It is Sunday\r\nafternoon; but on the dusty floor of the parade-ground a drama is\r\nbeing enacted which is suggestive of anything but Sabbath peace. The\r\nquarter-guard of the 34th Native Infantry—tall men, erect and soldierly,\r\nand nearly all high-caste Brahmins—is drawn up in regular order. Behind\r\nit chatters and sways and eddies a confused mass of Sepoys, in all stages\r\nof dress and undress; some armed, some unarmed; but all fermenting with\r\nexcitement. Some thirty yards in front of the line of the 34th swaggers\r\nto and fro a Sepoy named Mungul Pandy. He is half-drunk with bhang, and\r\nwholly drunk with religious fanaticism. Chin in air, loaded musket in\r\nhand, he struts backwards and forwards, at a sort of half-dance, shouting\r\nin shrill and nasal monotone, “Come out, you blackguards! Turn out, all\r\nof you! The English are upon us. Through biting these cartridges we shall\r\nall be made infidels!”\r\n\r\nThe man, in fact, is in that condition of mingled bhang and “nerves”\r\nwhich makes a Malay run amok; and every shout from his lips runs like\r\na wave of sudden flame through the brains and along the nerves of the\r\nlistening crowd of fellow-Sepoys. And as the Sepoys off duty come running\r\nup from every side, the crowd grows ever bigger, the excitement more\r\nintense, the tumult of chattering voices more passionate. A human powder\r\nmagazine, in a word, is about to explode.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there appears upon the scene the English adjutant, Lieutenant\r\nBaugh. A runner has brought the news to him as he lies in the sultry\r\nquiet of the Sunday afternoon in his quarters. The English officer is a\r\nman of decision. A saddled horse stands ready in the stable; he thrusts\r\nloaded pistols into the holsters, buckles on his sword, and gallops\r\nto the scene of trouble. The sound of galloping hoofs turns all Sepoy\r\neyes up the road; and as that red-coated figure, the symbol of military\r\nauthority, draws near, excitement through the Sepoy crowd goes up\r\nuncounted degrees. They are about to witness a duel between revolt and\r\ndiscipline, between a mutineer and an adjutant!\r\n\r\nMungul Pandy has at least one quality of a good soldier. He can face\r\nperil coolly. He steadies himself, and grows suddenly silent. He stands\r\nin the track of the galloping horse, musket at shoulder, the man himself\r\nmoveless as a bronze image. And steadily the Englishman rides down upon\r\nhim! The Sepoy’s musket suddenly flashes; the galloping horse swerves and\r\nstumbles; horse and man roll in the white dust of the road. But the horse\r\nonly has been hit, and the adjutant struggles, dusty and bruised, from\r\nunder the fallen beast, plucks a loaded pistol from the holster, and runs\r\nstraight at the mutineer. Within ten paces of him he lifts his pistol\r\nand fires. There is a flash of red pistol-flame, a puff of white smoke,\r\na gleam of whirling sword-blade. But a man who has just scrambled up,\r\nhalf-stunned, from a fallen horse, can scarcely be expected to shine as a\r\nmarksman. Baugh has missed his man, and in another moment is himself cut\r\ndown by Mungul Pandy’s tulwar. At this sight a Mohammedan Sepoy—Mungul\r\nPandy was a Brahmin—runs out and catches the uplifted wrist of the\r\nvictorious Mungul. Here is one Sepoy, at least, who cannot look on and\r\nsee his English officer slain—least of all by a cow-worshipping Hindu!\r\n\r\nAgain the sound of running feet is heard on the road. It is the English\r\nsergeant-major, who has followed his officer, and he, too—red of face,\r\nscant of breath, but plucky of spirit—charges straight at the mutinous\r\nPandy. But a sergeant-major, stout and middle-aged, who has run in\r\nuniform three-quarters of a mile on an Indian road and under an Indian\r\nsun, is scarcely in good condition for engaging in a single combat with\r\na bhang-maddened Sepoy, and he, in turn, goes down under the mutineer’s\r\ntulwar.\r\n\r\nHow the white teeth gleam, and the black eyes flash, through the crowd of\r\nexcited Sepoys! The clamour of voices takes a new shrillness. Two sahibs\r\nare down before their eyes, under the victorious arm of one of their\r\ncomrades! The men who form the quarter-guard of the 34th, at the orders\r\nof their native officer, run forward a few paces at the double, but they\r\ndo not attempt to seize the mutineer. Their sympathies are with him. They\r\nhalt; they sway to and fro. The nearest smite with the butt-end of their\r\nmuskets at the two wounded Englishmen.\r\n\r\nA cluster of British officers by this time is on the scene; the colonel\r\nof the 34th himself has come up, and naturally takes command. He orders\r\nthe men of the quarter-guard to seize the mutineers, and is told by the\r\nnative officer in charge that the men “will not go on.” The colonel is,\r\nunhappily, not of the stuff of which heroes are made. He looks through\r\nhis spectacles at Mungul Pandy. A six-foot Sepoy in open revolt, loaded\r\nmusket in hand—himself loaded more dangerously by fanaticism strongly\r\nflavoured with bhang—while a thousand excited Sepoys look on trembling\r\nwith angry sympathy, does not make a cheerful spectacle. “I felt it\r\nuseless,” says the bewildered colonel, in his official report after the\r\nincident, “going on any further in the matter.... It would have been a\r\nuseless sacrifice of life to order a European officer of the guard to\r\nseize him.... I left the guard and reported the matter to the brigadier.”\r\nUnhappy colonel! He may have had his red-tape virtues, but he was clearly\r\nnot the man to suppress a mutiny. The mutiny, in a word, suppressed him!\r\nAnd let it be imagined how the spectacle of that hesitating colonel added\r\na new element of wondering delight to the huge crowd of swaying Sepoys.\r\n\r\nAt this moment General Hearsey, the brigadier in charge, rides on to\r\nthe parade-ground: a red-faced, wrathful, hard-fighting, iron-nerved\r\nveteran, with two sons, of blood as warlike as their father’s, riding\r\nbehind him as aides. Hearsey, with quick military glance, takes in the\r\nwhole scene—the mob of excited Sepoys, the sullen quarter-guard, the two\r\nred-coats lying in the road, and the victorious Mungul Pandy, musket\r\nin hand. As he rode up somebody called out, “Have a care; his musket\r\nis loaded.” To which the General replied, with military brevity, “Damn\r\nhis musket!” “An oath,” says Trevelyan, “concerning which every true\r\nEnglishman will make the customary invocation to the recording angel.”\r\n\r\nMungul Pandy covered the General with his musket. Hearsey found time to\r\nsay to his son, “If I fall, John, rush in and put him to death somehow.”\r\nThen, pulling up his horse on the flank of the quarter-guard, he plucked\r\na pistol from his holster, levelled it straight at the head of the native\r\nofficer, and curtly ordered the men to advance and seize the mutineer.\r\nThe level pistol, no doubt, had its own logic; but more effective than\r\neven the steady and tiny tube was the face that looked from behind it,\r\nwith command and iron courage in every line. That masterful British will\r\ninstantly asserted itself. The loose line of the quarter-guard stiffened\r\nwith instinctive obedience; the men stepped forward; and Mungul Pandy,\r\nwith one unsteady glance at Hearsey’s stern visage, turned with a quick\r\nmovement the muzzle of his gun to his own breast, thrust his naked toe\r\ninto the trigger, and fell, self-shot. He survived to be hanged, with due\r\nofficial ceremonies, seven days afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt was a true instinct which, after this, taught the British soldier\r\nto call every mutinous Sepoy a “Pandy.” That incident at Barrackpore\r\nis really the history of the Indian Mutiny in little. All its elements\r\nare there: the bhang-stimulated fanaticism of the Sepoy, with its quick\r\ncontagion, running through all Sepoy ranks; the hasty rush of the\r\nsolitary officer, gallant, but ill-fated, a single man trying to suppress\r\na regiment. Here, too, is the colonel of the 34th, who, with a cluster of\r\nregiments on the point of mutiny, decides that it is “useless” to face\r\na dangerously excited Sepoy armed with a musket, and retires to “report”\r\nthe business to his brigadier. He is the type of that failure of official\r\nnerve—fortunately very rare—which gave the Mutiny its early successes.\r\nGeneral Hearsey, again, with his grim “D⸺ his musket!” supplies the\r\nexample of that courage, swift, fierce, and iron-nerved, that in the end\r\ncrushed the Mutiny and restored the British Empire in India.\r\n\r\nThe Great Mutiny, as yet, has found neither its final historian, nor\r\nits sufficient poet. What other nation can show in its record such a\r\ncycle of heroism as that which lies in the history of the British in\r\nIndia between May 10, 1857—the date of the Meerut outbreak, and the\r\ntrue beginning of the Mutiny—and November 1, 1858, when the Queen’s\r\nproclamation officially marked its close? But the heroes in that great\r\nepisode—the men of Lucknow, and Delhi, and Arrah, the men who marched\r\nand fought under Havelock, who held the Ridge at Delhi under Wilson,\r\nwho stormed the Alumbagh under Clyde—though they could make history,\r\ncould not write it. There are a hundred “Memoirs,” and “Journals,” and\r\n“Histories” of the great revolt, but the Mutiny still waits for its\r\nThucydides and its Napier. Trevelyan’s “Cawnpore,” it is true, will hold\r\nits readers breathless with its fire, and movement, and graphic force;\r\nbut it deals with only one picturesque and dreadful episode of the Great\r\nMutiny. The “History of the Mutiny,” by Kaye and Malleson, is laborious,\r\nhonest, accurate; but no one can pretend that it is very readable. It\r\nhas Kinglake’s diffuseness without Kinglake’s literary charm. The work,\r\ntoo, is a sort of literary duet of a very controversial sort. Colonel\r\nMalleson, from the notes, continually contradicts Sir John Kaye in the\r\ntext, and he does it with a bluntness, and a diligence, which have quite\r\na humorous effect.\r\n\r\nNot only is the Mutiny without an historian, but it remains without any\r\nfinally convincing analysis of its causes. Justin McCarthy’s summary of\r\nthe causes of the Mutiny, as given in his “History of Our Own Times,” is\r\na typical example of wrong-headed judgment. Mr. McCarthy contemplates the\r\nMutiny through the lens of his own politics, and almost regards it with\r\ncomplacency as a mere struggle for Home Rule! It was not a Mutiny, he\r\nsays, like that at the Nore; it was a revolution, like that in France at\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century. It was “a national and religious war,”\r\na rising of the many races of India against the too oppressive Saxon. The\r\nnative princes were in it as well as the native soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe plain facts of the case are fatal to that theory. The struggle was\r\nconfined to one Presidency out of three. Only two dynastic princes—Nana\r\nSahib and the Ranee of Jhansi—joined in the outbreak. The people in the\r\ncountry districts were passive; the British revenue, except over the\r\nactual field of strife, was regularly paid. If their own trained native\r\nsoldiery turned against the British, other natives thronged in thousands\r\nto their flag. A hundred examples might be given where native loyalty and\r\nvalour saved the situation for the English.\r\n\r\nThere were Sepoys on both sides of the entrenchment at Lucknow. Counting\r\ncamp followers, native servants, &c., there were two black faces to every\r\nwhite face under the British flag which fluttered so proudly over the\r\nhistoric Ridge at Delhi. The “protected” Sikh chiefs, by their fidelity,\r\nkept British authority from temporary collapse betwixt the Jumna and\r\nthe Sutlej. They formed what Sir Richard Temple calls “a political\r\nbreakwater,” on which the fury of rebellious Hindustan broke in vain. The\r\nChief of Pattalia employed 5000 troops in guarding the trunk road betwixt\r\nthe Punjaub and Delhi, along which reinforcements and warlike supplies\r\nwere flowing to the British force on the Ridge. This enabled the whole\r\nstrength of the British to be concentrated on the siege. The Chief of\r\nJhind was the first native ruler who appeared in the field with an armed\r\nforce on the British side, and his troops took part in the final assault\r\non Delhi. Golab Singh sent from his principality, stretching along the\r\nfoot of the Himalayas, strong reinforcements to the British troops\r\nbesieging Delhi. “The sight of these troops moving against the mutineers\r\nin the darkest hour of British fortunes produced,” says Sir Richard\r\nTemple, “a profound moral effect on the Punjaub.”\r\n\r\nIf John Lawrence had to disband or suppress 36,000 mutinous Sepoys in\r\nthe Punjaub, he was able to enlist from Ghoorkas and Sikhs and the wild\r\ntribes on the Afghan borders more than another 36,000 to take their\r\nplaces. He fed the scanty and gallant force which kept the British flag\r\nflying before Delhi with an ever-flowing stream of native soldiers of\r\nsufficient fidelity. At the time of the Mutiny there were 38,000 British\r\nsoldiers in a population of 180,000,000. If the Mutiny had been indeed\r\na “national” uprising, what chances of survival would the handful of\r\nBritish have had?\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that the Mutiny, in its later stages, drew to itself\r\npolitical forces, and took a political aspect. The Hindu Sepoy, says\r\nHerbert Edwardes, “having mutinied about a cartridge, had nothing to\r\npropose for an Empire, and fell in, of necessity, with the only policy\r\nwhich was feasible at the moment, a Mohammedan king of Delhi. And so,\r\nwith a revived Mogul dynasty at its head, the Mutiny took the form of\r\na struggle between the Moslem and the Christian for empire, and this\r\nagitated every village in which there was a mosque or a mollah.” But\r\nthe emergence of the Mogul dynasty in the struggle was an afterthought,\r\nnot to say, an accident. The old king at Delhi, discrowned and almost\r\nforgotten, was caught up by the mutineers as a weapon or a flag.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak was thus, at the beginning, a purely military mutiny;\r\nbut its complexion and character later on were affected by local\r\ncircumstances. In Oude, for example, the Mutiny was welcomed, as it\r\nseemed to offer those dispossessed by the recent annexation, a chance\r\nof revenge. At Delhi it found a centre in the old king’s palace, an\r\ninspiration in Mohammedan fanaticism, and a nominal leader in the\r\nrepresentative of the old Mogul dynasty. So the Mutiny grew into a new\r\nstruggle for empire on the part of some of the Mohammedan princes.\r\n\r\nMany of the contributing causes of the Mutiny are clear enough.\r\nDiscipline had grown perilously lax throughout Bengal; and the Bengal\r\ntroops were, of all who marched under the Company’s flag, the most\r\ndangerous when once they got out of hand. They consisted mainly of\r\nhigh-caste Brahmins and Rajpoots. They burned with caste pride. They were\r\nof incredible arrogance. The regiments, too, were made up largely of\r\nmembers of the same clan, and each regiment had its own complete staff\r\nof native officers. Conspiracy was easy in such a body. Secrets were\r\nsafe. Interests and passions were common. When the British officers had\r\nall been slaughtered out, the regiment, as a fighting machine, was yet\r\nperfect. Each regiment was practically a unit, knit together by ties of\r\ncommon blood, and speech, and faith, ruled by common superstitions, and\r\nswayed by common passions.\r\n\r\nThe men had the petulance and the ignorance of children. They believed\r\nthat the entire population of England consisted of 100,000 souls. When\r\nthe first regiment of Highlanders landed, the whisper ran across the\r\nwhole Presidency, that there were no more men in England, and that, in\r\ndefault of men, the women had been sent out! Later on, says Trevelyan,\r\nthe native mind evolved another theory to explain the Highlanders’ kilts.\r\nThey wore petticoats, it was whispered, as a public and visible symbol\r\nthat their mission was to take vengeance for the murder of English ladies.\r\n\r\nMany causes combined to enervate military discipline. There had been\r\npetty mutinies again and again, unavenged, or only half avenged.\r\nMutineers had been petted, instead of being shot or hanged. Lord\r\nDalhousie had weakened the despotic authority of the commanding officers,\r\nand had taught the Sepoy to appeal to the Government against his officers.\r\n\r\nNow the Sepoy has one Celtic quality: his loyalty must have a personal\r\nobject. He will endure, or even love, a despot, but it must be a despot\r\nhe can see and hear. He can be ruled; but it must be by a person, not by\r\na “system.” When the commander of a regiment of Sepoys ceased to be a\r\ndespot, the symbol and centre of all authority, and became only a knot in\r\na line of official red tape, he lost the respect of his Sepoys, and the\r\npower to control them. Said Rajah Maun Singh, in a remarkable letter to\r\nthe Talookdars of his province: “There used to be twenty to twenty-five\r\nBritish officers to every 1000 men, and these officers were subordinate\r\nto one single man. But nowadays there are 1000 officers and 1000 kings\r\namong 1000 men: the men are officers and kings themselves, and when such\r\nis the case there are no soldiers to fight.”\r\n\r\nUpon this mass of armed men, who had lost the first of soldierly habits,\r\nobedience, and who were fermenting with pride, fanaticism, and ignorance,\r\nthere blew what the Hindus themselves called a “Devil’s wind,” charged\r\nwith a thousand deadly influences. The wildest rumours ran from barracks\r\nto barracks. One of those mysterious and authorless predictions which\r\nrun before, and sometimes cause, great events was current. Plassey was\r\nfought in 1757; the English raj, the prediction ran, would last exactly\r\na century; so 1857 must see its fall. Whether the prophecy was Hindu or\r\nMohammedan cannot be decided; but it had been current for a quarter of a\r\ncentury, and both Hindu and Mohammedan quoted it and believed it. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the great Company did actually expire in 1857!\r\n\r\nGood authorities hold that the greased cartridges were something more\r\nthan the occasion of the Mutiny; they were its supreme producing cause.\r\nThe history of the greased cartridges may be told almost in a sentence.\r\n“Brown Bess” had grown obsolete; the new rifle, with its grooved barrel,\r\nneeded a lubricated cartridge, and it was whispered that the cartridge\r\nwas greased with a compound of cow’s fat and swine’s fat, charged with\r\nvillainous theological properties. It would destroy at once the caste of\r\nthe Hindu, and the ceremonial purity of the Mohammedan! Sir John Lawrence\r\ndeclares that “the proximate cause of the Mutiny was the cartridge\r\naffair, and nothing else.” Mr. Lecky says that “recent researches have\r\nfully proved that the real, as well as the ostensible, cause of the\r\nMutiny was the greased cartridges.” He adds, this is “a shameful and\r\nterrible fact.” The Sepoys, he apparently holds, were right in their\r\nbelief that in the grease that smeared the cartridges was hidden a\r\nconspiracy against their religion! “If mutiny,” Mr. Lecky adds, “was ever\r\njustifiable, no stronger justification could be given than that of the\r\nSepoy troops.”\r\n\r\nBut is this accusation valid? That the military authorities really\r\ndesigned to inflict a religious wrong on the Sepoys in the matter of the\r\ncartridges no one, of course, believes. But there was, undoubtedly, much\r\nof heavy-handed clumsiness in the official management of the business.\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, no greased cartridges were actually issued\r\nto any Sepoys. Some had been sent out from England, for the purpose of\r\ntesting them under the Indian climate; large numbers had been actually\r\nmanufactured in India; but the Sepoys took the alarm early, and none of\r\nthe guilty cartridges were actually issued to the men. “From first to\r\nlast,” says Kaye, “no such cartridges were ever issued to the Sepoys,\r\nsave, perhaps, to a Ghoorka regiment, at their own request.”\r\n\r\nWhen once, however, the suspicions of the Sepoys were, rightly or\r\nwrongly, aroused, it was impossible to soothe them. The men were told\r\nthat they might grease the cartridges themselves; but the paper in\r\nwhich the new cartridges were wrapped had now, to alarmed Sepoy eyes, a\r\nsuspiciously greasy look, and the men refused to handle it.\r\n\r\nThe Sepoy conscience was, in truth, of very eccentric sensitiveness.\r\nNative hands made up the accused cartridges without concern; the Sepoys\r\nthemselves used them freely—when they could get them—against the British\r\nafter the Mutiny broke out. But a fanatical belief on the part of the\r\nSepoys, that these particular cartridges concealed in their greasy folds\r\na dark design against their religion, was undoubtedly the immediate\r\noccasion of the Great Mutiny. Yet it would be absurd to regard this as\r\nits single producing cause. In order to assert this, we must forget all\r\nthe other evil forces at work to produce the cataclysm: the annexation of\r\nOude; the denial of the sacred right of “adoption” to the native princes;\r\nthe decay of discipline in the Sepoy ranks; the loss of reverence for\r\ntheir officers by the men, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Sepoys, it is clear, were, on many grounds, discontented with the\r\nconditions of their service. The keen, brooding, and somewhat melancholy\r\ngenius of Henry Lawrence foresaw the coming trouble, and fastened on this\r\nas one of its causes. In an article written in March 1856, he says that\r\nthe conditions of the Indian Army denied a career to any native soldier\r\nof genius, and this must put the best brains of the Sepoys in quarrel\r\nwith the British rule. Ninety out of every hundred Sepoys, he said in\r\nsubstance, are satisfied; but the remaining ten are discontented, some\r\nof them to a dangerous degree; and the discontented ten were the best\r\nsoldiers of the hundred! But, as it happened, the Mutiny threw up no\r\nnative soldier of genius, except, perhaps, Tantia Topee, who was _not_ a\r\nSepoy!\r\n\r\n“The salt water” was undoubtedly amongst the minor causes which provoked\r\nthe Mutiny. The Sepoys dreaded the sea; they believed they could not\r\ncross it without a fatal loss of caste, and the new form of military\r\noath, which made the Sepoy liable for over-sea service, was believed, by\r\nthe veterans, to extend to them, even though they had not taken it: and\r\nso the Sepoy imagination was disquieted.\r\n\r\nLord Dalhousie’s over-Anglicised policy, it may be added, was at once too\r\nliberal, and too impatient, for the Eastern mind, with its obstinacy of\r\nhabit, its hatred of change, its easily-roused suspiciousness. As Kaye\r\nputs it, Lord Dalhousie poured his new wine into old bottles, with too\r\nrash a hand. “The wine was good wine, strong wine, wine to gladden the\r\nheart of man;” but poured into such ancient and shrunken bottles too\r\nrashly, it was fatal. It was because we were “too English,” adds Kaye,\r\nthat the great crisis arose; and “it was only because we were English\r\nthat, when it arose, it did not overwhelm us.” We trod, in a word, with\r\nheavy-footed British clumsiness on the historic superstitions, the\r\nancient habitudes of the Sepoys, and so provoked them to revolt. But the\r\ndour British character, which is at the root of British clumsiness, in\r\nthe end, overbore the revolt.\r\n\r\nThe very virtues of the British rule, thus proved its peril. Its cool\r\njustice, its steadfast enforcement of order, its tireless warfare against\r\ncrime, made it hated of all the lawless and predatory classes. Every\r\nnative who lived by vice, chafed under a justice which might be slow and\r\npassionless, but which could not be bribed, and in the long-run could not\r\nbe escaped.\r\n\r\nSome, at least, of the dispossessed princes, diligently fanned these\r\nwild dreams and wilder suspicions which haunted the Sepoy mind, till\r\nit kindled into a flame. The Sepoys were told they had conquered India\r\nfor the English; why should they not now conquer it for themselves? The\r\nchupatties—mysterious signals, coming whence no man knew, and meaning, no\r\nman could tell exactly what—passed from village to village. Usually with\r\nthe chupatti ran a message—“Sub lal hojaega” (“everything will become\r\nred”)—a Sibylline announcement, which might be accepted as a warning\r\nagainst the too rapid spread of the English raj, or a grim prediction\r\nof universal bloodshed. Whence the chupatties came, or what they exactly\r\nmeant, is even yet a matter of speculation. The one thing certain is,\r\nthey were a storm signal, not very intelligible, perhaps, but highly\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nThat there was a conspiracy throughout Bengal for the simultaneous revolt\r\nof all Sepoys on May 31, cannot be doubted, and, on the whole, it was\r\nwell for the English raj that the impatient troopers broke out at Meerut\r\nbefore the date agreed upon.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Temple, whose task it was to examine the ex-king of Delhi’s\r\npapers after the capture of the city, found amongst them an immense\r\nnumber of letters and reports from leading Mohammedans—priests and\r\nothers. These letters glowed with fanatical fire. Temple declared they\r\nconvinced him that “Mohammedan fanaticism is a volcanic agency, which\r\nwill probably burst forth in eruptions from time to time.” But were\r\nChristian missions any source of political peril to British rule in\r\nIndia? On this point John Lawrence’s opinion ought to be final. He\r\ndrafted a special despatch on the subject, and Sir Richard Temple, who\r\nwas then his secretary, declares he “conned over and over again every\r\nparagraph as it was drafted.” It represented his final judgment on the\r\nsubject. He held that “Christian things done in a Christian way could\r\nnever be politically dangerous in India.” While scrupulously abstaining\r\nfrom interference in the religions of the people, the Government, he\r\nheld, “should be more explicit than before”—not less explicit—“in avowing\r\nits Christian character.”\r\n\r\nThe explanation offered by the aged king of Delhi, is terse, and has\r\nprobably as much of truth as more lengthy and philosophical theories.\r\nColonel Vibart relates how, after the capture of Delhi, he went to see\r\nthe king, and found him sitting cross-legged on a native bedstead,\r\nrocking himself to and fro. He was “a small and attenuated old man,\r\napparently between eighty and ninety years of age, with a long white\r\nbeard, and almost totally blind.” Some one asked the old king what was\r\nthe real cause of the outbreak at Delhi. “I don’t know,” was the reply;\r\n“I suppose my people gave themselves up to the devil!”\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the British forces in Bengal, in 1857, it may be\r\nnoted, made mutiny easy and safe. We have learned the lesson of the\r\nMutiny to-day, and there are now 74,000 British troops, with 88 batteries\r\nof British artillery, in India, while the Sepoy regiments number only\r\n150,000, with 13 batteries of artillery. But in 1857, the British\r\ngarrison had sunk to 38,000, while the Sepoys numbered 200,000. Most of\r\nthe artillery was in native hands. In Bengal itself, it might almost be\r\nsaid, there were no British troops, the bulk of them being garrisoned on\r\nthe Afghan or Pegu frontiers. A map showing the distribution of troops\r\non May 1, 1857—Sepoys in black dots, and British in red—is a thing\r\nto meditate over. Such a map is pustuled with black dots, an inky way\r\nstretching from Cabul to Calcutta; while the red points gleam faintly,\r\nand at far-stretched intervals.\r\n\r\nAll the principal cities were without European troops. There were none\r\nat Delhi, none at Benares, none at Allahabad. In the whole province of\r\nOude there was only one British battery of artillery. The treasuries, the\r\narsenals, the roads of the North-West Provinces, might almost be said to\r\nbe wholly in the hands of Sepoys. Betwixt Meerut and Dinapore, a stretch\r\nof 1200 miles, there were to be found only two weak British regiments.\r\nNever was a prize so rich held with a hand so slack and careless! It was\r\nthe evil fate of England, too, that when the storm broke, some of the\r\nmost important posts were in the hands of men paralysed by mere routine,\r\nor in whom soldierly fire had been quenched by the chills of old age.\r\n\r\nOf the deeper sources of the Mutiny, John Lawrence held, that the great\r\nnumerical preponderance of the Sepoys in the military forces holding\r\nIndia, was the chief. “Was it to be expected,” he asked, “that the native\r\nsoldiery, who had charge of our fortresses, arsenals, magazines, and\r\ntreasuries, without adequate European control, should fail to gather\r\nextravagant ideas of their own importance?” It was the sense of power\r\nthat induced them to rebel. The balance of numbers, and of visible\r\nstrength, seemed to be overwhelmingly with them.\r\n\r\nTaken geographically, the story of the Mutiny has three centres, and\r\nmay be covered by the tragedy of Cawnpore, the assault on Delhi, and\r\nthe heroic defence and relief of Lucknow. Taken in order of time, it\r\nhas three stages. The first stretches from the outbreak at Meerut in\r\nMay to the end of September. This is the heroic stage of the Mutiny.\r\nNo reinforcements had arrived from England during these months. It was\r\nthe period of the massacres, and of the tragedy of Cawnpore. Yet during\r\nthose months Delhi was stormed, Cawnpore avenged, and Havelock made\r\nhis amazing march, punctuated with daily battles, for the relief of\r\nLucknow. The second stage extends from October 1857, to March 1858, when\r\nBritish troops were poured upon the scene of action, and Colin Campbell\r\nrecaptured Lucknow, and broke the strength of the revolt. The third stage\r\nextends to the close of 1858, and marks the final suppression of the\r\nMutiny.\r\n\r\nThe story, with its swift changes, its tragical sufferings, its\r\nalternation of disaster and triumph, is a warlike epic, and might rather\r\nbe sung in dithyrambic strains, than told in cold and halting prose.\r\nIf some genius could do for the Indian Mutiny what Napier has done for\r\nthe Peninsular War, it would be the most kindling bit of literature in\r\nthe English language. What a demonstration the whole story is, of the\r\nImperial genius of the British race! “A nation,” to quote Hodson—himself\r\none of the most brilliant actors in the great drama—“which could conquer\r\na country like the Punjaub, with a Hindoostanee army, then turn the\r\nenergies of the conquered Sikhs to subdue the very army by which they\r\nwere tamed; which could fight out a position like Peshawur for years, in\r\nthe very teeth of the Afghan tribes; and then, when suddenly deprived of\r\nthe regiments which effected this, could unhesitatingly employ those very\r\ntribes to disarm and quell those regiments when in mutiny—a nation which\r\ncould do this, is destined indeed to rule the world!”\r\n\r\nThese sketches do not pretend to be a reasoned and adequate “history” of\r\nthe Mutiny. They are, as their title puts it, the “Tale” of the Mutiny—a\r\nsimple chain of picturesque incidents, and, for the sake of dramatic\r\ncompleteness, the sketches are grouped round the three heroic names of\r\nthe Mutiny—Cawnpore, Lucknow, and Delhi. Only the chief episodes in the\r\ngreat drama can be dealt with in a space so brief, and they will be told\r\nin simple fashion as tales, which illustrate the soldierly daring of the\r\nmen, and the heroic fortitude of the women, of our race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the evening of May 10, 1857, the church bells were sounding their\r\ncall to prayer across the parade-ground, and over the roofs of the\r\ncantonment at Meerut. It had been a day of fierce heat; the air had\r\nscorched like a white flame; all day long fiery winds had blown, hot as\r\nfrom the throat of a seven times heated furnace. The tiny English colony\r\nat Meerut—languid women, white-faced children, and officers in loosest\r\nundress—panted that long Sunday in their houses, behind the close blinds,\r\nand under the lazily swinging punkahs. But the cool night had come, the\r\nchurch bells were ringing, and in the dusk of evening, officers and their\r\nwives were strolling or driving towards the church. They little dreamed\r\nthat the call of the church bells, as it rose and sank over the roofs\r\nof the native barracks, was, for many of them, the signal of doom. It\r\nsummoned the native troops of Meerut to revolt; it marked the beginning\r\nof the Great Mutiny.\r\n\r\nYet the very last place, at which an explosion might have been expected,\r\nwas Meerut. It was the one post in the north-west where the British\r\nforces were strongest. The Rifles were there, 1000 strong; the 6th\r\nDragoons (Carabineers), 600 strong; together with a fine troop of horse\r\nartillery, and details of various other regiments. Not less, in a word,\r\nthan 2200 British troops, in fair, if not in first-class, fighting\r\ncondition, were at the station, while the native regiments at Meerut,\r\nhorse and foot, did not reach 3000. It did not need a Lawrence or a\r\nHavelock at Meerut to make revolt impossible, or to stamp it instantly\r\nand fiercely out if it were attempted. A stroke of very ordinary\r\nsoldiership might have accomplished this; and in that event, the Great\r\nMutiny itself might have been averted.\r\n\r\nThe general in command at Meerut, however, had neither energy nor\r\nresolution. He had drowsed and nodded through some fifty years of routine\r\nservice, rising by mere seniority. He was now old, obese, indolent, and\r\nnotoriously incapable. He had agreeable manners, and a soothing habit of\r\nignoring disagreeable facts. Lord Melbourne’s favourite question, “Why\r\ncan’t you leave it alone?” represented General Hewitt’s intellect. These\r\nare qualities dear to the official mind, and explain General Hewitt’s\r\nrise to high rank, but they are not quite the gifts needed to suppress a\r\nmutiny. In General Hewitt’s case, the familiar fable of an army of lions\r\ncommanded by an ass, was translated into history once more.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of May 5 cartridges were being served out for the next\r\nmorning’s parade, and eighty-five men of the 3rd Native Cavalry refused\r\nto receive or handle them, though they were the old familiar greased\r\ncartridges, not the new, in whose curve, as we have seen, a conspiracy to\r\nrob the Hindu of his caste, and the Mohammedan of his ceremonial purity,\r\nwas vehemently suspected to exist. The men were tried by a court-martial\r\nof fifteen native officers—six of them being Mohammedans and nine\r\nHindus—and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the 9th, the whole military force of the station was\r\nassembled to witness the military degradation of the men. The British,\r\nwith muskets and cannon loaded, formed three sides of a hollow square;\r\non the fourth were drawn up the native regiments, sullen, agitated, yet\r\noverawed by the sabres of the Dragoons, the grim lines of the steady\r\nRifles, and the threatening muzzles of the loaded cannon. The eighty-five\r\nmutineers stood in the centre of the square.\r\n\r\nOne by one the men were stripped of their uniform—adorned in many\r\ninstances with badges and medals, the symbols of proved courage and of\r\nancient fidelity. One by one, with steady clang of hammer, the fetters\r\nwere riveted on the limbs of the mutineers, while white faces and dark\r\nfaces alike looked on. For a space of time, to be reckoned almost by\r\nhours, the monotonous beat of the hammer rang over the lines, steady as\r\nthough frozen into stone, of the stern British, and over the sea of dark\r\nSepoy faces that formed the fourth side of the square. In the eyes of\r\nthese men, at least, the eighty-five manacled felons were martyrs.\r\n\r\nThe parade ended; the dishonoured eighty-five marched off with clank of\r\nchained feet to the local gaol. But that night, in the huts and round the\r\ncamp fires of all the Sepoy regiments, the whispered talk was of mutiny\r\nand revenge. The very prostitutes in the native bazaars with angry scorn\r\nurged them to revolt. The men took fire. To wait for the 31st, the day\r\nfixed for simultaneous mutiny throughout Bengal, was too sore a trial for\r\ntheir patience. The next day was Sunday; the Sahibs would all be present\r\nat evening service in the church; they would be unarmed. So the church\r\nbells that called the British officers to prayer, should call their\r\nSepoys to mutiny.\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of that historic Sabbath evening, as the church bells awoke,\r\nand sent their pulses of clangorous sound over the cantonment, the men\r\nof the 3rd Native Cavalry broke from their quarters, and in wild tumult,\r\nwith brandished sabres and cries of “Deen! Deen!” galloped to the gaol,\r\nburst open the doors, and brought back in triumph the eighty-five\r\n“martyrs.” The Sepoy infantry regiments, the 11th and 20th, ran to\r\ntheir lines, and fell into rank under their native officers. A British\r\nsergeant, running with breathless speed, brought the news to Colonel\r\nFinnis of the 11th. “For God’s sake, sir,” he said, “fly! The men have\r\nmutinied.”\r\n\r\nFinnis, a cool and gallant veteran, was the last of men to “fly.” He\r\ninstantly rode down to the lines. The other British officers gathered\r\nround him, and for a brief space, with orders, gesticulations, and\r\nappeals, they held the swaying regiments steady, hoping every moment to\r\nhear the sound of the British dragoons and artillery sweeping to the\r\nscene of action. On the other side of the road stood the 20th Sepoys.\r\nThe British officers there also, with entreaties and remonstrances and\r\ngestures, were trying to keep the men in line. For an hour, while the\r\nevening deepened, that strange scene, of twenty or thirty Englishmen\r\nkeeping 2000 mutineers steady, lasted: and still there was no sound\r\nof rumbling guns, or beat of trampling hoofs, to tell of British\r\nartillery and sabres appearing on the scene. The general was asleep, or\r\nindifferent, or frightened, or helpless through sheer want of purpose or\r\nof brains!\r\n\r\nFinnis, who saw that the 20th were on the point of breaking loose, left\r\nhis own regiment, and rode over to help its officers. The dusk by this\r\ntime had deepened almost into darkness. A square, soldierly figure, only\r\ndimly seen, Finnis drew bridle in front of the sullen line of the 20th,\r\nand leaned over his horse’s neck to address the men. At that moment a\r\nfiercer wave of excitement ran across the regiment. The men began to call\r\nout in the rear ranks. Suddenly the muskets of the front line fell to the\r\npresent, a dancing splutter of flame swept irregularly along the front,\r\nand Finnis fell, riddled with bullets. The Great Mutiny had begun!\r\n\r\nThe 11th took fire at the sound of the crackling muskets of the 20th.\r\nThey refused, indeed, to shoot their own officers, but hustled them\r\nroughly off the ground. The 20th, however, by this time were shooting\r\nat every white face in sight. The 3rd Cavalry galloped on errands of\r\narson and murder to the officers’ houses. Flames broke out on every\r\nside. A score of bungalows were burning. The rabble in the bazaar added\r\nthemselves to the mutineers, and shouts from the mob, the long-drawn-out\r\nsplutter of venomous musketry, the shrieks of flying victims, broke the\r\nquiet of the Sabbath evening.\r\n\r\nSuch of the Europeans in Meerut that night as could make their escape to\r\nthe British lines were safe; but for the rest, every person of European\r\nblood who fell into the hands of the mutineers or of the bazaar rabble\r\nwas slain, irrespective of age or sex. Brave men were hunted like rats\r\nthrough the burning streets, or died, fighting for their wives and little\r\nones. English women were outraged and mutilated. Little children were\r\nimpaled on Sepoy bayonets, or hewn to bits with tulwars. And all this\r\nwithin rifle-shot of lines where might have been gathered, with a single\r\nbugle-blast, some 2200 British troops!\r\n\r\nGeneral Hewitt did, indeed, very late in the evening march his troops\r\non to the general parade-ground, and deployed them into line. But the\r\nSepoys had vanished; some on errands of murder and rapine, the great body\r\nclattering off in disconnected groups along the thirty odd miles of dusty\r\nroad, barred by two rivers, which led to Delhi.\r\n\r\nOne trivial miscalculation robbed the outbreak of what might well have\r\nbeen its most disastrous feature. The Sepoys calculated on finding the\r\nRifles, armed only with their side-arms, in the church. But on that\r\nvery evening, by some happy chance, the church parade was fixed for\r\nhalf-an-hour later than the previous Sunday. So the Native Cavalry\r\ngalloped down to the lines of the Rifles half-an-hour too soon, and found\r\ntheir intended victims actually under arms! They wheeled off promptly\r\ntowards the gaol; but the narrow margin of that half-hour saved the\r\nRifles from surprise and slaughter.\r\n\r\nHewitt had, as we have seen, in addition to the Rifles, a strong troop of\r\nhorse artillery and 600 British sabres in hand. He could have pursued the\r\nmutineers and cut them down ruthlessly in detail. The gallant officers\r\nof the Carabineers pleaded for an order to pursue, but in vain. Hewitt\r\ndid not even send news to Delhi of the revolt! With a regiment of British\r\nrifles, 1000 strong, standing in line, he did not so much as shoot down,\r\nwith one fierce and wholesome volley, the budmashes, who were busy in\r\nmurder and outrage among the bungalows. When day broke Meerut showed\r\nstreets of ruins blackened with fire, and splashed red with the blood of\r\nmurdered Englishmen and Englishwomen. According to the official report,\r\n“groups of savages were actually seen gloating over the mangled and\r\nmutilated remains of their victims.” Yet Hewitt thought he satisfied\r\nall the obligations of a British soldier by peacefully and methodically\r\ncollecting the bodies of slaughtered Englishmen and Englishwomen. He did\r\nnot shoot or hang a single murderer!\r\n\r\nIt is idle, indeed, to ask what the English at Meerut did on the night\r\nof the 10th; it is simpler to say what they did not do. Hewitt did\r\nnothing that night; did nothing with equal diligence the next day—while\r\nthe Sepoys that had fled from Meerut were slaying at will in the streets\r\nof Delhi. He allowed his brigade, in a helpless fashion, to bivouac\r\non the parade-ground; then, in default of any ideas of his own, took\r\nsomebody else’s equally helpless advice, and led his troops back to their\r\ncantonments to protect them!\r\n\r\nGeneral Hewitt explained afterwards that while he was responsible for\r\nthe district, his brigadier, Archdale Wilson, was in command of the\r\nstation. Wilson replied that “by the regulations, Section XVII.,” he was\r\nunder the directions of General Hewitt, and, if he did nothing, it was\r\nbecause that inert warrior ordered nothing to be done. Wilson, it seems,\r\nadvised Hewitt not to attempt any pursuit, as it was uncertain which way\r\nthe mutineers had gone. That any attempt might be made to dispel that\r\nuncertainty did not occur, apparently, to either of the two surprising\r\nofficers in command at Meerut! A battery of galloper guns outside the\r\ngates of Delhi might have saved that city. It might, indeed, have\r\narrested the Great Mutiny.\r\n\r\nBut all India waited, listening in vain for the sound of Hewitt’s cannon.\r\nThe divisional commander was reposing in his arm-chair at Meerut; his\r\nbrigadier was contemplating “the regulations, Section XVII.,” and\r\nfinding there reasons for doing nothing, while mutiny went unwhipped\r\nat Meerut, and was allowed at Delhi to find a home, a fortress, and a\r\ncrowned head! It was rumoured, indeed, and believed for a moment, over\r\nhalf India, that the British in Meerut had perished to a man. How else\r\ncould it be explained that, at a crisis so terrible, they had vanished\r\nso completely from human sight and hearing? Not till May 24—a fortnight\r\nafter the outbreak—did a party of Dragoons move out from Meerut to\r\nsuppress some local plunderers in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOne flash of wrathful valour, it is true, lights up the ignominy of this\r\nstory. A native butcher was boasting in the bazaar at Meerut how he had\r\nkilled the wife of the adjutant of the 11th. One of the officers of\r\nthat regiment heard the story. He suddenly made his appearance in the\r\nbazaar, seized the murderer, and brought him away a captive, holding a\r\nloaded pistol to his head. A drum-head court-martial was improvised,\r\nand the murderer was promptly hanged. But this represents well-nigh the\r\nonly attempt made at Meerut during the first hours after the outbreak to\r\npunish the mutiny and vindicate law.\r\n\r\nColonel Mackenzie, indeed, relates one other incident of a kind to supply\r\na grim satisfaction to the humane imagination even at this distance of\r\ntime. Mackenzie was a subaltern in one of the revolting regiments—the\r\n3rd Bengal Light Cavalry. When the mutiny broke out he rode straight\r\nto the lines, did his best to hold the men steady, and finally had to\r\nride for his life with two brother officers, Lieutenant Craigie and\r\nLieutenant Clarke. Here is Colonel Mackenzie’s story. The group, it must\r\nbe remembered, were riding at a gallop.\r\n\r\n    The telegraph lines were cut, and a slack wire, which I did\r\n    not see, as it swung across the road, caught me full on the\r\n    chest, and bowled me over into the dust. Over my prostrate body\r\n    poured the whole column of our followers, and I well remember\r\n    my feelings as I looked up at the shining hoofs. Fortunately\r\n    I was not hurt, and regaining my horse, I remounted, and soon\r\n    nearly overtook Craigie and Clarke, when I was horror-struck\r\n    to see a palanquin-gharry—a sort of box-shaped venetian-sided\r\n    carriage—being dragged slowly onwards by its driverless horse,\r\n    while beside it rode a trooper of the 3rd Cavalry, plunging\r\n    his sword repeatedly through the open window into the body of\r\n    its already dead occupant—an unfortunate European woman. But\r\n    Nemesis was upon the murderer. In a moment Craigie had dealt\r\n    him a swinging cut across the back of the neck, and Clarke had\r\n    run him through the body. The wretch fell dead, the first Sepoy\r\n    victim at Meerut to the sword of the avenger of blood.\r\n\r\nFor the next few weeks Hewitt was, probably, the best execrated man\r\nin all India. We have only to imagine what would have happened if a\r\nLawrence, instead of a Hewitt, had commanded at Meerut that night, to\r\nrealise for how much one fool counts in human history. That Hewitt did\r\nnot stamp out mutiny or avenge murder in Meerut was bad; his most fatal\r\nblunder was, that he neither pursued the mutineers in their flight to\r\nDelhi, nor marched hard on their tracks to the help of the little British\r\ncolony there.\r\n\r\nLord Roberts, indeed, holds that pursuit would have been “futile,” and\r\nthat no action by the British commanders at Meerut could have saved\r\nDelhi; and this is the judgment, recorded in cold blood nearly forty\r\nyears afterwards, by one of the greatest of British soldiers. Had the\r\nLord Roberts of Candahar, however, been in command himself at Meerut, it\r\nmay be shrewdly suspected the mutineers would not have gone unpursued,\r\nnor Delhi unwarned! Amateur judgments are not, of course, to be trusted\r\nin military affairs; but to the impatient civilian judgment, it seems as\r\nif the massacres in Delhi, the long and bitter siege, the whole tragical\r\ntale of the Mutiny, might have been avoided if Hewitt had possessed one\r\nthrill of the fierce energy of Nicholson, or one breath of the proud\r\ncourage of Havelock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDELHI\r\n\r\n\r\nDelhi lies thirty-eight miles to the south-west of Meerut, a city\r\nseven miles in circumference, ancient, stately, beautiful. The sacred\r\nJumna runs by it. Its grey, wide-curving girdle of crenellated walls,\r\nis pierced with seven gates. It is a city of mosques and palaces and\r\ngardens, and crowded native bazaars. Delhi in 1857 was of great political\r\nimportance, if only because the last representative of the Grand Mogul,\r\nstill bearing the title of the King of Delhi, resided there in semi-royal\r\nstate. The Imperial Palace, with its crowd of nearly 12,000 inmates,\r\nformed a sort of tiny royal city within Delhi itself, and here, if\r\nanywhere, mutiny might find a centre and a head.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the huge magazines, stored with munitions of war, made the city\r\nof the utmost military value to the British. Yet, by special treaty, no\r\nBritish troops were lodged in Delhi itself; there were none encamped even\r\non the historic Ridge outside it.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd Cavalry, heading the long flight of mutineers, reached Delhi in\r\nthe early morning of the 11th of May. They spurred across the bridge,\r\nslew the few casual Englishmen they met as they swept through the\r\nstreets, galloped to the king’s palace, and with loud shouts announced\r\nthat they had “slain all the English at Meerut, and had come to fight for\r\nthe faith.”\r\n\r\nThe king, old and nervous, hesitated. He had no reason for revolt.\r\nAmbition was dead in him. His estates had thriven under British\r\nadministration. His revenues had risen from a little over £40,000 to\r\n£140,000. He enjoyed all that he asked of the universe, a lazy, sensual,\r\nopium-soaked life. Why should he exchange a musky and golden sloth, to\r\nthe Indian imagination so desirable, for the dreadful perils of revolt\r\nand war? But the palace at Delhi was a moral plague-spot, a nest of\r\npoisonous insects, a vast household in which fermented every bestial\r\npassion to which human nature can sink. And discontent gave edge and fire\r\nto every other evil force. A spark falling into such a magazine might\r\nwell produce an explosion. And the shouts of the revolted troopers from\r\nMeerut at its gates supplied the necessary spark.\r\n\r\nWhile the old king doubted, and hesitated, and scolded, the palace guards\r\nopened the gates to the men of the 3rd Cavalry, who instantly swept in\r\nand slaughtered the English officials and English ladies found in it.\r\nElsewhere mutiny found many victims. The Delhi Bank was attacked and\r\nplundered, and the clerks and the manager with his family were slain.\r\nThe office of the _Delhi Gazette_ shared the same fate, the unfortunate\r\ncompositors being killed in the very act of setting up the “copy” which\r\ntold of the tragedy at Meerut. All Europeans found that day in the\r\nstreets of Delhi, down to the very babies, were killed without pity.\r\n\r\nThere were, as we have said, no white troops in Delhi. The city was held\r\nby a Sepoy garrison, the 38th, 54th, and 74th Sepoy regiments, with a\r\nbattery of Sepoy artillery. The British officers of these regiments, when\r\nnews of the Meerut outbreak reached them, made no doubt but that Hewitt’s\r\nartillery and cavalry from Meerut would follow fierce and fast on the\r\nheels of the mutineers. The Sepoys were exhorted briefly to be true to\r\ntheir salt, and the men stepped cheerfully off to close and hold the city\r\ngates against the mutineers.\r\n\r\nThe chief scene of interest for the next few hours was the main-guard\r\nof the Cashmere Gate. This was a small fortified enclosure in the rear\r\nof the great gate itself, always held by a guard of fifty Sepoys under\r\na European officer. A low verandah ran around the inner wall of the\r\nmain-guard, inside which, were the quarters of the Sepoys; a ramp or\r\nsloping stone causeway led to the summit of the gate itself, on which\r\nstood a small two-roomed house, serving as quarters for the British\r\nofficer on duty. From the main-guard, two gates opened into the city\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe guard on that day consisted of a detachment of the 38th Native\r\nInfantry. They had broken into mutiny, and assisted with cheers and\r\nlaughter at the spectacle of Colonel Ripley, of the 54th N.I., with\r\nother officers of that regiment, being hunted and sabred by some of the\r\nmutinous light cavalry who had arrived from Meerut. Two companies of the\r\n54th were sent hurriedly to the gate, and met the body of their colonel\r\nbeing carried out literally hacked to pieces.\r\n\r\nColonel Vibart, one of the officers of the 54th, has given in his work,\r\n“The Sepoy Mutiny,” a vivid account of the scene in the main-guard, as he\r\nentered it. In one corner lay the dead bodies of five British officers\r\nwho had just been shot. The main-guard itself was crowded with Sepoys\r\nin a mood of sullen disloyalty. Through the gate which opened on the\r\ncity could be seen the revolted cavalry troopers, in their French-grey\r\nuniforms, their swords wet with the blood of the British officers they\r\nhad just slain. A cluster of terrified English ladies—some of them widows\r\nalready, though they knew it not—had sought refuge here, and their white\r\nfaces added a note of terror to the picture.\r\n\r\nMajor Abbott, with 150 men of the 74th N.I., presently marched into the\r\nmain-guard; but the hold of the officers on the men was of the slightest,\r\nand when mutiny, in the mass of Sepoys crowded into the main-guard,\r\nwould break out into murder, nobody could guess.\r\n\r\nMajor Abbott collected the dead bodies of the fallen officers, put them\r\nin an open bullock-cart, covered them with the skirts of some ladies’\r\ndresses, and despatched the cart, with its tragic freight, to the\r\ncantonments on the Ridge. The cart found its way to the Flagstaff Tower\r\non the Ridge, and was abandoned there; and when, a month afterwards, the\r\nforce under Sir Henry Barnard marched on to the crest the cart still\r\nstood there, with the dead bodies of the unfortunate officers—by this\r\ntime turned to skeletons—in it.\r\n\r\nMatters quickly came to a crisis at the Cashmere Gate. About four o’clock\r\nin the afternoon there came in quick succession the sound of guns from\r\nthe magazine. This was followed by a deep, sullen, and prolonged blast\r\nthat shook the very walls of the main-guard itself, while up into the\r\nblue sky slowly climbed a mighty cloud of smoke. Willoughby had blown\r\nup the great powder-magazine; and the sound shook both the nerves and\r\nthe loyalty of the Sepoys who crowded the main-guard. There was kindled\r\namongst them the maddest agitation, not lessened by the sudden appearance\r\nof Willoughby and Forrest, scorched and blackened by the explosion from\r\nwhich they had in some marvellous fashion escaped.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Graves, from the Ridge, now summoned Abbott and the men of\r\nthe 74th back to that post. After some delay they commenced their march,\r\ntwo guns being sent in advance. But the first sound of their marching\r\nfeet acted as a match to the human powder-magazine. The leading files of\r\nAbbott’s men had passed through the Cashmere Gate when the Sepoys of the\r\n38th suddenly rushed at it and closed it, and commenced to fire on their\r\nofficers. In a moment the main-guard was a scene of terror and massacre.\r\nIt was filled with eddying smoke, with shouts, with the sound of\r\ncrackling muskets, of swearing men and shrieking women. Here is Colonel\r\nVibart’s description of the scene:—\r\n\r\n    The horrible truth now flashed on me—we were being massacred\r\n    right and left, without any means of escape! Scarcely knowing\r\n    what I was doing, I made for the ramp which leads from the\r\n    courtyard to the bastion above. Every one appeared to be doing\r\n    the same. Twice I was knocked over as we all frantically rushed\r\n    up the slope, the bullets whistling past us like hail, and\r\n    flattening themselves against the parapet with a frightful\r\n    hiss. To this day it is a perfect marvel to me how any one of\r\n    us escaped being hit. Poor Smith and Reveley, both of the 74th,\r\n    were killed close beside me. The latter was carrying a loaded\r\n    gun, and, raising himself with a dying effort, he discharged\r\n    both barrels into a knot of Sepoys, and the next moment expired.\r\n\r\nThe struggling crowd of British officers and ladies reached the bastion\r\nand crowded into its embrasures, while the Sepoys from the main-guard\r\nbelow took deliberate pot-shots at them. Presently a light gun was\r\nbrought to bear on the unhappy fugitives crouching on the summit of the\r\nbastion. The ditch was twenty-five feet below, but there was no choice.\r\nOne by one the officers jumped down. Some buckled their sword-belts\r\ntogether and lowered the ladies. One very stout old lady, Colonel Vibart\r\nrecords, “would neither jump down nor be lowered down; would do nothing\r\nbut scream. Just then another shot from the gun crashed into the parapet;\r\nsomebody gave the poor woman a push, and she tumbled headlong into the\r\nditch beneath.” Officers and ladies scrambled up the almost perpendicular\r\nbank which forms the farther wall of the ditch, and escaped into the\r\njungle beyond, and began their peril-haunted flight to Meerut.\r\n\r\nAbbott, of the 74th, had a less sensational escape. His men told him they\r\nhad protected him as long as they could; he must now fly for his life.\r\nAbbott resisted long, but at last said, “Very well. I’m off to Meerut;\r\nbut,” he added, with a soldier’s instinct, “give me the colours.” And,\r\ncarrying the colours of his regiment, he set off with one other officer\r\non his melancholy walk to Meerut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIEUTENANT GEORGE WILLOUGHBY, BENGAL ARTILLERY\r\n\r\n_Reproduced, by kind permission of his niece, MISS WALLACE, from a\r\nphotograph of an unfinished water-colour drawing, taken about 1857_]\r\n\r\nThe most heroic incident in Delhi that day was the defence and explosion\r\nof the great magazine. This was a huge building, standing some 600 yards\r\nfrom the Cashmere Gate, packed with munitions of war—cannon, ammunition,\r\nand rifles—sufficient to have armed half a nation, and only a handful of\r\nEnglishmen to defend it. It was in charge of Lieutenant Willoughby, who\r\nhad under him two other officers (Forrest and Raynor), four conductors\r\n(Buckley, Shaw, Scully, and Crowe), and two sergeants (Edwards and\r\nStewart); a little garrison of nine brave men, whose names deserve to be\r\nimmortalised.\r\n\r\nWilloughby was a soldier of the quiet and coolly courageous order; his\r\nmen were British soldiers of the ordinary stuff of which the rank and\r\nfile of the British Army is made. Yet no ancient story or classic fable\r\ntells of any deed of daring and self-sacrifice nobler than that which\r\nthis cluster of commonplace Englishmen was about to perform. The Three\r\nHundred who kept the pass at Thermopylae against the Persian swarms, the\r\nThree, who, according to the familiar legend, held the bridge across\r\nthe Tiber against Lars Porsena, were not of nobler fibre than the Nine\r\nwho blew up the great magazine at Delhi rather than surrender it to the\r\nmutineers.\r\n\r\nWilloughby closed and barricaded the gates, and put opposite each two\r\nsix-pounders, doubly loaded with grape; he placed a 24-pound howitzer\r\nso as to command both gates, and covered other vulnerable points with\r\nthe fire of other guns. In all he had ten pieces of artillery in\r\nposition—with only nine men to work them. He had, indeed, a score of\r\nnative officials, and he thrust arms into their reluctant hands, but\r\nknew that at the first hostile shot they would run.\r\n\r\nBut the Nine could not hope to hold the magazine finally against a city\r\nin revolt. A fuse was accordingly run into the magazine itself, some\r\nbarrels of powder were broken open, and their contents heaped on the end\r\nof the fuse. The fuse was carried into the open, and one of the party\r\n(Scully) stationed beside it, lighted port-fire in hand. Willoughby’s\r\nplan was to hold the magazine as long as he could work the guns. But\r\nwhen, as was inevitable, the wave of mutinous Sepoys swept over the\r\nwalls, Willoughby was to give the signal by a wave of his hat, Scully\r\nwould instantly light the fuse, and the magazine—with its stores of\r\nwarlike material, its handful of brave defenders, and its swarm of eager\r\nassailants—would vanish in one huge thunderclap!\r\n\r\nPresently there came a formal summons in the name of the King of Delhi\r\nto surrender the magazine. The summons met with a grim and curt refusal.\r\nNow the Sepoys came in solid columns down the narrow streets, swung\r\nround the magazine, and girdled it with shouts and a tempest of bullets.\r\nThe native defenders, at the first shot, clambered down the walls and\r\nvanished, and the forlorn but gallant Nine were left alone. Hammers were\r\nbeating fiercely on the gates. A score of improvised scaling-ladders were\r\nplaced against the walls, and in a moment the Sepoys were swarming up. A\r\ngate was burst open, but, as the assailants tried to rush in, a blast of\r\ngrape swept through them. Willoughby’s nine guns, each worked by a single\r\ngunner, poured their thunder of sound, and storm of shot, swiftly and\r\nsteadily, on the swaying mass of Sepoys that blocked the gate.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Forrest, who survived the perils of that fierce hour, has\r\ntold, in cool and soldierly language, its story:—\r\n\r\n    Buckley, assisted only by myself, loaded and fired in rapid\r\n    succession the several guns above detailed, firing at least\r\n    four rounds from each gun, and with the same steadiness as if\r\n    standing on parade, although the enemy were then some hundreds\r\n    in number, and kept up a hot fire of musketry on us within\r\n    forty or fifty yards. After firing the last round, Buckley\r\n    received a musket ball in his arm above the elbow; I, at the\r\n    same time, was struck in the left hand by two musket balls.\r\n\r\nWhen, before or since, has there been a contest so heroic or so hopeless?\r\nBut what can Nine do against twice as many hundreds? From the summit\r\nof the walls a deadly fire is concentrated on the handful of gallant\r\nBritish. One after another drops. In another moment will come the\r\nrush of the bayonets. Willoughby looks round and sees Scully stooping\r\nwith lighted port-fire over the fuse, and watching for the agreed\r\nsignal. He lifts his hand. Coolly and swiftly Scully touches the fuse\r\nwith his port-fire. The red spark runs along its centre; there is an\r\nearth-shaking crash, as of thunder, a sky-piercing leap of flame. The\r\nwalls of the magazine are torn asunder; bodies of men and fragments\r\nof splintered arms fly aloft. The whole city seems to shake with the\r\nconcussion, and a great pillar of smoke, mushroom-topped and huge, rises\r\nslowly in the sky. It is the signal to heaven and earth of how the Nine\r\nBritish, who kept the great magazine, had fulfilled their trust.\r\n\r\nOf those gallant Nine, Scully, who fired the train, and four others\r\nvanished, along with hundreds of the mutineers, in one red rain. But,\r\nsomehow, they themselves scarcely knew how, Willoughby, with his two\r\nofficers, and Conductor Buckley found themselves, smoke-blackened and\r\ndazed, outside the magazine, and they escaped death, for the moment at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nThe fugitives who escaped from the Cashmere Gate had some very tragical\r\nexperiences. Sinking from fatigue and hunger, scorched by the flame-like\r\nheat of the sun, wading rivers, toiling through jungles, hunted by\r\nvillagers, they struggled on, seeking some place of refuge. Some reached\r\nMeerut, others Umballa, but many died. Of that much-enduring company of\r\nfugitives, it is recorded that the women often showed the highest degree\r\nof fortitude and patience. Yet more than one mother had to lay her child,\r\nkilled by mere exposure or heat, in a nameless jungle grave; more than\r\none wife had to see her husband die, of bullet or sword-stroke, at her\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nBut the fate of these wanderers was happier than that of the Europeans\r\nleft in the city. Some twenty-seven—eleven of them being children and\r\neight women—took refuge in a house near the great mosque. They held the\r\nhouse for three days, but, having no water, suffered all the agonies of\r\nthirst. The Sepoys set vessels of water in front of the house, and bade\r\nthe poor besieged give up their arms and they should drink. They yielded,\r\ngave up the two miserable guns with which they had defended themselves,\r\nand were led out. No water was given them. Death alone was to cool those\r\nfever-blackened lips. They were set in a row, the eleven children and\r\nsixteen men and women, and shot. Let tender-hearted mothers picture that\r\nscene, transacted under the white glare of the Indian sun!\r\n\r\nSome fifty Europeans and Eurasians barricaded themselves in a strong\r\nhouse in the English quarter of the city. The house was stormed, the\r\nunhappy captives were dragged to the King of Delhi’s palace, and thrust\r\ninto an underground cellar, with no windows and only one door. For five\r\ndays they sweltered and sickened in that black hole. Then they were\r\nbrought out, with one huge rope girdling them—men, women, and children,\r\na pale-faced, haggard, half-naked crowd, crouching under one of the\r\ngreat trees in the palace garden. About them gathered a brutal mob of\r\nSepoys and Budmashes, amongst whom was Abool Bukr, the heir-apparent to\r\nthe King of Delhi. The whole of the victims were murdered, with every\r\naccompaniment of cruelty, and it is said that the heir-apparent himself\r\ndevised horrible refinements of suffering.\r\n\r\nLess than six months afterwards Hodson, of Hodson’s Horse, shot that\r\nprincely murderer, with a cluster of his kinsfolk, under the walls\r\nof Delhi, and in the presence of some 6000 shuddering natives, first\r\nexplaining, that they were the murderers of women and children. Their\r\nbodies were brought in a cart through the most public street of the city,\r\nlaid side by side, under the tree and on the very spot where they had\r\ntortured and murdered our women.\r\n\r\nMutiny grows swiftly. On Sunday night was fired, from the ranks of the\r\n20th Sepoys, the volley that slew Colonel Finnis, and was, so to speak,\r\nthe opening note in the long miserere of the Mutiny. At four o’clock on\r\nMonday afternoon the thunder of the great magazine, as it exploded, shook\r\nthe walls of Delhi. Before the grey light of Tuesday morning broke over\r\nthe royal city every member of the British race in it was either slain or\r\na captive.\r\n\r\nWhen a powder-magazine is fired, the interval of time between the flash\r\nof the first ignited grain and the full-throated blast of the explosion\r\nis scarcely measurable. And if the cluster of keen and plotting brains\r\nbehind the Great Mutiny had carried out their plans as they intended,\r\nthe Mutiny would have had exactly this bewildering suddenness of\r\narrival. There is what seems ample evidence to prove that Sunday, May\r\n31, was fixed for the simultaneous rising of all the Sepoy regiments in\r\nBengal. A small committee of conspirators was at work in each regiment,\r\nelaborating the details of the Mutiny. Parties were to be told off in\r\neach cantonment, to murder the British officers and their families while\r\nin church, to seize the treasury, release the prisoners, and capture the\r\nguns. The Sepoy regiments in Delhi were to take possession of that great\r\ncity, with its arsenal.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak at Meerut not merely altered the date, it changed the\r\ncharacter of the revolt. The powder-magazine exploded, so to speak,\r\nin separate patches, and at intervals spread over weeks. It was this\r\ncircumstance—added to the fact that the Sepoys had rejected the greased\r\ncartridges, and with them the Enfield rifle, against which Brown Bess was\r\nat a fatal disadvantage—that, speaking humanly, robbed the Mutiny of half\r\nits terror, and helped to save the British Empire in India.\r\n\r\nBut, even allowing for all this, a powder-magazine—although it explodes\r\nonly by instalments—is a highly uncomfortable residence while the\r\nexplosion is going on; and seldom before or since, in the long stretch of\r\nhuman history, have human courage and fortitude been put to such a test,\r\nas in the case of the handful of British soldiers and civilians who held\r\nthe North-West Provinces for England during the last days of May 1857.\r\n\r\nSir George Campbell, who was in Simla at the time, has told the story of\r\nhow he stood one day, early in June, beside the telegraph operator in\r\nUmballa, and listened while the wire, to use his own words, “seemed to\r\nrepeat the experience of Job.” “First we heard that the whole Jullunder\r\nbrigade had mutinied, and were in full march in our direction, on the\r\nway to Delhi. While that message was still being spoken, came another\r\nmessage, to tell us that the troops in Rajpootana had mutinied, and that\r\nRohilcund was lost; following which, I heard that the Moradabad regiment\r\nhad gone, and that my brother and his young wife had been obliged to fly.”\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered that the revolted districts equal in area France,\r\nAustria, and Prussia put together; in population they exceeded them.\r\nAnd over this great area, and through this huge population, the process\r\ndescribed by the telegrams, to whose rueful syllables Sir George Campbell\r\nlistened, was being swiftly and incessantly repeated. The British troops\r\ndid not number 22,000 men, and they were scattered over a hundred\r\nmilitary stations, and submerged in a population of 94,000,000. Let\r\nthe reader imagine fifteen or sixteen British regiments sprinkled in\r\nmicroscopic fragments over an area so vast, and amongst populations so\r\nhuge!\r\n\r\nThe Sepoy army in Bengal numbered 150,000 men, and within six weeks of\r\nthe shot which killed Colonel Finnis at Meerut, of its 120 regiments\r\nof horse and foot, only twenty-five remained under the British flag,\r\nand not five of these could be depended upon! A whole army, in a word,\r\nmagnificently drilled, perfectly officered, strong in cavalry, and yet\r\nmore formidable in guns, was in open and murderous revolt. Some idea of\r\nthe scale and completeness of the Mutiny can be gathered from the single\r\nfact that every regiment of regular cavalry, ten regiments of irregular\r\ncavalry out of eighteen, and sixty-three out of seventy-four regiments of\r\ninfantry, then on the strength of the Bengal army, disappeared finally\r\nand completely from its roster!\r\n\r\nIn each cantonment during the days preceding the revolt, the British\r\nofficers on the spot were—to return to our figure—like men shut up in a\r\npowder-magazine with the train fired. There might be a dozen or twenty\r\nBritish officers with their families at a station held by a battery of\r\nnative artillery, a couple of squadrons of native horse, and a regiment\r\nof native infantry—all plotting revolt and murder! Honour forbade the\r\nBritish to fly. To show a sign of mistrust or take a single visible\r\nprecaution would be to precipitate the outbreak. Many of the old Bengal\r\nofficers relied on their Sepoys, with a fond credulity that nothing could\r\nalarm, and that made them blind and deaf to the facts about them. “It\r\nwas not,” says Trevelyan, “till he saw his own house in flames, and\r\nnot till he looked down the barrels of Sepoy muskets, and heard Sepoy\r\nbullets whizzing round his ears, that an old Bengal officer could begin\r\nto believe that his men were not as staunch as they ought to be.”\r\n\r\nBut all officers were not so blind as this. They knew their peril. They\r\nsaw the tragedy coming. They walked day after day in front of the line of\r\ntheir men’s muskets on parade, not knowing when these iron tubes would\r\nbreak into red flame and flying bullets. They lay down night after night,\r\nknowing that the Sepoys in every hut were discussing the exact manner\r\nand time of their murder. Yet each man kept an untroubled brow, and went\r\npatiently the round of his duty, thanking God when he had no wife and\r\nchild at the station to fall under the tender mercies of the mutineers.\r\nFarquhar, of the 7th Light Cavalry, writing to his mother at the time,\r\nsaid, “I slept every night dressed, with my revolver under my pillow, a\r\ndrawn sword on my bed, and a loaded double-barrelled gun just under my\r\nbed. We remained in this jolly state,” he explained, “a fortnight.”\r\n\r\nWhen the outbreak came, and the bungalows were in flames, and the men\r\nwere shouting and firing on the parade-ground, it was a point of honour\r\namong the officers to hurry to the scene and make one last appeal to\r\nthem, dying too often under the bullets of their own soldiers. The\r\nsurvivors then had to fly, with their women and children, and hide\r\nin the hot jungle or wander over the scorching plains, on which the\r\nwhite heat burns like a flame, suffering all the torments of thirst and\r\nweariness, of undressed wounds, and of wearing fever. If some great\r\nwriter, with full knowledge and a pen of fire, could write the story of\r\nwhat was dared and suffered by Englishmen and Englishwomen at a hundred\r\nscattered posts throughout the North-West Provinces, in the early stages\r\nof the Mutiny, it would be one of the most moving and heroic tales in\r\nhuman records.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Fayrer tells how, early in 1857, he was a member of a\r\ntiger-shooting expedition into the Terai. It was a merry party, and\r\nincluded some famous shots and great civil officials. They had killed\r\ntheir eleventh tiger when the first news of the rising reached the party.\r\n“All my companions,” says Fayrer, “except Gubbins, were victims of the\r\nMutiny during the year. Thomason was murdered at Shah Jehanpore; Gonne in\r\nthe Mullahpore district; Colonel Fischer was killed by the men of his own\r\nregiment; Thornhill was murdered at Seetapore; Lester was shot through\r\nthe neck during the siege of Lucknow; Graydon was killed after the first\r\nrelief of Lucknow.” Swift-following deaths of this sort have to be\r\nmultiplied over the whole area of the Mutiny, before we can realise what\r\nit cost in life.\r\n\r\nFayrer, as a single example of the sort of tragedies which took place on\r\nevery side, tells how his brother, who was an officer in a regiment of\r\nirregular cavalry, was killed. He was second in command of a detachment\r\nsupposed to be of loyalty beyond suspicion. It had been sent by Lawrence\r\nfrom Lucknow to maintain order in the unsettled districts. There was\r\nno sign that the men intended to rise. The morning bugle had gone, the\r\ntroop was ready to start, and young Fayrer, who had gone out, walked to\r\na well with his charger’s bridle over his arm, and was drinking water\r\nfrom a cup. Suddenly one of his own troopers came up behind him and cut\r\nhim down through the back of the neck with his tulwar. “The poor lad—only\r\ntwenty-three—fell dead on the spot, gasping out the word ‘mother’ as he\r\nfell.” The troopers instantly rode at the three other British officers\r\nof the detachment. One of these slew three Sepoys before he was killed\r\nhimself; the second, ill mounted, was overtaken and slain; the third, a\r\nsplendid rider, made a reckless leap over a nullah, where his pursuers\r\ndared not follow, and so escaped.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the great drama at Cawnpore, or Lucknow, or Delhi, it\r\nis worth while to give, if only as hasty vignettes, some pictures of what\r\nhappened at many of the stations scattered through Oude and the Punjaub.\r\nThey are the opening episodes of a stupendous tragedy.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Herbert Edwardes, it was the act of an English boy that\r\nsaved the Punjaub. A very youthful operator—a mere lad—named Brendish,\r\nwas by some accident alone in the Delhi Telegraph Office. When the\r\nMutiny broke out he had to flee like the rest; but, before leaving, he\r\nwired a somewhat incoherent message to Umballa. “We must leave office,”\r\nit ran; “all the bungalows are on fire, burning down by the Sepoys of\r\nMeerut. They came in this morning.... Nine Europeans are killed.” That\r\nmessage reached Umballa, was sent on to Lahore, and was read there as\r\na danger-signal so expressive, that the authorities at once decided\r\nto disarm the native troops at that station. The cryptic message was\r\nthen flashed on to Peshawur, and was there read in the same sense, and\r\nacted upon with the same promptitude. Brendish was one of the few who\r\nafterwards escaped from Delhi.\r\n\r\nAt some of the stations, where cool heads and steadfast courage\r\nprevailed, the Sepoys were disarmed with swiftness and decision. This\r\nwas especially the case in the Punjaub, where the cause of England was\r\nupheld by the kingly brain of John Lawrence, the swift decision of\r\nHerbert Edwardes, and the iron courage of Neville Chamberlain and of John\r\nNicholson.\r\n\r\nLord Roberts has told how, on May 12, he was present as scribe at a\r\ncouncil of war held in Peshawur. Round the table sat a cluster of gallant\r\nsoldiers, such as might well take charge of the fortunes of a nation in\r\nthe hour of its deadliest peril. Herbert Edwardes was there, and Neville\r\nChamberlain, and Nicholson. They had to consider how to hold the Punjaub\r\nquiet while all Bengal was in a flame of mutiny. The Punjaub was a newly\r\nconquered province; its warlike population might well be expected to\r\nseize the first opportunity of rising against its conquerors. It was\r\nheld by an army of over 80,000 troops, and of these only 15,000 were\r\nBritish—the rest, some 65,000, were almost sure to join the Mutiny. For\r\nevery British soldier in the Punjaub, that is, there were four probable\r\nmutineers, while behind these was a warlike population, just subdued by\r\nthe sword, and ready to rise again.\r\n\r\nBut the cool heads that met in that council were equal to their task.\r\nIt was resolved to disarm all doubtful regiments, and raise new forces\r\nin their stead in the Punjaub itself, and from its wild frontier clans.\r\nA movable column, light-footed, hard-hitting, was to be formed under\r\nNeville Chamberlain’s command, with which to smite at revolt whenever it\r\nlifted its head. So the famous Movable Column came into being, commanded\r\nin turn by Chamberlain and by Nicholson. That column itself had to be\r\npurged heroically again and again to cleanse it from mutinous elements,\r\ntill it practically came to consist of one field-battery, one troop of\r\nhorse-artillery, and one infantry regiment, all British. Then it played a\r\ngreat part in the wild scenes of the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nBefore new levies could be raised in the Punjaub, however, the English\r\nhad to give some striking proof of decision and strength. No Indian race\r\nwill fight for masters who do not show some faculty for command. The\r\ncrisis came at Peshawur itself, towards the end of May. The Sepoys had\r\nfixed May 22 for rising against their officers. On the 21st the 64th\r\nNative Infantry was to march into Peshawur, and on the following morning\r\nthe revolt was to take place. Herbert Edwardes and Nicholson, however,\r\nwere the last men in the world to be caught off their guard. At 7 A.M.\r\non the morning of the 21st, parade was held, and, as the result of some\r\nclever manœuvres, the five native regiments found themselves confronted\r\nby a line of British muskets, and ordered to “pile arms.” The intending\r\nmutineers were reduced, almost with a gesture, to the condition of an\r\nunarmed mob, and that lightning-stroke of decision saved the Punjaub.\r\nLevies poured in; new regiments rose like magic; a loyal army became\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nLittle more than a fortnight afterwards, Neville Chamberlain discovered\r\na plot in the 35th Native Infantry, and promptly blew two ringleaders\r\nfrom the guns, the first instance of that dramatic form of punishment in\r\nthe Mutiny. Later, when Nicholson took command of the Movable Column, he\r\nwas compelled to disarm two native regiments, the 35th and the 33rd. The\r\n33rd was on its march to join the column, and Nicholson conducted the\r\nbusiness with so nice an adjustment of time and method that the 35th had\r\nbeen disarmed, and their muskets and belts packed in carts and sent off\r\nto the fort, just as the 33rd marched up. As it halted it found itself,\r\nnot side by side with a regiment of accomplices, but in front of a long\r\nand menacing line of British infantry and guns, and Roberts himself rode\r\nforward with the order to its colonel to pile arms. “What! disarm my\r\nregiment?” said that astonished officer, who was serenely unconscious\r\nthat there was a mutinous brain under every shako in his regiment. When\r\nthe order was repeated, the old colonel broke into actual tears. But\r\nthere were sterner wills and stronger brains than his in command, and the\r\n33rd was, in turn, reduced to harmlessness.\r\n\r\nAt Lahore, again, the Sepoys had an elaborate plot to kill their\r\nofficers, overpower the European troops, and seize the treasury and the\r\nguns. Lahore was a city of 90,000 inhabitants, with a garrison of 2500\r\nSepoys in the city itself. The city troops were to rise first, and their\r\nsuccess was to be signalled to Meanmeer, the military cantonment, six\r\nmiles distant. Mutiny at Lahore was to be followed by revolt through all\r\nthe military stations of the district, from the Rabee to the Sutlej.\r\nThe plot, however, was discovered. General Corbett, a cool and gallant\r\nsoldier, resolved to disarm the whole native garrison.\r\n\r\nOn the night of May 12, three days before the date fixed for the Mutiny,\r\na military ball was to be held. This arrangement was not changed, lest\r\nthe suspicions of the Sepoys should be aroused, and dancing was kept up\r\ntill two o’clock in the morning. Then the officers at grey dawn hurried\r\nto the parade-ground, where, by instructions issued the day before,\r\nthe whole brigade was assembled, nominally to hear some general orders\r\nread. These were read in the usual fashion at the head of each regiment.\r\nThen some brigade manœuvres followed, and these were so adroitly\r\narranged that, at their close, the native regiments found themselves in\r\nquarter-distance column, with five companies of a British regiment, the\r\n81st, opposite them in line, the guns being still in the rear of the 81st.\r\n\r\nIn a single sentence, brief and stern, the order was given for the native\r\nregiments to “pile arms.” The Grenadiers of the 16th, to whom the order\r\nwas first addressed, hesitated; the men began to handle their arms; for\r\none breathless moment it was doubtful whether they would obey or fight.\r\nBut simultaneously with the words “pile arms,” the 81st had fallen back,\r\ncoolly and swiftly, between the guns, and the Sepoys, almost at a breath,\r\nfound themselves covered by a battery of twelve pieces loaded with grape,\r\nthe artillerymen standing in position with burning port-fires, whilst\r\nalong the line of the 81st behind ran the stern order, “Load,” and\r\nalready the click of the ramrods in the muskets was heard.\r\n\r\nThe nerve of the Sepoys failed! Sullenly they piled arms, and 600\r\nEnglish, by adroitness and daring, disarmed 2500 Sepoys without a shot!\r\nWhat five minutes before had been a menace to the British power was made\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\nMontgomery, the chief civil officer at Lahore, divides with Corbett the\r\nhonour of the brilliant stroke of soldiership which saved the city.\r\nNever was there a less heroic figure in outward appearance than that\r\nof Montgomery. He was short, stout, soft-spoken, rubicund-faced, and\r\nbore, indeed, a ludicrous resemblance to Mr. Pickwick as depicted by the\r\nhumorous pencil of “Phiz.” He was familiarly known, as a matter of fact,\r\nto all Englishmen in his province by the sobriquet of “Pickwick.” But\r\nnature sometimes conceals an heroic spirit within a very unheroic-looking\r\nbody. If in outward look there was something sheep-like in Montgomery’s\r\nappearance, there was a lion-like strain in his courage. He had only a\r\nhint of the coming storm. A couple of scanty telegrams brought in the\r\nnews of the mutiny at Meerut and the seizure of Delhi. With quick vision\r\nMontgomery read the temper of the native troops at Meanmeer, and, with\r\nswifter decision than even that of Corbett, he advised that they should\r\nbe instantly disarmed. That decision averted a great disaster.\r\n\r\nThe whole story shows what is possible to clear judgment and resolute\r\ncourage; but where these failed, or where some old Bengal officer\r\nretained his blind and fond credulity as to the “staunchness” of his\r\nmen, then great tragedies became possible.\r\n\r\nThus at Futteghur, some seventy miles from Cawnpore, the 10th Native\r\nInfantry, with some irregular troops, held the cantonments. General\r\nGoldie was divisional commander; Colonel Smith held command of the 10th,\r\nand cherished a piously confident belief in the loyalty of his Sepoys.\r\nThe civilians, with a shrewder insight into the state of affairs,\r\nbelieved mutiny certain, and murder highly probable, and determined\r\nto leave the station. On June 4 a little fleet of boats, laden with\r\nalmost the entire English colony in the place—merchants, shopkeepers,\r\nmissionaries, with their wives and children—started down the river, to\r\nthe huge disgust of Colonel Smith, who thought their departure a libel\r\non his beloved Sepoys. Part of the company found refuge with a friendly\r\nZemindar, while three boats, containing nearly seventy persons—of whom\r\nforty-nine were women and children—pushed on to Cawnpore. In Cawnpore,\r\nhowever, though they were in ignorance of the fact, Wheeler and his\r\ngallant few were already fighting for life against overwhelming odds.\r\n\r\nNews soon reached the Sepoy lines at Cawnpore that three boat-loads\r\nof Sahibs were on the river, and a rush was made for them. The poor\r\nvictims had pulled in to the bank and were enjoying “afternoon tea” when\r\nthe horde of mutineers burst upon them. Some tried to hide in the long\r\ngrass, which was set on fire above them. The rest, scorched, wounded,\r\nhalf-naked, with bleeding feet—mothers trying to shelter or carry their\r\nchildren—were dragged to the presence of Nana Sahib. The ladies and\r\nchildren were ordered to sit on the ground; their husbands, with their\r\nhands tied, were arranged in careful order behind them. Being thus\r\npicturesquely arranged for easy murder, some files of the 2nd Cavalry\r\nwere marched up to kill the whole. The process was lengthy, wives\r\nclinging to their husbands, mothers trying to shelter their little ones\r\nwith their own bodies from the keen cavalry swords. Nana Sahib watched\r\nthe whole process with the leisurely and discriminating interest of a\r\nconnoisseur.\r\n\r\nOn June 18 Colonel Smith’s trusted Sepoys broke into open revolt at\r\nthe station, whence these poor fugitives had fled. The little British\r\ngarrison, consisting of thirty fighting men, with sixty ladies and\r\nchildren, took refuge in a low mud fort, and held it for nearly three\r\nweeks. Then they fought their way to their boats and fled. They were\r\nfiercely pursued. One boat grounded, and its miserable passengers were\r\nsummarily murdered. Death by bullets, by sunstroke, by drowning, pursued\r\nthe rest. One boat-load escaped, but escaped only to reach Cawnpore, and\r\nto perish amid the horrors of the slaughter-house there.\r\n\r\nOne survivor has left a record of that dreadful voyage. He was in the\r\nboat that first grounded and was boarded by the Sepoys. He describes\r\nhow the passengers were shot, and how “Major Robertson, seeing no hope,\r\nbegged the ladies to come into the water rather than fall into their\r\nhands. While the ladies were throwing themselves into the water I\r\njumped into the boat, took up a loaded musket, and, going astern, shot\r\na Sepoy.... Mr. and Mrs. Fisher were about twenty yards from the boat;\r\nhe had his child in his arms, apparently lifeless. Mrs. Fisher could not\r\nstand against the current; her dress, which acted like a sail, knocked\r\nher down, when she was helped up by Mr. Fisher.... Early the next morning\r\na voice hailed us from the shore, which we recognised as Mr. Fisher’s.\r\nHe came on board, and informed us that his poor wife and child had been\r\ndrowned in his arms.”\r\n\r\nFor skill, daring, and promptitude, nothing exceeded the fashion in which\r\nthe incipient mutiny at Multan was trampled out. At no other post were\r\nthe conditions more perilous. The garrison consisted of a troop of native\r\nhorse-artillery, two regiments of native infantry, and the 1st Irregular\r\nCavalry; the only English troops were 50 artillerymen in charge of the\r\nmagazine. Here, then, were 50 British artillerymen, without guns, opposed\r\nto over 3000 Sepoys—horse, foot, and artillery!\r\n\r\nThe decisive factor in the problem was the character of the British\r\ncommander, Major Chamberlain. His strong will and genius for command\r\nheld the 1st Irregular Cavalry steady. They were Hindus from the\r\nneighbourhood of Delhi, with a full measure of the superstition and pride\r\nof caste which swept away other regiments. But they believed in their\r\ncommander. He swayed their imaginations as with a touch of magic. The\r\nspell of his looks and voice, his imperious will, overbore the impulse to\r\nrevolt. His men declared they would follow him to the death! Chamberlain\r\nresolved to disarm the other native regiments, and he performed the\r\nperilous feat, not only with miraculous audacity, but with a miraculous\r\nnicety of arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd Punjaub Infantry and the 1st Punjaub Cavalry were to arrive at\r\nthe station on a given day. They were native troops, but could—for the\r\nmoment at least—be trusted. The new troops came in at nightfall. At 4\r\nA.M. the next morning the two Sepoy regiments and a troop of native\r\nartillery were marched out as if for an ordinary parade. They were\r\nsuddenly halted; the Punjaub troops quietly marched betwixt them and\r\ntheir lines; the fifty English gunners took their places beside the guns\r\nof the native artillery, and a little band of Sikh cavalry that could be\r\ntrusted rode up to the flank of the guns.\r\n\r\nThen Chamberlain gave the order to the suspected regiments to “pile\r\narms.” One Sepoy shouted, “Don’t give up your arms! Fight for them;” but\r\nhis English adjutant instantly grasped him by the throat, shook him as\r\na terrier would shake a rat, and flung him on the ground. The mutinous\r\nSepoys hesitated; their courage sank; they meekly piled arms, were\r\nmarched back weaponless to their barracks, and the station was saved. But\r\nit was a great feat to disarm a whole garrison with only fifty English\r\ngunners. The regiment of irregular cavalry was permanently saved by the\r\nspell of Chamberlain’s authority, and, as a reward, is still the 1st\r\nRegiment of Bengal Cavalry.\r\n\r\nSome of the revolting regiments, it is satisfactory to know, had very\r\ndistressful experiences. They found that mutiny was a bad investment.\r\nLet the tale of the 55th, for example, be told. The regiment broke into\r\nopen mutiny at Mardan on May 22, fired on their officers, and marched\r\noff to the hills with the regimental colours and treasure. Its colonel,\r\nSpottiswoode, blew out his brains in mingled grief and despair when he\r\nsaw his “faithful” Sepoys in open revolt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the most menacing figure in all the great drama of the\r\nMutiny—that of Nicholson—made its appearance on the track of the\r\nmutineers. Nicholson overtook them on the 24th, after a ride of seventy\r\nmiles, slew 150, captured another 150 with the stolen colours, and\r\npromptly executed forty of his prisoners by blowing them from his guns.\r\nThe rest of the broken regiment crossed the border, were hunted down\r\nby the hill-tribes, fell into the hands of Mohammedan fanatics, were\r\n“converted” by the argument of whip and sword, or were sold as slaves.\r\n“One fat old subahdar,” says Mr. Cave-Browne, “was sold for four annas\r\n(sixpence)”! Mutiny, it is clear, proved a very bitter experience for\r\nthe unhappy 55th! The legend that has grown round the wanderings of this\r\nbroken regiment is told by Mr. Rudyard Kipling in his vivid story, “The\r\nLost Legion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSTAMPING OUT MUTINY\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most characteristic story of Sepoy outbreak is that at\r\nAllahabad. The city stands at the junction of the Ganges and the Jumna,\r\n500 miles from Calcutta, and, with its strong fortress and great arsenal,\r\nwas a strategic point scarcely second in importance to Delhi. It had a\r\npopulation of 75,000, highly fanatical in temper. Its arsenal was one\r\nof the largest in India, having arms for 40,000 men and great stores\r\nof artillery. Yet, with the exception of the magazine staff, there was\r\nnot a British soldier in the city! It was garrisoned by the 6th Native\r\nInfantry, a wing of a Sikh regiment, the 9th, a battery of native\r\nartillery, and some native cavalry.\r\n\r\nColonel Simpson of the 6th, who was in command, cherished the most\r\nenthusiastic faith in his men. He looked on his cherished Sepoys as\r\na regiment of mere dusky-skinned Sir Galahads; each one of them was\r\nas faithful as Milton’s Abdiel! Some sixty superannuated British\r\nartillerymen, the youngest of them over fifty years of age, had been\r\nthrown hurriedly into the fort itself as a garrison; and Colonel Simpson\r\nstrongly urged that his regiment should be taken into the fort in their\r\nplace as “a proof of confidence.” This would have been like putting a\r\ncommittee of wolves inside the fold!\r\n\r\nAt evening parade on June 6, Colonel Simpson read to his Sepoys the\r\nformal thanks of the Governor-General for their virtuous offer to go out\r\nand fight the wicked mutineers at Delhi. He added a glowing eulogium of\r\ntheir loyalty on his own account. The Sepoys cheered, Colonel Simpson and\r\nhis fellow-officers adjourned to the mess-room, and no doubt discoursed\r\nwith great comfort on the much-enduring fidelity of their men. Within\r\nfour hours of being thanked by Lord Canning and praised by Colonel\r\nSimpson, the “faithful” Sepoys of the 6th Infantry had murdered seventeen\r\nofficers and all the women and children of English blood they could\r\ncapture, and were in full march to Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe tale is typical. At nine o’clock a bugle call sounded from the\r\nlines—it was the signal for revolt. The men rushed to arms. The Sepoy\r\nartillerymen holding the bridge swung their guns round, and opened fire\r\non their officers. Harward and Alexander, in command of the Native\r\nIrregular Horse, and both officers of great promise, leaped into their\r\nsaddles, and galloped fiercely to the bridge to recapture the guns. When\r\nthey gave the order to charge, their treacherous followers suddenly\r\npulled up; and, followed by only three troopers, the officers rode at\r\nthe guns. Alexander, rising in his stirrups for one gallant sword-stroke,\r\nwas shot through the heart; and Harward had to gallop for his life.\r\n\r\nSimpson and his officers in the meanwhile ran to the parade-ground to\r\n“expostulate” with their men. Five officers were instantly shot down.\r\nColonel Simpson was beginning to address a new series of compliments\r\nto his faithful Sepoys, but they turned their muskets upon him, and\r\ninterrupted his eloquence with a volley. By some miracle he escaped and\r\ngalloped off to the fort. He had to ride past the mess-house, and the\r\nmess guard turned out and took pot shots at him as he rode. The unhappy\r\ncolonel reached the gate of the fort with a dying horse, a wounded arm,\r\nand an entirely new theory of Sepoy loyalty.\r\n\r\nBut was the fort itself safe? Its garrison consisted of the sixty odd\r\nsuperannuated artillerymen, a few civilian volunteers, the wing of a\r\nSikh regiment, and a company of the 9th Native Infantry. These men held\r\nthe gate, and were, of course, only waiting to open it to their revolted\r\ncomrades. If the Sikhs joined hands with them, there remained nothing\r\nbut hopeless massacre for the British. And only five days before, at\r\nBenares, it must be remembered, a Sikh regiment had opened fire on its\r\nofficers! As a matter of fact, the Sikhs in the fort were effervescing\r\nwith excitement. Mutiny was in the air. Upon whom the Sikh muskets might\r\nbe turned, their owners themselves scarcely knew. It was a crisis of the\r\nsort which overwhelms weak men, but gives a man of heroic will a supreme\r\nopportunity. And, fortunately, a man with all the decision and courage\r\nthe moment needed was on the spot.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Brasyer had fought as a private in the ranks through the\r\nSutlej campaigns, and won a commission by his coolness and daring. He\r\npossessed exactly the genius needed for commanding irregular soldiery. He\r\nwas an athlete, a fine swordsman, a man of the swiftest decision and most\r\ngallant courage. He is not unworthy, indeed, to be ranked for leadership\r\nand personal daring with Hodson of “Hodson’s Horse.” Brasyer had first to\r\nmaster his Sikhs, trembling on the verge of revolt themselves. Archibald\r\nForbes has described his method: “Standing over the magazine with a\r\nred-hot iron in his hand, he swore by Nanac, Ram Das, Govind, and all\r\nother Gooroos of the Sikhs, that if his men did not promptly fall in and\r\nobey his orders he would blow the regiment to the Sikh equivalent of\r\nHades.”\r\n\r\nBrasyer’s glance and voice, his imperious will and daring, mastered\r\nthe Sikhs, and they fell obediently into rank. He instantly marched\r\nthem down, with loaded muskets, to the gate, and, with the help of the\r\nartillerymen with their port-fires, drove out the company of Sepoys that\r\nheld it, and the fort was saved! But to master Sepoys in open revolt, by\r\nSikhs on the edge of revolt, was a great feat, and shows for how much,\r\nat such a crisis, one clear heroic will counts.\r\n\r\nThat night Allahabad was given up to outrage and murder. Only above the\r\nfort itself flew the flag of England, and in the fort the handful of\r\nBritish officers, determined that the great arsenal should not fall into\r\nthe hands of mutineers, were preparing to copy Willoughby’s desperate\r\nexample at Delhi. Russell, of the artillery, who was in charge of the\r\nmagazine, ran trains of powder into it, and stood ready to blow it up in\r\nthe event of capture.\r\n\r\nIn the city itself every European or Eurasian was hunted like a rat\r\nthrough the streets, and slain with every accompaniment of cruelty.\r\nOutrage, in the ordinary sense, was not, on the whole, a marked feature\r\nof the Great Mutiny. The Sepoys, that is, were on fire with cruelty\r\nrather than with lust. But their cruelty spared neither age nor sex.\r\nThe wife of a captain, according to one story current at the time—and\r\nperhaps not true—was literally boiled alive in ghee, or melted butter.\r\nChildren were tossed on bayonets, men roasted in the flames of their own\r\nbungalows; women were mutilated and dismembered. The Sepoys plundered the\r\nTreasury, carrying off some £300,000 in booty.\r\n\r\nOne detail of the Allahabad massacre peculiarly shocked the imagination\r\nof British soldiers wherever the tale was told. At the mess-table of the\r\n9th, that fatal night, there sat eight fresh-faced and boyish cadets\r\njust out from England. They had not yet joined their regiments, and\r\nmilitary life, with all its fun and excitement, lay in the glamour of the\r\nunknown before them. When the bugle rang out on the parade-ground these\r\neight unposted boy ensigns ran out with the other officers. They fell\r\ninto the hands of the mutineers, and seven had their throats cut like\r\nsheep. The eighth, a boy of sixteen, was left for dead, but survived in\r\nspite of horrible wounds for four days, hiding himself in a ravine. On\r\nthe fifth day he was discovered, dragged to the native lines, and thrust\r\ninto a hut as a prisoner.\r\n\r\nHe found there a Christian catechist, who had formerly been a Mohammedan,\r\nand who was being tortured by the Sepoys to make him renounce his\r\nfaith. The catechist’s courage had given way, but the gallant English\r\nlad—himself only sixteen years of age—urged the unhappy catechist, “Don’t\r\ndeny Christ! Never deny Christ!” Neill reached Allahabad in time to\r\nrescue both catechist and ensign. But the ensign, Arthur Cheek, died of\r\nhis wounds four days after Neill’s arrival. He had joined his regiment\r\njust eighteen days when murdered in this tragical fashion by his own men.\r\nIt may be imagined how the massacre of the “poor little griffins” moved\r\nthe British soldier to wrath everywhere.\r\n\r\nFor a few days mutiny and riot reigned supreme at Allahabad. Then, hot\r\nfrom Benares, there appeared on the scene Neill with a handful of his\r\n“Lambs,” as the Madras Fusileers, with admiring irony, were called.\r\n“Thank God, sir,” said the sentry at the gate of the fort, as Neill rode\r\nin; “you’ll save us yet!”\r\n\r\nNeill is one of the cluster of great soldiers thrust into sudden fame by\r\nthe crisis of the Mutiny, and is hardly to be judged by the standard of\r\nsmaller men and of a tamer period. He was of Scottish blood, an Ayrshire\r\nman, with a vehement fighting quality, and a strain of iron resolve,\r\nwhich had come to him, perhaps, from a line of Covenanting ancestry. He\r\nwas a veteran soldier, accustomed to govern wild clans and irregular\r\ntroops, and had held high command in the Turkish contingent in the\r\nCrimea. On the domestic side, he was, as many stern and rough-natured men\r\nare, of singular tenderness. He was strongly religious, too, though he\r\nborrowed his religion rather from the Old Testament than the New.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mutiny broke out Neill found himself in command of the Madras\r\nFusileers, a regiment which included many wild spirits in its ranks,\r\nbut which, in fighting quality, was a warlike instrument of singular\r\nefficiency. Neill and his “Lambs” were summoned from Madras by the crisis\r\nin Bengal, and Neill’s best qualities, as well as his worst—his fighting\r\nimpulse, his Scottish pride of race, the natural vehemence of his temper,\r\nhis soldierly hate of mutiny, the wrath of a strong man at outrages on\r\nwomen and children, and his fierce contempt for the feebleness shown by\r\nsome of the “arm-chair colonels” of the Bengal Army—all threw their\r\nowner into a mood in which he was prepared to dare anything to crush the\r\nMutiny and to punish the mutineers.\r\n\r\nThe Fusileers landed on the railway wharf at Calcutta, as night fell,\r\non May 23. The great city of Benares was on the verge of revolt, and\r\nNeill’s “Lambs” were to be hurried up by express to its rescue. The\r\nstation-master told Neill that unless he could get his men ashore\r\nin three minutes the train would start without them. But Neill was\r\nnot the man to allow a railway time-table to stand betwixt him and\r\nthe suppression of a mutiny. With an abrupt gesture, he put the\r\nstation-master in charge of a sergeant and a file of Fusileers. The\r\nunhappy official shouted for help, but in another second stokers,\r\nfiremen, and guard were in a row against the station wall, with a couple\r\nof “blue-caps” in charge of each. At the double the Fusileers came up the\r\nwharf, filed into the carriages, and the train, carrying the left wing of\r\nthe regiment, moved off to Raneegange; thence the detachment was carried\r\nby bullock-carts to Benares. Leaving the bulk of his men to follow, Neill\r\npushed on with the leading detachment to Benares.\r\n\r\nNowhere, perhaps, did English courage shine out with a clearer flame than\r\nat Benares. Benares is the holy city of Hinduism; it had a population of\r\n300,000, fanatical and turbulent in the highest degree. The cantonment\r\nwas held by three Sepoy regiments—all pledged to revolt—150 men of a\r\nBritish regiment, the 10th, and some thirty British gunners, with half a\r\nbattery of artillery, under the command of Olpherts. But the cluster of\r\nsoldiers and civilians responsible for the city—Tucker the commissioner,\r\nFrederick Gubbins the judge, Lind the magistrate, Ponsonby the brigadier,\r\nand Olpherts in command of the guns—held on to their post; by mere cool\r\naudacity kept the turbulent city in awe, and the mutinous Sepoys from\r\nbreaking out; and sent on to other posts in greater peril than their\r\nown such scanty reinforcements of British troops as reached them. In\r\nthe Commissioner, Tucker, at least, this heroic courage had a religious\r\nroot. “The twenty-second chapter of 2 Samuel,” he wrote to Lord Canning,\r\n“was their stand-by.” “The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my\r\ndeliverer,” is the opening verse of David’s song in that chapter; “the\r\nGod of my rock; in Him will I trust. He is my shield, and the horn of my\r\nsalvation, my high tower, and my refuge.”\r\n\r\nNeill reached the city on June 3, and found himself on the very edge of\r\na tragedy. The Sepoys had arranged for an outbreak on the night of June\r\n4. The native troops numbered over 2000; the British troops, as we have\r\nseen, consisted of 150 men of the 10th, and thirty artillerymen with\r\nthree guns. To these Neill added sixty of his “Lambs” whom he had brought\r\nwith him. Neill put the impress of his vehement will on the brigadier,\r\nPonsonby, in charge of the station, and at half-an-hour’s notice it was\r\nresolved to disarm the Sepoys.\r\n\r\nThe business was ill-managed. The Sepoys commenced to shoot, the Sikhs\r\nturned on their officers. Ponsonby, an old man, found “the sun” and\r\nthe strain of the scene too much for him, and visibly broke down. He\r\ndismounted, and Neill, who had been grimly watching the scene, said\r\nabruptly, “General, I assume command.” Ponsonby assented in silence, and\r\nNeill instantly opened on the mutineers with grape and musketry fire,\r\nand, after a few minutes’ furious shooting, Sikh and Sepoy fled. The 250,\r\nthat is, destroyed, in a military sense, the 2000!\r\n\r\nHaving stamped out the Mutiny—or, rather, scattered the mutineers—Neill\r\ndevoted the next two or three days to punishing it. The Governor-General\r\ntelegraphed orders to push on to Allahabad, but Neill believed in making\r\nthorough work, and he wired back, “Can’t move; wanted here.” And for the\r\nnext three days he kept the gallows busy, and hanged without pause or\r\npity. The Sepoys had shot down their officers, and murdered women and\r\nchildren, and Neill was bent on showing that this was a performance which\r\nbrought in its track swift and terrible punishment. “Colonel Neill’s\r\nhangings” were, no doubt, of heroic scale, and, looked at through the\r\ncold perspective of forty years, wear a very black aspect. But Neill,\r\nrightly or wrongly, held that to strike, and to strike hard, and to\r\nstrike swiftly, was the one policy in such a crisis.\r\n\r\nBenares being secure, Neill pushed on across the seventy miles of dusty,\r\nheat-scorched road to Allahabad. He started with only forty-four of his\r\n“Lambs,” and covered the seventy miles in two night marches. When they\r\nreached the Ganges, almost every fourth man was down with sunstroke,\r\nNeill himself being amongst the number, and his men only kept him up by\r\ndashing buckets of water over his head and chest. The boat pushed from\r\nthe bank; it was found to leak at a dozen points, and began to sink. The\r\n“blue-caps” relanded, and their officer, Spurgin, called for volunteers\r\nto beat the banks of the river in search of another boat.\r\n\r\nAlmost every man able to walk volunteered, and, in the heavy sand of the\r\nriver-bank, with the furnace-like heat of an Indian sun setting on fire\r\nthe very air they breathed, the Fusileers began their search for a boat\r\nto carry them across to Allahabad. More than one brave fellow fell and\r\ndied from heat and exhaustion. But a boat was found, the gallant forty\r\ncrossed, and marched—as many of them as could still keep their feet—a\r\ntiny but dauntless band, through the gates of the fort.\r\n\r\nOther detachments followed quickly, and Neill flung himself with all the\r\nfire of his Scottish blood into the task of restoring the British raj in\r\nthe great city. At daybreak he opened with his guns, from the fort, on\r\nthe suburb held by the revolted Sepoys, and then sallied out with his\r\nscanty force, and burnt it over their rebel heads. “I myself,” he wrote\r\nto his wife, “was almost dying from complete exhaustion;” but his fierce\r\nspirit overbore the fainting body that carried it. He armed a river\r\nsteamer with a howitzer and a party of volunteer riflemen, and employed\r\nit as a river patrol. He launched the fierce Sikhs—by this time heartily\r\nloyal—on the villages.\r\n\r\nThey were wild soldiers, gaunt, sinewy, and eager—the “Singh log” (“the\r\nlion people”), as they called themselves. Maude has left a graphic\r\npicture of the Sikhs who, at Allahabad, followed Brasyer as, with his\r\nflowing white beard, he led them in pursuit of the broken Sepoys, or hung\r\nwith soldierly obedience on Neill’s stern orders. “When no fighting was\r\non hand,” he says, “squads of the tall, upright, Hebraic-visaged Sikhs\r\nused to march into their commanding officer’s tent, where they stood at\r\nattention, in silence, with one hand raised at the orthodox salute. ‘What\r\ndo you want, my men?’ was the question in Hindustani. ‘May it please\r\nthe protector of the poor, we want two days’ leave.’ ‘What for?’ ‘To\r\nget drunk, Sahib!’ And their request, being considered reasonable, was\r\nusually granted!”\r\n\r\nNeill, by the way, had to use these by no means ascetic Sikhs to keep\r\nhis own “blue-caps” sober. The stocks of all the merchants in the city\r\nwere practically without owners, and the finest champagnes and brandies\r\nwere selling at 6d. per bottle. For a day or two it seemed probable that\r\nNeill’s little force would be swept out of existence in a mere ignoble\r\ntorrent of drunkenness. Neill threatened the whip and the bullet in vain;\r\nand finally marched up the Sikhs and took peremptory possession of all\r\nintoxicating drinks.\r\n\r\nOn June 18 the fighting was over, the British were masters both of fort\r\nand city, where, fourteen days before, they had been little better than\r\nprisoners or fugitives. Then was repeated, in yet sterner fashion, the\r\nretribution which had struck terror through Benares. The gallows in\r\nAllahabad groaned under its heavy and quick-following burdens. In his\r\ndiary Neill wrote: “God grant that I may have acted with justice. I know\r\nI have with severity, but, under all the circumstances, I trust for\r\nforgiveness. I have done all for the good of my country, to re-establish\r\nits prestige and power, and to put down this most barbarous and inhuman\r\ninsurrection.” Then he recites cases of outrage and mutilation on English\r\nladies and on little children, with details that still chill the natural\r\nblood with horror to read.\r\n\r\nThe Sepoys, it is to be noted, when the fighting was over, took their\r\npenalty with a sort of composed fatalism, to the Western imagination\r\nvery amazing. Sir George Campbell tells the story of the execution of an\r\nold native officer, a subhadar, which he witnessed. “He was very cool\r\nand quiet, and submitted to be executed without remonstrance. But the\r\nrope broke, and he came down to the ground. He picked himself up, and it\r\nwas rather a painful scene for the spectators. But he seemed to feel for\r\ntheir embarrassment, and thought it well to break the awkwardness of the\r\nsituation by conversation, remarking that it was a very bad rope, and\r\ntalking of little matters of that kind till another rope was procured,\r\nwhich made an end of him!”\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to write, or sing, a new and more wonderful Odyssey\r\nmade up of the valiant combats, the wild adventures, and the distressful\r\nwanderings of little groups of Englishmen and Englishwomen, upon whom the\r\ntempest of the Mutiny broke.\r\n\r\nForbes-Mitchell, for example, tells the story of Robert Tucker, the judge\r\nat Futtehpore. Tucker was a great hunter, and also, like many Indian\r\nofficials, an earnestly religious man, with an antique sense of duty.\r\nWhen the Mutiny broke out he despatched every European to Allahabad,\r\nbut refused to move himself. This solitary Englishman, in a word, was\r\ndetermined to defend Futtehpore against all comers! Believing the native\r\nofficer in charge of the police to be loyal, he sent a message to him\r\nasking him to come and make arrangements for the protection of the\r\nTreasury. This “loyal” official sent back word that the judge Sahib need\r\nnot trouble himself about the Treasury; that, in the cool of the evening,\r\nhe, with his “loyal” police, would come down and dismiss the dog of a\r\njudge himself to Hades!\r\n\r\nTucker had a hunter’s armoury—rifles, smooth-bores, and hog spears.\r\nHe loaded every barrel, barricaded every door and window, and waited\r\nquietly, reading his Bible, till, when the cool breath of evening began\r\nto stir, he saw the police and the local budmashes, with the green banner\r\nof Islam fluttering over their heads, marching down to attack him. Tucker\r\nwas offered his life on condition that he abandoned his Christianity.\r\nThen the fight broke out. For hours the musketry crackled, and was\r\nanswered by the sharp note of Tucker’s rifle. Before midnight the brave\r\njudge lay, riddled with bullets and pierced with many spear-thrusts, dead\r\non his own floor. But all round his house were strewn the bodies of those\r\nwho had fallen before his cool and deadly aim.\r\n\r\nLater on, at Kotah, a similar tragedy took place, the story of which is\r\ntold by George Lawrence. Major Burton, the Resident at Kotah, with his\r\ntwo sons—one aged twenty-one, the other a lad of sixteen—and a single\r\nnative servant, held the Residency for four hours against native troops\r\nwith artillery, and a huge crowd of rioters. The Residency was at last\r\nset on fire, and Major Burton proposed to surrender on condition that\r\nthe lives of his sons were spared. The gallant lads indignantly refused\r\nto accept the terms. They would all die together, they declared. They\r\nwere holding the roof of the Residency against their assailants, and, as\r\nLawrence tells the story, “they knelt down and prayed for the last time,\r\nand then calmly and heroically met their fate.” The mob by this time had\r\nobtained scaling-ladders. They swept over the roof, and slew the gallant\r\nthree. Major Burton’s head was cut off, paraded round the town, and then\r\nfired from a gun.\r\n\r\nOne of the most surprising of these personal adventures was that which\r\novertook the Deputy Commissioner of Delhi, Sir T. Metcalfe. Wilberforce,\r\nin his “Unrecorded Chapter of the Indian Mutiny,” tells the tale, and\r\nsays he heard it twice over from Sir T. Metcalfe’s own lips—though\r\nWilberforce’s stories sometimes are vehemently suspected to belong to the\r\nrealm of fiction rather than of sober history. His account of Metcalfe’s\r\nadventure, however, is at least _ben trovato_.\r\n\r\nMetcalfe escaped from Delhi on horseback, hotly pursued by some native\r\ncavalry. His horse broke down, and in despair Metcalfe appealed to a\r\nfriendly-looking native to conceal him from his pursuers. The man led\r\nhim to a cave, told him he would save him if possible, and, striking his\r\nhorse on the flank, sent it galloping down the road, while Metcalfe\r\ncrept through the black throat of the cave into concealment. Presently\r\nMetcalfe heard his pursuers ride up, fiercely question his protector, and\r\nfinally propose to search the cave.\r\n\r\n    On this my friend burst out laughing, and, raising his voice so\r\n    that I must hear, he said, “Oh yes, search the cave. Do search\r\n    it. But I’ll tell you what you will find. You will find a great\r\n    red devil in there; he lives up at the end of the cave. You\r\n    won’t be able to see him, because the cave turns at the end,\r\n    and the devil always stands just round the turn, and he has\r\n    got a great long knife in his hand, and the moment your head\r\n    appears round the corner he will slice it off, and then he will\r\n    pull the body in to him and eat it. Go in; do go in—the poor\r\n    devil is hungry. It is three weeks since he had anything to\r\n    eat, and then it was only a goat. He loves men, does this red\r\n    devil; and if you all go in he will have such a meal!”\r\n\r\nMetcalfe guessed that he was intended to hear this speech and act upon\r\nit. The cave, a short distance from the entrance, turned at right angles.\r\nHe stood with his sword uplifted just round the corner, while a line\r\nof dismounted cavalry, in single file, one daring fellow leading, came\r\nslowly up the cave. As soon as the leader put his head in the darkness\r\nround the corner, Metcalfe smote with all his strength. The fellow’s\r\nhead rolled from his body, and his companions, with a yell of terror,\r\nand tumbling one over another in the darkness, fled. “Did you see him?”\r\ndemanded Metcalfe’s friend outside. “Do go back; he wants more than\r\none.” But the rebel cavalry had had enough. The men who had gone up\r\nthe cave declared that they had actually seen the red fiend, and been\r\nscorched by the gleam of his eyes; and, mounting their horses, they fled.\r\n\r\n“Why did you save my life?” Metcalfe asked his protector. “Because you\r\nare a just man,” was the reply. “How do you know that?” asked Metcalfe.\r\n“You decided a case against me in your court,” was the unexpected reply.\r\n“I and all my family had won the case in the inferior courts by lying,\r\nbut you found us out, and gave judgment against us. If you had given the\r\ncase for me I would not have saved your life!”\r\n\r\nWilberforce tells another tale which graphically illustrates the wild\r\nadventures of those wild days. Early one morning he was on picket duty\r\noutside Delhi, and in the grey dawn saw two men and a boy hurrying along\r\nthe road from the city. They were evidently fugitives, and, telling his\r\nmen not to fire on them, Wilberforce went forward to meet them. When the\r\ngroup came up the boy ran forward, threw his arms round Wilberforce’s\r\nneck, and, with an exclamation in English, kissed him. The “boy” was a\r\nwoman named Mrs. Leeson, the sole survivor of the Delhi massacre. She had\r\nbeen concealed for more than three months by a friendly native, and had\r\nat last escaped disguised as an Afghan boy.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mutiny broke out she, with some other ladies and a few\r\nEnglishmen, took refuge in a cellar, and for nearly three days maintained\r\na desperate defence against the crowds attacking them. The hero of the\r\ndefence was a Baptist missionary, a former shipmate of Wilberforce’s, “a\r\nvery tall and powerful man, with a bloodless face, grey eyes, a broad\r\njaw, and a determined mouth.” One by one the men holding the cellar fell.\r\nFood failed, the ammunition was exhausted, and at last, behind the bodies\r\nof the fallen, piled up as a breastwork, stood only the brave missionary,\r\nwith nothing but his sword to protect the crouching women and children.\r\n“Stripped to the waist, behind the ghastly rampart of the dead, the\r\nhero stood; and for hours this Horatius held his own. At last he fell,\r\nshot through the heart, and the bloodthirsty devils poured in.” Mrs.\r\nLeeson was covered by some of the dead bodies, and so escaped the doom\r\nof the other ladies, and at night crept out of that pit of the dead. She\r\nwandered through the dark streets, the only living Englishwoman in the\r\ngreat city, and saw, hanging up on the trees in the dusk, the headless\r\ntrunks of white children and the mutilated bodies of Englishwomen. By\r\nhappy chance she met a pitying native, who concealed her until she\r\nescaped in the fashion described, with more or less of imagination, by\r\nWilberforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCAWNPORE: THE SIEGE\r\n\r\n\r\n    The annals of warfare contain no episode so painful as the\r\n    story of this siege. It moves to tears as surely as the pages\r\n    in which the greatest of all historians tells, as only he can\r\n    tell, the last agony of the Athenian host in Sicily. The sun\r\n    never before looked on such a sight as a crowd of women and\r\n    children cooped within a small space, and exposed, during\r\n    twenty days and nights, to the concentrated fire of thousands\r\n    of muskets and a score of heavy cannon.\r\n\r\nIn these words Sir George Trevelyan sums up the famous struggle round\r\nthe low mud-walls of Wheeler’s entrenchments at Cawnpore more than forty\r\nyears ago; a struggle in which Saxon courage and Hindu cruelty were\r\nexhibited in their highest measure, and which must always form one of\r\nthe most heartbreaking and yet kindling traditions of the British race.\r\nVolumes have been written about Cawnpore, but Trevelyan’s book remains\r\nits one adequate literary record. The writer has a faculty for resonant,\r\nnot to say rhythmic prose, which recalls the style of his more famous\r\nuncle, Macaulay, and in his “Cawnpore” his picturesque sentences are\r\nflushed with a sympathy which gives them a more than literary grace.\r\n\r\nCawnpore at the time of the Mutiny was a great city, famous for its\r\nworkers in leather, standing on the banks of the sacred Ganges, 270 miles\r\nS.E. from Delhi, and about 700 miles from Calcutta. It was a military\r\nstation of great importance. Its vast magazine was stored with warlike\r\nmaterial of every sort. It was the seat of civil administration for a\r\nrich district. But the characteristic British policy, which allows the\r\nEmpire to expand indefinitely, without any corresponding expansion of\r\nthe army which acts as its police and defence, left this great military\r\nstation practically in the hands of the Sepoys alone. The British force\r\nat Cawnpore, in May 1857, consisted of sixty men of the 84th, sixty-five\r\nMadras Fusileers, fewer than sixty artillerymen, and a group of invalids\r\nbelonging to the 32nd. The Sepoy force consisted of three strong infantry\r\nregiments and the 2nd Native Cavalry—a regiment of very evil fame.\r\n\r\nHere, then, were all the elements of a great tragedy—a rich treasury and\r\na huge arsenal, lying practically undefended; a strong force of Sepoys,\r\nbitter with mutiny; a turbulent city and crowded cantonments festering\r\nwith crime; and only a handful of British soldiers to maintain the\r\nBritish flag! Had the British consisted merely of fighting men, though\r\nthey counted only 300 bayonets against four regiments of splendidly\r\ntrained Sepoys, and a hostile population of 60,000, their case would not\r\nhave been desperate. But the little British garrison had under its guard\r\na great company of women and children and sick folk—civilian households,\r\nthe wives and families of the 32nd, and many more. For every fighting man\r\nwho levelled his musket over Wheeler’s entrenchments during the siege,\r\nthere were at least two non-combatants—women, or little children, or\r\ninvalids. A company so helpless and so great could not march; it could\r\nnot attack; it could only stand within its poor screen of mud-walls and,\r\nwith the stubborn and quenchless courage natural to its blood, fight till\r\nit perished.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Hugh Wheeler, who was in command at Cawnpore, was a gallant\r\nsoldier, who had marched and fought for fifty years. But he had the fatal\r\ndefect of being over seventy-five years of age. A little man, slender of\r\nbuild, with quick eye and erect figure, he carried his seventy-five years\r\nwith respectable energy. But a man, no matter how brave, in whose veins\r\nran the chill and thin blood of old age, was tragically handicapped in a\r\ncrisis so fierce. Wheeler, moreover, who had married a Hindu wife, was\r\ntoo weakly credulous about the loyalty of his Sepoys. On May 18, scarcely\r\na fortnight before the Mutiny, he telegraphed to Calcutta: “The plague\r\nis stayed. All well at Cawnpore!” He had been warned that Nana Sahib\r\nwas treacherous, yet he called in his help, and put the Treasury in his\r\ncharge for safety! This was committing the chickens, for security, to\r\nthe benevolence and “good faith” of the fox! Not four days before the\r\noutbreak Wheeler actually sent back to Lucknow fifty men of the 84th who\r\nhad been sent to him as a reinforcement. There was chivalry in that act,\r\nbut there was besotted credulity too.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAWNPORE June 1857.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wheeler’s Entrenchment June 4th.-27th. 1857.\r\n\r\nWalker & Cockerell sc.]\r\n\r\nBut Wheeler’s most fatal mistake was in the choice he made of the place\r\nwhere the British garrison was to make its last stand. The Cawnpore\r\nmagazine itself was a vast walled enclosure, covering three acres, with\r\nstrong buildings and exhaustless store of guns and ammunition, with the\r\nriver guarding one front, and a nullah acting as a ditch on another.\r\nHere would have been shelter for the women and the sick, a magnificent\r\nfighting position for the men, abundant water, and a great store of\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\nWheeler, for reasons which nobody has ever yet guessed, neglected this\r\nstrong post. He allowed its stores of cannon to be turned against\r\nhimself. He chose, instead of this formidable and sheltered post, a patch\r\nof open plain six miles distant, with practically no water supply. He\r\nthrew up a slender wall of earth, which a musket-ball could pierce, and\r\nover which an active cow could jump, and he crowded into this the whole\r\nBritish colony at Cawnpore.\r\n\r\n“What do you call that place you are making out on the plain?” asked\r\nthe Nana’s Prime Minister, Azimoolah, of a British officer. “You ought\r\nto call it the ‘Fort of Despair.’” “No, no,” answered the Englishman,\r\nwith the pluck of his race, “we’ll call it the ‘Fort of Victory!’”\r\nNevertheless, when Wheeler made that evil choice of a place of defence,\r\nhe was constructing a veritable Fort of Despair.\r\n\r\nWheeler, it seems, did not occupy the magazine, as it was held by a Sepoy\r\nguard, and it would have “shown mistrust,” and might have precipitated a\r\nconflict, if he had attempted to move into it. But what more expressive\r\nand public sign of “mistrust” could be imagined than the construction of\r\nthe entrenchment in the open plain? And what could more fatally damage\r\nBritish prestige than the spectacle of the entire British community,\r\nmilitary and civilian, crowding into these worthless defences!\r\n\r\nIf Wheeler did not occupy the magazine, he might have blown it up, and\r\nwith that act have turned to smoke all the resources of the rebels. This\r\nwas left to be done by Sepoy hands six weeks later. Meanwhile, Wheeler\r\nleft almost unlimited resources of guns and munitions of war in the hands\r\nof the mutineers—to be employed against himself!\r\n\r\nIn the grim pause, while waiting for the outbreak, the British garrison\r\nshowed a cool and gallant patience. The women, children, and civilians\r\ntook up their quarters every night within the earthworks, where some\r\nten light guns were mounted. But to “show their confidence” in their\r\nmen, and, if possible, still to hold them back from mutiny, the British\r\nofficers slept with their regiments. To lead a forlorn hope up the\r\nbroken slope of a breach, or to stand in an infantry square while, with\r\nthunder of galloping hoofs, a dozen squadrons of cavalry charge fiercely\r\ndown, needs courage. But it was a finer strain of courage still which\r\nmade a British officer leave his wife and children to sleep behind\r\nthe guns, standing loaded with grape, to protect them from a rush of\r\nmutineers, while he himself walked calmly down to sleep—or, at least, to\r\nfeign sleep—within the very lines of the mutineers themselves!\r\n\r\nOn the night of June 4 came the outbreak. The men of the 2nd Cavalry\r\nrushed to their stables, mounted, and, with mad shouts and wild firing\r\nof pistols, galloped off to seize the magazine and to “loot” the\r\nTreasury; and as they went they burnt and plundered and slew. The 1st\r\nSepoys followed them at once; the other two Sepoy regiments—the 53rd and\r\n56th—hesitated. Their officers, with entreaties and orders, kept them\r\nsteady till the sun rose, and then, unfortunately, dismissed them to\r\ntheir tents. Here they were quickly corrupted by their comrades, who had\r\nreturned laden with booty from the plundered Treasury.\r\n\r\nBut before they had actually broken into mutiny, while they were yet\r\nswaying to and fro in agitated groups, by some blunder a gun from\r\nWheeler’s entrenchments opened on the Sepoys’ lines. The argument of the\r\nflying grape was final! The men broke, and—a tumultuous mob—made for the\r\ncity. Even then, however, some eighty Sepoys kept their fidelity, and\r\nactually joined the British within their defences, and fought bravely\r\nside by side with them for nearly twenty desperate days.\r\n\r\nFor a few wild hours murder raged through the streets of Cawnpore. Then\r\nthe mutineers turned their faces towards Delhi. Had no malign influence\r\narrested their march the great tragedy might have been escaped, and\r\nthe word “Cawnpore” would not be to-day the most tragical cluster of\r\nsyllables in British history. But at this point the subtle and evil\r\ngenius of Nana Sahib interposed with dire effect.\r\n\r\nNana Sahib—or, to give his proper name, Seereek Dhoondoo Punth—was a\r\nHindu of low birth, who had been adopted by the Peishwa of Poonah, the\r\nlast representative of a great Mahratta dynasty, a prince who had been\r\ndethroned, but assigned a royal pension by the East India Company.\r\nNana Sahib on the Peishwa’s death, inherited his private fortune, a\r\nsum computed at £4,000,000 sterling; but he also claimed the great\r\npension which the Peishwa enjoyed. The Company rejected that claim, and\r\nhenceforth Nana Sahib was a man consumed with hate of the British name\r\nand power. He concealed that hate, however, beneath a smiling mask of\r\ncourteous hospitality. His agent had seen the wasted British lines round\r\nSebastopol, and reported to his master that the British strength was\r\nbroken. Nana Sahib, too, who understood the Hindu character, saw that\r\nthe Sepoy regiments in Bengal were drunk with arrogance, and inflamed\r\nto the verge of mere lunacy, with fanatical suspicions, while a British\r\ngarrison was almost non-existent.\r\n\r\nHere, then, were the elements of a great outbreak, and Nana Sahib\r\nbelieved that the British raj was about to perish. He threw in his lot\r\nwith the mutineers, but he had no idea of following them to Delhi, and\r\nbeing merged in the crowd that plotted and wrangled in the royal palace\r\nthere. He would build up a great power for himself round Cawnpore. He\r\nmight make himself, he dreamed, the despot of Northern India. He might\r\neven, by-and-by, march as a conqueror down the valley of the Ganges,\r\nfight a new Plassey, very different from the last, and, to quote\r\nTrevelyan, “renew the Black Hole of Calcutta, under happier auspices and\r\non a more generous scale, and so teach those Christian dogs what it was\r\nto flout a Mahratta!”\r\n\r\nBut, as a preliminary to all this, the great company of Christian people\r\nwithin Wheeler’s lines must be stamped out of existence. “The wolves,\r\nwith their mates and whelps, had been hounded into their den, and now or\r\nnever was the time to smoke them out and knock on the head the whole of\r\nthat formidable brood.” So, with bribes, and promises, and threats, Nana\r\nbrought back the Sepoys, who had begun their Delhi march, to Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, with an odd touch of official formality, Nana sent in notice\r\nto General Wheeler that he was about to attack his position. Sunday,\r\nJune 7, was spent in hunting from their various places of concealment\r\nin Cawnpore all the unhappy Europeans who lingered there. One trembling\r\nfamily was discovered lurking under a bridge, another concealed in some\r\nnative huts. They were dragged out with shouts of triumph and despatched.\r\nOne Englishman, who had taken refuge in a native house, held it against\r\nthe Sepoys till his last cartridge was expended, then walked out and bade\r\nthem cut his throat—a request promptly complied with. When the safe and\r\ndelightful luxury of hunting out solitary Europeans was exhausted, then\r\nbegan the attack on the British entrenchments.\r\n\r\nThe odds were tremendous! In the centre of Wheeler’s entrenchment stood\r\ntwo single-storeyed barracks, built of thin brickwork, with verandas, and\r\none of them roofed with straw. The mud wall, which formed the defence\r\nof the position, was four feet high, so thin that a rifle-ball could\r\npierce it, with rough gaps made for the ten light pieces which formed\r\nthe artillery of the garrison. On the north side of the entrenchment was\r\na little triangular outwork, which the British called the Redan. On its\r\nleft front, some four hundred yards distant, was a row of unfinished\r\nbarracks, part of which was held by the British, part by the Sepoys, and\r\nwhich became the scene of the most bloody fighting of the siege. Behind\r\nthese slender bulwarks was gathered a company of perhaps a thousand\r\nsouls, of whom more than half were women and children.\r\n\r\nAt first the barracks gave to the non-combatants a brief shelter; but\r\nthe 24-pounders of the Sepoys pierced them as though they had been built\r\nof cheese, and before many hours they were shattered into wreck, and the\r\nbesieged were practically without any shelter, not merely from the rain\r\nof lead, but from the consuming heat of Indian suns and the heavy dews of\r\nIndian nights.\r\n\r\nSometimes, indeed, the men dug holes in the earth, into which their\r\nwives and children might creep and be sheltered by a few planks from\r\nthe intolerable glare of the sun, and the incessant flight of hostile\r\nbullets. Quite as commonly, however, a British officer or civilian, as\r\nhe crouched behind the poor wall of earth, loaded musket in hand, saw\r\nthe white faces of his children as they slept or moaned, in the ditch\r\nby his side, while the wasted figure of his wife bent over them. There\r\nwas no privacy, or shelter, or rest. The supply of food quickly failed.\r\nThere was not water enough to satisfy the little children who cried from\r\nthirst, or to bathe the shattered limbs of the wounded. The men had the\r\nfierce excitement of fighting; but who shall paint the anguish of English\r\nladies—wives and mothers—who could not find water for their children’s\r\nfevered lips, or shelter them from sun and bullet.\r\n\r\nThe imagination lingers pitifully over those groups of British ladies\r\nsitting or crouching in the ditches under the earthworks: “Unshod,\r\nunkempt, ragged and squalid, haggard and emaciated, parched with drought\r\nand faint with hunger, they sat waiting to hear that they were widows.\r\nWoe was it in those days unto them that were with child. There were\r\ninfants born during the terrible three weeks—infants with no future.”\r\n\r\nThere were two wells in the encampment; one which, to quote Trevelyan,\r\n“yielded nothing then, which will yield nothing till the sea, too,\r\ngives up her dead.” It was some two hundred yards from the rampart, and\r\nlay open to the fire of the Sepoys’ batteries. It was turned into a\r\nsepulchre. Thither, night by night, the besieged carried their dead, and\r\ncast them into its depths with brief and whispered prayer; while the guns\r\nof the Sepoys thundered their requiem. Within three weeks 250 English\r\npeople were cast by English hands into that strange grave. The other\r\nwell lay also directly under hostile fire, and on it the Sepoy gunners,\r\ntrained by British science, concentrated their fire night and day. Every\r\ndrop of water drawn from it may be said to have been reddened with blood.\r\n\r\nOver this handful of British people, faint with hunger, fevered with\r\nthirst, wasted by sickness, half mad with the sun’s heat, roared day\r\nand night a tempest of hostile shot. Never before, perhaps, was such a\r\nfire concentrated on one poor patch of soil. The Sepoys could mount as\r\nmany guns as they chose, and almost of whatever calibre they pleased.\r\nAnd they could fire, within a distance ranging from 300 to 800 yards,\r\nfrom under almost shot-proof shelter. From roof and window of all the\r\nbuildings commanding the entrenchments streamed, with scarcely a moment’s\r\npause, showers of musketry bullets. At night the Sepoys crept within\r\npistol-shot, and fired without cessation. Wheeler’s entrenchments were\r\nliterally girdled with fire; they were whipped, day and night, with\r\nincessant volleys.\r\n\r\nBy the third day every window and door in the poor barracks which served\r\nas shelter to the sick, and to the women and children, had been beaten\r\nin; and shell and ball ranged at will through the rooms. One who saw the\r\nbuilding after the siege wrote: “The walls are riddled with cannon-shot\r\nlike the cells of a honeycomb. The doors are knocked into shapeless\r\nopenings. Of the verandas only a few splintered rafters remain. At some\r\nof the angles the walls are knocked entirely away, and large chasms gape\r\nblackly at you.”\r\n\r\nNever was a position more desperate; and never was there one held with a\r\nvalour more obstinate. Wheeler’s men had everything that was most dear\r\nto them at their backs, and everything that was most hateful in their\r\nfront; and under these conditions how they fought may be imagined. In\r\nthe scanty garrison, too, were over a hundred officers of the regiments\r\nin mutiny, fighters of the finest quality. It was a _corps d’élite_; a\r\ngarrison of officers!\r\n\r\nIndian life, it may be added, develops all that is proudest and most\r\nmanly in the British character. The Englishman there feels that he is\r\na member of an imperial and conquering race. To rule men is his daily\r\nbusiness. To hunt the fiercest game in the world is his amusement.\r\nThe men who knelt behind Wheeler’s mud walls, had faced tigers in the\r\njungle, had speared the wild boar in the plains, had heard the scream of\r\na charging elephant. They were steady of nerve, quick of eye, deadly of\r\naim, proud of their blood and race. They were standing at bay over their\r\nwives and little ones, playing a game in which the stake was a thousand\r\nBritish lives. And never before, or since, perhaps, was more gallant\r\nfighting done than behind Wheeler’s entrenchments.\r\n\r\nThe natural leaders of the garrison emerged in such a crisis, and their\r\nnames ought to awaken to-day in British ears emotions of pride as lofty\r\nas that which Greeks knew when, in the rolling and sonorous cadences of\r\nHomer’s great epic, they heard the names of the heroes who fought and\r\ndied round classic Troy. One of the most heroic figures in the siege is\r\nthat of Captain Moore, of the 32nd, in charge of the cluster of invalids\r\nbelonging to that regiment in Cawnpore. Moore was an Irishman, though\r\nwith the fair hair and blue eyes proper to Saxon blood. To say that he\r\nwas fearless is a very inadequate description of his temper. He delighted\r\nin the rapture and glow of battle. His courage had in it a certain cool\r\nand smiling quality that made flurry or anxiety impossible. Moore, in\r\nfact, carried about with him a sort of radiance, so that, as Trevelyan\r\nputs it, “wherever he had passed he left men something more courageous,\r\nand women something less unhappy.” This fair-haired Irishman was a born\r\nking of men, of unfailing resource and “dare-devil” courage. He was\r\nwounded early in the siege, and carried his arm in a sling, but he walked\r\nto and fro calmly amid a tempest of bullets, and the men would follow his\r\ncheerful leading against any odds.\r\n\r\nThe tiny little Redan on the north face of the entrenchment was held by\r\nMajor Vibart, of the 2nd Cavalry. A dreadful cross-fire searched and\r\nraked this little triangle of earth, and the handful of heroes that\r\nheld it had to be renewed again and again. But the Redan kept up its\r\nsplutter of answering fire day and night for three weeks, and Vibart\r\nhimself survived the siege, to perish under Sepoy bullets on the river.\r\nAshe was a young artillery officer of great promise; he commanded a\r\nbattery of three guns at the north-east corner of the entrenchments,\r\nand seldom were guns better aimed and better fought. Ashe had first to\r\ninvent his gunners, and next to improvise his shot, firing 6-pound balls,\r\nfor example, from a 9-pound muzzle. But his cool science and sleepless\r\nactivity made his battery the terror of the Sepoys.\r\n\r\nDelafosse, of the 53rd, one of the four men who actually survived the\r\nsiege, was an officer as daring and almost as skilled as Ashe. He had\r\ncharge of three 9-pounder guns at the south-east angle. On one occasion\r\nthe carriage of a gun in his battery took fire, and the wood, made as\r\ninflammable as tinder by the fierce Indian sun, named and crackled. There\r\nwas powder—and the peril of explosion—on every side. The Sepoys, noting\r\nthe dancing flame, turned all their guns on the spot. Delafosse crawled\r\nbeneath the burning carriage, turned on his back, and with his naked\r\nhands pulled down the red splinters, and scattered earth on the flames,\r\nfighting them in this desperate fashion till two soldiers ran up to his\r\nhelp, and the fire was put out.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most obstinate and bloody fighting during the siege took\r\nplace in the line of unfinished barracks which crossed the S.W. angle\r\nof the entrenchments. The Sepoys held the northern half of this line of\r\nbuildings. Of the three buildings to the south—which completely commanded\r\nthe entrenchment—what was called “No. 4,” was held by a party of amateur\r\nsoldiers—civil engineers employed on the East Indian railroads. There\r\nwere a dozen of them, young fellows more familiar with theodolites than\r\nwith rifles; but a cluster of English Lifeguards could not have fought\r\nwith cooler bravery. And the civil engineers had a keenness of wit and a\r\nfertility of mechanical resource which veteran soldiers might easily have\r\nlacked.\r\n\r\nVainly the Sepoys pelted “No. 4” with 24-pounder shot, scourged it with\r\nmusketry fire, or made wild rushes upon it. The gallant railway men\r\ndevised new barriers for the doors, and new shields for the windows, and\r\nshot with cool and deadly aim, before which the Sepoys fell like rabbits.\r\n“No. 4,” like Hougoumont at Waterloo, might be battered into wreck, but\r\ncould not be captured. In the Memorial Church at Cawnpore to-day, not the\r\nleast touching tablet is one upon which is inscribed:—\r\n\r\n    To the memory of the Engineers of the East India Railway, who\r\n    died and were killed in the great insurrection of 1857. Erected\r\n    in affectionate remembrance by their brother Engineers in the\r\n    North-Western Provinces.\r\n\r\nBarrack No. 2 was a microscopic fortress, as fiercely attacked, and as\r\nvaliantly defended as Barrack No. 4. It was first held by Lieutenant\r\nGlanville and a party of fourteen officers. Glanville was desperately\r\nwounded, and three-fourths of his heroic garrison killed; then the\r\nbarrack was put in charge of Mowbray Thomson, of the 56th Native\r\nInfantry, one of the two officers who survived Cawnpore. Only sixteen men\r\ncould find standing and fighting room in the barrack. The sixteen under\r\nMowbray Thomson consisted of Ensign Henderson, a mere boy, half-a-dozen\r\nMadras Fusileers, two plate-layers from the railway works, and seven men\r\nof the 84th. As the garrison dwindled under the ever-scorching fire that\r\nplayed on the building, it was fed with new recruits. “Sometimes,” says\r\nMowbray Thomson, “a civilian, sometimes a soldier came.” But soldier and\r\ncivilian alike plied his rifle with a grim and silent courage that never\r\ngrew flurried, and that never knew fear.\r\n\r\nMowbray Thomson, who was of an ingenious turn, contrived a perch in the\r\ntopmost angle of the barrack wall, and planted there an officer named\r\nStirling, who was at an age when other lads are playing at cricket with\r\ntheir schoolmates, but who was a quick and most deadly shot, and who\r\n“bagged” Sepoys as a sportsman, with a breech-loading shot-gun, might\r\nbag pheasants in a populous cover. Sometimes, on an agreed signal, the\r\ngarrisons from No. 2 and No. 4 would dash out together, a little knot of\r\nragged, unwashed, smoke-blackened Sahibs, counting about thirty in all,\r\nand running without regular order, but with that expression on their\r\nfaces which the Sepoys knew meant tragical business; and, with musket and\r\nbayonet or hog-spear, they would sweep the line of barracks from end to\r\nend.\r\n\r\nNor was courage confined to the fighting men. In one fierce sally, at an\r\nearly stage of the siege, eleven mutineers were captured. A desperate\r\nfight was raging at the moment, and every man was required at the front.\r\nA rope was hastily passed round the wrists of the eleven captured\r\nSepoys, and they were put into the charge of the wife of a private of the\r\n32nd, named Bridget Widdowson. Drawn sword in hand, this soldier’s wife,\r\nwho had little children of her own in the beleaguered entrenchments,\r\nstood over the eleven mutineers, while they squatted nervously on their\r\nhams before her; and so business-like was the nourish of her weapon, so\r\nkeen the sparkle in her eye, that not one man of the eleven dared to\r\nmove. It was only when a guard of the stronger sex took Bridget’s place\r\nthat the eleven, somehow, contrived to escape. Later on in the siege the\r\nsupply of cartridges failed, and all the ladies were requisitioned for\r\ntheir stockings, to be used in the construction of new cartridges. When\r\nbefore, or since, did war claim for its service such strange material!\r\n\r\nThe Sepoys, at intervals, made furious assaults on the mud walls, but\r\nthese were lined by shots too deadly, and held by hands too strong,\r\nto make success possible. Had the British, indeed, been the attacking\r\nforce, they would have swept over the poor earthen barrier, not four feet\r\nhigh, with a single charge, before the siege was a dozen hours old. But,\r\nduring the whole three weeks of their attack, though the Sepoys, counting\r\nfighting men, outnumbered their foes by, perhaps, thirty to one, they\r\nnever succeeded in even reaching the irregular line of earth behind which\r\nthe British stood.\r\n\r\nTheir best chance occurred when, on the eighth night of the bombardment,\r\nthe thatch on the barrack used as a hospital, took fire. The whole\r\nbuilding was quickly in flames, and in their red light the entrenchment,\r\nin every part, was as visible as at noonday. The barrack was used as\r\na sleeping-place for the women and children of the 32nd. These fled\r\nfrom the burning building, but not all the sick and wounded could be\r\nrescued; some perished in the smoke and flame. That was, indeed, a night\r\nof horror. “The roar of the flames,” says Trevelyan, “lost every ten\r\nseconds in the peal of the rebel artillery; the whistle of the great\r\nshot; the shrieks of the sufferers, who forgot their pain in the helpless\r\nanticipation of a sudden and agonising death; the group of crying women\r\nand children huddled together in the ditch; the stream of men running to\r\nand fro between the houses, laden with sacks of provisions, and kegs of\r\nammunition, and living burdens more precious still; the guards crouching\r\nsilent and watchful, finger on trigger, each at his station along the\r\nexternal wall; the forms of countless foes, revealed now and again by the\r\nfitful glare, prowling around through the outer gloom”—all this made up a\r\nstrangely terrible scene.\r\n\r\nIt is a proof of the quality of Moore’s daring that, by way of proving\r\nto the Sepoys that this calamity had not lowered the spirits of the\r\ngarrison, he organised on the following night a sally, and, with fifty\r\npicked men, dashed out on the rebel lines, swept them for many hundreds\r\nof yards, spiked a number of 24-pounder guns, and slew their gunners.\r\n\r\nBut the burning of the barracks was the fatal turning-point of the siege.\r\nIt destroyed the last shelter of the sick and the women and children. The\r\nwhole stock of medicines and of surgical appliances was consumed, and\r\nthe wounded could no longer have their injuries dressed. The eighty odd\r\nSepoys who formed part of the garrison had been lodged in the building\r\nnow burned. It was deemed imprudent to allow them to mix with the\r\ngarrison generally, and they were told to provide for themselves, and\r\nwere allowed to steal out of the entrenchment and escape.\r\n\r\nThe deaths amongst the British multiplied fast. The fire of the Sepoys\r\ngrew more furious. “The round shot crashed and spun through the windows,\r\nraked the earthworks, and skipped about the open ground in every corner\r\nof our position. The bullets cut the air, and pattered on the wall\r\nlike hail. The great shells rolled hissing along the floors and down\r\nthe trenches, and, bursting, spread around them a circle of wreck and\r\nmutilation and promiscuous destruction.”\r\n\r\nHow fast the poor besieged wretches perished under this deadly hail may\r\nbe imagined. A bomb, for example, fell into a cluster of seven ladies and\r\nslew them all in a breath. A soldier’s wife, carrying a twin child on\r\neach shoulder, with her husband by her side, was crossing a fire-raked\r\nangle of the entrenchment. The same ball slew the husband, shattered both\r\nelbows of the wife, and tore asunder the body of one of the little twins.\r\nGeneral Wheeler’s son was lying wounded. His mother and two sisters were\r\nbusy tending him, his father looking on, when a cannon-ball tore through\r\nthe wall of the room and smashed the wounded lad’s head literally to\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nOne well had been turned into a sepulchre; to-day it is built over, and\r\non the monument above it is written this inscription:—\r\n\r\n    In a well under this enclosure were laid by the hands of their\r\n    fellows in suffering the bodies of men, women, and children\r\n    who died hard by during the heroic defence of Wheeler’s\r\n    entrenchment, when beleaguered by the rebel Nana.\r\n\r\nThen follows a verse from Psalm cxli:—\r\n\r\n    “Our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth, as when one\r\n    cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth. But mine eyes are\r\n    unto Thee, O God the Lord.”\r\n\r\nThe scanty supplies of water for that thirst-wasted crowd had to be drawn\r\nfrom the other well, and on it the Sepoys, day and night, concentrated\r\ntheir fire. To draw from it was a literal service of death. One\r\nbrave-hearted civilian, named John MacKillop, described himself as “no\r\nfighting man,” but claimed to be appointed “captain of the well,” and\r\ndevoted himself to the business of drawing water, the most dangerous task\r\nof the whole entrenchment. He kept to his task for nearly a week, and\r\nthen, while drawing a vessel of water, was shot.\r\n\r\nHe staggered a few paces, mortally wounded, then fell, but held up with\r\nhis dying hands the vessel filled with the precious fluid, and begged one\r\nwho ran to his help to carry it to the lady to whom he had promised it.\r\nBayard, dying on the banks of the Secia, and handing the water for which\r\nhe himself thirsted to another dying soldier, has not a better title to\r\nbe remembered than simple-minded John MacKillop, the “captain” of the\r\nCawnpore well.\r\n\r\nOn June 24—when for nineteen days the wretched garrison had been under\r\ngun-fire—Wheeler writes to Lawrence, “All our carriages more or less\r\ndisabled, ammunition short.... We have no instruments, no medicine: the\r\nBritish spirit alone remains; but it cannot last for ever.... Surely we\r\nare not left to die like rats in a cage.” Lawrence writes back on June\r\n27, giving what encouragement he can, and warning him not to accept any\r\nterms. “You cannot rely on the Nana’s promises. _Il a tué beaucoup de\r\nprisonniers._”\r\n\r\nBy the twenty-first day of the siege the position of the British was\r\nhopeless. Food had almost completely failed. Their guns had become\r\nunserviceable. The unconquerable garrison was fast dwindling. “At rare\r\nintervals behind the earthwork they stood—gaunt and feeble likenesses\r\nof men—clutching with muffled fingers the barrels of their muskets,\r\nwhich glowed with heat intolerable to the naked hand, so fierce was the\r\nblaze of the mid-day sun.” They might have sallied out and cut their way\r\nthrough their enemies, or died fighting amongst them; and they would have\r\ndone so fifty times over but for one consideration. They could not take\r\ntheir women and children with them; they could not abandon them. There\r\nwas the certainty, too, that the Indian rains, long delayed, must soon\r\nburst upon them. Then their firearms would be rendered useless; the holes\r\nin which the women and children crouched would be flooded; their wall of\r\nmud would be washed away.\r\n\r\nNo sign of help came from without. Wheeler’s last despatch, dated June\r\n24, ended with the words, “We want aid, aid, aid.” But not merely no aid,\r\nno whisper even from the outer world reached the unhappy garrison.\r\n\r\nThe Sepoys, on their part, were growing weary of the siege. Their losses\r\nwere enormous. They might batter the entrenchments into dust, but they\r\ncould not capture an inch of the blackened area these shot-wrecked\r\nlines of earth girdled. These Sahibs were fiercer than wounded tigers.\r\nThey were, indeed, perplexingly and disquietingly aggressive. They were\r\nperpetually making fierce little sallies, whose track was marked by\r\nslaughtered Sepoys. Nana Sahib felt there was real danger that his allies\r\nmight abandon their desperate task. He therefore undertook to accomplish\r\nby craft what the Sepoys could not do with cannon and bayonet.\r\n\r\nNana Sahib unearthed from some gloomy room in the building which formed\r\nhis headquarters a captive Englishwoman waiting to be slaughtered, and\r\nsent her as a messenger to the entrenchments on the morning of June 24.\r\n“All those,” ran the brief note, “who are in no way connected with the\r\nacts of Lord Dalhousie, and are willing to lay down their arms, shall\r\nreceive a safe passage to Allahabad.”\r\n\r\nWheeler, with a soldier’s pride, was unwilling to give up the patch of\r\nground he held for the Queen. The younger men, with the flame of battle\r\nin their blood, were eager to fight to the bitter end. To trust to\r\nthe faith of mutineers, or to the humanity of a Hindu of Nana Sahib’s\r\ntiger-like nature, they argued, was a sadly desperate venture. Yet\r\nthat way there might lie a chance of life for the women and children.\r\nDeath was certain if the siege lasted. It might be less certain if they\r\ncapitulated.\r\n\r\nThe 25th was spent in negotiations. Moore and two others met the Nana’s\r\nrepresentatives at a spot 200 yards outside the entrenchments. They\r\noffered to surrender on condition that they were allowed to march out\r\nunder arms, with sixty rounds of ammunition to each man; that carriages\r\nwere provided for the wounded, the ladies, and the children; and that\r\nboats, duly stocked with food, were supplied to carry them to Allahabad.\r\nIn the afternoon the Nana sent in a verbal message saying that he\r\naccepted the terms, and the British must march out that night. They\r\nrefused to do this, as they needed to make some preparations. On this,\r\nthe Nana sent an insolent message announcing that he must have his will;\r\nthat if they delayed he would open on them with all his guns; and, as\r\nthey were perishing fast from mere hunger, a few hours would leave not\r\none of them alive.\r\n\r\nWhiting, a gallant soldier, met the insolent threat with high courage.\r\nLet the Nana’s soldiers, if they liked, he answered, try to carry the\r\nentrenchments. They had tried in vain for three weeks to do so. “If\r\npushed to the last extremity,” Whiting added, “they had powder enough in\r\nthe magazine to blow both armies into the Ganges!”\r\n\r\nThen the Nana changed his tone, and grew effusively polite. His\r\nemissaries condoled with Wheeler for the sufferings he had gone through.\r\nBut, thanks to Allah, the Ever-Merciful, all was ended now! The sahibs\r\nand the memsahibs had nothing before them but a pleasant river voyage to\r\ntheir friends! A committee of British officers, under a guard of rebel\r\ncavalry, inspected the boats gathered at the landing-place, scarcely a\r\nmile distant from the entrenchments; at their request temporary floors\r\nof bamboos were laid down in the boats, and roofs of thatch stretched\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nNana Sahib, as a matter of fact, meant murder; murder, sudden, bloody,\r\nand all-embracing. But he enjoyed, so to speak, toying with his\r\nunconscious victims beforehand. Over the gorgon-like visage of murder\r\nhe hung a smiling and dainty mask, and with soft-voiced courtesy he\r\nconsented to all arrangements for the “comfort” of his victims!\r\n\r\nThat night at Cawnpore there were two busy spots, a mile distant from\r\neach other. In the entrenchments the poor survivors were preparing for\r\ntheir march, a march—though they knew it not—to the grave. Mothers were\r\ncollecting the garments of their little ones. Some paid a last sad visit\r\nto the fatal well, where their dead were lying. Others were packing their\r\nscanty possessions, intending to carry them with them. Soldiers were\r\ncleaning their muskets and storing their cartridges. And a mile distant,\r\nTantia Topee, the Nana’s general, was planting his cannon and arranging\r\nhis Sepoys so as to pour upon the boats at a given signal a fire which\r\nshould slay the whole unhappy company they carried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCAWNPORE: THE MURDER GHAUT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a company of some 450 persons—old and young, sick and wounded,\r\nmen, women, and children—who filed out of Wheeler’s entrenchments on the\r\nmorning of June 27, in that sad pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nTrevelyan describes the scene:—\r\n\r\n    First came the men of the 32nd Regiment, their dauntless\r\n    captain at their head; thinking little as ever of the past,\r\n    but much of the future; and so marching unconscious towards\r\n    the death which he had often courted. Then moved on the throng\r\n    of native bearers, groaning in monotonous cadence beneath the\r\n    weight of the palanquins, through whose sliding panels might be\r\n    discerned the pallid forms of the wounded; their limbs rudely\r\n    bandaged with shirt-sleeves and old stockings and strips of\r\n    gown and petticoat. And next, musket on shoulder and revolver\r\n    in belt, followed they who could still walk and fight. Step was\r\n    not kept in those ranks. Little was there of martial array,\r\n    or soldier-like gait and attitude. In discoloured flannel and\r\n    tattered nankeen, mute and in pensive mood, tramped by the\r\n    remnant of the immortal garrison. These men had finished their\r\n    toil, and had fought their battle, and now, if hope was all but\r\n    dead within them, there survived at least no residue of fear.\r\n\r\nVibart, in his single person, constituted the rearguard. A wounded man\r\nlying in a bed carried by four native bearers, an English lady walking\r\nby his side, came out of the entrenchment shortly after the rest had\r\nleft. It was Colonel Ewart, of the 34th, with his faithful wife. The\r\nlittle group could not overtake the main body, and when it had passed out\r\nof sight round a bend in the road a crowd of the colonel’s own Sepoys\r\nstopped the poor wife and her wounded husband. The porters were ordered\r\nto lay the bed down, and with brutal jests the Sepoys mocked their dying\r\ncolonel. “Is not this a fine parade?” they asked, with shouts of laughter.\r\n\r\nThen, mirth giving place to murder, they suddenly fell upon Ewart, and\r\nliterally hewed him to pieces under the eyes of his agonised wife. They\r\ntold her to go in peace, as they would not kill a woman, and by way of\r\ncomment on the statement one of them stepped back to give himself room\r\nfor the stroke, and slew her with a single blow.\r\n\r\nThe road to the Ganges, a little over a mile in length, crossed a little\r\nwooden bridge painted white, and swung to the right down a ravine to the\r\nriver. “A vast multitude,” says Trevelyan, “speechless and motionless\r\nas spectres, watched their descent into that valley of the shadow of\r\ndeath.” Directly the last Englishman had crossed the bridge and turned\r\ndown the lane, a double line of Sepoys was drawn across the entrance to\r\nthe Ghaut, and slowly the great company made its way down to the river’s\r\nedge. Some forty boats were lying there—eight-oared country budgerows,\r\nclumsy structures, with thatched roofs, and looking not unlike floating\r\nhay-stacks. They lay in the shallow water a few yards from the bank.\r\n\r\nA moment’s pause took place when the crowd of sahibs and memsahibs, with\r\ntheir wounded and the little ones, reached the water’s edge. There were\r\nno planks by which they could reach the boats, none of the boatmen spoke\r\na word, or made a movement. They sat silent, like spectators at a tragedy.\r\n\r\nThen the crowd splashed into the water. The wounded were lifted into the\r\nboats; women with their children clambered on board; the men were finding\r\ntheir places; the officers, standing knee-deep in the river, were helping\r\nthe last and feeblest to embark. It was nine o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the hot morning air, a bugle screamed shrill and menacing,\r\nsomewhere up the ravine. It was the signal! Out of the forty boats the\r\nnative boatmen leaped, and splashed through the water to the bank. Into\r\nthe straw roofs of many of the boats they thrust, almost in the act\r\nof leaping, red-hot embers, and nearly a score of boats were almost\r\ninstantly red-crested with flames.\r\n\r\nA little white Hindu temple high up on the bank overlooked the whole\r\nscene. Here sat Tantia Topee, the Nana’s general, with a cluster of Sepoy\r\nofficers. He controlled the whole drama from this point of vantage\r\nlike a stage-manager; and, on his signal, from the lines of Sepoys who\r\nwere lying concealed in the undergrowth, from guns perched high on\r\nthe river-bank, and from both sides of the river at once, there broke\r\nupon the forty boats, with their flaming roofs and hapless crowds of\r\nwhite-faced passengers, a terrific storm of shot.\r\n\r\nThose slain by the sudden bullet were many, and were happy in their\r\nfate. The wounded perished under the burning flakes and strangling smoke\r\nof the flaming straw roofs. Many leaped into the river, and, crouching\r\nchin-deep under the sides of the boats, tried to shelter themselves from\r\nthe cruel tempest of shot. Some swam out into the stream till they sank\r\nin the reddened water under the leisurely aim of the Sepoys. Others,\r\nleaping into the water, tried to push off the stranded boats. Some of yet\r\nsterner temper, kneeling under the roofs of burning thatch, or standing\r\nwaist-deep in the Ganges, fired back on the Sepoys, who by this time\r\nlined the river’s edge.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wheeler, according to one report, perished beneath the stroke\r\nof a Sepoy’s sword as he stepped out of his palkee. His daughters were\r\nslain with him, save one, the youngest, who, less happy, was carried off\r\nby a native trooper to die later. In the official evidence taken long\r\nafterwards is the account given by a half-caste Christian woman. “General\r\nWheeler,” she said, “came last in a palkee. They carried him into the\r\nwater near the boat. I stood close by. He said, ‘Carry me a little\r\nfarther towards the boat.’ But a trooper said, ‘No; get out here.’ As the\r\ngeneral got out of the palkee head foremost, the trooper gave him a cut\r\nwith his sword through the neck, and he fell into the water. My son was\r\nkilled near him. I saw it, alas! alas! Some were stabbed with bayonets;\r\nothers cut down. Little infants were torn in pieces. We saw it, we did!\r\nand tell you only what we saw. Other children were stabbed and thrown\r\ninto the river. The school-girls were burnt to death. I saw their clothes\r\nand hair catch fire.”\r\n\r\nPresently the fire of the Sepoys ceased, and the wretched survivors of\r\nthe massacre—125 in number—were dragged ashore. They came stumbling up\r\nthe slope of the bank, a bedraggled company, their clothing dripping\r\nwith the water of the Ganges, or soiled with its mud. They crept up the\r\nravine down which, a brief hour before, they had walked with Hope shining\r\nbefore them. Now Grief kept pace with them; Despair went before them;\r\nDeath followed after. They had left their dead in the river behind them;\r\nthey were walking to a yet more cruel fate in front. “I saw that many of\r\nthe ladies were wounded,” said one witness afterwards; “their clothes had\r\nblood on them. Some had their dresses torn, but all had clothes. I saw\r\none or two children without clothes. There were no men in the party, but\r\nonly some boys of twelve or thirteen years of age.”\r\n\r\nThe sad company was marched back to the old cantonment, where the Nana\r\nhimself came out to exult over his victims. Lady Canning, in her journal,\r\nwrites: “There were fifteen young ladies in Cawnpore, and at first they\r\nwrote such happy letters, saying time had never been so pleasant; it was\r\nevery day like a picnic, and they hoped they would not be sent away;\r\nthey said a regiment would come, and they felt quite safe. Poor, poor\r\nthings; not one of them was saved.” How many of that girlish band of\r\nfifteen perished, with flaming hair and dress, in the boats? Or did they\r\nstrand shivering in the icy chill of terror, amongst the captives over\r\nwhom the tiger glance of Nana Sahib wandered in triumph? After being duly\r\ninspected, these poor captives were thrust into a couple of rooms in the\r\nSavada-house, and left to what reflections may be imagined.\r\n\r\nThree boats out of the forty, meanwhile, had actually got away. Two\r\ndrifted to the Oude shore, and were overtaken by instant massacre.\r\nOne boat, however, had for the moment a happier fate. It caught the\r\nmid-current of the Ganges, and went drifting downwards; and that solitary\r\ndrifting boat, without oars or rudder, bearing up in its crazy planks\r\nabove the dark waters of the Ganges the sole survivors of the heroic\r\ngarrison of Cawnpore, started on a wilder, stranger voyage than is\r\nrecorded elsewhere in all history.\r\n\r\nIt was Vibart’s boat; and by a curious chance it included in its\r\npassengers the most heroic spirits in the garrison. Moore was there, and\r\nAshe, and Delafosse; Mowbray Thomson swam out to it from his own boat,\r\nand with him Murphy, a private of the 32nd—two of the four who finally\r\nsurvived out of the whole garrison. The boat was intended to carry only\r\nfifty, but nearly a hundred fugitives were crowded within its crazy sides.\r\n\r\nA cannon-shot smashed its rudder. It had no oars nor food. From either\r\nbank a hail of shot pursued it. Every now and again the clumsy boat would\r\nground on some shallow; then, while the Sepoys shot fast and furiously, a\r\ngroup of officers would jump overboard, and push the clumsy craft afloat\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMoore, pushing at the boat in this fashion, with broken collar-bone,\r\nwas shot through the heart. Ashe and Bowden and Glanville shared the\r\nsame fate. Soon the dying and the dead on the deck of this shot-pelted\r\nboat were as many as the living. “We had no food in the boat,” wrote\r\nMowbray Thomson afterwards; “the water of the Ganges was all that passed\r\nour lips. The wounded and the dead were often entangled together in the\r\nbottom of the boat.”\r\n\r\nWhen evening came the boat ran heavily aground. Under the screen of\r\ndarkness the women and children were landed, and the boat, with great\r\neffort, floated again; the Sepoys accompanying the operation with\r\nvolleys of musketry, flights of burning arrows, and even a clumsy attempt\r\nat a fire-ship. “No one slept that night, and no one ate, for food there\r\nwas none on board.”\r\n\r\nWhen day broke the tragical voyage was continued, still to an\r\naccompaniment of musketry bullets. At two o’clock the boat stranded\r\nagain. “Major Vibart,” says Mowbray Thomson, “had been shot through one\r\narm on the preceding day. Nevertheless, he got out, and, while helping\r\nto push off the boat, was shot through the other arm. Captain Turner had\r\nboth his legs smashed, Captain Whiting was killed, Lieutenant Harrison\r\nwas shot dead.” These are sample records from that strange log.\r\n\r\nTowards evening a boat, manned by some sixty Sepoys, appeared in\r\npursuit, but it, too, ran upon a sand-bank, and this gave the sahibs\r\nan opportunity at which they leaped with fierce joy. From the sorely\r\nbattered boat, which had been pelted for nearly two days and nights\r\nwith bullets, a score of haggard and ragged figures tumbled, and came\r\nsplashing, with stern purpose, through the shallows. And then, for some\r\ntwenty breathless minutes, the Sepoys, by way of change, instead of being\r\nhunters, became the hunted, and only some half-dozen, who were good\r\nswimmers, escaped to tell their comrades what the experience was like.\r\nMowbray Thomson tells the story in disappointingly bald prose. “Instead\r\nof waiting for them to attack us,” he says, “eighteen or twenty of us\r\ncharged them, and few of their number escaped to tell the story.”\r\n\r\nNight fell black and stormy, and through falling rain and the sighing\r\ndarkness the boat, with its freight of dead and dying, drifted on. It\r\nrecalls the ship of which Tennyson sang, with its “dark freight, a\r\nvanished life.” In the morning it was found that the boat had drifted\r\ninto some backwater whence escape was impossible. The Sepoys lined the\r\nbank and fired heavily. Vibart, who was dying, but still remained the\r\nmaster spirit of the little company, ordered a sally. “Whilst there was\r\na sound arm among them that could load and fire, or thrust with the\r\nbayonet,” says Kaye, “still the great game of the English was to go\r\nto the front and smite the enemy, as a race that seldom waited to be\r\nsmitten.”\r\n\r\nMowbray Thomson and Delafosse, with some twelve men of the 82nd and\r\n34th, clambered over the side of the boat, waded ashore, and charged\r\nthe Sepoys, who fled before them. They pressed eagerly on, shooting and\r\nstabbing, but presently found new crowds of the enemy gathering in their\r\nrear. The gallant fourteen faced about, and fought their way back to\r\nwhere they had left the boat. Alas! it had vanished.\r\n\r\nThey commenced to march along the river-bank in the direction of\r\nAllahabad, with an interval of twenty paces between each man, so as\r\nto make the fire of their pursuers less deadly. Shoeless, faint with\r\nhunger, bareheaded, they fought their way for some miles. Their pursuers\r\ngrew rapidly in numbers and daring. One Englishman had fallen; the others\r\nwheeled suddenly round, and seized a small Hindu temple, determined to\r\nmake a last stand there. There was just room enough for the thirteen to\r\nstand upright in the little shrine. Their pursuers, after a few minutes’\r\nanxious pause, tried to rush the door; but, as the historian of the fight\r\nputs it, “there was no room for any of them inside”—though, as it turned\r\nout, a good deal of room was required outside for the dead bodies of\r\nthose who had made the attempt.\r\n\r\nAn effort was made to smoke out, and then to burn out, the unconquerable\r\nsahibs. When these devices failed, gunpowder was brought up, and\r\narrangements made for blowing the entire shrine, with its indomitable\r\ngarrison, into space. Seeing these preparations, the British charged out.\r\nSeven of them, who could swim, stripped themselves, and headed the sally,\r\nintending to break through to the river.\r\n\r\nSeven naked sahibs, charging through smoke and flame, with levelled\r\nbayonets, would naturally be a somewhat disquieting apparition, and the\r\nseven had no difficulty in breaking through their enemies, and reaching\r\nthe Ganges. The other six, who could not swim, ran full into the Sepoy\r\nmass, and died mute and fighting.\r\n\r\nThen commenced the pursuit of the swimmers. Two were soon shot and\r\nsank; a third, swimming on his back, and not seeing where he was going,\r\nstruck a sandspit, where some natives were waiting to beat out his\r\nbrains at leisure. There remained four—Mowbray Thomson, Delafosse, and\r\ntwo privates, a pair of strong-limbed and brave-hearted Irishmen, named\r\nMurphy and Sullivan. This heroic and much-enduring four, diving like\r\nwild ducks at the flash of hostile muskets, out-swam and out-tired their\r\npursuers. When at last they landed, they had between them “a flannel\r\nshirt, a strip of linen cloth, and five severe wounds”! They found refuge\r\nwith a friendly landowner, and reached the British lines, though Sullivan\r\ndied within a fortnight of reaching the place of safety.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what had happened to the boat after the gallant fourteen left\r\nit? Its crew consisted of little else than wounded men, dead bodies, and\r\nexhausted women and children. Upon these swooped down a great crowd of\r\nenemies. The boat was captured, and its stem promptly turned back towards\r\nCawnpore. On the morning of June 30, the boat lay again at the entrance\r\nof the fatal ghaut.\r\n\r\nIn the evidence taken long afterwards, there were brought back,\r\naccording to one native witness, sixty sahibs, twenty-five memsahibs,\r\nand four children. “The Nana ordered the sahibs to be separated from the\r\nmemsahibs, and shot. So the sahibs were seated on the ground, and two\r\ncompanies of the Nadiree Regiment stood ready to fire. Then said one\r\nof the memsahibs, the doctor’s wife (What doctor? How should I know?)\r\n‘I will not leave my husband. If he must die, I will die with him.’ So\r\nshe ran and sat down behind her husband, clasping him round the waist.\r\nDirectly she said this, the other memsahibs said, ‘We also will die with\r\nour husbands,’ and they all sat down, each with her husband. Then their\r\nhusbands said, ‘Go back,’ but they would not. Whereupon the Nana ordered\r\nhis soldiers; and they, going in, pulled them away forcibly. But they\r\ncould not pull away the doctor’s wife.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Seppings asked leave to read prayers before they died. His hands\r\nwere untied; one arm hung broken, but, standing up, he groped in his\r\npocket for a little prayer-book, and commenced to read—but what prayer\r\nor psalm, none now can tell. “After he had read,” as the witness tells\r\nthe story, “he shut the book, and the sahibs shook hands all round. Then\r\nthe Sepoys fired. One sahib rolled one way, one another as they sat.\r\nBut they were not dead, only wounded. So they went in and finished them\r\noff with swords.” When all was over, the twenty-four memsahibs, with\r\ntheir four children, were sent to swell the little crowd of captives in\r\nSavada-house. Some seventeen days of weeping life yet intervened between\r\nthem and the fatal Well.\r\n\r\nThe story of the final act in the great tragedy at Cawnpore cannot be\r\ntold without some account of events outside Cawnpore itself. A relieving\r\nforce had been organised at Calcutta, of which Neill’s Fusileers at\r\nAllahabad were the advance guard; but a leader was wanted, and on June\r\n17 Sir Patrick Grant brought Havelock, “the dust of Persia still in the\r\ncrevices of his sword-handle,” to the Governor-General, saying, “Your\r\nExcellency, I have brought you the man.”\r\n\r\nHavelock was sixty-two years of age when the great chance of his\r\nlife came to him. A little man, prim, erect, alert, quick-footed,\r\nstern-featured, with snow-white moustache and beard. Havelock, no doubt,\r\nhad his limitations. A strain of severity ran through his character.\r\n“He was always,” says one who served under him, “as sour as if he had\r\nswallowed a pint of vinegar, except when he was being shot at, and then\r\nhe was as blithe as a schoolboy out for a holiday.” There is a touch\r\nof burlesque, of course, in that sentence; but Havelock was, no doubt,\r\naustere of temper, impatient of fools, and had a will that moved to its\r\nend with something of the fiery haste and scorn of obstacles proper to a\r\ncannon-ball. He was fond, too, of making Napoleonic orations to his men,\r\nand had a high-pitched, carrying voice, which could make itself audible\r\nto a regiment. And the British soldier in fighting mood is rather apt to\r\nbe impatient of oratory.\r\n\r\nBut Havelock was a trained and scientific soldier, audacious and resolute\r\nin the highest degree; a deeply religious man, with a sense of duty of\r\nthe antique sort, that scorned ease, and reckoned life, when weighed\r\nagainst honour, as a mere grain of wind-blown dust. And Havelock,\r\nsomehow, inspired in his men a touch of that sternness of valour we\r\nassociate with Cromwell’s Ironsides.\r\n\r\nIt is curious, in view of Havelock’s achievements and after-fame, to\r\nread in the current literature of the moment, the impression he made\r\nupon hasty critics in Calcutta and elsewhere. The _Friend of India_,\r\nthe leading Calcutta journal, described him as a “fossil general”!\r\nLady Canning, in her journal, writes: “General Havelock is not in\r\nfashion. No doubt he is fussy and tiresome; but his little, old,\r\nstiff figure looks as active and fit for use as if he were made of\r\nsteel.” She again and again refers to “dear little old Havelock, with\r\nhis fussiness”—“fussiness” being in this case, little more than the\r\nimpatience of a strong will set to a great task, and fretted by threads\r\nof red tape. Lord Hardinge had said, “If India is ever in danger, let\r\nHavelock be put in command of an army, and it will be saved.” And\r\nHavelock’s after-history amply justified that prediction.\r\n\r\nHavelock had about the tiniest force that ever set forth to the task of\r\nsaving an empire. It never was able to put on the actual battlefield\r\n1500 men. There were 76 men of the Royal Artillery; less than 400 of\r\nthe Madras Fusileers; less than 300 of the 78th Highlanders; 435 men\r\nof the 64th, and 190 of the 84th, with 450 Sikhs of somewhat doubtful\r\nloyalty, and 50 native irregular horse, whose disloyalty was not in the\r\nleast doubtful. Havelock’s reliable cavalry consisted of 20 volunteers,\r\namateurs mostly, under Barrow.\r\n\r\nMeasured against the scale of modern armies, Havelock’s force seems\r\nlittle more than a corporal’s guard. But the fighting value of this\r\nlittle army was not to be measured by counting its files. “Better\r\nsoldiers,” says Archibald Forbes, “have never trod this earth.” They\r\ncommenced their march from Allahabad on July 7; they marched, and fought,\r\nand conquered under the intolerable heat of an Indian midsummer, and\r\nagainst overwhelming odds; until when, on September 19—little more than\r\neight weeks afterwards—Outram and Havelock crossed the Ganges in their\r\nadvance on Lucknow, only 250 of Havelock’s “Ironsides” were left to take\r\npart in that advance. In the whole history of the war, men have seldom\r\ndared, and endured, and achieved more than did Havelock’s column in the\r\ngallant but vain struggle to relieve Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nMaude commanded its tiny battery; Hamilton led the Highlanders;\r\nStirling the 64th; the gallant, ill-fated Renaud, the Fusileers. Stuart\r\nBeatson was Havelock’s assistant adjutant-general; Fraser Tytler was\r\nhis assistant quartermaster—general. Of the Highlanders—the Ross-shire\r\nBuff’s—Forbes says, “It was a remarkable regiment; Scottish to the\r\nbackbone; Highland to the core of its heart. Its ranks were filled with\r\nMackenzies, Macdonalds, Tullochs, Macnabs, Rosses, Gunns, and Mackays.\r\nThe Christian name of half the Grenadier company was Donald. It could\r\nglow with the Highland fervour; it could be sullen with the Highland\r\ndourness; and it may be added, it could charge with the stern and\r\nirresistible valour of the North.”\r\n\r\nWhen the little force began its march for Cawnpore, the soil was swampy\r\nwith the first furious showers of the rainy season, and in the intervals\r\nof the rain, the skies were white with the glare of an Indian sun in\r\nJuly. “For the first three days,” says Maude, “they waded in a sea of\r\nslush, knee-deep now, and now breast-high, while the flood of tropical\r\nrain beat down from overhead. As far to right and left as eye could\r\npierce extended one vast morass.” After these three days’ toil through\r\nrain and mud, the rains vanished; the sky above them became like white\r\nflame, and, till they reached Cawnpore, Havelock’s troops had to march\r\nand fight under a sun that was well-nigh as deadly as the enemy’s bullets.\r\n\r\nOn July 11 Havelock marched fifteen miles under the intolerable heat to\r\nArrapore. Camping for a few hours, he started again at midnight, picked\r\nup Renaud’s men while the stars were yet glittering in the heaven, pushed\r\nsteadily on, and at seven o’clock, after a march of sixteen miles,\r\ncamped at Belinda, four miles out of Futtehpore. The men had outmarched\r\nthe tents and baggage, and were almost exhausted. They had fallen out,\r\nand were scattered under the trees, “some rubbing melted fat on their\r\nblistered feet, others cooling their chafes in the pools; many more too\r\ndead-beaten to do anything but lie still.” It was Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there broke above the groups of tired soldiery the roar of\r\ncannon. Grape-shot swept over the camp. Over the crest and down the\r\nopposite slopes rode, with shouts and brandished tulwars, a huge mass of\r\nrebel cavalry. It was a genuine surprise! But the bugles rang out shrilly\r\nover the scattered clusters of Havelock’s men. They fell instantly into\r\nformation; skirmishers ran to the front, and the enemy’s cavalry came to\r\nan abrupt halt. It was a surprise for them, too. They had expected to see\r\nonly Renaud’s composite force—a mere handful; what they beheld instead,\r\nwas Havelock’s steady and workmanlike front.\r\n\r\nHavelock did not attack immediately. His cool judgment warned him that\r\nhis over-wearied soldiers needed rest before being flung into the fight,\r\nand orders were given for the men to lie down in rank. Presently the\r\nrebel cavalry wheeled aside, and revealed a long front of infantry,\r\nwith batteries of artillery, and the rebel general, finding the British\r\nmotionless, actually began a movement to turn their flank.\r\n\r\nThen Havelock struck, and struck swiftly and hard. Maude’s battery was\r\nsent forward. He took his pieces at a run to within 200 yards of the\r\nenemy’s front, wheeled round, and opened fire. The British infantry,\r\ncovered by a spray of skirmishers armed with Enfield rifles, swept\r\nsteadily forward. The rebel general, conspicuous on a gorgeously adorned\r\nelephant, was busy directing the movements of his force; and Maude tells\r\nthe story of how Stuart Beatson, who stood near his guns, asked him to\r\n“knock over that chap on the elephant.” “I dismounted,” says Maude, “and\r\nlaid the gun myself, a 9-pounder, at ‘line of metal’ (700 yards) range,\r\nand my first shot went in under the beast’s tail, and came out at his\r\nchest, rolling it over and giving its rider a bad fall.”\r\n\r\nIts rider, as it happened, was Tantia Topee, the Nana’s general; and had\r\nthat 9-pound ball struck him, instead of his elephant, it might have\r\nsaved the lives of the women and children in Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the 64th and the Highlanders in one resolute charge had swept\r\nover the rebel guns. Renaud, with his Fusileers, had crumpled up their\r\nflank, and the Nana’s troops, a torrent of fugitives, were in full flight\r\nto Futtehpore. The battle was practically won in ten minutes, all the\r\nrebel guns being captured—so fierce and swift was the British advance.\r\n\r\nThe rebel Sepoys knew the fighting quality of the sahibs; but now they\r\nfound a quite new fierceness in it. Havelock’s soldiers were on fire to\r\navenge a thousand murders. And, flying fast, as Trevelyan puts it, the\r\nNana’s troops “told everywhere that the sahibs had come back in strange\r\nguise; some draped like women to remind them what manner of wrong they\r\nwere sworn to requite; others, conspicuous by tall blue caps, who hit\r\ntheir mark without being seen to fire—the native description of the\r\nEnfield rifle with which the Madras Fusileers were armed.”\r\n\r\nThe fight at Futtehpore is memorable as being the first occasion on\r\nwhich British troops and the rebel Sepoys met in open battle. The Nana\r\nhad shortly before issued a proclamation announcing that the British had\r\n“all been destroyed and sent to hell by the pious and sagacious troops\r\nwho were firm to their religion”; and, as “no trace of them was left,\r\nit became the duty of all the subjects of the Government to rejoice\r\nat the delightful intelligence.” But Futtehpore showed that “all the\r\nyellow-faced and narrow-minded people” had not been “sent to hell.” They\r\nhad reappeared, indeed, with uncomfortable energy, and a disagreeable\r\ndetermination to despatch every Sepoy they could capture somewhere in\r\nthat direction!\r\n\r\nHavelock’s men had marched nineteen miles, and fought and won a great\r\nbattle, without a particle of food, and so dreadful was the heat that\r\ntwelve men died of sunstroke. Havelock camped on July 13 to give his\r\nmen rest, resumed his march on the 14th, and on the morning of the\r\n15th found the Sepoys drawn up in great strength in front of a village\r\ncalled Aong, twenty-two miles south of Cawnpore. Renaud led his Fusileers\r\nstraight at the village, and carried it with a furious bayonet charge,\r\nbut the gallant leader of the “blue caps” fell, mortally wounded, in\r\nthe charge. Maude’s guns smashed the enemy’s artillery, and when the\r\nHighlanders and the 64th were seen coming on, the Sepoys again fled.\r\n\r\nHavelock pressed steadily on, and found the Sepoys had rallied and were\r\ndrawn up in a strong position, covered by a rivulet, swollen bank-high\r\nwith recent rains, known as Pandoo Nuddee. A fine stone bridge crossed\r\nthe river; it was guarded by a 24-pound gun, a 25-pound carronade, and a\r\nstrong force of infantry. Havelock quickly developed his plan of attack.\r\nMaude raced forward with his guns, and placed them at three different\r\npoints, so as to bring a concentric fire to bear on the bridge. Maude’s\r\nfirst blast of spherical case-shell broke the sponge staves of the heavy\r\nguns in the rebel battery, and rendered them useless.\r\n\r\nThe Sepoys tried to blow up the bridge. But Maude’s fire was hot;\r\nStephenson, with his “blue caps,” was coming up at the double, and the\r\nSepoys got flurried. They had mined the bridge, and the mine was fired\r\nprematurely. The explosion shattered the parapet of the bridge, but\r\nthrough the white smoke came the Fusileers, their bayonets sparkling\r\nvengefully. The Highlanders followed eagerly in support. The bridge was\r\ncarried, the guns taken, the rebel gunners bayoneted, the rebel centre\r\npierced and broken, and the rebel army itself swept northwards, with\r\ninfinite dust and noise, in a mere tumult of panic-stricken flight.\r\n\r\nThe British camped for the night on the battlefield. At three o’clock in\r\nthe morning, with the stars sparkling keenly over their heads, and a full\r\nmoon flooding the camp with its white light, Havelock formed up his men.\r\nHe told them he had learned there were some 200 women and children still\r\nheld as prisoners in Cawnpore, the survivors of the massacre of June 27.\r\n“Think of our women and the little ones,” he said, “in the power of those\r\ndevils incarnate.” The men answered with a shout, and, without waiting\r\nfor the word of command, went “fours right,” and took the road.\r\n\r\nIt was a march of twenty miles. The sun rose and scorched the silent and\r\npanting ranks of the British with its pitiless heat. The Highlanders\r\nsuffered most; they were wholly unprepared for a summer campaign, and\r\nwere actually wearing the heavy woollen doublets intended for winter use;\r\nbut their stubborn Northern blood sustained them. Every now and again,\r\nindeed, some poor fellow in the ranks dropped as though shot through\r\nthe head, literally killed with the heat. Nana Sahib himself held the\r\napproach to Cawnpore, with 7000 troops and a powerful artillery, and his\r\nposition was found to be of great strength.\r\n\r\nHavelock studied it a few minutes with keen and soldierly glance, and\r\nformed his plans. He had the genius which can use rules, but which also,\r\non occasion, can dispense with rules. He violated all the accepted canons\r\nof war in his attack upon the Nana’s position. He amused the enemy’s\r\nfront with the fire of a company of the Fusileers, and the manœuvres of\r\nBarrow’s twenty volunteer sabres, while with his whole force he himself\r\nswept round to the right to turn the Nana’s flank. Havelock, that is,\r\nrisked his baggage and his communications, to strike a daring blow for\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nAs Havelock’s men pressed grimly forward, screened by a small grove,\r\nthey heard the bands of the Sepoy regiments playing “Auld lang syne” and\r\n“Cheer, boys, cheer,” and the sound made the men clutch their muskets\r\nwith a little touch of added fury. The Sepoys discovered Havelock’s\r\nstrategy rather late, and swung their guns round to meet it. Their fire\r\nsmote the flank of Havelock’s column cruelly, but the British never\r\npaused nor faltered. When Havelock judged his turning movement was\r\nsufficiently advanced, he wheeled the column into line. His light guns\r\nwere insufficient to beat down the fire of the heavy pieces worked by the\r\nrebels, and he launched his Highlanders at the battery. They moved dourly\r\nforward under a heavy fire, till within eighty yards of the guns. Then\r\nthe bayonets came down to the charge, and with heads bent low and kilts\r\nflying in the wind, the Highlanders went in with a run. The charge was\r\nin perfect silence, not a shot nor a shout being heard; but it was so\r\nfurious that mound and guns were carried in an instant, and the village\r\nitself swept through. As Forbes describes it, “Mad with the ardour of\r\nbattle, every drop of Highland blood afire in every vein, the Ross-shire\r\nmen crashed right through the village, and cleared it before they dropped\r\nout of the double.” They had crushed the enemy’s left, taken its guns,\r\nand sent a great mass of Sepoys whirling to the rear.\r\n\r\nBut the moment they emerged from the village, the great howitzer in\r\nthe Nana’s centre opened fire upon the Highlanders, and once more the\r\nunequal duel between bayonet and cannon had to be renewed. Havelock\r\nhimself galloped up to where the Highlanders were reforming after the\r\nconfusion and rapture of their rush, and, pointing with his sword to the\r\ngreat howitzer, pouring its red torrent of flame upon them, cried: “Now,\r\nHighlanders! another charge like that wins the day.”\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic blood was still on fire. The officers could hardly restrain\r\ntheir men till they were roughly formed. In another moment the kilts and\r\nbonnets and bayonets of the 78th were pouring in a torrent over the big\r\ngun, and the rebel centre was broken! Meanwhile the 64th and 84th had\r\nthrust roughly back Nana Sahib’s right wing; but, fighting bravely, the\r\nSepoys clung with unusual courage to a village about a mile to the rear\r\nof the position they first held, and their guns, drawn up in its front,\r\nfired fast and with deadly effect.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders, pressing on from the centre, found themselves shoulder\r\nto shoulder with the 64th, advancing from the left. Maude’s guns, with\r\nthe teams utterly exhausted, were a mile to the rear. Men were dropping\r\nfast in the British ranks, worn out with marching and charging under\r\nheat so cruel. In the smoke-blackened lines men were stumbling from very\r\nfatigue as they advanced on the quick red flashes and eddying smoke\r\nof the battery which covered the village. But Havelock, riding with\r\nthe leading files, knew the soldier’s nature “from the crown of his\r\nshako down to his ammunition boots.” “Who,” he cried, “is to take that\r\nvillage—the Highlanders or the 64th?” Both regiments had Northern blood\r\nin them—the 64th is now known as the North Staffordshire—and that sudden\r\nappeal, that pitted regiment against regiment, sent the stout Midlanders\r\nof the 64th and the hot-blooded Gaels from the clachans and glens and\r\nloch sides of Ross-shire, forward in one racing charge that carried guns\r\nand village without a check.\r\n\r\nThe battle seemed won, and Havelock, reforming his column, moved steadily\r\nforward. But the Nana was playing his last card, and his generals\r\nat least showed desperate courage. They made a third stand athwart\r\nthe Cawnpore road, and within a short distance of Cawnpore itself. A\r\n24-pounder, flanked on either side by guns of lighter calibre, covered\r\nthe Nana’s front, and his infantry, a solid mass, was drawn up behind the\r\nguns. Havelock’s men had marched twenty miles, and made a dozen desperate\r\ncharges. Their guns were far in the rear. Yet to halt was to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nHavelock allowed his men to fling themselves panting on the ground for\r\na few minutes; then, riding to the front, and turning his back to the\r\nenemy’s guns, so as to face the men, he cried in his keen, high-pitched\r\nvoice, “The longer you look at it, men, the less you will like it! The\r\nbrigade will advance—left battalion leading.”\r\n\r\nThe left battalion was the 64th. Major Stirling promptly brought forward\r\nhis leading files, and Havelock’s son and aide-de-camp galloped down,\r\nand, riding beside Stirling, shared with him the leadership of the\r\ncharge—a circumstance for which the 64th, as a matter of fact, scarcely\r\nforgave him, as they wanted no better leadership than that of their own\r\nmajor. There was less of _élan_ and dash about this charge than in the\r\nearlier charges of the day; but in steady valour it was unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nOn came the 64th, silently and coolly. Havelock himself, in a letter to\r\nhis wife, wrote with a father’s pride about his son. “I never saw so\r\nbrave a youth,” he wrote, “as the boy Harry: he placed himself opposite\r\nthe muzzle of a gun that was scattering death into the ranks of the 64th\r\nQueen’s, and led on the regiment under a shower of grape to its capture.\r\nThis finished the fight. The grape was deadly, but he calm, as if telling\r\nGeorge stories about India.”\r\n\r\nWhen the steady but shot-tormented line of the 64th found itself so near\r\nthe battery that through the whirling smoke they could see the toiling\r\ngunners and the gleam of Sepoy bayonets beyond them, then the British\r\nsoldiers made their leap. With a shout they charged on and over the guns,\r\nand through the lines behind, and Nana Sahib’s force was utterly and\r\nfinally crushed. Havelock had not a sabre to launch on the flying foe;\r\nbut his tired infantry, who had marched twenty miles, and fought without\r\npause for four hours, kept up the pursuit till the outer edge of Cawnpore\r\nwas reached. Then Havelock halted them; and, piling arms, the exhausted\r\nsoldiers dropped in sections where they stood, falling asleep on the bare\r\nground, careless of food or tents.\r\n\r\nThey were aroused long before daybreak, and through their ranks ran in\r\nwhispers the story, grim and terrible, of the massacre which, by only a\r\nfew hours, had cheated their splendid valour of its reward.\r\n\r\nHow great was the valour, how stubborn the endurance, shown thus far\r\nby Havelock’s men is not easily realised. In nine days—betwixt July\r\n7-16—they had, to quote their commander’s words “marched under the Indian\r\nsun of July 126 miles, and fought four actions.” What better proof of\r\nhardihood, valour, and discipline could be imagined? But the British\r\nsoldier is a queer compound, with very sudden and surprising alternations\r\nof virtue. When Cawnpore was won and plundered, immense stores of beer\r\nand spirits fell into the hands of the soldiers, and for a time it seemed\r\nas if Havelock’s band of heroes would dissolve into a mere ignoble gang\r\nof drunkards. Havelock promptly ordered every drinkable thing in Cawnpore\r\nto be bought or seized. “If I had not done this,” he wrote, “it would\r\nhave required one half my force to keep the other half sober, and I\r\nshould not have had a soldier in camp!”\r\n\r\nWhether the terror of Havelock’s advance on Cawnpore actually caused\r\nthe massacre of the English captives there may be doubted; it certainly\r\nhastened it. Nana Sahib, to whom murder was a luxury, would no more have\r\nspared the women and the children than a tiger would spare a lamb lying\r\nunder its paw. But even a tiger has its lazy moods, and, say, immediately\r\nafter a full meal, is temporarily careless about fresh slaughter. Nana\r\nSahib had supped full of cruelty, and was disposed, for a brief period at\r\nall events, to allow his captives to live. Moreover, some of the women\r\nin his own harem sent him word they would slay themselves and their\r\nchildren if he murdered the memsahibs and their little ones. But on the\r\nnight of July 15 the fugitives from Pandoo Nuddee reached Cawnpore,\r\namongst them being Bala Rao, the Nana’s brother and general, who brought\r\nfrom the fight a bullet in his shoulder, and a new argument for murder in\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\nIn a council held between the Nana and his chief officials that night,\r\nthe fate of the captives was discussed. Teeka Sing understood British\r\nnature so ill that he argued Havelock’s men would be robbed of their only\r\nmotive for continuing their advance on Cawnpore if the captives were\r\nslain. They might, he urged, risk the perils of a new battle for the sake\r\nof rescuing the captives, but not for the mere pleasure of burying them.\r\nThat they might have the passion to avenge them did not enter into Teeka\r\nSing’s somewhat limited intelligence. Other chiefs argued, again, that\r\nif the captives were allowed to live, they might prove very inconvenient\r\nwitnesses against a good many people.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the strongest argument on the side of murder was the\r\nmere joy of killing somebody with a white face. Havelock’s Fusileers and\r\nHighlanders declined to allow themselves to be killed; they were, in\r\nfact, slaying the Nana’s Sepoys with disconcerting fury and despatch. But\r\nthe heroes who had fled again and again before a British force one-fifth\r\ntheir number, could revenge themselves in perfect security by slaying the\r\nhelpless women and children imprisoned in the Bebeeghur. So the order for\r\nmassacre went forth.\r\n\r\nFrom July 1 the captives, 210 in number, had been crowded into a small\r\nbuilding containing two rooms, each 20 ft. by 10 ft., and an open court\r\nsome fifteen yards square. In that suffering and helpless crowd were\r\nfive men, guessed to have been Colonels Smith and Goldie, Mr. Thornhill,\r\nthe judge of Futteghur, and two others. They had neither furniture nor\r\nbedding, nor even straw, and were fed daily on a scanty ration of native\r\nbread and milk. Two of the ladies were taken across each morning to the\r\nNana’s stables, and made to grind corn at a hand-mill for hours together.\r\nThis was done, not for the sake of the scanty store of flour the poor\r\ncaptives ground out, but by way of insult. To the Eastern imagination,\r\nwhen a dead enemy’s womankind grind corn in the house of his slayer,\r\ncaptivity has reached its blackest depths. The English ladies, according\r\nto native testimony, did not object to do the work of slaves in this\r\nfashion, as it, at least, enabled them to carry back a handful of flour\r\nto their hungry little ones.\r\n\r\nSickness mercifully broke out amongst the captives, and in a week\r\neighteen women and seven children died. A native doctor kept a list of\r\nthese, and after Havelock captured Cawnpore the list was discovered.\r\nMonths afterwards there was sad joy in many an English household when,\r\non the evidence of this list, it was known that their loved ones had, in\r\nthis way, anticipated and escaped the Nana’s vengeance. One poor wife,\r\nin the sadness of that captivity, gave birth to a little one, and in the\r\nnative doctor’s list of deaths is the pathetic record—a tragedy in each\r\nsyllable—“An infant two days old.”\r\n\r\nThe evidence seems to show that during these terrible days the women\r\nwere not exposed to outrage in the ordinary sense of that word, or to\r\nmutilation, but every indignity and horror which the Hindu imagination\r\ncould plan short of that was emptied upon them, and some of the younger\r\nwomen, at least, were carried off to the harems of one or other of the\r\nNana’s generals. On the face of the earth there could have been at\r\nthe time no other scene of anguish resembling that in the crowded and\r\ndarkened rooms of the Bebeeghur, where so great a company of women and\r\nchildren, forsaken of hope, with the death of all their dearest behind\r\nthem, sat waiting for death themselves.\r\n\r\nNana Sahib was an epicure in cruelty, and was disposed to take his\r\nmurders in dainty and lingering instalments. At four o’clock on the\r\nafternoon of July 15 he sent over some of his officers to the Bebeeghur,\r\nand bade the Englishmen come forth. They came out, the two colonels, the\r\njudge, a merchant named Greenaway, and his son, and with them a sixth,\r\nan English boy, fourteen years of age, nameless now, but apparently\r\nwilling to share the perilous responsibilities of “being a man.” Poor\r\nlad! Motherless, his name all unknown, his father, perhaps, floating a\r\ndisfigured corpse on the sliding current of the muddy Ganges, he appears\r\nfor a moment, a slender, boyish figure, in the living frescoes of that\r\ngrim tragedy, and then vanishes.\r\n\r\nUnder the cool shade of a lime tree sat Nana Sahib, dark of face, gaudy\r\nof dress, and round him a cluster of his kinsmen and officers, Bala Rao\r\namong them, whose wounded shoulder was now to be avenged. Brief ceremony\r\nwas shown to this little cluster of haggard and ragged sahibs. A grim\r\nnod from the Nana, a disorderly line of Sepoys with levelled muskets and\r\nretracted lips, and the six were shot down and their bodies cast on the\r\ndusty roadside for every passer-by to spit at.\r\n\r\nA little before five o’clock a woman from the Nana’s household stepped\r\ninside the door of the Bebeeghur, and looked over the crowd of weary\r\nmothers and wan-faced children. A curious stillness fell on the little\r\ncompany, while, in careless accents, the woman gave the dreadful order:\r\nthey were “all to be killed”! One English lady, with quiet courage,\r\nstepped up to the native officer who commanded the guard, and asked “if\r\nit was true they were all to be murdered.” Even the Sepoys shrank from a\r\ncrime so strange and wanton. The officer bade the Englishwomen not to\r\nbe afraid, and the woman from the Nana’s harem was told roughly by the\r\nsoldiers that her orders would not be obeyed.\r\n\r\nIt seemed monstrous indeed that an order which was to send 200 helpless\r\nhuman beings to death should be brought, like a message about some\r\ndomestic trifle, on a servant-woman’s lips. The messenger vanished. The\r\nSepoys on guard consulted together and agreed that with their own hands,\r\nat least, they would not slay the prisoners. According to one account\r\nthey were ordered by a new messenger to fire through the windows upon the\r\ncompany of women and children, many now praying within. They obeyed the\r\norder to fire, and the sudden wave of flame and smoke, with the crash\r\nof twenty discharged muskets, swept over the heads of the captive crowd\r\nwithin. But the Sepoys, of design, fired high, and no one was wounded.\r\n\r\nWhen Havelock’s men afterwards entered those rooms, one little detail\r\nbore mute witness to the use to which some of the ladies had turned the\r\nfew minutes which followed the volley of the Sepoys. They evidently tore\r\nstrips from their dresses, and with them tried to tie the door fast; and\r\nstill those broken strips of linen and silk were hanging from the door\r\nhandles when Havelock’s men, two days afterwards, entered Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nCrime never wants instruments, and Nana Sahib soon found scoundrels\r\nwilling to carry out his orders. It was a little after five o’clock—just\r\nwhen Stephenson’s Fusileers and Hamilton’s Highlanders were sweeping over\r\nthe bridge at Pandoo Nuddee—that five men, each carrying a tulwar, walked\r\nto the door of the Bebeeghur. Two were rough peasants; two belonged to\r\nthe butcher’s caste; one wore the red uniform of the Nana’s bodyguard.\r\nThe five men entered, and the shuddering crowd of women and children was\r\nbefore them. The crowd, who watched as the door opened, saw standing\r\nerect on the threshold the English lady who had asked the native officer\r\nwhether they were all to be killed. Then the door was closed, and over\r\nthe scene that followed the horrified imagination refuses to linger.\r\n\r\nWailing, broken shrieks, the sound of running feet crept out on the\r\nshuddering air. Presently the door opened, and the man in the red uniform\r\nof the Nana’s bodyguard came out with his sword broken short off at the\r\nhilt. There were 212 to be killed, and the strain on steel blades as well\r\nas on human muscles was severe!\r\n\r\nHe borrowed a fresh sword, and went back to his work, again carefully\r\nclosing the door behind him. After a while he re-emerged once more with\r\na broken blade, and, arming himself afresh, returned a third time to\r\nhis dreadful business. It was dark when the five men—all alike now with\r\nreddened garments—came out and locked the door behind them, leaving\r\nthat great company of wives and mothers and little children in the\r\nslaughter-house. The men had done their work but roughly, and all through\r\nthe night, though no cry was heard in the Bebeeghur, yet sounds, as if\r\nsighs from dying lips, and the rustle as of struggling bodies, seemed to\r\ncreep out into the darkness incessantly through its sullen windows and\r\nhard-shut doors.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock the next morning the five men returned, attended by a\r\nfew sweepers. They opened the door, and commenced to drag the nearer\r\nbodies, by their long tresses of hair, across the courtyard to the fatal\r\nwell, hard by. Then, amongst the bodies lying prone over all the floor,\r\nthere was a sudden stir of living things. Were the dead coming back to\r\nlife?\r\n\r\nNative evidence, collected afterwards, reports that a few children and\r\nnearly a dozen women had contrived to escape death by hiding under the\r\nbodies of the slain. They had lain in that dreadful concealment all\r\nnight, but when the five returned they crept out with pitiful cries. Some\r\nof these were slain without parley; some ran like hunted animals round\r\nthe courtyard, and then threw themselves down the well. One by one the\r\nvictims were dragged out, stripped, and, many of them yet living, were\r\nflung into that dreadful grave.\r\n\r\nOne native witness, quoted by Trevelyan, says, “There was a great crowd\r\nlooking on; they were standing along the walls of the compound. They\r\nwere principally city people and villagers. Yes, there were also Sepoys.\r\nThree boys were alive. They were fair children. The eldest, I think, must\r\nhave been six or seven, and the youngest five years. They were running\r\nround the well (where else could they go to?), and there was none to save\r\nthem. No, none said a word, or tried to save them.” The youngest of these\r\nchildren, a tender little fellow, lunatic with terror, broke loose and\r\nran like a hare across the courtyard. He was captured by an unsympathetic\r\nspectator, brought back, and flung down the well.\r\n\r\nIt was two days after this, on July 17, that three men of the 78th\r\nentered the court, for Havelock was now in possession of Cawnpore, and\r\nthe Nana was a fugitive. The whispers and gestures of the natives drew\r\ntheir attention to the shut door of the bungalow. One of the Highlanders\r\npushed open the door and stepped inside. “The next moment,” to quote\r\nArchibald Forbes, “he came rushing out, his face ghastly, his hands\r\nworking convulsively, his whole aspect, as he strove in vain to gasp out\r\nsome articulate sounds, showing that he had seen some dreadful sight.” No\r\nliving thing was in the place; but the matting that covered the floor was\r\none great sponge of blood, and he who had crossed it found himself, to\r\nborrow Burns’s phrase, “red wat shod.”\r\n\r\nLittle pools of blood filled up each inequality in the rough floor.\r\nIt was strewn with pitiful relics, broken combs, pinafores, children’s\r\nshoes, little hats, the leaves of books, fragments of letters. The\r\nplastered wall was hacked with sword-cuts, “not high up, as where men had\r\nfought, but low down and about the corners, as if a creature had crouched\r\nto avoid a blow.” Long locks of hair were strewn about, severed, but not\r\nwith scissors.\r\n\r\nThere were no inscriptions on the walls, but many a pitiful record\r\nupon the scattered papers on the floor. A few childish curls marked\r\n“Ned’s hair, with love;” the fly-leaf of a Bible, with a loving\r\ninscription—giver and recipient now both dead; a prayer-book, pages\r\nsplashed red where once praying eyes had lingered. The pages of one\r\ngrimly appropriate book—Drelincourt’s “Preparation for Death”—were\r\nscattered over the whole floor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo write this story is a distress, to read it must be well-nigh an\r\nanguish. Yet we may well endure to know what our countrymen and\r\ncountrywomen have suffered. Their sufferings are part of the price at\r\nwhich a great empire has been built.\r\n\r\nInto what a passion of fury—half generous, half devilish—the soldiers\r\nwho looked on these things were kindled may well be imagined. It will be\r\nremembered that Neill compelled some of the Sepoys captured at Cawnpore,\r\nand guilty of a share in this tragedy—high-caste Brahmins—to clean up,\r\nunder the whip, a few square inches of the blood-stained floor, and\r\nthen immediately hanged them, burying them in a ditch afterwards. These\r\nBrahmins, that is, were first ceremonially defiled, and then executed.\r\nThat was an inhumanity unworthy of the English name, which Lord Clyde\r\npromptly forbade.\r\n\r\nNana Sahib had fled the palace. Principality, and power, and wealth, all\r\nhad vanished. He was, like Cain, a fugitive on the face of the earth. In\r\nwhat disguises he hid himself, through what remote and lonely regions he\r\nwandered, where he died, or how, no man knows. His name has become an\r\nexecration, his memory a horror.\r\n\r\nThe Bebeeghur has disappeared. The site where it once stood is now a\r\nbeautiful garden. In the centre of the garden, circled with a fringe of\r\never-sighing cypresses, is a low mound, with fence of open stonework. The\r\ncircular space within is sunken, and upon the centre of the sunken floor\r\nrises the figure—not too artistic, unhappily—of an angel in marble, with\r\nclasped hands and outspread wings. On the pedestal runs the inscription:\r\n“Sacred to the perpetual memory of the great company of Christian people,\r\nchiefly women and children, who, near this spot, were cruelly massacred\r\nby the followers of the rebel Nana Doondoo Punth, of Bithoor, and cast,\r\nthe dying and the dead, into the well below, on the 15th day of July\r\n1857.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLUCKNOW AND SIR HENRY LAWRENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n    And ever upon the topmost roof our banner of England flew.—TENNYSON.\r\n\r\nOn the night of May 30, 1857, the steps of the Residency at Lucknow\r\nwitnessed a strange sight. On the uppermost steps stood a group of\r\nBritish officers in uniform. Sir Henry Lawrence was there, with his\r\nstaff; Banks, the chief commissioner; Colonel Inglis, of the 32nd. The\r\nglare of a flaming house a hundred and fifty yards distant threw on the\r\ngroup a light as intense almost as noonday. Forty paces in front of the\r\ngroup stood a long line of Sepoys loading in swift silence. The light of\r\nthe flames played redly on their dark faces, on their muskets brought\r\nquickly into position for capping. For weeks the great city had been\r\ntrembling on the verge of revolt, and an officer of his staff had brought\r\nLawrence news that gun-fire that night, nine o’clock, was to be the\r\nsignal for the outbreak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR HENRY LAWRENCE\r\n\r\n_Reproduced by permission of SIR HENRY WALDEMAR LAWRENCE, from a drawing\r\nin his possession_]\r\n\r\nLawrence had taken all human precautions, and was familiar with such\r\nwarnings as that now brought to him, and he sat down with his staff to\r\ndinner with iron composure. At nine o’clock there rolled through the\r\nsultry darkness the sound of a gun, and silence fell for a moment on\r\nthe dinner party. Nothing followed the roar of the gun. Lawrence leaned\r\nforward with a smile on his face, and said to the officer who brought the\r\nnews, “Your friends are not punctual.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment there rose in sharp succession on the still night air\r\nthe crack of a dozen muskets. Then came the sound of running feet, the\r\nconfused shouts of a crowd. The Mutiny had come!\r\n\r\nLawrence, without a change of countenance, ordered the horses, waiting\r\nready saddled, to be brought round, and, followed by his staff, went\r\nout on to the Residency steps to wait for them. As they stood there red\r\nflames were breaking out at a score of points in the black mass of houses\r\non which they looked. The air was full of tumult. An English bungalow\r\nonly a hundred and fifty yards distant broke into flame, showing how near\r\nthe mutineers were.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, with the tramp of disciplined feet, a body of Sepoys came\r\nrunning up at the double out of the darkness, and swung into line facing\r\nthe Residency steps. It was the native officer bringing up the Residency\r\nguard; and, saluting Captain Wilson, Lawrence’s aide-de-camp, he asked\r\n“if the men should load.” These men were known to be disloyal; before the\r\nmorning dawned, as a matter of fact, they were in open mutiny. Ought they\r\nto be treated as loyal, and permitted to load with the entire British\r\nstaff of the city at the muzzles of their muskets? Wilson reported the\r\nnative officer’s question to Lawrence. “Yes,” said he quietly, “let them\r\nload,” and the group on the Residency steps quietly watched while ramrods\r\nrang sharply in the musket barrels, and the gun-nipples were capped. The\r\nsound of ramrods falling on the leaden bullets was perfectly audible in\r\nthe hush; and, says Colonel Wilson, “I believe Sir Henry was the only man\r\nof all that group whose heart did not beat the quicker for it.”\r\n\r\nThen there came a thrilling pause. These men had the entire British\r\nstaff at Lucknow before them at point-blank distance! A single gesture,\r\na shout, and that line of muskets would have poured its deadly fire upon\r\nthe group on the Residency steps, and with the sound of that one volley\r\nLucknow must have fallen, and perhaps the course of history been changed.\r\n\r\nThese brave men standing there under the very shadow of death knew this,\r\nand not a figure stirred! Had there been the least sign of agitation\r\nor fear, perhaps the Sepoys would have fired. But the cool, steadfast\r\nbearing of that group of Englishmen put a strange spell on the Sepoys.\r\nAnother moment of intensest strain, and the native officer gave a sharp\r\nword of command. The magic of discipline prevailed: the men swung\r\nround and marched off into the darkness. But the fate of Lucknow and a\r\nthousand British lives hung on those few critical moments. It was the\r\nhaughty, ice-cold courage of that heroic group on the Residency steps\r\nwhich, for the moment, averted a great disaster.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Lawrence is the hero of the earlier stages of the siege of\r\nLucknow, and it is difficult to imagine a loftier or more gallant\r\ncharacter. He came of that sturdy, strong-brained North of Ireland stock,\r\nwhich has given to the British Empire so many gallant soldiers and\r\nfamous administrators, so many great engineers and captains of labour.\r\nLawrence’s face, with its long features, thin-flowing beard, deep-set,\r\nmeditative, not to say dreamy eyes, and high cheek bones, was an odd\r\ncompound of, say, Don Quixote and Abraham Lincoln. His valour was “a\r\nsword of Spain, the ice-brook’s temper”; but he had better qualities\r\nthan even valour of that fine edge. He was an administrator of the\r\nfirst order. His intellect had in it a curious penetrating quality, and\r\nperhaps his brain alone forecast, in its true scale, the great Mutiny\r\nwhich shook almost to its fall the British rule in India. His courtesy,\r\nhis unselfishness, his passionate scorn of injustice, his generous pity\r\nfor the oppressed, gave a strange charm to Lawrence’s character, while\r\nhis meditative piety added gravity and depth to it. The whole interval\r\nbetween the tragedy of Cawnpore and the glory of Lucknow is to be\r\nmeasured by the single personality of Henry Lawrence. That he was of a\r\ndifferent type from Wheeler, explains how Lucknow escaped while Cawnpore\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nThe two cities are about forty-five miles distant from each other.\r\nWheeler and Lawrence had each to face, practically, the same situation,\r\nand with resources not very unequal. Wheeler’s credulous faith in his\r\nSepoys flung away the last chance of the ill-fated British in Cawnpore.\r\nIt was this which made him gather them within those thin lines of earth,\r\nshelterless from shot or sunstroke, and without supplies, where no fate\r\nexcept death or surrender was possible. Lawrence, with surer insight,\r\nmeasured the problem before him. He chose wisely the spot where the\r\nBritish must make their stand for existence. He gathered within the lines\r\nhe selected all the treasure and warlike resources of the city, with\r\nsupplies that a siege of five months did not exhaust. And his splendid\r\nforesight and energy saved Lucknow.\r\n\r\nThere is no space to tell here in detail the tale of the noble courage\r\nand energy with which Lawrence kept the seething and turbulent city from\r\nrevolt through May and June. The mere garrison figures of Lucknow show\r\nLawrence’s position. He had 700 Europeans on whom he could rely. There\r\nwere 7000 Sepoys, all potential, and highly probable mutineers. Beyond\r\nthis was a great turbulent and fanatical city, with a population of, say,\r\n700,000, a magazine waiting to explode at the touch of a match.\r\n\r\nThe peril was certain in its character, but was uncertain in scale,\r\nand time, and form. Lawrence had to arm himself against that vague,\r\nformless, yet terrific peril, without letting those who watched him\r\nclosely and keenly discover that he was conscious of its existence. He\r\nhad to hide an anxious brain behind a cheerful face; to prepare minutely\r\nfor swift-coming and desperate war, while wearing the dress, and talking\r\nthe language of peace; to turn a hospitable Residency into a fortress;\r\nand yet keep open doors and an open table. And he did it all! When, the\r\nmorning after Chinhut, the Residency was closely and furiously besieged,\r\nit was found to be provisioned, organised, and armed for a stern and\r\nobstinate and, in the end, successful defence!\r\n\r\nLawrence read the whole position of affairs so truly that his forecast\r\nof events has in it a gleam of something like prophecy, or of magic. “He\r\ntold me,” says Colonel Wilson, “that nearly the whole army would go, but\r\nnot, he thought, the Sikhs; that in every native regiment there was a\r\nresiduum of loyal Sepoys, and he meant, if possible, to retain these—as\r\nhe actually did. If Cawnpore held out, Lucknow would be unassailed; but\r\nif Cawnpore fell, Lucknow would be hard pressed, and no succour could\r\nreach the city before the middle of August; that the outbreak would\r\nremain a revolt of the Sepoys, and not a rising of the people.”\r\n\r\nLawrence’s own policy, meanwhile, was to fight for time. Every hour the\r\nMutiny could be postponed lessened its chances of success. “Time,” he\r\nwrites in his diary on May 18, “is everything just now; time, firmness,\r\npromptness, conciliation, prudence.” But Lawrence had many difficulties\r\nin carrying out that wise policy, some of them created by the divided\r\njudgments of his own staff. Mr. Gubbins, the financial commissioner, in\r\nparticular, vehemently mistrusted Lawrence’s mild handling of the Sepoys.\r\nGubbins was clever, audacious, quick-witted, fatally over-quick, perhaps,\r\nin judgment, with a gift for giving advice in confident—not to say\r\nimperious—accents, which his official superiors found somewhat trying.\r\nHe valued his own advice, too, so highly that he could not forgive the\r\ndulness in his superiors which failed to discern its excellence, or the\r\nhesitation which lingered in putting it into practice. He was perpetually\r\nurging Lawrence to disarm and expel all the native troops in Lucknow.\r\nYet Lawrence’s milder policy was justified by events. Some seven hundred\r\nSepoys remained true to their salt, and served through the great siege\r\nwith a devotion and a courage beyond praise. “Neither temptation nor\r\nthreats from their comrades without,” says Fayrer, “or hardships and\r\nprivation within, could induce them to desert. There is nothing in the\r\nhistory of the Sepoy army more creditable or honourable than their\r\nbehaviour.”\r\n\r\nLawrence had other troubles with the Europeans in Lucknow. An indiscreet\r\neditor in Lucknow published some alarmist articles of a singularly\r\nmischievous character, and Lawrence sent for him, and warned him that,\r\nif he continued to write in a fashion calculated to provoke mutiny, he\r\nwould suppress his paper. But Lawrence knew human nature too well to\r\nbelieve that mere threats would keep a foolish editor from committing\r\nfolly. A few days afterwards, happening to ride by the newspaper office,\r\nhe suddenly drew rein, and said to his staff, “Let us go in and edit the\r\npaper for Mr. ⸺.” He entered, said to the astonished editor, “Mr. ⸺, to\r\nshow you I bear no ill-will, I am come to write you a leading article;”\r\nand, sitting down, dashed off an article expounding the resources of the\r\nGovernment for meeting and putting down a revolt. The article acted as a\r\ntonic on native and European opinion in the city; but it also captured\r\nthe editor.\r\n\r\nLawrence had not a very keen sense of humour, but occasionally humour—of\r\na grim sort—broke out from him. A Hindu of some rank advised that a\r\nnumber of monkeys should be collected in the Residency, and be attended\r\nand fed by high-caste Brahmins. This would ensure the favour of all\r\nthe Hindu divinities, and would make the English popular. Lawrence\r\nlistened gravely, then said, “Your advice is good. Come,” he said,\r\nrising and taking his hat, “I will show you my monkeys.” He led the way\r\nto a battery which had just been completed; and laying his hand on an\r\n18-pounder gun, said, “See! here is one of my monkeys. That”—pointing to\r\na pile of shot—“is his food, and this”—laying his hand on the shoulder\r\nof a sentry of the 32nd, who stood at attention close by—“is the man who\r\nfeeds them. Now go and tell your friends of my monkeys!”\r\n\r\nThe serene quality of Lawrence’s courage is shown by a letter he\r\nwrites to Raikes on May 30: “We are pretty jolly ... but we are in\r\na funny position.... We are virtually besieging four regiments—in a\r\nquiet way—with 300 Europeans. I ... reside in cantonments guarded by\r\nthe gentlemen we are besieging.” That very night, as it happened, the\r\noutbreak came!\r\n\r\nOn the last day of June the disastrous fight at Chinhut brought affairs\r\nat Lucknow to a crisis. The revolted regiments from Eastern Oude were\r\nmarching on Lucknow, and Lawrence, acting on the one principle of British\r\nwar in India—of striking and never waiting to be struck—marched out to\r\ncrush the approaching mutinous regiments. His little force consisted of\r\n300 of the 32nd, 230 more or less loyal Sepoys, 36 British volunteers\r\non horseback, 120 native cavalry, and 10 guns, of which six were manned\r\nby Sepoys. There was grave doubt as to how the native artillery would\r\nbehave; but Lawrence said, “We must try and ‘blood’ them.”\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Lawrence was completely deceived as to the strength of\r\nthe enemy. He reckoned they might number 5000; they were nearer 15,000,\r\nwith not less than thirty guns. By some accident, too, the 32nd were\r\nmarched out without having broken their fast, and, marching eight miles\r\nunder the glare of an Indian sun, were exhausted before they fired a shot.\r\n\r\nThe day at Chinhut, in brief, was one of blunders and disasters.\r\n“Everything,” says Fayrer, “was against us.” The force started late, and\r\nwithout adequate preparation. The supplies of food and water never came\r\nup. The men of the 32nd had to attack when exhausted by heat, thirst, and\r\nfatigue, and want of food. The native artillerymen deserted; the Sikh\r\ncavalry fled. The one formidable gun the British had, an 8-inch howitzer,\r\nwas thrown out of action owing to the elephant that drew it taking\r\nfright. The British, in addition, were badly armed. Many of their muskets\r\nwould not go off. In the confusion of the retreat an officer called on a\r\nprivate of the 32nd by name to turn round and fire on the enemy. “I will\r\ndo so, sir, if you wish,” said the man, “but it’s no use! I have snapped\r\nsix caps already and the piece won’t go off.” The Sepoys, as it happened,\r\nwere armed with new and clean muskets.\r\n\r\nThe enormous number of the Sepoys enabled them to outflank the scanty\r\nBritish force, and nothing remained but retreat. There were many\r\nindividual acts of gallantry; but, in broken, desperately fighting\r\nclusters, the 32nd had to fall back, many of the men dropping from\r\nexhaustion or sunstroke while they tried to fight. An officer in the\r\nbattle has described the huge mass of the Sepoys as it pressed on the\r\nflank of the retreating British. “The plain,” he says, “was one moving\r\nmass of men. Regiment after regiment of the Sepoys poured steadily\r\ntowards us, the flanks covered with a foam of skirmishers. They came on\r\nin quarter-distance columns, the standards waving in their places, and\r\neverything performed as steadily as possible. A field-day on parade could\r\nnot have been better.” Under the terrific fire poured on their flank the\r\ngallant 32nd simply melted away. Their colonel, Case, a splendid soldier,\r\nfell desperately wounded, and one of the officers ran to assist him.\r\n“Your place,” Case told him, “is with your men. Never mind me. Leave me\r\nto die, but stand by your men.”\r\n\r\nLawrence rode, hat in hand, wherever the fire was fiercest, cheering\r\nthe men; but again and again he wrung his hands, and was heard to say,\r\n“My God! I have brought them to this!” A great body of native cavalry\r\nwas about to charge down on the clusters of broken red-coats, when the\r\nthirty-six volunteers on horseback rode at them with such fury that\r\nthe whole hostile mass was broken, and, with its two guns and sea of\r\nglittering sabres, was actually driven off in flight! The retreating\r\ncolumn had reached the iron bridge; the Sepoys, outnumbering them by\r\nhundreds to one, were pressing on, when Lawrence saved them by a flash\r\nof warlike genius.\r\n\r\nThe British gun ammunition was exhausted, but Lawrence ordered the empty\r\nguns to be planted across the bridge, and the gunners to stand beside\r\nthem with lighted port-fires, and before the menace of those unloaded\r\nguns the Sepoy pursuit was arrested! Out of his little European force no\r\nfewer than 112 men and five officers of the 32nd were slain. The memory\r\nof those gallant men poisoned Henry Lawrence’s dying moments. He blamed\r\nhimself because, as he said, he “had been moved by the fear of man to\r\nundertake so hazardous an enterprise.”\r\n\r\nHow darkly that night settled down on Lucknow may be imagined. The\r\nscene when the broken troops, blackened with dust, staggering with\r\nexhaustion, bloody from wounds, came streaming into the Residency, was\r\none of the wildest confusion. It seemed as if everything was lost. The\r\nvictorious Sepoys might carry the Residency with one breathless rush.\r\n“The end of all things seemed to have come,” says Dr. Fayrer—who was busy\r\ndressing wounds amid all the tumult. “The poor ladies,” he adds, “who,\r\nlike others, were anticipating immediate death, were perfectly calm,\r\nand showed great fortitude.” Lady Inglis has told how she “watched our\r\npoor soldiers returning—the most mournful sight. They were straggling\r\nin by twos and threes; some riding, some on guns, some supported by\r\ntheir comrades.” “Almost every other cavalry volunteer,” says another\r\neye-witness, “was encumbered with two, three, or even four foot-soldiers;\r\none perhaps holding his hand, another laying fast hold on the crupper, or\r\nthe tail of the horse, or the stirrup, or on all together.”\r\n\r\nLady Inglis tells the story of how the news of Colonel Case’s death was\r\nbrought to his wife. “Mrs. Case came up to me and said, ‘Oh, Mrs. Inglis,\r\ngo to bed. I have just heard that your husband and mine are both safe.’\r\nI said, ‘Why, I did not know Colonel Case went out.’ Just then John\r\n(Colonel Inglis) came in. He was crying, and after kissing me turned to\r\nMrs. Case and said, ‘Poor Case!’ Never shall I forget the cry of agony\r\nfrom the poor widow.”\r\n\r\nIt was at a crisis like this that the gallant and masterful spirit of\r\nHenry Lawrence shone out. The Sepoys had a saying that “when Lawrence\r\nSahib had looked once down to the ground, and once up to the sky, and\r\nstroked his beard, he knew what to do.” He had, that is, in an unrivalled\r\ndegree, the faculty of seeing into the heart of a difficulty, and the\r\ntwin faculty of swift decision. The disaster of Chinhut had changed\r\nthe whole situation. Lawrence had armed and garrisoned a cluster of\r\ncastellated buildings, called the Mutchee Bhawan, about a thousand yards\r\nfrom the Residency, for the purpose of over-awing the city. But his\r\nlosses at Chinhut made it difficult to hold the Residency, and impossible\r\nto hold both the Residency and the Mutchee Bhawan; and on the morning of\r\nJuly 1, from a rough semaphore on the roof of the Residency, a message\r\nwas signalled to the Mutchee Bhawan, “Retire to-night at twelve. Blow up\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\nColonel Palmer, of the 48th Native Infantry, was in command at the\r\nMutchee Bhawan; he called his officers together, and laid his plans\r\nwith perfect skill and coolness. There was a magazine consisting of 250\r\nbarrels of gunpowder and nearly 1,000,000 cartridges; these were put\r\ntogether in a huge pile; every gun that could not be carried off was\r\nspiked, and at midnight the garrison filed silently out, and the fuse\r\nwas lighted. The garrison reached the Residency gate without meeting an\r\nenemy, and just as the last man entered, with a shock as of an earthquake\r\nand a flame that for a moment lit up half the city, Mutchee Bhawan blew\r\nup. It turned out that a private of the 32nd was left drunk and sound\r\nasleep in the building. He was blown up, of course, but the next morning\r\nwas standing, stark naked, hammering at the Residency gate, shouting,\r\n“Arrah, then, open your ⸺ gates!”\r\n\r\nLawrence had thus concentrated all his force within the lines of that\r\nscanty patch of soil which was to witness a defence as heroic and\r\nstubborn as that of Saragossa against the French, or of Jerusalem\r\nagainst the Romans; and which for the next eighty-eight days—till\r\nHavelock’s Highlanders, that is, with blackened faces and crimsoned\r\nbayonets came streaming through the Bailey Guard—was to be ringed with\r\nthe fire of hostile guns.\r\n\r\nWhat was called the Residency was really an irregular cluster of houses\r\nand gardens, covering an area of about thirty-three acres, looking down\r\nfrom a slight ridge upon the river Goomtee. In the centre stood the\r\nResidency itself, a lofty three-storeyed building with many windows\r\nand wide-circling verandahs: a spacious and comfortable residence, but\r\nsingularly ill adapted for the purposes of war. The houses and gardens\r\naround it had been woven together with trenches and earthworks, with\r\nlight batteries sprinkled at regular intervals on each front, and the\r\nexternal walls of the houses along the outer fronts were pierced with\r\nloopholes. But in the whole position there was not a defence anywhere\r\nthat could resist artillery fire.\r\n\r\nThe whole position formed a rough, irregular pentagon. What may be called\r\nthe northern front looked down a gentle slope, and across a line of\r\nnative shops called the Captan Bazaar, to the river, the north-western\r\nangle being prolonged, like the horn of a rhinoceros, to include a little\r\npoint of rising ground occupied by a residence known as Innes’s house.\r\n\r\nThe exterior defence was divided into seventeen posts, each post having\r\nits commandant and its tiny garrison of soldiers or of civilians, or of\r\nthe few Sepoys still faithful to their salt. And each post had to fight,\r\nlike Hal o’ the Wynd, for “its ain hand”; to dig its own trenches, drive\r\nits own mines, make sorties on its own account, and repel assaults with\r\nits own muskets and bayonets as best it could. One man from each post\r\nwas detailed to fetch each morning provisions for the day, but, for the\r\nrest, the little cluster of smoke-blackened heroes held their post with\r\ndesperate valour on their own account, and without communication with any\r\nother post. There were no reliefs. Every man was on continuous duty day\r\nand night, and if he cast himself down for a brief and broken slumber, it\r\nwas with his musket by his side, and without undressing.\r\n\r\nInnes’s post, at the extreme north-west angle, was commanded by\r\nLieutenant Loughnan with a little garrison of clerks and men of the\r\n32nd. Next came a stretch of earthworks called the North Curtain, under\r\nColonel Palmer. The Redan, a projecting battery of three guns, was held\r\nby Lieutenant Lawrence, of the 32nd, with a few men of his regiment.\r\nThe hospital, an unsheltered post, was held by Lieutenant Langmore; the\r\nBailey Guard adjoining it by Lieutenant Aitken, with some Sepoys of\r\nthe 13th Native Infantry. The post was armed with two 9-pounders and a\r\nhowitzer, and the Sepoys regarded the tiny battery entrusted to them with\r\npeculiar pride.\r\n\r\nFollowing down the east face, Dr. Fayrer’s house was held by Captain\r\nWeston, with some Sepoy pensioners; Sago’s house was in charge of\r\nLieutenant Clery, of the 32nd, with some men of that regiment. The\r\nFinancial Commissioner’s office was held by Captain Saunders, with a\r\nmixed garrison of uncovenanted clerks and men of the 32nd; the Judicial\r\nCommissioner’s office, or Germon’s post, as it was called, was in\r\ncharge of Captain Germon, and a batch of Sepoys and clerks. Anderson’s\r\ngarrison—a two-storeyed house at the south-east angle of the position—was\r\nheld by Captain Anderson and a cluster of the 32nd, and some volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe Cawnpore battery formed the extreme east of the southern face.\r\nThis was armed with three light guns, and was so completely under the\r\nenemy’s fire that, when that fire was in full blast, no man could live\r\nbeneath it, and the commander of this post was changed every day. The\r\nSikhs’ square formed the western angle of the south front, and was held\r\nby Captain Harding, with some Sikh cavalry. Gubbins’ battery formed the\r\nsouthern extremity of the west front; it had a mixed garrison of Sepoy\r\npensioners, some men of the 32nd, and some native levies raised by Mr.\r\nGubbins. The Racket-court, the Slaughterhouse, the Sheep-pen, and the\r\nChurch formed the defences of the west front, and were held chiefly by\r\nmen of the commissariat department. The Residency itself was held by a\r\ncompany of the 84th, under Captain Lowe, as a reserve, though only once\r\nduring the siege was it called out.\r\n\r\nAbove the Residency flew, in haughty challenge to the whole world, the\r\nflag of England. That flag provoked in a quite curious degree the wrath\r\nof the mutineers. Every gun that could be brought to bear on it pelted it\r\nwith shot, and again and again the staff was carried away. But the damage\r\nwas instantly repaired, and through the whole of that desperate siege,\r\nwhile the tumult of the fight raged on every face of the entrenchments—\r\n\r\n    “Ever aloft on the palace roof the old banner of England blew!”\r\n\r\nUpon this patch of soil, a little over thirty acres in extent, ringed\r\nwith trenches and palisades, with loopholed house-walls and low\r\nearthworks, were gathered some 3000 human beings. Of these, more than\r\n600 were European women and children; nearly 700 were native servants,\r\nnon-combatants; another 700 were Sepoys, of somewhat dubious loyalty. The\r\nreal fighting strength of the garrison consisted of 535 men of the 32nd,\r\n50 of the 84th, 89 artillerymen, 100 British officers—mainly escapees\r\nfrom revolted regiments—and 153 civilians, mostly clerks, who now\r\nsuddenly had to exchange the pen for the musket and bayonet.\r\n\r\nAbout 900 British, that is, constituted the true fighting force of\r\nLucknow, and these 900 had to be distributed amongst seventeen “posts,”\r\nor batteries, and round the 2500 yards, or thereabouts, of constantly\r\nthreatened front. This gave an average of, roughly, fifty men to each\r\npost, a number, of course, which grew less every day.\r\n\r\nThe position had one remarkable feature. The Residency resembled nothing\r\nso much as a low island, set in a sea of native houses. Lawrence, with\r\nwise prevision, had attempted to clear each front of the Residency, and\r\nfrom June 12 he had some 600 workmen employed on this task. Nawabs’\r\npalaces and coolies’ huts alike were attacked with pickaxe and gunpowder;\r\nbut the undertaking was stupendous, and practically only the upper\r\nstoreys of these houses were destroyed, so that they could not sweep the\r\nBritish entrenchments with their fire. But the lower walls were left\r\nstanding, and these afforded perfect cover to the Sepoys, and enabled\r\nthem to carry on their mining operations undetected.\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern face these houses were at distances from the British\r\nentrenchments ranging from twenty-five to fifty yards; on the southern\r\nface they came up to within thirteen yards of the Residency front, an\r\ninterval, say, as wide as a city lane! So close were the two hostile\r\nlines for those eighty-eight desperate days, that the British could\r\neasily overhear the talk of the Sepoys; and when bullets ceased to fly\r\nacross the narrow space between, expletives—couched in shrill Hindu or in\r\nrough Anglo-Saxon—naturally took their place!\r\n\r\nThe strength of the mutineers was a varying and uncertain quantity.\r\nSometimes it was wildly guessed to have risen to 100,000, at other times\r\nto have sunk to 30,000. Colonel Inglis, in his official report of the\r\nsiege, after speaking of “the terrific and incessant fire day and night,”\r\nsays “there could not have been less than 8000 men firing at one time\r\ninto our position.” This describes the common experience of eighty-eight\r\ndays. And yet this great host, with all their constant tempest of fire,\r\ntheir repeated assaults, their innumerable mines, never gained a single\r\nfoot of that ground above which flew the flag of England!\r\n\r\nSir Henry Lawrence’s keen and forecasting intellect made the triumphant\r\ndefence of Lucknow possible, but in that defence he himself took the\r\nbriefest share. The siege practically began on July 1. Lawrence had taken\r\nup his quarters in a room in the Residency, which gave him a complete\r\nview of the enemy, but was also peculiarly open to their fire. On that\r\nfirst day the Sepoys threw an 8-inch shell into the room where Lawrence\r\nwas sitting, but he escaped without injury. He was entreated to change\r\nhis quarters, but answered, with a laugh, he did not think the enemy had\r\na gunner good enough to put a second shot through that same window! He\r\nwas still pressed, however, to change, and at last he consented to do so\r\n“when he had arranged for moving his papers.”\r\n\r\nAt 8 P.M. on July 2 Lawrence was lying on his bed in this room, with\r\nColonel Wilson sitting beside him writing down some instructions from\r\nhis lips. Lawrence’s nephew, George, was reclining on a bed a few feet\r\ndistant from his uncle; a coolie sat on the floor pulling the punkah.\r\nSuddenly, with a terrific rush, a second shell from that fatal howitzer\r\nbroke into the room and exploded there. As George Lawrence describes it,\r\n“There was an instant’s darkness, and a kind of red glare, and a blast\r\nas of thunder. I found myself uninjured, though covered with bricks from\r\ntop to toe.” The very clothes were torn off Wilson’s body, but he, too,\r\nwas uninjured. Lawrence was the only member of the group struck by the\r\nexploding shell, and he was mortally wounded, the whole of the lower part\r\nof his body being shattered.\r\n\r\nColonel Wilson tells graphically the story of the exploding shell, the\r\nsheet of flame, the blast of sound, the dust, the thick darkness, the\r\nstrangling smoke. He was himself thrown on the floor, and lay for a few\r\nmoments stunned. Staggering to his feet, he cried, “Sir Henry, are you\r\nhurt?” “Twice I thus called without any answer; the third time he said,\r\nin a low tone, ‘I am killed.’” When the dust cleared away, it was seen\r\nthat the coverlet on Lawrence’s bed, a moment before white, was now\r\ncrimsoned with his blood. He died on the morning of July 4, and the story\r\nof the thirty-six hours between his wound and his death is strangely\r\npathetic.\r\n\r\nFayrer, who was the resident surgeon, was brought hurriedly in, and\r\nLawrence in a whisper asked him how long he had to live. A fragment\r\nof the shell had struck the hip and comminuted the upper part of the\r\nthigh-bone. The wound was plainly fatal; and as the walls of the room\r\nin which Lawrence lay were shaking continually to the stroke of the\r\nenemy’s round-shot, the dying man was carried to the verandah of Dr.\r\nFayrer’s house, and there lay through the night, while life ebbed away.\r\nThe Sepoys, somehow, got to know that Lawrence was lying under this\r\nparticular verandah, and they turned on it what Fayrer describes as a\r\n“most fiendish fire of round-shot and musketry.” Through it all Lawrence\r\nkept the most perfect composure. He named his successor, Major Banks,\r\nand dictated exact and most luminous instructions as to the conduct of\r\nthe siege. No finer proof of his clear, tenacious, forecasting intellect\r\ncan be imagined than is supplied by the counsels which, whispered with\r\ndying breath, he gave to those on whom the responsibility of the defence\r\nmust rest. Lawrence thought of everything and foresaw everything. The\r\nwhole tactics of defence—how to keep the English members of the garrison\r\nin health, how to use the Sepoys, how to economise the provisions.\r\n“Entrench, entrench,” was the burden of his whispered counsels, urged\r\nwith dying lips. “Let every man,” he said, “die at his post, but never\r\nmake terms.” Only when he mentioned his wife’s name did his iron\r\ncomposure fail, and he wept those rare, reluctant tears which strong men\r\nknow. He wished to partake of the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. The\r\nservice was held in the open verandah, the sound of the chaplain’s voice\r\nbeing broken by the incessant crackle of hostile muskets and the crash of\r\ncannon-ball. Brave men knelt with unshamed tears by Lawrence’s bedside,\r\nand partook of the Sacrament with him.\r\n\r\nAfter it was over the dying man begged them to kiss him. The whole story,\r\nindeed, recalls that scene in the cockpit of the _Victory_, and the dying\r\nNelson’s “Kiss me, Hardy!” “Bury me,” said Lawrence, “without any fuss,\r\nand in the same grave with any men of the garrison who may die at that\r\ntime.” Then, records his biographer, “speaking rather to himself than to\r\nthose about him,” he framed his own immortal epitaph, a sentence which\r\ndeserves to be remembered as long as Nelson’s great signal itself, and\r\nwhich, indeed, has the same key-word: “Here lies Henry Lawrence, who\r\ntried to do his duty. May God have mercy on him.” It is not so well known\r\nthat Lawrence wished a verse of Scripture should be added to his epitaph.\r\nTo the chaplain, Harris, he said, “This text I should like, ‘To the Lord\r\nour God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against\r\nHim.’” “It was,” he added, with a sudden touch of loving memory, “on my\r\ndear wife’s tomb.”\r\n\r\nHe was buried at nightfall. The combat was raging fiercely along each\r\nfront of the Residency’s defences, and not an officer could follow the\r\ngeneral to his grave. Four men of the 32nd were detailed to carry his\r\nbody to its last rough resting-place. Before they lifted the couch on\r\nwhich it lay, one soldier drew down the sheet, and stooping, kissed with\r\nrough and quivering lips the dead man’s forehead, and each man of the\r\nparty followed his example. What better sign of soldierly honour could be\r\nimagined? Lawrence’s burial curiously recalls that of Sir John Moore at\r\nCorunna. He, too, was buried, according to somewhat inaccurate tradition,\r\n“darkly, at the dead of night,” and had for his requiem the thunder of\r\nthe foeman’s guns.\r\n\r\nThe story of the siege is, in the main, one of personal combats; of the\r\nduels of hostile sharpshooters; of desperate fighting underground in\r\nthe mines; of sorties by the few against the many; of the assaults of\r\nthousands repulsed by scores. As a type of the long-enduring courage with\r\nwhich individual “posts” were held may be taken the single fact that\r\nCaptain Anderson, whose residence formed what was called “Anderson’s\r\npost,” and who had a garrison of only twenty men, held his position for\r\nfive months, though a battery of nine 9-pounder guns was playing upon it\r\nalmost day and night!\r\n\r\nThe standing orders were, “Keep under cover, be always on the alert,\r\nand never fire a shot unless you can see your man.” But it was very\r\ndifficult to enforce the first clause of those instructions, at least.\r\nLady Inglis tells how she once personally remonstrated with a too daring\r\nprivate of the 32nd for exposing himself too rashly, and reminded him of\r\nthe “instructions.” “Yes,” he said, “but it’s not the way of Englishmen\r\nto fight behind walls!”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the sorties were incessant and most daring, and were\r\ncommonly got up by small independent parties, who wished to clear out a\r\nhouse held by the enemy, or silence a gun that proved too tormenting.\r\n“The local sorties,” says Innes, “were made generally by parties of not\r\nmore than half-a-dozen men.” They would choose their own leader, creep\r\nout close to the site of some hostile gun or picket, dash on it, spike\r\nthe gun, kill a few of the enemy, send the others flying, and return in\r\ntriumph!\r\n\r\nIn the more regular sorties an engineer officer and a sergeant leading\r\nwould run out, carrying a bag of gunpowder or a couple of hand grenades.\r\nIf the door of the attacked house was open, grenades were thrown in. If\r\nit were shut they drove in a bayonet, or screwed a gimlet in its wood,\r\nsuspended a bag of powder to it, and lit the fuse. The moment the crash\r\ncame the stormers charged into the building, bayoneted the Sepoys holding\r\nit, placed another bag of gunpowder on the floor, lit the fuse, and fell\r\nback, the house five minutes afterwards flying up in fragments into\r\nthe air. So expert did the men become in these house attacks that they\r\nlearned the art of always going to the right, not the left, of a doorway\r\nor passage, so that they could fire into it without exposing the whole\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThis sort of fighting naturally brought the more gallant spirits to the\r\nfront. A private of the 32nd, called Cooney, played a great part in these\r\nindependent combats. With a single comrade he charged into an enemy’s\r\nbattery, shouting, as he leaped over the ridge of earth, “Right and left,\r\nextend!” so that the Sepoys imagined a strong body was following, and\r\nfled precipitately, leaving the ingenious Cooney and his comrade to spike\r\nthe guns at leisure!\r\n\r\nCaptain Birch says: “Cooney’s exploits were marvellous. He was backed by\r\na Sepoy named Kandiel, who simply adored him. Single-handed, and without\r\nany orders, Cooney would go outside our position, and he knew more about\r\nthe enemy’s movements than anybody else. Over and over again he was put\r\ninto the guard-room for ‘disobedience of orders,’ and as often let out\r\nwhen there was fighting to be done. On one occasion, he surprised one of\r\nthe enemy’s batteries into which he crawled, followed by his faithful\r\nSepoy, bayoneting four men, and spiking the guns. He was often wounded,\r\nand several times left his bed to volunteer for a sortie.” Cooney was an\r\nIrishman, and loved fighting for its own sake. He fell in a sortie made\r\nafter Havelock’s relief.\r\n\r\nFayrer, the Residency surgeon, combined with equal energy the somewhat\r\ncontradictory duties of inflicting wounds and of healing them. He worked\r\nwith tireless energy, attending to the sick and wounded in the Residency\r\nitself. But he records, “I have constant opportunity of using my guns and\r\nrifles from the roof of my house, or from the platform in front of it.”\r\nAnd when this indefatigable doctor was not going his round among the sick\r\nand dying, he was to be found on his house-roof bringing down Sepoys with\r\nthe deadly skill he had learned in the jungle against tigers and deer.\r\n\r\nThe best shot on the British side was Lieutenant Sewell, who, happy in\r\nthe possession of a double-barrelled Enfield rifle, from a loophole on\r\nthe top of the brigade mess, which commanded a thoroughfare through the\r\nSepoy position, bagged his men as a good sportsman might bag pheasants\r\nin a crowded cover. But the Sepoys, too, had their marksmen, whose\r\naccuracy was deadly, and whose exploits won from the British garrison the\r\nnicknames of “Jim the Rifleman” and “Bob the Nailer.” “Bob the Nailer,”\r\nfrom his perch high up in what was called Johannes’ house, wrought deadly\r\nmischief. The British at last paid him the compliment of levelling a\r\nhowitzer at him, and dropping a shell into his eyrie. But shells were\r\nvain. It was discovered afterwards that “Bob the Nailer,” when he saw\r\nthat the gun was about to fire, dropped down into a sheltered room, to\r\nemerge, as soon as the shell had exploded, with his fatal rifle once more.\r\n\r\nOnce a dash was made at Johannes’ house, and its garrison slaughtered,\r\nbut “Bob the Nailer” escaped, and there was not time to blow up the\r\nhouse. Later in the siege a mine was run under his perch, and Johannes’\r\nhouse, crowded with Sepoys, with “Bob the Nailer” at its summit, was\r\nblown into space.\r\n\r\nThere were moments in the siege when, naturally, the spirits of many\r\nin the garrison sank. The children were dying from want of air, of\r\nexercise, of wholesome food. They shrank into mere wizen-faced old\r\nmen—tiny skeletons with tightened, parchment-like skin, instead of\r\nround, cherub-like faces. Scurvy tainted the blood of the unfortunate\r\ngarrison. Sleeplessness and the ever-present atmosphere of danger\r\nshook their nerves. Men stole out day after day, at the risk of their\r\nlives, to gather the leaves of a cruciferous plant, whose green leaves,\r\nunscorched by the flame of powder, could be seen amongst the ruins. A\r\nrank and dreadful stench of decaying bodies hung over the shot-tormented\r\nResidency, and poisoned the very air. Lady Inglis tells how the ladies\r\nheld rueful debate among themselves as to the lawfulness of taking their\r\nown lives if the Residency fell.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Sepoys within the Residency, again, as the few weeks grew\r\ninto months and no relief came, there spread a conviction that the fate\r\nof the sahibs was sealed, and there were many desertions. Sixteen went\r\noff in a body one night, headed by a Eurasian with the very British name\r\nof “Jones.” They left the post they held open to the enemy, and scribbled\r\non the walls in several places the explanation, “Because we have no\r\nopium.” Jones and his fellow-deserters, it is not unsatisfactory to know,\r\nwere shot by the Sepoys.\r\n\r\nOne of the ugly features of the siege was that several European\r\nrenegades—amongst them at least one Englishman—were fighting on the side\r\nof the mutineers. Rees says that at the battle of Chinhut a European—“a\r\nhandsome-looking man, well built, fair, about twenty-five years of age,\r\nwith light moustache, and wearing the undress uniform of a European\r\ncavalry officer”—headed a cavalry charge on the men of the 32nd. He\r\nmight have been a Russian, but was vehemently suspected of being an\r\nEnglishman, who had forsaken both his faith and his race. His name was\r\neven whispered, and Rees adds that he was of good family. Two of his\r\ncousins were fighting valiantly in the Residency against the rebels, a\r\nthird was wounded at Agra, a fourth held a high military appointment.\r\nYet this apostate was recognised laying a gun against the Residency! His\r\nshrift would have been particularly short had he fallen into British\r\nhands. The British privates in the Residency, too, were kindled to\r\na yet higher temperature of wrath by hearing the bands of the Sepoy\r\nregiments playing—as if in irony—“God save the Queen” under the shelter\r\nof the ruined buildings that came almost up to the line of the British\r\nentrenchments.\r\n\r\nBut on the whole the average Briton is apt to be grimly cheerful when a\r\ngood fight is in progress, and even this dreadful siege was not without\r\nits humours. Thus Rees tells how, on the night of July 26, the men of\r\nhis post were spreading themselves out in the chorus of “Cheer, Boys,\r\ncheer,” with the utmost strength of their voices, when an alarm was given\r\nat the front. They dashed out, and, with the unfinished syllables of that\r\nchorus yet on their lips, found themselves in the tumult and fury of a\r\ndesperate assault. After the fight was over they returned and finished\r\ntheir interrupted song!\r\n\r\nInnes, again, relates how, when a long mine of the enemy had been seized,\r\nand two officers were exploring its darkness, they heard the earth fall\r\nin behind them. One of the two, famous for his resonant laugh, shouted\r\nwith a burst of merriment, “What fun! They are cutting us off,” and\r\nturned round gaily to charge on his foes!\r\n\r\nDanger, in a word, had become an inspiring jest to these brave spirits.\r\n“Sam” Lawrence, who commanded the Redan, was famous for the cheerful\r\nview he always took of affairs. It was known that the Sepoys had several\r\nmines converging on the projecting horn of the Redan, and Lawrence, as\r\nunconquerably jolly as Mark Tapley himself, expressed his view of the\r\nsituation to his brigadier by saying, with a laugh, that “he and his men\r\nexpected very shortly to be up amongst the little birds!”\r\n\r\nOn June 14, Fayrer records, “If we can believe our enemies, we are the\r\nlast Englishmen in the country.” This might or might not be the case;\r\nbut the garrison determined grimly that, if they were the last of their\r\nrace, they would not disgrace it. In the vernacular of the camp, they had\r\nagreed to “blow the whole ⸺ thing into the air” rather than surrender. “I\r\nwas quite determined,” says Fayrer, “that they should not take me alive,\r\nand I would kill as many of them as I could before they took me.... Some\r\nmen asked me to give them poison for their wives, if the enemy should get\r\nin. But this I absolutely refused to do.”\r\n\r\nCourage, when high-strung, sometimes evolves an almost uncanny\r\ncheerfulness. The Sepoys brought a mortar into action that dropped\r\nshell after shell on one particular house. “We got the ladies up out of\r\nthe Tyekhana,” records Fayrer, and they amused themselves by trying to\r\nbe cheerful and singing part-songs in the portico, to the rushing of\r\nshells and the whistling of musket-balls. When before were such songs\r\nattempted to such an accompaniment? But the women of the Residency\r\nshowed throughout a courage quite as high as that of the men. During\r\nthe great assault on July 20, when, on the explosion of a mine, the\r\nSepoys attempted to storm the Residency at half-a-dozen points, “every\r\none,” says Fayrer, “was at his post, and poured shot, shell, grape, and\r\nmusketry into them as hard as possible. The noise was frightful, the\r\nenemy shouting and urging each other on. It certainly seemed to me as if\r\nour time had come. But all the poor ladies were patiently awaiting the\r\nresult in the Tyekhana.”\r\n\r\n“During the whole siege,” says Gubbins, “I never heard of a man among\r\nthe Europeans who played the coward. Some croaked, no doubt, many were\r\ndespondent, yet others grew grimly desperate during those terrible days.”\r\nGubbins relates how he was one evening taken aside by an officer, who\r\nexplained that he had arranged with his wife that, if the Sepoys forced\r\ntheir way in, he would shoot her. “She had declared herself content to\r\ndie by a pistol-ball from his hand.” He offered to do the same friendly\r\nservice for Gubbins’s wife, if necessary, and wanted Gubbins to undertake\r\na like desperate office for his wife, if required. To such desperate\r\nstraits were civilised and Christian men driven!\r\n\r\nThe courage shown by the women was uniform and wonderful. Dr. Fayrer\r\nrelates how a shell broke in the bedroom where his wife was lying. It\r\nshattered the room and set fire to the bedclothes with its explosion.\r\nFayrer ran in; and, he says, “My wife immediately spoke to me out of\r\nthe smoke, and said she was not hurt. She was perfectly composed and\r\ntranquil, though a 9-pound bombshell had just burst by the side of her\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\nThere were three great all-round attacks, on July 20, August 10, and\r\nSeptember 5. The most desperate, perhaps, was that on the Cawnpore\r\nbattery, the most nearly successful that on the Sikh square. The attack\r\non the Sikh square was preceded by the explosion of a mine which made a\r\nbreach thirty feet wide in the British defences, and buried seven of its\r\ndefenders under the ruins. There was good cover for the enemy close up\r\nto the breach, and no reason why they should not have swarmed in, except\r\nthe argument of the smoke-blackened, grim-looking sahibs who suddenly\r\nappeared, musket in hand, to guard the great gap.\r\n\r\nA rush was, indeed, made by the Sepoys, and a native officer of the\r\nIrregular Cavalry, who headed the rush gallantly enough, actually crossed\r\nthe line of the entrenchments—the only mutineer who, during the long\r\nsiege, succeeded in putting his foot on the soil held by the British. He\r\nwas instantly shot, and so cruel and swift was the fire poured in upon\r\nthe Sepoys that they fell back in confusion, and under Inglis’s orders\r\nplanks and doors were brought quickly up, and arranged, one overlapping\r\nthe other, till the whole gap was covered, and a pile of sand-bags built\r\nbehind it.\r\n\r\nGubbins describes one critical moment in the siege. On July 21st it was\r\ndiscovered the Sepoys had dug through an adjoining wall and found their\r\nway into a narrow lane which skirted the compound; and, literally, only\r\na canvas screen parted them from the British position! Gubbins ran to\r\nthe single loophole which commanded the lane, and, with his rifle, shot\r\ndown every Sepoy who attempted to cross it while the gap in the British\r\ndefences was being hurriedly built up. “At this moment,” he says, “I\r\nheard the voice of a European behind me, and, without turning my head,\r\nbegged that the wall in the rear of the mutineers might be loopholed and\r\nmusketry opened upon them. The person behind me, it seems, was Major\r\nBanks. He approached my post to get a sight of the enemy, and while\r\nlooking out incautiously received a bullet through the temples. I heard\r\nthe heavy fall, and turned for a second. He was dead. He never moved, and\r\nI resumed my guard over the enemy.” For two stern hours Gubbins guarded\r\nthe gap. Then assistance came, the Sepoys were driven from their point of\r\nvantage, and the gap in the defences built up.\r\n\r\nLater on in the siege the fighting was carried on beneath the surface\r\nof the earth. The Sepoys had amongst them many men belonging to a caste\r\nfamous for skill with the spade, and from more than a score of separate\r\npoints they drove mines towards the entrenchments. Spade had to fight\r\nspade; and, as in the 32nd were many Cornishmen familiar with mining\r\nwork, these were employed to countermine the enemy. The Sepoys undertook\r\n37 separate mines, and of these 36 were failures, only one—that directed\r\nagainst the Sikh square—proving successful.\r\n\r\nOne of the most heroic figures in the immortal garrison was Captain\r\nFulton, the garrison engineer, who, on the death of Major Anderson, took\r\ncharge of all engineering operations. Fulton was a superb engineer, and\r\nall the stories of the siege do justice to the part he played in the\r\ndefence. Gubbins says he was “the life and soul of everything that was\r\npersevering, chivalrous, and daring,” and declares that he deserved to be\r\ncalled “the Defender of Lucknow.” Mr. Fulton, of Melbourne, a relation\r\nof this brave man, still preserves the journal of the siege kept by\r\nhis kinsman. It is a document of real historical value, and gives a\r\ngraphic picture of the great struggle from day to day. He tells again\r\nand again how he met the enemy’s mines by countermines, how he broke in\r\nupon them, swept them from their drive like flying rabbits, and blew the\r\nwhole affair up, as he puts it, “with great enjoyment of the fun and\r\nexcitement!”\r\n\r\nFulton once found that they had driven a mine close up to the wall of\r\na house that formed part of the British defence, and he could hear the\r\nsound of pick and shovel distinctly. “I thought this very impudent,”\r\nhe writes; “they could be so easily met; but it seemed a bore to begin\r\nto counter. So I just put my head over the wall and called out in\r\nHindustanee a trifle of abuse and ‘Bagho! bagho!’—‘Fly! fly!’—when such\r\na scuffle and bolt took place I could not leave for half-an-hour for\r\nlaughing. They dropped it for good—that was the best of the joke.”\r\n\r\nFulton took his full part in the general fighting. Thus, in the assault\r\non the Cawnpore battery, he relates that he “found the enemy led by a\r\nman in pink, whom I had noticed several times directing them as they\r\ncame up. I put a rifle-ball through him, and then sent Tulloch to order\r\nhand-grenades, the second of which, well thrown, cleared the ditch.” Here\r\nis a picture, again, of one of Fulton’s many sorties to destroy houses by\r\nwhich the British were annoyed:\r\n\r\n    We sneaked out of our lines into a house. I had only a\r\n    penknife, slow match, and port-fire in my hand, and was\r\n    followed close by two Europeans, and supported by a dozen\r\n    more. We expected to find the house empty, but George\r\n    Hutchinson, who was first, suddenly startled us by firing his\r\n    revolver and calling out “Here are twenty of them!” The two\r\n    Europeans—indeed, all of them—fell back a pace or two; but I\r\n    seized a musket from one, and ran forward. They followed, and I\r\n    put them in position to guard doors, while I twitted the enemy\r\n    with not showing their faces, as I did, in front of the door,\r\n    but standing with only their firelocks showing. The chaff had\r\n    the effect, for one dashed out and fired at me, but I shot him\r\n    instanter. They then bolted as I gave the word “Charge!” and we\r\n    blew up the house. Great fun and excitement in a small way!\r\n\r\nFulton detected a mine the enemy had driven a certain distance; he ran\r\na short countermine to meet it, and then sat patiently, revolver in\r\nhand, waiting for the unconscious enemy to break through. “Some one,”\r\nhe relates, “looking for me, asked one of the Europeans if I was in the\r\nmine. ‘Yes, sir!’ said the sergeant, ‘there he has been for the last two\r\nhours, like a terrier at a rat-hole, and not likely to leave it either\r\nall day!’” It was to the energy, skill, and daring of this gallant\r\nofficer that the complete defeat of the enemy’s mines was due.\r\n\r\nThe last entry in his journal is dated September 11; on September 13 he\r\nwas killed. Says Captain Birch, “The death of this brilliant officer was\r\noccasioned by one of the most curious of wounds. He had been inspecting\r\na new battery in an earthwork opposite Mr. Gubbins’s house. He was lying\r\nat full length in one of the embrasures, with a telescope in his hand. He\r\nturned his face, with a smile on it, and said: ‘They are just going to\r\nfire,’ and sure enough they did! The shot took away the whole of the back\r\nof Captain Fulton’s head, leaving his face like a mask still on his neck.\r\nWhen he was laid out on his back on a bed, we could not see how he had\r\nbeen killed. His was the most important loss we had sustained after that\r\nof Sir Henry Lawrence.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SIR HENRY HAVELOCK, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n_From an engraving_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nLUCKNOW AND HAVELOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nLucknow is only forty-five miles from Cawnpore. On July 25, Havelock,\r\nat the head of his tiny but gallant force, by this time tempered in the\r\nflame of battle to the quality of mere steel, crossed the Ganges in\r\na tempest of rain, and started to rescue the beleaguered garrison of\r\nLucknow from the fate of Cawnpore. But it was not until September 25 that\r\nOutram and Havelock clambered through the shot-battered gun embrasure in\r\nthe low wall beside the Bailey Guard at Lucknow, and brought relief to\r\nthe hard-pressed garrison. And the story of those nine weeks is scribbled\r\nover with records of daring and of achievement unsurpassed in the history\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nHavelock left 300 men under Neill to hold Cawnpore, where rough but\r\nadequate entrenchments had been thrown up. Furious rains had swollen the\r\nGanges, and it took him four days to transport his little force across\r\nits turbid and far-extended waters. He had under his command Neill’s\r\n“blue-caps,” the 64th, the 84th, the 78th, and Brasyer’s Sikhs, a force\r\nnot quite 1500 strong—of which only 1200 were British—with ten small\r\nfield-pieces and a troop of sixty horsemen. And with this mere handful of\r\nmen a dozen strong positions had to be carried, a great river crossed,\r\nand a huge city, swarming with enemies, pierced!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCKNOW 1857.\r\n\r\nWalker & Cockerell sc.]\r\n\r\nThe village of Onao barred the road, some nine miles from the banks of\r\nthe Ganges. Every house was held by Oude irregulars, a stubborn and\r\nhard-fighting race; the rain-water, lying deep on both flanks of the\r\nvillage, made a turning movement impossible. The infantry had outmarched\r\nthe guns, and Havelock wished to keep them back till his artillery came\r\nup.\r\n\r\nBut the men were fiercely impatient, and could hardly be restrained.\r\n“Pray, sir,” urged Colonel Hamilton, of the 78th, “let them go at\r\nthe place and have done with it.” Havelock nodded, and in an instant\r\nHighlanders and Fusileers, vehemently racing against each other, went at\r\na run into the village. Every house was a loopholed fortress, and the\r\nfighting was stubborn and deadly. House after house broke into flames,\r\nwhile clusters of Highlanders and Fusileers broke through doors and\r\nwindows. The Oude men, to quote Forbes’s phrase, “fought like wild cats\r\nwhile they roasted.” The 64th next came up at the double, and the village\r\nwas carried.\r\n\r\nBeyond the village the flying guns of the enemy halted, and drew up\r\nacross the narrow causeway, barring it with a fiery hedge of shot and\r\nflame; but the “blue-caps,” their officers leading, swept like a human\r\nwhirlwind down on the guns, and the stubborn Oude gunners, to a man, were\r\nbayoneted at their pieces.\r\n\r\nSix miles further the walled town of Bussarat Gunj crossed the road, its\r\ngateway spanning the whole width of the causeway. Havelock took his guns\r\nwithin short range of the gateway, and commenced to batter it, whilst\r\nhe despatched the 64th to turn the town and cut off the retreat of the\r\nenemy. It was clever strategy, but the 78th and the Fusileers were too\r\nquick, the 64th too slow. Highlanders and “blue-caps” carried trench,\r\ngateway, and battery with one sustained and angry rush, and as they came\r\nstorming through the gateway with bent heads and bayonets at the charge,\r\nthe enemy were driven, a jumble of flying horsemen, galloping artillery,\r\nand wrecked infantry, through the town beyond it. The 64th, it is said,\r\nmarched reluctantly on their turning movement. The men were eager to\r\nshare the straight rush at the gate.\r\n\r\nYoung Havelock, mistaking the men’s temper, galloped up to the\r\nregiment with a message from his impatient father that lost nothing in\r\ncarrying—“If you don’t go at the village I’ll send men that will go, and\r\nput an everlasting disgrace on you!” Brave men do not lightly endure\r\nthe whip of a message like that, and Forbes relates how a private named\r\nPaddy Cavanagh leaped from the ranks, ran single-handed in on the enemy,\r\n“cursing his comrades with bitter Irish malisons as he sped, and was\r\nliterally hacked to pieces, fighting like a wild cat in the ranks of his\r\nenemies”! How the 64th followed where valiant Paddy Cavanagh had led may\r\nbe imagined; but the late arrival of the 64th had spoiled Havelock’s\r\ncombination, and he was too much given to vehement rhetoric to spare the\r\nheavy-footed 64th a lash of the whip. “Some of you,” he said in his order\r\nof the day next morning, “fought yesterday as if the cholera had seized\r\nyour mind as well as your bodies!”\r\n\r\nHavelock had by this time marched fifteen miles, fought two battles,\r\nused up one-third of his ammunition, and lost by bullet or cholera\r\nabout one-sixth of his force. At this rate of progress he would reach\r\nLucknow with powderless guns and 600 bayonets! Cawnpore itself, too, was\r\nthreatened, and at Dinapore, a vital point in the long water-line between\r\nCalcutta and Allahabad, three regiments of Sepoys had broken into mutiny,\r\nand threatened Havelock’s communications with the capital.\r\n\r\nHavelock consulted with Tytler, his quartermaster-general, his chief\r\nengineer, and his son. Young Havelock, with the effervescing and heady\r\nvalour of youth, was for “pushing on at all hazards”; the older men\r\ndeclared this meant the entire destruction of the force, and perhaps the\r\nloss of Lucknow, and Havelock was too good a soldier not to agree with\r\nthis view. It was an act of nobler courage to fall back than to advance,\r\nbut Havelock’s fine-tempered valour was equal to the feat, and he turned\r\nthe faces of his reluctant soldiers back to Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nNeill, fierce and vehement by nature, when he heard the news, despatched\r\nan amazing letter to his chief.\r\n\r\n“You ought not to remain a day where you are,” he wrote. “You talk of\r\nadvancing as soon as reinforcements reach you. You ought to advance\r\nagain, and not halt until you have rescued, if possible, the garrison of\r\nLucknow.” Havelock, with that note of shrill temper which ran through his\r\ncharacter, was the last man to endure exhortations of this peremptory\r\nquality from a subordinate. “There must be an end,” he wrote back, “to\r\nthese proceedings at once.” Nothing, he said, but the possible injury\r\nto the public service prevented him from putting Neill under immediate\r\narrest! “But,” he added, “you now stand warned. Attempt no further\r\ndictation!”\r\n\r\nThe truth is, both men were splendid soldiers, but of a type so different\r\nthat neither could understand the other. Neill was of the silent, dour\r\ntype; Havelock was too shrill and vocal for him. Havelock, on the other\r\nhand, often felt Neill’s stern silence to be an unsyllabled reproof, and\r\nhe more than suspected Neill of the desire to overbear him. When Neill\r\njoined him at Cawnpore, Havelock’s first words to him were, “Now, General\r\nNeill, let us understand each other. You have no power or authority\r\nhere whilst I am here, and you are not to issue a single order here.”\r\nThere were the elements of a very pretty quarrel betwixt the two soldiers\r\nwho were upholding the flag of England at the heart of the Mutiny; and\r\nyet, so essentially noble were both men, and so fine was their common\r\nstandard of soldierly duty, that they laid aside their personal quarrel\r\nabsolutely, and stood by each other with flawless loyalty till, under the\r\nfatal archway at the Kaisarbagh, Neill fell, shot through the head.\r\n\r\nHavelock telegraphed to Calcutta that he could not resume his march\r\nto Lucknow till he had been reinforced by 1000 infantry and Olpherts’\r\nbattery complete. Yet on August 4, when he had been reinforced by merely\r\na single company and two guns, he started afresh for Lucknow, won\r\nanother costly victory at Bussarat Gunj, and then fell back once more\r\non Cawnpore, with cholera raging amongst his men. Almost every fourth\r\nBritish soldier under his command was disabled either by sickness or\r\nwounds. Havelock had simply to wait till reinforcements came up; but he\r\nrelieved his feelings while he waited by marching out and destroying\r\nBithoor, Nana Sahib’s palace.\r\n\r\nThe days crept past leaden-footed; reinforcements trickled in, so to\r\nspeak, drop by drop. Not till September 16 was Havelock ready for the\r\nfinal march to Lucknow. And then Outram arrived to supersede him! It\r\nwas, in a sense, a cruel stroke to Havelock. But he and Outram were tried\r\ncomrades, knitted to each other by a friendship woven of the memories\r\nand companionship of many years, and Outram was himself one of the most\r\nchivalrous and self-effacing men that ever lived. The story of how he\r\nrefused to take the command out of Havelock’s hands, confined himself to\r\nhis civil office as commissioner, and put himself, as a mere volunteer,\r\nunder Havelock’s orders, is an oft-told and most noble tale.\r\n\r\nOn September 19 Havelock crossed the Ganges, by this time bridged,\r\nwith a force numbering 3000 men of all arms. The Madras Fusileers, the\r\n5 th Fusileers, the 84th, and two companies of the 64th, under Neill,\r\nformed the first brigade. The second brigade, under Colonel Hamilton,\r\nconsisted of the 78th Highlanders, the 90th, and Brasyer’s Sikhs. The\r\nartillery consisted of three batteries, under Maude, Olpherts, and Eyre\r\nrespectively; and no guns that ever burned powder did more gallant and\r\ndesperate service than these. The pieces, indeed, might well have been\r\nstored, as heroic relics, in some great museum. The cavalry was made up\r\nof 109 volunteers and 59 native horsemen, under Barrow.\r\n\r\nThe rain fell as though another Noachian deluge was imminent. The\r\nrice-fields on either side of the road were either lakes or quagmires.\r\nThe column, however, pushed on with eager and cheerful, if wet-footed,\r\ncourage. The Sepoys held the village of Mungulwagh strongly. Havelock\r\nsmote them in front with his artillery, turned their flank with his\r\ninfantry, marching—or rather splashing—through the swamps, and when the\r\nSepoys had been, in this manner, hustled out of the town, he launched\r\nhis little squadron of cavalry upon them. Outram rode among the troopers\r\narmed with nothing but a gold-mounted cane, with which he thumped the\r\nheads and shoulders of the flying enemy.\r\n\r\nHere some mutineers, stained with special crimes, fell into Havelock’s\r\nhands, and Maude, in his “Memories of the Mutiny,” tells how Havelock\r\nasked him “if he knew how to blow a man from a gun.” This art does not\r\nform part of the curriculum at Woolwich, but Maude could only touch his\r\ncap and say he “would try.” Here is a grim picture of the doings of that\r\nstern time:—\r\n\r\n    When we halted for the night, I moved one of my guns on to the\r\n    causeway, unlimbered it, and brought it into “action front.”\r\n    The evening was just beginning to grow dusk, and the enemy\r\n    were still in sight, on the crest of some rising ground a few\r\n    hundred yards distant. The remainder of my guns were “parked”\r\n    in a nice mango-tope to the right of the road.... The first man\r\n    led out was a fine-looking young Sepoy, with good features,\r\n    and a bold, resolute expression. He begged that he might not\r\n    be bound, but this could not be allowed, and I had his wrists\r\n    tied tightly each to the upper part of a wheel of the gun. Then\r\n    I depressed the muzzle, until it pointed to the pit of his\r\n    stomach, just below the sternum. We put no shot in, and I only\r\n    kept one gunner (besides the “firing” number) near the gun,\r\n    standing myself about 10 ft. to the left rear. The young Sepoy\r\n    looked undauntedly at us during the whole process of pinioning;\r\n    indeed, he never flinched for a moment. Then I ordered the\r\n    port-fire to be lighted, and gave the word “Fire!” There was a\r\n    considerable recoil from the gun, and a thick cloud of smoke\r\n    hung over us. As this cleared away, we saw two legs lying in\r\n    front of the gun, but no other sign of what had, just before,\r\n    been a human being and a brave man. At this moment, perhaps\r\n    from six to eight seconds after the explosion, down fell the\r\n    man’s head among us, slightly blackened, but otherwise scarcely\r\n    changed. It must have gone straight up into the air, probably\r\n    about 200 feet.\r\n\r\nThis was stern, uncanny occupation for a humane-minded British officer!\r\nBut the times were stern, the crisis supreme.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the second day’s march the air was full of a faint,\r\nfar-off, vibrating sound. It was the distant roar of the enemy’s cannon\r\nbreaking like some angry and dreadful sea on the besieged Residency!\r\nWhen the camp was pitched Havelock fired a royal salute, hoping the\r\nsound would reach the ears of the beleaguered garrison, and tell them\r\nrescue was coming; but the faint wind failed to carry the sound to the\r\nResidency. When the soldiers began their march on September 23, Lucknow\r\nwas only sixteen miles distant, and by noon the Alumbagh was in sight,\r\nheld by a force of some 12,000 men.\r\n\r\nHavelock turned the enemy’s right with his second brigade, while he\r\nengaged the enemy’s guns with Eyre’s battery in front. Olpherts, with his\r\nguns, was sent to assist the turning movement. Here is a stirring battle\r\npicture drawn by Forbes:—\r\n\r\n    At a stretching gallop, with some volunteer cavalry in front\r\n    of it, the horse battery dashed up the road past the halted\r\n    first brigade, which cheered loudly as the cannon swept by,\r\n    Neill waving his cap and leading the cheering. On the left of\r\n    the road there was a great deep trench full of water, which\r\n    had somehow to be crossed. Led by Barrow, the cavalry escort\r\n    plunged in, and scrambled through, and then halted to watch\r\n    how Olpherts would conquer the obstacle. “Hell-fire Jack” was\r\n    quite equal to the occasion, and his men were as reckless as\r\n    himself. With no abatement of speed the guns were galloped into\r\n    the great trough. For a moment there was chaos—a wild medley of\r\n    detachments, drivers, guns, struggling horses, and splashing\r\n    water; and then the guns were out on the further side, nobody\r\n    and nothing the worse for the scramble, all hands on the alert\r\n    to obey Olpherts’ stentorian shout, “Forward at a gallop!”\r\n\r\nHamilton’s men marched and fought knee-deep in water; but the enemy’s\r\nright was smashed, his centre tumbled into ruin, and the men of the\r\n78th and the Fusileers actually carried the Alumbagh in ten minutes! To\r\ntumble 12,000 men into flight, and carry the Alumbagh in this fashion,\r\nand in a space so brief, was a great feat; and while the men were\r\nin the exultation of victory, a messenger came riding in with the\r\nnews—unhappily not true—that Delhi had fallen!\r\n\r\nOn the 24th the little force rested, while its leaders matured their\r\nplans for the advance to the Residency. Before them ran the great canal,\r\nthe road crossing it by what was called the Charbagh bridge. Havelock’s\r\nplan was to bridge the Goomtee, the river into which the canal ran, march\r\nalong its further bank, round the city to its north-west angle, and\r\nre-cross by the iron bridge immediately in front of the Residency, and\r\nin this way avoid the necessity of forcing his way, with desperate and\r\nbloody street-fighting, through the interlaced and tangled lanes of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nBut the soil between the canal and the river was little better than a\r\nmarsh, and it was determined to force the Charbagh bridge, advance on a\r\nlane which skirted the left bank of the canal, then turn sharply to the\r\nleft, and fight a way across the city to the Residency.\r\n\r\nThree hundred footsore and sick men were left to hold the Alumbagh. In\r\nthe grey dawn of September 25, Havelock’s men, scanty in number, worn\r\nwith marching, and hardened with a score of fights, were falling into\r\nline for the final march, which was to relieve Lucknow. “The sergeants of\r\ncompanies,” says an eye-witness, “acting on their orders, were shouting\r\n‘Fall out, all you men that are footsore or sick;’ but many added the\r\ntaunt, ‘and all you fellows whose heart isn’t good as well!’” But no man\r\nfell out of the ranks that grey September morning on that coward’s plea!\r\nAt half-past eight the bugles sang out the advance, and with a cheer, and\r\na quick step which the officers could scarcely restrain from breaking\r\ninto the double, the men moved off for the last act in this great\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nMaude’s guns moved first, covered by two companies of the 5th\r\n(Northumberland) Fusileers. Outram rode by Maude’s side with the leading\r\ngun. Instantly, from a wide front, a cruel and deadly fire smote the\r\nhead of the little column. From the enemy’s batteries on either flank,\r\ncarefully laid and admirably served, from the cornfields, from the garden\r\nwalls, from the house-roofs, a terrific fire of musketry and cannon-shot\r\nlashed, as with a scourge of flame, the causeway on which the English\r\nguns were moving. Maude’s guns were halted, and opened fiercely in answer\r\nto this fire. The men fell fast. A musket-ball passed through Outram’s\r\narm, but, says Maude, “he only smiled, and asked one of us to tie his\r\nhandkerchief tightly above the wound.” The cluster of British guns, with\r\ntheir gallant gunners, stood in the very centre of a tempest of shot.\r\nHere is a picture, drawn by Maude, of the carnage in his battery:—\r\n\r\n    Almost at the same moment the finest soldier in our battery,\r\n    and the best artilleryman I have ever known, Sergeant-Major\r\n    Alexander Lamont, had the whole of his stomach carried away\r\n    by a round shot. He looked up to me for a moment with a\r\n    piteous expression, but had only strength to utter two words,\r\n    “Oh! God!” when he sank dead on the road. Just then another\r\n    round shot took off the leg, high up the thigh, of the next\r\n    senior sergeant, John Kiernan. He was afterwards carried back\r\n    to the Alumbagh, but soon died from the shock. Kiernan was\r\n    an excellent specimen of a Roman Catholic North of Ireland\r\n    soldier. He was as true as steel. Another tragic sight on\r\n    that road was the death of a fine young gunner, the only one,\r\n    I believe, who wore an artillery jacket that day. A round\r\n    shot took his head clean off, and for about a second the body\r\n    stood straight up, surmounted by the red collar, and then fell\r\n    flat on the road. But as fast as the men of the leading gun\r\n    detachments were swept away by the enemy’s fire I replaced\r\n    them by volunteers from other guns. Several times I turned to\r\n    the calm, cool, grim general standing near, and asked him to\r\n    allow us to advance, as we could not possibly do any good by\r\n    halting there. He agreed with me, but did not like to take the\r\n    responsibility of ordering us to go on.\r\n\r\nAt last the order to move on came, and Charbagh bridge was reached. It\r\nwas defended on the further side by a solid earthen rampart 7ft. high,\r\nbut with a narrow slit in the middle through which one man at a time\r\ncould pass. It was armed with six guns, two of them 24-pounders. Tall\r\nhouses, crowded with musketrymen, covered the bridge with their fire, and\r\nsolid battalions were drawn up in its rear. Maude was planted with two\r\nof his guns in the open, and within short range of the enemy’s battery,\r\nand commenced a valiant duel with it. Outram led the 5th Fusileers by\r\na detour for the purpose of smiting the battery at the bridge-head with\r\na flank-fire. Maude’s two guns were fighting six, at a distance of 150\r\nyards, and his gunners fell fast.\r\n\r\nAgain and again he had to call for volunteers to work his guns from the\r\nMadras Fusileers lying down under cover near him. The guns were of an\r\nancient pattern, and carried a large leathern pouch full of loose powder\r\nfor priming uses. “As the lane was very narrow,” says Maude, “the two\r\nguns were exceedingly close to one another, and when in their recoil they\r\npassed each other, amid a shower of sparks and smoke, they frequently\r\nset fire to the loose powder in the priming pouches, and blew the poor\r\ngunners up!” Yet Maude’s gallant lads worked their guns unflinchingly.\r\n\r\nNeill stood in a bay of a garden wall close by, with his “blue-caps”\r\nlying down under cover, waiting till Outram’s flanking movement should\r\ntell on the enemy’s battery; and Maude, with his artillerymen almost\r\nall shot down, said to young Havelock, “Do something, in the name of\r\nHeaven!” Havelock rode through the tempest of shot to Neill, and urged\r\nan immediate rush on the bridge; but Neill, with soldierly coolness,\r\ndeclared he would not move without orders. Then young Havelock played a\r\nboyish and gallant trick. He rode quietly off, turned round a bend in\r\nthe road, and a moment after came back at a gallop, gave a smart salute\r\nto Neill as he pulled up his horse on its haunches, and said, as though\r\nbringing an order from his father, “You are to carry the bridge at once,\r\nsir!”\r\n\r\nAt the word, Arnold, who commanded the “blue-caps,” leaped to his feet\r\nand raced on to the bridge, his men rising with a shout and following\r\nhim. Havelock and Tytler overtook him at a gallop, and the bridge in a\r\nmoment was covered with a mass of charging soldiers.\r\n\r\nBut a blast of shots from the guns at its head—the deep bellow of the\r\n24-pounders sounding high above the tumult—swept the bridge for a moment\r\nclear. Arnold had fallen with both legs smashed, Tytler’s horse had\r\ngone down with its brave rider; only young Havelock and a corporal of\r\nthe Fusileers, named Jakes, stood unhurt. Havelock rode coolly up to\r\nthe rampart of earth, and, waving his sword, called to the Fusileers to\r\n“come on”; and Corporal Jakes, as he busily plied his musket, shouted\r\nto Havelock, soothingly, “Never fear, sir! We’ll soon have the beggars\r\nout of that!” All this took but a few seconds of time; the Sepoys were\r\ntoiling with frantic energy to reload their guns. Then through the white\r\nsmoke came the rush of the Madras Fusileers—an officer leading. Over the\r\nbridge, up the seven-foot rampart, through the intervals betwixt the guns\r\nas with a single impulse, came the levelled bayonets and fierce faces of\r\nthe charging British, and the bridge was won!\r\n\r\nThe entire British force came swiftly over, the 78th was left to hold the\r\nbridge and form the rearguard, while the British column swung round to\r\nthe right and pushed on through the narrow lane that bordered the canal.\r\n\r\nThe 78th, while guarding the bridge, had a very trying experience. A\r\ngreat force of the enemy came down the Cawnpore road with banners flying\r\nand loud beating of drums, and flung itself with wild courage on the\r\nHighlanders. A little stone temple stood a hundred yards up the road,\r\ncommanding the bridge; the Sepoys took possession of this, and from it\r\ngalled the Highlanders cruelly with their fire. Hastings, of the 78th,\r\nstepped out to the front, and called for volunteers to storm the temple.\r\nThere was an angry rush of Highlanders up the road; the temple was\r\ncarried at the point of the bayonet, and then held as a sort of outwork\r\nto the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe Sepoys next brought up three brass guns, and lashed temple and road\r\nalike with their fire. Webster, an officer of the 78th, famous for his\r\nswordsmanship and strength, called out, “Who’s for these infernal guns?”\r\nand ran out, sword in hand. His Highlanders followed him, but could not\r\novertake Webster, who sprang upon the guns, and slew a gunner, just in\r\nthe act of putting his linstock to the touch-hole, with a stroke so\r\nmighty that it clove the Sepoy through skull and jaws almost to the\r\ncollar-bone! The guns were captured, dragged with a triumphant skirl\r\nof the pipes to the canal, and flung in, and the Highlanders set off to\r\nfollow the column.\r\n\r\nThey did not follow in its immediate track, but made a wide sweep to the\r\nright, and both sections of the column, with much stern fighting, reached\r\nwhat was called the Chutter Munzil Palace. “Here,” says Forbes, “were the\r\nchiefs of the little army. On his big ‘waler’ sat Outram, a splash of\r\nblood across his face, and one arm in a sling, the Malacca cane, which\r\nformed his sole weapon in battle, still grasped in the hand of the sound\r\nlimb. Havelock, on foot, was walking up and down on Outram’s near side,\r\nwith short steps. All around them, at a little distance, were officers,\r\nand outside of the circle so formed were soldiers, guns, wounded men,\r\nbullocks, camels”—all the tumult, in a word, of the battle.\r\n\r\nOutram and Havelock disagreed as to the next step to be taken. Outram—the\r\ncooler brain of the two—wished to halt for the night, and then to push\r\ntheir way in the morning through the successive courts of the palaces\r\nright up to the Residency. Havelock was eager to complete the day’s work,\r\nand reach the Residency with a final and desperate rush.\r\n\r\nA long, winding, and narrow street stretched before them up to the Bailey\r\nGuard Gate, the entrance to the Residency. It was true that every cross\r\nstreet that broke its length was swept by the fire of the enemy’s guns,\r\nthat the houses were loopholed and crowded with Sepoys, and from the\r\nflat roofs of the houses above a tempest of fire would be poured upon\r\nthe British. But Havelock was full of warlike impatience. “There is the\r\nstreet,” said he; “we see the worst. We shall be slated, but we can push\r\nthrough, and get it over.” Outram acknowledged afterwards that he ought\r\nto have said, “Havelock, we have virtually reached the Residency. I now\r\ntake the command;” but he added to the confession, “My temper got a\r\nlittle the better of me, and I said, ‘In God’s name, then, let us go on.’”\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders led, Havelock and Outram riding with their leading\r\nfiles. Brasyer’s Sikhs followed. It was, as Forbes says, “a true _via\r\ndolorosa_.” From house-roof, from door, from window, from every cross\r\nlane poured a tempest of shot, and through it the British could only push\r\nwith dogged, all-enduring courage, seldom halting to fire back. And this\r\nexperience stretched over more than three-quarters of a mile! Here is a\r\nlittle battle vignette taken from Forbes:—\r\n\r\n    In the foremost company of the Highland regiment were two\r\n    staunch comrades, named Glandell and M’Donough, Irishmen and\r\n    Catholics among the Scots and Presbyterians. In this street of\r\n    death M’Donough’s leg was shattered by a bullet. He fell, but\r\n    was not left to die. His stalwart chum raised the wounded man,\r\n    took him on his back, and trudged on with his heavy burden.\r\n    Nor did the hale man, thus encumbered, permit himself to be\r\n    a non-combatant. When a chance offered him to fire a shot,\r\n    Glandell propped his wounded comrade up against some wall,\r\n    and would betake himself to his rifle, while it could be of\r\n    service. Then he would pick M’Donough up again, and stagger\r\n    cheerily onward, till the well-deserved goal of safety was\r\n    reached.\r\n\r\nThe road at one point ran under an archway, and here Neill met with\r\nhis death-shot. He drew up his horse by the arch quite coolly, and was\r\nsteadying the soldiers as they swept through it. A Sepoy leaned forward\r\nfrom a window above the arch, with his musket almost touching Neill’s\r\nhead. Neill sat with his face turned to his shoulder, watching a gun\r\ngoing through the archway, when the Sepoy fired. His bullet struck the\r\nside of Neill’s head above the ear, and killed him instantly. Out of the\r\ntumult and passion of the fight thus dropped, in a moment, this most\r\ngallant of soldiers.\r\n\r\nStill the fierce fight raged. Still, beaten with a tempest of shot, the\r\ntormented column pushed on its dogged way. Suddenly from the head of\r\nthe column rose a mighty shout. It was not the cry of soldiers at the\r\ncharge, full of the wrath of battle. It was a great cry of exultation and\r\ntriumph. Through the grey twilight, dark with eddying smoke, the leading\r\nfiles of the British had seen the battered archway of the Bailey Guard.\r\nThe goal was reached.\r\n\r\nThe beleaguered garrison had listened, with what eagerness may be\r\nimagined, to the tumult of the fight as it crept nearer them. Its smoke\r\nwas blowing over their defences. Those who watched the advance from\r\nthe Residency could measure the approach of the relieving force by the\r\nattitudes and gestures of the Sepoys on the house-tops, as they fired\r\nfuriously down on the gallant column forcing its way along the streets\r\nbeneath them. The storm of sound grew louder, clearer, deeper. Suddenly,\r\nthrough the smoke and twilight, they caught a glimpse of figures on\r\nhorseback, the gleam of bayonets, the white faces and red uniforms of\r\nBritish soldiers. An earthwork blocked the Bailey Gate itself, but the\r\nhandful of men acting as the garrison of the gate, pulled hurriedly back\r\nfrom its ragged embrasure in the wall, to the left of the entrance, one\r\nof the guns, and through that embrasure—Outram, on his big Australian\r\nhorse, leading—came the Highlanders, with Havelock and his staff; then\r\nthe Sikhs; then the Fusileers. The Residency was reached!\r\n\r\nHow the shout of exultation ran round the seventeen shot-battered posts\r\nof the long-besieged entrenchments can be imagined. The women, the\r\nchildren, the very sick in the hospital, lent their voices to that shout.\r\nThe Highlanders, who came first, poured their Celtic exclamations and\r\nblessings on the men and women they had rescued. “We expected to have\r\nfound only your bones,” said one. That the children were still alive\r\nfilled the gallant but soft-hearted Highlanders with amazed joy. “The\r\nbig, rough-bearded soldiers,” wrote one of the rescued ladies, “were\r\nseizing the little children out of our arms, kissing them with tears\r\nrunning down their cheeks, and thanking God that they had come in time to\r\nsave them from the fate of those at Cawnpore.”\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered that for more than eighty days the garrison had\r\nlived under the shadow of death. No message, no whisper of news, from the\r\noutside world had reached them. Their rescuers were men of the same name\r\nand blood, who had fought their way as if through the flames of the Pit\r\nto reach and save them! And into what a mood of passionate joy amongst\r\nthe delivered, and of passionate exultation and triumph amongst the\r\ndeliverers, the crowd which thronged the Residency that night was lifted\r\nmay be more easily imagined than described. It was a night worth living\r\nfor; almost worth dying for.\r\n\r\nLady Inglis has told how she listened to the tremendous cheering that\r\nwelcomed the British across the Residency lines, and how her husband\r\nbrought up “a short, quiet-looking, grey-haired man,” who she guessed at\r\nonce was Havelock. It was a great triumph, but a great price was paid for\r\nit. The relieving column, out of its 3000 men, lost in killed or wounded\r\nmore than 700, nearly one in every four of its whole number!\r\n\r\nOne unfortunate incident marked the relief. As the Highlanders approached\r\nthe Bailey Guard Gate they took Aitken’s men of the 13th for the enemy,\r\nand leaped upon them with gleaming and angry bayonets, and slew some\r\nbefore their blunder was discovered. It was never imagined that the very\r\noutpost of the heroic garrison would be found to consist of Sepoys,\r\nfighting with such long-enduring loyalty against their own countrymen.\r\nIt was a very cruel fate for these faithful Sepoys to perish under the\r\nbayonets of the relieving force.\r\n\r\nStill another remarkable incident may be described. A cluster of doolies,\r\nwith wounded officers and men, lost its way in the tangled streets and\r\nwas cut off. Nine men of the escort, with five wounded, took refuge in\r\na small building which formed one side of the gateway where Neill had\r\nbeen shot; and for a whole day and night they defended themselves against\r\noverwhelming numbers. Dr. Home, of the 90th, was one of the party, and\r\nhas left a graphic account of what is perhaps the most brilliant little\r\nincident in the whole history of the siege.\r\n\r\nThe Sepoys kept up a bitter and tireless fire on the single doorway of\r\nthe room held by the nine. One of the British, a Fusileer named M’Manus,\r\nstood outside the doorway, sheltering himself behind a pillar, and\r\nshot down man after man of the enemy. So cool and quick and deadly was\r\nhis fire that the Sepoys feared to make a rush. At last their leader,\r\nto encourage them, shouted there were but three sahibs in the house,\r\nwhereupon the whole fourteen, wounded included, joined in a loud cheer to\r\nundeceive them. Captain Arnold, of the Fusileers, lay wounded in one of\r\nthe abandoned doolies visible through the doorway. Two gallant privates,\r\nRyan and M’Manus, charged out through the fire and carried their officer\r\ninto the house. They ran out a second time and brought in a wounded\r\nprivate; but in each case the comrade they carried was mortally wounded\r\nwhile in their arms.\r\n\r\nAgain and again some leader of the Sepoys ran out, heading a charge on\r\nthe doorway; but each time the leader was shot, and the Sepoys fell back.\r\nThe sorely beleaguered party was rescued the next morning. Just when hope\r\nseemed to have abandoned them, a new blast of musketry volleys was heard\r\nat a little distance, and one of the Fusileers recognised the regular\r\nsound. He jumped up, shouting, “Oh, boys, them’s our own chaps!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nLUCKNOW AND SIR COLIN CAMPBELL\r\n\r\n\r\nHavelock fought his way through blood and fire into the Residency, but he\r\nshrank from leading a great procession of women and children and wounded\r\nmen along that _via dolorosa_—that pathway of blood—by which, at so grim\r\na cost, he had himself reached the beleaguered garrison. The Residency,\r\nit was clear, must be held, since the great company of helpless women\r\nand children it sheltered could not be carried off. So what Havelock and\r\nOutram really accomplished was not so much a Relief as a Reinforcement.\r\n\r\nOutram assumed the command, and for six weeks the greatly-strengthened\r\ngarrison held its own with comparative ease against the revolted swarms,\r\nreckoned—uncertainly—at no less than 60,000 strong, who still maintained\r\na sullen blockade of the Residency.\r\n\r\nEarly in November reinforcements were pouring in from England, and a\r\nnew actor appeared on the scene. The crisis of the Mutiny called to\r\nthe post of commander-in-chief in India the best soldier Great Britain\r\npossessed. Colin Campbell was not, perhaps, a great general, in the\r\nsense in which Sir John Moore, or Wellington, or Sir Charles Napier were\r\ngenerals. But he was a tough, hard-fighting, much-experienced soldier,\r\nwith that combination of wariness and fire which marks the Scotch genius\r\nfor battle. What he did not know of the details of a soldier’s business\r\nmight almost be described as not worth knowing. He had served his\r\napprenticeship to war in the perils and hardships of Moore’s retreat to\r\nCorunna. A list of the battles and sieges in which he took part would\r\ncover almost the entire military history of Great Britain between Corunna\r\nand the Crimea. His cool skill and daring as a soldier are picturesquely\r\nillustrated by the famous “thin red line” incident at Balaclava; where,\r\ndisdaining to throw his troops into square, he received a charge of\r\nRussian cavalry on a thin extended front, and smote the assailing\r\nsquadron into fragments with a single blast of musketry.\r\n\r\nColin Campbell was sixty-five years of age, and regarded his military\r\ncareer as over; but on July 11, when the news of General Anson’s death\r\nreached England, Lord Panmure offered Campbell the chief command in\r\nIndia, and with characteristic promptitude the Scottish veteran offered\r\nto start for India the same afternoon! Campbell landed at Calcutta on\r\nAugust 13, spent some weeks there in “organising victory”—or, rather, in\r\nreorganising the whole shattered military system of the Presidency—and\r\non October 27 hurried to the seat of war. He reached Cawnpore on\r\nNovember 3, and on the 9th set out to relieve Lucknow. “Our friends in\r\nLucknow,” he wrote to his sister, “have food only for five or six days.”\r\nThis was a mistake that cost the lives of many brave men. Lawrence had\r\nprovisioned the Residency better than was imagined. But the delusion of\r\nimminent starvation, which made Havelock fight his way at such desperate\r\nspeed and cost into Lucknow, still prevailed, and governed British\r\nstrategy. Delhi had fallen by September 20—a story yet to be told—and\r\npart of its besieging force was thus available for a new march on Lucknow.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of November 11 Campbell reviewed the relieving force\r\nat Buntera. It was modest in numbers—counting only about 4700 men.\r\nBut war-hardened, and full of fiery yet disciplined daring, it was as\r\nefficient for all the purposes of battle as Napoleon’s Old Guard or\r\nWellington’s famous Light Division. The cavalry brigade included two\r\nsquadrons of the 9th Lancers, Hodson’s Horse, and three squadrons of\r\nnative cavalry. The Naval Brigade was under Peel, the third son of the\r\ngreat Prime Minister of England, one of the most daring yet gentle\r\nspirits that ever fought and died for England. Evelyn Wood, who served\r\nunder him as middy in the Crimea, describes him as “the bravest of the\r\nbrave,” and yet “an ideal English gentleman.” “His dark brown wavy hair\r\nwas carefully brushed back, disclosing a perfectly oval face, a high\r\nsquare forehead, and deep blue-grey eyes, which flashed when he was\r\ntalking eagerly, as he often did.” The Artillery Brigade consisted of\r\nfive batteries. The infantry was made up of detachments from the 4th, the\r\n5th, the 23rd Fusileers, a wing of the 53rd, part of the 82nd, and the\r\nfull strength of the 93rd Highlanders, with some Sikh regiments.\r\n\r\nThe 93rd was 1000 strong, and 700 men in the ranks carried the Crimean\r\nmedal on their breasts. It has been described as “the most Scotch of\r\nall the Highland regiments,” and a strong religious—as well as a rich\r\nCeltic—strain ran through its ranks. Forbes-Mitchell, indeed, who\r\nmarched in its ranks, says the regiment constituted a sort of military\r\nHighland parish, ministers and elders complete. The elders were selected\r\nfrom among the men of all ranks, two sergeants, two corporals, and two\r\nprivates. It had a regular service of communion plate, and the communion\r\nwas administered to the whole regiment by its chaplain twice a year.\r\n\r\nThe 93rd was drawn up in quarter-distance column on the extreme left of\r\nthe line as Colin Campbell rode down to review his forces that November\r\nafternoon. It was in full Highland costume, with kilts and bonnets and\r\nwind-blown plumes. Campbell’s Celtic blood kindled when he reached the\r\nHighlanders. “Ninety-third!” he said, “you are my own lads; I rely on you\r\nto do the work.” And a voice from the ranks in broadest Doric answered,\r\n“Ay, ay, Sir Colin, ye ken us and we ken you; we’ll bring the women and\r\nchildren out of Lucknow or die wi’ you in the attempt.” And then from\r\nthe steady ranks of the Highlanders there broke a shout, sudden and deep\r\nand stern, the shout of valiant men—the men of the hardy North—pledging\r\nthemselves to valiant deeds.\r\n\r\nHere is the description given by an eye-witness of the little army, less\r\nthan 5000 strong, but of such magnificent fighting quality, down whose\r\nranks Colin Campbell rode as the November sun was going down:—\r\n\r\n    The field-guns from Delhi looked blackened and service-worn;\r\n    but the horses were in good condition, and the harness in\r\n    perfect repair; the gunners bronzed, stalwart, and in perfect\r\n    fighting case. The 9th Lancers, with their gallant bearing,\r\n    their flagless lances, and their lean but hardy horses, looked\r\n    the perfection of regular cavalry on active service. Wild\r\n    and bold was the bearing of the Sikh horsemen, clad in loose\r\n    fawn-coloured dress, with long boots, blue or red turbans and\r\n    sashes; and armed with carbine and tulwar. Next to them were\r\n    the worn and wasted remains of the 8th and 75th Queen’s, who,\r\n    with wearied air, stood grouped under their colours. Then came\r\n    the two regiments of Punjab infantry, tall of stature, with\r\n    fierce eager eyes under their huge turbans—men swift in the\r\n    march, forward in the fight, and eager for the pillage. On the\r\n    left of the line, in massive serried ranks, a waving sea of\r\n    plumes and tartan, stood the 93rd Highlanders, who with loud\r\n    and rapturous cheers welcomed the veteran commander whom they\r\n    knew so well and loved so warmly.\r\n\r\nOn November 12 Campbell had reached the Alumbagh, and, halting there,\r\ndecided on the line of his advance to the Residency. Instead of advancing\r\ndirect on the city, and fighting his way through loopholed and narrow\r\nlanes, each one a mere valley of death, he proposed to swing round to the\r\nright, march in a wide curve through the open ground, and seize what was\r\nknown as the Dilkusha Park, a great enclosed garden, surrounded by a wall\r\n20 feet high, a little over two miles to the east of the Residency. Using\r\nthis as his base, he would next move round to the north of the city,\r\nforcing his way through a series of strong posts, the most formidable\r\nof which were the Secundrabagh and the Shah Nujeef, and so reach the\r\nResidency. And the story of the fighting at those two points makes up the\r\ntragedy and glory of the Relief of Lucknow.\r\n\r\nOutram, of course, was not the man to lie inertly within his defences\r\nwhile Campbell was moving to his relief. He had already sent plans of\r\nthe city and its approaches, with suggestions as to the best route, to\r\nCampbell by means of a spy, and he was prepared to break out on the\r\nline by which the relieving force was to advance. But if Campbell could\r\nbe supplied with a guide, who knew the city as he knew the palm of his\r\nown hand, this would be an enormous advantage; and exactly such a guide\r\nat this moment presented himself. A civilian named Kavanagh offered to\r\nundertake this desperate mission.\r\n\r\nKavanagh was an Irishman, a clerk in one of the civil offices, and\r\napparently possessed a hundred disqualifications for the business of\r\nmaking his way, disguised as a native, through the dark-faced hordes that\r\nkept sleepless watch round the Residency, and through the busy streets\r\nof Lucknow beyond. He was a big-limbed, fair man, with aggressively\r\nred hair, and uncompromisingly blue eyes! By what histrionic art could\r\nhe be “translated,” in Shakespeare’s sense, into a spindle-shanked,\r\nnarrow-shouldered, dusky-skinned Oude peasant? But Kavanagh was a man of\r\nquenchless courage, with a more than Irish delight in deeds of daring,\r\nand he had a perfect knowledge of native dialect and character. He has\r\nleft a narrative of his adventure.\r\n\r\nA spy had come in from Campbell, and was to return that night, and\r\nKavanagh conceived the idea of going out with him, and acting as guide\r\nto the relieving force. Outram hesitated to permit the attempt to be\r\nmade, declaring it to be too dangerous; but Kavanagh’s eagerness for\r\nthe adventure prevailed. He hid the whole scheme from his wife, and,\r\nat half-past seven o’clock that evening, when he entered Outram’s\r\nheadquarters, he was so perfectly disguised that nobody recognised him.\r\nHe had blackened his face, neck, and arms with lamp-black, mixed with\r\na little oil. His red hair, which even lamp-black and oil could hardly\r\nsubdue to a colder tint, was concealed beneath a huge turban. His dress\r\nwas that of a budmash, or irregular native soldier, with sword and\r\nshield, tight trousers, a yellow-coloured chintz sheet thrown over the\r\nshoulders, and a white cummerbund.\r\n\r\nA little after eight o’clock Kavanagh, with his native guide, crept\r\nto the bank of the Goomtee, which ran to the north of the Residency\r\nentrenchment. The river was a hundred yards wide, and between four feet\r\nand five feet deep. Both men stripped, crept down the bank, and slipped,\r\nas silently as otters, into the stream. Here for a moment, as Kavanagh in\r\nhis narrative confesses, his courage failed him. The shadowy bank beyond\r\nthe black river was held by some 60,000 merciless enemies. He had to pass\r\nthrough their camps and guards, and through miles of city streets beyond.\r\nIf detected, he would certainly perish by torture. “If my guide had been\r\nwithin my reach,” he says, “I should perhaps have pulled him back and\r\nabandoned the enterprise.” But the guide was already vanishing, a sort of\r\ncrouching shadow, into the blackness of the further bank; and, hardening\r\nhis heart, Kavanagh stole on through the sliding gloom of the river.\r\n\r\nBoth men crept up a ditch that pierced the river-bank to a cluster of\r\ntrees, and there dressed; and then, with his tulwar on his shoulder and\r\nthe swagger of a budmash, Kavanagh went boldly forward with his guide.\r\nA matchlock man first met the adventurous pair and peered suspiciously\r\nat them from under his turban. Kavanagh in a loud voice volunteered\r\nthe remark that “the night was cold,” and passed on. They had to cross\r\nthe iron bridge which spanned the Goomtee, and the officer on guard\r\nchallenged them lazily from the balcony of a two-storeyed house. Kavanagh\r\nhimself hung back in the shade, while his guide went forward and told\r\nthe story of how they belonged to a village some miles distant, and were\r\ngoing to the city from their homes.\r\n\r\nThey were allowed to pass, ran the gauntlet of many troops of Sepoys,\r\nre-crossed the Goomtee by what was called the stone bridge, and passed\r\nunsuspected along the principal street of Lucknow, jostling their way\r\nthrough the crowds, and so reached the open fields beyond the city.\r\n“I had not been in green fields,” writes Kavanagh, “for five months.\r\nEverything around us smelt sweet, and a carrot I took from the roadside\r\nwas the most delicious thing I had ever tasted!” But it was difficult to\r\nfind their way in the night. They wandered into the Dilkusha Park, and\r\nstumbled upon a battery of guns, which Kavanagh, to the terror of his\r\nguide, insisted upon inspecting.\r\n\r\nThey next blundered into the canal, but still wandered on, till they\r\nfell into the hands of a guard of twenty-five Sepoys, and Kavanagh’s\r\nguide, in his terror, dropped in the dust of the road the letter he was\r\ncarrying from Outram to Campbell. Kavanagh, however, kept his coolness,\r\nand after some parleying he and his guide were allowed to pass on. The\r\nmuch-enduring pair next found themselves entangled in a swamp, and,\r\nwaist-deep in its slime and weeds, they struggled on for two hours, when\r\nthey reached solid ground again. Kavanagh insisted on lying down to rest\r\nfor a time. Next they crept between some Sepoy pickets which, with true\r\nnative carelessness, had thrown out no sentries, and finally, just as the\r\neastern sky was growing white with the coming day, the two adventurers\r\nheard the challenge, “Who comes there?” from under the shadow of a great\r\ntree!\r\n\r\nIt was a British cavalry picket, and Kavanagh had soon the happiness\r\nof pouring into Sir Colin Campbell’s ears the messages and information\r\nhe brought, while a flag, hoisted at twelve o’clock on the summit of\r\nthe Alumbagh, told Outram that his messenger had succeeded, and that\r\nboth the garrison and the relieving force had now a common plan. It is\r\ndifficult to imagine a higher example of human courage than that supplied\r\nby “Lucknow” Kavanagh, as he was afterwards called, and never was the\r\nVictoria Cross better won.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 15th Campbell made an elaborate reconnaissance\r\non his extreme left, and all night he thundered in that direction\r\nwith his guns, and the enemy gathered in full strength on that line,\r\npersuaded that the British would advance on it. But by daybreak on the\r\n16th Campbell was moving off, light-footed and swift, by his right,\r\nexactly where the enemy did not expect him! He had little over 3000\r\nbayonets in his force, but he was strong in artillery, counting in all\r\nthirty-nine guns, six mortars, and two rocket-tubes, and he hoped to\r\nsmash by the weight of his fire every obstacle that stood in his path to\r\nthe Residency. Yet, be it remembered, he was moving on the arc of a great\r\nfortified central position, held by a hostile force not less than 60,000\r\nstrong, or more than fifteen times more numerous than his own.\r\n\r\nBlunt’s guns and a company of the 53rd formed Campbell’s advance-guard.\r\nThey crossed the canal, followed for a mile the river-bank, and then\r\nswung sharply to the left by a road which ran parallel to the rear of\r\nthe Secundrabagh. This was a great garden, 150 yards on each face, with\r\nwalls twenty feet high, and a circular bastion at each angle, and from\r\nits rear face, as the head of the British column came in sight, broke\r\nan angry tempest of musket-shot, a fire which, it must be remembered,\r\nsmote the advancing British column on the flank. Cavalry and infantry\r\nwere helpless in the narrow lane, and something like a “jam” took place.\r\nBlunt, however, an officer of great daring, with an enthusiastic belief\r\nthat British guns could go anywhere and do anything, cut the knot of the\r\ndifficulty. The bank of the lane was so steep that it seemed impossible\r\nthat horses and guns could climb it, but Blunt, with cool decision, put\r\nthe guns in motion, swung the horses’ heads sharply round, and, with\r\nwhip and spur and shout, his gunners drove the snorting, panting horses\r\nup the bank into the open space under the fire of the Secundrabagh.\r\n\r\nTravers, with two of his 18-pounders, came stumbling and struggling\r\nup the steep bank after Blunt. The guns were swung round, and, within\r\nmusket-shot distance of the crowded walls and under a tempest of\r\nbullets, they opened a breaching fire on the face of the Secundrabagh.\r\nThe British infantry meanwhile, lying down under the bank of the lane,\r\nwaited for the moment of assault. Forbes-Mitchell gives a very realistic\r\npicture of the march up the lane, and the waiting under the shelter of\r\na low mud-wall while the breach was being made, through which they must\r\ncharge. Campbell himself, before the men moved up, had given amusingly\r\nprosaic instructions as to how they were to fight. When they swept into\r\nthe Secundrabagh they were to “keep together in clusters of threes, and\r\nrely on nothing but the bayonet.” The central man of each group of three\r\nwas to attack, and his comrades, right and left, guard him with their\r\nbayonets, &c.\r\n\r\nAs the 93rd moved up the lane, Forbes-Mitchell relates how they saw\r\nsitting on the roadside a naked Hindu, with shaven head and face streaked\r\nwith white and red paint, busy counting his rosary, and unmoved by the\r\ntumult of battle. A Highlander said to a young staff-officer who was just\r\npassing, “I would like to try my bayonet on the hide of that painted\r\nscoundrel, sir; he looks a murderer.” “Don’t touch him,” answered the\r\nstaff-officer, “he is a harmless Hindu mendicant; it is the Mohammedans\r\nwho are to blame for the horrors of the Mutiny.” Scarcely had he spoken\r\nthe words when the Hindu stopped counting his beads, slipped his hands\r\nunder the mat on which he sat, and, with a single movement, drew\r\nout a short bell-mouthed blunderbuss and fired into the unfortunate\r\nstaff-officer’s breast, killing him instantly, and himself dying a\r\nmoment afterwards, under the reddened bayonets of half-a-dozen furious\r\nHighlanders.\r\n\r\nSir Colin Campbell himself stood by the guns, watching the balls tearing\r\naway flakes from the stubborn bricks which formed the immense thickness\r\nof the wall. Every now and then he repressed the eagerness of the\r\nHighlanders or Sikhs, waiting to make their rush. “Lie down, 93rd!” he\r\nsaid. “Lie down! Every man of you is worth his weight in gold to England\r\nto-day.” For nearly three-quarters of an hour that strange scene lasted,\r\nthe British guns battering the tough brick wall, while from hundreds of\r\nloopholes a tempest of bullets scourged the toiling gunners. Twice over\r\nthe detachments at the guns had to be renewed before the breach could be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe crouching infantry meanwhile could hardly be restrained. A sergeant\r\nof the 53rd, a Welshman named Dobbin, called out, “Let the infantry\r\nstorm, Sir Colin! Let the two Thirds at them”—meaning the 53rd and\r\n93rd—“and we’ll soon make short work of the murdering villains.”\r\nCampbell, always good-tempered when the bullets were flying, recognised\r\nthe man, and asked, “Do you think the breach is wide enough, Dobbin?”\r\n\r\nThe three regiments waiting for the rush were the 53rd, the 93rd, and\r\na Sikh regiment—the 4th Rifles; and suddenly they leaped up and joined\r\nin one eager dash at the slowly widening breach. Whether the signal to\r\nadvance was given at all is doubtful, and which regiment led, and which\r\nbrave soldier was first through the breach, are all equally doubtful\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nMalleson says the rush on the Secundrabagh was “the most wonderful scene\r\nwitnessed in the war.” No order was given; but suddenly the Sikhs and\r\nthe Highlanders were seen racing for the breach at full speed, bonneted\r\nHighlander and brown-faced Sikh straining every nerve to reach it first.\r\nA Sikh of the 4th Rifles, he adds, outran the leading Highlander, leaped\r\nthrough the breach, and was shot dead as he sprang. An ensign of the\r\n93rd, named Cooper, was a good second, and, leaping feet first through\r\nthe hole like a gymnast, got safely through.\r\n\r\nHope Grant says that “before the order was given a native Sikh officer\r\nstarted forward, sword in hand, followed by his men.” The 93rd determined\r\nnot to let the Sikhs outcharge them, and instantly ran forward. The\r\nSikhs had a few yards’ start, but “a sergeant of the 93rd, Sergeant-Major\r\nMurray, a fine active fellow, outstripped them, jumped through the\r\nopening like a harlequin, and, as he landed on the other side, was shot\r\nthrough the breast and fell dead.” Archibald Forbes says the first man\r\nthrough the breach was an Irishman, Lance-Corporal Donnelly, of the 93rd,\r\nkilled as he jumped through the breach; the second was a Sikh, the third\r\na Scotchman, Sergeant-Major Murray, also killed. Who shall decide when\r\nthere is such a conflict of testimony betwixt the very actors in the\r\ngreat scene!\r\n\r\nRoberts confirms Hope Grant in the statement that a Highlander was the\r\nfirst to reach the goal, and was shot dead as he reached the enclosure;\r\nand he adds one curiously pathetic detail. A drummer-boy of the 93rd, he\r\nsays, “must have been one of the first to pass that grim boundary between\r\nlife and death; for when I got in I found him just inside the breach,\r\nlying on his back, quite dead, a pretty, innocent-looking, fair-haired\r\nlad, not more than fourteen years old.” What daring must have burned in\r\nthat lad’s Scottish blood when he thus took his place in the very van of\r\nthe wild rush of veterans into the Secundrabagh!\r\n\r\nForbes-Mitchell, who actually took part in the charge, gives yet another\r\naccount. The order to charge, he says, was given, and the Sikhs, who\r\ncaught it first, leaped over the mud-wall, behind which they were lying,\r\nshouting their war-cry, and, led by their two British officers, ran\r\neagerly towards the breach. Both their officers were shot before they had\r\nrun many yards, and at that the Sikhs halted. “As soon as Sir Colin saw\r\nthem waver, he turned to the 93rd, and said, ‘Colonel Ewart, bring on the\r\ntartan! Let my own lads at them.’” Before the command could be repeated,\r\nor the buglers had time to sound the advance, “the whole seven companies\r\nlike one man leaped over the wall with such a yell of pent-up rage as I\r\nnever heard before nor since. It was not a cheer, but a concentrated yell\r\nof rage and ferocity, that made the echoes ring again; and it must have\r\nstruck terror into the defenders, for they actually ceased firing, and we\r\ncould see them through the breach rushing from the outside wall to take\r\nshelter in the two-storeyed building in the centre of the garden, the\r\ngate and doors of which they firmly barred.”\r\n\r\nThe Secundrabagh, it must be remembered, was held by four strong Sepoy\r\nregiments, numbering in all from 2000 to 3000 men, many of them veteran\r\nsoldiers, wearing the medals they had won in British service, and they\r\nfought with desperate courage. The human jet of stormers through the gap\r\nin the wall was a mere tiny squirt, but the main body of the 93rd blew in\r\nthe lock of the great gate with their bullets, and came sweeping in.\r\n\r\nLord Roberts gives another version of this incident. The Sepoys, he\r\nsays, were driven out of the earthwork which covered the gateway, and\r\nwere swept back into the Secundrabagh, and the heavy doors of the great\r\ngateway were being hurriedly shut in the face of the stormers. A subahdar\r\nof the 4th Punjab Infantry reached the gate in time enough to thrust his\r\nleft arm, on which was carried a shield, between the closing doors. His\r\nhand was slashed across by a tulwar from within, whereupon he drew it\r\nout, instantly thrusting in the other arm, when his right hand, in turn,\r\nwas all but severed from the wrist! But he kept the gates from being\r\nshut, and in another minute the men of the 93rd, of the 53rd, and of the\r\ngallant Punjabee’s own regiment went storming in.\r\n\r\nThe men of the 53rd again tried, with success, another device. They\r\nlifted their caps on the tips of their bayonets to a line of iron-barred\r\nwindows above their heads, and thus drew the fire of their defenders.\r\nThen they leaped up, tore away the bars, and, clambering on each other’s\r\nshoulders, broke through. Forbes-Mitchell was the fifth or sixth man\r\nthrough the breach, and was immediately fired upon point-blank by a\r\nSepoy lying in the grass half-a-dozen yards distant. The bullet struck\r\nthe thick brass buckle on his belt, and such was the force of the\r\nblow that it tumbled him head over heels. Colonel Ewart came next to\r\nForbes-Mitchell, who heard his colonel say, as he rushed past him, “Poor\r\nfellow! he is done for.” Ewart, a gallant Highlander, of commanding\r\nstature, played a great part in the struggle within the Secundrabagh. His\r\nbonnet was shot or struck off his head, and, bareheaded, amidst the push\r\nand sway and madness of the fight, he bore himself like a knight of old.\r\n\r\nThe fight within the walls of the Secundrabagh raged for nearly two\r\nhours, and the sounds that floated up from it as the Sepoys, “fighting\r\nlike devils”—to quote an actor in the scene,—were driven from floor to\r\nfloor of the building, or across the green turf of the garden, were\r\nappalling. The fighting passion amongst the combatants often took queer\r\nshapes. Thus one man, known amongst the 93rd as “the Quaker,” from his\r\ngreat quietness, charged into the Secundrabagh like a kilted and male\r\nFury, and, according to Forbes-Mitchell, quoting a verse of the Scottish\r\npsalm with every thrust of his bayonet or shot from his rifle:—\r\n\r\n    “I’ll of salvation take the cup,\r\n      On God’s name will I call;\r\n    I’ll pay my vows now to the Lord\r\n      Before His people all.”\r\n\r\nScottish psalm, punctuated with bayonet thrusts: this surely is the\r\nstrangest battle-hymn ever heard!\r\n\r\nEwart found that two native officers had carried the regimental flag into\r\na narrow and dark room, and were defending themselves like wild cats.\r\nEwart leaped single-handed into the room, and captured the colours,\r\nslaying both officers. The fight within the Secundrabagh was by this\r\ntime practically over, and Ewart ran outside, and bareheaded, with\r\nblood-stained uniform and smoke-blackened face, ran up to Sir Colin as\r\nhe sat on his grey horse, and cried, “We are in possession, sir! I have\r\nkilled the last two of the enemy with my own hand, and here is one of\r\ntheir colours.” “D⸺ your colours, sir!” was the wrathful response of\r\nSir Colin. “It’s not your place to be taking colours. Go back to your\r\nregiment this instant, sir.” Sir Colin had a Celtic shortness of temper;\r\nthe strain of waiting while the madness of the fight raged within the\r\ngreat walls had told on his nerves. He was eager to get his 93rd into\r\nregimental shape again; and, as Forbes-Mitchell argues, believed, from\r\nhis appearance and bearing, that Ewart was drunk! So he was: but it was\r\nwith the passion of battle!\r\n\r\nThe officers of Sir Colin’s staff read Ewart’s condition more truly,\r\nand as this ragged, blood-stained figure, carrying the captured flag,\r\ncame running out from the furnace of the great fight, they cheered\r\nvehemently. Later in the day Sir Colin himself apologised to Ewart for\r\nhis brusqueness.\r\n\r\nIn the whole record of war there are not many scenes of slaughter to be\r\ncompared with that which took place within the walls of the Secundrabagh.\r\nThe 53rd held the north side of the great quadrangle, the Sikhs and the\r\n93rd the east side, and a mixed force, composed of several regiments,\r\nheld the south; on the west there was no escape. The great mass of\r\nSepoys in the centre of the quadrangle was thus pelted with lead and\r\nfire from the three fronts. “We fired volley after volley into the dense\r\nmultitude,” says Jones-Parry, “until nothing was left but a moving mass,\r\nlike mites in a cheese!”\r\n\r\nOf the 2000 or 2500 Sepoys who formed the garrison of the Secundrabagh\r\nnot one man escaped. Its whole area, when the fight was over, was red\r\nwith blood and strewn with the bodies of slain men. Four whole regiments\r\nof mutineers were simply blotted out. Many of the slain Sepoys wore\r\nPunjab medals on their breasts; many, too, were found to have leave\r\ncertificates, signed by former commanding officers, in their pockets,\r\nshowing they had been on leave when the regiment mutinied, and had\r\nrejoined their regiment to fight against the British. The walls of the\r\nSecundrabagh still stand, a long, low mound along one side showing where\r\nthe great company of slain Sepoys were buried. What other patch of the\r\nearth’s surface, of equal size, has ever witnessed more of human valour\r\nand of human despair than those few square yards of turf that lie within\r\nthe shot-battered walls of this ancient Indian pleasure-garden!\r\n\r\nThe British losses, curiously enough, were comparatively light, except\r\namongst the officers. The 93rd had nine officers killed and wounded. The\r\n4th Punjab infantry went into the fight with four British officers; two\r\nwere killed, one was desperately wounded, and the regiment was brought\r\nout of the fight by the sole surviving officer, Lieut. Willoughby,\r\nhimself only a lad. He was recommended for the V.C., but did not live\r\nto wear that much-coveted decoration, as he was slain in fight shortly\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nBut the strongest post held by the rebels, in the track along which the\r\nBritish were moving towards the Residency, was the Shah Nujeef, a great\r\nand massively-built mosque, girdled with a high loopholed wall, and\r\nscreened by trees and enclosures of various kinds. Campbell brought up\r\nPeel, with his Naval Brigade, to make a breach in the massive walls of\r\nthe Shah Nujeef, and that gallant sailor ran his guns up within twenty\r\nyards of the loopholed walls of the great mosque, and, swinging them\r\nround, opened fire, while the gunners were shot down in quick succession\r\nas they toiled to load and discharge their pieces. “It was an action,”\r\nsaid Sir Colin in his despatch afterwards, “almost unexampled in war.”\r\nPeel, in a word, behaved very much as if he were laying the _Shannon_\r\nalongside an enemy’s frigate!\r\n\r\nAs the men ran up their guns to the walls of the Shah Nujeef,\r\nForbes-Mitchell says he saw a sailor lad, just in front of him, who had\r\nhis leg carried clean off by a round shot, which struck him above the\r\nknee. “He sat bolt upright on the grass, with the blood spouting from the\r\nstump of his leg like water from the hose of a fire-engine, and shouted,\r\n‘Here goes a shilling a day, a shilling a day! Remember Cawnpore, 93rd;\r\nremember Cawnpore! Go at them, my hearties;’ and then sank down and died.”\r\n\r\nBut the defence of the Shah Nujeef was stubborn, and for three hours Peel\r\nworked his guns under a double cross-fire, and still his 18-pounders\r\nfailed to pierce the solid walls of the great mosque. The 93rd were\r\nbrought up, and, lying down under what shelter they could secure,\r\ntried to keep down the musketry fire from the walls, and many of them\r\nwere shot down by bullets or arrows from the summit of the mosque.\r\nThe external masonry had flaked off, leaving a rough, irregular face,\r\nup which an active cat might possibly have scrambled; and at this a\r\nbattalion of detachments—in which clusters from a dozen regiments were\r\ncombined—under the command of Major Branston, was launched. The men ran\r\nforward with utmost daring, but the wall was twenty feet high; there were\r\nno scaling-ladders. It was impossible to climb the broken face of the\r\nmasonry. Branston fell, shot, and his second in command, the present Lord\r\nWolseley, kept up the attack, making desperate attempts to escalade.\r\n\r\nA tree stood at an angle of the Shah Nujeef, close to the wall, and\r\ngiving the chance of firing over it. Peel offered the Victoria Cross to\r\nany of his men who would climb it. Two lieutenants and a leading seaman\r\nnamed Harrison in a moment, with seamanlike activity, clambered up\r\nthe tree, and opened a deadly fire on the enemy. Each man of the three\r\nwas in turn shot, but not till they had accomplished the task they had\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nNightfall was coming on. It was impossible to turn back; it seemed\r\nequally impossible to carry the Shah Nujeef. Peel’s guns, firing for\r\nnearly three hours at point-blank range, had failed to tear the stubborn\r\nmasonry to pieces. The answering fire, both of cannon and musketry, from\r\neither flank, which covered the face of the great mosque being assailed,\r\ngrew heavier every moment. Campbell then called upon the 93rd, and told\r\nthem he would lead them himself, as the place must be carried. The\r\nlives of the women and children inside the Residency were at stake. A\r\ndozen voices from the ranks called out that they would carry the place,\r\nright enough, but Sir Colin must not expose his own life. “We can lead\r\nourselves,” cried one after another. Whether even the 93rd could have\r\nclambered over the lofty and unbroken walls of the Shah Nujeef may be\r\ndoubted, but at this moment the wit and daring of a Scotch soldier saved\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nThere are conflicting versions of the incident, but Forbes-Mitchell shall\r\ntell the story:—\r\n\r\n    Just at that moment Sergeant John Paton, of my company,\r\n    came running down the ravine at the moment the battalion of\r\n    detachments had been ordered to storm. He had discovered a\r\n    breach in the north-east corner of the rampart, next to the\r\n    river Goomtee. It appears that our shot and shell had gone\r\n    over the first breach, and had blown out the wall on the other\r\n    side in this particular spot. Paton told how he had climbed up\r\n    to the top of the ramparts without difficulty, and seen right\r\n    inside the place, as the whole defending force had been called\r\n    forward to repulse the assault in front. Captain Dawson and his\r\n    company were at once called out, and while the others opened\r\n    fire on the breach in front of them, we dashed down the ravine,\r\n    Sergeant Paton showing the way. As soon as the enemy saw that\r\n    the breach behind had been discovered, and their well-defended\r\n    position was no longer tenable, they fled like sheep through\r\n    the back gate next to the Goomtee, and another in the direction\r\n    of the Mootee Munzil. If No. 7 company had got in behind them\r\n    and cut off their retreat by the back gate, it would have been\r\n    Secundrabagh over again.\r\n\r\nPaton received the Victoria Cross for that signal service. He was a\r\nsoldier of the finest type, took part in more than thirty engagements,\r\nand passed through them all without so much as a scratch. Paton emigrated\r\nin 1861 to Melbourne; a little later he entered the service of the New\r\nSouth Wales Government, and became Governor of Goulburn Gaol, retiring on\r\na pension in February 1896.\r\n\r\nA quiet night followed a day so fierce. The troops were exhausted.\r\nTheir rifles, in addition, had become so foul with four days’ heavy\r\nwork that it was almost impossible to load them. The next day, however,\r\nthe advance was continued, and position after position was carried, the\r\nlast being what was known as the Mess-house. This was carried by a wing\r\nof the 53rd, led by Captain Hopkins—“one of the bravest men that ever\r\nlived,” says Malleson; “a man who literally revelled in danger.” From\r\nthe summit of the Mess-house the Union Jack was hoisted as a signal to\r\nthe Residency, but on the flag the exasperated Sepoys concentrated their\r\nfire, and twice in succession it was shot down. Forbes-Mitchell says that\r\na previous and successful attempt to signal to the Residency had been\r\nmade from the Shah Nujeef. The adjutant of the 93rd, Lieutenant M’Bean,\r\na sergeant, and a little drummer-boy, twelve years old, named Ross, and\r\ntiny for his age, climbed to the summit of the dome of the Shah Nujeef,\r\nput a Highland bonnet on the tip of the staff, waved the regimental\r\ncolour of the 93rd, while the boy sounded the regimental call shrilly on\r\nhis bugle.\r\n\r\nThe signal was seen and answered from the Residency, its flag being\r\nraised and lowered three times; but every Sepoy battery within range\r\ninstantly opened on the three figures on the summit of the dome. They\r\nquickly descended, but little Ross turned, ran up the ladder again like a\r\nmonkey, and, holding on to the spire of the dome with his left hand, blew\r\nthe call known as “The Cock of the North” as a blast of defiance to the\r\nenemy!\r\n\r\nOutram meanwhile was pushing cautiously on in the direction of Campbell’s\r\nattack, occupying building after building; and late in the afternoon\r\nOutram and Havelock and Campbell had clasped hands on the sloping ground\r\nin front of the Mess-house. A hole had to be broken through the western\r\nwall of the Pearl Palace enclosure to let the chiefs of the beleaguered\r\ngarrison through, and a slab in the wall still marks the spot. Campbell,\r\nHavelock, and Outram met on the slope outside the Mess-house, and the\r\nmeeting of three such soldiers under such conditions was a memorable\r\nevent. No red-coated Boswell, unhappily, has told us how the veterans\r\ngreeted each other. The Kaisarbagh, strongly held by the mutineers,\r\noverlooked the little patch of rough soil on which the three famous\r\nsoldiers stood, and every gun that could be trained upon the group broke\r\ninto fire. It was to an accompaniment of bellowing cannon, of bursting\r\nshells, and of whistling bullets that Campbell, Havelock, and Outram\r\nexchanged their first greeting.\r\n\r\nYoung Roberts, with Captain Norman, accompanied Outram and Havelock\r\nback to the Residency, and he has described how he passed from post to\r\npost, held with such long-enduring and stubborn courage by the relieved\r\ngarrison. “When we came,” he says, “to the Bailey Guard, and looked at\r\nthe battered walls and gateway, not an inch without a mark of a round\r\nshot or bullet, we marvelled that Aitken and Loughnan could have managed\r\nto defend it for nearly five months.” It was found difficult to get the\r\nrelieved garrison to talk of their own experiences; they were too hungry\r\nfor news from the outside world! Jones-Parry says, “The first man of\r\nthe garrison I met was my old schoolfellow and chum, Meecham. He was an\r\nexcellent specimen of the condition of the defenders, for he looked more\r\nlike a greyhound than a man. He was thin as a lath, and his eyes looked\r\nsunken into his head.”\r\n\r\nLucknow was relieved; but to reach the Residency had cost Sir Colin\r\nCampbell a loss of 45 officers and 496 men. Campbell found his position\r\ndifficult. He had broken through the besieging force; he had not ended\r\nthe siege. To hold the Residency meant to be besieged himself. He decided\r\nto bring off the Residency garrison, with the women and children,\r\nabandoning the shot-wrecked walls and foul trenches to the enemy. To\r\nevacuate the Residency, carrying off in safety, through the lines of a\r\nhostile force five times as numerous as his own, 600 women and children,\r\nand more than 1000 sick or wounded men, was a great feat, but Sir Colin\r\nCampbell accomplished it, and did it so adroitly that not a casualty was\r\nincurred, and not a serviceable gun abandoned. So completely, in fact,\r\ndid Sir Colin Campbell deceive the enemy that their guns were pouring\r\ntheir fire angrily on the Residency for at least four hours after the\r\nlast British soldier had left it!\r\n\r\nHavelock died just as he was being carried out of the slender and\r\nbattered defences he had reached and held so gallantly. He died of an\r\nattack of dysentery, brought on, says Major Anson, “by running nearly\r\nthree-quarters of a mile under fire from the Residency to meet the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and greet him as his deliverer.”\r\n\r\nHe lies buried in the Alumbagh, the place Havelock himself won by an\r\nassault so daring when advancing to relieve Lucknow. He was buried on\r\nthe morning of November 25, and round his rude coffin, on which the\r\nbattle-flag lay, stood his sorrowing comrades, a group of the most\r\ngallant soldiers that earthly battlefields have ever known—Campbell, and\r\nOutram, and Peel, and Adrian Hope, and Fraser Tytler, and the younger\r\nHavelock, with men of the Ross-shire Buffs and of the Madras Fusileers,\r\nwhom Havelock had so often led to victory. On a tree that grew beside the\r\ngrave the letter H was roughly carved, to mark where Havelock’s body lay.\r\nTo-day the interior of the Alumbagh is a garden, and a shapely obelisk\r\nmarks the spot where sleeps the dust of one of the bravest soldiers that\r\never fought for the honour and flag of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SEPOY IN THE OPEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe losses of the beleaguered English during the siege of the Residency\r\nwere, of course, great. When the siege began the garrison consisted of\r\n927 Europeans—not three out of four being soldiers—and 765 natives. Up to\r\nthe date of the relief by Havelock—87 days—350 Europeans, more than one\r\nout of every three of the whole European force, were killed or died of\r\ndisease!\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note how all the swiftly-changing events and passions\r\nof the Mutiny are reflected in such of the diaries and journals of the\r\nperiod as have been published; and frequently a view of the actors in the\r\ngreat drama and of their actions is obtained from this source, such as\r\ngrave historians, much to the loss of their readers, never give us. One\r\nof the best diaries of the kind is that of Lady Canning, as published\r\nin “The Story of Two Noble Lives,” by Augustus J. C. Hare. This journal\r\ngives us dainty little vignettes of the principal figures in the Mutiny,\r\nwith pictures of all the alternating moods of fear and hope, of triumph\r\nand despair, as, moment by moment, they were experienced by the little\r\ncircle of Government House in Calcutta. Here, for example, is a quaint\r\npicture of Havelock, which Lady Canning draws when the news reached\r\nCalcutta of his death:—\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 27._—We had a grievous piece of news from Alumbagh.\r\n    Havelock died two days ago. He died of dysentery, worn out\r\n    in mind and body.... It is curious now to remember how his\r\n    appointment was abused here, when he was called “an old fossil\r\n    dug up and only fit to be turned into pipe-clay.” I knew him\r\n    better than almost any one, and used to try and keep him in\r\n    good-humour when he seemed a little inclined to be affronted.\r\n    He was very small, and upright, and stiff, very white and grey,\r\n    and really like an iron ramrod. He always dined in his sword,\r\n    and made his son do the same. He wore more medals than ever\r\n    I saw on any one, and it was a joke that he looked as if he\r\n    carried all his money round his neck. He certainly must have\r\n    had eleven or twelve of those great round half-crown pieces.\r\n\r\nLady Canning goes on to picture Campbell’s march back to Cawnpore, with\r\nhis great convoy of wounded men and women and children, and her woman’s\r\nimagination fastens naturally on this long procession of helpless human\r\nbeings. “Sir Colin,” she writes, “has sent off four miles long of women\r\nand wounded!” Later on she reports the procession as fourteen miles\r\nlong! And no doubt the business of transporting such a host of helpless\r\ncreatures out of a city which contained 60,000 hostile troops, and across\r\nnearly fifty miles of an enemy’s country, was a feat calculated to\r\nimpress the human imagination.\r\n\r\nCampbell had one tremendous source of anxiety. He had to carry his\r\nhuge convoy of non-combatants, guns, treasure, and material across the\r\nslender, swaying line of boats which bridged the Ganges at Cawnpore\r\nbefore safety was reached. That bridge, indeed, formed his only possible\r\nline of retreat. If it were destroyed or fell into the enemy’s hands, the\r\ntragedy of Cabul—where only one man escaped out of an army—might have\r\nbeen repeated.\r\n\r\nCampbell had left Windham to guard the bridge and hold Cawnpore, but\r\nWindham had only 500 men—a force scarcely stronger in fighting power than\r\nthat with which Wheeler held the fatal entrenchments—and within easy\r\nstriking distance was the Gwalior contingent, numbering, with a fringe\r\nof irregulars, some 25,000 men, with forty guns, the most formidable\r\nand best-drilled force, on the Sepoy side, in the whole Mutiny. At its\r\nhead, too, was Tantia Topee, the one real soldier on the enemy’s side the\r\nMutiny produced, with quite enough warlike skill to see the opportunity\r\noffered him of striking a fatal blow at Campbell’s communications. If\r\nWindham’s scanty force had been crushed, and the bridge destroyed,\r\nCampbell’s position would have been, in a military sense, desperate, and\r\nthe tragedy of Cawnpore might have been repeated in darker colours and\r\non a vaster scale. Sound generalship required Campbell to smash the\r\nformidable force which threatened Cawnpore before advancing on Lucknow;\r\nbut Campbell took all risks in order to succour the beleaguered Residency.\r\n\r\nHaving plucked the beleaguered garrison out of the very heart of the\r\nenemy’s forces, it may be imagined with what eagerness Campbell now set\r\nhis face towards Cawnpore again. There was no safety for his helpless\r\nconvoy till the bridge was crossed. For days, too, all communications\r\nwith Windham had been intercepted. An ominous veil of unpierced silence\r\nhung between the retreating English and their base. Campbell set out from\r\nthe Alumbagh on the morning of November 27. All day the great column\r\ncrept along over the desolate plain towards the Ganges. At nightfall they\r\nhad reached Bunnee Bridge, and that “veil of silence” was for a moment\r\nlifted. Or, rather, through it there stole a faint deep sound, full of\r\nmenace, the voice of cannon answering cannon! Windham was attacked! He\r\nwas perhaps fighting for his life at the bridge-head!\r\n\r\nAll through the night those far-off and sullen vibrations told how\r\nthe fight was being maintained, and with what eagerness the march was\r\nresumed next morning may be guessed. Forbes-Mitchell relates how Campbell\r\naddressed the 93rd, and told them they must reach Cawnpore that night\r\nat all costs. The veteran was fond of taking his Highlanders into his\r\nconfidence; and he went on to explain:—\r\n\r\n    “If the bridge of boats should be captured before we got there\r\n    we would be cut off in Oude with 50,000 of our enemies in our\r\n    rear, a well-equipped army of 40,000 men, with a powerful train\r\n    of artillery, numbering over 40 siege guns, in our front, and\r\n    with all the women and children, sick and wounded to guard. So,\r\n    93rd,” said the grand old chief, “I don’t ask you to undertake\r\n    this forced march in your present tired condition without good\r\n    reason. You must reach Cawnpore to-night at all costs.” “All\r\n    right, Sir Colin,” shouted one voice after another from the\r\n    ranks; “we’ll do it!”\r\n\r\nThe men, it must be remembered, had not had their clothes off or changed\r\ntheir socks for eighteen days, and what a tax on the fortitude of the men\r\nthat forced march was, can hardly be realised. Alison tells the story\r\nvery graphically:—\r\n\r\n    Not a moment was to be lost. The danger was instant, and the\r\n    whole army eagerly pressed on towards the scene of danger. At\r\n    every step the sound of a heavy but distant cannonade became\r\n    more distinct; but mile after mile was passed over, and no news\r\n    could be obtained. The anxiety and impatience of all became\r\n    extreme. Louder and louder grew the roar—faster and faster\r\n    became the march—long and weary was the way—tired and footsore\r\n    grew the infantry—death fell on the exhausted wounded with\r\n    terrible rapidity—the travel-worn bearers could hardly stagger\r\n    along under their loads—the sick men groaned and died. But\r\n    still on, on, on, was the cry. Salvoes of artillery were fired\r\n    by the field battery of the advanced guard in hopes that its\r\n    sound might convey to the beleaguered garrison a promise of the\r\n    coming aid. At last some horsemen were seen spurring along\r\n    the road; then the veil which had for so long shrouded us from\r\n    Windham was rent asunder, and the disaster stood before us in\r\n    all its deformity.\r\n\r\nThe story of Windham’s disastrous fight at Cawnpore is a sort of bloody\r\nappendix to Campbell’s march on Lucknow. It must be told here to make the\r\ntale complete.\r\n\r\nWindham was a soldier of a fine, if not of the highest type, a man of\r\nimmense energy and of cool daring which, if it always saw the peril,\r\nscorned to turn aside on account of it. His sobriquet was “Redan”\r\nWindham, and no one who has read the story of how, on September 8, 1855,\r\nhe led the British stormers through the embrasures of the Redan can doubt\r\nthat Windham’s courage was of a lion-like quality. He was the first of\r\nthe stormers of the Second Division to cross the great ditch in front\r\nof the Redan, and the first to clamber through an embrasure. When his\r\nmen—young soldiers belonging to half-a-dozen separate regiments—hung back\r\nunder the great ramparts of the Redan, Windham thrice ran forward alone\r\nwith his brandished sword into the centre of the work, calling on the men\r\nto follow. He has told the story of how, again and again, he went back to\r\nhis men, patted them on the back, and begged them to follow him.\r\n\r\nFive times he sent to the rear for reinforcements, and it shows the\r\ncoolness of the man in the hell of that great fight that, determined at\r\nlast to go himself in search of additional troops, he first turned to an\r\nofficer standing near and asked his name. Then he said to him, “I have\r\nsent five times for support, now bear witness that I am not in a funk”—at\r\nwhich the officer smiled—“but I will now go back myself and see what I\r\ncan do.”\r\n\r\nHe went back, but before he could bring up new troops, the men still\r\nclinging to the Redan gave way, and the attack failed. Windham’s judgment\r\nwas challenged, but he was as brave as his own sword. He no doubt had his\r\nlimitations as an officer. Russell, a perfectly good critic, says that he\r\n“seemed always to have something to do in addition to something that he\r\nhad done already.” There was a certain note of hurry in his character,\r\nthat is, which does not add to the efficiency of a leader. His failing\r\nas an officer, Russell adds, was “reckless gallantry and dash”—grave\r\nfaults, no doubt, in a general, but faults which are not without their\r\ncompensations in a mere leader of fighting men. This was the man whom\r\nCampbell chose to keep the bridge at Cawnpore while he made his dash for\r\nthe relief of Lucknow.\r\n\r\nWindham’s force consisted of 500 men, made up of convalescent\r\nartillerymen, some sailors, and four companies of the 64th. Some\r\nearthworks had been thrown up to guard the bridge-head, but, in a\r\nmilitary sense, the position was scarcely defensible. Windham’s orders\r\nwere to forward with the utmost speed to Campbell all reinforcements as\r\nthey came up; to keep a vigilant watch on the Gwalior contingent, and\r\nhold the bridge to his last man and the last cartridge.\r\n\r\nWindham sent on the reinforcements for a time, loyally, but as the\r\nGwalior contingent—which had now been joined by Nana Sahib and all his\r\nforces—began to press more menacingly upon him, he strengthened himself\r\nby holding the troops as they came up; until, at the moment when the\r\nfight commenced, he had a force of some 1700 men. On November 19, the\r\nGwalior contingent and their allies were distributed in a semicircle\r\nround Cawnpore—the nearest body being fifteen miles distant, the main\r\nbody some twenty-five miles off.\r\n\r\nWindham, always disposed to attack rather than wait to be attacked, first\r\nformed a plan for leaping on these hostile forces in detail. He could\r\nmove from the interior of the circle; they were scattered round a segment\r\nof its circumference. Windham left 300 men to hold the bridge-head, and,\r\nwith the main body of his force, took a position outside the town, in\r\nreadiness for his dash. Two divisions of the enemy were about fifteen\r\nmiles to the north, on either side of a canal running parallel to the\r\nGanges. Windham proposed to place 1200 men in boats on the canal at\r\nnightfall, quietly steal up through the darkness, and in the morning leap\r\non the enemy on either bank in turn and destroy them, then fall swiftly\r\nback on his base.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty plan, but Tantia Topee had his military ideas too. He\r\nthrust forward the Gwalior contingent along the road from the west, and\r\non November 25 their leading division crossed the Pando River only three\r\nmiles from Windham’s camp outside Cawnpore. Windham promptly swung round\r\nto his left, marched fiercely out—1200 men with eight guns against 20,000\r\nwith twenty-five guns—and fell impetuously on the head of the enemy’s\r\nnearest column. He crumpled it up with the energy of his stroke, and\r\ndrove it, a confused mass, in retreat, leaving three guns in Windham’s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nBut from a ridge of high ground Windham was able to see the real strength\r\nof the enemy. He had crushed its leading division of 3000 men, but behind\r\nthem was the main body of 17,000 men with twenty guns moving steadily\r\nforward. Windham’s killed and wounded already amounted to nearly 100\r\nmen, and he had no choice but to fall back. His scanty little battery of\r\nsix light guns, with undrilled gunners, could not endure the fire of the\r\nheavy artillery opposed to them.\r\n\r\nWindham, with characteristic tenacity, would not abandon the city and\r\nfall back on his entrenchments. He took a position on open ground outside\r\nthe town, across what was called the Calpee road—the road, that is,\r\nrunning to the north—and waited the development of the enemy’s plans. In\r\nthe town were enormous stores—the supplies for Campbell’s force, with\r\nWindham’s own baggage. He ought, no doubt, to have sent all these back\r\nto the entrenchments, and he admitted afterwards that he had blundered in\r\nnot doing so; and the blunder cost the British force dearly.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 27th dawned, and Windham stood to arms. He could get\r\nno information as to the enemy’s movements. He had no cavalry, and his\r\nspies crept back to him horribly mutilated. He could only wait for Tantia\r\nTopee’s stroke. That general proved throughout the day that he had a good\r\nsoldierly head, and could frame a clever and daring plan of battle.\r\n\r\nWindham expected to be assailed on his left flank. But at ten o’clock\r\nthe roar of cannon broke out on his right and on his front. A strong\r\nrebel force moving on the Calpee road from the north struck heavily on\r\nWindham’s front, while a yet stronger force coming in from the east\r\nthrew itself on his right flank. It was in the main an artillery attack,\r\nand the rebel fire was of overwhelming fury. At the front, the 88th\r\n(the Connaught Rangers) and the Rifles, with a battery of four guns,\r\nheld their own valiantly. Some companies of the 82nd and the 34th held\r\nthe right flank, and here, too, the fight was gallantly sustained. Two\r\nbattles, in brief, were in progress at the same moment, and at each of\r\nthe assailed points the British numbered scarcely 600 bayonets, with two\r\nor three guns, while at each point the artillery fire of the enemy was of\r\nterrific severity.\r\n\r\nFor nearly five hours the tumult and passion of the battle raged. At the\r\nfront the British ammunition began, at last, to fail, the native drivers\r\ndeserted, and Windham found it necessary to withdraw two companies from\r\nhis right flank to strengthen his front. At that moment he discovered\r\nthat Tantia Topee—who up to this stage had maintained the fight chiefly\r\nwith his artillery, and had with great skill gathered a heavy mass of\r\ninfantry on the left flank of the British—was developing a third attack\r\nat that point. He thrust his infantry, that is, past Windham’s left,\r\nand tried to seize the town, so as to cut off the fighting front of the\r\nBritish from the bridge.\r\n\r\nTwo companies of the 64th were brought up from the scanty garrison at the\r\nbridge-head to check this dangerous movement; and then Windham found that\r\nthe enemy had broken in on his right flank, and were in possession of the\r\nlower portions of the town!\r\n\r\nWindham was out-generalled, and had no choice but to fall back on his\r\nentrenchments, and he had to do this through narrow streets and broken\r\nground while attacked in front and on both flanks by a victorious enemy\r\nten times stronger than himself in bayonets, and more than ten times\r\nstronger in artillery. Adye says that the retreat to the entrenchments\r\n“was made in perfect order, and not a man was lost in the operation”;\r\nbut on this subject there is the wildest conflict of evidence. Moore,\r\nthe chaplain of Windham’s force, says “the men got quite out of hand,\r\nand fled pell-mell for the fort. An old Sikh officer at the gate tried\r\nto stop them and to form them up in some order, and when they pushed\r\nhim aside and brushed past him he lifted up his hands and said, ‘You\r\nare not the brothers of the men who beat the Khalsa army and conquered\r\nthe Punjab!’” Mr. Moore goes on to say that “the old Sikh followed the\r\nflying men through the fort gate, and, patting some of them on the back,\r\nsaid, ‘Don’t run, don’t be afraid; there is nothing to hurt you.’” If\r\nthere was disorder the excuse is that the men were, for the most part,\r\nyoung soldiers without regimental cohesion—they were mere fragments of\r\nhalf-a-dozen regiments—they had been for five hours under an overwhelming\r\nartillery fire, and were exhausted with want of food: and a retreat under\r\nsuch conditions, and through a hostile city, might well have taxed the\r\nsteadiness of the best troops in the world. As a matter of fact, the men\r\nof the 64th, the 34th, and the 82nd held together with the steadiness\r\nof veterans, and their slow and stubborn retreat, their fierce volleys\r\nand occasional dashes with the bayonets, quite cooled the ardour of the\r\nmutineers as they followed the retreating British.\r\n\r\nAt one point, indeed, on the right flank of the British there was a clear\r\ncase of misconduct, and the culprit was an officer. His name in all the\r\npublished reports is concealed under the charity of asterisks. Campbell,\r\nin his despatch, says:—“Lieut.-Colonel * * * misconducted himself on the\r\n26th and 27th November in a manner which has rarely been seen amongst\r\nthe officers of Her Majesty’s service; his conduct was pusillanimous and\r\nimbecile to the last degree, and he actually gave orders for the retreat\r\nof his own regiment, and a portion of another, in the very face of the\r\norders of his General, and when the troops were not seriously pressed by\r\nthe enemy.”\r\n\r\nEvery man who wears a red coat and a pair of epaulettes is not\r\nnecessarily a hero, and human courage, at best, is a somewhat unstable\r\nelement. This particular officer had risen to high rank and seen much\r\nservice, but some failure of nerve, some sudden clouding of brain, in the\r\nstress of that desperate fight, made him play—if only for a moment—the\r\npart both of an imbecile and a coward, and surrender a position which was\r\nessential to the British defence. He was court-martialled after the fight\r\nand dismissed the service.\r\n\r\nWindham’s retreat involved the sacrifice of all the military stores\r\nin the town, a great supply of ammunition, the mess plate, and the\r\npaymaster’s chests and baggage of four Queen’s regiments, &c. Some 500\r\ntents, as one item alone, were turned into a huge bonfire that night\r\nby the exultant rebels. But, though Windham had fallen back to the\r\nentrenchments at the bridge-head, he was as ready for fight as ever. He\r\nheld a council of his officers that night and proposed to sally out under\r\ncover of darkness and fall on the enemy, a proposal which at least proves\r\nthe unquenchable quality of his courage.\r\n\r\nThis plan was not adopted, but, it being discovered that a gun had been\r\noverturned and abandoned in the streets of the city, Windham sent out 100\r\nmen of the 64th, with a few sailors, to bring that gun in. It was a feat\r\nof singular daring, carried out with singular success, and this is how\r\nthe story of it is told by an officer who took part in the adventure:—\r\n\r\n    We marched off under the guidance of a native, who said he\r\n    would take us to the spot where the gun lay. We told him he\r\n    should be well rewarded if he brought us to the gun, but if he\r\n    brought us into a trap we had a soldier by him “at full cock”\r\n    ready to blow his brains out. We passed our outside pickets,\r\n    and entered the town through very narrow streets without a\r\n    single Sepoy being seen, or a shot fired on either side. We\r\n    crept along. Not a soul spoke a word. All was still as death;\r\n    and after marching this way into the very heart of the town our\r\n    guide brought us to the very spot where the gun was capsized.\r\n    The soldiers were posted on each side, and then we went to\r\n    work. Not a man spoke above his breath, and each stone was laid\r\n    down quietly. When we thought we had cleared enough I ordered\r\n    the men to put their shoulders to the wheel and gun, and when\r\n    all was ready and every man had his pound before him I said\r\n    “Heave!” and up she righted. We then limbered up, called the\r\n    soldiers to follow, and we marched into the entrenchment with\r\n    our gun without a shot being fired.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 28th, Windham, still bent on “aggressive defence,”\r\nsallied out to fight the enemy in the open—or rather on either flank. On\r\nthe left front the Rifles and the 82nd, under Walpole, thrashed the enemy\r\nin a most satisfactory manner, capturing two 18-pounders. On the right,\r\nthe 64th and the 34th, under Carthew, fought for hours with desperate\r\ncourage. General Wilson, in particular, led two companies of the 64th\r\nin a very audacious attempt to capture a battery of the enemy. Wilson\r\nhimself was killed, and two officers of the 64th—Stirling and McCrae—were\r\neach cut down in the act of spiking one of the enemy’s guns, and the\r\nattempt, though gallant as anything recorded in the history of war,\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nWhen evening came the British had fallen back to their entrenchments,\r\nupon which a heavy fire, both of artillery and small arms, was poured.\r\nThe enemy was in complete possession of the town, and, planting some guns\r\non the bank of the river, tried to destroy the bridge. “The dust of no\r\nsuccouring columns,” says Alison, “could be seen rising from the plains\r\nof Oude, and the sullen plunge of round shot into the river by the bridge\r\nshowed by how frail a link they were bound to the opposite bank, whence\r\nonly aid could arrive.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly at this dramatic moment Campbell himself—who had pushed ahead of\r\nhis column—made his appearance with his staff on the scene. Says Alison:—\r\n\r\n    The clatter of a few horsemen was suddenly heard passing over\r\n    the bridge and ascending at a rapid pace the road which leads\r\n    to the fort. As they came close under the ramparts, an old man\r\n    with grey hair was seen to be riding at their head. One of the\r\n    soldiers recognised the commander-in-chief; the news spread\r\n    like wildfire: the men, crowding upon the parapet, sent forth\r\n    cheer after cheer. The enemy, surprised at the commotion, for a\r\n    few moments ceased their fire. The old man rode in through the\r\n    gate. All felt then that the crisis was over—that the Residency\r\n    saved, would not now be balanced by Cawnpore lost.\r\n\r\nA characteristic incident marked Campbell’s arrival. A guard of the 82nd\r\nheld a hastily constructed _tête de pont_ which covered the bridge, and\r\nits officer, in answer to Campbell’s inquiry as to how matters stood,\r\nreplied with undiplomatic bluntness that “the garrison was at its last\r\ngasp.” At this announcement the too irascible Sir Colin simply exploded.\r\n“He flew at the wretched man,” says Lord Roberts, “as he was sometimes\r\napt to do when greatly put out, rating him soundly, and asking him ‘how\r\nhe dared to say of Her Majesty’s troops that they were at the last\r\ngasp!’” This, in Campbell’s ears, was mere egregious and incredible\r\ntreason!\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of Campbell and his convoy, and the splendid little\r\nfighting force he commanded, the story of what happened at Cawnpore\r\nbecomes very pleasant reading. On the morning of the 30th, the further\r\nbank of the Ganges was white with the tents and black with the masses\r\nof Campbell’s force. With what wrath Campbell’s soldiers looked across\r\nthe river and saw all their baggage ascending, in the shape of clouds of\r\nblack smoke, to the sky may be guessed, but not described. Many wrathful\r\ncamp expletives, no doubt, followed the upward curling smoke!\r\n\r\nPeel’s heavy guns were swung round, and opened in fierce duel with the\r\nenemy’s battery firing on the bridge. One of the first shots fired from\r\none of Peel’s 24-pounders struck the gun which Nana Sahib had at last got\r\nto bear upon the bridge, and dismounted it. An 8-inch shell next dropped\r\namongst a crowd of his troops, and they quickly fell back. Then the\r\nBritish troops commenced to file across the river, still under the fire\r\nof the enemy. The enemy’s advance batteries were quickly driven back, and\r\nthe great convoy began to creep over the bridge.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-six hours the long procession of sick and wounded, of women\r\nand children, of guns and baggage crept across the swaying bridge. On\r\nthe night of the 29th, the mutineers tried to interrupt the process by\r\nsending down fire-rafts upon the bridge. Tried earlier, the scheme might\r\nhave succeeded, or tried even then with greater skill and daring, it\r\nmight have had some chance of success; as it was, it failed ignobly,\r\nand the endless stream of non-combatants was brought over the river\r\ninto safety. Campbell, for all his fire of courage—and it may be\r\nadded of temper—had an ample measure of Scottish coolness, and he kept\r\nquietly within his lines for five days till his helpless convoy had been\r\ndespatched under escort to Allahabad, and was beyond reach of hostile\r\nattack. Then, with his force in perfect fighting form, he addressed\r\nhimself to the task of crushing the enemy opposed to him.\r\n\r\nHis own force, steadily fed by reinforcements, by this time numbered\r\n5000 infantry, 600 sailors, and 35 guns; that of the enemy amounted\r\nto something like 25,000 men with 40 guns. Nana Sahib, with his mass\r\nof somewhat irregular troops, occupied the left wing between the city\r\nand the river; the Gwalior contingent, still formidable in numbers and\r\nmilitary efficiency, occupied the town as a centre, and formed the\r\nenemy’s right wing, thrust out into the plain towards the canal. It was\r\na very strong position. The enemy’s left, perched on high wooded hills,\r\nwas covered with nullahs and scattered buildings. An attack on their\r\ncentre could only be made through the narrow and crooked streets of the\r\ncity, and was therefore almost impossible. But their right lay open to\r\nCampbell’s stroke, and if turned it would be thrust off the Calpee road,\r\nits only line of retreat.\r\n\r\nCampbell’s strategy was simple, yet skilful. Alison, indeed, says,\r\nsomewhat absurdly, that it will “bear comparison with any of the\r\nmasterpieces of Napoleon or Wellington.” Kaye, too, says that the plan of\r\nthis battle “establishes the right of Sir Colin Campbell to be regarded\r\nas a great commander.” Whether these somewhat high-flown eulogiums\r\nare justifiable may perhaps be doubted; but Campbell’s plan certainly\r\nsucceeded. Campbell, in brief, fixed the attention of the enemy on their\r\nleft wing—the one he did not mean to attack—by opening on it on the\r\nmorning of the 6th with the roar of artillery. He paralysed the centre\r\nwith a feigned infantry assault, under Greathed. Then by a swift and\r\nunexpected attack he shattered the enemy’s right wing, at once smiting it\r\nin front and turning its flank.\r\n\r\nThe drifting clouds of battle-smoke helped him to concentrate,\r\nunobserved, on his left, a strong force consisting of Hope, with the\r\nSikhs, the 53rd, the 42nd, the 93rd, and Inglis with the 23rd, the 32nd,\r\nand 82nd.\r\n\r\nThe iron hail of Campbell’s guns smote the town cruelly, while the\r\nrattle of Greathed’s musketry formed a sort of sharp treble to the\r\nhoarse diapason of the artillery. Presently, through the white drifting\r\nsmoke of the guns, came the Rifles, under Walpole, firing on the edge\r\nof the town, to Greathed’s left. Campbell was still keeping back his\r\nreal stroke, and this clatter of artillery and musketry, and the clouds\r\nof drifting battle-smoke, held the senses of the enemy. Suddenly, from\r\nbehind a cluster of buildings on the British left, line after line of\r\ninfantry moved quickly out. It was Hope’s and Inglis’s brigades, which,\r\nin parallel columns of companies, left in front, now—to quote the\r\nlanguage of an eye-witness—“shot out and streamed on, wave after wave of\r\nglittering bayonets, till they stretched far across into the plain, while\r\nthe cavalry and horse artillery, trotting rapidly out, pushed on beyond\r\nthem, raising clouds of dust, and covering their advance.”\r\n\r\nCampbell’s plan was now developed, and the enemy opened all their guns\r\nwith the utmost fury on the steady lines of the two brigades. At a given\r\nsignal, the British columns swung round, formed front to the enemy’s\r\nposition, and, in perfect order, as Alison puts it, “swept on with a\r\nproud, majestic movement” against a cluster of high brick mounds which\r\ncovered the bridge across the canal—both bridge and mounds being held\r\nin great force by the enemy. “Grouped in masses behind the mounds, the\r\nrebels fired sharply, while their guns, worked with great precision and\r\nenergy, sent a storm of shot and shell upon the plain, over which, like\r\na drifting storm, came the stout skirmishers of the Sikhs and the 53rd,\r\ncovering their front with the flashes of a bickering musketry, behind\r\nwhom rolled in a long and serried line the 93rd and 42nd, sombre with\r\ntheir gloomy plumes and dark tartans, followed, some hundred yards in\r\nrear, by the thin ranks of Inglis’s brigade.”\r\n\r\nThe skirmishers quickly cleared the mounds, and the Sikhs and the\r\nHighlanders went forward at a run to the bridge. It was held with fierce\r\ncourage by the enemy. A sleet of shot swept along its entire length. It\r\nseemed to be barred as by a thousand dancing points of flame—the flash of\r\nmusketry and the red flames of the great guns.\r\n\r\nAs Sikhs and Highlanders, however, pressed sternly forward, they heard\r\nbehind them the tramp of many feet and the clatter of wheels. It was Peel\r\nwith his sailors bringing up a 24-pounder. They came up at a run, the\r\nblue-jackets “tailing on” to the ropes, and clutching with eager hands\r\nthe spokes of the wheels. The gun was swung round on the very bridge\r\nitself, and sent its grape hurtling into the ranks of the Sepoys on the\r\nfurther side. Sikhs and Highlanders kindled to flame at the sight of that\r\ndaring act. With a shout they ran past the gun, and across the bridge;\r\nsome leaped into the canal, splashed through its waters and clambered up\r\nthe further bank. The bridge was carried! A battery of field artillery\r\ncame up at the gallop, thundered across its shaking planks, and, swinging\r\nround, opened fire on the tents of the Gwalior contingent, while the two\r\nbrigades pressed eagerly forward on the broken enemy.\r\n\r\nForbes-Mitchell, who fought that day in the ranks of the 93rd, gives a\r\nvery picturesque description of the combat. Campbell, who was almost\r\nas fond of making speeches as Havelock, and understood perfectly how\r\nto stir the blood of his men, gave a brief address to the 93rd before\r\nlaunching the turning movement. He gave the Highlanders one somewhat\r\nquaint warning. There was a huge accumulation of rum, Campbell said, in\r\nthe enemy’s camp; it had been drugged, he added, by the enemy, and no man\r\nmust touch it. “But, 93rd!” he said, “I trust you! Leave that rum alone!”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, when the men swept with a rush across the canal,\r\nthey found the rum against which Sir Colin had warned them standing—great\r\ncasks with their heads knocked out for the convenience of intending\r\ndrunkards—in front of the enemy’s camp, with their infantry drawn up in\r\ncolumns behind them. “There is no doubt,” says Forbes-Mitchell, “that the\r\nenemy expected the British would break their ranks when they saw the rum,\r\nand make a rush for it, and they made careful and tempting provision for\r\nthat contingency.” That expectation forms a somewhat severe commentary on\r\nthe thirsty character the British private had won for himself in India!\r\n\r\nThe 93rd, however, virtuously marched past the rum barrels, while the\r\nsupernumerary rank, as Campbell had ordered, upset the barrels and poured\r\ntheir contents out. It was, fortunately, _not_ whisky! Forbes-Mitchell,\r\nagain, describes how, covered by the heavy fire of Peel’s guns, their\r\nline advanced, with the pipers playing and the colours in front of the\r\ncentre company. “By the time,” he says, “we reached the canal, Peel’s\r\nblue-jackets were calling out, ‘⸺ these cow-horses’—meaning the gun\r\nbullocks. ‘Come, you 93rd! Give us a hand with the drag-ropes as you\r\ndid at Lucknow;’” and a company of the 93rd slung their rifles and\r\ndashed to the help of the blue-jackets! The sailors gave a vehement\r\ncheer for “the red and blue,” and some well-known vocalist in the ranks\r\nof the 93rd struck up a familiar camp-song with that title, and, says\r\nForbes-Mitchell, “the whole line, including the skirmishers of the 53rd\r\nand the sailors,” joined with stentorian voices in singing—\r\n\r\n    “Come, all you gallant British hearts,\r\n    Who love the red and blue!”\r\n\r\nThe British line swept across the enemy’s camp, and so complete was the\r\nsurprise, so unexpected was the onslaught, that the chupatties were\r\nfound in the very process of being cooked upon the fires, the bullocks\r\nstood tied behind the hackeries, the sick and wounded were lying in the\r\nhospitals. The smith left the forge and the surgeon his patient to fly\r\nfrom the avenging bayonets. Every tent was found exactly as its late\r\noccupants had sprung from it.\r\n\r\nBeyond the camp the Gwalior contingent had rallied, and stood drawn up\r\nin steady lines. The eagerly advancing British line—to the wonder of the\r\nmen—was halted. Suddenly through some fields of tall sugar-cane the 9th\r\nLancers came galloping, and behind them, masked by the close lines of\r\nthe Lancers, was a field battery. When the enemy saw the gleaming tips\r\nof the British lances, they fell instantly into squares of brigades,\r\nand opened fire on the cavalry at a distance of about three hundred\r\nyards. “Just as they commenced to fire,” says Forbes-Mitchell, “we could\r\nhear Sir Hope Grant, in a voice as loud as a trumpet, give the command\r\nto the cavalry, ‘Squadrons outwards!’ while Bourchier gave the order to\r\nhis gunners, ‘Action front!’ The cavalry wheeled as if they had been at\r\na review on the Calcutta parade-ground, and thus uncovered the guns.”\r\nThe guns, charged with grape, were swung round, unlimbered as quick as\r\nlightning within about 250 yards of the squares, and round after round of\r\ngrape was poured into the enemy with murderous effect, every charge going\r\nright through, leaving a lane of dead from four to five yards wide. The\r\nHighlanders could see the mounted officers of the enemy, as soon as they\r\ncaught sight of the guns, dash out of the squares, and fly like lightning\r\nacross the plain!\r\n\r\nThe victory, in a word, was complete. The Gwalior contingent was\r\ndestroyed as a military force: its camp, magazines, and guns fell into\r\nthe hands of the British, and Campbell urged a furious pursuit of the\r\nbroken soldiery along the Calpee road. For fourteen miles the cavalry\r\nand horse artillery rode at the gallop, capturing ammunition waggons and\r\nbaggage carts, dispersing and slaying such of the infantry as still tried\r\nto keep some formation, till at last the panting rebels flung away their\r\narms, and fled into the jungle, or crouched in the fields of sugar-cane,\r\nseeking cover from the red sabres and lances of the horsemen. The enemy’s\r\ncentre had no choice but to abandon the town, and fall hurriedly back and\r\nmelt into the general stream of fugitives.\r\n\r\nNana Sahib, with the left wing, had the Bithoor road, diverging widely\r\nfrom the Calpee road, for his line of retreat, and Campbell pushed\r\nforward a strong force under General Mansfield, his chief of staff, to\r\nthrust the flying enemy off that road.\r\n\r\nMansfield was a brave man, singularly expert in the routine work of\r\na military office, but quite unfitted for the rough shock of the\r\nbattlefield. For one thing, he was very short-sighted, and, as Malleson\r\nputs it, “was too proud to trust to the sight of others.” He reached the\r\npoint where he commanded the road, but halted his men, stared with dim\r\nand spectacled eyes at the stream of fugitives, with their guns, and\r\nallowed it all to flow past him undisturbed and unpursued. Nana Sahib\r\nhimself, as it happened, rode somewhere amongst the fugitives, unsmitten\r\nby British lead! Campbell had to despatch Hope Grant the next day along\r\nthe Bithoor road, in pursuit of this wing of the fugitives, and that fine\r\nsoldier overtook the flying enemy after a march of twenty-five miles,\r\ncaptured all their guns, and tumbled them into hopeless ruin.\r\n\r\nCampbell’s victory was splendid and memorable. With 5000 men he had\r\noverthrown 25,000, captured thirty-two guns and the whole of their\r\nbaggage, and driven his enemy in flying rout along two diverging lines\r\nof retreat. And it was a victory won rather by the brains of the general\r\nthan by the bayonets of the soldiers. Campbell’s entire loss in killed\r\nwas only ninety-nine of all ranks. The army of 25,000 Campbell overthrew\r\nso utterly, it must be remembered, included the best-trained and most\r\nperfectly-equipped native force in all India—the Gwalior contingent, at\r\nleast 10,000 strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDELHI: HOW THE RIDGE WAS HELD\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the passion, the tragedy, and the glory of the Indian Mutiny\r\ngathers round three great sieges. We vaguely remember a hundred tales\r\nof individual adventure elsewhere on the great stage of the Mutiny; we\r\nhave perhaps a still fainter and more ghostly mental image of the combats\r\nHavelock fought on the road to Lucknow, and the battles by which Campbell\r\ncrushed this body of rebels or that. But it is all a mist of confused\r\nrecollections, a kaleidoscope of fast-fading pictures. But who does not\r\nremember the three great sieges of the Mutiny—Cawnpore, Lucknow, Delhi?\r\nThe very names are like beacon lights flaming through leagues of night!\r\n\r\nAt Cawnpore the British were besieged and destroyed, a tragedy due to\r\nWheeler’s fatal blunder in choosing the site where the British were to\r\nmake their stand for life, and his failure in collecting provisions for\r\nthe siege. At Lucknow, again, the British were besieged, but triumphed,\r\nbecoming themselves in turn the besiegers. Success here was due to the\r\ngenius of Henry Lawrence in organising the defences of the Residency,\r\nand his energy in storing supplies before the Mutiny broke out. The\r\nbrave men who died behind Wheeler’s ridges of earth, or in the Slaughter\r\nGhaut at Cawnpore, showed valour as lofty and enduring as that of the men\r\nwho held the Residency with such invincible courage at Lucknow. But the\r\ninterval between the tragedy at Cawnpore and the triumph at Lucknow is\r\nmeasured by the difference between the two leaders, Wheeler and Lawrence.\r\nBoth were brave men, but Lawrence was a great captain.\r\n\r\nAt Delhi the British, from the outset, were the besiegers, and nothing\r\nin British history—not the story of Sir Richard Grenville and the\r\n_Revenge_, of the Fusileers at Albuera, or of the Guards at Inkerman—is\r\na more kindling tale of endurance and valour than the story of how for\r\nmonths a handful of British clung to the Ridge outside Delhi, fighting\r\ndaily with foes ten times more numerous than themselves, and yet\r\nbesieging—or maintaining the show of besieging—the great city which was\r\nthe nerve-centre and heart of the whole Mutiny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD LAWRENCE\r\n\r\n_Reproduced from the Life of Lord Lawrence by permission R. BOSWORTH\r\nSMITH, Esq._]\r\n\r\nAt Cawnpore and Lucknow the British fought for existence. At Delhi they\r\nfought for empire! While the British flag flew from the Ridge at Delhi\r\nit was a symbol that the British _raj_ was still undestroyed. It was a\r\nred gleaming menace of punishment to all rebels. Had that flag fallen\r\nfor twenty-four hours, India, for a time at least, would have been lost\r\nto England. But it flew proudly and threateningly aloft, undestroyed by\r\na hundred attacks, till at last Nicholson led his stormers through the\r\nCashmere Gate, and the fate of the Mutiny was sealed!\r\n\r\nThe mutineers from Meerut rode into Delhi on May 11. It was the city\r\nof the Great Mogul. It appealed by a thousand memories to both the\r\nrace-pride and the fanaticism of the revolted Sepoys. Here the Mutiny\r\nfound, not only a natural stronghold, but an official head, and Delhi\r\nthus became a far-seen signal of revolt to the whole of Northern India.\r\nBut on June 7—or less than four weeks after Willoughby in heroic despair\r\nblew up the great magazine at Delhi—Sir Henry Barnard’s microscopic army\r\nmade its appearance on the Ridge, and the siege of Delhi began. It was\r\na real stroke of military genius that thus, from the earliest outbreak\r\nof the Mutiny, kept a bayonet, so to speak, pointed threateningly at its\r\nvery heart!\r\n\r\nAnd the hero of the siege of Delhi is not Barnard, or Wilson, or\r\nBaird-Smith, or Neville Chamberlain, or Nicholson—but a man who never\r\nfired a shot or struck a sword-stroke in the actual siege itself—John\r\nLawrence. Lawrence, and not Havelock, nor Outram, nor Canning, was the\r\ntrue saviour of the British _raj_ in India in the wild days of the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nJohn Lawrence was five years younger than his gallant brother Henry,\r\nwho died in the Residency at Lucknow. He had no visible gleam of the\r\nbrilliancy which makes Henry Lawrence a character so attractive. Up to\r\nmiddle life, indeed, John Lawrence was a silent, inarticulate, rugged\r\nman, with the reputation of being a great worker, but whom nobody\r\nsuspected to be a genius, and for whom nobody—least of all Lawrence\r\nhimself—dreamed fame was waiting. He came of that strong-bodied,\r\nstrong-brained, masterful race of which the North of Ireland is the\r\ncradle. But England, Ireland, and Scotland all had a share in the\r\nmaking of John Lawrence. He was actually born in England. His father\r\nwas a gallant Irish soldier, who led the forlorn hope at the storming\r\nof Seringapatam. His mother was a lineal descendant of John Knox, the\r\nScottish reformer. And perhaps the characteristic traits of the three\r\ncountries never met more happily in a single human character than in John\r\nLawrence. In Ulster he was known amongst his schoolmates as “English\r\nJohn.” At Haileybury, in England, he was looked upon as a typical\r\nIrishman.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, he was Englishman, Irishman, Scotchman all in one. He had\r\nCeltic glow and fire under a crust of Scottish silence and caution; and\r\nhe added the Englishman’s steady intelligence and passion for justice to\r\nScottish hard-headedness and the generous daring of the Irish character.\r\nOr, to put the matter in a different way, in any perilous crisis he\r\ncould survey the situation with the balanced judgment of an Englishman;\r\ncould choose his course with the shrewd and calculating sagacity of a\r\nScotchman; then carry it out with Irish fire and daring!\r\n\r\nLawrence shone as a youth neither in studies nor in games, and both\r\nas a youth and man he had a magnificent faculty for silence. By blood\r\nand genius he was a soldier. But duty was the supreme law of life for\r\nhim; and at the bidding of what he deemed to be duty, he surrendered\r\na soldier’s career and entered the Indian Civil Service. His silent\r\nenergy, his strong brain, his passion for work, his chivalrous loyalty\r\nto righteousness, quickly assured him a great career. He was above the\r\nmiddle height, strongly built, with an eager, forward gait. His massive\r\nhead gave him a sort of kingly look—the forehead broad, the eyes deep-set\r\nand grey, but with a gleam in them as of a sword-blade. The firm lips had\r\na saddened curve; the face was ploughed deep with furrows of thought and\r\nwork. His voice, when his feelings were aroused, had a singular resonance\r\nand timbre, and his whole aspect was that of silent, half-melancholy\r\nsimplicity and strength.\r\n\r\nBut Lawrence was exactly the man for a great crisis. He had a kingly\r\nfaculty for choosing fit instruments. He saw with perfect clearness\r\nevery detail of the visible landscape; but he had also that subtler\r\nvision—which only great poets and great statesmen possess—of the\r\ntendencies and forces which underlie external facts and determine their\r\nflow. The Celtic element in him, perhaps, gave Lawrence that rare and\r\nsubtle faculty; but by virtue of his Scottish strain he was essentially a\r\nman of action. He could grasp a great purpose with a hand of steel, and\r\nhold it unshaken through all the shocks of conflict and adversity.\r\n\r\nLawrence, it may be added, was pre-eminently fortunate in his officers.\r\nPartly by the attraction which draws like to like, and partly by his\r\nown rare genius for choosing fit instruments, he had gathered round him\r\na group of splendid soldiers and administrators, all in the prime of\r\nlife. Nicholson, for example, was only thirty-five; Edwardes and Neville\r\nChamberlain only thirty-seven. The general average of age, indeed, on\r\nLawrence’s staff was much below that of India in general. All the energy\r\nof youth, in brief, was in Lawrence’s men; all the sagacity of ripest\r\nstatesmanship was in Lawrence himself.\r\n\r\nLawrence’s contribution to the history of the Mutiny must be compressed\r\ninto a dozen sentences. In 1857 he was Chief Commissioner of the Punjaub,\r\nthe “land of the five rivers,” with a population of 20,000,000. The\r\nPunjaub was newly-conquered territory; its population was the most\r\nwarlike in India; its frontiers marched for 800 miles with those of\r\nAfghanistan, and the hill passes were held by wild Moslem clans always\r\nready to storm down with clattering shield and gleaming spear on the fat,\r\ndefenceless plains at their feet. In eight years, under the _régime_ of\r\nthe Lawrences, the Punjaub was rendered orderly, loyal, and prosperous;\r\nwhile the Punjaub Frontier Force, a body of 12,000 men, which kept the\r\nmountain tribes in order, was perhaps the first body of native troops\r\nwhich ever followed British officers into battle.\r\n\r\nThen came the cataclysm of the Mutiny. As with the shock of an\r\nearthquake, British rule in Northern India seemed to crumble to the\r\nground, and British officers who yesterday were rulers of kingdoms and\r\ncities, were to-day fugitives, or fighting in tiny and broken clusters\r\nfor their lives. The Mutiny, too, cut Oude and the Punjaub off from the\r\ncentre of authority at Calcutta. For weeks no whisper from the outside\r\nworld reached Lawrence. He was left to keep his own head and shape his\r\nown policy.\r\n\r\nHis policy may be told almost in a sentence. He anticipated mutiny, and\r\noutpaced it. He disarmed with iron resolution and swift decision all\r\nthe Sepoy regiments whose loyalty was doubtful, and put all the forts,\r\narsenals, treasuries, and strategic points in the Punjaub under the guard\r\nof British bayonets. Then he organised a movable column of European\r\ntroops—scanty in dimensions, but of the finest fighting quality—under\r\nthe command, first, of Neville Chamberlain, and next of Nicholson; and\r\nthis force stood ready to strike at any point where mutiny threatened to\r\nlift its head. In the Punjaub, that is, mutiny was anticipated, robbed\r\nof weapons and left helpless, and under the ceaseless menace of the\r\nlight-footed, almost ubiquitous, movable column.\r\n\r\nNext, having dismissed into air, as with a gesture of his hand, the army\r\nwhose loyalty was tainted, Lawrence had to create another native army,\r\nwith loyalty above reproach. And from the wild mountain clans and the\r\nSikhs—themselves a conquered people—Lawrence actually created a new army,\r\nnearly 50,000 strong, with which he was able to crush the very Sepoys\r\nwho, under British leadership, had been the conquerors of the Punjaub!\r\n\r\nLawrence’s genius and masterful will, too, determined the whole strategy\r\nto be employed for the suppression of the Mutiny. He settled the question\r\nthat Delhi must be instantly besieged. He formed a military base for the\r\nsiege at Umballa, a distance of a hundred miles, and he kept sleepless\r\nguard over that long line of communications. He fed the besieging force\r\nwith supplies and munitions of every kind; reinforced it with, first, his\r\nown frontier troops, the famous Guides and the Ghoorkas, and, later, with\r\nhis own movable column. He cast into the scale against Delhi, in effect,\r\nhis last coin, his last cartridge, and his last man. And in that terrible\r\ngame, on which hung the fate of the British rule in India, Lawrence won!\r\n“Through him,” wrote Lord Canning, “Delhi fell.” And the fall of Delhi\r\nrang the knell of the Mutiny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SIR HERBERT B. EDWARDES, K.C.B., K.C.S.I.\r\n\r\n_From a lithograph_]\r\n\r\nOnce, it is true, even John Lawrence’s iron courage seemed to give way,\r\nor, rather, the strain of the peril threw his cool judgment off its\r\nbalance. The fate of India visibly hung on Delhi. The force on the Ridge\r\nwas absurdly inadequate for its task, and Lawrence conceived the idea\r\nthat, to succeed at Delhi, it would be necessary to abandon Peshawur,\r\ngive up the Punjaub to Dost Mohammed, and retire across the Indus. There\r\nwere three European regiments, with powerful artillery, and the best\r\nnative troops locked up beyond the Indus. On the Ridge at Delhi they\r\nwould decide the issue of the siege. “If Delhi does not fall,” Lawrence\r\nargued, “Peshawur must go. Let us abandon the Punjaub for the sake of\r\nDelhi.”\r\n\r\nIt is still thrilling to read the sentences in which Herbert Edwardes\r\nprotested against this evil policy. To abandon Peshawur, he urged, would\r\nbe to fail not only at Delhi, but all over India. “Cabul would come\r\nagain!” Lawrence quoted Napoleon against Edwardes. Did not Napoleon\r\nruin himself in 1814 by holding fast to the line of the Elbe instead of\r\nfalling back to the Rhine? But Edwardes knew the Eastern mind. India is\r\nnot Europe. To waver, to seem to withdraw, to consent to disaster, was\r\nto be ruined. To abandon the Punjaub, Edwardes warned Lawrence, was to\r\nabandon the cause of England in the East. “Every hand in India would be\r\nagainst us. Don’t yield an inch of frontier!... If General Reed, with\r\nall the men you have sent him, cannot get into Delhi, let Delhi go. The\r\nEmpire’s reconquest hangs on the Punjaub.” Then he quotes Nelson against\r\nLawrence. “Make a stand! ‘Anchor, Hardy, anchor!’” The quotation was,\r\nperhaps, not very relevant; but it is curious to note how one brave\r\nspirit seems to speak to another across half a century, and give a new\r\nedge to its courage.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Edwardes showed, at this moment, not only\r\nthe more heroic temper, but the sounder judgment of the two. Canning\r\nsettled the dispute. “Hold on to Peshawur to the last,” he wrote; and\r\nthe question was decided. But Lawrence’s momentary lapse into indecision\r\nonly sets in more dazzling light his courage afterwards. It was after\r\nhe had seriously meditated abandoning the Punjaub that he despatched\r\nthe immortal movable column, under Nicholson, 4200 strong, with a\r\npowerful battering-train, to Delhi, thus feeding the gallant force on the\r\nRidge with his own best troops, and yet not giving up “an inch of the\r\nfrontier,” or abating one whit of his own haughty rule in the Punjaub!\r\n\r\nGeneral Anson, as we have seen, was commander-in-chief in India when\r\nthe Mutiny broke out. He was a brave man, had fought as an ensign at\r\nWaterloo, and had seen forty-three years’ bloodless service after that\r\ngreat battle. But his gifts were rather social than soldierly. He was a\r\nbetter authority on whist and horses than on questions of tactics and\r\nstrategy, and he was scarcely the man to face an army in revolt. Lawrence\r\nacted as a military brain and conscience for Anson, and determined that\r\nDelhi must be attacked; though, as a matter of fact, Anson had only\r\nthree regiments of British troops, almost no artillery, and absolutely no\r\ntransport at his command.\r\n\r\nOn May 16 Anson held a council of war with his five senior officers at\r\nUmballa, and the council agreed unanimously that, with the means at\r\nAnson’s command, nothing could be done. It is a curious fact, showing\r\nthe speed with which, from this point, events moved, that, within less\r\nthan two months from the date of that council, all its members were\r\ndead—either killed in battle, or killed by mere exposure and strain! But\r\nLawrence’s views prevailed. “Pray, only reflect on the whole history\r\nof India,” he wrote to Anson. “Where have we failed when we have acted\r\nvigorously? Where have we succeeded when guided by timid counsels?”\r\n\r\nAnson and his advisers gave that highest proof of courage which brave\r\nmen can offer: they moved forward without a murmur on an adventure which\r\nthey believed to be hopeless. From an orthodox military point of view it\r\nwas hopeless. Only, the British empire in India has been built up by the\r\ndoing of “hopeless” things.\r\n\r\nOn May 24 Anson reached Kurnal, where his troops were to arrive four days\r\nafterwards. On the 26th Anson himself was dead, killed by cholera after\r\nonly four hours’ illness!\r\n\r\nSir Henry Barnard, who succeeded him, had been Chief of the Staff in\r\nthe Crimea. He was an utter stranger to India, having landed in it only\r\na few weeks before. He was a brave soldier, and a high-minded English\r\ngentleman; but he was, perhaps, even less of a general than Anson. His\r\nforce consisted of 2400 infantry, 600 cavalry, and 22 field-guns. Barnard\r\nhad to fight one fierce and bloody combat before he reached the Delhi\r\nRidge. This took place on June 7. It was the first time the British and\r\nthe mutineers had met in the shock of battle; and the Sepoys who had\r\nrevolted at Meerut, and the British troops who had been so strangely\r\nheld back from crushing the revolt at the moment of its outbreak, now\r\nlooked grimly at each other across a narrow interval of sun-baked turf.\r\nLord Roberts says that when, as night fell on June 6, it was known that\r\nthe troops were to move forward and attack the rebel force which stood\r\nin their path to Delhi, the sick in hospital declared they would remain\r\nthere no longer, and “many quite unfit to walk insisted upon accompanying\r\nthe attacking column, imploring their comrades not to mention they were\r\nill, for fear they should not be allowed to take part in the fight!”\r\n\r\nThe rebels fought with an obstinacy unsurpassed in the whole record of\r\nthe Mutiny; but British troops in such a mood as we have described,\r\nwere not to be stayed. The 75th carried the rebel guns at the point of\r\nthe bayonet; Hope Grant with his scanty squadrons of horse swept round\r\ntheir left flank. The British lost less than 200 killed and wounded, the\r\nrebels lost over 1000 men and 13 guns; and, as night fell, Barnard took\r\npossession of the famous Ridge. Then from the streets of the revolted\r\ncity, the crowds looked up and saw the British flag, a gleaming and\r\nfluttering menace, a stern prophecy of defeat and retribution, flying\r\nfrom the Flagstaff Tower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DELHI 1857.\r\n\r\nWalker & Cockerell sc.]\r\n\r\nDelhi lies on the right bank of the Jumna; and nearly six miles of\r\nmassive stone wall twenty-four feet high, with a ditch twenty-five feet\r\nbroad and nearly as many feet deep in front, sweep round the city,\r\nforming a bow, of which the river is the string. Napier, afterwards\r\nLord Napier of Magdala, had employed his rare skill as an engineer in\r\nstrengthening the defences of the city. The walls were knotted with\r\nbastions, mounting 114 heavy guns. Behind them was a huge fanatical\r\npopulation and over 40,000 revolted Sepoys, with some 60 field-guns and\r\nexhaustless magazines of warlike supplies. Every week, from one revolted\r\nstation after another, new waves of mutineers flowed into the city. Some\r\n3000 British soldiers, with a few battalions of native troops, and 22\r\nlight guns, stood perched on the Ridge to undertake the desperate feat of\r\nbesieging this huge stronghold!\r\n\r\nThe historic Ridge, it may be explained, is a low hill, not quite sixty\r\nfeet high, and some two miles long, running obliquely towards the city\r\nwalls. Its left touches the Jumna itself, at a distance of more than\r\ntwo miles from the city; its right was within 1200 yards of the hostile\r\nwalls. At the middle of the Ridge stood the Flagstaff Tower. On its right\r\nextremity the Ridge overlooked the trunk road, and was surrounded by a\r\nfringe of houses and gardens, making it the weak point of the British\r\nposition. The various buildings along the crest of the Ridge, Hindu\r\nRao’s house, the observatory, an old Pathan mosque, the Flagstaff Tower,\r\n&c., were held by strong pickets, each with one or more field-guns.\r\nThe external slope of the Ridge was covered with old buildings and\r\nenclosures, giving the enemy dangerous shelter in their attacks. The main\r\nbody of the British was encamped on the reverse slope of the Ridge.\r\n\r\nDelhi, it will be seen, was in no sense “invested.” Supplies and\r\nreinforcements flowed in with perfect safety on its river front\r\nthroughout the whole siege. All that Barnard and his men could do was to\r\nkeep the British flag flying on the Ridge, and hold their ground with\r\nobstinate, unquenchable courage, against almost daily assaults, until\r\nreinforcements reached them, and they could leap on the city.\r\n\r\nThe first reinforcement to arrive took the surprising shape of a baby!\r\nOne officer alone, Tytler, of the 38th Native Infantry, had brought his\r\nwife into the camp; she was too ill to be sent to the rear, and, in a\r\nrough waggon for bed-chamber, gave birth to a son, who was solemnly named\r\n“Stanley Delhi Force.” The soldiers welcomed the infant with an odd\r\nmixture of humour and superstition. A British private was overheard to\r\nsay, “Now we shall get our reinforcements. This camp was formed to avenge\r\nthe blood of innocents, and the first reinforcement sent us is a new-born\r\ninfant!”\r\n\r\nThe next day the famous Guides sent by Lawrence from his Frontier Force\r\nmarched into camp, three troops of cavalry and six companies of infantry,\r\nunder Daly, an officer of great daring and energy. This little force had\r\nmarched 580 miles in twenty days, a feat of endurance unsurpassed in\r\nIndian history. The cavalry consisted mainly of Afghans, tall, swarthy,\r\nfierce-looking. The Ghoorkas were sturdy, undersized little Highlanders,\r\nborn fighters all of them, and ready to follow their commanding officer,\r\nMajor Reid, on any dare-devil feat to which he might lead them. The\r\nbattalion numbered 490 men, and of these no less than 320—or three out\r\nof four—were killed or wounded during the siege. On the day of the\r\nassault (September 14) no fewer than 180 of them, who were lying sick or\r\nwounded in the hospital, volunteered for the assault, and came limping\r\nand bandaged into the ranks of their comrades, to join in the mad rush\r\nthrough the Cashmere Gate!\r\n\r\nThe revolted Sepoys, on their side, were full of a fierce energy quite\r\nunusual to them, and on the very first day they flung themselves in great\r\nnumbers, and with great daring, on the detachment holding Hindu Rao’s\r\nhouse. Two companies of the 60th held this post, with two guns from\r\nScott’s battery; and for half the afternoon the quick flashes, the white\r\nsmoke of cannon, and the incessant rattle of musketry round the assailed\r\npost told with what fury the attack was being urged, and how stubbornly\r\nthe defence was being maintained.\r\n\r\nAt last the cavalry of the newly-arrived Guides was sent at the enemy.\r\nThey rode in upon the Sepoys with magnificent courage, broke them into\r\nflying fragments, and pursued them, wounding and slaying, to the walls\r\nof the city. Their victory was brilliant, but it was dearly bought,\r\ntheir commander, Quentin Battye, being mortally wounded. He was little\r\nmore than a lad, but was almost worshipped by his dark-faced horsemen.\r\nHe had been an English public-school boy, and, Lord Roberts says, was\r\ncuriously fond of quotations. Almost his last words, spoken to a friend,\r\nwere, “Good-bye! ‘Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.’ That’s how it\r\nis with me, old fellow!” The victories of England are still won, as in\r\nWellington’s days, on the playing grounds of its great schools.\r\n\r\nThe Guides found in the camp a soldier of mingled yet splendid fame who\r\nhad been their leader in many a gallant charge—Hodson, of Hodson’s Horse.\r\nHodson had been, rightly or wrongly, under a cloud; but the crisis of\r\nthe Mutiny naturally gave, to the most daring horseman and the most\r\nbrilliant light cavalry leader in India, a great opportunity. He was\r\nnow at the head of a body of irregular horse, and one of Barnard’s most\r\ntrusted officers. He was tall, fair-haired, with bloodless complexion,\r\nheavy curved moustache, and keen, alert, and what some one called\r\n“unforgiving” eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the Guides, as they rode into the camp, met Hodson, a curious\r\nscene took place. They crowded round him with wild gesticulations and\r\ndeep-voiced, guttural shouts. “They seized my bridle,” says Hodson\r\nhimself, “my dress, hands, and feet, and literally threw themselves\r\ndown before the horse with tears streaming down their faces!” Hodson\r\nwas the ideal leader for fierce irregulars like the Guides, a brilliant\r\nswordsman, of iron nerve, and courage as steadfast as the blade of his\r\nown sword. And with leaders like Daly, and Hodson, and Reid, and Battye,\r\nSikhs and Ghoorkas made soldiers that might have charged through Russian\r\nLife Guards, or broken a square of Pomeranian Grenadiers!\r\n\r\nOn June 10 the Sepoys delivered another attack, in great strength, on\r\nHindu Rao’s house, which they looked upon as the key of the British\r\nposition, and which was held on this day by the Ghoorkas under Reid. The\r\nSepoys hoped that the Ghoorkas would join them, and, as they came on,\r\ninstead of firing, they waved their hands, and shouted, “Don’t fire. We\r\nare not firing. We want to speak to you. Come and join us.” “Oh yes! we\r\nare coming,” answered the sturdy little Ghoorkas, with fierce, jesting\r\nhumour, and, running forward to within thirty yards of the Sepoys, they\r\npoured a quick and deadly fire upon them, driving them back with great\r\nslaughter. From that stage of the siege, Hindu Rao’s house, perhaps the\r\nmost fiercely attacked point in the British front, was held by Reid and\r\nhis Ghoorkas, and a better officer or better men were not to be found on\r\nthe Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe more eager spirits among the British were burning to leap on the\r\ncity, and, on June 12, a plan of attack was actually prepared by the\r\nengineer officers and Hodson, and approved by Barnard. The whole force\r\nwas to be divided into three columns; one was to break its way through\r\nthe Cashmere Gate, a second through the Lahore Gate, a third was to fling\r\nitself on the walls, and attempt an escalade—practically, the same plan\r\nby which the city was finally carried. It was a project, considering\r\nthe force available for its execution, almost insane in its daring; and\r\nBarnard, though he consented to it, took no decided and methodical steps\r\nto carry it out.\r\n\r\nIt would almost seem, indeed, as if physical strain, want of sleep, and\r\nthe terrible responsibility he was carrying, had affected Barnard’s head.\r\nThe situation might well have taxed—and over-taxed—the brain of a greater\r\ngeneral than Barnard. The light guns of the British, firing at a distance\r\nof a thousand yards, could make no impression on the walls. Their\r\nstrength was dwindling daily; that of the enemy was growing fast. And it\r\nwas natural that the British temper, under such conditions, should become\r\nexplosive, and that the more daring spirits were eager, in the face of\r\nany risks, to come to the sword’s point with their enemies. The General’s\r\nnerve was curiously shaken. Hope Grant tells how Sir Henry Barnard sent\r\nfor him on the evening of the 12th: “He hushed me into a whisper, and\r\nasked me if I thought any person could possibly overhear us, adding,\r\n‘There is treason around us.’ Then he explained, ‘I mean to attack the\r\ntown to-night.’” Barnard’s manner produced on Hope Grant’s mind the\r\nimpression that his brain was slightly off its balance.\r\n\r\nAt one o’clock that night the troops were suddenly paraded, ammunition\r\nserved out, and leaders assigned to the three columns. But the 75th Foot\r\nhad, somehow, been left at the extreme front without orders, and before\r\nthey could be brought up the grey dawn was breaking, and the proposed\r\nattack had to be abandoned. Lord Roberts says that this “blunder” was\r\n“a merciful dispensation, which saved the British from an irreparable\r\ndisaster.” That was not Hodson’s judgment. In his journal he says: “The\r\nattack was frustrated by the fears and absolute disobedience to orders\r\nof ⸺, the man who first lost Delhi, and has now, by his folly, prevented\r\nits being recaptured.” But Hodson was more impatient and blunt-spoken\r\nthan is permissible to even a gallant soldier, and his diary reflects,\r\nperhaps, rather the condition of his liver than the deliberate judgment\r\nof his head. Thus he writes: “That old woman ⸺, has come here for nothing\r\napparently, but as an obstacle; ⸺ is also a crying evil to us!”\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, indeed, the Sepoys themselves were attacking Flagstaff\r\nTower with great fury, but were repelled with steady valour. On June 14,\r\nGeneral Reed arrived in camp; he was in chief divisional command, and\r\nshould at once have taken over the charge of the siege from Barnard; but\r\na ride of 500 miles had left him little better than a physical wreck, and\r\nBarnard still remained in command.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, 14th, and 15th there were new attacks pluckily urged by\r\nthe Sepoys, and repelled with cool and stern courage by the British.\r\n“They came on,” is Hodson’s summary, “very boldly, and got most heartily\r\nthrashed.” On the 17th the British were attacked along their whole front,\r\nand from almost every direction, and an attempt was made to construct a\r\nbattery which would enfilade the Ridge. Two small columns, under Tombs\r\nand Reid, were sent out with a dash, broke up the proposed battery in\r\nbrilliant style, and drove the troops that covered it in wild and bloody\r\nflight to the city walls.\r\n\r\nWeek after week the fighting went on most gallantly, and the story gleams\r\nwith records of shining pluck; it rings with the clash of steel on steel;\r\nit thrills to the rattle of musketry volleys and the deeper voice of the\r\ncannon. Thus Hope Grant tells how, on the night of the 19th, from sunset\r\ntill half-past eleven, he kept back, by repeated charges of squadrons\r\nof the 9th Lancers and the Guides, with the help of some field-guns, an\r\nattack on the rear of the British position.\r\n\r\nThe fighting was close and furious. As Daly came up through the darkness\r\ninto the fight, Tombs said, “Daly, if you don’t charge, my guns are\r\ntaken;” and Daly, shaking his reins, and followed by a handful of his\r\nGuides, dashed on the enemy, and saved the guns. Colonel Yule, of the 9th\r\nLancers, was killed; Daly himself was severely wounded; and the enemy,\r\nin the dark, worked round the flanks of the British guns, and two of the\r\npieces were on the point of being taken.\r\n\r\nHope Grant collected a few men, and rode fiercely into the enemy’s ranks.\r\nHis horse was shot, and, galloping wildly into the mass of Sepoys, fell\r\ndead. Hope Grant was thus left unhorsed in the darkness, and in the midst\r\nof the enemy! His orderly, a fine, tall Sowar, who had remained loyal\r\nwhen his regiment mutinied, was in a moment by his side, and cried,\r\n“Take my horse; it is your only chance of safety.” Hope Grant refused\r\nthe generous offer, and, taking a firm grasp of the horse’s tail, bade\r\nthe Sowar drag him out of the _mêlée_. The next day Hope Grant sent for\r\nthe Sowar, warmly praised his gallant conduct, and offered him a reward\r\nin money. The brave fellow drew himself up with dignity, salaamed, and\r\nsaid, “No, Sahib, I will take no money.”\r\n\r\nSeaton describes how, during that wild night combat, they watched, from\r\nthe Ridge above, the flashes of the guns, rending the gloom with darting\r\npoints of flame, and listened to the shouts, the clash of weapons, the\r\ncrackle of the musketry that marked the progress of the fight. Presently\r\nthere came a sudden glare, then a roar that for a moment drowned all\r\nother sounds. One of the British limbers had blown up. The fight was\r\ngoing badly. Then, out of the darkness, came the cry of a human voice,\r\n“Where is the General?” It was an officer asking reinforcements, and\r\nthree companies of the 1st Fusileers, who were standing hard by, silent\r\nand invisible in the dusk, were sent down to the fight. They moved\r\nforward at the curt word of command: presently the rolling crash of their\r\nvolleys was heard; a line of red, dancing points of fire through the\r\ndarkness marked their progress, and the guns were saved!\r\n\r\nJune 23 was the centenary of Plassey, and a prediction, widely spread\r\namongst the Sepoys, announced that on that day the _raj_ of the British\r\nwas to end. As it happened, that particular day was also a great\r\nreligious festival for the Hindus, whilst it was the day of the new moon,\r\nand so was held by Mohammedans as a fortunate day. Accordingly an attack\r\nof great fury, and maintained for eight long hours, was made on the\r\nBritish right. Some reinforcements, amounting to 850 men, were on the\r\n22nd within twenty miles of Delhi, and a staff officer was despatched to\r\nhurry them on; and they actually reached the Ridge in time to take part\r\nin the final effort which drove back the enemy. Roberts says that “no men\r\ncould have fought better than did the Sepoys. They charged the Rifles,\r\nthe Guides, and the Ghoorkas again and again.” But nothing could shake\r\nthe cool and obstinate—the almost scornful—valour of the British.\r\n\r\nEvery available man in the camp was at the front, and when the 2nd\r\nFusileers and the 4th Sikhs, who formed the approaching reinforcement,\r\ncame pressing on with eager speed to the crest of the Ridge, over which\r\nthe battle-smoke was drifting in dense white clouds, they were at once\r\nsent into the fight, and the enemy was finally driven back with a loss of\r\nover 1600 men. It is not easy to picture the exhaustion of the British\r\nat the close of a fight so stern and prolonged. “When I arrived at Hindu\r\nRao’s,” wrote an eye-witness, “I found every one exhausted. There were\r\nthe 1st Fusileers and some Rifles all done up. I went on to the new\r\nadvanced battery; it was crowded with worn-out men. The artillerymen,\r\nlikewise done up, had ceased firing; another party of Rifles in a similar\r\nstate in another position. 120 men of the 2nd Fusileers, who had marched\r\ntwenty-three miles that morning and had had no breakfast, were lying\r\ndown exhausted. Three weak companies of Ghoorkas were out as skirmishers;\r\nbut they, too, were exhausted, and the remainder were resting under a\r\nrock. The heat was terrific, and the thermometer must have been at least\r\n140 degrees, with a hot wind blowing, and a frightful glare.” Of ten\r\nofficers in the 2nd Fusileers five were struck down by _coup de soleil_.\r\n\r\nThe next day Neville Chamberlain, Lawrence’s favourite officer, rode into\r\nthe camp, and assumed the post of adjutant-general.\r\n\r\nOn July 3 Baird Smith reached the Ridge, and took charge of the\r\nengineering operations of the siege. On July 5 Sir Henry Barnard died,\r\nkilled by the burden of a task too great for him, and Reed assumed\r\ncommand. He held it for less than ten days, and then passed it over to\r\nArchdale Wilson, who had shared in the discredit of Meerut, and who,\r\nthough a brave man, had scanty gifts of leadership.\r\n\r\nTwice over during those days of fierce and prolonged battle a time\r\nhad been fixed for assaulting the city, and twice the plan had been\r\nspoiled by an earlier counter-attack of the enemy. Baird Smith, on his\r\narrival, approved of the scheme for an assault, and urged it on Reed, who\r\nhesitated over it during the brief period of his command, and then handed\r\nit over as a perplexing legacy to his successor Wilson. The proposal to\r\nleap on Delhi was finally abandoned; but Baird Smith, the coolest brain\r\nemployed in the siege, recorded long afterwards his deliberate judgment\r\nthat “if we had assaulted any time between the 4th and 14th of July we\r\nshould have carried the place.”\r\n\r\nOn July 9, an attack of great strength, and marked by great daring, was\r\nmade by the enemy, and was almost lifted into success by the disloyalty\r\nof a detachment of the 9th Irregular Cavalry. They were on outpost duty,\r\nwatching the trunk road. They allowed the enemy to approach the British\r\nposition without giving warning, and when Hills, who commanded two guns\r\nin front of the General’s mound, ran out of his tent and leaped on his\r\nhorse, he found a troop of Carabineers in broken flight, sweeping past\r\nhim, and the enemy almost on his guns. He shouted “Action front!” then,\r\nto give his gunners a chance of firing, rode single-handed into the\r\nenemy’s squadrons, a solitary swordsman charging a regiment!\r\n\r\nHills actually cut down the leading man, and wounded the second; then\r\ntwo troopers charging him at once, he was rolled over, man and horse,\r\nand the troops swept over him. Hills struggled, bruised and half-dazed,\r\nto his feet, picked up his sword, and was at once attacked by two of the\r\nrebel cavalry and a foot soldier. Hills coolly shot the first horseman\r\nriding down upon him, then catching the lance of the second in his left\r\nhand, thrust him through the body with his sword. He was instantly\r\nattacked by the third enemy, and his sword wrenched from him. Hills, on\r\nthis, fell back upon first principles, and struck his opponent in the\r\nface repeatedly with his fist. But he was by this time himself exhausted,\r\nand fell. Then, exactly as his antagonist lifted his sword to slay him,\r\nTombs, who had cut his way through the enemy, and was coming up at a\r\ngallop to help his comrade, with a clever pistol-shot from a distance of\r\nthirty paces killed the Sepoy. It was a Homeric combat, and both Tombs\r\nand Hills received the Victoria Cross.\r\n\r\nThe enemy meanwhile had galloped past the guns, eager to reach the native\r\nartillery, which they hoped would ride off with them. The 9th Lancers,\r\nhowever, had turned out in their shirt-sleeves, and they, riding fiercely\r\nhome, drove off the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is always interesting to listen to the story of a gallant deed, as\r\ntold by the doer himself. The reckless valour which Lieutenant Hills\r\nshowed in charging, single-handed, a column of rebel cavalry, in order to\r\nsecure for his gunners a chance of opening fire, can hardly be described\r\nby a remote historian. But Hills has told the story of his own deed, and\r\nan extract from his tale, at least, is worth giving:—\r\n\r\n    I thought that by charging them I might make a commotion, and\r\n    give the gun time to load, so in I went at the front rank,\r\n    cut down the first fellow, slashed the next across the face\r\n    as hard as I could, when two Sowars charged me. Both their\r\n    horses crashed into mine at the same moment, and, of course,\r\n    both horse and myself were sent flying. We went down at such a\r\n    pace that I escaped the cuts made at me, one of them giving my\r\n    jacket an awful slice just below the left arm—it only, however,\r\n    cut the jacket. Well, I lay quite snug until all had passed\r\n    over me, and then got up and looked about for my sword. I found\r\n    it full ten yards off. I had hardly got hold of it when three\r\n    fellows returned, two on horseback. The first I wounded, and\r\n    dropped him from his horse. The second charged me with a lance.\r\n    I put it aside, and caught him an awful gash on the head and\r\n    face. I thought I had killed him. Apparently he must have clung\r\n    to his horse, for he disappeared. The wounded man then came up,\r\n    but got his skull split. Then came on the third man—a young,\r\n    active fellow. I found myself getting very weak from want of\r\n    breath, the fall from my horse having pumped me considerably,\r\n    and my cloak, somehow or other, had got tightly fixed round my\r\n    throat, and was actually choking me. I went, however, at the\r\n    fellow and cut him on the shoulder, but some “kupra” (cloth)\r\n    on it apparently turned the blow. He managed to seize the hilt\r\n    of my sword, and twisted it out of my hand, and then we had a\r\n    hand-to-hand fight, I punching his head with my fists, and he\r\n    trying to cut me, but I was too close to him. Somehow or other\r\n    I fell, and then was the time, fortunately for me, that Tombs\r\n    came up and shot the fellow. I was so choked by my cloak that\r\n    move I could not until I got it loosened. By-the-bye, I forgot\r\n    to say that I fired at this chap twice, but the pistol snapped,\r\n    and I was so enraged I drove it at the fellow’s head, missing\r\n    him, however.\r\n\r\nThe Sepoys had planted a battery of guns at a point in their front called\r\nLudlow Castle, and maintained from it a constant fire on Metcalfe House.\r\nTheir skirmishers, too, crept up with great audacity, and maintained a\r\nceaseless fire on the British pickets. It was necessary to silence this\r\nbattery, and early in the morning of August 12, without call of bugle or\r\nroll of drum, a force of British, Sikhs, and Ghoorkas, with a handful\r\nof cavalry, stole down the slope of the Ridge in order to carry the\r\noffending guns. The order was given for profoundest silence, and almost\r\nlike a procession of shadows the little column crept over the Ridge\r\nthrough the gloom, and disappeared in the midst of the low-lying ground\r\non its way to the rebel guns.\r\n\r\nUndetected in the sheltering blackness, the column reached the sleeping\r\nbattery. A startled Sepoy, who caught through the haze and shadow a\r\nsudden glimpse of stern faces and the gleam of bayonets, gave a hasty\r\nchallenge. It was answered by a volley which ran like a streak of jagged\r\nflame through the darkness, and with a rush the British—their officers\r\ngallantly leading, and Sikh and Ghoorka trying to outrace their English\r\ncomrades—swept on to the battery. The Sepoys succeeded in discharging two\r\nguns on their assailants; but Lord Roberts records that the discharge of\r\nthe third gun was prevented by a gallant Irish soldier named Reegan.\r\nHe leaped with levelled bayonet over the earthwork, and charged the\r\nartilleryman, who was in the very act of thrusting his port-fire on to\r\nthe powder in the touch-hole of the gun. Reegan was struck at on every\r\nside, but nothing stopped him, and the fierce lunge of his bayonet\r\nslew the artilleryman and prevented the discharge of the gun. Captain\r\nGreville, followed by two or three men, flung himself on another gun, and\r\nslew or drove off its gunners.\r\n\r\nHodson characteristically says, “It was a very comfortable little\r\naffair!” As a matter of fact, it was, for a dozen fierce minutes, a\r\ndeadly hand-to-hand combat. “The rebel artillerymen,” says Roberts,\r\n“stood to their guns splendidly, and fought till they were all killed.”\r\nThe rebels, too, were in great force, and as the passionate _mêlée_\r\nswayed to and fro, and the muskets crackled fiercely, and angry thrust\r\nof bayonet was answered by desperate stroke of tulwar, the slaughter\r\nwas great. Some 250 Sepoys were slain, while the British only lost one\r\nofficer and nineteen men, though nearly a hundred more were wounded. But\r\nthe battery was destroyed, and four guns brought back in triumph to the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nThe return of the force was a scene of mad excitement. A wounded\r\nofficer sat astride one gun, waving his hand in triumph. A soldier,\r\nwith musket and bayonet fixed, bestrode each horse, and dozens of\r\nshouting infantrymen—many with wounds and torn uniform, and all with\r\nsmoke-blackened faces—clung, madly cheering, to the captured pieces.\r\n\r\nOn August 7 there rode into the British camp perhaps the most famous\r\nand daring soldier in all India, the man with whose memory the siege\r\nof Delhi, and the great assault which ended the siege, are for ever\r\nassociated—John Nicholson.\r\n\r\nNicholson was of Irish birth, the son of a Dublin physician, who had\r\nseen twenty years’ service in India—service brilliant and varied beyond\r\neven what is common in that field of great deeds. There is no space\r\nhere to tell the story of Nicholson’s career, but as he rode into the\r\nBritish camp that August morning, he was beyond all question the most\r\npicturesque and striking figure in India. He was a man of splendid\r\nphysique, and is said to have borne an almost bewildering resemblance to\r\nthe Czar Nicholas. He was six feet two in height, strongly built, with\r\na flowing dark-coloured beard, colourless face, grey eyes, with dark\r\npupils, in whose depths, when he was aroused, a point of steady light, as\r\nof steel or of flame, would kindle. Few men, indeed, could sustain the\r\npiercing look of those lustrous, menacing eyes. His voice had a curious\r\ndepth in it; his whole bearing a singular air of command and strength—an\r\nimpression which his habit of rare and curt speech intensified. “He was\r\na man,” says one who knew him well, “cast in a giant mould, with massive\r\nchest and powerful limbs, and an expression, ardent and commanding, with\r\na dash of roughness; features of stern beauty, a long black beard, and\r\nsonorous voice. His imperial air never left him.” “Nicholson,” says\r\nLord Roberts, “impressed me more profoundly than any man I had ever met\r\nbefore, or have ever met since.”\r\n\r\nNicholson, like the Lawrences, like Havelock, and Herbert Edwardes, and\r\nmany of the Indian heroes of that generation, was a man of rough but\r\nsincere piety, and this did not weaken his soldiership—it rather gave\r\na new loftiness to its ideals and a steadier pulse to its courage. “If\r\nthere is a desperate deed to be done in India,” Herbert Edwardes told\r\nLord Canning, “John Nicholson is the man to do it”; and exactly that\r\nimpression and conviction Nicholson kindled in everybody about him.\r\n\r\n“He had,” says Mrs. Steel, “the great gift. He could put his own heart\r\ninto a whole camp, and make it believe it was its own.” Such a masterful\r\nwill and personality as that of Nicholson took absolutely captive the\r\nimagination of the wild, irregular soldiery of which he was the leader.\r\n\r\nWhat was Nicholson’s fighting quality, indeed, may be judged, say,\r\nfrom the fashion in which he smashed up the mutinous Sepoys at Mardan\r\n(as told in Trotter’s “Life” of him), and chased them mile after mile\r\ntowards the hills of Swat, Nicholson leading the pursuit on his huge grey\r\ncharger, “his great sword felling a Sepoy at every stroke!” His faculty\r\nfor strategy, and for swift, sustained movement is, again, told by the\r\nmanner in which he intercepted and destroyed the Sealkote mutineers at\r\nthe fords of the Ravi on their way to Delhi, The mutineers were two days’\r\nmarch ahead of him, and Nicholson made a forced march of forty-four miles\r\nin a single day, and under a July sun in India, to get within stroke of\r\nthem. Nicholson’s little force started at 9 P.M. on July 10, and marched\r\ntwenty-six miles without a break; after a halt of two hours they started\r\non their second stage of eighteen miles at 10 A.M. During the hottest\r\nhour of the afternoon the force camped in a grove of trees, and the men\r\nfell, exhausted, into instant slumber.\r\n\r\nPresently an officer, awakening, looked round for his general. “He saw\r\nNicholson,” says Trotter, “in the middle of the hot, dusty road, sitting\r\nbolt upright on his horse in the full glare of that July sun, waiting\r\nlike a sentinel turned to stone for the moment when his men should resume\r\ntheir march!” They might take shelter from the heat, but he scorned it.\r\nA march so swift and fierce was followed by an attack equally vehement,\r\nNicholson leading the rush on the enemy’s guns in person, and with his\r\nown sword cutting literally in two a rebel gunner in the very act of\r\nputting his linstock to the touch-hole of his cannon.\r\n\r\nThe worship of force is natural to the Eastern mind; and, in 1848, when\r\nNicholson was scouring the country between the Attock and the Jhelum,\r\nmaking incredible marches, and shattering with almost incredible valour\r\nwhole armies with a mere handful of troops, the mingled admiration and\r\ndread of the native mind rose to the pieties of a religion. “To this\r\nday,” a border chief told Younghusband, twelve years after Nicholson\r\nwas dead, “our women at night wake trembling, and saying they hear the\r\ntramp of Nikalsain’s war-horse!” A brotherhood of Fakirs renounced all\r\nother creeds, and devoted themselves to the worship of “Nikkul-Seyn.”\r\nThey would lie in wait for Nicholson, and fall at his feet with votive\r\nofferings.\r\n\r\nNicholson tried to cure their inconvenient piety by a vigorous\r\napplication of the whip, and flogged them soundly on every opportunity.\r\nBut this, to the Fakir mind, supplied only another proof of the great\r\nIrishman’s divinity; and, to quote Herbert Edwardes, “the sect of\r\nNikkul-Seynees remained as devoted as ever. _Sanguis martyrum est semen\r\nEcclesiæ!_ On one occasion, after a satisfactory whipping, Nicholson\r\nreleased his devotees on the condition that they would transfer their\r\nadoration to John Becher; but as soon as they attained their freedom they\r\nresumed their worship of the relentless Nikkul-Seyn.” The last of the\r\nsect, says Raikes, dug his own grave, and was found dead in it shortly\r\nafter the news came that Nicholson had fallen at Delhi.\r\n\r\nNicholson’s ardour had made him outride the movable column he was\r\nbringing up to reinforce the besiegers; but on August 14, with drums\r\nbeating and flags flying, and welcomed with cheers by the whole camp,\r\nthat gallant little force marched in. It consisted of the 52nd, 680\r\nstrong, a wing of the 61st, the second Punjaub Infantry, with some\r\nBeloochees and military police, and a field battery.\r\n\r\nWork for such a force, and under such a leader, was quickly found. The\r\nsiege train intended to breach the walls of Delhi was slowly creeping\r\nalong the road from the Punjaub, and with unusual daring a great force of\r\nmutineers marched from Delhi to intercept this convoy. The movement was\r\ndetected, and on August 25 Nicholson, with 1600 infantry, 400 cavalry,\r\nand a battery of field guns, set out to cut off the Sepoy force.\r\n\r\nThe rain fell in ceaseless, wind-blown sheets, as only Indian rain can\r\nfall. The country to be crossed was mottled with swamps. The roads were\r\nmere threads of liquid mud, and the march was of incredible difficulty.\r\nThe enemy was overtaken at Nujutgurh, after a sort of wading march which\r\nlasted twelve hours. “No other man in India,” wrote a good soldier\r\nafterwards, “would have taken that column to Nujutgurh. An artillery\r\nofficer told me that at one time the water was over his horses’ backs,\r\nand he thought they could not possibly get out of their difficulties. But\r\nhe looked ahead, and saw Nicholson’s great form riding steadily on as if\r\nnothing was the matter.”\r\n\r\nThe rebels, 6000 strong, held an almost unassailable position, edged\r\nround with swamps and crossed in front by a deep and swift stream with\r\nan unknown ford. In the dusk, however, Nicholson led his troops across\r\nthe stream. As they came splashing up from its waters he halted them,\r\nand, with his deep, far-reaching voice, told them to withhold their fire\r\ntill within thirty yards of the enemy. He then led them steadily on, at a\r\nfoot-pace, over a low hill, and through yet another swamp, while the fire\r\nof the enemy grew ever fiercer.\r\n\r\nWhen within twenty yards of the enemy’s guns, Nicholson gave the word to\r\ncharge. A swift volley, and an almost swifter rush, followed. The British\r\nin a moment were over the enemy’s guns, Nicholson still leading, his\r\ngleaming sword, as it rose and fell in desperate strokes, by this time\r\nturned bloody red. Gabbett, of the 61st, ran straight at one of the guns,\r\nand his men, though eagerly following, could not keep pace with their\r\nlight-footed officer. He had just reached the gun, fully twenty paces in\r\nadvance of his men, when his foot slipped, he fell, and was instantly\r\nbayoneted by a gigantic Sepoy. With a furious shout—a blast of wrathful\r\npassion—his panting men came up, carried the gun, and bayoneted the\r\ngunners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL JOHN NICHOLSON\r\n\r\n_From a portrait in the East India United Service Club_]\r\n\r\nNicholson had the true genius of a commander. The moment he had carried\r\nthe guns he swung to the left; and led his men in a rush for a bridge\r\nacross the canal in the enemy’s rear, which formed their only line of\r\nretreat to Delhi. An Indian force is always peculiarly sensitive to a\r\nstroke at its line of retreat, and the moment Nicholson’s strategy was\r\nunderstood the Sepoy army resolved itself into a flying mob, eager only\r\nto outrun the British in the race for the bridge. Nicholson captured\r\nthirteen guns, killed or wounded 800 of the enemy, and drove the rest,\r\na mob of terrified fugitives, to Delhi, his own casualties amounting to\r\nsixty.\r\n\r\nHis men had outmarched their supplies, and they had at once to retrace\r\ntheir steps to Delhi. They had marched thirty-five miles, under furious\r\nrains and across muddy roads, and had beaten a force three times stronger\r\nthan their own, holding an almost impregnable position, and had done it\r\nall in less than forty hours, during twenty-four of which they had been\r\nwithout food. It was a great feat, and as the footsore, mud-splashed\r\nsoldiers came limping into the camp all the regimental bands on the Ridge\r\nturned out to play them in.\r\n\r\nThe few hours preceding Nicholson’s arrival at the Ridge were the\r\ndarkest hours of the siege, and some at least of the British leaders\r\nwere hesitating whether the attempt to carry the city ought not to be\r\nabandoned. The circumstances, indeed, were such as might well strain\r\nhuman fortitude to the breaking point. The British force of all arms,\r\nnative and European, was under 6000. Its scanty and light artillery\r\ncommanded only two out of the seven gates of Delhi. The siege, in fact,\r\nwas, as one writer puts it, “a struggle between a mere handful of men\r\non an open ridge and a host behind massive and well-fortified walls.”\r\nCholera was raging among the British. The 52nd on August 14 marched into\r\ncamp 680 strong with only six sick. On September 14—only four weeks\r\nlater, that is—the effectives of the regiment were only 240 of all ranks.\r\nNearly two men out of every three had gone down!\r\n\r\nThere was treachery, too, in Wilson’s scanty force. Their plans were\r\nbetrayed to the enemy. The slaughter amongst the British officers in the\r\nnative regiments was such as could only be explained by the fact that\r\nthey were shot down by their own men from behind, rather than by their\r\nopen foes in the front. The one good service General Reed did during his\r\nbrief interval of command was to dismiss from the camp some suspected\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nArchdale Wilson’s nerve, like that of Barnard and of Reed, his\r\npredecessors, was shaken by the terrific strain of the siege, and he\r\ncontemplated abandoning it. “Wilson’s head is going,” wrote Nicholson to\r\nLawrence on September 7; “he says so himself, and it is quite evident\r\nhe speaks the truth.” It was due chiefly to John Lawrence’s clear\r\njudgment and iron strength of will that a step so evil and perilous was\r\nnot taken. Lawrence had flung his last coin, his last cartridge, his\r\nlast man into the siege, and he warned Wilson that the whole fate of\r\nthe British in India depended on an immediate assault. “Every day,” he\r\nwrote, “disaffection and mutiny spread. Every day adds to the danger of\r\nthe native princes taking part against us.” The loyalty of the Sikhs\r\nthemselves was strained to the breaking point. Had the British flag\r\nfallen back from the Ridge, not merely would Delhi have poured out its\r\narmed host, 50,000 strong, but every village in the north-west would have\r\nrisen, and the tragedy of the Khyber Pass might have been repeated, on a\r\nvaster scale, upon the plains of Hindustan. The banks of the Jumna might\r\nhave seen such a spectacle as Cabul once witnessed.\r\n\r\nBut there were brave men on the Ridge itself, trained in Lawrence’s\r\nschool, and in whom the spirit of John Lawrence burned with clear and\r\nsteady flame. Baird Smith and Neville Chamberlain, Norman and Nicholson,\r\nand many another, knew that the fortunes and honour of England hung on\r\nthe capture of Delhi. Lord Roberts tells a curious and wild story that\r\nshows what was Nicholson’s temper at this crisis:—\r\n\r\n    I was sitting in Nicholson’s tent before he set out to attend\r\n    the council. He had been talking to me in confidential terms\r\n    of personal matters, and ended by telling me of his intention\r\n    to take a very unusual step should the council fail to arrive\r\n    at any fixed determination regarding the assault. “Delhi\r\n    must be taken,” he said, “and it is absolutely essential\r\n    that this should be done at once; and, if Wilson hesitates\r\n    longer, I intend to propose at to-day’s meeting that he\r\n    should be superseded.” I was greatly startled, and ventured\r\n    to remark that, as Chamberlain was _hors de combat_ from his\r\n    wound, Wilson’s removal would leave him (Nicholson) senior\r\n    officer with the force. He smiled as he answered, “I have\r\n    not overlooked that fact. I shall make it perfectly clear\r\n    that, under the circumstances, I could not possibly accept\r\n    the command myself, and I shall propose that it be given to\r\n    Campbell of the 52nd. I am prepared to serve under him for the\r\n    time being, so no one can ever accuse me of being influenced by\r\n    personal motives.”\r\n\r\nRoberts puts on record his “confident belief” that Nicholson would have\r\ncarried out this daring scheme, and he adds that, in his deliberate\r\njudgment, Nicholson was right. Discipline in a crisis so stern counts for\r\nless than the public honour and the national safety.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that on a still earlier date, September 11—Nicholson\r\nhad written to Lawrence telling him Wilson was talking of withdrawing\r\nthe guns and giving up the siege. “Had Wilson carried out his threat of\r\nwithdrawing the guns,” adds Nicholson, “I was quite prepared to appeal\r\nto the army to set him aside, and elect a successor. I have seen lots of\r\nuseless generals in my day; but such an ignorant, croaking obstructive as\r\nhe is, I have never hitherto met with!”\r\n\r\nFortunately, Wilson found a tonic in the spirit of the men who sat round\r\nhis council-table. “The force,” he wrote to the Chief Commissioner, “will\r\ndie at their post.” Reinforcements came creeping in, till the forces\r\non the Ridge rose to 8748 men, of whom, however, less than half were\r\nBritish. The battering-train from Umballa, too, safely reached the camp.\r\nIt consisted of six 24-pounders, eight 18-pounders, and four 8-inch\r\nhowitzers, with 1000 rounds of ammunition per piece. The huge convoy,\r\nwith its tumbrils and ammunition-carts, sprawled over thirteen miles of\r\nroad, and formed an amazing evidence of the energy and resources of John\r\nLawrence.\r\n\r\nNow at last the siege really began. Ground was broken for the new\r\nbatteries on September 7, at a distance of 700 yards from the walls,\r\nand each battery, as it was armed, broke into wrathful thunder on the\r\ncity. Each succeeding battery, too, was pushed up closer to the enemy’s\r\ndefences. Thus Major Scott’s battery was pushed up to within 180 yards of\r\nthe wall, and the heavy guns to arm it had to be dragged up under angry\r\nblasts of musketry fire. No fewer than thirty-nine men in this single\r\nbattery were struck down during the first night of its construction! A\r\nsection of No. 1 Battery took fire under the constant flash of its own\r\nguns, and, as the dancing flames rose up from it, the enemy turned on the\r\nburning spot every gun that could be brought to bear. The only way to\r\nquench the fire was to take sand-bags to the top of the battery, cut them\r\nopen, and smother the fire with streams of sand.\r\n\r\nA Ghoorka officer named Lockhart called for volunteers, and leaped upon\r\nthe top of the battery, exposed, without shelter, to a storm of cannon\r\nballs and musket bullets. Half-a-dozen Ghoorkas instantly followed him.\r\nFour out of the seven men—including Lockhart himself—were shot down, but\r\nthe fire was quenched.\r\n\r\nThe fire of the batteries was maintained with amazing energy and daring\r\nuntil September 13. Colonel Brind, for example, records that he never\r\ntook off his clothes or left his guns from the moment they opened on the\r\n8th to the 14th inst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDELHI: THE LEAP ON THE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 13 four engineer officers—Medley and Lang, Greathed and\r\nHome—undertook the perilous task of examining the breaches in the enemy’s\r\ndefences. Medley and Lang were detailed to examine the Cashmere Bastion,\r\nand Lang asked to be allowed to go while it was yet daylight. Leave was\r\ngranted; and, with an escort of four men of the 60th, he crept to the\r\nedge of the cover on the British front, then coolly ran up the glacis and\r\nsat down upon the top of the counterscarp, under a heavy fire, studying\r\nthe ditch and the two breaches beyond, and returned unhurt, to pronounce\r\nthe breach practicable! It was necessary, however, to ascertain the depth\r\nof the ditch, and Lang and Medley were sent again, after nightfall, on\r\nthis business.\r\n\r\nMedley himself may tell the story of the daring adventure:—\r\n\r\n    It was a bright, starlight night, with no moon, and the roar\r\n    of the batteries, and clear, abrupt reports of the shells\r\n    from the mortars, alone broke the stillness of the scene;\r\n    while the flashes of the rockets, carcasses, and fireballs\r\n    lighting up the air ever and anon made a really beautiful\r\n    spectacle. The ghurees struck ten, and, as preconcerted,\r\n    the fire of the batteries suddenly ceased. Our party was in\r\n    readiness. We drew swords, felt that our revolvers were ready\r\n    to hand, and, leaving the shelter of the picquet, such as it\r\n    was, advanced stealthily into the enemy’s country.... With\r\n    the six men who were to accompany us, Lang and I emerged into\r\n    the open, and pushed straight for the breach. In five minutes\r\n    we found ourselves on the edge of the ditch, the dark mass of\r\n    the Cashmere Bastion immediately on the other side, and the\r\n    breach distinctly discernible. Not a soul was in sight. The\r\n    counterscarp was sixteen feet deep, and steep. Lang slid down\r\n    first, I passed down the ladder, and, taking two men out of the\r\n    six, descended after him, leaving the other four on the cope to\r\n    cover our retreat.\r\n\r\n    Two minutes more and we should have been at the top of\r\n    the breach. But, quiet as we had been, the enemy were on\r\n    the watch, and we heard several men running from the left\r\n    towards the breach. We therefore reascended, though with\r\n    some difficulty, and, throwing ourselves down on the grass,\r\n    waited in silence for what was to happen. A number of figures\r\n    immediately appeared on the top of the breach, their forms\r\n    clearly discernible against the bright sky, and not twenty\r\n    yards distant. We, however, were in the deep shade, and they\r\n    could not, apparently, see us. They conversed in a low tone,\r\n    and presently we heard the ring of their steel ramrods as they\r\n    loaded. We waited quietly, hoping that they would go away, when\r\n    another attempt might be made. Meanwhile, we could see that the\r\n    breach was a good one, the slope being easy of ascent, and that\r\n    there were no guns on the flank. We knew by experience, too,\r\n    that the ditch was easy of descent. After waiting, therefore,\r\n    some minutes longer, I gave the signal. The whole of us jumped\r\n    up at once and ran back towards our own ground. Directly we\r\n    were discovered a volley was sent after us. The balls came\r\n    whizzing about our ears, but no one was touched.\r\n\r\nThe other engineers performed their task with equal coolness and daring,\r\nand at midnight all the breaches were reported practicable, and it was\r\nresolved that the assault should be made in the morning.\r\n\r\nNicholson, at the head of a column of 1000 men—of whom 300 belonged to\r\nthe 75th—was to carry the breach near the Cashmere Bastion. The second\r\ncolumn, under Brigadier Jones, composed of the 8th, the 2nd Bengal\r\nFusileers, and the 4th Sikhs—850 in all—was to assail the gap near the\r\nWater Bastion. The third column, 950 strong, under Campbell, of the\r\n52nd, was to blow in the Cashmere Gate and fight its way into the city.\r\nThe fourth column, under Major Reid, made up of the Guides’ Infantry,\r\nGhoorkas, and men from the picquets, was to break in an entrance by the\r\nLahore Gate. A reserve column, 1000 strong, under Brigadier Longfield,\r\nof the 8th, was to feed the attack at any point where help was required.\r\nFive thousand men were thus to fling themselves on a great city held by\r\n50,000!\r\n\r\nIt was three o’clock in the morning, the stars still burning in the\r\nmeasureless depths of the Indian sky, when the columns stood in grim\r\nsilence ready for the assault. The chaplain of the forces records that\r\nin not a few of the tents the service for the day was read before the\r\nmen went out into the darkness to join the columns. The lesson for the\r\nday, as it happened, was Nahum iii., and the opening verse runs, “Woe to\r\nthe bloody city! It is full of lies and robbery.... Behold, I am against\r\nthee, saith the Lord of Hosts.”\r\n\r\nHow do men feel who gather at such an hour and for such a deed? Lord\r\nRoberts quotes from a brother officer’s diary a curious little picture of\r\nBritish soldiers preparing themselves for one of the most daring exploits\r\nin the history of war:—\r\n\r\n    We each of us looked carefully to the reloading of our pistols,\r\n    filling of flasks and getting as good protection as possible\r\n    for our heads, which would be exposed so much going up the\r\n    ladders. I wound two puggaries or turbans round my old forage\r\n    cap, with the last letter from the hills in the top, and\r\n    committed myself to the care of Providence. There was not much\r\n    sleep that night in our camp. I dropped off now and then, but\r\n    never for long, and whenever I woke I could see that there was\r\n    a light in more than one of the officers’ tents, and talking\r\n    was going on in a low tone amongst the men, the snapping of a\r\n    lock or the springing of a ramrod sounding far in the still\r\n    air, telling of preparation for the coming strife. A little\r\n    after midnight we fell in as quickly as possible, and by the\r\n    light of a lantern the orders for the assault were then read\r\n    to the men. Any officer or man who might be wounded was to\r\n    be left where he fell; no one was to step from the ranks to\r\n    help him, as there were no men to spare. If the assault were\r\n    successful he would be taken away in the doolies, or litters,\r\n    and carried to the rear, or wherever he could best receive\r\n    medical assistance. If we failed, wounded and sound should be\r\n    prepared to bear the worst. No prisoners were to be made, as\r\n    we had no one to guard them, and care was to be taken that no\r\n    women or children were injured. To this the men answered at\r\n    once by “No fear, sir.” The officers now pledged their honour,\r\n    on their swords, to abide by these orders, and the men then\r\n    promised to follow their example.\r\n\r\n    At this moment, just as the regiment was about to march off,\r\n    Father Bertrand came up in his vestments, and, addressing the\r\n    Colonel, begged for permission to bless the regiment, saying,\r\n    “We may differ, some of us, in matters of religion, but the\r\n    blessing of an old man and a clergyman can do nothing but\r\n    good.” The colonel at once assented, and Father Bertrand,\r\n    lifting his hands to heaven, blessed the regiment in a most\r\n    impressive manner, offering up at the same time a prayer for\r\n    our success, and for mercy on the souls of those soon to die.\r\n\r\nThe dash on the city was to have taken place at three o’clock in the\r\nmorning, but it was difficult to collect all the men from the picquets\r\nwho were to take part in the assault, and day was breaking before the\r\ncolumns were complete. The engineers, closely examining the breaches,\r\nfound that during the night the Sepoys had blocked up the gaps with\r\nsand-bags and had improvised _chevaux de frise_. The attack was\r\naccordingly held back for a few minutes while the British batteries\r\nre-opened for the purpose of smashing the new defences.\r\n\r\nThe sun was clear of the horizon when, at a signal, the batteries ceased.\r\nA sudden silence fell on the slope of the Ridge and on the enemy’s wall.\r\nA thrill ran through the waiting columns, as each man, like a hound\r\non the leash, braced himself up for the desperate rush. Nicholson had\r\nbeen standing, silent and alone, in front of his column; and now with a\r\ngesture of his hand he gave the signal. A shout, sudden, and stern, and\r\nfierce, broke through the air. It came from the 60th Rifles, who with a\r\nvehement cheer ran out to the front in skirmishing order, and in a moment\r\nthe four columns were in swift and orderly movement. Then the enemy’s\r\nguns from every point broke into flame!\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to compress into a few paragraphs of cold type the story\r\nof that great assault; the fire and passion of the charge, the stubborn\r\nfury of the defence, the long, mad struggle through the streets. And the\r\nfact that four desperate combats at as many separate points broke out at\r\nonce makes it still more difficult to give any single connected picture\r\nof the scene.\r\n\r\nNicholson led column No. 1 steadily forward till it reached the edge of\r\nthe jungle. Then the engineers and storming party went forward at a run.\r\nThey reached the crest of the glacis, and stood there under a perfect\r\nblaze of musketry. The stormers had outrun the ladder parties! The ditch\r\ngaped sixteen feet wide below them. The breach in front was crowded\r\nwith dark figures, shouting, firing, hurling stones, all in a tempest\r\nof Eastern fury. The ladders were quickly up, and were dropped into the\r\nditch. The men leaped down, and almost with the same impulse swept up\r\nthe further side—Nicholson’s tall figure leading—and men and officers,\r\ncontending madly with each other who should be first, raced up the broken\r\nslope of the breach, dashed the Sepoys back in confused flight, and\r\ngained the city!\r\n\r\nThe second column was as gallantly led as the first, and met with an\r\nalmost fiercer resistance. At the signal its storming party ran out from\r\nthe shelter of the Customs house. The two engineer officers, Greathed and\r\nOvenden, and twenty-nine men out of the thirty-nine who formed the ladder\r\nparties were instantly shot down; but the attack never paused for an\r\ninstant. The men of the 8th, the Sikhs, and the Fusileers came on with a\r\nsilent speed and fury that nothing could stop. The ditch was crossed, as\r\nwith a single effort. One officer—little more than a lad—Ensign Phillips,\r\nwith soldierly quickness, and with the help of a few riflemen, swung\r\nround the guns on the Water Bastion, and opened fire with them on the\r\nSepoys themselves.\r\n\r\nThe assault of the third column, directed at the Cashmere Gate, is,\r\nperhaps, the most picturesque and well-known incident in the wild story\r\nof that morning. This column did not find a breach; one had to be made!\r\nCampbell brought up his column within sight of the Cashmere Gate, but\r\nunder cover; then, at the signal, a little cluster of soldiers ran out\r\ntowards the gate. Its first section consisted of Home, of the Engineers,\r\nwith two sergeants and ten sappers, each man carrying a bag containing\r\ntwenty-five pounds of gunpowder. Behind them ran a firing party of the\r\n52nd, under Salkeld. The sight of that little, daring handful of men,\r\ncharging straight for the gate, so amazed the Sepoys that for a few\r\nmoments they stared at them without firing. Then, from the wall on either\r\nside of the gate, from above the gate itself, and from an open wicket in\r\nits broad expanse, broke a sustained and angry blaze of musketry!\r\n\r\nTo run steadily on in the teeth of such a fire was a feat of amazing\r\ncourage. But, Home leading, the little cluster of heroes never faltered.\r\nThe bridge in front of the gate had been almost completely destroyed, a\r\nsingle beam being stretched across the ditch; and, in single file, each\r\nman carrying his bag of powder, Home’s party—by this time reduced to\r\nnearly one-half of its number—crossed, flung down the bags of powder at\r\nthe foot of the gate, and then leaped into the ditch for cover, leaving\r\nthe firing party behind to make the explosion.\r\n\r\nSalkeld came up at a run, carrying the port-fire in his hand, his men,\r\nwith bent heads, racing beside him. Salkeld fell, shot through the leg\r\nand arm; but, like the runner in Greek games, he handed the port-fire as\r\nhe fell to Corporal Burgess, who in turn, as he bent over the powder, was\r\nshot dead. Lord Roberts says that in falling he yet ignited the powder.\r\nMalleson, on the other hand, says that Sergeant Carmichael snatched the\r\nport-fire from the dying hand of Burgess, lit the fuse, and then, in his\r\nturn, fell mortally wounded. On this another brave fellow named Smith,\r\nthinking Carmichael had failed, ran forward to seize the port-fire, but\r\nsaw the fuse burning, and leaped into the ditch, just in time to escape\r\nthe explosion.\r\n\r\nIn a moment there was a blast as of thunder, and—not the gate\r\nunfortunately, but merely the little wicket in it, had vanished! The\r\nbugler from the ditch sounded the advance; but such was the tumult of\r\nbattle now raging that the storming parties of the 52nd, waiting eagerly\r\nto make their rush, heard neither the explosion nor the bugle-call.\r\nCampbell, their colonel, however, had seen the flame of the explosion,\r\nand gave the word. The storming party and the supports, all intermixed,\r\nran forward at the double, they crossed, man after man, the single beam\r\nremaining of the bridge, and crept through the wicket. They found within\r\nthe gate an overturned cannon, and some blackened Sepoy corpses. The main\r\nbody followed, and from the two breaches and the Cashmere Gate the three\r\ncolumns met, breathless, confused, but triumphant, in the open space\r\nbetween the Cashmere Gate and the church.\r\n\r\nThe fourth column alone of the assaulting parties practically failed.\r\nA battle is always rich in blunders; and the guns, which were to\r\nhave accompanied the column, somehow failed to arrive, and Reid, its\r\ncommander, pushed on without them. He had to face an unbroken wall 18\r\nfeet high, lined with guns and marksmen. Reid himself fell, wounded and\r\ninsensible, and there was some confusion as to who should take his place\r\nas leader. It was expected that the Lahore Gate would have been opened\r\nfrom within by the advance of the first column, but, before the Lahore\r\nGate was reached from within the city by the British, the fourth column\r\nfound itself unable to sustain the murderous fire from the walls, and\r\nfell back into cover.\r\n\r\nThe Sepoys, in their exultation, actually ventured upon a sally, and Hope\r\nGrant had to bring up the scanty cavalry of the camp to check the advance\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry could not charge, for this would bring them under the fire\r\nof the walls; they would not withdraw, for this would uncover the camp.\r\nThey could only sit grimly in their saddles, and hold back the enemy by\r\nthe menace of their presence, while men and horses went down unceasingly\r\nunder the sleet of fire which broke over them. “For more than two\r\nhours,” says Hodson, “we had to sit on our horses, under the heaviest\r\nfire, without the chance of doing anything. My young regiment behaved\r\nadmirably, as did all hands. The slaughter was great. Lamb’s troop lost\r\ntwenty-seven men out of forty-eight, and nineteen horses, and the whole\r\ncavalry suffered in the same proportion.”\r\n\r\nHope Grant tells how he praised the 9th Lancers for their cool\r\nsteadiness, and the men answered from the ranks that they were ready to\r\nstand as long as he chose. “Hodson,” says one officer who was present,\r\n“sat like a man carved in stone, apparently as unconcerned as the\r\nsentries at the Horse Guards, and only by his eyes and his ready hand,\r\nwhenever occasion offered, could you have told that he was in deadly\r\nperil, and the balls flying among us as thick as hail!”\r\n\r\nDelhi in shape roughly resembles an egg, and, in the assault we have\r\ndescribed, the British had cracked, so to speak, the small end. Inside\r\nthe Cashmere Gate was a comparatively clear space, a church, a Hindoo\r\ntemple, and a mosque being scattered along its southern boundary. These\r\nowed their existence to the somewhat mixed piety of James Skinner, a\r\ngallant soldier, who played a brilliant part in Clive’s wars. His mother\r\nwas a Hindoo lady, his wife was a Mohammedan; and, being severely wounded\r\nin some engagement, Skinner vowed, if he recovered, he would build\r\nthree places of worship—a church, a temple, and a mosque! And the three\r\nbuildings which stand opposite the Cashmere Gate are the fruits of that\r\nvery composite act of piety. The three assaulting columns, in broken\r\norder and sadly reduced in numbers, but in resolute fighting mood, were\r\nre-formed in the open space in front of these buildings.\r\n\r\nThe third column, under Colonel Campbell, cleared the buildings on its\r\nleft front, and then pushed forward on its perilous way straight through\r\nthe centre of the city towards the Jumma Musjid, a huge mosque that\r\nlifted its great roof high above the streets and gardens of the city more\r\nthan two miles distant. The first and second columns, now practically\r\nforming one, swung to the right, and, following the curve of the “egg” to\r\nwhich we compared Delhi, proceeded to clear what was called the Rampart\r\nRoad, a narrow lane running immediately within the wall round the whole\r\ncity. It was intended to push along this lane till the Lahore Gate was\r\nreached and seized. The Lahore Gate is the principal entrance into the\r\ncity, the main street—the Chandin Chouk, the Silver Bazaar—runs from it\r\nto the King’s Palace, bisecting the “egg” which forms the city. If this\r\ngate were carried, Delhi was practically in the British possession.\r\n\r\nThe column, led by Jones, pushed eagerly on. The Moree Gate and the Cabul\r\nGate were seized, the guns on the ramparts were captured, and the leading\r\nfiles of the advance came in sight of the Lahore Gate. A lane, a little\r\nmore than two hundred and fifty yards long, led to it; but that narrow,\r\ncrooked path was “a valley of death” more cruel and bloody than that down\r\nwhich Cardigan’s Light Cavalry rode in the famous charge at Balaclava.\r\nThe city wall itself formed the boundary of the lane on the right; the\r\nleft was formed by a mass of houses, with flat roofs and parapets,\r\ncrowded with riflemen. The lane was scarcely ten yards wide at its\r\nbroadest part; in places it was narrowed to three feet by the projecting\r\nbuttresses of the wall.\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred and fifty yards up the lane was planted a brass gun,\r\nsheltered by a bullet-proof screen. At the further extremity of the\r\nlane, where the ground rose, was a second gun, placed so as to cover the\r\nfirst, and itself covered by a bullet-proof screen. Then, like a massive\r\nwall, crossing the head of the lane, rose the great Burn Bastion, heavily\r\narmed, and capable of holding a thousand men. A force of some 8000\r\nmen, too, had just poured into the city through the Lahore and Ajmeer\r\nGates, returning from the sally they had made on Reid’s column; and\r\nthese swarmed round the side and head of the lane to hold it against the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, did soldiers undertake a more desperate feat than that\r\nof fighting a way through this “gate of hell,” held by Sepoys, it will\r\nbe noted, full of triumph, owing to their repulse of the attack of the\r\nfourth column under Reid already described. But never was a desperate\r\ndeed more gallantly attempted.\r\n\r\nThe attacking party was formed of the 1st Bengal Fusileers; and, their\r\nofficers leading, the men ran with a dash at the lane. They were scourged\r\nwith fire from the roofs to the left; the guns in their front swept the\r\nlane with grape. But the men never faltered. They took the first gun\r\nwith a rush, and raced on for the second. But the lane narrowed, and the\r\n“jam” checked the speed of the men. The fire of the enemy, concentrated\r\non a front so narrow, was murderous. Stones and round shot thrown by hand\r\nfrom the roofs and parapets of the houses were added to musketry bullets\r\nand grape, and the stormers fell back, panting and bleeding, but still\r\nfull of the wrath of battle, and leaving the body of many a slain comrade\r\nscattered along the lane.\r\n\r\nTwo or three men refused to turn back, and actually reached the screen\r\nthrough which the further gun was fired. One of these was Lieutenant\r\nButler, of the 1st Bengal Fusileers. As he came at the run through the\r\nwhite smoke he struck the screen heavily with his body; at that moment\r\ntwo Sepoys on the inner side thrust through the screen with their\r\nbayonets. The shining deadly points of steel passed on either side of\r\nButler’s body, and he was pinned between them as between the suddenly\r\nappearing prongs of a fork! Butler, twisting his head, saw through a\r\nloophole the faces of the two Sepoys who held the bayonets, and who were\r\nstill vehemently pushing, under the belief that they held their enemy\r\nimpaled. With his revolver he coolly shot them both, and then fell back,\r\npelted with bullets, but, somehow, unhurt, to his comrades, who were\r\nreforming for a second charge at the head of the lane.\r\n\r\nOn came the Fusileers again, a cluster of officers leading, well in\r\nadvance of their men. Major Jacob, who commanded the regiment, raced in\r\nthat heroic group. Speke was there, the brother of the African explorer;\r\nGreville, Wemyss, and the gallant Butler once again. The first gun in the\r\nlane was captured once more, and Greville, a cool and skilful soldier,\r\npromptly spiked it. But the interval betwixt the first gun and the\r\nsecond, had to be crossed. It was only a hundred yards, but on every foot\r\nof it a ceaseless and fiery hail of shot was beating. The officers, as\r\nthey led, went down one by one. Jacob, one of the most gallant soldiers\r\nof the whole siege, fell, mortally wounded. Jacob’s special quality\r\nas a soldier was a strangely gentle but heroic coolness. The flame of\r\nbattle left him at the temperature of an icicle; its thunder did not\r\nquicken his pulse by a single beat, and his soldiers had an absolute and\r\nexultant confidence in the quick sight, the swift action, the unfaltering\r\ncomposure of their gallant commander. Some of his men halted to pick him\r\nup when he fell, but he called to them to leave him, and press forward.\r\nSix other officers, one after another, were struck down; the rush\r\nslackened, it paused, the men ebbed sullenly back; the second attack had\r\nfailed!\r\n\r\nNicholson, as the officer in general command of the assaulting columns,\r\nmight well have remained at the Cashmere Gate, controlling the movements\r\nof the columns; but his eager, vehement spirit carried him always to the\r\nfighting front. He first accompanied Campbell’s column on its perilous\r\nmarch, but then rejoined his own proper column just as it came in sight\r\nof the Lahore Gate. The officers immediately about him—men themselves of\r\nthe highest daring—advised that, as the attack of the fourth column had\r\nfailed, it would be wise strategy to hold strongly the portion of the\r\ncity they had carried and reorganise another general assault. They had\r\ndone enough for the day. Their men had lost heavily, and were exhausted.\r\nThey were in ignorance of the fortunes of the other columns.\r\n\r\nBut Nicholson’s fiery spirit was impatient of half measures or of delays.\r\nHe was eager, moreover, to check the dangerous elation caused amongst the\r\nSepoys by their repulse of the fourth column. So he resolutely launched\r\na new assault on the Lahore Gate. How gallantly the officers led in an\r\nattack which yet their judgment condemned has been told.\r\n\r\nNicholson watched the twice-repeated rush of the Fusileers, and the fall,\r\none by one, of the officers who led them. When the men for a second time\r\nfell back, Nicholson himself sprang into the lane, and, waving his\r\nsword, called on his men, with the deep, vibrating voice all knew, to\r\nfollow their general. But even while he spoke, his sword pointing up the\r\nlane, his face, full of the passion of battle, turned towards the broken,\r\nstaggering front of his men, a Sepoy leaned from the window of a house\r\nclose by, pointed his musket across a distance of little more than three\r\nyards at Nicholson’s tall and stately figure, and shot him through the\r\nbody. Nicholson fell. The wound was mortal; but, raising himself up on\r\nhis elbow, he still called on the men to “go on.” He rejected impatiently\r\nthe eager help that was offered to him, and declared he would lie there\r\ntill the lane was carried. But, as Kaye puts it, he was asking dying what\r\nhe had asked living—that which was all but impossible.\r\n\r\nColonel Graydon tells how he stooped over the fallen Nicholson, and\r\nbegged to be allowed to convey him to a place of safety; but Nicholson\r\ndeclared “he would allow no man to remove him, but would die there.” It\r\nwas, in fact, a characteristic flash of chivalry that made Nicholson at\r\nlast consent to be removed. He would allow no one to touch him, says\r\nTrotter, “except Captain Hay, of the 60th Native Infantry, with whom he\r\nwas not upon friendly terms. ‘I will make up my difference with you,\r\nHay,’ he gasped out. ‘I will let you take me back.’”\r\n\r\nThe lane was strewn with the British dead. To carry it without artillery\r\nwas hopeless. There were no better soldiers on the Ridge than the 1st\r\nBengal Fusileers—“the dear old dirty-shirts” of Lord Lake. When they, on\r\nthe morning of that day, broke through the embrasures of the Cashmere\r\nbattery, one of their officers has left on record the statement that\r\n“the Sepoys fled as they saw the white faces of the Fusileers looking\r\nsternly at them.” They fled, that is, not from thrust of steel and flash\r\nof musket, but before the mere menace of those threatening, war-hardened\r\ncountenances! The 1st, as a matter of fact, had their muskets slung\r\nbehind, to enable them to use their hands in climbing the breach, and so,\r\nwhen they came up the crest of the breach and through the embrasures,\r\nthe men had no muskets in their hands. The threat written on their faces\r\nliterally put the Sepoys to flight. Where such men as these had failed,\r\nwhat troops could succeed?\r\n\r\nThe column fell slowly and sullenly back to the Cabul Gate, the wounded\r\nbeing sent to the rear. Lord Roberts tells us that, being sent by Wilson\r\nto ascertain how affairs were going on in the city, he observed as he\r\nrode through the Cashmere Gate a doolie by the side of the road without\r\nbearers, and with evidently a wounded man inside. He says:—\r\n\r\n    I dismounted to see if I could be of any use to the occupant,\r\n    when I found, to my grief and consternation, that it was John\r\n    Nicholson, with death written on his face. He told me that the\r\n    bearers had put the doolie down and had gone off to plunder;\r\n    that he was in great pain, and wished to be taken to the\r\n    hospital. He was lying on his back, no wound was visible, and\r\n    but for the pallor of his face, always colourless, there was no\r\n    sign of the agony he must have been enduring. On my expressing\r\n    a hope that he was not seriously wounded, he said, “I am dying;\r\n    there is no chance for me.” The sight of that great man lying\r\n    helpless and on the point of death was almost more than I could\r\n    bear. Other men had daily died around me, friends and comrades\r\n    had been killed beside me, but I never felt as I felt then—to\r\n    lose Nicholson seemed to me at that moment to lose everything.\r\n\r\nNicholson’s fall, it is striking to note, impressed every one in that\r\ntiny and heroic army at Delhi exactly as it impressed Roberts. He\r\nlingered through all the days of slow, stubborn, resolute fighting, which\r\nwon Delhi; but day by day the news about Nicholson’s fluctuating life\r\nwas almost more important than the tidings that this position or that\r\nhad been carried. Nicholson was a man with Clive’s genius for battle\r\nand mastery over men, while in the qualities of chivalry and honour he\r\ndeserved to be classed with Outram or Havelock. He was only thirty-seven\r\nwhen he died; what fame he might have won, had he lived, no man can tell.\r\nHe was certainly one of the greatest soldiers the English-speaking race\r\nhas produced.\r\n\r\nMany monuments have been erected to Nicholson; one over his actual grave,\r\nanother—with an unfortunately elaborate inscription—in the parish church\r\nat Lisburn. But the fittest and most impressive monument is a plain\r\nobelisk erected on the crest of the Margalla Pass, the scene, in 1848, of\r\none of his most daring exploits. There in the wild border pass stands the\r\ngreat stone pillar, and round it still gathers many a native tradition of\r\nthe daring and might of the great sahib. Sir Donald Macnab says that when\r\nthe worshippers of “Nikkul-Seyn” in Hazara heard of his death, “they came\r\ntogether to lament, and one of them stood forth and said there was no\r\ngain from living in a world that no longer held Nikalsain. So he cut his\r\nthroat deliberately and died.” The others, however, reflected that this\r\nwas not the way to serve their great guru; they must learn to worship\r\n“Nikalsain’s God”; and the entire sect actually accepted Christianity on\r\nthe evidence of Nicholson’s personality!\r\n\r\nCampbell’s column, meanwhile, had fought its way across two-thirds of\r\nthe city, and come in sight of the massive arched gateway of the Jumma\r\nMusjid. But the engineers that accompanied the column had fallen;\r\nCampbell had no artillery to batter down the great gate of the mosque,\r\nand no bags of powder with which to blow it up. He was, however, a\r\nstubborn Scottish veteran, and he clung to his position in front of the\r\nmosque till he learnt of the failure to carry the Lahore Gate. Then,\r\njudging with soldierly coolness that it would be impossible to hold\r\nunsupported the enormously advanced position he had won, he fell back in\r\nleisurely fashion till he came into touch with the reserve column at the\r\nCashmere Gate.\r\n\r\nThe British columns had been fighting for over six hours, and had lost 66\r\nofficers and 1104 men, or very nearly every fourth man in the assaulting\r\nforce. Amongst the fallen, too, were many of the most daring spirits in\r\nthe whole force, the men who were the natural leaders in every desperate\r\nenterprise. Less than 4000 of the brave men who followed Nicholson and\r\nJones and Campbell across the breaches or through the Cashmere Gate that\r\nmorning remained unwounded, and there were 40,000 Sepoys yet in Delhi! Of\r\nthe great “egg,” too, which formed the city, the British held only the\r\ntiny northern extremity.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions Wilson’s nerve once more failed him. He doubted\r\nwhether he ought to persist in the assault. Was it not safer to fall back\r\non the Ridge? Repeatedly, in fact, through the days of stubborn fighting\r\nwhich followed, Wilson meditated the fatal policy of retreat. He was\r\nworn-out in mind and body. His nerve had failed at Meerut when the Mutiny\r\nfirst broke out; it threatened to fail again here at Delhi, in the very\r\ncrisis of the assault. To walk a few steps exhausted him. And it was\r\nfortunate for the honour of England and the fate of India that Wilson\r\nhad round him at that crisis men of sterner fibre than his own. Some one\r\ntold Nicholson, as he lay on his death-bed, of Wilson’s hesitations.\r\n“Thank God,” whispered Nicholson. “I have strength yet to shoot him if\r\nnecessary!”\r\n\r\nWilberforce, in his “Unrecorded Chapter of the Indian Mutiny,” gives a\r\nsomewhat absurd, and not too credible, account of the incident which,\r\naccording to him, kept Wilson’s nerve steady at that crisis. The 52nd,\r\nafter so many hours of fighting, had fallen back on the reserve at the\r\nCashmere Gate, and Wilberforce, who belonged to that regiment, was\r\noccupied with a brother officer in compounding a “long” glass of brandy\r\nand soda to quench his thirst. His companion poured in so generous an\r\nallowance of brandy that he was afraid to drink it. He says:—\r\n\r\n    Not liking to waste it, we looked round us, and saw a group of\r\n    officers on the steps of the church, apparently engaged in an\r\n    animated conversation. Among them was an old man, who looked as\r\n    if a good “peg” (the common term for a brandy and soda) would\r\n    do him good. Drawing, therefore, nearer the group, in order to\r\n    offer the “peg” to the old officer, we heard our colonel say,\r\n    “All I can say is that I won’t retire, but will hold the walls\r\n    with my regiment.” I then offered our “peg” to the old officer,\r\n    whom we afterwards knew to be General Wilson. He accepted it,\r\n    drank it off, and a few minutes after we heard him say, “You\r\n    are quite right—to retire would be to court disaster; we will\r\n    stay where we are!”\r\n\r\n“On such little matters,” Wilberforce gravely reflects, “great events\r\noften depend!” The course of British history in India, in a word, was\r\ndecisively affected by that accidental glass of brandy and soda he\r\noffered to General Wilson! It tightened his shaken nerves to the key of\r\nresolution! Wilberforce’s book belongs rather to the realm of fiction\r\nthan of grave history, and his history-making glass of brandy and soda\r\nmay be dismissed as a flight of fancy. It was the cool judgment and the\r\nunfaltering daring of men like Baird Smith and Neville Chamberlain, and\r\nother gallant spirits immediately around Wilson, which saved him from\r\nthe tragedy of a retreat. When Wilson asked Baird Smith whether it was\r\npossible to hold the ground they had won, the curt, decisive answer of\r\nthat fine soldier was, “We _must_ hold it!” And that white flame of\r\nheroic purpose burnt just as intensely in the whole circle of Wilson’s\r\nadvisers.\r\n\r\nThe British troops held their position undisturbed on the night of the\r\n14th. The 15th was spent in restoring order and preparing for a new\r\nassault. There is a curious conflict of testimony as to whether or not\r\nthe troops had got out of hand owing to mere drunkenness. It is certain\r\nthat enormous stores of beer, spirits, and wine were found in that\r\nportion of the city held by the British. Lord Roberts says, “I did not\r\nsee a single drunken man throughout the day of assault, and I visited\r\nevery position held by our troops within the walls of the city.” This bit\r\nof evidence seems final. Yet it would be easy to quote a dozen witnesses\r\nto prove that there was drunkenness to a perilous extent amongst the\r\ntroops, and it is certain that Wilson found it expedient to give orders\r\nfor the destruction of the whole of the vast stores of beer and spirits\r\nwhich had fallen into his hands.\r\n\r\nA new plan of attack was devised by the engineers. Batteries were armed\r\nwith guns captured from the enemy, and a destructive fire maintained on\r\nthe chief positions yet held in the city. The attacks, too, were now\r\ndirected, not along the narrow streets and winding lanes of the city, but\r\nthrough the houses themselves. Thus wall after wall was broken through,\r\nhouse after house captured, the Sepoys holding them were bayoneted, and\r\nso a stern and bloody path was driven to the Lahore Gate.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th the famous magazine which Willoughby had blown up, when\r\nDelhi fell into the hands of the rebels early in May, was captured,\r\nand it was found that Willoughby’s heroic act had been only partially\r\nsuccessful. The magazine, that is, was less than half destroyed, and the\r\nBritish found in it no fewer than 171 guns, mostly of large calibre,\r\nwith enormous stores of ammunition. The Sepoys read their doom in the\r\nconstant flight of shells from the British batteries in the city. They\r\nread it, in almost plainer characters, in the stubborn daring with which\r\na path was being blasted through the mass of crowded houses towards the\r\nLahore Gate. And from the southern extremity of the city there commenced\r\na great human leakage, a perpetual dribble of deserting Sepoys and flying\r\nbudmashes.\r\n\r\nLord Roberts served personally with the force driving its resolute way\r\nacross houses, courtyards, and lanes, towards the Lahore Gate, and he\r\ntells, graphically, the story of its exploits. On September 19, the men\r\nhad broken their way through to the rear of the Burn Bastion. Only the\r\nwidth of the lane separated them from the bastion itself. The little\r\nparty, 100 strong—only one-half of them British—gathered round the door\r\nthat opened on the lane, the engineer officer burst it open, and Gordon,\r\nof the 75th Foot, leading, the handful of gallant men dashed across the\r\nlane, leaped upon the ramp, raced up it, and jumped into the bastion.\r\nThey bayoneted or shot its guards, and captured the bastion without\r\nlosing a man!\r\n\r\nThe next day, with great daring, Roberts and Lang of the Engineers,\r\nfollowing a native guide, crept through the tangle of courtyards and\r\nlanes, till they reached the upper room of a house within fifty yards\r\nof the Lahore Gate. “From the window of this room,” says Roberts, “we\r\ncould see beneath us the Sepoys lounging about, engaged in cleaning their\r\nmuskets and other occupations; while some, in a lazy sort of fashion,\r\nwere acting as sentries over the gateway and two guns, one of which\r\npointed in the direction of the Sabzi Mandi, the other down the lane\r\nbehind the ramparts, leading to the Burn Bastion and Cabul Gate. I could\r\nsee from the number on their caps that these Sepoys belonged to the 5th\r\nNative Infantry.” The troops were brought up silently by the same route,\r\nand leaped suddenly on the gate, capturing it, and slaying or putting to\r\nterrified flight the Sepoys whom Lang and Roberts had watched in such a\r\nmood of careless and opium-fed unconcern only a few minutes before.\r\n\r\nThe party that captured the Lahore Gate then moved up the great street\r\nrunning from it through the Silver Bazaar—its shops all closed—till they\r\nreached the Delhi Bank, which they carried. Another column forced its way\r\ninto the Jumma Musjid, blowing in its gates without loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDELHI: RETRIBUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remained the great palace, the last stronghold of the Mutiny, a\r\nbuilding famous in history and in romance. The 60th Rifles were launched\r\nagainst it, the gates were blown open, and the troops broke their way\r\nin. They found it practically deserted. The garrison had fled, the king\r\nand his household were fugitives, and the clash of British bayonets,\r\nthe tramp of British feet, rang through the abandoned halls and ruined\r\ncorridors of the palace of the Mogul.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the garrison from the imperial palace had been hastened by\r\na very gallant feat of arms. Between the palace and the bridge crossing\r\nthe Jumna is a strong fort, a sort of outwork to the palace, called the\r\nSelingarh. An officer, Lieutenant Aikman, with a party of Wilde’s Sikhs,\r\nhad been despatched to reconnoitre along the river front. Aikman, who\r\nknew the ground thoroughly, and who was of a daring temper, determined to\r\nmake a dash at the Selingarh, and so prevent the escape of the king and\r\nhis court across the river. With his handful of Sikhs, Aikman carried the\r\nSelingarh with one fierce rush, and seized the passage connecting the\r\nrear gate of the palace with the fort, thus plugging up that opportunity\r\nfor flight. The king, with his court, as it happened, had fled already,\r\nbut as Aikman held the rear gate of the palace, while the 60th Rifles\r\nblew in its front gates, all who remained in it were made prisoners.\r\n\r\nThat the imperial palace should have been carried almost without loss of\r\nlife seems wonderful. It proves how completely the spirit of the Sepoys\r\nhad been broken by the fiery valour of the British assaults. Yet even\r\nthe capture of the palace was marked by some curious, though isolated,\r\nexamples of courage on the part of the rebels.\r\n\r\nHope Grant, for example, records that a sentry was found at one of the\r\npalace gates dressed and equipped according to regulation, and marching\r\nup and down on his beat with his musket on his shoulder. “In a museum\r\nat Naples,” he adds, “is to be seen the skull and helmet of a man who\r\nwas found buried at his post in a sentry-box in the midst of the lava.\r\nThe inscription states the occupant to have been a ‘brave soldier’; but\r\nnothing could have been braver or cooler than the conduct of this Sepoy,\r\nwho must have known that his fate was sealed.” Roberts, who shared in\r\nthe rush for the palace gates, adds another curious example of Sepoy\r\ncourage. They found the recesses in the long passage which led to the\r\npalace buildings packed with wounded men, but about thirty yards up the\r\npassage stood a Sepoy in the uniform of a grenadier of the 37th Native\r\nInfantry. The man stood quietly as the British came along the passage,\r\nwith his musket on his hip. Then he coolly raised his musket and fired\r\nat the advancing party, sending his bullet through the helmet of the\r\nleading Englishman. Next, dropping his musket to the level, he charged\r\nsingle-handed down on the entire detachment of the 60th, and was killed!\r\n\r\nColonel Jones, who commanded the Rifles, sent a pencilled note to Wilson\r\nannouncing, with soldier-like brevity, “Blown open the gate and got\r\npossession of the palace.”\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on the morning of September 21 a royal salute rang over Delhi,\r\nits pulses of deep sound proclaiming to all India that the sacred city,\r\nthe home and stronghold of the revolt, was once more in British hands.\r\nThat same day Wilson moved in from his rough camp on the Ridge, and\r\nestablished his headquarters in the Dewan-i-khas, the king’s private hall\r\nof audience.\r\n\r\nBut if Delhi was captured, the King of Delhi, with all the leading\r\nfigures in the Mutiny, yet remained free, and might easily become the\r\ncentre of new troubles. The rebel commander-in-chief felt that the game\r\nwas up when the Burn Bastion was carried, and he fled from the city\r\nthat night, carrying with him most of his troops. He urged the king to\r\nflee with him, and to renew the war in the open country, where his name\r\nwould have all the magical charm of a spell on the imagination of the\r\ncommon people. But the unhappy king was old and tired. His nerve had been\r\ndissolved in the sloth and sensualities of an Indian court. His favourite\r\nwife strongly opposed flight, in the interests of her child, whom she\r\nhoped to see succeeding the king.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy monarch, in a word, could neither flee nor stay, and he took\r\nrefuge in a stately cluster of famous buildings named Humayon’s Tomb,\r\nsome seven miles out of Delhi. Hodson, the daring and famous captain\r\nof Light Horse, ascertained this, and with some trouble extracted from\r\nWilson permission to attempt the capture of the king, with strict\r\ninstructions to promise him his life. Taking fifty picked men from his\r\nregiment, Hodson rode out on one of the most audacious expeditions ever\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nThe road to Humayon’s Tomb at one point runs underneath a strong tower,\r\nwhere the king had at first taken refuge, and which was still filled\r\nwith his adherents. Fierce dark faces looked down from its parapets and\r\nfrom every arrow-slit in its walls as Hodson, with his little cluster\r\nof horsemen, rode past. But in the Englishman’s stern face and cool,\r\nunflurried bearing there was something which awed those who looked on\r\nhim, and not a shot was fired as the party rode by on their stern errand.\r\n\r\nHodson and his men reached the spot where the tomb lifts its dome of\r\nstainless marble high in the air. In one of the chambers of that great\r\npillar sat, trembling, the last heir of the house of Timour; in the\r\ncloisters at its foot were some thousands of the servants and hangers-on\r\nof the palace, armed and excited.\r\n\r\nFor two hours Hodson sat in his saddle before the gate, his men posted—a\r\nslender chain of cavalry—round the tomb, while messengers passed to\r\nand fro between him and the king. “Picture to yourself,” said Hodson’s\r\nbrother, when telling the story, “the scene before that magnificent\r\ngateway, with the milk-white domes of the tomb towering up from within.\r\nOne white man, amongst a host of natives, determined to secure his\r\nprisoner or perish in the attempt!”\r\n\r\nThe king at last consented to come out and deliver himself to Hodson, but\r\nonly on condition that he repeated with his own lips Wilson’s promise\r\nof safety for his life. Presently the king came out, carried in a\r\nbullock-carriage, and Hodson spurred his horse forward and demanded the\r\nking’s arms. The king asked him whether he were Hodson Bahadur, and if he\r\npromised him his life. Hodson gave the required promise, but added grimly\r\nthat if any attempt were made at a rescue he would shoot the king down\r\nlike a dog! Then the procession, at a foot walk, moved on to the city,\r\nthousands of natives following and gazing in wonder at the lordly figure\r\nof that solitary Englishman carrying off their king alone. But Hodson’s\r\ncalm and dauntless bearing acted as a spell on the crowd.\r\n\r\nBit by bit the multitude slunk away, and, with his fifty horsemen and his\r\ngroup of prisoners, Hodson rode up to the Lahore Gate. “What have you got\r\nin that palkee?” asked the officer on duty. “Only the King of Delhi!”\r\nsaid Hodson. The clustering guard at the gate were with difficulty kept\r\nfrom cheering. The little group moved up the stately Silver Bazaar to\r\nthe palace gate, where Hodson delivered over his royal prisoners to\r\nthe civil officer in charge. “By Jove, Hodson,” said that astonished\r\nofficial, “they ought to make you Commander-in-Chief for this!” When\r\nHodson reported his success to Wilson, that general’s ungracious and\r\ncharacteristic comment was, “Well, I’m glad you’ve got him. But I never\r\nexpected to see either you or him again!”\r\n\r\nHope Grant tells how he went to see the fallen monarch in his prison:—\r\n\r\n    He was an old man, said by one of the servants to be ninety\r\n    years of age, short in stature, slight, very fair for a native,\r\n    and with a high-bred, delicate-looking cast of features. Truly\r\n    the dignity had departed from the Great Mogul, whose ancestors\r\n    had once been lords of princely possessions in India. It might\r\n    have been supposed that death would have been preferable to\r\n    such humiliation, but it is wonderful how we all cling to the\r\n    shreds of life. When I saw the poor old man he was seated on a\r\n    wretched charpoy, or native bed, with his legs crossed before\r\n    him, and swinging his body backwards and forwards with an\r\n    unconscious dreamy look. I asked him one or two questions, and\r\n    was surprised to hear an unpleasantly vulgar voice answering\r\n    from behind a small screen. I was told that this proceeded from\r\n    his begum, or queen, who prevented him from replying, fearful\r\n    lest he might say something which should compromise their\r\n    safety.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Temple, who prepared the evidence for the trial of the\r\nex-king of Delhi, paid many visits to the ill-fated monarch during\r\nhis confinement. “It was a strange sight,” he says, “to see the aged\r\nman, seated in a darkened chamber of his palace; the finely chiselled\r\nfeatures, arched eyebrows, aquiline profile, the sickly pallor of the\r\nolive complexion, nervous twitching of the face, delicate fingers\r\ncounting beads, muttering speech, incoherent language, irritable\r\nself-consciousness—altogether made up a curious picture. Here sat the\r\nlast of the Great Moguls, the descendant of emperors two centuries ago\r\nruling the second largest population in the world; who had himself,\r\nthough a phantom sovereign, been treated with regal honours. He was now\r\nabout to be tried for his life by judges whose forefathers had sued for\r\nfavour and protection from his imperial ancestors.”\r\n\r\nBut there still remained uncaptured the two sons and the grandson of\r\nthe king. The princes had a very evil fame. They had tortured and\r\nslain English prisoners. They had been the leading figures in the\r\nMutiny. Their hands were red with innocent blood, the blood of little\r\nchildren and of helpless women. The princes—Mirza Mogul, at one time the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the rebel forces, Mirza Khejoo Sultan, and Mirza\r\nAboo Bukir, the son of the late heir-apparent—with some 6000 or 7000\r\nfollowers, had occupied Humayon’s Tomb after the king’s capture, partly\r\nin a mood of fatalistic despair, and partly with the expectation that\r\nthey might find the same mercy the king had found.\r\n\r\nMacdowell, who was second in command of Hodson’s Horse, tells how, on\r\nSeptember 21, he got a note from Hodson, “Come sharp; bring 100 men.”\r\nHe rode off at once, and, on meeting, Hodson explained that he had\r\nascertained that the three princes were in Humayon’s Tomb, and he meant\r\nto bring them in.\r\n\r\nHodson rode to the tomb, halted his troop outside it, and sent in a\r\nmessenger demanding the surrender of the princes. They asked for a\r\npromise of their lives, but Hodson sternly refused any such pledge. As\r\nHodson and Macdowell sat, side by side, on their horses, they could hear\r\nthe stormy shouts of the followers of the princes begging to be led out\r\nagainst the infidels. But Hodson’s audacity and iron resolve prevailed,\r\nas they prevailed the day before in the case of the king. The princes\r\nsent word that they were coming; and presently a small bullock-cart made\r\nits appearance. The princes were in it, and behind came some 3000 armed\r\nretainers.\r\n\r\nHodson allowed the cart to come up to his line, ordered the driver to\r\nmove on, and then formed up his troop, by a single, quick movement,\r\nbetween the cart and the crowd. The troopers advanced at a walk upon the\r\ncrowd, that fell sullenly and reluctantly back. Hodson sent on the cart\r\ncontaining the princes in charge of ten of his men, while he sternly,\r\nand step by step, pressed the crowd back into the enclosure surrounding\r\nthe tomb; then, leaving his men outside, Hodson, with Macdowell and four\r\ntroopers, rode up the steps into the arch, and called on the crowd to\r\nlay down their arms. “There was a murmur,” says Macdowell, who tells\r\nthe story. “He reiterated the command, and (God knows why, I never can\r\nunderstand it!) they commenced doing so.” He adds:—\r\n\r\n    Now, you see, we didn’t want their arms, and under ordinary\r\n    circumstances would not have risked our lives in so rash a\r\n    way. But what we wanted was to gain time to get the princes\r\n    away, for we could have done nothing, had they attacked us, but\r\n    cut our way back, and very little chance of doing even this\r\n    successfully. Well, there we stayed for two hours, collecting\r\n    their arms, and I assure you I thought every moment they would\r\n    rush upon us. I said nothing, but smoked all the time, to show\r\n    I was unconcerned; but at last, when it was all done, and all\r\n    the arms collected, put in a cart, and started, Hodson turned\r\n    to me and said, “We’ll go now.” Very slowly we mounted, formed\r\n    up the troop, and cautiously departed, followed by the crowd.\r\n    We rode along quietly. You will say, why did we not charge\r\n    them? I merely say, we were one hundred men, and they were\r\n    fully 6000. I am not exaggerating; the official reports will\r\n    show you it is all true. As we got about a mile off, Hodson\r\n    turned to me and said, “Well, Mac, we’ve got them at last”;\r\n    and we both gave a sigh of relief. Never in my life, under the\r\n    heaviest fire, have I been in such imminent danger. Everybody\r\n    says it is the most dashing and daring thing that has been done\r\n    for years (not on my part, for I merely obeyed orders, but on\r\n    Hodson’s, who planned and carried it out).\r\n\r\nHodson and Macdowell quickly overtook the cart carrying the princes,\r\nbut a crowd had gathered round the vehicle, and pressed on the very\r\nhorses of the troopers. “What shall we do with them?” said Hodson to his\r\nlieutenant. Then, answering his own question, he added, “I think we had\r\nbetter shoot them here. We shall never get them in!” And Hodson proceeded\r\nto do that daring, cruel, much-abused, much-praised deed.\r\n\r\nHe halted his troop, put five troopers across the road, in front and\r\nbehind the cart, ordered the princes to strip; then, taking a carbine\r\nfrom one of his troopers, he shot them with his own hand, first, in a\r\nloud voice, explaining to his troopers and the crowd who they were, and\r\nwhat crimes they had done. The shuddering crowd gazed at this tall,\r\nstern, inflexible sahib, with his flowing beard, white face, and deep\r\nover-mastering voice, shooting one by one their princes; but no hand was\r\nlifted in protest.\r\n\r\nHodson showed no hurry. He made the doomed princes strip, that the act\r\nmight seem an execution, not a murder. He shot them with his own hand,\r\nfor, had he ordered a trooper to have done it, and the man had hesitated,\r\na moment’s pause might have kindled the huge swaying breathless crowd to\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nCritics in an overwhelming majority condemn Hodson’s act. Roberts,\r\nwhose judgment is mildest, says his feeling is “one of sorrow that such\r\na brilliant soldier should have laid himself open to so much adverse\r\ncriticism.” Hodson himself wrote on the evening of the same day, “I\r\nmade up my mind at the time to be abused. I was convinced I was right,\r\nand when I prepared to run the great physical risk of the attempt I was\r\nequally game for the moral risk of praise or blame. These have not been,\r\nand are not, times when a man who would serve his country dare hesitate\r\nas to the personal consequences to himself of what he thinks his duty.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, Hodson was scarcely a cool judge as to what “duty”\r\nmight be in such a case. The outrages which accompanied the Mutiny had\r\nkindled his fierce nature into a flame. “If ever I get into Delhi,”\r\nhe had said, weeks before, “the house of Timour won’t be worth five\r\nminutes’ purchase!” Hodson’s “five minutes” proved inadequate; but,\r\nwriting afterwards, on the very day he shot the princes, he recorded,\r\n“In twenty-four hours I disposed of the principal members of the house\r\nof Timour the Tartar. I am not cruel, but I confess I did rejoice in the\r\nopportunity of ridding the earth of these ruffians.”\r\n\r\nMacdowell writes the epitaph of the princes: “So ended the career of\r\nthe chiefs of the revolt and of the greatest villains that ever shamed\r\nhumanity.”\r\n\r\nThe bodies were driven into Delhi and cast on a raised terrace in front\r\nof the Kotwallee. Cave-Browne, who was chaplain to the forces at the\r\ntime, comments on the curious fact that this was the very spot where the\r\nworst crimes of the princes had been committed. “It was,” he says, “a\r\ndire retribution! On the very spot where, four months ago, English women\r\nand children had suffered every form of indignity and death, there now\r\nlay exposed to the scoff and scorn of the avenging army, three scions of\r\nthe royal house, who had been chief among the fiends of Delhi.”\r\n\r\nThe story of the siege of Delhi is one of the most wonderful chapters\r\nin the history of war. The besieging army never amounted to 10,000 men;\r\nit sometimes sank below 5000. For weeks the British had thus to face an\r\nenemy exceeding themselves in number sometimes by a ratio of ten to one,\r\nand with an overwhelming superiority of artillery. They fought no fewer\r\nthan thirty-two battles with the enemy, and did not lose one! For three\r\nmonths every man, not sick, in the whole force had to be under arms every\r\nday, and sometimes both by night and day. The men were scorched by the\r\nheat of the sun, wasted with dysentery and cholera, worn out with toil.\r\n\r\nA new and strange perplexity was added to the situation by the fact that\r\nmany of the native troops on the Ridge were notoriously disloyal. The\r\nBritish officers sometimes ran as much danger of being shot by their\r\nown troops behind them as by the Sepoys in front. Early in July the 4th\r\nSikhs were purged of Hindustanis, as these could not be trusted. General\r\nBarnard had to abandon one plan of assault on Delhi, because at the last\r\nmoment he discovered a conspiracy amongst the native soldiers in the camp\r\nto join the enemy. The strength of the force was sapped by sickness as\r\nwell as by disloyalty.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, for example, out of under 11,000 men 2977 were in hospital.\r\nOf their total effective force, nearly 4000—or two out of every five—were\r\nkilled, or died of wounds received in battle. Yet they never lost heart,\r\nnever faltered or murmured or failed. And after twelve weeks of such a\r\nstruggle, they at last stormed in open day a strong city, with walls\r\npractically unbreached, and defended by 30,000 revolted Sepoys. This is\r\na record never surpassed, and seldom paralleled, in history!\r\n\r\nMonths afterwards, Lawrence, looking from the Ridge over the scene of\r\nthe long and bloody struggle, said to his companion with a sigh, “Think\r\nof all the genius and bravery buried here!” The environs of Delhi, the\r\nreverse slope of that rocky crest from which the British guns thundered\r\non the rebel city, are indeed sown thick with the graves of brave men who\r\ndied to maintain the British Empire in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE STORMING OF LUCKNOW\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Delhi the tale of the Great Mutiny practically ends.\r\nLucknow, it is true, remained to be captured. The broken forces of\r\nthe mutineers had to be crushed in detail. A new system of civil\r\nadministration had to be built up. The famous Company itself vanished—the\r\nnative prophecy that the _raj_ of the Company would last only a hundred\r\nyears from Plassey thus being curiously fulfilled; and on September\r\n1, 1858—less than a year after Delhi fell—the Queen was proclaimed\r\nthroughout India as its Sovereign. But Hodson, who in addition to being a\r\ngreat soldier had a wizard-like insight into the real meaning of events,\r\nwas right when, on the evening of the day on which the British flag\r\nwas hoisted once more over the royal palace at Delhi, he wrote in his\r\njournal: “This day will be a memorable one in the annals of the empire.\r\nThe restoration of British rule in the East dates from September 20,\r\n1857.”\r\n\r\nYet there would be a certain failure in the dramatic completeness of the\r\nstory were it to end leaving Lucknow in the hands of the rebels. The\r\ntale of the storming of the capital of Oude must be added as a pendant\r\nto that other great siege which planted the British flag on the walls of\r\nDelhi.\r\n\r\nThere was, in a sense, no “siege” of Lucknow by the British. There was no\r\ninvestment, no formal approaches, no zigzag of trenches. It was a storm,\r\nrather than a siege—though the fighting stretched from March 2 to March\r\n21, 1858. But it was the last of the great military operations of the\r\ncampaign which crushed the Mutiny. The fall of the city left the historic\r\nrevolt without a centre. The war, henceforth, always excepting the\r\nbrilliant campaign of Sir Hugh Rose in the Central Provinces, became a\r\nguerilla campaign; a campaign of petty sieges, of the hunting down of one\r\nSepoy leader after another, of the rout of this petty body of mutineers,\r\nor of that. It is curious to note how great civilians and great soldiers\r\ndiffered in judgment as to the policy of undertaking the recapture of\r\nLucknow at that particular moment. Colin Campbell’s strategy was to\r\nconduct a cool campaign in the hills of Rohilcund, and leave Lucknow\r\nalone for the present. That city would serve as a sort of draining\r\nground, a centre into which all the mutineers would flow; and when cool\r\nweather came, Campbell, imprisoning Lucknow in a girdle of converging\r\ncolumns, would destroy or capture the mutineers in one vast “bag.”\r\nThis was leisurely and wary strategy; but it overlooked the political\r\nelements in the problem. It was the scheme of a soldier rather than of\r\na statesman. Lucknow, left for months undisturbed, would be a signal of\r\nhope for every revolted chief and mutinous Sepoy. It might well take the\r\nplace of Delhi as the brain and heart of the Mutiny. It would be a sign\r\nto all India that the British did not feel themselves strong enough, as\r\nyet, to strike at the centre of the rebel power.\r\n\r\nThe civilian was wiser than the soldier, and Lord Canning’s views\r\nprevailed. But it is worth noting that Colin Campbell’s plan of “bagging”\r\nall the mutineers with one vast, far-stretching sweep in Lucknow would\r\nhave been carried into effect on Lord Canning’s lines, but for a double\r\nblunder, which marked Campbell’s own conduct of the siege.\r\n\r\nIt was a great task to which the British Commander-in-chief now addressed\r\nhimself. Lucknow was a huge honeycomb of native houses; a city more than\r\ntwenty miles in circumference, with a turbulent population calculated\r\nvariously at from 300,000 to 1,000,000 people. It had a garrison of\r\n130,000 fighting men, with an overwhelming force of artillery. The Sepoy\r\nleaders, too, who knew the value of the spade in war, had spent months in\r\nmaking the city, as they believed, impregnable. Both Havelock and Colin\r\nCampbell, in fighting their way to the Residency, had broken into the\r\ncity from the eastern front; and the Sepoys, with a touching simplicity,\r\ntook it for granted that the third attack on the city would follow the\r\nlines of the earlier assaults. The British, that is, would cross the\r\ncanal, and force a path to the Residency through the great gardens and\r\nstately buildings which occupied the space betwixt the mass of the city\r\nand the Goomtee; and they accordingly barred this approach by a triple\r\nline of formidable defences. The first was a vast flanked rampart, on the\r\ninner side of the canal, and to which the canal served as a wet ditch.\r\nThe second was a great circular earthwork, like the curve of a railway\r\nembankment, which enclosed the Mess-house. Behind it rose what was, in\r\nfact, the citadel of Lucknow, the Kaisarbagh, or King’s Palace. Both\r\nthese lines stretched from the river on one flank, to the mass of houses\r\nwhich constituted the town, on the other flank. They might be pierced,\r\nthey could not be turned; and they bristled from flank to flank with\r\nheavy guns. The third line was a stupendous earthwork, covering the whole\r\nnorth front of the King’s Palace. Its guns swept the narrow space betwixt\r\nthe palace and the river with their fire.\r\n\r\nEach great building along this line of advance was itself a fortress, and\r\neverything which ingenuity could suggest, and toil execute, had been done\r\nto make the defence formidable. The task of fighting a way across these\r\ntriple lines, and through this tangle of fortified houses, each girdled\r\nwith rifle-pits, and loopholed from foundation to roof, might well have\r\nbeen deemed impossible.\r\n\r\nIn the previous November Colin Campbell had rescued the garrison of\r\nthe Residency; but he was compelled to surrender Lucknow itself to\r\nthe rebels. With great wisdom and audacity, however, he clung to the\r\nAlumbagh, planting Outram there, with a force of about 4000 men. The\r\nAlumbagh, thus held, was a sort of pistol levelled at the head of\r\nLucknow, or a spear threatening its heart. It was a perpetual menace; a\r\nsign that the British still kept their hold of the revolted city, and,\r\non some bloody errand of revenge, would speedily return to it. The task\r\nof holding a position so perilous exactly suited Outram’s cool brain\r\nand serene courage. He had nothing of Nicholson’s tempestuous valour,\r\nor of Hodson’s audacious daring. He lacked initiative. The temper which\r\nmade Nelson, at Copenhagen, put the telescope to his blind eye, when his\r\nadmiral was trying to call him off from the fight, was one which Outram\r\ncould hardly have understood; and it was a temper which certainly never\r\nstirred in his own blood. But, given a definite task, Outram might be\r\ntrusted to do it with perfect intelligence, and, if necessary, to die\r\ncheerfully in the doing of it.\r\n\r\nFor three months he held that perilous post in front of Lucknow, a tiny\r\nhandful of troops bearding a great revolted city, with a garrison of\r\n100,000 fighting men. He was attacked on front and rear and flank, and,\r\nmore than once, with a force of over 60,000 men. No less than six great\r\nattacks, indeed, can be counted. But Outram held his post with exquisite\r\nskill and unshaken valour. His troops were veterans; his officers were\r\nfighters of unsurpassed quality. Brasyer commanded his Sikhs; Barrow\r\nand Wale led his scanty squadrons of horse; Vincent Eyre, Olpherts, and\r\nMaude, commanded his guns. With such troops, and such leaders, Outram,\r\nfor more than three months, held his daring post in front of Lucknow,\r\nand beat back, with vast loss of life, the attacks hurled upon him. And\r\nthe Alumbagh, thus victoriously held, served as a screen, behind which\r\nCampbell’s forces gathered for the leap on Lucknow.\r\n\r\nColin Campbell was happily delivered from the evil condition which had\r\nhitherto fettered all the operations of the British. He was not required\r\nto attempt, with a handful of men, the task of a great army. He had\r\nunder his hands the finest fighting force any British general in India\r\nhad yet commanded, an army of 31,000 men, with 164 guns. Of these, 9000\r\nwere Ghoorkas—the Nepaulese contingent under Jung Bahadur. It was late in\r\nreaching the field, and Campbell doubted whether he ought to wait for the\r\nGhoorkas. But here, again, the civilian proved wiser than the soldier. “I\r\nam sure,” wrote Lord Canning, “we ought to wait for the Jung Bahadur, who\r\nwould be driven wild to find himself deprived of a share in the work.” It\r\nwas a political gain of the first order to show the greatest fighting\r\nprince in India arrayed under the British flag against the Mutiny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR JAMES OUTRAM, BART., G.C.B.\r\n\r\n_From a painting by THOMAS BRIGSTOCKE_]\r\n\r\nHope Grant, with the present Lord Roberts as his A.A.G., commanded the\r\ncavalry; Archdale Wilson the guns; Napier—afterwards of Magdala fame—the\r\nengineers. Outram, Lugard, and Walpole commanded the three infantry\r\ndivisions. It was a fine army, admirably officered and led, and made\r\na perfect fighting machine. And of all Campbell’s generals, no one,\r\nperhaps, served him better than did Robert Napier. He supplied the plan\r\nof attack, which made the Sepoy defences worthless, and enabled Lucknow\r\nto be carried, practically, in fourteen days, and at a loss of only 125\r\nofficers and men killed, and less than 600 wounded.\r\n\r\nThe east front, which was to be attacked, resembled, roughly, a boot laid\r\non its side. A great canal, running north and south, is the sole of the\r\n“boot”; the river Goomtee curves round the toe, and, running back sharply\r\nto the south, defines the top of the foot, and stretches up to what may\r\nbe described as the ankle. The road across the Dilkusha bridge pierces\r\nthe centre of what we have called the “sole,” and the triple line of\r\nSepoy defences barred this line of approach. Napier’s plan was to bridge\r\nthe Goomtee, pass a strong force, with heavy guns, in a wide sweep round\r\nthe “toe” of the boot, on the northern bank of the river. The heavy guns,\r\nwhen placed in position on the north bank, would take in reverse all\r\nthe Sepoy defences, and smite with a direct and overwhelming fire the\r\nchief positions—the Mess-house, the Secundrabagh, and the Residency, &c.,\r\nwhich the Sepoys held. The Sepoy generals had constructed no defences on\r\nthe north bank of the river, though it was strongly held by the rebel\r\ncavalry. Outram was to command the force operating from the north bank\r\nof the river. When his guns had swept the Sepoy defences from flank to\r\nflank, then the British left would advance, cross the Dilkusha bridge,\r\nand fight its way up to the Kaisarbagh and the Residency, Outram, with\r\nhis flanking gun-fire, always pushing ahead.\r\n\r\nThe British right and left were thus like the two blades of a pair of\r\nscissors, thrust through the web of the Sepoy defences; and when the\r\n“scissors” closed, those defences would be cut clean through from east to\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nCampbell began his operations on the morning of March 3. Forbes-Mitchell,\r\nwho stood in the ranks of the 93rd, looked out with a soldier’s eye over\r\nthe domed mosques and sky-piercing minarets of the doomed city, sharp-cut\r\nagainst the morning sky. “I don’t think,” he writes, “I ever saw a\r\nprettier scene.” Forbes-Mitchell was not an artist, only a hard-fighting\r\nprivate in the 93rd; but Russell of the _Times_, who was familiar with\r\nall the great cities of the world, was just as deeply impressed as\r\nForbes-Mitchell with the aspect that Lucknow wore that fateful morning,\r\nwhen the red tide of war was about to fill and flood its streets. This is\r\nhow Russell describes the scene: “A vision of palaces, minarets, domes,\r\nazure and golden, cupolas, colonnades, long façades of fair perspective,\r\nin pillar and column, terraced roofs—all rising up amid a calm, still\r\nocean of the brightest verdure. Look for miles and miles away, and still\r\nthe ocean spreads, and the towers of the fairy city gleam in its midst.\r\nSpires of gold glitter in the sun. Turrets and gilded spheres shine like\r\nconstellations. There is nothing mean or squalid to be seen. Here is a\r\ncity more vast than Paris, as it seems, and more brilliant, lying before\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nBut there was the grim face of war hidden beneath the mask of smiling\r\nbeauty which Lucknow presented that March morning. The soldiers, as they\r\nstood in their ranks, could see, line beyond line, the frowning Sepoy\r\ndefences; while, in the foreground, Peel, with his blue-jackets, was\r\ngetting his heavy 16-pounders into position for the fierce duel about to\r\nbegin. Colin Campbell’s movement on his left, however, was but a feint,\r\ndesigned to mislead the enemy’s generals. On the night of the 4th the\r\nconstruction of two bridges across the Goomtee was begun. On the morning\r\nof the 5th one of them was completed, and the British infantry crossed,\r\nand threw up earthworks to defend the bridge-head. By midnight on the 5th\r\nboth bridges were complete, with their approaches, and by four o’clock\r\nthe troops were crossing. Hope Grant, in command of the cavalry, covered\r\ntheir front, and drove back the enemy’s horse.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s Bays, a young regiment that had never yet been engaged, were\r\nin the advance. They got out of hand in their ardour, and rode recklessly\r\non a body of Sepoy horse, smashed them with their charge, followed them\r\nover-eagerly into broken ground, and under heavy gun-fire. They came back\r\nbroken from that wild charge, their major, Percy Smith, was killed, and\r\nthe Bays themselves suffered badly.\r\n\r\nOutram, meanwhile, had got round what we have called the “toe” of the\r\nboot, and, swinging to the left, followed the curve of the river bank\r\ntill a point was reached which took the first line of the Sepoy defences\r\nbeyond the river in reverse. Twenty-two heavy guns had been brought,\r\nby this time, across the river, and sites were chosen for two powerful\r\nbatteries. Nicholson, of the Engineers, tells how he rode with Outram to\r\nthe river bank, to choose the position of the first battery. “Got close,”\r\nhe writes, “to the end of the enemy’s lines, and found we could see into\r\nthe rear of these works. Poor creatures! They have not a grain of sense.\r\nThey have thrown up the most tremendous works, and they are absolutely\r\nuseless.” A stroke of clever generalship, in a word, had turned the Sepoy\r\nlines into mere paper screens.\r\n\r\nA building, called the Chaker Kothi, or Yellow House, had to be carried,\r\nas it commanded the site of one of the batteries. Most of the Sepoys\r\nholding the building fled when the British attacking party came on, but\r\nnine of them stubbornly clung to their post, and they fired so fast, and\r\nwith so deadly an aim, that they shot down more than their own number\r\nbefore the position was carried. It was only, indeed, by firing salvos\r\nfrom a troop of horse artillery that this stubborn little garrison was\r\ndriven out of the building at last. Then, from the summit of the Yellow\r\nHouse, a three-storey building, a flag—one of the colours of the Bengal\r\nFusileers—was set up, a signal to the British left wing that Outram’s\r\nbatteries were in position.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 9th, Outram’s guns opened on the first line of the\r\nSepoy defences, that to which the canal served as a wet ditch, with a\r\nfire that swept it from flank to flank. Campbell was pouring the fire\r\nof Peel’s guns upon the Martinere, which served as a sort of outwork to\r\nthe long canal-rampart, and at two o’clock the Highland regiments—the\r\n42nd leading, the 93rd in support—were launched on the enemy’s position.\r\nThe men of the 93rd were too impatient to be content with “supporting”\r\nthe 42nd, and the two regiments raced down the slope side by side.\r\nEarthworks, trenches, rifle-pits were leaped or clambered over, and\r\nalmost in a moment the Sepoys were in wild flight across the canal. The\r\nHighlanders, with the 4th Punjaub Rifles, followed them eagerly, and\r\nbroke through the enemy’s first line.\r\n\r\nOutram’s first battery, as we have said, was sweeping this line with\r\na cruel flank fire. The Sepoys had been driven from their guns in the\r\nbatteries that abutted on the river, and they seemed to be deserted.\r\nAdrian Hope’s men were attacking, at that moment, the farther, or\r\nsouthern, end of the line; and Butler, of the 1st Bengal Fusileers, with\r\nfour privates, ran down to the bank of the river and tried to attract the\r\nattention of the British left, some third of a mile distant; but in vain.\r\nThe river was sixty yards wide, the current ran swiftly, the farther bank\r\nwas held by Sepoy batteries; and though no Sepoys could be seen, yet\r\nit might well be that scores were crouching under its shelter. Butler,\r\nhowever, with the ready daring of youth, threw off his coat and boots,\r\nscrambled down the river bank, plunged into the stream and swam across\r\nit. He climbed up the farther bank, mounted the parapet of the abandoned\r\nwork, and, standing there, waved his arms to the distant Highlanders. It\r\nwas not a very heroic figure! His wet uniform clung to his limbs, the\r\nwater was running down hair and face. The Sepoys nigh at hand, opened a\r\nsharp fire upon him. But still that damp figure stood erect and cool,\r\nshowing, clear against the sky-line.\r\n\r\nButler was seen from the British left, and the meaning of his gestures\r\nunderstood; but a staff officer, with more punctiliousness than common\r\nsense, objected to the troops moving along the line till orders had been\r\nreceived to that effect. So a brief delay occurred. Still that damp\r\nfigure stood aloft, shot at from many points, but vehemently signalling.\r\nNow the Highlanders and Sikhs came eagerly on, and Butler, having handed\r\nover to them the battery which, wet and unarmed, he had captured,\r\nscrambled down into the river, and swam back to rejoin his regiment. It\r\nwas a gallant feat, and the Victoria Cross, which rewarded it, was well\r\nearned.\r\n\r\nThat night the British were content with holding the enemy’s first\r\nline. On the 10th Campbell, who, for all his hot Scottish temper, was\r\nthe wariest and most deliberate of generals, was content with pushing\r\nOutram’s batteries still farther up the north bank, so as to command the\r\nMess-house and the Begum’s Palace. On the left, the building known as\r\nBanks’ House was battered with artillery, and carried. The two blades of\r\nthe scissors, in a word, had been thrust far up into the city, and now\r\nthey were to be closed! Betwixt the positions held to the right and to\r\nthe left, stood the great mass of buildings known as the Begum Kothi, the\r\nBegum’s Palace. This was strongly held, and the fight which carried it\r\nwas the most stubborn and bloody of the whole operations of the siege.\r\n\r\nThe guns played fiercely upon it for hours; by the middle of the\r\nafternoon a slight breach had been effected, and it was resolved to\r\nassault. Forbes-Mitchell says that the men of the 93rd were finishing\r\ntheir dinner when they noticed a stir amongst the staff officers. The\r\nbrigadiers were putting their heads together. Suddenly the order was\r\ngiven for the 93rd to “fall in.” “This was quietly done, the officers\r\ntaking their places, the men tightening their belts, and pressing their\r\nbonnets firmly on their heads, loosening the ammunition in their pouches,\r\nand seeing that the springs of their bayonets held tight.” A few seconds\r\nwere spent in these grim preparations, then came the sharp word of\r\ncommand that stiffened the whole regiment into an attitude of silent\r\neagerness. The Begum’s Palace was to be rushed.\r\n\r\nIt was a block of buildings of vast size and strength. The breach was\r\nlittle more than a scratch in the wall of the gateway, which it needed\r\nthe activity of a goat to climb, and which only British soldiers,\r\ndaringly led, would have undertaken to assault in the teeth of a numerous\r\nenemy. And there were nearly 5000 Sepoys within that tangle of courts!\r\nThe storming party consisted of the 93rd and the 4th Punjaub Rifles, led\r\nby Adrian Hope. The 93rd led, the Punjaubees were in support, and the\r\nrush was fierce and daring. It is said that the adjutant of the 93rd,\r\nMcBean, cut down with his own sword no less than eleven of the enemy, in\r\nforcing his way through the breach; and he won the Victoria Cross by his\r\nperformance. He was an Inverness ploughman when he enlisted in the 93rd,\r\nand he rose through all its ranks until he commanded the regiment.\r\n\r\nCaptain M’Donald was shot dead while leading his men. His senior\r\nlieutenant took the company on, until the charging crowd was stopped\r\nby a ditch eighteen feet wide, and from twelve to fourteen feet deep.\r\nThe stormers leaped, with hardly a pause, into the ditch, but it seemed\r\nimpossible to climb up the farther bank. Wood, of the Grenadier company,\r\nhowever, clambered on the shoulders of a tall private, and, claymore in\r\nhand, mounted the farther side. The spectacle of a Highland bonnet and\r\nmenacing claymore, making its appearance above the ditch, proved too\r\nmuch for the Sepoys. They fled, and Wood pulled up man after man by the\r\nmuzzle of his rifle—the rifles, it may be mentioned as an interesting\r\ndetail, were all loaded, and on full cock! Highlanders and Punjaubees,\r\nracing side by side, had now broken into the great palace. Every doorway\r\nwas barred and loopholed, and the Sepoys fought desperately; but the\r\nHighlanders, with the Punjaubees in generous rivalry, broke through\r\nbarrier after barrier, till they reached the inner square, filled with\r\na mass of Sepoys. “The word,” Forbes-Mitchell says, was “keep well\r\ntogether, men, and use the bayonet,” and that order was diligently\r\nobeyed. The combat raged for over two hours, the pipe-major of the\r\n93rd blowing his pipes shrilly during the whole time. “I knew,” he\r\nsaid afterwards, “our boys would fight all the better while they heard\r\nthe bagpipes.” When the main fight was over, in the inner court of the\r\nBegum’s Palace, alone, over 860 of the enemy lay dead. Colin Campbell\r\nhimself described it as “the sternest struggle which occurred during the\r\nsiege.”\r\n\r\nThat most gallant, but ill-fated soldier, Adrian Hope, personally led one\r\nof the storming parties. It is said that he got in through a window, up\r\nto which he was lifted, and through which he was pushed by his men. He\r\nwas sent headlong and sprawling upon a group of Sepoys in the dark room\r\ninside. That apparition of the huge, red-headed Celt tumbling upon them,\r\nsword and pistol in hand, was too much for the Sepoys, and they fled\r\nwithout striking a blow!\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most gallant soldier that perished within the blood-splashed\r\ncourts of Begum Kothi was Hodson, of “Hodson’s Horse.” Robert Napier\r\ntells the story of how, when he was in the act of reconnoitring the\r\nbreach, he found Hodson suddenly standing beside him, and saying,\r\nlaughingly, “I am come to take care of you.” The two watched the rush\r\nof the stormers up the breach, and listened to the sound of the fierce\r\ntumult within the walls. Presently, arm-in-arm, they quietly climbed\r\nthe breach, and found the last embers of the conflict still spluttering\r\nwithin. Napier was called away by some duty and Hodson went forward\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the mosque ran a narrow lane, bordered by rooms in which\r\nmany of the flying Sepoys had found shelter. Forbes-Mitchell says they\r\nhad broken open the door of one of these rooms, and saw it was crowded\r\nwith Sepoys. He placed some of his party on each side of the door, and\r\nsent back two men to the breach to get a few bags of gunpowder, with slow\r\nmatches fixed, intending to light one of these and fling it into the\r\nroom, by way of summarily clearing out the Sepoys. At that moment Hodson\r\ncame quickly up, sword in hand. “Where are the rebels?” he demanded\r\ngrimly. Forbes-Mitchell’s narrative runs: “I pointed to the door of the\r\nroom, and Hodson, shouting, ‘Come on,’ was about to rush in. I implored\r\nhim not to do so, saying ‘It’s certain death; wait for the powder; I’ve\r\nsent men for powder-bags.’ Hodson made a step forward, and I put out my\r\nhand to seize him by the shoulder to pull him out of the line of the\r\ndoorway, when he fell back, shot through the chest. He gasped out a few\r\nwords, either, ‘Oh, my wife,’ or ‘Oh, my mother’—I cannot now rightly\r\nremember—but was immediately choked by blood.”\r\n\r\nColonel Gordon-Alexander, who took part in the assault, and saw Hodson\r\ncome on the scene, gives a similar account of the manner in which\r\nHodson received his wound; but it illustrates the unreliability of\r\nhuman testimony to notice how he and Forbes-Mitchell, who were both\r\nactors in the tragedy, flatly contradict each other from this point.\r\nGordon-Alexander says that a man of his company, whom he had sent over\r\nto warn Hodson, “never stopped, but ran in at the door and pinned the\r\nman who had shot Hodson, with his bayonet, before he had time to reload.\r\nThere was only one other Sepoy in the doorway, and he was bayoneted,\r\ntoo.” Forbes-Mitchell says that after Hodson had been carried off, the\r\nbags of powder, with slow matches in them, were brought up. “These we\r\nlit, and then pitched the bags in through the door. Two or three bags\r\nvery soon brought the enemy out, and they were bayoneted. One of the\r\n93rd, a man named Rule, rushed in among the rebels, using both bayonet\r\nand butt of his rifle, shouting, ‘Revenge for Hodson!’ and he killed more\r\nthan half the men single-handed.” But, according to Gordon-Alexander,\r\nthere were only two Sepoys in the room, and no powder-bags were necessary\r\nto drive them out!\r\n\r\nHodson was a soldier of real genius, but was pursued through life, and\r\nto his very grave, by a swarm of baseless calumnies. When he was buried,\r\nColin Campbell himself stood by the grave, and, as the coffin of the dead\r\nsoldier sank from sight, the British commander-in-chief burst into tears.\r\nThose tears, rolling down the cheeks of so great and fine a soldier, are\r\nHodson’s best vindication and memorial.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, some other formidable buildings—the Secundrabagh, the Shah\r\nNujeef, &c.—had fallen, almost without resistance, into the hands of\r\nthe British. Outram was steadily pushing on along the northern bank,\r\nand scourging with his flank fire each position the Sepoys held. The\r\n12th and the 13th were employed by the engineers in pushing on a line of\r\nadvance through the houses, to the left of the main road, thus avoiding\r\nthe fire of the Sepoys. On the morning of the 14th the Imambarah, a mass\r\nof minarets, flat roofs, and long, ornamental frontage, was stormed by\r\nBrasyer’s Sikhs. Outram, by this time, had seized the iron bridge to\r\nthe west of the Residency. He was in a position to cork the neck of the\r\nbottle, that is, and to make flight impossible for the great mass of the\r\nSepoys. But this splendid position was thrown away by the first of the\r\ntwo great blunders which mar Colin Campbell’s conduct of the siege.\r\n\r\nOutram asked permission to force the bridge, and take the Sepoys,\r\nstill holding the Kaisarbagh and the Residency, in the rear. Campbell\r\nconsented, but forbade him crossing, if, in the process, he would lose a\r\nsingle man. Now, the bridge was held in force by the Sepoys, and guarded\r\nby a battery, and to force it would necessarily risk many lives. But war\r\nis a business of risks, and the gain beyond was enormous. A soldier like\r\nNicholson, or Neill, or Hodson, would have interpreted Campbell’s order\r\ngenerously; or they would have stormed the bridge without orders, and\r\nwould have trusted to the justification which success always gives. But\r\nOutram was of a less audacious type. An order, to him, was _sacro-sanct_.\r\nHe made no attempt to cross the bridge, but looked on, while the defeated\r\nSepoys streamed past in thousands, escaping to the open country, there to\r\nkindle the fires of a costly guerilla warfare.\r\n\r\nThe preparations to pass the bridge, it may be added, were marked by\r\nfine valour on the part of one of Outram’s engineers. Outram himself\r\nhad, at the beginning of the operations, thrown a barricade across the\r\nbridge, to prevent the Sepoys crossing. When, in turn, he himself had to\r\nforce his way across, it was necessary to remove this barricade, and to\r\ndo it in broad daylight, and under a fierce and sustained fire from the\r\nSepoys. Wynne, of the Engineers, and a sergeant named Paul, undertook the\r\nperilous task. They crept forward, crouching under the parapet of the\r\nbridge; then, kneeling down, they removed one sand-bag after another from\r\nthe barricade, passing each bag back along the line of men, from hand to\r\nhand. But, as the level of the barricade sank, the two gallant engineers\r\nwere exposed more fully to the Sepoy muskets. The fire was furious. Yet\r\nWynne and his companion coolly pulled down the barricade, bag by bag,\r\ntill the lowest tier was reached, and then ran back unharmed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, events elsewhere had moved too fast for the British\r\ncommander-in-chief. Brasyer’s Sikhs, with some companies of the 10th\r\nFoot, had stormed the Imambarah. The flying Sepoys took refuge in the\r\nnext and strongest of all the Sepoy works, the citadel of the whole\r\ndefence, the Kaisarbagh, a blaze of gilded spires, cupolas and domes,\r\nall turned into a vast fortification. The Sikhs and the 10th followed\r\nvehemently and closely, while some of the men of the 90th, led by young\r\nHavelock, carried a palace close to the Kaisarbagh, from which they\r\ncommanded three of its bastions. They opened on them a fire so deadly\r\nthat the Sepoys fled from their guns. The engineers wished to stay any\r\nfurther attack; the programme for the day was exhausted, and, in Colin\r\nCampbell’s leisurely tactics, nothing further was meant to be done that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBut the stormers were eager; Sikhs and Highlanders alike had the fire of\r\nvictory in their blood. They clambered through an embrasure, and forced\r\ntheir way into the Kaisarbagh, Havelock running back and bringing up some\r\ncompanies of the 10th Foot. Brasyer pushed out beyond the Kaisarbagh,\r\nindeed, to the Mess-house. Franks and Napier brought up new troops, and\r\nthe Kaisarbagh itself was swept from end to end.\r\n\r\nAll the wealth of India seemed to have been gathered within that great\r\nmass of gilded walls, and all this was now given up to mad and wasteful\r\nplunder. The men, to use Russell’s phrase, were “drunk with plunder.”\r\nThey literally waded through court after court, piled high with\r\nembroidered cloths, gold and silver brocade, arms rough with jewels,\r\nshawls heavy with gold, banners, cloaks, pictures, vases. The men had the\r\nwealth of kings under their feet!\r\n\r\nIt was a day of great deeds. Two successive lines of defensive works,\r\nvast as railway embankments, garrisoned by an army, and backed by a great\r\ncitadel, had been carried in succession. And yet the chief military\r\ngain of this great feat was lost, owing to Colin Campbell’s absurd\r\norder, which held Outram back from carrying the iron bridge, and enabled\r\nthe flying Sepoys to escape in thousands, to relight the flame of war\r\nthroughout the whole of Oude.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to know that Colin Campbell was at first disgusted, rather\r\nthan delighted, with the daring rush which, with such indecent and\r\nunscientific haste, carried the Kaisarbagh. He is said, indeed, to have\r\nsent orders to Franks to evacuate the great post. Franks, however, was\r\nboth a fine soldier and a hot-blooded Irishman, and he declined, in the\r\nbluntest form of speech, to give up the great stronghold his men had\r\ncarried with a dash so brilliant.\r\n\r\nCampbell’s imagination, it seems, was haunted by the sense that each\r\nSepoy position, when it was carried, was an abandoned powder-magazine,\r\npacked thick with the possibilities of dreadful explosions. And facts\r\njustified that uncomfortable belief. The story of one such fatal\r\nexplosion may be briefly told. In the Jumma Musjid no less than nine\r\ncart-loads of gunpowder were discovered. The powder was packed in tin\r\ncases, and it was resolved to destroy it by flinging the cases down a\r\nwell. A line of men was formed, and the cases passed quickly from hand to\r\nhand. The first case flung down struck against the side of the well, and\r\nexploded. The flame ran from case to case along the whole line till it\r\nreached the carts. The cases in the very hands of the men exploded, the\r\nnine cart-loads went off in one terrific blast of flame and sound, and,\r\nwith one exception, the whole party—numbering twenty-two men, with two\r\nengineer officers in command—was killed. The only man who escaped was the\r\none that threw that fatal first case down the well!\r\n\r\nWhen the Kaisarbagh and the Mess-house fell, and the third line of\r\nSepoy defences was thus carried, Lucknow was practically in the British\r\npower. But on the next day, March 15, Colin Campbell, wary and war-wise\r\nsoldier though he was, committed a second blunder, which helped to rob\r\nthe success of some of its best fruits. He realised the blunder he\r\ncommitted when he held back Outram, and to remedy it he perpetrated a\r\nfurther mistake. He despatched his two cavalry brigades in pursuit of\r\nthe flying Sepoys, and despatched them on the wrong roads. The absence\r\nof the cavalry created a huge gap in the British lines on the north of\r\nthe Goomtee, and a great body of Sepoys, said to be more than 20,000\r\nstrong, escaped through it unharmed. “In this way,” says Lord Roberts,\r\n“the campaign, which should then have come to an end, was protracted\r\nfor nearly a year by the fugitives spreading themselves over Oude, and\r\noccupying forts and other strong positions, from which they were able to\r\noffer resistance to our troops till the end of May 1859; thus causing\r\nneedless loss of thousands of British soldiers.” That is a severe\r\ncondemnation to be written by one great soldier on another.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Campbell, with a strong body of horse and guns, hovered outside\r\nthe Musabagh, ready to cut up the Sepoys when Outram had driven them out\r\nof that building. For some mysterious reason, and to the open disgust of\r\nthe whole British army, he failed to cut up the flying Sepoys. It was,\r\nfor his command, a day of inertness and failure; yet it was lit up by one\r\nsplendid dash of personal daring. A small mud fort covered, at one point,\r\nthe road along which the Sepoys were flying, and Campbell sent forward a\r\nparty of cavalry—a troop of the 7th Hussars and a squadron of Hodson’s\r\nHorse, with two guns—to clear the Sepoys out of it. The guns flung a\r\ncouple of shells over the walls of the fort, and it had the effect of a\r\nmatch flung into a beehive! The bees flew out, eager to sting! Some fifty\r\nrebels, headed by the village chief, a giant in size, suddenly rushed\r\nfrom the gate of the fort on the guns. They were upon the Hussars before\r\nthey could be put in motion to charge, and the three troop officers were\r\nin an instant struck down. A cluster of the Sepoys bent over one of the\r\nthree, Banks, slashing and thrusting at him, when Hegart, in command of\r\nthe Hussars, rode single-handed to his rescue.\r\n\r\nHe broke through the group, shooting right and left with his revolver,\r\nwheeled and dashed through them again. He had shot three, and knocked\r\nover a fourth with the hilt of his sword, when two Sikhs galloped up to\r\nhis aid, and Banks was saved, only to die of his wounds a few days later.\r\nWhen Hegart emerged from the fight everything he had about him, says Hope\r\nGrant, bore traces of his gallant struggle. His saddle and his horse were\r\nmarked with sword-slashes, his sword-hilt was dinted, his martingale was\r\ncut, the silk pocket handkerchief with which his sword was tied to his\r\nwrist was severed as cleanly as with a razor.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Lucknow, in a space of time so brief, and at a cost so\r\nslight, was due in part, of course, to the splendid leadership of the\r\nofficers and the daring of the men. But it was due, in even greater\r\nmeasure, to the skill of the engineers. It was an engineer’s plan that\r\nsent Outram, with his heavy guns, across the Goomtee, round the “toe” of\r\nthe boot, and so took the lines of the Sepoys in reverse. It was clever\r\nengineering, again, which broke a way for the advance of the British left\r\nwing through the houses to the left of the great road. The Sepoys had\r\ntaken it for granted that the advance of the British would be up that\r\nroad, and they had turned it into a Valley of Death. Every parapeted\r\nhousetop that looked down on the road was crowded with muskets. The road\r\nitself was merely a double line of crenellated walls, inaccessible to\r\nscaling ladders, swept by grape and case-shot from every cross street,\r\npelted by musketry from every mosque roof and palace gable, and raked\r\nfrom end to end with the fire of great guns. But all these elaborate\r\nand terrible defences were made useless by the fact that the British\r\nengineers tore a road for their advance through the houses to the left of\r\nthe great road, until the Kaisarbagh itself was reached and seized. The\r\nwhole siege, indeed, is a lesson in the value of science in war. Brains\r\ncount for more, in such a struggle, than even bullets.\r\n\r\nThe Residency itself fell with almost ludicrous tameness. Outram, on the\r\n16th, forced his way across the Iron Bridge, and the Residency, though\r\ncrowded with Sepoys, was yielded with scarcely a musket shot being fired\r\nin defence. The position which the Sepoys tried, in vain, for more than\r\neighty days to carry, was taken by the British in less than as many\r\nminutes!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of NORTHERN INDIA showing distribution of troops on\r\n1st. May 1857.\r\n\r\nBy permission, from Captain Trotter’s Life of John Nicholson, John Murray\r\n1898.\r\n\r\nWalker & Cockerell sc.]\r\n\r\nLucknow did not fall, however, without one eccentric and highly illogical\r\nflash of valour being shown by the Sepoys. The Moulvie of Fyzabad was\r\nthe most obstinate and daring of the leaders thrown up by the great\r\nMutiny. He was a soldier, indeed, who, on the Sepoys’ side, rivals Tantia\r\nTopee himself for generalship; while, for personal daring, he leaves the\r\nNana’s general hopelessly behind. The Moulvie had made his escape from\r\nLucknow, but in a mood of sudden wrath, turned his face towards the city\r\nagain. He returned, and occupied a strong building, from which he was\r\nonly expelled with much hard fighting by the 93rd and the 4th Punjaub\r\nInfantry. The fight was hopeless from the outset; the city had fallen,\r\nfurther resistance was a mere idle waste of life. Yet the Sepoys showed a\r\nmore desperate courage in this combat than at any other point throughout\r\nthe siege. For so much does the influence of one brave man count!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Major, 37 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  Adye, 247\r\n\r\n  Agra, 176\r\n\r\n  Aikman, Lieutenant, 331, 332\r\n\r\n  Aitken, Lieutenant, 163, 207, 234\r\n\r\n  Ajmeer Gate, Delhi, 317\r\n\r\n  Alexander, 66, 67\r\n\r\n  Alison, 241, 251, 254, 256\r\n\r\n  Allahabad, 108, 125, 254;\r\n    revolt, 65;\r\n    mutineers march to Delhi, 66;\r\n    treasury plundered, 69;\r\n    Neill arrives from Benares at, 70, 75;\r\n    retribution, 77\r\n\r\n  Alumbagh, 7, 236, 240;\r\n    storming of the, 194;\r\n    Outram holds the, 349, 350\r\n\r\n  Anderson, Captain, 164, 171\r\n\r\n  ⸺, Major, 182\r\n\r\n  Anson, General, 210, 272;\r\n    his death, 273\r\n\r\n  ⸺, Major, 236\r\n\r\n  Aong, village of, 130\r\n\r\n  Arnold, Captain, 200, 208\r\n\r\n  Arrah, 7\r\n\r\n  Arrapore, 126\r\n\r\n  Ashe, Lieutenant, 98 _et seq._, 118\r\n\r\n  Attock, river, 295\r\n\r\n  Azimoolah (Nana Sahib’s Prime Minister), 88\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bahadur, Jung, 350\r\n\r\n  Bailey Guard Gate, Lucknow, 162, 163, 185, 202, 204, 234\r\n\r\n  Balaclava, 317\r\n\r\n  Bala Rao (the Nana’s general), 138, 141\r\n\r\n  Banks, Major, 148;\r\n    succeeds Sir H.

Crown 8vo, 6_s._\r\n\r\n    _PUNCH._—‘My Baronite, having read all Dr. Fitchett’s tales\r\n    of battle on land, thinks his best piece is his sea piece....\r\n    Saxon and Celt reading the glowing narrative will feel proud to\r\n    know it’s all true.’\r\n\r\n    _ACADEMY._—‘A spirited picture of Nelson and his times.... The\r\n    story which the author has to tell is almost incredible in its\r\n    directness of detail, but certainly fascinating in its charm.’\r\n\r\n=The Tale of the Great Mutiny.= SECOND IMPRESSION. With 8 Portraits and 4\r\nPlans. Crown 8vo, 6_s._\r\n\r\n    _GUARDIAN._—‘It is almost impossible to lay the book down.\r\n    The Story of those summer months of 1857 must ever appeal to\r\n    English readers.’\r\n\r\n    _BOOKMAN._—‘Written with all the swing and dash, with all the\r\n    careful accuracy and brilliant descriptive power which have\r\n    made Dr. Fitchett’s books so deservedly popular.’\r\n\r\n=How England Saved Europe: the Story of the Great War (1793-1815).=\r\nSECOND IMPRESSION. In 4 vols., crown 8vo, with Portraits, Facsimiles, and\r\nPlans, 6_s._ each.\r\n\r\n    _TIMES._—‘The story is broadly told, but very vigorously. It\r\n    is not without significance that this excellent “Story of the\r\n    Great War,” at once popular in the best sense, well-informed,\r\n    full of instruction, and very attractively written, should be\r\n    the work of a Colonial writer.’\r\n\r\n    _GUARDIAN._—‘Mr. Fitchett has achieved a real success, and the\r\n    boy who cannot read these volumes with pleasure (and profit)\r\n    is hopeless. They are, if boyhood would but see it, more\r\n    enthralling than half the novels published.’\r\n\r\n=Fights for the Flag.= SECOND EDITION. With 16 Portraits, 13 Plans, and a\r\nFacsimile Letter of the Duke of Marlborough. Crown 8vo, 6_s._\r\n\r\n    _SPECTATOR._—‘“Fights for the Flag” is as good as “Deeds that\r\n    Won the Empire.” To say more than this in praise of the book\r\n    before us is unnecessary, for “Deeds that Won the Empire” was\r\n    one of the best collection of popular battle studies ever given\r\n    to the public.... No writer ever had more completely the art of\r\n    making one realise how opposing forces move both by land and\r\n    sea.’\r\n\r\n    _REVIEW OF REVIEWS._—‘This is the second volume of the series\r\n    which has achieved one of the greatest literary successes of\r\n    our time.... As a gift-book, or as a book to take up and read\r\n    at odd moments, or to devour at a prolonged sitting, this\r\n    book has few equals, and will probably equal or eclipse the\r\n    popularity of its predecessors.’\r\n\r\n=Deeds that Won the Empire.= FOURTEENTH EDITION. With 16 Portraits and 11\r\nPlans. Crown 8vo, 6_s._\r\n\r\n    _SPECTATOR._—‘Not since Macaulay ceased to write has English\r\n    literature produced a writer capable of infusing such life and\r\n    vigour into historical scenes. The wholesome and manly tone\r\n    of Mr. Fitchett’s book is specially satisfactory.... The book\r\n    cannot but take the reader by storm wherever it finds him.’\r\n\r\n    _TIMES._—‘“Deeds that Won the Empire” is admirably conceived\r\n    and written. Wolfe’s striking feat of arms at Quebec, Hawke’s\r\n    splendid victory in Quiberon Bay, Busaco, Albuera, the Nile,\r\n    the action of the _Shannon_ and _Chesapeake_, with other\r\n    memorable fights by sea and land, are vividly described. Mr.\r\n    Fitchett has not sacrificed historical accuracy to dramatic\r\n    effect, and his words ring true.’\r\n\r\n=Wellington’s Men: some Soldier-Autobiographies.= (‘Kincaid’s Adventures\r\nin the Rifle Brigade’; ‘Rifleman Harris’; Anton’s ‘Military Life’;\r\nMercer’s ‘Waterloo.’) Edited by W. H. FITCHETT, M.A., LL.D. Crown 8vo,\r\n6_s._\r\n\r\n    _SPECTATOR._—‘Fitchett has ere this sounded the clarion and\r\n    filled the fife to good purpose, but he has never done better\r\n    work than in rescuing from oblivion the narratives which appear\r\n    in this volume. Here we have the incidents of war told by the\r\n    actors themselves, and each actor saw a different side of\r\n    the thing, and had his own way of telling about it. We feel\r\n    very grateful to Mr. Fitchett for his skilful editing of four\r\n    stories which ought not to be allowed to die.’\r\n\r\nLondon: SMITH, ELDER, & CO., 15 Waterloo Place, S.

W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS BY FRANK T. BULLEN, F.R.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Deep Sea Plunderings.= THIRD IMPRESSION. With 8 Full-page Illustrations\r\nby ARTHUR TWIDLE. Crown 8vo, 6s.\r\n\r\n    _SPECTATOR._—“A new book of sea stories from Mr. Bullen is an\r\n    event which all who enjoy an exciting narrative set forth in a\r\n    picturesque and animated manner have good reason to be thankful\r\n    for.... There is something in the book to please almost every\r\n    taste, and very little to call for serious criticism.... The\r\n    book deserves to be, and will be, read by all who look to\r\n    literature to provide them with refreshment and recreation.”\r\n\r\n    _TIMES._—“Mr. Bullen’s name is sufficient recommendation for a\r\n    collection of most miscellaneous stories, all smacking strongly\r\n    of the brine. In ‘Deep Sea Plunderings’ be does exciting\r\n    and informing work, and in the depths of the ocean finds\r\n    inexhaustible treasure.”\r\n\r\n=The Men of the Merchant Service.= Being the Polity of the Mercantile\r\nMarine for ‘Longshore Readers.’ SECOND IMPRESSION. Large post 8vo, 7s. 6d.\r\n\r\n    _SPECTATOR._—“The book is of great value, and of great interest\r\n    to all the innumerable people who are curious about the most\r\n    romantic and separate of lives. But it is of importance,\r\n    secondly and chiefly, as Mr. Bullen’s appeal to the political\r\n    sense of his country. Put as briefly as possible, it comes\r\n    to this. The control of the sea is vital to England; and\r\n    the English, though they continue to be a great ship-owning\r\n    people, are less and less a seafaring people. English ships\r\n    are increasingly manned by foreigners and officered by\r\n    foreigners. We cannot commend his volume too earnestly to\r\n    public consideration. England’s tenure of her position in the\r\n    world depends on her merchant marine no less than on her Navy,\r\n    and in neither one nor the other can she afford to rely on\r\n    mercenaries.”\r\n\r\n    _ACADEMY._—“We could not in a short space convey any idea\r\n    of the variety of special information—all so human and\r\n    related-that Mr. Bullen gives.... We only prick a book that is\r\n    bulged with seacraft, and resembles the perfect sailor whose\r\n    every hair is a ropeyarn and every drop of blood Stockholm tar.”\r\n\r\n=The Cruise of the “Cachalot” Round the World After Sperm Whales.= By\r\nFRANK T. BULLEN, First Mate. The volume includes a Letter to the Author\r\nfrom RUDYARD KIPLING. NINTH IMPRESSION. With 8 Illustrations and a Chart.\r\nLarge post 8vo, 8s. 6d.\r\n\r\n    _TIMES._—“Mr. Bullen has a splendid subject, and be handles it\r\n    with the pen of a master.... ‘The Cruise of the _Cachalot_’ is\r\n    a book which cannot but fascinate all lovers of the sea, and\r\n    all who can appreciate a masterly presentation of its wonder\r\n    and its mystery, its terrors and its trials, its humours and\r\n    its tragedies.”\r\n\r\n    _The Rev. Dr. HORTON, in his Sermon on behalf of the British\r\n    and Foreign Bible Society, referred to Mr. Bullen’s ‘Cruise of\r\n    the Cachalot’ in the following terms_:\r\n\r\n    “It is a very remarkable book in every way: it seems to\r\n    me worthy to rank with some of the writings of Defoe. It\r\n    has absolutely taken the shine out of some of the romantic\r\n    literature of such writers as even Stevenson and Rudyard\r\n    Kipling. By the strange law that truth is more wonderful than\r\n    fiction, this book is more wonderful than the wildest dreams of\r\n    the creator of imagination.”\r\n\r\n=The Log of a Sea-Waif.= Being Recollections of the First Four Years of\r\nmy Sea Life. THIRD IMPRESSION. With 8 Full-page Illustrations specially\r\ndrawn by ARTHUR TWIDLE. Large post 8vo, 8s. 6d.\r\n\r\n    _WORLD._—“We have read many stories of sea life, but do not\r\n    remember to have been so fascinated and enthralled by any\r\n    of them as by this masterly presentation of the humours,\r\n    hardships, and minor tragedies of life in the forecastle.”\r\n\r\n    _TIMES._—“Full of thrilling adventure, admirably told.... We\r\n    must leave Mr. Bullen’s touching story of his early struggles\r\n    and adventures to speak for itself. His descriptive powers are\r\n    great, his literary imagination is vivid, and he finds abundant\r\n    opportunities for the display of both.”\r\n\r\nLONDON: SMITH, ELDER, & CO., 15 WATERLOO PLACE, S. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALL MALL GAZETTE.—“When the Haworth Edition was announced we expected\r\nsomething with which no other version has provided us, and we are not\r\ndisappointed.”\r\n\r\nIn 7 Volumes. Large crown 8vo, cloth, gilt top, 6s. each.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAWORTH EDITION OF THE LIFE AND WORKS OF CHARLOTTE BRONTË (CURRER\r\nBELL) AND HER SISTERS EMILY AND ANNE BRONTË (ELLIS AND ACTON BELL)\r\n\r\n_WITH PORTRAITS AND ILLUSTRATIONS_.\r\n\r\nIncluding Views of places described in the Works, reproduced from\r\nPhotographs specially taken for the purpose by Mr. W.

Volumes 22 to 26 edited\r\nby LESLIE STEPHEN and SIDNEY LEE. Volumes 27 to 63, and the three\r\nSupplementary Volumes, edited by SIDNEY LEE.)\r\n\r\n    A FEW REPRESENTATIVE OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n    _TIMES._—‘ONE OF THE MOST ENDURING AND ONE OF THE MOST\r\n    IMPORTANT LITERARY MONUMENTS OF THE TIME IN WHICH WE LIVE.\r\n    Indeed, it is no hyperbole to say that the Dictionary is much\r\n    more than this. In many respects it is unique—in its immense\r\n    bulk and scope, in the high standard of excellence it maintains\r\n    throughout, in the literary eminence and scholarly reputation\r\n    of so many of its contributors, in the amazing regularity of\r\n    its appearance from first to last.’\r\n\r\n    _SPECTATOR._—‘A WORK OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE. It will by degrees\r\n    and in course of years correct a great national fault—the\r\n    tendency to forget men who are worthy of remembrance.... No\r\n    statue will recall an eminent individual as this Dictionary\r\n    of Biography will recall them all. It is more than a great\r\n    monument to the eminent, for it is also what a monument can\r\n    seldom be—a record of their deeds. As a whole the work, which\r\n    involved an infinity of labour, much judgment, and some shrewd\r\n    insight into character, has been marvellously well done, so\r\n    that the great book will probably never be superseded, and will\r\n    possibly for centuries give the first impress to the judgment\r\n    of the inquirer into the history and doings of all English\r\n    notables.’\r\n\r\n    _LITERATURE._—‘The inception of the work, its steady and\r\n    business-like execution, and its reception by the public mark\r\n    something like AN EPOCH IN ENGLISH LITERARY HISTORY. Few\r\n    publications even in an age when collaboration is the fashion,\r\n    have brought together so many distinguished writers; none\r\n    certainly have done more to organise research and turn it to a\r\n    practical use.’\r\n\r\n    _EDINBURGH REVIEW._—‘A Dictionary of Biography on this scale\r\n    is A HISTORY OF OUR RACE. The biographies of sovereigns, and\r\n    statesmen, and warriors, written as they are in these volumes\r\n    with great fulness, do in fact contain the annals of their\r\n    lives. There is not in existence a more complete history of\r\n    England than is to be found in these volumes.’\r\n\r\n    _ATHENÆUM._—‘IN FULNESS, IN THOROUGHNESS, AND IN GENERAL\r\n    ACCURACY IT LEAVES LITTLE OR NOTHING TO BE DESIRED. It compares\r\n    very favourably with its two foreign models in most essential\r\n    points; and in one, at least, it is distinctly superior.\r\n    Neither the German nor the Belgian Dictionary indicates the\r\n    sources from which the matter in the text has been drawn with\r\n    equal completeness and precision. A careful bibliographical\r\n    note is appended to even the shortest of the articles; and in\r\n    some of the longer ones this note becomes nothing less than an\r\n    exhaustive critical digest, the utility of which can scarcely\r\n    be rated too highly.’\r\n\r\n    _DAILY TELEGRAPH._—‘A GREAT UNDERTAKING, WORTHILY DESIGNED, AND\r\n    ADMIRABLY EXECUTED.... We may at least say that the “Dictionary\r\n    of National Biography” has achieved in many respects the ideal\r\n    which was before the mind of Plutarch when he wrote his “Lives\r\n    of Greeks and Romans” at once to amuse and interest himself and\r\n    to edify and enlighten the world.’\r\n\r\n    _MORNING POST._—‘THE GREATEST UNDERTAKING OF THE CENTURY IN\r\n    ITS OWN FIELD OF ENDEAVOUR.... It must justly be said that\r\n    this vast undertaking will fill a yawning gap in the list of\r\n    dictionaries, and satisfy a want which must have been felt,\r\n    more or less strongly, by almost every English writer.’\r\n\r\n    _ENGLISH HISTORICAL REVIEW._—‘The thoroughness of the work\r\n    is such that the Dictionary has become AN INDISPENSABLE BOOK\r\n    OF REFERENCE, and its influence will be strongly felt on the\r\n    scholarship of the next generation.’\r\n\r\n    _SPEAKER._—‘The book WILL LAST AS LONG AS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE,\r\n    and will preserve for all time not only the memory of the\r\n    greater personages of English history, which is in no danger,\r\n    but of that multitude of smaller luminaries whose light would\r\n    otherwise have been lost.’\r\n\r\n_A Full Prospectus of ‘The Dictionary of National Biography,’ with\r\nSpecimen Pages, may be had upon application._\r\n\r\nLondon: SMITH, ELDER, & CO., 15 Waterloo Place, S.
