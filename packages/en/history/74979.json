It is a work\r\nworthy of the sympathy and aid of every American who can rise above the\r\nenvironment of today and look into the broad future. Fidelity, truth,\r\nhonor are the watchwords of such a purpose, and under their noble\r\ninfluences should our work be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE II.\r\n                         OBJECTS AND PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe objects and purposes of this Society are:\r\n\r\n(1) The study of American history generally.\r\n\r\n(2) To investigate, especially, the immigration of the people of Ireland\r\nto this country, determine its numbers, examine the sources, learn the\r\nplaces of its settlement, and estimate its influence on contemporary\r\nevents in war, legislation, religion, education and other departments of\r\nhuman activity.\r\n\r\n(3) To examine records of every character, wherever found, calculated to\r\nthrow light on the work of the Irish element in this broad land.\r\n\r\n(4) To endeavor to correct erroneous, distorted and false views of\r\nhistory, where they are known, and to substitute therefor the truth of\r\nhistory, based on documentary evidence and the best and most reasonable\r\ntradition, in relation to the Irish race in America.\r\n\r\n(5) To encourage and assist the formation of local societies in American\r\ncities and towns for the work of the parent society.\r\n\r\n(6) To promote and foster an honorable and national spirit of\r\npatriotism, which will know no lines of division, which will be based\r\nupon loyalty to the laws, institutions and spirit of the republic to\r\nwhose upbuilding the Irish element has unselfishly contributed in blood\r\nand treasure, a patriotism whose simple watchwords will be true\r\nAmericanism and human freedom and which has no concern for any man’s\r\nrace, color or creed, measuring him only by his conduct, effort and\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n(7) To promote by union in a common high purpose a sincere fraternity, a\r\ngreater emulation in well doing, a closer confidence and mutual respect\r\namong the various elements of the Irish race in America, that by putting\r\nbehind them the asperities of the past they may unite in a common\r\nbrotherhood with their fellow citizens for the honor of the race and the\r\nglory of the republic.\r\n\r\n(8) To place the result of its historical investigations and researches\r\nin acceptable literary form; to print, publish and distribute its\r\ndocuments to libraries, institutions of learning, and among its members,\r\nin order that the widest dissemination of historical truth may be\r\nobtained and placed within the reach of historians and other writers and\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n(9) To sift and discriminate every paper, sketch, document bearing on\r\nthe Society’s line of work before the same is accepted and given\r\nofficial sanction in order that its publication may be a guarantee of\r\nhistorical accuracy; to do its work without passion or prejudice, to\r\nview accomplished facts in the true scientific historical spirit and\r\nhaving reached the truth to give it to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE III.\r\n                              MEMBERSHIP.\r\n\r\nAny person of good moral character who is interested in the special work\r\nof this Society shall be deemed eligible for membership in the same.

As the report of this committee has not yet been\r\nadopted, the foregoing Constitution is still in force.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThe Society was organized on January 20, 1897, in Boston, Mass., and now\r\nhas members in nearly all the states, the District of Columbia, one\r\nterritory and four foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe object of the organization is to make better known the Irish chapter\r\nin American history.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of members—Life and Annual. The life membership\r\nfee is $50 (paid once). The fee for annual members is $5, paid yearly.\r\nIn the case of new annual members, the initiation fee, $5, also pays the\r\nmembership dues for the first year.\r\n\r\nThe government comprises a President-General, a Vice-President-General,\r\na Secretary-General, a Treasurer-General, a Librarian and Archivist, a\r\nHistoriographer and an Executive Council. There are also State\r\nVice-Presidents.\r\n\r\nThe Society has already issued several bound volumes and a number of\r\nother publications. These have been distributed to members, public\r\nlibraries, historical organizations and universities. Each member of the\r\nSociety is entitled, free of charge, to a copy of every publication\r\nissued from the time of his admittance. These publications are of great\r\ninterest and value, and are more than an equivalent for the membership\r\nfee.\r\n\r\nThe Society draws no lines of creed or politics. Being an American\r\norganization in spirit and principle, it welcomes to its ranks Americans\r\nof whatever race or descent, and of whatever creed, who take an interest\r\nin the objects for which the Society is organized. Membership\r\napplication blanks will be furnished on request to the Secretary-General\r\nat his office, 49 Westminster Street, Providence, R. I., or to John J.\r\nLenehan, Chairman of the Committee on Membership, 71 Nassau Street, New\r\nYork City. Blank applications found at the end of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe membership includes many people of prominence and occupies a\r\nposition in the front rank of American historical organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Society is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State\r\nof Rhode Island and is authorized to take, hold and convey real and\r\npersonal estate to the amount of $100,000.\r\n\r\nGifts or bequests of money for the uses of the Society are solicited. We\r\ndepend entirely on our membership fees and dues, and if we had a\r\nsuitable fund on hand its income would be most advantageously used for\r\nhistorical research, printing and issuing historical works and papers\r\nand adding to our library.

D., New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORDS OF THE TWELFTH ANNUAL MEETING AND BANQUET OF THE AMERICAN IRISH\r\n HISTORICAL SOCIETY AT THE HOTEL PLAZA, NEW YORK CITY, JANUARY 8, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt having been voted at the Eleventh Annual Meeting in Washington to\r\nhold the next annual meeting in New York, the Executive Council\r\nconsidered the necessary arrangements and resolved to make the Twelfth\r\nAnnual Meeting and Banquet the most notable in the Society’s history.\r\n\r\nHeretofore it had been the custom to hold the meeting and banquet of the\r\nSociety the same evening, commencing at six o’clock and ending toward\r\nmidnight. This gave little opportunity for a discussion of the papers\r\npresented, and many members who had been invited at these previous\r\nmeetings to prepare papers were obliged to submit them to the\r\nSecretary-General without reading, with the result that the other\r\nmembers obtained information as to the contents of these only after they\r\nwere printed in the volume of the Journal issued next succeeding the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nThe President-General appointed the following gentlemen a Dinner\r\nCommittee, to arrange the details of the meeting and dinner:\r\n\r\nMr. Stephen J. Farrelly, Chairman; and Messrs. Joseph I. C. Clarke, John\r\nD. Crimmins, Edmond J. Curry, Victor Herbert, John J. Lenehan and Joseph\r\nT. Ryan.\r\n\r\nAfter negotiations with the various high-class hostelries in New York\r\nand exhibiting a desire to procure for the use of the Society the best\r\naccommodations to be found in New York, the Dinner Committee finally\r\ndecided upon the Hotel Plaza as the place and arranged for the business\r\nmeeting of the Society to commence at two o’clock in the afternoon and\r\nterminate at six, and the dinner to begin at seven o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe following circular was issued and sent to each member of the\r\nSociety, containing the arrangements for the meeting:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n  ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING AND TWELFTH ANNUAL DINNER OF THE\r\n                                SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Twelfth Annual Meeting of the American Irish Historical Society\r\n  will take place at the Hotel Plaza, New York City, Saturday, January\r\n  8, 1910, commencing at two o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n  It has been the custom at previous meetings of the Society to assemble\r\n  at six o’clock, hold a short business meeting, followed by a dinner\r\n  commencing at seven o’clock, at the conclusion of which historical\r\n  papers would be read.\r\n\r\n  It has been found difficult to properly appreciate the learning and\r\n  research shown by the eminent authors of historical papers in the\r\n  meagre time between the termination of a good dinner and the hour when\r\n  the meeting should end, and this year the Executive Council has made a\r\n  new departure in this regard, which it is earnestly hoped will meet\r\n  with the approval of our members.\r\n\r\n  The meeting of the Society will be called to order at two o’clock in\r\n  the afternoon in the New Banquet Room on the first floor of the Hotel\r\n  Plaza by the President-General. The first business will be the\r\n  presentation of reports of the President-General, Treasurer-General,\r\n  and Secretary-General, followed by the election of General Officers,\r\n  Executive Council and State Vice-Presidents for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n  The Executive Council, at a meeting held in New York, November 12,\r\n  1909, nominated a board of officers to be voted upon at this meeting,\r\n  the names of whom appear elsewhere in this circular.\r\n\r\n  The report of the Secretary-General will contain the statistics of the\r\n  Society, the list of new members, names of those dropped for\r\n  non-payment of dues, synopsis of the work the Society has done during\r\n  the past year, and other interesting information.\r\n\r\n  It is expected that the business of the Society and the presentation\r\n  of scientific papers will all be completed at an hour which will give\r\n  members ample time to dress for dinner.\r\n\r\n  The Meeting Room will be open at 12.30 o’clock, and members on their\r\n  arrival are requested to register themselves and their guests.\r\n\r\n  The annual dinner will take place in the Grand Ball Room promptly at\r\n  seven o’clock, and the Dinner Committee are informed that the\r\n  management of the hotel plan to give us a most enjoyable dinner and\r\n  extend us every possible courtesy.\r\n\r\n  The Executive Council, following the departure inaugurated at the\r\n  Eleventh Annual Meeting in Washington, D. C., January 16, 1909, have\r\n  voted that members may invite ladies and gentlemen as guests.\r\n\r\n  The price of the dinner tickets is $5.00 each, and it is advisable to\r\n  promptly send applications, accompanied by cheque to the\r\n  Secretary-General, who is Secretary of the Dinner Committee; so that\r\n  seats may be allotted. Allotments will be made in the order in which\r\n  applications are received, and parties of six or more, desiring to be\r\n  seated together, can be accommodated by making that fact known when\r\n  the tickets are purchased.\r\n\r\n  Among those who will furnish scientific papers during the afternoon\r\n  session will be Hon. Joseph F. O’Connell, Hon. Henry Groves Connor,\r\n  John Louis Sheehan, LL. D., Hon. James Fitzgerald, M. X. Sullivan, Ph.\r\n  D., Joseph I. C. Clarke, Esq., and Alfred J. Talley, Esq., Judge\r\n  Joseph T. Lawless, and others.\r\n\r\n  The speakers at the dinner will be Hon. Michael F. Dooley, Hon.\r\n  William McAdoo, Rev. J. Havergal Sheppard, D. D., Hon. William A.\r\n  Prendergast, Hon. Joseph H. O’Neil, Hon. John W. Goff, Hon. Alexander\r\n  C. Eustace and others.\r\n\r\n  Souvenirs of the occasion containing the seal of the Society, menu,\r\n  list of speakers, officers and other detailed information, have been\r\n  prepared, after competitive bidding, by the Gorham Manufacturing\r\n  Company. These are very beautiful and artistic and will be distributed\r\n  among members and guests at the dinner.\r\n\r\n  The committee of the Society having the dinner in charge is as\r\n  follows:—Stephen Farrelly, Esq., Joseph T. Ryan, Esq., John J.\r\n  Lenehan, Esq., Joseph I. C. Clarke, Esq., Hon. John D. Crimmins,\r\n  Edmond J. Curry, Esq., Victor Herbert, Esq., and Hon. Edward J.\r\n  McGuire, President-General Quinlan and the Secretary-General ex\r\n  officio.\r\n\r\n  As the seating capacity of the Grand Ball Room of the Plaza is limited\r\n  to 425, it is earnestly desired that members make applications for\r\n  dinner tickets at once, in order that the Committee may complete\r\n  arrangements as early as possible and bring about a pleasant reunion\r\n  of our members and their guests.\r\n\r\n                     Yours fraternally,\r\n                         FRANCIS J.

I.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little later an additional circular letter was issued and sent to each\r\nof the members, giving additional information about the meeting and\r\ndinner that was sought for by quite a few:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n TWELFTH ANNUAL MEETING AND DINNER AT HOTEL PLAZA, NEW YORK CITY, JANUARY\r\n                                 8, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Dinner Committee are greatly pleased with the prompt purchase of\r\n  tickets by so many members of the Society, and the absolute success of\r\n  the Twelfth Annual Banquet is now an assured fact.\r\n\r\n  The President-General and the Executive Council respectfully request\r\n  that those who intend to be present at the dinner, but have not yet\r\n  taken tickets or ordered seats for themselves or guests, will do so at\r\n  the earliest possible moment so that seats may be provided and their\r\n  comfort looked after. The tickets are five dollars each, and may be\r\n  had upon application to the Secretary-General, accompanied by check.\r\n  Members may invite guests, ladies or gentlemen.\r\n\r\n  The business meeting will be called to order promptly at two o’clock\r\n  p. m. in the New Banquet Room on the first floor of the Hotel Plaza.\r\n\r\n  Scientific papers will be presented by the following members: HON.\r\n  JOSEPH F. O’CONNELL, HON. HENRY GROVES CONNOR, JOHN LOUIS SHEEHAN, LL.\r\n  D., HON. JAMES FITZGERALD, M. X. SULLIVAN, PH. D., JOSEPH I. C.\r\n  CLARKE, ESQ., ALFRED J. TALLEY, ESQ., and others.\r\n\r\n  The speakers at the dinner will be: HON. MICHAEL F. DOOLEY, HON.\r\n  WILLIAM MCADOO, REV. J. HAVERGAL SHEPPARD, D. D., COL. CHARLES\r\n  ALEXANDER, HON. WILLIAM A. PENDERGAST, HON. JOHN W. GOFF, EDWARD M.\r\n  TIERNEY, ESQ., and others.\r\n\r\n  The Secretary-General will be in attendance at the Society’s\r\n  headquarters at The Plaza after 9 a. m., the day of the meeting and\r\n  banquet, and will have on sale tickets for those who up to that time\r\n  have not been provided with them. The seats, however, will not be as\r\n  desirable for those who wait until the day of the banquet to get their\r\n  tickets, but there are plenty of desirable places remaining unsold.\r\n\r\n  The attendance of every member who can possibly be present is strongly\r\n  urged, with the hope of making this meeting and banquet the greatest\r\n  the Society has ever held. The Hotel Plaza is the most desirable place\r\n  for a banquet in New York, and was selected by the Dinner Committee\r\n  with the sole idea of having the best obtainable for our Society.\r\n\r\n  The management has given the members the benefit of a low rate for\r\n  accommodations, and authorizes the following quotations to our members\r\n  and guests:\r\n\r\n  Single rooms with bath for one person $4.00, $5.00 and $6.00 per day,\r\n  according to location.\r\n\r\n  Double rooms with bath for two persons $6.00, $7.00 and $8.00 per day,\r\n  according to location.\r\n\r\n  Dinner at seven o’clock in the Grand Ball Room. An exquisite souvenir\r\n  designed by the Dinner Committee and executed by Gorham Company,\r\n  containing program, songs and useful information about the Society,\r\n  will be presented each member and guest in attendance at the dinner.\r\n\r\n                        FRANCIS J. QUINLAN, M. D., LL. D.,\r\n                                            _President-General_,\r\n                            33 West Thirty-Eighth Street, New York City.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS ZANSLAUR LEE,\r\n      _Secretary-General_,\r\n          49 Westminster Street, Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the business meeting the assembly room was cleared\r\nand properly arranged for a reception to the members of the Society, to\r\nbe given by the officers. This function was well attended, and the large\r\nassembly hall was filled to overflowing with members and their lady and\r\ngentlemen guests.\r\n\r\nThe programme of the evening was executed by the Gorham Manufacturing\r\nCompany from designs and suggestions furnished by the New York members\r\nof the Dinner Committee, and is considered the most artistic programme\r\never used at a similar function in New York.\r\n\r\nThe menu of the dinner, which was served under the personal direction of\r\nMr. C. E. Railing, the manager of the Plaza, was as follows:\r\n\r\n                             Hors D’Oeuvre\r\n\r\n                                  ————\r\n\r\n                           Consomme Beatrice\r\n\r\n                                                      Sherry\r\n\r\n                                  ————\r\n\r\n                       Supreme de Sole a la Russe\r\n\r\n                                                    Sauterne\r\n\r\n                         Filets de Boeuf Pique\r\n                           Garni Bouquetiere\r\n                            Pommes Fondantes\r\n\r\n                                                     Margaux\r\n\r\n                                  ————\r\n\r\n                          Sorbet au Marasquin.\r\n\r\n                                  ————\r\n\r\n                          Poularde a la Broche\r\n                                 Salade\r\n\r\n                                  ————\r\n\r\n                             Bombe Surprise\r\n                              Petits Fours\r\n\r\n                                  ————\r\n\r\n                                  Cafe\r\n\r\n            White Rock       Fonseca Cigars       Cigarettes\r\n\r\nThis banquet was served in the principal dining hall of the Hotel Plaza,\r\nwhich, on account of the great number of tickets sold, was crowded to\r\nthe doors with members of the Society and guests.\r\n\r\nPresident-General Francis J. Quinlan presided at the meeting and later\r\nat the banquet, and divine grace was asked at the latter by Right\r\nReverend James A. McFaul, D. D., Bishop of Trenton.\r\n\r\nThe Society acknowledges the many courtesies extended to it by the\r\nmanagement of the Hotel Plaza and the earnest effort to do everything\r\npossible for our pleasure and comfort, and the painstaking efforts and\r\nexcellent direction of Mr. C. E. Railing, in immediate charge in behalf\r\nof the Hotel Plaza of our arrangements, are gratefully appreciated by\r\nthe Society.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the twelfth annual meeting and banquet of the Society\r\nwere stenographically reported by Miss Viola Follis of Providence, R.\r\nI., whose faithful and accurate transcription of last year’s proceedings\r\nwon so much favor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MINUTES OF THE ANNUAL MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was voted that the reading of the minutes of the Eleventh Annual\r\nMeeting be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe admission of new members being the first business in order, the\r\nfollowing list of applicants was read by the Secretary-General, all of\r\nwhom, by unanimous vote, were duly elected:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LIFE MEMBERS.\r\n\r\nJames Butler, Esq., 230 West 72d Street, New York City.

Proposed by\r\nWilliam H. Delany.\r\n\r\nDesmond FitzGerald, Esq., Brookline, Mass. Proposed by John J. Lenehan.\r\n\r\nThe President-General, at this point, made a most interesting and\r\ninstructive address upon the work of the Society, pointing out what had\r\nbeen accomplished during the past twelve months and indicating what its\r\ngeneral policy would be for the future. A review was made of the work of\r\nthe different officers of the Society, and recommendations of an\r\nappropriate and timely nature were presented. Unfortunately, the text of\r\nthe President-General’s remarks cannot be given as the stenographic\r\nclerk was temporarily absent.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary-General presented and read the following report, which, by\r\nunanimous vote, was accepted and placed on file:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nIt is with much pleasure I present the report of my office for 1909,\r\nwhich has been to the Society a year of success, prosperity and great\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of my term of office as Acting Secretary-General in\r\nSeptember, 1908, there were 538 members enrolled on the books. Many of\r\nthese had not paid dues for a number of years, and had lost all interest\r\nin the Society and its objects, while others had deceased and no record\r\nhad been kept of them because word had not been communicated to the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\n\r\nA general house-cleaning took place, and a list of members in arrears\r\nfor two years and more was prepared and submitted to the Executive\r\nCouncil, which ordered extra notices sent to every delinquent in order\r\nthat each member in arrears might know the extent of his obligations.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Delinquent Members appointed January 16th, 1909, sent\r\nout printed notices, through this office, urging the necessity of prompt\r\npayment of dues, and in short every reasonable means to stimulate\r\npayment and activity was taken. Some responded, but the majority did not\r\nand their names have been stricken from the roll of the Society.\r\n\r\nJanuary 16th, 1909, the date of the last annual meeting, the Society had\r\n687 members, 149 applicants having been admitted since September, 1908.\r\nDuring the year 1909, 239 members were admitted, largely through the\r\nenergy and recommendations of the Committee on Membership, of which John\r\nJ. Lenehan, Esq., is chairman and active head. During the year we lost 7\r\nby death, 13 by resignation, and 23 by order of the Executive Council\r\nfor non-payment of dues. This leaves the membership of the Society in\r\ngood standing at present as follows: Life members, 74; annual members,\r\n828; total, 951.\r\n\r\nAlthough the membership is satisfactory in numbers and the Committee on\r\nMembership has performed a wonderful work during the past year, the\r\nSociety is not as large as it should be. Efforts should be made to\r\nascertain the names of those Americans prominent in all walks of life,\r\nin whose veins Irish blood flows and who are interested in seeing that\r\nthe history of our country chronicles and credits the doings of fellow\r\ncitizens of Irish blood equally with those of other nationalities, and\r\neach member should constitute himself a committee to act in conjunction\r\nwith the Membership Committee and obtain an addition to the Society\r\nwherever he can, always assuring himself that the applicant he presents\r\nis of good character and intelligence and interested in the work for\r\nwhich the Society is organized.\r\n\r\nThere are few distinguished families in the United States that are not\r\npartially of Irish ancestry, and since our Society has become so well\r\nknown throughout the country it has stimulated those who have never\r\ncared, for reasons best known to themselves, to cause it to be known\r\nthat Irish blood flowed in their veins, not only to admit the fact but\r\nreally and truly to assert it, and willingly to accept the credit that\r\ncomes from such ancestry. Many men whose entire time and energy are\r\ndevoted to extensive business will take little time to inform themselves\r\nof the doings of our Society, unless members in different localities\r\nwill take it upon themselves to seek out just such men, inform them of\r\nthe work we are doing, and enlist their hearty coöperation in it.\r\n\r\nWe are the largest and most prominent society of our kind in the United\r\nStates, and cover a field that until we were organized had been\r\npractically untouched. The influence of our work for the last few years\r\nhas been marked, and the average chronicler of American history will\r\nthink twice in recording events before he permits any bigotry or outside\r\ninfluence to prevent him from giving the American of Irish ancestry his\r\nshare of credit for deeds performed. The magazines and newspapers bear\r\nevidence of this, for, as soon as an attack is made upon the\r\nAmerican-Irishman or failure to give him his just due is discerned,\r\nthere are those who, stimulated by the influence of our Society in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, will immediately bring the erring party\r\nto bar and suggest the proper corrections.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of this spirit may be gained from a recent event in\r\nProvidence. A book called “The Modern City” was published and circulated\r\nby Professor Kirk of Brown University, and pretended to be a history of\r\nProvidence as it was and is, with sufficient general reference to\r\nsurrounding subjects to make it generally a complete history of that\r\ncity. Among the contributors were Professor William MacDonald, who\r\noccupies the chair of American history and whose work as an historian is\r\nhighly regarded both here and abroad, Professor Dealey, Professor Poland\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed upon an examination of this book that failure to give\r\ncredit to whom credit was due among our race was most marked, and\r\nimmediately the authors of these articles and Professor Kirk himself\r\nwere called to account by members of our Society, the truth properly\r\nexhibited and demonstrated, and the evil effect of the book as a work of\r\nhistory dissipated as far as Rhode Island and the city of Providence\r\nwere concerned. The members of our Society took hold of this matter with\r\na will, and the articles written and circulated with the purpose of\r\ncorrecting the work of these professors and stating fully and truthfully\r\nwhat they failed fairly to state, are now in the archives of the Society\r\nand open to the inspection of those who may be interested.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn several occasions I have suggested to the Society the advisability of\r\nhaving a more complete and less perfunctory business meeting. Until the\r\nannual meeting of 1909 it had been the custom to transact all of the\r\nbusiness of the Society between the hours of six and seven in the\r\nevening, and have all our scientific papers read at a dinner, which, by\r\nreason of them, would be prolonged to an unseemly hour. Opportunity to\r\nconsider and digest excellent papers was lacking, and no time whatever\r\nwas given for the discussion of them.\r\n\r\nAt our Washington meeting we transacted all of the Society’s business,\r\nwith the exception of the reading of certain papers, during the\r\nafternoon, so that we had the entire evening for the dinner and the\r\npresentation of four important papers. This year the Executive Council\r\ndecided that the business meeting should commence at two o’clock in the\r\nafternoon, and from that hour until five or half past we could present a\r\nnumber of scientific papers, elect our officers, read the monographs on\r\ndeceased members, and transact the other business of the Society.\r\n\r\nThis, in my opinion, is a step in the right direction, but not a\r\nsufficient one. There should be a session of at least two days, at which\r\nmembers from all over the country would be earnestly solicited to attend\r\nand for whom the railroads would give round-trip rates to our place of\r\nmeeting for one and one-third single fares. The first morning should be\r\ndevoted to the reading of two or three historical papers, followed by\r\ndiscussion. A luncheon should take place, given by some member of the\r\nSociety or by some organization affiliated with it or having some\r\nconnection with it. The afternoon session could be devoted to more\r\nhistorical papers and discussion, and in the evening a lecture should be\r\ngiven by some person of international reputation on subjects connected\r\nwith our work. The next day could be similarly used, and in the\r\nafternoon of the second day the officers of the Society for the ensuing\r\nyear might be elected; and that night the annual dinner of the Society\r\nwould take place, which, instead of being carried out with a studied\r\nprogramme filled with scientific literary matter, would be truly “a\r\nfeast of reason and a flow of soul,” where our members would have an\r\nopportunity to pass an evening of real sociability and pleasure, which\r\nwould be restful after two days’ work.\r\n\r\nSuch a convention would attract the greatest attention; our doings would\r\nbe reported in the public press, and our papers, carefully prepared by\r\nmen of ability, would in all probability be published, in part or in\r\nfull, thus doing more toward bringing the Society to the attention of\r\nthe American people in general than any other medium could possibly do.\r\nWhile it might be impossible for all of our members to attend two days,\r\nwe could have more of them present at some time during the convention\r\nthan attend the dinner at present.\r\n\r\nThe movement encouraging the attendance of ladies at our dinner has\r\nreceived hearty congratulations on all sides. There is no reason why\r\nwomen should not be interested in American history equally with men. The\r\nother historical societies encourage women to become members, and a step\r\nin the right direction has been inaugurated during the past year, when\r\nnot only were two leading Chicago women admitted as members of the\r\nSociety, but the Executive Council voted that our members could invite\r\nladies as guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DONATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Society is very much in need of endowments and donations. A fund\r\nshould be established, the income of which would be sufficient not only\r\nto maintain a proper building of modest proportions, in which the\r\narchives of the Society could be kept and the general headquarters\r\nmaintained, but to compensate historians and writers for work and\r\nresearch on lines that would be dictated by a committee having that\r\nbranch of our work in charge, as well as to furnish competitive prizes\r\nfor historical essays.\r\n\r\nIf a substantial fund for these purposes were at hand we might reduce\r\nthe dues from five dollars per annum to three dollars, leaving the life\r\nmembership fee as at present, and place on sale copies of our\r\npublications under the direction of a librarian, who would have charge,\r\nwith his other duties, of this branch.\r\n\r\nAll of the leading historical societies have substantial sums in their\r\ntreasury, contributed by interested members. Yet the American-Irish\r\nHistorical Society, nine-tenths of whose members are men of more or less\r\nwealth, has never, as far as I can see from an examination of the\r\nSociety’s records, received a single dollar for these purposes, and the\r\nSociety has done its work on its own meagre revenue, with no assistance\r\nsave the dues of its members.\r\n\r\nContemplating the liberal endowment of other historical and antiquarian\r\nassociations, the American-Irish Historical Society may justly be proud\r\nof its record; but this will not be a sufficient answer to the next\r\nthousand members that join our ranks. We must have suitable\r\nheadquarters, a suitable library and a proper place for our archives;\r\nestablish an exchange list with other libraries and institutions, and\r\nsolicit additions not only of books, prints and engravings, but other\r\narticles that are of historic interest; and all these should be under\r\nthe management of a librarian or custodian, by whom the large\r\ncorrespondence now entailed on the Secretary-General should be conducted\r\nand fostered.\r\n\r\nIt will take money to do these things, but not as large an amount as, at\r\nfirst blush, one would think. The Society having been incorporated in\r\nRhode Island, its headquarters must necessarily be there, and it is\r\nfitting that the centre of the work of this Society should be somewhere\r\nin New England. Massachusetts and Rhode Island have many historical and\r\nantiquarian societies, and nowhere in the whole United States is the\r\nspirit of historical research and pride of ancestry more strongly\r\ndeveloped than in these two states.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for an investment of less than five thousand dollars to\r\npurchase a lot and erect a building sufficient for our needs for many\r\nyears to come, within the shadow of Brown University on College Hill,\r\nwhich has for so many years been regarded as the seat of learning in\r\nRhode Island. This amount is mentioned after thoughtful consideration of\r\nthe needs of the Society, and would equip the building to contain a\r\nsubstantial library as well as the entire present equipment,\r\nparaphernalia and archives of the Society.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the newspaper accounts of the wills of various members\r\nof the Society who have deceased within the past two years, I have noted\r\nno bequest to our Society, yet many bequests to other public and private\r\ninstitutions. I cannot help but believe that if our needs were brought\r\nforcibly to the attention of the members, as I am striving to do in this\r\npart of my report, it might stimulate a bequest from those of our\r\nmembers who are able and interested enough to make one, for outside of\r\nthe charitable institutions there is no organization more worthy of\r\nstaunch support than is the American-Irish Historical Society, nor one\r\nwhich would put a gift to better use.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES.\r\n\r\nNo officer or member of this Society drawls any salary, but each officer\r\ndoes the work allotted to him with a good heart and for love of the\r\ncause. We are under no charges for rent and pay nothing for the\r\nexcellent articles which appear in our annual volume, the writers of\r\nthese coöperating with the officers and furnishing the time, energy and\r\nability necessary to make the researches entailed without any\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nThe entire expense outlay of the Society is for the printing, binding\r\nand circulation of the annual volume, the printing of circulars,\r\nstationery, etc., and postage, and a small sum for a stenographer in\r\nconducting the correspondence of my office, keeping track of the dues\r\nand other details; but I can easily see opportunities for the\r\ndissemination of knowledge and an enlarged application of the purposes\r\nfor which our Society was incorporated if we should have at our disposal\r\nthe modest sum of money herein mentioned. The members of the Society\r\nresiding in Rhode Island will gladly contribute in accordance with their\r\nmeans, and I embody this matter in my report at this time for the\r\npurpose of bringing it sharply for the first time to the attention of\r\nour members.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough repeated at other times heretofore, I beg to make the following\r\nsuggestions to our members, not only for their benefit, but for the\r\nconvenience of the Society’s administration as well:\r\n\r\n1. Annual dues should be paid promptly because upon these and the life\r\nmembership fees we depend for the payment of our obligations.\r\n\r\n2. Biographical sketches should be furnished when requested by the\r\nSecretary-General, and a member should not permit any feelings of\r\npersonal modesty to interfere with the desire of the Society to have in\r\nits archives as complete a statement of the life and works of each\r\nmember as he or his friends can give to it.\r\n\r\n3. Upon learning of the decease of any member, immediate notice should\r\nbe sent to the Secretary-General by telegraph, in order that the\r\nattention of the President-General may be called and a committee\r\nappointed to attend the funeral of the deceased member or to do whatever\r\nmay be needful or advisable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n4. Current local history is as much part of the work of the Society as\r\nis the delving into ancient records, and any newspaper clipping or\r\naccount of any public or private affair that, in the opinion of any\r\nmember, is of interest to the Society or its work should be promptly\r\nsent to the Secretary-General, who will gladly receive, index and place\r\nit in the archives of the Society, where it may be referred to in a\r\nconvenient form at any time.\r\n\r\n5. It is intended that the correct address of every member shall be\r\nrecorded in our files, and when a member changes his address he is\r\nrespectfully requested to notify the Secretary-General of that fact, so\r\nthat future communications may not be misdirected.\r\n\r\n6. Suggestions as to the management and improvement of the Society in\r\nits membership, line of work or in any other way are most earnestly\r\nsolicited, and any such suggestions, if sent to this office, wall be\r\nbrought before the Executive Council, which meets frequently, and\r\ncarefully considered by it.\r\n\r\n7. State Vice-Presidents are strongly urged to recruit in their\r\nrespective states the ranks of the Society, and to this end they will\r\nfind active and hearty coöperation. Vice-President Moloney of Illinois\r\nset the pace this year in obtaining fifty-one applications for\r\nmembership, all from persons who have made their mark in life and with\r\nwhom it is a pleasure for us to associate. Vice-President McCaffrey of\r\nPennsylvania, Vice-President O’Hagan of South Carolina, Vice-President\r\nCorbett of North Carolina, Vice-President Connolly of California, and\r\nVice-President McCarrick of Virginia have all done notable work and set\r\na good example, while Georgia, under the guidance of Vice-President\r\nFlannery and Dr. J. Lawton Hiers of the Executive Council, proposes to\r\nreturn a significant number of applications within a very short time.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I take this opportunity of paying a heartfelt tribute to\r\nthe efficiency and earnestness of President-General Quinlan,\r\nTreasurer-General Dooley, Chairman Lenehan of the Membership Committee,\r\nand the members of the Executive Council, all of whom have the best\r\nwelfare of the Society continually at heart and whose courtesy and great\r\nkindness have rendered my own shortcomings less marked and the work of\r\nthe Society a pleasure.\r\n\r\nMr. Michael F. Dooley, Treasurer-General of the Society, presented the\r\nfollowing report, covering the period from January 15, 1909, to January\r\n1, 1910, and the same was adopted by unanimous vote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                ANNUAL REPORT OF THE TREASURER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     PROVIDENCE, R.

Lenehan in behalf\r\nof the Membership Committee, and was accepted by unanimous vote:\r\n\r\nMR. LENEHAN: Mr. President, I did not expect to be called upon for any\r\nreport, and therefore am quite unprepared, and this particularly so\r\nbecause my work is necessarily confined to action rather than\r\nexpression. We have an eloquent President-General, and a\r\nSecretary-General who is surpassed by no one, either in eloquence or in\r\nability; wherefore it behooves those of us who labor behind the\r\nmachinery to work hard and say little.\r\n\r\nI may, however, say briefly that when we took up the work of the\r\nMembership Committee in October a year ago, we found the roll contained\r\nabout 545 members, of whom perhaps 100 were somewhat inactive, being\r\nremiss in their dues and not taking all the interest they might have\r\ntaken in the affairs of our Society; so that substantially the active\r\nmembership was about 450.\r\n\r\nInside of fourteen months we have brought the membership up to nearly\r\n1,000, including many life members. We introduced them into our circle\r\nfrom all over the United States and even further, for they included\r\nmembers from such far distant points as the Hon. Thomas J. O’Brien,\r\nAmerican Ambassador to Japan, and Richard Bradshaw of Fort Pickens,\r\nFlorida. United States Senators, Congressmen, generals, bankers,\r\nmerchants—the best men throughout the land have joined our ranks.\r\n\r\nIt required hard work; but, as the Treasurer-General has pointed out, we\r\nbrought in about 400 members and nearly $2,000 in money at a cost of\r\napproximately $700, which, as a business venture, has the endorsement of\r\na bank president, our Treasurer-General.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of this increase is that, if we have 500 new members\r\nand they pay us $2,500 a year, while there is no further expense in\r\nconnection with those members, they return each year an annual dividend\r\nof $2,500, which will readily equal the dividends paid by any good,\r\nworking trust. So much for the genius of the race.\r\n\r\nThe work progresses splendidly. This morning’s receipts, for example,\r\nconsisted of five names. I have just handed them to the\r\nSecretary-General in the form we always pursue, but it will give you an\r\nidea of the membership we get and the way they come in if I read them to\r\nyou:\r\n\r\nMr. John P. Donohoe, a director of the Barclay-Westmoreland Trust\r\nCompany of Greensburg, Pa.; Major George W. McNulty, a civil engineer\r\nand a man very highly regarded in constructive work in this city of New\r\nYork; Mr. John J. Powers, cashier of the Exchange Bank of Savannah,\r\nGeorgia, and President of the Knights of Columbus Investment company;\r\nJohn G. Butler of Savannah, Lieutenant-Colonel of the 1st Infantry\r\nNational Guard of Georgia, proposed by Colonel O’Leary, who is Colonel\r\nof the First Regiment of Infantry of Savannah; Mr. Butler is president\r\nof the J. G. Butler Supply Company, a director of the Citizens Trust\r\nCompany, and Grand Knight of the Knights of Columbus; Mr. Thomas M.\r\nBlake of this City, proposed by Mr. Danvers; and Mr. Desmond FitzGerald\r\nof Brookline, Mass., past President of the American Society of Civil\r\nEngineers and consulting Hydraulic Engineer.\r\n\r\nThe committee would urge that each one bring in at least one new member\r\nthis year, so that we may have 2,000 members before the close of 1910.\r\n\r\nI trust the work of the Membership Committee meets with your\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: The next order of business will be the report of the\r\nConstitutional Committee. I will ask Mr. O’Brien to report in behalf of\r\nthat committee.\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN E. O’BRIEN: Mr. President and Fellow Members, the committee\r\nappointed at the last annual meeting were called together shortly after\r\ntheir appointment and decided that it was important that the\r\nconstitution should be amended in several matters. The present\r\nconstitution is somewhat antiquated, and that applies equally to the\r\nby-laws because of changed conditions and changes in policy. For\r\nexample, under the present by-laws the dues are only two or three\r\ndollars a year, whereas we have been charging five dollars; and the\r\nofficers provided for are somewhat different than those that have been\r\nelected for years. The committee, therefore, have determined upon and\r\nbeg to submit the following constitution. I hesitate to read this, Mr.\r\nPresident, because it is rather long.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: Could you not read it in abstract? Then we shall get the\r\nessence of it. Will it come before the meeting for action?\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM H. DELANEY, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  Of New York City.\r\n\r\n  A Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMR. LENEHAN: Mr. President, I would suggest that a constitution which\r\ncovers so many points ought more properly to be printed and possibly\r\nsubmitted to the Executive Council for consideration, and later may be\r\nsubmitted to the Society for other suggestions.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: That is a splendid suggestion and if the reader will accept\r\nthe same and incorporate it in his report, I think it will be very wise.\r\nAs you say, Mr. O’Brien, it is rather lengthy.\r\n\r\nMR. O’BRIEN: I think it is a very good suggestion. The present\r\nconstitution provides it may be amended at any regular meeting, so it\r\nseems unnecessary to give notice. I second the recommendation and hope,\r\nwhen this comes before the members of the Society, they will compare it\r\ncarefully with the constitution now printed in the Journal, and\r\nrecommendations of any changes will be very gladly received. Therefore I\r\nmove that this be referred to the Executive Council, and that they be\r\ninstructed to provide for the printing and distribution of the same\r\namong the members of the Society.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: I will ask, however, that Mr. O’Brien give in a brief way\r\nan abstract of it, alluding to the salient changes.\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN J. ROONEY: I will make a further suggestion. We are all of us\r\nmore or less familiar with the present constitution, and, instead of an\r\nabstract, he might indicate the changes.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: Very good. Mr. O’Brien, will you proceed?\r\n\r\nMR. O’BRIEN: In the first place, we say the object of the Society is “to\r\nmake better known the Irish chapter in American history,” substituting\r\nthat in the place of about two pages.\r\n\r\nUnder Article II, entitled “Membership,” we provide for three classes of\r\nmembers, life, annual and honorary. We see no necessity for\r\ncorresponding members, and, in fact, I believe there are none such in\r\nthe Society.\r\n\r\nThe provisions in regard to applications for membership are about the\r\nsame as at present. Election shall be by the Executive Council or at the\r\nannual meetings of the Society. Dues are fixed at $5.00 for annual\r\nmembership, and are made payable on the first day of January in each\r\nyear in advance. The life membership fee remains the same.\r\n\r\nTo the officers we have added a Vice-President-General, there being no\r\nprovision for such an officer in the present constitution.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the Executive Council we have defined somewhat more\r\nclearly, generally to manage and conduct the affairs of the Society. We\r\nhave provided that six members thereof shall be a quorum.\r\n\r\nWe have defined the duties of the officers a little more definitely than\r\nin the present constitution. There is one thing in particular that I\r\nwould say in this regard: In the present constitution it is provided\r\nthat the duties of the Historiographer shall be the usual duties of that\r\noffice. That was rather indefinite, so we substitute this instead: “The\r\nHistoriographer shall write such histories or historical articles as the\r\nExecutive Council may from time to time require; assist in the\r\npreparation of the annual journal and other historical works of the\r\nsociety; and perform the other duties usually pertaining to his office.”\r\n\r\nWe provide for an annual meeting to be held in the month of January in\r\neach year, the day and place to be determined by the Society in general\r\nmeeting, or by the Executive Council in case the Society fails to do so.\r\nSpecial meetings of the Society may be called at any time by the\r\nExecutive Council. A quorum for the transaction of business at all\r\nmeetings of the Society is fixed at thirty-five, instead of ten, as at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nState Chapters: We have provided that ten or more members of good\r\nstanding in this Society may organize a subsidiary chapter by obtaining\r\na charter from the Executive Council; that the Vice-President of this\r\nSociety for the particular state shall, by virtue of that office, be\r\nPresident of that chapter, and such chapter may elect from their own\r\nnumber a Vice-Chairman, a Secretary, a Treasurer and such other officers\r\nas may be necessary to manage its affairs; and that membership in such\r\nchapters shall be limited to members of this Society in good standing.\r\n\r\nThose are the principal points, Mr. President.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: You have heard this report. What is your pleasure in the\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\nMR. MARTIN I. J. GRIFFIN: Mr. President, why should it be referred to\r\nthe Executive Council? It will be another year before it comes before\r\nthe Society again. We have been without the revision for a whole year,\r\nand now it is proposed to be postponed again. I believe it should be\r\nacted upon here. I move that the report be read and acted upon.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: That would consume more time than possibly the afternoon\r\nsession would permit, and I am afraid it would take away from the\r\nscientific part of our programme.\r\n\r\nMR. GRIFFIN: The same would apply next year.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: We will take it up as a whole next year.\r\n\r\nMR. CRIMMINS: I concur with the last speaker. It seems to me eminently\r\nproper that we should act upon the matter at this time. I fully agree\r\nwith the remark of the last gentleman that possibly this might be\r\npostponed for another year. It seemed to me very clear and concise\r\nlanguage was used, and covered all the situations that might arise in\r\nthe administration of the Society, and I move now, in general, that the\r\nsuggestion made by the gentlemen who proposed these amendments be\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nMR. LENEHAN: The constitution is the most important document which this\r\nSociety could possibly pass upon. If the committee who were entrusted\r\nwith the charge of this matter had had it printed and distributed among\r\nthe members we would have come here today prepared to vote on it in an\r\nintelligent manner. If we vote on the constitution as proposed now, we\r\nare voting upon something about which we know little, for it has not\r\nbeen read. I, for one, will not vote on a paper I have not read. If we\r\nare going to vote intelligently we must take it up section by section,\r\nhave each read and voted upon separately.\r\n\r\nWe have struggled along for twelve years with our present constitution,\r\nand I do not see that the Society will suffer any injury if we are\r\nobliged to continue the work under the present constitution for twelve\r\nmonths longer. In the meantime the committee can print its report and\r\ndistribute the same among the members and if there should be any need\r\nfor expedition it could be referred to the Executive Council with power\r\nto consider the matter and adopt such constitution as they deem wise. In\r\nthat way the constitution could be adopted in three or four months’\r\ntime, and in the meantime, if we are furnished with copies, we shall\r\nhave the benefit of careful consideration of the same. If we vote now it\r\nmay be for something we shall regret later. Safety lies in thorough\r\nconsideration of the subject, and I therefore hope, Mr. President, that\r\nthe motion to adopt this constitution unread, unseen, unheard, will be\r\neither withdrawn or defeated.\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS S. LONERGAN: How soon does the Executive Council of the\r\nSociety meet?\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: Subject to the chair. We meet four or five times a year.\r\n\r\nMR. LONERGAN: I move an amendment to the last motion that the committee\r\non the revision of the constitution submit its report to the Executive\r\nCouncil, and that the Executive Council print that report and distribute\r\nsame among the members.\r\n\r\nMR. CRIMMINS: Mr. President, where will that leave us?\r\n\r\nMR. LONERGAN: You will have it in three months.\r\n\r\nMR. CRIMMINS: It seems to me, after listening to the suggestions made,\r\nthat the proposed constitution, in a few concise words, states our\r\nannual dues and also fixes the number of members constituting a quorum\r\nfor the transaction of business. It makes another provision which I\r\nthink very important, that in relation to state chapters. I don’t like\r\nto differ with Mr. Lenehan because there is no other member who has any\r\nmore interest in the Society than he has, and no more effective work has\r\nbeen done by anyone than by him. Still I see no reason why we should not\r\ntake action on this matter today.\r\n\r\nThe salient points in the constitution are very well put, and it seems\r\nto me we would get along a little faster if we adopted it in general.\r\nThere might be a few corrections to be made, and they could be referred\r\nto the Executive Council, which could complete the work and then send\r\nout printed copies to the members of the Society. You know yourself, Mr.\r\nPresident, how difficult it is to get any great number together, and we\r\nprobably would not, within a year, get as large a number of members at a\r\nmeeting as today. That is my idea; I am not at all alarmed with the\r\nhaste to be made by action today.\r\n\r\nMR. T. VINCENT BUTLER: I heartily endorse the statement of the last\r\nspeaker. I think this entire constitution could be read and passed on\r\nintelligently inside of a space of three-quarters of an hour. It is\r\neminently proper that it should be brought up before this meeting. The\r\ncommittee who brings this constitution, or simply an amendment in a few\r\nfeatures of something already existing, has done so with care and\r\ndeliberation. It will be absolutely impossible to have the excellent\r\nresults come from the same unless it is immediately adopted, and there\r\nshould be no delay in passing promptly upon the various changes\r\nsuggested. I therefore move, Mr. Chairman, as the sense of this meeting,\r\nthat we proceed to pass upon the constitution with the various\r\namendments outlined immediately.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: You have heard the motion before the house. Was Mr.\r\nLonergan’s amendment previously made seconded?\r\n\r\nMR. ROONEY: Yes.\r\n\r\nMR. DELANY: Mr. Chairman, I think Mr. Lonergan is more or less\r\nreconciled by the suggestion of Mr. Crimmins that the constitution be\r\nreferred to the Executive Council with power to act.\r\n\r\nMR. LENEHAN: Mr. Chairman, if this committee had prepared a copy of the\r\nconstitution and sent it to the members asking for suggestions, if the\r\ncommittee had discharged its duty in an orderly manner as I consider, it\r\nwould have prepared and sent this document around to the members, and we\r\nwould thereby have been prepared today to act intelligently upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the chopping off of the first paragraph of our\r\npresent constitution, and restating the purpose of this Society in two\r\nor three lines. The purposes of this Society as expressed in the\r\nconstitution as it now stands are most beautifully expressed. It is such\r\nan eloquent exposition of our ideas that under no circumstances should\r\nit be erased from the constitution. I have a copy of it here, and I ask\r\nit to be read so that we may contrast it with this proposed amendment\r\nwhich puts in two or three lines the purpose of this Society. It is\r\nsplendidly, eloquently, magnificently expressed in our present\r\nconstitution by a master of the English language, and I ask any man to\r\nread it, put it side by side with this proposed amendment, and note the\r\neloquence with which the purpose of our Society is expressed.\r\n\r\nMR. T. V. BUTLER: I claim the gentleman is not in order. There is a\r\nmotion before the house.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: This is a debatable subject.\r\n\r\nMR. LONERGAN: My amendment, Mr. President, is to Mr. Crimmins’ motion,\r\nthat this revised constitution by the committee be sent to the Executive\r\nbody, and I wish to say here that the Executive body is more\r\nrepresentative of this Society than this gathering here today; and why,\r\nbecause there are a thousand members in the Society, and we have less\r\nthan a hundred here today. I therefore move that this revised\r\nconstitution be sent to the Executive Council, with power to amend and\r\nrevise, and that a copy thereof be sent forward to every member within\r\nthree months’ time.\r\n\r\nMR. O’BRIEN: This proposed constitution has been signed and approved by\r\nJudge Lee, Mr. Joseph T. Ryan, Mr. Patrick J. McCarthy and John E.\r\nO’Brien. It has had considerable study, and its provisions are very\r\nsimple. We think it is more businesslike and a little more artistic,\r\nperhaps, than the present one. It has not been submitted in writing to\r\nthe members of the Society for two reasons: first, the present\r\nconstitution does not require any such submission; and in the second\r\nplace, it would take time and there would be considerable expense.\r\n\r\nNow, these terms are very plain and simple. They are drawn in a\r\nbusinesslike way rather than in beautiful language; there is no attempt\r\nat that. And since the statement of the purpose of the Society has been\r\nparticularly spoken of, I will say that the matter was brought to our\r\nattention by former officers of the Society, who thought the present\r\nstatement, while couched in beautiful language, was rather out of place\r\nin a businesslike constitution.\r\n\r\nI do believe, now, after considering the matter and talking with Judge\r\nLee, that this might be passed upon. He has approved it, it has been in\r\neffect approved by the Executive Council, and I don’t think it should be\r\ndelayed for another year. If necessary, it might be read; I can read it\r\nin ten minutes, perhaps.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: The amendment of Mr. Lonergan is before the house. All who\r\nare in favor of the same signify by saying “aye.”\r\n\r\nMR. LONERGAN: It seems to me before the question is put everybody should\r\nhave a chance to speak, so that when we vote we can do so intelligently.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: We have so much business on hand this afternoon that my\r\nidea was to get this question disposed of, not that we wish to curtail\r\nanything; but these matters take up so much time and there is so much\r\nscientific matter, our programme is so lengthy, that I simply want to be\r\nfair and just to everybody.\r\n\r\nGENERAL COLLINS: I have no desire to take up the time unnecessarily, but\r\nit seems to me we do not make a constitution every day in the week, and\r\nI am heartily in accord with the suggestion made by Mr. Lenehan that it\r\nshould be left over. I do not think, as a matter of fact, we have any\r\nright to adopt a constitution. It is a question to me why every member\r\nof the Society ought not to be notified. Where members are living in all\r\nparts of the country and it is practically impossible for some of them\r\nto attend the meetings, it seems to me every member should be notified\r\nor a copy of the new constitution should be served on them. We do not\r\nmake a constitution every day in the week, and the matter can very well\r\nwait over. It seems to me no detriment would be incurred by reason of\r\nholding over.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: You have heard the motion that this constitution be\r\nreferred to the Executive Council for revision.\r\n\r\nMR. CRIMMINS: You mean by that the Executive Council would have to\r\nreport back to the Society?\r\n\r\nMR. LONERGAN: I want to be as brief as possible. I take it the Executive\r\nCouncil is more representative of the Society at large than this\r\ngathering is, and I therefore move that this revised constitution be\r\nsubmitted to the Executive Council, with power to amend and revise, and\r\nthat a copy thereof be sent forward to every member.\r\n\r\nGENERAL COLLINS: Can this Society delegate the power of adopting a\r\nconstitution to the Executive Council?\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: The Executive Council would have to report back to the\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nGENERAL COLLINS: The gentleman’s motion does not concur with that idea.\r\nHis idea is that we submit it to the Executive Council with power to\r\nadopt, and it shall then stand.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: I don’t think that would be constitutional. It must be\r\nvoted upon by the Society at large. Mr. Lonergan’s amendment is before\r\nthe house. All in favor signify by saying “aye.” It seems to be carried;\r\nit is carried.\r\n\r\nAll who are in favor of Mr. Lonergan’s motion will stand until counted.\r\nForty-three.\r\n\r\nAll who are opposed to Mr. Lonergan’s motion will stand until counted.\r\nTwenty-seven.\r\n\r\nThese voices must have stentorian tones, if not a re-echo. The chair\r\nreverses its decision, and the verdict is that Mr. Lonergan’s amendment\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nJUDGE LEE: That was your decision in the first place.\r\n\r\nGENERAL COLLINS: I understand the decision, as interpreted by the chair,\r\nto be that the Executive Council report back to another meeting of the\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: That was the interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe next business in order being the election of officers for the\r\nensuing year, the Secretary-General read the following list of nominees\r\nselected by the Executive Council to be voted upon at this meeting, and\r\nthe same were elected by unanimous vote to serve until the next meeting\r\nand until others are chosen in their stead:\r\n\r\n                          _President-General_,\r\n\r\n                   FRANCIS J.

JOYCE: I ask that the report of the nominating committee be\r\namended by inserting under Vice-Presidents, “Australia, Mr. Frank\r\nCoffey.” Mr. Coffey is a native of New York, who emigrated to Australia\r\nthirty-five years ago and makes a pilgrimage here every two years. He is\r\none of the leading merchants of Australia, and I proposed him at his own\r\nrequest. Since his election, he has sent in the names of two others,\r\naccompanied by his check for their dues. I think a man who takes an\r\ninterest of that kind is entitled to some recognition of it.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: Vice-Presidents are provided for in the different States of\r\nthe Union. May I ask if the constitution provides for or permits a\r\nVice-President in the country suggested? I think, if the constitution\r\ndoes not so provide, it ought to. Mr. O’Brien, will you kindly inform\r\nus?\r\n\r\nMR. O’BRIEN: I believe it is only so provided in the cases of Canada and\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: The motion of Mr. Joyce is in order and has been duly\r\nseconded. All in favor of the same signify by saying “aye,” those\r\nopposed “no.” It is carried.\r\n\r\nMR. T. VINCENT BUTLER: Before we proceed, Mr. President, to the\r\nintellectual treat, may I be permitted to relieve myself of a very\r\nperplexing pecuniary situation. As the treasurer of the New York State\r\nChapter of the American-Irish Historical Society, in connection with the\r\nHudson-Fulton Celebration, I would like to make my final report to\r\nsomebody.\r\n\r\nQuestion as to whether or not the speaker was in order was raised and\r\ndiscussed, whereupon Dr. Quinlan remarked:\r\n\r\nThe chair will listen to Mr. Butler, but we will ask him to come to the\r\npoint quickly because our time is short.\r\n\r\nMR. BUTLER: Gentlemen, this is simply a brief report of what became of a\r\ncontribution of $126 from twenty-seven of our members.\r\n\r\nAt a special meeting held in Delmonico’s in May, 1909, the suggestion\r\nwas made that the American-Irish Historical Society should interest\r\nthemselves by coöperating with the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in\r\nproperly celebrating the Hudson-Fulton celebration. As an evidence of\r\nthe appreciation of our members in that direction we received at that\r\nmeeting contributions of five dollars each from the following gentlemen:\r\n\r\n                       J. I. C. Clarke      $5.00\r\n                       Dr. Quinlan           5.00\r\n                       J.

QUINLAN: This is really a part of the business of the State Chapter,\r\nand the report should be accepted through the Vice-President. I will ask\r\nMr. Clarke to receive the same.\r\n\r\nMR. BUTLER: Mr. President, I think it is also eminently proper that we\r\nrecognize our obligation to the members of our Society who guaranteed\r\nfifty dollars each towards expenses. The amount is small, but let it be\r\nrecognized as a liability.\r\n\r\nMR. JOSEPH I. C. CLARKE: The matter that Mr. Butler has brought before\r\nthe meeting is really a matter belonging to the New York Chapter, and I\r\ndon’t think it is pertinent with this meeting at all. I shall be very\r\nglad at a subsequent meeting of the chapter to take up this matter. The\r\nmoney that was collected has been expended, and I believe there is still\r\na balance. I would like to see the meeting proceed to the literary end\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: The next order of proceedings will be the presentation of\r\nscientific papers. The first to have been read was by Hon. Joseph F.\r\nO’Connell, member of Congress from Massachusetts. Unfortunately, Mr.\r\nO’Connell is detained unavoidably at Boston on account of a hotly\r\ncontested municipal election, and has notified us of his inability to be\r\npresent. He will, however, submit his paper to the Secretary-General\r\nlater, which, after approval by the Executive Council, will be ordered\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nThe next is an article on Stonewall Jackson by John Louis Sheehan, LL.\r\nD., Professor at Boston University School of Law.\r\n\r\nDR. SHEEHAN: Mr. President-General, Officers and Members of the American\r\nIrish Historical Society, it gives me great pleasure today to pay\r\ntribute to the memory of that hero of the South, Thomas “Stonewall”\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nDoctor Sheehan then read his paper, which is printed in full elsewhere\r\nin this volume.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: As these papers are published in full in the Journal of the\r\nSociety, and as our time is getting so short, I will ask, if it be\r\nconsistent, that the readers give them in abstract.\r\n\r\nThe next article is by Mr. Joseph I. C. Clarke, Vice-President of the\r\nSociety for New York, on the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. This paper is of\r\ngreat length and has been prepared with the utmost care and painstaking\r\neffort by Vice-President Clarke, complying with a vote of the Society\r\nrequesting the same, passed October 1, 1909, at an informal meeting of\r\nthe Society on board the “Asbury Park.” The introduction to this article\r\nnot being complete at this time, the reading will be omitted, but the\r\npaper ordered printed in its entirety in Volume IX.\r\n\r\nThe next is by Hon. James Fitzgerald, Justice of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe State of New York, on the Sixty-Ninth Regiment.\r\n\r\nJUDGE FITZGERALD: Mr. President and Gentlemen: I felt honored by the\r\nrequest to prepare a paper for this interesting meeting and was\r\nparticularly pleased that the subject suggested was one very near to my\r\nheart as it is to the hearts of all men of Irish blood in America. We\r\nhave just listened to the splendid eulogy by the gentleman from Boston\r\nof a great soldier who fell in the Civil War battling for the lost\r\ncause. My paper deals with the record of the gallant 69th Regiment,\r\nwhich fought so valiantly for the Union, and it is a high tribute to the\r\nnature of our institutions and the character of our people to be able to\r\nsay that an eulogy of this regiment delivered in Charleston, Savannah or\r\nRichmond would be as enthusiastically received as the address on\r\nStonewall Jackson has been received in New York.\r\n\r\nI have prepared a paper and hold it in my hand as we say in the courts\r\nas “the best evidence” that I have performed the work. The story of the\r\nSixty-ninth is, however, necessarily a long one; it involves a recital\r\nof many glorious events, and its reading, even in the condensed form of\r\nmy paper, would, in view of the many matters to be disposed of at this\r\ngathering, occupy too much of your time. I will, therefore, only tell\r\nyou about it in the abstract, requesting, as is frequently done in\r\nCongress, “leave to print.”\r\n\r\nThe Sixty-ninth has existed as a regiment for nearly sixty years, and\r\nthroughout all that period, in peace and in war, its ranks have\r\npractically been made up of men of Irish blood; it is the typical\r\nIrish-American regiment, and its record is a source of pride and\r\npleasure, not only to Irishmen and their descendants, but to all\r\nAmericans. You may call us Irish-Americans or American-Irish, but we\r\nare, nevertheless, Americans of the American. We were among the earliest\r\nsettlers upon the Continent; we kept on coming steadily from those early\r\ntimes in large numbers, and under existing conditions upon the other\r\nside of the Atlantic, it is fair to predict that the flow of Irish\r\nemigration to the United States is liable to continue in the future. The\r\nexpressions, “Irish-American” or “American-Irish,” in their real\r\nsignificance, mean intense, true Americans. We love the Union, we are\r\ndevoted to the principles of the Constitution; we are obedient to the\r\nlaw; we are peaceable, industrious and loyal. For all our fellow\r\nAmericans, no matter what their national origin, we entertain a spirit\r\nof fraternity and are bound to them by the ties of common brotherhood;\r\nthe flag of the Republic is for us the symbol of a sovereignty under\r\nwhich we are proud and happy to live, and in defense of which we are at\r\nall times ready to take up arms.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, the prompt response of Corcoran to the call of President\r\nLincoln sounded a bugle note of readiness electric in its effect. Nearly\r\nforty years thereafter, upon the breaking out of the Spanish War, the\r\nGovernment was desirous of obtaining exact information as to the extent\r\nthe organized militia of all the different states could be depended\r\nupon. Major-General Roe, at that time the commander of the National\r\nGuard of the State of New York, communicated with the different\r\nregimental commanders, inquiring what number of men belonging to the\r\nmilitia would volunteer to serve the Government beyond the territorial\r\nlimits of the state. The answer of Colonel Duffy, in 1898, rang true as\r\nthe answer from Corcoran in ’61:\r\n\r\n“Every officer and every enlisted man of the 69th volunteers to defend\r\nthe flag in any part of the world the government may require their\r\nservices.”\r\n\r\nWhen a French delegation was sent here a few years ago to participate in\r\nthe ceremonies connected with the unveiling of the Statue of Rochambeau\r\nat Washington, its members were entertained in this city by The Friendly\r\nSons of St. Patrick; their escort to the banquet at Delmonico’s was the\r\n69th Regiment, and General Brugere and Admiral Fournier were warm in\r\ntheir praise of the appearance of the regiment; and later, when\r\nPresident Roosevelt was the guest of the same Society at its 121st\r\nAnnual Dinner on St. Patrick’s Day, 1905, the regiment again acted as\r\nescort to the distinguished guest of the Society.\r\n\r\nColonel Duffy, who served in the regiment for a period of over forty\r\nyears and commanded it during the Spanish War, has recently resigned\r\nwith the rank of brigadier-general. Lieutenant-Colonel Conley has since\r\nbeen in command, and it was only last night that I received a most\r\ninteresting item of news from him. In the office of the adjutant-general\r\nof the State at Albany, the reports contain practically no record of the\r\nwar services of the 69th, the reason being, it is presumed, that during\r\nthat time it was out of the service of the State and constituted part of\r\nthe National armed force known as United States Volunteers. Every\r\nregiment of the National Guard is entitled to have a silver ring upon\r\nits lances for each engagement in which it participated and for other\r\nmeritorious service rendered in times of danger. Owing to the defective\r\nstate records, the 69th, after participating in all of the battles of\r\nthe war, from Bull Run to Appomattox, has been denied the privilege of\r\nplacing these commemorative rings upon its lances. Colonel Conley\r\ninformed me last evening, and I am happy to be able to announce to you\r\ntoday, that this inexcusable error is about being redressed, and in the\r\nnext report of the adjutant-general, the full record of the regiment in\r\nthe Civil War will be published, and the lance of the National\r\nRegimental Color will for the future be practically covered with\r\ninscribed rings bearing the name and date of the hundred battles in\r\nwhich it has participated.\r\n\r\nAll these matters will be found more fully set forth in this paper which\r\nI have prepared, and I can only express in conclusion the assurance that\r\nas long as the spirit which animated the 69th Regiment in the past\r\ncontinues to inspire the manhood of America, we need have little fear of\r\nattempted domestic revolution or of the perils of foreign war.\r\n\r\nJudge Fitzgerald’s paper is printed in full elsewhere in this volume.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: The next paper is by Michael X. Sullivan, Ph. D., formerly\r\nof the faculty of Brown University and now of the Bureau of Soil,\r\nWashington, D. C.\r\n\r\nDoctor Sullivan read his paper, which is printed in full elsewhere in\r\nthis volume.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: Before we proceed to the next paper, I would like to\r\nintroduce to you the vice-president-general of our Society, Mr. Thomas\r\nB. Fitzpatrick of Boston.\r\n\r\nMR. FITZPATRICK: I am very glad to meet the members of the\r\nAmerican-Irish Historical Society here today. It has been of special\r\ninterest to listen to the excellent papers read and the speeches\r\ndelivered by some of our worthy representatives. The facts referred to\r\nconcerning the proud position held by our race in the past and in the\r\npresent, are a valuable asset of information to every man and woman of\r\nIrish blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THOMAS M. MULVY, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  President of the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank of New York.\r\n\r\n  A Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI was very much impressed by the last speaker, Judge Fitzgerald, when he\r\nemphasized the fact that whether we are Irish-Americans or\r\nAmerican-Irish, we are part and parcel of this great country. It\r\nreminded me of what I had heard a great thinker in our own city say a\r\nfew years ago (the late Mr. Edward Atkinson) upon the subject of\r\nrestricted immigration. He, with two other very representative men,\r\ndiscussed this question of restricted immigration before the Beacon\r\nSociety of Boston. His opening salutation was: “Fellow Immigrants, the\r\nBeacon Society of Boston.” It is needless to say they were surprised at\r\nthis unexpected and novel introduction. It was sufficiently explained,\r\nhowever, when he said: “Some of your forefathers may have come over in\r\nthe ‘Mayflower,’ some of them fifteen generations ago, some of them ten,\r\nsome of them perhaps not more than three or four; but you must remember\r\nthat the space of time between the landing of the first immigrant and\r\nthose of today marks but a short period in the lifetime of a nation, and\r\ntherefore we are a nation of immigrants. We have no more right to say\r\ntoday to the immigrant landing on our shores that he must not land, than\r\nyour forefathers and mine had to forbid the landing of the immigrants of\r\ntheir day.”\r\n\r\nI believe, Mr. President, that it would be well for us to appreciate Mr.\r\nAtkinson’s statement that this is virtually a new country, a land of\r\nimmigrants, and that we are all Americans. As Americans, we are\r\ninterested in everything that concerns the well-being of this great and\r\nglorious republic, being mindful at the same time of the priceless\r\ninheritance it is to every man of our blood to sacredly treasure what\r\nhas been accomplished by the people of our race in the history and\r\ndevelopment of this new world. I am glad that these papers are to be\r\npublished in order that they may be preserved as a fruitful means of\r\ninspiration for future generations. It shows the great field of endeavor\r\nthat is open to this worthy association.\r\n\r\nMR. MARTIN I. J. GRIFFIN: Mr. President, as these papers are to be\r\npublished, it is essential that no known errors should appear in them,\r\nthat is, in the papers published in the name of the Society.\r\n\r\nIn the last paper read, it was stated that James Logan was more tolerant\r\nthan William Penn in the matter of the celebration of Mass in\r\nPhiladelphia. I know that not to be a fact. The speaker has\r\nmisinterpreted what he alleges to be a fact. William Penn did not object\r\nto Mass being celebrated in Philadelphia, and therefore James Logan was\r\nnot more tolerant in allowing it.\r\n\r\nThe Episcopalians objected to the public celebration of Mass in\r\nPhiladelphia. William Penn was in London at the time, and was notified\r\nby the English government of the fact that Mass had been celebrated.\r\nThereupon Penn wrote to James Logan, his agent, to send him the fact of\r\nthe matter. He did not say anything about the “scandal of the Mass,” but\r\nthat Mass was celebrated in a “scandalous manner.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn was the Father of Religious Liberty in America, and it was\r\nfounded in Philadelphia, not elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut a more important statement which is common belief among us Irish and\r\nis constantly repeated, but which has no foundation in fact, is that\r\none-half of the Revolutionary Army was Irish, and Joseph Galloway is\r\nquoted as proof of that.\r\n\r\nDr. Sullivan has only to go to the library and get a copy of the\r\nExamination of Joseph Galloway by a Committee of the House of Commons,\r\nand he will find that, upon his making the statement the Doctor has\r\nrecited, Galloway was asked how he knew that. His reply was, “By the\r\ndeserters that came in.”\r\n\r\nI might state that previous to the Revolutionary War, Joseph Galloway\r\nhad been Speaker in the Assembly. When Sir William Howe took possession\r\nof the city of Philadelphia, Joseph Galloway, having gone over to the\r\nBritish side, was appointed Superintendent of the City by him.\r\n\r\nAnd I would say that, if the question as to what proportion of the\r\nRevolutionary Army was made up of men of our race is to be asked, we are\r\nthe ones who should answer it, and not let our enemies do it. Therefore,\r\nI have always objected to that statement of Joseph Galloway’s. It is not\r\nexactly true, for I secured his report giving figures of deserters of\r\nWashington’s army at Valley Forge, and the galleys in the Delaware\r\nRiver. It was about forty-five per cent., not fifty.\r\n\r\nBut I ask the members not to have that statement published. Joseph\r\nGalloway was a deserter from the cause of Liberty and went over to the\r\nBritish. When he was before the committee of the House of Commons he\r\nmade that statement; but we do not give the answer he made when\r\nquestioned as to how he knew. It is unfair to have that answer produced\r\nagainst us when we make the statement that one-half of the Revolutionary\r\nArmy was Irish.\r\n\r\nWhile all the State forces and the Continental Army were largely Irish,\r\nI have no belief whatever that one-half of the Revolutionary Army was at\r\nany time composed of natives of Ireland. We ought not to assert that it\r\nwas because we cannot prove it. Nothing should appear in our official\r\nproceedings but what we can prove if called upon to do so.\r\n\r\nThat is why I speak for accuracy in all statements. I would ask that\r\nthose two, with any others that may be found, be stricken out or\r\nrevised, and that all the papers be submitted for criticism so that\r\nnothing will appear in the records of the American-Irish Historical\r\nSociety but what we can submit to the country as well-founded. But those\r\nstatements relative to Joseph Galloway and William Penn and James Logan\r\nought to be revised.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: I think it is certainly befitting that we should go before\r\nthe world as correct historians, and not state facts unless\r\nwell-founded.\r\n\r\nDR. SULLIVAN: I don’t think there is any controversy about the matters\r\nsuggested. My research has been an entirely scientific one, and we never\r\nlet anything go out of our department unless we have good evidence to\r\nbase it upon. Before the paper goes out, those remarks will all be\r\nverified. I see no reason for any controversy.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: I thought the subject might be discussed. Perhaps it would\r\nbe well for you and Mr. Griffin to take it up together.\r\n\r\nMR. RYAN: I think Mr. Talley’s point is admirably taken. There is one\r\nthing I would like to mention that has just come to my notice. One of\r\nthe professors of Harvard University died within a very short time, and\r\nit is interesting to know that at the time of his death he was engaged\r\nin writing an article on the life and doings of Daniel Shay. At a recent\r\nmeeting of an historical society here, the sentiment was expressed that\r\nthe manuscript was in such shape that it would be a valuable\r\ncontribution to American history if it should be published by somebody\r\nwho would take an interest in the work.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: We have additional papers to be submitted. At the close of\r\nthe reading of these, I shall be very happy to receive what suggestions\r\nyou may have to offer in that regard.\r\n\r\nThe next article is by Rev. Cornelius F. O’Leary of Wellston, Mo.\r\n\r\nREV. CORNELIUS F. O’LEARY: I will follow the good example of others and\r\nmerely submit it to the Society for publication. I may give you a\r\npreface though, showing forth the reason that led me, for I was in\r\nharmony with the great object of this Society, to trace the footsteps,\r\nof the Irish in America, and, as I am a resident of St. Louis, thought\r\nwell to bring forward the early history of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nThe Connors, the McKnights and the Bradys, they were foremost in\r\neverything. The first man to open a hotel in St. Louis was a man named\r\nBrady. The first man to publish a newspaper west of the Mississippi was\r\nan Irishman named Charless. The first man to open an English speaking\r\nschool in that French village was an Irishman. The Irishmen were\r\nprominent in everything.\r\n\r\nI hope you will find this paper interesting. I will not take the time to\r\nread it now, but will submit it this evening to Judge Lee.[2]\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: The next paper is by M. R. F. McCarthy, Esq., of\r\nBinghamton, N. Y., entitled “A Little Mosaic of the Life of Henry W.\r\nGrady.”[3]\r\n\r\nJUDGE LEE: Mr. McCarthy is not here, but has sent me his paper. I have\r\nno authority from Mr. McCarthy to read the same, but, if agreeable to\r\nyourself and the members of the Society, after approval by the Executive\r\nCouncil, I move that it be printed.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: Those in favor of the motion signify by saying “aye”; those\r\nopposed “no.” The motion is carried.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: I desire to make mention at this time of an article by Hon.\r\nJoseph T. Lawless on Daniel Morgan of Cowpens. This article was prepared\r\nafter painstaking research by Judge Lawless, and should have been\r\npublished in the Journal of the Society of 1907. For some reason or\r\nother, it was omitted, but will now be published in Volume IX. in\r\naccordance with the desire of the Executive Council.\r\n\r\nScientific papers have already been received from Michael J. O’Brien,\r\nEsq., Thomas S. Lonergan, Hon. William J. Onahan and Hon. Patrick T.\r\nBarry, and papers are promised and now in process of preparation by Rev.\r\nWilliam J. McCoy, LL. D., Michael J. O’Brien, Esq., Hon. Michael P.\r\nKehoe, Hon. James F. Brennan (our Historiographer), Edgar Stanton\r\nMaclay, Esq., Prof. Andrew J. Hogan, Martin I. J. Griffin, Esq., Dr. J.\r\nLawton Hiers, Col. Alfred Moore Waddell, and Frank M. Coffee, Jr.\r\n\r\nYou see, gentlemen, there is no paucity now of literary material. We\r\nsimply can’t stop the flood.\r\n\r\nThe next order of business is the reading of obituaries. The first is\r\nthat of Rev. Daniel H. O’Dwyer, by Chairman John J. Lenehan of the\r\nMembership Committee. The same has been submitted and will be published\r\nin Volume IX.\r\n\r\nThe next is that of Mr. Patrick O’Brien, which, after its reading by the\r\nSecretary-General, will be ordered published.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary-General read the sketch.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: The next is the obituary of Rev. Michael Aloysius McManus,\r\nby James L. O’Neill, Esq.\r\n\r\nJUDGE LEE: Doubtless many of us who were present at our annual meeting\r\nin Washington last year will remember Father McManus. His soul was so in\r\nthe work that he didn’t wait to be proposed, but proposed himself at\r\nthat meeting. The obituary notice is here, and has been well prepared by\r\none of the members of the Executive Council, Mr. James L. O’Neill. With\r\nyour permission, we will follow the usual course and publish the same in\r\nVolume IX.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: Very well. The next is that of Mr. Philip C. Walsh by\r\nPhilip C. Walsh, Jr.\r\n\r\nJUDGE LEE: Mr. Philip C. Walsh, Jr., is not a member of the Society, but\r\nhas sent me an obituary notice of his father which is quite complete.\r\nThe same will take the usual course.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: The next is the obituary of Mr. James McGovern by John G.\r\nO’Keefe. I understand the same is to be turned over to the\r\nSecretary-General for publication.\r\n\r\nThe next order of business is the reading of letters of regret by the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\n\r\nCommunications were then read by the Secretary-General from\r\nEx-President-General Edward A. Moseley, Hon. William A. Prendergast,\r\nRev. Dr. John J. McCoy, John F. Harty, Esq., Hon. Martin J. Wade, Dr. J.\r\nLawton Hiers, Hon. M. F. Kennedy, John Wood, Esq., James H. Devlin,\r\nEsq., Thomas F. Kailkenny, Esq., John H. Maloney, Esq., Daniel Hanrahan,\r\nEsq., Rev. Edmond Heelan, Anthony McOwen, Esq., Vice-President James\r\nThompson, Vice-President Thomas J. Lynch, Hon. Patrick T. Barry, Rt.\r\nRev. Phillip G. Garrigan, D. D., Hon. Patrick E. C. Lally, M. P. Tully,\r\nEsq., Dr. George McAleer, Hon. T. P. Linehan and others.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: The next in order, gentlemen, is the unfinished business.\r\n\r\nJUDGE LEE: There is none.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: Any new business?\r\n\r\nJUDGE LEE: None.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: There is a communication here that I would like you to take\r\nhome for consideration:\r\n\r\n“Members and guests will assemble in this room, which will be rearranged\r\nfor a reception room, at 6.30 p. m. A ladies’ room across the hall has\r\nbeen prepared, and a gentlemen’s room a few doors down. Attendants of\r\nthe hotel under the direction of the Reception Committee will wait upon\r\nthe members and guests, and until seven a reception by the officers to\r\nmembers and guests will be held under the direction of the Reception\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n“Dinner will be served at seven promptly in the Grand Banquet Hall.\r\nSeating lists have been provided and will be distributed at the\r\nreception, so that each member and guest may know where he is to sit.\r\nApplicants for tickets received today will be seated by the Reception\r\nCommittee to the best of its ability. Dinner tickets of members and\r\nguests will be taken up by the hotel attendants at the entrance to the\r\nGrand Banquet Hall.”\r\n\r\nBefore we adjourn, I want to ask Mr. Michael J. Corbett, one of our\r\nmembers, to say a word.\r\n\r\nMR. CORBETT: Gentlemen, I am glad to have been here today. I have\r\nenjoyed all the papers that have been read, and have no doubt I shall\r\nenjoy the banquet later in the evening.\r\n\r\nMotion made and seconded that the meeting adjourn.\r\n\r\nDR. QUINLAN: This closes the scientific meeting of the American-Irish\r\nHistorical Society, and I declare it adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ANNUAL BANQUET.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: Ladies and Gentlemen and Honored Guests, in\r\nthe name of the American-Irish Historical Society, I bid you welcome to\r\nour city and to the Twelfth Annual Banquet of our Society.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year, some events have crowded into the history of the\r\nIrish people in this country that give thrill and romance to the race.\r\nOne feature that is preëminent, and one that stands vividly before us as\r\nif yesterday, was the pageant on the land and sea of the Hudson-Fulton\r\ncelebration. That grand occasion, ladies and gentlemen, brought forth in\r\nthis city and its environs a multitude of people who have come to honor\r\nthe men who have placed their names in American history and who have\r\nperpetuated its grandeur. The conditions surrounding this great event\r\nare only too well known to you, and it would be like bringing coals to\r\nNewcastle were I to burden your memory by referring to that occasion.\r\n\r\nTonight we have assembled to commemorate an event in the history of this\r\nSociety. Some twelve years ago, in the city of Boston, a call was sent\r\nout by the late Secretary-General of this organization to some men in\r\nthe outlying cities and suburban towns to assemble and organize a\r\nsociety that would correct the wrong that had been done the\r\nAmerican-Irish or Irish-American, and make known what they had achieved.\r\nThe history of our country has oft been written by men of English blood,\r\nand it was the purpose of that body that was assembled to correct\r\nerroneous impressions and give color, feature and dignity to the men who\r\nhave made it possible for us to enjoy the beautiful flag of our Union.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nThis Society is essentially American because its interests are coupled\r\nwith the defence of the flag, and we have everything in common with the\r\ncommunity of our great nation. It is Irish because its sons and\r\ngrandsons have made their weight felt in every walk of life, and are\r\ncommemorating the conditions that were given to them by their sires. It\r\nis historic because it is our pleasure, our pride and our privilege to\r\nrecord the achievements of Irishmen in every walk of life, and to make\r\nthem better known in the history of today and in the history to come,\r\nand to give force and color and emphasis to what they have done for our\r\nRepublic. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAs this is an historical body, it may be my privilege tonight to refer\r\noccasionally to manuscript, in order that every word uttered by the\r\nexecutive may bear the imprint of record. Sustained as I am on both\r\nsides by the law and the Church, I could not otherwise but give\r\nutterance to that which emanates from and has been conceived by people\r\nwho have toiled and wrought and developed a condition and a color that\r\nhas stood out for what is right.\r\n\r\nWith the inception of our country, Irishmen have been ever foremost to\r\nproclaim their allegiance—from Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who\r\ndedicated his life and fortune to the cause of Independence, to the\r\nhumblest wage-earner who contributes his quota, from the bleak shores of\r\nAlaska to the Mexican Gulf. They have added lustre to Columbia’s\r\nCoronet, and in the womb of the unborn future they will continue their\r\nunswerving devotion to the cause of Freedom.\r\n\r\nThis is the youngest historical daughter of Erin in America. It has been\r\nsuckled at the breasts of the Mother Irish Societies here, many of whom\r\nare older than the very country itself. It has grown and matured because\r\nit was sustained by a spirit of justice, and it has lived and prospered\r\nunder the sheltering influence of the Stars and Stripes.\r\n\r\nOur fathers sought this country as an asylum from the tyranny and\r\nmisrule of England, and they builded far better than they knew. For the\r\npast two hundred years, they were deprived of every condition, social\r\nand educational, that belonged to a country whose civilization at one\r\ntime had illumined the world. The pages of Irish history for the past\r\nseven hundred years present little else than sorrow, privation and\r\noppression. During the past two hundred years, Irishmen have come to\r\nColumbia’s open arms, and they have not been unworthy of her tender care\r\nand affection. We stand here tonight entrenched behind the history of\r\nour past, and Ireland’s sons and daughters have taken their place in the\r\nhousehold of America, and we will strive to be worthy of the position\r\nassigned to us in her family.\r\n\r\nI am pleased to announce that the past year has witnessed industrial and\r\neducational changes in the Emerald Isle. One-half of the present\r\noccupiers of the land have purchased the ground outright (Applause) and\r\nthe division of the untenanted pasture lands among the people has\r\nstimulated thrift and neatness, as well as increased production, whilst\r\nthe Irish trade-mark has protected its home industries. Home Rule\r\nagitation has strengthened the position of Mr. Redmond and vindicated\r\nhis Parliamentary activity. The prospects for Home Rule in Ireland,\r\nwhether from the tariff reform or from the Conservatives or Free Trade\r\nLiberals, are now brighter than they have been since the year 1885.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HONORABLE THOMAS F. GILROY,\r\n\r\n  Far Rockaway, Queen’s County, New York.\r\n\r\n  Formerly Mayor of New York City.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is not my thought, in this prefatory address, to invade the province\r\nof subsequent speakers, but rather to introduce to you in a modest way\r\nour position as an historical body in this great nation. The gentlemen\r\nwho will follow me will give you detailed accounts of our activity and\r\nstrength in this country, whereas it is my humble part to explain our\r\nexistence and ratify our importance as one of the races that make up\r\nthis glorious Republic. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe know no creed except the Sermon on the Mount; no race but the\r\ncommunity of honest purpose; no politics but those which serve for the\r\nbetterment of mankind. We want our record from the voyage of Brendan,\r\nwho antedated Columbus nine hundred and fifty years, to this country,\r\ndown to the invention of Brennan of the monorail, inscribed upon the\r\npages of history as products of Irish thought and ingenuity.\r\n\r\nI will take a minute, if I may, to explain in a digressional way what I\r\nhave alluded to in my last sentence. Mr. Louis Brennan, inventor of the\r\nBrennan torpedo and the Brennan monorail, of which he recently gave a\r\nsuccessful exhibition in London, was born in Castlebar, County Mayo,\r\nIreland. He was, from 1887 to 1896, superintendent of the Government\r\nBrennan Torpedo Factory, of which he is at present the consulting\r\nengineer. The first monorail for commercial purposes will soon be in\r\noperation in the city of New York. Mr. Brennan estimates that it can\r\neasily attain a speed of 140 miles an hour, and that danger is\r\npractically negative.\r\n\r\nYour Presidents-General, from Admiral Meade to Admiral McGowan, have\r\nbeen men who have stood for the great ideals of this country. Their\r\nlabors in this Society have been crowned with success, and those of this\r\ngroup of executives who have been removed by the hand of Death can look\r\nfrom their exalted places tonight and feel proud of their meritorious\r\nwork. They have erected the edifice; it is only left for us to maintain\r\nthe structure. The work of this Society would be like a “Rope of Sand,”\r\nas my friend Clarke would say, unless we perpetuate our traditions and\r\nrealize the anticipations of our forefathers.\r\n\r\nThis Society needs a Chapter in every State of the Union, where\r\nsemi-annual meetings should be held for the purpose of reading\r\nhistorical papers, and at the same time to draw closer and closer\r\ntogether our people. Bring your sons into our Society that they, too,\r\nmay enjoy the glorious association of our kinsfolk. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency, however, among the young people (and this I say\r\nwith regret) to regard anything Irish as unstylish and, perhaps, a\r\ntrifle low. Now, such thoughts must be eliminated by their presence and\r\ncoöperation with us, and their participation in all our allied\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nMy work among you has been a labor of love. The administration has been\r\nably seconded in all its efforts, and the Membership Committee, headed\r\nby its indefatigable captain, has regenerated our Society by its\r\ncolossal work. In two years our forces have been increased to nearly one\r\nthousand members (Applause) and the Society has benefited numerically\r\nand intellectually, as well as financially.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact, that, in the event of death, either by illness\r\nor accident, of the Great Father of our Country, it was his express wish\r\nthat the command of the Continental Army should be given to General John\r\nSullivan. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThat seven of the sixteen generals in that same army were Irishmen or\r\nIrishmen’s sons. That Commission No. 1 in the Continental Navy was given\r\nto Jack Barry of the City of Wexford. (Applause.) That the first naval\r\nvictory of the Revolution on the high seas was won by Maurice O’Brien of\r\nMaine and his seven sons (Lexington of the Seas). (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThat four months before a shot was fired at Lexington, proclaiming the\r\nWar of Independence, a handful of patriots, mostly Irish boys, led by\r\nJohn Sullivan of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, overpowered an English\r\ngarrison at Newcastle and captured guns and ammunition that were used\r\nwith deadly effect at Bunker Hill. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIt was said this afternoon at our scientific gathering by one familiar\r\nwith the subject that the finest lot of books that ever came into\r\nAmerica at one time was presented to Yale College by Bishop Berkeley of\r\nCloyne, Ireland, and formed the nucleus of its great library. That\r\nThomas Dongan, Earl of Limerick, as Governor of New York, gave the\r\nColony its first great Charter in 1683; and that twelve of the signers\r\nof the Declaration of Independence were Irishmen or men of Irish\r\nextraction.\r\n\r\nWireless telegraphy owes its discovery to the son of a Dublin mother,\r\nsteam navigation to a son of Erin, and the great Erie Canal—it ought to\r\nbe the Erin Canal—to the descendant of a Celt. Through the bodies of\r\neight presidents of our Nation coursed Irish blood, and many of the\r\ngifted dramatists and actors of our country have come from gentle Irish\r\nstock; whilst editors and literateurs have been pleased to call their\r\ninspiration purely Celtic. Fortified by such forces in the past, we are\r\nhere tonight to blow life into the mummified historians of our day, and\r\nto awaken in them the honest motto of our Society, “That the World may\r\nknow.” (Applause.)\r\n\r\nGeorge II had reason to say: “Cursed be the laws that deprived me of\r\nthese subjects,” and how George III could re-echo these fateful words\r\nafter his unjust taxation upon the early colonists is to be marvelled\r\nat; but the Irish were here then, as they are here now, ready to avenge\r\nto the hills their treasured wrongs.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose on such an occasion as this to dim your eyes or\r\nsadden your thoughts with unhappy reflections, but custom holds me to a\r\nstrict account; therefore a befitting allusion to our departed brothers\r\nis not out of place, and such an omission would indeed be culpable.\r\n\r\nOur ranks have been depleted during the past year by the Great Leveller.\r\nMany of these we could ill afford to lose, but, by Divine Command, they\r\nhave gone where, with watchful eyes, they will continue to follow us in\r\nspirit. Let us be worthy of the heritage they have given us, and when\r\nwe, too, part company from those we love, let it be said of us as it is\r\nsaid of them, “They are absent but not forgotten.” (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe band will now play the “Star Spangled Banner,” and I will propose a\r\ntoast to the President of our Nation, William H. Taft. (Toast drunk\r\nstanding.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: Ladies and gentlemen, you will kindly be\r\nseated. We are only upon the threshold as yet, we shall soon invade the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nIn my enthusiasm I forgot, in the opening part of my speech, to thank\r\nthe men who have elected me for the third time to the presidency of this\r\ngreat Society.\r\n\r\nI want the women here tonight to take this matter up with these\r\nderelicts—I won’t say whether it is father, husband or son. You see\r\nmothers are always before me, and I can’t get away from the mental\r\npicture as well as the physical one. But the women can do much good.\r\nLook what they have done tonight! If you could stand here and see this\r\nbeautiful picture, effulgent with everything lovely, it seems that the\r\nflowers and shrubs of Paradise have been sent down here in order to give\r\ncolor and radiance to this picture! And then the inspiration—Mr.\r\nCrimmins says a feast in itself.\r\n\r\nNow I want the good women to talk about the American-Irish Historical\r\nSociety, to boom it, so to speak, and I feel confident that much good\r\nwill be accomplished through their efforts.\r\n\r\nI am going to ask the Secretary-General to read one or two\r\ncommunications from absent members, and we will go through this\r\nprogramme like Paderewski does with his touch on the piano.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY-GENERAL LEE: Mr. President—\r\n\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nLadies and Gentlemen of the American-Irish Historical Society, I thank\r\nyou sincerely. At the direction of the President-General, I have three\r\ncommunications to read. The first is from our fellow member, Mr. Victor\r\nHerbert. It is a telegram to the President-General:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             “NEW YORK, January 8, 1910.\r\n\r\n  “DR. FRANCIS J. QUINLAN,\r\n      “President-General American-Irish Historical Society,\r\n          “New York City.\r\n\r\n  “Am prevented from being present tonight on account of attack of\r\n  tonsilitis, confining me to residence. Wish fellow members and guests\r\n  a right good time.\r\n\r\n                                                       “VICTOR HERBERT.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe next two are letters from ex-United States Senator William E.\r\nChandler, who is Vice-President of the Society for New Hampshire:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       “CONCORD, N.

I find I\r\n  shall not be able to attend the meeting of Saturday; but if I can be\r\n  of service to you in Concord or Washington it will give me pleasure to\r\n  do so.\r\n\r\n                                      “Very truly,\r\n                                                      “WM.

CHANDLER.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI move you, Mr. President, Mr. Kelley’s election as a member of this\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: You have heard the motion that Mr. John W.\r\nKelley be elected a member of the American-Irish Historical Society.\r\nThose in favor say “aye,” those opposed “nay.” Mr. Kelley is unanimously\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: It is necessary that you give your undivided\r\nattention to the next speaker. He is the financial agent, or, rather\r\ntrust president of our corporate body. Mr. Dooley has been associated\r\nwith the American-Irish Historical Society for many years. You all know\r\nJudge Lee, because he is in touch with you constantly upon the various\r\nmatters that concern our Society, whether historical or social; but Mr.\r\nDooley has so little occasion to remind you of your obligations, as the\r\nwave of financial return sweeps into him without any reminder from his\r\noffice. He is quiet, modest and dignified, like a great many of our New\r\nEnglanders.\r\n\r\nNow, within the borders of that section of New England—notice New\r\n“England,”—it is now nearly New “Ireland,”—Mr. Dooley represents one of\r\nthe largest moneyed organizations in the City of Providence. And he is\r\nso proud of his Irish blood that sometimes I am fearful lest he be\r\novertaken with a patriotic seizure; his enthusiasm seems to know no\r\nbounds. We will now hear him in his own plain, honest words. I have the\r\npleasure of presenting to you the Treasurer-General of our Society, Hon.\r\nMichael F. Dooley.\r\n\r\n(Band plays “Oh, Mr. Dooley” amid hearty applause.)\r\n\r\nTREASURER-GENERAL DOOLEY: This is not the first time I have been greeted\r\nwith that song, and, while the voices here tonight have been exceedingly\r\ndelightful to listen to, I can’t help thinking of a criticism that was\r\nonce passed by the _New York Sun_ upon the “Boston Ideals,” who had been\r\nsinging English opera, and had done it splendidly. They came to New York\r\ndetermined to enter the field of Italian opera, and the morning\r\nfollowing their first night the _Sun_, in its criticism, started in by\r\nsaying: “Ideals rush in where artists fear to tread.” I congratulate you\r\nupon the song; you sang it so well.\r\n\r\nI regret very much that an imperfect memory makes it necessary for me to\r\nread this paper to you, but its brevity, I hope, will make good what it\r\notherwise lacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 AN UNSOLVED PHASE OF AMERICAN HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hoary and honored dictum that “History is a conspiracy against\r\ntruth” is like the cry of David in his desolation calling all men liars.\r\nThere is food for meditation in the two utterances, and candor compels\r\nthe admission that the world believes there is more than a modicum of\r\njustification for them both.\r\n\r\nAnd this reminds me that a meeting of the American Historical Society\r\nwas held at New York a few days ago at which Professor Albert Bushnell\r\nHart of Harvard, an authority of high repute, and a man of great\r\ncritical judgment and learning, delivered an address on “Imagination in\r\nHistory.” He told his hearers among many other things well worth\r\nremembering, that “even historical scholars are not without their\r\nfailings, their prejudices and their falsehoods.”\r\n\r\nNow, while the discovery is not new, the announcement of it has never\r\nfound more forceful expression or been backed by a more expert\r\nopinion—and it is of more than passing interest to our Society whose\r\ncardinal principle is “to make better known the Irish Chapter in\r\nAmerican History.” It emphasizes the usefulness and necessity of this\r\nand kindred organizations to make straight the crooked ways, to save\r\nfrom obscurity the names and deeds of those who achieved, and if they do\r\nnot live, to have live in our country’s annals the Irishmen and the sons\r\nof Irishmen worthy of the honor.\r\n\r\nIn the days before the Christian era and for long after, it was not an\r\ninfrequent practice for the Roman people to deify their great men and\r\nerect temples in their honor, worship at their shrines, and pay\r\nreverence to their memory. Among those to whom such honors were paid\r\nwere deities of Greek origin, who had been adopted by the Romans, either\r\nunder their own names or under others that equally as well served; but\r\nthey were always Romans, their origin being obscured or totally ignored.\r\nThis custom has not been unknown among the moderns, and should a general\r\napotheosis occur in our country, it is but fair that among the shrines\r\nin the temple some few be reserved, if they deserve it, for that people\r\nwho contributed at least 5,000,000 souls, living, creative and creating\r\nto the growth and greatness of the land.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to enter upon the social, political and religious\r\nconditions which brought to these shores in mid-colonial times, a\r\nconsiderable number of Irish, whose identity became merged in the great\r\nmass of the people. I speak of it only to note the fact that there was\r\nsuch an immigration, and that the influence of this stranger people upon\r\nthe habits and character of the colonists must have been felt in some\r\ndegree, however insignificant, in the communities in which they and the\r\nIrish dwelt together. For, in the lapse of time by intermarriage and the\r\ndaily routine of life, whether as master and servant, landholder and\r\ntenant, or husband and wife, there could not fail to come a slow,\r\nperhaps, but sure blending of qualities and characteristics that\r\ninfluenced the evolution and development of the American man as we find\r\nhim in certain parts of the South at the time of the Revolution. This\r\nintermixture of races can be readily understood as not difficult of\r\naccomplishment when it is recalled that they both spoke the same tongue,\r\nand were generally in large part of the same religion if not of the same\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Revolution many of those belonging to this\r\nemigrant class, or their sons, had risen to prominence and already made\r\nthemselves felt in the trade and commerce of their communities, or had\r\nbecome land owners of importance.\r\n\r\nWith rare exceptions they ardently sympathized with their fellow\r\ncolonists in their aspirations for liberty, and a very large number of\r\nthem enlisted in the American army.\r\n\r\nThe war gave further impetus to Irish immigration for reasons easily\r\ndivined, and so marked were their numbers in Washington’s forces that at\r\nthe close of the conflict, in an investigation by the English Parliament\r\ninto the causes and conduct of the war, it was said by some of the\r\nwitnesses that the Irish in no small degree contributed to the loss of\r\nthe colonies by the mother country. When I put it in this form I modify\r\nmaterially the testimony of some of the witnesses who flatly declared\r\nthat it was the Irish who won the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThis to me has always appeared to be an exaggerated statement,\r\nparticularly when I read the roster of the Sons of the Revolution—for\r\neither nearly all the Irish were killed in action or died soon after—or\r\npossibly there has been some legerdemain in the nomenclature of the\r\nsurvivors. But that there were some Irish in the Revolutionary forces\r\nwho fought well and died, history has recorded, and American historians\r\nhave admitted it, but have not chronicled the fact with any wealth of\r\ndetail or enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAs the eighteenth century ended, the Irish began coming hitherward in\r\ngreater force than had marked the preceding years, and continued coming\r\nin increasing volume during the succeeding fifty years, until about\r\n1847, when their numbers grew enormously. From that time on, until 1890,\r\nimmigration statistics show that about 4,000,000 Irish came to America,\r\nwhich is one of the greatest race movements, if not the greatest in the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of this great exodus from Ireland, with the\r\nexception of that period during which the Alien and Sedition laws were\r\npassed and repealed, the Irish had grown into the fibre and woof of the\r\nnation with slight friction and with little open objection, but when\r\nevery port of our eastern shore became a haven for ship after ship\r\nbringing emigrants from Ireland, the country paused and wondered. But\r\nthey came and continued to come until wonder turned to anxiety, which\r\nwas but a step from hostile alarm, and this eventually took shape in the\r\nformation of patriotic societies all over the thickly settled parts of\r\nthe country, for the purpose of having laws passed restricting\r\nimmigration and the granting of political rights. This situation was\r\nfurther complicated by the great mass of the invaders being unlettered\r\nand untrained in the common avocations of life, whether as tillers of\r\nthe soil, mechanics, or clerks.\r\n\r\nAs we look back to the events of that period, it is not surprising that\r\nthe people already here viewed with aversion and fear the presence of\r\nthis vast army of aliens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HONORABLE THOMAS F. WALSH.\r\n\r\n  Of Denver and Washington.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for Colorado.\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1909.\r\n\r\n  By J. Knowles Bishop.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of assimilating this large influx of Irish, even if\r\nassimilation had been desired, and the possibility of the Irish\r\neventually assimilating their not entirely voluntary hosts were\r\nquestions that deeply moved men of earnest convictions, but perhaps of\r\nlimited vision.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it was just about this epoch that histories of an\r\nambitious and standard character began to be written, and some taking on\r\nthe passions of the time and the prejudices of the author’s environment,\r\nhave not given the Irish the place that their services and devotion to\r\nthe country’s welfare entitled them to hold. It is further to be\r\ndeplored that full recovery from the bitterness of those days has not\r\nbeen hastened by incidents growing out of political and other\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nEven today, when calm, cold reason has had had time to resume her sway,\r\nit is largely magazine writers who are delving into the historic past,\r\nand presenting to the people a panorama of national life which displays\r\nupon its unfolding roll, not only the original settlers and their\r\ndescendants, but also the pioneer Irish and their sons who had their\r\npart in the upbuilding and maintenance of the nation. But the healing\r\ntouch of time will change, let us hope, if it does not entirely cure,\r\nthat obliquity of vision which distorts much that it sees or fails to\r\nsee that which it may not distort.\r\n\r\nWhen some full, adequate chronicle comes to be written of the Irish race\r\nmovement to this country due consideration will be given to the\r\ninfluence it has had on the manners and customs of the country, and it\r\nwill not be complete if it takes not into account the contributions of\r\nbrawn and brain, labor and energy that it has given to our national\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe versatility of talent and the buoyancy of spirit and the native wit\r\nand humor which distinguish this people, have diffused themselves\r\nthrough American life and infused themselves into it, softening its\r\nsevere, rigid lines, and helping to lift the gloom, that often concealed\r\nthe splendid qualities of the Puritan whose spirit has spread over the\r\nland carrying to its uttermost limits the blessings of self government\r\nand radiating an influence for the uplift of mankind.\r\n\r\nWhile I am on this subject, permit me to digress for a moment, to speak\r\nof a thing which is, perhaps, outside the range of this paper, and that\r\nis the insensible, subtle change that I believe the Irish have wrought\r\nin our Eastern section in the voice and accent of the descendants of the\r\nfirst settlers. The sharp nasal tone, so common half a century ago, has\r\nalmost entirely disappeared in the cities and is fast disappearing in\r\nthe country. This is probably due in great measure to the fact that most\r\nof the immigrant Irish brought with them the rich, rare brogue of their\r\nfatherland, and the others the cultivated voice of the educated\r\nIrishman, both full of music and “sweet as the dying note of a broken\r\nharp string”—a music, whose soft, pervasive tones have added an\r\nindescribable charm to the spoken word that the stern hills of New\r\nEngland rarely knew, but which in time they have felt the touch of.\r\nToday it is difficult to tell the origin of the speaker, whether he be a\r\ntenth generation Puritan or a second generation Irish, in communities\r\nwhere the latter abound.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this paper is general and not personal, and for that reason\r\nI have not gone through the gamut of names of Irish origin whose owners\r\nmerited well of the country. Their fame is secure and permanent—and\r\nwhile in some instances overshadowed and lost sight of through the\r\nneglect, or let us call it the caprice, of the historian—it is safe.\r\n\r\nIts single purpose has been to fathom the causes of the total or partial\r\neclipse of a great body of people whose achievements entitle them to\r\nshine among the greater or lesser luminaries of this Republic, if not\r\namong the greatest.\r\n\r\nTo repair the injustice and the cruel omissions of history, is a noble\r\nmission and as patriotic as any that ever moved men to deeds of valor\r\nand sacrifice. It is not for us to keep alive the memory of those who\r\nhave their place in the imperishable annals of our country—but it is for\r\nus to rescue from oblivion the men that lived and worked and wrought,\r\nwhom historical writers by accident, indifference or design, have\r\nignored in their researches, or buried in a foot note at the bottom of a\r\npage.\r\n\r\nIf we do this, we do not come together in vain.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: This “squib” appeared in last night’s paper,\r\nand was handed to me this afternoon: “The man who writes a poem does so\r\nunder reasonably safe conditions. Nothing more dangerous than a\r\nbean-blower is apt to be used against him; lemons and vegetables may\r\ncome his way, but this is the worst, save the scorn of the critics. But\r\nthe McDonalds and McAdoos lived in the underground; they met irate\r\nlandlords and the general ‘cussedness’ of inanimate things, all with\r\nsmiling patience and invincible courage.”\r\n\r\nThe McDonalds and the McAdoos are famous in the annals of Irish history.\r\nSome of the McAdoos have lived and toiled under the ground; others have\r\nexisted in the open. From the humblest walk of life to the highest\r\nposition, next to the chamber of the Executive, one of your officials\r\nhas risen. It is like naming a member of his own household to his family\r\nto present your illustrious ex-President-General, Hon. William McAdoo.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM MCADOO: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I fear that\r\nsometimes many of the elements that go to make up the very cosmopolitan\r\npopulation of our country think that we of the American-Irish Historical\r\nSociety are too insistent upon the part which our people played in the\r\nformative period of the Republic.\r\n\r\nNow we have an affectionate feeling towards our Motherland because she\r\nmuch needs the help of her children. If Ireland were a great and\r\npowerful country, like Germany, rich with an army and navy of its own,\r\nwith its ambassadors and representatives in every land and with its\r\ngreat universities spreading German ideas among the people; if Ireland\r\nhad all those accessories she would have made her claims felt in the\r\nhistory of the United States without the need of societies like this;\r\nbut Ireland, “Erin, the isle of sorrows,” is an unfortunate country,\r\nsubjugated, impoverished, despoiled and misrepresented and when,\r\ntherefore, the membership of this Society, these gentlemen who have\r\ngiven to it such unselfish labor, discovered the errors and mistakes and\r\nthe indifference and sometimes the prejudices of historians of the\r\nUnited States in regard to Ireland in America, as so well pointed out by\r\nMr. Dooley, they organized this Society for the purpose of doing justice\r\nto those brave Irish men and virtuous women who came here, especially\r\nprior to the Revolution, and who did so much to make this a great and\r\nfree country.\r\n\r\nNow the trouble with most of us Irish Americans—I am Irish in the first\r\ndegree, having been born in Ireland while most of you are probably only\r\nsecond-class Irish or even third or fourth—is that when we are serious\r\nand in deep earnest we are taken to be play acting, and when we are\r\njocose or humorous and contributing to the “gaiety of nations” we are\r\ntaken to be most in earnest. It is hard for an Anglo-Saxon to understand\r\nan Irish Celt. One of the greatest difficulties between England and\r\nIreland is the fact that the mental attitude of the two races is far\r\napart, the intellectual agility of the one and the slow, if certain,\r\nprocesses of the other are obvious to any one acquainted with both\r\ncountries. Let me illustrate it by a little story:\r\n\r\nThere was a party at an English country house, and they had been passing\r\na rather dull English winter afternoon by proposing and guessing at\r\nriddles; and finally one of the guests turned to the host and said, “Sir\r\nCharles, why don’t you propose a riddle?” He said, “Really, now, I’m not\r\nhalf clever enough to do such a thing as that. I couldn’t really do it,\r\ndon’t-cher-know.” “Well, you might try; you don’t know what you can do.”\r\nFinally Sir Charles said, “Well, it stands on one leg and it has\r\nfeathers and it barks like a dog.” So they all guessed and guessed,\r\neverything in the animal and vegetable kingdom, and they finally gave it\r\nup; and Sir Charles said, “Why, really, I had no idea I was so clever; I\r\nthought you would easily guess it”; and they said, “It is impossible to\r\nguess.” And he said, “Well, that’s easy; it’s a stork.” “Well,” they\r\nexclaimed, “but surely, Sir Charles, a stork doesn’t bark.” And Sir\r\nCharles replied, “Well, that’s the cleverest part of it; I put that in\r\nto make it hard.”\r\n\r\nAnd when we come to our Scotch friends we can readily understand how\r\nhard it is for a Scotchman to thoroughly comprehend an Irishman. A\r\nfriend of mine was telling this story in Glasgow to the Board of Trade\r\nat its annual dinner: He said an Irishman was coming down the Bowery in\r\nNew York late one night and met a policeman, and he said to him, “What\r\ntime is it?” and the policeman replied, “It’s two o’clock.” And the\r\nIrishman said, “I’m a bit deaf and I didn’t hear you; would you mind\r\nrepeating it?” and the policeman yelled at him, “It’s two o’clock.”\r\n“Very queer,” says the Irishman, “but really I didn’t hear you. Would\r\nyou mind saying it again?” and thereupon the policeman (one of my former\r\ncompanions in arms) took his constitution-preserving stick and hit him\r\non one side of the head and said “One,” and then he hit him a clip on\r\nthe other side of the head and said “Two.” “Did you hear me that time?”\r\n“I did, begorra, and I’m glad I didn’t meet you at twelve.”\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, a Scotchman by descent, told that story to the Glasgow\r\nBoard of Trade, and there sat those Scotchman in solemn black around the\r\nfestive board, and there wasn’t a smile in the room. And finally one old\r\nScotchman, by way of defending the storyteller, said, “Weel, now, I\r\ndinna blame the policeman so much; it’s very aggravating to be asked the\r\nsame question so often.”\r\n\r\nNow this Society was formed, among other things, for the purpose of\r\nclearing up the underbrush in American history, or, in other words,\r\n“laying” the Scotch-Irish ghost. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThere was a ghost in my native county of Donegal called the “Fanad\r\nGhost.” It was said to have been raised by a free mason skilled in the\r\n“Black Art” while in an hilarious mood, but after it was up the mason\r\ncouldn’t put it down and the ghost began throwing things around—the\r\ndelft on the dresser, the noggins, the pots, the stones on the\r\nchimney—pulling out the scobes in the thatch on the roof, and raising\r\nCain generally. The Presbyterian minister came in and prayed until he\r\nhad corns on his knees, and the ghost took a day off. The Catholic\r\npriest was called in and did the best he could, and the ghost acted\r\n“dacintly” for two days, at the end of which time he was more vigorous\r\nthan ever. Well, finally they sent to the city of Derry and got a\r\ndelegation of free masons, and they labored one week, night and day—with\r\nrefreshments—and at last one morning, when the refreshments were running\r\nlow, the head mason came to the door with perspiration streaming off his\r\nface and his legs wobbly, and said, “Get a black cock without a white\r\nfeather and another keg of Charley Oge’s poteen, and with the help of\r\nHeaven we’ll lay him before morning.” And as the last crow went of the\r\ncock and the last drop out of the keg the Fanad Ghost was laid forever\r\nwith a whiff of sulphur up the chimney and a trembling of the kitchen\r\nfloor. (Laughter and applause.)\r\n\r\nAnd so this Society is looking for the white cock of Truth to crow soon\r\nover the Scotch-Irish ghost, for if ever there was a veritable ghost it\r\nis the Scotch-Irishman in America. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe “Scotch-Irishman” in America, Mr. Dooley has told us, had his\r\nhistoric origin about the time of the great famine period in Ireland,\r\nwhen almost one-half of the inhabitants of that unfortunate land,\r\nstarved, diseased and in rags, were huddled in cargo ships and treated\r\nworse than any negro slaves that ever came to this country. They died by\r\nthousands and strewed the bottom of the Atlantic with their bodies.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine in a thriving Western city the other night met a man\r\nwho is today one of the leading citizens in that place, and he said to\r\nmy friend, “I am the sole survivor of five of my family who came over in\r\nthose diseased and hellish ships in which England sent our people in the\r\nblack days of the famine. My sister and my brother lie in the unfathomed\r\ncaves of the Atlantic Ocean; my father and mother followed them. Twelve\r\nthousand of our race lie beneath the monument which the Ancient Order of\r\nHibernians have erected on Groose Isle in the St. Lawrence below\r\nQuebec.”\r\n\r\nAnd these unfortunate people, libelled before they landed, without\r\nmeans, without education, without knowledge of the people among whom\r\nthey came, were not received with open arms. The resulting Anti-Irish\r\nfeeling in the United States at that period has been most delicately and\r\ndiplomatically pointed out by Mr. Dooley tonight. Men and women\r\notherwise honest and unprejudiced stood appalled at the thought of\r\nnationally assimilating this wretchedness, and in that period the bitter\r\nprejudice against the Irish in America took root.\r\n\r\nIt was at this same time that American history began to take form, and\r\nthe omissions, which are as criminal as some of the things they tell,\r\ncrept into the books which our children read in school. And it is due to\r\nthose omissions, Gentlemen, that this grand, painstaking and\r\njustice-seeking Society was formed.\r\n\r\nIf ever you want to get the white cock of Truth to crow over the\r\nScotch-Irishman, take a look into the history of North Carolina. There\r\nis scarcely another state in America to which so many of the Northern\r\nIrish went before the Revolution as to North Carolina, and to no other\r\nstate before the Revolution did so many Scotchmen go.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Culloden, where the Scottish clans had so valiantly\r\nfought for Charles Edward, a number of them were given the privilege of\r\nleaving Great Britain and coming to America, first taking the oath of\r\nallegiance to the English crown. A great number of these broken clansmen\r\ncame to North Carolina and they were there at the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution; but they had been preceded by a large number of Protestant\r\nIrishmen from the Province of Ulster.\r\n\r\nIf the Scotchman who went to Ireland in 1610, and from that until the\r\nseventeenth century, if he still remained obdurately a Scotchman,\r\nbreaking the rule of all other races in Ireland, would he not have\r\nfraternized and made common cause with the Scotch people he met in the\r\nnew world? On the contrary, when the Revolution broke out the broken\r\nclansmen, the MacDonalds, the MacNeils, the MacIntoshes, and even Flora\r\nMacDonald herself, the great heroine of story and song, became the most\r\ndesperate loyalists and Torys in that state. They organized armies, they\r\nfought with courage and tenacity, and their leaders were guilty of\r\nhorrible atrocities in putting down the Northern Irish, who were all\r\npatriots and Whigs and who are now called the “Scotch-Irish.”\r\n\r\nThe Irishmen in North Carolina, largely Presbyterians in religion, were\r\nunanimously patriotic as Americans from the beginning, and they did not\r\nassimilate with the Scotchmen, who came direct from Scotland. Flora\r\nMacDonald, whose story we all know, her five sons and her husband,\r\nentered the British Army and continued throughout the Revolution; that\r\nis, such of them as were not taken prisoners and expatriated to Nova\r\nScotia, where her descendants are today most vigorous supporters of\r\nEnglish rule. Her husband was early taken a prisoner of war and confined\r\nat Halifax, Virginia, and in 1776 Flora went back to Scotland, where she\r\nwas afterwards rejoined by him.\r\n\r\nTo Worcester, Massachusetts, in the early Colonial days came three\r\nhundred Irishmen from the Province of Ulster, probably many from my own\r\ncounty of Donegal, to dwell among those ever hospitable and warm-hearted\r\ngentlemen, the Puritans. Here was a fine combination—a “Scotch Irish”\r\nPresbyterian meeting a Puritan, a Calvinistic Reunion! But how did they\r\nact when these three hundred men and women from Ulster arrived in\r\nMassachusetts? Perhaps some of you may think they were received with\r\ngreat hospitality. Well, they were not. They were received, says a\r\n“Scotch-Irish” historian, with marked aversion and bitter prejudice\r\nagainst them as being Irish. A gentleman writing in favor of the so\r\ncalled “Scotch Irish” in America says the New England colonists could\r\nnot differentiate these _Irish Protestants_, though they were different\r\nin religion from the mass of Irishmen. Is not that a delicious\r\nconfession in the papers of the Scotch Irish Society? The Puritans could\r\nnot understand that they were anything but Irish; they recognized them\r\nas such and did everything to make it unpleasant for them (and they were\r\nartists in that work), and to get them out of the community as soon as\r\nthey could, short of inviting a physical controversy, for looking at\r\nthese stalwart Irishmen they made up their minds if it came to a fight,\r\nthey could, in the language of the Bowery, put up a “peach” of a one.\r\n(Laughter and applause.)\r\n\r\nThe first man who died on the battlefield for American liberty, south of\r\nMason and Dixon’s line, was a great “Scotch-Irish” Anglo-Saxon named\r\nJohn Grady; and when Grady died the captain of his army, Thomas Gove, a\r\nfamily well known to any Donegal man, took off his sword and deposited\r\nit with the body of Grady as a mark of respect and love for so brave and\r\npatriotic a man.\r\n\r\nNow our great American historians, from Bancroft and Motley and Parkman\r\ndown to Henry Cabot Lodge, have quietly ignored the Irish in America, or\r\nhave given all the credit for their achievements to this myth, the\r\n“Scotch-Irishman.” It is a singular thing, when you read the things this\r\nSociety puts before you, the absolute facts of history, that no American\r\nhistorian of Anglo-American ancestry has had the fairness and the\r\ncourage and the sense of justice to do for Ireland what so many of them\r\nhave done for other nationalities.\r\n\r\nMr. Motley wrote a whole library about the Dutch Republic, constituting\r\na standard work among the Dutchmen of today of the history of their\r\npeople and achievements. Mr. Parkman’s history of the French in Canada\r\nis unexcelled. Even that good historian, Mr. John Fiske, never rose\r\nabove his environment; and I say it is no credit to American historians\r\nof the highest class that they have not seen fit to do justice to the\r\npatriotism, the sacrifices, the intellectual efforts and the financial\r\ncontributions which the great body of the Irish people made to secure\r\nliberty to the United States. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWouldn’t it have been a splendid and a generous thing if Motley had\r\nwritten a little of Ireland as he wrote of the Dutch Republic and the\r\nNew Netherlands; if Parkman had done for Ireland in this country what he\r\ndid for the French in Canada? And yet, from the earliest times, there\r\ncame an unending stream to this country from Ireland of the cream of its\r\nchivalry and virtue, courage, industry and intellect, and sacrificed it\r\nmost generously and without hope of reward at the altar of American\r\nliberty. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nBut the “Scotch-Irishman,” as considered, let us look at him. Now we\r\nwill never understand the history of the Irish in America unless we go\r\nback to Ireland. I have a lot of friends among Americans of other stocks\r\nwho undertake to appreciate the part the Irish have played in the\r\nupbuilding of this nation, but they can’t estimate it correctly unless\r\nthey know something of the history of Ireland itself.\r\n\r\nEvery race that came to Ireland was assimilated. The Danes came, and\r\nthose not driven to sea quickly became converted to Irish ideas. The\r\nNormans came, and they, too, became assimilated; and the Scotchmen came\r\nto Ireland, to the Plantation of Ulster, a subject too broad to be\r\ndiscussed now.\r\n\r\nCommencing in 1610 and from that on to the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, the Scotchman came to Ireland, and he hadn’t been there long\r\nbefore he became civilized, smoothed, rounded, the heart of him given\r\nfree play—in equality with the head; he joined the revolutionary\r\nsocieties such as the Irish had in those days, took pot shots at the\r\nlandlord, and cultivated a sense of humor, conspired against English\r\nrule, and, coming to America, became a most bitter Rebel and a valiant\r\nsoldier in Washington’s army.\r\n\r\nNow I intend, at the request of your worthy Ex-President, Mr. Crimmins,\r\nwho has done so much for this Society, to prepare some facts with\r\nreference to the settlement of Ulster, and what the immigrants from\r\nUlster did in America, especially in the Revolutionary War. And I assert\r\ntonight, without fear of contradiction from any historian, American or\r\nEnglish, that the blundering, unjust and criminal acts of England in\r\nIreland, and especially in the province of Ulster, did more to fill the\r\narmies of George Washington with brave soldiers than almost any other\r\ncause. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIf I were asked to point out one single thing that did more to make sure\r\nAmerican liberty than any other, I would speak of the tithing of the\r\nPresbyterians in the province of Ulster. When this colony had been\r\nplanted in Ulster on the “confiscated” lands of the O’Donnells and\r\nO’Neils and other septs, when these brave, intellectual, industrious,\r\nindependent Scotch Celts (for that is what the large majority of them\r\nwere) brought over to settle this province under promises not kept—and\r\nin this connection it should be remembered that these settlers had no\r\npart in the conspiracy of Sir Arthur Chichester and Sir John Davies and\r\nother English “Civilizers” and land grafters in despoiling the\r\nO’Donnells and O’Neils and minor Irish septs of 3,000,000 acres of the\r\nbest land in Ulster—were confronted with the test oath of Queen Anne\r\napplied to Catholics and Presbyterians alike, when they were compelled\r\nto pay tithes, the same being taken from their fields of wheat or the\r\ncorn from their barn, to support a church into which they would not\r\nenter in common with their Catholic fellow countrymen, upon emigrating\r\nto this country they became American Rebels on every battlefield in the\r\nUnited States. They came to the States before the Revolution in such\r\nnumbers that in one year twelve thousand Ulster Presbyterian Irish left\r\nthat province for American ports. The flow of immigration was so\r\ncontinued and so great in volume that it is a matter of record, which\r\nanyone can read in the State Papers, that the Presbyterian ministers of\r\nthe province of Ulster petitioned the King to stop the immigration by\r\nrepeal of obnoxious laws and alien injustice, or they would have no\r\ncongregations left in Ireland.\r\n\r\nYou can trace them today from Londonderry, N. H., and Dublin in the same\r\nstate, to Donegal in Pennsylvania, and down the whole Appalachian chain\r\ninto Florida; and everywhere you will find settlements and towns bearing\r\nthe good old Irish names and founded by these patriots, who stood by\r\nWashington and whose motto was, “No surrender to the British\r\nGovernment.” (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOn that subject alone I hope to be permitted, Mr. President, if I can\r\nfind the leisure, to present to this Society, with due historical\r\nreferences, the truth of history as regards that period.\r\n\r\nDuring the famine period that I spoke of there was a Cunard ship called\r\nthe “Cephelonia.” The “Cephelonia” was one of the most celebrated ships\r\nof the Cunard line, and, during the famine period, she brought great\r\nnumbers of Irish immigrants to Boston. One day not many years ago I was\r\ntalking to a couple of Irish American friends of mine in Boston, when a\r\nthird man came up and gave the time of day to my friend and passed on.\r\nOne of my friends turned to the other and said, “Is he a ‘Mayflower’?”\r\nand my friend replied, “No, he,” said he, “is a ‘Cephelonian.’ The\r\n‘Cephelonians’ now outnumber the ‘Mayflowers.’”\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, I am really trespassing on your good nature because I\r\nam keeping you from a great treat. I came here tonight and found my\r\ncountryman, McManus of Donegal, and then I found I had the honor of\r\nsitting next to a good man from County Tyrone (and next to Donegal\r\nTyrone is a good substitute), the Rev. Dr. Sheppard.\r\n\r\nAll I have to say in conclusion is this: I say to my American friends,\r\nwe are not seeking to inject a foreign story with foreign prejudices and\r\nold world bitterness into your history; we are not asking for any place\r\nin that history which we do not deserve; we are not asking you to\r\nsubvert the facts of American history; we are making no special plea for\r\nour nationality or our race; but we are demanding justice and we are\r\ngoing to get it.\r\n\r\nYou younger members will live to see the time when, a convention of\r\nhistorians being called in the city of New York, as was the other day,\r\nyour honored President will be invited to fill an enviable place in that\r\nconvocation; and when the heads of our great universities, when the men\r\nwho stand for the most learned in America, undertake to pass upon the\r\nhistorical phases of that period of our history from the beginning up to\r\n1860, Ireland and Irish men and women will be given their proper place.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe need no vindication after 1860. We vindicated our place in American\r\nhistory on every battlefield of the Civil War. We were at Bull Run, at\r\nFredericksburg, at Gettysburg and Appomattox. They cannot rub the Irish\r\nnames off the records of the Civil War because they are too numerous.\r\nThere was scarcely a home in Ireland in any county or parish which had\r\nnot its representative under that flag when it was embattled and\r\nendangered on the fields of the South. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAnd I repeat it now; I have said it before and I repeat it now, that\r\nthat horrible, fratricidal, prolonged and bloody conflict did as much\r\nfor the Irish in America as it did for the negro whom it freed. It\r\nvindicated the patriotism and gratitude and loyalty of the Irishman, and\r\nthe valor and chivalry of his race displayed by him under that flag,\r\nfrom the beginning to the close of the war, was second to none. And in\r\nevery sacrifice that has been made to found or perpetuate this nation,\r\nIrish men and Irish women, Irish courage and Irish conscience, a never\r\nchanging faith in God, a high Celtic idealism, which is the salt that\r\ngives savour to the gross materialism of the age, a firm belief in the\r\ndivine and national mysteries, sound morals and gratitude, and devotion\r\nto American ideals, have played a most prominent part in the history of\r\nthis, our beloved country. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: I will be most grateful to Mr. McAdoo, if,\r\nbefore the next annual meeting of this Society, he will have the time\r\nand inclination to pen down the beautiful remarks that are in his brain\r\ntonight regarding the Irish in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nHis magnificent speech gives me a cleavage in my continuity of thought.\r\nThere is a Society in the history of the city known as “St. Andrew’s.”\r\nThis Society has $250,000 in its treasury. The illustrious Scotchmen\r\nhave sought, by money, by force of will and by power, to perpetuate the\r\ntraits and achievements of their race and they have done so.\r\n\r\nNow I would appeal to all of you that when you feel the desire or when\r\nan occasion presents itself, you will aid us in the way the Scotchmen\r\nhave aided their Society, by making a contribution to the American Irish\r\nHistorical Society in order that we, too, may have an opportunity of\r\nexploiting our literary geniuses. This matter, ladies and gentlemen, I\r\nlay before you for your consideration and hope it may receive from you\r\nassimilative thought.\r\n\r\nThe most famous Irish societies in this country, the Hibernian Society\r\nin Boston, the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in Philadelphia and the\r\nFriendly Sons of St. Patrick in this city, were all founded and brought\r\nabout by the intense patriotism and zeal of Irish Protestants. It has\r\nbeen most gratifying for us to hear tonight that force and eloquence\r\nfrom one who came from the Province of Ulster. Now we will hear a\r\nre-echo, probably equally as eloquent, from one who came from a\r\nneighboring county in Ireland and settled within the borders of New York\r\nState. I have much pleasure in presenting to you the Rev. J. Havergal\r\nSheppard, D. D., a member of our Society and the next speaker on the\r\nprogram, whose subject is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE IRISH IN PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rev. J. Havergal Sheppard, D. D.:_ Mr. President-General, Ladies and\r\nGentlemen, Honored Guests and Fellow Members of the American Irish\r\nHistorical Society: I esteem it a very great honor that you have\r\nconferred upon me tonight in asking me to speak at this, your annual\r\ngathering. I must confess that I feel somewhat embarrassed in facing\r\nsuch a body of distinguished Irishmen and their friends. It has not\r\noften been my lot to meet so many “Sons of the Ould Sod” or those whose\r\nSires settled on these shores in the passing years as it is tonight.\r\nNevertheless I am proud to be one of you on this occasion; in fact, I\r\nfeel like a fellow countryman of mine, who was in the company of an\r\nEnglishman and a Scotchman. They were complimenting each other, when the\r\nEnglishman asked the Scotchman if he were not a Scotchman what would he\r\nbe, and he answered, an Englishman. Then the Scotchman, not to be\r\noutdone, asked the Englishman if he was not an Englishman what he would\r\nbe, and, of course, he answered a Scotchman. Then they turned to Pat,\r\nwho had been listening to their expressions of friendship, and they\r\nasked him, “Pat, if you were not an Irishman, what would you be?” And\r\nhe, in turn, in true Celtic fashion, answered, “If I was not an Irishman\r\nI would be ashamed of myself.” So if I was not an Irishman, after this\r\ngathering and greeting and what the Irish have done for this country, I\r\nwould be ashamed of myself.\r\n\r\nAn old philosopher once said, “Let us give the past to oblivion, the\r\npresent to duty, the future to Providence,” and I am sure we agree with\r\nhim in two of his propositions, but we differ with his first. We are\r\nwilling to give the present to duty and trust the future to Providence,\r\nbut never give the past to oblivion; not until, at least, every true\r\nAmerican knows the Irish chapter in American history. And it is such a\r\nbody as this that will hasten that glad day for the Irish race, when men\r\nwill know that we have as much right to these shores as any race that\r\never landed here. That starry flag, with its red for love and its white\r\nfor law and its blue for the hope that our fathers saw in a larger\r\nliberty, has been consecrated with the blood of the liberty-loving sons\r\nof the sod.\r\n\r\nThere has never been a battle for right against wrong but “That rascal,\r\nPat,” has been to the front, not only to fight as a private soldier, but\r\nto often lead the van as a commanding officer. We find him on the bench\r\nand at the bar pleading as an able lawyer; before the altar or in the\r\npulpit, performing the sacred duties of religion. In fact, wherever you\r\ngo or whatever profession or trade you enter you will find “That Rascal,\r\nPat.” They are no newcomers to these shores, for shortly after that\r\nmemorable landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock they made their way\r\nacross the trackless main for this new land.\r\n\r\nIt was not the lure of gold but the love of liberty that brought them.\r\nDown-trodden and oppressed in the land of their birth, whether Roman\r\nCatholic or Non-conformist, by unjust and tyrannical laws passed by a\r\ngovernment that had no sympathy with the suffering Irish, every possible\r\nmeans of culture were denied them, until life in the land they loved\r\nbecame unbearable; so those who were able to muster enough money and\r\ncourage crossed the briny deep, with many sad farewells and\r\nheartbreaking partings.\r\n\r\nIt is true that many of those early settlers were from the north and\r\nhad, undoubtedly, been descendents of men who settled there from\r\nScotland and other parts of Britain and Europe; but they had been\r\nresidents of Ireland for several generations before they emigrated here,\r\nand by the right of birth were “Sons of the Sod.” Many Americans of\r\nlater days, as well as British historians, have given the glory to\r\nScotland for what they did for America, and they always speak of them as\r\nScotch-Irish, and when you ask the reason this is done they will tell\r\nyou it is to distinguish between them and the Roman Catholic Irish, but\r\nsupposing we follow that method in our historic research. We would have\r\nto say that every Episcopalian was an Englishman, that every\r\nPresbyterian was a Scotchman and every Roman Catholic was an Italian.\r\nBut again they answer: These people came originally from Scotland, hence\r\nthey are Scotch-Irish; but taking that for granted, which is not the\r\nwhole truth, as we have many other races in Ireland, most of those early\r\nScotch settlers bear Highland names and were not the Scotch Highlanders,\r\nthe same race by blood, as the original Irish, and the only thing that\r\nmade them Scotch was the fact of birth in Scotland; hence when they\r\narrived back in Ireland they became Irish by the same right that they\r\nwere Scotch, that of birth. In fact, they became more Irish than the\r\nIrish themselves. I think enough has been said to introduce my subject\r\ntonight.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to put on record a few facts in regard to the great\r\npart our fellow countrymen played in the Protestant denominations, in\r\nAmerica. As I have already stated, most of the early Irish settlers on\r\nthese shores came from Ulster and were of the Presbyterian faith. Cotton\r\nMather says that previous to 1640 four thousand Presbyterians had\r\narrived in New England, and there is no doubt that many of these came\r\nfrom Ireland. As early as 1662 a group of Irish and Scotch Presbyterians\r\nworshipped in Jamaica, Long Island, and it is claimed that this was the\r\nfirst church of that denomination on this continent.\r\n\r\nBetween 1670–1680 a body of Presbyterians settled on the eastern bank of\r\nthe Elizabeth River in Virginia, who had with them their pastor from\r\nIreland, who continued to labor among them until his death in 1683.\r\nLater one hundred families from Ireland settled Londonderry, New\r\nHampshire, bringing their pastor, Rev. James McGregore, who faithfully\r\nand affectionately labored for their good.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1680 several families of Irish Presbyterians settled in the\r\nlower counties of Maryland and erected several houses of worship, as a\r\nletter from one of them, Colonel William Stevens, was presented in 1680\r\nto the Laggan Presbytery in Ireland, requesting that a minister by sent\r\nto labor in Maryland, and in 1683 the Rev. Francis Makemie arrived by\r\nthe way of Barbadoes and founded the church at Snow Hill. For several\r\nyears he labored as an itinerant preacher or missionary, founding\r\nchurches or strengthening those already started.\r\n\r\n“This pioneer of the church,” says a Presbyterian authority, “was born\r\nin County Donegal, Ireland, and was so earnest, fearless and\r\nindefatigable that he persevered so well in obtaining fellow laborers,\r\nthough he must cross the ocean for them, and in 1704 brought out two\r\nyoung men, one being John Hampton, a fellow countryman. He was\r\ninstrumental in organizing the first classical assembly of the\r\nPresbyterian church in America, 1706.”\r\n\r\nUnder the name of the “Presbytery of Philadelphia,” with the Presbytery\r\nof Dublin as a model, Makemie being elected moderator and thus logically\r\nbecoming the founder of organized Presbyterianism in America.\r\n\r\nIn 1716 there arrived in New York the Rev. William Tennent with his\r\nthree sons, Gilbert, William, Jr., and John, from the County Armagh.\r\nAfter a period of labor in New York State he was called to the pastorate\r\nof the Presbyterian church at Neshiminy, Penn., where he established\r\n“The Log College” in 1726, himself an eminent scholar. He trained a\r\nnumber of godly and useful young men for the ministry, among who were\r\nSamuel Blair and his own three sons. This college was the foundation of\r\nwhich the present Princeton University was built and all those whom I\r\nhave mentioned, as well as others who graduated, became leaders in the\r\ndenomination. It would be superfluous for me to weary you with an\r\naccount of all the great Presbyterian ministers who came to our shores\r\nfrom the Emerald Isle. Suffice to say that the names of Makemie, Mackie,\r\nHampton, Tennent, Blair, Drs. Neill, Junkin, Elliott, Murry, Allison,\r\nPotts, Patterson and Hall stand out in letters of gold in the successful\r\nhistory of that church.\r\n\r\n1760. A party of Irish emigrants might be seen at the Custom House Quay\r\nin Limerick, preparing to leave their native land for these congenial\r\nshores. One of the company, a young man with thoughtful look and\r\nresolute bearing, entered the vessel and from the deck preached a\r\nfarewell sermon to those friends who were to be left behind. This was no\r\nother than Philip Embury, who was destined to play a prominent part in\r\nthe Methodist denomination in America. It was in 1766 that he first\r\nconducted services in New York in his own house to five people. As the\r\ncongregation increased he removed to a rigging loft, then building with\r\nhis own hands the first Methodist church in the new world, which was\r\ncalled “Wesley Chapel” after the founder of the denomination in the old\r\nland. It was situated on John street, and on Oct. 30th, 1768, Embury\r\npreached the sermon of dedication.\r\n\r\nSometime in 1770, after Rev. Robert Williams, another fellow countryman\r\narrived in New York, he removed to Camden Valley with several Irish\r\nfamilies, then a vast wilderness, and organized the Methodist society at\r\nAshgrove, which was named after another Irishman, Thomas Ashton, and\r\nthere he labored until his death in 1773. At the age of 45 years his\r\nremains, after several removals and not even a stone to mark the spot\r\nwhere slept the silent dust, now rests under a marble shaft erected by\r\nthe National Local Preachers’ Association of the Methodist Episcopal\r\nchurch in the village cemetery at Cambridge, N. Y., on which the\r\nfollowing inscription appears: “Philip Embury, the earliest American\r\nminister of the Methodist Episcopal church, here finds his last resting\r\nplace.” Born in Ireland, an emigrant to New York, Embury was the first\r\nto gather a little class in that city to set in motion a train of\r\ninfluences which resulted in the founding of the John street church, the\r\ncradle of American Methodism, the introduction of a system which has\r\nbeautified the earth with salvation and increased the joys of heaven.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that this inscription was penned by a famous fellow\r\ncountryman of Embury, the Rev. Dr. John Newell Maffitt, the\r\nsilver-tongued orator of southern Methodism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HONORABLE CHARLES ALEXANDER,\r\n\r\n  Of Providence.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for Rhode Island.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with Embury’s ministry in New York another Irishman, Rev.\r\nRobert Strawbridge, who was born at Drumsnagh, County Leitrim, and who,\r\nlike Embury, had been a preacher in Ireland, settled at Sams Creek,\r\nFrederick County, Maryland, where he organized several Methodist\r\nsocieties. He had all the characteristic traits of his fellow\r\ncountryman. He was generous, energetic, versatile and somewhat\r\nintractable to authority. During his life he was poor and his family\r\nwere often straitened for food. His members appreciated his genuine zeal\r\nand self-sacrifice, so they took care of his little farm gratuitously in\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\nStrawbridge founded Methodism in Baltimore and Hartford counties, where\r\nhe raised up several preachers, among who were numbered Owen,\r\nStephenson, Perigau, Webster, Watters, Gatch, Haggerty, Durbin and\r\nGarrettson. We discover him penetrating into Pennsylvania and then\r\narousing the population of the eastern shore of Maryland. We trace him\r\nat last to the upper part of Long Green, Baltimore County, where an\r\nopulent and generous public citizen, who admired his character and\r\nsympathized with his poverty, gave him a farm free of rent for life. It\r\nwas during one of his visiting rounds to his spiritual children that he\r\nwas taken sick at the home of Joseph Wheeler and died in the summer of\r\n1781. His grave may be seen today in the Mount Olivet cemetery at\r\nBaltimore, where his greatest success was achieved.\r\n\r\nRobert Williams, with whom we became acquainted on his arrival in New\r\nYork and whose passage was paid from Ireland by his friend, Thomas\r\nAshton, and who took charge of the John street church, New York, after\r\nEmbury, was the pioneer Methodist in Virginia, forming a society in\r\nNorfolk, 1772, which was the germ of the denomination in the state. In\r\n1773 he traveled in various sections of the state, preaching and forming\r\nsocieties, then extending his ministry into North Carolina, where he\r\nalso was the first to plant Methodism. A signal example of his\r\nusefulness was the conversion of Jesse Lee, the heroic founder of\r\nMethodism in New England. He died on the 26th of September, 1775.\r\n\r\n“He was a plain, pointed preacher, indefatigable in his labors,” says a\r\nhistorian of the church, and another says, “His grave is unknown but he\r\nwill live in the history of the Methodist church forever.”\r\n\r\nTime would fail me to tell of all the Sons of Erin who labored in those\r\nearly days for the success of the Methodist cause, but enough has been\r\nsaid to prove, at least, that Irishmen can claim a large place in the\r\nfounding of that denomination on these shores.\r\n\r\nIn the year of 1809 there came to America from Ballymena, County Antrim,\r\nIreland, Thomas Campbell and his son Alexander. They were men of\r\nsterling character, marked ability and decided convictions. For several\r\nyears they were active and successful workers in the Baptist\r\ndenomination and in 1823 Alexander Campbell established the _Christian\r\nBaptist_ and continued as its editor until his break with that\r\ndenomination on doctrinal grounds, and in 1827 he organized the Church\r\nof the Disciple of Christ. So successful became his ministry that a\r\ncollege was demanded for the training of young men for the ministry and\r\nin 1840 he established Bethany College at Bethany, West Virginia, which\r\nhas sent out in the world more than eleven thousand graduates in the\r\npast seventy years, and the denomination which he founded ranks fifth in\r\nthe protestant denominations in America, with a membership of over one\r\nmillion and a half.\r\n\r\nHe died March 4th, 1866, and his remains rest in Bethany, West Virginia.\r\n\r\nI wish I had time to tell you of those of Irish birth who filled\r\nprominent positions in the pulpits of these denominations in later\r\nyears. At one period three of Erin’s sons adorned the pulpits of New\r\nYork City: Rev. Dr. George S. Rainsford, of St. George’s Protestant\r\nEpiscopal Church; Rev. Dr. John Hall, of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian\r\nChurch, and Rev. Dr. Henry M. Gallagher, of the Hanson Place Baptist\r\nChurch of Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nI have presented these facts, not to arouse religious strife, but rather\r\nto give glory to the land of my birth for what her sons have done on\r\nthese shores, in peace as well as in war.\r\n\r\nI am happy to say we are not here representing any sect but a country;\r\nin fact, we are all Irishmen tonight.\r\n\r\nWe have done much for America and well may we be proud of it, but never\r\nforget that America has done much for us.\r\n\r\nWhen it was impossible for us to develop the latent powers born in our\r\nrace in the land we loved we found the opportunities so badly needed\r\nunder the folds of that starry banner, to the joy of every true Irish\r\nheart in this and the old land.\r\n\r\nI hope that we will get to know each other as the years go by and that\r\nthis organization will grow and flourish to the true glory of “Dear Old\r\nIreland.”\r\n\r\n          God bless you, I say, however you pray;\r\n            Your faith will ne’er meet my derision.\r\n          Can’t we kindly talk o’er this matter, asthore,\r\n            And band curse, strife and division.\r\n          And we’ll love one another, my Catholic brother,\r\n            Like loyal-souled Irishmen ever.\r\n          And the heathenish strife that’s consuming our life,\r\n            We’ll bury it forever and ever.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow will soon be\r\nhere, when we can all rest, but an intellectual treat such as you have\r\ntonight is seldom offered this assemblage to participate in. One of the\r\ngreat features of this Society is to have annual meetings, and these are\r\nprefaced by holding Executive Council meetings at different places. Last\r\nsummer the Executive Council met in the city of Providence, and while\r\nthere one of our number entertained us with that pure Celtic\r\nhospitality. This gentleman is one of the few who has participated in\r\nevery event since his advent into the Society, and it is he, Alexander,\r\nwho entertained the Executive Council in his princely style at\r\nMacedonia. I now present to you, Ladies and Gentlemen, Colonel Charles\r\nAlexander of Providence, Vice-President of the Society for the State of\r\nRhode Island.\r\n\r\nHON. CHARLES ALEXANDER: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is\r\nindeed a privilege and an honor for me to meet you tonight for the first\r\ntime as a new member.\r\n\r\nI met one of the gentlemen of this association a few days ago, and\r\ncalling him by name I said, “Do you know that I have been railroaded to\r\nthe speakers table January 8th?” He said, “That is good,” but I said,\r\n“No, that is bad, for I don’t know what to say.”\r\n\r\nIt reminded me very much of the story of two men who met. One said to\r\nthe other, “I have been married since I met you last.” “That is good.”\r\n“Not so good; my wife has a temper.” “That’s bad.” “Not so bad; she’s\r\ngot some money.” “That’s good.” “Not so good; I put the money into sheep\r\nand they all died.” “That’s bad.” “Not so bad; I got the wool.” “That’s\r\ngood.” “Not so good; I put the proceeds of the wool into a tavern, and\r\nthe tavern burned to the ground.” “That’s bad.” “Not so bad; my wife\r\nburned with it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Toastmaster, I am from Rhode Island, and you know what that means,\r\nLadies and Gentlemen. It means that the hand of good cheer is always\r\nextended to anyone visiting our shores. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nI will take but a very few moments of your time.\r\n\r\nThe first tablet to be placed in the State House of Rhode Island in\r\nhonor of an eminent Rhode Islander is that of John Sullivan. It occupies\r\na conspicuous niche near the main entrance, and was placed there by this\r\nSociety. Our State House has ample provision for many more such\r\nmemorials, but this is the only one which has been erected at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThe American Irish who are making history today will be memorialized by\r\nthe descendants of some of the present gathering because of their\r\nachievements, many of whom, I trust, are at this hour here assembled.\r\nThis Society has reason to be proud of the exploits of those whose\r\nworthy deeds it celebrates on every such occasion, and the whole country\r\nshould share with it such pride. In all the wars in the country’s\r\nhistory, they have occupied a position to be proud of, throughout the\r\npeaceful periods, in the halls of legislation and in public life; but\r\nthe honors to be celebrated are not as yet all achieved.\r\n\r\nAmericans of Irish descent are making new names every day, contributing\r\nnew achievements to the record of the country’s service, which future\r\nmeetings of this organization in years to come will surely celebrate.\r\nThe achievements of the past will be a stimulation in the future to\r\nevery member to become worthy of the tribute of this Society; and from\r\nthis fact will be no small incentive to exalted service. So I say—from\r\nthe present generation—right from around this board, history will select\r\nfor remembrance and fame more honorable names to add to the roll, which\r\nit will be the privilege and the duty of this Society to preserve.\r\n\r\nLadies and Gentlemen, you are a friend to man, and this association\r\nmeans something. You are a friend to man, and may I be permitted to\r\nrecite just two or three verses in that line? They emanate from the pen\r\nof a gentleman who has the ability to put splendid thoughts into words.\r\n\r\n      There are hermit souls that live withdrawn\r\n        In the place of their self-content;\r\n      There are souls, like stars, that dwell apart,\r\n        In a fellowless firmament;\r\n      There are pioneer souls that blaze their paths\r\n        Where the highways never ran;\r\n      But let me live by the side of the road\r\n        And be a friend to man.\r\n\r\n      Let me live in a house by the side of the road,\r\n        Where the race of men go by—\r\n      The men who are good and the men who are bad,\r\n        As good and as bad as I.\r\n      I would not sit in the scorner’s seat,\r\n        Or hurl the cynic’s ban—\r\n      Let me live in a house by the side of the road\r\n        And be a friend to man.\r\n\r\n      I see from my house by the side of the road,\r\n        By the side of the highway of life,\r\n      The men who press on with the ardor of hope,\r\n        And the men who are faint with the strife.\r\n      But I turn not away from their smiles or their tears—\r\n        Both parts of an infinite plan;—\r\n      Let me live in my house by the side of the road\r\n        And be a friend to man.\r\n\r\n      I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead\r\n        And mountains of wearisome height;\r\n      That the road passes on through the long afternoon\r\n        And stretches away to the night.\r\n      But still I rejoice when the travellers rejoice,\r\n        And weep with the strangers that moan,\r\n      Nor live in my house by the side of the road,\r\n        Like a man who dwells alone.\r\n\r\n      Let me live in a house by the side of the road,\r\n        Where the race of men go by—\r\n      They are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong,\r\n        Wise, foolish—so am I.\r\n      Then why should I sit in the scorner’s seat,\r\n        Or hurl the cynic’s ban?—\r\n      Let me live in my house by the side of the road\r\n        And be a friend to man.\r\n\r\nI thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: We have been entertained by many\r\ndistinguished orators in the past and even on this great occasion in our\r\nSociety’s History—the classic prose is every-day work but poetry seems\r\nalmost a gift of inspiration. One of our number has again drawn his pen,\r\ncalled upon the Muse, and how readily she has answered him you soon\r\nshall know. I will only mention our Poet’s name, Mr. John Jerome Rooney,\r\nwho will read a poem which he has composed and dedicated to our Society.\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN JEROME ROONEY: Mr. President, “Ballad of Saucy Jack Barry.” The\r\nincident which is the subject of these lines is one of the picturesque\r\nincidents in the life of John Barry, the father of the American Navy.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred in the winter of 1778, February 26, and the scene\r\nwas the Delaware River. The British were occupying Philadelphia at the\r\ntime, and a British fleet was anchored in the Delaware, opposite the\r\ncity of Philadelphia. John Barry, with his ship, “Effingham,” and two or\r\nthree smaller boats, had been compelled to take refuge, in the presence\r\nof a superior fleet, in the upper waters of the Delaware at Burlington;\r\nbut it was not the intention of John Barry to sit still while there was\r\na possibility of adventure of any kind, and he petitioned Congress,\r\nafter he had been there only three or four weeks, to be allowed to make\r\nan attack upon a British war vessel that was anchored in the lower\r\nDelaware, by name the “Alert,” that was convoying two transports filled\r\nwith food and forage for the sustenance of the British in Philadelphia.\r\nThe request was granted, and the story that I have tried to tell is the\r\nstory of how John Barry went down the river; the result I will leave to\r\nthe fortunes of the rhyme.\r\n\r\n                BALLAD OF SAUCY JACK BARRY.\r\n\r\n                (Episode of February 26, 1778.)\r\n\r\n    They have taken the old rebel city of Penn;\r\n    Lord Howe, he has filled it with red-coated men.\r\n    “What terror,” said he, “has the winter for me,\r\n    Since I hold the town and my ships hold the sea?”\r\n\r\n    But it never is safe, in making a boast,\r\n    To reckon too easy, not counting your host;\r\n    Or is it quite prudent to count on your boat\r\n    When saucy Jack Barry is up and afloat?\r\n\r\n    There were banquets for Captains and plenty for all;\r\n    The horses had forage, too much for the stall;\r\n    Double rations were served—in truth ’twas a feast,\r\n    And prospects were cheery for man and for beast.\r\n\r\n    But bins have a bottom and larders grow thin\r\n    When plenty comes out and nothing goes in;\r\n    But his Lordship smiled blandly such trifles away—\r\n    “The ‘Alert’ and two transports are down in the Bay!”\r\n\r\n    But it never is safe, in making a boast,\r\n    To reckon too easy, not counting your host;\r\n    Or is it quite prudent to count on your boat\r\n    When saucy Jack Barry is up and afloat?\r\n\r\n    The Delaware waters come down with a sweep\r\n    Past Burlington town, snow-clad and asleep,\r\n    And there lay our “Effingham,” silent and stark,\r\n    A ghost of the sea, looming up thro’ the dark.\r\n\r\n    Then, sudden, four boats sweep out from her side,\r\n    With oars swift and muffled swing down in the tide;\r\n    The moon has gone black, the wind whistles high,\r\n    And the scud of the thunder-storm darkens the sky.\r\n\r\n    Down the river they went, like the flight of a bird;\r\n    The twenty and seven said never a word—\r\n    They are after the fox of the ocean again,\r\n    And they’ll make not a stir as they enter his den.\r\n\r\n    It was three o’ the clock when, faintly ahead,\r\n    The lights of the city flashed yellow and red—\r\n    Then, sudden, a gleam, a cannon’s dull roar,\r\n    A challenge and halt from the river and shore.\r\n\r\n    But, surely, no need then to speak to them twice—\r\n    Four nautical heels were shown in a trice;\r\n    Down thro’ the night, like a hound, they’re away\r\n    To the lair of their quarry in Delaware Bay.\r\n\r\n    The sun had come up when they rounded Port Penn.\r\n    And O what a sight there for gods and for men!\r\n    A schooner (ten guns pointed out from her side,\r\n    With the flag of the Briton) swung free in the tide.\r\n\r\n    With a leap like a tiger the boats swung around,\r\n    Then straight for the Briton, with bound upon bound.\r\n    “Grapple tight!” cried the Captain, and guiding his band,\r\n    Up the side went Jack Barry, with cutlass in hand!\r\n\r\n    He is over the rails in the flash of an eye,—\r\n    “Strike, strike yonder flag or, by heaven, you die!”\r\n    But never a hand or a foot there did turn;\r\n    They were frozen with terror from stem unto stern.\r\n\r\n    With a yell the bold Britons their weapons let go,\r\n    Then, like mice in a pantry, they scurried below.\r\n    “Boys, batter the hatches,” called Jack to his men;\r\n    “We have got the red fox, at last, in his den.”\r\n\r\n    The “Kitty” and “Mermaid” awoke, with a start,\r\n    With the guns of their gallant trained straight at their heart.\r\n    Their “Alert” was caught napping (drowsy lovers, beware!)\r\n    And saucy Jack Barry had captured the fair.\r\n\r\n    “Ho, run her in shore to yonder good pier;\r\n    We’ll see how the foxes are burrowing here.\r\n    Now loosen the hatches! Come foe or come friend!\r\n    You’ll find Yankee sailors will take either end!”\r\n\r\n    Then up came a Major; forsooth, he was glum;\r\n    Two Captains, lieutenants, a man with a drum;\r\n    Ten soldiers paced out, then a hundred marines,\r\n    Like a troop in a play, strode out from the scenes!\r\n\r\n    O the twenty and seven who came down thro’ the night\r\n    Were as proud as the Cæsars to see such a sight;\r\n    Three cheers, and three more boomed up, like the seas,\r\n    As the flag of the Stars broke out on the breeze!\r\n\r\n    O it is never safe, in making a boast,\r\n    To reckon too easy, not counting your host;\r\n    Nor is it quite prudent to count on your boat\r\n    When saucy Jack Barry is up and afloat!\r\n                                        JOHN JEROME ROONEY.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: Owing to the absence of Hon. W. A.\r\nPrendergast, who has been kept away by illness, we will proceed to the\r\nnext speaker. I will ask you all to remain seated for a little while\r\nlonger. I introduce to you one of the most distinguished Irishmen in our\r\ngreat city,—the man who, on every occasion where the cause of Ireland\r\ncould be voiced, has stood in the foremost ranks; and, although he has\r\npetitioned me tonight to let him off, it would be like the play of\r\n“Hamlet” without Hamlet. I will ask Hon. John W. Goff, one of the\r\nJustices of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, to say a few\r\nwords to this assemblage. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. PATRICK F. McGOWAN.\r\n\r\n  President of the Board of Aldermen and Acting Mayor\r\n  of New York. 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1909.\r\n\r\n  Life Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHON. JOHN W. GOFF: The hour is late. I beg of you to excuse me tonight\r\nand grant the privilege of allowing me to speak at some other time, when\r\nI shall have the advantage of being better prepared. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: We have at our table a dark horse in the\r\nLists of Orators, and one who has often entertained, edified and\r\neducated his auditors, not only by easy rhetoric, show of measured\r\neloquence, but also by the erudition of his thoughtful words. I take the\r\nprivilege of introducing to you Mr. Edward M. Tierney.\r\n\r\nMR. EDWARD M. TIERNEY: Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen, it would\r\nbe most ungenerous for me to make a distinction of a different character\r\nfrom that already presented by the honorable gentleman who has just sat\r\ndown and attempt, at this late hour, to give you the speech that I had\r\nprepared for this evening.\r\n\r\nYou have been regaled with oratory sublime; all that is great and\r\nglorious to the Irishman has been brought down deep into the recesses of\r\nhis heart tonight by the preceding speakers. I have a speech that I may\r\ntwist and distort, perhaps, to suit the hour without making it too\r\nlengthy, and, if you will bear with me for a few moments, I may interest\r\nyou before I sit down.\r\n\r\nWhen your President-General invited me to make this speech he was full\r\nof prescience, if I may call it so, for he limited me to ten minutes.\r\nWhy he placed this restriction on me some two weeks ago I was then at a\r\nloss to understand; but it is very plain to me tonight, Ladies and\r\nGentlemen, the object being to give the President-General an unbridled\r\nopportunity to furnish all the hot air for this occasion himself. That’s\r\nall right, for he belongs to a profession that understands the\r\nsymptomatic temperament of an audience, and can tell just when to\r\nadminister the anæsthetic. It’s about time to do it now, Doctor.\r\n\r\nI was warned not to make my speech too serious, nor yet permit it to\r\nimpinge too closely on the border line of levity, and so I am cautioned\r\nin advance to mend my speech lest it mar my fortune.\r\n\r\nThis is a difficult feat to perform for one whose blood is tingling with\r\nthe pent-up enthusiasm of an American-Irishman, who feels a native pride\r\nin the long line of conquests of his people in every clime the sun\r\nshines on, and who tonight rejoices in the triumphs of this Society,\r\nwhich is the medium of bringing together, under the broad canopy of\r\nfraternity, the men and the women here assembled. Isn’t this a beautiful\r\nspectacle to behold? Here we are, all animated by the same desire to\r\nperpetuate in a fitting manner the names and deeds of the men with Irish\r\nblood in their veins, who gave to the world the highest and noblest\r\nattributes of their minds and hearts for the betterment of mankind and\r\nfor the elevation of the race.\r\n\r\nAn American-Irishman, like myself, should be very grateful to be alive,\r\nwhich is saying a great deal in some localities, since the tramp of the\r\nancient hordes is heard in the land, and the scions of shattered\r\ndynasties are now holding the sceptre of power through the influence of\r\ndominant wealth.\r\n\r\nI believe more and more in the theory that, to get the best out of an\r\nindividual or a nation, you must first subject them to some gross\r\ninjustice, which stings the pride and awakens the indignation, until\r\nthey arm themselves with stirring forces to right the wrong.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that a great man is sometimes willing to humble himself\r\nby indifferently sitting on the cushion of advantage and going to sleep.\r\nAnd it is only when he is driven, annoyed and defeated that he is put to\r\nhis wits’ end and compelled to draw on his manhood to learn the things\r\nmost essential to his preservation and his honor.\r\n\r\nIt was through such exigencies as these that the Irishmen in America\r\nwere pushed to find moderation and success in the highway of honest\r\nendeavor, which led on and on into the field of competitive personal\r\nrivalry, where at last the genius of the race was triumphant over every\r\nphase of intimidation and coercion.\r\n\r\nThe success of Irishmen in this home of the exile may be due, in large\r\nmeasure, to the application of the lesson that is taught by Balzac:\r\n\r\n“To make your way in the world, you must plough through humanity like a\r\ncannon ball, or glide through it like a pestilence.”\r\n\r\nThis axiom bears particular significance when applied to the pioneers of\r\nour race, who were confronted with obstacles and difficulties that\r\nloomed up like pyramids in the desert of despair, only to retard their\r\nprogress in the onward march toward the golden temple of hope, around\r\nwhose throne were clustered the cherished symbols of religious freedom\r\nand individual liberty, that shone forth, in resplendent array, to light\r\nthe wanderer’s footsteps and guide him along the green and thriving path\r\nof industrial and commercial supremacy that is vouchsafed to every man\r\nof honor and thrift, who comes to this free country to escape the\r\nthralldom and tyranny of a foreign yoke.\r\n\r\nHere he can find the glorious sunburst of consolation in the cloudless\r\nsky of equality that sheds its rays amid the conflicting emotions of\r\nhope and fear, and blood and carnage, and doubt and bigotry, and\r\nchivalry and patriotism—all alike being imbued with the warmth and glow\r\nof its comforting and protecting influence, that ensures to every loyal\r\nson an equal privilege to that liberty and pursuit of happiness which is\r\nthe birthright of every American citizen.\r\n\r\n              Forever float that standard sheet!\r\n                Where breathes the foe but falls before us\r\n              With freedom’s soil beneath our feet,\r\n                With freedom’s banner streaming o’er us!\r\n              Breathes there a man with soul so dead\r\n              Who never to himself hath said,\r\n                “This is my own, my native land.”\r\n\r\nIf there be such a man in all the world, I pity him. One thing is\r\ncertain, he is not an Irishman, for if he were the blood would congeal\r\nin his veins and he would be branded as a wanderer upon the face of the\r\nearth, with no place to lay his hypocritical head.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about the Irishman in America, but nothing has been\r\nsaid so far about the American in Ireland. It might be well for me to\r\ntouch on the subject somewhat and tell you a little of my experience in\r\nIreland, and by way of preface it seems to me that every Irish-American\r\nmust hold down deep in his heart a lurking desire to visit the Green\r\nIsle, the land of his fathers, just as I did before I went over there\r\nfive years ago and saw for myself the things that have made Irishmen\r\ngreat in America.\r\n\r\nHow vividly the memories of that visit rise up before me to bring added\r\njoys to the realities of life! That you may better understand my first\r\nimpressions of Ireland, I will tell you that I was after finishing an\r\nextended tour of the Orient, which included the Holy Land and a great\r\npart of Continental Europe, when I entered the portals of the historic\r\ncity of Dublin. My heart leaped with joy as I felt the friendly breeze\r\nof welcome soothe my throbbing brain, and I longed at that moment to\r\nshare the sublime satisfaction that came o’er me with some kindred\r\nspirit who had years ago trod the same earth and looked with beseeching\r\nglance, as perhaps millions more did before him, out beyond the great\r\nwaters, where liberty and personal freedom were to be found.\r\n\r\nBut I was alone and could not impart to another the impulses that rose\r\nup within me and bade me view the matchless beauty of that fair city\r\nwherein is consecrated all the glories of Erin’s past, and where today,\r\non the living altar of heroic patriotism, is to be seen the surpliced\r\nmessenger of Home Rule, ready with trumpet in hand to proclaim to all\r\nthe world that Emmet’s epitaph shall soon be written.\r\n\r\nTo stand upon the sod made sacred by the ties of kinship and hallowed by\r\nmemories that made the new scenes seem as familiar as though one were\r\nborn and reared among them was the sensation I experienced when I first\r\nset my foot upon the soil where my father and mother first saw the light\r\nof day. There was something indefinably realistic about my presence in\r\nthe small town of the Six Mile Bridge in County Clare.\r\n\r\nThe very atmosphere seemed to be full of the incense of welcome that\r\nmade me feel at home, and when I entered the old church, which had so\r\noften been described to me in earlier days by my parents, there came\r\nover me an awesome reverence for every stick and stone in it. I could\r\npicture in my mind’s eye the very spot where they knelt to pledge their\r\nplight and to offer up prayers for their safe voyage to America, whither\r\nthey were compelled to come to seek that means of subsistence which\r\ntheir own impoverished village could not provide. He who has not felt\r\nthe thrill of such heart-throbs has missed the holiest emotions of\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nTo visit Ireland and not go through the Gap of Dunloe and take a nip of\r\npoteen and goat’s milk at Kate Kearney’s cottage on the way to the Lakes\r\nof Killarney, and then to be safely rowed through them by four sturdy\r\noarsmen, with a stop at Dinas Island (for nautical purposes only), would\r\nbe a loss even as great as not to visit Blarney Castle and kiss the\r\nBlarney Stone.\r\n\r\nEver since that eventful day when I hung over the parapet and essayed to\r\ntake osculatory liberties with that hammer face member of the stone\r\nfamily, there seems to be an elasticity to my tongue and oleaginous\r\nflavor to my words that are possessed only by the lovers of art and\r\nnature, who believe in the Stone Age and in Memnon’s harp that plays a\r\nmelody, far away from the habitat of man, to give greeting each morn to\r\nthe rising sun.\r\n\r\nA scene of lasting remembrance to me was the one I witnessed in\r\nQueenstown the night before our good ship, “Majestic,” sailed for this\r\nport. On every hilltop and from every vantage point one could discern,\r\nlike a silhouette athwart the blackened night, bonfires brightly\r\nburning, each one being the harbinger of friendly greeting to the other\r\nand all betokening the emblems of Ireland’s motto, “Hospitality, virtue\r\nand courage.”\r\n\r\nThat scene symbolized in no uncertain meaning the genuine love and\r\nsincerity of a loyal people, who made those beacon lights shine forth in\r\nluminous colors to give encouragement to the faithful hearts of the\r\nblushing maids and the fearless lads, who were about to leave the land\r\nof their birth and sever forever the ties of friendship by coming to\r\nAmerica to find here a haven of safety from the thralldom and oppression\r\nof their home land.\r\n\r\nI will conclude by quoting a few lines from Emerson:\r\n\r\n                Teach me your mood, O patient stars;\r\n                  Who climb each night the ancient sky,\r\n                Leaving no space, no shade, no scars,\r\n                  No trace of age, no fear to die.\r\n\r\nIf Emerson had dedicated this sentiment to Ireland and her patriotic\r\nsons, he could not more fittingly have described her relations to the\r\nimplacable foe whose mood, after centuries of oppression and warfare,\r\nhas not been able to dim the lustre of that patient Star of Hope which\r\nwill shine on continuously to illumine space, without shading, but with\r\nthe scars of memory to make more radiant the valor and virtue of her\r\npeople who carry on their brow no trace of age, and in their hearts no\r\nfear to die in the cause of human freedom.\r\n\r\nI thank you.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT-GENERAL QUINLAN: This concludes the Twelfth Annual Banquet of\r\nthe American-Irish Historical Society. I thank you all in the name of\r\nthe administration for your presence and your hearty coöperation in this\r\nfeast of reason and flow of soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Historical Papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE IRISH SHARE IN THE HUDSON-FULTON CELEBRATION.\r\n\r\n  BY JOSEPH I. C. CLARKE, ESQ., VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY FOR NEW\r\n                                 YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nNew York, greatest of American cities and second of all cities of the\r\nworld in point of population and perhaps of wealth, paused for a week in\r\nSeptember, 1909, nominally to honor two great memories, really to\r\ncelebrate itself.\r\n\r\nIt may be that Henry Hudson, when he sailed the Half-Moon up the great\r\nNorth River to the head of navigation and then returned to the ocean in\r\n1609, never set foot on the Island of Manhattan; but the settlement by\r\nthe Dutch that followed was certainly the result of his voyage of\r\ndiscovery. His was, therefore, a good epoch-making name to honor. More\r\ndirectly was it meet to honor the name of Robert Fulton, whose conquest\r\nof the waters with the power of steam in 1807 was made from New York\r\nshipyards, and upon the mighty stream that Hudson was the first white\r\nman to navigate. That in the person of Fulton, Ireland had a share in\r\nthe memories of these celebrated men—for he was the son of Irish\r\nimmigrants—appealed powerfully, as it should, to the race pride of the\r\nIrish-born and Irish-descended of the City of New York. It insured their\r\nhearty coöperation in the plans for the Hudson-Fulton celebration. But\r\nto many the event suggested the question, what share the Irish race has\r\nhad in the upbuilding of New York, and what stake it holds in its life\r\nand its prosperity today. Others better fitted must work out the details\r\nof the answer, of which here is presented something of a summary. At any\r\nrate, it covers matters well worthy of the research which naturally\r\ndrifts to a society like ours. Before attempting to record the Irish\r\nshare in New York’s Hudson-Fulton celebration, let us examine briefly\r\nIreland’s share in New York itself.\r\n\r\nHere came the bulk of the great successive waves of emigration from\r\nIreland. How large the total of the children of Ireland, who cast their\r\nlot with this Republic, history does not tell us with any accuracy. They\r\nwere here from the very beginning of the white man’s settlement on\r\nManhattan Island. Before 1820, no governmental roster of immigrants was\r\nkept, but in the eighty years from 1821 to 1900, the United States\r\ncensus bureau counts up a total of 3,871,253 Irish immigrants, nearly\r\n3,000,000 coming hither between 1851 and 1900. That this enormous inflow\r\ncame from a country that at its highest tide-mark of population never\r\nnumbered more than 8,000,000 souls is a fact at once astounding and\r\nappalling. Ireland literally cuts itself in two to supply the emigration\r\nto America. Besides this outflow to America, another stream ran to\r\nEngland, Australia and New Zealand, but to each in much smaller volume\r\nthan crossed the Atlantic. At its highest flow it brought over nearly a\r\nmillion Irish souls in ten years, namely, between 1851 and 1860. Since\r\nthen it has fallen away, but what this immigration has meant in the\r\nupbuilding of the country at large may be imagined from the deduction\r\nmade by the United State census of 1900. It is therein stated that\r\n“Ireland contributed more than two-fifths of the immigration between\r\n1821 and 1850; more than one-third from 1851 to 1860; nearly one-fifth\r\nfrom 1861 to 1870.” In the following decade the stream held about the\r\nsame level. Between 1881 and 1890 it rose again by nearly fifty per\r\ncent. Thenceforward the drain upon Ireland was to lessen, and with a\r\ntotal of 390,179 between 1891 and 1900 it represented barely more than\r\none-tenth of the total immigration for the ten years. Since 1900 it has\r\nsteadily declined, mainly for the reason that Ireland is nearly drained\r\nof its emigration material, but also in some degree that better\r\nconditions are obtaining there. A backward glance shows that of the\r\nnearly twenty millions of immigrants from all lands up to 1900 one in\r\nevery five came from Ireland.\r\n\r\nFor the eighty years back of 1820 the proportion of Irish immigrants was\r\neven larger—probably one in four. And it was not, as many of the\r\ndescendants of the early Irish immigration have imagined, entirely of\r\nthe better off and entirely from the north of Ireland. Doubtless the\r\nPresbyterians of the northern Irish counties predominated, and counted\r\nin their ranks men of the learned professions as well as artificers and\r\nmerchants, but of the tens of thousands of pure Celts from the central,\r\nsouthern and western counties deported to the West Indies in the\r\nseventeenth century many thousands found their way to the settlements of\r\nwhat are now the southern states of the Union. Original researches among\r\ncolonial records by a member of our society show that during the century\r\nand a half before the Revolution several thousand immigrants of Celtic\r\nstock came direct to the colonies from Ireland.\r\n\r\nOf the Irish emigration before the Revolution and up to 1820, the\r\npresence in New York of numbers of Irish high in standing as well as\r\nstalwart in activity is easily proven. One of the leading merchants in\r\n1655 bore the historic name of Hugh O’Neale. New York City received its\r\nfirst charter from the hands of Sir Thomas Dougan, an Irishman, in 1684.\r\nMany old Irish names appear in the census of the City of New York for\r\n1703. New York’s first mayor after the Revolution, James Duane, was the\r\nson of a Galway man. The first governor of the State of New York, and\r\nafterwards vice-president of the United States, George Clinton, was also\r\nan Irishman’s son. His kinsman, DeWitt Clinton, was a mayor of New York,\r\nUnited States senator and governor of the State, and is known to history\r\nas “the father of the Erie Canal.” Christopher Colles, from County Cork,\r\nIreland, was the originator of our system of rail and waterways. His\r\ngrave is in St. Paul’s. Thomas Addis Emmet, a resident of New York, was\r\nattorney general of the State. Daniel O’Brien established the first\r\nferry to Perth Amboy. Dominick Lynch first introduced Italian opera to\r\nour city. He was also the founder of the Town of Rome, N. Y.\r\n\r\nResounding names of men of Irish blood are, indeed, plentiful, but they\r\nare only in this paper to be taken as symptomatic of the Irish-born and\r\ndescended population, gradually growing in the city to a commanding\r\ninfluence. Peter McCartee was an alderman in 1815, and John McManus\r\nmarshal of police in the same year. Irish names grew to prominence not\r\nonly in the police and fire departments, but in the ranks of the\r\nteachers in the public schools. Of this eminence in three branches of\r\nthe public service perhaps the greatest stress should be laid on the\r\nlast. As school teachers, women and men, the Irish and Irish-descended\r\nhave held the front place, in brains as well as numbers, for a hundred\r\nyears in New York, holding it still, from William H. Maxwell, the great\r\nsuperintendent of the past twenty years, down to the latest teachers in\r\nthe primary grades.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1833 it was computed that there were 44,000 of Irish birth\r\nor descent in New York City, which at that time meant Manhattan Island\r\nonly. But the days were at hand when the combination of famine with\r\nbrutal oppression was about to result in the casting forth from Ireland\r\nliterally of millions of our people. That America should receive the\r\ngreatest share was inevitable, and that New York should receive, if only\r\nfor a temporary stay, the majority of these was natural. From 1846 to\r\n1860 fully a million and a half of the famine-driven children of Ireland\r\nwere poured upon the shores of America. And they came, for the very\r\nlargest part, poorly clad, unlettered, uncouth, often weakened sorely in\r\nbody by prolonged semi-starvation. Thousands—men, women and\r\nchildren—died of ship fever, of sea-sickness in debilitated frames, of\r\ninability to digest the wretched food supplied them on the long passage\r\nin the overcrowded sailing ships of the day. How many died of heartbreak\r\nalone, God only knows. But the survivors! In their bodies, at least,\r\nthey soon vindicated the indestructibility of the Celt. Unskilled,\r\nexcept in a very small fraction, they took up the hardest kind of labor.\r\nThey built the railroads, the canals; they “carried cities upon their\r\nbacks.” It was a terrible story, working slowly to a happier\r\nconsummation. They brought an instinctive loyalty to American\r\ninstitutions. Bitter were the prejudices they had to face, but they\r\nmanaged to outlive them all.\r\n\r\nNaturally, in such case, they clung together. New York already had given\r\nthe Irish exiles a home. Here their real qualities had had time to\r\nassert themselves, and here, accordingly, the newcomers of the later\r\nforties and early fifties settled freely. In politics they became\r\nDemocrats, simply because Democracy never joined in their proscription\r\nas emigrants unfit to be Americans, while other parties did in lesser or\r\ngreater degree. In religion they remained Catholic or Protestant as they\r\ncame, and that meant largely Catholic.\r\n\r\nThis large substratum of newcomers from Ireland found here, as has been\r\nintimated, a large and fairly prospering Irish-born and Irish-descended\r\npopulation—furnishing men of eminence to all the higher callings—judges,\r\nlawyers, clergymen, physicians, merchants and manufacturers. With an\r\nassimilation more rapid than with any other race, the famine-exiles took\r\nup the order of American life. Their children filled the public schools\r\nand found Irish teachers there. They attended and supported churches\r\nwhose hierarchy from archbishop to priest was almost wholly Irish. Thus\r\nthe Celtic complexion of the city was enhanced, and it is no doubt true\r\nthat at the outbreak of the Civil War, the population of New York\r\n(Manhattan) was nearer to one-third than one-fourth of Irish blood.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose to pursue here the history of the Irish in New\r\nYork City from the outbreak of the Civil War through the half century to\r\nour day. To the battle for the Union, however, the New York Irish\r\nfurnished magnificent quotas of fighting men, and capable officers,\r\nearning names for bravery and skill, as would be expected of their race.\r\nIndeed, it was the whole-souled devotion of the Irish all over the\r\nnorthern states and their brilliant services in the field and on the sea\r\nthat threw down the last barriers of prejudice against their people in\r\nAmerica. Such a name as Phil Sheridan’s was one to charm with, not to\r\nname another of the galaxy of great Irish captains of the war.\r\n\r\nThe Irish immigrant stream was, however, still flowing. From 1861 to\r\n1900 they numbered over 2,000,000 souls, but this later flood came in\r\nsomewhat better estate than their forerunners—fairly equalling in\r\ncondition the concurrent German immigration and easily surpassing all\r\nothers. It is for the most part, naturally, of these comers since 1860,\r\nthat our Irish-born of today are composed, and through the entire\r\ncountry they can be found in substantial positions. But it is of their\r\nchildren and the children and grandchildren of the earlier immigration\r\nthat the wonder-story of worldly uprise is to be told. New York, of\r\ncourse, has its share, and a large one, in this. If we can pick out from\r\nthe later decades of the nineteenth century such names as James T. Brady\r\nand Charles O’Conor at the bar, A. T. Stewart among the merchants,\r\nEugene Kelly among the bankers, William H. Grace, the great pioneer\r\nmerchant of South America and twice our mayor; Archbishop Hughes,\r\nCardinal McCloskey among the clerics, John W. Mackay among the great\r\ncapitalists, Augustus St. Gaudens among the sculptors, O’Callaghan,\r\nMurphy and O’Reilly among the historians, how many names of eminence in\r\nevery walk of art, science, law, religion, commerce, manufacture can be\r\nfurnished from the Irish-born and Irish-descended of today! There are\r\nthe great builders like John B. McDonald, who constructed the subway;\r\nJames Coleman, who built the great Croton dam; but why enter on a list\r\nas long as that of the ships in Homer? Be it Thomas Fortune Ryan or John\r\nD. Crimmins in the world of finance, the representatives of Irish brain\r\nare there. It is of record that the second president of the New York\r\nChamber of Commerce, which was founded in 1768, was Hugh Wallace, an\r\nIrishman. It is worthy of remark that Alexander E. Orr, also a native of\r\nIreland, was president of the same body, until a year ago, and that his\r\nsuccessor is J. Edward Simmons, also of Irish blood, who in his time has\r\nbeen lawyer, bank president, President of the Stock Exchange, President\r\nof the Board of Education and President of the New York Clearing House.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to the collective work of the Irish of New York one had\r\nbetter turn. From the United States census of 1900 it is deduced that\r\nthe natives of Ireland in Greater New York numbered 285,000, while the\r\nchildren of Irish parents numbered 308,000, and the descendants of Irish\r\nin the third and fourth generations numbered 200,000, or a total of\r\n793,000 of Irish blood in a total for the city of 3,437,000—a proportion\r\nlittle less than one in four. With the increase of the city’s population\r\nsince 1900 it is not quite likely that the Irish stock has kept pace,\r\nand a diminishing ratio in point of numbers may be expected. The inflow\r\nfrom southeastern Europe, from Poland, Russia and Italy has greatly (and\r\nhappily) exceeded the stream from Ireland. Yet here in New York will be\r\nfound, when the census of this year is taken, an Ireland of not far from\r\na million, in its expected total approaching 5,000,000 souls.\r\n\r\nNot all of that million remembers Old Ireland as Motherland, but it must\r\nbe the task of societies like ours to awaken the sleeping memories.\r\n\r\nThere is no way of arriving directly at the proportion of the city’s\r\nwealth which is the possession of the Irish million. It would,\r\ndoubtless, prove a mighty total, for Irish thrift and Irish talent for\r\naccumulation have been proven here to be as existent and constant as the\r\ncarefully nurtured legend to the contrary. If there was some uproarious\r\nspending among the earlier arrivals on their first contact with earned\r\nAmerican gold, and if they rose slowly, at first, from the poor estate\r\nin which they came, yet the families they raised in decency, the\r\nimposing array of churches and schools they paid for the building of,\r\nand still sustain, are first hand proofs that they are sound and normal\r\nin the greater civic virtues. The Catholic churches in Greater New York,\r\nfrom the great cathedral of St. Patrick and the splendid St. Francis\r\nXavier of the Jesuits to the smallest suburban chapel, number 257\r\nedifices, and it is safe to say that ninety-eight per cent. of the funds\r\nfor rearing them and keeping them have come from the Irish immigrants\r\nand their children, not in great gifts, not often in large individual\r\nsubscriptions, but dollar by dollar and dime by dime from the building\r\nof St. Peter’s in Vesey Street a hundred years ago down to the present\r\nday. The Catholic parochial schools—the creation, one may say, of the\r\npast quarter century—most of them imposingly housed, number 154,\r\ninstructing 120,000 pupils and almost all at the cost of Irish Catholic\r\ncontributions. It is not proper here to discuss the church policy, which\r\nputs this charge upon its faithful over and above the share they pay in\r\ncommon with other citizens to the public school fund but it may here be\r\nnoted that the parochial schools are a significant monument to Irish\r\ngenerosity and the deeper devotion which puts the moral and religious\r\nabove the mere utilitarian. The public school pupils number over\r\n600,000, but the seating capacity of the schools has never filled the\r\nwonderfully growing demand. The alternative of half-day classes in the\r\nmost congested neighborhoods has even failed to take in all the children\r\nseeking instruction. The public schools attract a large proportion of\r\nthe Irish-descended children of the great city, and, as has been noted,\r\nthe number of Irish-descended teachers is very high in comparison with\r\nthose from other nationalities. Here, however, side by side with the\r\ngreat educational work of the municipality, is a school system\r\ninstructing one-fifth as many children in the name of religious ideality\r\nand entirely supported by the resident members of the Catholic faith. In\r\naddition to these are thirty-seven colleges and academies of higher\r\nlearning and two religious seminaries educating for the priesthood. The\r\n450 edifices, thus scantily summarized, represent a total valuation,\r\naccording to the best authorities, of not less than $40,000,000, and\r\npossibly, with work in progress, approach the great total of\r\n$50,000,000. This is a very noble portion of Ireland’s monument in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nGreat as these sums may be, they give but a sorry measure of the value\r\nof the churches to the Irish themselves, furnishing as they have done a\r\nmoral anchorage beyond the power of words to describe. Most necessary\r\nwere they to a people taken rudely from their homes and sent naked and\r\nadrift in a new and strange world, where the battle was no longer the\r\nmere struggle for existence but a conflict for power and wealth, in\r\nwhich the sharpest wits, acting through the loosest morals, were often\r\nthe victors. Well may the New York Irish view this array of churches,\r\nschools and colleges with some glow of pride—and gratitude.\r\n\r\nIt is not that the Protestant Irish of New York were wanting in their\r\nshare of church building. They more rapidly merged in the American\r\nbranches of their respective sects, but it is well to remember that an\r\n“Irish Presbyterian Church” existed on Orange Street in New York in\r\n1811, as well as an “Erin Lodge of Freemasons,” and that Irish\r\nProtestant clerics like the late Dr. John Hall have in goodly numbers\r\nfilled the most important pulpits in New York and Brooklyn for over a\r\ncentury and a half. The famous John Street Methodist Church was founded\r\nby Irishmen. It is probable that in the greater city there are 200,000\r\npersons of Protestant faith, who are either native Irish or in whole or\r\nin part of Irish descent.\r\n\r\nIn such an establishment as St. Vincent’s hospital, in the New York\r\nFoundling Asylum, the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, the Catholic\r\nProtectory, the House of the Good Shepherd are other highly valuable\r\nproofs of organizing genius and generous sustaining power on the part of\r\nthe Irish of New York.\r\n\r\nAmong the long-established and wisely administered savings banks of the\r\ncity, none has a prouder record or a firmer base than the Emigrant\r\nIndustrial Savings Bank, which has been distinctly, almost wholly, Irish\r\nin its administration and until lately in its depositors. In the last\r\nfew years it has attracted great numbers of Italians, scared out of\r\ntheir first implicit faith in the many irresponsible “banks” set up by\r\ntheir countrymen. With its deposits over $98,000,000, an army of\r\ndepositors numbering over 122,000, and an unbroken history of successful\r\nmanagement of sixty years (it was incorporated in 1850) the Emigrant\r\nBank is surely a magnificent exhibit of Irish trust and Irish\r\nefficiency. Its president, Thomas Mulry, was, up to the first of the\r\nyear, Commissioner of Charity for New York. In that office he was\r\nsucceeded by Michael J. Drummond, one of the Emigrant Bank’s trustees.\r\nLike Mr. Mulry, Mr. Drummond is Irish-born, and is a former president of\r\nthe Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in the City of New York.\r\n\r\nThe individual thrift of the Irish has, indeed, been notable. Their\r\nfavorite investments have been in real estate and these, in thousands of\r\ninstances, have proved the foundation of the Irish fortunes of today.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Club has taken a notable place among the best institutions\r\nof the kind in the city; its membership is largely Irish stock.\r\n\r\nIn the public offices, the police and fire departments, the number of\r\nIrish-descended is very large. An idea is abroad that this is wholly in\r\nconsequence of the adherence of the Irish population to the fortunes of\r\nthe political organization known as Tammany Hall, but it is only a\r\nhalf-truth. Tammany Hall, during a great part of its history, has been\r\nthe “regular” Democracy, and that was enough for many who had grown up\r\nwith it, but the forces of revolt from within the Democratic party have\r\nfrequently overthrown Tammany, and it was generally Irish names that\r\nthen came to the front. The late Mayor William H. Grace is an instance.\r\nIn the recent election Tammany met a pretty general defeat, but its\r\nIrish-descended nominee for mayor, William H. Gaynor, was elected, and\r\nforemost among those of the victorious opposition, who will share the\r\ngreat city’s government with him, are William A. Prendergast, son of\r\nIrish parents, as Comptroller; George McAneny as president of the\r\nBorough of Manhattan, and John Purroy Mitchel, grandson of John Mitchel,\r\nthe famous Irish patriot of 1848, as President of the aldermen. In the\r\ncivil service examinations the Irish hold their own and more, so that\r\nwhatever political party may be in power the racial ratio in New York’s\r\npublic offices is not likely to change for many years to come, where\r\nmerit and moral and physical fitness are at all the test of appointment.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to point to great individual instances of successful\r\nIrishmen in the wholesale and the greater retail business of the city,\r\nbut enough has been said here to show how strong is the hold of the\r\nIrish here and how great their stake in the fortune and wealth of the\r\ncity. Nevertheless, one may well be surprised to note how little that is\r\ndistinctly Irish, as apart from Catholic or Protestant, Democrat or\r\nRepublican (to mention a couple of lines of emotional and rational\r\ncleavage), meets the eye in the city’s edifices or public monuments. In\r\nthe churchyard of St. Paul’s Protestant Episcopal Church are three\r\nnotable monuments—a monolith to the memory of Thomas Addis Emmet,\r\nanother to the memory of Dr. William James MacNevin, and a monument in\r\nthe wall of the church itself over General Montgomery of Revolutionary\r\nfame. In Trinity churchyard is the tomb of Robert Fulton. In Central\r\nPark there is a bust of Thomas Moore, the Irish poet. The list ends\r\nsomewhere there—pretty meagrely.\r\n\r\nThere are and have been many Irish societies, patriotic, social,\r\nbenevolent, literary and musical, but although the existence of one runs\r\nback over a century and a quarter and has always included in its ranks\r\nthe most flourishing of Ireland’s sons, without any regard to politics\r\nor religion, it has never owned a home of its own. Like the others, it\r\nis housed from occasion to occasion wherever the choice of its officers\r\nmay lead it, yet it has long owned a considerable building fund. Another\r\nbody, large in numbers, is understood to own a building site, but there\r\nthe matter rests. This, to the lover of Ireland, is not an encouraging\r\ncondition. One would expect to see a number of splendid edifices devoted\r\nto Irish social, scientific and artistic objects. One would expect to\r\nsee fine monuments in public places to the great men of Irish-American\r\nhistory—such even as those late-comers, the Italians, have erected to\r\ntheir countrymen, to wit: the fine Columbus pillar, the Garibaldi, the\r\nVerdi and the Verazzano monuments.\r\n\r\nShould there not be a trumpet note of change sounded over these glaring\r\ndeficiencies? Should not there be at least one great Celtic Institute\r\nfounded with a large and imposing auditorium for Irish gatherings, and\r\nwith suites of rooms and smaller assembly halls for such organizations\r\nas the American-Irish Historical Society’s New York Chapter, for the\r\nGaelic, the literary, the artistic, musical, benevolent and social Irish\r\norganizations of the city not religious in character? It is easily\r\nwithin the reach of accomplishment. It but needs the effort of a few of\r\nthe really rich and public-spirited men of Irish blood to give it the\r\nproper financial basis and provide thereafter for its economical\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nAmong other things it would insure the much-neglected history of our\r\nrace in New York a chance to be the object of real service, instead of\r\nas now, the hobby of comparatively few.\r\n\r\nIn another particular a deficiency is noted, which there is at present\r\nsome effort making among the churches to supply, namely, a care for the\r\nsocial welfare, for the spread of uplifting, refining influences among\r\nthe young men and women of the Irish race after they have finished their\r\nterms at school. Local Homes for the Irish young men and women informed\r\nin their directorates with intelligent, animating spirit, should\r\nflourish all over New York. The Y. M. C. A. has sufficiently blazed the\r\nway. It is a great and inviting work. Such life could be given to these\r\nHomes that their attraction would be irresistible. The good they would\r\ndo, the results they would achieve for civic uplift and domestic and\r\nsocial refinement would well repay all they would cost in money and\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nTo kindred objects the New York Irish have been continual givers rather\r\nthan large donors in the American sense, but last year the gift of\r\n$4,500,000 by John M. Burke, of New York, for founding and endowing a\r\nHome for Convalescents indicates that the rich Celt is falling into the\r\nline of broad and bold American philanthropy. What more vital to the\r\nstanding and the future of the race in New York can be thought of than a\r\ngreat Celtic Institute or the Neighborhood Homes as outlined above?\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the case of the Irish immigration of the past sixty\r\nyears the material had to be taken as it came to these shores, and that\r\nnot everything could be done with it, or for it, at once; but the\r\nsituation is no longer the same. Looking over the external sources of\r\nfuture population for the whole United States, as well as for New York\r\nCity, it becomes pretty evident that the Irish race will not furnish any\r\nbut a diminishing quota; that the future of the Irish race in America\r\ndepends almost entirely on the Irish already here. It is also true that\r\nthe social condition of the Irish stock is bettering every day. Other\r\nEuropean races, broadly speaking, are doing the laborers’ work of the\r\ncountry as well as the city. The Irish millionaire, the Irish captain of\r\nindustry, the Irish leader in thought and education is largely\r\nrepresented here. We produce great laymen as well as great clerics, and\r\nit becomes daily more incumbent on the prosperous to turn with the open\r\npurse and the hand of uplift to the less favored by fortune, in order\r\nthat they may make hereafter for the fame and condition of the race in\r\nAmerica. That there is a tendency among the very well-to-do children and\r\ngrandchildren of the Irish immigrants away from Irish association is\r\nlargely true. It is so with German-descended in a degree, as to their\r\nracial fellows, but these latter did not have behind them the history of\r\nbitter, poverty-smitten struggles for a foothold here, which befel the\r\nbulk of the Irish immigration. The Germans came from a prosperous land,\r\nseeking greater prosperity. Even the poorest Italians, coming from a\r\nhungering country, bring with them the dower of a historic past, rich\r\nwith the highest artistic embellishment and spiritual fulfilment. Back\r\nof the Irish immigration was an immediate past of hunger, oppression,\r\nintolerance and passionate, ineffectual revolt, and long vague memories\r\nof distant splendors that came to them, partly in legend and partly in\r\nthe ruins of pillar-towers, castles, abbeys and half-obliterated\r\ncarvings over graves. Out of these legends and these ruins and graves\r\ncame to them the true whisperings of the race. The Celtic renaissance in\r\nIreland itself grows because these whisperings are a little better\r\nheard. A like cultivation may follow here if the race is true to itself.\r\nIt is within the memory of many like myself that to be Irish has taken\r\non a substantial social consideration but grudgingly accorded thirty or\r\nforty years ago. So many have arrived at fortune, have done great public\r\nservice, have attained social heights that it becomes a matter of social\r\nself-defense with them to see that no child of their race shall lack for\r\nthe incentive and something of the opportunity to enter and carry on the\r\nbattle of life under inspiring conditions.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to visualise the Irish share in New York itself, the\r\npreceding considerations appear to be as necessary as the mere record of\r\nmighty numbers and massed achievement, but enough has, perhaps, been\r\nsaid to show that, by and large, the Irish here have survived their\r\ngreatest trials, have largely developed the civic virtues and reached a\r\nplane of prosperity inferior to no race on the continent. They are\r\none-fourth of New York’s population, and probably hold almost an equally\r\nhigh fraction of its personal wealth, bating, of course, that enormous\r\nincrement which comes to the metropolis from its commanding position as\r\nthe continental centre of investment. May the Irish chapter of New York\r\nin the next fifty years be more inspiring still.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HOW THE CELEBRATION TOOK SHAPE.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while looking into the way the celebration shaped itself.\r\nMuch was written about it as it occurred. In a general way its story is\r\ncommon property, and its great success is history. The centennial of\r\nRobert Fulton’s most notable achievement—the first voyage of his\r\nsteamboat up the Hudson—fell in the year 1907. It did not pass without\r\nnotice at the time, but the proposal to make it the central point of a\r\nmunicipal festival at once brought to mind that in another two years\r\n(namely, in 1909) would occur the ter-centenary of Henry Hudson’s\r\ndiscovery and navigation of the great river. Here then, was a chance for\r\na dual display. The recent date and comparative failure of the St. Louis\r\nExposition, combined with New York’s distaste for the prolonged\r\ninattention to its real business involved in an international\r\nexposition, decided against the exposition idea. A commission, to be\r\ncalled after the two men whose memory the celebration was to honor, was\r\nformed by Act of the Legislature. It was given a large fund by the\r\nState. New York City followed with another large sum, and private local\r\npatriotism and civic pride followed with large subscriptions. The\r\ncommission was well-founded and amply funded. At its head was placed the\r\nveteran soldier, lawyer, Congressman, diplomatist and man of affairs,\r\nGeneral Stewart L. Woodford, whose courtly presence, gentle bearing,\r\nhandsome face, white hair and beard gave a pictorial dignity to the\r\noffice hard to find elsewhere. But the active leadership, the real\r\nworking headship of this affair great in scope and multifariousness,\r\nfell upon Hermann Ridder, a New-York-born German-American of great\r\nexecutive skill, whose resolute uprise in the world of journalism and\r\nwhose wide acquaintance with the city, social, racial, religious,\r\nindustrial and financial, bespoke his fitness. To aid him were appointed\r\nmany men of standing in the city, but while they came and went at his\r\ncall, and attended this meeting and that, one and all they agreed that\r\nsince the work had fallen on such competent shoulders there they would\r\ncarefully allow it to remain. Mr. Ridder took up the burden and carried\r\nit, carried it through. He shirked nothing, he directed everything, he\r\norganized his staff of helpers, artistic and clerical, and kept them\r\nbusy. He looked after the formation of the working committees who would\r\nwork out the enormous detail which the naval, military, police, social,\r\nartistic and publicity problems involved. Then he let the committees\r\nwork, and wisely dealt with results. So, he kept an even keel, if one\r\nmight put it that way, amid the occasional storms that will arise in\r\nsuch cases. The city surely owes him something for his whole-hearted\r\ndevotion and unwearying service that did not cost the city a cent, and\r\ninsured the memorable success of a great festival worthy of the greatest\r\ncity on the continent, all the sooner for his work, perhaps, to be the\r\ngreatest city in the world.\r\n\r\nThe celebration, then, was arranged on a scale more elaborate than\r\nanything theretofore undertaken by an American municipality, and in this\r\nthe Commission was seconded by the wonderful natural setting of the\r\ncity, fronting the expanse of the harbor and with broad rivers on either\r\nside of the long tongue of land—Manhattan—that gently uplifts its\r\nserried lines of stately homes and massive buildings, from South to\r\nNorth. One of these rivers, the Hudson, a stream noble in itself and the\r\nscene of the great suggestive feats of Henry Hudson and Robert Fulton,\r\ninvited special attention. It was, therefore, early decided that New\r\nYork’s tribute to these two great men and grand memories should share\r\nits functions between land and water. Accordingly while a section of the\r\nCommission planned land decorations, parades, assemblies, illuminations\r\nand banquets to fill an entire week, the officers busied themselves\r\nfirst with the Federal government at Washington to invite the naval\r\npowers of the world to send warships wreathed in flowers, as it were,\r\nand asking for a mighty squadron of our own ocean thunderers to greet\r\nthe armored Tritons from oversea. Then Holland, in whose service Henry\r\nHudson sailed the blue waters, offered a gift of unique kind, namely a\r\nduplicate of the little ship, Half Moon, in which Hudson traversed the\r\nAtlantic and ascended the river that has rightly come to bear his name.\r\nIt was not strange, then, that the Commission should resolve to build a\r\nreplica of that other historic craft, the Clermont, in which Fulton\r\nfirst went up the same river under steam.\r\n\r\nFrom these starting points it was not so difficult to outline the rest\r\nof the water programme. There should be a ceremony of receiving the two\r\nhistoric craft down the bay and conducting them in a mighty parade\r\nconsisting of all the steam craft plying the nearby waters, ranged in a\r\nfair flotilla up Hudson’s River passing the long range of seven miles of\r\nwarships and, after a ceremony of reception, returning in like order to\r\ntheir berths and piers. There should be on land and water a grand\r\nillumination by night with fireworks of the most spectacular kind. There\r\nshould again be a beautiful water pageant when the Half Moon and the\r\nClermont were escorted up the river that the towns and cities along its\r\nbanks might partake of the glory of the time. They would let the\r\nprocession of ships from New York end their pilgrimage at Newburg and\r\nthere let another flotilla conduct the memorial ships to Albany where\r\nthe river narrows and shoals. So was the unique water side of the\r\ncelebration outlined. For the land side the preparations were on an\r\nequally grand scale, but here they were dealing with more familiar\r\nmaterial. We had had festival parades of like kind before; now we were\r\nto have more of them than ever and each one to be more marvellous of its\r\nkind than anything before conceived. No less than three great\r\nprocessions were arranged—a grand civic procession illustrating in\r\nfloats three centuries of New York’s history, and made up of the men of\r\nthe forty races and nationalities of which our population is compounded;\r\na military parade to display every branch of our army service, state and\r\nnational, and in which details of sailors and marines from the foreign\r\nwarships as well as our own, should paradoxically testify to\r\ninternational brotherly love by marching peacefully together armed to\r\nthe teeth. Lastly was designed a Carnival parade—a night march, devoted\r\nto artistic symbols on illuminated floats and conducted by costumed\r\nthousands from the German, Austrian and Swiss societies of the City.\r\n\r\nIt was natural to call on the city to drape and decorate its buildings\r\nlavishly, to arrange for general illumination: to design a finely\r\npillared Court of Honor on Fifth Avenue just below 42d St. and hang it\r\nwith mazes of electric lights, to erect a grand reviewing stand facing\r\nthe Avenue and with its back to the great Library Building just emerged\r\nfrom its scaffolding.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, many minor suggestions follow on the heels of the great\r\nones, and the week of wonders threatened to extend indefinitely. A\r\nnotable loan collection of paintings of the Dutch school was assembled\r\nfor exhibition at the Museum of Art, a rare collection of Colonial\r\nfurniture was also secured. Then came a reception with oratory at the\r\nMetropolitan Opera House, an Irish concert at Carnegie Hall, an opera\r\nhouse music festival, aquatic sports, an exhibition of flying machines\r\nand a beautiful open air fête for 40,000 school children in the parks.\r\n\r\nIn a retrospect for our particular purpose, it is as well to grasp in\r\nsome such general way the chief features of the event. For the year in\r\nwhich it had been actually incubating New York heard little and did not\r\ncare much about it, and wakened very gradually to the great festal\r\nproportions it was to take. In fact people were returning to New York\r\nfrom mountain and seaside after the heats of Summer before they clearly\r\nunderstood how much was afoot in the way of civic entertainment. New\r\nYork’s self-consciousness differs from that of every other American\r\ncity. There is, for instance, no feeling that its greatness needs\r\nproclamation. It is not worried about its growth: it has been always\r\ngrowing. It is imaginatively undisturbed about its future: it is too\r\nbusy to trouble about its past. Perhaps it has never taken to any civic\r\nphrase more kindly than describing itself as “little old New York,”\r\nwhile it knows it is not little, and if it has any municipal thrill it\r\nis over its modernity. Here was something coming which might be thought\r\nof as an attempt to awaken “the Chicago feeling” in Gotham—that is a\r\nsomewhat delirious sensation of the bumptious and divinely ordained, the\r\nthrobbing of the inflamed nerve of Destiny. In a way of its own New York\r\ngave way to it. The city began to hum, and when the time came in\r\nSeptember’s days of warm colors and genial airs the people were ready to\r\ncheer, to march, to sail in line, to celebrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                ORGANIZATION OF THE IRISH PARTICIPATION.\r\n\r\nIt was during the months of the previous springtime that the Irish share\r\nin the celebration took shape, when Hermann Ridder met the\r\nrepresentatives of the Irish societies, and stating briefly but clearly\r\nthe general plan of the celebration, called for 10,000 Irishmen to take\r\npart in the Historical civic parade. And to this they agreed. In a\r\ncompendious sketch he described the divisions of the procession and the\r\nhistorical floats that were to make part of each—the Indian period, the\r\nDutch period, the Colonial period, the Revolutionary period, the Modern\r\nperiod. Over forty nationalities besides the native American were to be\r\nrepresented. To the Irish he conceded the right of the line. To them\r\nwould be assigned certain historic floats. In the upbuilding of New York\r\nMr. Ridder recognized that the immigrants from Europe had contributed\r\nthe major share. In other words it had been fed with population mainly\r\nfrom oversea. Of the original Dutch stock but a trace remained: it had\r\nlargely scattered or died out. The early English stock had similarly\r\npassed on. The influx from rural America or other American towns and\r\ncities had been constant and latterly was increasing. Still the\r\nimmigrant and the children of the immigrant preponderated in the great\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ROBERT FULTON ESQ^R\r\n\r\n  From a Celebrated Picture through the Courtesy of Vice-President\r\n    Joseph I. C. Clarke\r\n  of New York.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe American Irish Historical Society, through its New York chapter,\r\ntook part in the earliest gatherings. The Friendly Sons of St. Patrick\r\nin the City of New York, the oldest Irish organization in the country\r\nwith a history of 126 years behind it, was also early in the field. Its\r\nPresident, William Temple Emmet, was chosen chairman of the gathering of\r\nIrish societies and Alfred J. Talley of the American Irish Historical\r\nSociety was elected Secretary. First and last some eighty Irish\r\nsocieties answered to the call. Broadly these were the Ancient Order of\r\nHibernians, the Clan-na-Gael, the Irish American Athletic Club, the\r\nIrish Counties Athletic Clubs, the two societies named above and a\r\nnumber of Gaelic and Literary societies. There appeared at first to be\r\nno difficulty whatever about furnishing the quota called for: indeed\r\nthere was some claim that less than 12,000 would be inadequate, judging\r\nfrom the muster rolls of all the societies desiring to participate. So\r\nthere was some indignant protest when it was learned later that on\r\naccount of the inordinate length of time it would take to get the\r\nprocession past a given point on the basis first laid down, the Irish\r\ncontingent would necessarily be cut down to 5,000 men. Eventually it was\r\nrecognized that this was just as well. It developed curiously that the\r\nIrish in New York are not as numerously organized as they would seem.\r\nWhen they get the Society habit they are likely to belong to many\r\nsocieties, and this possibly multiplies by four their apparent number.\r\nMany of the delegates belonged to half a dozen of the societies\r\nrepresented. Naturally they could march with only one. The falling off\r\nfrom this cause was most noticeable with the Ancient Order of\r\nHibernians—numerically the largest on its lodge rolls.\r\n\r\nCommittees of various kinds were appointed and to one—the\r\nHistorical—fell the lot of securing the appropriate floats to escort in\r\nthe procession. It was obvious that they should claim the Clermont\r\nfloat, for was not Robert Fulton the American-born son of an Irish\r\nfather and Irish mother? It was equally obvious that they should claim\r\nthe Erie Canal float with which the name of Governor De Witt Clinton,\r\nalso of Irish descent and one-time Mayor of New York was inseparably\r\nconnected. In some predacious way the Scotch societies had secured the\r\nFulton Ferry float, claiming Fulton to be a Scottish name. It was seen\r\nby the Historical Committee that an omission of a grave kind had been\r\nmade by the designers of the floats in not having one to celebrate the\r\ngiving of the first charter to the City of New York by Governor Dongan—a\r\ncharter always quoted with approval by the commentators on New York’s\r\ncivic history. Now Dongan was a fine official of well-balanced mind, a\r\nlearned man and an Irishman, and his appointment came from King James\r\nII, who did not object to him as Irish and gave him the place because he\r\nwas a Catholic as well as otherwise qualified. The Commission agreed to\r\nrectify its omission and ordered a Dongan float. The Clermont, Erie\r\nCanal and Dongan floats were thereafter assigned to the Irish societies,\r\nto man and to escort.\r\n\r\nMuch amusing detail might be added to this but it can be indicated in\r\nthe joyous way in which Martin Sheridan, the great athlete and champion\r\nhurler of the discus, was chosen to impersonate Robert Fulton and John\r\nFlanagan, the giant hammer-thrower of the Irish Athletic club, was named\r\nfor the engineer. Thomas P. Tuite, whose admirable sketch of the life of\r\nFulton is one of the memorable outcomes of the celebration, was\r\nenthusiastically impressed to act as steersman of the Erie Canal barge.\r\nWith the Dongan float there was a difficulty. Major E. T. McCrystal,\r\neditor and soldier, was easily persuaded to stand for Governor Dongan,\r\nand it was not hard to get representatives for the New York councilmen\r\nwho were to accept the charter, but when it came to getting\r\nimpersonators for a file of British soldiers in red coats who were to\r\nstand as representatives of the British monarchy, there was indignation\r\nand revolt. Finally the British soldiers were cut out, and Dongan\r\ntendered his charter without any red-coated backing. The choosing of the\r\nladies for the floats was wisely left to some ladies’ societies.\r\n\r\nThe best idea that came of the work of the Irish committees was that of\r\na concert of Irish music. It was brought forward by Jeremiah Lawlor, of\r\nthe Ancient Order of Hibernians, and ardently worked for by him. Once\r\npresented to the Hudson-Fulton Commission it was given a place on the\r\nofficial programme. Fortunately Victor Herbert, the distinguished\r\noperatic composer and orchestra leader, was at hand, and instantly\r\naccepted the concert committee’s invitation to take charge of the\r\nprogramme. It involved some sacrifice on his part but he gladly made it,\r\nand the success of the result must certainly have compensated him.\r\n\r\nIt was in the springtime, too, that another Irish feature of the\r\ncelebration was arranged, the chartering of the splendid Sandy Hook\r\nsteamer, Asbury Park, for the naval parade up the Hudson River. The\r\nAmerican-Irish Historical Society and the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick\r\ncoöperated in this—at a cost of $5,000 for the use of the steamer for\r\nthat single day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                RECEPTION OF THE HALF MOON AND CLERMONT.\r\n\r\nThe last week in September is apt to be blessed with fine, mild weather\r\nin New York, and this time it held good. No more beautiful day could be\r\nwished than Saturday, September 25, 1909, when the banks of the Hudson\r\nRiver for ten miles from its mouth became the vantage ground for many\r\nmore than a million sightseers, with the great stream itself a Broadway\r\nof the water over which the floating procession was to pass. Toward the\r\nCity shore the long line of the gathered warships stretched adrape with\r\ngay bunting. Behind the water-front packed with human beings from the\r\nBattery Park to Grant’s tomb and beyond, rose the great mass of the\r\ncity, its lifted turrets and spires and its soaring buildings forming a\r\nmajestic background. Power spoke in every line and mass that met the\r\neye, and beauty of a kind seldom seen gave its impress of delight. Down\r\nthe harbor, the fleet of steamers was gathering in its hundreds, every\r\ncraft from great Hudson River and Sound steamers and private yachts to\r\nsquadron upon squadron of tugs. All were flag-draped and all were laden\r\nwith joy-bound participants. The Brooklyn shore down to Fort Hamilton at\r\nthe Narrows, and the heights and shore of Staten Island from Fort\r\nWadsworth curving around the harbor were black with human beings. Hard\r\nby the Kill von Kull lay the Half Moon and the Clermont, the one a\r\nquaint, picturesque ghost of the great days of adventure of the early\r\nseventeenth century, the other in its long square ugliness a reminder\r\nthat adventure with steam power in a new element was concerned with\r\nfitness and not with beauty; that Fulton was thinking of the turning of\r\nhis ridiculous paddle wheels rather than the looks of things. And on the\r\nDutch craft stood a make-believe Henry Hudson with a Dutch crew clad in\r\nthe sea-dogs’ garments of his time. What a dim, pathetic figure that\r\nreal Hudson of whom here was the twentieth century shadow. He must have\r\nbeen a man of grim purpose and of strong flesh and blood, but never did\r\na man so near our time fade out into the mist more completely than he\r\nwho first sent the prow of a white man’s ship up past the Palisades and\r\nthe Highlands. On the Clermont was also a goodly company rigged out in\r\nthe habiliments of 1807 that still bore something of the lines of the\r\ndandies of Paris in the time of the Directory. But it was a man of\r\nRobert Fulton’s blood who impersonated the creator of the first\r\nsteamship that could truly navigate, and that meant that there was Irish\r\nblood in him.\r\n\r\nIt was when the procession in the course of the afternoon began to move\r\nwith our long slim darting torpedo boats escorting the Half-Moon and the\r\nClermont and all the other steam craft following that the true glory of\r\nthe day began, and as the vessels swung into line heading northward\r\nevery piston-beat of the engines, every turn of the churning screws and\r\nsplashing paddles seemed to make a chorus of Fulton! Fulton! Fulton! and\r\nin a precious undertone to many a thousand of the onlookers it murmured\r\nIreland! Ireland! Ireland! whence came the brain that had put a heart of\r\ngiant power into every floating fortress, every giant of the\r\ntransatlantic trade that the great flotilla passed as it swept up the\r\nriver. As the little ship of Hudson and the ungainly master-boat of\r\nFulton passed, the fleets of the world saluted them. So they passed up,\r\nacclaimed from the banks and the stream, the Half-Moon and the Clermont\r\nhalting at the picturesque water gate on the Riverside slope for the\r\nreception ceremonies where the dignitaries waited from the Governor of\r\nNew York state down.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE ILLUMINATIONS ON WATER AND LAND.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of those afloat it was a sail nearly to Yonkers before the\r\nlast of the United States battleships was passed, and the turning point\r\nreached. By this time the evening was falling rapidly in a glory of\r\ncrimson sunset that made the river glow as paven with red gold, the\r\nPalisades rising black as ebony against the west, and the lingering rays\r\nfalling in warm ivory and pale pink on the white house-line of New York\r\non its hills farther down the stream. But as the light paled, and the\r\nshadows filled with purple and presently when a misty greyness was\r\ncoming over all on land and water, another glory began which was to\r\ngladden and grow until it made a great picture that perhaps the world\r\nhad never seen and certainly the world of Columbus and Hudson and Fulton\r\nhad never witnessed before—the festal lighting on water and on land.\r\n\r\nLucky were those in that day procession up the river whose craft could\r\nlinger in the upper reaches until all the glory of night was ablaze. The\r\nwarships outlined in strings of electric lamps, the lights on the moving\r\ncraft, the monuments on shore brilliantly set off with skeleton tracing\r\nof light, building after building on both sides of the river glowing\r\nwith electric lights in every fantasy of device and color, the houses\r\none and all lit up at every window, the tower of Madison Square one\r\nmighty shaft of light. Farther South the sky-piercing tower of the\r\nSinger building like a glowing mural crown dominated the vast field of\r\nthe twenty-story office buildings, all illuminated to their roofs. In\r\nthe harbor the Liberty Statue shone in an island of light. Up the East\r\nRiver a special glory was seen with its three great bridges spanning the\r\nstream in glittering cobwebs of light that hung between the water and\r\nthe sky. All the buildings on the New York and Brooklyn shores swam in a\r\nshimmering golden haze. The avenues were long lines of diamonds strung\r\nfrom pillar to pillar, and then to the north a wonderful aurora of\r\nfan-spread search-lights, and from a dozen points over the island and\r\nthe rivers spouted, great fountains of fireworks storming the heavens\r\nwith jets of colored fire. It was fascinating, intoxicating, and the\r\nmillions watched it in a daze from nightfall until midnight when at last\r\nthe city and the river were left to the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE IRISH CONCERT.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, September 26, New York was fain to rest from its long outing\r\nof Saturday. When, however, night had fallen there was no fatigue\r\nvisible in the smiling faces that gathered for the Irish Concert in\r\nCarnegie Hall. In securing the hearty coöperation of Victor Herbert, the\r\nfamous composer and orchestra leader, the committee had armed itself for\r\na triumph. Mr. Herbert is Irish-born, and of true Irish stock, a\r\ngrandson of Samuel Lover, the Irish novelist and ballad writer whose\r\n“Low-backed Car” and “Rory O’Moore” threaten to outlive most of the\r\nlyrics of his generation. In Germany he received his musical education\r\nwhich was thorough. As a student of harmony and counterpoint none\r\nsurpassed him in avidity to master all that the best could impart.\r\nLearning successively to play well nigh every instrument in the\r\norchestra, he became proficient on the violoncello, acting as solo\r\nvioloncellist in the Royal Court orchestra at Stuttgart, and taking a\r\nhigh rank as a virtuoso. When he came to this country in 1886 it was to\r\ntake the important post of solo violoncellist under Anton Seidl, the\r\ngreat Wagnerian conductor at the Metropolitan opera house. His German\r\nwas so good that musical people around Fortieth street wondered “how\r\nwell the Dutchman spoke English,” a curious reversal of Lever’s humorous\r\nconceit: “I knew by your French you were English, and I knew by your\r\nEnglish you were Irish.” Herbert, however, was not long in the land of\r\nthe free before his Irish heart made itself known to his fellow-Gaels,\r\nand ever since it has beat in unison with them. In music he heard a\r\nhigher call than being a prominent figure among the instrumentalists of\r\neven so famous a Wagnerian as Anton Seidl. When Patrick Sarsfield\r\nGilmore, of loving musical memory, passed away, it was Victor Herbert\r\nwho was called to succeed him as bandmaster of the 22d regiment, and\r\nthereafter waved the magical baton of Gilmore’s wonderful band. To this\r\nhe added the duties of Kappellmeister to Anton Seidl’s orchestra and to\r\nthe famous organization of Theodore Thomas. In 1898 he obeyed a call to\r\nPittsburg to head a great orchestra, and remained there six years, his\r\npower and talent developing all the while. Returning to New York he\r\nrecruited an orchestra of his own which soon won popular and critical\r\nesteem. But his forte lay in musical composition. The immediate road to\r\nsuccess and fortune was, to his mind, by the way of comic opera, and\r\nwork after work of this nature came sparkling from his brain to the joy\r\nof multitudes and to his own rapid enrichment. Still he led his now\r\nfamous orchestra all over the land, working day and night, for he loved\r\nhis work. The ambition to do greater things, however, never left him,\r\nand passing from mere facile outpouring of the riches of his inspiration\r\nhe turned to the higher work in the realm of music. His oratorio, “The\r\nCaptive,” a fine work, first heard at the Worcester (Mass.) musical\r\nfestival was highly praised. Many of his serious fugitive pieces became\r\npopular with musicians and the world of music awaits with pleasant\r\nanticipation the grand opera into which he has for some time been\r\nputting his soul. He has for years been a member of the Friendly Sons of\r\nSt. Patrick, always prompt to make the musical features of its\r\ngatherings notable, and always lending freely of his geniality to its\r\nsymposiums of good fellowship.\r\n\r\nBear with me for this straying into the paths of biography, for Victor\r\nHerbert’s personality, his training, and his Irish birthright should be\r\nknown to every son of Ireland in America, not merely as a matter of race\r\npride but of race inspiration. We pride ourselves on our love of music.\r\nThe echoes of the olden Celtic harps must be in our souls, but we have\r\ndone little enough as a people to deserve the exquisite heritage. Our\r\ninnate love of the art should be broadly cultivated and steadily\r\ndeveloped, and in Victor Herbert I see a man who may yet do something\r\ngreat in this way for his race and ours, as he is sure to do in lofty\r\ncomposition for his own enduring fame. That is why I have dwelt on his\r\nstriking career. In securing his hearty interest in the Irish Concert\r\nsuccess was assured, for it brought with it the services of the\r\nmagnificent orchestra trained for years under the sway of his relentless\r\nbaton.\r\n\r\nWe do not lack for solo artists of merit and skill, but in choral music\r\nwe have not done all we could. In Ireland a modern school of composers\r\nis doing work of which we know little here. The mending of this should\r\nbe a first step in the Irish musical renaissance. If we find poets to\r\nwrite the books and lyrics, and musicians to compose the vibrant\r\nmeasures to fit them, we must have singers to interpret them and\r\ninstrumentalists to give them the breadth and depth of the full artistic\r\ninspiration. Let the little band of sixty or seventy (little as choral\r\nrenderings go in these days) who came together from the Catholic\r\nOratorio Society for the Irish Concert be the melodious forerunners of\r\nIrish choral societies that may gather thousands at a time in one burst\r\nof song. At the Irish Concert the chorus sang admirably. May every\r\nmember thereof be blessed for her or his participation, and their\r\nexample give heart to a new musical impulse among our people.\r\n\r\nThe great house was filled to its capacity with a representative Irish\r\ngathering and presented a fine picture of comely women and handsome men.\r\nThe Hudson-Fulton Celebration Commission had given the concert official\r\nplace in its programme; the visiting guests of the Commission were\r\ninvited. Governor Hughes of the State of New York, who boasts of Irish\r\nblood, and our one-time mayor and one-time president of Columbia\r\nCollege, Seth Low, as chairman of the Commission’s reception committee,\r\noccupied with the governor’s staff the central box on the grand tier. It\r\nwas a “warm house,” then, that greeted the entry of the orchestra and\r\nthe chorus on the broad stage, and listened raptly to what proved a fine\r\nconcert of Irish music, deserving all the applause it received. And this\r\nwas the programme:—\r\n\r\n  1. Overture—“Maritana,”                                _W. V. Wallace_\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Orchestra.=\r\n\r\n\r\n  2.

Anthem—“The Star Spangled Banner”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Orchestra and Chorus.=\r\n\r\nSingers and players performed delightfully. Mrs. O’Donnell, Madame\r\nKronold and William Ludwig—that famous veteran of the German opera and\r\ngreat interpreter of Irish ballads—all won new laurels. Mr. Ludwig’s\r\nrendition of the spirited song by John J. Rooney, author of so many fine\r\nlyrics and ballads, was particularly impressive. But it was the work of\r\nVictor Herbert’s orchestra that lifted the occasion to its real height.\r\nThe performance of Villiers Stanford’s Irish symphony and Herbert’s own\r\nIrish rhapsody was as true and fine as could be conceived, and in every\r\nway worthy of the brilliant compositions themselves. The chorus gave the\r\nBalfe lyric and “Oft in the Stilly Night” with fine shading and their\r\nsinging of “The Fenian War Song” won an encore that would not be denied.\r\n\r\nAs a whole the concert gave an impression profoundly gratifying to all\r\nconnected with it. I have said that it was conceived in the first place\r\nby Jeremiah Lawlor. It is right to add that Major E. T. McCrystal,\r\nchairman of the Concert committee, worked hard with Mr. Lawlor for the\r\nresult achieved. To Mr. Lawlor, Seth Low wrote after the concert that he\r\nfound it “most enjoyable,” and added:—\r\n\r\n“The music itself was interesting, and it was rendered in a way worthy\r\nof all admiration. I think that those who have labored so hard for so\r\nmany years to awaken interest in Gaelic culture have not only done a\r\nservice for the members of the Irish race in this country, but, as\r\nillustrated by this really beautiful concert, they have rendered a\r\nvaluable service to the whole country.”\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to bear out Mr. Low, and to formulate the hope that the\r\nIrish Concert of that Sunday evening may be parent of great effort among\r\nour people to justify to themselves and the world their boasted love of\r\nthe art that made Ireland famous a thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE HISTORICAL PARADE.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, September 28, the weather in the morning held little promise\r\nof procession weather. It had rained, and in some degree dampened ardor,\r\nbut the meteoric luck of the celebration was to prevail and by noon the\r\nskies were opening, and just the right condition overhead and underfoot\r\nassured. The line of the three great processions, of which this was to\r\nbe the first, had been well chosen. Assembling north of Central Park the\r\nparade was to pass down the broad avenue of Central Park West, a\r\nstraight line of two miles and a half, turning east at 59th street for a\r\nshort half mile to Fifth avenue, then down the avenue a straight line\r\nfor another two miles and a half to the point of dispersal. For three\r\nmiles the parade was to pass between a succession of stands for\r\nspectators, with stands at every available point on Fifth avenue and the\r\ngrand stand in the Court of Honor at 42d street, as we have noted\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine and suggestive parade. The fifty great floats provided\r\nwith so much care did not, perhaps, come up in all things to\r\nexpectations. Cold daylight plays havoc with such expressions of\r\nhistoric symbolism. It shows the gilding, the high colors, the\r\nmake-believe material too unsparingly. It betrays the utter modernity of\r\nthe costumed posturers standing for legendary and historic figures.\r\nPerhaps this was not the view of the cheering thousands as the floats\r\npassed by. Art-knowledge makes one hypercritical and art-smattering\r\nmakes one expect too much. Let us take it as it seemed to the\r\nmultitude—the heroism of history on wheels.\r\n\r\nBut the parade, on its really inspiring side, was its men. As phalanx\r\nafter phalanx passed by at a marching step one felt the greatness of the\r\nland that had beckoned to the peoples of the world with such commanding\r\ngesture that they had sent hither the flower of their manhood to share\r\nthe great heritage of democracy on a continent of unbounded opportunity.\r\nThere they were, the Irish, the Italian, the Teuton, the Magyar, the\r\nFrench, the Scotch, the Dutch, the English, the Czech, the Pole, the\r\nSlav, the Greek, the Syrian, the Dane, the Swede; and the man of the\r\ngreat conglomerate, the man of the evolving type—the American.\r\n\r\nAfter the line of splendid-looking mounted police, trim-built and firmly\r\nseated with many a Celtic face among them, marched on foot Hermann\r\nRidder and the Mayor—two contrasting figures—Ridder, tall and erect, the\r\nMayor short and dapper. Together they stepped the length of the way,\r\nboth beaming with fair satisfaction, the populace cheering and the band\r\nplaying.\r\n\r\nThen came a line of green, Irish flags with crownless harps of gold.\r\n\r\nThe Irish had the right of the line—the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick\r\n(with whom the American-Irish Historical Society marched) were at the\r\nhead of the parade, William Temple Emmet leading. Following came the\r\nAncient Order of Hibernians with many Irish banners and led by Thomas\r\nKelly. They wore wide-brimmed felt hats of military trim, and carried\r\nthemselves admirably. Band after band and phalanx after phalanx of this\r\nnationality or that came on, some like the Hungarians in marvels of\r\nhussar costume, others in military coats, the breasts covered with\r\nmultitudes of medals, won maybe at schutzenfest or turnverein, but\r\nprobably not in war.\r\n\r\nThe Clan-na-Gael made a gallant showing, and the Irish Athletic\r\nsocieties, headed by the redoubtable P. J. Conway, turned out in force,\r\nmarching with a free swing that caught the onlookers immensely. A\r\nfeature was the Tammany column—a thousand or more tall-hatted and\r\nfrock-coated stalwart, presentable men, with Charles F. Murphy at their\r\nhead. They paraded, be it understood, as representing the charitable and\r\nbenevolent and not the political side of the long-lived organization.\r\nThey were popular with the crowds.\r\n\r\nNotable was the passage of the Clermont float. It was well known to all\r\nthat Martin Sheridan and John Flannagan were to be there, and where\r\nthere was any doubt among the onlookers as to which was which, were not\r\nthe policemen along the route ready to tell them? “That’s Martin\r\nSheridan, the man in the bell-topper,” alluding to the remarkable\r\nheadgear under which the great athlete stood for the great inventor. So\r\nthe cheers billowed for the Clermont all the way, a cheer for Robert\r\nFulton and “a tiger, boys, for Martin!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE POLICE AND THEIR TASK.\r\n\r\nAnd as to those great-bodied policemen who held the swarming, sometimes\r\nobstreperous, but generally patient crowds in check, how finely they did\r\nit all. I would hesitate to say whether their faces or their accents\r\nindicated sixty or seventy per cent. of live Celtic blood in them, but\r\nit was not less than the lower figure, and may have been more than the\r\ngreater. They won golden opinions on every side and from all classes\r\nthat day, and for the many long, arduous days until the celebration was\r\nover. It was not merely to hold the line—a task calling for firmness,\r\ntact, strength and continuous good nature, but handling with skill the\r\nenormous crowds that filled the avenues when the processions had gone\r\nby, and all were rushing for their homes, filling to overflowing every\r\ncar-line, every elevated roadway, and particularly cramming to\r\ncongestion in the subway. In addition they had at all times to be\r\n“guide, philosopher and friend” to the full million of visitors new to\r\nmetropolitan ways and pavements. And that was a task in itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE MILITARY PARADE.\r\n\r\nFor Thursday, September 30, came another splendid day when the military\r\nparade made New York tingle with marching tunes and the rhythmic tramp\r\nof men. Here was something that always quickens the popular pulse. We\r\nhad seen many like it in this big, thrilling town, but none that\r\nsurpassed it. The primal impulse coming from the thought: “Here are our\r\ndefenders; here our men who face death for Fatherland,” has to answer,\r\nno doubt, for the cheers that greet the men at arms as they swing\r\nmarching by. When kingcraft added pomp, glitter and jingle to it and\r\ntamed the trumpet to sing a siren song, and patriotism fluttered flags\r\nabove it rich in color and hung on gold-tipped spears, the magic was\r\ncomplete. Yet this pageant showed us more in one way and less in\r\nanother. More, in the fact that it showed us thousands of soldiers and\r\narmed man o’ warsmen from many alien ships and lands—some time or other\r\nour possible enemies, our possible allies—but all keeping step with our\r\nown brave men in the name of a pictorial friendship and in the hope of\r\nan unbroken peace; above all paying this passing tribute to our city and\r\nour country. Less, in that it showed us the stripping off of the gauds\r\nand finery of war, bringing more directly home to us that war today will\r\nnone of these, but must keep the human material of battle in ready\r\nfighting trim. Glory was marching in khaki and scorned all gold galloon.\r\nOver the same path as the civic procession of Tuesday came Military\r\nGlory in its ranked and regimented thousands, giving something of the\r\nthought that if called on to take to the trenches or march to the attack\r\nby the time it reached Washington’s arch, the men would be ready. Thus\r\nit gave two distinct sensations to the hundreds of thousands who watched\r\nit, outside the particular thrills that came when some well-remembered\r\nor much-admired division of the troopers came tramping grimly by.\r\n\r\nOur Irish citizens enjoyed it immensely, for they knew when the\r\n“regulars” were passing that it was dotted all over with Irish faces;\r\nthat it was the army that Andrew Jackson gloried in; that Phil Sheridan,\r\nKearney, Meagher and a hundred other brilliant men of Irish blood and\r\nstrain had led on fields of death. Was not their own 69th there swinging\r\nalong as it had swung at any time in fifty years that the country\r\ncalled? It was, and gallantly held its own for drill and trim and\r\nsoldier bearing. Did they not warm to the thought that the Irish\r\nvolunteers were marching, men soldiering for the very love of it, and\r\ncherishing an olden hope that sometime, somewhere they might be allowed\r\nto charge a battery or storm a height for Ireland—Ireland far away, but\r\nIreland ever near to their hearts. And this thought gave friendliness to\r\ntheir hail of the French marines and the French sailors, for the French\r\nhad been Ireland’s friend as well as America’s in the old troubled\r\ntimes, and many a one lilted under his breath “Oh, the French are on the\r\nsea, says the Shan van Vocht” when the Gallic tri-color went dancing\r\npast. These thoughts made it seem tolerable that the English were in the\r\nline and went so far as to let them give the Germans a cheer or two, and\r\nextending various degrees of approval to Italians, Brazilians and\r\nArgentines. But the West Point cadets! There, the innate love of the\r\nfighting man by the fighting race found intimate appeal. Many the Irish\r\ncaptain, great in the battlefield, had learned the grim trade in that\r\nbattalion, and now to see how fine and supple yet tense they seemed, how\r\nsuperbly they marched, how arrowlike their alignment, how wonderfully\r\nthey wheeled or countermarched, and the bands playing through it all. It\r\nwas a glorious day for all who took part and all who looked on.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE NAVAL PARADE.\r\n\r\nAnother day on the water came with Friday, October 1, and the weather\r\nagain was all that could be wished. Early the excursion steamers took on\r\ntheir loads, for the route was long of the Naval Parade. Shorn of the\r\nhundreds of tugboats and small craft that had swarmed the water on the\r\nSaturday before, it was a powerful and select squadron that turned its\r\nprows upstream to escort the Half Moon and the Clermont as far as\r\nNewburg, fifty-five miles above New York. The torpedo boats and a couple\r\nof the new sub-marines formed the governmental escorting party—the very\r\nold and the very new thus touching sides—and then came over one hundred\r\npowerful craft in line, decked in vari-colored bunting and with bands\r\nplaying. It was a splendid sight, as passing the war ships they swept on\r\nbeyond Manhattan island up the broad, deep stream. Commander Peary on\r\nhis stout ship, Roosevelt, freshly arrived that morning from the North\r\nand his conquest of the Pole, received the tribute of the thousands in\r\nthe procession. The dark rocky masses of the Palisades, now glowing here\r\nand there with autumn foliage, towered on the left, and on the right lay\r\nthe river towns set amid fields and woods.\r\n\r\nMany a flag of Ireland fluttered from the upper works of the great swift\r\nsteamer “Asbury Park” on which had gathered some nine hundred of the\r\nFriendly Sons of St. Patrick and the American-Irish Historical Society\r\nwith their families and friends. Every provision for their comfort had\r\nbeen made, and the occasion rapidly became one of delightful enjoyment\r\nunder the stimulation of the grand and historic scenery of the noble\r\nriver, and the glow of friendly courtesy wherever the Irish race\r\nforegathers. The pace could not be very fast, for the greatest of the\r\nsteamers was bound by the speed of the slowest, and these latter were\r\nthe Half-Moon and the Clermont. All the more could the time of\r\nobservation of the many points of interest along the river be extended.\r\nDobb’s Ferry, where Washington had headquarters for so long, while his\r\nlittle army watched the English forces then holding New York against the\r\npatriots. Sleepy Hollow, Washington Irving’s home and the scene of his\r\nromance of The Headless Horseman, were pointed out. Tarrytown, where\r\nMajor André, the British spy, was arrested, and Tappan, where he was\r\nexecuted, were noted as the line of steamers ploughed through the Tappan\r\nZee where the Hudson broadens almost to a lake, and is four miles wide\r\nand twelve miles long, then past the great prison of Sing Sing on the\r\nEast bank. Presently, the line was passing Stony Point, the promontory\r\nof the Hudson near the entrance to the Highlands. And the gallant story\r\nwas retold of how the Revolutionary soldiers posted in the rude fortress\r\nthere had succumbed to an attack by the British; how the loss of the\r\nfort rankled in the patriots’ breasts, and how, at the dead of night, in\r\nmid-July of 1779, mad Anthony Wayne with a devoted band delivered so\r\nsudden and overwhelming an assault that the British garrison was slain\r\nor captured, and the stars and stripes were sent aloft never since to\r\ngive way to an alien flag. On then through the Highlands of the Hudson\r\nwhere the mountains slope down to the river on either side. Old river\r\nmen aboard pointed out Fishkill Mountain, Storm King, Crow’s Nest,\r\nDonderberg, Anthony’s Nose, names written in the history of the country\r\nand the literature of the river. At West Point was seen perched on the\r\ncliffs the quarters of the military academy of the United States, whence\r\nso many great soldiers had been graduated and rich in the memory of\r\nIreland’s celebrated sons as well. Across the river was pointed out the\r\nroad, still winding down to the stream, by which the traitor, Benedict\r\nArnold, fled, taking boat to the English brig of war, when he surely\r\nknew that his treason had been discovered in the capture of Major André.\r\nSwinging carefully then around the West Point bend in the river, that\r\nscene of rare beauty—the straight stretch of ten miles up to Newburg\r\nbay—broke upon the view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM TEMPLE EMMET, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  Member of the Society, and President of the Society of the Friendly\r\n    Sons\r\n  of St. Patrick in the City of New York.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n           MEETING OF THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nUnder the inspiration of these stirring memories, the stimulus of the\r\ncelebration and the desire of all concerned, a brief but memorable\r\nmeeting of the American-Irish Historical Society was held on the forward\r\ncovered deck of the “Asbury Park.” The Vice President of the New York\r\nChapter discussed the events of the day and the week, and the Irish\r\nshare therein, extending welcome to the members who had come from other\r\nstates at the Chapter’s call to meet their brethren in this festal trip,\r\nand called on President-General, Dr. Francis J. Quinlan, to address the\r\ncompany. The members warmed to the President’s appeal, for he has the\r\nhappy gifts of enthusiasm and Celtic eloquence. He spoke for the spread\r\nof the society and its usefulness in gathering for future generations\r\nthe story of the Irish race in America, and laying a foundation for a\r\ngreater communion among its men and women of today. He was followed by\r\nThomas Zanslaur Lee, Secretary General of the Society, who succinctly\r\ntold of the recent remarkable gains in membership, and gave practical\r\nhints for a still greater accession to the Society’s ranks. William\r\nTemple Emmet, President of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, made a\r\nshort speech of sympathy with the aims of the Society, and the\r\nproceedings terminated in an interchange of salutations shared by all\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn Newburg bay the steamers of the fleet were gathering now, hovering\r\nand slowly circling about the Half-Moon and the Clermont and their\r\nescorts. The ancient town rising on the west bank of the river showed a\r\ngala front of flags, while thousands crowded the heights to view the\r\nscene upon the bay. The steamer Providence, bearing the officials of the\r\nday, had drawn up to the landing, and while they took part in a\r\nprocession and made speeches appropriate to the occasion, those on the\r\nrest of the fleet dined and made merry. Never before, perhaps, had the\r\nwaters thereabout furnished such a scene as that of the flag-decked\r\nfleet going to and fro under the blue sky, framed in the red and gold of\r\nautumn on the hills and breaking with screw and paddle the silver of the\r\nwide and placid stream. Would that Washington, whose fearless eyes had\r\noften gazed in the weary days of the long-drawn war, out over the river\r\nthere, had caught that vision of young and strong America afloat and\r\nrejoicing a century after his passing away! His, however, were the eyes\r\nthat saw across the mountains, and in the darkest day beheld the sun\r\nupon the hills beyond, and it is not for us to say what he did not see.\r\n\r\nFrom Albany far up the Hudson had come the officials to take charge of\r\nthe Half-Moon and the Clermont, and the pleasant task of the fleet from\r\nNew York was done. Down the river, then, the prows were turned, and the\r\nhomeward journey was begun. Many were the visits made and returned on\r\nboard the “Asbury Park” as she headed south. The evening was deepening\r\nas she came by the city now breaking into light, a beautiful spectacle.\r\nSo ended a day long to live in memory. As the excursionists stepped\r\nashore to each one was handed a souvenir copy of Mr. Tuite’s “Robert\r\nFulton and His Achievement,” which is reproduced in the volume farther\r\non.\r\n\r\nBy the indefatigable secretary of the New York Chapter, Alfred J.\r\nTalley, I am furnished with the following list of the members of the\r\nSociety who with their families and friends were on board:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  Albeus T.

It was a brilliant spectacle of lighted floats and\r\ncostumed paraders that passed down the avenues with their strings of\r\nelectric lights on either side. One cannot describe it all except in\r\ngeneral terms. It defies words, as a flight of rockets defies them, but\r\nthe Germans, Austrians and Swiss, who mostly furnished the human side of\r\nthe spectacle, did nobly.\r\n\r\nIt was a week to remember, and, as has been indicated, Ireland’s sons\r\nhad a handsome share in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              “MANHATTAN.”\r\n\r\n       An Ode for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration, September, 1909.\r\n\r\n                        BY JOSEPH I. C. CLARKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Here at thy broad sea gate,\r\n               On the ultimate ocean wave,\r\n       Where millions in hope have entered in,\r\n                       Joyous, elate,\r\n       A home and a hearth to win;\r\n       For the promise you held and the bounty you gave,\r\n               Thou, and none other,\r\n       I call to thee, spirit; I call to thee, Mother,\r\n                               America!_\r\n\r\n         _Spirit of world of the West\r\n         Throned on thy lifted sierras,\r\n         Rivers the path for thy feet,\r\n         Forests of green for thy raiment,\r\n         Wide-falling cascades the film of thy veil,\r\n         Moon-glow and star-flash thy jewels,\r\n         Sunrise the gold of thy hair,\r\n         Sweet was thy lure and compelling._\r\n\r\n         _Europe, pale, jaded, had palled us,\r\n         Asia, o’ergilded, repelled us,\r\n         Africa, desert faced, haunted us,\r\n         Thou, when in freshness of morning, hadst called us,\r\n         And wanted us,\r\n         Held us._\r\n\r\n         _Over the ocean we came then,\r\n         Wondering, hoping, adoring,\r\n         Called thee our mother, kissing thy feet,\r\n         Kindling our love into flame, then\r\n         Old worlds and old loves ignoring,\r\n         Making new bondage sweet.\r\n             Bless us today, O Mother._\r\n\r\n       Hark, how the bells are chiming,\r\n       How wind the horns, how cymbals clash,\r\n       And a chorus, in might volume timing,\r\n       To tramping beat that never lags!\r\n       Heavily booming the cannons flash,\r\n       And the air is thrilled with the snapping flags!\r\n\r\n       Where passed the grim Briton with venturing prow\r\n       In the cycles fled,\r\n       The city that stands like a fortress now,\r\n       Turreted high by the edge of the water,\r\n       America’s eldest, magnificent daughter,\r\n       With garlands is twining her brow,\r\n       For joy that her laughing heart remembers\r\n       Three hundred red and gold Septembers.\r\n\r\n       To catch the glint of her proudest glance,\r\n       To hear the heartening music of her drum,\r\n       To see her banners flutter and advance,\r\n       Glad in the sunrise, let us come,\r\n\r\n       Not as came Hudson thro’ mists of the sea—\r\n       Dipping and rolling his Dutch-built ship—\r\n       Scanning the land fall with hungering eyes\r\n       And close-clenched lip,\r\n       By morning and noon,\r\n       Creeping past headland and sand-billowed dune,\r\n       Wing-weary ghost of a phantom quest,\r\n       Steering athrill but where waters led west.\r\n\r\n       Not as when taking the sweep of the bay,\r\n       Sparkling agleam in the brave Autumn weather,\r\n       Silent of man in the new dawn aquiver,\r\n       Anchored his lone ship lay.\r\n       Not as he sailed where the hills draw together\r\n       Holding his course up the broad-breasted river,\r\n       Only the dream of Beyond in his brain,\r\n       Only the seas of Cathay to attain,\r\n       On till the narrowed stream told him ’twas vain.\r\n       Then back as one baffled, undone,\r\n       Unknowing he’d won by the gate of the sea\r\n       The throne of an empire of peoples to be.\r\n       Peace to his dream that found ghastly close\r\n       Mid the sheeted wraiths of the arctic snows!\r\n\r\n       Not as came Fulton; even he\r\n       Came brooding at the level of the sea,\r\n       Elect among the genius-brood of men,\r\n       Grandson of Ireland, son of the land of Penn,\r\n       Pale-browed, nursing a great work-day dream—\r\n       Harnessing the racers of the deep to steam\r\n       Here first his Clermont turned her paddle blades,\r\n       And so, our flag above his craft unfurled,\r\n       He steamed beneath the Palisades,\r\n       The Father of all steam-fleets of the world.\r\n       Well may Manhattan glory in his fame,\r\n       And on her highest roster carve his name,\r\n         Yet, not as came he, let us come.\r\n\r\n       No: to the skies as on wings\r\n       Let us rise\r\n       And come from the east with the faint red dawn,\r\n       Haven and harbor are carpets of trembling gold,\r\n       And the silver mist to the green hills clings\r\n       Till the mounting sun has the web withdrawn,\r\n       And behold,\r\n       The city lifts up to its height at last,\r\n       With frontage of hull and funnel and mast\r\n       In the day’s full beam,\r\n       And over the sky-topping roofs in the blue,\r\n       Over the flags of many a hue\r\n       Are waving white pennons of steam.\r\n\r\n       We know thee, Manhattan, proud queen,\r\n       And thy wonderful mural crown,\r\n       With Liberty islanded there at thy knee,\r\n       Uplifting her welcome to those who’d be free,\r\n       And beckoning earth’s trodden down.\r\n       We know how the waters divide\r\n       And unite for thy pride,\r\n       And the lofty bridges of steel stretch hands\r\n       To the burg on the height that stands\r\n       For thy wealth’s overflow:\r\n       With the freighters creeping between,\r\n       And the slow, slanted sails slipping to and fro,\r\n       As the giants of ocean steam in and go forth.\r\n       We trace thy slim island reach up to the north,\r\n       Its streets in arrowy distance aloom,\r\n       Its marts, its homes, its far off tomb;\r\n       The pleasure greens dotting thy vesture of white,\r\n       And tower and steeple like spears in the light.\r\n\r\n       Lift thee, Manhattan, no peer to thy strength,\r\n       Energy crystalled in turrets of stone,\r\n       Force chained to form thro’ thy breadth and thy length,\r\n       The builders’ Gibraltar, the fortress of trade,\r\n       Might of the mart into monument fashioned,\r\n       Mammon translated to mountain man-made,\r\n       The clouds ever nigher and nigher;\r\n       And the clang of the anvil, the steam-shriek impassioned\r\n       Seem calling from girder and frontlet of steel\r\n       Upward thrown,\r\n       With the square-chiseled blocks,\r\n       As they build ever higher and higher,\r\n       And then, for firm planting thy heel,\r\n       They delve ever deeper to heart of the rocks.\r\n       Deep in thy vitals the dynamos whirring,\r\n       Are feeding thy nerves that are wires,\r\n       Thy tunnels, thy veins,\r\n       Stretch out as the human tide swerves,\r\n       And thy hidden fires\r\n       With the breath of thy bosom stirring,\r\n       Make life in the dark for thy lightning trains.\r\n\r\n       And out of it all a new beauty arising,\r\n       The beauty of force,\r\n       Winning a triumph beyond thy devising,\r\n       Height-mad and power-glad\r\n       Pinnacled, domed, crenelated,\r\n       Masonry clambering course upon course,\r\n       To a glory of skyline serrated,\r\n       Lofty and meet\r\n       For the worship of all the waves laving thy feet.\r\n\r\n       Mighty, ay mighty Manhattan,\r\n       Grown, while Time counted but three arrow flights,\r\n       From bare strand and woodland and slow rising knoll—\r\n       A handful of redmen encamped on thy heights—\r\n       To the city of millions;\r\n       Of millions too ever the goal,\r\n       City whose riches are billions,\r\n       Whose might never fails,\r\n       Whom the nations from far off salute,\r\n       And the voice of a continent hails\r\n       On thy festival day!\r\n\r\n       While the cries of the multitude roll\r\n       In praise of thy marble-hewn body majestic,\r\n       Sing to me, queen, of thy soul.\r\n\r\n       Sing of thy spirit, thy mind,\r\n       Remembering then,\r\n       The kernel and not the rind,\r\n       The heat not the fires.\r\n       We shall not judge thee by thy tallest spires,\r\n       But by the stature of thy men;\r\n       Not thy great wealth of bales and casks and gold,\r\n       Nor mounting scales of what thou’st bought or sold\r\n       Shall here suffice,\r\n       But riches thine in virtues beyond price:\r\n\r\n       Not all thy beauteous daughters costly gowned,\r\n       But of thy women chastely wived and crowned;\r\n       Not all thy gold in public service spent,\r\n       But test of equal, honest government;\r\n       Not creeds or churches, tabernacles, shrines,\r\n       But faith that lives and love that shines;\r\n       Not courts and Judges multiplied,\r\n       But justice throned and glorified;\r\n       Thy reasons clear before the world avowed,\r\n       Not voice of easy conscience of the crowd;\r\n       Not by thy thousand colleges and schools,\r\n       But culture greater than their sums and rules;\r\n       Not by thy topmost reach of speech and song,\r\n       But by their lift of light and art that’s long,\r\n       And from the mingling races in thy blood,\r\n       The wane of evil and the growth of good;\r\n       Not the high-seated but the undertrod;\r\n       The brother love of man for man,\r\n       Ideals not ambitions in the van;\r\n       Not thy lip-worship but the imminence of God.\r\n\r\n       But we who’d mete thy steps upon the heights,\r\n       And thy soul-message ask\r\n       Know well the battles that thy day’s work brought.\r\n       No Greek Atlantis are thou, Plato’s thought\r\n       Made sudden real;\r\n       No fair Utopia thou of mounts ideal,\r\n       Eased of thy burden and thy task\r\n       With long surmountings in the darkness fraught.\r\n\r\n       Swift thy foundations grew, but nights of tears\r\n       And days of dark foreboding marked thy years.\r\n       Here freedom battled with the tyrant’s might,\r\n       Here Washington—Immortal One—made fight.\r\n       Here swung the prison ships and here the jail\r\n       Whose gallows freed the soul of Nathan Hale.\r\n\r\n               The orange flag of Holland flew\r\n                 Above thee for a space.\r\n               Then England’s red for decades few\r\n                 Flushed crimson in thy face,\r\n               Until our arms set over thee\r\n                 The flag none may displace;\r\n               That waving free shall cover thee\r\n                 While lasts the human race—\r\n               The flag that to the breeze we threw\r\n                 When skies of hope were bare,\r\n               Its red our blood, the sky its blue,\r\n                 Its stars our watchlights there.\r\n\r\n       Full oft the ocean harvests at thy doors\r\n       Shed sodden grain upon thy threshing floors,\r\n       The sound, sweet ears with wild tares reached thee mixed,\r\n       Long-fixed beliefs came hitherward unfixed.\r\n       Long-crushed desires that freedom bids to bloom,\r\n       The yoke thrown off, for lawlessness made room.\r\n       How could it other? Shorn of lords and guides\r\n       They pressed atow’rd thee over westering tides.\r\n       From lands of Czars and Princes still they come,\r\n       Some young and lusty, open-browed, and some\r\n       Oppression-stunted, famine-driven, sad.\r\n       All praying thee for welcome fair and glad—\r\n       A niche, a shelter, honest toil and home,\r\n       And these thou givest, Queen beside the foam.\r\n\r\n       And stout their grateful millions stand on guard,\r\n       Their brain and muscle working thee reward—\r\n       The solid Dutch, the level English strain,\r\n       The gifted French, our allies tried and true,\r\n       The German staunch, the Kelt of Ireland bold,\r\n       Italian fire and Spanish pride; the Jew\r\n       Keen-witted, dragging here no ghetto chain;\r\n       Each giving thee their lore, their art of old;\r\n       Each fired by thee with hopes and raptures new.\r\n\r\n       And Queen, thy women exquisite,\r\n       Thy clear-eyed maids, thy mothers pure—\r\n       Pledge of thy greatness sweetly to endure!\r\n       By these I bless thee in thy day of joy,\r\n       Thy wide-thrown halls, thy hospitable board,\r\n       Thy heart of anxious service, and the rays\r\n       Of kindliness within thy bosom stored.\r\n       No evil shall thy graciousness destroy,\r\n       And so I bid thee with increasing days\r\n       No whit thy fair ambitions to abate;\r\n       Fulfill thy destiny of good and great.\r\n\r\n               Hark, the message of Manhattan’s soul!\r\n\r\n       _Constant my soul on the hard path of duty,\r\n         Striving to win to the levels above,\r\n       Longing my soul in the gardens of beauty,\r\n         Eager my soul in the service of love,\r\n       Tender my soul to the angels of pity,\r\n         Humble my soul to the bearers of light,\r\n       Fearless my soul at the gates of the city,\r\n         Stalwart my soul for the ultimate right._\r\n\r\n       _Mighty my dreams of a city imperial,\r\n         Radiant, free with an ordered law,\r\n       Rich, but with mind-gold beyond the material,\r\n         Powerful, merciful, just without flaw,\r\n       Thrift-strong and gentle-voiced, rippling with laughter,\r\n         Song-filled, and thrilled with the triumphs of art,\r\n       Poverty banished, and now and hereafter,\r\n         Peace in my bosom, joy in my heart._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           IRISH STARS IN THE ARCHIVES OF NEW YORK PROVINCE.\r\n\r\n       BY HON. HUGH HASTINGS, FORMER STATE HISTORIAN OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish have never been known as explorers or as discoverers. Their\r\nforte is recognized as establishing success where others have tried and\r\nfailed. Stranded as they were on their desert habitat, we can easily\r\nunderstand why the early annals of our country are not more frequently\r\nembellished by Irish names. As early as October 12, 1605, Sir Arthur\r\nChichester wrote from Ireland to the English prime minister, Robert\r\nCecil, Earl of Salisbury, that it “was absurd folly to run over the\r\nworld in search of colonies in Virginia or Guiana, whilst Ireland was\r\nlying desolate.” The first expedition that left England—almost three\r\nyears before Henry Hudson discovered the river that bears his\r\nname—brought over the first Irishman to America, Francis Maguire, who\r\narrived at Jamestown Virginia, with Captain Christopher Newport, May 6,\r\nnew style, 1607. Maguire remained in the new country for nearly a year\r\nand returned to England with Newport. He wrote an account of his voyage\r\nto Virginia and submitted it to the Privy Council of Spain.\r\n\r\nMany years elapse before an Irish name is discovered among the early\r\nsettlers of New York, and then it is so overwhelmed and encumbered with\r\nDutch orthography and Dutch pronunciation as to be well nigh\r\nindistinguishable, even to its owner if he ever ran over it. Against an\r\nancient Dutch muster roll profound knowledge must bow deferentially. The\r\nmost expert linguist stands in awe of it, and his most skilful\r\nexpedients are often baffled in efforts to translate it, for the\r\nSeventeenth Century Dutch scrivener knew, read, saw, felt, thought,\r\nrecognized nothing but Dutch—nor were mustees, Indians and negroes\r\nexempt from this classification. All were clothed in Dutch\r\northographical habiliments as religiously as they were fed with suppawn\r\nat breakfast, whether it was welcome or not.\r\n\r\nWhen the time arrived, however, for Irish names to appear officially in\r\nthe Archives of the Province of New York, it is supremely gratifying to\r\nus, who are proud of our Irish blood and the State and country in which\r\nwe live, to discover two bright particular stars blazing steadily from a\r\nfirmament black with corruption.\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Dongan, a gallant soldier and experienced man of affairs,\r\narrived in New York City, in the fiftieth year of his age, as governor\r\nof the province, liberty of action was restrained as arbitrarily as\r\nliberty of speech was repressed. The printing press was embargoed.\r\nFreedom of worship was circumscribed. Quakers and Jews were ostracized\r\nand driven from the pale. Dongan was charged by his royal master with\r\nthree important duties:\r\n\r\n  1. To call an assembly of representatives of New York.\r\n\r\n  2. To allure the Indians from the French.\r\n\r\n  3. To introduce the Roman Catholic religion into the Province.\r\n\r\nThe first was easy of accomplishment, for the governor was simply\r\nrequired to carry out the King’s orders, which were most agreeable to\r\nthe persons directly affected. The second was facilitated by the\r\ngovernor’s recognized status as a Catholic. The third was impossible,\r\nbecause of the anomalous position of the King and the avowed and\r\ndeep-rooted hostility of the people to the church of Rome. Furthermore,\r\nin the prosecution of his work toward the fulfillment of these\r\nobligations the governor invariably was balked by the prurient meddling\r\nof his royal master.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly met at Fort James in the Battery, New York, in\r\nOctober, 1683, held a three weeks’ session and passed fourteen measures,\r\nincluding the famous “Charter of Liberties and Privileges.” In this act\r\noccurred the first official mention of “the people” in a constitutional\r\ndocument in America, or, as it reads, the supreme authority under the\r\nKing and the duke “shall forever reside in a governor, council and the\r\npeople met in general assembly.” It was also provided that the\r\nrepresentatives should appoint their times of meeting and that they\r\ncould adjourn from interval to interval at their will; that no tax\r\nshould be imposed but by the consent of the governor, the council of\r\ntwenty-one and the representatives; and that no billeting of troops in\r\ntime of peace should be tolerated. Full and free liberty was granted to\r\nall persons professing faith in God by Jesus Christ, unmolested to\r\nexercise the mode of worship agreeable to them, provided “the good\r\npeople be not disturbed.” To Albany and New York were given charters.\r\n\r\nIn this connection before proceeding to the consideration of the broader\r\nlines of Dongan’s policy and of the matters he accomplished or failed to\r\naccomplish, it may not be amiss to glance at some of the restrictions\r\nplaced upon and some of the liberties enjoyed by the New Yorker of that\r\nperiod. The population of the province was estimated at 20,000 souls.\r\nNone but freemen were permitted to sell by retail or exercise any\r\nhandicraft trade; a tax of £3, 12s. was laid upon every merchant and\r\nshopkeeper and of £1, 4s. upon every handicraft man when set free; only\r\nfreemen or a resident of the city three years were permitted to trade\r\nupon Hudson river; all the inhabitants on the Hudson river were\r\nprohibited from trading across the sea; bakers were required to keep\r\ngood household bread made of flour, as “the meals come from the mill”;\r\nno flour bolted or “bisket” should be made for exportation but in the\r\ncity; no flour or bread should be imported into the city from any other\r\npart of the province; the assize for bread was established every three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nA few ancient police regulations of Dongan’s time will forcibly appeal\r\nto the modern dweller in New York. Servile work on the Lord’s day was\r\nproscribed under a penalty of ten shillings, with double the fine for\r\neach repetition. Children were forbidden from gathering in the streets\r\nor places to play on that day. Public houses were prohibited from\r\nselling liquor on the Sabbath during divine service unless to\r\ntravellers. Constables were compelled to walk the streets with their\r\nstaffs to see that the law was fulfilled, and were further required to\r\nreturn the names of all strangers that come to reside within the ward as\r\nmasters of public houses were ordered to report all strangers that come\r\nto lodge or live with them, as the custom is today in every European\r\ncity. In the days of Dongan twenty carmen and no more were appointed\r\nunder proper regulations—one of which demanded that they fill up, amend\r\nand repair the breaches in the streets and highways, in and about the\r\ncity, when required by the Mayor, gratis. No negro or other slave was\r\npermitted to drive any cart, except brewers’ drays, within the city. The\r\ncarrying of concealed weapons was interdicted.\r\n\r\nThe high hopes the colonists had entertained of the liberal and\r\nenlightened policy James had outlined by Dongan’s introduction were soon\r\ndashed to the ground and they suffered all the pangs of a crushing\r\ndisappointment. The Assembly promised by the Charter of Liberties was\r\nnever convened, for in February, 1685, Charles II, King of England,\r\ndied. His brother, the Duke of York, ascended the throne and as James\r\nthe King promptly repudiated the Colonial policy of James the Duke, the\r\ncharter was vetoed, the Assembly was abolished and the province was\r\nprecipitated backward to the old Monarchial order of things.\r\n\r\nDongan in the meantime had won the affection and confidence of the\r\nIroquois, partly by means of his religious professions and by his tact\r\nand straightforwardness in dealing with them. The innocent-hearted child\r\nof the forest trusted Corlear most implicitly in spite of French\r\nintrigue and French subsidies. It was the influence which Dongan had\r\ngained that restrained the tribes from a contemplated foray in Virginia.\r\nWith the Indian situation confidently in his hand, Dongan was checked by\r\nhis King, who had entered into a religious coalition with Louis XIV, the\r\nmost powerful sovereign in Europe. James ordered the governor to prevent\r\nthe Iroquois from attending a council in Canada to entertain proposals\r\nfor peace. The lieutenant on the ground, unbiased by notions of European\r\npolitics, far better understood the situation in New York than his royal\r\nmaster three thousand miles away. The governor was more far-sighted than\r\nhis King. Dongan diligently aspired to annihilate French supremacy over\r\nthe Indians, but questioned the wisdom of using Jesuits, whose\r\npredilections for the French were well known to him. The Iroquois were\r\nloyal to New York and had never forgiven the French for the seizure of\r\ntheir sachems by order of Louis XIV. Dongan faithfully attempted to\r\nfoster the former sentiment, as he never neglected an opportunity to\r\nremind his red allies of the latter prejudice. The efficacious methods\r\nhe had pursued were destroyed by the treaty of neutrality which\r\ninhibited New England and France from assisting Indians who were at war\r\nwith one another.\r\n\r\nDongan’s crowning offense, however, in the eyes of his King was his\r\nfailure to force his faith upon a people who were in no mood, as later\r\nevents proved, to permit their religious prejudices to be tampered with.\r\nAgain were the prudence and the wisdom of the lieutenant demonstrated at\r\nthe expense of the intelligence of the King. Dongan’s loyalty and\r\ndevotion to his church never was doubted nor questioned. The course he\r\npursued reflects the highest credit upon his conservatism, his courage\r\nand his fidelity to religious principle. If any event were needed in the\r\nlife of a King to prove deficiency in judgment, and incompetence as a\r\nruler, the action of the unfortunate James II in superseding Thomas\r\nDongan at this critical time and for the specific cause selected would\r\nprove sufficient and convincing.\r\n\r\nWe all have read and listened to the marvellous tales of that jaunty\r\nterror of the seas, Captain William Kidd, and been brought up from\r\nchildhood on the mournful ballad of William Moore—household names both\r\nof them—but how many remember the importance of the influence exercised\r\nin those days by the governor of New York, Richard Coote, Earl of\r\nBellomont, in the formation of the expedition organized by the former\r\nand in the apprehension of the culprit for the murder of the latter. The\r\ntimes were scandalously corrupt and corrupt individuals lived\r\nextravagantly up to the times. Land-grabbing was practised as an art in\r\nNew York then as it is practised in Oregon today. Indian rings and land\r\ngrants were common and notorious and flourished brazenly. Officers of\r\nthe Crown who should have crushed them were often ringleaders in\r\norganizing them; ministers of the gospel, who should have interceded for\r\nand protected the innocent child of the forest, basely betrayed their\r\ntrust, and were leagued in corruption to acquire vast tracts of valuable\r\nland from the confiding aboriginal owner. The governor of the province\r\nseldom arose above his environment. As a rule he possessed no\r\ncapabilities for the position. If he were not bankrupt he was ignorant,\r\nor a degenerate representative of the nobility, despatched to New York\r\nto repair or redeem his shattered fortune or to make one by whatever\r\nmeans he might employ, the province being regarded by the home\r\nauthorities as a common receptacle to be utilized for the purposes\r\nnamed. Sympathy for the colonists on the part of a governor was\r\ndisplayed as seldom as integrity or interest in the future of the\r\nprovince. The ambition of the governor seemed to be bounded by\r\nperquisites and he generally left the shores of New York for England\r\nwith a fortune that placed him on a plane with the richest men of the\r\nold world. Privateering was a prolific source of revenue. No man with\r\nready cash disdained identity with it. It was countenanced by so\r\ngracious a ruler as William III, who encouraged and patronized it. A\r\nchange of flag only was necessary to convert an innocent privateer into\r\na ferocious and bloodthirsty pirate. These wild rovers of the sea\r\nrespected neither vessel nor nation. Many bore commissions from James II\r\nand from William III and many bore none at all. Governor Fletcher was\r\ntheir acknowledged friend and alleged co-partner in their villainies.\r\nNew York City was their recognized headquarters.\r\n\r\nIt was because Bellomont had established a reputation as a man of\r\nresolution and of integrity that he was chosen by his King as governor\r\nof New York. His orders imposed obligations that reflected credit upon\r\nhis abilities as an executive of the purest virtue and the strongest\r\ncharacter. Discontent and disorder were rampant because of the cruel\r\nmurder of Leisler and Milborne. Uneasiness and anxiety prevailed\r\nthroughout the province because of the threatened attitude of the\r\nIndians. The rapacity and greed of his predecessor, Fletcher, had\r\nengendered enmities and jealousies that even the mighty resources of the\r\nKing were powerless to allay.\r\n\r\nBellomont’s requisition for a frigate to suppress piracy was vetoed, for\r\nthe reason that England needed her entire available marine force for\r\nservice in home waters because of the war with France. The suggestion of\r\na private ship was more successful and met with the financial assistance\r\nof the King, the duke of Shrewsbury, lord chancellor Somers, the Earls\r\nof Oxford and Romney, Robert Livingston and others, Bellomont assuming\r\nthe responsibility of equipment. It was this ship, the _Adventure_,\r\nwhich was turned over to William Kidd, a resident of New York, then in\r\nLondon. Kidd, beyond question, ranks as the transcendent specimen of his\r\nclass. He was a navigator _par excellence_, a man of the world; a type\r\nthat, when pushed by fortune into any orbit, commands the situation by\r\nthe power of his own robust characteristics. Kidd’s orders were simple.\r\nHe was to prey upon French commerce and to destroy pirates. In the first\r\ndesideratum he proved a failure; in the second, by becoming a pirate\r\nhimself he achieved a brilliant and, in the end, a fatal success. Upon\r\nhis career on the high seas, as a privateer and pirate, it is not\r\nnecessary to dilate. Two years after his departure from Plymouth he\r\narrived in New York, only to find that his friend, Governor Fletcher,\r\nand other piratical sympathizers were no longer in control of the\r\naffairs of the province. Kidd sailed Eastward along the Sound and buried\r\npart of his plunder on Gardiner’s Island. He then proceeded to Boston,\r\nwhere he appeared on the streets in the gorgeous raiment of a man of\r\nfashion. Governor Bellomont happened to meet him, recognized him,\r\narrested him and shipped him to Europe. Kidd was tried and convicted for\r\nthe murder of William Moore—and was hanged as a pirate.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Bellomont deplored the legacy his predecessor, Fletcher,\r\nhad left him: A divided people, an empty purse, a few miserable, naked,\r\nhalf-starved soldiers, not half the number the King allowed pay for; the\r\nfortifications and the governor’s house very much out of repair, and “in\r\na word the whole government was out of frame.” The province was rent\r\nwith turmoil and turbulence in consequence of the Leisler-Milborne\r\nrebellion. The new governor’s sympathies had been drawn toward the\r\nmartyr Leisler, whose enemies in the aristocratic party resisted almost\r\nto the point of violence Bellomont’s efforts to make restitution for a\r\nmonstrous crime. As a rebuke to the rascality of his predecessor\r\nBellomont had declared: “I will take care there shall be no\r\nmisapplication of the public money; I will pocket none of it myself nor\r\nshall there be embezzlement by others.” To this standard he\r\nunflinchingly held. No breath of scandal, no charge of prostitution of\r\nduty for self-aggrandizement tainted his reputation. He loyally\r\nprotected the interests of those whom he was sent to govern. He was\r\ndistinctively a statesman of the constructive school, in marked\r\ncontradistinction to many of those governors who preceded and who\r\nfollowed him, who pursued a policy of confiscation or of destruction—of\r\nconfiscation in grabbing everything in sight and of destruction by\r\nundermining the liberties of the people and by attempted restriction of\r\ntheir God-given rights. Under Bellomont’s short administration the\r\nfrontiers were strengthened, a library was established, printing was\r\nencouraged, shipping promoted and education, which had been neglected,\r\nstimulated. His untimely death, however, prevented the development of\r\nmany beneficent reforms which he had under contemplation.\r\n\r\nUnder the cloak of politics repressive religious measures were adopted\r\nand inhuman persecutions practised. Dongan, an Irish Catholic, favored\r\nan act permitting Jews to exercise their religion, but the New York\r\nCommon Council vetoed the proposition, while Bellomont, an Irish church\r\nof England worshipper, approved the measure proscribing priests, on the\r\nground that Catholic prelates uniformly labored to excite the Indians\r\nagainst the Anglo-Americans. Both governors recommend themselves to\r\nposterity for enlightened statesmanship that throws into deep obscurity\r\nthe times in which they lived. Dongan brought to the province of New\r\nYork the first semblance of a representative form of government; under\r\nLord Bellomont the first spark of American Independence flashes, by the\r\ndemand that the colonists repudiate the laws of England because the\r\ncolonists are not represented in the parliament that frames these laws.\r\nThe board of trade of London directs Bellomont to check this heresy\r\nbecause “the independence the Colonists thirst for is so notorious.”\r\n\r\nDuring the Colonial epoch England assigned many men to govern New York.\r\nThe governor possessed unlimited despotic powers. He exercised authority\r\ndenied to the King. He not only made the laws but interpreted and\r\nexecuted them, and when necessary unmade them. He usurped the\r\nprerogatives of the Assembly and of the courts; his council was merely\r\nan aggregation of automatons who danced when he pulled the string. No\r\nact of the Assembly was placed on the statute book without his signature\r\nand no decision of the court was valid until he, as chief justice,\r\npassed judgment, and in this respect he exercised powers denied to the\r\nKing, for his Majesty, while permitted to sit on the king’s bench, was\r\nprohibited from expressing judgment. There were two governors of early\r\nNew York who never have been brought under the ban of usurping the\r\nfunctions of the coördinate branches of government nor of debasing the\r\npowers confided to them by their superiors, Thomas Dongan and the Earl\r\nof Bellomont. No charge ever has been brought that they carried away\r\nmoney unworthily raised or dishonestly made. Nor has either ever been\r\naccused of using his high position for unmeritorious or discreditable\r\npurposes. Both, however, have received the encomiums and praise of\r\nhistorians of England and America as rulers and statesmen of the highest\r\ndegree of efficiency and honesty at a time when the standard of morals\r\nand of statesmanship was lamentably low and unquestionably debased.\r\nToward both every Irishman and every New Yorker should turn with\r\nsentiments of the strongest esteem and admiration of the highest\r\ncalibre, not only in commendation of the success they gained in the\r\nfulfillment of official obligations in the face of discouraging and\r\ncorrupt environment, but for the sturdy and sterling manhood they\r\ndisplayed in the maintenance of their official honor and in the normal\r\nperformance of their official duty.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may not be amiss for us to pay a deserved tribute\r\nto Dr. Edmund Bailey O’Callaghan, a native of Ireland, who was more\r\ninstrumental in awakening the study of the Dutch language and of our\r\npriceless Dutch records than any other man since the creation of the\r\nState of New York. Dr. O’Callaghan represented the type of the pushing,\r\naggressive and scholarly Irishman. Two years of his early life were\r\ndevoted to the study of medicine in Paris. At the age of twenty-six he\r\ncrossed the ocean, settled in Canada and at once became prominent in the\r\nagitation for Catholic emancipation in Ireland and England. He became\r\nsecretary of an organization for Irish immigrants to America, edited a\r\nnewspaper in Montreal, and was sent to the Provincial Parliament, where\r\nhis activity and ability placed him in the front rank as a leader. His\r\nradical views and conduct, however, brought a mob of tories to his\r\noffice and led to the destruction of his type, press and establishment.\r\nHis neighbors, however, made it so unpleasant that he was compelled to\r\nseek refuge in the United States when he was forty years of age. He\r\nestablished his residence in Albany, was fortunate in the selection of\r\nhis most intimate friend, Chancellor Reuben Hyde Walworth, practised his\r\nprofession with more or less success, and at the same time conducted an\r\nindustrial paper called the _Northern Light_. It was at this period\r\nthat, during the anti-rent disturbances, he undertook the study of the\r\nDutch language. His “History of New Netherlands” made him famous and\r\nstimulated the study of Colonial records and Colonial research\r\nthroughout the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HONORABLE JAMES FITZGERALD.\r\n\r\n  Justice of Supreme Court of the State of New York.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE SIXTY-NINTH REGIMENT, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\n_A Paper Read before the American-Irish Historical Society, at its\r\nTwelfth Annual Meeting, Held at the Hotel Plaza, New York City,\r\nSaturday, January 8, 1910, by Hon. James Fitzgerald, Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of the State of New York._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe patriotic founders of our government looked with disfavor upon the\r\nexistence of large standing armies in times of peace for very many\r\nreasons. Not only did they consider them a tax upon industry and a drain\r\nupon the young manhood of the country, but they felt that their\r\nmaintenance constituted a menace to liberty, and yet these wise and far\r\nseeing builders of the Republic realized that there could be no security\r\nfor personal liberty or property rights in a State that had not at its\r\ncommand an armed force, and so we find imbedded in the fundamental law a\r\nprovision that “a well regulated militia being necessary to the security\r\nof a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not\r\nbe infringed” (Art. 2, 1st Amendts. U. S. Const. March, 1789). Freedom\r\nhad just been achieved by the sword, and that reliance for its\r\npreservation must at all times rest upon arms was a doctrine to which\r\nthe statesmen of the Revolution unreservedly subscribed. Soldiers were\r\nnecessary but it was not necessary that all good soldiers should be\r\nprofessionals. To citizens engaged in the ordinary avocations of life,\r\nin industrial arts, in commercial pursuits, in commerce or trade, in the\r\nprofessions, military instruction could be given, opportunities for\r\npractice and drill formations afforded, including lessons in the\r\norganization and mobilization of armies, so that when necessity\r\nrequired, a well disciplined armed body might be readily summoned from\r\ncivil ranks for service in the field and as readily absorbed back into\r\nindustrial life when the hour of peril had passed, the threatened danger\r\nhad been averted and the emergency no longer existed for martial music,\r\nemblazoned banners, marching legions and tented fields.\r\n\r\nSince the earliest settlement of this continent, the Irish race has been\r\nprominently identified with our history. Irishmen were among the first\r\nsettlers; they continued to come uninterruptedly, they are still coming,\r\nand unless conditions change very much for the better in the Green Isle,\r\nthey are going to keep on coming in the future. The spirit of\r\nIrish-Americanism is a spirit of intense Americanism; it stands for the\r\nUnion of States, the sovereignty of the flag, obedience to the laws,\r\nloyalty to the government, good citizenship in peace, and in war, prompt\r\nresponse when volunteers are called for. Volumes would be insufficient\r\nto spread the record of the achievements of the sons of Erin upon\r\nAmerican battlefields; individuals might be cited by the score or by the\r\nhundred whose intrepidity and devotion shed glory upon our arms on sea\r\nand shore.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the State of New York, adopted April 20, 1777,\r\ncontained the clause: “The militia of this State at all times hereafter,\r\nas well in peace as in war, shall be armed, disciplined and ready for\r\nservice.” The necessary enactments to carry out this provision were\r\nprovided for by legislation the following year. (Chap. 33. “An Act for\r\nregulating the Militia of the State of New York.” Passed April 3, 1778;\r\nChap. 46, An Act to amend an act entitled “An Act for regulating the\r\nMilitia of the State of New York.” Passed June 30, 1778.) Outside of a\r\nfew cities, while the militia force was large upon paper, it was in\r\nreality but a mere skeleton. Until at the end of 1860, there were less\r\nthan 15,000 men uniformed, disciplined and drilled, or in any sort of\r\nreadiness for military duty, and this meagre force was chiefly confined\r\nto the cities of New York and Brooklyn, with contingents at Kingston and\r\nAlbany.\r\n\r\nThe first record of the 69th Regiment of New York City is the order\r\nissued by the Adjutant General, bearing date November 1, 1851, and\r\ndesignated “General Order 489.” This order provided for the\r\nconsolidation into a single regiment of a number of independent\r\ncompanies which had been separately organized prior to that time chiefly\r\nby men of Irish birth or parentage. About this period, owing to the vast\r\nvolume of immigration in the preceding decade, New York contained the\r\nlargest Irish population of any city in the world, and from the first,\r\nthe 69th became identified in the public mind as a regiment composed of\r\nIrishmen. Among its early officers appear the names of some men who were\r\nwell-known in connection with the Young Ireland movement, which had\r\nculminated but a few years previously. Its first commander was Colonel\r\nCharles S. Roe, who served until 1854, and was succeeded by Colonel\r\nJames B. Ryan, who was followed August 26, 1859, by the gallant and\r\nbeloved Col. Michael Corcoran. The regiment crept early into the\r\naffections of the people of the metropolis and was beloved by the Irish\r\nresidents. Its distinctive character was manifested in numerous and\r\nemphatic ways,—sometimes by the wearing of green faced tunics, at others\r\nby the display of plumes showing the green above the red, the carrying\r\nof the Irish flag, or other similar devices. It had usually the right of\r\nthe line in the St. Patrick’s Day parades, and in all functions in which\r\nit participated, its approach was heralded by the strains of well-known\r\nIrish music. It rapidly became the typical Irish military organization\r\nof the country, and for its success or failure, the children of the race\r\nthroughout the Union felt themselves responsible.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, the then Prince of Wales—now Edward VII, King of Great\r\nBritain—visited the United States, and was scheduled to arrive in New\r\nYork City on Thursday, October 11, of that year. The First Division, New\r\nYork State Militia, was ordered out to receive him and directed to form\r\nat the Battery for the purpose of parade and review. All the regiments\r\nof the Division with the exception of the Sixty-ninth Regiment,\r\nassembled at the time and place appointed for the formation. The order\r\nreceived by Colonel Corcoran from headquarters was not promulgated, and\r\nhe was immediately ordered under arrest and a court martial summoned to\r\ntry him upon a charge of disobedience of orders. This circumstance fixed\r\nfirmly in the public mind the race and sentiments of the commander and\r\nthe men of the 69th.\r\n\r\nApril 12, 1861, witnessed the firing upon Fort Sumter, and on the 15th,\r\nPresident Lincoln issued his proclamation calling out the militia of the\r\nseveral states to the number of 75,000 men, and five days thereafter,\r\nthe court martial which had been ordered to try Colonel Corcoran was\r\ndissolved, the pending charges were dismissed, and he was at once\r\nrestored to his command. The order dismissing the charges, which bears\r\ndate, April 20, 1861, is designated Special Order No. 9, and reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “In pursuance of Special Orders No. 58 from General Headquarters, the\r\n  Court Martial detailed for the trial of Colonel Corcoran is dissolved,\r\n  and the charges dismissed, and Colonel Corcoran is directed forthwith\r\n  to resume the command of his regiment.\r\n\r\n                    “By order of\r\n                            “CHARLES W. SANFORD,\r\n                                                      “_Major-General_.\r\n\r\n                            “GEORGE W. MORELL,\r\n                                        “_Div. Eng’r. and Div. Insp’r._”\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Corcoran at once resumed command of the regiment and issued\r\nGeneral Order No. 1, an historic order concluding with the words: “The\r\nCommandant feels proud that his first duty after being relieved from a\r\nlong arrest is to have the honor of promulgating an order to the\r\nregiment to rally to the support of the Constitution and Laws of the\r\nUnited States.” Within twenty-four hours from the posting of this order,\r\nsix thousand men had volunteered, but the instructions of Governor\r\nMorgan prohibited the enlistment of more than the regimental compliment\r\nof one thousand men. The twenty-third of April, 1861, dawned bright and\r\nclear, but warmer than usual at that season, over the Empire City;\r\napprehension and gloom prevailed throughout the country; ten sovereign\r\nstates had formed a powerful confederacy and were in armed revolt\r\nagainst the authority of the Federal Government. Many of the ablest\r\nsoldiers and statesmen of the Republic had taken their stand against the\r\nUnion; the timid were upon the verge of panic, and misgivings and\r\nuncertainty were paralyzing even the resolute and strong. Under such\r\ncircumstances, faithful and loyal, the gallant Sixty-ninth Militia\r\nassembled in Prince Street, near the then St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the\r\nCathedral of the great Archbishop of New York, the Most Reverend John\r\nHughes, and proceeded thence to the rendezvous at Great Jones Street.\r\nHope was given to the hearts of the good people of this city as they\r\nwitnessed the spirit displayed by this brave body of citizen soldiery,\r\nand when at the appointed hour, the order to march was sounded and the\r\nregiment proceeded down Broadway to the strains of martial music, the\r\nsurging multitude that lined the streets, the myriad spectators that\r\nfilled the windows along the route to Cortlandt Street broke into\r\ncontinuous cheers. Twin flags floated everywhere on that day. Twin\r\nbanners were carried by the regimental standard bearers—the flag of\r\nColumbia with all its stars emblazoned on its field of blue, the green\r\nbanner of Erin with the harp uncrowned. The regiment boarded the Steamer\r\n“James Adger,” at Pier 4, North River, reached Annapolis on the\r\ntwenty-sixth of April, and proceeding up the Potomac to Washington by\r\nSteamer “Marion,” was mustered into the service of the United States on\r\nMay 9 for three months. The following is a list of the field, staff and\r\ncompany commanders at this time:\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FIELD AND STAFF.\r\n\r\n  Colonel—Michael Corcoran, Commanding.\r\n  Lieutenant Colonel—Robert B. Nugent.\r\n  Major—James Bagley.\r\n  Adjutant—John McKeon.\r\n  Chaplain—Rev. Thomas Mooney.\r\n  Engineers—Hon. John H. McCunn, James B. Kirker.\r\n  Surgeon—Dr. James L. Kiernan.\r\n  Assistant Surgeon—Robert Johnson.\r\n  Quartermaster—Joseph B. Tully.\r\n  Paymaster—Martin Kehoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          COMPANY COMMANDERS.\r\n\r\n  Company “A”—Captain Haggerty.\r\n  Company “B”—Captain Lynch.\r\n  Company “C”—Captain Cavanagh.\r\n  Company “D”—Captain Clark.\r\n  Company “E”—Captain Kelly.\r\n  Company “F”—Captain Breslin.\r\n  Company “G”—Captain Duffy.\r\n  Company “H”—Captain James Kelly.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of May a body of three hundred men, known as Meagher’s\r\nZouaves, recruited after the regiment’s departure, joined Colonel\r\nCorcoran at the Capitol City. At midnight on the 23d of May the 69th,\r\ntogether with the 5th Massachusetts, the 28th New York, and a detachment\r\nof regular cavalry, crossed the Aqueduct Bridge at Georgetown into\r\nVirginia. On the following morning the regiment began the construction\r\nof Fort Corcoran, which, with Fort Runyon, constituted the first regular\r\nworks erected by Federalist forces at the beginning of the Civil War,\r\nand the ceremonies attending the raising of the flag on the occasion\r\nwere participated in by Colonel Corcoran, Colonel David Hunter and\r\nCaptain Thomas Francis Meagher, two of whom subsequently attained the\r\nrank of Brigadier General (Corcoran and Meagher) and the third of whom\r\n(Hunter) afterwards became a Major General. The 69th, together with the\r\n79th and 13th New York and 2d Wisconsin regiments, and a Battery of\r\nLight Artillery, U. S. A., composed the 3d Brigade of the 1st Division\r\nof McDowell’s Army, having for its Brigade Commander Colonel William\r\nTecumseh Sherman, of the 13th U. S. Infantry, whose distinguished\r\nachievements in after years elevated him to foremost rank among the\r\ngreat Captains of history. Brigadier General Daniel Tyler commanded the\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nOn July 21st, the regiment participated in the Battle of Bull Run\r\n(Manassas). Col. Corcoran was wounded and fell into the hands of the\r\nConfederates. The regiment lost one hundred and fifty of its members,\r\namong them its gallant Acting Lieutenant Colonel James Haggerty, of whom\r\nthe eloquent Meagher said: “No braver soldier was ever produced by the\r\nland of Sarsfield and Shields.” The three months period of service\r\nhaving expired, the 69th Regiment, New York State Militia, was mustered\r\nout of the United States service August 3, 1861, and returned to New\r\nYork City, resuming its position as a militia regiment of the State. The\r\ntime for which the regiment had been called into service had ended but\r\nthe great war had only fairly begun, and President Lincoln having issued\r\nhis call for 500,000 men for three years or the war, about 800 of the\r\nreturned militiamen volunteered to re-enlist, and on August 30, 1861,\r\nunder orders from the War Department, the 69th Regiment, New York\r\nVolunteers, was formed. Robert Nugent was selected as Colonel; James\r\nKelly, Lieutenant Colonel; and James Cavanagh, Major. This regiment was\r\nrapidly recruited to full strength, and so many additional recruits\r\npresented themselves that it was decided to organize a brigade. The 63d\r\nand 88th Regiments, together with the 14th and 15th Independent\r\nBatteries, New York Light Artillery, in furtherance of this design, were\r\nimmediately formed. The organization of the brigade was entrusted to\r\nThomas Francis Meagher, who, on February 6, 1862, assumed its command as\r\nBrigadier General. This gifted and daring soldier and patriot, the\r\nCommander of the Irish Brigade, will ever be remembered as a conspicuous\r\nfigure of his time. In his early manhood, by gift of genius, he had\r\nleaped to foremost rank among public men in his native isle. He had\r\npleaded the doctrine of armed resistance to tyranny with an inspired\r\neloquence and had defied the might of his country’s oppressors by\r\nparticipating in an insurrection; he had been condemned to death and had\r\nsuffered a long imprisonment. The electric eloquence of the peroration\r\nof a speech delivered by him in Conciliation Hall in Dublin in 1846,\r\nduring the Repeal agitation, caused him to be referred to thereafter as\r\n“Meagher of the sword.” His fidelity to the warlike principles advocated\r\nin his youth on behalf of Ireland was demonstrated by gallant conduct in\r\nmany of the bloodiest battles of the American Civil War, and well\r\nestablished his title to high rank among the soldier sons of a fighting\r\nrace. To tell the story of the Irish Brigade would be to recite the\r\nhistory of the Civil War. It participated rapidly in the Battle of Fair\r\nOaks, May 31st; Gaines Mill, June 28th; Savage Station, June 29th; Peach\r\nOrchard, White Oaks Swamp, Glendale, June 30th; and Malvern Hill, July\r\n1st, marching thereafter to Newport News, and proceeding by transports\r\nand on foot to Falmouth, Alexandria, Arlington Heights, Falls Church,\r\nFairfax Court House and Centreville, crossing the Potomac at Chain\r\nBridge, and marching to Tenallytown, Rockville and Frederick City,\r\nMaryland, crossing South Mountain to Antietam, participating in that\r\nbattle and leaving two hundred and one of its members either killed or\r\nwounded to testify to the character of the resistance offered by these\r\nsons of the Gael to the rebel line in front of the “Bloody Lane.” On\r\nDecember 13th the regiment constituting part of Meagher’s Brigade took\r\npart in the desperate attempt to carry the impregnable position of the\r\nConfederate forces on Marye’s Heights at Fredericksburg. The valor\r\ndisplayed by the officers and men on this memorable day must dwell\r\nforever in the memory of mankind. Inspired by the traditions of the old\r\nbrigades, the brigades of O’Brien, Dillon, Lally, Sarsfield, the\r\nbrigades of Landen, Ramilles and Fontenoy; aroused by the burning\r\neloquence and encouraged by the intrepid daring of their fearless\r\nleader; mindful of the wrongs which exiled them from their native\r\nshores; grateful to the free, fair land that welcomed them to home and\r\nliberty, there was no danger too great for them to face, no suffering\r\ntoo severe to endure, no odds too overwhelming to encounter. Five\r\nhundred and forty-five soldiers of the Irish Brigade fell in that heroic\r\ncharge in that most bloody quarter of a mile ever dashed over by armed\r\nmen in the annals of civilized warfare. The testimony of the _London\r\nTimes_ correspondent will be regarded at least as not coming from an\r\nunduly partial source. This is his description of the charge of the\r\nIrish Brigade: “Never at Fontenoy, Albuera, nor at Waterloo was more\r\nundaunted courage displayed than during those six frantic dashes which\r\nthe Irish Brigade directed against the almost impregnable position of\r\ntheir foe. That mortal man could have carried the position, defended as\r\nit was, seems idle for a moment to believe, but the bodies which lie in\r\ndense masses within forty-eight yards of the muzzles of Colonel Walton’s\r\nguns are the best evidence of what manner of men they were who pressed\r\nonto death, with the dauntlessness of the race which has gained glory on\r\na thousand battlefields and never more richly deserved it than at the\r\nfoot of Marye’s Heights on the 13th day of December, 1862.” In his\r\nofficial report General Meagher says: “Of the 1,200 men I took into\r\naction, only 280 appeared on parade next morning.”\r\n\r\nTo the achievements of Meagher’s Brigade must be added a reference to\r\nthe gallant services of the renowned Corcoran Legion, for, in simple\r\njustice, all of the regiments composing the Brigade and the Legion must\r\nbe regarded as branches of the parent tree, the root of which was the\r\nold 69th Regiment of ’51, which has continuously flourished so far for\r\nnigh a decade more than a full half century. The exchange of Colonel\r\nCorcoran as a prisoner of war was effected through the instrumentality\r\nof President Lincoln, August 15, 1862, more than a year after his having\r\nfallen into Confederate hands, and he was at once commissioned Brigadier\r\nGeneral, with rank and pay dating from the day of his capture over a\r\nyear before. His reception upon his return to the City of New York was\r\nmost enthusiastic, he having endeared himself to its people, not only by\r\nhis brilliant and daring actions in the field, but by his heroic conduct\r\nin refusing liberty upon the condition that he would not again take up\r\narms in his country’s cause. The Legion was at once organized and was\r\ncomposed of the 155th, 164th, 170th and 69th (subsequently changed to\r\nthe 182d to avoid confusion) Regiments, New York Volunteers. General\r\nCorcoran reported with his command to General John A. Dix, at Fortress\r\nMonroe, in November, 1862. The Legion was in active service for nearly\r\nthree years and participated in many of the bloodiest battles of the\r\nwar, among them Suffolk, Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor, Reams Station and\r\nPort Hudson. Upon these and other fields it served and fought, lavish of\r\nblood, reckless of life, mindful only of the honor of the race and the\r\npreservation of our glorious Union of States. After Fredericksburg, the\r\nremnant of the 69th Regiment continued in the service, fought at\r\nChancellorsville May 3d, 1863, and at Gettysburg July 1st, upon whose\r\nhistoric ground a beautiful Celtic Cross has since been erected by the\r\nState of New York as a testimonial of appreciation of the splendid\r\nservices rendered to the Union cause by the Irish Brigade and of the\r\nheroism, sacrifice and patriotism of its members.\r\n\r\nAfter Gettysburg, recrossing the Potomac, the regiment participated in\r\nactions at Auburn Ford, Bristow Station and the Mine Run Campaign. By\r\nthis time it was practically wiped out and returned to New York City\r\nJanuary 2, 1864, where it was recruited nearly up to its original\r\nstrength and returned to the front. On May 4th, crossing the Rapidan, it\r\ntook part in the Battle of Spottsylvania, May 8, where it met with heavy\r\nloss. It was again in action May 27th at Totopotomoy Creek, and at Cold\r\nHarbor on June 3d. It later participated in the siege of Petersburg.\r\nColonel Nugent, who had commanded the regiment through the greater part\r\nof its long campaigning, was again with it at Hatchers Run, Five Forks,\r\nSoutherland Station, South Side Railroad, Amelia Springs, Farmville, and\r\ndown to Appomattox, April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nWhen General Grant determined upon demanding the surrender of the\r\nConfederate forces, the first communication upon this subject was\r\ncarried by Colonel Nugent to an officer of General Lee’s Army. This\r\nfamous order was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         “April 7, 1865.\r\n\r\n  “_General_:\r\n\r\n  “The result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of\r\n  further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in\r\n  this struggle. I feel that it is so, and regard it as my duty to shift\r\n  from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood by\r\n  asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States\r\n  Army known as the Army of Northern Virginia.\r\n\r\n                                         “(Signed) U. S. GRANT,\r\n                                                 “_Lieutenant General_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThus from Bull Run to Appomattox, from the firing upon Sumter to the\r\nfall of Richmond, the 69th Regiment was in continuous service,\r\nparticipating in all the decisive battles of a four years’ war\r\nunsurpassed in magnitude and fierceness. When mustered out of the\r\nservice, after passing in the grand review at the National Capitol, May,\r\n1865, with decimated ranks and shattered banners, it could claim the\r\nproud record of never having disobeyed an order, of never having lost a\r\nflag. In Fox’s Regimental Losses in the Civil War the 69th heads the\r\nroll of regiments recruited in the Empire State in the number of killed\r\nand wounded.\r\n\r\nBy Chap. 477, L. 1862, passed April 23, entitled “An Act to provide for\r\nthe enrollment of the Militia, the organization and discipline of the\r\nNational Guard of the State of New York, and for the public defense,”\r\nthe uniformed and equipped militia of the State became recognized as the\r\nNational Guard. The 69th Militia as the 69th regiment, National Guard,\r\nentered the service of the United States in May of that year and served\r\nuntil the September following, when it was mustered out. It was again in\r\nthe service of the United States for the thirty days between June 25th\r\nand July 25th, 1863, and again in 1864, it was mustered into the service\r\nof the general government for three months, or until October of that\r\nyear. Colonel Bagley was in command of the regiment during these years\r\nand until February, 1866, when General Martin T. McMahon was selected to\r\nsucceed him. This distinguished citizen soldier merits more than passing\r\nnotice. He, with two of his brothers, served with distinction during the\r\ngreat war; one of them—John Eugene McMahon, Colonel of the 164th\r\nRegiment, New York Volunteers, Corcoran Legion, died of disease\r\ncontracted in the service in March, 1863, and the other, James Powers\r\nMcMahon, who after serving as Lieutenant Colonel of the 155th New York\r\nVolunteers, was selected to succeed his deceased brother as Colonel of\r\nthe 164th. This daring soldier was killed in action at Cold Harbor, June\r\n3, 1864, while planting the colors of his regiment on the breastworks of\r\nthe enemy, in the midst of a hailstorm of bullets, and performing “as\r\nproud a feat of arms” as was ever recorded in history. The following\r\nextract of a letter from General Thomas Francis Meagher shortly\r\npreceding his death describes in glowing words the heroism of James P.\r\nMcMahon, at Cold Harbor:\r\n\r\n“Next came the news that McMahon—planting his colors with his own hands\r\non the enemy’s works—planting them there with a boldness worthy of the\r\ngrand soldier name he bore, and which perhaps the recollection of the\r\nMalakoff and its Irish Conqueror may have inspired, was stricken down by\r\nthe bullets he so splendidly defied. Who of the old Brigade—the favorite\r\nBrigade of Sumner and Richardson—can forget the dashing, handsome,\r\nindefatigable soldier, with his strictly defined features, oftentimes\r\nwith the enthusiasm, sometimes with the scorn and haughtiness of a true\r\nblooded Celt, with a heart for hospitality, with a soul for glory, and\r\nscorn and sarcasm for what was mean, and a quick look and blow for what\r\nwas treacherous—who can forget his fine bearing, erect and graceful, his\r\nrare heartiness, the decisive character of his intellect, his high\r\npride, his humor, his physical activity, all those healthy and superior\r\ngifts which made him a soldier at the start, and qualified him even in\r\nthe first hours of boyhood to be a conspicuous exponent of his martial\r\nrace and kindred—who can forget all this whenever that grand picture of\r\nMcMahon, planting the colors of his regiment in the face of the fire\r\nstorm, and foot to foot with the desperate foe, is spoken of in the Camp\r\nand by the Survivors of the Irish Brigade of the Army of the Potomac?”\r\n\r\nThe survivor of these three young Irish American brothers, General\r\nMartin T. McMahon, had a distinguished career alike in civil and in\r\nmilitary life. He was appointed Captain and Aide-de-Camp on the Staff of\r\nGeneral George B. McClellan, October 25, 1861, and on the 29th of\r\nOctober, 1862, became Adjutant and Chief of Staff of the 6th Army Corps,\r\nsuccessively commanded by Colonels W. B. Franklin, John Sedgwick, and\r\nHoratio G. Wright. He was brevetted Colonel August 1st, 1864, and\r\nBrigadier and Major General, March 13, 1865. In civil life General\r\nMcMahon was most distinguished; he was a member of the Bar of the State\r\nof New York, of recognized standing and ability for a great many years,\r\nand served as a public officer in the National, State and City\r\nGovernments with ability and integrity, winning general public approval.\r\nHe was appointed United States Minister to Paraguay in 1868, and was\r\nsubsequently Corporation Attorney of New York City, Receiver of Taxes,\r\nand in 1885 was appointed by President Cleveland United States Marshal\r\nfor the Southern District of New York. He served in the Senate and\r\nAssembly of the State of New York, and at the time of his lamented death\r\non April 21, 1906, was a Judge of the Court of General Sessions, the\r\nhighest court of exclusive criminal jurisdiction. His honored remains\r\nwere accorded soldierly sepulchre in the National Cemetery at Arlington,\r\nwhere thousands of his comrades of war’s dread days rest peacefully,\r\nawaiting the trumpet of the resurrection, and over whose arched\r\nentrances are engraven the touching lines of the hero-poet:\r\n\r\n                   On fame’s eternal camping ground\r\n                     Their silent tents are spread,\r\n                   And glory guards with solemn round\r\n                     The bivouac of the dead.\r\n\r\nA splendid type of an American and a true scion of the stock that has\r\nfurnished statesmen and soldiers to many lands and had given to the\r\nSecond French Empire its ablest Marshal, and to the Republic of France a\r\nPresident, whose fame is so universal that a single descriptive word\r\nwould be superfluous.\r\n\r\nGeneral McMahon’s successor was Colonel James Cavanagh, a veteran of one\r\nhundred fields, known to many of us and beloved by all, who was retired\r\nDecember 1st, 1893, with brevet rank of Brigadier General, who was\r\nfollowed in command by Colonel George Moore Smith, August 9, 1895, who,\r\non July 1, 1901, was commissioned Brigadier General, and in October\r\nfollowing was assigned to the command of the First Brigade of the\r\nNational Guard.\r\n\r\nThe breaking out of the War with Spain in the Spring of 1898 afforded\r\nanother opportunity for the conspicuous display of the spirit of valor\r\nand loyalty that at all times animates the officers and men of the 69th.\r\nMajor General Roe, the commander of the National Guard of the State of\r\nNew York, at that time was desirous of ascertaining the number of\r\nmembers in the different regiments that could be relied upon to\r\nvolunteer for service beyond the territorial boundaries of the State,\r\nand directed the various regimental commanders to question their\r\nofficers and men upon the subject. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Duffy was\r\nthen in command of the 69th, and his answer was immediate and\r\ncharacteristic: “The 69th will volunteer to a unit to serve anywhere\r\nthat the country might require its services.” Upon his return to the\r\nArmory after this interview with General Roe, Colonel Duffy issued Order\r\nNo. 47, which bears date April 1st, 1898, and contains the following\r\nstirring words:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The Commanding Officer, mindful of the record and traditions of the\r\n  regiment, rests assured of the enthusiastic support and co-operation\r\n  of every member, and takes occasion to impress upon all the necessity\r\n  for the vigorous recruiting of the different companies, so that our\r\n  ranks may be swelled to full numbers. The example of our heroic\r\n  predecessors of 1861 should be always before us, and it should be our\r\n  pride to emulate their glorious conduct if called upon to vindicate\r\n  the nation’s honor and defend in any quarter the flag of our country.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strength of the regiment at this time was thirty-one officers and\r\nfive hundred and twenty-nine enlisted men. On the 28th of April Colonel\r\nDuffy received authority to recruit the regiment to twelve companies of\r\nthree officers and eighty-one men each, and so rapidly was this work\r\nperformed, that on the 2d of May the regiment left its armory for Camp\r\nBlack, Hempstead Plains, Long Island, with full ranks, and was mustered\r\ninto the service of the United States on May 19th following, on which\r\noccasion it was presented with a stand of colors by the Friendly Sons of\r\nSt. Patrick of the City of New York. Describing the scene of this\r\npresentation in _The Criterion_ the distinguished Irish-American\r\ndramatist, poet and journalist, Joseph I. C. Clarke,[4] said:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The deeper notes in the diapason of history vibrate in us, and Irish\r\n  brigades of other centuries and other lands seem once more enacting\r\n  their outlined braveries beneath many skies, under many banners\r\n  fluttering in a breeze as fresh as that blowing cool and damp in our\r\n  faces now. In a good round voice a civilian orator, Judge Fitzgerald,\r\n  is telling without oratorical periphrase what the gathering means. His\r\n  sentences tell clearly that the thousand men before him love the great\r\n  land of their adoption, the great State that sends them forth and the\r\n  land that gave them or their fathers birth—a Shamrock of love, he says\r\n  poetically. As he speaks, flag after flag is unfurled—first the red,\r\n  white and blue of the Stars and Stripes, eagle crowned; next the white\r\n  figured flag of the State of New York, and last the green sunburst\r\n  flag of Ireland, surmounted by a gold pikehead, all brave and\r\n  beautiful, and each one flapping and whipping from its staff like a\r\n  great tropical bird first trying its bright wings upon the wind. Cheer\r\n  upon cheer rises from the crowd, and rolls back as in echo from the\r\n  regiment. Colonel Duffy salutes, and says briefly that his regiment\r\n  thanks the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick for their silken gift, and\r\n  says for his men that they will carry the flags to the war with pride\r\n  and bring them home without stain. It is all very simple and in\r\n  proportion touching.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regiment left Camp Black, on Hempstead Plains, for Chickamauga,\r\nunder orders to report to General John R. Brooke, of the United States\r\nArmy, at that point, and its march through the City of New York on May\r\n24th was a memorable and notable event. The _New York Herald_ of the\r\nsucceeding day said:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Not since the stirring days of ‘ ’61’ has New York so thrilled with\r\n  patriotic fervor as it did yesterday, when the 69th Regiment marched\r\n  through the city on its way to the front. If they had been\r\n  battle-scarred heroes of one hundred fights, Colonel Duffy and his\r\n  boys could not have received a more enthusiastic welcome than that\r\n  which greeted them. From East to West through the city they marched\r\n  amid a flourish of flags, and the tramp of their feet was lost in the\r\n  cheers that roared from tens of thousands of throats. Fifth Avenue and\r\n  Tenth Avenue united in enthusiasm. Truck drivers and longshoremen did\r\n  not shout louder than bankers and clubmen, and the fluttering flags in\r\n  Fifth Avenue were not less numerous than the banners that waived from\r\n  factories and tenements.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-joined is a list of the officers composing the Field, Staff and Line\r\nof the Regiment as it marched through the City on that bright May day,\r\nwhen, after thirty-five years of peace, the dark shadow of war again\r\nclouded the horizon of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FIELD AND STAFF.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Colonel—Edward Duffy.\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant Colonel—Joseph L.

June 5th it was placed\r\nin the 2d Brigade of the 3d Division, commanded by General Guy V. Henry,\r\nand was sent forward to Fernandina, Florida. The regiment was honored by\r\nvisits from Governor Black of New York, Governor Shaw of Iowa, and\r\nSecretary of War Alger, and took part in the general review of the 4th\r\nCorps, at Huntsville, Alabama, September 23, 1898. Impressed with the\r\nappearance of the regiment upon this occasion, the Brigade Commander\r\naddressed the following note of congratulation to Colonel Duffy:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_My dear Colonel_:\r\n\r\n  “I desire to express my admiration of the magnificent appearance made\r\n  by your regiment today. The Sixty-ninth is certainly a fine example of\r\n  the volunteer soldier, and you can well, with your brother officers,\r\n  feel proud of so efficient a regiment. Promptness is the foundation of\r\n  all military efficiency; your command was halted in position assigned\r\n  for the formation for review exactly on time. With best wishes for\r\n  yourself and splendid command.\r\n\r\n                               “Respectfully,\r\n                                   “(Signed) JAMES RUSH LINCOLN,\r\n                                             “_Brigadier General Vols._”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regiment remained in the service of the United States until the 31st\r\nof January, 1899, on which date it returned home and received a\r\nmagnificent welcome, significantly demonstrative of the warm affection\r\nand pride in which its officers and men were held by the people of the\r\nCity of New York. On the evening of this day the regiment was honorably\r\nmustered out of the service of the United States. Upon its discharge by\r\nthe general government, the regiment at once resumed its former position\r\nin the National Guard of the State.\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of the new Armory was laid April 23, 1904, the\r\nforty-fourth anniversary of the departure of the regiment for the Civil\r\nWar. This splendidly equipped building, from a military standpoint, on\r\nthe west side of Lexington Avenue, between 25th and 26th Streets, was\r\ncompleted within two years. It occupies the entire front on the Avenue,\r\nextending in depth over 300 feet, and is provided with every modern\r\nrequirement. On October 13, 1906, the regiment left its old armory over\r\nTompkins Market, and made its formal entry into its new home, on which\r\noccasion it was escorted by the 7th Regiment, the Old Guard, 1st and 2d\r\nBatteries of New York, and the 9th Regiment of Boston, that justly\r\nrenowned Irish-American Military organization of the old Bay State.\r\n\r\nAt the Dinner given by the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick on the evening\r\nof May 20, 1902, in honor of the representatives of the government of\r\nthe French Republic, at the unveiling of the Rochambeau Statue at\r\nWashington, the delegates were escorted by the 69th to Delmonico’s. In\r\nresponse to a toast, Admiral Fournier of the French Navy said: “The 69th\r\nRegiment reminded me by its very appearance of a crack French regiment\r\non parade.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CAPTAIN JAMES CONNOLLY,\r\n\r\n  of Coronado, Cal.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for California.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAgain on the 17th of March, 1905, the regiment escorted the Hon.\r\nTheodore Roosevelt to the 121st Annual Dinner of the Friendly Sons of\r\nSt. Patrick, the first appearance of Mr. Roosevelt at any public\r\nfunction in his native city after his installation in the high office of\r\nPresident of the United States for the term for which he had been\r\nelected. In his address upon that occasion President Roosevelt said:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I wish to express at the outset my special sense of obligation—and I\r\n  know that no one present will grudge me doing so—my special sense of\r\n  obligation to Colonel Duffy and the officers and men of the 69th, who\r\n  were my escort today. I shall write Col. Duffy later making formal\r\n  acknowledgment to the regiment of my appreciation, but I wish to\r\n  express it thus fully tonight.”\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Duffy commanded the regiment during the Spanish War and for many\r\nyears after its discharge from the service of the United States and\r\nreturn to its position in the National Guard of the State. He is\r\nentitled to great credit for the energy, industry and persistency with\r\nwhich he labored, happily successfully, to secure for the regiment the\r\nnew armory into which he had the pleasure of leading it.

Not many of the heroic followers of Corcoran\r\nand Meagher are within its ranks today, but a few, thank God, are still\r\nhappily left among us. Each year their diminishing ranks are being still\r\nfurther thinned by the inexorable ravages of time. They are but few\r\nindeed, and all the more for this reason we delight in honoring them.\r\nBrave veterans, may you long be spared to illustrate by your simple\r\nlives the virtues of patriotism and courage, and to inspire the soldier\r\nsons of the Republic with a desire to emulate your daring and sacrifice.\r\nCaptain O’Connell, the President of the Corps, has kindly furnished me\r\nwith the names of the survivors at present upon the roll of those who\r\nfollowed the colors from ’61 to ’65:\r\n\r\n  Captain James J. Smith.\r\n  Captain John O’Connell.\r\n  Captain Garrett Nagle.\r\n  Captain John R. Nugent.\r\n  Captain Thomas M. Canton.\r\n  Lieutenant Richard R.

He had the privilege of delivering the oration upon the occasion\r\nof the laying of the cornerstone of the new armory, and was called upon\r\nto preside at the memorable ceremonies attending the formal opening of\r\nthe completed building. The great consideration at all times shown him\r\nwill be ever gratefully remembered, and it is his hope that this paper,\r\nprepared at the request of the American-Irish Historical Society, may\r\nserve in slight degree to perpetuate the well-earned glory of an\r\nhistoric and gallant corps, which we trust may long remain a notable and\r\nreliable unit in the military forces of the United States. Neither the\r\nelements of social disorder laboring from within to undermine the fabric\r\nof our Constitution, nor the international complications possible to\r\narise, by which our people may be subjected to the perils of foreign\r\nwar, can menace our beloved country with permanent danger as long as the\r\nmanhood of the Nation is animated by the spirit and courage associated\r\nwith the history and traditions of the 69th Regiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHN LOUIS SHEEHAN, LL.

D. of Boston University School of Law._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn scanning the pages of American history, one pauses at the name of\r\nStonewall Jackson. In imagination the reader goes back more than half a\r\ncentury, to fields of fierce conflict where a nation was drenched in\r\nhuman blood. He hears the cry of the torn and mangled, the roar and\r\nshriek of the bursting shell, and when for a moment the flash of cannon\r\nclears away the smoke of battle, there is seen the form of one admired\r\nby all, the ingenious, the courageous, the redoubtable Jackson.\r\n\r\nNerve and a spirit of independence appears in his great grandmother,\r\nElizabeth Cummins, a woman over six feet tall, who quarreled with her\r\nfather and left for America, after throwing a silver tankard at his\r\nhead, while he was keeper of “The Bold Dragoon” in London. On her\r\narrival she married John Jackson, a man of Irish birth. Later on, when\r\nyoung Jackson compared notes, he found that his ancestors came from the\r\nsame parish in Londonderry as those of President Andrew Jackson. The\r\nmarried couple settled on a farm in northwestern Virginia. It was out of\r\nthis stock that our hero was born about January 21, 1824.\r\n\r\nJonathan Jackson, the father of Thomas Jonathan, retained little of the\r\nmettle of the early pioneers. His health, credit, and fortune were\r\ngambled away, and he died leaving his widow and four children to the\r\ncare of his relatives. Stonewall was three years old at this time. Four\r\nyears later, called to the bedside of his mother, he witnessed all that\r\nwas mortal of her pass out of this life.\r\n\r\nThe orphan went to live with his uncle, Cummins Jackson, who gave him\r\ncomplete freedom in the open air. The boy became a good rider and grew\r\nfond of all out door sports. These days spent among remote kin were\r\nlooked upon by him as the saddest of his life; he never cared to talk\r\nabout them for this reason. Yet his temper as a boy was cheerful and\r\ngenerous. He had a high regard for truth, and his sense of justice was\r\nvery strong. He was quick to resent an insult, would never yield to\r\ndefeat, but when fairly treated was always gentle and kind.\r\n\r\nHe was eighteen years old when he became a constable of Lewis County.\r\nThis office he held for a time, though the age required by law was\r\ntwenty-one. “But since a desire for knowledge had been the passion of\r\nhis youth,” it is needless to say that he was glad to resign on\r\nreceiving an appointment to the military academy at West Point. On his\r\narrival at Washington, the congressman from his district, introduced him\r\nto the secretary of war, as a young man with a limited education, with\r\n“an honorable desire for improvement.” His conversation must have\r\npleased the secretary, for he said: “Go to West Point; and the first man\r\nwho insults you, knock him down, and have it charged to my account.” The\r\nterm at the academy having already began, the youth had to hasten to\r\nWest Point. Before leaving he climbed the roof of the Capitol, and\r\nlooked out over Washington. Nobody noticed him there, nobody looked for\r\nhim in that great city; but there came a time when folks did look for\r\nhim, and when the inhabitants shook at the mere mention of his name;\r\nyes, when the mere threat of an attack caused the greatest fear at\r\nWashington, and disturbed the whole United States.\r\n\r\nIt is said that he was a “gawky” youth, with an ill-looking jaw, wearing\r\nhomespun clothes, when he presented himself to the officers at West\r\nPoint. His appearance led the cadets to attempt fun at his expense. In a\r\nmeasure they were disappointed. After many trials they decided that the\r\nyoung fellow had come to stay. But Jackson did not make great progress\r\nin his studies. He could do the necessary riding and running, but he was\r\nslow in his book learning, and always two or three lessons behind his\r\nclass. He barely got through his mid-year examinations, yet this pass\r\ngave him courage, and he studied even after the taps “for lights out.”\r\nThe end of the first year, however, found him on safer ground.\r\n\r\nWhen his class was graduated at the end of four years, Jackson stood\r\nseventeenth among the seventy. The world was to hear of that class\r\nlater, for in it were many destined for distinguished honors; among them\r\nwere Generals A. P. Hill, Pickett, Maury, D. R. Jones, W. D. Smith, and\r\nWilcox of the Confederate Army, and Generals McClellan, Foster, Reno,\r\nStoneman, Couch, and Gibbon of the Federal Army. Jackson himself was no\r\nlonger an awkward boy, for the training and system at West Point had\r\nwrought a change which clung to him through life. He was kind and\r\ncourteous, but not altogether sociable and had only a few good friends.\r\n\r\nHe was now twenty-two years old, with the brevet rank of second\r\nlieutenant of artillery. Our country had already declared war against\r\nMexico, and when his whole class was ordered to the front, Jackson went\r\nto New Orleans from whence he sailed to Mexico. General Winfield Scott\r\nwas there, and Jackson joined his army at Vera Cruz. From this time on,\r\nfortune placed him in the centre of the stage. He took part in nearly\r\nall the great battles of this war. He was many times mentioned for\r\nbravery. At the storming of the Castle of Chapultepec, Captain Magruder\r\nrecommended him for promotion in the following words: “I beg leave to\r\ncall the attention of the Major General commanding, to the conduct of\r\nLieutenant Jackson of the First Artillery. If devotion, industry, talent\r\nand gallantry are the highest qualities of a soldier, then is he\r\nentitled to the distinction which their possession confers.” At once he\r\nwas brevetted a captain, and a little later made major. It is said “no\r\nother officer in the whole army in Mexico was promoted so often for\r\nmeritorious conduct or made so great a stride in rank.”\r\n\r\nOn September 14, the American Army occupied the city of Mexico. A\r\ngarrison was finally left to guard the city, and Jackson spent pleasant\r\ndays in this life of ease among the Mexican people. He learned their\r\nlanguage, and took part in some of their pastimes. It was here that\r\nreligion grew upon him. He began the study of the differing forms of\r\ncreeds and service taught by soldier chaplains, Mexican priests, and\r\ncitizen ministers. The Archbishop of Mexico explained to him the system\r\nof the Church of Rome, but Jackson was quite undecided when he had\r\nlistened to them all, and left his selection to a later day.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 the army vacated the city. Major Jackson was sent to Fort\r\nHamilton, on Long Island, where two uneventful years quickly passed. He\r\nwas next ordered to Fort Meade, near Tampa Bay, Florida, where he stayed\r\nfor six months. A pleasant change awaited him, for he was elected\r\nprofessor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Artillery Tactics\r\nat the Virginia Military Institute, where he went in March, 1851.\r\n\r\nIt was at Lexington, where the Shenandoah flows through the “Valley of\r\nVirginia,” that Jackson spent the next ten years, teaching the cadets,\r\nand very interesting work he found it. He loved every inch of the\r\nbeautiful grounds, and enjoyed every hour of those days. It was here\r\nthat he met Doctor White, a Presbyterian minister, in whom he found a\r\ncongenial “spiritual commanding officer.” After examination of all the\r\ncreeds, Jackson was baptized “a member of Doctor White’s congregation,”\r\nand began straightaway, with a zeal that was all his might, the business\r\nof leading a veritable “religious life,” and this life he lived to the\r\nletter, as far as it is possible for man to live it in this world.\r\n“Every act, it seemed to him, was fit occasion for a prayer,—prayer\r\nbefore he drank a glass of water, in the class-room, a blessing on his\r\nscholars, on mailing a letter, an appeal for the person to whom it was\r\nsent,—silent prayers in most cases; for there appeared little of the\r\nRoundhead in this simple man, who could speak out when he thought it\r\nnecessary, but shrank from uncalled for show.”\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Jackson was married to Elinor, daughter of President Junkin, of\r\nWashington College. Less than one happy year were they together, for she\r\ndied in childbirth, and Jackson sank in despair.\r\n\r\nThere have been many descriptions of this Major Jackson. He is described\r\nas being “tall, erect, muscular, with uncommonly large hands and feet,\r\nand with a diffident manner of meeting people that was exaggerated by\r\nhis habitually awkward movements. He walked, it is said, like a\r\ndismounted horseman; in the saddle sat loosely, in a kind of slovenly\r\nease, unless, as later, in battle, he was moved by excitement, when his\r\nwhole body became rigid with martial lines, and he rode with a\r\ndistinction as imposing, almost, as that of ‘the man on the horse\r\nhimself.’ The heavy (bearded) jaw, however, was not square, but oval,\r\nand Jackson’s eyes, which were large and blue, had a trace of soft light\r\nin them not accounted for in this picture of an iron warrior.”\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Major Jackson visited Europe. He scanned every inch of the\r\n“beaten path,” and in gratifying his curiosity went to the Battlefield\r\nof Waterloo. While he felt that Napoleon was the greatest of commanders,\r\nhe was sure that he made an error in choosing the Chateau of Hugomont as\r\nthe vital point of attack on the British line; it should have been the\r\nvillage of Mont St. Jean.\r\n\r\nIn this far away land, his thoughts wandered back to the country of his\r\nbirth, and to a dear little girl he had known before his marriage. He\r\nmade her his wife a year after his return. They led a plain, simple,\r\nChristian life.\r\n\r\nJackson, a keen observer, saw at last the dark clouds of rebellion on\r\nthe horizon. These signs meant much to him, and, like many another, he\r\nwas greatly concerned.\r\n\r\nThough Jackson took no active part in the secession arguments, he\r\nnevertheless came to the definite conclusion that the northern states\r\nwere using the power of the Washington government for the private\r\nadvantage of their section, and were seeking to oppress the south. He\r\nbelieved that the Lord had ordained slavery, but apart from this he\r\nstood for “the right of the sovereign state.” Said he: “The South ought\r\nto take its stand on the outer verge of its just rights, and then resist\r\naggression, if necessary, by the sword,” and when the war came at last,\r\nthere was no question in his mind on which side he was to fight. He\r\nthought of the days under the “Old Flag,” and what those days had been\r\nto him; yet after all, he felt that the “act of his state” absolved\r\nhim,—Virginia was with the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThe feeling was now running high in the South. At a meeting of the\r\nmilitary academy, where Jackson was called upon to speak, he arose\r\nduring the cheers of those present, and said: “Soldiers, the time may\r\ncome when your state will need your services, and, if that time does\r\ncome, then draw your swords and throw away the scabbards.”\r\n\r\nIt was on a Sunday morning that Governor Letcher sent the order for\r\nJackson to march his cadets to Richmond. Then he turned them over to his\r\nsuperior officer. Promotions were taking place, commands were given out\r\nto some who had had no war experience. He was now getting anxious, when\r\nhe was about to be sent to the engineers’ department. Friends from his\r\ndistrict interfered with such effect that he was given a commission as\r\ncolonel of Virginia troops, and the command of Harper’s Ferry.\r\n\r\nGeneral Beauregard held a position about sixty miles away across the\r\nBlue Ridge Mountains. Near Manassas Junction and the Bull Run water, was\r\nthe Union General McDowell. President Davis received on July 17\r\nBeauregard’s telegram: “The enemy has assaulted my outposts in heavy\r\nforce—send forward any reinforcements at the earliest possible instant,\r\nand by every possible means.” The first Virginia Brigade of Johnson’s\r\narmy marching with Jackson were reserved in the woods at Bull Run to\r\nsupport the left. McClellan made his first attack on the twenty-first at\r\nthis point. The battle had waged but a short time, when it looked bad\r\nfor the Confederate side. Federal troops were rapidly moving to the\r\nfront of the stream, and the Confederate line gave way. Jackson steadied\r\nhis men as the Carolina and Georgia troops rushed into the ravine. They\r\nlistened not to the shouting of their generals, Johnson and Beauregard.\r\nThe enemy turned to destroy Jackson’s line, and complete their victory,\r\nwhen General Bee cried, “General, they are beating us back.” The deep\r\nlines stood out on Jackson’s firm face as he replied, “Well, we will\r\ngive them the bayonet.” Bee rode up to his men and shouted, “Look, there\r\nis Jackson standing like a stonewall.” This rallying cry went through\r\nthe lines, the men turned and advanced, and Jackson gave the order to\r\ncharge,—“and yell like fury.” The Federal troops fell back, and this,\r\nthe first great Confederate victory, was won.\r\n\r\nContrary to custom Jackson did not go into winter quarters at\r\nWinchester. He wanted to go ahead. He felt that the duty of a soldier\r\nwas to seek out the enemy and fight him. This, he said, was the only way\r\nto shorten the war. Accordingly he prepared to attack the Federal forces\r\nat Bath and at Romney, up in the northwest. But the winter was a severe\r\none, and his men suffered greatly. The way was covered with ice and\r\nsnow. Thy had to cut through the untraveled roads; the horses could not\r\nget a footing on the ice, and two miles a day were all they could make.\r\nHis men were dissatisfied; others spread the news in Winchester of\r\nJackson’s ill luck, and he was criticised severely. General Loring wrote\r\nto Richmond of the danger of an attack on Winchester, and the secretary\r\nof war telegraphed Jackson to recall his general. Jackson was displeased\r\nat this. He felt on the whole that his campaign was successful. He was\r\nindignant at the action of the war department, and, ordering General\r\nLoring to return to Winchester, resigned from the army. General Johnson\r\ndelayed the letter, and wrote to Jackson, approving of the Romney and\r\nBath expeditions. Private citizens petitioned him not to resign, for the\r\nConfederacy needed him. The “Governor of Virginia sent a kind of\r\nambassador to treat” with him, and later President Davis refused to\r\nconsider the acceptance of the resignation, and the governor personally\r\nwithdrew it. Jackson, with “views unchanged,” remained with his command.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan had now made up his mind to capture the Confederate\r\ncapital. General Banks commanded the right wing at Harper’s Ferry. His\r\nplan was for Banks to force out all the southern troops from the valley,\r\nthen fall in with the army before Richmond. McClellan, thinking that\r\nJackson had fled from the valley, drew some of the Banks forces to him.\r\nJackson immediately returned and attacked the enemy at Kernstown, near\r\nWinchester. The firing was hot and bloody, and the Confederate troops,\r\nunder Gannett in the centre, retired from the field, and the whole army\r\nfled after them. One-fourth of Jackson’s command was lost, but he was\r\nsatisfied that the Federal loss was greater than his own, and that the\r\nobject of the attack had been gained. Banks had to stay in the valley,\r\nthe regiments which started to join McClellan were recalled, and in the\r\nfollowing April, President Lincoln withdrew McDowell’s whole corps to\r\ndefend the Capitol at Washington.\r\n\r\nJackson’s successful operation had gained much for the cause of\r\nsecession, and the Confederate government, to help him carry out his\r\nplans, determined to let him have all the troops it could spare from the\r\ndefense of Richmond.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1862, Jackson found himself at Bull Pasture. On the eighth day\r\nMilroy hit the “Stonewall Brigade,” and brought on the battle of\r\nMcDowell. During the three hours of fighting Jackson lost heavily in\r\nkilled and wounded. When night came on, the enemy lighting misleading\r\ncamp fires, retreated under the protection of Freemont. The Federals\r\nreported a victory in this battle, and “God blessed our armies at\r\nMcDowell yesterday,” was the despatch Jackson sent to President Davis.\r\nEwell was immediately sent for, and Jackson started out for General\r\nBanks.\r\n\r\nOn May 23, the Union forces held Fort Royal against him, then fled to\r\nBanks, who was on a quick run to beat Jackson into Winchester. Banks\r\nwon, and planted his batteries on the outskirts of the town. Jackson\r\nshelled him, and Ewell’s brigade drove the Federals through the town.\r\nJackson rested here for two days before marching on to Harper’s Ferry.\r\nHe wanted to invade the North, but Lee insisted that he first help him\r\ndrive the enemy away from Richmond. When Jackson received word to go\r\nback into the mountains where he would be safe he answered: “Give me\r\nfewer orders, and more men.” He evidently did not appreciate the danger,\r\nfor Lincoln had already ordered Freemont to join McDowell and Shields\r\nand capture Jackson. A long march was ahead of him, and there was no\r\ntime to lose. His infantry which was called “foot cavalry,” on account\r\nof its reputation for fast marching, had to travel forty miles to\r\nStrasburg. Freemont could not reach them in time to do harm. Shields\r\ntook a wrong road, and could not repair bridges in time to overtake\r\nJackson, who, after a few skirmishes, reached Port Republic for a two\r\ndays’ rest.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, June 8, Shields pierced his lines, and Jackson was almost\r\ntaken prisoner. Ewell and Freemont began the fighting at Cross Keys.\r\nJackson crossed the stream and joined them. Shields beat him back, and\r\nit was only the arrival of Confederate reinforcements that saved the day\r\nfor Jackson. He made a flank attack, and Shields retreated. The\r\n“Stonewall Brigade” now got a much needed rest of five days.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, General Lee wrote Jackson: “Your recent successes have been\r\nthe cause of the liveliest joy in this army as well as in the country.”\r\nThere was no doubt now as to Jackson’s standing as a soldier, and he was\r\nadmired and loved by his men. This confidence in him is expressed by a\r\nsong written by one of his soldiers, which carried them many times into\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n                He’s in the saddle now! Fall in!\r\n                Steady, the whole Brigade!\r\n                Hill’s at the Ford, cut off!—we’ll win\r\n                His way out, ball and blade!\r\n                What matter if our shoes are worn?\r\n                What matter if our feet are torn?\r\n                Quick step, we’re with him before morn!\r\n                That’s Stonewall Jackson’s way.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, General Lee called to his headquarters for consultation,\r\nGenerals A. P. Hill, D. H. Hill and Longstreet of the army before\r\nRichmond. Jackson was there, after fifty miles of continuous riding\r\nduring the night. Lee told them of his plan to attack the Federal right\r\nwing, and left the details to them. At the end of the discussion\r\nLongstreet said to Jackson: “As you have the longest march to make and\r\nare likely to meet opposition, you had better fix the time for the\r\nattack to begin.”\r\n\r\nSaid Jackson: “Daylight of the 26th.”\r\n\r\nLongstreet said: “You will encounter Federal cavalry, and roads blocked\r\nby felled timber, if nothing more formidable. Ought you not to give\r\nyourself more time?”\r\n\r\n“No, daylight of the 26th,” and Jackson returned to his men. Blunders\r\nand mistakes delayed Jackson.\r\n\r\nIn two days he was at Ashland. He spent the nights following moving\r\nabout his men, giving orders and praying for his success. Daylight of\r\nthe 26th did not find him moving, and it was seven o’clock before his\r\narmy got under way. The generals waited for him, and finally A. P. Hill\r\nopened his batteries on Mechanicsville “to hurry Stonewall Jackson on.”\r\nThe Confederates made an attack on the enemy at Beaver Dam Creek; “but\r\nthere was no Jackson to turn the Federal right.” The Confederates\r\nretreated with terrible loss. Night saw Jackson’s approach. At daybreak\r\nthe enemy, learning of this, retreated down the Chickahominy toward\r\nGaines Mill and Cold Harbor. Jackson was after them. The firing of the\r\nheavy guns told him that the fight was getting hotter. Jackson had gone\r\nout of his way, and it was feared that Hill’s command would be shattered\r\nbefore he could arrive, because Longstreet was held back to join with\r\nJackson in the attack. Lee sent word to Longstreet that, unless he could\r\nmove forward, the day would be lost. At this moment, two of Jackson’s\r\nbrigades joined Longstreet. Jackson’s men did not seem to find their\r\nplaces. They were disorganized. Jackson, calling Captain Pendleton to\r\nhim, said: “Go to the line and see all the commanders. Tell them this\r\nthing has hung in suspense too long. Sweep the field with the bayonet.”\r\n\r\nMcClellan, considering himself defeated, marched southeastward toward\r\nthe James River, under the protection of gunboats. A. P. Hill and\r\nLongstreet were sent to head him off. Jackson was to attack the Federal\r\nrear. Hill and Longstreet attacked McClellan at Frayzer’s Farm, but\r\nJackson was a day behind the battle, and when he reached White Oak\r\nSwamp, the roads were blocked, bridges were burned, and the guns of the\r\nenemy were trained upon the fords. He withdrew, and McClellan retreated\r\nagain when the Frayzer’s Farm battle was over.\r\n\r\nMeantime people were asking: “What was the matter with Jackson?” His\r\nactions puzzled them. His delays had been costly to the Confederacy. He\r\nseemed to be not the same fighter of old. But, as General D. H. Hill\r\nsaid, “Jackson’s genius never shone when he was under the command of\r\nanother.” He seemed then to be shrouded or paralyzed. The fact was that\r\nhe was tired and worn out by the wet swamps; the fever and forced\r\nmarches. Lee’s plans having miscarried, he was now forced to attack\r\nMcClellan on Malvern Hill. His loss was terrible. When the Federal\r\ngeneral withdrew, they were a little easier at the Confederate capitol.\r\n\r\nPope was now in command of the Federal Army of Virginia. It was one of\r\nthe finest armies that ever faced a foe. Lee sent Jackson to fence with\r\nhim. Jackson immediately called for reinforcements and rested his horses\r\nand men while awaiting a reply. In August, A. P. Hill came to his aid.\r\nPope was now on the Rappahannock. When Jackson moved to attack him,\r\nBanks met him with all his strength in the Battle of Cedar Mountain,\r\nAugust 9. Banks seemed to be winning the battle, for the Confederate\r\ncentre was broken, but Jackson’s supports turned the balance the other\r\nway. Jackson wrote to Lee: “On the evening of the 9th inst. God blessed\r\nour armies with another victory.” General Lee now joined Jackson at\r\nGordonsville. The Federal Army was at Culpepper Court House. Pope took\r\nshelter across the river, and Lee conceived a plan to drive him out.\r\nStonewall Jackson was selected for this work. On the 25th he began the\r\nmove “in his old-time mystery” across the Rappahannock and marched away\r\nfrom the Federals, turning at right angles in the morning toward the\r\nline of the Federal communication with Washington. He passed\r\nThoroughfare Gap, and fell on the enemy’s depot of supplies at Manassas\r\nJunction. One of Pope’s despatches, captured the next day, disclosed his\r\nplan to concentrate his forces at Manassas. Acting upon this, Jackson\r\nadvanced and met the enemy on the old field of Bull Run. Jackson held\r\nhis position in this bloody fight, and when the enemy fell back at\r\nmidnight, he was content not to follow him.\r\n\r\nBoth sides were ready at dawn of day. Longstreet just reached the field\r\nas Pope with his whole army ploughed the Confederate lines. Lee, now\r\nJackson’s superior, helped win another victory for the South.\r\n\r\nThe great leader of the Confederate army evidently understood General\r\nJackson. He gave him something to accomplish, then let him alone. He had\r\nnow something of importance in his mind. It was the capture of Harper’s\r\nFerry. Lee was going to invade the North. The army crossed the Potomac\r\nand entered Frederick City. Stonewall Jackson was riding ahead. They\r\noccupied the city for several days. Meanwhile the Federal forces were\r\ngathering around Washington. The garrison at Harper’s Ferry did not move\r\nand Lee on September 10 sent Jackson to assault it. Four days later the\r\nwhite flag was raised over it. The men were taken prisoners, and their\r\narms, ammunition, and supplies came to Jackson’s men. Immediately, he\r\njoined Lee at Sharpsburg; he was wanted, for McClellan was at Antietam\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MOST REVEREND JOHN M. FARLEY, D. D., LL. D.,\r\n\r\n  Archbishop of New York.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt midnight of the 16th a part of Jackson’s men again became engaged;\r\nand when “at the dawn of the 17th, Hooker made his terrible attack on\r\nthe left of the Confederate battle line, Stonewall Jackson stood in the\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nThe morning sun of this day looked down on a sight that was awful beyond\r\nconception. In the corn field at the Dunker Church the men fought and\r\nfell, cut down like the corn, in the order in which they were standing.\r\n“It was never my fortune to witness a more dismal battlefield,” Hooker\r\nwrote. “Terrible carnage,” said Jackson, and as he watched the deadly\r\nfire, planned a new attack.\r\n\r\nHe immediately formed his cavalry to turn the Federal right. “Move your\r\ndivisions to the front, and attack the enemy as soon as you hear\r\nStuart’s guns,” he said. “We’ll drive McClellan into the Potomac.” But\r\nStuart’s guns were not heard, for the enemy was already on the river.\r\nThe Federals next pressed A. P. Hill’s division; but he was helped in\r\nholding possession by the arrival of the remainder of the troops from\r\nHarper’s Ferry. Lee crossed the Potomac, and the final victory was with\r\nMcClellan. The forces remained for three months in camp.\r\n\r\nJackson was made a lieutenant-general in October of this year. Lee now\r\nsaid of him: “Such an executive officer the sun never shone on. I have\r\nbut to show him my design, and I know if it can be done, it will be\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nIn December, when Burnside moved toward Richmond, Lee went out to meet\r\nhim. In the battle of Fredericksburg, Jackson commanded the Confederate\r\nright, and resisted every attack. Longstreet held the left in this last\r\nvictory for the South, in this campaign.\r\n\r\nJackson’s wife and his child came to visit him at Hamilton’s Crossing.\r\nTo Mrs. Jackson he felt disposed to talk of the war. “We must make this\r\ncampaign an exceedingly active one,” he said. “Only thus can a weaker\r\ncountry cope with a stronger. It must make up in activity what it lacks\r\nin strength.”\r\n\r\nOn April 29, a messenger drew rein at his door. “General Early’s\r\nadjutant wishes to see General Jackson.” Jackson looked out and said:\r\n“That looks as if Hooker were crossing.” He was right. When Jackson’s\r\naide notified Lee, the latter remarked: “Say to your good general that\r\nhe knows what to do. I will join him at the front.” Jackson threw his\r\narmy against the enemy, who fell back on Chancellorsville.\r\n\r\nThe war department at Washington had made up its mind that the only\r\nthing to be done was to march steadily on to Richmond. Hooker faced the\r\nConfederates, determined to smash through their divisions. Lines of\r\ntelegraph were at his service, signal stations and captive balloons were\r\nready for his use. In the green fields behind him was “the finest army\r\non this planet,” as he himself said. There was no sleep in the\r\nConfederate camp on the night of the first of May. Lee and Jackson\r\ndiscussed plans of a circuit around Hooker’s right and an attack on his\r\nrear.\r\n\r\n“General Jackson,” said Lee, “what do you propose to do?”\r\n\r\n“Go around here.” Jackson’s finger moved on the map before them.\r\n\r\n“What do you propose to make this movement with?”\r\n\r\n“With my whole corps.”\r\n\r\n“What will you leave me?” Lee asked.\r\n\r\n“The divisions of Anderson and McLaws,” answered Jackson. Lee paused and\r\nthen said: “Well, go on.”\r\n\r\nJackson saluted, saying: “My troops will move at once, sir.”\r\n\r\nEverything was ready, every order was given, when Jackson looked at his\r\nwatch. It was six o’clock in the evening,—“You may go forward, sir.”\r\n\r\nThis whole Southern force moved like an avalanche on the unsuspecting\r\nFederals, who received a deadly fire from behind.\r\n\r\nThey ran before the advancing foe. Here and there they took a stand to\r\nresist the attack, then on again. Jackson followed them with his\r\npounding artillery. “Press right ahead, press them, press them,” cried\r\nJackson, as he rode by his men.\r\n\r\n“You should not expose yourself so much,” said a staff officer as he\r\ngrabbed his rein.\r\n\r\n“There is no danger, sir,” he replied; “the enemy is routed. Go back and\r\ntell General Hill to press on.” But Hooker appeared before the right of\r\nhis men, ordered a stand to be taken, and Jackson was obliged to stop\r\nand collect his scattered troops.\r\n\r\nBut half a mile now divided the Confederate and Federal lines; Jackson’s\r\nmen were scattered in the dark woods, and were running about,\r\n“disorderly as a city mob.” Divisions, brigades, companies, all were\r\nmixed. At nine o’clock the “rising moon lit dimly the broken, shadowed\r\nspaces of the battlefield.” Jackson and his staff were moving quietly\r\nabout. He drew rein one hundred yards away and listened. To the North\r\nCarolina brigade, they looked like Federal cavalry. The skirmish line\r\nfired a few shots towards the staff, then a whole company turned a\r\nvolley to the front; two officers fell. Jackson struck the spurs to his\r\nhorse and advanced toward the lines, when a regiment blazed out upon\r\nhim. His horse jumped and started in the direction of the enemy. The\r\nlimbs of the trees whipped the face of the rider, and Jackson’s arms\r\nfell to his side. He was lifted from his saddle to the ground, and Hill\r\nbent over him. “General, are you much hurt?” “I think I am,” said\r\nJackson, “and all the wounds are from my own men.”\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina soldiers stopped firing, but soon the battle began\r\nagain. As Jackson was being removed to the rear, he said: “Tell them\r\nsimply that you have a wounded officer.” But, as he passed, a soldier\r\ncried out: “Good God, it is General Jackson!”\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Jackson arrived on Sunday morning, May 10, Jackson was very\r\nlow. She told him he was going to die. He tossed about during the\r\nafternoon, and his mind began to be cloudy. In a restless sleep he\r\nmuttered, “Order A. P. Hill to prepare for action. Pass the infantry to\r\nthe front.” It was a little later, when he made his famous saying, “No,\r\nlet us pass over the river, and rest under the shade of the trees.” He\r\nspoke no more, but fell into the sleep which knows no waking.\r\n\r\n“Could I have dictated events,” wrote General Lee, “I should have\r\nchosen, for the good of the country, to have been disabled in your\r\nstead.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed strange that Jackson could die, he had survived danger so\r\nlong. It was at the closing of his grave on the hill at Lexington that\r\nhis deep loss was felt in the whole South. “The man was so much needed.\r\nHe had the mark of victory upon him, and his presence in the fight lent\r\nfaith to the cause everywhere.” A flower of the South had fallen, never\r\nto rise again.\r\n\r\nAt a dedication of a Jackson monument sometime afterwards in New\r\nOrleans, Father Hubert prayed, “God, when thou did’st decree that the\r\nConfederacy should not succeed, thou had’st first to take thy servant,\r\nStonewall Jackson.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the brief career of a poor orphan boy,—of a Christian and\r\npatriotic soldier,—of a descendant of an Irish immigrant, “who achieved\r\nthe last and greatest of his successes in dying for his country. He\r\nperished doubly a martyr, and in his last breath attested the\r\nrighteousness of the cause which he sealed with his blood.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          SOME IRISH CONTRIBUTIONS TO EARLY AMERICAN HISTORY.\r\n\r\n  _Paper read before the American Irish Historical Society, January 8,\r\n    1910, at its twelfth annual meeting at Hotel Plaza, New York City._\r\n\r\n                   BY MICHAEL XAVIER SULLIVAN, PH. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in the course of time a new nation has become firmly established\r\nand has taken its place among the powers of the world and leisure is\r\nafforded men to look back to the early days of their country in an\r\nhistorical way so dear to man’s heart, it is pleasing to the student to\r\nfind that the race from which he springs has played a prominent part\r\neven in the early days of his nation.\r\n\r\nIt is in such a spirit of pleasure that we find ourselves convinced on\r\nmaking but a preliminary survey of our early history that in the\r\nfoundation, the creating, the strengthening, and maintenance, of this\r\ngreat republic, the Irish race from which you and I spring has done its\r\nduty and has done it well.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the part the Irish race has played in this great land I\r\ndo not intend to indulge in self gratification, nor to give the Irish\r\ngreater praise than they deserve nor to take from others in extolling\r\nthose in whom ran the blood that runs in you and me. Every race that\r\nplayed its part in creating the American nation should be given its meed\r\nof praise, but in loving our land for what it has been to us and for\r\nwhat it has inspired, we are but the greater patriots in giving just\r\npraise to that race from which we spring for its noble duty in the cause\r\nof justice and of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe present paper does not purport to be a detailed study but merely\r\ntouches on the high points of the Irish contributions to early American\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1903, Miss Linehan[5] read a paper before the Connecticut\r\nHistorical Society. This paper contains an excellent account of the\r\nearliest immigration of Irish to this country. From her paper may be\r\nquoted:\r\n\r\n“The early Irish came to this country in three distinct periods, the\r\nfirst dating from 1621 to 1653, the second from 1653 to 1718, and the\r\nthird from the latter period to the Revolution.”\r\n\r\nIt is with the third period that we shall deal for the most part.\r\n\r\nIn 1737, according to Rev. J. A. Spencer,[6] “multitudes of laborers and\r\nhusbandmen in Ireland unable to procure a comfortable subsistence for\r\ntheir families in their native land embarked for Carolina. The same\r\nwriter again, Vol. 1, p. 214, speaking of New Hampshire in 1738, says:\r\n“the manufacture of linen was considerably increased by the coming of\r\nthe Irish Immigrant to this colony.”\r\n\r\n“During the whole period of her controversy with Britain,” says Mr.\r\nGrahame,[7] “America increased in strength from domestic growth and from\r\nthe flow of European emigration. No complete memorial has been\r\ntransmitted of the particulars of the emigration that took place from\r\nEurope to America at this period, but (from the few illustrative facts\r\nthat are actually preserved) they seem to have been amazingly copious.\r\nIn the year 1771 to 1772 the number of immigrants to America from the\r\nnorth of Ireland alone amount to 17,350, almost all of whom emigrated at\r\ntheir own charge, a great majority consisting of persons employed in the\r\nlinen manufacture or farmers and possessed of some property which they\r\nconverted into money and carried with them. Within the first fortnight\r\nof August, 1773, there arrived at Philadelphia three thousand five\r\nhundred emigrants from Ireland. About seven hundred Irish settlers\r\nrepaired to the Carolinas in the autumn of 1773.”\r\n\r\nPennsylvania very early had a large Irish colony. In 1699 James Logan\r\naccompanied William Penn to his new plantation and became one of the\r\nleading men. According to Spencer, Vol. 1, page 186, he was many years\r\ncolonial secretary and member of the Council. He governed the Colony for\r\ntwo years after the death of Penn’s widow and previously in Penn’s\r\nabsence. Charles Gookin, a gentleman of ancient Irish family, was\r\ngovernor of Pennsylvania from 1709 to 1716.\r\n\r\nAccording to Grahame, Vol. II., page 84, “In 1729 no fewer than six\r\nthousand two hundred and eight European settlers resorted to this\r\nProvince.” They are thus particularized by Anderson in his Historical\r\nDeductions of the Origin of Commerce; English and Welsh passengers and\r\nservants, 267; Scotch servants, 43; Irish passengers, 1,155; Palatine\r\npassengers, 243. At Newcastle, in Delaware, passengers and servants,\r\nchiefly from Ireland, 4,500.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Maryland was founded in 1634[8] by Cecilius Calvert, with\r\nLeonard Calvert as first Governor. Foremost among the Irish families\r\nearly in Maryland were the Carrolls, all of whom threw their influence\r\non the side of independence and at least three of whom played\r\nparticularly distinguished parts in the subsequent conflict. The first\r\nof them to come to Maryland was Charles Carroll, who was a clerk in the\r\noffice of Lord Powis in the reign of James the Second and who left\r\nIreland on the accession of William and Mary in 1689. Before he was two\r\nyears in Maryland he was appointed Judge and register of the land office\r\nand receiver of the rent of Lord Baltimore. His son, Charles Carroll,\r\nwas one of the most prominent men in the colony, whose son, Charles, was\r\na signer of the Declaration of Independence. Charles, the signer’s\r\ncousin, John Carroll, a priest of God, was sent with Franklin, Charles\r\nCarroll and Samuel Chase in 1776 to secure the coöperation of the French\r\nCatholics with the American cause. After the war, Father Carroll became\r\nBishop and Archbishop. Daniel Carroll, cousin of both Charles and John,\r\nwas one of the foremost members of the first Congress. He was a member\r\nof the Continental Congress for four years and a delegate to the\r\nconvention that framed the Constitution of the United States. His farm\r\nformed a part of the site of the present City of Washington. Associated\r\nwith him in Congress was Thomas Johnson, whose grandfather, also Thomas\r\nJohnson, came from Ireland in 1689 with Charles Carroll, the founder of\r\nthe Carroll family in Maryland. He was three times Governor of Maryland,\r\nChief Judge of the General Court of Maryland and Justice of the United\r\nStates Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nIn regard to South Carolina[9] Ramsay says, Vol. I., page 20, “Of all\r\nother countries none has furnished the province with so many inhabitants\r\nas Ireland. Scarcely a ship sailed from any of the ports that was not\r\ncrowded with men, women and children.” Among the prominent men of Irish\r\norigin were the Moores, Rutledges, Jacksons, Lynches, Polks, Calhouns,\r\nwho distinguished themselves as patriots and statesmen.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Kentucky, H. Marshall[10] says: “John Finley explored\r\nKentucky in 1767 and circulated accounts and descriptions which Boone\r\nauthenticated and enlarged.” Finley was the pilot of Boone in 1769. No\r\npermanent settlements were made in Kentucky till 1775. According to\r\nMarshall, page 13, in this year, a few permanent settlements were made,\r\nparticularly at Harrodsburg and at Logan’s Camp, later called St.\r\nAsaphs, and at Boonesborough, named after Boone, the leader of the first\r\ncolony to the bank of the Kentucky River.\r\n\r\nAssociated with Boone in his hazardous labors we find Michael Stoner.\r\n\r\nLogan, after whom the Camp was named, was of Irish parents, and was\r\namong the earliest settlers of Kentucky. He was a man of prominence. On\r\npage 42, Marshall says: “The names of Mrs. Denton and Mrs. McGary and\r\nMrs. Hogan are worthy of mention, they being the first white females who\r\nappeared with their husbands and children at Harrodsburg.” Speaking of\r\nMr. McGary he says: “For enterprise and daring courage none transcended\r\nMajor Hugh McGary.” Others were Butler, McLellan and Hogan, all\r\nIrishmen, pioneers and among the first to explore the country beyond the\r\nOhio. In the wars with Indians, Butler, Bulger and Logan were especially\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony legislated against the Irish of all creeds\r\nand in 1720 ordered them out. “As early as 1632,” however, as may be\r\nread in Haltigan’s “The Irish in the American Revolution,” we find\r\nmention of Irish in Boston. In an old legal document of that year an\r\nIrishman named Coogan is described as the first merchant of Boston. Miss\r\nLinehan, previously referred to, says: “In 1718 a petition was sent to\r\nGovernor Shute of Massachusetts by three hundred and twenty leading\r\nIrishmen, among whom were ministers, asking permission to settle in the\r\nState. The same year one hundred and twenty Irish families arrived in\r\nBoston and brought with them the manufacturing industry of linen and\r\nalso introduced the use of potatoes. There was not a town incorporated\r\nfrom that time on but what contained the descendants of those men or of\r\nthose who followed them directly.”\r\n\r\n“In 1730 the First Presbyterian Irish Church was founded in Boston.”\r\n\r\nThe Boston Irish Charitable Society was founded in 1737 on St. Patrick’s\r\nDay.\r\n\r\nJames Sullivan, son of Owen Sullivan, the emigrant from Limerick and\r\nbrother of General Sullivan, represented Massachusetts in Congress in\r\n1788 and was later Attorney General and Governor of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThat the Irish were fairly plentiful in Boston in pre-revolutionary days\r\nis well brought out by Cullen.[11] He found that among the earliest\r\nrecords there appeared such distinctly Irish names as Cogan, Barry,\r\nConnors, McCarty, and Kelly.\r\n\r\nIn the register of births, marriages and deaths in Boston from 1630 to\r\n1700 there was, according to Cullen, over two hundred entries of names\r\ndistinctly Irish and probably many others just as certainly Irish, but\r\nnot so entered. Under Cromwell’s government many Irish people were sent\r\nto New England. In 1654 the ship “Goodfellow,” Captain George Dell,\r\narrived in Boston with a large number of Irish immigrants that were sold\r\ninto service to such of the inhabitants as needed them. This service was\r\nonly temporary, to pay for the expense of transportation.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years, 1736–38, ten ships are on record as coming to\r\nBoston from Ireland with a total of nearly one thousand passengers.\r\n\r\nOn the rolls of Bunker Hill are very many purely Irish names.\r\n\r\n“In New Hampshire,” writes John C. Linehan,[12] “as early as 1631,\r\naccording to military records, the first representative of the Emerald\r\nIsle made his appearance in the person of Darby Field, an Irish\r\nSoldier.” According to the same writer, in Vol. I., “Provincial Papers,”\r\n1641 to 1660, are found such names as Duggan, Dermott, Gibbon, Vaughan,\r\nNeal, Patrick, Buckley, Kane, Kelly, Brian, Healey, Connor, MacMurphy,\r\nMalone, Murphy, Corbett, McClary, McMillen, Pendergast, Keily, McGowan,\r\nMcGinnis, Sullivan and Toole. Later records show that the Irish were\r\nvery numerous in the early days in New Hampshire, even long before the\r\nsettlement of Londonderry.\r\n\r\nLondonderry, New Hampshire, was settled by Irish Presbyterians in 1719.\r\nFew settlements were more prosperous. In the process of time, according\r\nto Barstow, in his “History of New Hampshire,” page 130 (1853), the\r\ndescendants of the Londonderry settlers spread over New Hampshire and\r\nVermont.\r\n\r\nBarstow speaks of them as Scotch, but as quoted by Linehan, p. 66, Rev.\r\nJames McSparran, an Irish Protestant Clergyman of Rhode Island, writing\r\nin 1752, referring to the New Hampshire settlement, says: “In the\r\nprovince lies that town called Londonderry—all Irish and famed for\r\nindustry and riches.”\r\n\r\nIn Maine, we may mention among the early Irish, the five O’Brien\r\nbrothers, of Machias, including Captain Jeremiah O’Brien, who fought and\r\nwon the first sea fight with the British. O’Brien’s exploits are well\r\ndescribed by the Rev. A. M. Sherman in “The Life of Captain Jeremiah\r\nO’Brien of Machias, Maine.” Owen Sullivan, the father of Gen. John\r\nSullivan and of James, Governor of Massachusetts, arrived at Boston,\r\n1723, and settled in Berwick, Maine, about 1730. Being of an excellent\r\neducation, he was a teacher in Berwick, Maine, and Somersworth, N. H.\r\nSeveral of the highest grade families of Massachusetts are descendant\r\nfrom Owen Sullivan.\r\n\r\nThe Irish have always been an upbuilding part of the population in New\r\nYork. In O’Callaghan’s “Documentary History of New York,” as shown by M.\r\nJ. O’Brien,[13] are found men named Gill, Barrett, and Ferris, settlers\r\nand Indian fighters in New Netherlands in 1657, and in 1673 Patrick\r\nDowdall, John Fitzgerald, Benjamin Cooley, Thomas Basset, L. Collins,\r\nand Thomas Guinn were enrolled in the militia.\r\n\r\nIn the census of the City of New York in 1703, appear such names as\r\nMooney, Dooley, Walsh, Carroll, Dauly, Corbett, Coleman, Curre, Kenne,\r\nGilley, Gurney, Mogan, Buckley, etc., all with an Irish ring. In 1733\r\nmany others of clearly Irish origin are mentioned. In the muster roll of\r\nthe militia of New York City in 1737, are such Irish names as Welsh,\r\nMcDowell, Ryan, Mooney, Hayes, Donlon, Gill, Murfry, Magee, Kelly,\r\nSutton, Farley, Sullivan, McMullen, O’Brien, etc.\r\n\r\nJohn Anderson of Dublin was high in the affection of the old Dutch\r\nsettlers of Beverwycks, now Albany, as early as 1645, as shown by\r\nDanaher in “Early Irish in old Albany,” N. Y., 1903. He is mentioned in\r\nthe old Dutch records: “Jans Andriessen de Iersman van Dublingh,” and as\r\nan instance of his popularity he is affectionately referred to as Jantie\r\nor Jantien, meaning Johnnie or little Johnnie. As shown by the same\r\nwriter, many Irishmen were early prominent in Albany.\r\n\r\nThomas Dongan, the son of an Irish baronet, governed New York in 1683.\r\nDuring his administration he did much to encourage education. He was a\r\nCatholic, tolerant of all forms of religion. In 1687 he promulgated the\r\n“Declaration of Indulgence,” which authorized public worship by any sect\r\nand abolished all religious qualifications for office.\r\n\r\nIn a work entitled “Names of Persons for whom Marriage Licenses were\r\nIssued by the Secretary of the State of New York previously to 1784,”\r\ncompiled by Gideon J. Tucker (when Secretary of State), page after page\r\nlooks more like a record of the province of Munster than of the province\r\nof New York. “It is quarto volume,” says O’Brien, “printed in small type\r\nand there are eleven pages devoted to persons whose names commence with\r\nMac and three to the O’s. Nearly every name common to Ireland is here\r\nrepresented.”\r\n\r\nBetween 1600 to 1775, many Irishmen were teaching in the Colonies. Of\r\nthese I may mention a few. In 1640, William Collins in New Haven; Peter\r\nPelham, in Boston in 1734. Robert Alexander is justly regarded as the\r\nfounder of Washington and Lee University; Rev. Francis Allison of\r\nDonegal, Ireland, came to America in 1735. In 1752 he took charge of an\r\neducational institute in Philadelphia and became vice provost and\r\nprofessor of moral philosophy in the College of Pennsylvania in 1755.\r\nRev. Samuel Finley, native of Armagh, Ireland, was president of the\r\nCollege of New Jersey in 1761. Michael Walsh came to America in 1792. He\r\nwas a teacher in an academy at Marblehead, Mass. Among his pupils was\r\nJoseph Storey of the United States Supreme Court. Harvard conferred a\r\ndegree upon him. In 1737, John Sullivan taught school at Somersworth, N.\r\nH. William Donovan, an Irish schoolmaster, kept a grammar school in the\r\ntown of Weare, N. H., in 1773. Humphrey Sullivan was a school teacher of\r\nExeter, N. H. Darby Kelly taught school in New Hampshire, etc. Bishop\r\nBerkeley, author of “Westward the Star of Empire takes its course,” came\r\nfrom Kilkenny to Newport, R. I., in 1729. He donated to Yale College an\r\nexcellent collection of books.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the revolutionary era, the whole Irish race threw its\r\nweight into the colonial scale. The Irish Commons, according to T.\r\nD’Arcy McGee in “The Irish Settlers in America,” refused to vote\r\nforty-five thousand dollars for the war. The Irish in England, headed by\r\nBurke, Barrè, and Sheridan, spoke and wrote openly in defense of\r\nAmerica. The Irish in France were equally zealous. Counts MacMahon,\r\nDillon, Colonel Roche-Fermoy, General Conway, etc., held themselves\r\nready to volunteer into the service of America and afterwards at the\r\ndesire of the American agent in Paris did so.\r\n\r\nJohn Barry was the first Commodore of the American Navy. He was in many\r\nactions and was always successful. He has been called by naval writers\r\n“The father of the American Navy.” The first prize carried into the\r\nUnited States was a British ship captured by Captain O’Brien and brought\r\ninto Marblehead.\r\n\r\nCharles Thompson, an Irishman, was secretary to the first Continental\r\nCongress. He wrote out the Declaration of Independence from Jefferson’s\r\ndraft. Mr. John Dunlap, a native of Strabane, Ireland, issued in 1771\r\nthe Pennsylvania Packet, the first daily paper published in America. He\r\nwas printer to the Convention of 1774 and to the first Congress, and was\r\nthe first who printed the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nNine of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were of Irish\r\norigin: Secretary Thompson, Thornton for New Hampshire, James Smith for\r\nPennsylvania, George Taylor, Pennsylvania; George Read, Delaware;\r\nCharles Carroll, of Carrollton, Maryland; Thomas Lynch, of South\r\nCarolina; Thomas McKean, a signer for Pennsylvania; Edward Rutledge, of\r\nSouth Carolina. Six of the thirty-six delegates to the Convention for\r\nascertaining the Constitution were Irish: Read, McKean, John Rutledge,\r\nPierce Butler, of South Carolina, Daniel Carroll and Thomas Fitzsimmons.\r\nThe site of Washington is partly on the farm of Daniel Carroll, a cousin\r\nof Charles, the signer, and was presented to Washington by him.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Continental Army it may be said that Mr. George\r\nWashington Parke Custis, the adopted son of Washington, says in his\r\nPersonal Recollections, that Ireland contributed to the Continental Army\r\none hundred to one of any nation before the coming of the French. Among\r\nthe French, as is well known, there were many Irish. Others have put the\r\nnumber of Irish in Washington’s army as high as fifty per cent. Since I\r\nhave not been able to get original records regarding the Irish in the\r\nRevolutionary army I shall leave the question with the statement,\r\nsupported by fairly wide reading on the subject, that to put it\r\nconservatively a very large number of the soldiers were Irish, or of\r\nIrish origin, as were many of the officers. The question of the Irish,\r\ncomposition of the army of the Revolution is being considered and an\r\ninvestigation of the muster rolls is being made by one of our members,\r\nso that in the near future the Irish contribution in this regard will\r\nreceive an unquestionable verification.\r\n\r\nThe Friendly Sons of St. Patrick was founded at Philadelphia in 1771,\r\nwhere Catholic, Presbyterian, Quaker, and Episcopalian were united like\r\na band of brothers. It was composed of the most active and influential\r\nmen. The devotion of its members to the cause of freedom was\r\nacknowledged by Washington in a letter to the President of the Society\r\nwhere he described the Society as “distinguished for the firmness of its\r\nmembers to the glorious cause in which we are embarked.” Of the Society\r\nseven were generals in the Revolutionary army. Wayne, Stewart, William\r\nThompson, Knox, Irvine, Hand, and Moylan, the latter being the first\r\nPresident of the Society. This Society rendered material assistance to\r\nthe necessities of the army. At a time when everything depended on a\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war it was found impossible to arouse the\r\npublic spirit of the Americans. In this emergency was conceived and\r\ncarried into operation the plan of the Bank of Pennsylvania, established\r\nfor supplying the army of the United States with provisions for two\r\nmonths. Ninety-three individuals and firms subscribed and the amount\r\nrealized was three hundred thousand pounds. Of this twenty-seven members\r\nof the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick subscribed one hundred and three\r\nthousand five hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nJohn Sullivan and John Langdon, in 1774, seized the military stores at\r\nFort William and Mary at the entrance of the Harbor of Portsmouth, New\r\nHampshire, and thus enabled the so-called rebels to fight the battle of\r\nBunker Hill.\r\n\r\nRichard Montgomery, who was born in the County of Donegal, Ireland, was\r\nthe first general of the Continental Army to fall.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident, even from the present surface survey of the part\r\nplayed by the Irish early in our history, that the Irish took a\r\nprominent part in the settlement of the original thirteen colonies. It\r\nseems strange, but yet it is true, that there is a paucity of\r\nrecognition of the splendid services of the Irish emigrant on the part\r\nof some historians. Irish may be met with, however, everywhere in the\r\nearly records. By hardy pluck and upbuilding, energy and sterling\r\npersonality they made their way even in the face of prejudice and\r\nbigotry which were occasionally met with.\r\n\r\nAt the present day men of the Irish race and Irish ancestry are at the\r\nforefront in many lines of human endeavor, as might easily be shown by\r\nthe quotation of names and achievements. I feel that in this glorious\r\nland of promise we have our eyes on the ideal and are ever improving,\r\never growing, doing our duty as we go, and leaving the world better, not\r\nonly by deeds done and tasks performed, but better still by the cheering\r\nword and hearty sympathy, by the shedding of radiant happiness and\r\nbuoyancy of spirit about us as the Irishman has been wont to do in all\r\ntimes and in all climes. We Americans of Irish descent can hold our\r\nheads high in the spirit of things done, in the fairness of our natures\r\nand the purity of our motives, seeking pure justice and asking but the\r\nfavors that in all charity we give to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE IRISH IN THE EARLY DAYS OF ST. LOUIS.\r\n\r\n             BY REV. CORNELIUS F. O’LEARY OF WELLSTON, MO.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Quae regio in terris nostri non plena laboris?_”\r\n\r\nIf our Mantuan bard could have looked into the not very distant future\r\nhe would have beheld a people immeasurably more cosmopolitan than the\r\nTrojans, and infinitely more deserving of the above proud boast. Having\r\nin mind the scattered children of the Gael, could he not ask with\r\ngreater truth: “What land on earth has not borne witness to our toil?”\r\n\r\nWho has not heard of the military adventures of the ancient Gael\r\npursuing his conquering march to the very walls of Rome and dictating to\r\nits proud citizens humiliating terms of surrender? It was on one of\r\nthese occasions that a Roman general complained of the severity of the\r\nfine when the intrepid Gael added to the scale by placing thereon his\r\nsword, uttering the _Vae Victis_ of the Conqueror.\r\n\r\nAbandoning the course of horrid war, which is hell let loose, the men of\r\nErin turned their minds and hearts to Christianity. The land became\r\ndotted over with churches and monasteries until the very place became\r\nReligion. Then a beautiful chapter opens to us—the exodus of Irish\r\nmissionaries to foreign lands—to England and Scotland, to Germany and\r\nFrance, to Belgium and even Italy, in allusion to which Darcy McGee\r\nremarks that the sun rises in the West and sets in the East—“Ireland\r\nenlightens Rome by the light derived from Rome”—\r\n\r\n                  But the flight is far too long;\r\n                  Weak the wings of worldly song;\r\n                  David’s muse alone could rise\r\n                  To a theme of such emprise\r\n                  As to give in long array\r\n                  Those who in that happiest day\r\n                  Bore on faith’s bright flag unfurl’d\r\n                  Erin’s name throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThen came a dark night which brooded over the land, and Erin’s sons were\r\nforced to emigrate to France and Spain and finally to America, that\r\nGreater Island, by which name she was known ten centuries ago.\r\n\r\nTo pursue the history of the Irish in America is the pleasing and\r\nfruitful task set before the members of this grand society, and so I\r\nhope I am in harmony with its spirit and aim if I essay to trace the\r\nfootsteps of the Irish in the early days of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of Paris 1762 New Orleans and Upper Louisiana became the\r\nproperty of Spain. The Kings of that country sent Antonio de Ulloa,\r\nViceroy of Louisiana, to establish Spanish authority here in 1767. The\r\nFrench did not at first take kindly to Spanish domination, and so the\r\ngentle Ulloa is ignominiously expelled from New Orleans. Spain, in its\r\nanger, turned to an Irish officer in its military service, Count\r\nAlexander O’Reilly, who soon brought the French of Louisiana to see the\r\nfolly of resistance. Count O’Reilly was born at Baltrassna, Co. Meath,\r\nIreland, A. D. 1722. He had seen much service in European wars, chiefly\r\nunder the flag of Spain. The following list of his titles shows the\r\nprominence he attained in military life: Don Alexander O’Reilly,\r\nCommander of Benfayon of the Order of Alcantara; Lieutenant-General of\r\nthe armies of His Most Catholic Majesty, Inspector General of Infantry,\r\nand by Commission Governor and Captain-General of the Province of\r\nLouisiana. Promoted to be Field Marshal, he was subsequently sent to\r\nHavana, which he newly fortified and strengthened, and later was sent in\r\nJune, 1768, to recover Louisiana. Though never having set foot in St.\r\nLouis, he is credited with having outlined its governmental policy.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1804, when the formal transfer of Louisiana occurred, we\r\nfind mention of John Mullanphy’s arrival in the village of St. Louis.\r\nBorn in 1758 near Enniskillen, Co. Fermanaugh, Ireland, John Mullanphy\r\nentered the Irish Brigade in the service of France at the age of twenty.\r\nAt its dispersion, on the imprisonment of Louis XVI, Lieutenant\r\nMullanphy returned to Ireland, and in 1789 married Miss Elizabeth Brown.\r\nThree years after this Mr. and Mrs. Mullanphy, with one child, sailed\r\nfor America, landing in Philadelphia, which became their home for a\r\ntime. They next resided in Baltimore, where they formed the acquaintance\r\nof Rev. John Carroll, afterwards the first bishop of America, between\r\nwhom a strong friendship took root. Remembering the lines of Berkeley,\r\n“Westward the star of Empire takes its way,” our citizen of the world\r\nturned towards Kentucky, where he established his home in 1798. While\r\nhere his home in Frankfort became the stopping place of the early\r\nCatholic Missionary, and the temporary chapel of the scattered children\r\nof the Church. In 1804 Mr. Gratiot coming to Frankfort, his acquaintance\r\nwith Mr. Mullanphy grew into closest friendship, which led our hero to\r\nmove to St. Louis, where he was appointed Justice of the Peace. Here\r\nfortune smiled upon him, but he was not the man whom riches could\r\ncorrupt. He made to himself friends of the Mammon of Iniquity, and so\r\nfilled his life with noble deeds. In 1827 he settled upon the Ladies of\r\nthe Sacred Heart twenty-four arpents of land, adjoining the village,\r\ntoday worth millions, on which was a brick house, and gave them ready\r\nmoney for its necessary furnishings. The condition of this bequest was\r\nthat the Sisters should care for and educate in perpetuity twenty young\r\norphan girls. Mr. Mullanphy assisted in establishing an orphan home for\r\nboys. He likewise founded a home for aged and destitute widows, and,\r\nassisted by Bishop Rosati, brought out the Sisters of Charity—the\r\nspiritual daughters of St. Vincent de Paul—to take charge of a hospital,\r\nthe first of its kind in St. Louis, which is now called by his name.\r\nBesides his never-failing daily charities, he in times of scarcity gave\r\nsums of money to the bakers to furnish bread to the hungry poor, and\r\nwhen the cholera was raging employed a young physician, Dr. Henry, to\r\nvisit the sick throughout the surrounding country. Mr. Mullanphy died in\r\nSt. Louis in 1833. His only surviving son, Bryan, was also remarkable\r\nfor his great charities. In November the 14th, 1845, Judge Bryan\r\nMullanphy was chairman of the Committee of Catholic gentlemen who\r\nfounded the first conference of the St. Vincent de Paul society in the\r\nNew World. He also established an immense fund for the relief of\r\nemigrants on their way to settle in the West.\r\n\r\nThe next Irishman who figured prominently in the early history of St.\r\nLouis was Mr. Jeremiah Connor. He came to St. Louis in 1805. He was the\r\nthird sheriff of that city, appointed by Governor Wilkinson in 1806,\r\nserving as such for four years and acting also as collector and\r\ntreasurer. He laid out Washington Avenue, one of the finest streets of\r\nthe city, through the center of his private property, which he\r\ngenerously relinquished to the city without consideration. When Bishops\r\nFlaget and Dubourg came to St. Louis in 1818, the latter to establish\r\nhis Episcopal residence there, Jeremiah Connor donated a thousand\r\ndollars towards his reception. Later he gave the bishop the site\r\nafterwards occupied by the Jesuit Church and College, known as the St.\r\nLouis University.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. ZENAS W. BLISS.\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-Governor of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n  A New Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother son of the Emerald Isle, a man of ability and prominence, was\r\nJoseph Charless, Sr., who was born in Westmeath in 1772. Being\r\nimplicated in the Irish rebellion in 1795, he fled to France and thence\r\nto America in 1796. After a few years’ stay in Philadelphia he removed\r\nto Louisville, Ky. He came to St. Louis in 1808, where he established\r\nthe first newspaper west of the Mississippi River—the _Missouri\r\nGazette_, the name being afterwards changed to _Missouri Republican_\r\nwhen under the management of his son Edward in 1822. It continues to\r\nthis day under the name of the _St. Louis Republic_.\r\n\r\nAlexander McNair, born in Pennsylvania of Irish parents, was the fourth\r\nsheriff in St. Louis, succeeding Jeremiah Connor in that office. During\r\nthe war of 1812 he raised a company of Mounted Rangers of which he was\r\nelected the captain. In 1816, when Congress established a land office\r\nfor the St. Louis district, he was appointed by President Madison the\r\nfirst register of the same, and held office four years until he was\r\nelected, in 1820, the first governor of the state.\r\n\r\nQuite a large number of Irish settlers came to St. Louis, rowing their\r\nown boat down from Pittsburg, and reaching St. Louis early in 1809. The\r\nleaders were John McKnight and Thomas Brady, who had formed a\r\nco-partnership in the east. They opened a store at once, and being\r\nenterprising, intelligent men, the house of McKnight & Brady was not\r\nlong in acquiring prominence, and soon became extensively known for its\r\nenterprise and public spirit. In 1816 they erected a double brick house\r\nof two stories, which was opened as the Washington Hall—the seventh\r\nbrick house in St. Louis, and the first built for a hotel, in which, on\r\nthe twenty-second of February, 1817, the first observance of\r\nWashington’s birthday, west of the Mississippi, took place by a public\r\ndinner presided over by Gov. William Clark, brother of Gen. George\r\nRodger Clark, styled the Hannibal of the Revolution, who were of Irish\r\ndescent. Mr. Brady died October, 1821. The Rt. Rev. Bishop Dubourg\r\nofficiated at the funeral obsequies. Mr. Brady’s father-in-law was John\r\nRice Jones, then chief justice of the Supreme Court of the state.\r\n\r\nWe may form an idea of the strength of the Irish contingent in early\r\nhistory when we read of the following annals: 1818, Feb. 9—Erin\r\nBenevolent Society. A meeting of Irishmen to form a benevolent society\r\nwas held at the house of Jeremiah Connor, Thomas Brady, Chairman, and\r\nThomas Hanly, secretary. A committee of five: Jeremiah Connor, James\r\nMcGunnegle, John Mullanphy, Alexander Blackwill and Arthur McGinnis,\r\nwere appointed to frame resolutions. Adjourned to meet Tuesday, 24th\r\ninst., at 10 o’clock a. m., at the house of Thomas Brady.\r\n\r\n1819, October 10—At meeting of Irish citizens held at the house of\r\nJeremiah Connor at which he presided, and James Nagle, Esq., acted as\r\nsecretary, adopted a constitution for the Erin Benevolent Society and\r\nadjourned to Thursday 21.\r\n\r\nOctober 21—Met pursuant to adjournment and proceeded to the election:\r\nJeremiah Connor, president; Thomas Hanly, vice-president; Hugh Ranken,\r\ntreasurer; Laurence Ryan, secretary; Thomas English, James Timon, Robert\r\nN. Catherwood, Joseph Charles and Hugh O’Neil, standing committee; and\r\nJohn Timon, Robert Ranken and Francis Rochford, visiting committee.\r\n\r\n1820, March 17—The first observance of the day in St. Louis by a\r\nprocession of the society and a dinner at which a number of toasts and\r\nsentiments were drunk.\r\n\r\nAnother historic character of Irish birth was Col. Luke E. Lawless, who\r\ncame to St. Louis in 1816. He was born in Dublin in 1781. He was called\r\nto the bar in 1805. In 1810 he passed over to France and entered the\r\nFrench military service under his uncle, General William Lawless. He was\r\nappointed military secretary to General Clark—Duc of Feltre,—and\r\npromoted to a colonelcy. On the return of Napoleon from Elba he read the\r\naddress of congratulation from his regiment to the Emperor. After the\r\nfinal defeat of Napoleon, in 1815, he came to the United States, and\r\nadopted his former profession of law. Governor Dunklin appointed him\r\nJudge of the circuit of St. Louis. He died in 1846.\r\n\r\nAnother honored name of the early days is that of Charles Chambers, who\r\nwas born in Dublin, in 1784. His father, John Chambers, was one of the\r\noldest stationers and publishers of that city. He was a member of the\r\nSociety of United Irishmen, and was arrested in that memorable year,\r\n1798. He accompanied to New York, Thomas Addis Emmet, Dr. McNevin and\r\nDr. Cummings. Charles Chambers came to New York in 1803. In 1817 he\r\nmarried Jane, the third daughter of John Mullanphy. We find him in St.\r\nLouis in the spring of 1819.\r\n\r\nThe Ranken brothers, Hugh, Robert and David, were born in Londonderry,\r\nIreland. They emigrated to America, remaining in Philadelphia for some\r\ntime. We find two of the brothers engaged in business as early as 1819,\r\nthe third brother, David, arriving as late as 1850. They had been very\r\nsuccessful in business.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 we find Capt. James McGunegle, a member and one of the founders\r\nof the Erin Benevolent Society, appointed Deputy Quartermaster-General\r\nfor St. Louis. He purchased the Territorial Bank of St. Louis, which he\r\nheld until his death, in 1822. He was buried with military honors by the\r\nSt. Louis Guards.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there came to America from gallant Tipperary a lad of\r\ntwenty, named Edward Walsh, Sr. He came to Missouri, where he soon made\r\nhis mark as a man of surpassing ability and indomitable courage. He\r\nturned his attention to many of the great utilities of this progressive\r\nage—from the mining industry to the construction of great lines of\r\nrailroads, and from street car projects to the banking business. It may\r\nbe truly said of him that he was a vital force in the life and\r\ndevelopment of St. Louis and entitled to be numbered among the city’s\r\nfounders and promoters. He left a family of four sons and two daughters,\r\nwho added to the lustre of his name.\r\n\r\nJames Tomon came to St. Louis in 1819. He was a man of superior\r\ncharacter. His eldest son, John, became the much beloved bishop of\r\nBuffalo, N. Y.\r\n\r\nDr. James O’Fallen, born in Athlone, Ireland, served as a surgeon in the\r\nContinental Army under Washington. His wife was Frances Clark, the\r\nyoungest sister of General George Rodger and William. Dr. O’Fallen died\r\nin Louisville in 1793, leaving two sons, John and Benjamin. In 1811,\r\nJohn O’Fallen, then twenty years of age, fought under Col. Davies at the\r\nbattle of Tippecanoe, where he was severely wounded. While connected\r\nwith the army he won much distinction. He settled in St. Louis, of which\r\nhe became one of her most prominent and public-spirited citizens. He\r\ndied in 1865.\r\n\r\nThe Morrison brothers were among the most noted of the early Americans\r\nof our territorial days, remarks Billon. They were of Irish origin and\r\nsettled in and around St. Louis, and even at the present day their\r\ndescendants are men of influence in Missouri and Illinois.\r\n\r\nWe find a Patrick Walsh, from the Town of Sligo, in St. Louis in 1820.\r\nHaving been a merchant, he was commissioned by the governor a justice of\r\nthe peace for the Township of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nPatrick Dillon, from Londonderry, came to the United States in 1809. We\r\nfind him engaged in the mercantile business in St. Louis as early as\r\n1817. He laid out several additions to St. Louis, and one of the streets\r\nis named in his honor.\r\n\r\nPatrick K. Dowling, a Waterford man, came to St. Louis in 1817. One of\r\nhis sons, Richard, who died not many years ago, was a very interesting\r\npersonage. He possessed a rich fund of historical reminiscences.\r\n\r\nThomas Hanley, who was the first secretary of the Irish Benevolent\r\nSociety, came to St. Louis in 1816. He was a merchant.\r\n\r\nJohn Finney and his family came to St. Louis about the year 1818. He and\r\nhis sons acquired prominence and position in social and mercantile life.\r\n\r\nArthur McGinnes, born in County Antrim, Ireland, came to St. Louis in\r\nthe year 1818. He was a young lawyer of considerable ability and force\r\nof character. He pushed his way to the front, attaining much social\r\nprominence. He removed to Washington, D. C., about the year 1840, where\r\nhe continued to reside until his death, in 1848.\r\n\r\nWilliam Higgins came with his wife and family from Ireland to St. Louis\r\nin 1820. His youngest daughter, Winifred, married a Mr. Patterson. She\r\nbecame noted in later years for her princely gifts to charity. She\r\ndeserves to have her name perpetuated in marble and bronze.\r\n\r\nJames Nagle and Hugh Johnson came to St. Louis in 1820. “They were two\r\nyoung Irishmen of good education,” remarks our annalist. They carried on\r\na successful mercantile business for many years. After the death of Mr.\r\nJohnson, in 1825, Mr. Nagle entered into the practice of law.\r\n\r\nAnd thus did the exiled children of Erin come to this Key City of the\r\nMississippi Valley to grace every sphere of life. There is one sphere to\r\nwhich I have not alluded—that of the sanctuary. And here let me mention\r\nthe illustrious name of Most Rev. Peter Richard Kenrick, who was born in\r\nDublin in 1806, ordained for that diocese in 1832, and soon changed the\r\nfield of his labors for America at the earnest solicitation of his\r\nillustrious brother, Francis Patrick, Archbishop of Philadelphia. Bishop\r\nRosati of St. Louis, desiring a coadjutor, his choice fell on this\r\nbrilliant young Irish priest. He was consecrated coadjutor-bishop of St.\r\nLouis in 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n DANIEL MORGAN—ABLE TRIBUTE TO THE MOST UNIQUE FIGURE IN THE ANNALS OF\r\n                        AMERICAN COMMONWEALTHS.\r\n\r\n _An address delivered before the Society, copy for which was received\r\n         too late for publication in Vol. VIII of the Journal._\r\n\r\n                BY HON. JOSEPH T. LAWLESS, NORFOLK, VA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Fellow Members_:\r\n\r\n  By the grace of your invitation, I have the honor of addressing this\r\n  Society a second time. With the invitation was coupled the admonition\r\n  that I should devote myself to the subject which our distinguished\r\n  President has just announced. Deeply distrusting my ability to\r\n  discharge the commission to your entertainment and within the\r\n  limitation of time the occasion prescribes, but taking courage from\r\n  your desire to have recorded the facts of unwritten history as they\r\n  affect the objects of this organization, and relying upon your\r\n  patience to hear, though your interest should wane, I have come\r\n  tonight in obedience to your summons to speak of the most unique\r\n  figure in the annals of American Commonwealths. The place of his birth\r\n  unknown even to himself—his parentage wrapped in an oblivion which he\r\n  steadfastly refused to penetrate—a farm laborer in the Valley of\r\n  Virginia in 1755—a teamster in the British army in the French and\r\n  Indian war—he advanced without the aid of adventitious circumstances\r\n  to the command of an army of his compatriots and fought and won at the\r\n  Cowpens the battle which made possible the triumph at Yorktown!\r\n\r\n  All this, indeed, did Daniel Morgan. But he did more. He conquered his\r\n  own weaknesses, and scorned the allurements of unworthy preferments.\r\n  He overcame the excesses of youthful appetite; he flouted the\r\n  proffered temptations of a commission in the royal army of Great\r\n  Britain while a ragged prisoner of war amidst the snows of Quebec; and\r\n  in the hour of his subsequent glory on the field at Saratoga, he\r\n  disdained the persuasions of Gates to join the “Conway Cabal” and\r\n  remained loyal to Washington and to the liberties of his country.\r\n\r\n  With his lineage unknown, his birthplace unestablished, his advent\r\n  unheralded, and his history but sparsely written, no man can speak\r\n  with certainty of the race from which he sprung. But if there be aught\r\n  distinctive in racial characteristics; or aught indicative in that\r\n  accent of human speech which makes the Irish brogue sound as music on\r\n  the ear, Daniel Morgan was of that race which has ennobled Celtic\r\n  history, and the lullaby which first soothed him into sleeping was the\r\n  crooning of a mother’s voice that spake the Irish tongue. But, my\r\n  countrymen, whatever his lineage and wherever the place of his birth,\r\n  tonight, on the one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary of his\r\n  greatest battle, when we have assembled in New York’s banquet hall to\r\n  honor his memory and to make better known a renown which should be as\r\n  firmly established as the liberties of his country, we may well pause\r\n  to trace the course of those wonderful activities which have no\r\n  parallel in Revolutionary lore.\r\n\r\n  The earliest, and perhaps his sole biographer, James Graham, declares\r\n  he was of Welsh extraction, and that he went to Virginia from the\r\n  banks of the Delaware. This declaration is based on a manuscript\r\n  prepared for the biographer by Dr. William Hall, of Winchester, who\r\n  knew General Morgan in his lifetime and attended his bedside during\r\n  his last illness. The uniform refusal of Morgan to discuss his\r\n  parentage and the resultant uncertainty which surrounds his racial\r\n  extraction, entitle such a statement on the part of a person who was\r\n  his friend in life to consideration and respect. But I submit a\r\n  statement of another person who knew him during life to substantiate\r\n  the belief which exists in Virginia that he was of Irish blood.\r\n\r\n  The grandmother of Colonel Charles Triplett O’Ferrall, a late Governor\r\n  of that Commonwealth, lived near and knew Daniel Morgan. During a\r\n  close association at Richmond, Governor O’Ferrall frequently told me\r\n  anecdotes of him which he learned from the lips of his grandmother,\r\n  who in her early life saw much of Morgan and was present at his\r\n  funeral. In reciting some of these anecdotes the Governor would\r\n  imitate the Irish brogue which appeared to distinguish the accent of\r\n  Morgan. Born within a few miles of Morgan’s home, O’Ferrall lived in\r\n  the Valley all his life and for twelve years represented that District\r\n  in the House of Representatives of the United States. Three times in\r\n  that body he introduced a bill having for its object the erection of a\r\n  monument to mark the grave of Morgan. No citizen gave more thought to\r\n  the personality of the man and his career as a soldier than did\r\n  Governor O’Ferrall. In his published memoirs he closes the last\r\n  chapter with a tribute to him and expresses the hope that some\r\n  successor in Congress from the Valley District will be able to\r\n  persuade Congress to mark his lowly grave. “I had set my heart on its\r\n  passage,” he says, on page 358; “every emotion of my soul was aroused\r\n  in its behalf. I had carefully studied the hero’s life and character\r\n  and it read like a romance to me.” Concerning Morgan’s brogue, he\r\n  could not have been misinformed by his grandmother. _Res ipsa\r\n  loquitur._ Himself of Irish extraction and as game a cavalryman as\r\n  ever drew a blade, who can doubt that it was because of the blood that\r\n  ran in Morgan’s veins, scarcely less than his services to his country,\r\n  that impelled O’Ferrall to so interest himself in his career?\r\n\r\n  When about the age of seventeen, in the year 1753, a tall, raw-boned\r\n  boy, calling himself Daniel Morgan, “turned up” near the village of\r\n  Winchester in Virginia. There was nothing about him to excite the good\r\n  opinion of those frontiersmen, except his willingness to work. He had\r\n  scant acquaintance with the three R’s. His writing was barely legible;\r\n  his reading, painful to everybody who heard—especially to himself; his\r\n  knowledge of the simplest principles of arithmetic, was small; his\r\n  manners were rude; and his conversation so unpolished as to class him\r\n  with the humblest order of men. The only occupation he understood was\r\n  that of a land-grubber and rail-splitter, and it was at these hard\r\n  tasks that he sought employment. He found it. And such was his\r\n  strength and his industry that no man engaged Daniel Morgan to clear a\r\n  piece of new land or to split white-oak rails for a snake-fence and\r\n  ever regretted his contract! Within a year he became a wagoner for\r\n  Nathaniel Burwell, Esquire. In a little more than two years his\r\n  industry and thrift enabled him to purchase a wagon and team of his\r\n  own; and then—a forerunner of the Wells Fargo—he established an\r\n  express between the Valley and points beyond the Blue Ridge, east of\r\n  the Range.\r\n\r\n  As his fortunes improved, there came improvement in his mind. His\r\n  manners, too, changed. The raw-boned boy of seventeen had developed\r\n  into the man of twenty-one, and with the development came a reputation\r\n  for great physical strength and a courage that was dauntless—great\r\n  virtues, always, on the frontier. With these qualities he coupled a\r\n  natural wit, a quick intelligence, a manliness, and a frankness of\r\n  manner which won the admiration of his sturdy neighbors.\r\n\r\n  When Braddock landed his army on the upper banks of the Potomac to\r\n  make good the claim of his sovereign to the fertile region west of the\r\n  Alleghanies, Morgan became a teamster with the ill-fated soldiers and\r\n  accompanied the baggage train of the Second Division. In 1756 he was\r\n  sent to Fort Chiswell with a wagon-load of supplies. It was while at\r\n  this post that he received the terrible beating on his bare back which\r\n  would have cost a less hardy man his life. A British lieutenant\r\n  insulted him by striking him with the flat of his sword and was\r\n  immediately stretched senseless on the ground by a blow from the\r\n  teamster’s fist. A drum-head courtmartial sentenced him to receive\r\n  five hundred lashes. He was forthwith stripped and tied to a white-oak\r\n  tree. At the end of the castigation his flesh hung in tags. But his\r\n  spirit was unbroken and King George was never forgiven for the cruelty\r\n  his soldiers then inflicted.\r\n\r\n  When he arrived at about the age of twenty-three, he was a strikingly\r\n  handsome man. In height, he was upward of six feet; his frame was\r\n  massive and symmetrical; and, without carrying an ounce of superfluous\r\n  flesh, his weight was two hundred pounds. But his conduct was not\r\n  exemplary. He became at this time a trencherman of distinction. Yet so\r\n  powerful was his constitution he was able to bear excess of liquor\r\n  without becoming entirely under its influence. As a card player, he\r\n  was as skillful as the most skillful, and he used his talent to add to\r\n  his estate. So great was his prowess at fisticuffs and so constant his\r\n  engagements thereat, that the little town of Berryville in the County\r\n  of Clarke, where these combats were always held, is called\r\n  “Battletown” to this day by the older residents of the Valley.\r\n\r\n  This, indeed, was the most unpromising time of Daniel Morgan’s life.\r\n  To most of the vices which end in ruin, he was addicted. But, in the\r\n  Providence of God, he was not overwhelmed. Grave faults, indeed, he\r\n  had in plenty; but they appear to have proceeded, not from a depraved\r\n  heart but from the rollicking, devil-may-care nature of a young\r\n  frontiersman. Without parents to advise or friends to admonish, his\r\n  bold wayward spirit was conscious of no restraint when impulse\r\n  impelled it to action. What he needed to round the man was adventurous\r\n  enterprise—dangerous commissions! The dash within him—the spirit of\r\n  command—needed war. And, war came! Like Hotspur, he must have blows\r\n  and “pass them current, too.”\r\n\r\n  First it was “Lord Dunmore’s War” for the protection of the frontier\r\n  against the Indians under Chief Logan and Cornstalk. General Andrew\r\n  Lewis, an Irishman born and thirteen years of age before he left\r\n  Ireland for Virginia, was ordered to raise four regiments in the\r\n  Southwestern counties; and while Lewis was organizing his forces,\r\n  Morgan, now holding a commission by grace of William Nelson, Esquire,\r\n  President of His Majesty’s Council and Commander-in-chief of the\r\n  Colony and Dominion of Virginia, took the field under Major Angus\r\n  McDonald. He became at once an active factor. His splendid judgment,\r\n  his knowledge of woodcraft, his understanding of the Indian character\r\n  and their methods of warfare, his boldness and his courage, soon\r\n  distinguished him among his comrades in arms as a man fit for\r\n  leadership.\r\n\r\n  “Lord Dunmore’s War” ended with the defeat of Cornstalk at Point\r\n  Pleasant and Morgan’s command turned homeward. When they reached the\r\n  mouth of the Hockhocking, those stupendous events which had been\r\n  happening in England and the Colonies during their absence became\r\n  known to these Virginians, fresh from the wilderness. They learned\r\n  that the Parliament of Great Britain had ordered the port of Boston to\r\n  be closed. They were informed that the General Assembly of the mother\r\n  colony had protested against such despotic legislation. They were told\r\n  with solemn voices that representatives of the people were then\r\n  assembled at Philadelphia to consider ways and means to resist the\r\n  encroachments of the crown. And then and there, amidst the solitude of\r\n  that wilderness, far from the outposts of civilization, Daniel Morgan\r\n  and his band of liberty-loving Virginians resolved upon their course.\r\n  “Upon hearing these things,” he wrote in an all-too-inadequate sketch\r\n  of his military services, “we, as an army victorious, formed ourselves\r\n  into a society, pledging our words of honor to each other to assist\r\n  our brethren of Boston in case hostilities should commence.” I need\r\n  not ask you New Englanders tonight how well they kept that pledge!\r\n\r\n  On the 22d day of June, 1775, by a unanimous vote of the Committee of\r\n  Safety of Frederick County, he was appointed to command one of the two\r\n  companies of Riflemen which the Continental Congress had ordered to be\r\n  raised in Virginia. “In less than ten days after the receipt of his\r\n  commission,” says Graham, “he raised a company of ninety-six young,\r\n  hardy woodsmen, full of spirit and enthusiasm and practised marksmen\r\n  with the rifle. John Humphreys, who was killed in the assault on\r\n  Quebec, was his first lieutenant. William Heth, afterwards a Colonel,\r\n  who greatly distinguished himself in the subsequent events of the war,\r\n  was his second lieutenant. His ensign was Charles Porterfield,\r\n  afterwards a Colonel, and an officer who by his many brilliant and\r\n  daring achievements had earned a proud name among the defenders of his\r\n  country, and was rapidly rising to distinction when he fell in the\r\n  bloody field of Camden. A finer body of men than those who composed\r\n  his company are seldom seen. One that rendered better service, or that\r\n  shed a brighter lustre on the arms of their country, never had\r\n  existence.”\r\n\r\n  In twenty-one days, Morgan, at the head of this company, each Rifleman\r\n  wearing a cap with the legend “Liberty or Death,” marched a distance\r\n  of six hundred miles to Boston, and when the roll was called every\r\n  member of the command was present and ready for duty.\r\n\r\n  He was now come for the first time on that broader field of action in\r\n  which he won a renown which will never die. It is not my purpose to\r\n  dwell on the hardships of that extraordinary march into Canada led by\r\n  Arnold. The sufferings endured by the Americans in the midst of the\r\n  snow’s and ice of the Canadian winter are beyond the power of human\r\n  speech to depict. Half-clad, bare of foot or shod only with moccasins,\r\n  half-starving, with their comrades in arms dropping in their weary\r\n  tracks to die—such sufferings could only be endured by men whose\r\n  natural hardihood and love of country could not be overwhelmed by the\r\n  agonies of physical torture. At intervals, some helpless hero would be\r\n  overcome by the hardships of the march and tenderly laid aside to die,\r\n  with a single devoted comrade to hunt for a squirrel or jay or to\r\n  gather wild herbs for his food, the while he watched his expiring\r\n  breath and caught the last whispered message of affection for the\r\n  loved ones at home. Morgan himself was dressed in a costume similar to\r\n  that of an Indian. He wore leggings and a cloth about the middle. His\r\n  thighs were bare and their laceration because of it was painfully\r\n  obvious. But he appeared to be impervious to pain. Judge Henry, who\r\n  was a member of the expedition, in his “Campaign” describes Morgan at\r\n  this time as being “a large, strong-bodied personage”—“with a\r\n  stentorian voice”—“whose appearance gave the idea history has left us\r\n  of Belisarius.” Those high qualifications for command, which became\r\n  more and more distinguished as the war progressed, manifested\r\n  themselves on this occasion. He led the vanguard. And in eight weeks’\r\n  time he penetrated an unexplored wilderness for six hundred miles and\r\n  stood ready with his Riflemen to assault the fortified walls of\r\n  gun-fringed and snow-crowned Quebec.\r\n\r\n  If the fame of Daniel Morgan as one of the most intrepid of soldiers\r\n  depended alone on his conduct at the storming of Quebec, it would live\r\n  as long as the heroic deeds of the Revolution are remembered of men.\r\n  At the height of a tempest in which the blinding snow was driven with\r\n  terrible effect, in the early hours of the first day of the New Year,\r\n  1775, the assault began. Armed with scaling-ladders and spontoons, as\r\n  well as rifles, Morgan’s men, with their captain at their head, were\r\n  first over the walls. With a sublime courage and a voice which rang\r\n  above the roar of the tempest he commanded his men, and they, with a\r\n  devotion as faithful as it was unquestioning, obeyed. Into the heart\r\n  of the town they fought their way. But, alas, the brave fellows were\r\n  not supported. The disastrous results of the assault—the wounding of\r\n  Arnold at its commencement, the death of Montgomery, the brave, while\r\n  leading those sixty heroes from New York, and the capture of Morgan,\r\n  of the lion’s heart—are tales of devotion which every American\r\n  schoolboy knows and which were so extraordinary as to become the\r\n  subject of public eulogy in the Commons of Great Britain. With “the\r\n  flower of the rebel army,” Morgan was “cooped up” in the town. His\r\n  half-starved and poorly clad men were all but frozen in the terrible\r\n  northeast storm. Their eyes could not endure the hail; their faces\r\n  were “hoar with frost” and weird with pendant icicles; their rifles\r\n  were practically useless. Finding himself alone with a few of his men\r\n  and a sprinkling of brave Pennsylvanians, and confronted in a narrow\r\n  street by his massed enemies, he resolved to cut his way through. The\r\n  attempt was madness itself. At last, he stood at bay with his back to\r\n  a wall. With tears streaming down his face, he refused to surrender\r\n  and challenged his enemies to come and take his sword. A hundred\r\n  muskets were levelled at his breast, when several of his men begged\r\n  him to resist no further. Denouncing his enemies as cowards, he\r\n  acquiesced in the importunities of his followers, but refused to\r\n  surrender his sword to any person save a noncombatant priest who\r\n  chanced to be near.\r\n\r\n  The heroism of the Americans in this assault attracted the admiration\r\n  of the world. Frederick, of Prussia, praised Montgomery as a military\r\n  chieftain. In the British Parliament, Barrè, Montgomery’s veteran\r\n  friend and comrade in the war with France which annexed Canada to the\r\n  crown, “wept profusely,” in extolling his virtues and the bravery of\r\n  his men. Edmund Burke pronounced him a hero and his men brave\r\n  patriots. Lord North, in reply for government, cursed the virtues of\r\n  the Americans and denounced them as rebels. “The term rebel,” retorted\r\n  Fox, “is no certain mark of disgrace. The great assertors of liberty,\r\n  the saviors of their country, the benefactors of mankind in all ages\r\n  have been called rebels. We owe the constitution which enables us to\r\n  sit in this house to a rebellion.” And North was silent!\r\n\r\n  It was during his confinement in “The Seminary,” following his\r\n  capture, that Morgan was tempted by the British to desert the cause of\r\n  his country. Had he been made of common clay he might have yielded. He\r\n  was half-naked; the few garments he wore were in tatters; he was a\r\n  thousand miles from home; he was a prisoner of war with no prospect of\r\n  release. But beneath the ragged hunting shirt of this nobleman from\r\n  the Virginia forests beat a heart as full of loyalty as of love for\r\n  his country. The polished and generous Governor-General, Sir Guy\r\n  Carleton, knew of his wonderful courage in the assault. Through the\r\n  mediation of a subordinate, he tendered Morgan in delicate and\r\n  diplomatic language “the commission, rank and emoluments of a colonel”\r\n  in the British Army. “I hope, sir,” was his disdainful reply, “I hope,\r\n  sir, you will never again insult me in my present distressed and\r\n  unfortunate situation by making me offers which plainly imply that you\r\n  think me a scoundrel.”\r\n\r\n  On the 10th day of August, 1776, the prisoners of war in Quebec were\r\n  released on parole, and a month later landed from the transports at\r\n  Elizabethtown Point. General Washington gave Morgan a flattering\r\n  reception. His high qualifications as an officer had become known\r\n  throughout the army, and the Commander-in-chief desired to avail of\r\n  his talents at once. From the Heights of Harlem, on the 20th day of\r\n  September, 1776, General Washington addressed a communication to the\r\n  President of Congress urging the appointment of Morgan to succeed\r\n  Colonel Hugh Stephenson of the Rifle Regiment lately ordered to be\r\n  raised. He stated “his conduct as an officer, in the expedition with\r\n  General Arnold last fall, his intrepid behavior in the assault on\r\n  Quebec, when the brave Montgomery fell, the inflexible attachment he\r\n  professed to our cause during his imprisonment, and which he\r\n  perseveres in,” all entitled him “to the favor of Congress.” After his\r\n  release from his parole, Congress acted on the recommendation and\r\n  Captain Morgan became “a Colonel of the Eleventh Regiment of Virginia\r\n  in the army of the United States.” Before the year 1776 closed he was\r\n  once more in the field of active operations.\r\n\r\n  He was ordered northward with a regiment of his own recruiting to\r\n  check the ravages of the Indians attached to Burgoyne’s army. During\r\n  that ever memorable campaign under Gates, Morgan and his men were in\r\n  the thick of every engagement until the capitulation of the British at\r\n  Saratoga. “Sir, you command the finest regiment in the world,” was\r\n  Burgoyne’s outburst to him when they were introduced after the\r\n  surrender. And in his “Review of the Evidence taken before the House\r\n  of Commons,” in which Burgoyne’s conduct was a subject of\r\n  investigation, in speaking of Morgan’s regiment having driven the\r\n  British light infantry from the field and attacked them in their\r\n  entrenchments, Burgoyne remarks: “If there can be any person who,\r\n  after considering that circumstance and the positive proof of the\r\n  subsequent obstinacy of the attack on the post of Lord Balcarras, and\r\n  various other actions of the day, continue to doubt that the Americans\r\n  possess the _quality_ and _faculty_ of fighting (call it by whatever\r\n  term they please) they are of a prejudice that it would be very absurd\r\n  longer to contend with.”\r\n\r\n  That is honorable testimony from an able adversary of the part Morgan\r\n  bore in those momentous days. And yet the name of Morgan was omitted\r\n  from the official account of the surrender which he did so much to\r\n  compel. The reason was not far to seek and is now well-known.\r\n  Again—this time on a triumphant field—did the innate nobleness, the\r\n  loyalty and love of country of Daniel Morgan overcome the\r\n  blandishments of the tempter and scorn his proffered preferments.\r\n  General Gates sought to persuade the honest woodsman to join him and\r\n  his co-conspirators in the “Conway Cabal,” which had for its object\r\n  the promotion of Gates over Washington. He refused. Had he yielded,\r\n  his name would have blazoned the dispatches announcing the\r\n  capitulation. When Gates had concluded his request, the frank and\r\n  honest soul of Morgan was aflame with indignation. “I have one favor\r\n  to ask of you, sir, which is never to mention that detestable subject\r\n  to me again; for under no other man than Washington as\r\n  commander-in-chief would I ever serve.”\r\n\r\n  Vain was the attempt to ignore the services of Morgan and his regiment\r\n  in the campaign against Burgoyne! The omission of his name by Gates in\r\n  the dispatches should be supplied by the mighty pen of his grateful\r\n  countrymen, and writ large, in letters of gold, upon the imperishable\r\n  annals of the Republic. His enemies paid homage to his gallantry. An\r\n  incident occurred at this time, as related by Lee in his Memoirs,\r\n  which illustrates the resentment of Gates towards Morgan and\r\n  demonstrates how unworthy and undeserved was his malice. Shortly after\r\n  the rejection by Morgan of General Gates’ proposition to join the\r\n  “Conway Cabal,” Gates gave a dinner to the principal officers of\r\n  Burgoyne’s army. The principal officers of the American army were also\r\n  present. But Morgan was not invited. Having occasion to seek an\r\n  interview with General Gates before the entertainment was concluded,\r\n  the British officers, observing the noble mien and soldier-like\r\n  carriage of Morgan and that he wore the uniform of a field officer,\r\n  made inquiries concerning his identity immediately upon his\r\n  withdrawal. When informed that he was Colonel Morgan, of the Rifle\r\n  Regiment, they arose to a man, and overtaking him in the road\r\n  severally introduced themselves and declared their admiration for his\r\n  bravery and skill as a commander.\r\n\r\n  After the surrender, Colonel Morgan, by express command of General\r\n  Washington, marched southward to join him. The commanderin-chief was\r\n  then operating on the Hudson and in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and\r\n  was anxious to avail himself of the remarkable talents of Morgan,\r\n  whose Rangers were now become the _elite_ rifle-corps of the army. To\r\n  follow him in all of his engagements while under the immediate command\r\n  of Washington would prolong this address beyond the limitations which\r\n  patience and the conventions prescribe. No undertaking having for its\r\n  object the success of the American cause was too hazardous, no service\r\n  too difficult for him to perform. It was during this period that\r\n  developed those intimate personal relations between Colonel Morgan and\r\n  General Lafayette which continued through life and which is\r\n  affectionately manifested in the correspondence of the polished\r\n  Marquis with his unaccomplished friend. In a letter from Fishkill,\r\n  November 28, 1778, Lafayette, in thanking Morgan for the friendship\r\n  and good opinion he expressed for him on the eve of his departure for\r\n  France, said: “Both are extremely dear to my heart; and I do assure\r\n  you, my dear sir, that the true regard and esteem and the sincere\r\n  affection you have inspired to me, will last forever.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “Farewell, my dear sir, don’t forget your friend on the other side of\r\n  the great water, and believe me ever,\r\n\r\n                                                “Your affectionate,\r\n                                                            “LAFAYETTE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBut while he was held in the highest esteem by his superior officers and\r\nhad rendered extraordinary services to his country, Congress ignored him\r\nin dispensing its favors and continued to promote over his head men of\r\nsmaller talents who had friends at court. Finally he determined to\r\nresign. Not even the influence of Washington, once his mind had been\r\nformed, was powerful enough to dissuade him from his purpose. Early in\r\nJuly, 1779, he presented a laudatory letter from Washington to Congress\r\nand offered his resignation. It was accepted, and the war-worn hero\r\nmounted his horse and rode homeward to the verdant valley of the\r\nShenandoah. Greatly was his departure regretted in the army. In a letter\r\nto him dated “Haverstraw, Nov. 9, 1779,” General John Neville, then an\r\nofficer in Woodford’s brigade, said: “Then, say they, for old Morgan a\r\nbrigadier, and we would kick the world before us. I am not fond of\r\nflattery; but I assure you, on my word, that no man’s ever leaving the\r\narmy was more regretted than yours, nor no man was ever wished for more\r\nto return.”\r\n\r\nFor fifteen months he remained with his family, a close student of\r\npassing events in the progress of the war. The attention of the British\r\nwas now directed towards the South and Morgan was filled with\r\napprehension by the preparations being made to bring it under British\r\nsubjection. Leading three thousand fresh troops from New York,\r\nCornwallis had arrived near Charleston to take command in that section.\r\nSo rapid and effective were his operations that on the 12th day of May,\r\n1780, when he was ready to assault the town by land and water, General\r\nLincoln signed a capitulation of the city and surrendered his army. By\r\nthe end of June, the British commander was able to report that he had\r\nput an end to all resistance in South Carolina and Georgia; and that in\r\naccordance with his plan of operations, he would after the September\r\nharvest reduce the province of North Carolina, continue his march to the\r\nChesapeake, and from that base conquer the province of Virginia.\r\n\r\nDisregarding the wishes of Washington, Congress on the 13th day of June\r\nunanimously named General Gates, instead of General Greene, to succeed\r\nLincoln in command of the Southern Department. It proved to be one of\r\nthe saddest blunders of the war.\r\n\r\nIn receiving this independent command, Gates was instructed to report\r\ndirectly to Congress and not to the commander-in-chief. He was\r\nauthorized to appoint his own staff-officers; to address himself\r\ndirectly to Virginia and to the States north of it for supplies; and to\r\nengage his army in such manner for the defense of the South as his\r\njudgment alone should approve. Ambitious as Lucifer, and vain by nature,\r\nthis mark of great distinction—bestowed in spite of the known opinion of\r\nWashington concerning its unwisdom—gave Gates unlimited confidence in\r\nhis abilities. Miscalculating the fighting strength of his “grand army,”\r\ntwo thirds of which consisted of raw militia from the various provinces\r\nthat had never been paraded together, he marched against the best\r\ndisciplined troops in the world, led by Cornwallis, at Camden, and\r\nsuffered a defeat which demoralized the entire South, deprived him of\r\nhis command and terminated his military career. “Two thirds of the army\r\nran like a torrent,” he wrote, forgetting to add that he ran with them\r\nand did not quit running until he arrived, ahead of the fleetest of the\r\nfugitives, at Hillsborough, North Carolina, two hundred miles\r\naway—making the distance in the splendid time of three and one half\r\ndays!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAJOR JOHN W. BOURLET.\r\n\r\n  Of Concord, N. H.\r\n\r\n  Many years in charge of the printing and publishing of the volumes of\r\n    the Society.\r\n\r\n  Deceased, January 19, 1910.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, Cornwallis was the most conspicuous figure in the\r\nBritish Army in America. Already “the pride and delight” of Lord George\r\nGermain, his successes vindicated the opinion which that minister\r\nentertained of his military talents, and he was now designed by the\r\nCabinet to supersede Clinton as commander-in-chief—being considered “the\r\none man on whom rested the hopes of the ministry for the successful\r\ntermination of the war.” Proud of this favoritism on the part of the\r\nCabinet and conscious of the hopes and expectations of the King,\r\nCornwallis began preparations for his northward march. Success had\r\nelated him. He believed he would swing from victory unto victory until\r\nhe had brought all of the people south of the Delaware again under the\r\ndominion of the crown.\r\n\r\nHe began the work of subjugation by inaugurating a reign of terror not\r\nexcelled in point of barbarity in the annals of civilized warfare. After\r\nhis victory at Camden, he erected a gibbet, and began the summary and\r\nindiscriminate execution of those among his prisoners who had formerly\r\nreceived their parole. He gave stringent orders to his subordinates to\r\nimprison all who refused to enter the British Army and thus became the\r\ninstrument of their own subjection. The confiscation of property and the\r\ndestruction of life assumed hideous forms. “South Carolina,” says\r\nBancroft, “was writhing under the insolence of an army in which every\r\nsoldier was licensed to pillage, and every officer outlawed peaceful\r\ncitizens at will.” The gold and silver plate and other valuables divided\r\namongst the victors at the fall of Charleston amounted in value to a\r\nmillion and a half dollars, the dividend of a major-general alone being\r\nfour thousand guineas. Cold-blooded assassinations by men holding the\r\nKing’s commission, often in the presence of the wives and children of\r\nthe helpless victims, were frequent. No engagements by capitulation were\r\nrespected. Woodsmen in their rude cabins were suddenly surrounded and\r\nput to death, not because they were in arms against the King, but\r\nbecause they were not in arms for him. The tomahawking in June, 1777, of\r\npoor Jane McRae by one of the two Indians in the British service who\r\nwere escorting her under British protection from Fort Edward, New York,\r\nto her expectant betrothed in the British lines, and who quarreled over\r\nthe reward promised for her safe arrival, found a fitting complement\r\nthree years later in South Carolina when Colonel Tarleton, of His\r\nMajesty’s service, personally beat the wife of a general officer of the\r\nContinental army because of his activity in the cause of his country.\r\nEqualling this villainy, Lord Rawdon, one of Cornwallis’ commanders on\r\nthe Santee, who had found great difficulty in forcing his Irish Regiment\r\nto fight against the American patriots, issued an order dated July 1,\r\n1780, in which he said: “I will give the inhabitants ten guineas for any\r\ndeserter belonging to the volunteers of Ireland and five guineas only if\r\nthey bring him in alive.”\r\n\r\nTo the disgrace of the ministry of Lord North, these practices were not\r\nonly known to but were approved by the Cabinet. Indeed, they met the\r\n“hearty and repeated applause” of those charged with the conduct of the\r\nwar, Germain declaring in orders to Clinton that “no good faith or\r\njustice is to be expected from them and we ought in all our transactions\r\nwith them to act upon that supposition.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the temper of the British and such was the condition of the\r\npeople of South Carolina when Cornwallis moved forward.\r\n\r\nThe army was in three divisions—the main body under Cornwallis, at\r\nCamden; Tarleton’s Legion, at Winnsborough; and the Brigade of\r\nProvincial troops under Major Ferguson, at Post Ninety-Six. It was at\r\nthis time that Morgan again took the field. The defeat of Gates at\r\nCamden had stirred his patriotism to its very depths. In the distress of\r\nhis country he buried all resentment of the ill-treatment he had\r\nreceived from both Gates and the Congress—the hardy warrior again drew\r\nhis sword. And Gates with his pride humbled and his heart filled with\r\nhumility by adversity, desiring to retrieve his fallen fortunes,\r\nresolved upon giving Morgan an independent command. The British began\r\ntheir march in the second week of September—a delightful season in the\r\nsouthern clime, perhaps the loveliest of the year. The earlier cereals\r\nhad yielded to the sickle, and the sheaves, standing like mute sentinels\r\nin the field, had been bound by the reapers. The maize was nearly ripe.\r\nSupplies for the troops were plentiful. Indeed, the proud Cornwallis had\r\nno thought of care for his army that did not dissolve in the kindling\r\nprospect of glory and renown.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of Bancroft, the ablest British partizan officer at that\r\ntime in America was Major Patrick Ferguson, in command of the left\r\ndivision of the army. He was ordered to enlist as he passed northward,\r\nthe young loyalists who had fled to the mountains for security and those\r\nfugitives whose love of plunder would find indulgence and protection\r\nunder the British standard. House-burners and assassins, plunderers and\r\nwrongers of women and children, were massed in his command. But neither\r\nFerguson nor his desperate troops were fated much longer to pillage,\r\nburn and kill. At King’s Mountain, on the 7th day of October, the\r\nbackwoodsmen from the Virginia mountains, the commands of Isaac Shelby\r\nand John Sevier, the men from North Carolina under McDowell and\r\nCleaveland—all by common consent under the command of the redoubtable\r\nVirginian, William Campbell, a brother-in-law of Patrick Henry—every man\r\narmed with his own rifle and riding his own horse, determined to avenge\r\nthe wrongs which they and their kinsmen had suffered at the hands of the\r\nBritish troops. A bloody battle was fought and Ferguson was pierced\r\nthrough the heart. His entire command was captured.\r\n\r\nSix days after this event, on the recommendation of Thomas Jefferson,\r\nGovernor of Virginia, and John Rutledge, the great chief magistrate of\r\nSouth Carolina, Congress appointed Daniel Morgan a Brigadier-General in\r\nthe army of the United States. The news of the death of Ferguson and the\r\nsurrender of his army at King’s Mountain reached Cornwallis on the march\r\nfrom Charlotte to Salisbury. The destruction of one-third of his army,\r\nat a single blow, and the death of his ablest commander were reverses as\r\nstunning as they were unexpected. His fears were at once aroused for the\r\nsafety of the posts in his rear, now being constantly menaced by Marion\r\nand Sumpter.\r\n\r\nHe first halted. Then he retreated. Determining to reinforce his army,\r\nbefore resuming his march, with the three thousand men under General\r\nLeslie at Portsmouth, Virginia, he ordered that officer to join him by\r\nway of Charleston. He recrossed the Catawba and posted himself at\r\nWinnsborough on the 29th day of October, intending to await the coming\r\nof Leslie. On the 4th day of December, 1780, General Nathaniel Greene\r\nsucceeded General Gates in command of the American army in camp at\r\nCharlotte. And now began the series of stirring events which culminated\r\nin the most remarkable and surprising battle of the war and the\r\ndestruction of the second division of Cornwallis’ proud army.\r\n\r\nThe whole American force at this time did not exceed two thousand men,\r\nonly eight hundred of whom were regulars. It was an army almost entirely\r\ndevoid of necessary equipment. It had no tents and few wagons; it was\r\nbadly armed and its supply of ammunition was short. Its men were almost\r\nnaked, with not more than three days’ provisions in store. General\r\nGreene’s orders, under these circumstances, were as necessary as wise—he\r\ndetermined to divide his force into two bodies and post them on the\r\nright and left flanks of the British. Under his own command, the main\r\nbody was to occupy a position on the Pedee River; while a detachment\r\nunder General Morgan was to operate between the Broad and Pacolet. The\r\ndetachment under Morgan consisted of five hundred and eighty men in\r\nall—three hundred and twenty-eight light infantry, two hundred Virginia\r\nmilitia and about eighty cavalry. They were put in motion on the 20th of\r\nDecember, 1780, for the country between the rivers I have just named.\r\nGreene offered him wagons. He refused them as being incompatible with\r\nthe nature of light troops. When Cornwallis learned of Morgan’s\r\nmovement, he misinterpreted it to mean an attack on the British post\r\ncalled Ninety-Six. On the 2d day of January, 1781, Cornwallis addressed\r\nthis familiar note to Tarleton, which is indicative of the close\r\npersonal relations existing between the parties to it, as well as the\r\nwholesome respect they had for Morgan:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “DEAR TARLETON: I sent Haldane to you last night, to desire you would\r\n  pass Broad River with the legion and the first battalion of the 71st\r\n  as soon as possible. If Morgan is still at Williams’, or anywhere\r\n  within your reach, I should wish you to push him to the utmost. I have\r\n  not heard, except from McArthur, of his having cannon, nor would I\r\n  believe it, unless he has it from very good authority. It is, however,\r\n  possible, and Ninety-Six is of so much importance that no time is to\r\n  be lost.\r\n\r\n                                                       “Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                           “CORNWALLIS.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTarleton promptly obeyed these instructions and was soon in possession\r\nof sufficient information to warrant him in assuring Cornwallis that\r\nNinety-Six was in no immediate danger from Morgan. He then conceived and\r\nproposed to Cornwallis the plan of operations against Morgan which ended\r\nin the celebrated battle which we commemorate tonight and immortalized\r\nthe name and fame of the big raw-boned boy with the Irish brogue who\r\ncame to the Valley of Virginia in 1755 “out of the land of\r\nGod-knows-where”!\r\n\r\nThat plan contemplated a joint movement against Morgan on the part of\r\nTarleton and Cornwallis by which they would compel him “either to fight,\r\ndisperse across the mountain or surrender.” It was at once approved.\r\nCornwallis sent Tarleton a reinforcement of two hundred and fifty men\r\nand on the 7th of January put the main body in motion to act in\r\nconjunction with him. On the 16th day of January Cornwallis reached\r\nTurkey Creek. Filled with anxiety lest Greene should attack and defeat\r\nthe troops under Leslie, and having no doubt that the dashing Tarleton\r\nwith his superior numbers would defeat Morgan if he overtook him,\r\nCornwallis determined to await at Turkey Creek until General Leslie\r\njoined the main army. It was a fatal decision. Not more than twenty-five\r\nmiles away was about to be enacted the tragedy to the British arms, in\r\nwhich a rude and untutored genius, commanding undisciplined woodmen\r\nhalf-naked and half-starved, was matched against an educated and\r\naccomplished officer in command of regular troops greater in number,\r\nwell-fed, well-conditioned, and as thoroughly disciplined as any troops\r\nin the world. The beginning of the end of British authority over\r\nAmerican soil was at hand.\r\n\r\nThrough his superior system of scouts and their knowledge of woodcraft,\r\nMorgan was always thoroughly informed of the movements of his enemies.\r\nThe orders of General Greene required him to hold his ground as long as\r\nhe possibly could and not to dispirit the inhabitants by a retreat\r\nunless it were a necessity to save his troops from destruction or\r\ncapture. But the time had now come for him to retire in haste before the\r\nBritish or to give battle to Tarleton before Cornwallis could join him.\r\nWith a noble confidence in his troops, Morgan determined to fight. He\r\nmade his camp on the night of January 16, 1781, two miles from a\r\ngrazing-ground for cattle known as the Cowpens, sixteen miles from\r\nSpartansburg, South Carolina, and five miles from the North Carolina\r\nline. The news that he had determined to give battle to Tarleton was\r\nreceived by his men with exclamations of joy. He knew the enemy’s\r\nstrength was superior to his own—that the British infantry embraced\r\ntwice his number and the cavalry three times the little force under his\r\ncommand. He knew the advantage of the British because of their\r\nartillery. But he was unafraid. Against the superiority of numbers, he\r\nplaced the skill of his riflemen and their zeal to punish an enemy who\r\nhad wantonly inflicted upon them and their kinsmen and kinswomen\r\npersonal wrongs of the most grievous character. But above all, he placed\r\ntheir love of country and a willingness to die in its defense.\r\n\r\n“The night before the battle,” says Major Thomas Young in Orion, Vol.\r\nIII., page 88, “he went among the volunteers, helped them to fix their\r\nswords, joked them about their sweethearts, and told them to keep in\r\ngood spirits, and the day would be ours. Long after I laid down, he was\r\ngoing about among the soldiers encouraging them, and telling them that\r\nthe ‘Old wagoner would crack his whip over Ben (Tarleton) in the\r\nmorning, as sure as he lived.’ ‘Just hold up your head, boys,’ he would\r\nsay, ‘three fires and you are free! And when you return to your homes,\r\nhow the old folks will bless you and the girls will kiss you for your\r\ngallant conduct.’ I don’t think he slept a wink that night.”\r\n\r\nIt is as far beyond my purpose, Mr. President, as it is beyond my\r\nability, to describe the action which began at sunrise on the 17th day\r\nof January, 1781, and ended at “two hours before noon.” In the judgment\r\nof Bancroft, Morgan was at this time the “ablest commander of light\r\ntroops in the world,” and I content myself with saying that on that\r\nbloody but happy day his disposition of his troops, his personal\r\nbravery, and the result which attended it, all, all confirm the\r\npronouncement of the great historian. The battle was fought in an open\r\nwood, “affording to the movements of an army all the facilities of a\r\nplain.” Tarleton himself declared it to be “as proper and convenient a\r\nplace for an action as he could desire.” It resulted in an American loss\r\nof twelve killed and sixty wounded. Of the enemy, “ten commissioned\r\nofficers were killed and more than a hundred rank and file; two hundred\r\nwere wounded; twenty-nine commissioned officers and more than five\r\nhundred privates were taken prisoners besides seventy negroes.” Two\r\nstandards, upward of a hundred dragoon horses, thirty-five wagons, eight\r\nhundred muskets and two field pieces were also captured. The British\r\narmy was practically destroyed—the fragment which survived, with the\r\nflying Tarleton at their head, being driven pell-mell in ignominious\r\nflight to the main body at Turkey Creek. Thus again, by a single blow,\r\nwas another third of Cornwallis’ proud army annihilated.\r\n\r\nThe fame of this surprising victory spread throughout the country.\r\nGreene announced it to the army in general orders, saying the victors\r\nwere “the finest fellows on earth, more worthy than ever of love.” The\r\ngovernors of the Southern States made proclamation of the event. The\r\nCommonwealth of Virginia, in the plenitude of her gratitude, voted\r\nMorgan a house and sword as a testimonial of “the highest esteem of his\r\ncountry for his military character, so gloriously displayed.” From\r\nCharlotte, under date of January 21, 1781, the gallant General Davidson,\r\nwho was so soon to yield his life in resisting Cornwallis’ passage of\r\nthe Catawba, sent Morgan a note by “Parson McCaully” extending his\r\n“warmest congratulations on the late glorious victory,” and saying “you\r\nhave, in my opinion, paved the way for the salvation of the country.”\r\n\r\nGreene wrote him from Camden August 20, 1781: “The people of this\r\ncountry adore you.” “Great generals are scarce—there are few Morgans to\r\nbe found.” From Montok Hill, August 15, 1781, while Morgan was\r\nrecuperating his health, Lafayette wrote: “My dear Friend: I have been\r\nhappy to hear your health was better. I hope the springs will entirely\r\nrecover it; and then, my dear sir, I shall be happier than can be\r\nexpressed, at seeing you with the army. You are the general and the\r\nfriend I want.” In the Congress, a resolution was adopted placing on\r\nrecord on behalf of the people of the United States “the most lively\r\nsense of approbation of the conduct of Morgan and the men and officers\r\nunder his command.” It ordered that a medal of gold be struck and\r\npresented to him in commemoration of the gratitude of his countrymen. It\r\nattempted to sum up his merit in three words: “_Virtus unita valet._”\r\n\r\nModest, indeed, was the report of Morgan himself of the battle. “Our\r\nsuccess,” said he to Greene, “must be attributed to the justice of our\r\ncause and the gallantry of our troops. My wishes would induce me to name\r\nevery sentinel in the corps.” He did name some of his officers in that\r\noriginal report of the battle dated “Camp near Cain Creek, Jan. 19,\r\n1781,” and it will arouse the pride of every man of Irish blood to read\r\nthem. Listen to this much of it: “Major McDowell, of the North Carolina\r\nvolunteers, was posted on the right flank in front of the line, one\r\nhundred and fifty yards; and Major Cunningham, of the Georgia\r\nvolunteers, on the left, at the same distance in front. Colonels Brannon\r\nand Thomas, of the South Carolinians, were posted in the right of Major\r\nMcDowell and Colonel Hayes and McCall, of the same corps, on the left of\r\nMajor Cunningham. Captains Tate and Buchanan, with the Augusta riflemen,\r\nto support the right of the line.” In the Maryland Regiment, were Major\r\nEdward Giles, Morgan’s aid; Captain Gilmore, and Ensign McCoskell.\r\nMcDowell and Cunningham and Tate and Giles and Gilmore and Hayes and\r\nMcCoskell and McCall and Brannon, commissioned officers all, in one\r\nbattle! From this array, it would seem that the Irish may modestly lay\r\nclaim to have struck at least one blow for Independence!\r\n\r\nThe military career of Morgan was now nearly ended. Immediately upon the\r\ntermination of the engagement, he began that masterly retreat for a\r\ndistance of one hundred and fifty miles before the troops of Cornwallis\r\nand Leslie, to form a junction with Greene, which was so necessary to\r\nsave his little corps from annihilation or capture. To overtake him,\r\nCornwallis destroyed his entire baggage train, and converted his army\r\ninto light troops. But in vain. Though heavily encumbered by the\r\ncaptured munitions of the enemy and his celerity retarded by the\r\nprisoners of war, Morgan conducted his retirement with great prudence\r\nand success, and in twenty-one days joined Greene at Guilford Court\r\nHouse, his pursuers being but twenty-five miles in his rear. His heroic\r\nband was saved.\r\n\r\nEmaciated from want and crippled with disease resulting from hardships\r\nhe endured in the Canadian campaign, Morgan was now scarcely able to sit\r\nupon his horse. When mounted he could not ride out of a walk. He “was a\r\nsufferer to the verge of human endurance, and was forced to ask for\r\nleave of absence to regain his broken health. Slowly and painfully he\r\nmade his way homeward; and he was never again physically fit for active\r\noperations. But his warlike spirit was never at rest while an armed\r\nenemy of his country was in the field. In June, 1781, when Tarleton was\r\nraiding eastern Virginia, he raised and equipped a body of cavalry at\r\nhis own expense and at the earnest importunity of Benjamin Harrison and\r\nArchibald Cary, Speakers of the House of Delegates and Senate of\r\nVirginia, he placed himself at their head to join Lafayette. But in\r\nAugust his old malady compelled him again to retire.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the old hero chafed under his enforced idleness. The\r\ntermination of the titanic struggle was now discernible to his\r\nexperienced eye and he longed to participate in the closing events. The\r\nFrench fleet was in the Chesapeake, cutting off the escape of Cornwallis\r\nby sea. In his rear was Lafayette—there was no retreat to the southward.\r\nOn his flank was the Marquis of St. Simon—there was no flight to the\r\nmountains. And from the north, at the head of the main army, marched\r\nGeorge Washington with his veteran troops.\r\n\r\nThe stupendous event which took place at Yorktown on the 19th day of\r\nOctober, 1781, at 4 o’clock p. m., and its influence on the history of\r\nthe human race, all the world knows. Morgan was at home at that time on\r\na bed of sickness. He wrote Washington under date of September 20,\r\nlamenting that his condition prevented him from serving in the field. It\r\nwas a letter full of personal and patriotic utterances—so much so that\r\nWashington felt impelled to answer it in kind. His answer is dated\r\n“Headquarters, before York, 5th October, 1781.” “Surrounded as I am,” he\r\nwrote, “with a great variety of concerns on the present occasion, I can\r\nyet find time to answer your letter of the 20th ultimo, which I have\r\nreceived with much satisfaction; not only as it is filled with such warm\r\nexpressions of desire for my success on the present expedition, but as\r\nit breathes the spirit and ardor of a veteran soldier, who, though\r\nimpaired in the service of his country, yet retains the sentiments of a\r\nsoldier in the firmest degree.\r\n\r\n“Be assured that I most sincerely lament your present situation, and\r\nesteem it a peculiar loss to the United States that you are, at this\r\ntime, unable to render your services in the field. I most sincerely\r\nthank you for the kind expressions of your good wishes, and earnestly\r\nhope that you may soon be restored to that share of health which you may\r\ndesire, and with which you may again be useful to your country in the\r\nsame eminent degree as has already distinguished your conduct.”\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks’ time from the date of that cordial letter, Cornwallis\r\nsurrendered his army, the war of the Revolution had been fought to a\r\nfinish and the military life of Daniel Morgan was ended.\r\n\r\nTo his estate in Clarke County, Virginia, which he proudly called\r\n“Saratoga,” he now retired; and there he spent his declining days. For\r\ntwo years, in obedience to the call of his people, he served them in the\r\nCongress of the nation; but, as he had been most warlike in time of war,\r\nin time of peace he preferred the quiet shades of private life. On the\r\nsixth day of July in the year 1802, in about the sixty-seventh year of\r\nhis age, he passed out at Winchester, in Virginia, and there lies his\r\ndust in an humble grave.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the dust of Daniel Morgan is noble dust. Saving alone\r\nthose of the commander-in-chief, his services to his struggling country\r\nare the most remarkable in the annals of the war. From the valley of the\r\nHockhocking in 1774, he pledged himself to the services of his brethren\r\nof Boston and marched his riflemen six hundred miles to their relief.\r\nInto the hardships of the Canadian Campaign he led the van; and three\r\ntimes before Quebec he guided his men to the fire-fringed heights with\r\nthe courage of a demi-god. To him belongs the chief glory of Burgoyne’s\r\nsurrender; and at the Cowpens he won what Bancroft affirms was “the most\r\nastonishing victory of the war.” His life was a succession of sacrifices\r\nfor his country. Measure his services as you may—in number, in value, or\r\nin brilliancy—they are not surpassed by those of any officer of the\r\nRevolution, saving always the unapproachable Washington. In fifty\r\ncontests with the enemy he participated—eight of them being general\r\nengagements—and in those in which he was charged with the responsibility\r\nof command, he was either successful or achieved results which were\r\nequivalent thereto. His patriotism was proof against British allurements\r\nwhen he was a ragged prisoner of war; and his sense of honor repelled\r\nthe temptations of a superior brother-officer in the hour of victorious\r\nexultation. Into every danger where wartime duty called him, he “fought\r\na good fight”; in spite of every wile of the seducer, “he kept the\r\nfaith”; into the quietude of private life he carried the praises of the\r\nwhole army and the plaudits of the civil representatives of his country.\r\nBut he did not escape calumny. He paid the inevitable penalty which\r\nsuccess entails, and paid it with the smile of scorn and the noble\r\nsilence of conscious rectitude. The American people, as yet, have no\r\nMadeleine, no Valhalla, no Westminster, wherein repose the ashes of\r\ntheir mighty dead. But when that national mausoleum comes, as come it\r\nought and come it will, to it in some future generation the dust of\r\nDaniel Morgan will be tenderly borne and in honor inurned beneath its\r\nvaulted halls. Meantime, he sleeps yonder at Winchester amidst the\r\nlovely hills of Old Virginia, and, “in honored rest,” sleeps well well—\r\n\r\n                     “His truth and valor wearing.”\r\n\r\nNo marble pile marks his resting place. He needs none! Congresses may,\r\nhis countrymen never will, forget his devotion to the Republic. On the\r\nportals of St. Paul’s Cathedral, the stranger who would behold the\r\nmonument of its architect, Sir Christopher Wren, is admonished in\r\nstately Latin to “look around him.” _Si quaeris monumentum,\r\ncircumspici!_ Ye who would behold the monument of Daniel Morgan, lift\r\nyour eyes to the towering dome of your country’s Capitol and consider\r\nall that it represents! Read the Bill of Rights incorporated in the\r\ncharters of your commonwealths, and reflect upon the inalienable\r\nprerogatives it preserves to eighty millions of freemen! Study the\r\nconstitution itself and realize with Gladstone that it is “the most\r\nwonderful work ever struck off in a given time by the brain and\r\npurpose of man!” Ponder those blessings of liberty which, in their\r\nfull flower and fruition, every American enjoys tonight! And when ye\r\nhave done this, remember that Daniel Morgan was of the fathers by\r\nwhose blood and spirit they were established. Sublimer than effigies\r\nof brass, more enduring than granite shafts, are these memorials of\r\nthe men of the old heroic days. Upon the rights of mankind are they\r\nfounded, and they will remain even unto the last day of recorded time.\r\nAnd when Time shall be no longer—when, in the ultimate convulsion of\r\nnature, the archangel-trumpeter shall sound his summons for the living\r\nand the dead to render final accounting of their stewardship—before\r\nthe Judge of the Nations in the group of immortals who blazed the way\r\nfor the glory of the American Republic, will stand the tall Irish\r\nchieftain of the Virginia Riflemen, “with a countenance like the\r\nlightning and in raiment as white as snow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ST. BRENDAN, AMERICA’S FIRST DISCOVERER. HOW A LEARNED AND ADVENTUROUS\r\nIRISHMAN AND SIXTY MONKS OUTSTRIPPED COLUMBUS BY NEARLY TEN CENTURIES IN\r\n HIS QUEST OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE—A GRAPHIC AND CONVINCING TREATISE.\r\n\r\n                 BY THOMAS S. LONERGAN, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring all historic time, the Irish have been noted for their love of\r\nadventure and travel, and had commercial intercourse with the leading\r\nports of Europe and Asia for centuries before and after St. Patrick’s\r\ntime, which is proof that they had sailing vessels of no mean order. The\r\nconversion of the Irish people to Christianity, in the fifth century, is\r\nunique in the annals of Christendom, because it was accomplished by one\r\nman and without the shedding of a single drop of human blood—but the\r\ndiscovery of America by Irish monks in the middle of the sixth century\r\nis still a mooted question, notwithstanding the historical researches of\r\nIrish, French, German and American scholars, which prove that St.\r\nBrendan was the first discoverer of this western hemisphere. His\r\nexpedition was essentially a religious undertaking, as well as the\r\nfulfillment of a well-known prophecy.\r\n\r\nSt. Brendan was born in the year 484, at a place now called Tralee, in\r\nthe County of Kerry, Ireland. He was the son of Finnlogha, of the race\r\nof Ciar, son of Fergus. He was educated by his relative, the Bishop of\r\nErc, who was head of a local monastery at Kerry. When a child, young\r\nBrendan was placed in charge of St. Ita, at Killeedy, in the County of\r\nLimerick, where he remained for five years, after which he returned to\r\nBishop Erc’s monastery, and began his ecclesiastical studies with marked\r\nability. He was sent from there to St. Jarlath’s College of Tuan for the\r\npurpose of studying the laws and rules of the saints of Ireland, with\r\nthe injunction to return to Bishop Erc for holy orders, and in due\r\ncourse of time he was ordained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THOMAS S. LONERGAN, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  Of New York City.\r\n\r\n  Member of the Society, Litterateur and Lecturer.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSt. Brendan belonged to what is known as the second order of Irish\r\nSaints. Shortly after his ordination, a passionate desire took\r\npossession of him to go forth on expeditions for the discovery of\r\nstrange lands and the salvation of souls. At his ordination the words of\r\nSt. Luke produced a profound impression on his mind, which subsequently\r\nformed his determination to forsake his native country and to embark on\r\na voyage to a mysterious land, far from human ken and beyond a mighty\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Irishmen, in ancient days, found their way to the\r\nHebrides, the Shetland and Faroe Islands, and even to Iceland. St.\r\nBrendan is said to have visited the Western and Northern Islands, and\r\nBrittany in France between 530 and 540. When he returned home the\r\npassion to discover the Land of Promise, as foretold in St. Patrick’s\r\nprophecy, was stronger than ever. He went to St. Ita, his old nurse, for\r\ncounsel, and she advised him to build a ship of wood, and she told him\r\nthat he would find the distant land beyond the great ocean. He\r\nimmediately set out for Galway in Connacht, and gathered several of his\r\nfaithful monks about him, and they there and then began to build a large\r\nwooden ship. We are told that they built a peculiar mast in the middle\r\nof the ship, and secured all the other rigging for such a craft. They\r\nput aboard various kinds of herbs, seeds and provisions. They sailed\r\nfrom Galway along the Irish Coast to the Bay of Kerry.\r\n\r\nIn 545, according to the Irish annals and the Latin manuscripts, St.\r\nBrendan and sixty Irish monks, sailed from the Bay of Kerry, which still\r\nbears his name, and after an adventurous voyage of forty days, they\r\nreached the shores of what is now Virginia or Carolina, and are said to\r\nhave remained in this western hemisphere for seven years, exploring and\r\npreaching the Gospel of Christ to the natives, especially along the\r\nshores of the Ohio River. Most probably they trod the soil of New\r\nEngland. The reports of what they saw and endured are simply marvellous.\r\nThey found a fertile land, thickly wooded and full of birds and flowers,\r\nstrange animals and strange human beings.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that before the close of that eventful\r\ncentury the story of St. Brendan’s voyages and discovery was well known\r\nin every part of Europe. There are still extant thirteen Latin\r\nmanuscripts in the National Library of Paris which have come down from\r\nthe tenth century, and contain elaborate accounts of St. Brendan’s\r\ndiscovery of America. The Bodlien Library of Oxford and the Nuremburg\r\nLibrary of Germany contain several of the Brendan MSS. There are also\r\nversions of the discovery in Gaelic, German, Spanish, Portuguese and\r\nItalian.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1892, the late General Daniel Butterfield, the noted\r\nAmerican soldier and scholar, photographed one of the original Latin\r\nmanuscripts of Brendan in the Bibleothèque Nationale of Paris, which he\r\ntranslated on his arrival in this country, and he subsequently prepared\r\na learned lecture on the subject, which he delivered before the New York\r\nGaelic Society. The translation, has been vouched for by Cardinal\r\nGibbons of Baltimore as being almost literal.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript begins with a sketch of St. Brendan’s career and of the\r\nconfession made to him by Father Barindus, which was instrumental in\r\nfiring the imagination of the great abbot to make a voyage in search of\r\nthe Land of Promise, which was America. St. Brendan laid his full\r\nstatement of the confession before the seven wisest counsellors of his\r\ncommunity, which concluded in the following words, as translated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “My Beloved Fellow Warriors: I now ask of you counsel and help,\r\n  inasmuch as my thoughts and my heart are bent on one desire, if it be\r\n  the will of God. That land whereof Father Barindus has spoken, is the\r\n  land of promise of the saints. I have yet set my heart upon. What say\r\n  you? What counsel do you give me? Their answer was, ‘Abbot, your will\r\n  is ours; have we not left our parents, have we not forsaken our\r\n  inheritance, have we not delivered ourselves up unto you? Therefore\r\n  with you we are ready to go unto life or death.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nThey considered the story or confession a revelation to enable them to\r\nreach the land, of which Patrick’s prophecy had foretold. When once upon\r\nthe highlands of Munster, and looking out upon the Atlantic Ocean, St.\r\nPatrick said that a man of renown should arise in those lands and go out\r\nupon the sea and find the promised land. That prophecy has been a\r\nhousehold word with the people in the Kerry region for more than\r\nfourteen centuries, and was well known for several years before St.\r\nBrendan was born. The traditions of the Brendanian voyages, like\r\nBanquo’s ghost, will never down, because they are embodied in the\r\nliterature of many European nations.\r\n\r\nThe following passage appears in Otway’s Sketches, published in Dublin\r\nin 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Brendan, having prosecuted his inquiries with all diligence, returned\r\n  to his native Kerry, and from a bay sheltered by a lofty mountain,\r\n  that is now known by his name, he set sail for the Atlantic land and\r\n  directing his course towards the Southwest, in order to meet the\r\n  summer solstice, or what we call the ‘tropic’ after a long and rough\r\n  voyage, came to summer seas where he was carried without sail or oar\r\n  for many a long day. This, it is presumed, was the great Gulf Stream\r\n  and which brought his vessel to shore, somewhere about the Virginia\r\n  Capes, or where the American coast tends eastward and forms the New\r\n  England States. There landing, he and his companions marched far into\r\n  the interior and came to a large river, flowing East and West, which\r\n  was evidently the Ohio River. After some years’ exploration, the holy\r\n  adventurer was about to cross the river when he was accosted by a\r\n  person of noble presence (but whether a real or imaginary man does not\r\n  appear), who told him that he had gone far enough in that direction\r\n  and that further discoveries were reserved for other men who would in\r\n  due time come and Christianize all that pleasant land. The above, when\r\n  tested by common sense, clearly shows that Brendan landed on a\r\n  continent and went a good way into the interior.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now supposed that St. Brendan and his companions soon returned to\r\nIreland. Some writers state that he made a second voyage to this\r\ncountry, but there is no proof for that statement.\r\n\r\nIn the sagas of Scandinavia, America is called Irland Mikla, or “Great\r\nIreland.” The Scandinavian records contain an account of three voyages\r\nmade to America after the time of St. Brendan and before the arrival of\r\nColumbus. Voraginius, the Provincial of the Dominicans and Bishop of\r\nGenoa in the thirteenth century, devotes much space in his “Golden\r\nLegend” to St. Brendan’s Land. Wynkyn de Worde, the first English\r\nprinter, wrote a life of St. Brendan, which was published in 1483, just\r\nnine years before Columbus sailed from Palos. Several Italians, who\r\nwrote in the fifteenth century, had much to say about St. Brendan’s\r\ndiscovery, and it is to be presumed that the mind of Columbus was well\r\nstored with the traditions of America’s first discoverer, which had come\r\ndown through the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nHere are a few sentences spoken by St. Brendan on the banks of what is\r\nnow supposed to be the Ohio River:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Behold the land which you have longed for so long a time.\r\n\r\n  “The reason you saw it not sooner was that God desired to show you the\r\n  secrets of the ocean.\r\n\r\n  “Return, therefore, to the land of thy nativity, carrying with you of\r\n  the fruits and gems of all that your ship will carry, for the days of\r\n  your journey are near to a close, and you shall sleep with your\r\n  fathers. But after the lapse of many years this land shall be made\r\n  known to your descendants, when Christianity shall overcome Pagan\r\n  persecution. Now, this river which you see divides the land, as it now\r\n  appears to you rich in fruits, so shall it always appear without any\r\n  shadow of night, for its light is Christ.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing is not positive proof, it is at least pretty good\r\ncircumstantial evidence of St. Brendan’s discovery of this western\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nNearly all writers on Columbus bear witness to the traditional value of\r\nthe voyage of St. Brendan in guiding and inspiring Lief Erickson in the\r\ntenth century, and Columbus in the fifteenth, to the discovery of the\r\nNew World.\r\n\r\nThe legend of St. Brendan is treated in the general histories of\r\nAmerican discovery. In Winsor’s “Narrative and Critical History of\r\nAmerica,” volume I, page 48, there is a list of some of the different\r\ntexts of the legend. Payne’s “History of America” gives a brief summary\r\nof the legend. He says: “No story was more popular in the end of the\r\nfifteenth century. The critic who does not absolutely reject it, as the\r\nBollandists have done, may take his choice of original versions of it in\r\neight different languages: and St. Brandan occupies ten dense pages in\r\nWilliam Caxton’s version of the Golden Legend.” An English version of\r\nthe legend was published by the Percy Society in 1844 under the title,\r\n“St. Brandan, a mediæval legend of the sea, in English prose and verse\r\n(London, 1844).”\r\n\r\nGaffarel’s “Histoire de la dècouverte de l’Amerique,” volume I, contains\r\na chapter entitled “Les Irlandais en Amerique avant Colomb,” in which he\r\ngives an extended account of the story of St. Brendan, with references\r\nto authorities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. THOMAS B. FITZPATRICK,\r\n\r\n  Of Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President-General of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDe Roo, in his “History of America Before Columbus,” published in 1900,\r\nsays: “The story of St. Brendan was one of the most remarkable and\r\nwidely spread of the middle ages. The number of its ancient copies,\r\ncarefully preserved to the present day, its various translations and its\r\nlearned commentaries, published of late, sufficiently testify to the\r\nliving interest which the ‘Navigatio’ of St. Brendan excited. There is\r\nscarcely a MSS. Collection in Europe, of any account, where it cannot be\r\nfound.” There is a copy of the “Navigatio” in the Vatican Library since\r\nthe Ninth Century. De Roo gives full credence to the St. Brendan\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nLearned writers like Moosmuller of Germany, Gravier of France, Palfry\r\nand De Costa of America, not to speak of Irish scholars, have written\r\nmuch on St. Brendan and prehistoric America. Cardinal Moran of Australia\r\nhas recently written a very able work on St. Brendan. O’Donoghue’s\r\nBrendaniana and Webb’s Compendium of Irish Biography make mighty\r\ninteresting reading.\r\n\r\nThere are several ancient maps in the European Libraries which mention\r\nSt. Brendan’s Land or “Great Ireland” and those maps are being closely\r\nexamined by historical students interested in pre-Columbian discoveries.\r\n\r\nColumbus himself, while he was endeavoring to fit out his first\r\nexpedition, wrote these words: “The land of St. Brendan is the land of\r\nthe Blessed, towards the West, which no one can reach except by the\r\npower of God.”\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to claim that the Irish chapter in American history\r\nbegan with St. Brendan. It is to be hoped and expected that the future\r\nhistorians of this Western Hemisphere will recognize Brendan, the Irish\r\nmonk and famous navigator, as America’s first discoverer and give credit\r\nto whom credit is due.\r\n\r\nThere is still extant in the Monastery of St. Gall in Switzerland, an\r\nancient MS. containing the prayer of St. Brendan for the safety of\r\nhimself and his companions in his trans-Atlantic voyage.\r\n\r\n“Judging by the ancient documents,” says the learned Dane, Professor\r\nRafn, “we can have no doubt that Great Ireland was settled long before\r\nthe year 1000 by a Christian Colony from Ireland.” What Rafn calls Great\r\nIreland, we now call the United States of America. Rafn also claims that\r\na people speaking the Irish language were found in Florida as far back\r\nas the eighth century.\r\n\r\nThe latest book on this subject is by Mrs. Marion Mulhall, the wife of\r\nthe famous statistician, entitled “Explorers in the New World Before\r\nColumbus,” recently published by Longmans, Green & Co. Every student of\r\npre-Columbian discoveries ought to read that splendid work, which deals\r\nwith a mighty interesting theme in the field of historical research.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, traces of Gaelic speech and a knowledge of the\r\npoems of Ossian were discovered among the Indians of Florida. Ossian was\r\nan Irish poet who flourished two centuries before St. Brendan was born.\r\nBoth Thomas Jefferson and Napoleon considered him the greatest poet that\r\never lived.\r\n\r\nIn the light of modern historical research, it is absurd to claim that\r\nColumbus was the first discoverer of America. I am fully satisfied that\r\nLief Erickson and his Norsemen from the islands of the Baltic discovered\r\nthis Continent 500 years before Columbus; and I am as fully convinced\r\nthat St. Brendan and his Irish Monks landed on the shores of this\r\ncountry about the middle of the sixth century. Owing to the fact that no\r\npermanent settlement or lasting results came from these discoveries,\r\ntherefore they do not take a jot or tittle from the achievement of\r\nChristopher Columbus, whose name and fame are bound to live forever in\r\nthe annals of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford University press has just published a number of Irish\r\nmanuscripts in the English language which have been in the Bodlien\r\nLibrary for centuries. Some of those Gaelic manuscripts also refer to\r\nthe Brendanian voyages and discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe early Portuguese explorers believed in the existence of the El\r\nDorado, the undiscovered country of St. Brendan. The strongest proof of\r\nthis is that when the Crown of Portugal was ceded to the Castilians, the\r\ntreaty included St. Brendan’s land as a certain future discovery.\r\n\r\nThe high religious reputation and singular fame of St. Brendan gave\r\nconsiderable value to his manuscripts, from which sprang up an unique\r\nliterature, that planted in the brain of Columbus a desire to find the\r\nlong lost Land of Promise, which he eventually discovered in the year\r\n1492, a year forever memorable in the history of civilization.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that nearly all the original Brendan manuscripts are in the\r\nLatin tongue? Chambers in his “Cyclopedia of English Literature” gives\r\nan excellent explanation: “The first unquestionably real author of\r\ndistinction is St. Columbanus, a native of Ireland, who contributed\r\ngreatly to the advance of Christianity in Western Europe and died in\r\n615. He wrote religious treatises and Latin poetry. As yet no educated\r\nwriter composed in his vernacular tongue. It was generally despised by\r\nthe literary class, and Latin was held to be the only language fit for\r\nregular composition.”\r\n\r\nBoth Columbanus and Columkill or Columba were contemporaries of St.\r\nBrendan. Doubtless St. Brendan was an accomplished Latin scholar.\r\nThroughout Europe, during the Middle Ages, Brendan’s voyage was a most\r\npopular subject in church literature. The Brendanian Manuscripts are\r\nstill locked up in the various libraries of Europe, and only a few of\r\nthem have been translated into any of the modern languages. It is to be\r\nhoped that some of the great scholars of Germany, as well as those of\r\nIreland, will soon turn their attention to those old manuscripts. The\r\nBook of Lismore contains a life of Brendan in the Gaelic language, and\r\nthe annals of Clonmacnoise devote considerable space to the career and\r\nachievements of the famous navigator.\r\n\r\nIn view of St. Patrick’s prophecy, which was fulfilled by St. Brendan’s\r\nvoyage, it is a singular fact that the Atlantic Cable was laid by Cyrus\r\nW. Field in 1857 within sight of Mount Brendan, which stands out in bold\r\nrelief on the Irish coast, at an altitude of fully three thousand feet,\r\noverlooking the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn childhood young Brendan inhaled the ocean breezes, and was familiar\r\nwith the magnificent scenery of his native Kerry. At the foot of his\r\nmountain retreat was Brendan Bay, from which he sailed for this Western\r\ncontinent almost fourteen centuries ago.\r\n\r\nThe Sailor Saint is known as St. Brendan the Elder, in contradistinction\r\nto St. Brendin, the Abbot or Bishop of Birr. Some writers have\r\nconfounded those two illustrious Irishmen who flourished in the same\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nMany beautiful poems on “The Sailor Saint” are to be found in the modern\r\nlanguages of Continental Europe, and some historical ballads by Denis\r\nFlorence McCarthy, Thos. Darcy McGee and others in the English language.\r\nHere is one stanza from McGee’s well-known ballad:\r\n\r\n           “Mo-Brendan, Saint of Sailors, list to me,\r\n           And give thy benediction to our bark,\r\n           For still, they say, thou savest souls at sea,\r\n             And lightest signal fires in tempest dark.\r\n           Thou sought’st the Promised Land far in the West,\r\n             Earthing the Sun, chasing Hesperian on,\r\n           But we in our own Ireland have been blest\r\n             Nor ever sighed for land beyond the Sun.”\r\n\r\nIt has been recently pointed out by a writer on the subject that the\r\nancient Irish would have turned the discoveries of St. Brendan to good\r\naccount, and would have kept up communication with America, if their\r\nattention had not been drawn to the severe combat carried on in England\r\nbetween the Britons and the Saxons. Then, at a later period, the Danes\r\ninvaded Ireland, and for almost 300 years the Irish at home were engaged\r\nin continuous warfare against those Pagan marauders, and consequently\r\nwere in no position to carry out any great peaceful enterprise in\r\ndistant lands.\r\n\r\nIn the year 553, St. Brendan founded the famous monastery of Clonfert,\r\nin the County Galway, Ireland. In after years that seat of learning had\r\nover 3,000 students within its walls, most of whom came from foreign\r\ncountries. They were educated and entertained without fee or reward, and\r\nthe same was true of all the other great schools and colleges during the\r\nGolden Age of Ireland, which embraced the sixth, seventh and eighth\r\ncenturies. History tells us that Ireland was then “the school of the\r\nWest, and the quiet habitation of sanctity and learning.”\r\n\r\nDuring that age, “the monasteries at Bangor, Clonfert and elsewhere,”\r\nsays Montalembert in his “Monks of the West,” “became entire towns, each\r\nof which enclosed more than 3,000 students. The Thebiad reappeared in\r\nIreland, and the West had no longer anything to envy in the history of\r\nthe East. There was besides an intellectual development, which the\r\nEremites of Egypt had not known. The Irish communities joined by the\r\nmonks from Gaul and Rome, whom the example of St. Patrick had drawn upon\r\nhis steps, entered into rivalry with the great monastic schools of Gaul.\r\nThey explained Ovid there; they copied Virgil, they devoted themselves\r\nespecially to Greek literature; they drew back from no inquiry, no\r\ndiscussion; they gloried in placing boldness on a level with faith.”\r\n\r\nReligion and education went hand in hand in ancient Ireland from the\r\nbirth of St. Brendan in 484 to the Danish invasion, which took place in\r\nthe closing years of the eighth century. In that period Ireland was the\r\nmost learned country in all Europe. The fame of her schools had\r\ntravelled far and wide. The languages of Greece and Rome, as well as her\r\nold Gaelic tongue, were studied and mastered, and thousands of pilgrim\r\nstudents came to her shores, among them were Alfrid, King of\r\nNorthumbria, and Dagobert II., King of France.\r\n\r\nLove of learning has been an Irish attribute from time immemorial; no\r\nmind, not even the Athenian, had ever a greater thirst for knowledge\r\nthan the Irish mind. Ossian, who lived in the third century of the\r\nChristian Era, is to Gaelic literature what Homer is to Greek\r\nliterature. Intellectual vigor, spiritual fervor and love for travel\r\nhave been and still are the predominant characteristics of the Irish.\r\nWherever the Irish monks went they founded monasteries, churches and\r\ncolleges, and laid the foundation for modern civilization and culture.\r\nThe truest history of Ireland is to be found in the poetry of her bards\r\nand in the writings of her exiled monks. For proof see Zimmer’s “Irish\r\nElement in Medieval Culture” and Hyde’s “Literary History of Ireland.”\r\n\r\nSt. Columkill, a contemporary of St. Brendan, has been called the father\r\nof monasticism in the British Isles. He and Columbanus are acknowledged\r\nto be the two most learned men of their age. It is a well established\r\nfact that St. Brendan visited his countryman, Columkill, at his\r\nmonastery at Iona on the west coast of Scotland in 564. On that occasion\r\nhe founded two monasteries in Scotland. He also travelled in Wales and\r\nEngland, where he founded some churches and schools and converted\r\nthousands to the Christian faith. He built the Monastery of Ailech in\r\nBritain, which is now called St. Malo. That was several years before St.\r\nAugustine landed on British soil. So we see that Lecky was justified in\r\nstating that “England owes a great deal of her Christianity to Irish\r\nmonks, who labored among her people before the arrival of Augustine.”\r\n\r\nMost of the history which has been written during the past four\r\ncenturies has been a conspiracy against truth, but in these opening\r\nyears of the twentieth century history is being rewritten in the light\r\nof historical research, and in keeping with the spirit of truth and\r\njustice. The late Lord Acton was the pioneer, and his example is being\r\nfollowed by some of the great scholars of Germany and other European\r\ncountries, which may throw a flood of light on the chronicles and\r\ntraditions of St. Brendan, as well as on the golden Age of Hibernia.\r\n\r\nSt. Brendan attended the inauguration of Aedh Caemh (anglicized Hugh\r\nKeeffe), the first Christian King of Cashel in Tipperary in 570, when he\r\ntook the place of the official bard, who was a Pagan. On that occasion\r\nhe converted the bard to Christianity and gave him the name of Colman,\r\nnow known as St. Colman of Cloyne, in whose honor St. Colman’s College\r\nat Fermoy was named.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ussher, St. Brendan died at Annadown in 577, in the 94th\r\nyear of his age, and was buried in his own monastery at Clonfert. His\r\nday on the calendar is May 16—a day forever sacred to the memory of\r\nHibernia’s greatest navigator. No complete compilation of biographical\r\nwork fails to mention the name of St. Brendan, who is preëminently the\r\nmariner saint of the calendar.\r\n\r\nThe literary fame of historic Clonfert is known only to the students of\r\nhistory. Most of the precious manuscripts of that great institution of\r\nlearning were destroyed by the Danes and Anglo-Normans centuries ago,\r\nand its walls have long since crumbled into ruins.\r\n\r\n“Clonfert,” says the scholarly Butterfield, “should be dear to all\r\nAmericans, because our first discoverer was Clonfert’s Bishop. The Sea\r\nof Clonfert will doubtless remain during future ages as a shrine of\r\npilgrimage to numberless tourists, for it holds in its midst an honored\r\ngrave, where rests the dust of the patriarchal navigator who first\r\ndesignated this hemisphere as a paradise of loveliness, to give happy\r\nhomes and altars free to the myriad outcasts of the human family.”\r\n\r\nDuring the past two centuries, countless thousands of Erin’s sons and\r\ndaughters have found happy homes and civil and religious liberty in\r\n“Brendan’s Land,” now and forevermore the land of Washington, which has\r\nbeen for more than a century and a quarter an asylum for the poor and\r\noppressed of every race and every clime.\r\n\r\nOwing to the ruthless destruction of vast numbers of ancient Irish\r\narchives by the Danes and English, our knowledge of the first discovery\r\nof America is not as exact as could be desired, yet there is enough\r\nknown to justify Americans, regardless of race or creed, in claiming the\r\nhonor of that discovery for St. Brendan and his sailor monks, almost a\r\nthousand years before Columbus landed on the soil of San Salvador.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON.

BRENNAN, HISTORIOGRAPHER AND MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE\r\n    COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY, A MEMBER OF THE\r\n    NEW HAMPSHIRE HISTORICAL SOCIETY, AND HISTORIOGRAPHER OF THE\r\n    PETERBOROUGH HISTORICAL SOCIETY, PETERBOROUGH, N. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men who endured the hardships of this rough climate and encountered\r\nthe dangers incident to the opening up of this wild country, had to be a\r\nclass of men with strong hearts and resolute purposes. It was no place\r\nfor the weak; each had to be a soldier in the battle for existence; each\r\nhad to do his share in conquering the hardy soil and defending himself\r\nand his family against the ever present dangers of Indians and the wild\r\nbeasts which then infested the territory.\r\n\r\nThe Plymouth Colony, composed largely of Englishmen, had for over a\r\ncentury established itself in Eastern Massachusetts, provided itself\r\nwith comfortable settlements and enacted laws as intolerant as this\r\ncountry has ever known, but had not penetrated into New Hampshire. These\r\nPuritans, who, it is said, “first fell on their knees and then on the\r\naborigines,” had roasted witches, driven Quakers, Baptists and all\r\nothers, who were outside the pale of the Church of England, with buck\r\nshot into the tender mercies of the savage interior; fleeing from the\r\nintolerance of their own church in their quest of religious liberty,\r\nthey inaugurated a system of unparalleled religious slavery here.[14]\r\n\r\nThese Puritans were not the kind of men, with their selfish views, best\r\ncalculated to extend civilization; they received with disfavor and\r\nimprecations the hardy Irish Presbyterians who arrived in Boston in\r\n1736. These Englishmen always treated the emigrants from Ireland in a\r\nway calculated to discourage further Irish emigration, but this did not\r\ndeter these hardy men, who, however, found the inhospitable and cold\r\ninterior preferable to the section where the influence of Puritanism had\r\nestablished itself and left the darkest record of intolerance to be\r\nfound in the history of this country.\r\n\r\nIrish in considerable numbers had landed eighteen years before, but the\r\ncontinuing antipathy, which had ever existed in these English Puritans\r\nagainst the “Wild Irishmen,” as they termed them, were renewed on the\r\narrival of the men in 1736 who were destined to bring civilization into\r\nNew Hampshire.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1718 five ships, with a hundred or more emigrant\r\nfamilies, came over from Ireland to Boston; some of them found their way\r\nto Worcester and thence to Palmer, Pelham, Coleraine and other towns in\r\nMassachusetts; a large number, under the lead of the Rev. John Morehead,\r\nfounded the Federal Street Church in Boston, and one ship with some\r\ntwenty families, sailing for the Merrimac late in the autumn, was driven\r\ninto Casco Bay, and was frozen in for the winter at the place, which\r\nsoon afterwards became the town of Portland; their provisions giving\r\nout, they suffered some hardships, but found relief among the\r\ninhabitants there.\r\n\r\nA few families settled in that vicinity; the rest, in the spring of\r\n1719, sailed up the Merrimac to Haverhill, and thence proceeded to that\r\nhigh and beautiful region of country that was called Nutfield, because\r\nit abounded in nuts; and there they determined to locate their grant of\r\ntwelve miles square of land.\r\n\r\nThis grant had been made by Gov. Samuel Shute, then governor of both\r\nprovinces, upon a petition signed in Ireland, March 26, 1718, by 217\r\npersons, all but seven signing “in a fair, legible hand,” before they\r\nset out on their voyage. These sixteen first settlers and their families\r\nthat had thus arrived, on the 22d day of April, 1719, had come over in\r\ncompany with their pastor, the Rev. James McGregor, most of them from\r\nhis parish of Aghadowey, six miles south of Coleraine in the County of\r\nLondonderry, Ireland. Among them were Samuel Allison, James Gregg, James\r\nMcKean, John Mitchell, John Morrison, Thomas Steele and John Stuart.\r\nThey were soon joined by a large number of their compatriots, the lands\r\nwere divided out to a long list of grantees, and in 1722 the town was\r\nincorporated by New Hampshire authority by the name of Londonderry.\r\n\r\nIn 1736, seventeen years later, another ship, with emigrants from\r\nIreland, landed at Boston. These families passed the winter at\r\nLexington, and in the next summer settled at Lunenburg, Massachusetts,\r\nand other towns in that vicinity. Among them were the names Cunningham,\r\nFerguson, McNee, Little, Robbe, Scott, Smith, Stuart, Swan, White and\r\nWilson.\r\n\r\nFrom these two colonies southern New Hampshire was first settled.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Londonderry, New Hampshire, was founded, descendants of\r\nthe English Puritans from Massachusetts had settled along the Merrimac\r\nRiver as far north as the old town of Dunstable. Bitter jealousies\r\nexisted between the two sorts of people. At first it was said the\r\nPuritans hardly knew what to make of the newcomers; they called them the\r\n“Wild Irish.” When they started up the Merrimac in boats, and one boat\r\nwas upset in the rapids, a Puritan poet wrote:\r\n\r\n                 “They soon began to scream and bawl,\r\n                 As out they tumbled one and all,\r\n                 And, if the devil had spread his net,\r\n                 He could have made a glorious haul.”\r\n\r\nThe Puritans, in ridicule, said of these Irishmen that “they held as\r\nfast to their pint of doctrine as to their pint of rum.”\r\n\r\nThus was shown the relations existing between these Englishmen and\r\nIrishmen at that early period. Will this feeling of unfriendliness ever\r\nchange? When the English people release Ireland from bondage and permit\r\nher to take such a position among the nations of the earth that Emmet’s\r\nepitaph can be written, then and not till then will the Irish people\r\nlook with favor upon England and her government.\r\n\r\nThese Irish settlers were intensely anti-English long before that\r\nsentiment found violent expression in the War of the Revolution, in\r\nwhich they participated with such zeal and self-sacrifice. As recorded\r\nin the Peterborough town history, it was the attempts to establish the\r\nChurch of England and to destroy the prevailing religious systems, so\r\ndear to the people, together with the oppressive land laws, that created\r\nin these Irish Presbyterians a hatred for the form of government under\r\nwhich they lived. In Ireland they were made by that church the objects\r\nof persecutions as mean, cruel and savage as any which have disgraced\r\nthe annals of religious bigotry and crime. “Many were treacherously and\r\nruthlessly butchered, and the ministers were prohibited, under severe\r\npenalties, from preaching, baptizing or ministering in any way to their\r\nflocks.”\r\n\r\nAnd it is further stated that the “Government of that day, never wise in\r\ntheir commercial relations or their governmental affairs, began to\r\nrecognize them only in the shape of taxes and embarrassing regulations\r\nupon their industry and trade. In addition to these restrictions, the\r\nlandlords—for the people then as now did not own land, they only rented\r\nit—whose long leases had now expired, occasioned much distress by an\r\nextravagant advance of the rents, which brought the people to a\r\ndegrading subjection to England; and many of them were reduced to\r\ncomparative poverty.”\r\n\r\nThey would no longer submit to these wrongs, and “animated by the same\r\nspirit that moved the American mind in the days of the Revolution,\r\nresolved to submit to these oppressive measures no longer, and sought a\r\nfreer field for the exercise of their industry and the enjoyment of\r\ntheir religion.” How like the present condition!\r\n\r\nThe sentiments of these people were the same as of the present emigrants\r\nfrom Ireland. They were composed in a very small part of Scotchmen,\r\nEnglishmen and other nationalities, but the essential part of the\r\npioneers of this section, in fact, nearly all of them, were Irishmen,\r\nfor I assume that where men were born in Ireland, as they were, where\r\nmany of their fathers, some of their grandfathers and great grandfathers\r\nwere born, they were men who can unqualifiedly be called Irishmen.\r\n\r\nAdopt any other standard and a large part of the inhabitants of Ireland\r\nat the time they emigrated would not be considered Irishmen, and\r\nprobably few persons in this town today would be considered Americans.\r\n\r\nThese Scots (who, it must always be remembered, were of ancient Celtic\r\norigin) from whom the pioneers of this section trace their ancestry\r\nlanded in Ireland, as the Londonderry, New Hampshire, history records\r\nit, in 1610, more than a century and a quarter before their descendants\r\ncame to this country in 1736.\r\n\r\nThe early settlers of this vicinity may be taken as typical of the men\r\nwho settled other towns in southern New Hampshire. They were practically\r\nall Irish, many from the northern counties, with some from the middle\r\nand southern counties of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe towns settled by these Irishmen were, in most instances, named in\r\nhonor of one of the settlers, or from towns in Ireland; some, however,\r\nsubmitted to a change from the names first adopted by them, in order to\r\ninsure the obtaining of their charters; thus, when John Taggart and\r\nothers from Peterborough in 1769 settled in what is now Stoddard, they\r\nnamed it Limerick and it was thus known up to the time of incorporation\r\nin 1774, when its present name was adopted; the name of the township of\r\nBoyle was changed to Gilsum when incorporated in 1763; other similar\r\nchanges were made under English régime and through English influences.\r\nWhen, however, these Irish settlers themselves selected names for their\r\ntowns, no English influence obtained, for it must be remembered that the\r\npresent English and Scotch sentiments, we now hear so much about, did\r\nnot possess that sturdy, loyal Irish people; the modernly invented name\r\nof “Scotch-Irish,” for instance—so far as we have any history, tradition\r\nor information—was unknown, unmentioned and unrecorded by any of them at\r\nany time, the originators and promoters of this strange and peculiar\r\n“Scotch-Irish” theory being strictly products of our own time and of our\r\nown country; there were, for example, no such names as London,\r\nLiverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, given to\r\ntowns where these settlers located, but the selection of names was from\r\ntheir own people, or from their own Ireland, which they loved so well,\r\nwhere they and their ancestors for many generations were born, where\r\ntheir kinsmen and their descendants remaining are found today resenting\r\nthis modern “Scotch Irish” appellation, as these settlers would\r\nundoubtedly do themselves if living; it was in Ireland their sympathies\r\ncentered and found expression in their selection of distinctly Irish\r\nnames for the towns they settled, such as Dublin, Belfast, Coleraine,\r\nBoyle, Limerick, Derry, Kilkenny, Antrim and many other purely Irish\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThese Irish, who settled southern New Hampshire—the pioneers in the\r\nmarch of civilization—became the establishers and defenders of popular\r\ngovernment here; their blood, transmitted to the generation following\r\nthem, produced patriots who stood as a secure bulwark in defense of the\r\npolitical structure their forefathers had reared; thus, Irishmen have\r\nbeen identified with every movement in our state history from the time\r\nwhen the Irishman Darby Field discovered the White Mountains (naming\r\nthem after Slieve Bawn or White Hills, in the barony of South\r\nBallintubber, County Roscommon, Ireland) down to the present day. I\r\ncannot in this brief sketch refer to the part played by men of Irish\r\ndescent such as Gen. John Stark, Gen. John Sullivan, Gen. James Miller,\r\nCol. Hercules Mooney and hundreds of others, who have left their impress\r\nupon the annals of our commonwealth. In the history of our state and\r\nnation one thing is satisfactorily settled and entirely clear, namely,\r\nthat where Irish blood is found, there you will find true, unflinching,\r\nuncompromising defenders of the honor and integrity of our government\r\nand laws. The late Judge Jeremiah S. Black once said: “I have seen black\r\nswans, and have heard of white crows, but an Irish traitor to American\r\nliberty I never saw nor even heard of.”\r\n\r\nThese early Irish settlers were, in their religious belief,\r\nuncompromisingly rigid Presbyterians of the strictest stamp.[15] Their\r\nprogeny, however, have almost entirely abandoned that severe old\r\ndoctrine for the, so called, liberal modern modes of worship. However\r\nwell anchored these old timers may have been in their religious belief,\r\nit seemingly was not such as commended itself to their posterity,[16]\r\nand today we find no church of their denomination in this section, and\r\nindeed comparatively few in the state.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 the disaffection in Peterborough with the old mode of\r\nPresbyterian worship took tangible form; it was too strict; personal\r\ncontroversies at first broke out which led to dissensions and the\r\nsomewhat easier ritual of Congregationalism attracted a considerable\r\nnumber, and, having at that time only one church edifice, in the\r\ninterest of peace and convenience, communion was served at stated times\r\nin the Presbyterian form and at other times in the Congregational form;\r\nbut liberalism was not then satisfied and Unitarianism appeared to claim\r\nits share; with these dissensions came the Baptists and Methodists, then\r\nother religions of modern invention and atheism with no religion at all,\r\nfinally shared in the general mix-up; a sort of go-as-you-please\r\ncondition, embodying the so-called up-to-date ideas, where each strikes\r\nout a new religion to suit himself, or takes a hand in reforming old\r\nnotions, until the original anchorage was abandoned and entirely new\r\ndogmas were substituted for the old.[17]\r\n\r\nNone of these old Irish settlers were Catholics, far from it; but the\r\nCatholic Church, which they abhorred, was destined to flourish and grow\r\nin the town they established, and today that church has a resident\r\npriest and the largest religious congregation in Peterborough.\r\n\r\nBut the religion of these Irish settlers is not important in our present\r\ninquiry; I merely mention it in passing. We are not asking whether they\r\nwere Catholics or Presbyterians, Whigs or Tories, but are dealing with\r\nthe more pertinent inquiry—from a cosmopolitan standpoint at\r\nleast—namely, the nationality of the men who brought civilization to\r\nthis section.\r\n\r\nWhile many of us may not indeed agree with all their religious ideas, we\r\ncannot but admire their sterling qualities and take a racial pride in\r\nthe fact that the land from which they and their forefathers came, was\r\nthe same land from which we and our forefathers came; a land where the\r\npeople possessed the fear of God, and clung to virtue, fidelity and\r\npatriotism as cardinal principles; a people having the courage,\r\nconstancy and industry necessary for successful pioneers in this new\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThey were in no sense “Irish Scots” or “Scotch-Irish,” but Irishmen pure\r\nand simple; Irishmen to the manor born; Irishmen by origin, ancestry,\r\nsentiment, names, education and tradition; Irishmen with all the\r\nmanners, traits and characteristics of the Irish. This name\r\n“Scotch-Irish” is of modern invention. Why did it not exist in writings\r\nof years ago? Simply because these Irishmen claimed no Scotch\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nI verily believe that if a person had called one of these hardy Irishmen\r\na Scotch-Irishman, he would have received the same treatment Rev. James\r\nMcGregor dealt out, when an impertinent fellow replied to the parson,\r\nthat “Nothing saved him but his cloth,” he immediately threw off his\r\ncoat and squared himself for action, saying, “It shall not protect you,\r\nsir,” and gave the fellow a thrashing.\r\n\r\nIn these latter days, as the late lamented Col. John C. Linehan well\r\nsaid, a new school of writers has sprung up, whose pride of ancestry\r\noutstrips their knowledge, and whose prejudices blind their love of\r\ntruth. With the difference in religion between certain sections of the\r\nIrish people as a basis, they are bent on creating a new race,\r\nchristening it “Scotch-Irish,” laboring hard to prove that it is a\r\n“brand” superior to either of the two old types, and while clinging to\r\nthe Scotch root, claim that their ancestors were different from the\r\nIrish in blood, morals, language and religion.\r\n\r\nThis is a question not difficult to settle for those who are disposed to\r\ntreat it honestly, but, as a rule, the writers who are the most\r\nprolific, as well as the speakers who are the most eloquent, appear to\r\nknow the least about the subject, and care less, if they can only\r\nsucceed in having their theories accepted.\r\n\r\nThe Irish origin of the Scots[18] is studiously avoided by nearly all\r\nthe “Scotch-Irish” writers, or, if mentioned at all, is spoken of in a\r\nmanner which leaves the reader to infer that the Scots had made mistakes\r\nin selecting their ancestors, and it was the duty of their descendants,\r\nso far as it lay in their power, to rectify the error.\r\n\r\nThese old settlers possessed the energy, faith and cheerful nature that\r\ncould make life endurable under the hardships and privations of their\r\nsituation on the frontier of civilized society. They had brought with\r\nthem the manners, customs and habits of the Ireland of the seventeenth\r\nand first half of the eighteenth century. I need not repeat examples of\r\ntheir quaint humor and queer stories, or of their use of the ardent\r\nspirits on public occasions, church-raising, trainings, dancing parties,\r\nweddings and funerals. They believed in ghosts and witches and of course\r\nthe devil; indeed, the devil was seen in person, if old Fiddler Baker\r\ntold the truth, at the fork of the road, with horns and cloven foot,\r\nspitting fire.[19]\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions of this early time we need not wonder that when the\r\nadmission of a new member to the church was in question and objection\r\nwas raised that he made too free use of the bottle, “Well,” said the\r\ngrave elder, “if the Lord may have a church in Peterborough He must take\r\nsuch as there be.”\r\n\r\nNearly all of the schoolmasters of these early times were Irishmen from\r\nthe central and southern counties of Ireland, but their history has been\r\nsuppressed by modern writers, to the extent, indeed, in some instances,\r\nof omitting altogether the mention even of their Irish names.\r\n\r\nRev. John H. Morison, a Unitarian minister, wrote in 1845 a history of\r\nJudge Jeremiah Smith,—before this system of suppressing and falsifying\r\nhistory had reached its present perfection—and in recording the facts of\r\nSmith’s boyhood of about 1771, on page 14, stated: “He began to study\r\nLatin, when about twelve years old, with Rudolphus Greene, an Irishman,\r\nemployed by the town to keep school a quarter of the year in each of the\r\nfour quarters of the town. While he was hearing a boy recite he usually\r\nheld a stick in his hand, on which he cut a notch for every mistake,\r\nand, after the recitation was ended, another stick was employed to give\r\na blow for every notch that had been cut.” On page 16 it is recorded\r\nthat “he was sent for a short time to New Boston, to be under the\r\ninstruction of an Irishman, named Donovan.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VERY REVEREND ANDREW MORRISSEY, C. S. C., D. D., LL. D.,\r\n\r\n  University of Notre Dame.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for Indiana.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSome of the more recent histories, however, neglect to state that these\r\nmen were Irish. For instance, in the biographical sketch of this same\r\nJudge Smith, the Peterborough History (1876), page 288, states: “At the\r\nage of twelve he began to study Latin at the public school, which was\r\nthen kept in the old meeting house, by Master Rudolphus Greene. After\r\nthis he studied for a short time with a Mr. Donovan at New Boston,”\r\nquoted, with the word “Irishman” stricken out.\r\n\r\nIt is strange what an aversion some of the recent town historians have\r\nhad to telling the truth about these Irishmen, and with what studied\r\nefforts they have suppressed facts.\r\n\r\nThe Antrim (N. H.) Town History—which, in its dealings with the early\r\nIrish settlers of that town, presents the work of an expert in this\r\nperversion—in recording, on page 215, the services of that old Irish\r\nschoolmaster, Tobias Butler, makes no mention whatever of his\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nThe seeker of exact truth and complete historical data will, however,\r\nhardly consult histories written by narrow men, whose paramount idea\r\napparently was to twist the actual facts to conform to the way they\r\nwould have wished those facts to have been.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation or excuse for this condition is, that town\r\nhistories have to be written by persons familiar with the locality,\r\nhence the writer could be chosen only from a comparatively small number,\r\nand the selection, unfortunately, of men of contracted ideas sometimes\r\nbecomes unavoidable; but these writings relative to these Irishmen and\r\ntheir achievements, will never be accepted by the future seeker of\r\ntruth; it remains for the present generation, advanced beyond the\r\nprejudices of the past, to write the true history of these Irish\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE CARROLL FAMILY IN MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n BY MICHAEL P. KEHOE, ESQ., VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY FOR MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Material from which this Article is taken on the Carroll Family in\r\nMaryland was gathered together by the late Mr. D. J. Scully, who had\r\ncompiled a great mass of material for the purpose of publishing a\r\nHistory of the Irish in Maryland, when he was unfortunately stricken\r\ndown with a fatal illness. This material has been placed at my disposal\r\nby Mr. Peter J. Scully, who is a brother of the late Mr. D. J. Scully\r\nand his Executor. I want to offer my thanks to Mr. Scully for so kindly\r\ntendering the material collected by his late brother at a great\r\nsacrifice of time.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carroll family of Maryland has been for three centuries a prominent\r\none in the Province and the State, and may be said to have left an\r\nindelible impress upon the history of the Commonwealth. It would be\r\ngratifying to members of the Irish race to know that the family is\r\ndistinctively a Gaelic one and occupied for centuries a high position in\r\nIreland, being one of royal origin. The Carrolls are descended from\r\nCian, the youngest brother of Eoghan (Owen or Eugene “Mor” great) and\r\nson of Olioll Olum, first king of Munsters, who was the ancestor of\r\nO’Cearbhaill (Cearball)—Irish for massacre or slaughter—referring to\r\nsome incident possibly of the bearer’s life, Anglicized O’Carroll Ely,\r\nKarwell, Carroll, Gervil and McCarrell. It is therefore not to be\r\nwondered at that the descendants of this knightly race achieved equally\r\nknightly distinction in America. There were several different branches\r\nof the O’Carroll family all from the same parent stock, the principal\r\none of which was that of the princess of Ely O’Carroll, territory which\r\ncomprised the barony of Lower Ormond in Tipperary, with the barony of\r\nClonlisk and part of Ballybut in the kings county, extending to the\r\nSlieve Bloom Mountains, in the Queens County.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL P. KEHOE, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  Baltimore, Md.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for Maryland.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe title “Ely” as prefixed to the O’Carrolls is derived from Eile, a\r\nprince of the fifth century. Cearbhaill or Carroll was also the last\r\nking of Leinster who lived in Naas, the capitol in the County of\r\nKildare. He died in 909 and was a noted warrior, his sword being\r\ntreasured for centuries as a precious relic by fighting men. It is\r\nevident from what is known of this sword of Carroll that sword-making\r\nwas a fine art in Ireland in those days. There is extant an ancient poem\r\nin the Gaelic dedicated to the sword of Carroll which was recently\r\ntranslated by Prof. Kuno Meyer of the Liverpool University, who is a\r\nnoted Gaelic scholar. The poem is addressed to the famous blade and is\r\ntaken from the “Book of Leinster.” It is written in that intricate metre\r\nknown as “Derbhde” which it is impossible to reproduce in English on\r\naccount of its difficulty and has long ceased to be practised by the\r\nGaelic poets. Its opening lines are as follows:\r\n\r\n “Hail, sword of Carroll. Oft hast thou been in the great woof of war,\r\n Oft giving battle, beheading great princes.\r\n Oft hast thou gave a raiding in the hands of kings of high judgment.\r\n Oft hast thou divided the spoil when with a king worthy of thee.\r\n Oft hast thou been among kings, oft among great hands.\r\n Many were the kings with whom thou hast been when thou madest fight.\r\n Many a shield hast thou cleft in battle, many a head, many a chest, many\r\n    a fair skin.”\r\n\r\nThe O’Carrolls belonged to the second order of the Irish royal line that\r\nis the provincial kings, of whose ancestors sat on the imperial throne,\r\nalthough in the later days of the kingdom, since the dawn of the\r\nChristian era, the Ard Righs were chosen from the four great families of\r\nO’Melaghlin of Meath, O’Neill of Tyrone, O’Brien of Thomond and\r\nO’Loghlin of Tirconnell and O’Connor of Connaught.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ARCHBISHOP JOHN CARROLL.\r\n\r\nBaltimore and Maryland have had no citizen more distinguished or\r\ngenerally respected than the Most Reverend John Carroll, first\r\nArchbishop of Baltimore and first Primate of the United States. He was\r\nuniversally beloved while living and generally regretted at his decease.\r\nDr. Carroll was born in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, in 1735, and was a\r\nkinsman of Charles Carroll of Carrollton and Charles Carroll, Barrister,\r\nspringing from the same noble stock. He was the son of Daniel and\r\nEleanor Carroll and first saw the light within a few miles of the\r\nbirthplace of Thomas Clagget, the first bishop of the Protestant\r\nEpiscopal Church in Maryland, and the first one of that Church\r\nconsecrated in the United States. The little old-fashioned house in\r\nwhich he was born is still standing. In his veins ran the blood of two\r\nold Maryland families, his mother being a woman of many accomplishments\r\nand one who left a deep impress upon the mind and habits of her\r\ndistinguished son. Dr. Carroll’s early training was directed by her. As\r\na youth of eleven years, he entered the Jesuit School at Bohemia Manor,\r\nnamed St. Xaverius, where he spent one year as a preparation for\r\nentrance into the school at St. Omers, in French Flanders. After six\r\nyears of study at St. Omers, he entered in 1753 the novitiate of the\r\nJesuits at Watton, where he spent two years in preparation for an\r\necclesiastical career and four years later at the college of the Society\r\nat Liege. On February 2, 1771, he was ordained a Priest and a member of\r\nthe Society of Jesus. He surrendered his patrimonial fortune to the\r\nJesuits under the laws of the Order. The agitation against the Jesuits\r\nbeing then under way in France, and the Government having suppressed the\r\nOrder, Dr. Carroll with his colleagues was expelled from St. Omers and\r\nfled to Bruges in Belgium. He was later chosen by the Order in France to\r\nact as Secretary in correspondence with the French Court. His\r\ncorrespondence with the Government was extensive, but was without avail\r\nas far as causing the prohibition against the Society to be removed, yet\r\nhe created a favorable impression on both sides by his thorough\r\nknowledge of French and Latin, and the manner in which he handled the\r\nsituation. Pope Clement XIV finally on August 16, 1773, promulgated his\r\nfamous Brief, which he had signed a month before, suppressing the\r\nSociety of Jesus, and Dr. Carroll, having shared the prosecutions and\r\nbrief captivity of his colleagues, sought and found refuge in England,\r\nwhere he was selected by Lord Houston, a Roman Catholic nobleman, to be\r\ntutor to his son and in that capacity made a tour of Europe with his\r\npupil.\r\n\r\nOn the breaking out of the American Revolution, Father Carroll returned\r\nto Maryland to share the fortunes of his native land, his experiences in\r\nEngland having by no means created within his breast respect or love for\r\nher much vaunted institutions. He rejected many solicitations to remain\r\nin England, preferring to cast his lot with his own countrymen in what\r\nappeared at that time to be a struggle to the death. He secured\r\nfaculties as a secular Priest from the Vicar Apostolic of London “in\r\npartibus infidelium” as it was then known in the annals of the Vatican,\r\nand landed in Virginia on June 27, 1774. Passing over into Maryland he\r\ntook up his abode with his mother, on Rock Creek, and having placed\r\nhimself under the direction of the Vicar General, in Maryland, Rev. John\r\nLewis, he carried on mission work from Rock Creek to Aquia Creek, in\r\nVirginia. The congregation gathered in a small room in his mother’s\r\nmansion. It soon grew so large that St. John’s Church was built with Dr.\r\nCarroll as pastor. The Revolution when it broke found the old Catholic\r\nfamilies in Maryland on the side of the colonists and Dr. Carroll\r\nnaturally was one of the most ardent adherents of the patriot cause.\r\nDuring the Revolution he established himself near Baltimore, where he\r\nbecame the assistant to the Rev. John Ashton, a zealous priest, who had\r\nthe honor of celebrating the first mass ever said in Baltimore. Father\r\nCarroll’s talent as a Pulpit Orator soon attracted attention even from\r\nnon-catholics. St. Peter’s Church was often thronged with persons of\r\nmany religious faiths, who came to hear his sermons. Because of the fact\r\nthat his reputation for piety, learning and eloquence became so\r\nextensive and that through his long sojourn in France, he had become\r\nthoroughly familiarized not only with the French language but with the\r\nFrench people, he was appointed in February, 1776, by the Continental\r\nCongress, in company with Charles Carroll of Carrollton, Dr. Benjamin\r\nFranklin and Judge Samuel Chase, on a commission to proceed to Canada in\r\nbehalf of the patriot cause. The object of the journey was to create\r\nsympathy in Canada among the French Canadians in particular, with the\r\nAmerican cause and to induce them to revolt against Great Britain.\r\nHowever, the Canadians proved indifferent; a survival of the intense\r\nhatred which had existed for generations previous between the French\r\nCatholic Colonists of Canada and the Protestant Colonists of the\r\nColonies, who were prior to the Revolution pro-English and anti-French\r\nin sympathies. Therefore all hopes were disappointed and the mission\r\nfailed. This refusal to throw off the yoke of the oppressor was a\r\ndecision which it is but reasonable to suppose that the French Canadians\r\nhave long regretted, as their present unrest and discontent illustrates\r\nthey have not, even today, succeeded in securing happiness under the\r\nrule of the English and are still an alien people in Canada. The defeat\r\nof Montgomery before Quebec and the strong opposition of the Canadians\r\nto union with the Colonies rendered all efforts toward inciting revolt\r\nduring the Revolution unavailing. Father Carroll and Judge Chase finally\r\ngave up the undertaking in disgust and returned home, leaving Franklin\r\nand Charles Carroll to continue the negotiations, which, however, proved\r\nfruitless.\r\n\r\nAfter the American Revolution was begun, the Catholics within the\r\nseveral states, and they were most numerous in Maryland, became anxious\r\nfor a separation from England. Many attempts had been made to give the\r\nColonies now embraced in the United States a bishop of their own, as it\r\nhad been deemed impossible for them to live under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Bishop of Quebec, who was under English rule, and the Archbishop of\r\nMexico, who was under Spanish rule. As political reasons had kept a\r\nProtestant Episcopal bishop or church of England bishop from the\r\nColonies, so State reasons had also made the Catholics Colonists\r\nunwilling to accept an English prelate to govern them spiritually. The\r\nRevolution precipitated many things and solved many problems concerning\r\nthe Colonies and their inhabitants. The year of 1783 for instance after\r\nliberty had been established found both the Catholic and the Anglican\r\nchurches in the United States both considering the question of having\r\nbishops of their own who would be Americans and the founders of American\r\nhierarchies. As is known, the efforts of the Protestant Episcopal\r\nchurches or Anglican, as they were then termed in Maryland and later of\r\nthose in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Virginia,\r\nresulted in the consecration of Bishop Seabury of Connecticut, by the\r\nScotch non-jurors in 1784, and of Bishop White of Pennsylvania and\r\nSamuel Prevost of New York in 1787 by English prelates. Father Carroll,\r\nwhile he did not engage actively in the War of the Revolution, was an\r\nardent and active patriot, the more so because the Bill of Rights\r\nadopted by the First Assembly of Maryland held under the free\r\nGovernment, had bestowed full citizenship upon him and all Catholics and\r\nhe was therefore in an unfettered position to work for the cause.\r\n\r\nA portion of what Father Carroll did for the patriot cause was told in\r\nan interesting article published in the Catholic Mirror of February 10,\r\n1900, which is quoted: “A century ago, on February 16, 1801, it was\r\npublicly announced that the sleeplessness of George IV. was occasioning\r\nextreme anxiety to the British royal family. On that day William Pitt\r\nresigned, because of the king’s refusal to give effect to the spirit of\r\nthe recent union of Great Britain and Ireland by removing the\r\ndisabilities of his Catholic subjects. It is interesting to note that an\r\nAmerican bishop, as recalled in the following paragraphs, was\r\nresponsible in part for the King’s insomnia: Benjamin Franklin was sent\r\nby Congress to France to intercede with the King in behalf of the\r\nColonies. He was not successful. One bright morning he was sitting in\r\nthe waiting room of the King’s palace for an audience, looking\r\ndownhearted and forsaken, for he had received a letter from Washington,\r\nsaying: ‘If France did not send over her army, the cause must fail, for\r\nhis troops were commencing to mutiny and he could not raise funds to pay\r\nthem; they had no rations, their feet were on the ground and cut and\r\nbleeding from the cold.’ Franklin, looking downcast and woebegone, as he\r\nwas revolving Washington’s letter in his philosophical mind, was aroused\r\nfrom his melancholy stupor by a voice calling: ‘Mr. Franklin! Oh, Mr.\r\nFranklin!’ Franklin jumped up and rubbed his eyes. It was the Pope’s\r\nnuncio. ‘I have good news for you,’ he said. ‘I have just got consent of\r\nthe King to send over a French army and navy to aid your countrymen.’\r\nFranklin, astonished, threw himself on his knees and clasped the hand of\r\nthe nuncio, kissing it several times. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘Rome has saved my\r\ncountry. America will never forget it for Rome! The Catholics shall have\r\nall the rights the Protestants have. Convey to his Holiness the Pope my\r\nthanks for all the American people. We shall never, no never, forget it\r\nfor Rome.’ The nuncio said: ‘Mr. Franklin, you must thank Father Carroll\r\n(Bishop Carroll) for it was he who induced the Pope of Rome to send me\r\nhere in the interest of the American people. His letters in favor of\r\nyour cause were laid by me before the French King and Cabinet, and\r\nsuccess has crowned his efforts.’”\r\n\r\nSo, readers, if you want to learn something of the man who next to\r\nAlmighty God and Washington gave your flag and country, turn to the\r\nCatholic Cathedral at Baltimore and see his tomb. Washington himself\r\nsaid: “Of all men whose influence was most potent in securing the\r\nsuccess of the Revolution, Bishop Carroll of Baltimore was the man.” The\r\nEnglish King called him “the rebel bishop, Washington’s Richelieu, the\r\nprime minister and adviser of Congress, the man who got the Pope of Rome\r\nto use his influence at the French Court for the Americans.” “No, no,\r\nsir,” he said, turning to Mr. Pitt, the prime minister of England, “I\r\nshall never sign a bill granting Catholic emancipation after the action\r\ntaken by the rebel Catholic Bishop of Baltimore. He had America detached\r\nfrom my dominions by the aid of the French army and navy and by the\r\nforce of Irish Catholics. No, no, Mr. Pitt, you need not stop to argue\r\nthe question with me, my mind is made up on that question.” “Then,” said\r\nMr. Pitt, “if that’s your majesty’s determination, I cannot remain in\r\noffice, for I am pledged in one of the articles of union between England\r\nand Ireland to grant Catholic emancipation. It is necessary to save the\r\nunion of the British empire. I must resign.” “Then,” said the King, “do\r\nso, do so.” So Pitt resigned like a man and Catholic emancipation was\r\nnot granted for twenty years after this.\r\n\r\nThis shows what Ireland suffered for American independence. It also\r\nshows that Bishop Carroll’s influence was instrumental in securing our\r\nindependence. The people of Boston turned out to receive the French\r\narmy, which was led by a Catholic priest, with a crucifix in his hand,\r\nthrough the streets of Boston. All the ancient burgesses of Boston\r\nturned out and went to the Catholic Church in compliment to the French\r\nand all the old English statutes against the Catholics were repealed.\r\n\r\nThis is the record of the day. The incidents narrated in the foregoing\r\narticle throw some light on the services of the illustrious clergyman to\r\nthe American cause and also show why he was elevated to the primacy of\r\nthe Catholic Church in America. Subsequent to the Revolution, when full\r\nfreedom dawned on the former Colonies, the Catholics in the several\r\nstates, and they were most numerous in Maryland, desired no connection\r\nwith England, religiously, because English Catholics were at that time\r\nproscribed persons and without political rights or standing before the\r\nlaw, although it is true that active persecution had ceased. Yet still\r\nalthough freemen the American Catholics were under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe English Bishops, or Vicars Apostolic, and it was this connection\r\nthat it was desired to sever, so that the Americans could have absolute\r\nindependence religious as well as political. Father Carroll was one of\r\nthe six priests who met on June 27, 1783, in Baltimore and held a\r\nconference at which the necessity of being independent of England was\r\nconsidered. At this conference were present Father John Ashton, the\r\nex-Jesuit priest, who may be fitly styled the Nestor of the Catholic\r\npriesthood of the Archdiocese of Baltimore, and Rev. Leonard Neale,\r\nafterwards Archbishop of Baltimore. On October 11, 1784, Father Carroll\r\ntook part in a second conference, at which a plan of Government for the\r\nCatholic Church in the United States was drawn up, which included\r\nnineteen rules for the Government of the Clergy, was also adopted and a\r\nchapter of body corporate was formed, of which Father Ashton was chosen\r\nprocurator general and he was given charge of all the church property in\r\nthe Union. The chapter at a subsequent meeting at Whitemarsh, Prince\r\nGeorges County, resolved to found Georgetown College, Father Ashton\r\nbeing named as one of the first board of directors. Father Carroll was\r\nmade vicar general in 1786; in 1788 in company with Father Ashton and\r\nRev. Robert Molyneux, afterwards vicar general, drew up a petition\r\nasking that the American Catholic Church be given greater liberty by\r\nbeing put under the charge of a bishop directly responsible to the\r\nCongregation of the Propaganda, which at that time was understood to be\r\ndominated by French influence. This petition was successful, and Father\r\nCarroll was unanimously nominated for the proposed prelacy.\r\n\r\nDr. Benjamin Franklin, at that time residing at Passy near Paris, as the\r\nAmerican Ambassador to the Court of France, who was aware of Father\r\nCarroll’s charming manner, learning and ability, was able to use his\r\npersonal friendship to assist in having the distinguished divine\r\nelevated to the episcopacy. But at first Father Carroll had no idea of\r\naspiring to be bishop, and in fact the petition which was sent to a\r\nfriend of his in Rome to be brought before the Pope asked that the Rev.\r\nJohn Lewis be appointed for the United States, with power to confer\r\nconfirmation and to do temporarily other duties pertaining to the office\r\nof bishop. But, it is said that through the French minister to the\r\nUnited States a plan had been started to place a French bishop over the\r\nchurch in this country and Dr. Benjamin Franklin, ignorant of the\r\nposition of the Catholics of the United States and of their wishes, was\r\ninduced at first to lend his aid to the plan; but Father Carroll’s name\r\nwas mentioned and he immediately recommended him to the Authorities at\r\nRome. The Vatican was impressed with the recommendations of Dr.\r\nFranklin, whose fame was then as universal as that of Washington and who\r\nwas the idol of the Courts of the Continent; thus a Protestant Quaker\r\nbecame a potent power in naming the first Primate of the Catholic Church\r\nin the United States. On June 7, 1784, Pope Pius VII., ratified the\r\nappointment of Father Carroll as prefect apostolic and the nuncio at\r\nParis calling on Dr. Franklin to acquaint him with the appointment\r\nnotified him that Father Carroll would be probably made a bishop.\r\n\r\nAccepting the office in 1785, Father Carroll began his visitation and\r\nmade a call for more priests. At this time his salary, 210 pounds\r\nsterling, was paid by the Chapter, the organization formed in 1784,\r\nwhich was composed solely of ex-Jesuit Fathers. A few years only were\r\nnecessary to show the propaganda as well as all others interested in the\r\ngrowth of the Catholic church in America, the necessity for the\r\nappointment of a bishop for the new country, one who would be endowed\r\nwith full powers of consecration and authority. So a petition to that\r\neffect was again forwarded to Rome signed by Father Carroll and the\r\nReverends Robert Molyneux and John Ashton. This petition was sent\r\nthrough the Spanish minister, with whom Father Carroll had talked in\r\nreference to the subject, during a visitation to New York. Through his\r\nenergetic course and his knowledge of the needs and hardships of the\r\nAmerican mission as shown in his “Address to the Roman Catholics of the\r\nUnited States,” published in 1784, in reply to a paper of the Rev.\r\nCharles H. Wharton and in his report to Cardinal Antonelli, prefect of\r\nthe Propaganda, in 1785, Father Carroll had demonstrated the wisdom of\r\nhis having been chosen prefect apostolic. Cardinal Antonelli replied to\r\nthe petition on July 12, 1788, and communicated to the signers authority\r\nfrom the Pope to call a meeting of the American Clergy and nominate a\r\ncandidate for bishop and select a See. Accordingly they called a synod\r\nor conference at Whitemarsh, Md., and by a vote of 24 to 2 selected\r\nFather Carroll as the candidate for bishop and Baltimore was unanimously\r\nselected as the place of the See. Father Carroll wrote in reply to a\r\ncommunication from his fellow clergymen, notifying him of what they had\r\ndone, that “he was by that event deprived of all expectation of rest and\r\npleasure henceforward” and filled “with terror with respect to\r\neternity.” The nomination was approved on September 14, 1780, by the\r\nCardinals of the Sacred Congregation and Pius VI. issued on November 6th\r\nfollowing the bill erecting the See of Baltimore and appointing Rev.\r\nJohn Carroll bishop. Father Carroll accepted the appointment and sailed\r\nat once for England to be consecrated.\r\n\r\nFather Carroll was the recipient of numerous courtesies while in\r\nEngland, but soon hurried back to organize and develop his See. He\r\nreturned to America early in October, landing at Baltimore on December\r\n7th. He was received at Light Street dock by the Catholic laity and\r\nescorted to a palace which had been provided for him at the corner of\r\nCharles and Saratoga Streets. On the following Sunday old “St. Peter’s\r\nchurch,” which was selected as a pro-Cathedral, was crowded with\r\ncitizens of all denominations, to hear the new bishop speak. He made an\r\nimpressive address, in which he said: “In this, my new station, if my\r\nlife be not one continued instrument of instruction and example of\r\nvirtue to the people committed to my charge, it will become in the sight\r\nof God a life not only useless but even pernicious.” Shortly after his\r\naccession, Bishop Carroll received the Rev. Charles Nagot and several\r\nother Sulpitian Fathers, who had been sent to Baltimore by the Superior\r\nGeneral of the Order at Paris, Father Emery, at the request of Father\r\nCarroll, to establish a seminary for the education of young men for the\r\npriesthood.\r\n\r\nFather Emery had laid before Bishop Carroll in England shortly after his\r\nconsecration a plan for the establishment of a seminary in Baltimore. To\r\nthis plan Father Carroll had given his approval. Five seminarians\r\naccompanied the Sulpitians to this Country. It is told that on the same\r\nship there was a young Frenchman who was then misled by Voltaire’s\r\ninfidel teachings, but who later became converted to the doctrines of\r\nChristianity and consecrated his brilliant imagination and fascinating\r\nstyle to the service of religion and became the author of “The Genius of\r\nChristianity.” He was the illustrious Count de Chateaubriand. Acting\r\nunder Bishop Carroll’s advice, Father Nagot and his companions rented a\r\nhouse in West Baltimore located on the present Paca Street, near\r\nFranklin, known as “The One Mile Tavern,” and there they opened on\r\nOctober 3, 1791, the now famous institution, St. Mary’s Seminary. This\r\ninstitution may be indeed styled the mother of the American Catholic\r\npriesthood. Probably more Irish-American young men have been educated\r\nwithin its walls than of any other nationality.\r\n\r\nA letter to General Washington congratulating him on his open advocacy\r\nof religion and morals and upon the many notable honors that had been\r\npaid him, was presented to the great tribune by Bishop Carroll, Thomas\r\nFitzsimmons and Thomas Lynch in 1792, on behalf of the Catholic clergy\r\nand laity of Baltimore. This letter contained many lofty sentiments,\r\namong them the following: “You encourage respect for religion. There is\r\nprospect of a nationality peculiarly Democratic, because while our\r\ncountry preserves independent politics and policies we shall have a\r\nwell-founded title to claim from her justice, equal rights of\r\ncitizenship, as well as the price of our blood spilt under your eyes, as\r\nof our warm exertions for her defence under your auspicious\r\nconduct—rights indeed the more dear by the remembrance of former\r\nhardships. While we pray for the preservation of these rights we expect\r\nthe full justice of them, from the justice of those states which still\r\nrestrict them.” It will be observed that the gentlemen who signed this\r\nletter were all of Irish connection, judging from their names, which are\r\ndistinctively Gaelic. At this time the Federal Constitution was being\r\ndiscussed and the American Catholics had good reason to fear that the\r\npersecution and intolerance as well as the deprivation of political\r\nrights which had prevailed in regard to them in Colonial days, might be\r\nfavored and legally declared in the provisions of that instrument. For\r\nthere were those in and out of the State of Maryland who despite what\r\nCatholics and Dissenters had done in the battlefield for the achievement\r\nof American liberty and despite the aid of Catholic France which made\r\nthe securement of that liberty possible were disposed to establish a\r\nState religion and to deny religious liberty at least to their\r\nfellowmen, excluding Catholics from all political rights, although there\r\nhad been many Catholics in the Continental armies battling for the\r\npolitical rights of New Jersey and kindred “blue law” states. But these\r\npatriotic Catholics did not throw down their arms because of these\r\nabominable enactments, for their patriotism was too intense to be\r\nweakened by impulses of resentment. Therefore the American Catholic was\r\nnone too sure of his status in this Country and it is even a fact that\r\nefforts were made before the Maryland Legislature to have an established\r\nchurch; in other words, a state religion in Maryland, and that the\r\nAnglican or Episcopalian church should retain the same relation to the\r\nState of Maryland as it had to the colony of Maryland. But a vigorous\r\nagitation led by Bishop Carroll on behalf of the Catholics and Rev. Dr.\r\nAllison for the Presbyterians effectually prevented such a proposition\r\nfrom being made a law. On February 22, 1800, Dr. Carroll delivered a\r\nmemorable sermon in his Cathedral on the life and character of the\r\nillustrious Washington, who had died on the December 14 preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CHARLES CARROLL OF CARROLLTON.\r\n\r\nAs an Irish-American, Charles Carroll of Carrollton easily stands first\r\namong all of his race in the history of the past of this Republic, at\r\nleast so far as the State of Maryland is concerned, in character, in\r\npatriotism, in self-sacrifice and in services, if not in abilities. He\r\nwas born at Annapolis on September 30, 1737, and was the son of Charles\r\nand Elizabeth Brooke Carroll and grandson of Charles Carroll of Kings\r\nCounty, Ireland. At eight years of age he was sent by his parents to\r\nFrance, where he received his education, remaining six years at the\r\nJesuit College at St. Omers, six years at the Jesuit College, Rheims,\r\ntwo years at the College of St. Louis le Grand, Paris, and one year at\r\nBruges, Belgium, to study civil law; returning again to college at\r\nParis. Mr. Carroll went to London, in 1757, and commenced to study law\r\nin the Middle Temple, where he took his degree in 1764, and returned to\r\nMaryland, equipped with all of the attributes and capacities of a\r\ntrained scholar and lawyer. Yet with it all as a Catholic, he had no\r\npolitical rights in the Colony, where he was born and where by right of\r\ninheritance he was the wealthiest man in the realm.\r\n\r\nMr. Carroll, however, had no need to earn his living in the Courts and\r\nfirst rose to fame through his memorable controversy with Daniel Dulany,\r\nin which he took the popular side, although politically without personal\r\nstatus, and posed as the foremost champion of freedom. In this contest\r\nMr. Carroll proved an able controversialist and it was generally\r\nconceded the victor. His superb education had equipped him with every\r\nadvantage; he was the inferior of no man in the Colony. The effect of\r\nhis bold assertions and declarations against the Proprietary Governor\r\nwas electric on the people and made them the more apt for revolution.\r\nMr. Carroll wrote under the nom de plume of “First Citizen” and it was\r\nnot until the controversy was at an end that his identity became known.\r\nHis popularity became intense throughout the Province. It was but\r\nnatural that when the clamors of revolution became potent among the\r\npeople that he should become a candidate for public favor and honors. In\r\nDecember, 1774, he was selected as one of the Commissioners of\r\nObservation for Anne Arundel County and also on the Committee of Safety\r\nof the Province. He was elected to represent Anne Arundel County in\r\nMaryland Convention on December 7, 1775, and in February, 1776, was\r\nappointed by the Continental Congress a commissioner with Benjamin\r\nFranklin, Samuel Chase and Rev. John Carroll to visit Canada and\r\nendeavor to kindle the fires of revolt in that Country. Congress then\r\ntook up the discussion of a Declaration of Independence from England,\r\nand on June 28, 1776, the Maryland Convention in session at Annapolis\r\nresolved that the Congressional Deputies from the State be empowered and\r\nauthorized to concur with the United Colonies or a majority thereof in\r\ndeclaring all of the Colonies “Free and Independent.” On July 4, 1776,\r\nMessrs. Charles Carroll, Matthew Tilghman, Thomas Johnson, William Paca,\r\nSamuel Chase, Thomas Stone and William Alexander were elected delegates\r\nto Congress then in session at Philadelphia. Mr. Carroll took his seat\r\non July 18th, having just returned from Canada. It is related that on\r\nAugust 2 an engrossed copy of the famous Declaration of Independence was\r\nplaced on the desk of the Secretary of Congress for the signature of the\r\nmembers. Mr. John Hancock, the President of the body, in a conversation\r\nwith Mr. Carroll, asked him if he would sign the document. “Most\r\nwillingly,” said Mr. Carroll, who then took up a pen and signed his\r\nname—“Charles Carroll of Carrollton.” He affixed the name of his manor\r\nof Carrollton in order to be distinguished from his eminent relative,\r\nCharles Carroll, Barrister, and not, as is generally supposed, to show\r\nhis defiance of England and of the consequence which might accrue in\r\ncase the Revolution would be crushed by Great Britain, which would be,\r\nat least, the confiscation of his estates and his own reduction to\r\npoverty, if not execution as a traitor. His act is generally interpreted\r\nto have been caused by such an impulse alone, but chivalry as well as\r\nthe fine sense of honor, which then governed men and women, was\r\nevidently his motive in doing so. He was then the richest man in the\r\nColonies and his action simply meant also that if Great Britain won, he\r\nwas prepared to sacrifice more than any man in the Colonies at the time.\r\nHis cousin, Charles Carroll, Barrister, was almost as rich as he was,\r\nhowever, and either would have been a rich prize to the British if the\r\nRevolution had failed. “There goes a few millions,” said one of the\r\ndelegates who stood around and who had seen Mr. Carroll sign the\r\nDeclaration, thus showing that all agreed at the time that Carroll’s\r\naction was regarded as extraordinary. It was a truth that no single\r\nsigner of the greatest Charter of Human Rights ever written risked as\r\nmuch intrinsically as Mr. Carroll. He was a member of the Board of War,\r\nand served in Congress until November 10, 1776, with marked ability;\r\nbeing succeeded by his namesake, Barrister Carroll. In December, 1776,\r\nhe was a member of the first Maryland Senate and in 1777 he was returned\r\nto Congress and in 1781 was re-elected to the Maryland Senate. In 1788\r\nhe was elected one of the first United States Senators from Maryland,\r\nand in 1789 and 1806 was elected and reëlected to the Senate of\r\nMaryland. He was also appointed in 1797 one of the Commissioners from\r\nMaryland to settle the boundary line dispute between Maryland and\r\nVirginia. Mr. Carroll continued a member of the Maryland Senate until\r\n1824, when he retired from public life. In April, 1827, he was elected a\r\ndirector of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, and on July 4, 1828,\r\nhe laid the corner stone of the railroad at Mount Clare, Baltimore.\r\nWhile in Baltimore he resided at the mansion located at the corner of\r\nLombard and Front Streets, which was also the home of his son-in-law,\r\nRichard Caton, and his famous granddaughters, the beautiful Misses\r\nCaton, called “The Three Graces.” On November 30, 1832, Mr. Carroll died\r\nin Baltimore, full of years and of honors, having been for many years\r\nthe last of the signers of the famous Declaration. Physically he was of\r\nslight build and below the middle size, his face being strongly\r\nfeatured, his eyes quick, inquisitive, piercing and therefore thoroughly\r\nGaelic; his countenance was noble, and while in action and general\r\nbearing replete with energy. His manners were graceful and easy, as\r\nbecame a man of gentle breeding and education, and his expressions\r\nelegant, refined and usually considerate, even in conversation with his\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1768, he married Miss Mary Darnell, daughter of Henry Darnell,\r\nJr., and had three children by the union, Charles Carroll, who married\r\nin 1799, Harriett Chew, daughter of the Hon. Benjamin Chew of\r\nPennsylvania and sister of the famous “Peggy” Chew of “Mischeanza” fame\r\nand wife of Gen. John Eager Howard; Elizabeth Carroll, who married\r\nRichard Caton, and Catherine Carroll, who married Robert Goodloe Harper.\r\nCharles Carroll, eldest son of Charles and Harriett Chew Carroll,\r\nmarried Mary Higgs Lee and was the father of Hon. John Lee Carroll, late\r\nGovernor of Maryland. Mr. Carroll, in his declining years, particularly,\r\nwas one of the best known and beloved of Baltimoreans. He attended high\r\nmass at the Cathedral regularly every Sunday and dined frequently with\r\nthe Archbishops of Baltimore, particularly with Dr. Whitefield, with\r\nwhom he was intimate. The Archepiscopal residence was then located on\r\nNorth Charles Street, on a portion of the site of the former Young Men’s\r\nChristian Association Building, at Charles and Saratoga Streets. On one\r\noccasion, it is related that Mr. Carroll was introduced to a number of\r\nthe altar boys, on whose heads he placed his hands as they passed by\r\nwhere he stood and exclaimed: “God bless you, my boys. Love God and obey\r\nyour superiors. Honor and defend your Country’s flag, venerate your\r\nparents and obey the authorities of the civil Government.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DR. BRYAN DEFORREST SHEEDY,\r\n\r\n  Of New York City.\r\n\r\n  A Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Carroll at the time of his death was 95 years of age, his frame\r\nbeing bent, although his voice was strong, his walk firm and quick and\r\nhis eyes and face benevolent in expression. He dressed after the fashion\r\nof his day, his apparel including a dark waistcoat and knee breeches,\r\nblack silk hose, low cut shoes and silver buckles. He attended many\r\nfunctions, even just before his death, and was particularly in request\r\nat patriotic gatherings. One of the last public events in which he took\r\npart was that of a great dinner given to him by the great Irish merchant\r\nWilliam Patterson, at the latter’s country residence, “Cold Stream,”\r\nnear the City. The dinner was held July 4, 1831, the 54th anniversary of\r\nthe adoption of the Declaration to bring together the remnant of the\r\nRevolutionary heroes, then living in Baltimore. The occasion was made\r\nnotable in every possible way, numerous invitations having been sent out\r\nby the hospitable host, who was himself a hero of the great struggle for\r\nhuman freedom. Everything set before the guests except the wines and\r\nbrandies was produced on Mr. Patterson’s estate and the dinner was, as\r\ntradition states, a feast worthy of the distinguished company which\r\nattended it. The reception to Mr. Carroll was a most cordial one. He\r\ndrove out to Cold Stream, as was the fashion of the time, in his own\r\ncarriage, with his own colored coachman on the box, and was escorted to\r\nthe shady grove, wherein the dinner was spread by Mr. Patterson and\r\nseveral crippled veterans of the Revolution. There he was greeted by the\r\nassembly with uncovered heads and was given a rousing chorus of cheers.\r\nPatriotic speeches and songs were given during the dinner, which lasted\r\nfar into the evening and was enjoyed thoroughly by Mr. Carroll.\r\n\r\nThe great tribune was eminently social in his nature and many stories\r\nare existent which illustrate this trait. One of these relates to the\r\nfamous collation given by Lloyd Dulany at his private residence at\r\nAnnapolis, now part of the City Hotel, a few days after the burning of\r\nthe Peggy Stewart, at which function Mr. Carroll was one of the guests.\r\nAt this collation there was used a punch bowl which had been brought\r\nover from England in the Peggy Stewart, and Mr. Dulany explained how he\r\nhad come into the possession of the article, which had been sent to him\r\nas a present. The Captain, he stated, said to him that the bowl was not\r\na part of the cargo of the Peggy Stewart, as it was not on the manifest.\r\nThe Captain had placed the bowl in his cabin with his private property\r\nand had delivered it in person to him. To this observation Mr. Carroll\r\nis said to have smilingly observed: “We accept your explanation,\r\nprovided the bowl is always used to draw the same kind of tea.” As is\r\nwell known, the Peggy Stewart was destroyed because she had a cargo\r\naboard of the obnoxious stamp burdened tea, but the bowl was full no\r\ndoubt of that superior kind of punch which the Marylanders of that day\r\nso well knew how to brew. This bowl stood for years on the counter of\r\nthe City Hotel at Annapolis, and thousands of Marylanders have drank the\r\nsame kind of “tea” out of it since the time when Mr. Carroll made his\r\nfamous expression. This function, it may be well observed, was held in\r\nthe abode of an Irish American Lloyd Dulany, who was a connection of the\r\ncelebrated Daniel Dulany. Mr. Carroll was also connected in a way with\r\nthe famous episode of the burning of the Peggy Stewart at Annapolis and\r\nthe destruction of her cargo of tea by men disguised as Indians. It was\r\nhe who interceded with the mob at Annapolis in behalf of the owner of\r\nthe Peggy, Mr. Anthony Stewart, and he harangued the crowd from the\r\nsteps of Mr. Stewart’s residence and thus prevailed on them not to do\r\nviolence to the merchant, whose pro-English proclivities were well\r\nknown. He was the one to suggest that Mr. Stewart himself would destroy\r\nthe vessel, and its offensive cargo of “tea,” a suggestion which the mob\r\naccepted with delight, and which no doubt saved Stewart’s residence from\r\ndestruction. Mr. Carroll accompanied the frightened and shaking\r\nmerchant, as a protector, on that eventful day, when he went down to\r\nWindmill Point, where the Peggy lay, and himself applied the torch to\r\nthe brig and her cargo.\r\n\r\nMr. Carroll in those days lived in Annapolis and maintained the life of\r\na wealthy Maryland gentleman. He dwelt in a spacious mansion on what was\r\nknown as the “Spa,” in the ancient City, a quarter which was then the\r\nfashionable one at the State Capitol, and had been the same during the\r\nColonial Government and was known far and wide throughout the Colonies,\r\nas the most elegant locality in Annapolis, then termed “The Athens of\r\nAmerica.” His terraced garden sloped down to the brink of the lovely\r\n“Spa” and was held in by a pavilion with sandstone walls and ornamented\r\nby a pavilion where the owner and his guests could sit on a warm\r\nafternoon and enjoy the cool breezes from the water. It was here that he\r\nwrote his famous “First Citizen” letters attacking the proclamation of\r\nGovernor Eden (Colonial), imposing an extra tax on the people by\r\nincreasing official fees and by raising the special assessments on the\r\nclergy from 30 to 40 pounds of tobacco per annum. Mr. Carroll, as has\r\nbeen stated, took up the popular side and defended the people, being\r\nantagonized by Mr. Daniel Dulany, whose nom de plume was “Antillon.” In\r\na reply as to whom the “First Citizen” was, Mr. Carroll wrote: “Who is\r\nthe citizen? A man, in the prosperity of his country, a friend to\r\nliberty, a settled enemy to lawless prerogatives.” It was in this\r\ncontroversy that Mr. Dulany threw the taunt to Mr. Carroll that he was a\r\ndisfranchised English citizen and could not vote. All of which was true,\r\nfor, while he could not vote, he was at that time the richest man in the\r\nColonies and worth at least two million pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CHARLES CARROLL, BARRISTER.\r\n\r\nCharles Carroll, termed “The Barrister,” to distinguish him from his\r\neminent namesake, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, with whom he is often\r\nconfounded, was of Irish descent and was descended from the elder branch\r\nof the Carroll family, in Maryland, thus being derived from the family\r\nof Ely O’Carroll of Ireland. About 1681 the estates of the O’Carrolls in\r\nIreland were confiscated to the Crown, the family being accused of being\r\nroyalists. This confiscation was the cause of the emigration of the\r\nfirst ancestor of Charles Carroll, Barrister, also a Charles Carroll, to\r\nMaryland. He accumulated a large landed estate, having friends at Court,\r\nin the Calverts, which consisted of large tracts on the Eastern Shore,\r\nin Frederick County, in Anne Arundel County, in and near the site of the\r\nCity of Baltimore, on Carroll’s Island, at Mount Clare near Baltimore’s\r\noriginal site; and at other points. The Plains, an estate near\r\nAnnapolis, Claremont, for many years the residence of Hon. Carroll\r\nSpence, later Minister of Turkey, and The Caves, an estate owned for\r\ngenerations by the Carrolls and last held by Gen. John Carroll, which\r\nwas located in Baltimore County, were also included in the possessions\r\nof this thrifty Gael. This Carroll was in religion a Protestant, as were\r\nall of his descendants, including The Barrister, which gave him great\r\nadvantages politically as well as commercially, under the Colonial\r\nGovernment. He was a Physician by profession and was known as Dr.\r\nCharles Carroll. He married Dorothy Blake, daughter of Charles Blake, of\r\nan ancient English family and had by her several children, who were\r\nCharles Carroll, Barrister, Mary Clare Carroll, ancestress of Gen. John\r\nCarroll of “The Cave” and John Henry Carroll, who died without issue.\r\n\r\nAt an early age, young Carroll was sent to Portugal, where he was\r\neducated at a college in Lisbon under the immediate tuition of the Rev.\r\nEdward Jones. At ten years of age, his parents removed him to England,\r\nwhere he studied at Eton and matriculated at the University of\r\nCambridge, where his education was completed. Mr. Carroll afterwards\r\nstudied law at the Middle Temple, London. He returned to Maryland in\r\n1746, where because of his thorough familiarity with general affairs\r\nboth in Europe and in this country, he made an early entrance into\r\npublic life. Thus he became one of the people’s trusty guides in the\r\nstormy days, before and during that Revolution which accomplished so\r\nmuch for the welfare of mankind. Being a talented speaker and writer as\r\nwell, he was placed on all important committees and had occasion to\r\nprepare many public documents which were in their day influential and\r\nare therefore historic. One of these papers, the Declaration of Rights\r\nwhich was adopted by the Maryland Convention, November, 1776, was drawn\r\nby him and is a powerful as well as uncompromising elucidation of the\r\nrights of the people as well as arraignment of the English tyrant King\r\nGeorge III. He was appointed one of the Committee on Correspondence of\r\nthe Maryland Convention of 1774. The first Constitution and Laws of the\r\nState of Maryland was also drawn by him and in August, 1775, he was\r\nselected as one of the Committee of Safety. Mr. Carroll was also one of\r\nthe members of the Maryland Convention which assembled at Annapolis in\r\n1775 and served on a committee which on January 12, 1776, prepared\r\ninstructions for the guidance of the first Maryland Deputies to the\r\nContinental Congress. In 1776, he was selected President of the Maryland\r\nconvention held at Annapolis, on May 25th of that year, and was also\r\nelected a member of the committee of Safety of that year. At this\r\nConvention over which he presided the final acts of the separation of\r\nMaryland from England was accomplished, in the deposition of Governor\r\nRobert Eden and the notification of that personage that the public quiet\r\nand safety demanded, in the judgment of the Convention, that he leave\r\nthe Province. Mr. Carroll was also an active member of the Convention\r\nwhich met at Annapolis on June 23, 1776, and which declared the Colonies\r\nfree and independent States. At the Convention which assembled at\r\nAnnapolis on August 17, 1776, he was also a prominent figure and was on\r\nAugust 18 chosen one of a committee to draft a Charter of Rights and a\r\nConstitution for Maryland.\r\n\r\nOn November 10, 1776, he was elected to Congress as the successor of his\r\nmore famous relative Charles Carroll of Carrollton, by whom he was\r\novershadowed in reputation but not in patriotism or abilities or in\r\nservices to his country. When the State Government was formed he was\r\nappointed Chief Justice, but he declined the honor. He was then elected\r\nto the first Senate of Maryland, where he rendered distinguished\r\nservice. Mr, Carroll was justly regarded as being next to Daniel Dulany,\r\nJr., Maryland’s greatest lawyer. He was indirectly descended, as were\r\nall of the Carrolls of Maryland, from Daniel Carroll of Ely, who\r\npresented twenty sons all equipped and armed to the Earl of Ormond for\r\nservice under Charles I. Mount Clare, his home, was a favorite resort of\r\nGeneral Washington before and during the Revolution, and there is a copy\r\nof a picture extant, showing the illustrious patriot and Mr. Carroll\r\ngoing on a fishing excursion, from the latter’s mansion, their objective\r\npoint being the waters of the Chesapeake, which were easily accessible\r\nfrom Mount Clare. This mansion is now incorporated in the limits of\r\nCarroll Park, in the southwestern section of Baltimore.\r\n\r\nMr. Carroll at his death left his estates to his nephews, Nicholas and\r\nJames MacCubbin, the sons of his sister Mary Clare Carroll, on the\r\ncondition that they took their mother’s maiden name, “Carroll,” and that\r\nonly and use the coat of arms forever after. The will was dated August\r\n7, 1781. The MacCubbins accepted the requirements of the will and their\r\nnames were changed by special act of the Legislature of Maryland in 1783\r\nand approved by the Governor William Paca. These Carroll-MacCubbins left\r\na numerous progeny, which has intermarried and is connected with many of\r\nthe leading families of the State. Among the men of this branch who have\r\ndistinguished themselves in the public service may be mentioned Hon.\r\nJames Carroll, who was a member of Congress and also ran for Governor\r\nagainst Governor Platt. He afterwards served as a Judge of the Orphans\r\nCourt, and was a highly educated and accomplished man. Hon. Charles\r\nCarroll Spence of Baltimore was also a scion of the family, who became\r\ndistinguished. He represented Baltimore in the Maryland Legislature in\r\n1845 and was later appointed by President Buchanan to effect the\r\nratification of a treaty between the United States and Persia.\r\nSubsequently he was sent as United States Minister to Turkey, filling\r\nthe post with distinction. Gen. John Carroll of the Caves is also a\r\nscion of the family and is a well known citizen of Baltimore County. He\r\nwas a member of the Maryland Legislature of 1860, when only 22 years of\r\nage and was Chief of Cavalry in Maryland, with the rank of Brigadier\r\nGeneral in 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DANIEL CARROLL.\r\n\r\nDaniel Carroll was a brother of the great Archbishop and is of a\r\nconsequence somewhat overshadowed by his name and fame, and yet he was a\r\nman who achieved considerable distinction in his day and was a worthy\r\nmember of his distinguished family. He was born in 1730 at Upper\r\nMarlboro and was a man of high character and attainments. As soon as the\r\nshackles placed upon the Catholics in Maryland were stricken off by the\r\nRevolution and they were given free participation in public affairs, Mr.\r\nCarroll was elected a member of the Maryland State Senate and was\r\nconstantly in public life, either as a member of the Senate or as a\r\nDelegate to the Continental Congress, a representative to Congress prior\r\nto the adoption of the Federal Constitution, or as a delegate to the\r\nFederal Constitutional Convention of 1787. He was also appointed by\r\nWashington a member of the commission to select the site of the National\r\nCapitol, serving with Governor Johnson of Maryland and Dr. David Stewart\r\nof Virginia. He died in May, 1796, aged 66 years. Mr. Carroll was a man\r\nof great wealth, possessing in addition to his own share of his father’s\r\nproperty, also that renounced by his brother Archbishop Carroll when he\r\nbecame a Jesuit. He owned considerable real estate in the District of\r\nColumbia and in the present boundaries of Washington, D. C., including\r\nthe site of the Capitol, and also had large real estate holdings within\r\nthe corporate limits of the City of Baltimore. In fact, with Charles\r\nCarroll of Carrollton, he owned practically all of the original site of\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  HOW IT BECAME PLAIN “MR. PRESIDENT”[20]—DETERMINED OPPOSITION OF AN\r\n IRISH-AMERICAN DEFEATED THE EFFORTS OF THE TITLE SEEKERS IN THE EARLY\r\n                        HISTORY OF OUR REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n                      BY MR. EDGAR STANTON MACLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n                     MANY FAVORED MONARCHIAL FORMS.\r\n\r\nSo far as the writer has been able to ascertain the United States Senate\r\nnever has officially repudiated a resolution placed on its files, May\r\n14, 1789, to the effect that it favored a title for the President and,\r\ninferentially, titles of commensurate degrees for the members of the\r\nCabinet, Congress and other Government officials down to the\r\nSergeant-at-arms of the Senate whom Vice-President John Adams wished to\r\nstyle “Usher of the Black Rod.” It was even suggested that a “canopied\r\nthrone” be erected in the Senate chamber for Washington’s use.\r\n\r\nAmong the titles seriously considered for Washington were “His Elective\r\nMajesty,” “His Highness, the President of the United States of America\r\nand Protector of the Rights of the Same,” “His Elective Highness,” etc.;\r\nwhile his inaugural address was referred to in the minutes of the Senate\r\nas “His Most Gracious Speech.”\r\n\r\nIt is of record that Senators were addressed as “Your Highness of the\r\nSenate” and Representatives as “Your Highness of the Lower House,” while\r\nit was solemnly suggested that the proper manner for the Senate to\r\nreceive the Clerk of the House of Representatives was for the\r\nSergeant-at-arms or “Usher of the Black Rod,” with the mace on his\r\nshoulder, to meet the Clerk at the door. In view of the ire aroused\r\nbetween the two Houses at that time, a mallet in the hands of the “Usher\r\nof the Black Rod,” when he met the Clerk of the House of Representatives\r\nat the door, would have carried out the feelings of some of the Senators\r\nbetter than a mace.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the apings of royalty that were seriously considered\r\nby Congress and, on May 14, 1789, endorsed in the Senate by the very\r\nrespectable vote of ten to eight. When the British burned some of the\r\nFederal buildings in Washington, 1814, many public records were\r\ndestroyed, so there is difficulty in determining if this endorsement of\r\nmonarchial forms was rescinded at any time from 1789 to 1814. Still,\r\nthough one hundred and eighteen years have lapsed since 1789, it is not\r\nyet too late for the Senate to purge itself of this “dreadful” contempt\r\nof the great American people on this subject of titles.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, best known to themselves, the members of the first\r\nSenate decided that their session should be held behind closed doors.\r\nHouse rule No. 11, as inscribed on the cover of William Maclay’s\r\njournal, reads: “Inviolable secrecy shall be observed with respect to\r\nall matters transacted in the Senate while the doors are shut or as\r\noften as the same is enjoined from the chair.” The result has been that\r\nfor more than a century afterward this important chapter in our history\r\nhas remained almost a blank. Fortunate it was that Maclay, who with\r\nRobert Morris represented Pennsylvania in the first Senate, kept a daily\r\nrecord of the doings of the Upper House for the two years he was\r\nSenator.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this journal that the first great question that\r\nconfronted Congress when it held its initial session in New York, April,\r\n1789, was whether or not this “experiment” in government was to assume\r\nmonarchial forms. Under date of May 1, 1789, Maclay records: “That the\r\nmotives of the actors in the late Revolution were various cannot be\r\ndoubted. The abolishing of royalty, the extinguishment of patronage and\r\ndependencies attached to that form of government, were the exalted\r\nmotives of many revolutionists and these were the improvements meant by\r\nthem to be made of the war which was forced on us by British\r\naggression—in fine, the amelioration of government and bettering the\r\ncondition of mankind. These ends and none other were publicly avowed and\r\nall our constitutions and public acts were formed in this spirit.\r\n\r\n“Yet there were not wanting a party whose motives were different. They\r\nwished for the loaves and fishes of government and cared for nothing\r\nelse but a translation of the diadem from London to Boston, New York or\r\nPhiladelphia, or, in other words, the creation of a new monarchy in\r\nAmerica and to form niches for themselves in the temple of royalty. This\r\nspirit manifested itself strongly among the officers at the close of the\r\nwar and I have been afraid the army would not have been disbanded if the\r\ncommon soldiers could have been kept together. This spirit they\r\ndeveloped in the Order of Cincinnati, where I trust it will expend\r\nitself in a harmless flame and soon become extinguished.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n                         A COMMITTEE ON TITLES.\r\n\r\nCongress was to have met March 4, 1789, but a quorum of the House of\r\nRepresentatives was not had until April 1 and in the Senate not until\r\nfour days later. From this time until the arrival of President\r\nWashington, April 23—Vice-President John Adams arriving only three days\r\nbefore—the attention of Congress was taken up with preliminary matters\r\nsuch as providing a home for the Executive, framing rules for\r\nthemselves, considering details of the inauguration, etc.\r\n\r\nOn April 23 Senators Oliver Ellsworth, William S. Johnson (both of\r\nConnecticut) and Richard Henry Lee of Virginia, at the instance of\r\nAdams, were appointed a committee to confer with the House of\r\nRepresentatives on titles—and thus began one of the fiercest debates in\r\nthe history of the first United States Senate. On its outcome hinged the\r\nquestion whether the new government was to be monarchial in its forms or\r\nstrictly plebeian.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary skirmish Lee, on April 23, produced a copy of the\r\nresolution for appointing the Title Committee and moved that it be\r\ntransmitted to the House of Representatives. This was opposed by Maclay,\r\nwho records that Lee knew “the giving of titles would hurt us. I showed\r\nthe absurdity of his motion, plain enough, but it seems to me that by\r\ngetting a division of the resolution I could perhaps throw out the part\r\nabout titles altogether. Mr. [Charles] Carroll of Maryland showed that\r\nhe was against titles.” The motion, notwithstanding, was carried.\r\n\r\nBut now Adams precipitated matters by asking how he should direct a\r\nletter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and called on the\r\nSenators for enlightenment. There was a manifest disinclination to\r\ninterfere, but the Vice-President persisted until the question was\r\npointedly put as to whether the Speaker should be styled “Honorable.” It\r\nwas passed in the negative and the first victory against titles was\r\nscored.\r\n\r\nIt was only a few days after this, May 16, that a letter was received in\r\nthe Senate addressed “His Excellency, the Vice-President.” Adams said\r\nthat he supposed that it was intended for him but was improperly\r\ndirected. “He asked the opinion of the Senate, laughingly, and concluded\r\nit was against all rule. I [Maclay] said that until we had a rule\r\nobliging people to be regular we must submit to their irregularities,\r\nmore especially of this kind. Mr. Morris said the majesty of the people\r\nwould do as they pleased. All this I considered as sportive. But Adams\r\nput a serious question: Should the letter, so directed, be read? John\r\nLangdon [Senator from New Hampshire] and sundry others said yes, and\r\nread it was. It proved to be from Loudon, the printer, offering to print\r\nfor the Senate.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n                    POWERFUL LEADERS SUPPORT TITLES.\r\n\r\nThat Adams was honest in his belief in titles, insignia of rank and\r\noutward exhibitions of authority, and that he took a leading part in the\r\neffort to establish them in the new government, is more than probable.\r\nIn 1829 John Randolph of Virginia recorded: “I was in New York when John\r\nAdams took his seat as Vice-President. I recollect that I was a school\r\nboy at the time, attending the lobby of Congress when I ought to have\r\nbeen at school. I remember the manner in which my brother was spurned by\r\nthe coachman of the then Vice-President for coming too near the\r\n‘scutcheon of the viceregal carriage.’” In a letter to [James] Madison,\r\nJefferson wrote that the question of titles had become serious in the\r\ntwo Houses. “J. Adams espoused the cause of titles with great\r\nearnestness. His friend, R. H. Lee, although elected as a Republican\r\nenemy to an aristocratic Constitution, was a most zealous second.... Had\r\nthe project succeeded, it would have subjected the President to a\r\nserious dilemma and given a deep wound to our infant Government.”\r\n\r\nUnder date of June 12, 1789, Senator William Grayson of Virginia wrote\r\nto Patrick Henry: “Is it not still stranger that John Adams should be\r\nfor titles and dignities and preëminences, and should despise the herd\r\nand the ill-bred? It is said he was the _primum nobile_ in the Senate\r\nfor titles for the President.” “Even Roger Sherman” [Congressman from\r\nConnecticut], wrote John Armstrong to General Gates, April 7, 1789, “has\r\nset his head at work to devise some style of address more novel and\r\ndignified than ‘Excellency.’ Yet, in the midst of this admiration, there\r\nare skeptics who doubt its propriety and wits who amuse themselves at\r\nits expense. The first will grumble and the last will laugh, and the\r\nPresident should be prepared to meet the attacks of both with firmness\r\nand good nature.”\r\n\r\nThat there existed a strong sentiment against titles can be surmised\r\nfrom a caricature that appeared in New York about the time of\r\nWashington’s inauguration. It was entitled “The Entry” and was “full of\r\nvery disloyal and profane allusions.” Washington was depicted riding on\r\na donkey. Colonel David Humphreys [Washington’s aide-de-camp] was\r\nrepresented as leading the animal and “chanting hosannas and birthday\r\nodes.” In the background the devil is represented as saying:\r\n\r\n                  “The glorious time has come to pass\r\n                  When David shall conduct an ass.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n                        PRECEDENTS FAVOR TITLES.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten, however, that Adams, Lee and other advocates\r\nof titles were powerfully supported in their position by precedents. It\r\nwas shown that in almost every other detail Americans had adopted\r\nEnglish and German—then the dominating races in the thirteen\r\ncolonies—methods of procedure. The postal service was based on imported\r\nlines, our dollar was copied from the Bohemian “thaler,” colonial\r\njurisprudence had its main inspiration in British law. Churches and\r\ncustom-houses were conducted much the same as in the old countries.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that opposition to any elaborate form of divine service\r\nbeing connected with Washington’s inauguration was overruled shows how\r\nclosely the founders of the “new” government followed Old World\r\nexamples. It appears that the inauguration had been planned with a view\r\nto excluding the clergy in their official capacities and, in all\r\nprobability, this programme would have been carried out had not the\r\nministers in New York protested. Here again precedents from motherlands\r\ncarried the day. When, at the eleventh hour the “sacrilege” was called\r\nto the attention of the Right Reverend Provoost, Episcopal bishop of New\r\nYork, he cautiously replied that the Church of England “had always been\r\nused to look up to Government upon such occasions.” “The question of\r\nholding services on the day of the inauguration,” records Ebenezer\r\nHazard, “had been agitated by the clergymen in town.... The bishop\r\nthought it prudent not to do anything till they knew what Government\r\nwould direct. If the good bishop never prays without an order from\r\nGovernment,” wrote Hazard, “it is not probable that the kingdom of\r\nheaven will suffer much from his violence.”\r\n\r\nIn the light of these facts it is not strange that we find Adams, Lee\r\nand others turning their eyes to procedures of the Old World for\r\nguidance in the matter of titles. To be sure, the Constitution not only\r\ndeclared that no titles of nobility shall be granted by the United\r\nStates but that employès of the Government, of whatever degree, shall\r\nnot accept them from any foreign potentate. Yet there was a large\r\nquestion as to what kind of title might have been meant; whether a\r\npatent of nobility with landed estates to be handed down from generation\r\nto generation—which, undoubtedly, was the “evil” aimed at by the framers\r\nof the Constitution—or a mere title of courtesy as “Mister” or “Mr.” or\r\n“Sir” used in ordinary correspondence. Congress had met to put the\r\nConstitution in operation and had the power to construe doubtful\r\npassages. Broader interpretations of the articles have been made than\r\nthose proposed by the titleists.\r\n\r\nAdams had spent much time in Europe and had been impressed with the\r\neffect of formalities, titles, wigs, gowns, etc., on the “common”\r\npeople. That he was correct, in some degree, in his advocacy of these\r\nforms is attested by the fact that gowns have come more and more into\r\nuse in the administration of the judiciary of some states and in the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States while, in the general run of\r\ncommerce, liveries—the insignia of station or rank—are getting to be the\r\nrule rather than the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n                      FORCING THE FIGHT ON TITLES.\r\n\r\nActing with his usual energy, Adams forced the fighting on titles from\r\nthe start. He arrived in New York on Monday, April 20, and by Thursday,\r\nApril 23, he had the Title Committee appointed; and the discussion of\r\ntitles occupied most of the time of the Senate from then until May 14,\r\nwhen it was finally disposed of. Pending the inaugural, April 30, the\r\nsubject lay in abeyance. On the morning following, May 1, the Senate met\r\nat 11 o’clock. At the conclusion of “prayers” was the reading of the\r\nminutes and almost the first words were “His Most Gracious\r\nSpeech”—referring to Washington’s inaugural address. Adams frankly\r\nadmitted that these words had been inserted at his instance by Samuel\r\nOtis, the secretary of the Senate.\r\n\r\nMaclay records: “I looked all around the Senate. Every countenance\r\nseemed to wear a blank. The Secretary was going on. I must speak or\r\nnobody would. ‘Mr. President, we have lately had a hard struggle for our\r\nliberty against kingly authority. The minds of men are still heated;\r\neverything related to that species of government is odious to the\r\npeople. The words prefixed to the President’s speech are the same that\r\nare usually placed before the speech of his Britannic Majesty. I know\r\nthey will give offense. I consider them improper. I, therefore, move\r\nthat they be struck out and that it stand simply address or speech as\r\nmay be adjudged most suitable.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Adams rose in his chair and expressed the greatest surprise that\r\nanything should be objected to on account of its being taken from the\r\npractice of that Government under which we had lived so long and happily\r\nformerly; that he was for a dignified and respectable government and, as\r\nfar as he knew the sentiments of the people, they thought as he did;\r\nthat, for his part, he was one of the first in the late contest [the\r\nRevolution] and, if he could have thought of this, he never would have\r\ndrawn his sword.\r\n\r\n“Painful as it was, I had to contend with the Chair. I admitted that the\r\npeople of the colonies had enjoyed, formerly, great happiness under that\r\nspecies of government but the abuses of that Government under which they\r\nhad smarted had taught them what they had to fear from that kind of\r\ngovernment; that there had been a revolution in the sentiments of people\r\nrespecting that government, equally great as that which had happened in\r\nthe government itself; that even the modes of it were now abhorred; that\r\nthe enemies of the Constitution had objected to it believing there would\r\nbe a transition from it to kingly government and all the trappings and\r\nsplendor of royalty; that if such a thing as this appeared on our\r\nminutes, they would not fail to resent it as the first step of the\r\nladder in the ascent to royalty.\r\n\r\n“The Vice-President rose a second time and declared that he had\r\nmentioned it to the Secretary; that he could not possibly conceive that\r\nany person could take offense at it. I had to get up again and declare\r\nthat, although I knew of it being mentioned from the Chair, yet my\r\nopposition did not proceed from any motive of contempt; that, although\r\nit was a painful task, it was solely a sense of duty that raised me.\r\n\r\n“The Vice-President stood during this time; said he had been long abroad\r\nand did not know how the temper of people might be now. Up now rose\r\n[George] Reed [Senator from Delaware] and declared for the paragraph. He\r\nsaw no reason to object to it because the British speeches were styled\r\n‘most gracious.’ If we choose to object to words because they had been\r\nused in the same sense in Britain, we should soon be at loss to do\r\nbusiness. I had to reply: ‘It is time enough to submit to necessity when\r\nit exists. At present we are not at loss for words. The words, speech or\r\naddress, without any addition will suit us well enough.’ The first time\r\nI was up Mr. Lee followed me with a word or two by way of seconding me;\r\nbut when the Vice-President, on being up last, declared that he was the\r\nperson from whom the words were taken, Mr. Lee got up and informed the\r\nChair that he did not know that circumstance as he had been absent when\r\nit happened. The question was put and carried for erasing the words\r\nwithout a division.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n                            ADAMS EXPLAINS.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of the Senate that day the Vice-President drew\r\nMaclay aside and explained that he was for an efficient government, that\r\nhe had the greatest respect for the President; and gave his ideas on\r\n“checks to government and the balances of power.” Maclay protested that\r\nhe “would yield to no person in respect to General Washington,” that he\r\nwas not wanting in respect to Adams himself; that his wishes for an\r\nefficient government were as high as any man’s and begged “him to\r\nbelieve that I did myself great violence when I opposed him in the chair\r\nand nothing but a sense of duty could force me to it.”\r\n\r\nCommenting on this day’s debate Maclay records: “Strange, indeed, that\r\nin that very country [America] where the flame of freedom had been\r\nkindled, an attempt should be made to introduce these absurdities and\r\nhumiliating distinctions which the hand of reason, aided by our example\r\nwas prostrating in the heart of Europe. I, however, will endeavor (as I\r\nhave hitherto done) to use the resentment of the Representatives to\r\ndefeat Mr. Adams and others on the subject of titles. The pompous and\r\nlordly distinctions which the Senate have manifested a disposition to\r\nestablish between the two Houses have nettled the Representatives and\r\nthis business of titles may be considered as a part of the same tune.\r\nWhile we are debating on titles I will, through the Speaker, Mr.\r\nMuhlenberg and other friends, get the idea suggested of answering the\r\nPresident’s address without any title, in contempt of our deliberations,\r\nwhich still continue on that subject. This, once effected, will confound\r\nthem [the Senators] completely and establish a precedent they will not\r\ndare to violate.”\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, May 2, the day following the debate on “His Most Gracious\r\nSpeech,” the Senate met and several of the members congratulated Maclay\r\non the stand he had taken. Langdon “shook hands very heartily with me,”\r\nbut some of the other New England Senators were “shy.” Senator William\r\nPaterson of New Jersey “passed censure on the conduct of the\r\nVice-President” and “hinted as if some of the Senate would have taken\r\nnotice of the ‘gracious’ affair if I had not. I told him I was no\r\ncourtier and had no occasion to trim, but said it was a most\r\ndisagreeable thing to contend with the Chair and I had alone held that\r\ndisagreeable post more than once.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII.\r\n                          POLITICS AND TITLES.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, May 8, on motion of Ellsworth, the report of the Joint\r\nCommittee on Titles was taken up by the Senate and the great battle was\r\nfairly under way. Two days before this Maclay noted that “the title\r\nselected from all the potentates of the earth for our President was to\r\nhave been taken from Poland, viz., ‘Elective Majesty.’ What a royal\r\nescape!”\r\n\r\nSurprise, naturally, might be expressed that Lee, elected as a\r\n“Republican enemy to an aristocratic constitution,” should have taken\r\nthe lead in advocating titles. Light is thrown on the situation from the\r\nfollowing entry in Maclay’s journal under date of May 15, 1789: “Lee has\r\na cultivated understanding, great practice in public business.... He has\r\nacted as a high priest through the whole of this idolatrous business....\r\nHad it not been for Mr. Lee I am firmly convinced no other man would\r\nhave ventured to follow our Vice-President. But Lee led, Ellsworth\r\nseconded him, the New England men followed and Ralph Izard [Senator from\r\nSouth Carolina] joined them but really _haud passibus aequis_, for he\r\nwas only for the title of ‘Excellency,’ which had been sanctified by\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  UNITED STATES SENATOR ROBERT JACKSON GAMBLE.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society\r\n\r\n  for South Dakota.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“It is easy to see what his [Lee’s] aim is. By flattering the President\r\nof the Senate he hopes to govern all the members from New England and\r\nwith a little assistance from Carolina or Georgia, to be absolute in the\r\nSenate. Ellsworth and some more of the New England men flatter him in\r\nturn, expecting he will be with them on the question of residence [of\r\nCongress]. Had it not been for our Vice-President and Lee I am convinced\r\nthe Senate would have been as adverse to titles as the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The game that our Vice-President and Mr. Lee appear to\r\nhave now in view is to separate the Senate as much as possible from the\r\nHouse of Representatives. Our Vice-President’s doctrine is that all\r\nhonors and titles should flow from the President and Senate only.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n                    THE GREAT DEBATE OF MAY 8, 1789.\r\n\r\nBut whatever Lee’s motives may have been, it is indisputable that he\r\nthrew his great weight and splendid abilities in favor of titles. In the\r\nmomentous debate of May 8 he declared that all the world, civilized and\r\nsavage, called for titles; that there must be something in human nature\r\nthat occasioned this general consent and, therefore, he conceived it was\r\nright. “Here he began,” records Maclay, “to enumerate many, many nations\r\nwho gave titles—such as Venice, Genoa and others. The Greeks and Romans,\r\nit was said, had no titles, ‘but’ (making a profound bow to the Chair)\r\n‘you were pleased to set us right in this with respect to the Conscript\r\nFathers the other day.’ Here he repeated the Vice-President’s speech of\r\nthe 23d ultimo almost verbatim all over.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ellsworth rose. He had a paper in his hat which he looked\r\nconstantly at. He repeated almost all that Mr. Lee had said but got on\r\nthe subject of kings—declared that the sentence in the primer of _fear\r\nGod and honor the king_ was of great importance; that kings were of\r\ndivine appointment; that Saul, the head and shoulders taller than the\r\nrest of the people, was elected by God and anointed by his appointment.\r\n\r\n“I sat after he had done for a considerable time to see if anybody would\r\nrise. At last I got up and first answered Lee as well as I could with\r\nnearly the same arguments, drawn from the Constitution, as I had used on\r\nthe 23d ult. I mentioned that within the space of twenty years back,\r\nmore light had been thrown on the subject of governments and on human\r\naffairs in general than for several generations before; that this light\r\nof knowledge had diminished the veneration for titles and that mankind\r\nnow considered themselves as little bound to imitate the follies of\r\ncivilized nations as the brutalities of savages; that the abuse of power\r\nand the fear of bloody masters had extorted titles as well as adoration,\r\nin some instances from the trembling crowd; that the impression now on\r\nthe minds of the citizens of these states was that of horror for kingly\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n“Izard got up. He dwelt almost entirely on the antiquity of kingly\r\ngovernment. He could not, however, well get farther back than Philip of\r\nMacedon. He seemed to have forgot both Homer and the Bible. He urged for\r\nsomething equivalent to nobility having been common among the Romans,\r\nfor they had three names that seemed to answer to honorable or something\r\nlike it, before and something behind. He did not say Esquire. Mr.\r\nCarroll rose and took my side of the question. He followed nearly the\r\ntrack I had been in and dwelt much on the information that was now\r\nabroad in the world. He spoke against kings.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lee and Mr. Izard were both up again. Ellsworth was up again.\r\nLangdon was up several times but spoke short each time. Paterson was up\r\nbut there was no knowing which side he was of. Mr. Lee considered him as\r\nagainst him and answered him—but Paterson finally voted with Lee. The\r\nVice-President repeatedly helped the speakers for titles. Ellsworth was\r\nenumerating how common the appellation of President was. The\r\nVice-President put him in mind that there were presidents of fire\r\ncompanies and of a cricket club. Mr. Lee, at another time, was saying he\r\nbelieved some of the states authorized titles by their constitutions.\r\nThe Vice-President, from the chair, told him that Connecticut did it. At\r\nsundry other times he interfered in a like manner. I had been frequently\r\nup to answer new points during the debate.\r\n\r\n“I collected myself for a last effort. I read the clause in the\r\nConstitution against titles of nobility; showed that the spirit of it\r\nwas against not only granting titles by Congress but against the\r\npermission to foreign potentates granting _any titles whatever_; that as\r\nto kingly government, it was equally out of the question as a republican\r\ngovernment was guaranteed to every State in the Union; that they were\r\nboth equally forbidden fruit of the Constitution. I called the attention\r\nof the House to the consequences that were likely to follow; that\r\ngentleman seemed to court a rupture with the Lower House. The\r\nRepresentatives had adopted the report [rejecting titles] and were this\r\nday acting on it or according to the spirit of the report. We were\r\nproposing a title. Our conduct would mark us to the world as actuated by\r\nthe spirit of dissension; and the characters of the [two] Houses would\r\nbe as aristocratic and democratical.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX.\r\n                        “HIS ELECTIVE HIGHNESS.”\r\n\r\nFinally the matter came to a vote and the report of the Title Committee,\r\nconferring the title of “Elective Majesty” on Washington was rejected.\r\nThen began the fight, for, at least, some kind of a title for the\r\nPresident. Izard moved for the title of “Excellency,” but he withdrew\r\nit, upon which Lee suggested “Highness” with some prefatory word such as\r\n“Elective Highness.” Maclay records: “It was insisted that such a\r\ndignified title would add greatly to the weight and authority of the\r\nGovernment, both at home and abroad. I declared myself of a totally\r\ndifferent opinion; that at present it was impossible to add to the\r\nrespect entertained for General Washington; that if you gave him the\r\ntitle of any foreign prince or potentate, a belief would follow that the\r\nmanners of that prince and his modes of government would be adopted by\r\nthe President. (Mr. Lee had, just before I got up, read over a list of\r\nthe titles of all the princes and potentates of the earth, marking where\r\nthe word ‘highness’ occurred. The Grand Turk had it, all the crown\r\nprinces of Germany had it, sons and daughters of crown heads, etc.) That\r\nparticularly ‘Elective Highness,’ which sounded nearly like ‘Electoral\r\nHighness,’ would have a most ungrateful sound to many thousands of\r\nindustrious citizens who had fled from German oppression; that\r\n‘Highness’ was part of the title of a prince or princess of the blood\r\nand was often given to dukes; that it was degrading our President to\r\nplace him on a par with any prince of any blood in Europe, nor was there\r\none of them that could enter the list of true glory with him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X.\r\n                           “ROYAL ETIQUETTE.”\r\n\r\nThis debate, beginning probably at the usual time for the Senate’s\r\nmeeting, namely 10 a. m., lasted until 3.30 p. m., by which time another\r\ncommittee was appointed to consider a title for the President.\r\nConcluding his record of the notable debate of this day, Maclay writes:\r\n“This whole silly business is the work of Mr. Adams and Mr. Lee. Izard\r\nfollows Lee and the New England men ... follow Mr. Adams. Mr. [Charles]\r\nThompson [Secretary of the old Congress] says this used to be the case\r\nin the old Congress. I had, to be sure, the greatest share in this\r\ndebate and must now have completely sold (no, sold is a bad word for I\r\nhave got nothing for it) every particle of court favor, for a court our\r\nHouse seems determined on, and to run into all the fooleries, fopperies,\r\nfineries and pomp of royal etiquette.”\r\n\r\nWhen Maclay attended the Senate on the following day, Saturday, May 9,\r\nhe notes: “I know not the motive but never was I received with more\r\nfamiliarity, nor quite so much, before by the members. Ellsworth, in\r\nparticular, seemed to show a kind of fondness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XI.\r\n                        DEFEAT OF THE TITLEISTS.\r\n\r\nAfter correcting the minutes, the Title Committee, appointed by the\r\nSenate on the day before, reported “His Highness, the President of the\r\nUnited States of America, and Protector of the Rights of the Same” for\r\nWashington. Senator William Few, of Georgia, spoke to Maclay, intimating\r\nhis unwillingness to do anything hastily. He then addressed the Senate\r\non the same lines, although he did not pointedly move for postponement.\r\nMeantime the clerk of the House of Representatives appeared at the bar\r\nand announced the adoption of the report of the Joint Committee, which\r\nrejected all titles.\r\n\r\nAt this point Maclay got up, said that what Few had said amounted to a\r\nmotion for a postponement and asked leave to second him. “I then pointed\r\nout,” records Maclay, “the rupture that was likely to ensue with the\r\nother House; that this was a matter of very serious import and I thought\r\nit our indispensable duty to avoid any inconvenience of that kind; that\r\nby the arrangement between the Houses, in case of disagreement, a\r\nconference might be requested; that my intention was, if the\r\npostponement was carried, to move immediately for a Committee of\r\nConference to be appointed on the differences between the Houses and I\r\nhad hopes that by these means all subjects of debate would be done\r\naway.”\r\n\r\nNow Reed moved that the report might be adopted but he was not seconded.\r\nSenator Caleb Strong [of Massachusetts] was in favor of the postponement\r\nbut was interrupted by the Chair. Senator [Tristram] Dalton [of\r\nMassachusetts] also was in favor of it and Maclay records: “I could now\r\nsee a visible anxiety in the Chair. Strong was up again and said among\r\nother things that he thought the other House would follow—but there was\r\nrisk in it.”\r\n\r\nEvidently the tide began to turn against titles, for Maclay records: “I\r\nhad a fine, slack and easy time of it today. Friends seemed to rise in\r\nsuccession. Lee went over his old ground twice but owned, at last, that\r\nthere was difficulty every way but said plainly that the best mode for\r\nthe House was to adopt the [Senate] report—and then the other House\r\nwould follow. He found, however, the current began to turn against him\r\nand he laid his head on his hands as if he would have slept.”\r\n\r\nFinally Izard got up and said that he was in favor of a postponement. “I\r\ncould see the Vice-President kindle at him,” records Maclay. “Izard had\r\nremarked that the House of Representatives had adopted the report\r\nrejecting titles but the Chair interrupted him, saying: ‘No, we had no\r\nright to know, nor could we know it until after the clerk had this\r\nmorning official information.’ The members fixed themselves and the\r\nquestion was called for.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII.\r\n                   “WHAT WILL THE COMMON PEOPLE SAY.”\r\n\r\nAt this point Adams got up and for forty minutes addressed the Senate.\r\nMaclay writes: “He began first on the subject of order and found fault\r\nwith everything almost; but down he came to particulars and pointedly\r\nblamed a member for disorderly behavior. The member had mentioned the\r\nappearance of a captious disposition in the other House. This was\r\ndisorderly and he spoke with asperity. The member meant was Mr. Izard.\r\nAll this was prefatory. On he got to his favorite topic of titles and\r\nover the old ground of the immense advantage of, the absolute necessity\r\nof them. When he had exhausted this subject he turned a new leaf, I\r\nbelieve, on the conviction that the postponement would be carried and,\r\nperhaps, the business lost by an attention to the other House.\r\n\r\n“‘Gentlemen’ [said Adams], I must tell you that it is you and the\r\nPresident that have the making of titles. Suppose the President to have\r\nthe appointment of Mr. Jefferson at the court of France. Mr. Jefferson\r\nis, in virtue of that appointment, the most illustrious, the most\r\npowerful and what not. But the President must be himself something that\r\nincludes all the dignities of the diplomatic corps and something greater\r\nstill. What will the common people of foreign countries, what will the\r\nsailors and the soldiers say, ‘George Washington, President of the\r\nUnited States?’ They will despise him _to all eternity_. This is all\r\nnonsense to the philosopher—but so is all government whatever.’\r\n\r\n“The above I recollect with great precision; but he said fifty more\r\nthings equally injudicious which I do not think worth minuting. It is\r\nevident that he begins to despair of getting the article of titles\r\nthrough the House of Representatives and has turned his eye to get it\r\ndone solely by the Senate.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XIII.\r\n                  “HIGH-SOUNDING POMPOUS APPELLATION.”\r\n\r\nMaclay had intended saying not another word on this subject for this\r\nday, but some remarks in the Vice-President’s speech impelled the\r\nPennsylvanian to rise. He said: “Mr. President, the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States has designated our Chief Magistrate by the appellation of\r\nthe ‘President of the United States of America.’ This is his title of\r\noffice; nor can we alter, add to or diminish it without infringing the\r\nConstitution. In like manner persons authorized to transact business\r\nwith foreign powers are styled Ambassadors, Public Ministers, etc. To\r\ngive them any other appellation would be an equal infringement. As to\r\ngrades of order or titles of nobility, nothing of the kind can be\r\nestablished by Congress.\r\n\r\n“Can, then, the President and Senate do that which is prohibited to the\r\nUnited States at large? Certainly not. Let us read the Constitution. ‘No\r\ntitle of nobility shall be granted by the United States.’ The\r\nConstitution goes further. The servants of the public are prohibited\r\nfrom accepting them from any foreign state, king or prince. So that the\r\nappellation and terms given to nobility in the Old World are contraband\r\nlanguage in the United States; nor can we apply them to our citizens\r\nconsistent with the Constitution. As to what the common people, soldiers\r\nand sailors of foreign countries may think of us, I do not think it\r\nimports us much. Perhaps, the less they think or have occasion to think\r\nof us, the better.\r\n\r\n“But suppose this is a desirable point; how is it to be gained? The\r\nEnglish excepted, foreigners do not understand our language. We must use\r\nHohen Mogende to a Dutchman, Beylerbey to a Turk or Algerine and so of\r\nthe rest. From the English, indeed, we may borrow terms that would not\r\nbe wholly unintelligible to our own citizens. But will they thank us for\r\nthe compliment? Would not the plagiarism be more likely to be attended\r\nwith contempt than respect among all of them? It has been admitted that\r\nall this is nonsense to the philosopher. I am ready to admit that every\r\nhigh-sounding, pompous appellation, descriptive of qualities which the\r\nobject does not possess, must appear bombastic nonsense in the eye of\r\nevery wise man. But I cannot admit such an idea with respect to\r\ngovernment itself. Philosophers have admitted not the utility but the\r\nnecessity of it and their labors have been directed to correct the vices\r\nand expose the follies which have been engrafted upon it and to reduce\r\nthe practice of it to the principles of common sense, such as we see\r\nexemplified by the merchant, the mechanic and the farmer whose every act\r\nor operation tends to a productive or beneficial effect; and, above all,\r\nto illustrate this fact that government was instituted for the benefit\r\nof the people and that no act of government is justifiable that has not\r\nthis for its object. Such has been the labor of philosophers with\r\nrespect to government and sorry indeed would I be if their labors should\r\nbe in vain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV.\r\n                      “AFFECTATION OF SIMPLICITY.”\r\n\r\nVice-President Adams now put the question and the postponement was\r\ncarried; immediately after which Maclay offered a resolution for a\r\nconference between the two Houses. It was carried and the committee\r\nappointed. But now Ellsworth drew up another resolution in which the\r\ndifferences between the two Houses were to be kept out of sight and to\r\nproceed _de novo_ on a title for the President. “I did not enter into\r\nthe debate,” records Maclay, “but expressed my fear that the House of\r\nRepresentatives would be irritated and would not meet us on that ground.\r\nAnd, as if they meant to provoke the other House, they insisted that the\r\nminute of rejection should go down with the appointment of the\r\ncommittee. Little good can come of it thus circumstanced, more\r\nespecially as the old committee were reappointed,” namely, Ellsworth,\r\nJohnson and Lee.\r\n\r\nMonday, May 11, on motion of Lee, the subject of titles was postponed to\r\nthe following day, but under date of May 12 Maclay records: “The\r\nbusiness of considering the title, which was laid on the table, was\r\npostponed to see what would be the result of the conference of the Joint\r\nCommittee on that subject.” Adams’s solicitude for titles was evident,\r\nfor when the Senate met, May 13, he reminded the members that the report\r\nfor the President’s title lay on the table. The Senate was informed by\r\nLee that the committee on titles had met in the Senate chamber but were\r\ninterrupted by the assembling of that body and had agreed to meet on the\r\nfollowing morning. Again, on May 14, the Vice-President “reminded us of\r\nthe title report” but the committee was out on it. In a short time,\r\nhowever, they reported that the Lower House “had adhered in the\r\nstrictest manner to their former resolution,” which was against the\r\ngranting of titles of any kind.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was a heavy blow for the advocates of titles. Catching at\r\nthe last straw, Lee now moved that the Senate _de novo committee’s_\r\nreport in favor of titles be taken from the table and entered on the\r\nfiles of the House. The spirit of his motion was that attention should\r\nbe paid to the usages of civilized nations in order to keep up a proper\r\nrespect to the President; that “affectation of simplicity would be\r\ninjurious”; that the Senate had decided in favor of titles but, in\r\ndeference to the expressed feelings of the Lower House, the Senate, “for\r\nthe present,” should address the President without title.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XV.\r\n                     “YOUR HIGHNESS OF THE SENATE.”\r\n\r\nOn the day preceding this debate the Speaker Muhlenberg of the House of\r\nRepresentatives had accosted Maclay as “Your Highness of the Senate,”\r\nsaying that Congressman Henry Wynkoop, of Pennsylvania, had been\r\nchristened by them “His Highness of the Lower House.” As the question of\r\ntitles was gone all over again, Maclay records that he determined to try\r\nwhat ridicule would do. He said: “Mr. President, if all men were of one\r\nstature, there would be neither high nor low. Highness, when applied to\r\nan individual, must naturally denote the excess of stature which he\r\npossesses over other men. An honorable member [Ellsworth] told us the\r\nother day of a certain king [Saul] who was a head and shoulders taller\r\nthan anybody else. This, more especially when he was gloriously greased\r\nwith a great horn of oil, must have rendered him _highly_ conspicuous.\r\nHistory, too, if I mistake not, will furnish us with an example where a\r\ngreat Thracian obtained the empire of the world from no other\r\ncircumstance. But, if this antiquated principle is to be adopted, give\r\nus fair play. Let America be searched and it is most probable that the\r\nhonor will be found to belong to some huge Patagonian. This is indeed\r\nputting one sadly over the head of another. True, but Nature has done it\r\nand men should see where she leads before they adopt her as a guide.\r\n\r\n“It may be said that this business is metaphorical and the high station\r\nof the President entitled him to it. Nothing can be true metaphorically\r\nwhich is not so naturally, and under this view of the proposed title it\r\nbelongs with more propriety to the man in the moon than anybody else as\r\nhis station (when we have the honor of seeing him) is certainly the most\r\nexalted of any we know of. Gentlemen may say this is fanciful. Would\r\nthey wish to see the subject in the most serious point of view that it\r\nis possible to place it? Rome, after being benighted for ages in the\r\ndarkest gloom of ecclesiastical and aristocratic tyranny, beheld a\r\nreformer [Rienzi] in the fourteenth century who, preaching from stocks\r\nand stones and the busts and fragments of ancient heroes, lighted up the\r\nlamp of liberty to meridium splendor. Intoxicated with success, he\r\nassumed a string of titles, none of which, in my recollection, was\r\nequally absurd with the one before you; in consequence of which and of\r\nhis aping some other symbols of nobility and royalty, he fell and pulled\r\ndown the whole republican structure along with him; marking particularly\r\nthe subject of titles as one of the principal rocks on which he was\r\nshipwrecked. As to the latter part of the title, I would only observe\r\nthat the power of war is the organ of protection. This is placed in\r\nCongress by the Constitution. Any attempt to divest them of it, even\r\nwith George Washington, is treason against the United States or, at\r\nleast, a violation of the Constitution.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI.\r\n                         SENATE FAVORS TITLES.\r\n\r\nWith a view to “cutting up the whole matter by the roots” the\r\nanti-titleists moved a general postponement of the Senate report on\r\ntitles—and the motion was carried. But with a tenacity worthy of a\r\nbetter cause, Lee insisted on placing the report on the files of the\r\nHouse as indicating that the Senate was in favor of titles. Carroll\r\nopposed this on the ground that an imperfect resolution should not be\r\nfiled. He was seconded by Maclay as the filing carried with it the idea\r\nof adoption. This part of the motion was lost by a general postponement.\r\n\r\nEven after the subject had been postponed, the Senators persisted in the\r\ndiscussion. Morris rose and said that he disliked the title “Highness\r\nand Protector of the Rights of America” as protection lay with Congress.\r\nHe was told that the question of postponement had been carried. Then\r\nCarroll rose, said he disliked the first part of the motion which stated\r\nthe acts of the Senate to be in favor of titles. But, as a matter of\r\nfact, no such resolution had been passed in the Senate.\r\n\r\nMaclay then rose and moved a division on the motion and was seconded by\r\nCarroll. This precipitated another long debate on titles. Ellsworth went\r\nover the field again; Johnson “spoke much more to the point, Paterson\r\nsaid that a division should take place at the word ‘Senate’ and on this\r\npoint he was supported by Morris and Maclay, the latter withdrawing his\r\nmotion and seconding Paterson’s for a division at the word ‘Senate.’ The\r\ndivision was full enough to answer all purposes which they avowed,\r\ntaking it at this place.” It was apparent, however, that the titleists\r\nstill clung to their hope and even went so far as to charge the Lower\r\nHouse with affecting simplicity.\r\n\r\nCarroll declared that it was well known that all the Senators were not\r\nfor titles, yet the idea held forth was that the Senate favored titles.\r\nHe wished to have the yeas and nays placed on record and “let the world\r\njudge.” Senator Few said that it was too late for the yeas and nays as\r\nthey should have been called for when the report against titles was\r\nrejected. Finally the question was put and it stood “eight with us; ten\r\nagainst us. Mr. Carroll called for the yeas and nays.” None rose with\r\nhim except Senator John Henry of Maryland and Maclay “and for want of\r\nanother man we lost them”—Rule 15 of the Senate holding that the yeas\r\nand nays can be placed on the journal of the House only when called for\r\nby one-fifth of the senators present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVII.\r\n                         WASHINGTON’S ATTITUDE.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to note Washington’s bearing on the subject of\r\ntitles while it was under debate in Congress. His position was most\r\nembarrassing and called for tact and equanimity as the first title\r\nconsidered was that for the President. On its fate depended the granting\r\nof titles for the lesser officers of the government. That Washington\r\nconducted himself with his usual fortitude, impartiality and\r\nbroad-mindedness is fully attested by the following entry in Maclay’s\r\njournal: “Through the whole of this base business [granting titles] I\r\nhave endeavored to mark the conduct of General Washington. I have no\r\nclew that will fairly lead me to any just conclusion as to his\r\nsentiments. I think it scarce possible but he must have dropped\r\nsomething on a subject which has excited so much warmth. If he did, it\r\nwas not on our side or I would have heard it. But no matter. I have, by\r\nplowing with the heifer of the other House, completely defeated them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVIII.\r\n                      NO TITLES “FOR THE PRESENT.”\r\n\r\nAnd so ended the momentous debate in the first United States Senate on\r\nthe subject of titles which, in one form or another, “engaged almost the\r\nwhole time of the Senate from the 23d of April, the day that our\r\nVice-President began it,” until May 14 when the Senate, by a vote of ten\r\nto eight decided that they, “for the present,” would not press the\r\nsubject of titles but so arranged the records as to give the impression\r\nthat they sanctioned them. When it came to reading the minutes on the\r\nfollowing day, Friday, May 15, Few moved that the minute on the division\r\nof Lee’s motion be struck out because, as it stood, it had the\r\nappearance of unanimity. Lee opposed. Few was supported by Carroll,\r\nEllsworth and Maclay—but the minute stood.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and eighteen years have lapsed since this debate on a title\r\nfor the President of the United States—and the consequent “ennobling” of\r\nthe lesser officials of the “new” government—took place. That debate\r\nleft the situation as follows: the House of Representatives rejected\r\ntitles of any kind most positively. The Senate, finding that it could\r\nnot bring the whole Congress to the point of giving titles, fell back to\r\nthe position that the President and the Senate were the only fountain\r\nheads of titles and that, merely as a matter of accommodation, “for the\r\npresent” they waived the question but put themselves on record—by\r\nplacing on the files of the Senate a resolution which never was\r\npassed—as being in favor of appellations of nobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH PIONEERS OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY—JOHN WOOD, THE FIRST REAL\r\n      PIONEER SETTLER—FOUNDER OF QUINCY, MODEL STATE EXECUTIVE AND\r\n               PATRIOT—HEROIC SETTLERS IN VARIOUS STATES.\r\n\r\n                  BY MR. MICHAEL PIGGOTT, QUINCY, ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter many thousand years separation at the cradle of their race, in\r\nIndia, it was the coming together and blending of pure Celtic and\r\nTeutonic families that finally gave order and civilization to Europe\r\nafter the fall of Greece and Rome produced the dark ages. It was the\r\nfurther mingling and blending of the same kindred blood in America that\r\nproduced the men, who, in 1776, gave the governments and civilizations\r\nof the world their brightest jewel in the Declaration of American\r\nIndependence, a new civic chart to inspire and guide all nations on the\r\nhighway of justice, freedom and equality to the highest civilization. It\r\nwas a further blend of the same virile and liberty-loving blood that\r\nenabled the immortal Lincoln to save the Republic in 1861 and place it\r\nat the head of the nations, without a peer in ancient or modern history.\r\n\r\nIt was the marriage of an Irishman and a German woman in the Mohawk\r\nValley of New York in 1795 that gave America, in the person of John\r\nWood, one of her best and bravest sons; the Mississippi Valley, its\r\nfirst real pioneer settler; Quincy, its beloved founder; Illinois, a\r\nmodel executive and the republic a patriotic defender.\r\n\r\nGovernor John Wood was born in Moravia, New York, December 20th, 1798.\r\nHe was the second child and only son of Doctor Daniel Wood, and\r\nCatherine (Crouse) Wood. His father, a surgeon and captain under\r\nWashington during the war of freedom from British despotism, was of\r\nIrish descent, being the grandson of Timothy Wood, of Longford, Ireland.\r\n\r\nDoctor Daniel Wood was a man of unusual attainments as a scholar and\r\nlinguist. He was proficient in several languages; his medical books in\r\nFrench and German, with his own marginal notes, indicate the high\r\nstandard of his professional acquirements.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the revolution, he settled in Cayuga County, on a large\r\ntract of land which he received as a bounty from the government, where\r\nhe died at the ripe age of ninety-two years. His body was exhumed by his\r\nson and brought to Quincy and buried in Woodland Cemetery on a high\r\nnatural knoll overlooking the waters of the Mississippi, in view of\r\nGeorge Rogers Clark’s monument, designed by a son of General Mulligan\r\nand erected by the State of Illinois during the past year. Irish\r\npatriotism and valor are here well represented by the names of Clark,\r\nWood and Mulligan.\r\n\r\nThe mother of Governor Wood, who died while he was under five years of\r\nage, was a woman of unusual beauty and was several years younger than\r\nher husband. She was of old “Mohawk Dutch” stock, and while well\r\ninformed could only speak the “Dutch” language.\r\n\r\nIn 1818, John Wood came West in quest of home and fortune. He spent two\r\nyears exploring the advantages offered to young men in the valleys of\r\nKentucky, Tennessee and Alabama, also in southern Ohio and Indiana. In\r\n1820, while at Cincinnati, he met a young man by the name of Willard\r\nKeyes, a native of Vermont and two years older than himself. Keyes had\r\nspent a year at Prairie du Chien, on the Upper Mississippi, teaching\r\nFrench and Indian half-breeds. They entered into a partnership to go on\r\nthe frontier and commence farming. They secured between them some young\r\nsteers, a heifer and a few swine, a plow and a limited supply of\r\nprovisions, then treked across the country into the wilderness of the\r\ngreat Northwest to find a suitable location, finally stopping at a place\r\nabout thirty miles southeast of Quincy, where they established a rude\r\nbachelors’ hall and raised three crops.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1821, Wood, while hunting for game, met two Irishmen\r\nnamed Peter Flynn and James Moffatt, soldiers of 1812, who had located\r\ngovernment warrants on the banks of the Mississippi, west of the Wood\r\nand Keyes locations. John Wood visited the Flynn and Moffatt locations\r\nand, being a keen observer and a natural lover of beauty, admiring their\r\nhigh advantages and beautiful surroundings, immediately resolved to make\r\nhis home with them.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of that year, Jeremiah Rose, wife and five-year-old daughter\r\ncame to the Wood and Keyes settlement. He was of Irish descent, born in\r\nRensselear County, New York. In the fall of 1822, Wood and Rose arranged\r\nto locate at the Flynn and Moffatt settlements, but Rose took sick and\r\nremained with his family, while Wood went on, and with the assistance of\r\nFlynn and Moffatt built a log cabin eighteen by twenty feet, the first\r\nwhite man’s home in this section of Illinois, as Flynn and Moffatt had\r\nbuilt no cabins on their locations but camped with the Indians who lined\r\nthe river banks north and south for several miles. John Wood being\r\nunmarried, the Rose family occupied his cabin and remained with him\r\nuntil 1826, when Rose located a mile back from the river and about a\r\nmile north, on what is now known as Twelfth Street.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1824, Williard Keyes came and built a cabin sixteen by\r\nsixteen feet at the foot of what is now Vermont Street. In the same\r\nfall, John Drulard, a Frenchman, built a cabin a short distance south of\r\nWood, making a white man’s village of three cabins where Indians had\r\nheld dominion and war dances for ages. Between the cabins of Wood and\r\nKeyes, on the high bluffs where Main Street has been cut through to the\r\nriver, there was a “Sauk” village of friendly Indians. They lingered in\r\nthe vicinity for several years, coming back annually until after the\r\nBlack Hawk war to decorate and worship at the graves of their fathers.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1824, John Wood caused to be inserted in the Edwardsville\r\nSpectator a notice that application would be made at the next session of\r\nthe legislature, for the organization of a new county, defining its\r\nboundaries. In 1825 the Legislature authorized its establishment, fixing\r\nthe boundaries described in Wood’s notice and as they now exist. Three\r\ncommissioners were appointed to locate the county seat. After going over\r\nthe boundaries, they selected the place suggested by John Wood as the\r\nmost suitable. They christened the new town Quincy and the county Adams,\r\nin honor of the president. Thenceforth the little village of three log\r\ncabins rejoiced in a name. A space four hundred feet square was reserved\r\nin the center of the town for a public square, now known as Washington\r\nPark, the home of the friendly squirrels and birds that sport in safety\r\namid its elms, shrubs and fountains. The first election for officers of\r\nthe county was held July 2, 1825, when forty votes were polled.\r\n\r\nFrom 1825 to 1830, the growth of Quincy was very slow, caused by the\r\nprivations incident to a pioneer’s life. The little settlement was many\r\nmiles distant from mills or places where necessary family supplies could\r\nbe obtained. Instead of coffee the settlers used okra seeds, which they\r\ncultivated for that purpose and sweetened with wild honey found in great\r\nabundance in the neighboring woods. Their nearest blacksmith was at\r\nAtlas, forty miles distant, where they carried their plows to be\r\nsharpened, swung upon horses’ backs.\r\n\r\nAmong the voters who took part in the election for county officers in\r\nJuly, 1825, appear the Celtic names of George Frazier, Michael Dodd,\r\nThomas McCreary, Louis Kinney, Daniel Moore, H. Hawley and Ben McNitt,\r\nbesides the others above mentioned. Below appear the names of the Irish\r\npioneers who came after the county and the town were organized.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, John Wood was the moving spirit of the young\r\nsettlement. Its subsequent growth and prosperity were due to his\r\nuntiring zeal which he maintained to the end of his long and useful\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, John Wood visited the lead mines at Galena, but maintained his\r\nhome at Quincy and was constantly identified with its progress, serving\r\nas its mayor four times and a number of years as one of its councilmen.\r\nHis influence was not confined to Quincy alone. He was early recognized\r\nthroughout the State as a rising man of mark. The manner in which he\r\norganized Adams County and defeated a movement of men from Kentucky,\r\nwho, in 1824, desired a convention for a new constitution to allow them\r\nto bring their slaves to Illinois, gave him prominence among the\r\npoliticians of the State.\r\n\r\nAt the time John Wood built his Quincy cabin, St. Louis and Missouri\r\nwere the attractive places of the opening West, but the black gangrene\r\nof human slavery repelled John Wood and caused him to prefer the free\r\nsoil of Illinois. When the question was submitted to the people, John\r\nWood made a canvass of the Bounty Land or Military Tract as it was\r\ncalled, and out of one hundred and three votes cast secured all but four\r\nagainst a change. He regarded with equal disfavor the political\r\norganization known as the abolitionists, considering them civic\r\ndisturbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THOMAS F. RYAN, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  Of New York City.\r\n\r\n  Life Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1832 John Wood served as a volunteer in the Blackhawk War. In 1848,\r\nwith two sons, he went to California, but remained there only a year. In\r\n1850 he was elected to the State Senate and in 1856 was elected\r\nLieutenant Governor of Illinois, and became governor of the State in\r\n1859 on the death of Governor Bissell. He was one of the five delegates\r\nwho, in February, 1861, represented Illinois at the peace convention in\r\nWashington. On the breaking out of the rebellion he was appointed\r\nQuartermaster General of Illinois, and served with great efficiency\r\nuntil June, 1864, when, at the age of sixty-six years, he went to the\r\nfield of war as Colonel of the One Hundredth and Thirty-Seventh\r\nIllinois. At Memphis, Tennessee, he was assigned to the command of a\r\nbrigade and discharged his duties gallantly while under fire.\r\n\r\nThe value of Governor Wood’s services to State and Nation were\r\nhandsomely acknowledged in 1868 by Illinois’ great war governor, Richard\r\nYates, then United States Senator, in a letter to Governor Wood. Senator\r\nYates wrote: “I have never expressed to you, though I have many times\r\nspoken of it to others, my grateful remembrance of your great assistance\r\nduring those trying times. Often when discouraged, as we all were, I\r\nbelieve, except you, I have been cheered and sustained by your\r\nconfidence and what many persons told me of your kindly mention of my\r\nacts as governor. This, I assure you, my dear Governor, is one of the\r\npleasant memories connected with those eventful and trying times, and it\r\nis not too late, I hope, for me to express my unfeigned gratitude. It\r\nhas always afforded me pleasure, when friends have given me the credit,\r\nto tell them the truth, how vastly the State was indebted to Governor\r\nWood for the great energy he displayed in his office, which was the most\r\ntrying office of us all, and for his warm and enthusiastic words for his\r\ncountry in those days of doubt and trial. I hope you will not consider\r\nthese words flattering, but as a grateful expression of your true\r\nfriend, Richard Yates.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Wood “was a superb specimen of the highest human type; six feet\r\nin height; hair and beard flowing and as white as snow; ruddy face;\r\nstrong cut features; muscular frame and a pleasing dignity gave him the\r\nappearance of a Roman Senator, causing Governor Yates and others to\r\nrefer to him frequently as the “Old Roman from Adams.” His nature was\r\nbold, frank and generous. He was a stranger to moral or physical fear. A\r\nfew years before his death, with his wife, and a party of Quincy\r\nfriends, he visited California. While on a steamer visiting places in\r\nSouthern California, he was wrecked by the boat running on a rock. The\r\nCaptain, after placing women and children safely on boats, said: “Now,\r\nGovernor Wood, you take your place.” His answer was that of a hero.\r\n“Send the young folks first. I am seventy years old. Save the young.””\r\n\r\nBefore 1858, Governor Wood resided in a large two-story frame dwelling\r\nwith pilastered portico, which that year he moved across Twelfth Street\r\ninto his old orchard, and on the old site he erected a magnificent\r\nsandstone palace, the finest then in the State, costing $125,000. It is\r\nnow used as a boy’s school by the Methodist Church, while the old frame\r\ndwelling is owned by the Quincy Historical Society, both, with immense\r\ntracts of land within the city limits, having passed from the Governor\r\nshortly before his death through the unfortunate speculations of his\r\nsons on the Chicago Board of Trade; he surrendered everything to pay\r\ntheir debts.\r\n\r\nHe died in Quincy, June 4th, 1880, full of honor, at the ripe age of\r\neighty-two years, and was buried by the side of his patriotic father in\r\nWoodland Cemetery, on a high knoll facing the magnificent waters of the\r\nMississippi and within four blocks of where he built his log cabin in\r\n1822. Immediately south of Woodland lies Indian Mound Park, and a mile\r\nnorth is Riverview Park, where George Rogers Clark’s monument stands in\r\nrepose with a Continental hat in hand and arms folded, looking out in\r\nadmiration on the lands his valor had saved for American freemen. There\r\nare numerous Indian mounds, both in the cemetery and parks, and they\r\nextend for many miles along the bluffs, North and South of Quincy.\r\n\r\nA life-sized bronze statue of Governor Wood is in Washington Park,\r\nlocated in the business center of the city, erected by the city which he\r\nfounded, nursed through infancy with care to the full maturity of the\r\n“Gem City” of the Mississippi, with a prosperous population of\r\nforty-five thousand intelligent people, whom he honored by a patriotic\r\nand a stainless Christian life.\r\n\r\nBefore the election of Governor Wood, Illinois had three governors of\r\nCeltic descent—Duncan, Carlin and Ford. Both Ford and Carlin, previous\r\nto their election, had resided in Quincy.\r\n\r\nIn 1812, the territory between the Illinois and the Mississippi Rivers,\r\nwas set aside by Congress as a military or bounty land district, wherein\r\nthe soldiers of the War of 1812 might locate their warrants for a one\r\nhundred and sixty-acre land grant as a bounty from the government.\r\nQuincy was made one of the land offices for that purpose, which brought\r\nmany of the ex-soldiers, especially from Tennessee and Kentucky, to\r\nAdams County. The names of those who were Irish, or of Irish descent,\r\nholding warrants issued in 1817 and 1818 and located in Adams County\r\nbefore 1836, were the following: Peter Flynn, James Moffatt, Patrick\r\nNugent, John McDade, David Higgins, John W.

They were the\r\nfollowing: Rev. Fr. Michael Ahern, Richard and William Ahern, James\r\nArthur, Nathaniel, Thomas, Robert and William Benneson, Rev.

The following names are taken from Volume 9, Adjutant\r\nGeneral’s reports of Illinois, published by the State in 1902, giving a\r\ncomplete roster of Illinois officers and enlisted men in the Blackhawk\r\nwar of 1831–2, and the Mexican war of 1846–8, both taken from the\r\nofficial rolls on file in the War Department, Washington, D. C., to show\r\nthe strength of Irish-Americans among the pioneers of the Mississippi\r\nValley in those early days, as well as to show that the race never fails\r\nto respond in large numbers to the war-call of their country in time of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThe following served in the Blackhawk war: John and Daniel Wood, Daniel\r\nHayes, James McCarlin, Thomas Duncan, Bernard Fleming, Thomas Gulley, H.\r\nRiley, Timothy Inghram, John Russell, Thomas Stanly, John, James and\r\nGeorge Karnes, John and James Caldwell, Richard Hogan, Aaron Quigley,\r\nPeter Smith, William Lafferty, James and Jacob L.

The\r\nfirst, second and third were enrolled and mustered as a brigade by Gen.\r\nPhilip Kearny at Alton, men principally from the “Bounty Land” district.\r\nThe general, being the grandson of an Irishman, drew many of that race\r\nto his standard. The following are the names: John W. Burns, William\r\nCassedy, William Finney, Richard Grant, John McCoy, Daniel McNeil, James\r\nRamsey, Patrick Higgins, William A.

Lawler.\r\n\r\nMany of these soldiers became very prominent in the political and social\r\naffairs of the state and nation, especially John Wood, Murry McConnell,\r\nMichael K. Lawler and John A. Logan.\r\n\r\nAfter the Blackhawk war, two militia companies were organized in Quincy,\r\nthe “Quincy Rifles” and the “Montgomery Guards,” the latter principally\r\nIrish, organized and commanded by Timothy Kelley, who was afterwards\r\nkilled at the battle of Buena Vista, Mexico. We were unable to secure a\r\nroster of Captain Kelley’s Militia Company, but from men of his time, we\r\nwere informed that the following were among its members: William Kelley,\r\na brother of Timothy; William Kennedy, James Ryan, James O’Connor, a\r\nveteran of 1812; Thomas Landon, Oliver and William Geary, William\r\nThompson, Thomas Mannix, John Dwyer, Richard Grant, James Dillon, James\r\nSheerin, Michael Corcary, Thomas Leahey, Bernard McDermott, John\r\nMcDaniel, James Clark, Thomas Kenney, Andrew Malone, Daniel Moore, John\r\nSheeney, William Shaw and Thomas Hickey, who still survives at the age\r\nof eighty years, in the Illinois Soldiers and Sailors’ Home at Quincy.\r\nJohn Kelley, a son of William, served honorably in an Ohio regiment\r\nduring the war for the Union.\r\n\r\nThere were several Kelley families in Adams County. Next to the family\r\nof Timothy Kelley, that of Maurice Kelley became the most noted as men\r\nof mark. Maurice Kelley came to Adams County in 1836 with his parents\r\nand settled on a farm in the southeast part of the county. Being\r\ntemperate and industrious, the family prospered. Maurice was elected\r\nsheriff of Adams County in 1860, and as a member of the Legislature in\r\n1870; in 1874 as a state senator, where he served three terms. He was\r\ncollector of internal revenue at Quincy under President Cleveland. He\r\nwas for ten years a supervisor of the county, as was his brother Michael\r\nfrom an adjoining township. Maurice Kelley is still living at Mt.\r\nSterling, Illinois.\r\n\r\nMany of the old pioneers moved off with the human current to California\r\nand other attractive places in the Far West. Only a few of those who\r\nremained in Quincy are still living, but many of their children are\r\namong the leading men of affairs in every branch of business as well as\r\nthe professions in Quincy and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, whole families came together, as will be noticed in\r\nthe list of names given above, as having come before 1840. The most\r\nnoted of them was that of the Rev. William Best, with his five sons and\r\na daughter Charlotte Best Finlay, who with her husband accompanied them.\r\nThe Reverend Best became a prominent minister of the Methodist Episcopal\r\nChurch of Illinois and lived to a ripe old age, to see his family all\r\nsuccessful in worldly affairs. His youngest son Joseph served as\r\nadjutant of the Twenty-first Missouri Infantry in the Union army; the\r\nother sons being over the military age supported the cause at home. His\r\ngrandsons and great grandsons are now among our best business men. A\r\ngrandson, John H. Best, has served as mayor of Quincy and is now\r\npresident of one of our banks, a stockholder and director in nearly\r\nevery corporation doing business here; also a large land owner in\r\nIllinois, Missouri, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, while his brother, Ezra\r\nBest, is president of the Best Plumbing and Steam Heating Company, one\r\nof the largest and most successful in the West. Both brothers coöperate\r\nand invest together. They are model citizens and have the respect and\r\nconfidence of all our people.\r\n\r\nThe Finlay family, Rev. William B., James B., Matthew B., with their\r\nthree sisters, Ann B. Padgett, Jane B. and Mary B. Finlay, became\r\nequally prominent. They came to America with the Best family in 1839,\r\nfrom County Cavan, Ireland. The Rev. William B. Finlay was an ardent\r\nchurch worker, and a school teacher in Ireland. His father, before him,\r\nwas a school teacher and a member of the English church. His mother was\r\na primitive Methodist and a member of the Bell family, hence the initial\r\n“B” was retained by the brothers and sisters. He had his religious\r\ntraining under such noted ministers as Rev. G. B. Moffatt, Doctor\r\nAverill and Gideon Ousley, D. D., a converted priest, who generally\r\npreached a part of his sermons in Irish. In his twentieth year, his\r\nfather having died in 1829, the Rev. William Bell Finlay took charge of\r\nhis father’s old parish school. In 1830 he attended the Kildare College\r\nin Dublin. He afterwards served five years as a government teacher, from\r\nwhich he resigned to accept charge of a school in the Parish of\r\nTyholland, County Monaghan, where he married Charlotte Best and united\r\nwith the Methodist Church. He remained at Tyholland, teaching and as an\r\nexhortor, until he started for Quincy, where he arrived June sixth,\r\n1839, and the following Sunday united with the Methodist Church. He was\r\nlicensed to exhort in September of that year, and in 1849 was ordained\r\nby Bishop Janes when the conference met at Quincy. The year before he\r\ndied, he prepared a little sketch of his life work, which was found by\r\nhis children after his death. The last paragraph, which we quote, shows\r\nthat his was a beautiful Christian life: “So I am now in my eighty-ninth\r\nyear, and an official member of the old Illinois Conference, still in\r\nthe church of my childhood and of my youth, and of riper years. And now,\r\nold and grey-headed, I love the church of my choice; I love her\r\ndoctrines and her ways. Though feeble in body, praise God, my mind is\r\nclear and sound as a bell. I don’t know how soon I may be permitted to\r\nleave for home, but it cannot be long. But Glory, honor, power and\r\ndominion be unto God, and the lamb, forever. Amen and Amen.” He died\r\nOctober fourth, 1898, at West Point, Illinois, within a few days of his\r\nninetieth year. His four sons were all in the Union army and made\r\nexcellent soldiers; William J. B. Finlay is dead; Matthew G. Finlay is a\r\nwealthy farmer; John H. Finlay is living at Warsaw, Illinois, a\r\nprominent lawyer and wealthy; Gerald H. Finlay is a retired, wealthy\r\nfarmer and merchant in Quincy; all of fine reputations. His brother\r\nMatthew B. Finlay was a prosperous merchant and died wealthy, about ten\r\nyears ago, leaving no children. James B. Finlay was not married. He died\r\nshortly after coming to Quincy. Ann B. Finlay married George Padgett\r\nbefore leaving Ireland. Her grandson, George H. Wilson, is a prominent\r\nattorney at the Quincy bar, and now a member of the State Legislature.\r\nJane B. Finlay was married in Quincy to F. K. Carrott. Her son James\r\nFinlay Carrott, was a graduate of Harvard, and at the time of his death\r\nwas an attorney for the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad and was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Matthew Finlay Carrott, also of Harvard, who is\r\nmarried to a daughter of Judge Montgomery, president of the State\r\nSavings, Loan and Trust Company, one of the oldest banking institutions\r\nin Quincy, and lives in the handsome Matthew B. Finlay homestead. Her\r\ndaughter, Helen Carrott Walz, had two sons, one now being dead, the\r\nother an attorney in Chicago. Mrs. Walz was at one time considered\r\nQuincy’s brightest daughter. She now resides in Chicago with her son.\r\nMary B. Finlay married William Jones in Quincy. Three of her sons are\r\nnow railroad men in the West. One of them is in charge of the telegraph\r\nsystem of the Santa Fé Railroad. William Finlay Morgan, a grandson of\r\nMary B. Finlay Jones, is now located in New York City. He married the\r\ndaughter and only child of Mr. Nevins, head of the American Cordage\r\nCompany. Before his marriage, he was in the employ of the company, first\r\nat St. Louis and then in New York, and made good in every department\r\nentrusted to his care.\r\n\r\nThe Redmond family became quite prominent. Thomas Redmond was sixteen\r\nyears of age when he came from Ireland. He first located in Vermont,\r\nwhere he obtained employment at whatever offered. He came to Quincy in\r\n1837. Being young, vigorous and industrious, success attended him from\r\nthe start. He soon accumulated sufficient capital as a common laborer to\r\npurchase a few horses, carts and wagons, which enabled him to accept\r\ncontracts in constructing railroads, at which he made money rapidly and\r\ninvested every surplus dollar in Quincy real estate. In 1848 he was\r\nelected a member of the city council; in 1860, mayor; in 1864 to a seat\r\nin the State Legislature. From 1837 until his death in 1883, he was a\r\nvaluable servant of the city and state. He was one of the twenty\r\ncitizens who furnished the capital from their private funds to build and\r\nequip the Quincy, Missouri and Pacific Railroad, from Quincy toward\r\nOmaha, Nebraska. Possessed of large wealth, he employed it liberally to\r\nbeautify and advance the interests of the city in which it was\r\naccumulated. His son, Patrick H. Redmond, was educated at the Catholic\r\nCollege in Washington, D. C., and became a brilliant newspaper writer as\r\neditor of the Quincy Herald, but did not survive his father. His son,\r\nJames Redmond, continued his father’s occupation as a contractor and is\r\nstill in Quincy. Two of his daughters are living here. Margaret is the\r\nwidow of Jacob Dick of the noted Dick Brothers Brewing Company. She is\r\nvery wealthy, is a shrewd financier and is a prominent worker in the\r\nCatholic Church. She has two sons, who with their cousins manage the\r\ngreat brewing business established by their fathers. The daughter of\r\nMargaret Redmond Dick, Mrs. John B. Ellis, is a widow, who owns and\r\nmanages the Quincy Whig and is a favorite in society. A daughter of\r\nThomas Redmond, Catherine, is the wife of J. Frank Ricker, cashier of\r\nthe Ricker National Bank, one of the strongest financial institutions in\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nThe Heire or Haire Brothers—spelled both ways—came to Quincy before\r\n1840. They proved to be valuable and influential citizens as merchants\r\nand professional men. Captain Thomas J. Heire, a son of Thomas, Sr.,\r\nserved his country gallantly in the Union Army. He is a printer by trade\r\nand after the war published the Quincy Evening News. For a number of\r\nyears he held the office of city clerk. He was popular and efficient,\r\nthe soul of honor and as honest as the sun. In late years he held a\r\nposition in the Treasury Department at Washington, but is now taking\r\nlife easy among his relatives and the friends of his youth in Quincy.\r\n\r\nThe Long Brothers came in 1839 with the Best and Finlay families, to\r\nwhom they were related. They were both contractors and farmers, settling\r\nin or near the city and becoming wealthy. Their sons are still in\r\nQuincy. They are grain buyers and large capitalists. They stand well in\r\nthe community and are active members of the Methodist Church.\r\n\r\nThe McCormick Brothers came in company with the Longs and located on\r\nfarms close to Quincy. A number of their collaterals are still in the\r\ncity and county, all fairly prosperous and respected. James McCormick,\r\nJr., went to California in 1848 and became very wealthy as a merchant at\r\nRedding. He died without direct heirs, a few years ago, leaving his\r\nwealth to his nephews and nieces here and at other places in the West.\r\n\r\nThomas Rhea came in 1839. He settled on a farm near the Longs and became\r\nwealthy. He is an admirable citizen, industrious and frugal. He has\r\nlately moved into the city to take his remnant of life easy.\r\n\r\nDr. John Fitzpatrick remained unmarried. He acquired much wealth, which\r\nhe left to his nephews and nieces. It was said that he had been a\r\npriest. He was highly eccentric, but honorable.\r\n\r\nJohn W. McFadon came before 1830, after serving his adopted country in\r\nthe war of 1812. He followed merchandising and farming and became very\r\nwealthy. He left two sons and a daughter—William and Robert McFadon,\r\nboth graduates of Harvard and lawyers of a high grade. Both died in\r\nChicago, where they added to their wealth in the practice of their\r\nprofession, and by largely dealing in real estate. At the time of his\r\ndeath, William McFadon was attorney for the Lake Shore Railroad. He left\r\ntwo sons, John W. and Donald, both of Harvard and attorneys, also a\r\ndaughter Anna. His daughter Anna is the wife of Hon. William A.\r\nRichardson, son of Senator W. A. Richardson, who in the days of Douglas\r\nwas one of the best known democrats in the republic. They have no\r\nchildren. Robert McFadon left one son, Robert, lately graduated as an\r\nattorney from Harvard, and two daughters who are in Chicago.\r\n\r\nJames Arthur was born in Londonderry, Ireland, March 2, 1811, and came\r\nto America in 1833. For a number of years he owned and operated\r\nsteamboats on the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. In 1840 he located in\r\nQuincy as a pork packer and general merchant. He also operated a saw\r\nmill. He died wealthy in 1899, at the age of eighty-eight years. He was\r\nmoral, temperate and frugal. Four sons and three daughters survived him.\r\nThe only one of the family now in Quincy is a daughter Virginia M.,\r\nwidow of Col. Edward Prince. One of his sons, James A. Arthur, owns a\r\nlarge farm at La Belle, Missouri. The other sons, I. H., William N. and\r\nW. A., are successful merchants in western cities.\r\n\r\nThe Little, Carroll and Campbell families were related by marriage and\r\ncame to Quincy direct from Ireland in 1836. Edward Little had two sons,\r\nPatrick H. and Frank E., both well educated, and are now successful\r\nbusiness men in St. Louis, Missouri. James Campbell had three sons, who\r\nare now in the lime business in Quincy, as was their father and also\r\ntheir uncle Arthur Carroll.\r\n\r\nThe Benneson Brothers, Nathaniel, Thomas, Robert and William were born\r\nin Newcastle County, Delaware. Both parents came from Ireland in 1800.\r\nAll of these brothers became prosperous citizens of Quincy. In their\r\nyouth, all learned the carpenter’s trade, except William, who was the\r\nyoungest. They came to Quincy in 1837. The carpenters worked at their\r\ntrade as journeymen until they accumulated funds that enabled them to\r\nbecome contractors, in which Thomas continued until his death in 1870.\r\nNathaniel and Robert became successful lumber merchants. Robert retired\r\nfrom the lumber business in 1872 and devoted himself to buying and\r\nimproving real estate, in which he was also successful. Many of the most\r\nimposing and durable buildings in the city were erected and owned by\r\nRobert Benneson. He filled many positions of trust and honor. He served\r\nas alderman and as mayor, and for several years preceding his death was\r\npresident of the school board. He was president of the gas company,\r\nwhich he helped to organize; was a director in numerous corporations,\r\namong them the First National Bank, the Gas Company and the Quincy,\r\nAlton and St. Louis Railroad. He was a zealous and generous supporter of\r\nthe moral, social and commercial growth of the city, and none ranked\r\nhigher in public esteem. He died at the age of eighty-five years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. JOHN J. MEE,\r\n\r\n  Judge of Probate, Woonsocket, R. I.\r\n\r\n  A Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWilliam Benneson was a lawyer. His first partner was Stephen A. Douglas.\r\nTheirs was the first law office in Quincy. Mr. Benneson had served as\r\nclerk of the circuit court. After Mr. Douglas went on the bench, Mr.\r\nBenneson was identified with several of the leading lawyers of Illinois.\r\nWhen the civil war broke out he was made Colonel of the Seventy-eighth\r\nIllinois. After the war, he resumed his practice. He was made postmaster\r\nof Quincy by President Johnston. He died in 1899 at the age of\r\neighty-one years. Like his brothers, Colonel Benneson was a man of the\r\nstrictest integrity.\r\n\r\nThe Brothers, David and Dennis Higgins, came to Quincy before 1840. Both\r\nwere successful contractors in railroad building and street grading and\r\nbecame property holders. David died several years ago at a ripe age,\r\nleaving sons and daughters. Dennis died in 1904 at the age of\r\nninety-two, and although married he had no children. Both brothers were\r\ndevout Catholics. David was a staunch Democrat and Dennis equally as\r\nstaunch a Republican. They were good citizens.\r\n\r\nJames Fisher was born in 1811 near Londonderry, Ireland, and with two\r\nsisters came to Quincy in 1833. They were strict Presbyterians. Mr.\r\nFisher was a successful dry goods merchant and died wealthy while\r\nattending to his business at his store in 1898, at the age of\r\neighty-eight. He had three sons, who are now doing business at Kansas\r\nCity and other places in the West. Mr. Fisher’s sisters never married.\r\nBoth are now dead.\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Powers was born at Temple, New Hampshire, of Irish descent.\r\nHe came to Quincy in 1838; was a brickmason and followed that trade for\r\nseveral years, then entered into partnership with Matthew B. Finlay in\r\nthe clothing business, where he accumulated much wealth. After the death\r\nof Governor Wood, the beautiful Woodland Cemetery was neglected and\r\ncommenced to run down. Mr. Powers organized the Woodland Cemetery\r\nAssociation, of which he was chosen president, and soon restored that\r\nsacred garden of the dead to its former position, the most beautiful\r\ncemetery in the West. He died in 1895 at the age of eighty-four years.\r\nOnly one son, W. C. Powers, survived him, and he is now a retired\r\nmerchant.\r\n\r\nThe Shannahan Brothers, John, William and Patrick, born in Waterford\r\nCounty, Ireland, came to Quincy before 1840. They were all successful\r\nrailroad builders and constructed roads in all parts of the country. In\r\n1852 they built sections of the Iron Mountain Railroad in Missouri. They\r\nconstructed the Northern Cross Railroad between Quincy and Clayton. Had\r\ncontracts on the Hannibal and St. Joseph road, and the Quincy, Alton and\r\nSt. Louis road. John and William lived to a ripe age. Patrick survived\r\nthem. He died in 1895 at the age of eighty-four years, leaving three\r\nsons, James P., Richard and William, and four daughters, all in Quincy\r\nexcept William, who is in California. John Shannahan had two sons, but\r\nWilliam had none. A brother, Thomas, came from Ireland in 1851.\r\n\r\nJohn Burns, Sr., was born in Maine of Irish parents and came to Quincy\r\nin 1834 with a family of several sons. He was a man of strong religious\r\nconvictions and a hater of slavery. John Burns, Jr., went to California\r\nin 1849 and became a prominent man of that state. George W. Burns went\r\nwith his brother, but returned after one year and engaged in the\r\nmercantile business in the town of Payson, eighteen miles south of\r\nQuincy, where his father was then residing. In 1854 he returned to\r\nQuincy, and in company with John Wood, Jr., engaged in the flour milling\r\nbusiness. In 1862 he was appointed paymaster in the army with the rank\r\nof Major, and was captured on the Red River and held for three months.\r\nHe was elected a state senator in 1874. In 1880, he went again to\r\nCalifornia, where in a gallant effort to catch a team of runaway horses\r\nattached to a carriage containing ladies, he was killed on the streets\r\nof Sacramento. Major Burns inherited a brave and generous disposition to\r\nrisk his own life to save that of others, as shown by the brave conduct\r\nof his father in saving and protecting the noted Doctor Nelson, the most\r\nbrilliant man among the early pioneers. Dr. David Nelson was born in\r\nTennessee. He was a friend of Andrew Jackson and served under him as\r\nsurgeon during the war of 1812. He had been an infidel, but was\r\nconverted and became an ardent advocate of Christianity. He was an\r\nextensive slave holder and moved with them to Missouri, near Palmyra,\r\neighteen miles west of Quincy. He was a kind and humane master and soon\r\ncaused a bitter feeling against himself among his slave holding\r\nneighbors by persisting in teaching his negroes to read and write and\r\ngiving them religious instruction in defiance of a law then existing\r\nforbidding the teaching of negroes. He attempted to found a college at\r\nPalmyra, and had books shipped to him from the East. Upon opening one of\r\nthe boxes, it was found that not being quite full of books, it had been\r\nfilled with anti-slavery pamphlets, by some eastern man who knew his\r\ndesires to educate and uplift the blacks. The knowledge of the receipt\r\nof the pamphlets spread like wild-fire among the slave holders, who\r\ndetermined to take his life. The Doctor was spirited away by his friends\r\nand hid in a cave, where he wrote the first chapter of his great work on\r\n“Infidelity,” while his enemies were scouring the country for him, with\r\nall of the roads guarded and every supposable means of escape cut off.\r\nHis friends implored him to come to Quincy. Making his way through a\r\nheavy forest, he arrived at midnight on the west bank of the Mississippi\r\nRiver opposite Quincy, where John Burns and other friends were to meet\r\nhim and row him across. While waiting at the edge of the forest for his\r\nfriends to appear, with the wide sweeping river before him and the\r\nlights of Quincy on the opposite shore, he composed that beautiful hymn,\r\n“The Shining Shore”:\r\n\r\n                  My days are gliding swiftly by\r\n                  And I, a pilgrim stranger,\r\n                  Would not detain them as they fly,\r\n                  Those hours of toil and danger.\r\n\r\n                  Chorus.\r\n\r\n                  For Oh, we stand on Jordan’s strand,\r\n                    Our friends are passing over,\r\n                  And just before, the shining shore,\r\n                    We may almost discover.\r\n\r\nWhen Burns and his friends arrived with boats, they informed him that a\r\nnumber of infuriated slave holders were on the other side, determined to\r\nseize him and bring him back to Missouri. To avoid them, they rowed up\r\nthe river twenty miles before crossing to Illinois, then quietly brought\r\nhim down, overland, to Quincy. Several efforts were afterwards made to\r\nretake Doctor Nelson to Missouri, but John Burns and his loyal friends\r\nvigilantly guarded him until the bitter feeling subsided and died out.\r\nIn Quincy Doctor Nelson established one of his four institutes to\r\neducate young men for Christian Missionaries, in which he spent all of\r\nhis own means besides much money raised by him in the East. He died\r\npoor, at the age of fifty-one, and was buried in Woodland Cemetery,\r\nwhere friends have erected a large granite monument to his memory. He\r\nleft only a daughter, a Mrs. Rose Clapp, who, if living, is now in\r\nCalifornia. One of John Burns’ daughters is in Quincy, Mrs.\r\nSchermerhorn. Miss Julia Burns, long a school teacher here, is now\r\nemployed in the Treasury Department at Washington.\r\n\r\nSamuel Hopkins Emery, D. D., born at Andover, Massachusetts, in 1815,\r\ndied in Taunton, Massachusetts, October fifth, 1901, was a Manx and\r\nIrish Celt. His father was John Emery, who traced back to John Emery of\r\nNewbury, Massachusetts, who, with his brother Arthur, came to America\r\nfrom Ramsey, Isle of Man, England, in 1635. His mother was a daughter of\r\nColonel Welch of New Hampshire, who commanded a regiment under\r\nWashington during the war for American freedom. Doctor Emery graduated\r\nat Amherst College, a classmate of Henry Ward Beecher. He was one of the\r\nbrainy Americans, who made their age and time famous for high thought\r\nand culture. He came to Quincy as pastor of the First Congregational\r\nChurch in 1855, at the height of the formative thought that lifted the\r\nRepublic out of the black slime of human slavery and made of it in deed,\r\nas well as name, what their fathers of 1776 meant it should be, a real\r\nland of the free and home of the brave. Doctor Emery remained in Quincy\r\nfifteen years, during which time he endeared himself to all by a kind\r\nand generous nature and an untiring interest in the public welfare.\r\nDuring the war there were three military hospitals in Quincy, crowded\r\nwith sick and wounded soldiers brought up the river on boats from the\r\nfrontier. Doctor Emery was the army chaplain in charge. He comforted and\r\ncheered as few men could, the sick and wounded, especially those on\r\nwhose brows the cold hand of death was laid, because his heart was in\r\nthe cause of the country for which they were suffering and dying. Early\r\nin the war, he aided in organizing two patriotic bands of Quincy women\r\ndevoted to the relief and comfort of soldiers, not only in his own\r\nhospitals, but on the fields everywhere. They were known as the “Needle\r\nPickets” and “The Good Samaritans,” among whom were Mrs. Governor Wood,\r\nMrs. Anna McFadon, Mrs. Robert Benneson, Mrs. Anna McMahon, Miss Ella\r\nCarrott and Mrs. Finlay, the wives and daughters of Irish pioneers.\r\nThose consecrated women devoted their time and strength and means to\r\nfurnish supplies for the hospitals at home and on the fields of\r\nconflict. They commenced their work early, scraping lint and rolling\r\nbandages, and remained active until the close of the war. They organized\r\nan “Old Folks” concert company that gave entertainment in cities in\r\nIllinois, Iowa and Missouri. They sent nurses to the front. They held a\r\nfair in Quincy that continued two weeks and netted them $36,000. With\r\nthe consent of President Lincoln, they sent Doctor Emery to visit the\r\nhospitals in the South and report on their condition. The following is a\r\ncopy of his pass or authority:\r\n\r\n\r\n          “WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., April 13, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Ordered; That permission be given to the Rev. S. Hopkins Emery of\r\n  Quincy, Ill., to pass within the lines of the United States forces to\r\n  Savanna, Tennessee, and wherever the sick and wounded soldiers of the\r\n  United States may be, together with any ladies and gentlemen that may\r\n  be in his company, for the purpose of affording care and attendance to\r\n  the sick and wounded. The quartermasters and commissaries will afford\r\n  them transportation when required and all officers and persons in the\r\n  service or employment of the United States will afford them courtesy,\r\n  assistance and protection.\r\n\r\n                                     “(Signed)    EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n                                                     “Secretary of War.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Sanitary Fair, which was held in mammoth tents which\r\ncovered Washington Park at Quincy, Illinois, attracted the attention of\r\nthe nation. One of the things offered by them at auction was a book of\r\nautographs signed for the occasion by some of the most distinguished men\r\nand women of the time. The one from James Russell Lowell was accompanied\r\nby the following note and verses:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I couldn’t send a bare signature to a state which has sent 200,000\r\n  men to fight the battles of us all and whose regiments bear on their\r\n  tattered flags the names of our most glorious victories.\r\n\r\n            “Tears may be ours, but proud for those who win\r\n              Death’s royal purple in the enemy’s lines.\r\n            Peace, too, brings tears, and ‘mid the battle din,\r\n              The wiser ear some text of God divines.\r\n            For the sheathed blade may rust with darker sin.\r\n\r\n            “God give us peace, not such as lulls to sleep,\r\n              But sword on thigh and brow with purpose knit\r\n            And let our Ship of State to harbor sweep,\r\n              Her ports all up, her battle lanterns lit\r\n            And her hushed thunders gathering for their leap.\r\n\r\n                                             “(Signed)     J. R. LOWELL.\r\n\r\n  “Cambridge, Mass., October, 1864.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo grave of all the millions who maintained the Union cause on or off\r\nthe battlefield deserves to be more gratefully remembered and strewn\r\nwith flowers each recurring Memorial Day than that which in Taunton,\r\nMassachusetts, contains the remains of the patriotic Quincy Chaplain,\r\nDr. S. Hopkins Emery. At the time of Doctor Emery’s death, his two sons\r\nwere among the most prominent business men in Quincy, S. H. Emery, Jr.,\r\nwas vice-president and manager of the Straw Board Paper Company; J. W.\r\nEmery is president of one of our largest stove foundries, and father of\r\nan interesting, growing family. S. H. Emery, Jr., died shortly after his\r\nvenerable father, leaving only a daughter, Mrs. Ellis, surviving him.\r\n\r\nGeorge Brophy came from Kilkenny, Ireland. He was an assistant in the\r\ncounty clerk’s office for many years. In 1868 he was himself elected as\r\nclerk and by repeated elections held the office for twenty-four years.\r\nHe had but one son, who died at about the age of thirty years, and two\r\nyears before the death of his father. His only daughter is the wife of\r\nDuke Schroer, now one of the editors of the Quincy Journal.\r\n\r\nJohn Lawless was born in Stafford County, Virginia, June 20, 1795. His\r\nfather was John Lawless of Irish blood and a slave holder. He served all\r\nthrough the Revolutionary War and was wounded at the battle of Cowpens.\r\nHis mother was a Scotch lady. She was a devout Catholic and also a\r\ndoctor who practised a little. The subject of our sketch, while still a\r\nboy, moved to Kentucky with his mother’s parents, where he received a\r\ncommon school education. On February 24, 1820, he married Margaret\r\nSkirvin, a devout Baptist, and settled in Grant County, Kentucky, on a\r\nfarm. In 1835, with a family of seven children, they came to Adams\r\nCounty, Illinois, and settled on a farm twelve miles northeast of\r\nQuincy, where his descendants are still living. It required four weeks\r\nto come in an ox-wagon from Kentucky to Quincy. After coming to Adams\r\nCounty, three more children were born to them. John Lawless was a model\r\npioneer. He was a fine rifle shot and enjoyed the use of a gun. He was a\r\nvery successful farmer; a good business man; an excellent hand to write\r\ndeeds and legal documents for his friends and neighbors. He was a\r\nconsistent Old School Baptist. He died May 13, 1865. All of his ten\r\nchildren grew to maturity. Like their father, all may well be considered\r\nwestern pioneers. His oldest son, Henry Harrison, died at the age of\r\ntwenty-one; Mary Ann, the second child, is still living at the age of\r\neighty-six years at Columbus, Illinois. She was married in 1846 to\r\nWilliam Judy, who died a year later. A son, William H., was born to\r\nthem. Her daughter-in-law and three children are living in Pawnee,\r\nOklahoma. Elizabeth Jane Lawless, born December 8, 1824, was married to\r\nJohn P. Yeargain April 9, 1849, and died April 15, 1899. Her descendants\r\nnumber thirty-two. John Quincy Lawless, born December 1, 1826, was\r\nmarried to Elizabeth Pearce, February 26, 1863. Both are living in\r\nColumbus, Illinois. They have two sons and two daughters, all married,\r\nand five grandchildren. William Conrad Lawless was born in 1828, and was\r\nmarried February 1, 1855, to Mary Ann Pierce. He died February 15, 1898.\r\nTheir descendants, including sons and daughters, number twenty-six.\r\nSarah Margaret Lawless was married to John Lummis, February 26, 1852.\r\nShe still lives at Paloma, Illinois, a widow. She has eight children and\r\ntwenty-three grandchildren. Thomas Lawless was born March 21, 1834; died\r\nFebruary 28, 1897. He married Annie M. Ferguson, in 1874. They have\r\nthree sons, a daughter-in-law and one grandchild. Susannah Lawless, born\r\nMarch 18, 1836, died November 25, 1876. She married James R. McBroom\r\nOctober 10, 1855. Their living descendants number twenty-eight. James\r\nSanford Lawless lives on the farm where he was born seventy-one years\r\nago. He married Clara Ferguson in 1871. They have seven children; two of\r\nthem are married. Oliver Perry, the youngest, born July 20, 1841,\r\nmarried Margaret Gutherie, March 10, 1864. This branch numbers\r\ntwenty-one. They have all followed farming, taking up much of their\r\nlands in a wild state when of but little value. They broke out the\r\nprairie sod, fought their way through the hardships known only to the\r\nearly settler, and are now turning over these farms in a high state of\r\ncultivation to their children. But, better than this, they are leaving\r\nan example in their lives, which is worthy of imitation. The third\r\ngeneration numbers eighty-five. The most active of all at the present\r\ntime running in age from children to sixty years of age. They represent\r\nvarious avocations of life, but the greater part are farmers. There are\r\nseventy-nine of the fourth generation, scattered among five states, and\r\nseven of the fifth generation, a total of one hundred and eighty-four.\r\nVery few families have held together so long in residence and\r\nassociation; comparatively few are living outside of Adams County, and\r\nthose who are keep in close touch with the rest. On the twenty-first day\r\nof August, 1909, the Lawless family held a reunion at Columbus. It was\r\nthe largest gathering of this kind ever held in Adams County. The\r\nLawless family of Adams County and its branches are the only ones known\r\nin the West. It is known prominently still in Virginia.\r\n\r\nOan Piggott, father of the writer, came from near Thurles, County\r\nTipperary, Ireland, in 1844, with two sons and two daughters by a first\r\nmarriage and one son by a second marriage. He came via New Orleans to\r\nSt. Louis, Missouri. William was the oldest son. He was a steamboat mate\r\non the lower Mississippi and was killed in the Confederate service\r\nduring the civil war, as an officer in an Arkansas regiment. Michael,\r\nthe next son, learned the bricklayers’ trade in St. Louis, and at the\r\nage of twenty moved to Quincy, where he commenced business for himself\r\nas a builder. When the war commenced, he enlisted in the Union Army in\r\nCompany “F,” Birge’s sharpshooters, subsequently known as the Fourteenth\r\nMissouri Infantry, and finally as the Sixty-sixth Illinois Infantry,\r\ncommanded by Col. Patrick E. Burk of St. Louis, Mo. At Fort Donaldson,\r\nhe was promoted as Captain of his company. In February, 1864, his\r\ncompany reënlisted. On the fourteenth day of the following May, he lost\r\na leg at the battle of Resace, Georgia, where Burk was killed. The older\r\nof the two girls, Honora, entered a Catholic convent at St. Louis, and\r\ndied in 1865. The younger, Mary, died in St. Louis in 1847 from cholera.\r\nJames, the youngest son, a stove moulder by trade, died at Louisville,\r\nKentucky, since the civil war. Two children by the second marriage were\r\nborn in St. Louis, Richard and Sarah, both now living, Richard in St.\r\nLouis, and Sarah in Calaway County, Missouri, the wife of Christopher\r\nConnell, a prosperous farmer. Richard served with Price in the\r\nConfederate service, until captured at the battle of Iuka, Mississippi,\r\nin 1863. Oan Piggott died on a farm in Warren County, Missouri, in 1876.\r\n\r\nThe Flynn, Kirby and Larkin families are well represented by grandsons,\r\nnow able managers of the J. J. Flynn Company, extensive manufacturers of\r\ncarbonated waters, syrups and extracts in Quincy.\r\n\r\nTo Joseph W. Stewart, son of the pioneer William Stewart, Sr., the State\r\nof Oregon is indebted for the scientific development of its fruit\r\ninterests at Medford. It is said that every fruit tree in Oregon is a\r\nmonument to the memory of Joseph Stewart. His brother William is a\r\nscientific fruit grower near Quincy and resides in the city.\r\n\r\nThe grandsons of these early pioneers are now forging their way to the\r\nfront in the professions and in business. In the forties, a poor widow,\r\nby the name of Wall, came to Quincy, with two children, a boy and a\r\ngirl. After coming from Ireland, she and her husband located at\r\nBaltimore, Maryland, where her children were born. There with her\r\nbrother, who was a Welch, her husband commenced contracting in the\r\nbuilding of railroads, moving west with the roads. They reached\r\nDanville, Illinois, where her husband died and left her in very poor\r\ncircumstances financially. She came with her children to Quincy and\r\nraised both to respectable positions in society. The boy, who was named\r\nEdmond Wall, is now nearly seventy years of age and a bookkeeper for a\r\ntobacco manufacturing company. He is the father of four sons; the oldest\r\nis John E., a member of the law firm of Wilson & Wall. He is an eloquent\r\nadvocate and has the promise of a great political future. J. W. Wall, a\r\nbrother, is the active manager of the Gardner Governor Company, the\r\nlargest institution of its kind, perhaps, in the world, and he has two\r\nyounger brothers as assistants.\r\n\r\nA grandson of an Irishman, C. B. McCrory, is judge of our County or\r\nprobate court, while Erde Beatty, also a grandson of an Irishman, is\r\nclerk of our Circuit Court, and William Smith, another grandson, is an\r\nassistant clerk in the County Court. Major George W. Green, of Chicago,\r\nis the grandson of John McDade, a soldier of 1812. Major Green is the\r\nhead of a large lumber company in Chicago. He was major of the\r\nSeventy-eighth Illinois Infantry during the civil war and was severely\r\nwounded. He is a prominent member of the Loyal Legion. The grandsons of\r\nTimothy Castle are successful managers of the Comstock Castle Stove\r\nCompany in Quincy, Keokuk and other cities.\r\n\r\nBarney Corrigan, with his wife and ten children, came to Quincy in 1840\r\nfrom Tyrone County, Ireland. In 1843 he settled on a farm southeast of\r\nthe city, purchased from a soldier of 1812 an Irishman by the name of\r\nConstantine Clark. His children all married after coming to America, and\r\nhad large families, excepting Edward, who died a few years after his\r\narrival. The old homestead is still in the family, having passed from\r\nBarney Corrigan to his son James, who raised a family of seven sons and\r\ntwo daughters. James occupied the farm for fifty-three years, and at his\r\ndeath it passed to his son Daniel, whose brother, James B. Corrigan, has\r\nbeen Treasurer of Adams County for two terms of four years and deputy\r\ntreasurer for several terms.\r\n\r\nAmong the steamboats running from St. Louis on the upper Mississippi\r\nbetween 1827 and 1836 which were owned or commanded by Irishmen were the\r\nfollowing: The Omega, by Captain Rafferty; the Shamrock, by Captain May;\r\nthe Emerald, the Gypsy and the O’Connell, by the Reynolds Brothers, and\r\nthe Josephine, by Captain Clark.\r\n\r\nOur subject has run away with us and has taken us far beyond the limits\r\nwe designed when we commenced these notes. The field occupied by the\r\nIrish-American pioneers of the upper Mississippi Valley, in even the\r\nvicinity of Quincy, is not exhausted by these notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     REV. FRANCIS MAKEMIE—THE PAUL OF SEAGIRT ACCOMAC, THE KNOX OF\r\n    CHESAPEAKE, AND FOUNDER OF ORGANIZED PRESBYTERIANISM IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n BY REV. HAVERGAL SHEPPARD, D. D., MINISTER OF THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH\r\n                         AT SCHENECTADY, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust fifty-five years after the accession of the House of Stuart to the\r\nBritish Crown; years born of those awful times of the Reformation, when\r\nmen hated each other for their creed rather than for their conduct; in\r\nthe year in which Cromwell died, 1658, Francis Makemie was born in that\r\nlittle out of the way village of the north of Ireland, Ramelton, County\r\nDonegal.\r\n\r\nThat beautiful arm of the Atlantic, called by the natives Lough Swilly,\r\nlay hard by his home and undoubtedly many were the times as a boy he\r\nplayed on its shores or swam in its clear, cool waters.\r\n\r\nLike many of the world’s great preachers, he became hopefully pious at\r\nthe age of fifteen, according to his own testimony in his answer to\r\nKeith’s “Libel Against a Catechism,” published by Francis Makemie, in\r\nBoston, 1694, he says:\r\n\r\n“’Ere I received the imposition of hands in that Scriptural and orderly\r\nseparation with my holy and ministerial calling, that I gave requiring\r\nsatisfaction to Godly, learned and judicious, discerning men, of a work\r\nof grace and conversion, wrought in my heart at fifteen years of age, by\r\nand from the pains of a Godly schoolmaster; who used no small diligence\r\nin gaining tender souls to God’s service and fear.”\r\n\r\nAt seventeen he was enrolled in the University of Glasgow in the third\r\nclass, with the ministry in view. Next we see him, January 28th, 1860,\r\nappearing before the Presbytery of Laggan at St. Johnstown, Ireland,\r\nwith a recommendation from his Pastor, Mr. Thomas Drummond, and so began\r\nhis theological training and examination; from time to time he presents\r\nhimself before the Presbytery and is examined by a competent committee.\r\n\r\nMr. William Liston reports: “September 29th, 1680, that Mr. Francis\r\nMakemy desires some more time and that he is diligent.” Again, March\r\n9th, 1681: “Upon the good report we get of Messrs. Francis Makemy and\r\nMr. Alexander Marshall, the meeting think fit to put them upon trials in\r\norder to their being licentiates to preach and they name I. Timothy 1:5\r\nto Mr. Makemy.”\r\n\r\nAgain, April 20th, 1681, Francis Makemy delivered his homily upon I.\r\nTimothy 1:5 and was approved. Matt. 11:28 was appointed to him for the\r\nnext meeting.\r\n\r\nMay 25th, 1681, Mr. Francis Makemy delivered his private homily on Matt.\r\n11:28 and was approved.\r\n\r\nThe last entry in the minute book of the presbytery of Laggan, previous\r\nto December 30th, 1690, was on July 31st, 1681. “The meeting see fit to\r\nlay aside their ordinary business at this extraordinary meeting, only,\r\nif time will permit, we will hear the exegeses of the two young men who\r\nare upon their trials.”\r\n\r\nIt is more than likely, as Dr. Briggs says in the appendix to American\r\nPresbyterianism: “That Mr. Makemy was probably licensed in the autumn of\r\n1681 and after several appropriate trials and having preached for Mr.\r\nHempton at Burt, April 2d, 1682, he was ordained to go out to America.”\r\n\r\nTwo years previous, or 1680, Colonel William Stevens laid before the\r\nPresbytery of Laggan by letter the desire of the Presbyterian families\r\nin the lower counties of Maryland on the eastern shore, for a minister\r\nto labor in that part of the country.\r\n\r\nThe clergy of the established church in Virginia and Maryland were not\r\nthose who would appeal to earnest and pious nonconformists; Hammond in\r\n“Leah and Rachel or Two Fruitful Sisters, Virginia and Maryland”\r\n(London, 1656) used strong language in speaking of the supply of clergy\r\nfrom the old land, “Yet many came, such as wore Black coats, and could\r\nbabble in a Pulpit, roar in a Tavern, exact from their Parishioners and\r\nrather by their dissoluteness destroy, than feed their Flocks;” to this\r\nmay be added the testimony of Bishop Meade of Virginia (1829–1862)\r\n“Immense were the difficulties in getting a full supply of ministers of\r\nany character, and of those who came, how few were faithful and duly\r\nqualified for the station.”\r\n\r\nIt is a well established fact that some who were discarded from the\r\nEnglish Church obtained livings in Virginia, there was not only\r\ndefective preaching but most evil living among them. One of them was for\r\nyears president of a Jockey Club and another fought a duel in sight of\r\nthe very church in which he had performed the solemn offices of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nGovernor Berkeley’s testimony in the matter has been frequently quoted,\r\n“As to religious teaching—we have forty-eight parishes and our ministers\r\nare well paid and by my consent should be better if they would pray\r\noftener and preach less, but as of all other commodities, so of this,\r\nthe worst are sent to us, and we have few that we could boast of since\r\nthe persecution in Cromwell’s tyranny drove divers worthy men hither.”\r\n\r\nAgain, according to Meade, “It is not wonderful that disaffection should\r\ntake place and dissent begin.” It was under these conditions and after\r\nLord Howard of Effingham succeeded Culpepper in Virginia, having\r\nreceived royal instructions “to allow no person to use a printing press,\r\non any occasion whatsoever,” that there came into Virginia the man whose\r\ninfluence in the cause of religious liberty in the colonies must be\r\nreckoned as second to that of but few others—this was Francis Makemie,\r\nthe Irish founder of organized Presbyterianism in America. He came by\r\nthe way of the Barbadoes and settled at Rehoboth by the river and\r\nfounded the Presbyterian Church at Snow Hill, Maryland, 1683. He was\r\nearnest, fearless and indefatigable in his labors for the spiritual\r\nuplift of the people with whom his lot was cast, and it is worth noting\r\nthat in those days of the intolerance of the established church, that\r\nthe Presbyterian denomination began its existence in a colony founded by\r\na Roman Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore. Having raised the blue banner\r\nin Maryland, he traveled by land as far as Norfolk and proceeded to\r\nCarolina, where it seems he labored among the people until the spring of\r\nthe following year, as he was in North Carolina in May.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Increase Mather, written July 22d, 1684, from Elizabeth\r\nRiver, Virginia, he speaks of a voyage engaged to South Carolina, but he\r\nmet with contrary winds and was driven as far north as Delaware Bay and\r\neventually had to put into Virginia, where he was persuaded by Colonel\r\nAnthony Lawson and other inhabitants of the Parish of Linhaven in lower\r\nNorfolk County to stay that season. Their pastor, formerly from Ireland,\r\ndied the August before and left them without a leader.\r\n\r\nMakemie seems to have remained at Elizabeth River for a considerable\r\ntime. He writes again from there to Increase Mather, Boston, N. England,\r\nunder date of July 28, 1685, in which he acknowledges the receipt of a\r\nletter and three books and refers to a Mr. Thomas Barret, a minister\r\nliving in South Carolina and from whom he had received a letter from\r\nAshley River, stating that he was about to take shipping for New England\r\nand for whom Makemie enclosed a letter. Just how long after this he\r\nremained with this people is not known, only that in the following year\r\nhe made an extended preaching tour southward to Carolina, ministering to\r\nthe spiritual necessaries of the people in neglected communities and\r\nperforming the other duties devolving upon a true minister of the\r\nGospel. It was no easy task that confronted him, while nearly three\r\nfourths of the population were dissenters from the established church.\r\n\r\n“It is safe to say,” says Cobbs, “that no small proportion of the people\r\nwere without any definite religion.” This was especially true of North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1729 Colonel William Byrd wrote of Edenton, then capital of\r\nNorth Carolina: “I believe this is the only metropolis in the Christian\r\nor Mohammedan world where there is neither church, chapel, mosque,\r\nsynagogue, or any other place of worship of any sect or religion\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n“They pay no tribute either to God or to Cæsar.”\r\n\r\nWith a knowledge of such conditions before him he put himself forward in\r\n1686, with that fearlessness characteristic of his race, to preach the\r\nGospel to the regions beyond.\r\n\r\nHow long he labored here is impossible to tell, but he returned and took\r\nup his residence on the eastern shore at Matchatauk, Virginia. His name\r\nappeared for the first time on the court records of Accomac County,\r\nVirginia, in 1690, and John Galbraith’s will, made August 12th, 1691,\r\nrefers to Makemie as Minister of the Gospel at Rehoboth town. In that\r\nyear he made a visit to England and returned either that autumn or the\r\nfollowing spring, after an earnest endeavor to inspire interest in the\r\nreligious life of the new colony. It was during the year 1692 that\r\nMakemie visited Philadelphia and planted the seed of Presbyterianism by\r\npreaching the first sermon in the Barbadoes store, northwest corner of\r\nSecond and Chestnut streets, after which, in the autumn of this year, he\r\nsailed for the Barbadoes, where he remained several years, combining the\r\nlife of a minister and a merchant, as shown by letters dated December\r\n28th, 1696; January 17th, 1697, and, February 12th, 1697, which are\r\nstill preserved.\r\n\r\nIt was either during the year 1697 or the early part of the succeeding,\r\n1698, that he returned to his old home on the eastern shore and married\r\nNaomi Anderson, according to Dr. Hill’s “Rise of American\r\nPresbyterianism.”\r\n\r\nIn a will signed by William Anderson, July 23d, 1698, and recorded\r\nOctober 10th, he refers to Mr. Francis Makemie and Naomi, his wife, my\r\neldest daughter. Again, the will says, “If my daughter Naomi have no\r\nissue,” showing that no children were born at that time.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia he suffered much annoyance from the authorities, but was the\r\nfirst dissenting minister to obtain a certificate under the toleration\r\nact, 1689, of William and Mary, having previously a certificate of his\r\nqualifications at Barbadoes, yet it was not until ten years later, 1699,\r\nthat the Virginia legislature grudgingly granted this with licenses for\r\ntwo houses in Accomac, as places of dissenting worship, to which another\r\nwas added in 1704.\r\n\r\nHow much he did for the cause he espoused through the years following\r\ncannot be computed, as he went in and out among the people, many of them\r\nPresbyterians from Scotland and Ireland, bringing the faith of their\r\nfathers with them, but in this new colony, in an environment opposed to\r\nreligious feeling, they drifted into many sins and habits that fared\r\nwell to spoil their early impressions of piety.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that all this time he supported himself by business\r\npursuits; realizing the responsibility of the growing work, he executed\r\na power of attorney to his wife May 30th, 1704, reciting that he was\r\nabout to depart for Europe, which he did, arriving in London that\r\nsummer, he then appealed to the nonconformists ministers for men and\r\nfunds to sustain them. The London ministers responded by agreeing to\r\nfurnish support for two missionaries, for two years, and Makemie at once\r\nsecured two young men, John Hampton, a fellow countryman, and George\r\nMcNish, a Scotchman (?).\r\n\r\nIt was while he sojourned in London that he published his “Plain and\r\nFriendly Persuasive to the Inhabitants of Virginia and Maryland for\r\npromoting Towns and Cohabitations, by a well wisher to both\r\nGovernments,” returning in 1705 with the foregoing young men. We find\r\nthat there were five church edifices and as many organized Presbyterian\r\ncongregations in Somerset County as a result of his previous labor.\r\n\r\nIn 1706 he had the new church building at Rehoboth erected on his own\r\nland. Indeed this was an eventful year for the Presbyterian Church, as\r\non March 22d the first Classical Assembly organized under the name\r\n“Presbytery,” presumably in the building of the First Presbyterian\r\nChurch erected 1705 at Market and Banks Streets, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMakemie seems to have been elected the first Moderator, as his name is\r\nthe first to appear on the oldest records extant. This body was composed\r\nof three pastors and four missionaries, and was a happy union of men\r\nfrom different parts of the British possessions—Makemie and Hampton from\r\nIreland, McNish from Scotland (?), Andrews, Wilson, Taylor and Davis\r\nfrom New England. A marked absentee was Josias Makie, the Irish pastor\r\nat Elizabeth River.\r\n\r\nIt claimed no authority, but it was a broad, generous, tolerant spirit\r\nwhich effected this union, and it seems to have taken the Presbytery of\r\nDublin as a model. The record of this first meeting is lost, but,\r\naccording to Briggs, “American Presbyterianism,” after the adjournment\r\nof the Presbytery in October, Francis Makemie took John Hampton with him\r\nand set out on a journey to Boston, on arrival in New York he was\r\ninvited by the Dutch minister, Rev. Gualtherus du Bois to preach in the\r\nReformed Church, but Lord Cornbury forbade the service. The preacher,\r\nnot insisting on the use of the church, held service and preached in the\r\nhouse of William Jackson “with open doors.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HONORABLE EDWARD E. McCALL.\r\n\r\n  Justice of the Supreme Court of New York.\r\n\r\n  A Life Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHampton preaching also on the same Sunday, January 20th, 1707, at\r\nNewtown, L. I. So bold a defiance aroused the wrath of the Governor,\r\nwho, on the 24th of the month issued a warrant for the arrest of both\r\nmen, “who have taken upon them to preach in a private house without\r\nhaving obtained any license for so doing, as they have gone into Long\r\nIsland with intent there to spread their pernicious doctrines and\r\nprinciples to the disturbance of the church by law, established and of\r\nthe government of this province.” The warrant was executed and the\r\nculprits were brought for examination before the Governor when Makemie\r\ndefended his liberty on the toleration act of England—this act Cornbury\r\ndeclared to be without any force in his government, and required the\r\nprisoners to give bonds for good behaviour and to promise not to preach\r\nin New York or New Jersey. Makemie was willing to give bonds, but\r\nrefused the promise, and both men were put in jail, where they remained\r\nsix weeks and four days, during the absence of Chief Justice Momperson.\r\nOn the return of the Judge they were brought before him on a writ of\r\n“habeas corpus.” Hampton was discharged without trial as a “man of less\r\ninterest,” while Makemie was liberated under bonds to appear for trial\r\nat the next session of the court, the Grand Jury having found a true\r\nbill against him, “that he did take upon himself to preach in a\r\nconventicle and meeting not permitted or allowed by law, under color or\r\nexcuse of religion in other manner than according to our Liturgy and\r\npractice of the Church of England.”\r\n\r\nOn his release he immediately returned to Philadelphia with Hampton for\r\nthe meeting of Presbytery March 22d, 1707. From thence he writes to\r\nBenjamin Colman of Boston: “Since our imprisonment we have commenced a\r\ncorrespondence with our Reverend Breth of the ministry at Boston, which\r\nwe hope according to our intention has been communicated to you all,\r\nwhose sympathizing concurrence I cannot doubt of, in an expensive\r\nstruggle for asserting our liberty against the powerful invasion of Lord\r\nCornbury, which is not yet over.\r\n\r\n“I need not tell you of a picked jury and the penal laws are invading\r\nour American sanctuary without the least regard to the toleration, which\r\nshould justly alarm us all.”\r\n\r\nAt the trial, in the following June, the prosecution relied on the royal\r\ninstruction to Cornbury, rather than on the ministry act, as though\r\nconscious that said act, while establishing a church, yet inflicted no\r\npenalties for non-conformity.\r\n\r\nMakemie defended himself, producing licenses from the Governors of\r\nVirginia and Maryland, contending that there was nothing in the English\r\ncommon or statute law to hold him, and nothing in the laws of New York\r\nagainst the liberty he had exercised.\r\n\r\nAs to the Governor’s ecclesiastical authority, he argued that it could\r\nnot exist without the due promulgation of law.\r\n\r\nThe plea of Makemie was so forceful that a jury “Packed to convict” was\r\nwon over to his cause and unanimously acquitted him. The court, however,\r\nwould not release him until he had paid all the costs, which, together\r\nwith his expenses, amounted to £83, as sufficiently heavy burden, for\r\nwhich he must yet have had great compensation in the consciousness that\r\nhe had fought a great fight and won a great victory in the cause of\r\nhuman liberty. Never again did a New York Governor attempt to silence\r\nany orderly preaching of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nTo Cornbury the issue of the case brought a bitter mortification, and he\r\nseems to have been seriously alarmed for the consequence to himself from\r\nthe reports of the trial made by Mr. Makemie and his friends in England\r\nand the Colonies.\r\n\r\nWriting to the lords of trade in October, 1707, he denied that Makemie\r\nhad applied to him for a license, and said: “I entreat your Lordship’s\r\nprotection against that malicious man, who is well known in Virginia and\r\nMaryland to be a disturber of the peace and quiet of all places he comes\r\ninto; he is a Doctor of Physic, a Merchant, and attorney or counsellor\r\nat law, and, which is worse of all, a disturber of governments.”\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Makemie ever took any action against Cornbury,\r\nnor was it needed to the damage of his Lordship’s reputation, which his\r\ncourse had so deeply stained.\r\n\r\nThe trial being over, Makemie seems to have continued on his journey to\r\nNew England, as he addressed a letter to Lord Cornbury from Boston in\r\nJuly, 1707, and, according to a bequest in his will made soon after,\r\n“Mr. Jedediah Andrews, Minister at Philadelphia, is given my new cane,\r\nbought and fixed in Boston.” This will was signed April 27th, 1708, in\r\nwhich he refers to his wife and two daughters, Elizabeth and Anne\r\nMakemie.\r\n\r\nSome time between this and August 4th, when the will was ordered to be\r\nrecorded, Makemie died, with a solemn declaration of attachment to his\r\nmother church and so ended the career, at the age of fifty, of one of\r\nthe greatest men who ever came to our shores in the interest of the\r\nprotestant religion and it is safe to say had he lived in the times of\r\nthe Revolution, he would have been one of the many of his fellow\r\ncountrymen who went forth to fight for the flag of this new nation and\r\nraised their voices in behalf of human liberty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES L.

O’NEILL, ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE\r\n                                COUNCIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam and Adam Holliday, cousins, emigrated from the north of Ireland\r\nabout 1750, and settled in the neighborhood of the Manor, in Lancaster\r\nCounty, Penn. The feuds which existed between the Irish and German\r\nemigrants, as well as the unceasing efforts of the proprietary agents to\r\nkeep emigrants from settling upon their lands, induced the Hollidays to\r\nseek a location farther west. Conococheague suggested itself to them as\r\na suitable place, because it was so far removed from Philadelphia that\r\nthe proprietors could not well dispossess them; and, the line never\r\nhaving been established, it was altogether uncertain whether the\r\nsettlement was in Pennsylvania or Maryland. Besides, it possessed the\r\nadvantage of being tolerably well populated. Accordingly, they settled\r\non the banks of the Conococheague and cleared land, which they purchased\r\nand paid for soon after the survey.\r\n\r\nDuring both the French and Indian wars of 1755–56 and the war of 1762–63\r\nthe Hollidays were in active service. At the destruction of Kittaning,\r\nWilliam Holliday was a lieutenant in Colonel Armstrong’s company, and\r\nfought with great bravery in that conflict with the savages. The\r\nHollidays were emphatically frontiermen; and on the restoration of peace\r\nin 1768, probably under the impression that the Conococheague Valley was\r\nbecoming too thickly populated, they disposed of their land, placed\r\ntheir families and effects upon pack-horses, and again turned their\r\nfaces toward the west. They passed through Aughwick, but found no\r\nunappropriated lands there worthy of their attention. Thence they\r\nproceeded to the Standing Stone, but nothing offered there; nor even at\r\nFrankstown could they find any inducement to stop; so they concluded to\r\ncross the mountain by the Kittaning Path and settle on the Alleghany at\r\nor near Kittaning.\r\n\r\nWilliam knew the road, and had noticed fine lands in that direction.\r\nHowever, when they reached the place where Hollidaysburg now stands, and\r\nwere just on the point of descending the hill toward the river, Adam\r\nhalted, and declared his intention to pitch his tent and travel no\r\nfarther. He argued with his cousin that the Indian titles west of the\r\nmountains were not extinguished; and if they bought from the Indians\r\nthey would be forced, on the extinguishment of their titles, to purchase\r\na second time, or lose their lands and live in constant dread of the\r\nsavages. Although William had a covetous eye on the fine lands of the\r\nAlleghany, the wise counsel of Adam prevailed, and they dismounted and\r\nprepared to build a temporary shelter. When Adam drove the first stake\r\ninto the ground he casually remarked to William, “Whoever is alive a\r\nhundred years after this will see a tolerable-sized town here, and this\r\nwill be near about the middle of it.” This prediction had been verified\r\nto the letter long before the expiration of the allotted time.\r\n\r\nIn a day or two after a shelter had been erected for the families,\r\nWilliam crossed the river to where Gaysport now stands, for the purpose\r\nof locating. The land, however, was too swampy, and he returned. Next\r\nday he crossed again, and found a ravine, south of where he had been\r\nprospecting, which appeared to possess the desired qualifications; and\r\nthere he staked out a farm—the one now owned by Mr. J. R. Crawford.\r\nThrough this farm the old Frankstown and Johnstown Road ran for many\r\nyears—the third road constructed in Pennsylvania crossing the Alleghany\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nThese lands belonged to the new purchase, and were in the market at a\r\nvery low price, in order to encourage settlers on the frontier.\r\nAccordingly, Adam Holliday took out a warrant for 1,000 acres,\r\ncomprising all the land upon which Hollidaysburg now stands.\r\n(Hollidaysburg, named after Adam and William Hollidays, is now the\r\ncounty seat of Blair County.) The lower or southern part was too marshy\r\nto work; so Mr. Holliday erected his cabin near where the American House\r\nnow stands, and made a clearing on the high ground stretching toward the\r\neast. In the meantime, William Holliday purchased of Mr. Peters 1,000\r\nacres of land, which embraced the present Crawford and Jackson farms and\r\na greater part of Gaysport. Some years after, finding that he had more\r\nland than he could conveniently cultivate, he disposed of nearly one\r\nhalf of his original purchase to his son-in-law, James Somerville. Adam\r\nHolliday, too, having a large lot of land, disposed of a portion of it\r\nto Lazarus Lowry. Thus matters progressed smoothly for a time, until,\r\nunfortunately, a Scotchman, named Henry Gordon, in search of lands,\r\nhappened to see and admire his farm. Gordon was a keen, shrewd fellow,\r\nand, in overlooking the records of the land office, discovered a flaw or\r\ninformality in Adam’s grant. He immediately took advantage of his\r\ndiscovery, and took out a patent for the land. Litigation followed as a\r\nmatter of course. Gordon possessed considerable legal acumen, and had\r\nwithal money and a determined spirit. The case was tried in the courts\r\nbelow and the courts above—decided sometimes in favor of one party and\r\nsometimes in favor of the other, but eventually resulted in Gordon\r\nwresting from Adam Holliday and Lazarus Lowry all their land. This\r\nunfortunate circumstance deeply affected Mr. Holliday, for he had been\r\ngrossly wronged by the adroitness and cunning of Gordon; but relief came\r\nto him when he least expected it. When the war broke out, Gordon was\r\namong the very first to sail for Europe; and soon after the Council\r\nproclaimed him an attainted traitor, and his property was confiscated\r\nand brought under the hammer. The circumstances under which he had\r\nwrested the property from Holliday were known, so that no person would\r\nbid, which enabled him to regain his land at a mere nominal price. He\r\nthen went on and improved, and built a house on the bank of the river,\r\nnear where the bridge connects the boroughs of Hollidaysburg and\r\nGaysport.\r\n\r\nDuring the alarms and troubles which followed in the course of the war\r\nAdam Holliday took a conspicuous part in defending the frontier. He\r\naided, first, in erecting Fetter’s Fort, and afterwards expended his\r\nmeans in turning Titus’s stable into a fort. This fort was located on a\r\nflat, nearly opposite the second lock below Hollidaysburg, and the two\r\nserved as a place of refuge for all the settlers of what was then merely\r\ncalled the Upper End of Frankstown District. He, also, with his own\r\nmoney purchased provisions, and through his exertions arms and\r\nammunition were brought from the eastern counties. His courage and\r\nenergy inspired the settlers to make a stand at a time when they were on\r\nthe very point of flying to Cumberland County. In December, 1777, Mr.\r\nHolliday visited Philadelphia for the purpose of securing a part of the\r\nfunds appropriated to the defence of the frontier. The following letter\r\nto President Wharton was given to him by Colonel John Piper, of Bedford\r\nCounty:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     “Bedford County, December 19, 1777.\r\n\r\n  “Sir: Permit me, sir, to recommend to you, for counsel and direction,\r\n  the bearer, Mr. Holliday, an inhabitant of Frankstown, one of the\r\n  frontier settlements of our county, who has, at his own risk, been\r\n  extremely active in assembling the people of that settlement together\r\n  and in purchasing provisions to serve the militia who came to their\r\n  assistance. As there was no person appointed either to purchase\r\n  provisions or to serve them out, necessity obliged the bearer, with\r\n  the assistance of some neighbors, to purchase a considerable quantity\r\n  of provisions for that purpose, by which the inhabitants have been\r\n  enabled to make a stand. His request is that he may be supplied with\r\n  cash not only to discharge the debts already contracted, but likewise\r\n  to enable him to lay up a store for future demand. I beg leave, sir,\r\n  to refer to the bearer for further information, in hopes you will\r\n  provide for their further support. Their situation requires immediate\r\n  assistance.\r\n\r\n  “I am, sir, with all due respect, your Excellency’s most obedient\r\n  humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                           “JOHN PIPER.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Holliday’s mission was successful; and he returned with means to\r\nrecruit the fort with provisions and ammunition, and continued to be an\r\nactive and energetic frontier-man during all the Indian troubles which\r\nfollowed. Notwithstanding the distracted state of society during the\r\nRevolution, William Holliday devoted much time and attention to his\r\nfarm. His family, consisting of his wife, his sons, John, William,\r\nPatrick, Adam, and his daughter Janet, were quartered at Holliday’s\r\nFort; and it was only when absolute necessity demanded it that they\r\nventured to the farm to attend to the crops, after the savage marauders\r\nso boldly entered the settlements.\r\n\r\nJames, who we believe was next to the eldest of William Holliday’s\r\nchildren, joined the Continental army soon after the war broke out. He\r\nis represented as having been a noble-looking fellow, filled with\r\nenthusiasm, who sought for, and obtained without much difficulty, a\r\nlieutenant’s commission. He was engaged in several battles, and\r\nconducted himself in such a manner as to merit the approbation of his\r\nsenior officers; but he fell gloriously at Brandywine, while the battle\r\nwas waging, pierced through the heart by a musket ball. He was shot by a\r\nHessian, who was under cover, and who had, from the same place, already\r\ndispatched a number of persons. But this was his last shot, for a young\r\nVirginian, who stood by the side of Holliday when he fell, rushed upon\r\nthe Hessian, braving all danger, and hewed him to pieces with his sword\r\nbefore any defence could be made. The death of young Holliday was deeply\r\nlamented by his companions-in-arms, for he was brave and generous, and\r\nhad not a single enemy in the line. His friends, after the battle,\r\nburied him near the spot where he fell; and it is doubtful whether even\r\nnow a hillock of greensward remains to his memory.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the year 1779, the Indians along the frontier,\r\nemboldened by numerous successful depredations, came into Bedford\r\nCounty—within the boundaries of which Holliday’s Fort then was—in such\r\nformidable bands that many of the inhabitants fled to the eastern\r\ncounties. The Hollidays, however, and some few others, tarried, in the\r\nhope that the Executive Council would render them aid. The following\r\npetition, drawn up on the 29th of May, 1779, and signed by William\r\nHolliday and others, will give the reader some idea of the distress\r\nsuffered by the pioneers:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “To the Honorable President and Council:\r\n\r\n  “The Indians being now in the county, the frontier inhabitants being\r\n  generally fled, leaves the few that remains in such a distressed\r\n  condition that pen can hardily describe, nor your honors can only have\r\n  a faint idea of; nor can it be conceived properly by any such as are\r\n  the subjects thereof; but while we suffer in the part of the county\r\n  that is most frontier, the inhabitants of the interior part of this\r\n  county live at ease and safety.\r\n\r\n  “And we humbly conceive that by some immediate instruction from\r\n  Council, to call them that are less exposed to our relief, we shall be\r\n  able, under God, to repulse our enemies, and put it in the power of\r\n  the distressed inhabitants to reap the fruits of their industry.\r\n  Therefore, we humbly pray you would grant us such relief in the\r\n  premises as you in your wisdom see meet. And your petitioners shall\r\n  pray, etc.\r\n\r\n  “N. B.—There is a quantity of lead at the mines (Sinking Valley) in\r\n  this county Council may procure for the use of said county, which save\r\n  carriage, and supply our wants with article, which we cannot exist\r\n  without at this place; and our flints are altogether expended.\r\n  Therefore, we beg Council would furnish us with those necessaries as\r\n  they in their wisdom see cause.\r\n\r\n  “P. S.—Please to supply us with powder to answer lead.\r\n\r\n                                 (Signed) “WILLIAM HOLLIDAY, _P. M._\r\n                                           THOMAS COULTER, _Sheriff_.\r\n                                           RICHARD J. DELAPT, _Captain_.\r\n                                           SAM. DAVIDSON.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prayer of these petitioners was not speedily answered, and\r\nHolliday’s Fort was evacuated soon after. The Council undoubtedly did\r\nall in its power to give the frontiers support; but the tardy movements\r\nof the militia gave the savages confidence, and drove the few settlers\r\nthat remained almost to despair. Eventually relief came, but not\r\nsufficient to prevent Indian depredations. At length, when these\r\ndepredations and the delays of the Council in furnishing sufficient\r\nforce to repel these savage invasions had brought matters to such a\r\ncrisis that forbearance ceased to be a virtue, the people of the\r\nneighborhood moved their families to Fort Roberdeau, in Sinking Valley,\r\nand Fetter’s Fort, and formed themselves into scouting parties, and by\r\nthese means protected the frontier and enabled the settlers to gather in\r\ntheir crops in 1780; still, notwithstanding their vigilance, small bands\r\nof scalp-hunters occasionally invaded the county, and, when no scalps\r\nwere to be found, compromised by stealing horses, or by laying waste\r\nwhatever fell in their way.\r\n\r\nIn 1781, when Continental money was so terribly depreciated that it\r\ntook, in the language of one of the old settlers, “seventeen dollars of\r\nit to buy a quart of whiskey,” the government was in too straitened a\r\ncondition to furnish this frontier guard with ammunition and provisions,\r\nso that the force was considerably reduced. Small scouting parties were\r\nstill kept up, however, to watch the savages, who again made their\r\nappearance in the neighborhood in the summer, retarding the harvest\r\noperations. About the middle of July, the scouts reported everything\r\nquiet and no traces of Indians in the county. Accordingly, Mr. Holliday\r\nproceeded to his farm, and, with the aid of his sons, succeeded in\r\ngetting off and housing his grain. Early in August, Mr. Holliday,\r\naccompanied by his sons Patrick and Adam and his daughter Janet, then\r\nabout fourteen years of age, left Fort Roberdeau for the purpose of\r\ntaking off a second crop of hay. On their arrival at the farm they went\r\nleisurely to work, and mowed the grass. The weather being extremely\r\nfine, in a few days they began to haul it in on a rudely constructed\r\nsled, for in those days few wagons were in use along the frontiers. They\r\nhad taken in one load, returned, and filled the sled again, when an\r\nacquaintance named McDonald, a Scotchman, came along on horseback. He\r\nstopped, and they commenced a conversation on the war. William Holliday\r\nwas seated upon one of the horses that were hitched to the sled, his two\r\nsons were on one side of him, and his daughter on the opposite side. All\r\nof the men, as was customary then, were armed with rifles.\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was going on, and without the slightest previous\r\nintimation, a volley was suddenly fired from a thicket some sixty or\r\nseventy yards off, by which Patrick and Adam were instantly killed and\r\nthe horse shot from under Mr. Holliday. The attack was so sudden and\r\nunexpected that a flash of lightning and peal of thunder from a\r\ncloudless sky could not have astonished him more. The echoes of the\r\nIndian rifles had scarcely died away before the Indians themselves, to\r\nthe number of eight or ten, with a loud “whoop!” jumped from their place\r\nof concealment, some brandishing their knives and hatchets and others\r\nreloading their rifles. Appalled at the shocking tragedy, and undecided\r\nfor a moment what course to pursue, Holliday was surprised to see\r\nMcDonald leap from his horse, throw away his rifle, run toward the\r\nIndians, and, with outstretched arms, cry “Brother! Brother!” which it\r\nappears was a cry for quarter which the savages respected. Holliday,\r\nhowever, knew too much of the savage character to trust to their\r\nmercy—more especially as rebel scalps commanded nearly as good a price\r\nin British gold in Canada as prisoners; so on the impulse of the moment\r\nhe sprang upon McDonald’s horse and made an effort to get his daughter\r\nup behind him. But he was too late. The Indians were upon him, and he\r\nturned into the path which led down the ravine. The yells of the savages\r\nfrightened the horse, and he galloped down the path; but even the\r\nclattering of his hoofs did not drown the dying shrieks of his daughter,\r\nwho was most barbarously butchered with a hatchet.\r\n\r\nIn a state of mind bordering on distraction, Holliday wandered about\r\nuntil nearly dark, when he got upon the Brush Mountain trail, on his way\r\nto Sinking Valley. His mind, however, was so deeply affected that he\r\nseemed to care little whither he went; and, the night being exceedingly\r\ndark, the horse lost the trail and wandered about the mountain for\r\nhours. Just at daybreak Mr. Holliday reached the fort, haggard and\r\ncareworn, without hat or shoes, his clothes in tatters and his body\r\nlacerated and bleeding. He did not recognize either the fort or the\r\nsentinel on duty. He was taken in, and the fort alarmed, but it was some\r\ntime before he could make anything like an intelligible statement of\r\nwhat had occurred the day previous. Without waiting for the particulars\r\nin detail, a command of fifteen men were despatched to Holliday’s farm.\r\nThey found the bodies of Patrick and Adam precisely where they fell, and\r\nthat of Janet but a short distance from the shed, and all scalped. As\r\nsoon as the necessary arrangements could be made, the bodies of the\r\nslain were interred on the farm; and a rude tombstone still marks the\r\nspot where the victims of savage cruelty repose.\r\n\r\nThis was a sad blow to Mr. Holliday; and it was long before he recovered\r\nfrom it effectually. But the times steeled men to bear misfortunes that\r\nwould now crush and annihilate the bravest.\r\n\r\nAfter the declaration of peace, or, rather, after the ratification of\r\nthe treaty, Gordon came back to Pennsylvania and claimed his land under\r\nits stipulation. He had no difficulty in proving that he had never taken\r\nup arms against the colonies, and Congress agreed to purchase back his\r\nlands. The Commissioners to adjust claims, after examining the lands,\r\nreported them worth sixteen dollars an acre; and this amount was paid to\r\nAdam Holliday, who suddenly found himself the greatest monied man in\r\nthis county—having in his possession sixteen or seventeen thousand\r\ndollars. Adam Holliday lived to a good old age, and died at his\r\nresidence on the bank of the river, in 1801. He left two heirs—his son\r\nJohn, and a daughter married to William Reynolds.\r\n\r\nAfter the estate was settled up, it was found that John Holliday was the\r\nrichest man in this county. He married the daughter of Lazarus Lowry, of\r\nFrankstown, in 1803, and in 1807 he left for Johnstown, where he\r\npurchased the farm, and all the land upon which Johnstown now stands,\r\nfrom a Doctor Anderson, of Bedford. Fearing the place would never be one\r\nof any importance, John Holliday, in a few years, sold out to Peter\r\nLivergood for eight dollars an acre, returned to Hollidaysburg, and\r\nentered into mercantile pursuits.\r\n\r\nWilliam Holliday, too, died at a good old age, and lies buried on his\r\nfarm by the side of his children, who were massacred by the Indians. In\r\nthe ordinary transmutation of worldly affairs, the lands of both the old\r\npioneers passed out of the hands of their descendants; yet a beautiful\r\ntown stands as a lasting monument to the name, and the descendants have\r\nmultiplied until the name of Holliday is known, not only in\r\nPennsylvania, but over the whole Union.\r\n\r\n[Note.—There are several contradictory accounts in existence touching\r\nthe massacre of the Holliday children. Our account of it is evidently\r\nthe true version, for it was given to us by Mr. Maguire, who received it\r\nfrom Mr. Holliday shortly after the occurrence of the tragedy. It may be\r\nas well here to state that the original Hollidays were Irishmen and\r\nPresbyterians. It is necessary to state this, because we have heard\r\narguments about their religious faith. Some avow that they were\r\nCatholics, and as an evidence refer to the fact that William called one\r\nof his offspring “Patrick.” Without being able to account for the name\r\nof a saint so prominent in the calendar as Patrick being found in a\r\nPresbyterian family, we can only give the words of Mr. Maguire, who\r\nsaid: “I was a Catholic, and old Billy and Adam Holliday were\r\nPresbyterians; but in those days we found matters of more importance to\r\nattend to than quarrelling about religion. We all worshipped the same\r\nGod, and some of the forms and ceremonies attending church were very\r\nmuch alike, especially in 1778, when the men of all denominations, in\r\nplace of hymn-books, prayer-books, and Bibles, carried to church with\r\nthem loaded rifles!”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      GEORGE CROGAN AND AUGHWICK, HUNTINGDON COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n                 BY JAMES S. O’NEILL, ELIZABETH, N. J.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Crogan was born in Dublin, Ireland. He came to Aughwick\r\nHuntingdon County, Pennsylvania, about the year 1742 and soon after took\r\nup the business of an Indian trader. At first he located at Harris’\r\ntrading house, now Harrisburg, on the Susquehanna, and from there moved\r\nover the river into Cumberland, some eight miles from his first place.\r\nFrom there he made excursions to Path Valley, Aughwick and finally to\r\nthe Ohio river by way of the old Bedford trail. His long residence among\r\nthe Indians not only enabled him to study Indian character thoroughly,\r\nbut he acquired the language of both the Delaware and Shawnee tribes.\r\n\r\nThe history of Aughwick and of Crogan are identical during the years\r\n1754–55–56. Aughwick was not originally an Indian town, as is generally\r\nsupposed, but was a settlement of whites to which the Indians came after\r\nCrogan had made it his residence, the time of their coming being clearly\r\nshown by official records. It is therefore difficult, if not impossible,\r\nto give any reliable information concerning the origin of the name.\r\nThere is no certainty that it belongs to any of the Indian languages;\r\nthe probability is that it is derived from one of the European tongues.\r\nThe first settlers there, as in nearly all parts of Huntingdon County,\r\nwere Irish. They could furnish a name, or the town which they may have\r\nproposed founding, without resort to any other vocabulary than their\r\nown. Aughwick is said to resemble in sound two Irish words which mean\r\nliterally “Swift running steed.” In early times the orthography of the\r\nname was almost as various as were the hands by which it was first\r\nwritten. Crogan at first wrote it “Aughick,” afterwards “Aughick Old\r\nTown” and finally “Aughwik Old Town.” Crogan—first letter—published in\r\nthe Colonial Records, is dated “May 26, 1747,” and is directed to\r\nRichard Peters. It was accompanied by a letter from the Six Nations,\r\nsome wampum and a French scalp, taken somewhere on Lake Erie. In a\r\nletter from Governor Hamilton to Governor Hardy, dated July 5, 1756, in\r\nspeaking of Crogan, who was at one time suspected of being a spy in the\r\npay of the French, Hamilton says: “There were many Indian traders with\r\nBraddock—Crogan among others, who acted as a captain of the Indians\r\nunder a warrant from General Braddock, and I never heard of any\r\nobjections to his conduct in that capacity. For many years he had been\r\nvery largely concerned in the Ohio trade, was upon that river\r\nfrequently, and had a considerable influence among the Indians, speaking\r\nthe language of several nations, and being very liberal in his gifts to\r\nthem, which, with the losses he sustained by the French, who seized\r\ngreat quantities of his goods, and by not getting the debts due to him\r\nfrom the Indians, he became bankrupt, and since has lived at a place\r\ncalled Aughwick, in the back parts of this province, where he generally\r\nhad a number of Indians with him, for the maintenance of whom the\r\nprovince allowed him sums of money from time to time, but not to his\r\nsatisfaction. After this he went by my order with these Indians, and\r\njoined General Braddock, who gave the warrant I have mentioned. Since\r\nBraddock’s defeat, he returned to Aughwick, where he remained till an\r\nact of assembly was passed here granting him a freedom from arrest for\r\nten years. This was done that the province might have the benefit of his\r\nknowledge among the Indians; and immediately thereupon, while I was last\r\nat York, a captain’s commission was given to him, and he was ordered to\r\nraise men for the defence of the western frontier, which he did in a\r\nvery expeditious manner, but not so frugally as the commissioners for\r\ndisposing the public money thought he might have done. He continued in\r\nthe command of the companies he had raised, and of Fort Shirley, on the\r\nwestern frontier, about three months; having a dispute with the\r\ncommissioners about some accounts between them, in which he thought\r\nhimself ill-used, he resigned his commission, and about a month ago\r\ninformed me that he had not received pay upon General Braddock’s\r\nwarrant, and desired my recommendation to General Shirley; which I gave\r\nhim, and he set off directly for Albany, New York.”\r\n\r\nCrogan settled permanently in Augwick in 1754, and built a stockade\r\nfort, and must have been some kind of an agent among the Indians,\r\ndisbursing presents to them for the government. In December of that year\r\nhe wrote to Secretary Peters, stating the wants of his Indians, and at\r\nthe same time wrote to Governor Morris as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I am Oblige to advertize the Inhabitance of Cumberland county in ye\r\n  honours Name nott to barter or sell Spirituous Liquors to the Indians\r\n  or any other person to bring amongst them, to prevent ye Indians from\r\n  Spending there Cloase, tho I am obliged to give them a bag Now and\r\n  then my self for a frolick, but that is Attended with no Expense to ye\r\n  Government nor bad consequences to ye Indians as I do it Butt onst a\r\n  Month. I hope your honour will approve of this Proceeding, as I have\r\n  Don itt to Prevent Ill consequences attending ye Indians if they\r\n  should be always be kept Inflamed with Liquors.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Crogan and his Indians were of some service would appear from the\r\nfact that the assembly passed a law exempting him from arrests—for debt\r\nit is supposed—for ten years, and commissioning him a captain in the\r\nColonial service. The supposition that Crogan was a spy in the service\r\nof the French was based upon the idea that he was a Roman Catholic,\r\ninasmuch as he was born in Dublin, Ireland. His loyalty was first\r\nbrought into question by Governor Sharpe, in December 1753, who wrote to\r\nGovernor Hamilton, informing him that the French knew every move for\r\ndefence made in the Colonies, and asked his opinion of Crogan. In\r\nanswer, Governor Hamilton said: “I observe what you say of Mr. Crogan;\r\nand, though the several matters of which you have received information\r\ncarry in them a good deal of suspicion, and it may be highly necessary\r\nto keep a watchful eye upon him, yet I hope they will not turn out to be\r\nany thing very material, or that will affect his faithfulness to the\r\ntrust reposed in him, which, at this time, is of great importance and a\r\nvery considerable one. At present I have no one to inquire of as to the\r\ntruth of the particulars mentioned in yours but Mr. Peters who assures\r\nme that Mr. Crogan has never been deemed a Roman Catholic, nor does he\r\nbelieve that he is one, though he knows not his education, which was in\r\nDublin, Ireland, nor his religious profession.” To keep the Indians\r\nloyal, he advanced many presents to them and the company of Indians he\r\ncommanded was fitted out at his own expense; and it was the attempt to\r\nget what he advanced on that occasion that led to his quarrel with the\r\ncommissioners and his resignation.\r\n\r\nFrom Philadelphia, Pa., he went to Onondago, in September, 1756, and\r\nsoon after was appointed deputy-agent, and again he took an active part\r\nin Indian affairs. After the French had evacuated Fort Duquesne, in\r\n1758, Crogan resided for a time in Fort Pitt. From there he went down\r\nthe river, was taken prisoner by the French, and taken to Detroit. Soon\r\nafter his liberation he went to New York, where he died in 1782.\r\n\r\nThus ended the career of George Crogan, who was an old acquaintance of\r\nGeorge Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         EXTRACTS FROM AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHIES.\r\n\r\n                      BY DR. MICHAEL F. SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of a people, like the history of the literature of a people,\r\ndepends upon the historian’s accumulation and verification of knowledge\r\nand the manner in which this knowledge is presented to the reader.\r\n\r\nIt would be an extraordinary thing, indeed, if all writers of history\r\nand biography were to speak and write the truth; it would still be a\r\nmost remarkable condition if many people would overcome their prejudices\r\nand recognize the truth when they saw it.\r\n\r\nIt is lamentable to see how persons of the best intentions will let\r\nthemselves be deceived when they have taken a false position and try to\r\nmaintain it.\r\n\r\nSome British and pro-British writers have taken a prejudiced position\r\ninto which they will admit only such truthful ingredients as meet their\r\nviews and shut out all the rest; just as much truth, as much sincerity,\r\nas much justice, as will allow them to call themselves fair and\r\nunbiased. It cannot be said that all act wittingly and purposely, but it\r\nseems to be the favorite practice of many writers of American history\r\nand biography to write events and conditions as they would like to have\r\nhad them occur rather than as they really were.\r\n\r\nWhat real historian, or writer of historical truths, will deny to the\r\nCelts the credit due them for the wonderful part taken by them in the\r\nconstructing, upbuilding and general welfare of our great country? What\r\npeople have done more than the warm-hearted and susceptible Celts, the\r\nhereditary fervor of their patriotism, the sacrifices which they have\r\nmade and which—unchecked by defeat and disappointment, and hope\r\ndeferred—they are daily making for their country and every country of\r\ntheir adoption; their Celtic veneration for ancient usages, and more\r\nthan Celtic tenacity of ancient recollections; above all, their still\r\nunextinguished spirit of nationality and imperfect amalgamation even to\r\nthis day with English interests and English feeling, could not fail, one\r\nwould suppose, to find an echo in the heart of the most prejudiced\r\nwriter of history. England has not only stolen the country of the Celt,\r\nbut she has often stolen her genius. The biographical history of Ireland\r\ncannot be contemplated without pride and satisfaction to every one who\r\nfeels an interest in her glory and sympathy with her sufferings.\r\n\r\nReduced to a condition of slavery such as no other nation on earth has\r\nendured—her name a by-word—her miseries a mockery—herself the\r\namphitheatre upon which the dishonest ministers of England exhibited\r\ntheir games of blood and rioted in drunkenness and corruption,—it is,\r\nnevertheless, consoling to discover that from her condition she has\r\npartially recovered and is not completely cursed, but that the master\r\nspirits whom she produced may well take their stand beside the highest\r\nminds of any other nation, whether in poetry or literature, in eloquence\r\nor statesmanship, in camp or court.\r\n\r\nOppression, however it may debase the physical and mental energies of a\r\npeople, cannot thoroughly destroy them; those very periods that to the\r\nordinary observer seem less likely to be illuminated by distinguished\r\nminds, genius has often most splendidly adorned.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stopford Green, in her book, “The Making and Undoing of Ireland,”\r\nsays: “There is no more pious duty to all of Irish birth than to help in\r\nrecovering from centuries of obloquy the men of noble birth, Irish and\r\nAnglo-Irish, who built up the civilization that once adorned their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n“It is by the study of this history alone that Irishmen will find a just\r\npride restored and their courage assured. In this effort, however,\r\nIrishmen are confronted with a singular difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHN O’SULLIVAN, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  Of New York City.\r\n\r\n  A Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“In no other country in the world has it been supposed the historian’s\r\nbusiness to seek out every element of political instability, every trace\r\nof private disorder, every act of personal violence, every foreign\r\nslander and out of these alone neglecting all indications of industry or\r\nvirtue to depict a national life.\r\n\r\n“Irish annals are still in our own days quoted by historians as telling\r\nmerely the tale of a corrupted land,—feuds and battles, murderings and\r\nplunderings; with no town or church or monastery founded, no law\r\nenacted, no controversy healed by any judgment of the courts. If the\r\nsame method had been found for England, what an appalling story we\r\nshould have had of that mediæval time, of its land-thefts, its women\r\nlifting, its local wars, the feuds handed from father to son with their\r\ncountless murders and atrocious devastating for generations whole\r\ncountry sides.\r\n\r\n“The Irish have long been famed for their love of learning. By their\r\nmissionaries they gave to the English the alphabet and the Christian\r\nfaith. When the English made returns by breaking the Irish schools and\r\ndestroying their libraries, they were still forced to recognize the\r\ntalents of the people—‘sharp-witted lovers of learning, capable of any\r\nstudy to which they bend themselves,’ lovers of music, poetry and all\r\nkinds of learning.”\r\n\r\nBancroft says, in Volume 5, in referring to the Irish in 1763: “Their\r\nindustry within the kingdom was prohibited or repressed by law, and then\r\nthey were calumniated as naturally idle. Their savings could not be\r\ninvested on equal terms in trade, manufactures or real property; they\r\nwere called improvident. The gates of learning were shut on them and\r\nthey were derided as ignorant. In the midst of privations they were\r\ncheerful. Suffering for generations under acts which offered bribes to\r\ntreachery, their integrity was not debauched; no son rose against his\r\nfather, no friend betrayed his friend. Fidelity to their religion, to\r\nwhich afflictions made them cling more closely, chastity, and respect\r\nfor the ties of family remained characteristics of the down-trodden\r\nrace.”\r\n\r\nGordon’s Civil War in Ireland speaks of the literature of Ireland as\r\nfollows: “The literature of Ireland has a venerable claim to antiquity;\r\nfor, as has been already mentioned, in the centuries immediately\r\nfollowing the introduction of Christianity, many writers arose, whose\r\nworks principally consist of lives of Saints, and works of piety and\r\ndiscipline, presenting to the inquisitive reader many singular features\r\nof the history of the human mind. The chief glory of the ancient Irish\r\nliterature, arises from the revival of the rays of science, after it had\r\nalmost perished in Europe, on the fall of Roman Empire in the west. The\r\nAnglo-Saxons, in particular, derived their first illumination from\r\nIreland; and in Scotland, literature continued to be the special\r\nprovince of the Irish clergy, ’till the thirteenth century.”\r\n\r\nGreece and Egypt, in very remote antiquity, were seminaries of learning\r\nto the rest of the world; and Ireland, in latter days, seems to have\r\nanswered the same description to the other nations of Europe. When the\r\nravages of the Goths and Vandals had desolated the improvements of\r\nEurope, and reached also to a considerable extent on the African\r\ncontinent, learning appears to have flourished in Ireland. Spencer says\r\nit is certain that Ireland had the use of letters very anciently, and\r\nlong before England; he thought they were derived from the Phœnicians.\r\nBede speaks of Ireland as the great mart of literature, to which they\r\nresorted from all parts of Europe. He relates that Oswauld, the Saxon\r\nKing, applied to Ireland for learned men to instruct his people in the\r\nprinciples of Christianity. Camden says, it abounded with men of\r\nsplendid genius, in the ages when literature was rejected everywhere\r\nelse; according to him and others, who wrote at the same time, the\r\nabbeys Luxieu in Burgundy, Roby in Italy, Witzburg in Frankland, St.\r\nGall in Switzerland, Malmsbury and Lindisfern in England, and Jona in\r\nScotland, were founded by Irish Monks. The Younger Scaliger, and others,\r\nsay, at the time of Charlemagne, and two hundred years before, almost\r\nall the learned were of Ireland. The first professors in the University\r\nof Paris were from this Island; and the great Alfred even brought\r\nprofessors to his newly founded college of Oxford from this country. It\r\nwould be too tedious to enumerate the benefits diffused through various\r\nparts of Europe, by the numbers of distinguished and learned men from\r\nIreland, who imparted the early lights of Science and of Christianity,\r\nand founded monasteries in various parts of Britain, France and Italy.\r\nAt this day, the Patron Saints, as they are called, of several nations\r\non the continent, are acknowledged to be Irish; hence we may see, how\r\nIreland obtained the name of Sanctorum Patria. We have also the\r\ntestimony of venerable Bede, that, about the middle of the seventh\r\ncentury, whole flocks of nobles and other orders of the Anglo-Saxons,\r\nretired from their own country into Ireland, either for instruction, or\r\nfor an opportunity of living in monasteries of stricter discipline; and\r\nthe Scots (as he styles the Irish) maintained them, taught them, and\r\nfurnished them with books, without fee or reward; “a most honorable\r\ntestimony,” says Lord Lyttleton, “not only to the learning, but likewise\r\nto the hospitality and bounty of that nation.” Dr. Leland remarks, “that\r\na conflux of foreigners to a retired Island, at a time when Europe was\r\nin ignorance and confusion, gave peculiar lustre to this seat of\r\nlearning; nor is it improbable or surprising, that seven thousand\r\nstudents studied at Armagh, agreeable to the accounts of Irish writers,\r\nthough the seminary of Armagh was but one of those numerous colleges\r\nerected in Ireland, and the grand ruins of them, to this day, stand as\r\nso many learned monuments of the ancient and literary fame of the\r\ncountry. Ireland retained the name of Scotia, till so late as the\r\nfifteenth century, with the addition of Major, or Vetus, to distinguish\r\nit from Caledonia or Albania, that is, the present Scotland, which, in\r\nthe eleventh century, began to be called Scotia Minor, as deriving its\r\nimprovement immediately from hence. The ancient Scotch writers, of the\r\ngreatest repute, are so far from denying their Irish extraction, that\r\nthey seem to glory it; and King James I, in one of his speeches, boasts\r\nof the Scottish dynasty being derived from that of Ireland.”\r\n\r\nThe dazzling array of Irish names by which the annals of America has\r\nbeen graced is far more extensive than the ordinary observer would\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\nTo some of the friendly and to all of the unfriendly a man to be Irish\r\nmust bear a pronounced Celtic name.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact from the most reliable authority that many Irish on coming\r\nto this country adopted English names, many taking the names of colors\r\nand trades. Dr. Thomas Dunn English says “they often took the names of\r\nBlack, Brown, Grey and Green, or as fancy may dictate.” He says “the\r\nnames were generally retained on this side of the Atlantic.” He also\r\nadds: “In the eighteenth century as well as the latter part of the\r\nseventeenth century, Philadelphia, then the greatest commercial port,\r\nwas the spot of the greatest debarkation of the Irish hosts. While many\r\nremained in the east there was a time when the greatest portion pushed\r\ntheir way into the western wilds where the land could be had for the\r\nasking. They scattered themselves over the slopes of the great Allegheny\r\nrange and its various spurs and tributaries.”\r\n\r\nFrom Londonderry in New Hampshire down to Coloraine in the far south,\r\nDr. English says he found many Celtic names changed with the “Macs” and\r\n“O’s” dropped. He said: “If nevertheless all these names were blotted\r\nout and their place taken by those of English or German sound the\r\ncharacter of the original settlement would be known by the prevalence of\r\ncertain words and survival of certain customs.”\r\n\r\nSpencer, the historian, says: “Multitudes of laborers and husbandmen\r\nfrom Ireland embarked for the Carolinas. The first colony of these\r\nlocated in 1737 near Santee.” He also says “emigration to America was so\r\nheavy as to show the depopulation of whole country districts in\r\nIreland.” Ramsey, the historian of the Carolinas, declares “that of all\r\nthe European countries none has furnished this province with so many\r\ninhabitants as Ireland. Scarcely a ship,” he says, “sailed from any\r\nIrish port for Charlestown that was not crowded.” All this, he declares,\r\noccurred years and decades before the revolutions.\r\n\r\nJenkins, in his life of President Polk, says: “About the year 1735 two\r\nlarge parties from Ireland sought the wilds of America, one by the\r\nDelaware to Philadelphia and the other by Charlestown, South Carolina.”\r\n\r\nNew York World’s History of the United States says: “An Irish colony\r\nunder Ferguson settled in South Carolina in 1679.”\r\n\r\nThere was a combined movement of Celts, Catholic and Presbyterian and\r\nQuakers to South Carolina and of all the colonies sent out by the\r\nprolific isle none had greater Americans than the emigration between\r\n1750–’70.\r\n\r\nAt any rate it may challenge comparison with any other—Jackson, Calhoun,\r\nO’Kelly, O’Grady, Polk, Crockett, Houston, McDuffie, Adair, McKemy,\r\nMcWorter, O’Farrell, McNairy. All these are of Irish extraction and\r\nstill (some of them Americanized by dropping the O’ or the Mc) adorn the\r\nannals of their states or nation. If anyone had said, in 1692, that a\r\nBritish parliament could succeed in exiling thousands of Catholic and\r\nProtestant Irish in such a way as to make them fight side by side with\r\nCatholic Frenchmen and non-sectarian colonists against the United\r\nKingdom he would have been denounced as a fool. The wise men would have\r\ntold him that legislative folly might do wonders, but it could not work\r\nmiracles. Yet that is just what parliament accomplished, for scarcely\r\nwas the ink dry on the treaty of Limerick (which provided that Catholics\r\nshould enjoy in Ireland such rights as they had enjoyed in the reign of\r\nCharles II) when it was violated by a series of laws that now make\r\nhonest Englishmen blush. It is needless to repeat the black details.\r\nSays one British writer: “The laws were so many and so atrocious that an\r\nIrishman could scarcely draw a full breath without breaking a law.”\r\n\r\nGrimshaw’s History of the United States, 1821, says: “Philadelphia in\r\n1683, which was begun on the site of the Indian village, Coquanoc,\r\nderives its name from a city in Asia Minor celebrated in sacred history\r\nfor its having been the seat of an early Christian church. During the\r\nfirst twelve months of its foundation about a hundred houses were\r\nerected and, since that period, it has received a continual accession of\r\ninhabitants from Ireland and Germany.” It also says: “In the interval\r\nbetween 1730 and the period when this history will relinquish the\r\ndistinct colonial proceedings to conduct the narrative of a more sublime\r\nand awful period when individual interests combine and move forward with\r\na unity of action there was an annual influx of emigrants. These were\r\nprincipally from Germany and Ireland. The Irish and German people at an\r\nearly day brought the useful arts and manufactures into Pennsylvania.\r\nThe Irish and French emigrants had enjoyed a large share of civil\r\nliberty and boldly contended for total enfranchisement from regal\r\ndomination.”\r\n\r\nGrimshaw says, in relating an incident of the war of 1812: “Scenes of\r\nthe most distressing kind were occurring in the Chesapeake. It was now\r\nthat Admiral Cockburn was satiating his unmanly and unsoldierlike\r\npropensities in a species of warfare at once reflecting dishonor. At\r\nfirst his depredations were directed against the farm houses and seats\r\nof private gentlemen. These were plundered, their owners in the rudest\r\nmanner insulted, and cattle which could not be removed were wantonly\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n“Georgetown and Fredericktown were destroyed. The people of Frenchtown,\r\nafter firing a few shots, fled on the enemy’s approach with the\r\nexception of an old Hibernian, named O’Neil. This heroic citizen\r\ncontinued the battle alone, loading a piece of artillery and firing it\r\nhimself, until, by recoiling, it ran over his leg and wounded him\r\nseverely; and even then, exchanging his piece of ordnance for a musket,\r\nand limping away, he still kept up a retreating fight with the advanced\r\ncolumn of the British. He was, at length, made prisoner, but soon\r\nafterwards released.” Holmes (Annals of America) says: “From Dec. 31,\r\n1728, to Dec. 31, 1729, there entered the port of Philadelphia 5,655\r\nIrish immigrants, 243 Germans, 267 English and Welsh and 43 Scotch.”\r\n\r\nRev. S. F. Hotchkin, in Penn’s Greene Country Towne, writes: “In 1729\r\nMiss Elizabeth McGawley, an Irish lady, brought hither tenantry to the\r\nDickson property between Nicetown and Frankford and had a chapel there.\r\nA priest named Michael John Brown was buried in a stone enclosure not\r\nfar away. Roman Catholic services may be traced, as Watson says, to a\r\nletter of Penn to Logan, in 1708, wherein he mentions that Mass had been\r\ncelebrated in Philadelphia and that the services were held in a frame\r\nbuilding on Cor. of Front and Walnut Sts.”\r\n\r\nThe _New York Sun_, in commenting on Galletin, says his sponsors were\r\nJohn Smilie, Blair McClenachan, and Thomas McKean, sturdy leaders of the\r\nstrong Philadelphia Irish colony of that era, 1789.\r\n\r\nJohn Sanderson’s Biography (1823) of the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, says: “In Pennsylvania the Quakers reared the most durable\r\nmonuments of their fame, and advanced of their most elevated grade the\r\ninterests of their order. The freedom, liberality and benevolence of\r\ntheir policy invited among them, as well from the adjacent provinces as\r\nfrom Europe, a numerous population; and the industry of the German, the\r\nactivity and enterprise of the Irishman joined to the pre-existing order\r\nand economy of this province, raised it to a sudden height of prosperity\r\nwhich has been seldom equalled in the history of nations.”\r\n\r\nDrake, in his Landmarks of Boston, says: “About 1718 a number of\r\ncolonists arrived from Londonderry, Ireland, bringing with them the\r\nmanufacture of linen and the implements used in Ireland.”\r\n\r\nEarly records of the Town of Derryfield, now Manchester, N. H.,\r\n1751–’82, says: “On Sept. 23, 1751, at the call of John McMurphy, the\r\nproprietors, free-holders and inhabitants of Derryfield gathered at the\r\ninn of John Hall for the purpose of laying the foundation of\r\nself-government. Its early inhabitants were made up of Irish, who had\r\nbegun to settle within its bounds as early as 1718, mostly near Amoskeag\r\nFalls. About 100 families settled there at that time.”\r\n\r\nHarris’ Memorials to Oglethorpe (1841) says: “Governor Oglethorpe,\r\nfounder of the colony of Georgia’s Mother was Elenora Wall, an\r\nIrishwoman of Rogane, Ireland.” Charles Dempsey was an able assistant to\r\nGovernor Oglethorpe and did much to settle differences between Florida\r\nand Georgia. Under Governor Oglethorpe, as a military officer, was a\r\nPatrick Sutherland. That there were thousands of Irish settled not only\r\nin New Hampshire, Georgia, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, but Maine,\r\nVirginia, Massachusetts and New York, in colonial days, may be attested\r\nif we are to believe Prendergast in his book, “Cromwellian Settlement of\r\nIreland,” he says: “Thousands of Irish were sold into a kind of slavery\r\nby Cromwell to Massachusetts and the West India Islands from Ireland.\r\nBetween 1651 and 1655 over 6,000 boys and girls, namely from the south\r\nof Ireland, were shipped to those two ports.” It seems difficult for\r\nsome writers to give credit and justice to a people against whom they\r\nhave an unwarranted prejudice—prejudice stimulated by ignorance of facts\r\nor malice.\r\n\r\nAfter the quotations from the most reliable authorities as to the early\r\nsettlement of America in colonial days by the Irish, it is to be\r\nwondered at which of the afore-mentioned causes impelled the president\r\nof a great university to give credit to other peoples in the settlement\r\nand upbuilding of America and omit the important part taken by the\r\nIrish.\r\n\r\nWas it malice or ignorance that caused a gentleman holding one of the\r\ntwo highest positions in the United States government from\r\nMassachusetts, to give the Irish but partial credit in his paper,\r\n“Distribution of Ability in the United States,” published in the\r\n_Century_ Magazine? The honorable gentleman quotes Appleton’s\r\nEncyclopedia of Biography for his authority, which, if closely examined,\r\nit will be found that his time or vision must have been exceedingly\r\nlimited. A careful examination of the above authority will prove malice\r\nor ignorance or delegating the examination to some Celtophobe of the\r\nGoldwin Smith stamp. These writers can be truly accused of carelessness\r\nor credulity. The colonial settlers from Ireland did not claim to be\r\nanything but Irish,—God had not created at that time the new breed of\r\nhigher animals, the Scotch-Irish.\r\n\r\nMr. James McMillen of Cincinnati, Ohio, in the _New York Sun_, refers to\r\nan article of Dr. Lyman Abbot in the _North American Review_, in which\r\n“he (Dr. Abbot) declares that the great forces which contribute to our\r\ncivilization in this country are not Celtic, Slavic, Mongolian or\r\nAfrican, but Anglo-Saxon.” Mr. McMillen adds: “From the very beginning\r\nwe have been in the front ranks with our Anglo-Saxon brethren and will\r\nnot be crowded out at this late day by any authority who would place us\r\nin the same category with the African, Mongolian or Slavic so long as we\r\ncontinue to demonstrate our equality if not superiority to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon.” The Abbots, Lodges, Eliots, Fisks and other minor\r\nsatellites will find it an impossibility to eliminate from the pages of\r\nAmerican history the absolutely necessary part taken by the Celt in the\r\noriginating and perpetuating American liberty, institutions and ideals.\r\nThe misinformers of history should stop to consider that civilization is\r\nnot made up only of heat or cold, light or darkness, but a community of\r\nhuman beings, with likes and dislikes, with hopes and aspirations, with\r\nhearts beating with passion or sentiment and while human peculiarities\r\nare modified to a certain degree by condition and environment, they are\r\nnot wholly changed. This will apply to the early Irish and English\r\nsettlers of America. It would be a very uncertain belief to suppose that\r\nthe thousands of Irish who settled in America in colonial days to escape\r\nthe lauded Anglo-Saxon civilization, would tamely submit to a\r\ncontinuance of it in this broad land of liberty and opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe Celt came to America to better his condition and not for\r\nexploitation and plunder; and his splendid sentimental and kindly nature\r\ndid have a modifying effect on the character of the brutal Saxon and if\r\nmuch of the land of America in colonial days was claimed as the land of\r\nthe Saxon the sun that gave it national heat and light was Celtic love\r\nof God, Celtic love of justice, Celtic valor, Celtic zeal, Celtic\r\nintelligence that made it the greatest country on earth.\r\n\r\nHe who has read American history has read it in vain, if he does not\r\nknow that had it not been for the moral and physical aid given by not\r\nonly the Irish colonists, but by the people of Ireland, American\r\nindependence would not have been achieved. Washington, himself,\r\nacknowledged publicly the great indebtedness to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe admirers of the prefix and hyphen in American history probably had\r\nin mind the attempts of that brilliant young Irish scientist, John\r\nButler Burke, to produce life artificially. The preface to Burke’s book,\r\n“Origin of Life,” somewhat changed, is “Although it is not the object of\r\nthis book to lend support to the doctrine of abiogenesis or the\r\ndevelopment at the present day of living from absolutely non-living\r\n(Scotch-Irish) matter, the more hopeful, though as it must be admitted\r\nless gratifying view to take is that we have arrived at a method of\r\nstructural organic synthesis of artificial (Scotch-Irish) cells, which\r\nif it does not give us organic life such as we see around us, gives us,\r\nat least, something which, according to (Eliot, Lodge, Fisk and others)\r\nadmits of being placed in the gap, or, as it might be preferably called,\r\nthe borderland between living and dead matter.” Dr. Burke says: “The why\r\nand wherefore we may ask, but get no answer to; the how is our only\r\nconsolation; and even in that do the most careful steering to avoid the\r\npitfalls and precipices of error.”\r\n\r\nThe afore-mentioned “historians” did not share Dr. Burke’s doubt, but\r\nwent ahead and created a new set of cellular tissue and called it the\r\nScotch-Irish. With characteristic zeal and industry begotten of their\r\nlove of justice and fair play, “that the world may know” a Murray, a\r\nLinehan, a Roache, a Gargan and hosts of others of beloved memory have\r\nshed lustre on Ireland not only as men of Irish blood but as\r\ndisseminators of historical truths as to the priceless part taken by men\r\nof Irish blood from the earliest days of the country’s history until the\r\npresent time for the permanency of American institutions and government.\r\nIn no man’s heart do the Stars and Stripes awake a more sincere and\r\nardent patriotism than the Irish-American.\r\n\r\nRev. Edward Everett Hale writes in the _Boston Daily Advertiser_,\r\nJanuary, 1852, the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n               “PROPORTIONS OF ORIGINAL RACES IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “In writing these letters to the _Boston Daily Advertiser_, I\r\n  attempted to confine myself to the facts which directly affect\r\n  legislation or charitable action. There is, however, a curious\r\n  question as to the effect to be produced on national character by\r\n  intermixture of blood and race, produced by such large emigration as\r\n  we see. What I have said in my last letter has been carefully guarded,\r\n  so as to refer everywhere to the absolutely unmixed Celtic race. Of\r\n  its value intermixed I have spoken as highly as I could.\r\n\r\n  “An anxious question is asked, however, by men of the old American\r\n  blood, whether there is not an over-preponderance of the Celtic\r\n  element coming in upon us? I do not profess to answer the question,\r\n  how far the origin of the native American blood is Celtic.\r\n\r\n  “In what proportions do the Celtic and Gothic or Germanic elements\r\n  mingle in the Englishman of today (1852) and, of course, in the\r\n  American of today? Dr. Kombst estimates in 1841 that there are of pure\r\n  German blood in England 10,000,000. Of mixed blood where the Teutonic\r\n  prevailed in England and the northeast of Ireland, 6,000,000. Of mixed\r\n  blood, where the Celtic prevailed in England, Scotland and Ireland,\r\n  4,000,000. And of pure Celtic in Scotland, Wales and Ireland,\r\n  6,000,000.\r\n\r\n  “But Dr. Lantham, with more reason, I think, doubts the purity of any\r\n  Germanic blood in England, saying that ‘a vast amount of Celticism,\r\n  not found in our tongue, very probably exists in our pedigrees.’ And\r\n  in another place he says that in nine-tenths of the displacements of\r\n  races made by conquest the female half ancestry of the present\r\n  inhabitants must have belonged to the beaten race.\r\n\r\n  “I think the history of the Saxon invasions is such as to give color\r\n  to this idea in the case of England. And I am not sure, but what it\r\n  could be made out, that the American people, before the recent Irish\r\n  invasion, showed in their proportion of black-haired men of dark\r\n  complexion and other Celtic signs that as large a fraction as\r\n  two-thirds of its blood ran in the dark ages of the past in Celtic\r\n  veins. If this be so, if the proportion, two-thirds Celtic to\r\n  one-third Gothic or Germanic, is the proportion which makes up that\r\n  ‘perfect whole,’ the ‘true American,’ which considers itself so much\r\n  finer than either of the ingredients, the recent emigrations furnish a\r\n  happy co-incidence with the original law. For five past years the\r\n  arrivals at New York, which are three fourths the whole, and represent\r\n  it in kind exactly, have been 547,173 Irish; 278,458 Germanic; 153,969\r\n  English and Scotch; 71,359 others. Now keep these 71,359 ‘others’ for\r\n  condiments in the mixture. There are Norwegians and French, Belgians\r\n  and Spaniards, Swiss and Italians, balanced against each other (and a\r\n  few Magyars).\r\n\r\n  “The English, of course, we need not count; but of pure Celts and pure\r\n  Germans we have to fraction just two to one; and in that proportion\r\n  are they to affect the blood of the American people.\r\n\r\n  “This computation which I had prepared before I read a courteous\r\n  article in the _American Celt_ of January 24, 1852, will, perhaps,\r\n  show to the writer of that paper, that we are not so far apart in our\r\n  views as he supposed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. James Anthony Froude, in his history of Ireland, maligned the Irish\r\npeople and did much to prejudice the world against them. Previous to his\r\ndeath he tried to undo the injustice he had done them. The following\r\nletter from Mr. Philbrick, superintendent of schools, explains itself:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Donohue’s Magazine_, August, 1855, taken from _Boston Transcript_\r\n  letter by Mr. Philbrick, superintendent of schools in Boston.\r\n\r\n  “James Anthony Froude, in his recent rapid passage across the country\r\n  on the homeward stretch of his round-the-whole trip, was interviewed\r\n  in New York and among other things was asked for reminiscences of his\r\n  visit to the United States.\r\n\r\n  “The reading of the notice of his interview revived the memory of an\r\n  incident of that visit, which is perhaps worth relating.\r\n\r\n  “During this visit, Mr. Froude delivered lectures in the principal\r\n  cities on the Irish question. The theory which he propounded and\r\n  advocated was, that the troubles in Ireland were not the result of bad\r\n  government at all, but of bad blood in the Irish race. But he was\r\n  anxious to get more light on the subject, if possible, and so, when in\r\n  Boston, he wanted to visit public schools which were frequented by\r\n  children of the Irish race. Accordingly, I took him to some boys’\r\n  schools and some girls’, where the children were almost wholly of\r\n  Irish parentage. At the last of these girls’ schools, of the grammar\r\n  grade installed in a splendid new school house of large size, after\r\n  passing through twelve or fourteen rooms, filled with bright,\r\n  well-dressed girls full of animation in their recitation in the\r\n  various branches of instruction, Mr. Froude asked: ‘Do you mean to\r\n  says that these are the children of Irish immigrants?’ ‘Yes,’ I\r\n  answered, ‘I believe there is not a single pupil in this school of the\r\n  Yankee race.’ ‘Well,’ he continued, ‘I must confess I’m staggered.’\r\n  ‘Now,’ said I, ‘I will take you to a mixed school (boys and girls\r\n  being in separate rooms and classes), which stands on a spot that two\r\n  years ago was a mud hole in a marsh surrounded by poor dwellings,\r\n  mostly occupied by Irish immigrants.’\r\n\r\n  “After passing through most of the rooms in the fine building, in\r\n  which were neatly-dressed pupils in the most perfect order, earnestly\r\n  engaged in their work, we came to a boys’ room where a recitation in\r\n  history was in progress. Here he took a seat and proceeded to question\r\n  the class, from which he got very prompt and appropriate answers. At\r\n  length, he singled out a little tan-headed boy of the Irish\r\n  nationality and plied him with a lot of pretty hard questions, but\r\n  every one was answered with admirable promptness and accuracy. Mr.\r\n  Froude stopped, remained silent for a short time with his eyes cast\r\n  down as though in a profound study. He then addressed the boys again\r\n  and said: ‘My boys, where did you learn this?’ ‘Out of a book, sir,’\r\n  was the ready reply. ‘And where did you get the book?’ ‘Out of the\r\n  public library,’ was the answer.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Froude then arose to leave and I said: ‘Now, Mr. Froude, I will\r\n  take you to the Girls’ High School, where you will find\r\n  representatives of the Irish nationality in a higher grade of\r\n  instruction.’ ‘Well,’ replied Mr. Froude, ‘you may take me where you\r\n  please; it makes no difference; I’m full; I can’t hold any more.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nSpencer says: “The Irish had the use of letters long before the English,\r\nand that Oswald, a Saxon king, applied to Ireland for learned men to\r\ninstruct his people.”\r\n\r\nCamden says: “Ireland abounded with men of genius and erudition when\r\nlearning was trampled on in every other quarter of the globe.”\r\n\r\nPlutarch calls Ireland, “Ogygia,” _i.e._, the most ancient isle.\r\n\r\nRalph Waldo Emerson says: “The sources from which tradition derives\r\ntheir stock are mainly three. And, first, they are of the oldest blood\r\nin the world, the Celtic. Some people are deciduous or transitory.\r\n\r\n“Where are the Greeks? Where the Etrurians? Where the Romans?\r\n\r\n“But the Celts or Sidonides are an old family, of whose beginning there\r\nis no memory and their end is likely to be still more remote in the\r\nfuture; for they have endurance and productiveness. They planted\r\nBritain, and gave to the seas and mountains names which are poems and\r\nimitate the pure voice of nature.\r\n\r\n“They are favorably remembered in the oldest records of Europe. They had\r\nno violent feudal tenure, but the husbandman owned the land. They had an\r\nalphabet, astronomy, priestly culture, and a sublime creed and\r\nprecarious genius. They made the best popular literature of the middle\r\nages in the songs of Merlin and the tender and delicious mythology of\r\nArthur.”\r\n\r\nThe most ancient manuscripts in the world are in the Irish language and\r\nthe oldest Latin manuscripts were written by an Irishman.\r\n\r\nThe Irish language is as old as Hebrew and more ancient than Greek or\r\nLatin.\r\n\r\nMatthew Arnold made the statement: “If Celticism had not moulded England\r\nshe would not have produced a Shakespeare.”\r\n\r\nThere were a few Irishmen evidently in business in Boston before 1847–8.\r\nThe Columbian Centennial of May 12 and March 17, 1812, gives James\r\nMagee, owner of Coffee Exchange House; William Barry, Dealer in Hats and\r\nFurs; William Sullivan, Corn Hill Square, Sale of farms; J. L. Sullivan,\r\nManager of Merrimac Boating Co.; William Sullivan’s orations for sale;\r\nJames Barry, Fish, Pork and Lard Dealer; Walter Welsh, Real Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE IRISH IN RHODE ISLAND, TO AND INCLUDING THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n                 BY JOHN J. COSGROVE, PROVIDENCE, R. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it was first suggested to me that I prepare a paper dealing with\r\nsome phase of the history of the Irish in America I decided that I would\r\ntake as my subject the history of the Irish in Rhode Island up to the\r\npresent time. My belief was that the part played by the men and women of\r\nIrish birth or descent in the early history of our state was so slight,\r\nand the facts relating thereto so meagre, that I could in a few words\r\ndeal with the early history of the Irish in Rhode Island, and could pass\r\non to their history for the last three-quarters of a century.\r\n\r\nUpon beginning my researches I was at once convinced of my mistake and\r\nsoon learned that if I adhered to my original intention, instead of\r\npreparing a short paper I would be obliged to write a large volume.\r\nTherefore, I have taken as my subject: “The history of the Irish in\r\nRhode Island to and including the Revolution,” with the hope that some\r\nabler Irish man or woman will, at some future time, tell the story of\r\nthe part played by the men and women of Irish birth or extraction in the\r\nmodern history of the “lively experiment” of Roger Williams.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the history of the Irish in America it is not our\r\nintention to belittle the work of others, or to steal from other nations\r\nthe glories of their achievements; neither are we seeking to dim the\r\nlustre of the Puritan crown, nor to call our own the mighty deeds of the\r\npioneer Pilgrims who landed in New England and conquered the wilderness.\r\nWe have no desire to turn Plymouth Rock into a Blarney Stone. We are not\r\ngoing to assert that Roger Williams was the grandson of Fin Mac Cumbal,\r\nor that the clam was first planted in Narragansett Bay by the founder of\r\nClan McFadden.\r\n\r\nOur object is simply to record the deeds of the men and women of our\r\nrace in the making of America; to enable Americans to judge us in true\r\nperspective; to tell the world what we Irish have done and are doing in\r\nthe upbuilding of this state and nation. We are trying to bring to the\r\nminds of the country a knowledge of the fact that we have been here from\r\nthe beginning, that we have given our service and our lives for the\r\npromotion of America’s happiness, that, by our brain, by our brawn, by\r\nour courage, tenacity of purpose, morality, we have fairly earned the\r\nright to the highest and best that America can offer to its devoted sons\r\nand daughters. We seek to tear away the veil of ignorance that has\r\nblinded many to our worth and to bring into relief a better picture of\r\nour race that has too often been falsely depicted. We are proving our\r\nclaim, not by appeals to race prejudice or bigotry, but by\r\nincontrovertible evidence. In the words of the American-Irish Historical\r\nSociety, we are laboring “that the world may know.”\r\n\r\nThere is a very erroneous impression in the minds of many, even in this\r\nenlightened age, that the struggle for liberty in Ireland has been a\r\nreligious struggle, a struggle for the principles of Catholicity and for\r\nthese principles alone. Our fight is not a religious fight. It is the\r\nfight for the liberties of a race, not a religion; for the right of a\r\ndistinct, ethnic entity to work out its salvation in the way best suited\r\nto its temporal needs. “Nations have no hereafter, their reward must be\r\nof this world”; neither have they religions as nations.\r\n\r\nMany are also of the opinion that unless a man or woman is a Catholic he\r\nor she is not Irish, though bearing an Irish name. Thus we see people of\r\nother faith with the name of Sullivan or Murphy classed as\r\n“Scotch-Irish,” that race with no existence, repudiated alike by Irish\r\nand Scotch, and which someone has called the “Equinoctial Gael.”\r\n\r\nAnother fact to be borne in mind in connection with Irish names is that\r\nmany Irish men and women have come to America, and particularly to New\r\nEngland, who, for one reason or another, bore names distinctly un-Irish.\r\nWhy this is so will be explained later.\r\n\r\n\r\n                FIRST TRACE OF THE IRISH IN NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nThe first trace of the Irish in New England of which we have any record\r\nis found in the story of the “Mayflower.” In his book, “Brave Little\r\nHolland and What She Taught Us,” Rev. William Elliot Griffiths says: “In\r\nthe Mayflower were one hundred and one men, women, boys and girls as\r\npassengers, besides captain and crew. These were of English, Dutch,\r\nFrench and Irish ancestry.” History has established beyond the\r\npossibility of doubt that Priscilla Mullins and John Alden were both\r\nIrish.\r\n\r\nPlymouth was founded in 1620. William Bradford, governor of the colony,\r\ntells us that a ship arrived at Plymouth, 1626–7, and a large number of\r\npassengers, “cheefe among these people was one Mr. Fells and one Mr.\r\nSibsie, which had many servants belonging unto them, many of them being\r\nIrish.”\r\n\r\nIn Winthrop’s Journal it is stated that on March 15, 1636, a ship\r\narrived “called the Saint Patrick, belonging to Sir Thomas Wentworth,\r\nDeputy of Ireland, one Palmer, Master.”\r\n\r\nSoldiers of Irish birth or extraction had made their mark in the\r\ncolonies as early as the Pequot War, among them Darby Field and Daniel\r\nPatrick or Gilpatrick. Field is mentioned as having explored the White\r\nMountains in 1642 with a band of Indians. (Winthrop’s Journal and\r\nSketches of Early Irish Settlers by Linehan.)\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to turn to the history of England for an explanation\r\nof why so many Irish came to this country, beginning in 1641, and why\r\nsome of them did not bear Irish names.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles First there occurred what is known as “The\r\nRevolution of 1641.” At that time many of the gentry of the west of\r\nIreland held their lands under what parliament claimed a defective\r\ntitle. Charles, after promising the Irish that we would remove the cloud\r\non their title, immediately went back on his word, and, in order to give\r\nhis conduct some show of justification, had thousands of Irish men and\r\nwomen tried on an absurd charge of treason and their lands and goods\r\nconfiscated. The history of England, gleaned from the records of the\r\nHouse of Commons, tells us that in two days over two thousand Irish were\r\nindicted, “tried,” convicted and sentenced for treason, or one for each\r\none and one-half minutes in a working day of twelve hours; a fair sample\r\nof English “justice” in Ireland. The English army overran Ireland,\r\nslaughtered a very large number of men, women and children, besides\r\nshipping many thousands to New England as slaves. These exiles were\r\nobliged to change their names and adopt English names.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Charles First, Cromwell started a similar crusade in\r\nIreland. He also caused to be sent to the colonies many thousands of\r\nIrish boys and girls who were given names different from those of their\r\nfathers. Cromwell also shipped large numbers of adults to the colonies\r\nfrom Ireland where they were sold as slaves. In 1652, the Cromwell\r\nCommission recommended that “Irish women as being too numerous now be\r\nsold to merchants and transported to ... New England.” In 1653 Captain\r\nJohn Vernon contracted with Messrs. Selleck and Leader for 250 women of\r\nthe Irish nation and 300 men “to transport them into New England”; these\r\nto be secured in the country within twenty miles of Cork, Youghal,\r\nKinsale, Waterford and Wicklow.\r\n\r\nThe women thus sold into slavery were to be given in marriage to the\r\ncolonists, as it was impossible to get English women to emigrate to the\r\ncolonies willingly. Sales were conducted and each man paid for his wife\r\nas he did for his chattels at public auction. An interesting account of\r\nthe manner of conducting these sales may be found in the histories of\r\nVirginia and in a popular book of fiction of a few years ago: “To Have\r\nand To Hold.”\r\n\r\nSo brisk was this trade for a time that finally the ship owners, in\r\ntheir greed, forcibly abducted some English women and children, and this\r\nled to the stopping of the traffic.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, some reason for the fact that many people of\r\nundoubted Irish origin did not bear Irish names, some of them taking the\r\nnames of their owners, and others dropping their Irish names to save\r\nthemselves from persecution. In addition to this, no ship could clear\r\nfor the colonies from an Irish port. She must first proceed to an\r\nEnglish port and thence outward. When she did clear all her passengers\r\nwere required by law to adopt some name other than an Irish one. Lest I\r\nbe accused of romancing I will quote the law of England of the time:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES THOMPSON, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  Of Louisville, Ky.\r\n\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for Kentucky.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “An Act that Irishmen dwelling in the counties of ... go appareled\r\n  like Englishmen, and wear their beards after the English manner, swear\r\n  allegiance, and take English sirnames; which sirnames shall be of one\r\n  town, as Sutton, Chester, Trim, Skyrne, Corke, Kinsale; or colors, as\r\n  white, black, brown; or arts or sciences, as smith, carpenter; or\r\n  office, as cook, butler, etc., and it is enacted that he and his issue\r\n  shall use this name under pain of forfeyting his goods yearly.”\r\n  (Paternalism with a vengeance. If the law had required him to wear a\r\n  monocle in his left eye the picture would have been complete, and\r\n  instead of building railroads he could have married an American\r\n  heiress.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can from this easily perceive the policy of England: to wipe out from\r\nthe minds of the Irish all thoughts of nationality, and to exterminate\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\nMany of these exiles, of course, obeyed the law, as being along the\r\nlines of least resistance. The banished children did not even know their\r\nright names; and thus we see the names of Smith, Carpenter, Chester,\r\nSterling, Kinsale, White, Butler, etc., borne by Irishmen. We shall also\r\nsee that names distinctly Irish were found in Rhode Island at that\r\nperiod, demonstrating one of two things, or perhaps both: that many of\r\nthe Irish were smuggled out of the country without touching at English\r\nports, and that many others, on arriving in this country, resumed their\r\noriginal names.\r\n\r\nThe popular histories of England and the colonies make no note of these\r\nfacts, but there is a more reliable source than the histories for\r\nconfirmation of these assertions, and that is the records of England. It\r\nis one of the established customs of English law to sacredly preserve\r\nall papers of this character, and it is from these, even more authentic\r\nthan histories, that we have discovered the facts.\r\n\r\nThomas Hamilton Murray, late Secretary-General of the American-Irish\r\nHistorical Society, has compiled a list of Irish names in the records of\r\nRhode Island, giving the years in which the men were known to have lived\r\nhere. These are all strictly Irish names and exclude those of doubtful\r\norigin:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Larkin, Dunn, 1655; Casey, 1663; Kelly, Macoone, 1669; Heffeman, 1671;\r\n  Martin, Macarthy, Long, 1677; Devett, 1685; Malavery, 1687; Dailey,\r\n  1689; Linniken, 1690; Cary, 1693; Dring, 1696; Doyle, 1698; Higgins,\r\n  1699; Moore, 1700; Walch, Mitchell, 1703; Coursey, 1713; Murphy, 1718;\r\n  Lawless, 1720; Carty, 1721; MacKown, 1723; O’Harra, 1728; Phelon,\r\n  1730; Shay, Joyce, 1731; Connor, Cassidy, 1732; Gallagher, 1736; Lyon,\r\n  Mackey, 1737; Hurley, McCane, Sullivan, 1740; Whelan, 1741; McGonegal,\r\n  Delaney, Farrell, Mulholland, Rourk, 1742; Dempsey, Fitzgerald, 1743;\r\n  Hanley, Egan, McDonald, 1745; Donnelly, Tally, Byrn, 1747; Lanahan,\r\n  Maguire, 1750; O’Brien, Donovan, Barrett, 1751; Cavenaugh, Flynn,\r\n  Murray, Hickey, 1752; Hartagan, 1753; McMullen, 1754; Burke, 1755;\r\n  Dwyer, O’Neil, Ryan, 1756; Magee, Donohue, 1758; Sheehan, Hearn,\r\n  McGrath, 1759; Mullen, 1760; Gorman, Lary, Dermott, Fitzpatrick, 1761;\r\n  Dunphy, 1765; Carroll, 1768; Roach, 1773; Mahoney, Rohan, 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are all names of people who lived in Rhode Island prior to the\r\nAmerican Revolution. When such a large number of names is found in the\r\nrecords it is but fair to assume that there were many others to us\r\nunknown and who lived and died without ever having their names recorded\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nIn the early history of New England there were of course no directories\r\nof names, few, if any, records of births, marriages or deaths, and\r\npractically the only time when men’s names were written was in time of\r\nwar or public danger, and it is in war that we first find the names of\r\nany large number of Irishmen in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE IRISH IN KING PHILIP’S WAR.\r\n\r\nKing Philip’s War started in 1675 and was begun for the purpose of\r\nending the rule of the white man in the colonies. Time will not admit of\r\na detailed account of the part played by the Irish in that terrible\r\nconflict and only passing mention can be made.\r\n\r\nAgain taking the writings of Thomas Hamilton Murray (“Irish Soldiers in\r\nKing Philip’s War”) we find the names of one hundred and fourteen men of\r\nundoubted Irish birth or descent. I have verified these names. The list\r\nexcludes the names of doubtful origin. It is to be borne in mind that\r\nthe men who wrote the names were, in many instances, guided largely by\r\nsound, owing to the inability of the bearer of the name to spell it\r\ncorrectly, or at all. The list follows:\r\n\r\n  Benjamin Barrett.\r\n  James Barrett.\r\n  John Barrett.\r\n  Peter Bennett.\r\n  William Blake.\r\n  John Bolen.\r\n  John Boyd.\r\n  Alexander Boyle.\r\n  John Brandon.\r\n  James Briarly.\r\n  Richard Brine.\r\n  Robert Bryan.\r\n  William Buckley.\r\n  Richard Burke.\r\n  Joseph Butler.\r\n  Phillip Butler.\r\n  Stephen Butler.\r\n  James Callan.\r\n  Daniel Canada.\r\n  John Cann.\r\n  James Carr.\r\n  John Cary.\r\n  Peter Cary.\r\n  John Casey.\r\n  John Clary.\r\n  Lawrence Clinton.\r\n  Joseph Collins.\r\n  Robert Corbett.\r\n  Richard Coy.\r\n  Timothy Cunnell.\r\n  John Davis.\r\n  Thomas Davis.\r\n  John Day.\r\n  William Day.\r\n  Hugh Drury.\r\n  John Drury.\r\n  James Ford.\r\n  Samuel Gary.\r\n  Thomas Gery.\r\n  John Gleeson.\r\n  Phillip Gleason.\r\n  John Good.\r\n  Daniel Gowen.\r\n  Matthew Griffin.\r\n  Richard Griffin.\r\n  John Hand.\r\n  James Harrington.\r\n  Lawrence Hart.\r\n  John Harvey.\r\n  William Harvey.\r\n  Sylvester Hayes.\r\n  John Healey.\r\n  Nathaniel Healey.\r\n  William Healy.\r\n  Daniel Herrington.\r\n  Joseph Holland.\r\n  James Hughes.\r\n  Matthew Hurley.\r\n  John Jackson.\r\n  Phillip Keane.\r\n  Lawrence Kellon.\r\n  Michael Kelly.\r\n  John Kennedy.\r\n  Henry Kenny.\r\n  Thomas Kenny.\r\n  Peter King.\r\n  John Lane.\r\n  Peter Lane.\r\n  John Larkin.\r\n  Edward Larkin.\r\n  Timothy Larkin.\r\n  Phillip Long.\r\n  John Lyon.\r\n  Thomas Lyon.\r\n  Charles Macarthy.\r\n  Daniel Magennis.\r\n  John Malone.\r\n  John Maloney.\r\n  William Manley.\r\n  Nicholas Manning.\r\n  Thomas Manning.\r\n  John Martin.\r\n  David Mead.\r\n  Peter Mellardy.\r\n  Daniel Moore.\r\n  Edward Moore.\r\n  Joseph Moore.\r\n  Patrick Moran.\r\n  Darby Morris.\r\n  Brian Murphy.\r\n  James Murphy.\r\n  Arthur Neale.\r\n  Jeremiah Neale.\r\n  Richard Nevill.\r\n  John Norton.\r\n  David O’Kelly.\r\n  James Read.\r\n  John Read.\r\n  Edward Reade.\r\n  John Riley.\r\n  James Ross.\r\n  Joseph Sexton.\r\n  Dennis Sheehy.\r\n  Thomas Tally.\r\n  Hugh Taylor.\r\n  Jeremiah Toye.\r\n  Daniel Tracy.\r\n  Daniel Warren.\r\n  Thomas Warren.\r\n  James Welch.\r\n  Phillip Welch.\r\n  Thomas Welsh.\r\n  Lawrence White.\r\n  Joseph Winn.\r\n\r\n“Richard Brine” in the above list is undoubtedly Richard O’Brien,\r\n“Daniel Canada,” Daniel Kennedy; and “John Cann,” John McCann. There are\r\nmany other names in the records who may have been Irish, like Owens,\r\nStewart, etc., but these are not claimed.\r\n\r\nOne Henchman was among the captains of the colonists in the campaign\r\nagainst Philip at Mount Hope. In his command were Joseph Ford, John\r\nBarrett, Daniel Magennis, a corporal, John Good, John Cann, or McCann,\r\nJoseph Lyon, William Healy, Daniel Kennedy, John Moore, Patrick Moran,\r\nWilliam Manley and others.\r\n\r\nHenchman marched to Dedham, along with a troop of cavalry under\r\nPrentice, thence to Attleborough and Swanzey, where they joined Captain\r\nMosley. All then proceeded against Philip at Mount Hope. In Mosley’s\r\ncompany were Richard Nevill, Joseph Sexton, Edward Reade, Samuel Lane,\r\nRichard Brine, probably O’Brien, Thomas Welch, Peter Lane and Philip\r\nKeane.\r\n\r\nIn Captain Wadsworth’s company were Matthew Hurley, James Ford, Robert\r\nCorbett, James Stuart and William Lyon.\r\n\r\nUnder Captain Lathrop were William Buckley, Edward Moore and Stephen\r\nButler.\r\n\r\nMajor Willard’s command included Thomas Tally, Phillip Read, John\r\nBarrett, John Healy, Daniel Gowen, John Gleeson.\r\n\r\nJoseph Winn was in Captain Wheeler’s company; John Riley, Thomas Davis,\r\nSylvester Hayes and Arthur Neale, in Captain Appleton’s. John Lane, John\r\nand William Day served under Captain Poole.\r\n\r\nIt was also necessary to garrison the towns and settlements to protect\r\nthe women and children from prowling Indians. Among those who did this\r\nperilous work were John Cary, James Carr, John Malone, John Larkin,\r\nDaniel Kennedy, Thomas Owen, Timothy Larkin, John Boyd, Thomas Welch,\r\nJoseph Griffin, Brian Murphy, James Harrington.\r\n\r\nIn Captain Davenport’s company were Nathaniel Henly, John Drury, Daniel\r\nHarrington, Jeremiah Toye, Patrick Moroney. Moroney is also mentioned as\r\nhaving served under Captain Oliver; and Cornelius Davis is reported in\r\nMosley’s company.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Swamp Fight, which took place at South Kingstown on\r\nDecember 19, 1675, we find Captains Mosley, Prentice, Davenport,\r\nAppleton and Oliver, and as shown above, all these commands contained\r\nmany Irish.\r\n\r\nIn that fight Philip had assembled an army of three thousand warriors,\r\nand had laid in his winter’s supplies, with the determination to hold\r\nhis position. We find the colonists wading through fifteen miles of snow\r\nin the middle of winter and dislodging him; and if the history of the\r\nIrish race on the battlefield proves anything it is fair to assume that\r\nthe Irish were not in the rear. The Swamp Fight was the beginning of the\r\nend to Philip’s hopes.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1676, one Captain Michael Peirce had an engagement with a band\r\nof Indians at Pawtucket. His force was wiped out and massacred. Two days\r\nlater the Indians crossed the Seekonk River and fell upon the\r\ninhabitants of what is now Rumford. The old histories tell us that when\r\nthe Indians approached “Ye Irishman, Robert Beers, was sitting at a\r\nwindow reading ye bible. He was warned of ye approach of ye Indians and\r\ntold to fly. He refused to move, saying that ‘he who was engaged in\r\nready Holy Writ would not be molested by ye enemy.’” The story goes on\r\nto say that “ye Indians, disregarding ye biblical injunction,\r\nincontinently scalped ye Irishman Robert.” Robert was a mason by trade,\r\nand is the first Irishman of whom we have any record in the present town\r\nof East Providence.\r\n\r\nThe war ended in 1676, on the murder of Philip at Mount Hope. The\r\nIndians had devastated the entire colony. Crops were destroyed, or had\r\nnot been planted. There was neither food nor clothing. Nine hundred men\r\nhad fallen. Homes had been razed and starvation stared the colonies in\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\nAnd here we see again of what the Irish are made. We see the people of\r\nIreland collecting money, food and clothing and fitting out the ship\r\n“Katherine” and sending her to the relief of the colonies. History calls\r\nthis the “Irish Donation.”\r\n\r\nFreeman, the historian, in mentioning the fact, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It is somewhat remarkable that from ‘divers Christians’ in England\r\n  and Wales no word of cheer greeted the suffering colonists, and no\r\n  contribution, save that of Ireland, is recorded in this dark and\r\n  perilous period.” Continuing he says: “It is worthy of particular\r\n  notice, to the honor of humanity, that in the time of the distress of\r\n  the Plymouth and Massachusetts colonies, by reason of the wars, when\r\n  few families remained that were not in mourning for the loss of some\r\n  relative, and whose pecuniary embarrassments pressed upon them, the\r\n  donation from Ireland to which we referred ‘for the relief of the\r\n  impoverished, distressed and in necessity by the war’ was received. We\r\n  record with pleasure this noble instance of benevolent sympathy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBailies, in “History of New Plymouth,” says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Ireland was the only place in the British European dominions which\r\n  bestowed any relief on the suffering colony.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a full account of the above see “Bodge’s Writings on King Philip’s\r\nWar”; Publications of the New England Historic, Genealogic Society;\r\nHistories of Rhode Island and the Colonies; Writings of Thomas W.\r\nBicknell, and many other authorities therein cited.\r\n\r\nIn the records of the State of Rhode Island we learn that Michael Kelly\r\nwas a prominent man in the island of Conanicut as early as 1667. Michael\r\nwas apparently a Quaker, and was one of a committee of three formed in\r\nthat year for the purpose of defence against the Indians.\r\n\r\nOne of the founders of the town of East Greenwich was Charles Macarthy.\r\nHe was afterwards given five thousand acres of land by the General\r\nAssembly for services in King Philip’s War.\r\n\r\nMatthew Watson, another Irishman, was one of the most prominent\r\ninhabitants of the town of Barrington as early as 1722. His history has\r\nbeen written by Mr. Bicknell.\r\n\r\nThe present town of Warren was named in honor of Sir Peter Warren, an\r\nIrishman.\r\n\r\nAnother prominent family in the life of Rhode Island from the beginning\r\nto the present is that of Dorrance. We shall meet them again.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE IRISH AND BROWN UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\nWhat is perhaps the most interesting of all, interesting because it\r\ndeals with the intellectual life of the state, is the story of the part\r\nplayed by the Irish in the founding and maintaining of our most noted\r\ninstitution of learning, Brown University.\r\n\r\nI was always under the impression that if there was one institution in\r\nthe making of which we Irish had no part, that institution was the\r\ncollege on the hill; and when I first read that the first money\r\ncontributed for its founding was obtained in Ireland, I confess that I\r\naccused the writers of deserting the field of fact and entering the\r\nrealm of romance. Subsequent investigation, however, convinced me that\r\nthe claims of the Irish were established beyond peradventure, no less an\r\nauthority than the records of Brown itself proving our case.\r\n\r\nTo go back a little before the founding of the college, history tells us\r\nof eight Irish schoolmasters who taught in Rhode Island during the\r\neighteenth century. Rev. James MacSparran, Rev. Marmaduke Brown, Stephen\r\nJackson, “Old Master” Kelly, Knox, Crocker, Terrence Reilly and John\r\nPhelan.\r\n\r\nMacSparran was an Irishman who settled here about 1718. For forty years\r\nhe was pastor of St. Paul’s Church in Narragansett, where he taught many\r\npupils at his home, among them Thomas Clapp, afterwards President of\r\nYale.\r\n\r\nRev. Marmaduke Brown, the son of Rev. Arthur Brown, a native of\r\nDrogheda, county Louth, Ireland, where his mother was also born, was the\r\nRector of Trinity Church, Newport. He also had a school there. In 1763\r\nhe had a school of thirty, fifteen of each sex. He was a member of the\r\nfirst Board of Fellows of Rhode Island College, now Brown University.\r\n\r\nStephen Jackson, a native of Kilkenny, came to America in 1724. In 1762\r\nhe was living on Benefit Street. One of his grandsons was for years town\r\nclerk of the town of Providence, and one of his great-grandsons was\r\nGovernor of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n“Old Master Kelly” taught school at Tower Hill, South Kingstown, for a\r\ngreat many years. Among his pupils was Oliver Hazard Perry, who, we\r\nclaim, was the son of an Irish mother. I have not gone into the ancestry\r\nof Commodore Perry in detail, as the proper place for the treatment of\r\nthat subject is the history of the Irish Rhode Islanders in the war of\r\n1812.\r\n\r\n“Before 1800, Messrs. Knox and Crocker, natives of Ireland, taught\r\nschool at Bowen’s Hill (Coventry) and the neighborhood.” (Cole’s History\r\nof Washington and Kent Counties.)\r\n\r\nTerrence Reilly and John Phelan were schoolmasters in the time of the\r\nRevolution, but after the founding of the college.\r\n\r\nBut the first man who ever caused the idea of a college to take definite\r\nshape was none other than the ablest educator of them all, the Irish\r\nbishop, George Berkeley, who was born in Kilkenny. He started for\r\nAmerica in 1729 for the purpose of educating and Christianizing the\r\nAmerican Indian. He arrived in Newport in the same year. His first idea\r\nwas to establish a college in Bermuda, but he soon changed his plan and\r\ndetermined to establish it in this state. His plans did not mature and\r\nhe returned to Ireland. Shortly after his return he sent to Yale College\r\nthe best collection of books ever received in this country up to that\r\ntime. He also gave to the college a deed of his farm of ninety-six acres\r\nin Rhode Island, to be held by trustees for the support of three\r\nscholarships, to be bestowed upon the best classical scholars. The Rhode\r\nIsland farm was rented in 1762 for a period of 999 years, and the Dean’s\r\nBounty, as the fund is called, is still in existence and devoted to the\r\nsame purpose. He also contributed to the libraries of Harvard, King’s\r\nCollege (now Columbia University), and the Redwood Library of Newport.\r\nHe was a famous scholar and poet and is best known as the author of the\r\nline:\r\n\r\n              “Westward the star of empire takes its way.”\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Foster, librarian of the Providence Public Library, says of\r\nhim (in speaking of the founding of Brown): “By thus anticipating by a\r\nthird of a century the actual establishment of a college in Rhode\r\nIsland, his plans unquestionably had an important bearing on the steps\r\nleading up to it.”\r\n\r\nIn 1762 the Philadelphia Baptist Association determined to form a\r\ncollege in Rhode Island. Rev. Morgan Edwards and Rev. Samuel Jones were\r\nplaced in charge of the movement. The institution was incorporated in\r\n1762 and was at first in Warren. In 1770 it was removed to Providence\r\nand the name was changed to Brown University in 1804.\r\n\r\nDoctor Guild in “The First Commencement of Rhode Island College” says:\r\n“It is a singular and well-known fact ... that the first funds of the\r\ncollege were obtained from Ireland, in guineas and half-guineas, from\r\nMary Murphy, Susanna Pilson, Joseph Fowke and other members of\r\nProtestant churches and societies in Cork, Waterford, Belfast,\r\nBallymony, Coleraine, Londonderry and Dublin. This may be accounted for\r\nwhen we learn that Mr. Edward’s first settlement in the ministry, before\r\ncoming to this country, was in Cork, where he married his wife (Mary\r\nNunn). The original subscription book, with genuine signatures, is one\r\nof the most interesting documents on file in connection with the history\r\nof the University.”\r\n\r\nMorgan Edwards went to Ireland and England in 1767. The list of his\r\nIrish contributors is a long one, and not all were Protestants. There\r\nwere several Catholic contributors, as shown by the histories of the\r\nfamilies in Ireland, still extant. Some of those who contributed were\r\nMary Murphy, Matthew O. Dwyer, Francis Macarthy, Humphrey Crowley,\r\nSamuel Neale, Mrs. Luke Kelly, Rachel Connor, John Reilly, James Martin,\r\nSamuel McCormick, James Brennan and many others.\r\n\r\nIn 1769–70, Rev. Hezekiah Smith solicited funds for the college in South\r\nCarolina and Georgia. Among his contributors were Malachi Murfee, Edward\r\nDempsey, Charles Reilly, Patrick Hinds, James Welsh, Hugh Dillon, John\r\nBoyd, Matthew Roach, John Canty and many others.\r\n\r\nSomeone has said that the names on the payrolls of the publications\r\ncontrolled by James Gordon Bennett remind one of a Fenian Roster. With\r\nas much truth could it be said that the names of the contributors to\r\nBrown University in its infancy would be taken for the chief marshal and\r\nhis staff in a St. Patrick’s Day parade in Providence.\r\n\r\nWilliam Edwards, son of Morgan, was graduated from Brown in 1776.\r\nMarmaduke Brown was a member of the first Board of Fellows. Another\r\ngraduate of Brown and afterwards one of its Board of Governors was John\r\nDorrance. George Dorrance and his two sons, George and James, came from\r\nIreland between 1715 and 1720, and settled in the town of Foster. John\r\ngraduated from Brown and was afterwards president of the Providence Town\r\nCouncil for sixteen years.\r\n\r\nTime will not admit of any further treatment of the history of Brown and\r\nI will close this part by mentioning the names of only a few of the\r\ngraduates of Irish birth or ancestry in its early history: James\r\nSullivan, brother of Major-General John Sullivan, received the degree of\r\nLL. D. in 1779; John Meredith Read, LL. D., John Mackie, A. B. 1800, M.\r\nD. 1813; Andrew Mackie, 1814; Joseph Mulliken, 1817; John Sharp\r\nMaginnis, 1844; Joseph Moriarty, 1830; Mark D. Shea and James G.\r\nDougherty, 1865.\r\n\r\nWe see from this brief account that the Irish race has done its part in\r\nthe making of Brown. From its inception until today hundreds of its\r\ngraduates of Irish birth or descent have left its halls and have gone\r\nforth into the world, doing honor to their race and to their _alma\r\nmater_. At present it numbers among its students many men and women of\r\nthat race. The President of the Class of 1910 in the Women’s College is,\r\nI understand, a namesake of mine, Miss Lillian Ruth Cosgrove.\r\n\r\nWe are proud of the part played by our people in the history of Brown,\r\nproud of its sons and daughters of our race. We are confident that some\r\nday an Irish graduate of Brown will tell the world the whole story of\r\nthe Irish chapter in the history of Rhode Island; and may we not hope\r\nthat in the not far distant future we will see on the campus on the\r\nhill, along with the statues of Marcus Aurelius and others, a monument\r\nperpetuating the memory of the Irish men and women who made the dream of\r\nthe Irish Bishop Berkeley a living fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n                IRISH RHODE ISLANDERS IN THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the greatest event in the history of our state and\r\nnation, the American Revolution. We have heard and read so much about\r\nthe colonists throwing off the yoke of the “mother country” that it\r\nwould seem to be necessary to determine who is entitled to the credit of\r\nbeing called the “mother country.”\r\n\r\nWashington, Lee, Franklin, Custis and others, all men of English\r\ndescent, tell us that one-half of the continental army was Irish.\r\nGalloway, Mountjoy and Robertson reported to England the same fact.\r\nGalloway stated to a committee of the British House of Commons that:\r\n“There were scarcely one-fourth natives of America; about one-half\r\nIrish, the other fourth were English and Scotch.” We do not claim that\r\nGalloway’s testimony was entirely trustworthy, and it is only quoted\r\nhere in corroboration of the testimony of the others.\r\n\r\nIn the story of the part played by the Irish Rhode Islanders in the\r\nRevolution I have carefully omitted names of doubtful origin and have\r\nconfined myself to those whose nationality cannot be questioned.\r\n\r\nIn 1765 Rhode Island opposed the Stamp Act. In 1766 a Liberty Tree was\r\nplanted in Newport. In 1768 a similar event took place in Providence. In\r\n1772 the “Gaspee” was attacked in the Providence River. Her commander\r\nwas wounded and Dr. Henry Sterling, an Irishman, lent him assistance. In\r\n1775 James and Alexander Black, two Irishmen, were leading merchants in\r\nProvidence. On May 4th, 1776, the people of Rhode Island formally\r\nrenounced allegiance to England, two months before the signing of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe records in the State House and elsewhere show that some three\r\nhundred soldiers of Irish birth or extraction enlisted from this state.\r\nI have been conservative in my estimates and have excluded names which\r\nmay have been English, Irish or Scotch, as Carpenter, Chester, etc.,\r\nalthough, as we have seen, these were as likely to be Irish as anything\r\nelse. A detailed list of these names may be found in Murray’s “Irish\r\nRhode Islanders in the American Revolution.” That publication also gives\r\nthe names of the Irish who enlisted in the Massachusetts, New Hampshire\r\nand Connecticut regiments. These add several hundred more. In this\r\ncollection of names we find Bennets, Boyds, Carrolls, Caseys, Cooneys,\r\nDaleys, Donohues, Dorrances, Fitzgeralds, Gallaghers, Hanleys, Hogans,\r\nLarkins, Mahoneys, McCarthys, McDonalds, McNamaras, Murrays, Morans,\r\nO’Briens, Murphys, Sullivans, Tracys, Watsons and Wrights. We also find\r\nthe three Irish fighting names: Kelly, Burke and Shea. These are only\r\nsome of the names found which include about every Irish name imaginable.\r\n\r\nLikewise we find the names Blake, Bowen, Carr, Cummings, King, Harvey,\r\netc., but these are of doubtful origin and are not claimed by us.\r\n\r\nHenry E. Knox, one of Washington’s generals, the son of an Irishman,\r\nvisited Rhode Island in 1776 and laid out certain forts at Newport.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war Washington ordered two invading armies into\r\nCanada. One of these was commanded by Richard Montgomery, a native of\r\nRaphoe, County Donegal, Ireland. The other was commanded by Benedict\r\nArnold. In these armies were many Irish Rhode Islanders. Captain Simeon\r\nThayer of Providence organized a company for the expedition. In it were\r\nJohn Barrett, John Carrell, Edward Connor, Thomas Garey, Patrick\r\nHannington, James Hayden, Cornelius Higgarty, Edward Mulligan, John\r\nRyan, Patrick Tracy and James Welch.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ward of Westerly also had a company on the expedition and this\r\nincluded Thomas Dougherty and John Hickey. Captain Topham of Newport had\r\nmany Irish in his command. In this campaign every regiment from the\r\ncolonies contained numerous Irish soldiers, as shown by the muster\r\nrolls.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1776 Washington ordered General Sullivan to the support\r\nof the armies in Canada, assigning six regiments to his care. Owing to\r\nthe death of the commander-in-chief before Quebec the mission of\r\nSullivan was a failure. Sullivan’s regiments contained a large number of\r\nIrish soldiers, but as we are concerned only with the Irish in Rhode\r\nIsland it is not necessary to mention all their names here.\r\n\r\nSullivan was given command of the army in Rhode Island in 1778. Under\r\nhim were Generals Lafayette and Greene, each commanding one-half of the\r\narmy, with Sullivan Commander-in-Chief. The object of Washington was to\r\nemphasize the alliance with France by making a successful attack on the\r\nBritish forces, military and naval, aided by the French fleet. Every\r\nschoolboy knows the result of that campaign. How its complete success\r\nwas rendered impossible by a storm off Point Judith and how Sullivan,\r\nLafayette and Greene saved their forces from disaster by their masterly\r\ntactics. With Sullivan were his two brothers, James and Eben, and the\r\nmuster rolls of the regiments in the Rhode Island campaign read like the\r\nDirectory of the Ancient Order of Hibernians.\r\n\r\nI have purposely omitted to go into detail as to the history of the two\r\ngreatest Irishmen in the Revolution, Major General John Sullivan, and\r\nCommodore Barry, “the Father of the American Navy.” My object has been\r\nto record the deeds of the Irishmen who fought in the ranks rather than\r\nto try to add lustre to those two men. Enough has been written of them.\r\nTheir story and their work are well known.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to mention the names of only a few Irish Rhode Islanders\r\nwho took part in the different battles of the Revolution:\r\n\r\n\r\n  George Dorrance was an ensign in the Regiment of Providence in the\r\n  “Army of Observation.” George Dorrance, probably the same, was, in\r\n  1780, lieutenant of the second company of Scituate. Again we find the\r\n  name as captain, in 1781, in a regiment raised by act of the General\r\n  Assembly and again we read of a George Dorrance commissioned Major in\r\n  the Third Regiment of Militia.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Henry Sterling, the Irish surgeon, is stated as “being in hearty\r\n  sympathy with the revolution and aided the patriot cause with his\r\n  advice and professional services.” He was born in Londonderry,\r\n  Ireland.\r\n\r\n  Patrick Tracy of Thayer’s company was killed before Quebec and Hagerty\r\n  and Hayden were wounded. In Colonel Elliot’s regiment were John\r\n  McCarthy, Cornelius Sullivan, John McCoy, John Lyon and Daniel Conway.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Hughes, known as “gallant Thomas Hughes,” was Irish, a captain\r\n  in the Revolution and a major in the War of 1812. Many articles have\r\n  been written about him, and as there are some of his descendants\r\n  living today, who have told of him better than I can do, I will pass\r\n  him with this brief mention. Miss Mary A. Greene, one of his\r\n  descendants, is a prominent Rhode Island writer and scholar.\r\n\r\n  William Ennis became a sergeant in Sherburn’s command. William Lawless\r\n  was a captain. William McCoy was a quartermaster in Colonel\r\n  Christopher Greene’s command. Rev. Erasmus Kelly lost his household\r\n  effects in Warren by pillage. James Foster, a native of Dublin, with a\r\n  name that would not indicate his Irish origin, “enlisted for the war.”\r\n  John Harrington was an ensign in Sheldon’s company. Elizabeth O’Brien\r\n  was a nurse. The name “Ensign M. Carthy,” probably Ensign McCarthy,\r\n  appears as among those of Israel Angell’s regiment. John Tracy was an\r\n  aide-de-camp on the staff of General Glover on the island of Rhode\r\n  Island under Sullivan. William Lawless, probably the person mentioned\r\n  before, was made captain in 1778 under Colonel Crary. Edward Ross was\r\n  an ensign in the Second Infantry Company of Westerly. William Creed\r\n  became a captain. John Larkin was, in 1776, a member for Hopkinton of\r\n  the “committee to procure arms and accoutrements.”\r\n\r\n  In the Rhode Island regiments at Yorktown were Dennis Hogan, sergeant;\r\n  John Butler, sergeant; Michael Kelly, Cornelius Driscoll, William\r\n  Sullivan, Nicholas Hart, Matthew Hart, Michael Doherty, Peter Burns,\r\n  James Hayes, Thomas Mitchell, Charles McAfferty, Michael Wright, John\r\n  Kirby, Matthew Henly, Christopher Moore, Anthony Griffin, Daniel and\r\n  Peter Collins, William McCall, John Haney, James Mitchell, Thomas\r\n  Melony, Francis Cavan, Hugh McDonald, John McDonald and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Olney’s company, known throughout the colonies for its many\r\ndeeds of courage, was the first to scale the walls of Yorktown. It\r\ncontained many Irish, as shown by its rolls.\r\n\r\nAmong the men of Irish descent in Lafayette’s army were Count Arthur\r\nDillon, Aide-de-Camp Isidore de Lynch (who afterwards became the\r\ncommander of the Irish-French regiment of Walsh), Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nBarthelemy Dillon. Theobald Dillon also saw service in America and was a\r\nmember of the Cincinnati. Matthew Dillon also saw service here. M. de\r\nMcCarty was an officer with the French army at Newport and in the Rhode\r\nIsland campaign. Edward Stack, another Irishman, was with Rochambeau.\r\n\r\nSome of the other Irishmen who served in America with the French were:\r\nCommandant O’Neill, wounded at Savannah; Captain James Shee, Captain\r\nMacDonnall, Captain Mullens, Lieutenant Taaffe, Lieutenant Farrell,\r\nJames O’Moran, Lacy and Whalen. Charles Geoghegan, an Irishman in the\r\nFrench army, received the decoration of the Cincinnati at the hands of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nIn the navy we find the Irish race well represented. It is, of course,\r\nimpossible to tell whence these sailors and marines came, but we know\r\nthat they served.\r\n\r\nJohn Murphy of Rhode Island commanded a privateer. William Malone was\r\ncaptain of the _Harbinger_. Francis Mulligan was the owner of the\r\n_Chance_. Oliver Reed was master of the privateer _General Rochambeau_.\r\nPeter Day commanded the _Molly’s Adventure_. M. Mackey was the commander\r\nof the _Greyhound_.\r\n\r\nStephen Ready, John Welch, Edward McGrath, William Kelly, John Murphy\r\nand Charles Buckley, all of Rhode Island, were imprisoned in England.\r\n\r\nOn the sloop _Providence_ we find Patrick McMullen, Matthew McCaffray,\r\nBernard Gallagher; on the _Alfred_, Patrick McNamara, George O’Hara,\r\narmorer’s mate, Patrick O’Brien and William Burns; on the _Columbus_,\r\nEdward Burke, Lieutenant of Marines, Thomas Burns, surgeon’s mate, John\r\nMcLaughlin, Peter Morris, Charles McDonald, Arthur Nagle and Thomas\r\nMurray.\r\n\r\nMr. Field in his work, “Esek Hopkins, Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nContinental Navy, 1775 to 1778,” tells us that in Hopkin’s command were\r\nmany Irishmen, some of them being Anthony Dwyer, Richard Sweeney,\r\nPatrick Kaine, Thomas Doyle, John Connor, Andrew Magee, Thomas Dowd,\r\nJohn Roatch and George Kennedy.\r\n\r\nWe also find Captain Mellaly commanding a privateer and capturing the\r\nBritish sloop _Crawford_.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the names found in the records, but they show\r\nunmistakably the part played by the men and women of our race in our\r\n“Little Rhody” to and including the Revolution.\r\n\r\nSome reliable writers have stated that the officers of the continental\r\narmy were twenty-five per cent Irish. Some of them were Generals Stephen\r\nMoylan (first president of the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick of\r\nPhiladelphia), Henry E. Knox (first Secretary of War), John Shee, “Mad\r\nAnthony” Wayne, Matthew Irvine, Edward Hand, Richard Butler, Walter\r\nStewart and William Thompson; Colonels John Nixon, Sharp Delaney,\r\nCharles Stewart, John Patton, George Lattimer, Thomas Robinson, Barrett,\r\nSmith and Davis; Captain Parker and many others. As we have seen, there\r\nwere many officers of lesser rank, both in the army and the navy.\r\n\r\nAmong the first sea fights of the Revolution was the capture of the\r\nBritish sloop _Margaretta_ at Machias Bay on the coast of Maine, May\r\n11th, 1775, known as “The Lexington of the Seas.” The Americans were\r\ncommanded by Captain O’Brien, the son of a native of Ireland.\r\n\r\nCaptain Parker, killed at Lexington, was an Irishman, as were Colonels\r\nBarrett, Smith and Davis, who commanded at Concord. The monument at\r\nBunker Hill is covered with Irish names.\r\n\r\nThe two most famous women of the Revolution were Molly Pitcher and Nancy\r\nHart, both Irish.\r\n\r\nBut it was not alone in battle that our race distinguished itself. At\r\nValley Forge the army of Washington was in dire peril. The troops had\r\nneither food, clothing, shelter nor equipment. Disaster met them\r\neverywhere and failure threatened the patriot cause. Faultfinders and\r\nmalcontents were urging the giving up of the struggle. The hopes of\r\nWashington and his devoted band had almost disappeared, when thirty\r\nIrishmen of the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick of Philadelphia\r\nsubscribed six hundred thousand dollars. When we consider what that\r\namount of money meant in those days, is it not fair to assume that this\r\ncontribution was the real means by which the power of England was\r\nfinally driven from this continent? It entailed hardships and sacrifices\r\nwhich we cannot appreciate now. Robert Morris, a banker, and Blair\r\nMcClenachan gave fifty thousand dollars each. James Mease, a native of\r\nStrabane, County Tyrone, Ireland, and General Matthew Irvine gave\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars each and the other members subscribed the\r\nremainder.\r\n\r\nAmong the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence were\r\neleven of Irish birth or descent: John Hancock, William Whipple, Matthew\r\nThornton, John Hart, George Taylor, George Read, James Smith, Thomas\r\nMcKean, Charles Carroll, Edward Rutledge and Thomas Lynch.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence is in the handwriting of Charles\r\nThompson, a native of Londonderry. It was first read to the public in\r\nPhiladelphia by John Nixon, son of a native of Wexford and a member of\r\nthe Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick, and was first printed by John\r\nDunlap, a native of Strabane, county Tyrone, Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhen the colonists sought the assistance of France Bishop Carroll\r\naccompanied Benjamin Franklin to that country and it was due mainly to\r\nthe Bishop’s representations that French assistance was obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. ELMER J. RATHBUN.\r\n\r\n  Justice of the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n  A Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn all the battles of the Revolution, at Bunker Hill, Concord,\r\nLexington, Monmouth, Valley Forge and Yorktown, we did our part. In the\r\nhour of the nation’s peril we gave freely of our substance. We helped to\r\nkindle and keep alive the flame of liberty. Wherever and whenever men\r\nwere needed there were found Irish hearts and Irish hands ready to give\r\nup all for the establishment of free institutions, for the right of a\r\nnation to be free. Here at last we had found a country worth fighting\r\nfor and worth dying for. Here we had found the principle of individual\r\nliberty a living, throbbing thing. We have been true to America,\r\nwhatever our enemies may say; we are true to it today; and America knows\r\nthat if ever the liberties of the republic are threatened the Irish, of\r\nwhatever faith or political belief, will be found doing their part as of\r\nold.\r\n\r\nIn peace and in war we have done our part. We are doing it today and\r\nwill continue to do so as long as the fame of Washington and Lincoln\r\nendure. We stand for patriotism, for respect for just laws, for the\r\nsanctity of the marriage tie, for the purity of our homes, the education\r\nof our children and the morality of the people. S. Banks Nelson, an\r\nIrish clergyman of this state, has stated that we govern every nation\r\nbut our own. We also submit to government and the history of our own\r\ncity of Providence for the last few years has shown that religious\r\nbigotry or race prejudice are not failings of the Irish race in Rhode\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nAll we ask is our share of that reward that goes to labor well\r\nperformed. We ask to be treated justly. We do not claim office because\r\nwe are Irish and, on the other hand, we insist that office shall not be\r\ndenied us because of that fact. We have made mistakes and will make\r\nthem, but they are not fatal. We stand on our record as American\r\ncitizens and as such entitled to an equal share in its government. All\r\nwe ask is that you sympathize with us in our struggle, that you teach\r\nyour children some little knowledge of our history, that you learn to\r\nknow us as we are and not as we are sometimes represented. Above all we\r\nask you never to permit men or women, on the stage or elsewhere, to\r\nutter indecencies or obscenities in the name of our womanhood; for all\r\nmust admit that our women, by their matchless purity and virtue, are the\r\nhonor and glory of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN JOHN O’BRIEN OF MACHIAS, MAINE—REVOLUTIONARY HERO—A BIOGRAPHICAL\r\n                                SKETCH.\r\n\r\n     BY REV. ANDREW M. SHERMAN, LL. D., OF MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain John O’Brien, the subject of this sketch, was the third eldest\r\nson of Morris O’Brien and Mary O’Brien, and was born in 1750, in\r\nScarboro, on the Maine seacoast, about ten miles to the southwestward of\r\nPortland.\r\n\r\nAt the early period under present review, the region including Scarboro\r\nwas greatly harassed by the Indians, whose depredations are said to have\r\nsometimes been instigated by the French, who were jealous of the English\r\nsettlers in western Maine (then a part of the Province of\r\nMassachusetts), and hoped to thus drive out the English already there,\r\nand prevent others from coming into what was regarded as preëmpted\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the frequent attacks of the Indians upon the English,\r\nat Scarboro, it sometimes became necessary, as a means of\r\nself-preservation, for the settlers to flee into the surrounding\r\nwilderness, and there carefully secrete themselves until the savages\r\nshould depart from the vicinity; when they would return to their homes,\r\nwhich were sometimes found to have been despoiled and destroyed during\r\ntheir enforced absence.\r\n\r\nWhile John O’Brien was an infant in his mother’s arms, an attack upon\r\nthe English settlement at Scarboro, by the Indians, was threatened; and\r\nit was therefore resolved to flee for safety into the surrounding\r\nwilderness. Fearing that the crying of the infant would disclose to the\r\nsavages the direction to be taken by the settlers in their flight, and\r\nalso their chosen hiding-place, it was advised, and insisted that the\r\nmother leave her infant behind, in the settlement. Against this she\r\nearnestly protested, assuring her neighbors that she could keep the\r\ninfant quiet. She was, therefore, allowed to take the infant along.\r\nFolding him affectionately to her breast, and soothing him as only a\r\nfond mother could, she succeeded in keeping the infant quiet, not only\r\nduring their hasty flight but during their sojourn in the depths of the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nThis incident is related by the descendants of Captain John O’Brien as a\r\nmost impressive illustration of mother-love, which, indeed, it is. They\r\ncongratulate themselves also upon the fact that an infant who, on\r\nreaching manhood, became so famous as he as a patriot and as a\r\nsuccessful privateersman in connection with the Revolution; and so\r\nconspicuous, in later years, as a citizen and as a man of affairs,\r\nshould have been thus providentially preserved in tender infancy from\r\nthe hands of hostile Indians.\r\n\r\nTo the terrors of Indian depredations, experienced by the early settlers\r\nof Scarboro, were added those of extensive forest fires, which sometimes\r\ndevastated the entire region about them, and threatened their\r\nextinction.\r\n\r\nOf the boyhood of John O’Brien, in Scarboro, little has been preserved.\r\nHe must, however, have been different from other boys of his age, if he\r\ndid not, living in such close proximity to the water, acquire a fondness\r\nfor it. This much is certainly known; that in the autumn of 1765, when\r\nthe robust boy was about fifteen years of age, the entire family,\r\ncomprising Mr. and Mrs. O’Brien and six sons and three daughters,\r\nremoved to Machias, on the southeasterly coast of Maine; the father and\r\ntwo eldest sons having been down there on a prospecting trip, in a\r\nsailing vessel, during the previous year.\r\n\r\nFrom the arrival of the lad, John O’Brien, in Machias, until the\r\nbreaking out of the Revolution, little or nothing is certainly known\r\nconcerning him. That he attended school, for a time, at least; and that\r\nhe engaged in the usual sports of lusty boyhood, including swimming,\r\nfishing and boating, may be safely inferred. Neither is it a far-fetched\r\nconclusion, that, on attaining to a suitable age, he assisted his\r\nfather, and two eldest brothers, Jeremiah and Gideon, in the sawmills\r\nerected by them in Dublin, as the southern village of Machias was early\r\nnamed, and by which it is still known.\r\n\r\nThe Machias River, which separates the northern and southern villages of\r\nMachias, empties into Machias Bay, about four miles to the southeastward\r\nof the town; and the river, as far inland as Machias, is navigable for\r\nlarge vessels. Machias, therefore, was, and is a seaport town; and\r\nvessels of various kinds were constantly arriving and leaving. Machias\r\nearly became the shiretown of Lincoln County, now Washington County, and\r\nhence was a place of considerable importance. In the light of these\r\nfacts it is not surprising that most of Morris O’Brien’s “six strapping\r\nboys” were, in early life, at least, seafaring men; for from their\r\npeculiar environment they naturally acquired a taste for that sort of\r\nemployment. John O’Brien, as will be seen, devoted himself, in later\r\nlife, exclusively to commercial and mercantile pursuits, with excellent\r\nsuccess; indeed, had the acquisition of “filthy lucre” been his chief\r\nambition, he might easily have become one of the wealthiest men of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with the outbreak of the Revolution that the subject\r\nof this sketch first comes into public notice as a citizen and an ardent\r\npatriot; and as the war progressed, his fame as a privateersman\r\nincreased. His achievements as a privateersman have never received the\r\npublicity they unquestionably deserve; and it will be the aim of this\r\nsketch to acquaint the American reading people, so far as can be done in\r\nthe limited space allowed, with the story of the truly romantic career\r\nof this hitherto “unsung hero” of New England.\r\n\r\nJohn O’Brien, at the outbreak of the Revolution, was about twenty-four\r\nyears of age. He was fully six feet in height; and must have weighed at\r\nthat time not far from one hundred and seventy-five pounds. That he was\r\nwell endowed with force of character was amply demonstrated at the very\r\nopening of his public career; as an illustration of which it may be said\r\nthat none was more resolutely opposed to, nor more fearlessly outspoken\r\nagainst the repeated acts of tyranny of the mother country, than he. He\r\nwas a member of the first Committee of Safety appointed in Machias,\r\nafter the issuance of the proclamation of the Provincial Congress of\r\nMassachusetts, authorizing and requiring preparations and efforts to be\r\nmade incident to a state of hostility.\r\n\r\nAt the first recorded gathering of the Machias patriots, held in the\r\neast room of the Burnham Tavern,[21] John O’Brien was present, and gave\r\nhis hearty assent to the proposition for the erection of a liberty pole\r\nin the village, as a symbol of the freedom, for the achievement of which\r\nthe people of that then isolated frontier town were willing, if need be,\r\nto sacrifice their fortunes and their lives. In procuring, and afterward\r\nraising the liberty pole, young O’Brien played a unique and conspicuous\r\npart.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Moore, the gallant young Irishman commanding the British\r\narmed schooner “Margaretta,” then lying at anchor in the Machias River,\r\ncame on shore, and demanded that the liberty pole be taken down, John\r\nO’Brien, on behalf of the inhabitants, defiantly refused to accede to\r\nthe peremptory demand of the King’s officer, The following\r\nconversation[22] is said to have taken place:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Who erected this pole?” inquired Captain Moore, as he came ashore\r\n  from the “Margaretta”; to which the staunch Machias patriot, John\r\n  O’Brien, replied:\r\n\r\n  “That pole, sir, was erected by the unanimous approval of the people\r\n  of Machias.”\r\n\r\n  “Well, sir,” said Moore, “with or without their approval, it is my\r\n  duty to declare it must come down.”\r\n\r\n  “Must come down!” repeated O’Brien, with warmth. “Those words are\r\n  easily spoken, my friend. You will find, I apprehend, that it is\r\n  easier to make than it will be to enforce a demand of this kind.”\r\n\r\n  “What! Am I to understand that resistance will be made? Will the\r\n  people of Machias dare to disregard an order, not originating with me,\r\n  but the government whose officer I am?”\r\n\r\n  “The people of Machias,” replied O’Brien, “will dare do anything in\r\n  maintenance of their principles and rights!”\r\n\r\n  “It is useless to bandy words,” rejoined the officer, a little nettled\r\n  at the determined spirit manifested around him; “my orders are\r\n  peremptory, and must be obeyed. That liberty pole must be taken down,\r\n  or it will be my painful duty to fire on the town!”\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that rash act, however, Moore was dissuaded by a mutual friend; and\r\nthe liberty pole stood until it “rotted down!”\r\n\r\nTo John O’Brien, so it is said by some writers, belongs the honor of\r\nproposing, at a meeting of the Machias patriots, held in a private house\r\nsoon after the notable gathering in the Burnham Tavern, that Captain\r\nMoore be seized while attending the village church, on the following\r\nSunday; after which, in accordance with the well-conceived plan there\r\nagreed upon, the “Margaretta” was to be captured, also. In compliance\r\nwith young O’Brien’s expressed wish, he was chosen to be the principal\r\nactor in the proposed seizure of Moore.\r\n\r\nJohn O’Brien, as he subsequently stated, hid his gun under a board,\r\nbefore entering the church. He was expected, at a signal to be given by\r\none of the patriots outside of the church, to personally seize Captain\r\nMoore, when his compatriots were to come to his assistance. So far as\r\nyoung O’Brien was concerned, the preliminaries were well carried out.\r\nBecause of the vigilance and prompt action of the British officer,\r\nhowever, the plan for the seizure miscarried. Receiving timely warning\r\nof the trap into which he was being lured, he escaped from the church by\r\nway of a low, open window. On reaching his vessel, he was quickly\r\nassisted on board by an officer awaiting his arrival; and, after firing\r\na few shots over the villagers’ heads, for intimidation, he dropped down\r\nthe river to a place of safety.\r\n\r\nWhen it had been resolved by a few of the bolder spirits of Machias to\r\nattack and capture the “Margaretta,” by pursuing and boarding her, John\r\nO’Brien and his five brothers, Jeremiah, Gideon, William, Dennis and\r\nJoseph, were among the party of about thirty-five who sailed down the\r\nMachias River in the lumber sloop “Unity,” on that extremely hazardous\r\nundertaking. After the little American sloop had entered Machias Bay,\r\nand the “Margaretta” had been sighted, Jeremiah O’Brien was unanimously\r\nchosen to the command of the “Unity.”\r\n\r\n“The first man who boards her (the “Margaretta”) shall be entitled to\r\nthe palm of honor,” said Captain Jeremiah O’Brien, soon after taking\r\ncommand of the lumber sloop.\r\n\r\nAfter the “Margaretta” had been sighted in Machias Bay, where she was\r\nbecalmed, the American sloop was brought alongside of her. As the two\r\nvessels came together, the rigging of the “Unity” became entangled with\r\nthat of the British vessel. The two vessels had no sooner touched, than\r\nJohn O’Brien, who was standing at the bow of the “Unity,” leaped aboard\r\nthe “Margaretta.” Almost at the same moment, the American sloop, having\r\nno grappling-irons, the vessels suddenly parted and young O’Brien was\r\nleft alone on the quarterdeck of the British schooner. Seven Britishers\r\nalmost simultaneously fired at the intrepid Yankee boarder; but he was\r\nunhurt. The Britishers then charged upon O’Brien with their bayonets;\r\nand to save his life he jumped overboard and started to swim to the\r\nYankee sloop, which had then drifted about seventy-five feet away.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the side of the American sloop, John O’Brien was promptly\r\nassisted on board. As he stepped upon the deck of the “Unity,” his\r\nbrother, Captain Jeremiah, grasped him by the hand, exclaiming, as he\r\ndid so:\r\n\r\n“Brother John, you’ve won the palm;” and then addressing his men, he\r\ncontinued: “But man the sweeps, my hearties, and lay us alongside once\r\nmore, and stand ready to fasten on to him when you reach him.”\r\n\r\nFor the second time the two vessels came together; and this time, in\r\naccordance with orders, they were fastened together.[23] The\r\n“Margaretta” was boarded, and in an hour’s time was captured, and was\r\ntaken in triumph up the river to Machias, reaching the wharf at about\r\nsunset of the same day, which was the 12th of June, 1775. Captain Moore,\r\nthe gallant commander of the captured British vessel, was mortally\r\nwounded, and died next day in Machias.\r\n\r\nJohn O’Brien, as a recognition of the conspicuous bravery exhibited by\r\nhim in the capture of the “Margaretta,” was sent, by the Machias\r\nCommittee of Safety to the Provincial Congress, then in session at\r\nWatertown, Massachusetts, to officially inform that body of the\r\nbrilliant victory won, and to ask protection for the feeble settlements\r\nin eastern Maine, including Machias.\r\n\r\nThe news of the splendid victory in Machias Bay spread rapidly through\r\nthe Colonies, and everywhere the colonists were stirred with the\r\nambition to emulate the achievement of the Machias lumbermen.\r\n\r\nThe “Unity” was at once fitted out as a cruiser, the armament of the\r\n“Margaretta” being transferred to her. She was re-named the “Machias\r\nLiberty,”[24] and Captain Jeremiah O’Brien was appointed as her\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture, in July, 1775, of the British armed vessels\r\n“Diligence” and “Tapnaquish,” near Buck’s harbor, in which captures John\r\nO’Brien, on his brother Jeremiah’s vessel took part, the former vessel\r\nwas refitted as an American cruiser. Of the “Machias Liberty” (or\r\n“O’Brien”), Jeremiah O’Brien was continued as commander; and his younger\r\nbrother, William, was appointed First Lieutenant. John Lambert was\r\nappointed to the command of the “Diligence,” and John O’Brien was\r\nappointed as First Lieutenant. The “Diligence” had a crew of forty men,\r\nand carried eight guns and twenty swivels.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a year, the “Machias Liberty” and the “Diligence,” by order\r\nof the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts, cruised, chiefly up and\r\ndown the eastern coast, protecting American shipping, and capturing\r\nBritish prizes. John O’Brien contributed in no small measure to the\r\nsuccess of the cruise. Sometime in the early part of 1776 the\r\n“Diligence” was laid up; but the “Machias Liberty” was continued a few\r\nmonths longer in the Provincial service.\r\n\r\nDuring the night following its capture, the “Margaretta” was taken up\r\nMiddle River, a branch of the Machias River, a few miles, and there\r\nbeached.[25] “We cut down trees and bushes and enclosed her from view so\r\nmuch as we could and returned to Machias in season for a late\r\nbreakfast,” said one who took an active part in the disposal of the\r\ncaptured British schooner.\r\n\r\nEarly in the autumn of 1776, John O’Brien, and a few others, uncovered\r\nand floated the “Margaretta,” and brought her down the Middle River and\r\nfitted her out as a privateer. New sails were made, a few five-pounders\r\nwere placed on board; and with a crew of about twenty men she set sail,\r\nunder the command of Captain John O’Brien, in search of British prizes,\r\nof which he brought several into Machias.\r\n\r\nIt was late in September or early in October, 1776, that the\r\n“Margaretta,” re-named the “Machias Cruiser,” sailed from Machias, going\r\nwestward. When in the vicinity of Mt. Desert, O’Brien espied in the\r\noffing what he supposed was a British merchant vessel, going to the\r\neastward. Upon drawing nearer to the vessel, with a view to giving her\r\nbattle, O’Brien ascertained that she was a British warship. Crowding on\r\nall sail, he turned the prow of the “Machias Cruiser” away from the\r\nenemy, for which he well knew his vessel was no match. He hoped to be\r\nable to reach Machias Bay, and there find harbor and shelter. The\r\nBritish warship was gaining rapidly on the American vessel; sending a\r\nshot now and then after O’Brien, whose vessel, however, remained\r\nunharmed. When off Sawyer’s Cove, about forty miles to the eastward of\r\nMt. Desert, O’Brien, who saw that he would be overtaken by his fleet\r\npursuer, ran his vessel into the cove, beached her on the flats, and he\r\nand his men jumped into the shallow water and swam and waded ashore.\r\nThey found shelter in half a dozen dwelling houses in the vicinity. This\r\nwas the first and the last defeat Captain John O’Brien, in his long\r\ncareer, ever suffered.\r\n\r\nAs near as can now be ascertained, it was sometime during 1778 or early\r\nin 1779, that Captain John O’Brien removed to Newburyport,\r\nMassachusetts; and his brothers, Dennis and Joseph, soon after followed\r\nhim to the same village in Newbury township. In Newburyport, the three\r\nbrothers jointly engaged in mercantile and commercial pursuits.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September, 1779, Captain John O’Brien and Miss Hannah\r\nTappan, daughter of Richard Tappan, were united in marriage. They had\r\nfirst met during a previous visit of Captain O’Brien to Newburyport. It\r\nis said that Miss Tappan was at first attracted to Captain O’Brien\r\nbecause of what she had heard of his highly meritorious connection with\r\nthe capture of the “Margaretta”; in her eyes he was, therefore, a hero.\r\n\r\nIn Newburyport, Captain and Mrs. O’Brien moved in the best society of\r\nthe place; his reputation as a prominent character in connection with\r\nthe Revolution, and his upright, manly bearing, opening to him the\r\navenues of entrance to society. As a full-dressed gentleman of the\r\nperiod, he is said to have made a very fine appearance. One of Captain\r\nJohn O’Brien’s descendants, a grandson, thus speaks of his ancestor: “In\r\nthe olden times, when my grandfather was in his prime, his ships visited\r\nthe Indies, and the rich owners lived in stately mansions and made a\r\ngreat display of style in dress and manner. The gentlemen of fashion\r\nalmost outdid the ladies in the neatness of their attire. I have in my\r\npossession some articles of dress worn by my grandfather when he lived\r\nin Newbury; they answer to the description given by the historians of\r\nthe time of the brilliant appearance which a full-dressed gentleman must\r\nhave made in a social party. A long blue coat, with ample pockets and\r\nsilver buttons; a white satin vest, of capacious dimensions; velvet\r\nbreeches reaching to the knees and fastened there by silver buckles;\r\nsilk stockings and buckled shoes; ruffles in the bosom, and at the\r\nwrists, and a richly embroidered scarf around the neck—all this gorgeous\r\narray presents a striking contrast to the studied simplicity of a\r\ngentleman’s dress in our day. Later in life, my grandfather laid off\r\nsome of this finery; but he retained his ‘small clothes’ and knee\r\nbuckles and silk stockings to the last.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1780, Captain John O’Brien and his brother Joseph\r\nbuilt in Newburyport a vessel intended for the privateer service. She\r\nwas named the “Hannibal,” and was to carry twenty-four guns and have a\r\ncrew of one hundred and thirty men. On her first cruise, to Port au\r\nPrince, San Domingo, she was commanded by Captain John O’Brien; he\r\ncaptured several important British prizes.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of the “Hannibal,” while in command of Captain\r\nJeremiah O’Brien, by the British,[26] late in 1780 or early in 1781,\r\nCaptain John O’Brien and a few others built in Newburyport another\r\nvessel for the privateer service, which was named the “Hibernia.” She\r\nwas a small vessel, but a splendid sailer. The “Hibernia” carried six\r\nthree-pound guns. Of this vessel Captain John O’Brien took command\r\n(Captain Jeremiah O’Brien was then on board the prison ship Jersey, at\r\nWallabout Bay). Captain John O’Brien inflicted great damage upon British\r\nshipping with the “Hibernia.” On his first cruise, which lasted less\r\nthan four weeks, he captured three brigs, a ship and two schooners from\r\nthe enemy. During this cruise O’Brien met with a sixteen-gun British\r\nship of war, with which he engaged in a fight lasting nearly two hours.\r\nFrom this evidently unequal encounter he escaped with the loss of three\r\nkilled and several wounded. One of the wounded men on board the\r\n“Hibernia” had an arm shattered by a cannon-shot from the enemy. The\r\nsurgeon on board, instead of proceeding to amputate the arm, stood\r\ntrembling, afraid to undertake the operation. The wounded man was\r\nrapidly bleeding to death. Captain O’Brien drew his pistol, and,\r\npointing it at the surgeon, said: “Do your duty, sir, or I’ll blow your\r\nbrains out!” The arm was speedily amputated, and the man’s life was\r\nthereby saved.\r\n\r\nAs a result of a subsequent cruise in the “Hibernia,” Captain John\r\nO’Brien brought into Newburyport eleven British merchant vessels, all\r\nrichly laden, out of a fleet of twelve with which he had fallen in off\r\nthe mouth of the Narrows, below New York.\r\n\r\nCaptain O’Brien, while cruising in the vicinity of New York, espied a\r\nlarge vessel which he supposed was a British merchantman, and he at once\r\n“bore down” upon the craft. Upon ascertaining that the vessel was a\r\nBritish man-of-war, O’Brien immediately crowded on all sail, and,\r\nsuddenly altering the course of the “Hibernia,” ran from the enemy’s\r\nvessel. The British man-of-war pursued the “Hibernia,” and as the former\r\nwas the faster sailer, she was rapidly gaining on the American\r\nprivateer. It was then nearly dusk. As soon as darkness settled down\r\nupon the water, O’Brien ballasted a hogshead, set firmly in one side of\r\nit a pole, at the top of which he placed a large, lighted lantern.\r\nLowering the hogshead into the water, O’Brien ordered an anchor cast;\r\nthe fog, by this time being so dense that the “Hibernia” could not be\r\ndiscerned by the British man-of-war. The heavy muffled sound of booming\r\ncannon was soon heard on board the American privateer. It proved to be\r\nthe enemy furiously bombarding the floating hogshead, which had been\r\ntaken by the British commander for the “Hibernia.” At length silence\r\nreigned. When morning broke, the British man-of-war was nowhere to be\r\nseen; the commanding officer no doubt congratulating himself upon the\r\ndestruction of O’Brien’s vessel.\r\n\r\n“It has been said,” remarks a Machias friend of Captain O’Brien, “and is\r\ndoubtless in the main true, that the proceeds of the sales of the\r\nvessels and cargoes captured by Captain John O’Brien during the\r\nRevolution, contributed to the foundation of the fortunes of many of the\r\nresidents of Newburyport, into which they were brought.” Captain\r\nO’Brien, upon delivering the captured prizes at the wharves or out in\r\nthe harbor, would say: “Here, boys, you take care of these, and I’ll go\r\nout for more.” He evidently did not care so much for money as he did for\r\nthe opportunity of seeing the British flag come down.\r\n\r\n“He had a heart as big as an ox,” is the estimate of Captain O’Brien\r\ngiven by those well qualified to judge in the matter.\r\n\r\nOf the home of Captain John O’Brien, in Newburyport, a granddaughter\r\nsays, in some papers left by her at her decease:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Most of my childhood and youth was spent in the house of my maternal\r\n  grandfather. I loved my own home, my little flower bed, my dog, my\r\n  brothers; I reverenced my father almost to idolatry, and doted on my\r\n  sweet, indulgent mother, but I recollect no such expansion of feeling\r\n  as I always experienced at my grandfather’s. There was a life and a\r\n  movement in the family, a freedom just within the bounds of license,\r\n  and an overflowing joyfulness which suited my buoyant and eager\r\n  temper. His residence was in a large and pleasant seaport town in\r\n  Massachusetts; the dwelling, a handsome three-story house, stood on a\r\n  little eminence, withdrawn from the public road, and commanding from\r\n  the upper windows a delightful view of the town, the surrounding\r\n  country, and the distant sea.\r\n\r\n  “The house, in front, and at the ends appeared square, but on reaching\r\n  the rear it was perceived that the ends projected perhaps twenty feet\r\n  beyond the main body, leaving a deep recess which looked a little like\r\n  the interior court in eastern dwellings. This was a cool and shady\r\n  spot, the grass growing thick and green under foot, and all around the\r\n  three enclosed sides of the house, immense bushes of roses, white and\r\n  red, rich and fragrant enough for Paradise, climbed almost to the\r\n  chamber windows. Through the centre ran a narrow gravel-walk to a door\r\n  which opened opposite the large front entrance, and this arrangement\r\n  gave in summer a delightful draft, and made this little court one of\r\n  the pleasantest of retreats. A wooden platform, perhaps five feet\r\n  wide, ran the whole length of the rear, and here, in a sunny day, lay\r\n  old Bravo, that wondrous dog, who had gone through almost as many\r\n  adventures as his master, basking in the warm beams. Here, too, in a\r\n  warm afternoon, sat Uncle Joseph, that pleasantest of granduncles, in\r\n  his morning gown, with his pipe in his mouth, ready with his joke for\r\n  every passerby. I have good cause to remember him, for I was his pet\r\n  and plaything, and was teased and indulged for his amusement more than\r\n  was good for my temper.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the Revolution, Captain O’Brien continued for several\r\nyears to reside in Newburyport. In command of his own vessels he visited\r\nmany ports, American and foreign; including Philadelphia, the West\r\nIndies, Liverpool, London, France and Spain. During one of his visits in\r\nLondon, he purchased some long silk stockings, such as were worn by\r\ngentlemen at the time. On the voyage home he opened the package only to\r\ndiscover that he had paid for a lot of stocking legs, minus feet. Being\r\nin London a few months later, he made a second purchase of silk\r\nstockings in the same store where the first lot had been purchased. The\r\nEnglish merchant did not recognize his customer. The price asked by the\r\nmerchant was very low for the quality of stockings offered. Taking\r\nadvantage of the low price asked, Captain O’Brien made a large purchase,\r\nand laid the pay, in gold, on the counter. Upon seeing the merchant\r\nabout to take the stockings purchased, away, ostensibly to wrap them,\r\nCaptain O’Brien took the purchase from the counter, remarking, as he did\r\nso: “Don’t trouble yourself, I’ll take them as they are”; and, to the\r\ngreat disgust of the tricky Englishman, O’Brien at once left the store\r\nwith his purchase. The London merchant was outwitted by the Yankee\r\ncustomer; for he intended to repeat the dishonesty of the first\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nCaptain John O’Brien was once challenged by a Frenchman to fight a duel;\r\nthe Frenchman having for some reason taken offense. The challenge was\r\naccepted, and as the challenged party, Captain O’Brien chose as his\r\nweapon, a cannon; and in accordance with the rules of duelling, he was\r\nto have the first shot. Upon being informed of the weapon chosen by the\r\nvisiting Yankee, the Frenchman, hitherto so brave, was terrified, and\r\nwithdrew his challenge.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of his cargo in a foreign port into which he had sailed,\r\nCaptain O’Brien went on board his vessel with the proceeds of the sale,\r\nwhich was in gold. This he had placed in his capacious satin vest\r\npocket. During his absence on shore the crew of his vessel had formed a\r\nplot to kill him when he came on board, and take from him, and divide\r\namong themselves, the large amount of money they knew he would have\r\nabout his person. Captain O’Brien had no sooner stepped upon the deck of\r\nhis vessel than one of the crew, chosen for the work, struck him on the\r\nhead with a mauling spike. He fell, stunned, upon the deck. After taking\r\nfrom his vest pockets the gold, several of the mutinous crew threw the\r\nunconscious officer overboard. As he struck the water (this he\r\nsubsequently related), he partially recovered consciousness; but down,\r\ndown, down he went, until his feet touched bottom, when he gave an\r\nenergetic spring upward, and soon reached the surface. Having fully\r\nrecovered consciousness, he swam for his vessel, which was but a short\r\ndistance away. While Captain O’Brien was in the water the crew had\r\nattempted to kill his brother, William, the first mate; but he had\r\nescaped from his would-be murderers by seeking shelter behind one of the\r\nbig guns on board. Unseen by the crew, Captain O’Brien reached the deck\r\nof his vessel, and immediately seizing a mauling spike, he rushed into\r\nthe midst of the mutineers, swinging the heavy instrument to the right\r\nand left with tremendous vigor. Supposing Captain O’Brien to be an\r\napparition, as they took it for granted he had been drowned, the\r\nmutineers became so thoroughly affrighted that they tumbled almost\r\nheadlong down the hatchway, hastily closing it after them. Captain\r\nO’Brien, with the assistance of the first mate, at once securely\r\nfastened the hatchway. He then went on shore and notified the civil\r\nauthorities of the mutiny of the crew, and of their attempt upon his\r\nlife, and that of his brother, William. The mutineers, twenty-five in\r\nnumber, were arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to death. Through\r\nthe intercession of Captain O’Brien, however, the sentence of death was\r\nchanged to banishment to a desert island. “My grandfather, though so\r\nbold, was also tenderhearted,” said one of his descendants, “and could\r\nnot bear to have so many lives taken, especially as some of the crew\r\nhad, he believed, been dragged into the mutiny; so he interceded for\r\nthem with the government, and obtained a commutation of the penalty.”\r\n\r\n“One day while in Madrid,” I now quote the words of a descendant, “he\r\n(Captain O’Brien) visited a friend at his house; and when leaving,\r\ntoward evening, to return to the ship (the harbor was several miles from\r\nthe city), he was presented with a stout cane, an Irish shilelah, with\r\nthe remark that he might find it useful sometime for self-defense. My\r\ngrandfather accepted the cane, and, thanking his friend, went out to\r\nhire a hack which should take him to the port. He passed along a row of\r\ncarriages, but no driver was willing to go out of the city at so late an\r\nhour, till he reached the very last man of all. When asked whether he\r\nwould go, he glanced at the sun, now almost down, and intimated that he\r\nwould. He was a suspicious looking fellow, whom one would not care to\r\nmeet in a lonely place, but there was no choice. So he mounted the\r\ncarriage and was driven off. My grandfather was said to have never known\r\nfear, and his courage stood him in good stead now. There was a partition\r\nbetween the two men. When they were well out of the city, in the open\r\ncountry, my grandfather observed the driver making a movement as if to\r\nget nearer to him. Watching his chance, just as the fellow raised his\r\nbody, my grandfather planted his feet against the driver and pushed him\r\noff the seat on to the ground. Then instantly jumping out, Captain\r\nO’Brien stood directly over the prostrate and astonished driver, with\r\nhis stout cudgel in his hand, and exclaimed: ‘Now, get on that seat, and\r\ndrive me as I tell you, or I’ll knock your brains out!’ The wretch taken\r\nby surprise, and perceiving that he had fallen into formidable hands,\r\ndared not disobey. As the driver sprang to his seat, my grandfather\r\ninstantly followed him, holding over him his shilelah, ready to execute\r\nhis threat. When they reached the port, the sun was set. My grandfather\r\njumped off the carriage, threw some money upon the ground and went\r\naboard his ship.\r\n\r\n“Some years after, he chanced to meet his friend, who expressed great\r\nsurprise at seeing him. ‘What, are you alive, Captain! When I learned\r\nthat you had left the city with that villain of a driver, I never\r\nexpected to see you again. It is notorious that he has killed many\r\npersons under similar circumstances.’\r\n\r\n“‘Thanks for your shilelah,’ said my grandfather, ‘which through a kind\r\nProvidence saved me from death. I shall always cherish it as a memento\r\nof my friend, and for the good service it did me.’”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1820, Captain John O’Brien removed to Brunswick, Maine,\r\nwhere he had purchased about twenty acres of land. Upon a portion of\r\nthis land he built a house, said to have been the finest in the place.\r\nHere, Captain O’Brien resolved to spend the remainder of his days in\r\nwell-earned rest from a long, arduous and highly eventful public\r\ncareer.[27]\r\n\r\nAnother grandson of Captain O’Brien thus speaks of the latter’s home in\r\nBrunswick: “Without the slightest exaggeration I can say, that my\r\ngrandfather’s place was a ‘glowing rose-garden of rapture,’ a paradise;\r\nand when its pearly gates now and then opened to let me in for a few\r\ndays’ visit, I was perfectly happy. When the time came to leave, though\r\nI had a good home to go to, it was, I imagine, with some such feelings\r\nas Adam had when he turned his back upon Eden, only that I had this\r\nadvantage over my unhappy progenitor, that I was not forbidden to return\r\nsome happy day. What a halo about that spot, to my youthful imagination!\r\nThere was no place like it in the world; how pleasant it lies in my\r\nmemory, with a brightness that has never faded.”\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in Brunswick, Captain O’Brien used occasionally to\r\nvisit Machias, where his parents, and two brothers, Colonel Jeremiah,\r\nand Gideon, resided. On one of the visits to Machias a daughter\r\naccompanied him. As they were passing through a piece of dense, dark\r\nwoods, many miles from a human habitation, a man climbed into the rear\r\nof the vehicle, for the purpose, evidently, of robbing Captain O’Brien.\r\nDoubtless the would-be robber thought an aged man, such as his\r\nprospective victim seemed to be, would be an easy case to deal with;\r\nbut, as he soon ascertained, appearances are often deceiving. Placing\r\nthe reins in the hands of his daughter, and instructing her to drive the\r\nhorse at a rapid speed, he stood up in the vehicle, and, reaching round\r\nto the rear, he laid the whip on to the intruder with such great vigor\r\nthat he jumped to the ground, and was soon left far behind.\r\n\r\nWhile a resident of Brunswick, Captain O’Brien, through the intercession\r\nof Mr. Joseph Wheaton, a former Machias acquaintance, who then held a\r\nposition under the Government, at Washington, was appointed postmaster.\r\n\r\nMr. Wheaton, who it should be said, took part in the capture of the\r\n“Margaretta,” thus writes Captain O’Brien, from Washington, with regard\r\nto his appointment, as postmaster, at Brunswick; the letter was written\r\nin 1823:\r\n\r\n“I represented to him (Mr. Harris, of the House of Representatives) your\r\nardent zeal for the country in your youth, your manly conduct in the\r\naffair you touched upon, relating to the Margaretta schooner and called\r\nto his recollection that in that action we became pirates, traitors and\r\nrebels, according to the laws of England at that time; that our success\r\n(established) the necessity of manly resistance everywhere or the\r\nconsequences would have been more distressing than death—it would have\r\nbeen universal slavery to all the people; that Captain Moore was the\r\nfirst naval officer that fell in the Revolution; that your services had\r\nbeen uniform and of the highest manly character, and that you were now\r\nadvanced in years and it would be most grateful to your feelings to\r\nreceive some token that you were not refused a small favor.”[28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. JAMES M. GRAHAM.\r\n\r\n  Of Springfield, Ill.\r\n\r\n  Member of Congress from his state and an earnest member of the\r\n    Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA grandson of the subject of this sketch thus describes the character of\r\nhis grandfather: “... my maternal grandfather developed a character in\r\nwhich energy and decision were prominent qualities. It was said of him\r\nlater in life, that he never knew what fear was; but though possessed of\r\na strong will and prompt to exact obedience when in command, he had a\r\ncalm and reasonable temper and a gentlemanly bearing which gained for\r\nhim the respect and confidence of the community. He was not a man to\r\ntrifle with, neither was he a man to stand in dread of. He was just and\r\nhonorable in his treatment of others, and gentle to the young and\r\nhelpless.”\r\n\r\nA most touching story is related concerning the burial of Mrs. John\r\nO’Brien, with whom the captain had lived happily for nearly fifty years.\r\nOn the day of the funeral, held at his home, he was seen standing at the\r\nfoot of the flight of stairs, leading from their bedroom down into the\r\nfront hallway, as if he was waiting for some one to come down. For\r\nseveral years it had been his custom, on Sunday morning, to thus stand,\r\nand wait for Mrs. O’Brien to come down, to accompany him to the house of\r\nworship in the village. For a moment, on the occasion above referred to,\r\nhe seemed to have forgotten that his wife was to be buried, and he was\r\nwatching for her to come down stairs to go with him, as usual, to the\r\nvillage church. When he awoke to the fact that his beloved wife was that\r\nday to be buried, he was well nigh overcome with grief. This was in\r\n1826.\r\n\r\nAbout six years later, on the 8th of May, 1832, Captain John O’Brien\r\ndied. He was then 82 years of age. He was buried in Brunswick, where his\r\nremains now rest.\r\n\r\nAll honor to his memory!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe writer of this sketch wishes hereby to gratefully acknowledge his\r\nindebtedness to Heman W.

Carr, Esq., of\r\nthe Wilmington, N. C., bar, appears a comprehensive sketch of the\r\nDickson family, and “An act to erect and establish an academy in the\r\nCounty of Duplin,” the text of the act being as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whereas, the establishing an academy in the said County for the\r\n  education of Youth, will be attended with great advantages to the\r\n  State in general and the County of Duplin in particular:\r\n\r\n  1. Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly of North Carolina,\r\n  and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, that Thomas\r\n  Routledge, James Kenan, Joseph Dickson, Thomas Gray, William Dickson,\r\n  David Dodd, John James, Israel Bordeaux and James Gillespie, Esquires,\r\n  be and they are hereby constituted and appointed trustees with full\r\n  power and authority to receive into their hands and possession all\r\n  monies and other property which have been or hereafter may be\r\n  subscribed for the purpose of erecting an academy on the lands lately\r\n  purchased of Nicholas Hunter in said County, by name of Grove Academy;\r\n  and the said trustees and their successors shall be able and capable\r\n  in law to ask for and demand, receive and possess of the several\r\n  subscribers all sums by them respectively subscribed, and in case of\r\n  refusal of any of them to pay the same, to sue for and recover by\r\n  action of debt or otherwise, in the name of the trustees, the sum\r\n  which such person so refusing shall have subscribed, in any\r\n  jurisdiction having cognizance thereof; and the monies when collected\r\n  and received, to be applied by the said trustees or a majority of them\r\n  towards paying for the lands already contracted for, and erecting\r\n  thereon a suitable and convenient house, to contract with and employ a\r\n  tutor or tutors, and to perform every act or thing that they or a\r\n  majority of them shall think necessary and expedient for the\r\n  advancement of the said academy and the promotion of learning therein.\r\n\r\n  2. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the\r\n  trustees hereinbefore mentioned, shall, previous to their entering on\r\n  the execution of the trust reposed by this Act, give bond to the court\r\n  of the County, payable to the Chairman and his successor, in the sum\r\n  of One Thousand Pounds specie, with condition that they shall well and\r\n  faithfully account for and apply all gifts, donations, bequests and\r\n  monies which they may receive of and by virtue of this act for the\r\n  purposes aforesaid.\r\n\r\n  3. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any\r\n  of the trustees by this Act appointed shall die, refuse to act or\r\n  remove away that he cannot attend the duties of his appointment, the\r\n  remaining trustees may appoint another in his stead, who shall\r\n  exercise the same powers as trustees appointed by this Act: and when\r\n  met together within the said County shall have power and authority to\r\n  elect and constitute one or more tutor or tutors, and a treasurer, and\r\n  also to make and ordain such rules and regulations, not repugnant to\r\n  the laws of this State, for the well ordering of the students, their\r\n  morals, studies and academical exercises, as to them shall seem meet;\r\n  and to give certificates to such students as shall leave said academy,\r\n  certifying their literary merit; in general they shall or may do all\r\n  such things as are usually done by bodies corporate and politic, or\r\n  such as may be necessary for the promotion of learning and virtue; and\r\n  the said trustees, or a majority of them are hereby empowered, and\r\n  shall have lawful authority to remove the tutor or tutors, treasurer\r\n  or any of them if they shall find it necessary, and on the death,\r\n  resignation or refusal to act of any of them, to appoint and elect\r\n  others in the stead of those displaced, dead or refusing to act.\r\n\r\n  4. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the\r\n  trustees by this Act appointed, or a majority of them, and their\r\n  successors, shall meet annually on the first Friday of March in each\r\n  and every year, or at any other time they may find more convenient,\r\n  and elect a proper person out of their own body to preside for the\r\n  term of one year, who may convene the trustees at any time he may find\r\n  it necessary. Provided always that he shall give ten days previous\r\n  notice of such meeting and that the President and Treasurer shall be\r\n  chosen on the said first Friday of March unless in cases of\r\n  unavoidable accidents.\r\n\r\n  5. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the\r\n  treasurer of the said Board of Trustees shall enter into bond with\r\n  sufficient security to the trustees, conditioned for the faithful\r\n  discharge of the trust reposed in him by this Act, and that all monies\r\n  and chattels that shall be in his hands, at the expiration of his\r\n  office, shall be immediately paid into the hands of the succeeding\r\n  treasurer; and every treasurer shall receive all monies, donations,\r\n  gifts, bequests and charities that may belong or accrue to said\r\n  Academy during his office, and at the expiration thereof shall account\r\n  with the trustees or a majority of them for the same, and on refusal\r\n  or neglect to pay and deliver as aforesaid, the same mode of\r\n  recovering may be had against him as is or may be provided for the\r\n  recovery of money from sheriffs or other public officers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his sketch of the Dickson Family the author says: Simon Dickson was\r\nborn in England about the year 1607, or 1608. He was a stern English\r\nPuritan, an ardent adherent of Oliver Cromwell, and served faithfully as\r\nan officer in the Parliamentary army during that fierce struggle between\r\nParliament and the King; his official rank, however, is unknown to us.\r\nAfter the Revolution was over, as a reward for his services, he received\r\na grant of four hundred acres of valuable land within two miles of\r\nDromore, in the county of Down, Ireland. Here he settled and had a\r\nnumerous offspring, but the exact number of his children is unknown. At\r\nthe restoration of Charles II, the land grants of the Cromwellian\r\nadministration were annulled, and Simon Dickson became a tenant on the\r\nsame land he had previously owned.\r\n\r\n“Simon Dickson was the father of Joseph the first, who was the father of\r\nJoseph the second, who was the father of Michael, who was the father of\r\nJohn.” Joseph the second lived to be ninety-four years old, and Michael\r\npassed his eighty-fourth year.\r\n\r\nJohn Dickson was born in Ireland about the year 1704 and died in Duplin\r\nCounty, North Carolina, on the 25th day of December, 1774, just at the\r\nbeginning of the American Revolution. He emigrated from Ireland to the\r\nState of Pennsylvania in the year 1738 and settled in Chester County,\r\nwhere he resided several years and had two sons born to him, Michael and\r\nWilliam. He then moved to Maryland, where he remained only a short\r\nwhile, and leaving there he came to Duplin County between 1740 and 1745.\r\nUpon his death in Duplin, in 1774, he left surviving him seven sons and\r\none daughter, whose names are given in order of their age, as follows:\r\nMichael, William, Robert, Joseph, Alexander, Edward, James and Mary.\r\n\r\nMichael Dickson moved to Georgia just before or after the Revolution,\r\nwhere it is said he has many descendants, though no definite information\r\nabout them can be obtained.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dickson, the second son of John Dickson, and the writer of the\r\nDickson Letters, was born in Pennsylvania about the year 1740, and came\r\nto Duplin County with his father when quite a small boy. Upon arriving\r\nat manhood he took an active part in public affairs and during\r\nRevolutionary times he was the foremost man in his county as a leader in\r\ncivil affairs, while his compatriot, Colonel James Kenan, was at the\r\nhead of all military operations. It is probable, almost certain, that he\r\nentered the army as a regular militiaman under Colonel Kenan, and served\r\nthrough the entire war. His educational advantages were very limited,\r\nand a family tradition tells us that his school days were comprised\r\nwithin a space of three months. Notwithstanding this, he was a man of\r\nbroad ideas, mature judgment, and profound wisdom; and he discussed\r\npolitical affairs with an intuitive knowledge and foresight that were\r\nremarkable. His comments on the American form of government (then an\r\nuntried theory) in his letter of 1790, his reasons why North Carolina\r\nadopted the federal constitution, his prediction that “the southern\r\nstates will not receive equal benefit in the government with the\r\nnorthern states” and that the North would eventually demand the\r\nemancipation of slavery (and this written seventy years before the Civil\r\nWar)—all these are ideas worthy of a statesman and found conception in\r\nno ordinary mind.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of wonderful native ability; but was modest to a fault, and\r\nseldom in his letters to his cousin in Ireland does he even refer to the\r\nservices he rendered in the Revolution. Tradition has it that he was for\r\nforty-four successive years clerk of the court in Duplin County; but the\r\nwriter has not examined the records for a verification of this tradition\r\nfurther than to find that he served in this capacity for quite a long\r\ntime. He was a delegate to the first provincial congress, held at\r\nNewbern on the 25th of August, 1774; to the second provincial congress,\r\nheld at Halifax on the 3rd of April, 1775; to the third provincial\r\ncongress, held at Hillsboro on the 21st day of August, 1775; and to the\r\nfourth provincial congress, held at Halifax on the 12th of November,\r\n1776, which framed North Carolina’s first constitution. He also\r\nrepresented Duplin in the House of Commons in 1795. It is told of him\r\nthat when Cornwallis’ army marched through the county on its way from\r\nWilmington to Virginia he concealed the records of the county in an iron\r\npot in Goshen Swamp to prevent their destruction by the British. He died\r\nin 1820, an honored and highly respected citizen.\r\n\r\nRobert Dickson, the third son of John Dickson, moved to Virginia at the\r\nclose of the Revolution, but returned to Duplin about 1784, where he\r\nmade his permanent home. He has many descendants in North Carolina,\r\nchiefly in Cumberland County. He was a justice of the peace for Duplin\r\nfor a number of years, and served as a member of the House of Commons in\r\n1777, 1784, 1785, 1786, 1787 and 1788.\r\n\r\nJoseph Dickson, the fourth son of John Dickson, emigrated west about the\r\nclose of the Revolution; but, being dissatisfied, soon returned to his\r\nnative county, where he reared a large family consisting of one\r\ndaughter, Anne, and eight sons. He served in the capacity of Register of\r\nDeeds and also as county surveyor of Duplin, and represented his county\r\nin the House of Commons in 1780 and 1797. Anne Dickson, his oldest child\r\nand only daughter, married James Pearsall, many of the descendants of\r\nwhom now reside in Duplin and adjoining counties. Later in life Joseph\r\ntook his entire family of eight grown sons, together with other Dickson\r\nrelatives, and moved to Tennessee in quest of large landed estates, a\r\ndesire for which had become common in the family. Dickson County,\r\nTennessee, takes its name from a member of the Duplin family.\r\n\r\nAlexander Dickson, the fifth son of John Dickson, following the dreams\r\nof his brothers, and searching for fortunes elsewhere, emigrated to\r\nVirginia about 1781, and afterwards to Maryland; but returned in 1784\r\nand took up his permanent abode in Duplin, where he accumulated\r\nconsiderable wealth. He died leaving no family, and bequeathed his\r\nproperty, as an educational fund, to the poor children of his county.\r\nThis fund has commonly been known as the “Dickson Charity Fund”; but,\r\nthrough years of mismanagement and ill-directed investments, it has\r\nalmost come to naught, and like most bequests of this kind has not\r\nserved the high purpose for which it was intended.\r\n\r\nEdward Dickson, the sixth son of John Dickson, had no ambition for\r\npolitical honors, but was one of the foremost and most prosperous\r\ncitizens of Duplin. He married and reared a family in Duplin, and there\r\nwas no man more highly esteemed and respected. His oldest daughter,\r\nRebecca, married Rev. Jacob Williams, by whom she had a daughter, Ann,\r\nwho married Dr. Stephen Graham, a noted physician of Duplin County in\r\nhis day. Sarah Rebecca Graham, daughter of Dr. Stephen Graham and Ann\r\nGraham, and sister of the late Stephen Graham of Kenansville, married\r\nOwen R. Kenan, and, as a result of this union, left the following\r\nchildren: Thomas S. Kenan, of Raleigh; William R. Kenan, of Wilmington;\r\nJames G. Kenan, and Annie Dickson Kenan, of Kenansville.\r\n\r\nJames Dickson, the youngest son of John Dickson, spent his entire life\r\nin Duplin County. He married twice and had fifteen children, eight boys\r\nand seven girls. We are told that as a reward for military services he\r\nreceived large grants of land in Tennessee from the United States\r\nGovernment; but we have no information as to what services he performed,\r\nand William Dickson in one of his letters says none of the brothers\r\nexcept himself actually took up arms and joined the army. He may have\r\nrendered some services in the war of 1812, but we have no direct\r\ninformation on this point. However, James Dickson owned large estates in\r\nTennessee and his three oldest sons, Edward, William and Alexander,\r\nemigrated there in the early part of this century and took possession of\r\nthem. Robert Dickson, the youngest son of James, married Mary Catherine\r\nSloan, and was the grandfather of the writer.\r\n\r\nMary Dickson, the only daughter and youngest child of John Dickson,\r\nmarried William McGowan at the age of eighteen, and she has many\r\ndescendants in this and other states. She was the great grandmother of\r\nBenjamin F. Hall of Wilmington.\r\n\r\nThe first three letters, which are made a part of the publication, and\r\nthe fourth, which is an extract taken from an old copy of the\r\n_Fayetteville Examiner_, were written by William Dickson to his cousin,\r\nRev. Robert Dickson, a Presbyterian clergyman, at Narrow Water, near\r\nNewry, Ireland; and are printed for their historical and literary value.\r\nThe fifth letter was written by William Dickson to Linda Dickson, his\r\nniece, who was at the time visiting her older sister, Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nJohnson, of Charleston, S. C., and is printed to show the character of\r\nthe writer in his domestic relations.\r\n\r\nThe originals of the first three letters are still in existence and bear\r\non them the marks of having served their mission as a messenger of good\r\nnews to a far-away cousin. Years after they were written, two young men,\r\nthe sons of Rev. Robert Dickson, we think, came to this country, and in\r\norder to identify themselves brought the original letters with them. One\r\nof the young men was drowned, the other returned to Ireland, and the\r\nletters fell into the hands of John Dickson, of Cumberland County; and\r\nthe family of the late Robert K. Bryan, Sr., of Scott’s Hill, N. C., and\r\nthe Evans family of Cumberland County, who are descendants of the\r\nDicksons, have carefully preserved them.\r\n\r\nThe fourth letter, or rather extract, is taken from an old copy of the\r\n_Fayetteville Examiner_, and the original cannot be produced, but there\r\nis conclusive evidence that it is genuine.\r\n\r\nJohn Dickson, the father of William Dickson, had a brother by the name\r\nof William Dickson, who moved from Pennsylvania and settled in the\r\nWestern part of the State, where he died on the first day of January,\r\n1775. We have no record of his family, but it is reasonable to suppose\r\nthat he was the father of General Joseph Dickson, of Lincoln County, who\r\nrendered valuable service in the Revolution, and was Congressman about\r\n1800.\r\n\r\nIn editing these letters the writer has preserved intact the wording and\r\nphraseology of the original manuscript, but has made some slight changes\r\nin regard to capitalization, spelling and punctuation, and this has been\r\ndone only for the purpose of making them conform to our modern usage in\r\nthis respect, and where the change would in no way impair the sense or\r\nexpression of the originals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL JAMES SHIELDS, HERO OF THE MEXICAN AND CIVIL WARS AND UNITED\r\n STATES SENATOR FROM THREE STATES.—THE FRENCH-IRISH BRIGADES IN THE WAR\r\n  OF INDEPENDENCE.—BISHOP BERKELEY AND HIS PLANS FOR A GREAT AMERICAN\r\n                              UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n            BY HON. WILLIAM J. ONAHAN OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\n    [Three very interesting articles on widely differing historical\r\n                               subjects.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL JAMES SHIELDS, HERO OF THE MEXICAN AND THE CIVIL WARS; U. S.\r\n                       SENATOR FROM THREE STATES.\r\n\r\nIn the Statuary Hall of the National Capitol, Washington, may be seen\r\nstatues of the distinguished men of the different states of the Union,\r\nplaced there under authority of a resolution or act of Congress, which\r\nprovided that each state could place there two figures of its choice.\r\n\r\nThe State of Illinois, by an act of the General Assembly, determined\r\nthat the statue of General James Shields should be one of those selected\r\nto represent Illinois. An appropriation was accordingly made for the\r\nstatue of the soldier statesman, and it now stands in the “Hall of Fame”\r\nat the Capitol, where it was formally installed with befitting and\r\nnotable public ceremonies.\r\n\r\nCertainly, by this act the State of Illinois gave to the nation and to\r\nthe world unequivocal testimony of the respect and esteem in which the\r\nsoldier statesman is held by the people of the state where he first won\r\nrecognition, and which he served in so many and so various public\r\ncapacities with fidelity and renown.\r\n\r\nA most interesting and unique figure in the history of Illinois is that\r\npresented by the career and character of James Shields. Member of the\r\nstate legislature in early days, he became subsequently auditor, judge\r\nof the Supreme Court, general in command of a brigade of Illinois\r\nvolunteers in the war with Mexico, and finally United States senator.\r\nThese various offices and distinctions came to him from Illinois; and\r\nthese, it might reasonably be supposed, would have sufficed to crown and\r\ncomplete the public career of a man so favored by political fortune. But\r\nthis was not the end.\r\n\r\nFailing of re-election to the United States Senate at the expiration of\r\nhis term, because of changed political conditions, Shields removed to\r\nMinnesota, then a territory, and on its subsequent admission as a state\r\nhe was elected one of the senators, the other being Henry M. Rice.\r\nHaving drawn lots for the respective terms, Shields drew the short term,\r\nwhich terminated in 1860, and, having again failed of re-election from\r\nthe same cause that defeated him in Illinois—the growing ascendency of\r\nthe Republican party—he once more removed to another and more distant\r\nstate, California, where he was settled at the outbreak of the Civil\r\nWar. His sympathies and his military experience led him to offer his\r\nservices to President Lincoln, who promptly commissioned Shields as\r\nbrigadier general, and he was assigned to service in General Banks’\r\ncorps, then operating in West Virginia.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile in detached command he won the celebrated victory over the\r\nhitherto invincible Stonewall Jackson. Shortly after this he was\r\nnominated by the President as major general, but the Senate refused to\r\nconfirm the nomination, being influenced partly, no doubt, by political\r\nconsiderations—Democrats were not at the time in great favor—and partly,\r\nalso, no doubt, from misrepresentations regarding General Shields’\r\nconduct in relation to a defeat suffered by a portion of his command at\r\nPort Republic. This defeat, as was demonstrated later, was due to the\r\ndisregard of Shields’ orders; at all events, the hostile action of the\r\nSenate caused his withdrawal from the army. He resigned his commission\r\nand returned to California.\r\n\r\nShortly again his restless spirit stirred him to another change, and\r\nthis time he sought a home in Missouri, acquiring a farm near Carrollton\r\nin that state. Here in 1877 political fortune once more opened to him\r\nthe doors of the United States Senate. He was elected to fill an\r\nunexpired term, so that he now had the unique distinction of having been\r\nchosen to represent three different states of the Union—at, of course,\r\ndifferent periods of time. This fact, unexampled, I believe, in his\r\nhistory of the Senate, excited wondering comment at the time, and may\r\njustify an inquiry into the circumstances and character of the man who\r\nwas able to win for himself this remarkable degree of public favor from\r\nso many different states.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBorn in the County Tyrone, Ireland, in 1806, James Shields came of a\r\nfighting stock. His progenitors had fought at the Boyne and Aughrim for\r\nthe Stuart king and several had followed Sarsfield after the surrender\r\nof Limerick, to serve under the banners of King Louis on the continent.\r\nSo it was that young Shields inherited the warlike tastes and the\r\n“rebel” sympathies common to his countrymen. The story of his boyhood\r\nshows that he early manifested a taste for military pursuits. He was the\r\ndrill-master of his boyish companions at school, and headed them in many\r\njuvenile skirmishes and exploits.\r\n\r\nHe never gained the opportunity and advantages of a college or\r\nuniversity education, but he made up for this by the industrious and\r\npersevering use of his opportunities in later life, so that he came to\r\nbe recognized as an excellent classical scholar and even linguist.\r\n\r\nHis youthful attention was early drawn toward America—as indeed, is the\r\ncase with nearly all Irish boys. In the instance of young Shields he was\r\nspurred to emigrate by the counsels of an uncle who had seen service in\r\nthe revolutionary war, and who had written to the mother telling her\r\nthat if James did not leave the country he would surely be shot or hung\r\nas a rebel! In 1823, when 17 years of age, James Shields set out for\r\nAmerica. He first landed at Quebec. The uncle who had counseled his\r\nleaving Ireland and from whom he naturally expected aid and counsel, was\r\ndead, and he was thus left to his own scanty resources. He made his way\r\nto the States, and pushed westward to Illinois, until he reached\r\nKaskaskia, then the capital of the state, and it was there he commenced\r\nhis career, first as a school teacher, employing his leisure hours in\r\nreading law. That he made good use of his time, and had the knack of\r\nmaking friends, may be judged by his early election as a member of the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nShields had been admitted to the bar in 1832 and was elected to the\r\nlegislature in 1836. In 1841 he was elected auditor and in 1843 he was\r\nelected judge of the Supreme Court of Illinois—pretty rapid promotion\r\nfor the young Irishman.\r\n\r\nHe quickly entered the arena of national renown. President Polk in 1845\r\nappointed Shields commissioner of the general land office in Washington,\r\nand when the war with Mexico was declared Shields offered his services\r\nand was appointed brigadier general of volunteers—this in 1846. His\r\nmilitary career in the campaign in Mexico I scarcely need recall. It is\r\nto be found in the history of that war and in the official reports of\r\nthe chiefs of the army. His dash and bravery as well as his signal\r\nmilitary capacity were shown in every engagement from Cerro Gordo to\r\nChapultepec and the City of Mexico.\r\n\r\nHe was reported by General Scott in dispatches as fatally wounded at\r\nCerro Gordo, a ball having passed “clean through” his body. Happily the\r\nskill and dexterity of a Mexican surgeon—a prisoner—saved him. Some\r\naccounts say this surgeon was an Irishman who had seen service in the\r\nFrench army. This brings to mind an incident in the general’s later\r\nlife. During a visit to Chicago on a lecturing tour I introduced the\r\ngeneral to some of the “sights,” among other places to the board of\r\ntrade, of which I was then a member. When the fact became whispered\r\nabout that General Shields was on the floor the “pits” were quickly\r\ndeserted, the operators evidently being eager to testify their respect\r\nor gratify their curiosity. As he stood acknowledging the salutations of\r\nthe throng around him, a member of the board shook hands with him,\r\nsaying: “General, do you remember me?” The general evidently did not and\r\nsaid so.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you remember the soldier who tore off a piece of his shirt to\r\nstanch the blood from your wound when you lay on the field of Cerro\r\nGordo?”\r\n\r\nSure enough, it was the very man! He, too, was a veteran of the Mexican\r\nwar. I regret that I cannot now recall his name, which I heard at the\r\ntime. Of course, there was a cordial reception and hand-shake between\r\nthe two old soldiers.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Mexico at the close of the war, Shields was brevetted\r\nmajor general, and was nominated by the president governor of the\r\nterritory of Oregon. This appointment Shields declined. In 1849 he was\r\nelected United States senator from Illinois, as associate to Senator\r\nStephen A. Douglas.\r\n\r\nThere was a question raised in the Senate as to the regularity of\r\nShields’ election. My impression is—I have not the data before me as I\r\nwrite—that the irregularity was on the issue of citizenship; at all\r\nevents, the legislature cured the defect by electing Shields over again.\r\n\r\nAccording to the record, it was Shields who reported the bill making a\r\ngrant of lands to aid in the construction of the Illinois Central\r\nRailroad, the credit of which is usually given to Senator Douglas who\r\nwas no doubt also a warm champion of the measure. It was Shields who\r\nlikewise introduced and pressed the passage of a bill granting “bounty\r\nlands” to the soldiers and sailors who had served in the war with\r\nMexico. When England was threatening with her naval forces the little\r\nrepublic of San Salvador on some pretext, Senator Shields promptly\r\nintroduced a resolution on the subject, invoking the authority of the\r\nMonroe doctrine.\r\n\r\nBills to aid other railroad projects in Illinois were favorably reported\r\nby him. At that time the West was clamoring for railroads, which were\r\nindispensable to its development. In these days the country seems to\r\nforget how much of its progress and prosperity has been due to the much\r\nmaligned railroads. Space will not admit of even a summary of the\r\nimportant public measures that Shields had part in framing. The files of\r\nthe Congressional Record bear testimony to his unceasing industry during\r\nhis senatorial career. It is worthy of note that Shields was\r\nconsistently opposed to the extension of slavery and his record shows\r\nit, although in this regard he was not always in harmony with his party.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe State of Illinois, by vote of the legislature, presented to General\r\nShields a costly sword in recognition of his gallant services on the\r\nbattlefields of Mexico. The State of South Carolina in like manner voted\r\nhim a sword, “in testimony of her admiration of his gallantry in the\r\nMexican war, and as a tribute of gratitude for his parental attention to\r\nthe Palmetto regiment.” This regiment was in Shields’ brigade in several\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of his term in the Senate he failed to secure a\r\nre-election, Lyman Trumbull being chosen to succeed him. This result was\r\ndue to dissensions in the party ranks in consequence of the slavery\r\nissue, and to the growing power of the incipient Republican party.\r\n\r\nShortly after this Shields removed to Minnesota, gathering about his new\r\nhome the nucleus of an Irish colony which has since become the populous\r\nand prosperous settlement known as “Shieldsville.” In fact, this was the\r\nbeginning of the colonization movement in that state to which Archbishop\r\nIreland afterward lent his powerful aid.\r\n\r\nIt was during Shields’ sojourn in Minnesota that the overture was made\r\nto him to take the command of the papal army. This was at the time when\r\nthe revolutionary movement in Italy threatened the invasion and\r\nintegrity of the papal states during the reign of Pius IX. Shields\r\ndeclined to accept. I had the details of the overture from the general’s\r\nown lips at a late period of his life.\r\n\r\nWhen Minnesota was admitted as a state in 1858 Shields was chosen one of\r\nthe two senators, his colleague being Henry M. Rice. Lots being drawn to\r\ndetermine the respective terms, the short one—two years—fell to Shields.\r\nAt the end, as in Illinois, and from like cause, he failed of\r\nre-election, and soon he was again on the wing—this time for California.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe general opened a law office in San Francisco, and it was there he\r\nmarried. Soon the tumult and agitation of the secession movement,\r\nfollowed by the call for volunteers, stirred his patriotic spirit and\r\nmartial ardor. He offered his services to President Lincoln, who\r\ncommissioned him as brigadier general, assigned to General Banks’ corps\r\nin the army of West Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe veteran was quickly in the field of operations, soon at the head of\r\na division. It was while in this command he encountered the renowned\r\nStonewall Jackson, inflicting on this hitherto invincible confederate\r\ngeneral a defeat which sent him “whirling up the valley.” The tidings of\r\nthis remarkable victory caused great rejoicing throughout the North and\r\ngained great applause and commendations for General Shields. The army of\r\nVirginia up to this time had suffered a succession of disasters. The\r\ngovernment was in a dilemma.\r\n\r\nThe command of the Army of the Potomac was at this juncture offered to\r\nGeneral Shields. I make this statement on the authority of General\r\nShields himself. Following his victory at Winchester, he said, a member\r\nof the cabinet arrived in his camp and on the part of the President\r\nproposed to him the command of the Army of the Potomac. The reasons\r\nsuggested for this tender appeared to be, as I recall them, the\r\nnecessity for a change of leaders owing to previous ill success;\r\nShields’ established capacity for high command, as shown by his career\r\nin Mexico, his recent campaign and the enthusiasm and confidence his\r\nappointment would arouse in the ranks of the army, but the controlling\r\nmotive appeared to be a political consideration—that Shields, because of\r\nhis foreign birth, could not in the event of his success become a\r\npolitical factor or rival in the field of national politics—that is to\r\nsay, in no event would it be possible to make of Shields a candidate for\r\nthe presidency.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe suggestion appears to have been given to Shields in this same\r\ninterview that the President was then contemplating and preparing to\r\nissue the emancipation proclamation. This latter determined Shields’\r\ndecision. He rejected the proposal made to him. This, in substance, is\r\nmy recollection of the statement made by the general during one of his\r\nvisits to Chicago late in the 70’s. Others besides the writer heard\r\nGeneral Shields make this statement at the time.\r\n\r\nThe President sent Shields’ name to the Senate for confirmation as major\r\ngeneral, and as the appointment was not ratified by that body Shields\r\nresigned and withdrew from the army. Likely this may have been partly in\r\nprotest against the threatened emancipation policy. At all events,\r\nShields returned to California. From there he shortly afterward removed\r\nto Missouri, settling on a farm near Carrollton in that state and\r\ndevoting himself to the labors and duties of farm life. In 1877 he was\r\nelected member of the general assembly of Missouri, and the same year\r\nappointed adjutant general of the state militia. The death of Senator\r\nBogg the next year caused a vacancy in the representation of Missouri in\r\nthe United States Senate, and General Shields was appointed, thus giving\r\nhim the distinction of having served in the United States Senate from\r\nthree different states.\r\n\r\nThe term was short, and with its termination may be said ended General\r\nShields’ public service as a legislator and statesman. He nevertheless\r\ncontinued an interesting figure before the public, appearing on many\r\noccasions in different cities as a lecturer and for addresses on various\r\nsubjects of general interest. It was while engaged in a lecturing tour\r\nthat the end came. He died suddenly while visiting a convent in Ottumwa,\r\nIowa, June 1, 1879.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew men in public life have filled so many and so various offices and\r\nemployments. He had been school teacher, lawyer, legislator, jurist,\r\nstate auditor, land commissioner, general in the Mexican and Civil wars,\r\nUnited States senator, adjutant general, farmer and lecturer. He might\r\nhave been governor of Oregon, commander of the papal army and of the\r\narmy of the Potomac (possibly), and he could have led the Fenians in\r\ntheir foolish raid on Canada had not his good common sense rejected the\r\noffer and condemned the project.\r\n\r\nGeneral Shields was warm and earnest in his Irish sympathies, and he\r\nshowed this on many public occasions. It is to his honor that he lived\r\nand died a poor man. He never profited or sought to profit by the\r\nmultiplied opportunities for personal gain which must have been open to\r\nhim during his public career. In his old age, after all his notable\r\nservices, he was receiving a pension of only $34 per month, and when he\r\ndied all that he left his family was the farm, the swords voted to him\r\nby Illinois and South Carolina—and an untarnished name.\r\n\r\nIllinois has since honored the memory of her one-time senator and\r\ngeneral by causing his statue to be placed in the National Capitol. This\r\nwas due largely to the active efforts and enthusiasm of a well-known\r\nChicago attorney, William H. Condon, since dead, who also published the\r\nlife of General James Shields.\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE FRENCH-IRISH BRIGADES IN THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\nThe signal and important services of the French-Irish regiments in the\r\nAmerican revolutionary war have scarcely ever found adequate recognition\r\nand acknowledgement at the hands of historical writers. Indeed, the same\r\nmay be said of the great part France had in that war.\r\n\r\nOf course, every school boy has read of the exploits of the youthful and\r\nenthusiastic Lafayette, and knows that Rochambeau with his army and De\r\nGrasse with his fleet were conspicuous in bringing about the surrender\r\nof Cornwallis and his forces at Yorktown. Only by the powerful\r\nco-operation of the French army and navy at the siege was the crowning\r\nvictory of the war achieved, and that victory forced from the English\r\nking and his ministers the recognition of American independence. All\r\nthis is well known, but the magnitude of the French aid all through the\r\nwar is less familiar to the general reader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. HENRY GROVES CONNOR,\r\n\r\n  of Raleigh, N. C.\r\n\r\n  An Eminent Jurist and Learned Historian.\r\n\r\n  Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe army and navy registers in the French archives show that sixty-three\r\nships of war, mounting 3,668 guns, manned by 32,600 officers and seamen,\r\nwere employed in the naval operations on the American seaboard, and\r\nupward of 12,000 land forces. The financial cost to France of the fleets\r\nand armies and the loans and gifts in money to the colonies have been\r\ncomputed by a competent authority at $50,000,000.\r\n\r\nMy present design in this sketch is to emphasize the part the Irish\r\nbrigades in the French army had in the American war. I do not need to\r\nrecall to mind the historic renown of the Irish Brigade.\r\n\r\nAlmost every battlefield in Europe during the seventeenth century was\r\nflamed by their valor and crimsoned with their blood. In France, in\r\nItaly, in Spain and in the Low Countries these exiled soldiers fought\r\nwith such furious impetuosity that even the bitterest enemies of their\r\nrace were forced to pay them the reluctant tribute of their admiration.\r\n\r\nKing George II. is said to have exclaimed after witnessing the bravery\r\nof the Irish brigade at the battle of Dettingen: “Cursed be the laws\r\nthat deprive me of such subjects.”\r\n\r\nWhen the colonies had declared their independence of Great Britain and\r\nthe aid of France was eagerly invoked the Irish troops in the French\r\narmy pressed their request on the war office in Paris that they should\r\nbe sent to America to fight the British, who were, they declared, their\r\nhereditary enemies. A copy of the French original of this document may\r\nbe seen in the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin. In 1779 several Irish\r\nregiments were embarked in the French fleets for service against the\r\nEnglish forces in the West Indies and on the American coast. Included in\r\nthis contingent were the regiments of Dillon, Walsh, Berwick and Fermoy.\r\nThese regiments being so designated in compliment to the colonel in\r\ncommand as the “Colonel Proprietaire.” In the fleet of the Count\r\nd’Estaing there was carried a considerable land force—mostly of the\r\nIrish brigade. Count Dillon was second in command to the admiral and at\r\nthe siege of Savannah, then held by the British, he led his own regiment\r\nin the attack on the defenses.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was, also, on the land side, an American co-operating force\r\ncommanded by General Lincoln. The assault ended disastrously for both\r\nthe French and Americans with severe loss in killed and wounded. Upward\r\nof 1,200 of the assaulting columns fell in the space of fifty minutes;\r\nof these 821 were of the French forces and the rest of the American. The\r\nutmost bravery was shown, both in the attack and in the defense, but the\r\nstorming column, led by Count d’Estaing and Dillon, could not withstand\r\nthe terrific fire of the batteries and were forced to abandon the\r\nassault.\r\n\r\nD’Estaing was wounded and carried off the field. The gallant Pole, Count\r\nPulaski, who served with the American forces, was killed. He was in\r\ncommand of a small force of regular cavalry of lancers. Among the list\r\nof the killed and wounded of the French attacking column I find the\r\nnames of Brow, major in Dillon’s regiment; Moran and O’Neill, captains;\r\nTauffe, lieutenant, and many other familiar Irish names; officers and\r\nsubofficers of the brigade. The names of the rank and file are not\r\ngiven, but it is not difficult to surmise what must have been the\r\ngallantry of the assault when we see the heavy list of the killed and\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe particulars of the memorable attack on Savannah are given with great\r\nfullness in a publication issued many years ago by the Georgia\r\nHistorical Society, compiled from original sources. The gallantry of\r\nSergeant Jasper, an Irishman, at the siege and his heroic death on the\r\nbattlements while attempting to raise thereon the flag of his regiment,\r\nhas immortalized his name and his bravery. A statue of Jasper in one of\r\nthe public squares of Savannah fittingly commemorates the deed and\r\nmemory of the gallant patriot.\r\n\r\nFollowing the abandonment of the siege the French fleet withdrew and\r\nundertook the reduction of several of the English possessions in the\r\nWest Indies. It is not my purpose to follow the subsequent career and\r\nfortunes of the fleet and forces under d’Estaing except to remark that\r\nthe diversion made by these attacks on the islands under the British\r\nflag were naturally important aids to the cause of the colonies, since\r\nthe English forces employed in their defense would otherwise have been\r\nin service, doubtless, in the attempt to subdue the colonies.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am tempted to relate another incident in Count Dillon’s career of\r\nglory in the expeditions that followed the failure at Savannah. He had\r\npart in the attempts made by the French fleet and forces on several of\r\nthe English possessions, notably in the attack made on the Island of St.\r\nEustache.\r\n\r\nThe frigates being unable to approach sufficiently near to the\r\nfortifications to land aid, Dillon, with only 377 men, landed and in\r\nperson led the assault. The Irish were at the head of the column, and\r\nsuch was the impetuosity of the attacking force that 840 regular troops\r\nof the English army laid down their arms and were made prisoners of war\r\nby less than half their number! Later on the Dillon regiment was\r\nemployed in the siege of the important fortress and Island of St.\r\nChristopher, and the place was finally carried, Count Dillon remaining\r\nin command of the island as governor.\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty of peace with France and the colonies, the island,\r\nunder the terms of the treaty, was yielded back to Great Britain.\r\nShortly afterward Dillon paid a visit to London in the train of the\r\nFrench embassy.\r\n\r\nHe was presented at the court and, having paid his respects to the king,\r\nGeorge III., the lord chancellor, Loughborough, who was in attendance,\r\ncrossed over to Dillon and said to him, after some preliminary\r\ncompliments: “I must thank you for the equity and fairness of your\r\ndecisions given whilst you were acting as governor of the island. My\r\ncourt has had occasion to pass on some of the cases you decided and we\r\nfound no occasion to dissent from your judgments.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSad to say, this gallant soldier met his death on the scaffold, at the\r\nhands of the ruffians who were in the ascendance during the French\r\nrevolution, as did so many thousands of the noblest and best of French\r\nmen and women.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment, as he stood at the foot of the fatal guillotine, a\r\nlady who preceded him and who, like Dillon, was to meet her doom by the\r\norder of the same furies, turned to the count, saying: “Would you not\r\noblige me by going first?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, madam,” was the answer of the chivalric Irishman, and\r\nascending before the lady, in a moment the horrible instrument had ended\r\nthe career of the heroic Count Arthur Dillon.\r\n\r\nA namesake, Colonel Theobald Dillon, who had been with Rochambeau at\r\nYorktown, was another of the victims of the French Revolution, under\r\ncircumstances even more revolting. But I must stay my pen on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe erection of the monument or statue of Lafayette in Paris a few years\r\nback, as a token and testimony of America’s gratitude to France, has\r\nsince then been supplemented by the installation of a fine statue of\r\nRochambeau in Washington—a like tribute to the value and importance of\r\nthe aid given by France in the critical period of the Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of the Rochambeau statue, which is one of the finest\r\nand most impressive in the nation’s capital, was made the occasion of\r\nceremonies and exercises of the highest dignity and importance. Of\r\ncourse, these were reported with great fullness at the time, and I have\r\nno need to dwell on the details now.\r\n\r\nThe government, by the action of Congress, has since published a large\r\nvolume in which is given, I may say, not only a full narrative of all\r\nthe proceedings in connection with the statue, but also a comprehensive\r\nstory of French aid and services in the war for colonial independence.\r\n\r\nThe volume includes the “roster” of the French naval and military\r\nforces. The Irish regiments to which I have referred, of course, are\r\ngiven due notice, like the others; that is to say, the name of the\r\nregiment, together with the list of the chief officers, etc. Count\r\nDillon’s regiment was present at the surrender of Cornwallis and the\r\nBritish army at Yorktown. The count himself was not there, being\r\noccupied at his post as governor of the island already referred to. His\r\ncousin, Colonel Theobald Dillon, was there, and many other French-Irish\r\nofficers of the brigade.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest to many to learn that efforts have been made to\r\nobtain from the French war office a full list of the officers and\r\nsoldiers of the Irish brigades who served in the war of the American\r\nrevolution. I am happy to state that a volume will soon be issued by the\r\nFrench government containing these names. The search for the necessary\r\ndata was instituted at the request of M. Jusserand, the learned and\r\naccomplished French ambassador at Washington.\r\n\r\nI trust I am not betraying a secret in stating that the initiative in\r\nthe task of Irish historic interest has been due to Archbishop Ireland,\r\nwho was himself a conspicuous figure in the ceremonies attending the\r\ncelebration for Lafayette in Paris, and in the Rochambeau exercises at\r\nWashington and New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BISHOP BERKELEY AND HIS PLANS FOR A GREAT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\nThe records of Yale College bear testimony to the beneficence and\r\nliberality of an Irish bishop who, early in the eighteenth century, gave\r\nproof of his zeal for learning by bestowing on that institution, then\r\nlately founded—its charter is dated 1701—the dwelling house and farm in\r\nRhode Island which he had purchased and occupied during his strange\r\nvisit and sojourn in America.\r\n\r\nThe bishop likewise gave to the college on his departure the best and\r\nlargest collection of books—nearly one thousand volumes—that had ever up\r\nto that time been brought over. The catalogue, or list of these works,\r\nis preserved in the Yale College library. Harvard is likewise indebted\r\nto the same benefactor for a collection of textbooks.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBishop George Berkeley was a remarkable character in his day. An account\r\nof his career cannot but possess a certain interest for the general\r\nreader. He was the friend and associate of many of the literary\r\ncelebrities of the time, Dean Swift, Addison and Steele, who esteemed\r\nhis friendship and appreciated his amiable character and qualities.\r\n\r\nBerkeley was born in the County Kilkenny, Ireland, the same year that\r\nJames II. succeeded to the British crown. His early education was\r\nacquired in the same school in Kilkenny which Dean Swift had attended,\r\nand his subsequent studies were pursued at Trinity College, Dublin. It\r\nwas said of him while at college that he was regarded by some of his\r\nfellow students as the greatest dunce in the institution, while others\r\nthought him a prodigy of learning and goodness, but all agreed that he\r\nwas full of simplicity and enthusiasm—indeed, these latter\r\ncharacteristics remained with him through life. The results of his\r\napplication to study is shown by his college record. He was elected\r\n“scholar” in 1702, a B. A. in 1704, and obtained his master’s degree in\r\n1707, and the same year was admitted to a fellowship. The drift of his\r\nmind and of his studies was shown in the formation of a college society\r\n“to promote investigations in the new philosophy of Boyle, Newton and\r\nLocke,” a subject upon which he wrote many papers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore leaving college to enter on his career in London, Berkeley had\r\nalready acquired some reputation as a writer on philosophical subjects.\r\nIt was Dean Swift who introduced his fellow countryman to the circles of\r\ninfluence in the British capital. In the “Journal to Stella,” the dean\r\njots down under date of April 12, 1713: “I went to court today on\r\npurpose to present Mr. Berkeley, one of our fellows of Trinity College.\r\nThis Mr. Berkeley is a very ingenious man and great philosopher, and I\r\nhave mentioned him to all the ministers, and have given them some of his\r\nwritings, and I will favor him as much as I can. This, I think, I am\r\nbound to—in honor and conscience to use all my little credit toward\r\nhelping forward men of worth in the world.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSwift introduced Berkeley to the Earl of Peterborough, then one of the\r\nmost extraordinary characters in Europe. He had amazed the country a few\r\nyears before by his wonderful achievements in Spain, during the war of\r\nthe succession. Soldier, scholar and diplomatist, this singular man was\r\neccentric in all his movements and actions—indeed, his career and\r\ncharacter is still a favorite study and an enigma for the historian and\r\nbiographer. The introduction obtained for Berkeley, the post of the\r\nchaplain and secretary to Peterborough, who had been appointed\r\nambassador to the King of Sicily. It was little use the eccentric earl\r\nhad for a chaplain, since he was himself a well-known skeptic and\r\nfreethinker!\r\n\r\nThe post to which he had been appointed gave Berkeley the opportunity of\r\nmaking acquaintance with the continent—he had taken “orders” before\r\nTrinity College—and he now saw France and Italy for the first time. His\r\nletters describing his experience and observations in these countries\r\nare exceedingly interesting, but my limits will not admit of quotations.\r\nThe death of Queen Anne during his sojourn abroad and the accession of\r\nGeorge I. caused a change in his prospects and position. Peterborough\r\nwas recalled by the new administration, and consequently Berkeley\r\nreturned to England in August, 1714.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe change of administration in England blighted for a time Berkeley’s\r\nprospects of preferment. His friend, Dean Swift, was no longer in the\r\nascendant, and his late patron, the Earl of Peterborough, had been\r\ndeprived of place and influence. He was, nevertheless, a welcome guest\r\nand visitor in literary circles and in general society. He possessed a\r\ncharm of address and manners that won friends to him on all sides. He\r\nshortly had the opportunity again to revisit the continent—this time as\r\ncompanion and tutor to the son of Sir George Ashe. While in Paris he had\r\nan interview and carried on a discussion with the celebrated Malebranche\r\non points of philosophy and metaphysics which, it is said, became so\r\nanimated and exciting that the Frenchman brought on himself a violent\r\ndisorder which prostrated him and resulted in his death within a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence this time of five years Berkeley returned to England in\r\n1720. He found the country in turmoil over the collapse of the South Sea\r\nbubble. The speculative mania which had spread widely in England led as\r\nusual to an era of extravagance and corruption. The disorders of society\r\nconsequent on these conditions was general. Berkeley gave vent to his\r\nfeelings on the situation by an essay that attracted wide attention, in\r\nwhich he sought to point out a remedy for the prevailing evils.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis suggestions may be briefly quoted as bearing equally on certain\r\nconditions not altogether unfamiliar to us in the United States. He\r\nargued that the persons who compose society must become individually\r\nindustrious, frugal, public-spirited and religious. Sumptuary laws, he\r\nthought, might do something toward mitigating existing distress, and\r\npublic amusements might be regulated, and masquerades prohibited. The\r\ndrama, too, should be reformed. But the prime necessity was that\r\nsensuality must give way to religious love and reverence. “Let us be\r\nindustrious, frugal and religious, if we are to be saved at all,” was\r\nhis counsel.\r\n\r\nIn 1721 he returned to Ireland, from which he had been so long absent.\r\nHe had retained all along his post in Trinity College, and was now\r\nshortly installed as chaplain to the Duke of Trafton, the viceroy.\r\n\r\nThere occurred in 1723 a curious and romantic incident in which Swift\r\nwas concerned, or rather “Vanessa”—one of the two unhappy women whose\r\npassion for and devotion to the cynical dean have become familiar to all\r\nreaders. Vanessa, like Stella, the other victim of unrequited affection,\r\nfollowed the dean to Dublin, and there learned of Swift’s connection\r\nwith Stella—to whom he had been secretly married. Heart-crushed by the\r\nrevelation, she revoked a will she had made in favor of the man she\r\nloved, and substituted Berkeley as the beneficiary and legatee. This is\r\nall the more curious and unaccountable as Vanessa (Esther Vanhumrigh)\r\nseems to have met Berkeley but once, and that only by chance. At all\r\nevents he was the gainer by some 4,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFortune had begun to favor him. He was appointed dean of Derry\r\n(Londonderry), an important ecclesiastical dignity in the Irish church,\r\nsaid to be worth £1,100 a year. While in possession of this lucrative\r\nposition the project of the great university in the new world seems to\r\nhave taken root in his mind, and quickly became a passionate enthusiasm.\r\nThis is the project which links Berkeley’s name with America—indeed it\r\nwas to recall his romantic initiative and devotion to this early scheme\r\nfor higher education that I venture on this sketch.\r\n\r\nSwift says the design had been long in Berkeley’s mind. His generous aim\r\ninvolved the surrender of his opulent position as dean, and the\r\nemployment of his means, including the Vanessa legacy, in promoting this\r\nproject, on which he had evidently set his heart, and it also\r\nnecessitated other sacrifices as we shall see. Of course, it was not\r\npossible for him unaided to carry out or even to begin his undertaking.\r\nHe relied on obtaining aid from sympathizers, and an indispensable\r\ncharter from the king, George I.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that he was indebted to a Catholic—the Abbe\r\nGualteri, whom he had met in Italy—for the opportunity of making his\r\napplication to the king under favorable conditions. The abbe was a\r\ndistinguished Venetian scientist, who had the ear of court circles, and\r\nhe interested himself warmly in Berkeley’s behalf, with the result that\r\na charter was granted in June, 1725, for a college in the Island of\r\nBermuda, and constituting “Dr. Berkeley, Dean of Londonderry, principal\r\nof said college.”\r\n\r\nBerkeley’s enthusiasm and persuasive eloquence enlisted promise of\r\nsupport in other powerful quarters. The prime minister, Sir Robert\r\nWalpole, promised a grant of £20,000; the private subscriptions seem to\r\nhave aggregated about £5,000.\r\n\r\nAll this took time and extensive preparation. The doctor or dean had\r\nsecured the co-operation of several of the Trinity College fellows, who\r\nagreed to go out with him, and there was to be another addition to the\r\nparty who was to intimately share the principal’s life and fortunes\r\nthenceforth—Mrs. Berkeley!\r\n\r\nHe had married during the progress of his negotiations for the\r\nuniversity scheme, a daughter of the speaker of the Irish house of\r\ncommons. The marriage took place August 1, 1728. It was said of Mrs.\r\nBerkeley that “she shared his fortune when he was about to engage in one\r\nof the most romantic moral movements of modern times, and when, in love\r\nwith an ideal academic life in the Bermudas, he prepared to surrender\r\npreferment and social position at home in order to devote the remainder\r\nof his life to the great continent of the West.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the fullest confidence that he would be able to carry out\r\nsuccessfully his favorite designs, Berkeley, with his wife and college\r\ncompanions, set sail for the sunny isle in the golden West, of which he\r\nhad so long dreamed. He was then in his forty-fourth year. The voyage\r\noccupied four months, and the landing was made at Newport, R. I., where\r\nhe had planned to sojourn until he should receive from England the\r\npromised grant from the government. It was necessary also that the good\r\nwill and practical interest of the New England colonies should be\r\nenlisted in his efforts.\r\n\r\nThe population of Newport at this time is said to have been curiously\r\ncosmopolitan. As religious freedom prevailed there, thanks to the\r\nQuaker, Roger Williams, and was unknown in the other New England\r\ncolonies, religious refugees found an asylum, as they did in the\r\nCatholic colony of Maryland under Lord Baltimore. The merchants of\r\nNewport appear to have been active and successful in the slave trade, so\r\nwe shall be less surprised at the statement that Berkeley purchased\r\nseveral for service on the farm which he speedily acquired and settled\r\non for the time being.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBerkeley was quite in demand for sermons. He preached in Trinity Church,\r\nNewport, three days after his arrival, and many times afterward. The\r\nRhode Island aristocracy of those days maintained, according to\r\naccounts, a good deal of the style and manner of life of the English\r\ngentry, and we can read of fox hunting, and races, and festivities of\r\nvarious kinds as commonly indulged in. The delays reported from London,\r\nin carrying out the promises of aid gave Berkeley many anxious hours in\r\nhis new world home. He found it expedient to build a house on the farm\r\nin the interior, at Whitehall, which he continued to occupy with his\r\nfamily until he sailed back to England. His house became the resort of\r\nthe ministers and gentry of Rhode Island, who delighted in the society\r\nand conversation of the accomplished Irish dean.\r\n\r\nNearly three years passed in waiting and in expectation of the promised\r\nmeans which never materialized, beyond the sum of private\r\nsubscriptions—which he afterward scrupulously returned. Meantime two\r\nchildren were born to him; one of these, a girl, died and was buried in\r\nTrinity churchyard, Newport. Three of Berkeley’s slaves, according to\r\nthe records of the same church—“Philip Berkeley, Anthony Berkeley and\r\nAgnes Berkeley, negroes, received into the church, June 11, 1731.”\r\n\r\nAll his plans for the utopia he had nourished in his imagination faded\r\nutterly when authoritative news from London convinced Berkeley that the\r\nproject must be abandoned. The grant of £20,000 assured by Walpole, and\r\nother important concessions, could not be realized. The prime minister\r\nhad given up the project, and employed the proposed grant and\r\nconcessions for other purposes. So in the fall of 1731 the disappointed\r\nphilanthropist bade farewell to the new world and sailed homeward.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBerkeley’s subsequent career must be briefly told. On his return to\r\nLondon he wrote a great deal on his favorite philosophical subjects. In\r\n1734 he was appointed bishop of Cloyne, in Ireland, and there he spent\r\nthe next eighteen years of his life. He gave much attention to the\r\nsocial condition of Ireland, attended to his episcopal duties and\r\noccasionally occupied his seat in the Irish house of lords. His\r\nbenevolence to the poor in the dark days of famine and disease was said\r\nto be boundless. He certainly won the esteem and gratitude of the\r\nCatholics of Ireland by his liberality and his freedom from the spirit\r\nof cant and proselytizing, then unhappily widespread in that unfortunate\r\ncountry. His advocacy of tar water as a universal specific for the cure\r\nof disease will be remembered as an example of his amiable philanthropic\r\nenthusiasms. He publishes a poem in praise of his panacea. He was\r\noffered further promotion in the Irish church—even the primacy; but he\r\nput these allurements aside and refused. “For doing good to the world,”\r\nhe declared, “I may upon the whole do as much in a lower station.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1752 he decided to resign his bishopric and seek retirement at\r\nOxford. The unusual proposal excited the curiosity of the King, George\r\nII., who declared, when the application was made to him, that Berkeley\r\nmight live where he pleased but that he should die a bishop! So he was\r\npermitted to retire from his see, still retaining his Episcopal rank.\r\n\r\nHe did not long enjoy the change. He died in Oxford the 14th of January,\r\n1753, and was buried in the university chapel of Christ Church. His\r\nwidow survived him thirty-three years, dying in her 86th year. A son and\r\na daughter were living at the time of his death. In his will he provided\r\namong other items—“that the expense of my funeral do not exceed £20, and\r\nthat as much more be given to the poor of the parish where I die.” He\r\nleft a very small estate. The well-known lines of his poem, in which he\r\nsought to depict the prospects of his utopian project, may fitly close\r\nthis sketch of the amiable and benevolent Irish dean and bishop:\r\n\r\n             Westward, the course of empire takes its way,\r\n               The four first acts already past;\r\n             A fifth shall close the drama with the day,\r\n               Time’s noblest offspring is the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE RENAMING OF WOLHURST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following remarks were made by President Taft in renaming\r\n“Wolhurst,” the estate of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas F. Walsh, “Clonmel,” on\r\nSeptember 22, 1909:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\n  I think our bounteous and generous and lovely hostess and our host\r\n  should have called in the clerical profession rather than a politician\r\n  to baptize this new home, for it is a part of their profession, I\r\n  think, to make sacred places that we all venerate; but I hope to be\r\n  able to prove equal to the occasion, because a politician is subject\r\n  to every sort of exigency. Because I am asked I re-baptize with great\r\n  pleasure this beautiful estate and call it “_Clonmel_.” “_Clonmel_” is\r\n  a beautiful place in the County Tipperary. The determined immigrants\r\n  from Tipperary and from every part of the Emerald Isle have come to\r\n  the front as they deserved in America. There is no element and no\r\n  strain in our civilization that has manifested itself to be stronger,\r\n  more enterprising, more shrewd in business, more tenacious of its\r\n  principles than the Irishmen, from North and South, who come to this\r\n  country to make it their own.\r\n\r\n  I have the greatest pleasure in calling this place after that\r\n  beautiful town in the golden vale of Tipperary. I consecrate this the\r\n  estate of “_Clonmel_.” I wish I could connect with it in some way the\r\n  name of _Walsh_, but as that goes without saying, both in Denver and\r\n  throughout the country, it is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  I congratulate the people of this vicinity that Mr. and Mrs. Walsh are\r\n  their neighbors. We in Washington feel delighted that they are\r\n  neighbors of ours. Their generosity and kindly courtesy are known the\r\n  country over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              HISTORICAL FALSIFICATIONS AGAINST THE IRISH.\r\n\r\n BY CAPT. JAMES CONNOLLY, VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY FOR CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of Scotch and English falsification of history against the\r\nIrish dates as far back as the end of the eleventh century. Taking full\r\nadvantage of the civilization and education which the Irish Monks had\r\ngratuitously carried to them over seas and spent the best of their\r\nlifetime in diffusing amongst them, they used the very power with which\r\nthe Monks thus endowed them to betray and despoil their benefactors.\r\n\r\n“Those brilliant names in the history of European scholarship, who\r\ndistinguished themselves under Charlemagne, and his son and his\r\ngrandson, Clemens, Ducil and Scotus Erigena, who all taught in the Court\r\nschools, Dungal, who taught in Pavia, Sedalius, who worked in Luttich,\r\nFergual who ruled in Salzburg and Morngal, the teacher of St. Gall, were\r\nnot altogether without successors,” says Douglas Hyde, in his Literary\r\nHistory of Ireland.\r\n\r\n“It is true,” he goes on, “that Ireland’s great mission of instruction\r\nand conversion came to a close with the eleventh century, yet for two\r\ncenturies more, driven by the innate instinct for travel and adventure\r\nwhich was so strong within them that it resembled a second nature, we\r\nfind Irish monks new foundations on the continent, especially in\r\nGermany.” The number of monasteries which Dr. Hyde names as being\r\nfounded by these Irish monks on the continent during the next half\r\ncentury is simply amazing. “Most of these monks who came from Ireland\r\nbrought books with them which they presented to the German monasteries.”\r\nSays Dr. Hyde again:\r\n\r\n“The century which succeeded the Battle of Clontarf, was the most\r\nflourishing period of Irish monks in Germany. Once the English had\r\ncommenced the conquest of Ireland the monasteries ceased to be recruited\r\nby men of sanctity and learning but were resorted to by men who sought\r\nrather material comfort and a life of worldly freedom. The result was,\r\nthat towards the end of the thirteenth century most of the Irish\r\nestablishments in Germany had come to an end, being made over to the\r\nGermans, like those of Vienna and Wurzburg, or else altogether losing\r\ntheir monastic character like that of Vuremberg.\r\n\r\n“As for the parent monastery of St. James of Ratisbon, its fate was most\r\nextraordinary and deserves to be told at greater length. It had, of\r\ncourse, always been from its foundation, inhabited by Irish monks alone,\r\nand was known as the monasterium Scotorum, or monastery of Irishmen. But\r\nwhen in process of time the word Scotus became ambiguous, or rather had\r\ncome to be exclusively applied to what we now call Scotchmen, the Scotch\r\nprudently took advantage of it, and claimed that they and not the Irish\r\nwere the real founders of Ratisbon and its kindred institutions, and\r\nthat the designation monasterium Scotorum proved it, but the Irish had\r\ngradually and unlawfully intruded themselves into these institutions\r\nwhich did not belong to them. Accordingly it came to pass, by the very\r\nirony of fate—analogous to that which made English writers of the last\r\ncentury claim Irish books and Irish script as Anglo-Saxon—that the great\r\nparent monastery of St. James of Ratisbon was actually given up to the\r\nScotch by Leo X., in 1515, and all the unfortunate Irish monks there\r\nliving were driven out. The Scotch, however, do not seem to have made\r\nmuch of their new abode, for though the monastery contained some able\r\nmen during the first century of its occupation by them, it exercised,\r\nsays Zimmer, no influence worth mentioning upon the general cultivation\r\nof the German people of that region and may be considered but a small\r\ncontribution towards medieval culture in general, for the only share the\r\nScotch monks can really claim in a monument like that of the church of\r\nSt. James of Ratisbon is the fact of their having collected the gold for\r\nits erection from the pockets of the Germans. In comparison with these,\r\nhow noble appear to us those apostles from Ireland of whom we find so\r\nmany traces in different parts of the kingdom, of the monks from the\r\nbeginning of the seventh to the end of the tenth century.”\r\n\r\nHow well Germany remembers her debt of gratitude to those early Irish\r\nmonks was most eloquently expressed at the great German Catholic\r\nCongress at Dusseldorf, less than a year ago. A pilgrimage of the\r\ndelegates to Keiserswerth to visit the grave of St. Suitbertus, the\r\nfirst Irish monk who spread the light of faith and learning in that\r\nland. During this pilgrimage Cardinal Fischer delivered an eloquent\r\ndiscourse on the brotherhood of nations in faith and spoke feelingly on\r\nthe debt of Catholic Germany to the missionary monks of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe one egregious thing which the reading of English history teaches is\r\nthe English historian’s palpable inability to be candid and unbiased\r\nwhen he comes to deal with Ireland and the Irish. With the true-born\r\nEnglishman this innate prejudice against his neighboring island and her\r\npeople comes to him as a heritage of many ages. It is deep-rooted in his\r\nvery nature and is nourished and fructified by his inordinate vanity and\r\nsuper-consciousness of his own real or imaginary superiority. The\r\naverage Englishman believes himself and his little islanders to be\r\ndivinely endowed with prerogatives and powers to govern the rest of the\r\nworld in their own way. He goes about it in a supercilious, patronizing\r\nsort of fashion as though he were conferring an unspeakable kindness on\r\nthe governed, even while he is shooting or bayoneting him into\r\nsubmission to his law.\r\n\r\nThe very fact, unnatural as it is, that the Englishman believes himself\r\nright and just in all this inhumanity should seem at least to be some\r\npalliation of his offences. But failing utterly to make the thus\r\ngoverned see his treatment of them in any such “kindly light” he governs\r\nthem the more.\r\n\r\nJohn Bull is, in fact, about the only ruler in the governing business\r\nwho seems not to have yet learned that a people who are least governed\r\nare best governed. He has exploited his monarchical powers on about\r\nevery continent and ocean of the globe with more or less success. The\r\nmore heroic and manly was the resistance of a smaller country and weaker\r\npeople to his invasions the more he misrepresented and traduced them in\r\nhis press and on his platforms. England’s main purpose in this has even\r\nbeen to lower, even abase the countries and peoples which she has thus\r\nassailed, in the estimation of other nations. Nothing can be more\r\noffensive to the delicate sensibilities of truth and justice than the\r\nfalse show of benevolent unselfishness with which England has embarked\r\nupon her campaigns of conquest. She has ever been conspicuously,\r\nunmercifully cruel to her Irish subjects in their protests against her\r\noppression. There is scarcely any limit to the extremes into which an\r\nindividual or a nation’s vanity may lead them. England’s claiming\r\nIrishmen of great distinction in arts, arms, statesmanship, and the like\r\nto be real Englishmen is probably the most absurd case in point.\r\n\r\nBut it was left to the Scotch historian, David Hume, to most falsely and\r\nmalevolently chronicle the dominant characteristics of the Irish people.\r\nHe was, of course, writing English history from the then English\r\nstandard viewpoint, at the time when the American colonists were about\r\nto rebel against the intolerable tyranny of George III. The Sons and\r\nDaughters of Liberty were, in fact, holding their meetings under the old\r\nLiberty tree in Boston at the very time Hume was writing his most false\r\nannals of Ireland and the Irish. Hearing of Jerry O’Brien’s capture of\r\nthe British schooner Margaretta, in Machias Bay, several months before\r\nthe Battle of Bunker Hill, no doubt intensified Hume’s dislike of the\r\nIrish. Nor does that “flavor of the old classical culture of Scotland,”\r\npervading his work extenuate in the least the enormity of his falsehood.\r\nNay, the very fact that he must have known better—he to whom was given\r\nas a historian “first rank among English writers,”—makes his offence\r\nagainst intellectual integrity all the more despicable. And yet it has\r\nbeen by just such means as this that England has, throughout the past\r\nten centuries, succeeded in keeping the greater part of the rest of the\r\nworld more or less ignorant of the real characteristics and acquirements\r\nof the Irish.\r\n\r\nOn page 99, Vol. 1, of Hume’s History of England, writing of the “State\r\nof Ireland—1172,” he says: “The Irish from the beginning of time had\r\nbeen buried in the most profound _barbarism_ and _ignorance_....”\r\n\r\nNow, with Hume’s wide knowledge of the civilized world, it can scarcely\r\nbe believed that he wrote in real ignorance of the general status of the\r\nIrish people. His classical culture and profound erudition must\r\ncertainly have enabled him to know the real facts in the case. He could\r\nnot have so closely surveyed and studied the past history of “the Irish”\r\nwithout knowing that for centuries before the time of which he wrote,\r\nIreland had excelled England in culture “to a very marked degree.” It\r\nhad, indeed, been the custom for ages for the better class of Englishmen\r\nto not only send their sons to Ireland but to go themselves for their\r\neducation, that they might learn Irish Gaelic, so that by means of it\r\nthey might study Greek and Latin. “The fame of these early Irish\r\nschools,” says Dr. Douglas Hyde in his Literary History of Ireland, page\r\n220, “attracted students in the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries from\r\nall quarters to Ireland, which had now become a veritable land of\r\nschools and scholars.” English, French and German princes flocked to\r\nIreland to reap the benefits of the better educational advantages there\r\nthan were to be had in their own countries. King Alfred of Northumbria,\r\nwho was educated in Ireland, had been so pleased with the Irish ways\r\nthat he ever after “aided and abetted the Irish in England in opposition\r\nto Wilfred, who opposed them.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HONORABLE JOHN B. O’MEARA,\r\n\r\n  Of St. Louis.\r\n\r\n  Ex-Lieutenant-Governor of Missouri, and\r\n  Vice-President of the Society for Missouri.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut the brilliant Irish scholar, Johannas Scotus Erigend, finally went\r\nover to England for the sole purpose of establishing at Oxford\r\nUniversity the beginning of classical learning on English soil. He was\r\nalso summoned to France by King Charles the Bold to lay the foundation\r\nof the classics in his kingdom. Yet for more than a century after the\r\nclassics had been established at Oxford, well-born Englishmen continued\r\nto send their sons to Ireland, where the older seats of such learning\r\noffered more effective advantages for such studies. Nor was it for the\r\nstudy of the Humanities alone that they were sent. The arts of writing,\r\nilluminating and music were also taught with the success that is made\r\npossible only by centuries of cultured experience.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of King Edward’s last visit to Ireland at that time, Harper’s\r\nWeekly recently said, editorially, after relating in detail the many\r\nother ways in which “Ireland was England’s superior in culture” ... “the\r\nHarp, which is the National symbol of Ireland, is really the record of\r\ncenturies of Musical culture.”\r\n\r\nKnowing, as King Alfred certainly must have known, that as early as the\r\nbeginning of the sixth century the heathen classics were taught by\r\nlearned Irish monks in their schools of theology, it is easily\r\nunderstood how he came to have such admiration for the Irish and\r\nIreland. Their skill in Greek and Latin poetry as well as in Irish\r\nappealed to him so that on leaving Ireland he wrote a poem of sixty\r\nlines in the Irish bardic manner. In this poem he compliments the five\r\nprovinces for their several hospitalities and courtesies to himself. It\r\nbreathes the spirit of thankful gratitude to the whole nation for all it\r\nhad done for him.\r\n\r\nNo people buried in barbarism and ignorance “from the beginning of time”\r\ncould have evoked such a tribute to their culture and hospitality as\r\nthat, from an English King whom they had educated. (Pardon the\r\nhyperbole.)\r\n\r\nBut it had not yet become the well established custom and purpose of the\r\nwriters of English history to pervert their chronicles so as to traduce\r\nthe Irish people all that their subject matter would bear without\r\nseeming to be deliberate untruth. There was, in fact, no English\r\nhistorian at all at the time Ireland’s scholars were thus laying the\r\nfoundations of classical learning over a great part of Europe. The\r\ncrowds of strangers that were meantime flocking to Ireland to receive\r\nthe classical educations which could not be had in their own countries\r\nwere not only warmly welcomed but were entertained and fed every day\r\nfree of cost. Free books were furnished them and they were given\r\ngratuitous instructions by the Irish masters.\r\n\r\nIn this atmosphere of culture, hospitality and true Christian refinement\r\nwas fostered that love of learning and of the unselfish characters of\r\nthe men who imparted it to those strange princes and kings, which they\r\ntook home with them to their own countries. Englishmen, especially, had\r\nlong looked upon Ireland as “the land of scholars and the nurse of\r\narms.”\r\n\r\nThis marvelous educational activity and open-handed generosity of the\r\nIrish had, in fact, become the wonder and admiration of the nations\r\nwhose sons were being most benefited thereby. “This outburst of\r\nreligious zeal, glorious and enduring as it was,” says Dr. Hyde,\r\n“carried with it, like all sudden and powerful movements, an element of\r\ndanger.” The danger to which he here refers was that of a clash between\r\nthe civil and religious authorities on some minor points of the\r\nadministration of justice at home. Such obstacles in the way of human\r\nand spiritual amity seem to have never been for long inseparable from\r\nthe lives of nations. They spring up suddenly. They are balked at for a\r\ntime, and it often seems as if such barriers were destined to be the\r\nstumbling blocks over which kingdoms would fall.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until the Norman invasion and complete subjugation of\r\nEngland, and Norman laws, customs and ideals had completely dominated\r\nthat country and the semi-Latin tongue now known as English had taken\r\nthe place of the Anglo-Saxon spoken till the Normans came, that the real\r\nbreach of amity between the English and Irish happened.\r\n\r\nIt was against the aggressive spirit of this Anglo-Norman power that\r\nIreland first rebelled and rebels to this day. The Normans found the\r\nconquest of Ireland a far more difficult undertaking. They were, it is\r\ntrue, by their under-handed system of parceling out portions of the\r\nconquered sections to the traitor native chiefs, successful in dividing\r\nIreland against herself. Yet during all the centuries of the persecution\r\nmade possible by the weakness caused by this division, the Normans\r\nfailed to dominate Ireland. The free Irish spirit outlived those\r\ncenturies of “warfare and famine and prison.” Throughout the greater\r\npart of that beleaguered land Irish princes and Irish laws ruled. The\r\nsoul of the nation was nurtured and sustained by the continued use of\r\nthe mother tongue. To the ranks of the native Irish who were rendered\r\ndisloyal to their country by Norman influences, the religious schism of\r\nthe Reformation added many more. Cromwell’s disastrous invasion nearly a\r\ncentury later cut still wider gaps in the loyal ranks of the Irish. In\r\naddition to those who were starved or persecuted into submission to\r\nCromwellian rule, many more who could not be tortured into such\r\nsubmission fled the country. Those were “the wild geese,” that flew\r\nhither and yonder, lighting, like birds of passage, where instinct or\r\ndestiny led them.\r\n\r\nBut wherever they found refuge from the iniquitous powers, that thus\r\nmade them exiles, they remained true to the ideals for which they were\r\nbanished. In many instances they became in time honored acquisitions to\r\nthe countries where they found homes, fitting in as leaders in arts,\r\narms and statecraft. All this is, of course, no more than must be\r\nexpected of men possessing heritages of many centuries of freedom, based\r\non the American elective system of choosing their governing officials.\r\nFrom her very earliest colonial days down to the present, America\r\nderived more of her strength from Ireland, numerically as well as\r\notherwise, than from any other single source. However, much of the fact\r\nof Irishmen’s numbers and achievements, in the upbuilding of this nation\r\nmay have been omitted from our histories purposely or knowingly the\r\nfacts remain. These mistakes the future historian must see corrected.\r\nNor this alone. The Hume spirit and atmosphere must be forever\r\neliminated from our history. It was the Hume falsehoods which half a\r\ncentury or more ago created in the youthful American mind such false\r\nimpressions of the Irish character. Bancroft had not yet been introduced\r\nin the public schools during my early school days, so it was from Hume\r\nthat as a twelve-year lad I first learned this false lesson of my native\r\nland. Nor can we wonder that Bancroft, with all his learning, has\r\nsignally failed in many instances to give renowned historical characters\r\ntheir due. This fact came home to me quite recently, while canvassing\r\nfor a petition to a certain congressman, urging him to press the passage\r\nof the bill for an appropriation to erect a monument in Washington to\r\nCommodore Jack Barry, Father of the American Navy. On presenting the\r\npetition the second time to this “representative and influential\r\ncitizen,” he demurred, saying: “I don’t find much of anything about this\r\nBarry, in Bancroft’s History of the United States entitling him to any\r\nsuch honor as you folks are aiming to give him. So I don’t see how I can\r\nsign your petition.”\r\n\r\nSuch mistakes, or intentional omissions, of our country’s history,\r\nmischievous as they may otherwise appear, are here recurred to only to\r\nshow the great need of a true history of the nation. It is no reflection\r\nupon the intellectual integrity of Bancroft to infer that he may have,\r\nin some ways been influenced by Hume, nay, is it not very probable that\r\nhe was in dealing with the Irish heroes of our Army and Navy?\r\n\r\nBut in the light of modern research and scholarly devotion to truth such\r\nold world falsehoods and misrepresentations are being doomed to the\r\noblivion that awaits all such evil doing. The causes and ideals for\r\nwhich Irishmen have lived, fought, suffered and died, need no apologist\r\nor vindicator, ancient, mediæval or modern, since St. Patrick’s time, at\r\nleast. These causes have been mainly God, country, truth and freedom. It\r\nwas Ireland’s devotion to her ideals and her sacrificial tenacity to her\r\ncauses which, of course, led to England’s merciless, wholesale\r\nconfiscation of Irish lands and estates, when she had gained sufficient\r\nmastery there by her Norman intrigues. During the reign of James I.,\r\nIrish commerce and about all Irish industries were destroyed in like\r\nmanner. The Irish schools in which English princes and kings had\r\nreceived their first lessons in classical learning were leveled to the\r\nground, and the schoolmasters forced to teach under hawthornes and\r\nhedges. But even this did not, as was intended by the destroyer, quite\r\ndestroy the love of culture in the Irish heart. Nor did the English\r\nsoldiers’ desecration of the sanctuaries and the banishment of the\r\npriests in the least hinder the continuance of God’s eternal truth. Men\r\ndied manfully for it. But the truth lived on and became more true\r\nbecause of their martyrdom.\r\n\r\nIn every land to which these “wild geese” bore their messages of those\r\neternal verities for which they were banished from their own country,\r\ntheir Irish ideals have, under a more human tolerance than that from\r\nwhich they flew, been steadily extending and exerting more beneficent\r\ninfluences over the lives of men and nations. This could not have been\r\notherwise. Here, where they came more numerously for a century or more\r\nthan was the emigration from nearly all the rest of Europe together,\r\nIrish ideals of the form of the modern elective system of government\r\nhave been more dominantly interwoven into the web of our national life,\r\nmore obvious still is the heritage of ancient Celtic culture to be seen\r\nin American art, literature and hospitality. Too faintly, perhaps, is it\r\nfelt in poetry or heard in music, as if, as in Goldsmith’s time, “they\r\nwept their own decline.” Yet, as the old art spirit seems now to be\r\nsteadily regaining its wonted power, it may shortly overcome the evil\r\ncommercial craze which now infests the earth.\r\n\r\nOxford University, in which, as I have said before, the great Scotus\r\nErigena first established the beginning of classical learning in\r\nEngland, is now having prepared for publication a volume of prose and\r\nverse to be printed in fac simile from old Celtic manuscripts, preserved\r\nin the great Bodleian library. This is being done under the direction of\r\nthe great German scholar, Kunz Meyer. He is writing an introduction and\r\nnotes to the work. No other man living, not even Dr. Douglas Hyde\r\nhimself, is a more profound Gaelic scholar or a more ardent lover of\r\nthat Gaelic culture which, as has been seen, did so much toward the\r\nenlightenment of the world, than he.\r\n\r\nThere are many other notable instances of the healthy and vigorous\r\nrevival of the Gaelic culture spirit and language which space forbids\r\nbeing here added. The selfless interest and liberal aid taken in and\r\nextended to this movement by men of other races evinces the fact that it\r\nis more of a world-wide out-reaching for the lost inestimable treasures\r\nof what the movement means than any narrow exploitation of the\r\nachievements of a single race. If, by means of it we shall succeed in\r\nexpurgating the histories of the civilized world of such pernicious\r\nfalsehoods as that of Hume’s, we shall certainly have conferred a\r\nlasting benefit upon mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE LATE COL. JOHN F. FINERTY.\r\n\r\n                            BY P. T. BARRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCol. John F. Finerty, who died in Chicago on June 10, 1908, was born in\r\nIreland in 1846. In his youth he became connected with the Irish\r\nrevolutionary movement and was forced to leave Ireland in consequence.\r\nHe arrived in America in 1864 and immediately joined a New York\r\nvolunteer regiment in which he served until its disbandment.\r\n\r\nMr. Finerty became connected with the Chicago daily press in 1866. In\r\n1876 he was detailed by Editor Storey of _The Times_ to accompany the\r\ncolumn of General Crook against the hostile Sioux and Cheyenne Indian\r\ntribes. He was present at most of the Indian battles of that memorable\r\nyear and was especially mentioned by General Crook in orders for good\r\nconduct in the field.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 he wrote up, among other things, the Rio Grande frontier trouble\r\nfrom both the Texan and Mexican sides of the river. In 1879 he made an\r\nalmost complete tour of old Mexico, traveling on horseback or by\r\nbuckboard from the capitol to El Paso del Norte. In July of that year he\r\njoined General Miles’ expedition against the Sioux in Montana, crossed\r\nthe British line and visited the hostile village of Sitting Bull. In\r\nOctober he accompanied General Merritt’s column, operating against the\r\nUte Indians, who had murdered Agent Meeker and killed Major Thornburgh\r\nin Colorado. In 1880 he made a complete tour of the southern states and\r\nlater wrote up the country traversed by the Canadian and Northern\r\nPacific Railroads, then in process of construction.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Colonel Finerty severed his connection with the Chicago daily\r\npress and founded the _Chicago Citizen_, which he edited until his\r\ndeath. He was elected to congress in that year and distinguished himself\r\nin the House by effective speeches in advocacy of the new navy and coast\r\nfortifications bills. In 1884 he supported Mr. Blaine for the\r\npresidency. He was an enthusiastic supporter of Parnell in his struggle\r\nfor Irish autonomy and was twice elected president of the United Irish\r\nLeague of the United States.\r\n\r\nColonel Finerty delivered the Washington oration at the University of\r\nMichigan, Ann Arbor, February 22, 1891, and received an ovation from\r\nboth the faculty and the students. He was also a principal speaker at\r\nthe James G. Blaine and John A. Logan memorial meetings in Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 he published his personal narratives of the Sioux Wars, entitled\r\n“Warpath and Bivouac,” which was favorably received and had a large sale\r\nin the United States, Canada and England. He had another book in course\r\nof preparation at the time of his death. Mr. Finerty was a veteran\r\nlecturer on American, Irish and cosmopolitan subjects. He never used\r\nnotes or manuscript, but having made himself familiar with his subject\r\nrelied upon his memory for words fitting the subject.\r\n\r\nDuring his journalistic career he reported the lectures of Wendell\r\nPhillips, Henry Ward Beecher, Carl Schurz, Edward Everett Hale, Father\r\nTom Burke and many other celebrities, and became convinced that the\r\nspeaker who did not use manuscripts took best with the American people.\r\n\r\nNo one could be intimately acquainted with Colonel Finerty without\r\nbecoming fondly attached to him for his many noble qualities of head and\r\nheart. He was a fascinating conversationalist, a brilliant writer and a\r\ntruly eloquent orator. The great storehouse of his mind unfolded itself\r\nin private conversation with the freshness of the running brook, in his\r\nwritings with the diction and elegance of the classics and in his\r\noratory like a mountain torrent.\r\n\r\nAlthough a firm believer in the Catholic faith himself, every human\r\nbeing who loved justice and liberty and had the courage to avow it he\r\nregarded as his brother, no matter in what creed he saw fit to dedicate\r\nhis thoughts to the Almighty.\r\n\r\nIn the death of John F. Finerty, Ireland has lost as devoted and\r\nself-sacrificing a son as was ever born upon that sacred soil, and the\r\nUnited States has lost as loyal and patriotic a citizen as ever fought\r\neither in the defense or in the assertion of American freedom; and the\r\nfriends of liberty the world over have lost as true and generous an\r\nadvocate of universal freedom as any country has ever produced.\r\n\r\nAt the big John F. Finerty memorial meeting, held in the new Seventh\r\nRegiment Armory, Chicago, in November, 1908, Hon. P. T. Barry presiding,\r\nHon. Bourke Cockran delivered a most eloquent address in which he said\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen_: If there could be the slightest\r\n  doubt in the mind of anyone here as to the effect and power of that\r\n  gift (oratory) which the chairman has described in terms so glowing,\r\n  he himself has illustrated it in the highest degree. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n  “I know of no person who has presented the subject, for which a\r\n  gathering has assembled, in terms so glowing, with an eloquence so\r\n  splendid, with pathos so tender and with a feeling so true and\r\n  sincere. I have come tonight to add the tribute of my admiration, my\r\n  sincere respect and my affection as an Irishman to the memory which we\r\n  have gathered to commemorate and honor. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n  “Listening to the words of your chairman, I feel most deeply that a\r\n  great light has been extinguished which had lit for many thousands and\r\n  hundreds of thousands the pathway of duty and of honor. A mighty oak\r\n  under whose umbrageous shade many had been refreshed on the long,\r\n  trying journey from aspiration to accomplishment, who otherwise would\r\n  have fallen and fallen forever. A watchman, upon the tower of liberty\r\n  had been relieved, who had never slumbered at his post. The earth had\r\n  taken unto her bosom him who had been the embodiment of manly virtue,\r\n  of manly faith and manly courage while he trod her surface—John F.\r\n  Finerty lies in a Chicago cemetery. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n  “This gathering, vast in its numbers and intense in its feeling, is\r\n  the most eloquent tribute to the respect he inspired, to the influence\r\n  he wielded, to the fame he acquired, to the memory that he left. What\r\n  can I say of his life, his achievements, of his personal virtues, to\r\n  you who are his neighbors, the friends before whose edified eyes every\r\n  day of his life was passed?\r\n\r\n  “I know of no life that has been fuller of achievement, more vibrant\r\n  with strenuous effort and which is absolutely without stain, from the\r\n  very hour, when he first raised his voice in behalf of his country to\r\n  the period when he was followed to the grave by a long line of\r\n  mourners who were privileged to assist at his interment. His death was\r\n  mourned by hundreds of thousands of his countrymen whose cause he had\r\n  served, and who had admired his virtues during his life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MEMORIAL TO JEFFREY ROCHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 31, 1909, a beautiful tablet was dedicated to Jeffrey Roche and\r\nthe exercises in connection therewith in Holyhood cemetery, Brookline,\r\nMass., were attended by hundreds who had known and loved the editor,\r\npoet and author. The eloquent eulogy was pronounced by Mr. Joseph Smith,\r\none of the founders of our Society, and a devoted admirer of Mr. Roche.\r\n\r\nThe huge granite memorial was the gift of the John Boyle O’Reilly Club\r\nand bore a bronze plate with the following inscription in Gothic\r\ncapitals:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Beneath This Stone Rests\r\n                          All that is mortal of\r\n                           JAMES JEFFREY ROCHE.\r\n                       Born Mountmellick, Ireland,\r\n                             31st May, 1847.\r\n                       Died at Berne, Switzerland,\r\n                             3d April, 1908,\r\n                           An American Consul.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  A writer—he gave freely of his genius to humanity that the strong\r\n  might be restrained, the weak strengthened and right might reign; a\r\n  poet—patriotism, heroism and justice were the burden of his song; and\r\n  author—his kindly wit and gentle satire were turned on folly and\r\n  hypocrisy; an editor—his pen fought stoutly for the oppressed and\r\n  persecuted of all races and creeds; a man—he never surrendered his\r\n  principles to temptation, keeping his conscience clear and his mind\r\n  free.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  This tablet is erected by his friends, who loved and admired him in\r\n  life and mourn and honor him in death.\r\n\r\n                          MAY HE REST IN PEACE.\r\n                           JAMES JEFFREY ROCHE,\r\n               Born in Mountmellick, Ireland, May 31, 1847.\r\n                Died in Berne, Switzerland, April 3, 1908.\r\n\r\n       Under the skies of that brave mountain land,\r\n         Where Alpine shepherds feudal might defied,\r\n       Where struggling freedom warring cent’ries spanned,\r\n         There in the shadows of the hills he died.\r\n\r\n       The whisp’ring woods to murm’ring rills gave voice,\r\n         The snowy heights caught faint the lowlands’ sighs,\r\n       Dead Pan returned and bade his hosts rejoice,\r\n         For Heav’n is richer when a singer dies.\r\n\r\n       He died as dies some long sweet summer day,\r\n         When fruits are golden on the burdened trees;\r\n       The sun’s pale glory on the sky’s blue gray,\r\n         And night comes fragrant on the cooling breeze.\r\n\r\n       They brought him home and laid him down to rest,\r\n         To sleep forever in his narrow bed,\r\n       Amid the scenes and friends that he loved best,\r\n         At rest forever with his sacred dead.\r\n\r\n       Like the red roses that have bloomed and died,\r\n         Whose withered sweetness scents each hallowed nook,\r\n       Shall the dead singer’s spirit still abide\r\n         To hush dissension and pale hate rebuke.\r\n                                                   —_Joseph Smith._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF COLONEL JAMES D. BRADY.\r\n\r\n (_Through the courtesy of Joseph P. Brady, his son, Clerk of the U. S.\r\n          Circuit Court of the Eastern District of Virginia._)\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel James D. Brady was born at Portsmouth, Virginia, April 3, 1843,\r\nand died at Petersburg, Virginia, November 30, 1900.\r\n\r\nThe death of his father in 1855, his mother having died during his\r\ninfancy, made it necessary for him to leave his home in Virginia when a\r\nboy of eleven years of age, and go to New York City to live with a\r\nkinsman, and he was residing in that city at the time the Civil War\r\nbroke out.\r\n\r\nHe enlisted March 9, 1861, as a private in Company A, 37th New York,\r\n“Irish Rifles.” On December 7, 1861, he was transferred to the 63d New\r\nYork Volunteer Infantry, Meagher’s Irish Brigade, and commissioned its\r\nfirst lieutenant. Very shortly thereafter he was made the adjutant of\r\nthe regiment. He was for gallant and efficient conduct successively\r\npromoted to Captain, Major, Lieutenant-Colonel and Colonel of the\r\nregiment, and as such last named officer was honorably mustered out of\r\nservice May 26, 1865, claiming to be the youngest colonel in the Army of\r\nthe Potomac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COL. JAMES D. BRADY.\r\n\r\n  One of the founders of the Society and the father of Hon. Joseph P.\r\n    Brady of Richmond, Va. Col. Brady deceased in 1900, honored and\r\n    respected by all who knew him.\r\n]\r\n\r\nColonel Brady was at different times Judge Advocate, Adjutant-General\r\nand Inspector General of the First Division of the 2nd Army Corps.\r\n\r\nColonel Brady participated in all of the great battles in which the\r\nIrish Brigade was engaged. He commanded “The Color Company” in the\r\nbattle of Fredericksburg, December 17, 1862, and while leading his\r\ncompany in the assault of the Irish Brigade upon Marye’s Heights on that\r\nday was wounded in the head. General Thomas Francis Meagher specially\r\nmentioned his conduct in that battle in his official report. He was\r\nslightly wounded in the leg in the “second day” battle of Fair Oaks, the\r\nmorning that General Howard lost his arm. He was wounded in the mouth at\r\nMalvern Hill, and again wounded in the arm at Cold Harbor, June 3, 1864,\r\nin which battle he was dangerously wounded in the body. He was\r\npersonally complimented by General Hancock at the battle of\r\nFredericksburg on the afternoon General Zook was mortally wounded,\r\nColonel Brady being with General Zook at the time he was shot.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, Colonel Brady returned to Virginia, and was shortly\r\nthereafter elected Clerk of the Court of his native city. He held that\r\nposition until President Hayes appointed him Collector of Internal\r\nRevenue for the Eastern Division of Virginia, which position he held\r\nunder the administrations of Garfield, Arthur, Harrison and McKinley.\r\n\r\nHe was elected a member of the Forty-ninth Congress from the Fourth\r\nVirginia District, and held many other positions of emolument and trust,\r\nboth under the State and Federal Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   ENTERTAINMENT OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL BY OUR FELLOW MEMBER, HON.\r\n CHARLES ALEXANDER, AT MACEDONIA, HIS SUMMER HOME, IN BARRINGTON, R. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the Executive Council held in Providence, R. I., July 22,\r\n1909, had a pleasant termination. Francis J. Quinlan, M. D., LL. D.,\r\nPresident-General, Michael F. Dooley, Esq., Treasurer-General, Thomas\r\nZanslaur Lee, Secretary-General, Hon. Edward J. McGuire, Hon. Thomas B.\r\nFitzpatrick, Rev. John J. McCoy, D. D., John F. Doyle, Esq., Patrick\r\nCarter, Esq., Patrick F. Magrath, Esq., and Colonel John McManus,\r\nmembers of the Executive Council, assembled at the Society’s\r\nheadquarters and, after considering the business that was brought to\r\ntheir attention, adjourned to accept the very kind invitation of Hon.\r\nCharles Alexander to spend the day with him at Macedonia, his beautiful\r\nsummer home in Barrington, R. I.\r\n\r\nThe circular calling the meeting of the Council and notifying the\r\nmembers of the invitation was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       PROVIDENCE, R. I., July 15, 1909.\r\n\r\n  There will be a meeting of the Executive Council Thursday, July 22d,\r\n  at the summer home of Hon. Charles Alexander in Barrington, Rhode\r\n  Island, who has invited, through Treasurer-General Dooley, the Council\r\n  to partake of his hospitality on that day. As it is necessary that Mr.\r\n  Alexander know just how many of the Council are to be present, will\r\n  you kindly signify immediately on enclosed postal whether or not you\r\n  will be present?\r\n\r\n  The members of the Council will assemble at the office of the\r\n  Secretary-General, seventh floor Industrial Trust Company Building,\r\n  No. 49 Westminster Street, Providence, Rhode Island, at 10.30 a. m.,\r\n  July 22d, 1909, and will be conveyed to Barrington, twelve miles\r\n  distant, by automobiles, passing some of the most beautiful shore\r\n  scenery in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n  Luncheon will be served at twelve o’clock, and a genuine Rhode Island\r\n  clambake will follow at two o’clock. The members will be brought back\r\n  to the city in time to take trains for New York or other distant\r\n  points.\r\n\r\n  The New York members may take the Providence Line Boat if they choose,\r\n  leaving Pier 18, New York City, at 5.30 o’clock p. m., and arriving in\r\n  Providence at 7. a. m. the next morning.\r\n\r\n  As there is much business of importance to be transacted at the\r\n  meeting, it is earnestly requested that you be present.\r\n\r\n                                        Yours respectfully,\r\n                                            THOMAS ZANSLAUR LEE,\r\n                                                    _Secretary-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members and invited guests were conveyed by automobiles through East\r\nProvidence and along the shores of Narragansett Bay to Mr. Alexander’s\r\nhouse, where they arrived in season for luncheon, which was served at\r\none o’clock in the casino adjoining his residence.\r\n\r\nFollowing that the members inspected the beautiful grounds and\r\nbuildings, engaged in the game of bowls on the lawn, examined the\r\nextensive plant for the artificial cultivation of Rhode Island clams,\r\nand spent a delightful time in social intercourse until three p. m.,\r\nwhen a Rhode Island clambake was served, the menu of which was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                 Clam Chowder            Clam Cakes\r\n                     Broiled Scrod a la Alexander\r\n                              Baked Clams\r\n             Baked Sweet Potatoes Rhode Island Johnny Cake\r\n                Baked Lobsters     French Fried Potatoes\r\n                  Watermelon           Indian Pudding\r\n                    Coffee                Cordials\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the dinner Colonel Alexander invited\r\nTreasurer-General Dooley to act as toastmaster, and the latter made a\r\nmost interesting and timely address. Brief addresses were made by\r\nColonel Alexander, President-General Quinlan, Monsignor Doran, Rev. Dr.\r\nMcCoy, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Mr. Lee, Mr. McGuire, Judge Rathbun and Mr.\r\nMagrath.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the Executive Council, not having taken an adjournment,\r\nwas called to order again, and the following gentlemen, upon their\r\napplication, were unanimously elected members of the Society: Hon.\r\nCharles Alexander, Rt. Rev. Mgr. Thomas F. Doran, V. G., LL. D., Hon.\r\nElmer J. Rathbun, Charles B. Humphrey, Esq., and Rev. Owen F. Clarke.\r\n\r\nIt was unanimously voted “that the thanks of the Executive Council be\r\nand they hereby are tendered our most genial host for the splendid\r\ndinner and entertainment that the Executive Council have this day\r\nreceived at his hands.”\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the exercises the members and guests, after bidding\r\nColonel Alexander good-bye and wishing him happiness and prosperity as\r\nlong as he lives, returned to Providence and departed for their\r\nrespective homes.\r\n\r\nTo Treasurer-General Dooley is rightly due the happy suggestion that\r\nbrought about the invitation, and it was entirely through his influence\r\nthat this excellent and dignified entertainment of the Executive Council\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PRESENTATION TO COLONEL ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\nThe local members of the Executive Council, deeply appreciative of the\r\nnature and extent of the entertainment on July 22nd, 1909, decided to\r\nshow their appreciation of Colonel Alexander’s generous hospitality in a\r\nsubstantial manner, and Treasurer-General Dooley caused to be made by\r\nthe Watson & Newell Company of Attleboro, Mass., a punch bowl eleven\r\ninches high, holding two and one-half gallons, the edges of which are\r\nmounted with massive silver ornaments; two large silver shields are\r\nmounted on the bowl, one on the front and one behind. The front one has\r\nthe American and Irish flags crossed, with the American eagle above and\r\na wreath around the outside of the flags and eagle, the wreath being\r\ncomposed of shamrock entwined with stalks of ripened grain. On the\r\nreverse side of the bowl is a large shield with similar wreaths of grain\r\nand shamrock, within which is engraved the following inscription:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Memoria tenere diem ambrosianam apud Macedoniam, Alexandri Maximi\r\n  Domum, Societatis Historicæ Americo-Hibernicæ Sodales hanc crateram\r\n  dedicaverunt die sexta decima julii A.

MDCCCCIX._”\r\n\r\n               “_In poculo pleno nostri non obliviscare._”\r\n\r\n\r\nthe translation of which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “To perpetuate the memory of an ambrosian day at ‘Macedonia,’ the home\r\n  of Alexander the Greatest, the members of the American Irish\r\n  Historical Society have dedicated this bowl, the 16th day of July,\r\n  1909.”\r\n\r\n                “May we be in the flowing cup remembered.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter accompanying the punch bowl when it was delivered to Colonel\r\nAlexander was prepared by Mr. Dooley and is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                      OFFICE OF TREASURER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    PROVIDENCE, R.

MICHAEL F. DOOLEY, THOMAS ZANSLAUR LEE, JOHN MCMANUS, and\r\n     PATRICK CARTER, Local Members of the Executive Council of the\r\n     American Irish Historical Society:—\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_: I am in receipt of your cordial letter of October\r\n  fourteenth and the splendid punch bowl for Macedonia. I heartily thank\r\n  you for them both, and you may be sure that the home of the bowl will\r\n  be Macedonia.\r\n\r\n  It certainly brings to my mind one of the pleasantest days of my life,\r\n  and I truly hope that Father Time will deal gently with us so that at\r\n  no distant date we will all meet again at Macedonia, and with good\r\n  fellowship drink from the bowl to good luck and prosperity for all.\r\n\r\n  Thanking you for the kind remembrance, I remain,\r\n\r\n                                                  Most truly yours,\r\n                                                      CHARLES ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole event from beginning to end was well managed and the gentlemen\r\npresent enjoyed every minute of the time spent at Macedonia. The affair\r\nwas managed by Colonel Alexander and Mr. Dooley, and not a single detail\r\nfor the comfort or pleasure of the Executive Council was omitted. July\r\n22d, 1909, and Macedonia will be long remembered by the members of the\r\nExecutive Council who participated in this most enjoyable occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FORT SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n           BY LIEUT. ERNEST VAN D. MURPHY, FT. SHERIDAN, ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the United States Government, following its traditional policy\r\nin the bestowal of names on its fortifications and the stations of its\r\narmed forces, selected and gave to the new military post recently\r\nestablished on the shores of Lake Michigan, the name of “Fort Sheridan,”\r\nin commemoration of that illustrious Irish-American soldier, General\r\nPhilip H. Sheridan, who had, but a few years previously, died while in\r\nchief command of the army. Placed as it is, on the high bluffs\r\noverlooking the blue waters of our exclusively American Sea, the natural\r\nadvantages of the site combined with the carefully thought out scheme of\r\nconstruction, to say nothing of the care and interest that has been\r\nmanifested by the various commanding officers, who have, since its\r\nfoundation been charged with the carrying out of the designs of the War\r\nDepartment, all combine to make the post, as a whole, a worthy memorial\r\nof its gallant namesake.\r\n\r\nThe French, far back in the colonial period, recognized the importance,\r\nto their schemes of trade and colonization, of the control of the great\r\nnatural channels of communication between the Great Lakes and the\r\nMississippi Valley, and to secure their supremacy established a number\r\nof military posts in northern Illinois—Fort St. Joseph on the eastern\r\nside of Lake Michigan; Fort Crevecœur and Kaskasia among others.\r\nFollowing the French, the British and afterward the American Governments\r\ncontinued the policy of the French and kept up a number of\r\nestablishments whose functions were mainly to provide a measure of\r\ncontrol over the Indian inhabitants. Fort Dearborn, on the present site\r\nof the City of Chicago, was built in 1804 and was kept up until the\r\nsettling of the country and the consequent removal west of the\r\naborigines made its further maintenance unnecessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  STEPHEN FARRELLY, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  Of New York City.\r\n\r\n  A Life Member of the Society, and a Member of the Executive Council.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese early posts in the northwest were, as a rule, mere stockades, with\r\nsuch block-houses and angles let into the trace as were necessary to\r\nprevent dead spaces and command the ditch. They provided shelter from\r\nthe rifle fire of that day but were of little value against artillery.\r\nSo today, Fort Sheridan, the successor of Fort Dearborn, is not, from a\r\nmilitary standpoint, a place of even temporary defense, much less a\r\nstronghold. The control of the natural and artificial ways of\r\ncommunication between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi, is dependent\r\nnow, as a century ago, not on heavy ordnance and great fortifications,\r\nnor on our naval strength on the lakes, for unfortunately we have\r\nnone—but depends directly upon such forces of the mobile army as the\r\ngovernment may have available at a crisis. Thus it may be seen that Fort\r\nSheridan, as one of the largest stations of the regular army, plays an\r\nimportant part in the subject of the strategical defenses of our\r\nnorthern frontier. Its central location, with the unparalleled railroad\r\nfacilities of Chicago at hand; the water routes of the lakes and the\r\nexcellent road system of the northern-central states permit the garrison\r\nto be moved rapidly and surely to the points at which its presence, in\r\ntime of national need may be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe reservation consists of about 700 acres of grass and woodland,\r\nnearly level and but very little cut up ravines. Not being handicapped\r\nby the presence of old structures, the barracks, quarters and other\r\nbuildings built when the post was started present a handsome appearance.\r\nThey represent the most approved methods of construction of their time\r\nand through their simplicity of design and large details they permit of\r\nready and economical maintenance and bid fair to endure for years.\r\nDuring the summer months, from April to November, and in the winter when\r\nweather conditions are favorable the garrison, a regiment of Infantry, a\r\nsquadron of cavalry, a battalion of Field Artillery, and such details of\r\nthe special arms, the Signal Corps, Hospital Corps, etc., is busy\r\ncarrying on its training for active service or in providing for its own\r\nimmediate necessities. For it must be understood the government’s\r\nimmense plant,—two hundred and odd buildings, five hundred horses and\r\nmules, the grounds and the valuable machinery of war must be cared for\r\nby the ones who use them. Thus it is that the soldier not only does his\r\nown cooking and general housekeeping but works for the general good of\r\nthe little city in which he lives; grooming horses, driving teams,\r\nhauling supplies, or if his capabilities lie in that direction working\r\nas carpenter or mason on the buildings of the post. His housekeeping and\r\nother work, that in civil life is usually looked out for by his mother\r\nor wife, he must, in the army, do to live, after that comes the training\r\nin the fighting arts which finally decide wars. The military year is\r\ndivided into two seasons, the season of practical work, carried out in\r\nthe open, and the season of theoretical work, carried on indoors and\r\noutside as circumstances permit. The theoretical training is carried on\r\nusually in the winter but as a matter of fact there is some overlapping.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant summer weather brings thousands of the residents of Chicago\r\nto the post. Lunch basket in hand, they make a peaceful invasion and\r\nforget the heat, smoke and soot of their city surroundings as they\r\nwander through the clean grass and shady groves. Then, too, the training\r\nof the soldier, be he of the cavalry, the “eyes of the service”; the\r\nartillery with its scientific leanings; or of the “walk-a-heaps,” as the\r\nIndians call the infantry—the backbone of all armies; all present much\r\nof interest to the civilian, who, unless he visits their stations rarely\r\nsees the regular soldier, save, perhaps as he marches by in some\r\ncelebration of national importance, or toils, in heavy marching order\r\nthrough the country districts carrying out some manœuvre problem.\r\n\r\nThus it may be seen that the American people, through their\r\nrepresentatives, have, in Fort Sheridan, erected and maintained, to the\r\nmemory of their gallant general, not a cold, dead memorial of stone, but\r\na living, vital monument, a link in the defenses of the nation, and have\r\nplaced it where his deeds and the work going on under the shadow of his\r\nname, serve as an inspiration to the patriotism of the youth of our\r\nsecond city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE IRISH ELEMENT IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n              BY MR. R. C. O’CONNOR OF SAN FRANCISCO, CAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish people have been coming to this country from the time of its\r\nearliest settlement. Many came involuntarily, having been deported\r\nhither by order of the Cromwell Government, and some historians assert\r\nthat during the ten years succeeding the close of the Cromwellian war,\r\nin 1652, a hundred thousand young men and young women were shipped to\r\nthe West Indies and to the colonies. Voluntary emigration, however, had\r\nnot begun to any great extent before the opening of the 18th century. We\r\nhave historical evidence, however, in support of the statement that the\r\nIrish came with the earliest settlers of the colonies.\r\n\r\nReverend William Elliott Griffis in his work, “Brave Little Holland and\r\nWhat She Taught Us,” says on page 208: “In the ‘Mayflower’ ... were one\r\nhundred and one men, women, boys and girls, as passengers, besides\r\ncaptain and crew. These were of English, Dutch, French and Irish\r\nancestry and thus typical of our national stock.” We know from Hatten’s\r\n“Original Lists,” and other authorities, that Irish immigration to\r\nVirginia was in progress as far back as 1634–35. And Felt’s\r\n“Ecclesiastical History of New England” says that William Collins led a\r\nnumber of Irish refugees to Connecticut from the West Indies about the\r\nyear 1640. Previous to the beginning of the 18th century Irish emigrants\r\nturned their faces towards Europe, where the young men entered the\r\narmies with the hope of some day returning to achieve the independence\r\nof their country. An idea can be formed of the extent of this emigration\r\nfrom a statement made by the Abbe Macgeoghan, who was chaplain to the\r\nIrish Brigade in France, who says that “the records of the War Office of\r\nFrance show that during the fifty years preceding the battle of\r\nFontenoy, in 1745, over 450,000 Irishmen entered the service of that\r\ncountry alone.” When peace with England was declared in 1748 the Irish\r\nfound, much to their disgust and contrary to their hopes and to the\r\npromises held out to them, that France had left them out of her\r\nreckoning and that their blood so lavishly shed for that country had\r\nbeen shed in vain, as far as any advantage to their native land was\r\nconcerned. After that time the Irish ceased to emigrate to Europe to any\r\ngreat extent, and turned their faces to the great West, then opening up\r\nbefore the world, and since that time, now two hundred years ago, they\r\nhave been coming in a steady stream to this country.\r\n\r\nNo statistics of the nationality of immigrants were kept by this\r\nGovernment until 1820, and we are kept in more or less doubt as to the\r\nexact number of our people who came here previous to that time. We have,\r\nhowever, historical evidence that this number was very large. Wilson in\r\nhis “History of the American People,” speaking of the early years of the\r\n18th century, says: “For several years after the first quarter of the\r\nnew century had run out (that is, after 1725) immigration from the North\r\nof Ireland came crowding in twelve thousand strong to the year. In 1729\r\nquite 5,000 of them entered Pennsylvania alone. From Pennsylvania they\r\npassed along the broad, inviting valley, southward, into the western\r\npart of Virginia.” Thomas Bond, British Consul at Philadelphia from 1787\r\nto 1812, who is described as the most efficient of the British officials\r\nof the United States, writing to the Duke of Leeds, head of the English\r\nForeign Office, in 1789, says: “The immigrants hither since the peace,\r\nmy lord, that is since the conclusion of the war in 1783, have been much\r\ngreater from Ireland than from all other parts of Europe. Of 25,716\r\npassengers, redemptioners and servants imported since the peace into\r\nPennsylvania, 1,893 only were Germans; the rest consisted of Irish and a\r\nvery few Scotch. Of 2,167 already imported in the present year, 114 only\r\nwere Germans; the rest were Irish.... I have not yet been able to obtain\r\nany account of the number of Irish passengers brought hither for any\r\ngiven series of years before the war, but from my own recollection I\r\nknow the number was very great, and I have been told that in one year\r\n6,000 landed at Philadelphia, Wilmington and Newcastle upon Delaware.”\r\n\r\nRamsay, the historian, writing in this same year (1789) says: “The\r\ncolonies, which now form the United States, may be considered as Europe\r\ntransplanted. Ireland, England, France, Germany, Holland, Switzerland,\r\nSweden, Poland and Italy furnished the original stock of the population,\r\nand have been supposed to contribute to it in the order named. _For the\r\nlast seventy or eighty years no nation has contributed so much to the\r\npopulation of America as Ireland._” [The emphasis is mine.]\r\n\r\nThis is significant and valuable testimony to our numbers in the years\r\npreceding the Revolution, and justifies the statements that have been\r\nmade that the Irish element formed one-third of the population at the\r\nclose of the colonial period. Doctor Lynch, Bishop of Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, says: “The Irish immigration almost took possession of the\r\nState. Irish family names abound in every rank and condition of life,\r\nand there are few natives of the State in whose veins there does not run\r\nmore or less Irish blood.”\r\n\r\nSims’ “Life of General Marion” says: “The people of Williamsburg were\r\nsprung generally from Irish parentage. They inherited in common with all\r\nthe descendants of the Irish in America a hearty detestation of the\r\nEnglish name and authority. This feeling rendered them excellent\r\npatriots and daring soldiers wherever the British lion was the object of\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\n“The most numerous name in the First Census of South Carolina is Murphy,\r\nthere having been fifty distinct families of that name, although the\r\nforty-eight Kelly families gave them a close race. The Gill and McGill\r\nfamilies run nip and tuck with the O’Neills and Nealls; there were\r\nthirty-four of the former to thirty-three of the latter. The O’Briens\r\nand O’Bryans ran the gauntlet of many changes. The Census enumerators\r\nfailed to appreciate the significance of the regal prefix ‘O,’ so they\r\nwrote the name Obrient, Obriant, Bryan and Briant. There were\r\nfifty-three of these in South Carolina in 1790. The Celtic ‘Macs’ make a\r\ngreat showing. There are upwards of 1,000 of such families in all. When\r\nwe consider that in 1790 the total number of free white males of 16\r\nyears of age and upward in South Carolina was only 35,766 we can readily\r\nunderstand that one thousand heads of families, with their wives and\r\nchildren, must have constituted a large percentage of the population.\r\nAmong the ‘Macs’ are McCarts, McCarthys, McMahon, McClures, McMullens,\r\nMcNeils, etc. Then there are forty-one distinct families of Bradleys,\r\ntwenty-four Sullivans, twenty-eight Reynolds, twenty-three Connors and\r\nO’Connors, twenty-one Carrolls, etc.” (I have taken the foregoing from a\r\nvery instructive article by Michael J. O’Brien in Vol. 8 of “The Journal\r\nof the American Irish Historical Society.”) The names are interesting as\r\nshowing that the emigrants from Ireland to the colonies during the 18th\r\ncentury were not all from the North of Ireland, as is generally\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nBut the Irish were even more distinguished, if not more numerous, in\r\nVirginia than in South Carolina. I will mention only a single family,\r\nthat of John Preston, who was born in Ireland and came to Virginia in\r\n1735. Dr. R. A. Brock in his “Virginia and Virginians” says: “Scarce\r\nanother American family has numbered as many prominent and honored\r\nrepresentatives as that of the yeoman founded Preston, with its\r\ncollateral lines and alliances. It has furnished the national Government\r\na Vice-President (Hon. John Cabell Breckenridge); has been represented\r\nin several of the executive departments and in both branches of\r\nCongress. It has given Virginia five governors—McDowell, Campbell,\r\nPreston and the two Floyds—and to Kentucky, Missouri and California, one\r\neach, in Governors Jacobs, B. Gratz Brown and Miller; Thomas Hart\r\nBenton, John J. Crittenden, William C. and William Ballard Preston,\r\nleading molders of public sentiment; the Breckenridges, Dr. Robert J.\r\nand William L., distinguished theologians of Kentucky; Professors\r\nHolmes, Venable and Cabell of the University of Virginia, besides other\r\ndistinguished educators.” To this family also belonged Generals Wade\r\nHampton, Albert Sydney Johnston, Joseph E. Johnston, John B. Floyd, John\r\nC. Breckenridge and John S. and William C. Preston.\r\n\r\nThe families of Charles Carroll of Maryland and John Sullivan of\r\nMassachusetts, with their collateral branches, became as distinguished,\r\nif not as numerous, as the Preston family.\r\n\r\nI cannot dismiss this part of my subject without mentioning one other\r\ndistinguished Irish immigrant, the renowned Dean of Derry, known later\r\nas Bishop Berkeley, the friend of Swift and the founder of the school of\r\nphilosophy which bears his name. He was a native of Kilkenny. He came to\r\nAmerica to found a college for the conversion and education of Indians.\r\nBefore he returned to Ireland he gave his private library to Yale\r\nCollege, the most magnificent collection of books that had been brought\r\nto America down to that day. Our University Town across the Bay is named\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nLet me now call attention briefly to the part which the Irish element\r\nplayed in the Revolution. Did they ally themselves with the patriots of\r\nthe day and were their services in any degree commensurate with their\r\nnumbers and their wealth? In regard to the numbers of Irish in the\r\nRevolutionary army, the following testimony should be considered\r\nconclusive:\r\n\r\nIn the British House of Commons’ report, fifth session, fourteenth\r\nParliament, Vol. 13, page 303, the following report of an investigation\r\nof the causes of the defeat in the war with the colonies will be found.\r\nThe investigation was held in 1779. Major General Robertson, who had\r\nserved twenty-four years in America, was asked: “How are the Provincial\r\nCorps composed, mostly from native Americans or from emigrants from\r\nvarious nations from Europe?” He answered: “Some of the corps mostly of\r\nnatives; others, I believe the greatest number, are enlisted from such\r\npeople as can be got in the country and many of them may be emigrants. I\r\nremember General Lee telling me he believed half the rebel army were\r\nfrom Ireland.” In Vol. 13, British Commons’ Reports, page 431, Joseph\r\nGalloway, a native of Pennsylvania, speaker of the Assembly of the\r\nColony for twelve years and a delegate to the first Continental\r\nCongress, who became a violent Tory in 1773, was examined for several\r\ndays by members of the House of Commons. Among the questions asked was:\r\n“That part of the rebel army that enlisted in the service of Congress,\r\nwere they chiefly composed of natives of America, or were the greater\r\npart of them English, Scotch, or Irish?” Galloway answered: “The names\r\nand places of their nativity being taken down I can answer the question\r\nwith precision. There were scarcely one-fourth natives of America,\r\n_one-half Irish_, the other one-fourth English and Scotch.” So much for\r\nthe rank and file.\r\n\r\nAmong those who distinguished themselves during the Revolution were:\r\nGeneral John Sullivan, the son of an Irish teacher; O’Brien, who, with\r\nhis sons, won the first naval battle of the Revolution, known as the\r\n“Lexington of the seas”; Montgomery, who, after capturing Fort St. John\r\nand Montreal, was killed at Quebec; General Knox, commander of the\r\nartillery in the American army, and who commanded the American troops\r\nwhen they marched into New York after the evacuation of the British;\r\nGeneral Reed, Major General Stark, the hero of Bennington, General\r\nWalter Stewart, who was a colonel in the American army before he was 21;\r\nJohn Barry, “Father of the American Navy”; General Anthony Wayne,\r\nGeneral George Clinton, General Stephen Moylan, General John Fitzgerald,\r\nGeneral William Irvine, General Richard Butler, Generals Campbell,\r\nCochran, McDowell, McCall, McCreary, Jasper, Graham, Pickens and many\r\nothers. It has been officially ascertained that out of 131 of the most\r\nprominent officers in the war for American Independence twenty were of\r\nEnglish ancestry, twenty-five of French, ten of German and Dutch, eight\r\nof Scotch, two of Polish, and eighty-four of Irish and Welsh.\r\n\r\nBut the Irish were not less conspicuous in commercial and industrial\r\nlife during the Colonial period, and the assistance which they gave to\r\nWashington and his army during the darkest days of the long struggle for\r\nindependence contributed materially to his final success. In 1780, when\r\nthe finances of the nation were at their lowest ebb, when the patriot\r\narmy encamped at Valley Forge had neither sufficient food nor clothing,\r\nwhen discontent among the troops, in consequence, almost bordered on\r\nmutiny, when Congress importuned by Washington was unable to comply with\r\nhis repeated demands for supplies, the business men of Philadelphia\r\nraised 315,000 pounds sterling and gave it to Congress. Of this amount\r\nthe “Friendly Sons of St. Patrick” contributed £103,000. This timely\r\ncontribution saved the national cause from disaster.\r\n\r\nAmong the signers of the Declaration of Independence of Irish birth or\r\nblood were John Hancock, descended from a County Down family; James\r\nSmith, George Taylor, George Read, Thomas McKean, William Whipple,\r\nEdward Rutledge, Charles Carroll, Matthew Thornton, born in Ireland;\r\nThomas Nelson, Thomas Lynch, Robert Treat Paine, whose real name was\r\nO’Neill, but his father, to save an estate, changed his name from\r\nO’Neill to Paine, his mother’s family name. Thomas Nelson was also\r\ndescended from the O’Neills of Ulster. He succeeded Jefferson as\r\nGovernor of Virginia, and commanded the State’s troops during\r\nLafayette’s campaign against Cornwallis, down to the surrender of\r\nYorktown.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that the Irish element contributed\r\ntheir full share to the building of the nation, pledging their lives and\r\ntheir fortunes to the cause of liberty, standing faithfully by\r\nWashington in every crisis of the prolonged struggle until the\r\npromulgation of the Declaration of Independence heralded the birth of a\r\nnew nation, which was sealed and confirmed by the glory of Yorktown.\r\n\r\nAfter the independence of the country had been established the Irish\r\nstill continued to come in ever increasing numbers. It was not, however,\r\nuntil the great famine of 1846–1848 that the Irish began to come to this\r\ncountry in large numbers. That fearful calamity, that within two years\r\nsent into famine graves over 1,250,000 of the population of Ireland,\r\nsent millions to seek a home in foreign countries. The great bulk of the\r\nemigration came to this country, and even of those who emigrated to\r\nCanada and other countries thousands subsequently found their way into\r\nthe United States. Between the years 1821 and 1890 Ireland gave\r\n3,781,253 emigrants to the United States, a number greater than the\r\nentire population of this country at the time of the Revolution. Ireland\r\ncontributed more than two-fifths of all immigrants from 1821 to 1850,\r\nmore than one-third from 1851 to 1860, and very nearly one-fifth from\r\n1861 to 1870. From 1891 to 1900 it gave but little more than one-tenth.\r\nThe wonder is that after the fearful drain of the previous half century\r\nany were left. So much for the original stock. Of the children born of\r\nforeign parents, according to the census of 1900, 4,981,047 were born of\r\nIrish fathers, and those born of Irish mothers, with fathers of other\r\nnationalities, numbered 236,627. The census of 1900 shows that Irishmen\r\nand their descendants in the first degree in that year numbered nearly\r\n7,000,000 in round numbers. When you consider the figures which I have\r\ngiven, taken from the most reliable sources, is it an exaggeration to\r\nassert, as some do, that one-third of the population of the country is\r\nof Irish descent, especially when the fecundity of the race, which is\r\nnot excelled by that of any other people, is taken into account. To\r\nwrite the history, therefore, of the Irish element in the United States\r\nis to write the history of the country. When we add to the Irish element\r\nthe German element, which for the past twenty-five years has largely\r\noutnumbered the Irish, is it not amusing to hear certain Anglo-maniacs\r\nspeak of this country as “Anglo-Saxon?”\r\n\r\nThe part which the Irish immigrants played in the war of 1812 and in the\r\nwar of the rebellion was not less conspicuous than that which their\r\ncountrymen played in the Revolution. They gave to the Union cause an\r\narmy greater by many thousands than that by which Wellington defeated\r\nNapoleon at Waterloo. Let me quote but two instances from many that\r\ncould be given in which men of Irish blood rendered conspicuous services\r\nto the country.\r\n\r\nFor more than two years after the commencement of the rebellion the war\r\nwas confined almost entirely to the Southern States. Soon after the\r\nopening of the campaign in 1863 Lee conceived the idea that he would\r\nchange the theater of war by marching into Pennsylvania, defeat the\r\nUnion army opposed to him, capture Washington and thus, perhaps, end the\r\nwar and make secession an accomplished fact. The plan was cleverly\r\nthought out and to a man of Lee’s unquestioned military genius did not\r\nseem impossible of accomplishment. He therefore proceeded to put his\r\nplan into execution. With a force of 61,000 men he attacked Hooker, with\r\nan army of 105,000 men, at Chancellorsville and defeated him. Lincoln\r\nwas in despair and preparations were made to evacuate Washington. Lee\r\nled his victorious army through the valley of Virginia, crossed the\r\nPotomac and entered Pennsylvania. The army of the Potomac retreated\r\nbefore him, keeping between the Confederates and the National Capital.\r\nOn June 28 a new commander was given to the National army, Hooker was\r\nremoved and General George G. Meade was appointed to succeed him. Meade\r\nwas the grandson of George Meade, who was one of the founders of “The\r\nFriendly Sons of St. Patrick” in Philadelphia, twenty-seven of whom\r\ncontributed £103,000 to Congress, to which I have already alluded. Three\r\ndays after the armies came together again. On July 1, 1863, Lee attacked\r\nthe Union forces on the heights of Gettysburg. For three days the awful\r\nconflict raged, each side knowing full well what the consequences of\r\nvictory or defeat would be. After a battle almost unparalleled in human\r\nwarfare, the army which Lee had whipped at Chancellorsville whipped him\r\nat Gettysburg, broke the back of the Confederacy, saved the National\r\nCapital and compelled Lee to recross the Potomac. Thus the descendant of\r\nan Irish emigrant saved the Nation from disaster, perhaps from\r\ndismemberment.\r\n\r\nOnce more, in 1864, Lee, hard pressed by the army under Grant, tried to\r\ncreate a diversion in favor of his army by sending General Jubal Early,\r\nthe ablest of his cavalry generals, to surprise the national forces in\r\ncamp at Cedar Creek, advance to the National Capital and thus compel the\r\nwithdrawal of Grant’s army for the defense of Washington. With great\r\nquickness and secrecy he marched up the Shenandoah Valley, and on the\r\nmorning of October 19th, under cover of a thick fog, which concealed his\r\napproach, he suddenly attacked the Union forces. Completely surprised,\r\nthey hastily retreated and a great disaster threatened the army. The\r\nEighth Corps was rolled up, the center gave way and soon the whole army\r\nwas in rapid retreat. Sheridan had been in Washington, and was then in\r\nWinchester, twenty miles away, on his way to join his army, when he\r\nheard the firing. Rapidly riding toward the conflict, he found his army\r\nretreating in confusion. Raising his hat he shouted to his men, who were\r\npanic-stricken: “Face the other way, boys, face the other way; we are\r\ngoing back.” “Who is that?” a soldier asked of his comrade, for Sheridan\r\nis scarcely recognizable through the dust on his clothes and the foam on\r\nhis black steed from hard riding. But there was no mistaking the manner\r\nof the man, and after closely scrutinizing the flying horseman, the\r\ncomrade replies, “Little Phil, by G—!” and in his enthusiasm shouted,\r\n“Hurrah for Sheridan.” The enthusiasm spread, along the whole retreating\r\nline the shout went up, again and again repeated, and men who were\r\nflying in panic before the victorious army of Early, inspired with full\r\nconfidence in that leader who had never lost a battle, reformed their\r\nlines and long before the close of that eventful day Sheridan was able\r\nto telegraph to Washington this characteristic despatch: “We have met\r\nthe enemy under Early and have sent him whirling up the valley.”\r\n\r\nThus a second time was the National Capital saved by the genius and dash\r\nof the son of an Irishman.\r\n\r\nGrant paid Sheridan the compliment of saying that he was the only man\r\nwhich the war developed capable of commanding a hundred thousand men\r\nunder his own eye.\r\n\r\nBut it is not as soldiers alone that the Irish have won distinction;\r\nthey have been conspicuous in every walk of life, in every department of\r\nhuman activity. They have filled with distinction the highest office in\r\nthe gift of the American people, in giving to the Presidency such men as\r\nAndrew Jackson, who was the son of an Irish farmer; James Buchanan, the\r\nson of an Irish emigrant; James K. Polk, the grandson of Irish parents;\r\nChester A. Arthur, the son of an Irish Episcopal clergyman; William\r\nMcKinley, whose granduncle was executed by the British Government for\r\nparticipation in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Claims of Irish descent\r\nhave also been made for Taylor, Johnson and Cleveland (see “The Puritan\r\nin Holland, England and America,” Vol. 2, p. 493). In the long roll of\r\ndistinguished names of the Senate and House of Representatives none\r\nstand higher for eloquence and statesmanship than those who trace their\r\nancestry to Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn journalism men of Irish blood have been among the leaders of those\r\nwho have moulded public opinion. Hugh Gaine, a native of Ireland, began\r\nthe publication of the “Mercury” in 1752; Matthew Lyon, of Vermont, a\r\nnative of Wicklow, started the “Farmers’ Library” and later the\r\n“Fairhaven Gazette.” He was known as a “peppery, red-headed Irishman.”\r\nHe was indicted by the United States Court for an article reflecting on\r\nPresident John Adams, and was fined $1,000 and imprisoned for three\r\nmonths. One of the most interesting characters in the early history of\r\njournalism in this country was John Burk, a native of Ireland, who\r\npublished “The Time Piece” in New York. John Dunlap, a native of\r\nStrabane, was the first Congressional printer. I can only give the names\r\nof a few of those who were prominent as publishers during colonial times\r\nand in the early days of the Republic. John Binn, William B. Kenny,\r\nproprietor of the “New Jersey State Gazette,” the first daily paper in\r\nthat State; Henry O’Reilly, editor of the “Patriot” and later of the\r\n“Rochester Daily Advertiser,” the first daily paper between the Hudson\r\nRiver and the Pacific Ocean. We have Fitz James O’Brien, Col. James\r\nMulligan, Thomas Francis Meagher, soldier, orator and writer; Robert S.\r\nMcKenzie, Thomas Kinsella of the “Brooklyn Eagle.” James Gordon Bennett,\r\nScotch by birth, was the son of an Irish mother. The roster of employees\r\non the staff of the “Herald” during his life reads like the roll call of\r\na Fenian regiment. Horace Greeley, one of the greatest of newspapermen,\r\nwas the son of Irish parents. He made the “Tribune” the most influential\r\npaper in the United States during the war, and for ten years thereafter\r\nwas a power in National politics. I cannot close this brief mention of\r\nIrishmen in journalism without naming one whose writings stirred not\r\nonly America but all Europe, J. A. MacGahan. He was largely instrumental\r\nin bringing about the Bulgarian war of 1875, which changed the geography\r\nof Europe. John Boyle O’Reilly, of the “Boston Pilot,” exercised a wide\r\ninfluence by his writings, as did also his successor, James Jeffrey\r\nRoche. Patrick Forde, of the “Irish World,” has been a power in\r\njournalism for more than a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to call attention to the part which the Irish have\r\nplayed in the ecclesiastical history of this country. We need only look\r\naround us to see what they are doing today. From the Prince of the\r\nChurch, Cardinal Gibbons, down through a long line of illustrious\r\nArchbishops and Bishops, to the latest arrival from Carlow or All\r\nHallows, all zealous workers in the vineyard of the Lord. And what a\r\nharvest they have gleaned! And what the Irish are doing today they have\r\nbeen doing from the beginning—zealous, eloquent, self-sacrificing,\r\nuntiring in the discharge of their duty, giving ungrudgingly to God’s\r\nservice the best that is in them.\r\n\r\nWe have no reason to hang our heads at the part which our people have\r\nplayed in the history of the United States. No element that enters into\r\nthe cosmopolitan population of this country has contributed more in\r\nevery quality that goes to make a great people than the Irish. We have\r\ngiven eloquence to the bar, dignity to the bench, learning and virtue to\r\nthe pulpit, wisdom to the Senate, and glory to the sword. We were\r\npresent at the birth of the Nation and sustained its infantile arms\r\nduring the years of its struggle for liberty, sharing in the hardships\r\nof Valley Forge and in the glory of Yorktown. We fought with Jackson at\r\nNew Orleans and with Perry in Lake Erie; stormed Chapultepec with\r\nShields, rode from Winchester down the valley of Shenandoah with\r\nSheridan; stormed Marye’s Heights with Meagher and his brigade, and\r\nlater climbed the heights of San Juan with Buckey O’Neill and “Rafferty\r\nof ‘F’.” On every field the Irish marched to the battle-front side by\r\nside with the Puritan from New England, the Knickerbocker from New York,\r\nand the liberty-loving dweller of the rolling prairies of Iowa and\r\nIllinois. In the same deep grave they sleep “the silent sleep that knows\r\nno waking.” The snows of winter, like a winding sheet, lie coldly above\r\nthem, and as each returning spring awakens into life and beauty the\r\nsleeping forces of nature, the green grass grows and the wild flowers\r\nbloom above their common grave.\r\n\r\nI will close by quoting the following tributes to the Irish by men who\r\nwere not of our race: Col. John Parke Custis, the adopted son of\r\nWashington, says: “Then honored be the old and good services of the sons\r\nof Erin in the war of Independence. Let the shamrock be entwined with\r\nthe laurels of the Revolution; and truth and justice, guiding the pen of\r\nhistory, inscribe on the tablets of American remembrance: ‘Eternal\r\ngratitude to Irishmen.’”\r\n\r\nSimilar sentiments were expressed by the late Senator Bayard, in the\r\nSenate of the United States. “If,” said he, “the names of the men of\r\nIrish birth and of Irish blood who have dignified and decorated the\r\nannals of American history were to be erased from the record, how much\r\nof the glory of our country would be subtracted? In the list of American\r\nstatesmen and patriots, theologians and poets, soldiers and sailors,\r\npriests and orators, what names shine with purer lustre or are mentioned\r\nwith more respect than those of the men, past and present, we owe to\r\nIreland. On that imperishable roll of honor, the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, we find their names, and in the prolonged struggle that\r\nfollowed there was no battlefield from the St. Lawrence to the Savannah\r\nbut was enriched with Irish blood shed in the cause of civil and\r\nreligious liberty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REMINISCENCES OF AUGUSTUS SAINT-GAUDENS, ONE OF THE FIRST MEMBERS OF\r\n   THE SOCIETY, EDITED BY HIS SON, HOMER SAINT-GAUDENS, AND PUBLISHED\r\n             THROUGH THE COURTESY OF THE CENTURY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father began his reminiscences in the early spring of 1906, while\r\nrecovering from a surgical operation in the Corey Hill Hospital of\r\nBrookline, Massachusetts. As he had spent a most active life, he chafed\r\nat that confinement until this scheme was devised to pass his hours;\r\nwhereupon, to his great amusement, he dictated the first quarter of the\r\nwork. Later, after his return to Windsor, when, to his bitter\r\ndisappointment, he found that he could not for any length of time remain\r\non his feet to model, he continued to write at odd moments up to the\r\nmiddle of the summer.\r\n\r\nThe contents of my father’s text itself I have left intact, save where\r\nexceptionally rough; but the order of thought and anecdote, which was\r\nbadly tangled, owing to the lack of revision, I have shifted back and\r\nforth into a semblance of methodical progression.\r\n\r\nMy father begins:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Reminiscences are more likely to be tiresome than otherwise to the\r\n  readers of later generations; but among the consoling pleasures that\r\n  appear over the horizon as years advance is that of rambling away\r\n  about one’s past....\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “I was born March 1, 1848, in Dublin, Ireland, near 37 Charlemount\r\n  Street. If that is not the house, no doubt the record in the nearest\r\n  Catholic church would give the number.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMy uncle, Mr. Louis Saint-Gaudens, who visited Dublin in the summer of\r\n1890, found the building at number 35, near the head of Charlemount\r\nStreet and not far from a bridge built over the canal which runs by the\r\nsoutheastern part of the city. There, under the trees that line the\r\nbanks and in sight of the Wicklow Hills, my father as a baby must have\r\nbeen carried by my grandmother.\r\n\r\nThe reminiscences continue:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “My mother’s maiden name was Mary McGuiness. Of her ancestry I know\r\n  nothing except that her mother was married twice, the second time to a\r\n  veteran of the Napoleonic wars.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father’s maternal grandmother’s name was Daly. She married Arthur\r\nMcGuiness, of whom it is only recalled that he worked in the Dublin\r\nplaster mills and that he was a Freemason. Neither of the couple lived\r\nto be old. Their daughter Mary McGuiness was born to them at Bally\r\nMahon, County Longford.\r\n\r\nTo return to the autobiography:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Of my mother’s family the only member of which I have had a glimpse\r\n  was her brother George McGuiness, whom I saw in Forsyth Street. I have\r\n  a daguerreotype of his delightfully kind and extremely homely face—a\r\n  face like a benediction, as I have heard some one describe it. He, of\r\n  all men, became the owner of two slaves in the South, and, judging\r\n  from a daguerreotype, married an equally homely and kindly-looking\r\n  woman. He was in some way connected with the navy yard at Pensacola.\r\n  The war cut off all further communication with him.\r\n\r\n  “Of my father’s birth and ancestry I am as ignorant as of my mother’s,\r\n  knowing only that his father was a soldier under Napoleon, who died\r\n  comparatively young and suddenly after what I suspect was a gorgeous\r\n  spree.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father’s paternal grandfather was called André Saint-Gaudens. His\r\nwife’s maiden name was Boy. Tradition has it that she sold butter and\r\neggs in the market-place at Aspet, and that she became a miser, leaving\r\nunder her bed upon her death the conventional box crammed with gold\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThe reminiscences continue:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “My father’s full name was Bernard Paul Ernest Saint-Gaudens; Bernard\r\n  Paul ‘Honeste,’ if you please, he called it later in life; it sounded\r\n  nicer. He was born in the little village of Aspet, about fifty miles\r\n  from Toulouse, at the foot of the Pyrenees, five miles south of the\r\n  town of Saint-Gaudens, in the arrondissement of Saint-Gaudens, in the\r\n  department of the Haute-Garonne, a most beautiful country, as the many\r\n  searchers for health at the baths of Bagnères-de-Luchon know.”...\r\n\r\n\r\nThree years my grandfather passed in London and, later, seven years in\r\nDublin before he met his future wife in the shoe store for which he made\r\nshoes and where she did the binding of slippers. There, previous to my\r\nfather’s birth, two sons, George and Louis, died, George at the age of\r\nsix, and Louis in infancy. But when my father was six months old,\r\n“red-headed, whopper-jawed, and hopeful,” as he would repeat, the famine\r\nin Ireland compelled his parents to go with him to America, setting out\r\nfrom Liverpool, England, in the sailing-ship _Desdemona_.\r\n\r\nThe autobiography goes on:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Father told me that an overcrowded passenger-list prevented his\r\n  leaving Dublin with my mother, with me at her breast, in a ship named\r\n  the _Star of the West_ that burned at sea during the trip. But because\r\n  he told me this does not mean that it was so. His Gascon imagination\r\n  could give character or make beauty wherever these qualities were\r\n  necessary to add interest to what he was saying.\r\n\r\n  “They landed at Boston town probably in September, 1848, he a short,\r\n  stocky, bullet-headed, enthusiastic young man of about thirty, with\r\n  dark hair cf reddish tendencies and a light red mustache, she of his\r\n  height, with the typical long, generous, loving Irish face, with wavy\r\n  black hair, a few years his junior, and ‘the most beautiful girl in\r\n  the world,’ as he used to say.\r\n\r\n  “Leaving mother in Boston,—where, by the way, I am beginning this\r\n  account in the hospital fifty-six years afterward,—he started to find\r\n  work in New York. In six weeks he sent for her. He said we first lived\r\n  in Duane Street. Of this I knew nothing.\r\n\r\n  “From there we went to a house on the west side of Forsyth Street,\r\n  probably near Houston Street, where now is the bronze foundry in which\r\n  the statue of Peter Cooper which I modeled was cast forty-five years\r\n  later. There my brother Andrew was born on Hallowe’en in 1850 or 1851,\r\n  and there I made the beginning of my conscious life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRANCIS I. McCANNA, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n  of Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\n  A Valued Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “The beginnings of my father’s business were peculiar, since what\r\n  interested him infinitely more than his store were the two or three\r\n  societies to which he belonged and of which he was generally the\r\n  ‘Grand Panjandrum.’ There were constant meetings of committees and\r\n  sub-committees when there were not general ones. The principal society\r\n  was the ‘Union Fraternelle Française,’ a mutual-benefit affair of\r\n  which he was one of the founders and for many years the leading\r\n  figure.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMy grandfather enjoyed as well the making of speeches at Irish\r\nfestivals, where he would round off his conclusions with spirited\r\nperorations in the Gaelic tongue. Also he became an abolitionist, a\r\n“Black Republican,” during the Civil War; while, to involve matters\r\nstill further, he was a Freemason who insisted on associating with the\r\nNegro Freemasons, and presiding at their initiations. The white\r\nFreemasons thereupon blacklisted him.\r\n\r\nThe reminiscences say of him:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “In the daytime, notwithstanding mother’s gentle pleadings, instead of\r\n  preparing work, he was constantly writing letters about these\r\n  societies, all naturally to the serious detriment of his affairs.\r\n\r\n  “Nevertheless, for so small an establishment, father had an\r\n  extraordinary clientèle, embracing the names of most of the principal\r\n  families in New York—Governor Morgan, General Dix, some of the Astors,\r\n  Belmonts and the wife of General Daniel E. Sickles.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley also was a steady purchaser, for he delighted to wrangle\r\nwith this argumentative shoemaker upon the philosophy of footwear.\r\n\r\nThe reminiscences continue:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “No doubt those who came were attracted by my father’s picturesque\r\n  personality, as well as by the fact that at that time everything\r\n  French was the fashion, and by the steadiness of his assurance as to\r\n  the superiority and beauty of his productions. His sign, ‘French\r\n  Ladies’ Boots and Shoes,’ must have been irresistible when taken\r\n  together with the wonderfully complex mixture of his fierce French\r\n  accent and Irish brogue. This bewildering language was just as bad at\r\n  the end of fifty years as when he first landed. In the family he spoke\r\n  English to mother and French to the three boys; we spoke English to\r\n  mother and French to him; mother spoke English to all of us.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, further to adorn his discourse, my grandfather constantly\r\nembroidered his remarks with fantastic proverbs of uncertain and\r\ninternational origin. “As much use as a mustard plaster on a wooden\r\nleg,” he would say; or, “Sorry as a dog at his father’s funeral”; or “As\r\nhandy with his hands as a pig with his tail”; or “A cross before a dead\r\nman”; or (and this my father repeated after him through all his life)\r\n“What you are saying and nothing at all is the same thing.”\r\n\r\n“In addition, close to that time my mother’s cousin, John Daly, a marine\r\non one of the United States government ships, paid us a visit, when he\r\nread to us in papers brought from Honolulu and showed us great walrus\r\nteeth that had come from the Pacific. And finally I can see myself among\r\nthe other children who attended the Sunday school of St. Patrick’s\r\nCathedral in Elizabeth Street.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE BATTLE OF COLLIERVILLE.\r\n\r\n                        BY CAPT. P. J. CARMODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a lovely October morning the battalion left Memphis by rail. It was\r\nthe 11th day of the month,—Sunday—1863. The battalion consisted of the\r\nheadquarter guard, with General Sherman and his staff, destined to\r\nreinforce Grant at Chattanooga. We got away from Memphis about ten\r\no’clock, General Sherman, the staff and officers occupying the coaches.\r\nThe rest of the battalion took places on top of the cars. Everything\r\nwent smoothly enough until we got to Collierville, a small station about\r\ntwenty-six or seven miles out of Memphis. I did not feel exactly right\r\nthat morning; I had a premonition that something was going to happen,\r\nand, as first Sergeant of E Co., 13th U. S. Infantry, I was\r\nover-vigilant. I took particular pains to see that the men did not\r\nremove accoutrements.\r\n\r\nWithin something like a mile from Collierville, as the train panted\r\nalong, I discovered three men riding hard towards the track. They were\r\narmed with crowbars instead of guns. One of our men let fly a shot at\r\nthem, and the battalion was immediately in arms. The train stopped at\r\nthe station. It was nearly mid-day, and no time was lost in action. The\r\nfirst work of General Sherman was to telegraph to Germantown, about\r\ntwelve miles away, for hasty reinforcements, saying he had to cope with\r\na division of Confederates numbering 3,100, with five pieces of\r\nartillery. It was the one opportunity of a generation for the\r\nConfederates to make a great capture; and the result would have been\r\nsimple if those three men with crowbars and wire-cutting apparatus had\r\ngot in their work in time. But it was not to be; fortune was on our side\r\nand the telegram for reinforcements reached its destination in time.\r\n\r\nThe battalion was detrained and ordered to form a line of battle. I will\r\nnever forget that line. I looked to the right and to the left, scanning\r\nabout two hundred and forty as good and brave officers and men as ever\r\nmet an enemy. We marched in battle line two or three hundred yards from\r\nthe train towards the enemy, and were ordered to lie down. We observed\r\nthat communication was being made in the rebel lines with a flag of\r\ntruce. This communication was received by Col. Irish, commander of the\r\nlittle dismantled fort, with 240 or 250 men stationed at that point.\r\nGeneral Chalmers demanded the unconditional surrender of General\r\nSherman, his troops and supplies. He added that refusal would mean a\r\nuseless sacrifice of lives, because he had 3,100 cavalry, infantry and\r\nartillery in his command. What do you think your “Uncle Billy” said?\r\n“Give my compliments to General Chalmers,” said he, “and tell him that\r\nthe government pays me to fight, not to surrender.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the rebel aide rode back to his command, the ball opened with\r\ngrape and cannister; but they overshot us and only a few were wounded.\r\nThey threw four or five rounds into us, and the order was given to stand\r\nup and then to fall back on the fort and entrenchments. This was done in\r\nfairly good order, but let me tell you, comrades, we made awfully fast\r\ntime in the three hundred yards to the fort. I cast the heel of my\r\nshoe—shot off.\r\n\r\nThe men were disposed of to the very best advantage. It was an easy\r\nmatter to distribute the 240 of our battalion, and I suppose Col. Irish,\r\nwith his six companies of the 66th Indiana, did not have much trouble in\r\nplacing them where they would do most good. Well, here we were partially\r\nprotected by rifle pits, a dismantled fort, and a train of cars—480 men\r\nagainst an army of 3,100. Comrades, think of it!\r\n\r\nI had been paid at Memphis and I had two fifty dollar bills with me. I\r\nwas so sure of being captured, I cut the sole of my shoe open and\r\nslipped the two fifties in there. I knew that if we were taken\r\nprisoners, they would shake us down; and made up my mind that the money\r\nwould help my chances of escaping during the night if captured. It was\r\nhammer and tongs until about four o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time I had seen General Sherman under fire, and he\r\nwas certainly worth watching. He was mad as a march hare at being\r\ntrapped in such a manner; something was wrong in the line of\r\ncommunication—somebody had made a mistake. But he was Sherman all the\r\ntime that afternoon. I could not help studying this remarkable man\r\nwhenever I got the opportunity. Great as his anger was at the beginning,\r\nhe became later on, calm and resolute. The interior of this earthwork\r\ncontained about thirty or forty men and quite a number of cooks, waiters\r\nand followers of the headquarters’ guard. The general with his hat off\r\nin the broiling sun was a marvel to look at. When a man was shot he\r\nwould get one of these headquarters’ employees and say to him: “Don’t\r\nyou see that man is killed? Take his cartridge box and his gun and load\r\nit. Fight for your country, sir.”\r\n\r\nI had four men with me in defending one point. Two were wounded, which\r\nleft myself and two others, Privates Warner and Klineham. Pretty soon\r\nWarner was shot in the neck and killed instantly. The rebels had gotten\r\nin the trees around the fort, and were doing serious damage to those\r\ninside. The General was ever moving about, and I was afraid they would\r\nhit him. The only one of my companions from my company was shot in the\r\nbreast, and, I supposed, mortally wounded. When he was hit he said to\r\nme, “Sergeant, give me my knapsack, I want to go home.” I said, “Harry,\r\nwhat is the matter?” “Huh,” he said, and pointed to his breast. The\r\nblood was spurting from his wound, and I put my finger to his back to\r\nfind out if the ball had gone through. My finger sunk into a cavity, and\r\nI thought he was done for. I put him in a protected position and went\r\ndirect to General Sherman, who was only a few feet away.\r\n\r\nI said, “General, these men are being killed from the trees and you will\r\nsurely be hit if you don’t keep under cover.” What do you suppose I got\r\nfor an answer? “Sergeant,” said the General, “attend to your business,\r\nsir; attend to your business, I will take care of myself, sir.” I\r\nstopped at once making suggestions to the General as to his safety.\r\n\r\nOf course, I was not in a position to see anything of the fighting\r\noutside. I was a “lone fisherman” guarding my post. I was the only one\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the battalion in the earthworks and other shelter\r\nenabled us to hold our own until reinforcements came about four o’clock.\r\nThe first man to reach the fort and report to General Sherman was Col.\r\nTim O’Meara and his orderly bearing a green Irish flag of the 90th\r\nVolunteer Irish regiment.\r\n\r\nThe advance of reinforcements caused the rebels to fall back—without\r\nSherman and his “Little Battalion of Regulars,” as he always called\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe next order of business was to look after the wounded and bury the\r\ndead, which was done as soon as possible. It was now dark. Officers were\r\nbeing congratulated by the General with instructions to convey these\r\ncongratulations to their men.\r\n\r\nA singular thing happened that night. A captured rebel lieutenant was\r\nshot through the kneecap, which was shattered by the ball. Amputation\r\nabout the knee was necessary. He waited calmly until his turn came to be\r\ntreated. He was a fine handsome fellow. I felt sorry for him. He was a\r\nlarge heavy man. I helped put him on the improvised operating table and\r\nheld his limb while the surgeon was taking it off. He wore high, cavalry\r\nboots up to the knee. In removing the boot, I discovered a paper inside.\r\nIt was a pass through the lines for the day before. This man was\r\nevidently the spy who brought news of Sherman’s departure for Iuka,\r\nSunday morning.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I think we did a good day’s work, even if it was the\r\nSabbath day. The 13th U. S. Infantry and the 66th Indiana Volunteers are\r\nentitled to equal credit in this memorable engagement. They displayed\r\nthe highest soldierly qualities and genuine American manhood.\r\n\r\nAfter we had taken an invoice of the humanity on hand, we found that we\r\nhad lost in killed, wounded and missing a little over twenty-five per\r\ncent. of our command. I shall never forget the moment I saw that green\r\nflag and poor Colonel O’Meara saluting the General after the battle of\r\nCollierville. Being an Irishman myself, I naturally felt proud that the\r\nflag of the Emerald Isle had led the way to help save Sherman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MEMORIAL TO ROBERT EMMET.\r\n\r\n\r\nA unique memorial to Robert Emmet, to be erected by the subscriptions of\r\nAmericans of Irish birth or descent, is proposed by Miss Anna Gallagher\r\nof Boston, Mass., to take the form of a ship to bear the name of the\r\nIrish patriot.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that the craft shall be a combination of merchantman and\r\nsteamship to ply between ports in Ireland and America for the\r\ntransportation of Irish merchandise and passengers.\r\n\r\nMiss Gallagher and those who are associated with her in the project\r\nintend that the Robert Emmet shall be built in an Irish shipyard,\r\nprobably Belfast, by Irish workmen, and the materials used in the\r\nvessel’s construction shall be of Irish production or manufacture. The\r\nfurnishings of the vessel are also to be of Irish make.\r\n\r\nLaying patriotism and sentiment aside, the promoters of the enterprise\r\nhope to open a wider market and create a more general demand for the\r\nproducts and manufactured articles of the Emerald Isle.\r\n\r\nFor three months each year the Robert Emmet will be used for a vacation\r\nship, enabling those who so desire to take an ocean voyage in\r\ncomparative luxury at an expense, the promoters claim, less than that\r\nnow demanded for steerage passage by the regular steamship lines. All\r\npassengers will be carried in one class and one rate.\r\n\r\nMiss Gallagher is the originator of the Daniel O’Connell memorial, which\r\nis to take the form of a building somewhere in Boston or its suburbs for\r\nbusiness or other purposes, including a hall of fame to perpetuate the\r\nmemory of great Irish men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              CELTIC CROSS ON IRISH FAMINE VICTIMS’ GRAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the presence of about 7,000 American and Canadian Irishmen a monument\r\nwas unveiled and dedicated at Grosse Isle, Quebec, Aug. 15, 1909, to\r\ncommemorate the spot where 12,000 Irish immigrants, victims of the\r\nfamine fever and the ship fever of 1847–48, are buried in the long\r\ntrenches at the Quarantine Station on Grosse Isle, in the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver, forty miles from Quebec. The monument is a beautiful Celtic cross\r\nand it was erected by the Ancient Order of Hibernians. The solemn\r\nceremony was attended by many prominent Americans and Canadians of Irish\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe story which the monument will bring to the new people flocking to\r\nthis great country will be a story filled not only with the heart’s\r\nblood of a great race, but with undying evidence of the equal faith,\r\ncharity and hospitality of the French, who were the first settlers on\r\nthese shores. A tale of terror and suffering, of faith and courage, of\r\ndevotion to fellowman and unswerving loyalty to the faith of their\r\nfathers under the most bitter adversity is entwined about the great\r\ncross which now stands to mark the graves of ten thousand unknown\r\nmartyrs.\r\n\r\nDignitaries of the Church, high officials of state, priests and laymen,\r\nIrish and French, humble and of high degree, stood side by side beneath\r\nthe open sky, or kneeled silently before the great cross with but one\r\nthought—the honor of the martyrs who had died for their faith. To do\r\nhonor to their memories men had gathered from a score of Provinces and\r\nStates; many had traveled thousands of miles. Awe inspiring in its\r\nsolemnity, the scene carried to every bowed heart a meaning far beyond\r\nthe words of the speakers and left a mark which should last through a\r\nlifetime. A new epoch, a renewal of faith and brotherly love, was begun,\r\nand few there were in attendance who will not carry the spirit of the\r\ngreat gathering with them into daily life.\r\n\r\nFrom every standpoint the great ceremony was a success. Not a flaw\r\noccurred in the arrangements or their execution. In spite of the\r\ncomparative inaccessibility of Grosse Isle, every man, woman or child\r\nwho wished to attend the ceremonies was provided for. A perfect day\r\nsmiled on the scene, as boat after boat, crowded with passengers, left\r\nQuebec in the early morning. No one was left. No accident marred the\r\noccasion. Thousands had gathered in the city during the day and night.\r\nSpecial trains from Ottawa and Montreal brought their quota of members\r\nof the Ancient Order of Hibernians, of church dignitaries and government\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nTo the untiring zeal and energy of the A. O. H. officials was due the\r\nsuccess of the great undertaking. P. Keane, P. Doyle, T. Heavers, P.\r\nScullion, T. Heaney, J. Foley, H. N. Morrow, H. Cundy and other officers\r\nof the order in Montreal were in charge of the excursion from there.\r\nHaving already taken a leading part in the movement with the national\r\nconvention of the order in Indianapolis last year, which resulted in the\r\ndecision to erect the great memorial cross, these men were vitally\r\ninterested in the successful completion of the plan and their efforts\r\nwere fully rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe train from Montreal, carrying a delegation of several hundred, left\r\nSaturday night, and the party arrived in Quebec by six o’clock Sunday\r\nmorning. There they scattered about the old town until the sailing of\r\nthe boats, between nine and ten o’clock.\r\n\r\nFrom Ottawa almost an equally large delegation was in attendance. From\r\nToronto, Winnipeg and other cities representatives of the Ancient Order\r\nof Hibernians flocked to the great celebration, and many States\r\ncontributed their quota. As far away as Colorado branches of the order\r\nsent representatives, while four delegates traveled from Winnipeg. The\r\nStates represented were Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New\r\nYork, Wisconsin and Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe sail down the river from Quebec to Grosse Isle was a fitting prelude\r\nto the program which followed. Forming at the wharf on Grosse Isle the\r\nprocession, headed by the band, moved toward the cemetery. Following\r\nwere the Hibernian Knights of Montreal, Halifax, St. John, etc., the\r\nHibernian Cadets of Montreal and Quebec, the National Board and\r\nofficers, Hibernians of Montreal, Quebec and other cities, clergy, altar\r\nboys, invited guests and congregation. There Low Mass was celebrated by\r\nFather Hanley, C. SS. R., and following the sermon and attendant\r\nceremonies the vast audience moved to the high promontory of Telegraph\r\nHill, where the granite cross with its tablets overlooked the placid\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nAlmost more impressive than the scene of the kneeling thousands before\r\nthe open altar near the old cemetery was the scene at the foot of the\r\ngreat cross. Chief among the speakers at the monument was the Hon.\r\nCharles Murphy, Secretary of State. Introduced by Chairman C. J. Foy as\r\na man who needed no introduction for his prominence in the country and\r\nhis rise to power and influence, Mr. Murphy took the platform facing the\r\ncross and the broad expanse of the river, with the eager audience\r\ngathered in a natural amphitheater on the rock at his feet.\r\n\r\nTears came very near the surface as Mr. Murphy opened his address with\r\nthe reading of a telegram which he had received from Vancouver, B. C., a\r\nday or two before. “This telegram,” he said, “means to me the undying\r\nloyalty and devotion of the Irish people, and coming as it does from a\r\nfamily scattered throughout the continent, for the memory of a\r\ngrandmother long since dead, is particularly touching and typical.”\r\n\r\nThe telegram is self-explanatory. It follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        VANCOUVER, B. C., Aug. 11, 1909.\r\n\r\n  HON. CHARLES MURPHY:\r\n\r\n  Our beloved grandmother Graham was one of the fever victims of 1847.\r\n  Enclose $10 for flowers for the monument, and accept thanks of,\r\n\r\n                                   JAMES HARRISON BROWNLEE,\r\n                                          (_Prov. Surveyor, Vancouver_).\r\n                                   ARCHIBALD GRAHAM BROWNLEE,\r\n                                     (_Mining Engineer, Denver, Colo._).\r\n                                   MRS. STANTON,\r\n                                                              _Chicago_.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing Mr. Murphy took as the keynote of his address the fact that\r\nthe monument now stood as much an evidence of an enduring bond between\r\nthe Irish and the French as it did to the memories of the martyrs whose\r\ngraves it marked.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Fitzpatrick, Chief Justice, also spoke briefly at the\r\nmonument. The whole terrible tragedy was a manifestation of faith and\r\nloyalty, said he, which has helped and through the ages will help men to\r\ndie as men should, or live as men should.\r\n\r\nContinuing, he thanked the Papal Delegate and the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nfor their presence and closed with the remark: “Ireland has not been\r\ndesecrated and persecuted for nothing. It is her pride and her glory but\r\nto point to the Cross.”\r\n\r\nAt the early services at the open altar near the old cemetery the Rev.\r\nFather Maguire, Provincial Chaplain, A. O. H., preached an eloquent\r\nsermon, telling of the trials and sufferings of the ship fever victims\r\nand the devotion of the priests.\r\n\r\nMr. C. J. Foy, National Director A. O. H., presiding at the ceremonies\r\nat the monument, made a stirring address. Speaking briefly of the\r\nhistory of Ireland, he drew the great fact that though always\r\npersecuted, and always hounded, the Irish had never bowed in submission,\r\nand had never allowed a stain upon their religion or upon their homes.\r\nIn this he cited the French as a nation of similar pride.\r\n\r\nMr. Matthew Cummings, National President of the A. O. H., made a\r\ntouching and eloquent address, citing points in Irish history showing\r\nthe sadness of the nation’s history.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Turcotte, M. P., delivered an effective speech in French,\r\nexpressing the sympathy of the French Canadians with the Irish, their\r\nadmiration for the abiding faith and their pleasure in assistance at\r\nthis memorial for their martyrs.\r\n\r\nA short address in Gaelic by Major McCrystal, National Director A. O.\r\nH., concluded the speeches.\r\n\r\nMonsignor Sbaretti, Papal Delegate, then blessed the cross and the\r\nceremonies were at an end.\r\n\r\nReturning to Quebec in the early evening, the beauty and solemnity of\r\nthe sunset on the river lent the final touch of grandeur to the day. In\r\nQuebec the delegations scattered and took their various trains during\r\nthe course of the evening.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent men present were Monsignor Sbaretti, Papal Delegate;\r\nLieutenant-Governor Pelletier, Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, Chief Justice;\r\nHon. Charles Murphy, Secretary of State; Mr. M. Cummings, National\r\nPresident, A. O. H.; the Hon. E. B. Devlin, M. P.; the Hon. C. R.\r\nDevlin, J. A. Turcotte, M. P.\r\n\r\nBeautiful floral pieces were presented by the provincial government, the\r\nSte. Jean Baptiste Society of Montreal and Ste. Jean Baptiste Society of\r\nQuebec, and an anchor from Mrs. Lemieux of Quebec.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  IRISH PIONEERS IN SPRINGFIELD, MASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early history of the Irish in Springfield and vicinity is of deep\r\ninterest to those who are in sympathy with the sturdy people who are so\r\nimportant an element in our City, State and Nation. There are\r\nrevelations in even a cursory insight into early Irish history\r\nhereabouts. Few persons imagine how early Irish people were settled in\r\nthe vicinity of Springfield.\r\n\r\nIn “The Irish Pioneers of the Connecticut Valley,” by Edward A. Hall,\r\nand published in the “Papers and Proceedings of the Connecticut Valley\r\nHistorical Society,” one may learn of the earliest records of the Irish\r\nin this vicinity. In 1684 Henry Chapin sold sixteen acres of land on the\r\nwest side of the Connecticut to John Riley and this was described as\r\n“north of the Riley tracts,” so this was not the first land hereabouts\r\nowned by an Irishman. This is part of the so-called “Ireland parish” and\r\nthe present site of the Brightside home. Miles Morgan made his mark upon\r\nthe deed in the form of a pickaxe in witnessing it and it was recorded\r\nby John Holyoke.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Irish who were in New England at that time were\r\nthose who came, under the contract made in 1642, to supply three hundred\r\nmen and two hundred and fifty women in the prime of life for immigration\r\nto New England. These Irish men and women were drawn from near Cork,\r\nKerry, Waterford, Wexford and Tipperary, from the purest blood of the\r\nsouth of Ireland. The early Irish who came to this city and vicinity\r\nprobably numbered among them some who were in this first large migration\r\nto New England. Other towns about Springfield were able sooner to\r\nsupport a Catholic Church, for until about 1840 Springfield was a\r\nmission of Hartford or Chicopee. Rev. George Reardon, the first pastor,\r\nwas not a resident pastor, but lived in Worcester and conducted many\r\nmissions for miles about. Rev. John Dougherty, who came from Boston in\r\n1848, was the first resident pastor. A house for him on Howard street\r\nwas bought from Noah Porter.\r\n\r\nThe first church was bought of the Baptists and moved by George Dwight\r\nfrom its location at the corner of Maple and Mulberry streets to the\r\ncorner of Willow and Union streets. This was bought in 1846 and cost\r\n$3,500. The lot on Union street added another $1,000 to the expense of\r\ngetting the little seventy by forty-five foot church ready for the first\r\nCatholic services held in Springfield in a church building. Pastors from\r\nHartford and other places had for years before this said Masses in the\r\nopen air or in homes. But even with the starting of the new St.\r\nBenedict’s Church there was interruption of the regular services. The\r\nfirst resident pastor remained but three years, and for a time another\r\ncould not be secured, services being conducted by the Chicopee priest.\r\n\r\nMany Springfield Catholics walked to Sunday morning services at Cabot,\r\nnow Chicopee Center. Rev. Michael P. Gallagher, the next priest, was the\r\nearly Catholic clergyman here whose work was of the deepest importance.\r\nHe bought in 1860 the property at the corner of State and Elliott\r\nstreets, which has been added to until it has reached its present size\r\nand importance. Father Gallagher was a keen business man. The numbers of\r\nthe Irish in Springfield increased rapidly during the second quarter of\r\nthe nineteenth century. Two localities where the first Irish gathered\r\ntheir little houses were Ferry street and along old Mechanics row, which\r\nran between Howard and Bliss streets. Some of these people came all the\r\nway from Ireland to the back yards of their future homes by boat. Irish\r\nresidents of Springfield now can recall relatives of theirs who came\r\nfrom Ireland to New York, New York to Hartford and from Hartford to\r\nSpringfield in little steamboats.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hart and Mrs. Timothy Kenefick came from Ireland in the same\r\nvessel in 1833, and records say that their children were the first\r\nIrish-Americans baptized in the city. Fathers Reardon and Brady\r\nperformed the ceremonies at the time, when Mass was being said there\r\nonce a month or so in the family of some Catholic. The numbers of Irish\r\ncoming from their native country to America rapidly increased because of\r\nthe inducements which labor held out in the building of railroads and\r\nthe demand for factory employees caused by the rapid development of the\r\ncountry. The famine of 1847 caused a veritable stampede to America. It\r\nis said that there were twelve hundred Irish Catholics in the city when\r\nRev. M. P. Gallagher took the pastorate in 1856.\r\n\r\nThere were well-known names among the early Irish who lived in\r\nSpringfield. One of the most famous of these was Gen. Robert Emmet\r\nClary, who fought in the Civil War. He and his brothers and his sisters\r\nwere born in the home of their father, which was situated on Benton\r\nPark, at the corner of State and Federal streets. The father, Ethan\r\nAllen Clary, was a well-known figure in Indian wars and in the war of\r\n1812, when he was Commissary of the Port of Boston. John Mulligan,\r\npresident of the Connecticut River Railroad, was a well-known\r\nIrish-American. He came to the city nearly seventy years ago from\r\nHartford, where his father lived. He was the first child of Irish\r\nparents born in that city. Mr. Mulligan came to Springfield to work for\r\nthe Western Railroad and later came to be chief executive of the\r\nConnecticut River road, which was later absorbed by the Boston and\r\nMaine.\r\n\r\nThose who remember the early Irish as they were characteristically are\r\nfilled with astonishment at the contemplation of what some of the\r\ndescendants of those people have become. Along in the first of the time\r\nthe Irish were in Springfield in large numbers almost all of them were\r\nlaborers. The men were employed any way that they could earn money\r\nwithout much skill. Many of the women were employed as servants. There\r\nwas hardly an Irishman in business and for years not one in a\r\nprofession. Many remember Malley’s little dry goods store, which was\r\nnear where the Gilmore hotel is now, and which was burned in the big\r\nfire which took the Haynes Opera House. For years there was also a\r\nlittle shoe store on Main street, between Harrison avenue and Hilman\r\nstreet, kept by James Burke.\r\n\r\nNo one needs to have pointed to him the contrast which the virility of\r\nthose early Irish have made possible in their descendants. Irish are in\r\nevery activity of the city life, and the best of them are filling\r\ncreditably positions in every profession and business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONFERENCE WITH THE VICE-PRESIDENT FROM VIRGINIA AND MEMBERS OF THE\r\n                        SOCIETY FROM THAT STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to an invitation from Capt. James W. McCarrick,\r\nVice-President of the Society for Virginia, to the general officers for\r\na conference at Norfolk, Va., to discuss ways and means of adding to the\r\nSociety’s membership rolls from the lists of eligible Americans of Irish\r\nblood in that State, President-General Quinlan, Chairman Lenehan of the\r\nMembership Committee, and the Secretary-General visited Norfolk June\r\n24th last and were met at the steamship wharf by Capt. McCarrick,\r\nGeneral McGinnis and Mr. John Burke, and were escorted to the Virginia\r\nClub, which was made headquarters during the day.\r\n\r\nAfter a short visit to points of interest throughout the city the party\r\nreturned to the club and from there went to Ocean View, where they were\r\njoined by Hon. Joseph T. Lawless, Mr. John O’Connell, Mr. George Maxwell\r\nof Tuscaloosa, Alabama, President W. R. Boutwell of the Pilot\r\nAssociation, and Capt. Foster of the William A. Graves Company, where a\r\nbountiful southern dinner was served, which for novelty and excellence\r\nwas greatly appreciated by all present.\r\n\r\nFurther consideration of the work of the Society took place, and\r\nspeeches were made of an encouraging nature by all present and plans\r\nlaid for a campaign of membership in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe party dispersed late that afternoon, and the officers returned to\r\ntheir homes in the north well pleased with their visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SPLENDID ACHIEVEMENT IN ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nNo less enthusiasm in the good work of swelling the ranks of the\r\nAmerican Irish Historical Society is displayed by the Illinois Chapter\r\nthereof, and it is with great pleasure we are able to state the results\r\nof the excellent work done in that regard.\r\n\r\nOn October 19th, 1909, in response to a call from Vice-President\r\nMoloney, a meeting of the Illinois members was held at the Auditorium\r\nAnnex in the city of Chicago, and, as a result of that meeting,\r\nfifty-one members of high standing and ability were enrolled on our\r\nbooks, forty-two of whom thus far have qualified.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Moloney is due most of the credit for obtaining these valuable\r\nacquisitions to our membership roll, and the thanks of the Society are\r\nhereby tendered him for the ability and painstaking efforts expended in\r\nits behalf. Our roster for Illinois is a constant reminder of the noble\r\nwork accomplished by him, and a no more fitting tribute to his interest\r\nin the welfare of the Society can be paid than the character of the\r\nindividuals whom he has submitted for membership and who represent the\r\nhighest type of American citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GOOD NEWS FROM CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of St. Patrick, one of the most worthy and respected\r\norganizations on the Pacific Slope, composed of Irish Americans, who are\r\nnot only interested in the land from which their ancestors came but in\r\nthe United States and its institutions, conceived a plan in April last\r\nto bring together a number of leading citizens who would become members\r\nof the American Irish Historical Society, with a view to joining in its\r\nwork and if possible forming a State Chapter thereof.\r\n\r\nCapt. James Connolly, Vice-President of the Society for California, and\r\nJohn Mulhern, Secretary of the Knights of St. Patrick, with earnest and\r\nmost commendable effort discussed their plans with various individuals,\r\nand on February 17, 1910, sent the names of the following gentlemen to\r\nTreasurer-General Dooley, with checks for membership fees:\r\n\r\n                                                    February 17th, 1910.\r\n\r\n  R.

G. S. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nMr. Dennis H. Tierney, who was active in the collection of funds for\r\nCapt. George S. Anthony, of New Bedford, received a very nice letter\r\nfrom the Captain and in return sent him a letter of which the following\r\nis a part:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    “WATERBURY, CONN., December 8, 1909.\r\n\r\n  “_Captain George S. Anthony, New Bedford, Mass._:\r\n\r\n  “_My Dear Captain_—I received your kind letter of the 4th inst.\r\n  containing the endorsed checks which the contributors to your fund\r\n  desire to hold as souvenirs. A press of business prevented me from\r\n  replying at once. It is indeed a great pleasure for me to be among the\r\n  Irish gentlemen who have contributed towards the creation of a fund\r\n  which will release the mortgage from the home of a man who exposed\r\n  himself to the dangers incidental to the rescue of Irish political\r\n  prisoners who were confined in bondage in western Australia; ‘their\r\n  only crime being love of country,’ and for that brave and meritorious\r\n  service in their rescue which occurred April 17th, 1876; and in\r\n  reviewing the danger which you and your companions in a small boat\r\n  were exposed to on that stormy night of April 17th, 1876, it is an\r\n  incident worthy of the brush of Raphael and the pens of Moore and\r\n  Davis; even those great geniuses in their respective professions would\r\n  inadequately portray the thrilling incident, and therefore it is with\r\n  pride and pleasure that I, an Irishman, extend to you the right hand\r\n  of fellowship, and I believe my countrymen the world over are in\r\n  sympathy with me in it and do approve of my act.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to going to New Bedford on December 17, the delegation, headed\r\nby Lawrence H. O’Brien and Mr. Tierney, paid a visit to headquarters in\r\nProvidence, where they met Hon. Jno. W. Cummings of Fall River and Hon.\r\nHarry C. Curtis of Providence, and discussed the object of their visit\r\nto New Bedford, where they made formal presentation to Capt. Anthony of\r\na check for $1,037.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE FRENCH CAMP AT WATERBURY.\r\n\r\nMr. D. H. Tierney, vice-president of the Society for Connecticut, has\r\nerected on the camp ground of the French army to commemorate its march\r\nthrough Waterbury, Conn., enroute to Yorktown, June 27, 1781, a handsome\r\nmonument of rustic construction with a good foundation, securely\r\ncemented and with a polished granite slab on top on which the following\r\nwords are cut: “Camp of the French Army enroute to Yorktown, June 27,\r\n1781.” The date of the erection of the monument is cut on the lower\r\nleft-hand corner which is “1904.” Mr. Tierney writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The erection of this monument brought out and emphasized the fact\r\n  that in the French army there were a large contingent of Irishmen. At\r\n  the unveiling exercises, the monument was draped with the American,\r\n  French and Irish flags. An American boy raised the American flag; a\r\n  French boy raised the French flag; and my son, Mark Tierney, raised\r\n  the Irish flag. At the unveiling of the monument, we had a large\r\n  gathering of representatives of patriotic societies and citizens, and\r\n  it was learned for the first time that in the French army there was a\r\n  large delegation of Irishmen who participated with the French in\r\n  helping the continentals to throw off the English yoke. It created\r\n  such a controversy that I was compelled many times to give authentic\r\n  proof concerning the fact that there were Irishmen in the French army\r\n  on that occasion.\r\n\r\n  “At the time of the erection of this monument, I entertained hopes\r\n  that others along the route of the French army would see fit to erect\r\n  monuments in the different states commemorating the march of the\r\n  French army while enroute to Yorktown.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     COUNTY NAMES OF IRISH ORIGIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEight of the counties of North Carolina are called after plain Irishmen:\r\nBurke, from Governor Thomas Burke, born in Galway; Harnett, from\r\nCornelius Harnett, a member of the Continental Congress, born in Dublin;\r\nDobbs, for Gov. Arthur Dobbs, born in Carrickfergus; Rowan, for Robert\r\nRowan, a Colonial President of the Council, also a native of\r\nCarrickfergus; Montgomery, for Gen. Richard Montgomery of Donegal;\r\nMoore, for Gov. Maurice Moore, a distinguished Colonial soldier;\r\nRutherford, for General Griffith Rutherford of the Revolution, and\r\nDavidson, for William Davidson. The places of birth of the last three\r\nare not given, but their biographers say they were natives of Ireland.\r\nIn addition Gaston, Jackson, McDowell and Wayne counties, N. C., were\r\nnamed in honor of descendants of Irishmen.\r\n\r\nIn Maryland are Baltimore, Carroll, Garrett, Montgomery, and Talbot\r\ncounties. Baltimore got its name from an Englishman, of course, but he\r\ngot it from Baltimore, County Longford. Talbot was named after George\r\nTalbot of Castle Rooney, County Roscommon, the founder (in 1680) of\r\nextensive colonial estates in Maryland, called New Connaught, which with\r\nNew Munster and New Leinster were subdivisions of a larger territory\r\ncalled New Ireland, and now embraced in Hartford and Cecil counties,\r\nMaryland, and part of New Castle county, Delaware.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan are Antrim, Clare, Roscommon and Wexford, Barry, Calhoun,\r\nClinton, Emmet, Jackson, Macomb and Wayne counties.\r\n\r\nTwelve states of the Union have embalmed the name of Carroll, eleven\r\nthat of Calhoun, eight that of Butler and six that of Sullivan in the\r\nnomenclature of their counties. Carroll was the famous “Signer”; Calhoun\r\na Vice-President of the United States, the son of Patrick Calhoun of\r\nDonegal; Butler, the distinguished Major-General, one of five officers\r\nof the Revolutionary Army, all brothers, and all but one born in\r\nIreland, and Sullivan was the famous Major-General from New Hampshire,\r\nson of John Sullivan, a County Kerry schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nSan Patricio County, Texas, was named by a Spanishized Irishman, and it\r\nis not unlikely that Patrick County in Virginia was called after some\r\nIrish “Paddy.”\r\n\r\nThere are counties in the United States named O’Brien, Conway, Ulster,\r\nKearny, Kane, McDonough, McKean, Fergus, Meagher, Harney, McHenry,\r\nTaney, Shannon, Sheridan, Dunn, McCurtain, Sharkey, Walsh and many\r\nothers of similar origin. In Texas are Callahan, Nolan, Reagan, Donley,\r\nMcMullen, McLennon, Dawson, Calhoun, Cochran, Crockett, Fannin,\r\nGillespie, Hayes, Jackson, Jasper and Montgomery counties.\r\n\r\nIn Georgia, Burke, Bryan, Carroll, Coffee, Calhoun, Dawson, Dooly,\r\nDougherty, Earley, Fannin, Fulton, Glynn, Brady, Hart, Heard, Jackson,\r\nJasper, McDuffie, Montgomery, Pickens, Talbot and Wayne. Eleven of these\r\ncounties were called after native Irishmen who were prominent at one\r\ntime or another in the Cracker State. In Kentucky there are no less than\r\ntwenty-five counties, ten of which were named in honor of natives of the\r\nGreen Isle, and fifteen from descendants of Irish pioneers, while in\r\nKansas there are fourteen bearing Irish names.\r\n\r\nIndian names are in the majority in the nomenclature of our counties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HONOR FOR ENSIGN MONAGHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the torpedo boat destroyers recently authorized by Congress will\r\nbe named Monaghan, in memory of Ensign John Robert Monaghan, U. S. N.,\r\nwho was killed on April 1, 1899, by hostile natives in Samoa while\r\nengaged in a reconnaissance made by a combined force of British and\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nEnsign Monaghan was at that time attached to the Philadelphia. The\r\nexpedition ashore was in charge of Lieutenant Lansdale. Ensign Monaghan\r\nstood steadfast by his wounded superior and friend—one rifle against\r\nmany—one brave man against a score of savages. He knew he was doomed. He\r\ncould not yield. He died in heroic performance of duty.\r\n\r\nEnsign Monaghan was appointed to the Naval Academy on September 7, 1891,\r\nfrom the State of Washington. He was a son of Hon. James Monaghan, a\r\nmember of the Society, who kindly contributed to the Society’s library a\r\nvaluable and interesting work entitled “Life of John Robert Monaghan,\r\nthe Hero of Samoa.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MICHAEL HOGAN NAMED “CLAREMONT.”\r\n\r\n\r\nReminiscence of early New York days, when all of the upper west side\r\nfronting the river was occupied by the summer homes of the wealthy\r\ndowntown merchants, were revived by the announcement last December that\r\nthe last plot of land owned by the Post estate had been sold. The\r\nhistoric Claremont house, which for over half a century has been noted\r\nas a public house where the good things of life have been dispensed to\r\nthe elite of the town, was for many years the summer home of the Post\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe Claremont House, although removed from its original site several\r\nyears ago when Riverside Park was laid out in 1872, is now the only one\r\nof these old-fashioned residences that remains very much in its original\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nTo go back to the eighteenth century, we find that Nicholas de Peyster\r\nwas the owner of the vast estates, having purchased them from the Dutch\r\nfarmer, Adrian Hooglandt, in 1784. In 1796 he sold the upper part, that\r\nwhich has been known as Claremont, to George Pollock. He was an importer\r\nof Irish linens, and it was his little son, St. Clair Pollock, to whom\r\nthe simple tombstone below the house, and bearing the inscription, “To\r\nan amiable child,” was erected.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, the man who gave the name Claremont to the place, and who was\r\none of the most notable figures among the great merchants of his day,\r\npurchased the estate. This was Michael Hogan, a famous navigator, in his\r\nearly life in all parts of the world and who came to New York early in\r\nthe last century. He divided his property, calling the southern portion\r\nMonte Alta and the upper part Claremont. Hogan was a native of County\r\nClare, Ireland, and the name was in honor of his birthplace, although\r\nthe statement has been made that Hogan named it in honor of the royal\r\nresidence in Surrey of Prince William, Duke of Clarence, afterward King\r\nWilliam IV., and with whom the merchant had served as midshipman in the\r\nRoyal Navy.\r\n\r\nDuring Michael Hogan’s occupancy of Claremont, as a summer residence it\r\nwas the scene of some of the most brilliant social festivities in the\r\ncity. He was a vestryman of St. Michael’s Church, erected in 1805, on\r\nthe east side of the old Bloomingdale Road and Ninety-ninth Street.\r\nRobert T. Kemble and William Rogers, both of whom were early owners of\r\nthe famous Furniss house, were the wardens. It was from the Rogers\r\nestate that William P. Furniss purchased the house with twenty-six lots\r\nin 1843.\r\n\r\nHogan was practically ruined during the War of 1812 with England, and in\r\n1821 Joel Post purchased the property from his trustees.\r\n\r\nThe name of Michael Hogan is almost forgotten today, and the high honor\r\nthat Trinity Church paid to his memory after his death in Washington in\r\n1833, where his son, William Hogan, was a Congressman, is remembered by\r\nfew. A tablet was erected to his memory, but when old Trinity was torn\r\ndown, the tablet was removed to Grace Church, where it may be seen\r\ntoday. The inscription says:\r\n\r\n“In early manhood a bold and successful navigator and discoverer in seas\r\nalmost unknown; in maturer life a prosperous merchant. The decline of\r\nlife was not unmarked by vicissitudes of fortune. But prosperity did not\r\nelate nor could adversity subdue his firm and constant spirit. Each\r\nquarter of the globe bore witness to his enterprise and its success.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          ST. PATRICK’S HALF PENCE ONCE CURRENT IN NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only specimen in gold known of the coin called in America the Mark\r\nNewby farthing was sold in London in June, 1909. These farthings have an\r\ninteresting history. Many were struck in silver, copper, brass and even\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nThe obverse shows a crowned king kneeling and playing a harp. Above the\r\nharp is a crown, while around the border is the inscription “Floreat\r\nRex.” On the reverse the principal device shows St. Patrick, with right\r\nhand outstretched, banishing the serpents from Ireland. In his left hand\r\nhe carried a double or metropolitan cross and at the extreme right is a\r\nchurch. The inscription of the reverse reads “_Quiescat Plebs_.”\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of these farthings, of widely differing weights\r\nbut of nearly uniform size and with both plain and reeded edges. The\r\nsilver pieces are very irregular in their weight, which ranges from\r\nninety-eight to 176 grains, but all are about the size of an old\r\nfashioned copper cent. The coins struck in copper are more uniform,\r\naveraging about ninety-eight grains.\r\n\r\nThe coin is supposed to have had its origin in Ireland in the reign of\r\nCharles I., and it has been the subject of much discussion.\r\n\r\nA party of immigrants from Dublin, among whom were Mark Newby (or\r\nNewbie) and his family, arrived in the Colony of New Jersey on November\r\n19, 1681. Newby brought with him a quantity of the St. Patrick’s half\r\npence, as they were termed in Ireland. At this period fractional\r\ncurrency was exceedingly scarce in the Colony and on May 8, 1682, the\r\nNew Jersey authorities passed an act “for the more convenient payment of\r\nsmall sums,” which provided “that Mark Newbie’s half pence, called\r\nPatrick’s half pence, shall from and after the said 18th instant pass\r\nfor half pence current pay of this province, provided he, the said Mark,\r\nhis executors and administrators, shall and will change the said half\r\npence for pay equivalent upon demand; and provided also that no person\r\nor persons be hereby obliged to take more than five shillings in one\r\npayment.” The full text is found in the “Grants, Concessions and\r\nOriginal constitutions of the Province of New Jersey.”\r\n\r\nIt is not known how many of the coins were brought over by Newby, but\r\nthe quantity is supposed to have been large. Indeed, he is thought to\r\nhave manufactured additional coins of similar design in this country. No\r\nrepeal of the act making the St. Patrick’s half pence current appears on\r\nthe New Jersey records.\r\n\r\nThere were also St. Patrick’s half pence of large size, some of them a\r\nthird larger than those described. The larger pieces were struck in\r\ncopper and weighed on an average 144 grains. The obverse design is\r\nsimilar to that of the farthings but the reverse is entirely different.\r\n\r\nIt showed St. Patrick with a trefoil in his right hand, a crozier in his\r\nleft, surrounded by a crowd of people. On the left side is a shield with\r\nthree castles. The inscription is “_Ecce Grex_.” These coins also occur\r\nwith plain and reeded edges. The larger coins were called half pennies,\r\nwhile the smaller were termed farthings.\r\n\r\nThe coins must have passed current for many years after they were first\r\nmade, both in Ireland and in this country.\r\n\r\nThe Mark Newby coins in copper are plentiful even at the present time\r\nand command premiums of from fifty cents to five dollars, according to\r\ncondition and variety. Those of silver are scarcer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  CHAMPLAIN TER-CENTENARY CELEBRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pretentious ter-centenary celebration of the discovery of Lake\r\nChamplain was opened at Plattsburgh, New York, on July 4, 1909, with\r\nreligious services in all the churches. Pontifical high mass was\r\ncelebrated at Cliff Haven, the home of the Catholic Summer School of\r\nAmerica, by the Right Reverend Charles Henry Colton, D. D., Roman\r\nCatholic Bishop of Buffalo, New York, a member of our Society. The\r\ndeacon was Rev. John T. Driscoll of Fonda, New York, a member of our\r\nSociety, and among the attending prelates to Cardinal Gibbons was the\r\nRev. John Grimes, coadjutor of Syracuse, also a member of our Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              THREE “MOLL PITCHERS.” ONE WAS SURELY IRISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Faust and other correspondents leave the reading public in a\r\nquandary regarding “the heroine of Monmouth.” One claims that she was\r\nGerman, another that she was American, and another, on the authority of\r\nthe historian Lossing, declares that she was “a stout, red-haired,\r\nfreckle faced young Irish woman.” One says she was “Moll Pitcher,” the\r\nwife of John Hays, a Pennsylvania artillery-man, and another that she\r\nwas “Captain Molly,” the wife of a cannoneer from the banks of the\r\nHudson in the State of New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. WILLIAM E. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n  Formerly Secretary of the Navy and U. S. Senator from New Hampshire.\r\n  A New Member of the Society.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt probably has not occurred to these writers that three different women\r\nrepresenting three different sections of the country and three different\r\nnationalities help to make dubious this perplexing old story. In 1738\r\nthere was born at Lynn, Mass., a Mary Diamond, who married a man named\r\nRobert Pitcher and became a famous fortune teller. She died in 1813 and\r\nwas buried in the Western Burial Ground, West Lynn, where Lynn people\r\ntake pride in pointing out her grave, for barring the fact that she was\r\na fortune teller she was a reputable woman and her memory is respected.\r\nHer fame lived after her and in 1832 Whittier wrote a poem about her\r\nwhich renewed and increased the interest in her. Then a Boston\r\nplaywright named Jones wrote a drama called “Moll Pitcher, or the\r\nFortune Teller of Lynn,” which for more than thirty years was a popular\r\nfavorite on the New England stage. It was also played in other parts of\r\nthe country and was everywhere well received. The Lynn woman is the only\r\nMoll Pitcher that figured in history; with her the name originated, and\r\nothers who wear it are simply fakes and frauds.\r\n\r\nThe honors of the alleged incident at Monmouth are shared by two\r\ndifferent women, one of whom was from the Highlands of the Hudson and\r\nwas undoubtedly Irish, and the other was from Pennsylvania and\r\nundoubtedly German. Both, without any reason, are now frequently\r\nreferred to as Moll Pitcher. The real name of the Hudson River woman is\r\nnot known. Lossing calls her Captain Molly and E. P. Roe calls her Molly\r\nO’Flaharty. She was the wife of a gunner in Colonel Lamb’s artillery,\r\nwhose name does not appear upon the records as O’Flaharty but in fiction\r\nas Larry O’Flaharty.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1876, a communication appeared in a Carlisle newspaper claiming\r\nthat the Monmouth act had been performed by Molly McCauley, a woman who\r\nhad lived, died and was buried at Carlisle, and that Molly McCauley was\r\nMolly Pitcher. A man who knew her in his early boyhood canvassed the\r\ntown and raised a fund with which he erected and formally unveiled at\r\nher grave a handsome marker on which is inscribed: “Molly McCauley,\r\nRenowned in History as Molly Pitcher,” etc.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Molly McCauley never had any renown as Molly\r\nPitcher, but because it is so stated on a tombstone many people who read\r\nno other history believe it and quote it as conclusive proof that she\r\nwas the real Molly Pitcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE IRISH ORIGIN OF “YANKEE DOODLE” AND “DIXIE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nApropos of the recent query relative to the origin of “Dixie,” the\r\nfollowing letter of W. H. Grattan Flood, author of the “History of Irish\r\nMusic” and “History of the Harp,” may throw further light on this famous\r\nmelody. Mr. Flood is a responsible authority and is not given to\r\nunqualified statements, so his claim for Irish origin deserves\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n“My publishers duly forwarded me your letter, and I have much pleasure\r\nin answering it, if only to vindicate the Irish origin of ‘Yankee\r\nDoodle.’ ... Marion Harland merely repeats the exploded myth as told for\r\nthe past century in all published accounts of the origin of ‘Yankee\r\nDoodle’ until Charles I. and Cromwell Association was shown to be\r\nutterly absurd by Bartley Squire of the British Museum. The verses to\r\nLucy Lockett cannot possibly have been written before the year 1728,\r\nwhilst Kitty Fisher did not die until 1771.\r\n\r\n“I state now definitely that the tune of ‘Yankee Doodle’ is Irish and\r\nwas known before the year 1750 as ‘All the Way to Galway.’ The song of\r\n‘Yankee Doodle’ was adapted to this Irish air in 1755 (1756?) and the\r\nearliest reference to it is in April, 1767, when it was included as the\r\nfourth air in the comic opera of ‘The Disappointment.’ Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes rightly calls the air ‘a country dance,’ and a manuscript copy of\r\nthe Irish dance tune dated 1750 is still preserved. It was first printed\r\nby Aird of Glasgow in 1782.\r\n\r\n“‘Dixie’ is also an Irish air, merely arranged by Dan Emmett for\r\nBryant’s minstrels. By the way, Bryant himself, who ran the Christy\r\nminstrel business in New York in 1850, was an Irishman. His real name\r\nwas Cornelius O’Brien and he died in Brooklyn in 1902. There were three\r\nbrothers in the family, Cornelius (Neill), Daniel and Jerry. Neill gave\r\nthe Irish air to Dan Emmet, who sang it in New York in February, 1859.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                ARCHBISHOP McFAUL FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchbishop James A. McFaul, of Trenton, N. J., has announced that he has\r\npurchased a farm of 131 acres near Bennington, which will be opened soon\r\nas a refuge for the consumptive people of that section of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThey will have the run of the farm, upon which cottages will be erected,\r\nwithout expense and will be cared for without regard to race or creed.\r\nSisters of Charity will serve as nurses. It is the plan of the\r\narchbishop to secure additional lands as they may be needed.\r\n\r\nArchbishop McFaul was chairman of the commission appointed by Governor\r\nFort to lead the fight against tuberculosis in New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GOOD MEMBERSHIP SPIRIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreathing the proper spirit of enthusiasm, Hon. James M. Graham, M. C.,\r\nof Springfield, Illinois, writes to Mr. John J. Lenehan, chairman of the\r\nmembership committee, in part as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Your kind letter of the 7th inst. notifying me of my election to\r\n  membership in the American-Irish Historical Society, and the\r\n  accompanying pamphlet, are received.\r\n\r\n  “I am delighted to be a member of your splendid society and I assure\r\n  you when you express the wish that I will become interested in its\r\n  work, you tell but half the truth. I have been intensely interested in\r\n  this work for many years and I never expected to lose interest in it,\r\n  but now I feel that interest will be immeasurably stimulated by\r\n  association with your organization.\r\n\r\n  “The great influence of the Celt on American History and American Life\r\n  has not only not been acknowledged or made manifest by the historians,\r\n  but a deliberate and quite successful attempt has been made to prevent\r\n  its recognition. Ordinarily, when one robs and injures another he is\r\n  bound in self-defense to give the injured party a bad name and to\r\n  prevent him from getting a hearing as to the true facts in the case.\r\n  On this theory English History and English Literature for several\r\n  centuries past have been little more than a conspiracy against our\r\n  race. They were careful that they did not tell the truth to the world,\r\n  and equally careful to arrange it so that we could not.\r\n\r\n  “We are now, however, at the beginning of a new era in that regard and\r\n  it behooves every man of Celtic strain, indeed, every man who loves\r\n  truth, to put his shoulder to the wheel and help to get the machinery\r\n  in motion so that credit will be given where credit is due.\r\n\r\n  “I assure you that the pleasure you have in welcoming me to membership\r\n  in your society is but a tithe of the pleasure which I have in\r\n  entering it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BY COURTESY OF MR. FISKE O’HARA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Fiske O’Hara, the talented actor now playing Irish drama, extended a\r\nfew of the Rhode Island members of the Society the courtesy of a box at\r\nthe performance in the Empire Theatre, Tuesday, November 16, 1909.\r\n\r\nThere were present Col.

Robert Jackson Gamble, United States Senator from South Dakota,\r\nmade several interesting and well-prepared speeches in the Senate on the\r\nconsideration of the tariff bill. On May 21, 1909, the subject matter\r\nwas concerning mica, which is mined in large quantities in South Dakota,\r\nand during Senator Gamble’s remarks, a colloquy took place between\r\nSenator Aldrich and himself, which terminated with honors all in favor\r\nof our fellow member. On May 29, 1909, and June 22, 1909, the subjects\r\nunder discussion were barley and hides respectively, and on August 4,\r\n1909, while drawback on flaxseed was under consideration, Senator\r\nGamble’s speech was replete with sound argument and a multitude of\r\nstatistics which spoke volumes for the labor and research entailed in\r\ntheir preparation.\r\n\r\nThe Senator’s learned and forceful address at our Eleventh Annual\r\nMeeting in Washington, January 16, 1909, will long be remembered and may\r\nbe found complete in Vol. VIII. of the Journal at page 152.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    HON. LAWRENCE O. MURRAY ON PROBLEMS OF THE COMPTROLLER’S OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Lawrence O. Murray, LL. D., Comptroller of the Currency, read a\r\nmost excellent paper entitled “Some Problems of the Comptroller’s\r\nOffice,” before the American Bankers’ Association, September 14 last, at\r\nChicago. It was later published in Rand-McNally Bankers’ Monthly and\r\ncirculated throughout the country. Dr. Murray takes a natural pride in\r\nseeing the banks of the country grow in number, strength and popularity;\r\nbut believes expansion should be along normal, safe and conservative\r\nlines. “If we are to have a great system of banks, sound, well managed\r\nand prosperous,” says Dr. Murray, “the greatest attention and scrutiny\r\nmust be exercised before the government issues a charter. In the\r\nnational system we want banks organized in places where the demand is\r\nspontaneous and originates with the people living in the place who feel\r\nan actual need of banking facilities. I do not believe in the\r\norganization of banks by promoters who go about the country, calling\r\npublic meetings, and by methods of advertising characteristic of the\r\ncircus, endeavor to arouse enthusiasm for the organization of a bank.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         MAILING LIST OF THE AMERICAN IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Public Libraries._\r\n\r\n  Arlington, Mass.\r\n  Augusta, Me.\r\n  Baltimore, Md.\r\n  Bangor, Me.\r\n  Binghamton, N.

LENEHAN, ESQ., CHAIRMAN OF MEMBERSHIP COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Daniel H. O’Dwyer, an esteemed member of the American Irish\r\nHistorical Society and pastor of St. John’s Church at Kingsbridge Road\r\nand 232d Street, New York City, died on Sunday, November 14, 1909, of\r\napoplexy, at the home of his mother, 122 Fordham Road West, New York\r\nCity. His death occurred in the very room in which his father died on\r\nthe previous Thursday night, at the age of 81 years.\r\n\r\nFather O’Dwyer was a brother of Chief Justice Edward F. O’Dwyer, of the\r\nCity Court of the City of New York; also a member of our Society, and a\r\nson of John O’Dwyer and Catherine Ryan, who came from Ireland to America\r\nin the early part of the last century.\r\n\r\nFather O’Dwyer was born in New York City, in 1862, and was forty-seven\r\nyears of age at the time of his death. He was educated at St. Francis\r\nXavier’s College, West 16th Street, and entered Fordham University in\r\n1882, graduating from the latter institution two years later. After\r\ngraduation he entered St. Joseph’s Seminary, Troy, and was ordained on\r\nDecember 22, 1888.\r\n\r\nFrom 1890 to 1893 Father O’Dwyer labored as assistant priest in St.\r\nRaphael’s Church, West 40th Street, and later went to the Church of the\r\nBlessed Sacrament, where he remained until 1903, when he became pastor\r\nof St. John’s.\r\n\r\nHe found St. John’s Church a frame building, unimposing and\r\nunattractive. His first effort as pastor was the establishment of a\r\nchurch fund to improve the place of worship of the fast growing\r\ncongregation. St. John’s had been established in 1870 as a mission to\r\nthe parish of St. Elizabeth at Fort Washington and was made a separate\r\nparish in 1886, sixteen years after. He immediately set about improving\r\nthe parish generally. He changed and renovated the old church and began\r\nthe erection of a new one. The new church, built on the site of the old\r\none, was begun about four years ago. At the time of his death it had\r\nbeen finished but not yet dedicated. He devoted himself without reserve\r\nto the work of raising this splendid monument and labored tirelessly for\r\nthe accomplishment of his great purpose. The result was a structure\r\nmagnificent for the surrounding territory, and worthy of this great\r\nMetropolis. A spacious chapel occupied the basement, and in the rear was\r\na Lyceum or club for boys, with athletic apparatus and other attractions\r\nfor entertaining the youth of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThis soon became a social center. The young men found themselves in\r\npossession of a club with pleasant adjuncts and friendly companionship.\r\nHe organized numerous societies for both men and women and threw his\r\ngreat energy into the effort to make the hall a center of interest, with\r\nsuch force and vigor that it soon became the meeting place for the youth\r\nof the vicinage and elevated the moral and social conditions of the\r\nparish, which grew and strengthened with his success, kindling ambition\r\nand toning up the character and bearing of the neighborhood. That parish\r\nceased thereafter to be listless or easy-going. It blossomed with\r\nanimation and interest. He called the hall St. John’s Lyceum. The new\r\nchurch, with its various attachments, cost in the neighborhood of\r\n$200,000; but there was entertainment and amusement for all the young\r\nmen and women of his parish; and as they saw it grow in beauty and\r\nutility, witnessing the excellence of his ideas and the splendid manner\r\nof their execution, they knew their pastor worked unselfishly for them,\r\nand the amelioration of all conditions in his parish, uniting\r\nentertainment and instruction in his devoted purpose.\r\n\r\nTo aid the speedy completion of the church, he sought the help of a host\r\nof lifelong friends. Willing responses to a cheery appeal brought\r\nassistance from every side; and the work, ordinarily of years, grew to\r\nfruition within a few short seasons. His tireless efforts probably\r\nundermined his robust constitution. But loving his work and his people\r\nwith all his golden heart, he cast himself with streaming courage into\r\nthe battle, to win, in one brief spell, a victory that was fitting crown\r\nfor a lifetime’s labor.\r\n\r\nEverywhere Father O’Dwyer went he endeared himself to all with whom he\r\ncame in contact. In appearance a striking figure, handsome, tall,\r\nwell-proportioned and instinct with nervous force, he was a charming\r\ncompanion and a delightful speaker, versatile, amusing, instructive or\r\nlearned as suited his varying purposes or the needs of the hour. Jovial\r\nand sympathetic in ordinary intercourse, he never forgot the necessity\r\nof inculcating at the proper times the sterner duties. Yet he was always\r\nthe same wholesome force for the cheerful as well as the simple life.\r\n\r\n                As sunshine broken in the rill,\r\n                Though turned aside, is sunshine still.\r\n\r\nAn enthusiastic admirer of athletics he ever sought to perpetuate and\r\nassist in the games of his college as well as of his parochial school\r\nand the Lyceum.\r\n\r\nHe was elected President of the Fordham University Alumni Association\r\nfor two terms, 1899–1901, and materially aided the work of the\r\nAssociation with his usual irrepressible zeal.\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place from St. John’s Church on Wednesday, November 17,\r\n1909. His Grace, the Most Rev. Archbishop Farley, celebrated a Solemn\r\nMass of Requiem. The church was packed to its utmost capacity and a\r\nmultitude unable to gain admittance lined the outer roadway. A large\r\nattendance of clergymen and well-known laymen included many members of\r\nour Society, among them being Hon. John D. Crimmins, Justices Edward E.\r\nMcCall, and John W. Goff. Monsignor Mooney preached a touching sermon\r\nwherein he spoke eloquently of Father O’Dwyer’s zeal and attainments.\r\nMany were visibly affected to tears. He said that although a\r\ncomparatively young man his work was of the highest and most\r\npraiseworthy order.\r\n\r\n“Today,” said the Monsignor, “a mourning people and weeping children,\r\nall must send up not the exultant song of fondest hopes fulfilled, but\r\nthe low, sad plaint of sorrow for the soul of him who was their pastor\r\nkind and true. Twenty-one years ago he came forth with anointed hands\r\nfrom St. Joseph’s Seminary at Troy to begin the work that was appointed\r\nfor him. His first labors were served in St. Raphael’s, where he spread\r\nthe seeds of Christianity—seeds which quickly took root. None of the\r\nvigor and zeal of that manhood were lost which characterized his early\r\nwork when he was transferred to the Blessed Sacrament church. A thread\r\nof gold seemed to run through his life. It was in the city of his birth\r\nthat the whole years of his labors as a priest were spent. Six years of\r\nunabated toil marked his pastorate at St. John’s—six years spent in\r\nconstant labors of love till God called him forth. He gave the best that\r\nwas in him, he did the best for you, while he was permitted to remain\r\nwith you. All the splendid manhood he brought with him when he came—his\r\nexcellent equipment of mind and heart—he used to foster in his\r\ncongregation the love of God. He knew no bounds in his devotion to you\r\nand your little ones. The anguish of that awful morning was so deep, so\r\nsudden, that as yet we are not able to take in its full realization.\r\n\r\n“It was not deigned by heaven for him that he should ascend this altar\r\nand offer sacrifice—alas!—the first ceremony enacted within these walls\r\nwas over his own remains. His life labors are done; well did he perform\r\nthem. The God of Justice called him away, but you shall never forget\r\nhim, his memory will be to you a proper inheritance till time shall call\r\nyou on into eternity, where united with him there shall be no suffering\r\nin the everlasting Trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GENERAL ST. CLAIR A. MULHOLLAND.\r\n\r\n                       BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL.\r\n\r\nGeneral St. Clair A. Mulholland, one of the best known and most highly\r\nesteemed men in public life in Pennsylvania, and a life member of the\r\nAmerican-Irish Historical Society, died on Thursday, February 17, 1910,\r\nafter an illness of less than a week’s duration. Stricken on the 11th\r\ninst. in his office in the Federal Building, General Mulholland battled\r\nbravely to regain his health, but his advanced age—he was almost\r\nseventy-one years old—proved too great a handicap. Physicians ascribe\r\nhis death to a general breakdown.\r\n\r\nBrevet Major General St. Clair A. Mulholland, who at the close of the\r\nCivil War was one of the youngest of the major generals created during\r\nthat struggle, was a native of the County Antrim, Ireland, where he was\r\nborn in 1839. He came to this country with his parents when but eight\r\nyears old. While still a very young man he became connected with the\r\nPennsylvania militia, and when the Civil War broke out he entered the\r\nservice. For a brief period he was a recruiting officer, but in 1862 he\r\nwent to the front with the One Hundred and Sixteenth Pennsylvania\r\nVolunteers, which he helped to organize, as lieutenant colonel. This was\r\nin June, 1862, when he was only 23 years of age.\r\n\r\nSubsequently he was promoted to the colonelcy. He took part in the\r\nfights at Charlestown and Ashby’s Gap, Va., in October and November,\r\n1862. He commanded his regiment at Fredericksburg, in the famous charge\r\nof the Irish Brigade, of which the regiment formed a part, and was\r\nseverely wounded in the gallant attempt to storm Marye’s Heights. On\r\nFebruary 27, 1863, he was appointed major of battalion. In the battle of\r\nChancellorsville, Va., May 2, 3 and 4, 1863, he led his regiment, and\r\ndistinguished himself in saving the guns of the Fifth Maine Battery,\r\nwhich had been abandoned to the enemy. For this he was complimented in\r\ngeneral orders. In this campaign he was selected by General Hancock to\r\ncommand the picket line of the Second Corps, and while performing this\r\nduty covered the retreat of the Army of the Potomac from\r\nChancellorsville across the Rappahannock, for which service he was\r\nawarded a Congressional medal of honor.\r\n\r\nHe participated in the fight at Thoroughfare Gap, Va., June 25, 1863. In\r\nthe battle of Gettysburg he again led his regiment, which was\r\npractically annihilated. He then took command and led into action the\r\nOne Hundred and Fortieth Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers. He was\r\nengaged in the fight at Jones’ Cross Roads, July 10, 1863; at Falling\r\nWaters, July 14, and in the battle of the Wilderness, May 5, 1864, where\r\nhe was again wounded. For his gallant conduct on this occasion he was\r\nmade brevet brigadier general. He was in the fight at Tod’s Tavern, May\r\n10, 1864, and in the battle of Po River, where he was a third time\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nHaving been sent to the hospital at Washington, he remained only ten\r\ndays, and then resumed his command. He was engaged in the fight at North\r\nAnna and on the Pamunkey River, May 28, 30 and 31, 1864. At the battle\r\nof Topotomy Creek he was dangerously wounded by a musket ball through\r\nthe groin.\r\n\r\nHe commanded his brigade in all the actions around Petersburg until the\r\nend of the war. He particularly distinguished himself during this time\r\nby storming a rebel fort in front of his brigade, and for this he was\r\nbrevetted major general October 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1868, Daniel M. Fox was elected Mayor he called to his aid as\r\nchief of police General Mulholland, and it was due to the discipline\r\nwhich the latter inculcated that the force, before that time in some\r\ndisorder, was brought to a fine condition.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of President Cleveland General Mulholland was\r\nappointed pension agent at Philadelphia, a position he held continuously\r\nsince 1894.\r\n\r\nThe activities of General Mulholland covered a large field, and he was\r\nknown all over the State. As a speaker at Grand Army celebrations and in\r\neducational institutions he was always welcomed, and his vivid\r\ndescriptions of events in war times were listened to with interest.\r\n\r\nFor many years he was a member of the Board of Prison Inspectors, and it\r\nis said of him that he personally helped more unfortunates to start life\r\nanew than any other man in the State. He made the subject of prison\r\ndiscipline and its reform a study, and it was he who formed the\r\ncommittee that drafted the new parole law, as presented in the\r\nLegislature by Senator Ernst L. Tustin.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic, Loyal Legion, life\r\nmember of the American-Irish Historical Society, Medal of Honor Legion\r\nand Friendly Sons of St. Patrick (of which he was president from 1892 to\r\n1894). He was chairman of the committee of the Friendly Sons which had\r\ncharge of the erection of the Barry monument in Independence Square, and\r\nat the time of his death chairman of the commission appointed by\r\nGovernor Stuart to provide for the erection of the monument to the\r\nPennsylvania soldiers participating in the battle of Gettysburg. He was\r\na former president of the Catholic Alumni Sodality, and at the time of\r\nhis death, as chairman of a committee of the sodality, was working to\r\nraise funds for the erection of a monument to Rev. William Corby,\r\nchaplain of the Irish Brigade, showing Father Corby in the act of\r\nadministering absolution to the soldiers about to enter into battle at\r\nGettysburg.\r\n\r\nHimself an artist in water colors, General Mulholland during his trips\r\nabroad gathered many valuable paintings, which form a collection of\r\nworth at his home.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mulholland was twice married. His first wife was Mary Dooner,\r\nsister of the late Peter S. Dooner. His second wife was Mary Heenan,\r\ndaughter of Colonel Heenan and sister of Dr. Thomas E. Heenan, now\r\nUnited States Consul at Warsaw, Russia. The daughters of the deceased\r\nare: Mrs. Ludwig E. Faber, Mrs. Joseph I. Comber, Miss Mary Mulholland,\r\nMiss Genevieve Mulholland, Miss Claire Mulholland.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mulholland was a brother of the late Rev. James E. Mulholland,\r\nrector of St. Patrick’s Church, who died suddenly in Alexandria, Egypt,\r\nin 1886.\r\n\r\nThe following Sunday the general’s old comrades in arms and members of\r\nthe Loyal Legion, Grand Army of the Republic and delegations from other\r\norganizations visited the residence and held memorial exercises. About\r\none hundred members of the parish Holy Name Society, of which the\r\ndeceased was a member, accompanied by the rector, Rev. M. J. Crane, and\r\nthe spiritual director, Rev. Thomas J. Hanney, recited the Office for\r\nthe Dead at the house, as did also the Alumni Sodality, which had forty\r\nmembers present.\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place Monday morning, from the late residence of the\r\ndeceased, 4202 Chester Avenue. Solemn Requiem Mass was sung in St.\r\nFrancis de Sales’ Church by the rector, Rev. M. J. Crane. Rev. Joseph A.\r\nWhittaker was deacon; Rev. Thomas J. Hanney, sub-deacon, and Rev. Alfred\r\nC. Welsh, of Kennett Square, master of ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe absolution of the body was performed by Right Rev. Monsignor William\r\nKieran, D. D., rector of St. Patrick’s. In compliance with the wishes of\r\nthe deceased, there was no sermon, but Monsignor Kieran, who read the\r\nfuneral service in English as well as in Latin, made a brief address,\r\nalluding to the virtues and patriotism of this great man. The interment\r\nwas in Old Cathedral Cemetery.\r\n\r\nOne of the leading journals of Philadelphia states editorially:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “After seventy-three years of life’s battling, General St. Clair A.\r\n  Mulholland lies in a soldier’s grave. ‘After life’s fitful fever, he\r\n  sleeps well.’ Those who live well and die well surely sleep well. And\r\n  truly may it be said of the great and gallant Irishman who has laid\r\n  down his sword and gone to rest in his soldier’s cloak that he did all\r\n  a soldier could to live well and die well for the country of his\r\n  adoption, since he could not offer it for that of his nativity. It was\r\n  not his lot to fall on the field of his fame, but to rise from the\r\n  blood-soaked soil more than once to take up the task of the\r\n  soldier-saint, Louis of France, and reveal the tender heart of the\r\n  woman beating beneath the cuirass of the soldier. To visit the prisons\r\n  and to bear the message of solace to the despairing victims of a cruel\r\n  fate was the task which he marked out for himself, and carried out to\r\n  the very last healthful day of his official career. Many a stout and\r\n  steadfast heart has ‘the black North,’ as his native Ulster is\r\n  erroneously called, brought to the defense and glorification of the\r\n  American Union, but none surpassing in beautiful qualities that of the\r\n  quiet and unassuming soldier who now lies in a friendly grave in the\r\n  land he served, but far from the hills of his native Ulster, the land\r\n  of the O’Neills and the O’Donnells, and all the representatives of the\r\n  modern chivalry of ‘the Red Branch’—saints like Columbkille and\r\n  martyrs like Archbishop Plunkett.\r\n\r\n  “It is a unique glory that the flag of the American Union owns. She\r\n  has lured the bravest and the most unselfish from all lands to defend\r\n  her cause, and she lays the proud tribute of her gratitude and her\r\n  sorrow on their biers with a hand that knows no discrimination as to\r\n  nationality. The soldier from Antrim who gave his strong right arm, as\r\n  well as his unselfish heart, to her service was worthy of her, and she\r\n  of him. And so may it ever be as between America and Ireland. ‘_Quis\r\n  separabit?_’”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MGR. B. C. LENEHAN.\r\n\r\n                       BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL.\r\n\r\nMgr. B. C. Lenehan, who died September 21 last at Fort Dodge, Ia., was\r\nborn February 3, 1843, in New York City, and was baptized in the old New\r\nYork cathedral. He settled in Dubuque with his parents when ten years of\r\nage, and received his education in the Dubuque schools and took his\r\nclassical course at Vinentra college, Cape Girardeau, Mo., completing\r\nhis work at Milwaukee, Wis. He was ordained December 8, 1867, by\r\nArchbishop Hennessey. He was stationed at Mount McGregor, Iowa, for some\r\ntime before going to Sioux City.\r\n\r\nNowhere was the deceased clergyman better known or more loved than in\r\nSioux City, where he spent fourteen of the most active years of his\r\nministry.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1872, while a young priest, the monsignor was appointed pastor\r\nof Sioux City and during his fourteen years there he saw many changes in\r\nthe city and the surrounding territory. The completion of new railroads\r\nhad opened northwestern Iowa to settlement, and new settlers were coming\r\nin by thousands, many being Catholics. Sioux City was the nearest place\r\nwhere there was a church or a priest, and Father Lenehan was called on\r\nto attend to the spiritual wants of those settlers, scattered over an\r\nimmense territory, including all that portion of Iowa west of the Little\r\nSioux River and north to the Minnesota line, and consisting of about ten\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nAfter several months of strenuous missionary work Father Lenehan was\r\ngiven an assistant in Sioux City in the person of Rev. John J. Cadden,\r\nwho remained nearly two years, doing good work in city and country,\r\nwherever his services were needed. After leaving there he was sent to\r\nsouthern Iowa, and died several years later in the Davenport diocese.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 it became apparent that the congregation had outgrown the old\r\nframe church on West Seventh and Perry streets and that a larger and\r\nbetter building was needed. Father Lenehan erected a handsome brick\r\nchurch, which was dedicated under the patronage of St. Mary, Help of\r\nChristians, on the Sunday within the octave of the Assumption, on\r\nAugust, 1875, by Very Rev. John F. Brazil, of Des Moines, vicar general\r\nof the diocese. Rev. T. M. Lenihan, of Fort Dodge, was celebrant of the\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1886, after fourteen years of continuous and satisfactory\r\nservice, Father Lenehan resigned his charge in Sioux City to the great\r\nregret of all, both Catholic and Protestant. He intended to become a\r\nJesuit and took preliminary steps, but, the confinement not agreeing\r\nwith his health, he returned to Iowa. A delegation was sent from Sioux\r\nCity to Dubuque to make an effort to secure his return to Sioux City,\r\nbut other arrangements had already been made for Sioux City, and Father\r\nLenehan had been assigned to Denison. Later he was transferred to Boone,\r\nwhere he remained about sixteen years.\r\n\r\nWith the organization of the diocese of Sioux City and the appointment\r\nof Rt. Rev. P. J. Garrigan as its first bishop, there were several\r\nchanges. At the close of the first diocesan retreat for the priests on\r\nAugust 22, 1902, the first diocesan synod was held, and diocesan\r\nofficers were announced. Among the appointments was that of Father\r\nLenehan as vicar general. In November, 1903, he was transferred from\r\nBoone to Corpus Christi Church, Fort Dodge, the oldest and one of the\r\nbest parishes in the diocese.\r\n\r\nDuring Father Lenehan’s long residence in Sioux City he endeared himself\r\nnot only to his own flock, but to the people of every denomination and\r\nthose of none at all. All admired him for his eloquence and his\r\naffability.\r\n\r\nHonors only added to his natural and innate dignity of character. As Rt.\r\nRev. Mgr. Lenehan, domestic prelate to the pope and vicar general of the\r\ndiocese of Sioux City, he remained the same modest, unassuming priest,\r\nthe same “teacher of the silver tongue,” the same genial, companionable,\r\nChristian gentleman, as when he was pastor of old St. Mary’s, and\r\nmissionary teacher of half a diocese thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nMgr. Lenehan was a great friend of the younger priests, and his death\r\nwill be sincerely mourned by many a clergyman who got much inspiration\r\nthrough acquaintance with this exceptional man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JAMES McGOVERN.\r\n\r\n                  BY MR. JOHN G. O’KEEFFE OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nJames McGovern, a life member of this Society, was born of Irish parents\r\nin Brooklyn, N. Y., on the 31st day of August, 1854. When but fourteen\r\nyears of age he began his business life in the employ of Coleman\r\nBenedict, a stock broker. His progress was remarkable. In twelve years\r\nhe became a partner in the firm. He was elected a member of the New York\r\nStock Exchange in 1880 and during his long business career he was\r\nuniversally regarded as one of the ablest and most honorable men on\r\n’Change. He was honored time and again by election to its Board of\r\nGovernors, serving on its most important committees. Because of his high\r\ncharacter and broad knowledge of values his judgment on investments was\r\nwidely sought. For example, he was for years a prominent member of the\r\nFinance Committee of the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank and a director\r\nin the Kings Co. Trust Company, the Corn Exchange National Bank and the\r\nHome Life Insurance Company. He was also a member of the Chicago Stock\r\nExchange, the New York Chamber of Commerce, Metropolitan Museum of Art,\r\nMuseum of Natural History, the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, the\r\nCatholic and a number of other clubs in which he took an active and\r\nprominent interest.\r\n\r\nMr. McGovern’s charities were most liberal and carried on quietly,\r\nwithout ostentation. He was a benefactor of the Society of St. Vincent\r\nde Paul (a member of its Finance Committee) the Ozanam Club for Working\r\nBoys and many similar Societies. He was the President and best friend of\r\nthe Dominican Sisters of the sick poor, a charity that appealed directly\r\nto his generous heart.\r\n\r\nMr. McGovern was especially proud of his Irish ancestry and never failed\r\nto respond to any call for help from the land of his forefathers.\r\n\r\nHe died on November 6, 1909, and in his death the community at large\r\nsuffered a great loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        REV. MICHAEL A. McMANUS.\r\n\r\n                BY JAMES L. O’NEILL OF ELIZABETH, N. J.\r\n\r\nRev. Michael A. McManus, D. D., rector of St. Aloysius Church, Newark,\r\nN. J., died November 16, 1909. Deceased was the son of Lawrence A.\r\nMcManus of Paterson, N. J. It was in that city that he was born\r\nSeptember 29, 1849. When a boy he evinced his religious tendency and\r\ndetermined to become a priest. After obtaining permission from his\r\nparents, he went to Newark to consult with the late Archbishop Bayley,\r\nthen Bishop of Newark. Bishop Bayley noticing the slight figure before\r\nhim, at first did not appear inclined to give his consent but the\r\ndetermined manner and speech of the young man soon won the Bishop over.\r\n\r\nWhen he was quite young his father sent him to St. Charles College,\r\nEllicott City, Md., to begin his ecclesiastical training. He had\r\npreviously received a classical education at a private school in\r\nPaterson. After four years at St Charles he entered Seton Hall College,\r\nwhere he was graduated, and then entered the seminary of the Immaculate\r\nConception. He was ordained April 26, 1874, by the late Archbishop\r\nMichael Austin Corrigan, who was then Bishop of the diocese of Newark,\r\nwhich then comprised all of New Jersey. He was first sent to St.\r\nMichael’s Church, Jersey City. While attached to that Parish he became\r\nseriously ill and had to be sent to St. Francis Hospital. After\r\nrecovering he went to the Southern States and did missionary work for a\r\ncouple of years. On returning north he was sent as an assistant to the\r\nChurch of the Assumption, Morristown, N. J. Within a couple of years he\r\nwas made pastor of St. Patrick’s Church of Woodbury. He remained there\r\nuntil 1881, when the single dioceses comprised in the entire state, was\r\ndivided by the establishment of the Trenton diocese.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 he was sent to St. Joseph’s, Newton, N. J., remaining there\r\nuntil 1890, when Bishop Wiggar transferred him to Newark, and assigned\r\nto him the task of establishing the parish of the Sacred Heart. Finally\r\nhe was transferred to St. Aloysius’ Church of the same city in June,\r\n1906. Seton Hall College conferred on Father McManus the degree of\r\nDoctor of Philosophy. His unostentatious charity was something the\r\nextent of which was ever widening and often surprised those closest to\r\nhim. In public affairs he was always interested. He served on the grand\r\njury several years ago, being the first priest in the county who ever\r\nofficiated as a member of that body.\r\n\r\nSt. Aloysius School is his monument. He had been secretary of the Board\r\nof Trustees of St. Michael’s Hospital for many years and was one of the\r\nprime movers in the movement for a public park in the twelfth ward,\r\nNewark, a movement which culminated in the establishment of Riverbank\r\nPark, now in process of completion. He was known for his sturdy loyalty\r\nto the cause of Ireland, and he never lost an opportunity to lend it his\r\naid. He was strong also in his liking for the German people, whose\r\nlanguage he spoke fluently.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of Father McManus’ character was a rugged honesty buttressed\r\nby a courage that brooked no opposition. His convictions were clear cut\r\nand what he thought, that he said, and that he fought for, even though\r\nhis words occasionally gave some offense and his intensity provoked his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nBut it happened with him as it always happens with an honest man—it\r\nbecame apparent that he meant not to offend but to convince. With Father\r\nMcManus the smile always beamed after a remark, before the frown had\r\nscarcely time to gather. He was never bitter though always earnest and\r\nsincere. With such a man there is always satisfaction in dealing, one\r\nknows where he stands and what to expect; the entanglements of deceit\r\nare absent. Father McManus was well-read and his scholarship won for him\r\nthe degree of Doctor of Laws, from his Alma Mater. His administrative\r\nability was great, as the numerous works and foundation of his parish\r\nattest.\r\n\r\nHe was a pious priest, but his piety was of the manly kind that rejects\r\nshow or sentimentality. His faith was deep and earnest. He had a\r\nwholesome contempt for the modern juggling with fundamental tenets of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nHe was an ardent American, and believed in accepting all the duties and\r\nburdens, as well as the privileges of citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PHILIP C. WALSH.\r\n\r\n                        BY PHILIP C. WALSH, JR.\r\n\r\nPhilip C. Walsh, a member of the American Irish Historical Society since\r\n1897, died at his residence, 22 Grant Street, Newark, N. J., May 19,\r\n1909, in the seventy-fifth year of his life. He was born in the City of\r\nKilkenny, in 1834, was educated at St. Keren’s in that city, and\r\nemigrated to America in 1854, being associated with his uncle, Mathew\r\nNolan, a retired seaman of the United States navy, at New Brunswick, N.\r\nJ., where he married Annie Walsh of Gowran, Ireland, in 1858, removing\r\nto Newark, N. J., in 1865; while there he was engaged in the cattle\r\nbusiness until 1880, when he began the iron and steel business of Walsh\r\n& Sons, of which he was the head, until his death.\r\n\r\nFrom his youthful associations in Ireland, he imbibed a characteristic\r\nIrish antipathy to the government which had wrought such a malign\r\ninfluence upon his native land, and in America he promptly became a\r\nmember of the Irish organizations that were laboring for Ireland’s\r\ncause, offering his time and his services as occasion demanded, to the\r\nHibernian, Clan-na-Gael, Irish Volunteers and the American Irish\r\nHistorical Society, the success of which he was very proud, as well of\r\nthe Society as an organization tending to the uplift of the Irish, as he\r\nwas of the distinguished eminence so many of its individual members had\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nDuring his long life, Mr. Walsh steadily acquired every conceivable kind\r\nof book relating to Ireland, the Irish people, and their just cause, for\r\nwhich they had struggled so valiantly, gradually obtaining a very large\r\nlibrary of Irish works, some of them exceedingly rare and venerable, and\r\nby constant reading, study, and discussion with those well qualified,\r\nbecame a veritable encyclopedia upon Ireland and Irish history, being\r\nknown as one of New Jersey’s great Irishmen, a position which he proudly\r\nenjoyed as one of the best distinctions he had.\r\n\r\nAlthough not in good health, for the last two years, Mr. Walsh was about\r\nduring the pleasant weather, meeting old friends, discussing with them\r\nIrish affairs, showing as devoted an interest as ever, and at the\r\nmention of any proposition that would benefit Ireland his eye would\r\nbrighten and he would eagerly discuss every phase, from a position of\r\ngenuine interest actuated by a sincere, pure, high-minded desire, for\r\nthe progress and advancement of his native land which he always claimed\r\nwould equal any nation in the world if but given a fair opportunity, and\r\nwhose people, upon their native soil, would exhibit the same\r\nintelligence, ability and capacity, that they have exhibited in every\r\nwalk of life elsewhere throughout the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Walsh’s personal traits were the admirable ones characteristic of\r\nthe true Irishman, gentleness, kindliness and affection, mingled courage\r\nand tenacity. His family, to which he was most endeared, will ever\r\nregret his demise, and the sweet, gentle ties of father and children\r\nwill ever remain with them, as long as life remains.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a letter transmitting to the Secretary-General the above sketch “for\r\nthe record of the Society,” Philip C. Walsh, Jr., a member of the\r\nmunicipal corporations committee of the New Jersey Senate, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Father had a very high regard for the Society, and was especially\r\n  proud of the older members, who like himself, had been transplanted\r\n  here, and never losing for a moment the great affection they bore\r\n  their native land. The progress and advancement of the Society and its\r\n  members always brightened his eye, and brought forth approving\r\n  sentiments.\r\n\r\n  He was a typical Irishman—gentle, kind, affectionate and indulgent as\r\n  a woman on one side and as fierce and courageous as a lion upon the\r\n  other, the fighting spirit of his race, dominant when necessary; a\r\n  curious combination of admirable characteristics, opposite in their\r\n  nature, characteristics that seem more peculiar to Irishmen than any\r\n  other people.\r\n\r\n  During his long life, he collected a great number of books dealing\r\n  with Ireland and Irish affairs, all of which the writer is happy to\r\n  state were given to me, and I earnestly hope that I may ever be as\r\n  Irish as my dear father.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MAJOR JOHN W. BOURLET.\r\n\r\n                       BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL.\r\n\r\nMajor John W. Bourlet, secretary of the Rumford Printing Company of\r\nConcord, N. H., and for several years an esteemed member of the\r\nAmerican-Irish Historical Society, died at Concord, January 19, 1910,\r\nafter a protracted illness. Mr. Bourlet was born in New York City, March\r\n7, 1850, but in 1859 removed with his parents to Concord and resided in\r\nor near that city until his death, more than half a century later.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventeen, he entered the office of the Concord Monitor,\r\nas an apprentice to learn the printer’s trade and quickly became a\r\nproficient workman. He was advanced to the position of foreman of the\r\njob room and acquired prominence in his profession in the State of New\r\nHampshire and beyond as the organizer of the first printers’ association\r\nin the capital of New Hampshire. In 1893, Mr. Bourlet was nominated by\r\nGovernor John B. Smith as commissioner of the New Hampshire Bureau of\r\nLabor. This position he occupied until 1896 when upon the reorganization\r\nof the book and job printing department of the Monitor Company into a\r\nseparate corporation, Mr. Bourlet was made superintendent of the plant\r\nand a director in and clerk of the corporation. These positions he held\r\nuntil ill-health compelled him to retire from active work in the autumn\r\nof 1909.\r\n\r\nHe was widely known as one of the most prominent Odd Fellows in the\r\nState and long published a magazine devoted to this order. There were\r\nindeed few members of the fraternity who were not acquainted with this\r\ndevoted member and worker. The highest honors of the subordinate and\r\ngrand orders were conferred upon him. He was Grand Master in 1891–2, and\r\nGrand Representative to the Sovereign Grand Lodge in 1892–3. He was also\r\nsecretary of the Merrimack County Odd Fellows Relief Association. Mr.\r\nBourlet was a member of the New Hampshire Press Association also for\r\nmany years and a member of the Universalist Church of Concord. In 1871\r\nMr. Bourlet married Abbie A. Webster, who survives him. One son, John W.\r\nBourlet, Jr., and two grandchildren survive.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his long and highly respected residence in Concord, Mr.\r\nBourlet was honored by his fellow citizens with various positions of\r\nresponsibility. In 1887 he was elected a member of the Legislature from\r\nthe city of Concord and served as chairman of the Committee on Printers’\r\nAccounts and as clerk of the Committee on Labor. He was clerk of the\r\nMerrimack County Convention and for two years was auditor of Merrimack\r\nCounty. His exemplary life, his agreeable personality, his extensive\r\nknowledge of his calling and widespread acquaintance made Mr. Bourlet\r\none of the representative citizens of his city and state. The\r\nexpressions of sorrow from a large number of persons in his own city and\r\nelsewhere in the state and beyond its borders brought forth by the\r\nannouncement of his death were tributes of those who have known and\r\nappreciated his strong qualities as a citizen and a friend.\r\n\r\nEvery volume of the Journal of the Society was printed and published\r\nunder Major Bourlet’s supervision, and most of its pamphlets and other\r\npublications passed through his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MAURICE O’MEARA.\r\n\r\nMr. Maurice O’Meara, who died of heart failure Friday, January 14, 1910,\r\nin his seventy-sixth year, at his home, No. 83 Eighth Avenue, Brooklyn,\r\nwas born in New Street, New York City, and early became an expert in the\r\nvarious kinds and grades of paper and paper stock. He built up an\r\nimmense trade, and in 1890 organized the O’Meara Paper Company of which\r\nhe became president, with his three sons, Maurice, Jr., William and\r\nDavid, respectively, vice-president, treasurer and secretary. A year ago\r\nMr. O’Meara celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his business career,\r\nand a little later, on March 6, his golden wedding was an event that\r\nbrought him congratulations from friends far and near. He left three\r\nsons and seven daughters. He was an earnest member of the American-Irish\r\nHistorical Society; vice president of the New York Paper Dealers’\r\nAssociation; a trustee of the Brooklyn Catholic Orphan Asylum, also a\r\ntrustee of St. Francis Xavier’s Church, a member of the Montauk Club and\r\nmany benevolent organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GEORGE J. S. MURPHY.\r\n\r\nGeorge J. S. Murphy, secretary to the Elizabeth (N. J.) Board of Fire\r\nCommissioners and a valued member of this Society, died suddenly of\r\nheart disease September 2, 1909, in his thirty-ninth year, in a New York\r\nrestaurant, as he was ordering dinner.\r\n\r\nMr. Murphy was a son of the late Walter and Margaret M. Murphy, who were\r\nwell-known residents of the old Eighth ward, Elizabeth, where he was\r\nborn, his parents then residing at 726 Eugenia Place. His father was a\r\ncarpenter and builder and for twenty years or more was an election\r\nofficer in the Eighth ward.\r\n\r\nAs a boy, Mr. Murphy attended St. Mary’s parochial school and later on\r\nthe Morrel street school, from which he was graduated high in his class.\r\nHe next attended St. Peter’s College, in Jersey City, from which he also\r\nwas graduated with honors.\r\n\r\nMr. Murphy entered upon his duties as secretary to the Board of Fire\r\nCommissioners when it was organized in 1901, and during all the years he\r\nserved he never missed a single meeting, a record of which he felt\r\njustly proud. Mr. Murphy was a young man who believed in method, and the\r\naffairs of his office were conducted in a thorough, businesslike manner.\r\nHe kept a record of everything of importance connected with his office\r\nand was able at an instant’s notice to place his hands on whatever\r\nrecord might be desired. He was of a genial, pleasant disposition and as\r\none of the commissioners said: “He was the right man in the right\r\nplace.” There were few men better known in Elizabeth than was Mr.\r\nMurphy.\r\n\r\nHe was a communicant of St. Mary’s Church and a member of the Holy Name\r\nSociety connected with that parish. He was also a member of the Young\r\nMen’s Catholic Literary Association of St. Mary’s parish, and at one\r\ntime a member of the board of directors connected with that association.\r\nHe was also a member of and, at the time of his death, secretary of\r\nElizabeth Council, No. 253, Knights of Columbus, and also a member and\r\nsecretary of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, an organization in which\r\nhe took a very deep interest. He was interested in the Elizabethport\r\nBuilding and Loan Association and served as one of its auditors.\r\n\r\nHe was unmarried and is survived by two brothers, John J. and William B.\r\nMurphy, the former manager of the Barrett Manufacturing Company. Mr.\r\nMurphy’s mother died nine years ago of heart trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PATRICK O’BRIEN.\r\n\r\n                   BY MARK O’BRIEN OF LAWRENCE, MASS.\r\n\r\nPatrick O’Brien, one of Lawrence’s leading citizens and business men,\r\nand a member of this Society, died shortly after noon Monday, June 21,\r\n1909, at his home, 399 South Broadway. The deceased suffered a shock\r\nsome time ago and had since steadily failed until death relieved his\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\nMr. O’Brien was born in South Reading, now Wakefield, about fifty-seven\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of Lawrence Council, No. 67, K. of C., Division 8, A. O.\r\nH., and Phil Sheridan Colony, U. O. P. F. He was alderman for one year\r\nfrom ward six.\r\n\r\nHis wife, Anna; two daughters, Mrs. John Dempsey of Wakefield, and Mrs.\r\nFrank Cotter, and four sons, Michael, Mark, Patrick, Jr., and Robert;\r\none sister, Mary, and one brother, Dennis, survive him.\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place at St. Patrick’s Church, when a solemn high mass\r\nwas celebrated. Rev. Fr. James T. Landrigan was the officiant, and was\r\nassisted by Rev. Fr. Farrell as deacon and Rev. Fr. John J. Gilday as\r\nsub-deacon. At the offertory Miss Mary Dolan rendered the “De\r\nProfundis.” The church was crowded with mourning relatives and friends\r\nof the deceased. Delegations attended from Division 8, A. O. H., and\r\nLawrence Council, No. 67, K. of C.\r\n\r\nThe deceased was one of the older residents of the city and was held in\r\nhigh esteem and respect by all who knew him. He was prominent in the\r\nbusiness world for many years and constructed many of the large\r\nbuildings in the city.\r\n\r\nThe body reposed in a solid oak drop side, full couch casket, with\r\noxidized silver extension bar handles, and the plate bore the following\r\ninscription: “Patrick A. O’Brien, 1850–1909.”\r\n\r\nThe following acted as pallbearers: John A. Driscoll, Michael Roache,\r\nWilliam J. Carroll, James O’Neil, Thomas Gilmartin and Cornelius F.\r\nLynch. Burial was in the family tomb in the Immaculate cemetery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF NEW MEMBERS.\r\n\r\n_The members named below furnished biographical sketches at the request\r\nof the Secretary-General, and it is earnestly requested that those who\r\nhave not furnished such sketches do so at their earliest convenience, as\r\nthe Society desires to have its files complete as may be._\r\n\r\n\r\nBRADY, JOSEPH P., was born May 26, 1869, at Portsmouth, Virginia. He is\r\na son of Margaret E. and the late Colonel James D. Brady, both natives\r\nof Portsmouth, Virginia. His paternal grandparents were born in Ireland.\r\nHis maternal grandmother was also born there. Mr. Brady was educated at\r\nMcCabe’s University School, the University of Virginia and Georgetown\r\nUniversity, from which last named institution he graduated in 1896 with\r\ndegree LL. B. He was admitted to practice law June 29, 1896, and was so\r\nengaged when appointed Clerk of the United States District Court for the\r\nEastern District of Virginia on October 3, 1898.

His father and mother were both natives of Ireland,\r\nbut came to Virginia in early life, the former being but eleven years of\r\nage and the latter nine; therefore the son can justly claim to be a\r\nthorough Irish-American. He was compelled, through force of\r\ncircumstances, to go to work on the completion of his common school\r\neducation. He selected as his avocation the printing business, and\r\nserved a long and faithful apprenticeship in one of the largest\r\nestablishments in the Capital city. He was ambitious, however, and after\r\nworking for a short period in the capacity of journeyman printer in his\r\nnative city, determined to make Norfolk his home, get down to hard and\r\nincessant toil, and eventually establish a business of his own. He was\r\ntendered the position of foreman of the Virginian job printing office by\r\nthe late lamented Michael Glennan, the owner thereof, which he accepted,\r\nand at once entered upon his duties with that earnestness and vim which\r\nis characteristic of the man. His energy and executive ability proved\r\nvaluable factors in making his administration a successful one, and he\r\nwas highly commended therefor by his employer. A few months thereafter\r\nthe business over which he had presided was purchased, a co-partnership\r\nwas formed, and Mr. Burke became the senior proprietor. Today there\r\nstands in his adopted city, as a monument to his skill and good\r\nmanagement, the largest and best equipped printing plant in this section\r\nof the Southland—owned and controlled by Burke & Gregory, sole\r\nproprietors. Mr. Burke was a member of Norfolk Typographical Union and\r\nworked hard with his fellow members for the uplift of the craft. He has\r\nalso been an officer and influential member of the United Typothetæ, an\r\norganization of the employing printers, and his wise council was always\r\ninvoked when questions of great moment presented themselves. He is\r\ngenerally considered an indefatigable worker for Norfolk’s interest. He\r\nis a member of the Business Men’s Association, 200,000 League, and\r\nkindred organizations. As an evidence of the people’s appreciation of\r\nhim, Mr. Burke was elected sheriff in 1894, which position of trust he\r\nfilled with signal ability. In 1902 he was elected a member of the City\r\nCouncil, and he championed the people’s interest on every question\r\nbefore that body. For his faithful performance of duty he was returned\r\nto the Council at two subsequent elections and remained a member thereof\r\nuntil he resigned, on account of change of residence into another ward\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCAVANAGH, HOWARD W., was born in Alpena, Michigan, June 12, 1867, and is\r\nthe son of James and Mary Cavanagh, each of whom are of Irish\r\nextraction, James Cavanagh, who was born in Jefferson County, New York,\r\nbeing the son of Michael Cavanagh, who came to New York State from\r\nIreland in 1826, and of Mary Wilkinson, his wife, born in Canada and the\r\ndaughter of James Williamson, who came to Ontario from Ireland about the\r\nsame time.

His father, William Conlon, was the only son of\r\nRedmond Conlon, who was a descendant of an old Irish family of that\r\nname, and who resided on the homestead farm where William and young\r\nConlon first saw the light of day. His grandmother’s name was Phœbe\r\nPassmore, and his mother’s Catherine Sheridan, a descendant of the\r\nSheridan family of Ballinarea. The subject of this sketch came to\r\nNewark, New Jersey, at the age of thirteen years and attended private\r\nschools and Bryant-Stratton and Newark business colleges. He spent one\r\nyear at the carpenter’s trade, and was salesman for a local manufacturer\r\nfor five years. In 1873, he entered the fire insurance business and is\r\nthe senior member of the firm of R. P. Conlon & Son, Newark, New Jersey.\r\nHe was commissioned by Governor Ludlow, lieutenant of Company A (Irish)\r\nFirst Regiment, N. G. N. J., in 1882, and was offered a higher command\r\nwhich he declined. He was appointed by Governor Abbett in 1891, Judge of\r\nthe Second Criminal Court of the City of Newark, in which position he\r\nserved until 1894, when the Courts were changed by the legislature. He\r\nhas been an active member of the Newark Board of Trade for many years\r\nand is chairman of one of its most important committees. He has been a\r\nmember of the society of The Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of Newark, New\r\nJersey, since its incorporation in 1871. The two years he served as\r\npresident were among the most successful in its career. It was during\r\nhis term as president of the society that a _real Irish_ musical\r\nentertainment was organized to celebrate the 124th anniversary of the\r\nbirth of Thomas Moore, of which “The Newark Evening News” spoke in part\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Irish folk songs, sung in the Gaelic tongue; old Celtic airs played\r\n  by a band of harpists; the skirl of bagpipes in quicksteps to which\r\n  the ancient clans of Erin marched to battle, and melodious settings of\r\n  some of the lyrics which have immortalized Thomas Moore, helped to\r\n  make the concert, commemorating the 124th anniversary of the birthday\r\n  of that poet and patriot, given under the auspices of the Friendly\r\n  Sons of St. Patrick in the New Auditorium last night, the most unique\r\n  and one of the most interesting and enjoyable musical entertainment to\r\n  which attention has been invited here. The majority of persons in the\r\n  large auditorium boasted Irish ancestors, but even to the most knowing\r\n  music lovers among them much of what was heard was a revelation of\r\n  Ireland’s riches in folk songs and other music of racial character and\r\n  coloring, and of the beauty and charm of the Gaelic as a means of\r\n  melodious utterance. It is generally conceded that the Italian\r\n  language is more mellifluous than any other, when used in song. This\r\n  assumption might well be disputed after listening to Mrs. O’Donnell’s\r\n  singing in the Gaelic. Coming from her lips, the words which look so\r\n  strange in print, and so opposed to beauty in utterance, melted into\r\n  one another with a liquid smoothness comparable only to the purest\r\n  effect obtained in Italian.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on his advice that Grover Cleveland was invited to Newark on\r\nOctober 27, 1894, and acted as the Adjutant General in organizing the\r\ngreat demonstration which was the turning point of the campaign. In\r\n1893, he was elected the first president of the New Jersey Association\r\nof Fire Underwriters and was four times re-elected. He was also\r\npresident of the Underwriters’ Protective Association (Salvage Corps)\r\nNewark. At the formation of the Newark Fire Insurance Exchange in 1902,\r\nhe was chosen president and declined re-election. On October 12, 1876,\r\nMr. Conlon married Margaret Agnes Heery, daughter of Philip and\r\nElizabeth Heery, of Newark, New Jersey. They have three daughters and\r\nfour sons living. The eldest son, William R., is affiliated with his\r\nfather in business. Francis is a surveyor and engineer. Philip is due to\r\ngraduate from the University of Pennsylvania in June, 1910, and Joseph\r\nis a law student at the New York University.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCONNOR, HENRY GROVES, LL.

S., was born in Red Wing, Minn., February 28, 1865.\r\nHer father was James Gallup Stoddard, a direct descendant of Elder\r\nWilliam Brewster, who came in the Mayflower in 1620, and of Gov.\r\nTheophilus Eaton, one of the founders of New Haven Colony, Conn.; his\r\nfather, Jonathan Stoddard, was the son of Mark Stoddard, sergeant of\r\n10th Co., 6th Regiment, Connecticut Troops, at Battle of Bunker Hill,\r\nand Lucy (Ally) Stoddard, who was a sister to Captain Samuel Allyn, who\r\nwas killed at Fort Griswold, Conn., at the time of Arnold’s invasion of\r\nConnecticut. The mother of James Gallup Stoddard was Hannah Morgan, a\r\ndaughter of Captain Israel Morgan of Groton, Conn., who served under\r\nGates during the Revolutionary War, and who was one of the defenders of\r\nStonington, Conn., at its bombardment during the war of 1812; she was\r\nalso a direct descendant of James Fitch, chaplain of the Connecticut\r\nforces during King Philip’s War under Majors Treat and Talcott, of Henry\r\nWolcott, one of the early settlers of Windsor, Conn., and of Rev. Henry\r\nWhitfield of Guilford, Conn. The mother of the subject of this sketch\r\nwas Margaret Barr, daughter of Andrew and Mary (Auld) Barr. Andrew Barr\r\nwas born in Ireland in 1815 and was the son of Andrew and Martha\r\n(Douglas) Barr; he married in Ireland, in 1838, Mary Auld, daughter of\r\nRobert and Margaret (Stewart) Auld; they resided in Parish of Carmony,\r\nTown of Ballyhone, County Antrim, Ireland, until August, 1840, when they\r\ncame to America, settling first at Henrietta, N. Y., thence to\r\nWisconsin, then to Red Wing, Minn.; he enlisted in Company E, 3d\r\nMinnesota Volunteers, at the outbreak of the Civil War, where he served\r\nfor five years, the latter part of his service acting as regimental\r\nveterinarian. She was educated in the schools of Humboldt, Iowa,\r\ngraduating from the High School at the age of fifteen years. Upon\r\nleaving school she accepted a position with the Humboldt County Bank,\r\nnow the Humboldt State Bank, where she has worked ever since, at the\r\npresent time being one of the directors, secretary of the board of\r\ndirectors and assistant cashier. She was married June 27, 1888, at\r\nHumboldt, Iowa, to Robert J. Johnston, son of John and Jane (Porter)\r\nJohnston. Mrs. Johnston is interested in the work of patriotic societies\r\nand club work, and at the present time is State Historian of the Iowa\r\nDaughters of the American Revolution, vice-president of the Iowa United\r\nStates Daughters of 1812, and state treasurer of the Iowa Federation of\r\nWomen’s Clubs.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKEENAN, FRANK, was born April 8, 1859, in Dubuque, Iowa, where he lived\r\nfor one year, moving to Boston with his parents, and attending the old\r\nRice school in Boston. He made his first theatrical appearance on any\r\nstage at the Boston College in “Wild Oats” in 1876, and then started to\r\nlearn the wholesale dry goods business. After several years he was sent\r\nout as a salesman on the road, later going into the wholesale cigar\r\nbusiness as a traveling salesman. During this time he began to take up\r\namateur theatricals, and gave imitations of popular actors whom he had\r\nnever seen. Securing employment with the largest importers of German\r\ncutlery in New York, he left his samples in Connecticut town, slipped up\r\nto Boston and played “Green Jones” in “The Ticket of Leave Man,” in an\r\namateur performance at Chelsea. On the strength of his performance he\r\nwas engaged as leading man for “Musical Thompson’s repertoire company,”\r\nabout to play the state of Maine, at a salary of $9 a week and board. He\r\nopened as Archibald Carlisle in “East Lynn,” and the next night played\r\nTom Badger in “The Streets of New York.” This company carried its own\r\nscenery as the halls played had no scenery. The engagement was\r\nshort-lived as salaries soon ceased to appear. His next professional\r\nengagement was with the tragedian Joseph Proctor. The part was Wenonga,\r\nthe Indian chief in “Nick of the Woods,” under the management of that\r\nveteran stage manager and splendid actor, J. W. Lanergan, at his own\r\ntheatre, the Lawrence Opera House at Lawrence, Mass. The repertoire\r\nincluded “Virginius,” “Damon and Pythias,” “Othello,” “The Red\r\nPocketbook,” “Lady of Lyons,” “La Tour de Nelle,” and other sensational\r\nold timers. Under the direction of Lanergan this proved a successful and\r\nsplendid school, such a one as does not exist today, for the young\r\nactor, for then one learned the trade, received the ground work of\r\ninstruction—dramatic expression, movement, and grace. Following this\r\ncame an engagement with Sol Smith Russell as the Deacon in his first\r\nplay, “Edgewood Folks,” after which came an engagement with the Boston\r\nMuseum Company, in the original production in this country of “Nunky,”\r\nafterwards called “The Private Secretary.” Then came the position of\r\nstage manager of a large company, having thirty-two plays in repertoire,\r\ntouring New England; and engagements with prominent stars, including\r\nJames A. Hearne, in “The Minute Man.” Then a starring engagement of his\r\nown in repertoire through the West, followed by “The Counterfeiter” in\r\nthe original production of Steele Mackeye’s play, “The Noble Rogue,” in\r\nChicago. This engagement was followed by a starring tour as “Terry\r\nDenison” in James A. Hearne’s play, “Hearts of Oak,” and a season\r\nco-starring with the Irish comedian, Billy Barry, in “McKenna’s\r\nFlirtation.” He then played “Fagin” in “Oliver Twist,” followed by the\r\ngypsy, “Miles McKenna,” in “Rosedale,” and stock starring in his own\r\ncompanies in Providence and Boston. A long engagement followed with the\r\nlate Charles H. Hoyt and Frank McKee—in the New York production of “The\r\nMilk White Flag,” and “The Contented Woman.” This followed by his own\r\nproduction, the greatest scenic production ever made of “Oliver Twist.”\r\nThis was followed by a return to the Hoyt forces. The next engagement\r\nwas with “The Texas Steer,” in the part of “Maverick Brander,” under the\r\nlate Sam S. Shubert, his first experience as a manager. Then came an\r\nengagement in Augustus Thomas’ play, “The Capitol,” under the management\r\nof James Hill, at the Standard Theatre, New York. This was followed by a\r\nperformance of “The Major” in Jacob Litt’s original production of “The\r\nWar of Wealth.” Then as director of the Pike Stock Company for a season\r\nin Cincinnati, Ohio, and on the collapse of the late Sol Smith Russell\r\ncame a starring tour of two years in “The Poor Relation,” followed by\r\nanother season starring in “The Honorable John Grigsby.” Then two\r\nseasons in vaudeville, after which came an engagement under the\r\nmanagement of David Belasco, which lasted four years, including the\r\nparts of “Jack Rance” in “The Girl of the Golden West,” and “General\r\nBuck” in “The Warrens of Virginia.” Mr. Keenan is starring this season\r\nin “The Heights” under the management of Henry B. Harris.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKEENAN, WALTER F., was born in Philadelphia on October 20, 1855. His\r\nparents were Michael F.

He quickly realized that the old land, under its alien rulers,\r\noffered very little encouragement for a patriotic, ambitious young man,\r\nso he turned towards this “land of opportunity,” arriving in the United\r\nStates in 1893 and settling in Baltimore, Md. He became connected with a\r\nmercantile agency and diligently applied himself to master the business.\r\nWith this end in view, while working daily at his regular duties, he\r\nattended a business college at night and became proficient in\r\ntypewriting, stenography, accounting and the usual commercial studies.\r\nLater he attended the evening classes of the Baltimore Law School. He\r\nwas admitted to the Baltimore Bar in 1904. In association with Robert W.\r\nMobray, he formed the law firm of Kehoe & Mobray with offices at 502–506\r\nLaw Building, Baltimore, Md.\r\n\r\nTo add to his legal training he took post-graduate courses at the\r\nCatholic University of America at Washington, D. C., making a special\r\nstudy of corporation law. The University conferred on him degrees of LL.\r\nM. in 1906 and J. D. in 1907. He was elected to serve as a delegate from\r\nBaltimore County in the Maryland legislature for 1907–1908. He was a\r\nmember of the corporations, claims and various other important\r\ncommittees. In the Spring of 1909, he delivered, by request, before the\r\nPhilosophical students of the Catholic University, several lectures on\r\nthe “Procedure of Legislative Bodies,” drawing upon his practical\r\nexperience in the Maryland legislature. Mr. Kehoe has maintained\r\nunflagging, fervent interest in the movement to restore Home Rule to the\r\nland of his birth. Indeed, at one time he contemplated a return to\r\nIreland to offer himself as a candidate for Parliament. He has been\r\nactively identified with the United Irish League of America, being among\r\nthe first to welcome Messrs. Redmond, O’Donnell and McHugh when those\r\ngentlemen visited the United States to establish the League. He was a\r\nmember of the Provisional Committee of the League which met at the\r\nHoffman House, New York City, in 1901. He was also a delegate to the\r\nNational Convention of the United Irish League when it met at Boston,\r\nMass., in 1902. Mr. Kehoe has managed to make a thorough study of Irish\r\nhistory and the Irish National cause. He is especially well versed in\r\nthe speeches of the great Irish orators, having made a careful study of\r\nthem. He is in great demand by the various Irish societies as an orator.\r\nNot content with using his voice in behalf of the Irish race, he has\r\nalso used his pen. He wrote an extended series of “Studies in Irish\r\nHistory,” for the Baltimore Catholic Mirror a few years ago. They\r\nattracted considerable attention and displayed extensive research and\r\nwide reading. He is a student of political and economic subjects. In\r\npolitics, Mr. Kehoe is a Democrat, takes an active part in the\r\nmanagement of the party, and is one of its recognized leaders in his\r\ncounty. He is County President of the Ancient Order of Hibernians in\r\nBaltimore County, and is an active member of the Catholic Benevolent\r\nLegion, the Elks, Knights of the Golden Eagle, Royal Arcanum, and the\r\nTribe of Ben Hur. In 1900 he married Miss Catherine Byrne; the couple\r\nhave six children. He is a director of and counsel for the Suburban\r\nTrust Company of Govans, Baltimore County, Maryland, where he resides.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKELLEY, JOHN W., was born December 3, 1865, in Portsmouth, N.

He was a\r\ndelegate-at-large to the National Convention at St. Louis in 1896 which\r\nnominated McKinley, and was again a delegate-at-large and chairman of\r\nhis delegation to the Chicago Convention of 1904 which nominated\r\nRoosevelt.

B. in\r\nthe Jesuit College (St. Louis University); worked as bank clerk, stock\r\nand bond broker and finally contractor. He married in 1874 Sallie Helm\r\nFord (now deceased), granddaughter of Governor Helm of Kentucky, and\r\ngrandniece of Brigadier-General Hardin Helm, late C. S. A., the latter\r\nbeing married to a Miss Todd, sister of the wife of the ever lamented\r\nAbraham Lincoln. He is secretary of the Hill-O’Meara Construction\r\nCompany, and although offered minor political offices many times he\r\ndeclined to serve until 1894, when he was elected Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nMissouri on the Democratic ticket. He takes a very great interest in the\r\nNational Guard, having been connected with it since 1872 and is now\r\nPaymaster General of the Missouri troops. Among the soldiers who\r\nsurrendered at Limerick with Sarsfield, was an ancestor, Patrick\r\nO’Meara, who became a colonel of the Irish Brigade or more correctly\r\nspeaking the “Legion Irlandais de France.” He afterward married a lady\r\nof a distinguished house of France, and reared a family, two sons of\r\nwhich, Jean Baptiste and Daniel, followed the footsteps of their father.\r\nWhen they became able to bear arms they also entered the “Legion,” one\r\nof them becoming “Lieutenant en premier” in Walsh’s Regiment, the other\r\n“Lieutenant en second” in Dillon’s Regiment of that corps. When\r\nWashington made his earnest and final appeal to Louis for more troops,\r\nthe French king sent some twenty thousand picked men, with a splendid\r\nfleet under Count d’Estaing, and among these troops came Dillon’s and\r\nWalsh’s Regiments, bringing Jean Baptiste and Daniel O’Meara, John B’s\r\ngrandfather and granduncle. The French ships engaged the British fleet\r\noff Savannah, Georgia, and although it was a drawn battle, owing to a\r\nsevere storm, they bottled up the British fleet in Savannah, and\r\nprevented them from carrying out their plan to come to the assistance of\r\nCornwallis. Meantime d’Estaing moved some of his ships lower down the\r\ncoast, disembarked several regiments including Dillon’s and Walsh’s,\r\nwhich marched overland and happily met the retreating forces of\r\nLafayette who were being pursued by a portion of the British force from\r\nYorktown. Lafayette now being reinforced turned on his enemies, and\r\ndrove them back to Yorktown where coöperating with Washington soon\r\nforced Cornwallis to surrender. When d’Estaing and his fleet, shortly\r\nafter, sailed back to France, his grandfather and uncle being Frenchmen,\r\nwent back with them. The revolution soon broke out, and his folks being\r\nRoyalists and hating the sans culottes and proletariats, stood with the\r\nLegion which suffered terribly defending the King, until overpowered by\r\nnumbers. His grandfather, disgusted with affairs in France, went back to\r\nthe land of his forbears and settled in a little town called Athey,\r\nCounty of Kildare, the birthplace of the Duke of Wellington. There his\r\ngrandfather married and there his father, Patrick, was born. He came to\r\nthis country in 1832 and after living in New Orleans and in Boston\r\nsettled and brought up his family, one of whom, a sister, Madame\r\nO’Meara, was superior of the Sacred Heart Order in New York City and is\r\nnow superior of that order in New Orleans, Louisiana. The facts of the\r\nrevolutionary story as above are in “United States Senate Document No.\r\n77” entitled “Combattants Francais es dans Le Guerre Americain—1777–83.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nO’SHAUGHNESSY, JAMES, 2252 Giddings street, Chicago, son of James\r\nO’Shaughnessy of Gort and Catherine, née Mulholland; was born in St.\r\nCatherine, Mo., and educated in the parochial schools; took up the\r\nprofession of teaching and then the study of law, which he abandoned to\r\nenter newspaper work.

Mr. Olcott is of Irish descent, and was born in the\r\ncity of Buffalo. He was educated at the Brothers schools, from which he\r\ngraduated with high honors. He was gifted by nature with an unusually\r\nsweet tenor voice, and at an early age started his professional career\r\nas a ballad singer in traveling minstrel days. During these years he won\r\nhis first public recognition by his wonderful singing of favorite\r\nballads. He then went to England for a short time, where his voice won\r\npraise for its sweetness and purity. During his sojourn in England he\r\ndevoted his spare time to study. On his return he went to San Francisco\r\nand in connection with his appearances on the stage assumed the\r\nmanagement of the Standard Theatre in that city. His next step was to\r\ndesert minstrelsy and join Denman Thompson in “The Old Homestead.” After\r\nthis he became the tenor of the Duff Opera Company and the McCaull Opera\r\nCompany. At this period he determined to go to London, secure an\r\nengagement if possible and thoroughly cultivate his voice under the\r\ntuition of some good master. During Mr. Olcott’s stay in London he\r\nplayed for one year at the Lyric Theatre and one year at the Prince of\r\nWales Theatre. He returned to America under engagement to his present\r\nmanager, Mr. Augustus Pitou, to star in Irish singing light comedy\r\nrôles, making his first appearance in Mavourneen in November, 1893, at\r\nYonkers, New York. That was sixteen years ago. During these years Mr.\r\nOlcott has produced eleven plays and written more popular songs than any\r\nother song writer of the day. On September 28, 1897, Mr. Olcott was\r\nmarried to Margaret O’Donovan, of San Francisco. The union has been a\r\nmost happy and ideal one. Mr. Olcott has won for himself both fame and\r\nwealth, and what is better still, the admiration and respect of\r\nthousands of personal friends.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPHELAN, JAMES DUVAL, ex-mayor of San Francisco; born San Francisco\r\nApril, 1861; sire James Phelan, a California Pioneer; A.

The\r\nname “Rigney” is that of a French Huguenot who came with William to\r\nIreland and who was credited with the distinction of doing more than the\r\naverage of his fellows in destroying the good Irishmen who upheld the\r\ncause of Shamus (Na Hocha) at the bloody battle of Auchram. He had the\r\naward usually given his kind—a gift of the plunder of the vanquished.\r\nMany generations of Rigneys lived more or less respected in King’s\r\nCounty, where all traces of the Huguenot’s religion disappeared from\r\namongst them. The writer accompanied his father and mother, two brothers\r\nand two sisters, from Ireland to this country in October, 1868, to join\r\nfour brothers who emigrated from Ireland five years before. His family\r\nsettled in Bridgeport, Conn., November, 1868, where he lived until July,\r\n1878, working part of the time as a machinist and later as mechanical\r\nengineer and superintendent of the Pacific Iron Works of that city. In\r\n1878 he went to Havana, Cuba, where he engaged in engineering and later\r\non in sugar manufacturing. His partners in the ownership of a sugar\r\nplantation were Franklin Farrel of Ansonia, Conn., and the late Hugh\r\nKelly of New York. He greatly prizes his associations with these good\r\nmen and mourns the loss of the best of friends in the untimely end of\r\nHugh Kelly. At present he is associated with the engineering firms of\r\n“The Dyer Company” and Allis-Chalmers Company, with office at 71\r\nBroadway, New York. He is a member of the Catholic Club and the Friendly\r\nSons of St. Patrick of New York City.

O’CONNELL, PROVIDENCE, R. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Some time ago I received a copy of the 8th Volume of the American\r\n  Irish Historical Society’s records. I want at this time to apologize\r\n  for not acknowledging receipt of it before. While I have not been\r\n  asked by any publishing house to fill a 5-ft. shelf of the best\r\n  sellers, I will cheerfully recommend this book to anybody in search of\r\n  a liberal education of the Irish chapter in American History. The book\r\n  and yourself reflect credit upon one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  M. R. F. MCCARTHY, BINGHAMTON, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The purpose of this note is to acknowledge receipt of Volume Eight,\r\n  Journal of the American Irish Historical Society. It is a very\r\n  creditable work indeed and most interesting. The merits of the book\r\n  are many and I desire to thank you for my copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     J. B. SPILLANE, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The latest volume, bearing on the proceedings of the American-Irish\r\n  Historical Society, has just reached me, and I congratulate you most\r\n  heartily on its general excellence, both from literary and\r\n  typographical view-points.\r\n\r\n  These volumes have become a veritable encyclopedia of important data\r\n  bearing upon the achievements of people of Irish birth in America, and\r\n  they supplement the work of the Society in a most valuable way, for\r\n  the facts presented within the covers of these volumes will last long\r\n  after its members shall have passed away.\r\n\r\n  Up to the time the American Irish Historical Society was organized\r\n  nothing had been done in a really practical way to identify those of\r\n  Irish birth and descent with the history and development of the\r\n  Colonies and the United States outside of fugitive articles in the\r\n  daily press. But now we have a permanent record of actual\r\n  accomplishments, the value of which will grow with the years.\r\n\r\n  The members are, indeed, much indebted to the late lamented Thomas H.\r\n  Murray for the time bestowed, as well as the patience and ability\r\n  which he displayed in the compilation of these volumes, and when I say\r\n  that the volume just to hand is of equal interest and importance to\r\n  any of its predecessors little more need be said in complimenting you.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WILLIAM BEER, NEW ORLEANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I am duly in receipt of the copy of the American Irish Historical\r\n  Society Journal, Volume Eight. I thank you for it and for placing us\r\n  on your mailing list.\r\n\r\n  The section on late publications interesting to members is one of\r\n  great value and should be cultivated until it covers not only the\r\n  names of books interesting to members but of periodical articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THOMAS DWYER, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I beg to gratefully acknowledge the receipt of the Journal of the\r\n  American Irish Historical Society. I think the American Irish\r\n  Historical Society deserves great credit for the publishing of this\r\n  book, and I trust it will periodically issue such publications, as\r\n  they are most encouraging and instructive to everybody interested in\r\n  the story of Ireland and its people.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  CHARLES MCCARTHY, JR., PORTLAND, ME.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Volume Eight of the Journal of the American Irish Historical Society\r\n  was received a few days ago, for which I thank you and congratulate\r\n  you on its general arrangement and appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CLARENCE W. STOWELL, PROVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I was pleasantly surprised to find in my mail this morning a copy of\r\n  The Journal of the American Irish Historical Society, Volume Eight.\r\n  Please accept my sincere thanks for the same, and let me congratulate\r\n  you upon the very interesting volume you have compiled. I will read\r\n  its contents with great pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CARNEGIE FREE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I beg to acknowledge the receipt of—with best thanks—The Journal of\r\n  the American Irish Historical Society, Volume Eight, which shall be\r\n  duly placed in the Reference Library of this Institution. It will be\r\n  considered a great favor if your Council can see their way to donate\r\n  the seven preceding volumes to this Library, also to place the name of\r\n  this Institution on your free-list for future issues of your annual\r\n  volume.\r\n\r\n                                                  JAMES WILKINSON,\r\n                                              _Secretary and Librarian_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  WILLIAM J. KELLY, PORTSMOUTH, N. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I beg to acknowledge receipt of Volume Eight of the Journal and thank\r\n  you for the same. This is the best ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     JAMES CONNOLLY, CORONADO, CAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I thank you for Volume Eight of Journal of American Irish Historical\r\n  Society, at hand just now.\r\n\r\n  I take pleasure in tendering yourself and the Society sincere\r\n  congratulations on the excellence of this work. It shows that you and\r\n  your co-laborers in the field are fully alive and awake to the great\r\n  and salutary duties which you have in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WILLIAM J. BARRY, BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Permit me to express my appreciation of your work and the work of your\r\n  assistants in compiling the Eighth Volume of the Journal of the\r\n  American Irish Historical Society. Upon receipt of same I started to\r\n  glance it over, but spent all the afternoon and evening reading it and\r\n  found the Journal deeply interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      EDWARD J. MCGUIRE, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I want to congratulate you heartily upon the excellent work done in\r\n  the preparation of the American Irish Historical Society’s Journal. It\r\n  is a handsome volume, excellently arranged. I have looked it over\r\n  carefully. I think you can readily qualify as a member of the Authors’\r\n  Club.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 REV. GEORGE F. MAGUIRE, HARWICH, MASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I am in receipt of your Journal of the American Irish Historical\r\n  Society, for which please accept my sincere thanks. The information it\r\n  contains will add greatly to the popular knowledge of what Irishmen\r\n  have achieved, to enlarge the domain of their honest efforts in\r\n  securing for themselves recognition as potent factors in the\r\n  upbuilding of national thought and success.\r\n\r\n  I am rejoiced to accept the above mentioned Journal as an evidence of\r\n  your sterling worth, in placing before the public _names_ and _facts_\r\n  which will strengthen the claim we make for our race, of having\r\n  entered largely as a component of the many national privileges which\r\n  we enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     JAMES H. DEVLIN, JR., BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Many thanks for the Journal that you have just sent me. The Society\r\n  has good reason to be proud of its Journal and of its\r\n  Secretary-General who is responsible for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   WILLIAM J. KINSLEY, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Volume Eight of the Journal of the American Irish Historical Society\r\n  just at hand and I wish to thank you for sending it and at the same\r\n  time to congratulate you upon the makeup of the book. It is edited\r\n  with literary ability and reflects credit on you as well as to the\r\n  contributors of the various articles, and the artistic mechanical\r\n  makeup are also both very fine. It is a book that is a credit to the\r\n  organization and its circulation is bound to do much good for the\r\n  cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    JOHN D. CRIMMINS, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I have this moment received and opened Volume Eight of the Journal of\r\n  the American Irish Historical Society.\r\n\r\n  My warmest congratulations to you on this excellent production, which\r\n  is a credit to the Society. It is by far the best volume yet brought\r\n  out.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HENRY L. JOYCE, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I beg to acknowledge receipt of the Society’s annual book for the year\r\n  1909. I want to congratulate you upon the splendid work you have\r\n  turned out. It is well done, very interesting, and fully appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  JOSEPH F. O’CONNELL, M. C., BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I have received today Volume Eight of the Journal of the American\r\n  Irish Historical Society, and I wish to extend to you my compliments\r\n  on the splendid way in which it is gotten up.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 JAMES F. BRENNAN, PETERBOROUGH, N. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Volume Eight of the Journal of the American-Irish Historical Society\r\n  is at hand. It is a beautiful and worthy volume; the only one we have\r\n  had clothed as it should be. I am delighted that you have improved its\r\n  looks so much, and I congratulate you on the taste displayed; no\r\n  better style could be adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                RT. REV. JAMES MCGOLRICK, DULUTH, MINN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of Volume Eight of the Journal\r\n  of the American-Irish Historical Society.\r\n\r\n  It is a real pleasure to read a volume so interesting, so well\r\n  illustrated and so full of information. You are to be congratulated on\r\n  the excellent work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    JOHN J. LENEHAN, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I was prepared for something extra, for with you it is _nullum quod\r\n  tetegit non ornavit_, but Volume Eight of the Journal has completely\r\n  surpassed all my anticipations. It is a wonder.\r\n\r\n  It is the best book ever issued by the Society, and marks the highest\r\n  point reached in its work.\r\n\r\n  Between the pages—nay, between the very lines themselves—I see your\r\n  thought and care for every detail. Well written, carefully read,\r\n  appropriately collocated, profusely illustrated, full of information\r\n  and suggestion, the book only partly shows the wealth of labor\r\n  expended on its preparation.\r\n\r\n  No one will ever know or thoroughly realize the time you necessarily\r\n  gave to this task. The American Irish Historical Society will long\r\n  feel proud of the zeal and devotion of its distinguished\r\n  Secretary-General.\r\n\r\n  In these days of the strenuous life it may truly be said that greater\r\n  love hath no man than this, that he gives up some of his time for his\r\n  friends. This work will bear great fruit. May you long be spared.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       M. P. TULLY, NEWTON, N. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Enclosed herewith please find receipt for Volume Eight American Irish\r\n  Historical Journal, which came duly to hand on 19th inst., for which\r\n  you will accept my sincere thanks. It is intrinsically priceless to\r\n  any Irish person or a person of Irish descent if they have any regard\r\n  for their ancestors. It is one of the greatest privileges of my life\r\n  to be admitted as a member of such an organization. The work before it\r\n  will be of incalculable benefit to the Irish race. May it live long\r\n  and prosper!\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PATRICK CARTER, PROVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is indeed a great pleasure for me to thank you with all my heart\r\n  for the time you have spent and the space you have given me in The\r\n  Journal of the American Irish Historical Society, a book so well known\r\n  and so largely circulated among the good people of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     WILLIAM O’HERIN, PARSONS, KAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I beg to acknowledge receipt of Volume Eight of the Journal of the\r\n  American Irish Historical Society, and desire to express my\r\n  appreciation of its contents and the admirable manner in which it is\r\n  gotten up.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PATRICK J. MCCARTHY, PROVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Received Volume Eight, Journal of the American Irish Historical\r\n  Society, the latest and best. With grateful respect to the memory of\r\n  the pioneer editor and Secretary-General, Thomas H. Murray, I express\r\n  my admiration for your zeal, ability, industry and patriotism in the\r\n  cause as Secretary-General and as editor of Volume Eight. It will\r\n  commend the Society to the Irish race and inspire us to persevere and\r\n  will also command the respect of other races for the Irish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   JAMES L. O’NEILL, ELIZABETH, N. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Volume Eight of the American Irish Historical Society received. You\r\n  are deserving of the highest commendation from the members of the\r\n  Society. All who read the pages will readily see the compiling of the\r\n  work was an arduous task, but no doubt an extreme pleasure to you.\r\n\r\n  I trust you will be spared to the Society for many years to come, and\r\n  thus continue in the noble work of your late predecessor, and also\r\n  that your zeal will have the subservient effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   JOHN J. SLATTERY, LOUISVILLE, KY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I thank you for Volume Eight of the Society’s publications sent to me,\r\n  which came in due time, and the receipt of which I would have\r\n  acknowledged sooner, had I not been desirous of first examining its\r\n  contents.\r\n\r\n  This volume, like its predecessors, is replete with valuable historic\r\n  matter, and should be found in every well-selected library. Please\r\n  accept my thanks and best wishes for the success of the Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n Administration Expenses, 40\r\n\r\n Alexander, Hon.

A Lecture Delivered before the New York\r\n  Historical Association at Lake George, New York, 1906.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Prof. E. D. Sanborn writing of these Puritans (1 _Granite Monthly_,\r\n  34), said: “Some portion of the bigotry, intolerance and persecution\r\n  of Massachusetts Puritans migrated to New Hampshire with their laws.\r\n  The result was a few prosecutions of witches and Quakers, but no\r\n  capital convictions. After the lapse of a century some disabilities\r\n  and distraint of goods for the support of ‘the standing order’ or\r\n  clergy were inflicted on dissenters from the established creed. This\r\n  petty intolerance continued until about 1819, when the Toleration Act\r\n  became a law of New Hampshire.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  The late L. A. Morrison, of Derry, N. H., said of them (10 _Granite\r\n  Monthly_, page 249), that “They were hard-hearted, long-headed,\r\n  level-headed, uncompromising, unconquered and unconquerable\r\n  Presbyterians. They were of a stern and rugged type. They clung to the\r\n  tenets of the Presbyterian faith with a devotion, constancy and\r\n  obstinacy little short of bigotry and in it was mingled little of that\r\n  charity for others of a different faith, ‘which suffereth long,’ and\r\n  it was said of them in 1790: ‘They have a great deal of substantial\r\n  civility, without much courtesy to relieve it, and set it off to the\r\n  best advantage.’ The bold idea of rights and privileges, which seem\r\n  inseparable from their Presbyterian church, renders them apt to be\r\n  ungracious and litigious in their dealings. On the whole the middle\r\n  and lower ranks of people, in this quarter of the kingdom, are a\r\n  valuable part of the community; but one must estimate their worth as a\r\n  miner often does his ore, rather by its weight than its\r\n  splendor.”—Letters concerning the Northern Coast of the County Antrim\r\n  Island, by William Hamilton, Dublin, 1790, page 117.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  “From the notices given and extracts taken from records, it will be\r\n  seen that Presbyterianism in New England had passed its noonday, and\r\n  that its tide had begun to ebb.” History of Presbyterianism in New\r\n  England, by Alexander Blaikie, 1882, page 197. With reference to the\r\n  condition in Peterborough, it was stated: “The number of members of\r\n  the church in 1850 was 175, in 1856 their roll was reduced to 67\r\n  members and in 1859 Presbyterianism became extinct in Peterborough.”\r\n  _Ib._, page 367.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  As an instance of this evolution may be mentioned the efforts of a\r\n  very estimable lady of our town in 1896 at a church meeting, called\r\n  for the purpose, who proposed the substitution of water for wine in\r\n  the church service; the question was solemnly and prayerfully\r\n  discussed, was not voted down, but the motion was laid on the table,\r\n  where it still remains for future determination; the matter was not\r\n  decided then; possibly their progressiveness had not sufficiently\r\n  advanced. But less important questions have been the foundation of\r\n  some modern church doctrines. Who will say that this theory, advanced,\r\n  as then alleged, in the interest of temperance, may not find favor in\r\n  some new church of, so called, advanced ideas, which will profoundly\r\n  urge—as is already urged by individuals—that the wine mentioned in the\r\n  Bible was not in fact wine at all, nothing more or less than water?\r\n\r\n  A strange spectacle indeed, ten persons of only ordinary intelligence\r\n  and scholarship—who came together after a few hours’ notice—essaying\r\n  to make a corrected interpretation of the Bible and radically changing\r\n  one of the most important church dogmas which has received the\r\n  consideration and approval of the great theologians of the past;\r\n  absurd you may say, but it is in a very similar manner that many of\r\n  the churches composing the present religious medley came into\r\n  existence. Oh shades of old Presbyterianism, could your ancient\r\n  devotees but see the wanderings of their progeny in the groping for\r\n  the true path!\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  They were from an ancient race of pure Celtic (Irish) origin, whose\r\n  ancestors had emigrated from Ireland to southern Scotland, and, in\r\n  1612–20, returned to their ancestors’ former home; remaining in\r\n  Ireland over a century before the emigration to America in 1718–36. In\r\n  other words, from Ireland to Argyle (Scotland) these Irish went, to\r\n  Ireland from Scotland they returned in the seventeenth century and to\r\n  America their descendants came over a century later. Strange indeed it\r\n  is that the history of the Irish origin of these so called Scots is\r\n  suppressed by these modern “Scotch-Irish” writers. (See Vol. 2, pages\r\n  333 and 712, and Vol. 7, page 555, of Chambers Encyclopædia.)\r\n\r\n  These hardy and opinionated Celts, while in Scotland, left their\r\n  indelible and unmistakable imprint on the language and character of\r\n  the people, in the design of their humble dwellings and churches and\r\n  more pretentious round towers. In reference to the Round Towers of\r\n  Ireland, Hamilton wrote in 1790: “There have been but two buildings of\r\n  this species hitherto discovered out of Ireland; they are both in\r\n  Scotland, and the fashion of them has probably been borrowed from this\r\n  country (Ireland), where they are still extremely numerous. One of\r\n  these usually called a Pictish tower, stands at Abernethy in\r\n  Perthshire, and seems to be of very ancient date; the other is at\r\n  Brechin in Angusshire, probably much more modern than the former.”\r\n  Letters concerning the Northern Coast of the County Antrim, Ireland,\r\n  by William Hamilton, Dublin, 1790, page 62.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Rev. David Annan made a fiddle with his jackknife and would sit with\r\n  his Bible open before him and his inspiring glass standing by, and\r\n  play tunes while the children danced. His people were shocked,\r\n  however, on one occasion when he told them in one of his sermons that\r\n  “he had prayed over one bed of onions and fiddled over another to see\r\n  which would fare the best.” The result of the experiment was not\r\n  reported.—Judge Nathaniel Holmes’ Address of Oct. 24, 1889, page 23.\r\n\r\n  Jonathan Smith, a lawyer in Clinton, Mass., in his recently published\r\n  “Home of the Smith Family” on page 56, gives a description of a wake\r\n  held in Peterborough on the occasion of the death of Elizabeth Smith,\r\n  April 18, 1769, as follows: “The near relatives and neighbors\r\n  assembled in the evening to watch through the night with the body in\r\n  the dimly lighted room. The exercises began with the reading of the\r\n  Bible, followed by prayer; then words of consolation and comfort were\r\n  spoken to the mourners, and the virtue and character of the deceased\r\n  were passed in review. Soon stories of ghosts, witches and demons were\r\n  exchanged, tales of death warnings to the deceased and her friends.\r\n  Later, stimulants were freely circulated, and before morning there was\r\n  eating as well as drinking.” Mr. Parker, in speaking of the custom,\r\n  says: “The affair often ended by shouts of laughter and revelry\r\n  breaking up the company.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  It is not generally known that the Society of St. Tammany (the present\r\n  Tammany Hall) was more directly associated than any other organization\r\n  or party in securing the fight for titles of plain “Mr. President” for\r\n  the President of the United States. While not actually a member of the\r\n  St. Tammany Society, William Maclay, who was Senator from Pennsylvania\r\n  1789–1791, gave his great influence to St. Tammany by making an\r\n  address at one of its first meetings, May 12, 1790. Under this date he\r\n  records in his Journal: “This day exhibited a grotesque scene in the\r\n  streets of New York. Being the old First of May the Sons of St.\r\n  Tammany had a grand parade through the town in Indian dress. I\r\n  delivered a talk at one of their meetinghouses and went away to\r\n  dinner. There seems to be some sort of a scheme laid of erecting some\r\n  sort of order or society under this denomination, but it does not seem\r\n  well digested as yet. The expense of the dresses must have been\r\n  considerable and the money laid out on clothing might have dressed\r\n  some of their ragged beggars. But the weather is now warm.”\r\n\r\n  Without doubt Maclay was in sympathy with the democratic spirit of\r\n  this association and it was Maclay who led the successful fight\r\n  against titles and royal forms in the first session of Congress.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  The Burnham Tavern is still standing in Machias, and is now owned by\r\n  the local Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. It is\r\n  the repository of relics of the Revolution. The building is\r\n  practically the same, in appearance, as when the “O’Brien boys,” and\r\n  other Machias patriots gathered there at the opening of the War for\r\n  Independence, and discussed ways and means for the defense of their\r\n  liberties.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  From “The Liberty Pole; A Tale of Machias.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  For a detailed account of the armament of the “Margaretta,” and of the\r\n  engagement between her and the American sloop, see “Life of Captain\r\n  Jeremiah O’Brien, Machias, Me.,” by the writer of this sketch.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  According to at least one authority, the “Unity” was re-named the\r\n  “O’Brien.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Words fail me to describe my emotions, when, a few years ago, I\r\n  visited the spot where the “Margaretta” was beached by the\r\n  victory-elated young men who had wrested her from her foreign\r\n  commander and crew, a century and a quarter before.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  For an account of the capture of the “Hannibal,” see Life of Captain\r\n  Jeremiah O’Brien.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  In July, 1902, the writer of this sketch received a letter from Mr. G.\r\n  F. Dunning, of Farmington, Connecticut. From this letter I quote the\r\n  following words, which I am certain will be of deep interest to the\r\n  readers of the sketch of Captain O’Brien: “I was born in Brunswick,\r\n  Maine, in 1817, three years before Captain O’Brien removed from\r\n  Newburyport to Brunswick, in 1820. My mother, eldest of his three\r\n  daughters, was Mary O’Brien, whom my father, Robert D. Dunning,\r\n  married in 1802—just 100 years ago. I am the eighth of eleven children\r\n  and I am ‘the last leaf on the tree.’ _I remember my grandfather\r\n  distinctly_, as he died in May, 1832, when I was 15 years old.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  The above is a verbatim transcript of Mr. Wheaton’s letter, as sent me\r\n  from the Maine Historical Society a few years since.—A.
