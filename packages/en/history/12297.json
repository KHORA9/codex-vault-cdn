Frost\r\nTampa, Florida\r\nOctober 20, 1937\r\n\r\nJOSEPHINE ANDERSON\r\n\r\n\r\nHANTS\r\n\r\n\"I kaint tell nothin bout slavery times cept what I heared folks talk\r\nabout. I was too young to remember much but I recleck seein my granma\r\nmilk de cows an do de washin. Granpa was old, an dey let him do light\r\nwork, mosly fish an hunt.\r\n\r\n\"I doan member nothin bout my daddy. He died when I was a baby. My\r\nstepfather was Stephen Anderson, an my mammy's name was Dorcas. He come\r\nfum Vajinny, but my mammy was borned an raised in Wilmington. My name\r\nwas Josephine Anderson fore I married Willie Jones. I had two\r\nhalf-brothers youngern me, John Henry an Ed, an a half-sister, Elsie. De\r\nboys had to mind de calves an sheeps, an Elsie nursed de missus' baby. I\r\ndone de cookin, mosly, an helped my mammy spin.\r\n\r\n\"I was ony five year old when dey brung me to Sanderson, in Baker\r\nCounty, Florida. My stepfather went to work for a turpentine man, makin\r\nbarrels, an he work at dat job till he drop dead in de camp. I reckon he\r\nmusta had heart disease.\r\n\r\n\"I doan recleck ever seein my mammy wear shoes. Even in de winter she go\r\nbarefoot, an I reckon cold didn't hurt her feet no moran her hands an\r\nface. We all wore dresses made o' homespun. De thread was spun an de\r\ncloth wove right in our own home. My mamy an granmamy an me done it in\r\nspare time.\r\n\r\n\"My weddin dress was blue--blue for true. I thought it was de prettiest\r\ndress I ever see. We was married in de court-house, an dat be a mighty\r\nhappy day for me. Mos folks dem days got married by layin a broom on de\r\nfloor an jumpin over it. Dat seals de marriage, an at de same time\r\nbrings em good luck.\r\n\r\n\"Ya see brooms keeps hants away. When mean folks dies, de old debbil\r\nsometimes doan want em down dere in da bad place, so he makes witches\r\nout of em, an sends em back. One thing bout witches, dey gotta count\r\neverthing fore dey can git acrosst it. You put a broom acrosst your door\r\nat night an old witches gotta count ever straw in dat broom fore she can\r\ncome in.\r\n\r\n\"Some folks can jes nachly see hants bettern others. Teeny, my gal can.\r\nI reckon das cause she been borned wid a veil--you know, a caul, sumpum\r\nwhat be over some babies' faces when dey is borned. Folks borned wid a\r\ncaul can see sperrits, an tell whas gonna happen fore it comes true.\r\n\r\n\"Use to worry Teeny right smart, seein sperrits day an night. My husban\r\nsay he gonna cure her, so he taken a grain o' corn an put it in a bottle\r\nin Teeny's bedroom over night. Den he planted it in de yard, an driv\r\nplenty sticks roun da place. When it was growin good, he put leaf-mold\r\nroun de stalk, an watch it ever day, an tell us don't _nobody_ touch de\r\nstalk. It raise three big ears o' corn, an when dey was good roastin\r\nsize he pick em off an cook em an tell Teeny eat ever grain offn all\r\nthree cobs. He watch her while she done it, an she ain never been\r\nworried wid hants no more. She sees em jes the same, but dey doan bother\r\nher none.\r\n\r\n\"Fust time I ever knowed a hant to come into our quarters was when I was\r\njes big nough to go out to parties. De game what we use to play was spin\r\nde plate. Ever time I think on dat game it gives me de shivers. One time\r\nthere was a strange young man come to a party where I was. Said he name\r\nRichard Green, an he been takin keer o' horses for a rich man what was\r\ngonna buy a plantation in dat county. He look kinda slick an\r\ndressed-up--diffunt from de rest. All de gals begin to cast sheep's eyes\r\nat him, an hope he gonna choose dem when day start playin games.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty soon dey begin to play spin de plate an it come my turn fust\r\nthing. I spin it an call out 'Mister Green!' He jumps to de middle o' de\r\nring to grab de plate an 'Bang'--bout four guns go off all at oncet, an\r\nMister Green fall to de floor plum dead shot through de head.\r\n\r\n\"Fore we knowed who done it, de sheriff an some more men jump down from\r\nde loft, where dey bean hidin an tell us quit hollerin an doan be\r\nscairt. Dis man be a bad deeper--you know, one o' them outlaws what\r\nkills folks. He some kinda foreigner, an jes tryin make blieve he a\r\nniggah, so's they don't find him.\r\n\r\n\"Wall we didn't feel like playin no more games, an f'ever after dat you\r\ncoundn't git no niggahs to pass dat house alone atter dark. Dey say da\r\nplace was hanted, an if you look through de winder any dark night you\r\ncould see a man in dere spinnin de plate.\r\n\r\n\"I sho didn't never look in, cause I done seen more hants aready dan I\r\never wants to see agin. One night I was goin to my granny's house. It\r\nwas jes comin dark, an when I got to de crick an start across on de\r\nfoot-log, dere on de other end o' dat log was a man wid his haid cut off\r\nan layin plum over on his shoulder. He look at me, kinda pitiful, an\r\ndon't say a word--but I closely never waited to see what he gonna talk\r\nabout. I pure flew back home. I was so scairt I couldn't tell de folks\r\nwhat done happened till I set down an get my breath.\r\n\r\n\"Nother time, not so long ago, when I live down in Gary, I be walkin\r\ndown de railroad track soon in de mornin an fore I knowed it, dere was a\r\nwhite man walkin long side o' me. I jes thought it were somebody, but I\r\nwadn't sho, so I turn off at de fust street to git way from dere. De nex\r\nmawnin I be boin[TR: goin?] to work at de same time. It were kinda foggy\r\nan dark, so I never seen nobody till I mighty nigh run into dis same\r\nman, an dere he goes, bout half a step ahead o' me, his two hands restin\r\non his be-hind.\r\n\r\n\"I was so close up to him I could see him plain as I see you. He had\r\nfingernails dat long, all cleaned an polished. He was tull, an had on a\r\nderby hat, an stylish black clothes. When I walk slow he slow down, an\r\nwhen I stop, he stop, never oncet lookin roun. My feets make a noise on\r\nde cinders tween de rails, but he doan make a mite o' noise. Dat was de\r\nfust thing got me scairt, but I figger I better find out for sho ifen he\r\nbe a sperrit; so I say, gook an loud: 'Lookee here, Mister, I jez an old\r\ncolored woman, an I knows my place, an I wisht you wouldn't walk wid me\r\ncounta what folks might say.'\r\n\r\n\"He never looked roun no moren if I wan't there, an I cut my eyes roun\r\nto see if there is somebody I can holler to for help. When I looked back\r\nhe was gone; gone, like dat, without makin a sound. Den I knowed he be a\r\nhant, an de nex day when I tell somebody bout it dey say he be de genman\r\nwhat got killed at de crossin a spell back, an other folks has seen him\r\njus like I did. Dey say dey can hear babies cryin at de trestle right\r\nnear dere, an ain't nobody yit ever found em.\r\n\r\n\"Dat ain de ony hant I ever seen. One day I go out to de smokehouse to\r\ngit a mess o' taters. It was after sundown, but still purty light. When\r\nI gits dere de door be unlocked an a big man standin half inside. 'What\r\nyou doin stealin our taters!' I hollers at him, an pow! He gone, jes\r\nlike dat. Did I git back to dat house! We mighty glad to eat grits an\r\ncornbread dat night.\r\n\r\n\"When we livin at Titusville, I see my old mammy comin up de road jus as\r\nplain as day. I stan on de porch, fixin to run an meet her, when all of\r\na sudden she be gone. I begin to cry an tell de folks I ain't gonna see\r\nmy mammy agin. An sho nuff, I never did. She die at Sanderson, back in\r\nWest Florida, fore I got to see her.\r\n\r\n\"Does I blieve in witches? S-a-a-y, I knows more bout em den to jes\r\n'blieve'--I been _rid_ by em. Right here in dis house. You ain never\r\nbeen rid by a witch? Well, you mighty lucky. Dey come in de night,\r\nginnerly soon after you drop off to sleep. Dey put a bridle on your\r\nhead, an a bit in your mouth, an a saddle on your back. Den dey take off\r\ntheir skin an hang it up on de wall. Den dey git on you an some nights\r\ndey like to ride you to death. You try to holler but you kaint, counta\r\nthe iron bit in your mouth, an you feel like somebody holdin you down.\r\nDen dey ride you back home an into your bed. When you hit de bed you\r\njump an grab de kivers, an de witch be gone, like dat. But you know you\r\nbeen rid mighty hard, cause you all wet wid sweat, an you feel plum\r\ntired out.\r\n\r\n\"Some folks say you jus been dreamin, counta de blood stop circulatin in\r\nyaur back. Shucks! Dey ain never been rid by a witch, or dey ain sayin\r\ndat.\r\n\r\n\"Old witch docter, he want ten dollers for a piece of string, what he\r\nsay some kinda charm words over. Tells me to make a image o' dat old\r\nwitch outa dough, an tie dat string roun its neck; den when I bake it in\r\nde oven, it swell up an de magic string shet off her breath. I didn't\r\nhave no ten dollar, so he say ifen I git up five dollar he make me a\r\nhand--you know, what collored folks cals a jack. Dat be a charm what\r\nwill keep de witches away. I knows how to make em, but day doan do no\r\ngood thout de magic words, an I doan know dem. You take a little pinch\r\no' dried snake skin an some graveyard dirt, an some red pepper an a\r\nlock o' your hair wrapped roun some black rooster feathers. Den you spit\r\nwhiskey on em an wrap em in red flannel an sew if into a ball bout dat\r\nbig. Den you hang it under your right armpit, an ever week you give it a\r\ndrink o' whiskey, to keep it strong an powful.\r\n\r\n\"Dat keep de witches fum ridin you; but nary one o' dese charms work wid\r\ndis old witch. I got a purty good idee who she is, an she got a charm\r\npowfuller dan both of dem. But she kaint git acrosst flaxseed, not till\r\nshe count ever seed. You doan blieve dat? Huh! I reckon I knows--I done\r\ntried it out. I gits me a lil bag o' pure fresh flaxseed, an I sprinkle\r\nit all roun de bed; den I put some on top of da mattress, an under de\r\nsheet. Den I goes to bed an sleeps like a baby, an dat old witch doan\r\nbother me no more.\r\n\r\n\"Ony oncet. Soon's I wake up, I light me a lamp an look on de floor an\r\ndere, side o' my bed was my dress, layin right over dat flaxseed, so's\r\nshe could walk over on de dress, big as life. I snatch up de dress an\r\nthrow it an de bed; den I go to sleep, an I ain _never_ been bothered no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"Some folks reads de Bible backwards to keep witches fum ridin em, but\r\ndat doan do me no good, cause I kaint read. But flaxseed work so good I\r\ndoan be studyin night-ridin witches no more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nRachel A. Austin, Field Worker\r\nJohn A. Simms, Editor\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nOctober 27, 1936\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SIMEON ANDREWS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor almost 30 years Edward Waters College, an African Methodist\r\nEpiscopal School, located on the north side of Kings Road in the western\r\nsection of Jacksonville, has employed as watchman, Samuel Simeon Andrews\r\n(affectionately called \"Parson\"), a former slave of A.J. Lane of\r\nGeorgia, Lewis Ripley of Beaufort, South Carolina, Ed Tillman of Dallas,\r\nTexas, and John Troy of Union Springs, Alabama.\r\n\r\n\"Parson\" was born November 18, 1850 in Macon, Georgia, at a place called\r\nTatum Square, where slaves were held, housed and sold. \"Speculators\"\r\n(persons who traveled from place to place with slaves for sale) had\r\nhoused 84 slaves there--many of whom were pregnant women. Besides\r\n\"Parson,\" two other slave-children, Ed Jones who now lives in Sparta,\r\nGeorgia, and George Bailey were born in Tatum Square that night. The\r\nmorning after their births, a woman was sent from the nearby A.J. Lane\r\nplantation to take care of the three mothers; this nurse proved to be\r\n\"Parson's\" grandmother. His mother told him afterwards that the meeting\r\nof mother and daughter was very jubilant, but silent and pathetic,\r\nbecause neither could with safety show her pleasure in finding the\r\nother. At the auction which was held a few days later, his mother,\r\nRachel, and her two sons, Solomon Augustus and her infant who was later\r\nto be known as \"Parson,\" were purchased by A.J. Lane who had previously\r\nbought \"Parson's\" father, Willis, from a man named Dolphus of Albany,\r\nGeorgia; thus were husband and wife re-united. They were taken to Lane's\r\nplantation three miles out of Sparta, Georgia, in Hancock County. Mr.\r\nLane owned 85 slaves and was known to be very kind and considerate.\r\n\r\n\"Parson\" lived on the Lane plantation until he was eight years old, when\r\nhe was sold to Lewis Ripley of Beaufort, South Carolina, with whom he\r\nlived for two years; he was then sold to Ed Tillman of Dallas, Texas; he\r\nstayed on the Tillman plantation for about a year and until he was\r\npurchased by John Troy of Union Springs, Alabama--the richest\r\nslave-holder in Union Springs, Alabama; he remained with him until\r\nEmancipation. He recalls that during one of these sales about $800.00\r\nwas paid for him.\r\n\r\nHe describes A.J. Lane as being a kind slave-holder who fed his slaves\r\nwell and whipped them but little. All of his other masters, he states,\r\nwere nice to children, but lashed and whipped the grown-ups.\r\n\r\nMr. Lane's family was comprised of his wife, Fannie (who also was very\r\nkind to the slaves) five children, Harriett Ann, Jennie, Jeff, Frankie\r\nand Mae Roxie, a brother (whose name he does not recall) who owned a few\r\nslaves but was kind to those that he did own. Although very young during\r\nslavery, \"Parson\" remembers many plantation activities and customs,\r\namong which are the following: That the master's children and those of\r\nthe slaves on the plantation played together; the farm crops consisted\r\nof corn, cotton, peas, wheat and oats; that the food for the slaves was\r\ncooked in pots which were hung over a fire; that the iron ovens used by\r\nthe slaves had tops for baking; how during the Civil War, wheat, corn\r\nand dried potatoes were parched and used as substitutes for coffee; that\r\nhis mother was given a peck of flour every two weeks; that a mixture of\r\nsalt and sand was dug from the earthern floor of the smokehouse and\r\nwater poured over it to get the salt drippings for seasoning; that most\r\nmedicine consisted of boiled roots; when thread and cloth were dyed with\r\nthe dye obtained from maple bark; when shoes were made on a wooden last\r\nand soles and uppers fastened together with maple pegs; when the white\r\npreachers preached \"obey your masters\"; that the first buggy that he saw\r\nwas owned by his master, A.J. Lane; it had a seat at the rear with rest\r\nwhich was usually occupied by a man who was called the \"waiter\"; there\r\nwas no top to the seat and the \"waiter\" was exposed to the weather. He\r\nrecalls when wooden slats and tightened ropes were used for bed springs;\r\nalso the patience of \"Aunt Letha\" an old woman slave who took care of\r\nthe children in the neighborhood while their parents worked, and how\r\nthey enjoyed watching \"Uncle Umphrey\" tan cow and pig hides.\r\n\r\n\"Parson\" describes himself as being very frisky as a boy and states that\r\nhe did but very little work and got but very few whippings. Twice he ran\r\naway to escape being whipped and hid in asparagus beds in Sparta,\r\nGeorgia until nightfall; when he returned the master would not whip him\r\nbecause he was apprehensive that he might run away again and be stolen\r\nby poorer whites and thus cause trouble. The richer whites, he relates,\r\nwere afraid of the poorer whites; if the latter were made angry they\r\nwould round up the owners' sheep and turn them loose into their cotton\r\nfields and the sheep would eat the cotton, row by row.\r\n\r\nHe compares the relationship between the rich and poor whites during\r\nslavery with that of the white and Negro people of today.\r\n\r\nWith a face full of frowns, \"Parson\" tells of a white man persuading his\r\nmother to let him tie her to show that he was master, promising not to\r\nwhip her, and she believed him. When he had placed her in a buck (hands\r\ntied on a stick so that the stick would turn her in any direction) he\r\nwhipped her until the blood ran down her back.\r\n\r\nWith changed expression he told of an incident during the Civil War:\r\nSlaves, he explained had to have passes to go from one plantation to\r\nanother and if one were found without a pass the \"patrollers\" would pick\r\nhim up, return him to his master and receive pay for their service. The\r\n\"patrollers\" were guards for runaway slaves. One night they came to Aunt\r\nRhoda's house where a crowd of slaves had gathered and were going to\r\nreturn them to their masters; Uncle Umphrey the tanner, quickly spaded\r\nup some hot ashes and pitched it on them; all of the slaves escaped\r\nunharmed, while all of the \"patrollers\" were badly injured; no one ever\r\ntold on Uncle Umphrey and when Aunt Rhoda was questioned by her master\r\nshe stated that she knew nothing about it but told them that the\r\n\"patrollers\" had brought another \"nigger\" with them; her master took it\r\nfor granted that she spoke the truth since none of the other Negroes\r\nwere hurt. He remembers seeing this but does not remember how he, as a\r\nlittle boy, was prevented from telling about it.\r\n\r\nAsked about his remembrance or knowledge of the slaves' belief in magic\r\nand spells he said: \"I remember this and can just see the dogs running\r\naround now. My mother's brother, \"Uncle Dick\" and \"Uncle July\" swore\r\nthey would not work longer for masters; so they ran away and lived in\r\nthe woods. In winter they would put cotton seed in the fields to rot for\r\nfertilizer and lay in it for warmth. They would kill hogs and slip the\r\nmeat to some slave to cook for food. When their owners looked for them,\r\n\"Bob Amos\" who raised \"nigger hounds\" (hounds raised solely to track\r\nNegro slaves) was summoned and the dogs located them and surrounded them\r\nin their hide-out; one went one way and one the other and escaped in the\r\nswamps; they would run until they came to a fence--each kept some\r\n\"graveyard dust and a few lightwood splinters\" with which they smoked\r\ntheir feet and jumped the fence and the dogs turned back and could track\r\nno further. Thus, they stayed in the woods until freedom, when they came\r\nout and worked for pay. Now, you know \"Uncle Dick\" just died a few years\r\nago in Sparta, Georgia.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Civil War came he remembers hearing one night \"Sherman is\r\ncoming.\" It was said that Wheeler's Cavalry of the Confederates was\r\nalways \"running and fighting.\" Lane had moved the family to Macon,\r\nGeorgia, and they lived on a place called \"Dunlap's Hill.\" That night\r\nfour preachers were preaching \"Fellow soldiers, the enemy is just here\r\nto Bolden's Brook, sixteen miles away and you may be carried into\r\njudgment; prepare to meet your God.\" While they were preaching, bombs\r\nbegan to fly because Wheeler's Cavalry was only six miles away instead\r\nof 16 miles; women screamed and children ran. Wheeler kept wagons ahead\r\nof him so that when one was crippled the other would replace it. He says\r\nhe imagines he hears the voice of Sherman now, saying: \"Tell Wheeler to\r\ngo on to South Carolina; we will mow it down with grape shot and plow it\r\nin with bombshell.\"\r\n\r\nEmancipation came and with it great rejoicing. He recalls that\r\nRepublicans were called \"Radicals\" just after the close of the Civil\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nMr. Lane was able to save all of his meat, silver, and other valuables\r\nduring the war by having a cave dug in the hog pasture; the hogs\r\ntrampled over it daily.\r\n\r\n\"Parson\" states that among the papers in his trunk he has a piece of\r\nmoney called \"shin plasters\" which was used during the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe slaves were not allowed to attend schools of any kind; and school\r\nfacilities immediately following Emancipation were very poor; when the\r\nfirst teacher, Miss Smith, a Yankee, came to Sparta, Georgia and began\r\nteaching Sunday School, all of the children were given testaments or\r\ncatechisms which their parents were afraid for them to keep lest their\r\nmasters whip them, but the teacher called on the parents and explained\r\nto them that they were as free as their former masters.\r\n\r\n\"Parson\" states that when he was born, his master named him \"Monk.\" His\r\ngrandfather, Willis Andrews, who was a free man of Pittsburg,\r\nPennsylvania, purchased the freedom of his wife Lizzie, but was never\r\nable to purchase their four children; his father, also named Willis,\r\ndied a slave, was driven in an ox-cart to a hole that had been dug, put\r\nin it and covered up; his mother nor children could stop work to attend\r\nthe funeral, but after the Emancipation, he and a brother returned,\r\nfound \"Uncle Bob\" who helped bury him and located his grave. Soon after\r\nhe had been given his freedom, \"Parson\" walked from Union Springs,\r\nAlabama where his last master had taken him--back to Macon, Georgia, and\r\nrejoined his mother, Rachel, his brothers, Samuel Augustus, San\r\nFrancisco, Simon Peter, Lewis, Carter, Powell Wendell and sisters,\r\nLizzie and Ann; they all dropped the name of their master, Lane, and\r\ntook the name of their grandfather, Andrews.\r\n\r\n\"Parson\" possesses an almost uncanny memory and attributes it to his\r\ninability to write things down and therefore being entirely dependent\r\nupon his memory. He had passed 30 years of age and had two children who\r\ncould read and write before he could. His connection with Edward Waters\r\nCollege has given him a decided advantage for education and there are\r\nfew things that he cannot discuss intelligently. He has come in contact\r\nwith thousands of students and all of the ministers connected with the\r\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church in the State of Florida and has\r\nattended all of the State and General Conferences of this Church for the\r\npast half century. He has lived to be 85 years of age and says he will\r\nlive until he is 106. This he will do because he claims: \"Your life is\r\nin your hand\" and tells these narratives as proof:\r\n\r\n\"In 1886 when the present Atlantic Coast Line Railroad was called the\r\nS.F.W. and I was coming from Savannah to Florida, some tramps intent\r\nupon robbery had removed spikes from the bridge and just as the alarm\r\nwas given and the train about to be thrown from the track, I raised the\r\nwindow and jumped to safety. I then walked back two miles to report it.\r\nMore than 70 were killed who might have been saved had they jumped as I\r\ndid. As a result, the S.F. and W. gave me a free pass for life with\r\nwhich I rode all over the United States and once into Canada.\" He\r\nproudly displays this pass and states that he would like to travel over\r\nthe United States again but that the school keeps him too close.\r\n\r\n\"I had been very sick but took no medicine; my wife went out to visit\r\nSister Nancy--shortly afterwards I heard what sounded like walking, and\r\nin my imagination saw death entering, push the door open and draw back\r\nto leap on me; I jumped through the window, my shirt hung, but I pulled\r\nit out. Mr. Hodges, a Baptist preacher was hoeing in his garden next\r\ndoor, looked at me and laughed. A woman yelled 'there goes Reverend\r\nAndrews, and death is on him.' I said 'no he isn't on me but he's down\r\nthere.' Pretty soon news came that Reverend Hodges had dropped dead.\r\nDeath had come for someone and would not leave without them. I was weak\r\nand he tried me first. Reverend Hodges wasn't looking, so he slipped up\r\non him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Parson\" came to Umatilla, Florida, in 1882 from Georgia with a Mr.\r\nRogers brought him and six other men, their wives and children, to work\r\non the railroad; he was made the section \"boss\" which job he held until\r\na white man threatened to \"dock\" him because he was wearing a stiff\r\nshirt and \"setting over a white man\" when he should have a shovel. This\r\nwas the opinion of a man in the vicinity, but another white friend,\r\nnamed Javis warned him and advised him not to leave Umatilla, but\r\npersuaded him to work for him cutting cord wood; although \"Parson\" had\r\nnever seen wood corded, he accepted the job and was soon given a pass to\r\nMacon, Georgia, to get other men; he brought 13 men back and soon became\r\ntheir \"boss\" and bought a house and decided to do a little hunting. When\r\nhe left this job he did some hotel work, cooked and served as train\r\nporter. In 1892 he was ordained to preach and has preached and pastored\r\nregularly from that time up to two years ago.\r\n\r\nHe is of medium size and build and partially bald-headed; what little\r\nhair he has is very grey; he has keen eyes; his eyesight is very good;\r\nhe has never had to wear glasses. He is as supple as one half his age;\r\nit is readily demonstrated as he runs, jumps and yells while attending\r\nthe games of his favorite pastimes, baseball and football. Wherever the\r\nEdward Waters College football team goes, there \"Parson\" wants to go\r\nalso. Whenever the crowd at a game hears the scream \"Come on boys,\"\r\neveryone knows it is \"Parson\" Andrews.\r\n\r\n\"Parson\" has had two wives, both of whom are dead, and is the father of\r\neight children: Willis (deceased) Johnny, Sebron Reece of Martin,\r\nTennessee, Annie Lee, of Macon, Georgia, Hattie of Jacksonville, Ella\r\n(deceased) Mary Lou Rivers of Macon, Georgia, and Augustus\r\nsomewhere-at-sea.\r\n\r\n\"Parson\" does not believe in taking medicine, but makes a liniment with\r\nwhich he rubs himself. He attributes his long life to his sense of\r\n\"having quitting sense\" and not allowing death to catch him unawares. He\r\nasserts that if he reaches the bedside of a kindred in time, he will\r\nkeep him from dying by telling him: \"Come on now, don't be crazy and\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\nHe states that he enjoyed his slavery life and since that time life has\r\nbeen very sweet. He knows and remembers most of the incidents connected\r\nwith members of the several Conferences of the African Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church in Florida and can tell you in what minutes you may\r\nfind any of the important happenings of the past 30 or 40 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1.

He says that he does not know his age,\r\ndoes not remember ever having heard it. But he must be pretty old, he\r\nsays, \"'cause I was a right smart size when Mistuh Smith went off to\r\nfight.\" He thinks he may be over a hundred--and he looks it--but he is\r\nnot sure.\r\n\r\nAustin was born between Greene and Hancock Counties, on the Oconee\r\nRiver, in Georgia. He uses the names of the counties interchangeably; he\r\ncannot be definite as to just which one was his birthplace. \"The line\r\nbetween 'em was right there by us,\" he says.\r\n\r\nHis father was Jack; for want of a surname of his own he took that of\r\nhis father and called himself Jack Smith. During a temporary shortage of\r\nfunds on his master's part, Jack and Bill's mother was sold to a planter\r\nin the northern part of the state. It was not until long after his\r\nemancipation that Bill ever saw either of them again.\r\n\r\nBill's father Jack was regarded as a fairly good carpenter, mason and\r\nbricklayer; at times his master would let him do small jobs of repairing\r\nof building for neighboring planters. These jobs sometimes netted him\r\nhams, bits of cornmeal, cloth for dresses for his wife and children, and\r\nother small gifts; these he either used for his small family or\r\nbartered with the other slaves. Sometimes he sold them to the slaves for\r\nmoney; cash was not altogether unknown among the slaves on the Smith\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAustin gives an interesting description of his master, Thomas Smith. He\r\nsays that \"sumptimes he was real rich and all of us had a good time. The\r\nwuk wasn't hard then, cause if we had big crops he would borrow some\r\nhe'p from the other white folks. He used to give us meat every day, and\r\nplenty of other things. One time he bought all of us shoes, and on\r\nSunday night would let us go to wherever the preacher was holdin'\r\nmeeting. He used to give my papa money sumptimes, too.\r\n\r\n\"But they used to whisper that he would gamble a lot. We used to see a\r\nwhole lot of men come up to the house sumptimes and stay up most of the\r\nnight. Sumptimes they would stay three or four days. And once in a while\r\nafter one of these big doings Mistuh Smith would look worried, and we\r\nwouldn't get no meat and vary little of anything else for a long time.\r\nHe would be crabby and beat us for any little thing. He used to tell my\r\npapa that he wouldn't have a d--- cent until he made some crops.\"\r\n\r\nA few years before he left to enter the war the slave owner came into\r\npossession of a store near his plantation. This store was in Greensboro.\r\nEither because the business paid or because of another of his economic\r\n'bad spells', ownership of his plantation passed to a man named Kimball\r\nand most of the slaves, with the exception of Bill Austin and one or two\r\nwomen--either transferred with the plantation or sold. Bill was kept to\r\ndo errands and general work around the store.\r\n\r\nBill learned much about the operation of the store, with the result that\r\nwhen Mr. Smith left with the Southern Army he left his wife and Bill to\r\ncontinue its operation. By this time there used to be frequent stories\r\nwhispered among the slaves in the neighborhood--and who came with their\r\nmasters into the country store--of how this or that slave ran away, and\r\nwith the white man-power of the section engaged in war, remained at\r\nlarge for long periods or escaped altogether.\r\n\r\nThese stories always interested Austin, with the result that one morning\r\nhe was absent when Mrs. Smith opened the store. He remained away 'eight\r\nor nine days, I guess', before a friend of the Smiths found him near\r\nMacon and threatened that he would 'half kill him' if he didn't return\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nEither the threat--or the fact that in Macon there were no readily\r\navailable foodstuffs to be eaten all day as in the store--caused Austin\r\nto return. He was roundly berated by his mistress, but finally forgiven\r\nby the worried woman who needed his help around the store more than she\r\nneeded the contrite promises and effusive declarations that he would\r\n'behave alright for the rest of his life.'\r\n\r\nAnd he did behave; for several whole months. But by this tine he was 'a\r\ngreat big boy', and he had caught sight of a young woman who took his\r\nfancy on his trip to Macon. She was free herself; her father had bought\r\nher freedom with that of her mother a few years before, and did odd jobs\r\nfor the white people in the city for a livelihood. Bill had thoughts of\r\ngoing back to Macon, marrying her, and bringing her back 'to work for\r\nMissus with me.' He asked permission to go, and was refused on the\r\ngrounds that his help was too badly needed at the store. Shortly\r\nafterward he had again disappeared.\r\n\r\n'Missus', however, knew too much of his plans by this time, and it was\r\nno difficult task to have him apprehended in Macon. Bill may not have\r\nhad such great objections to the apprehension, either, he says, because\r\nby this time he had learned that the young woman in Macon had no\r\nslightest intention to give up her freedom to join him at Greensboro.\r\n\r\nA relative of Mrs. Smith gave Austin a sound beating on his return; for\r\na time it had the desired effect, and he stayed at the store and gave no\r\nfurther trouble. Mrs. Smith, however, thought of a surer plan of keeping\r\nhim in Greensboro; she called him and told him he might have his\r\nfreedom. Bill never attempted to again leave the place--although he did\r\nnot receive a cent for his work--until his master had died, the store\r\npassed into the hands of one of Mr. Smith's sons, and the emancipation\r\nof all the slaves was a matter of eight or ten years' history!\r\n\r\nWhen he finally left Greene and Hancock Counties--about fifty-five years\r\nago, Austin settled in Jackson County. He married and began the raising\r\nof a family. At present he has nineteen living children, more\r\ngrandchildren than he can accurately tell, and is living with his third\r\nwife, a woman in her thirties.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n1.

Interview with subject, near Greenwood, Florida, (Rural Route 2,\r\nSneads)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nPearl Randolph, Field Worker\r\nJohn A. Simms, Editor\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nAugust 18, 1936\r\n\r\nFRANK BERRY\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Berry, living at 1614 west Twenty-Second street, Jacksonville,\r\nFlorida, claims to be a grandson of Osceola, last fighting chief of the\r\nSeminole tribe. Born in 1858 of a mother who was part of the human\r\nchattel belonging to one of the Hearnses of Alachua County in Florida,\r\nhe served variously during his life as a State and Federal Government\r\ncontractor, United States Marshal (1881), Registration Inspector (1879).\r\n\r\nBeing only eight years of age when the Emancipation Proclamation was\r\nissued, he remembers little of his life as a slave. The master was kind\r\nin an impersonal way but made no provision for his freedmen as did many\r\nother Southerners--usually in the form of land grants--although he gave\r\nthem their freedom as soon as the proclamation was issued. Berry learned\r\nfrom his elders that their master was a noted duelist and owned several\r\nfine pistols some of which have very bloody histories.\r\n\r\nIt was during the hectic days that followed the Civil War that Berry\r\nserved in the afore-mentioned offices. He held his marshalship under a\r\nJudge King of Jacksonville, Florida. As State and Federal Government\r\nContractor he built many public structures, a few of which are still in\r\nuse, among them the jetties at Mayport, Florida which he helped to build\r\nand a jail at High Springs, Florida.\r\n\r\nIt was during the war between the Indians and settlers that Berry's\r\ngrandmother, serving as a nurse at Tampa Bay was captured by the Indians\r\nand carried away to become the squaw of their chief; she was later\r\nre-captured by her owners. This was a common procedure, according to\r\nBerry's statements. Indians often captured slaves, particularly the\r\nwomen, or aided in their escape and almost always intermarried with\r\nthem. The red men were credited with inciting many uprisings and\r\nwholesale escapes among the slaves.\r\n\r\nCountry frolics (dances) were quite often attended by Indians, whose\r\nmain reason for going was to obtain whiskey, for which they had a very\r\nstrong fondness. Berry describes an intoxicated Indian as a \"tornado mad\r\nman\" and recalls a hair raising incident that ended in tragedy for the\r\noffender.\r\n\r\nA group of Indians were attending one of these frolics at Fort Myers\r\nand everything went well until one of the number became intoxicated,\r\nterrorizing the Negroes with bullying, and fighting anyone with whom he\r\ncould \"pick\" a quarrel. \"Big Charlie\" an uncle of the narrator was\r\npresent and when the red man challenged him to a fight made a quick end\r\nof him by breaking his neck at one blow.\r\n\r\nFor two years he was hounded by revengeful Indians, who had an uncanny\r\nway of ferreting out his whereabouts no matter where he went. Often he\r\nsighted them while working in the fields and would be forced to flee to\r\nsome other place. This continued with many hairbreadth escapes, until he\r\nwas forced to move several states away.\r\n\r\nBerry recalls the old days of black aristocracy when Negroes held high\r\npolitical offices in the state of Florida, when Negro tradesmen and\r\nprofessionals competed successfully and unmolested with the whites. Many\r\nfortunes were made by men who are now little more than beggars. To this\r\ngroup belongs the man who in spite of reduced circumstances manages\r\nstill to make one think of top hats and state affairs. Although small of\r\nstature and almost disabled by rheumatism, he has the fiery dignity and\r\nstraight back that we associate with men who have ruled others. At the\r\nsame time he might also be characterized as a sweet old person, with all\r\nthe tender reminiscences of the old days and the and childish\r\nprejudices against all things new. As might be expected, he lives in the\r\npast and always is delighted whenever he is asked to tell about the only\r\nlife that he has ever really lived. Together with his aged wife he lives\r\nwith his children and is known to local relief agencies who supplement\r\nthe very small income he now derives from what is left of what was at\r\none time a considerable fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\nPersonal interview with subject, Frank Berry, 1614 West Twenty-Second\r\nStreet, Jacksonville, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORIDA FOLKLORE\r\nSLAVE CUSTOMS AND ANECDOTES\r\n\r\nMARY MINUS BIDDIE\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Minus Biddie, age one hundred five was born in Pensacola, Florida,\r\n1833, and raised in Columbia County. She is married, and has several\r\nchildren. For her age she is exceptionally active, being able to wash\r\nand do her house work. With optimism she looks forward to many more\r\nyears of life. Her health is excellent.\r\n\r\nHaving spent thirty-two years of her life as a slave she relates vividly\r\nsome of her experiences.\r\n\r\nHer master Lancaster Jamison was a very kind man and never mistreated\r\nhis slaves. He was a man of mediocre means, and instead of having a\r\nlarge plantation as was usual in those days, he ran a boarding house,\r\nthe revenue therefrom furnishing him substance for a livelihood. He had\r\na small farm from which fresh produce was obtained to supply the needs\r\nof his lodgers. Mary's family were his only slaves. The family consisted\r\nof her mother, father, brother and a sister. The children called the old\r\nmaster \"Fa\" and their father \"Pappy.\" The master never resented this\r\nappellation, and took it in good humor. Many travelers stopped at his\r\nboarding house; Mary's mother did the cooking, her father \"tended\" the\r\nfarm, and Mary, her brother and sister, did chores about the place.\r\nThere was a large one-room house built in the yard in which the family\r\nlived. Her father had a separate garden in which he raised his produce,\r\nalso a smokehouse where the family meats were kept. Meats were smoked\r\nin order to preserve them.\r\n\r\nDuring the day Mary's father was kept so busy attending his master's\r\nfarm that there was no time for him to attend to a little farm that he\r\nwas allowed to have. He overcame this handicap, however, by setting up\r\nhuge scaffolds in the field which he burned and from the flames that\r\nthis fire emitted he could see well enough to do what was necessary to\r\nhis farm.\r\n\r\nThe master's first wife was a very kind woman; at her death Mary's\r\nmaster moved from Pensacola to Columbia County.\r\n\r\nMary was very active with the plow, she could handle it with the agility\r\nof a man. This prowess gained her the title of \"plow girl.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOKING.\r\n\r\nStoves were unknown and cooking was done in a fireplace that was built\r\nof clay, a large iron rod was built in across the opening of the\r\nfireplace on which were hung pots that had special handles that fitted\r\nabout the rod holding them in place over the blazing fire as the food\r\ncooking was done in a moveable oven which was placed in the fireplace\r\nover hot coals or corn cobs. Potatoes were roasted in ashes. Oft' times\r\nMary's father would sit in front of the fireplace until a late hour in\r\nthe night and on arising in the morning the children would find in a\r\ncorner a number of roasted potatoes which their father had thoughtfully\r\nroasted and which the children readily consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHTING SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nMatches were unknown; a flint rock and a file provided the fire. This\r\noccured by striking a file against a flint rock which threw off sparks\r\nthat fell into a wad of dry cotton used for the purpose. This cotton, as\r\na rule, readily caught fire. This was fire and all the fire needed to\r\nstart any blaze.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAVING.\r\n\r\nThe white folk wove the cloth on regular looms which were made into\r\ndresses for the slaves. For various colors of cloth the thread was dyed.\r\nThe dye was made by digging up red shank and wild indigo roots which\r\nwere boiled. The substance obtained being some of the best dye to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEVERAGES & FOOD.\r\n\r\nBread was made from flour and wheat. The meat used was pork, beef,\r\nmutton and goat. For preservation it was smoked and kept in the\r\nsmokehouse. Coffee was used as a beverage and when this ran out as oft'\r\ntimes happened, parched peanuts were used for the purpose.\r\n\r\nMary and family arose before daybreak and prepared breakfast for the\r\nmaster and his family, after which they ate in the same dining room.\r\nWhen this was over the dishes were washed by Mary, her brother and\r\nsister. The children then played about until meals were served again.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHING and SOAP.\r\n\r\nWashing was done in home-made wooden tubs, and boiling in iron pots\r\nsimilar to those of today. Soap was made from fat and lye.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMUSEMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe only amusement to be had was a big candy pulling, or hog killing and\r\nchicken cooking. The slaves from the surrounding plantations were\r\nallowed to come together on these occasions. A big time was had.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCH.\r\n\r\nThe slaves went to the \"white folks\" church on Sundays. They were seated\r\nin the rear of the church. The white minister would arise and exhort the\r\nslaves to 'mind your masters, you owe them your respect.' An old\r\nChristian slave who perceived things differently could sometimes be\r\nheard to mumble, \"Yeah, wese jest as good as deys is only deys white and\r\nwe's black, huh.\" She dare not let the whites hear this. At times\r\nmeetin's were held in a slave cabin where some \"inspired\" slave led the\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nIn the course of years Mr. Jamison married again. His second wife was a\r\nveritable terror. She was always ready and anxious to whip a slave for\r\nthe least misdemeanor. The master told Mary and her mother that before\r\nhe would take the chance of them running away on account of her meanness\r\nhe would leave her. As soon as he would leave the house this was a\r\nsignal for his wife to start on a slave. One day, with a kettle of hot\r\nwater in her hand, she chased Mary, who ran to another plantation and\r\nhid there until the good master returned. She then poured out her\r\ntroubles to him. He was very indignant and remonstrated with his wife\r\nfor being so cruel. She met her fate in later years; her son-in-law\r\nbecoming angry at some of her doings in regard to him shot her, which\r\nresulted in her death. Instead of mourning, everybody seemed to rejoice,\r\nfor the menace to well being had been removed. Twice a year Mary's\r\nfather and master went to Cedar Keys, Florida to get salt. Ocean water\r\nwas obtained and boiled, salt resulting. They always returned with about\r\nthree barrels of salt.\r\n\r\nThe greatest event in the life of a slave was about to occur, and the\r\nmost sorrowful in the life of a master, FREEDOM was at hand. A Negro was\r\nseen coming in the distance, mounted upon a mule, approaching Mr.\r\nJamison who stood upon the porch. He told him of the liberation of the\r\nslaves. Mr. Jamison had never before been heard to curse, but this was\r\none day that he let go a torrent of words that are unworthy to appear in\r\nprint. He then broke down and cried like a slave who was being lashed by\r\nhis cruel master. He called Mary's mother and father, Phyliss and Sandy,\r\n\"I ain't got no more to do with you, you are free,\" he said, \"if you\r\nwant to stay with me you may and I'll give you one-third of what you\r\nraise.\" They decided to stay. When the crop was harvested the master did\r\nnot do as he had promised. He gave them nothing. Mary slipped away,\r\nmounted the old mule \"Mustang\" and galloped away at a mules snail speed\r\nto Newnansville where she related what had happened to a Union captain.\r\nHe gave her a letter to give to Mr. Jamison. In it he reminded him that\r\nif he didn't give Mary's family what he had promised he would be put in\r\njail. Without hesitation the old master complied with these pungent\r\norders.\r\n\r\nAfter this incident Mary and her family left the good old boss to seek a\r\nnew abode in other parts. This was the first time that the master had in\r\nany way displayed any kind of unfairness toward them, perhaps it was the\r\nreaction to having to liberate them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nThere was no marriage during slavery according to civil or religious\r\ncustom among the slaves. If a slave saw a woman whom he desired he told\r\nhis master. If the woman in question belonged on another plantation, the\r\nmaster would consult her master: \"one of my boys wants to marry one of\r\nyour gals,\" he would say. As a rule it was agreeable that they should\r\nlive together as man and wife. This was encouraged for it increased the\r\nslave population by new borns, hence, being an asset to the masters.\r\nThe two slaves thus joined were allowed to see one another at intervals\r\nupon special permission from the master. He must have a pass to leave\r\nthe plantation. Any slave caught without one while off the plantation\r\nwas subject to be caught by the \"paderollers\" (a low class of white who\r\nroved the country to molest a slave at the least opportunity. Some of\r\nthem were hired by the masters to guard against slaves running away or\r\nto apprehend them in the event that they did) who would beat them\r\nunmercifully, and send them back to the plantation from whence they\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this form of matrimony at emancipation there were no\r\nslaves lawfully married. Orders were given that if they preferred to\r\nlive together as man and wife they must marry according to law. They\r\nwere given nine months to decide this question, after which if they\r\ncontinued to live together they were arrested for adultery. A Mr. Fryer,\r\nJustice of the Peace at Gainesville, was assigned to deal with the\r\nsituation around the plantation where Mary and her family lived. A big\r\nsupper was given, it was early, about twenty-five slave couples\r\nattended. There was gaiety and laughter. A barrel of lemonade was\r\nserved. A big time was had by all, then those couples who desired to\r\nremain together were joined in wedlock according to civil custom. The\r\nparty broke up in the early hours of the morning.\r\n\r\nMary Biddie, cognizant of the progress that science and invention has\r\nmade in the intervening years from Emancipation and the present time,\r\ncould not help but remark of the vast improvement of the lighting system\r\nof today and that of slavery. There were no lamps or kerosene. The first\r\nthread that shearer spun was for a wick to be used in a candle, the only\r\nmeans of light. Beef tallow was used to make the candle; this was placed\r\nin a candle mould while hot. The wick was then placed in the center of\r\nthe tallow as it rest in the mould; this was allowed to cool. When this\r\nchemical process occured there was a regular sized candle to be used\r\nfor lighting.\r\n\r\nMary now past the century mark, her lean bronze body resting in a\r\nrocker, her head wrapped in a white 'kerchief, and puffing slowly on her\r\nclay pipe, expressed herself in regard to presidents: \"Roosevelt has\r\ndon' mo' than any other president, why you know ever since freedom they\r\nbeen talkin' 'bout dis pension, talkin' 'bout it tha's all, but you see\r\nMr. Roosevelt he don' com' an' gived it tu us. What? I'll say he's a\r\ngood rightus man, an' um sho' go' vot' fo' him.\"\r\n\r\nResiding in her little cabin in Eatonville, Florida, she is able to\r\nsmile because she has some means of security, the Old Age Pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, FOLKLORE\r\nEx-Slaves\r\n\r\nREV. ELI BOYD\r\n\r\n\r\nReverend Eli Boyd was born May 29, 1864, four miles from Somerville,\r\nSouth Carolina on John Murray's plantation. It was a large plantation\r\nwith perhaps one hundred slaves and their families. As he was only a\r\ntiny baby when freedom came, he had no \"recomembrance\" of the real\r\nslavery days, but he lived on the same plantation for many years until\r\nhis father and mother died in 1888.\r\n\r\n\"I worked on the plantation just like they did in the real slavery days,\r\nonly I received a small wage. I picked cotton and thinned rice. I always\r\ndid just what they told me to do and didn't ever get into any trouble,\r\nexcept once and that was my own fault.\r\n\r\n\"You see it was this way. They gave me a bucket of thick clabber to take\r\nto the hogs. I was hungry and took the bucket and sat down behind the\r\nbarn and ate every bit of it. I didn't know it would make me sick, but\r\nwas I sick? I swelled up so that I all but bust. They had to doctor on\r\nme. They took soot out of the chimney and mixed it with salt and made me\r\ntake that. I guess they saved my life, for I was awful sick.\r\n\r\n\"I never learned to read until I was 26 years old. That was after I left\r\nthe plantation. I was staying at a place washing dishes for Goodyear's\r\nat Sapville, Georgia, six miles from Waycross. I found a Webster's\r\nspelling book that had been thrown away, and I learned to read from\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't converted until I went to work in a turpentine still and five\r\nyears later I was called to preach. I am one of thirteen children and\r\nnone of us has ever been arrested. We were taught right.\r\n\r\n\"I kept on preaching until I came to Miami. I have been assistant pastor\r\nat Bethel African Methodist Church for the past ten years.\r\n\r\n\"I belong to a class of Negroes called Geechees. My grandfather was\r\nbrought directly from Africa to Port Royal, South Carolina. My\r\ngrandmother used to hold up her hand and look at it and sing out of her\r\nhand. She'd make them up as she would look at her hand. She sang in\r\nGeechee and also made rhymes and songs in English.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nCora Taylor\r\nFrances H. Miner, Editor\r\nMiami, Florida\r\n\r\nRIVANA BOYNTON [TR: also reported as Riviana.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Where, and about when, were you born?\r\n\r\nSome time in 1850 on John and Mollie Hoover's plantation between\r\nSavannah and Charleston near the Georgia line.\r\n\r\n2. If you were born on a plantation or farm, what sort of farming\r\nsection was it in?\r\n\r\nThey raised rice, corn wheat, and lots of cotton, raised everything they\r\net--vegetables, taters and all that.\r\n\r\n3. How did you pass the time as a child? What sort of chores did you do\r\nand what did you play?\r\n\r\nI had to thin cotton in the fields and mind the flies at the table. I\r\nchased them with a fly bush, sometimes a limb from a tree and sometimes\r\nwid a fancy bush.\r\n\r\n4. Was your master kind to you?\r\n\r\nYes, I was favored by being with my massy.\r\n\r\n5. How many slaves were there on the same plantation and farm?\r\n\r\nI don't know. There was plenty o' dem up in de hundreds, I reckon.\r\n\r\n6. Do you remember what kind of cooking utensils your mother used?\r\n\r\nYes, dey had spiders an' big iron kettles that dey hung in de chimney by\r\na long chain. When dey wanted to cook fast dey lowered de chain and when\r\ndey wanted to bake in the spiders, they's put them under de kettle can\r\ncover with coals until dey was hot. Dey'd put de pones in does double\r\nconcerned spiders and turn them around when dey was done on one side.\r\n\r\n7. What were your main foods and how were they cooked?\r\n\r\nWe had everything you could think of to eat.\r\n\r\n8. Do you remember making imitation or substitute coffee by grinding up\r\ncorn or peanuts?\r\n\r\nNo. We had real coffee.\r\n\r\n9. Do you remember ever having, when you were young, any other kind of\r\nbread besides corn bread?\r\n\r\nYes, batter and white bread.\r\n\r\n10. Do you remember evaporating sea water to get salt?\r\n\r\n[TR: word illegible] did hit dat way.\r\n\r\n11. When you were a child, what sort of stove do you remember your\r\nmother having? Did they have a hanging pot in the fire place, and did\r\nthey make their candles of their own tallow?\r\n\r\nAlways had fireplaces or open fires on the plantation, but after a long\r\ntime while my massy had hearth stoves to cook on. De would give us\r\nslaves pot liquor to cook green in sometimes. Dey lit de fires with\r\nflint and steel, when it would go out. We all ate with wooden paddles\r\nfor spoons. We made dem taller candles out of beef and mutton tallow,\r\nden we'd shoog 'em down into the candle sticks made of tin pans wid a\r\nhandle on and a holder for the candle in the center. You know how.\r\n\r\n12. Did you use an open well or pump to get the water?\r\n\r\nWe had a well with two buckets on a pulley to draw the water.\r\n\r\n13. Do you remember when you first saw ice in regular form?\r\n\r\nNo. Ice would freeze in winter in our place.\r\n\r\n14. Did your family work in the rice fields or in the cotton on the\r\nfarm, or what sort of work did they do?\r\n\r\nThey did all kinds of work in the fields.\r\n\r\n15. If they worked in the house or about the place, what sort of work\r\ndid they do?\r\n\r\nI was house maid and did everything they told me to do. Sometimes I'd\r\nsweep and work around all the time.\r\n\r\n16. Do you remember ever helping tan and cure hides and pig hides?\r\n\r\nThis was done on the plantation. I took no part in it.\r\n\r\n17. As a young person what sort of work did you do? If you helped your\r\nmother around the house or cut firewood or swept the yard, say so.\r\n\r\nI helped do the housework and did what the mistress told me do.\r\n\r\n18. When you were a child do you remember how people wove cloth, or spun\r\nthread, or picked out cotton seed, or weighed cotton or what sort of bag\r\nwas used on the cotton bales?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n19. Do you remember what sort of soap they used? How did they get the\r\nlye for making the soap?\r\n\r\nYes, I'd help to make the ash lye and soft soap. Never seed and cake\r\nsoap until I came here.\r\n\r\n20. What did they use for dyeing thread and cloth and how did they dye\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nThey used indigo for blue, copperas for yellow, and red oak chips for\r\nred.\r\n\r\n21. Did your mother use big, wooden washtubs with cut-out holes on each\r\nside for the fingers?\r\n\r\nYes, and dey had smaller wooden keels. Never seed any tin tubs up there.\r\n\r\n22. Do you remember the way they made shoes by hand in the country?\r\n\r\nYes, they made all our shoes on the plantation.\r\n\r\n23. Do you remember saving the chicken feathers and goose feathers\r\nalways for your featherbeds?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n23. Do you remember when women wore hoop [TR: illegible] in their skirts\r\nand when they stopped wearing them and wore narrow skirts?\r\n\r\nYes. My missus, she made me a pair of hoops, or I guess she bought it,\r\nbut some of the slaves took thin limbs from trees and made their hoops.\r\nOthers made them out of stiff paper and others would starch their skirts\r\nstiff with rice starch to make their skirts stand way out. We thought\r\nthose hoops were just the thing for style.\r\n\r\n25. Do you remember when you first saw your first windmill?\r\n\r\nYes. They didn't have them there.\r\n\r\n26. Do you remember when you first saw bed springs instead of bed ropes?\r\n\r\nI slept in a gunny bunk. My missus had a rope bed and she covered the\r\nropes with a cow hide. We made hay and corn shuck mattresses for her.\r\nWe'd cut the hay and shucks up fine and stuff the ticks with them. The\r\ncow hides were placed on top of the mattresses to protect them.\r\n\r\n27. When did you see the first buggy and what did it look like?\r\n\r\nIt was a buggy like you see.\r\n\r\n28. Do you remember your grandparents?\r\n\r\nNo. My mother was sold from me when I was small. I stayed in my uncle's\r\nshed at night.\r\n\r\n29. Do you remember the money called \"shin-plasters\"?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n30. What interesting historical events happened during your youth, such\r\nas Sherman's army passing through your section? Did you witness the\r\nhappenings and what was the reaction of the other Negroes to them?\r\n\r\nI remember well when de war was on. I used to turn the big corn sheller\r\nand sack the shelled corn for the Confederate soldiers. They used to\r\nsell some of the corn and they gave some of it to the soldiers. Anyway\r\nthe Yankees got some and they did not expect them to get it. It was this\r\nway: The Wheeler boys came through there ahead of Sherman's Army. Now,\r\nwe thought the Wheeler boys were Confederates. They came down the road\r\nas happy as could be, a-singin'\r\n\r\n  \"Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah\r\n  Hurrah for the Broke Book Boys\r\n  Hurrah for the Broke Brook Boys of South Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nSo of course we thought they were our soldiers a-singin' our songs.\r\nWell, they came an' tol' our boss that Sherman's soldiers were coming'\r\nand we'd better hide all our food and valuable things, for they'd take\r\neverything they wanted. So we \"hoped\" our Massy hide the tings. They dug\r\nholes and buried the potatoes and covered them with cotton seed and all\r\nthat. Then our ma say give dem food and thanked them for their kindness\r\nand he set out wid two of the girls to tote them to safety, but before\r\nhe got back after the missus the Yanks were on us.\r\n\r\nOur missus had od[TR:?] led us together and told us what to say. \"Now\r\nyou beg for me. If they ask you whether I've been good to you, you tell\r\n'em 'yes'. If they ask you if we give you meat, you say 'yes'.\" Now de\r\nres' didn't git any meat, but I did, 'cause I worked in the house. So I\r\ndidn't tell a lie, for I did git meat.\r\n\r\nSo we begged, an' we say, \"Our missus is good. Don't you kill her. Don't\r\nyou take our meat away from us. Don't you hurt her. Don't you burn her\r\nhouse down.\" So they burned the stable and some of the other buildings,\r\nbut they did not burn the house nor hurt us any. We saw the rest of the\r\nYanks comin'. They never stopped for nothin'. Their horses would jump\r\nthe worn rail fences and they come 'cross fields 'n everything. They\r\nbound our missus upstairs so she couldn't get away, then they came to\r\nthe sheds and we begged and begged for her. Then they loosed her, but\r\nthey took some of us for refugees and some of the slaves went off with\r\nthem of their own will. They took all the things that were buried all\r\nthe hams and everything they wanted. But they did not burn the house and\r\nour missus was saved.\r\n\r\n31. Did you know any Negroes who enlisted or joined the northern army?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n32. Did you know any Negroes who enlisted in the southern army?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n33. Did your master join the confederacy? What do you remember of his\r\nreturn from the war? Or was he wounded and killed?\r\n\r\nYes. Two boys went. One was killed and one came back.\r\n\r\n34. Did you live in Savannah when Sherman and the Northern forces\r\nmarched through the state, and do you remember the excitement in your\r\ntown or around the plantation where you lived?\r\n\r\nWe lived north of Savannah. I don't know how far it was, but it was in\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\n35. Did your master's house get robbed or burned during the time of\r\nSherman's march?\r\n\r\nWe were robbed, but the house was not burned. We saved it for them.\r\n\r\n36. What kind of uniforms did they wear during the civil war?\r\n\r\nBlue and gray\r\n\r\n37. What sort of medicine was used in the days just after the war?\r\nDescribe a Negro doctor of that period.\r\n\r\nShe used to make tea out of the Devil's Shoe String that grew along on\r\nthe ground. We used oil and turpentine. Put turpentine on sores.\r\n\r\n38. What do you remember about northern people or outside people moving\r\ninto the community after the war?\r\n\r\nYes. Mrs. Dermont, she taught white folks. I didn't go to school.\r\n\r\n39. How did your family's life compare after Emancipation with it\r\nbefore?\r\n\r\nI had it better and so did the rest.\r\n\r\n40. Do you know anything about political meetings and clubs formed after\r\nthe war?\r\n\r\nYou had to have a ticket to go to church or the paddle rollers.\r\n\r\n41. Do you know anything regarding the letters and stories from Negroes\r\nwho migrated north after the war?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n42. Were there any Negroes of your acquaintance who were skilled\r\n[TR: illegible] particular line of work?\r\n\r\nYes. In making shoes and furniture, they had to do most everything well\r\nor get paddled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nAlfred Farrell, Field Worker\r\nMonticello, Florida\r\nJanuary 12, 1937\r\n\r\nMATILDA BROOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOVERNOR'S SLAVES\r\n\r\nMatilda Brooks, 79, who lives in Monticello, Fla., was once a slave of a\r\nSouth Carolina governor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brooks was born in 1857 or 1858 in Edgefield, S.C. Her parents were\r\nHawkins and Harriet Knox, and at the time of the birth of their daughter\r\nwere slaves on a large plantation belonging to Governor Frank Pickens.\r\nOn this plantation were raised cotton, corn, potatoes, tobacco, peas,\r\nwheat and truck products. As soon as Matilda was large enough to go into\r\nthe fields she helped her parents with the farming.\r\n\r\nThe former slave describes Governor Pickens as being 'very good' to his\r\nslaves. He supervised them personally, although official duties often\r\nmade this difficult. He saw to it that their quarters were comfortable\r\nand that they always had sufficient food. When they became ill he would\r\nhimself doctor on them with pills, castor oil, turpentine other\r\nremedies. Their diet consisted largely of potatoes, corn bread, syrup,\r\ngreens, peas, and occasionally ham, fowl and other meats or poultry.\r\nTheir chief beverage was coffee made from parched corn.\r\n\r\nSince there were no stoves during slavery, they cooked their foods in\r\nlarge iron pots suspended from racks built into the fireplaces. Fried\r\nfoods were prepared in iron 'spiders', large frying pans with legs.\r\nThese pans were placed over hot coals, and the seasoning was done with\r\nsalt which they secured from evaporated sea-water. After the food was\r\nfried and while the coals were still glowing the fat of oxen and sheep\r\nwas melted to make candles. Any grease left over was put into a large\r\nbox, to be used later for soap-making.\r\n\r\nLye for the soap was obtained by putting oak ashes in a barrel and\r\npouring water over them. After standing for several days--until the\r\nashes had decayed--holes were drilled into the bottom of the barrell\r\nand the liquid drained off. This liquid was the lye, and it was then\r\ntrickled into the pot into which the fat had been placed. The two were\r\nthen boiled, and after cooling cut into squares of soap.\r\n\r\nWater for cooking and other purposes was obtained from a well, which\r\nalso served as a refrigerator at times. Matilda does not recall seeing\r\nice until many years later.\r\n\r\nIn the evenings Matilda's mother would weave cloth on her spinning-jenny\r\nand an improvised loom. This cloth was sometimes dyed in various colors:\r\nblue from the indigo plant; yellow from the crocus and brown from the\r\nbark of the red oak. Other colors were obtained from berries and other\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIn seasons other than picking-time for the cotton the children were\r\nusually allowed to play in the evenings, when cotton crops were large,\r\nhowever, they spent their evenings picking out seeds from the cotton\r\nbolls, in order that their parents might work uninterruptedly in the\r\nfields during the day. The cotton, after being picked and separated,\r\nwould be weighed in balances and packed tightly in 'crocus' bags.\r\n\r\nChicken and goose feathers were jealously saved during these days. They\r\nwere used for the mattresses that rested on the beds of wooden slats\r\nthat were built in corners against the walls. Hoop skirts were worn at\r\nthe time, but for how long afterward Matilda does not remember. She only\r\nrecalls that they were disappearing 'about the time I saw a windmill for\r\nthe first time'.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the Yankee soldiers created much excitement among the\r\nslaves on the Pickens plantation. The slaves were in ignorance of\r\nactivities going on, and of their approach, but when the first one was\r\nsighted the news spread 'just like dry grass burning up a hill'. Despite\r\nthe kindness of Governor Pickens the slaves were happy to claim their\r\nnew-found freedom. Some of them even ran away to join the Northern\r\narmies before they were officially freed. Some attempted to show their\r\nloyalty to their old owners by joining the southern armies, but in this\r\nsection they were not permitted to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter she was released from slavery Matilda came with her parents to the\r\nMonticello section, where the Knoxes became paid house servants. The\r\nparents took an active part in politics in the section, and Matilda was\r\nsent to school. White teachers operated the schools at first, and were\r\nlater replaced by Negro teachers. Churches were opened with Negro\r\nministers in the pulpits, and other necessities of community life\r\neventually came to the vicinity.\r\n\r\nMatilda still lives in one of the earlier homes of her parents in the\r\narea, now described as 'Rooster-Town' by its residents. The section is\r\nin the eastern part of Monticello.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nInterview with subject, Matilda Brooks; \"Rooster-Town\", eastern part of\r\ncity, Monticello, Jefferson County, Fla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nAlfred Farrell, Field Worker\r\nJohn A. Simms, Editor\r\nTitusville, Florida\r\nSeptember 25, 1936\r\n\r\nTITUS I. BYNES\r\n\r\n\r\nTitus B. [TR: Titus I. above] Bynes, affectionately known as \"Daddy\r\nBynes\", is reminiscent of Harriet Beecher Stowe's immortal \"Uncle Tom\"\r\nand Joel Chandler Harris' inimitable 'Uncle Remus' with his white beard\r\nand hair surrounding a smiling black face. He was born in November 1846\r\nin what is now Clarendon County, South Carolina. Both his father, Cuffy,\r\nand mother, Diana, belonged to Gabriel Flowden who owned 75 or 80 slaves\r\nand was noted for his kindness to them.\r\n\r\nBynes' father was a common laborer, and his mother acted in the capacity\r\nof chambermaid and spinner. They had 12 children, seven boys--Abraham,\r\nTutus[TR:?], Reese, Lawrence, Thomas, Billie, and Hamlet--and five\r\ngirls--Charity, Chrissy, Fannie, Charlotte, and Violet.\r\n\r\nWhen Titus was five or six years of age he was given to Flowden's wife\r\nwho groomed him for the job of houseboy. Although he never received any\r\neducation, Bynes was quick to learn. He could tell the time of day and\r\ncould distinguish one newspaper from another. He recalled an incident\r\nwhich happened when he was about eight years of age which led him to\r\nconceal his precociousness. One day while writing on the ground, he\r\nheard his mistress' little daughter tell her mother that he was writing\r\nabout water. Mistress Flowden called him and told him that if he were\r\ncaught writing again his right arm would be cut off. From then on his\r\nprecociousness vanished. In regards to religion, Bynes can recall the\r\nSunday services very vividly; and he tells how the Negroes who were\r\nseated in the gallery first heard a sermon by the white minister and\r\nthen after these services they would gather on the main floor and hear a\r\nsermon by a Negro preacher.\r\n\r\nBynes served in the Civil War with his boss, and he can remember the\r\nregiment camp between Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina.\r\nHis mistress would not permit Bynes to accompany his master to Virginia\r\nto join the Hampton Legion on the grounds that it was too cold for him.\r\nAnd thus ended his war days! When he was 20 years of age, his father\r\nturned him loose. Young Bynes rented 14 acres of land from Arthur Harven\r\nand began farming.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 he left South Carolina and came to Florida. He settled in\r\nEnterprise (now Benson Springs), Velusia County where he worked for J.C.\r\nHayes, a farmer, for one year, after which he homesteaded. He next\r\nbecame a carpenter and, as he says himself, \"a jack of all trades and\r\nmaster of none.\" He married shortly after coming to Florida and is the\r\nfather of three sons--\"as my wife told me,\" he adds with a twinkle in\r\nhis eyes. His wife is now dead. He was prevailed upon while very ill to\r\nenter the Titusville Poor Farm where he has been for almost two years.\r\n(2)\r\n\r\n\r\nDella Bess Hilyard (\"Aunt Bess\")\r\n\r\nDella Bess Hilyard, or \"Aunt Bess\" as she is better known, was born in\r\nDarlington, South Carolina in 1858, the daughter of Resier and Zilphy\r\nHart, slaves of Gus Hiwards. Both her parents were cotton pickers and as\r\na little girl Della often went with her parents into the fields. One day\r\nshe stated that the Yankees came through South Carolina with Knapsacks\r\non their shoulders. It wasn't until later that she learned the reason.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if she received any educational training, \"Aunt Bess\" replied\r\nin the negative, but stated that the slaves on the Hiwards plantation\r\nwere permitted to pick up what education they could without fear of\r\nbeing molested. No one bothered, however, to teach them anything.\r\n\r\nIn regards to religion, \"Aunt Bess\" said that the slaves were not told\r\nabout heaven; they were told to honor their masters and mistresses and\r\nof the damnation which awaited them for disobedience.\r\n\r\nAfter slavery the Hart family moved to Georgia where Della grew into\r\nwomanhood and at an early age married Caleb Bess by whom she had two\r\nchildren. After the death of Bess, about fifteen years ago, \"Aunt Bess\"\r\nmoved to Fort Pierce, Florida. While there she married Lonny Hilyard\r\nwho brought her to Titusville where she now resides, a relic of bygone\r\ndays. (3)\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor Gilbert\r\n\r\nTaylor Gilbert was born in Shellman, Georgia, 91 years ago, of a colored\r\nmother and a white father, \"which is why I am so white\", he adds. He has\r\nnever been known to have passed as white, however, in spite of the fact\r\nthat he could do so without detection. David Ferguson bought Jacob\r\nGilbert from Dr. Gilbert as a husband for Emily, Taylor's mother. Emily\r\nhad nine children, two by a white man, Frances and Taylor, and seven by\r\nJacob, only three of whom Gilbert remembers--Gettie, Rena, and Annis.\r\nTwo of these children were sent to school while the others were obliged\r\nto work on the plantation. Emily, the mother, was the cook and washwoman\r\nwhile Jacob was the Butler.\r\n\r\nGilbert, a good sized lad when slavery was at its height, recalls\r\nvividly the cruel lashings and other punishments meted out to those who\r\ndisobeyed their master or attempted to run away. It was the custom of\r\nslaves who wished to go from one plantation to another to carry passes\r\nin case they were stopped as suspected runaways. Frequently slaves would\r\nvisit without benefit of passes, and as result they suffered severe\r\ntorturing. Often the sons of the slaves' owners would go \"nigger\r\nhunting\" and nothing--not even murder was too horrible for them to do to\r\nslaves caught without passes. They justified their fiendish acts by\r\nsaying the \"nigger tried to run away when told to stop.\"\r\n\r\nGilbert cannot remember when he came to Florida, but he claims that it\r\nwas many years ago. Like the majority of Negroes after slavery, he\r\nbecame a farmer which occupation he still pursues. He married once but\r\n\"my wife got to messin' around with another man so I sent her home to\r\nher mother.\" He can be found in Miami, Florida, where he may be seen\r\ndaily hobbling around on his cane.

Her mother Tempy, belonged to Bullock, while her father Arnold\r\nMerritt, belonged to Edward Merritt, a large plantation owner. According\r\nto Patience, her mother's owner was very kind, her father's very cruel.\r\nBullock had very few slaves, but Merritt had a great many of them, not a\r\nfew of whom he sold at the slave markets.\r\n\r\nPatience spent most of her time playing in the sand when she was a\r\nchild, while her parents toiled in the fields for their respective\r\nowners. Her grandparents on her mother's side belonged to Bullock, but\r\nof her father's people she knew nothing as \"they didn't come to this\r\ncountry.\" When asked where they lived, she replied \"in South Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nSince she lived with her mother, Patience fared much better than had she\r\nlived with her father. Her main foods included meats, greens, rice, corn\r\nbread which was replaced by biscuits on Sunday morning. Coffee was made\r\nfrom parched corn or meal and was the chief drink. The food was cooked\r\nin large iron pots and pans in an open fireplace and seasoned with salt\r\nobtained by evaporating sea water.\r\n\r\nWater for all purposes was drawn from a well. In order to get soap to\r\nwash with, the cook would save all the grease left from the cooking. Lye\r\nwas obtained by mixing oak ashes with water and allowing them to decay;\r\nTubs were made from large barrels.\r\n\r\nWhen she was about seven or eight, Patience assisted other children\r\nabout her age and older in picking out cotton seeds from the picked\r\ncotton. After the cotton was weighed on improved scales, it was bound in\r\nbags made of hemp.\r\n\r\nSpinning and weaving were taught Patience when she was about ten.\r\nAlthough the cloth and thread were dyed various colors, she knows only\r\nhow blue was obtained by allowing the indigo plant to rot in water and\r\nstraining the result.\r\n\r\nPatience's father was not only a capable field worker but also a\r\nfinished shoemaker. After tanning and curing his hides by placing them\r\nin water with oak bark for several days and then exposing them to the\r\nsun to dry, he would cut out the uppers and the soles after measuring\r\nthe foot to be shod. There would be an inside sole as well as an outside\r\nsole tacked together by means of small tacks made of maple wood. Sewing\r\nwas done on the shoes by means of flax thread.\r\n\r\nPatience remembers saving the feathers from all the fowl to make feather\r\nbeds. She doesn't remember when women stopped wearing hoops in their\r\nskirts nor when bed springs replaced bed ropes. She does remember,\r\nhowever, that these things were used.\r\n\r\nShe saw her first windmill about 36 years ago, ten years before she went\r\nblind. She remembers seeing buggies during slavery time, little light\r\ncarriages, some with two wheels and some with four. She never heard of\r\nany money called \"shin-plasters,\" and she became money-conscious during\r\nthe war when Confederate currency was introduced. When the slaves were\r\nsick, they were given castor oil, turpentine and medicines made from\r\nvarious roots and herbs.\r\n\r\nPatience's master joined the confederacy, but her father's master did\r\nnot. [Although Negroes could enlist in the Southern army if they\r\ndesired,] none of them wished to do so but preferred to join northern\r\nforces and fight for the thing they desired most, freedom. When freedom\r\nwas no longer a dream, but a reality, the Merritts started life on their\r\nown as farmers. Twelve-year old Patience entered one of the schools\r\nestablished by the Freedmen's Bureau.

Interesting also is\r\nthe fact that Florida was not a slave even though she was a product\r\nof those turbulent days. Many years before her birth--March 1,\r\n1854--Florida's great grandfather, a white man, came to Tallahassee,\r\nFlorida from Washington, District of Columbia, with his children whom he\r\nhad by his Negro slave. On coming to Florida, he set all of his children\r\nfree except one boy, Amos, who was sold to a Major Ward. For what reason\r\nthis was done, no one knew. Florida, named for the state in which she\r\nwas born, was one of seven children born to Charlotte Morris (colored)\r\nwhose father was a white man and David Clayton (white).\r\n\r\nFlorida, in a retrogressive mood, can recall the \"nigger hunters\" and\r\n\"nigger stealers\" of her childhood days. Mr. Nimrod and Mr. Shehee, both\r\nwhite, specialized in catching runaway slaves with their trained\r\nbloodhounds. Her parents always warned her and her brothers and sisters\r\nto go in someone's yard whenever they saw these men with their dogs lest\r\nthe ferocious animals tear them to pieces. In regards to the \"nigger\r\nstealers,\" Florida tells of a covered wagon which used to come to\r\nTallahassee at regular intervals and camp in some secluded spot. The\r\nchildren, attracted by the old wagon, would be eager to go near it, but\r\nthey were always told that \"Dry Head and Bloody Bones,\" a ghost who\r\ndidn't like children, was in that wagon. It was not until later years\r\nthat Florida and the other children learned that the driver of the wagon\r\nwas a \"nigger stealer\" who stole children and took them to Georgia to\r\nsell at the slave markets.\r\n\r\nWhen she was 11 years old, Florida saw the surrender of Tallahassee to\r\nthe Yankees. Three years later she came to Jacksonville to live with her\r\nsister. She married but is now divorced after 12 years of marriage.\r\n\r\nThree years ago she entered the Old Folks Home at 1627 Franklin Street\r\nto live.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Personal Interview with Florida Clayton, 1627 Franklin Street,\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nViola B. Muse, Field Worker\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nDecember 3, 1936\r\n\r\n\"FATHER\" CHARLES COATES\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Father\" Charles Coates, as he is called by all who know him, was born a\r\nslave, 108 years ago at Richmond, Virginia, on the plantation of a man\r\nnamed L'Angle. His early boyhood days was spent on the L'Angle place\r\nfilled with duties such as minding hogs, cows, bringing in wood and such\r\nlight work. His wearing apparel consisted of one garment, a shirt made\r\nto reach below the knees and with three-quarter sleeves. He wore no\r\nshoes until he was a man past 20 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe single garment was worn summer and winter alike and the change in\r\nthe weather did not cause an extra amount of clothes to be furnished for\r\nthe slaves. They were required to move about so fast at work that the\r\nheat from the body was sufficient to keep them warm.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles was still a young man Mr. L'Angle sold him on time payment\r\nto W.B. Hall; who several years before the Civil War moved from Richmond\r\nto Washington County, Georgia, carrying 135 grown slaves and many\r\nchildren. Mr. Hall made Charles his carriage driver, which kept him from\r\nhard labor. Other slaves on the plantation performed such duties as rail\r\nsplitting, digging up trees by the roots and other hard work.\r\n\r\nCharles Coates remembers vividly the cruelties practiced on the Hall\r\nplantation. His duty was to see that all the slaves reported to work on\r\ntime. The bell was rung at 5:30 a.m. by one of the slaves. Charles had\r\nthe ringing of the bell for three years; this was in addition to the\r\ncarriage driving. He tells with laughter how the slaves would \"grab a\r\npiece of meat and bread and run to the field\" as no time was allowed to\r\nsit and eat breakfast. This was a very different way from that of the\r\nmaster he had before, as Mr. L'Angle was much better to his slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. Hall was different in many ways from Mr. L'Angle, \"He was always\r\npretending\" says Charles that he did not want his slaves beaten\r\nunmercifully. Charles being close to Mr. Hall during work hours had\r\nopportunity to see and hear much about what was going on at the\r\nplantation. And he believes that Mr. Hall knew just how the overseer\r\ndealt with the slaves.\r\n\r\nOn the Hall plantation there was a contraption, similar to a gallows,\r\nwhere the slaves were suspended and whipped. At the top of this device\r\nwere blocks of wood with chains run through holes and high enough that a\r\nslave when tied to the chains by his fingers would barely touch the\r\nground with his toes. This was done so that the slave could not shout or\r\ntwist his body while being whipped. The whipping was prolonged until the\r\nbody of the slave covered with welts and blood trickled down his naked\r\nbody. Women were treated in the same manner, and a pregnant woman\r\nreceived no more leniency than did a man. Very often after a severe\r\nflogging a slave's body was treated to a bath of water containing salt\r\nand pepper so that the pain would be more lasting and aggravated. The\r\nwhipping was done with sticks and a whip called the \"cat o' nine tails,\"\r\nmeaning every lick meant nine. The \"cat o' nine tails\" was a whip of\r\nnine straps attached to a stick; the straps were perforated so that\r\neverywhere the hole in the strap fell on the flesh a blister was left.\r\n\r\nThe treatment given by the overseer was very terrifying. He relates how\r\na slave was put in a room and locked up for two and three days at a time\r\nwithout water or food, because the overseer thought he hadn't done\r\nenough work in a given time.\r\n\r\nAnother offense which brought forth severe punishment was that of\r\ncrossing the road to another plantation. A whipping was given and very\r\noften a slave was put on starvation for a few days.\r\n\r\nOne privilege given slaves on the plantation was appreciated by all and\r\nthat was the opportunity to hear the word of God. The white people\r\ngathered in log and sometimes frame churches and the slaves were\r\npermitted to sit about the church yard on wagons and on the ground and\r\nlisten to the preaching. When the slaves wanted to hold church they had\r\nto get special permission from the master, and at that time a slave hut\r\nwas used. A white Preacher was called in and he would preach to them not\r\nto steal, lie or run away and \"be sure and git all dem weeds outen dat\r\ncorn in de field and your master will think a heap of you.\" Charles does\r\nnot remember anything else the preacher told them about God. They\r\nlearned more about God when they sat outside the church waiting to drive\r\ntheir masters and family back home.\r\n\r\nCharles relates an incident of a slave named Sambo who thought himself\r\nvery smart and who courted the favor of the master. The neighboring\r\nslaves screamed so loudly while being whipped that Sambo told his master\r\nthat he knew how to make a contraption which, if a slave was put into\r\nwhile being whipped would prevent him from making a noise. The device\r\nwas made of two blocks of wood cut to fit the head and could be fastened\r\naround the neck tightly. When the head was put in, the upper and lower\r\nparts were clamped together around the neck so that the slave could not\r\nscream. The same effect as choking. The stomach of the victim was placed\r\nover a barrel which allowed freedom of movement. When the lash was\r\nadministered and the slave wiggled, the barrel moved.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that Sambo was the first to be put into his own\r\ninvention for a whipping. The overseer applied the lash rather heavily,\r\nand Sambo was compelled to wiggle his body to relieve his feelings. In\r\nwiggling the barrel under his stomach rolled a bit straining Sambo's\r\nneck and breaking it. After Sambo died from his neck being broken the\r\nmaster discontinued the use of the device, as he saw the loss of\r\nproperty in the death of slaves.\r\n\r\nCharles was still a carriage driver when freedom came. He had\r\nopportunity to see and hear many things about the master's private life.\r\nWhen the news of the advance of the Union Army came, Mr. Hall carried\r\nhis money to a secluded spot and buried it in an iron pot so that the\r\nsoldiers who were confiscating all the property and money they could,\r\nwould not get his money. The slave owners were required to notify the\r\nslaves that they were free so Mr. Hall sent his son Sherard to the\r\ncabins to notify all the slaves to come into his presence and there he\r\nhad his son to tell them that they were free. The Union soldiers took\r\nmuch of the slave owners' property and gave to the slaves telling them\r\nthat if the owners' took the property back to write and tell them about\r\nit; the owners only laughed because they knew the slaves could not read\r\nnor write. After the soldiers had gone the timid and scared slaves gave\r\nup most of the land; some few however, fenced in a bit of land while the\r\nsoldiers remained in the vicinity and they managed to keep a little of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nMany of the slaves remained with the owners. There they worked for small\r\nmonthly wages and took whatever was left of cast off clothing and food\r\nand whatever the \"old missus\" gave them. A pair of old pants of the\r\nmaster was highly prized by them.\r\n\r\nCharles Coates was glad to be free. He had been well taken care of and\r\nlooked younger than 37 years of age at the close of slavery. He had not\r\nbeen married; had been put upon the block twice to be sold after\r\nbelonging to Mr. Hall. Each time he was offered for sale, his master\r\nwanted so much for him, and refusing to sell him on time payments, he\r\nwas always left on his master's hands. His master said \"being tall,\r\nhealthy and robust, he was well worth much money.\"\r\n\r\nAfter slavery, Charles was rated as a good worker. He at once began\r\nworking and saving his money and in a short time he had accumulated\r\n\"around $200.\"\r\n\r\nThe first sight of a certain young woman caused him to fall in love. He\r\nsays the love was mutual and after a courtship of three weeks they were\r\nmarried. The girl's mother told Charles that she had always been very\r\nfrail, but he did not know that she had consumption. Within three days\r\nafter they were married she died and her death caused much grief for\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\nHe was reluctant to bury her and wanted to continue to stand and look at\r\nher face. A white doctor and a school teacher whose names he does not\r\nremember, told him to put his wife's body in alcohol to preserve it and\r\nhe could look at it all the time. At that time white people who had\r\nplenty of money and wanted to see the faces of their deceased used this\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nA glass casket was used and the dressed body of the deceased was placed\r\nin alcohol inside the casket. Another casket made of wood held the glass\r\ncasket and the whole was placed in a vault made of stone or brick. The\r\nwalls of the vault were left about four feet above the ground and a\r\nwindow and ledge were placed in front, so when the casket was placed\r\ninside of the vault the bereaved could lean upon the ledge and look in\r\nat the face of the deceased. The wooden casket was provided with a glass\r\ntop part of the way so that the face could easily be seen.\r\n\r\nAlthough the process of preserving the body in alcohol cost $160,\r\nCharles did not regret the expense saying, \"I had plenty of money at\r\nthat time.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his wife, Charles left with his mother and father,\r\nHenrietta and Spencer Coates and went to Savannah, Georgia. He said they\r\nwere so glad to go, that they walked to within 30 miles of Savannah,\r\nwhen they saw a man driving a horse and wagon who picked them up and\r\ncarried them into Savannah. It was in that city that he met his present\r\nwife, Irene, and they were married about 1876.\r\n\r\nThere are nine grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren living and in\r\nMarch of 1936, when a party was given in honor of Father Coates' 108th\r\nbirthday, one of each of the four generations of his family were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe party was given at the Clara White Mission, 615 West Ashley Street\r\nby Ertha M.M. White. Father Coates and his wife were very much honored\r\nand each spoke encouraging words to those present. On the occasion he\r\nsaid that the cause for his long life was due to living close to nature,\r\nrising early, going to bed early and not dissipating in any way.\r\n\r\nHe can \"shout\" (jumping about a foot and a half from the floor and\r\nknocking his heels together.) He does chores about his yard; looks years\r\nyounger than he really is and enjoys good health. His hair is partly\r\nwhite; his memory very good and his chief delight is talking about God\r\nand his goodness. He has preached the gospel in his humble way for a\r\nnumber of years, thereby gaining the name of \"Father\" Coates.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1.

Muse, Field Worker\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nDecember 16, 1936\r\n\r\nIRENE COATES\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after slavery in the United States, the southern white\r\npeople found themselves without servants. Women who were accustomed to\r\nhaving a nurse, maid, cook and laundress found themselves without\r\nsufficient money to pay wages to all these. There was a great amount of\r\nwork to be done and the great problem confronting married women who had\r\nnot been taught to work and who thought it beneath their standing to\r\nsoil their hands, found it very difficult.\r\n\r\nThere were on the other hand many Negro women who needed work and young\r\ngirls who needed guidance and training.\r\n\r\nThe home and guidance of the aristocratic white people offered the best\r\nopportunity for the dependent un-schooled freed women; and it was in\r\nthis kind of home that the ex-slave child of this story was reared.\r\n\r\nIrene Coates of 2015 Windle Street, Jacksonville, Florida, was born in\r\nGeorgia about 1859. She was close to six years of age when freedom was\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nShe was one among the many Negro children who had the advantage of\r\nliving under the direct supervision of kind whites and receiving the\r\ncare which could only be excelled by an educated mother.\r\n\r\nJimmie and Lou Bedell were the names of the man and wife who saw the\r\nneed of having a Negro girl come into their home as one in the family\r\nand at the same time be assured of a good and efficient servant in years\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nWhen Irene was old enough, she became the nurse of the Bedell baby and\r\nwhen the family left Savannah, Georgia to come to Jacksonville, they\r\nbrought Irene with them.\r\n\r\nAlthough Irene was just about six years old when the Civil War ended,\r\nshe has vivid recollection of happenings during slavery. Some of the\r\nincidents which happened were told her by her slave associates after\r\nslavery ended and some of them she remembers herself.\r\n\r\nTwo incidents which she considers caused respect for slaves by their\r\nmasters and finally the Emancipation by Abraham Lincoln she tells in\r\nthis order.\r\n\r\nThe first event tells of a young, strong healthy Negro woman who\r\nknew her work and did it well. \"She would grab up two bags of\r\nguana (fertilizer) and tote 'em at one time,\" said Irene, and was never\r\nfound shirking her work. The overseer on the plantation, was very hard\r\non the slaves and practiced striking them across the back with a whip\r\nwhen he wanted to spur them on to do more work.\r\n\r\nIrene says, one day a crowd of women were hoeing in the field and the\r\noverseer rode along and struck one of the women across the back with the\r\nwhip, and the one nearest her spoke and said that if he ever struck her\r\nlike that, it would be the day he or she would die. The overseer heard\r\nthe remark and the first opportunity he got, he rode by the woman and\r\nstruck her with the whip and started to ride on. The woman was hoeing at\r\nthe time, she whirled around, struck the overseer on his head with the\r\nhoe, knocking him from his horse, she then pounced upon him and chopped\r\nhis head off. She went mad for a few seconds and proceeded to chop and\r\nmutilate his body; that done to her satisfaction, she then killed his\r\nhorse. She then calmly went to tell the master of the murder, saying\r\n\"I've done killed de overseer,\" the master replied--\"Do you mean to say\r\nyou've killed the overseer?\" she answered yes, and that she had killed\r\nthe horse also. Without hesitating, the master pointing to one of his\r\nsmall cabins on the plantation said--\"You see that house over there?\"\r\nshe answered yes--at the same time looking--\"Well\" said he, \"take all\r\nyour belongings and move into that house and you are free from this day\r\nand if the mistress wants you to do anything for her, do it if you want\r\nto.\" Irene related with much warmth the effect that incident had upon\r\nthe future treatment of the slaves.\r\n\r\nThe other incident occured in Virginia. It was upon an occasion when\r\nMrs. Abraham Lincoln was visiting in Richmond. A woman slaveowner had\r\none of her slaves whipped in the presence of Mrs. Lincoln. It was\r\neasily noticed that the woman was an expectant mother. Mrs. Lincoln was\r\nhorrified at the situation and expressed herself as being so, saying\r\nthat she was going to tell the President as soon as she returned to the\r\nWhite House. Whether this incident had any bearing upon Mr. Lincoln's\r\nactions or not, those slaves who were present and Irene says that they\r\nall believed it to be the beginning of the President's activities to end\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nBesides these incidents, Irene remembers that women who were not strong\r\nand robust were given such work as sewing, weaving and minding babies.\r\nThe cloth from which the Sunday clothes of the slaves was made was\r\ncalled _ausenburg_ and the slave women were very proud of this. The\r\nolder women were required to do most of the weaving of cloth and making\r\nshirts for the male slaves.\r\n\r\nWhen an old woman who had been sick, regained her strength, she was sent\r\nto the fields the same as the younger ones. The ones who could cook and\r\ntickle the palates of her mistress and master were highly prized and\r\nwere seldon if ever offered for sale at the auction block.\r\n\r\nThe slaves were given fat meat and bread made of husk of corn and wheat.\r\nThis caused them to steal food and when caught they were severely\r\nwhipped.\r\n\r\nIrene recalls the practice of blowing a horn whenever a sudden rain\r\ncame. The overseer had a certain Negro to blow three times and if\r\nshelter could be found, the slaves were expected to seek it until the\r\nrain ceased.\r\n\r\nThe master had sheds built at intervals on the plantation. These\r\naccomodated a goodly number; if no shed was available the slaves stood\r\nunder trees. If neither was handy and the slaves got wet, they could not\r\ngo to the cabins to change clothes for fear of losing time from work.\r\nThis was often the case; she says that slaves were more neglected than\r\nthe cattle.\r\n\r\nAnother custom which impressed the child-mind of Irene was the tieing of\r\nslaves by their thumbs to a tree limb and whipping them. Women and young\r\ngirls were treated the same as were men.\r\n\r\nAfter the Bedells took Irene to live in their home they traveled a deal.\r\nAfter bringing her to Jacksonville, when Jacksonville was only a small\r\nport, they then went to Camden County, Georgia.\r\n\r\nIrene married while in Georgia and came back to Jacksonville with her\r\nhusband Charles, the year of the earthquake at Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, about 1888.\r\n\r\nIrene and Charles Coates have lived in Jacksonville since that time. She\r\nrelates many tales of happenings during the time that this city grew\r\nfrom a town of about four acres to its present status.\r\n\r\nIrene is the mother of five children. She has nine grandchildren and\r\neight great-grandchildren. Her health is fair, but her eyesight is poor.\r\nIt is her delight to entertain visitors and is conversant upon matters\r\npertaining to slavery and reconstruction days.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1.

Richardson, Field Worker\r\nGrandin, Florida\r\n\r\nNEIL COKER\r\n\r\n\r\nInteresting tales of the changes that came to the section of Florida\r\nthat is situated along the Putnam-Clay County lines are told by Neil\r\nCoker, old former slave who lives two miles south of McRae on the road\r\nGrandin.\r\n\r\nCoker is the son of a slave mother and a half-Negro. His father, he\r\nstates, was Senator John Wall, who held a seat in the senate for sixteen\r\nyears. He was born in Virginia, and received his family name from an old\r\nfamily bearing the same in that state. He was born, as nearly as he can\r\nremember, about 1857.\r\n\r\nOne of Coker's first reminiscences is of the road on which he still\r\nlives. During his childhood it was known as the 'Bellamy Road,' so\r\ncalled because it was built, some 132 years ago, by a man of that name\r\nwho hailed from West Florida.\r\n\r\nThe 'Bellamy Road' was at one time the main route of traffic between\r\nTallahassee and St. Augustine. (Interestingly enough, the road is at\r\nleast 30 miles southwest of St. Augustine where it passes through\r\nGrandin; the reason for cutting it in such a wide circle, Coker says was\r\nbecause of the ferocity of the Seminoles in the swamps north and west of\r\nSt. Augustine.)\r\n\r\nWagons, carriages and stages passed along this road in the days before\r\nthe War Between the States, Coker says. In addition to these he claims\r\nto have seen many travellers by foot, and not infrequently furtive\r\nescaped slaves, the latter usually under cover of an appropriate\r\nbackground of darkness.\r\n\r\nThe road again came into considerable use during the late days of the\r\nWar. It was during these days that the Federal troops, both whites and\r\nNegroes, passed in seemingly endless procession on their way to or from\r\nencounters. On one occasion the former slave recounts having seen a\r\nprocession of soldiers that took nearly two days to pass; they travelled\r\non horse and afoot.\r\n\r\nSeveral amusing incidents are related by the ex-slave of the events of\r\nthis period. Dozens of the Negro soldiers, he says, discarded their\r\nuniforms for the gaudier clothing that had belonged to their masters in\r\nformer days, and could be identified as soldiers as they passed only\r\nwith difficulty. Others would pause on their trip at some plantation,\r\nascertain the name of the 'meanest' overseer on the place, then tie him\r\nbackward on a horse and force him to accompany them. Particularly\r\nretributive were the punishments visited upon Messrs. Mays and\r\nPrevatt--generally recognized as the most vicious slave drivers of the\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nBellamy, Coker says built the road with slave labor and as an\r\ninvestment, realizing much money on tolls on it for many years. A\r\nremarkable feature of the road is that despite its age and the fact that\r\nCounty authorities have permitted its former good grading to deterierate\r\nto an almost impassable sand at some seasons, there is no mistaking the\r\nfact that this was once a major thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nThe region that stretches from Green Cove Springs in the Northeast to\r\nGrandin in the Southwest, the former slave claims, was once dotted with\r\nlakes, creeks, and even a river; few of the lakes and none of the other\r\nbodies still exist, however.\r\n\r\nAmong the more notable of the bodies of water was a stream--he does not\r\nnow remember its name--that ran for about 20 miles in an easterly\r\ndirection from Starke. This stream was one of the fastest that the\r\nformer slave can remember having seen in Florida; its power was utilised\r\nfor the turning of a power mill which he believes ground corn or other\r\ngrain. The falls in the river that turned the water mill, he states, was\r\nat least five or six feet high, and at one point under the Falls a man\r\nnamed (or possibly nicknamed) \"Yankee\" operated a sawmill. Coker\r\nbelieves that this mill, too, derived its power from the little stream.\r\nHe says that the stream has been extinct since he reached manhood. It\r\nended in 'Scrub Pond,' beyond Grandin and Starke.\r\n\r\nSome of the names of the old lakes of the section were these: \"Brooklyn\r\nLake; Magnolia Lake; Soldier Pond (near Keystone); Half-Moon Pond, near\r\nPutnam Hall; Hick's Lake\" and others. On one of them was the large grist\r\nmill of Dr. McCray; Coker suggests that this might be the origin of the\r\ntown of McRae of the present period.\r\n\r\nTo add to its natural water facilities, Coker points out, Bradford\r\nCounty also had a canal. This canal ran from the interior of the county\r\nto the St. John's River near Green Cove Springs, and with Mandarin on\r\nthe other side of the river still a major shipping point, the canal\r\nhandled much of the commerce of Bradford and Clay Counties.\r\n\r\nCoker recalls vividly the Indians of the area in the days before 1870.\r\nThese, he claims to have been friendly, but reserved, fellows; he does\r\nnot recall any of the Indian women.\r\n\r\nNegro slaves from the region around St. Augustine and what is now\r\nHastings used to escape and use Bellamy's Road on their way to the area\r\nabout Micanopy. It was considered equivalent to freedom to reach that\r\nsection, with its friendly Indians and impenetrable forests and swamps.\r\n\r\nThe little town of Melrose probably had the most unusual name of all the\r\nstrange ones prevalent at the time. It was call, very simply,\r\n\"Shake-Rag.\" Coker makes no effort to explain the appelation.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1.

Kindness and consideration for\r\nhis slaves, made them love him.\r\n\r\nReverend Davis was rather young during his years in slavery but when he\r\nwas asked to tell something about the days of slavery, replied: \"I\r\nremember many things about slavery, but know they will not come to me\r\nnow; anyway, I'll tell what I can think of.\"\r\n\r\nHe tells of the use of iron pots, fireplaces with rods used to hold the\r\npots above the fire for cooking peas, rice, vegetables, meats, etc.; the\r\nhome-made coffee from meal, spring and well water, tanning rawhide for\r\nleather, spinning of thread from cotton and the weaving looms.\r\n\r\n\"There was no difference,\" he states, \"in the treatment of men and women\r\nfor work; my parents worked very hard and women did some jobs that we\r\nwould think them crazy for trying now; why my mother helped build a\r\nrailroad before she was married to my father. My mother's first husband\r\nwas sold away from her; shucks, some of the masters didn't care how they\r\ntreated husbands, wives, parents and children; any of them might be\r\nseparated from the other. A good price for a 'nigger' was $1500 on down\r\nand if one was what was called a stallion (healthy), able to get plenty\r\nchildren he would bring about $2500.\r\n\r\n\"They had what was called legal money--I did have some of it but guess\r\nit was burned when I lost my house by fire a few years ago.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my master had three boys and two girls; his wife, Elizabeth, was\r\nabout like the ordinary missus; Master Davis was good, but positive; he\r\ndidn't allow other whites to bother his slaves.\r\n\r\n\"When the war came, his two boys went first, finally Master Davis went;\r\nhe and one son never returned.\r\n\r\n\"The Yankees killed cows, etc., as they went along but did not destroy\r\nany property 'round where I was.\r\n\r\n\"We had preachers and doctors, but no schools; the white preachers told\r\nus to obey and would read the Bible (which we could not understand) and\r\ntold us not to steal eggs. Most of the doctors used herbs from the woods\r\nand \"Aunt Jane\" and \"Uncle Bob\" were known for using \"Samson's Snake\r\nRoot,\" \"Devil's shoe-string\" for stomach troubles and \"low-bud Myrtle\"\r\nfor fevers; that's good now, chile, if you can get it.\r\n\r\n\"The 'nigger' didn't have a chance to git in politics during slavery,\r\nbut after Emancipation, he went immediately into the Republican Party; a\r\nfew into the Democratic Party; there were many other parties, too.\r\n\r\n\"The religions were Methodist and Baptist; my master was Baptist and\r\nthat's what I am; we could attend church but dare not try to get any\r\neducation, less we punished with straps.\r\n\r\n\"There are many things I remember just like it was yesterday--the\r\ngeneral punishment was with straps--some of the slaves suffered terribly\r\non the plantations; if the master was poor and had few slaves he was\r\nmean--the more wealthy or more slaves he had, the better he was. In some\r\ncases it was the general law that made some of the masters as they were;\r\nas, the law required them to have an overseer or foreman (he was called\r\n\"boss man\") by the 'niggers' and usually came from the lower or poorer\r\nclasses of whites; he didn't like 'niggers' usually, and took authority\r\nto do as he pleased with them at times. Some plantations preferred and\r\ndid have 'nigger riders' that were next to the overseer or foreman, but\r\nthey were liked better than the foreman and in many instances were\r\ntreated like foremen but the law would not let them be called \"foremen.\"\r\nSome of the masters stood between the 'nigger riders' and foremen and\r\nsome cases, the 'nigger' was really boss.\r\n\r\n\"The punishments, as I said were cruel--some masters would hang the\r\nslaves up by both thumbs so that their toes just touched the floor,\r\nwomen and men, alike. Many slaves ran away; others were forced by their\r\ntreatment to do all kinds of mean things. Some slaves would dig deep\r\nholes along the route of the \"Patrollers\" and their horses would fall in\r\nsometimes breaking the leg of the horse, arm or leg of the rider; some\r\nslaves took advantage of the protection their masters would give them\r\nwith the overseer or other plantation owners, would do their devilment\r\nand \"fly\" to their masters who did not allow a man from another\r\nplantation to bother his slaves. I have known pregnant women to go ten\r\nmiles to help do some devilment. My mother was a very strong woman (as I\r\ntold you she helped build a railroad), and felt that she could whip any\r\nordinary man, would not get a passport unless she felt like it; once\r\nwhen caught on another plantation without a passport, she had all of us\r\nwith her, made all of the children run, but wouldn't run\r\nherself--somehow she went upstream, one of the men's horse's legs was\r\nbroken and she told him \"come and get me\" but she knew the master\r\nallowed no one to come on his place to punish his slaves.\r\n\r\n\"My father was a blacksmith and made the chains used for stocks, (like\r\nhandcuffs), used on legs and hands. The slaves were forced to lay flat\r\non their backs and were chained down to the board made for that purpose;\r\nthey were left there for hours, sometimes through rain and cold; he\r\nmight 'holler' and groan but that did not always get him released.\r\n\r\n\"The Race became badly mixed then; some Negro women were forced into\r\nassociation, some were beaten almost to death because they refused. The\r\nNegro men dare not bother or even speak to some of their women.\r\n\r\n\"In one instance an owner of a plantation threatened a Negro rider's\r\nsweetheart; she told him and he went crying to this owner who in turned\r\nthreatened him and probably did hit the woman; straight to his master\r\nthis sweetheart went and when he finished his story, his master\r\nimmediately took his team and drove to the other plantation--drove so\r\nfast that one of his horses' dropped dead; when the owner came out he\r\nlevelled his double-barrel shotgun at him and shot him dead. No, suh;\r\nsome masters did not allow you to bother their slaves.\r\n\r\n\"A peculiar case was that of Old Jim who lived on another plantation was\r\nleft to look out for the fires and do other chores around the house\r\nwhile 'marster' was at war. A bad rumor spread, and do you know those\r\nmean devils, overseers of nearby plantations came out and got her dug a\r\ndeep hole, and despite her cries, buried her up to her neck--nothing was\r\nleft out but her head and hair. A crowd of young 'nigger boys' saw it\r\nall and I was one among the crowd that helped dig her out.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there's a lots more I know but just cant get it together. My\r\nmother's name was Caroline and my father Patrick; all took the name of\r\nDavis from our master. There were thirteen children--I am the only one\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis appears well preserved for his age; he has most of his teeth\r\nand is slightly gray; his health seems to be good, although he is a\r\ncripple and uses a cane for walking always; this condition he believes\r\nis the result of an attack of rheumatism.\r\n\r\nHe is a preacher and has pastored in Alabama, Texas and Florida. He has\r\nhad several years of training in public schools and under ministers.\r\n\r\nHe has lived in Jacksonville since 1918 coming here from Waycross,\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nHe was married for the first and only time during his 62 years of life\r\nto Mrs. Lizzie P. Brown, November 19, 1935. There are no children. He\r\ngives no reason for remaining single, but his reason for marrying was\r\n\"to give some lady the privilege and see how it feels to be called\r\nhusband.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1. Interview with Young Winston Davis, 742 W. 10th Street, Jacksonville,\r\nFlorida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nJames Johnson, Field Worker\r\nSouth Jacksonville, Florida\r\nJanuary 11, 1937\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS DORSEY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn South Jacksonville, on the Spring Glen Road lives Douglas Dorsey, an\r\nex-slave, born in Suwannee County, Florida in 1851, fourteen years prior\r\nto freedom. His parents Charlie and Anna Dorsey were natives of Maryland\r\nand free people. In those days, Dorsey relates there were people known\r\nas \"Nigger Traders\" who used any subterfuge to catch Negroes and sell\r\nthem into slavery. There was one Jeff Davis who was known as a\r\nprofessional \"Nigger Trader,\" his slave boat docked in the slip at\r\nMaryland and Jeff Davis and his henchmen went out looking for their\r\nvictims. Unfortunately, his mother Anna and his father were caught one\r\nnight and were bound and gagged and taken to Jeff Davis' boat which was\r\nwaiting in the harbor, and there they were put into stocks. The boat\r\nstayed in port until it was loaded with Negroes, then sailed for Florida\r\nwhere Davis disposed of his human cargo.\r\n\r\nDouglas Dorsey's parents were sold to Colonel Louis Matair, who had a\r\nlarge plantation that was cultivated by 85 slaves. Colonel Matair's\r\nhouse was of the pretentious southern colonial type which was quite\r\nprevalent during that period. The colonel had won his title because of\r\nhis participation in the Indian War in Florida. He was the typical\r\nwealthy southern gentleman, and was very kind to his slaves. His wife,\r\nhowever was just the opposite. She was exceedingly mean and could easily\r\nbe termed a tyrant.\r\n\r\nThere were several children in the Matair family and their home and\r\nplantation were located in Suwannee County, Florida.\r\n\r\nDouglas' parents were assigned to their tasks, his mother was house-maid\r\nand his father was the mechanic, having learned this trade in Maryland\r\nas a free man. Charlie and Anna had several children and Douglas was\r\namong them. When he became large enough he was kept in the Matair home\r\nto build fires, assist in serving meals and other chores.\r\n\r\nMrs. Matair being a very cruel woman, would whip the slaves herself for\r\nany misdemeanor. Dorsey recalls an incident that is hard to obliterate\r\nfrom his mind, it is as follows: Dorsey's mother was called by Mrs.\r\nMatair, not hearing her, she continued with her duties, suddenly Mrs.\r\nMatair burst out in a frenzy of anger over the woman not answering. Anna\r\nexplained that she did not hear her call, thereupon Mrs. Matair seized a\r\nlarge butcher knife and struck at Anna, attempting to ward off the blow,\r\nAnna received a long gash on the arm that laid her up for for some\r\ntime. Young Douglas was a witness to this brutal treatment of his mother\r\nand he at that moment made up his mind to kill his mistress. He intended\r\nto put strychnine that was used to kill rats into her coffee that he\r\nusually served her. Fortunately freedom came and saved him of this act\r\nwhich would have resulted in his death.\r\n\r\nHe relates another incident in regard to his mistress as follows: To his\r\nmother and father was born a little baby boy, whose complexion was\r\nrather light. Mrs. Matair at once began accusing Colonel Matair as being\r\nthe father of the child. Naturally the colonel denied, but Mrs. Matair\r\nkept harassing him about it until he finally agreed to his wife's desire\r\nand sold the child. It was taken from its mother's breast at the age of\r\neight months and auctioned off on the first day of January to the\r\nhighest bidder. The child was bought by a Captain Ross and taken across\r\nthe Suwannee River into Hamilton County. Twenty years later he was\r\nlocated by his family, he was a grown man, married and farming.\r\n\r\nYoung Douglas had the task each morning of carrying the Matair\r\nchildren's books to school. Willie, a boy of eight would teach Douglas\r\nwhat he learned in school, finally Douglas learned the alphabet and\r\nnumbers. In some way Mrs. Matair learned that Douglas was learning to\r\nread and write. One morning after breakfast she called her son Willie to\r\nthe dining room where she was seated and then sent for Douglas to come\r\nthere too. She then took a quill pen the kind used at that time, and\r\nbegan writing the alphabet and numerals as far as ten. Holding the paper\r\nup to Douglas, she asked him if he knew what they were; he proudly\r\nanswered in the affirmative, not suspecting anything. She then asked him\r\nto name the letters and numerals, which he did, she then asked him to\r\nwrite them, which he did. When he reached the number ten, very proud of\r\nhis learning, she struck him a heavy blow across the face, saying to him\r\n\"If I ever catch you making another figure anywhere I'll cut off your\r\nright arm.\" Naturally Douglas and also her son Willie were much\r\nsurprised as each thought what had been done was quite an achievement.\r\nShe then called Mariah, the cook to bring a rope and tying the two of\r\nthem to the old colonial post on the front porch, she took a chair and\r\nsat between the two, whipping them on their naked backs for such a time,\r\nthat for two weeks their clothes stuck to their backs on the lacerated\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nTo ease the soreness, Willie would steal grease from the house and\r\ntogether they would slip into the barn and grease each other's backs.\r\n\r\nAs to plantation life, Dorsey said that the slaves lived in quarters\r\nespecially built for them on the plantation. They would leave for the\r\nfields at \"sun up\" and remain until \"sun-down,\" stopping only for a meal\r\nwhich they took along with them.\r\n\r\nInstead of having an overseer they had what was called a \"driver\" by\r\nthe name of Januray[TR:?]. His duties were to get the slaves together in\r\nthe morning and see that they went to the fields and assigned them to\r\ntheir tasks. He worked as the other slaves, though, he had more\r\npriveliges. He would stop work at any time he pleased and go around to\r\ninspect the work of the others, and thus rest himself. Most of the\r\norders from the master were issued to him. The crops consisted of\r\ncotton, corn, cane and peas, which was raised in abundance.\r\n\r\nWhen the slaves left the fields, they returned to their cabins and after\r\npreparing and eating of their evening meal they gathered around a cabin\r\nto sing and moan songs seasoned with African melody. Then to the tune of\r\nan old fiddle they danced a dance called the \"Green Corn Dance\" and \"Cut\r\nthe Pigeon wing.\" Sometimes the young men on the plantation would slip\r\naway to visit a girl on another plantation. If they were caught by the\r\n\"Patrols\" while on these visits they would be lashed on the bare backs\r\nas a penalty for this offense.\r\n\r\nA whipping post was used for this purpose. As soon as one slave was\r\nwhipped, he was given the whip to whip his brother slave. Very often the\r\nlashes would bring blood very soon from the already lacerated skin, but\r\nthis did not stop the lashing until one had received their due number of\r\nlashes.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the slaves were ordered to church to hear a white\r\nminister, they were seated in the front pews of the master's church,\r\nwhile the whites sat in the rear. The minister's admonition to them to\r\nhonor their masters and mistresses, and to have no other God but them,\r\nas \"we cannot see the other God, but you can see your master and\r\nmistress.\" After the services the driver's wife who could read and write\r\na little would tell them that what the minister said \"was all lies.\"\r\n\r\nDouglas says that he will never forget when he was a lad 14 years of\r\nage, when one evening he was told to go and tell the driver to have all\r\nthe slaves come up to the house; soon the entire host of about 85 slaves\r\nwere gathered there all sitting around on stumps, some standing. The\r\ncolonel's son was visibly moved as he told them they were free. Saying\r\nthey could go anywhere they wanted to for he had no more to do with\r\nthem, or that they could remain with him and have half of what was\r\nraised on the plantation.\r\n\r\nThe slaves were happy at this news, as they had hardly been aware that\r\nthere had been a war going on. None of them accepted the offer of the\r\ncolonel to remain, as they were only too glad to leaver the cruelties of\r\nthe Matair plantation.\r\n\r\nDorsey's father got a job with Judge Carraway of Suwannee where he\r\nworked for one year. He later homesteaded 40 acres of land that he\r\nreceived from the government and began farming. Dorsey's father died in\r\nSuwannee County, Florida when Douglas was a young man and then he and\r\nhis mother moved to Arlington, Florida. His mother died several years\r\nago at a ripe old age.\r\n\r\nDouglas Dorsey, aged but with a clear mind lives with his daughter in\r\nSpring Glen.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1. Interview with Douglas Dorsey, living on Spring Glen Road, South\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nMartin D. Richardson, Field Worker\r\nBrooksville, Florida\r\n\r\nAMBROSE DOUGLASS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1861, when he was 16 years old, Ambrose Hilliard Douglass was given a\r\nsound beating by his North Carolina master because he attempted to\r\nrefuse the mate that had been given to him--with the instructions to\r\nproduce a healthy boy-child by her--and a long argument on the value of\r\nhaving good, strong, healthy children. In 1937, at the age of 92,\r\nAmbrose Douglass welcomed his 38th child into the world.\r\n\r\nThe near-centenarian lives near Brooksville, in Hernando County, on a\r\nrun-down farm that he no longer attempts to tend now that most of his 38\r\nchildren have deserted the farm for the more lucrative employment of the\r\ncities of the phosphate camps.\r\n\r\nDouglass was born free in Detroit in 1845. His parents returned South to\r\nvisit relatives still in slavery, and were soon reenslaved themselves,\r\nwith their children. Ambrose was one of these.\r\n\r\nFor 21 years he remained in slavery; sometimes at the plantation of his\r\noriginal master in North Carolina, sometimes in other sections after he\r\nhad been sold to different masters.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, I been sold a lot of times\", the old man states. \"Our master\r\ndidn't believe in keeping a house, a horse or a darky after he had a\r\nchance to make some money on him. Mostly, though, I was sold when I cut\r\nup\".\r\n\r\n\"I was a young man\", he continues, \"and didn't see why I should be\r\nanybody's slave. I'd run away every chance I got. Sometimes they near\r\nkilled me, but mostly they just sold me. I guess I was pretty husky, at\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"They never did get their money's worth out of me, though. I worked as\r\nlong as they stood over me, then I ran around with the gals or sneaked\r\noff to the woods. Sometimes they used to put dogs on me to get me back.\r\n\r\n\"When they finally sold me to a man up in Suwannee County--his name was\r\nHarris--I thought it would be the end of the world. We had heard about\r\nhim all the way up in Virginia. They said he beat you, starved you and\r\ntied you up when you didn't work, and killed you if you ran away.\r\n\r\n\"But I never had a better master. He never beat me, and always fed all\r\nof us. 'Course, we didn't get too much to eat; corn meal, a little piece\r\nof fat meat now and then, cabbages, greens, potatoes, and plenty of\r\nmolasses. When I worked up at 'the house' I et just what the master et;\r\nsometimes he would give it to me his-self. When he didn't, I et it\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\n\"He was so good, and I was so scared of him, till I didn't ever run away\r\nfrom his place\", Ambrose reminisces; \"I had somebody there that I liked,\r\nanyway. When he finally went to the war, he sold me back to a man in\r\nNorth Carolina, in Hornett County. But the war was near over then; I\r\nsoon was as free as I am now.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we musta celebrated 'Mancipation about twelve times in Hornett\r\nCounty. Every time a bunch of No'thern sojers would come through they\r\nwould tell us we was free and we'd begin celebratin'. Before we would\r\nget through somebody else would tell us to go back to work, and we would\r\ngo. Some of us wanted to jine up with the army, but didn't know who was\r\ngoin' to win and didn't take no chances.\r\n\r\n\"I was 21 when freedom finally came, and that time I didn't take no\r\nchances on 'em taking it back again. I lit out for Florida and wound up\r\nin Madison County. I had a nice time there; I got married, got a plenty\r\nof work, and made me a little money. I fixed houses, built 'em, worked\r\naround the yards, and did everything. My first child was already born; I\r\ndidn't know there was goin' to be 37 more, though. I guess I would have\r\nstopped right there....\r\n\r\n\"I stayed in Madison County until they started to working concrete rock\r\ndown here. I heard about it and thought that would be a good way for me\r\nto feed all them two dozen children I had. So I came down this side.\r\nThat was about 20 years ago.\r\n\r\n\"I got married again after I got here; right soon after. My wife now is\r\n30 years old; we already had 13 children together. (His wife is a\r\nslight, girlish-looking woman; she says she was 13 when she married\r\nDouglass, had her first child that year. Eleven of her thirteen are\r\nstill living.)\r\n\r\n\"Yossuh, I ain't long stopped work. I worked here in the phosphate mine\r\nuntil last year, when they started to paying pensions. I thought I\r\nwould get one, but all I got was some PWA work, and this year they told\r\nme I was too old for that. I told 'em I wasn't but 91, but they didn't\r\ngive nothin' else. I guess I'll get my pension soon, though. My oldest\r\nboy ought to get it, too; he's sixty-five.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLK STUFF, FLORIDA\r\n\r\nJules A.

Worry makes folks\r\ngray-headed.\" She scratched her head where three gray braids, about the\r\nlength and thickness of a flapper's eyebrow, stuck out at odd angles.\r\n\r\n\"I sho got plenty chancet to worry ifen I wants to,\" she mused, as she\r\nsipped water from a fruit-jar foul with fingermarks. \"Relief folks got\r\nme on dey black list. Dey won't give me rations--dey give rations to\r\nyoung folks whas workin, but won't give me nary a mouthful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dey wanted me to go to de poor house.

Got my old blue-back\r\nWebster, onliest book I ever had, scusin my Bible. Think I wanna throw\r\ndat stuff away? No-o, suh!\" Mama Duck pushed the dog away from a\r\ncracked pitcher on the floor and refilled her fruit-jar. \"So day black\r\nlist me, cause I won't kiss dey feets. I ain kissin _nobody's_\r\nfeets--wouldn't kiss my own mammy's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'd all do lots of things for our mothers that we wouldn't do\r\nfor anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you would, but not me. My mammy put me in a hickry basket when I\r\nwas a day an a half old, with nothin on but my belly band an diaper.\r\nTook me down in de cotton patch an sot me on a stump in de bilin sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in the world did she do that for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cause I was black.

'Any woman\r\nwhat'd leave a poor lil mite like dis to perish to death ain fitten to\r\nbe no datter o' mine.'\r\n\r\n\"So granmammy took me to raise. I ain never seen my mammy sincet, an I\r\nain never wanted to.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did your father think of the way she treated you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never knew who my daddy was, an I reckon she didn't either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember anything about the Civil War?\"\r\n\r\n\"What dat?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Civil War, when they set the slaves free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you mean de fust war. I reckon I does--had three chillern, boys,\r\nborned fore de war. When I was old enough to work I was taken to Pelman,\r\nJawja. Dey let me nust de chillern. Den I got married.

Dis ol' house aint fitten fer nobody t' live in;\r\nwinder glass gone an' roof leaks. Young folks in dese parts done be'n\r\nusin' it fer a co't house 'fore I come; you know--a place to do dey\r\ncourtin' in. Kep' a-comin' atter I done move in, an' I had to shoo 'em\r\naway.\r\n\r\nDat young rascal comin' yondah, he one of 'em. I claiah to goodness, I\r\nwisht I had a fence to keep folks outa my yahd. Reckon you don't know\r\nwhat he be quackin' lak dat fer. Dat's 'cause my name's \"Mama Duck.\" He\r\ndoin' it jus' t' pester me. But dat don't worry me none; I done quit\r\nworryin'.\r\n\r\nI sho' had plenty chance to worry, though. Relief folks got me on dey\r\nblack list. Dey give rashuns to young folks what's wukkin' an' don't\r\ngive me nary a mouthful. Reason fer dat be 'cause dey wanted me t' go t'\r\nde porehouse. I wanted t' take my trunk 'long, an' dey wouldn't lemme. I\r\ngot some things in dere I be'n havin' nigh onto a hunnert years. Got my\r\nol' blue-back Webster, onliest book I evah had, 'scusin' mah Bible.\r\nThink I wanna th'ow dat away? No-o suh!\r\n\r\nSo dey black-list me, 'cause I won't kiss dey feets. I ain't kissin\r\n_nobody's_, wouldn't kiss my own mammy's.\r\n\r\nI nevah see my mammy. She put me in a hick'ry basket when I on'y a day\r\nand a half old, with nuthin' on but mah belly band an' di'per. Took me\r\ndown in de cotton patch an' sot de basket on a stump in de bilin sun.\r\nDidn't want me, 'cause I be black.

Nevah knowed who my daddy was, an' I reckon my mammy didn't know,\r\nneithah. I bawn at Richard, Vahjinny. My sistah an' brothah be'n dead\r\ntoo many years to count; I de las' o' de fam'ly.\r\n\r\nI kin remember 'fore de fust war start. I had three chillen, boys,\r\ntaller'n me when freedom come. Mah fust mastah didn't make de li'l\r\nchillen wuk none. All I done was play. W'en I be ol' enough t' wuk, dey\r\ntuk us to Pelman, Jawjah. I never wukked in de fiel's none, not den. Dey\r\nallus le me nuss de chillens.\r\n\r\nDen I got married. Hit wa'nt no church weddin'; we got married in\r\ngran'mammy's kitchen, den we go to our own log house. By an' by mah\r\nmahster sol' me an' mah baby to de man what had de plantation nex' to\r\nours. His name was John Lee. He was good to me, an' let me see my\r\nchillens.\r\n\r\nI nevah got no beatin's. Onliest thing I evah got was a li'l slap on de\r\nhan', lak dat. Didn't hurt none. But I'se seen cullud men on de Bradley\r\nplantation git tur'ble beatin's. De whippin' boss was Joe Sylvester, a\r\nwhite man. He had pets mongst de wimmen folks, an' used t' let 'em off\r\neasy, w'en dey desarved a good beatin'. Sometimes 'e jes' bop 'em crost\r\nde ear wid a battlin' stick, or kick 'em in de beehind.\r\n\r\nYou don't know what's a battlin' stick? Well, dis here be one. You use\r\nit fer washin' close. You lif's de close outa de wash pot wid dis here\r\nbattlin' stick; den you tote 'em to de battlin' block--dis here stump.\r\nDen you beat de dirt out wid de battlin' stick.\r\n\r\nDe whippin' boss got pets 'mongst de mens, too, but dey got it a li'l\r\nwusser'n de wimmens. Effen dey wan't _too_ mean, he jes' strap 'em\r\n'crost de sharp side of a bar'l an' give 'em a few right smaht licks wid\r\na bull whip.\r\n\r\nBut dey be some niggahs he whip good an' hard. If dey sass back, er try\r\nt' run away, he mek 'em cross dey han's lak dis; den he pull 'em up, so\r\ndey toes jes' tetch de ground'; den he smack 'em crost de back an' rump\r\nwid a big wood paddle, fixed full o' holes. Know what dem holes be for?\r\nEv'y hole mek a blister. Den he mek 'em lay down on de groun', whilst he\r\nbus' all dem blisters wid a rawhide whip.\r\n\r\nI nevah heard o' nobody dyin' f'm gittin' a beatin'. Some couldn't wuk\r\nfer a day or so. Sometimes de whippin' boss th'ow salt brine on dey\r\nbacks, or smear on turpentine, to mek it well quicker.\r\n\r\nI don't know, 'zackly, how old I is. Mebbe--wait a minute, I didn't show\r\nyou my pitcher what was in de paper. I cain't read, but somebody say dey\r\nput down how old I is undah mah pitcher.

Some of 'em lived in tents, till dey c'd cut logs an' build\r\nhouses wid stick-an'-dirt chimbleys.\r\n\r\nLotta folks ask me how I come to be called \"Mama Duck.\" Dat be jes' a\r\ndevil-ment o' mine. I named my own se'f dat. One day when I be 'bout\r\ntwelve year old, I come home an' say, \"Well, gran'mammy, here come yo'\r\nli'l ducky home again.\" She hug me an' say, \"Bress mah li'l ducky.\" Den\r\nshe keep on callin' me dat, an' when I growed up, folks jes' put de\r\n\"Mama\" on.\r\n\r\nI reckon I a heap bettah off dem days as I is now. Allus had sumpin t'\r\neat an' a place t' stay. No sech thing ez gittin' on a black list dem\r\ndays.

His parents were Amos and Mariah Dukes, both\r\nborn on this plantation, he thinks. As they were a healthy pair they\r\nwere required to work long hours in the fields, although the master was\r\nnot actually cruel to them.\r\n\r\nOn this plantation a variety of products was grown, cotton, corn,\r\npotatoes, peas, rice and sugar cane. Nothing was thrown away and the\r\nslaves had only coarse foods such as corn bread, collard greens, peas\r\nand occasionally a little rice or white bread. Even the potatoes were\r\nreserved for the white folk and \"house niggers.\"\r\n\r\nAs a child Willis was required to \"tote water and wood, help at milking\r\ntime and run errands.\" His clothing consisted of only a homespun shirt\r\nthat was made on the plantation. Nearly everything used was grown or\r\nmanufactured on the plantation. Candles were made in the big house by\r\nthe cook and a batch of slaves from the quarters, all of them being\r\nrequired to bring fat and tallow that had been saved for this purpose.\r\nThese candles were for the use of the master and mistress, as the slaves\r\nused fat lightwood torches for lighting purposes. Cotton was used for\r\nmaking clothes, and it was spun and woven into cloth by the slave women,\r\nthen stored in the commisary for future use. Broggan shoes were made of\r\ntanned leather held together by tacks made of maple wood. Lye soap was\r\nmade in large pots, cut into chunks and issued from the smoke house.\r\nPotash was secured from the ashes of burnt oak wood and allowed to set\r\nin a quantity of grease that had also been saved for the purpose, then\r\nboiled into soap.\r\n\r\nThe cotton was gathered in bags of bear grass and deposited in baskets\r\nwoven with strips of white oak that had been dried in the sun.\r\n\r\nWillis remembers the time when a slave on the plantation escaped and\r\nwent north to live. This man managed to communicate with his family\r\nsomehow, and it was whispered about that he was \"living very high\" and\r\nactually saving money with which to buy his family. He was even going to\r\nschool. This fired all the slaves with an ambition to go north and this\r\nmade them more than usually interested in the outcome of the war between\r\nthe states. He was too young to fully understand the meaning of freedom\r\nbut wanted very much to go away to some place where he could earn\r\nenough money to buy his mother a real silk dress. He confided this\r\ninformation to her and she was very proud of him but gave him a good\r\nspanking for fear he expressed this desire for freedom to his young\r\nmaster or mistress.\r\n\r\nPrayer meetings were very frequent during the days of the war and very\r\noften the slaves were called in from the fields and excused from their\r\nlabors so they could hold these prayer meetings, always praying God for\r\nthe safe return of their master.\r\n\r\nThe master did not return after the war and when the soldiers in blue\r\ncame through that section the frightened women were greatly dependent\r\nupon their slaves for protection and livelihood. Many of these black man\r\nchose loyalty to their dead masters to freedom and shouldered the burden\r\nof the support of their former mistresses cheerfully.\r\n\r\nAfter the war Willis' father was one of those to remain with his widowed\r\nmistress. Other members of his family left as soon as they were freed,\r\neven his wife. They thus remained separated until her death.\r\n\r\nWillis saw his first bedspring about 50 years ago and he still thinks a\r\nfeather mattress superior to the store-bought variety. He recalls a\r\nhumorous incident which occurred when he was a child and had been\r\nintroduced for the first time to the task of picking a goose.\r\n\r\nAfter demonstrating how it was done to a group of slave children, the\r\nperson in charge had gone about his way leaving them busily engaged in\r\npicking the goose. They had been told that the one gathering the most\r\nfeathers would receive a piece of money. Sometimes later the overseer\r\nreturned to find a dozen geese that had been stripped of all the\r\nfeathers. They had been told to pick only the pin feathers beneath the\r\nwings and about the bodies of the geese. Need we guess what happened to\r\nthe over ambitious children?\r\n\r\nHe had heard of ice long before he looked upon it and he only thought of\r\nit as another wild experiment. Why buy ice, when watermelons and butter\r\ncould be ley down into the well to keep cool?\r\n\r\nOne of Willis' happiest moments was when he earned enough money to buy\r\nhis first pair of patern leather shoes. To possess a paid of store\r\nbought shoes had been his ambition since he was a child, when he had to\r\nshine the shoes of his master and those of the master's children.\r\n\r\nHe next owned a horse and buggy of which he was very proud. This\r\nincreased his popularity with the girls and bye and bye he was married\r\nto Mary, a girl with whom he had been reared. Nobody was surprised but\r\nMary, explained Mr. Dukes. \"Me and everybody else knowed us ud get\r\nmarried some day. We didn't jump over no broom neither. We was married\r\nlike white folks wid flowers and cake and everything.\"\r\n\r\nWillis Dukes has been in Florida for \"Lawd knows how long\" and prefers\r\nthis state to his home state. He still has a few relatives there but has\r\nnever returned since leaving so long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1. Personal Interview with Willis Dukes, Valdosta Road, near Jeslamb\r\nChurch, Madison, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nPearl Randolph, Field Worker\r\nJohn A. Simms, Editor\r\nMulberry, Florida\r\nOctober 8, 1936\r\n\r\nSAM AND LOUISA EVERETT\r\n\r\n\r\nSam and Louise Everett, 86 and 90 years of age respectively, have\r\nweathered together some of the worst experiences of slavery, and as they\r\nlook back over the years, can relate these experiences as clearly as if\r\nthey had happened only yesterday.\r\n\r\nBoth were born near Norfolk, Virginia and sold as slaves several times\r\non nearby plantations. It was on the plantation of \"Big Jim\" McClain\r\nthat they met as slave-children and departed after Emancipation to live\r\nthe lives of free people.\r\n\r\nSam was the son of Peter and Betsy Everett, field hands who spent long\r\nback-breaking hours in the cotton fields and came home at nightfall to\r\ncultivate their small garden. They lived in constant fear that their\r\nmaster would confiscate most of their vegetables; he so often did.\r\n\r\nLouisa remembers little about her parents and thinks that she was sold\r\nat an early age to a separate master. Her name as nearly as she could\r\nremember was Norfolk Virginia. Everyone called her \"Nor.\" It was not\r\nuntil after she was freed and had sent her children to school that she\r\nchanged her name to Louisa.\r\n\r\nSam and Norfolk spent part of their childhood on the plantation of \"Big\r\nJim\" who was very cruel; often he would whip his slaves into\r\ninsensibility for minor offences. He sometimes hung them up by their\r\nthumbs whenever they were caught attempting to escape--\"er fer no reason\r\natall.\"\r\n\r\nOn this plantation were more than 100 slaves who were mated\r\nindiscriminately and without any regard for family unions. If their\r\nmaster thought that a certain man and woman might have strong, healthy\r\noffspring, he forced them to have sexual relation, even though they were\r\nmarried to other slaves. If there seemed to be any slight reluctance on\r\nthe part of either of the unfortunate ones \"Big Jim\" would make them\r\nconsummate this relationship in his presence. He used the same procedure\r\nif he thought a certain couple was not producing children fast enough.\r\nHe enjoyed these orgies very much and often entertained his friends in\r\nthis manner; quite often he and his guests would engage in these\r\ndebaucheries, choosing for themselves the prettiest of the young women.\r\nSometimes they forced the unhappy husbands and lovers of their victims\r\nto look on.\r\n\r\nLouisa and Sam were married in a very revolting manner. To quote the\r\nwoman:\r\n\r\n\"Marse Jim called me and Sam ter him and ordered Sam to pull off his\r\nshirt--that was all the McClain niggers wore--and he said to me: 'Nor,\r\ndo you think you can stand this big nigger?' He had that old bull whip\r\nflung acrost his shoulder, and Lawd, that man could hit so hard! So I\r\njes said 'yassur, I guess so,' and tried to hide my face so I couldn't\r\nsee Sam's nakedness, but he made me look at him anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he told us what we must git busy and do in his presence, and we\r\nhad to do it. After that we were considered man and wife. Me and Sam was\r\na healthy pair and had fine, big babies, so I never had another man\r\nforced on me, thank God. Sam was kind to me and I learnt to love him.\"\r\n\r\nLife on the McClain plantation was a steady grind of work from morning\r\nuntil night. Slaves had to rise in the dark of the morning at the\r\nringing of the \"Big House\" bell. After eating a hasty breakfast of fried\r\nfat pork and corn pone, they worked in the fields until the bell rang\r\nagain at noon; at which time they ate boiled vegetables, roasted sweet\r\npotatoes and black molasses. This food was cooked in iron pots which had\r\nlegs attached to their bottoms in order to keep them from resting\r\ndirectly on the fire. These utensils were either hung over a fire or set\r\natop a mound of hot coals. Biscuits were a luxury but whenever they had\r\nwhite bread it was cooked in another thick pan called a \"spider\". This\r\npan had a top which was covered with hot embers to insure the browning\r\nof the bread on top.\r\n\r\nSlave women had no time for their children. These were cared for by an\r\nold woman who called them twice a day and fed them \"pot likker\"\r\n(vegetable broth) and skimmed milk. Each child was provided with a\r\nwooden laddle which he dipped into a wooden trough and fed himself. The\r\nolder children fed those who were too young to hold a laddle.\r\n\r\nSo exacting was \"Big Jim\" that slaves were forced to work even when\r\nsick. Expectant mothers toiled in the fields until they felt their labor\r\npains. It was not uncommon for babies to be born in the fields.\r\n\r\nThere was little time for play on his plantation. Even the very small\r\nchildren were assigned tasks. They hunted hen's eggs, gathered poke\r\nberries for dyeing, shelled corn and drove the cows home in the evening.\r\nLittle girls knitted stockings.\r\n\r\nThere was no church on this plantation and itinerant ministers avoided\r\ngoing there because of the owner's cruelty. Very seldom were the slaves\r\nallowed to attend neighboring churches and still rarer were the\r\nopportunities to hold meetings among themselves. Often when they were in\r\nthe middle of a song or prayer they would be forced to halt and run to\r\nthe \"Big House.\" Woe to any slave who ignored the ringing of the bell\r\nthat summoned him to work and told him when he might \"knock off\" from\r\nhis labors.\r\n\r\nLouisa and Sam last heard the ringing of this bell in the fall of 1865.\r\nAll the slaves gathered in front of the \"Big House\" to be told that they\r\nwere free for the time being. They had heard whisperings of the War but\r\ndid not understand the meaning of it all. Now \"Big Jim\" stood weeping on\r\nthe piazza and cursing the fate that had been so cruel to him by robbing\r\nhim of all his \"niggers.\" He inquired if any wanted to remain until all\r\nthe crops were harvested and when no one consented to do so, he flew\r\ninto a rage; seizing his pistol, he began firing into the crowd of\r\nfrightened Negroes. Some were _killed_ outright and others were maimed\r\nfor life. Finally he was prevailed upon to stop. He then attempted to\r\ntake his own life. A few frightened slaves promised to remain with him\r\nanother year; this placated him. It was necessary for Union soldiers to\r\nmake another visit to the plantation before \"Big Jim\" would allow his\r\nformer slaves to depart.\r\n\r\nSam and Louisa moved to Boston, Georgia, where they sharecropped for\r\nseveral years; they later bought a small farm when their two sons became\r\nold enough to help. They continued to live on this homestead until a few\r\nyears ago, when their advancing ages made it necessary that they live\r\nwith the children. Both of the children had settled in Florida several\r\nyears previous and wanted their parents to come to them. They now live\r\nin Mulberry, Florida with the younger son. Both are pitifully infirm but\r\ncan still remember the horrors they experienced under very cruel owners.\r\nIt was with difficulty that they were prevailed upon to relate some of\r\nthe gruesome details recorded here.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1. Personal interview with Sam and Louisa Everett, P.O. Box 535 c/o\r\nE.P.J. Everett, Mulberry, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nPearl Randolph, Field Worker\r\nMadison, Florida\r\nNovember 24, 1936\r\n\r\nDUNCAN GAINES\r\n\r\n\r\nDuncan Gaines, the son of George and Martha Gaines was born on a\r\nplantation in Virginia on March 12, 1853. He was one of four children,\r\nall fortunate enough to remain with their parents until maturity. They\r\nwere sold many times, but Duncan Gaines best remembers the master who\r\nwas known as \"old man Beever.\"\r\n\r\nOn this plantation were about 50 slaves, who toiled all day in the\r\ncotton and tobacco fields and came home at dusk to cook their meals of\r\ncorn pone, collards and sweet potatoes on the hearths of their one room\r\ncabins. Biscuits were baked on special occasions by placing hot coals\r\natop the iron tops of long legged frying pans called spiders, and the\r\npotatoes were roasted in the ashes, likewise the corn pone. Their\r\nmasters being more or less kind, there was pork, chicken, syrup and\r\nother foodstuffs that they were allowed to raise as their own on a small\r\nscale. This work was often done by the light of a torch at night as they\r\nhad little time of their own. In this way slaves earned money for small\r\nluxuries and the more ambitious sometimes saved enough money to buy\r\ntheir freedom, although this was not encouraged very much.\r\n\r\nThe early life of Duncan was carefree and happy. With the exception of\r\ncarrying water to the laborers and running errands, he had little to do.\r\nMost of the time of the slave children was spent in playing ball and\r\nwrestling and foraging the woods for berries and fruits and playing\r\ngames as other children. They were often joined in their play by the\r\nmaster's children, who taught them to read and write and fired Duncan\r\nwith the ambition to be free, so that he could \"wear a frill on his\r\ncolar and own a pair of shoes that did not have brass caps on the toes\"\r\nand require the application of fat to make them shine.\r\n\r\nWearing his shoes shined as explained above and a coarse homespun suit\r\ndyed with oak bark, indigo or poke berries, he went to church on Sunday\r\nafternoons after the whites had had their services and listened to\r\nsermons delivered by white ministers who taught obedience to their\r\nmasters. After the services, most of the slaves would remove their shoes\r\nand carry them in their hands, as they were unaccustomed to wearing\r\nshoes except in winter.\r\n\r\nThe women were given Saturday afternoons off to launder their clothes\r\nand prepare for Sunday's services. All slaves were required to appear on\r\nMonday mornings as clean as possible with their clothing mended and\r\nheads combed.\r\n\r\nLye soap was used both for laundering and bathing. It was made from\r\nfragments of fat meat and skins that were carefully saved for that\r\npurpose. Potash was secured from oak ashes. This mixture was allowed to\r\nset for a certain period of time, then cooked to a jelly-like\r\nconsistency. After cooling, the soap was cut into square bars and\r\n\"lowanced out\" (allowance) to the slaves according to the number in each\r\nfamily. Once Duncan was given a bar of \"sweet\" soap by his mistress for\r\ndoing a particularly nice piece of work of polishing the harness of her\r\nfavorite mare and so proud was he of the gift that he put it among his\r\nSunday clothes to make them smell sweet. It was the first piece of\r\ntoilet sopa that he had ever seen; and it caused quite a bit of envy\r\namong the other slave children.\r\n\r\nDuncan Gaines does not remember his grandparents but thinks they were\r\nboth living on some nearby plantation. His father was the plantation\r\nblacksmith and Duncan liked to look on as plowshares, single trees,\r\nhorse shoes, etc were turned out or sharpened. His mother was strong and\r\nhealthy, so she toiled all day in the fields. Duncan always listened for\r\nhis mother's return from the field, which was heraled by a song, no\r\nmatter how tired she was. She was very fond of her children and did not\r\nshare the attitude of many slave mother who thought of their children as\r\nbelonging solely to the masters. She lived in constant fear that \"old\r\nmarse Seever\" would meet with some adversity and be forced to sell them\r\nseparately. She always whispered to them about \"de war\" and fanned to a\r\nflame their desire to be free.\r\n\r\nAt that time Negro children listened to the tales of _Raw Head and\r\nBloody Bones_, various animal stories and such childish ditties as:\r\n\r\n  \"Little Boy, Little Boy who made your breeches?\r\n  Mamma cut 'em out and pappa sewed de stitches.\"\r\n\r\nChildren were told that babies were dug out of tree stumps and were\r\ngenerally made to \"shut up\" if they questioned their elders about such\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nChildren with long or large heads were thought to be marked to become\r\n\"wise men.\" Everyone believed in ghosts and entertained all the\r\nsuperstitions that have been handed down to the present generation.\r\nThere was much talk of \"hoodooism\" and anyone ill for a long time\r\nwithout getting relief from herb medicines was thought to be \"fixed\" or\r\nsuffering from some sin that his father had committed.\r\n\r\nDuncan was 12 years of age when freedom was declared and remembers the\r\nhectic times which followed. He and other slave children attended\r\nschools provided by the Freedmen' Aid and other social organizations\r\nfostered by Northerners. Most of the instructors were whites sent to the\r\nSouth for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Gaines were industrious and soon owned a prosperous farm. They\r\nseldom had any money but had plenty of foodstuffs and clothing and a\r\nfairly comfortable home. All of the children secured enough learning to\r\nenable them to read and write, which was regarded as very unusual in\r\nthose days. Slaves had been taught that their brain was inferior to the\r\nwhites who owned them and for this reason, many parents refused to send\r\ntheir children to school, thinking it a waste of time and that too much\r\nlearning might cause some injury to the brain of their supposedly\r\nweak-minded children.\r\n\r\nOf the various changes, Duncan remembers very little, so gradual did\r\nthey occur in his section. Water was secured from the spring or well.\r\nPerishable foodstuffs were let down into the well to keep cool. Shoes\r\nwere made from leather tanned by setting in a solution of red oak bark\r\nand water; laundering was done in wooden tubs, made from barrels cut in\r\nhalves. Candles were used for lighting and were made from sheep and beef\r\ntallow. Lightwood torches were used by those not able to afford candles.\r\nStockings were knitted by the women during cold or rainy weather.\r\nWeaving and spinning done by special slave women who were too old to\r\nwork in the fields; others made the cloth into garments. Everything was\r\ndone by hand except the luxuries imported by the wealthy.\r\n\r\nDuncan Gaines is now a widower and fast becoming infirm. He looks upon\r\nthis \"new fangled\" age with bare tolerance and feels that the happiest\r\nage of mankind has passed with the discarding of the simple, old\r\nfashioned way of doing things.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1. Personal interview with Duncan Gaines, Second Street near Madison\r\nTraining School for Negroes, Madison, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nRachel Austin, Secretary\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nApril 16, 1937\r\n\r\nCLAYBORN GANTLING\r\n\r\n\r\nClayborn Gantling was born in Dawson, Georgia, Terrell County, January\r\n20, 1848 on the plantation of Judge Williams.\r\n\r\nJudge Williams owned 102 heads of slaves and was known to be \"tolable\r\nnice to 'em in some way and pretty rough on 'em in other ways\" says Mr.\r\nGantling. \"He would'nt gi' us no coffee, 'cept on Sunday Mornings when\r\nwe would have shorts or seconds of wheat, which is de leavins' of flour\r\nat mills, yu' know, but we had plenty bacon, corn bread, taters and\r\npeas.\r\n\r\n\"As a child I uster have to tote water to de old people on de farm and\r\ntend de cows an' feed de sheep. Now, I can' say right 'zackly how things\r\nwuz during slavery 'cause its been a long time ago but we had cotton and\r\ncorn fields and de hands plowed hard, picked cotton grabbled penders,\r\ngathered peas and done all the other hard work to be done on de\r\nplantations. I wuz not big 'nuff to do all of dem things but I seed\r\nplenty of it done.\r\n\r\n\"Dey made lye soap on de farms and used indigo from wood for dye. We\r\nniggers slept on hay piled on top of planks but de white folks had\r\nbetter beds.\r\n\r\n\"I don't 'member my grandparents but my mas was called Harriet Williams\r\nand my pa was called Henry Williams; dey wuz called Williams after my\r\nmaster. My mas and pa worked very hard and got some beatings but I don't\r\nknow what for. Dey wuz all kinds of money, five and ten dollar bills,\r\nand so on then, but I didn't ever see them with any.\r\n\r\n\"When war came along and Sherman came through the old people wuz very\r\nskeered on account of the white owners but there was no fighting close\r\nto me. My master's sons Leo and Fletcher joined the army and lots of de\r\nother masters went; de servants wuz sent along to wait on de young white\r\nmen. Guess you'd like to know if any were killed. 'I should smile,' two\r\nI know were killed.\r\n\r\n\"During those days for medicine, the old people used such things as\r\nbutterfly root and butterfly tea, sage tea, red oak bark,\r\nhippecat--something that grow--was used for fevers and bathing children.\r\nThey wuz white doctors and plenty of colored grannies.\r\n\r\n\"When de Yankees came they acted diffunt and was naturally better to\r\nservants than our masters had been; we colored folks done the best we\r\ncould but that was not so good right after freedom. Still it growed on\r\nand growed on getting better.\r\n\r\n\"Before freedom we always went to white churches on Sundays with passes\r\nbut they never mentioned God; they always told us to be \"good niggers\r\nand mind our missus and masters\".\r\n\r\n\"Judge Williams had ten or twelve heads of children but I can' 'member\r\nthe names of 'em now; his wife was called Mis' 'Manda and she was jes'\r\n'bout lak Marse Williams. I had 'bout eighteen head of boys and five\r\ngirls myself; dere was so many, I can' 'member all of dem.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gantling was asked to relate some incidents that he could remember\r\nof the lives of slaves, and he continued:\r\n\r\n\"Well the horn would blow every morning for you to git up and go right\r\nto work; when the sun ris' if you were not in the field working, you\r\nwould be whipped with whips and leather strops. I 'member Aunt Beaty was\r\nbeat until she could hardly get along but I can' 'member what for but do\r\nyou know she had to work along till she got better. My ma had to work\r\npretty hard but my oldest sister, Judy, was too young to work much.\r\n\r\n\"A heap of de slaves would run away and hide in de woods to keep from\r\nworking so hard but the white folks to keep them from running away so\r\nthat they could not ketch 'em would put a chain around the neck which\r\nwould hang down the back and be fastened on to another 'round the waist\r\nand another 'round the feet so they could not run, still they had to\r\nwork and sleep in 'em, too; sometimes they would wear these chains for\r\nthree or four months.\r\n\r\n\"When a slave would die they had wooden boxes to put 'em in and dug\r\nholes and just put then in. A slave might go to a sister or brother's\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\n\"My recollection is very bad and so much is forgotten, but I have seen\r\nslaves sold in droves like cows; they called 'em 'ruffigees,' and white\r\nmen wuz drivin' 'em like hogs and cows for sale. Mothers and fathers\r\nwere sold and parted from their chillun; they wuz sold to white people\r\nin diffunt states. I tell you chile, it was pitiful, but God did not let\r\nit last always. I have heard slaves morning and night pray for\r\ndeliverance. Some of 'em would stand up in de fields or bend over cotton\r\nand corn and pray out loud for God to help 'em and in time you see, He\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\"They had whut you call \"pattyrollers\" who would catch you from home and\r\n'wear you out' and send you back to your master. If a master had slaves\r\nhe jes' could not rule (some of 'em wuz hard and jes' would not mind de\r\nboss), he would ask him if he wanted to go to another plantation and if\r\nhe said he did, then, he would give him a pass and that pass would read:\r\n\"Give this nigger hell.\" Of course whan the \"pattyrollers\" or other\r\nplantation boss would read the pass he would beat him nearly to death\r\nand send him back. Of course the nigger could not read and did not know\r\nwhat the pass said. You see, day did not 'low no nigger to have a book\r\nor piece of paper of any kind and you know dey wuz not go teach any of\r\n'em to read.\r\n\r\n\"De women had it hard too; women with little babies would have to go to\r\nwork in de mornings with the rest, come back, nurse their chillun and go\r\nback to the field, stay two or three hours then go back and eat dinner;\r\nafter dinner dey would have to go to de field and stay two or three more\r\nhours then go and nurse the chillun again, go back to the field and stay\r\ntill night. One or maybe two old women would stay in a big house and\r\nkeep all de chillun while their mothers worked in de fields.\r\n\r\n\"Now dey is a heap more I could tell maybe but I don't think of no more\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gantling came to Florida to Jennings Plantation near Lake Park and\r\nstayed two years, then went to Everett's Plantation and stayed one year.\r\nFrom there he went to a place called High Hill and stayed two or three\r\nyears. He left there and went to Jasper, farmed and stayed until he\r\nmoved his family to Jacksonville. Here he worked on public works until\r\nhe started raising hogs and chickens which he continued up to about\r\nfourteen years ago. Now, he is too old to do anything but just \"sit\r\naround and talk and eat.\"\r\n\r\nHe lives with his daughter, Mrs. Minnie Holly and her husband, Mr. Dany\r\nHolly on Lee Street.\r\n\r\nMr. Gantling cannot read or write, but is very interesting.\r\n\r\nHe has been a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church for more\r\nthan fifty years.\r\n\r\nHe has a very good appetite and although has lost his teeth, he has\r\nnever worn a plate or had any dental work done. He is never sick and has\r\nhad but little medical attention during his lifetime. His form is bent\r\nand he walks with a cane; although his going is confined to his home, it\r\nis from choice as he seldom wears shoes on account of bad feet. His\r\neyesight is very good and his hobby is sewing. He threads his own\r\nneedles without assistance of glasses as he has never worn them.\r\n\r\nMr. Gantling celebrated his 89th birthday on the 20th day of November\r\n1936.\r\n\r\nHe is very small, also very short; quite active for his age and of a\r\nvery genial disposition, always smiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1. Interview with Mr. Clayborn Gantling, 1950 Lee Street, Jacksonville,\r\nFlorida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nMartin Richardson, Field Worker\r\nEatonville, Florida\r\n\r\nARNOLD GRAGSTON\r\n\r\n\r\n(Verbatim Interview with Arnold Gragston, 97-year-old ex-slave whose\r\nearly life was spent helping slaves to freedom across the Ohio River,\r\nwhile he, himself, remained in bondage. As he puts it, he guesses he\r\ncould be called a 'conductor' on the underground railway, \"only we didn't\r\ncall it that then. I don't know as we called it anything--we just knew\r\nthere was a lot of slaves always a-wantin' to get free, and I had to\r\nhelp 'em.\")\r\n\r\n\"Most of the slaves didn't know when they was born, but I did. You see,\r\nI was born on a Christmas mornin'--it was in 1840; I was a full grown\r\nman when I finally got my freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before I got it, though, I helped a lot of others get theirs. Lawd only\r\nknows how many; might have been as much as two-three hundred. It was\r\n'way more than a hundred, I know.\r\n\r\n\"But that all came after I was a young man--'grown' enough to know a\r\npretty girl when I saw one, and to go chasing after her, too. I was born\r\non a plantation that b'longed to Mr. Jack Tabb in Mason County, just\r\nacross the river in Kentucky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Tabb was a pretty good man. He used to beat us, sure; but not\r\nnearly so much as others did, some of his own kin people, even. But he\r\nwas kinda funny sometimes; he used to have a special slave who didn't\r\nhave nothin' to do but teach the rest of us--we had about ten on the\r\nplantation, and a lot on the other plantations near us--how to read and\r\nwrite and figger. Mr. Tabb liked us to know how to figger. But sometimes\r\nwhen he would send for us and we would be a long time comin', he would\r\nask us where we had been. If we told him we had been learnin' to read,\r\nhe would near beat the daylights out of us--after gettin' somebody to\r\nteach us; I think he did some of that so that the other owners wouldn't\r\nsay he was spoilin' his slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was funny about us marryin', too. He would let us go a-courtin' on\r\nthe other plantations near anytime we liked, if we were good, and if we\r\nfound somebody we wanted to marry, and she was on a plantation that\r\nb'longed to one of his kin folks or a friend, he would swap a slave so\r\nthat the husband and wife could be together. Sometimes, when he couldn't\r\ndo this, he would let a slave work all day on his plantation, and live\r\nwith his wife at night on her plantation. Some of the other owners was\r\nalways talking about his spoilin' us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wasn't a Dimmacrat like the rest of 'em in the county; he belonged\r\nto the 'know-nothin' party' and he was a real leader in it. He used to\r\nalways be makin' speeches, and sometimes his best friends wouldn't be\r\nspeaking to him for days at a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Tabb was always specially good to me. He used to let me go all\r\nabout--I guess he had to; couldn't get too much work out of me even when\r\nhe kept me right under his eyes. I learned fast, too, and I think he\r\nkinda liked that. He used to call Sandy Davis, the slave who taught me,\r\n'the smartest Nigger in Kentucky.'\r\n\r\n\"It was 'cause he used to let me go around in the day and night so much\r\nthat I came to be the one who carried the runnin' away slaves over the\r\nriver. It was funny the way I started it too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't have no idea of ever gettin' mixed up in any sort of business\r\nlike that until one special night. I hadn't even thought of rowing\r\nacross the river myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But one night I had gone on another plantation 'courtin,' and the old\r\nwoman whose house I went to told me she had a real pretty girl there who\r\nwanted to go across the river and would I take her? I was scared and\r\nbacked out in a hurry. But then I saw the girl, and she was such a\r\npretty little thing, brown-skinned and kinda rosy, and looking as scared\r\nas I was feelin', so it wasn't long before I was listenin' to the old\r\nwoman tell me when to take her and where to leave her on the other\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't have nerve enough to do it that night, though, and I told them\r\nto wait for me until tomorrow night. All the next day I kept seeing\r\nMister Tabb laying a rawhide across my back, or shootin' me, and kept\r\nseeing that scared little brown girl back at the house, looking at me\r\nwith her big eyes and asking me if I wouldn't just row her across to\r\nRipley. Me and Mr. Tabb lost, and soon as dust settled that night, I was\r\nat the old lady's house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how I ever rowed the boat across the river the current\r\nwas strong and I was trembling. I couldn't see a thing there in the\r\ndark, but I felt that girl's eyes. We didn't dare to whisper, so I\r\ncouldn't tell her how sure I was that Mr. Tabb or some of the others\r\nowners would 'tear me up' when they found out what I had done. I just\r\nknew they would find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was worried, too, about where to put her out of the boat. I couldn't\r\nride her across the river all night, and I didn't know a thing about the\r\nother side. I had heard a lot about it from other slaves but I thought\r\nit was just about like Mason County, with slaves and masters, overseers\r\nand rawhides; and so, I just knew that if I pulled the boat up and went\r\nto asking people where to take her I would get a beating or get killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether it seemed like a long time or a short time,\r\nnow--it's so long ago; I know it was a long time rowing there in the\r\ncold and worryin'. But it was short, too, 'cause as soon as I did get on\r\nthe other side the big-eyed, brown-skin girl would be gone. Well, pretty\r\nsoon I saw a tall light and I remembered what the old lady had told me\r\nabout looking for that light and rowing to it. I did; and when I got up\r\nto it, two men reached down and grabbed her; I started tremblin' all\r\nover again, and prayin'. Then, one of the men took my arm and I just\r\nfelt down inside of me that the Lord had got ready for me. 'You hungry,\r\nBoy?' is what he asked me, and if he hadn't been holdin' me I think I\r\nwould have fell backward into the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was my first trip; it took me a long time to get over my scared\r\nfeelin', but I finally did, and I soon found myself goin' back across\r\nthe river, with two and three people, and sometimes a whole boatload. I\r\ngot so I used to make three and four trips a month.\r\n\r\n\"What did my passengers look like? I can't tell you any more about it\r\nthan you can, and you wasn't there. After that first girl--no, I never\r\ndid see her again--I never saw my passengers. I would have to be the\r\n\"black nights\" of the moon when I would carry them, and I would meet 'em\r\nout in the open or in a house without a single light. The only way I\r\nknew who they were was to ask them; \"What you say?\" And they would\r\nanswer, \"Menare.\" I don't know what that word meant--it came from the\r\nBible. I only know that that was the password I used, and all of them\r\nthat I took over told it to me before I took them.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you wonder what I did with them after I got them over the\r\nriver. Well, there in Ripley was a man named Mr. Rankins; I think the\r\nrest of his name was John. He had a regular station there on his place\r\nfor escaping slaves. You see, Ohio was a free state and once they got\r\nover the river from Kentucky or Virginia. Mr. Rankins could strut them\r\nall around town, and nobody would bother 'em. The only reason we used to\r\nland quietly at night was so that whoever brought 'em could go back for\r\nmore, and because we had to be careful that none of the owners had\r\nfollowed us. Every once in a while they would follow a boat and catch\r\ntheir slaves back. Sometimes they would shoot at whoever was trying to\r\nsave the poor devils.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rankins had a regular 'station' for the slaves. He had a big\r\nlighthouse in his yard, about thirty feet high and he kept it burnin'\r\nall night. It always meant freedom for slave if he could get to this\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes Mr. Rankins would have twenty or thirty slaves that had run\r\naway on his place at the time. It must have cost him a whole lots to\r\nkeep them and feed 'em, but I think some of his friends helped him.\r\n\r\n\"Those who wanted to stay around that part of Ohio could stay, but\r\ndidn't many of 'em do it, because there was too much danger that you\r\nwould be walking along free one night, feel a hand over your mouth, and\r\nbe back across the river and in slavery again in the morning. And nobody\r\nin the world ever got a chance to know as much misery as a slave that\r\nhad escaped and been caught.\r\n\r\n\"So a whole lot of 'em went on North to other parts of Ohio, or to New\r\nYork, Chicago or Canada; Canada was popular then because all of the\r\nslaves thought it was the last gate before you got all the way _inside_\r\nof heaven. I don't think there was much chance for a slave to make a\r\nliving in Canada, but didn't many of 'em come back. They seem like they\r\nrather starve up there in the cold than to be back in slavery.\r\n\r\n\"The Army soon started taking a lot of 'em, too. They could enlist in\r\nthe Union Army and get good wages, more food than they ever had, and\r\nhave all the little gals wavin' at 'em when they passed. Them blue\r\nuniforms was a nice change, too.\r\n\r\n\"No, I never got anything from a single one of the people I carried over\r\nthe river to freedom. I didn't want anything; after had made a few trips\r\nI got to like it, and even though I could have been free any night\r\nmyself, I figgered I wasn't getting along so bad so I would stay on Mr.\r\nTabb's place and help the others get free. I did it for four years.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know to this day how he never knew what I was doing; I used to\r\ntake some awful chances, and he knew I must have been up to something; I\r\nwouldn't do much work in the day, would never be in my house at night,\r\nand when he would happen to visit the plantation where I had said I was\r\ngoin' I wouldn't be there. Sometimes I think he did know and wanted me\r\nto get the slaves away that way so he wouldn't have to cause hard\r\nfeelins' by freein 'em.\r\n\r\n\"I think Mr. Tabb used to talk a lot to Mr. John Fee; Mr. Fee was a man\r\nwho lived in Kentucky, but Lord! how that man hated slavery! He used to\r\nalways tell us (we never let our owners see us listenin' to him, though)\r\nthat God didn't intend for some men to be free and some men be in\r\nslavery. He used to talk to the owners, too, when they would listen to\r\nhim, but mostly they hated the sight of John Fee.\r\n\r\n\"In the night, though, he was a different man, for every slave who came\r\nthrough his place going across the river he had a good word, something\r\nto eat and some kind of rags, too, if it was cold. He always knew just\r\nwhat to tell you to do if anything went wrong, and sometimes I think he\r\nkept slaves there on his place 'till they could be rowed across the\r\nriver. Helped us a lot.\r\n\r\n\"I almost ran the business in the ground after I had been carrying the\r\nslaves across for nearly four years. It was in 1863, and one night I\r\ncarried across about twelve on the same night. Somebody must have seen\r\nus, because they set out after me as soon as I stepped out of the boat\r\nback on the Kentucky side; from that time on they were after me.\r\nSometimes they would almost catch me; I had to run away from Mr. Tabb's\r\nplantation and live in the fields and in the woods. I didn't know what a\r\nbed was from one week to another. I would sleep in a cornfield tonight,\r\nup in the branches of a tree tomorrow night, and buried in a haypile the\r\nnext night; the River, where I had carried so many across myself, was no\r\ngood to me; it was watched too close.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, I saw that I could never do any more good in Mason County, so\r\nI decided to take my freedom, too. I had a wife by this time, and one\r\nnight we quietly slipped across and headed for Mr. Rankin's bell and\r\nlight. It looked like we had to go almost to China to get across that\r\nriver: I could hear the bell and see the light on Mr. Rankin's place,\r\nbut the harder I rowed, the farther away it got, and I knew if I didn't\r\nmake it I'd get killed. But finally, I pulled up by the lighthouse, and\r\nwent on to my freedom--just a few months before all of the slaves got\r\ntheir's. I didn't stay in Ripley, though; I wasn't taking no chances. I\r\nwent on to Detroit and still live there with most of 10 children and 31\r\ngrandchildren.\r\n\r\n\"The bigger ones don't care so much about hearin' it now, but the little\r\nones never get tired of hearin' how their grandpa brought Emancipation\r\nto loads of slaves he could touch and feel, but never could see.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1.

We played and\r\net and fit togetter lak chillen is bound ter do all over der world.\r\nSomethin allus happened though to remind me dat I was jist a piece of\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard der gun aboomin' away at Fort Sumpter and fer de firs' time in\r\nmy life I knowed what it was ter fear anythin' cept a sperrit.

Its contents in ink are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nHarriett Pinckney, born September 25, 1790. Adeline, her daughter, born\r\nOctober 1, 1809. Betsy, her daughter, born September 11, 1811.

(This record was given\r\nHarriett by Mrs. Harriett Bellinger, her mistress. Each slave received a\r\nsimilar one on being freed.)\r\n\r\nAs a child Harriett played about the premises of the Bellinger estate,\r\nleading a very carefree life as did all the slave children belonging to\r\nEdmond Bellinger. When she was about twelve years old she was given\r\nsmall tasks to do such as knitting a pair of stockings or dusting the\r\nfurniture and ample time was given for each of these assignments.\r\n\r\nThis was a very large plantation and there was always something for the\r\nscore of slaves to do. There were the wide acres of cotton that must be\r\nplanted, hoed and gathered by hand. A special batch of slave women did\r\nthe spinning and weaving, while those who had been taught to sew, made\r\nmost of the clothing worn by slaves at that time.\r\n\r\nOther products grown here were rice, corn, sugarcane, fruits and\r\nvegetables. Much of the food grown on the plantation was reserved to\r\nfeed the slaves. While they must work hard to complete their tasks in a\r\ngiven time, no one was allowed to go hungry or forced to work if the\r\nleast ill.\r\n\r\nVery little had to be bought here. Candles ware made in the kitchen of\r\nthe \"big house,\" usually by the cook who was helped by other slaves.\r\nThese were made of beeswax gathered on the plantation. Shoes were made\r\nof tanned dried leather and re-inforced with brass caps; the large herds\r\nof cattle, hogs and poultry furnished sufficient meat. Syrup and sugar\r\nwere made from the cane that was carried to a neighboring mill.\r\n\r\nHarriett remembers her master as being exceptionally kind but very\r\nsevere when his patience was tried too far. Mrs. Bellinger was dearly\r\nloved by all her slaves because she was very thoughtful of them.\r\nWhenever there was a wedding, frolic or holiday or quilting bee, she\r\nwas sure to provide some extra \"goody\" and so dear to the hearts of the\r\nwomen were the cast off clothes she so often bestowed upon them on these\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nThe slaves were free to invite those from the neighboring plantations to\r\njoin in their social gatherings. A Negro preacher delivered sermons on\r\nthe plantation. Services being held in the church used by whites after\r\ntheir services on Sunday. The preacher must always act as a peacemaker\r\nand mouthpiece for the master, so they were told to be subservient to\r\ntheir masters in order to enter the Kingdom of God. But the slaves held\r\nsecret meetings and had praying grounds where they met a few at a time\r\nto pray for better things.\r\n\r\nHarriett remembers little about the selling of slaves because this was\r\nnever done on the Bellinger plantation. All slaves were considered a\r\npart of the estate and to sell one, meant that it was no longer intact.\r\n\r\nThere were rumors of the war but the slaves on the Bellinger place did\r\nnot grasp the import of the war until their master went to fight on the\r\nside of the Rebel army. Many of them gathered about their mistress and\r\nwept as he left the home to which he would never return. Soon after that\r\nit was whispered among the slaves that they would be free, but no one\r\nran away.\r\n\r\nAfter living in plenty all their lives, they were forced to do without\r\ncoffee, sugar salt and beef. Everything available was bundled off to\r\nthe army by Mrs. Bellinger who shared the popular belief that the\r\nsoldiers must have the best in the way of food and clothing.\r\n\r\nHarriett still remembers very clearly the storming of Fort Sumpter. The\r\nwhole countryside was thrown into confusion and many slaves were mad\r\nwith fear. There were few men left to establish order and many women\r\nloaded their slaves into wagons and gathered such belongings as they\r\ncould and fled. Mrs. Bellinger was one of those who held their ground.\r\n\r\nWhen the Union soldiers visited her plantation they found the plantation\r\nin perfect order. The slaves going about their tasks as if nothing\r\nunusual had happened. It was necessary to summon them from the fields to\r\ngive them the message of their freedom.\r\n\r\nHarriett recalls that her mistress was very frightened but walked\r\nupright and held a trembling lip between her teeth as they waited for\r\nher to sound for the last time the horn that had summoned several\r\ngenerations of human chattel to and from work.\r\n\r\nSome left the plantation; others remained to harvest the crops. One and\r\nall they remembered to thank God for their freedom. They immediately\r\nbegan to hold meetings, singing soul stirring spirituals. Harriett\r\nrecalls one of these songs. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  T'ank ye Marster Jesus, t'ank ye,\r\n  T'ank ye Marster Jesus, t'ank ye,\r\n  T'ank ye Marster Jesus, t'ank ye\r\n  Da Heben gwinter be my home.\r\n  No slav'ry chains to tie me down,\r\n  And no mo' driver's ho'n to blow fer me\r\n  No mo' stocks to fasten me down\r\n  Jesus break slav'ry chain, Lord\r\n  Break slav'ry chain Lord,\r\n  Break slav'ry chain Lord,\r\n  Da Heben gwinter be my home.\r\n\r\nHarriett's parents remained with the widowed woman for a while. Had they\r\nnot remained, she might not have met Gaylord Jeannette, the knight in\r\nBlue, who later became her husband. He was a member of Company \"I\", 35th\r\nRegiment. She is still a bit breathless when she relates the details of\r\nthe military wedding that followed a whirlwind courtship which had its\r\nbeginning on the citadel green, where the soldiers stationed there held\r\ntheir dress parade. After these parades there was dancing by the\r\nsoldiers and belles who had bedecked themselves in their Sunday best and\r\ncome out to be wooed by a soldier in blue.\r\n\r\nMusic was furnished by the military band which offered many patriotic\r\nnumbers that awakened in the newly freed Negroes that had long been\r\ndead--patriotism. Harriett recalls snatches of one of these songs to\r\nwhich she danced when she was 20 years of age. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Don't you see the lightning flashing in the cane brakes,\r\n  Looks like we gonna have a storm\r\n  Although you're mistaken its the Yankee soldiers\r\n  Going to fight for Uncle Sam.\r\n  Old master was a colonel in the Rebel army\r\n  Just before he had to run away--\r\n  Look out the battle is a-falling\r\n  The darkies gonna occupy the land.\r\n\r\nHarriett believes the two officers who tendered congratulations shortly\r\nafter her marriage to have been Generals Gates and Beecher. This was an\r\nadded thrill to her.\r\n\r\nAs she lived a rather secluded life, Harriett Gresham can tell very\r\nlittle about the superstitions of her people during slavery, but knew\r\nthem to be very reverent of various signs and omens. In one she places\r\nmuch credence herself. Prior to the Civil War, there were hordes of ants\r\nand everyone said this was an omen of war, and there was a war.\r\n\r\nShe was married when schools were set up for Negroes, but had no time\r\nfor school. Her master was adamant on one point and that was the danger\r\nof teaching a slave to read and write, so Harriett received little \"book\r\nlearning.\"\r\n\r\nHarriett Gresham is the mother of several children, grandchildren and\r\ngreat grandchildren. Many of them are dead. She lives at 1305 west 31st\r\nStreet, Jacksonville, Florida with a grand daughter. Her second husband\r\nis also dead. She sits on the porch of her shabby cottage and sews the\r\nstitches that were taught her by her mistress, who is also dead. She\r\nembroiders, crochets, knits and quilts without the aid of glasses. She\r\nlikes to show her handiwork to passersby who will find themselves\r\nlistening to some of her reminiscences if they linger long enough to\r\nengage her in conversation--for she loves to talk of the past.\r\n\r\nShe still corresponds with one of the children of her mistress, now an\r\nold woman living on what is left of a once vast estate at Barnwell,\r\nSouth Carolina. The two old women are very much attached to each other\r\nand each in her letters helps to keep alive the memories of the life\r\nthey shared together as mistress and slave.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1.

The Halls\r\nwho were the slaves of Thomas Lenton, owner of seventy-five or a hundred\r\nslaves, were the parents of twenty-one children. The Halls, who were\r\nborn before slavery worked on the large plantation of Lenton which was\r\ndevoted primarily to the growing of cotton and corn and secondarily to\r\nthe growing of tobacco and pumpkins. Lenton was very good to his slaves\r\nand never whipped them unless it was absolutely necessary--which was\r\nseldom! He provided them with plenty of food and clothing, and always\r\nsaw to it that their cabins were liveable. He was careful, however, to\r\nsee that they received no educational training, but did not interfere\r\nwith their religious quest. The slaves were permitted to attend church\r\nwith their masters to hear the white preacher, and occasionally the\r\nmaster--supposedly un-beknown to the slaves--would have an itinerant\r\ncolored minister preach to the slaves, instructing them to obey their\r\nmaster and mistress at all times. Although freedom came to the slaves in\r\nJanuary, Master Lenton kept them until May in order to help him with his\r\ncrops. When actual freedom was granted to the slaves, only a few of the\r\nyoung ones left the Lenton plantation. In 1882 Bolden Hall came to Live\r\nOak where he has resided ever since. He married but his wife is now\r\ndead, and to that union one child was born.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharlotte Martin\r\n\r\nCharlotte Mitchell Martin, one of twenty children born to Shepherd and\r\nLucinda Mitchell, eighty-two years ago, was a slave of Judge Wilkerson\r\non a large plantation in Sixteen, Florida, a little town near Madison.\r\nShepherd Mitchell was a wagoner who hauled whiskey from Newport News,\r\nVirginia for his owner. Wilkerson was very cruel and held them in\r\nconstant fear of him. He would not permit them to hold religious\r\nmeetings or any other kinds of meetings, but they frequently met in\r\nsecret to conduct religious services. When they were caught, the\r\n\"instigators\"--known or suspected--were severely flogged. Charlotte\r\nrecalls how her oldest brother was whipped to death for taking part in\r\none of the religious ceremonies. This cruel act halted the secret\r\nreligious services.\r\n\r\nWilkerson found it very profitable to raise and sell slaves. He\r\nselected the strongest and best male and female slaves and mated them\r\nexclusively for breeding. The huskiest babies were given the best of\r\nattention in order that they might grow into sturdy youths, for it was\r\nthose who brought the highest prices at the slave markets. Sometimes the\r\nmaster himself had sexual relations with his female slaves, for the\r\nproducts of miscegenation were very remunerative. These offsprings were\r\nin demand as house servants.\r\n\r\nAfter slavery the Mitchells began to separate. A few of the children\r\nremained with their parents and eked out their living from the soil.\r\nDuring this period Charlotte began to attract attention with her herb\r\ncures. Doctors sought her out when they were stumped by difficult cases.\r\nShe came to Live Oak to care for an old colored woman and upon whose\r\ndeath she was given the woman's house and property. For many years she\r\nhas resided in the old shack, farming, making quilts, and practicing her\r\nherb doctoring. She has outlived her husband for whom she bore two\r\nchildren. Her daughter is feebleminded--her herb remedies can't cure\r\nher!\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Ross\r\n\r\nBorn in Benton County, Mississippi nearly eighty years ago, Sarah is the\r\ndaughter of Harriet Elmore and William Donaldson, her white owner.\r\nDonaldson was a very cruel man and frequently beat Sarah's mother\r\nbecause she would not have sexual relations with the overseer, a colored\r\nman by the name of Randall. Sarah relates that the slaves did not marry,\r\nbut were forced--in many cases against their will--to live together as\r\nman and wife. It was not until after slavery that they learned about the\r\nholy bonds of matrimony, and many of them actually married.\r\n\r\nCotton, corn, and rice were the chief products grown on the Donaldson\r\nplantation. Okra also was grown, and from this product coffee was made.\r\nThe slaves arose with the sun to begin their tasks in the fields and\r\nworked until dusk. They were beaten by the overseer if they dared to\r\nrest themselves. No kind of punishment was too cruel or severe to be\r\ninflicted upon these souls in bondage. Frequently the thighs of the male\r\nslaves were gashed with a saw and salt put in the wound as a means of\r\npunishment for some misdemeanor. The female slaves often had their hair\r\ncut off, especially those who had long beautiful hair. If a female slave\r\nwas pregnant and had to be punished, she was whipped about the\r\nshoulders, not so much in pity as for the protection of the unborn\r\nchild. Donaldson's wife committed suicide because of the cruelty not\r\nonly to the slaves but to her as well.\r\n\r\nThe slaves were not permitted to hold any sort of meeting, not even to\r\nworship God. Their work consumed so much of their time that they had\r\nlittle opportunity to congregate. They had to wash their clothes on\r\nSunday, the only day which they could call their own. On Sunday\r\nafternoon some of the slaves were sent for to entertain the family and\r\nits guests.\r\n\r\nSarah remembers the coming of the Yankees and the destruction wrought by\r\ntheir appearance. The soldiers stripped the plantation owners of their\r\nmeats, vegetables, poultry and the like. Many plantation owners took\r\ntheir own lives in desperation. Donaldson kept his slaves several months\r\nafter liberation and defied them to mention freedom to him. When he did\r\ngive them freedom, they lost no time in leaving his plantation which\r\nheld for them only unpleasant memories. Sarah came to Florida\r\nthirty-five years ago. She has been married twice, and is the mother of\r\nten children, eight of whom are living.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1.

The mother was the mulatto offspring of\r\nWilliam Lowe and a slave woman who was half Cherokee. The father was\r\nalso a mulatto, purchased from a nearby plantation.\r\n\r\nBecause of this blood mixture Rebecca's parents were known as \"house\r\nniggers,\" and lived on quarters located in the rear of the \"big house.\"\r\nA \"house nigger\" was a servant whose duties consisted of chores around\r\nthe big house, such as butler, maid, cook, stableman, gardner and\r\npersonal attendant to the man who owned him.\r\n\r\nThese slaves were often held in high esteem by their masters and of\r\ncourse fared much better than the other slaves on the plantation. Quite\r\noften they were mulattoes as in the case of Rebecca's parents. There\r\nseemed to be a general belief among slave owners that mulattoes could\r\nnot stand as much laborious work as pure blooded Negro slaves. This\r\naccounts probably for the fact that the majority of ex-slaves now alive\r\nare mulattoes.\r\n\r\nThe Lowes were originally of Virginia and did not own as much property\r\nin Georgia as they had in Virginia. Rebecca estimates the number of\r\nslaves on this plantation as numbering no more than 25.\r\n\r\nThey were treated kindly and cruelly by turns, according to the whims of\r\na master and mistress who were none too stable in their dispositions.\r\nThere was no \"driver\" or overseer on this plantation, as \"Old Tom was\r\ndevil enough himself when he wanted to be,\" observes Rebecca. While she\r\nnever felt the full force of his cruelties, she often felt sorry for the\r\nother slaves who were given a task too heavy to be completed in the\r\ngiven time; this deliberately, so that the master might have some excuse\r\nto vent his pentup feelings. Punishment was always in the form of a\r\nsevere whipping or revocation of a slave's privilege, such as visiting\r\nother plantations etc.\r\n\r\nThe Lowes were not wealthy and it was necessary for them to raise and\r\nmanufacture as many things on the plantation as possible. Slaves toiled\r\nfrom early morning until night in the corn, cotton sugar cane and\r\ntobacco fields. Others tended the large herds of cattle from which milk,\r\nbutter, meat and leather was produced. The leather was tanned and made\r\ninto crude shoes for the slaves for the short winter months. No one wore\r\nshoes except during cold weather and on Sundays. Fruit orchards and\r\nvegetables were also grown, but not given as much attention as the\r\ncotton and corn, as these were the main money crops.\r\n\r\nAs a child Rebecca learned to ape the ways of her mistress. At first\r\nthis was considered very amusing. Whenever she had not knitted her\r\nrequired number of socks during the week, she simply informed them that\r\nshe had not done it because she had not wanted to--besides she was not a\r\n\"nigger.\" This stubbornness accompanied by hysterical tantrums continued\r\nto cause Rebecca to receive many stiff punishments that might have been\r\navoided. Her master had given orders that no one was ever to whip her,\r\nso devious methods were employed to punish her, such as marching her\r\ndown the road with hands tied behind her back, or locking her in a dark\r\nroom for several hours with only bread and water.\r\n\r\nRebecca resembled very much a daughter of William Lowe. The girl was\r\nreally her aunt, and very conscious of the resemblance. Both had brown\r\neyes and long dark hair. They were about the same height and the clothes\r\nof the young mistress fitted Rebecca \"like a glove.\" To offset this\r\nlikeness, Rebecca's hair was always cut very short. Finally Rebecca\r\nrebelled at having her hair all cut off and blankly refused to submit to\r\nthe treatment any longer. After this happening, the girls formed a\r\ndislike for each other, and Rebecca was guilty of doing every mean act\r\nof which she was capable to torment the white girl. Rebecca's mother\r\naided and abetted her in this, often telling her things to do. Rebecca\r\ndid not fear the form of punishment administered her and she had the\r\ncunning to keep \"on the good side of the master\" who had a fondness for\r\nher \"because she was so much like the Lowes.\" The mistress' demand that\r\nshe be sold or beaten was always turned aside with \"Dear, you know the\r\nchild can't help it; its that cursed Cherokee blood in her.\"\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no very strong opposition to a slave's learning to\r\nread and write on the plantation, so Rebecca learned along with the\r\nwhite children. Her father purchased books for her with money he was\r\nallowed to earn from the sale of corn whiskey which he made, or from\r\nwork done on some other plantation during his time off. He was not\r\npermitted to buy his freedom, however.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays Rebecca attended church along with the other slaves. Services\r\nwere held in the white churches after their services were over. They\r\nwere taught to obey their masters and work hard, and that they should be\r\nvery thankful for the institution of slavery which brought them from\r\ndarkest Africa.\r\n\r\nOn the plantation, the doctor was not nearly as popular as the \"granny\"\r\nor midwife, who brewed medicines for every ailment. Each plantation had\r\nits own \"granny\" who also served the mistress during confinement. Some\r\nof her remedies follows:\r\n\r\nFor colds: Horehound tea, pinetop tea, lightwood drippings on sugar.\r\nFor fever: A tea made of pomegranate seeds and crushed mint. For\r\nwhooping cough: A tea made of sheep shandy (manure); catnip tea. For\r\nspasms: garlic; burning a garment next to the skin of the patient having\r\nthe fit.\r\n\r\nShortly before the war, Rebecca was married to Solomon, her husband.\r\nThis ceremony consisted of simply jumping over a broom and having some\r\none read a few words from a book, which may or may not have been the\r\nBible. After the war, many couples were remarried because of this\r\nirregularity.\r\n\r\nRebecca had learned of the war long before it ended and knew its import.\r\nShe had confided this information to other slaves who could read and\r\nwrite. She read the small newspaper that her master received at\r\nirregular intervals. The two sons of William Lowe had gone to fight with\r\nthe Confederate soldiers (One never returned) and everywhere was felt\r\nthe tension caused by wild speculation as to the outcome of the war.\r\n\r\nCertain commodities were very scarce Rebecca remembers drinking coffee\r\nmade of okra seed, that had been dried and parched. There was no silk,\r\nexcept that secured by \"running the blockade,\" and this was very\r\nexpensive. The smokehouse floors were carefully scraped for any morsel\r\nof salt that might be gotten. Salt had to be evaporated from sea water\r\nand this was a slow process.\r\n\r\nThere were no disorders in that section as far as Rebecca remembers,\r\nbut she thinks that the slaves were kept on the Lowe plantation a long\r\ntime after they had been freed. It was only when rumors came that Union\r\nsoldiers were patrolling the countryside for such offenders, that they\r\nwere hastily told of their freedom. Their former master predicted that\r\nthey would fare much worse as freemen, and so many of them were afraid\r\nto venture into the world for themselves, remaining in virtual slavery\r\nfor many years afterward.\r\n\r\nRebecca and her husband were among those who left the plantation. They\r\nshare-cropped on various plantations until they came to Florida, which\r\nis more than fifty years ago. Rebecca's husband died several years ago\r\nand she now lives with two daughters, who are very proud of her.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\nPersonal interview with Rebecca Hooks, 1604 North Marion Street, Lake\r\nCity, Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nSamuel Johnson\r\nSeptember 11, 1937\r\n\r\nREV. SQUIRES JACKSON\r\n\r\n\r\nLying comfortably in a bed encased with white sheets, Rev. Squires\r\nJackson, former slave and minister of the gospel living at 706 Third\r\nStreet cheerfully related the story of his life.\r\n\r\nBorn in a weather-beaten shanty in Madison, Fla. September 14, 1841 of a\r\nlarge family, he moved to Jacksonville at the age of three with the\r\n\"Master\" and his mother.\r\n\r\nVery devoted to his mother, he would follow her into the cotton field as\r\nshe picked or hoed cotton, urged by the thrashing of the overseer's\r\nlash. His master, a prominent political figure of that time was very\r\nkind to his slaves, but would not permit them to read and write.\r\nRelating an incident after having learned to read and write, one day as\r\nhe was reading a newspaper, the master walked upon him unexpectingly and\r\ndemanded to know what he was doing with a newspaper. He immediately\r\nturned the paper upside down and declared \"Confederates done won the\r\nwar.\" The master laughed and walked away without punishing him. It la\r\ninteresting to know that slaves on this plantation were not allowed to\r\nsing when they were at work, but with all the vigilance of the\r\noverseers, nothing could stop those silent songs of labor and prayers\r\nfor freedom.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays the boys on the plantation would play home ball and shoot\r\nmarbles until church time. After church a hearty meal consisting of\r\nrice and salt picked pork was the usual Sunday fare cooked in large iron\r\npots hung over indoor hearths. Sometimes coffee, made out of parched\r\ncorn meal, was added as an extra treat.\r\n\r\nHe remembers the start of the Civil war with the laying of the Atlantic\r\nCable by the \"Great Eastern\" being nineteen years of age at the time.\r\nHearing threats of the War which was about to begin, he ran away with\r\nhis brother to Lake City, many times hiding in trees and groves from the\r\nposse that was looking for him. At night he would cover up his face and\r\nbody with spanish moss to sleep. One night he hid in a tree near a\r\ncreek, over-slept himself, in the morning a group of white women fishing\r\nnear the creek saw him and ran to tell the men, fortunately however he\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nAfter four days of wearied travelling being guided by the north star and\r\nthe Indian instinct inherited from his Indian grandmother, he finally\r\nreached Lake City. Later reporting to General Scott, he was informed\r\nthat he was to act as orderly until further ordered. On Saturday\r\nmorning, February 20, 1861, General Scott called him to his tent and\r\nsaid \"Squire; I have just had you appraised for $1000 and you are to\r\nreport to Col. Guist in Alachua County for service immediately.\" That\r\nvery night he ran away to Wellborn where the Federals were camping.\r\nThere in a horse stable were wounded colored soldiers stretched out on\r\nthe filthy ground. The sight of these wounded men and the feeble medical\r\nattention given them by the Federals was so repulsive to him, that he\r\ndecided that he didn't want to join the Federal Army. In the silent\r\nhours of the evening he stole away to Tallahassee, throughly convinced\r\nthat War wasn't the place for him. While in the horse shed make-shift\r\nhospital, a white soldier asked one of the wounded colored soldiers to\r\nwhat regiment he belonged, the negro replied \"54th Regiment,\r\nMassachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time, the only railroad was between Lake City and Tallahassee\r\nwhich he had worked on for awhile. At the close of the war he returned\r\nto Jacksonville to begin work as a bricklayer. During this period, Negro\r\nskilled help was very much in demand.\r\n\r\nThe first time he saw ice was in 1857 when a ship brought some into this\r\nport. Mr. Moody, a white man, opened an icehouse at the foot of Julia\r\nStreet. This was the only icehouse in the city at that time.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays he would attend church. One day he thought he heard the call\r\nof God beseeching him to preach. He began to preach in 1868, and was\r\nordained an elder in 1874.\r\n\r\nSome of the interesting facts obtained from this slave of the fourth\r\ngeneration were: (1) Salt was obtained by evaporating sea water, (2)\r\nthere were no regular stoves, (3) cooking was done by hanging iron pots\r\non rails in the fireplaces, (4) an open well was used to obtain water,\r\n(5) flour was sold at $12.00 a barrell, (6) \"shin-plasters\" was used for\r\nmoney, (7) the first buggy was called \"rockaways\" due to the elasticity\r\nof the leather-springs, (8) Rev. Jackson saw his first buggy as\r\ndescribed, in 1851.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War, cloth as well as all other commodities were very\r\nhigh. Slaves were required to weave the cloth. The women would delight\r\nin dancing as they marched to and fro in weaving the cloth by hand. This\r\nwas one kind of work the slaves enjoyed doing. Even Cotton seeds was\r\npicked by hand, hulling the seeds out with the fingers, there was no way\r\nof ginning it by machine at that time. Rev. Jackson vividly recalls the\r\ncroker-sacks being used around bales of the finer cotton, known as short\r\ncotton. During this same period he made all of the shoes he wore by hand\r\nfrom cow hides. The women slaves at that time wore grass shirts woven\r\nvery closely with hoops around on the inside to keep from contacting the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nGleefully he told of the Saturday night baths in big wooden washtubs\r\nwith cut out holes for the fingers during his boyhood, of the castor\r\noil, old fashion paragoric, calomel, and burmo chops used for medicine\r\nat that time. The herb doctors went from home to home during times of\r\nillness. Until many years after the Civil War there were no practicing\r\nNegro physicians. Soap was made by mixing bones and lard together,\r\nheating and then straining into a bucket containing alum, turpentine,\r\nand rosin. Lye soap was made by placing burnt ashes into straw with corn\r\nshucks placed into harper, water is poured over this mixture and a\r\ntrough is used to sieze the liquid that drips into the tub and let stand\r\nfor a day. Very little moss was used for mattresses, chicken feathers\r\nand goose feathers were the principal constituents during his boyhood.\r\nSoot mixed with water was the best medicine one could use for the\r\nstomach ache at that time.\r\n\r\nRev. Jackson married in 1882 and has seven sons and seven daughters.\r\nOwns his own home and plenty of other property around the neighborhood.\r\nNinety-six years of age and still feels as spry as a man of fifty, keen\r\nof wit, with a memory as good can be expected. This handsome bronze\r\npiece of humanity with snow-white beard over his beaming face ended the\r\ninterview saying, \"I am waiting now to hear the call of God to the\r\npromise land.\" He once was considered as a candidate for senator after\r\nthe Civil war but declined to run. He says that the treatment during the\r\ntime of slavery was very tough at times, but gathering himself up he\r\nsaid, \"no storm lasts forever\" and I had the faith and courage of Jesus\r\nto carry me on, continuing, \"even the best masters in slavery couldn't\r\nbe as good as the worst person in freedom, Oh, God, it is good to be\r\nfree, and I am thankful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\nPersonal interview with subject, Rev.

Rebecca Baker, Field Worker\r\nDaytona Beach, Florida\r\nJanuary 11, 1937\r\n\r\n\"PROPHET\" JOHN HENRY KEMP\r\n\r\n\r\nA long grey beard, a pair of piercing owl-like eyes and large bare feet,\r\nmark \"Prophet\" Kemp among the citizenry of Daytona Beach, Florida. The\r\n\"Prophet\", christened John Henry--as nearly as he can remember--is an 80\r\nyear old ex-slave whose remininiscences of the past, delight all those\r\nwho can prevail upon him to talk of his early life on the plantation of\r\nthe section.\r\n\r\n\"Prophet\" Kemp does not talk only of the past, however, his conversation\r\nturns to the future; he believes himself to be equally competent to talk\r\nof the future, and talks more of the latter if permitted.\r\n\r\nOketibbeha County, Mississippi was the birthplace of the \"Prophet\". The\r\nfirst master he can remember was John Gay, owner of a plantation of some\r\n2,700 acres and over 100 slaves and a heavy drinker. The \"Prophet\" calls\r\nGay \"father\", and becomes very vague when asked if this title is a blood\r\ntie or a name of which he is generally known.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kemp--Gay was one of the meanest plantation owners in the\r\nentire section, and frequently voiced his pride in being able to employ\r\nthe cruelest overseers that could be found in all Mississippi. Among\r\nthese were such men as G.T. Turner, Nels T. Thompson, Billy Hole, Andrew\r\nWinston and other men with statewide reputations for brutality. When all\r\nof the cruelties of one overseer had been felt by the slaves on the Gay\r\nplantation and another meaner man's reputation was heard of on the Gay\r\nplantation, the master would delight in telling his slaves that if they\r\ndid not behave, he would send for this man. \"Behaving\"--the \"Prophet\"\r\nsays, meant living on less food than one should have; mating only at his\r\ncommand and for purposes purely of breeding more and stronger slaves on\r\nhis plantation for sale. In some cases with women--subjecting to his\r\nevery demand if they would escape hanging by the wrists for half a day\r\nor being beaten with a cowhide whip.\r\n\r\nAbout these whippings, the \"Prophet\" tells many a blood-curdling tale.\r\n\r\n\"One day when an old woman was plowing in the field, an overseer came by\r\nand reprimanded her for being so slow--she gave him some back talk, he\r\ntook out a long closely woven whip and lashed her severely. The woman\r\nbecame sore and took her hoe and chopped him right across his head, and\r\nchild you should have seen how she chopped this man to a bloody death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prophet\" Kemp will tell you that he hates to tell these things to any\r\ninvestigator, because he hates for people to know just how mean his\r\n\"fahter\" really was.\r\n\r\nSo great was the fear in which Gay was held that when Kemp's mother,\r\nArnette Young, complained to Mrs. Gay, that her husband was constantly\r\nseeking her for a mistress and threatening her with death if she did not\r\nsubmit, even Mrs. Gay had to advise the slaves to do as Gay demanded,\r\nsaying--\"My husband is a dirty man and will find some reason to kill you\r\nif you don't.\" \"I can't do a thing with him.\" Since Arnette worked at\r\nthe \"big house\" there was no alternative, and it was believed that out\r\nof the union with her master, Henry was born. A young slave by the name\r\nof Broxton Kemp was given to the woman as husband at the time John Kemp\r\nwas born, it is from this man that \"Prophet\" took his name.\r\n\r\nLife on the plantation held nothing but misery for the slaves of John\r\nGay. A week's allowance of groceries for the average small family\r\nconsisted of a package of about ten pounds containing crudely ground\r\nmeal, a slab of bacon--called side-meat and from a pint to a quart of\r\nsyrup made from sorghum, depending upon the season.\r\n\r\nAll slaves reported for work a 5 o'clock in the morning, except those\r\nwho cared for the overseer, who began their work an hour earlier to\r\nenable the overseer to be present at the morning checkup. This checkup\r\ndetermined which slaves were late or who had committed some offense late\r\non the day before or during the night. These were singled out and before\r\nthe rest of the slaves began their work they were treated to the sight\r\nof these delinquents being stripped and beaten until blood flowed; women\r\nwere no exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nThe possible loss of his slaves upon the declaration of freedom on\r\nJanuary 1, 1866 caused Gay considerable concern. His liquor-ridden mind\r\nwas not long in finding a solution, however, he barred all visitors from\r\nhis plantation and insisted that his overseers see to the carrying out\r\nof this detail. They did, with such efficiency that it was not until May\r\n8, when the government finally learned of the condition and sent a\r\nmarshall to the plantation, that freedom came to Gay's slaves. May 8, is\r\nstill celebrated in this section of Mississippi, as the official\r\nemancipation day.\r\n\r\nRelief for the hundreds of slaves of Gay came at last with the\r\ndeclaration of freedom for them. The government officials divided the\r\ngrown and growing crops; and some land was parcelled out to the former\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nKemp may have gained the name \"Prophet\" from his constant reference to\r\nthe future and to his religion. He says he believes on one faith, one\r\nLord and one religion, and preaches this belief constantly. He claims to\r\nhave turned his back on all religions that \"do not do as the Lord says.\"\r\n\r\nIn keeping this belief he says he represents the \"True Primitive Baptist\r\nChurch\", but does not have any connection with that church, because he\r\nbelieves it has not lived exactly up to what the Lord expects of him.\r\n\r\nKemp claims the ability to read the future with ease; even to help\r\ndetermine what it will bring in some cases. He reads it in the palms of\r\nthose who will believe in him; he determines the good and bad luck;\r\nfreedom from sickness; success in love and other benefits it will bring\r\nfrom the use of charms, roots, herbs and magical incantations and\r\nformulae. He has recently celebrated what he believes to be his 80th\r\nbirthday, and says he expects to live at least another quarter of a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1.

Muse, Field Worker\r\nPalatka, Florida\r\n\r\nRANDALL LEE\r\n\r\n\r\nRandall Lee of 500 Branson Street, Palatka, Florida, was born at Camden,\r\nSouth Carolina about seventy-seven years ago, maybe longer.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of Robert and Delhia Lee, who during slavery were Robert\r\nand Delhia Miller, taking the name of their master, as was the custom.\r\n\r\nHis master was Doctor Miller and his mistress was Mrs. Camilla Miller.\r\nHe does not know his master's given name as no other name was ever heard\r\naround the plantation except Doctor Miller.\r\n\r\nRandall was a small boy when the war between the states broke out, but\r\njudging from what he remembers he must have been a boy around six or\r\nseven years of age.\r\n\r\nDuring the few years he spent in slavery, Randall had many experiences\r\nwhich made such deep impressions upon his brain that the memory of them\r\nstill remains clear.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that causes one to believe that he must have been around\r\nseven years of age is the statement that he was not old enough to have\r\ntasks of any importance placed upon him, yet he was trusted along with\r\nanother boy about his own age, to carry butter from the plantation dairy\r\ntwo miles to the 'big house.' No one would trust a child younger than\r\nsix years of age to handle butter for fear of it being dropped into the\r\ndirt. He must have at least reached the age when he was sent two miles\r\nwith a package and was expected to deliver the package intact. He must\r\nhave understood the necessity of not playing on the way. He stated that\r\nhe knew not to stop on the two-mile journey and not to let the butter\r\nget dirty.\r\n\r\nRandall had the pleasure of catching the pig for his father for Doctor\r\nMiller gave each of his best Negro men a pig to raise for himself and\r\nfamily. He was allowed to build a pen for it and raise and fatten it for\r\nkilling. When killing time came he was given time to butcher it and\r\ngrind all the sausage he could make to feed his family. By that method\r\nit helped to solve the feeding problem and also satisfied the slaves.\r\n\r\nIt was more like so many families living around a big house with a boss\r\nlooking over them, for they were allowed a privilege that very few\r\nmasters gave their slaves.\r\n\r\nOn the Miller plantation there was a cotton gin. Doctor Miller owned the\r\ngin and it was operated by his slaves. He grew the cotton, picked it,\r\nginned it and wove it right there. He also had a baler and made the\r\nbagging to bale it with. He only had to buy the iron bands that held the\r\nbales intact.\r\n\r\nDoctor Miller was a rich man and had a far reaching sight into how to\r\nwork slaves to the best advantage. He was kind to them and knew that the\r\nbest way to get the best out of men was to keep them well and happy. His\r\narrangement was very much the general way in that he allowed the young\r\nmen and women to work in the fields and the old women and a few old men\r\nto work around the house, in the gin and at the loom. The old women\r\nmostly did the spinning of thread and weaving of cloth although in some\r\ninstances Doctor Miller found a man who was better adapted to weaving\r\nthan any of his women slaves.\r\n\r\nEveryone kept his plantation under fence and men who were old but strong\r\nand who had some knowledge of carpentry were sent out to keep the fence\r\nin repair and often to build new ones. The fences were not like those of\r\ntoday. They were built of horizontal rails about six or seven feet long,\r\nrunning zig-zag fashion. Instead of having straight line fences and\r\nposts at regular points they did not use posts at all. The bottom rails\r\nrested upon the ground and the zig-zag fashion in which they were laid\r\ngave strength to the fence. No nails were used to hold the rails in\r\nplace. If stock was to be let in or out of the places the planks were\r\nunlocked so to speak, and the stock allowed to enter after which they\r\nwere laid back as before.\r\n\r\nBoys and girls under ten years of age were never sent into the field to\r\nwork on the Miller plantation but were required to mind the smaller\r\nchildren of the family and do chores around the \"big house\" for the\r\nmistress and her children. Such work as mending was taught the\r\ndomestic-minded children and tending food on the pots was alloted others\r\nwith inborn ability to cook. They were treated well and taught 'manners'\r\nand later was used as dining room girls and nurses.\r\n\r\nRandall's father and mother were considered lucky. His father was\r\noverseer and his mother was a waitress.\r\n\r\nDoctor Miller was a kind and considerate owner; never believed in\r\npunishing slaves unless in extreme cases. No overseer, white or colored\r\ncould whip his slaves without first bringing the slave before him and\r\nhaving a full understanding as to what the offense was. If it warranted\r\nwhipping them it had to be given in his presence so he could see that it\r\nwas not given unmercifully. He indeed was a doctor and practised his\r\nprofession in the keeping of his slaves from bodily harm as well as\r\nkeeping them well. He gave them medicine when they did not feel well and\r\nsaw to it that they took needed rest if they were sick and tired.\r\n\r\nNow, Robert Lee, Randall's father, was brought from Virginia and sold to\r\nDoctor Miller when he was a young man. The one who sold him told Doctor\r\nMiller, \"Here's a nigger who wont take a whipping. He knows his work and\r\nwill do it and all you will need to do is tell him what you want and its\r\nas good as done.\" Robert Lee never varied from the recommendation his\r\nformer master gave when he sold him.\r\n\r\nThe old tale of corn bread baked on the hearth covered with ashes and\r\nsweet potatoes cooked in like manner are vivid memories upon the mind of\r\nRandall. Syrup water and plenty of sweet and butter milk, rice and\r\ncrackling bread are other foods which were plentiful around the cabin of\r\nRandall's parents.\r\n\r\nCows were numerous and the family of Doctor Miller did not need much for\r\ntheir consumption. While they sold milk to neighboring plantations, the\r\nNegroes were not denied the amount necessary to keep all strong and\r\nhealthy. None of the children on the plantation were thin and scrawny\r\nnor did they ever complain of being hungry.\r\n\r\nThe tanning yard was not far from the house Doctor Miller. His own\r\nbutcher shop was nearby. He had his cows butchered at intervals and when\r\none died of unnatural causes it was skinned and the hide tanned on the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nRandall as a child delighted in stopping around the tanning yard and\r\nwatching the men salt the hide. They, after salting it dug holes and\r\nburied it for a number of days. After the salting process was finished\r\nit was treated with a solution of water and oak bark. When the oak bark\r\nsolution had done its work it was ready for use. Shoes made of leather\r\nwere not dyed at that time but the natural color of the finished hide\r\nwas thought very beautiful and those who were lucky enough to possess a\r\npair were glad to get them in their natural color. To dye shoes various\r\ncolors is a new thing when the number of years leather has been dyed is\r\ncompared with the hundreds of years people knew nothing about it,\r\nespecially American people.\r\n\r\nRandall's paternal grandparents were also owned by Doctor Miller and\r\nwere not sold after he bought them. Levi Lee was his grandfather's name.\r\nHe was a fine worker in the field but was taken out of it to be taught\r\nthe shoe-makers trade. The master placed him under a white shoemaker who\r\ntaught him all the fine points. If there were any, he knew about the\r\ntrade. Dr. Miller had an eye for business who could make shoes was a\r\ngreat saving to him. Levi made all the shoes and boots the master,\r\nmistress and the Miller family wore. Besides, he made shoes for the\r\nslaves who wore them. Not all slaves owned a pair of shoes. Boys and\r\ngirls under eighteen went bare-footed except in winter. Doctor Miller\r\nhad compassion for them and did not allow them to suffer from the cold\r\nby going bare-footed in winter.\r\n\r\nAnother good thing to be remembered was the large number of chickens,\r\nducks and geese which the slaves raised for the doctor. Every slave\r\nfamily could rest his tired body upon a feather bed for it was allowed\r\nhim after the members of the master's family were supplied. Moss\r\nmattresses also were used under the feather beds and slaves did not need\r\nto have as thick a feather bed on that account. They were comfortable\r\nthough and Randall remembers how he and the other children used to fall\r\ndown in the middle of the bed and become hidden from view, so soft was\r\nthe feather mattress. It was especially good to get in bed in winter but\r\nnot so pleasant to get up unless 'pappy' had made the fire early enough\r\nfor the large one-room cabin to get warm. The children called their own\r\nparents 'pappy' and 'mammy' in slavery time.\r\n\r\nRandall remembers how after a foot-washing in the old wooden tub,\r\n(which, by the way, was simply a barrel cut in half and holes cut in the\r\ntwo sides for fingers to catch a hold) he would sit a few minutes with\r\nhis feet held to the fire so they could dry. He also said his 'mammy'\r\nwould rub grease under the soles of his feet to keep him from taking\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the child that he had just gone to bed when the old tallow\r\ncandle was lighted and his 'pappy' arose and fell upon his knees and\r\nprayed aloud for God's blessings and thanked him for another day. The\r\nfield hands were to be in the field by five o'clock and it meant to rise\r\nbefore day, summer and winter. Not so bad in summer for it was soon day\r\nbut in winter the weather was cold and darkness was longer passing away.\r\nWhen daylight came field hands had been working an hour or more. Robert\r\nLee, Randall's father was an overseer and it meant for him to be up and\r\nout with the rest of the men so he could see if things were going\r\nallright.\r\n\r\nThe Randall children were not forced up early because they did not eat\r\nbreakfast with their 'pappy'. Their mother was dining-room girl in her\r\nmistress' house, so fed the children right from the Miller table. There\r\nwas no objection offered to this.\r\n\r\nDoctor Miller was kind but he did not want his slaves enlightened too\r\nmuch. Therefore, he did not allow much preaching in the church. They\r\ncould have prayer meeting all they wanted to, but instructions from the\r\nBible were thought dangerous for the slaves. He did not wish them to\r\nbecome too wise and get it into their heads to ran away and get free.\r\n\r\nThere was talk about freedom and Doctor Miller knew it would be only a\r\nmatter of time when he would loose all his slaves. He said to Randall's\r\nmother one day, \"Delhia you'll soon be as free as I am.\" She said. \"Sho'\r\nnuf massy?\" and he answered. \"You sure will.\" Nothing more was said to\r\nany of the slaves until Sherman's army came through notifying the\r\nslaves they were free.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the soldiers caused such a comotion around the\r\nplantation that Randall's mind was indelibly impressed with their\r\ndoings.\r\n\r\nThe northern soldiers took all the food they could get their hands on\r\nand took possession of the cattle and horses and mules. Levi, the\r\nbrother of Randall, and who was named after his paternal grandfather,\r\nwas put on a mule and the mule loaded with provisions and sent two miles\r\nto the soldier's camp. Levi liked that, for beside being well treated he\r\nreceived several pieces of money. The federal soldiers played with him\r\nand gave him all the food he wanted, although the Miller slaves and\r\ntheir children were fed and there was no reason for the child to be\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\nLevi Lee, the grandfather of young Levi and Randall, had a dream while\r\nthe soldiers were encamped round about the place. He dreamed that a pot\r\nof money was buried in a certain place; the person who showed it to him\r\ntold him to go dig for it on the first rainy night. He kept the dream a\r\nsecret and on the first rainy night he went, dug, and found the pot of\r\nmoney right where his dream had told him it would be. He took the pot of\r\nmoney to his cabin and told no one anything about it. He hid it as\r\nsecurely as possible, but when the soldiers were searching for gold and\r\nsilver money they did not leave the Negro's cabin out of the search.\r\nWhen they found the money they thought Levi's master had given him the\r\nmoney to hide as they took it from him. Levi mourned a long time about\r\nthe loss of his money and often told his grandchildren that he would\r\nhave been well fixed when freedom came if he had not been robbed of his\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\"Paddyroles\" as the men were called who were sent by the Rebels to watch\r\nthe slaves to prevent their escaping during war times, were very active\r\nafter freedom. They intimidated the Negroes and threatened them with\r\nloss of life if they did not stay and work for their former masters.\r\nDoctor Miller did not want any of his slaves treated in such manner. He\r\ntold them they were free and could take whatever name they desired.\r\n\r\nRobert Lee, during slavery was Robert Miller, as were all of the\r\ndoctor's slaves. After slavery was ended he chose the name Lee. His\r\nbrother Aaron took the name Alexander not thinking how it looked for two\r\nbrothers of the same parents to have different surnames. There are sons\r\nof each brother living in Palatka now, one set Lees and the others,\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nRandall, as was formerly stated, spent a very little time in slavery.\r\nMost of his knowledge concerning customs which long ago have been\r\nabandoned and replaced by more modern ones, is of early reconstruction\r\ndays. Just after the Civil War, when his father began farming on his own\r\nplantation, his mother remained home and cared for her house and\r\nchildren. She was of fair complexion, having been the daughter of a\r\nhalf-breed Indian and Negro mother. Her father was white. Her native\r\nstate was Virginia and she bore some of the aristocratic traits so\r\ncommon among those born in that state of such parentage. She often\r\nboasted of her \"blue blood Virginia stock.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Lee, Randall's father was very prosperous in early reconstruction\r\ndays. He owned horses, mules and a plow. The plow was made of point iron\r\nwith a wooden handle, not like plows of today for they are of cast iron\r\nand steel.\r\n\r\nChickens, ducks and geese were raised in abundance and money began\r\naccumulating rapidly for Robert and Delhia Lee. They began improving\r\ntheir property and trying to give their children some education. It was\r\nvery hard for those living in small towns and out in the country to go\r\nto school even though they had money to pay for their education. The\r\nnorth sent teachers down but not every hamlet was favored with such. (1)\r\n\r\nRandall was taught to farm and he learned well. He saved his money as he\r\nworked and grew to manhood. Years after freedom he left South Carolina\r\nand went to Palatka, Florida, where he is today. He bought some land\r\nand although most of it is hammock land and not much good he has at\r\nintervals been offered good prices for it. Some white people during the\r\n\"boom\" of 1925-26 offered him a few dollars an acre for it but he\r\nrefused to sell thinking a better price would be offered if he held on.\r\n(2)\r\n\r\nToday finds Randall Lee, an old man with fairly good health; he stated\r\nthat he had not had a doctor for years and his thinking faculties are in\r\ngood order. His eyesight is failing but he does not allow that to\r\nhandicap him in getting about. He talks fluently about what he remembers\r\nconcerning slavery and that which his parents told him. He is between a\r\nmulatto and brown skin with good, mixed gray and black hair. His\r\nfeatures are regular, not showing much Negro blood. He is tall and looks\r\nto weigh about one hundred and sixty-five pounds. His wife lives with\r\nhim in their two-story frame house which shows that they have had better\r\ndays financially. The man and wife both show interest in the progress of\r\nthe Negro race and possess some books about the history of the Negro.\r\nOne book of particular interest, and of which the wife of Randall Lee\r\nthinks a great deal, was written, according to her story, by John Brown.\r\nIt is called \"The History of the Colored Race in America.\" She could not\r\nfind but a few pages of it when interviewed but declared she had owned\r\nthe entire book for years. The pages she had and showed with such pride\r\nwere 415 to 449 inclusive. The book was written in the year 1836 and the\r\nfew pages produced by her gave information concerning the Negro, Lovejoy\r\nof St. Louis, Missouri. It is the same man for whom the city of Lovejoy,\r\nIllinois is named. The other book she holds with pride and guards\r\njealously is \"The College of Life\" by Henry Davenport Northrop D.D.,\r\nHonorable Joseph R. Gay and Professor I. Garland Penn. It was entered,\r\naccording to the Act of Congress in the year 1900 by Horace C. Fry, in\r\nthe office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington, D.C. (3)\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1.

They listened\r\nround-eyed to stories they already knew because \"pap\" had told them so\r\nmany times before. These narratives along with the great changes he has\r\nseen, were carefully recorded in the mind of Edward, the only one of\r\nthis group now alive.\r\n\r\n\"Pap\" was always ready to oblige with the story they never tired of. He\r\ncould always be depended upon to begin at the beginning, for he loved to\r\ntell it.\r\n\r\n\"It all begun with our ship being took off the coast of Newport News,\r\nVirginia. We wuz runnin' the blockade--sellin' guns and what-not to them\r\nNortherners. We aint had nothin' to do wid de war, unnerstand, we\r\nEnglish folks was at'ter de money. Whose War? The North and South's, of\r\ncourse. I hear my captain say many a time as how they was playin' ball\r\nwid the poor niggers. One side says 'You can't keep your niggers lessen\r\nyou pay em and treat em like other folks.' Mind you dat wasn't de rale\r\nreason, they was mad at de South but it was one of de ways dey could be\r\nhurted--to free de niggers.\"\r\n\r\n\"De South says 'Dese is our niggers and we'll do dum as we please,' and\r\nso de rumpus got wuss dan it was afore. The North had all do money, and\r\ncalled itself de Gov'ment. The South aint had nothin', but a termination\r\nnot to be out-did, so we dealt wid de North. De South was called de\r\nRebels.\"\r\n\r\n\"So when dey see a ship off they coast, they hailed it and when we kep\r\ngoin', they fired at us. 'Twan't long afore we was being unloaded and\r\nmarched off to the lousiest jail I ever been in. My captain kep tellin'\r\nem we was English subjects and could not be helt. Me, I was a scairt\r\nman, cause I was always free, and over here dey took it for granted dat\r\nall black men should be slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"The jailer felt of my muscles one day, when he had marched me out at\r\nthe point of his musket to fill de watering troughs for de horses. He\r\nwanted to know who I blong ter, and offered to buy me. When nobody\r\nclaimed me, they was forced to let me go long wid de other Britishers\r\nand as our ship had been destroyed, we had to git back home best we\r\ncould. Dey didn't dare hold us no longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"As de war was still being fit, we was forced to separate, cause a lot\r\nof us would cause spicion, traipsing 'bout do country. Me--I took off\r\nsouthward and way from de war belt, traveling as far as Saint Augustine.\r\nIt was a dangerous journey, as anybody was liable to pick me off for a\r\nrunaway slave. I was forced to hide in de day time if I was near a\r\nsettlement and travel at night. I met many runaway slaves. Some was\r\ntrying to get North and fight for de freeing of they people; others was\r\njes runnin' way cause dey could. Many of dem didn't had no idea where\r\ndey was goin' and told of havin' good marsters. But one and all dey had\r\na good strong notion ter see what it was like to own your own body.\"\r\n\r\n\"I felt worlds better when I reached Saint Augustine. Many ships landed\r\nthere and I knowed I could get my way back at least to de West Indies,\r\nwhere I come frum. I showed my papers to everybody dat mounted ter\r\nanything and dey knowed I was a free nigger. I had plenty of money on me\r\nand I made a big ter do mong de other free men I met. One day I went to\r\nthe slave market and watched em barter off po niggers lake dey was hogs.\r\nWhole families sold together and some was split--mother gone to one\r\nmarster and father and children gone to others.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'd bring a slave out on the flatform and open his mouth, pound his\r\nchest, make him harden his muscles so the buyer could see what he was\r\ngittin'. Young men was called 'bucks' and young women 'wenches'. The\r\nperson that offered the best price was de buyer. And dey shore did git\r\nrid uf some pretty gals. Dey always looked so shame and pitiful up on\r\ndat stand wid all dem men standin' dere lookin' at em wid what dey had\r\non dey minds shinin' in they eyes One little gal walked up and left her\r\nmammy mourning so pitiful cause she had to be sold. Seems like dey all\r\nbelong in a family where nobody ever was sold. My she was a pretty gal.\"\r\n\r\n\"And dats why your mamma's named Julia stead of Mary Jane or Hannah or\r\nsomethin' else--She cost me $950.00 and den my own freedom. But she was\r\nworth it--every bit of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"After that I put off my trip back home and made her home my home for\r\nthree years. Den with our two young children we left Floridy and went to\r\nthe West Indies to live. We traveled bout a bit gettin as far as\r\nEngland. We got letters from your ma's folks and dey jes had to see her\r\nor else somebody would'er died, so we sailed back into de war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Freedom was declared soon after we got back to dis country and de whole\r\ncountry was turned upside down. De po niggers went mad. Some refused to\r\nwork and dey didn't stay in one place long 'nough to do a thing. De\r\ncrops suffered and soon we had starvation times for 'bout two years.\r\nAfter dat everybody lernt to think of a rainy day and things got\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nEdward recalls of hearing his father tell of eating wild hog salad and\r\ncabbage palms. It was a common occurence to see whole families\r\nsubsisting on any wild plant not known to be poisonous if it contained\r\nthe least food value. The freedmen helped those who were newly liberated\r\nto gain a footing. Prior to Emancipation they had not been allowed to\r\nassociate with slaves for fear they might engender in them the desire to\r\nbe free. The freedmen bore the brunt of the white man's suspicion\r\nwhenever there was a slave uprising. They were always accusing them of\r\nbeing instigators. Edward often heard his mother tell of the\r\n\"patter-rollers\", a group of white men who caught and administered\r\nsevere whippings to these unfortunate slaves. They also corraled slaves\r\nback to their masters if they were caught out after nine o'clock at\r\nnight without a pass from their masters.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lycurgas was born at Liverpool, England and became a seaman at an\r\nearly age. Edward thinks he might have had a fair education if he had\r\nhad the chance. The mother, Julia Gray, Lycurgas, was the daughter of\r\nBarbara and David Gray, slaves of the Flemings of Clay County, Florida.\r\n\r\nThese slaves were inherited from generation to generation and no one\r\never thought to sell one except for punishment or in dire necessity.\r\nThey were treated kindly and like most slaves of the wealthy, had no\r\nknowledge of the real cruelties of slavery, but upon the death of their\r\nowner it became necessary to parcel the slaves out to different heirs,\r\nsome of whom did not believe in holding these unfortunates. These\r\nwould-be abolitionists were not averse to placing at auction their share\r\nof the slaves, however.\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that George Lycurgas saw and bought the girl who\r\nwas to become his wife. Both are now dead, also all of the several\r\nchildren except Edward who tells their story here.\r\n\r\nEdward Lycurgas was born on October 28, 1872, at Saint Augustine,\r\nFlorida shortly after the return of the family from the West Indies. He\r\nlived on his father's farm sharing at an early age the hard work that\r\nseemed always in abundance, and listening in awe to the stories of the\r\nrecent war. He heard his elders give thanks for their freedom when they\r\nattended church and wondered what it was all about.\r\n\r\nNo one failed to attend church on Sundays and all work ceased in a\r\nvicinity where a camp meeting was held. Farmers flocked to the meeting\r\nfrom all parts of Saint Johns County. They brought food in their large\r\nbaskets. Some owned buggies but most of them hauled their families in\r\nwagons or walked. The camp meetings would sometimes last for several\r\ndays according to the spiritual fervor exhibited by those attending.\r\n\r\nLycurgas recalls the stirring sermons and spirituals that rang through\r\nthe woods and could be heard for several miles on a clear day. And the\r\nriver baptisms! These climaxed the meetings and were attended by large\r\ncrowds of whites in the neighborhood. All candidates were dressed in\r\nwhite gowns, stockings and towels would about their heads bandana\r\nfashion. Tow by two they marched to the river from the spot where they\r\nhad dressed. There was always some stiring song to accompany their slow\r\nmarch to the river. \"Take me to the water to be baptized\" was the\r\nfavorite spiritual for this occasion.\r\n\r\nAs in all things, some attended camp meetings for the opportunity it\r\nafforded them to indulge in illicit love making. Others went to show\r\ntheir finery and there was plenty of it according to Lycurgas'\r\nstatement. There seemed to be beautiful clothing, fine teams and buggies\r\neverywhere--a sort of reaction from the restraint upon them in slavery.\r\nMany wore clothing they could not afford.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a deeper interest in politics during these times.\r\nMass meetings, engineered by \"carpet baggers\" were often held and\r\nlargely attended, although the father of Edward did not hold with these\r\nactivities very much. He often heard the preacher point out Negroes who\r\nattended the meetings and attained prominence in politics as an example\r\nfor members of his flock to follow. He believes he recalls hearing the\r\nname of Joseph Gibbs.\r\n\r\nNext to the preacher, the Negro school teacher was held in greatest\r\nrespect. Until the year of the \"shake\" (earthquake of 1886) there were\r\nno Negro school teachers on Saint John's County and no school buildings.\r\nThey attended classes at the fort and were taught by a white woman who\r\nhad come from \"up nawth\" for this purpose. Edward was able to learn very\r\nlittle from his blue back Webster because his help was needed on the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nHe was a lover of home, very shy and did not care much for courting. He\r\nremained with his parents until their deaths and did not leave the\r\nvicinity for many years. He is still unmarried and resides at the Clara\r\nWhite Mission, Jacksonville, Florida, where he receives a email salary\r\nfor the piddling jobs about the place that he is able to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1.

Her eyes were closed, her hands incredibly old and\r\nworkworn were slowly folding and unfolding on her lap.\r\n\r\nShe listened quietly to the interviewer's request for some of the \"high\r\nlights\" of her life and finally exclaimed: \"Chile, why'ny you look among\r\nthe living fer the high lights?\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing resentful in this expression; only the patient\r\nweariness of one who has been dragged through the boundaries of a\r\nyesterday from which he was inseparable and catapulted into a present\r\nwith which he has nothing in common. After being assured that her life\r\nstory was of real interest to some one she warmed up and talked quite\r\nfreely of the life and times as they existed in her day.\r\n\r\nHow old was she? She confessed quite frankly that she never \"knowed\" her\r\nage. She was a grownup during the Civil War when she was commandered by\r\nUnion soldiers invading the country and employed as a cook. Her owner,\r\none Redding Pamell, possessed a hundred or more slaves and was,\r\naccording to her statement very kind to them. It was on his plantation\r\nthat she was born. Amanda McCray is one of several children born to\r\nJacob and Mary Williams, the latter being blind since Amanda could\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nChildren on the Pamell plantation led a carefree existence until they\r\nwere about 12 years of age, when they were put to light chores like\r\ncarrying water and food, picking seed from cotton lint (there were no\r\ncotton gins), and minding the smaller children. They were duly schooled\r\nin all the current superstitions and listened to the tales of ghosts and\r\nanimals that talked and reasoned, tales common to the Negro today.\r\nLittle Mandy believes to this day that hogs can see the wind and that\r\nall animals talk like men on Christmas morning at a certain time.\r\nChildren wore moles feet and pearl buttons around their necks to insure\r\neasy teething and had their legs bathed in a concoction of wasp nest and\r\nvinegar if they were slow about learning to walk. This was supposed to\r\nstrengthen the weak limbs. It was a common occurence to see a child of\r\ntwo or three years still nursing at the mother's breast. Their masters\r\nencouraged the slaves to do this, thinking it made strong bones and\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas time the slave children all trouped to \"de big house\" and\r\nstood outside crying \"Christmas gift\" to their master and mistress. They\r\nwere never disappointed. Gifts consisted mostly of candies, nuts and\r\nfruits but there was always some useful article of clothing included,\r\nsomething they were not accustomed to having. Once little Mandy received\r\na beautiful silk dress from her young mistress, who knew how much she\r\nliked beautiful clothes. She was a very happy child and loved the dress\r\nso much that she never wore it except on some special occasion.\r\n\r\nAmanda was trained to be a house servant, learning to cook and knit from\r\nthe blind mother who refused to let this handicap affect her usefulness.\r\nShe liked best to sew the fine muslins and silks of her mistress, making\r\nbeautiful hooped dresses that required eight and ten yards of cloth and\r\nsometimes as many as seven petticoats to enhance their fullness.\r\n\r\nHoops for these dresses were made of grape-vines that were shaped while\r\ngreen and cured in the sun before using. Beautiful imported laces were\r\nused to trim the petticoats and pantaloons of the wealthy.\r\n\r\nThe Pamell slaves had a Negro minister who could hold services any time\r\nhe chose, so long as he did not interfere with the work of the other\r\nslaves. He was not obliged to do hard menial labors and went about the\r\nplantation \"all dressed up\" in a frock coat and store-bought shoes. He\r\nwas more than a little conscious of this and was held in awe by the\r\nothers. He often visited neighboring plantations to hold his services.\r\nIt was from this minister that they first heard of the Civil War. He\r\nheld whispered prayers for the success of the Union soldiers, not\r\nbecause freedom was so desirable to them, but for other slaves who were\r\ntreated so cruelly. There was a praying ground where \"the grass never\r\nhad a chancet ter grow fer the troubled knees that kept it crushed\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\nAmanda was an exceptionally good cook and so widespread was this\r\nknowledge that the Union soldiers employed her as a cook in their camp\r\nfor a short while. She does not remember any of their officers and\r\nthinks they were no better nor worse than the others. These soldiers\r\ncommitted no depredations in her section except to confiscate whatever\r\nthey wanted in the way of food and clothing. Some married southern\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nMr. Pamell made land grants to all slaves who wanted to remain with him;\r\nfew left, so kind had he been to them all.\r\n\r\nLife went on in much the same manner for Amanda's family except that the\r\nchildren attended school where a white teacher instructed them from a\r\n\"blue back Webster.\" Amanda was a young woman but she managed to learn\r\nto read a little. Later they had colored teachers who followed much the\r\nsame routine as the whites had. They were held in awe by the other\r\nNegroes and every little girl yearned to be a teacher, as this was about\r\nthe only professional field open to Negro women at that time.\r\n\r\n\"After de war Negroes blossomed out with fine phaetons (buggies) and\r\nceiled houses, and clothes--oh my!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. McCray did not keep up with the politics of her time but remembers\r\nhearing about Joe Gibbs, member of the Florida Legislature. There was\r\nmuch talk then of Booker T. Washington, and many thought him a fool for\r\ntrying to start a school in Alabama for Negroes. She recalls the Negro\r\npost master who served two or three terms at Madison. She could not give\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nThere have been three widespread \"panics\" (depressions) during her\r\nlifetime but Mrs. McCray thinks this is the worst one. During the Civil\r\nWar, coffee was so dear that meal was parched and used as a substitute\r\nbut now, she remarked, \"you can't hardly git the meal for the bread.\"\r\n\r\nHer husband and children are all dead and she lives with a niece who is\r\nno longer young herself. Circumstances are poor here. The niece earns\r\nher living as laundress and domestic worker, receiving a very poor wage.\r\nMrs. McCray is now quite infirm and almost blind. She seems happiest\r\ntalking of the past that was a bit kinder to her.\r\n\r\nAt present she lives on the northeast corner of First and Macon Streets.\r\nThe postoffice address is #11, Madison, Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1.

Simms, Editor\r\nTitusville, Florida\r\nSeptember 25, 1936\r\n\r\nHENRY MAXWELL\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Up from Slavery\" might well be called this short biographical sketch of\r\nHenry Maxwell, who first saw the light of day on October 17, 1859 in\r\nLownes County, Georgia. His mother Ann, was born in Virginia, and his\r\nfather, Robert, was born in South Carolina. Captain Peters, Ann's owner,\r\nbought Robert Maxwell from Charles Howell as a husband for Ann. To this\r\nunion were born seven children, two girls--Elizabeth and Rosetta--and\r\nfive boys--Richard, Henry, Simms, Solomon and Sonnie. After the death of\r\nCaptain Peters in 1863, Elizabeth and Richard were sold to the Gaines\r\nfamily. Rosetta and Robert (the father) were purchased from the Peters'\r\nestate by Isham Peters, Captain Peters' son, and Henry and Simms were\r\nbought by James Bamburg, husband of Izzy Peters, daughter of Captain\r\nPeters. (Solomon and Sonnie were born after slavery.)\r\n\r\nJust a tot when the Civil War gave him and his people freedom, Maxwell's\r\nmemories of bondage-days are vivid through the experiences related by\r\nolder Negroes. He relates the story of the plantation owner who trained\r\nhis dogs to hunt escaped slaves. He had a Negro youth hide in a tree\r\nsome distance away, and then he turned the pack loose to follow him. One\r\nday he released the bloodhounds too soon, and they soon overtook the boy\r\nand tore him to pieces. When the youth's mother heard of the atrocity,\r\nshe burst into tears which were only silenced by the threats of her\r\nowner to set the dogs on her. Maxwell also relates tales of the terrible\r\nbeatings that the slaves received for being caught with a book or for\r\ntrying to run away.\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War the Maxwell family was united for a short while, and\r\nlater they drifted apart to go their various ways. Henry and his parents\r\nresided for a while longer in Lownes County, and in 1880 they came to\r\nTitusville, with the two younger children, Solomon and Sonnie. Here\r\nHenry secured work with a farmer for whom he worked for $12 a month. In\r\n1894 he purchased a small orange grove and began to cultivate oranges.\r\nToday he owns over 30 acres of orange groves and controls nearly 200\r\nmore acres. He is said to be worth around $250,000 and is Titusville's\r\nmost influential and respected colored citizen. He is married but has no\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n[TR: Interview of Titus Bynes, including sections about Della Bess\r\nHilyard (\"Aunt Bess\") and Taylor Gilbert repeated here.

Several of these plantations, she says, were\r\nvery large, and some of them had as many as 100 slaves.\r\n\r\nThe ex-slave, who is now 84 years old, recalls that at least three of\r\nthe plantations in the vicinity were owned or operated by Minorcans. She\r\nsays that the Minorcans were popularly referred to in the section as\r\n\"Turnbull's Darkies,\" a name they apparently resented. This caused many\r\nof them, she claims, to drop or change their names to Spanish or\r\nAmerican surnames.\r\n\r\nChristine moved to Fernandina a few years after her freedom, and there\r\nlived near the southern tip of Amelia Island, where Negro ex-slaves\r\nlived in a small settlement all their own. This settlement still exists,\r\nalthough many of its former residents are either dead or have moved\r\naway.\r\n\r\nChristine describes the little Amelia Island community as practically\r\nself-sustaining, its residents raising their own food, meats, and other\r\ncommodities. Fishing was a favorite vocation with them, and some of then\r\nestablished themselves as small merchants of sea foods.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the families of Amelia Island, according to the ex-slave,\r\nwere large ones, and her own relatives, the Drummonds, were among the\r\nlargest of these.\r\n\r\nChristine Mitchell regards herself as one of the oldest remaining\r\nex-slaves in the Saint Augustine section, and is very well known in the\r\nneighborhood of her home at St. Francis and Oneida Streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1. Interview with subject, Christine Drummond Mitchell, Oneida street\r\ncorner Saint Francis, Saint Augustine, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Unit)\r\n\r\nMartin Richardson, Field Worker\r\nPalatka, Florida\r\nJanuary 13, 1937\r\n\r\nLINDSEY MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EX-SLAVE WHO WAS RESOURCEFUL\r\n\r\nIn a little blacksmith shop at 1114 Madison Street, Palatka, is a busy\r\nlittle horse-shoer who was born in slavery eighty-seven years ago.\r\n_Lindsey Moore_, blacksmith, leather-tanner ex-marble shooting champion\r\nand a number of other things, represents one of the most resourceful\r\nformer slaves yet found in the state.\r\n\r\nMoore was born in 1850 on the plantation of John B. Overtree, in\r\nForsythe County, Georgia. He was one of the six children of Eliza Moore;\r\nall of them remained the property of Overtree until freed.\r\n\r\nOn the Overtree plantation the slave children were allowed considerable\r\ntime for play until their tenth or twelfth years; Lindsey took full\r\nadvantage of this opportunity and became very skillful at\r\nmarble-shooting. It was here that he first learned to utilize his\r\ntalents profitably. 'Massa Overtree' discovered the ability of Lindsey\r\nand another urchin to shoot marbles, and began taking them into town to\r\ncompete with the little slaves of other owners. There would be betting\r\non the winners.\r\n\r\nMr. Overtree won some money in this manner, Lindsey and his companion\r\nbeing consistent winners. But Lindsey saw possibilities other than the\r\nglory of his victories in this new game; with pennies that some of the\r\nspectators tossed him he began making small wagers of his own with his\r\ncompetitors, and soon had amassed quite a small pile of silver for those\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAlthough shoes were unheard-of in Lindsey's youth, he used to watch\r\ncarefully whenever a cow was skinned and its hide tanned to make shoes\r\nfor the women and the 'folks in the big house'. Through his attention to\r\nthe tanning operations he learned everything about tanning except one\r\nsolution that he could not discover. It was not until years later that\r\nhe learned that the jealously-guarded ingredient was plain salt and\r\nwater. By the time he had learned it, however, he had so mastered the\r\ntanning operations that he at once added it to his sources of\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\nLindsey escaped much of the farm work on the Overtree place by learning\r\nto skillfully assist the women who made cloth out of the cotton from the\r\nfields. He grew very fast at cleaning 'rods', clearing the looms and\r\nother operations; when, at thirteen, it became time for him to pick\r\ncotton he had become so fast at helping with spinning and weighing the\r\ncotton that others had picked that he almost entirely escaped the\r\npicking himself.\r\n\r\nSoap-making was another of the plantation arts that Lindsey mastered\r\nearly. His ability to save every possible ounce of grease from the meats\r\nhe cooked added many choice bits of pork to his otherwise meatless fare;\r\nhe was able to spend many hours in the shade pouring water over oak\r\nashes that other young slaves were passing picking cotton or hoeing\r\npotatoes in the burning sun.\r\n\r\nLindsey's first knowledge of the approach of freedom came when he heard\r\na loud brass band coming down the road toward the plantation playing a\r\nstrange, lively tune while a number of soldiers in blue uniforms marched\r\nbehind. He ran to the front gate and was ordered to take charge of the\r\nhorse of one of the officers in such an abrupt tone until he 'begin to\r\nshaking in my bare feet! There followed much talk between the officers\r\nand Lindsey's mistress, with the soldiers finally going into encampment\r\na short distance away from the plantation.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers took command of the spring that was used for a water supply\r\nfor the plantation, giving Lindsey another opportunity to make money. He\r\nwould be sent from the plantation to the spring for water, and on the\r\nway back would pass through the camp of the soldiers. These would be\r\nhappy to pay a few pennies for a cup of water rather than take the long\r\nhike to the Spring themselves; Lindsey would empty bucket after bucket\r\nbefore finally returning to the plantation. Out of his profits he bought\r\nhis first pair of shoes--though nearly a grown man.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers finally departed, with all but five of the Overtree slaves\r\njoyously trooping behind them. Before leaving, however, they tore up the\r\nrailroad and its station, burning the ties and heating the rails until\r\nred then twisting them around tree-trunks. Wheat fields were trampled by\r\ntheir horses, and devastation left on all sides.\r\n\r\nLindsey and his mother were among those who stayed at the plantation.\r\nWhen freedom became general his father began farming on a tract that was\r\nlater turned over to Lindsey. Lindsey operated the farm for a while, but\r\nlater desired to learn horseshoeing, and apprenticed himself to a\r\nblacksmith. At the end of three years he had become so proficient that\r\nhis former master rewarded him with a five-dollar bonus for shoeing one\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nPossessing now the trades of blacksmithing, tanning and\r\nweaving-and-spinning, Lindsey was tempted to follow some of his former\r\nassociates to the North, but was discouraged from doing so by a few who\r\nreturned, complaining bitterly about the unaccustomed cold and the\r\ndifficulty of making a living. He moved South instead and settled in the\r\narea around Palatka.\r\n\r\nHe is still in the section, being recognized as an excellent blacksmith\r\ndespite his more than four-score years.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nInterview with subject, Lindsey Moore, 1114 Madison Street, Palatka,\r\nFla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nJ.M. Johnson, Field Worker\r\nJohn A. Simms, Editor\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nSeptember 18, 1936\r\n\r\nMACK MULLEN\r\n\r\n\r\nMack Mullen, a former slave who now lives at 521 W. First Street,\r\nJacksonville, Florida, was born in Americus, Georgia in 1857, eight\r\nyears before Emancipation, on a plantation which covered an area of\r\napproximately five miles. Upon this expansive plantation about 200\r\nslaves lived and labored. At its main entrance stood a large white\r\ncolonial mansion.\r\n\r\nIn this abode lived Dick Snellings, the master, and his family. The\r\nSnellings plantation produced cotton, corn, oats, wheat, peanuts,\r\npotatoes, cane and other commodities. The live stock consisted primarily\r\nof hogs and cattle. There was on the plantation what was known as a\r\n\"crib,\" where oats, corn and wheat were stored, and a \"smoke house\" for\r\npork and beef. The slaves received their rations weekly, it was\r\napportioned according to the number in the family.\r\n\r\nMack Mullen's mother was named Ellen and his father Sam. Ellen was\r\n\"house woman\" and Sam did the blacksmithing, Ellen personally attended\r\nMrs. Snellings, the master's wife. Mack being quite young did not have\r\nany particular duties assigned to him, but stayed around the Snellings\r\nmansion and played. Sometimes \"marster\" Snellings would take him on his\r\nknee and talk to him. Mack remembers that he often told him that some\r\nday he was going to be a noble man. He said that he was going to make\r\nhim the head overseer. He would often give him candy and money and take\r\nhim in his buggy for a ride.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlantation Life: The slaves lived in cabins called quarters, which were\r\nconstructed of lumber and logs. A white man was their overseer, he\r\nassigned the slaves their respective tasks. There was also a slave known\r\nas a \"caller.\" He came around to the slave cabins every morning at four\r\no'clock and blew a \"cow-horn\" which was the signal for the slaves to get\r\nup and prepare themselves for work in the fields.\r\n\r\nAll of them on hearing this horn would arise and prepare their meal; by\r\nsix o'clock they were on their way to the fields. They would work all\r\nday, stopping only for a brief period at midday to eat. Mack Mullen\r\nsays that some of the most beautiful spirituals were sung while they\r\nlabored.\r\n\r\nThe women wore towels wrapped around their heads for protection from the\r\nsun, and most of them smoked pipes. The overseer often took Mack with\r\nhim astride his horse as he made his \"rounds\" to inspect the work being\r\ndone. About sundown, the \"cow-horn\" of the caller was blown and all\r\nhands stopped work, and made their way back to their cabins. One behind\r\nthe other they marched singing \"I'm gonna wait 'til Jesus Comes.\" After\r\narriving at their cabins they would prepare their meals; after eating\r\nthey would sometimes gather in front of a cabin and dance to the tunes\r\nplayed on the fiddle and the drum. The popular dance at that time was\r\nknown as the \"figure dance.\" At nine p.m. the overseer would come\r\naround; everything was supposed to be quiet at that hour. Some of the\r\nslaves would \"turn in\" for the night while others would remain up as\r\nlong as they wished or as long as they were quiet.\r\n\r\nThe slaves were sometimes given special holidays and on those days they\r\nwould give \"quilting\" parties (quilt making) and dances. These parties\r\nwere sometimes held on their own plantation and sometimes on a\r\nneighboring one. Slaves who ordinarily wanted to visit another\r\nplantation had to get a permit from the master. If they were caught\r\ngoing off the plantation without a permit, they were severely whipped by\r\nthe \"patrolmen\" (white men especially assigned to patrol duty around the\r\nplantation to prevent promiscuous wandering from plantations and\r\n\"runaways.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nWhipping: There was a white man assigned only to whip the slaves when\r\nthey were insubordinate; however, they were not allowed to whip them\r\ntoo severely as \"Marster\" Snellings would not permit it. He would say \"a\r\nslave is of no use to me beaten to death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMarriage: When one slave fell in love with another and wanted to marry\r\nthey were given a license and the matrimony was \"sealed.\" There was no\r\nmarriage ceremony performed. A license was all that was necessary to be\r\nconsidered married. In the event that the lovers lived on separate\r\nplantations the master of one of them would buy the other lover or\r\nwedded one so that they would be together. When this could not be\r\narranged they would have to visit one another, but live on their\r\nrespective plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\nReligion: The slaves had a regular church house, which was a small size\r\nbuilding constructed of boards. Preaching was conducted by a colored\r\nminister especially assigned to this duty. On Tuesday evenings prayer\r\nmeeting was held; on Thursday evenings, preaching; and on Sundays both\r\nmorning and evening preaching. At these services the slaves would \"get\r\nhappy\" and shout excitedly. Those desiring to accept Christ were\r\nadmitted for baptism.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaptism: On baptismal day, the candidates attired in white robes which\r\nthey had made, marched down to the river where they were immersed by the\r\nminister. Slaves from neighboring plantations would come to witness\r\nthis sacred ceremony. Mack Mullen recalls that many times his \"marster\"\r\non going to view a baptism took him along in his buggy. It was a happy\r\nscene, he relates. The slaves would be there in great numbers scattered\r\nabout over the banks of the river. Much shouting and singing went on.\r\nSome of the \"sisters\" and \"brothers\" would get so \"happy\" that they\r\nwould lose control of themselves and \"fall out.\" It was then said that\r\nthe Holy Ghost had \"struck 'em.\" The other slaves would view this\r\nphenomena with awe and reverence, and wait for them to \"come out of it.\"\r\n\"Those were happy days and that was real religion,\" Mack Mullen said.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation: The slaves were not given any formal education, however,\r\nMullen's master was not as rigid as some of the slave-holders in\r\nprohibiting the slaves from learning to read and write. Mrs. Snellings,\r\nthe mistress, taught Mack's mother to read and write a little, and Mr.\r\nSnellings also taught Mack's father how to read, write and figure.\r\nHaving learned a little they would in turn impart their knowledge to\r\ntheir fellow slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreedom: Mullen vividly recalls the day that they heard of their\r\nemancipation; loud reports from guns were heard echoing through the\r\nwoods and plantations; after awhile \"Yankee\" soldiers came and informed\r\nthem that they were free. Mr. Snellings showed no resistance and he was\r\nnot harmed. The slaves on hearing this good news of freedom burst out in\r\nsong and praises to God: it was a gala day. No work was done for a week;\r\nthe time was spent in celebrating. The master told his slaves that they\r\nwere free and could go wherever they wanted to, or they could remain\r\nwith him if they wished. Most of his 200 slaves refused to leave him\r\nbecause he was considered a good master.\r\n\r\nThey were thereafter given individual farms, mules and farm implements\r\nwith which to cultivate the land; their former master got a share out of\r\nwhat was raised. There was no more whipping, no more forced labor and\r\nhours were less drastic.\r\n\r\nMack Mullen's parents were among those slaves who remained; they lived\r\nthere until Mr. Snellings died, and then moved to Isonvillen, near\r\nAmericus, Georgia, where his father opened a black-smith shop, and made\r\nenough money to buy some property. Another child was added to the\r\nfamily, a girl named Mariah. By this time Mack had become a young man\r\nwith a strong desire to travel, so he bade his parents farewell and\r\nheaded for Tampa, Florida. After living there awhile he came to\r\nJacksonville, Florida. At the time of his arrival in Jacksonville, Bay\r\nStreet was paved with blocks and there were no hard surfaced streets in\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the construction, foremen of the Windsor Hotel. Mack\r\nMullen is tall, grey haired, sharp featured and of Caucasian strain (his\r\nmother was a mulatto) with a keen mind and an appearance that belies his\r\n75 years. He laments that he was freed because his master was good to\r\nhis slaves; he says \"we had everything we wanted; never did I think I'd\r\ncome to this--got to get relief.\" (1)\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1. From an interview with Mack Mullen, a former slave at his residence,\r\n521 West First Street, Jacksonville, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nJ.M. Johnson, Field Worker\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nNovember 17, 1936\r\n\r\nLOUIS NAPOLEON\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout three miles from South Jacksonville proper down the old Saint\r\nAugustine Road lives one Louis Napoleon an ex-slave, born in\r\nTallahassee, Florida about 1857, eight years prior to Emancipation.\r\n\r\nHis parents were Scipio and Edith Napoleon, being originally owned by\r\nColonel John S. Sammis of Arlington, Florida and the Floyd family of\r\nSaint Marys, Georgia, respectively.\r\n\r\nScipio and Edith were sold to Arthur Randolph, a physician and large\r\nplantation owner of Fort Louis, about five miles from the capital at\r\nTallahassee. On this large plantation that covered and area of about\r\neight miles and composed approximately of 90 slaves is where Louis\r\nNapoleon first saw the light of day.\r\n\r\nLouis' father was known as the wagoner. His duties were to haul the\r\ncommodities raised on the plantation and other things that required a\r\nwagon. His mother Edith, was known as a \"breeder\" and was kept in the\r\npalatial Randolph mansion to loom cloth for the Randolph family and\r\nslaves. The cloth was made from the cotton raised on the plantation's\r\nfertile fields. As Louis was so young, he had no particular duties, only\r\nto look for hen nests, gather eggs and play with the master's three\r\nyoung boys. There were seven children in the Randolph family, three\r\nyoung boys, two \"missy\" girls and two grown sons. Louis would go fishing\r\nand hunting with the three younger boys and otherwise engage with them\r\nin their childish pranks.\r\n\r\nHe says that his master and mistress were very kind to the slaves and\r\nwould never whip them, nor would he allow the \"driver\" who was a white\r\nman named Barton to do so. Barton lived in a home especially built for\r\nhim on the plantation. If the \"driver\" whipped any of them, all that was\r\nnecessary for the slave who had been whipped was to report it to the\r\nmaster and the \"driver\" was dismissed, as he was a salaried man.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlantation Life. The slaves lived in log cabins especially built for\r\nthem. They were ceiled and arranged in such a manner as to retain the\r\nheat in winter from the large fireplaces constructed therein.\r\n\r\nJust before the dawn of day, the slaves were aroused from their slumber\r\nby a loud blast from a cow-horn that was blown by the \"driver\" as a\r\nsignal to prepare themselves for the fields. The plantation being so\r\nexpansive, those who had to go a long distance to the area where they\r\nworked, were taken in wagons, those working nearby walked. They took\r\ntheir meals along with them and had their breakfast and dinner on the\r\nfields. An hour was allowed for this purpose. The slaves worked while\r\nthey sang spirituals to break the monotony of long hours of work. At the\r\nsetting of the sun, with their day's work all done, they returned to\r\ntheir cabins and prepared their evening's meal. Having finished this,\r\nthe religious among them would gather at one of the cabin doors and give\r\nthanks to God in the form of long supplications and old fashioned songs.\r\nMany of them being highly emotional would respond in shouts of\r\nhallelujahs sometimes causing the entire group to become \"happy\"\r\nconcluding in shouting and praise to God. The wicked slaves expended\r\ntheir pent up emotions in song and dance. Gathering at one of the cabin\r\ndoors they would sing and dance to the tunes of a fife, banjo or fiddle\r\nthat was played by one of their number. Finished with this diversion\r\nthey would retire to await the dawn of a new day which indicated more\r\nwork. The various plantations had white men employed as \"patrols\" whose\r\nduties were to see that the slaves remained on their own plantations,\r\nand if they were caught going off without a permit from the master, they\r\nwere whipped with a \"raw hide\" by the \"driver.\" There was an exception\r\nto this rule, however, on Sundays the religious slaves were allowed to\r\nvisit other plantations where religious services were being held without\r\nhaving to go through the matter of having a permit.\r\n\r\n\r\nReligion. There was a free colored man who was called \"Father James\r\nPage,\" owned by a family of Parkers of Tallahassee. He was freed by them\r\nto go and preach to his own people. He could read and write and would\r\nvisit all the plantations in Tallahassee, preaching the gospel. Each\r\nplantation would get a visit from him one Sunday of each month. The\r\nslaves on the Randolph plantation would congregate in one of the cabins\r\nto receive him where he would read the Bible and preach and sing. Many\r\ntimes the services were punctuated by much shouting from the \"happy\r\nones.\" At these services the sacrament was served to those who had\r\naccepted Christ, those who had not, and were willing to accept Him were\r\nreceived and prepared for baptism on the next visit of \"Father Page.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day of baptism, the candidates were attired in long white flowing\r\nrobes, which had been made by one of the slaves. Amidst singing and\r\npraises they marched, being flanked on each side by other believers, to\r\na pond or lake on the plantation and after the usual ceremony they were\r\n\"ducked\" into the water. This was a day of much shouting and praying.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation. The two \"missy\" girls of the Randolph family were dutiful\r\neach Sunday morning to teach the slaves their catechism or Sunday School\r\nlesson. Aside from this there was no other training.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe War and Freedom. Mr. Napoleon relates that the doctor's two oldest\r\nsons went to the war with the Confederate army, also the white \"driver,\"\r\nBarton. His place was filled by one of the slaves, named Peter Parker.\r\n\r\nAt the closing of the war, word was sent around among the slaves that if\r\nthey heard the report of a gun, it was the Yankees and that they were\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nIt was in May, in the middle of the day, cotton and corn being planted,\r\nplowing going on, and slaves busily engaged in their usual activities,\r\nwhen suddenly the loud report of a gun resounded, then could be heard\r\nthe slaves crying almost en-masse, \"dems de Yankees.\" Straightway they\r\ndropped the plows, hoes and other farm implements and hurried to their\r\ncabins. They put on their best clothes \"to go see the Yankees.\" Through\r\nthe countryside to the town of Tallahassee they went. The roads were\r\nquickly filled with these happy souls. The streets of Tallahassee were\r\nclustered with these jubilant people going here and there to get a\r\nglimpse of the Yankees, their liberators. Napoleon says it was a joyous\r\nand un-forgetable occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen the Randolph slaves returned to their plantation, Dr. Randolph told\r\nthem that they were free, and if they wanted to go away, they could, and\r\nif not, they could remain with him and he would give them half of what\r\nwas raised on the farms. Some of them left, however, some remained,\r\nhaving no place to go, they decided it was best to remain until the\r\ncrops came off, thus earning enough to help them in their new venture in\r\nhome seeking. Those slaves who were too old and not physically able to\r\nwork, remained on the plantation and were cared for by Dr. Randolph\r\nuntil their death.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's father, Scipio, got a transfer from the government to his\r\nformer master, Colonel Sammis of Arlington, and there he lived for\r\nawhile. He soon got employment with a Mr. Hatee of the town and after\r\nearning enough money, bought a tract of land from him there and farmed.\r\nThere his family lived and increased. Louis being the oldest of the\r\nchildren obtained odd jobs with the various settlers, among them being\r\nGovernor Reid of Florida who lived in South Jacksonville. Governor Reid\r\nraised cattle for market and Napoleon's job was to bring them across the\r\nSaint Johns River on a litter to Jacksonville, where they were\r\nsold.[HW:?]\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon is now aged and infirm, his father and mother having died\r\nmany years ago. He now lives with one of his younger brothers who has a\r\nfair sized orange grove on the south side of Jacksonville. He retains\r\nthe property that his father first bought after freedom and on which\r\nthey lived in Arlington. His hair white and he is bent with age and ill\r\nhealth but his mental faculties are exceptionally keen for one of his\r\nage. He proudly tells you that his master was good to his \"niggers\" and\r\ncannot recall but one time that he saw him whip one of them and that\r\nwhen one tried to run away to the Yankees. Only memories of a kind\r\nmaster in his days of servitude remain with him as he recalls the dark\r\ndays of slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nPersonal interview with Louis Napoleon, South Jacksonville, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nRachel A.

Austin, Field Worker\r\nMonticello, Florida\r\nNovember 10, 1936\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS PARISH\r\n\r\n\r\nDouglas Parish was born in Monticello, Florida, May 7, 1850, to Charles\r\nand Fannie Parish, slaves of Jim Parish. Fannie had been bought from a\r\nfamily by the name of Palmer to be a \"breeder\", that is a bearer of\r\nstrong children who could bring high prices at the slave markets. A\r\n\"breeder\" always fared better than the majority of female slaves, and\r\nFannie Parish was no exception. All she had to do was raise children.\r\nCharles Parish labored in the cotton fields, the chief product of the\r\nParish plantation.\r\n\r\nAs a small boy Douglas used to spend his time shooting marbles, playing\r\nball, racing and wrestling with the other boys. The marbles were made\r\nfrom lumps of clay hardened in the fireplace. He was a very good runner,\r\nand as it was a custom in those days for one plantation owner to match\r\nhis \"nigger\" against that of his neighbor, he was a favorite with Parish\r\nbecause he seldom failed to win the race. Parish trained his runners by\r\nhaving them race to the boundary of his plantation and back again. He\r\nwould reward the winner with a jack-knife or a bag of marbles.\r\n\r\nJust to be first was an honor in itself, for the fastest runner\r\nrepresented his master in the Fourth of July races when runners from all\r\nover the country competed for top honors, and the winner earned a bag of\r\nsilver for his master. If Parish didn't win the prize, he was hard to\r\nget along with for several days, but gradually he would accept his\r\ndefeat with resolution. Prizes in less important races ranged from a\r\npair of fighting cocks to a slave, depending upon the seriousness of the\r\nbetting.\r\n\r\nDouglas' first job was picking cotton seed from the cotton. When he was\r\nabout 12 years of age, he became the stable boy, and soon learned about\r\nthe care and grooming of horses from an old slave who had charge of the\r\nParish stables. He was also required to keep the buggies, surreys, and\r\nspring-wagons clean. The buggies were light four-wheeled carriages drawn\r\nby one horse. The surreys were covered four-wheeled carriages, open at\r\nthe sides, but having curtains that may be rolled down. He liked this\r\njob very much because it gave him an opportunity to ride on the horses,\r\nthe desire of all the boys on the plantation. They had to be content\r\nwith chopping wood, running errands, cleaning up the plantation, and\r\nsimilar tasks. Because of his knowledge of horses, Douglas was permitted\r\nto travel to the coast with his boss and other slaves for the purpose of\r\nsecuring salt from the sea water. It was cheaper to secure salt by this\r\nmethod than it was to purchase it otherwise.\r\n\r\nLife in slavery was not all bad, according to Douglas. Parish fed his\r\nslaves well, gave them comfortable quarters in which to live, looked\r\nafter them when they were sick, and worked them very moderately. The\r\nfood was cooked in the fireplace in large iron pots, pans and ovens. The\r\nslaves had greens, potatoes, corn, rice, meat, peas, and corn bread to\r\neat. Occasionally the corn bread was replaced by flour bread. The slaves\r\ndrank an imitation coffee made from parched corn or meal. Since there\r\nwas no ice to preserve the left-over food, only enough for each meal was\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nParish seldom punished his slaves, and never did he permit his overseer\r\nto do so. If the slaves failed to do their work, they were reported to\r\nhim. He would warn them and show his black whip which was usually\r\nsufficient. He had seen overseers beat slaves to death, and he did not\r\nwant to risk losing the money he had invested in his. After his death,\r\nhis son managed the plantation in much the same manner as his father.\r\n\r\nBut the war was destined to make the Parishes lose all their slaves by\r\ngiving them their freedom. Even though they were free to go, many of the\r\nslaves elected to remain with their mistress who had always been kind to\r\nthem. The war swept away much of the money which her husband had left\r\nher; and although she would liked to have kept all of her slaves, she\r\nfound it impossible to do so. She allowed the real old slaves to remain\r\non the premises and kept a few of the younger ones to work about the\r\nplantation. Douglas and his parents were among those who remained on the\r\nplantation. His father was a skilled bricklayer and carpenter, and he\r\nwas employed to make repairs to the property. His mother cooked for the\r\nParishes.\r\n\r\nMany of the Negroes migrated North, and they wrote back stories of the\r\n\"new country\" where \"de white folks let you do jes as you please.\" These\r\nstories influenced a great number of other Negroes to go North and begin\r\nlife anew as servants, waiters, laborers and cooks. The Negroes who\r\nremained in the South were forced to make their own living. At the end\r\nof the war, foods and commodities had gone up to prices that were\r\nimpossible for the Negro to pay. Ham, for example, cost 40¢ and 50¢ a\r\npound; lard was 25¢; cotton was two dollars a bushel.\r\n\r\nDouglas' father taught him all that he knew about carpentry and\r\nbricklaying, and the two were in demand to repair, remodel, or build\r\nhouses for the white people. Although he never attended school, Charles\r\nParish could calculate very rapidly the number of bricks that it would\r\ntake to build a house. After the establishing of schools by the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau, Douglas' father made him go, but he did not like the\r\nconfinement of school and soon dropped out. The teachers for the most\r\npart, were white, who were concerned only with teaching the ex-slaves\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic. The few colored teachers went into\r\nthe community in an effort to elevate the standards of living. They went\r\ninto the churches where they were certain to reach the greatest number\r\nof people and spoke to them of their mission. The Negro teachers were\r\ncordially received by the ex-slaves who were glad to welcome some\r\n\"Yankee niggers\" into their midst.\r\n\r\nWhereas the white teachers did not bother with the Negroes except in the\r\nclassroom, other white men came who showed a decided interest in them.\r\nThey were called \"carpetbaggers\" because of the type of traveling bag\r\nwhich they usually carried, and this term later became synonymous with\r\n\"political adventurer.\" These men sought to advance their political\r\nschemes by getting the Negroes to vote for certain men who would be\r\nfavorable to them. They bought the Negro votes or put a Negro in some\r\nunimportant office to obtain the goodwill of the ex-slaves. They used\r\nthe ignorant colored minister to further their plans, and he was their\r\nwilling tool. The Negro's unwise use of his ballot plunged the South\r\nfurther and further into debt and as a result the South was compelled to\r\nrestrict his privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1.

Muse, Field Worker\r\nPalatka, Florida\r\nNovember 9, 1936\r\n\r\nGEORGE PRETTY\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Pretty of Vero Beach and Gifford, Florida, was born a free man,\r\nat Altoona, Pennsylvania, January 30, 1852. His father Isaac Pretty was\r\nalso free born. His maternal grand-father Alec McCoy and his paternal\r\ngrand-father George Pretty were born slaves who lived in the southern\r\npart of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHe does not know how his father came to be born free but knows that he\r\nwas told that from early childhood.\r\n\r\nIn Altoona, according to George, there were no slaves during his life\r\nthere but in southern Pennsylvania slavery existed for a time. His\r\ngrand-parents moved from southern Pennsylvania during slavery but\r\nwhether they bought their freedom or ran away from their masters was\r\nnever known to George.\r\n\r\nAs in most of the southland, the customs of the Negro in Altoona\r\nabounded in superstition and ignorance. They had about the same beliefs\r\nand looked upon life with about the same degree of intelligence as\r\nNegroes in the south.\r\n\r\nThe north being much colder than the south naturally had long ago used\r\ncoal for fuel. Open grates were used for cooking just as open fireplaces\r\nwere used in the south. Iron skillets or spiders as they called them,\r\nwere used for cooking many foods, meats, vegetables, pies puddings and\r\neven cakes were baked over the fire.\r\n\r\nThe old familiar, often referred to as southern ash cake, was cooked on\r\nthe hearth under the grate, right in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The north\r\nbecause of its rapid advance in the use of modern ways of cooking and\r\ndoing many other things has been thought by many people to have escaped\r\nthe crude methods of cooking, but not so. George told how a piece of\r\nthick paper was placed on the hearth under the grate and corn dough put\r\nupon it to bake. Hot ashes were raked over it and it was left to cook\r\nand brown. When it had remained a long enough time, the ashes were\r\nshaken off, the cake brushed clean with a cloth and no grit was\r\nencountered when it was eaten.\r\n\r\nIsaac Pretty, George's father owned a large harness shop at Altoona and\r\nmade and sold hundreds of dollars worth of saddles and harness to both\r\nnorthern and southern plantation owners. (1)\r\n\r\nThere was a constant going and coming of northern and southern owners;\r\nsouthern ones seeking places to buy implements for farming and other\r\ninventions as well as trying to locate runaway slaves.\r\n\r\nAbolitionists were active in the north and there were those who\r\nassisted slaves across the boundary lines between free and slave states.\r\n\r\nNegroes in the north who were free and had intelligence enough saw the\r\ngravity in assisting their slave brothers in the south. Some risked\r\ntheir lives in spreading propaganda which they thought would aid the\r\nenslaved Negroes in becoming free.\r\n\r\nIn and around Altoona, Negroes were very progressive and appreciated\r\ntheir freedom, and had a great deal of sympathy for their fellows and\r\ndid all they could to demonstrate their attitude toward the slave\r\ntraffic. Money was solicited and freely given to help abolitionists\r\nspread propaganda about freedom.\r\n\r\nIt is striking to note the similarity of living conditions in\r\nPennsylvania and Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas. Ex-slaves who live\r\nin Florida now but who came here since the Emancipation of the Negro\r\ntell of living conditions of their respective states; they are very\r\nsimilar to the modes of living in Altoona, during slavery. (2)\r\n\r\nSoap was made from grease and lye just as it was made in the south.\r\nShin-plaster (paper money similar to green back, which represented\r\namounts less than a dollar) were very plentiful and after the Civil War\r\nconfederate money of all kinds was as so much trash.\r\n\r\nFood stuffs which were raised on the farm at Altoona were: corn,\r\npeanuts, white potatoes and peas. Enough peas were raised to feed the\r\nstock and take care of the family for 18 months. Potatoes were raised in\r\nlarge quantities and after they were dug they were banked for the\r\nwinter. By banked, it is meant, large holes were dug in the cellar of\r\nthe house or under the house or inside of an outhouse; pine straw was\r\nput into this pit and the potatoes piled in; more straw was laid on and\r\nmore potatoes piled in until all were in the pit. Dirt was shoveled over\r\nthe lot and it was left until for using them. Northern people used and\r\nstill use a large amount of white, or Irish potatoes.\r\n\r\nIn curing hides of cows for making leather the same method was employed\r\nas that used in the south. Hides were first salted and water was poured\r\nover them. They were covered with dirt and left to soak a few days. A\r\nsolution of red oak bark was made by soaking the bark in water and this\r\nsolution was poured over the hides. After it soaked a few days the hair\r\nwas scraped off with a stiff brush and when it dried leather was ready\r\nfor making shoes and harness.\r\n\r\nGeorge's father dealt extensively in leather and when he could not get\r\nenough cured himself, he bought of others who could supply him.\r\n\r\nNow George's mother was very handy at the spinning wheel and loom. He\r\nremembers how the bunch of cotton was combed in preparation for\r\nspinning. Cards with teeth were arranged on the spinning wheel and the\r\nmass of cotton was combed through it to separate it into fibers. The\r\nfibers were rolled between the fingers and then put upon the spinning\r\nwheel to be spun into thread. As it was spun, it was wound upon spools.\r\nAfter the spools were filled they were taken off and put on the loom.\r\nThreads were strung across the loom some above others and the shuttle\r\nrunning back and forth through the threads would make cloth. All that\r\nwas done by hand power. A person working at the loom regularly soon\r\nbecame proficient and George's mother was one who bore the name of being\r\na very good weaver of cloth. Most of the clothes the family wore were\r\nhome spun.\r\n\r\nUnderwear and sleeping garments were made of the natural colored\r\nhomespun cloth. When colored cloth was wanted a dye was made to dip them\r\nin so as to get the desired color. Dyes were made by soaking red oak\r\nbark in water. Another was made of elder berries and when a real blood\r\nred was desired polk berries were used. Polk berries made a blood red\r\ndye and was considered very beautiful. Walnut hulls were used to make\r\nbrown dye and it was lasting in its effects.\r\n\r\nIn making dye hold its color, the cloth and dye were boiled together.\r\nAfter it had \"taken\" well, the cloth was removed from the dye and rinsed\r\nwell, the rinse water was salted so as to set the color.\r\n\r\nTubs for washing clothes and bathing purposes were made of wood. Some\r\nwere made from barrels out in tew parts. In cutting a stay was left\r\nlonger on each side and holes were cut length wise in it so there would\r\nbe sufficient room for all of the fingers to fit. That was for lifting\r\nthe tub about.\r\n\r\nA very interesting side of George's life was depicted in his statement\r\nof the longevity of his innocence. We may call it ignorance but it seems\r\nto be more innocence when compared to the incident of Adam and Eve as\r\ntold in the Holy Bible in the book of Genesis. He was 33 years of age\r\nbefore he knew he was a grown man, or how life was given humans. In\r\nplain words he did not know where babies came from, nor how they were\r\nbred.\r\n\r\nWhenever George's mother was expecting to be confined with a baby's\r\nbirth, his father would say to all the children together, large and\r\nsmall alike, \"your mother has gone to New York, Baltimore, Buffalo\" or\r\nany place he would think of at the time. There was an upstairs room in\r\ntheir home and she would stay there six weeks. She would go up as soon\r\nas signs of the coming child would present themselves. A midwife came,\r\ncooked three meals a day, fed the children and helped keep the place in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nIn older times people taught their children to respect older persons.\r\nThey obeyed everyone older than themselves. The large children were just\r\nas obedient as the small ones so that it was not hard to maintain peace\r\nand order within any home.\r\n\r\nThe midwife in this case simply told all of the children that she did\r\nnot want any of them to go upstairs, as she had important papers spread\r\nout all over the floor and did not want them disturbed. No questions\r\nwere asked, she was obeyed.\r\n\r\nGeorge does not remember having heard a single cry the whole time they\r\nwere being born in that upper room, and he said many a baby was born\r\nthere. Decorum reigned throughout the household for six weeks or until\r\ntheir mother was ready to come down. When the time was up for mother to\r\ncome down, his father would casually say, \"children your ma is coming\r\nhome today and what do you recon, someone has given her another baby.\"\r\nThe children would say, almost in concert, \"what you say pa, is it a boy\r\nor girl?\" He would tell them which it was and nothing more was said nor\r\nany further inquiry made into the happening.\r\n\r\nThe term \"broke her leg\" was used to convey the meaning of pregnancy.\r\nGeorge relates how his mother told him and his sister not to have any\r\nthing more to do with Mary Jones, \"cause she done broke her leg.\" George\r\nsaid \"Ma taint nothin matter wid Mary; I see her every day when the bell\r\nrings for 12; she works across the street from Pa's shop and she and me\r\nsets on the steps and talks till time fur her to go back to work.\" His\r\nmother said, \"dont spute me George, I know she is broke her leg and I\r\nwant yall to stay way frum her.\" George said, \"Ma I aint sputing you,\r\njes somebody done misinform you dats all. She aint got no broke leg,\r\nshe walks as good as me.\" His mother said \"then I'm a lie.\" George\r\nquickly replied, \"no ma, you aint no lie, but somebody done told you\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nNothing was said further on the question of Mary Jones until that same\r\nevening when Isaac Pretty came home from the shop. The mother took him\r\naside and told him of how she had been disputed and called a lie by\r\nGeorge and added that she wanted George whipped for it.\r\n\r\n\"Come here George,\" came a commanding voice shortly after the mother and\r\nfather had been in conference. George obeyed and his father took him\r\napart from the family and locked himself and George in a room. He said\r\n\"George I know I haven't done right by not telling you, you are grown.\r\nYou are 33 years old now and I want to tell you some things you should\r\nknow.\" George was all eyes and ears, for he had been told when\r\npreviously asked how old he was, \"I'll tell you when you get grown.\"\r\nThat was all he had heard from his parents for years and he was just\r\nwaiting for him to tell him. His father told him how babies were born\r\nand about his mother confining herself in the upper room all the\r\ndifferent times when she expected babies. He told him that his mother\r\nhad never been out of town to Boston or Baltimore on any of the past\r\noccasions. In fact he told George all he knew to tell him.\r\n\r\nNow the startling thing about it all is that when he had finished\r\ngiving the information about babies he said, \"Now George your mother\r\ntold me that you called her a lie today.\" George at once said, \"Pa I\r\ndidn't call her a lie, I jes told someone had misinform her 'bout Mary,\r\nthat she aint got her leg broke cause I see her every day.\" His father\r\nsaid \"I know 'taint right to whip you fur that George but your Ma said\r\nshe wanted me to whip you and I'll have to do it.\" That settled it.\r\nGeorge received his first lesson in sex and received the last flogging\r\nhis father ever gave him. He was now grown and could take his place as a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the mother took all her daughters aside and told them the\r\nsame as Isaac had told George. (That is she told the grown girls about\r\nsex life.)\r\n\r\nGeorge and his older sister talked the whole plan over after they got a\r\nchance and decided that since they were now grown, they did not have to\r\ngive their earnings to their parents any longer. They decided to move\r\ninto one of their father's houses on the place and furnish it up. They\r\nwere making right good money considering the times related George, and\r\nwith both of them pulling together they soon would have sufficient money\r\nsaved up to buy a piece of land and start out on a plot of ground of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nGeorge told his father their plans. His father asked how much money he\r\nhad. He told him 200 dollars or more. His father said \"you've saved 200\r\ndollars out of what I've allowed you?\" George answered in the\r\naffirmative. His father said, \"do you know how far that will go?\" George\r\nsaid he did not, his father answered \"Not far my boy.\"\r\n\r\nA few days after the conversation, Isaac Pretty furnished one of his\r\nhouses with the necessary equipment and let George and his sister live\r\nthere. They had their own bed-rooms and each bought some food. The girl\r\nand George both cooked the meals and did the main thing they had set out\r\nto do, letting nothing stand in the way of their progress.\r\n\r\nWhen a few months had passed both children had accumulated a nice sum of\r\nmoney. George was prepared to marry and take care of a wife. His sister\r\nEliza, who lived with him had saved almost as much money and when she\r\nmarried she was an asset to the man of her choice rather than a\r\nliability.\r\n\r\nGeorge had close contact with nature in his early life. The close\r\ncontact with his mother for 33 years had done something for George which\r\nwas lasting as well as beneficial. She was a close adherent to nature.\r\nShe believed in and knew the roots and herbs which cured bodily\r\nailments. This was handed down to her children and George Pretty claims\r\nto know every root and herb in the woods. He can identify each as they\r\nare presented to him, says he.\r\n\r\nDoctors were never used by the ordinary family when George was growing\r\nup and during his stay at Altoona. He was called in to sew up a cut\r\nplace which was too much for home treatment. He was also called in to\r\nprobe for a bullet but for fever or colds or even child-birth he was\r\nconsidered an unnecessary expense.\r\n\r\nHerbs and roots were widely utilized in olden days and during slavery\r\nand early reconstruction. The old slave has brought his practices to\r\nthis era and he is often found gathering and using them upon his friends\r\nand neighbors.\r\n\r\nGeorge Pretty knows that black snake root is good for blood trouble for\r\nhe has used it on many a person with safety and surety. Sasafras tea is\r\ngood for colds; golden rod tea for fever; fig leaves for thrash; red oak\r\nbark for douche; slippery elm for fever and female complaint (when bark\r\nis inserted in the vagina); catnip tea is good for new born babies; sage\r\ntea is good for painful menstruation or slackened flow; fig leaves\r\nbruised and applied to the forehead for fever are very affective; they\r\nare also good to draw boils to a head; okra blossoms when dried are good\r\nfor sores (the dried blossoms are soaked in water and applied to the\r\nsore and bound with clean old linen cloth); red shank is good for a\r\nnumber of diseases; missing link root is for colds and asthma. George\r\nsaid this is a sure cure for asthma. Fever grass is a purgative when\r\ntaken in the form of a tea. The blades are steeped in hot water and a\r\ntea made. Fever grass is a wide blade grass growing straighter than most\r\ngrass. It has a blue flower and is found growing wild around many places\r\nin Florida. It is plentiful in certain parts of Palatka, Florida.\r\n\r\nRiding vehicles in early days were called buggies. The first one George\r\nremembers was the go cart. It had two wheels and was without a top. Only\r\ntwo people could ride in a go cart. The equilibrium was kept by buckling\r\nthe harness over and under the horse's belly. The strap which ran under\r\nthe belly was called the belly girt. There was a side strap which ran\r\nalong the horse's side and the belly girt was fastened to this. Loops\r\nwere put to vantage points on the side strap and through these the\r\nshafts of the cart were run. The strap going under and over the horse\r\nkept the cart from going too far forward or backward.\r\n\r\nDuring George's early life plows looked very much like they do today.\r\nThey had wooden handles but the part which turned the ground was made of\r\npoint iron, (he could not describe point iron.) Plows were not made of\r\ncast iron or steel as they are today.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of plows were used so far as George remembers. One was called\r\nthe skooter plow and the other the turn plow. The skooter plow he\r\ndescribes as one which broke the ground up which had been previously\r\nplanted. When the earth needed loosening up to make more fit for\r\nplanting, this plow was used over the earth, leaving it rather smooth\r\nand light. The turn plow was used to turn the ground completely over.\r\nWhere grass and weeds had grown, the earth needed turning over so as to\r\nthoroughly uproot the weeds and grass. The ground was usually left a\r\nwhile so that the weeds could die and rot and then men with hoes would\r\ngo over the ground and make it ready for planting.\r\n\r\nWhen freedom came to Negroes in the slave territory, George remembers\r\nthat Sherman's army drilled a long time after the Civil War had ended.\r\nHe saw them right in Pennsylvania. He was much impressed with their blue\r\nsuits and brass buttons and which fitted them so well. Some of the men\r\nwore suits with braid on them and they supposedly were the officers of\r\nthe outfit. Negro and white men were in the same companies he saw and\r\nall were manly and walking proudly.\r\n\r\nAs George was fifteen years of age when freedom came much of which he\r\nrelated happened after Emancipation. He being out of the slave territory\r\ndid not have as much contact with the slaves, but he lived around his\r\ngrand parents who had been slaves in the southern part of the state.\r\nAfter slavery they moved up to Altoona, with George's parents and\r\nbrought much in the way of customs to George.\r\n\r\nGrandfather McCoy and also grandfather Pretty told of many experiences\r\nthat they went through during their enslavement. The Negro and white\r\nover-seer was much in evidence down there and buying and selling of\r\nchildren from their parents seemed to have left a sad memory with\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\nIsaac Pretty's family was large. He had seven girls and seven boys,\r\nGeorge being the eldest. George remembers how his heart would ache when\r\nhis grandfather told of the children who were torn from their mother's\r\nskirts and sold, never to see their parents again. He went into deep\r\nthought over how he would have hated to have been separated from his\r\nmother and father to say nothing of leaving his brothers and sisters.\r\nThey were brought up to love each other and the thought of breaking the\r\nfamily ties seemed to him very cruel.\r\n\r\nWhen George was told that he was grown as formerly related, he saved his\r\nmoney and when the great earth quake in Charleston occured he went down\r\nthere to see what it had done to the place. Before that time in 1882 he\r\nremembered having seen the first block of ice. When he got there, the\r\nCharleston people had been making ice for a few years. It was about that\r\ntime that George saw the first pair of bed springs.\r\n\r\nGeorge remained in Pennsylvania and other states farther north for a\r\nlong time after freedom. His first trip to Florida was made in 1893. He\r\ncame direct from Altoona, Pennsylvania, with a white man whose name he\r\nhas forgotten as he did not remain in the man's employ very long after\r\nreaching the state.\r\n\r\nSince that time he has farmed in and around different parts of Florida,\r\nbut now he resides at Tero Beach and Gifford, Florida. He makes regular\r\ntrips to Palatka, being as much at home there as in the cities on the\r\nEast Coast.\r\n\r\nGeorge says that he has never had a doctor attend him in his life,\r\nneither while he was in Altoona, nor since he has been in Florida. He\r\nclaims to be able to identify any root or herb that grows in the woods\r\nin the State of Florida having studied them constantly since his arrival\r\nhere. Before coming to this state he knew all the roots and herbs around\r\nAltoona and it still acquainted with them as he makes regular visits\r\nthere, since he moved away 43 years ago. (1)\r\n\r\nGeorge Pretty is a dark complexioned man; about five feet three inches\r\nin heighth; weighs about 135 pounds and looks to be much younger than he\r\nis. When asked how he had maintained his youth, he said that living\r\nclose to nature had done it together with his manner of living. He does\r\nnot dissipate, neither does he drink strong drink. He is a ready\r\ninformant. Having heard that only information of slavery was wanted, he\r\nvolunteered information without any formality or urging on the part of\r\nthe writer.

Muse, Field Worker\r\nJacksonville, Fla.\r\nJanuary 11, 1937\r\n\r\nANNA SCOTT\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EX-SLAVE WHO WENT TO AFRICA\r\n\r\nAnna Scott, an ex-slave who now lives in Jacksonville near the\r\nintersection of Moncrief and Edgewood Avenues, was a member of one of\r\nthe first colonization groups that went to the West coast of Africa\r\nfollowing the emancipation of the slaves in this country.\r\n\r\nThe former slave was born at Dove City, South Carolina, on Jan. 28,\r\n1846, of a half-breed Cherokee-and-Negro mother and Anglo-Saxon father.\r\nHer father owned the plantation adjoining that of her master.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the adolescent age Anna was placed under the direct\r\ncare of her mistress, by whom she was given direct charge of the\r\ndining-room and entrusted with the keys to the provisions and supplies\r\nof the household.\r\n\r\nA kindred love grew between the slave girl and her mistress; she recalls\r\nthat everywhere her mistress went she was taken also. She was kept in\r\n'the big house'. She was not given any education, though, as some of the\r\nslaves on nearby plantations were.\r\n\r\nReligion was not denied to the former slave and her fellows. Mrs.\r\nAbigail Dever[TR:?], her owner, permitted the slaves to attend revival\r\nand other services. The slaves were allowed to occupy the balcony of\r\nthe church in Dove City, while the whites occupied the main floor. The\r\nslaves were forbidden to sing, talk, or make any other sound, however,\r\nunder penalty of severe beatings.\r\n\r\nThose of the slaves who 'felt the sperrit' during a service must keep\r\nsilence until after the service, when they could 'tell it to the\r\ndeacon', a colored man who would listen to the confessions or\r\nprofessions of religion of the slaves until late into the night. The\r\nNegro deacon would relay his converts to the white minister of the\r\nchurch, who would meet them in the vestry room at some specified time.\r\n\r\nSome of the questions that would be asked at these meetings in the\r\nvestry room would be:\r\n\r\n\"What did you come up here for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I got religion\".\r\n\r\n\"How do you know you got religion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I know my sins are forgive\".\r\n\r\n\"How do you know your sins are forgiven?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I love Jesus and I love everybody\".\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to be baptized?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want to be baptized?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cause it will make me like Jesus wants me to be\".\r\n\r\nWhen several persons were 'ready', there would be a baptism in a nearby\r\ncreek or river. After this, slaves would be permitted to hold occasional\r\nservives of their own in the log house that was sometimes used as a\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nMrs. Scott remembers vividly the joy that she felt and other slaves\r\nexpressed when first news of their emancipation was brought to them.\r\nBoth she and her mistress were fearful, she says; her mistress because\r\nshe did not know what she would do without her slaves, and Anna because\r\nshe thought the Union soldiers would harm Mrs. Dove. When the chief\r\nofficer of the soldiers came to the home of her mistress, she says, he\r\ndemanded entrance in a gruff voice. Then he saw a ring upon Mrs. Dove's\r\nfinger and asked: \"Where did you get this?\" When told that the ring\r\nbelonged to her husband, who was dead, the officer turned to his\r\nsoldiers and told them that they should \"get back; she's alright!\"\r\n\r\nProvisions intended for the Confederate armies were broken open by the\r\nUnion soldiers and their followers, and Anna's mother, to protect her\r\nmaster, organized groups of slaves to 'tote the meat from the box cars\r\nand hide it in dugouts under the mistress' house'. This meat was later\r\ndivided between Negroes and whites.\r\n\r\nA Provost Judge followed the advance of the army, and he obtained a list\r\nof all of the slaves held by each master. Mrs. Dove gave her list to the\r\nofficial, who called each slave by name and asked what that slave had\r\ndone on the plantation. He asked, also, whether any payment had been\r\nmade to them since the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed, and\r\nwhen answered in the negative told them that 'You are free now and must\r\nbe paid for all of the work you have done since the Proclamation was\r\nsigned and that you will do in the future. Don't you work for anybody\r\nwithout pay'.\r\n\r\nThe Provost Judge also told the slaves that they might leave if they\r\nliked, and Anna was among those who left. She went to visit the husband\r\nof her mother in Charleston. With her mother and five other children,\r\nAnna crossed rivers on log rafts and rode on trains to Charleston.\r\n\r\nElias Mumford was Anna's step-father in Charleston, and after spending a\r\nyear there with him the entire family joined a colonizing expedition to\r\nWest Africa. There were 650 in the expedition, and it left in 1867.\r\nTransportation was free.\r\n\r\nThe trip took several weeks, but finally the small ship landed at Grand\r\nBassa. Mumford did not like the place, however, and continued on to\r\nMonrovia, Liberia. He did not like Monrovia, either, and tried several\r\nother ports before being told that he would have to get off, anyway.\r\nThis was at Harper Cape, W. Africa.\r\n\r\nHere he almost immediately began an industry that was to prove\r\nlucrative. Oysters were 'large as saucers', according to Anna, and while\r\nthe family gathered these he would burn them and extract lime from them.\r\nThis he mixed with the native clay and made brick. In addition to his\r\nbrick-making Mumford cut trees for lumber, and with his own brick and\r\nlumber would construct houses and structures. One such structure brought\r\nhim $1100.00.\r\n\r\nAnother manner in which Mumford added to his growing wealth was through\r\nthe cashing of checks for the Missionaries of the section. Ordinarily\r\nthey would have to send these back to the United States to be cashed,\r\nand when he offered to cash them--at a discount--they eagerly utilized\r\nthe opportunity to save time; this was a convenience for them and more\r\nwealth for Mumford.\r\n\r\nAnna found other things besides happiness in her eight years in Africa.\r\nThere were death, sickness, and pestilences. She mentions among the\r\nlatter the African ants, some of which reached huge proportions. Most\r\ndreaded were the Mission ants, which infested every house, building and\r\nstructure. Sometimes buildings had to be burned to get rid of them. The\r\nbite of these ants was so serious that after sixty years Anna still\r\nexhibits places on her feet where the ants left their indelible traces.\r\nAnother of the ant pests was the Driver ant, so large, powerful and\r\nstubborn that even bodies of water did not stop them. They would join\r\nthemselves together above the surface of the water and serve as bridges\r\nfor the passage of the other ants. The Driver ants moved in swarms and\r\ntheir approach could be seen at great distances. When they were seen to\r\nbe coming toward a settlement the natives would close their doors and\r\nwindows and build fires around their homes to avoid them. These fires\r\nhad to be kept burning for weeks.\r\n\r\nEight and more persons died a day from the African fever during the\r\nearly colonization attempts; three of these in Anna's family alone were\r\nvictims of it. It was generally believed that if a victim of the fever\r\nbecame wet by dew he was sure to die.\r\n\r\nAfter eight years Mumford and the remainder of his family returned to\r\nAmerica, where the accrued checks he possessed for cashing made him\r\nreasonably wealthy. Anna married Robert Scott and moved to Jacksonville,\r\nwhere she has lived since.\r\n\r\nAt ninety-one she still occupies the little farm on the outskirts of\r\nJacksonville that was purchased with the money left to her out of her\r\nmother's inheritance (from the African transactions of Mumford) and\r\nRobert's post-slavery savings, and in front of her picturesque little\r\ncottage spins yarns for the neighbors of her early experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nInterview with subject, Mrs. Anna Scott, Edgewood and Moncrief Avenues\r\n(Route 2, Box 911) Jacksonville, Fla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nJ.M. Johnson, Field Worker\r\nJohn A. Simms, Editor\r\nChaseville, Florida\r\nAugust 28, 1936\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SHERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chaseville, Florida, about twelve miles from Jacksonville on the\r\nsouth side of the Saint Johns River lives William Sherman (locally\r\npronounced _Schumann_,) a former slave of Jack Davis, nephew of\r\nPresident Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy. (1)\r\n\r\nWilliam Sherman was born on the plantation of Jack Davis, about five\r\nmiles from Robertsville, South Carolina, at a place called \"Black\r\nSwamp,\" June 12, 1842, twenty-three years prior to Emancipation. His\r\nfather who was also named William Sherman, was a free man, having bought\r\nhis freedom for eighteen hundred dollars from his master, John Jones,\r\nwho also lived in the vicinity of the Davis' plantation. William\r\nSherman, senior, bargained with his master to obtain his freedom,\r\nhowever, for he did not have the money to readily pay him. He hired\r\nhimself out to some of the wealthy plantation owners and applied what he\r\nearned toward the payment for his freedom. He was a skilled blacksmith\r\nand cabinet maker and his services were always in demand. After\r\nprocuring his freedom he bought a tract of land from his former master\r\nand built a home and blacksmith shop on it. As was the custom during\r\nslavery, a person who bought his freedom had to have a guardian;\r\nSherman's former master, John Jones, acted as his guardian. Under this\r\nnew order of things Sherman was in reality his own master. He was not\r\n\"bossed,\" had his own hours, earned and kept his money, and was at\r\nliberty to leave the territory if he desired. However, he remained and\r\nmarried Anna Georgia, the mother of William Sherman, junior. She was\r\nalso a slave of Jack Davis. After William Sherman, senior, finished his\r\nday's work he would go to the Davis plantation to visit his wife and\r\nsometimes remain for the night. It was his intention to purchase the\r\nfreedom of his wife Anna Georgia, and their son William, but he died\r\nbefore he had sufficient money to do so, and also before the Civil War,\r\nwhich he predicted would ensue between the North and South. His son\r\nWilliam says that he remembers well the events that led up to his\r\nfather's burial; he states that the white people dug his grave which was\r\nsix feet deep. It took them three days in which to dig it on account of\r\nthe hardness of the clay; when it was finished he was put sorrowfully\r\naway by the white folk who thought so much of him. William was a boy of\r\nnine at that time, and he remembers that his mother was so grieved that\r\nhe tried to console her by telling her not to worry \"papa's goin' to\r\ncom' back and bring us some more quails\" (he had been accustomed to\r\nbringing them quails during his life) but William sorrowingly said \"he\r\nnever did come back.\"\r\n\r\nAnna Georgia was a cook and general house woman in the Davis' home. She\r\nwas a half breed, her mother being a Cherokee Indian. Her husband,\r\nWilliam, was a descendant of the Cheehaw Indians, some of his a forbears\r\nbeing full-blooded Cheehaws. Their Indian blood was fully evident,\r\nstates William junior. The Davis family tree as he knew it was as\r\nfollows: three brothers, Sam, Thomas and Jefferson Davis (President of\r\nthe Confederacy.) Sam was the eldest of the three and had four children,\r\nviz: Jack, Robert, Richard and Washington. Thomas had four, viz: James,\r\nRichard, Rusha and Minna. Jefferson Davis' family was not known to\r\nWilliam as he lived in Virginia, whereas, the other brothers and their\r\nfamilies lived near each other at \"Black Swamp.\"\r\n\r\nJack Davis, the master of William Sherman, was the son of Sam Davis,\r\nbrother of Jefferson Davis. Thomas and Sam Davis were comparatively\r\nlarge men, while Jefferson was thin and of medium height, resembling to\r\na great extent the late Henry Flagler of Florida East Coast fame, states\r\nWilliam. Many times he would come to visit his brothers at \"Black\r\nSwamp.\" He would drive up in a two-wheeled buggy, drawn by a horse.\r\nOft'times he visited his nephew, Jack and they would get together in a\r\nlengthy conversation. Sometimes he would remain with the Davis family\r\nfor a few days and then return to Virginia. On these visits William\r\nstates that he saw him personally. These visits or sojourns occurred\r\nprior to the Civil War. Jack Davis being a comparatively poor man had\r\nonly eight slaves on his plantation; they were housed in log cabins made\r\nof cypress timber notched together in such a way as to give it the\r\nappearance of having been built regular lumber. It was much larger and\r\nof different architecture than the slave cabins, however.\r\n\r\nThe few slaves that he had arose at 4:00 o'clock in the morning and\r\nprepared themselves for the field. They stopped at noon for a light\r\nlunch which they always took with them and at sun-down they quit work\r\nand went to their respective cabins. Cotton, corn, potatoes and other\r\ncommodities were raised. There was no regular \"overseer\" employed.\r\nDavis, the master acted in that capacity. He was very kind to them and\r\nseldom used the whip. After the outbreak of the Civil War, white men\r\ncalled \"patarollers\" were posted around the various plantations to guard\r\nagainst runaways, and if slaves were caught off their respective\r\nplantations without permits from their masters they were severely\r\nwhipped. This was not the routine for Jack Davis' slaves for he gave\r\nthe \"patarollers\" specific orders that if any of them were caught off\r\nthe plantation without a permit not to molest them but to let them\r\nproceed where they were bound. Will said that one of the slaves ran away\r\nand when he was caught his master gave him a light whipping and told him\r\nto \"go on now and run away if you want to.\" He said the slave walked\r\naway but never attempted to run away again. Will states that he was\r\nsomewhat of a \"pet\" around the plantation and did almost as he wanted\r\nto. He would go hunting, fishing and swimming with his master's sons who\r\nwere about his age. Sometimes he would get into a fight with one of the\r\nboys and many times he would be the victor, his fallen foe would\r\nsometimes exclaim that \"that licking that you gave me sure hurt,\" and\r\nthat ended the affair; there was no further ill feeling between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation: The slaves were not allowed to study. The white children\r\nstudied a large \"Blue Back\" Webster Speller and when one had thoroughly\r\nlearned its contents he was considered to be educated.\r\n\r\n\r\nReligion: The slaves had their own church but sometimes went to the\r\nchurches of their white masters where they were relegated to the extreme\r\nrear. John Kelley, a white man, often preached to them and would\r\nadmonish them as follows; \"you must obey your master and missus, you\r\nmust be good niggers.\" After the beginning of the war they held\r\n\"meetings\" among themselves in their cabins.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaptism: Those slaves who believed and accepted the Christian Doctrine\r\nwere admitted into the church after being baptized in one of the\r\nsurrounding ponds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCruelties: There was a very wealthy plantation owner who lived near the\r\nDavis plantation; he had eleven plantations, the smallest one was\r\ncultivated by three hundred slaves. Oftimes they would work nearly all\r\nnight. Will states that it was not an unusual thing to hear in the early\r\nmornings the echoes of rawhide whips cracking like the report of a gun\r\nagainst the bare backs of the slaves who were being whipped. They would\r\nmoan and groan in agony, but the whipping went on until the master's\r\nwrath was appeased. John Stokes, a white plantation owner who lived near\r\nthe Davis' plantation encouraged slaves to steal from their masters and\r\nbring the stolen goods to him; he would purchase the goods for much less\r\nthan their value. One time one of the slaves \"put it out\" that \"Massa\"\r\nStokes was buying stolen goods. Stokes heard of this and his wrath was\r\naroused; he had to find the \"nigger\" who was circulating this rumor. He\r\nwent after him in great fury and finally succeeded in locating him,\r\nwhereupon, he gave him a good \"lacing\" and warned him \"if he ever heard\r\nanything like that again from him he was going to kill him.\" The\r\naccusations were true, however, but the slave desisted in further\r\ndiscussion of the affair for \"old Massa Stokes was a treacherous man.\"\r\nOn another occasion one of the Stokes' slaves ran away and he sent\r\nSteven Kittles, known as the \"dog man,\" to catch the escape. (The dogs\r\nthat went in pursuit of the runaway slaves were called \"Nigger dogs\";\r\nthey were used specifically for catching runaway slaves.) This\r\nparticular slave had quite a \"head start\" on the dogs that were trailing\r\nhim and he hid among some floating logs in a large pond; the dogs\r\ntrailed him to the pond and began howling, indicating that they were\r\napproaching their prey. They entered the pond to get their victim who\r\nwas securely hidden from sight; they dissapeared and the next seen of\r\nthem was their dead bodies floating upon the water of the pond; they had\r\nbeen killed by the escape. They were full-blooded hounds, such as were\r\nused in hunting escaped slaves and were about fifty in number. The slave\r\nmade his escape and was never seen again. Will relates that it was very\r\ncold and that he does'nt understand how the slave could stand the icy\r\nwaters of the pond, but evidently he did survive it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCivil War: It was rumored that Abraham Lincoln said to Jefferson Davis,\r\n\"work the slaves until they are about twenty-five or thirty years of\r\nage, then liberate them.\" Davis replied: \"I'll never do it, before I\r\nwill, I'll wade knee deep in blood.\" The result was that in 1861, the\r\nCivil War, that struggle which was to mark the final emancipation of the\r\nslaves began. Jefferson Davis' brothers, Sam and Tom, joined the\r\nConfederate forces, together with their sons who were old enough to go,\r\nexcept James, Tom's son, who could not go on account of ill health and\r\nwas left behind as overseer on Jack Davis' plantation. Jack Davis joined\r\nthe artillery regiment of Captain Razors Company. The war progressed,\r\nSherman was on his famous march. The \"Yankees\" had made such sweeping\r\nadvances until they were in Robertsville, South Carolina, about five\r\nmiles from Black Swamp. The report of gun fire and cannon could be heard\r\nfrom the plantation. \"Truly the Yanks are here\" everybody thought. The\r\nonly happy folk were, the slaves, the whites were in distress. Jack\r\nDavis returned from the field of battle to his plantation. He was on a\r\nshort furlough. His wife, \"Missus\" Davis asked him excitedly, if he\r\nthought the \"Yankees\" were going to win. He replied: \"No if I did I'd\r\nkill every _damned nigger_ on the place.\" Will who was then a lad of\r\nnineteen was standing nearby and on hearing his master's remarks, said:\r\n\"The Yankees aint gonna kill me cause um goin to Laurel Bay\" (a swamp\r\nlocated on the plantation.) Will says that what he really meant was that\r\nhis master was not going to kill him because he intended to run off and\r\ngo to the \"Yankees.\" That afternoon Jack Davis returned to the \"front\"\r\nand that night Will told his mother, Anna Georgia, that he was going to\r\nRobertsville and join the \"Yankees.\" He and his cousin who lived on the\r\nDavis' plantation slipped off and wended their way to all of the\r\nsurrounding plantations spreading the news that the \"Yankees\" were in\r\nRobertsville and exhorting them to follow and join them. Soon the two\r\nhad a following of about five hundred slaves who abandoned their\r\nmasters' plantations \"to meet the Yankees.\" En masse they marched\r\nbreaking down fences that obstructed their passage, carefully avoiding\r\n\"Confederate pickets\" who were stationed throughout the countryside.\r\nAfter marching about five miles they reached a bridge that spanned the\r\nSavannah River, a point that the \"Yankees\" held. There was a Union\r\nsoldier standing guard and before he realized it, this group of five\r\nhundred slaves were upon him. Becoming cognizant that someone was upon\r\nhim, he wheeled around in the darkness, with gun leveled at the\r\napproaching slaves and cried \"Halt!\" Will's cousin then spoke up, \"Doan\r\nshoot boss we's jes friends.\" After recognizing who they were, they were\r\nadmitted into the camp that was established around the bridge. There\r\nwere about seven thousand of General Sherman's soldiers camped there,\r\nhaving crossed the Savannah River on a pontoon bridge that they had\r\nconstructed while enroute from Green Springs Georgia, which they had\r\ntaken. The guard who had let these people approach so near to him\r\nwithout realizing their approach was court martialed that night for\r\nbeing dilatory in his duties. The Federal officers told the slaves that\r\nthey could go along with them or go to Savannah, a place that they had\r\nalready captured. Will decided that it was best for him to go to\r\nSavannah. He left, but the majority of the slaves remained with the\r\ntroops. They were enroute to Barnswell, South Carolina, to seize Blis\r\nCreek Fort that was held by the Confederates. As the Federal troops\r\nmarched ahead, they were followed by the volunteer slaves. Most of these\r\nunfortunate slaves were slain by \"bush whackers\" (Confederate snipers\r\nwho fired upon them from ambush.) After being killed they were\r\ndecapitated and their heads placed upon posts that lined the fields so\r\nthat they could be seen by other slaves to warn them of what would\r\nbefall them if they attempted to escape. The battle at Blis Creek Fort\r\nwas one in which both armies displayed great heroism; most of the\r\nFederal troops that made the first attack, were killed as the\r\nConfederates seemed to be irresistible. After rushing up reinforcements,\r\nthe Federals were successful in capturing it and a large number of\r\n\"Rebels.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman's custom was to march ahead of his army and cut rights\r\nof way for them to pass. At this point of the war, many of the slaves\r\nwere escaping from their plantations and joining the \"Yankees.\" All of\r\nthose slaves at Black Swamp who did not voluntarily run away and go to\r\nthe \"Yankees\" were now free by right of conquest of the Federals.\r\n\r\nWill now found himself in Savannah, Georgia, after refusing to go to\r\nBarnswell, South Carolina, with the Federals. This refusal saved him\r\nfrom the fate of his unfortunate brothers who went. Savannah was filled\r\nwith smoke, the aftermath of a great battle. Lying in the \"Broad River\"\r\nbetween Beaufort, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia were two Union\r\ngun boats, the _Wabash_ and _Man O War_, which had taken part in the\r\nbattle that resulted in the capture of Savannah. Everything was now\r\npeaceful again; Savannah was now a Union city. Many of the slaves were\r\njoining the Union army. Those slaves who joined were trained about two\r\ndays and then sent to the front; due to lack of training they were soon\r\nkilled. The weather was cold, it was February, 1862, frost was on the\r\nground. Will soon left Savannah for Beaufort, South Carolina which had\r\nfallen before the \"Yankee\" attack. Soldiers and slaves filled the\r\nstreets. The slaves were given all of the food and clothes that they\r\ncould carry--confiscated goods from the \"Rebels.\" After a bloody\r\nstruggle in which both sides lost heavily and which lasted for about\r\nfive years, the war finally ended May 15, 1865. Will was then a young\r\nman twenty-three years of age and was still in Beaufort. He says that\r\nday was a gala day. Everybody celebrated (except the Southerners). The\r\nslaves were _free_.\r\n\r\nThousands of Federal soldiers were in evidence. The Union army was\r\nvictorious and \"Sherman's March\" was a success. Sherman states that when\r\nJefferson Davis was captured he was disguised in women's clothes.\r\n\r\nSherman states that Florida had the reputation of having very cruel\r\nmasters. He says that when slaves got very unruly, they were told that\r\nthey were going to be sent to Florida so they could be handled. During\r\nthe war thousands of slaves fled from Virginia into Connecticut and New\r\nHampshire. In 1867 William Sherman left Beaufort and went to Mayport,\r\nFlorida to live. He remained there until 1890, then moved to Arona,\r\nFlorida, living there for awhile; he finally settled in Chaseville,\r\nFlorida, where he now lives. During his many years of life he has been\r\nmarried twice and has been the father of sixteen children, all of whom\r\nare dead. He never received any formal education, but learned to read\r\nand studied taxidermy which he practiced for many years.\r\n\r\nHe was at one time Inspector of Elections at Mayport during\r\nReconstruction Days. He recalled an incident that occurred during the\r\nperformance of his duties there, which was as follows: Mr. John Doggett\r\nwho was running for office on the Democratic ticket brought a number of\r\ncolored people to Mayport by boat from Chaseville to vote. Mr. Doggett\r\ndemanded that they should vote, but Will Sherman was equally insistent\r\nthat they should not vote because they had not registered and were not\r\nqualified. After much arguing Mr. Doggett saw that Sherman could not be\r\nmade \"to see the light\" and left with his prospective voters. William\r\nSherman once served upon a United States Federal jury during his\r\ncolorful life.\r\n\r\nIn appearance he could easily be regarded as a phenomenon. He is\r\nninety-four years of age, though he appears to be only about fifty-five.\r\nHis hair is black and not grey as would be expected; his face is round\r\nand unlined; he has dark piercing but kindly eyes. He is of medium\r\nstature. He has an exceptionally alert mind and recalls past events with\r\nthe ease of a youth. The Indian blood that flows in his veins is plainly\r\nvisible in his features, the color of his skin and the texture of his\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nHe gives as his reason for his lengthy life the Indian blood that is in\r\nhim and says that he expects to live for nintey-four more years. Today\r\nhe lives alone. He raises a few vegetables and is content in the\r\nmemories of his past life which has been full. (2)\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1.

Richardson, Field Worker\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nJanuary 27, 1937\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SMALLS\r\n\r\n\r\nA VOLUNTARY SLAVE FOR SEVEN YEARS\r\n\r\nThe story of a free Negro of Connecticut, who came south to observe\r\nconditions of slavery, found them very distasteful, then voluntarily\r\nentered that slavery for seven years is the interesting tale that Samuel\r\nSmalls, 84 year old ex-slave of 1704 Johnson Street, Jacksonville, tells\r\nof his father Cato Smith.\r\n\r\nSmith had been born in Connecticut, son of domestic slaves who were\r\nfreed while he was still a child. He grew to young manhood in the\r\nnorthern state, making a living for himself as a carpenter and builder.\r\nAt these trades he is said to have been very efficient.\r\n\r\nStill unmarried at the age of about 30, he found in himself a desire to\r\ntravel and see how other Negroes in the country lived. This he did,\r\ngoing from one town to another, working for periods of varying length in\r\nthe cities in which he lived, eventually drifting to Florida.\r\n\r\nHis travels eventually brought him to Suwannee County, where he worked\r\nfor a time as overseer on a plantation. On a nearby plantation where he\r\nsometimes visited, he met a young woman for whom he grew to have a great\r\naffection. This plantation is said to have belonged to a family of\r\nCones, and according to Smalls, still exists as a large farm.\r\n\r\nSmith wanted to marry the young woman, but a difficulty developed; he\r\nwas free and she was still a slave. He sought her owner. Smith was told\r\nthat he might have the woman, but he would have to \"work out\" her cost.\r\nHe was informed that this would amount to seven years of work on the\r\nplantation, naturally without pay.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days he was back with his belongings, to begin \"working\r\nout\" the cost of his wife. But his work found favor in his voluntary\r\nmaster's eyes; within four years he was being paid a small sum for the\r\nwork he did, and by the time the seven years was finished, Smith had\r\nenough money to immediately purchase a small farm of his own.\r\n\r\nAdversity set in, however, and eventually his children found themselves\r\nback in slavery, and Smith himself practically again enslaved. It was\r\nduring this period that Smalls was born.\r\n\r\nAll of the Florida slaves were soon emancipated, however and the\r\nvoluntary slave again became a free man. He lived in the Suwannee County\r\nvicinity for a number of years afterward, raising a large family.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\nPersonal interview with Samuel Smalls, ex-slave, 1704 Johnson Street,\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nThe American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nCora N.

Where, and about when, were you born?\r\n\r\nIn Perry, Ga. in 1844.\r\n\r\n2. If you were born on a plantation or farm, what sort of farming\r\nsection was it in?\r\n\r\nOle Dr. Jameson's plantation near Perry, Ga. north of Macon.\r\n\r\n3. How did you pass the time as a child? What sort of chores did you do\r\nand what did you play?\r\n\r\nI worked around the table in my Massy's dining room. I didn't play. I\r\nsometimes pulled threads for mother. She was a fine seamstress for the\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\n4. Was your master kind to you?\r\n\r\nYes; I was the pet.\r\n\r\n5. How many slaves were there on the same plantation or farm?\r\n\r\nHe must have had about 400 slaves.\r\n\r\n6. Do you remember what kind of cooking utensils your mother used?\r\n\r\nWe had copper kettles, crocks, and iron kettles. \"I waited on de table\r\nwhen Lincum came dare. That day we had chicken hash and batter cakes and\r\ndried venison.\"\r\n\r\n7. What were your main foods and how were they cooked?\r\n\r\nWe had everything that was good (I ate in my Massy's kitchen) Sweet\r\npotatoes biscuits, corn bread, pies and everything we eat now.\r\n\r\n8. Do you remember making imitation or substitute coffee by grinding up\r\ncorn or peanuts?\r\n\r\nNo, we always had the best of Java coffee. I used to grind it in the\r\ncoffee mill for my Massy.\r\n\r\n9. Do you remember ever having, when you were young, any other kind of\r\nbread besides corn bread?\r\n\r\nYes. Batter cakes, biscuits and white bread.\r\n\r\n10. Do you remember evaporating sea water to get salt?\r\n\r\nNo. We did not live so far from Macon and the Ole Doctor he was rich and\r\nbought such things. That is how he come to be so rich. He didn't charge\r\nthe poor folks when he doctored them, but they would be so glad that he\r\nmade them well that they kep' a givin' him things, bed quilts, chickens,\r\njust ever' thing. Then he had such a big plantation about 200 or 300\r\nacres, but I didn't live on the plantation. I worked in his home.\r\n\r\n11. When you were a child, what sort of stove do you remember your\r\nmother having. Did they have a hanging pot in the fire place, and did\r\nthey make their candles of their own tallow?\r\n\r\nMy mother did not cook,--she was a special seamstress servant. They had\r\nfireplaces on the plantation and they always used tallow candles at the\r\ndoctor's place until after the 'mancipation, then the doctor was one of\r\nthe first ones to buy coal oil lamps.\r\n\r\n12. Did you use an open well or pump to get the water?\r\n\r\nNo, we went to the spring to get the water. We toted it in cedar\r\nbuckets. The spring was boxed into a well shaped hole, deep enough to\r\ndip the water out of it. It was the best water. They had a town pump at\r\nMacon.\r\n\r\n13. Do you remember when you first saw ice in regular form?\r\n\r\nYes. They had icicles in Georgia.\r\n\r\n14. Did your family work in the rice fields or in the cotton fields on\r\nthe farm, or what sort of work did they do?\r\n\r\nMy father was a blacksmith. He did all kinds of blacksmithing. He even\r\nmade plows.\r\n\r\n15. If they worked in the house or about the place, what sort of work\r\ndid they do?\r\n\r\nMy mother was one of the best seamstresses; she sewed all day long with\r\nher fingers. She made the finest silk dresses and even made tailored\r\nsuits.\r\n\r\n16. Do you remember ever helping tan and cure hides and pig hides?\r\n\r\nThey did those things on the plantation. They cured goat skins and sheep\r\nskins, too. The sheep skins would dry so slowly that they would let the\r\nslaves lie on them at night to keep them warm and hasten the drying.\r\n\r\n17. As a young person what sort of work did you do? If you helped your\r\nmother around the house or cut firewood or swept the yard, say so.\r\n\r\nI cleaned and dusted and waited on the table, made beds and put\r\neverything in order, washed dishes, polished silverware and did the most\r\ntrusty work.\r\n\r\n18. When you were a child do you remember how people wove cloth, or spun\r\nthread, or picked out cotton seed, or weighed cotton, or what sort of\r\nbag was used on the cotton bales?\r\n\r\nI did not need to spin but I used to play with the spinning wheels. They\r\nginned the cotton on the plantation. They used a horse to pull the gin.\r\n\r\nThey weighed the cotton with a beam and weight. A good slave picked 200\r\nlbs of cotton in a day. Nancy could pick 300 or 400 lbs in a day. She'd\r\ngo out early in the day and run in ahead of the sun and no one would\r\nknow she had been out. That's how she would get ahead of the rest.\r\n\r\n19. Do you remember what sort of soap they used? How did they get the\r\nlye for making the soap?\r\n\r\nThey made soft soap boiled in a big kettle. They made the lye out of\r\nashes packed in an old barrel that had a hole in the bottom. They would\r\nmake a hollow in the top of the barrel and pour rain water in it. This\r\nwould gradually soak through the ashes and seep out of the bottom of the\r\nbarrel which they tipped up so that it would drain the lye out into a\r\nvessel. Then they would take the lye and boil it in the kettle with old\r\ngrease and meat rinds. The lye was very strong. They had to be careful\r\nnot to get any of it on their hands or it would take the skin off. As\r\nthey would stir the grease and lye it would foam and cook like a jelly\r\nand when it cooled we had soft soap. It would sure chase the dirt, but\r\nit was hard on the hands.\r\n\r\n20. What did they use for dyeing thread and cloth, and how did they dye\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nThey would dig indigo roots and cook the roots and branches for blue\r\ndye. For purple they mixed red and blue. They would pick the berries off\r\nthe gallberry bushes for red. The robin's yellow and mixed yellow and\r\nred for orange; and yellow and blue for green.\r\n\r\n21. Did your mother use big, wooden washtubs with cut-out holes on each\r\nside for the fingers?\r\n\r\nYes. We made cedar tubs on the plantation. And we had some men who made\r\nlarge wooden bowls out of juggles cut from logs of the tupla tree. They\r\nwould run them through a machine and they would come out round and then\r\nthey would smooth them down. They mixed bread in those big bowls.\r\n\r\n22. Do you remember the way they made shoes by hand in the country?\r\n\r\nYes, all our shoes were made on the plantation.\r\n\r\n23. Do you remember saving the chicken feathers and goose feathers\r\nalways for your featherbeds?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n24. Do you remember when women wore hoops in their skirts, and when they\r\nstopped wearing them and wore narrow skirts?\r\n\r\nYes. The doctor's folks were so stylish that they would not let the\r\nservants wear hoops, but we could get the old ones that they threw away\r\nand have a big time playing with them and we would go around with them\r\non when they were gone and couldn't see us.\r\n\r\n25. Do you remember when you first saw your first windmill?\r\n\r\nNever did see one.\r\n\r\n26. Do you remember when you first saw bed springs instead of bed ropes?\r\n\r\nYes. When I was a slave, I slept in a gunny sack bunk with the sacks\r\nnailed against the wall on two sides, in a corner of the room and then\r\nthere was a post at the corner of the bed and two poles nailed from the\r\npost to the walls and the gunny sacks were nailed to those poles. My bed\r\nwas a two-story bed. There was another gunnysack bed above me with poles\r\nfastened to the same post. We tore old rags and made rag rugs for quilts\r\nto cover us with. I worked in the doctor's house in the daytime but I\r\nhad to sleep in the shed at night. Then after I wasn't a slave no more,\r\nI never slept on anything else but a rope bed. When springs come I\r\nwondered what anyone wanted wid 'em. Rope beds was good enough.\r\n\r\n27. When did you see the first buggy and what did it look like?\r\n\r\nThe doctor, he had the best of such things. He had a regular buggy and\r\nsometimes he driv two horses in hit. Uncle Albert, he wuz his driver.\r\nWhen the doctor wanted to put on great style, and go to the station to\r\nmeet some rich company he had one of the fancy cabs with the driver\r\nsittin' up high in front, but when he went to see his patients, he'd\r\ntake his feet to go around. He had two saddle packs with a strap that he\r\nwould throw over his shoulder. He would have one pack hanging in front\r\nand the other hanging behind.\r\n\r\n28. Do you remember your grandparents?\r\n\r\nNo, my mother's mother was taken from her and sold when she was a baby.\r\nSo I never seed my grandmother and I don't know any more about my\r\ngrandfather than a _goose about a band box_.\r\n\r\n29. Do you remember the money called \"shin-plasters?\"\r\n\r\nI've seen plenty. I guess my master had barrels of them.\r\n\r\n30. What interesting historical events happened during your youth,--such\r\nas Sherman's Army passing through your section? Did you witness the\r\nhappenings and what was the reaction of the other Negroes to them?\r\n\r\nSherman's army went through Perry but they did not do any damage there.\r\nThey expected them to come and buried lots of food and valuable things,\r\nand when they came they took them to the smoke houses and told them to\r\nhelp themselves. They did not burn any houses there.\r\n\r\n31. Did you know any Negros who enlisted or joined the northern army?\r\n\r\nYes, plenty went with their boss, but ran off to Sherman's army when he\r\ncame along. One woman's husband I knowed, Mr. Bethel, he stayed with his\r\nmaster and didn't run off with the Northern army. When he was given his\r\nfreedom, his master give him nice house.\r\n\r\n32. Did you know any Negroes who enlisted in the Southern Army?\r\n\r\nAbout all I knew.\r\n\r\n33. Did your master join the Confederacy? What do you remember of his\r\nreturn from the war? Or was he wounded or killed?\r\n\r\nHis two sons joined the army. James was killed, but Bud, he would never\r\nget through telling war stories when he came back.\r\n\r\n34. Did you live in Savannah when Sherman and the Northern forces marked\r\nthrough the state, and do you remember the excitement in your town or\r\naround the plantation where you lived?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n35. Did your master's house get robbed or burned during the time of\r\nSherman's march?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n36. What kind of uniforms did they wear during the civil war?\r\n\r\nBlue and gray.\r\n\r\n37. What sort of medicine was used in the days just after the war?\r\nDescribe a Negro doctor of that period.\r\n\r\nWe never got sick. Sometimes they would give us oil with a drop or two\r\nof turpentine in a big spoonful. They put turpentine on cuts and sores.\r\n\r\n38. What do you remember about Northern people or outside people moving\r\ninto a community after the war?\r\n\r\nYes, Jake Enos, he was a colored teacher. He was sent down to teach the\r\ncolored school. He taught around from Atlanta to Florida. He took yellow\r\nfever and died My brother, he teached school, but I never went to\r\nschool. I larned my ABC's from my massy's children. I aint _never_\r\nforgot 'em. I could say 'em now.\r\n\r\n39. How did your family's life compare after Emancipation with it\r\nbefore?\r\n\r\nI had it the same. I had it good with my massy, but the rest wuz paid\r\nsome little wages. Our plantation was called a free place. Some of the\r\nslaves worked so well and made money for the massy and gained their\r\nfreedom even befo' 'mancipashun. I heard one come to him and say I howe\r\ndat man $10 an' he retched down in his pocket an' paid hit.\r\n\r\n40. Do you know anything about political meetings and clubs formed after\r\nthe war?\r\n\r\nI heered about de Kuklux but I never did see none.\r\n\r\n41. Do you know anything regarding the letters and stories from Negroes\r\nwho migrated north after the war?\r\n\r\nI hear talk 'bout some massys goin' arter dem an' bringin' back mor'n\r\ndey had in de fust place.\r\n\r\n42. Were there any Negroes of your acquaintance who were skilled in any\r\nparticular line of work, if so give details?\r\n\r\nThe Turners made furniture wid knobs an' bumps on just like that stand\r\nand bed. They made fancy chairs an' put cowhide seats stretch-across\r\n'em.\r\n\r\n43. What sort of school system was there for the instruction of the\r\nNegro? Were there any Negro teachers in your community?\r\n\r\nYes. My son, he went to Negro school three months a year. The son said\r\nthat he studied Webster's Speller, Harvey's Reader, learned his ABC's\r\nand studied some in history, geography and arithmetic.\r\n\r\n44. How old were you at the close of the civil war?\r\n\r\n21 years.\r\n\r\n45. Describe the type of early religious meeting, the preachers, etc.\r\n\r\nI went to town to my massy's church. I sat 'long side on 'em and held\r\nthe baby. My father, he held meetings on the plantation and prayer\r\nmeetings just like they have now.\r\n\r\n46. Do your friends believe in charms and conjure bags, and what has\r\nbeen their experience with magic and spells?\r\n\r\nI guess some claim dey believe in sech things, but I don't know whether\r\nthey do or not.\r\n\r\n47. Did you ever use an ox to plow with? What sort of plow?\r\n\r\nYes, I see 'em plow wid hoxen. Dey used the kind of plows they made on\r\nthe plantation. I didn't plow, but I used to have fun a goin' roun' in\r\nthe old ox two-wheel wagon cart. I'd go down de hill in it; we'd get in\r\nthe dump cart and holler an' have a big time.\r\n\r\n48. How much did various foods and drinks and commodities cost just at\r\nthe end of the war and afterwards?\r\n\r\nI don't know what things cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[HW: Negro-Tampa-Slave Interviews]\r\nJuly 9, 1937\r\n\r\nSTORIES OF FLORIDA\r\nPrepared for Use in Public Schools\r\nby the\r\nFederal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration\r\n\r\nA MARINE IN EBONY\r\nBy Jules A. Frost\r\n\r\nDAVE TAYLOR\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a Virginia plantation to Florida, through perils of Indian\r\nwar-fare; shanghaied on a Government vessel and carried 'round the\r\nworld; shipwrecked and dropped into the lap of romance--these are only a\r\nfew of the colorful pages from the unwritten diary of old Uncle Dave,\r\nex-slave and soldier of fortune.\r\n\r\nThe reporter found the old man sitting on the porch of his Iber City\r\nshack, thoughtfully chewing tobacco and fingering his home-made cane. At\r\nfirst he answered in grumpy monosyllables, but by the magic of a good\r\ncigar, he gradually let himself go, disclosing minute details of a most\r\nremarkable series of adventures.\r\n\r\nHis language is a queer mixture of geechy, sea terms and broad \"a's\"\r\nacquired by long association with Nassau \"conchs.\" Married to one of\r\nthese ample-waisted Bahama women, the erst-while rambler and adventurer\r\nproved that rolling stones sometimes become suitable foundations for\r\nhomes--he lived faithfully with the same wife for fifty-one years.\r\n\r\n\"Shippin' 'fore de mahst ain't no job to make a preacher f'm a\r\nyoungster; hit's plenty tough; but I ain't nevah been sorry I went to\r\nsea; effen a boy gwine take to likker an' wimmen, he kin git plenty\r\no'both at home, same as in for'n ports.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man bit off a conservative chew from his small plug, carefully\r\nwrapped the remainder in his handkerchief and chewed thoughtfully for\r\nsome time before he continued.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't bawn in Florida, but I be'n here so long I reckon hit 'bout de\r\nsame thing. I kin jes remember leavin' Norfolk. My daddy an' mammy an'\r\nde odder chillun b'long to a Frenchman named Pinckney. Musta be'n 'bout\r\n1860 or 1861, w'en Mahstah 'gins to worry 'bout what gwine happen effen\r\nwar come an' de Vahginny slave-owners git beat.\"\r\n\r\nHe proceeded slowly, and in language almost unintelligible at times, as\r\nhe talked, smoked and chewed, all at the same time; but here, the\r\nreporter realized, were all the elements of a true story that needed\r\nonly notebook and typewriter to transform it into readable form.\r\n\r\nAntagonism aroused by the Dred Scott decision, and the further\r\nirritation caused by the Fugitive Slave law were kicking up plenty of\r\ntrouble during Buchanan's administration. South Carolina had already\r\nseceded. Major Anderson was keeping the Union flag flying at Fort\r\nSumter, but latest reports said that there was no immediate danger of\r\nhostilities when Pierre Pinckney, thrifty Virginia planter of French\r\nextraction, went into conference with his neighbors and decided to move\r\nwhile the getting-out was still good.\r\n\r\nWith as little publicity as possible, they arranged the disposal of\r\ntheir real estate. No need to sell their slaves and livestock; they\r\nwould need both in the new location. If they could manage to get to\r\nCharleston, they reasoned, surely they could arrange for a boat to St.\r\nAugustine. The Indians might be troublesome there, but by settling near\r\nthe fort they should be reasonably safe.\r\n\r\nBefore the caravan of oxcarts and heavy wagons came within sight of the\r\nold seaport town, it became evident that they had better keep to the\r\nwoods. Union soldiers, although still inactive, might at any time decide\r\nto confiscate their belongings, so they pushed on to the southward.\r\n\r\nLong weeks dragged by before they finally reached St. Augustine. War\r\ntalk, and the possibility of attack by sea again caused them to change\r\ntheir plans. Pooling their money, they chartered a boat and embarked for\r\nKey West. Surely they would be safe that far south. One of their\r\nVirginia neighbors, Fielding A. Browne, had settled there thirty years\r\nbefore. Taking advantage of the periodic sales of salvaged goods from\r\nwrecks on the treacherous keys, he had become wealthy and was said to\r\nhold a responsible position with the city.\r\n\r\nEveryone was in a cheerful mood as the blue outline of Key West peeped\r\nover the horizon, and all come on deck to catch a glimpse of their new\r\nhome. Suddenly dismay clutched at every heart as a Federal man-of-war\r\nswung out of the harbor and steamed out to meet them. The long-feared\r\ncrisis had come. They ware prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nPinckney and his neighbors were marched into Fort Taylor. Their wives,\r\nchildren and slaves were allowed to settle in the city and care for\r\nthemselves as best they could.\r\n\r\nPinckney's slaves consisted of one family, David Taylor and wife, with\r\ntheir family of ten pickaninnies. Colonel Montgomery, Federal recruiting\r\nofficer, took advantage of the helplessness of the slave owners to sow\r\ndiscord among the blacks, and before many days big Dave, father of the\r\nsubject of this sketch, had \"jined de Yankees\" as color sergeant and had\r\nbeen sent north, where he was killed in the attack on Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nHis determined and energetic 260-pound wife served Mrs. Pinckney\r\nfaithfully through the war and long afterward. Young Dave, or \"Buddy,\"\r\nson of big Dave, although only in his early teens, was her chief aid.\r\nWhen the war was over and Mr. Pinckney walked out of Fort Taylor a free\r\nman, the portly Hannah \"pooh-poohed\" the announcement that she was a\r\nfree citizen. \"Y'all done brung me heah,\" she blustered with emphasis,\r\n\"an' heah I'se gwine t' stay.\"\r\n\r\nSome years after the war Pierre Pinckney died. When his good wife became\r\nill, frantic dismay pervaded the servants' quarters. As her last moments\r\ndrew near, Mrs. Pinckney called the weeping Hannah to her bedside and\r\nlaid a bag of money in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"To get you and the children back to old Virginia,\" she whispered with\r\nher last breath.\r\n\r\nWhen the beloved \"Missus\" was laid to rest by the side of her husband in\r\nthe Catholic cemetery, the bewildered Hannah took the money to a white\r\nman, an old friend of the family, and asked him to buy the tickets back\r\nto Virginia. He advised against it; said that the old home would not be\r\nthere to comfort them. Houses had been burned, trees cut down and old\r\nlandmarks destroyed. He suggested that they take the hundred dollars in\r\ngold and buy a little home in Key West, which they did.\r\n\r\nReconstruction days were as trying to Key Westers as to others all over\r\nthe devastated land of Dixie. Slave owners, stripped of their\r\npossessions, taxed with an immense war debt and with no money or\r\nequipment to begin the slow climb back to normalcy were pathetic figures\r\nas they blistered their hands at toil that they had never known before.\r\nMany of the slaves were more than willing to stay with their former\r\nmasters, but with no income, the problem of feeding themselves was the\r\nmain issue with the whites, so it was out of the question to try to fill\r\nother mouths, and ex-slaves often had to shift for themselves, a\r\nhopeless task for a race that had never been called upon to exert\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\nHannah Taylor and her numerous offspring were a fair example of these\r\nirresponsible people. Like a ship adrift without skipper or rudder, they\r\nwere at the mercy of every adverse wind of misfortune. Each morning they\r\nwent out with frantic energy to earn or in some way procure sustenance\r\nfor one more day. Young Dave hounded the sponge fishermen until they\r\ngave him an extra job. He made the rounds of the fishing docks,\r\ncontinually on the lookout to be of help, anxious to do anything at any\r\ntime in exchange for a few articles of food that he could carry proudly\r\nhome to his mother.\r\n\r\n\"Dem was mighty tryin' times,\" mused the old man, \"an' I don't blame my\r\nmammy fer warmin' my pants when she had so much to worry 'bout. She had\r\na way o' grabbin' me by de years an' shovin' my haid twixt her knees\r\nwhilst she wuk on me sumpin' awful. No wonder I was scairt o' dese\r\nframmin's. I reckon dat was de cause o' me goin' t' sea. Ah mas' tell\r\nyou 'bout dat.\r\n\r\n\"One day my mammy gimme fifteen cents an' say 'Go down to de market and\r\nfetch me some fish. Ah' lissen--don't you let no grass grew unda yo'\r\nfeet. Go on de run an' come back on de jump. Does you fall down, jes'\r\nkeep on a-goin' some-how.'\r\n\r\n\"Wid dat she turn an' spit on de step. 'You see dat spit,' she say. 'Ef\r\nhit be dry w'en you git back, I gonna beat de meat offen yo' bones. Git\r\ngoin', now.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, I stahted, an I she' wasn't losin' no time. 'Bout hahf way to de\r\nmahket, I meets a couple o' stewards f'm a U.S. navy cutter anchored off\r\nde navy yard.\r\n\r\n\"Hol' on, dar, boy,' 'dey sing out, 'wha you gwine so fas'? Grab dis\r\nhere basket an' tote hit down to de dock.'\r\n\r\n\"I knowed I couldn't git back home 'fore dat spit dried, an' I be'n\r\nfiggerin' how I could peacify my mammy so's to miss dat beatin'. I\r\nfigger of I mek a quarter or hahf a dollar an' gin it to 'er, she mebbe\r\nforgit de paddlin'. So I take de bahsket an' foller 'em down to de water\r\nfront. W'en we git dere dey was a sailor waitin' fer 'em wid a boat f'm\r\nde cutter. I set de bahsket in de boat an' stood waitin' fo' my money.\r\n\r\n\"You ain't finished yo' job yit,' dey say. 'Git yo'se'f in dat boat an'\r\nput dat stuff on be'd.'\r\n\r\n\"W'en I gits on deck a cullud boy 'bout my size say 'Wanna look about a\r\nbit?' So I foller him below an' fo' I knowed it, I feel de boat kinda\r\nshakin.' I run to a porthole an' look out. Dere was Key West too far\r\naway to swim back to.\r\n\r\n\"I ran up on deck, an' dare was de steward w'at gin me de bahsket to\r\ntote. 'W'at th'ell you doin' on bo'd dis ship,' he ahsk me.\r\n\r\n\"I tells 'im I ain't wantin' t' stay no mo'n he wants me, an' he takes\r\nme to de cap'm. 'I reckon he b'long to do navy now,' says de cap'm, 'so\r\ndey fix some papers an' I makes my mark on 'em.\r\n\r\n\"Ahftah a bit I find we bound fo' N'Orleans. 'Fore we got dere, a ship\r\nhove 'longside an' gin us a message to put about. I ahsk a li'l\r\nIrishman, named Jack, wha we gwine, an' he say, 'Outa de worl'.'\r\n\r\n\"Jesus wep't I say, 'my mammy think I be daid.' I couldn't read nor\r\nwrite, an' didn't know how to tell noboddy how to back a letter to my\r\nmammy, so I jes' let hit go, an' we staht back de way we come.\r\n\r\n\"I thought hit be'n stormin' all de time, but w'en we pahs thoo de\r\nFlorida straits I see w'at a real storm's like. I didn't know, ontell\r\nwe was hahf way down de South American coast, headin fer Cape Horn, dat\r\nwe done pahs Key West, but I couldn't got off if I'd wanted to, 'cause\r\nI'd done jined de navy.\r\n\r\n\"Hit seem lak months 'fore we roun' de Cape an' head back north on de\r\nPacific, an' hit seem lak a year 'fore we drop anchor in Hong Kong. Dey\r\ntell me de admiral was stationed dere an' de cap'n had to report to him.\r\nW'ile he was doin' dis, we gits shore leave.\r\n\r\n\"Wen Jack an' me gits on land, we couldn't onnerstan' a word, but we mek\r\nsigns, an' a tough-lookin' Chink motion fer us to foller him. We go down\r\na dark street an' turn thoo an alley, then into a big room lighted with\r\ncolored paper lanterns. On de flo' we see some folks sleepin' wit some\r\nli'l footstools 'longside 'em, an some of 'em was smokin' long-stemmed\r\npipes. I figger mebbe dey goin' put us to sleep an' knock us in de haid.\r\nI look back an' see de do' swingin' shut, slow like, so I run back an'\r\nstick my foot in hit and shove hit back open.\r\n\r\n\"Jack an me run back de same way we come. Pretty soon we find anotha\r\nsailor an' go wit him to a yaller man dat could speak English. He pin a\r\nli'l yaller flag on our shirts an' say hit de badge o' de Chinese\r\ngov'ment, an' we be safe, cause we b'long to de U.S. navy.\r\n\r\n\"We go out to see de sights, but nevah hear one mo' word o' English; so\r\nahftah a time we go back to de ship an' stay ontell we put to sea again.\r\n\r\n\"Nex' we sails fo' Panama. W'en we ties up dere, Jack an' me goes\r\nashore. Ah nevah befo' see such pretty high-yaller gals in all my life.\r\nLooks lak dey made o' marble, dey so puffick.\r\n\r\n\"Me an' Jack gits likkered up de fust thing, an' I done lose 'im. Dat\r\nworry me some, 'cause we need each otha. Wit' his haid an' my arms we\r\nmek one pretty good man. Dat lil Irishman was a fightin' fool. Weighed\r\nonly 90 pounds, but strong an' wiry. Co'se he git licked mos' do time,\r\nbut he allus ready fer anotha fight.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't lak for folks to call him Irish. 'He fodder was Irish and he\r\nmudder American,' he say; 'I be'n born aboard a Dutch brig in French\r\nwaters. Now you tell me what flag I b'longs undah.'\r\n\r\n\"Wen we gits back to de ship, de boys tells me some English sailors beat\r\nJack up in de sportin' house. Sumbuddy sing out 'Beat it--de marines\r\ncomin'!, an' dey all run for de ship an leff Jack dere.\r\n\r\n\"I don't ahsk no mo' questions; jes' start back on a run to find my\r\nbuddy. At dat time I weigh 180, an' was pretty husky fer my age. Bein'\r\nlikkered plenty, I nevah thought 'bout gittin' beat up mahse'f.\r\n\r\n\"W'en I gits back, dere was a big Limey stahndin' wid his arms crost de\r\ndo'. 'All dem in, stay in, an' all de outs stay out,' he say.\r\n\r\n\"Now I be'n trained to respec' white folks--what is white folks--ever\r\nsence I bawn; but w'en I think 'bout Jack in dere, hahf dead, mebbe, dat\r\nLimey don't look none too white to me. I take a runnin' staht an' but\r\n'im in de belly wid my haid.\r\n\r\n\"De nex' do' was locked, an' I bus' hit down. Dere was Jack, 'bout hahf\r\ndone f'. Blood all over de fla'. Ev'thing in de room busted up an'\r\ntipped over. I hauls 'im to a back do', but hit locked. I kick out a\r\nwinder, heaves 'im onto my shoulder, an' runs back to de ship.\r\n\r\n\"Wen we comes up, dere was de cap'm standin' at de rail. His blue eyes\r\nlook lak he love to kill us.\r\n\r\n\"'Fall in!' he says, an' we does. 'Go for'd,' he says, an' we goes.\r\n\r\n\"'Now' he says, wat's all dis about?'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' says Jack, 'I didn't staht no fight. I jes' goes into a\r\nsaloon, peaceful like, an' a damn Limey says, pointin' to a British\r\nflag on dere own ship, 'You see dat flag?'\r\n\r\n\"'Aye,' says Jack, 'an' still I don't see nuthin'.'\r\n\r\n\"'I be'n over de seven seas,' says de Limey, 'an' I see dat ol' flag\r\nmistress of all of 'em.'\r\n\r\n\"'You be'n around some,' says Jack, 'but I done a li'l sailin' mahse'f.\r\nFust place I went was to France. Grass look lak hit need rain,' (So he\r\ntells dat Limey what he done fo' hit).\r\n\r\n\"'Nex' I goes to Germany,' he says; 'ground no good; need fer'lizer.'\r\n(So he tells 'im what he done on German soil).\r\n\r\n\"Atter dat I ships fo' England,' Jack tells de Limey, lookin' 'im\r\nstraight in de eye. 'Fust thing I see w'en we land is dat British flag\r\nw'at you be'n braggin' so loud about.' (So he tells dat Limey w'at 'e\r\nused de flag fer).\r\n\r\n\"'Fore God, Cap'm,' says Jack, 'dat Limey lan' on me wid bofe feet 'fore\r\nI say anotha word. Nevah got in one lick. Fack is, Cap'm I ain't be'n\r\ndoin' _no fightin'_ sence I done lef' dis here ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Go below,' says de cap'm 'an' clean yo'se'f up. Dis de lahst time you\r\ntwo gwine git shore leave on dis trip.' He try to look mad, but I see he\r\nwantin' to lahf.\r\n\r\n\"De nex' day,\" Uncle Dave finished, with a whimsical smile, \"I see de\r\nbos'n readin' in de paper 'bout de war 'twixt America an' England. Hit\r\nwas 'bout our li'l war--what _dey_ stahted an' _we_ finished.\"\r\n\r\nThe dusky old veteran of many battles unwrapped the small piece of black\r\ntobacco in the soiled handkerchief, decided on conservation, and slowly\r\nwrapped it up again.\r\n\r\n\"Nex' comes orders from de admiral in Hong Kong to sail fer Rio\r\nJaneiro. W'en we drop anchor, dere was some o' da meanes' lookin' wharf\r\nrats I evah see. Killers, dey was, willin' to knock anybody off, any\r\ntime, fer a few cents. We lines up fer shore leave, but dey mek Jack an'\r\nme stay on de ship. Our rucus in Panama done got us in bad wid de cap'm.\r\nBut Ah reckon hit was fer de bes'. One of our men come back wid a year\r\ncut off an' a busted nose. 'Nother one neveh come back at all.\r\n\r\n\"One mornin' I see 'em runnin' up a long pennant an' all de sailors lahf\r\nan dahnce about lak dey crazy. Hit was de signal 'omeward boun'. We\r\nweigh anchor and head fer N'York.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Taylor,' da officer say, when he pay me off 'you gwine ship wid\r\nus again?'\r\n\r\n\"'I gotta go home,' I tells 'im; 'got a job t' finish up in Key West.'\r\n\r\n\"So dey gin me my discharge an' a Gov'ment pahs on de Mallory liner\r\n_Clyde_. W'en I gits to Key West, fust place I goes was to dat fish\r\nmahket w'ere my mammy done sent me three year an' six months befo'. I\r\nbuy fifteen cents wuth o' fish an' go on home.\r\n\r\n\"W'en I git dere, dey was jes' settin' down to dinner. 'Wait,' Ah say,\r\n'put on one mo' plate.'\r\n\r\n\"My mammy look at me lak she done see a ghost. Den she run an' 'gin\r\nbeatin' on me.\r\n\r\n\"'Hol' on,' Ah tells 'er, 'you ain't forgot dat beatin' yit? I done got\r\nyo' fish,' an' I gin 'er de pahcel.\r\n\r\n\"'Mah boy, mah boy,' she say, 'Ah beatin' on yuh kase Ah so proud t' see\r\nyuh. Heah Ah done wear black fer yuh, an' gin yuh up fer daid; an' bress\r\nde Lawd, heah you is, lak come beck f'm de grave.'\r\n\r\n\"Ah retch down, in m' pocket an' pull a pahcel an' lay hit in her han';\r\nthree hunnert sebenty-eight dollahs, all de money I done made wid de\r\nGov'ment sence Ah left, an' I gin hit all to 'er. She lak t' had a fit;\r\nan Ah she' was de head man o' dat fembly whilst Ah stayed.\r\n\r\n\"But de salt water stick to me--Ah couldn't stay ashore. So ahftah Ah\r\nvisit wid 'em a spell, Ah goes down to de docks an' sign t' ship on a\r\nfo'-mahster tramp. Dat ol' tub tek me all ovah de worl'.\"\r\n\r\nPressed for details of some of his physical encounters on this second\r\nvoyage, Uncle Dave seemed in deep thought, and finally said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ah tell you 'bout de time I fout de bully of de ship. We was\r\nstill in Key West, waitin' fer wind. Dis ol' tramp ship, she got a crew\r\npicked up f'm all ovah de worl'. Dere ain't no sich thing as a color\r\nline dere. At mess time, white an' black all git in de same line. As dey\r\npahs by de table, each one take a knife an' cut off a piece o' meat.\r\n\r\n\"Dere was a big, high-yeller Haiti higgah, what thought he done own de\r\nship. 'Trouble wiz 'Merican niggahs,' he say, 'dey ain't got no sperrit.\r\nI be offisaire een my own countree--I don't bow ze knee to nobody, white\r\nor black.\"\r\n\r\n\"So when dey line up, dis here Haitian come crowdin' in ahead o' de fust\r\nman in de line, an' he cut off de bes' lean meat 'fore we gits ours.\r\n\r\n\"What's dis,' Ah say to de man ahead o' me, 'huccome dat white man don't\r\nbus' dat damn yeller swab wide open?'\r\n\r\n\"'Dat's Rousseau,' 'e says; 'Ain't nobuddy on dis ship big enough to put\r\n'im on de tail end o' de line.'\r\n\r\n\"I size 'im up good w'ile we eats. He weigh 196, dey tells me, an'\r\nnobuddy be'n lucky 'nuff to lay 'im out. 'Cordin' t' ship rules, dey\r\ncouldn't gang up on 'im. Cap'm mek ev'ybuddy fight single. Wan't no sich\r\nthing ez quarrelin'. Effen two sailors gits in a rucus, day pipe 'em up\r\non de main deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do what?\" the reporter asked.\r\n\r\n\"Pipe 'em up--de bos'n blow a whistle an' call 'em in t' fight it out,\r\nw'ile de othas watch de fun. Den day gotta shake han's, an' hit done\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ah see dis here Haiti niggah be a li'l bigger'n me, but Ah figger\r\nI gwine gin 'im a chajnce to staht sump'n de nex' time. So atter I takes\r\na couple o' drinks, I goes down early an' gits fust in de line. Sho'\r\n'nuff, Rousseau comes up an' crowds in ahead o' me. Ah pushes him to one\r\nside, an' gits ahead o' him. He raises his eyebrows, sorta\r\nsuprised-like, an' gits ahead o' me. I be fixin' to knock 'im clean ovah\r\nde rail, but by dat time, de Cap'm had 'is eye on us.\r\n\r\n\"'Pee-e-e-e-p,' go de whistle; 'Tay-lor-r-r-r' de bos'n sing out.\r\n\r\n\"'Taylor,\" I ahnswer.\r\n\r\n\"'Come to de mahst.'\r\n\r\n\"I tells 'em how it was, how I fixin' to knock dat niggah so far into de\r\nGulf we be thoo eatin' 'fore he kin swim back.\r\n\r\n\"'Pipe 'im up, bos'n,' says de cap'm.\r\n\r\n\"Rousseau comes in, and de whole crew wid 'im, t' see de fight. 'Pull\r\noff yer shirts,' says de cap'm, an' we done it. 'Wait,' says de bos'n;\r\n'de deck jes' be'n swabbed down--why bloody hit up, Cap'm? How 'bout\r\nlettin' 'em fight on shore?'\r\n\r\n\"Day was a flatform 'side a buildin' nex' to de water. Dey all line de\r\nrail an' let us go ashore t' scrap hit out. Boy, dat _was_ some fight;\r\nWe fout ontell we was lak two game roosters--both tired out, but still\r\nwantin' t' keep goin'. We jes' stan' dere, han's on each otha's\r\nshoulders, lookin' into each otha's eyes, blood runnin' down to our\r\ntoes. Pretty soon he back off an' try to rush me. I side steps, an' gits\r\nin a lucky lick below de heart. He draps to his knees, an' rolls ovah\r\non his back, wallin' his eyes lak he dyin'.\r\n\r\n\"Dey lay 'im on de deck an' souse 'im wid a bucket o' water, but he\r\nsleeps right on. De res' go back to de mess line, all but me--I wan't\r\nhongry. De nex' day I gits in line early, but dey wan't no Haiti niggah\r\nt' muscle in ahead o' me. He kep' to his bunk mighty nigh a week.\"\r\n\r\nJudging from the appearance of this feeble old man, one would hardly\r\nthink that he was once a rollicking scrapper, with ready fists like\r\nrawhide mallets. Old Dave dutifully gives full credit to the law of\r\nheredity.\r\n\r\n\"M' daddy was six feet six, an' weighed 248 pounds,\" he said proudly.\r\n\"Nevah done a hahd day's wuk in 'is life.\"\r\n\r\nWhen pressed for an explanation of this seeming phenomenon, the old man\r\nsniffed disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\"Does stock breeders wit a $10,000-stallion put 'im on de plow?... Dey\r\ncalled my daddy de $10,000 niggah.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Dave sat, stroking his cane for a few minutes, then smiled\r\nfaintly. \"My mammy was mighty nigh as big, an' nevah seen a sick day in\r\nher life. Wit a staht lak dat, hit ain't no wonder I growed up all\r\nbackbone an' muscle.\"\r\n\r\nWhile there have been many instances of atrocious cruelty to slaves,\r\nUncle Dave believes that other cases have been unduly magnified. He says\r\nthat he was never whipped by his master, but remembers numerous\r\nchastisements at the hands of Miss Jessie, his young owner, daughter of\r\nPierre Pinckney.\r\n\r\n\"De young missus used to beat me a right smaht,\" he recalled with an\r\namused smile. \"I b'longed to her, y'see. She was a couple o' years\r\nyounger'n me. I mind I used to be hangin' 'round de kitchen, watchin 'em\r\ncook cakes an' otha good things. W'en dey be done, I'd beg for one, an'\r\ndey take 'em off in de otha room, so's I couldn't steal any.\r\n\r\n\"Soon as de young missus be gone, I go an' kick ovah her playhouse an'\r\nupset her toys. When she come back, she be hoppin' mad, an staht beatin'\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"'Jessie,' her ma'd say, 'you'll kill Buddy, beatin' him dat way.'\r\n\r\n\"'I don't care,' she say, 'I'll beat him to death, an' git me a bettah\r\none.'\r\n\r\n\"I'd roll on de flo' an' holler loud, an' preten' she hurt me pow'ful\r\nbad. By'm by, when she git ovah her mad spell, she go off in da otha\r\nroom an' come back sid some o' dem good things fo' me.\" The old man's\r\neyes twinkled. \"Dat be w'at I'se atter all de time,\" he explained.\r\n\r\nThe perils of a life at sea are not as great as fiction writers\r\nsometimes indicate, according to this old sea dog. He says that in all\r\nhis voyages, he has been in only one serious wreck. That was on a reef\r\nof coral keys off the Bahamas.\r\n\r\n\"Day say dey ain't no wind so bad but what it blows some good to\r\nsomebuddy,\" observed the old man. \"Dat same wind what land us on de\r\nrocks done blow me to de bes' woman in de worl'. Ah reckon.\"\r\n\r\nHe chewed slowly, as he gazed out over the dingy housetops toward the\r\nmass of feathery clouds, which must have been floating over the rocky\r\nshoals off Nassau.\r\n\r\n\"She was de daughter o' de wreckin' mahater, a Nassau niggah by de name\r\no' Aleck Gator. W'en de crew done got us off de shoal and was towin' de\r\nwreck in, dere she was, stahndin' on de dock, waitin' fer her daddy.\r\nBig, overgrown gal, black an' devilish-lookin', noways handsome; but\r\nsomehow I jes' couldn't keep my eyes offen her.

'Fore I knowed it, we was talkin' 'bout wha' we gwine live ...\r\nFifty-one years is a mighty long time to stick to one woman, 'specially\r\nw'en you be'n lookin' over so many 'fore makin' up yo' mind ... Dis is\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Dave extended a tinted photograph. His gnarled fingers trembled as\r\nhe handed it over, and there was a suspicious softness in the lines of\r\nhis wrinkled old face, as he looked fondly at the likeness of the\r\nstolid, dark features.\r\n\r\n\"Hit be'n mighty lonesome since she done lef' dis worl' fo' year ago,\"\r\nhe said with feeling, as he carefully wrapped up the picture and put it\r\naway.\r\n\r\nUncle Dave has definite ideas of his own regarding domestic economy.\r\n\"Trouble wid young folks nowadays is dey don't have no good\r\nunnerstahndin' 'fore dey gits married. 'Fore we ever faces de preacher,\r\nI tells her she ain't gittin' no model man fer a husban'. I lake my\r\nlikker, an' I gwine have it w'en I wants it.\r\n\r\n\"'Now lissen,' I tells 'er, 'effen I comes home drunk, don't you go t'\r\nbressin' ee[TR:?] out.

F'm dat day on, we nevah had no mo' trouble 'bout de\r\nlikker question.\"\r\n\r\nThe weight of years has at last cooled the hot blood, but a hint of\r\ndeparted swashbuckling days still glistens in the old eyes as he sits\r\non his narrow porch and recalls scenes of the old days.\r\n\r\nTo one interested in the psychology of the Southern negro, this\r\nshriveled old man, with his half-bantering, half-pathetic attitude\r\noffers an interesting study. Borrowed from a page of history, he seems a\r\ncuriosity, like a fossil magically restored to life, endowed with the\r\npower of speech, telling of events so deeply buried in the past that\r\nthey seem almost unreal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nPearl Randolph, Field Worker\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nNovember 35, 1936\r\n\r\nACIE THOMAS\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas was at home today. There are many days when one might pass\r\nand repass the shabby lean-to that is his home without seeing any signs\r\nof life. That is because he spends much of his time foraging about the\r\nstreets of Jacksonville for whatever he can get in the way of food or\r\nold clothes, and perhaps a little money.\r\n\r\nHe is a heavily bearded, bent old man and a familiar figure in the\r\nresidential sections of the city, where he earns or begs a very meager\r\nlivelihood. Many know his story and marvel at his ability to relate\r\nincidents that must have occured when he was quite small.\r\n\r\nBorn in Jefferson County, Florida on July 26, 1857, he was one of the\r\n150 slaves belonging to the Folsom brothers, Tom and Bryant. His\r\nparents, Thomas and Mary, and their parents as far as they could\r\nremember, were all a part of the Folsom estate. The Folsoms never sold a\r\nslave except he merited this dire punishment in some way.\r\n\r\nAcie heard vague rumors of the cruelties of some slave owners, but it\r\nwas unknown among the Folsoms. He thinks this was due to the fact that\r\ncertain \"po white trash\" in the vicinity of their plantation owned\r\nslaves. It was the habit of the Folsoms to buy out these people whenever\r\nthey could do so by fair means or foul, according to his statements. And\r\nby and by there were no poor whites living near them. It was, he further\r\nstated like \"damning a nigger's soul, if Marse Tom or Marse Bryant\r\nthreatened to sell him to some po' white trash. And it allus brung good\r\nresults--better than tearing the hide off'n him woulda done.\"\r\n\r\nAs a child Acie spent much of his time roaming over the broad acres of\r\nthe Folsom plantation with other slave children. They waded in the\r\nstreams, fished, chased rabbits and always knew where the choicest wild\r\nberries and nuts grew. He knew all the wood lore common to children of\r\nhis time. This he learned mostly from \"cousin Ed\" who was several years\r\nolder than he and quite willing to enlighten a small boy in these\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nHe was taught that hooting owls were very jealous of their night hours\r\nand whenever they hooted near a field of workers they were saying: \"Task\r\ndone or no done--night's my time--go home!\" Whippoorwills flitted about\r\nthe woods in cotton picking time chattering about Jack marrying a widow.\r\nHe could not remember the story that goes with this. Oppossums were a\r\n\"sham faced\" tribe who \"sometimes wandered onto the wrong side of the\r\nday and got caught.\" They never overcame this shame as long as they were\r\nin captivity.\r\n\r\nAll bull rushes and tree stumps were to be carefully searched. One\r\nmight find his baby brother there at any time.\r\n\r\nWhen Acie \"got up some size\" he was required to do small tasks, but the\r\nmaster was not very exacting. There were the important tasks of\r\nferreting out the nests of stray hens, turkeys, guineas and geese. These\r\nnests were robbed to prevent the fowls from hatching too far from the\r\nhen house. Quite a number of these eggs got roasted in remote corners of\r\nthe plantation by the finders, who built fires and wrapped the eggs in\r\nwet rags and covered them with ashes. When they were done a loud pop\r\nannounced that fact to the roaster. Potatoes were cooked in the same\r\nmanner and often without the rags. Consequently these two tasks were\r\nnever neglected by the slave children. Cotton picking was not a bad job\r\neither--at least to the young.\r\n\r\nThen there was the ride to the cotton house at the end of the day atop\r\nthe baskets and coarse burlap sheets filled with the day's pickings.\r\nAcie's fondest ambition was to learn to manipulate the scales that told\r\nhim who had done a good day's work and who had not. His cousin Ed did\r\nthis envied task whenever the overseer could not find the time.\r\n\r\nMany other things were grown here. Corn for the cattle and \"roasting\r\nears,\" peanuts, tobacco and sugar cane. The cane was ground on the\r\nplantation and converted into barrels of syrup and brown sugar. The cane\r\ngrinding season was always a gala one. There was always plenty of juice,\r\nwith the skimmings and fresh syrup for all. Other industries were the\r\nblacksmith shop where horses and slaves were shod. The smoke houses\r\nwhere scores of hogs and cows were prepared and hung for future use. The\r\nsewing was presided over by the mistress. Clothing were made during the\r\nsummer and stored away for the cool winters. Young slave girls were kept\r\nbusy at knitting cotton and woolen stockings. Candles were made in the\r\n\"big house\" kitchen and only for consumption by the household of the\r\nmaster. Slaves used fat lightwood knots or their open fireplaces for\r\nlighting purposes.\r\n\r\nThere was always plenty of everything to eat for the slaves. They had\r\nwhite bread that had been made on the place. Corn meal, rice, potatoes,\r\nsyrup vegetables and home-cured meat. Food was cooked in iron pots hung\r\nover the fireplace by rings made of the same metal. Bread and pastries\r\nwere made in the \"skillet\" and \"spider.\"\r\n\r\nMuch work was needed to supply the demands of so large a plantation but\r\nthe slaves were often given time off for frolics (dances),\r\n(quilting-weddings). These gatherings were attended by old and young\r\nfrom neighboring plantations. There was always plenty of food, masters\r\nvying with another for the honor of giving his slaves the finest\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nThere was dancing and music. On the Folsom plantation Bryant, the\r\nyoungest of the masters furnished the music. He played the fiddle and\r\nliked to see the slaves dance \"cutting the pigeon wing.\"\r\n\r\nMany matches were made at these affairs. The women came \"all rigged out\r\nin their best\" which was not bad at all, as the mistresses often gave\r\nthem their cast off clothes. Some of these were very fine indeed with\r\ntheir frills and hoops and many petticoats. Those who had no finery\r\ncontented themselves with scenting their hair and bodies with sweet\r\nherbs, which they also chewed. Quite often they were rewarded by the\r\nattention of some swain from a distant plantation. In this case it was\r\nnecessary for their respective owners to consent to a union. Slaves on\r\nthe Folsom plantation were always married properly and quite often had a\r\n\"sizeable\" wedding, the master and mistress often came and made merry\r\nwith their slaves.\r\n\r\nAcie knew about the war because he was one of the slaves commandeered by\r\nthe Confederate army for hauling food and ammunition to different points\r\nbetween Tallahassee and a city in Virginia that he is unable to\r\nremember. It was a common occurrence for the soldiers to visit the\r\nplantation owners and command a certain number of horses and slaves for\r\nservices such as Acie did.\r\n\r\nHe thinks that he might have been about 15 years old when he was freed.\r\nA soldier in blue came to the plantation and brought a \"document\" that\r\nTom, their master read to all the slaves who had been summoned to the\r\n\"big house\" for that purpose. About half of them consented to remain\r\nwith him. The others went away, glad of their new freedom. Few had made\r\nany plans and were content to wander about the country, living as they\r\ncould. Some were more sober minded, and Acie's father was among the\r\nlatter. He remained on the Folsom place for a short while; he then\r\nsettled down to share-croping in Jefferson County. Their first year was\r\nthe hardest, because of the many adjustments that had to be made. Then\r\nthings became better. By means of hard work and the co-operation of\r\nfriendly whites the slaves in the section soon learned to shift for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nNortherners came South \"in swarms\" and opened schools for the ex-slaves,\r\nbut Acie was not fortunate enough to get very far in his \"blue back\r\nWebster.\" There was too much work to be done and his father trying to\r\nbuy the land. Nor did he take an interest in the political meetings held\r\nin the neighborhood. His parents shared with him the common belief that\r\nsuch things were not to be shared by the humble. Some believed that \"too\r\nmuch book learning made the brain weak.\"\r\n\r\nAcie met and married Keziah Wright, who was the daughter of a woman his\r\nmother had known in slavery. Strangely enough they had never met as\r\nchildren. With his wife he remained in Jefferson County, where nine of\r\ntheir thirteen children were born.\r\n\r\nWith his family he moved to Jacksonville and had been living here \"a\r\nright good while\" when the fire occurred in 1903. He was employed as a\r\ncity laborer and helped to build street car lines and pave streets. He\r\nalso helped with the installation of electric wiring in many parts of\r\nthe city. He was injured while working for the City of Jacksonville, but\r\nclaims that he was never in any manner remunerated for this injury.\r\n\r\nAcie worked hard and accumulated land in the Moncrief section and lives\r\nwithin a few feet of the spot where his house burned many years ago. He\r\nwas very sad as he pointed out this spot to his visitor. A few scraggly\r\nhedges and an apple tree, a charred bit of fence, a chimney foundation\r\nare the only markers of the home he built after years of a hard struggle\r\nto have a home. His land is all gone except the scant five acres upon\r\nwhich he lives, and this is only an expanse of broom straw. He is no\r\nlonger able to cultivate the land, not even having a kitchen garden.\r\n\r\nKaziah, the wife, died several years ago; likewise all the children,\r\nexcept two. One of these, a girl, is \"somewhere up Nawth\". The son has\r\nvisited him twice in five years and seems never to have anything to give\r\nthe old man, who expresses himself as desiring much to \"quit die\r\nunfriendly world\" since he has nothing to live for except a lot of dead\r\nmemories.\r\n\r\n\"All done left me now. Everything I got done gone--all 'cept Keziah. She\r\ncomes and visits me and we talk and walk over there where we uster and\r\nset on the porch. She low she gwine steal ole Acie some of dese days in\r\nthe near future, and I'll be mighty glad to go ever yonder where all I\r\ngot is at.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1. Personal interview with Acie Thomas, Moncrief Road Jacksonville,\r\nFlorida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nMartin Richardson, Field Worker\r\nSouth Jacksonville, Florida\r\nDecember 8, 1936\r\n\r\nSHACK THOMAS, Centenarian\r\n\r\n\r\nBeady-eyed, grey-whiskered, black little Shack Thomas sits in the sun in\r\nfront of his hut on the Old Saint Augustine Road about three miles south\r\nof Jacksonville, 102 years old and full of humorous reminiscences about\r\nmost of those years. To his frequent visitors he relates tales of his\r\npast, disjointedly sometimes but with a remarkable clearness and\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nThe old ex-slave does not remember the exact time of his birth, except\r\nthat it was in the year 1834, \"the day after the end of the Indian War.\"\r\nHe does not recall which of the Indian wars, but says that it was while\r\nthere were still many Indians in West Florida who were very hard for him\r\nto understand when he got big enough to talk, to them.\r\n\r\nHe was born, he says on \"a great big place that b'longed to Mister Jim\r\nCampbell; I don't know just exactly how big, but there was a lot of us\r\nworking on it when I was a little fellow.\" The place was evidently one\r\nof the plantations near Tallahassee; Thomas remembers that as soon as he\r\nwas large enough he helped his parents and others raise \"corn, peanuts,\r\na little bit of cotton and potatoes. Squash just grew wild in the\r\nwoods; we used to eat them when we couldn't get anything else much.\"\r\n\r\nThe centennarian remembers his parents clearly; his mother was one Nancy\r\nand his father's name was Adam. His father, he says, used to spend hours\r\nafter the candles were out telling him and his brothers about his\r\ncapture and subsequent slavery.\r\n\r\nAdam was a native of the West Coast of Africa, and when quite a young\r\nman was attracted one day to a large ship that had just come near his\r\nhome. With many others he was attracted aboard by bright red\r\nhandkerchiefs, shawls and other articles in the hands of the seamen.\r\nShortly afterwards he was securely bound in the hold of the ship, to be\r\nlater sold somewhere in America. Thomas does not know exactly where Adam\r\nlanded, but knows that his father had been in Florida many years before\r\nhis birth. \"I guess that's why I can't stand red things now,\" he says;\r\n\"my pa hated the sight of it.\"\r\n\r\nThomas spent all of his enslaved years on the Campbell plantation, where\r\nhe describes pre-emancipation conditions as better than \"he used to hear\r\nthey was on the other places.\" Campbell himself is described as\r\nmoderate, if not actually kindly. He did not permit his slaves to be\r\nbeaten to any great extent. \"The most he would give us was a\r\n'switching', and most of the time we could pray out of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But sometimes he would get a hard man working for him, though,\" the old\r\nman continues. \"One of them used to 'buck and gag' us.\" This he\r\ndescribes as a punishment used particularly with runaways, where the\r\nslave would be gagged and tied in a squatting position and left in the\r\nsun for hours. He claims to have seen other slaves suspended by their\r\nthumbs for varying periods; he repeats, though, that these were not\r\nCampbell's practices.\r\n\r\nDuring the years before \"surrinder\", Thomas saw much traffic in slaves,\r\nhe says. Each year around New Years, itinerant \"speculators\" would come\r\nto his vicinity and either hold a public sale, or lead the slaves, tied\r\ntogether, to the plantation for inspection or sale.\r\n\r\n\"A whole lot of times they wouldn't sell 'em, they'd just trade 'em like\r\nthey did horses. The man (plantation owner) would have a couple of old\r\nwomen who couldn't do much any more, and he'd swap 'em to the other man\r\nfor a young 'un. I seen lots of 'em traded that way, and sold for money\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nThomas recalls at least one Indian family that lived in his neighborhood\r\nuntil he left it after the War. This family, he says, did not work, but\r\nhad a little place of their own. \"They didn't have much to do with\r\nnobody, though,\" he adds.\r\n\r\nOthers of his neighbors during these early years were abolition-minded\r\nwhite residents of the area. These, he says would take in runaway slaves\r\nand \"either work 'em or hide 'em until they could try to get North.\"\r\nWhen they'd get caught at it, though, they'd \"take 'em to town and beat\r\n'em like they would us, then take their places and run 'em out.\"\r\n\r\nLater he came to know the \"pu-trols\" and the \"refugees.\" Of the former,\r\nhe has only to say that they gave him a lot of trouble every time he\r\ndidn't have a pass to leave--\"they only give me one twice a week,\"--and\r\nof the latter that it was they who induced the slaves of Campbell to\r\nremain and finish their crop after the Emancipation, receiving\r\none-fourth of it for their share. He states that Campbell exceeded this\r\namount in the division later.\r\n\r\nAfter 'surrinder' Thomas and his relatives remained on the Campbell\r\nplace, working for $5 a month, payable at each Christmas. He recalls how\r\nrich he felt with this money, as compared with the other free Negroes in\r\nthe section. All of the children and his mother were paid this amount,\r\nhe states.\r\n\r\nThe old man remembers very clearly the customs that prevailed both\r\nbefore and after his freedom. On the plantation, he says, they never\r\nfaced actual want of food, although his meals were plain. He ate mostly\r\ncorn meal and bacon, and squash and potatoes, he adds \"and every now and\r\nthen we'd eat more than that.\" He doesn't recall exactly what, but says\r\nit was \"Oh, lots of greens and cabbage and syrul, and sometimes plenty\r\nof meat too.\"\r\n\r\nHis mother and the other women were given white cotton--he thinks it may\r\nhave been duck--dresses \"every now and then\", he states, but none of the\r\nwomen really had to confine themselves to white, \"cause they'd dye 'em\r\nas soon as they'd get 'em.\" For dye, he says they would boil wild\r\nindigo, poke berries, walnuts and some tree for which he has an\r\nundecipherable name.\r\n\r\nCampbell's slaves did not have to go barefoot--not during the colder\r\nmonths, anyway. As soon as winter would come, each one of them was given\r\na pair of bright, untanned leather \"brogans,\" that would be the envy of\r\nthe vicinity. Soap for the slaves was made by the women of the\r\nplantation; by burning cockle-burrs, blackjack wood and other materials,\r\nthen adding the accumulated fat of the past few weeks. For light they\r\nwere given tallow candles. Asked if there was any certain time to put\r\nthe candles out at night, Thomas answers that \"Mr. Campbell didn't care\r\nhow late you stayed up at night, just so you was ready to work at\r\ndaybreak.\"\r\n\r\nThe ex-slave doesn't remember any feathers in the covering for his\r\npallet in the corner of his cabin, but says that Mr. Campbell always\r\nprovided the slaves with blankets and the women with quilts.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was given his freedom, Thomas had learned several trades\r\nin addition to farming; one of them was carpentry. When he eventually\r\nleft his $5 a month job with his master, he began travelling over the\r\nstate, a practice he has not discontinued until the present. He worked,\r\nhe says, \"in such towns as Perry, Sarasota, Clearwater and every town in\r\nFlorida down to where the ocean goes under the bridge.\" (Probably Key\r\nWest.)\r\n\r\nHe came to Jacksonville about what he believes to be half a century ago.\r\nHe remembers that it was \"ever so long before the fire\" (1901) and \"way\r\nback there when there wasn't but three families over here in South\r\nJacksonville: the Sahds, the Hendricks and the Oaks. I worked for all of\r\nthem, but I worked for Mr. Bowden the longest.\"\r\n\r\nThe reference is to R.L. Bowden, whom Thomas claims as one of his first\r\nemployers in this section.\r\n\r\nThe old man has 22 children, the eldest of those living, looking older\r\nthan Thomas himself. This \"child\" is fifty-odd years. He has been\r\nmarried three times, and lives now with his 50 year old wife.\r\n\r\nIn front of his shack is a huge, spreading oak tree. He says that there\r\nwere three of them that he and his wife tended when they first moved to\r\nJacksonville. \"That one there was so little that I used to trim it with\r\nmy pocket-knife,\" he states. The tree he mentioned is now about\r\ntwo-and-a-half feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"Right after my first wife died, one of them trees withered,\" the old\r\nman tells you. \"I did all I could to save the other one, but pretty soon\r\nit was gone too. I guess this other one is waiting for me,\" he laughs,\r\nand points to the remaining oak.\r\n\r\nThomas protests that his health is excellent, except for \"just a little\r\nhaze that comes over my eyes, and I can't see so good.\" He claims that\r\nhe has no physical aches and pains. Despite the more than a century his\r\nvoice is lively and his hearing fair, and his desire for travel still\r\nvery much alive. When interviewed he had just completed a trip to a\r\ndaughter in Clearwater, and \"would have gone farther than that, but my\r\nson wouldn't send me no fare like he promised!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1. Interview with subject, Shack Thomas, living on Old Saint Augustine\r\nRoad, South Jacksonville, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nRachel A. Austin\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nNovember 30, 1936\r\n\r\nLUKE TOWNS, A Centenarian\r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Towns, a centenarian, now residing at 1335 West Eighth Street,\r\nJacksonville, Florida, was the ninth child born to Maria and Like Towns,\r\nslaves, December 34, 1835, in a village in Tolberton County, Georgia.\r\n\r\nMr. Town's parents were owned by Governor Towns, whose name was taken by\r\nall the children born on the plantation; he states that he was placed on\r\nthe public blocks for sale, and was purchased by a Mr. Mormon. At the\r\nmarriage of Mr. Mormon's daughter, Sarah, according to custom, he was\r\ngiven to this daughter as a wedding present, and thus became the slave\r\nand took the name of the Gulleys and lived with them until he became a\r\nyoung man at Smithville, Georgia, in Lee County.\r\n\r\nHis chief work was that of carrying water, wood and working around the\r\nhouse when a youngster; often, he states he would hide in the woods to\r\nkeep from working.\r\n\r\nBecause his mother was a child-bearing woman, she did not know the hard\r\nlabors of slavery, but had a small patch of cotton and a garden near the\r\nhouse to care for. \"All of the others worked hard,\" said he \"but had\r\nkind masters who fed them well.\" When asked if his mother were a\r\nchristian, he replied \"why yes: indeed she was, and believed in prayer;\r\none day as she traveled from her patch home, just as she was about to\r\nlet the 'gap' (this was a fence built to keep the hogs and horses shut\r\nin) down, she knelt to pray and a light appeared before her and from\r\nthat time on she did not believe in any fogyism, but in God.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot remember much now,\" he says, \"of what happened in slavery, but\r\nafter slavery we went back to the name of Towns. I know I got some\r\nwhippings and during the war my job was that of carrying the master's\r\nluggage.\" (1)\r\n\r\nAfter the war he went to Albany, Georgia and began working for himself,\r\nhauling salt from Albany to Tallahassee, Florida; this salt was sold to\r\nthe stores. His next job was that of sampling cotton.\r\n\r\nJust before he was 30 years old he was married to Mary Julia Coats, who\r\nlived near Albany, Georgia. To them were born the following children:\r\nWillie, George, Alexander, Henry Hillsman, Ella Louise, and\r\ntwins--Walter Luke and Mary Julia, who were named for the parents.\r\n\r\nHe was converted to the Baptist faith when his first child was born;\r\nthere were no churches, but services were held in the blacksmith shop on\r\nthe corner of Jackson and State Streets. Later he became a member of\r\nMount Zion Baptist Church Albany, Georgia, and served there for 50\r\nyears as a deacon.\r\n\r\nHe remained in Georgia until 1899 when he moved to Tampa, Florida and\r\nthere he operated a cafe. He joined Beulah Baptist Church and served as\r\ndeacon there until he sold his business and came to Jacksonville, 1917,\r\nto live with his youngest daughter, Mrs. Mary Houston, because he was\r\ntoo old to operate a business. In Jacksonville he connected himself with\r\nthe Bethel Baptist Church, and while too old to serve as an active\r\ndeacon, he was placed on the honorary list because of his previous\r\nrecord of church service.\r\n\r\nAs a relic of pre-freedom days, Mr. Towns has a piece of paper money and\r\na one-cent piece which he keeps securely looked in his trunk and allows\r\nno one to open the trunk; he keeps the key.\r\n\r\nMr. Towns, who will celebrate his one-hundred-first birthday, December\r\n24, 1936, is not able to coherently relate incidents of the past; he\r\nhears but little and that with great difficulty.\r\n\r\nHe says he has his second eyesight; he reads without the use of glasses;\r\nuntil very recently he has been very active in mind and body, having\r\nregistered in the Spring of 1936, signing his own name on the\r\nregistration books. He has almost all of his hair, which is thick,\r\nsilvery white and of artist length. He has most of his teeth, walks\r\nwithout a cane except when painful; dresses himself without assistance.\r\n\r\nMr. Towns rises at six o'clock each morning, often earlier. Makes his\r\nbed (he has never allowed anyone to make his bed for him) and because it\r\nis still dark has to lie across the bed to await the breaking of day.\r\nHis health is very good and his appetite strong.\r\n\r\nUpon the occasion of his one-hundredth birthday, December 24, 1935, his\r\ndaughter Mrs. Houston gave him a child's party and invited one hundred\r\nguest; one hundred stockings were made, filled with fruits, nuts and\r\ncandies and one given each guest. A huge cake with one hundred candles\r\nadorned the table and during the party, he cut the cake. At this party,\r\nhe showed all the joys and pleasures of a child. His other daughter Mrs.\r\nE.L. McMillan, of New York City, and son, Mr. George Towns, for years an\r\ninstructor in Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia, were present for the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nMr. Towns has been noted during his lifetime for having a remarkable\r\nmemory and has many times publicly delivered orations from many of\r\nShakespeare's works. His memory began failing him in 1936.\r\n\r\nHe is very well educated and now spends most of his time sitting on the\r\nporch reading the Bible. (2)\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1.

Muse\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nMarch 20, 1937\r\n\r\nWILLIS WILLIAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nWillis Williams of 1025 Iverson Street, Jacksonville, Florida, was born\r\nat Tallahassee, Florida, September 15, 1856. He was the son of Ransom\r\nand Wilhemina Williams, who belonged during the period of slavery to\r\nThomas Heyward, a rich merchant of Tallahassee. Willis does not know the\r\nnames of his paternal grandparents but remembers his maternal\r\ngrandmother was Rachel Fitzgiles, who came down to visit the family\r\nafter the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThomas Heyward, the master, owned a plantation out in the country from\r\nTallahassee and kept slaves out there; he also owned a fine home in the\r\ncity as well as a large grocery store and produce house.\r\n\r\nWillis' mother, Wilhemina, was the cook at the town house and his\r\nfather, Williams, did carpentry and other light work around the place.\r\nHe does not remember how his father learned the trade, but presumes that\r\nMr. Heyward put him under a white carpenter until he had learned. The\r\nfirst he remembers of his father was that he did carpentry work.\r\n\r\nAt the time Willis was born and during his early life, even rich people\r\nlike Mr. Heyward did not have cook stoves. They knew nothing of such.\r\nThe only means of cooking was by fireplace, which, as he remembers, was\r\nwide with an iron rod across it. To the rod a large iron pot was\r\nsuspended and in it food was cooked. An iron skillet with a lid was used\r\nfor baking and it also was used to cook meats and other food. The\r\ncommon name for the utensil was 'spider' and every home had one.\r\n\r\nWillis fared well during the first nine years of his life which were\r\nspent in slavery. To him it was the same as freedom for he was not a\r\nvictim of any unpleasant experiences as related by some other ex-slaves.\r\nHe played base ball and looked after his younger brothers and sister\r\nwhile his mother was in the kitchen. He was never flogged but received\r\nchastisement once from the father of Mr. Heyward. That, he related, was\r\nlight and not nearly so severe as many parents give their children\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nWilhemina, his mother, and the cook, saw to it that her children were\r\nwell fed. They were fed right from the master's table, so to speak. They\r\ndid not sit to the table with the master and his family, but ate the\r\nsame kind of food that was served them.\r\n\r\nCornbread was baked in the Heyward kitchen but biscuits also were baked\r\ntwice daily and the Negroes were allowed to eat as many as they wished.\r\nThe dishes were made of tin and the drinking vessels were made from\r\ngourds. Few white people had china dishes and when they did possess them\r\nthey were highly prized and great care was taken of them.\r\n\r\nThe few other slaves which Mr. Heyward kept around the town house tended\r\nthe garden and the many chickens, ducks and geese on the place. The\r\ngarden afforded all of the vegetables necessary for feeding Master\r\nHeyward, his family and slaves. He did not object to the slaves eating\r\nchicken and green vegetables and sent provisions of all kinds from his\r\nstore to boot.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Heyward was wealthy there were many things he could not buy\r\nfor Tallahassee did not afford them. Willis remembers that candles were\r\nmostly used for light. Home-made tallow was used in making them. The\r\nmoulds, which were made of wood, were of the correct size. Cotton string\r\ntwisted right from the raw cotton was cut into desired length and placed\r\nin the moulds first, then heated tallow was poured in until they were\r\nfilled. The tallow was allowed to set and cool, then they were removed,\r\nready for use.\r\n\r\nIn those days coffee was very expensive and a substitute for it was made\r\nfrom parched corn. The whites used it as well as the slaves.\r\n\r\nWillis remembers a man named Pierce who cured cow hides. He used to buy\r\nthem and one time Willis skinned a cow and took the hide to him and sold\r\nit. Sixty-five and seventy years ago everyone used horses or mules and\r\nthey had to have shoes. The blacksmith wore leather aprons and the\r\nhorses and mules wore leather collars. No one knew anything about\r\ncomposition leather for making shoes so the tanning of hides was a\r\nlucrative business.\r\n\r\nClothing, during Civil War days and early Reconstruction, was simple as\r\ncompared to present day togs. Cloth woven from homespun thread was the\r\nonly kind Negroes had. Every house of any note could boast of a spinning\r\nwheel and loom. Cotton, picked by slaves, was cleared of the seed and\r\nspun into thread and woven into cloth by them. It was common to know how\r\nto spin and weave. Some of the cloth was dyed afterwards with dye made\r\nfrom indigo and polk berries. Some was used in its natural color.\r\n\r\nCotton was the main product of most southern plantations and the owner\r\nusually depended upon the income from the sale of his yearly crop to\r\nmaintain his home and upkeep of his slaves and cattle. It was necessary\r\nfor every farm to yield as much as possible and much energy was directed\r\ntoward growing and picking large crops. Although Mr. Heyward was a\r\nsuccessful merchant, he did not lose sight of the fact that his country\r\nproperty could yield a bountiful supply of cotton, corn and tobacco.\r\n\r\nAround the town house Mr. Heyward maintained an atmosphere of home life.\r\nHe wanted his family and his servants well cared for and spared no\r\nexpense in making life happy.\r\n\r\nAs Willis remembers the beds were made of Florida moss and feathers.\r\nBoards ware laid across for slats and the mattress placed upon the\r\nboards. On top of the moss mattress a feather one was placed which made\r\nsleeping very comfortable. In summer the feather mattress was often\r\nremoved, sunned, aired and replaced in winter. Goose and the downy\r\nfeathers of chickens were saved and stored in large bags until enough\r\nwere collected for a mattress and it was considered a prize to possess\r\none.\r\n\r\nEvery family of note boasted the ownership of a horse and buggy or\r\nseveral of each. The kind most popular during Willis' boyhood was the\r\none-seated affair with a short wagon-like bed in the rear of the seat.\r\nSometimes two seats were used. The seats were removable and could be\r\nused for carrying baggage or other light weights. The brougham, surrey\r\nand landam were unknown to Willis.\r\n\r\nBefore the Civil War and during the time the great struggle was in full\r\nswing, women wore hoop skirts, very full, held out with metal hoops.\r\nPantaloons were worn beneath them and around the ankle where they were\r\ngathered very closely, a ruffle edged with a narrow lace, finished them\r\noff. The waist was tight fitting basque and sleeves which could be worn\r\nlong or to elbow, were very full. Women also wore their hair high up on\r\ntheir heads with frills around the face. Negro women, right after\r\nslavery, fell into imitating their former mistresses and many of them\r\nwho were fortunate enough to get employment used part of their earnings\r\nfor at least one good dress. It was usually made of woolen a yard wide,\r\nor silk.\r\n\r\nMoney has undergone a change as rapidly as some other commonplace\r\nthings. In Willis' early life, money valued at less than one dollar was\r\nmade of paper just as the dollar, five dollar or ten dollar bills were.\r\nThere was a difference however, in the paper representing 'change' and\r\nnot as much care was taken in protecting it from being imitated. The\r\npaper money used for change was called \"shin plasters\" and much of it\r\nflooded the southland during Civil War days.\r\n\r\nMr. Heyward did not enlist in the army to help protect the south's\r\ndemise but his eldest son, Charlie, went. His younger son was not old\r\nenough to go. Willis stated that Mr. Heyward did not go because he was\r\nin business and was needed at home to look after it. It is not known\r\nwhether Charlie was killed at war or not, but, Willis said he did not\r\nreturn home at the close of war.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of freedom came to Thomas Heyward's town slaves it was\r\nbrought by McCook's Cavalry. Willis remembers the uniforms worn by the\r\nnortherners was dark blue with brass buttons and the Confederates wore\r\ngray. After the cavalry reached Tallahassee, they separated into\r\nsections, each division taking a different part of the town. Negroes of\r\nthe household were called together and were informed of their freedom.\r\nIt is remembered by Willis that the slaves were jubilant but not\r\nboastful.\r\n\r\nMr. Heyward was dealt a hard blow during the war; his store was\r\nconfiscated and used as a commissary by the northern army. When the war\r\nended he was deprived of his slaves and a great portion of his former\r\nwealth vanished with their going.\r\n\r\nThe loss of his wealth and slaves did not bitter Mr. Heyward; to the\r\ncontrary, he was as kindhearted as in days past.\r\n\r\nMcCook's Cavalry did not remain in Tallahassee very long and was\r\nreplaced by a colored company; the 99th Infantry. Their duty was to\r\nmaintain order within the town. An orchestra was with the outfit and\r\nWillis remembers that they were very good musicians. A Negro who had\r\nbeen the slave of a man of Tallahassee was a member of the orchestra.\r\nHis name was Singleton and his former master invited the orchestra to\r\ncome to his house and play for the family. The Negroes were glad to\r\nrender service, went, and after that entertained many white families in\r\ntheir homes.\r\n\r\nThe southern soldiers who returned after the war appeared to receive\r\ntheir defeat as good 'sports' and not as much friction between the races\r\nexisted as would be imagined. The ex-slave, while he was glad to be\r\nfree, wanted to be sheltered under the 'wings' of his former master and\r\nmistress. In most cases they were hired by their former owners and peace\r\nreigned around the home or plantation. This was true of Tallahassee, if\r\nnot of other sections of the south.\r\n\r\nSoon after the smoke of the cannons had died down and people began\r\nthinking of the future, the Negroes turned their thoughts toward\r\neducation. They grasped every opportunity to learn to read and write.\r\nSchools were fostered by northern white capitalists and white women were\r\nsent into the southland to teach the colored boys and girls to read,\r\nwrite and figure. Any Negro who had been fortunate enough to gain some\r\nknowledge during slavery could get a position as school teacher. As a\r\nresult many poorly prepared persons entered the school room as tutor.\r\n\r\nWilliam Williams, Willis' father, found work at the old Florida Central\r\nand Peninsular Railroad yards and worked for many years there. He sent\r\nhis children to school and Willis advanced rapidly.\r\n\r\nDuring slavery Negroes attended church, sat in the balcony, and very\r\noften log churches were built for them. Meetings were held under \"bush\r\nharbors.\" After the war frame and log churches served them as places of\r\nworship. These buildings were erected by whites who came into the\r\nsouthland to help the ex-slave. Negro men who claimed God had called\r\nthem to preach served as ministers of most of the Negro churches but\r\noften white preachers visited them and instructed them concerning the\r\nBible and what God wanted them to do. Services were conducted three\r\ntimes a day on Sunday, morning at eleven, in afternoon about three and\r\nat night at eight o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe manner of worship was very much in keeping with present day modes.\r\nPreachers appealed to the emotions of the 'flock' and the congregation\r\nresponded with \"amens,\" \"halleluia,\" clapping of hands, shouting and\r\nscreaming. Willis remarked to one white man during his early life, that\r\nhe wondered why the people yelled so loudly and the man replied that in\r\nfifty years hence the Negroes would be educated, know better and would\r\nnot do that. He further replied that fifty years ago the white people\r\nscreamed and shouted that way. Willis wonders now when he sees both\r\nwhite and colored people responding to preaching in much the same way as\r\nin his early life if education has made much difference in many cases.\r\n\r\nMuch superstition and ignorance existed among the Negroes during slavery\r\nand early reconstruction. Some wore bags of sulphur saying they would\r\nkeep away disease. Some wore bags of salt and charcoal believing that\r\nevil spirits would be kept away from them. Others wore a silver coin in\r\ntheir shoes and some made holes in the coin, threaded a string through\r\nit, attached it to the ankle so that no one could conjure them. Some who\r\nthought an enemy might sprinkle \"goofer dust\" around their door steps\r\nswept very clean around the door step in the evening and allowed no one\r\nto come in afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Negro men who spent much time around the \"grannies\" during slavery\r\nlearned much about herbs and roots and how they were used to cure all\r\nmanner of ills, the doctor gave practically the same kind of medicine\r\nfor most ailments. The white doctors at that time had not been schooled\r\nto a great extent and carried medicine bags around to the sick room\r\nwhich contained pills and a very few other kinds of medicines which they\r\nhad made from herbs and roots. Some of them are used to-day but Willis\r\nsaid most of their medicines were pills.\r\n\r\nTen years after the Civil War Willis Williams had advanced in his\r\nstudies to the extent that he passed the government examination and\r\nbecame a railway mail clerk. He ran from Tallahassee to Palatka and\r\nRiver Junction on the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad. There was\r\nno other railroad going into Tallahassee then.\r\n\r\nThe first Negro railway mail clerk according to Willis' knowledge\r\nrunning from Tallahassee to Jacksonville, was Benjamin F. Cox. The first\r\ncolored mail clerk in the Jacksonville Post Office was Camp Hughes. He\r\nwas sent to prison for rifling the mail. Willis Myers succeeded Hughes\r\nand Willis Williams succeeded Myers. Willis received a telegram to come\r\nto Jacksonville to take Myers' place and when he came expected to stay\r\nthree or four days, but, after getting here was retained permanently and\r\nremained in the service until his retirement.\r\n\r\nHis first run from Tallahassee to Palatka and River Junction began in\r\n1875 and lasted until 1879. In 1879 he was called to Jacksonville to\r\nsucceed Myers and when he retired forty years later, had filled the\r\nposition creditably, therefore was retired on a pension which he will\r\nreceive until his death.\r\n\r\nWillis Williams is in good health, attends Ebenezer Methodist Episcopal\r\nChurch of which he is a member. He possesses all of his faculties and is\r\nable to carry on an intelligent conversation on his fifty years in\r\nJacksonville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\r\n\r\nJames Johnson, Field Worker\r\nLake City, Florida\r\nNovember 6, 1936\r\n\r\nCLAUDE AUGUSTA WILSON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1857 on the plantation of Tom Dexter in Lake City, Columbia County,\r\nFlorida, was born a Negro, Claude Augusta Wilson, of slave parents. His\r\nmaster Tom Dexter was very kind to his slaves, and was said to have been\r\na Yankee. His wife Mary Ann Dexter, a southerner, was the direct\r\nopposite, she was very mean. Claude was eight years old when\r\nEmancipation came.\r\n\r\nThe Dexter plantation was quite a large place, covering 100 or more\r\nacres. There were about 100 slaves, including children. They had regular\r\none room quarters built of logs which was quite insignificant in\r\ncomparison with the palatial Dexter mansion. The slaves would arise\r\nearly each morning, being awakened by a \"driver\" who was a white man,\r\nand by \"sun-up\" would be at their respective tasks in the fields. All\r\nday they worked, stopping at noon to get a bite to eat, which they\r\ncarried on the fields from their cabins.\r\n\r\nAt \"sun-down\" they would quit work and return to their cabins, prepare\r\ntheir meals and gossip from cabin to cabin. Finally retiring to await\r\nthe dawn of a new day which signalled a return to their routine duties.\r\nAt Sundays they would gather at a poorly constructed frame building\r\nwhich was known as the \"Meeting House,\" In this building they would give\r\npraise and thanks to their God. The rest of the day was spent in\r\nrelaxation as this was the only day of the week in which they were not\r\nforced to work.\r\n\r\nClaude Augusta worked in the fields, his mother and sister worked in the\r\nDexter mansion. Their duties were general house work, cooking and\r\nsewing. His Mother was very rebellious toward her duties and constantly\r\nharrassed the \"Missus\" about letting her work in the fields with her\r\nhusband until finally she was permitted to make the change from the\r\nhouse to the fields to be near her man.\r\n\r\nThe \"missus\" taught Claude's sister to sew and to the present day most\r\nof her female descendants have some ability in dress making.\r\n\r\nThe mansion was furnished with the latest furniture of the tine, but the\r\nslave quarters had only the cheapest and barest necessities. His mother\r\nhad no stove but cooked in the fire place using a skillet and spider\r\n(skillet, a small metal vessel with handle used for cooking; spider, a\r\nkind of frying pan, Winston's Simplified Dictionary, 1924). The cooking\r\nwas not done directly on the coals in the fire place but placed on the\r\nhearth and hot coals pulled around them, more coals being pulled about\r\nuntil the food was cooked as desired. Corn bread, beans, sweet potatoes\r\n(Irish potatoes being unknown) and collard greens were the principal\r\nfoods eaten. Corn bread was made as it is today, only cooked\r\ndifferently. The corn meal after being mixed was wrapped in tannion\r\nleaves (elephant ears) and placed in hot coals. The leaves would parch\r\nto a crisp and when the bread was removed it was a beautiful brown and\r\nunburned. Sweet potatoes were roasted in the hot coals. Corn was often\r\nroasted in the shucks. There was a substitute for coffee that afforded a\r\nstriking similarity in taste. The husks of the grains of corn were\r\nparched, hot water was then poured in this, the result was a pleasant\r\nliquid substitute for coffee. These was another bread used as a desert,\r\nknown as potato bread, made by tailing potatoes until done, then\r\nmashing, adding grease and meal, this was baked and then it was ready to\r\nserve. For lights, candles were made of tallow which was poured into a\r\nmould when hot. A cord was run through the center of the candle\r\nimpression in the mould in which the tallow was poured, when this cooled\r\nthe candle with cord was all ready for lighting.\r\n\r\nThe only means of obtaining water was from an open well. No ice was\r\nused. The first ice that Claude ever saw in its regular form was in\r\nJacksonville after Emancipation. This ice was naturally frozen and\r\nshipped from the north to be sold. It was called Lake Ice.\r\n\r\nTanning and curing pig and cow hides was done, but Claude never saw the\r\nprocess performed during slavery. Claude had no special duties on the\r\nplantation on account of his youth. After cotton was picked from the\r\nfields the seeds were picked out by hand, the cotton was then carded for\r\nfurther use. The cotton seed was used as fertilizer. In baling cotton\r\nburlap bags were used on the bales. The soap used was made from taking\r\nhickory or oak wood and burning it to ashes. The ashes were placed in a\r\ntub and water poured over them. This was left to set. After setting for\r\na certain time the water from the ashes was poured into a pot containing\r\ngrease. This was boiled for a certain time and then left to cool. The\r\nresult was a pot full of soft substance varying in color from white to\r\nyellow, this was called lye soap. This was then cut into bars as desired\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nFor dyeing thread and cloth, red oak bark, sweet gum bark and shoe make\r\nroots were boiled in water. The wash tubs were large wooden tubs having\r\none handle with holes in it for the fingers. Chicken and goose feathers\r\nwere always carefully saved to make feather mattresses. Claude remembers\r\nwhen women wore hoop skirts. He was about 20 years of age when narrow\r\nskirts became fashionable for women. During slavery the family only used\r\nslats on the beds, it was after the war that he saw his first spring bed\r\nand at that tine the first buggy. This buggy was driven by ex-governor\r\nReid of Florida who then lived in South Jacksonville. It was a\r\nfour-wheeled affair drawn by a horse and looked sensible and natural as\r\na vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe paper money in circulation was called \"shin plasters.\" Claude's\r\nuncle, Mark Clark joined the Northern Army. His master did not go to war\r\nbut remained on the plantation. One day at noon during the war the gin\r\nhouse was seen to be afire, one of the slaves rushed in and found the\r\nmaster badly burned and writhing in pain. He was taken from the building\r\nand given first aid, but his body being burned in oil and so badly\r\nburned it burst open, thus ended the life of the kindly master of\r\nClaude.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of the southern Army wore gray uniforms with gray caps and\r\nthe soldiers of the Northern Army wore blue.\r\n\r\nAfter the war such medicines as castor oil, rhubarb, colomel and blue\r\nmass and salts were generally used. The Civil War raged for some tine\r\nand the slaves on Dexter's plantation prayed for victory of the Northern\r\nArmy, though they dared not show their anxiety to Mary Ann Dexter who\r\nwas master and mistress since the master's death. Claude and his family\r\nremained with the Dexters until peace was declared. Mrs. Dexter informed\r\nthe slaves thay they could stay with her if they so desired and that she\r\nwould furnish everything to cultivate the crops and that she would give\r\nthem half of what was raised. None of the slaves remained but all were\r\nanxious to see what freedom was like.\r\n\r\nClaude recalls that a six-mule team drove up to the house driven by a\r\ncolored Union soldier. He helped move the household furniture from their\r\ncabin into the wagon. The family then got in, some in the seat with the\r\ndriver, and others in back of the wagon with the furniture. When the\r\ndriver pulled off he said to Claude's mother who was sitting on the seat\r\nwith him, \"Doan you know you is free now?\" \"Yeh Sir,\" she answered, \"I\r\nbeen praying for dis a long time.\" \"Come on den les go,\" he answered,\r\nand drove off. They passed through Olustee, then Sanderson, Macclenny\r\nand finally Baldwin. It was raining and they were about 20 miles from\r\ntheir destination, Jacksonville, but they drove on. They reached\r\nJacksonville and were taken to a house that stood on Liberty street,\r\nnear Adams. White people had been living there but had left before the\r\nNorthern advance. There they unloaded and were told that this would be\r\ntheir new home. The town was full of colored soldiers all armed with\r\nmuskets. Horns and drums could be heard beating and blowing every\r\nmorning and evening. The colored soldiers appeared to rule the town.\r\nMore slaves were brought in and there they were given food by the\r\nGovernment which consisted of hard tack (bread reddish in appearance and\r\nextremely hard which had to be soaked in water before eating.) The meat\r\nwas known as \"salt horse.\" This looked and tasted somewhat like corned\r\nbeef. After being in Jacksonville a short while Claude began to peddle\r\nginger bread and apples in a little basket, selling most of his wares to\r\nthe colored soldiers.\r\n\r\nHis father got employment with a railroad company in Jacksonville, known\r\nas the Florida Central Railway and received 99¢ a day, which was\r\nconsidered very good pay. His mother got a job with a family as house\r\nwoman at a salary of eight dollars a month. They were thus considered\r\ngetting along fine. They remained in the house where the Government\r\nplaced them for about a year, then his father bought a piece of land in\r\ntown and built a house of straight boards. There they resided until his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBy this time many of the white people began to return to their homes\r\nwhich had been abandoned and in which slaves found shelter. In many\r\ninstances the whites had to make monetary or other concessions in order\r\nto get their homes back. It was said that colored people had taken\r\npossession of one of the large white churches of the day, located on\r\nLogon street, between Ashley and Church streets. Claude relates that all\r\nthis was when Jacksonville was a mere village, with cow and hog pens in\r\nwhat was considered as downtown. The principal streets were: Pine (now\r\nMain), Market and Forsyth. The leading stores were Wilson's and Clark's.\r\nThese stores handled groceries, dry goods and whisky.\r\n\r\nAs a means of transportation two-wheeled drays were used, mule or\r\nhorse-drawn cars, which was to come into use later were not operating at\r\nthat time. To cross the Saint Johns River one had to go in a row boat,\r\nwhich was the only ferry and was operated by the ex-governor Reid of\r\nFlorida. It docked on the north side of the river at the foot of Ocean\r\nStreet, and on the south side at the foot of old Kings Road. It ran\r\nbetween these two points, carrying passengers to and fro.\r\n\r\nThe leading white families living in Jacksonville at that time were the\r\nHartridges, Bostwicks, Doggetts, Bayels and L'Engles.\r\n\r\nClaude Augusta Wilson, a man along in years has lived to see many\r\nchanges take place among his people since The Emancipation which he is\r\nproud of. A peaceful old gentleman he is, still alert mentally and\r\nphysically despite his 79 years. His youthful appearance belies his age.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n\r\n1. Personal interview with Claude Augusta Wilson, Sunbeam, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\nJune 30, 1938\r\n\r\nDADE COUNTY, FLORIDA EX-SLAVE STORIES\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLEY ROBERTS:\r\n\r\nCharley Roberts of Perrine, Florida, was born on the Hogg plantation\r\nnear Allendale, S.C.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sah, I' members de vary day when we first heard that we was free.\r\nI was mindin' the little calf, keepin' it away from the cow while my\r\nmother was milkin'.\r\n\r\n\"We have to milk the cows and carry the milk to the Confederate soldiers\r\nquartered near us.\r\n\r\n\"At that time, I can 'member of the soldiers comin' 'cross the Savannah\r\nRiver. They would go to the plantations and take all the cows, hogs,\r\nsheep, or horses they wanted and \"stack\" their guns and stay around some\r\nplaces and kill some of the stock, or use the milk and eat corn and all\r\nthe food they wanted as they needed it. They'd take quilts and just\r\nanything they needed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why, but I remember we didn't have salt given to us, so we\r\nwent to the smoke house where there were clean boards on the floor where\r\nthe salt and grease drippings would fall from the smoked hams hanging\r\nfrom the rafters. The boards would be soft and soaked with salt and\r\ngrease. Well, we took those boards and cooked the salt and fat out of\r\nthem, cooked the boards right in the bean soup. That way we got salt and\r\nthe soup was good.\r\n\r\n\"They used to give us rinds off the hams. I was a big boy before I ever\r\nknew there was anything but rinds a pork meat. We went around chewing\r\naway at those rinds of hams, and we sure liked them. We thought that was\r\nthe best meat there was.\r\n\r\n\"I used to go to the Baptist church in the woods, but I never went to\r\nschool. I learned to read out of McGuffey's speller. It was a little\r\nbook with a blue back. I won't forget that.\r\n\r\n\"I try to be as good as I know how. I've never given the state any\r\ntrouble, nor any of my sons have been arrested. I tries to follow the\r\nGolden Rule and do right.\r\n\r\n\"I have seven living children. We moved to Miami when our daughter moved\r\nhere and took sick. We live at Perrine now, but we want to come to\r\nMiami, 'cause I aint able to work, but my wife, she is younger and able\r\nto work. We don't want to go on charity any more'n we have to.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNIE COLDER:\r\n\r\nJennie Colder was born in Georgia on Blatches' settlement. \"Blatches, he\r\nkep's big hotel, too and he kep' \"right smart\" slaves. By the time I was\r\nold enough to remember anything we was all' free, but we worked hard. My\r\nfather and mother died on the settlement.\r\n\r\n\"I picked cotton, shucked cotton, pulled fodder and corn and done all\r\ndat. I plowed with mules. Dis is Jennie Colder, remember dat. Don't\r\nforget it. I done all dat. I plowed with mules and even then the\r\noverseer whipped me. I dont know exactly how old I am, but I was born\r\nbefore freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBANANA WILLIAMS:\r\n\r\nBanana Williams, 1740 N.W. 5th Court, Miami, Florida was born in Grady\r\nCounty, Georgia, near Cairo in the 16th District.\r\n\r\n\"The man what I belonged to was name Mr. Sacks. My mother and father\r\nlived there. I was only about three years old when peace came, but I\r\nremember when the paddle rollers came there and whipped a man and woman.\r\n\r\n\"I was awful 'fraid, for that was somethin' I nevah see before. We\r\n\"stayed on\" but we left before I was old enough to work, but I did work\r\nin the fields in Mitchell County.\r\n\r\n\"I came to Miami and raised 5 children. I'm staying with my daughter,\r\nbut I'm not able to work much. I'm too done played out with old age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANK BATES:\r\n\r\nFrank Bates, 367 N.W. 10th Street, Miami, Florida was born on Hugh Lee\r\nBates' farm in Alabama in the country not very far from Mulberry Beat.\r\n\r\n\"My mother and father lived on the same plantation, but I was too little\r\nto do more than tote water to the servants in the fields.\r\n\r\n\"I saw Old Bates whip my mother once for leaving her finger print in the\r\npone bread when she patted it down before she put it into the oven.\r\n\r\n\"I remember seeing Lundra, Oscar and Luke Bates go off to war on three\r\nfine horses. I dont know whether they ever came back or not, for we\r\nmoved that same day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM NEIGHTEN:\r\n\r\nWilliam Neighten gave his address as 60th Street, Liberty City. He was\r\nonly a baby when freedom came, but he too, \"stayed on\" a long time\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nHe did not know his real name, but he was given his Massy's name.\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask me how much work I had to do. Gracious! I used to plow and\r\nhoed a lot and everything else and then did'nt do enough. I got too many\r\nwhippings besides.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVIANA BOYNTON:\r\n\r\nRivana Williams Boynton [TR: as in earlier interview, but Riviana,\r\nabove] was born on John and Mollie Hoover's plantation near Ulmers,\r\nS.C., being 15 years of age when the 'Mancipation came.\r\n\r\n\"Our Boss man, he had \"planty\" of slaves. We lived in a log houses. My\r\nfather was an Indian and he ran away to war, but I don't 'member\r\nanything of my mother. She was sold and taken away 'fore I ever knew\r\nanything of her.\r\n\r\n\"I 'member that I had to thin cotton in the fields and mind the flies in\r\nthe house. I had a leafy branch that was cut from a tree. I'd stand and\r\nwave that branch over the table to keep the flies out of the food.\r\n\r\n\"I'd work like that in the day time and at night I'd sleep in my uncle's\r\nshed. We had long bunks along the side of the walls. We had no beds,\r\njust gunny sacks nailed to the bunks, no slats, no springs, no nothing\r\nelse. You know how these here sortin' trays are made,--these here trays\r\nthat they use to sort oranges and 'matoes. Well, we had to sleep on gunn\r\nsack beds.\r\n\r\n\"They had weavin' looms where they made rugs and things. I used to holp\r\n'em tear rags and sew 'em an' make big balls and then they'd weave those\r\nrugs,--rag rugs, you know. That's what we had to cover ourselves with.\r\nWe didn't had no quilts nor sheets not nothin like that.\"\r\n\r\n[TR: The following portion of this interview is a near repeat of a\r\nportion of an earlier interview with this informant; however it is\r\nincluded here because the transcription varies.]\r\n\r\n\"I 'member well when the war was on. I used to turn the corn sheller and\r\nsack the shelled corn for the Confederate soldiers. They used to sell\r\nsome of the corn, and I guess they gave some of it to the soldiers.\r\nAnyway the Yankees got some that they didn't intend them to get.\r\n\r\n\"It was this way:\r\n\r\n\"The Wheeler Boys were Confederates. They came down the road as happy as\r\ncould be, a-singin':\r\n\r\n  'Hurrah! Hur rah! Hurrah!\r\n  Hurrah! for the Broke Brook boys.\r\n  Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n  Hurrah for the Broke Brook boys of South Car-o-li-ne-ah.'\r\n\r\n\"So of course, we thought they were our soldiers singin' our songs.\r\nWell, they came and tol' our boss that the Yankees were coming and we\r\nhad better hide our food and valuable things for they'd take everything\r\nthey wanted.\r\n\r\n\"So they helped our Massy hide the things. They dug holes and buried the\r\npotatoes and covered them over with cotton seed. Then our Massy gave\r\nthem food for their kindness and set out with two of the girls to take\r\nthem to a place of safety, and before he could come back for the Missus\r\nThe Yankees were upon us.\r\n\r\n\"But before they got there, our Missus had called us together and told\r\nus what to say.\r\n\r\n\"Now you beg for us! You can save our lives. If they ask you if we are\r\ngood to you, you tell them, 'YES'!\r\n\r\n\"If they ask you, if we give your meat, you tell them 'YES'!\r\n\r\n\"Now the rest didn't get any meat, but I did 'cause I worked in the\r\nhouse, so I didn't tell a lie, for I did get meat, but the rest didn't\r\nget it.\r\n\r\n\"We saw the Yankees coming. They never stopped for nothing. Their horses\r\nwould jump the worn rail fences and they'd come right across the fiel's\r\nan' everything.\r\n\r\n\"They came to the house first and bound our Missus up stairs so she\r\ncouldn't get away, then they came out to the sheds and asked us all kind\r\nof questions.\r\n\r\n\"We begged for our Missus and we say:\r\n\r\n  'Our Missus is good. Don't kill her!\r\n  'Dont take our meat away from us!\r\n  'Dont hurt our Missus!\r\n  'Dont burn the house down!\r\n\r\n[TR: The rest of the interview is new information.]\r\n\r\n\"We begged so hard that they unloosened her, but they took some of the\r\nothers for refugees and some of the slaves volunteered and went off with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"They took potatoes and all the hams they wanted, but they left our\r\nMissus, 'cause me save her life.\r\n\r\n\"The Uncle what I libbed with, he was awful full of all kinds of\r\ndevilment. He stole sweet taters out of the bank. He called them \"pot\"\r\nroots and sometimes he called them \"blow horts\". You know they wuld blow\r\nup big and fat when they were roasted in the ashes.\r\n\r\n\"My uncle, he liked those blow horts mighty well, and one day, when he\r\nhad some baked in the fireplace, Ole Massy Hoover, he came along and\r\npeeked in through the \"hold\" in de chimley wall, where the stones didn't\r\nfit too good.\r\n\r\n\"He stood there and peeked in an' saw my uncle eat in' those blow\r\nhorts. He had a big long one shakin' the ashes off on it. He was blowing\r\nit to cool it off so he could eat it and he was a-sayin'\r\n\r\n\"'Um! does blowhorts is mighty good eatin'. Then Massy, he come in wid\r\nhis big whip, and caught him and tied him to a tree and paddled him\r\nuntil he blistered and then washed his sore back with strong salt water.\r\nYou know they used to use salt for all of sores, but it sho' did smart.\r\n\r\n\"My aunt, she was an Indian woman. She didn't want my uncle to steal,\r\nbut he was just full of all kind of devilment.\r\n\r\n\"My Massy liked him, but one day he played a trick on him.\r\n\r\n\"My Uncle took sick, he was so sick that when my Massy came to see him,\r\nhe asked him to pray that he should die. So Massy Hoover, he went home\r\nand wrapped himself up in a big long sheet and rapped on the door real\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle, he say, 'who's out there? What you want?'\r\n\r\n\"Massy, he change his voice and say, 'I am Death. I hear that you want\r\nto die, so I've come after your soul. Com with me! Get ready. Quick I am\r\nin a hurry!'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, my sakes!' my uncle, he say, 'NO, no I aint ready yet. I aint ready\r\nto meet you. I don't want to die.'\r\n\r\n\"My Missus whipped me once, but not so very hard. I was under Her\r\ndaughter, Miss Mollie. She liked me and always called me \"Tinker\". When\r\nshe heard me crying and goin' on, she called:\r\n\r\n\"'Tinker, come here. What's the matter? Did you Missus whip you?'\r\n\r\n\"Then my Missus said, 'Tinker was a bad girl, I told her to sweep the\r\nyard and she went off and hid all day.'\r\n\r\n\"Mollie, she took me up in her arms and said, 'They mustn't whip\r\nTinker; she's my little girl.'\r\n\r\n\"If it hadn't been for Miss Mollie, I don't know where I'd be now. I\r\nmarried right after freedom. My husband, Alexander Boynton and I stayed\r\nright on the plantation and farmed on the shares.\r\n\r\n\"We had planty of children,--18 in all.--three sets of twins. They all\r\ngrew up, except the twins, they didn't any of them get old enough to get\r\nmarried, but all the rest lived and raised children.\r\n\r\n\"They are all scattered around, but my youngest son is only 38 years\r\nold. I have grand-children, 40 years old.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know just how many, but I have 20 grand-children and I have\r\nthree generations of grand-children. Yes, my grand-children, some of\r\nthem, have grand-children. That makes five generations.\r\n\r\n\"I tell them that I am a \"gitzy, gitzy\" grand-mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I live right here with my daughter. She's my baby girl. I'm not very\r\nstrong anymore, but I have a big time telling stories to my\r\ngreat-grand-children and great-great-grand children\".\r\n\r\n\r\nSALENA TASWELL:\r\n\r\nSalena Taswell, 364 NW 8th St. Miami, Florida, is one of the oldest\r\nex-slave women in Miami. Like most ex-slaves she is very courteous; she\r\nwill talk about the \"old times\", if she has once gained confidence in\r\nyou, but her answers will be so laconic that two or three visits are\r\nnecessary in order for an interviewer to gain tangible information\r\nwithout appearing too proddish.\r\n\r\nWith short, measured step, bent form, unsteady head, wearing a beaming\r\nsmile, Salena takes the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Ole Dr. Jameson, he wuz my Massy. He had a plantation three mile from\r\nPerry, Georgia. I can 'member whole lots about working for them. Y' see\r\nI was growned up when peace came.\r\n\r\n\"My mother used to be a seamstress and sewed with her fingers all the\r\ntime. She made the finest kind of stitches while I worked around de\r\ntable or did any other kind of house work.\r\n\r\n\"I knowed de time when Ab'ram Linkum come to de plantation. He come\r\nthrough there on the train and stopped over night oncet. He was known by\r\nDr. Jameson and he came to Perry to see about the food for the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"We all had part in intertainin' him. Some shined his shoes, some cooked\r\nfor him, an' I waited on de table, I can't forget that. We had chicken\r\nhash and batter cakes and dried venison that day. You be sure we knowed\r\nhe was our friend and we catched what he had t' say. Now, he said this:\r\n(I never forget that 'slong as I live) 'If they free de people, I'll\r\nbring you back into the Union' (To Dr. Jameson) 'If you don't free your\r\nslaves, I'll \"whip\" you back into the Union. Before I'd allow my wife\r\nan' children to be sold as slaves, I'll wade in blood and water up to my\r\nneck'.\r\n\r\n\"Now he said all that, if my mother and father were living, they'd tell\r\ny' the same thing. That's what Linkum said.\r\n\r\n\"He came through after Freedom and went to the 'Sheds' first. I couldn't\r\n'magine what was going on, but they came runnin' to tell me and what a\r\ntime we had.\r\n\r\n\"Linkum went to the smoke house and opened the door and said 'Help\r\nyourselves; take what you need; cook yourselves a good meall and we sho'\r\nhad a celebration!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Dr. didn't care; he was lib'ral. After Freedom, when any of us got\r\nmarried he'd give us money and send a servant along for us. Sometimes\r\neven he'd carry us himself to our new home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, FOLKLORE\r\n\r\nMIAMI'S EX-SLAVES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a unique organization in the colored population of Miami known\r\nas the \"Ex Slave Club.\" This club now claims twenty-five members, all\r\nover 65 years of age and all of whom were slaves in this country prior\r\nto the Civil War. The members of this interesting group are shown in the\r\naccompanying photograph. The stories of their lives as given verbatim by\r\nthese aged men and women are recorded in the following stories:\r\n\r\n\r\nANNIE TRIP:\r\n\r\n\"My name's Annie Trip. How my name's Trip, I married a Trip, but I was\r\nborned in Georgia in the country not so very far from Thomasville. I'm\r\nsure you must ha' heard of Thomasville, Georgia. Well, that's where I\r\nwas borned, on Captain Hamlin's plantation.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Hamlin, he was a greatest lawyer. Henry Hamlin, you know he was\r\nthe greatest lawyer what ever was, so dey tell me. You see I was small.\r\nMy mother and father and four brothers all lived there together. Some of\r\nthe rest were too small to remember much, but dey wuz all borned dare\r\njust de samey. Wish I wuz dare right now. I had plenty of food then. I\r\ndidn't need to bother about money. Didn't have none. Didn't have no\r\ndebts to pay, no bother not like now.\r\n\r\n\"Now I have rheumatism and everything, but no money. Didn't need any\r\nmoney on Captain Hamlin's plantation.\" And Annie walked away complaining\r\nabout rheumatism and no money, etc. before her exact age and address\r\ncould be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLIE SAMPSON:\r\n\r\nMillie Sampson, 182 W. 14th St. Miami, Florida, was born in Manning,\r\nS.C. only three years 'bfo' Peace\".\r\n\r\n\"My mother and father were born on the same plantation and I di'n't\r\nhave nothin' to do 'sept play with the white children and have plenty to\r\neat. My mother and father were field han's. I learned to talk from the\r\nwhite children.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nANNIE GAIL:\r\n\r\nAnnie Gail, 1661 NW 6th Court, Miami, Florida, was four years old when\r\n\"peace came.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was borned on Faggott's place near Greenville, Alabama. My mother,\r\nshe worked for Faggott. He wuz her bossman. When she'd go out to de\r\nfiel's, I 'member I used to watch her, for somehow I wuz feared she would\r\nget away from me.\r\n\r\n\"Now I 'member dat jes ez good as 'twas yesterday. I didn't do anything.\r\nI just runned 'round.\r\n\r\n\"We just 'stayed on' after de' 'Mancipation'. My mother, she was hired\r\nthen. I guess I wuzn't 'fraid ob her leavin' after dat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJESSIE ROWELL:\r\n\r\nJessie Rowell, 331 NW 19th St., Miami, Florida was born in Mississippi,\r\nbetween Fossburg and Heidelberg, on the Gaddis plantation.\r\n\r\n\"My grandmother worked in the house, but my mother worked in the field\r\nhoeing or picking cotton or whatever there was to do. I was too little\r\nto work.\r\n\r\n\"All that I can 'member is, that I was just a little tot running 'round,\r\nand I would always watch for my mother to come home. I was always glad\r\nto see her, for the day was long and I knew she'd cook something for me\r\nto eat. I can 'member dat es good as 'twas yestiday.\r\n\r\n\"We 'stayed on' after Freedom. Mother was give wages then, but I don't\r\nknow how much.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET WHITE:\r\n\r\nMargaret White, 6606 18th Ave., Liberty City, Miami. Florida is one of\r\nthose happy creatures who doesn't look as if she ever had a care in the\r\nworld. She speaks good English:\r\n\r\n\"I am now 84 years old, for I was 13 when the Emancipation Proclamation\r\nwas made. It didn't make much difference to me. I had a good home and\r\nwas treated very nicely.\r\n\r\n\"My master was John Eckels. He owned a large fruit place near Federal,\r\nN.C.\r\n\r\n\"My father was a tailor and made the clothes for his master and his\r\nservants. I was never sold. My master just kept me. They liked me and\r\nwouldn't let me be sold. He never whipped me, for I was a slave, you\r\nknow, and I had to do just as I was told.\r\n\r\n\"I worked around the house doing maid's work. I also helped to care for\r\nthe children in the home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRISCILLA MITCHELL:\r\n\r\nPriscilla Mitchell, 1614 NW 5th Ave., was born in Macon County, Alabama,\r\nMarch 17, 1858.\r\n\r\n\"Y' see, ah wuz oney 7 years old when ah wuz 'mancipated. I can 'member\r\npickin' cotton, but I didn't work so hard, ah wuz too young.\r\n\r\n\"I wuz my Massy's pet. No, no he wouldn't beat me. Whenever ah's bad or\r\ndid little things that my mother didn't want me to do and she'd go to\r\nwhip me, all I needed to do was to run to my Massy and he'd take me up\r\nand not let my mother git me.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a sample of the attitude that very many have toward their\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFANNIE McCAY:\r\n\r\nFannie McCay, 1720 NW 3rd Court, Miami, Florida was born on a plantation\r\nwhile her father and mother were slaves; she claims her age is 73 years\r\nwhich would make her too young to remember \"mancipation\" but\r\nnevertheless she was slave property of her master and could have been\r\nsold or given away even at that tender age. Her parents, too, \"stayed\r\non\" quite a while after the \"mancipation\".\r\n\r\nBeing one of those who \"didn't have too much time to talk too much,\" her\r\nmain statement was:\r\n\r\n\"'Bout all hi ken 'member is dat hi hused go hout wid de old folks when\r\ndey went out to pick cotton. Hi used to pick a little along.\r\n\r\n\"I had plenty to eat and when we went away, my Massy had a little calf\r\nthat I liked so well. I begged my Massy to give it to me, but he never\r\ngave me none.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHATTIE THOMAS:\r\n\r\nHattie Thomas was six years old when peace was declared. She was\r\n'borned' near Custer, Ga. on Bob Morris' plantation. At the tender age\r\nof five, she can remember of helping to care for the other children,\r\nsome of whom were her own brothers and children, for her mother kept her\r\neight children with her.\r\n\r\nBob Morris' plantation being a large one, the problem of feeding all the\r\nslaves and their children was, in itself, a large one. Hattie can well\r\nremember of 'towing' the milk to the long wooden troughs for the\r\nchildren. Her mother and the other servants would throw bread crusts and\r\ncorn breads into the milk troughs and when they would become\r\nwell-soaked, all the little slave-children would line up with their\r\nspoons.\r\n\r\n\"So it happened that the ones who could eat the fastest would be the\r\nones who would get the fattest.\r\n\r\n\"We had a good plenty to eat and it didn't make much difference how it\r\nwas served. We got it just the same and didn 't know any better.\r\n\r\n\"We stayed on after de 'mancipation an' ah wants t' tell y' ah worked\r\nhard in dose days. Of course, ah worked hardest after Peace wuz\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n\"I wuz on dat plantation when there wuz no matches. Yes, dat wuz befo'\r\nmatches wuz made an' many-a time ah started fire in de open fire place\r\nby knookin' two stones together until I'd sen' sparks into a wad\r\no'cotton until it took fire.\r\n\r\n\"Now, mind y' this was on Bob Morrison's plantation between Custard and\r\nCotton Hill, Ga. We had no made brooms; we just bound broom corn tops\r\ntogether and used them for brooms and brushes. We didn't have no stoves\r\neither. We just cooked in a high pot on a rack. I done all dat.\r\n\r\n\"Ah haint had no husband for 38 years, but ah raised two sets\r\no'chilluns, nine in all and now ah has 25 grandchildren and I don't know\r\nhow many great gran' chillun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID LEE:\r\n\r\nDavid Lee, 1006 NW 1st Court, Miami, Fla. is proud of his \"missus\" and\r\nthe training he received on the plantation.\r\n\r\n\"Ah can't tell y' 'zackkly mah age, but ah knows dat when Freedom was\r\ndeclared, ah was big 'nough ter drive a haws an' buggy', for ah had nice\r\nfolks. Ah could tell u' right smart 'bout 'em.\r\n\r\n\"Ah libbed near Cusper, Ga. on Barefield's fahm. Dare daughter, Miss Ann\r\nBarefield, she taught a school few miles away, 'round pas' the Post\r\nHoffice.

Ah had all de clothes ah could we ah and all ah could eat and\r\ndidn't need playthings, couldn't read much, and didn't know where to buy\r\nany books. Ah had hit good.\r\n\r\n\"When peace wuz signed, dey gib me lots of Confederate bills to play\r\nwith. Ah had ten-dollah bills and lots o' twenty-dollah bills, good\r\nbills, but y'know dey wus 't wuth nothing.
