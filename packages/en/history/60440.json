II.\r\n\r\n  THE STREET-FOLK.\r\n  BOOK THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn commencing a new volume I would devote a few pages to the\r\nconsideration of the import of the facts already collected concerning\r\nthe London Street-Folk, not only as regards the street-people\r\nthemselves, but also in connection with the general society of which\r\nthey form so large a proportion.\r\n\r\nThe precise extent of the proportion which the Street-Traders bear\r\nto the rest of the Metropolitan Population is the first point to be\r\nevolved; for the want, the ignorance, and the vice of a street-life\r\nbeing in a direct ratio to the numbers, it becomes of capital\r\nimportance that we should know how many are seeking to pick up a\r\nlivelihood in the public thoroughfares. This is the more essential\r\nbecause the Government returns never _have_ given us, and probably\r\nnever _will_ give us, any correct information respecting it. The\r\nCensus of 1841 set down the “Hawkers, Hucksters, and Pedlars” of the\r\nMetropolis as numbering 2045; and from the inquiries I have made among\r\nthe street-sellers as to the means taken to obtain a full account\r\nof their numbers for the next population return, the Census of 1851\r\nappears likely to be about as correct in its statements concerning the\r\nStreet Traders and Performers as the one which preceded it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the accounts which have been collected during the\r\nprogress of this work, the number of the London Street-People, so\r\nfar as the inquiry has gone, is upwards of 40,000. This sum is made\r\nup of 30,000 Costermongers; 2000 Street-Sellers of “Green-Stuff,” as\r\nWatercresses, Chickweed, and Groundsell, Turf, &c.; 4000 Street Sellers\r\nof Eatables and Drinkables; 1000 selling Stationery, Books, Papers,\r\nand Engravings in the streets; and 4000 other street-sellers vending\r\nmanufactured articles, either of metal, crockery, textile, chemical, or\r\nmiscellaneous substances, making altogether 41,000, or in round numbers\r\nsay 40,000 individuals. The 30,000 costermongers may be said to include\r\n12,000 men, 6000 women, and 12,000 children.\r\n\r\nThe above numbers comprise the main body of people selling in\r\nthe London streets; hence if we assert that, with the vendors of\r\nsecond-hand articles, as old metal, glass, linen, clothes, &c., and\r\nmineral productions, such as coke, salt, and sand, there are about\r\n45,000 street-traders in the Metropolis, we shall not, I am satisfied,\r\nbe very far from the truth.\r\n\r\nThe value of the Capital, or Stock in Trade, of these people, though\r\nindividually trifling, amounts, collectively, to a considerable sum\r\nof money--indeed, to very nearly 40,000_l._, or at the rate of about\r\n1_l._ per head. Under the term Capital are included the donkeys,\r\nbarrows, baskets, stalls, trays, boards, and goods belonging to the\r\nseveral street-traders; and though the stock of the water-cress, the\r\nsmall-ware, the lucifer, the flower, or the chickweed and groundsell\r\nseller may not exceed in value 1_s._, and the basket or tray upon\r\nwhich it is carried barely half that sum, that of the more prosperous\r\ncostermonger, possessed of his barrow and donkey; or of the Cheap John,\r\nwith his cart filled with hardware; or the Packman, with his bale of\r\nsoft wares at his back, may be worth almost as many pounds as the\r\nothers are pence.\r\n\r\nThe gross amount of trade done by the London Street-Sellers in the\r\ncourse of the year is so large that the mind is at first unable to\r\ncomprehend how, without reckless extravagance, want can be in any way\r\nassociated with the class. After the most cautious calculation, the\r\nresults having been checked and re-checked in a variety of ways, so\r\nthat the conclusion arrived at might be somewhat near and certainly\r\nnot beyond the truth, it appears that the “_takings_” of the London\r\nStreet-Sellers cannot be said to be less than 2,500,000_l._ per annum.\r\nBut vast as this sum may seem, and especially when considered as only a\r\nportion of the annual expenditure of the Metropolitan Poor, still, when\r\nwe come to spread the gross yearly receipts over 40,000 people, we find\r\nthat the individual takings are but 62_l._ per annum, which (allowing\r\nthe rate of profit to be in all cases even 50 per cent., though I am\r\nconvinced it is often much less) gives to each street-trader an annual\r\nincome of 20_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._, or within a fraction of 8_s._ a week,\r\nall the year round. And when we come to deduct from this the loss\r\nby perishable articles, the keep of donkeys, the wear and tear, or\r\nhire, of barrows--the cost of stalls and baskets, together with the\r\ninterest on stock-money (generally at the rate of 4_s._ a week--and\r\noften 1_s._ a day--for 1_l._, or 1040_l._ per cent. per annum), we\r\nmay with safety assert that the average gain or clear income of the\r\nMetropolitan Street-Sellers is rather under than over 7_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nweek. Some of the more expert street-traders may clear 10_s._ or even\r\n15_s._ weekly throughout the year, while the weekly profit of the less\r\nexpert, the old people, and the children, may be said to be 3_s._ 6_d._\r\nThese incomes, however, are the average of the gross yearly profits\r\nrather than the regular weekly gains; the consequence is, that though\r\nthey might be sufficient to keep the majority of the street-sellers in\r\ncomparative comfort, were they constant and capable of being relied\r\nupon, from week to week--but being variable and uncertain, and rising\r\nsometimes from nothing in the winter to 1_l._ a week in the summer,\r\nwhen street commodities are plentiful and cheap, and the poorer classes\r\nhave money wherewith to purchase them--and fluctuating moreover, even\r\nat the best of times, according as the weather is wet or fine, and the\r\ntraffic of the streets consequently diminished or augmented--it is but\r\nnatural that the people subject to such alternations should lack the\r\nprudence and temperance of those whose incomes are more regular and\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nTo place the above facts clearly before the reader the following table\r\nhas been prepared. The first column states the titles of the several\r\nclasses of street-sellers; the second, the number of individuals\r\nbelonging to each of these classes; the third, the value of their\r\nrespective capitals or stock in trade; the fourth, the gross amount\r\nof trade done by them respectively every year; the fifth, the average\r\nyearly takings of each class; and the sixth, their average weekly\r\ngains. This gives us, as it were, a bird’s-eye view of the earnings\r\nand pecuniary condition of the various kinds of street-sellers already\r\ntreated of. It is here cited, as indeed all the statistics in this\r\nwork are, as an approximation to the truth rather than a definite and\r\naccurate result.\r\n\r\n

that the gross\r\nannual receipts of the entire body of street-sellers (for there are\r\nmany besides those above specified--as for instance, the vendors\r\nof second-hand articles, &c.) may be estimated in round numbers at\r\n3,000,000_l._ sterling, and their clear income at about 1,000,000_l._\r\nper annum. Hence, we are enabled to perceive the importance of\r\nthe apparently insignificant traffic of the streets; for were the\r\nstreet-traders to be prohibited from pursuing their calling, and so\r\nforced to apply for relief at the several metropolitan unions, the\r\npoor-rates would be at the least doubled. The total sum expended in\r\nthe relief of the London poor, during 1848, was 725,000_l._, but this\r\nwe see is hardly three-fourths of the income of the street-traders.\r\nThose, therefore, who would put an end to the commerce of our streets,\r\nshould reflect whether they would like to do so at the cost of doubling\r\nthe present poor-rates and of reducing one-fortieth part of the entire\r\nmetropolitan population from a state of comparative independence to\r\nabsolute pauperism.\r\n\r\nHowever unsatisfactory it may be to the aristocratic pride of the\r\nwealthy commercial classes, it cannot be denied that a very important\r\nelement of the trade of this vast capital--this marvellous centre of\r\nthe commerce of the world--I cite the stereotype phrases of civic\r\neloquence, for they are at least truths--it is still undeniable, I\r\nsay, that a large proportion of the commerce of the capital of Great\r\nBritain is in the hands of the Street-Folk. This simple enunciation\r\nmight appear a mere platitude were it not that the street-sellers are\r\na _proscribed class_. They are driven from stations to which long\r\npossession might have been thought to give them a quasi legal right;\r\ndriven from them at the capricious desire of the shopkeepers, some of\r\nwhom have had bitter reason, by the diminution of their own business,\r\nto repent their interference. They are bandied about at the will of a\r\npolice-officer. They must “move on” and not obstruct a thoroughfare\r\nwhich may be crammed and blocked with the carriages of the wealthy\r\nuntil to cross the road on foot is a danger. They are, in fine, a body\r\nnumbering thousands, who are allowed to live in the prosecution of\r\nthe most ancient of all trades, sale or barter in the open air, _by\r\nsufferance alone_. They are classed as unauthorized or illegal and\r\nintrusive traders, though they _“turn over” millions in a year_.\r\n\r\nThe authorities, it is true, do not sanction any general arbitrary\r\nenforcement of the legal proscription of the Street-Folk, but they have\r\nno option if a section of shopkeepers choose to say to them, “Drive\r\naway from our doors these street-people.” It appears to be sufficient\r\nfor an inferior class of tradesmen--for such the meddlers with the\r\nstreet-folk generally seem to be--merely to desire such a removal in\r\norder to accomplish it. It is not necessary for them to say in excuse,\r\n“We pay heavy rents, and rates, and taxes, and are forced to let our\r\nlodgings accordingly; we pay for licences, and some of us as well pay\r\nfines for giving short weight to poor people, and that, too, when it\r\nis hardly safe to give short weight to our richer patrons; but what\r\nrates, taxes, or licences do these street-traders pay? Their lodgings\r\nmay be dear enough, but their rates are nominally nothing” (being\r\ncharged in the rent of their rooms). “From taxes they are blessedly\r\nexempt. They are called upon to pay no imposts on their property or\r\nincome; they defray merely the trifling duties on their tobacco, beer,\r\ntea, sugar, coffee” (though these by the way--the chief articles in\r\nthe excise and customs returns--make up one-half of the revenue of\r\nthe country). “They ought to be put down. _We_ can supply all that is\r\nwanting. What may become of _them_ is simply their own concern.”\r\n\r\nThe Act 50 Geo. III., c. 41, requires that every person “carrying to\r\nsell or exposing to sale any goods, wares, or merchandize,” shall pay\r\na yearly duty. But according to s. 23, “nothing in this Act shall\r\nextend to prohibit any person or persons from selling (by hawking in\r\nthe streets) any printed papers licensed by authority; or any fish,\r\nfruit, or victuals.” Among the privileged articles are also included\r\nbarm or yeast, and coals. The same Act, moreover, contains nothing to\r\nprohibit the maker of any home-manufacture from exposing his goods\r\nto sale in any town-market or fair, nor any tinker, cooper, glazier,\r\nor other artizan, from going about and carrying the materials of his\r\nbusiness. The unlicensed itinerant vendors of such things however as\r\nlucifer-matches, boot-laces, braces, fuzees, or any wares indeed, not\r\nof their own manufacture, are violators of the law, and subject to a\r\npenalty of 10_l._, or three months’ imprisonment for each offence. It\r\nis in practice, however, only in the hawking of such articles as those\r\non which the duty is heavy and of considerable value to the revenue\r\n(such as tea, tobacco, or cigars), that there is any actual check in\r\nthe London streets.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a large proportion of the street-trading without a\r\nlicence is contrary to law, and the people seeking to obtain a living\r\nby such means are strictly liable to fine or imprisonment, while even\r\nthose street-traders whom the Act specially exempts--as for instance\r\nthe street-sellers of fish, fruit, and vegetables, and of eatables and\r\ndrinkables, as well as the street artizans, and who are said to have\r\nthe right of “exposing their goods to sale in any market or fair in\r\nevery city, borough, town-corporate, and market-town”--even these, I\r\nsay, are liable to be punished for obstructing the highway whenever\r\nthey attempt to do so.\r\n\r\nNow these are surely anomalies which it is high time, in these\r\nfree-trade days, should cease. _The endeavour to obtain an honest and\r\nindependent livelihood should subject no man to fine or imprisonment_;\r\nnor should the poor hawker--the neediest perhaps of all tradesmen--be\r\nrequired to pay 4_l._ a year for the liberty to carry on his business\r\nwhen the wealthy shopkeeper can do so “scot-free.” Moreover, it is a\r\nglaring iniquity that the rich tradesman should have it in his power,\r\nby complaining to the police, to deprive his poorer rival of the\r\nright to dispose of his goods in the streets. It is often said, in\r\njustification, that as the shopkeepers pay the principal portion of\r\nthe rates and taxes, _they_ must be protected in the exercise of their\r\nbusiness. But this, in the first place, is far from the truth. As\r\nregards the taxes, the poorer classes pay nearly half of the national\r\nimposts: they pay the chief portion of the malt duty, and that is in\r\nround numbers 5,000,000_l._ a year; the greater part of the spirit\r\nduty, which is 4,350,000_l._; the tobacco duty, 4,250,000_l._; the\r\nsugar duty, 4,500,000_l._; and the duty on tea, 5,330,000_l._; making\r\naltogether 23,430,000_l._, out of about 50,000,000_l._ Concerning the\r\nrates, however, it is not so easy to estimate what proportion the poor\r\npeople contribute towards the local burdens of the country; but if\r\nthey are householders, they have to pay quota of the parish and county\r\nexpenses directly, and, if lodgers, indirectly in the rent of their\r\napartments. Hence it is evident, that to consider the street-sellers\r\nunworthy of being protected in the exercise of their calling because\r\nthey pay neither rates nor taxes, is to commit a gross injustice, not\r\nonly to the street-sellers themselves by forcing them to contribute\r\nin their tea and sugar, their beer, gin, and tobacco, towards the\r\nexpenses of a Government which exerts itself rather to injure than\r\nbenefit them, but likewise to the ratepayers of the parish; for it is\r\na necessary consequence, if the shopkeepers have the power to deprive\r\nthe street-dealers of their living whenever the out-of-door tradesmen\r\nare thought to interfere with the business of those indoors (perhaps\r\nby underselling them), that the street-dealers, being unable to live\r\nby their own labour, must betake themselves to the union and live upon\r\nthe labour of the parishioners, and thus the shopkeepers may be said to\r\nenrich themselves at the expense, not only of the poor street-people,\r\nbut likewise of their brother ratepayers.\r\n\r\nNor can it be said that the _Street-Sellers_ are interlopers upon these\r\noccasions, for if ancient custom be referred to, it will be found that\r\nthe Shopkeepers are the real intruders, they having succeeded the\r\nHawkers, who were, in truth, the original distributors of the produce\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nBut though no body of Shopkeepers, nor, indeed, any other class of\r\npeople _individually_, should possess the power to deprive the Hawkers\r\nof what is often the last shift of struggling independence--the sale\r\nof a few goods in the street--still it is evident that the _general_\r\nconvenience of the public must be consulted, and that, were the\r\nStreet-Traders to be allowed the right of pitching in any thoroughfare\r\nthey pleased, many of our principal streets would be blocked up with\r\ncosters’ barrows, and the kerb of Regent-street possibly crowded like\r\nthat of the New Cut, with the hawkers and hucksters that would be sure\r\nto resort thither; while those thoroughfares which, like Fleet-street\r\nand Cheapside, are now almost impassable at certain times of the day,\r\nfrom the increased traffic of the City, would be rendered still more\r\nimpervious by the throngs of street-sellers that the crowd alone would\r\nbe sure to attract to the spot.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, therefore, it becomes necessary that we\r\nshould provide for the vast body of Street-Sellers some authorized\r\nplace of resort, where they might be both entitled and permitted to\r\nobtain an honest living according to Act of Parliament. To think for a\r\nmoment of “putting down” street-trading is to be at once ignorant of\r\nthe numbers and character of the people pursuing it. To pass an Act\r\ndeclaring 50,000 individuals rogues and vagabonds, would be to fill our\r\nprisons or our workhouses with men who would willingly earn their own\r\nliving. Besides, the poor _will_ buy of the poor. Subject the petty\r\ntrader to fine and imprisonment as you please, still the very sympathy\r\nand patronage of the petty purchaser will in this country always call\r\ninto existence a large body of purveyors to the poorer classes. I\r\nwould suggest, therefore, and I do so after much consideration, and\r\nan earnest desire to meet all the difficulties of the case, that a\r\nnumber of “poor men’s markets” be established throughout London, by\r\nthe purchase or rental of plots of ground in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe present street-markets; that a small toll be paid by each of the\r\nStreet-Sellers attending such markets, for the right to vend their\r\ngoods there--that the keeper or beadle of each market be likewise an\r\nInspector of Weights and Measures, and that any hawker found using\r\n“slangs” of any kind, or resorting to any imposition whatever, be\r\nprohibited entering the market for the future--that the conduct and\r\nregulation of the markets be under the direction of a committee\r\nconsisting of an equal number of shareholders, sellers, and working\r\nmen--the latter as representatives of the buyers--and that the surplus\r\nfunds (if any, after paying all expenses, together with a fair interest\r\nto the shareholders of the market) should be devoted to the education\r\nof the children of the hawkers before and after the hours of sale.\r\nThere might also be a penny savings’-bank in connection with each of\r\nthe markets, and a person stationed at the gates on the conclusion of\r\nthe day’s business, to collect all he could from the hawkers as they\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThere are already a sufficient number of poor-markets established at\r\nthe East end of the town--though of a different character, such as\r\nthe Old Clothes Exchange--to prove the practicability of the proposed\r\nplan among even the pettiest traders. And I am convinced, after long\r\ndeliberation, that such institutions could not but tend to produce a\r\nrapid and marked improvement in the character of the London Hawkers.\r\n\r\nThis is the only way evident to me of meeting the evil of our present\r\nstreet-life--an evil which is increasing every day, and which\r\nthreatens, ere long, almost to overwhelm us with its abominations. To\r\nrevile the street-people is stark folly. Their ignorance is no demerit\r\nto them, even as it is no merit to us to know the little that we do.\r\nIf we really wish the people better, let us, I say again, do for them\r\nwhat others have done for us, and without which (humiliating as it may\r\nbe to our pride) we should most assuredly have been as they are. It is\r\nthe continued forgetfulness of this truth--a truth which our wretched\r\nself-conceit is constantly driving from our minds--that prevents our\r\nstirring to improve the condition of these poor people; though, if we\r\nknew but the whole of the facts concerning them, and their sufferings\r\nand feelings, our very fears alone for the safety of the state would\r\nbe sufficient to make us do something in their behalf. I am quite\r\nsatisfied, from all I have seen, that there are thousands in this great\r\nmetropolis ready to rush forth, on the least evidence of a rising of\r\nthe people, to commit the most savage and revolting excesses--men who\r\nhave no knowledge of the government of the country but as an armed\r\ndespotism, preventing their earning their living, and who hate all\r\nlaw, because it is made to appear to them merely as an organised\r\ntyranny--men, too, who have neither religious nor moral principles to\r\nrestrain the exercise of their grossest passions when once roused, and\r\nmen who, from our very neglect of them, are necessarily and essentially\r\nthe dangerous classes, whose existence we either rail at or deplore.\r\n\r\nThe rate of increase among the street-traders it is almost impossible\r\nto arrive at. The population returns afford us no data for the\r\ncalculation, and the street-people themselves are unable to supply the\r\nleast information on the subject; all they can tell us is, that about\r\n20 years ago they took a guinea for every shilling that they get now.\r\nThis heavy reduction of their receipts they attribute to the cheapness\r\nof commodities, and the necessity to carry and sell a greater quantity\r\nof goods in order to get the same profit, as well as to the increase\r\nin the number of street-traders; but when questioned as to the extent\r\nof such increase, their answers are of the vaguest possible kind.\r\nArranging the street-people, however, as we have done, into three\r\ndistinct classes, according to the causes which have led to their\r\ninduction into a street-life, viz., those who are _born_ and _bred_\r\nto the streets--those who _take_ to the streets--and those who are\r\n_driven_ to the streets, it is evident that the main elements of any\r\nextraordinary increase of the street-folk must be sought for among the\r\ntwo latter classes. Among the first the increase will, at the utmost,\r\nbe at the same rate as the ordinary increase of the population--viz.,\r\n1-1/2 per cent. per annum; for the English costermongers and\r\nstreet-traders in general appear to be remarkable rather for the small\r\nthan the large number of their children, so that, even supposing all\r\nthe boys and girls of the street-sellers to be brought up to the\r\nsame mode of life as their father, we could not thus account for any\r\n_enormous_ increase among the street-folk. With those, however, who\r\n_take_ to the streets from the love of a “roving life,” or the desire\r\nto “shake a free leg”--to quote the phrases of the men themselves--or\r\nare _driven_ to the streets from an inability to obtain employment\r\nat the pursuit to which they have been accustomed, the case is far\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThat there is every day a greater difficulty for working men to live\r\nby their labour--either from the paucity of work, or from the scanty\r\nremuneration given for it--surely no one will be disposed to question\r\nwhen every one is crying out that the country is over-populated.\r\nSuch being the case, it is evident that the number of mechanics in\r\nthe streets must be daily augmenting, for, as I have before said,\r\nstreet-trading is the last shift of an unemployed artizan to keep\r\nhimself and his family from the “Union.” The workman out of work,\r\nsooner than starve or go to the parish for relief, takes to making\r\nup and vending on his own account the articles of his craft, whilst\r\nthe underpaid workman, sooner than continue toiling from morning till\r\nmidnight for a bare subsistence, resorts to the easier trade of buying\r\nand selling. Again, even among the less industrious of the working\r\nclasses, the general decline in wages has tended, and is continually\r\ntending, to make their labour more and more irksome to them. There is\r\na cant abroad at the present day, that there is a special pleasure in\r\nindustry, and hence we are taught to regard all those who object to\r\nwork as appertaining to the class of natural vagabonds; but where is\r\nthe man among us that loves labour? for work or labour is merely that\r\nwhich is irksome to perform, and which every man requires a certain\r\namount of remuneration to induce him to perform. If men really loved\r\nwork they would pay to be allowed to do it rather than require to be\r\npaid for doing it. That occupation which is agreeable to us we call\r\namusement, and that and that only which is disagreeable we term labour,\r\nor drudgery, according to the intensity of its irksomeness. Hence as\r\nthe amount of remuneration given by way of inducement to a man to go\r\nthrough a certain amount of work becomes reduced, so does the stimulus\r\nto work become weakened, and this, through the decline of wages, is\r\nwhat is daily taking place among us. Our operatives are continually\r\nceasing to be producers, and passing from the creators of wealth\r\ninto the exchangers or distributors of it; becoming mere tradesmen,\r\nsubsisting on the labour of other people rather than their own, and\r\nso adding to the very non-producers, the great number of whom is the\r\nmain cause of the poverty of those who make all our riches. To teach\r\na people the difficulty of living by labour is to inculcate the most\r\ndangerous of all lessons, and this is what we are daily doing. Our\r\ntrading classes are increasing at a most enormous rate, and so giving\r\nrise to that exceeding competition, and consequently, to that continual\r\nreduction of prices--all of which must ultimately fall upon the working\r\nman. This appears to me to be the main cause of the increase of the\r\nLondon street people, and one for which I candidly confess I see no\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND ARTICLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already treated of the street-commerce in such things as\r\nare presented to the public in the form in which they are to be\r\ncooked, eaten, drank, or used. They have comprised the necessaries,\r\ndelicacies, or luxuries of the street; they have been either the raw\r\nfood or preparations ready cooked or mixed for immediate consumption,\r\nas in the case of the street eatables and drinkables; or else they were\r\nthe proceeds of taste (or its substitute) in art or literature, or of\r\nusefulness or ingenuity in manufacture.\r\n\r\nAll these many objects of street-commerce may be classified in one\r\nwell-known word: they are bought and sold _first-hand_. I have next\r\nto deal with the _second-hand_ sellers of our streets; and in this\r\ndivision perhaps will be found more that is novel, curious, and\r\ninteresting, than in that just completed.\r\n\r\nMr. Babbage, in his “Economy of Machinery and Manufactures,” says,\r\nconcerning the employment of materials of little value: “The worn-out\r\nsaucepan and tin-ware of our kitchens, when beyond the reach of the\r\ntinker’s art, are not utterly worthless. We sometimes meet carts loaded\r\nwith old tin kettles and worn-out iron coal-skuttles traversing our\r\nstreets. These have not yet completed their useful course; the less\r\ncorroded parts are cut into strips, punched with small holes, and\r\nvarnished with a coarse black varnish for the use of the trunk-maker,\r\nwho protects the edges and angles of his boxes with them; the remainder\r\nare conveyed to the manufacturing chemists in the outskirts, who employ\r\nthem in combination with pyroligneous acid, in making a black dye for\r\nthe use of calico-printers.”\r\n\r\nMr. Babbage has here indicated one portion of the nature of the\r\nstreet-trade in second-hand articles--the application of worn-out\r\nmaterials to a new purpose. But this second-hand commerce of the\r\nstreets--for a street-commerce it mainly is, both in selling and\r\nbuying--has a far greater extent than that above indicated, and many\r\nramifications. Under the present head I shall treat only of street\r\n_sellers_, unless when a street _purchase_ may be so intimately\r\nconnected with a street _sale_ that for the better understanding of the\r\nsubject it may be necessary to sketch both. Of the STREET-BUYERS and\r\nthe STREET-FINDERS, or COLLECTORS, both connected with the second-hand\r\ntrade, I shall treat separately.\r\n\r\nIn London, where many, in order to live, struggle to extract a meal\r\nfrom the possession of an article which seems utterly worthless,\r\nnothing must be wasted. Many a thing which in a country town is\r\nkicked by the penniless out of their path even, or examined and left\r\nas meet only for the scavenger’s cart, will in London be snatched\r\nup as a prize; it is money’s worth. A crushed and torn bonnet, for\r\ninstance, or, better still, an old hat, napless, shapeless, crownless,\r\nand brimless, will be picked up in the street, and carefully placed\r\nin a bag with similar things by one class of street-folk--the\r\nSTREET-FINDERS. And to tempt the well-to-do to _sell_ their second-hand\r\ngoods, the street-trader offers the barter of shapely china or shining\r\nglass vessels; or blooming fuchsias or fragrant geraniums for “the\r\nrubbish,” or else, in the spirit of the hero of the fairy tale, he\r\nexchanges, “new lamps for old.”\r\n\r\nOf the street sale of second-hand articles, with all the collateral or\r\nincidental matter bearing immediately on the subject, I shall treat\r\nunder the following heads, or under such heads as really constitute\r\nthe staple of the business, dismissing such as may be trifling or\r\nexceptional. Of these traffickers, then, there are five classes, the\r\nmere enumeration of the objects of their traffic being curious enough:--\r\n\r\n1. _The Street-Sellers of Old Metal Articles_, such as knives, forks,\r\nand butchers’ steels; saws, hammers, pincers, files, screw-drivers,\r\nplanes, chisels, and other tools (more frequently those of the workers\r\nin wood than of other artisans); old scissors and shears; locks,\r\nkeys, and hinges; shovels, fire-irons, trivets, chimney-cranes,\r\nfenders, and fire-guards; warming-pans (but rarely now); flat and\r\nItalian irons, curling-tongs; rings, horse-shoes, and nails; coffee\r\nand tea-pots, urns, trays, and canisters; pewter measures; scales and\r\nweights; bed-screws and keys; candlesticks and snuffers; niggards,\r\ngenerally called niggers (_i. e._, false bottoms for grates); tobacco\r\nand snuff-boxes and spittoons; door-plates, numbers, knockers, and\r\nescutcheons; dog-collars and dog-chains (and other chains); gridirons;\r\nrazors; coffee-mills; lamps; swords and daggers; gun and pistol-barrels\r\nand locks (and occasionally the entire weapon); bronze and cast metal\r\nfigures; table, chair, and sofa castors; bell-pulls and bells; the\r\nlarger buckles and other metal (most frequently brass) articles of\r\nharness furniture; compositors’ sticks (the depositories of the type\r\nin the first instance); the multifarious kinds of tin-wares; stamps;\r\ncork-screws; barrel-taps; ink-stands; a multiplicity of culinary\r\nvessels and of old metal lids; footmen, broken machinery, and parts of\r\nmachinery, as odd wheels, and screws of all sizes, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n2. _The Street-Sellers of Old Linen, Cotton, and Woollen Articles_,\r\nsuch as old sheeting for towels; old curtains of dimity, muslin,\r\ncotton, or moreen; carpeting; blanketing for house-scouring cloths;\r\nticking for beds and pillows; sacking for different purposes, according\r\nto its substance and quality; fringes; and stocking-legs for the supply\r\nof “jobbing worsted,” and for re-footing.\r\n\r\nI may here observe that in the street-trade, second-hand linen\r\nor cotton is often made to pay a double debt. The shirt-collars\r\nsold, sometimes to a considerable extent and very cheap, in the\r\nstreet-markets, are made out of linen which has previously been used in\r\nsome other form; so is it with white waistcoats and other habiliments.\r\nOf the street-folk who vend such wares I shall speak chiefly in the\r\nfourth division of this subject, viz. the second-hand street-sellers of\r\nmiscellaneous articles.\r\n\r\n3. _The Street-Sellers of Old Glass and Crockery_, including the\r\nvariety of bottles, odd, or in sets, or in broken sets; pans, pitchers,\r\nwash-hand basins, and other crockery utensils; china ornaments;\r\npier, convex, and toilet glasses (often without the frames); pocket\r\nink-bottles; wine, beer, and liqueur glasses; decanters; glass\r\nfish-bowls (occasionally); salt-cellars; sugar-basins; and lamp and gas\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\n4. _The Street-Sellers of Miscellaneous Articles._ These are such as\r\ncannot properly be classed under any of the three preceding heads,\r\nand include a mass of miscellaneous commodities: Accordions and other\r\nmusical instruments; brushes of all descriptions; shaving-boxes\r\nand razor-strops; baskets of many kinds; stuffed birds, with and\r\nwithout frames; pictures, with and without frames; desks, work-boxes,\r\ntea-caddies, and many articles of old furniture; boot-jacks and hooks;\r\nshoe-horns; cartouche-boxes; pocket and opera glasses; rules, and\r\nmeasures in frames; backgammon, and chess or draught boards and men,\r\nand dice; boxes of dominoes; cribbage-boards and boxes, sometimes\r\nwith old packs of cards; pope-boards (boards used in playing the\r\ngame of “Pope,” or “Pope Joan,” though rarely seen now); “fish,” or\r\ncard counters of bone, ivory, or mother of pearl (an equal rarity);\r\nmicroscopes (occasionally); an extensive variety of broken or faded\r\nthings, new or long kept, such as magic-lanterns, dissected maps or\r\nhistories, &c., from the toy warehouses and shops; Dutch clocks;\r\nbarometers; wooden trays; shells; music and books (the latter being\r\noften odd volumes of old novels); tee-totums, and similar playthings;\r\nladies’ head-combs; umbrellas and parasols; fishing-rods and nets;\r\nreins, and other parts of cart, gig, and “two-horse” harness; boxes\r\nfull of “odds and ends” of old leather, such as water-pipes; and a mass\r\nof imperfect metal things, which had “better be described,” said an old\r\ndealer, “as from a needle to an anchor.”\r\n\r\n5. _The Street-Sellers of Old Apparel_, including the body habiliments,\r\nconstituting alike men’s, women’s, boys’, girls’, and infants’ attire:\r\nas well as hats, caps, gloves, belts, and stockings; shirts and\r\nshirt-fronts (“dickeys”); handkerchiefs, stocks, and neck-ties; furs,\r\nsuch as victorines, boas, tippets, and edgings; beavers and bonnets;\r\nand the other several, and sometimes not easily describable, articles\r\nwhich constitute female fashionable or ordinary wear.\r\n\r\nI may here observe, that of the wares which once formed a portion of\r\nthe stock of the street-sellers of the fourth and fifth divisions,\r\nbut which are now no longer objects of street sale, were, till within\r\nthe last few years, fans; back and shoulder boards (to make girls\r\ngrow straight!); several things at one time thought indispensable to\r\nevery well-nurtured child, such as a coral and bells; belts, sashes,\r\nscabbards, epaulettes, feathers or plumes, hard leather stocks, and\r\nother indications of the volunteer, militia, and general military\r\nspirit of the early part of the present century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding immediately with my subject, I may say a few words\r\nconcerning what is, in the estimation of some, a _second-hand_ matter.\r\nI allude to the many uses to which that which is regarded, and indeed\r\ntermed, “offal,” or “refuse,” or “waste,” is put in a populous city.\r\nThis may be evidenced in the multiform uses to which the “offal” of\r\nthe animals which are slaughtered for our use are put. It is still\r\nmore curiously shown in the uses of the offal of the animals which are\r\nkilled, not for our use, but for that of our dogs and cats; and to this\r\npart of the subject I shall more especially confine the remarks I have\r\nto make. My observations on the uses of other waste articles will be\r\nfound in another place.\r\n\r\nWhat in the butcher’s trade is considered the offal of a bullock, was\r\nexplained by Mr. Deputy Hicks, before the last Select Committee of\r\nthe House of Commons on Smithfield Market: “The carcass,” he said,\r\n“as it hangs clear of everything else, is the carcass, and all else\r\nconstitutes the offal.”\r\n\r\nThe carcass may be briefly termed the four quarters, whereas the offal\r\nthen comprises the hide, which in the average-sized bullock that is\r\nslaughtered in London is worth 12_s._; but with the hide are sold the\r\nhorns, which are worth about 10_d._ to the comb-makers, who use them\r\nto make their “tortoise-shell” articles, and for similar purposes.\r\nThe hoofs are worth 2_d._ to the glue-makers, or prussiate of potash\r\nmanufacturers. What “comes out of a bullock,” to use the trade term,\r\nis the liver, the lights (or lungs), the stomach, the intestinal canal\r\n(sometimes 36 yards when extended), and the gall duct. These portions,\r\nwith the legs (called “feet” in the trade), form what is styled the\r\ntripe-man’s portion, and are disposed of to him by the butcher for\r\n5_s._ 6_d._ Separately, the value of the liver is 8_d._, of the lights,\r\n6_d._ (both for dogs’-meat), and of the legs which are worked into\r\ntooth-brush handles, dominoes, &c., 1_s._ The remaining 3_s._ 4_d._ is\r\nthe worth of the other portion. The heart averages rather more than\r\n1_s._; the kidneys the same; the head, 1_s._ 9_d._; the blood (which\r\nis “let down the drain” in all but the larger slaughtering houses)\r\n1-1/2_d._ (being 3_d._ for 9 gallons); the tallow (7 stone) 14_s._; and\r\nthe tail, I was told, “from nothing to 2_s._,” averaging about 6_d._;\r\nthe tongue, 2_s._ 6_d._ Thus the offal sells, altogether, first hand,\r\nfor 1_l._ 18_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nI will now show the uses to which what is far more decidedly pronounced\r\n“offal,” and what is much more “second-hand” in popular estimation,\r\nviz., a dead horse, is put, and even a dead horse’s offal, and I will\r\nthen show the difference in this curious trade between the Parisian and\r\nLondon horse offal.\r\n\r\nThe greatest horse-slaughtering establishments in France are at\r\nMontfaucon, a short distance from the capital. When the animal has been\r\nkilled, it is “cut up,” and the choicer portions of the flesh are eaten\r\nby the work-people of the establishment, and by the hangers-on and\r\njobbers who haunt the locality of such places, and are often men of a\r\ndesperate character. The rest of the carcass is sold for the feeding of\r\ndogs, cats, pigs, and poultry, a portion being also devoted to purposes\r\nof manure. The flesh on a horse of average size and fatness is 350\r\nlbs., which sells for 1_l._ 12_s._ 6_d._ But this is only one of the\r\nuses of the dead animal.\r\n\r\nThe skin is sold to a tanner for 10_s._ 6_d._ The hoofs to a\r\nmanufacturer of sal ammonia, or similar preparations, or of Prussian\r\nblue, or to a comb or toy-maker, for 1_s._ 4_d._ The old shoes and the\r\nshoe-nails are worth 2-1/2_d._ The hair of the mane and tail realizes\r\n1-1/2_d._ The tendons are disposed of, either fresh or dried, to\r\nglue-makers for 3_d._--a pound of dried tendons (separated from the\r\nmuscles) being about the average per horse. The bones are bought by\r\nthe turners, cutlers, fan-makers, and the makers of ivory black and sal\r\nammoniac, 90 lbs. being an average weight of the animal’s bones, and\r\nrealizing 2_s._ The intestines wrought into the different preparations\r\nrequired of the gut-makers, or for manure, are worth 2_d._\r\n\r\nThe blood is used by the sugar-refiners, and by the fatteners of\r\npoultry, pigeons, and turkeys (which devour it greedily), or else for\r\nmanure. When required for manure it is dried--20 lbs. of dried blood,\r\nwhich is the average weight, being worth 1_s._ 9_d._ The fat is removed\r\nfrom the carcass and melted down. It is in demand for the making of\r\ngas, of soap, and (when very fine) of--bear’s grease; also for the\r\ndubbing or grease applied to harness and to shoe-leather. This fat when\r\nconsumed in lamps communicates a greater portion of heat than does\r\noil, and is therefore preferred by the makers of glass toys, and by\r\nenamellers and polishers. A horse at Montfaucon has been known to yield\r\n60 lbs. of fat, but this is an extreme case; a yield of 12 lbs. is the\r\nproduce of a horse in fair condition, but at these slaughterhouses\r\nthere are so many lean and sorry jades that 8 lbs. may be taken as\r\nan average of fat, and at a value of 6_d._ per lb. Nor does the list\r\nend here; the dead and putrid flesh is made to teem with life, and to\r\nproduce food for other living creatures. A pile of pieces of flesh,\r\nsix inches in height, layer on layer, is slightly covered with hay or\r\nstraw; the flies soon deposit their eggs in the attractive matter,\r\nand thus maggots are bred, the most of which are used as food for\r\npheasants, and in a smaller degree of domestic fowls, and as baits for\r\nfish. These maggots give, or are supposed to give, a “game flavour” to\r\npoultry, and a very “high” flavour to pheasants. One horse’s flesh thus\r\nproduces maggots worth 1_s._ 5_d._ The total amount, then, realized on\r\nthe dead horse, which may cost 10_s._ 6_d._, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n                           £  _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  The flesh                1   12   6\r\n  The skin                 0   10   6\r\n  The hoofs                0    1   4\r\n  The shoes and nails      0    0   2-1/2\r\n  The mane and tail        0    0   1-1/2\r\n  The tendons              0    0   3\r\n  The bones                0    2   0\r\n  The intestines           0    0   2\r\n  The blood                0    1   9\r\n  The fat                  0    4   0\r\n  The maggots              0    1   5\r\n                          -----------\r\n                          £2   14   3\r\n\r\nThe carcass of a French horse is also made available in another\r\nway, and which relates to a subject I have lately treated of--the\r\ndestruction of rats; but this is not a regularly-accruing emolument.\r\nMontfaucon swarms with rats, and to kill them the carcass of a horse\r\nis placed in a room, into which the rats gain access through openings\r\nin the floor contrived for the purpose. At night the rats are lured by\r\ntheir keenness of scent to the room, and lured in numbers; the openings\r\nare then closed, and they are prisoners. In one room 16,000 were killed\r\nin four weeks. The Paris furriers gave from three to four francs for\r\n100 skins, so that, taking the average at 3_s._ of our money, 16,000\r\nrat-skins would return 24_l._\r\n\r\nIn London the uses of the dead horse’s flesh, bones, blood, &c., are\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nHorse-flesh is not--as yet--a portion of human food in this country. In\r\na recent parliamentary inquiry, witnesses were examined as to whether\r\nhorse-flesh was used by the sausage-makers. There was some presumption\r\nthat such might be the case, but no direct evidence. I found, however,\r\namong butchers who had the best means of knowing, a strong conviction\r\nthat such _was_ the case. One highly-respectable tradesman told me\r\nhe was as certain of it as that it was the month of June, though, if\r\ncalled upon to produce legal evidence proving either that such was the\r\nsausage-makers’ practice, or that this _was_ the month of June, he\r\nmight fail in both instances.\r\n\r\nI found among street-people who dealt in provisions a strong, or, at\r\nany rate, a strongly-expressed, opinion that the tongues, kidneys, and\r\nhearts of horses were sold as those of oxen. One man told me, somewhat\r\ntriumphantly, as a result of his ingenuity in deduction, that he had\r\nthoughts at one time of trying to establish himself in a cats’-meat\r\nwalk, and made inquiries into the nature of the calling: “I’m satisfied\r\nthe ’osses’ ’arts,” he said, “is sold for beastesses’; ’cause you see,\r\nsir, there’s nothing as ’ud be better liked for favourite cats and pet\r\ndogs, than a nice piece of ’art, but ven do you see the ’osses’ ’arts\r\non a barrow? If they don’t go to the cats, vere does they go to? Vy, to\r\nthe Christians.”\r\n\r\nI am assured, however, by tradesmen whose interest (to say nothing of\r\nother considerations) would probably make them glad to expose such\r\npractices, that this substitution of the equine for the bovine heart is\r\nnot attempted, and is hardly possible. The bullock’s heart, kidneys,\r\nand tongue, are so different in shape (the heart, more especially), and\r\nin the colour of the fat, while the rough tip of the ox’s tongue is not\r\nfound in that of the horse, that this second-hand, or offal kind of\r\nanimal food could not be palmed off upon any one who had ever purchased\r\nthe heart, kidneys, or tongue of an ox. “If the horse’s tongue be used\r\nas a substitute for that of any other,” said one butcher to me, “it\r\nis for the dried reindeer’s--a savoury dish for the breakfast table!”\r\nSince writing the above, I have had convincing proof given me that the\r\nhorses’ tongues are cured and sold as “neats.” The heart and kidneys\r\nare also palmed, I find, for those of oxen!! Thus, in one respect,\r\nthere is a material difference between the usages, in respect of this\r\nfood, between Paris and London.\r\n\r\nOne tradesman, in a large way of business--with many injunctions that\r\nI should make no allusion that might lead to his being known, as\r\nhe said it might be his ruin, even though he never slaughtered the\r\nmeat he sold, but was, in fact, a dead salesman or a vendor of meat\r\nconsigned to him--one tradesman, I say, told me that he fancied there\r\nwas an _unreasonable_ objection to the eating of horse-flesh among us.\r\nThe horse was quite as dainty in his food as the ox, he was quite\r\nas graminivorous, and shrunk more, from a nicer sense of smell, from\r\nanything pertaining to a contact with animal food than did the ox. The\r\nprincipal objection lies in the number of diseased horses sold at the\r\nknackers. My informant reasoned only from analogy, as he had never\r\ntasted horse-flesh; but a great-uncle of his, he told me, had relished\r\nit highly in the peninsular war.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which a horse’s carcass are put in London are these:--The\r\nskin, for tanning, sells for 6_s._ as a low average; the hoofs, for\r\nglue, are worth 2_d._; the shoes and nails, 1-1/2_d._; the mane and\r\ntail, 1-1/2_d._; the bones, which in London (as it was described to\r\nme) are “cracked up” for manure, bring 1_s._ 6_d._; the fat is melted\r\ndown and used for cart-grease and common harness oil; one person\r\nacquainted with the trade thought that the average yield of fat was 10\r\nlbs. per horse (“taking it low”), another that it was 12 lbs. (“taking\r\nit square”), so that if 11 lbs. be accepted as an average, the fat,\r\nat 2_d._ per lb., would realize 1_s._ 10_d._ Of the tendons no use\r\nis made; of the blood none; and no maggots are reared upon putrid\r\nhorse-flesh, but a butcher, who had been twenty years a farmer also,\r\ntold me that he knew from experience that there was nothing so good as\r\nmaggots for the fattening of poultry, and he thought, from what I told\r\nhim of maggot-breeding in Montfaucon, that we were _behind_ the French\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\nThus the English dead horse--the vendor receiving on an average 1_l._\r\nfrom the knacker,--realizes the following amount, without including the\r\nknacker’s profit in disposing of the flesh to the cats’-meat man; but\r\ncomputing it merely at 2_l._ we have the subjoined receipts:--\r\n\r\n                                         £  _s._  _d._\r\n  The flesh (averaging 2 cwt.,\r\n    sold at 2-1/2_d._ per lb.)           2    0     0\r\n  The skin                               0    6     0\r\n  The hoofs                              0    0     2\r\n  The shoes and nails                    0    0     1-1/2\r\n  The bones                              0    1     6\r\n  The fat                                0    1    10\r\n  The tendons                            0    0     0\r\n  The tongue, &c.                       ----------------- ?\r\n  The blood                              0    0     0\r\n  The intestines                         0    0     0\r\n                                        -----------------\r\n                                        £2    9     7-1/2\r\n\r\nThe French dead horse, then, is made a source of nearly 5_s._\r\nhigher receipt than the English. On my inquiring the reason of this\r\ndifference, and why the blood, &c., were not made available, I was\r\ntold that the demand by the Prussian blue manufacturers and the sugar\r\nrefiners was so fully supplied, and over-supplied, from the great\r\ncattle slaughter-houses, that the private butchers, for the trifling\r\nsum to be gained, let the blood be wasted. One bullock slaughterer\r\nin Fox and Knot-yard, who kills 180 cattle in a week, receives only\r\n1_l._ for the blood of the whole number, which is received in a well\r\nin the slaughter-house. The amount paid for blood a few years back was\r\nmore than double its present rate. Under these circumstances, I was\r\ntold, it would be useless trying to turn the wasted offal of a horse\r\nto any profitable purpose. There is, I am told, on an average, 1000\r\nhorses slaughtered every week in London, and this, at 2_l._ 10_s._\r\neach animal, would make the value of the dead horses of the metropolis\r\namount to 130,000_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nWere it not that I might be dwelling too long on the subject, I might\r\npoint out how the offal of the skins was made to subserve other\r\npurposes from the Bermondsey tan-yards; and how the parings and\r\nscrapings went to the makers of glue and size, and the hair to the\r\nbuilders to mix with lime, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nI may instance another thing in which the worth of what in many places\r\nis valueless refuse is exemplified, in the matter of “waste,” as\r\nwaste paper is always called in the trade. Paper in all its glossiest\r\nfreshness is but a reproduction of what had become in some measure\r\n“waste,” viz. the rags of the cotton or linen fabric after serving\r\ntheir original purpose. There is a body of men in London who occupy\r\nthemselves entirely in collecting waste paper. It is no matter of what\r\nkind; a small prayer-book, a once perfumed and welcome love-note,\r\nlawyers’ or tailors’ bills, acts of parliament, and double sheets of\r\nthe _Times_, form portions of the waste dealer’s stock. Tons upon tons\r\nare thus consumed yearly. Books of every description are ingredients\r\nof this waste, and in every language; modern poems or pamphlets and\r\nold romances (perfect or imperfect), Shakespeare, Molière, Bibles,\r\nmusic, histories, stories, magazines, tracts to convert the heathen\r\nor to prove how easily and how immensely our national and individual\r\nwealth might be enhanced, the prospectuses of a thousand companies,\r\neach certain to prove a mine of wealth, schemes to pay off the national\r\ndebt, or recommendations to wipe it off, auctioneers’ catalogues and\r\nlong-kept letters, children’s copy-books and last century ledgers,\r\nprinted effusions which have progressed no further than the unfolded\r\nsheets, uncut works and books mouldy from age--all these things are\r\nfound in the insatiate bag of the waste collector, who of late has\r\nbeen worried because he could not supply enough! “I don’t know how it\r\nis, sir,” said one waste collector, with whom I had some conversation\r\non the subject of street-sold books, with which business he was also\r\nconnected, “I can’t make it out, but paper gets scarcer or else I’m out\r\nof luck. Just at this time my family and me really couldn’t live on my\r\nwaste if we had to depend entirely upon it.”\r\n\r\nI am assured that in no place in the world is this traffic carried on\r\nto anything approaching the extent that it is in London. When I treat\r\nof the street-buyers I shall have some curious information to publish\r\non the subject. I do but allude to it here as one strongly illustrative\r\nof “second-hand” appliances.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND METAL ARTICLES.\r\n\r\nI have in the preceding remarks specified the wares sold by the vendors\r\nof the second-hand articles of metal manufacture, or (as they are\r\ncalled in the streets) the “old metal” men. The several articles I\r\nhave specified may never be all found at one time upon one stall, but\r\nthey are all found on the respective stalls. “Aye, sir,” said one old\r\nman whom I conversed with, “and there’s more things every now and then\r\ncomes to the stalls, and there used to be still more when I were young,\r\nbut I can’t call them all to mind, for times is worse with me, and so\r\nmy memory fails. But there used to be a good many bayonets, and iron\r\ntinder-boxes, and steels for striking lights; I can remember them.”\r\n\r\nSome of the sellers have strong heavy barrows, which they wheel from\r\nstreet to street. As this requires a considerable exertion of strength,\r\nsuch part of the trade is carried on by strong men, generally of the\r\ncostermongering class. The weight to be propelled is about 300 lbs. Of\r\nthis class there are now a few, rarely more than half-a-dozen, who sell\r\non commission in the way I have described concerning the swag-barrowmen.\r\n\r\nThese are the “old metal swags” of street classification, but their\r\nremuneration is less fixed than that of the other swag-barrowmen. It is\r\nsometimes a quarter, sometimes a third, and sometimes even a half of\r\nthe amount taken. The men carrying on this traffic are the servants of\r\nthe marine-store dealers, or vendors of old metal articles, who keep\r\nshops. If one of these people be “lumbered up,” that is, if he find\r\nhis stock increase too rapidly, he furnishes a barrow, and sends a man\r\ninto the streets with it, to sell what the shopkeeper may find to be\r\nexcessive. Sometimes if the tradesman can gain only the merest trifle\r\nmore than he could gain from the people who buy for the melting-pot, he\r\nis satisfied.\r\n\r\nThere is, or perhaps was, an opinion prevalent that the street “old\r\nmetals” in this way of business got rid of stolen goods in such a\r\nmanner as the readiest mode of sale, some of which were purposely\r\nrusted, and sold at almost any price, so that they brought but a profit\r\nto the “fence,” whose payment to the thief was little more than the\r\nprice of old metal at the foundry. I understand, however, that this\r\ncourse is not now pursued, nor is it likely that it ever was pursued to\r\nany extent. The street-seller is directly under the eye of the police,\r\nand when there is a search for stolen goods, it is not very likely that\r\nthey would be paraded, however battered or rusted for the purpose,\r\nbefore men who possessed descriptions of all goods stolen. Until the\r\nestablishment of the present system of police, this might have been\r\nan occasional practice. One street-seller had even heard, and he “had\r\nit from the man what did it,” that a last-maker’s shop was some years\r\nback broken into in the expectation that money would be met with, but\r\nnone was found; and as the thieves could not bring away such heavy\r\nlumbering things as lasts, they cursed their ill-luck, and brought\r\naway such tools as they could stow about their persons, and cover with\r\ntheir loose great coats. These were the large knives, fixed to swivels,\r\nand resembling a small scythe, used by the artizan to rough hew the\r\nblock of beech-wood; and a variety of excellent rasps and files (for\r\nthey must be of the best), necessary for the completion of the last.\r\nThese very tools were, in ten days after the robbery, sold from a\r\nstreet-barrow.\r\n\r\nThe second-hand metal goods are sold from stalls as well as from\r\nbarrows, and these stalls are often tended by women whose husbands may\r\nbe in some other branch of street-commerce. One of these stalls I saw\r\nin the care of a stout elderly Jewess, who was fast asleep, nodding\r\nover her locks and keys. She was awakened by the passing policeman,\r\nlest her stock should be pilfered by the boys: “Come, wake up, mother,\r\nand shake yourself,” he said, “I shall catch a weazel asleep next.”\r\n\r\nSome of these barrows and stalls are heaped with the goods, and some\r\nare very scantily supplied, but the barrows are by far the best\r\nstocked. Many of them (especially the swag) look like collections of\r\nthe different stages of rust, from its incipient spots to its full\r\npossession of the entire metal. But amongst these seemingly useless\r\nthings there is a gleam of brass or plated ware. On one barrow I saw an\r\nold brass door-plate, on which was engraven the name of a late learned\r\njudge, Baron B----; another had formerly announced the residence of a\r\ndignitary of the church, the Rev. Mr. ----.\r\n\r\nThe second-hand metal-sellers are to be seen in all the street-markets,\r\nespecially on the Saturday nights; also in Poplar, Limehouse, and the\r\nCommercial-road, in Golden-lane, and in Old-street and Old-street-road,\r\nSt. Luke’s, in Hoxton and Shoreditch, in the Westminster Broadway,\r\nand the Whitechapel-road, in Rosemary-lane, and in the district\r\nwhere perhaps every street calling is pursued, but where some\r\nspecial street-trades seem peculiar to the genius of the place, in\r\nPetticoat-lane. A person unacquainted with the last-named locality may\r\nhave formed an opinion that Petticoat-lane is merely a lane or street.\r\nBut Petticoat-lane gives its name to a little district. It embraces\r\nSandys-row, Artillery-passage, Artillery-lane, Frying-pan-alley,\r\nCatherine Wheel-alley, Tripe-yard, Fisher’s-alley, Wentworth-street,\r\nHarper’s-alley, Marlborough-court, Broad-place, Providence-place,\r\nEllison-street, Swan-court, Little Love-court, Hutchinson-street,\r\nLittle Middlesex-street, Hebrew-place, Boar’s-head-yard,\r\nBlack-horse-yard, Middlesex-street, Stoney-lane, Meeting-house-yard,\r\nGravel-lane, White-street, Cutler-street, and Borer’s-lane, until the\r\nwayfarer emerges into what appears the repose and spaciousness of\r\nDevonshire-square, Bishopsgate-street, up Borer’s-lane, or into what\r\nin the contrast really looks like the aristocratic thoroughfare of the\r\nAldgate High-street, down Middlesex-street; or into Houndsditch through\r\nthe halls of the Old Clothes Exchange.\r\n\r\nAll these narrow streets, lanes, rows, passages, alleys, yards, courts,\r\nand places, are the sites of the street-trade carried on in this\r\nquarter. The whole neighbourhood rings with street cries, many uttered\r\nin those strange east-end Jewish tones which do not sound like English.\r\nMixed with the incessant invitations to buy Hebrew dainties, or the\r\n“sheepest pargains,” is occasionally heard the guttural utterance\r\nof the Erse tongue, for the “native Irish,” as they are sometimes\r\ncalled, are in possession of some portion of the street-traffic of\r\nPetticoat-lane, the original Rag Fair. The savour of the place is\r\nmoreover peculiar. There is fresh fish, and dried fish, and fish being\r\nfried in a style peculiar to the Jews; there is the fustiness of old\r\nclothes; there is the odour from the pans on which (still in the Jewish\r\nfashion) frizzle and hiss pieces of meat and onions; puddings are\r\nboiling and enveloped in steam; cakes with strange names are hot from\r\nthe oven; tubs of big pickled cucumbers or of onions give a sort of\r\nacidity to the atmosphere; lemons and oranges abound; and altogether\r\nthe scene is not only such as can only be seen in London, but only such\r\nas can be seen in this one part of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nWhen I treat of the street-Jews, I shall have information highly\r\ncurious to communicate, and when I come to the fifth division of my\r\npresent subject, I shall more particularly describe Petticoat-lane, as\r\nthe head-quarters of the second-hand clothes business.\r\n\r\nI have here alluded to the character of this quarter as being one\r\nmuch resorted to formerly, and still largely used by the sellers of\r\nsecond-hand metal goods. Here I was informed that a strong-built man,\r\nknown as Jack, or (appropriately enough) as Iron Jack, had, until\r\nhis death six or seven years ago, one of the best-stocked barrows in\r\nLondon. This, in spite of remonstrances, and by a powerful exercise of\r\nhis strength, the man lifted, as it were, on to the narrow foot-path,\r\nand every passer-by had his attention directed almost perforce to the\r\ncontents of the barrow, for he must make a “_detour_” to advance on\r\nhis way. One of this man’s favourite pitches was close to the lofty\r\nwalls of what, before the change in their charter, was one of the\r\nEast India Company’s vast warehouses. The contrast to any one who\r\nindulged a thought on the subject--and there is great food for thought\r\nin Petticoat-lane--was striking enough. Here towered the store-house\r\nof costly teas, and silks, and spices, and indigo; while at its foot\r\nwas carried on the most minute, and apparently worthless of all\r\nstreet-trades, rusty screws and nails, such as only few would care to\r\npick up in the street, being objects of earnest bargaining!\r\n\r\nAn experienced man in the business, who thought he was “turned 50, or\r\nsomewhere about that,” gave me the following account of his trade, his\r\ncustomers, &c.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in most street-trades,” he said, “and was born to it, like,\r\nfor my mother was a rag-gatherer--not a bad business once--and I helped\r\nher. I never saw my father, but he was a soldier, and it’s supposed\r\nlost his life in foreign parts. No, I don’t remember ever having heard\r\nwhat foreign parts, and it don’t matter. Well, perhaps, this is about\r\nas tidy a trade for a bit of bread as any that’s going now. Perhaps\r\nselling fish may be better, but that’s to a man what knows fish well.\r\nI can’t say I ever did. I’m more a dab at cooking it (with a laugh). I\r\nlike a bloater best on what’s an Irish gridiron. Do you know what that\r\nis, sir? I know, though I’m not Irish, but I married an Irish wife, and\r\nas good a woman as ever was a wife. It’s done on the tongs, sir, laid\r\nacross the fire, and the bloater’s laid across the tongs. Some says\r\nit’s best turned and turned very quick on the coals themselves, but\r\nthe tongs is best, for you can raise or lower.” [My informant seemed\r\ninterested in his account of this and other modes of cookery, which I\r\nneed not detail.] “This is really a very trying trade. O, I mean it\r\ntries a man’s patience so. Why, it was in Easter week a man dressed\r\nlike a gentleman--but I don’t think he was a real gentleman--looked\r\nout some bolts, and a hammer head, and other things, odds and ends,\r\nand they came to 10-1/2_d._ He said he’d give 6_d._ ‘Sixpence!’ says\r\nI; ‘why d’ you think I stole ’em?’ ‘Well,’ says he, ‘if I didn’t think\r\nyou’d stole ’em, I shouldn’t have come to _you_.’ I don’t think he was\r\njoking. Well, sir, we got to high words, and I said, ‘Then I’m d--d\r\nif you have them for less than 1_s._’ And a bit of a crowd began to\r\ngather, they was most boys, but the p’liceman came up, as slow as you\r\nplease, and so my friend flings down 1_s._, and puts the things in his\r\npocket and marches off, with a few boys to keep him company. That’s the\r\nway one’s temper’s tried. Well, it’s hard to say what sells best. A\r\nlatch-lock and keys goes off quick. I’ve had them from 2_d._ to 6_d._;\r\nbut it’s only the lower-priced things as sells now in any trade. Bolts\r\nis a fairish stock, and so is all sorts of tools. Well, not saws so\r\nmuch as such things as screwdrivers, or hammers, or choppers, or tools\r\nthat if they’re rusty people can clean up theirselves. Saws ain’t so\r\neasy to manage; bed-keys is good. No, I don’t clean the metal up unless\r\nit’s very bad; I think things don’t sell so well that way. People’s\r\njealous that they’re just done up on purpose to deceive, though they\r\nmay cost only 1_d._ or 2_d._ There’s that cheese-cutter now, it’s\r\ngetting rustier and there’ll be very likely a better chance to sell it.\r\nThis is how it is, sir, I know. You see if a man’s going to buy old\r\nmetal, and he sees it all rough and rusty, he says to himself, ‘Well,\r\nthere’s no gammon about it; I can just see what it is.’ Then folks\r\nlike to clean up a thing theirselves, and it’s as if it was something\r\nmade from their own cleverness. That was just my feeling, sir, when\r\nI bought old metals for my own use, before I was in the trade, and I\r\ngoes by that. O, working people’s by far my best customers. Many of\r\n’em’s very fond of jobbing about their rooms or their houses, and they\r\ncome to such as me. Then a many has fancies for pigeons, or rabbits,\r\nor poultry, or dogs, and they mostly make up the places for them\r\ntheirselves, and as money’s an object, why them sort of fancy people\r\nbuys hinges, and locks, and screws, and hammers, and what they want of\r\nme. A clever mechanic can turn his hand to most things that he wants\r\nfor his own use. I know a shoemaker that makes beautiful rabbit-hutches\r\nand sells them along with his prize cattle, as I calls his great big\r\nlong-eared rabbits. Perhaps I take 2_s._ 6_d._ or 3_s._ a day, and it’s\r\nabout half profit. Yes, this time of the year I make good 10_s._ 6_d._\r\na week, but in winter not 1_s._ a day. That would be very poor pickings\r\nfor two people to live on, and I can’t do without my drop of beer, but\r\nmy wife has constant work with a first-rate laundress at Mile End, and\r\nso we rub on, for we’ve no family living.”\r\n\r\nThis informant told me further of the way in which the old metal stocks\r\nsold in the streets were provided; but that branch of the subject\r\nrelates to street-buying. Some of the street-sellers, however, buy\r\ntheir stocks of the shopkeepers.\r\n\r\nI find a difficulty in estimating the number of the second-hand\r\nmetal-ware street-sellers. Many of the stalls or barrows are the\r\nproperty of the marine-store shopkeepers, or old metal dealers (marine\r\nstores being about the only things the marine-store men do not sell),\r\nand these are generally placed near the shop, being indeed a portion\r\nof its contents out of doors. Some of the marine-store men (a class of\r\ntraders, by the by, not superior to street-sellers, making no “odious”\r\ncomparison as to the honesty of the two), when they have purchased\r\nlargely--the refuse iron for instance after a house has been pulled\r\ndown--establish two or three pitches in the street, confiding the\r\nstalls or barrows to their wives and children. I was told by several\r\nin the trade that there were 200 old metal sellers in the streets, but\r\nfrom the best information at my command not more than 50 appear to be\r\nstrictly _street_-sellers, unconnected with shop-keeping. Estimating\r\na weekly receipt, per individual, of 15_s._ (half being profit), the\r\nyearly street outlay among this body alone amounts to 1950_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND METAL TRAYS, &c.\r\n\r\nThere are still some few portions of the old metal trade in the streets\r\nwhich require specific mention.\r\n\r\nAmong these is the sale of second-hand trays, occasionally with such\r\nthings as bread-baskets. Instead of these wares, however, being matters\r\nof daily traffic, they are offered in the streets only at intervals,\r\nand generally on the Saturday and Monday evenings, while a few are\r\nhawked to public-houses. An Irishman, a rather melancholy looking\r\nman, but possessed of some humour, gave me the following account. His\r\ndress was a worn suit, such as masons work in; but I have seldom seen\r\nso coarse, and never on an Irishman of his class, except on a Sunday,\r\nso clean a shirt, and he made as free a display of it as if it were\r\nthe choicest cambric. He washed it, he told me, with his own hands,\r\nas he had neither wife, nor mother, nor sister. “I was a cow-keeper’s\r\nman, your honour,” he said, “and he sent milk to Dublin. I thought I\r\nmight do betthur, and I got to Liverpool, and walked here. Have I done\r\nbetthur, is it? Sorry a betthur. Would I like to returren to Dublin?\r\nWell, perhaps, plaze God, I’ll do betthur here yit. I’ve sould a power\r\nof different things in the sthreets, but I’m off for counthry work\r\nnow. I have a few therrays left if your honour wants such a thing. I\r\nfirst sould a few for a man I lodged along wid in Kent-street, when\r\nhe was sick, and so I got to know the therrade. He tould me to say,\r\nand it’s the therruth, if anybody said, ‘They’re only second-hand,’\r\nthat they was all the betthur for that, for if they hadn’t been real\r\ngood therrays at first, they would niver have lived to be second-hand\r\nones. I calls the bigghur therrays butlers, and the smhaller, waithers.\r\nIt’s a poor therrade. One woman’ll say, ‘Pooh! ould-fashioned things.’\r\n‘Will, thin, ma’am,’ I’ll say, ‘a good thing like this is niver\r\nould-fashioned, no more than the bhutiful mate and berrid, and the\r\nbhutiful new praties a coming in, that you’ll be atin off of it, and\r\nthratin’ your husband to, God save him. No lady iver goes to supper\r\nwidout her therray.’ Yes, indeed, thin, and it is a poor therrade. It’s\r\nthe bhutiful therrays I’ve sould for 6_d._ I buys them of a shop which\r\ndales in sich things. The perrofit! Sorry a perrofit is there in it at\r\nall at all; but I thries to make 4_d._ out of 1_s._ If I makes 6_d._ of\r\na night it’s good worruk.”\r\n\r\nThese trays are usually carried under the arm, and are sometimes piled\r\non a stool or small stand, in a street market. The prices are from\r\n2_d._ to 10_d._, sometimes 1_s._ The stronger descriptions are sold to\r\nstreet-sellers to display their goods upon, as much as to any other\r\nclass. Women and children occasionally sell them, but it is one of the\r\ncallings which seems to be disappearing from the streets. From two men,\r\nwho were familiar with this and other second-hand trades, I heard the\r\nfollowing reasons assigned for the decadence. One man thought it was\r\nowing to “swag-trays” being got up so common and so cheap, but to look\r\n“stunning well,” at least as long as the shininess lasted. The other\r\ncontended that poor working people had enough to do now-a-days to get\r\nsomething to eat, without thinking of a tray to put it on.\r\n\r\nIf 20 persons, and that I am told is about the number of sellers, take\r\nin the one or two nights’ sale 4_s._ a week each, on second-hand trays\r\n(33 per cent. being the rate of profit), the street expenditure is\r\n208_l._ in a year.\r\n\r\nIn other second-hand metal articles there is now and then a separate\r\ntrade. Two or three sets of small _fire-irons_ may be offered in a\r\nstreet-market on a Saturday night; or a small stock of _flat and\r\nItalian irons_ for the laundresses, who work cheap and must buy\r\nsecond-hand; or a _collection of tools_ in the same way; but these\r\nare accidental sales, and are but ramifications from the general “old\r\nmetal” trade that I have described. Perhaps, in the sale of these\r\nsecond-hand articles, 20 people may be regularly employed, and 300_l._\r\nyearly may be taken.\r\n\r\nIn Petticoat-lane, Rosemary-lane, Whitecross-street, Ratcliff-highway,\r\nand in the street-markets generally, are to be seen men, women, and\r\nchildren selling _dinner knives and forks, razors, pocket-knives, and\r\nscissors_. The pocket-knives and scissors are kept well oiled, so that\r\nthe weather does not rust them. These goods have been mostly repaired,\r\nground, and polished for street-commerce. The women and children\r\nselling these articles are the wives and families of the men who\r\nrepair, grind, and polish them, and who belong, correctly speaking,\r\nto the class of street-artizans, under which head they will be more\r\nparticularly treated of. It is the same also with the street-vendors\r\nof second-hand tin saucepans and other vessels (a trade, by the way,\r\nwhich is rapidly decreasing), for these are generally made of the old\r\ndrums of machines retinned, or are old saucepans and pots mended for\r\nuse by the vendors, who are mostly working tinmen, and appertain to the\r\nartizan class.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND LINEN, &c.\r\n\r\nI now come to the second variety of the several kinds of street-sellers\r\nof second-hand articles. The accounts of the street-trade in\r\nsecond-hand linens, however, need be but brief; for none of the\r\ncallings I have now to notice supply a mode of subsistence to the\r\nstreet-sellers independently of other pursuits. They are resorted to\r\nwhenever an opportunity or a prospect of remuneration presents itself\r\nby the class of general street-sellers, women as well as men--the women\r\nbeing the most numerous. The sale of these articles is on the Saturday\r\nand Monday nights, in the street-markets, and daily in Petticoat and\r\nRosemary lanes.\r\n\r\nOne of the most saleable of all the second-hand textile commodities of\r\nthe streets, is an article the demand for which is certainly creditable\r\nto the poorer and the working-classes of London--_towels_. The\r\nprincipal supply of this street-towelling is obtained from the several\r\nbarracks in and near London. They are a portion of what were the\r\nsheets (of strong linen) of the soldiers’ beds, which are periodically\r\nrenewed, and the old sheeting is then sold to a contractor, of whom the\r\nstreet-folk buy it, and wash and prepare it for market. It is sold to\r\nthe street-traders at 4_d._ per pound, 1 lb. making eight penny towels;\r\nsome (inferior) is as low as 2_d._ The principal demand is by the\r\nworking-classes.\r\n\r\n“Why, for one time, sir,” said a street-seller to me, “there wasn’t\r\nmuch towelling in the streets, and I got a tidy lot, just when I\r\nknew it would go off, like a thief round a corner. I pitched in\r\nWhitecross-street, and not far from a woman that was making a great\r\nnoise, and had a good lot of people about her, for cheap mackarel\r\nweren’t so very plenty then as they are now. ‘Here’s your cheap\r\nmack’rel,’ shouts she, ‘cheap, cheap, cheap mac-mac-mac-_mack_’rel.\r\nThen _I_ begins: ‘Here’s your cheap towelling; cheap, cheap, cheap,\r\ntow-tow-tow-_tow_-ellings. Here’s towels a penny a piece, and two for\r\ntwopence, or a double family towel for twopence.’ I soon had a greater\r\ncrowd than she had. O, yes! I gives ’em a good history of what I has\r\nto sell; patters, as you call it; a man that can’t isn’t fit for the\r\nstreets. ‘Here’s what every wife should buy for her husband, and every\r\nhusband for his wife,’ I goes on. ‘Domestic happiness is then secured.\r\nIf a husband licks his wife, or a wife licks her husband, a towel is\r\nthe handiest and most innocent thing it can be done with, and if it’s\r\nwet it gives you a strong clipper on the cheek, as every respectable\r\nmarried person knows as well as I do. A clipper that way always does me\r\ngood, and I’m satisfied it does more good to a gentleman than a lady.’\r\nAlways patter for the women, sir, if you wants to sell. Yes, towels is\r\ngood sale in London, but I prefer country business. I’m three times\r\nas much in the country as in town, and I’m just off to Ascot to sell\r\ncards, and do a little singing, and then I’ll perhaps take a round to\r\nBath and Bristol, but Bath’s not what it was once.”\r\n\r\nAnother street-seller told me that, as far as his experience went,\r\nMonday night was a better time for the sale of second-hand sheetings,\r\n&c., than Saturday, as on Monday the wives of the working-classes who\r\nsought to buy cheaply what was needed for household use, usually went\r\nout to make their purchases. The Saturday-night’s mart is more one for\r\nimmediate necessities, either for the Sunday’s dinner or the Sunday’s\r\nwear. It appears to me that in all these little distinctions--of\r\nwhich street-folk tell you, quite unconscious that they tell anything\r\nnew--there is something of the history of the character of a people.\r\n\r\n“Wrappers,” or “bale-stuff,” as it is sometimes styled, are also sold\r\nin the streets as second-hand goods. These are what have formed the\r\ncovers of the packages of manufactures, and are bought (most frequently\r\nby the Jews) at the wholesale warehouses or the larger retail shops,\r\nand re-sold to the street-people, usually at 1-1/2_d._ and 2_d._ per\r\npound. These goods are sometimes sold entire, but are far more often\r\ncut into suitable sizes for towels, strong aprons, &c. They soon get\r\n“bleached,” I was told, by washing and wear.\r\n\r\n_“Burnt” linen or calico_ is also sold in the streets as a second-hand\r\narticle. On the occasion of a fire at any tradesman’s, whose stock of\r\ndrapery had been injured, the damaged wares are bought by the Jewish or\r\nother keepers of the haberdashery swag-shops. Some of these are sold\r\nby the second-hand street dealers, but the traffic for such articles\r\nis greater among the hawkers. Of this I have already given an account.\r\nThe street-sale of these burnt (and sometimes _designedly_ burnt) wares\r\nis in pieces, generally from 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ each, or in yards,\r\nfrequently at 6_d._ per yard, but of course the price varies with the\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nI believe that no _second-hand sheets_ are sold in the streets as\r\nsheets, for when tolerably good they are received at the pawn-shops,\r\nand if indifferent, at the dolly-shops, or illegal pawn-shops. Street\r\nfolk have told me of sheets being sold in the street-markets, but so\r\nrarely as merely to supply an exception. In Petticoat-lane, indeed,\r\nthey are sold, but it is mostly by the Jew shopkeepers, who also expose\r\ntheir goods in the streets, and they are sold by them very often to\r\nstreet-traders, who convert them into other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of this trade present great difficulties. The\r\nsecond-hand linen, &c., is not a regular street traffic. It may be\r\noffered to the public 20 days or nights in a month, or not one. If a\r\n“job-lot” have been secured, the second-hand street-seller may confine\r\nhimself to that especial stock. If his means compel him to offer only\r\na paucity of second-hand goods, he may sell but one kind. Generally,\r\nhowever, the same man or woman trades in two, three, or more of the\r\nsecond-hand textile productions which I have specified, and it is\r\nhardly one street-seller out of 20, who if he have cleared his 10_s._\r\nin a given time, by vending different articles, can tell the relative\r\namount he cleared on each. The trade is, therefore, irregular, and is\r\nbut a consequence, or--as one street-seller very well expressed it--a\r\n“tail” of other trades. For instance, if there has been a great auction\r\nof any corn-merchant’s effects, there will be more sacking than usual\r\nin the street-markets; if there have been sales, beyond the average\r\nextent, of old household furniture, there will be a more ample street\r\nstock of curtains, carpeting, fringes, &c. Of the articles I have\r\nenumerated the sale of second-hand linen, more especially that from the\r\nbarrack-stores, is the largest of any.\r\n\r\nThe most intelligent man whom I met with in this trade calculated that\r\nthere were 80 of these second-hand street-folk plying their trade two\r\nnights in the week; that they took 8_s._ each weekly, about half of it\r\nbeing profit; thus the street expenditure would be 1664_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND CURTAINS.\r\n\r\nSecond-Hand Curtains, but only good ones, I was assured, can now be\r\nsold in the streets, “because common new ones can be had so cheap.”\r\nThe “good second-hands,” however, sell readily. The most saleable of\r\nall second-hand curtains are those of chintz, especially old-fashioned\r\nchintz, now a scarce article; the next in demand are what were\r\ndescribed to me as “good check,” or the blue and white cotton curtains.\r\nWhite dimity curtains, though now rarely seen in a street-market,\r\nare not bought to be re-used as curtains--“there’s too much washing\r\nabout them for London”--but for petticoats, the covering of large\r\npincushions, dressing-table covers, &c., and for the last-mentioned\r\npurpose they are bought by the householders of a small tenement who let\r\na “well-furnished” bed-room or two.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which the second-hand chintz or check curtains are put,\r\nare often for “Waterloo” or “tent” beds. It is common for a single\r\nwoman, struggling to “get a decent roof over her head,” or for a\r\nyoung couple wishing to improve their comforts in furniture, to do so\r\npiece-meal. An old bedstead of a better sort may first be purchased,\r\nand so on to the concluding “decency,” or, in the estimation of some\r\npoor persons, “dignity” of curtains. These persons are customers of the\r\nstreet-sellers--the second-hand curtains costing them from 8_d._ to\r\n1_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nMoreen curtains have also a good sale. They are bought by working\r\npeople (and by some of the dealers in second-hand furniture) for the\r\nre-covering of sofas, which had become ragged, the deficiency of\r\nstuffing being supplied with hay (which is likewise the “stuffing” of\r\nthe new sofas sold by the “linen-drapers,” or “slaughter-houses”).\r\nMoreen curtains, too, are sometimes cut into pieces, for the\r\nre-covering of old horse-hair chairs, for which purpose they are sold\r\nat 3_d._ each piece.\r\n\r\nSecond-hand curtains are moreover cut into portions and sold for the\r\nhanging of the testers of bedsteads, but almost entirely for what\r\nthe street-sellers call “half-teesters.” These are required for the\r\nWaterloo bedsteads, “and if it’s a nice thing, sir,” said one woman,\r\n“and perticler if it’s a chintz, and to be had for 6_d._, the women’ll\r\nfight for it.”\r\n\r\nThe second-hand curtains, when sold entire, are from 6_d._ to 2_s._\r\n6_d._ One man had lately sold a pair of “good moreens, only faded, but\r\ndyeing’s cheap,” for 3_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND CARPETING, FLANNELS,\r\nSTOCKING-LEGS, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nI class these second-hand wares together, as they are all of woollen\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n_Carpeting_ has a fair sale, and in the streets is vended not as an\r\nentire floor or stair-carpet, but in pieces. The floor-carpet pieces\r\nare from 2_d._ to 1_s._ each; the stair-carpet pieces are from 1_d._ to\r\n4_d._ a yard. Hearth-rugs are very rarely offered to street-customers,\r\nbut when offered are sold from 4_d._ to 1_s._ Drugget is also sold in\r\nthe same way as the floor-carpeting, and sometimes for house-scouring\r\ncloths.\r\n\r\n“I’ve sold carpet, sir,” said a woman street-seller, who called all\r\ndescriptions--rugs and drugget too--by that title; “and I would like to\r\nsell it regular, but my old man--he buys everything--says it can’t be\r\nhad regular. I’ve sold many things in the streets, but I’d rather sell\r\ngood second-hand in carpet or curtains, or fur in winter, than anything\r\nelse. They’re nicer people as buys them. It would be a good business\r\nif it was regular. Ah! indeed, in my time, and before I was married,\r\nI have sold different things in a different way; but I’d rather not\r\ntalk about that, and I make no complaints, for seeing what I see.\r\nI’m not so badly off. Them as buys carpet are very particular--I’ve\r\nknown them take a tape out of their pockets and measure--but they’re\r\nhonourable customers. If they’re satisfied they buy, most of them does,\r\nat once; without any of your ‘is that the lowest?’ as ladies asks in\r\nshops, and that when they don’t think of buying, either. Carpet is\r\nbought by working people, and they use it for hearth-rugs, and for\r\nbed-sides, and such like. I know it by what I’ve heard them say when\r\nI’ve been selling. One Monday evening, five or six years back, I took\r\n10_s._ 9_d._ in carpet; there had been some great sales at old houses,\r\nand a good quantity of carpet and curtains was sold in the streets.\r\nPerhaps I cleared 3_s._ 6_d._ on that 10_s._ 9_d._ But to take 4_s._\r\nor 5_s._ is good work now, and often not more than 3_d._ in the 1_s._\r\nprofit. Still, it’s a pretty good business, when you can get a stock of\r\nsecond-hands of different kinds to keep you going constantly.”\r\n\r\nWhat in the street-trade is known as “_Flannels_,” is for the most part\r\nsecond-hand blankets, which having been worn as bed furniture, and then\r\nvery probably, or at the same time, used for ironing cloths, are found\r\nin the street-markets, where they are purchased for flannel petticoats\r\nfor the children of the poor, or when not good enough for such use, for\r\nhouse cloths, at 1_d._ each.\r\n\r\nThe trade in _stocking legs_ is considerable. In these legs the feet\r\nhave been cut off, further darning being impossible, and the fragment\r\nof the stocking which is worth preserving is sold to the careful\r\nhousewives who attach to it a new foot. Sometimes for winter wear a\r\nnew cheap sock is attached to the footless hose. These legs sell from\r\n1/2_d._ to 3_d._ the pair, but very rarely 3_d._, and only when of the\r\nbest quality, though the legs would not be saleable in the streets at\r\nall, had they not been of a good manufacture originally. Men’s hose are\r\nsold in this way more largely than women’s.\r\n\r\nThe trade in second-hand stockings is very considerable, but they form\r\na part of the second-hand apparel of street-commerce, and I shall\r\nnotice them under that head.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND BED-TICKING, SACKING, FRINGE, &c.\r\n\r\nFor _bed-ticking_ there is generally a ready sale, but I was told “not\r\nnear so ready as it was a dozen year or more back.” One reason which\r\nI heard assigned for this was, that new ticking was made so cheap\r\n(being a thin common cotton, for the lining of common carpet-bags,\r\nportmanteaus, &c.), that poor persons scrupled to give any equivalent\r\nprice for good sound second-hand linen bed-ticking, “though,” said a\r\ndealer, “it’ll still wear out half a dozen of their new slop rigs. I\r\nshould like a few of them there slop-masters, that’s making fortins out\r\nof foolish or greedy folks, to have to live a few weeks in the streets\r\nby this sort of second-hand trade; they’d hear what was thought of them\r\nthen by all sensible people, which aren’t so many as they should be by\r\na precious long sight.”\r\n\r\nThe ticking sold in the street is bought for the patching of beds and\r\nfor the making of pillows and bolsters, and for these purposes is\r\nsold in pieces at from 2_d._ to 4_d._ as the most frequent price. One\r\nwoman who used to sell bed-ticking, but not lately, told me that she\r\nknew poor women who cared nothing for such convenience themselves, buy\r\nticking to make pillows for their children.\r\n\r\n_Second-hand Sacking_ is sold without much difficulty in the\r\nstreet-markets, and usually in pieces at from 2_d._ to 6_d._ This\r\nsacking has been part of a corn sack, or of the strong package in which\r\nsome kinds of goods are dispatched by sea or railway. It is bought for\r\nthe mending of bedstead sacking, and for the making of porters’ knots,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n_Second-hand Fringe_ is still in fair demand, but though cheaper than\r\never, does not, I am assured, “sell so well as when it was dearer.”\r\nMany of my readers will have remarked, when they have been passing the\r\napartments occupied by the working class, that the valance fixed from\r\nthe top of the window has its adornment of fringe; a blind is sometimes\r\nadorned in a similar manner, and so is the valance from the tester of\r\na bedstead. For such uses the second-hand fringe is bought in the\r\nstreet-markets in pieces, sometimes called “quantities,” of from 1_d._\r\nto 1_s._\r\n\r\n_Second-hand Table-cloths_ used to be an article of street-traffic\r\nto some extent. If offered at all now--and one man, though he was a\r\nregular street-seller, thought he had not seen one offered in a market\r\nthis year--they are worn things such as will not be taken by the\r\npawnbrokers, while the dolly-shop people would advance no more than the\r\ntable-cloth might be worth for the rag-bag. _The glazed table-covers_,\r\nnow in such general use, are not as yet sold second-hand in the streets.\r\n\r\nI was told by a street-seller that he had heard an old man (since\r\ndead), who was a buyer of second-hand goods, say that in the old times,\r\nafter a great sale by auction--as at Wanstead-house (Mr. Wellesley\r\nPole’s), about 30 years ago--the open-air trade was very brisk, as the\r\nstreet-sellers, like the shop-traders, proclaimed all their second-hand\r\nwares as having been bought at “the great sale.” For some years no such\r\n“_ruse_” has been practised by street-folk.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND GLASS AND CROCKERY.\r\n\r\nThese sellers are another class who are fast disappearing from the\r\nstreets of London. Before glass and crockery, but more especially\r\nglass, became so low-priced when new, the second-hand glass-man was\r\none of the most prosperous of the open-air traders; he is now so much\r\nthe reverse that he must generally mix up some other calling with\r\nhis original business. One man, whose address was given to me as an\r\nexperienced glass-man, I found selling mackarel and “pound crabs,”\r\nand complaining bitterly that mackarel were high, and that he could\r\nmake nothing out of them that week at 2_d._ each, for poor persons, he\r\ntold me, would not give more. “Yes, sir,” he said, “I’ve been in most\r\ntrades, besides having been a pot-boy, both boy and man, and I don’t\r\nlike this fish-trade at all. I could get a pot-boy’s place again, but\r\nI’m not so strong as I were, and it’s slavish work in the place I could\r\nget; and a man that’s not so young as he was once is chaffed so by the\r\nyoung lads and fellows in the tap-room and the skittle-ground. For this\r\nlast three year or more I had to do something in addition to my glass\r\nfor a crust. Before I dropped it as a bad consarn, I sold old shoes as\r\nwell as old glass, and made both ends meet that way, a leather end and\r\na glass end. I sold off my glass to a rag and bottle shop for 9_s._,\r\nfar less than it were worth, and I swopped my shoes for my fish-stall,\r\nand water-tub, and 3_s._ in money. I’ll be out of this trade before\r\nlong. The glass was good once; I’ve made my 15_s._ and 20_s._ a week\r\nat it: I don’t know how long that is ago, but it’s a good long time.\r\nLatterly I could do no business at all in it, or hardly any. The old\r\nshoes was middling, because they’re a free-selling thing, but somehow\r\nit seems awkward mixing up any other trade with your glass.”\r\n\r\nThe stall or barrow of a “second-hand glass-man” presented, and still,\r\nin a smaller degree, presents, a variety of articles, and a variety\r\nof colours, but over the whole prevails that haziness which seems to\r\nbe considered proper to this trade. Even in the largest rag and bottle\r\nshops, the second-hand bottles always look dingy. “It wouldn’t pay to\r\nwash them all,” said one shopkeeper to me, “so we washes none; indeed,\r\nI b’lieve people would rather buy them as they is, and clean them\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nThe street-assortment of second-hand glass may be described as one of\r\n“odds and ends”--odd goblets, odd wine-glasses, odd decanters, odd\r\ncruet-bottles, salt-cellars, and mustard-pots; together with a variety\r\nof “tops” to fit mustard-pots or butter-glasses, and of “stoppers” to\r\nfit any sized bottle, the latter articles being generally the most\r\nprofitable. Occasionally may still be seen a blue spirit-decanter,\r\none of a set of three, with “brandy,” in faded gold letters, upon it,\r\nor a brass or plated label, as dingy as the bottle, hung by a fine\r\nwire-chain round the neck. Blue finger-glasses sold very well for use\r\nas sugar-basins to the wives of the better-off working-people or small\r\ntradesmen. One man, apparently about 40, who had been in this trade\r\nin his youth, and whom I questioned as to what was the quality of his\r\nstock, told me of the demand for “blue sugars,” and pointed out to me\r\none which happened to be on a stand by the door of a rag and bottle\r\nshop. When I mentioned its original use, he asked further about it,\r\nand after my answers seemed sceptical on the subject. “People that’s\r\nquality,” he said, “that’s my notion on it, that hasn’t neither to yarn\r\ntheir dinner, nor to cook it, but just open their mouths and eat it,\r\ncan’t dirty their hands so at dinner as to have glasses to wash ’em in\r\narterards. But there’s queer ways everywhere.”\r\n\r\nAt one time what were called “doctors’ bottles” formed a portion of\r\nthe second-hand stock I am describing. These were phials bought by\r\nthe poorer people, in which to obtain some physician’s gratuitous\r\nprescription from the chemist’s shop, or the time-honoured nostrum of\r\nsome wonderful old woman. For a very long period, it must be borne in\r\nmind, all kinds of glass wares were dear. Small glass frames, to cover\r\nflower-roots, were also sold at these stalls, as were fragments of\r\nlooking-glass. Beneath his stall or barrow, the “old glass-man” often\r\nhad a few old wine or beer-bottles for sale.\r\n\r\nAt the period before cast-glass was so common, and, indeed,\r\nsubsequently, until glass became cheap, it was not unusual to see at\r\nthe second-hand stalls, rich cut-glass vessels which had been broken\r\nand cemented, for sale at a low figure, the glass-man being often a\r\nmender. It was the same with China punch-bowls, and the costlier kind\r\nof dishes, but this part of the trade is now unknown.\r\n\r\nThere is one curious sort of ornament still to be met with at these\r\nstalls--wide-mouthed bottles, embellished with coloured patterns of\r\nflowers, birds, &c., generally cut from “furniture prints,” and kept\r\nclose against the sides of the interior by the salt with which the\r\nbottles are filled. A few second-hand pitchers, teapots, &c., are still\r\nsold at from 1_d._ to 6_d._\r\n\r\nThere are now not above six men (of the ordinary street-selling\r\nclass) who carry on this trade regularly. Sometimes twelve stalls or\r\nbarrows may be seen; sometimes one, and sometimes none. Calculating\r\nthat each of the six dealers takes 12_s._ weekly, with a profit of\r\n6_s._ or 7_s._, we find 187_l._ 4_s._ expended in this department of\r\nstreet-commerce. The principal place for the trade is in High-street,\r\nWhitechapel.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES.\r\n\r\nI have in a former page specified some of the goods which make up the\r\nsum of the second-hand miscellaneous commerce of the streets of London.\r\n\r\nI may premise that the trader of this class is a sort of street broker;\r\nand it is no more possible minutely to detail his especial traffic\r\nin the several articles of his stock, than it would be to give a\r\nspecific account of each and several of the “sundries” to be found in\r\nthe closets or corners of an old-furniture broker’s or marine-store\r\nseller’s premises, in describing his general business.\r\n\r\nThe members of this trade (as will be shown in the subsequent\r\nstatements) are also “miscellaneous” in their character. A few have\r\nknown liberal educations, and have been established in liberal\r\nprofessions; others have been artisans or shopkeepers, but the mass are\r\nof the general class of street-sellers.\r\n\r\nI will first treat of the _Second-Hand Street-Sellers of Articles for\r\nAmusement_, giving a wide interpretation to the word “amusement.”\r\n\r\nThe backgammon, chess, draught, and cribbage-boards of the second-hand\r\ntrade have originally been of good quality--some indeed of a very\r\nsuperior manufacture; otherwise the “cheap Germans” (as I heard\r\nthe low-priced foreign goods from the swag-shops called) would by\r\ntheir superior cheapness have rendered the business a nullity. The\r\nbackgammon-boards are bought of brokers, when they are often in a worn,\r\nunhinged, and what may be called ragged condition. The street-seller\r\n“trims them up,” but in this there is nothing of artisanship, although\r\nit requires some little taste and some dexterity of finger. A new hinge\r\nor two, or old hinges re-screwed, and a little pasting of leather and\r\nsometimes the application of strips of bookbinder’s gold, is all that\r\nis required. The backgammon-boards are sometimes offered in the streets\r\nby an itinerant; sometimes (and more frequently than otherwise in a\r\ndeplorable state, the points of the table being hardly distinguishable)\r\nthey are part of the furniture of a second-hand stall. I have seen one\r\nat an old book-stall, but most usually they are vended by being hawked\r\nto the better sort of public-houses, and there they are more frequently\r\ndisposed of by raffle than by sale. It is not once in a thousand times,\r\nI am informed, that second-hand “men” are sold with the board. Before\r\nthe board has gone through its series of hands to the street-seller,\r\nthe men have been lost or scattered. New men are sometimes sold or\r\nraffled with the backgammon-boards (as with the draught) at from 6_d._\r\nto 2_s._ 6_d._ the set, the best being of box-wood.\r\n\r\nChess-boards and men--for without the men of course a draught, or\r\nthe top of a backgammon-board suffices for chess--are a commodity now\r\nrarely at the disposal of the street-sellers; and, as these means\r\nof a leisurely and abstruse amusement are not of a ready sale, the\r\nsecond-hand dealers do not “look out” for them, but merely speculate\r\nin them when the article “falls in their way” and seems a palpable\r\nbargain. Occasionally, a second-hand chess apparatus is still sold\r\nby the street-folk. One man--upon whose veracity I have every reason\r\nto rely--told me that he once sold a beautiful set of ivory men and\r\na handsome “leather board” (second-hand) to a gentleman who accosted\r\nhim as he saw him carry them along the street for sale, inviting him\r\nto step in doors, when the gentleman’s residence was reached. The\r\nchess-men were then arranged and examined, and the seller asked 3_l._\r\n3_s._ for them, at once closing with the offer of 3_l._; “for I found,\r\nsir,” he said, “I had a gentleman to do with, for he told me he thought\r\nthey were really cheap at 3_l._, and he would give me that.” Another\r\ndealer in second-hand articles, when I asked him if he had ever sold\r\nchess-boards and men, replied, “Only twice, sir, and then at 4_s._ and\r\n5_s._ the set; they was poor. I’ve seen chess played, and I should say\r\nit’s a rum game; but I know nothing about it. I once had a old gent for\r\na customer, and he was as nice and quiet a old gent as could be, and\r\nI always called on him when I thought I had a curus old tea-caddy, or\r\nknife-box, or anything that way. He didn’t buy once in twenty calls,\r\nbut he always gave me something for my trouble. He used to play at\r\nchess with another old gent, and if, after his servant had told him I’d\r\ncome, I waited ’til I could wait no longer, and then knocked at his\r\nroom door, he swore like a trooper.”\r\n\r\nDraught-boards are sold at from 3_d._ to 1_s._ second-hand.\r\nCribbage-boards, also second-hand, and sometimes with cards, are only\r\nsold, I am informed, when they are very bad, at from 1_d._ to 3_d._,\r\nor very good, at from 2_s._ 6_d._ to 5_s._ One street-seller told me\r\nthat he once sold a “Chinee” cribbage-board for 18_s._, which cost\r\nhim 10_s._ “It was a most beautiful thing,” he stated, “and was very\r\nhigh-worked, and was inlaid with ivory, and with green ivory too.”\r\n\r\nThe Dice required for the playing of backgammon, or for any purpose,\r\nare bought of the waiters at the club-houses, generally at 2_l._ the\r\ndozen sets. They are retailed at about 25 per cent. profit. Dice in\r\nthis way are readily disposed of by the street-people, as they are\r\nlooked upon as “true,” and are only about a sixth of the price they\r\ncould be obtained for new ones in the duly-stamped covers. A few dice\r\nare sold at 6_d._ to 1_s._ the set, but they are old and battered.\r\n\r\nThere are but two men who support themselves wholly by the street-sale\r\nand the hawking of the different boards, &c., I have described. There\r\nare two, three, or sometimes four occasional participants in the\r\ntrade. Of these one held a commission in Her Majesty’s service, but\r\nwas ruined by gaming, and when unable to live by any other means, he\r\nsells the implements with which he had been but too familiar. “He lost\r\neverything in Jermyn-street,” a man who was sometimes his comrade in\r\nthe sale of these articles said to me, “but he is a very gentlemanly\r\nand respectable man.”\r\n\r\nThe profits in this trade are very uncertain. A man who was engaged\r\nin it told me that one week he had cleared 2_l._, and the next, with\r\ngreater pains-taking, did not sell a single thing.\r\n\r\nThe other articles which are a portion of the second-hand miscellaneous\r\ntrade of this nature are sold as often, or more often, at stalls than\r\nelsewhere. Dominoes, for instance, may be seen in the winter, and they\r\nare offered only in the winter, on perhaps 20 stalls. They are sold at\r\nfrom 4_d._ a set, and I heard of one superior set which were described\r\nto me as “brass-pinned,” being sold in a handsome box for 5_s._,\r\nthe shop price having been 15_s._ The great sale of dominoes is at\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\nPope-Joan boards, which, I was told, were fifteen years ago sold\r\nreadily in the streets, and were examined closely by the purchasers\r\n(who were mostly the wives of tradesmen), to see that the print\r\nor paint announcing the partitions for “intrigue,” “matrimony,”\r\n“friendship,” “Pope,” &c., were perfect, are now never, or rarely,\r\nseen. Formerly the price was 1_s._ to 1_s._ 9_d._ In the present year I\r\ncould hear of but one man who had even offered a Pope-board for sale in\r\nthe street, and he sold it, though almost new, for 3_d._\r\n\r\n“Fish,” or the bone, ivory, or mother-o’-pearl card counters in the\r\nshape of fish, or sometimes in a circular form, used to be sold\r\nsecond-hand as freely as the Pope-boards, and are now as rarely to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nUntil about 20 years ago, as well as I can fix upon a term from the\r\ninformation I received, the apparatus for a game known as the “Devil\r\namong the tailors” was a portion of the miscellaneous second-hand\r\ntrade or hawking of the streets. In it a top was set spinning on\r\na long board, and the result depended upon the number of men, or\r\n“tailors,” knocked down by the “devil” (top) of each player, these\r\ntailors being stationed, numbered, and scored (when knocked down) in\r\nthe same way as when the balls are propelled into the numbered sockets\r\nin a bagatelle-board. I am moreover told that in the same second-hand\r\ncalling were boards known as “solitaire-boards.” These were round\r\nboards, with a certain number of holes, in each of which was a peg. One\r\npeg was removed at the selection of the player, and the game consisted\r\nin taking each remaining peg, by advancing another over its head into\r\nany vacant hole, and if at the end of the game only one peg remained\r\nin the board, the player won; if winning it could be called when\r\nthe game could only be played by one person, and was for “solitary”\r\namusement. Chinese puzzles, sometimes on a large scale, were then also\r\na part of the second-hand traffic of the streets. These are a series\r\nof thin woods in geometrical shapes, which may be fitted into certain\r\nforms or patterns contained in a book, or on a sheet. These puzzles\r\nare sold in the streets still, but in smaller quantity and diminished\r\nsize. Different games played with the teetotum were also a part of\r\nsecond-hand street-sale, but none of these bygone pastimes were vended\r\nto any extent.\r\n\r\nFrom the best data I have been able to obtain it appears that the\r\namount received by the street-sellers or street-hawkers in the sale of\r\nthese second-hand articles of amusement is 10_l._ weekly, about half\r\nbeing profit, divided in the proportions I have intimated, as respects\r\nthe number of street-sellers and the periods of sale; or 520_l._\r\nexpended yearly.\r\n\r\nI should have stated that the principal customers of this branch\r\nof second-hand traders are found in the public-houses and at the\r\ncigar-shops, where the goods are carried by street-sellers, who hawk\r\nfrom place to place.\r\n\r\nThese dealers also attend the neighbouring, and, frequently in the\r\nsummer, the more distant races, where for dice and the better quality\r\nof their “boards,” &c., they generally find a prompt market. The sale\r\nat the fairs consists only of the lowest-priced goods, and in a very\r\nscant proportion compared to the races.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nOf this trade there are two branches; the sale of instruments which\r\nare really second-hand, and the sale of those which are pretendedly\r\nso; in other words, an honest and a dishonest business. As in street\r\nestimation the whole is a second-hand calling, I shall so deal with it.\r\n\r\nAt this season of the year, when fairs are frequent and the river\r\nsteamers with their bands of music run oft and regularly, and out-door\r\nmusic may be played until late, the calling of the street-musician\r\nis “at its best.” In the winter he is not unfrequently starving,\r\nespecially if he be what is called “a chance hand,” and have not\r\nthe privilege of playing in public-houses when the weather renders\r\nit impossible to collect a street audience. Such persons are often\r\ncompelled to part with their instruments, which they offer in the\r\nstreets or the public-houses, for the pawnbrokers have been so often\r\n“stuck” (taken in) with inferior instruments, that it is difficult to\r\npledge even a really good violin. With some of these musical men it\r\ngoes hard to part with their instruments, as they have their full share\r\nof the pride of art. Some, however, sell them recklessly and at almost\r\nany price, to obtain the means of prolonging a drunken carouse.\r\n\r\nFrom a man who is now a dealer in second-hand musical instruments, and\r\nis also a musician, I had the following account of his start in the\r\nsecond-hand trade, and of his feelings when he first had to part with\r\nhis fiddle.\r\n\r\n“I was a gentleman’s footboy,” he said, “when I was young, but I was\r\nalways very fond of music, and so was my father before me. He was a\r\ntailor in a village in Suffolk and used to play the bass-fiddle at\r\nchurch. I hardly know how or when I learned to play, but I seemed to\r\ngrow up to it. There was two neighbours used to call at my father’s\r\nand practise, and one or other was always showing me something, and so\r\nI learned to play very well. Everybody said so. Before I was twelve,\r\nI’ve played nearly all night at a dance in a farm-house. I never played\r\non anything but the violin. You must stick to one instrument, or you’re\r\nnot up to the mark on any if you keep changing. When I got a place as\r\nfootboy it was in a gentleman’s family in the country, and I never was\r\nso happy as when master and mistress was out dining, and I could play\r\nto the servants in the kitchen or the servants’ hall. Sometimes they\r\ngot up a bit of a dance to my violin. If there was a dance at Christmas\r\nat any of the tenants’, they often got leave for me to go and play. It\r\nwas very little money I got given, but too much drink. At last master\r\nsaid, he hired me to be his servant and not for a parish fiddler, so I\r\nmust drop it. I left him not long after--he got so cross and snappish.\r\nIn my next place--no, the next but one--I was on board wages, in\r\nLondon, a goodish bit, as the family were travelling, and I had time\r\non my hands, and used to go and play at public-houses of a night, just\r\nfor the amusement of the company at first, but I soon got to know other\r\nmusicians and made a little money. Yes, indeed, I could have saved\r\nmoney easily then, but I didn’t; I got too fond of a public-house life\r\nfor that, and was never easy at home.”\r\n\r\nI need not very closely pursue this man’s course to the streets, but\r\nmerely intimate it. He had several places, remaining in some a year or\r\nmore, in others two, three, or six months, but always unsettled. On\r\nleaving his last place he married a fellow-servant, older than himself,\r\nwho had saved “a goodish bit of money,” and they took a beer-shop in\r\nBermondsey. A “free and easy” (concert), both vocal and instrumental,\r\nwas held in the house, the man playing regularly, and the business\r\nwent on, not unprosperously, until the wife died in child-bed, the\r\nchild surviving. After this everything went wrong, and at last the man\r\nwas “sold up,” and was penniless. For three or four years he lived\r\nprecariously on what he could earn as a musician, until about six\r\nor seven years ago, when one bitter winter’s night he was without a\r\nfarthing, and had laboured all day in the vain endeavour to earn a\r\nmeal. His son, a boy then of five, had been sent home to him, and an\r\nold woman with whom he had placed the lad was incessantly dunning for\r\n12_s._ due for the child’s maintenance. The landlord clamoured for\r\n15_s._ arrear of rent for a furnished room, and the hapless musician\r\ndid not possess one thing which he could convert into money except his\r\nfiddle. He must leave his room next day. He had held no intercourse\r\nwith his friends in the country since he heard of his father’s death\r\nsome years before, and was, indeed, resourceless. After dwelling on\r\nthe many excellences of his violin, which he had purchased, “a dead\r\nbargain,” for 3_l._ 15_s._, he said: “Well, sir, I sat down by the\r\nlast bit of coal in the place, and sat a long time thinking, and\r\ndidn’t know what to do. There was nothing to hinder me going out in\r\nthe morning, and working the streets with a mate, as I’d done before,\r\nbut then there was little James that was sleeping there in his bed.\r\nHe was very delicate then, and to drag him about and let him sleep\r\nin lodging-houses would have killed him, I knew. But then I couldn’t\r\nthink of parting with my violin. I felt I should never again have such\r\nanother. I felt as if to part with it was parting with my last prop,\r\nfor what was I to do? I sat a long time thinking, with my instrument\r\non my knees, ’til--I’m sure I don’t know how to describe it--I felt\r\nas if I was drunk, though I hadn’t even tasted beer. So I went out\r\nboldly, just as if I _was_ drunk, and with a deal of trouble persuaded\r\na landlord I knew to lend me 1_l._ on my instrument, and keep it by him\r\nfor three months, ’til I could redeem it. I have it now, sir. Next day\r\nI satisfied my two creditors by paying each half, and a week’s rent in\r\nadvance, and I walked off to a shop in Soho, where I bought a dirty old\r\ninstrument, broken in parts, for 2_s._ 3_d._ I was great part of the\r\nday in doing it up, and in the evening earned 7_d._ by playing solos by\r\nWatchorn’s door, and the Crown and Cushion, and the Lord Rodney, which\r\nare all in the Westminster-road. I lodged in Stangate-street. There was\r\na young man--he looked like a respectable mechanic--gave me 1_d._, and\r\nsaid: ‘I wonder how you can use your fingers at all such a freezing\r\nnight. It seems a good fiddle.’ I assure you, sir, I was surprised\r\nmyself to find what I could do with my instrument. ‘There’s a beer-shop\r\nover the way,’ says the young man, ‘step in, and I’ll pay for a pint,\r\nand try my hand at it.’ And so it was done, and I sold him my fiddle\r\nfor 7_s._ 6_d._ No, sir, there was no take in; it was worth the money.\r\nI’d have sold it now that I’ve got a connection for half a guinea. Next\r\nday I bought such another instrument at the same shop for 3_s._, and\r\nsold it after a while for 6_s._, having done it up, in course. This\r\nit was that first put it into my head to start selling second-hand\r\ninstruments, and so I began. Now I’m known as a man to be depended on,\r\nand with my second-hand business, and engagements every now and then as\r\na musician, I do middling.”\r\n\r\nIn this manner is the honest second-hand street-business in musical\r\ninstruments carried on. It is usually done by hawking. A few, however,\r\nare sold at miscellaneous stalls, but they are generally such as\r\nrequire repair, and are often without the bow, &c. The persons carrying\r\non the trade have all, as far as I could ascertain, been musicians.\r\n\r\nOf the street-sale of musical instruments by drunken members of the\r\n“profession” I need say little, as it is exceptional, though it is\r\ncertainly a branch of the trade, for so numerous is the body of\r\nstreet-musicians, and of so many classes is it composed, that this\r\ndescription of second-hand business is being constantly transacted,\r\nand often to the profit of the more wary dealers in these goods. The\r\nstatistics I shall show at the close of my remarks on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MUSIC “DUFFERS.”\r\n\r\nSecond-Hand Guitars are vended by the street-sellers. The price\r\nvaries from 7_s._ 6_d._ to 15_s._ _Harps_ form no portion of the\r\nsecond-hand business of the streets. A _drum_ is occasionally, and\r\nonly occasionally, sold to a showman, but the chief second-hand traffic\r\nis in violins. _Accordions_, both new and old, used to sell readily in\r\nthe streets, either from stalls or in hawking, “but,” said a man who\r\nhad formerly sold them, “they have been regularly ‘duffed’ out of the\r\nstreets, so much cheap rubbish is made to sell. There’s next to nothing\r\ndone in them now. If one’s offered to a man that’s no judge of it,\r\nhe’ll be sure you want to cheat him, and perhaps abuse you; if he be a\r\njudge, of course it’s no go, unless with a really good article.”\r\n\r\nAmong the purchasers of second-hand musical instruments are those of\r\nthe working-classes who wish to “practise,” and the great number of\r\nstreet-musicians, street-showmen, and the indifferently paid members of\r\nthe orchestras of minor (and not always of minor) theatres. Few of this\r\nclass ever buy new instruments. There are sometimes, I am informed, as\r\nmany as 50 persons, one-fourth being women, engaged in this second-hand\r\nsale. Sometimes, as at present, there are not above half the number.\r\nA broker who was engaged in the traffic estimated--and an intelligent\r\nstreet-seller agreed in the computation--that, take the year through,\r\nat least 25 individuals were regularly, but few of them fully, occupied\r\nwith this traffic, and that their weekly takings averaged 30_s._ each,\r\nor an aggregate yearly amount of 190_l._ The weekly profits run from\r\n10_s._ to 15_s._, and sometimes the well-known dealers clear 40_s._\r\nor 50_s._ a week, while others do not take 5_s._ Of this amount about\r\ntwo-thirds is expended on violins, and one-tenth of the whole, or\r\nnearly a tenth, on “duffing” instruments sold as second-hand, in which\r\ndepartment of the business the amount “turned over” used to be twice,\r\nand even thrice as much. The sellers have nearly all been musicians in\r\nsome capacity, the women being the wives or connections of the men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat I have called the “dishonest trade” is known among the street-folk\r\nas “music-duffing.” Among the swag-shopkeepers, at one place in\r\nHoundsditch more especially, are dealers in “duffing fiddles.” These\r\nare German-made instruments, and are sold to the street-folk at 2_s._\r\n6_d._ or 3_s._ each, bow and all. When purchased by the music-duffers,\r\nthey are discoloured so as to be made to look old. A music-duffer,\r\nassuming the way of a man half-drunk, will enter a public-house or\r\naccost any party in the street, saying: “Here, I must have money, for I\r\nwon’t go home ’til morning, ’til morning, ’til morning, I won’t go home\r\n’til morning, ’til daylight does appear. And so I may as well sell my\r\nold fiddle myself as take it to a rogue of a broker. Try it anybody,\r\nit’s a fine old tone, equal to any Cremonar. It cost me two guineas\r\nand another fiddle, and a good ’un too, in exchange, but I may as well\r\nbe my own broker, for I must have money any how, and I’ll sell it for\r\n10_s._”\r\n\r\nPossibly a bargain is struck for 5_s._; for the duffing violin is\r\nperhaps purposely damaged in some slight way, so as to appear easily\r\nreparable, and any deficiency in tone may be attributed to that\r\ndefect, which was of course occasioned by the drunkenness of the\r\npossessor. Or possibly the tone of the instrument may not be bad, but\r\nit may be made of such unsound materials, and in such a slop-way,\r\nthough looking well to a little-practised eye, that it will soon fall\r\nto pieces. One man told me that he had often done the music-duffing,\r\nand had sold trash violins for 10_s._, 15_s._, and even 20_s._,\r\n“according,” he said, “to the thickness of the buyer’s head,” but that\r\nwas ten or twelve years ago.\r\n\r\nIt appears that when an impetus was given to the musical taste of the\r\ncountry by the establishment of cheap singing schools, or of music\r\nclasses, (called at one time “singing for the million”), or by the\r\nprevalence of cheap concerts, where good music was heard, this duffing\r\ntrade flourished, but now, I am assured, it is not more than a quarter\r\nof what it was. “There’ll always be something done in it,” said the\r\ninformant I have before quoted, “as long as you can find young men\r\nthat’s conceited about their musical talents, fond of taking their\r\nmedicine (drinking). If I’ve gone into a public-house room where I’ve\r\nseen a young gent that’s bought a duffing fiddle of me, it don’t happen\r\nonce in twenty times that he complains and blows up about it, and\r\nonly then, perhaps, if he happens to be drunkish, when people don’t\r\nmuch mind what’s said, and so it does me no harm. People’s too proud\r\nto confess that they’re ever ‘done’ at any time or in anything. Why,\r\nsuch gents has pretended, when I’ve sold ’em a duffer, and seen them\r\nafterwards, that they’ve done _me!_”\r\n\r\nNor is it to violins that this duffing or sham second-hand trade is\r\nconfined. At the swag-shops _duffing cornopeans_, _French horns_, and\r\n_clarionets_ are vended to the street-folk. One of these cornopeans\r\nmay be bought for 14_s._; a French horn for 10_s._; and a clarionet\r\nfor 7_s._ 6_d._; or as a general rule at one-fourth of the price of a\r\nproperly-made instrument sold as reasonably as possible. These things\r\nare also made to look old, and are disposed of in the same manner as\r\nthe duffing violins. The sale, however, is and was always limited,\r\nfor “if there be one working man,” I was told, “or a man of any sort\r\nnot professional in music, that tries his wind and his fingers on\r\na clarionet, there’s a dozen trying their touch and execution on a\r\nviolin.”\r\n\r\nAnother way in which the duffing music trade at one time was made\r\navailable as a second-hand business was this:--A band would play before\r\na pawnbroker’s door, and the duffing German brass instruments might be\r\nwell-toned enough, the inferiority consisting chiefly in the materials,\r\nbut which were so polished up as to appear of the best. Some member of\r\nthe band would then offer his brass instrument in pledge, and often\r\nobtain an advance of more than he had paid for it.\r\n\r\nOne man who had been himself engaged in what he called this “artful”\r\nbusiness, told me that when two pawnbrokers, whom he knew, found that\r\nthey had been tricked into advancing 15_s._ on cornopeans, which they\r\ncould buy new in Houndsditch for 14_s._, they got him to drop the\r\ntickets of the pledge, which they drew out for the purpose, in the\r\nstreets. These were picked up by some passer-by--and as there is a\r\nvery common feeling that there is no harm, or indeed rather a merit,\r\nin cheating a pawnbroker or a tax-gatherer--the instruments were soon\r\nredeemed by the fortunate finder, or the person to whom he had disposed\r\nof his prize. Nor did the roguery end here. The same man told me that\r\nhe had, in collusion with a pawnbroker, dropped tickets of (sham)\r\nsecond-hand musical instruments, which he had bought new at a swag-shop\r\nfor the very purpose, the amount on the duplicate being double the\r\ncost, and as it is known that the pawnbrokers do not advance the value\r\nof any article, the finders were gulled into redeeming the pledge, as\r\nan advantageous bargain. “But I’ve left off all that dodging now, sir,”\r\nsaid the man with a sort of a grunt, which seemed half a sigh and half\r\na laugh; “I’ve left it off entirely, for I found I was getting into\r\ntrouble.”\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the term “duffing” I am unable to discover. The Rev.\r\nMr. Dixon says, in his “Dovecote and Aviary,” that the term “_Duffer_,”\r\napplied to pigeons, is a corruption of _Dovehouse_,--but _query_? In\r\nthe slang dictionaries a “_Duffer_” is explained as “a man who hawks\r\nthings;” hence it would be equivalent to _Pedlar_, which means strictly\r\nbeggar--being from the Dutch _Bedclaar_, and the German _Bettler_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND WEAPONS.\r\n\r\nThe sale of second-hand pistols, for to that weapon the street-sellers’\r\nor hawkers’ trade in arms seems confined, is larger than might be\r\ncursorily imagined.\r\n\r\nThere must be something seductive about the possession of a pistol, for\r\nI am assured by persons familiar with the trade, that they have sold\r\nthem to men who were ignorant, when first invited to purchase, how the\r\nweapon was loaded or discharged, and seemed half afraid to handle it.\r\nPerhaps the possession imparts a sense of security.\r\n\r\nThe pistols which are sometimes seen on the street-stalls are almost\r\nalways old, rusted, or battered, and are useless to any one except to\r\nthose who can repair and clean them for sale.\r\n\r\nThere are three men now selling new or second-hand pistols, I am told,\r\nwho have been gunmakers.\r\n\r\nThis trade is carried on almost entirely by hawking to public-houses.\r\nI heard of no one who depended solely upon it, “but this is the way,”\r\none intelligent man stated to me, “if I am buying second-hand things\r\nat a broker’s, or in Petticoat-lane, or anywhere, and there’s a pistol\r\nthat seems cheap, I’ll buy it as readily as anything I know, and I’ll\r\nsoon sell it at a public-house, or I’ll get it raffled for. Second-hand\r\npistols sell better than new by such as me. If I was to offer a new\r\none I should be told it was some Brummagem slop rubbish. If there’s\r\na little silver-plate let into the wood of the pistol, and a crest\r\nor initials engraved on it--I’ve got it done sometimes--there’s a\r\nbetter chance of sale, for people think it’s been made for somebody\r\nof consequence that wouldn’t be fobbed off with an inferior thing. I\r\ndon’t think I’ve often sold pistols to working-men, but I’ve known them\r\njoin in raffles for them, and the winner has often wanted to sell it\r\nback to me, and has sold it to somebody. It’s tradesmen that buy, or\r\ngentlefolks, if you can get at them. A pistol’s a sort of a plaything\r\nwith them.”\r\n\r\nOn my talking with a street-dealer concerning the street-trade in\r\nsecond-hand pistols, he produced a handsome pistol from his pocket.\r\nI inquired if it was customary for men in his way of life to carry\r\npistols, and he expressed his conviction that it was, but only when\r\ntravelling in the country, and in possession of money or valuable\r\nstock. “I gave only 7_s._ 6_d._ for this pistol,” he said, “and have\r\nrefused 10_s._ 6_d._ for it, for I shall get a better price, as it’s an\r\nexcellent article, on some of my rounds in town. I bought it to take to\r\nAscot races with me, and have it with me now, but it’s not loaded, for\r\nI’m going to Moulsey Hurst, where Hampton races are held. You’re not\r\nsafe if you travel after a great muster at a race by yourself without a\r\npistol. Many a poor fellow like me has been robbed, and the public hear\r\nnothing about it, or say it’s all gammon. At Ascot, sir, I trusted my\r\nmoney to a booth-keeper I knew, as a few men slept in his booth, and he\r\nput my bit of tin with his own under his head where he slept, for safe\r\nkeeping. There’s a little doing in second-hand pistols to such as me,\r\nbut we generally sell them again.”\r\n\r\nOf _second-hand guns_, or other offensive weapons, there is no street\r\nsale. A few “_life-preservers_,” some of gutta percha, are hawked,\r\nbut they are generally new. Bullets and powder are not sold by the\r\npistol-hawkers, but a _mould_ for the casting of bullets is frequently\r\nsold along with the weapon.\r\n\r\nOf these second-hand pistol-sellers there are now, I am told, more than\r\nthere were last year. “I really believe,” said one man, laughing, but I\r\nheard a similar account from others, “people were afraid the foreigners\r\ncoming to the Great Exhibition had some mischief in their noddles, and\r\nso a pistol was wanted for protection. In my opinion, a pistol’s just\r\none of the things that people don’t think of buying, ’til it’s shown to\r\nthem, and then they’re tempted to have it.”\r\n\r\nThe principal street-sale, independently of the hawking to\r\npublic-houses, is in such places as Ratcliffe-highway, where the mates\r\nand petty officers of ships are accosted and invited to buy a good\r\nsecond-hand pistol. The wares thus vended are generally of a well-made\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nIn this traffic, which is known as a “straggling” trade, pursued by\r\nmen who are at the same time pursuing other street-callings, it may be\r\nestimated, I am assured, that there are 20 men engaged, each taking\r\nas an average 1_l._ a week. In some weeks a man may take 5_l._; in\r\nthe next month he may sell no weapons at all. From 30 to 50 per cent.\r\nis the usual rate of profit, and the yearly street outlay on these\r\nsecond-hand offensive or defensive weapons is 1040_l._\r\n\r\nOne man who “did a little in pistols” told me, “that 25 or 30 years\r\nago, when he was a boy, his father sometimes cleared 2_l._ a week in\r\nthe street-sale and hawking of second-hand _boxing-gloves_, and that\r\nhe himself had sometimes carried the ‘gloves’ in his hand, and pistols\r\nin his pocket for sale, but that now boxing-gloves were in no demand\r\nwhatever among street-buyers, and were ‘a complete drug.’ He used to\r\nsell them at 3_s._ the set, which is four gloves.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND CURIOSITIES.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the things known in the street-trade as “curiosities” can\r\nhardly be styled second-hand with any propriety, but they are so styled\r\nin the streets, and are usually vended by street-merchants who trade in\r\nsecond-hand wares.\r\n\r\nCuriosities are displayed, I cannot say temptingly (except perhaps to a\r\nsanguine antiquarian), for there is a great dinginess in the display,\r\non stalls. One man whom I met wheeling his barrow in High-street,\r\nCamden-town, gave me an account of his trade. He was dirtily rather\r\nthan meanly clad, and had a very self-satisfied expression of face.\r\nThe principal things on his barrow were _coins_, _shells_, and _old\r\nbuckles_, with a pair of the very high and wooden-heeled _shoes_, worn\r\nin the earlier part of the last century.\r\n\r\nThe coins were all of copper, and certainly did not lack variety.\r\nAmong them were tokens, but none very old. There was the head of\r\n“Charles Marquis Cornwallis” looking fierce in a cocked hat, while\r\non the reverse was Fame with her trumpet and a wreath, and banners\r\nat her feet, with the superscription: “His fame resounds from east\r\nto west.” There was a head of Wellington with the date 1811, and the\r\nlegend of “Vincit amor patriæ.” Also “The R. Hon. W. Pitt, Lord Warden\r\nCinque Ports,” looking courtly in a bag wig, with his hair brushed\r\nfrom his brow into what the curiosity-seller called a “topping.” This\r\nwas announced as a “Cinque Ports token payable at Dover,” and was\r\ndated 1794. “Wellingtons,” said the man, “is cheap; that one’s only a\r\nhalfpenny, but here’s one here, sir, as you seem to understand coins,\r\nas I hope to get 2_d._ for, and will take no less. It’s ‘J. Lackington,\r\n1794,’ you see, and on the back there’s a Fame, and round her is\r\nwritten--and it’s a good speciment of a coin--‘Halfpenny of Lackington,\r\nAllen & Co., cheapest booksellers in the world.’ That’s scarcer and\r\nmore vallyballer than Wellingtons or Nelsons either.” Of the current\r\ncoin of the realm, I saw none older than Charles II., and but one of\r\nhis reign, and little legible. Indeed the reverse had been ground quite\r\nsmooth, and some one had engraved upon it “Charles Dryland Tunbridg.”\r\nA small “e” over the “g” of Tunbridg perfected the orthography. This,\r\nthe street-seller said, was a “love-token” as well as an old coin, and\r\n“them love-tokens was getting scarce.” Of foreign and colonial coins\r\nthere were perhaps 60. The oldest I saw was one of Louis XV. of France\r\nand Navarre, 1774. There was one also of the “Republique Francaise”\r\nwhen Napoleon was First Consul. The colonial coins were more numerous\r\nthan the foreign. There was the “One Penny token” of Lower Canada;\r\nthe “one quarter anna” of the East India Company; the “half stiver\r\nof the colonies of Essequibo and Demarara;” the “halfpenny token of\r\nthe province of Nova Scotia,” &c. &c. There were also counterfeit\r\nhalfcrowns and bank tokens worn from their simulated silver to rank\r\ncopper. The principle on which this man “priced” his coins, as he\r\ncalled it, was simple enough. What was the size of a halfpenny he asked\r\na penny for; the size of a penny coin was 2_d._ “It’s a difficult trade\r\nis mine, sir,” he said, “to carry on properly, for you may be so easily\r\ntaken in, if you’re not a judge of coins and other curiosities.”\r\n\r\nThe shells of this man’s stock in trade he called “conks” and “king\r\nconks.” He had no “clamps” then, he told me, but they sold pretty well;\r\nhe described them as “two shells together, one fitting inside the\r\nother.” He also had sold what he called “African cowries,” which were\r\nas “big as a pint pot,” and the smaller cowries, which were “money in\r\nIndia, for his father was a soldier and had been there and saw it.” The\r\nshells are sold from 1_d._ to 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nThe old buckles were such as used to be worn on shoes, but the plate\r\nwas all worn off, and “such like curiosities,” the man told me, “got\r\nscarcer and scarcer.”\r\n\r\nMany of the stalls which are seen in the streets are the property of\r\nadjacent shop or store-keepers, and there are not now, I am informed,\r\nmore than six men who carry on this trade apart from other commerce.\r\nTheir average takings are 15_s._ weekly each man, about two-thirds\r\nbeing profit, or 234_l._ in a year. Some of the stands are in Great\r\nWyld-street, but they are chiefly the property of the second-hand\r\nfurniture brokers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND TELESCOPES AND POCKET GLASSES.\r\n\r\nIn the sale of second-hand telescopes only one man is now engaged\r\nin any extensive way, except on mere chance occasions. Fourteen or\r\nfifteen years ago, I was informed, there was a considerable street sale\r\nin small telescopes at 1_s._ each. They were made at Birmingham, my\r\ninformant believed, but were sold as second-hand goods in London. Of\r\nthis trade there is now no remains.\r\n\r\nThe principal seller of second-hand telescopes takes a stand on Tower\r\nHill or by the Coal Exchange, and his customers, as he sells excellent\r\n“glasses,” are mostly sea-faring men. He has sold, and still sells,\r\ntelescopes from 2_l._ 10_s._ to 5_l._ each, the purchasers generally\r\n“trying” them, with strict examination, from Tower Hill, or on the\r\nCustom-House Quay. There are, in addition to this street-seller, six\r\nand sometimes eight others, who offer telescopes to persons about the\r\ndocks or wharfs, who may be going some voyage. These are as often new\r\nas second-hand, but the second-hand articles are preferred. This,\r\nhowever, is a Jewish trade which will be treated of under another head.\r\n\r\nAn old opera-glass, or the smaller articles best known as\r\n“pocket-glasses,” are occasionally hawked to public-houses and offered\r\nin the streets, but so little is done in them that I can obtain no\r\nstatistics. A spectacle seller told me that he had once tried to sell\r\ntwo second-hand opera-glasses at 2_s._ 6_d._ each, in the street, and\r\nthen in the public-houses, but was laughed at by the people who were\r\nusually his customers. “Opera-glasses!” they said, “why, what did they\r\nwant with opera-glasses? wait until they had opera-boxes.” He sold the\r\nglasses at last to a shopkeeper.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SECOND-HAND ARTICLES.\r\n\r\nThe other second-hand articles sold in the streets I will give under\r\none head, specifying the different characteristics of the trade, when\r\nany striking peculiarities exist. To give a detail of the whole trade,\r\nor rather of the several kinds of articles in the whole trade, is\r\nimpossible. I shall therefore select only such as are sold the more\r\nextensively, or present any novel or curious features of second-hand\r\nstreet-commerce.\r\n\r\n_Writing-desks_, _tea-caddies_, _dressing-cases_, and _knife-boxes_\r\nused to be a ready sale, I was informed, when “good second-hand;” but\r\nthey are “got up” now so cheaply by the poor fancy cabinet-makers\r\nwho work for the “slaughterers,” or furniture warehouses, and for\r\nsome of the general-dealing swag-shops, that the sale of anything\r\nsecond-hand is greatly diminished. In fact I was told that as regards\r\nsecond-hand writing-desks and dressing-cases, it might be said there\r\nwas “no trade at all now.” A few, however, are still to be seen at\r\nmiscellaneous stalls, and are occasionally, but very rarely, offered\r\nat a public-house “used” by artisans who may be considered “judges” of\r\nwork. The tea-caddies are the things which are in best demand. “Working\r\npeople buy them,” I was informed, and “working people’s wives. When\r\nwomen are the customers they look closely at the lock and key, as they\r\nkeep ‘my uncle’s cards’ there” (pawnbroker’s duplicates).\r\n\r\nOne man had lately sold second-hand tea-caddies at 9_d._, 1_s._, and\r\n1_s._ 3_d._ each, and cleared 2_s._ in a day when he had stock and\r\ndevoted his time to this sale. He could not persevere in it if he\r\nwished, he told me, as he might lose a day in looking out for the\r\ncaddies; he might go to fifty brokers and not find one caddy cheap\r\nenough for his purpose.\r\n\r\n_Brushes_ are sold second-hand in considerable quantities in the\r\nstreets, and are usually vended at stalls. Shoe-brushes are in the\r\nbest demand, and are generally sold, when in good condition, at 1_s._\r\nthe set, the cost to the street-seller being 8_d._ They are bought, I\r\nwas told, by the people who clean their own shoes, or have to clean\r\nother people’s. Clothes’ brushes are not sold to any extent, as the\r\n“hard brush” of the shoe set is used by working people for a clothes’\r\nbrush. Of late, I am told, second-hand brushes have sold more freely\r\nthan ever. They were hardly to be had just when wanted, in a sufficient\r\nquantity, for the demand by persons going to Epsom and Ascot races, who\r\ncarry a brush of little value with them, to brush the dust gathered\r\non the road from their coats. The coster-girls buy very hard brushes,\r\nindeed mere stumps, with which they brush radishes; these brushes are\r\nvended at the street-stalls at 1_d._ each.\r\n\r\nIn _Stuffed Birds_ for the embellishment of the walls of a room, there\r\nis still a small second-hand street sale, but none now in images or\r\nchimney-piece ornaments. “Why,” said one dealer, “I can now buy new\r\nfigures for 9_d._, such as not many years ago cost 7_s._, so what\r\nchance of a second-hand sale is there?” The stuffed birds which sell\r\nthe best are starlings. They are all sold as second-hand, but are often\r\n“made up” for street-traffic; an old bird or two, I was told, in a new\r\ncase, or a new bird in an old case. Last Saturday evening one man told\r\nme he had sold two “long cases” of starlings and small birds for 2_s._\r\n6_d._ each. There are no stuffed parrots or foreign birds in this sale,\r\nand no pheasants or other game, except sometimes wretched old things\r\nwhich are sold because they happen to be in a case.\r\n\r\nThe street-trade in second-hand _Lasts_ is confined principally\r\nto Petticoat and Rosemary lanes, where they are bought by the\r\n“garret-masters” in the shoemaking trade who supply the large wholesale\r\nwarehouses; that is to say, by small masters who find their own\r\nmaterials and sell the boots and shoes by the dozen pairs. The lasts\r\nare bought also by mechanics, street-sellers, and other poor persons\r\nwho cobble their own shoes. A shoemaker told me that he occasionally\r\nbought a last at a street stall, or rather from street hampers in\r\nPetticoat and Rosemary lanes, and it seemed to him that second-hand\r\nstores of street lasts got neither bigger nor smaller: “I suppose\r\nit’s this way,” he reasoned; “the garret-master buys lasts to do the\r\nslop-snobbing cheap, mostly women’s lasts, and he dies or is done up\r\nand goes to the “great house,” and his lasts find their way back to\r\nthe streets. You notice, sir, the first time you’re in Rosemary-lane,\r\nhow little a great many of the lasts have been used, and that shows\r\nwhat a terrible necessity there was to part with them. In some there’s\r\nhardly any peg-marks at all.” The lasts are sold from 1_d._ to 3_d._\r\neach, or twice that amount in pairs, “rights and lefts,” according to\r\nthe size and the condition. There are about 20 street last-sellers in\r\nthe second-hand trade of London--“at least 20,” one man said, after he\r\nseemed to have been making a mental calculation on the subject.\r\n\r\n_Second-hand harness_ is sold largely, and when good is sold very\r\nreadily. There is, I am told, far less slop-work in harness-making than\r\nin shoemaking or in the other trades, such as tailoring, and “many\r\na lady’s pony harness,” it was said to me by a second-hand dealer,\r\n“goes next to a tradesman, and next to a costermonger’s donkey, and if\r\nit’s been good leather to begin with--as it will if it was made for a\r\nlady--why the traces’ll stand clouting, and patching, and piecing, and\r\nmending for a long time, and they’ll do to cobble old boots last of\r\nall, for old leather’ll wear just in treading, when it might snap at a\r\npull. Give me a good quality to begin with, sir, and it’s serviceable\r\nto the end.” In my inquiries among the costermongers I ascertained\r\nthat if one of that body started his donkey, or rose from that to his\r\npony, he never bought new harness, unless it were a new collar if he\r\nhad a regard for the comfort of his beast, but bought old harness, and\r\n“did it up” himself, often using iron rivets, or clenched nails, to\r\nreunite the broken parts, where, of course, a harness-maker would apply\r\na patch. Nor is it the costermongers alone who buy all their harness\r\nsecond-hand. The sweep, whose stock of soot is large enough to require\r\nthe help of an ass and a cart in its transport; the collector of bones\r\nand offal from the butchers’ slaughter-houses or shops; and the many\r\nwho may be considered as co-traders with the costermonger class--the\r\ngreengrocer, the street coal-seller by retail, the salt-sellers, the\r\ngravel and sand dealer (a few have small carts)--all, indeed, of\r\nthat class of traders, buy their harness second-hand, and generally\r\nin the streets. The chief sale of second-hand harness is on the\r\nFriday afternoons, in Smithfield. The more especial street-sale is in\r\nPetticoat and Rosemary lanes, and in the many off-streets and alleys\r\nwhich may be called the tributaries to those great second-hand marts.\r\nThere is no sale of these wares in the Saturday night markets, for\r\nin the crush and bustle generally prevailing there at such times,\r\nno room could be found for things requiring so much space as sets\r\nof second-hand harness, and no time sufficiently to examine them.\r\n“There’s so much to look at, you understand, sir,” said one second-hand\r\nstreet-trader, who did a little in harness as well as in barrows, “if\r\nyou wants a decent set, and don’t grudge a shilling or two--and I never\r\ngrudges them myself when I has ’em--so that it takes a little time. You\r\nmust see that the buckles has good tongues--and it’s a sort of joke in\r\nthe trade that a bad tongue’s a d----d bad thing--and that the pannel\r\nof the pad ain’t as hard as a board (flocks is the best stuffing, sir),\r\nand that the bit, if it’s rusty, can be polished up, for a animal no\r\nmore likes a rusty bit in his mouth than we likes a musty bit of bread\r\nin our’n. O, a man as treats his ass as a ass ought to be treated--and\r\nit’s just the same if he has a pony--can’t be too perticler. If I\r\nhad my way I’d ’act a law making people perticler about ’osses’ and\r\nasses’ shoes. If your boot pinches you, sir, you can sing out to your\r\nbootmaker, but a ass can’t blow up a farrier.” It seems to me that in\r\nthese homely remarks of my informant, there is, so to speak, a sound\r\npractical kindliness. There can be little doubt that a fellow who\r\nmaltreats his ass or his dog, maltreats his wife and children when he\r\ndares.\r\n\r\n_Clocks_ are sold second-hand, but only by three or four foreigners,\r\nDutchmen or Germans, who hawk them and sell them at 2_s._ 6_d._ or\r\n3_s._ each, Dutch clocks only being disposed of in this way. These\r\ntraders, therefore, come under the head of STREET-FOREIGNERS. “Ay,” one\r\nstreet-seller remarked to me, “it’s only Dutch now as is second-handed\r\nin the streets, but it’ll soon be Americans. The swags is some of them\r\nhung up with Slick’s;” [so he called the American clocks, meaning the\r\n“Sam _Slicks_,” in reference to Mr. Justice Hallyburton’s work of that\r\ntitle;] “they’re hung up with ’em, sir, and no relation whatsomever\r\n(pawnbroker) ’ll give a printed character of ’em (a duplicate), and\r\nso they must come to the streets, and jolly cheap they’ll be.” The\r\nforeigners who sell the second-hand Dutch clocks sell also new clocks\r\nof the same manufacture, and often on tally, 1_s._ a week being the\r\nusual payment.\r\n\r\n_Cartouche-boxes_ are sold at the miscellaneous stalls, but only after\r\nthere has been what I heard called a “Tower sale” (sale of military\r\nstores). When bought of the street-sellers, the use of these boxes is\r\nfar more peaceful than that for which they were manufactured. Instead\r\nof the receptacles of cartridges, the divisions are converted into nail\r\nboxes, each with its different assortment, or contain the smaller kinds\r\nof tools, such as awl-blades. These boxes are sold in the streets at\r\n1/2_d._ or 1_d._ each, and are bought by jobbing shoemakers more than\r\nby any other class.\r\n\r\nOf the other second-hand commodities of the streets, I may observe\r\nthat in _Trinkets_ the trade is altogether Jewish; in _Maps_, with\r\nframes, it is now a nonentity, and so it is with _Fishing-rods_,\r\n_Cricket-bats_, _&c._\r\n\r\nIn _Umbrellas_ and _Parasols_ the second-hand traffic is large, but\r\nthose vended in the streets are nearly all “done up” for street-sale by\r\nthe class known as “Mush,” or more properly “Mushroom Fakers,” that is\r\nto say, the makers or _fakers_ (_facere_--the slang _fakement_ being\r\nsimply a corruption of the Latin _facimentum_) of those articles which\r\nare similar in shape to _mushrooms_. I shall treat of this class and\r\nthe goods they sell under the head of Street-Artisans. The collectors\r\nof Old Umbrellas and Parasols are the same persons as collect the\r\nsecond-hand habiliments of male and female attire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe men and women engaged in the street-commerce carried on in\r\nsecond-hand articles are, in all respects, a more mixed class than the\r\ngenerality of street-sellers. Some hawk in the streets goods which they\r\nalso display in their shops, or in the windowless apartments known\r\nas their shops. Some are not in possession of shops, but often buy\r\ntheir wares of those who are. Some collect or purchase the articles\r\nthey vend; others collect them by barter. The itinerant crock-man, the\r\nroot-seller, the glazed table-cover seller, the hawker of spars and\r\nworked stone, and even the costermonger of the morning, is the dealer\r\nin second-hand articles of the afternoon and evening. The costermonger\r\nis, moreover, often the buyer and seller of second-hand harness in\r\nSmithfield. I may point out again, also, what a multifariousness of\r\nwares passes in the course of a month through the hands of a general\r\nstreet-seller; at one time new goods, at another second-hand; sometimes\r\nhe is stationary at a pitch vending “lots,” or “swag toys;” at others\r\nitinerant, selling braces, belts, and hose.\r\n\r\nI found no miscellaneous dealer who could tell me of the proportionate\r\nreceipts from the various articles he dealt in even for the last\r\nmonth. He “did well” in this, and badly in the other trade, but beyond\r\nsuch vague statements there is no precise information to be had. It\r\nshould be recollected that the street-sellers do not keep accounts, or\r\nthose documents would supply references. “It’s all headwork with us,” a\r\nstreet-seller said, somewhat boastingly, to me, as if the ignorance of\r\nbook-keeping was rather commendable.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF SECOND-HAND STORE SHOPS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may add to the completeness of the information here given\r\nconcerning the trading in old refuse articles, and especially those\r\nof a miscellaneous character, the manner in which, and the parties\r\nby whom the business is carried on, if I conclude this branch of the\r\nsubject by an account of the shops of the second-hand dealers. The\r\ndistance between the class of these shopkeepers and of the stall and\r\nbarrow-keepers I have described is not great. It may be said to be\r\nmerely from the street to within doors. Marine-store dealers have\r\noften in their start in life been street-sellers, not unfrequently\r\ncostermongers, and street-sellers they again become if their ventures\r\nbe unsuccessful. Some of them, however, make a good deal of money in\r\nwhat may be best understood as a “hugger-mugger way.”\r\n\r\nOn this subject I cannot do better than quote Mr. Dickens, one of the\r\nmost minute and truthful of observers:--\r\n\r\n“The reader must often have perceived in some by-street, in a poor\r\nneighbourhood, a small dirty shop, exposing for sale the most\r\nextraordinary and confused jumble of old, worn-out, wretched articles,\r\nthat can well be imagined. Our wonder at their ever having been bought,\r\nis only to be equalled by our astonishment at the idea of their ever\r\nbeing sold again. On a board, at the side of the door, are placed about\r\ntwenty books--all odd volumes; and as many wine-glasses--all different\r\npatterns; several locks, an old earthenware pan, full of rusty keys;\r\ntwo or three gaudy chimney ornaments--cracked, of course; the remains\r\nof a lustre, without any drops; a round frame like a capital O, which\r\nhas once held a mirror; a flute, complete with the exception of the\r\nmiddle joint; a pair of curling-irons; and a tinder-box. In front of\r\nthe shop-window, are ranged some half-dozen high-backed chairs, with\r\nspinal complaints and wasted legs; a corner cupboard; two or three\r\nvery dark mahogany tables with flaps like mathematical problems; some\r\npickle-bottles, some surgeons’ ditto, with gilt labels and without\r\nstoppers; an unframed portrait of some lady who flourished about the\r\nbeginning of the thirteenth century, by an artist who never flourished\r\nat all; an incalculable host of miscellanies of every description,\r\nincluding armour and cabinets, rags and bones, fenders and street-door\r\nknockers, fire-irons, wearing-apparel and bedding, a hall-lamp, and\r\na room-door. Imagine, in addition to this incongruous mass, a black\r\ndoll in a white frock, with two faces--one looking up the street, and\r\nthe other looking down, swinging over the door; a board with the\r\nsqueezed-up inscription ‘Dealer in marine stores,’ in lanky white\r\nletters, whose height is strangely out of proportion to their width;\r\nand you have before you precisely the kind of shop to which we wish to\r\ndirect your attention.\r\n\r\n“Although the same heterogeneous mixture of things will be found at\r\nall these places, it is curious to observe how truly and accurately\r\nsome of the minor articles which are exposed for sale--articles of\r\nwearing-apparel, for instance--mark the character of the neighbourhood.\r\nTake Drury-lane and Covent-garden for example.\r\n\r\n“This is essentially a theatrical neighbourhood. There is not a potboy\r\nin the vicinity who is not, to a greater or less extent, a dramatic\r\ncharacter. The errand-boys and chandlers’-shop-keepers’ sons, are\r\nall stage-struck: they ‘get up’ plays in back kitchens hired for the\r\npurpose, and will stand before a shop-window for hours, contemplating\r\na great staring portrait of Mr. somebody or other, of the Royal Coburg\r\nTheatre, ‘as he appeared in the character of Tongo the Denounced.’\r\nThe consequence is, that there is not a marine-store shop in the\r\nneighbourhood, which does not exhibit for sale some faded articles of\r\ndramatic finery, such as three or four pairs of soiled buff boots with\r\nturn-over red tops, heretofore worn by a ‘fourth robber,’ or ‘fifth\r\nmob;’ a pair of rusty broad-swords, a few gauntlets, and certain\r\nresplendent ornaments, which, if they were yellow instead of white,\r\nmight be taken for insurance plates of the Sun Fire-office. There are\r\nseveral of these shops in the narrow streets and dirty courts, of\r\nwhich there are so many near the national theatres, and they all have\r\ntempting goods of this description, with the addition, perhaps, of a\r\nlady’s pink dress covered with spangles; white wreaths, stage shoes,\r\nand a tiara like a tin lamp reflector. They have been purchased of some\r\nwretched supernumeraries, or sixth-rate actors, and are now offered\r\nfor the benefit of the rising generation, who, on condition of making\r\ncertain weekly payments, amounting in the whole to about ten times\r\ntheir value, may avail themselves of such desirable bargains.\r\n\r\n“Let us take a very different quarter, and apply it to the same\r\ntest. Look at a marine-store dealer’s, in that reservoir of dirt,\r\ndrunkenness, and drabs: thieves, oysters, baked potatoes, and pickled\r\nsalmon--Ratcliff-highway. Here, the wearing-apparel is all nautical.\r\nRough blue jackets, with mother-of-pearl buttons, oil-skin hats,\r\ncoarse checked shirts, and large canvass trousers that look as if\r\nthey were made for a pair of bodies instead of a pair of legs, are\r\nthe staple commodities. Then, there are large bunches of cotton\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, in colour and pattern unlike any one ever saw\r\nbefore, with the exception of those on the backs of the three young\r\nladies without bonnets who passed just now. The furniture is much the\r\nsame as elsewhere, with the addition of one or two models of ships,\r\nand some old prints of naval engagements in still older frames. In the\r\nwindow are a few compasses, a small tray containing silver watches in\r\nclumsy thick cases; and tobacco-boxes, the lid of each ornamented with\r\na ship, or an anchor, or some such trophy. A sailor generally pawns or\r\nsells all he has before he has been long ashore, and if he does not,\r\nsome favoured companion kindly saves him the trouble. In either case,\r\nit is an even chance that he afterwards unconsciously repurchases the\r\nsame things at a higher price than he gave for them at first.\r\n\r\n“Again: pay a visit, with a similar object, to a part of London, as\r\nunlike both of these as they are to each other. Cross over to the Surry\r\nside, and look at such shops of this description as are to be found\r\nnear the King’s Bench prison, and in ‘the Rules.’ How different, and\r\nhow strikingly illustrative of the decay of some of the unfortunate\r\nresidents in this part of the metropolis! Imprisonment and neglect have\r\ndone their work. There is contamination in the profligate denizens of\r\na debtors’ prison; old friends have fallen off; the recollection of\r\nformer prosperity has passed away; and with it all thoughts for the\r\npast, all care for the future. First, watches and rings, then cloaks,\r\ncoats, and all the more expensive articles of dress, have found their\r\nway to the pawnbroker’s. That miserable resource has failed at last,\r\nand the sale of some trifling article at one of these shops, has been\r\nthe only mode left of raising a shilling or two, to meet the urgent\r\ndemands of the moment. Dressing-cases and writing-desks, too old to\r\npawn but too good to keep; guns, fishing-rods, musical instruments, all\r\nin the same condition; have first been sold, and the sacrifice has been\r\nbut slightly felt. But hunger must be allayed, and what has already\r\nbecome a habit, is easily resorted to, when an emergency arises. Light\r\narticles of clothing, first of the ruined man, then of his wife, at\r\nlast of their children, even of the youngest, have been parted with,\r\npiecemeal. There they are, thrown carelessly together until a purchaser\r\npresents himself, old, and patched and repaired, it is true; but the\r\nmake and materials tell of better days: and the older they are, the\r\ngreater the misery and destitution of those whom they once adorned.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND APPAREL.\r\n\r\nThe multifariousness of the articles of this trade is limited only by\r\nwhat the uncertainty of the climate, the caprices of fashion, or the\r\nestablished styles of apparel in the kingdom, have caused to be worn,\r\nflung aside, and reworn as a revival of an obsolete style. It is to\r\nbe remarked, however, that of the old-fashioned styles none that are\r\ncostly have been revived. Laced coats, and embroidered and lappeted\r\nwaistcoats, have long disappeared from second-hand traffic--the last\r\nstage of fashions--and indeed from all places but court or fancy balls\r\nand the theatre.\r\n\r\nThe great mart for second-hand apparel was, in the last century,\r\nin Monmouth-street; now, by one of those arbitrary, and almost\r\nalways inappropriate, changes in the nomenclature of streets, termed\r\nDudley-street, Seven Dials. “Monmouth-street finery” was a common term\r\nto express tawdriness and pretence. Now Monmouth-street, for its new\r\nname is hardly legitimated, has no finery. Its second-hand wares are\r\nalmost wholly confined to old boots and shoes, which are vamped up with\r\na good deal of trickery; so much so that a shoemaker, himself in the\r\npoorer practice of the “gentle craft,” told me that blacking and brown\r\npaper were the materials of Monmouth-street cobbling. Almost every\r\nmaster in Monmouth-street now is, I am told, an Irishman; and the great\r\nmajority of the workmen are Irishmen also. There were a few Jews and a\r\nfew cockneys in this well-known street a year or two back, but now this\r\nbranch of the second-hand trade is really in the hands of what may be\r\ncalled a clan. A little business is carried on in second-hand apparel,\r\nas well as boots and shoes, but it is insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe head-quarters of this second-hand trade are now in Petticoat and\r\nRosemary lanes, especially in Petticoat-lane, and the traffic there\r\ncarried on may be called enormous. As in other departments of commerce,\r\nboth in our own capital, in many of our older cities, and in the cities\r\nof the Continent, the locality appropriated to this traffic is one of\r\nnarrow streets, dark alleys, and most oppressive crowding. The traders\r\nseem to judge of a Rag-fair garment, whether a cotton frock or a ducal\r\ncoachman’s great-coat, by the touch, more reliably than by the sight;\r\nthey inspect, so to speak, with their fingers more than their eyes.\r\nBut the business in Petticoat and Rosemary lanes is mostly of a retail\r\ncharacter. The wholesale mart--for the trade in old clothes has both a\r\nwholesale and retail form--is in a place of especial curiosity, and one\r\nof which, as being little known, I shall first speak.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE OLD CLOTHES EXCHANGE.\r\n\r\nThe trade in second-hand apparel is one of the most ancient of\r\ncallings, and is known in almost every country, but anything like the\r\nOld Clothes Exchange of the Jewish quarter of London, in the extent and\r\norder of its business, is unequalled in the world. There is indeed no\r\nother such place, and it is rather remarkable that a business occupying\r\nso many persons, and requiring such facilities for examination and\r\narrangement, should not until the year 1843 have had its regulated\r\nproceedings. The Old Clothes Exchange is the latest of the central\r\nmarts, established in the metropolis.\r\n\r\nSmithfield, or the Cattle Exchange, is the oldest of all the markets;\r\nit is mentioned as a place for the sale of horses in the time of\r\nHenry II. Billingsgate, or the Fish Exchange, is of ancient, but\r\nuncertain era. Covent Garden--the largest Fruit, Vegetable, and\r\nFlower Exchange--first became established as the centre of such\r\ncommerce in the reign of Charles II.; the establishment of the Borough\r\nand Spitalfields markets, as other marts for the sale of fruits,\r\nvegetables, and flowers, being nearly as ancient. The Royal Exchange\r\ndates from the days of Queen Elizabeth, and the Bank of England and the\r\nStock-Exchange from those of William III., while the present premises\r\nfor the Corn and Coal Exchanges are modern.\r\n\r\nWere it possible to obtain the statistics of the last quarter of a\r\ncentury, it would, perhaps, be found that in none of the important\r\ninterests I have mentioned has there been a greater increase of\r\nbusiness than in the trade in old clothes. Whether this purports a high\r\ndegree of national prosperity or not, it is not my business at present\r\nto inquire, and be it as it may, it is certain that, until the last\r\nfew years, the trade in old clothes used to be carried on entirely in\r\nthe open air, and this in the localities which I have pointed out in\r\nmy account of the trade in old metal (p. 10, vol. ii.) as comprising\r\nthe Petticoat-lane district. The old clothes trade was also pursued in\r\nRosemary-lane, but then--and so indeed it is now--this was but a branch\r\nof the more centralized commerce of Petticoat-lane. The head-quarters\r\nof the traffic at that time were confined to a space not more than ten\r\nsquare yards, adjoining Cutler-street. The chief traffic elsewhere\r\nwas originally in Cutler-street, White-street, Carter-street, and in\r\nHarrow-alley--the districts of the celebrated Rag-fair.\r\n\r\nThe confusion and clamour before the institution of the present\r\narrangements were extreme. Great as was the extent of the business\r\ntransacted, people wondered how it could be accomplished, for it\r\nalways appeared to a stranger, that there could be no order whatever\r\nin all the disorder. The wrangling was incessant, nor were the\r\ntrade-contests always confined to wrangling alone. The passions of the\r\nIrish often drove them to resort to cuffs, kicks, and blows, which\r\nthe Jews, although with a better command over their tempers, were not\r\nslack in returning. The East India Company, some of whose warehouses\r\nadjoined the market, frequently complained to the city authorities\r\nof the nuisance. Complaints from other quarters were also frequent,\r\nand sometimes as many as 200 constables were necessary to restore or\r\nenforce order. The nuisance, however, like many a public nuisance,\r\nwas left to remedy itself, or rather it was left to be remedied by\r\nindividual enterprise. Mr. L. Isaac, the present proprietor, purchased\r\nthe houses which then filled up the back of Phil’s-buildings, and\r\nformed the present Old Clothes Exchange. This was eight years ago;\r\nnow there are no more policemen in the locality than in other equally\r\npopulous parts.\r\n\r\nOf Old Clothes Exchanges there are now two, both adjacent, the one\r\nfirst opened by Mr. Isaac being the most important. This is 100 feet by\r\n70, and is the mart to which the collectors of the cast-off apparel of\r\nthe metropolis bring their goods for sale. The goods are sold wholesale\r\nand retail, for an old clothes merchant will buy either a single\r\nhat, or an entire wardrobe, or a sackful of shoes,--I need not say\r\n_pairs_, for odd shoes are not rejected. In one department of “Isaac’s\r\nExchange,” however, the goods are not sold to parties who buy for their\r\nown wearing, but to the old clothes merchant, who buys to sell again.\r\nIn this portion of the mart are 90 stalls, averaging about six square\r\nfeet each.\r\n\r\nIn another department, which communicates with the first, and is\r\ntwo-thirds of the size, are assembled such traders as buy the old\r\ngarments to dispose of them, either after a process of cleaning, or\r\nwhen they have been repaired and renovated. These buyers are generally\r\nshopkeepers, residing in the old clothes districts of Marylebone-lane,\r\nHolywell-street, Monmouth-street, Union-street (Borough), Saffron-hill\r\n(Field-lane), Drury-lane, Shoreditch, the Waterloo-road, and other\r\nplaces of which I shall have to speak hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the first and second class of buyers above\r\nmentioned, is really that of the merchant and the retail shopkeeper.\r\nThe one buys literally anything presented to him which is vendible, and\r\nin any quantity, for the supply of the wholesale dealers from distant\r\nparts, or for exportation, or for the general trade of London. The\r\nother purchases what suits his individual trade, and is likely to suit\r\nregular or promiscuous customers.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the same market is carried on the _retail_ old\r\nclothes trade to any one--shopkeeper, artisan, clerk, costermonger,\r\nor gentlemen. This indeed, is partially the case in the other parts.\r\n“Yesh, inteet,” said a Hebrew trader, whom I conversed with on the\r\nsubject, “I shall be clad to shell you one coat, sir. Dish von is\r\nshust your shize; it is verra sheep, and vosh made by one tip-top\r\nshnip.” Indeed, the keenness and anxiety to trade--whenever trade seems\r\npossible--causes many of the frequenters of these marts to infringe the\r\narrangements as to the manner of the traffic, though the proprietors\r\nendeavour to cause the regulations to be strictly adhered to.\r\n\r\nThe second Exchange, which is a few yards apart from the other is known\r\nas Simmons and Levy’s Clothes Exchange, and is unemployed, for its more\r\nespecial business purposes, except in the mornings. The commerce is\r\nthen wholesale, for here are sold collections of unredeemed pledges in\r\nwearing apparel, consigned there by the pawnbrokers, or the buyers at\r\nthe auctions of unredeemed goods; as well as draughts from the stocks\r\nof the wardrobe dealers; a quantity of military or naval stores, and\r\nsuch like articles. In the afternoon the stalls are occupied by retail\r\ndealers. The ground is about as large as the first-mentioned exchange,\r\nbut is longer and narrower.\r\n\r\nIn neither of these places is there even an attempt at architectural\r\nelegance, or even neatness. The stalls and partitions are of unpainted\r\nwood, the walls are bare, the only care that seems to be manifested is\r\nthat the places should be dry. In the first instance the plainness was\r\nno doubt a necessity from motives of prudence, as the establishments\r\nwere merely speculations, and now everything but _business_ seems\r\nto be disregarded. The Old Clothes Exchanges have assuredly one\r\nrecommendation as they are now seen--their appropriateness. They have\r\na threadbare, patched, and _second-hand_ look. The dresses worn by the\r\ndealers, and the dresses they deal in, are all in accordance with the\r\ngenius of the place. But the eagerness, crowding, and energy, are the\r\ngrand features of the scene; and of all the many curious sights in\r\nLondon there is none so picturesque (from the various costumes of the\r\nbuyers and sellers), none so novel, and none so animated as that of the\r\nOld Clothes Exchange.\r\n\r\nBusiness is carried on in the wholesale department of the Old Clothes\r\nExchanges every day during the week; and in the retail on each day\r\nexcept the Hebrew Sabbath (Saturday). The Jews in the old clothes trade\r\nobserve strictly the command that on their Sabbath day they shall do no\r\nmanner of work, for on a visit I paid to the Exchange last Saturday,\r\nnot a single Jew could I see engaged in any business. But though\r\nthe Hebrew Sabbath is observed by the Jews and disregarded by the\r\nChristians, the Christian Sabbath, on the other hand, is disregarded\r\nby Jew and Christian alike, some few of the Irish excepted, who may\r\noccasionally go to early mass, and attend at the Exchange afterwards.\r\nSunday, therefore, in “Rag-fair,” is like the other days of the week\r\n(Saturday excepted); business closes on the Sunday, however, at 2\r\ninstead of 6.\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday the keen Jew-traders in the neighbourhood of the\r\nExchanges may be seen standing at their doors--after the synagogue\r\nhours--or looking out of their windows, dressed in their best. The\r\ndress of the men is for the most part not distinguishable from that of\r\nthe English on the Sunday, except that there may be a greater glitter\r\nof rings and watch-guards. The dress of the women is of every kind;\r\nbecoming, handsome, rich, tawdry, but seldom neat.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE WHOLESALE BUSINESS AT THE OLD CLOTHES EXCHANGE.\r\n\r\nA considerable quantity of the old clothes disposed of at the Exchange\r\nare bought by merchants from Ireland. They are then packed in bales by\r\nporters, regularly employed for the purpose, and who literally _build_\r\nthem up square and compact. These bales are each worth from 50_l._ to\r\n300_l._, though seldom 300_l._, and it is curious to reflect from how\r\nmany classes the pile of old garments has been collected--how many\r\nprivations have been endured before some of these habiliments found\r\ntheir way into the possession of the old clothesman--what besotted\r\ndebauchery put others in his possession--with what cool calculation\r\nothers were disposed of--how many were procured for money, and how\r\nmany by the tempting offers of flowers, glass, crockery, spars,\r\ntable-covers, lace, or millinery--what was the clothing which could\r\nfirst be spared when rent was to be defrayed or bread to be bought, and\r\nwhat was treasured until the last--in what scenes of gaiety or gravity,\r\nin the opera-house or the senate, had the perhaps departed wearers of\r\nsome of that heap of old clothes figured--through how many possessors,\r\nand again through what new scenes of middle-class or artizan comfort\r\nhad these dresses passed, or through what accidents of “genteel”\r\nprivation and destitution--and lastly through what necessities of\r\nsqualid wretchedness and low debauchery.\r\n\r\nEvery kind of old attire, from the highest to the _very lowest_, I was\r\nemphatically told, was sent to Ireland.\r\n\r\nSome of the bales are composed of garments originally made for the\r\nlabouring classes. These are made up of every description of colour and\r\nmaterial--cloth, corduroy, woollen cords, fustian, moleskin, flannel,\r\nvelveteen, plaids, and the several varieties of those substances.\r\nIn them are to be seen coats, great-coats, jackets, trousers, and\r\nbreeches, but no other habiliments, such as boots, shirts, or\r\nstockings. I was told by a gentleman, who between 40 and 50 years ago\r\nwas familiar with the liberty and poorer parts of Dublin, that the most\r\ncoveted and the most saleable of all second-hand apparel was that of\r\nleather breeches, worn commonly in some of the country parts of England\r\nhalf a century back, and sent in considerable quantities at that time\r\nfrom London to Ireland. These nether habiliments were coveted because,\r\nas the Dublin sellers would say, they “would wear for ever, and look\r\nilligant after that.” Buck-skin breeches are now never worn except\r\nby grooms in their liveries, and gentlemen when hunting, so that the\r\ntrade in them in the Old Clothes Exchange, and their exportation to\r\nIreland, are at an end. The next most saleable thing--I may mention,\r\nincidentally--vended cheap and second-hand in Dublin, to the poor\r\nIrishmen of the period I speak of, was a wig! And happy was the man who\r\ncould wear two, one over the other.\r\n\r\nSome of the Irish buyers who are regular frequenters of the London Old\r\nClothes Exchange, take a small apartment, often a garret or a cellar,\r\nin Petticoat-lane or its vicinity, and to this room they convey their\r\npurchases until a sufficient stock has been collected. Among these old\r\nclothes the Irish possessors cook, or at any rate eat, their meals,\r\nand upon them they sleep. I did not hear that such dealers were more\r\nthan ordinarily unhealthy; though it may, perhaps, be assumed that such\r\nhabits are fatal to health. What may be the average duration of life\r\namong old clothes sellers who live in the midst of their wares, I do\r\nnot know, and believe that no facts have been collected on the subject;\r\nbut I certainly saw among them some very old men.\r\n\r\nOther wholesale buyers from Ireland occupy decent lodgings in the\r\nneighbourhood--decent considering the locality. In Phil’s-buildings, a\r\nkind of wide alley which forms one of the approaches to the Exchange,\r\nare eight respectable apartments, almost always let to the Irish old\r\nclothes merchants.\r\n\r\nTradesmen of the same class come also from the large towns of England\r\nand Scotland to buy for their customers some of the left-off clothes of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nNor is this the extent of the wholesale trade. Bales of old clothes are\r\nexported to Belgium and Holland, but principally to Holland. Of the\r\nquantity of goods thus exported to the Continent not above one-half,\r\nperhaps, can be called old _clothes_, while among these the old livery\r\nsuits are in the best demand. The other goods of this foreign trade\r\nare old serges, duffles, carpeting, drugget, and heavy woollen goods\r\ngenerally, of all the descriptions which I have before enumerated as\r\nparcel of the second-hand trade of the streets. Old merino curtains,\r\nand any second-hand decorations of fringes, woollen lace, &c., are in\r\ndemand for Holland.\r\n\r\nTwelve bales, averaging somewhere about 100_l._ each in value, but not\r\nfully 100_l._, are sent direct every week of the year from the Old\r\nClothes Exchange to distant places, and this is not the whole of the\r\ntraffic, apart from what is done retail. I am informed on the best\r\nauthority, that the average trade may be stated at 1500_l._ a week all\r\nthe year round. When I come to the conclusion of the subject, however,\r\nI shall be able to present statistics of the amount turned over in the\r\nrespective branches of the old clothes trade, as well as of the number\r\nof the traffickers, only one-fourth of whom are now Jews.\r\n\r\nThe conversation which goes on in the Old Clothes Exchange during\r\nbusiness hours, apart from the “larking” of the young sweet-stuff and\r\norange or cake-sellers, is all concerning business, but there is,\r\neven while business is being transacted, a frequent interchange of\r\njokes, and even of practical jokes. The business talk--I was told by\r\nan old clothes collector, and I heard similar remarks--is often to the\r\nfollowing effect:--\r\n\r\n“How much is this here?” says the man who comes to buy. “One pound\r\nfive,” replies the Jew seller. “I won’t give you above half the money.”\r\n“Half de money,” cries the salesman, “I can’t take dat. Vat above\r\nthe 16_s._ dat you offer now vill you give for it? Vill you give me\r\neighteen? Vell, come, give ush your money, I’ve got ma rent to pay.”\r\nBut the man says, “I only bid you 12_s._ 6_d._, and I shan’t give no\r\nmore.” And then, if the seller finds he can get him to “spring” or\r\nadvance no further, he says, “I shupposh I musht take your money even\r\nif I loosh by it. You’ll be a better cushtomer anoder time.” [This is\r\nstill a common “deal,” I am assured by one who began the business at 13\r\nyears old, and is now upwards of 60 years of age. The Petticoat-laner\r\nwill always ask at least twice as much as he means to take.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed account of the mode of business as conducted at the\r\nOld Clothes Exchange I refer the reader to p. 368, vol. i. Subsequent\r\nvisits have shown me nothing to alter in that description, although\r\nwritten (in one of my letters in the _Morning Chronicle_), nearly two\r\nyears ago. I have merely to add that I have there mentioned the receipt\r\nof a halfpenny toll; but this, I find, is not levied on Saturdays and\r\nSundays.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI ought not to omit stating that pilfering one from another by the\r\npoor persons who have collected the second-hand garments, and have\r\ncarried them to the Old Clothes Exchange to dispose of, is of very\r\nrare occurrence. This is the more commendable, for many of the wares\r\ncould not be identified by their owner, as he had procured them only\r\nthat morning. If, as happens often enough, a man carried a dozen pairs\r\nof old shoes to the Exchange, and one pair were stolen, he might have\r\nsome difficulty in swearing to the identity of the pair purloined.\r\nIt is true that the Jews, and crock-men, and others, who collect, by\r\nsale or barter, masses of old clothes, note all their defects very\r\nminutely, and might have no moral doubt as to identity, nevertheless\r\nthe magistrate would probably conclude that the legal evidence--were it\r\nonly circumstantial--was insufficient. The young thieves, however, who\r\nflock from the low lodging-houses in the neighbourhood, are an especial\r\ntrouble in Petticoat-lane, where the people robbed are generally\r\ntoo busy, and the article stolen of too little value, to induce a\r\nprosecution--a knowledge which the juvenile pilferer is not slow in\r\nacquiring. Sometimes when these boys are caught pilfering, they are\r\nseverely beaten, especially by the women, who are aided by the men, if\r\nthe thief offers any formidable resistance, or struggles to return the\r\nblows.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE USES OF SECOND-HAND GARMENTS.\r\n\r\nI have now to describe the uses to which the several kinds of garments\r\nwhich constitute the commerce of the Old Clothes Exchange are devoted,\r\nwhether it be merely in the re-sale of the apparel, to be worn in its\r\noriginal form or in a repaired or renovated form; or whether it be\r\n“worked up” into other habiliments, or be useful for the making of\r\nother descriptions of woollen fabrics; or else whether it be fit merely\r\nfor its last stages--the rag-bag for the paper-maker, or the manure\r\nheap for the hop-grower.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEach “left-off” garment has its peculiar after _uses_, according to\r\nits material and condition. The practised eye of the old clothes man\r\nat once embraces every capability of the apparel, and the amount which\r\nthese capabilities will realize; whether they be woollen, linen,\r\ncotton, leathern, or silken goods; or whether they be articles which\r\ncannot be classed under any of those designations, such as macintoshes\r\nand furs.\r\n\r\nA _surtout_ coat is the most serviceable of any second-hand clothing,\r\noriginally good. It can be re-cuffed, re-collared, or the skirts\r\nre-lined with new or old silk, or with a substitute for silk. It can\r\nbe “restored” if the seams be white and the general appearance what is\r\nbest understood by the expressive word “seedy.” This restoration is a\r\nsort of re-dyeing, or rather re-colouring, by the application of gall\r\nand logwood with a small portion of copperas. If the under sleeve be\r\nworn, as it often is by those whose avocations are sedentary, it is\r\nrenewed, and frequently with a second-hand piece of cloth “to match,”\r\nso that there is no perceptible difference between the renewal and\r\nthe other parts. Many an honest artisan in this way becomes possessed\r\nof his Sunday frock-coat, as does many a smarter clerk or shopman,\r\nimpressed with a regard to his personal appearance.\r\n\r\nIn the last century, I may here observe, and perhaps in the early\r\npart of the present, when woollen cloth was much dearer, much more\r\nsubstantial, and therefore much more durable, it was common for\r\neconomists to have a good coat “turned.” It was taken to pieces by\r\nthe tailor and re-made, the inner part becoming the outer. This\r\nmode prevailed alike in France and England; for Molière makes his\r\nmiser, _Harpagon_, magnanimously resolve to incur the cost of his\r\nmany-years’-old coat being “turned,” for the celebration of his\r\nexpected marriage with a young and wealthy bride. This way of dealing\r\nwith a second-hand garment is not so general now as it was formerly in\r\nLondon, nor is it in the country.\r\n\r\nIf the surtout be incapable of restoration to the appearance of a\r\n“respectable” garment, the skirts are sold for the making of cloth\r\ncaps; or for the material of boys’ or “youths’” waistcoats; or for\r\n“poor country curates’ gaiters; but not so much now as they once\r\nwere. The poor journeymen parsons,” I was told, “now goes for the new\r\nslops; they’re often green, and is had by ’vertisements, and bills,\r\nand them books about fashions which is all over both country and town.\r\nDo you know, sir, why them there books is always made so small? The\r\nleaves is about four inches square. That’s to prevent their being any\r\nuse as waste paper. I’ll back a coat such as is sometimes sold by a\r\ngentleman’s servant to wear out two new slops.”\r\n\r\n_Cloaks_ are things of as ready sale as any kind of old garments. If\r\ngood, or even reparable, they are in demand both for the home and\r\nforeign trades, as cloaks; if too far gone, which is but rarely the\r\ncase, they are especially available for the same purposes as the\r\nsurtout. The same may be said of the great-coat.\r\n\r\n_Dress-coats_ are far less useful, as if cleaned up and repaired they\r\nare not in demand among the working classes, and the clerks and shopmen\r\non small salaries are often tempted by the price, I was told, to buy\r\nsome wretched new slop thing rather than a superior coat second-hand.\r\nThe dress-coats, however, are used for caps. Sometimes a coat, for\r\nwhich the collector may have given 9_d._, is cut up for the repairs of\r\nbetter garments.\r\n\r\n_Trousers_ are re-seated and repaired where the material is strong\r\nenough; and they are, I am informed, now about the only habiliment\r\nwhich is ever “turned,” and that but exceptionally. The repairs to\r\ntrousers are more readily effected than those to coats, and trousers\r\nare freely bought by the collectors, and as freely re-bought by the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n_Waistcoats_--I still speak of woollen fabrics--are sometimes used\r\nin cap-making, and were used in gaiter-making. But generally, at the\r\npresent time, the worn edges are cut away, the buttons renewed or\r\nreplaced by a new set, sometimes of glittering glass, the button-holes\r\nrepaired or their jaggedness gummed down, and so the waistcoat is\r\nreproduced as a waistcoat, a size smaller. Sometimes a “vest,” as\r\nwaistcoats are occasionally called, is used by the cheap boot-makers\r\nfor the “legs” of a woman’s cloth boots, either laced or buttoned, but\r\nnot a quarter as much as they would be, I was told, if the buttons and\r\nbutton-holes of the waistcoat would “do again” in the boot.\r\n\r\nNor is the woollen garment, if too thin, too worn, or too rotten\r\nto be devoted to any of the uses I have specified, flung away as\r\nworthless. To the traders in second-hand apparel, or in the remains\r\nof second-hand apparel, a dust-hole is an unknown receptacle. The\r\nwoollen rag, for so it is then considered, when unravelled can be made\r\navailable for the manufacture of cheap yarns, being mixed with new\r\nwool. It is more probable, however, that the piece of woollen fabric\r\nwhich has been rejected by those who make or mend, and who must make\r\nor mend so cheaply that the veriest vagrant may be their customer,\r\nis formed not only into a new material, but into a material which\r\nsometimes is made into a new garment. These garments are inferior to\r\nthose woven of new wool, both in look and wear; but in some articles\r\nthe re-manufacture is beautiful. The fabric thus snatched, as it\r\nwere, from the ruins of cloth, is known as shoddy, the chief seat of\r\nmanufacture being in Dewsbury, a small town in Yorkshire. The old\r\nmaterial, when duly prepared, is torn into wool again by means of fine\r\nmachinery, but the recovered wool is shorter in its fibre and more\r\nbrittle in its nature; it is, indeed, more a woollen pulp than a wool.\r\n\r\nTouching this peculiar branch of manufacture, I will here cite from the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_ a brief description of a Shoddy Mill, so that the\r\nreader may have as comprehensive a knowledge as possible of the several\r\nuses to which his left-off clothes may be put.\r\n\r\n“The small town of Dewsbury holds, in the woollen district, very\r\nmuch the same position which Oldham does in the cotton country--the\r\nspinning and preparing of waste and refuse materials. To this stuff\r\nthe name of “shoddy” is given, but the real and orthodox “shoddy” is a\r\nproduction of the woollen districts, and consists of the second-hand\r\nwool manufactured by the tearing up, or rather the grinding, of woollen\r\nrags by means of coarse willows, called devils; the operation of which\r\nsends forth choking clouds of dry pungent dirt and floating fibres--the\r\nreal and original “devil’s dust.” Having been, by the agency of the\r\nmachinery in question, reduced to something like the original raw\r\nmaterial, fresh wool is added to the pulp in different proportions,\r\naccording to the quality of the stuff to be manufactured, and the\r\nmingled material is at length reworked in the usual way into a little\r\nserviceable cloth.\r\n\r\n“There are some shoddy mills in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, but\r\nthe mean little town of Dewsbury may be taken as the metropolis of the\r\nmanufacture. Some mills are devoted solely to the sorting, preparing,\r\nand grinding of rags, which are worked up in the neighbouring\r\nfactories. Here great bales, choke full of filthy tatters, lie\r\nscattered about the yard, while the continual arrival of loaded waggons\r\nkeeps adding to the heap. A glance at the exterior of these mills shows\r\ntheir character. The walls and part of the roof are covered with the\r\nthick clinging dust and fibre, which ascends in choky volumes from the\r\nopen doors and glassless windows of the ground floor, and which also\r\npours forth from a chimney, constructed for the purpose, exactly like\r\nsmoke. The mill is covered as with a mildewy fungus, and upon the gray\r\nslates of the roof the frowzy deposit is often not less than two inches\r\nin depth.\r\n\r\n“In the upper story of these mills the rags are stored. A great\r\nware-room is piled in many places from the floor to the ceiling with\r\nbales of woollen rags, torn strips and tatters of every colour peeping\r\nout from the bursting depositories. There is hardly a country in\r\nEurope which does not contribute its quota of material to the shoddy\r\nmanufacturer. Rags are brought from France, Germany, and in great\r\nquantities from Belgium. Denmark, I understand, is favourably looked\r\nupon by the tatter merchants, being fertile in morsels of clothing,\r\nof fair quality. Of domestic rags, the Scotch bear off the palm; and\r\npossibly no one will be surprised to hear, that of all rags Irish rags\r\nare the most worn, the filthiest, and generally the most unprofitable.\r\nThe gradations of value in the world of rags are indeed remarkable.\r\nI was shown rags worth 50_l._ per ton, and rags worth only 30_s._\r\nThe best class is formed of the remains of fine cloth, the produce\r\nof which, eked out with a few bundles of fresh wool, is destined\r\nto go forth to the world again as broad cloth, or at all events as\r\npilot cloth. Fragments of damask and skirts of merino dresses form\r\nthe staple of middle-class rags; and even the very worst bales--they\r\nappear unmitigated mashes of frowzy filth--afford here and there\r\nsome fragments of calico, which are wrought up into brown paper. The\r\nrefuse of all, mixed with the stuff which even the shoddy-making devil\r\nrejects, is packed off to the agricultural districts for use as manure,\r\nto fertilize the hop-gardens of Kent.\r\n\r\n“Under the rag ware-room is the sorting and picking room. Here the\r\nbales are opened, and their contents piled in close, poverty-smelling\r\nmasses, upon the floor. The operatives are entirely women. They sit\r\nupon low stools, or half sunk and half enthroned amid heaps of the\r\nfilthy goods, busily employed in arranging them according to the colour\r\nand the quality of the morsels, and from the more pretending quality\r\nof rags carefully ripping out every particle of cotton which they can\r\ndetect. Piles of rags of different sorts, dozens of feet high, are the\r\nobvious fruits of their labour. All these women are over eighteen years\r\nof age, and the wages which they are paid for ten hours’ work are 6_s._\r\nper week. They look squalid and dirty enough; but all of them chatter\r\nand several sing over their noisome labour. The atmosphere of the room\r\nis close and oppressive; and although no particularly offensive smell\r\nis perceptible, there is a choky, mildewy sort of odour--a hot, moist\r\nexhalation--arising from the sodden smouldering piles, as the workwomen\r\ntoss armfuls of rags from one heap to another. This species of work is\r\nthe lowest and foulest which any phase of the factory system can show.\r\n\r\n“The devils are upon the ground floor. The choking dust bursts out from\r\ndoor and window, and it is not until a minute or so that the visitor\r\ncan see the workmen moving amid the clouds, catching up armfuls of the\r\nsorted rags and tossing them into the machine to be torn into fibry\r\nfragments by the whirling revolutions of its teeth. The place in which\r\nthis is done is a large bare room--the uncovered beams above, the rough\r\nstone walls, and the woodwork of the unglazed windows being as it were\r\nfurred over with clinging woolly matter. On the floor, the dust and\r\ncoarse filaments lie as if ‘it had been snowing snuff.’ The workmen are\r\ncoated with the flying powder. They wear bandages over their mouths,\r\nso as to prevent as much as possible the inhalation of the dust, and\r\nseem loath to remove the protection for a moment. The rag grinders,\r\nwith their squalid, dust-strewn garments, powdered to a dull grayish\r\nhue, and with their bandages tied over the greater part of their faces,\r\nmove about like reanimated mummies in their swathings, looking most\r\nghastly. The wages of these poor creatures do not exceed 7_s._ or 8_s._\r\na week. The men are much better paid, none of them making less than\r\n18_s._ a week, and many earning as much as 22_s._ Not one of them,\r\nhowever, will admit that he found the trade injurious. The dust tickles\r\nthem a little, they say, that is all. They feel it most of a Monday\r\nmorning, after being all Sunday in the fresh air. When they first take\r\nto the work it hurts their throats a little, but they drink mint tea,\r\nand that soon cures them. They are all more or less subject to ‘shoddy\r\nfever,’ they confess, especially after tenting the grinding of the\r\nvery dusty sorts of stuff--worsted stockings, for example. The shoddy\r\nfever is a sort of stuffing of the head and nose, with sore throat, and\r\nit sometimes forces them to give over work for two or three days, or\r\nat most a week; but the disorder, the workmen say, is not fatal, and\r\nleaves no particularly bad effects.\r\n\r\n“In spite of all this, however, it is manifestly impossible for\r\nhuman lungs to breathe under such circumstances without suffering.\r\nThe visitor exposed to the atmosphere for ten minutes experiences\r\nan unpleasant choky sensation in the throat, which lasts all the\r\nremainder of the day. The rag grinders, moreover, according to the\r\nbest accounts, are very subject to asthmatic complaints, particularly\r\nwhen the air is dull and warm. The shoddy fever is said to be like a\r\nbad cold, with constant acrid running from the nose, and a great deal\r\nof expectoration. It is when there is a particularly dirty lot of rags\r\nto be ground that the people are usually attacked in this way, but the\r\nfever seldom keeps them more than two or three days from their work.\r\n\r\n“In other mills the rags are not only ground, but the shoddy is worked\r\nup into coarse bad cloth, a great proportion of which is sent to\r\nAmerica for slave clothing (and much now sold to the slop-shops).\r\n\r\n“After the rags have been devilled into shoddy, the remaining processes\r\nare much the same, although conducted in a coarser way, as those\r\nperformed in the manufacture of woollen cloth. The weaving is, for the\r\nmost part, carried on at the homes of the workpeople. The domestic\r\narrangements consist, in every case, of two tolerably large rooms, one\r\nabove the other, with a cellar beneath--a plan of construction called\r\nin Yorkshire a “house and a chamber.” The chamber has generally a bed\r\namid the looms. The weavers complain of irregular work and diminished\r\nwages. Their average pay, one week with another, with their wives to\r\nwind for them--_i. e._, to place the thread upon the bobbin which\r\ngoes into the shuttle--is hardly so much as 10_s._ a week. They work\r\nlong hours, often fourteen per day. Sometimes the weaver is a small\r\ncapitalist with perhaps half a dozen looms, and a hand-jenny for\r\nspinning thread, the workpeople being within his own family as regular\r\napprentices and journeymen.”\r\n\r\nDr. Hemingway, a gentleman who has a large practice in the shoddy\r\ndistrict, has given the following information touching the “shoddy\r\nfever”:--\r\n\r\n“The disease popularly known as ‘shoddy fever,’ and which is of\r\nfrequent occurrence, is a species of bronchitis, caused by the\r\nirritating effect of the floating particles of dust upon the mucous\r\nmembrane of the trachea and its ramifications. In general, the\r\nattack is easily cured--particularly if the patient has not been for\r\nany length of time exposed to the exciting cause--by effervescing\r\nsaline draughts to allay the symptomatic febrile action, followed by\r\nexpectorants to relieve the mucous membrane of the irritating dust;\r\nbut a long continuance of employment in the contaminated atmosphere,\r\nbringing on as it does repeated attacks of the disease, is too apt,\r\nin the end, to undermine the constitution, and produce a train of\r\npectoral diseases, often closing with pulmonary consumption. Ophthalmic\r\nattacks are by no means uncommon among the shoddy-grinders, some of\r\nwhom, however, wear wire-gauze spectacles to protect the eyes. As\r\nregards the effect of the occupation upon health, it may shorten life\r\nby about five years on a rough average, taking, of course, as the point\r\nof comparison, the average longevity of the district in which the\r\nmanufacture is carried on.”\r\n\r\n“Shoddy fever” is, in fact, a modification of the very fatal disease\r\ninduced by what is called “dry grinding” at Sheffield; but of course\r\nthe particles of woollen filament are less fatal in their influence\r\nthan the floating steel dust produced by the operation in question.\r\n\r\nAt one time shoddy cloth was not good and firm enough to be used for\r\nother purposes than such as padding by tailors, and in the inner\r\nlinings of carriages, by coach-builders. It was not used for purposes\r\nwhich would expose it to stress, but only to a moderate wear or\r\nfriction. Now shoddy, which modern improvements have made susceptible\r\nof receiving a fine dye (it always looked a dead colour at one\r\nperiod), is made into cloth for soldiers’ and sailors’ uniforms and\r\nfor pilot-coats; into blanketing, drugget, stair and other carpeting,\r\nand into those beautiful table-covers, with their rich woollen look,\r\non which elegantly drawn and elaborately coloured designs are printed\r\nthrough the application of aquafortis. Thus the rags which the beggar\r\ncould no longer hang about him to cover his nakedness, may be a\r\ncomponent of the soldier’s or sailor’s uniform, the carpet of a palace,\r\nor the library table-cover of a prime-minister.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another use for old woollen clothes. What is not good\r\nfor shoddy is good for manure, and more especially for the manure\r\nprepared by the agriculturists in Kent, Sussex, and Herefordshire,\r\nfor the culture of a difficult plant--hops. It is good also for corn\r\nland (judiciously used), so that we again have the remains of the old\r\ngarment in our beer or our bread.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have hitherto spoken of _woollen_ fabrics. The garments of other\r\nmaterials are seldom diverted from their original use, for as long as\r\nthey will hold together they can be sold for exportation to Ireland,\r\nthough of course for very trifling amounts.\r\n\r\nThe black _Velvet_ and _Satin Waistcoats_--the latter now so commonly\r\nworn--are almost always resold as waistcoats, and oft enough, when\r\nrebound and rebuttoned, make a very respectable looking garment.\r\nNothing sells better to the working-classes than a _good_ second-hand\r\nvest of the two materials of satin or velvet. If the satin, however,\r\nbe so worn and frayed that mending is impossible, the back, if not in\r\nthe same plight, is removed for rebacking of any waistcoat, and the\r\nsatin thrown away, one of the few things which in its last stage is\r\nutterly valueless. It is the same with silk waistcoats, and for the\r\nmost part with velvet, but a velvet waistcoat may be thrown in the\r\nrefuse heap with the woollen rags for manure. The coloured waistcoats\r\nof silk or velvet are dealt with in the same way. At one time,\r\nwhen under-waistcoats were worn, the edges being just discernible,\r\nquantities were made out of the full waistcoats where a sufficiency\r\nof the stuff was unworn. This fashion is now becoming less and\r\nless followed, and is principally in vogue in the matter of white\r\nunder-waistcoats. For the jean and other vests--even if a mixture of\r\nmaterials--there is the same use as what I have described of the black\r\nsatin, and failing that, they are generally transferable to the rag-bag.\r\n\r\n_Hats_ have become in greater demand than ever among the street-buyers\r\nsince the introduction into the London trade, and to so great an\r\nextent, of the silk, velvet, French, or Parisian hats. The construction\r\nof these hats is the same, and the easy way in which the hat-bodies are\r\nmade, has caused a number of poor persons, with no previous knowledge\r\nof hat-making, to enter into the trade. “There’s hundreds starving at\r\nit,” said a hat-manufacturer to me, “in Bermondsey, Lock’s-fields, and\r\nthe Borough; ay, hundreds.” This facility in the making of the bodies\r\nof the new silk hats is quite as available in the restoration of the\r\nbodies of the old hats, as I shall show from the information of a\r\nhighly-intelligent artisan, who told me that of all people he disliked\r\nrich slop-sellers; but there was another class which he disliked more,\r\nand that was rich slop-buyers.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the stuff or beaver hats of the best quality are made\r\nof a firm felt, wrought up of fine wool, rabbits’ hair, &c., and at\r\nonce elastic, firm, and light. Over this is placed the nap, prepared\r\nfrom the hair of the beaver. The bodies of the silk hats are made of\r\ncalico, which is blocked (as indeed is the felt) and stiffened and\r\npasted up until “only a hat-maker can tell,” as it was expressed to\r\nme, “good sound bodies from bad; and the slop-masters go for the cheap\r\nand bad.” The covering is not a nap of any hair, but is of silk or\r\nvelvet (the words are used indifferently in the trade) manufactured for\r\nthe purpose. Thus if an old hat be broken, or rather crushed out of\r\nall shape, the body can be glazed and sized up again so as to suit the\r\nslop hatter, if sold to him as a body, and that whether it be of felt\r\nor calico. If, however, the silk cover of the hat be not worn utterly\r\naway, the body, without stripping off the cover, can be re-blocked\r\nand re-set, and the silk-velvet trimmed up and “set,” or re-dyed, and\r\na decent hat is sometimes produced by these means. More frequently,\r\nhowever, a steeping shower of rain destroys the whole fabric.\r\n\r\n_Second-hand Caps_ are rarely brought into this trade.\r\n\r\nSuch things as _drawers_, _flannel waistcoats_, and what is sometimes\r\ncalled “inner wear,” sell very well when washed up, patched--for\r\npatches do not matter in a garment hidden from the eye when worn--or\r\nmended in any manner. Flannel waistcoats and drawers are often in\r\ndemand by the street-sellers and the street-labourers, as they are\r\nconsidered “good against the rheumatics.” These habiliments are often\r\nsold unrepaired, having been merely washed, as the poor men’s wives may\r\nbe competent to execute an easy bit of tailoring; or perhaps the men\r\nthemselves, if they have been reared as mechanics; and they believe\r\n(perhaps erroneously) that so they obtain a better bargain. _Shirts_\r\nare repaired and sold as shirts, or for old linen; the trade is not\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n_Men’s Stockings_ are darned up, but only when there is little to be\r\ndone in darning, as they are retailed at 2_d._ the pair. The sale is\r\nnot very great, for the supply is not. “Lots might be sold,” I was\r\ninformed, “if they was to be had, for them flash coves never cares what\r\nthey wears under their Wellingtons.”\r\n\r\n_The Women’s Apparel_ is sold to be re-worn in its original form quite\r\nas frequently, or more frequently, than it is mended up by the sellers;\r\nthe purchasers often preferring to make the alterations themselves. A\r\ngown of stuff, cotton, or any material, if full-sized, is frequently\r\nbought and altered to fit a smaller person or a child, and so the\r\nworn parts may be cut away. It is very rarely also that the apparel\r\nof the middle-classes is made into any other article, with the sole\r\nexception, perhaps, of _silk gowns_. If a silk gown be not too much\r\nfrayed, it is easily cleaned and polished up, so as to present a new\r\ngloss, and is sold readily enough; but if it be too far gone for this\r\nprocess, the old clothes renovator is often puzzled as to what uses to\r\nput it. A portion of a black silk dress may be serviceable to re-line\r\nthe cuffs of the better kind of coats. There is seldom enough, I was\r\ntold, to re-line the two skirts of a surtout, and it is difficult to\r\nmatch old silk; a man used to buying a good second-hand surtout, I was\r\nassured, would soon detect a difference in the shade of the silk, if\r\nthe skirts were re-lined from the remains of different gowns, and say,\r\n“I’ll not give any such money for that piebald thing.” Skirts may be\r\nsometimes re-lined this way on the getting up of frock coats, but very\r\nrarely. There is the same difficulty in using a coloured silk gown\r\nfor the re-covering of a parasol. The quantity may not be enough for\r\nthe gores, and cannot be matched to satisfy the eye, for the buyer of\r\na silk parasol even in Rosemary-lane may be expected to be critical.\r\nWhen there is enough of good silk for the purposes I have mentioned,\r\nthen, it must be borne in mind, the gown may be more valuable, because\r\nsaleable to be re-worn as a gown. It is the same with satin dresses,\r\nbut only a few of them, in comparison with the silk, are to be seen at\r\nthe Old Clothes’ Exchange.\r\n\r\nAmong the purposes to which portions of worn silk gowns are put are\r\nthe making of spencers for little girls (usually by the purchasers,\r\nor by the dress-maker, who goes out to work for 1_s._ a day), of\r\nchildren’s bonnets, for the lining of women’s bonnets, the re-lining\r\nof muffs and fur-tippets, the patching of quilts (once a rather\r\nfashionable thing), the inner lining or curtains to a book-case, and\r\nother household appliances of a like kind. This kind of silk, too, no\r\nmatter in how minute pieces, is bought by the fancy cabinet-makers (the\r\nsmall masters) for the lining of their dressing-cases and work-boxes\r\nsupplied to the warehouses, but these poor artisans have neither means\r\nnor leisure to buy such articles of those connected with the traffic\r\nof the Old Clothes’ Exchange, but must purchase it, of course at an\r\nenhanced price, of a broker who has bought it at the Exchange, or in\r\nsome establishment connected with it. The second-hand silk is bought\r\nalso for the dressing of dolls for the toy-shops, and for the lining of\r\nsome toys. The hat-manufacturers of the cheaper sort, at one time, used\r\nsecond-hand silk for the padded lining of hats, but such is rarely the\r\npractice now. It was once used in the same manner by the bookbinders\r\nfor lining the inner part of the back of a book. If there be any part\r\nof silk in a dress not suitable for any of these purposes it is wasted,\r\nor what is accounted wasted, although it may have been in wear for\r\nyears. It is somewhat remarkable, that while woollen and even cotton\r\ngoods can be “shoddied”--and if they are too rotten for that, they are\r\nmade available for manure, or in the manufacture of paper--no use is\r\nmade of the refuse of silk. Though one of the most beautiful and costly\r\nof textile fabrics, its “remains” are thrown aside, when a beggar’s\r\nrags are preserved and made profitable. There can be little doubt that\r\nsilk, like cotton, could be shoddied, but whether such a speculation\r\nwould be remunerative or not is no part of my present inquiry.\r\n\r\nThere is not, as I shall subsequently show, so great an exportation of\r\nfemale attire as might be expected in comparison with male apparel; the\r\npoorer classes of the metropolis being too anxious to get any decent\r\ngown when within their slender means.\r\n\r\n_Stays_, unless of superior make and in good condition, are little\r\nbought by the classes who are the chief customers of the old-clothes’\r\nmen in London. I did not hear any reason for this from any of the\r\nold-clothes’ people. One man thought, if there was a family of\r\ndaughters, the stays which had became too small for the elder girl were\r\naltered for the younger, and that poor women liked to mend their old\r\nstays as long as they would stick together. Perhaps, there may be some\r\nrepugnance--especially among the class of servant-maids who have not\r\nhad “to rough it”--to wear street-collected stays; a repugnance not,\r\nperhaps, felt in the wearing of a gown which probably can be washed,\r\nand is not worn so near the person. The stays that are collected are\r\nfor the most part exported, a great portion being sent to Ireland. If\r\nthey are “worn to rags,” the bones are taken out; but in the slop-made\r\nstays, it is not whalebone, but wood that is used to give, or preserve\r\nthe due shape of the corset, and then the stays are valueless.\r\n\r\n_Old Stockings_ are of great sale both for home wear and foreign trade.\r\nIn the trade of women’s stockings there has been in the last 20 or 25\r\nyears a considerable change. Before that period black stockings were\r\nworn by servant girls, and the families of working people and small\r\ntradesmen; they “saved washing.” Now, even in Petticoat-lane, women’s\r\nstockings are white, or “mottled,” or some light-coloured, very rarely\r\nblack. I have heard this change attributed to what is rather vaguely\r\ncalled “pride.” May it not be owing to a more cultivated sense of\r\ncleanliness? The women’s stockings are sold darned and undarned, and\r\nat (retail) prices from 1_d._ to 4_d._; 1_d._ or 2_d._ being the most\r\nfrequent prices.\r\n\r\nThe _petticoats_ and other under clothing are not much bought\r\nsecond-hand by the poor women of London, and are exported.\r\n\r\n_Women’s caps_ used to be sold second-hand, I was told, both in the\r\nstreets and the shops, but long ago, and before muslin and needlework\r\nwere so cheap.\r\n\r\nI heard of one article which formerly supplied considerable “stuff”\r\n(the word used) for second-hand purposes, and was a part, but never\r\na considerable part, of the trade at Rag-fair. These were the\r\n“_pillions_,” or large, firm, solid cushions which were attached to a\r\nsaddle, so that a horse “carried double.” Fifty years ago the farmer\r\nand his wife, of the more prosperous order, went regularly to church\r\nand market on one horse, a pillion sustaining the good dame. To the\r\nbest sort of these pillions was appended what was called the “pillion\r\ncloth,” often of a fine, but thin quality, which being really a sort of\r\nhousing to the horse, cut straight and with few if any seams, was an\r\nexcellent material for what I am informed was formerly called “making\r\nand mending.” The colour was almost exclusively drab or blue. The\r\npillion on which the squire’s lady rode--and Sheridan makes his _Lady\r\nTeazle_ deny “the pillion and the coach-horse,” the butler being her\r\ncavalier--was a perfect piece of upholstery, set off with lace and\r\nfringes, which again were excellent for second-hand sale. Such a means\r\nof conveyance may still linger in some secluded country parts, but it\r\nis generally speaking obsolete.\r\n\r\n_Boots_ and _Shoes_ are not to be had, I am told, in sufficient\r\nquantity for the demand from the slop-shops, the “translators,” and\r\nthe second-hand dealers. Great quantities of second-hand boots and\r\nshoes are sent to Ireland to be “translated” there. Of all the wares\r\nin this traffic, the clothing for the feet is what is most easily\r\nprepared to cheat the eye of the inexperienced, the imposition having\r\nthe aids of heel-ball, &c., to fill up crevices, and of blacking to\r\nhide defects. Even when the boots or shoes are so worn out that no\r\none will put a pair on his feet, though purchaseable for about 1_d._,\r\nthe insoles are ripped out; the soles, if there be a sufficiency of\r\nleather, are shaped into insoles for children’s shoes, and these\r\ninsoles are sold in bundles of two dozen pairs at 2_d._ the bundle.\r\nSo long as the boot or shoe be not in many holes, it can be cobblered\r\nup in Monmouth-street or elsewhere. Of the “translating” business\r\ntransacted in those localities I had the following interesting account\r\nfrom a man who was lately engaged in it.\r\n\r\n“Translation, as I understand it (said my informant), is this--to\r\ntake a worn, old pair of shoes or boots, and by repairing them make\r\nthem appear as if left off with hardly any wear--as if they were\r\nonly soiled. I’ll tell you the way they manage in Monmouth-street.\r\nThere are in the trade ‘horses’ heads’--a ‘horse’s head’ is the foot\r\nof a boot with sole and heel, and part of a front--the back and the\r\nremainder of the front having been used for refooting boots. There\r\nare also ‘stand-bottoms’ and ‘lick-ups.’ A ‘stand-bottom’ is where\r\nthe shoe appears to be only soiled, and a ‘lick-up’ is a boot or shoe\r\nre-lasted to take the wrinkles out, the edges of the soles having\r\nbeen rasped and squared, and then blacked up to hide blemishes, and\r\nthe bottom covered with a ‘smother,’ which I will describe. There\r\nis another article called a ‘flyer,’ that is, a shoe soled without\r\nhaving been welted. In Monmouth-street a ‘horse’s head’ is generally\r\nretailed at 2_s._ 6_d._, but some fetch 4_s._ 6_d._--that’s the\r\nextreme price. They cost the translator from 1_s._ a dozen pair to\r\n8_s._, but those at 8_s._ are good, and are used for the making up\r\nof Wellington boots. Some ‘horses’ heads’--such as are cut off that\r\nthe boots may be re-footed on account of old fashion, or a misfit,\r\nwhen hardly worn--fetch 2_s._ 6_d._ a pair, and they are made up as\r\nnew-footed boots, and sell from 10_s._ to 15_s._ The average price\r\nof feet (that is, for the ‘horse’s head,’ as we call it) is 4_d._,\r\nand a pair of backs say 2_d._; the back is attached loosely by chair\r\nstitching, as it is called, to the heel, instead of being stitched to\r\nthe in-sole, as in a new boot. The wages for all this is 1_s._ 4_d._\r\nin Monmouth-street (in Union-street, Borough, 1_s._ 6_d._); but I was\r\ntold by a master that he had got the work done in Gray’s-inn-lane at\r\n9_d._ Put it, however, at 1_s._ 4_d._ wages--then, with 4_d._ and 2_d._\r\nfor the feet and back, we have 1_s._ 10_d._ outlay (the workman finds\r\nhis own grindery), and 8_d._ profit on each pair sold at a rate of\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ Some masters will sell from 70 to 80 pairs per week: that’s\r\nunder the mark; and that’s in ‘horses’ heads’ alone. One man employs,\r\nor did lately employ, seven men on ‘horses’ heads’ solely. The profit\r\ngenerally, in fair shops, in ‘stand-bottoms,’ is from 1_s._ 6_d._ to\r\n2_s._ per pair, as they sell generally at 3_s._ 6_d._ One man takes,\r\nor did take, 100_l._ in a day (it was calculated as an average) over\r\nthe counter, and all for the sort of shoes I have described. The profit\r\nof a ‘lick-up’ is the same as that of a ‘stand-bottom.’ To show the\r\nvillanous way the ‘stand-bottoms’ are got up, I will tell you this. You\r\nhave seen a broken upper-leather; well, we place a piece of leather,\r\nwaxed, underneath the broken part, on which we set a few stitches\r\nthrough and through. When dry and finished, we take what is called a\r\n‘soft-heel-ball’ and ‘smother’ it over, so that it sometimes would\r\ndeceive a currier, as it appears like the upper leather. With regard\r\nto the bottoms, the worn part of the sole is opened from the edge, a\r\npiece of leather is made to fit exactly into the hole or worn part, and\r\nit is then nailed and filed until level. Paste is then applied, and\r\n‘smother’ put over the part, and that imitates the dust of the road.\r\nThis ‘smother’ is obtained from the dust of the room. It is placed in\r\na silk stocking, tied at both ends, and then shook through, just like\r\na powder-puff, only we shake at both ends. It is powdered out into\r\nour leather apron, and mixed with a certain preparation which I will\r\ndescribe to you (he did so), but I would rather not have it published,\r\nas it would lead others to practise similar deceptions. I believe\r\nthere are about 2000 translators, so you may judge of the extent of\r\nthe trade; and translators are more constantly employed than any other\r\nbranch of the business. Many make a great deal of money. A journeyman\r\ntranslator can earn from 3_s._ to 4_s._ a day. You can give the average\r\nat 20_s._ a week, as the wages are good. It must be good, for we have\r\n2_s._ for soling, heeling, and welting a pair of boots; and some men\r\ndon’t get more for making them. Monmouth-street is nothing like what\r\nit was; as to curious old garments, that’s all gone. There’s not one\r\nEnglish master in the translating business in Monmouth-street--they are\r\nall Irish; and there is now hardly an English workman there--perhaps\r\nnot one. I believe that all the tradesmen in Monmouth-street make\r\ntheir workmen lodge with them. I was lodging with one before I married\r\na little while ago, and I know the system to be the same now as it\r\nwas then, unless, indeed, it be altered for the worse. To show how\r\ndisgusting these lodgings must be, I will state this:--I knew a\r\nRoman Catholic, who was attentive to his religious duties, but when\r\npronounced on the point of death, and believing firmly that he was\r\ndying, he would not have his priest administer extreme unction, for\r\nthe room was in such a filthy and revolting state he would not allow\r\nhim to see it. Five men worked and slept in that room, and they were\r\nworking and sleeping there in the man’s illness--all the time that\r\nhis life was despaired of. He was ill nine weeks. Unless the working\r\nshoemaker lodged there he would not be employed. Each man pays 2_s._ a\r\nweek. I was there once, but I couldn’t sleep in such a den; and five\r\nnights out of the seven I slept at my mother’s, but my lodging had to\r\nbe paid all the same. These men (myself excepted) were all Irish, and\r\nall teetotallers, as was the master. How often was the room cleaned\r\nout, do you say? Never, sir, never. The refuse of the men’s labour\r\nwas generally burnt, smudged away in the grate, smelling terribly.\r\nIt would stifle you, though it didn’t me, because I got used to it.\r\nI lodged in Union-street once. My employer had a room known as the\r\n‘barracks;’ every lodger paid him 2_s._ 6_d._ a week. Five men worked\r\nand slept there, and three were _sitters_--that is, men who paid 1_s._\r\na week to sit there and work, lodging elsewhere. A little before that\r\nthere were six sitters. The furniture was one table, one chair, and\r\ntwo beds. There was no place for purposes of decency: it fell to bits\r\nfrom decay, and was never repaired. This barrack man always stopped the\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ for lodging, if he gave you only that amount of work in the\r\nweek. The beds were decent enough; but as to Monmouth-street! you don’t\r\nsee a clean sheet there for nine weeks; and, recollect, such snobs are\r\ndirty fellows. There was no chair in the Monmouth-street room that\r\nI have spoken of, the men having only their seats used at work; but\r\nwhen the beds were let down for the night, the seats had to be placed\r\nin the fire-place because there was no space for them in the room. In\r\nmany houses in Monmouth-street there is a system of sub-letting among\r\nthe journeymen. In one room lodged a man and his wife (a laundress\r\nworked there), four children, and two single young men. The wife was\r\nactually delivered in this room whilst the men kept at their work--they\r\nnever lost an hour’s work; nor is this an unusual case--it’s not an\r\nisolated case at all. I could instance ten or twelve cases of two or\r\nthree married people living in one room in that street. The rats have\r\nscampered over the beds that lay huddled together in the kitchen. The\r\nhusband of the wife confined as I have described paid 4_s._ a week,\r\nand the two single men paid 2_s._ a week each, so the master was rent\r\nfree; and he received from each man 1_s._ 6_d._ a week for tea (without\r\nsugar), and no bread and butter, and 2_d._ a day for potatoes--that’s\r\nthe regular charge.”\r\n\r\nIn connection with the translation of old boots and shoes, I have\r\nobtained the following statistics. There are--\r\n\r\n  In Drury-lane and streets adjacent, about   50 shops.\r\n  Seven-dials         do.              do.   100  do.\r\n  Monmouth-street     do.              do.    40  do.\r\n  Hanway-court, Oxford-street          do.     4  do.\r\n  Lisson-grove        do.              do.   100  do.\r\n  Paddington          do.              do.    30  do.\r\n  Petticoat-lane (shops, stands, &c.)  do.   200  do.\r\n  Somers’-town        do.              do.    50  do.\r\n  Field-lane, Saffron-hill             do.    40  do.\r\n  Clerkenwell                          do.    30  do.\r\n  Bethnal-green, Spitalfields          do.   100  do.\r\n  Rosemary-lane, &c.                   do.    30  do.\r\n                                             ---\r\n                                             774 shops,\r\n\r\nemploying upwards of 2000 men in making-up and repairing old boots and\r\nshoes; besides hundreds of poor men and women who strive for a crust\r\nby buying and selling the old material, previously to translating it,\r\nand by mending up what will mend. They or their children stand in the\r\nstreet and try to sell them.\r\n\r\nMonmouth-street, now the great old shoe district, has been “sketched”\r\nby Mr. Dickens, not as regards its connection with the subject of\r\nstreet-sale or of any particular trade, but as to its general character\r\nand appearance. I first cite Mr. Dickens’ description of the Seven\r\nDials, of which Monmouth-street is a seventh:--\r\n\r\n“The stranger who finds himself in ‘The Dials’ for the first time,\r\nand stands, Belzoni-like, at the entrance of seven obscure passages,\r\nuncertain which to take, will see enough around him to keep his\r\ncuriosity and attention awake for no inconsiderable time. From the\r\nirregular square into which he has plunged, the streets and courts\r\ndart in all directions, until they are lost in the unwholesome vapour\r\nwhich hangs over the house-tops, and renders the dirty perspective\r\nuncertain and confined; and, lounging at every corner, as if they came\r\nthere to take a few gasps of such fresh air as has found its way so\r\nfar, but is too much exhausted already, to be enabled to force itself\r\ninto the narrow alleys around, are groups of people, whose appearance\r\nand dwellings would fill any mind but a regular Londoner’s with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“In addition to the numerous groups who are idling about the gin-shops\r\nand squabbling in the centre of the road, every post in the open\r\nspace has its occupant, who leans against it for hours, with listless\r\nperseverance. It is odd enough that one class of men in London appear\r\nto have no enjoyment beyond leaning against posts. We never saw a\r\nregular bricklayer’s labourer take any other recreation, fighting\r\nexcepted. Pass through St. Giles’s in the evening of a week-day,\r\nthere they are in their fustian dresses, spotted with brick-dust and\r\nwhitewash, leaning against posts. Walk through Seven Dials on Sunday\r\nmorning: there they are again, drab or light corduroy trowsers, Blucher\r\nboots, blue coats, and great yellow waistcoats, leaning against posts.\r\nThe idea of a man dressing himself in his best clothes, to lean against\r\na post all day!\r\n\r\n“The peculiar character of these streets, and the close resemblance\r\neach one bears to its neighbour, by no means tends to decrease the\r\nbewilderment in which the unexperienced wayfarer through ‘the Dials’\r\nfinds himself involved. He traverses streets of dirty, straggling\r\nhouses, with now and then an unexpected court, composed of buildings\r\nas ill-proportioned and deformed as the half-naked children that\r\nwallow in the kennels. Here and there, a little dark chandler’s shop,\r\nwith a cracked bell hung up behind the door to announce the entrance\r\nof a customer, or betray the presence of some young gentleman in\r\nwhom a passion for shop tills has developed itself at an early age;\r\nothers, as if for support, against some handsome lofty building, which\r\nusurps the place of a low dingy public-house; long rows of broken\r\nand patched windows expose plants that may have flourished when ‘The\r\nDials’ were built, in vessels as dirty as ‘The Dials’ themselves; and\r\nshops for the purchase of rags, bones, old iron, and kitchen-stuff,\r\nvie in cleanliness with the bird-fanciers and rabbit-dealers, which\r\none might fancy so many arks, but for the irresistible conviction\r\nthat no bird in its proper senses, who was permitted to leave one of\r\nthem would ever come back again. Brokers’ shops, which would seem to\r\nhave been established by humane individuals, as refuges for destitute\r\nbugs, interspersed with announcements of day-schools, penny theatres,\r\npetition-writers, mangles, and music for balls or routs, complete the\r\n‘still-life’ of the subject; and dirty men, filthy women, squalid\r\nchildren, fluttering shuttlecocks, noisy battledores, reeking pipes,\r\nbad fruit, more than doubtful oysters, attenuated cats, depressed dogs,\r\nand anatomical fowls, are its cheerful accompaniments.\r\n\r\n“If the external appearance of the houses, or a glance at their\r\ninhabitants, present but few attractions, a closer acquaintance with\r\neither is little calculated to alter one’s first impression. Every room\r\nhas its separate tenant, and every tenant is, by the same mysterious\r\ndispensation which causes a country curate to ‘increase and multiply’\r\nmost marvellously, generally the head of a numerous family.\r\n\r\n“The man in the shop, perhaps, is in the baked ‘jemmy’ line, or the\r\nfire-wood and hearth-stone line, or any other line which requires a\r\nfloating capital of eighteen pence or thereabouts: and he and his\r\nfamily live in the shop, and the small back parlour behind it. Then\r\nthere is an Irish labourer and _his_ family in the back kitchen, and\r\na jobbing-man--carpet-beater and so forth--with _his_ family, in the\r\nfront one. In the front one pair there’s another man with another wife\r\nand family, and in the back one-pair there’s ‘a young ’oman as takes\r\nin tambour-work, and dresses quite genteel,’ who talks a good deal\r\nabout ‘my friend,’ and can’t ‘abear anything low.’ The second floor\r\nfront, and the rest of the lodgers, are just a second edition of the\r\npeople below, except a shabby-genteel man in the back attic, who has\r\nhis half-pint of coffee every morning from the coffee-shop next door\r\nbut one, which boasts a little front den called a coffee-room, with a\r\nfire-place, over which is an inscription, politely requesting that,\r\n‘to prevent mistakes,’ customers will ‘please to pay on delivery.’ The\r\nshabby-genteel man is an object of some mystery, but as he leads a life\r\nof seclusion, and never was known to buy anything beyond an occasional\r\npen, except half-pints of coffee, penny loaves, and ha’porths of ink,\r\nhis fellow-lodgers very naturally suppose him to be an author; and\r\nrumours are current in the Dials, that he writes poems for Mr. Warren.\r\n\r\n“Now any body who passed through the Dials on a hot summer’s evening,\r\nand saw the different women of the house gossiping on the steps, would\r\nbe apt to think that all was harmony among them, and that a more\r\nprimitive set of people than the native Diallers could not be imagined.\r\nAlas! the man in the shop illtreats his family; the carpet-beater\r\nextends his professional pursuits to his wife; the one-pair front has\r\nan undying feud with the two-pair front, in consequence of the two-pair\r\nfront persisting in dancing over his (the one-pair front’s) head, when\r\nhe and his family have retired for the night; the two-pair back _will_\r\ninterfere with the front kitchen’s children; the Irishman comes home\r\ndrunk every other night, and attacks every body; and the one-pair back\r\nscreams at everything. Animosities spring up between floor and floor;\r\nthe very cellar asserts his equality. Mrs. A. ‘smacks’ Mrs. B.’s child\r\nfor ‘making faces.’ Mrs. B. forthwith throws cold water over Mrs. A.’s\r\nchild for ‘calling names.’ The husbands are embroiled--the quarrel\r\nbecomes general--an assault is the consequence, and a police-officer\r\nthe result.”\r\n\r\nOf Monmouth-street the same author says:--\r\n\r\n“We have always entertained a particular attachment towards\r\nMonmouth-street, as the only true and real emporium for second-hand\r\nwearing apparel. Monmouth-street is venerable from its antiquity,\r\nand respectable from its usefulness. Holywell-street we despise; the\r\nred-headed and red-whiskered Jews who forcibly haul you into their\r\nsqualid houses, and thrust you into a suit of clothes whether you will\r\nor not, we detest.\r\n\r\n“The inhabitants of Monmouth-street are a distinct class; a peaceable\r\nand retiring race, who immure themselves for the most part in deep\r\ncellars, or small back parlours, and who seldom come forth into the\r\nworld, except in the dusk and coolness of evening, when they may\r\nbe seen seated, in chairs on the pavement, smoking their pipes, or\r\nwatching the gambols of their engaging children as they revel in the\r\ngutter, a happy troop of infantine scavengers. Their countenances bear\r\na thoughtful and a dirty cast, certain indications of their love of\r\ntraffic; and their habitations are distinguished by that disregard of\r\noutward appearance, and neglect of personal comfort, so common among\r\npeople who are constantly immersed in profound speculations, and deeply\r\nengaged in sedentary pursuits.\r\n\r\n“Through every alteration and every change Monmouth-street has still\r\nremained the burial-place of the fashions; and such, to judge from all\r\npresent appearances, it will remain until there are no more fashions to\r\nbury.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF PETTICOAT AND ROSEMARY-LANES.\r\n\r\nImmediately connected with the trade of the central mart for old\r\nclothes are the adjoining streets of Petticoat-lane, and those of the\r\nnot very distant Rosemary-lane. In these localities is a second-hand\r\ngarment-seller at almost every step, but the whole stock of these\r\ntraders, decent, frowsy, half-rotten, or smart and good habiliments,\r\nhas first passed through the channel of the Exchange. The men who sell\r\nthese goods have all bought them at the Exchange--the exceptions being\r\ninsignificant--so that this street-sale is but an extension of the\r\ntrade of the central mart, with the addition that the wares have been\r\nmade ready for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE IN PETTICOAT-LANE.]\r\n\r\nA cursory observation might lead an inexperienced person to the\r\nconclusion, that these old clothes traders who are standing by the\r\nbundles of gowns, or lines of coats, hanging from their door-posts,\r\nor in the place from which the window has been removed, or at the\r\nsides of their houses, or piled in the street before them, are\r\ndrowsy people, for they seem to sit among their property, lost in\r\nthought, or caring only for the fumes of a pipe. But let any one\r\nindicate, even by an approving glance, the likelihood of his becoming\r\na customer, and see if there be any lack of diligence in business.\r\nSome, indeed, pertinaciously invite attention to their wares; some\r\n(and often well-dressed women) leave their premises a few yards to\r\naccost a stranger pointing to a “good dress-coat” or “an excellent\r\nfrock” (coat). I am told that this practice is less pursued than it\r\nwas, and it seems that the solicitations are now addressed chiefly\r\nto strangers. These strangers, persons happening to be passing, or\r\nvisitors from curiosity, are at once recognised; for as in all not very\r\nextended localities, where the inhabitants pursue a similar calling,\r\nthey are, as regards their knowledge of one another, as the members\r\nof one family. Thus a stranger is as easily recognised as he would\r\nbe in a little rustic hamlet where a strange face is not seen once a\r\nquarter. Indeed so narrow are some of the streets and alleys in this\r\nquarter, and so little is there of privacy, owing to the removal, in\r\nwarm weather, even of the casements, that the room is commanded in all\r\nits domestic details; and as among these details there is generally a\r\nfurther display of goods similar to the articles outside, the jammed-up\r\nplaces really look like a great family house with merely a sort of\r\nchannel, dignified by the name of a street, between the right and left\r\nsuites of apartments.\r\n\r\nIn one off-street, where on a Sunday there is a considerable demand for\r\nJewish sweet-meats by Christian boys, and a little sly, and perhaps not\r\nvery successful gambling on the part of the ingenuous youth to possess\r\nthemselves of these confectionaries at the easiest rate, there are\r\nsome mounds of builders’ rubbish upon which, if an inquisitive person\r\nascended, he could command the details of the upper rooms, probably the\r\nbed chambers--if in their crowded apartments these traders can find\r\nspaces for beds.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that old clothes are more than the great staple\r\nof the traffic of this district. Wherever persons are assembled there\r\nare certain to be purveyors of provisions and of cool or hot drinks\r\nfor warm or cold weather. The interior of the Old Clothes Exchange\r\nhas its oyster-stall, its fountain of ginger-beer, its coffee-house,\r\nand ale-house, and a troop of peripatetic traders, boys principally,\r\ncarrying trays. Outside the walls of the Exchange this trade is still\r\nthicker. A Jew boy thrusts a tin of highly-glazed cakes and pastry\r\nunder the people’s noses here; and on the other side a basket of\r\noranges regales the same sense by its proximity. At the next step\r\nthe thoroughfare is interrupted by a gaudy-looking ginger-beer,\r\nlemonade, raspberryade, and nectar fountain; “a halfpenny a glass,\r\na halfpenny a glass, sparkling lemonade!” shouts the vendor as you\r\npass. The fountain and the glasses glitter in the sun, the varnish of\r\nthe wood-work shines, the lemonade really does sparkle, and all looks\r\nclean--except the owner. Close by is a brawny young Irishman, his red\r\nbeard unshorn for perhaps ten days, and his neck, where it had been\r\nexposed to the weather, a far deeper red than his beard, and he is\r\ncarrying a small basket of nuts, and selling them as gravely as if they\r\nwere articles suited to his strength. A little lower is the cry, in a\r\nwoman’s voice, “Fish, fried fish! Ha’penny; fish, fried fish!” and so\r\nmonotonously and mechanically is it ejaculated that one might think\r\nthe seller’s life was passed in uttering these few words, even as a\r\nrook’s is in crying “Caw, caw.” Here I saw a poor Irishwoman who had\r\na child on her back buy a piece of this fish (which may be had “hot”\r\nor “cold”), and tear out a piece with her teeth, and this with all the\r\neagerness and relish of appetite or hunger; first eating the brown\r\noutside and then _sucking_ the bone. I never saw fish look firmer or\r\nwhiter. That fried fish is to be procured is manifest to more senses\r\nthan one, for you can hear the sound of its being fried, and smell\r\nthe fumes from the oil. In an open window opposite frizzle on an old\r\ntray, small pieces of thinly-cut meat, with a mixture of onions, kept\r\nhot by being placed over an old pan containing charcoal. In another\r\nroom a mess of batter is smoking over a grate. “Penny a lot, oysters,”\r\nresounds from different parts. Some of the sellers command two\r\nstreets by establishing their stalls or tubs at a corner. Lads pass,\r\ncarrying sweet-stuff on trays. I observed one very dark-eyed Hebrew\r\nboy chewing the hard-bake he vended--if it were not a substitute--with\r\nan expression of great enjoyment. Heaped-up trays of fresh-looking\r\nsponge-cakes are carried in tempting pyramids. Youths have stocks of\r\nlarge hard-looking biscuits, and walk about crying, “Ha’penny biscuits,\r\nha’penny; three a penny, biscuits;” these, with a morsel of cheese,\r\noften supply a dinner or a luncheon. Dates and figs, as dry as they\r\nare cheap, constitute the stock in trade of other street-sellers.\r\n“Coker-nuts” are sold in pieces and entire; the Jew boy, when he\r\ninvites to the purchase of an entire nut, shaking it at the ear of the\r\ncustomer. I was told by a costermonger that these juveniles had a way\r\nof drumming with their fingers on the shell so as to satisfy a “green”\r\ncustomer that the nut offered was a sound one.\r\n\r\nSuch are the summer eatables and drinkables which I have lately seen\r\nvended in the Petticoat-lane district. In winter there are, as long\r\nas daylight lasts--and in no other locality perhaps does it last so\r\nshort a time--other street provisions, and, if possible, greater zeal\r\nin selling them, the hours of business being circumscribed. There is\r\nthen the potato-can and the hot elder-wine apparatus, and smoking pies\r\nand puddings, and roasted apples and chestnuts, and walnuts, and the\r\nseveral fruits which ripen in the autumn--apples, pears, &c.\r\n\r\nHitherto I have spoken only of such eatables and drinkables as are\r\nready for consumption, but to these the trade in the Petticoat-lane\r\ndistrict is by no means confined. There is fresh fish, generally of the\r\ncheaper kinds, and smoked or dried fish (smoked salmon, moreover, is\r\nsold ready cooked), and costermongers’ barrows, with their loads of\r\ngreen vegetables, looking almost out of place amidst the surrounding\r\ndinginess. The cries of “Fine cauliflowers,” “Large penny cabbages,”\r\n“Eight a shilling, mackarel,” “Eels, live eels,” mix strangely with the\r\nhubbub of the busier street.\r\n\r\nOther street-sellers also abound. You meet one man who says\r\nmysteriously, and rather bluntly, “Buy a good knife, governor.” His\r\ntone is remarkable, and if it attract attention, he may hint that he\r\nhas smuggled goods which he _must_ sell anyhow. Such men, I am told,\r\nlook out mostly for seamen, who often resort to Petticoat-lane; for\r\nidle men like sailors on shore, and idle uncultivated men often love\r\nto lounge where there is bustle. Pocket and pen knives and scissors,\r\n“Penny a piece, penny a pair,” rubbed over with oil, both to hide\r\nand prevent rust, are carried on trays, and spread on stalls, some\r\nstalls consisting of merely a tea-chest lid on a stool. Another\r\nman, carrying perhaps a sponge in his hand, and well-dressed, asks\r\nyou, in a subdued voice, if you want a good razor, as if he almost\r\nsuspected that you meditated suicide, and were looking out for the\r\nmeans! This is another ruse to introduce smuggled (or “duffer’s”)\r\ngoods. Account-books are hawked. “Penny-a-quire,” shouts the itinerant\r\nstreet stationer (who, if questioned, always declares he said “Penny\r\nhalf quire”). “Stockings, stockings, two pence a pair.” “Here’s your\r\nchewl-ry; penny, a penny; pick ’em and choose ’em.” [I may remark that\r\noutside the window of one shop, or rather parlour, if there be any such\r\ndistinction here, I saw the handsomest, as far as I am able to judge,\r\nand the best cheap jewellery I ever saw in the streets.] “Pencils, sir,\r\npencils; steel-pens, steel-pens; ha’penny, penny; pencils, steel-pens;\r\nsealing-wax, wax, wax, wax!” shouts one, “Green peas, ha’penny a pint!”\r\ncries another.\r\n\r\nThese things, however, are but the accompaniments of the main traffic.\r\nBut as such things accompany all traffic, not on a small scale, and may\r\nbe found in almost every metropolitan thoroughfare, where the police\r\nare not required, by the householders, to interfere, I will point out,\r\nto show the distinctive character of the street-trade in this part,\r\nwhat is _not_ sold and not encouraged. I saw no old books. There were\r\nno flowers; no music, which indeed could not be heard except at the\r\noutskirts of the din; and no beggars plying their vocation among the\r\ntrading class.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity pertaining alike to this shop and street locality\r\nis, that everything is at the veriest minimum of price; though it may\r\nnot be asked, it will assuredly be taken. The bottle of lemonade which\r\nis elsewhere a penny is here a halfpenny. The tarts, which among the\r\nstreet-sellers about the Royal Exchange are a halfpenny each, are\r\nhere a farthing. When lemons are two a-penny in St. George’s-market,\r\nOxford-street, as the long line of street stalls towards the western\r\nextremity is called--they are three and four a-penny in Petticoat\r\nand Rosemary lanes. Certainly there is a difference in size between\r\nthe dearer and the cheaper tarts and lemons, and perhaps there is a\r\ndifference in quality also, but the rule of a minimized cheapness has\r\nno exceptions in this cheap-trading quarter.\r\n\r\nBut Petticoat-lane is essentially the old clothes district. Embracing\r\nthe streets and alleys adjacent to Petticoat-lane, and including the\r\nrows of old boots and shoes on the ground, there is perhaps between\r\ntwo and three miles of old clothes. Petticoat-lane proper is long and\r\nnarrow, and to look down it is to look down a vista of many coloured\r\ngarments, alike on the sides and on the ground. The effect sometimes\r\nis very striking, from the variety of hues, and the constant flitting,\r\nor gathering, of the crowd into little groups of bargainers. Gowns of\r\nevery shade and every pattern are hanging up, but none, perhaps, look\r\neither bright or white; it is a vista of dinginess, but many coloured\r\ndinginess, as regards female attire. Dress coats, frock coats, great\r\ncoats, livery and game-keepers’ coats, paletots, tunics, trowsers,\r\nknee-breeches, waistcoats, capes, pilot coats, working jackets, plaids,\r\nhats, dressing gowns, shirts, Guernsey frocks, are all displayed. The\r\npredominant colours are black and blue, but there is every colour;\r\nthe light drab of some aristocratic livery; the dull brown-green of\r\nvelveteen; the deep blue of a pilot jacket; the variegated figures of\r\nthe shawl dressing-gown; the glossy black of the restored garments;\r\nthe shine of newly turpentined black satin waistcoats; the scarlet and\r\ngreen of some flaming tartan; these things--mixed with the hues of the\r\nwomen’s garments, spotted and striped--certainly present a scene which\r\ncannot be beheld in any other part of the greatest city of the world,\r\nnor in any other portion of the world itself.\r\n\r\nThe ground has also its array of colours. It is covered with\r\nlines of boots and shoes, their shining black relieved here and\r\nthere by the admixture of females’ boots, with drab, green, plum\r\nor lavender-coloured “legs,” as the upper part of the boot is\r\nalways called in the trade. There is, too, an admixture of men’s\r\n“button-boots” with drab cloth legs; and of a few red, yellow, and\r\nrusset coloured slippers; and of children’s coloured morocco boots and\r\nshoes. Handkerchiefs, sometimes of a gaudy orange pattern, are heaped\r\non a chair. Lace and muslins occupy small stands or are spread on the\r\nground. Black and drab and straw hats are hung up, or piled one upon\r\nanother and kept from falling by means of strings; while, incessantly\r\nthreading their way through all this intricacy, is a mass of people,\r\nsome of whose dresses speak of a recent purchase in the lane.\r\n\r\nI have said little of the shopkeepers of Petticoat-lane, nor is it\r\nrequisite for the full elucidation of my present subject (which\r\nrelates more especially to _street-sale_), that I should treat of them\r\notherwise than as being in a great degree connected with street-trade.\r\nThey stand in the street (in front of their premises), they trade in\r\nthe street, they smoke and read the papers in the street; and indeed\r\nthe greater part of their lives seems passed in the street, for, as I\r\nhave elsewhere remarked, the Saturday’s or Sabbath’s recreation to some\r\nof them, after synagogue hours, seems to be to stand by their doors\r\nlooking about them.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier periods of the day--the Jewish Sabbath excepted, when\r\nthere is no market at all in Petticoat-lane, not even among the Irish\r\nand other old clothes people, or a mere nothing of a market--the\r\ngoods of these shops seem consigned to the care of the wives and\r\nfemale members of the families of the proprietors. The Old Clothes\r\nExchange, like other places known by the name--the Royal Exchange, for\r\nexample--has its daily season of “high change.” This is, in summer,\r\nfrom about half-past two to five, in winter, from two to four o’clock.\r\nAt those hours the crockman, and the bartering costermonger, and the\r\nJew collector, have sought the Exchange with their respective bargains;\r\nand business there, and in the whole district, is at its fullest tide.\r\nBefore this hour the master of the shop or _store_ (the latter may be\r\nthe more appropriate word) is absent buying, collecting, or transacting\r\nany business which requires him to leave home. It is curious to observe\r\nhow, during this absence, the women, but with most wary eyes to the\r\nbusiness, sit in the street carrying on their domestic occupations.\r\nSome, with their young children about them, are shelling peas; some are\r\ntrimming vegetables; some plying their needles; some of the smaller\r\ntraders’ wives, as well as the street-sellers with a “pitch,” are\r\neating dinners out of basins (laid aside when a customer approaches),\r\nand occasionally some may be engaged in what Mrs. Trollope has called\r\n(in noticing a similar procedure in the boxes of an American theatre)\r\n“the most maternal of all offices.” The females I saw thus occupied\r\nwere principally Jewesses, for though those resorting to the Old\r\nClothes Exchange and its concomitant branches may be but one-fourth\r\nJews, more than half of the remainder being Irish people, the\r\nhouseholders or shopkeepers of the locality, when capital is needed,\r\nare generally Israelites.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that, in describing Petticoat-lane, I have\r\ndescribed it as seen on a fine summer’s day, when the business is at\r\nits height. Until an hour or two after midday the district is quiet,\r\nand on very rainy days its aspect is sufficiently lamentable, for then\r\nit appears actually deserted. Perhaps on a winter’s Saturday night--as\r\nthe Jewish Sabbath terminates at sunset--the scene may be the most\r\nstriking of all. The flaring lights from uncovered gas, from fat-fed\r\nlamps, from the paper-shaded candles, and the many ways in which the\r\npoorer street-folk throw some illumination over their goods, produce a\r\nmultiplicity of lights and shadows, which, thrown and blended over the\r\nold clothes hanging up along the line of street, cause them to assume\r\nmysterious forms, and if the wind be high make them, as they are blown\r\nto and fro, look more mysterious still.\r\n\r\nOn one of my visits to Petticoat-lane I saw two foreign Jews--from\r\nSmyrna I was informed. An old street-seller told me he believed it\r\nwas their first visit to the district. But, new as the scene might be\r\nto them, they looked on impassively at all they saw. They wore the\r\nhandsome and peculiar dresses of their country. A glance was cast\r\nafter them by the Petticoat-lane people, but that was all. In the\r\nStrand they would have attracted considerable attention; not a few\r\nheads would have been turned back to gaze after them; but it seems\r\nthat only to those who may possibly be customers is any notice paid in\r\nPetticoat-lane.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSEMARY-LANE.\r\n\r\nRosemary-lane, which has in vain been re-christened Royal Mint-street,\r\nis from half to three-quarters of a mile long--that is, if we include\r\nonly the portion which runs from the junction of Leman and Dock streets\r\n(near the London Docks) to Sparrow-corner, where it abuts on the\r\nMinories. Beyond the Leman-street termination of Rosemary-lane, and\r\nstretching on into Shadwell, are many streets of a similar character as\r\nregards the street and shop supply of articles to the poor; but as the\r\nold clothes trade is only occasionally carried on there, I shall here\r\ndeal with Rosemary-lane proper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VIEW IN ROSEMARY-LANE.]\r\n\r\nThis lane partakes of some of the characteristics of Petticoat-lane,\r\nbut without its so strongly marked peculiarities. Rosemary-lane is\r\nwider and airier, the houses on each side are loftier (in several\r\nparts), and there is an approach to a gin palace, a thing unknown in\r\nPetticoat-lane: there is no room for such a structure there.\r\n\r\nRosemary-lane, like the quarter I have last described, has its\r\noff-streets, into which the traffic stretches. Some of these\r\noff-streets are narrower, dirtier, poorer in all respects than\r\nRosemary-lane itself, which indeed can hardly be stigmatized as very\r\ndirty. These are Glasshouse-street, Russell-court, Hairbrine-court,\r\nParson’s-court, Blue Anchor-yard (one of the poorest places and with\r\na half-built look), Darby-street, Cartwright-street, Peter’s-court,\r\nPrinces-street, Queen-street, and beyond these and in the direction\r\nof the Minories, Rosemary-lane becomes Sharp’s-buildings and\r\nSparrow-corner. There are other small non-thoroughfare courts,\r\nsometimes called blind alleys, to which no name is attached, but which\r\nare very well known to the neighbourhood as Union-court, &c.; but as\r\nthese are not scenes of street-traffic, although they may be the abodes\r\nof street-traffickers, they require no especial notice.\r\n\r\nThe dwellers in the neighbourhood or the off-streets of Rosemary-lane,\r\ndiffer from those of Petticoat-lane by the proximity of the former\r\nplace to the Thames. The lodgings here are occupied by dredgers,\r\nballast-heavers, coal-whippers, watermen, lumpers, and others whose\r\ntrade is connected with the river, as well as the slop-workers and\r\nsweaters working for the Minories. The poverty of these workers compels\r\nthem to lodge wherever the rent of the rooms is the lowest. As a\r\nfew of the wives of the ballast-heavers, &c., are street-sellers in\r\nor about Rosemary-lane, the locality is often sought by them. About\r\nPetticoat-lane the off-streets are mostly occupied by the old clothes\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\nIn Rosemary-lane is a greater _street_-trade, as regards things placed\r\non the ground for retail sale, &c., than in Petticoat-lane; for though\r\nthe traffic in the last-mentioned lane is by far the greatest, it is\r\nmore connected with the shops, and fewer traders whose dealings are\r\nstrictly those of the street alone resort to it. Rosemary-lane, too,\r\nis more Irish. There are some cheap lodging-houses in the courts,\r\n&c., to which the poor Irish flock; and as they are very frequently\r\nstreet-sellers, on busy days the quarter abounds with them. At every\r\nstep you hear the Erse tongue, and meet with the Irish physiognomy;\r\nJews and Jewesses are also seen in the street, and they abound in the\r\nshops. The street-traffic does not begin until about one o’clock,\r\nexcept as regards the vegetable, fish, and oyster-stalls, &c.; but the\r\nchief business of this lane, which is as inappropriately as that of\r\nPetticoat is suitably named, is in the vending of the articles which\r\nhave often been thrown aside as refuse, but from which numbers in\r\nLondon wring an existence.\r\n\r\nOne side of the lane is covered with old boots and shoes; old clothes,\r\nboth men’s, women’s, and children’s; new lace for edgings, and a\r\nvariety of cheap prints and muslins (also new); hats and bonnets; pots,\r\nand often of the commonest kinds; tins; old knives and forks, old\r\nscissors, and old metal articles generally; here and there is a stall\r\nof cheap bread or American cheese, or what is announced as American;\r\nold glass; different descriptions of second-hand furniture of the\r\nsmaller size, such as children’s chairs, bellows, &c. Mixed with these,\r\nbut only very scantily, are a few bright-looking swag-barrows, with\r\nchina ornaments, toys, &c. Some of the wares are spread on the ground\r\non wrappers, or pieces of matting or carpet; and some, as the pots, are\r\noccasionally placed on straw. The cotton prints are often heaped on the\r\nground; where are also ranges or heaps of boots and shoes, and piles of\r\nold clothes, or hats, or umbrellas. Other traders place their goods on\r\nstalls or barrows, or over an old chair or clothes-horse. And amidst\r\nall this motley display the buyers and sellers smoke, and shout, and\r\ndoze, and bargain, and wrangle, and eat and drink tea and coffee, and\r\nsometimes beer. Altogether Rosemary-lane is more of a _street_ market\r\nthan is Petticoat-lane.\r\n\r\nThis district, like the one I have first described, is infested with\r\nyoung thieves and vagrants from the neighbouring lodging-houses,\r\nwho may be seen running about, often bare-footed, bare-necked, and\r\nshirtless, but “larking” one with another, and what may be best\r\nunderstood as “full of fun.” In what way these lads dispose of their\r\nplunder, and how their plunder is in any way connected with the\r\ntrade of these parts, I shall show in my account of the Thieves. One\r\npickpocket told me that there was no person whom he delighted so much\r\nto steal from as any Petticoat-laner with whom he had professional\r\ndealings!\r\n\r\nIn Rosemary-lane there is a busy Sunday morning trade; there is a\r\nstreet-trade, also, on the Saturday afternoons, but the greater part\r\nof the shops are then closed, and the Jews do not participate in the\r\ncommerce until after sunset.\r\n\r\nThe two marts I have thus fully described differ from all other\r\nstreet-markets, for in these two second-hand garments, and second-hand\r\nmerchandize generally (although but in a small proportion), are\r\nthe grand staple of the traffic. At the other street-markets, the\r\nsecond-hand commerce is the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF MEN’S SECOND-HAND CLOTHES.\r\n\r\nIn the following accounts of street-selling, I shall not mix up any\r\naccount of the retailers’ modes of buying, collecting, repairing, or\r\n“restoring” the second-hand garments, otherwise than incidentally. I\r\nhave already sketched the systems pursued, and more will have to be\r\nsaid concerning them under the head of STREET-BUYERS. Neither have\r\nI thought it necessary, in the further accounts I have collected,\r\nto confine myself to the trade carried on in the Petticoat and\r\nRosemary-lane districts. The greater portion relates to those places,\r\nbut my aim, of course, is to give an account which will show the\r\ncharacter of the second-hand trade of the metropolis generally.\r\n\r\n“People should remember,” said an intelligent shoemaker (not a\r\nstreet-seller) with whom I had some conversation about cobbling for\r\nthe streets, “that such places as Rosemary-lane have their uses this\r\nway. But for them a very poor industrious widow, say, with only 2_d._\r\nor 3_d._ to spare, couldn’t get a pair of shoes for her child; whereas\r\nnow, for 2_d._ or 3_d._, she can get them there, of some sort or other.\r\nThere’s a sort of decency, too, in wearing shoes. And what’s more,\r\nsir--for I’ve bought old coats and other clothes in Rosemary-lane, both\r\nfor my own wear and my family’s, and know something about it--how is a\r\npoor creature to get such a decency as a petticoat for a poor little\r\ngirl, if she’d only a penny, unless there were such places?”\r\n\r\nIn the present state of the very poor, it may be that such places as\r\nthose described have, on the principle that half a loaf is better than\r\nno bread, their benefits. But whether the state of things in which an\r\nindustrious widow, or a host of industrious persons, _can_ spare but\r\n1_d._ for a child’s clothing (and nothing, perhaps, for their own), is\r\none to be lauded in a Christian country, is another question, fraught\r\nwith grave political and social considerations.\r\n\r\nThe man from whom I received the following account of the sale of men’s\r\nwearing apparel was apparently between 30 and 40 years of age. His face\r\npresented something of the Jewish physiognomy, but he was a Christian,\r\nhe said, though he never had time to go to church or chapel, and Sunday\r\nwas often a busy day; besides, a man must live as others in his way\r\nlived. He had been connected with the sale of old clothes all his\r\nlife, as were his parents, so that his existence had been monotonous\r\nenough, for he had never been more than five miles, he thought, from\r\nWhitechapel, the neighbourhood where he was born. In winter he liked a\r\nconcert, and was fond of a hand at cribbage, but he didn’t care for the\r\nplay. His goods he sometimes spread on the ground--at other times he\r\nhad a stall or a “horse” (clothes-horse).\r\n\r\n“My customers,” he said, “are nearly all working people, some of them\r\nvery poor, and with large families. For anything I know, some of them\r\nworks with their heads, though, as well, and not their hands, for I’ve\r\nnoticed that their hands is smallish and seems smoothish, and suits a\r\ntight sleeve very well. I don’t know what they are. How should I? I\r\nasks no questions, and they’ll tell me no fibs. To such as them I sell\r\ncoats mostly; indeed, very little else. They’re often very perticler\r\nabout the fit, and often asks, ‘Does it look as if it was made for\r\nme?’ Sometimes they is seedy, very seedy, and comes to such as me,\r\nmost likely, ’cause we’re cheaper than the shops. They don’t like to\r\ntry things on in the street, and I can always take a decent customer,\r\nor one as looks sich, in there, to try on (pointing to a coffee-shop).\r\nBob-tailed coats (dress-coats) is far the cheapest. I’ve sold them\r\nas low as 1_s._, but not often; at 2_s._ and 3_s._ often enough; and\r\nsometimes as high as 5_s._ Perhaps a 3_s._ or 3_s._ 6_d._ coat goes off\r\nas well as any, but bob-tailed coats is little asked for. Now, I’ve\r\nnever had a frock (surtout or frock coat), as well as I can remember,\r\nunder 2_s._ 6_d._, except one that stuck by me a long time, and I sold\r\nit at last for 20_d._, which was 2_d._ less than what it cost. It was\r\nonly a poor thing, in course, but it had such a rum-coloured velvet\r\ncollar, that was faded, and had had a bit let in, and was all sorts\r\nof shades, and that hindered its selling, I fancy. Velvet collars\r\nisn’t worn now, and I’m glad of it. Old coats goes better with their\r\nown collars (collars of the same cloth as the body of the coat). For\r\nfrocks, I’ve got as much as 7_s._ 6_d._, and cheap at it too, sir.\r\nWell, perhaps (laughing) at an odd time they wasn’t so very cheap, but\r\nthat’s all in the way of trade. About 4_s._ 6_d._ or 5_s._ is perhaps\r\nthe ticket that a frock goes off best at. It’s working people that buys\r\nfrocks most, and often working people’s wives or mothers--that is as\r\nfar as I knows. They’re capital judges as to what’ll fit their men;\r\nand if they satisfy me it’s all right, I’m always ready to undertake\r\nto change it for another if it don’t fit. O, no, I never agree to\r\ngive back the money if it don’t fit; in course not; that wouldn’t be\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, we’re very little troubled with people larking. I have had\r\nyoung fellows come, half drunk, even though it might be Sunday morning,\r\nand say, ‘Guv’ner, what’ll you give me to wear that coat for you, and\r\nshow off your cut?’ We don’t stand much of their nonsense. I don’t\r\nknow what such coves are. Perhaps ’torneys’ journeymen, or pot-boys\r\nout for a Sunday morning’s spree.” [This was said with a bitterness\r\nthat surprised me in so quiet-speaking a man.] “In greatcoats and\r\ncloaks I don’t do much, but it’s a very good sale when you can offer\r\nthem well worth the money. I’ve got 10_s._ often for a greatcoat, and\r\nhigher and lower, oftener lower in course; but 10_s._ is about the\r\ncard for a good thing. It’s the like with cloaks. Paletots don’t sell\r\nwell. They’re mostly thinner and poorer cloth to begin with at the\r\ntailors--them new-fashioned named things often is so--and so they show\r\nwhen hard worn. Why no, sir, they can be done up, certainly; anything\r\ncan be touched up; but they get thin, you see, and there’s nothing to\r\nwork upon as there is in a good cloth greatcoat. You’ll excuse me, sir,\r\nbut I saw you a little bit since take one of them there square books\r\nthat a man gives away to people coming this way, as if to knock up the\r\nsecond-hand business, but he won’t, though; I’ll tell you how them\r\nslops, if they come more into wear, is sure to injure us. If people\r\ngets to wear them low-figured things, more and more, as they possibly\r\nmay, why where’s the second-hand things to come from? I’m not a tailor,\r\nbut I understands about clothes, and I believe that no person ever saw\r\nanything green in my eye. And if you find a slop thing marked a guinea,\r\nI don’t care what it is, but I’ll undertake that you shall get one\r\nthat’ll wear longer, and look better to the very last, second-hand, at\r\nless than half the money, plenty less. It was good stuff and good make\r\nat first, and hasn’t been abused, and that’s the reason why it always\r\nbangs a slop, because it was good to begin with.\r\n\r\n“Trousers sells pretty well. I sell them, cloth ones, from 6_d._ up\r\nto 4_s._ They’re cheaper if they’re not cloth, but very seldom less\r\nor so low as 6_d._ Yes, the cloth ones at that is poor worn things,\r\nand little things too. They’re not men’s, they’re youth’s or boy’s\r\nsize. Good strong cords goes off very well at 1_s._ and 1_s._ 6_d._,\r\nor higher. Irish bricklayers buys them, and paviours, and such like.\r\nIt’s easy to fit a man with a pair of second-hand trousers. I can tell\r\nby his build what’ll fit him directly. Tweeds and summer trousers is\r\nmiddling, but washing things sells worse and worse. It’s an expense,\r\nand expenses don’t suit my customers--not a bit of it.\r\n\r\n“Waistcoats isn’t in no great call. They’re often worn very hard under\r\nany sort of a tidy coat, for a tidy coat can be buttoned over anything\r\nthat’s ‘dicky,’ and so, you see, many of ’em’s half-way to the rag-shop\r\nbefore they comes to us. Well, I’m sure I can hardly say what sort of\r\npeople goes most for weskets” [so he pronounced it]. “If they’re light,\r\nor there’s anything ‘fancy’ about them, I thinks it’s mothers as makes\r\nthem up for their sons. What with the strings at the back and such\r\nlike, it aint hard to make a wesket fit. They’re poor people as buys\r\ncertainly, but genteel people buys such things as fancy weskets, or\r\nhow do you suppose they’d all be got through? O, there’s ladies comes\r\nhere for a bargain, I can tell you, and gentlemen, too; and many on ’em\r\nwould go through fire for one. Second-hand satins (waistcoats) is good\r\nstill, but they don’t fetch the tin they did. I’ve sold weskets from\r\n1-1/2_d._ to 4_s._ Well, it’s hard to say what the three-ha’pennies is\r\nmade of; all sorts of things; we calls them ‘serge.’ Three-pence is a\r\ncommon price for a little wesket. There’s no under-weskets wanted now,\r\nand there’s no rolling collars. It was better for us when there was, as\r\nthere was more stuff to work on. The double-breasted gets scarcer, too.\r\nFashions grows to be cheap things now-a-days.\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell you anything about knee-breeches; they don’t come into my\r\ntrade, and they’re never asked for. Gaiters is no go either. Liveries\r\nisn’t a street-trade. I fancy all those sort of things is sent\r\nabroad. I don’t know where. Perhaps where people doesn’t know they was\r\nliveries. I wouldn’t wear an old livery coat, if it was the Queen’s,\r\nfor five bob. I don’t think wearing one would hinder trade. You may\r\nhave seen a black man in a fine livery giving away bills of a slop in\r\nHolborn. If we was to have such a thing we’d be pulled up (apprehended)\r\nfor obstructing.\r\n\r\n“I sells a few children’s (children’s clothes), but only a few, and\r\nI can’t say so much about them. They sells pretty freely though, and\r\nto very decent people. If they’re good, then they’re ready for use.\r\nIf they ain’t anything very prime, they can be mended--that is, if\r\nthey was good to begin with. But children’s woollen togs is mostly\r\nhardworn and fit only for the ‘devil’ (the machine which tears them up\r\nfor shoddy). I’ve sold suits, which was tunics and trousers, but no\r\nweskets, for 3_s._ 6_d._ when they was tidy. That’s a common price.\r\n\r\n“Well, really, I hardly know how much I make every week; far too\r\nlittle, I know that. I could no more tell you how many coats I sell in\r\na year, or how many weskets, than I could tell you how many days was\r\nfine, and how many wasn’t. I can carry all in my head, and so I keeps\r\nno accounts. I know exactly what every single thing I sell has cost me.\r\nIn course I must know _that_. I dare say I may clear about 12_s._ bad\r\nweeks, and 18_s._ good weeks, more and less both ways, and there’s more\r\nbad weeks than good. I have cleared 50_s._ in a good week; and when\r\nit’s been nothing but fog and wet, I haven’t cleared 3_s._ 6_d._ But\r\nmine’s a better business than common, perhaps. I can’t say what others\r\nclears; more and less than I does.”\r\n\r\nThe profit in this trade, from the best information I could obtain,\r\nruns about 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND BOOTS AND SHOES.\r\n\r\nThe man who gave me the following account of this trade had been\r\nfamiliar with it a good many years, fifteen he believed, but was by no\r\nmeans certain. I saw at his lodgings a man who was finishing his day’s\r\nwork there, in cobbling and “translating.” He was not in the employ of\r\nmy informant, who had two rooms, or rather a floor; he slept in one and\r\nlet the other to the “translator” who was a relation, he told me, and\r\nthey went on very well together, as he (the street-seller) liked to sit\r\nand smoke his pipe of a night in the translator’s room, which was much\r\nlarger than his own; and sometimes, when times were “pretty bobbish,”\r\nthey clubbed together for a good supper of tripe, or had a “prime hot\r\nJemmy a-piece,” with a drop of good beer. A “Jemmy” is a baked sheep’s\r\nhead. The room was tidy enough, but had the strong odour of shoemaker’s\r\nwax proper to the craft.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in a good many street-trades, and others too,” said my\r\ninformant, “since you want to know, and for a good purpose as well as\r\nI can understand it. I was a ’prentice to a shoemaker in Northampton,\r\nwith a lot more; why, it was more like a factory than anything else,\r\nwas my master’s, and the place we worked in was so confined and hot,\r\nand we couldn’t open the window, that it was worse than the East\r\nIngees. O, I know what they is. I’ve been there. I was so badly treated\r\nI ran away from my master, for I had only a father, and he cared\r\nnothing about me, and so I broke my indentures. After a good bit of\r\nknocking about and living as I could, and starving when I couldn’t, but\r\nI never thought of going back to Northampton, I ’listed and was a good\r\nbit in the Ingees. Well, never mind, sir, how long, or what happened me\r\nwhen I was soldier. I did nothing wrong, and that ain’t what you was\r\nasking about, and I’d rather say no more about it.”\r\n\r\nI have met with other street-folk, who had been soldiers, and who were\r\nfond of talking of their “service,” often enough to grumble about it,\r\nso that I am almost tempted to think my informant had deserted, but I\r\nquestioned him no further on the subject.\r\n\r\n“I had my ups and downs again, sir,” he continued, “when I got back\r\nto England. God bless us all; I’m very fond of children, but I never\r\nmarried, and when I’ve been at the worst, I’ve been really glad that I\r\nhadn’t no one depending on me. It’s bad enough for oneself, but when\r\nthere’s others as you must love, what must it be then? I’ve smoked a\r\npipe when I was troubled in mind, and couldn’t get a meal, but could\r\nonly get a pipe, and baccy’s shamefully dear here; but if I’d had a\r\nyoung daughter now, what good would it have been my smoking a pipe to\r\ncomfort her? I’ve seen that in people that’s akin to me, and has been\r\nbadly off, and with families. I had a friend or two in London, and\r\nI applied to them when I couldn’t hold out no longer, and they gave\r\nme a bit of a rise, so I began as a costermonger. I was living among\r\nthem as was in that line. Well, now, it’s a pleasant life in fine\r\nweather. Why it was only this morning Joe (the translator) was reading\r\nthe paper at breakfast time;--he gets it from the public-house, and\r\nif it’s two, three, or four days old, it’s just as good for us;--and\r\nthere was 10,000 pines had been received from the West Ingees. There’s\r\na chance for the costermongers, says I, if they don’t go off too dear.\r\nThen cherries is in; and I was beginning to wish I was a costermonger\r\nmyself still, but my present trade is _surer_. My boots and shoes’ll\r\nkeep. They don’t spoil in hot weather. Cherries and strawberries does,\r\nand if it comes thunder and wet, you can’t sell. I worked a barrow, and\r\nsometimes had only a bit of a pitch, for a matter of two year, perhaps,\r\nand then I got into this trade, as I understood it. I sells all sorts,\r\nbut not so much women’s or children’s.\r\n\r\n“Why, as to prices, there’s two sorts of prices. You may sell as you\r\nbuy, or you may sell new soled and heeled. They’re never new welted\r\nfor the streets. It wouldn’t pay a bit. Not long since I had a pair of\r\nvery good Oxonians that had been new welted, and the very first day I\r\nhad them on sale--it was a dull drizzly day--a lad tried to prig them.\r\nI just caught him in time. Did I give him in charge? I hope I’ve more\r\nsense. I’ve been robbed before, and I’ve caught young rips in the act.\r\nIf it’s boots or shoes they’ve tried to prig, I gives them a stirruping\r\nwith whichever it is, and a kick, and lets them go.\r\n\r\n“Men’s shoes, the regular sort, isn’t a very good sale. I get from\r\n10_d._ to 4_s._ 6_d._ a pair; but the high priced ’uns is either soled\r\nand heeled, and mudded well, or they’ve been real well-made things, and\r\nnot much worn. I’ve had gentlemen’s shooting-shoes sometimes, that’s\r\nflung aside for the least thing. The plain shoes don’t go off at all.\r\nI think people likes something to cover their stocking-feet more. For\r\ncloth button-boots I get from 1_s._--that’s the lowest I ever sold\r\nat--to 2_s._ 6_d._ The price is according to what condition the things\r\nis in, and what’s been done to them, but there’s no regular price.\r\nThey’re not such good sale as they would be, because they soon show\r\nworn. The black ‘legs’ gets to look very seamy, and it’s a sort of boot\r\nthat won’t stand much knocking about, if it ain’t right well made at\r\nfirst. I’ve been selling Oxonian button-overs (‘Oxonian’ shoes, which\r\ncover the instep, and are closed by being buttoned instead of being\r\nstringed through four or five holes) at 3_s._ 6_d._ and 4_s._ but they\r\nwas really good, and soled and heeled; others I sell at 1_s._ 6_d._\r\nto 2_s._ 3_d._ or 2_s._ 6_d._ Bluchers is from 1_s._ to 3_s._ 6_d._\r\nWellingtons from 1_s._--yes, indeed, I’ve had them as low as 1_s._, and\r\nperhaps they weren’t very cheap at that, them very low-priced things\r\nnever is, neither new nor old--from 1_s._ to 5_s._; but Wellingtons is\r\nmore for the shops than the street. I do a little in children’s boots\r\nand shoes. I sell them from 3_d._ to 15_d._ Yes, you can buy lower than\r\n3_d._, but I’m not in that way. They sell quite as quick, or quicker,\r\nthan anything. I’ve sold children’s boots to poor women that wanted\r\nshoeing far worse than the child; aye, many a time, sir. Top boots\r\n(they’re called ‘Jockeys’ in the trade) isn’t sold in the streets.\r\nI’ve never had any, and I don’t see them with others in my line. O no,\r\nthere’s no such thing as Hessians or back-straps (a top-boot without\r\nthe light-coloured top) in my trade now. Yes, I always have a seat\r\nhandy where anybody can try on anything in the street; no, sir, no\r\nboot-hooks nor shoe-horn; shoe-horns is rather going out, I think. If\r\nwhat we sell in the streets won’t go on without them they won’t be sold\r\nat all. A good many will buy if the thing’s only big enough--they can’t\r\nbear pinching, and don’t much care for a fine fit.\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose I take from 30_s._ to 40_s._ a week, 14_s._ is about\r\nmy profit--that’s as to the year through.\r\n\r\n“I sell little for women’s wear, though I do sell their boots and shoes\r\nsometimes.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF OLD HATS.\r\n\r\nThe two street-sellers of old coats, waistcoats, and trousers, and of\r\nboots and shoes, whose statements precede this account, confined their\r\ntrade, generally, to the second-hand merchandize I have mentioned as\r\nmore especially constituting their stock. But this arrangement does\r\nnot wholly prevail. There are many street-traders “in second-hand,”\r\nperhaps two-thirds of the whole number, who sell indiscriminately\r\nanything which they can buy, or what they hope to turn out an\r\nadvantage; but even they prefer to deal more in one particular kind of\r\nmerchandize than another, and this is most of all the case as concerns\r\nthe street-sale of old boots and shoes. Hats, however, are among the\r\nsecond-hand wares which the street-seller rarely vends unconnected\r\nwith other stock. I was told that this might be owing to the hats sold\r\nin the streets being usually suitable only for one class, grown men;\r\nwhile clothes and boots and shoes are for boys as well as men. Caps may\r\nsupersede the use of hats, but nothing can supersede the use of boots\r\nor shoes, which form the _steadiest_ second-hand street-trade of any.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, occasions, when a street-seller exerts himself to\r\nbecome possessed of a cheap stock of hats, by the well-known process\r\nof “taking a quantity,” and sells them without, or with but a small\r\nadmixture of other goods. One man who had been lately so occupied, gave\r\nme the following account. He was of Irish parentage, but there was\r\nlittle distinctive in his accent:--\r\n\r\n“Hats,” he said, “are about the awkwardest things of any for the\r\nstreets. Do as you will, they require a deal of room, so that what\r\nyou’ll mostly see isn’t hats quite ready to put on your head and walk\r\naway in, but to be made ready. I’ve sold hats that way though, I mean\r\nready to wear, and my father before me has sold hundreds--yes, I’ve\r\nbeen in the trade all my life--and it’s the best way for a profit. You\r\nget, perhaps, the old hat in, or you buy it at 1_d._ or 2_d._ as may\r\nbe, and so you kill two birds. But there’s very little of that trade\r\nexcept on Saturday nights or Sunday mornings. People wants a decent\r\ntile for Sundays and don’t care for work-days. I never hawks hats,\r\nbut I sells to those as do. My customers for hats are mechanics, with\r\nan odd clerk or two. Yes, indeed, I sell hats now and then to my own\r\ncountrymen to go decent to mass in. I go to mass myself as often as\r\nI can; sometimes I go to vespers. No, the Irish in this trade ain’t\r\nso good in going to chapel as they ought, but it takes such a time;\r\nnot just while you’re there, but in shaving, and washing, and getting\r\nready. My wife helps me in selling second-hand things; she’s a better\r\nhand than I am. I have two boys; they’re young yet, and I don’t know\r\nwhat we shall bring them up to; perhaps to our own business; and\r\nchildren seems to fall naturally into it, I think, when their fathers\r\nand mothers is in it. They’re at school now.\r\n\r\n“I have sold hats from 6_d._ to 3_s._ 6_d._, but very seldom 3_s._\r\n6_d._ The 3_s._ 6_d._ ones would wear out two new gossamers, I know.\r\nIt’s seldom you see beaver hats in the street-trade now, they’re nearly\r\nall silk. They say the beavers have got scarce in foreign parts where\r\nthey’re caught. I haven’t an idea how many hats I sell in a year,\r\nfor I don’t stick to hats, you see, sir, but I like doing in them as\r\nwell or better than in anything else. Sometimes I’ve sold nothing but\r\nhats for weeks together, wholesale and retail that is. It’s only the\r\nregular-shaped hats I can sell. If you offer swells’ hats, people’ll\r\nsay: ‘I may as well buy a new “wide-awake” at once.’ I have made\r\n20_s._ in a week on hats alone. But if I confined my trade to them\r\nnow, I don’t suppose I could clear 5_s._ one week with another the\r\nyear through. It’s only the hawkers that can sell them in wet weather.\r\nI wish we could sell under cover in all the places where there’s what\r\nyou call ‘street-markets.’ It would save poor people that lives by the\r\nstreet many a twopence by their things not being spoiled, and by people\r\nnot heeding the rain to go and examine them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF WOMEN’S SECOND-HAND APPAREL.\r\n\r\nThis trade, as regards the sale to retail customers in the streets,\r\nis almost entirely in the hands of women, seven-eighths of whom\r\nare the wives, relatives, or connections of the men who deal in\r\nsecond-hand male apparel. But gowns, cloaks, bonnets, &c., are\r\ncollected more largely by men than by women, and the wholesale old\r\nclothes’ merchants of course deal in every sort of habiliment.\r\nPetticoat and Rosemary-lanes are the grand marts for this street-sale,\r\nbut in Whitecross-street, Leather-lane, Old-street (St. Luke’s), and\r\nsome similar Saturday-night markets in poor neighbourhoods, women’s\r\nsecond-hand apparel is sometimes offered. “It is often of little use\r\noffering it in the latter places,” I was told by a lace-seller who\r\nhad sometimes tried to do business in second-hand shawls and cloaks,\r\n“because you are sure to hear, ‘Oh, we can get them far cheaper in\r\nPetticoat-lane, when we like to go as far.’”\r\n\r\nThe different portions of female dress are shown and sold in the\r\nstreet, as I have described in my account of Rosemary-lane, and of the\r\ntrading of the men selling second-hand male apparel. There is not so\r\nmuch attention paid to “set off” gowns that there is to set off coats.\r\n“If the gown be a washing gown,” I was informed, “it is sure to have\r\nto be washed before it can be worn, and so it is no use bothering with\r\nit, and paying for soap and labour beforehand. If it be woollen, or\r\nsome stuff that wont wash, it has almost always to be altered before it\r\nis worn, and so it is no use doing it up perhaps to be altered again.”\r\nSilk goods, however, are carefully enough re-glossed and repaired. Most\r\nof the others “just take their chance.”\r\n\r\nA good-looking Irishwoman gave me the following account. She had come\r\nto London and had been a few years in service, where she saved a little\r\nmoney, when she married a cousin, but in what degree of cousinship she\r\ndid not know. She then took part in his avocation as a crockman, and\r\nsubsequently as a street-seller of second-hand clothes.\r\n\r\n“Why, yis, thin and indeed, sir,” she said, “I did feel rather quare\r\nin my new trade, going about from house to house, the Commercial-road\r\nand Stepney way, but I soon got not to mind, and indeed thin it don’t\r\nmatter much what way one gets one’s living, so long as it’s honest. O,\r\nyis, I know there’s goings on in old clothes that isn’t always honest,\r\nbut my husband’s a fair dealing man. I felt quarer, too, whin I had\r\nto sell in the strate, but I soon got used to that, too; and it’s not\r\nsuch slavish work as the ‘crocks.’ But we sometimes ‘crocks’ in the\r\nmornings a little still, and sells in the evenings. No, not what we’ve\r\ncollected--for that goes to Mr. Isaac’s market almost always--but stock\r\nthat’s ready for wear.\r\n\r\n“For _Cotton Gowns_ I’ve got from 9_d._ to 2_s._ 3_d._ O, yis, and\r\nindeed thin, there’s gowns chaper, 4_d._ and 6_d._, but there’s nothing\r\nto be got out of them, and we don’t sell them. From 9_d._ to 18_d._\r\nis the commonest price. It’s poor people as buys: O, yis, and indeed\r\nthin it is, thim as has families, and must look about thim. Many’s the\r\npoor woman that’s said to me, ‘Well, and indeed, marm, it isn’t my\r\ninclination to chapen anybody as I thinks is fair, and I was brought up\r\nquite different to buying old gowns, I assure you’--yis, that’s often\r\nsaid; no, sir, it isn’t my countrywomen that says it (laughing), it’s\r\nyours. ‘I wouldn’t think,’ says she, ‘of offering you 1_d._ less than\r\n1_s._, marm, for that frock for my daughter, marm, but it’s such a hard\r\nfight to live.’ Och, thin, and it is indeed; but to hear some of them\r\ntalk you’d think they was born ladies. _Stuff-gowns_ is from 2_d._ to\r\n8_d._ higher than cotton, but they don’t sell near so well. I hardly\r\nknow why. Cotton washes, and if a dacent woman gets a chape second-hand\r\ncotton, she washes and does it up, and it seems to come to her fresh\r\nand new. That can’t be done with stuff. _Silk_ is very little in my\r\nway, but silk gowns sell from 3_s._ 6_d._ to 4_s._ Of satin and velvet\r\ngowns I can tell you nothing; they’re never in the streets.\r\n\r\n“_Second-hand Bonnets_ is a very poor sale--very. The milliners, poor\r\ncraitchers, as makes them up and sells them in the strate, has the\r\ngreatest sale, but they makes very little by it. Their bonnets looks\r\nnew, you see, sir, and close and nice for poor women. I’ve sold bonnets\r\nfrom 6_d._ to 3_s._ 6_d._, and some of them cost 3_l._ But whin they\r\ngit faded and out of fashion, they’re of no vally at all at all.\r\n_Shawls_ is a very little sale; very little. I’ve got from 6_d._ to\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ for them. Plaid shawls is as good as any, at about 1_s._\r\n6_d._; but they’re a winter trade. _Cloaks_ (they are what in the\r\ndress-making trade are called mantles) isn’t much of a call. I’ve had\r\nthem from 1_s._ 6_d._ as high as 7_s._--but only once 7_s._, and it was\r\ngood silk. They’re not a sort of wear that suits poor people. Will and\r\nindeed thin, I hardly know who buys them second-hand. Perhaps bad women\r\nbuys a few, or they get men to buy them for them. I think your misses\r\ndon’t buy much second-hand thin in gineral; the less the better, the\r\nlikes of them; yis, indeed, sir. _Stays_ I don’t sell, but you can buy\r\nthem from 3_d._ to 15_d._; it’s a small trade. And I don’t sell _Under\r\nClothing_, or only now and thin, except _Children’s_. Dear me, I can\r\nhardly tell the prices I get for the poor little things’ dress--I’ve a\r\nlittle girl myself--the prices vary so, just as the frocks and other\r\nthings is made for big children or little, and what they’re made of.\r\nI’ve sold frocks--they sell best on Saturday and Monday nights--from\r\n2_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ Little petticoats is 1_d._ to 3_d._; shifts is\r\n1_d._ and 2_d._, and so is little shirts. If they wasn’t so low there\r\nwould be more rags than there is, and sure there’s plinty.\r\n\r\n“Will, thin and indeed, I don’t know what we make in a week, and if I\r\ndid, why should I tell? O, yes, sir, I know from the gentleman that\r\nsent you to me that you’re asking for a good purpose: yis, indeed,\r\nthin; but I ralely can’t say. We do pritty well, God’s name be praised!\r\nPerhaps a good second-hand gown trade and such like is worth from\r\n10_s._ to 15_s._ a week, and nearer 15_s._ than 10_s._ ivery week; but\r\nthat’s a _good_ second-hand trade you understand, sir. A poor trade’s\r\nabout half that, perhaps. But thin my husband sells men’s wear as well.\r\nYis, indeed, and I find time to go to mass, and I soon got my husband\r\nto go after we was married, for he’d got to neglect it, God be praised;\r\nand what’s all you can get here compared to making your sowl” [saving\r\nyour soul--_making_ your soul is not an uncommon phrase among some of\r\nthe Irish people]. “Och, and indeed thin, sir, if you’ve met Father\r\n----, you’ve met a good gintleman.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the street-selling of _women and children’s second-hand boots and\r\nshoes_, I need say but little, as they form part of the stock of the\r\nmen’s ware, and are sold by the same men, not unfrequently assisted by\r\ntheir wives. The best sale is for black _cloth boots_, whether laced\r\nor buttoned, but the prices run only from 5_d._ to 1_s._ 9_d._ If the\r\n“legs” of a second-hand pair be good, they are worth 5_d._, no matter\r\nwhat the leather portion, including the soles, may be. Coloured boots\r\nsell very indifferently. Children’s boots and shoes are sold from 2_d._\r\nto 15_d._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND FURS.\r\n\r\nOf furs the street-sale is prompt enough, or used to be prompt; but\r\nnot so much so, I am told, last season, as formerly. A fur tippet\r\nis readily bought for the sake of warmth by women who thrive pretty\r\nwell in the keeping of coffee-stalls, or any calling which requires\r\nattendance during the night, or in the chilliness of early morning,\r\neven in summer, by those who go out at early hours to their work. By\r\nsuch persons a big tippet is readily bought when the money is not an\r\nimpediment, and to many it is a strong recommendation, that when new,\r\nthe tippet, most likely, was worn by a real lady. So I was assured by a\r\nperson familiar with the trade.\r\n\r\nOne female street-seller had three stalls or stands in the New Cut\r\n(when it was a great street market), about two years back, and all for\r\nthe sale of second-hand furs. She has now a small shop in second-hand\r\nwearing apparel (women’s) generally, furs being of course included.\r\nThe business carried on in the street (almost always “the Cut”) by\r\nthe fur-seller in question, who was both industrious and respectable,\r\nwas very considerable. On a Monday she has not unfrequently taken\r\n3_l._, one-half of which, indeed more than half, was profit, for the\r\nstreet-seller bought in the summer, when furs “were no money at all,”\r\nand sold in the winter, when they “were really tin, and no mistake.”\r\nBefore the season began, she sometimes had a small room nearly full of\r\nfurs.\r\n\r\nThis trade is less confined to Petticoat-lane and the old clothes\r\ndistrict, as regards the supply to retail customers, than is anything\r\nelse connected with dress. But the fur trade is now small. The money,\r\nprudence, and forethought necessary to enable a fur-seller to buy in\r\nthe summer, for ample profit in the winter, as regards street-trade, is\r\nnot in accordance with the habits of the general run of street-sellers,\r\nwho think but of the present, or hardly think even of that.\r\n\r\nThe old furs, like all the other old articles of wearing apparel,\r\nwhether garbs of what may be accounted primary necessaries, as shoes,\r\nor mere comforts or adornments, as boas or muffs, are bought in the\r\nfirst instance at the Old Clothes Exchange, and so find their way to\r\nthe street-sellers. The exceptions as to this first transaction in the\r\ntrade I now speak of, are very trifling, and, perhaps, more trifling\r\nthan in other articles, for one great supply of furs, I am informed, is\r\nfrom their being swopped in the spring and summer for flowers with the\r\n“root-sellers,” who carry them to the Exchange.\r\n\r\nLast winter there were sometimes as many as ten persons--three-fourths\r\nof the number of second-hand fur sellers, which fluctuates, being\r\nwomen--with fur-stands. They frequent the street-markets on the\r\nSaturday and Monday nights, not confining themselves to any one market\r\nin particular. The best sale is for _Fur Tippets_, and chiefly of the\r\ndarker colours. These are bought, one of the dealers informed me,\r\nfrequently by maid-servants, who could run of errands in them in the\r\ndark, or wear them in wet weather. They are sold from 1_s._ 6_d._\r\nto 4_s._ 6_d._, about 2_s._ or 2_s._ 6_d._ being a common charge.\r\nChildren’s tippets “go off well,” from 6_d._ to 1_s._ 3_d._ _Boas_\r\nare not vended to half the extent of tippets, although they are\r\nlower-priced, one of tolerably good gray squirrel being 1_s._ 6_d._\r\nThe reason of the difference in the demand is that boas are as much\r\nan ornament as a garment, while the tippet answers the purpose of a\r\nshawl. _Muffs_ are not at all vendible in the streets, the few that are\r\ndisposed of being principally for children. As muffs are not generally\r\nused by maid-servants, or by the families of the working classes, the\r\nabsence of demand in the second-hand traffic is easily accounted for.\r\nThey are bought sometimes to cut up for other purposes. _Victorines_\r\nare disposed of readily enough at from 1_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._, as are\r\n_Cuffs_, from 4_d._ to 8_d._\r\n\r\nOne man, who told me that a few years since he and his wife used to\r\nsell second-hand furs in the street, was of opinion that his best\r\ncustomers were women of the town, who were tolerably well-dressed,\r\nand who required some further protection from the night air. He could\r\nreadily sell any “tidy” article, tippet, boa, or muff, to those\r\nfemales, if they had from 2_s._ 6_d._ to 5_s._ at command. He had so\r\nsold them in Clare-market, in Tottenham-court-road, and the Brill.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SECOND-HAND SELLERS OF SMITHFIELD-MARKET.\r\n\r\nNo small part of the second-hand trade of London is carried on in\r\nthe market-place of Smithfield, on the Friday afternoons. Here is\r\na mart for almost everything which is required for the harnessing\r\nof beasts of draught, or is required for any means of propulsion or\r\nlocomotion, either as a whole vehicle, or in its several parts, needed\r\nby street-traders: also of the machines, vessels, scales, weights,\r\nmeasures, baskets, stands, and all other appliances of street-trade.\r\n\r\nThe scene is animated and peculiar. Apart from the horse, ass, and\r\ngoat trade (of which I shall give an account hereafter), it is a grand\r\nSecond-hand Costermongers’ Exchange. The trade is not confined to that\r\nlarge body, though they are the principal merchants, but includes\r\ngreengrocers (often the costermonger in a shop), carmen, and others. It\r\nis, moreover, a favourite resort of the purveyors of street-provisions\r\nand beverages, of street dainties and luxuries. Of this class some of\r\nthe most prosperous are those who are “well known in Smithfield.”\r\n\r\nThe space devoted to this second-hand commerce and its accompaniments,\r\nruns from St. Bartholomew’s Hospital towards Long-lane, but\r\nisolated peripatetic traders are found in all parts of the space\r\nnot devoted to the exhibition of cattle or of horses. The crowd on\r\nthe day of my visit was considerable, but from several I heard the\r\nnot-always-very-veracious remarks of “Nothing doing” and “There’s\r\nnobody at all here to-day.” The weather was sultry, and at every few\r\nyards arose the cry from men and boys, “Ginger-beer, ha’penny a glass!\r\nHa’penny a glass,” or “Iced lemonade here! Iced raspberriade, as cold\r\nas ice, ha’penny a glass, only a ha’penny!” A boy was elevated on a\r\nboard at the end of a splendid affair of this kind. It was a square\r\nbuilt vehicle, the top being about 7 feet by 4, and flat and surmounted\r\nby the lemonade fountain; long, narrow, champagne glasses, holding a\r\nraspberry coloured liquid, frothed up exceedingly, were ranged round,\r\nand the beverage dispensed by a woman, the mother or employer of the\r\nboy who was bawling. The sides of the machine, which stood on wheels,\r\nwere a bright, shiny blue, and on them sprawled the lion and unicorn in\r\ngorgeous heraldry, yellow and gold, the artist being, according to a\r\nprominent announcement, a “herald painter.” The apparatus was handsome,\r\nbut with that exaggeration of handsomeness which attracts the high\r\nand low vulgar, who cannot distinguish between gaudiness and beauty.\r\nThe sale was brisk. The ginger-beer sold in the market was generally\r\ndispensed from carts, and here I noticed, what occurs yearly in\r\nstreet-commerce, an innovation on the established system of the trade.\r\nSeveral sellers disposed of their ginger-beer in clear glass bottles,\r\nsomewhat larger and fuller-necked than those introduced by M. Soyer for\r\nthe sale of his “nectar,” and the liquid was drank out of the bottle\r\nthe moment the cork was undrawn, and so the necessity of a glass was\r\nobviated.\r\n\r\nNear the herald-painter’s work, of which I have just spoken, stood\r\na very humble stall on which were loaves of bread, and round the\r\nloaves were pieces of fried fish and slices of bread on plates, all\r\nremarkably clean. “Oysters! Penny-a lot! Penny-a-lot, oysters!” was\r\nthe cry, the most frequently heard after that of ginger-beer, &c.\r\n“Cherries! Twopence a-pound! Penny-a pound, cherries!” “Fruit-pies!\r\nTry my fruit-pies!” The most famous dealer in all kinds of penny pies\r\nis, however, not a pedestrian, but an equestrian hawker. He drives a\r\nvery smart, handsome pie-cart, sitting behind after the manner of the\r\nHansom cabmen, the lifting up of a lid below his knees displaying his\r\nlarge stock of pies. His “drag” is whisked along rapidly by a brisk\r\nchestnut poney, well-harnessed. The “whole set out,” I was informed,\r\nponey included, cost 50_l._ when new. The proprietor is a keen Chartist\r\nand teetotaller, and loses no opportunity to inculcate to his customers\r\nthe excellence of teetotalism, as well as of his pies. “Milk! ha’penny\r\na pint! ha’penny a pint, good milk!” is another cry. “Raspberry cream!\r\nIced raspberry-cream, ha’penny a glass!” This street-seller had a\r\ncapital trade. Street-ices, or rather ice-creams, were somewhat of a\r\nfailure last year, more especially in Greenwich-park, but this year\r\nthey seem likely to succeed. The Smithfield man sold them in very\r\nsmall glasses, which he merely dipped into a vessel at his feet, and\r\nso filled them with the cream. The consumers had to use their fingers\r\ninstead of a spoon, and no few seemed puzzled how to eat their ice, and\r\nwere grievously troubled by its getting among their teeth. I heard one\r\ndrover mutter that he felt “as if it had snowed in his belly!” Perhaps\r\nat Smithfield-market on the Friday afternoons every street-trade in\r\neatables and drinkables has its representative, with the exception\r\nof such things as sweet-stuff, curds and whey, &c., which are bought\r\nchiefly by women and children. There were plum-dough, plum-cake,\r\npastry, pea-soup, whelks, periwinkles, ham-sandwiches, hot-eels,\r\noranges, &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThese things are the usual accompaniment of street-markets, and I\r\nnow come to the subject matter of the work, the sale of second-hand\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nIn this trade, since the introduction of a new arrangement two months\r\nago, there has been a great change. The vendors are not allowed to vend\r\nbarrows in the market, unless indeed with a poney or donkey harnessed\r\nto them, or unless they are wheeled about by the owner, and they are\r\nnot allowed to spread their wares on the ground. When it is considered\r\nof what those wares are composed, the awkwardness of the arrangement,\r\nto the sales-people, may be understood. They consist of second-hand\r\ncollars, pads, saddles, bridles, bits, traces, every description of\r\nworn harness, whole or in parts; the wheels, springs, axles, &c., of\r\nbarrows and carts; the beams, chains, and bodies of scales;--these,\r\nperhaps, are the chief things which are sold separately, as parts of a\r\nwhole. The traders have now no other option but to carry them as they\r\nbest can, and offer them for sale. You saw men who really appear clad\r\nin harness. Portions were fastened round their bodies, collars slung\r\non their arms, pads or small cart-saddles, with their shaft-gear, were\r\nplanted on their shoulders. Some carried merely a collar, or a harness\r\nbridle, or even a bit or a pair of spurs. It was the same with the\r\nsprings, &c., of the barrows and small carts. They were carried under\r\nmen’s arms, or poised on their shoulders. The wheels and other things\r\nwhich are too heavy for such modes of transport had to be placed in\r\nsome sort of vehicle, and in the vehicles might be seen trestles, &c.\r\n\r\nThe complaints on the part of the second-hand sellers were neither few\r\nnor mild: “If it had been a fat ox that had to be accommodated,” said\r\none, “before he was roasted for an alderman, they’d have found some way\r\nto do it. But it don’t matter for poor men; though why we shouldn’t be\r\nsuited with a market as well as richer people is not the ticket, that’s\r\nthe fact.”\r\n\r\nThese arrangements are already beginning to be infringed, and will be\r\nmore and more infringed, for such is always the case. The reason why\r\nthey were adopted was that the ground was so littered, that there was\r\nnot room for the donkey traffic and other requirements of the market.\r\nThe donkeys, when “shown,” under the old arrangement, often trod on\r\nboards of old metal, &c., spread on the ground, and tripped, sometimes\r\nto their injury, in consequence. Prior to the change, about twenty\r\npersons used to come from Petticoat-lane, &c., and spread their old\r\nmetal or other stores on the ground.\r\n\r\nOf these there are now none. These Petticoat-laners, I was told by a\r\nSmithfield frequenter, were men “who knew the price of old rags,”--a\r\nnew phrase expressive of their knowingness and keenness in trade.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of this trade will be found under that head; the prices\r\nare often much higher and much lower. I speak of the regular trades.\r\nI have not included the sale of the superior butchers’ carts, &c.,\r\nas that is a traffic not in the hands of the regular second-hand\r\nstreet-sellers. I have not thought it requisite to speak of the hawking\r\nof whips, sticks, wash-leathers, brushes, curry-combs, &c., &c., of\r\nwhich I have already treated distinctively.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the Capital and Income of the Street-Sellers of\r\nSecond-Hand Articles I am obliged to defer till a future occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF LIVE ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe live animals sold in the streets include beasts, birds, fish, and\r\nreptiles, all sold in the streets of London.\r\n\r\nThe class of men carrying on this business--for they are nearly all\r\nmen--is mixed; but the majority are of a half-sporting and half-vagrant\r\nkind. One informant told me that the bird-catchers, for instance, when\r\nyoung, as more than three-fourths of them are, were those who “liked\r\nto be after a loose end,” first catching their birds, as a sort of\r\nsporting business, and then sometimes selling them in the streets, but\r\nfar more frequently disposing of them in the bird-shops. “Some of these\r\nboys,” a bird-seller in a large way of business said to me, “used to\r\nbecome rat-catchers or dog-sellers, but there’s not such great openings\r\nin the rat and dog line now. As far as I know, they’re the same lads,\r\nor just the same sort of lads, anyhow, as you may see ‘helping,’\r\nholding horses, or things like that, at concerns like them small races\r\nat Peckham or Chalk Farm, or helping any way at the foot-races at\r\nCamberwell.” There is in this bird-catching a strong manifestation\r\nof the vagrant spirit. To rise long before daybreak; to walk some\r\nmiles before daybreak; from the earliest dawn to wait in some field,\r\nor common, or wood, watching the capture of the birds; then a long\r\ntrudge to town to dispose of the fluttering captives; all this is done\r\ncheerfully, because there are about it the irresistible charms, to this\r\nclass, of excitement, variety, and free and open-air life. Nor do these\r\ncharms appear one whit weakened when, as happens often enough, all this\r\nearly morn business is carried on fasting.\r\n\r\nThe old men in the bird-catching business are not to be ranked as\r\nto their enjoyment of it with the juveniles, for these old men are\r\nsometimes infirm, and can but, as one of them said to me some time ago,\r\n“hobble about it.” But they have the same spirit, or the sparks of it.\r\nAnd in this part of the trade is one of the curious characteristics of\r\na street-life, or rather of an open-air pursuit for the requirements\r\nof a street-trade. A man, worn out for other purposes, incapable of\r\nanything but a passive, or sort of lazy labour--such as lying in a\r\nfield and watching the action of his trap-cages--will yet in a summer’s\r\nmorning, decrepid as he may be, possess himself of a dozen or even a\r\nscore of the very freest and most aspiring of all our English small\r\nbirds, a creature of the air beyond other birds of his “order”--to use\r\nan ornithological term--of sky-larks.\r\n\r\nThe dog-sellers are of a sporting, trading, idling class. Their sport\r\nis now the rat-hunt, or the ferret-match, or the dog-fight; as it was\r\nwith the predecessors of their stamp, the cock-fight; the bull, bear,\r\nand badger bait; the shrove-tide cock-shy, or the duck hunt. Their\r\ntrading spirit is akin to that of the higher-class sporting fraternity,\r\nthe trading members of the turf. They love to sell and to bargain,\r\nalways with a quiet exultation at the time--a matter of loud tavern\r\nboast afterwards, perhaps, as respects the street-folk--how they “do”\r\na customer, or “do” one another. “It’s not cheating,” was the remark\r\nand apology of a very famous jockey of the old times, touching such\r\nmeasures; “it’s not cheating, it’s outwitting.” Perhaps this expresses\r\nthe code of honesty of such traders; not to cheat, but to outwit or\r\nover-reach. Mixed with such traders, however, are found a few quiet,\r\nplodding, fair-dealing men, whom it is difficult to classify, otherwise\r\nthan that they are “in the line, just because they likes it.” The\r\nidling of these street-sellers is a part of their business. To walk\r\nby the hour up and down a street, and with no manual labour except to\r\nclean their dogs’ kennels, and to carry them in their arms, is but an\r\nidleness, although, as some of these men will tell you, “they work hard\r\nat it.”\r\n\r\nUnder the respective heads of dog and bird-sellers, I shall give more\r\ndetailed characteristics of the class, as well as of the varying\r\nqualities and inducements of the buyers.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of foreign birds, such as parrots, parroquets, and\r\ncockatoos; of gold and silver fish; of goats, tortoises, rabbits,\r\nleverets, hedgehogs; and the collectors of snails, worms, frogs, and\r\ntoads, are also a mixed body. Foreigners, Jews, seamen, countrymen,\r\ncostermongers, and boys form a part, and of them I shall give a\r\ndescription under the several heads. The prominently-characterized\r\nstreet-sellers are the traders in dogs and birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE FORMER STREET-SELLERS, “FINDERS,” STEALERS, AND RESTORERS OF\r\nDOGS.\r\n\r\nBefore I describe the present condition of the street-trade in dogs,\r\nwhich is principally in spaniels, or in the description well known as\r\nlap-dogs, I will give an account of the former condition of the trade,\r\nif trade it can properly be called, for the “finders” and “stealers” of\r\ndogs were the more especial subjects of a parliamentary inquiry, from\r\nwhich I derive the official information on the matter. The Report of\r\nthe Committee was ordered by the House of Commons to be printed, July\r\n26, 1844.\r\n\r\nIn their Report the Committee observe, concerning the value of pet\r\ndogs:--“From the evidence of various witnesses it appears, that in one\r\ncase a spaniel was sold for 105_l._, and in another, under a sheriff’s\r\nexecution, for 95_l._ at the hammer; and 50_l._ or 60_l._ are not\r\nunfrequently given for fancy dogs of first-rate breed and beauty.”\r\nThe hundred guineas’ dog above alluded to was a “black and tan King\r\nCharles’s spaniel;”--indeed, Mr. Dowling, the editor of _Bell’s Life\r\nin London_, said, in his evidence before the Committee, “I have known\r\nas much as 150_l._ given for a dog.” He said afterwards: “There are\r\ncertain marks about the eyes and otherwise, which are considered\r\n‘properties;’ and it depends entirely upon the property which a dog\r\npossesses as to its value.”\r\n\r\nI need not dwell on the general fondness of the English for dogs,\r\notherwise than as regards what were the grand objects of the\r\ndog-finders’ search--ladies’ small spaniels and lap-dogs, or, as they\r\nare sometimes called, “carriage-dogs,” by their being the companions of\r\nladies inside their carriages. These animals first became fashionable\r\nby the fondness of Charles II. for them. That monarch allowed them\r\nundisturbed possession of the gilded chairs in his palace of Whitehall,\r\nand seldom took his accustomed walk in the park without a tribe of\r\nthem at his heels. So “fashionable” were spaniels at that time and\r\nafterwards, that in 1712 Pope made the chief of all his sylphs and\r\nsylphides the guard of a lady’s lapdog. The fashion has long continued,\r\nand still continues; and it was on this fashionable fondness for a\r\ntoy, and on the regard of many others for the noble and affectionate\r\nqualities of the dog, that a traffic was established in London, which\r\nbecame so extensive and so lucrative, that the legislature interfered,\r\nin 1844, for the purpose of checking it.\r\n\r\nI cannot better show the extent and lucrativeness of this trade,\r\nthan by citing a list which one of the witnesses before Parliament,\r\nMr. W. Bishop, a gunmaker, delivered in to the Committee, of “cases\r\nin which money had recently been extorted from the owners of dogs\r\nby dog-stealers and their confederates.” There is no explanation of\r\nthe space of time included under the vague term “recently;” but the\r\nreturn shows that 151 ladies and gentlemen had been the victims of\r\nthe dog-stealers or dog-finders, for in this business the words were,\r\nand still are to a degree, synonymes, and of these 62 had been so\r\nvictimized in 1843 and in the six months of 1844, from January to\r\nJuly. The total amount shown by Mr. Bishop to have been paid for the\r\nrestoration of stolen dogs was 977_l._ 4_s._ 6_d._, or an average of\r\n6_l._ 10_s._ per individual practised upon. This large sum, it is\r\nstated on the authority of the Committee, was only that which came\r\nwithin Mr. Bishop’s knowledge, and formed, perhaps, “but a _tenth_\r\npart in amount” of the whole extortion. Mr. Bishop was himself in the\r\nhabit of doing business “in obtaining the restitution of dogs,” and\r\nhad once known 18_l._--the dog-stealers asked 25_l._--given for the\r\nrestitution of a spaniel. The full amount realized by this dog-stealing\r\nwas, according to the above proportion, 9772_l._ 5_s._ In 1843, 227_l._\r\n3_s._ 6_d._ was so realized, and 97_l._ 14_s._ 6_d._ in the six months\r\nof 1844, within Mr. Bishop’s personal knowledge; and if this be\r\nlikewise a _tenth_ of the whole of the commerce in this line, a year’s\r\nbusiness, it appears, averaged 2166_l._ to the stealers or finders\r\nof dogs. I select a few names from the list of those robbed of dogs,\r\neither from the amount paid, or because the names are well known. The\r\nfirst payment cited is from a public board, who owned a dog in their\r\ncorporate capacity:\r\n\r\n                                              £   _s._ _d._\r\n  Board of Green Cloth                        8    0    0\r\n  Hon.

Prior to the parliamentary inquiry,\r\ndog-stealing was not an indictable offence. To show this, Mr.\r\nCommissioner Mayne quoted Blackstone to the Committee: “As to those\r\nanimals which do not serve for food, and which therefore the law holds\r\nto have no intrinsic value, as dogs of all sorts, and other creatures\r\nkept for whim and pleasure--though a man may have a base property\r\ntherein, and maintain a civil action for the loss of them, yet they\r\nare not of such estimation as that the crime of stealing them amounts\r\nto larceny.” The only mode of punishment for dog-stealing was by\r\nsummary conviction, the penalty being fine or imprisonment; but Mr.\r\nCommissioner Mayne did not know of any instance of a dog-stealer being\r\nsent to prison in default of payment. Although the law recognised\r\nno property in a dog, the animal was taxed; and it was complained\r\nat the time that an unhappy lady might have to pay tax for the full\r\nterm upon her dog, perhaps a year and a half after he had been stolen\r\nfrom her. One old offender, who stole the Duke of Beaufort’s dog, was\r\ntransported, not for stealing the dog, but his collar.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of proving the positive theft of a dog was extreme. In\r\nmost cases, where the man was not seen actually to seize a dog which\r\ncould be identified, he escaped when carried before a magistrate. “The\r\ndog-stealers,” said Inspector Shackell, “generally go two together;\r\nthey have a piece of liver; they say it is merely bullock’s liver,\r\nwhich will entice or tame the wildest or savagest dog which there\r\ncan be in any yard; they give it him, and take him from his chain.\r\nAt other times,” continues Mr. Shackell, “they will go in the street\r\nwith a little dog, rubbed over with some sort of stuff, and will\r\nentice valuable dogs away.... If there is a dog lost or stolen, it is\r\ngenerally known within five or six hours where that dog is, and they\r\nknow almost exactly what they can get for it, so that it is a regular\r\nsystem of plunder.” Mr. G. White, “dealer in live stock, dogs, and\r\nother animals,” and at one time a “dealer in lions, and tigers, and all\r\nsorts of things,” said of the dog-stealers: “In turning the corners of\r\nstreets there are two or three of them together; one will snatch up a\r\ndog and put into his apron, and the others will stop the lady and say,\r\n‘What is the matter?’ and direct the party who has lost the dog in a\r\ncontrary direction to that taken.”\r\n\r\nIn this business were engaged from 50 to 60 men, half of them actual\r\nstealers of the animals. The others were the receivers, and the\r\ngo-betweens or “restorers.” The thief kept the dog perhaps for a day\r\nor two at some public-house, and he then took it to a dog-dealer with\r\nwhom he was connected in the way of business. These dealers carried on\r\na trade in “honest dogs,” as one of the witnesses styled them (meaning\r\ndogs honestly acquired), but some of them dealt principally with the\r\ndog-stealers. Their depots could not be entered by the police, being\r\nprivate premises, without a search-warrant--and direct evidence was\r\nnecessary to obtain a search-warrant--and of course a stranger in quest\r\nof a stolen dog would not be admitted. Some of the dog-dealers would\r\nnot purchase or receive dogs known to have been stolen, but others\r\nbought and speculated in them. If an advertisement appeared offering a\r\nreward for the dog, a negotiation was entered into. If no reward was\r\noffered, the owner of the dog, who was always either known or made out,\r\nwas waited upon by a restorer, who undertook “to restore the dog if\r\nterms could be come to.” A dog belonging to Colonel Fox was once kept\r\nsix weeks before the thieves would consent to the Colonel’s terms. One\r\nof the most successful restorers was a shoemaker, and mixed little\r\nwith the actual stealers; the dog-dealers, however, acted as restorers\r\nfrequently enough. If the person robbed paid a good round sum for the\r\nrestoration of a dog, and paid it speedily, the animal was almost\r\ncertain to be stolen a second time, and a higher sum was then demanded.\r\nSometimes the thieves threatened that if they were any longer trifled\r\nwith they would inflict torture on the dog, or cut its throat. One\r\nlady, Miss Brown of Bolton-street, was so worried by these threats, and\r\nby having twice to redeem her dog, “that she has left England,” said\r\nMr. Bishop, “and I really do believe for the sake of keeping the dog.”\r\nIt does not appear, as far as the evidence shows, that these threats\r\nof torture or death were ever carried into execution; some of the\r\nwitnesses had merely heard of such things.\r\n\r\nThe shoemaker alluded to was named Taylor, and Inspector Shackell\r\nthus describes this person’s way of transacting business in the dog\r\n“restoring” line: “There is a man named Taylor, who is one of the\r\ngreatest restorers in London of stolen dogs, through Mr. Bishop.” [Mr.\r\nBishop was a gunmaker in Bond-street.] “It is a disgrace to London that\r\nany person should encourage a man like that to go to extort money from\r\nladies and gentlemen, especially a respectable man. A gentleman applied\r\nto me to get a valuable dog that was stolen, with a chain on his neck,\r\nand the name on the collar; and I heard Mr. Bishop himself say that\r\nit cost 6_l._; that it could not be got for less. Capt. Vansittart\r\n(the owner of the dog) came out; I asked him particularly, ‘Will you\r\ngive me a description of the dog on a piece of paper,’ and that is his\r\nwriting (producing a paper). I went and made inquiry; and the captain\r\nhimself, who lives in Belgrave-square, said he had no objection to\r\ngive 4_l._ for the recovery of the dog, but would not give the 6_l._ I\r\nwent and took a good deal of trouble about it. I found out that Taylor\r\nwent first to ascertain what the owner of the dog would give for it,\r\nand then went and offered 1_l._ for the dog, then 2_l._, and at last\r\npurchased it for 3_l._; and went and told Capt. Vansittart that he had\r\ngiven 4_l._ for the dog; and the dog went back through the hands of Mr.\r\nBishop.”\r\n\r\nThe “restorers” had, it appears, the lion’s share in the profits of\r\nthis business. One witness had known of as much as ten guineas being\r\ngiven for the recovery of a favourite spaniel, or, as the witness\r\nstyled it, for “working a dog back,” and only two of these guineas\r\nbeing received by “the party.” The wronged individual, thus delicately\r\nintimated as the “party,” was the thief. The same witness, Mr. Hobdell,\r\nknew 14_l._ given for the restoration of a little red Scotch terrier,\r\nwhich he, as a dog-dealer, valued at four shillings!\r\n\r\nOne of the coolest instances of the organization and boldness of the\r\ndog-stealers was in the case of Mr. Fitzroy Kelly’s “favourite Scotch\r\nterrier.” The “parties,” possessing it through theft, asked 12_l._ for\r\nit, and urged that it was a reasonable offer, considering the trouble\r\nthey were obliged to take. “The dog-stealers were obliged to watch\r\nevery night,” they contended, through Mr. Bishop, “and very diligently;\r\nMr. Kelly kept them out very late from their homes, before they could\r\nget the dog; he used to go out to dinner or down to the Temple, and\r\ntake the dog with him; they had a deal of trouble before they could get\r\nit.” So Mr. Kelly was expected not only to pay more than the value of\r\nhis dog, but an extra amount on account of the care he had taken of his\r\nterrier, and for the trouble his vigilance had given to the thieves!\r\nThe matter was settled at 6_l._ Mr. Kelly’s case was but one instance.\r\n\r\nAmong the most successful of the practitioners in this street-finding\r\nbusiness were Messrs. “Ginger” and “Carrots,” but a parliamentary\r\nwitness was inclined to believe that Ginger and Carrots were nicknames\r\nfor the same individual, one Barrett; although he had been in custody\r\nseveral times, he was considered “a very superior dog-stealer.”\r\n\r\nIf the stolen dog were of little value, it was safest for the stealers\r\nto turn him loose; if he were of value, and unowned and unsought for,\r\nthere was a ready market abroad. The stewards, stokers, or seamen of\r\nthe Ostend, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburgh, and all the French steamers,\r\nreadily bought stolen fancy dogs; sometimes twenty to thirty were\r\ntaken at a voyage. A steward, indeed, has given 12_l._ for a stolen\r\nspaniel as a private speculation. Dealers, too, came occasionally\r\nfrom Paris, and bought numbers of these animals, and at what the dog\r\nforagers considered fair prices. One of the witnesses (Mr. Baker, a\r\ngame dealer in Leadenhall-market) said:--“I have seen perhaps twenty or\r\nthirty dogs tied up in a little room, and I should suppose every one\r\nof them was stolen; a reward not sufficiently high being offered for\r\ntheir restoration, the parties get more money by taking them on board\r\nthe different steam-ships and selling them to persons on board, or to\r\npeople coming to this country to buy dogs and take them abroad.”\r\n\r\nThe following statement, derived from Mr. Mayne’s evidence, shows the\r\nextent of the dog-stealing business, but only as far as came under\r\nthe cognizance of the police. It shows the number of dogs “lost” or\r\n“stolen,” and of persons “charged” with the offence, and “convicted” or\r\n“discharged.” Nearly all the dogs returned as lost, I may observe, were\r\nstolen, but there was no evidence to show the positive theft:--\r\n\r\n  +------+---------+-------+----------+------------+------------\r\n  |      |  Dogs   | Dogs  | Persons  | Convicted. | Discharged.\r\n  |      | Stolen. | Lost. | Charged. |            |\r\n  +------+---------+-------+----------+------------+------------\r\n  | 1841 |   43    |  521  |    51    |     19     |     32\r\n  | 1842 |   54    |  561  |    45    |     17     |     28\r\n  | 1843 |   60    |  606  |    38    |     18     |     20\r\n  +------+---------+-------+----------+------------+------------\r\n\r\nIn what proportion the police-known thefts stood to the whole number,\r\nthere was no evidence given; nor, I suppose, could it be given.\r\n\r\nThe dog-stealers were not considered to be connected with\r\nhousebreakers, though they might frequent the same public-houses. Mr.\r\nMayne pronounced these dog-stealers a genus, a peculiar class, “what\r\nthey call dog-fanciers and dog-stealers; a sort of half-sporting,\r\nbetting characters.”\r\n\r\nThe law on the subject of dog-stealing (8 and 9 Vict., c. 47) now is,\r\nthat “If any person shall steal any dog, every such offender shall be\r\ndeemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, being convicted thereof before any\r\ntwo or more justices of the peace, shall, for the first offence, at the\r\ndiscretion of the said justices, either be committed to the common gaol\r\nor house of correction, there to be imprisoned only, or be imprisoned\r\nand kept to hard labour, for any term not exceeding six calendar\r\nmonths, or shall forfeit and pay over and above the value of the said\r\ndog such sum of money, not exceeding 20_l._, as to the said justices\r\nshall seem meet. And if any person so convicted shall afterwards be\r\nguilty of the same offence, every such offender shall be guilty of an\r\nindictable misdemeanor, and, being convicted thereof, shall be liable\r\nto suffer such punishment, by fine or imprisonment, with or without\r\nhard labour, or by both, as the court in its discretion shall award,\r\nprovided such imprisonment do not exceed eighteen months.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A DOG-“FINDER”.--A “LURKER’S” CAREER.\r\n\r\nConcerning a dog-finder, I received the following account from one who\r\nhad received the education of a gentleman, but whom circumstances had\r\ndriven to an association with the vagrant class, and who has written\r\nthe dog-finder’s biography from personal knowledge--a biography\r\nwhich shows the _variety_ that often characterizes the career of the\r\n“lurker,” or street-adventurer.\r\n\r\n“If your readers,” writes my informant, “have passed the Rubicon of\r\n‘forty years in the wilderness,’ memory must bring back the time\r\nwhen the feet of their childish pilgrimage have trodden a beautiful\r\ngrass-plot--now converted into Belgrave-square; when Pimlico was a\r\n‘village out of town,’ and the ‘five fields’ of Chelsea were fields\r\nindeed. To write the biography of a living character is always\r\ndelicate, as to embrace all its particulars is difficult; but of the\r\ntruthfulness of my account there is no question.\r\n\r\n“Probably about the year of the great frost (1814), a French Protestant\r\nrefugee, named La Roche, sought asylum in this country, not from\r\npersecution, but from difficulties of a commercial character. He built\r\nfor himself, in Chelsea, a cottage of wood, nondescript in shape, but\r\npleasant in locality, and with ample accommodations for himself and\r\nhis son. Wife he had none. This little bazaar of mud and sticks was\r\nsurrounded with a bench of rude construction, on which the Sunday\r\nvisitors to Ranelagh used to sit and sip their curds and whey, while\r\nfrom the entrance--far removed in those days from competition--\r\n\r\n    ‘There stood uprear’d, as ensign of the place,\r\n    Of blue and red and white, a checquer’d mace,\r\n    On which the paper lantern hung to tell\r\n    How cheap its owner shaved you, and how well.’\r\n\r\nThings went on smoothly for a dozen years, when the old Frenchman\r\ndeparted this life.\r\n\r\n“His boy carried on the business for a few months, when frequent\r\ncomplaints of ‘Sunday gambling’ on the premises, and loud whispers of\r\nsuspicion relative to the concealment of stolen goods, induced ‘Chelsea\r\nGeorge’--the name the youth had acquired--to sell the good-will of the\r\nhouse, fixtures, and all, and at the eastern extremity of London to\r\nembark in business as a ‘mush or mushroom-faker.’ Independently of his\r\nappropriation of umbrellas, proper to the mush-faker’s calling, Chelsea\r\nGeorge was by no means scrupulous concerning other little matters\r\nwithin his reach, and if the proprietors of the ‘swell cribs’ within\r\nhis ‘beat’ had no ‘umbrellas to mend,’ or ‘old ’uns to sell,’ he would\r\nease the pegs in the passage of the incumbrance of a greatcoat, and\r\ntelegraph the same out of sight (by a colleague), while the servant\r\nwent in to make the desired inquiries. At last he was ‘bowl’d out’ in\r\nthe very act of ‘nailing a yack’ (stealing a watch). He ‘expiated,’\r\nas it is called, this offence by three months’ exercise on the\r\n‘cockchafer’ (tread-mill). Unaccustomed as yet to the novelty of the\r\nexercise, he fell through the wheel and broke one of his legs. He was,\r\nof course, permitted to finish his time in the infirmary of the prison,\r\nand on his liberation was presented with five pounds out of ‘the\r\nSheriffs’ Fund.’\r\n\r\n“Although, as I have before stated, he had never been out of England\r\nsince his childhood, he had some little hereditary knowledge of the\r\nFrench language, and by the kind and voluntary recommendation of one\r\nof the police-magistrates of the metropolis, he was engaged by an\r\nIrish gentleman proceeding to the Continent as a sort of supernumerary\r\nservant, to ‘make himself generally useful.’ As the gentleman was\r\nunmarried, and mostly stayed at hotels, George was to have permanent\r\nwages and ‘find himself,’ a condition he invariably fulfilled, if\r\nanything was left in his way. Frequent intemperance, neglect of duty,\r\nand unaccountable departures of property from the portmanteau of his\r\nmaster, led to his dismissal, and Chelsea George was left, without\r\nfriends or character, to those resources which have supported him for\r\nsome thirty years.\r\n\r\n“During his ‘umbrella’ enterprise he had lived in lodging-houses of\r\nthe lowest kind, and of course mingled with the most depraved society,\r\nespecially with the vast army of trading sturdy mendicants, male and\r\nfemale, young and old, who assume every guise of poverty, misfortune,\r\nand disease, which craft and ingenuity can devise or well-tutored\r\nhypocrisy can imitate. Thus initiated, Chelsea George could ‘go upon\r\nany lurk,’ could be in the last stage of consumption--actually in his\r\ndying hour--but now and then convalescent for years and years together.\r\nHe could take fits and counterfeit blindness, be a respectable\r\nbroken-down tradesman, or a soldier maimed in the service, and\r\ndismissed without a pension.\r\n\r\n“Thus qualified, no vicissitudes could be either very new or very\r\nperplexing, and he commenced operations without delay, and pursued\r\nthem long without desertion. The ‘first move’ in his mendicant career\r\nwas _taking them on the fly_; which means meeting the gentry on their\r\nwalks, and beseeching or at times menacing them till something is\r\ngiven; something in general _was_ given to get rid of the annoyance,\r\nand, till the ‘game got stale,’ an hour’s work, morning and evening,\r\nproduced a harvest of success, and ministered to an occasion of\r\ndebauchery.\r\n\r\n“His less popular, but more upright father, had once been a\r\ndog-fancier, and George, after many years vicissitude, at length\r\ntook a ‘fancy’ to the same profession, but not on any principles\r\nrecognised by commercial laws. With what success he has practised, the\r\nladies and gentlemen about the West-end have known, to their loss and\r\ndisappointment, for more than fifteen years past.\r\n\r\n“Although the police have been and still are on the alert, George\r\nhas, in every instance, hitherto escaped punishment, while numerous\r\ndetections connected with escape have enabled the offender to hold\r\nthese officials at defiance. The ‘modus operandi’ upon which George\r\nproceeds is to varnish his hands with a sort of gelatine, composed\r\nof the coarsest pieces of liver, fried, pulverised, and mixed up\r\nwith tincture of myrrh.” [This is the composition of which Inspector\r\nShackell spoke before the Select Committee, but he did not seem to know\r\nof what the lure was concocted. My correspondent continues]: “Chelsea\r\nGeorge caresses every animal who seems ‘a likely spec,’ and when his\r\nfingers have been rubbed over the dogs’ noses they become easy and\r\nperhaps willing captives. A bag carried for the purpose, receives the\r\nvictim, and away goes George, bag and all, to his printer’s in Seven\r\nDials. Two bills and no less--two and no more, for such is George’s\r\nstyle of work--are issued to describe the animal that has thus been\r\n_found_, and which will be ‘restored to its owner on payment of\r\nexpenses.’ One of these George puts in his pocket, the other he pastes\r\nup at a public-house whose landlord is ‘fly’ to its meaning, and poor\r\n‘bow-wow’ is sold to a ‘dealer in dogs,’ not very far from Sharp’s\r\nalley. In course of time the dog is discovered; the possessor refers\r\nto the ‘establishment’ where he bought it; the ‘dealer makes himself\r\n_square_,’ by giving the address of ‘the chap he bought ’un of,’ and\r\nChelsea George shows a copy of the advertisement, calls in the publican\r\nas a witness, and leaves the place ‘without the slightest imputation on\r\nhis character.’ Of this man’s earnings I cannot speak with precision:\r\nit is probable that in a ‘good year’ his clear income is 200_l._;\r\nin a bad year but 100_l._, but, as he is very adroit, I am inclined\r\nto believe that the ‘good’ years somewhat predominate, and that the\r\naverage income may therefore exceed 150_l._ yearly.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PRESENT STREET-SELLERS OF DOGS.\r\n\r\nIt will have been noticed that in the accounts I have given of the\r\nformer street-transactions in dogs, there is no mention of the\r\n_sellers_. The information I have adduced is a condensation of the\r\nevidence given before the Select Committee of the House of Commons, and\r\nthe inquiry related only to the stealing, finding, and restoring of\r\ndogs, the selling being but an incidental part of the evidence. Then,\r\nhowever, as now, the street-sellers were not implicated in the thefts\r\nor restitution of dogs, “just except,” one man told me, “as there was\r\na black sheep or two in every flock.” The black sheep, however, of\r\nthis street-calling more frequently meddled with restoring, than with\r\n“finding.”\r\n\r\nAnother street dog-seller, an intelligent man,--who, however did not\r\nknow so much as my first informant of the state of the trade in the\r\nolden time,--expressed a positive opinion, that no dog-stealer was\r\nnow a street-hawker (“hawker” was the word I found these men use).\r\nHis reasons for this opinion, in addition to his own judgment from\r\npersonal knowledge, are cogent enough: “It isn’t possible, sir,” he\r\nsaid, “and this is the reason why. We are not a large body of men. We\r\nstick pretty closely, when we are out, to the same places. We are as\r\nwell-known to the police, as any men whom they most know, by sight at\r\nany rate, from meeting them every day. Now, if a lady or gentleman has\r\nlost a dog, or it’s been stolen or strayed--and the most petted will\r\nsometimes stray unaccountably and follow some stranger or other--why\r\nwhere does she, and he, and all the family, and all the servants, first\r\nlook for the lost animal? Why, where, but at the dogs we are hawking?\r\nNo, sir, it can’t be done now, and it isn’t done in my knowledge, and\r\nit oughtn’t to be done. I’d rather make 5_s._ on an honest dog than\r\n5_l._ on one that wasn’t, if there was no risk about it either.” Other\r\ninformation convinces me that this statement is correct.\r\n\r\nOf these street-sellers or hawkers there are now about twenty-five.\r\nThere may be, however, but twenty, if so many, on any given day in the\r\nstreets, as there are always some detained at home by other avocations\r\nconnected with their line of life. The places they chiefly frequent\r\nare the Quadrant and Regent-street generally, but the Quadrant far the\r\nmost. Indeed before the removal of the colonnade, one-half at least of\r\nall the dog-sellers of London would resort there on a very wet day, as\r\nthey had the advantage of shelter, and generally of finding a crowd\r\nassembled, either lounging to pass the time, or waiting “for a fair\r\nfit,” and so with leisure to look at dogs. The other places are the\r\nWest-end squares, the banks of the Serpentine, Charing-cross, the Royal\r\nExchange, and the Bank of England, and the Parks generally. They visit,\r\ntoo, any public place to which there may be a temporary attraction of\r\nthe classes likely to be purchasers--a mere crowd of people, I was\r\ntold, was no good to the dog-hawkers, it must be a crowd of people\r\nthat had money--such as the assemblage of ladies and gentlemen who\r\ncrowd the windows of Whitehall and Parliament-street, when the Queen\r\nopens or prorogues the houses. These spectators fill the street and\r\nthe Horse-guards’ portion of the park as soon as the street mass has\r\ndispersed, and they often afford the means of a good day’s work to the\r\ndog people.\r\n\r\nTwo dogs, carefully cleaned and combed, or brushed, are carried in a\r\nman’s arms for street-vending. A fine chain is generally attached to a\r\nneat collar, so that the dog can be relieved from the cramped feel he\r\nwill experience if kept off his feet too long. In carrying these little\r\nanimals for sale--for it is the smaller dogs which are carried--the men\r\ncertainly display them to the best advantage. Their longer silken ears,\r\ntheir prominent dark eyes and black noses, and the delicacy of their\r\nfore-paws, are made as prominent as possible, and present what the\r\nmasses very well call “quite a pictur.” I have alluded to the display\r\nof the _Spaniels_, as they constitute considerably more than half of\r\nthe street trade in dogs, the “King Charleses” and the “Blenheims”\r\nbeing disposed of in nearly equal quantities. They are sold for\r\nlap-dogs, pets, carriage companions or companions in a walk, and are\r\noften intelligent and affectionate. Their colours are black, black and\r\ntan, white and liver-colour, chestnut, black and white, and entirely\r\nwhite, with many shades of these hues, and inter-blendings of them, one\r\nwith another, and with gray.\r\n\r\nThe small _Terriers_ are, however, coming more into fashion, or, as\r\nthe hawkers call it, into “vogue.” They are usually black, with tanned\r\nmuzzles and feet, and with a keen look, their hair being short and\r\nsmooth. Some, however, are preferred with long and somewhat wiry hair,\r\nand the colour is often strongly mixed with gray. A small Isle of Skye\r\nterrier--but few, I was informed know a “real Skye”--is sometimes\r\ncarried in the streets, as well as the little rough dogs known as\r\nScotch terriers. When a street-seller has a litter of terrier pups, he\r\ninvariably selects the handsomest for the streets, for it happens--my\r\ninformant did not know why, but he and others were positive that so\r\nit was--that the handsomest is the worst; “the worst,” it must be\r\nunderstood as regards the possession of choice sporting qualities, more\r\nespecially of pluck. The terrier’s education, as regards his prowess in\r\na rat-pit, is accordingly neglected; and if a gentleman ask, “Will he\r\nkill rats?” the answer is in the negative; but this is no disparagement\r\nto the sale, because the dog is sold, perhaps, for a lady’s pet, and is\r\nnot wanted to kill rats, or to “fight any dog of his weight.”\r\n\r\nThe _Pugs_, for which, 40 to 50 years ago, and, in a diminished\r\ndegree, 30 years back, there was, in the phrase of the day, “quite a\r\nrage,” provided only the pug was hideous, are now never offered in the\r\nstreets, or so rarely, that a well-known dealer assured me he had only\r\nsold one in the streets for two years. A Leadenhall tradesman, fond of\r\ndogs, but in no way connected with the trade, told me that it came to\r\nbe looked upon, that a pug was a fit companion for only snappish old\r\nmaids, and “so the women wouldn’t have them any longer, least of all\r\nthe old maids.”\r\n\r\n_French Poodles_ are also of rare street-sale. One man had a white\r\npoodle two or three years ago, so fat and so round, that a lady, who\r\npriced it, was told by a gentleman with her, that if the head and the\r\nshort legs were removed, and the inside scooped out, the animal would\r\nmake a capital muff; yet even _that_ poodle was difficult of sale at\r\n50_s._\r\n\r\nOccasionally also an _Italian Greyhound_, seeming cold and shivery on\r\nthe warmest days, is borne in a hawker’s arms, or if following on foot,\r\ntrembling and looking sad, as if mentally murmuring at the climate.\r\n\r\nIn such places as the banks of the Serpentine, or in the Regent’s-park,\r\nthe hawker does not carry his dogs in his arms, so much as let them\r\ntrot along with him in a body, and they are sure to attract attention;\r\nor he sits down, and they play or sleep about him. One dealer told me\r\nthat children often took such a fancy for a pretty spaniel, that it\r\nwas difficult for either mother, governess, or nurse, to drag them\r\naway until the man was requested to call in the evening, bringing with\r\nhim the dog, which was very often bought, or the hawker recompensed\r\nfor his loss of time. But sometimes the dog-dealers, I heard from\r\nseveral, meet with great shabbiness among rich people, who recklessly\r\ngive them no small trouble, and sometimes put them to expense without\r\nthe slightest return, or even an acknowledgment or a word of apology.\r\n“There’s one advantage in my trade,” said a dealer in live animals, “we\r\nalways has to do with principals. There’s never a lady would let her\r\nmost favouritest maid choose her dog for her. So no parkisits.”\r\n\r\nThe species which I have enumerated are all that are now sold in the\r\nstreets, with the exception of an odd “plum-pudding,” or coach-dog\r\n(the white dog with dark spots which runs after carriages), or an odd\r\nbull-dog, or bull-terrier, or indeed with the exception of “odd dogs”\r\nof every kind. The hawkers are, however, connected with the trade in\r\nsporting dogs, and often through the medium of their street traffic, as\r\nI shall show under the next head of my subject.\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity in the hawking of fancy dogs, which\r\ndistinguishes it from all other branches of street-commerce. The\r\npurchasers are all of the wealthier class. This has had its influence\r\non the manners of the dog-sellers. They will be found, in the majority\r\nof cases, quiet and deferential men, but without servility, and with\r\nlittle of the quality of speech; and I speak only of speech which\r\namong English people is known as “gammon,” and among Irish people as\r\n“blarney.” This manner is common to many; to the established trainer\r\nof race-horses for instance, who is in constant communication with\r\npersons in a very superior position in life to his own, and to whom he\r\nis exceedingly deferential. But the trainer feels that in all points\r\nconnected with his not very easy business, as well, perhaps, as in\r\ngeneral turf knowingness, his royal highness (as was the case once),\r\nor his grace, or my lord, or Sir John, was inferior to himself; and so\r\nwith all his deference there mingles a strain of quiet contempt, or\r\nrather, perhaps, of conscious superiority, which is one ingredient in\r\nthe formation of the manners I have hastily sketched.\r\n\r\nThe customers of the street-hawkers of dogs are ladies and gentlemen,\r\nwho buy what may have attracted their admiration. The kept mistresses\r\nof the wealthier classes are often excellent customers. “Many of ’em,\r\nI know,” was said to me, “dotes on a nice spaniel. Yes, and I’ve known\r\ngentlemen buy dogs for their misses; I couldn’t be mistaken when I\r\nmight be sent on with them, which was part of the bargain. If it was\r\na two-guinea dog or so, I was told never to give a hint of the price\r\nto the servant, or to anybody. _I_ know why. It’s easy for a gentleman\r\nthat wants to please a lady, and not to lay out any great matter\r\nof tin, to say that what had really cost him two guineas, cost him\r\ntwenty.” If one of the working classes, or a small tradesman, buy a dog\r\nin the streets, it is generally because he is “of a fancy turn,” and\r\nbreeds a few dogs, and traffics in them in hopes of profit.\r\n\r\nThe homes of the dog-hawkers, as far as I had means of\r\nascertaining--and all I saw were of the same character--are comfortable\r\nand very cleanly. The small spaniels, terriers, &c.,--I do not now\r\nallude to sporting dogs--are generally kept in kennels, or in small\r\nwooden houses erected for the purpose in a back garden or yard. These\r\nabodes are generally in some open court, or little square or “grove,”\r\nwhere there is a free access of air. An old man who was sitting at\r\nhis door in the summer evening, when I called upon a dog-seller, and\r\nhad to wait a short time, told me that so quiet were his next-door\r\nneighbour’s (the street-hawker’s) dogs, that for some weeks, he did not\r\nknow his newly-come neighbour was a dog-man; although he was an old\r\nnervous man himself, and couldn’t bear any unpleasant noise or smell.\r\nThe scrupulous observance of cleanliness is necessary in the rearing or\r\nkeeping of small fancy dogs, for without such observance the dog would\r\nhave a disagreeable odour about it, enough to repel any lady-buyer. It\r\nis a not uncommon declaration among dog-sellers that the animals are\r\n“as sweet as nuts.” Let it be remembered that I have been describing\r\nthe class of regular dog-sellers, making, by an open and established\r\ntrade, a tolerable livelihood.\r\n\r\nThe spaniels, terriers, &c., the stock of these hawkers, are either\r\nbred by them--and they all breed a few or a good many dogs--or they\r\nare purchased of dog-dealers (not street-sellers), or of people who\r\nhaving a good fancy breed of “King Charleses,” or “Blenheims,” rear\r\ndogs, and sell them by the litter to the hawkers. The hawkers also\r\nbuy dogs brought to them, “in the way of business,” but they are wary\r\nhow they buy any animal suspected to be stolen, or they may get into\r\n“trouble.” One man, a carver and gilder, I was informed, some ten years\r\nback, made a good deal of money by his “black-patched” spaniels. These\r\ndogs had a remarkable black patch over their eyes, and so fond was\r\nthe dog-fancier, or breeder of them, that when he disposed of them to\r\nstreet-sellers or others, he usually gave a portrait of the animals, of\r\nhis own rude painting, into the bargain. These paintings he also sold,\r\nslightly framed, and I have seen them--but not so much lately--offered\r\nin the streets, and hung up in poor persons’ rooms. This man lived in\r\nYork-square, behind the Colosseum, then a not very reputable quarter.\r\nIt is now Munster-square, and of a reformed character, but the seller\r\nof dogs and the donor of their portraits has for some time been lost\r\nsight of.\r\n\r\nThe prices at which fancy-dogs are sold in the streets are about the\r\nsame for all kinds. They run from 10_s._ to 5_l._ 5_s._, but are very\r\nrarely so low as 10_s._, as “it’s only a very scrubby thing for that.”\r\nTwo and three guineas are frequent street prices for a spaniel or small\r\nterrier. Of the dogs sold, as I have before stated, more than one-half\r\nare spaniels. Of the remainder, more than one-half are terriers; and\r\nthe surplusage, after this reckoning, is composed in about equal\r\nnumbers of the other dogs I have mentioned. The exportation of dogs\r\nis not above a twentieth of what it was before the appointment of the\r\nSelect Committee, but a French or Belgium dealer sometimes comes to\r\nLondon to buy dogs.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to fix upon any per-centage as to the profit of the\r\nstreet dog-sellers. There is the keep and the rearing of the animal to\r\nconsider; and there is the same uncertainty in the traffic as in all\r\ntraffics which depend, not upon a demand for use, but on the caprices\r\nof fashion, or--to use the more appropriate word, when writing on such\r\na subject--of “fancy.” A hawker may sell three dogs in one day, without\r\nany extraordinary effort, or, in the same manner of trading, and\r\nfrequenting the very same places, may sell only one in three days. In\r\nthe winter, the dogs are sometimes offered in public houses, but seldom\r\nas regards the higher-priced animals.\r\n\r\nFrom the best data I can command, it appears that each hawker sells\r\n“three dogs and a half, if you take it that way, splitting a dog like,\r\nevery week the year through; that is, sir, four or five one week in the\r\nsummer, when trade’s brisk and days are long, and only two or three\r\nthe next week, when trade may be flat, and in winter when there isn’t\r\nthe same chance.” Calculating, then, that seven dogs are sold by each\r\nhawker in a fortnight, at an average price of 50_s._ each, which is\r\nnot a high average, and supposing that but twenty men are trading in\r\nthis line the year through, we find that no less a sum than 9100_l._ is\r\nyearly expended in this street-trade. The weekly profit of the hawker\r\nis from 25_s._ to 40_s._ More than seven-eighths of these dogs are bred\r\nin this country, Italian greyhounds included.\r\n\r\nA hawker of dogs gave me a statement of his life, but it presented\r\nso little of incident or of change, that I need not report it. He\r\nhad assisted and then succeeded his father in the business; was a\r\npains-taking, temperate, and industrious man, seldom taking even a\r\nglass of ale, so that the tenour of his way had been even, and he was\r\nprosperous enough.\r\n\r\nI will next give an account of the connection of the hawkers of dogs\r\nwith the “sporting” or “fancy” part of the business; and of the present\r\nstate of dog “finding,” to show the change since the parliamentary\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nI may observe that in this traffic the word “fancy” has two\r\nsignifications. A dog recommended by its beauty, or any peculiarity,\r\nso that it be suitable for a pet-dog, is a “fancy” animal; so is he if\r\nhe be a fighter, or a killer of rats, however ugly or common-looking;\r\nbut the term “sporting dog” seems to become more and more used in\r\nthis case: nor is the first-mentioned use of the word “fancy,” at all\r\nstrained or very original, for it is lexicographically defined as “an\r\nopinion bred rather by the imagination than the reason, inclination,\r\nliking, caprice, humour, whim, frolick, idle scheme, vagary.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STREET DOG-SELLER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SPORTING DOGS.\r\n\r\nThe use, if use it may be styled, of sporting, or fighting dogs, is\r\nnow a mere nothing to what it once was. There are many sports--an\r\nappellation of many a brute cruelty--which have become extinct,\r\nsome of them long extinct. Herds of bears, for instance, were once\r\nmaintained in this country, merely to be baited by dogs. It was even\r\na part of royal merry-making. It was a sport altogether congenial\r\nto the spirit of Henry VIII.; and when his daughter, then Queen Mary,\r\nvisited her sister Elizabeth at Hatfield House, now the residence\r\nof the Marquess of Salisbury, there was a bear-baiting for their\r\ndelectation--_after mass_. Queen Elizabeth, on her accession to the\r\nthrone, seems to have been very partial to the baiting of bears and\r\nof bulls; for she not unfrequently welcomed a foreign ambassador with\r\nsuch exhibitions. The historians of the day intimate--they dared do\r\nno more--that Elizabeth affected these rough sports the most in the\r\ndecline of life, when she wished to seem still sprightly, active, and\r\nhealthful, in the eyes of her courtiers and her subjects. Laneham,\r\nwhose veracity has not been impeached--though Sir Walter Scott has\r\npronounced him to be as thorough a coxcomb as ever blotted paper--thus\r\ndescribes a bear-bait in presence of the Queen, and after quoting his\r\ndescription I gladly leave the subject. I make the citation in order to\r\nshow and contrast the former with the present use of sporting dogs.\r\n\r\n“It was a sport very pleasant to see the bear, with his pink eyes\r\nleering after his enemies, approach; the nimbleness and wait of the\r\ndog to take his advantage; and the force and experience of the bear\r\nagain to avoid his assaults: if he were bitten in one place, how he\r\nwould pinch in another to get free; that if he were taken once, then\r\nby what shift with biting, with clawing, with roaring with tossing and\r\ntumbling, he would work and wind himself from them; and, when he was\r\nloose, to shake his ears twice or thrice, with the blood and the slaver\r\nhanging about his physiognomy.”\r\n\r\nThe suffering which constituted the great delight of the _sport_ was\r\neven worse than this, in bull-baiting, for the bull gored or tossed the\r\ndogs to death more frequently than the bear worried or crushed them.\r\n\r\nThe principal place for the carrying on of these barbarities was\r\nat Paris Garden, not far from St. Saviour’s Church, Southwark. The\r\nclamour, and wrangling, and reviling, with and without blows, at these\r\nplaces, gave a proverbial expression to the language. “The place was\r\nlike a bear-garden,” for “gardens” they were called. These pastimes\r\nbeguiled the _Sunday_ afternoons more than any other time, and were\r\namong the chief delights of the people, “until,” writes Dr. Henry,\r\ncollating the opinions of the historians of the day, “until the refined\r\namusements of the drama, possessing themselves by degrees of the public\r\ntaste, if they did not mend the morals of the age, at least forced\r\nbrutal barbarity to quit the stage.”\r\n\r\nOf this sport in Queen Anne’s days, Strutt’s industry has collected\r\nadvertisements telling of bear and bull-baiting at Hockley-in-the-Hole,\r\nand “Tuttle”-fields, Westminster, and of dog-fights at the same places.\r\nMarylebone was another locality famous for these pastimes, and for its\r\nbreed of mastiffs, which dogs were most used for baiting the bears,\r\nwhilst bull-dogs were the antagonists of the bull. Gay, who was a\r\nsufficiently close observer, and a close observer of street-life too,\r\nas is well shown in his “Trivia,” specifies these localities in one of\r\nhis fables:--\r\n\r\n    “Both Hockley-hole and Mary-bone\r\n    The combats of my dog have known.”\r\n\r\nHockley-hole was not far from Smithfield-market.\r\n\r\nIn the same localities the practice of these sports lingered, becoming\r\nless and less every year, until about the middle of the last century.\r\nIn the country, bull-baiting was practised twenty times more commonly\r\nthan bear-baiting; for bulls were plentiful, and bears were not. There\r\nare, perhaps, none of our older country towns without the relic of\r\nits bull-ring--a strong iron ring inserted into a large stone in the\r\npavement, to which the baited bull was tied; or a knowledge of the site\r\nwhere the bull-ring was. The deeds of the baiting-dogs were long talked\r\nof by the vulgar. These sports, and the dog-fights, maintained the\r\ngreat demand for sporting dogs in former times.\r\n\r\nThe only sporting dogs now in request--apart, of course, from hunting\r\nand shooting (remnants of the old barbarous delight in torture or\r\nslaughter), for I am treating only of the street-trade, to which\r\nfox-hounds, harriers, pointers, setters, cockers, &c., &c., are\r\nunknown--are terriers and bull-terriers. Bull-dogs cannot now be\r\nclassed as sporting, but only as fancy dogs, for they are not good\r\nfighters, I was informed, one with another, their mouths being too\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the sale of sporting dogs is connected with\r\nstreet-traffic is in this wise: Occasionally a sporting-dog is offered\r\nfor sale in the streets, and then, of course, the trade is direct. At\r\nother times, gentlemen buying or pricing the smaller dogs, ask the cost\r\nof a bull-dog, or a bull-terrier or rat-terrier, and the street-seller\r\nat once offers to supply them, and either conducts them to a\r\ndog-dealer’s, with whom he may be commercially connected, and where\r\nthey can purchase those dogs, or he waits upon them at their residences\r\nwith some “likely animals.” A dog-dealer told me that he hardly knew\r\nwhat made many gentlemen so fond of bull-dogs, and they were “the\r\nfonder on ’em the more blackguarder and varmint-looking the creatures\r\nwas,” although now they were useless for sport, and the great praise of\r\na bull-dog, “never flew but at head in his life,” was no longer to be\r\ngiven to him, as there were no bulls at whose heads he could now fly.\r\n\r\nAnother dog-dealer informed me--with what truth as to the judgment\r\nconcerning horses I do not know, but no doubt with accuracy as\r\nto the purchase of the dogs--that Ibrahim Pacha, when in London,\r\nthought little of the horses which he saw, but was delighted with the\r\nbull-dogs, “and he weren’t so werry unlike one in the face hisself,”\r\nwas said at the time by some of the fancy. Ibrahim, it seems, bought\r\ntwo of the finest and largest bull-dogs in London, of Bill George,\r\ngiving no less than 70_l._ for the twain. The bull-dogs now sold by the\r\nstreet-folk, or through their agency in the way I have described, are\r\nfrom 5_l._ to 25_l._ each. The bull-terriers, of the best blood, are\r\nabout the same price, or perhaps 10 to 15 per cent. lower, and rarely\r\nattaining the tip-top price.\r\n\r\nThe bull-terriers, as I have stated, are now the chief fighting-dogs,\r\nbut the patrons of those combats--of those small imitations of the\r\nsavage tastes of the Roman Colosseum, may deplore the decay of the\r\namusement. From the beginning, until well on to the termination of\r\nthe last century, it was not uncommon to see announcements of “twenty\r\ndogs to fight for a collar,” though such advertisements were far more\r\ncommon at the commencement than towards the close of the century. Until\r\nwithin these twelve years, indeed, dog-matches were not unfrequent\r\nin London, and the favourite time for the regalement was on Sunday\r\nmornings. There were dog-pits in Westminster, and elsewhere, to which\r\nthe admission was not very easy, for only known persons were allowed\r\nto enter. The expense was considerable, the risk of punishment was not\r\na trifle, and it is evident that this Sunday game was _not supported\r\nby the poor or working classes_. Now dog-fights are rare. “There’s\r\nnot any public dog-fights,” I was told, “and very seldom any in a pit\r\nat a public-house, but there’s a good deal of it, I know, _at the\r\nprivate houses of the nobs_.” I may observe that “the nobs” is a common\r\ndesignation for the rich among these sporting people.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, occasionally dog-fights in a sporting-house, and\r\nthe order of the combat is thus described to me: “We’ll say now that\r\nit’s a scratch fight; two dogs have each their corner of a pit, and\r\nthey’re set to fight. They’ll fight on till they go down together, and\r\nthen if one leave hold, he’s sponged. Then they fight again. If a dog\r\nhas the worst of it he mustn’t be picked up, but if he gets into his\r\ncorner, then he can stay for as long as may be agreed upon, minute\r\nor half-minute time, or more than a minute. If a dog won’t go to the\r\nscratch out of his corner, he loses the fight. If they fight on, why to\r\nsettle it, one must be killed--though that very seldom happens, for if\r\na dog’s very much punished, he creeps to his corner and don’t come out\r\nto time, and so the fight’s settled. Sometimes it’s agreed beforehand,\r\nthat the master of a dog may give in for him; sometimes that isn’t to\r\nbe allowed; but there’s next to nothing of this now, unless it’s in\r\nprivate among the nobs.”\r\n\r\nIt has been said that a sportsman--perhaps in the relations of life\r\na benevolent man--when he has failed to kill a grouse or pheasant\r\noutright, and proceeds to grasp the fluttering and agonised bird and\r\nsmash its skull against the barrel of his gun, reconciles himself to\r\nthe sufferings he inflicts by the _pride of art_, the consciousness of\r\nskill--he has brought down his bird at a long shot; that, too, when he\r\ncares nothing for the possession of the bird. The same feeling hardens\r\nhim against the most piteous, woman-like cry of the hare, so shot that\r\nit cannot run. Be this as it may, it cannot be urged that in matching\r\na favourite dog there can be any such feeling to destroy the sympathy.\r\nThe men who thus amuse themselves are then utterly insensible to any\r\npang at the infliction of pain upon animals, witnessing the infliction\r\nof it merely for a passing excitement: and in this insensibility the\r\nwhole race who cater to such recreations of the wealthy, as well as\r\nthe wealthy themselves, participate. There is another feeling too at\r\nwork, and one proper to the sporting character--every man of this class\r\nconsiders the glories of his horse or his dog his own, a feeling very\r\ndear to selfishness.\r\n\r\nThe main sport now, however, in which dogs are the agents is\r\nrat-hunting. It is called hunting, but as the rats are all confined in\r\na pit it is more like mere killing. Of this sport I have given some\r\naccount under the head of rat-catching. The dogs used are all terriers,\r\nand are often the property of the street-sellers. The most accomplished\r\nof this terrier race was the famous dog Billy, the eclipse of the rat\r\npit. He is now enshrined--for a stuffed carcase is all that remains\r\nof Billy--in a case in the possession of Charley Heslop of the Seven\r\nBells behind St. Giles’s Church, with whom Billy lived and died. His\r\ngreat feat was that he killed 100 rats in five minutes. I understand,\r\nhowever, that it is still a moot point in the sporting world, whether\r\nBilly did or did not exceed the five minutes by a very few seconds. A\r\nmerely average terrier will easily kill fifty rats in a pit in eight\r\nminutes, but many far exceed such a number. One dealer told me that\r\nhe would back a terrier bitch which did not weigh 12 lbs. to kill 100\r\nrats in six minutes. The price of these dogs ranges with that of the\r\nbull-terriers.\r\n\r\nThe passion for rat-hunting is evidently on the increase, and seems to\r\nhave attained the popularity once vouchsafed to cock-fighting. There\r\nare now about seventy regular pits in London, besides a few that are\r\nrun up for temporary purposes. The landlord of a house in the Borough,\r\nfamiliar with these sports, told me that they would soon have to breed\r\nrats for a sufficient supply!\r\n\r\nBut it is not for the encounter with dogs alone, the issue being that\r\nso many rats shall be killed in a given time, that these vermin are\r\nbecoming a trade commodity. Another use for them is announced in the\r\nfollowing card:--\r\n\r\n  A FERRET MATCH.\r\n\r\n  A Rare Evening’s Sport for the Fancy will take place\r\n  at the\r\n  “---- ----,”\r\n  ---- STREET, NEW ROAD,\r\n  _On Tuesday Evening next, May 27._\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  MR. ---- ----\r\n  has backed his Ferret against Mr. W. B----’s Ferret to\r\n  kill 6 Rats each, for 10_s._ a-side.\r\n\r\n  He is still open to match his Ferret for £1 to £5 to kill\r\n  against any other Ferret in London.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Two other Matches with Terriers will come off the same\r\n  Evening._\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Matches take place every ---- Evening. Rats always\r\n  on hand for the accommodation of Gentlemen to try\r\n  their dogs.\r\n\r\n  Under the Management of ----\r\n\r\nAs a rat-killer, a ferret is not to be compared to a dog; but his\r\nuse is to kill rats in holes, inaccessible to dogs, or to drive the\r\nvermin out of their holes into some open space, where they can be\r\ndestroyed. Ferrets are worth from 1_l._ to 4_l._ They are not animals\r\nof street-sale.\r\n\r\nThe management of these sports is principally in the hands of the\r\nstreet dog-sellers, as indeed is the dog-trade generally. They are the\r\nbreeders, dealers, and sellers. They are compelled, as it were, to\r\nexhibit their dogs in the streets, that they may attract the attention\r\nof the rich, who would not seek them in their homes in the suburbs.\r\nThe evening business in rat-hunting, &c., for such it is principally,\r\nperhaps doubles the incomes I have specified as earned merely by\r\nstreet-_sale_. The amount “turned over” in the trade in sporting-dogs\r\nyearly in London, was computed for me by one of the traders at from\r\n12,000_l._ to 15,000_l._ He could not, however, lay down any very\r\nprecise statistics, as some bull-dogs, bull-terriers, &c., were bred by\r\nbutchers, tanners, publicans, horse-dealers, and others, and disposed\r\nof privately.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my account of the former condition of the dog-trade, I had to dwell\r\nprincipally on the stealing and restoring of dogs. This is now the\r\nleast part of the subject. The alteration in the law, consequent upon\r\nthe parliamentary inquiry, soon wrought a great change, especially the\r\nenactment of the 6th Sect. in the Act 8 and 9 Vict. c. 47. “Any person\r\nwho shall corruptly take any money or reward, directly or indirectly,\r\nunder pretence or upon account of aiding any person to recover any\r\ndog which shall have been stolen, or which shall be in the possession\r\nof any person not being the owner thereof, shall be guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanour, and punishable accordingly.”\r\n\r\nThere may now, I am informed, be half a dozen fellows who make a\r\nprecarious living by dog-stealing. These men generally keep out of the\r\nway of the street dog-sellers, who would not scruple, they assure me,\r\nto denounce their practices, as the more security a purchaser feels in\r\nthe property and possession of a dog, the better it is for the regular\r\nbusiness. One of these dog-stealers, dressed like a lime-burner--they\r\ngenerally appear as mechanics--was lately seen to attempt the enticing\r\naway of a dog. Any idle good-for-nothing fellow, slinking about the\r\nstreets, would also, I was informed, seize any stray dog within his\r\nreach, and sell it for any trifle he could obtain. One dealer told\r\nme that there might still be a little doing in the “restoring” way,\r\nand with that way of life were still mixed up names which figured in\r\nthe parliamentary inquiry, but it was a mere nothing to what it was\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\nFrom a man acquainted with the dog business I had the following\r\naccount. My informant was not at present connected with the dog and\r\nrat business, but he seemed to have what is called a “hankering after\r\nit.” He had been a pot-boy in his youth, and had assisted at the bar of\r\npublic-houses, and so had acquired a taste for sporting, as some “fancy\r\ncoves” were among the frequenters of the tap-room and skittle-ground.\r\nHe had speculated a little in dogs, which a friend reared, and he\r\nsold to the public-house customers. “At last I went slap into the\r\ndog-trade,” he said, “but I did no good at all. There’s a way to do it,\r\nI dare say, or perhaps you must wait to get known, but then you may\r\nstarve as you wait. I tried Smithfield first--it’s a good bit since,\r\nbut I can’t say how long--and I had a couple of tidy little terriers\r\nthat we’d bred; I thought I’d begin cheap to turn over money quick,\r\nso I asked 12_s._ a-piece for them. O, in course they weren’t a werry\r\npure sort. But I couldn’t sell at all. If a grazier, or a butcher, or\r\nanybody looked at them, and asked their figure, they’d say, ‘Twelve\r\nshillings! a dog what ain’t worth more nor 12_s._ ain’t worth a d--n!’\r\nI asked one gent a sovereign, but there was a lad near that sung out,\r\n‘Why, you only axed 12_s._ a bit since; ain’t you a-coming it?’ After\r\nthat, I was glad to get away. I had five dogs when I started, and about\r\n1_l._ 8_s._ 6_d._ in money, and some middling clothes; but my money\r\nsoon went, for I could do no business, and there was the rent, and\r\nthen the dogs must be properly fed, or they’d soon show it. At last,\r\nwhen things grew uncommon taper, I almost grudged the poor things\r\ntheir meat and their sop, for they were filling their bellies, and I\r\nwas an ’ung’ring. I got so seedy, too, that it was no use trying the\r\nstreets, for any one would think I’d stole the dogs. So I sold them\r\none by one. I think I got about 5_s._ apiece for them, for people took\r\ntheir advantage on me. After that I fasted oft enough. I helped about\r\nthe pits, and looked out for jobs of any kind, cleaning knives and\r\nspittoons at a public-house, and such-like, for a bite and sup. And I\r\nsometimes got leave to sit up all night in a stable or any out-house\r\nwith a live rat trap that I could always borrow, and catch rats to\r\nsell to the dealers. If I could get three lively rats in a night, it\r\nwas good work, for it was as good as 1_s._ to me. I sometimes won a\r\npint, or a tanner, when I could cover it, by betting on a rat-hunt\r\nwith helpers like myself--but it was only a few places we were let\r\ninto, just where I was known--’cause I’m a good judge of a dog, you\r\nsee, and if I had it to try over again, I think I could knock a tidy\r\nliving out of dog-selling. Yes, I’d like to try well enough, but it’s\r\nno use trying if you haven’t a fairish bit of money. I’d only myself\r\nto keep all this time, but that was one too many. I got leave to sleep\r\nin hay-lofts, or stables, or anywhere, and I have slept in the park.\r\nI don’t know how many months I was living this way. I got not to mind\r\nit much at last. Then I got to carry out the day and night beers for a\r\npotman what had hurt his foot and couldn’t walk quick and long enough\r\nfor supplying his beer, as there was five rounds every day. He lent\r\nme an apron and a jacket to be decent. After that I got a potman’s\r\nsituation. No, I’m not much in the dog and rat line now, and don’t see\r\nmuch of it, for I’ve very little opportunity. But I’ve a very nice\r\nScotch terrier to sell if you should be wanting such a thing, or hear\r\nof any of your friends wanting one. It’s dirt cheap at 30_s._, just\r\nabout a year old. Yes, I generally has a dog, and swops and sells. Most\r\nmasters allows that in a quiet respectable way.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET SELLERS OF LIVE BIRDS.\r\n\r\nThe bird-_sellers_ in the streets are also the bird-_catchers_ in the\r\nfields, plains, heaths, and woods, which still surround the metropolis;\r\nand in compliance with established precedent it may be proper that I\r\nshould give an account of the catching, before I proceed to any further\r\nstatement of the procedures subsequent thereunto. The bird-catchers are\r\nprecisely what I have described them in my introductory remarks. An\r\nintelligent man, versed in every part of the bird business, and well\r\nacquainted with the character of all engaged in it, said they might\r\nbe represented as of “the fancy,” in a small way, and always glad to\r\nrun after, and full of admiration of, fighting men. The bird-catcher’s\r\nlife is one essentially vagrant; a few gipsies pursue it, and they\r\nmix little in street-trades, except as regards tinkering; and the\r\nmass, not gipsies, who become bird-catchers, rarely leave it for any\r\nother avocation. They “catch” unto old age. During last winter two\r\nmen died in the parish of Clerkenwell, both turned seventy, and both\r\nbird-catchers--a profession they had followed from the age of six.\r\n\r\nThe mode of catching I will briefly describe. It is principally\r\neffected by means of nets. A bird-net is about twelve yards square;\r\nit is spread flat upon the ground, to which it is secured by four\r\n“stars.” These are iron pins, which are inserted in the field, and hold\r\nthe net, but so that the two “wings,” or “flaps,” which are indeed\r\nthe sides of the nets, are not confined by the stars. In the middle\r\nof the net is a cage with a fine wire roof, widely worked, containing\r\nthe “call-bird.” This bird is trained to sing loudly and cheerily,\r\ngreat care being bestowed upon its tuition, and its song attracts the\r\nwild birds. Sometimes a few stuffed birds are spread about the cage as\r\nif a flock were already assembling there. The bird-catcher lies flat\r\nand motionless on the ground, 20 or 30 yards distant from the edge\r\nof the net. As soon as he considers that a sufficiency of birds have\r\ncongregated around his decoy, he rapidly draws towards him a line,\r\ncalled the “pull-line,” of which he has kept hold. This is so looped\r\nand run within the edges of the net, that on being smartly pulled,\r\nthe two wings of the net collapse and fly together, the stars still\r\nkeeping their hold, and the net encircles the cage of the call-bird,\r\nand incloses in its folds all the wild birds allured round it. In fact\r\nit then resembles a great cage of net-work. The captives are secured\r\nin cages--the call-bird continuing to sing as if in mockery of their\r\nstruggles--or in hampers proper for the purpose, which are carried on\r\nthe man’s back to London.\r\n\r\nThe use of the call-bird as a means of decoy is very ancient.\r\nSometimes--and more especially in the dark, as in the taking of\r\nnightingales--the bird-catcher imitates the notes of the birds to be\r\ncaptured. A small instrument has also been used for the purpose, and to\r\nthis Chaucer, although figuratively, alludes: “So, the birde is begyled\r\nwith the merry voice of the foulers’ whistel, when it is closed in your\r\nnette.”\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the pride of the season, a bird-catcher engages a\r\ncostermonger’s poney or donkey cart, and perhaps his boy, the better\r\nto convey the birds to town. The net and its apparatus cost 1_l._ The\r\ncall-bird, if he have a good wild note--goldfinches and linnets being\r\nprincipally so used--is worth 10_s._ at the least.\r\n\r\nThe bird-catcher’s life has many, and to the constitution of some\r\nminds, irresistible charms. There is the excitement of “sport”--not the\r\nheadlong excitement of the chase, where the blood is stirred by motion\r\nand exercise--but still sport surpassing that of the angler, who plies\r\nhis finest art to capture one fish at a time, while the bird-catcher\r\ndespises an individual capture, but seeks to ensnare a flock at one\r\ntwitch of a line. There is, moreover, the attraction of idleness, at\r\nleast for intervals, and sometimes long intervals--perhaps the great\r\ncharm of fishing--and basking in the lazy sunshine, to watch the\r\nprogress of the snares. Birds, however, and more especially linnets,\r\nare caught in the winter, when it is not quite such holiday work. A\r\nbird-dealer (not a street-seller) told me that the greatest number of\r\nbirds he had ever heard of as having been caught at one pull was nearly\r\n200. My informant happened to be present on the occasion. “Pulls” of\r\n50, 100, and 150 are not very unfrequent when the young broods are all\r\non the wing.\r\n\r\nOf the bird-catchers, including all who reside in Woolwich, Greenwich,\r\nHounslow, Isleworth, Barnet, Uxbridge, and places of similar\r\ndistance, all working for the London market, there are about 200.\r\nThe localities where these men “catch,” are the neighbourhoods of\r\nthe places I have mentioned as their residences, and at Holloway,\r\nHampstead, Highgate, Finchley, Battersea, Blackheath, Putney, Mortlake,\r\nChiswick, Richmond, Hampton, Kingston, Eltham, Carshalton, Streatham,\r\nthe Tootings, Woodford, Epping, Snaresbrook, Walthamstow, Tottenham,\r\nEdmonton--wherever, in fine, are open fields, plains, or commons around\r\nthe metropolis.\r\n\r\nI will first enumerate the several birds sold in the streets, as well\r\nas the supply to the shops by the bird-catchers. I have had recourse\r\nto the best sources of information. Of the number of birds which I\r\nshall specify as “supplied,” or “caught,” it must be remembered that a\r\nnot-very-small proportion die before they can be trained to song, or\r\ninured to a cage life. I shall also give the street prices. All the\r\nbirds are caught by the nets with call-birds, excepting such as I shall\r\nnotice. I take the singing birds first.\r\n\r\nThe _Linnet_ is the cheapest and among the most numerous of what may\r\nbe called the London-caught birds, for it is caught in the nearer\r\nsuburbs, such as Holloway. The linnet, however,--the brown linnet\r\nbeing the species--is not easily reared, and for some time ill brooks\r\nconfinement. About one-half of those birds die after having been caged\r\na few days. The other evening a bird-catcher supplied 26 fine linnets\r\nto a shopkeeper in Pentonville, and next morning ten were dead. But\r\nin some of those bird shops, and bird chambers connected with the\r\nshops, the heat at the time the new broods are caught and caged,\r\nis excessive; and the atmosphere, from the crowded and compulsory\r\nfellowship of pigeons, and all descriptions of small birds, with white\r\nrats, hedgehogs, guinea-pigs, and other creatures, is often very foul;\r\nso that the wonder is, not that so many die, but that so many survive.\r\n\r\nSome bird-connoisseurs prefer the note of the linnet to that of the\r\ncanary, but this is far from a general preference. The young birds\r\nare sold in the streets at 3_d._ and 4_d._ each; the older birds,\r\nwhich are accustomed to sing in their cages, from 1_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._\r\nThe “catch” of linnets--none being imported--may be estimated, for\r\nLondon alone, at 70,000 yearly. The mortality I have mentioned is\r\nconfined chiefly to that year’s brood. One-tenth of the catch is sold\r\nin the streets. Of the quality of the street-sold birds I shall speak\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThe _Bullfinch_, which is bold, familiar, docile, and easily attached,\r\nis a favourite cage-bird among the Londoners; I speak of course as\r\nregards the body of the people. It is as readily sold in the streets\r\nas any other singing bird. Piping bullfinches are also a part of\r\nstreet-trade, but only to a small extent, and with bird-sellers who\r\ncan carry them from their street pitches, or call on their rounds,\r\nat places where they are known, to exhibit the powers of the bird.\r\nThe piping is taught to these finches when very young, and they must\r\nbe brought up by their tutor, and be familiar with him. When little\r\nmore than two months old, they begin to whistle, and then their\r\ntraining as pipers must commence. This tuition, among professional\r\nbullfinch-trainers, is systematic. They have schools of birds, and\r\nteach in bird-classes of from four to seven members in each, six being\r\na frequent number. These classes, when their education commences, are\r\nkept unfed for a longer time than they have been accustomed to, and\r\nthey are placed in a darkened room. The bird is wakeful and attentive\r\nfrom the want of his food, and the tune he is to learn is played\r\nseveral times on an instrument made for the purpose, and known as a\r\nbird-organ, its notes resembling those of the bullfinch. For an hour\r\nor two the young pupils mope silently, but they gradually begin to\r\nimitate the notes of the music played to them. When one commences--and\r\nhe is looked upon as the most likely to make a good piper--the others\r\nsoon follow his example. The light is then admitted and a portion of\r\nfood, but not a full meal, is given to the birds. Thus, by degrees,\r\nby the playing on the bird-organ (a flute is sometimes used), by the\r\nadmission of light, which is always agreeable to the finch, and by the\r\nreward of more and more, and sometimes more relishable food, the pupil\r\n“practises” the notes he hears continuously. The birds are then given\r\ninto the care of boys, who attend to them without intermission in a\r\nsimilar way, their original teacher still overlooking, praising, or\r\nrating his scholars, till they acquire a tune which they pipe as long\r\nas they live. It is said, however, that only five per cent. of the\r\nnumber taught pipe in _perfect_ harmony. The bullfinch is often pettish\r\nin his piping, and will in many instances not pipe at all, unless\r\nin the presence of some one who feeds it, or to whom it has become\r\nattached.\r\n\r\nThe system of training I have described is that practised by the\r\nGermans, who have for many years supplied this country with the best\r\npiping bullfinches. Some of the dealers will undertake to procure\r\nEnglish-taught bullfinches which will pipe as well as the foreigners,\r\nbut I am told that this is a prejudice, if not a trick, of trade.\r\nThe mode of teaching in this country, by barbers, weavers, and\r\nbird-fanciers generally, who seek for a profit from their pains-taking,\r\nis somewhat similar to that which I have detailed, but with far less\r\nelaborateness. The price of a piping bullfinch is about three guineas.\r\nThese pipers are also reared and taught in Leicestershire and Norfolk,\r\nand sent to London, as are the singing bullfinches which do not “pipe.”\r\n\r\nThe bullfinches netted near London are caught more numerously about\r\nHounslow than elsewhere. In hard winters they are abundant in the\r\noutskirts of the metropolis. The yearly supply, including those sent\r\nfrom Norfolk, &c., is about 30,000. The bullfinch is “hearty compared\r\nto the linnet,” I was told, but of the amount which are the objects of\r\ntrade, not more than two-thirds live many weeks. The price of a good\r\nyoung bullfinch is 2_s._ 6_d._ and 3_s._ They are often sold in the\r\nstreets for 1_s._ The hawking or street trade comprises about a tenth\r\nof the whole.\r\n\r\nThe sale of piping bullfinches is, of course, small, as only the rich\r\ncan afford to buy them. A dealer estimated it at about 400 yearly.\r\n\r\nThe _Goldfinch_ is also in demand by street customers, and is a\r\nfavourite from its liveliness, beauty, and sometimes sagacity. It\r\nis, moreover, the longest lived of our caged small birds, and will\r\nfrequently live to the age of fifteen or sixteen years. A goldfinch\r\nhas been known to exist twenty-three years in a cage. Small birds,\r\ngenerally, rarely live more than nine years. This finch is also in\r\ndemand because it most readily of any bird pairs with the canary, the\r\nproduce being known as a “mule,” which, from its prettiness and powers\r\nof song, is often highly valued.\r\n\r\nGoldfinches are sold in the streets at from 6_d._ to 1_s._ each, and\r\nwhen there is an extra catch, and they are nearly all caught about\r\nLondon, and the shops are fully stocked, at 3_d._ and 4_d._ each. The\r\nyearly catch is about the same as that of the linnet, or 70,000, the\r\nmortality being perhaps 30 per cent. If any one casts his eye over\r\nthe stock of hopping, chirping little creatures in the window of a\r\nbird-shop, or in the close array of small cages hung outside, or at\r\nthe stock of a street-seller, he will be struck by the preponderating\r\nnumber of goldfinches. No doubt the dealer, like any other shopkeeper,\r\ndresses his window to the best advantage, putting forward his smartest\r\nand prettiest birds. The demand for the goldfinch, especially among\r\nwomen, is steady and regular. The street-sale is a tenth of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe _Chaffinch_ is in less request than either of its congeners, the\r\nbullfinch or the goldfinch, but the catch is about half that of the\r\nbullfinch, and with the same rate of mortality. The prices are also\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n_Greenfinches_ (called _green birds_, or sometimes _green linnets_, in\r\nthe streets) are in still smaller request than are chaffinches, and\r\nthat to about one-half. Even this smaller stock is little saleable, as\r\nthe bird is regarded as “only a middling singer.” They are sold in the\r\nopen air, at 2_d._ and 3_d._ each, but a good “green bird” is worth\r\n2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n_Larks_ are of good sale and regular supply, being perhaps more\r\nreadily caught than other birds, as in winter they congregate in large\r\nquantities. It may be thought, to witness the restless throwing up of\r\nthe head of the caged sky-lark, as if he were longing for a soar in the\r\nair, that he was very impatient of restraint. This does not appear to\r\nbe so much the fact, as the lark adapts himself to the poor confines of\r\nhis prison--poor indeed for a bird who soars higher and longer than any\r\nof his class--more rapidly than other wild birds, like the linnet, &c.\r\nThe mortality of larks, however, approaches one-third.\r\n\r\nThe yearly “take” of larks is 60,000. This includes sky-larks,\r\nwood-larks, tit-larks, and mud-larks. The sky-lark is in far better\r\ndemand than any of the others for his “stoutness of song,” but\r\nsome prefer the tit-lark, from the very absence of such stoutness.\r\n“Fresh-catched” larks are vended in the streets at 6_d._ and 8_d._, but\r\na seasoned bird is worth 2_s._ 6_d._ One-tenth is the street-sale.\r\n\r\nThe larks for the supply of fashionable tables are never provided by\r\nthe London bird-catchers, who catch only “singing larks,” for the\r\nshop and street-traffic. The edible larks used to be highly esteemed\r\nin pies, but they are now generally roasted for consumption. They are\r\nprincipally the produce of Cambridgeshire, with some from Bedfordshire,\r\nand are sent direct (killed) to Leadenhall-market, where about\r\n215,000 are sold yearly, being nearly two-thirds of the gross London\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nIt is only within these twelve or fifteen years that the London dealers\r\nhave cared to trade to any extent in _Nightingales_, but they are now\r\na part of the stock of every bird-shop of the more flourishing class.\r\nBefore that they were merely exceptional as cage-birds. As it is,\r\nthe “domestication,” if the word be allowable with reference to the\r\nnightingale, is but partial. Like all migratory birds, when the season\r\nfor migration approaches, the caged nightingale shows symptoms of\r\ngreat uneasiness, dashing himself against the wires of his cage or his\r\naviary, and sometimes dying in a few days. Many of the nightingales,\r\nhowever, let the season pass away without showing any consciousness\r\nthat it was, with the race of birds to which they belonged, one for a\r\nchange of place. To induce the nightingale to sing in the daylight,\r\na paper cover is often placed over the cage, which may be gradually\r\nand gradually withdrawn until it can be dispensed with. This is to\r\ninduce the appearance of twilight or night. On the subject of this\r\nnight-singing, however, I will cite a short passage.\r\n\r\n“The Nightingale is usually supposed to withhold his notes till the sun\r\nhas set, and then to be the only songster left. This is, however, not\r\nquite true, for he sings in the day, often as sweetly and as powerfully\r\nas at night; but amidst the general chorus of other singing birds,\r\nhis efforts are little noticed. Neither is he by any means the only\r\nfeathered musician of the night. The Wood-lark will, to a very late\r\nhour, pour forth its rich notes, flying in circles round the female,\r\nwhen sitting on her nest. The Sky-lark, too, may frequently be heard\r\ntill near midnight high in the air, soaring as if in the brightness\r\nof a summer’s morning. Again we have listened with pleasure long\r\nafter dark to the warblings of a Thrush, and been awakened at two in\r\nthe morning by its sweet serenade.” It appears, however, that this\r\nnight-singing, as regards England, is on fine summer nights when the\r\ndarkness is never very dense. In far northern climates larks sing all\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that the mortality among nightingales, before\r\nthey are reconciled to their new life, is higher than that of any\r\nother bird, and much exceeding one-half. The dealers may be unwilling\r\nto admit this; but such mortality is, I have been assured on good\r\nauthority, the case; besides that, the habits of the nightingale unfit\r\nhim for a cage existence.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the nightingale is among the most difficult achievements\r\nof the profession. None are caught nearer than Epping, and the\r\ncatchers travel considerable distances before they have a chance of\r\nsuccess. These birds are caught at night, and more often by their\r\ncaptor’s imitation of the nightingale’s note, than with the aid of the\r\ncall-bird. Perhaps 1000 nightingales are reared yearly in London, of\r\nwhich three-fourths may be, more or less, songsters. The inferior birds\r\nare sold at about 2_s._ each, the street-sale not reaching 100, but the\r\nbirds, “caged and singing,” are worth 1_l._ each, when of the best; and\r\n10_s._ 12_s._ and 15_s._ each when approaching the best. The mortality\r\nI have estimated.\r\n\r\n_Redbreasts_ are a portion of the street-sold birds, but the catch is\r\nnot large, not exceeding 3000, with a mortality of about a third. Even\r\nthis number, small as it is, when compared with the numbers of other\r\nsinging birds sold, is got rid of with difficulty. There is a popular\r\nfeeling repugnant to the imprisonment, or coercion in any way, of “a\r\nrobin,” and this, no doubt has its influence in moderating the demand.\r\nThe redbreast is sold, when young, both in the shops and streets for\r\n1_s._, when caged and singing, sometimes for 1_l._ These birds are\r\nconsidered to sing best by candlelight. The street-sale is a fifth, or\r\nsometimes a quarter, all young birds, or with the rarest exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe _Thrush_, _Throstle_, or (in Scottish poetry) _Mavis_, is of good\r\nsale. It is reared by hand, for the London market, in many of the\r\nvillages and small towns at no great distance, the nests being robbed\r\nof the young, wherever they can be found. The nestling food of the\r\ninfant thrush is grubs, worms, and snails, with an occasional moth or\r\nbutterfly. On this kind of diet the young thrushes are reared until\r\nthey are old enough for sale to the shopkeeper, or to any private\r\npatron. Thrushes are also netted, but those reared by hand are much\r\nthe best, as such a rearing disposes the bird the more to enjoy his\r\ncage life, as he has never experienced the delights of the free hedges\r\nand thickets. This process the catchers call “rising” from the nest.\r\nA throstle thus “rose” soon becomes familiar with his owner--always\r\nsupposing that he be properly fed and his cage duly cleaned, for all\r\nbirds detest dirt--and among the working-men of England no bird is a\r\ngreater favourite than the thrush; indeed few other birds are held\r\nin such liking by the artisan class. About a fourth of the thrushes\r\nsupplied to the metropolitan traders have been thus “rose,” and as\r\nthey must be sufficiently grown before they will be received by the\r\ndealers, the mortality among them, when once able to feed themselves,\r\nin their wicker-work cages, is but small. Perhaps somewhere about a\r\nfourth perish in this hand-rearing, and some men, the aristocrats of\r\nthe trade, let a number go when they have ascertained that they are\r\nhens, as these men exert themselves to bring up thrushes to sing well,\r\nand then they command good prices. Often enough, however, the hens are\r\nsold cheap in the streets. Among the catch supplied by netting, there\r\nis a mortality of perhaps more than a third. The whole take is about\r\n35,000. Of the sale the streets have a tenth proportion. The prices run\r\nfrom 2_s._ 6_d._ and 3_s._ for the “fresh-caught,” and 10_s._, 1_l._,\r\nand as much as 2_l._ for a seasoned throstle in high song. Indeed I may\r\nobserve that for any singing bird, which is considered greatly to excel\r\nits mates, a high price is obtainable.\r\n\r\n_Blackbirds_ appear to be less prized in London than thrushes, for,\r\nthough with a mellower note, the blackbird is not so free a singer\r\nin captivity. They are “rose” and netted in the same manner as the\r\nthrush, but the supply is less by one-fifth. The prices, mortality,\r\nstreet-sale, &c., are in the same ratio.\r\n\r\nThe street-sale of _Canaries_ is not large; not so large, I am assured\r\nby men in the trade, as it was six or seven years ago, more especially\r\nas regarded the higher-priced birds of this open-air traffic. Canaries\r\nare now never brought from the group of islands, thirteen in number,\r\nsituate in the North Atlantic and near the African coast, and from\r\nwhich they derive their name. To these islands and to these alone (as\r\nfar as is known to ornithologists) are they indigenous. The canary is\r\na slow flyer and soon wearied; this is one reason no doubt for its not\r\nmigrating. This delightful songster was first brought into England\r\nin the reign of Elizabeth, at the era when so many foreign luxuries\r\n(as they were then considered, and stigmatised accordingly) were\r\nintroduced; of these were potatoes, tobacco, turkeys, nectarines, and\r\ncanaries. I have seen no account of what was the cost of a canary-bird\r\nwhen first imported, but there is no doubt that they were very dear,\r\nas they were found only in the abodes of the wealthy. This bird-trade\r\nseems, moreover, to have been so profitable to the Spaniards, then\r\nand now the possessors of the isles, that a government order for the\r\nkilling or setting at liberty of all hen canaries, caught with the\r\nmales, was issued in order that the breed might be confined to its\r\nnative country; a decree not attended with successful results as\r\nregards the intention of the then ruling powers.\r\n\r\nThe foreign supply to this country is now principally from Holland\r\nand Germany, where canaries are reared in great numbers, with that\r\ncare which the Dutch in especial bestow upon everything on which\r\nmoney-making depends, and whence they are sent or brought over in the\r\nspring of every year, when from nine to twelve months old. Thirty\r\nyears ago, the Tyrolese were the principal breeders and purveyors of\r\ncanaries for the London market. From about the era of the peace of\r\n1814, on the first abdication of Napoleon, for ten or twelve years\r\nthey brought over about 2000 birds yearly. They travelled the whole\r\nway on foot, carrying the birds in cages on their backs, until they\r\nreached whatever port in France or the Netherlands (as Belgium then\r\nwas) they might be bound for. The price of a canary of an average\r\nquality was then from 5_s._ to 8_s._ 6_d._, and a fair proportion were\r\nstreet-sold. At that period, I was told, the principal open-air sale\r\nfor canaries (and it is only of that I now write) was in Whitechapel\r\nand Bethnal-green. All who are familiar with those localities may smile\r\nto think that the birds chirping and singing in these especially urban\r\nplaces, were bred for such street-traffic in the valleys of the Rhætian\r\nAlps! I presume that it was the greater rapidity of communication, and\r\nthe consequent diminished cost of carriage, between England, Holland,\r\nand Germany, that caused the Tyrolese to abandon the trade as one\r\nunremunerative--even to men who will live on bread, onions, and water.\r\n\r\nI have, perhaps, dwelt somewhat at length on this portion of the\r\nsubject, but it is the most curious portion of all, for the canary is\r\nthe only one of all our singing-birds which is _solely_ a household\r\nthing. Linnets, finches, larks, nightingales, thrushes, and blackbirds,\r\nare all free denizens of the open air, as well as prisoners in our\r\nrooms, but the canary with us is unknown in a wild state. “Though not\r\nvery handy,” wrote, in 1848, a very observant naturalist, the late Dr.\r\nStanley, Bishop of Norwich, “canaries might possibly be naturalized\r\nin our country, by putting their eggs in the nests of sparrows,\r\nchaffinches, or other similar birds. The experiment has been partially\r\ntried in Berkshire, where a person for years kept them in an exposed\r\naviary out of doors, and where they seemed to suffer no inconvenience\r\nfrom the severest weather.”\r\n\r\nThe breeding of canaries in this country for the London supply has\r\ngreatly increased. They are bred in Leicester and Norwich, weavers\r\nbeing generally fond of birds. In London itself, also, they are bred to\r\na greater extent than used to be the case, barbers being among the most\r\nassiduous rearers of the canary. A dealer who trades in both foreign\r\nand home-bred birds thought that the supply from the country, and from\r\nthe Continent, was about the same, 8000 to 9000 each, not including\r\nwhat were sold by the barbers, who are regarded as “fanciers,” not to\r\nsay interlopers, by the dealers. No species of birds are ever bred by\r\nthe shop-dealers. The price of a brisk canary is 5_s._ or 6_s._; but\r\nthey are sold in the streets as low as 1_s._ each, a small cage worth\r\n6_d._ being sometimes included. These, however, are hens. As in the\r\nlife of a canary there is no transition from freedom to enthralment,\r\nfor they are in a cage in the egg, and all their lives afterwards, they\r\nare subject to a far lower rate of mortality than other street-sold\r\nbirds. A sixteenth of the number above stated as forming the gross\r\nsupply are sold in the streets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing enumeration includes all the singing-birds of\r\nstreet-traffic and street-folk’s supply. The trade I have thus sketched\r\nis certainly one highly curious. We find that there is round London\r\na perfect belt of men, employed from the first blush of a summer’s\r\ndawn, through the heats of noon, in many instances during the night,\r\nand in the chills of winter; and all labouring to give to city-pent\r\nmen of humble means one of the peculiar pleasures of the country--the\r\nsong of the birds. It must not be supposed that I would intimate that\r\nthe bird-catcher’s life, as regards his field and wood pursuits, is\r\none of hardship. On the contrary, it seems to me to be the very one\r\nwhich, perhaps unsuspected by himself, is best suited to his tastes\r\nand inclinations. Nor can we think similar pursuits partake much of\r\nhardship when we find independent men follow them for mere sport, to be\r\nrid of lassitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the detail of the birds captured for the Londoners by no means ends\r\nhere. I have yet to describe those which are not songsters, and which\r\nare a staple of street-traffic to a greater degree than birds of song.\r\nOf these my notice may be brief.\r\n\r\nThe trade in _Sparrows_ is almost exclusively a street-trade and,\r\nnumerically considered, not an inconsiderable one. They are netted\r\nin quantities in every open place near London, and in many places in\r\nLondon. It is common enough for a bird-catcher to obtain leave to catch\r\nsparrows in a wood-yard, a brick-field, or places where is an open\r\nspace certain to be frequented by these bold and familiar birds. The\r\nsparrows are sold in the streets generally at 1_d._ each, sometimes\r\nhalfpenny, and sometimes 1-1/2_d._, and for no purpose of enjoyment\r\n(as in the case of the cheap song birds), but merely as playthings for\r\nchildren; in other words, for creatures wilfully or ignorantly to be\r\ntortured. Strings are tied to their legs and so they have a certain\r\ndegree of freedom, but when they offer to fly away they are checked,\r\nand kept fluttering in the air as a child will flutter a kite. One man\r\ntold me that he had sometimes sold as many as 200 sparrows in the back\r\nstreets about Smithfield on a fine Sunday. These birds are not kept in\r\ncages, and so they can only be bought for a plaything. They oft enough\r\nescape from their persecutors.\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely for the sport of children that sparrows are\r\npurveyed, but for that of grown men, or--as Charles Lamb, if I remember\r\nrightly, qualifies it, when he draws a Pentonville sportsman with\r\na little shrubbery for his preserve--for grown cockneys. The birds\r\nfor adult recreation are shot in sparrow-matches; the gentleman\r\nslaughtering the most being, of course, the hero of a sparrow\r\n“_battue_.” One dealer told me that he had frequently supplied dozens\r\nof sparrows for these matches, at 2_s._ the dozen, but they were\r\nrequired to be fine bold birds! One dealer thought that during the\r\nsummer months there were as many sparrows caught close to and within\r\nLondon as there were goldfinches in the less urban districts. These\r\nbirds are sold direct from the hands of the catcher, so that it is\r\nless easy to arrive at statistics than when there is the intervention\r\nof dealers who know the extent of the trade carried on. I was told\r\nby several, who had no desire to exaggerate, that to estimate this\r\nsparrow-sale at 10,000 yearly, sold to children and idlers in the\r\nstreets, was too low, but at that estimate, the outlay, at 1_d._ a\r\nsparrow, would be 850_l._ The adult sportsmen may slaughter half that\r\nnumber yearly in addition. The sporting sparrows are derived from the\r\nshopkeepers, who, when they receive the order, instruct the catchers to\r\ngo to work.\r\n\r\n_Starlings_ used to be sold in very great quantities in the streets,\r\nbut the trade is now but the shadow of its former state. The starling,\r\ntoo, is far less numerous than it was, and has lost much of its\r\npopularity. It is now seldom seen in flocks of more than 40, and it is\r\nrare to see a flock at all, although these birds at one period mustered\r\nin congregations of hundreds and even thousands. Ruins, and the roofs\r\nof ancient houses and barns--for they love the old and decaying\r\nbuildings--were once covered with them. The starling was moreover\r\nthe poor man’s and the peasant’s parrot. He was taught to speak, and\r\nsometimes to swear. But now the starling, save as regards his own note,\r\nis mute. He is seldom tamed or domesticated and taught tricks. It is\r\ntrue starlings may be seen carried on sticks in the street as if the\r\ntamest of the tame, but they are “braced.” Tapes are passed round their\r\nbodies, and so managed that the bird cannot escape from the stick,\r\nwhile his fetters are concealed by his feathers, the street-seller of\r\ncourse objecting to allow his birds to be handled.\r\n\r\nStarlings are caught chiefly Ilford way, I was told, and about\r\nTurnham-green. Some are “rose” from the nest. The price is from 9_d._\r\nto 2_s._ each. About 3000 are sold annually, half in the streets. After\r\nhaving been braced, or ill-used, the starling, if kept as a solitary\r\nbird, will often mope and die.\r\n\r\n_Jackdaws_ and _Magpies_ are in less demand than might be expected from\r\ntheir vivacity. Many of the other birds are supplied the year round,\r\nbut daws and pies for only about two months, from the middle of June to\r\nthe middle of August. The price is from 6_d._ to 1_s._ and about 1000\r\nare thus disposed of, in equal quantities, one-half in the streets.\r\nThese birds are for the most part reared from the nest, but little\r\npains appear to be taken with them.\r\n\r\nThe _Redpole_ is rather a favourite bird among street-buyers,\r\nespecially where children are allowed to choose birds from a stock.\r\nI am told that they most frequently select a goldfinch or a redpole.\r\nThese birds are supplied for about two months. About 800 or 1000 is\r\nthe extent of the take. The mortality and prices are the same as with\r\nthe goldfinch, but a goldfinch in high song is worth twice as much as\r\nthe best redpole. About a third of the sale of the redpole is in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nThere are also 150 or 200 _Black-caps_ sold annually in the open air,\r\nat from 3_d._ to 5_d._ each.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese are the chief birds, then, that constitute the trade of the\r\nstreets, with the addition of an occasional yellow-hammer, wren, jay,\r\nor even cuckoo. They also, with the addition of pigeons, form the stock\r\nof the bird-shops.\r\n\r\nI have shown the number of birds caught, the number which survive for\r\nsale, and the cost; and, as usual, under the head of “Statistics,” will\r\nbe shown the whole annual expenditure. This, however, is but a portion\r\nof the London outlay on birds. There is, in addition, the cost of their\r\ncages and of their daily food. The commonest and smallest cage costs\r\n6_d._, a frequent price being 1_s._ A thrush’s basket-cage cannot be\r\nbought, unless rubbish, under 2_s._ 6_d._ I have previously shown the\r\namount paid for the green food of birds, and for their turfs, &c., for\r\nthese are all branches of street-commerce. Of their other food, such as\r\nrape and canary-seed, German paste, chopped eggs, biscuit, &c., I need\r\nbut intimate the extent by showing what birds will consume, as it is\r\nnot a portion of street-trade.\r\n\r\nA goldfinch, it has been proved by experimentalising ornithologists,\r\nwill consume _90_ grains, in weight, of canary-seed in 24 hours. A\r\ngreenfinch, for whose use 80 grains of wheat were weighed out, ate 79\r\nof them in 24 hours; and, on another occasion ate, in the same space\r\nof time, 100 grains of a paste of eggs and flour. Sixteen canaries\r\nconsumed 100 grains’ weight of food, each bird, in 24 hours. The amount\r\nof provision thus eaten was about one-sixth of the full weight of the\r\nbird’s body, or an equivalent, were a man to swallow victuals in the\r\nsame proportion, of 25 lbs. in 24 hours. I may remark, moreover, that\r\nthe destruction of caterpillars, insects, worms, &c., by the small\r\nbirds, is enormous, especially during the infancy of their nestlings.\r\nA pair of sparrows fed their brood 36 times an hour for 14 hours of a\r\nlong spring day, and, it was calculated, administered to them in one\r\nweek 3400 caterpillars. A pair of chaffinches, also, carried nearly as\r\ngreat a number of caterpillars for the maintenance of their young.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe singing-birds sold in the street are offered either singly in small\r\ncages, when the cage is sold with the bird, or they are displayed in\r\na little flock in a long cage, the buyer selecting any he prefers.\r\nThey always appear lively in the streets, or indeed a sale would be\r\nhopeless, for no one would buy a dull or sick bird. The captives are\r\nseen to hop and heard to chirp, but they are not often heard to sing\r\nwhen thus offered to the public, and it requires some little attention\r\nto judge what is but an impatient flutter, and what is the fruit of\r\nmere hilarity.\r\n\r\nThe places where the street-sellers more especially offer their birds\r\nare--Smithfield, Clerkenwell-green, Lisson-grove, the City and New\r\nroads, Shepherdess-walk, Old Street-road, Shoreditch, Spitalfields,\r\nWhitechapel, Tower-hill, Ratcliffe-highway, Commercial-road\r\nEast, Poplar, Billingsgate, Westminster Broadway, Covent-garden,\r\nBlackfriars-road, Bermondsey (mostly about Dock-head), and in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Borough Market. The street-sellers are also\r\nitinerant, carrying the birds in cages, holding them up to tempt\r\nthe notice of people whom they see at the windows, or calling at\r\nthe houses. The sale used to be very considerable in the “Cut” and\r\nLambeth-walk. Sometimes the cages with their inmates are fastened to\r\nany contiguous rail; sometimes they are placed on a bench or stall; and\r\noccasionally in cages on the ground.\r\n\r\nTo say nothing, in this place, of the rogueries of the bird-trade,\r\nI will proceed to show how the street-sold birds are frequently\r\ninferior to those in the shops. The catcher, as I have stated, is also\r\nthe street-seller. He may reach the Dials, or whatever quarter the\r\ndealer he supplies may reside in, with perhaps 30 linnets and as many\r\ngoldfinches. The dealer selects 24 of each, refusing the remaining\r\ndozen, on account of their being hens, or hurt, or weakly birds. The\r\nman then resorts to the street to effect a sale of that dozen, and\r\nthus the streets have the refuse of the shops. On the other hand,\r\nhowever, when the season is at its height, and the take of birds is\r\nthe largest, as at this time of year, the shops are “stocked.” The\r\ncages and recesses are full, and the dealer’s anxiety is to sell before\r\nhe purchases more birds. The catchers proceed in their avocation;\r\nthey must dispose of their stock; the shopkeeper will not buy “at any\r\nfigure,” and so the streets are again resorted to, and in this way\r\nfine birds are often sold very cheap. Both these liabilities prevail\r\nthe year through, but most in the summer, and keep up a sort of poise;\r\nbut I apprehend that the majority, perhaps the great majority, of the\r\nstreet-sold birds, are of an inferior sort, but then the price is much\r\nlower. On occasions when the bird-trade is overdone, the catchers will\r\nsell a few squirrels, or gather snails for the shops.\r\n\r\nThe buyers of singing-birds are eminently the working people, along\r\nwith the class of tradesmen whose means and disposition are of the\r\nsame character as those of the artisan. Grooms and coachmen are\r\nfrequently fond of birds; many are kept in the several mews, and\r\noften the larger singing-birds, such as blackbirds and thrushes.\r\nThe fondness of a whole body of artificers for any particular bird,\r\nanimal, or flower, is remarkable. No better instance need be cited\r\nthan that of the Spitalfields weavers. In the days of their prosperity\r\nthey were the cultivators of choice tulips, afterwards, though not\r\nin so full a degree, of dahlias, and their pigeons were the best\r\n“fliers” in England. These things were accomplished with little cost,\r\ncomparatively, for the weavers were engaged in tasks, grateful and\r\nnatural to their tastes and habitudes; and what was expense in the\r\ngarden or aviary of the rich, was an exercise of skill and industry\r\non the part of the silk-weaver. The humanising and even refining\r\ninfluence of such pursuits is very great, and as regards these pure\r\npleasures it is not seldom that the refinement which can appreciate\r\nthem has proceeded not to but _from_ the artisans. The operatives have\r\noften been in the van of those who have led the public taste from\r\ndelighting in the cruelty and barbarity of bear and bull-baiting and\r\nof cock-fighting--among the worst of all possible schools, and very\r\ninfluential those schools were--to the delight in some of the most\r\nbeautiful works of nature. It is easy to picture the difference of\r\nmood between a man going home from a dog-fight at night, or going home\r\nfrom a visit to his flowers, or from an examination to satisfy himself\r\nthat his birds were “all right.” The families of the two men felt the\r\ndifference. Many of the rich appear to remain mere savages in their\r\ntastes and sports. Battues, lion and hippopotamus hunting, &c.,--all\r\nare mere civilized barbarisms. When shall we learn, as Wordsworth says,\r\n\r\n    “Never to blend our pleasure or our pride\r\n    With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels.”\r\n\r\nBut the change in Spitalfields is great. Since the prevalence of low\r\nwages the weaver’s garden has disappeared, and his pigeon-cote, even if\r\nits timbers have not rotted away, is no longer stocked with carriers,\r\ndragoons, horsemen, jacobins, monks, poulters, turtles, tumblers,\r\nfantails, and the many varieties of what is in itself a variety--the\r\nfancy-pigeon. A thrush, or a linnet, may still sing to the clatter of\r\nthe loom, but that is all. The culture of the tulip, the dahlia, and\r\n(sometimes) of the fuchsia, was attended, as I have said, with small\r\ncost, still it _was_ cost, and the weaver, as wages grew lower, could\r\nnot afford either the outlay or the loss of time. To cultivate flowers,\r\nor rear doves, so as to make them a means of subsistence, requires\r\na man’s whole time, and to such things the Spitalfields man did not\r\ndevote his time, but his leisure.\r\n\r\nThe readers who have perused this work from its first appearance\r\nwill have noticed how frequently I have had to comment on the always\r\nrealized indication of good conduct, and of a superior taste and\r\ngenerally a superior intelligence, when I have found the rooms\r\nof working people contain flowers and birds. I could adduce many\r\ninstances. I have seen and heard birds in the rooms of tailors,\r\nshoemakers, coopers, cabinet-makers, hatters, dressmakers, curriers,\r\nand street-sellers,--all people of the best class. One of the most\r\nstriking, indeed, was the room of a street-confectioner. His family\r\nattended to the sale of the sweets, and he was greatly occupied at\r\nhome in their manufacture, and worked away at his peppermint-rock, in\r\nthe very heart of one of the thickliest populated parts of London,\r\nsurrounded by the song of thrushes, linnets, and goldfinches, all kept,\r\nnot for profit, but because he “loved” to have them about him. I have\r\nseldom met a man who impressed me more favourably.\r\n\r\nThe flowers in the room are more attributable to the superintending\r\ntaste of a wife or daughter, and are found in the apartments of the\r\nsame class of people.\r\n\r\nThere is a marked difference between the buyers or keepers of birds\r\nand of dogs in the working classes, especially when the dog is of a\r\nsporting or “varmint” sort. Such a dog-keeper is often abroad and so\r\nhis home becomes neglected; he is interested about rat-hunts, knows\r\nthe odds on or against the dog’s chance to dispatch his rats in the\r\ntime allotted, loses much time and customers, his employers grumbling\r\nthat the work is so slowly executed, and so custom or work falls off.\r\nThe bird-lover, on the other hand, is generally a more domestic, and,\r\nperhaps consequently, a more prosperous and contented man. It is\r\ncurious to mark the refining qualities of particular trades. I do not\r\nremember seeing a bull-dog in the possession of any of the Spitalfields\r\nsilk-weavers: with them all was flowers and birds. The same I observed\r\nwith the tailors and other kindred occupations. With slaughterers,\r\nhowever, and drovers, and Billingsgatemen, and coachmen, and cabmen,\r\nwhose callings naturally tend to blunt the sympathy with suffering, the\r\ngentler tastes are comparatively unknown. The dogs are almost all of\r\nthe “varmint” kind, kept either for rat-killing, fighting, or else for\r\ntheir ugliness. For “pet” or “fancy” dogs they have no feeling, and in\r\nsinging birds they find little or no delight.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE BIRD-CATCHERS WHO ARE STREET-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of birds are called by themselves “hawkers,” and\r\nsometimes “bird hawkers.”\r\n\r\nAmong the bird-catchers I did not hear of any very prominent\r\ncharacters at present, three of the best known and most prominent\r\nhaving died within these ten months. I found among all I saw the\r\nvagrant characteristics I have mentioned, and often united with a\r\nquietness of speech and manner which might surprise those who do not\r\nknow that any pursuit which entails frequent silence, watchfulness,\r\nand solitude, forms such manners. Perhaps the man most talked of by\r\nhis fellow-labourers, was Old Gilham, who died lately. Gilham was his\r\nreal name, for among the bird-catchers there is not that prevalence\r\nof nicknames which I found among the costermongers and patterers. One\r\nreason no doubt is, that these bird-folk do not meet regularly in the\r\nmarkets. It is rarely, however, that they know each other’s surnames,\r\nOld Gilham being an exception. It is Old Tom, or Young Mick, or Jack,\r\nor Dick, among them. I heard of no John or Richard.\r\n\r\nFor 60 years, almost without intermission, Old Gilham caught birds.\r\nI am assured that to state that his “catch” during this long period\r\naveraged 100 a week, hens included, is within the mark, for he was a\r\nmost indefatigable man; even at that computation, however, he would\r\nhave been the captor, in his lifetime, of three hundred and twelve\r\nthousand birds! A bird-catcher who used sometimes to start in the\r\nmorning with Old Gilham, and walk with him until their roads diverged,\r\ntold me that of late years the old man’s talk was a good deal of where\r\nhe had captured his birds in the old times: “‘Why, Ned,’ he would say\r\nto me, proceeded his companion, ‘I’ve catched goldfinches in lots at\r\nChalk Farm, and all where there’s that railway smoke and noise just by\r\nthe hill (Primrose Hill). I can’t think where they’ll drive all the\r\nbirds to by and bye. I dare say the first time the birds saw a railway\r\nwith its smoke, and noise to frighten them, and all the fire too, they\r\njust thought it was the devil was come.’ He wasn’t a fool, wasn’t old\r\nGilham, sir. ‘Why,’ he’d go on for to say, ‘I’ve laid many a day at\r\nBall’s Pond there, where it’s nothing but a lot of houses now, and\r\ncatched hundreds of birds. And I’ve catched them where there’s all\r\nthem grand squares Pimlico way, and in Britannia Fields, and at White\r\nCondic. What with all these buildings, and them barbers, I don’t know\r\nwhat the bird-trade’ll come to. It’s hard for a poor man to have to go\r\nto Finchley for birds that he could have catched at Holloway once, but\r\npeople never thinks of that. When I were young I could make three times\r\nas much as I do now. I’ve got a pound for a good sound chaffinch as I\r\nbrought up myself.’ Ah, poor old Gilham, sir; I wish you could have\r\nseen him, he’d have told you of some queer changes in his time.”\r\n\r\nA shopkeeper informed me that a bird-catcher had talked to him of\r\neven “queerer” changes. This man died eight or ten years ago at an\r\nadvanced age, but beyond the fact of his offering birds occasionally\r\nat my informant’s shop, where he was known merely as “the old man,” he\r\ncould tell me nothing of the ancient bird-catcher, except that he was\r\nvery fond of a talk, and used to tell how he had catched birds between\r\nfifty and sixty years, and had often, when a lad, catched them where\r\nmany a dock in London now stands. “Where there’s many a big ship now in\r\ndeep water, I’ve catched flocks of birds. I never catched birds to be\r\nsure at them docks,” he would add, “as was dug out of the houses. Why,\r\nmaster, you’ll remember their pulling down St. Katherine’s Church, and\r\nall them rummy streets the t’other side of the Tower, for a dock.” As I\r\nfind that the first dock constructed on the north side of the Thames,\r\nthe West India dock, was not commenced until the year 1800, there\r\nseems no reason to discredit the bird-catcher’s statement. Among other\r\nclasses of street-sellers I have had to remark the little observation\r\nthey extended to the changes all around, such as the extension of\r\nstreet-traffic to miles and miles of suburbs, unknown till recently.\r\nTwo thousand miles of houses have been built in London within the last\r\n20 years. But with the bird-catchers this want of observance is not so\r\nmarked. Of necessity they must notice the changes which have added to\r\nthe fatigues and difficulties of their calling, by compelling them,\r\nliterally, to “go further a-field.”\r\n\r\nA young man, rather tall, and evidently active, but very thin, gave\r\nme the following account. His manners were quiet and his voice low.\r\nHis dress could not so well be called mean as hard worn, with the\r\nunmistakable look of much of the attire of his class, that it was not\r\nmade for the wearer; his surtout, for instance, which was fastened\r\nin front by two buttons, reached down to his ancles, and could have\r\ninclosed a bigger man. He resided in St. Luke’s, in which parish there\r\nare more bird-catchers living than in any other. The furniture of his\r\nroom was very simple. A heavy old sofa, in the well of which was a bed,\r\na table, two chairs, a fender, a small closet containing a few pots\r\nand tins, and some twenty empty bird-cages of different sizes hung\r\nagainst the walls. In a sort of wooden loft, which had originally been\r\nconstructed, he believed, for the breeding of fancy-pigeons, and which\r\nwas erected on the roof, were about a dozen or two of cages, some old\r\nand broken, and in them a few live goldfinches, which hopped about very\r\nmerrily. They were all this year’s birds, and my informant, who had “a\r\nlittle connection of his own,” was rearing them in hopes they would\r\nturn out good specs, quite “birds beyond the run of the streets.” The\r\nplace and the cages, each bird having its own little cage, were very\r\nclean, but at the time of my visit the loft was exceedingly hot, as the\r\nday was one of the sultriest. Lest this heat should prove too great for\r\nthe finches, the timbers on all sides were well wetted and re-wetted at\r\nintervals, for about an hour at noon, at which time only was the sun\r\nfull on the loft.\r\n\r\n“I shall soon have more birds, sir,” he said, “but you see I only\r\nput aside here such as are the very best of the take; all cocks, of\r\ncourse. O, I’ve been in the trade all my life; I’ve had a turn at other\r\nthings, certainly, but this life suits me best, I think, because I have\r\nmy health best in it. My father--he’s been dead a goodish bit--was a\r\nbird-catcher as well, and he used to take me out with him as soon as I\r\nwas strong enough; when I was about ten, I suppose. I don’t remember\r\nmy mother. Father was brought up to brick-making. I believe that most\r\nof the bird-catchers that have been trades, and that’s not half a\r\nquarter perhaps, were brick-makers, or something that way. Well, I\r\ndon’t know the reason. The brick-making was, in my father’s young days,\r\ncarried on more in the country, and the bird-catchers used to fall in\r\nwith the brick-makers, and so perhaps that led to it. I’ve heard my\r\nfather tell of an old soldier that had been discharged with a pension\r\nbeing the luckiest bird-catcher he knowed. The soldier was a catcher\r\nbefore he first listed, and he listed drunk. I once--yes, sir, I dare\r\nsay that’s fifteen year back, for I was quite a lad--walked with my\r\nfather and captain” (the pensioner’s sobriquet) “till they parted for\r\nwork, and I remember very well I heard him tell how, when on march\r\nin Portingal--I think that’s what he called it, but it’s in foreign\r\nparts--he saw flocks of birds; he wished he could be after catching\r\nthem, for he was well tired of sogering. I was sent to school twice or\r\nthrice, and can read a little and write a little; and I should like\r\nreading better if I could manage it better. I read a penny number,\r\nor the ‘police’ in a newspaper, now and then, but very seldom. But on\r\na fine day I hated being at school. I wanted to be at work, to make\r\nsomething at bird-catching. If a boy can make money, why shouldn’t he?\r\nAnd if I’d had a net, or cage, and a mule of my own, then, I thought,\r\nI could make money.” [I may observe that the mule longed for by my\r\ninformant was a “cross” between two birds, and was wanted for the\r\ndecoy. Some bird-catchers contend that a mule makes the best call-bird\r\nof any; others that the natural note of a linnet, for instance, was\r\nmore alluring than the song of a mule between a linnet and a goldfinch.\r\nOne birdman told me that the excellence of a mule was, that it had been\r\nbred and taught by its master, had never been at large, and was “better\r\nto manage;” it was bolder, too, in a cage, and its notes were often\r\nloud and ringing, and might be heard to a considerable distance.]\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t stick to school, sir,” my informant continued, “and I don’t\r\nknow why, lest it be that one man’s best suited for one business, and\r\nanother for another. That may be seen every day. I was sent on trial\r\nto a shoemaker, and after that to a ropemaker, for father didn’t seem\r\nto like my growing up and being a bird-catcher, like he was. But I\r\nnever felt well, and knew I should never be any great hand at them\r\ntrades, and so when my poor father went off rather sudden, I took to\r\nthe catching at once and had all his traps. Perhaps, but I can’t say to\r\na niceness, that was eleven year back. Do I like the business, do you\r\nsay, sir? Well, I’m forced to like it, for I’ve no other to live by.”\r\n[The reader will have remarked how this man attributed the course he\r\npursued, evidently from natural inclination, to its being the best and\r\nmost healthful means of subsistence in his power.] “Last Monday, for my\r\ndealers like birds on a Monday or Tuesday best, and then they’ve the\r\nweek before them,--I went to catch in the fields this side of Barnet,\r\nand started before two in the morning, when it was neither light nor\r\ndark. You must get to your place before daylight to be ready for the\r\nfirst flight, and have time to lay your net properly. When I’d done\r\nthat, I lay down and smoked. No, smoke don’t scare the birds; I think\r\nthey’re rather drawn to notice anything new, if all’s quite quiet.\r\nWell, the first pull I had about 90 birds, nearly all linnets. There\r\nwas, as well as I can remember, three hedge-sparrows among them, and\r\ntwo larks, and one or two other birds. Yes, there’s always a terrible\r\nflutter and row when you make a catch, and often regular fights in the\r\nnet. I then sorted my birds, and let the hens go, for I didn’t want\r\nto be bothered with them. I might let such a thing as 35 hens go out\r\nof rather more than an 80 take, for I’ve always found, in catching\r\nyoung broods, that I’ve drawn more cocks than hens. How do I know the\r\ndifference when the birds are so young? As easy as light from dark.\r\nYou must lift up the wing, quite tender, and you’ll find that a cock\r\nlinnet has black, or nearly black, feathers on his shoulder, where\r\nthe hens are a deal lighter. Then the cock has a broader and whiter\r\nstripe on the wing than the hen has. It’s quite easy to distinguish,\r\nquite. A cock goldfinch is straighter and more larger in general than a\r\nhen, and has a broader white on his wing, as the cock linnet has; he’s\r\nblack round the beak and the eye too, and a hen’s greenish thereabouts.\r\nThere’s some gray-pates (young birds) would deceive any one until he\r\nopens their wings. Well, I went on, sir, until about one o’clock, or\r\na little after, as well as I could tell from the sun, and then came\r\naway with about 100 singing birds. I sold them in the lump to three\r\nshopkeepers at 2_s._ 2_d._ and 2_s._ 6_d._ the dozen. That was a good\r\nday, sir; a very lucky day. I got about 17_s._, the best I ever did but\r\nonce, when I made 19_s._ in a day.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s hard work is mine, because there’s such a long walking home\r\nwhen you’ve done catching. O, when you’re at work it’s not work but\r\nalmost a pleasure. I’ve laid for hours though, without a catch. I smoke\r\nto pass the time when I’m watching; sometimes I read a bit if I’ve had\r\nanything to take with me to read; then at other times I thinks. If you\r\ndon’t get a catch for hours, it’s only like an angler without a nibble.\r\nO, I don’t know what I think about; about nothing, perhaps. Yes, I’ve\r\nhad a friend or two go out catching with me just for the amusement.\r\nThey must lie about and wait as I do. We have a little talk of course:\r\nwell, perhaps about sporting; no, not horse-racing, I care nothing\r\nfor that, but it’s hardly business taking any one with you. I supply\r\nthe dealers and hawk as well. Perhaps I make 12_s._ a week the year\r\nthrough. Some weeks I’ve made between 3_l._ and 4_l._, and in winter,\r\nwhen there’s rain every day, perhaps I haven’t cleared a penny in a\r\nfortnight. That’s the worst of it. But I make more than others because\r\nI have a connection and raise good birds.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I’m stopped by the farmers when I’m at work, but not often,\r\nthough there is some of ’em very obstinate. It’s no use, for if a\r\ncatcher’s net has to be taken from one part of a farm, after he’s had\r\nthe trouble of laying it, why it must be laid in another part. Some\r\ncountry people likes to have their birds catched.”\r\n\r\nMy informant supplied shopkeepers and hawked his birds in the streets\r\nand to the houses. He had a connection, he said, and could generally\r\nget through them, but he had sometimes put a bird or two in a fancy\r\nhouse. These are the public-houses resorted to by “the fancy,” in some\r\nof which may be seen two or three dozen singing-birds for sale on\r\ncommission, through the agency of the landlord or the waiter. They are\r\nthe property of hawkers or dealers, and must be good birds, or they\r\nwill not be admitted.\r\n\r\nThe number of birds caught, and the proportion sold in the streets,\r\nI have already stated. The number of bird-catchers, I may repeat, is\r\nabout the same as that of street bird-sellers, 200.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CRIPPLED STREET BIRD-SELLER.\r\n\r\nFrom the bird-seller whose portrait will be given in the next number\r\nof this work I have received the following account. The statement\r\npreviously given was that of a catcher and street-seller, as are the\r\ngreat majority in the trade; the following narrative is that of one\r\nwho, from his infirmities, is merely a street-_seller_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CRIPPLED STREET BIRD-SELLER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe poor man’s deformity may be best understood by describing it in his\r\nown words: “I have no ancle.” His right leg is emaciated, the bone is\r\nsmaller than that of his other leg (which is not deformed), and there\r\nis no ancle joint. The joints of the wrists and shoulders are also\r\ndefective, though not utterly wanting, as in the ancle. In walking\r\nthis poor cripple seems to advance by means of a series of jerks. He\r\nuses his deformed leg, but must tread, or rather support his body,\r\non the ball of the misformed foot, while he advances his sound leg;\r\nthen, with a twist of his body, after he has advanced and stands upon\r\nhis undeformed leg and foot, he throws forward the crippled part of\r\nhis frame by the jerk I have spoken of. His arms are usually pressed\r\nagainst his ribs as he walks, and convey to a spectator the notion\r\nthat he is unable to raise them from that position. This, however, is\r\nnot the case; he can raise them, not as a sound man does, but with an\r\neffort and a contortion of his body to humour the effort. His speech\r\nis also defective, his words being brought out, as it were, by jerks;\r\nhe has to prepare himself, and to throw up his chin, in order to\r\nconverse, and then he speaks with difficulty. His face is sun-burnt and\r\nhealthy-looking. His dress was a fustian coat with full skirts, cloth\r\ntrowsers somewhat patched, and a clean coarse shirt. His right shoe was\r\nsuited to his deformity, and was strapped with a sort of leather belt\r\nround the lower part of the leg.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of book-stall keepers, as well as costermongers,\r\nswag-barrowmen, ginger-beer and lemonade sellers, orange-women,\r\nsweet-stuff vendors, root-sellers, and others, have established their\r\npitches--some of them having stalls with a cover, like a roof--from\r\nWhitechapel workhouse to the Mile End turnpike-gate; near the gate they\r\nare congregated most thickly, and there they are mixed with persons\r\nseated on the forms belonging to adjacent innkeepers, which are placed\r\nthere to allow any one to have his beer and tobacco in the open air.\r\nAmong these street-sellers and beer-drinkers is seated the crippled\r\nbird-seller, generally motionless.\r\n\r\nHis home is near the Jews’ burial-ground, and in one of the many\r\n“places” which by a misnomer, occasioned by the change in the\r\ncharacter and appearance of what _were_ the outskirts, are still\r\ncalled “Pleasant.” On seeking him here, I had some little difficulty\r\nin finding the house, and asking a string of men, who were chopping\r\nfire-wood in an adjoining court, for the man I wanted, mentioning\r\nhis name, no one knew anything about him; though when I spoke of his\r\ncalling, “O,” they said, “you want Old Billy.” I then found Billy at\r\nhis accustomed pitch, with a very small stock of birds in two large\r\ncages on the ground beside him, and he accompanied me to his residence.\r\nThe room in which we sat had a pile of fire-wood opposite the door;\r\nthe iron of the upper part of the door-latch being wanting was\r\nreplaced by a piece of wood--and on the pile sat a tame jackdaw, with\r\nthe inquisitive and askant look peculiar to the bird. Above the pile\r\nwas a large cage, containing a jay--a bird seldom sold in the streets\r\nnow--and a thrush, in different compartments. A table, three chairs,\r\nand a hamper or two used in the wood-cutting, completed the furniture.\r\nOutside the house were cages containing larks, goldfinches, and a very\r\nfine starling, of whose promising abilities the bird-seller’s sister\r\nhad so favourable an opinion that she intended to try and teach it to\r\ntalk, although that was very seldom done now.\r\n\r\nThe following is the statement I obtained from the poor fellow. The\r\nman’s sister was present at his desire, as he was afraid I could not\r\nunderstand him, owing to the indistinctness of his speech; but that was\r\neasy enough, after awhile, with a little patience and attention.\r\n\r\n“I was born a cripple, sir,” he said, “and I shall die one. I was born\r\nat Lewisham, but I don’t remember living in any place but London. I\r\nremember being at Stroud though, where my father had taken me, and\r\nbathed me often in the sea himself, thinking it might do me good. I’ve\r\nheard him say, too, that when I was very young he took me to almost\r\nevery hospital in London, but it was of no use. My father and mother\r\nwere as kind to me and as good parents as could be. He’s been dead\r\nnineteen years, and my mother died before him. Father was very poor,\r\nalmost as poor as I am. He worked in a brick-field, but work weren’t\r\nregular. I couldn’t walk at all until I was six years old, and I was\r\nbetween nine and ten before I could get up and down stairs by myself.\r\nI used to slide down before, as well as I could, and had to be carried\r\nup. When I could get about and went among other boys, I was in great\r\ndistress, I was teased so. Life was a burthen to me, as I’ve read\r\nsomething about. They used to taunt me by offering to jump me” (invite\r\nhim to a jumping match), “and to say, I’ll run you a race on one leg.\r\nThey were bad to me then, and they are now. I’ve sometimes sat down and\r\ncried, but not often. No, sir, I can’t say that I ever wished I was\r\ndead. I hardly know why I cried. I suppose because I was miserable. I\r\nlearned to read at a Sunday school, where I went a long time. I like\r\nreading. I read the Bible and tracts, nothing else; never a newspaper.\r\nIt don’t come in my way, and if it did I shouldn’t look at it, for I\r\ncan’t read over well and it’s nothing to me who’s king or who’s queen.\r\nIt can never have anything to do with me. It don’t take my attention.\r\nThere’ll be no change for me in this world. When I was thirteen my\r\nfather put me into the bird trade. He knew a good many catchers. I’ve\r\nbeen bird-selling in the streets for six-and-twenty years and more,\r\nfor I was 39 the 24th of last January. Father didn’t know what better\r\nhe could put me to, as I hadn’t the right use of my hands or feet,\r\nand at first I did very well. I liked the birds and do still. I used\r\nto think at first that they was like me; they was prisoners, and I\r\nwas a cripple. At first I sold birds in Poplar, and Limehouse, and\r\nBlackwall, and was a help to my parents, for I cleared 9_s._ or 10_s._\r\nevery week. But now, oh dear, I don’t know where all the money’s gone\r\nto. I think there’s very little left in the country. I’ve sold larks,\r\nlinnets, and goldfinches, to captains of ships to take to the West\r\nIndies. I’ve sold them, too, to go to Port Philip. O, and almost all\r\nthose foreign parts. They bring foreign birds here, and take back\r\nLondon birds. I don’t know anything about foreign birds. I know there’s\r\nmen dressed as sailors going about selling them; they’re duffers--I\r\nmean the men. There’s a neighbour of mine, that’s very likely never\r\nbeen 20 miles out of London, and when he hawks birds he always dresses\r\nlike a countryman, and duffs that way.\r\n\r\n“When my father died,” continued the man, “I was completely upset;\r\neverything in the world was upset. I was forced to go into the\r\nworkhouse, and I was there between four and five months. O, I hated\r\nit. I’d rather live on a penny loaf a day than be in it again. I’ve\r\nnever been near the parish since, though I’ve often had nothing to\r\neat many a day. I’d rather be lamer than I am, and be oftener called\r\nsilly Billy--and that sometimes makes me dreadful wild--than be in the\r\nworkhouse. It was starvation, but then I know I’m a hearty eater, very\r\nhearty. Just now I know I could eat a shilling plate of meat, but for\r\nall that I very seldom taste meat. I live on bread and butter and tea,\r\nsometimes bread without butter. When I have it I eat a quartern loaf\r\nat three meals. It depends upon how I’m off. My health’s good. I never\r\nfeel in any pain now; I did when I first got to walk, in great pain.\r\nBeer I often don’t taste once in two or three months, and this very hot\r\nweather one can’t help longing for a drop, when you see people drinking\r\nit all sides of you, but they have the use of their limbs.” [Here two\r\nlittle girls and a boy rushed into the room, for they had but to open\r\nthe door from the outside, and, evidently to tease the poor fellow,\r\nloudly demanded “a ha’penny bird.” When the sister had driven them\r\naway, my informant continued.] “I’m still greatly teased, sir, with\r\nchildren; yes, and with men too, both when they’re drunk and sober.\r\nI think grown persons are the worst. They swear and use bad language\r\nto me. I’m sure I don’t know why. I know no name they call me by in\r\nparticular when I’m teased, if it isn’t ‘Old Hypocrite.’ I can’t say\r\nwhy they call me ‘hypocrite.’ I suppose because they know no better.\r\nYes, I think I’m religious, rather. I would be more so, if I had\r\nclothes. I get to chapel sometimes.” [A resident near the bird-seller’s\r\npitch, with whom I had some conversation, told me of “Billy” being\r\nsometimes teased in the way described. Some years ago, he believed it\r\nwas at Limehouse, my informant heard a gentlemanly-looking man, tipsy,\r\nd--n the street bird-seller for Mr. _Hobbler_, and bid him go to the\r\nMansion House, or to h--l. I asked the cripple about this, but he had\r\nno recollection of it; and, as he evidently did not understand the\r\nallusion to Mr. Hobbler, I was not surprised at his forgetfulness.]\r\n\r\n“I like to sit out in the sunshine selling my birds,” he said. “If it’s\r\nrainy, and I can’t go out, because it would be of no use, I’m moped to\r\ndeath. I stay at home and read a little; or I chop a little fire-wood,\r\nbut you may be very sure, sir, its little I can do that way. I never\r\nassociate with the neighbours. I never had any pleasure, such as going\r\nto a fair, or like that. I don’t remember having ever spent a penny in\r\na place of amusement in my life. Yes, I’ve often sat all day in the\r\nsun, and of course a deal of thoughts goes through my head. I think,\r\nshall I be able to afford myself plenty of bread when I get home? And\r\nI think of the next world sometimes, and feel quite sure, quite, that\r\nI shan’t be a cripple there. Yes, that’s a comfort, for this world\r\nwill never be any good to me. I feel that I shall be a poor starving\r\ncripple, till I end, perhaps, in the workhouse. Other poor men can\r\nget married, but not such as me. But I never was in love in my life,\r\nnever.” [Among the vagrants and beggars, I may observe, there are men\r\nmore terribly deformed than the bird-seller, who are married, or living\r\nin concubinage.] “Yes, sir,” he proceeded, “I’m quite reconciled to my\r\nlameness, quite; and have been for years. O, no, I never fret about\r\nthat now; but about starving, perhaps, and the workhouse.\r\n\r\n“Before father died, the parish allowed us 1_s._ 6_d._ and a quartern\r\nloaf a week; but after he was buried, they’d allow me nothing; they’d\r\nonly admit me into the house. I hadn’t a penny allowed to me when I\r\ndischarged myself and came out. I hardly know how ever I _did_ manage\r\nto get a start again with the birds. I knew a good many catchers, and\r\nthey trusted me. Yes, they was all poor men. I did pretty tidy by bits,\r\nbut only when it was fine weather, until these five years or so, when\r\nthings got terrible bad. Particularly just the two last years with\r\nme. Do you think times are likely to mend, sir, with poor people? If\r\nworking-men had only money, they’d buy innocent things like birds to\r\namuse them at home; but if they can’t get the money, as I’ve heard them\r\nsay when they’ve been pricing my stock, why in course they can’t spend\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” said the sister, “trade’s very bad. Where my husband and\r\nI once earned 18_s._ at the fire-wood, and then 15_s._, we can’t now\r\nearn 12_s._ the two of us, slave as hard as we will. I always dread the\r\nwinter a-coming. Though there may be more fire-wood wanted, there’s\r\ngreater expenses, and it’s a terrible time for such as us.”\r\n\r\n“I dream sometimes, sir,” the cripple resumed in answer to my question,\r\n“but not often. I often have more than once dreamed I was starving and\r\ndying of hunger. I remember that, for I woke in a tremble. But most\r\ndreams is soon forgot. I’ve never seemed to myself to be a cripple in\r\nmy dreams. Well, I can’t explain how, but I feel as if my limbs was\r\nall free like--so beautiful. I dream most about starving I think, than\r\nabout anything else. Perhaps that’s when I have to go to sleep hungry.\r\nI sleep very well, though, take it altogether. If I had only plenty to\r\nlive upon there would be nobody happier. I’m happy enough when times\r\nis middling with me, only one feels it won’t last. I like a joke as\r\nwell as anybody when times is good; but that’s been very seldom lately.\r\n\r\n“It’s all small birds I sell in the street now, except at a very odd\r\ntime. That jackdaw there, sir, he’s a very fine bird. I’ve tamed him\r\nmyself, and he’s as tame as a dog. My sister’s a very good hand among\r\nbirds, and helps me. She once taught a linnet to say ‘Joey’ as plain\r\nas you can speak it yourself, sir. I buy birds of different catchers,\r\nbut haven’t money to buy the better kinds, as I have to sell at 3_d._,\r\nand 4_d._, and 6_d._ mostly. If I had a pound to lay out in a few nice\r\ncages and good birds, I think I could do middling, this fine weather\r\nparticler, for I’m a very good judge of birds, and know how to manage\r\nthem as well as anybody. Then birds is rather dearer to buy than they\r\nwas when I was first in the trade. The catchers have to go further,\r\nand I’m afeared the birds is getting scarcer, and so there’s more time\r\ntaken up. I buy of several catchers. The last whole day that I was at\r\nmy pitch I sold nine birds, and took about 3_s._ If I could buy birds\r\never so cheap, there’s always such losses by their dying. I’ve had\r\nthree parts of my young linnets die, do what I might, but not often so\r\nmany. Then if they die all the food they’ve had is lost. There goes\r\nall for nothing the rape and flax-seed for your linnets, canary and\r\nflax for your goldfinches, chopped eggs for your nightingales, and\r\nGerman paste for your sky-larks. I’ve made my own German paste when\r\nI’ve wanted a sufficient quantity. It’s made of pea-meal, treacle,\r\nhog’s-lard, and moss-seed. I sell more goldfinches than anything else.\r\nI used to sell a good many sparrows for shooting, but I haven’t done\r\nanything that way these eight or nine years. It’s a fash’nable sport\r\nstill, I hear. I’ve reared nightingales that sung beautiful, and have\r\nsold them at 4_s._ a piece, which was very cheap. They often die when\r\nthe time for their departure comes. A shopkeeper as supplied such\r\nas I’ve sold would have charged 1_l._ a piece for them. One of my\r\nfavouritest birds is redpoles, but they’re only sold in the season.\r\nI think it’s one of the most knowingest little birds that is; more\r\nknowing than the goldfinch, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n“My customers are all working people, all of them. I sell to nobody\r\nelse; I make 4_s._ or 5_s._; I call 5_s._ a good week at this time\r\nof year, when the weather suits. I lodge with a married sister; her\r\nhusband’s a wood-chopper, and I pay 1_s._ 6_d._ a week, which is cheap,\r\nfor I’ve no sticks of my own. If I earn 4_s._ there’s only 2_s._ 6_d._\r\nleft to live on the week through. In winter, when I can make next to\r\nnothing, and must keep my birds, it is terrible--oh yes, sir, if you\r\nbelieve me, terrible!”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE TRICKS OF THE BIRD-DUFFERS.\r\n\r\nThe tricks practised by the bird-sellers are frequent and systematic.\r\nThe other day a man connected with the bird-trade had to visit\r\nHolloway, the City, and Bermondsey. In Holloway he saw six men, some\r\nof whom he recognised as regular bird-catchers and street-sellers,\r\noffering sham birds; in the City he found twelve; and in Bermondsey\r\nsix, as well as he could depend upon his memory. These, he thought,\r\ndid not constitute more than a half of the number now at work as\r\nbird-“duffers,” not including the sellers of foreign birds. In the\r\nsummer, indeed, the duffers are most numerous, for birds are cheapest\r\nthen, and these tricksters, to economise time, I presume, buy of other\r\ncatchers any cheap hens suited to their purpose. Some of them, I am\r\ntold, never catch their birds at all, but purchase them.\r\n\r\nThe greenfinch is the bird on which these men’s art is most commonly\r\npractised, its light-coloured plumage suiting it to their purposes. I\r\nhave heard these people styled “bird-swindlers,” but by street-traders\r\nI heard them called “bird-duffers,” yet there appears to be no very\r\ndistinctive name for them. They are nearly all men, as is the case in\r\nthe bird trade generally, although the wives may occasionally assist\r\nin the street-sale. The means of deception, as regards the greenfinch\r\nespecially, are from paint. One aim of these artists is to make their\r\nfinch resemble some curious foreign bird, “not often to be sold so\r\ncheap, or to be sold at all in this country.” They study the birds in\r\nthe window of the naturalists’ shops for this purpose. Sometimes they\r\ndeclare these painted birds are young Java sparrows (at one time “a\r\nfashionable bird”), or St. Helena birds, or French or Italian finches.\r\nThey sometimes get 5_s._ for such a “duffing bird;” one man has been\r\nknown to boast that he once got a sovereign. I am told, however, by a\r\nbird-catcher who had himself supplied birds to these men for duffing,\r\nthat they complained of the trade growing worse and worse.\r\n\r\nIt is usually a hen which is painted, for the hen is by far the\r\ncheapest purchase, and while the poor thing is being offered for sale\r\nby the duffers, she has an unlimited supply of hemp-seed, without\r\nother food, and hemp-seed beyond a proper quantity, is a very strong\r\nstimulus. This makes the hen look brisk and bold, but if newly caught,\r\nas is usually the case, she will perhaps be found dead next morning.\r\nThe duffer will object to his bird being handled on account of its\r\ntimidity; “but it is timid only with strangers!” “When you’ve had\r\nhim a week, ma’am,” such a bird-seller will say, “you’ll find him as\r\nlovesome and tame as can be.” One jealous lady, when asked 5_s._ for\r\na “very fine Italian finch, an excellent singer,” refused to buy, but\r\noffered a deposit of 2_s._ 6_d._, if the man would leave his bird and\r\ncage, for the trial of the bird’s song, for two or three days. The\r\nduffer agreed; and was bold enough to call on the third day to hear\r\nthe result. The bird was dead, and after murmuring a little at the\r\nlady’s mismanagement, and at the loss he had been subjected to, the\r\nman brought away his cage. He boasted of this to a dealer’s assistant\r\nwho mentioned it to me, and expressed his conviction that it was true\r\nenough. The paints used for the transformation of native birds into\r\nforeign are bought at the colour-shops, and applied with camel-hair\r\nbrushes in the usual way.\r\n\r\nWhen canaries are “a bad colour,” or have grown a paler yellow\r\nfrom age, they are re-dyed, by the application of a colour sold at\r\nthe colour-shops, and known as “the Queen’s yellow.” Blackbirds are\r\ndyed a deeper black, the “grit” off a frying-pan being used for the\r\npurpose. The same thing is done to heighten the gloss and blackness\r\nof a jackdaw, I was told, by a man who acknowledged he had duffed a\r\nlittle; “people liked a gay bright colour.” In the same way the tints\r\nof the goldfinch are heightened by the application of paint. It is\r\ncommon enough, moreover, for a man to paint the beaks and legs of the\r\nbirds. It is chiefly the smaller birds which are thus made the means of\r\ncheating.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the “duffing birds” are hawked. If a young hen be passed off\r\nfor a good singing bird, without being painted, as a cock in his second\r\nsinging year, she is “brisked up” with hemp-seed, is half tipsy in\r\nfact, and so passed off deceitfully. As it is very rarely that even the\r\nmale birds will sing in the streets, this is often a successful ruse,\r\nthe bird appearing so lively.\r\n\r\nA dealer calculated for me, from his own knowledge, that 2000 small\r\nbirds were “duffed” yearly, at an average of from 2_s._ 6_d._ to 3_s._\r\neach.\r\n\r\nAs yet I have only spoken of the “duffing” of English birds, but\r\nsimilar tricks are practised with the foreign birds.\r\n\r\nIn parrot-selling there is a good deal of “duffing.” The birds are\r\n“painted up,” as I have described in the case of the greenfinches, &c.\r\nVarnish is also used to render the colours brighter; the legs and beak\r\nare frequently varnished. Sometimes a spot of red is introduced, for\r\nas one of these duffers observed to a dealer in English birds, “the\r\nmore outlandish you make them look, the better’s the chance to sell.”\r\nSometimes there is little injury done by this paint and varnish, which\r\ndisappear gradually when the parrot is in the cage of a purchaser;\r\nbut in some instances when the bird picks himself where he has been\r\npainted, he dies from the deleterious compound. Of this mortality,\r\nhowever, there is nothing approaching that among the duffed small birds.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the duffers carry really fine cockatoos, &c., and if they\r\ncan obtain admittance into a lady’s house, to display the beauty of the\r\nbird, they will pretend to be in possession of smuggled silk, &c., made\r\nof course for duffing purposes. The bird-duffers are usually dressed as\r\nseamen, and sometimes pretend they must sell the bird before the ship\r\nsails, for a parting spree, or to get the poor thing a good home. This\r\ntrade, however, has from all that I can learn, and in the words of an\r\ninformant, “seen its best days.” There are now sometimes six men thus\r\nengaged; sometimes none: and when one of these men is “hard up,” he\r\nfinds it difficult to start again in a business for which a capital of\r\nabout 1_l._ is necessary, as a cage is wanted generally. The duffers\r\nbuy the very lowest priced birds, and have been known to get 2_l._\r\n10_s._ for what cost but 8_s._, but that is a very rare occurrence, and\r\nthe men are very poor, and perhaps more dissipated than the generality\r\nof street-sellers. Parrot duffing, moreover, is seldom carried on\r\nregularly by any one, for he will often duff cigars and other things\r\nin preference, or perhaps vend really smuggled and good cigars or\r\ntobacco. Perhaps 150 parrots, paroquets, or cockatoos, are sold in this\r\nway annually, at from 15_s._ to 1_l._ 10_s._ each, but hardly averaging\r\n1_l._, as the duffer will sell, or raffle, the bird for a small sum if\r\nhe cannot dispose of it otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF FOREIGN BIRDS.\r\n\r\nThis trade is curious, but far from extensive as regards street-sale.\r\nThere is, moreover, contrary to what might be expected, a good deal\r\nof “duffing” about it. The “duffer” in English birds disguises them\r\nso that they shall look like foreigners; the duffer in what are\r\nunquestionably foreign birds disguises them that they may look _more_\r\nforeign--more Indian than in the Indies.\r\n\r\nThe word “Duffer,” I may mention, appears to be connected with the\r\nGerman _Durffen_, to want, to be needy, and so to mean literally\r\na needy or indigent man, even as the word _Pedlar_ has the same\r\norigin--being derived from the German _Bettler_, and the Dutch\r\n_Bedelaar_--a beggar. The verb _Durffen_, means also to dare, to be so\r\nbold as to do; hence, to _Durff_, or _Duff_, would signify to resort to\r\nany impudent trick.\r\n\r\nThe supply of parrots, paroquets, cockatoos, Java sparrows, or St.\r\nHelena birds, is not in the regular way of consignment from a merchant\r\nabroad to one in London. The commanders and mates of merchant vessels\r\nbring over large quantities; and often enough the seamen are allowed to\r\nbring parrots or cockatoos in the homeward-bound ship from the Indies\r\nor the African coast, or from other tropical countries, either to\r\nbeguile the tedium of the voyage, for presents to their friends, or,\r\nas in some cases, for sale on their reaching an English port. More, I\r\nam assured, although statistics are hardly possible on such a subject,\r\nare brought to London, and perhaps by one-third, than to all the other\r\nports of Great Britain collectively. Even on board the vessels of the\r\nroyal navy, the importation of parrots used to be allowed as a sort\r\nof boon to the seamen. I was told by an old naval officer that once,\r\nafter a long detention on the west coast of Africa, his ship was\r\nordered home, and, as an acknowledgment of the good behaviour of his\r\nmen, he permitted them to bring parrots, cockatoos, or any foreign\r\nbirds, home with them, not limiting the number, but of course under\r\nthe inspection of the petty officers, that there might be no violation\r\nof the cleanliness which always distinguishes a vessel of war. Along\r\nthe African coast, to the southward of Sierra Leone, the men were not\r\nallowed to land, both on account of the unhealthiness of the shores,\r\nand of the surf, which rendered landing highly dangerous, a danger,\r\nhowever, which the seamen would not have scrupled to brave, and\r\nrecklessly enough, for any impulse of the minute. As if by instinct,\r\nhowever, the natives seemed to know what was wanted, for they came off\r\nfrom the shores in their light canoes, which danced like feathers on\r\nthe surf, and brought boat-loads of birds; these the seamen bought of\r\nthem, or possessed themselves of in the way of barter.\r\n\r\nBefore the ship took her final departure, however, she was reported\r\nas utterly uninhabitable below, from the incessant din and clamour:\r\n“We might as well have a pack of women aboard, sir,” was the ungallant\r\nremark of one of the petty officers to his commander. Orders were then\r\ngiven that the parrots, &c., should be “thinned,” so that there might\r\nnot be such an unceasing noise. This was accordingly done. How many\r\nwere set at liberty and made for the shore--for the seamen in this\r\ninstance did not kill them for their skins, as is not unfrequently\r\nthe case--the commander did not know. He could but conjecture; and he\r\nconjectured that something like a thousand were released; and even\r\nafter that, and after the mortality which takes place among these birds\r\nin the course of a long voyage, a very great number were brought to\r\nPlymouth. Of these, again, a great number were sent or conveyed under\r\nthe care of the sailors to London, when the ship was paid off. The\r\nsame officer endeavoured on this voyage to bring home some very large\r\npine-apples, which flavoured, and most deliciously, parts of the ship\r\nwhen she had been a long time at sea; but every one of them rotted, and\r\nhad to be thrown overboard. He fell into the error, Captain ---- said,\r\nof having the finest fruit selected for the experiment; an error which\r\nthe Bahama merchants had avoided, and consequently they succeeded where\r\nhe failed. How the sailors fed the parrots, my informant could hardly\r\nguess, but they brought a number of very fine birds to England, some of\r\nthem with well-cultivated powers of speech.\r\n\r\nThis, as I shall show, is one of the ways by which the London supply of\r\nparrots, &c., is obtained; but the permission, as to the importation\r\nof these brightly-feathered birds, is, I understand, rarely allowed\r\nat present to the seamen in the royal navy. The far greater supply,\r\nindeed more than 90 per cent. of the whole of the birds imported, is\r\nfrom the merchant-service. I have already stated, on the very best\r\nauthority, the motives which induce merchant-seamen to bring over\r\nparrots and cockatoos. That to bring them over is an inducement to some\r\nto engage in an African voyage is shown by the following statement,\r\nwhich was made to me, in the course of a long inquiry, published in my\r\nletters in the _Morning Chronicle_, concerning the condition of the\r\nmerchant-seamen.\r\n\r\n“I would never go to that African coast again, only I make a pound or\r\ntwo in birds. We buy parrots, gray parrots chiefly, of the natives,\r\nwho come aboard in their canoes. We sometimes pay 6_s._ or 7_s._, in\r\nAfrica, for a fine bird. I have known 200 parrots on board; they make a\r\nprecious noise; but half the birds die before they get to England. Some\r\ncaptains won’t allow parrots.”\r\n\r\nWhen the seamen have settled themselves after landing in England,\r\nthey perhaps find that there is no room in their boarding-houses for\r\ntheir parrots; these birds are not admitted into the Sailors’ Home;\r\nthe seamen’s friends are stocked with the birds, and look upon another\r\nparrot as but another intruder, an unwelcome pensioner. There remains\r\nbut one course--to sell the birds, and they are generally sold to a\r\nhighly respectable man, Mr. M. Samuel, of Upper East Smithfield; and\r\nit is from him, though not always directly, that the shopkeepers and\r\nstreet-sellers derive their stock-in-trade. There is also a further\r\nmotive for the disposal of parrots, paroquets, and cockatoos to a\r\nmerchant. The seafaring owner of those really magnificent birds,\r\nperhaps, squanders his money, perhaps he gets “skinned” (stripped of\r\nhis clothes and money from being hocussed, or tempted to helpless\r\ndrunkenness), or he chooses to sell them, and he or his boarding-house\r\nkeeper takes the birds to Mr. Samuel, and sells them for what he can\r\nget; but I heard from three very intelligent seamen whom I met with in\r\nthe course of my inquiry, and by mere chance, that Mr. Samuel’s price\r\nwas fair and his money sure, considering everything, for there is\r\nusually a qualification to every praise. It is certainly surprising,\r\nunder these circumstances, that such numbers of these birds should thus\r\nbe disposed of.\r\n\r\nParrots are as gladly, or more gladly, got rid of, in any manner, in\r\ndifferent regions in the continents of Asia and America, than with\r\nus are even rats from a granary. Dr. Stanley, after speaking of the\r\nbeauty of a flight of parrots, says:--“The husbandman who sees them\r\nhastening through the air, with loud and impatient screams, looks upon\r\nthem with dismay and detestation, knowing that the produce of his\r\nlabour and industry is in jeopardy, when visited by such a voracious\r\nmultitude of pilferers, who, like the locusts of Egypt, desolate whole\r\ntracts of country by their unsparing ravages.” A contrast with their\r\nharmlessness, in a gilded cage in the houses of the wealthy, with us!\r\nThe destructiveness of these birds, is then, one reason why seamen can\r\nobtain them so readily and cheaply, for the natives take pleasure in\r\ncatching them; while as to plentifulness, the tropical regions teem\r\nwith bird, as with insect and reptile, life.\r\n\r\nOf parrots, paroquets, and cockatoos, there are 3000 imported to London\r\nin the way I have described, and in about equal proportions. They are\r\nsold, wholesale, from 5_s._ to 30_s._ each.\r\n\r\nThere are now only three men selling these brilliant birds regularly in\r\nthe streets, and in the fair way of trade; but there are sometimes as\r\nmany as 18 so engaged. The price given by a hawker for a cockatoo, &c.,\r\nis 8_s._ or 10_s._, and they are retailed at from 15_s._ to 30_s._,\r\nor more, “if it can be got.” The purchasers are the wealthier classes\r\nwho can afford to indulge their tastes. Of late years, however, I am\r\ntold, a parrot or a cockatoo seems to be considered indispensable to\r\nan inn (not a gin-palace), and the innkeepers have been among the best\r\ncustomers of the street parrot-sellers. In the neighbourhood of the\r\ndocks, and indeed along the whole river side below London-bridge, it\r\nis almost impossible for a street-seller to dispose of a parrot to an\r\ninnkeeper, or indeed to any one, as they are supplied by the seamen.\r\nA parrot which has been taught to talk is worth from 4_l._ to 10_l._,\r\naccording to its proficiency in speech. About 500 of these birds are\r\nsold yearly by the street-hawkers, at an outlay to the public of from\r\n500_l._ to 600_l._\r\n\r\nJava sparrows, from the East Indies, and from the Islands of the\r\nArchipelago, are brought to London, but considerable quantities die\r\nduring the voyage and in this country; for, though hardy enough, not\r\nmore than one in three survives being “taken off the paddy seed.” About\r\n10,000, however, are sold annually, in London, at 1_s._ 6_d._ each, but\r\na very small proportion by street-hawking, as the Java sparrows are\r\nchiefly in demand for the aviaries of the rich in town and country. In\r\nsome years not above 100 may be sold in the streets; in others, as many\r\nas 500.\r\n\r\nIn St. Helena birds, known also as wax-bills and red-backs, there is\r\na trade to the same extent, both as regards number and price; but the\r\nstreet-sale is perhaps 10 per cent. lower.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF BIRDS’-NESTS.\r\n\r\nThe young gypsy-looking lad, who gave me the following account of the\r\nsale of birds’-nests in the streets, was peculiarly picturesque in his\r\nappearance. He wore a dirty-looking smock-frock with large pockets\r\nat the side; he had no shirt; and his long black hair hung in curls\r\nabout him, contrasting strongly with his bare white neck and chest.\r\nThe broad-brimmed brown Italian-looking hat, broken in and ragged at\r\nthe top, threw a dark half-mask-like shadow over the upper part of his\r\nface. His feet were bare and black with mud: he carried in one hand his\r\nbasket of nests, dotted with their many-coloured eggs; in the other he\r\nheld a live snake, that writhed and twisted as its metallic-looking\r\nskin glistened in the sun; now over, and now round, the thick knotty\r\nbough of a tree that he used for a stick. The portrait of the youth is\r\nhere given. I have never seen so picturesque a specimen of the English\r\nnomads. He said, in answer to my inquiries:--\r\n\r\n“I am a seller of birds’-nesties, snakes, slow-worms, adders,\r\n‘effets’--lizards is their common name--hedgehogs (for killing black\r\nbeetles); frogs (for the French--they eats ’em); snails (for birds);\r\nthat’s all I sell in the summer-time. In the winter I get all kinds\r\nof wild flowers and roots, primroses, ‘butter-cups’ and daisies, and\r\nsnow-drops, and ‘backing’ off of trees; (‘backing’ it’s called, because\r\nit’s used to put at the back of nosegays, it’s got off the yew trees,\r\nand is the green yew fern). I gather bulrushes in the summer-time,\r\nbesides what I told you; some buys bulrushes for stuffing; they’re the\r\nfairy rushes the small ones, and the big ones is bulrushes. The small\r\nones is used for ‘stuffing,’ that is, for showing off the birds as is\r\nstuffed, and make ’em seem as if they was alive in their cases, and\r\namong the rushes; I sell them to the bird-stuffers at 1_d._ a dozen.\r\nThe big rushes the boys buys to play with and beat one another--on a\r\nSunday evening mostly. The birds’-nesties I get from 1_d._ to 3_d._\r\na-piece for. I never have young birds, I can never sell ’em; you see\r\nthe young things generally dies of the cramp before you can get rid\r\nof them. I sell the birds’-nesties in the streets; the threepenny\r\nones has six eggs, a half-penny a egg. The linnets has mostly four\r\neggs, they’re 4_d._ the nest; they’re for putting under canaries, and\r\nbeing hatched by them. The thrushes has from four to five--five is\r\nthe most; they’re 2_d._; they’re merely for cur’osity--glass cases or\r\nanything like that. Moor-hens, wot build on the moors, has from eight\r\nto nine eggs, and is 1_d._ a-piece; they’re for hatching underneath a\r\nbantam-fowl, the same as partridges. Chaffinches has five eggs; they’re\r\n3_d._, and is for cur’osity. Hedge-sparrows, five eggs; they’re the\r\nsame price as the other, and is for cur’osity. The Bottletit--the\r\nnest and the bough are always put in glass cases; it’s a long hanging\r\nnest, like a bottle, with a hole about as big as a sixpence, and\r\nthere’s mostly as many as eighteen eggs; they’ve been known to lay\r\nthirty-three. To the house-sparrow there is five eggs; they’re 1_d._\r\nThe yellow-hammers, with five eggs, is 2_d._ The water-wagtails, with\r\nfour eggs, 2_d._ Blackbirds, with five eggs, 2_d._ The golden-crest\r\nwren, with ten eggs--it has a very handsome nest--is 6_d._ Bulfinches,\r\nfour eggs, 1_s._; they’re for hatching, and the bulfinch is a very dear\r\nbird. Crows, four eggs, 4_d._ Magpies, four eggs, 4_d._ Starlings, five\r\neggs, 3_d._ The egg-chats, five eggs, 2_d._ Goldfinches, five eggs,\r\n6_d._, for hatching. Martins, five eggs, 3_d._ The swallow, four eggs,\r\n6_d._; it’s so dear because the nest is such a cur’osity, they build up\r\nagain the house. The butcher-birds--hedge-murderers some calls them,\r\nfor the number of birds they kills--five eggs, 3_d._ The cuckoo--they\r\nnever has a nest, but lays in the hedge-sparrow’s; there’s only one egg\r\n(it’s very rare you see the two, they has been got, but that’s seldom)\r\nthat is 4_d._, the egg is such a cur’osity. The greenfinches has four\r\nor five eggs, and is 3_d._ The sparrer-hawk has four eggs, and they’re\r\n6_d._ The reed-sparrow--they builds in the reeds close where the\r\nbulrushes grow; they has four eggs, and is 2_d._ The wood-pigeon has\r\ntwo eggs, and they’re 4_d._ The horned owl, four eggs; they’re 6_d._\r\nThe woodpecker--I never see no more nor two--they’re 6_d._ the two;\r\nthey’re a great cur’osity, very seldom found. The kingfishers has four\r\neggs, and is 6_d._ That’s all I know of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET-SELLER OF BIRDS’ NESTS.]\r\n\r\n“I gets the eggs mostly from Witham and Chelmsford, in Essex;\r\nChelmsford is 20 mile from Whitechapel Church, and Witham, 8 mile\r\nfurther. I know more about them parts than anywhere else, being used\r\nto go after moss for Mr. Butler, of the herb-shop in Covent Garden.\r\nSometimes I go to Shirley Common and Shirley Wood, that’s three miles\r\nfrom Croydon, and Croydon is ten from Westminster-bridge. When I’m\r\nout bird-nesting I take all the cross country roads across fields\r\nand into the woods. I begin bird-nesting in May and leave off about\r\nAugust, and then comes the bulrushing, and they last till Christmas;\r\nand after that comes the roots and wild flowers, which serves me up\r\nto May again. I go out bird-nesting three times a week. I go away at\r\nnight, and come up on the morning of the day after. I’m away a day and\r\ntwo nights. I start between one and two in the morning and walk all\r\nnight--for the coolness--you see the weather’s so hot you can’t\r\ndo it in the daytime. When I get down I go to sleep for a couple of\r\nhours. I ‘skipper it’--turn in under a hedge or anywhere. I get down\r\nabout nine in the morning, at Chelmsford, and about one if I go to\r\nWitham. After I’ve had my sleep I start off to get my nests and things.\r\nI climb the trees, often I go up a dozen in the day, and many a time\r\nthere’s nothing in the nest when I get up. I only fell once; I got on\r\nthe end of the bough and slipped off. I p’isoned my foot once with the\r\nstagnant water going after the bulrushes,--there was horseleeches,\r\nand effets, and all kinds of things in the water, and they stung me,\r\nI think. I couldn’t use my foot hardly for six weeks afterwards, and\r\nwas obliged to have a stick to walk with. I couldn’t get about at all\r\nfor four days, and should have starved if it hadn’t been that a young\r\nman kept me. He was a printer by trade, and almost a stranger to me,\r\nonly he seed me and took pity on me. When I fell off the bough I wasn’t\r\nmuch hurt, nothing to speak of. The house-sparrow is the worst nest of\r\nall to take; it’s no value either when it _is_ got, and is the most\r\ndifficult of all to get at. You has to get up a sparapet (a parapet)\r\nof a house, and either to get permission, or run the risk of going\r\nafter it without. Partridges’ eggs (they has no nest) they gives you\r\nsix months for, if they see you selling them, because it’s game, and\r\nI haven’t no licence; but while you’re hawking, that is showing ’em,\r\nthey can’t touch you. The owl is a very difficult nest to get, they\r\nbuilds so high in the trees. The bottle-tit is a hard nest to find; you\r\nmay go all the year round, and, perhaps, only get one. The nest I like\r\nbest to get is the chaffinch, because they’re in the hedge, and is no\r\nbother. Oh, you hasn’t got the skylark down, sir; they builds on the\r\nground, and has five eggs; I sell them for 4_d._ The robin-redbreast\r\nhas five eggs, too, and is 3_d._ The ringdove has two eggs, and is\r\n6_d._ The tit-lark--that’s five blue eggs, and very rare--I get 4_d._\r\nfor them. The jay has five eggs, and a flat nest, very wiry, indeed;\r\nit’s a ground bird; that’s 1_s._--the egg is just like a partridge egg.\r\nWhen I first took a kingfisher’s nest, I didn’t know the name of it,\r\nand I kept wondering what it was. I daresay I asked three dozen people,\r\nand none of them could tell me. At last a bird-fancier, the lame man\r\nat the Mile-end gate, told me what it was. I likes to get the nesties\r\nto sell, but I havn’t no fancy for birds. Sometimes I get squirrels’\r\nnesties with the young in ’em--about four of ’em there mostly is, and\r\nthey’re the only young things I take--the young birds I leaves; they’re\r\nno good to me. The four squirrels brings me from 6_s._ to 8_s._ After\r\nI takes a bird’s nest, the old bird comes dancing over it, chirupping,\r\nand crying, and flying all about. When they lose their nest they wander\r\nabout, and don’t know where to go. Oftentimes I wouldn’t take them if\r\nit wasn’t for the want of the victuals, it seems such a pity to disturb\r\n’em after they’ve made their little bits of places. Bats I never take\r\nmyself--I can’t get over ’em. If I has an order for ’em, I buys ’em of\r\nboys.\r\n\r\n“I mostly start off into the country on Monday and come up on\r\nWednesday. The most nesties as ever I took is twenty-two, and I\r\ngenerally get about twelve or thirteen. These, if I’ve an order, I sell\r\ndirectly, or else I may be two days, and sometimes longer, hawking them\r\nin the street. Directly I’ve sold them I go off again that night, if\r\nit’s fine; though I often go in the wet, and then I borrow a tarpaulin\r\nof a man in the street where I live. If I’ve a quick sale I get down\r\nand back three times in a week, but then I don’t go so far as Witham,\r\nsometimes only to Rumford; that is 12 miles from Whitechapel Church.\r\nI never got an order from a bird-fancier; they gets all the eggs they\r\nwant of the countrymen who comes up to market.\r\n\r\n“It’s gentlemen I gets my orders of, and then mostly they tells me to\r\nbring ’em one nest of every kind I can get hold of, and that will often\r\nlast me three months in the summer. There’s one gentleman as I sells to\r\nis a wholesale dealer in window-glass--and he has a hobby for them. He\r\nputs ’em into glass cases, and makes presents of ’em to his friends. He\r\nhas been one of my best customers. I’ve sold him a hundred nesties, I’m\r\nsure. There’s a doctor at Dalston I sell a great number to--he’s taking\r\none of every kind of me now. The most of my customers is stray ones in\r\nthe streets. They’re generally boys. I sells a nest now and then to a\r\nlady with a child; but the boys of twelve to fifteen years of age is my\r\nbest friends. They buy ’em only for cur’osity. I sold three partridges’\r\neggs yesterday to a gentleman, and he said he would put them under a\r\nbantam he’d got, and hatch ’em.\r\n\r\n“The snakes, and adders, and slow-worms I get from where there’s moss\r\nor a deal of grass. Sunny weather’s the best for them, they won’t\r\ncome out when it’s cold; then I go to a dung-heap, and turn it over.\r\nSometimes, I find five or six there, but never so large as the one I\r\nhad to-day, that’s a yard and five inches long, and three-quarters of\r\na pound weight. Snakes is 5_s._ a pound. I sell all I can get to Mr.\r\nButler, of Covent-garden. He keeps ’em alive, for they’re no good dead.\r\nI think it’s for the skin they’re kept. Some buys ’em to dissect: a\r\ngentleman in Theobalds-road does so, and so he does hedgehogs. Some\r\nbuys ’em for stuffing, and others for cur’osities. Adders is the same\r\nprice as snakes, 5_s._ a pound after they first comes in, when they’re\r\n10_s._ Adders is wanted dead; it’s only the fat and skin that’s of any\r\nvalue; the fat is used for curing p’isoned wounds, and the skin is used\r\nfor any one as has cut their heads. Farmers buys the fat, and rubs it\r\ninto the wound when they gets bitten or stung by anything p’isonous.\r\nI kill the adders with a stick, or, when I has shoes, I jumps on ’em.\r\nSome fine days I get four or five snakes at a time; but then they’re\r\nmostly small, and won’t weigh above half a pound. I don’t get many\r\nadders--they don’t weigh many ounces, adders don’t--and I mostly has\r\n9_d._ a-piece for each I gets. I sells _them_ to Mr. Butler as well.\r\n\r\n“The hedgehogs is 1_s._ each; I gets them mostly in Essex. I’ve took\r\none hedgehog with three young ones, and sold the lot for 2_s._ 6_d._\r\nPeople in the streets bought them of me--they’re wanted to kill the\r\nblack-beetles; they’re fed on bread and milk, and they’ll suck a cow\r\nquite dry in their wild state. They eat adders, and can’t be p’isoned,\r\nat least it says so in a book I’ve got about ’em at home.\r\n\r\n“The effets I gets orders for in the streets. Gentlemen gives me their\r\ncards, and tells me to bring them one; they’re 2_d._ apiece. I get them\r\nat Hampstead and Highgate, from the ponds. They’re wanted for cur’osity.\r\n\r\n“The snails and frogs I sell to Frenchmen. I don’t know what part they\r\neat of the frog, but I know they buy them, and the dandelion root.\r\nThe frogs is 6_d._ and 1_s._ a dozen. They like the yellow-bellied\r\nones, the others they’re afraid is toads. They always pick out the\r\nyellow-bellied first; I don’t know how to feed ’em, or else I might\r\nfatten them. Many people swallows young frogs, they’re reckoned very\r\ngood things to clear the inside. The frogs I catch in ponds and ditches\r\nup at Hampstead and Highgate, but I only get them when I’ve a order.\r\nI’ve had a order for as many as six dozen, but that was for the French\r\nhotel in Leicester-square; but I _have_ sold three dozen a week to one\r\nman, a Frenchman, as keeps a cigar shop in R--r’s-court.\r\n\r\n“The snails I sell by the pailful--at 2_s._ 6_d._ the pail. There\r\nis some hundreds in a pail. The wet weather is the best times for\r\ncatching ’em; the French people eats ’em. They boils ’em first to get\r\n’em out of the shell and get rid of the green froth; then they boils\r\nthem again, and after that in vinegar. They eats ’em hot, but some of\r\nthe foreigners likes ’em cold. They say they’re better, if possible,\r\nthan whelks. I used to sell a great many to a lady and gentleman in\r\nSoho-square, and to many of the French I sell 1_s._’s worth, that’s\r\nabout three or four quarts. Some persons buys snails for birds, and\r\nsome to strengthen a sickly child’s back; they rub the back all over\r\nwith the snails, and a very good thing they tell me it is. I used to\r\ntake 2_s._’s worth a week to one woman; it’s the green froth that does\r\nthe greatest good. There are two more birds’-nest sellers besides\r\nmyself, they don’t do as many as me the two of ’em. They’re very naked,\r\ntheir things is all to ribbins; they only go into the country once\r\nin a fortnight. They was never nothing, no trade--they never was in\r\nplace--from what I’ve heard--either of them. I reckon I sell about\r\n20 nesties a week take one week with another, and that I do for four\r\nmonths in the year. (This altogether makes 320 nests.) Yes, I should\r\nsay, I do sell about 300 birds’-nests every year, and the other two,\r\nI’m sure, don’t sell half that. Indeed they don’t want to sell; they\r\ndoes better by what they gets give to them. I can’t say what they\r\ntakes, they’re Irish, and I never was in conversation with them. I\r\nget about 4_s._ to 5_s._ for the 20 nests, that’s between 2_d._ and\r\n3_d._ apiece. I sell about a couple of snakes every week, and for some\r\nof them I get 1_s._, and for the big ones 2_s._ 6_d._; but them _I_\r\nseldom find. I’ve only had three hedgehogs this season, and I’ve done\r\na little in snails and frogs, perhaps about 1_s._ The many foreigners\r\nin London this season hasn’t done me no good. I haven’t been to\r\nLeicester-square lately, or perhaps I might have got a large order or\r\ntwo for frogs.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF A BIRD’S-NEST SELLER.\r\n\r\n“I am 22 years of age. My father was a dyer, and I was brought up to\r\nthe same trade. My father lived at Arundel, in Sussex, and kept a shop\r\nthere. He had a good business as dyer, scourer, calico glazer, and\r\nfurniture cleaner. I have heard mother say his business in Arundel\r\nbrought him in 300_l._ a year at least. He had eight men in his employ,\r\nand none under 30_s._ a week. I had two brothers and one sister, but\r\none of my brothers is since dead. Mother died five years ago in the\r\nConsumption Hospital, at Chelsea, just after it was built. I was very\r\nyoung indeed when father died; I can hardly remember him. He died\r\nin Middlesex Hospital: he had abscesses all over him; there were\r\nsix-and-thirty at the time of his death. I’ve heard mother say many\r\ntimes that she thinked it was through exerting himself too much at his\r\nbusiness that he fell ill. The ruin of father was owing to his house\r\nbeing burnt down; the fire broke out at two in the morning; he wasn’t\r\ninsured: I don’t remember the fire; I’ve only heerd mother talk about\r\nit. It was the ruin of us all she used to tell me; father had so much\r\nwork belonging to other people; a deal of moreen curtains, five or six\r\nhundred yards. It was of no use his trying to start again: he lost\r\nall his glazing machines and tubs, and his drugs and ‘punches.’ From\r\nwhat I’ve heerd from mother they was worth some hundreds. The Duke of\r\nNorfolk, after the fire, gave a good lot of money to the poor people\r\nwhose things father had to clean, and father himself came up to London.\r\nI wasn’t two year old when that happened. We all come up with father,\r\nand he opened a shop in London and bought all new things. He had got\r\na bit of money left, and mother’s uncle lent him 60_l._ We lived two\r\ndoors from the stage door of the Queen’s Theatre, in Pitt-street,\r\nCharlotte-street, Fitzroy-square; but father didn’t do much in London;\r\nhe had a new connection to make, and when he died his things was sold\r\nfor the rent of the house. There was only money enough to bury him. I\r\ndon’t know how long ago that was, but I think it was about three years\r\nafter our coming to London, for I’ve heerd mother say I was six years\r\nold when father died. After father’s death mother borrowed some more\r\nmoney of her uncle, who was well to do. He was perfumer to her Majesty:\r\nhe’s dead now, and left the business to his foreman. The business was\r\nworth 2000_l._ His wife, my mother’s aunt, is alive still, and though\r\nshe’s a woman of large property, she won’t so much as look at me. She\r\nkeeps her carriage and two footmen; her address is, Mrs. Lewis, No. 10,\r\nPorchester-terrace, Bayswater. I have been in her drawing-room two or\r\nthree times. I used to take letters to her from mother: she was very\r\nkind to me then, and give me several half-crowns. She knows the state\r\nI am in now. A young man wrote a letter to her, saying I had no clothes\r\nto look after work in, and that I was near starving, but she sent no\r\nanswer to it. The last time I called at her house she sent me down\r\nnothing, and bid the servant tell me not to come any more. Ever since\r\nI’ve wanted it I’ve never had nothing from her, but before that she\r\nused to give me something whenever I took a letter from mother to her.\r\nThe last half-crown I got at her house was from the cook, who gave it\r\nme out of her own money because she’d known my mother.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a grandmother living in Woburn-place; she’s in service there,\r\nand been in the family for twenty years. The gentleman died lately and\r\nleft her half his property. He was a foreigner and had no relations\r\nhere. My grandmother used to be very good to me, and when I first got\r\nout of work she always gave me something when I called, and had me\r\ndown in her room. She was housekeeper then. She never offered to get\r\nme a situation, but only gave me a meal of victuals and a shilling or\r\neighteen-pence whenever I called. I was tidy in my dress then. At last\r\na new footman came, and he told me as I wasn’t to call again; he said,\r\nthe family didn’t allow no followers. I’ve never seen my grandmother\r\nsince that time but once, and then I was passing with my basket of\r\nbirds’ nests in my hand just as she was coming out of the door. I was\r\ndressed about the same then as you seed me yesterday. I was without a\r\nshirt to my back. I don’t think she saw me, and I was ashamed to let\r\nher see me as I was. She was kind enough to me, that is, she wouldn’t\r\nmind about giving me a shilling or so at a time, but she never would do\r\nnothing else for me, and yet she had got plenty of money in the bank,\r\nand a gold watch, and all, at her side.\r\n\r\n“After father died, as I was saying, mother got some money from her\r\nuncle and set up on her own account; she took in glazing for the trade.\r\nFather had a few shops that he worked for, and they employed mother\r\nafter his death. She kept on at this for eighteen months and then she\r\ngot married again. Before this an uncle of mine, my father’s brother,\r\nwho kept some lime-kilns down in Bury St. Edmunds, consented to take my\r\nbrother and sister and provide for them, and four or five year ago he\r\ngot them both into the Duke of Norfolk’s service, and there they are\r\nnow. They’ve never seen me since I was a child but once, and that was\r\na few year ago. I’ve never sent to them to say how badly I was off.\r\nThey’re younger than I am, and can only just take care of theirselves.\r\nWhen mother married again, her husband came to live at the house; he\r\nwas a dyer. He behaved very well to me. Mother wouldn’t send me down\r\nto uncle’s, she was too fond of me. I was sent to school for about\r\neighteen months, and after that I used to assist in the glazing at\r\nhome, and so I went on very comfortable for some time. Nine year ago\r\nI went to work at a French dyer’s, in Rathbone-place. My step-father\r\ngot me there, and there I stopped six year. I lived in the house after\r\nthe first eighteen months of my service. Five year ago mother fell\r\nill; she had been ailing many years, and she got admitted into the\r\nConsumption Hospital, at Brompton. She was there just upon three months\r\nand was coming out the next day (her term was up), when she died on the\r\nover night. After that my step-father altered very much towards me. He\r\ndidn’t want me at home at all. He told me so a fortnight after mother\r\nwas in her grave. He took to drinking very hearty directly she was\r\ngone. He would do anything for me before that. He used to take me with\r\nhim to every place of amusement what he went to, but when he took to\r\ndrinking he quite changed; then he got to beat me, and at last he told\r\nme I needn’t come there any more.\r\n\r\n“After that, I still kept working in Rathbone-place, and got a lodging\r\nof my own; I used to have 9_s._ a week where I was, and I paid 2_s._\r\na week for my bed, and washing, and mending. I had half a room with a\r\nman and his wife; I went on so for about two years, and then I was took\r\nbad with the scarlet fever and went to Gray’s-inn-lane hospital. After\r\nI was cured of the scarlet fever, I had the brain fever, and was near\r\nmy death; I was altogether eight weeks in the hospital, and when I come\r\nout I could get no work where I had been before. The master’s nephew\r\nhad come from Paris, and they had all French hands in the house. He\r\nwouldn’t employ an English hand at all. He give me a trifle of money,\r\nand told me he would pay my lodgings for a week or two while I looked\r\nfor work. I sought all about and couldn’t find any; this was about\r\nthree year ago. People wouldn’t have me because I didn’t know nothing\r\nabout the English mode of business. I couldn’t even tell the names\r\nof the English drugs, having been brought up in a French house. At\r\nlast, my master got tired of paying for my lodging, and I used to try\r\nand pick up a few pence in the streets by carrying boxes and holding\r\nhorses, it was all as I could get to do; I tried all I could to find\r\nemployment, and they was the only jobs I could get. But I couldn’t make\r\nenough for my lodging this way, and over and over again I’ve had to\r\nsleep out. Then I used to walk the streets most of the night, or lie\r\nabout in the markets till morning came in the hopes of getting a job.\r\nI’m a very little eater, and perhaps that’s the luckiest thing for such\r\nas me; half a pound of bread and a few potatoes will do me for the day.\r\nIf I could afford it, I used to get a ha’porth of coffee and a ha’porth\r\nof sugar, and make it do twice. Sometimes I used to have victuals give\r\nto me, sometimes I went without altogether; and sometimes I couldn’t\r\neat. I can’t always.\r\n\r\n“Six weeks after I had been knocking about in the streets in the\r\nmanner I’ve told you, a man I met in Covent-Garden market told me he\r\nwas going into the country to get some roots (it was in the winter\r\ntime and cold indeed; I was dressed about the same as I am now, only\r\nI had a pair of boots); and he said if I chose to go with him, he’d\r\ngive me half of whatever he earned. I went to Croydon and got some\r\nprimroses; my share came to 9_d._, and that was quite a God-send to me,\r\nafter getting nothing. Sometimes before that I’d been two days without\r\ntasting anything; and when I got some victuals after that, I couldn’t\r\ntouch them. All I felt was giddy; I wasn’t to say hungry, only weak and\r\nsicklified. I went with this man after the roots two or three times;\r\nhe took me to oblige me, and show me the way how to get a bit of food\r\nfor myself; after that, when I got to know all about it, I went to get\r\nroots on my own account. I never felt a wish to take nothing when I was\r\nvery hard up. Sometimes when I got cold and was tired, walking about\r\nand weak from not having had nothing to eat, I used to think I’d break\r\na window and take something out to get locked up; but I could never\r\nmake my mind up to it; they never hurt me, I’d say to myself. I do\r\nfancy though, if anybody had refused me a bit of bread, I should have\r\ndone something again them, but I couldn’t, do you see, in cold blood\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n“When the summer came round a gentleman whom I seed in the market asked\r\nme if I’d get him half a dozen nesties--he didn’t mind what they was,\r\nso long as they was small, and of different kinds--and as I’d come\r\nacross a many in my trips after the flowers, I told him I would do\r\nso--and that first put it into my head; and I’ve been doing that every\r\nsummer since then. It’s poor work, though, at the best. Often and often\r\nI have to walk 30 miles out without any victuals to take with me, or\r\nmoney to get any, and 30 miles again back, and bring with me about a\r\ndozen nesties; and, perhaps, if I’d no order for them, and was forced\r\nto sell them to the boys, I shouldn’t get more than a shilling for the\r\nlot after all. When the time comes round for it, I go Christmasing and\r\ngetting holly, but that’s more dangerous work than bird-nesting; the\r\nfarmers don’t mind your taking the nesties, as it prevents the young\r\nbirds from growing up and eating their corn. The greater part of the\r\nholly used in London for trimming up the churches and sticking in the\r\npuddings, is stolen by such as me, at the risk of getting six months\r\nfor it. The farmers brings a good lot to market, but we is obligated to\r\nsteal it. Take one week with another, I’m sure I don’t make above 5_s._\r\nYou can tell that to look at me. I don’t drink, and I don’t gamble;\r\nso you can judge how much I get when I’ve had to pawn my shirt for a\r\nmeal. All last week I only sold two nesties--they was a partridge’s\r\nand a yellow-hammer’s; for one I got 6_d._, and the other 3_d._, and\r\nI had been thirteen miles to get them. I got beside that a fourpenny\r\npiece for some chickweed which I’d been up to Highgate to gather for\r\na man with a bad leg (it’s the best thing there is for a poultice to\r\na wound), and then I earned another 4_d._ by some mash (marsh) mallow\r\nleaves (that there was to purify the blood of a poor woman): that, with\r\n4_d._ that a gentleman give to me, was all I got last week; 1_s._ 9_d._\r\nI think it is altogether. I had some victuals give to me in the street,\r\nor else I daresay I should have had to go without; but, as it was, I\r\ngave the money to the man and his wife I live with. You see they had\r\nnothing, and as they’re good to me when I want, why, I did what I could\r\nfor them. I’ve tried to get out of my present life, but there seems\r\nto be an ill luck again me. Sometimes I gets a good turn. A gentleman\r\ngives me an order, and then I saves a shilling or eighteenpence, so\r\nas to buy something with that I can sell again in the streets; but a\r\nwet day is sure to come, and then I’m cracked up, obligated to eat it\r\nall away. Once I got to sell fish. A gentleman give me a crown-piece\r\nin the street, and I borrowed a barrow at 2_d._ a day, and did pretty\r\nwell for a time. In three weeks I had saved 18_s._; then I got an order\r\nfor a sack of moss from one of the flower-sellers, and I went down to\r\nChelmsford, and stopped for the night in Lower Nelson-street, at the\r\nsign of “The Three Queens.” I had my money safe in my fob the night\r\nbefore, and a good pair of boots to my feet then; when I woke in the\r\nmorning my boots was gone, and on feeling in my fob my money was gone\r\ntoo. There was four beds in the rooms, feather and flock; the feather\r\nones was 4_d._, and the flock 3_d._ for a single one, and 2-1/2_d._\r\neach person for a double one. There was six people in the room that\r\nnight, and one of ’em was gone before I awoke--he was a cadger--and had\r\ntook my money with him. I complained to the landlord--they call him\r\nGeorge--but it was no good; all I could get was some victuals. So I’ve\r\nbeen obliged to keep to birds’-nesting ever since.\r\n\r\n“I’ve never been in prison but once. I was took up for begging.\r\nI was merely leaning again the railings of Tavistock-square with\r\nmy birds’-nesties in my hand, and the policemen took me off to\r\nClerkenwell, but the magistrates, instead of sending me to prison,\r\ngave me 2_s._ out of the poors’-box. I feel it very much going about\r\nwithout shoes or without shirt, and exposed to all weathers, and often\r\nout all night. The doctor at the hospital in Gray’s-inn-lane gave me\r\ntwo flannels, and told me that whatever I did I was to keep myself\r\nwrapped up; but what’s the use of saying that to such as me who is\r\nobligated to pawn the shirt off our back for food the first wet day as\r\ncomes? If you haven’t got money to pay for your bed at a lodging-house,\r\nyou must take the shirt off your back and leave it with them, or else\r\nthey’ll turn you out. I know many such. Sometimes I go to an artist.\r\nI had 5_s._ when I was drawed before the Queen. I wasn’t ’xactly\r\ndrawed before her, but my portrait was shown to her, and I was told\r\nthat if I’d be there I might receive a trifle. I was drawed as a gipsy\r\nfiddler. Mr. Oakley in Regent-street was the gentleman as did it. I\r\nwas dressed in some things he got for me. I had an Italian’s hat, one\r\nwith a broad brim and a peaked crown, a red plush waistcoat, and a\r\nyellow hankercher tied in a good many knots round my neck. I’d a black\r\nvelveteen Newmarket-cut coat, with very large pearl buttons, and a pair\r\nof black knee-breeches tied with fine red strings. Then I’d blue stripe\r\nstockings and high-ancle boots with very thin soles. I’d a fiddle in\r\none hand and a bow in the other. The gentleman said he drawed me for my\r\nhead of hair. I’ve never been a gipsy, but he told me he didn’t mind\r\nthat, for I should make as good a gipsy fiddler as the real thing. The\r\nartists mostly give me 2_s._ I’ve only been three times. I only wish\r\nI could get away from my present life. Indeed I would do any work if I\r\ncould get it. I’m sure I could have a good character from my masters in\r\nRathbone-place, for I never done nothing wrong. But if I couldn’t get\r\nwork I might very well, if I’d money enough, get a few flowers to sell.\r\nAs it is it’s more than any one can do to save at bird-nesting, and\r\nI’m sure I’m as prudent as e’er a one in the streets. I never took the\r\npledge, but still I never take no beer nor spirits--I never did. Mother\r\ntold me never to touch ’em, and I haven’t tasted a drop. I’ve often\r\nbeen in a public-house selling my things, and people has offered me\r\nsomething to drink, but I never touch any. I can’t tell why I dislike\r\ndoing so--but something seems to tell me not to taste such stuff. I\r\ndon’t know whether it’s what my mother said to me. I know I was very\r\nfond of her, but I don’t say it’s that altogether as makes me do it. I\r\ndon’t feel to want it. I smoke a good bit, and would sooner have a bit\r\nof baccy than a meal at any time. I could get a goodish rig-out in the\r\nlane for a few shillings. A pair of boots would cost me 2_s._, and a\r\ncoat I could get for 2_s._ 6_d._ I go to a ragged school three times a\r\nweek if I can, for I’m but a poor scholar still, and I should like to\r\nknow how to read; it’s always handy you know, sir.”\r\n\r\nThis lad has been supplied with a suit of clothes and sufficient money\r\nto start him in some of the better kind of street-trades. It was\r\nthought advisable not to put him to any more _settled_ occupation on\r\naccount of the vagrant habits he has necessarily acquired during his\r\nbird-nesting career. Before doing this he was employed as errand-boy\r\nfor a week, with the object of testing his trustworthiness, and\r\nwas found both honest and attentive. He appears a prudent lad, but\r\nof course it is difficult, as yet, to speak positively as to his\r\ncharacter. He has, however, been assured that if he shows a disposition\r\nto follow some more reputable calling he shall at least be put in the\r\nway of so doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SQUIRRELS.\r\n\r\nThe street squirrel-sellers are generally the same men as are engaged\r\nin the open-air traffic in cage-birds. There are, however, about six\r\nmen who devote themselves more particularly to squirrel-selling, while\r\nas many more sometimes “take a turn at it.” The squirrel is usually\r\ncarried in the vendor’s arms, or is held against the front of his coat,\r\nso that the animal’s long bushy tail is seen to advantage. There is\r\nusually a red leather collar round its neck, to which is attached some\r\nslender string, but so contrived that the squirrel shall not appear\r\nto be a prisoner, nor in general--although perhaps the hawker became\r\npossessed of his squirrel only that morning--does the animal show any\r\nsymptoms of fear.\r\n\r\nThe chief places in which squirrels are offered for sale, are\r\nRegent-street and the Royal Exchange, but they are offered also in\r\nall the principal thoroughfares--especially at the West End. The\r\npurchasers are gentlefolk, tradespeople, and a few of the working\r\nclasses who are fond of animals. The wealthier persons usually buy the\r\nsquirrels for their children, and, even after the free life of the\r\nwoods, the animal seems happy enough in the revolving cage, in which it\r\n“thinks it climbs.”\r\n\r\nThe prices charged are from 2_s._ to 5_s._, “or more if it can be got,”\r\nfrom a third to a half being profit. The sellers will oft enough state,\r\nif questioned, that they caught the squirrels in Epping Forest, or Caen\r\nWood, or any place sufficiently near London, but such is hardly ever\r\nthe case, for the squirrels are bought by them of the dealers in live\r\nanimals. Countrymen will sometimes catch a few squirrels and bring them\r\nto London, and nine times out of ten they sell them to the shopkeepers.\r\nTo sell three squirrels a day in the street is accounted good work.\r\n\r\nI am assured by the best-informed parties that for five months of the\r\nyear there are 20 men selling squirrels in the streets, at from 20 to\r\n50 per cent. profit, and that they average a weekly sale of six each.\r\nThe average price is from 2_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._, although not very long\r\nago one man sold a “wonderfully fine squirrel” in the street for three\r\nhalf-crowns, but they are sometimes parted with for 1_s._ 6_d._ or\r\nless, rather than be kept over-night. Thus 2400 squirrels are vended\r\nyearly in the streets, at a cost to the public of 240_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF LEVERETS, WILD RABBITS, ETC.\r\n\r\nThere are a few leverets, or young hares, sold in the streets, and\r\nthey are vended for the most part in the suburbs, where the houses\r\nare somewhat detached, and where there are plenty of gardens. The\r\nsoftness and gentleness of the leveret’s look pleases children, more\r\nespecially girls, I am informed, and it is usually through their\r\nimportunity that the young hares are bought, in order that they may be\r\nfed from the garden, and run tame about an out-house. The leverets thus\r\nsold, however, as regards nine out of ten, soon die. They are rarely\r\nsupplied with their natural food, and all their natural habits are\r\ninterrupted. They are in constant fear and danger, moreover, from both\r\ndogs and cats. One shopkeeper who sold fancy rabbits in a street off\r\nthe Westminster-road told me that he had once tried to tame and rear\r\nleverets in hutches, as he did rabbits, but to no purpose. He had no\r\ndoubt it might be done, he said, but not in a shop or a small house.\r\nThree or four leverets are hawked by the street-people in one basket\r\nand are seen lying on hay, the basket having either a wide-worked lid,\r\nor a net thrown over it. The hawkers of live poultry sell the most\r\nleverets, but they are vended also by the singing-bird sellers. The\r\nanimals are nearly all bought, for this traffic, at Leadenhall, and are\r\nretailed at 1_s._ to 2_s._ each, one-third to one-half being profit.\r\nPerhaps 300 are sold this way yearly, producing 22_l._ 10_s._\r\n\r\nAbout 400 young wild rabbits are sold in the street in a similar way,\r\nbut at lower sums, from 3_d._ to 6_d._ each, 4_d._ being the most\r\nfrequent rate. The yearly outlay is thus 6_l._ 13_s._ They thrive, in\r\nconfinement, no better than the leverets.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF GOLD AND SILVER FISH.\r\n\r\nOf these dealers, residents in London, there are about 70; but during\r\nmy inquiry (at the beginning of July) there were not 20 in town. One of\r\ntheir body knew of ten who were at work live-fish selling, and there\r\nmight be as many more, he thought, “working” the remoter suburbs of\r\nBlackheath, Croydon, Richmond, Twickenham, Isleworth, or wherever there\r\nare villa residences of the wealthy. This is the season when the gold\r\nand silver fish-sellers, who are altogether a distinct class from the\r\nbird-sellers of the streets, resort to the country, to vend their glass\r\nglobes, with the glittering fish swimming ceaselessly round and round.\r\nThe gold fish-hawkers are, for the most part, of the very best class of\r\nthe street-sellers. One of the principal fish-sellers is in winter a\r\nstreet-vendor of cough drops, hore-hound candy, coltsfoot-sticks, and\r\nother medicinal confectionaries, which he himself manufactures. Another\r\nleading gold-fish seller is a costermonger now “on pine-apples.” A\r\nthird, “with a good connection among the innkeepers,” is in the autumn\r\nand winter a hawker of game and poultry.\r\n\r\nThere are in London three wholesale dealers in gold and silver\r\nfish; two of whom--one in the Kingsland-road and the other close by\r\nBillingsgate--supply more especially the street-sellers, and the\r\nstreet-traffic is considerable. Gold fish is one of the things which\r\npeople buy when brought to their doors, but which they seldom care to\r\n“order.” The importunity of children when a man unexpectedly tempts\r\nthem with a display of such brilliant creatures as gold fish, is\r\nanother great promotive of the street-trade; and the street-traders are\r\nthe best customers of the wholesale purveyors, buying somewhere about\r\nthree-fourths of their whole stock. The dealers keep their fish in\r\ntanks suited to the purpose, but goldfish are never bred in London. The\r\nEnglish-reared gold fish are “raised” for the most part, as respects\r\nthe London market, in several places in Essex. In some parts they are\r\nbred in warm ponds, the water being heated by the steam from adjacent\r\nmachinery, and in some places they are found to thrive well. Some are\r\nimported from France, Holland, and Belgium; some are brought from the\r\nIndies, and are usually sold to the dealers to improve their breed,\r\nwhich every now and then, I was told, “required a foreign mixture,\r\nor they didn’t keep up their colour.” The Indian and foreign fish,\r\nhowever, are also sold in the streets; the dealers, or rather the\r\nEssex breeders, who are often in London, have “just the pick of them,”\r\nusually through the agency of their town customers. The English-reared\r\ngold fish are not much short of three-fourths of the whole supply, as\r\nthe importation of these fishes is troublesome; and unless they are\r\nsent under the care of a competent person, or unless the master or\r\nsteward of a vessel is made to incur a share in the venture, by being\r\npaid so much freight-money for as many gold and silver fishes as are\r\nlanded in good health, and nothing for the dead or dying, it is very\r\nhazardous sending them on shipboard at all, as in case of neglect they\r\nmay all die during the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe gold and silver fish are of the carp species, and are natives of\r\nChina, but they were first introduced into this country from Portugal\r\nabout 1690. Some are still brought from Portugal. They have been common\r\nin England for about 120 years.\r\n\r\nThese fish are known in the street-trade as “globe” and “pond” fish.\r\nThe distinction is not one of species, nor even of the “variety” of a\r\nspecies, but merely a distinction of size. The larger fish are “pond;”\r\nthe smaller, “globe.” But the difference on which the street-sellers\r\nprincipally dwell is that the pond fish are far more troublesome to\r\nkeep by them in a “slack time,” as they must be fed and tended most\r\nsedulously. Their food is stale bread or biscuit. The “globe” fish\r\nare not fed at all by the street-dealer, as the animalcules and the\r\nminute insects in the water suffice for their food. Soft, rain, or\r\nsometimes Thames water, is used for the filling of the globe containing\r\na street-seller’s gold fish, the water being changed twice a day, at a\r\npublic-house or elsewhere, when the hawker is on a round. Spring-water\r\nis usually rejected, as the soft water contains “more feed.” One man,\r\nhowever, told me he had recourse to the street-pumps for a renewal\r\nof water, twice, or occasionally thrice a day, when the weather was\r\nsultry; but spring or well water “wouldn’t do at all.” He was quite\r\nunconscious that he was using it from the pump.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale price of these fish ranges from 5_s._ to 18_s._ per\r\ndozen, with a higher charge for “picked fish,” when high prices must\r\nbe paid. The cost of “large silvers,” for instance, which are scarcer\r\nthan “large golds,” so I heard them called, is sometimes 5_s._ apiece,\r\neven to a retailer, and rarely less than 3_s._ 6_d._ The most frequent\r\nprice, retail from the hawker--for almost all the fish are hawked, but\r\nonly there, I presume, for a temporary purpose--is 2_s._ the pair. The\r\ngold fish are now always hawked in glass globes, containing about a\r\ndozen occupants, within a diameter of twelve inches. These globes are\r\nsold by the hawker, or, if ordered, supplied by him on his next round\r\nthat way, the price being about 2_s._ Glass globes, for the display\r\nof gold fish, are indeed manufactured at from 6_d._ to 1_l._ 10_s._\r\neach, but 2_s._ or 2_s._ 6_d._ is the usual limit to the price of\r\nthose vended in the street. The fish are lifted out of the water in\r\nthe globe to consign to a purchaser, by being caught in a neat net,\r\nof fine and different-coloured cordage, always carried by the hawker,\r\nand manufactured for the trade at 2_s._ the dozen. Neat handles for\r\nthese nets, of stained or plain wood, are 1_s._ the dozen. The dealers\r\navoid touching the fish with their hands. Both gold fish and glass\r\nglobes are much cheaper than they were ten years ago; the globes are\r\ncheaper, of course, since the alteration in the tax on glass, and the\r\nstreet-sellers are, numerically, nearly double what they were.\r\n\r\nFrom a well-looking and well-spoken youth of 21 or 22, I had the\r\nfollowing account. He was the son, and grandson, of costermongers, but\r\nwas--perhaps, in consequence of his gold-fish selling lying among a\r\nclass not usually the costermongers’ customers--of more refined manners\r\nthan the generality of the costers’ children.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in the streets, sir,” he said, “helping my father, until I\r\nwas old enough to sell on my own account, since I was six years old.\r\n_Yes, I like a street life, I’ll tell you the plain truth, for I was\r\nput by my father to a paperstainer, and found I couldn’t bear to stay\r\nin doors. It would have killed me._ Gold fish are as good a thing to\r\nsell as anything else, perhaps, but I’ve been a costermonger as well,\r\nand have sold both fruit and good fish--salmon and fine soles. Gold\r\nfish are not good for eating. I tried one once, just out of curiosity,\r\nand it tasted very bitter indeed; I tasted it boiled. I’ve worked both\r\ntown and country on gold fish. I’ve served both Brighton and Hastings.\r\nThe fish were sent to me by rail, in vessels with air-holes, when I\r\nwanted more. I never stopped at lodging-houses, but at respectable\r\npublic-houses, where I could be well suited in the care of my fish.\r\nIt’s an expense, but there’s no help for it.” [A costermonger, when\r\nI questioned him on the subject, told me that he had sometimes sold\r\ngold fish in the country, and though he had often enough slept in\r\ncommon lodging-houses, he never could carry his fish there, for he\r\nfelt satisfied, although he had never tested the fact, that in nine\r\nout of ten such places, the fish, in the summer season, would half of\r\nthem die during the night from the foul air.] “Gold fish sell better\r\nin the country than town,” the street-dealer continued; “much better.\r\nThey’re more thought of in the country. My father’s sold them all over\r\nthe world, as the saying is. I’ve sold both foreign and English fish. I\r\nprefer English. They’re the hardiest; Essex fish. The foreign--I don’t\r\njust know what part--are bred in milk ponds; kept fresh and sweet,\r\nof course; and when they’re brought here, and come to be put in cold\r\nwater, they soon die. In Essex they’re bred in cold water. They live\r\nabout three years; that’s their lifetime if they’re properly seen to. I\r\ndon’t know what kind of fish gold fish are. I’ve heard that they first\r\ncame from China. No, I can’t read, and I’m very sorry for it. If I have\r\ntime next winter I’ll get taught. Gentlemen sometimes ask me to sit\r\ndown, and talk to me about fish, and their history (natural history),\r\nand I’m often at a loss, which I mightn’t be if I could read. If I\r\nhave fish left after my day’s work, I never let them stay in the globe\r\nI’ve hawked them in, but put them into a large pan, a tub sometimes,\r\nthree-parts full of water, where they have room. My customers are\r\nladies and gentlemen, but I have sold to shopkeepers, such as\r\nbuttermen, that often show gold fish and flowers in their shops. The\r\nfish don’t live long in the very small globes, but they’re put in them\r\nsometimes just to satisfy children. I’ve sold as many as two dozen at\r\na time to stock a pond in a gentleman’s garden. It’s the best sale a\r\nlittle way out of town, in any direction. I sell six dozen a week, I\r\nthink, one week with another; they’ll run as to price at 1_s._ apiece.\r\nThat six dozen includes what I sell both in town and country. Perhaps I\r\nsell them nearly three-parts of the year. Some hawk all the year, but\r\nit’s a poor winter trade. Yes, I make a very fair living; 2_s._ 6_d._\r\nor 3_s._ or so, a day, perhaps, on gold fish, when the weather suits.”\r\n\r\nA man, to whom I was referred as an experienced gold fish-seller,\r\nhad just returned, when I saw him, from the sale of a stock of new\r\npotatoes, peas, &c., which he “worked” in a donkey cart. He had not\r\nthis season, he said, started in the gold-fish line, and did very\r\nlittle last year in it, as his costermongering trade kept steady, but\r\nhis wife thought gold fish-selling was a better trade, and she always\r\naccompanied him in his street rounds; so he might take to it again. In\r\nhis youth he was in the service of an old lady who had several pets,\r\nand among them were gold fish, of which she was very proud, always\r\nendeavouring to procure the finest, a street-seller being sure of her\r\nas a customer if he had fish larger or deeper or brighter-coloured than\r\nusual. She kept them both in stone cisterns, or small ponds, in her\r\ngarden, and in glass globes in the house. Of these fish my informant\r\nhad the care, and was often commended for his good management of them.\r\nAfter his mistress’s death he was very unlucky, he said, in his places.\r\nHis last master having been implicated, he believed, in some gambling\r\nand bill-discounting transactions, left the kingdom suddenly, and my\r\ninformant was without a character, for the master he served previously\r\nto the one who went off so abruptly was dead, and a character two\r\nyears back was of no use, for people said, “But where have you been\r\nliving since? Let me know all about that.” The man did not know what to\r\ndo, for his money was soon exhausted: “I had nothing left,” he said,\r\n“which I could turn into money except a very good great coat, which had\r\nbelonged to my last master, and which was given to me because he went\r\noff without paying me my wages. I thought of ’listing, for I was tired\r\nof a footman’s life, _almost always in the house in such places as I\r\nhad_, but I was too old, I feared, and if I could have got over that\r\nI knew I should be rejected because I was getting bald. I was sitting\r\nthinking whatever could be done--I wasn’t married then--and had nobody\r\nto consult with; when I heard the very man as used to serve my old\r\nlady crying gold fish in the street. It struck me all of a heap, and I\r\nwonder I hadn’t thought of it before, when I recollected how well I’d\r\nmanaged the fish, that I’d sell gold fish too, and hawk it as he did,\r\nas it didn’t seem such a bad trade. So I asked the man all about it,\r\nand he told me, and I raised a sovereign on my great coat, and that was\r\nmy start in the streets. I was nervous, and a little ’shamed at first,\r\nbut I soon got over that, and in time turned my hand to fruit and other\r\nthings. Gold fish saved my life, sir; I do believe that, for I might\r\nhave pined into a consumption if I’d been without something to do, and\r\nsomething to eat much longer.”\r\n\r\nIf we calculate, in order to allow for the cessation of the trade\r\nduring the winter, and often in the summer when costermongering is\r\nat its best, that but half the above-mentioned number of gold-fish\r\nsellers hawk in the streets and that for but half a year, each selling\r\nsix dozen weekly at 12_s._ the dozen, we find 65,520 fish sold, at\r\nan outlay of 3276_l._ As the country is also “worked” by the London\r\nstreet-sellers, and the supply is derived from London, the number and\r\namount may be doubled to include this traffic, or 131,040 fish sold,\r\nand 6552_l._ expended.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF TORTOISES.\r\n\r\nThe number of tortoises sold in the streets of London is far greater\r\nthan might be imagined, for it is a creature of no utility, and one\r\nwhich is inanimate in this country for half its life.\r\n\r\nOf live tortoises, there are 20,000 annually imported from the port of\r\nMogadore in Morocco. They are not brought over, as are the parrots,\r\n&c., of which I have spoken, for amusement or as private ventures of\r\nthe seamen, but are regularly consigned from Jewish houses in Mogadore,\r\nto Jewish merchants in London. They are a freight of which little care\r\nis taken, as they are brought over principally as ballast in the ship’s\r\nhold, where they remain torpid.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers of tortoises are costermongers of the smarter\r\nclass. Sometimes the vendors of shells and foreign birds “work” also\r\na few tortoises, and occasionally a wholesale dealer (the consignee\r\nof the Jewish house in Africa) will send out his own servants to sell\r\nbarrow-loads of tortoises in the street on his own account. They are\r\nregularly ranged on the barrows, and certainly present a curious\r\nappearance--half-alive creatures as they are (when the weather is not\r\nof the warmest), brought from another continent for sale by thousands\r\nin the streets of London, and retention in the gardens and grounds of\r\nour civic villas. Of the number imported, one-half, or 10,000, are\r\nyearly sold in the streets by the several open-air dealers I have\r\nmentioned. The wholesale price is from 4_s._ to 6_s._ the dozen; they\r\nare retailed from 6_d._ to 1_s._, a very fine well-grown tortoise being\r\nsometimes worth 2_s._ 6_d._ The mass, however, are sold at 6_d._ to\r\n9_d._ each, but many fetch 1_s._ They are bought for children, and\r\nto keep in gardens as I have said, and when properly fed on lettuce\r\nleaves, spinach, and similar vegetables, or on white bread sopped in\r\nwater, will live a long time. If the tortoise be neglected in a garden,\r\nand have no access to his favourite food, he will eat almost any\r\ngreen thing which comes in his way, and so may commit ravages. During\r\nthe winter, and the later autumn and earlier spring, the tortoise is\r\ntorpid, and may be kept in a drawer or any recess, until the approach\r\nof summer “thaws” him, as I heard it called.\r\n\r\nCalculating the average price of tortoises in street-sale at 8_d._\r\neach, we find upwards of 333_l._ thus expended yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SNAILS, FROGS, WORMS, SNAKES, HEDGEHOGS, ETC.\r\n\r\nI class together these several kinds of live creatures, as they are\r\nall “gathered” and sold by the same persons--principally by the men\r\nwho supply bird-food, of whom I have given accounts in my statements\r\nconcerning groundsel, chickweed, plaintain, and turf-selling.\r\n\r\nThe principal _snail-sellers_, however, are the turf-cutters, who are\r\nyoung and active men, while the groundsel-sellers are often old and\r\ninfirm and incapable of working all night, as the necessities of the\r\nsnail-trade often require. Of turf-cutters there were, at the time of\r\nmy inquiry last winter, 42 in London, and of these full one-third are\r\nregular purveyors of snails, such being the daintier diet of the caged\r\nblackbirds and thrushes. These men obtain their supply of snails in the\r\nmarket-gardens, the proprietors willingly granting leave to any known\r\nor duly recommended person who will rid them of these depredators.\r\nSeven-eighths of the quantity gathered are sold to the bird-dealers, to\r\nwhom the price is 2_d._ a quart. The other eighth is sold on a street\r\nround at from 3_d._ to 6_d._ the quart. A quart contains at least 80\r\nsnails, not heaped up, their shells being measured along with them. One\r\nman told me there were “100 snails to a fair quart.”\r\n\r\nWhen it is moonlight at this season of the year, the snail gatherers\r\nsometimes work all night; at other times from an hour before sunset to\r\nthe decline of daylight, the work being resumed at the dawn. To gather\r\n12 quarts in a night, or a long evening and morning, is accounted a\r\nprosperous harvest. Half that quantity is “pretty tidy.” An experienced\r\nman said to me:--\r\n\r\n“The best snail grounds, sir, you may take my word for it, is in Putney\r\nand Barnes. It’s the ‘greys’ we go for, the fellows with the shells\r\non ’em; the black snails or slugs is no good to us. I think snails is\r\nthe slowest got money of any. I don’t suppose they get’s scarcer, but\r\nthere’s good seasons for snails and there’s bad. Warm and wet is best.\r\nWe don’t take the little ’uns. They come next year. I may make 1_l._ a\r\nyear, or a little more, in snails. In winter there’s hardly anything\r\ndone in them, and the snails is on the ground; in summer they’re on the\r\nwalls or leaves. They’ll keep six months without injury; they’ll keep\r\nthe winter round indeed in a proper place.”\r\n\r\nI am informed that the 14 snail gatherers on the average gather six\r\ndozen quarts each in a year, which supplies a total of 12,096 quarts,\r\nor individually, 1,189,440 snails. The labourers in the gardens, I am\r\ninformed, may gather somewhat more than an equal quantity,--all being\r\nsold to the bird-shops; so that altogether the supply of snails for the\r\ncaged thrushes and blackbirds of London is about two millions and a\r\nhalf. Computing them at 24,000 quarts, and only at 2_d._ a quart, the\r\noutlay is 200_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nThe _Frogs_ sold by street-people are, at the rate of about 36 dozen\r\na year, disposed of in equal proportion to University and King’s\r\nColleges. Only two men collect the frogs, one for each hospital.\r\nThey are charged 1_d._ each:--“I’ve sometimes,” said one of the\r\nfrog-purveyors, “come on a place where I could have got six or seven\r\ndozen in a day, but that’s mostly been when I didn’t want them. At\r\nother times I’ve gone days without collaring a single frog. I only want\r\nthem four times a year, and four or five dozen at a time. The low part\r\nof Hampstead’s the best ground for them, I think. The doctors like\r\nbig fellows. They keep them in water ’til they’re wanted to dissect.”\r\nOne man thought that there might be 50 more frogs or upwards ordered\r\nyearly, through the bird-shops, for experiments under air-pumps, &c.\r\nThis gives about 500 frogs sold yearly by the street-people. One year,\r\nhowever, I was told, the supply was larger, for a Camberwell gentleman\r\nordered 40 frogs to stock a watery place at the foot of his garden, as\r\nhe liked to hear and see them.\r\n\r\nThe _Toad_ trade is almost a nonentity. One man, who was confident\r\nhe had as good a trade in that line as any of his fellows, told me\r\nthat last year he only supplied one toad; in one year, he forgot the\r\nprecise time, he collected ten. He was confident that from 12 to 24 a\r\nyear was now the extent of the toad trade, perhaps 20. There was no\r\nregular price, and the men only “work to order.” “It’s just what the\r\nshopkeeper, mostly a herbalist, likes to give.” I was told, from 1_d._\r\nto 6_d._ according to size. “I don’t know what they’re wanted for,\r\nsomething about the doctors, I believe. But if you want any toads, sir,\r\nfor anything, I know a place between Hampstead and Willesden, where\r\nthere’s real stunners.”\r\n\r\n_Worms_ are collected in small quantities by the street-sellers, and\r\nvery grudgingly, for they are to be supplied gratuitously to the\r\nshopkeepers who are the customers of the turf-cutters, and snail and\r\nworm collectors. “They expects it as a parquisite, like.” One man told\r\nme that they only gathered ground worms for the bird-fanciers.\r\n\r\nOf the _Snakes_ and _Hedgehogs_ I have already spoken, when treating of\r\nthe collection of birds’-nests. I am told that some few _glow-worms_\r\nare collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF MINERAL PRODUCTIONS AND NATURAL CURIOSITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe class of which I have now to treat, including as it does the\r\nstreet-sellers of coal, coke, tan-turf, salt, and sand, seem to have\r\nbeen called into existence principally by the necessities of the\r\npoorer classes. As the earnings of thousands of men, in all the slop,\r\n“slaughter-house,” or “scamping” branches of tailoring, shoe-making,\r\ncabinet-making, joining, &c. have become lower and lower, they are\r\ncompelled to purchase the indispensable articles of daily consumption\r\nin the smallest quantities, and at irregular times, just as the\r\nmoney is in their possession. This is more especially the case as\r\nregards chamber-masters and garret-masters (among the shoemakers)\r\nand cabinet-makers, who, as they are small masters, and working on\r\ntheir own account, have not even such a regularity of payment as the\r\njourneyman of the slop-tailor. Among these poor artizans, moreover,\r\nthe wife must slave with the husband, and it is often an object with\r\nthem to save the time lost in going out to the chandler’s-shop or the\r\ncoal-shed, to have such things as coal, and coke brought to their very\r\ndoors, and vended in the smallest quantities. It is the same with the\r\nwomen who work for the slop-shirt merchants, &c., or make cap-fronts,\r\n&c., on their own account, for the supply of the shopkeepers, or the\r\nwholesale swag-men, who sell low-priced millinery. The street-sellers\r\nof the class I have now to notice are, then, the principal purveyors of\r\nthe very poor.\r\n\r\nThe men engaged in the street-sale of coal and coke--the chief articles\r\nof this branch of the street-sale--are of the costermonger class,\r\nas, indeed, is usually the case where an exercise of bodily strength\r\nis requisite. Costermongers, too, are better versed than any other\r\nstreet-folk in the management of barrows, carts, asses, ponies, or\r\nhorses, so that when these vehicles and these animals are a necessary\r\npart of any open-air business, it will generally be found in the hands\r\nof the coster class.\r\n\r\nNor is this branch of the street-traffic confined solely to articles of\r\nnecessity. Under my present enumeration will be found the street-sale\r\nof _shells_, an ornament of the mantel-piece above the fire-grate to\r\nwhich coal is a necessity.\r\n\r\nThe present division will complete the subject of Street _Sale_ in the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF COALS.\r\n\r\nAccording to the returns of the coal market for the last few years,\r\nthere has been imported into London, on an average, 3,500,000 tons\r\nof sea-borne coal annually. Besides this immense supply, the various\r\nrailways have lately poured in a continuous stream of the same\r\ncommodity from the inland districts, which has found a ready sale\r\nwithout sensibly affecting the accustomed vend of the north country\r\ncoals, long established on the Coal Exchange.\r\n\r\nTo the very poor the importance of coal can be scarcely estimated.\r\nPhysiological and medical writers tell us that carbonaceous food is\r\nthat which produces heat in the body, and is therefore the fuel of the\r\nsystem. Experience tells us that this is true; for who that has had\r\nan opportunity of visiting the habitations of the poor--the dwellers\r\nin ill-furnished rooms and garrets--has not remarked the more than\r\nhalf-starved slop needle-woman, the wretched half-naked children of the\r\ncasually employed labourer, as the dock-man, or those whose earnings\r\nare extorted from them by their employers, such as the ballast-man,\r\nsitting crouched around the smouldering embers in the place where the\r\nfire ought to be? The reason of this is, because the system of the\r\nsufferer by long want of food has been deprived of the necessary\r\ninternal heat, and so seeks instinctively to supply the deficiency by\r\nimbibing it from some outward source. It is on this account chiefly,\r\nI believe, that I have found the ill-paid and ill-fed workpeople\r\nprize warmth almost more than food. Among the poorest Irish, I have\r\ninvariably found them crowding round the wretched fire when they had\r\nnothing to eat.\r\n\r\nThe census returns of the present year (according to the accounts\r\npublished in the newspapers) estimate the number of the inhabitants of\r\nLondon at 2,363,141, and the number of inhabited houses as 307,722.\r\nNow if we take into consideration that in the immense suburbs of\r\nthe metropolis, there are branching off from almost every street,\r\nlabyrinths of courts and alleys, teeming with human beings, and that\r\nalmost every room has its separate family--for it takes a multitude of\r\npoor to make one rich man--we may be able to arrive at the conclusion\r\nthat by far the greater proportion of coals brought into London are\r\nconsumed by the poorer classes. It is on this account of the highest\r\nimportance, that honesty should be the characteristic of those engaged\r\nin the vend and distribution of an article so necessary not only to the\r\ncomfort but to the very existence of the great masses of the population.\r\n\r\nThe modes in which the coals imported into London are distributed to\r\nthe various classes of consumers are worthy of observation, as they\r\nunmistakably exhibit not only the wealth of the few, but the poverty\r\nof the many. The inhabitants of Belgravia, the wealthy shopkeepers,\r\nand many others periodically see at their doors the well-loaded waggon\r\nof the coal merchant, with two or three swarthy “coal-porters” bending\r\nbeneath the black heavy sacks, in the act of laying in the 10 or 20\r\ntons for yearly or half-yearly consumption. But this class is supplied\r\nfrom a very different quarter from that of the artizans, labourers, and\r\nmany others, who, being unable to spare money sufficient to lay in at\r\nonce a ton or two of coals, must have recourse to other means. To meet\r\ntheir limited resources, there may be found in every part, always in\r\nback streets, persons known as coal-shed men, who get the coals from\r\nthe merchant in 7, 14, or 20 tons at a time, and retail them from 1/4\r\ncwt. upwards. The coal-shed men are a very numerous class, for there is\r\nnot a low neighbourhood in any part of the city which contains not two\r\nor three of them in every street.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another class of purchasers of coals, however, which I\r\nhave called the ‘very poor,’--the inhabitants of two pairs back--the\r\ndwellers in garrets, &c. It seems to have been for the purpose of\r\nmeeting the wants of this class that the street-sellers of coals have\r\nsprung into existence. Those who know nothing of the decent pride which\r\noften lingers among the famishing poor, can scarcely be expected to\r\ncomprehend the great boon that the street-sellers of coals, if they\r\ncould only be made honest and conscientious dealers, are calculated\r\nto confer on these people. “I have seen,” says a correspondent, “the\r\nstarveling child of misery, in the gloom of the evening, steal timidly\r\ninto the shop of the coal-shed man, and in a tremulous voice ask, as if\r\nbegging a great favour, for _seven pound of coals_. The coal-shed man\r\nhas set down his pint of beer, taken the pipe from his mouth, blowing\r\nafter it a cloud of smoke, and in a gruff voice, at which the little\r\nwretch has shrunk up (if it were possible) into a less space than\r\nfamine had already reduced her to, and demanded--‘Who told you as how\r\nI sarves seven pound o’ coal?--Go to Bill C---- he may sarve you if he\r\nlikes--I won’t, and that’s an end on ’t--I wonders what people wants\r\nwith seven pound o’ coal.’ The coal-shed man, after delivering himself\r\nof this enlightened observation, has placidly resumed his pipe, while\r\nthe poor child, gliding out into the drizzling sleet, disappeared in\r\nthe darkness.”\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers vend any quantity at the very door of the purchaser,\r\nwithout rendering it necessary for them to expose their poverty to the\r\nprying eyes of the neighbourhood; and, as I have said were the street\r\ndealers only honest, they would be conferring a great boon upon the\r\npoorer portion of the people, but unhappily it is scarcely possible\r\nfor them to be so, and realize a profit for themselves. The police\r\nreports of the last year show that many of the coal merchants, standing\r\nhigh in the estimation of the world, have been heavily fined for using\r\nfalse weights; and, did the present inquiry admit of it, there might\r\nbe mentioned many other infamous practices by which the public are\r\nshamefully plundered in this commodity, and which go far to prove\r\nthat the coal trade, _in toto_, is a gigantic fraud. May I ask how it\r\nis possible for the street-sellers, with such examples of barefaced\r\ndishonesty before their eyes, even to dream of acting honestly? If\r\nnot actually certain, yet strongly suspecting, that they themselves\r\nare defrauded by the merchant, how can it be otherwise than that they\r\nshould resort to every possible mode of defrauding their customers, and\r\nso add to the already almost unendurable burdens of the poorest of the\r\npoor, who by one means or other are made to bear all the burdens of the\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nThe usual quantity of coals consumed in the poorest rooms, in which\r\na family resides, is 1/2 cwt. per week in summer, and 1 cwt. do. in\r\nwinter, or about 2 tons per annum.\r\n\r\nThe street sale of coals was carried on to a considerable extent during\r\nthe earlier part of the last century, “small coalmen” being among the\r\nregular street-traders. The best known of these was Tom Britton, who\r\ndied through fright occasioned by a practical joke. He was a great\r\nfosterer of a taste for music among the people; for, after hawking his\r\ncoals during the day, he had a musical gathering in his humble abode\r\nin the evening, to which many distinguished persons resorted. This is\r\nalluded to in the lines, by Hughes, under Tom Britton’s portrait, and\r\nthe allusion, according to the poetic fashion of the time being made by\r\nmeans of a strained classicality:--\r\n\r\n    “Cyllenius so, as fables tell, and Jove,\r\n    Came willing guests to poor Philemon’s grove.”\r\n\r\nThe trade seems to have disappeared gradually, but has recently been\r\nrevived in another form.\r\n\r\nSome few years ago an ingenious and enterprising costermonger, during\r\na “slack” in his own business, conceived the idea of purchasing some\r\nof the refuse of the coals at the wharfs, conveying them round the\r\npoorer localities of his beat, in his ass- or pony-cart, and vending\r\nthem to “room-keepers” and others, in small quantities and at a reduced\r\nrate, so as to undersell the coal-shed men, while making for himself a\r\nconsiderable profit. The example was not lost upon his fraternity, and\r\nno long time had elapsed before many others had started in the same\r\nline; this eventually took so much custom from the regular coal-shed\r\nmen, that, as a matter of self-defence, those among them who had a\r\nhorse and cart, found it necessary to compete with the originators of\r\nthe system in their own way, and, being possessed of more ample means,\r\nthey succeeded, in a great measure, in driving the costers out of the\r\nfield. The success of the coal-shed men was for a time so well followed\r\nup, that they began by degrees to edge away from the lanes and alleys,\r\nextending their excursions into quarters somewhat more aristocratic,\r\nand even there establishing a trade amongst those who had previously\r\ntaken their ton or half ton of coals from the “brass-plate merchant,”\r\nas he is called in the trade, being a person who merely procures orders\r\nfor coals, gets some merchant who buys in the coal market to execute\r\nthem in his name, and manages to make a living by the profits of these\r\ntransactions. Some of this latter class consequently found themselves\r\ncompelled to adopt a mode of doing their business somewhat similar, and\r\nfor that purpose hired vans from the proprietors of those vehicles,\r\nloaded them with sacks of coals, drove round among their customers,\r\nprepared to furnish them with sacks or half sacks, as they felt\r\ndisposed. Finally, many of the van proprietors themselves, finding that\r\nbusiness might be done in this way, started in the line, and, being in\r\ngeneral men of some means, established it as a regular trade. The van\r\nproprietors at the present time do the greater part of the business,\r\nbut there may occasionally be seen, employed in this traffic, all sorts\r\nof conveyances, from the donkey-cart of the costermonger, or dock\r\nlabourer, the latter of whom endeavours to make up for the miserable\r\npittance he can earn at the rate of fourpence per hour, by the profits\r\nof this calling, to the aristocratic van, drawn along by two plump,\r\nwell-fed horses, the property of a man worth 800_l._ or 900_l._\r\n\r\nThe van of the street-seller of coals is easily distinguished from\r\nthe waggon of the regular merchant. The merchant’s waggon is always\r\nloaded with sacks standing perpendicularly; it is drawn by four\r\nimmense horses, and is driven along by a gaunt figure, begrimed with\r\ncoal-dust, and “sporting” ancle boots, or shoes and gaiters, white, or\r\nwhat ought to be white, stockings, velvet knee-breeches, short tarry\r\nsmock-frock, and a huge fantail hat slouching half-way down his back.\r\nThe street-seller’s vehicle, on the contrary, has the coals shot into\r\nit without sacks; while, on a tailboard, extending behind, lie weights\r\nand scales. It is most frequently drawn by one horse, but sometimes\r\nby two, with bells above their collars jingling as they go, or else\r\nthe driver at intervals rings a bell like a dustman’s, to announce his\r\napproach to the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers formerly purchased their coals from any of the\r\nmerchants along the river-side; generally the refuse, or what remained\r\nafter the best had been picked out by “skreening” or otherwise; but\r\nalways taking a third or fourth quality as most suitable for their\r\npurpose. But since the erection of machinery for getting coals out\r\nof the ships in the Regent’s Canal basin, they have resorted to that\r\nplace, as the coals are at once shot from the box in which they are\r\nraised from the hold of the ship, into the cart or van, saving all the\r\ntrouble of being filled in sacks by coal porters, and carried on their\r\nbacks from the ship, barge, or heap, preparatory to their being emptied\r\ninto the van; thus getting them at a cheaper rate, and consequently\r\nbeing enabled to realize a greater profit.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of inland coals, also, by the railways, many of\r\nthe street-sellers have either wholly, or in part, taken to sell them\r\non account of the lower rate at which they can be purchased; sometimes\r\nthey vend them unmixed, but more frequently they mix them up with “the\r\nsmall” of north country coals of better quality, and palm off the\r\ncompound as “genuine Wallsend direct from the ship:” this (together\r\nwith short weights) being, in fact, the principal source of their\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that a merchant purchases in the market a cargo\r\nof coals which turns out to be damaged, very small, or of inferior\r\nquality. In such cases he usually refuses to take them, and it is\r\ndifficult to dispose of them in any regular way of trade. Such cargoes,\r\nor parts of cargoes, are consequently at times bought up by some of the\r\nmore wealthy van proprietors engaged in the coal line, who realize on\r\nthem a great profit.\r\n\r\nTo commence business as a street-seller of coals requires little\r\ncapital beyond the possession of a horse and cart. The merchants in\r\nall cases let street-sellers have any quantity of coals they may\r\nrequire till they are able to dispose of them; and the street-trade\r\nbeing a ready-money business, they can go on from day to day, or from\r\nweek to week, according to their pre-arrangements, so that, as far as\r\nthe commodity in which they deal is concerned, there is no outlay of\r\ncapital whatever.\r\n\r\n  There are about 30 two-horse vans continually\r\n  engaged in this trade, the price of each van\r\n  being 70_l._ This gives                         £2100\r\n    100 horses at 20_l._ each                      1200\r\n    160 carts at 10_l._ each                       1600\r\n    160 horses at 10_l._ each                      1600\r\n    20 donkey or pony carts, value 1_l._ each        20\r\n    20 donkeys or ponies at 1_l._ 10_s._ each        30\r\n\r\n  Making a total of 210 vehicles continually\r\n  employed, which, with the horses,                ----\r\n  &c., may be valued at                            6550\r\n\r\n  This sum, with the price of 210 sets\r\n  of weights and scales, at 1_l._ 10_s._ per set    315\r\n                                                   ----\r\n    Makes a total of                              £6865\r\n\r\nThis may be fairly set down as the gross amount of capital at present\r\nemployed in the street-sale of coals.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to ascertain correctly the amount of coals\r\ndistributed in this way among the poorer classes. But I have found\r\nthat they generally take two turns per day; that is they go to the\r\nwharfs in the morning, get their vans or carts loaded, and proceed\r\non their various rounds. This first turn usually occupies them till\r\ndinner-time, after which they get another load, which is sufficient to\r\nkeep them employed till night. Now if we allow each van to carry two\r\nand a half tons, it will make for all 150 tons per day, or 900 tons per\r\nweek. In the same manner allowing the 160 carts to carry a ton each,\r\nit will give 320 tons per day, or 1920 tons per week, and the twenty\r\npony carts half a ton each, 40 tons per day, or 240 tons per week,\r\nmaking a total of 3060 tons per week, or 159,120 tons per annum. This\r\nquantity purchased from the merchants at 14_s._ 6_d._ per ton amounts\r\nto 115,362_l._ annually, and sold at the rate of 1_s._ per cwt., or\r\n1_l._ per ton, leaves 5_s._ 6_d._ per ton profit, or a total profit of\r\n43,758_l._, and this profit divided according to the foregoing account\r\ngives the subjoined amounts, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    To each two-horse van regularly employed\r\n  throughout the year, a profit of            £429   0\r\n    To each one-horse cart, ditto, ditto,      171  12\r\n    To each pony cart, ditto, ditto,           121  12\r\n\r\nFrom which must, of course, be made the necessary deductions for the\r\nkeep of the animals and the repair of vehicles, harness, &c.\r\n\r\nThe keep of a good horse is 10_s._ per week; a pony 6_s._ Three horses\r\ncan be kept for the price of two, and so on; the more there are, the\r\nless cost for each.\r\n\r\nThe localities where the street-sellers of coals may most frequently\r\nbe met with, are Blackwall, Poplar, Limehouse, Stepney, St. George’s\r\nEast, Twig Folly, Bethnal Green, Spitalfields, Shoreditch, Kingsland,\r\nHaggerstone, and Islington. It is somewhat remarkable that they are\r\nalmost unknown on the south side of the Thames, and are seldom or never\r\nto be encountered in the low streets and lanes in Westminster lying\r\ncontiguous to the river, nor in the vicinity of Marylebone, nor in any\r\nplace farther west than Shoreditch; this is on account of the distance\r\nfrom the Regent’s Canal basin precluding the possibility of their\r\nmaking more than one turn in the day, which would greatly diminish\r\ntheir profits, even though they might get a higher price for their\r\ncommodity.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that the foregoing statement in figures is rather\r\nunder the mark than otherwise, as it is founded on the amount of coals\r\npurchased at a certain rate, and sold at a certain profit, without\r\ntaking into account any of the “dodges” which almost all classes of\r\ncoal dealers, from the highest to the lowest, are known to practise,\r\nso that the rate of profit arising from this business may be fairly\r\nsupposed to amount to much more than the above account can show in\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nI received the following statement from a person engaged in the street\r\ntraffic:--\r\n\r\n“I kept a coal-shed and greengrocer’s shop, and as I had a son grown\r\nup, I wanted to get something for him to do; so about six years ago,\r\nhaving a pony and cart, and seeing others selling coals through the\r\nstreet, I thought I’d make him try his hand at it. I went to Mr.\r\nB----’s, at Whiting’s wharf, and got the cart loaded, and sent my son\r\nround our own neighbourhood. I found that he soon disposed of them, and\r\nso he went on by degrees. People think we get a great deal of profit,\r\nbut we don’t get near as much as they think. I paid 16_s._ a ton all\r\nthe winter for coals and sold them for a shilling a hundred, and when\r\nI came to feed the horse I found that he’ll nearly eat it all up. A\r\nhorse’s belly is not so easy to fill. I don’t think my son earns much\r\nmore now, in summer, than feeds the horse. It’s different in winter;\r\nhe does not sell more nor half a ton a day now the weather’s so warm.\r\nIn winter he can always sell a ton at the least, and sometimes two,\r\nand on the Saturday he might sell three or four. My cart holds a ton;\r\nthe vans hold from two to three tons. I can’t exactly tell how many\r\npeople are engaged in selling coals in the street, but there are a\r\ngreat many, that’s certain. About eight o’clock what a number of carts\r\nand vans you’ll see about the Regent’s Canal! They like to get away\r\nbefore breakfast, because then they may have another turn after dinner.\r\nThere’s a great many go to other places for coals. The people who have\r\nvans do much better than those with the carts, because they carry so\r\nmuch that they save time. There are no great secrets in our business;\r\nwe haven’t the same chance of ‘doing the thing’ as the merchants have.\r\nThey can mix the coals up as they like for their customers, and sell\r\nthem for best; all we can do is to buy a low quality; then we may lose\r\nour customers if we play any tricks. To be sure, after that we can go\r\nto parts where we’re not known. I don’t use light weights, but I know\r\nit’s done by a good many, and they mix up small coals a good deal, and\r\nthat of course helps their profits. My son generally goes four or five\r\nmiles before he sells a ton of coals, and in summer weather a great\r\ndeal farther. It’s hard-earned money that’s got at it, I can tell you.\r\nMy cart is worth 12_l._; I have a van worth 20_l._ I wouldn’t take\r\n20_l._ for my horse. My van holds two tons of coals, and the horse\r\ndraws it easily. I send the van out in the winter when there’s a good\r\ncall, but in the summer I only send it out on the Saturday. I never\r\ncalculated how much profit I made. I haven’t the least idea how much is\r\ngot by it, but I’m sure there’s not near as much as you say. Why, if\r\nthere was, I ought to have made a fortune by this time.” [It is right\r\nI should state that I received the foregoing account of the profits of\r\nthe street trade in coals from one practically and eminently acquainted\r\nwith it.] “Some in the trade have done very well, but they were well\r\nenough off before. I know very well I’ll never make a fortune at\r\nanything; I’ll be satisfied if I keep moving along, so as to keep out\r\nof the Union.”\r\n\r\nAs to the habits of the street-sellers of coals, they are as various\r\nas their different circumstances will admit; but they closely resemble\r\neach other in one general characteristic--their provident and careful\r\nhabits. Many of them have risen from struggling costermongers, to be\r\nmen of substance, with carts, vans, and horses of their own. Some of\r\nthe more wealthy of the class may be met with now and then in the\r\nparlours of respectable public houses, where they smoke their pipes,\r\nsip their brandy and water, and are remarkable for the shrewdness\r\nof their remarks. They mingle freely with the respectable tradesmen\r\nof their own localities, and may be seen, especially on the Sunday\r\nafternoons, with their wives and showily-dressed daughters in the\r\ngardens of the New Globe, or Green Dragon--the Cremorne and Vauxhall\r\nof the east. I visited the house of one of those who I was told\r\nhad originally been a costermonger. The front portion of the shop\r\nwas almost filled with coals, he having added to his occupation of\r\nstreet-seller the business of a coal-shed man; this his wife and a\r\nlittle boy managed in his absence; while, true to his early training,\r\nthe window-ledge and a bench before it were heaped up with cabbages,\r\nonions, and other vegetables. In an open space opposite his door, I\r\nobserved a one-horse cart and two or three trucks with his name painted\r\nthereon. At his invitation, I passed through what may be termed the\r\nshop, and entered the parlour, a neat room nicely carpeted, with a\r\nround table in the centre, chairs ranged primly round the walls, and\r\na long looking-glass reflecting the china shepherds and shepherdesses\r\non the mantel-piece, while, framed and glazed, all around were\r\nhighly-coloured prints, among which, Dick Turpin, in flash red coat,\r\ngallantly clearing the toll-gate in his celebrated ride to York, and\r\nJack Sheppard lowering himself down from the window of the lock-up\r\nhouse, were most conspicuous. In the window lay a few books, and one or\r\ntwo old copies of _Bell’s Life_. Among the well thumbed books, I picked\r\nout the _Newgate Calendar_, and the “_Calendar of Orrers_,” as he\r\ncalled it, of which he expressed a very high opinion. “Lor bless you,”\r\nhe exclaimed, “them there stories is the vonderfullest in the vorld!\r\nI’d never ha believed it, if I adn’t seed it vith my own two hies, but\r\nthere can’t be no mistake ven I read it hout o’ the book, can there,\r\nnow? I jist asks yer that ere plain question.”\r\n\r\nOf his career he gave me the following account:--“I vos at von time a\r\ncoster, riglarly brought up to the business, the times vas good then;\r\nbut lor, ve used to lush at sich a rate! About ten year ago, I ses to\r\nmeself, I say Bill, I’m blowed if this here game ’ill do any longer. I\r\nhad a good moke (donkey), and a tidyish box ov a cart; so vot does I\r\ndo, but goes and sees von o’ my old pals that gits into the coal-line\r\nsomehow. He and I goes to the Bell and Siven Mackerels in the Mile\r\nEnd Road, and then he tells me all he knowed, and takes me along vith\r\nhisself, and from that time I sticks to the coals.\r\n\r\n“I niver cared much about the lush myself, and ven I got avay from the\r\nold uns, I didn’t mind it no how; but Jack my pal vos a awful lushy\r\ncove, he couldn’t do no good at nothink, votsomever; he died they\r\nsay of _lirium trumans_” [not understanding what he meant, I inquired\r\nof what it was he died]; “why, of _lirium trumans_, vich I takes to\r\nbe too much of Trueman and Hanbury’s heavy; so I takes varnin by poor\r\nJack, and cuts the lush; but if you thinks as ve don’t enjoy ourselves\r\nsometimes, I tells you, you don’t know nothink about it. I’m gittin on\r\nlike a riglar house a fire.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF COKE.\r\n\r\nAmong the occupations that have sprung up of late years is that of the\r\npurchase and distribution of the refuse cinders or coke obtained from\r\nthe different gas-works, which are supplied at a much cheaper rate\r\nthan coal. Several of the larger gas companies burn as many as 100,000\r\ntons of coals per annum, and some even more, and every ton thus burnt\r\nis stated to leave behind two chaldrons of coke, returning to such\r\ncompanies 50 per cent. of their outlay upon the coal. The distribution\r\nof coke is of the utmost importance to those whose poverty forces them\r\nto use it instead of coal.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the ten gas companies in and about the metropolis\r\nproduce at least 1,400,000 chaldrons of coke, which are distributed to\r\nthe poorer classes by vans, one-horse carts, donkey carts, trucks, and\r\nitinerant vendors who carry one, and in some cases two sacks lashed\r\ntogether on their backs, from house to house.\r\n\r\nThe van proprietors are those who, having capital, contract with the\r\ncompanies at a fixed rate per chaldron the year through, and supply\r\nthe numerous retail shops at the current price, adding 3_d._ per\r\nchaldron for carriage; thus speculating upon the rise or fall of the\r\narticle, and in most cases carrying on a very lucrative business. This\r\nclass numbers about 100 persons, and are to be distinguished by the\r\nwords “coke contractor,” painted on a showy ground on the exterior of\r\ntheir handsome well-made vehicles; they add to their ordinary business\r\nthe occupation of conveying to their destination the coke that the\r\ncompanies sell from time to time. These men have generally a capital,\r\nor a reputation for capital, to the extent of 400_l._ or 500_l._, and\r\nin some cases more, and they usually enter into their contracts with\r\nthe companies in the summer, when but small quantities of fuel are\r\nrequired, and the gas-works are incommoded for want of space to contain\r\nthe quantity made. They are consequently able, by their command of\r\nmeans, to make advantageous bargains, and several instances are known\r\nof men starting with a wheelbarrow in this calling and who are now the\r\nowners of the dwellings in which they reside, and have goods, vans, and\r\ncarts besides.\r\n\r\nAnother class, to whom may be applied much that has been said of the\r\nvan proprietors, are the possessors of one-horse carts, who in many\r\ninstances keep small shops for the sale of greens, coals, &c. These men\r\nare scattered over the whole metropolis, but as they do not exclusively\r\nobtain their living by vending this article, they do not properly\r\nbelong to this portion of the inquiry.\r\n\r\nA very numerous portion of the distributors of coke are the donkey-cart\r\nmen, who are to be seen in all the poorer localities with a quantity\r\nshot in the bottom of their cart, and two or three sacks on the top or\r\nfastened underneath--for it is of a light nature--ready to meet the\r\ndemand, crying “Coke! coke! coke!” morning, noon, and night. This they\r\nsell as low as 2_d._ per bushel, coke having, in consequence of the\r\ncheapness of coals, been sold at the gas-works by the single sack as\r\nlow as 7_d._, and although there is here a seeming contradiction--that\r\nof a man selling and living by the loss--such is not in reality the\r\ncase. It should be remembered that a bushel of good coke will weigh\r\n40 lbs., and that the bushels of these men rarely exceed 25 lbs.; so\r\nthat it will be seen that by this unprincipled mode of dealing they can\r\nseemingly sell for less than they give, and yet realize a good profit.\r\nThe two last classes are those who own a truck or wheelbarrow or are\r\nthe fortunate possessors of an athletic frame and broad shoulders,\r\nwho roam about near the vicinity of the gas-works, soliciting custom,\r\nobtaining ready cash if possible, but in most cases leaving one sack on\r\ncredit, and obtaining a profit of from 2_d._, 3_d._, 4_d._, or more.\r\nThese men are to be seen going from house to house cleverly regulating\r\ntheir arrival to such times as when the head of the family returns\r\nhome with his weekly wage, and in possession of ready cash enough to\r\nmake a bargain with the coke contractor. Another fact in connection\r\nwith this class, many of whom are women, who employ boys to drag or\r\ncarry their wares to their customers, is this: when they fail through\r\nany cause, they put their walk up for sale, and find no difficulty to\r\nobtain purchasers from 2_l._ to as high as 8_l._, 10_l._, and 12_l._\r\nThe street-sellers of coke number in all not less than 1500 persons,\r\nwho may be thus divided: van proprietors, 100; single horse carts,\r\n300; donkey-cart men, 500; trucks, wheelbarrows, and “physical force\r\nmen,” 550; and women about 50, who penetrate to all the densely-crowded\r\ndistricts about town distributing this useful article; the major\r\nportion of those who are of anything like sober habits, live in\r\ncomfort; and in spite of the opinion held by many, that the consumption\r\nof coke is injurious to health and sight, they carry on a large and\r\nincreasing business.\r\n\r\nAt the present time coke may be purchased at the gas factories at 6_s._\r\nper chaldron; but in winter it generally rises to 10_s._, so that,\r\ntaking the average, 8_s._, it will be found, that the gas factories of\r\nthe metropolis realize no less a sum than 560,000_l._ per annum, by\r\nthe _coke_ produced in the course of their operations. And 4_s._ per\r\nchaldron being considered a fair profit, it will be found, that the\r\ntotal profit arising from its sale by the various vendors is 280,000_l._\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to arrive with any degree of certainty at the actual\r\namount of business done by each of the above-named classes, and the\r\nprofits consequent on that business: by dividing the above amount\r\nequally among all the coke sellers, it will be found to give 186_l._\r\nper annum to each person. But it will be at once seen, that the same\r\nrule holds good in the coke trade that has already been explained\r\nin connection with coals: those possessing vans reaping the largest\r\namount of profit; the one-horse cart men next; then the donkey carts,\r\ntrucks, and wheelbarrows; and, least of all, the “backers,” as they are\r\nsometimes called.\r\n\r\nConcerning the amount of capital invested in the street-sale of coals\r\nit may be estimated as follows:--\r\n\r\n  If we allow 70_l._ for each of the 100\r\n    vans, it will give                       £7,000\r\n  20_l._ for each of the horses               2,000\r\n  300 carts at 10_l._ each                    3,000\r\n  300 horses at 10_l._ each                   3,000\r\n  500 donkey-carts at 1_l._ each                500\r\n  500 donkeys at 1_l._ each                     500\r\n  200 trucks and barrows at 10_s._ each         100\r\n                                            -------\r\n  making a total of                         £16,000\r\n\r\nTo this must be added\r\n\r\n  4800 sacks for the 100 vans at\r\n    3_s._ 6_d._ each                             840   0  0\r\n  3600 sacks for the 300 carts                   630   0  0\r\n  3000   „      „    500 donkey carts            525   0  0\r\n  1652   „      „    550 trucks and backers      288  15  0\r\n  300    „      „     50 women                    52  10  0\r\n                                             --------------\r\n                                             £18,336   5  0\r\n                                             --------------\r\n\r\n  Which being added to the value of vans,\r\n    carts, and horses employed in the\r\n    street-sale of coals, viz.                        6,865\r\n                                                   --------\r\n  gives a capital of                               £252,015\r\n                                                   --------\r\n\r\nemployed in the street-sale of coal and coke.\r\n\r\n  The profits of both these trades added\r\n    together, namely, that on coals                  43,758\r\n    and the profit on coke                          280,000\r\n                                                   --------\r\n  shows a total profit of                          £323,758\r\n\r\nto be divided among 1710 persons, who compose the class of itinerant\r\ncoal and coke vendors of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe following statement as to the street-sale of coke was given by a\r\nman in good circumstances, who had been engaged in the business for\r\nmany years:--\r\n\r\n“I am a native of the south of Ireland. More nor twenty years ago I\r\ncame to London. I had friends here working in a gas factory, and afther\r\na time they managed to get me into the work too. My business was to\r\nkeep the coals to the stokers, and when they emptied the retorts to\r\nwheel the coke in barrows and empty it on the coke heap. I worked for\r\nfour or five years, off and on, at this place. I was sometimes put\r\nout of work in the summer-time, because they don’t want as many hands\r\nthen. There’s not near so much gas burned in summer, and then, of\r\ncourse, it takes less hands to make it. Well, at last I got to be a\r\nstoker; I had betther wages thin, and a couple of pots of beer in the\r\nday. It was dhreadful hard work, and as hot, aye, as if you were in\r\nthe inside of an oven. I don’t know how I ever stood it. Be me soul,\r\nI don’t know how anybody stands it; it’s the divil’s place of all you\r\never saw in your life, standing there before them retorts with a long\r\nheavy rake, pullin out the red-hot coke for the bare life, and then\r\nthere’s the rake red-hot in your hands, and the hissin and the bubblin\r\nof the wather, and the smoke and the smell--it’s fit to melt a man like\r\na rowl of fresh butther. I wasn’t a bit too fond of it, at any rate,\r\nfor it ’ud kill a horse; so I ses to the wife, ‘I can’t stand this much\r\nlonger, Peggy.’ Well, behold you, Peggy begins to cry and wring her\r\nhands, thinkin we’d starve; but I knew a grate dale betther nor that,\r\nfor I was two or three times dhrinkin with some of thim that carry the\r\ncoke out of the yard in sacks to sell to the poor people, and they had\r\ntwice as much money to spind as me, that was working like a horse from\r\nmornin to night. I had a pound or two by me, for I was always savin,\r\nand by this time I knew a grate many people round about; so off I goes,\r\nand asks one and another to take a sack of coke from me, and bein\r\nknoun in the yard, and standin a dhrop o’ dhrink now and thin for the\r\nfillers, I alway got good measure, and so I used to make four sacks out\r\nof three, and often three out of two. Well, at last I got tired carryin\r\nsacks on me back all day, and now I know I was a fool for doin it at\r\nall, for it’s asier to dhrag a thruck with five or six sacks than to\r\ncarry one; so I got a second-hand thruck for little or nothin, and thin\r\nI was able to do five times as much work in half the time. At last,\r\nI took a notion of puttin so much every Sathurday night in the savin\r\nbank, and faith, sir, that was the lucky notion for me, although Peggy\r\nwouldn’t hear of it at all at all. She swore the bank ’ud be broke,\r\nand said she could keep the goold safer in her own stockin; that thim\r\ngintlemin in banks were all a set of blickards, and only desaved the\r\npoor people into givin them their money to keep it thimselves. But in\r\nspite of Peggy I put the money in, and it was well for me that I did\r\nso, for in a short time I could count up 30 or 40 guineas in bank, and\r\nwhin Peggy saw that the bank wasn’t broke she was quite satisfied; so\r\none day I ses to myself, What the divil’s the use of me breakin my\r\nheart mornin, noon, and night, dhraggin a thruck behind me, whin ever\r\nso little a bit of a horse would dhrag ten time as much as I can? so\r\noff I set to Smithfield, and bought a stout stump of a horse for 12_l._\r\n10_s._, and thin wint to a sale and bought an ould cart for little or\r\nnothin, and in less nor a month I had every farthin back again in the\r\nbank. Well, afther this, I made more and more every day, and findin\r\nthat I paid more for the coke in winther than in summer, I thought as\r\nI had money if I could only get a place to put a good lot in summer to\r\nsell in winther it would be a good thing; so I begun to look about, and\r\nfound this house for sale, so I bought it out and out. It was an ould\r\nhouse to be sure; but it’s sthrong enough, and dune up well enough for\r\na poor man--besides there’s the yard, and see in that yard there’s a\r\nhape o’ coke for the winther. I’m buyin it up now, an it ’ill turn a\r\nnice pinny whin the could weather comes again. To make a long story\r\nshort, I needn’t call the king my cousin. I’m sure any one can do well,\r\nif he likes; but I don’t mane that they can do well brakin their heart\r\nworkin; divil a one that sticks to work ’ill ever be a hapenny above a\r\nbeggar; and I know if I’d stuck to it myself I’d be a grate dale worse\r\noff now than the first day, for I’m not so young nor near so sthrong as\r\nI was thin, and if I hadn’t lift it off in time I’d have nothin at all\r\nto look to in a few years more but to ind my days in the workhouse--bad\r\nluck to it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF TAN-TURF.\r\n\r\nTan-turf is oak bark made into turf after its virtues have been\r\nexhausted in the tan-pits. To make it into turf the manufacturers have\r\na mill which is turned by horse-power, in which they grind the bark to\r\na considerable degree of fineness, after which it is shaped by a mould\r\ninto thin cakes about six inches square, put out to dry and harden, and\r\nwhen thoroughly hardened it is fit for sale and for all the uses for\r\nwhich it is intended.\r\n\r\nThere is only one place in London or its neighbourhood where there\r\nare tan-pits--in Bermondsey--and there only is the turf made. There\r\nare not more than a dozen persons in London engaged in the sale of\r\nthis commodity in the streets, and they are all of the tribe of the\r\ncostermongers. The usual capital necessary for starting in the line\r\nbeing a donkey and cart, with 9_s._ or 10_s._ to purchase a few\r\nhundreds of the turf.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition extant, even at the present day, that during the\r\nprevalence of the plague in London the houses where the tan-turf was\r\nused in a great measure escaped that awful visitation; and to this\r\nmoment many people purchase and burn it in their houses on account of\r\nthe peculiar smell, and under the belief that it is efficacious in\r\nrepelling infectious diseases from the localities in which it is used.\r\n\r\nThe other purposes for which it is used are for forming a sort of\r\ncompost or manure for plants of the heath kind, which delight in a soil\r\nof this description, growing naturally among mosses and bogs where the\r\npeat fuel is obtained. It is used also by small bakers for heating\r\ntheir ovens, as preferable for their purposes, and more economical\r\nthan any other description of fuel. Sometimes it is used for burning\r\nunder coppers; and very often for keeping alight during the night, on\r\naccount of the slowness of its decomposition by fire, for a single cake\r\nwill continue burning for a whole night, will be found in the morning\r\ncompletely enveloped in a white ash, which, on being removed, discovers\r\nthe live embers in the centre.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which the tan turf is sold to the dealers, at the tan-pits,\r\nis from 6_d._ to 9_d._ per hundred cakes. Those at 9_d._ per hundred\r\nare perfect and unbroken, while those at 6_d._ have been injured in\r\nsome way or other. The quality of the article, however, remains the\r\nsame, and by purchasing some of each sort the vendors are able to make\r\nsomewhat more profit, which may be, on an average, about 4-1/2_d._ per\r\nhundred, as they sell it at 1_s._\r\n\r\nWhile seeking information on this subject I obtained the address of a\r\nperson in T---- mews, T---- square, engaged in the business. Running\r\nout of the square is a narrow street, which, about mid-way through,\r\nleads on the right-hand side to a narrow alley, at the bottom of which\r\nis the mews, consisting of merely an oblong court, surrounded by\r\nstables of the very smallest dimensions, not one of them being more\r\nthan twelve feet square. Three or four men, in the long waistcoats and\r\nfull breeches peculiar to persons engaged among horses, were lounging\r\nabout, and, with the exception of the horses, appeared to be the only\r\ninhabitants of the place. On inquiring of one of the loungers, I was\r\nshown a stable in one corner of the court, the wide door of which stood\r\nopen. On entering I found it occupied by a donkey-cart, containing a\r\ncouple of hundred cakes of tan-turf; another old donkey-cart was turned\r\nup opposite, the tailboard resting on the ground, the shafts pointing\r\nto the ceiling, while a cock and two or three draggle-tailed hens were\r\ncomposing themselves to roost on the front portion of the cart between\r\nthe shafts. Within the space thus inclosed by the two carts lay a\r\ndonkey and two dogs, that seemed keeping him company, and were busily\r\nengaged in mumbling and crunching some old bones. On the wall hung\r\n“Jack’s harness.” In one corner of the ceiling was an opening giving\r\naccess to the place above, which was reached by means of a long ladder.\r\nOn ascending this I found myself in a very small attic, with a sloping\r\nceiling on both sides. In the highest part, the middle of the room,\r\nit was not more than six feet high, but at the sides it was not more\r\nthan three feet. In this confined apartment stood a stump bedstead,\r\ntaking up the greater portion of the floor. In a corner alongside the\r\nfire-place I noticed what appeared to be a small turn-up bedstead. A\r\nlittle ricketty deal table, an old smoke dried Dutch clock, and a poor\r\nold woman, withered and worn, were the only other things to be seen in\r\nthe place. The old woman had been better off, and, as is not uncommon\r\nunder such circumstances, she endeavoured to make her circumstances\r\nappear better than they really were. She made the following statement:--\r\n\r\n“My husband was 23 years selling the tan turf. There used to be a great\r\ndeal more of it sold than there is now; people don’t seem to think so\r\nmuch of it now, as they once did, but there are some who still use it.\r\nThere’s an old lady in Kentish-town, who must have it regularly; she\r\nburns it on account of the smell, and has burned it for many years:\r\nmy husband used to serve her. There’s an old doctor at Hampstead--or\r\nrather he was there, for he died a few days ago--he always bought a\r\ndeal of it, but I don’t know whether he burned it or not; he used to\r\nbuy 500 or 600 at a time, he was a very good customer, and we miss him\r\nnow. The gardeners buy some of it, for their plants, they say it makes\r\ngood manure, though you wouldn’t think so to look at it, it’s so hard\r\nand dry. My husband is dead three years; we were better off when he was\r\nalive; he was a very sober and careful man, and never put anything to\r\nwaste. My youngest son goes with the cart now; he don’t do as well as\r\nhis father, poor little fellow! he’s only fourteen years of age, but he\r\ndoes very well for a boy of his age. He sometimes travels 30 miles of\r\na day, and can’t sell a load--sometimes not half a load; and then he\r\ncomes home of a night so footsore that you’d pity him. Sometimes he’s\r\nnot able to stir out, for a day or two, but he must do something for\r\na living; there’s nothing to be got by idleness. The cart will hold\r\n1000 or 1200, and if he could sell that every day we’d do very well; it\r\nwould leave us about 3_s._ 6_d._ profit, after keeping the donkey. It\r\ncosts 9_d._ a day to keep our donkey; he’s young yet, but he promises\r\nto be a good strong animal, and I like to keep him well, even if I\r\ngo short myself, for what could we do without him? I believe there\r\nare one or two persons selling tan-turf who use trucks, but they’re\r\nstrong; besides they can’t do much with a truck, they can’t travel as\r\nfar with a truck as a donkey can, and they can’t take as much out with\r\nthem. My son goes of a morning to Bermondsey for a load, and is back by\r\nbreakfast time; from this to Bermondsey is a long way--then he goes out\r\nand travels all round Kentish-town and Hampstead, and what with going\r\nup one street and down another, by the time he comes home at night, he\r\ndon’t travel less than from 25 to 30 miles a day. I have another son,\r\nthe eldest. He used to go with his father when he was alive; he was\r\nreared to the business, but after he died he thought it was useless for\r\nboth to go out with the cart, so he left it to the little fellow, and\r\nnow the eldest works among horses. He don’t do much, only gets an odd\r\njob now and then among the ostlers, and earns a shilling now and then.\r\nThey’re both good lads, and would do well if they could; they do as\r\nwell as they can, and I have a right to be thankful for it.”\r\n\r\nThe poor woman, notwithstanding the extraordinary place in which\r\nshe lived, and the confined dimensions of her single apartment (I\r\nascertained that the two sons slept in the stump bedstead, while she\r\nused the turn-up), was nevertheless cleanly in her person and apparel,\r\nand superior in many respects to persons of the same class, and I give\r\nher statement verbatim, as it corroborates, in almost every particular,\r\nthe statement of the unfortunate seller of salt, who is afflicted with\r\na drunken disorderly wife, and who is also a man superior to the people\r\nwith whom he is compelled to associate, but who in evident bitterness\r\nof spirit made this assertion: “Bad as I’m off now, if I had only a\r\ncareful partner, I wouldn’t want for anything.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the dogs that I have spoken of as being with the donkey,\r\nthere is a curious story. During his rounds the donkey frequently met\r\nthe bitch, and an extraordinary friendship grew up between the two\r\nanimals, so that the dog at last forsook its owner, and followed the\r\ndonkey in all his travels. For some time back she has accompanied him\r\nhome, together with her puppy, and they all sleep cozily together\r\nduring the night, Jack taking especial care not to hurt the young one.\r\nIn the morning, when about to go out for the day’s work, it is of no\r\nuse to expect Jack to go without his friends, as he will not budge an\r\ninch, so he is humoured in his whim. The puppy, when tired, is put into\r\nthe cart, and the mother forages for her living along the way; the poor\r\nwoman not being able to feed them. The owner of the dogs came to see\r\nthem on the day previous to my visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SALT.\r\n\r\nUntil a few years after the repeal of the duty on the salt, there were\r\nno street-sellers of it. It was first taxed in the time of William\r\nIII., and during the war with Napoleon the impost was 15_s._ the\r\nbushel, or nearly thirty times the cost of the article taxed. The duty\r\nwas finally repealed in 1823. When the tax was at the highest, salt\r\nwas smuggled most extensively, and retailed at 4_d._ and 4-1/2_d._ the\r\npound. A licence to sell it was also necessary. Street salt-selling is\r\ntherefore a trade of some twenty years standing. Considering the vast\r\nconsumption of salt, and the trifling amount of capital necessary to\r\nstart in the business, it might be expected that the street-sellers\r\nwould be a numerous class, but they do not number above 150 at the\r\noutside. The reason assigned by a well-informed man was, that in every\r\npart of London there are such vast numbers of shopkeepers who deal in\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n    About one-half of those employed in\r\n  street salt-selling have donkeys and\r\n  carts, and the rest use the two-wheeled\r\n  barrow of the costermonger, to which\r\n  class the street salt-sellers, generally,\r\n  belong. The value of the\r\n  donkey and cart may be about 2_l._ 5_s._\r\n  on an average, so that 75 of the\r\n  number possessing donkeys and carts\r\n  will have a capital among them equal\r\n  to the sum of                                    £168  15  0\r\n    The barrows of the remainder are\r\n  worth about 10_s._ each, which will\r\n  amount to                                          37  10  0\r\n    To sell 3 cwt. of salt in a day is considered\r\n  good work; and this, if purchased\r\n  at 2_s._ per cwt., gives for stock-money\r\n  the sum total of                                   45   0  0\r\n                                                   -----------\r\n    Thus the amount of capital which\r\n  may be reasonably assumed to be\r\n  embarked in this business is                     £251   5  0\r\n                                                   -----------\r\n\r\nThe street-sellers pay at the rate of 2_s._ per cwt. for the salt, and\r\nretail it at 3 lbs. for 1_d._, which leaves 1_s._ 1_d._ profit on every\r\ncwt. One day with another, taking wet and dry, for from the nature of\r\nthe article it cannot be hawked in wet weather, the street-sellers\r\ndispose of about 2-1/2 cwt. per day, or 18 tons 15 cwt. per day for all\r\nhands, which, deducting Sundays, makes 5825 tons in the course of the\r\nyear. The profit of 1_s._ 1_d._ per cwt. amounts to a yearly aggregate\r\nprofit of 6310_l._ 8_s._ 4_d._, or about 42_l._ per annum for each\r\nperson in the trade.\r\n\r\nThe salt dealers, generally, endeavour to increase their profits by the\r\nsale of mustard, and sometimes by the sale of rock-salt, which is used\r\nfor horses; but in these things they do little, the most profit they\r\ncan realize in a day averaging about 4_d._\r\n\r\nThe salt men who merely use the barrow are much better off than the\r\ndonkey-cart men; the former are young men, active and strong, well\r\nable to drive their truck or barrow about from one place to another,\r\nand they can thereby save the original price and subsequent keep of\r\nthe donkey. The latter are in general old men, broken down and weak,\r\nor lads. The daily cost of keeping a donkey is from 6_d._ to 9_d._; if\r\nwe reckon 7-1/2_d._ as the average, it will annually amount to 11_l._\r\n8_s._ 1_d._ the year, which will reduce the profit of 42_l._ to about\r\n30_l._, and so leave a balance of 11_l._ 8_s._ 1_d._ in favour of the\r\ntruck or barrow man.\r\n\r\nThere are nine or ten places where the street-sellers purchase the\r\nsalt:--Moore’s, at Paddington, who get their salt by the canal, from\r\nStaffordshire; Welling’s, at Battle-bridge; Baillie, of Thames-street,\r\n&c. Great quantities are brought to London by the different railways.\r\nThe street-sellers have all regular beats, and seldom intrude on each\r\nother, though it sometimes happens, especially when any quarrel occurs\r\namong them, that they oppose and undersell one another in order to\r\nsecure the customers.\r\n\r\nDuring my inquiries on this subject, I visited Church-lane, Bloomsbury,\r\nto see a street-seller, about seven in the evening. Since the\r\nalterations in St. Giles’s, Church-lane has become one of the most\r\ncrowded places in London. The houses, none of which are high, are all\r\nold, time-blackened, and dilapidated, with shattered window-frames\r\nand broken panes. Stretching across the narrow street, from all the\r\nupper windows, might be seen lines crossing and recrossing each other,\r\non which hung yellow-looking shirts, stockings, women’s caps, and\r\nhandkerchiefs looking like soiled and torn paper, and throwing the\r\nwhole lane into shade. Beneath this ragged canopy, the street literally\r\nswarmed with human beings--young and old, men and women, boys and\r\ngirls, wandering about amidst all kinds of discordant sounds. The\r\nfootpaths on both sides of the narrow street were occupied here and\r\nthere by groups of men and boys, some sitting on the flags and others\r\nleaning against the wall, while their feet, in most instances bare,\r\ndabbled in the black channel alongside the kerb, which being disturbed\r\nsent up a sickening stench. Some of these groups were playing cards for\r\nmoney, which lay on the ground near them. Men and women at intervals\r\nlay stretched out in sleep on the pathway; over these the passengers\r\nwere obliged to jump; in some instances they stood on their backs as\r\nthey stepped over them, and then the sleeper languidly raised his head,\r\ngrowled out a drowsy oath, and slept again. Three or four women, with\r\nbloated countenances, blood-shot eyes, and the veins of their necks\r\nswollen and distended till they resembled strong cords, staggered about\r\nviolently quarrelling at the top of their drunken voices.\r\n\r\nThe street salt-seller--whom I had great difficulty in finding in such\r\na place--was a man of about 50, rather sickly in his look. He wore an\r\nold cloth cap without a peak, a sort of dun-coloured waistcoat, patched\r\nand cobbled, a strong check shirt, not remarkable for its cleanliness,\r\nand what seemed to me to be an old pair of buckskin breeches, with\r\nfragments hanging loose about them like fringes. To the covering of\r\nhis feet--I can hardly say shoes--there seemed to be neither soles nor\r\nuppers. How they kept on was a mystery.\r\n\r\nIn answer to my questions, he made the following statement, in language\r\nnot to be anticipated from his dress, or the place in which he resided:\r\n“For many years I lived by the sale of toys, such as little chairs,\r\ntables, and a variety of other little things which I made myself and\r\nsold in the streets; and I used to make a good deal of money by them;\r\nI might have done well, but when a man hasn’t got a careful partner,\r\nit’s of no use what he does, he’ll never get on, he may as well give\r\nit up at once, for the money’ll go out ten times as fast as he can\r\nbring it in. I hadn’t the good fortune to have a careful woman, but one\r\nwho, when I wouldn’t give her money to waste and destroy, took out my\r\nproperty and made money of it to drink; where a bad example like that\r\nis set, it’s sure to be followed; the good example is seldom taken,\r\nbut there’s no fear of the bad one. You may want to find out where the\r\nevil lies, I tell you it lies in that pint pot, and in that quart pot,\r\nand if it wasn’t for so many pots and so many pints, there wouldn’t\r\nbe half so much misery as there is. I know that from my own case. I\r\nused to sell toys, but since the foreign things were let come over, I\r\ncouldn’t make anything of them, and was obliged to give them up. I was\r\nforced to do something for a living, for a half loaf is better than no\r\nbread at all, so seeing two or three selling salt, I took to it myself.\r\nI buy my salt at Moore’s wharf, Paddington; I consider it the purest;\r\nI could get salt 3_d._ or 2_d._ the cwt., or even cheaper, but I’d\r\nrather have the best. A man’s not ashamed when he knows his articles\r\nare good. Some buy the cheap salt, of course they make more profit. We\r\nnever sell by measure, always by weight; some of the street weights,\r\na good many of them, are slangs, but I believe they are as honest as\r\nmany of the shopkeepers after all; every one does the best he can to\r\ncheat everybody else. I go two or three evenings in the week, or as\r\noften as I want it, to the wharf for a load. I’m going there to-night,\r\nthree miles out and three miles in. I sell, considering everything,\r\nabout 2 cwt. a day; I sold 1-1/2 to-day, but to-morrow (Saturday)\r\nI’ll sell 3 or 4 cwt., and perhaps more. I pay 2_s._ the cwt. for it,\r\nand make about 1_s._ a cwt. profit on that. I sold sixpennyworth of\r\nmustard to-day; it might bring me in 2_d._ profit, every little makes\r\nsomething. If I wasn’t so weak and broke down, I wouldn’t trouble\r\nmyself with a donkey, it’s so expensive; I’d easily manage to drive\r\nabout all I’d sell, and then I’d save the expense. It costs me 7_d._\r\nor 8_d._ a day to keep him, besides other things. I got him a set of\r\nshoes yesterday, I said I’d shoe him first and myself afterwards; so\r\nyou see there’s other expenses. There’s my son, too, paid off the\r\nother day from the _Prince of Wales_, after a four years’ voyage, and\r\nhe came home without a sixpence in his pocket. He might have done\r\nsomething for me, but I couldn’t expect anything else from him after\r\nthe example that was set to him. Even now, bad as I am, I wouldn’t want\r\nfor anything if I had a careful woman; but she’s a shocking drunkard,\r\nand I can do nothing with her.” This poor fellow’s mind was so full of\r\nhis domestic troubles that he recurred to them again and again, and was\r\nmore inclined to talk about what so nearly concerned himself than on\r\nany matter of business.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SAND.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of sand only are sold in the streets, scouring or floor sand,\r\nand bird sand for birds. In scouring sand the trade is inconsiderable\r\nto what it was, saw-dust having greatly superseded it in the\r\ngin-palace, the tap-room, and the butcher’s shop. Of the supply of\r\nsand, a man, who was working at the time on Hampstead-heath, gave the\r\nfollowing account:--“I’ve been employed here for five-and-thirty years,\r\nunder Sir Thomas Wilson. Times are greatly changed, sir; we used to\r\nhave from 25 to 30 carts a day hawking sand, and taking six or seven\r\nmen to fill them every morning; besides large quantities which went to\r\nbrass-founders, and for cleaning dentists’ cutlery, for stone-sawing,\r\nlead and silver casting, and such like. This heath, sir, contains\r\nabout every kind of sand, but Sir Thomas won’t allow us to dig it. The\r\ngreatest number of carts filled now is eight or ten a day, which I fill\r\nmyself. Sir Thomas has raised the price from 3_s._ 6_d._ to 4_s._ a\r\nload, of about 2-1/2 tons. Bless you, sir, some years ago, one might go\r\ninto St. Luke’s, and sell five or six cart-loads of house-sand a week;\r\nnow, a man may roar himself hoarse, and not sell a load in a fortnight.\r\nSaw-dust is used in all the public-houses and gin-palaces. People’s\r\nsprung up who don’t use sand at all; and many of the old people are too\r\npoor to buy it. The men who get sand here now are old customers, who\r\ncarry it all over the town, and round Holloway, Islington, and such\r\nparts. Twelve year ago I would have taken here 6_l._ or 7_l._ in a\r\nmorning, to-day I have only taken 9_s._ Fine weather is greatly against\r\nthe sale of house-sand; in wet, dirty weather, the sale is greater.”\r\n\r\nOne street sand-seller gave the following account of his calling:--\r\n\r\n“I have been in the sand business, man and boy, for 40 years. I was\r\nat it when I was 12 years old, and am now 52. I used to have two carts\r\nhawking sand, but it wouldn’t pay, so I have just that one you see\r\nthere. Hawking sand is a poor job now. I send two men with that ’ere\r\ncart, and pay one of ’em 3_s._ 4_d._ and the other 3_s._ a day. Now,\r\nwith beer-money, 2_s._ a week, to the man at the heath, and turnpike\r\ngates, I reckon every load of sand to cost me 5_s._ Add to that 6_s._\r\n4_d._ for the two men, the wear and tear, and horse’s keep (and, to do\r\na horse justice, you cannot in these cheap times keep him at less than\r\n10_s._ a week, in dear seasons, it will cost 15_s._), and you will find\r\neach load of sand stands me in a good sum. So suppose we get a guinea a\r\nload, you see we have no great pull. Then there’s the licence, 8_l._ a\r\nyear. Many years ago we resisted this, and got Mr. Humphreys to defend\r\nus before the magistrates at Clerkenwell; but we were ‘cast,’ several\r\nhawkers were fined 10_l._, and I was brought up before old Sir Richard\r\nBirnie, at Bow-street, and had to find bail that I would not sell\r\nanother bushel of sand till I took out a licence. Soon after that Sir\r\nThomas Wilson shut up the heath from us; he said he would not have it\r\ncut about any more, for that a poor animal could not pick up a crumb\r\nwithout being in danger of breaking its leg. This was just after we\r\ntook out our licences, and, as we’d paid dearly for being allowed to\r\nsell the sand, some of us, and I was one, we waited upon Sir Thomas,\r\nand asked to be allowed to work out our licences, which was granted,\r\nand we have gone on ever since. My men work very hard for their money,\r\nsir; they are up at 3 o’clock of the morning, and are knocking about\r\nthe streets, perhaps till 5 or 6 o’clock in the evening.”\r\n\r\nThe yellow house-sand is also found at Kingsland, and at the Kensington\r\nGravel-pits; but at the latter place street-sellers are not supplied.\r\nThe sand here is very fine, and mostly disposed of to plasterers. There\r\nis also some of this kind of sand at Wandsworth. In the street-selling\r\nof house-sand, there are now not above 30 men employed, and few of\r\nthese trade on their own account. Reckoning the horses and carts\r\nemployed in the trade at the same price as our Camden-town informant\r\nsets on his stock, we have 20 horses, at 10_l._ each, and 20 carts,\r\nat 3_l._ each, with 3 baskets to each, at 2_s._ apiece, making a\r\ntotal of 236_l._ of capital employed in the carrying machinery of the\r\nstreet-selling of sand. Allowing 3_s._ a day for each man, the wages\r\nwould amount for 30 men to 27_l._ weekly; and the expenses for horses’\r\nkeep, at 10_s._ a head, would give, for 20 horses, 10_l._ weekly,\r\nmaking a total of 38_l._ weekly, or an annual expenditure for man and\r\nhorse of 2496_l._ Calculating the sale at a load per day, for each\r\nhorse and cart, at 21_s._ a load, we have 6573_l._ annually expended in\r\nthe purchase of house or floor-sand.\r\n\r\n_Bird-sand_, or the fine and dry sand required for the use of\r\ncage-birds, is now obtained altogether of a market gardener in Hackney.\r\nIt is sold at 8_d._ the barrow-load; as much being shovelled on to\r\na coster’s barrow “as it will carry.” A good-sized barrow holds\r\n3-1/2 bushels; a smaller size, 3 bushels, and the buyer is also the\r\nshoveller. Three-fourths of the quantity conveyed by the street-sellers\r\nfrom Hackney is sold to the bird-shop keepers at 6_d._ for 3 pecks.\r\nThe remainder is disposed of to such customers as purchase it in the\r\nstreet, or is delivered at private houses, which receive a regular\r\nsupply. The usual charge to the general public is a halfpenny or a\r\npenny for sand to fill any vessel brought to contain it. A penny a\r\ngallon is perhaps an average price in this retail trade.\r\n\r\nA man, “in a good way of business,” disposes of a barrow-load once\r\na week; the others once a fortnight. In wet or windy weather great\r\ncare is necessary, and much trouble incurred in supplying this sand\r\nto the street-sellers, and again in their vending it in the streets.\r\nThe street-vendors are the same men as supply the turf, &c., for\r\ncage-birds, of whom I have treated, p. 156, vol. i. They are 40 in\r\nnumber, and although they do not all supply sand, a matter beyond\r\nthe strength of the old and infirm, a few costermongers convey a\r\nbarrow-load of sand now and then to the bird-sellers, and this addition\r\nensures the weekly supply of 40 barrow-loads. Calculating these at\r\nthe wholesale, or bird-dealer’s price--2_s._ 3_d._ a barrow being an\r\naverage--we find 234_l._ yearly expended in this sand. What is vended\r\nat 2_s._ 3_d._ costs but 8_d._ at the wholesale price; but the profit\r\nis hardly earned considering the labour of wheeling a heavy barrow of\r\nsand for miles, and the trouble of keeping over night what is unsold\r\nduring the day.\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SHELLS.\r\n\r\nThe street-trade in shells presents the characteristics I have before\r\nhad to notice as regards the trade in what are not necessaries, or an\r\napproach to necessaries, in contradistinction of what men must have to\r\neat or wear. Shells, such as the green snail, ear shell, and others\r\nof that class, though extensively used for inlaying in a variety of\r\nornamental works, are comparatively of little value; for no matter\r\nhow useful, if shells are only well known, they are considered of\r\nbut little importance; while those which are rarely seen, no matter\r\nhow insignificant in appearance, command extraordinary prices. As an\r\ninstance I may mention that on the 23rd of June there was purchased\r\nby Mr. Sowerby, shell-dealer, at a public sale in King-street,\r\nCovent-garden, a small shell not two inches long, broken and damaged,\r\nand withal what is called a “dead shell,” for the sum of 30 guineas. It\r\nwas described as the _Conus Glory Mary_, and had it only been perfect\r\nwould have fetched 100 guineas.\r\n\r\nShells, such as conches, cowries, green snails, and ear shells (the\r\nlatter being so called from their resemblance to the human ear), are\r\nimported in large quantities, as parts of cargoes, and are sold to\r\nthe large dealers by weight. Conch shells are sold at 8_s._ per cwt.;\r\ncowries and clams from 10_s._ to 12_s._ per cwt.; the green snail,\r\nused for inlaying, fetches from 1_l._ to 1_l._ 10_s._ per cwt.; and\r\nthe ear shell, on account of its superior quality and richer variety\r\nof colours, as much as 3_l._ and 5_l._ per cwt. The conches are found\r\nonly among the West India Islands, and are used principally for garden\r\nornaments and grotto-work. The others come principally from the Indian\r\nOcean and the China seas, and are used as well for chimney ornaments,\r\nas for inlaying, for the tops of work-tables and other ornamental\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nThe shells which are considered of the most value are almost invariably\r\nsmall, and of an endless variety of shape. They are called “cabinet”\r\nshells, and are brought from all parts of the world--land as well as\r\nsea--lakes, rivers, and oceans furnishing specimens to the collection.\r\nThe Australian forests are continually ransacked to bring to light new\r\nvarieties. I have been informed that there is not a river in England\r\nbut contains valuable shells; that even in the Thames there are shells\r\nworth from 10_s._ to 1_l._ each. I have been shown a shell of the snail\r\nkind, found in the woods of New Holland, and purchased by a dealer for\r\n2_l._, and on which he confidently reckoned to make a considerable\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nAlthough “cabinet” shells are collected from all parts, yet by far the\r\ngreater number come from the Indian Ocean. They are generally collected\r\nby the natives, who sell them to captains and mates of vessels trading\r\nto those parts, and very often to sailors, all of whom frequently\r\nspeculate to a considerable extent in these things, and have no\r\ndifficulty in disposing of them as soon as they arrive in this country,\r\nfor there is not a shell dealer in London who has not a regular staff\r\nof persons stationed at Gravesend to board the homeward-bound ships at\r\nthe Nore, and sometimes as far off as the Downs, for the purpose of\r\npurchasing shells. It usually happens that when three or four of these\r\npersons meet on board the same ship, an animated competition takes\r\nplace, so that the shells on board are generally bought up long before\r\nthe ship arrives at London. Many persons from this country go out to\r\nvarious parts of the world for the sole purpose of procuring shells,\r\nand they may be found from the western coast of Africa to the shores\r\nof New South Wales, along the Persian Gulf, in Ceylon, the Malaccas,\r\nChina, and the Islands of the Pacific, where they employ the natives in\r\ndredging the bed of the ocean, and are by this means continually adding\r\nto the almost innumerable varieties which are already known.\r\n\r\nTo show the extraordinary request in which shells are held in almost\r\nevery place, while I was in the shop of Mr. J. C. Jamrach, naturalist,\r\nand agent to the Zoological Society at Amsterdam--one of the largest\r\ndealers in London, and to whom I am indebted for much valuable\r\ninformation on this subject--a person, a native of High Germany, was\r\npresent. He had arrived in London the day before, and had purchased on\r\nthat day a collection of shells of a low quality for which he paid Mr.\r\nJamrach 36_l._; to this he added a few birds. Placing his purchase in\r\na box furnished with a leather strap, he slung it over his shoulder,\r\nshook hands with Mr. Jamrach, and departed. Mr. Jamrach informed me\r\nthat the next morning he was to start by steam for Rotterdam, then\r\ncontinue his journey up the Rhine to a certain point, from whence he\r\nwas to travel on foot from one place to another, till he could dispose\r\nof his commodities; after which he would return to London, as the great\r\nmart for a fresh supply. He was only a very poor man, but there are\r\na great many others far better off, continually coming backwards and\r\nforwards, who are able to purchase a larger stock of shells and birds,\r\nand who, in the course of their peregrinations, wander through the\r\ngreater part of Germany, extending their excursions sometimes through\r\nAustria, the Tyrol, and the north of Italy. A visit to the premises of\r\nMr. Jamrach, Ratcliff-highway, or Mr. Samuel, Upper East Smithfield,\r\nwould well repay the curious observer. The front portion of Mr.\r\nJamrach’s house is taken up with a wonderful variety of strange birds\r\nthat keep up an everlasting screaming; in another portion of the house\r\nare collected confusedly together heaps of nondescript articles, which\r\nmight appear to the uninitiated worth little or nothing, but on which\r\nthe possessor places great value. In a yard behind the house, immured\r\nin iron cages, are some of the larger species of birds, and some\r\nbeautiful varieties of foreign animals--while in large presses ranged\r\nround the other rooms, and furnished with numerous drawers, are placed\r\nhis real valuables, the cabinet shells. The establishment of Mr. Samuel\r\nis equally curious.\r\n\r\nIn London, the dealers in shells, keeping shops for the sale of them,\r\namount to no more than ten; they are all doing a large business, and\r\nare men of good capital, which may be proved by the following quotation\r\nfrom the day-books of one of the class for the present year, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  Shells sold in February     £275   0   0\r\n  Ditto, ditto, March          471   0   0\r\n  Ditto, ditto, April         1389   0   0\r\n  Ditto, ditto, May            475   0   0\r\n                             -------------\r\n          Total              £2610   0   0\r\n                             -------------\r\n  Profit on same, February     £75  12   0\r\n  Ditto, ditto, March          140   0   0\r\n  Ditto, ditto, April          323   0   0\r\n  Ditto, ditto, May            127   0   0\r\n                             -------------\r\n          Total               £665  12   0\r\n\r\nBesides these there are about 20 private dealers who do not keep\r\nshops, but who nevertheless do a considerable business in this line\r\namong persons at the West End of London. All shell dealers add to that\r\noccupation the sale of foreign birds and curiosities.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another class of persons who seem to be engaged in the\r\nsale of shells, but it is only seeming. They are dressed as sailors,\r\nand appear at all times to have just come ashore after a long voyage,\r\nas a man usually follows them with that sort of canvas bag in use among\r\nsailors, in which they stow away their clothes; the men themselves\r\ngo on before carrying a parrot or some rare bird in one hand, and in\r\nthe other a large shell. These men are the “duffers” of whom I have\r\nspoken in my account of the sale of foreign birds. They make shells a\r\nmore frequent medium for the introduction of their real avocation, as\r\na shell is a far less troublesome thing either to hawk or keep by them\r\nthan a parrot.\r\n\r\nI now give a description of these men, as general duffers, and from\r\ngood authority.\r\n\r\n“They are known by the name of ‘_duffers_,’ and have an exceedingly\r\ncunning mode of transacting their business. They are all united in some\r\nsecret bond; they have persons also bound to them, who are skilled\r\nin making shawls in imitation of those imported from China, and who,\r\naccording to the terms of their agreement, must not work for any other\r\npersons. The duffers, from time to time, furnish these persons with\r\ndesigns for shawls, such as cannot be got in this country, which,\r\nwhen completed, they (the duffers) conceal about their persons, and\r\nstart forward on their travels. They contrive to gain admission to\r\nrespectable houses by means of shells and sometimes of birds, which\r\nthey purchase from the regular dealers, but always those of a low\r\nquality; after which they contrive to introduce the shawls, their real\r\nbusiness, for which they sometimes have realized prices varying from\r\n5_l._ to 20_l._ In many instances, the cheat is soon discovered, when\r\nthe duffers immediately decamp, to make place for a fresh batch, who\r\nhave been long enough out of London to make their faces unknown to\r\ntheir former victims. These remain till they also find danger threaten\r\nthem, when they again start away, and others immediately take their\r\nplace. While away from London, they travel through all parts of the\r\ncountry, driving a good trade among the country gentlemen’s houses; and\r\nsometimes visiting the seaports, such as Liverpool, Portsmouth, and\r\nPlymouth.”\r\n\r\nAn instance of the skill with which the duffers sometimes do business,\r\nis the following. One of these persons some time ago came into the\r\nshop of a shell dealer, having with him a beautiful specimen of a\r\nthree-coloured cockatoo, for which he asked 10_l._ The shell dealer\r\ndeclined the purchase at that price, saying, that he sold these birds\r\nat 4_l._ a piece, but offered to give 3_l._ 10_s._ for it, which was\r\nat once accepted; while pocketing the money, the man remarked that\r\nhe had paid ten guineas for that bird. The shell dealer, surprised\r\nthat so good a judge should be induced to give so much more than the\r\nvalue of the bird, was desirous of hearing further, when the duffer\r\nmade this statement:--“I went the other day to a gentleman’s house,\r\nhe was an old officer, where I saw this bird, and, in order to get\r\nintroduced, I offered to purchase it. The gentleman said he knew it was\r\na valuable bird, and couldn’t think of taking less than ten guineas. I\r\nthen offered to barter for it, and produced a shawl, for which I asked\r\ntwenty-five guineas, but offered to take fifteen guineas and the bird.\r\nThis was at length agreed to, and now, having sold it for 3_l._ 10_s._,\r\nit makes 19_l._ 5_s._ I got for the shawl, and not a bad day’s work\r\neither.”\r\n\r\nOf shells there are about a million of the commoner sorts bought by the\r\nLondon street-sellers at 3_s._ the gross. They are retailed at 1_d._\r\napiece, or 12_s._ the gross, when sold separately; a large proportion,\r\nas is the case with many articles of taste or curiosity rather than of\r\nusefulness, being sold by the London street-folk on country rounds;\r\nsome of these rounds stretch half-way to Bristol or to Liverpool.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE RIVER BEER-SELLERS, OR PURL-MEN.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another class of itinerant dealers who, if not traders\r\nin the streets, are traders in what was once termed the silent\r\nhighway--the river beer-sellers, or purl-men, as they are more commonly\r\ncalled. These should strictly have been included among the sellers of\r\neatables and drinkables; they have, however, been kept distinct, being\r\na peculiar class, and having little in common with the other out-door\r\nsellers.\r\n\r\nI will begin my account of the river-sellers by enumerating the\r\nnumerous classes of labourers, amounting to many thousands, who get\r\ntheir living by plying their respective avocations on the river, and\r\nwho constitute the customers of these men. There are first the sailors\r\non board the corn, coal, and timber ships; then the “lumpers,” or\r\nthose engaged in discharging the timber ships; the “stevedores,” or\r\nthose engaged in stowing craft; and the “riggers,” or those engaged\r\nin rigging them; ballast-heavers, ballast-getters, corn-porters,\r\ncoal-whippers, watermen and lightermen, and coal-porters, who, although\r\nengaged in carrying sacks of coal from the barges or ships at the\r\nriver’s side to the shore, where there are public-houses, nevertheless,\r\nwhen hard worked and pressed for time, frequently avail themselves of\r\nthe presence of the purl-man to quench their thirst, and to stimulate\r\nthem to further exertion.\r\n\r\nIt would be a remarkable circumstance if the fact of so many persons\r\ncontinually employed in severe labour, and who, of course, are at\r\ntimes in want of refreshment, had not called into existence a class to\r\nsupply that which was evidently required; under one form or the other,\r\ntherefore, river-dealers boast of an antiquity as old as the naval\r\ncommerce of the country.\r\n\r\nThe prototype of the river beer-seller of the present day is the\r\nbumboat-man. Bumboats (or rather _Baum_-boats, that is to say, the\r\nboats of the harbour, from the German _Baum_, a haven or bar) are known\r\nin every port where ships are obliged to anchor at a distance from the\r\nshore. They are stored with a large assortment of articles, such as are\r\nlikely to be required by people after a long voyage. Previously to the\r\nformation of the various docks on the Thames, they were very numerous\r\non the river, and drove a good trade with the homeward-bound shipping.\r\nBut since the docks came into requisition, and steam-tugs brought the\r\nships from the mouth of the river to the dock entrance, their business\r\ndied away, and they gradually disappeared; so that a bumboat on the\r\nThames at the present day would be a sort of curiosity, a relic of\r\ntimes past.\r\n\r\nIn former times it was _not_ in the power of any person who chose to\r\nfollow the calling of a bumboat man on the Thames. The Trinity Company\r\nhad the power of granting licences for this purpose. Whether they were\r\nrestrained by some special clause in their charter, or not, from giving\r\nlicences indiscriminately, it is difficult to say. But it is certain\r\nthat none got a licence but a sailor--one who had “served his country;”\r\nand it was quite common in those days to see an old fellow with a pair\r\nof wooden legs, perhaps blind of an eye, or wanting an arm, and with\r\na face rugged as a rock, plying about among the shipping, accompanied\r\nby a boy whose duty it was to carry the articles to the purchasers on\r\nshipboard, and help in the management of the boat. In the first or\r\nsecond year of the reign of her present Majesty, however, when the\r\noriginal bumboat-men had long degenerated into the mere beer-sellers,\r\nand any one who wished traded in this line on the river (the Trinity\r\nCompany having for many years paid no attention to the matter), an\r\ninquiry took place, which resulted in a regulation that all the\r\nbeer-sellers or purl-men should thenceforward be regularly licensed\r\nfor the river-sale of beer and spirits from the Waterman’s Hall, which\r\nregulation is in force to the present time.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been the practice at some time or other in this\r\ncountry to infuse wormwood into beer or ale previous to drinking it,\r\neither to make it sufficiently bitter, or for some medicinal purpose.\r\nThis mixture was called _purl_--why I know not, but Bailey, the\r\nphilologist of the seventeenth century, so designates it. The drink\r\noriginally sold on the river was purl, or this mixture, whence the\r\ntitle, purl-man. Now, however, the wormwood is unknown; and what is\r\nsold under the name of purl is beer warmed nearly to boiling heat, and\r\nflavoured with gin, sugar, and ginger. The river-sellers, however,\r\nstill retain the name, of _purl_-men, though there is not one of them\r\nwith whom I have conversed that has the remotest idea of the meaning of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTo set up as a purl-man, some acquaintance with the river, and a\r\ncertain degree of skill in the management of a boat, are absolutely\r\nnecessary; as, from the frequently-crowded state of the pool, and\r\nthe rapidity with which the steamers pass and repass, twisting and\r\nwriggling their way through craft of every description, the unskilful\r\nadventurer would run in continual danger of having his boat crushed\r\nlike a nutshell. The purl-men, however, through long practice, are\r\nscarcely inferior to the watermen themselves in the management of their\r\nboats; and they may be seen at all times easily working their way\r\nthrough every obstruction, now shooting athwart the bows of a Dutch\r\ngalliot or sailing-barge, then dropping astern to allow a steam-boat\r\nto pass till they at length reach the less troubled waters between the\r\ntiers of shipping.\r\n\r\nThe first thing required to become a purl-man is to procure a licence\r\nfrom the Waterman’s Hall, which costs 3_s._ 6_d._ per annum. The next\r\nrequisite is the possession of a boat. The boats used are all in the\r\nform of skiffs, rather short, but of a good breadth, and therefore\r\nless liable to capsize through the swell of the steamers, or through\r\nany other cause. Thus equipped he then goes to some of the small\r\nbreweries, where he gets two “pins,” or small casks of beer, each\r\ncontaining eighteen pots; after this he furnishes himself with a quart\r\nor two of gin from some publican, which he carries in a tin vessel\r\nwith a long neck, like a bottle--an iron or tin vessel to hold the\r\nfire, with holes drilled all round to admit the air and keep the fuel\r\nburning, and a huge bell, by no means the least important portion of\r\nhis fit out. Placing his two pins of beer on a frame in the stern of\r\nthe boat, the spiles loosened and the brass cocks fitted in, and with\r\nhis tin gin bottle close to his hand beneath the seat, two or three\r\nmeasures of various sizes, a black tin pot for heating the beer, and\r\nhis fire pan secured on the bottom of the boat, and sending up a black\r\nsmoke, he takes his seat early in the morning and pulls away from\r\nthe shore, resting now and then on his oars, to ring the heavy bell\r\nthat announces his approach. Those on board the vessels requiring\r\nrefreshment, when they hear the bell, hail “Purl ahoy;” in an instant\r\nthe oars are resumed, and the purl-man is quickly alongside the ship.\r\n\r\nThe bell of the purl-man not unfrequently performs another very\r\nimportant office. During the winter, when dense fogs settle down on\r\nthe river, even the regular watermen sometimes lose themselves, and\r\nflounder about bewildered perhaps for hours. The direction once lost,\r\ntheir shouting is unheeded or unheard. The purl-man’s bell, however,\r\nreaches the ear through the surrounding gloom, and indicates his\r\nposition; when near enough to hear the hail of his customers, he makes\r\nhis way unerringly to the spot by now and then sounding his bell; this\r\nis immediately answered by another shout, so that in a short time the\r\nglare of his fire may be distinguished as he emerges from the darkness,\r\nand glides noiselessly alongside the ship where he is wanted.\r\n\r\nThe amount of capital necessary to start in the purl line may\r\nbe as follows:--I have said that the boats are all of the skiff\r\nkind--generally old ones, which they patch up and repair at but little\r\ncost. They purchase these boats at from 3_l._ to 6_l._ each. If we take\r\nthe average of these two sums, the items will be--\r\n\r\n                     £  _s._ _d._\r\n  Boat               4   10   0\r\n  Pewter measures    0    5   0\r\n  Warming-pot        0    1   6\r\n  Fire stove         0    5   0\r\n  Gallon can         0    2   6\r\n  Two pins of beer   0    8   0\r\n  Quart of gin       0    2   6\r\n  Sugar and ginger   0    1   0\r\n  Licence            0    3   6\r\n                    -----------\r\n              Total £5   19   0\r\n\r\nThus it requires, at the very least, a capital of 6_l._ to set up as a\r\npurl-man.\r\n\r\nSince the Waterman’s Hall has had the granting of licences, there have\r\nbeen upwards of 140 issued; but out of the possessors of these many are\r\ndead, some have left for other business, and others are too old and\r\nfeeble to follow the occupation any longer, so that out of the whole\r\nnumber there remain only 35 purl-men on the river, and these are thus\r\ndivided:--23 ply their trade in what is called “the pool,” that is,\r\nfrom Execution Dock to Ratcliff Cross, among the coal-laden ships, and\r\ndo a tolerable business amongst the sailors and the hard-working and\r\nthirsty coal-whippers; 8 purl-men follow their calling from Execution\r\nDock to London Bridge, and sell their commodity among the ships loaded\r\nwith corn, potatoes, &c.; and 4 are known to frequent the various\r\nreaches below Limehouse Hole, where the colliers are obliged to lie at\r\ntimes in sections, waiting till they are sold on the Coal Exchange,\r\nand some even go down the river as far as the ballast-lighters of the\r\nTrinity Company, for the purpose of supplying the ballast-getters. The\r\npurl-men cannot sell much to the unfortunate ballast-heavers, for they\r\nare suffering under all the horrors of an abominable truck system, and\r\nare compelled to take from the publicans about Wapping and Shadwell,\r\nwho are their employers, large quantities of filthy stuff compounded\r\nespecially for their use, for which they are charged exorbitant prices,\r\nbeing thus and in a variety of other ways mercilessly robbed of their\r\nearnings, so that they and their families are left in a state of almost\r\nutter destitution. One of the purl-men, whose boat is No. 44, has hoops\r\nlike those used by gipsies for pitching their tents; these he fastens\r\nto each side of the boat, over which he draws a tarred canvas covering,\r\nwater-proof, and beneath this he sleeps the greater part of the year,\r\nseldom going ashore except for the purpose of getting a fresh supply\r\nof liquors for trade, or food for himself. He generally casts anchor\r\nin some unfrequented nook down the river, where he enjoys all the\r\nquiet of a Thames hermit, after the labour of the day. To obtain the\r\nnecessary heat during the winter, he fits a funnel to his fire-stove to\r\ncarry away the smoke, and thus warmed he sleeps away in defiance of the\r\nseverest weather.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the facts above given that 210_l._ is the gross amount\r\nof capital employed in this business. On an average all the year round\r\neach purl-man sells two “pins” of beer weekly, independent of gin; but\r\nlittle gin is thus sold in the summer, but in the winter a considerable\r\nquantity of it is used in making the purl. The men purchase the beer at\r\n4_s._ per pin, and sell it at 4_d._ per pot, which leaves them a profit\r\nof 4_s._ on the two pins, and, allowing them 6_d._ per day profit on\r\nthe gin, it gives 1_l._ 7_s._ per week profit to each, or a total to\r\nall hands of 47_l._ 5_s._ per week, and a gross total of 2457_l._\r\nprofit made on the sale of 98,280 gallons of beer, beside gin sold on\r\nthe Thames in the course of the year. From this amount must be deducted\r\n318_l._ 10_s._, which is paid to boys, at the rate of 3_s._ 6_d._ per\r\nweek; it being necessary for each purl-man to employ a lad to take care\r\nof the boat while he is on board the ships serving his customers, or\r\ntraversing the tiers. This deduction being made leaves 61_l._ 2_s._ per\r\nannum to each purl-man as the profit on his year’s trading.\r\n\r\nThe present race of purl-men, unlike the weather-beaten tars who\r\nin former times alone were licensed, are generally young men, who\r\nhave been in the habit of following some river employment, and who,\r\neither from some accident having befallen them in the course of their\r\nwork, or from their preferring the easier task of sitting in their\r\nboat and rowing leisurely about to continuous labour, have started in\r\nthe line, and ultimately superseded the old river dealers. This is\r\neasily explained. No man labouring on the river would purchase from a\r\nstranger when he knew that his own fellow-workman was afloat, and was\r\nprepared to serve him with as good an article; besides he might not\r\nhave money, and a stranger could not be expected to give trust, but his\r\nold acquaintance would make little scruple in doing so. In this way\r\nthe customers of the purl-men are secured; and many of these people do\r\nso much more than the average amount of business above stated, that it\r\nis no unusual thing to see some of them, after four or five years on\r\nthe river, take a public-house, spring up into the rank of licensed\r\nvictuallers, and finally become men of substance.\r\n\r\nI conversed with one who had been a coal-whipper. He stated that he had\r\nmet with an accident while at work which prevented him from following\r\ncoal-whipping any longer. He had fallen from the ship’s side into a\r\nbarge, and was for a long time in the hospital. When he came out he\r\nfound he could not work, and had no other prospect before him but the\r\nunion. “I thought I’d be by this time toes up in Stepney churchyard,”\r\nhe said, “and grinning at the lid of an old coffin.” In this extremity\r\na neighbour, a waterman, who had long known him, advised him to take\r\nto the purl business, and gave him not only the advice, but sufficient\r\nmoney to enable him to put it in practice. The man accordingly got a\r\nboat, and was soon afloat among his old workmates. In this line he now\r\nmakes out a living for himself and his family, and reckons himself able\r\nto clear, one week with the other, from 18_s._ to 20_s._ “I should do\r\nmuch better,” he said, “if people would only pay what they owe; but\r\nthere are some who never think of paying anything.” He has between\r\n10_l._ and 20_l._ due to him, and never expects to get a farthing of it.\r\n\r\nThe following is the form of licence issued by the Watermen’s Company:--\r\n\r\n  INCORPORATED 1827.\r\n\r\n  BUMBOAT.\r\n\r\n  Height 5 feet 8          }\r\n  inches, 30 years         }\r\n  of age, dark             }\r\n  hair, sallow complexion. }\r\n                           }\r\n  2nd & 3rd Vic.           }\r\n    cap. 47, sec. 25.      }\r\n\r\n I hereby certify that      of     , in the parish of      in the\r\n county of Middlesex, is this day registered in a book of the Company\r\n of the Master, Wardens, and Commonalty of Watermen and Lightermen of\r\n the river Thames, kept for that purpose, to use, work, or navigate\r\n a boat called a skiff, named     , number     , for the purpose of\r\n selling, disposing of, or exposing for sale to and amongst the seamen,\r\n or other persons employed in and about any of the ships or vessels\r\n upon the said river, any liquors, slops, or other articles whatsoever,\r\n between London Bridge and Limehouse Hole; but the said boat is not to\r\n be used on the said river for any other purpose than the aforesaid.\r\n\r\n Waterman’s Hall,\r\n\r\n  JAS. BANYON, _Clerk_.\r\n\r\nBeside the regular purl-men, or, as they may be called, bumboat-men,\r\nthere are two or three others who, perhaps unable to purchase a boat,\r\nand take out the licence, have nevertheless for a number of years\r\ncontrived to carry on a traffic in spirits among the ships in the\r\nThames. Their practice is to carry a flat tin bottle concealed about\r\ntheir person, with which they go on board the first ship in a tier,\r\nwhere they are well known by those who may be there employed. If the\r\nseamen wish for any spirit the river-vendor immediately supplies it,\r\nentering the name of the customers served, as none of the vendors ever\r\nreceive, at the time of sale, any money for what they dispose of; they\r\nkeep an account till their customers receive their wages, when they\r\nalways contrive to be present, and in general succeed in getting what\r\nis owing to them. What their profits are it is impossible to tell,\r\nperhaps they may equal those of the regular purl-man, for they go on\r\nboard of almost every ship in the course of the day. When their tin\r\nbottle is empty they go on shore to replenish it, doing so time after\r\ntime if necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that although these people are perfectly well known to\r\nevery purl-man on the river, who have seen them day by day, for many\r\nyears going on board the various ships, and are thoroughly cognizant\r\nof the purpose of their visits, there has never been any information\r\nlaid against them, nor have they been in any way interrupted in their\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThere is one of these river spirit-sellers who has pursued the\r\navocation for the greater part of his life; he is a native of the\r\nsouth of Ireland, now very old, and a little shrivelled-up man. He may\r\nstill be seen every day, going from ship to ship by scrambling over\r\nthe quarters where they are lashed together in tiers--a feat sometimes\r\nattended with danger to the young and strong; yet he works his way\r\nwith the agility of a man of 20, gets on board the ship he wants, and\r\nwhen there, were he not so well known, he might be thought to be some\r\nofficial sent to take an inventory of the contents of the ship, for he\r\nhas at all times an ink-bottle hanging from one of his coat buttons, a\r\npen stuck over his ear, spectacles on his nose, a book in his hand, and\r\nreally has all the appearance of a man determined on doing business of\r\nsome sort or other. He possesses a sort of ubiquity, for go where you\r\nwill through any part of the pool you are sure to meet him. He seems to\r\nbe expected everywhere; no one appears to be surprised at his presence.\r\nCaptains and mates pass him by unnoticed and unquestioned. As suddenly\r\nas he comes does he disappear, to start up in some other place. His\r\nvisits are so regular, that it would scarcely look like being on board\r\nship if “old D----, the whiskey man,” as he is called, did not make his\r\nappearance some time during the day, for he seems to be in some strange\r\nway identified with the river, and with every ship that frequents it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE NUMBERS, CAPITAL, AND INCOME OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF\r\nSECOND-HAND ARTICLES, LIVE ANIMALS, MINERAL PRODUCTIONS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hawkers of second-hand articles, live animals, mineral productions,\r\nand natural curiosities, form, as we have seen, large important\r\nclasses of the street-sellers. According to the facts already given,\r\nthere appear to be at present in the streets, 90 sellers of metal\r\nwares, including the sellers of second-hand trays and Italian-irons;\r\n30 sellers of old linen, as wrappers and towelling; 80 vendors of\r\nsecond-hand (burnt) linen and calico; 30 sellers of curtains; 30\r\nsellers of carpeting, &c.; 30 sellers of bed-ticking, &c.; 6 sellers\r\nof old crockery and glass; 25 sellers of old musical instruments;\r\n6 vendors of second-hand weapons; 6 sellers of old curiosities; 6\r\nvendors of telescopes and pocket glasses; 30 to 40 sellers of other\r\nmiscellaneous second-hand articles; 100 sellers of men’s second-hand\r\nclothes; 30 sellers of old boots and shoes; 15 vendors of old hats;\r\n50 sellers of women’s second-hand apparel; 30 vendors of second-hand\r\nbonnets, and 10 sellers of old furs; 116 sellers of second-hand\r\narticles at Smithfield-market;--making altogether 725 street-sellers of\r\nsecond-hand commodities.\r\n\r\nBut some of the above trades are of a temporary character only, as in\r\nthe case of the vendors of old linen towelling or wrappers, carpets,\r\nbed-ticking, &c.--the same persons who sell the one often selling the\r\nothers; the towels and wrappers, moreover, are offered for sale only on\r\nthe Monday and Saturday nights. Assuming, then, that upwards of 100 or\r\none-sixth of the above number sell two different second-hand articles,\r\nor are not continually employed at that department of street-traffic,\r\nwe find the total number of street-sellers belonging to this class to\r\nbe about 500.\r\n\r\nConcerning the number selling live animals in the streets, there are\r\n50 men vending fancy and sporting dogs; 200 sellers and “duffers”\r\nof English birds; 10 sellers of parrots and other foreign birds; 3\r\nsellers of birds’-nests, &c.; 20 vendors of squirrels; 6 sellers of\r\nleverets and wild rabbits; 35 vendors of gold and silver fish; 20\r\nvendors of tortoises; and 14 sellers of snails, frogs, worms, &c.; or,\r\nallowing for the temporary and mixed character of many of these trades,\r\nwe may say that there are 200 constantly engaged in this branch of\r\nstreet-commerce.\r\n\r\nThen of the street-sellers of mineral productions and natural\r\ncuriosities, there are 216 vendors of coals; 1500 sellers of coke;\r\n14 sellers of tan-turf; 150 vendors of salt; 70 sellers of sand; 26\r\nsellers of shells; or 1969 in all. From this number the sellers of\r\nshells must be deducted, as the shell-trade is not a special branch of\r\nstreet-traffic. We may, therefore, assert that the number of people\r\nengaged in this latter class of street-business amounts to about 1900.\r\n\r\nNow, adding all these sums together, we have the following table as to\r\nthe numbers of individuals comprised in the _first_ division of the\r\nLondon street-folk, viz. the street-sellers:--\r\n\r\n    1. Costermongers (including men,\r\n  women, and children engaged in the\r\n  sale of fish, fruit, vegetables, game,\r\n  poultry, flowers, &c.)                           30,000\r\n    2. Street-sellers of “green stuff,”\r\n  including water-cresses, chickweed\r\n  and gru’n’sel, turf, &c.                          2,000\r\n    3. Street-sellers of eatables and\r\n  drinkables                                        4,000\r\n    4. Street-sellers of stationery, literature,\r\n  and fine arts                                     1,000\r\n    5. Street-sellers of manufactured\r\n  articles of metal, crockery, glass, textile,\r\n  chemical, and miscellaneous substances            4,000\r\n    6. Street-sellers of second-hand\r\n  articles, including the sellers of old\r\n  metal articles, old glass, old linen, old\r\n  clothes, old shoes, &c.                             500\r\n    7. Street-sellers of live animals, as\r\n  dogs, birds, gold and silver fish, squirrels,\r\n  leverets, tortoises, snails, &c.                    200\r\n    8. Street-sellers of mineral productions\r\n  and natural curiosities, as coals,\r\n  coke, tan-turf, salt, sand, shells, &c.            1,900\r\n                                                    ______\r\n    TOTAL NUMBER OF STREET-SELLERS                  43,640\r\n\r\nThese numbers, it should be remembered, are given rather as an\r\napproximation to the truth than as the absolute fact. It would\r\ntherefore be safer to say, making all due allowance for the temporary\r\nand mixed character of many branches of street-commerce, that there\r\nare about 40,000 people engaged in selling articles in the streets\r\nof London. I am induced to believe that this is very near the real\r\nnumber of street-sellers, from the _wholesale_ returns of the places\r\nwhere the street-sellers purchase their goods, and which I have always\r\nmade a point of collecting from the best authorities connected with\r\nthe various branches of street-traffic. The statistics of the fish\r\nand green markets, the swag-shops, the old clothes exchange, the\r\nbird-dealers, which I have caused to be collected for the first time in\r\nthis country, all tend to corroborate this estimate.\r\n\r\nThe next fact to be evolved is the amount of capital invested in the\r\nstreet-sale of Second-hand Articles, of Live Animals, and of Mineral\r\nProductions. And, first, as to the money employed in the Second-hand\r\nStreet-Trade.\r\n\r\nThe following tables will show the amount of capital invested in this\r\nbranch of street-business.\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Metal Wares._\r\n\r\n  30 stalls, 5_s._ each; 20 barrows, 1_l._         £  _s._  _d._\r\n  each; stock-money for 50 vendors, at\r\n  10_s._ per head                                 52   10     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Metal Trays._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 20 sellers, at 5_s._             5    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of other Second-hand Metal Articles,\r\n  as Italian and Flat Irons._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 20 vendors, at 5_s._\r\n  each; 20 stalls, at 3_s._ each                   8    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Linen, &c._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 30 vendors, at 5_s._ per head    7   10     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand (burnt) Linen and\r\n  Calico._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 80 vendors, at 10_s._ each      40    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Curtains._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 30 sellers, at 5_s._ each        7   10     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Carpeting, Flannels,\r\n  Stocking-legs, &c._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 30 sellers, at 6_s._ each        9    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Bed-ticking,\r\n  Sacking, Fringe, &c._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 30 sellers, at 4_s._ each        6    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Glass and Crockery._\r\n\r\n  6 barrows, 15_s._ each; 6 baskets,\r\n  1_s._ 6_d._ each; stock-money for 6 vendors,\r\n  at 5_s._ each                                    6    9     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Miscellaneous\r\n  Articles._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 5 vendors, at 15_s._ each        3   15     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers and Duffers of Second-hand Music._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 25 sellers, at 1_l._ each       25    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Weapons._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 6 vendors, at 1_l._ each         6    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Curiosities._\r\n\r\n  6 barrows, 15_s._ each; stock-money\r\n  for 6 vendors, at 15_s._ per head                9    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Telescopes and\r\n  Pocket-Glasses._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 6 vendors, at 4_l._ each        24    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of other Miscellaneous Articles._\r\n\r\n  30 stalls, 5_s._ each; stock-money for\r\n  30 sellers, at 15_s._ each                      30    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Men’s Second-hand Clothes._\r\n\r\n  100 linen bags, at 2_s._ each; stock-money\r\n  for 100 sellers, at 15_s._ each                 85    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Boots and Shoes._\r\n\r\n  10 stalls, at 3_s._ each; 30 baskets, at\r\n  2_s._ 6_d._ each; stock-money for 30\r\n  sellers, at 10_s._ each                         20    5     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Hats._\r\n\r\n  30 irons, two to each man, at 2_s._ each;\r\n  60 blocks, at 1_s._ 6_d._ per block; stock-money\r\n  for 15 vendors, at 10_s._ each                  15    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Women’s Second-hand Apparel._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 50 sellers, at 10_s._\r\n  each; 50 baskets, at 2_s._ 6_d._ each           31    5     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Bonnets._\r\n\r\n  10 umbrellas, at 3_s._ each; 30 baskets,\r\n  at 2_s._ 6_d._ each; stock-money\r\n  for 30 sellers, at 5_s._ each                   12   15     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Furs._\r\n\r\n  Stock-money for 10 vendors, at\r\n  7_s._ 6_d._ each                                 3   15     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Articles in\r\n  Smithfield-market._\r\n\r\n  30 sellers of harness sets and collars,\r\n  at an average capital of 15_s._ each;\r\n  6 sellers of saddles and pads, at 15_s._\r\n  each; 10 sellers of bits, at 3_s._ each; 6\r\n  sellers of wheel-springs and trays, at\r\n  15_s._ each; 6 sellers of boards and\r\n  trestles for stalls, at 10_s._ each; 20\r\n  sellers of barrows, small carts, and\r\n  trucks, at 5_l._ each; 6 sellers of goat\r\n  carriages, at 3_l._ each; 6 sellers of\r\n  shooting galleries and guns for ditto,\r\n  and drums for costers, at 15_s._ each;\r\n  10 sellers of measures, weights, and\r\n  scales, at 25_s._ each; 5 sellers of potato\r\n  cans and roasted-chestnut apparatus,\r\n  at 5_l._ each; 3 sellers of ginger-beer\r\n  trucks, at 5_l._ each; 6 sellers of\r\n  pea-soup cans and pickled-eel kettles,\r\n  15_s._ each; 2 sellers of elder-wine\r\n  vessels, at 15_s._ each.

The average takings of\r\n  this class of street-sellers are about\r\n  12_s._ each per week, and their clear gains\r\n  not more than one-half, thus giving a\r\n  yearly expenditure of                          936    0     0\r\n\r\n  _Street-Sellers of Second-hand Furs._\r\n\r\n  During five months of the year there\r\n  are as many as 8 or 12 persons who\r\n  sell furs in the street-markets on\r\n  Saturday nights, Sunday mornings,\r\n  and Monday nights.

The largest, and, in every\r\nrespect, the most remarkable body of these traders, are the buyers of\r\nold clothes, and of them I shall speak separately, devoting at the same\r\ntime some space to the STREET-JEWS. It will also be necessary to give\r\na brief account of the Jews generally, for they are still a peculiar\r\nrace, and street and shop-trading among them are in many respects\r\nclosely blended.\r\n\r\nThe principal things bought by the itinerant purchasers consist of\r\nwaste-paper, hare and rabbit skins, old umbrellas and parasols, bottles\r\nand glass, broken metal, rags, dripping, grease, bones, tea-leaves, and\r\nold clothes.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the buyers of waste-paper, among whom are many\r\nactive, energetic, and intelligent men, the street-buyers are of\r\nthe lower sort, both as to means and intelligence. The only further\r\nexception, perhaps, which I need notice here is, that among some\r\numbrella-buyers, there is considerable smartness, and sometimes, in\r\nthe repair or renewal of the ribs, &c., a slight degree of skill. The\r\nother street-purchasers--such as the hare-skin and old metal and rag\r\nbuyers, are often old and infirm people of both sexes, of whom--perhaps\r\nby reason of their infirmities--not a few have been in the trade from\r\ntheir childhood, and are as well known by sight in their respective\r\nrounds, as was the “long-remembered beggar” in former times.\r\n\r\nIt is usually the lot of a poor person who has been driven to the\r\nstreets, or has adopted such a life when an adult, to _sell_ trifling\r\nthings--such as are light to carry and require a small outlay--in\r\nadvanced age. Old men and women totter about offering lucifer-matches,\r\nboot and stay-laces, penny memorandum books, and such like. But the\r\nelder portion of the street-folk I have now to speak of do not sell,\r\nbut _buy_. The street-seller commends his wares, their cheapness, and\r\nexcellence. The same sort of man, when a buyer, depreciates everything\r\noffered to him, in order to ensure a cheaper bargain, while many of\r\nthe things thus obtained find their way into street-sale, and are then\r\nas much commended for cheapness and goodness, as if they were the\r\nstock-in-trade of an acute slop advertisement-monger, and this is done\r\nsometimes by the very man who, when a buyer, condemned them as utterly\r\nvalueless. But this is common to all trades.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-BUYERS OF RAGS, BROKEN METAL, BOTTLES, GLASS, AND BONES.\r\n\r\nI class all these articles under one head, for, on inquiry, I find no\r\nindividual supporting himself by the trading in any one of them. I\r\nshall, therefore, describe the buyers of rags, broken metal, bottles,\r\nglass, and bones, as a body of street-traders, but take the articles in\r\nwhich they traffic seriatim, pointing out in what degree they are, or\r\nhave been, wholly or partially, the staple of several distinct callings.\r\n\r\nThe traders in these things are not unprosperous men. The poor\r\ncreatures who may be seen picking up rags in the street are\r\n“street-finders,” and not buyers. It is the same with the poor old men\r\nwho may be seen bending under an unsavoury sack of bones. The bones\r\nhave been found, or have been given for charity, and are not purchased.\r\nOne feeble old man whom I met with, his eyes fixed on the middle of\r\nthe carriage-way in the Old St. Pancras-road, and with whom I had some\r\nconversation, told me that the best friend he had in the world was a\r\ngentleman who lived in a large house near the Regent’s-park, and gave\r\nhim the bones which his dogs had done with! “If I can only see hisself,\r\nsir,” said the old man, “he’s sure to give me any coppers he has in\r\nhis coat-pocket, and that’s a very great thing to a poor man like me.\r\nO, yes, I’ll buy bones, if I have any ha’pence, rather than go without\r\nthem; but I pick them up, or have them given to me mostly.”\r\n\r\nThe street-buyers, who are only buyers, have barrows, sometimes even\r\ncarts with donkeys, and, as they themselves describe it, they “buy\r\neverything.” These men are little seen in London, for they “work” the\r\nmore secluded courts, streets, and alleys, when in town; but their most\r\nfrequented rounds are the poorer parts of the populous suburbs. There\r\nare many in Croydon, Woolwich, Greenwich, and Deptford. “It’s no use,”\r\na man who had been in the trade said to me, “such as us calling at fine\r\nhouses to know if they’ve any old keys to sell! No, we trades with the\r\npoor.” Often, however, they deal with the servants of the wealthy; and\r\ntheir usual mode of business in such cases is to leave a bill at the\r\nhouse a few hours previous to their visit. This document has frequently\r\nthe royal arms at the head of it, and asserts that the “firm” has been\r\nestablished since the year ----, which is seldom less than half a\r\ncentury. The hand-bill usually consists of a short preface as to the\r\nincreased demand for rags on the part of the paper-makers, and this is\r\nfollowed by a liberal offer to give the very best prices for any old\r\nlinen, or old metal, bottles, rope, stair-rods, locks, keys, dripping,\r\ncarpeting, &c., “in fact, no rubbish or lumber, however worthless, will\r\nbe refused;” and generally concludes with a request that this “bill”\r\nmay be shown to the mistress of the house and preserved, as it will be\r\ncalled for in a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nThe papers are delivered by one of the “firm,” who marks on the door\r\na sign indicative of the houses at which the bill has been taken in,\r\nand the probable reception there of the gentleman who is to follow him.\r\nThe road taken is also pointed by marks before explained, see vol. i.\r\npp. 218 and 247. These men are residents in all quarters within 20\r\nmiles of London, being most numerous in the places at no great distance\r\nfrom the Thames. They work their way from their suburban residences\r\nto London, which, of course, is the mart, or “exchange,” for their\r\nwares. The reason why the suburbs are preferred is that in those parts\r\nthe possessors of such things as broken metal, &c., cannot so readily\r\nresort to a marine-store dealer’s as they can in town. I am informed,\r\nhowever, that the shops of the marine-store men are on the increase in\r\nthe more densely-peopled suburbs; still the dwellings of the poor are\r\noften widely scattered in those parts, and few will go a mile to sell\r\nany old thing. They wait in preference, unless very needy, for the\r\n_visit_ of the street-buyer.\r\n\r\nA good many years ago--perhaps until 30 years back--_rags_, and\r\nespecially white and good linen rags, were among the things most\r\nzealously inquired for by street-buyers, and then 3_d._ a pound was a\r\nprice readily paid. Subsequently the paper-manufacturers brought to\r\ngreat and economical perfection the process of boiling rags in lye and\r\nbleaching them with chlorine, so that colour became less a desideratum.\r\nA few years after the peace of 1815, moreover, the foreign trade in\r\nrags increased rapidly. At the present time, about 1200 tons of woollen\r\nrags, and upwards of 10,000 tons of linen rags, are imported yearly.\r\nThese 10,000 tons give us but a vague notion of the real amount. I may\r\ntherefore mention that, when reduced to a more definite quantity, they\r\nshow a total of no less than twenty-two millions four hundred thousand\r\npounds. The woollen rags are imported the most largely from Hamburg\r\nand Bremen, the price being from 5_l._ to 17_l._ the ton. Linen rags,\r\nwhich average nearly 20_l._ the ton, are imported from the same places,\r\nand from several Italian ports, more especially those in Sicily. Among\r\nthese ports are Palermo, Messina, Ancona, Leghorn, and Trieste (the\r\nTrieste rags being gathered in Hungary). The value of the rags annually\r\nbrought to this country is no less than 200,000_l._ What the native\r\nrags may be worth, there are no facts on which to ground an estimate;\r\nbut supposing each person of the 20,000,000 in Great Britain to produce\r\none pound of rags annually, then the rags of this country may be valued\r\nat very nearly the same price as the foreign ones, so that the gross\r\nvalue of the rags of Great Britain imported and produced at home,\r\nwould, in such a case, amount to 400,000_l._ From France, Belgium,\r\nHolland, Spain, and other continental kingdoms, the exportation of rags\r\nis prohibited, nor can so bulky and low-priced a commodity be smuggled\r\nto advantage.\r\n\r\nOf this large sum of rags, which is independent of what is collected in\r\nthe United Kingdom, the Americans are purchasers on an extensive scale.\r\nThe wear of cotton is almost unknown in many parts of Italy, Germany,\r\nand Hungary; and although the linen in use is coarse and, compared to\r\nthe Irish, Scotch, or English, rudely manufactured, the foreign rags\r\n_are_ generally linen, and therefore are preferred at the paper mills.\r\nThe street-buyers in this country, however, make less distinction than\r\never, as regards price, between linen and cotton rags.\r\n\r\nThe linen rag-buying is still prosecuted extensively by itinerant\r\n“gatherers” in the country, and in the further neighbourhoods of\r\nLondon, but the collection is not to the extent it was formerly. The\r\nprice is lower, and, owing to the foreign trade, the demand is less\r\nurgent; so common, too, is now the wear of cotton, and so much smaller\r\nthat of linen, that many people will not sell linen rags, but reserve\r\nthem for use in case of cuts and wounds, or for giving to their\r\npoor neighbours on any such emergency. This was done doubtlessly to\r\nas great, or to a greater extent, in the old times, but linen rags\r\nwere more plentiful then, for cotton shirting was not woven to the\r\nperfection seen at present, and many good country housewives spun their\r\nown linen sheetings and shirtings.\r\n\r\nA street-buyer of the class I have described, upon presenting himself\r\nat any house, offers to buy rags, broken metal, or glass, and for rags\r\nespecially there is often a serious bargaining, and sometimes, I was\r\ntold by an itinerant street-seller, who had been an ear-witness, a\r\nlittle joking not of the most delicate kind. For coloured rags these\r\nmen give 1/2_d._ a pound, or 1_d._ for three pounds; for inferior white\r\nrags 1/2_d._ a pound, and up to 1-1/2_d._; for the best, 2_d._ the\r\npound. It is common, however, and even more common, I am assured, among\r\nmasters of the old rag and bottle shops, than among street-buyers, to\r\nannounce 2_d._ or 3_d._, or even as much as 6_d._, for the _best_ rags,\r\nbut, somehow or other, the rags taken for sale to those buyers never\r\nare of the best. To offer 6_d._ a pound for rags is ridiculous, but\r\nsuch an offer may be seen at some rag-shops, the figure ~6~, perhaps,\r\ncrowning a painting of a large plum-pudding, as a representation of\r\nwhat may be a Christmas result, merely from the thrifty preservation\r\nof rags, grease, and dripping. Some of the street-buyers, when working\r\nthe suburbs or the country, attach a similar “illustration” to their\r\nbarrows or carts. I saw the winter placard of one of these men, which\r\nhe was reserving for a country excursion as far as Rochester, “when the\r\nplum-pudding time was a-coming.” In this pictorial advertisement a man\r\nand woman, very florid and full-faced, were on the point of enjoying a\r\nhuge plum-pudding, the man flourishing a large knife, and looking very\r\nhospitable. On a scroll which issued from his mouth were the words:\r\n“From our rags! The best prices given by ---- ----, of London.” The\r\nwoman in like manner exclaimed: “From dripping and house fat! The best\r\nprices given by ---- ----, of London.”\r\n\r\nThis man told me that at some times, both in town and country, he did\r\nnot buy a pound of rags in a week. He had heard the old hands in the\r\ntrade say, that 20 or 30 years back they could “gather” (the word\r\ngenerally used for buying) twice and three times as many rags as at\r\npresent. My informant attributed this change to two causes, depending\r\nmore upon what he had heard from experienced street-buyers than upon\r\nhis own knowledge. At one time it was common for a mistress to allow\r\nher maid-servant to “keep a rag-bag,” in which all refuse linen, &c.,\r\nwas collected for sale for the servant’s behoof; a privilege now rarely\r\naccorded. The other cause was that working-people’s wives had less\r\nmoney at their command now than they had formerly, so that instead of\r\ngathering a good heap for the man who called on them periodically,\r\nthey ran to a marine store-shop and sold them by one, two, and\r\nthree pennyworths at a time. This related to all the things in the\r\nstreet-buyer’s trade, as well as to rags.\r\n\r\n“I’ve known this trade ten years or so,” said my informant, “I was a\r\ncostermonger before that, and I work coster-work now in the summer,\r\nand buy things in the winter. Before Christmas is the best time for\r\nsecond-hand trade. When I set out on a country round--and I’ve gone as\r\nfar as Guildford and Maidstone, and St. Alban’s--I lays in as great a\r\nstock of glass and crocks as I can raise money for, or as my donkey\r\nor pony--I’ve had both, but I’m working a ass now--can drag without\r\ndistressing him. I swops my crocks for anythink in the second-hand way,\r\nand when I’ve got through them I buys outright, and so works my way\r\nback to London. I bring back what I’ve bought in the crates and hampers\r\nI’ve had to pack the crocks in. The first year as I started I got hold\r\nof a few very tidy rags, coloured things mostly. The Jew I sold ’em to\r\nwhen I got home again gave me more than I expected. O, lord no, not\r\nmore than I asked! He told me, too, that he’d buy any more I might\r\nhave, as they was wanted at some town not very far off, where there was\r\na call for them for patching quilts. I haven’t heard of a call for any\r\nthat way since. I get less and less rags every year, I think. Well, I\r\ncan’t say what I got last year; perhaps about two stone. No, none of\r\nthem was woollen. They’re things as people’s seldom satisfied with the\r\nprice for, is rags. I’ve bought muslin window curtains or frocks as was\r\nworn, and good for nothink but rags, but there always seems such a lot,\r\nand they weighs so light and comes to so little, that there’s sure to\r\nbe grumbling. I’ve sometimes bought a lot of old clothes, by the lump,\r\nor I’ve swopped crocks for them, and among them there’s frequently been\r\nthings as the Jew in Petticoat-lane, what I sells them to, has put o’\r\none side as rags. If I’d offered to give rag prices, them as I got\r\n’em of would have been offended, and have thought I wanted to cheat.\r\nWhen you get a lot at one go, and ’specially if it’s for crocks, you\r\nmust make the best of them. This for that, and t’other for t’other.\r\nI stay at the beer-shops and little inns in the country. Some of the\r\nlandlords looks very shy at one, if you’re a stranger, acause, if the\r\npolice detectives is after anythink, they go as hawkers, or barrowmen,\r\nor somethink that way.” [This statement as to the police is correct;\r\nbut the man did not know how it came to his knowledge; he had “heard of\r\nit,” he believed.] “I’ve very seldom slept in a common lodging-house.\r\nI’d rather sleep on my barrow.” [I have before had occasion to remark\r\nthe aversion of the costermonger class to sleep in low lodging-houses.\r\nThese men, almost always, and from the necessities of their calling,\r\nhave rooms of their own in London; so that, I presume, they hate\r\nto sleep _in public_, as the accommodation for repose in many a\r\nlodging-house may very well be called. At any rate the costermongers,\r\nof all classes of street-sellers, when on their country excursions,\r\nresort the least to the lodging-houses.] “The last round I had in the\r\ncountry, as far as Reading and Pangbourne, I was away about five weeks,\r\nI think, and came back a better man by a pound; that was all. I mean I\r\nhad 30 shillings’ worth of things to start with, and when I’d got back,\r\nand turned my rags, and old metal, and things into money, I had 50_s._\r\nTo be sure Jenny (the ass) and me lived well all the time, and I bought\r\na pair of half-boots and a pair of stockings at Reading, so it weren’t\r\nso bad. Yes, sir, there’s nothing I likes better than a turn into the\r\ncountry. It does one’s health good, if it don’t turn out so well for\r\nprofits as it might.”\r\n\r\nMy informant, the rag-dealer, belonged to the best order of\r\ncostermongers; one proof of this was in the evident care which he had\r\nbestowed on Jenny, his donkey. There were no loose hairs on her hide,\r\nand her harness was clean and whole, and I observed after a pause to\r\ntransact business on his round, that the animal held her head towards\r\nher master to be scratched, and was petted with a mouthful of green\r\ngrass and clover, which the costermonger had in a corner of his vehicle.\r\n\r\n_Tailor’s cuttings_, which consist of cloth, satin, lining materials,\r\nfustian, waistcoatings, silk, &c., are among the things which the\r\nstreet-buyers are the most anxious to become possessed of on a country\r\nround; for, as will be easily understood by those who have read the\r\naccounts before given of the Old Clothes Exchange, and of Petticoat and\r\nRosemary lanes, they are available for many purposes in London.\r\n\r\n_Dressmaker’s cuttings_ are also a portion of the street-buyer’s\r\ncountry traffic, but to no great extent, and hardly ever, I am told,\r\nunless the street-buyer, which is not often the case, be accompanied\r\non his round by his wife. In town, tailor’s cuttings are usually sold\r\nto the piece-brokers, who call or send men round to the shops or\r\nworkshops for the purpose of buying them, and it is the same with the\r\ndressmaker’s cuttings.\r\n\r\n_Old metal_, or _broken metal_, for I heard one appellation used as\r\nfrequently as the other, is bought by the same description of traders.\r\nThis trade, however, is prosecuted in town by the street-buyers more\r\nlargely than in the country, and so differs from the rag business. The\r\ncarriage of old iron bolts and bars is exceedingly cumbersome; nor can\r\nmetal be packed or stowed away like old clothes or rags. This makes\r\nthe street-buyer indifferent as to the collecting of what I heard one\r\nof them call “country iron.” By “metal” the street-folk often mean\r\ncopper (most especially), brass, or pewter, in contradistinction to\r\nthe cheaper substances of iron or lead. In the country they are most\r\nanxious to buy “metal;” whereas, in town, they as readily purchase\r\n“iron.” When the street-buyers give merely the worth of any metal by\r\nweight to be disposed of, in order to be re-melted, or re-wrought\r\nin some manner, by the manufacturers, the following are the average\r\nprices:--Copper, 6_d._ per lb.; pewter, 5_d._; brass, 5_d._; iron, 6\r\nlbs. for 1_d._, and 8 lbs. for 2_d._ (a smaller quantity than 6 lbs. is\r\nseldom bought); and 1_d._ and 1-1/4_d._ per lb. for lead. Old zinc is\r\nnot a metal which “comes in the way” of the street-buyer, nor--as one\r\nof them told me with a laugh--old silver. Tin is never bought by weight\r\nin the streets.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the prices I have mentioned are those given\r\nfor old or broken metal, valueless unless for re-working. When an old\r\nmetal article is still available, or may be easily made available,\r\nfor the use for which it was designed, the street-purchase is by “the\r\npiece,” rather than the weight.\r\n\r\nThe broken pans, scuttles, kettles, &c., concerning one of the uses\r\nof which I have quoted Mr. Babbage, in page 6 of the present volume,\r\nas to the conversion of these worn-out vessels into the light and\r\njapanned edgings, or clasps, called “clamps,” or “clips,” by the\r\ntrunk-makers, and used to protect or strengthen the corners of boxes\r\nand packing-cases, are purchased sometimes by the street-buyers, but\r\nfall more properly under the head of what constitutes a portion of the\r\nstock-in-trade of the street-finder. They are not bought by weight,\r\nbut so much for the pan, perhaps so much along with other things;\r\na halfpenny, a penny, or occasionally two-pence, and often only a\r\nfarthing, or three pans for a penny. The uses for these things which\r\nthe street-buyers have more especially in view, are not those mentioned\r\nby Mr. Babbage (the trunk clamps), but the conversion of them into the\r\n“iron shovels,” or strong dust-pans sold in the streets. One street\r\nartisan supports himself and his family by the making of dust-pans from\r\nsuch grimy old vessels.\r\n\r\nAs in the result of my inquiry among the street-_sellers_ of old\r\nmetal, I am of opinion that the street-_buyers_ also are not generally\r\nmixed up with the receipt of stolen goods. That they may be so to some\r\nextent is probable enough; in the same proportion, perhaps, as highly\r\nrespectable tradesmen have been known to buy the goods of fraudulent\r\nbankrupts, and others. The street-buyers are low itinerants, seen\r\nregularly by the police and easy to be traced, and therefore, for\r\none reason, cautious. In one of my inquiries among the young thieves\r\nand pickpockets in the low lodging-houses, I heard frequent accounts\r\nof their selling the metal goods they stole, to “fences,” and in one\r\nparticular instance, to the mistress of a lodging-house, who had\r\nconveniences for the melting of pewter pots (called “cats and kittens”\r\nby the young thieves, according to the size of the vessels), but I\r\nnever heard them speak of any connection, or indeed any transactions,\r\nwith street-folk.\r\n\r\nAmong the things purchased in great quantities by the street-buyers\r\nof old metal are keys. The keys so bought are of every size, are\r\ngenerally very rusty, and present every form of manufacture, from\r\nthe simplest to the most complex wards. On my inquiring how such a\r\nnumber of keys without locks came to be offered for street-sale, I\r\nwas informed that there were often duplicate or triplicate keys to\r\none lock, and that in sales of household furniture, for instance,\r\nthere were often numbers of odd keys found about the premises and sold\r\n“in a lump;” that locks were often spoiled and unsaleable, wearing\r\nout long before the keys. Twopence a dozen is an usual price for a\r\ndozen “mixed keys,” to a street-buyer. Bolts are also freely bought\r\nby the street-people, as are holdfasts, bed-keys, and screws, “and\r\neverything,” I was told, “which some one or other among the poor is\r\nalways a-wanting.”\r\n\r\nA little old man, who had been many years a street-buyer, gave me an\r\naccount of his purchases of _bottles_ and _glass_. This man had been a\r\nsoldier in his youth; had known, as he said, “many ups and downs;” and\r\noccasionally wheels a barrow, somewhat larger and shallower than those\r\nused by masons, from which he vends iron and tin wares, such as cheap\r\ngridirons, stands for hand-irons, dust-pans, dripping trays, &c. As\r\nhe sold these wares, he offered to buy, or swop for, any second-hand\r\ncommodities. “As to the bottle and glass buying, sir,” he said, “it’s\r\ndead and buried in the streets, and in the country too. I’ve known\r\nthe day when I’ve cleared 2_l._ in a week by buying old things in a\r\ncountry round. How long was that ago, do you say, sir? Why perhaps\r\ntwenty years; yes, more than twenty. Now, I’d hardly pick up odd glass\r\nin the street.” [He called imperfect glass wares “odd glass.”] “O, I\r\ndon’t know what’s brought about such a change, but everything changes.\r\nI can’t say anything about the duty on glass. No, I never paid any\r\nduty on my glass; it ain’t likely. I buy glass still, certainly I do,\r\nbut I think if I depended on it I should be wishing myself in the East\r\nInjes again, rather than such a poor consarn of a business--d----n me\r\nif I shouldn’t. The last glass bargain I made about two months back,\r\ndown Limehouse-way, and about the Commercial-road, I cleared 7_d._ by;\r\nand then I had to wheel what I bought--it was chiefly bottles--about\r\nfive mile. It’s a trade would starve a cat, the buying of old glass. I\r\nnever bought glass by weight, but I’ve heard of some giving a halfpenny\r\nand a penny a pound. I always bought by the piece: from a halfpenny\r\nto a shilling (but that’s long since) for a bottle; and farthings and\r\nhalfpennies, and higher and sometimes lower, for wine and other glasses\r\nas was chipped or cracked, or damaged, for they could be sold in them\r\ndays. People’s got proud now, I fancy that’s one thing, and must have\r\neverything slap. O, I do middling: I live by one thing or other, and\r\nwhen I die there’ll just be enough to bury the old man.” [This is\r\nthe first street-trader I have met with who made such a statement as\r\nto having provided for his interment, though I have heard these men\r\noccasionally express repugnance at the thoughts of being buried by\r\nthe parish.] “I have a daughter, that’s all my family now; she does\r\nwell as a laundress, and is a real good sort; I have my dinner with\r\nher every Sunday. She’s a widow without any young ones. I often go to\r\nchurch, both with my daughter and by myself, on Sunday evenings. It\r\ndoes one good. I’m fond of the music and singing too. The sermon I\r\ncan very seldom make anything of, as I can’t hear well if any one’s a\r\ngood way off me when he’s saying anythink. I buy a little old metal\r\nsometimes, but it’s coming to be all up with street glass-people;\r\neverybody seems to run with their things to the rag-and-bottle-shops.”\r\n\r\nThe same body of traders buy also _old sacking, carpeting, and\r\nmoreen bed-curtains and window-hangings_; but the trade in them is\r\nsufficiently described in my account of the buying of rags, for it is\r\ncarried on in the same way, so much per pound (1_d._ or 1-1/2_d._ or\r\n2_d._), or so much for the lot.\r\n\r\nOf _Bones_ I have already spoken. They are bought by any\r\nstreet-collector with a cart, on his round in town, at a halfpenny\r\na pound, or three pounds for a penny; but it is a trade, on account\r\nof the awkwardness of carriage, little cared for by the regular\r\nstreet-buyers. Men, connected with some bone-grinding-mill, go round\r\nwith a horse and cart to the knackers and butchers to collect bones;\r\nbut this is a portion, not of street, but of the mill-owner’s,\r\nbusiness. These bones are ground for manure, which is extensively used\r\nby the agriculturists, having been first introduced in Yorkshire and\r\nLincolnshire about 30 years ago. The importation of bones is now very\r\ngreat; more than three times as much as it was 20 years back. The value\r\nof the foreign bones imported is estimated at upwards of 300,000_l._\r\nyearly. They are brought from South America (along with hides), from\r\nGermany, Holland, and Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe men who most care to collect bones in the streets of London are\r\nold and infirm, and they barter toys for them with poor children; for\r\nthose children sometimes gather bones in the streets and put them on\r\none side, or get them from dustholes, for the sake of exchanging them\r\nfor a plaything; or, indeed, for selling them to any shopkeeper, and\r\nmany of the rag-and-bottle-tradesmen buy bones. The toys most used for\r\nthis barter are paper “wind-mills.” These toy-barterers, when they have\r\na few pence, will buy bones of children or any others, if they cannot\r\nbecome possessed of them otherwise; but the carriage of the bones is a\r\ngreat obstacle to much being done in this business.\r\n\r\nIn the regular way of street-buying, such as I have described it, there\r\nare about 100 men in London and the suburbs. Some buy only during a\r\nportion of the year, and none perhaps (except in the way of barter) the\r\nyear round. They are chiefly of the costermonger class, some of the\r\nstreet-buyers however, have been carmen’s servants, or connected with\r\ntrades in which they had the care of a horse and cart, and so became\r\nhabituated to a street-life.\r\n\r\nThere are still many other ways in which the commerce in refuse and the\r\nsecond-hand street-trade is supplied. As the windmill-seller for bones,\r\nso will the puppet-show man for old bottles or broken table-spoons,\r\nor almost any old trifle, allow children to regale their eyes on the\r\nbeauties of his exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe trade expenditure of the street-buyers it is not easy to estimate.\r\nTheir calling is so mixed with selling and bartering, that very\r\nprobably not one among them can tell what he expends in _buying_,\r\nas a separate branch of his business. If 100 men expend 15_s._ each\r\nweekly, in the purchase of rags, old metal, &c., and if this trade be\r\nprosecuted for 30 weeks of the year, we find 2250_l._ so expended. The\r\nprofits of the buyers range from 20 to 100 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “RAG-AND-BOTTLE,” AND THE “MARINE-STORE,” SHOPS.\r\n\r\nThe principal purchasers of any refuse or worn-out articles are the\r\nproprietors of the rag-and-bottle-shops. Some of these men make a\r\ngood deal of money, and not unfrequently unite with the business the\r\nletting out of vans for the conveyance of furniture, or for pleasure\r\nexcursions, to such places as Hampton Court. The stench in these\r\nshops is positively sickening. Here in a small apartment may be a\r\npile of rags, a sack-full of bones, the many varieties of grease and\r\n“kitchen-stuff,” corrupting an atmosphere which, even without such\r\naccompaniments, would be too close. The windows are often crowded\r\nwith bottles, which exclude the light; while the floor and shelves\r\nare thick with grease and dirt. The inmates seem unconscious of this\r\nfoulness,--and one comparatively wealthy man, who showed me his horses,\r\nthe stable being like a drawing-room compared to his shop, in speaking\r\nof the many deaths among his children, could not conjecture to what\r\ncause it could be owing. This indifference to dirt and stench is the\r\nmore remarkable, as many of the shopkeepers have been gentlemen’s\r\nservants, and were therefore once accustomed to cleanliness and order.\r\nThe door-posts and windows of the rag-and-bottle-shops are often\r\nclosely placarded, and the front of the house is sometimes one glaring\r\ncolour, blue or red; so that the place may be at once recognised, even\r\nby the illiterate, as the “red house,” or the “blue house.” If these\r\nmen are not exactly street-buyers, they are street-billers, continually\r\ndistributing hand-bills, but more especially before Christmas. The\r\nmore aristocratic, however, now send round cards, and to the following\r\npurport:--\r\n\r\n  No. --                  No. --\r\n\r\n  THE ---- HOUSE IS ----’S\r\n  RAG, BOTTLE, AND KITCHEN STUFF\r\n  WAREHOUSE,\r\n  ---- STREET, ---- TOWN,\r\n  Where you can obtain Gold and Silver to any amount.\r\n\r\n  ESTABLISHED ----.\r\n\r\n  THE HIGHEST PRICE GIVEN\r\n  For all the undermentioned articles, viz:--\r\n\r\n  Wax and Sperm Pieces\r\n  Kitchen Stuff, &c.\r\n  Wine & Beer Bottles\r\n  Eau de Cologne, Soda Water\r\n  Doctors’ Bottles, &c.\r\n  White Linen Rags\r\n  Bones, Phials, & Broken Flint Glass\r\n  Old Copper, Brass, Pewter, &c.\r\n  Lead, Iron, Zinc, Steel, &c., &c.\r\n  Old Horse Hair, Mattresses, &c.\r\n  Old Books, Waste Paper, &c.\r\n  All kinds of Coloured Rags\r\n\r\n  The utmost value given for all kinds of Wearing\r\n  Apparel.\r\n\r\n  Furniture and Lumber of every description bought, and\r\n  full value given at his Miscellaneous Warehouse.\r\n\r\n  Articles sent for.\r\n\r\nSome content themselves with sending hand-bills to the houses in their\r\nneighbourhood, which many of the cheap printers keep in type, so that\r\nan alteration in the name and address is all which is necessary for any\r\ncustomer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI heard that suspicions were entertained that it was to some of these\r\ntraders that the facilities with which servants could dispose of their\r\npilferings might be attributed, and that a stray silver spoon might\r\nenhance the weight and price of kitchen-stuff. It is not pertaining to\r\nmy present subject to enter into the consideration of such a matter;\r\nand I might not have alluded to it, had not I found the regular\r\nstreet-buyers fond of expressing an opinion of the indifferent honesty\r\nof this body of traders; but my readers may have remarked how readily\r\nthe street-people have, on several occasions, justified (as they seem\r\nto think) their own delinquencies by quoting what they declared were as\r\ngreat and as frequent delinquencies on the part of shopkeepers: “I know\r\nvery well,” said an intelligent street-seller on one occasion, “that\r\ntwo wrongs can never make a right; but tricks that shopkeepers practise\r\nto grow rich upon we must practise, just as they do, to live at all.\r\nAs long as they give short weight and short measure, the streets can’t\r\nhelp doing the same.”\r\n\r\nThe _rag-and-bottle_ and the _marine-store shops_ are in many\r\ninstances but different names for the same description of business.\r\nThe chief distinction appears to be this: the marine-store shopkeepers\r\n(proper) do not meddle with what is a very principal object of\r\ntraffic with the rag-and-bottle man, the purchase of dripping, as\r\nwell as of every kind of refuse in the way of fat or grease. The\r\nmarine-store man, too, is more miscellaneous in his wares than his\r\ncontemporary of the rag-and-bottle-store, as the former will purchase\r\nany of the smaller articles of household furniture, old tea-caddies,\r\nknife-boxes, fire-irons, books, pictures, draughts and backgammon\r\nboards, bird-cages, Dutch clocks, cups and saucers, tools and brushes.\r\nThe-rag-and-bottle tradesman will readily purchase any of these\r\nthings to be disposed of as old metal or waste-paper, but his brother\r\ntradesman buys them to be re-sold and re-used for the purposes for\r\nwhich they were originally manufactured. When furniture, however, is\r\nthe staple of one of these second-hand storehouses, the proprietor\r\nis a furniture-broker, and not a marine-store dealer. If, again, the\r\ndealer in these stores confine his business to the purchase of old\r\nmetals, for instance, he is classed as an old metal dealer, collecting\r\nit or buying it of collectors, for sale to iron-founders, coppersmiths,\r\nbrass-founders, and plumbers. In perhaps the majority of instances\r\nthere is little or no distinction between the establishments I have\r\nspoken of. The _dolly_ business is common to both, but most common to\r\nthe marine-store dealer, and of it I shall speak afterwards.\r\n\r\nThese shops are exceedingly numerous. Perhaps in the poorer and\r\nsmaller streets they are more numerous even than the chandlers’ or the\r\nbeer-sellers’ places. At the corner of a small street, both in town\r\nand the nearer suburbs, will frequently be found the chandler’s shop,\r\nfor the sale of small quantities of cheese, bacon, groceries, &c., to\r\nthe poor. Lower down may be seen the beer-seller’s; and in the same\r\nstreet there is certain to be one rag-and-bottle or marine-store shop,\r\nvery often two, and not unfrequently another in some adjacent court.\r\n\r\nI was referred to the owner of a marine-store shop, as to a respectable\r\nman, keeping a store of the best class. Here the counter, or table, or\r\nwhatever it is to be called, for it was somewhat nondescript, by an\r\ningenious contrivance could be pushed out into the street, so that in\r\nbad weather the goods which were at other times exposed in the street\r\ncould be drawn inside without trouble. The glass frames of the window\r\nwere removable, and were placed on one side in the shop, for in the\r\nsummer an open casement seemed to be preferred. This is one of the\r\nremaining old trade customs still seen in London; for previously to the\r\ngreat fire in 1666, and the subsequent rebuilding of the city, shops\r\nwith open casements, and protected from the weather by overhanging\r\neaves, or by a sloping wooden roof, were general.\r\n\r\nThe house I visited was an old one, and abounded in closets and\r\nrecesses. The fire-place, which apparently had been large, was removed,\r\nand the space was occupied with a mass of old iron of every kind; all\r\nthis was destined for the furnace of the iron-founder, wrought iron\r\nbeing preferred for several of the requirements of that trade. A chest\r\nor range of very old drawers, with defaced or worn-out labels--once\r\na grocer’s or a chemist’s--was stuffed, in every drawer, with old\r\nhorse-shoe nails (valuable for steel manufacturers), and horse and\r\ndonkey shoes; brass knobs; glass stoppers; small bottles (among them a\r\nnumber of the cheap cast “hartshorn bottles”); broken pieces of brass\r\nand copper; small tools (such as shoemakers’ and harness-makers’ awls),\r\npunches, gimlets, plane-irons, hammer heads, &c.; odd dominoes, dice,\r\nand backgammon-men; lock escutcheons, keys, and the smaller sort of\r\nlocks, especially padlocks; in fine, any small thing which could be\r\nstowed away in such a place.\r\n\r\nIn one corner of the shop had been thrown, the evening before, a mass\r\nof old iron, then just bought. It consisted of a number of screws of\r\ndifferent lengths and substance; of broken bars and rails; of the\r\nodds and ends of the cogged wheels of machinery, broken up or worn\r\nout; of odd-looking spikes, and rings, and links; all heaped together\r\nand scarcely distinguishable. These things had all to be assorted;\r\nsome to be sold for re-use in their then form; the others to be sold\r\nthat they might be melted and cast into other forms. The floor was\r\nintricate with hampers of bottles; heaps of old boots and shoes; old\r\ndesks and work-boxes; pictures (all modern) with and without frames;\r\nwaste-paper, the most of it of quarto, and some larger sized, soiled\r\nor torn, and strung closely together in weights of from 2 to 7 lbs.;\r\nand a fire-proof safe, stuffed with old fringes, tassels, and other\r\nupholstery goods, worn and discoloured. The miscellaneous wares were\r\ncarried out into the street, and ranged by the door-posts as well as in\r\nfront of the house. In some small out-houses in the yard were piles of\r\nold iron and tin pans, and of the broken or separate parts of harness.\r\n\r\nFrom the proprietor of this establishment I had the following account:--\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in the business more than a dozen years. Before that, I\r\nwas an auctioneer’s, and then a furniture broker’s, porter. I wasn’t\r\nbrought up to any regular trade, but just to jobbing about, and a bad\r\ntrade it is, as all trades is that ain’t regular employ for a man. I\r\nhad some money when my father died--he kept a chandler’s shop--and I\r\nbought a marine.” [An elliptical form of speech among these traders.]\r\n“I gave 10_l._ for the stock, and 5_l._ for entrance and good-will,\r\nand agreed to pay what rents and rates was due. It was a smallish\r\nstock then, for the business had been neglected, but I have no reason\r\nto be sorry for my bargain, though it might have been better. There’s\r\nlots taken in about good-wills, but perhaps not so many in my way of\r\nbusiness, because we’re rather ‘fly to a dodge.’ It’s a confined sort\r\nof life, but there’s no help for that. Why, as to my way of trade,\r\nyou’d be surprised, what different sorts of people come to my shop.\r\nI don’t mean the regular hands; but the chance comers. I’ve had men\r\ndressed like gentlemen--and no doubt they was respectable when they was\r\nsober--bring two or three books, or a nice cigar case, or anythink that\r\ndon’t show in their pockets, and say, when as drunk as blazes, ‘Give me\r\nwhat you can for this; I want it sold for a particular purpose.’ That\r\nparticular purpose was more drink, I should say; and I’ve known the\r\nsame men come back in less than a week, and buy what they’d sold me at\r\na little extra, and be glad if I had it by me still. O, we sees a deal\r\nof things in this way of life. Yes, poor people run to such as me. I’ve\r\nknown them come with such things as teapots, and old hair mattresses,\r\nand flock beds, and _then_ I’m sure they’re hard up--reduced for a\r\nmeal. I don’t like buying big things like mattresses, though I do\r\npurchase ’em sometimes. Some of these sellers are as keen as Jews at\r\na bargain; others seem only anxious to get rid of the things and have\r\nhold of some bit of money anyhow. Yes, sir, I’ve known their hands\r\ntremble to receive the money, and mostly the women’s. They haven’t been\r\nused to it, I know, when that’s the case. Perhaps they comes to sell to\r\nme what the pawns won’t take in, and what they wouldn’t like to be seen\r\nselling to any of the men that goes about buying things in the street.\r\n\r\n“Why, I’ve bought everythink; at sales by auction there’s often ‘lots’\r\nmade up of different things, and they goes for very little. I buy of\r\npeople, too, that come to me, and of the regular hands that supply such\r\nshops as mine. I sell retail, and I sell to hawkers. I sell to anybody,\r\nfor gentlemen’ll come into my shop to buy anythink that’s took their\r\nfancy in passing. Yes, I’ve bought old oil paintings. I’ve heard of\r\nsome being bought by people in my way as have turned out stunners, and\r\nwas sold for a hundred pounds or more, and cost, perhaps, half-a-crown\r\nor only a shilling. I never experienced such a thing myself. There’s\r\na good deal of gammon about it. Well, it’s hardly possible to say\r\nanything about a scale of prices. I give 2_d._ for an old tin or metal\r\nteapot, or an old saucepan, and sometimes, two days after I’ve bought\r\nsuch a thing, I’ve sold it for 3_d._ to the man or woman I’ve bought\r\nit of. I’ll sell cheaper to them than to anybody else, because they\r\ncome to me in two ways--both as sellers and buyers. For pictures I’ve\r\ngiven from 3_d._ to 1_s._ I fancy they’re among the last things some\r\nsorts of poor people, which is a bit fanciful, parts with. I’ve bought\r\nthem of hawkers, but often I refuse them, as they’ve given more than I\r\ncould get. Pictures requires a judge. Some brought to me was published\r\nby newspapers and them sort of people. Waste-paper I buy as it comes.\r\nI can’t read very much, and don’t understand about books. I take the\r\nbacks off and weighs them, and gives 1_d._, and 1-1/2_d._, and 2_d._ a\r\npound, and there’s an end. I sell them at about 1/4_d._ a pound profit,\r\nor sometimes less, to men as we calls ‘waste’ men. It’s a poor part of\r\nour business, but the books and paper takes up little room, and then\r\nit’s clean and can be stowed anywhere, and is a sure sale. Well, the\r\npeople as sells ‘waste’ to me is not such as can read, I think; I don’t\r\nknow what they is; perhaps they’re such as obtains possession of the\r\nbooks and what-not after the death of old folks, and gets them out of\r\nthe way as quick as they can. I know nothink about what they are. Last\r\nweek, a man in black--he didn’t seem rich--came into my shop and looked\r\nat some old books, and said ‘Have you any black lead?’ He didn’t speak\r\nplain, and I could hardly catch him. I said, ‘No, sir, I don’t sell\r\nblack lead, but you’ll get it at No. 27,’ but he answered, ‘Not black\r\nlead, but black letter,’ speaking very pointed. I said, ‘No,’ and I\r\nhaven’t a notion what he meant.\r\n\r\n“Metal (copper) that I give 5_d._ or 5-1/2_d._ for, I can sell to the\r\nmerchants from 6-1/2_d._ to 8_d._ the pound. It’s no great trade, for\r\nthey’ll often throw things out of the lot and say they’re not metal.\r\nSometimes, it would hardly be a farthing in a shilling, if it war’n’t\r\nfor the draught in the scales. When we buys metal, we don’t notice the\r\nquarters of the pounds; all under a quarter goes for nothink. When we\r\nbuys iron, all under half pounds counts nothink. So when we buys by the\r\npound, and sells by the hundredweight, there’s a little help from this,\r\nwhich we calls the draught.\r\n\r\n“Glass bottles of all qualities I buys at three for a halfpenny, and\r\nsometimes four, up to 2_d._ a-piece for ‘good stouts’ (bottled-porter\r\nvessels), but very seldom indeed 2_d._, unless it’s something very\r\nprime and big like the old quarts (quart bottles). I seldom meddles\r\nwith decanters. It’s very few decanters as is offered to me, either\r\nlittle or big, and I’m shy of them when they are. There’s such a change\r\nin glass. Them as buys in the streets brings me next to nothing now\r\nto buy; they both brought and bought a lot ten year back and later. I\r\nnever was in the street-trade in second-hand, but it’s not what it was.\r\nI sell in the streets, when I put things outside, and know all about\r\nthe trade.\r\n\r\n“It ain’t a fortnight back since a smart female servant, in slap-up\r\nblack, sold me a basket-full of doctor’s bottles. I knew her master,\r\nand he hadn’t been buried a week before she come to me, and she said,\r\n‘missus is glad to get rid of them, for they makes her cry.’ They often\r\nsay their missusses sends things, and that they’re not on no account to\r\ntake less than so much. That’s true at times, and at times it ain’t.\r\nI gives from 1-1/2_d._ to 3_d._ a dozen for good new bottles. I’m\r\nsure I can’t say what I give for other odds and ends; just as they’re\r\ngood, bad, or indifferent. It’s a queer trade. Well, I pay my way, but\r\nI don’t know what I clear a week--about 2_l._ I dare say, but then\r\nthere’s rent, rates, and taxes to pay, and other expenses.”\r\n\r\nThe _Dolly_ system is peculiar to the rag-and-bottle man, as well as\r\nto the marine-store dealer. The name is derived from the black wooden\r\ndoll, in white apparel, which generally hangs dangling over the door\r\nof the marine-store shops, or of the “rag-and-bottles,” but more\r\nfrequently the last-mentioned. This type of the business is sometimes\r\nswung above their doors by those who are not dolly-shop keepers. The\r\ndolly-shops are essentially pawn-shops, and pawn-shops for the very\r\npoorest. There are many articles which the regular pawnbrokers decline\r\nto accept as pledges. Among these things are blankets, rugs, clocks,\r\nflock-beds, common pictures, “translated” boots, mended trowsers,\r\nkettles, saucepans, trays, &c. Such things are usually styled “lumber.”\r\nA poor person driven to the necessity of raising a few pence, and\r\nunwilling to part finally with his lumber, goes to the dolly-man, and\r\nfor the merest trifle advanced, deposits one or other of the articles\r\nI have mentioned, or something similar. For an advance of 2_d._ or\r\n3_d._, a halfpenny a week is charged, but the charge is the same if the\r\npledge be redeemed next day. If the interest be paid at the week’s end,\r\nanother 1_d._ is occasionally advanced, and no extra charge exacted\r\nfor interest. If the interest be not paid at the week or fortnight’s\r\nend, the article is forfeited, and is sold at a large profit by the\r\ndolly-shop man. For 4_d._ or 6_d._ advanced, the weekly interest is\r\n1_d._; for 9_d._ it is 1-1/2_d._; for 1_s._ it is 2_d._, and 2_d._ on\r\neach 1_s._ up to 5_s._, beyond which sum the “dolly” will rarely go; in\r\nfact, he will rarely advance as much. Two poor Irish flower girls, whom\r\nI saw in the course of my inquiry into that part of street-traffic, had\r\nin the winter very often to pledge the rug under which they slept at\r\na dolly-shop in the morning for 6_d._, in order to provide themselves\r\nwith stock-money to buy forced violets, and had to redeem it on their\r\nreturn in the evening, when they could, for 7_d._ Thus 6_d._ a week\r\nwas sometimes paid for a daily advance of that sum. Some of these\r\n“_illicit_” pawnbrokers even give tickets.\r\n\r\nThis incidental mention of what is really an immense trade, as regards\r\nthe number of pledges, is all that is necessary under the present head\r\nof inquiry, but I purpose entering into this branch of the subject\r\nfully and minutely when I come to treat of the class of “distributors.”\r\n\r\nThe _iniquities_ to which the poor are subject are positively\r\nmonstrous. A halfpenny a day interest on a loan of 2_d._ is at the rate\r\nof 7280 _per cent. per annum!_\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE BUYERS OF KITCHEN-STUFF, GREASE, AND DRIPPING.\r\n\r\nTHIS body of traders cannot be classed as street-buyers, so that only a\r\nbrief account is here necessary. The buyers are not now chance people,\r\nitinerant on any round, as at one period they were to a great extent,\r\nbut they are the proprietors of the rag and bottle and marine-store\r\nshops, or those they employ.\r\n\r\nIn this business there has been a considerable change. Until of late\r\nyears women, often wearing suspiciously large cloaks and carrying\r\nbaskets, ventured into perhaps every area in London, and asked for\r\nthe cook at every house where they thought a cook might be kept, and\r\nthis often at early morning. If the well-cloaked woman was known,\r\nbusiness could be transacted without delay: if she were a stranger, she\r\nrecommended herself by offering very liberal terms for “kitchen-stuff.”\r\nThe cook’s, or kitchen-maid’s, or servant-of-all-work’s “perquisites,”\r\nwere then generally disposed of to these collectors, some of whom\r\nwere charwomen in the houses they resorted to for the purchase of the\r\nkitchen-stuff. They were often satisfied to purchase the dripping, &c.,\r\nby the lump, estimating the weight and the value by the eye. In this\r\ntraffic was frequently mixed up a good deal of pilfering, directly or\r\nindirectly. Silver spoons were thus disposed of. Candles, purposely\r\nbroken and crushed, were often part of the grease; in the dripping,\r\nbutter occasionally added to the weight; in the “stock” (the remains\r\nof meat boiled down for the making of soup) were sometimes portions of\r\nexcellent meat fresh from the joints which had been carved at table;\r\nand among the broken bread, might be frequently seen small loaves,\r\nunbroken.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that this mode of traffic by itinerant charwomen,\r\n&c., is still carried on, but to a much smaller extent than formerly.\r\nThe cook’s perquisites are in many cases sold under the inspection of\r\nthe mistress, according to agreement; or taken to the shop by the cook\r\nor some fellow-servant; or else sent for by the shopkeeper. This is\r\ndone to check the confidential, direct, and immediate trade-intercourse\r\nbetween merely two individuals, the buyer and seller, by making the\r\ntransaction more open and regular. I did not hear of any persons who\r\nmerely purchase the kitchen-stuff, as street-buyers, and sell it at\r\nonce to the tallow-melter or the soap-boiler; it appears all to find\r\nits way to the shops I have described, even when bought by charwomen;\r\nwhile the shopkeepers send for it or receive it in the way I have\r\nstated, so that there is but little of street traffic in the matter.\r\n\r\nOne of these shopkeepers told me that in this trading, as far as his\r\nown opinion went, there was as much trickery as ever, and that many\r\ngentlefolk quietly made up their minds to submit to it, while others,\r\nhe said, “kept the house in hot water” by resisting it. I found,\r\nhowever, the general opinion to be, that when servants could only\r\ndispose of these things to known people, the responsibility of the\r\nbuyer as well as the seller was increased, and acted as a preventive\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nThe price for kitchen-stuff is 1_d._ and 1-1/2_d._ the pound; for\r\ndripping--used by the poor as a substitute for butter--3-1/2_d._ to\r\n5_d._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-BUYERS OF HARE AND RABBIT SKINS.\r\n\r\nThese buyers are for the most part poor, old, or infirm people, and\r\nI am informed that the majority have been in some street business,\r\nand often as buyers, all their lives. Besides having derived this\r\ninformation from well-informed persons, I may point out that this\r\nis but a reasonable view of the case. If a mechanic, a labourer,\r\nor a gentleman’s servant, resorts to the streets for his bread, or\r\nbecause he is of a vagrant “turn,” he does not become a _buyer_, but\r\na _seller_. Street-selling is the easier process. It is easy for a\r\nman to ascertain that oysters, for example, are sold wholesale at\r\nBillingsgate, and if he buy a bushel (as in the present summer) for\r\n5_s._, it is not difficult to find out how many he can afford for “a\r\npenny a lot.” But the street-buyer must not only know what to _give_,\r\nfor hare-skins for instance, but what he can depend upon _getting_\r\nfrom the hat-manufacturers, or hat-furriers, and upon having a regular\r\nmarket. Thus a double street-trade knowledge is necessary, and a novice\r\nwill not care to meddle with any form of open-air traffic but the\r\nsimplest. Neither is street-buying (old clothes excepted) generally\r\ncared for by adults who have health and strength.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a former inquiry I received an account of\r\nhareskin-buying from a woman, upwards of fifty, who had been in the\r\ntrade, she told me, from childhood, “as was her mother before her.”\r\nThe husband, who was lame, and older than his wife, had been all _his_\r\nlife a field-catcher of birds, and a street-seller of hearth-stones.\r\nThey had been married 31 years, and resided in a garret of a house, in\r\na street off Drury-lane--a small room, with a close smell about it.\r\nThe room was not unfurnished--it was, in fact, crowded. There were\r\nbird-cages, with and without birds, over what _was_ once a bed; for\r\nthe bed, just prior to my visit, had been sold to pay the rent, and a\r\nmonth’s rent was again in arrear; and there were bird-cages on the wall\r\nby the door, and bird-cages over the mantelshelf. There was furniture,\r\ntoo, and crockery; and a vile oil painting of “still life;” but an eye\r\nused to the furniture in the rooms of the poor could at once perceive\r\nthat there was not _one_ article which could be sold to a broker or\r\nmarine-store dealer, or pledged at a pawn-shop. I was told the man and\r\nwoman both drank hard. The woman said:--\r\n\r\n“I’ve sold hareskins all my life, sir, and was born in London; but when\r\nhareskins isn’t in, I sells flowers. I goes about now (in November)\r\nfor my skins every day, wet or dry, and all day long--that is, till\r\nit’s dark. To-day I’ve not laid out a penny, but then it’s been such a\r\nday for rain. I reckon that if I gets hold of eighteen hare and rabbit\r\nskins in a day, that is my greatest day’s work. I gives 2_d._ for\r\ngood hares, what’s not riddled much, and sells them all for 2-1/2_d._\r\nI sells what I pick up, by the twelve or the twenty, if I can afford\r\nto keep them by me till that number’s gathered, to a Jew. I don’t\r\nknow what is done with them. I can’t tell you just what use they’re\r\nfor--something about hats.” [The Jew was no doubt a hat-furrier, or\r\nsupplying a hat-furrier.] “Jews gives us better prices than Christians,\r\nand buys readier; so I find. Last week I sold all I bought for 3_s._\r\n6_d._ I take some weeks as much as 8_s._ for what I pick up, and if\r\nI could get that every week I should think myself a lady. The profit\r\nleft me a clear half-crown. There’s no difference in any perticler\r\nyear--only that things gets worse. The game laws, as far as I knows,\r\nhasn’t made no difference in my trade. Indeed, I can’t say I knows\r\nanything about game laws at all, or hears anything consarning ’em. I\r\ngoes along the squares and streets. I buys most at gentlemen’s houses.\r\nWe never calls at hotels. The servants, and the women that chars,\r\nand washes, and jobs, manages it there. Hareskins is in--leastways I\r\nc’lects them--from September to the end of March, when hares, they\r\nsays, goes mad. I can’t say what I makes one week with another--perhaps\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ may be cleared every week.”\r\n\r\nThese buyers go regular rounds, carrying the skins in their hands, and\r\ncrying, “Any hareskins, cook? Hareskins.” It is for the most part a\r\nwinter trade; but some collect the skins all the year round, as the\r\nhares are now vended the year through; but by far the most are gathered\r\nin the winter. Grouse may not be killed excepting from the 12th, and\r\nblack-game from the 20th of August to the 10th of December; partridges\r\nfrom the 1st of September to the 1st of February; while the pheasant\r\nsuffers a shorter season of slaughter, from the 1st of October to the\r\n1st of February; but there is no time restriction as to the killing of\r\nhares or of rabbits, though custom causes a cessation for a few months.\r\n\r\nA lame man, apparently between 50 and 60, with a knowing look, gave\r\nme the following account. When I saw him he was carrying a few tins,\r\nchiefly small dripping-pans, under his arm, which he offered for\r\nsale as he went his round collecting hare and rabbit skins, of which\r\nhe carried but one. He had been in the streets all his life, as his\r\nmother--he never knew any father--was a rag-gatherer, and at the same\r\ntime a street-seller of the old brimstone matches and papers of pins.\r\nMy informant assisted his mother to make and then to sell the matches.\r\nOn her last illness she was received into St. Giles’s workhouse, her\r\nson supporting himself out of it; she had been dead many years. He\r\ncould not read, and had never been in a church or chapel in his life.\r\n“He had been married,” he said, “for about a dozen years, and had a\r\nvery good wife,” who was also a street-trader until her death; but “we\r\ndidn’t go to church or anywhere to be married,” he told me, in reply\r\nto my question, “for we really couldn’t afford to pay the parson, and\r\nso we took one another’s words. If it’s so good to go to church for\r\nbeing married, it oughtn’t to cost a poor man nothing; he shouldn’t be\r\ncharged for being good. I doesn’t do any business in town, but has my\r\nregular rounds. This is my Kentish and Camden-town day. I buys most\r\nfrom the servants at the bettermost houses, and I’d rather buy of them\r\nthan the missusses, for some missusses sells their own skins, and they\r\noften want a deal for ’em. Why, just arter last Christmas, a young\r\nlady in that there house (pointing to it), after ordering me round to\r\nthe back-door, came to me with two hareskins. They certainly was fine\r\nskins--werry fine. I said I’d give 4-1/2_d._ ‘Come now, my good man,’\r\nsays she,” and the man mimicked her voice, “‘let me have no nonsense. I\r\ncan’t be deceived any longer, either by you or my servants; so give me\r\n8_d._, and go about your business.’ Well, I went about my business; and\r\na woman called to buy them, and offered 4_d._ for the two, and the lady\r\nwas so wild, the servant told me arter; howsomever she only got 4_d._\r\nat last. She’s a regular screw, but a fine-dressed one. I don’t know\r\nthat there’s been any change in my business since hares was sold in the\r\nshops. If there’s more skins to sell, there’s more poor people to buy.\r\nI never tasted hares’ flesh in my life, though I’ve gathered so many of\r\ntheir skins. I’ve smelt it when they’ve been roasting them where I’ve\r\ncalled, but don’t think I could eat any. I live on bread and butter and\r\ntea, or milk sometimes in hot weather, and get a bite of fried fish or\r\nanything when I’m out, and a drop of beer and a smoke when I get home,\r\nif I can afford it. I don’t smoke in my own place, I uses a beer-shop.\r\nI pay 1_s._ 6_d._ a week for a small room; I want little but a bed in\r\nit, and have my own. I owe three weeks’ rent now; but I do best both\r\nwith tins and hareskins in the cold weather. Monday’s my best day. O,\r\nas to rabbit-skins, I do werry little in them. Them as sells them gets\r\nthe skins. Still there _is_ a few to be picked up; such as them as has\r\nbeen sent as presents from the country. Good rabbit-skins is about\r\nthe same price as hares, or perhaps a halfpenny lower, take them all\r\nthrough. I generally clears 6_d._ a dozen on my hare and rabbit-skins,\r\nand sometimes 8_d._ Yes, I should say that for about eight months I\r\ngathers four dozen every week, often five dozen. I suppose I make 5_s._\r\nor 6_s._ a week all the year, with one thing or other, and a lame man\r\ncan’t do wonders. I never begged in my life, but I’ve twice had help\r\nfrom the parish, and that only when I was very bad (ill). O, I suppose\r\nI shall end in the great house.”\r\n\r\nThere are, as closely as I can ascertain, at least 50 persons buying\r\nskins in the street; and calculating that each collects 50 skins\r\nweekly for 32 weeks of the year, we find 80,000 to be the total. This\r\nis a reasonable computation, for there are upwards of 102,000 hares\r\nconsigned yearly to Newgate and Leadenhall markets; while the rabbits\r\nsold yearly in London amount to about 1,000,000; but, as I have shown,\r\nvery few of their skins are disposed of to street-buyers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-BUYERS OF WASTE (PAPER).\r\n\r\nBeyond all others the street-purchase of waste paper is the most\r\ncurious of any in the hands of the class I now treat of. Some may have\r\nformed the notion that waste paper is merely that which is soiled or\r\ntorn, or old numbers of newspapers, or other periodical publications;\r\nbut this is merely a portion of the trade, as the subsequent account\r\nwill show.\r\n\r\nThe men engaged in this business have not unfrequently an apartment,\r\nor a large closet, or recess, for the reception of their purchases of\r\npaper. They collect their paper street by street, calling upon every\r\npublisher, coffee-shop keeper, printer, or publican (but rarely on a\r\npublican), who may be a seller of “waste.” I heard the refuse paper\r\ncalled nothing but “waste” after the general elliptical fashion.\r\nAttorneys’ offices are often visited by these buyers, as are the\r\noffices of public men, such as tax or rate collectors, generally.\r\n\r\nOne man told me that until about ten years ago, and while he was a\r\nyouth, he was employed by a relation in the trade to carry out waste\r\npaper sold to, or ordered by cheesemongers, &c., but that he never\r\n“collected,” or bought paper himself. At last he thought he would start\r\non his own account, and the first person he called upon, he said, was a\r\nrich landlady, not far from Hungerford-market, whom he saw sometimes at\r\nher bar, and who was always very civil. He took an opportunity to ask\r\nher if she “happened to have any waste in the house, or would have any\r\nin a week or so?” Seeing the landlady look surprised and not very well\r\npleased at what certainly appeared an impertinent inquiry, he hastened\r\nto explain that he meant old newspapers, or anything that way, which he\r\nwould be glad to buy at so much a pound. The landlady however took in\r\nbut one daily and one weekly paper (both sent into the country when a\r\nday or so old), and having had no dealings with men of my informant’s\r\navocation, could not understand his object in putting such questions.\r\n\r\nEvery kind of paper is purchased by the “waste-men.” One of these\r\ndealers said to me: “I’ve often in my time ‘cleared out’ a lawyer’s\r\noffice. I’ve bought old briefs, and other law papers, and ‘forms’ that\r\nweren’t the regular forms then, and any d----d thing they had in my\r\nline. You’ll excuse me, sir, but I couldn’t help thinking what a lot\r\nof misery was caused, perhaps, by the cwts. of waste I’ve bought at\r\nsuch places. If my father hadn’t got mixed up with law he wouldn’t have\r\nbeen ruined, and his children wouldn’t have had such a hard fight of\r\nit; so I hate law. All that happened when I was a child, and I never\r\nunderstood the rights or the wrongs of it, and don’t like to think of\r\npeople that’s so foolish. I gave 1-1/2_d._ a pound for all I bought at\r\nthe lawyers, and done pretty well with it, but very likely that’s the\r\nonly good turn such paper ever did any one--unless it were the lawyers\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nThe waste-dealers do not confine their purchases to the tradesmen I\r\nhave mentioned. They buy of any one, and sometimes act as middlemen or\r\nbrokers. For instance, many small stationers and newsvendors, sometimes\r\ntobacconists in no extensive way of trade, sometimes chandlers,\r\nannounce by a bill in their windows, “Waste Paper Bought and Sold in\r\nany Quantity,” while more frequently perhaps the trade is carried\r\non, as an understood part of these small shopmen’s business, without\r\nany announcement. Thus the shop-buyers have much miscellaneous waste\r\nbrought to them, and perhaps for only some particular kind have they a\r\ndemand by their retail customers. The regular itinerant waste dealer\r\nthen calls and “clears out everything” the “everything” being not an\r\nunmeaning word. One man, who “did largely in waste,” at my request\r\nendeavoured to enumerate all the kinds of paper he had purchased as\r\nwaste, and the packages of paper he showed me, ready for delivery\r\nto his customers on the following day, confirmed all he said as he\r\nopened them and showed me of what they were composed. He had dealt, he\r\nsaid--and he took great pains and great interest in the inquiry, as\r\none very curious, and was a respectable and intelligent man--in “books\r\non _every_ subject” [I give his own words] “on which a book can be\r\nwritten.” After a little consideration he added: “Well, perhaps _every_\r\nsubject is a wide range; but if there are any exceptions, it’s on\r\nsubjects not known to a busy man like me, who is occupied from morning\r\ntill night every week day. The only worldly labour I do on a Sunday\r\nis to take my family’s dinner to the bake-house, bring it home after\r\nchapel, and read _Lloyd’s Weekly_. I’ve had Bibles--the backs are taken\r\noff in the waste trade, or it wouldn’t be fair weight--Testaments,\r\nPrayer-books, Companions to the Altar, and Sermons and religious works.\r\nYes, I’ve had the Roman Catholic books, as is used in their public\r\nworship--at least so I suppose, for I never was in a Roman Catholic\r\nchapel. Well, it’s hard to say about proportions, but in my opinion,\r\nas far as it’s good for anything, I’ve not had _them_ in anything like\r\nthe proportion that I’ve had Prayer-books, and Watts’ and Wesley’s\r\nhymns. More shame; but you see, sir, perhaps a godly old man dies,\r\nand those that follow him care nothing for hymn-books, and so they\r\ncome to such as me, for they’re so cheap now they’re not to be sold\r\nsecond-hand at all, I fancy. I’ve dealt in tragedies and comedies, old\r\nand new, cut and uncut--they’re best uncut, for you can make them into\r\nsheets then--and farces, and books of the opera. I’ve had scientific\r\nand medical works of every possible kind, and histories, and travels,\r\nand lives, and memoirs. I needn’t go through them--everything, from\r\na needle to an anchor, as the saying is. Poetry, ay, many a hundred\r\nweight; Latin and Greek (sometimes), and French, and other foreign\r\nlanguages. Well now, sir, as you mention it, I think I never _did_ have\r\na Hebrew work; I think not, and I know the Hebrew letters when I see\r\nthem. Black letter, not once in a couple of years; no, nor in three or\r\nfour years, when I think of it. I have met with it, but I always take\r\nanything I’ve got that way to Mr. ----, the bookseller, who uses a\r\npoor man well. Don’t you think, sir, I’m complaining of poverty; though\r\nI have been very poor, when I was recovering from cholera at the first\r\nbreak-out of it, and I’m anything but rich now. Pamphlets I’ve had by\r\nthe ton, in my time; I think we should both be tired if I could go\r\nthrough all they were about. Very many were religious, more’s the pity.\r\nI’ve heard of a page round a quarter of cheese, though, touching a\r\nman’s heart.”\r\n\r\nIn corroboration of my informant’s statement, I may mention that in the\r\ncourse of my inquiry into the condition of the fancy cabinet-makers\r\nof the metropolis, one elderly and very intelligent man, a first-rate\r\nartisan in skill, told me he had been so reduced in the world by the\r\nunderselling of slop-masters (called “butchers” or “slaughterers,” by\r\nthe workmen in the trade), that though in his youth he could take in\r\nthe _News_ and _Examiner_ papers (each he believed 9_d._ at that time,\r\nbut was not certain), he could afford, and enjoyed, no reading when\r\nI saw him last autumn, beyond the book-leaves in which he received\r\nhis quarter of cheese, his small piece of bacon or fresh meat, or his\r\nsaveloys; and his wife schemed to go to the shops who “wrapped up their\r\nthings from books,” in order that he might have something to read after\r\nhis day’s work.\r\n\r\nMy informant went on with his specification: “Missionary papers of all\r\nkinds. Parliamentary papers, but not so often new ones, very largely.\r\nRailway prospectuses, with plans to some of them, nice engravings; and\r\nthe same with other joint-stock companies. Children’s copy-books, and\r\ncyphering-books. Old account-books of every kind. A good many years\r\nago, I had some that must have belonged to a West End perfumer, there\r\nwas such French items for Lady this, or the Honourable Captain that. I\r\nremember there was an Hon. Capt. G., and almost at every second page\r\nwas ‘100 tooth-picks, 3_s._ 6_d._’ I think it was 3_s._ 6_d._; in\r\narranging this sort of waste one now and then gives a glance to it.\r\nDictionaries of every sort, I’ve had, but not so commonly. Music books,\r\nlots of them. Manuscripts, but only if they’re rather old; well, 20 or\r\n30 years or so: I call that old. Letters on every possible subject,\r\nbut not, in my experience, any very modern ones. An old man dies, you\r\nsee, and his papers are sold off, letters and all; that’s the way; get\r\nrid of all the old rubbish, as soon as the old boy’s pointing his toes\r\nto the sky. What’s old letters worth, when the writers are dead and\r\nburied? why, perhaps 1-1/2_d._ a pound, and it’s a rattling big letter\r\nthat will weigh half-an-ounce. O, it’s a queer trade, but there’s many\r\nworse.”\r\n\r\nThe letters which I saw in another waste-dealer’s possession were 45\r\nin number, a small collection, I was told; for the most part they were\r\nvery dull and common-place. Among them, however, was the following,\r\nin an elegant, and I presume a female hand, but not in the modern\r\nfashionable style of handwriting. The letter is evidently old, the\r\naddress is of West-end gentility, but I leave out name and other\r\nparticularities:--\r\n\r\n “Mrs. ---- [it is not easy to judge whether the flourished letters\r\n are ‘Mrs.’ or ‘Miss,’ but certainly more like ‘Mrs.’] Mrs. ----\r\n (Zoological Artist) presents her compliments to Mr. ----, and being\r\n commissioned to communicate with a gentleman of the name, recently\r\n arrived at Charing-cross, and presumed by description to be himself,\r\n in a matter of delicacy and confidence, indispensably verbal; begs to\r\n say, that if interested in the ecclaircissement and necessary to the\r\n same, she may be found in attendance, any afternoon of the current\r\n week, from 3 to 6 o’clock, and no other hours.\r\n\r\n “---- street, ---- square.\r\n\r\n   “Monday Morn. for the aftn., at home.”\r\n\r\nAmong the books destined to a butcher, I found three perfect numbers\r\nof a sixpenny periodical, published a few years back. Three, or rather\r\ntwo and a half, numbers of a shilling periodical, with “coloured\r\nengravings of the fashions.” Two (imperfect) volumes of French Plays,\r\nan excellent edition; among the plays were Athalie, Iphigénie, Phèdre,\r\nLes Frères Ennemis, Alexandre, Andromaque, Les Plaideurs, and Esther.\r\nA music sheet, headed “A lonely thing I would not be.” A few pages of\r\nwhat seems to have been a book of tales: “Album d’un Sourd-Muet” (36\r\npages in the pamphlet form, quite new). All these constituted about\r\ntwopennyworth to the butcher. Notwithstanding the variety of sources\r\nfrom which the supply is derived, I heard from several quarters that\r\n“waste never was so scarce” as at present; it was hardly to be had at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe purchasers of the waste-paper from the collectors are\r\ncheesemongers, buttermen, butchers, fishmongers, poulterers, pork and\r\nsausage-sellers, sweet-stuff-sellers, tobacconists, chandlers--and\r\nindeed all who sell provisions or such luxuries as I have mentioned\r\nin retail. Some of the wholesale provision houses buy very largely\r\nand sell the waste again to their customers, who pay more for it by\r\nsuch a medium of purchase, but they have it thus on credit. Any retail\r\ntrader in provisions at all “in a large way,” will readily buy six or\r\nseven cwt. at a time. The price given by them varies from 1-1/4_d._ to\r\n3-1/2_d._ the pound, but it is very rarely either so low or so high.\r\nThe average price may be taken at 18_s._ the cwt., which is not quite\r\n2_d._ a pound, and at this rate I learn from the best-informed parties\r\nthere are twelve tons sold weekly, or 1624 tons yearly (1,397,760\r\nlbs.), at the cost of 11,232_l._ One man in the trade was confident the\r\nvalue of the waste paper sold could not be less than 12,000_l._ in a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThere are about 60 men in this trade, nearly 50 of whom live entirely,\r\nas it was described to me, “by their waste,” and bring up their\r\nfamilies upon it. The others unite some other avocation with it. The\r\nearnings of the regular collectors vary from 15_s._ weekly to 35_s._\r\naccordingly as they meet with a supply on favourable terms, or, as they\r\ncall it, “a good pull in a lot of waste.” They usually reside in a\r\nprivate room with a recess, or a second room, in which they sort, pack,\r\nand keep their paper.\r\n\r\nOne of these traders told me that he was satisfied that stolen\r\npaper seldom found its way, directly, into the collectors’ hands,\r\n“particularly publisher’s paper,” he added. “Why, not long since there\r\nwas a lot of sheets stolen from Alderman Kelly’s warehouse, and the\r\nthief didn’t take them to a waste dealer; he knew better. He took them,\r\nsir, to a tradesman in a large respectable way over the water--a man\r\nthat uses great lots of waste--and sold them at just what was handed to\r\nhim: I suppose no questions asked. The thief was tried and convicted,\r\nbut nothing was done to the buyer.”\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the waste-paper used by the London\r\ntradesmen costs no more than 12,000_l._ in a year. A large quantity is\r\nbought direct by butchers and others from poor persons going to them\r\nwith a small quantity of their own accumulating, or with such things as\r\ncopy-books.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-BUYERS OF UMBRELLAS AND PARASOLS.\r\n\r\nThe street-traders in old umbrellas and parasols are numerous, but the\r\nbuying is but one part, and the least skilled part, of the business.\r\nMen, some tolerably well-dressed, some swarthy-looking, like gipsies,\r\nand some with a vagabond aspect, may be seen in all quarters of the\r\ntown and suburbs, carrying a few ragged-looking umbrellas, or the\r\nsticks or ribs of umbrellas, under their arms, and crying “Umbrellas\r\nto mend,” or “Any old umbrellas to sell?” The traffickers in umbrellas\r\nare also the crockmen, who are always glad to obtain them in barter,\r\nand who merely dispose of them at the Old Clothes Exchange, or in\r\nPetticoat-lane.\r\n\r\nThe umbrella-menders are known by an appellation of an appropriateness\r\nnot uncommon in street language. They are _mushroom-fakers_. The form\r\nof the expanded umbrella resembles that of a mushroom, and it has\r\nthe further characteristic of being rapidly or suddenly raised, the\r\nmushroom itself springing up and attaining its full size in a very\r\nbrief space of time. The term, however, like all street or popular\r\nterms or phrases, has become very generally condensed among those who\r\ncarry on the trade--they are now _mush-fakers_, a word which, to any\r\none who has not heard the term in full, is as meaningless as any in the\r\nvocabulary of slang.\r\n\r\nThe mushroom-fakers will repair any umbrella on the owner’s premises,\r\nand their work is often done adroitly, I am informed, and as often\r\nbunglingly, or, in the trade term, “botched.” So far there is no\r\ntraffic in the business, the mushroom-faker simply performing a piece\r\nof handicraft, and being paid for the job. But there is another class\r\nof street-folk who buy the old umbrellas in Petticoat-lane, or of the\r\nstreet buyer or collector, and “sometimes,” as one of these men said to\r\nme, “we are our own buyers on a round.” They mend the umbrellas--some\r\nof their wives, I am assured, being adepts as well as themselves--and\r\noffer them for sale on the approaches to the bridges, and at the\r\ncorners of streets.\r\n\r\nThe street umbrella trade is really curious. Not so very many years\r\nback the use of an umbrella by a man was regarded as partaking of\r\neffeminacy, but now they are sold in thousands in the streets, and in\r\nthe second-hand shops of Monmouth-street and such places. One of these\r\nstreet-traders told me that he had lately sold, but not to an extent\r\nwhich might encourage him to proceed, old silk umbrellas in the street\r\nfor gentlemen to protect themselves from the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of umbrellas is in a great degree mixed up with that\r\nof old clothes, of which I have soon to treat; but from what I have\r\nstated it is evident that the umbrella trade is most connected with\r\nstreet-artisanship, and under that head I shall describe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-JEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough my present inquiry relates to London life in London streets,\r\nit is necessary that I should briefly treat of the Jews generally, as\r\nan integral, but distinct and peculiar part of street-life.\r\n\r\nThat this ancient people were engaged in what may be called\r\nstreet-traffic in the earlier ages of our history, as well as in the\r\nimportation of spices, furs, fine leather, armour, drugs, and general\r\nmerchandise, there can be no doubt; nevertheless concerning this part\r\nof the subject there are but the most meagre accounts.\r\n\r\nJews were settled in England as early as 730, and during the sway\r\nof the Saxon kings. They increased in number after the era of the\r\nConquest; but it was not until the rapacity to which they were exposed\r\nin the reign of Stephen had in a great measure exhausted itself, and\r\nuntil the measures of Henry II. had given encouragement to commerce,\r\nand some degree of security to property in cities or congregated\r\ncommunities, that the Jews in England became numerous and wealthy.\r\nThey then became active and enterprising attendants at fairs, where\r\nthe greater portion of the internal trade of the kingdom was carried\r\non, and especially the traffic in the more valuable commodities, such\r\nas plate, jewels, armour, cloths, wines, spices, horses, cattle, &c.\r\nThe agents of the great prelates and barons, and even of the ruling\r\nprinces, purchased what they required at these fairs. St. Giles’s fair,\r\nheld at St. Giles’s hill, not far from Winchester, continued sixteen\r\ndays. The fair was, as it were, a temporary city. There were streets of\r\ntents in every direction, in which the traders offered and displayed\r\ntheir wares. During the continuance of the fair, business was strictly\r\nprohibited in Winchester, Southampton, and in every place within seven\r\nmiles of St. Giles’s hill. Among the tent-owners at such fairs were the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\nAt this period the Jews may be considered as one of the bodies of\r\n“merchant-strangers,” as they were called, settled in England for\r\npurposes of commerce. Among the other bodies of these “strangers” were\r\nthe German “merchants of the steel-yard,” the Lombards, the Caursini\r\nof Rome, the “merchants of the staple,” and others. These were all\r\ncorporations, and thriving corporations (when unmolested), and the Jews\r\nhad also their Jewerie, or Judaisme, not for a “corporation” merely,\r\nbut also for the requirements of their faith and worship, and for their\r\nliving together. The London Jewerie was established in a place of which\r\nno vestige of its establishment now remains beyond the name--the Old\r\nJewry. Here was erected the first synagogue of the Jews in England,\r\nwhich was defaced or demolished, Maitland states, by the citizens,\r\nafter they had slain 700 Jews (other accounts represent that number as\r\ngreatly exaggerated). This took place in 1263, during one of the many\r\ndisturbances in the uneasy reign of Henry III.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Jews amassed wealth by trade and usury, in spite\r\nof their being plundered and maltreated by the princes and other\r\npotentates--every one has heard of King John’s having a Jew’s teeth\r\ndrawn--and in spite of their being reviled by the priests and hated by\r\nthe people. The sovereigns generally encouraged “merchant-strangers.”\r\nWhen the city of London, in 1289, petitioned Edward I. for “the\r\nexpulsion of all merchant-strangers,” that monarch answered, with all\r\na monarch’s peculiar regard for “great” men and “great” men only,\r\n“No! the merchant-strangers are useful and beneficial to the great\r\nmen of the kingdom, and I will not expel them.” But though the King\r\nencouraged, the people detested, _all_ foreign traders, though not\r\nwith the same intensity as they detested and contemned the Jews, for\r\nin _that_ detestation a strong religious feeling was an element. Of\r\nthis dislike to the merchant-strangers, very many instances might be\r\ncited, but I need give only one. In 1379, nearly a century after the\r\nbanishment of the Jews, a Genoese merchant, a man of great wealth,\r\npetitioned Richard II. for permission to deposit goods for safe keeping\r\nin Southampton Castle, promising to introduce so large a share of\r\nthe commerce of the East into England, that pepper should be 4_d._\r\na pound. “Yet the Londoners,” writes Walsingham, but in the quaint\r\nmonkish Latin of the day, “enemies to the prosperity of their country,\r\nhired assassins, who murdered the merchant in the street. After this,\r\nwhat stranger will trust his person among a people so faithless and so\r\ncruel? who will not dread our treachery, and abhor our name?”\r\n\r\nIn 1290, by a decree of Edward I., the Jews were banished out of\r\nEngland. The causes assigned for this summary act, were “their\r\nextortions, their debasing and diminishing the coin, and for other\r\ncrimes.” I need not enter into the merits or demerits of the Jews of\r\nthat age, but it is certain that any ridiculous charge, any which it\r\nwas impossible could be true, was an excuse for the plundering of\r\nthem at the hands of the rich, and the persecution of them at the\r\nhands of the people. At the period of this banishment, their number\r\nis represented by the contemporaneous historians to have been about\r\n16,000, a number most probably exaggerated, as perhaps all statements\r\nof the numbers of a people are when no statistical knowledge has been\r\nacquired. During this period of their abode in England, the Jews\r\nwere protected as the villeins or bondsmen of the king, a protection\r\ndisregarded by the commonalty, and only giving to the executive\r\ngovernment greater facilities of extortion and oppression.\r\n\r\nIn 1655 an Amsterdam Jew, Rabbi Manasseh Ben-Israel, whose name is\r\nstill highly esteemed among his countrymen, addressed Cromwell on\r\nthe behalf of the Jews that they should be re-admitted into England\r\nwith the sanction, and under the protection, of the law. Despite the\r\nabsence of such sanction, they had resided and of course traded in\r\nthis country, but in small numbers, and trading often in indirect\r\nand sometimes in contraband ways. Chaucer, writing in the days of\r\nRichard II., three reigns after their expulsion, speaks of Jews as\r\nliving in England. It is reputed that, in the reigns of Elizabeth\r\nand the first James, they supplied, at great profit, the materials\r\nrequired by the alchymists for their experiments in the transmutation\r\nof metals. In Elizabeth’s reign, too, Jewish physicians were highly\r\nesteemed in England. The Queen at one time confided the care of her\r\nhealth to Rodrigo Lopez, a Hebrew, who, however, was convicted of an\r\nattempt to poison his royal mistress. Francis I., of France, carried\r\nhis opinion of Jewish medical skill to a great height; he refused on\r\none occasion, during an illness, to be attended by the most eminent of\r\nthe Israelitish physicians, because the learned man had just before\r\nbeen converted to Christianity. The most Christian king, therefore,\r\napplied to his ally, the Turkish sultan, Solyman II., who sent him “a\r\ntrue hardened Jew,” by whose directions Francis drank asses’ milk and\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nCromwell’s response to the application of Manasseh Ben Israel was\r\nfavourable; but the opposition of the Puritans, and more especially\r\nof Prynne, prevented any public declaration on the subject. In 1656,\r\nhowever, the Jews began to arrive and establish themselves in England,\r\nbut not until after the restoration of Charles II., in 1660, could it\r\nbe said that, as a body, they were settled in England. They arrived\r\nfrom time to time, and without any formal sanction being either granted\r\nor refused. One reason alleged at the time was, that the Jews were well\r\nknown to be money-lenders, and Charles and his courtiers were as well\r\nknown money-borrowers!\r\n\r\nI now come to the character and establishment of the Jews in the\r\ncapacity in which I have more especially to describe them--as\r\nstreet-traders. There appears no reason to doubt that they commenced\r\ntheir principal street traffic, the collecting of old clothes, soon\r\nafter their settlement in London. At any rate the cry and calling of\r\nthe Jew old clothesman were so established, 30 or 40 years after their\r\nreturn, or early in the last century, that one of them is delineated\r\nin Tempest’s “Cries of London,” published about that period. In this\r\nwork the street Jew is represented as very different in his appearance\r\nto that which he presents in our day. Instead of merely a dingy bag,\r\nhung empty over his arm, or carried, when partially or wholly filled,\r\non his shoulder, he is depicted as wearing, or rather carrying, three\r\ncocked hats, one over the other, upon his head; a muff, with a scarf\r\nor large handkerchief over it, is attached to his right hand and arm,\r\nand two dress swords occupy his left hand. The apparel which he himself\r\nwears is of the full-skirted style of the day, and his long hair, or\r\nperiwig, descends to his shoulders. This difference in appearance,\r\nhowever, between the street Jew of 1700 and of a century and a half\r\nlater, is simply the effect of circumstances, and indicates no change\r\nin the character of the man. Were it now the fashion for gentlemen to\r\nwear muffs, swords, and cocked hats, the Jew would again have them in\r\nhis possession.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century the popular feeling ran very high against\r\nthe Jews, although to the masses they were almost strangers, except\r\nas men employed in the not-very-formidable occupation of collecting\r\nand vending second-hand clothes. The old feeling against them seems to\r\nhave lingered among the English people, and their own greed in many\r\ninstances engendered other and lawful causes of dislike, by their\r\nresorting to unlawful and debasing pursuits. They were considered--and\r\nwith that exaggeration of belief dear to any ignorant community--as an\r\nentire people of misers, usurers, extortioners, receivers of stolen\r\ngoods, cheats, brothel-keepers, sheriff’s-officers, clippers and\r\nsweaters of the coin of the realm, gaming-house keepers; in fine, the\r\ncharges, or rather the accusations, of carrying on every disreputable\r\ntrade, and none else, were “bundled at their doors.” That there was\r\ntoo much foundation for many of these accusations, and still _is_, no\r\nreasonable Jew can now deny; that the wholesale prejudice against them\r\nwas absurd, is equally indisputable.\r\n\r\nSo strong was this popular feeling against the Israelites, that it\r\nnot only influenced, and not only controlled the legislature, but it\r\ncoerced the Houses of Parliament to repeal, in 1754, an act which they\r\nhad passed the previous session, and that act was merely to enable\r\nforeign Jews to be naturalized without being required to take the\r\nsacrament! It was at that time, and while the popular ferment was at\r\nits height, unsafe for a Hebrew old clothesman, however harmless a man,\r\nand however long and well known on his beat, to ply his street-calling\r\nopenly; for he was often beaten and maltreated. Mobs, riots,\r\npillagings, and attacks upon the houses of the Jews were frequent, and\r\none of the favourite cries of the mob was certainly among the most\r\npreposterously stupid of any which ever tickled the ear and satisfied\r\nthe mind of the ignorant:--\r\n\r\n  “No Jews!\r\n  No wooden shoes!!”\r\n\r\nSome mob-leader, with a taste for rhyme, had in this distich cleverly\r\nblended the prejudice against the Jews with the easily excited but\r\nvague fears of a French invasion, which was in some strange way\r\ntypified to the apprehensions of the vulgar as connected with slavery,\r\npopery, the compulsory wearing of wooden shoes (_sabots_), and the\r\neating of frogs! And this sort of feeling was often revenged on the\r\nstreet-Jew, as a man mixed up with wooden shoes! Cumberland, in the\r\ncomedy of “The Jew,” and some time afterwards Miss Edgeworth, in the\r\ntale of “Harrington and Ormond,” and both at the request of Jews, wrote\r\nto moderate this rabid prejudice.\r\n\r\nIn what estimation the street, and, incidentally, all classes of Jews\r\nare held at the present time, will be seen in the course of my remarks;\r\nand in the narratives to be given. I may here observe, however, that\r\namong some the dominant feeling against the Jews on account of their\r\nfaith still flourishes, as is shown by the following statement:--A\r\ngentleman of my acquaintance was one evening, about twilight, walking\r\ndown Brydges-street, Covent-garden, when an elderly Jew was preceding\r\nhim, apparently on his return from a day’s work, as an old clothesman.\r\nHis bag accidentally touched the bonnet of a dashing woman of the town,\r\nwho was passing, and she turned round, abused the Jew, and spat at him,\r\nsaying with an oath: “You old rags humbug! _You_ can’t do that!”--an\r\nallusion to a vulgar notion that Jews have been unable to do more than\r\n_slobber_, since spitting on the Saviour.\r\n\r\nThe number of Jews now in England is computed at 35,000. This is\r\nthe result at which the Chief Rabbi arrived a few years ago, after\r\ncollecting all the statistical information at his command. Of these\r\n35,000, more than one-half, or about 18,000, reside in London. I am\r\ninformed that there may now be a small increase to this population, but\r\nonly small, for many Jews have emigrated--some to California. A few\r\nyears ago--a circumstance mentioned in my account of the Street-Sellers\r\nof Jewellery--there were a number of Jews known as “hawkers,” or\r\n“travellers,” who traverse every part of England selling watches,\r\ngold and silver pencil-cases, eye-glasses, and all the more portable\r\ndescriptions of jewellery, as well as thermometers, barometers,\r\ntelescopes, and microscopes. This trade is now little pursued, except\r\nby the stationary dealers; and the Jews who carried it on, and who were\r\nchiefly foreign Jews, have emigrated to America. The foreign Jews who,\r\nthough a fluctuating body, are always numerous in London, are included\r\nin the computation of 18,000; of this population two-thirds reside in\r\nthe city, or the streets adjacent to the eastern boundaries of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE TRADES AND LOCALITIES OF THE STREET-JEWS.\r\n\r\nThe trades which the Jews most affect, I was told by one of themselves,\r\nare those in which, as they describe it, “there’s a chance;” that\r\nis, they prefer a trade in such commodity as is not subjected to a\r\nfixed price, so that there may be abundant scope for speculation, and\r\nsomething like a gambler’s chance for profit or loss. In this way, Sir\r\nWalter Scott has said, trade has “all the fascination of gambling,\r\nwithout the moral guilt;” but the absence of moral guilt in connection\r\nwith such trading is certainly dubious.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale trades in foreign commodities which are now principally\r\nor solely in the hands of the Jews, often as importers and exporters,\r\nare, watches and jewels, sponges--fruits, especially green fruits,\r\nsuch as oranges, lemons, grapes, walnuts, cocoa-nuts, &c., and dates\r\namong dried fruits--shells, tortoises, parrots and foreign birds,\r\ncuriosities, ostrich feathers, snuffs, cigars, and pipes; but cigars\r\nfar more extensively at one time.\r\n\r\nThe localities in which these wholesale and retail traders reside are\r\nmostly at the East-end--indeed the Jews of London, as a congregated\r\nbody, have been, from the times when their numbers were sufficient to\r\ninstitute a “settlement” or “colony,” peculiar to themselves, always\r\nresident in the eastern quarter of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nOf course a wealthy Jew millionaire--merchant, stock-jobber, or\r\nstock-broker--resides where he pleases--in a villa near the Marquis\r\nof Hertford’s in the Regent’s-park, a mansion near the Duke of\r\nWellington’s in Piccadilly, a house and grounds at Clapham or\r\nStamford-hill; but these are exceptions. The quarters of the Jews\r\nare not difficult to describe. The trading-class in the capacity of\r\nshopkeepers, warehousemen, or manufacturers, are the thickest in\r\nHoundsditch, Aldgate, and the Minories, more especially as regards\r\nthe “swag-shops” and the manufacture and sale of wearing apparel.\r\nThe wholesale dealers in fruit are in Duke’s-place and Pudding-lane\r\n(Thames-street), but the superior retail Jew fruiterers--some of\r\nwhose shops are remarkable for the beauty of their fruit--are in\r\nCheapside, Oxford-street, Piccadilly, and most of all in Covent-garden\r\nmarket. The inferior jewellers (some of whom deal with the first\r\nshops) are also at the East-end, about Whitechapel, Bevis-marks,\r\nand Houndsditch; the wealthier goldsmiths and watchmakers having,\r\nlike other tradesmen of the class, their shops in the superior\r\nthoroughfares. The great congregation of working watchmakers is\r\nin Clerkenwell, but in that locality there are only a few Jews.\r\nThe Hebrew dealers in second-hand garments, and second-hand wares\r\ngenerally, are located about Petticoat-lane, the peculiarities of which\r\nplace I have lately described. The manufacturers of such things as\r\ncigars, pencils, and sealing-wax; the wholesale importers of sponge,\r\nbristles and toys, the dealers in quills and in “looking-glasses,”\r\nreside in large private-looking houses, when display is not needed\r\nfor purposes of business, in such parts as Maunsell-street, Great\r\nPrescott-street, Great Ailie-street, Leman-street, and other parts\r\nof the eastern quarter known as Goodman’s-fields. The wholesale\r\ndealers in foreign birds and shells, and in the many foreign things\r\nknown as “curiosities,” reside in East Smithfield, Ratcliffe-highway,\r\nHigh-street (Shadwell), or in some of the parts adjacent to the Thames.\r\nIn the long range of river-side streets, stretching from the Tower\r\nto Poplar and Blackwall, are Jews, who fulfil the many capacities\r\nof slop-sellers, &c., called into exercise by the requirements of\r\nseafaring people on their return from or commencement of a voyage. A\r\nfew Jews keep boarding-houses for sailors in Shadwell and Wapping. Of\r\nthe localities and abodes of the poorest of the Jews I shall speak\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nConcerning the street-trades pursued by the Jews, I believe there\r\nis not at present a single one of which they can be said to have a\r\nmonopoly; nor in any one branch of the street-traffic are there so many\r\nof the Jew traders as there were a few years back.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable change is thus to be accounted for. Strange as the\r\nfact may appear, the Jew has been undersold in the streets, and he\r\nhas been beaten on what might be called his own ground--the buying of\r\nold clothes. The Jew boys, and the feebler and elder Jews, had, until\r\nsome twelve or fifteen years back, almost the monopoly of orange and\r\nlemon street-selling, or street-hawking. The costermonger class had\r\npossession of the theatre doors and the approaches to the theatres;\r\nthey had, too, occasionally their barrows full of oranges; but the Jews\r\nwere the daily, assiduous, and itinerant street-sellers of this most\r\npopular of foreign, and perhaps of all, fruits. In their hopes of sale\r\nthey followed any one a mile if encouraged, even by a few approving\r\nglances. The great theatre of this traffic was in the stage-coach\r\nyards in such inns as the Bull and Mouth, (St. Martin’s-le-Grand),\r\nthe Belle Sauvage (Ludgate-hill), the Saracen’s Head (Snow-hill), the\r\nBull (Aldgate), the Swan-with-two-Necks (Lad-lane, City), the George\r\nand Blue Boar (Holborn), the White Horse (Fetter-lane), and other such\r\nplaces. They were seen too, “with all their eyes about them,” as one\r\ninformant expressed it, outside the inns where the coaches stopped\r\nto take up passengers--at the White Horse Cellar in Piccadilly, for\r\ninstance, and the Angel and the (now defunct) Peacock in Islington.\r\nA commercial traveller told me that he could never leave town by any\r\n“mail” or “stage,” without being besieged by a small army of Jew boys,\r\nwho most pertinaciously offered him oranges, lemons, sponges, combs,\r\npocket-books, pencils, sealing-wax, paper, many-bladed pen-knives,\r\nrazors, pocket-mirrors, and shaving-boxes--as if a man could not\r\npossibly quit the metropolis without requiring a stock of such\r\ncommodities. In the whole of these trades, unless in some degree in\r\nsponges and blacklead-pencils, the Jew is now out-numbered or displaced.\r\n\r\nI have before alluded to the underselling of the Jew boy by the Irish\r\nboy in the street-orange trade; but the characteristics of the change\r\nare so peculiar, that a further notice is necessary. It is curious to\r\nobserve that the most assiduous, and hitherto the most successful of\r\nstreet-traders, were supplanted, not by a more persevering or more\r\nskilful body of street-sellers, but simply by a more _starving_ body.\r\n\r\nSome few years since poor Irish people, and chiefly those connected\r\nwith the culture of the land, “came over” to this country in great\r\nnumbers, actuated either by vague hopes of “bettering themselves” by\r\nemigration, or working on the railways, or else influenced by the\r\nrestlessness common to an impoverished people. These men, when unable\r\nto obtain employment, without scruple became street-sellers. Not\r\nonly did the adults resort to street-traffic, generally in its simplest\r\nforms, such as hawking fruit, but the children, by whom they were\r\naccompanied from Ireland, in great numbers, were put into the trade;\r\nand if two or three children earned 2_d._ a day each, and their parents\r\n5_d._ or 6_d._ each, or even 4_d._, the subsistence of the family was\r\nbetter than they could obtain in the midst of the miseries of the\r\nsouthern and western part of the Sister Isle. An Irish boy of fourteen,\r\nhaving to support himself by street-trade, as was often the case, owing\r\nto the death of parents and to divers casualties, would undersell the\r\nJew boys similarly circumstanced.\r\n\r\nThe Irish boy could live _harder_ than the Jew--often in his own\r\ncountry he subsisted on a stolen turnip a day; he could lodge\r\nharder--lodge for 1_d._ a night in any noisome den, or sleep in the\r\nopen air, which is seldom done by the Jew boy; he could dispense with\r\nthe use of shoes and stockings--a dispensation at which his rival in\r\ntrade revolted; he drank only water, or if he took tea or coffee,\r\nit was as a meal, and not merely as a beverage; to crown the whole,\r\nthe city-bred Jew boy required some evening recreation, the penny or\r\ntwopenny concert, or a game at draughts or dominoes; but this the\r\nIrish boy, country bred, never thought of, for _his_ sole luxury was a\r\ndeep sleep, and, being regardless or ignorant of all such recreations,\r\nhe worked longer hours, and so sold more oranges, than his Hebrew\r\ncompetitor. Thus, as the Munster or Connaught lad could live on less\r\nthan the young denizen of Petticoat-lane, he could sell at smaller\r\nprofit, and did so sell, until gradually the Hebrew youths were\r\ndisplaced by the Irish in the street orange trade.\r\n\r\nIt is the same, or the same in a degree, with other street-trades,\r\nwhich were at one time all but monopolised by the Jew adults. Among\r\nthese were the street-sale of spectacles and sponges. The prevalence\r\nof slop-work and slop-wages, and the frequent difficulty of obtaining\r\nproperly-remunerated employment--the pinch of want, in short--have\r\ndriven many mechanics to street-traffic; so that the numbers of\r\nstreet-traffickers have been augmented, while no small portion of the\r\nnew comers have adopted the more knowing street avocations, formerly\r\npursued only by the Jews.\r\n\r\nOf the other class of street-traders who have interfered largely with\r\nthe old-clothes trade, which, at one time, people seemed to consider a\r\nsort of birthright among the Jews, I have already spoken, when treating\r\nof the dealings of the crockmen in bartering glass and crockery-ware\r\nfor second-hand apparel. These traders now obtain as many old clothes\r\nas the Jew clothes men themselves; for, with a great number of\r\n“ladies,” the offer of an ornament of glass or spar, or of a beautiful\r\nand fragrant plant, is more attractive than the offer of a small sum of\r\nmoney, for the purchase of the left-off garments of the family.\r\n\r\nThe crockmen are usually strong and in the prime of youth or manhood,\r\nand are capable of carrying heavy burdens of glass or china-wares, for\r\nwhich the Jews are either incompetent or disinclined.\r\n\r\nSome of the Jews which have been thus displaced from the street-traffic\r\nhave emigrated to America, with the assistance of their brethren.\r\n\r\nThe principal street-trades of the Jews are now in sponges, spectacles,\r\ncombs, pencils, accordions, cakes, sweetmeats, drugs, and fruits of all\r\nkinds; but, in all these trades, unless perhaps in drugs, they are in a\r\nminority compared with the “Christian” street-sellers.\r\n\r\nThere is not among the Jew street-sellers generally anything of the\r\nconcubinage or cohabitation common among the costermongers. Marriage is\r\nthe rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE JEW OLD-CLOTHES MEN.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the appearance of the street-Jews, engaged in the\r\npurchase of second-hand clothes, was different to what it is at the\r\npresent time. The Jew then had far more of the distinctive garb and\r\naspect of a foreigner. He not unfrequently wore the gabardine, which is\r\nnever seen now in the streets, but some of the long loose frock coats\r\nworn by the Jew clothes’ buyers resemble it. At that period, too, the\r\nJew’s long beard was far more distinctive than it is in this hirsute\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIn other respects the street-Jew is unchanged. Now, as during the\r\nlast century, he traverses every street, square, and road, with the\r\nmonotonous cry, sometimes like a bleat, of “Clo’! Clo’!” On this head,\r\nhowever, I have previously remarked, when describing the street Jew of\r\na hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JEW OLD-CLOTHES MAN.\r\n\r\nCLO’, CLO’, CLO’.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nIn an inquiry into the condition of the old-clothes dealers a year and\r\na half ago, a Jew gave me the following account. He told me, at the\r\ncommencement of his statement, that he was of opinion that his people\r\nwere far more speculative than the Gentiles, and therefore the English\r\nliked better to deal with them. “Our people,” he said, “will be out all\r\nday in the wet, and begrudge themselves a bit of anything to eat till\r\nthey go home, and then, may be, they’ll gamble away their crown, just\r\nfor the love of speculation.” My informant, who could write or speak\r\nseveral languages, and had been 50 years in the business, then said, “I\r\nam no bigot; indeed I do not care where I buy my meat, so long as I can\r\nget it. I often go into the Minories and buy some, without looking to\r\nhow it has been killed, or whether it has a seal on it or not.”\r\n\r\nHe then gave me some account of the Jewish children, and the number\r\nof men in the trade, which I have embodied under the proper heads.\r\nThe itinerant Jew clothes man, he told me, was generally the son of a\r\nformer old-clothes man, but some were cigar-makers, or pencil-makers,\r\ntaking to the clothes business when those trades were slack; but that\r\nnineteen out of twenty had been born to it. If the parents of the\r\nJew boy are poor, and the boy a sharp lad, he generally commences\r\nbusiness at ten years of age, by selling lemons, or some trifle in\r\nthe streets, and so, as he expressed it, the boy “gets a round,” or\r\nstreet-connection, by becoming known to the neighbourhoods he visits.\r\nIf he sees a servant, he will, when selling his lemons, ask if she\r\nhave any old shoes or old clothes, and offer to be a purchaser. If the\r\nclothes should come to more than the Jew boy has in his pocket, he\r\nleaves what silver he has as “an earnest upon them,” and then seeks\r\nsome regular Jew clothes man, who will advance the purchase money.\r\nThis the old Jew agrees to do upon the understanding that he is to\r\nhave “half Rybeck,” that is, a moiety of the profit, and then he will\r\naccompany the boy to the house, to pass his judgment on the goods, and\r\nsatisfy himself that the stripling has not made a blind bargain, an\r\nerror into which he very rarely falls. After this he goes with the lad\r\nto Petticoat-lane, and there they share whatever money the clothes may\r\nbring over and above what has been paid for them. By such means the\r\nJew boy gets his knowledge of the old-clothes business; and so quick\r\nare these lads generally, that in the course of two months they will\r\nacquire sufficient experience in connection with the trade to begin\r\ndealing on their own account. There are some, he told me, as sharp at\r\n15 as men of 50.\r\n\r\n“It is very seldom,” my informant stated, “very seldom indeed, that\r\na Jew clothes man takes away any of the property of the house he may\r\nbe called into. I expect there’s a good many of ’em,” he continued,\r\nfor he sometimes spoke of his co-traders, as if they were not of his\r\nown class, “is fond of cheating--that is, they won’t mind giving only\r\n2_s._ for a thing that’s worth 5_s._ They are fond of money, and will\r\ndo almost anything to get it. Jews are perhaps the most money-loving\r\npeople in all England. There are certainly some old-clothes men who\r\nwill buy articles at such a price that they must know them to have\r\nbeen stolen. Their rule, however, is to ask no questions, and to get\r\nas cheap an article as possible. A Jew clothes man is seldom or never\r\nseen in liquor. They gamble for money, either at their own homes or at\r\npublic-houses. The favourite games are tossing, dominoes, and cards.\r\nI was informed, by one of the people, that he had seen as much as\r\n30_l._ in silver and gold lying upon the ground when two parties had\r\nbeen playing at throwing three halfpence in the air. On a Saturday,\r\nsome gamble away the morning and the greater part of the afternoon.”\r\n[Saturday, I need hardly say, is the Hebrew Sabbath.] “They meet\r\nin some secret back place, about ten, and begin playing for ‘one a\r\ntime’--that is, tossing up three halfpence, and staking 1_s._ on the\r\nresult. Other Jews, and a few Christians, will gather round and bet.\r\nSometimes the bets laid by the Jew bystanders are as high as 2_l._\r\neach; and on more than one occasion the old-clothes men have wagered as\r\nmuch as 50_l._, but only after great gains at gambling. Some, if they\r\n_can_, will cheat, by means of a halfpenny with a head or a tail on\r\nboth sides, called a ‘gray.’ The play lasts till the Sabbath is nearly\r\nover, and then they go to business or the theatre. They seldom or never\r\nsay a word while they are losing, but merely stamp on the ground; it\r\nis dangerous, though, to interfere when luck runs against them. The\r\nrule is, when a man is losing to let him alone. I have known them play\r\nfor three hours together, and nothing be said all that time but ‘head’\r\nor ‘tail.’ They seldom go to synagogue, and on a Sunday evening have\r\ncard parties at their own houses. They seldom eat anything on their\r\nrounds. The reason is, not because they object to eat meat killed by\r\na Christian, but because they are afraid of losing a ‘deal,’ or the\r\nchance of buying a lot of old clothes by delay. They are generally\r\ntoo lazy to light their own fires before they start of a morning, and\r\nnineteen out of twenty obtain their breakfasts at the coffee-shops\r\nabout Houndsditch.\r\n\r\n“When they return from their day’s work they have mostly some stew\r\nready, prepared by their parents or wife. If they are not family men\r\nthey go to an eating-house. This is sometimes a Jewish house, but if\r\nno one is looking they creep into a Christian ‘cook-shop,’ not being\r\nparticular about eating ‘tryfer’--that is, meat which has been killed\r\nby a Christian. Those that are single generally go to a neighbour and\r\nagree with him to be boarded on the Sabbath; and for this the charge\r\nis generally about 2_s._ 6_d._ On a Saturday there’s cold fish for\r\nbreakfast and supper; indeed, a Jew would pawn the shirt off his back\r\nsooner than go without fish then; and in holiday-time he _will_ have\r\nit, if he has to get it out of the stones. It is not reckoned a holiday\r\nunless there’s fish.”\r\n\r\n“Forty years ago I have made as much as 5_l._ in a week by the purchase\r\nof old clothes in the streets,” said a Jew informant. “Upon an average\r\nthen, I could earn weekly about 2_l._ But now things are different.\r\nPeople are more wide awake. Every one knows the value of an old coat\r\nnow-a-days. The women know more than the men. The general average, I\r\nthink, take the good weeks with the bad throughout the year, is about\r\n1_l._ a week; some weeks we get 2_l._, and some scarcely nothing.”\r\n\r\nI was told by a Jewish professional gentleman that the account of the\r\n_spirit_ of gambling prevalent among his people was correct, but the\r\namounts said to be staked, he thought, rare or exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe Jew old-clothes men are generally far more cleanly in their habits\r\nthan the poorer classes of English people. Their hands they always wash\r\nbefore their meals, and this is done whether the party be a strict Jew\r\nor “Meshumet,” a convert, or apostate from Judaism. Neither will the\r\nIsraelite ever use the same knife to cut his meat that he previously\r\nused to spread his butter, and he will not even put his meat on a plate\r\nthat has had butter on it; nor will he use for his soup the spoon that\r\nhas had melted butter in it. This objection to mix butter with meat is\r\ncarried so far, that, after partaking of the one, Jews will not eat\r\nof the other for the space of two hours. The Jews are generally, when\r\nmarried, most exemplary family men. There are few fonder fathers than\r\nthey are, and they will starve themselves sooner than their wives and\r\nchildren should want. Whatever their faults may be, they are good\r\nfathers, husbands, and sons. Their principal characteristic is their\r\nextreme love of money; and, though the strict Jew does not trade\r\nhimself on the Sabbath, he may not object to employ either one of his\r\ntribe, or a Gentile, to do so for him.\r\n\r\nThe capital required for commencing in the old-clothes line is\r\ngenerally about 1_l._ This the Jew frequently borrows, especially after\r\nholiday-time, for then he has generally spent all his earnings, unless\r\nhe be a provident man. When his stock-money is exhausted, he goes\r\neither to a neighbour or to a publican in the vicinity, and borrows\r\n1_l._ on the Monday morning, “to strike a light with,” as he calls it,\r\nand agrees to return it on the Friday evening, with 1_s._ interest for\r\nthe loan. This he always pays back. If he was to sell the coat off his\r\nback he would do this, I am told, because to fail in so doing would\r\nbe to prevent his obtaining any stock-money for the future. With this\r\ncapital he starts on his rounds about eight in the morning, and I am\r\nassured he will frequently begin his work without tasting food, rather\r\nthan break into the borrowed stock-money. Each man has his particular\r\nwalk, and never interferes with that of his neighbour; indeed, while\r\nupon another’s beat he will seldom cry for clothes. Sometimes they go\r\nhalf “Rybeck” together--that is, they will share the profits of the\r\nday’s business, and when they agree to do this the one will take one\r\nstreet, and the other another. The lower the neighbourhood the more\r\nold clothes are there for sale. At the east end of the town they like\r\nthe neighbourhoods frequented by sailors, and there they purchase\r\nof the girls and the women the sailors’ jackets and trowsers. But\r\nthey buy most of the Petticoat-lane, the Old-Clothes Exchange, and\r\nthe marine-store dealers; for as the Jew clothes man never travels\r\nthe streets by night-time, the parties who then have old clothes to\r\ndispose of usually sell them to the marine-store or second-hand dealers\r\nover-night, and the Jew buys them in the morning. The first thing that\r\nhe does on his rounds is to seek out these shops, and see what he can\r\npick up there. A very great amount of business is done by the Jew\r\nclothes man at the marine-store shops at the west as well as at the\r\neast end of London.\r\n\r\nAt the West-end the itinerant clothes men prefer the mews at the back\r\nof gentlemen’s houses to all other places, or else the streets where\r\nthe little tradesmen and small genteel families reside. My informant\r\nassured me that he had once bought a Bishop’s hat of his lordship’s\r\nservant for 1_s._ 6_d._ on a Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nThese traders, as I have elsewhere stated, live at the East-end of the\r\ntown. The greater number of them reside in Portsoken Ward, Houndsditch;\r\nand their favourite localities in this district are either Cobb’s-yard,\r\nRoper’s-building, or Wentworth-street. They mostly occupy small houses,\r\nabout 4_s._ 6_d._ a week rent, and live with their families. They are\r\ngenerally sober men. It is seldom that a Jew leaves his house and owes\r\nhis landlord money; and if his goods should be seized the rest of his\r\ntribe will go round and collect what is owing.\r\n\r\nThe rooms occupied by the old-clothes men are far from being so\r\ncomfortable as those of the English artizans whose earnings are not\r\nsuperior to the gains of these clothes men. Those which I saw had all\r\na littered look; the furniture was old and scant, and the apartment\r\nseemed neither shop, parlour, nor bed-room. For domestic and family\r\nmen, as some of the Jew old-clothes men are, they seem very indifferent\r\nto the comforts of a home.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of “Tryfer,” or meat killed in the Christian fashion.\r\nNow, the meat killed according to the Jewish law is known as “Coshar,”\r\nand a strict Jew will eat none other. In one of my letters in the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_ on the meat markets of London, there appeared the\r\nfollowing statement, respecting the Jew butchers in Whitechapel-market.\r\n\r\n“To a portion of the meat here exposed for sale, may be seen attached\r\nthe peculiar seal which shows that the animal was killed conformably\r\nto the Jewish rites. According to the injunctions of this religion the\r\nbeast must die from its throat being cut, instead of being knocked\r\non the head. The slaughterer of the cattle for Jewish consumption,\r\nmoreover, must be a Jew. Two slaughterers are appointed by the Jewish\r\nauthorities of the synagogue, and they can employ others, who must be\r\nlikewise Jews, as assistants. The slaughterers I saw were quiet-looking\r\nand quiet-mannered men. When the animal is slaughtered and skinned,\r\nan examiner (also appointed by the synagogue) carefully inspects the\r\n‘inside.’ ‘If the lights be grown to the ribs,’ said my informant, who\r\nhad had many years’ experience in this branch of the meat trade, ‘or if\r\nthe lungs have any disease, or if there be any disease anywhere, the\r\nmeat is pronounced unfit for the food of the Jews, and is sent entire\r\nto a carcase butcher to be sold to the Christians. This, however,\r\ndoes not happen once in 20 times.’ To the parts exposed for sale,\r\nwhen the slaughtering has been according to the Jewish law, there is\r\nattached a leaden seal, stamped in Hebrew characters with the name of\r\nthe examining party sealing. In this way, as I ascertained from the\r\nslaughterers, are killed weekly from 120 to 140 bullocks, from 400 to\r\n500 sheep and lambs, and about 30 calves. All the parts of the animal\r\nthus slaughtered may be and are eaten by the Jews, but three-fourths\r\nof the purchase of this meat is confined, as regards the Jews, to the\r\nfore-quarters of the respective animals; the hind-quarters, being the\r\nchoicer parts, are sent to Newgate or Leadenhall-markets for sale on\r\ncommission.” The Hebrew butchers consider that the Christian mode of\r\nslaughter is a far less painful death to the ox than was the Jewish.\r\n\r\nI am informed that of the Jew Old-Clothes Men there are now only from\r\n500 to 600 in London; at one time there might have been 1000. Their\r\naverage earnings may be something short of 20_s._ a week in second-hand\r\nclothes alone; but the gains are difficult to estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A JEW STREET-SELLER.\r\n\r\nAn elderly man, who, at the time I saw him, was vending spectacles, or\r\nbartering them for old clothes, old books, or any second-hand articles,\r\ngave me an account of his street-life, but it presented little\r\nremarkable beyond the not unusual vicissitudes of the lives of those of\r\nhis class.\r\n\r\nHe had been in every street-trade, and had on four occasions travelled\r\nall over England, selling quills, sealing-wax, pencils, sponges,\r\nbraces, cheap or superior jewellery, thermometers, and pictures. He\r\nhad sold barometers in the mountainous parts of Cumberland, sometimes\r\nwalking for hours without seeing man or woman. “_I liked it then_,”\r\nhe said, “_for I was young and strong, and didn’t care to sleep twice\r\nin the same town_. I was afterwards in the old-clothes line. I buy a\r\nfew odd hats and light things still, but I’m not able to carry heavy\r\nweights, as my breath is getting rather short.” [I find that the Jews\r\ngenerally object to the more laborious kinds of street-traffic.] “Yes,\r\nI’ve been twice to Ireland, and sold a good many quills in Dublin,\r\nfor I crossed over from Liverpool. Quills and wax were a great trade\r\nwith us once; now it’s quite different. I’ve had as much as 60_l._\r\nof my own, and that more than half-a-dozen times, but all of it\r\nwent in speculations. Yes, some went in gambling. I had a share in\r\na gaming-booth at the races, for three years. O, I dare say that’s\r\nmore than 20 years back; but we did very little good. There was such\r\nfees to pay for the tent on a race-ground, and often such delays\r\nbetween the races in the different towns, and bribes to be given to\r\nthe town-officers--such as town-sergeants and chief constables, and\r\nI hardly know who--and so many expenses altogether, that the profits\r\nwere mostly swamped. Once at Newcastle races there was a fight among\r\nthe pitmen, and our tent was in their way, and was demolished almost to\r\nbits. A deal of the money was lost or stolen. I don’t know how much,\r\nbut not near so much as my partners wanted to make out. I wasn’t on the\r\nspot just at the time. I got married after that, and took a shop in the\r\nsecond-hand clothes line in Bristol, but my wife died in child-bed in\r\nless than a year, and the shop didn’t answer; so I got sick of it, and\r\nat last got rid of it. O, I work both the country and London still. I\r\nshall take a turn into Kent in a day or two. I suppose I clear between\r\n10_s._ and 20_s._ a week in anything, and as I’ve only myself, I do\r\nmiddling, and am ready for another chance if any likely speculation\r\noffers. I lodge with a relation, and sometimes live with his family.\r\nNo, I never touch any meat but ‘Coshar.’ I suppose my meat now costs me\r\n6_d._ or 7_d._ a day, but it has cost me ten times that--and 2_d._ for\r\nbeer in addition.”\r\n\r\nI am informed that there are about 50 adult Jews (besides old-clothes\r\nmen) in the streets selling fruit, cakes, pencils, spectacles, sponge,\r\naccordions, drugs, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE JEW-BOY STREET-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nI have ascertained, and from sources where no ignorance on the subject\r\ncould prevail, that there are now in the streets of London, rather more\r\nthan 100 Jew-boys engaged principally in fruit and cake-selling in the\r\nstreets. Very few Jewesses are itinerant street-sellers. Most of the\r\nolder Jews thus engaged have been street-sellers from their boyhood.\r\nThe young Jews who ply in street-callings, however, are all men in\r\nmatters of traffic, almost before they cease, in years, to be children.\r\nIn addition to the Jew-boy street-sellers above enumerated, there are\r\nfrom 50 to 100, but usually about 50, who are occasional, or “casual”\r\nstreet-traders, vending for the most part cocoa-nuts and grapes, and\r\nconfining their sales chiefly to the Sundays.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the street-Jew boys, a Hebrew gentleman said to\r\nme: “When we speak of street-Jew boys, it should be understood, that\r\nthe great majority of them are but little more conversant with or\r\ninterested in the religion of their fathers, than are the costermonger\r\nboys of whom you have written. They are Jews by the accident of their\r\nbirth, as others in the same way, with equal ignorance of the assumed\r\nfaith, are Christians.”\r\n\r\nI received from a Jew boy the following account of his trading pursuits\r\nand individual aspirations. There was somewhat of a thickness in his\r\nutterance, otherwise his speech was but little distinguishable from\r\nthat of an English street-boy. His physiognomy was decidedly Jewish,\r\nbut not of the handsomer type. His hair was light-coloured, but clean,\r\nand apparently well brushed, without being oiled, or, as I heard a\r\nstreet-boy style it, “greased”; it was long, and he said his aunt told\r\nhim it “wanted cutting sadly;” but he “liked it that way;” indeed, he\r\nkept dashing his curls from his eyes, and back from his temples, as\r\nhe was conversing, as if he were somewhat vain of doing so. He was\r\ndressed in a corduroy suit, old but not ragged, and wore a tolerably\r\nclean, very coarse, and altogether buttonless shirt, which he said\r\n“was made for one bigger than me, sir.” He had bought it for 9-1/2_d._\r\nin Petticoat-lane, and accounted it a bargain, as its wear would be\r\ndurable. He was selling sponges when I saw him, and of the commonest\r\nkind, offering a large piece for 3_d._, which (he admitted) would be\r\nrubbed to bits in no time. This sponge, I should mention, is frequently\r\n“dressed” with sulphuric acid, and an eminent surgeon informed me that\r\non his servant attempting to clean his black dress coat with a sponge\r\nthat he had newly bought in the streets, the colour of the garment, to\r\nhis horror, changed to a bright purple. The Jew boy said--\r\n\r\n“I believe I’m twelve. I’ve been to school, but it’s long since, and my\r\nmother was very ill then, and I was forced to go out in the streets to\r\nhave a chance. I never was kept to school. I can’t read; I’ve forgot\r\nall about it. I’d rather now that I could read, but very likely I could\r\nsoon learn if I could only spare time, but if I stay long in the house\r\nI feel sick; it’s not healthy. O, no, sir, inside or out it would be\r\nall the same to me, just to make a living and keep my health. I can’t\r\nsay how long it is since I began to sell, it’s a good long time; one\r\nmust do something. I could keep myself now, and do sometimes, but my\r\nfather--I live with him (my mother’s dead) is often laid up. Would you\r\nlike to see him, sir? He knows a deal. No, he can’t write, but he can\r\nread a little. Can I speak Hebrew? Well, I know what you mean. O, no,\r\nI can’t. I don’t go to synagogue; I haven’t time. My father goes, but\r\nonly sometimes; so he says, and he tells me to look out, for we must\r\nboth go by-and-by.” [I began to ask him what he knew of Joseph, and\r\nothers recorded in the Old Testament, but he bristled up, and asked\r\nif I wanted to make a Meshumet (a convert) of him?] “I have sold all\r\nsorts of things,” he continued, “oranges, and lemons, and sponges,\r\nand nuts, and sweets. I should like to have a real good ginger-beer\r\nfountain of my own; but I must wait, and there’s many in the trade.\r\nI only go with boys of my own sort. I sell to all sorts of boys, but\r\nthat’s nothing. Very likely they’re Christians, but that’s nothing to\r\nme. I don’t know what’s the difference between a Jew and Christian,\r\nand I don’t want to talk about it. The Meshumets are never any good.\r\nAnybody will tell you that. Yes, I like music and can sing a bit. I\r\nget to a penny and sometimes a two-penny concert. No, I haven’t been\r\nto Sussex Hall--I know where it is--I shouldn’t understand it. You get\r\nin for nothing, that’s one thing. I’ve heard of Baron Rothschild. He\r\nhas more money than I could count in shillings in a year. I don’t know\r\nabout his wanting to get into parliament, or what it means; but he’s\r\nsure to do it or anything else, with his money. He’s very charitable,\r\nI’ve heard. I don’t know whether he’s a German Jew, or a Portegee,\r\nor what. He’s a cut above me, a precious sight. I only wish he was\r\nmy uncle. I can’t say what I should do if I had his money. Perhaps I\r\nshould go a travelling, and see everything everywhere. I don’t know\r\nhow long the Jews have been in England; always perhaps. Yes, I know\r\nthere’s Jews in other countries. This sponge is Greek sponge, but I\r\ndon’t know where it’s grown, only it’s in foreign parts. Jerusalem!\r\nYes, I’ve heard of it. I’m of no tribe that I know of. I buy what I eat\r\nabout Petticoat-lane. No, I don’t like fish, but the stews, and the\r\nonions with them is beautiful for two-pence; you may get a pennor’th.\r\nThe pickles--cowcumbers is best--are stunning. But they’re plummiest\r\nwith a bit of cheese or anything cold--that’s my opinion, but you may\r\nthink different. Pork! Ah! No, I never touched it; I’d as soon eat a\r\ncat; so would my father. No, sir, I don’t think pork smells nice in a\r\ncook-shop, but some Jew boys, as I knows, thinks it does. I don’t know\r\nwhy it shouldn’t be eaten, only that it’s wrong to eat it. No, I never\r\ntouched a ham-sandwich, but other Jew boys have, and laughed at it, I\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what I make in a week. I think I make as much on one\r\nthing as on another. I’ve sold strawberries, and cherries, and\r\ngooseberries, and nuts and walnuts in the season. O, as to what I\r\nmake, that’s nothing to nobody. Sometimes 6_d._ a day, sometimes\r\n1_s._; sometimes a little more, and sometimes nothing. No, I never\r\nsells inferior things if I can help it, but if one hasn’t stock-money\r\none must do as one can, but it isn’t so easy to try it on. There\r\nwas a boy beaten by a woman not long since for selling a big pottle\r\nof strawberries that was rubbish all under the toppers. It was all\r\nstrawberry leaves, and crushed strawberries, and such like. She wanted\r\nto take back from him the two-pence she’d paid for it, and got hold\r\nof his pockets and there was a regular fight, but she didn’t get a\r\nfarthing back though she tried her very hardest, ’cause he slipped from\r\nher and hooked it. So you see it’s dangerous to try it on.” [This last\r\nremark was made gravely enough, but the lad told of the feat with such\r\nmanifest glee, that I’m inclined to believe that he himself was the\r\nculprit in question.] “Yes, it was a Jew boy it happened to, but other\r\nboys in the streets is just the same. Do I like the streets? I can’t\r\nsay I do, there’s too little to be made in them. _No, I wouldn’t like\r\nto go to school, nor to be in a shop, nor be anybody’s servant but my\r\nown._ O, I don’t know what I shall be when I’m grown up. I shall take\r\nmy chance like others.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PURSUITS, DWELLINGS, TRAFFIC, ETC., OF THE JEW-BOY\r\nSTREET-SELLERS.\r\n\r\nTo speak of the street Jew-boys as regards their traffic, manners,\r\nhaunts, and associations, is to speak of the same class of boys who\r\nmay not be employed regularly in street-sale, but are the comrades of\r\nthose who are; a class, who, on any cessation of their employment in\r\ncigar manufactories, or indeed any capacity, will apply themselves\r\ntemporarily to street-selling, for it seems to these poor and\r\nuneducated lads a sort of natural vocation.\r\n\r\nThese youths, _uncontrolled_ or _incontrollable_ by their parents\r\n(who are of the lowest class of the Jews, and who often, I am told,\r\ncare little about the matter, so long as the child can earn his own\r\nmaintenance), frequently in the evenings, after their day’s work,\r\nresort to coffee-shops, in preference even to a cheap concert-room. In\r\nthese places they amuse themselves as men might do in a tavern where\r\nthe landlord leaves his guests to their own caprices. Sometimes one of\r\nthem reads aloud from some exciting or degrading book, the lads who\r\nare unable to read listening with all the intentness with which many\r\nof the uneducated attend to any one reading. The reading is, however,\r\nnot unfrequently interrupted by rude comments from the listeners. If\r\na newspaper be read, the “police,” or “crimes,” are mostly the parts\r\npreferred. But the most approved way of passing the evening, among the\r\nJew boys, is to play at draughts, dominoes, or cribbage, and to bet on\r\nthe play. Draughts and dominoes are unpractised among the costermonger\r\nboys, but some of the young Jews are adepts in those games.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who took an interest in the Jew lads told me that he had\r\noften heard the sort of reading and comments I have described, when\r\nhe had called to talk to and perhaps expostulate with, these youths\r\nin a coffee-shop, but he informed me that they seldom regarded any\r\nexpostulation, and seemed to be little restrained by the presence\r\nof a stranger, the lads all muttering and laughing in a box among\r\nthemselves. I saw seven of them, a little after eight in the evening,\r\nin a coffee-shop in the London-road,--although it is not much of a\r\nJewish locality,--and two of them were playing at draughts for coffee,\r\nwhile the others looked on, betting halfpennies or pennies with all the\r\neagerness of gamblers, unrestrained in their expressions of delight\r\nor disappointment as they thought they were winning or losing, and\r\ncommenting on the moves with all the assurance of connoisseurship;\r\nsometimes they squabbled angrily and then suddenly dropped their\r\nvoices, as the master of the coffee-shop had once or twice cautioned\r\nthem to be quiet.\r\n\r\nThe dwellings of boys such us these are among the worst in London, as\r\nregards ventilation, comfort, or cleanliness. They reside in the courts\r\nand recesses about Whitechapel and Petticoat-lane, and generally in a\r\ngarret. If not orphans they usually dwell with their father. I am told\r\nthat the care of a mother is almost indispensable to a poor Jew boy,\r\nand having that care he seldom becomes an outcast. The Jewesses and Jew\r\ngirls are rarely itinerant street-sellers--not in the proportion of one\r\nto twelve, compared with the men and boys; in this respect therefore\r\nthe street Jews differ widely from the English costermongers and the\r\nstreet Irish, nor are the Hebrew females even stall-keepers in the same\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nOne Jew boy’s lodging which I visited was in a back garret, low and\r\nsmall. The boy lived with his father (a street-seller of fruit), and\r\nthe room was very bare. A few sacks were thrown over an old palliass,\r\na blanket seemed to be used for a quilt; there were no fire-irons nor\r\nfender; no cooking utensils. Beside the bed was an old chest, serving\r\nfor a chair, while a board resting on a trestle did duty for a table\r\n(this was once, I presume, a small street-stall). The one not very\r\nlarge window was thick with dirt and patched all over. Altogether I\r\nhave seldom seen a more wretched apartment. The man, I was told, was\r\naddicted to drinking.\r\n\r\nThe callings of which the Jew boys have the monopoly are not connected\r\nwith the sale of any especial article, but rather with such things as\r\npresent a variety from those ordinarily offered in the streets, such\r\nas cakes, sweetmeats, fried fish, and (in the winter) elder wine.\r\nThe cakes known as “boolers”--a mixture of egg, flour, and candied\r\norange or lemon peel, cut very thin, and with a slight colouring from\r\nsaffron or something similar--are now sold principally, and used to be\r\nsold exclusively, by the Jew boys. Almond cakes (little round cakes\r\nof crushed almonds) are at present vended by the Jew boys, and their\r\nsponge biscuits are in demand. All these dainties are bought by the\r\nstreet-lads of the Jew pastry-cooks. The difference in these cakes,\r\nin their sweetmeats, and their elder wine, is that there is a dash\r\nof spice about them not ordinarily met with. It is the same with the\r\nfried fish, a little spice or pepper being blended with the oil. In\r\nthe street-sale of pickles the Jews have also the monopoly; these,\r\nhowever, are seldom hawked, but generally sold from windows and\r\ndoor-steads. The pickles are cucumbers or gherkins, and onions--a large\r\ncucumber being 2_d._, and the smaller 1_d._ and 1/2_d._\r\n\r\nThe faults of the Jew lad are an eagerness to make money by any means,\r\nso that he often grows up a cheat, a trickster, a receiver of stolen\r\ngoods, though seldom a thief, for he leaves that to others. He is\r\ncontent to profit by the thief’s work, but seldom _steals_ himself,\r\nhowever he may cheat. Some of these lads become rich men; others are\r\nvagabonds all their lives. None of the Jew lads confine themselves to\r\nthe sale of any one article, nor do they seem to prefer one branch of\r\nstreet-traffic to another. Even those who cannot read are exceedingly\r\nquick.\r\n\r\nI may here observe in connection with the receipt of stolen goods,\r\nthat I shall deal with this subject in my account of the LONDON\r\nTHIEVES. I shall also show the connection of Jewesses and Jews with the\r\n_prostitution of the metropolis_, in my forthcoming exposition of the\r\nLONDON PROSTITUTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET JEWESSES AND STREET JEW-GIRLS.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that the Jewesses and the young Jew girls, compared\r\nwith the adult Jews and Jew boys, are not street-traders in anything\r\nlike the proportion which the females were found to bear to the males\r\namong the Irish street-folk and the English costermongers. There are,\r\nhowever, a few Jewish females who are itinerant street-sellers as\r\nwell as stall keepers, in the proportion, perhaps, of one female to\r\nseven or eight males. The majority of the street Jew-girls whom I saw\r\non a round were accompanied by boys who were represented to be their\r\nbrothers, and I have little doubt such was the facts, for these young\r\nJewesses, although often pert and ignorant, are not unchaste. Of this\r\nI was assured by a medical gentleman who could speak with sufficient\r\npositiveness on the subject.\r\n\r\nFruit is generally sold by these boys and girls together, the lad\r\ndriving the barrow, and the girl inviting custom and handing the\r\npurchases to the buyers. In tending a little stall or a basket at a\r\nregular pitch, with such things as cherries or strawberries, the little\r\nJewess differs only from her street-selling sisters in being a brisker\r\ntrader. The stalls, with a few old knives or scissors, or odds and ends\r\nof laces, that are tended by the Jew girls in the streets in the Jewish\r\nquarters (I am told there are not above a dozen of them) are generally\r\nnear the shops and within sight of their parents or friends. One little\r\nJewess, with whom I had some conversation, had not even heard the\r\nname of the Chief Rabbi, the Rev. Dr. Adler, and knew nothing of any\r\ndistinction between German and Portuguese Jews; she had, I am inclined\r\nto believe, never heard of either. I am told that the whole, or nearly\r\nthe whole, of these young female traders reside with parents or\r\nfriends, and that there is among them far less than the average number\r\nof runaways. One Jew told me he thought that the young female members\r\nof his tribe did not tramp with the juveniles of the other sex--no,\r\nnot in the proportion of one to a hundred in comparison, he said with\r\na laugh, with “young women of the Christian persuasion.” My informant\r\nhad means of knowing this fact, as although still a young man, he had\r\ntraversed the greater part of England hawking perfumery, which he had\r\nabandoned as a bad trade. A wire-worker, long familiar with tramping\r\nand going into the country--a man upon whose word I have every reason\r\nto rely--told me that he could not remember a single instance of his\r\nhaving seen a young Jewess “travelling” with a boy.\r\n\r\nThere are a few adult Jewesses who are itinerant traders, but very\r\nfew. I met with one who carried on her arm a not very large basket,\r\nfilled with glass wares; chiefly salt-cellars, cigar-ash plates, blue\r\nglass dessert plates, vinegar-cruets, and such like. The greater part\r\nof her wares appeared to be blue, and she carried nothing but glass.\r\nShe was a good-looking and neatly-dressed woman. She peeped in at\r\neach shop-door, and up at the windows of every private house, in the\r\nstreet in which I met her, crying, “Clo’, old clo’!” She bartered her\r\nglass for old clothes, or bought the garments, dealing principally in\r\nfemale attire, and almost entirely with women. She declined to say\r\nanything about her family or her circumstances, except that she had\r\nnothing that way to complain about, but--when I had used some names I\r\nhad authority to make mention of--she said she would, with pleasure,\r\ntell me all about her trade, which she carried on rather than do\r\nnothing. “When I hawk,” she said with an English accent, her face being\r\nunmistakeably Jewish, “I hawk only good glass, and it can hardly be\r\ncalled hawking, as I swop it for more than I sell it. I always ask for\r\nthe mistress, and if she wants any of my glass we come to a bargain if\r\nwe can. O, it’s ridiculous to see what things some ladies--I suppose\r\nthey must be called ladies--offer for my glass. Children’s green or\r\nblue gauze veils, torn or faded, and not worth picking up, because no\r\nuse whatever; old ribbons, not worth dyeing, and old frocks, not worth\r\nwashing. People say, ‘as keen as a Jew,’ but ladies can’t think we’re\r\nvery keen when they offer us such rubbish. I do most at the middle kind\r\nof houses, both shops and private. I sometimes give a little money for\r\nsuch a thing as a shawl, or a fur tippet, as well as my glass--but only\r\nwhen I can’t help it--to secure a bargain. Sometimes, but not often,\r\nI get the old thing and a trifle for my glass. Occasionally I buy\r\noutright. I don’t do much, there’s so many in the line, and I don’t go\r\nout regularly. I can’t say how many women are in my way--very few; O, I\r\ndo middling. I told you I had no complaints to make. I don’t calculate\r\nmy profits or what I sell. My family do that and I don’t trouble\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SYNAGOGUES AND THE RELIGION OF THE STREET AND OTHER JEWS.\r\n\r\nThe Jews in this country are classed as “Portuguese” and “German.”\r\nAmong them are no distinctions of tribes, but there is of rites and\r\nceremonies, as is set forth in the following extract (which shows\r\nalso the mode of government) from a Jewish writer: “The Spanish and\r\nPortuguese Congregation of Jews, who are also called Sephardin (from\r\nthe word Sepharad, which signifies Spain in Hebrew), are distinct from\r\nthe German and Polish Jews in their ritual service. The prayers both\r\ndaily and for the Sabbath materially differ from each other, and the\r\nfestival prayers differ still more. Hence the Portuguese Jews have a\r\ndistinct prayer-book, and the German Jews likewise.\r\n\r\n“The fundamental laws are equally observed by both sects, but in\r\nthe ceremonial worship there exists numerous differences. The\r\nPortuguese Jews eat some food during the Passover, which the German\r\nJews are prohibited doing by _some_ Rabbis, but their authority\r\nis not acknowledged by the Portuguese Rabbis. Nor are the present\r\necclesiastical authorities in London of the two sects the same. The\r\nPortuguese Jews have their own Rabbis, and the German have their own.\r\nThe German Jews are much more numerous than the Portuguese; the chief\r\nRabbi of the German Jews is the Rev. Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler, late\r\nChief Rabbi of Hanover, who wears no beard, and dresses in the German\r\ncostume. The presiding Rabbi of the Portuguese Jews is the Rev. David\r\nMeldola, a native of Leghorn; his father filled the same office in\r\nLondon. Each chief Rabbi is supported by three other Rabbis, called\r\nDayamin, which signifies in Hebrew ‘Judges.’ Every Monday and Thursday\r\nthe Chief Rabbi of the German Jews, Dr. Adler, supported by his\r\nthree colleagues, sits for two hours in the Rabbinical College (Beth\r\nHamedrash), Smith’s-buildings, Leadenhall-street, to attend to all\r\napplications from the German Jews, which may be brought before him, and\r\nwhich are decided according to the Jewish law. Many disputes between\r\nJews in religious matters are settled in this manner; and if the Lord\r\nMayor or any other magistrate is told that the matter has already been\r\nsettled by the Jewish Rabbi he seldom interferes. This applies only\r\nto civil and not to criminal cases. The Portuguese Jews have their\r\nown hospital and their own schools. Both congregations have their\r\nrepresentatives in the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which board\r\nis acknowledged by government, and is triennial. Sir Moses Montefiore,\r\na Jew of great wealth, who distinguished himself by his mission to\r\nDamascus, during the persecution of the Jews in that place, and also by\r\nhis mission to Russia, some years ago, is the President of the Board.\r\nAll political matters, calling for communications with government, are\r\nwithin the province of that useful board.”\r\n\r\nThe Jews have eight synagogues in London, besides some smaller\r\nplaces which may perhaps, adopting the language of another church,\r\nbe called synagogues of ease. The great synagogue in Duke’s-place\r\n(a locality of which I have often had to speak) is the largest, but\r\nthe new synagogue, St. Helen’s, Bishopgate, is the one which most\r\nbetokens the wealth of the worshippers. It is rich with ornaments,\r\nmarble, and painted glass; the pavement is of painted marble, and\r\npresents a perfect round, while the ceiling is a half dome. There\r\nare besides these the Hamburg Synagogue, in Fenchurch-street;\r\nthe Portuguese Synagogue, in Bevis-marks; two smaller places, in\r\nCutler-street and Gun-yard, Houndsditch, known as Polish Synagogues;\r\nthe Maiden-lane (Covent-garden), Synagogue; the Western Synagogue, St.\r\nAlban’s-place, Pall-mall; and the West London Synagogue of British\r\nJews, Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. The last-mentioned is the\r\nmost aristocratic of the synagogues. The service there is curtailed,\r\nthe ritual abbreviated, and the days of observance of the Jewish\r\nfestival reduced from two to one. This alteration is strongly protested\r\nagainst by the other Jews, and the practices of this synagogue seem\r\nto show a yielding to the exactions or requirements of the wealthy.\r\nIn the old days, and in almost every country in Europe, it was held\r\nto be sinful even for a king--reverenced and privileged as such a\r\npotentate then was--to prosecute any undertaking before he heard mass.\r\nIn some states it was said in reproach of a noble or a sovereign, “he\r\nbreakfasts before he hears mass,” and, to meet the impatience of the\r\nGreat, “hunting masses,” as they were styled, or epitomes of the full\r\nservice, were introduced. The Jews, some eight or nine years back in\r\nthis country, seem to have followed this example; such was the case, at\r\nleast, as regards London and the wealthier of the professors of this\r\nancient faith.\r\n\r\nThe synagogues are not well attended, the congregations being smaller\r\nin proportion to the population than those of the Church of England.\r\nNeither, during the observance of the Jewish worship, is there any\r\nespecial manifestation of the service being regarded as of a sacred\r\nand divinely-ordained character. There is a buzzing talk among the\r\nattendants during the ceremony, and an absence of seriousness and\r\nattention. Some of the Jews, however, show the greatest devotion, and\r\nthe same may be said of the Jewesses, who sit apart in the synagogues,\r\nand are not required to attend so regularly as the men.\r\n\r\nI should not have alluded to this absence of the solemnities of\r\ndevotion, as regards the congregations of the Hebrews, had I not heard\r\nit regretted by Hebrews themselves. “It is shocking,” one said. Another\r\nremarked, “To attend the synagogue is looked upon too much as a matter\r\nof _business_; but perhaps there is the same spirit in some of the\r\nChristian churches.”\r\n\r\nAs to the street-Jews, religion is little known among them, or little\r\ncared for. They are indifferent to it--not to such a degree, indeed,\r\nas the costermongers, for they are not so ignorant a class--but yet\r\ncontrasting strongly in their neglect with the religious intensity of\r\nthe majority of the Roman Catholic Irish of the streets. In common\r\njustice I must give the remark of a Hebrew merchant with whom I had\r\nsome conversation on the subject:--“I can’t say much about street-Jews,\r\nfor my engagements lead me away from them, and I don’t know much about\r\nstreet-Christians. But if out of a hundred Jews you find that only ten\r\nof them care for their religion, how many out of a hundred Christians\r\nof any sort will care about theirs? Will ten of them care? If you\r\nanswer, but they are only nominal Christians, my reply is, the Jews are\r\nonly nominal Jews--Jews by birth, and not by faith.”\r\n\r\nAmong the Jews I conversed with--and of course only the more\r\nintelligent understood, or were at all interested in, the question--I\r\nheard the most contemptuous denunciation of all converts from Judaism.\r\nOne learned informant, who was by no means blind to the short-comings\r\nof his own people, expressed his conviction that no Jew had ever been\r\nreally _converted_. He had abandoned his faith from interested motives.\r\nOn this subject I am not called upon to express any opinion, and merely\r\nmention it to show a prevalent feeling among the class I am describing.\r\n\r\nThe street-Jews, including the majority of the more prosperous and most\r\nnumerous class among them, the old-clothes men, are far from being\r\nreligious in feeling, or well versed in their faith, and are, perhaps,\r\nin that respect on a level with the mass of the members of the Church\r\nof England; I say of the Church of England, because of that church the\r\nmany who do not profess religion are usually accounted members.\r\n\r\nIn the Rabbinical College, I may add, is the finest Jewish library\r\nin the world. It has been collected for several generations under\r\nthe care of the Chief Rabbis. The public are admitted, having first\r\nobtained tickets, given gratuitously, at the Chief Rabbi’s residence in\r\nCrosby-square.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE POLITICS, LITERATURE, AND AMUSEMENTS OF THE JEWS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no people in the world, possessing the average amount\r\nof intelligence in busy communities, who care so little for politics\r\nas the general body of the Jews. The wealthy classes may take an\r\ninterest in the matter, but I am assured, and by those who know their\r\ncountrymen well, that even with them such a quality as patriotism is a\r\nmere word. This may be accounted for in a great measure, perhaps, from\r\nan hereditary feeling. The Jew could hardly be expected to love a land,\r\nor to strive for the promotion of its general welfare, where he felt\r\nhe was but a sojourner, and where he was at the best but tolerated and\r\noften proscribed. But this feeling becomes highly reprehensible when it\r\nextends--as I am assured it does among many of the rich Jews--to their\r\nown people, for whom, apart from conventionalities, say my informants,\r\n_they care nothing whatever_; for so long as they are undisturbed in\r\nmoney-getting at home, their brethren may be persecuted all over the\r\nworld, while the rich Jew merely shrugs his shoulders. An honourable\r\nexception, however, exists in Sir Moses Montefiore, who has honourably\r\ndistinguished himself in the relief of his persecuted brethren on more\r\nthan one occasion. The great of the earth no longer spit upon the\r\ngabardine of the Jewish millionaire, nor do they draw his teeth to\r\nget his money, but the great Jew capitalists, with powerful influence\r\nin many a government, do not seek to direct that influence for the\r\nbettering of the lot of their poorer brethren, who, at the same time,\r\nbrook the restrictions and indignities which they have to suffer with\r\na perfect philosophy. In fact, the Jews have often been the props of\r\nthe courts who have persecuted them; that is to say, two or three\r\nJewish firms occasionally have not hesitated to lend millions to the\r\ngovernments by whom they and their people have been systematically\r\ndegraded and oppressed.\r\n\r\nI was told by a Hebrew gentleman (a professional man) that so little\r\ndid the Jews themselves care for “Jewish emancipation,” that he\r\nquestioned if one man in ten, actuated solely by his own feelings,\r\nwould trouble himself to walk the length of the street in which he\r\nlived to secure Baron Rothschild’s admission into the House of Commons.\r\nThis apathy, my informant urged with perfect truth, in nowise affected\r\nthe merits of the question, though he was convinced it formed a great\r\nobstacle to Baron Rothschild’s success; “for governments,” he said,\r\n“won’t give boons to people who don’t care for them; and, though this\r\nis called a boon, I look upon it as only a _right_.”\r\n\r\nWhen such is the feeling of the comparatively wealthier Jews, no one\r\ncan wonder that I found among the Jewish street-sellers and old-clothes\r\nmen with whom I talked on the subject--and their more influential\r\nbrethren gave me every facility to prosecute my inquiry among them--a\r\nperfect indifference to, and nearly as perfect an ignorance of,\r\npolitics. Perhaps no men buy so few newspapers, and read them so\r\nlittle, as the Jews generally. The street-traders, when I alluded to\r\nthe subject, said they read little but the “Police Reports.”\r\n\r\nAmong the body of the Jews there is little love of Literature.\r\nThey read far less (let it be remembered I have acquired all this\r\ninformation from Jews themselves, and from men who could not be\r\nmistaken in the matter), and are far less familiar with English\r\nauthorship, either historical or literary, than are the poorer English\r\nartizans. Neither do the wealthiest classes of the Jews care to\r\nfoster literature among their own people. One author, a short time\r\nago, failing to interest the English Jews, to promote the publication\r\nof his work, went to the United States, and his book was issued in\r\nPhiladelphia, the city of Quakers!\r\n\r\nThe Amusements of the Jews--and here I speak more especially of the\r\nstreet or open-air traders--are the theatres and concert-rooms. The\r\nCity of London Theatre, the Standard Theatre, and other playhouses at\r\nthe East-end of London, are greatly resorted to by the Jews, and more\r\nespecially by the younger members of the body, who sometimes constitute\r\na rather obstreperous gallery. The cheap concerts which they patronize\r\nare generally of a superior order, for the Jews are fond of music, and\r\namong them have been many eminent composers and performers, so that the\r\ntrash and jingle which delights the costermonger class would not please\r\nthe street Jew boys; hence their concerts are superior to the general\r\nrun of cheap concerts, and are almost always “got up” by their own\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nSussex-hall, in Leadenhall-street, is chiefly supported by Israelites;\r\nthere the “Jews’ and General Literary and Scientific Institution” is\r\nestablished, with reading-rooms and a library; and there lectures,\r\nconcerts, &c., are given as at similar institutions. Of late, on every\r\nFriday evening, Sussex-hall has been thrown open to the general public,\r\nwithout any charge for admission, and lectures have been delivered\r\ngratuitously, on literature, science, art, and general subjects, which\r\nhave attracted crowded audiences. The lecturers are chiefly Jews, but\r\nthe lectures are neither theological nor sectarian. The lecturers\r\nare Mr. M. H. Bresslau, the Rev. B. H. Ascher, Mr. J. L. Levison (of\r\nBrighton), and Mr. Clarke, a merchant in the City, a Christian, whose\r\nlectures are very popular among the Jews. The behaviour of the Jew\r\nattendants, and the others, the Jews being the majority, is decorous.\r\nThey seem “to like to receive information,” I was told; and a gentleman\r\nconnected with the hall argued that this attention showed a readiness\r\nfor proper instruction, when given in an attractive form, which\r\nfavoured the opinion that the young Jews, when not thrown in childhood\r\ninto the vortex of money-making, were very easily teachable, while\r\ntheir natural quickness made them both ready and willing to be taught.\r\n\r\nMy old-clothes buying informant mentioned a Jewish eating-house. I\r\nvisited one in the Jew quarter, but saw nothing to distinguish it from\r\nChristian resorts of the same character and cheapness (the “plate” of\r\ngood hot meat costing 4_d._, and vegetables 1_d._), except that it was\r\nfuller of Jews than of Christians, by three to two, perhaps, and that\r\nthere was no “pork” in the waiter’s specification of the fare.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CHARITIES, SCHOOLS, AND EDUCATION OF THE JEWS.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish charities are highly honourable to the body, for they allow\r\nnone of their people to live or die in a parish workhouse. It is true\r\nthat among the Jews in London there are many individuals of immense\r\nwealth; but there are also many rich Christians who care not one jot\r\nfor the need of their brethren. It must be borne in mind also, that not\r\nonly do the Jews voluntarily support their own poor and institutions,\r\nbut they contribute--compulsorily it is true--their quota to the\r\nsupport of the English poor and church; and, indeed, pay their due\r\nproportion of all the parliamentary or local imposts. This is the more\r\nhonourable and the more remarkable among the Jews, when we recollect\r\ntheir indisputable greed of money.\r\n\r\nIf a Jew be worn out in his old age, and unable to maintain himself,\r\nhe is either supported by the contributions of his friends, or out of\r\nsome local or general fund, or provided for in some asylum, and all\r\nthis seems to be done with a less than ordinary fuss and display, so\r\nthat the recipient of the charity feels himself more a pensioner than\r\na pauper.\r\n\r\nThe Jews’ Hospital, in the Mile-end Road, is an extensive building,\r\ninto which feeble old men and destitute children of both sexes are\r\nadmitted. Here the boys are taught trades, and the girls qualified\r\nfor respectable domestic service. The Widows’ Home, in Duke-street,\r\nAldgate, is for poor Hebrew widows. The Orphan Asylum, built at the\r\ncost of Mr. A. L. Moses, and supported by subscription, now contains\r\n14 girls and 8 boys; a school is attached to the asylum, which is\r\nin the Tenter Ground, Goodman’s-fields. The Hand-in-Hand Asylum,\r\nfor decayed old people, men and women, is in Duke’s-place, Aldgate.\r\nThere are likewise alms-houses for the Jews, erected also by Mr. A.\r\nL. Moses, at Mile-end, and other alms-houses, erected by Mr. Joel\r\nEmanuel, in Wellclose-square, near the Tower. There are, further, three\r\ninstitutions for granting marriage dowers to fatherless children;\r\nan institution in Bevis-marks, for the burial of the poor of the\r\ncongregation; “Beth Holim;” a house for the reception of the sick\r\npoor, and of poor lying-in women belonging to the congregation of the\r\nSpanish and Portuguese Jews; “Magasim Zobim,” for lending money to aid\r\napprenticeships among boys, to fit girls for good domestic service,\r\nand for helping poor children to proceed to foreign parts, when it is\r\nbelieved that the change will be advantageous to them; and “Noten Lebem\r\nLarcebim;” to distribute bread to the poor of the congregation on the\r\nday preceding the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nI am assured that these institutions are well-managed, and that, if\r\nthe charities are abused by being dispensed to undeserving objects, it\r\nis usually with the knowledge of the managers, who often let the abuse\r\npass, as a smaller evil than driving a man to theft or subjecting him\r\nto the chance of starvation. One gentleman, familiar with most of these\r\nestablishments, said to me with a laugh, “I believe, if you have had\r\nany conversation with the gentlemen who manage these matters, you will\r\nhave concluded that they are not the people to be imposed upon very\r\neasily.”\r\n\r\nThere are seven Jewish schools in London, four in the city, and three\r\nat the West-end, all supported by voluntary contributions. The Jews’\r\nFree School, in Bell-lane, Spitalfields, is the largest, and is\r\nadapted for the education of no fewer than 1200 boys and girls. The\r\nlate Baroness de Rothschild provided clothing, yearly, for all the\r\npupils in the school. In the Infant School, Houndsditch, are about 400\r\nlittle scholars. There are also the Orphan Asylum School, previously\r\nmentioned; the Western Jewish schools, for girls, in Dean-street, and,\r\nfor boys, in Greek-street, Soho, but considered as one establishment;\r\nand the West Metropolitan School, for girls, in Little Queen-street,\r\nand, for boys, in High Holborn, also considered as one establishment.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these means of education, the body of the poorer, or\r\nwhat in other callings might be termed the working-classes, are not\r\neven tolerably well educated; they are indifferent to the matter.\r\nWith many, the multiplication table seems to constitute what they\r\nthink the acme of all knowledge needful to a man. The great majority\r\nof the Jew boys, in the street, cannot read. A smaller portion can\r\nread, but so imperfectly that their ability to read detracts nothing\r\nfrom their ignorance. So neglectful or so necessitous (but I heard the\r\nignorance attributed to neglect far more frequently than necessity)\r\nare the poorer Jews, and so soon do they take their children away from\r\nschool, “to learn and do something for themselves,” and so irregular\r\nis their attendance, on the plea that the time cannot be spared, and\r\nthe boy must do something for himself, that many children leave the\r\nfree-schools not only about as ignorant as when they entered them, but\r\nalmost with an incentive to continued ignorance; for they knew nothing\r\nof reading, except that to acquire its rudiments is a pain, a labour,\r\nand a restraint. On some of the Jew boys the vagrant spirit is strong;\r\nthey _will_ be itinerants, if not wanderers,--though this is a spirit\r\nin no way confined to the Jew boys.\r\n\r\nAlthough the wealthier Jews may be induced to give money towards the\r\nsupport of their poor, I heard strong strictures passed upon them\r\nconcerning their indifference towards their brethren in all other\r\nrespects. Even if they subscribed to a school, they never cared whether\r\nor not it was attended, and that, much as was done, far more was in\r\nthe power of so wealthy and distinct a people. “This is all the more\r\ninexcusable,” was said to me by a Jew, “because there are so many rich\r\nJews in London, and if they exerted and exercised a broader liberality,\r\nas they might in instituting Jewish colleges, for instance, to promote\r\nknowledge among the middle-classes, and if they cared more about\r\nemploying their own people, their liberality would be far more fully\r\nfelt than similar conduct in a Christian, because they have a smaller\r\nsphere to influence. As to employing their own people, there are\r\nnumbers of the rich Jews who will employ any stranger in preference,\r\nif he work a penny a week cheaper. This sort of _clan_ employment,”\r\ncontinued my Jew informant, “should never be exclusive, but there\r\nmight, I think, be a judicious preference.”\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to set forth an account of the sums yearly\r\nsubscribed for purposes of education and charity by the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe Jews’ Free School in Spitalfields is supported by voluntary\r\ncontributions to the amount of about 1200_l._ yearly. To this sum a few\r\nChristians contribute, as to some other Hebrew institutions (which I\r\nshall specify), while Jews often are liberal supporters of Christian\r\npublic charities--indeed, some of the wealthier Jews are looked upon\r\nby the members of their own faith as inclined to act more generously\r\nwhere Christian charities, with the prestige of high aristocratic\r\nand fashionable patronage, are in question, than towards their own\r\ninstitutions. To the Jews’ Free School the Court of Common Council of\r\nthe Corporation of London lately granted 100_l._, through the exertions\r\nof Mr. Benjamin S. Phillips, of Newgate-street, a member of the\r\ncourt. The Baroness Lionel de Rothschild (as I have formerly stated of\r\nthe late Baroness) supplies clothing for the scholars. The school is\r\nadapted for the reception of 1200 boys and girls in equal proportion;\r\nabout 900 is the average attendance.\r\n\r\nThe Jews’ Infant School in Houndsditch, with an average attendance\r\napproaching 400, is similarly supported at a cost of from 800_l._ to\r\n1000_l._ yearly.\r\n\r\nThe Orphan Asylum School, in Goodman’s-fields, receives a somewhat\r\nlarger support, but in the expenditure is the cost of an asylum (before\r\nmentioned, and containing 22 inmates). The funds are about 1500_l._\r\nyearly. Christians subscribe to this institution also--Mr. Frederick\r\nPeel, M.P., taking great interest in it. The attendance of pupils is\r\nfrom 300 to 400.\r\n\r\nIt might be tedious to enumerate the other schools, after having\r\ndescribed the principal; I will merely add, therefore, that the yearly\r\ncontributions to each are from 700_l._ to 1000_l._, and the pupils\r\ntaught in each from 200 to 400. Of these further schools there are four\r\nalready specified.\r\n\r\nThe Jews’ Hospital, at Mile End, is maintained at a yearly cost of\r\nabout 3000_l._, to which Christians contribute, but not to a twentieth\r\nof the amount collected. The persons benefited are worn-out old men,\r\nand destitute children, while the number of almspeople is from 150 to\r\n200 yearly.\r\n\r\nThe other two asylums, &c., which I have specified, are maintained at\r\na cost of about 800_l._ each, as a yearly average, and the Almshouses,\r\nthree in number, at about half that sum. The persons relieved by\r\nthese last-mentioned institutions number about 250, two-thirds, or\r\nthereabouts, being in the asylums.\r\n\r\nThe Loan Societies are three: the Jewish Ladies Visiting and Benevolent\r\nLoan Society; the Linusarian Loan Society (why called Linusarian a\r\nlearned Hebrew scholar could not inform me, although he had asked\r\nthe question of others); and the Magasim Zobim (the Good Deeds), a\r\nPortuguese Jews’ Loan Society.\r\n\r\nThe business of these three societies is conducted on the same\r\nprinciple. Money is lent on personal or any security approved by the\r\nmanagers, and no interest is charged to the borrower. The amount\r\nlent yearly is from 600_l._ to 700_l._ by each society, the whole\r\nbeing repaid and with sufficient punctuality; a few weeks’ “grace” is\r\noccasionally allowed in the event of illness or any unforeseen event.\r\nThe Loan Societies have not yet found it necessary to proceed against\r\nany of their debtors; my informant thought this forbearance extended\r\nover six years.\r\n\r\nThere is not among the Jewish street-traders, as among the\r\ncostermongers and others, a class forming part, or having once formed\r\npart of themselves, and living by usury and loan mongering, where\r\nthey have amassed a few pounds. Whatever may be thought of the Jews’\r\nusurious dealings as regards the general public, the poorer classes of\r\ntheir people are not subjected to the exactions of usury, with all its\r\nclogs to a struggling man’s well-doing. Sometimes the amount required\r\nby an old-clothes man, or other street-trader, is obtained by or for\r\nhim at one of these loan societies. Sometimes it is advanced by the\r\nusual buyer of the second-hand garments collected by the street-Jew. No\r\nsecurity in such cases is given beyond--strange as it may sound--the\r\npersonal honour of an old-clothes man! An experienced man told me, that\r\ntaking all the class of Jew street-sellers, who are a very fluctuating\r\nbody, with the exception of the old-clothes men, the sum thus advanced\r\nas stock-money to them might be seldom less in any one year than\r\n300_l._, and seldom more than 500_l._ There is a prevalent notion\r\nthat the poorer Jews, when seeking charity, are supplied with goods\r\nfor street-sale by their wealthy brethren, and never with money--this\r\nappears to be unfounded.\r\n\r\nNow to sum up the above items we find that the yearly cost of the\r\nJewish schools is about 7000_l._, supplying the means of instruction to\r\n3000 children (out of a population of 18,000 of all ages, one-half of\r\nwhom, perhaps, are under 20 years). The yearly outlay in the asylums,\r\n&c., is, it appears, 5800_l._ annually, benefiting or maintaining about\r\n420 individuals (at a cost of nearly 14_l._ per head). If we add no\r\nmore than 200_l._ yearly for the minor charities or institutions I\r\nhave previously alluded to, we find 14,000_l._ expended annually in\r\nthe public schools and charities of the Jews of London, independently\r\nof about 2000_l._, which is the amount of the loans to those requiring\r\ntemporary aid.\r\n\r\nWe have before seen that the number of Jews in London is estimated\r\nby the best informed at about 18,000; hence it would appear that\r\nthe charitable donations of the Jews of London amount on an average\r\nto a little less than 1_l._ per head. Let us compare this with the\r\nbenevolence of the Christians. At the same ratio the sum devoted to the\r\ncharities of England and Wales should be very nearly 16,000,000_l._,\r\nbut, according to the most liberal estimates, it does not reach half\r\nthat amount; the rent of the land and other fixed property, together\r\nwith the interest of the money left for charitable purposes in England\r\nand Wales, is 1,200,000_l._ If, however, we add to the voluntary\r\ncontributions the sum raised compulsorily by assessment in aid of\r\nthe poor (about 7,000,000_l._ per annum), the ratio of the English\r\nChristian’s contributions to his needy brethren throughout the country\r\nwill be very nearly the same as that of the Jew’s. Moreover, if we\r\nturn our attention to the benevolent bequests and donations of the\r\nChristians of London, we shall find that their munificence does not\r\nfall far short of that of the metropolitan Jews. The gross amounts of\r\nthe charitable contributions of London are given below, together with\r\nthe numbers of institutions; and it will thus be seen that the sum\r\ndevoted to such purposes amounts to no less than 1,764,733_l._, or\r\nupwards of a million and three-quarters sterling for a population of\r\nabout two millions!\r\n\r\n                                       Income        Income\r\n                                       derived       derived\r\n                                   from voluntary     from\r\n                                   contributions.   property.\r\n  12 General medical hospitals        £31,265       £111,641\r\n  50 Medical charities for special\r\n    purposes                           27,974         68,690\r\n  35 General dispensaries              11,470          2,954\r\n  12 Preservation of life and\r\n    public morals                       8,730          2,773\r\n  18 Reclaiming the fallen and\r\n    staying the progress of\r\n    crime                              16,299         13,737\r\n  14 Relief of general destitution\r\n    and distress                       20,646          3,234\r\n  12 Relief of specified distress      19,473         10,408\r\n  14 Aiding the resources of\r\n    the industrious                     4,677          2,569\r\n  11 For the blind, deaf, and\r\n    dumb                               11,965         22,797\r\n  103 Colleges, hospitals, and\r\n    other asylums for the aged          5,857         77,190\r\n  16 Charitable pension societies      15,790          3,199\r\n  74 Charitable and provident,\r\n    chiefly for specified classes      19,905         83,322\r\n  31 Asylums for orphans and\r\n    other necessitous children         55,466         25,549\r\n  10 Educational foundations           15,000         78,112\r\n  4 Charitable modern ditto             4,000          9,300\r\n  40 School societies, religious\r\n    books, church aiding, and\r\n    Christian visitings, &c.          159,853        158,336\r\n  35 Bible and missionary             494,494         63,058\r\n                                    ------------------------\r\n  491 Total                         1,022,864        741,869\r\n\r\nIn connection with the statistical part of this subject I may mention\r\nthat the Chief Rabbis each receive 1200_l._ a year; the Readers of the\r\nSynagogues, of whom there are twelve in London, from 300_l._ to 400_l._\r\na year each; the Secretaries of the Synagogues, of whom there are also\r\ntwelve, from 200_l._ to 300_l._ each; the twelve under Secretaries\r\nfrom 100_l._ to 150_l._; and six Dayanim 100_l._ a year each. These\r\nlast-mentioned officers are looked upon by many of the Jews, as the\r\n“poor curates” may be by the members of the Church of England--as being\r\nexceedingly under-paid. The functions of the Dayanim have been already\r\nmentioned, and, I may add, that they must have received expensive\r\nscholarly educations, as for about four hours daily they have to read\r\nthe Talmud in the places of worship.\r\n\r\nThe yearly payment of these sacerdotal officials, then, independent\r\nof other outlay, amounts to about 11,700_l._; this is raised from the\r\nprofits of the seats in the synagogues and voluntary contributions,\r\ndonations, subscriptions, bequests, &c., among the Jews.\r\n\r\nI have before spoken of a Board of Deputies, in connection with the\r\nJews, and now proceed to describe its constitution. It is not a\r\nparliament among the Jews, I am told nor a governing power, but what\r\nmay be called a directing or regulating body. It is authorized by\r\nthe body of Jews, and recognised by her Majesty’s Government, as an\r\nestablished corporation, with powers to treat and determine on matters\r\nof civil and political policy affecting the condition of the Hebrews in\r\nthis country, and interferes in no way with religious matters. It is\r\nneither a metropolitan nor a local nor a detached board, but, as far as\r\nthe Jews in England may be so described, a national board. This board\r\nis elected triennially. The electors are the “seat-holders” in the\r\nJewish synagogues; that is to say, they belong to the class of Jews who\r\npromote the support of the synagogues by renting seats, and so paying\r\ntowards the cost of those establishments.\r\n\r\nThere are in England, Ireland, and Scotland, about 1000 of these\r\nseat-holders exercising the franchise, or rather entitled to exercise\r\nit, but many of them are indifferent to the privilege, as is often\r\ntestified by the apathy shown on the days of election. Perhaps\r\nthree-fourths of the privileged number may vote. The services of the\r\nrepresentatives are gratuitous, and no qualification is required, but\r\nthe elected are usually the leading metropolitan Jews. The proportion\r\nof the electors voting is in the ratio of the deputies elected.\r\nLondon returns 12 deputies; Liverpool, 2; Manchester, 2; Birmingham,\r\n2; Edinburgh, Dublin, (the only places in either Scotland or Ireland\r\nreturning deputies), Dover, Portsmouth, Southampton, Plymouth,\r\nCanterbury, Norwich, Swansea, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and two other places\r\n(according to the number of seat-holders), each one deputy, thus making\r\nup the number to 30. On election days the attendance, as I have said,\r\nis often small, but fluctuating according to any cause of excitement,\r\nwhich, however, is but seldom.\r\n\r\nThe question which has of late been discussed by this Board, and\r\nwhich is now under consideration, and negotiation with the Education\r\nCommissioners of her Majesty’s Privy Council, is the obtaining a\r\ngrant of money in the same proportion as it has been granted to other\r\neducational establishments. Nothing has as yet been given to the Jewish\r\nschools, and the matter is still undetermined.\r\n\r\nWith religious or sacerdotal questions the Board of Deputies does not,\r\nor is not required to meddle; it leaves all such matters to the bodies\r\nor tribunals I have mentioned. Indeed the deputies concern themselves\r\nonly with what may be called the _public_ interests of the Jews,\r\nboth as a part of the community and as a distinct people. The Jewish\r\ninstitutions, however, are not an exception to the absence of unanimity\r\namong the professors of the same creeds, for the members of the Reform\r\nSynagogue in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square, are not recognised\r\nas entitled to vote, and do not vote, accordingly, in the election\r\nof the Jewish deputies. Indeed, the Reform members, whose synagogue\r\nwas established eight years ago, were formally excommunicated by a\r\ndeclaration of the late Chief Rabbi, but this seems now to be regarded\r\nas a mere matter of form, for the members have lately partaken of all\r\nthe rites to which orthodox Jews are entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE FUNERAL CEREMONIES, FASTS, AND CUSTOMS OF THE JEWS.\r\n\r\nThe funeral ceremonies of the Jews are among the things which tend to\r\npreserve the distinctness and peculiarity of this people. Sometimes,\r\nthough now rarely, the nearest relatives of the deceased wear sackcloth\r\n(a coarse crape), and throw ashes and dust on their hair, for the\r\nterm during which the corpse remains unburied, this term being the\r\nsame as among Christians. When the corpse is carried to the Jews’\r\nburial-ground for interment the coffin is frequently opened, and\r\nthe corpse addressed, in a Hebrew formula, by any relative, friend,\r\nor acquaintance who may be present. The words are to the following\r\npurport: “If I have done anything that might be offensive--pardon,\r\npardon, pardon.” After that the coffin is carried round the\r\nburial-ground in a circuit, children chanting the 90th Psalm in its\r\noriginal Hebrew, “a prayer of Moses, the man of God.” The passages\r\nwhich the air causes to be most emphatic are these verses:--\r\n\r\n“3. Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n“4. For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is\r\npast, and as a watch in the night.\r\n\r\n“5. Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in\r\nthe morning they are like grass which groweth up.\r\n\r\n“6. In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is\r\ncut down, and withereth.\r\n\r\n“10. The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by\r\nreason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength\r\nlabour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.”\r\n\r\nThe coffin is then carried into a tent, and the funeral prayers,\r\nin Hebrew, are read. When it has been lowered into the grave, the\r\nrelatives, and indeed all the attendants at the interment, fill up\r\nthe grave, shovelling in the earth. In the Jews’ burial-ground are no\r\ndistinctions, no vaults or provisions for aristocratic sepulture. The\r\nvery rich and the very poor, the outcast woman and the virtuous and\r\nprosperous gentlewoman, “grossly familiar, side by side consume.” A\r\nJewish funeral is a matter of high solemnity.\r\n\r\nThe burial fees are 12_s._ for children, and from 2_l._ to 3_l._ for\r\nadults. These fees are not the property of the parties officiating, but\r\nform a portion of the synagogue funds for general purposes, payment of\r\nofficers, &c. No fees are charged to the relatives of poor Jews.\r\n\r\nTwo fasts are rigidly observed by the Jews, and even by those Jews who\r\nare usually indifferent to the observances of their religion. These are\r\nthe Black Fast, in commemoration of the destruction of Jerusalem, and\r\nthe White Fast, in commemoration of the atonement. On each of those\r\noccasions the Jews abstain altogether from food for 24 hours, or from\r\nsunset to sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE JEW STREET-SELLERS OF ACCORDIONS, AND OF THEIR STREET MUSICAL\r\nPURSUITS.\r\n\r\nI conclude my account of the Street-Jews with an account of the\r\naccordion sellers.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Jews, as a people, are musical, they are little concerned\r\nat present either in the sale of musical instruments in the streets,\r\nor in street-music or singing. Until within a few years, however, the\r\nstreet-sale of accordions was carried on by itinerant Jews, and had\r\npreviously been carried on most extensively in the country, even in the\r\nfar north of England. Some years back well-dressed Jews “travelled”\r\nwith stocks of accordions. In many country towns and in gentlemen’s\r\ncountry mansions, in taverns, and schools also, these accordions were\r\nthen a novelty. The Jew could play on the instrument, and carried a\r\nbook of instructions, which usually formed part of the bargain, and by\r\nthe aid of which, he made out, any one, even without previous knowledge\r\nof the practical art of music, could easily teach himself--nothing\r\nbut a little practice in fingering being wanted to make a good\r\naccordion-player. At first the accordions sold by the Jew hawkers were\r\ngood, two guineas being no unusual price to be paid for one, even to a\r\nstreet-seller, while ten and twenty shillings were the lower charges.\r\nBut the accordions were in a few years “made slop,” cheap instruments\r\nbeing sent to this country from Germany, and sold at less than half\r\ntheir former price, until the charge fell as low as 3_s._ 6_d._ or even\r\n2_s._ 6_d._--but only for “rubbish,” I was told. When the fragility\r\nand inferior musical qualities of these instruments came to be known,\r\nit was found almost impossible to sell in the streets even superior\r\ninstruments, however reasonable in price, and thus the trade sunk to a\r\nnonentity. So little demand is there now for these instruments that no\r\npawnbroker, I am assured, will advance money on one, however well made.\r\n\r\nThe itinerant accordion trade was always much greater in the country\r\nthan in London, for in town, I was told, few would be troubled to try,\r\nor even listen, to the tones of an accordion played by a street-seller,\r\nat their own doors, or in their houses. While there were 100 or 120\r\nJews hawking accordions in the country, there would not be 20 in\r\nLondon, including even the suburbs, where the sale was the best.\r\n\r\nCalculating that, when the trade was at its best, 130 Jews hawked\r\naccordions in town and country, and that each sold three a week, at\r\nan average price of 20_s._ each, or six in a week at an average price\r\nof 10_s._ each, the profit being from 50 to 100 per cent., we find\r\nupwards of 20,000_l._ expended in the course of the year in accordions\r\nof which, however, little more than a sixth part, or about 3000_l._,\r\nwas expended in London. This was only when the trade had all the\r\nrecommendations of novelty, and in the following year perhaps not half\r\nthe amount was realized. One informant thought that the year 1828-9\r\nwas the best for the sale of these instruments, but he spoke only from\r\nmemory. At the present time I could not find or hear of one street-Jew\r\nselling accordions; I remember, however, having seen one within the\r\npresent year. Most of the Jews who travelled with them have emigrated.\r\n\r\nIt is very rarely indeed that, fond as the Jews are of music, any of\r\nthem are to be found in the bands of street-musicians, or of such\r\nstreet-performers as the Ethiopian serenaders. If there be any, I was\r\ntold, they were probably not pure Jews, but of Christian parentage\r\non one side or the other, and not associating with their own people.\r\nAt the cheap concert-rooms, however, Jews are frequently singers,\r\nbut rarely the Jewesses, while some of the twopenny concerts at the\r\nEast-end are got up and mainly patronized by the poorer class of Jews.\r\nJews are also to be found occasionally among the supernumeraries of\r\nthe theatres; but, when not professionally engaged, these still live\r\namong their own people. I asked one young Jew who occasionally sang\r\nat a cheap concert-room, what description of songs they usually sung,\r\nand he answered “all kinds.” He, it seems, sang comic songs, but his\r\nfriend Barney, who had just left him, sang sentimental songs. He earned\r\n1_s._ and sometimes 2_s._, but more frequently 1_s._, three or four\r\nnights in the week, as he had no regular engagement. In the daytime he\r\nworked at cigar-making, but did not like it, it was “_so confining_.”\r\nHe had likewise sung, but gratuitously, at concerts got up for the\r\nbenefit of any person “bad off.” He knew nothing of the science and\r\nart of music. Of the superior class of Jew vocalists and composers, it\r\nis not of course necessary here to speak, as they do not come within\r\nthe scope of my present subject. Of Hebrew youths thus employed in\r\ncheap and desultory concert-singing, there are in the winter season, I\r\nam told, from 100 to 150, few, if any, depending entirely upon their\r\nprofessional exertions, but being in circumstances similar to those of\r\nmy young informant.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-BUYERS OF HOGS’-WASH.\r\n\r\nThe trade in hogs’-wash, or in the refuse of the table, is by no means\r\ninsignificant. The street-buyers are of the costermonger class, and\r\nsome of them have been costermongers, and “when not kept going regular\r\non wash,” I was told, are “costers still,” but with the advantage of\r\nhaving donkeys, ponies, or horses and carts, and frequently shops, as\r\nthe majority of the wash-buyers have; for they are often greengrocers\r\nas well as costermongers.\r\n\r\nThe hogs’ food obtained by these street-folk, or, as I most frequently\r\nheard it called, the “wash,” is procured from the eating-houses, the\r\ncoffee-houses which are also eating-houses (with “hot joints from 12\r\nto 4”), the hotels, the club-houses, the larger mansions, and the\r\npublic institutions. It is composed of the scum and lees of all broths\r\nand soups; of the washings of cooking utensils, and of the dishes and\r\nplates used at dinners and suppers; of small pieces of meat left on the\r\nplates of the diners in taverns, clubs, or cook-shops; of pieces of\r\npotato, or any remains of vegetables; of any viands, such as puddings,\r\nleft in the plates in the same manner; of gristle; of pieces of stale\r\nbread, or bread left at table; occasionally of meat kept, whether\r\ncooked or uncooked, until “blown,” and unfit for consumption (one man\r\ntold me that he had found whole legs of mutton in the wash he bought\r\nfrom a great eating-house, but very rarely): of potato-peelings; of\r\nold and bad potatoes; of “stock,” or the remains of meat stewed for\r\nsoup, which was not good enough for sale to be re-used by the poor; of\r\nparings of every kind of cheese or meat; and of the many things which\r\nare considered “only fit for pigs.”\r\n\r\nIt is not always, however, that the unconsumed food of great houses\r\nor of public bodies (where the dinners are a part of the institution)\r\ngoes to the wash-tub. At Buckingham-palace, I am told, it is given to\r\npoor people who have tickets for the receipt of it. At Lincoln’s-inn\r\nthe refuse or leavings of the bar dinners are sold to men who retail\r\nthem, usually small chandlers, and the poor people, who have the means,\r\nbuy this broken meat very readily at 4_d._, 6_d._, and 8_d._ the\r\npound, which is cheap for good cooked meat. Pie-crust, obtained by its\r\npurveyors in the same way, is sold, perhaps with a small portion of\r\nthe contents of the pie, in penny and twopenny-worths. A man familiar\r\nwith this trade told me that among the best customers for this kind of\r\nsecond-hand food were women of the town of the poorer class, who were\r\nalways ready, whenever they had a few pence at command, to buy what was\r\ntasty, cheap, and ready-cooked, because “they hadn’t no trouble with\r\nit, but only just to eat it.”\r\n\r\nOne of the principal sources of the “wash” supply is the cook-shops,\r\nor eating-houses, where the “leavings” on the plates are either the\r\nperquisites of the waiters or waitresses, or looked sharply after by\r\nmaster or mistress. There are also in these places the remains of\r\nsoups, and the potato-peelings, &c., of which I have spoken, together\r\nwith the keen appropriation to a profitable use of every crumb and\r\nscrap--when it is a portion of the gains of a servant, or when it adds\r\nto the receipts of the proprietor. In calculating the purchase-value of\r\nthe good-will of an eating-house, the “wash” is as carefully considered\r\nas is the number of daily guests.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal street-buyers from the eating-houses, and in\r\nseveral parts of town, is Jemmy Divine, of Lambeth. He is a pig-dealer,\r\nbut also sells his wash to others who keep pigs. He sends round a\r\ncart and horse under the care of a boy, or of a man, whom he may have\r\nemployed, or drives it himself, and he often has more carts than one.\r\nIn his cart are two or three tubs, well secured, so that they may not\r\nbe jostled out, into which the wash is deposited. He contracts by the\r\nweek, month, or quarter, with hotel-keepers and others, for their wash,\r\npaying from 10_l._ to as high as 50_l._ a year, about 20_l._ being an\r\naverage for well-frequented taverns and “dining-rooms.” The wash-tubs\r\non the premises of these buyers are often offensive, sometimes sending\r\nforth very sour smells.\r\n\r\nIn Sharp’s-alley, Smithfield, is another man buying quantities of\r\nwash, and buying fat and grease extensively. There is one also in\r\nPrince’s-street, Lambeth, who makes it his sole business to collect\r\nhogs’-wash; he was formerly a coal-heaver and wretchedly poor, but is\r\nnow able to make a decent livelihood in this trade, keeping a pony\r\nand cart. He generally keeps about 30 pigs, but also sells hogs’ food\r\nretail to any pig-keeper, the price being 4_d._ to 6_d._ a pail-full,\r\naccording to the quality, as the collectors are always anxious to\r\nhave the wash “rich,” and will not buy it if cabbage-leaves or the\r\nparings of green vegetables form a part of it. This man and the others\r\noften employ lads to go round for wash, paying them 2_s._ a week,\r\nand finding them in board. They are the same class of boys as those\r\nI have described as coster-boys, and are often strong young fellows.\r\nThese lads--or men hired for the purpose--are sometimes sent round\r\nto the smaller cook-shops and to private houses, where the wash is\r\ngiven to them for the trouble of carrying it away, in preference to\r\nits being thrown down the drain. Sometimes only 1_d._ a pail is paid\r\nby the street-buyer, provided the stuff be taken away punctually and\r\nregularly. These youths or men carry pails after the fashion of a\r\nmilkman.\r\n\r\nThe supply from the workhouses is very large. It is often that the\r\npaupers do not eat all the rice-pudding allowed, or all the bread,\r\nwhile soup is frequently left, and potatoes; and these leavings are\r\nworthless, except for pig-meat, as they would soon turn sour. It is the\r\nsame, though not to the same extent, in the prisons.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of some of the larger eating-houses relates also to\r\nthe club-houses.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of wash-buyers in the suburbs, who purchase, or\r\nobtain their stock gratuitously, at gentlemen’s houses, and retail it\r\neither to those who feed pigs as a business, or else to the many, I was\r\ntold, who live a little way out of town, and “like to grow their own\r\nbacon.” Many of these men perform the work themselves, without a horse\r\nand cart, and are on their feet every day and all day long, except on\r\nSundays, carrying hogs’-wash from the seller, or to the buyer. One man,\r\nwho had been in this trade at Woolwich, told me that he kept pigs at\r\none time, but ceased to do so, as his customers often murmured at the\r\nthin quality of the wash, declaring that he gave all the best to his\r\nown animals.\r\n\r\nIf it be estimated that there are 200 men daily buying hogs’-wash in\r\nLondon and the suburbs, within 15 miles, and that each collects only\r\n20 pails per day, paying 2_d._ per pail (thus allowing for what is\r\ncollected without purchase), we find 10,400_l._ expended annually in\r\nbuying hogs’-wash.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-BUYERS OF TEA-LEAVES.\r\n\r\nAn extensive trade, but less extensive, I am informed, than it was a\r\nfew years ago, is carried on in tea-leaves, or in the leaves of the\r\nherb after their having been subjected, in the usual way, to decoction.\r\nThese leaves are, so to speak, re-manufactured, in spite of great risk\r\nand frequent exposure, and in defiance of the law. The 17th Geo. III.,\r\nc. 29, is positive and stringent on the subject:--\r\n\r\n“Every person, whether a dealer in or seller of tea, or not, who shall\r\ndye or fabricate any sloe-leaves, liquorice-leaves _or the leaves of\r\ntea that have been used_, or the leaves of the ash, elder or other\r\ntree, shrub or plant, in imitation of tea, or who shall mix or colour\r\nsuch leaves with terra Japonica, copperas, sugar, molasses, clay,\r\nlogwood or other ingredient, or who shall sell or expose to sale, or\r\nhave in custody, any such adulterations in imitation of tea, shall for\r\nevery pound forfeit, on conviction, by the oath of one witness, before\r\none justice, 5_l._; or, on non-payment, be committed to the House of\r\nCorrection for not more than twelve or less than six months.”\r\n\r\nThe same act also authorizes a magistrate, on the oath of an excise\r\nofficer, or any one, by whom he suspects this illicit trade to be\r\ncarried on, to seize the herbs, or spurious teas, and the whole\r\napparatus that may be found on the premises, the herbs to be burnt and\r\nthe other articles sold, the proceeds of such a sale, after the payment\r\nof expenses, going half to the informer and half to the poor of the\r\nparish.\r\n\r\nIt appears evident, from the words of this act which I have\r\n_italicised_, that the use of tea-leaves for the robbery of the public\r\nand the defrauding of the revenue has been long in practice. The\r\nextract also shows what other cheats were formerly resorted to--the\r\nsubstitutes most popular with the tea-manufacturers at one time being\r\nsloe-leaves. If, however, one-tenth of the statements touching the\r\napplications of the leaves of the sloe-tree, and of the juice of its\r\nsour, astringent fruit, during the war-time, had any foundation in\r\ntruth, the sloe must have been regarded commercially as one of the most\r\nvaluable of our native productions, supplying our ladies with their\r\ntea, and our gentlemen with their port-wine.\r\n\r\nWomen and men, three-fourths of the number being women, go about\r\nbuying tea-leaves of the female servants in the larger, and of the\r\nshopkeepers’ wives in the smaller, houses. But the great purveyors\r\nof these things are the charwomen. In the houses where they char the\r\ntea-leaves are often reserved for them to be thrown on the carpets when\r\nswept, as a means of allaying the dust, or else they form a part of\r\ntheir perquisites, and are often asked for if not offered. The mistress\r\nof a coffee-shop told me that her charwoman, employed in cleaning every\r\nother morning, had the tea-leaves as a part of her remuneration, or\r\nas a matter of course. What the charwoman did with them her employer\r\nnever inquired, although she was always anxious to obtain them, and\r\nshe referred me to the poor woman in question. I found her in a very\r\nclean apartment on the second floor of a decent house in Somers-town; a\r\nstrong hale woman, with what may be called an industrious look. She was\r\nmiddle-aged, and a widow, with one daughter, then a nursemaid in the\r\nneighbourhood, and had regular employment.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, “I get the tea-leaves whenever I can, and the most\r\nat two coffee-shops that I work at, but neither of them have so many\r\nas they used to have. I think it’s because cocoa’s come so much to be\r\nasked for in them, and so they sell less tea. I buy tea-leaves only\r\nat one place. It’s a very large family, and I give the servant 4_d._\r\nand sometimes 3_d._ or 2_d._ a fortnight for them, but I’m nothing in\r\npocket, for the young girl is a bit of a relation of mine, and it’s\r\nlike a trifle of pocket-money for her. She gives a penny every time\r\nshe goes to her chapel, and so do I; there’s a box for it fixed near\r\nthe door. O yes, her mistress knows I buy them, for her mistress knew\r\nme before she was married, and that’s about 15 or 16 years since.\r\nWhen I’ve got this basin (producing it) full I sell it, generally\r\nfor 4_d._ I don’t know what the leaves in it will weigh, and I have\r\nnever sold them by weight, but I believe some have. Perhaps they might\r\nweigh, as damp as some of them are, about a pound. I sell them to a\r\nchandler now. I have sold them to a rag-and-bottle-shop. I’ve had men\r\nand women call upon me and offer to buy them, but not lately, and I\r\nnever liked the looks of them, and never sold them any. I don’t know\r\nwhat they’re wanted for, but I’ve heard that they’re mixed with new\r\ntea. I have nothing to do with that. I get them honestly and sell them\r\nhonestly, and that’s all I can say about it. Every little helps, and if\r\nrich people won’t pay poor people properly, then poor people can’t be\r\nexpected to be very nice. But I don’t complain, and that’s all I know\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\nThe chandler in question knew nothing of the trade in tea-leaves, he\r\nsaid; he bought none, and he did not know that any of the shopkeepers\r\ndid, and he could not form a notion what they could be wanted for, if\r\nit wasn’t to sweep carpets!\r\n\r\nThis mode of buying or collecting is, I am told the commonest mode of\r\nany, and it certainly presents some peculiarities. The leaves which are\r\nto form the spurious tea are collected, in great measure, by a class\r\nwho are perhaps more likely than any other to have themselves to buy\r\nand drink the stuff which they have helped to produce! By charwomen and\r\nwasher-women a “nice cup of tea” in the afternoon during their work is\r\ngenerally classed among the comforts of existence, yet they are the\r\nvery persons who sell the tea-leaves which are to make their “much\r\nprized beverage.” It is curious to reflect also, that as tea-leaves\r\nare used indiscriminately for being re-made into what is considered\r\nnew tea, what must be the strength of our tea in a few years. Now all\r\nhousewives complain that twice the quantity of tea is required to make\r\nthe infusion of the same strength as formerly, and if the collection\r\nof old tea-leaves continues, and the refuse leaves are to be dried and\r\nre-dried perpetually, surely we must get to use pounds where we now do\r\nounces.\r\n\r\nA man formerly in the tea-leaf business, and very anxious not to be\r\nknown--but upon whose information, I am assured from a respectable\r\nsource, full reliance may be placed--gave me the following account:--\r\n\r\n“My father kept a little shop in the general line, and I helped him; so\r\nI was partly brought up to the small way. But I was adrift by myself\r\nwhen I was quite young--18 or so perhaps. I can read and write well\r\nenough, but I was rather of too gay a turn to be steady. Besides,\r\nfather was very poor at times, and could seldom pay me anything, if\r\nI worked ever so. He was very fond of his belly too, and I’ve known\r\nhim, when he’s had a bit of luck, or a run of business, go and stuff\r\nhisself with fat roast pork at a cook-shop till he could hardly waddle,\r\nand then come home and lock hisself upstairs in his bed-room and sleep\r\nthree parts of the afternoon. (My mother was dead.) But father was a\r\nkind-hearted man for all that, and for all his roast pork, was as thin\r\nas a whipping-post. I kept myself when I left him, just off and on\r\nlike, by collecting grease, and all that; it can’t be done so easy now,\r\nI fancy; so I got into the tea-leaf business, but father had nothing to\r\ndo with it. An elderly sort of a woman who I met with in my collecting,\r\nand who seemed to take a sort of fancy to me, put me up to the leaves.\r\nShe was an out-and-out hand at anything that way herself. Then I bought\r\ntea-leaves with other things, for I suppose for four or five years. How\r\nlong ago is it? O, never mind, sir, a few years. I bought them at many\r\nsorts of houses, and carried a box of needles, and odds and ends, as a\r\nsort of introduction. There wasn’t much of that wanted though, for I\r\ncalled, when I could, soon in the mornings before the family was up,\r\nand some ladies don’t get up till 10 or 11 you know. The masters wasn’t\r\nmuch; it was the mistresses I cared about, because they are often such\r\nTartars to the maids and always a-poking in the way.\r\n\r\n“I’ve tried to do business in the great lords’ houses in the squares\r\nand about the parks, but there was mostly somebody about there to\r\nhinder you. Besides, the servants in such places are often on board\r\nwages, and often, when they’re not on board wages, find their own tea\r\nand sugar, and little of the tea-leaves is saved when every one has a\r\nseparate pot of tea; so there’s no good to be done there. Large houses\r\nin trade where a number of young men is boarded, drapers or grocers, is\r\namong the best places, as there is often a housekeeper there to deal\r\nwith, and no mistress to bother. I always bought by the lot. If you\r\noffered to weigh you would not be able to clear anything, as they’d be\r\nsure to give the leaves a extra wetting. I put handfulls of the leaves\r\nto my nose, and could tell from the smell whether they were hard drawn\r\nor not. When they isn’t hard drawn they answer best, and them I put to\r\none side. I had a bag like a lawyer’s blue bag, with three divisions in\r\nit, to put my leaves into, and so keep them ’sunder. Yes, I’ve bought\r\nof charwomen, but somehow I think they did’nt much admire selling to\r\nme. I hardly know how I made them out, but one told me of another. They\r\nlike the shops better for their leaves, I think; because they can get\r\na bit of cheese, or snuff, or candles for them there; though I don’t\r\nknow much about the shop-work in this line. I’ve often been tried to\r\nbe took in by the servants. I’ve found leaves in the lot offered to\r\nme to buy what was all dusty, and had been used for sweeping; and if\r\nI’d sold them with my stock they’d have been stopped out of the next\r\nmoney. I’ve had tea-leaves given me by servants oft enough, for I used\r\nto sweetheart them a bit, just to get over them; and they’ve laughed,\r\nand asked me whatever I could want with them. As for price, why, I\r\njudged what a lot was worth, and gave accordingly--from 1_d._ to 1_s._\r\nI never gave more than 1_s._ for any one lot at a time, and that had\r\nbeen put to one side for me in a large concern, for about a fortnight I\r\nsuppose. I can’t say how many people had been tea’d on them. If it was\r\na housekeeper, or anybody that way, that I bought of, there was never\r\nanything said about what they was wanted for. What _did_ I want them\r\nfor? Why, to sell again; and though him as I sold them to never said\r\nso, I knew they was to dry over again. I know nothing about who he was,\r\nor where he lived. The woman I told you of sent him to me. I suppose I\r\ncleared about 10_s._ a week on them, and did a little in other things\r\nbeside; perhaps I cleared rather more than 10_s._ on leaves some weeks,\r\nand 5_s._ at others. The party as called upon me once a week to buy my\r\nleaves was a very polite man, and seemed quite the gentleman. There was\r\nno weighing. He examined the lot, and said ‘so much.’ He wouldn’t stand\r\n’bating, or be kept haggling; and his money was down, and no nonsense.\r\nWhat cost me 5_s._ I very likely got three half-crowns for. It was no\r\ngreat trade, if you consider the trouble. I’ve sometimes carried the\r\nleaves that he’d packed in papers, and put into a carpet-bag, where\r\nthere was others, to a coffee-shop; they always had ‘till called for’\r\nmarked on a card then. I asked no questions, but just left them.\r\nThere was two, and sometimes four boys, as used to bring me leaves on\r\nSaturday nights. I think they was charwomen’s sons, but I don’t know\r\nfor a positive, and I don’t know how they made me out. I think I was\r\none of the tip-tops of the trade at one time; some weeks I’ve laid out\r\na sov. (sovereign) in leaves. I haven’t a notion how many’s in the\r\nline, or what’s doing now; but much the same I’ve no doubt. I’m glad\r\n_I’ve_ done with it.”\r\n\r\nI am told by those who are as well-informed on the subject as is\r\nperhaps possible, when a surreptitious and dishonest traffic is the\r\nsubject of inquiry, that although less spurious tea is sold, there are\r\nmore makers of it. Two of the principal manufacturers have of late,\r\nhowever, been prevented carrying on the business by the intervention\r\nof the excise officers. The spurious tea-men are also the buyers of\r\n“wrecked tea,” that is, of tea which has been part of the salvage\r\nof a wrecked vessel, and is damaged or spoiled entirely by the salt\r\nwater. This is re-dried and dyed, so as to appear fresh and new. It is\r\ndyed with Prussian blue, which gives it what an extensive tea-dealer\r\ndescribed to me as an “intensely fine green.” It is then mixed with\r\nthe commonest Gunpowder teas and with the strongest Young Hysons, and\r\nhas always a kind of “metallic” smell, somewhat like that of a copper\r\nvessel after friction in its cleaning. These teas are usually sold at\r\n4_s._ the pound.\r\n\r\nSloe-leaves for spurious tea, as I have before stated, were in\r\nextensive use, but this manufacture ceased to exist about 20 years ago.\r\nNow the spurious material consists only of the old tea-leaves, at least\r\nso far as experienced tradesmen know. The adulteration is, however,\r\nI am assured, more skilfully conducted than it used to be, and its\r\nstaple is of far easier procuration. The law, though it makes the use\r\nof old tea-leaves, as components of what is called tea, punishable,\r\nis nevertheless silent as to their sale or purchase; they can be\r\ncollected, therefore, with a comparative impunity.\r\n\r\nThe tea-leaves are dried, dyed (or re-dyed), and shrivelled on plates\r\nof hot metal, carefully tended. The dyes used are those I have\r\nmentioned. These teas, when mixed, are hawked in the country, but not\r\nin town, and are sold to the hawkers at 7 lbs. for 21_s._ The quarters\r\nof pounds are retailed at 1_s._ A tea-dealer told me that he could\r\nrecognise this adulterated commodity, but it was only a person skilled\r\nin teas who could do so, by its _coarse_ look. For green tea--the\r\nmixture to which the prepared leaves are mostly devoted--the old tea is\r\nblended with the commonest Gunpowders and Hysons. No dye, I am told, is\r\nrequired when black tea is thus re-made; but I know that plumbago is\r\noften used to simulate the bloom. The inferior shopkeepers sell this\r\nadulterated tea, especially in neighbourhoods where the poor Irish\r\ncongregate, or any of the lowest class of the poor English.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the statistics of a trade which exists in spite not only\r\nof the vigilance of the excise and police officers but of public\r\nreprobation, and which is essentially a secret trade, is not possible.\r\nI heard some, who were likely to be well-informed, conjecture--for it\r\ncannot honestly be called more than a conjecture--that between 500 and\r\n1000 lbs., perhaps 700 lbs., of old tea-leaves were made up weekly\r\nin London; but of this he thought that about an eighth was spoilt by\r\nburning in the process of drying.\r\n\r\nAnother gentleman, however, thought that, at the very least, double the\r\nabove quantity of old tea-leaves was weekly manufactured into new tea.\r\nAccording to his estimate, and he was no mean authority, no less than\r\n1500 lbs. weekly, or 78,000 lbs. per annum of this trash are yearly\r\npoured into the London market. The average consumption of tea is about\r\n1-1/4 lb. per annum for each man, woman, or child in the kingdom;\r\ncoffee being the _principal_ unfermented beverage of the poor. Those,\r\nhowever, of the poorest who drink tea consume about two ounces per week\r\n(half an ounce serving them twice), or one pound in the course of every\r\ntwo months. This makes the annual consumption of the adult tea-drinking\r\npoor amount to 6 lbs., and it is upon this class the spurious tea is\r\nchiefly foisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-FINDERS OR COLLECTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese men, for by far the great majority are men, may be divided,\r\naccording to the nature of their occupations, into three classes:--\r\n\r\n1. The bone-grubbers and rag-gatherers, who are, indeed, the same\r\nindividuals, the pure-finders, and the cigar-end and old wood\r\ncollectors.\r\n\r\n2. The dredgermen, the mud-larks, and the sewer-hunters.\r\n\r\n3. The dustmen and nightmen, the sweeps and the scavengers.\r\n\r\nThe first class go abroad daily to _find_ in the streets, and carry\r\naway with them such things as bones, rags, “pure” (or dogs’-dung),\r\nwhich no one appropriates. These they sell, and on that sale support\r\na wretched life. The second class of people are also as strictly\r\n_finders_; but their industry, or rather their labour, is confined to\r\nthe river, or to that subterranean city of sewerage unto which the\r\nThames supplies the great outlets. These persons may not be immediately\r\nconnected with the _streets_ of London, but their pursuits are carried\r\non in the open air (if the sewer-air may be so included), and are all,\r\nat any rate, out-of-door avocations. The third class is distinct from\r\neither of these, as the labourers comprised in it are not finders, but\r\n_collectors_ or _removers_ of the dirt and filth of our streets and\r\nhouses, and of the soot of our chimneys.\r\n\r\nThe two first classes also differ from the third in the fact that the\r\nsweeps, dustmen, scavengers, &c., are paid (and often large sums) for\r\nthe removal of the refuse they collect; whereas the bone-grubbers, and\r\nmud-larks, and pure-finders, and dredgermen, and sewer-hunters, get for\r\ntheir pains only the value of the articles they gather.\r\n\r\nHerein, too, lies a broad distinction between the street-finder, or\r\ncollector, and the street-buyer: though both deal principally with\r\nrefuse, the buyer _pays_ for what he is permitted to take away; whereas\r\nthe finder or collector is either paid (like the sweep), or else he\r\nneither pays nor is paid (like the bone-grubber), for the refuse that\r\nhe removes.\r\n\r\nThe third class of street-collectors also presents another and a\r\nmarkedly distinctive characteristic. They act in the capacity of\r\nservants, and do not depend upon chance for the result of their day’s\r\nlabour, but are put to stated tasks, being employed and paid a fixed\r\nsum for their work. To this description, however, some of the sweeps\r\npresent an exception; as when the sweep works on his own account, or,\r\nas it is worded, “is his own master.”\r\n\r\nThe public health requires the periodical cleaning of the streets, and\r\nthe removal of the refuse matter from our dwellings; and the man who\r\ncontracts to carry on this work is decidedly a street-collector; for\r\non what he collects or removes depends the amount of his remuneration.\r\nThus a wealthy contractor for the public scavengery, is as entirely one\r\nof the street-folk as the unskilled and ignorant labourer he employs.\r\nThe master lives, and, in many instances, has become rich, on the\r\nresults of his street employment; for, of course, the actual workmen\r\nare but as the agents or sources of his profit. Even the collection of\r\n“pure” (dogs’-dung) in the streets, if conducted by the servants of any\r\ntanner or leather dresser, either for the purposes of his own trade or\r\nfor sale to others, might be the occupation of a wealthy man, deriving\r\na small profit from the labour of each particular collector. The same\r\nmay also be said of bone-grubbing, or any similar occupation, however\r\ninsignificant, and now abandoned to the outcast.\r\n\r\nWere the collection of mud and dust carried on by a number of distinct\r\nindividuals--that is to say, were each individual dustman and scavenger\r\nto collect on his own account, there is no doubt that no _one man_\r\ncould amass a fortune by such means--while if the collection of bones\r\nand rags and even dogs’-dung were carried on “in the large way,” that\r\nis to say, by a number of individual collectors working for one “head\r\nman,” even the picking up of the most abject refuse of the metropolis\r\nmight become the source of great riches.\r\n\r\nThe bone-grubber and the mud-lark (the searcher for refuse on the\r\nbanks of the river) differ little in their pursuits or in their\r\ncharacteristics, excepting that the mud-larks are generally boys, which\r\nis more an accidental than a definite distinction. The grubbers are\r\nwith a few exceptions stupid, unconscious of their degradation, and\r\nwith little anxiety to be relieved from it. They are usually taciturn,\r\nbut this taciturn habit is common to men whose callings, if they\r\ncannot be called solitary, are pursued with little communication with\r\nothers. I was informed by a man who once kept a little beer-shop near\r\nFriar-street, Southwark Bridge-road (where then and still, he thought,\r\nwas a bone-grinding establishment), that the bone-grubbers who carried\r\ntheir sacks of bones thither sometimes had a pint of beer at his house\r\nwhen they had received their money. They usually sat, he told me,\r\nsilently looking at the corners of the floor--for they rarely lifted\r\ntheir eyes up--as if they were expecting to see some bones or refuse\r\nthere available for their bags. Of this inertion, perhaps fatigue and\r\ndespair may be a part. I asked some questions of a man of this class\r\nwhom I saw pick up in a road in the suburbs something that appeared to\r\nhave been a coarse canvas apron, although it was wet after a night’s\r\nrain and half covered with mud. I inquired of him what he thought\r\nabout when he trudged along looking on the ground on every side. His\r\nanswer was, “Of nothing, sir.” I believe that no better description\r\ncould be given of that vacuity of mind or mental inactivity which\r\nseems to form a part of the most degraded callings. The minds of such\r\nmen, even without an approach to idiotcy, appear to be a blank. One\r\ncharacteristic of these poor fellows, bone-grubbers and mud-larks, is\r\nthat they are very poor, although I am told some of them, the older\r\nmen, have among the poor the reputation of being misers. It is not\r\nunusual for the youths belonging to these callings to live with their\r\nparents and give them the amount of their earnings.\r\n\r\nThe sewer-hunters are again distinct, and a far more intelligent and\r\nadventurous class; but they work in gangs. They must be familiar with\r\nthe course of the tides, or they might be drowned at high water. They\r\nmust have quick eyes too, not merely to descry the objects of their\r\nsearch, but to mark the points and bearings of the subterraneous\r\nroads they traverse; in a word, “to know their way underground.”\r\nThere is, moreover, some spirit of daring in venturing into a dark,\r\nsolitary sewer, the chart being only in the memory, and in braving\r\nthe possibility of noxious vapours, and the by no means insignificant\r\ndangers of the rats infesting these places.\r\n\r\nThe dredgermen, the finders of the water, are again distinct, as being\r\nwatermen, and working in boats. In some foreign parts, in Naples, for\r\ninstance, men carrying on similar pursuits are also divers for anything\r\nlost in the bay or its confluent waters. One of these men, known some\r\nyears ago as “the Fish,” could remain (at least, so say those whom\r\nthere is no reason to doubt) three hours under the water without\r\nrising to the surface to take breath. He was, it is said, web-footed,\r\nnaturally, and partially web-fingered. The King of the Two Sicilies\r\nonce threw a silver cup into the sea for “the Fish” to bring up and\r\nretain as a reward, but the poor diver was never seen again. It was\r\nbelieved that he got entangled among the weeds on the rocks, and so\r\nperished. The dredgermen are necessarily well acquainted with the sets\r\nof the tide and the course of the currents in the Thames. Every one of\r\nthese men works on his own account, being as it were a “small master,”\r\nwhich, indeed, is one of the great attractions of open-air pursuits.\r\nThe dredgermen also depend for their maintenance upon the sale of what\r\nthey find, or the rewards they receive.\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise, however, as was before observed, with the third class\r\nof the street-finders, or rather collectors. In all the capacities of\r\ndustmen, nightmen, scavengers, and sweeps, the employers of the men are\r\n_paid_ to do the work, the proceeds of the street-collection forming\r\nonly a portion of the employer’s remuneration. The sweep has the soot\r\nin addition to his 6_d._ or 1_s._; the master scavenger has a payment\r\nfrom the parish funds to sweep the streets, though the clearance of\r\nthe cesspools, &c., in private houses, may be an individual bargain.\r\nThe whole refuse of the streets belongs to the contractor to make the\r\nbest of, but it must be cleared away, and so must the contents of a\r\ndust-bin; for if a mass of dirt become offensive, the householder may\r\nbe indicted for a nuisance, and municipal by-laws require its removal.\r\nIt is thus made a matter of compulsion that the dust be removed from\r\na private house; but it is otherwise with the soot. Why a man should\r\nbe permitted to let soot accumulate in his chimney--perhaps exposing\r\nhimself, his family, his lodgers, and his neighbours to the dangers of\r\nfire, it may not be easy to account for, especially when we bear in\r\nmind that the same man may not accumulate cabbage-leaves and fish-tails\r\nin his yard.\r\n\r\nThe dustmen are of the plodding class of labourers, mere labourers, who\r\nrequire only bodily power, and possess little or no mental development.\r\nMany of the agricultural labourers are of this order, and the dustman\r\noften seems to be the stolid ploughman, modified by a residence in a\r\ncity, and engaged in a peculiar calling. They are generally uninformed,\r\nand no few of them are dustmen because their fathers were. The same\r\nmay be said of nightmen and scavengers. At one time it was a popular,\r\nor rather a vulgar notion that many dustmen had become possessed of\r\nlarge sums, from the plate, coins, and valuables they found in clearing\r\nthe dust-bins--a manifest absurdity; but I was told by a marine-store\r\ndealer that he had known a young woman, a dustman’s daughter, sell\r\nsilver spoons to a neighbouring marine-store man, who was “not very\r\nparticular.”\r\n\r\nThe circumstances and character of the chimney-sweeps have, since\r\nParliament “put down” the climbing boys, undergone considerable change.\r\nThe sufferings of many of the climbing boys were very great. They\r\nwere often ill-lodged, ill-fed, barely-clad, forced to ascend hot and\r\nnarrow flues, and subject to diseases--such as the chimney-sweep’s\r\ncancer--peculiar to their calling. The child hated his trade, and was\r\neasily tempted to be a thief, for prison was an asylum; or he grew\r\nup a morose tyrannical fellow as journeyman or master. Some of the\r\nyoung sweeps became very bold thieves and house-breakers, and the most\r\nremarkable, as far as personal daring is concerned: the boldest feat of\r\nescape from Newgate was performed by a youth who had been brought up\r\na chimney-sweep. He climbed up the two bare rugged walls of a corner\r\nof the interior of the prison, in the open air, to the height of some\r\n60 feet. He had only the use of his hands, knees, and feet, and a\r\nsingle slip, from fear or pain, would have been death; he surmounted a\r\nparapet after this climbing, and gained the roof, but was recaptured\r\nbefore he could get clear away. He was, moreover, a sickly, and reputed\r\na cowardly, young man, and ended his career in this country by being\r\ntransported.\r\n\r\nA master sweep, now in middle age, and a man “well to do,” told me that\r\nwhen a mere child he had been apprenticed out of the workhouse to a\r\nsweep, such being at that time a common occurrence. He had undergone,\r\nhe said, great hardships while learning his business, and was long,\r\nfrom the indifferent character of his class, ashamed of being a sweep,\r\nboth as journeyman and master; but the sweeps were so much improved in\r\ncharacter now, that he no longer felt himself disgraced in his calling.\r\n\r\nThe sweeps are more intelligent than the mere ordinary labourers I have\r\nwritten of under this head, but they are, of course, far from being an\r\neducated body.\r\n\r\nThe further and more minute characteristics of the curious class of\r\nstreet-finders or collectors will be found in the particular details\r\nand statements.\r\n\r\nAmong the finders there is perhaps the greatest poverty existing,\r\nthey being the very lowest class of all the street-people. Many of\r\nthe very old live on the hard dirty crusts they pick up out of the\r\nroads in the course of their rounds, washing them and steeping them\r\nin water before they eat them. Probably that vacuity of mind which is\r\na distinguishing feature of the class is the mere atony or emaciation\r\nof the mental faculties proceeding from--though often producing in the\r\nwant of energy that it necessarily begets--the extreme wretchedness\r\nof the class. But even their liberty and a crust--as it frequently\r\nliterally is--appears preferable to these people to the restrictions of\r\nthe workhouse. Those who are unable to comprehend the inertia of both\r\nbody and mind begotten by the despair of long-continued misfortune are\r\nreferred to page 357 of the first volume of this work, where it will\r\nbe found that a tinman, in speaking of the misery connected with the\r\nearly part of his street-career, describes the effect of extreme want\r\nas producing not only an absence of all hope, but even of a desire to\r\nbetter the condition. Those, however, who have studied the mysterious\r\nconnection between body and mind, and observed what different creatures\r\nthey themselves are before and after dinner, can well understand that a\r\nlong-continued deficiency of food must have the same weakening effect\r\non the muscles of the mind and energy of the thoughts and will, as it\r\nhas on the limbs themselves.\r\n\r\nOccasionally it will be found that the utter abjectness of the\r\nbone-grubbers has arisen from the want of energy begotten by\r\nintemperate habits. The workman has nothing but this same energy\r\nto live upon, and the permanent effect of stimulating liquors is\r\nto produce an amount of depression corresponding to the excitement\r\nmomentarily caused by them in the frame. The operative, therefore,\r\nwho spends his earnings on “drink,” not only squanders them on a\r\nbrutalising luxury, but deprives himself of the power, and consequently\r\nof the disposition, to work for more, and hence that idleness,\r\ncarelessness, and neglect which are the distinctive qualities of the\r\ndrunkard, and sooner or later compass his ruin.\r\n\r\nFor the poor wretched children who are reared to this the lowest trade\r\nof all, surely even the most insensible and unimaginative must feel\r\nthe acutest pity. There is, however, this consolation: I have heard\r\nof none, with the exception of the more prosperous sewer-hunters and\r\ndredgermen, who have remained all their lives at street-finding. Still\r\nthere remains much to be done by all those who are impressed with a\r\nsense of the trust that has been confided to them, in the possession of\r\nthose endowments which render their lot in this world so much more easy\r\nthan that of the less lucky street-finders.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONE-GRUBBERS AND RAG-GATHERERS.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the bone-grubbers and rag-gatherers, the “pure,” or\r\ndogs’-dung collectors, and the cigar-end finders, are necessarily\r\nsimilar. All lead a wandering, unsettled sort of life, being compelled\r\nto be continually on foot, and to travel many miles every day in search\r\nof the articles in which they deal. They seldom have any fixed place of\r\nabode, and are mostly to be found at night in one or other of the low\r\nlodging-houses throughout London. The majority are, moreover, persons\r\nwho have been brought up to other employments, but who from some\r\nfailing or mishap have been reduced to such a state of distress that\r\nthey were obliged to take to their present occupation, and have never\r\nafter been able to get away from it.\r\n\r\nOf the whole class it is considered that there are from 800 to 1000\r\nresident in London, one-half of whom, at the least, sleep in the\r\ncheap lodging-houses. The Government returns estimate the number of\r\nmendicants’ lodging-houses in London to be upwards of 200. Allowing\r\ntwo bone-grubbers and pure-finders to frequent each of these\r\nlodging-houses, there will be upwards of 400 availing themselves of\r\nsuch nightly shelters. As many more, I am told, live in garrets and\r\nill-furnished rooms in the lowest neighbourhoods. There is no instance\r\non record of any of the class renting even the smallest house for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMoreover there are in London during the winter a number of persons\r\ncalled “trampers,” who employ themselves at that season in\r\nstreet-finding. These people are in the summer country labourers\r\nof some sort, but as soon as the harvest and potato-getting and\r\nhop-picking are over, and they can find nothing else to do in the\r\ncountry, they come back to London to avail themselves of the shelter\r\nof the night asylums or refuges for the destitute (usually called\r\n“straw-yards” by the poor), for if they remained in the provinces at\r\nthat period of the year they would be forced to have recourse to the\r\nunions, and as they can only stay one night in each place they would\r\nbe obliged to travel from ten to fifteen miles per day, to which in\r\nthe winter they have a strong objection. They come up to London in the\r\nwinter, not to look for any regular work or employment, but because\r\nthey know that they can have a nightly shelter, and bread night and\r\nmorning for nothing, during that season, and can during the day collect\r\nbones, rags, &c. As soon as the “straw-yards” close, which is generally\r\nabout the beginning of April, the “trampers” again start off to the\r\ncountry in small bands of two or three, and without any fixed residence\r\nkeep wandering about all the summer, sometimes begging their way\r\nthrough the villages and sleeping in the casual wards of the unions,\r\nand sometimes, when hard driven, working at hay-making or any other\r\nlight labour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BONE-GRUBBER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThose among the bone-grubbers who do not belong to the regular\r\n“trampers” have been either navvies, or men who have not been able\r\nto obtain employment at their own business, and have been driven to\r\nit by necessity as a means of obtaining a little bread for the time\r\nbeing, and without any intention of pursuing the calling regularly;\r\nbut, as I have said, when once in the business they cannot leave it,\r\nfor at least they make certain of getting a few halfpence by it, and\r\ntheir present necessity does not allow them time to look after other\r\nemployment. There are many of the street-finders who are old men and\r\nwomen, and many very young children who have no other means of living.\r\nSince the famine in Ireland vast numbers of that unfortunate people,\r\nparticularly boys and girls, have been engaged in gathering bones and\r\nrags in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe bone-picker and rag-gatherer may be known at once by the greasy\r\nbag which he carries on his back. Usually he has a stick in his hand,\r\nand this is armed with a spike or hook, for the purpose of more easily\r\nturning over the heaps of ashes or dirt that are thrown out of the\r\nhouses, and discovering whether they contain anything that is saleable\r\nat the rag-and-bottle or marine-store shop. The bone-grubber generally\r\nseeks out the narrow back streets, where dust and refuse are cast, or\r\nwhere any dust-bins are accessible. The articles for which he chiefly\r\nsearches are rags and bones--rags he prefers--but waste metal, such as\r\nbits of lead, pewter, copper, brass, or old iron, he prizes above all.\r\nWhatever he meets with that he knows to be in any way saleable he puts\r\ninto the bag at his back. He often finds large lumps of bread which\r\nhave been thrown out as waste by the servants, and occasionally the\r\nhousekeepers will give him some bones on which there is a little meat\r\nremaining; these constitute the morning meal of most of the class. One\r\nof my informants had a large rump of beef bone given to him a few days\r\nprevious to my seeing him, on which “there was not less than a pound of\r\nmeat.”\r\n\r\nThe bone-pickers and rag-gatherers are all early risers. They have\r\nall their separate beats or districts, and it is most important to\r\nthem that they should reach their district before any one else of\r\nthe same class can go over the ground. Some of the beats lie as far\r\nas Peckham, Clapham, Hammersmith, Hampstead, Bow, Stratford, and\r\nindeed all parts within about five miles of London. In summer time\r\nthey rise at two in the morning, and sometimes earlier. It is not\r\nquite light at this hour--but bones and rags can be discovered before\r\ndaybreak. The “grubbers” scour all quarters of London, but abound more\r\nparticularly in the suburbs. In the neighbourhood of Petticoat-lane\r\nand Ragfair, however, they are the most numerous on account of the\r\ngreater quantity of rags which the Jews have to throw out. It usually\r\ntakes the bone-picker from seven to nine hours to go over his rounds,\r\nduring which time he travels from 20 to 30 miles with a quarter to a\r\nhalf hundredweight on his back. In the summer he usually reaches home\r\nabout eleven of the day, and in the winter about one or two. On his\r\nreturn home he proceeds to sort the contents of his bag. He separates\r\nthe rags from the bones, and these again from the old metal (if he\r\nbe lucky enough to have found any). He divides the rags into various\r\nlots, according as they are white or coloured; and if he have picked up\r\nany pieces of canvas or sacking, he makes these also into a separate\r\nparcel. When he has finished the sorting he takes his several lots\r\nto the rag-shop or the marine-store dealer, and realizes upon them\r\nwhatever they may be worth. For the white rags he gets from 2_d._ to\r\n3_d._ per pound, according as they are clean or soiled. The white rags\r\nare very difficult to be found; they are mostly very dirty, and are\r\ntherefore sold with the coloured ones at the rate of about 5 lbs. for\r\n2_d._ The bones are usually sold with the coloured rags at one and\r\nthe same price. For fragments of canvas or sacking the grubber gets\r\nabout three-farthings a pound; and old brass, copper, and pewter about\r\n4_d._ (the marine-store keepers say 5_d._), and old iron one farthing\r\nper pound, or six pounds for 1_d._ The bone-grubber thinks he has\r\ndone an excellent day’s work if he can earn 8_d._; and some of them,\r\nespecially the very old and the very young, do not earn more than\r\nfrom 2_d._ to 3_d._ a day. To make 10_d._ a day, at the present price\r\nof rags and bones, a man must be remarkably active and strong,--“ay!\r\nand lucky, too,” adds my informant. The average amount of earnings, I\r\nam told, varies from about 6_d._ to 8_d._ per day, or from 3_s._ to\r\n4_s._ a week; and the highest amount that a man, the most brisk and\r\npersevering at the business, can by any possibility earn in one week is\r\nabout 5_s._, but this can only be accomplished by great good fortune\r\nand industry--the usual weekly gains are about half that sum. In bad\r\nweather the bone-grubber cannot do so well, because the rags are wet,\r\nand then they cannot sell them. The majority pick up bones only in wet\r\nweather; those who _do_ gather rags during or after rain are obliged to\r\nwash and dry them before they can sell them. The state of the shoes of\r\nthe rag and bone-picker is a very important matter to him; for if he\r\nbe well shod he can get quickly over the ground; but he is frequently\r\nlamed, and unable to make any progress from the blisters and gashes on\r\nhis feet, occasioned by the want of proper shoes.\r\n\r\nSometimes the bone-grubbers will pick up a stray sixpence or a shilling\r\nthat has been dropped in the street. “The handkerchief I have round\r\nmy neck,” said one whom I saw, “I picked up with 1_s._ in the corner.\r\nThe greatest prize I ever found was the brass cap of the nave of a\r\ncoach-wheel; and I _did_ once find a quarter of a pound of tobacco in\r\nSun-street, Bishopsgate. The best bit of luck of all that I ever had\r\nwas finding a cheque for 12_l._ 15_s._ lying in the gateway of the\r\nmourning-coach yard in Titchborne-street, Haymarket. I was going to\r\nlight my pipe with it, indeed I picked it up for that purpose, and\r\nthen saw it was a cheque. It was on the London and County Bank, 21,\r\nLombard-street. I took it there, and got 10_s._ for finding it. I went\r\nthere in my rags, as I am now, and the cashier stared a bit at me. The\r\ncheque was drawn by a Mr. Knibb, and payable to a Mr. Cox. I _did_\r\nthink I should have got the odd 15_s._ though.”\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the average amount of the earnings of the\r\nbone-pickers is 6_d._ per day, or 3_s._ per week, being 7_l._ 16_s._\r\nper annum for each person. It has also been shown that the number of\r\npersons engaged in the business may be estimated at about 800; hence\r\nthe earnings of the entire number will amount to the sum of 20_l._ per\r\nday, or 120_l._ per week, which gives 6240_l._ as the annual earnings\r\nof the bone-pickers and rag-gatherers of London. It may also be\r\ncomputed that each of the grubbers gathers on an average 20 lbs. weight\r\nof bone and rags; and reckoning the bones to constitute three-fourths\r\nof the entire weight, we thus find that the gross quantity of these\r\narticles gathered by the street-finders in the course of the year,\r\namounts to 3,744,000 lbs. of bones, and 1,240,000 lbs. of rags.\r\n\r\nBetween the London and St. Katherine’s Docks and Rosemary Lane, there\r\nis a large district inter-laced with narrow lanes, courts, and alleys\r\nramifying into each other in the most intricate and disorderly manner,\r\ninsomuch that it would be no easy matter for a stranger to work his\r\nway through the interminable confusion without the aid of a guide,\r\nresident in and well conversant with the locality. The houses are of\r\nthe poorest description, and seem as if they tumbled into their places\r\nat random. Foul channels, huge dust-heaps, and a variety of other\r\nunsightly objects, occupy every open space, and dabbling among these\r\nare crowds of ragged dirty children who grub and wallow, as if in their\r\nnative element. None reside in these places but the poorest and most\r\nwretched of the population, and, as might almost be expected, this,\r\nthe cheapest and filthiest locality of London, is the head-quarters of\r\nthe bone-grubbers and other street-finders. I have ascertained on the\r\nbest authority, that from the centre of this place, within a circle\r\nof a mile in diameter, there dwell not less than 200 persons of this\r\nclass. In this quarter I found a bone-grubber who gave me the following\r\naccount of himself:--\r\n\r\n“I was born in Liverpool, and when about 14 years of age, my father\r\ndied. He used to work about the Docks, and I used to run on errands for\r\nany person who wanted me. I managed to live by this after my father’s\r\ndeath for three or four years. I had a brother older than myself, who\r\nwent to France to work on the railroads, and when I was about 18 he\r\nsent for me, and got me to work with himself on the Paris and Rouen\r\nRailway, under McKenzie and Brassy, who had the contract. I worked on\r\nthe railroads in France for four years, till the disturbance broke\r\nout, and then we all got notice to leave the country. I lodged at that\r\ntime with a countryman, and had 12_l._, which I had saved out of my\r\nearnings. This sum I gave to my countryman to keep for me till we got\r\nto London, as I did not like to have it about me, for fear I’d lose it.\r\nThe French people paid our fare from Rouen to Havre by the railway,\r\nand there put us on board a steamer to Southampton. There was about 50\r\nof us altogether. When we got to Southampton, we all went before the\r\nmayor; we told him about how we had been driven out of France, and he\r\ngave us a shilling a piece; he sent some one with us, too, to get us\r\na lodging, and told us to come again the next day. In the morning the\r\nmayor gave every one who was able to walk half-a-crown, and for those\r\nwho were not able he paid their fare to London on the railroad. I had\r\na sore leg at the time, and I came up by the train, and when I gave\r\nup my ticket at the station, the gentleman gave me a shilling more. I\r\ncouldn’t find the man I had given my money to, because he had walked\r\nup; and I went before the Lord Mayor to ask his advice; he gave me\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ I looked for work everywhere, but could get nothing to do;\r\nand when the 2_s._ 6_d._ was all spent, I heard that the man who had\r\nmy money was on the London and York Railway in the country; however, I\r\ncouldn’t get that far for want of money then; so I went again before\r\nthe Lord Mayor, and he gave me two more, but told me not to trouble him\r\nany further. I told the Lord Mayor about the money, and then he sent an\r\nofficer with me, who put me into a carriage on the railway. When I got\r\ndown to where the man was at work, he wouldn’t give me a farthing; I\r\nhad given him the money without any witness bring present, and he said\r\nI could do nothing, because it was done in another country. I staid\r\ndown there more than a week trying to get work on the railroad, but\r\ncould not. I had no money and was nearly starved, when two or three\r\ntook pity on me, and made up four or five shillings for me, to take\r\nme back again to London. I tried all I could to get something to do,\r\ntill the money was nearly gone; and then I took to selling lucifers,\r\nand the fly-papers that they use in the shops, and little things like\r\nthat; but I could do no good at this work, there was too many at it\r\nbefore me, and they knew more about it than I did. At last, I got so\r\nbad off I didn’t know what to do; but seeing a great many about here\r\ngathering bones and rags, I thought I’d do so too--a poor fellow must\r\ndo something. I was advised to do so, and I have been at it ever since.\r\nI forgot to tell you that my brother died in France. We had good wages\r\nthere, four francs a day, or 3_s._ 4_d._ English; I don’t make more\r\nthan 3_d._ or 4_d._ and sometimes 6_d._ a day at bone-picking. I don’t\r\ngo out before daylight to gather anything, because the police takes\r\nmy bag and throws all I’ve gathered about the street to see if I have\r\nanything stolen in it. I never stole anything in all my life, indeed\r\nI’d do anything before I’d steal. Many a night I’ve slept under an arch\r\nof the railway when I hadn’t a penny to pay for my bed; but whenever\r\nthe police find me that way, they make me and the rest get up, and\r\ndrive us on, and tell us to keep moving. I don’t go out on wet days,\r\nthere’s no use in it, as the things won’t be bought. I can’t wash and\r\ndry them, because I’m in a lodging-house. There’s a great deal more\r\nthan a 100 bone-pickers about here, men, women, and children. The Jews\r\nin this lane and up in Petticoat-lane give a good deal of victuals\r\naway on the Saturday. They sometimes call one of us in from the street\r\nto light the fire for them, or take off the kettle, as they must not\r\ndo anything themselves on the Sabbath; and then they put some food on\r\nthe footpath, and throw rags and bones into the street for us, because\r\nthey must not hand anything to us. There are some about here who get a\r\ncouple of shillings’ worth of goods, and go on board the ships in the\r\nDocks, and exchange them for bones and bits of old canvas among the\r\nsailors; I’d buy and do so too if I only had the money, but can’t get\r\nit. The summer is the worst time for us, the winter is much better,\r\nfor there is more meat used in winter, and then there are more bones.”\r\n(Others say differently.) “I intend to go to the country this season,\r\nand try to get something to do at the hay-making and harvest. I make\r\nabout 2_s._ 6_d._ a week, and the way I manage is this: sometimes I\r\nget a piece of bread about 12 o’clock, and I make my breakfast of\r\nthat and cold water; very seldom I have any dinner,--unless I earn\r\n6_d._ I can’t get any,--and then I have a basin of nice soup, or a\r\npenn’orth of plum-pudding and a couple of baked ’tatoes. At night I\r\nget 1/4_d._ worth of coffee, 1/2_d._ worth of sugar, and 1-1/4_d._\r\nworth of bread, and then I have 2_d._ a night left for my lodging; I\r\nalways try to manage that, for I’d do anything sooner than stop out all\r\nnight. I’m always happy the day when I make 4_d._, for then I know I\r\nwon’t have to sleep in the street. The winter before last, there was a\r\nstraw-yard down in Black Jack’s-alley, where we used to go after six\r\no’clock in the evening, and get 1/2 lb. of bread, and another 1/2 lb.\r\nin the morning, and then we’d gather what we could in the daytime and\r\nbuy victuals with what we got for it. We were well off then, but the\r\nstraw-yard wasn’t open at all last winter. There used to be 300 of\r\nus in there of a night, a great many of the dock-labourers and their\r\nfamilies were there, for no work was to be got in the docks; so they\r\nweren’t able to pay rent, and were obliged to go in. I’ve lost my\r\nhealth since I took to bone-picking, through the wet and cold in the\r\nwinter, for I’ve scarcely any clothes, and the wet gets to my feet\r\nthrough the old shoes; this caused me last winter to be nine weeks in\r\nthe hospital of the Whitechapel workhouse.”\r\n\r\nThe narrator of this tale seemed so dejected and broken in spirit,\r\nthat it was with difficulty his story was elicited from him. He was\r\nevidently labouring under incipient consumption. I have every reason\r\nto believe that he made a truthful statement,--indeed, he did not\r\nappear to me to have sufficient intellect to invent a falsehood. It is\r\na curious fact, indeed, with reference to the London street-finders\r\ngenerally, that they seem to possess less rational power than any\r\nother class. They appear utterly incapable of trading even in the most\r\ntrifling commodities, probably from the fact that buying articles\r\nfor the purpose of selling them at a profit, requires an exercise\r\nof the mind to which they feel themselves incapable. Begging, too,\r\nrequires some ingenuity or tact, in order to move the sympathies of\r\nthe well-to-do, and the street-finders being incompetent for this,\r\nthey work on day after day as long as they are able to crawl about in\r\npursuit of their unprofitable calling. This cannot be fairly said of\r\nthe younger members of this class, who are sent into the streets by\r\ntheir parents, and many of whom are afterwards able to find some more\r\nreputable and more lucrative employment. As a body of people, however,\r\nyoung and old, they mostly exhibit the same stupid, half-witted\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nTo show how bone-grubbers occasionally manage to obtain shelter\r\nduring the night, the following incident may not be out of place. A\r\nfew mornings past I accidentally encountered one of this class in a\r\nnarrow back lane; his ragged coat--the colour of the rubbish among\r\nwhich he toiled--was greased over, probably with the fat of the bones\r\nhe gathered, and being mixed with the dust it seemed as if the man\r\nwere covered with bird-lime. His shoes--torn and tied on his feet with\r\npieces of cord--had doubtlessly been picked out of some dust-bin, while\r\nhis greasy bag and stick unmistakably announced his calling. Desirous\r\nof obtaining all the information possible on this subject, I asked him\r\na few questions, took his address, which he gave without hesitation,\r\nand bade him call on me in the evening. At the time appointed, however,\r\nhe did not appear; on the following day therefore I made way to the\r\naddress he had given, and on reaching the spot I was astonished to find\r\nthe house in which he had said he lived was uninhabited. A padlock was\r\non the door, the boards of which were parting with age. There was not\r\na whole pane of glass in any of the windows, and the frames of many of\r\nthem were shattered or demolished. Some persons in the neighbourhood,\r\nnoticing me eyeing the place, asked whom I wanted. On my telling the\r\nman’s name, which it appeared he had not dreamt of disguising, I\r\nwas informed that he had left the day before, saying he had met the\r\nlandlord in the morning (for such it turned out he had fancied me to\r\nbe), and that the gentleman had wanted him to come to his house, but\r\nhe was afraid to go lest he should be sent to prison for breaking into\r\nthe place. I found, on inspection, that the premises, though locked\r\nup, could be entered by the rear, one of the window-frames having been\r\nremoved, so that admission could be obtained through the aperture.\r\nAvailing myself of the same mode of ingress, I proceeded to examine\r\nthe premises. Nothing could well be more dismal or dreary than the\r\ninterior. The floors were rotting with damp and mildew, especially\r\nnear the windows, where the wet found easy entrance. The walls were\r\neven slimy and discoloured, and everything bore the appearance of\r\ndesolation. In one corner was strewn a bundle of dirty straw, which\r\ndoubtlessly had served the bone-grubber for a bed, while scattered\r\nabout the floor were pieces of bones, and small fragments of dirty\r\nrags, sufficient to indicate the calling of the late inmate. He had\r\nhad but little difficulty in removing his property, seeing that it\r\nconsisted solely of his bag and his stick.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph concerning the chiffoniers or rag-gatherers of\r\nParis appeared in the London journals a few weeks since:--\r\n\r\n“The fraternal association of rag-gatherers (chiffoniers) gave a\r\ngrand banquet on Saturday last (21st of June). It took place at\r\na public-house called the _Pot Tricolore_, near the _Barrière de\r\nFontainbleau_, which is frequented by the rag-gathering fraternity. In\r\nthis house there are three rooms, each of which is specially devoted\r\nto the use of different classes of rag-gatherers: one, the least\r\ndirty, is called the ‘Chamber of Peers,’ and is occupied by the first\r\nclass--that is, those who possess a basket in a good state, and a crook\r\nornamented with copper; the second, called the ‘Chamber of Deputies,’\r\nbelonging to the second class, is much less comfortable, and those\r\nwho attend it have baskets and crooks not of first-rate quality; the\r\nthird room is in a dilapidated condition, and is frequented by the\r\nlowest class of rag-gatherers who have no basket or crook, and who\r\nplace what they find in the streets in a piece of sackcloth. They call\r\nthemselves the ‘_Réunion des Vrais Prolétaires_.’ The name of each room\r\nis written in chalk above the door; and generally such strict etiquette\r\nis observed among the rag-gatherers that no one goes into the apartment\r\nnot occupied by his own class. At Saturday’s banquet, however, all\r\ndistinctions of rank were laid aside, and delegates of each class\r\nunited fraternally. The president was the oldest rag-gatherer in Paris;\r\nhis age is 88, and he is called ‘the Emperor.’ The banquet consisted\r\nof a sort of _olla podrida_, which the master of the establishment\r\npompously called _gibelotte_, though of what animal it was composed it\r\nwas impossible to say. It was served up in huge earthen dishes, and\r\nbefore it was allowed to be touched payment was demanded and obtained;\r\nthe other articles were also paid for as soon as they were brought in;\r\nand a deposit was exacted as a security for the plates, knives, and\r\nforks. The wine, or what did duty as such, was contained in an earthen\r\npot called the _Petit Père Noir_, and was filled from a gigantic vessel\r\nnamed _Le Moricaud_. The dinner was concluded by each guest taking a\r\nsmall glass of brandy. Business was then proceeded to. It consisted\r\nin the reading and adoption of the statutes of the association,\r\nfollowed by the drinking of numerous toasts to the president, to the\r\nprosperity of rag-gathering, to the union of rag-gatherers, &c. A\r\ncollection amounting to 6_f._ 75_c._ was raised for sick members of the\r\nfraternity. The guests then dispersed; but several of them remained at\r\nthe counter until they had consumed in brandy the amount deposited as\r\nsecurity for the crockery, knives, and forks.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “PURE”-FINDERS.\r\n\r\nDogs’-dung is called “Pure,” from its cleansing and purifying\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nThe name of “Pure-finders,” however, has been applied to the men\r\nengaged in collecting dogs’-dung from the public streets only, within\r\nthe last 20 or 30 years. Previous to this period there appears to\r\nhave been no men engaged in the business, old women alone gathered\r\nthe substance, and they were known by the name of “bunters,” which\r\nsignifies properly gatherers of rags; and thus plainly intimates that\r\nthe rag-gatherers originally added the collecting of “Pure” to their\r\noriginal and proper vocation. Hence it appears that the bone-grubbers,\r\nrag-gatherers, and pure-finders, constituted formerly but one\r\nclass of people, and even now they have, as I have stated, kindred\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nThe pure-finders meet with a ready market for all the dogs’-dung they\r\nare able to collect, at the numerous tanyards in Bermondsey, where\r\nthey sell it by the stable-bucket full, and get from 8_d._ to 10_d._\r\nper bucket, and sometimes 1_s._ and 1_s._ 2_d._ for it, according to\r\nits quality. The “dry limy-looking sort” fetches the highest price\r\nat some yards, as it is found to possess more of the alkaline, or\r\npurifying properties; but others are found to prefer the dark moist\r\nquality. Strange as it may appear, the preference for a particular kind\r\nhas suggested to the finders of Pure the idea of adulterating it to a\r\nvery considerable extent; this is effected by means of mortar broken\r\naway from old walls, and mixed up with the whole mass, which it closely\r\nresembles; in some cases, however, the mortar is rolled into small\r\nballs similar to those found. Hence it would appear, that there is no\r\nbusiness or trade, however insignificant or contemptible, without its\r\nown peculiar and appropriate tricks.\r\n\r\nThe pure-finders are in their habits and mode of proceeding nearly\r\nsimilar to the bone-grubbers. Many of the pure-finders are, however,\r\nbetter in circumstances, the men especially, as they earn more money.\r\nThey are also, to a certain extent, a better educated class. Some of\r\nthe regular collectors of this substance have been mechanics, and\r\nothers small tradesmen, who have been reduced. Those pure-finders who\r\nhave “a good connection,” and have been granted permission to cleanse\r\nsome kennels, obtain a very fair living at the business, earning from\r\n10_s._ to 15_s._ a week. These, however, are very few; the majority\r\nhave to seek the article in the streets, and by such means they can\r\nobtain only from 6_s._ to 10_s._ a week. The average weekly earnings of\r\nthis class are thought to be about 7_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nFrom all the inquiries I have made on this subject, I have found that\r\nthere cannot be less than from 200 to 300 persons constantly engaged\r\nsolely in this business. There are about 30 tanyards large and small\r\nin Bermondsey, and these all have their regular Pure collectors from\r\nwhom they obtain the article. Leomont and Roberts’s, Bavingtons’,\r\nBeech’s, Murrell’s, Cheeseman’s, Powell’s, Jones’s, Jourdans’, Kent’s,\r\nMoorcroft’s, and Davis’s, are among the largest establishments, and\r\nsome idea of the amount of business done in some of these yards may\r\nbe formed from the fact, that the proprietors severally employ from\r\n300 to 500 tanners. At Leomont and Roberts’s there are 23 regular\r\nstreet-finders, who supply them with pure, but this is a large\r\nestablishment, and the number supplying them is considered far beyond\r\nthe average quantity; moreover, Messrs. Leomont and Roberts do more\r\nbusiness in the particular branch of tanning in which the article\r\nis principally used, viz., in dressing the leather for book-covers,\r\nkid-gloves, and a variety of other articles. Some of the other\r\ntanyards, especially the smaller ones, take the substance only as\r\nthey happen to want it, and others again employ but a limited number\r\nof hands. If, therefore, we strike an average, and reduce the number\r\nsupplying each of the several yards to eight, we shall have 240 persons\r\nregularly engaged in the business: besides these, it may be said that\r\nnumbers of the starving and destitute Irish have taken to picking up\r\nthe material, but not knowing where to sell it, or how to dispose of\r\nit, they part with it for 2_d._ or 3_d._ the pail-full to the regular\r\npurveyors of it to the tanyards, who of course make a considerable\r\nprofit by the transaction. The children of the poor Irish are usually\r\nemployed in this manner, but they also pick up rags and bones, and\r\nanything else which may fall in their way.\r\n\r\nI have stated that some of the pure-finders, especially the men, earn\r\na considerable sum of money per week; their gains are sometimes as\r\nmuch as 15_s._; indeed I am assured that seven years ago, when they\r\ngot from 3_s._ to 4_s._ per pail for the pure, that many of them would\r\nnot exchange their position with that of the best paid mechanic in\r\nLondon. Now, however, the case is altered, for there are twenty now at\r\nthe business for every one who followed it then; hence each collects\r\nso much the less in quantity, and, moreover, from the competition gets\r\nso much less for the article. Some of the collectors at present do not\r\nearn 3_s._ per week, but these are mostly old women who are feeble and\r\nunable to get over the ground quickly; others make 5_s._ and 6_s._ in\r\nthe course of the week, while the most active and those who clean out\r\nthe kennels of the dog fanciers may occasionally make 9_s._ and 10_s._\r\nand even 15_s._ a week still, but this is of very rare occurrence.\r\nAllowing the finders, one with the other, to earn on an average 5_s._\r\nper week, it would give the annual earnings of each to be 13_l._,\r\nwhile the income of the whole 200 would amount to 50_l._ a week, or\r\n2600_l._ per annum. The kennel “pure” is not much valued, indeed many\r\nof the tanners will not even buy it, the reason is that the dogs of\r\nthe “fanciers” are fed on almost anything, to save expense; the kennel\r\ncleaners consequently take the precaution of mixing it with what is\r\nfound in the street, previous to offering it for sale.\r\n\r\nThe pure-finder may at once be distinguished from the bone-grubber and\r\nrag-gatherer; the latter, as I have before mentioned, carries a bag,\r\nand usually a stick armed with a spike, while he is most frequently\r\nto be met with in back streets, narrow lanes, yards and other places,\r\nwhere dust and rubbish are likely to be thrown out from the adjacent\r\nhouses. The pure-finder, on the contrary, is often found in the open\r\nstreets, as dogs wander where they like. The pure-finders always carry\r\na handle basket, generally with a cover, to hide the contents, and have\r\ntheir right hand covered with a black leather glove; many of them,\r\nhowever, dispense with the glove, as they say it is much easier to wash\r\ntheir hands than to keep the glove fit for use. The women generally\r\nhave a large pocket for the reception of such rags as they may chance\r\nto fall in with, but they pick up those only of the very best quality,\r\nand will not go out of their way to search even for them. Thus equipped\r\nthey may be seen pursuing their avocation in almost every street in and\r\nabout London, excepting such streets as are now cleansed by the “street\r\norderlies,” of whom the pure-finders grievously complain, as being an\r\nunwarrantable interference with the privileges of their class.\r\n\r\nThe pure collected is used by leather-dressers and tanners, and more\r\nespecially by those engaged in the manufacture of morocco and kid\r\nleather from the skins of old and young goats, of which skins great\r\nnumbers are imported, and of the roans and lambskins which are the\r\nsham morocco and kids of the “slop” leather trade, and are used by the\r\nbetter class of shoemakers, bookbinders, and glovers, for the inferior\r\nrequirements of their business. Pure is also used by tanners, as is\r\npigeon’s dung, for the tanning of the thinner kinds of leather, such as\r\ncalf-skins, for which purpose it is placed in pits with an admixture of\r\nlime and bark.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of moroccos and roans the pure is rubbed by the\r\nhands of the workman into the skin he is dressing. This is done to\r\n“purify” the leather, I was told by an intelligent leather-dresser, and\r\nfrom that term the word “pure” has originated. The dung has astringent\r\nas well as highly alkaline, or, to use the expression of my informant,\r\n“scouring,” qualities. When the pure has been rubbed into the flesh and\r\ngrain of the skin (the “flesh” being originally the interior, and the\r\n“grain” the exterior part of the cuticle), and the skin, thus purified,\r\nhas been hung up to be dried, the dung removes, as it were, all such\r\nmoisture as, if allowed to remain, would tend to make the leather\r\nunsound or imperfectly dressed. This imperfect dressing, moreover,\r\ngives a disagreeable smell to the leather--and leather-buyers often use\r\nboth nose and tongue in making their purchases--and would consequently\r\nprevent that agreeable odour being imparted to the skin which is found\r\nin some kinds of morocco and kid. The peculiar odour of the Russia\r\nleather, so agreeable in the libraries of the rich, is derived from the\r\nbark of young birch trees. It is now manufactured in Bermondsey.\r\n\r\nAmong the morocco manufacturers, especially among the old operatives,\r\nthere is often a scarcity of employment, and they then dress a few\r\nroans, which they hawk to the cheap warehouses, or sell to the\r\nwholesale shoemakers on their own account. These men usually reside in\r\nsmall garrets in the poorer parts of Bermondsey, and carry on their\r\ntrade in their own rooms, using and keeping the pure there; hence\r\nthe “homes” of these poor men are peculiarly uncomfortable, if not\r\nunhealthy. Some of these poor fellows or their wives collect the pure\r\nthemselves, often starting at daylight for the purpose; they more\r\nfrequently, however, buy it of a regular finder.\r\n\r\nThe number of pure-finders I heard estimated, by a man well acquainted\r\nwith the tanning and other departments of the leather trade, at from\r\n200 to 250. The finders, I was informed by the same person, collected\r\nabout a pail-full a day, clearing 6_s._ a week in the summer--1_s._\r\nand 1_s._ 2_d._ being the charge for a pail-full; in the short days\r\nof winter, however, and in bad weather, they could not collect five\r\npail-fulls in a week.\r\n\r\nIn the wretched locality already referred to as lying between the Docks\r\nand Rosemary-lane, redolent of filth and pregnant with pestilential\r\ndiseases, and whither all the outcasts of the metropolitan population\r\nseem to be drawn, either in the hope of finding fitting associates and\r\ncompanions in their wretchedness (for there is doubtlessly something\r\nattractive and agreeable to them in such companionship), or else for\r\nthe purpose of hiding themselves and their shifts and struggles for\r\nexistence from the world,--in this dismal quarter, and branching from\r\none of the many narrow lanes which interlace it, there is a little\r\ncourt with about half-a-dozen houses of the very smallest dimensions,\r\nconsisting of merely two rooms, one over the other. Here in one of\r\nthe upper rooms (the lower one of the same house being occupied by\r\nanother family and apparently _filled_ with little ragged children), I\r\ndiscerned, after considerable difficulty, an old woman, a Pure-finder.\r\nWhen I opened the door the little light that struggled through the\r\nsmall window, the many broken panes of which were stuffed with old\r\nrags, was not sufficient to enable me to perceive who or what was in\r\nthe room. After a short time, however, I began to make out an old\r\nchair standing near the fire-place, and then to discover a poor old\r\nwoman resembling a bundle of rags and filth stretched on some dirty\r\nstraw in the corner of the apartment. The place was bare and almost\r\nnaked. There was nothing in it except a couple of old tin kettles and a\r\nbasket, and some broken crockeryware in the recess of the window. To my\r\nastonishment I found this wretched creature to be, to a certain extent,\r\na “superior” woman; she could read and write well, spoke correctly, and\r\nappeared to have been a person of natural good sense, though broken up\r\nwith age, want, and infirmity, so that she was characterized by all\r\nthat dull and hardened stupidity of manner which I have noticed in the\r\nclass. She made the following statement:--\r\n\r\n“I am about 60 years of age. My father was a milkman, and very well\r\noff; he had a barn and a great many cows. I was kept at school till I\r\nwas thirteen or fourteen years of age; about that time my father died,\r\nand then I was taken home to help my mother in the business. After a\r\nwhile things went wrong; the cows began to die, and mother, alleging\r\nshe could not manage the business herself, married again. I soon found\r\nout the difference. Glad to get away, anywhere out of the house, I\r\nmarried a sailor, and was very comfortable with him for some years; as\r\nhe made short voyages, and was often at home, and always left me half\r\nhis pay. At last he was pressed, when at home with me, and sent away;\r\nI forget now where he was sent to, but I never saw him from that day\r\nto this. The only thing I know is that some sailors came to me four\r\nor five years after, and told me that he deserted from the ship in\r\nwhich he had gone out, and got on board the _Neptune_, East Indiaman,\r\nbound for Bombay, where he acted as boatswain’s mate; some little time\r\nafterwards, he had got intoxicated while the ship was lying in harbour,\r\nand, going down the side to get into a bumboat, and buy more drink,\r\nhe had fallen overboard and was drowned. I got some money that was\r\ndue to him from the India House, and, after that was all gone, I went\r\ninto service, in the Mile-end Road. There I stayed for several years,\r\ntill I met my second husband, who was bred to the water, too, but as a\r\nwaterman on the river. We did very well together for a long time, till\r\nhe lost his health. He became paralyzed like, and was deprived of the\r\nuse of all one side, and nearly lost the sight of one of his eyes; this\r\nwas not very conspicuous at first, but when we came to get pinched, and\r\nto be badly off, then any one might have seen that there was something\r\nthe matter with his eye. Then we parted with everything we had in the\r\nworld; and, at last, when we had no other means of living left, we\r\nwere advised to take to gathering ‘Pure.’ At first I couldn’t endure\r\nthe business; I couldn’t bear to eat a morsel, and I was obliged to\r\ndiscontinue it for a long time. My husband kept at it though, for he\r\ncould do _that_ well enough, only he couldn’t walk as fast as he ought.\r\nHe couldn’t lift his hands as high as his head, but he managed to work\r\nunder him, and so put the Pure in the basket. When I saw that he, poor\r\nfellow, couldn’t make enough to keep us both, I took heart and went out\r\nagain, and used to gather more than he did; that’s fifteen years ago\r\nnow; the times were good then, and we used to do very well. If we only\r\ngathered a pail-full in the day, we could live very well; but we could\r\ndo much more than that, for there wasn’t near so many at the business\r\nthen, and the Pure was easier to be had. For my part I can’t tell where\r\nall the poor creatures have come from of late years; the world seems\r\ngrowing worse and worse every day. They have pulled down the price of\r\nPure, that’s certain; but the poor things must do something, they can’t\r\nstarve while there’s anything to be got. Why, no later than six or\r\nseven years ago, it was as high as 3_s._ 6_d._ and 4_s._ a pail-full,\r\nand a ready sale for as much of it as you could get; but now you can\r\nonly get 1_s._ and in some places 1_s._ 2_d._ a pail-full; and, as\r\nI said before, there are so many at it, that there is not much left\r\nfor a poor old creature like me to find. The men that are strong and\r\nsmart get the most, of course, and some of them do very well, at least\r\nthey manage to live. Six years ago, my husband complained that he was\r\nill, in the evening, and lay down in the bed--we lived in Whitechapel\r\nthen--he took a fit of coughing, and was smothered in his own blood. O\r\ndear” (the poor old soul here ejaculated), “what troubles I have gone\r\nthrough! I had eight children at one time, and there is not one of them\r\nalive now. My daughter lived to 30 years of age, and then she died in\r\nchildbirth, and, since then, I have had nobody in the wide world to\r\ncare for me--none but myself, all alone as I am. After my husband’s\r\ndeath I couldn’t do much, and all my things went away, one by one,\r\nuntil I’ve nothing but bare walls, and that’s the reason why I was\r\nvexed at first at your coming in, sir. I was yesterday out all day, and\r\nwent round Aldgate, Whitechapel, St. George’s East, Stepney, Bow, and\r\nBromley, and then came home; after that, I went over to Bermondsey,\r\nand there I got only 6_d._ for my pains. To-day I wasn’t out at all;\r\nI wasn’t well; I had a bad headache, and I’m so much afraid of the\r\nfevers that are all about here--though I don’t know why I should be\r\nafraid of them--I was lying down, when you came, to get rid of my\r\npains. There’s such a dizziness in my head now, I feel as if it didn’t\r\nbelong to me. No, I have earned no money to-day. I have had a piece\r\nof dried bread that I steeped in water to eat. I haven’t eat anything\r\nelse to-day; but, pray, sir, don’t tell anybody of it. I could never\r\nbear the thought of going into the ‘great house’ [workhouse]; I’m so\r\nused to the air, that I’d sooner die in the street, as many I know have\r\ndone. I’ve known several of our people, who have sat down in the street\r\nwith their basket alongside them, and died. I knew one not long ago,\r\nwho took ill just as she was stooping down to gather up the Pure, and\r\nfell on her face; she was taken to the London Hospital, and died at\r\nthree o’clock in the morning. I’d sooner die like them than be deprived\r\nof my liberty, and be prevented from going about where I liked. No,\r\nI’ll never go into the workhouse; my master is kind to me” [the tanner\r\nwhom she supplies]. “When I’m ill, he sometimes gives me a sixpence;\r\nbut there’s one gentleman has done us great harm, by forcing so many\r\ninto the business. He’s a poor-law guardian, and when any poor person\r\napplies for relief, he tells them to go and gather Pure, and that\r\nhe’ll buy it of them (for he’s in the line), and so the parish, you\r\nsee, don’t have to give anything, and that’s one way that so many have\r\ncome into the trade of late, that the likes of me can do little or no\r\ngood at it. Almost every one I’ve ever known engaged at Pure-finding\r\nwere people who were better off once. I knew a man who went by the\r\nname of Brown, who picked up Pure for years before I went to it; he\r\nwas a very quiet man; he used to lodge in Blue Anchor-yard, and seldom\r\nused to speak to anybody. We two used to talk together sometimes,\r\nbut never much. One morning he was found dead in his bed; it was of\r\na Tuesday morning, and he was buried about 12 o’clock on the Friday\r\nfollowing. About 6 o’clock on that afternoon, three or four gentlemen\r\ncame searching all through this place, looking for a man named Brown,\r\nand offering a reward to any who would find him out; there was a whole\r\ncrowd about them when I came up. One of the gentlemen said that the man\r\nthey wanted had lost the first finger of his right hand, and then I\r\nknew that it was the man that had been buried only that morning. Would\r\nyou believe it, Mr. Brown was a real gentleman all the time, and had a\r\nlarge estate, of I don’t know how many thousand pounds, just left him,\r\nand the lawyers had advertised and searched everywhere for him, but\r\nnever found him, you may say, till he was dead. We discovered that his\r\nname was not Brown; he had only taken that name to hide his real one,\r\nwhich, of course, he did not want any one to know. I’ve often thought\r\nof him, poor man, and all the misery he might have been spared, if the\r\ngood news had only come a year or two sooner.”\r\n\r\nAnother informant, a Pure-collector, was originally in the Manchester\r\ncotton trade, and held a lucrative situation in a large country\r\nestablishment. His salary one year exceeded 250_l._, and his regular\r\nincome was 150_l._ “This,” he says, “I lost through drink and neglect.\r\nMy master was exceedingly kind to me, and has even assisted me since I\r\nleft his employ. He bore with me patiently for many years, but the love\r\nof drink was so strong upon me that it was impossible for him to keep\r\nme any longer.” He has often been drunk, he tells me, for three months\r\ntogether; and he is now so reduced that he is ashamed to be seen. When\r\nat his master’s it was his duty to carve and help the other assistants\r\nbelonging to the establishment, and his hand used to shake so violently\r\nthat he has been ashamed to lift the gravy spoon.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast he has frequently waited till all the young men had left\r\nthe table before he ventured to taste his tea; and immediately, when he\r\nwas alone, he has bent his head down to his cup to drink, being utterly\r\nincapable of raising it to his lips. He says he is a living example of\r\nthe degrading influence of drink. All his friends have deserted him. He\r\nhas suffered enough, he tells me, to make him give it up. He earned the\r\nweek before I saw him 5_s._ 2_d._; and the week before that, 6_s._\r\n\r\nBefore leaving me I prevailed upon the man to “take the pledge.” This\r\nis now eighteen months ago, and I have not seen him since.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CIGAR-END FINDERS.\r\n\r\nThere are, strictly speaking, none who make a living by picking up the\r\nends of cigars thrown away as useless by the smokers in the streets,\r\nbut there are very many who employ themselves from time to time in\r\ncollecting them. Almost all the street-finders, when they meet with\r\nsuch things, pick them up, and keep them in a pocket set apart for\r\nthat purpose. The men allow the ends to accumulate till they amount to\r\ntwo or three pounds weight, and then some dispose of them to a person\r\nresiding in the neighbourhood of Rosemary-lane, who buys them all\r\nup at from 6_d._ to 10_d._ per pound, according to their length and\r\nquality. The long ends are considered the best, as I am told there is\r\nmore sound tobacco in them, uninjured by the moisture of the mouth.\r\nThe children of the poor Irish, in particular, scour Ratcliff-highway,\r\nthe Commercial-road, Mile-end-road, and all the leading thoroughfares\r\nof the East, and every place where cigar smokers are likely to take an\r\nevening’s promenade. The quantity that each of them collects is very\r\ntrifling indeed--perhaps not more than a handful during a morning’s\r\nsearch. I am informed, by an intelligent man living in the midst of\r\nthem, that these children go out in the morning not only to gather\r\ncigar-ends, but to pick up out of dust bins, and from amongst rubbish\r\nin the streets, the smallest scraps and crusts of bread, no matter how\r\nhard or filthy they may be. These they put into a little bag which\r\nthey carry for the purpose, and, after they have gone their rounds\r\nand collected whatever they can, they take the cigar-ends to the man\r\nwho buys them--sometimes getting not more than a halfpenny or a penny\r\nfor their morning’s collection. With this they buy a halfpenny or a\r\npennyworth of oatmeal, which they mix up with a large quantity of\r\nwater, and after washing and steeping the hard and dirty crusts, they\r\nput them into the pot or kettle and boil all together. Of this mass the\r\nwhole family partake, and it often constitutes all the food they taste\r\nin the course of the day. I have often seen the bone-grubbers eat the\r\nblack and soddened crusts they have picked up out of the gutter.\r\n\r\nIt would, indeed, be a hopeless task to make any attempt to get at the\r\nnumber of persons who occasionally or otherwise pick up cigar-ends with\r\nthe view of selling them again. For this purpose almost all who ransack\r\nthe streets of London for a living may be computed as belonging to\r\nthe class; and to these should be added the children of the thousands\r\nof destitute Irish who have inundated the metropolis within the last\r\nfew years, and who are to be found huddled together in all the low\r\nneighbourhoods in every suburb of the City. What quantity is collected,\r\nor the amount of money obtained for the ends, there are no means of\r\nascertaining.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, make a conjecture. There are in round numbers\r\n300,000 inhabited houses in the metropolis; and allowing the married\r\npeople living in apartments to be equal in number to the unmarried\r\n“housekeepers,” we may compute that the number of families in London\r\nis about the same as the inhabited houses. Assuming one young or old\r\ngentleman in every ten of these families to smoke one cigar per diem in\r\nthe public thoroughfares, we have 30,000 cigar-ends daily, or 210,000\r\nweekly cast away in the London streets. Now, reckoning 150 cigars to go\r\nto a pound, we may assume that each end so cast away weighs about the\r\nthousandth part of a pound; consequently the gross weight of the ends\r\nflung into the gutter will, in the course of the week, amount to about\r\n2 cwt.; and calculating that only a sixth part of these are picked up\r\nby the finders, it follows that there is very nearly a ton of refuse\r\ntobacco collected annually in the metropolitan thoroughfares.\r\n\r\nThe aristocratic quarters of the City and the vicinity of theatres\r\nand casinos are the best for the cigar-end finders. In the Strand,\r\nRegent-street, and the more fashionable thoroughfares, I am told,\r\nthere are many ends picked up; but even in these places they do not\r\nexclusively furnish a means of living to any of the finders. All the\r\ncollectors sell them to some other person, who acts as middle-man\r\nin the business. How he disposes of the ends is unknown, but it is\r\nsupposed that they are resold to some of the large manufacturers of\r\ncigars, and go to form the component part of a new stock of the “best\r\nHavannahs;” or, in other words, they are worked up again to be again\r\ncast away, and again collected by the finders, and so on perhaps, till\r\nthe millennium comes. Some suppose them to be cut up and mixed with the\r\ncommon smoking tobacco, and others that they are used in making snuff.\r\nThere are, I am assured, five persons residing in different parts of\r\nLondon, who are known to purchase the cigar-ends.\r\n\r\nIn Naples the sale of cigar-ends is a regular street-traffic, the\r\nstreet-seller carrying them in a small box suspended round the neck.\r\nIn Paris, also, _le Remasseur de Cigares_ is a well-known occupation:\r\nthe “ends” thus collected are sold as cheap tobacco to the poor. In\r\nthe low lodging-houses of London the ends, when dried, are cut up, and\r\nfrequently vended by the finders to such of their fellow-lodgers as are\r\nanxious to enjoy their pipe at the cheapest possible rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE OLD WOOD GATHERERS.\r\n\r\nAll that has been said of the cigar-end finders may, in a great\r\nmeasure, apply to the wood-gatherers. No one can make a living\r\nexclusively by the gathering of wood, and those who _do_ gather it,\r\ngather as well rags, bones, and bits of metal. They gather it, indeed,\r\nas an adjunct to their other findings, on the principle that “every\r\nlittle helps.” Those, however, who most frequently look for wood are\r\nthe very old and feeble, and the very young, who are both unable to\r\ntravel far, or to carry a heavy burden, and they may occasionally be\r\nseen crawling about in the neighbourhood of any new buildings in the\r\ncourse of construction, or old ones in the course of demolition, and\r\npicking up small odds and ends of wood and chips swept out amongst\r\ndirt and shavings; these they deposit in a bag or basket which they\r\ncarry for that purpose. Should there happen to be what they call\r\n“pulling-down work,” that is, taking down old houses, or palings, the\r\nplace is immediately beset by a number of wood-gatherers, young and\r\nold, and in general all the poor people of the locality join with them,\r\nto obtain their share of the spoil. What the poor get they take home\r\nand burn, but the wood-gatherers sell all they procure for some small\r\ntrifle.\r\n\r\nSome short time ago a portion of the wood-pavement in the city was\r\nbeing removed; a large number of the old blocks, which were much worn\r\nand of no further use, were thrown aside, and became the perquisite\r\nof the wood-gatherers. During the repair of the street, the spot was\r\nconstantly besieged by a motley mob of men, women, and children, who,\r\nin many instances, struggled and fought for the wood rejected as\r\nworthless. This wood they either sold for a trifle as they got it, or\r\ntook home and split, and made into bundles for sale as firewood.\r\n\r\nAll the mudlarks (of whom I shall treat specially) pick up wood and\r\nchips on the bank of the river; these they sell to poor people in their\r\nown neighbourhood. They sometimes “find” large pieces of a greater\r\nweight than they can carry; in such cases they get some other mudlark\r\nto help them with the load, and the two “go halves” in the produce. The\r\nonly parties among the street-finders who do not pick up wood are the\r\nPure-collectors and the sewer-hunters, or, as they call themselves,\r\nshore-workers, both of whom pass it by as of no value.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to estimate the quantity of wood which is thus\r\ngathered, or what the amount may be which the collector realises in the\r\ncourse of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DREDGERS, OR RIVER FINDERS.\r\n\r\nThe dredgermen of the Thames, or river finders, naturally occupy the\r\nsame place with reference to the street-finders, as the purlmen or\r\nriver beer-sellers do to those who get their living by selling in the\r\nstreets. It would be in itself a curious inquiry to trace the origin\r\nof the manifold occupations in which men are found to be engaged in\r\nthe present day, and to note how promptly every circumstance and\r\noccurrence was laid hold of, as it happened to arise, which appeared to\r\nhave any tendency to open up a new occupation, and to mark the gradual\r\nprogress, till it became a regularly-established employment, followed\r\nby a separate class of people, fenced round by rules and customs of\r\ntheir own, and who at length grew to be both in their habits and\r\npeculiarities plainly distinct from the other classes among whom they\r\nchanced to be located.\r\n\r\nThere has been no historian among the dredgers of the Thames to record\r\nthe commencement of the business, and the utmost that any of the\r\nriver-finders can tell is that his father had been a dredger, and so\r\nhad his father before him, and that _that’s_ the reason why they are\r\ndredgers also. But no such people as dredgers were known on the Thames\r\nin remote days; and before London had become an important trading\r\nport, where nothing was likely to be got for the searching, it is not\r\nprobable that people would have been induced to search. In those days,\r\nthe only things searched for in the river were the bodies of persons\r\ndrowned, accidentally or otherwise. For this purpose, the Thames\r\nfishermen of all others, appeared to be the best adapted. They were on\r\nthe spot at all times, and had various sorts of tackle, such as nets,\r\nlines, hooks, &c. The fishermen well understood everything connected\r\nwith the river, such as the various sets of the tide, and the nature\r\nof the bottom, and they were therefore on such occasions invariably\r\napplied to for these purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is known to all who remember anything of Old London Bridge, that at\r\ncertain times of the tide, in consequence of the velocity with which\r\nthe water rushed through the narrow apertures which the arches then\r\nafforded for its passage, to bring a boat in safety through the bridge\r\nwas a feat to be attempted only by the skilful and experienced. This\r\nfeat was known as “shooting” London Bridge; and it was no unusual thing\r\nfor accidents to happen even to the most expert. In fact, numerous\r\naccidents occurred at this bridge, and at such times valuable articles\r\nwere sometimes lost, for which high rewards were offered to the finder.\r\nHere again the fishermen came into requisition, the small drag-net,\r\nwhich they used while rowing, offering itself for the purpose; for,\r\nby fixing an iron frame round the mouth of the drag-net, this part\r\nof it, from its specific gravity, sunk first to the bottom, and\r\nconsequently scraped along as they pulled forward, collecting into the\r\nnet everything that came in its way; when it was nearly filled, which\r\nthe rower always knew by the weight, it was hauled up to the surface,\r\nits contents examined, and the object lost generally recovered.\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that the fishermen of the Thames were the men\r\noriginally employed as dredgermen; though casually, indeed, at first,\r\nand according as circumstances occurred requiring their services. By\r\ndegrees, however, as the commerce of the river increased, and a greater\r\nnumber of articles fell overboard from the shipping, they came to be\r\nmore frequently called into requisition, and so they were naturally led\r\nto adopt the dredging as part and parcel of their business. Thus it\r\nremains to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen all serve a regular apprenticeship, as they say\r\nthemselves, “duly and truly” for seven years. During the time of their\r\napprenticeship they are (or rather, in former times they _were_)\r\nobliged to sleep in their master’s boat at night to take care of his\r\nproperty, and were subject to many other curious regulations, which are\r\nforeign to this subject.\r\n\r\nI have said that the fishermen of the Thames to the present day unite\r\nthe dredging to their proper calling. By this I mean that they employ\r\nthemselves in fishing during the summer and autumn, either from\r\nBarking Creek downwards, or from Chelsea Reach upwards, catching dabs,\r\nflounders, eels, and other sorts of fish for the London markets. But in\r\nwinter when the days are short and cold, and the weather stormy, they\r\nprefer stopping at home, and dredging the bed of the river for anything\r\nthey may chance to find. There are others, however, who have started\r\nwholly in the dredging line, there being no hindrance or impediment\r\nto any one doing so, nor any licence required for the purpose: these\r\ndredge the river winter and summer alike, and are, in fact, the only\r\nreal dredgermen of the present day living solely by that occupation.\r\n\r\nThere are in all about 100 dredgermen at work on the river, and these\r\nare located as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                     Dredgermen.\r\n  From Putney to Vauxhall there are      20\r\n  From Vauxhall to London-bridge         40\r\n  From London-bridge to Deptford         20\r\n  And from Deptford to Gravesend         20\r\n                                        ---\r\n                                        100\r\n\r\nAll these reside, in general, on the south side of the Thames, the two\r\nplaces most frequented by them being Lambeth and Rotherhithe. They do\r\nnot, however, confine themselves to the neighbourhoods wherein they\r\nreside, but extend their operations to all parts of the river, where\r\nit is likely that they may pick up anything; and it is perfectly\r\nmarvellous with what rapidity the intelligence of any accident\r\ncalculated to afford them employment is spread among them; for should\r\na loaded coal barge be sunk over night, by daylight the next morning\r\nevery dredgerman would be sure to be upon the spot, prepared to collect\r\nwhat he could from the wreck at the bottom of the river.\r\n\r\nThe boats of the dredgermen are of a peculiar shape. They have no\r\nstern, but are the same fore and aft. They are called Peter boats,\r\nbut not one of the men with whom I spoke had the least idea as to the\r\norigin of the name. These boats are to be had at almost all prices,\r\naccording to their condition and age--from 30_s._ to 20_l._ The boats\r\nused by the fishermen dredgermen are decidedly the most valuable. One\r\nwith the other, perhaps the whole may average 10_l._ each; and this sum\r\nwill give 1000_l._ as the value of the entire number. A complete set\r\nof tackle, including drags, will cost 2_l._, which comes to 200_l._\r\nfor all hands; and thus we have the sum of 1200_l._ as the amount of\r\ncapital invested in the dredging of the Thames.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means an easy matter to form any estimate of the earnings\r\nof the dredgermen, as they are a matter of mere chance. In former\r\nyears, when Indiamen and all the foreign shipping lay in the river,\r\nthe river finders were in the habit of doing a good business, not only\r\nin their own line, through the greater quantities of rope, bones,\r\nand other things which then were thrown or fell overboard, but they\r\nalso contrived to smuggle ashore great quantities of tobacco, tea,\r\nspirits, and other contraband articles, and thought it a bad day’s work\r\nwhen they did not earn a pound independent of their dredging. An old\r\ndredger told me he had often in those days made 5_l._ before breakfast\r\ntime. After the excavation of the various docks, and after the larger\r\nshipping had departed from the river, the finders were obliged to\r\ncontent themselves with the chances of mere dredging; and even then, I\r\nam informed, they were in the habit of earning one week with another\r\nthroughout the year, about 25_s._ per week, each, or 6500_l._ per annum\r\namong all. Latterly, however, the earnings of these men have greatly\r\nfallen off, especially in the summer, for then they cannot get so good\r\na price for the coal they find as in the winter--6_d._ per bushel being\r\nthe summer price; and, as they consider three bushels a good day’s\r\nwork, their earnings at this period of the year amount only to 1_s._\r\n6_d._ per day, excepting when they happen to pick up some bones or\r\npieces of metal, or to find a dead body for which there is a reward. In\r\nthe winter, however, the dredgermen can readily get 1_s._ per bushel\r\nfor all the coals they find; and far more coals are to be found then\r\nthan in summer, for there are more colliers in the river, and far more\r\naccidents at that season. Coal barges are often sunk in the winter,\r\nand on such occasions they make a good harvest. Moreover there is the\r\nfinding of bodies, for which they not only get the reward, but 5_s._,\r\nwhich they call inquest money; together with many other chances, such\r\nas the finding of money and valuables among the rubbish they bring up\r\nfrom the bottom; but as the last-mentioned are accidents happening\r\nthroughout the year, I am inclined to think that they have understated\r\nthe amount which they are in the habit of realizing even in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe dredgers, as a class, may be said to be altogether uneducated, not\r\nhalf a dozen out of the whole number being able to read their own name,\r\nand only one or two to write it; this select few are considered by the\r\nrest as perfect prodigies. “Lor’ bless you!” said one, “I on’y wish\r\nyou’d ’ear Bill S---- read; I on’y jist wish you’d ’ear him. Why that\r\nere Bill can read faster nor a dog can trot. And, what’s more, I seed\r\nhim write an ole letter hisself, ev’ry word on it! What do you think\r\no’ that now?” The ignorance of the dredgermen may be accounted for by\r\nthe men taking so early to the water; the bustle and excitement of the\r\nriver being far more attractive to them than the routine of a school.\r\nAlmost as soon as they are able to do anything, the dredgermen’s boys\r\nare taken by their fathers afloat to assist in picking out the coals,\r\nbones, and other things of any use, from the midst of the rubbish\r\nbrought up in their drag-nets; or else the lads are sent on board\r\nas assistants to one or other of the fishermen during their fishing\r\nvoyages. When once engaged in this way it has been found impossible\r\nafterwards to keep the youths from the water; and if they have learned\r\nanything previously they very soon forget it.\r\n\r\nIt might be expected that the dredgers, in a manner depending on\r\nchance for their livelihood, and leading a restless sort of life on\r\nthe water, would closely resemble the costermongers in their habits;\r\nbut it is far otherwise. There can be no two classes more dissimilar,\r\nexcept in their hatred of restraint. The dredgers are sober and steady;\r\ngambling is unknown amongst them; and they are, to an extraordinary\r\ndegree, laborious, persevering, and patient. They are in general men of\r\nshort stature, but square built, strong, and capable of enduring great\r\nfatigue, and have a silent and thoughtful look. Being almost always\r\nalone, and studying how they may best succeed in finding what they\r\nseek, marking the various sets of the tide, and the direction in which\r\nthings falling into the water at a particular place must necessarily\r\nbe carried, they become the very opposite to the other river people,\r\nespecially to the watermen, who are brawling and clamorous, and delight\r\nin continually “chaffing” each other. In consequence of the sober and\r\nindustrious habits of the dredgermen their homes are, as they say,\r\n“pretty fair” for working men, though there is nothing very luxurious\r\nto be found in them, nor indeed anything beyond what is absolutely\r\nnecessary. After their day’s work, especially if they have “done well,”\r\nthese men smoke a pipe over a pint or two of beer at the nearest\r\npublic-house, get home early to bed, and if the tide answers may be\r\nfound on the river patiently dredging away at two or three o’clock in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nWhenever a loaded coal barge happens to sink, as I have already\r\nintimated, it is surprising how short a time elapses before that part\r\nof the river is alive with the dredgers. They flock thither from all\r\nparts. The river on such occasions presents a very animated appearance.\r\nAt first they are all in a group, and apparently in confusion, crossing\r\nand re-crossing each other’s course; some with their oars pulled in\r\nwhile they examine the contents of their nets, and empty the coals\r\ninto the bottom of their boats; others rowing and tugging against the\r\nstream, to obtain an advantageous position for the next cast; and when\r\nthey consider they have found this, down go the dredging-nets to the\r\nbottom, and away they row again with the stream, as if pulling for a\r\nwager, till they find by the weight of their net that it is full; then\r\nthey at once stop, haul it to the surface, and commence another course.\r\nOthers who have been successful in getting their boats loaded may be\r\nseen pushing away from the main body, and making towards the shore.\r\nHere they busily employ themselves, with what help they can get, in\r\nemptying the boat of her cargo--carrying it ashore in old coal baskets,\r\nbushel measures, or anything else which will suit their purpose; and\r\nwhen this is completed they pull out again to join their comrades, and\r\ncommence afresh. They continue working thus till the returning tide\r\nputs an end to their labours, but these are resumed after the tide has\r\nfallen to a certain depth; and so they go on, working night and day\r\nwhile there is anything to be got.\r\n\r\nThe dredgerman and his boat may be immediately distinguished from\r\nall others; there is nothing similar to them on the river. The sharp\r\ncutwater fore and aft, and short rounded appearance of the vessel,\r\nmarks it out at once from the skiff or wherry of the waterman. There\r\nis, too, always the appearance of labour about the boat, like a ship\r\nreturning after a long voyage, daubed and filthy, and looking sadly in\r\nneed of a thorough cleansing. The grappling irons are over the bow,\r\nresting on a coil of rope; while the other end of the boat is filled\r\nwith coals, bones, and old rope, mixed with the mud of the river. The\r\nropes of the dredging-net hang over the side. A short stout figure,\r\nwith a face soiled and blackened with perspiration, and surmounted by a\r\ntarred sou’-wester, the body habited in a soiled check shirt, with the\r\nsleeves turned up above the elbows, and exhibiting a pair of sunburnt\r\nbrawny arms, is pulling at the sculls, not with the ease and lightness\r\nof the waterman, but toiling and tugging away like a galley slave, as\r\nhe scours the bed of the river with his dredging-net in search of some\r\nhoped-for prize.\r\n\r\nThe dredgers, as was before stated, are the men who find almost all\r\nthe bodies of persons drowned. If there be a reward offered for the\r\nrecovery of a body, numbers of the dredgers will at once endeavour to\r\nobtain it, while if there be no reward, there is at least the inquest\r\nmoney to be had--beside other chances. What these chances are may\r\nbe inferred from the well-known fact, that no body recovered by a\r\ndredgerman ever happens to have any money about it, when brought to\r\nshore. There may, indeed, be a watch in the fob or waistcoat pocket,\r\nfor that article would be likely to be traced. There may, too, be a\r\npurse or pocket-book forthcoming, but somehow it is invariably empty.\r\nThe dredgers cannot by any reasoning or argument be made to comprehend\r\nthat there is anything like dishonesty in emptying the pockets of a\r\ndead man. They consider them as their just perquisites. They say that\r\nany one who finds a body does precisely the same, and that if they\r\ndid not do so the police would. After having had all the trouble and\r\nlabour, they allege that they have a much better right to whatever\r\nis to be got, than the police who have had nothing whatever to do\r\nwith it. There are also people who shrewdly suspect that some of the\r\ncoals from the barges lying in the river, very often find their way\r\ninto the dredgers’ boats, especially when the dredgers are engaged in\r\nnight-work; and there are even some who do not hold them guiltless of,\r\nnow and then, when opportunity offers, smuggling things ashore from\r\nmany of the steamers coming from foreign parts. But such things, I\r\nrepeat, the dredgers consider in the fair way of their business.\r\n\r\nOne of the most industrious, and I believe one of the most skilful and\r\nsuccessful of this peculiar class, gave me the following epitome of his\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n“Father was a dredger, and grandfather afore him; grandfather was a\r\ndredger and a fisherman too. A’most as soon as I was able to crawl,\r\nfather took me with him in the boat to help him to pick the coals, and\r\nbones, and other things out of the net, and to use me to the water.\r\nWhen I got bigger and stronger, I was sent to the parish school, but I\r\ndidn’t like it half as well as the boat, and couldn’t be got to stay\r\ntwo days together. At last I went above bridge, and went along with a\r\nfisherman, and used to sleep in the boat every night. I liked to sleep\r\nin the boat; I used to be as comfortable as could be. Lor bless you!\r\nthere’s a tilt to them boats, and no rain can’t git at you. I used to\r\nlie awake of a night in them times, and listen to the water shipping\r\nag’in the boat, and think it fine fun. I might a got bound ’prentice,\r\nbut I got aboard a smack, where I stayed three or four year, and if I’d\r\na stayed there, I’d a liked it much better. But I heerd as how father\r\nwas ill, so I com’d home, and took to the dredging, and am at it off\r\nand on ever since. I got no larnin’, how could I? There’s on’y one or\r\ntwo of us dredgers as knows anything of larnin’, and they’re no better\r\noff than the rest. Larnin’s no use to a dredger, he hasn’t got no time\r\nto read; and if he had, why it wouldn’t tell him where the holes and\r\nfurrows is at the bottom of the river, and where things is to be found.\r\nTo be sure there’s holes and furrows at the bottom. I know a good many.\r\nI know a furrow off Lime’us Point, no wider nor the dredge, and I can\r\ngo there, and when others can’t git anything but stones and mud, I\r\ncan git four or five bushel o’ coal. You see they lay there; they get\r\nin with the set of the tide, and can’t git out so easy like. Dredgers\r\ndon’t do so well now as they used to do. You know Pelican Stairs?\r\nwell, before the Docks was built, when the ships lay there, I could\r\ngo under Pelican Pier and pick up four or five shilling of a morning.\r\nWhat was that tho’ to father? I hear him say he often made 5_l._ afore\r\nbreakfast, and nobody ever the wiser. Them were fine times! there was\r\na good livin’ to be picked up on the water them days. About ten year\r\nago, the fishermen at Lambeth, them as sarves their time ‘duly and\r\ntruly’ thought to put us off the water, and went afore the Lord Mayor,\r\nbut they couldn’t do nothink after all. They do better nor us, as they\r\ngo fishin’ all the summer, when the dredgin’ is bad, and come back in\r\nwinter. Some on us down here” [Rotherhithe] “go a deal-portering in the\r\nsummer, or unloading ’tatoes, or anything else we can get; when we have\r\nnothin’ else to do, we go on the river. Father don’t dredge now, he’s\r\ntoo old for that; it takes a man to be strong to dredge, so father goes\r\nto ship scrapin’. He on’y sits on a plank outside the ship, and scrapes\r\noff the old tar with a scraper. We does very well for all that--why he\r\ncan make his half a bull a day [2_s._ 6_d._] when he gits work, but\r\nthat’s not always; howsomever I helps the old man at times, when I’m\r\nable. I’ve found a good many bodies. I got a many rewards, and a tidy\r\nbit of inquest money. There’s 5_s._ 6_d._ inquest money at Rotherhithe,\r\nand on’y a shillin’ at Deptford; I can’t make out how that is, but\r\nthat’s all they give, I know. I never finds anythink on the bodies. Lor\r\nbless you! people don’t have anythink in their pockets when they gits\r\ndrowned, they are not such fools as all that. Do you see them two marks\r\nthere on the back of my hand? Well, one day--I was on’y young then--I\r\nwas grabblin’ for old rope in Church Hole, when I brings up a body, and\r\njust as I was fixing the rope on his leg to tow him ashore, two swells\r\ncomes down in a skiff, and lays hold of the painter of my boat, and\r\ntows me ashore. The hook of the drag went right thro’ the trowsers of\r\nthe drowned man and my hand, and I couldn’t let go no how, and tho’ I\r\nroared out like mad, the swells didn’t care, but dragged me into the\r\nstairs. When I got there, my arm, and the corpse’s shoe and trowsers,\r\nwas all kivered with my blood. What do you think the gents said?--why,\r\nthey told me as how they had done me good, in towin’ the body in, and\r\nran away up the stairs. Tho’ times ain’t near so good as they was, I\r\nmanages purty tidy, and hasn’t got no occasion to hollor much; but\r\nthere’s some of the dredgers as would hollor, if they was ever so well\r\noff.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SEWER-HUNTERS.\r\n\r\nSome few years ago, the main sewers, having their outlets on the river\r\nside, were completely open, so that any person desirous of exploring\r\ntheir dark and uninviting recesses might enter at the river side, and\r\nwander away, provided he could withstand the combination of villanous\r\nstenches which met him at every step, for many miles, in any direction.\r\nAt that time it was a thing of very frequent occurrence, especially\r\nat the spring tides, for the water to rush into the sewers, pouring\r\nthrough them like a torrent, and then to burst up through the gratings\r\ninto the streets, flooding all the low-lying districts in the vicinity\r\nof the river, till the streets of Shadwell and Wapping resembled a\r\nDutch town, intersected by a series of muddy canals. Of late, however,\r\nto remedy this defect, the Commissioners have had a strong brick wall\r\nbuilt within the entrance to the several sewers. In each of these brick\r\nwalls there is an opening covered by a strong iron door, which hangs\r\nfrom the top and is so arranged that when the tide is low the rush of\r\nthe water and other filth on the inner side, forces it back and allows\r\nthe contents of the sewer to pass into the river, whilst when the tide\r\nrises the door is forced so close against the wall by the pressure of\r\nthe water outside that none can by any possibility enter, and thus the\r\nriver neighbourhoods are secured from the deluges which were heretofore\r\nof such frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nWere it not a notorious fact, it might perhaps be thought impossible,\r\nthat men could be found who, for the chance of obtaining a living of\r\nsome sort or other, would, day after day, and year after year, continue\r\nto travel through these underground channels for the offscouring of\r\nthe city; but such is the case even at the present moment. In former\r\ntimes, however, this custom prevailed much more than now, for in those\r\ndays the sewers were entirely open and presented no obstacle to any\r\none desirous of entering them. Many wondrous tales are still told\r\namong the people of men having lost their way in the sewers, and of\r\nhaving wandered among the filthy passages--their lights extinguished\r\nby the noisome vapours--till, faint and overpowered, they dropped down\r\nand died on the spot. Other stories are told of sewer-hunters beset\r\nby myriads of enormous rats, and slaying thousands of them in their\r\nstruggle for life, till at length the swarms of the savage things\r\noverpowered them, and in a few days afterwards their skeletons were\r\ndiscovered picked to the very bones. Since the iron doors, however,\r\nhave been placed on the main sewers a prohibition has been issued\r\nagainst entering them, and a reward of 5_l._ offered to any person\r\ngiving information so as to lead to the conviction of any offender.\r\nNevertheless many still travel through these foul labyrinths, in search\r\nof such valuables as may have found their way down the drains.\r\n\r\nThe persons who are in the habit of searching the sewers, call\r\nthemselves “shore-men” or “shore-workers.” They belong, in a certain\r\ndegree, to the same class as the “mud-larks,” that is to say,\r\nthey travel through the mud along shore in the neighbourhood of\r\nship-building and ship-breaking yards, for the purpose of picking\r\nup copper nails, bolts, iron, and old rope. The shore-men, however,\r\ndo not collect the lumps of coal and wood they meet with on their\r\nway, but leave them as the proper perquisites of the mud-larks. The\r\nsewer-hunters were formerly, and indeed are still, called by the name\r\nof “Toshers,” the articles which they pick up in the course of their\r\nwanderings along shore being known among themselves by the general\r\nterm “tosh,” a word more particularly applied by them to anything made\r\nof copper. These “Toshers” may be seen, especially on the Surrey side\r\nof the Thames, habited in long greasy velveteen coats, furnished with\r\npockets of vast capacity, and their nether limbs encased in dirty\r\ncanvas trowsers, and any old slops of shoes, that may be fit only for\r\nwading through the mud. They carry a bag on their back, and in their\r\nhand a pole seven or eight feet long, on one end of which there is\r\na large iron hoe. The uses of this instrument are various; with it\r\nthey try the ground wherever it appears unsafe, before venturing on\r\nit, and, when assured of its safety, walk forward steadying their\r\nfootsteps with the staff. Should they, as often happens, even to the\r\nmost experienced, sink in some quagmire, they immediately throw out the\r\nlong pole armed with the hoe, which is always held uppermost for this\r\npurpose, and with it seizing hold of any object within their reach,\r\nare thereby enabled to draw themselves out; without the pole, however,\r\ntheir danger would be greater, for the more they struggled to extricate\r\nthemselves from such places, the deeper they would sink; and even with\r\nit, they might perish, I am told, in some part, if there were nobody\r\nat hand to render them assistance. Finally, they make use of this\r\npole to rake about the mud when searching for iron, copper, rope, and\r\nbones. They mostly exhibit great skill in discovering these things in\r\nunlikely places, and have a knowledge of the various sets of the tide,\r\ncalculated to carry articles to particular points, almost equal to the\r\ndredgermen themselves. Although they cannot “pick up” as much now as\r\nthey formerly did, they are still able to make what they call a fair\r\nliving, and can afford to look down with a species of aristocratic\r\ncontempt on the puny efforts of their less fortunate brethren the\r\n“mudlarks.”\r\n\r\nTo enter the sewers and explore them to any considerable distance is\r\nconsidered, even by those acquainted with what is termed “working\r\nthe shores,” an adventure of no small risk. There are a variety of\r\nperils to be encountered in such places. The brick-work in many\r\nparts--especially in the old sewers--has become rotten through the\r\ncontinual action of the putrefying matter and moisture, and parts have\r\nfallen down and choked up the passage with heaps of rubbish; over these\r\nobstructions, nevertheless, the sewer-hunters have to scramble “in\r\nthe best way they can.” In such parts they are careful not to touch\r\nthe brick-work over head, for the slightest tap might bring down an\r\navalanche of old bricks and earth, and severely injure them, if not\r\nbury them in the rubbish. Since the construction of the new sewers, the\r\nold ones are in general abandoned by the “hunters;” but in many places\r\nthe former channels cross and re-cross those recently constructed,\r\nand in the old sewers a person is very likely to lose his way. It is\r\ndangerous to venture far into any of the smaller sewers branching\r\noff from the main, for in this the “hunters” have to stoop low down\r\nin order to proceed; and, from the confined space, there are often\r\naccumulated in such places, large quantities of foul air, which, as\r\none of them stated, will “cause instantious death.” Moreover, far from\r\nthere being any romance in the tales told of the rats, these vermin are\r\nreally numerous and formidable in the sewers, and have been known, I am\r\nassured, to attack men when alone, and even sometimes when accompanied\r\nby others, with such fury that the people have escaped from them with\r\ndifficulty. They are particularly ferocious and dangerous, if they\r\nbe driven into some corner whence they cannot escape, when they will\r\nimmediately fly at any one that opposes their progress. I received a\r\nsimilar account to this from one of the London flushermen. There are\r\nmoreover, in some quarters, ditches or trenches which are filled as the\r\nwater rushes up the sewers with the tide; in these ditches the water is\r\nretained by a sluice, which is shut down at high tide, and lifted again\r\nat low tide, when it rushes down the sewers with all the violence of a\r\nmountain torrent, sweeping everything before it. If the sewer-hunter be\r\nnot close to some branch sewer, so that he can run into it, whenever\r\nthe opening of these sluices takes place, he must inevitably perish.\r\nThe trenches or water reservoirs for the cleansing of the sewers are\r\nchiefly on the south side of the river, and, as a proof of the great\r\ndanger to which the sewer-hunters are exposed in such cases, it may\r\nbe stated, that not very long ago, a sewer on the south side of the\r\nThames was opened to be repaired; a long ladder reached to the bottom\r\nof the sewer, down which the bricklayer’s labourer was going with a\r\nhod of bricks, when the rush of water from the sluice, struck the\r\nbottom of the ladder, and instantly swept away ladder, labourer, and\r\nall. The bricklayer fortunately was enjoying his “pint and pipe” at\r\na neighbouring public-house. The labourer was found by my informant,\r\na “shore-worker,” near the mouth of the sewer quite dead, battered,\r\nand disfigured in a frightful manner. There was likewise great danger\r\nin former times from the rising of the tide in the sewers, so that it\r\nwas necessary for the shore-men to have quitted them before the water\r\nhad got any height within the entrance. At present, however, this is\r\nobviated in those sewers where the main is furnished with an iron door\r\ntowards the river.\r\n\r\nThe shore-workers, when about to enter the sewers, provide themselves,\r\nin addition to the long hoe already described, with a canvas apron,\r\nwhich they tie round them, and a dark lantern similar to a policeman’s;\r\nthis they strap before them on their right breast, in such a manner\r\nthat on removing the shade, the bull’s-eye throws the light straight\r\nforward when they are in an erect position, and enables them to\r\nsee everything in advance of them for some distance; but when they\r\nstoop, it throws the light directly under them, so that they can then\r\ndistinctly see any object at their feet. The sewer-hunters usually\r\ngo in gangs of three or four for the sake of company, and in order\r\nthat they may be the better able to defend themselves from the rats.\r\nThe old hands who have been often up (and every gang endeavours to\r\ninclude at least one experienced person), travel a long distance, not\r\nonly through the main sewers, but also through many of the branches.\r\nWhenever the shore-men come near a street grating, they close their\r\nlanterns and watch their opportunity of gliding silently past\r\nunobserved, for otherwise a crowd might collect over head and intimate\r\nto the policeman on duty, that there were persons wandering in the\r\nsewers below. The shore-workers never take dogs with them, lest their\r\nbarking when hunting the rats might excite attention. As the men go\r\nalong they search the bottom of the sewer, raking away the mud with\r\ntheir hoe, and pick, from between the crevices of the brick-work,\r\nmoney, or anything else that may have lodged there. There are in many\r\nparts of the sewers holes where the brick-work has been worn away,\r\nand in these holes clusters of articles are found, which have been\r\nwashed into them from time to time, and perhaps been collecting there\r\nfor years; such as pieces of iron, nails, various scraps of metal,\r\ncoins of every description, all rusted into a mass like a rock, and\r\nweighing from a half hundred to two hundred weight altogether. These\r\n“conglomerates” of metal are too heavy for the men to take out of\r\nthe sewers, so that if unable to break them up, they are compelled\r\nto leave them behind; and there are very many such masses, I am\r\ninformed, lying in the sewers at this moment, of immense weight, and\r\ngrowing larger every day by continual additions. The shore-men find\r\ngreat quantities of money--of copper money especially; sometimes they\r\ndive their arm down to the elbow in the mud and filth and bring up\r\nshillings, sixpences, half-crowns, and occasionally half-sovereigns\r\nand sovereigns. They always find the coins standing edge uppermost\r\nbetween the bricks in the bottom, where the mortar has been worn away.\r\nThe sewer-hunters occasionally find plate, such as spoons, ladles,\r\nsilver-handled knives and forks, mugs and drinking cups, and now and\r\nthen articles of jewellery; but even while thus “in luck” as they call\r\nit, they do not omit to fill the bags on their backs with the more\r\ncumbrous articles they meet with--such as metals of every description,\r\nrope and bones. There is always a great quantity of these things to be\r\nmet with in the sewers, they being continually washed down from the\r\ncesspools and drains of the houses. When the sewer-hunters consider\r\nthey have searched long enough, or when they have found as much as they\r\ncan conveniently take away, the gang leave the sewers and, adjourning\r\nto the nearest of their homes, count out the money they have picked\r\nup, and proceed to dispose of the old metal, bones, rope, &c.; this\r\ndone, they then, as they term it, “whack” the whole lot; that is, they\r\ndivide it equally among all hands. At these divisions, I am assured,\r\nit frequently occurs that each member of the gang will realise from\r\n30_s._ to 2_l._--this at least _was_ a frequent occurrence some few\r\nyears ago. Of late, however, the shore-men are obliged to use far more\r\ncaution, as the police, and especially those connected with the river,\r\nwho are more on the alert, as well as many of the coal-merchants in the\r\nneighbourhood of the sewers, would give information if they saw any\r\nsuspicious persons approaching them.\r\n\r\nThe principal localities in which the shore-hunters reside\r\nare in Mint-square, Mint-street, and Kent-street, in the\r\nBorough--Snow’s-fields, Bermondsey--and that never-failing locality\r\nbetween the London Docks and Rosemary-lane which appears to be a\r\nconcentration of all the misery of the kingdom. There were known to be\r\na few years ago nearly 200 sewer-hunters, or “toshers,” and, incredible\r\nas it may appear, I have satisfied myself that, taking one week with\r\nanother, they could not be said to make much short of 2_l._ per week.\r\nTheir probable gains, I was told, were about 6_s._ per day all the year\r\nround. At this rate the property recovered from the sewers of London\r\nwould have amounted to no less than 20,000_l._ per annum, which would\r\nmake the amount of property lost down the drains of each house amount\r\nto 1_s._ 4_d._ a year. The shore-hunters of the present day greatly\r\ncomplain of the recent restrictions, and inveigh in no measured terms\r\nagainst the constituted authorities. “They won’t let us in to work the\r\nshores,” say they, “’cause there’s a little danger. They fears as how\r\nwe’ll get suffocated, at least they tells us so; but they don’t care if\r\nwe get starved! no, they doesn’t mind nothink about that.”\r\n\r\nIt is, however, more than suspected that these men find plenty of means\r\nto evade the vigilance of the sewer officials, and continue quietly to\r\nreap a considerable harvest, gathered whence it might otherwise have\r\nrotted in obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe sewer-hunters, strange as it may appear, are certainly smart\r\nfellows, and take decided precedence of all the other “finders” of\r\nLondon, whether by land or water, both on account of the greater amount\r\nof their earnings, and the skill and courage they manifest in the\r\npursuit of their dangerous employment. But like all who make a living\r\nas it were by a game of chance, plodding, carefulness, and saving\r\nhabits cannot be reckoned among their virtues; they are improvident,\r\neven to a proverb. With their gains, superior even to those of the\r\nbetter-paid artizans, and far beyond the amount received by many\r\nclerks, who have to maintain a “respectable appearance,” the shore-men\r\nmight, with but ordinary prudence, live well, have comfortable homes,\r\nand even be able to save sufficient to provide for themselves in\r\ntheir old age. Their practice, however, is directly the reverse. They\r\nno sooner make a “haul,” as they say, than they adjourn to some low\r\npublic-house in the neighbourhood, and seldom leave till empty pockets\r\nand hungry stomachs drive them forth to procure the means for a fresh\r\ndebauch. It is principally on this account that, despite their large\r\ngains, they are to be found located in the most wretched quarter of the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the sewer-hunters (passing much of their time\r\nin the midst of the noisome vapours generated by the sewers, the odour\r\nof which, escaping upwards from the gratings in the streets, is dreaded\r\nand shunned by all as something pestilential) would exhibit in their\r\npallid faces the unmistakable evidence of their unhealthy employment.\r\nBut this is far from the fact. Strange to say, the sewer-hunters are\r\nstrong, robust, and healthy men, generally florid in their complexion,\r\nwhile many of them know illness only by name. Some of the elder men,\r\nwho head the gangs when exploring the sewers, are between 60 and 80\r\nyears of age, and have followed the employment during their whole\r\nlives. The men appear to have a fixed belief that the odour of the\r\nsewers contributes in a variety of ways to their general health;\r\nnevertheless, they admit that accidents occasionally occur from the air\r\nin some places being fully impregnated with mephitic gas.\r\n\r\nI found one of these men, from whom I derived much information, and\r\nwho is really an active intelligent man, in a court off Rosemary-lane.\r\nAccess is gained to this court through a dark narrow entrance, scarcely\r\nwider than a doorway, running beneath the first floor of one of the\r\nhouses in the adjoining street. The court itself is about 50 yards\r\nlong, and not more than three yards wide, surrounded by lofty wooden\r\nhouses, with jutting abutments in many of the upper stories that\r\nalmost exclude the light, and give them the appearance of being about\r\nto tumble down upon the heads of the intruders. This court is densely\r\ninhabited; every room has its own family, more or less in number; and\r\nin many of them, I am assured, there are two families residing, the\r\nbetter to enable the one to whom the room is let to pay the rent. At\r\nthe time of my visit, which was in the evening, after the inmates had\r\nreturned from their various employments, some quarrel had arisen among\r\nthem. The court was so thronged with the friends of the contending\r\nindividuals and spectators of the fight that I was obliged to stand\r\nat the entrance, unable to force my way through the dense multitude,\r\nwhile labourers and street-folk with shaggy heads, and women with dirty\r\ncaps and fuzzy hair, thronged every window above, and peered down\r\nanxiously at the affray. There must have been some hundreds of people\r\ncollected there, and yet all were inhabitants of this very court, for\r\nthe noise of the quarrel had not yet reached the street. On wondering\r\nat the number, my informant, when the noise had ceased, explained the\r\nmatter as follows: “You see, sir, there’s more than 30 houses in this\r\nhere court, and there’s not less than eight rooms in every house; now\r\nthere’s nine or ten people in some of the rooms, I knows, but just say\r\nfour in every room, and calculate what that there comes to.” I did, and\r\nfound it, to my surprise, to be 960. “Well,” continued my informant,\r\nchuckling and rubbing his hands in evident delight at the result, “you\r\nmay as well just tack a couple a hundred on to the tail o’ them for\r\nmake-weight, as we’re not werry pertikler about a hundred or two one\r\nway or the other in these here places.”\r\n\r\nIn this court, up three flights of narrow stairs that creaked and\r\ntrembled at every footstep, and in an ill-furnished garret, dwelt the\r\nshore-worker--a man who, had he been careful, according to his own\r\naccount at least, might have money in the bank and be the proprietor of\r\nthe house in which he lived. The sewer-hunters, like the street-people,\r\nare all known by some peculiar nickname, derived chiefly from some\r\npersonal characteristic. It would be a waste of time to inquire for\r\nthem by their right names, even if you were acquainted with them, for\r\nnone else would know them, and no intelligence concerning them could\r\nbe obtained; while under the title of Lanky Bill, Long Tom, One-eyed\r\nGeorge, Short-armed Jack, they are known to every one.\r\n\r\nMy informant, who is also dignified with a title, or as he calls it\r\na “handle to his name,” gave me the following account of himself: “I\r\nwas born in Birmingham, but afore I recollects anythink, we came to\r\nLondon. The first thing I remembers is being down on the shore at\r\nCuckold’s P’int, when the tide was out and up to my knees in mud, and a\r\ngitting down deeper and deeper every minute till I was picked up by one\r\nof the shore-workers. I used to git down there every day, to look at\r\nthe ships and boats a sailing up and down; I’d niver be tired a looking\r\nat them at that time. At last father ’prenticed me to a blacksmith in\r\nBermondsey, _and then I couldn’t git down to the river when I liked,\r\nso I got to hate the forge and the fire, and blowing the bellows, and\r\ncouldn’t stand the confinement no how,--at last I cuts and runs_. After\r\nsome time they gits me back ag’in, but I cuts ag’in. I was determined\r\nnot to stand it. I wouldn’t go home for fear I’d be sent back, so I\r\ngoes down to Cuckold’s P’int and there I sits near half the day, when\r\nwho should I see but the old un as had picked me up out of the mud when\r\nI was a sinking. I tells him all about it, and he takes me home along\r\nwith hisself, and gits me a bag and an o, and takes me out next day,\r\nand shows me what to do, and shows me the dangerous places, and the\r\nplaces what are safe, and how to rake in the mud for rope, and bones,\r\nand iron, and that’s the way I comed to be a shore-worker. Lor’ bless\r\nyou, I’ve worked Cuckold’s P’int for more nor twenty year. I know\r\nplaces where you’d go over head and ears in the mud, and jist alongside\r\non ’em you may walk as safe as you can on this floor. But it don’t do\r\nfor a stranger to try it, he’d wery soon git in, and it’s not so easy\r\nto git out agin, I can tell you. I stay’d with the old un a long time,\r\nand we used to git lots o’ tin, specially when we’d go to work the\r\nsewers. I liked that well enough. I could git into small places where\r\nthe old un couldn’t, and when I’d got near the grating in the street,\r\nI’d search about in the bottom of the sewer; I’d put down my arm to my\r\nshoulder in the mud and bring up shillings and half-crowns, and lots\r\nof coppers, and plenty other things. I once found a silver jug as big\r\nas a quart pot, and often found spoons and knives and forks and every\r\nthing you can think of. Bless your heart the smells nothink; it’s a\r\nroughish smell at first, but nothink near so bad as you thinks, ’cause,\r\nyou see, there’s sich lots o’ water always a coming down the sewer,\r\nand the air gits in from the gratings, and that helps to sweeten it a\r\nbit. There’s some places, ’specially in the old sewers, where they say\r\nthere’s foul air, and they tells me the foul air ’ill cause instantious\r\ndeath, but I niver met with anythink of the kind, and I think if there\r\nwas sich a thing I should know somethink about it, for I’ve worked the\r\nsewers, off and on, for twenty year. When we comes to a narrow-place\r\nas we don’t know, we takes the candle out of the lantern and fastens\r\nit on the hend of the o, and then runs it up the sewer, and if the\r\nlight stays in, we knows as there a’n’t no danger. We used to go up\r\nthe city sewer at Blackfriars-bridge, but that’s stopped up now; it’s\r\nboarded across inside. The city wouldn’t let us up if they knew it,\r\n’cause of the danger, they say, but they don’t care if we hav’n’t got\r\nnothink to eat nor a place to put our heads in, while there’s plenty\r\nof money lying there and good for nobody. If you was caught up it and\r\nbrought afore the Lord Mayor, he’d give you fourteen days on it, as\r\nsafe as the bellows, so a good many on us now is afraid to wenture in.\r\nWe don’t wenture as we used to, but still it’s done at times. There’s\r\na many places as I knows on where the bricks has fallen down, and that\r\nthere’s dangerous; it’s so delaberated that if you touches it with your\r\nhead or with the hend of the o, it ’ill all come down atop o’ you. I’ve\r\noften seed as many as a hundred rats at once, and they’re woppers in\r\nthe sewers, I can tell you; them there water rats, too, is far more\r\nferociouser than any other rats, and they’d think nothink of tackling\r\na man, if they found they couldn’t get away no how, but if they can\r\nwhy they runs by and gits out o’ the road. I knows a chap as the rats\r\ntackled in the sewers; they bit him hawfully: you must ha’ heard on it;\r\nit was him as the watermen went in arter when they heard him a shouting\r\nas they was a rowin’ by. Only for the watermen the rats would ha’ done\r\nfor him, safe enough. Do you recollect hearing on the man as was found\r\nin the sewers about twelve year ago?--oh you must--the rats eat every\r\nbit of him, and left nothink but his bones. I knowed him well, he was a\r\nrig’lar shore-worker.\r\n\r\n“The rats is wery dangerous, that’s sartain, but we always goes three\r\nor four on us together, and the varmint’s too wide awake to tackle us\r\nthen, for they know they’d git off second best. You can go a long way\r\nin the sewers if you like; I don’t know how far. I niver was at the\r\nend on them myself, for a cove can’t stop in longer than six or seven\r\nhour, ’cause of the tide; you must be out before that’s up. There’s a\r\nmany branches on ivery side, but we don’t go into all; we go where we\r\nknow, and where we’re always sure to find somethink. I know a place\r\nnow where there’s more than two or three hundred weight of metal all\r\nrusted together, and plenty of money among it too; but it’s too heavy\r\nto carry it out, so it ’ill stop there I s’pose till the world comes\r\nto an end. I often brought out a piece of metal half a hundred in\r\nweight, and took it under the harch of the bridge, and broke it up with\r\na large stone to pick out the money. I’ve found sovereigns and half\r\nsovereigns over and over ag’in, and three on us has often cleared a\r\ncouple of pound apiece in one day out of the sewers. But we no sooner\r\ngot the money than the publican had it. I only wish I’d back all the\r\nmoney I’ve guv to the publican, and I wouldn’t care how the wind blew\r\nfor the rest of my life. I never thought about taking a hammer along\r\nwith me into the sewer, no; I never thought I’d want it. You can’t go\r\nin every day, the tides don’t answer, and they’re so pertikler now,\r\nfar more pertikler than formerly; if you was known to touch the traps,\r\nyou’d git hauled up afore the beak. It’s done for all that, and though\r\nthere _is_ so many eyes about. The “Johnnys” on the water are always\r\non the look out, and if they sees any on us about, we has to cut our\r\nlucky. We shore workers sometimes does very well other ways. When we\r\nhears of a fire anywheres, we goes and watches where they shoots the\r\nrubbish, and then we goes and sifts it over, and washes it afterwards,\r\nthen all the metal sinks to the bottom. The way we does it is this\r\nhere: we takes a barrel cut in half, and fills it with water, and then\r\nwe shovels in the siftings, and stirs ’em round and round and round\r\nwith a stick; then we throws out that water and puts in some fresh, and\r\nstirs that there round ag’in; arter some time the water gets clear,\r\nand every thing heavy’s fell to the bottom, and then we sees what it\r\nis and picks it out. I’ve made from a pound to thirty shilling a day,\r\nat that there work on lead alone. The time the Parliament Houses was\r\nburnt, the rubbish was shot in Hyde Park, and Long J---- and I goes\r\nto work it, and while we were at it, we didn’t make less nor three\r\npounds apiece a day; we found sovereigns and half sovereigns, and lots\r\nof silver half melted away, and jewellery, such as rings, and stones,\r\nand brooches; but we never got half paid for them. I found two sets\r\nof bracelets for a lady’s arms, and took ’em to a jeweller, and he\r\ntried them jist where the “great” heat had melted the catch away, and\r\nfound they was only metal double plated, or else he said as how he’d\r\ngive us thirty pounds for them; howsomever, we takes them down to a\r\nJew in Petticoat-lane, who used to buy things of us, and he gives us\r\n7_l._ 10_s._ for ’em. We found so many things, that at last Long J----\r\nand I got to quarrel about the “whacking;” there was cheatin’ a goin’\r\non; it wasn’t all fair and above board as it ought to be, so we gits\r\nto fightin’, and kicks up sich a jolly row, that they wouldn’t let us\r\nwork no more, and takes and buries the whole on the rubbish. There’s\r\nplenty o’ things under the ground along with it now, if anybody could\r\ngit at them. There was jist two loads o’ rubbish shot at one time in\r\nBishop Bonner’s-fields, which I worked by myself, and what do you think\r\nI made out of that there?--why I made 3_l._ 5_s._ The rubbish was got\r\nout of a cellar, what hadn’t been stirred for fifty year or more, so I\r\nthinks there ought to be somethink in it, and I keeps my eye on it, and\r\nwatches where it’s shot; then I turns to work, and the first thing I\r\ngits hold on is a chain, which I takes to be copper; it was so dirty,\r\nbut it turned out to be all solid goold, and I gets 1_l._ 5_s._ for it\r\nfrom the Jew; arter that I finds lots o’ coppers, and silver money, and\r\nmany things besides. _The reason I likes this sort of life is, ’cause\r\nI can sit down when I likes, and nobody can’t order me about. When I’m\r\nhard up, I knows as how I must work, and then I goes at it like sticks\r\na breaking_; and tho’ the times isn’t as they was, I can go now and\r\npick up my four or five bob a day, where another wouldn’t know how to\r\nget a brass farden.”\r\n\r\nThere is a strange tale in existence among the shore-workers, of\r\na race of wild hogs inhabiting the sewers in the neighbourhood of\r\nHampstead. The story runs, that a sow in young, by some accident got\r\ndown the sewer through an opening, and, wandering away from the spot,\r\nlittered and reared her offspring in the drain, feeding on the offal\r\nand garbage washed into it continually. Here, it is alleged, the breed\r\nmultiplied exceedingly, and have become almost as ferocious as they\r\nare numerous. This story, apocryphal as it seems, has nevertheless\r\nits believers, and it is ingeniously argued, that the reason why none\r\nof the subterranean animals have been able to make their way to the\r\nlight of day is, that they could only do so by reaching the mouth of\r\nthe sewer at the river-side, while, in order to arrive at that point,\r\nthey must necessarily encounter the Fleet ditch, which runs towards the\r\nriver with great rapidity, and as it is the obstinate nature of a pig\r\nto swim _against_ the stream, the wild hogs of the sewers invariably\r\nwork their way back to their original quarters, and are thus never to\r\nbe seen. What seems strange in the matter is, that the inhabitants\r\nof Hampstead never have been known to see any of these animals pass\r\nbeneath the gratings, nor to have been disturbed by their gruntings.\r\nThe reader of course can believe as much of the story as he pleases,\r\nand it is right to inform him that the sewer-hunters themselves have\r\nnever yet encountered any of the fabulous monsters of the Hampstead\r\nsewers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MUD-LARKS.\r\n\r\nThere is another class who may be termed river-finders, although their\r\noccupation is connected only with the shore; they are commonly known by\r\nthe name of “mud-larks,” from being compelled, in order to obtain the\r\narticles they seek, to wade sometimes up to their middle through the\r\nmud left on the shore by the retiring tide. These poor creatures are\r\ncertainly about the most deplorable in their appearance of any I have\r\nmet with in the course of my inquiries. They may be seen of all ages,\r\nfrom mere childhood to positive decrepitude, crawling among the barges\r\nat the various wharfs along the river; it cannot be said that they\r\nare clad in rags, for they are scarcely half covered by the tattered\r\nindescribable things that serve them for clothing; their bodies are\r\ngrimed with the foul soil of the river, and their torn garments\r\nstiffened up like boards with dirt of every possible description.\r\n\r\nAmong the mud-larks may be seen many old women, and it is indeed\r\npitiable to behold them, especially during the winter, bent nearly\r\ndouble with age and infirmity, paddling and groping among the wet mud\r\nfor small pieces of coal, chips of wood, or any sort of refuse washed\r\nup by the tide. These women always have with them an old basket or\r\nan old tin kettle, in which they put whatever they chance to find.\r\nIt usually takes them a whole tide to fill this receptacle, but when\r\nfilled, it is as much as the feeble old creatures are able to carry\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MUD-LARK.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe mud-larks generally live in some court or alley in the\r\nneighbourhood of the river, and, as the tide recedes, crowds of\r\nboys and little girls, some old men, and many old women, may be\r\nobserved loitering about the various stairs, watching eagerly for the\r\nopportunity to commence their labours. When the tide is sufficiently\r\nlow they scatter themselves along the shore, separating from each\r\nother, and soon disappear among the craft lying about in every\r\ndirection. This is the case on both sides of the river, as high up as\r\nthere is anything to be found, extending as far as Vauxhall-bridge,\r\nand as low down as Woolwich. The mud-larks themselves, however, know\r\nonly those who reside near them, and whom they are accustomed to meet\r\nin their daily pursuits; indeed, with but few exceptions, these people\r\nare dull, and apparently stupid; this is observable particularly among\r\nthe boys and girls, who, when engaged in searching the mud, hold but\r\nlittle converse one with another. The men and women may be passed and\r\nrepassed, but they notice no one; they never speak, but with a stolid\r\nlook of wretchedness they plash their way through the mire, their\r\nbodies bent down while they peer anxiously about, and occasionally\r\nstoop to pick up some paltry treasure that falls in their way.\r\n\r\nThe mud-larks collect whatever they happen to find, such as coals,\r\nbits of old-iron, rope, bones, and copper nails that drop from ships\r\nwhile lying or repairing along shore. Copper nails are the most\r\nvaluable of all the articles they find, but these they seldom obtain,\r\nas they are always driven from the neighbourhood of a ship while being\r\nnew-sheathed. Sometimes the younger and bolder mud-larks venture on\r\nsweeping some empty coal-barge, and one little fellow with whom I\r\nspoke, having been lately caught in the act of so doing, had to undergo\r\nfor the offence seven days’ imprisonment in the House of Correction:\r\nthis, he says, he liked much better than mud-larking, for while he\r\nstaid there he wore a coat and shoes and stockings, and though he had\r\nnot over much to eat, he certainly was never afraid of going to bed\r\nwithout anything at all--as he often had to do when at liberty. He\r\nthought he would try it on again in the winter, he told me, saying, it\r\nwould be so comfortable to have clothes and shoes and stockings then,\r\nand not be obliged to go into the cold wet mud of a morning.\r\n\r\nThe coals that the mud-larks find, they sell to the poor people of the\r\nneighbourhood at 1_d._ per pot, holding about 14 lbs. The iron and\r\nbones and rope and copper nails which they collect, they sell at the\r\nrag-shops. They dispose of the iron at 5 lbs. for 1_d._, the bones at\r\n3 lbs. a 1_d._, rope a 1/2_d._ per lb. wet, and 3/4_d._ per lb. dry,\r\nand copper nails at the rate of 4_d._ per lb. They occasionally pick up\r\ntools, such as saws and hammers; these they dispose of to the seamen\r\nfor biscuit and meat, and sometimes sell them at the rag-shops for a\r\nfew halfpence. In this manner they earn from 2-1/2_d._ to 8_d._ per\r\nday, but rarely the latter sum; their average gains may be estimated\r\nat about 3_d._ per day. The boys, after leaving the river, sometimes\r\nscrape their trousers, and frequent the cab-stands, and try to earn a\r\ntrifle by opening the cab-doors for those who enter them, or by holding\r\ngentlemen’s horses. Some of them go, in the evening, to a ragged\r\nschool, in the neighbourhood of which they live; more, as they say,\r\nbecause other boys go there, than from any desire to learn.\r\n\r\nAt one of the stairs in the neighbourhood of the pool, I collected\r\nabout a dozen of these unfortunate children; there was not one of\r\nthem over twelve years of age, and many of them were but six. It\r\nwould be almost impossible to describe the wretched group, so motley\r\nwas their appearance, so extraordinary their dress, and so stolid and\r\ninexpressive their countenances. Some carried baskets, filled with the\r\nproduce of their morning’s work, and others old tin kettles with iron\r\nhandles. Some, for want of these articles, had old hats filled with\r\nthe bones and coals they had picked up; and others, more needy still,\r\nhad actually taken the caps from their own heads, and filled them with\r\nwhat they had happened to find. The muddy slush was dripping from their\r\nclothes and utensils, and forming a puddle in which they stood. There\r\ndid not appear to be among the whole group as many filthy cotton rags\r\nto their backs as, when stitched together, would have been sufficient\r\nto form the material of one shirt. There were the remnants of one or\r\ntwo jackets among them, but so begrimed and tattered that it would\r\nhave been difficult to have determined either the original material\r\nor make of the garment. On questioning one, he said his father was\r\na coal-backer; he had been dead eight years; the boy was nine years\r\nold. His mother was alive; she went out charing and washing when she\r\ncould get any such work to do. She had 1_s._ a day when she could get\r\nemployment, but that was not often; he remembered once to have had\r\na pair of shoes, but it was a long time since. “It is very cold in\r\nwinter,” he said, “to stand in the mud without shoes,” but he did not\r\nmind it in summer. He had been three years mud-larking, and supposed he\r\nshould remain a mud-lark all his life. What else could he be? for there\r\nwas nothing else that he knew _how_ to do. Some days he earned 1_d._,\r\nand some days 4_d._; he never earned 8_d._ in one day, that would have\r\nbeen a “jolly lot of money.” He never found a saw or a hammer, he\r\n“only wished” he could, they would be glad to get hold of them at the\r\ndolly’s. He had been one month at school before he went mud-larking.\r\nSome time ago he had gone to the ragged-school; but he no longer went\r\nthere, for he forgot it. He could neither read nor write, and did not\r\nthink he could learn if he tried “ever so much.” He didn’t know what\r\nreligion his father and mother were, nor did know what religion meant.\r\nGod was God, he said. He had heard he was good, but didn’t know what\r\ngood he was to him. He thought he was a Christian, but he didn’t know\r\nwhat a Christian was. He had heard of Jesus Christ once, when he went\r\nto a Catholic chapel, but he never heard tell of who or what he was,\r\nand didn’t “particular care” about knowing. His father and mother were\r\nborn in Aberdeen, but he didn’t know where Aberdeen was. London was\r\nEngland, and England, he said, was in London, but he couldn’t tell in\r\nwhat part. He could not tell where he would go to when he died, and\r\ndidn’t believe any one could tell _that_. Prayers, he told me, were\r\nwhat people said to themselves at night. _He_ never said any, and\r\ndidn’t know any; his mother sometimes used to speak to him about them,\r\nbut he could never learn any. His mother didn’t go to church or to\r\nchapel, because she had no clothes. All the money he got he gave to\r\nhis mother, and she bought bread with it, and when they had no money\r\nthey lived the best way they could.\r\n\r\nSuch was the amount of intelligence manifested by this unfortunate\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nAnother was only seven years old. He stated that his father was a\r\nsailor who had been hurt on board ship, and been unable to go to sea\r\nfor the last two years. He had two brothers and a sister, one of them\r\nolder than himself; and his elder brother was a mud-lark like himself.\r\nThe two had been mud-larking more than a year; they went because they\r\nsaw other boys go, and knew that they got money for the things they\r\nfound. They were often hungry, and glad to do anything to get something\r\nto eat. Their father was not able to earn anything, and their mother\r\ncould get but little to do. They gave all the money they earned to\r\ntheir mother. They didn’t gamble, and play at pitch and toss when they\r\nhad got some money, but some of the big boys did on the Sunday, when\r\nthey didn’t go a mud-larking. He couldn’t tell why they did nothing on\r\na Sunday, “only they didn’t;” though sometimes they looked about to\r\nsee where the best place would be on the next day. He didn’t go to the\r\nragged school; he should like to know how to read a book, though he\r\ncouldn’t tell what good it would do him. He didn’t like mud larking,\r\nwould be glad of something else, but didn’t know anything else that he\r\ncould do.\r\n\r\nAnother of the boys was the son of a dock labourer,--casually employed.\r\nHe was between seven and eight years of age, and his sister, who was\r\nalso a mud-lark, formed one of the group. The mother of these two was\r\ndead, and there were three children younger than themselves.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the histories may easily be imagined, for there was a\r\npainful uniformity in the stories of all the children: they were either\r\nthe children of the very poor, who, by their own improvidence or some\r\noverwhelming calamity, had been reduced to the extremity of distress,\r\nor else they were orphans, and compelled from utter destitution to seek\r\nfor the means of appeasing their hunger in the mud of the river. That\r\nthe majority of this class are ignorant, and without even the rudiments\r\nof education, and that many of them from time to time are committed to\r\nprison for petty thefts, cannot be wondered at. Nor can it even excite\r\nour astonishment that, once within the walls of a prison, and finding\r\nhow much more comfortable it is than their previous condition, they\r\nshould return to it repeatedly. As for the females growing up under\r\nsuch circumstances, the worst may be anticipated of them; and in proof\r\nof this I have found, upon inquiry, that very many of the unfortunate\r\ncreatures who swell the tide of prostitution in Ratcliff-highway, and\r\nother low neighbourhoods in the East of London, have originally been\r\nmud-larks; and only remained at that occupation till such time as they\r\nwere capable of adopting the more easy and more lucrative life of the\r\nprostitute.\r\n\r\nAs to the numbers and earnings of the mud-larks, the following\r\ncalculations fall short of, rather than exceed, the truth. From\r\nExecution Dock to the lower part of Limehouse Hole, there are 14 stairs\r\nor landing-places, by which the mud-larks descend to the shore in order\r\nto pursue their employment. There are about as many on the opposite\r\nside of the water similarly frequented.\r\n\r\nAt King James’ Stairs, in Wapping Wall, which is nearly a central\r\nposition, from 40 to 50 mud-larks go down daily to the river; the\r\nmud-larks “using” the other stairs are not so numerous. If, therefore,\r\nwe reckon the number of stairs on both sides of the river at 28,\r\nand the average number of mud-larks frequenting them at 10 each, we\r\nshall have a total of 280. Each mud-lark, it has been shown, earns on\r\nan average 3_d._ a day, or 1_s._ 6_d._ per week; so that the annual\r\nearnings of each will be 3_l._ 18_s._, or say 4_l._, a year, and hence\r\nthe gross earnings of the 280 will amount to rather more than 1000_l._\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\nBut there are, in addition to the mud-larks employed in the\r\nneighbourhood of what may be called the pool, many others who work down\r\nthe river at various places as far as Blackwall, on the one side, and\r\nat Deptford, Greenwich, and Woolwich, on the other. These frequent the\r\nneighbourhoods of the various “yards” along shore, where vessels are\r\nbeing built; and whence, at certain times, chips, small pieces of wood,\r\nbits of iron, and copper nails, are washed out into the river. There\r\nis but little doubt that this portion of the class earn much more than\r\nthe mud-larks of the pool, seeing that they are especially convenient\r\nto the places where the iron vessels are constructed; so that the\r\npresumption is, that the number of mud-larks “at work” on the banks\r\nof the Thames (especially if we include those above bridge), and the\r\nvalue of the property extracted by them from the mud of the river, may\r\nbe fairly estimated at double that which is stated above, or say 550\r\ngaining 2000_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the doctrines I have endeavoured to enforce\r\nthroughout this publication, I cite the following history of one of the\r\nabove class. It may serve to teach those who are still sceptical as to\r\nthe degrading influence of circumstances upon the poor, that many of\r\nthe humbler classes, if placed in the same easy position as ourselves,\r\nwould become, perhaps, quite as “respectable” members of society.\r\n\r\nThe lad of whom I speak was discovered by me now nearly two years ago\r\n“mud-larking” on the banks of the river near the docks. He was a quick,\r\nintelligent little fellow, and had been at the business, he told me,\r\nabout three years. He had taken to mud-larking, he said, because his\r\nclothes were too bad for him to look for anything better. He worked\r\nevery day, with 20 or 30 boys, who might all be seen at daybreak with\r\ntheir trowsers tucked up, groping about, and picking out the pieces of\r\ncoal from the mud on the banks of the Thames. He went into the river\r\nup to his knees, and in searching the mud he often ran pieces of glass\r\nand long nails into his feet. When this was the case, he went home and\r\ndressed the wounds, but returned to the river-side directly, “for\r\nshould the tide come up,” he added, “without my having found something,\r\nwhy I must starve till next low tide.” In the very cold weather he and\r\nhis other shoeless companions used to stand in the hot water that ran\r\ndown the river side from some of the steam-factories, to warm their\r\nfrozen feet.\r\n\r\nAt first he found it difficult to keep his footing in the mud, and he\r\nhad known many beginners fall in. He came to my house, at my request,\r\nthe morning after my first meeting with him. It was the depth of\r\nwinter, and the poor little fellow was nearly destitute of clothing.\r\nHis trousers were worn away up to his knees, he had no shirt, and his\r\nlegs and feet (which were bare) were covered with chilblains. On being\r\nquestioned by me he gave the following account of his life:--\r\n\r\nHe was fourteen years old. He had two sisters, one fifteen and the\r\nother twelve years of age. His father had been dead nine years. The man\r\nhad been a coal-whipper, and, from getting his work from one of the\r\npublican employers in those days, had become a confirmed drunkard. When\r\nhe married he held a situation in a warehouse, where his wife managed\r\nthe first year to save 4_l._ 10_s._ out of her husband’s earnings;\r\nbut from the day he took to coal-whipping she had never saved one\r\nhalfpenny, indeed she and her children were often left to starve. The\r\nman (whilst in a state of intoxication) had fallen between two barges,\r\nand the injuries he received had been so severe that he had lingered in\r\na helpless state for three years before his death. After her husband’s\r\ndecease the poor woman’s neighbours subscribed 1_l._ 5_s._ for her;\r\nwith this sum she opened a greengrocer’s shop, and got on very well for\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy was nine years old his mother sent him to the Red Lion\r\nschool at Green-bank, near Old Gravel-lane, Ratcliffe-highway; she\r\npaid 1_d._ a week for his learning. He remained there for a year; then\r\nthe potato-rot came, and his mother lost upon all she bought. About\r\nthe same time two of her customers died 30_s._ in her debt; this loss,\r\ntogether with the potato-disease, completely ruined her, and the whole\r\nfamily had been in the greatest poverty from that period. Then she was\r\nobliged to take all her children from their school, that they might\r\nhelp to keep themselves as best they could. Her eldest girl sold fish\r\nin the streets, and the boy went to the river-side to “pick up” his\r\nliving. The change, however, was so great that shortly afterwards the\r\nlittle fellow lay ill eighteen weeks with the ague. As soon as the boy\r\nrecovered his mother and his two sisters were “taken bad” with a fever.\r\nThe poor woman went into the “Great House,” and the children were taken\r\nto the Fever Hospital. When the mother returned home she was too weak\r\nto work, and all she had to depend on was what her boy brought from the\r\nriver. They had nothing to eat and no money until the little fellow\r\nhad been down to the shore and picked up some coals, selling them for\r\na trifle. “And hard enough he had to work for what he got, poor boy,”\r\nsaid his mother to me on a future occasion, sobbing; “still he never\r\ncomplained, but was quite proud when he brought home enough for us to\r\nget a bit of meat with; and when he has sometimes seen me down-hearted,\r\nhe has clung round my neck, and assured me that one day God would see\r\nus cared for if I would put my trust in Him.” As soon as his mother was\r\nwell enough she sold fruit in the streets, or went out washing when she\r\ncould get a day’s work.\r\n\r\nThe lad suffered much from the pieces of broken glass in the mud. Some\r\nlittle time before I met with him he had run a copper nail into his\r\nfoot. This lamed him for three months, and his mother was obliged to\r\ncarry him on her back every morning to the doctor. As soon, however,\r\nas he could “hobble” (to use his mother’s own words) he went back to\r\nthe river, and often returned (after many hours’ hard work in the mud)\r\nwith only a few pieces of coal, not enough to sell even to get them a\r\nbit of bread. One evening, as he was warming his feet in the water that\r\nran from a steam factory, he heard some boys talking about the Ragged\r\nSchool in High-street, Wapping.\r\n\r\n“They was saying what they used to learn there,” added the boy. “They\r\nasked me to come along with them for it was great fun. They told me\r\nthat all the boys used to be laughing and making game of the master.\r\nThey said they used to put out the gas and chuck the slates all about.\r\nThey told me, too, that there was a good fire there, so I went to have\r\na warm and see what it was like. When I got there the master was very\r\nkind to me. They used to give us tea-parties, and to keep us quiet they\r\nused to show us the magic lantern. I soon got to like going there, and\r\nwent every night for six months. There was about 40 or 50 boys in the\r\nschool. The most of them was thieves, and they used to go thieving\r\nthe coals out of barges along shore, and cutting the ropes off ships,\r\nand going and selling it at the rag-shops. They used to get 3/4_d._ a\r\nlb. for the rope when dry, and 1/2_d._ when wet. Some used to steal\r\npudding out of shops and hand it to those outside, and the last boy\r\nit was handed to would go off with it. They used to steal bacon and\r\nbread sometimes as well. About half of the boys at the school was\r\nthieves. Some had work to do at ironmongers, lead-factories, engineers,\r\nsoap-boilers, and so on, and some had no work to do and was good boys\r\nstill. After we came out of school at nine o’clock at night, some of\r\nthe bad boys would go a thieving, perhaps half-a-dozen and from that\r\nto eight would go out in a gang together. There was one big boy of the\r\nname of C----; he was 18 years old, and is in prison now for stealing\r\nbacon; I think he is in the House of Correction. This C---- used to go\r\nout of school before any of us, and wait outside the door as the other\r\nboys came out. Then he would call the boys he wanted for his gangs on\r\none side, and tell them where to go and steal. He used to look out in\r\nthe daytime for shops where things could be ‘prigged,’ and at night he\r\nwould tell the boys to go to them. He was called the captain of the\r\ngangs. He had about three gangs altogether with him, and there were\r\nfrom six to eight boys in each gang. The boys used to bring what they\r\nstole to C----, and he used to share it with them. I belonged to one of\r\nthe gangs. There were six boys altogether in my gang; the biggest lad,\r\nthat knowed all about the thieving, was the captain of the gang I was\r\nin, and C---- was captain over him and over all of us.\r\n\r\n“There was two brothers of them; you seed them, sir, the night you\r\nfirst met me. The other boys, as was in my gang, was B---- B----, and\r\nB---- L----, and W---- B----, and a boy we used to call ‘Tim;’ these,\r\nwith myself, used to make up one of the gangs, and we all of us used\r\nto go a thieving every night after school-hours. When the tide would\r\nbe right up, and we had nothing to do along shore, we used to go\r\nthieving in the daytime as well. It was B---- B----, and B---- L----,\r\nas first put me up to go thieving; they took me with them, one night,\r\nup the lane [New Gravel-lane], and I see them take some bread out of a\r\nbaker’s, and they wasn’t found out; and, after that, I used to go with\r\nthem regular. Then I joined C----’s gang; and, after that, C---- came\r\nand told us that his gang could do better than ourn, and he asked us\r\nto join our gang to his’n, and we did so. Sometimes we used to make\r\n3_s._ or 4_s._ a day; or about 6_d._ apiece. While waiting outside the\r\nschool-doors, before they opened, we used to plan up where we would go\r\nthieving after school was over. I was taken up once for thieving coals\r\nmyself, but I was let go again.”\r\n\r\nI was so much struck with the boy’s truthfulness of manner, that I\r\nasked him, _would_, he really lead a different life, if he saw a\r\nmeans of so doing? He assured me he would, and begged me earnestly to\r\ntry him. Upon his leaving me, 2_s._ were given him for his trouble.\r\nThis small sum (I afterwards learned) kept the family for more than a\r\nfortnight. The girl laid it out in sprats (it being then winter-time);\r\nthese she sold in the streets.\r\n\r\nI mentioned the fact to a literary friend, who interested himself\r\nin the boy’s welfare; and eventually succeeded in procuring him a\r\nsituation at an eminent printer’s. The subjoined letter will show how\r\nthe lad conducted himself while there.\r\n\r\n  “Whitefriars, April 22, 1850.\r\n\r\n “Messrs. Bradbury and Evans beg to say that the boy J. C. has\r\n conducted himself in a very satisfactory manner since he has been in\r\n their employment.”\r\n\r\nThe same literary friend took the girl into his service. She is in a\r\nsituation still, though not in the same family.\r\n\r\nThe boy now holds a good situation at one of the daily newspaper\r\noffices. So well has he behaved himself, that, a few weeks since, his\r\nwages were increased from 6_s._ to 9_s._ per week. His mother (owing to\r\nthe boy’s exertions) has now a little shop, and is doing well.\r\n\r\nThis simple story requires no comments, and is narrated here in the\r\nhope that it may teach many to know how often the poor boys reared\r\nin the gutter are thieves, merely because society forbids them being\r\nhonest lads.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LONDON DUSTMEN, NIGHTMEN, SWEEPS, AND SCAVENGERS.\r\n\r\nThese men constitute a large body, and are a class who, all things\r\nconsidered, do their work silently and efficiently. Almost without the\r\ncognisance of the mass of the people, the refuse is removed from our\r\nstreets and houses; and London, as if in the care of a tidy housewife,\r\nis _always_ being cleaned. Great as are the faults and absurdities\r\nof many parts of our system of public cleansing, nevertheless, when\r\ncompared with the state of things in any continental capital, the\r\nsuperiority of the metropolis of Great Britain is indisputable.\r\n\r\nIn all this matter there is little merit to be attributed to the\r\nworkmen, except that they may be well drilled; for the majority of them\r\nare as much machines, apart from their animation, as are the cane and\r\nwhalebone made to cleanse the chimney, or the clumsy-looking machine\r\nwhich, in its progress, is a vehicular scavenger, sweeping as it goes.\r\n\r\nThese public cleansers are to be thus classified:--\r\n\r\n1. Dustmen, or those who empty and remove the collection of ashes,\r\nbones, vegetables, &c., deposited in the dust-bins, or other refuse\r\nreceptacles throughout the metropolis.\r\n\r\n2. Nightmen, or those who remove the contents of the cesspools.\r\n\r\n3. Sweeps, or those who remove the soot from the chimneys.\r\n\r\n4. Scavengers, or those who remove the dirt from the streets, roads,\r\nand markets.\r\n\r\nLet me, however, before proceeding further with the subject, lay\r\nbefore the reader the following important return as to the extent and\r\ncontents of this prodigious city: for this document I am indebted to\r\nthe Commissioners of Police, gentlemen from whom I have derived the\r\nmost valuable information since the commencement of my inquiries, and\r\nto whose courtesy and consideration I am anxious to acknowledge my many\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nRETURN SHOWING THE EXTENT, POPULATION, AND POLICE FORCE IN THE\r\nMETROPOLITAN POLICE DISTRICT AND THE CITY OF LONDON IN SEPTEMBER, 1850.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+------------+-------------\r\n                                           |    Metropolitan Police District[6].   |            |\r\n                                           +------------+-----------+--------------+  City of   |   Grand\r\n                                           |   Inner    |   Outer   |              | London[8]. |   Total.\r\n                                           |District[7].| District. |    Total.    |            |\r\n  -----------------------------------------+------------+-----------+--------------+------------+-------------\r\n  Area (in square miles)                   |         91 |    609-1/2|      700-1/2 |      1-3/4 |      702-1/4\r\n  Parishes                                 |         82 |    136    |      218     |     97     |      315\r\n  Streets, Roads, &c.

If, however, London be regarded as concentring within the\r\nInner Police District, then, adding the extent and contents of that\r\ndistrict to those of the City, as above detailed, we have the subjoined\r\nstatement as to the dimensions and inhabitants of the\r\n\r\n\r\n_Metropolis Proper._\r\n\r\n  Area                             92-3/4 square miles.\r\n  Parishes                            179\r\n  Length of street, roads, &c.       1750 miles.\r\n  Number of inhabited houses      305,525\r\n  Ditto uninhabited                12,255\r\n  Ditto being built                  4657\r\n  Population                    2,111,629\r\n  Police force                       5412\r\n\r\nBut if the extent of even this “inner district” be so vast as almost\r\nto overpower the mind with its magnitude--if its population be greater\r\nthan that of the entire kingdom of Hanover, and almost equal to that of\r\nthe republic of Switzerland--if its houses be so numerous that placed\r\nside by side they would form one continuous line of dwellings from its\r\ncentre to Moscow--if its streets and roads be nearly equal in length to\r\none quarter of the diameter of the earth itself,--what a task must the\r\ncleansing of such a bricken wilderness be, and yet, assuredly, though\r\nit be by far the greatest, it is at the same time by far the cleanest\r\ncity in the world.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the refuse of a large town is, perhaps, one of the\r\nmost important of social operations. Not only is it necessary for the\r\nwell-being of a vast aggregation of people that the ordure should be\r\nremoved from both within and around their dwellings as soon as it is\r\ngenerated, but nature, ever working in a circle and reproducing in the\r\nsame ratio as she destroys, has made this same ordure not only the\r\ncause of present disease when allowed to remain within the city, but\r\nthe means of future health and sustenance when removed to the fields.\r\n\r\nIn a leading article in the _Morning Chronicle_, written about two\r\nyears since, I said--\r\n\r\n“That man gets his bones from the rocks and his muscles from the\r\natmosphere, is beyond all doubt. The iron in his blood and the lime in\r\nhis teeth were originally in the soil. But these could not be in his\r\nbody unless they had previously formed part of his food. And yet we can\r\nneither live on air nor on stones. We cannot grow fat upon lime, and\r\niron is positively indigestible in our stomachs. It is by means of the\r\nvegetable creation alone that we are enabled to convert the mineral\r\ninto flesh and blood. The only apparent use of herbs and plants is to\r\nchange the inorganic earth, air, and water, into organic substances\r\nfitted for the nutrition of animals. The little lichen, which, by means\r\nof the oxalic acid that it secretes, decomposes the rocks to which it\r\nclings, and fits their lime for ‘assimilation’ with higher organisms,\r\nis, as it were, but the primitive bone-maker of the world. By what\r\nsubtle transmutation inorganic nature is changed into organic, and dead\r\ninert matter quickened with life, is far beyond us even to conjecture.\r\nSuffice it that an express apparatus is required for the process--a\r\nspecial mechanism to convert the ‘_crust_ of the earth,’ as it is\r\ncalled, into food for man and beast.\r\n\r\n“Now, in Nature everything moves in a circle--perpetually changing,\r\nand yet ever returning to the point whence it started. Our bodies are\r\ncontinually decomposing and recomposing--indeed, the very process of\r\nbreathing is but one of decomposition. As animals live on vegetables,\r\neven so is the refuse of the animal the vegetable’s food. The carbonic\r\nacid which comes from our lungs, and which is poison for us to inhale,\r\nis not only the vital air of plants, but positively their nutriment.\r\nWith the same wondrous economy that marks all creation, it has been\r\nordained that what is unfitted for the support of the superior\r\norganisms, is of all substances the best adapted to give strength and\r\nvigour to the inferior. That which we excrete as pollution to our\r\nsystem, they secrete as nourishment to theirs. Plants are not only\r\nNature’s scavengers but Nature’s purifiers. They remove the filth\r\nfrom the earth, as well as disinfect the atmosphere, and fit it to be\r\nbreathed by a higher order of beings. Without the vegetable creation\r\nthe animal could neither have been nor be. Plants not only fitted the\r\nearth originally for the residence of man and the brute, but to this\r\nday they continue to render it habitable to us. For this end their\r\nnature has been made the very antithesis to ours. The process by which\r\nwe live is the process by which they are destroyed. That which supports\r\nrespiration in us produces putrefaction in them. What our lungs throw\r\noff, their lungs absorb--what our bodies reject, their roots imbibe.\r\n\r\n“Hence, in order that the balance of waste and supply should be\r\nmaintained--that the principle of universal compensation should be kept\r\nup, and that what is rejected by us should go to the sustenance of\r\nplants, Nature has given us several instinctive motives to remove our\r\nrefuse from us. She has not only constituted that which we egest the\r\nmost loathsome of all things to our senses and imagination, but she has\r\nrendered its effluvium highly pernicious to our health--sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen being at once the most deleterious and offensive of all gases.\r\nConsequently, as in all other cases where the great law of Nature has\r\nto be enforced by special sanctions, a double motive has been given us\r\nto do that which it is necessary for us to do, and thus it has been\r\nmade not only advantageous to us to remove our refuse to the fields,\r\nbut positively detrimental to our health, and disgusting to our senses,\r\nto keep it in the neighbourhood of our houses.\r\n\r\n“In every well-regulated State, therefore, an effective and rapid\r\nmeans for carrying off the ordure of the people to a locality where\r\nit may be fruitful instead of destructive, becomes a most important\r\nconsideration. Both the health and the wealth of the nation depend upon\r\nit. If to make two blades of wheat grow where one grew before is to\r\nconfer a benefit on the world, surely to remove that which will enable\r\nus at once to do this, and to purify the very air which we breathe,\r\nas well as the water which we drink, must be a still greater boon\r\nto society. It is, in fact, to give the community not only a double\r\namount of food, but a double amount of health to enjoy it. We are now\r\nbeginning to understand this. Up to the present time we have only\r\nthought of removing our refuse--the idea of using it never entered our\r\nminds. It was not until science taught us the dependence of one order\r\nof creation upon another, that we began to see that what appeared worse\r\nthan worthless to us was Nature’s capital--_wealth set aside for future\r\nproduction_.”\r\n\r\nIn connection with this part of the subject, viz., the use of human\r\nrefuse, I would here draw attention to those erroneous notions, as\r\nto the multiplication of the people, which teach us to look upon the\r\nincrease of the population beyond certain limits as the greatest\r\npossible evil that can befall a community. Population, it is said,\r\nmultiplies itself in a geometrical ratio, whereas the produce of the\r\nland is increased only in arithmetical proportion; that is to say,\r\nwhile the people are augmented after the rate of--\r\n\r\n  2  4  8  16  32  64\r\n\r\nthe quantity of food for them can be extended only in the following\r\ndegrees:--\r\n\r\n  2  4  6  8  10  12\r\n\r\nThe cause of this is said to be that, after a certain stage in the\r\ncultivation of the soil, the increase of the produce from land is not\r\nin proportion to the increase of labour devoted to it; that is to say,\r\ndoubling the labour does not double the crop; and hence it is asserted\r\nthat the human race increasing at a quicker rate than the food,\r\ninsufficient sustenance must be the necessary lot of a portion of the\r\npeople in every densely-populated community.\r\n\r\nThat men of intelligence and education should have been persuaded by\r\nso plausible a doctrine at the time of its first promulgation may be\r\nreadily conceived, for then the notions concerning organic chemistry\r\nwere vague in the extreme, and the great universal law of Waste\r\nand Supply remained to be fully developed; but that men pretending\r\nto the least scientific knowledge should in these days be found\r\nadvocating the Population Theory is only another of the many proofs\r\nof the indisposition of even the strongest minds to abandon their pet\r\nprejudices. Assuredly Malthus and Liebig are incompatible. If the new\r\nnotions as to the chemistry of vegetation be true, then must the old\r\nnotions as to population be utterly unfounded. If what we excrete\r\nplants secrete--if what we exhale they inspire--if our refuse is their\r\nfood--then it follows that to increase the population is to increase\r\nthe quantity of manure, while to increase the manure is to augment\r\nthe food of plants, and consequently the plants themselves. If the\r\nplants nourish us, we at least nourish them. It seems never to have\r\noccurred to the economists that plants themselves required sustenance,\r\nand consequently they never troubled themselves to inquire whence they\r\nderived the elements of their growth. Had they done this they would\r\nnever have even expected that a double quantity of mere labour upon the\r\nsoil should have doubled the produce; but they would rather have seen\r\nthat it was utterly impossible for the produce to be doubled without\r\nthe food in the soil being doubled likewise; that is to say, they would\r\nhave perceived that plants could not, whatever the labour exerted upon\r\ntheir cultivation, extract the elements of their organization from the\r\nearth and air, unless those elements previously existed in the land and\r\natmosphere in which they grew, and that such elements, moreover, could\r\nnot exist there without some organic being to egest them.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of the universal Compensation extending throughout the\r\nmaterial world, and more especially through the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdom, is, perhaps, one of the grandest and most consoling that\r\nscience has yet revealed to us, making each mutually dependent on the\r\nother, and so contributing each to the other’s support. Moreover it is\r\nthe more comforting, as enabling us almost to demonstrate the falsity\r\nof a creed which is opposed to every generous impulse of our nature,\r\nand which is utterly irreconcilable with the attributes of the Creator.\r\n\r\n“Thanks to organic chemistry,” I said two years ago in the _Morning\r\nChronicle_, “we are beginning to wake up. Science has taught us that\r\nthe removal of the ordure of towns to the fields is a question that\r\nconcerns not only our health, but, what is a far more important\r\nconsideration with us, our breeches pockets. What we, in our ignorance,\r\nhad mistaken for refuse of the vilest kind, we have now learned to\r\nregard as being, with reference to its fertilizing virtues, ‘a precious\r\nore, running in rich veins beneath the surface of our streets.’\r\nWhereas, if allowed to reek and seethe in cesspools within scent of\r\nour very hearths, or to pollute the water that we use to quench our\r\nthirst and cook our food, it becomes, like all wealth badly applied,\r\nconverted into ‘poison:’ as Romeo says of gold to the apothecary--\r\n\r\n    ‘Doing more murders in this loathsome world\r\n    Than those poor compounds which thou mayst not sell.’\r\n\r\n“Formerly, in our eagerness to get rid of the pollution, we had\r\nliterally not looked beyond our noses: hence our only care was to carry\r\noff the nuisance from the immediate vicinity of our own residences.\r\nIt was no matter to us what became of it, so long as it did not taint\r\nthe atmosphere around us. This the very instincts of our nature had\r\nmade objectionable to us; so we laid down just as many drains and\r\nsewers as would carry our night-soil to the nearest stream; and thus,\r\ninstead of poisoning the air that we breathed, we poisoned the water\r\nthat we drank. Then, as the town extended--for cities, like mosaic\r\nwork, are put together piecemeal--street being dovetailed to street,\r\nlike county to county in our children’s geographical puzzles--each new\r\nrow of houses tailed on its drains to those of its neighbours, without\r\nany inquiry being made as to whether they were on the same level or\r\nnot. The consequence of this is, that the sewers in many parts of our\r\nmetropolis are subject to an ebb and flood like their central stream,\r\nso that the pollution which they remove at low-water, they regularly\r\nbring back at high-water to the very doors of the houses whence they\r\ncarried it.\r\n\r\n“According to the average of the returns, from 1841 to 1846, we\r\nare paying two millions every year for guano, bone-dust, and other\r\nforeign fertilizers of our soil. In 1845, we employed no fewer than\r\n683 ships to bring home 220,000 tons of animal manure from Ichaboe\r\nalone; and yet we are every day emptying into the Thames 115,000 tons\r\nof a substance which has been proved to be possessed of even greater\r\nfertilizing powers. With 200 tons of the sewage that we are wont to\r\nregard as refuse, applied to the irrigation of one acre of meadow\r\nland, seven crops, we are told, have been produced in the year, each\r\nof them worth from 6_l._ to 7_l._; so that, considering the produce to\r\nhave been doubled by these means, we have an increase of upwards of\r\n20_l._ per acre per annum effected by the application of that refuse\r\nto the surface of our fields. This return is at the rate of 10_l._\r\nfor every 100 tons of sewage; and, since the total amount of refuse\r\ndischarged into the Thames from the sewers of the metropolis is, in\r\nround numbers, 40,000,000 tons per annum, it follows that, according to\r\nsuch estimate, we are positively wasting 4,000,000_l._ of money every\r\nyear; or, rather, _it costs us that amount to poison the waters about\r\nus_. Or, granting that the fertilizing power of the metropolitan refuse\r\nis--as it is said to be--as great for arable as for pasture-lands,\r\nthen for every 200 tons of manure that we now cast away, we might have\r\nan increase of at least 20 bushels of corn per acre. Consequently\r\nthe entire 40,000,000 tons of sewage, if applied to fatten the land\r\ninstead of to poison the water, would, at such a rate of increase,\r\nswell our produce to the extent of 4,000,000 bushels of wheat per\r\nannum. Calculating then that each of these bushels would yield 16\r\nquartern loaves, it would follow that we fling into the Thames no less\r\nthan 246,000,000 lbs. of bread every year; or, still worse, by pouring\r\ninto the river that which, if spread upon our fields, would enable\r\nthousands to live, we convert the elements of life and health into the\r\ngerms of disease and death, changing into slow but certain poisons that\r\nwhich, in the subtle transmutation of organic nature, would become\r\nacres of life-sustaining grain.” I shall have more to say subsequently\r\non this waste and its consequences.\r\n\r\nThese considerations show how vastly important it is that in the best\r\nof all possible ways we should _collect_, _remove_, and _use_ the\r\nscavengery and excrementitious matter of our streets and houses.\r\n\r\nNow the removal of the refuse of London is no slight task, consisting,\r\nas it does, of the cleansing of 1750 miles of streets and roads; of\r\ncollecting the dust from 300,000 dust-bins; of emptying (according to\r\nthe returns of the Board of Health) the same number of cesspools, and\r\nsweeping near upon 3,000,000 chimneys.\r\n\r\nA task so vast it might naturally be imagined would give employment to\r\na number of hands, and yet, if we trusted the returns of the Occupation\r\nAbstract of 1841, the whole of these stupendous operations are\r\nperformed by a limited number of individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURN OF THE NUMBER OF SWEEPS, DUSTMEN, AND NIGHTMEN IN THE\r\nMETROPOLIS, ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS OF 1841.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n                          |      |        Males.        |       Females.\r\n                          |      +------------+---------+------------+---------\r\n                          |Total.|20 years and|         |20 years and|\r\n                          |      |  upwards.  |Under 20.|  upwards.  |Under 20.\r\n  ------------------------+------+------------+---------+------------+---------\r\n  Chimney Sweepers        | 1033 |     619    |   370   |     44     |\r\n  Scavengers and Nightmen |  254 |     227    |    10   |     17     |\r\n  ------------------------+------+------------+---------+------------+---------\r\n\r\nI am informed by persons in the trade that the “females” here\r\nmentioned as chimney-sweepers, and scavengers, and nightmen, must be\r\nsuch widows or daughters of sweeps and nightmen as have succeeded to\r\ntheir businesses, for that no women _work_ at such trades; excepting,\r\nperhaps, in the management and care of the soot, in assisting to empty\r\nand fill the bags. Many females, however, are employed in sifting dust,\r\nbut the calling of the dustman and dustwoman is not so much as noticed\r\nin the population returns.\r\n\r\nAccording to the occupation abstract of the previous decennial period,\r\nthe number of males of 20 years and upwards (for none others were\r\nmentioned) pursuing the same callings in the metropolis in 1831, were\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  Soot and chimney-sweepers   421\r\n  Nightmen and scavengers     130\r\n\r\nHence the increase in the adult male operatives belonging to these\r\ntrades, between 1831 and 1841, was, for Chimney-sweeps, 198; and\r\nScavengers and Nightmen, 97.\r\n\r\nBut these returns are preposterously incorrect. In the first place\r\nit was not until 1842 that the parliamentary enactment prohibiting\r\nthe further employment of climbing-boys for the purpose of sweeping\r\nchimneys came into operation. At that time the number of inhabited\r\nhouses in the metropolis was in round numbers 250,000, and calculating\r\nthese to have contained only eight rooms each, there would have been at\r\nthe least 2,000,000 chimneys to sweep. Now, according to the government\r\nreturns above cited--the London climbing-boys (for the masters did not\r\nand could not climb) in 1841 numbered only 370; at which rate there\r\nwould have been but one boy to no less than 5400 chimneys! Pursuing\r\nthe same mode of testing the validity of the “official” statements, we\r\nfind, as the nightmen generally work in gangs of four, that each of\r\nthe 63, or say 64, gangs comprised in the census returns, would have\r\nhad 4000 cesspools to empty of their contents; while, working both\r\nas scavengers and nightmen (for, according to the census, they were\r\nthe _only_ individuals following those occupations in London), they\r\nwould after their nocturnal labours have had about 27 miles of streets\r\nand roads to cleanse--a feat which would certainly have thrown the\r\nscavengering prowess of Hercules into the shade.\r\n\r\nUnder the respective heads of the dustmen, nightmen, sweeps, and\r\nscavengers, I shall give an account of the numbers, &c., employed, and\r\na resumé of the whole. It will be sufficient here to mention that my\r\ninvestigations lead to the conclusion that, of men working as dustmen\r\n(a portion of whom are employed as nightmen and scavengers) there are\r\nat present about 1800 in the metropolis. The census of 1841, as I have\r\npointed out, mentions no dustman whatever!\r\n\r\nBut I have so often had instances of the defects of this national\r\nnumbering of the people that I have long since ceased to place much\r\nfaith in its returns connected with the humbler grades of labour. The\r\ncostermongers, for example, I estimate at about 10,000, whereas the\r\ngovernment reports, as has been before mentioned, ignore the very\r\nexistence of such a class of people, and make the entire hawkers,\r\nhucksters, and pedlars of the metropolis to amount to no more than\r\n2045. Again, the London “coal labourers, heavers, and porters” are\r\nsaid, in the census of 1841, to be only 1700 in number; I find,\r\nhowever, that there are no less than 1800 “registered” coal-whippers,\r\nand as many coal porters; so that I am in no way inclined to give great\r\ncredence to the “official enumerations.” The difficulties which beset\r\nthe perfection of such a document are almost insuperable, and I have\r\nalready heard of returns for the forthcoming document, made by ignorant\r\npeople as to their occupations, which already go far to nullify the\r\nfacts in connection with the employment of the ignorant and profligate\r\nclasses of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this part of the subject, viz., the extent of surface,\r\nthe length of streets, and the number of houses throughout the\r\nmetropolis requiring to be continually cleansed of their refuse, as\r\nwell as the number of people as continually engaged in so cleansing\r\nthem, let me here append the last returns of the Registrar General,\r\ncopied from the census of 1851, as to the dimensions and contents of\r\nthe metropolis according to that functionary, so that they may be\r\ncompared with those of the metropolitan police before given.\r\n\r\nIn Weale’s “_London Exhibited_,” which is by far the most comprehensive\r\ndescription of the metropolis that I have seen, it is stated that it\r\nis “only possible to adopt a general idea of the giant city,” as its\r\nprecise boundaries and extent cannot be defined. On the north of the\r\nThames, we are told, London extends to Edmonton and Finchley; on the\r\nwest it stretches to Acton and Hammersmith; on the east it reaches\r\nLeyton and Ham; while on the south of the Thames the metropolis is said\r\nto embrace Wandsworth, Streatham, Lewisham, Woolwich, and Plumstead.\r\n“To each of these points,” says Mr. Weale, but upon what authority he\r\ndoes not inform us, “continuous streets of houses reach; but the solid\r\nmass of houses lies within narrow bounds--with these several long\r\narms extending from it. The greatest length of street, from east to\r\nwest,” he adds, “is about fourteen miles, and from north to south about\r\nthirteen miles. The solid mass is about seven miles by four miles, so\r\nthat the ground covered with houses is not less than 20 square miles.”\r\n\r\nMr. McCulloch, in his “_London in 1850-51_,” has a passage to the\r\nsame effect. He says, “The continued and rapid increase of buildings\r\nrenders it difficult to ascertain the extent of the metropolis at any\r\nparticular period. If we include in it those parts only that present\r\na solid mass of houses, its length from east to west may be taken at\r\nsix miles, and its breadth from north to south at about three miles\r\nand a half. There is, however, a nearly continuous line of houses\r\nfrom Blackwall to Chelsea, a distance of about seven miles, and from\r\nWalworth to Holloway, of four and a half miles. The extent of surface\r\ncovered by buildings is estimated at about sixteen square miles, or\r\nabove 10,000 acres, so that M. Say, the celebrated French economist,\r\ndid not really indulge in hyperbole when he said, ‘_Londres n’est plus\r\nune ville: c’est une province couverte de maisons!_’ (London is no\r\nlonger a town: it is a province covered with houses).”\r\n\r\nThe Government authorities, however, appear to have very different\r\nnotions from either of the above gentlemen as to the extent of the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nThe limits of London, as at present laid down by the Registrar General,\r\ninclude 176 parishes, besides several precincts, liberties, and\r\nextra-parochial places, comprising altogether about 115 square miles.\r\nAccording to the old bills of mortality, London formerly included only\r\n148 parishes, which were located as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Parishes within the walls of the city                97\r\n  Parishes without the walls                           17\r\n  Parishes in the city and liberties of Westminster    10\r\n  Out parishes in Middlesex and Surrey                 24\r\n                                                      ---\r\n                                                      148\r\n\r\nThe parishes which have been annexed to the above at different periods\r\nsince the commencement of the present century are:--\r\n\r\n  Parishes added by the late Mr. Rickman\r\n    (see Pop. Abstracts, 1801-31) (including\r\n    Chelsea, Kensington, Paddington, St.\r\n    Marylebone, and St. Pancras)                   5\r\n\r\n  Parishes added by the Registrar General,\r\n    1838 (including Hammersmith, Fulham,\r\n    Stoke Newington, Stratford-le-Bow, Bromley,\r\n    Camberwell, Deptford, Greenwich, and\r\n    Woolwich)                                     10\r\n\r\n  Parishes added by the Registrar General\r\n    in 1844 (including Clapham, Battersea,\r\n    Wandsworth, Putney, Lower Tooting, and\r\n    Streatham)                                     6\r\n\r\n  Parishes added by the Registrar General in\r\n    1846 (comprising Hampstead, Charlton,\r\n    Plumstead, Eltham, Lee, Kidbroke, and\r\n    Lewisham)                                      7\r\n                                                 ---\r\n  Total number of parishes in the metropolis,\r\n    as defined by the Registrar General          176\r\n\r\nThe extent of London, according to the limits assigned to it at the\r\nseveral periods above mentioned, was--\r\n\r\n                                Stat.

The four commonwealths, or\r\nkingdoms, of the Middle Saxons, East Saxons, the South Rick, and the\r\nKentwaras, once ruled over its surface. It now embraces the episcopal\r\ncities of London and Westminster, the towns of Woolwich, Deptford, and\r\nWandsworth, the watering places of Hampstead, Highgate, Islington,\r\nActon, and Kilburn, the fishing town of Barking, the once secluded and\r\nancient villages of Ham, Hornsey, Sydenham, Lee, Kensington, Fulham,\r\nLambeth, Clapham, Paddington, Hackney, Chelsea, Stoke Newington,\r\nNewington Butts, Plumstead, and many others.”\r\n\r\nThe 176 parishes now included by the Registrar General within the\r\nboundaries of the metropolis, are arranged by him into five districts,\r\nof which the

I have also computed the annual rate of\r\nincrease of the population from 1841-51, in the several localities\r\nhere mentioned, and append the result. It will be seen that, while\r\nwhat are popularly known as the suburbs have increased, both in houses\r\nand population, at a considerable rate, some of the more central parts\r\nof London, on the contrary, have decreased not only in the number of\r\npeople, but in the number of dwellings as well. This has been the case\r\nin St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, St. James’s, Westminster, St. Giles’s,\r\nand the City of London.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE INCREASE OF THE POPULATION AND INHABITED HOUSES,

7·6\r\n  --------------------------------+----------------+---------------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\nBy the above table we perceive that St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, St.\r\nJames’s, Westminster, St. Giles’s, the Strand, and the City have all\r\ndecreased both in population and houses since 1841. The population has\r\ndiminished most of all in St. James’s, and the houses the most in the\r\nCity. The suburban districts, however, such as Chelsea, Marylebone,\r\nSt. Pancras, Islington, Hackney, Shoreditch, Bethnal-green, Stepney,\r\nPoplar, Bermondsey, Newington, Lambeth, Wandsworth, Camberwell,\r\nGreenwich, and Lewisham, have all increased greatly within the last\r\nten years, both in dwellings and people. The greatest increase of the\r\npopulation, as well as houses, has been in Kensington, where the yearly\r\naddition has been 4500 people, and 630 houses.\r\n\r\nThe more densely-populated districts are, St. James’s, Westminster,\r\nSt. Giles’s, the Strand, Holborn, Clerkenwell, St. Luke, Whitechapel,\r\nand St. George’s-in-the-East, in all of which places there are upwards\r\nof 200 people to the acre, while in East and West London, in which\r\nthe population is the most dense of all, the number of people exceeds\r\n300 to the acre. The least densely populated districts are Hampstead,\r\nWandsworth, and Lewisham, where the people are not more than six, and\r\nas few as two to the acre.\r\n\r\nThe districts in which there are the greatest number of houses to\r\na given space, are St. James’s, Westminster, the Strand, Holborn,\r\nClerkenwell, St. Luke’s, Shoreditch, and St. George’s-in-the-East, in\r\nall of which localities there are upwards of 20 dwellings to each acre\r\nof ground, while in East and West London, which is the most closely\r\nbuilt over of all, the number of houses to each acre are as many as 32.\r\nHampstead and Lewisham appear to be the most open districts; for there\r\nthe houses are not more than eight and three to every ten acres of\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe localities in which the houses are the most crowded with inmates\r\nare the Strand and St. Giles’s, where there are more than eleven\r\npeople to each house, and St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, and St. James’s,\r\nWestminster, and Holborn, where each house has on an average ten\r\ninmates, while in Lewisham and Wandsworth the houses are the least\r\ncrowded, for there we find only five people to every house.\r\n\r\nNow, comparing this return with that of the metropolitan police,\r\nwe have the following results as to the extent and contents of the\r\nMetropolis Proper:--\r\n\r\n                              According\r\n                                 to            According\r\n                              Registrar     to Metropolitan\r\n                               General.         Police.\r\n  Area (in statute acres)        74,070          58,880\r\n  Parishes                          176             179\r\n  Number of inhabited houses    307,722         305,525\r\n  Population                  2,361,640       2,111,629\r\n\r\nHence it will be seen that both the extent and contents of these two\r\nreturns differ most materially.\r\n\r\n1st. The superficies of the Registrar General’s metropolis is very\r\nnearly 13 square miles, or 15,190 statute acres, greater than the\r\nmetropolis of the police commissioners.\r\n\r\n2nd. The number of inhabited houses is 2197 more in the one than in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n3rd. The population of London, according to the Registrar General’s\r\nlimits, is 250,011, or a quarter of a million, more than it is\r\naccording to the limits of the metropolitan police.\r\n\r\nIt were much to be desired that some more definite and scientific\r\nmode, not only of limiting, but of dividing the metropolis, were to be\r\nadopted. At present there are, perhaps, as many different metropolises,\r\nso to speak, and as many different modes of apportioning the several\r\nparts of the whole into districts, as there are public bodies whose\r\noperations are specially confined to the capital. The Registrar\r\nGeneral has, as we have seen, one metropolis divided into western,\r\nnorthern, central, eastern, and southern districts. The metropolitan\r\npolice commissioners have another metropolis apportioned into its A\r\ndivisions, B divisions, and so forth; and the Post Office has a third\r\nmetropolis parcelled out in a totally different manner; while the\r\nLondon City Mission, the Scripture Readers, the Ragged Schools, and the\r\nmany other similar metropolitan institutions, all seem to delight in\r\ncreating a distinct metropolis for themselves, thus tending to make the\r\nstatistical “confusion worse confounded.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DUSTMEN OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nDust and rubbish accumulate in houses from a variety of causes, but\r\nprincipally from the residuum of fires, the white ash and cinders, or\r\nsmall fragments of unconsumed coke, giving rise to by far the greater\r\nquantity. Some notion of the vast amount of this refuse annually\r\nproduced in London may be formed from the fact that the consumption of\r\ncoal in the metropolis is, according to the official returns, 3,500,000\r\ntons per annum, which is at the rate of a little more than 11 tons per\r\nhouse; the poorer families, it is true, do not burn more than 2 tons\r\nin the course of the year, but then many such families reside in the\r\nsame house, and hence the average will appear in no way excessive.\r\nNow the ashes and cinders arising from this enormous consumption of\r\ncoal would, it is evident, if allowed to lie scattered about in such a\r\nplace as London, render, ere long, not only the back streets, but even\r\nthe important thoroughfares, filthy and impassable. Upon the Officers\r\nof the various parishes, therefore, has devolved the duty of seeing\r\nthat the refuse of the fuel consumed throughout London is removed\r\nalmost as fast as produced; this they do by entering into an agreement\r\nfor the clearance of the “dust-bins” of the parishioners as often as\r\nrequired, with some person who possesses all necessary appliances for\r\nthe purpose--such as horses, carts, baskets, and shovels, together with\r\na plot of waste ground whereon to deposit the refuse. The persons with\r\nwhom this agreement is made are called “dust-contractors,” and are\r\ngenerally men of considerable wealth.\r\n\r\nThe collection of “dust,” is now, more properly speaking, the removal\r\nof it. The collection of an article implies the voluntary seeking\r\nafter it, and this the dustmen can hardly be said to do; for though\r\nthey parade the streets shouting for the dust as they go, they do so\r\nrather to fulfil a certain duty they have undertaken to perform than in\r\nany expectation of profit to be derived from the sale of the article.\r\n\r\nFormerly the custom was otherwise; but then, as will be seen hereafter,\r\nthe residuum of the London fuel was far more valuable. Not many\r\nyears ago it was the practice for the various master dustmen to send\r\nin their tenders to the vestry, on a certain day appointed for the\r\npurpose, offering to pay a considerable sum yearly to the parish\r\nauthorities for liberty to collect the dust from the several houses.\r\nThe sum formerly paid to the parish of Shadwell, for instance, though\r\nnot a very extensive one, amounted to between 400_l._ or 500_l._ per\r\nannum; but then there was an immense demand for the article, and the\r\ncontractors were unable to furnish a sufficient supply from London;\r\nships were frequently freighted with it from other parts, especially\r\nfrom Newcastle and the northern ports, and at that time it formed an\r\narticle of considerable international commerce--the price being from\r\n15_s._ to 1_l._ per chaldron. Of late years, however, the demand has\r\nfallen off greatly, while the supply has been progressively increasing,\r\nowing to the extension of the metropolis, so that the Contractors\r\nhave not only declined paying anything for liberty to collect it, but\r\nnow stipulate to receive a certain sum for the removal of it. It need\r\nhardly be stated that the parishes always employ the man who requires\r\nthe least money for the performance of what has now become a matter\r\nof duty rather than an object of desire. Some idea may be formed of\r\nthe change which has taken place in this business, from the fact, that\r\nthe aforesaid parish of Shadwell, which formerly received the sum\r\nof 450_l._ per annum for liberty to collect the dust, now pays the\r\nContractor the sum of 240_l._ per annum for its removal.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Sewers of the City of London, in 1846, through the\r\nadvice of Mr. Cochrane, the president of the National Philanthropic\r\nAssociation, were able to obtain from the contractors the sum of\r\n5000_l._ for liberty to clear away the dirt from the streets and the\r\ndust from the bins and houses in that district. The year following,\r\nhowever, the contractors entered into a combination, and came to a\r\nresolution not to bid so high for the privilege; the result was, that\r\nthey obtained their contracts at an expense of 2200_l._ By acting\r\non the same principle in the year after, they not only offered no\r\npremium whatever for the contract, but the City Commissioners of Sewers\r\nwere obliged to pay them the sum of 300_l._ for removing the refuse,\r\nand at present the amount paid by the City is as much as 4900_l._!\r\nThis is divided among four great contractors, and would, if equally\r\napportioned, give them 1250_l._ each.\r\n\r\nI subjoin a list of the names of the principal contractors and the\r\nparishes for which they are engaged:--\r\n\r\n  DISTRICTS CONTRACTED               NAMES OF\r\n          FOR.

Humphries.\r\n\r\nAll the metropolitan parishes now pay the contractors various amounts\r\nfor the removal of the dust, and I am credibly informed that there is\r\na system of underletting and jobbing in the dust contracts extensively\r\ncarried on. The contractor for a certain parish is often a different\r\nperson from the master doing the work, who is unknown in the contract.\r\nOccasionally the work would appear to be subdivided and underlet a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Pancras is split into no less than 21 districts, each\r\ndistrict having a separate and independent “Board,” who are generally\r\nat war with each other, and make separate contracts for their several\r\ndivisions. This is also the case in other large parishes, and these\r\nand other considerations confirm me in the conclusion that of large\r\nand small dust-contractors, job-masters, and middle-men, of one kind\r\nor the other, throughout the metropolis, there cannot be less than the\r\nnumber I have stated--90. With the exception of Bermondsey, there are\r\nno parishes who remove their own dust.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to arrive at any absolute statement as to the gross\r\namount paid by the different parishes for the removal of the entire\r\ndust of the metropolis. From Shadwell the contractor, as we have seen,\r\nreceives 250_l._; from the city the four contractors receive as much\r\nas 5000_l._; but there are many small parishes in London which do not\r\npay above a tithe of the last-mentioned sum. Let us, therefore, assume,\r\nthat one with another, the several metropolitan parishes pay 200_l._\r\na year each to the dust contractor. According to the returns before\r\ngiven, there are 176 parishes in London. Hence, the gross amount paid\r\nfor the removal of the entire dust of the metropolis will be between\r\n30,000_l._ and 40,000_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the dust throughout the metropolis, is, therefore,\r\ncarried on by a number of persons called Contractors, who undertake,\r\nas has been stated, for a certain sum, to cart away the refuse from\r\nthe houses as frequently as the inhabitants desire it. To ascertain\r\nthe precise numbers of these contractors is a task of much greater\r\ndifficulty than might at first be conceived.\r\n\r\nThe London Post Office Directory gives the following number of\r\ntradesmen connected with the removal of refuse from the houses and\r\nstreets of the metropolis.\r\n\r\n  Dustmen           9\r\n  Scavengers       10\r\n  Nightmen         14\r\n  Sweeps           32\r\n\r\nBut these numbers are obviously incomplete, for even a cursory\r\npassenger through London must have noticed a greater number of names\r\nupon the various dust carts to be met with in the streets than are here\r\nset down.\r\n\r\nA dust-contractor, who has been in the business upwards of 20 years,\r\nstated that, from his knowledge of the trade, he should suppose that at\r\npresent there might be about 80 or 90 contractors in the metropolis.\r\nNow, according to the returns before given, there are within the limits\r\nof the Metropolitan Police District 176 parishes, and comparing this\r\nwith my informant’s statement, that many persons contract for more than\r\none parish (of which, indeed, he himself is an instance), there remains\r\nbut little reason to doubt the correctness of his supposition--that\r\nthere are, in all, between 80 or 90 dust-contractors, large and small,\r\nconnected with the metropolis. Assuming the aggregate number to be 88,\r\nthere would be one contractor to every two parishes.\r\n\r\nThese dust-contractors are likewise the contractors for the\r\ncleansing of the streets, except where that duty is performed by the\r\nStreet-Orderlies; they are also the persons who undertake the emptying\r\nof the cesspools in their neighbourhood; the latter operation, however,\r\nis effected by an arrangement between themselves and the landlords\r\nof the premises, and forms no part of their parochial contracts. At\r\nthe office of the Street Orderlies in Leicester Square, they have\r\nknowledge of only 30 contractors connected with the metropolis; but\r\nthis is evidently defective, and refers to the “large masters” alone;\r\nleaving out of all consideration, as it does, the host of small\r\ncontractors scattered up and down the metropolis, who are able to\r\nemploy only two or three carts and six or seven men each; many of such\r\nsmall contractors being merely master sweeps who have managed to “get\r\non a little in the world,” and who are now able to contract, “in a\r\nsmall way,” for the removal of dust, street-sweepings, and night-soil.\r\nMoreover, many of even the “great contractors” being unwilling to\r\nventure upon an outlay of capital for carts, horses, &c., when their\r\ncontract is only for a year, and may pass at the end of that time into\r\nthe hands of any one who may underbid them--many such, I repeat, are\r\nin the habit of underletting a portion of their contract to others\r\npossessing the necessary appliances, or of entering into partnership\r\nwith them. The latter is the case in the parish of Shadwell, where a\r\nperson having carts and horses shares the profits with the original\r\ncontractor. The agreement made on such occasions is, of course, a\r\nsecret, though the practice is by no means uncommon; indeed, there is\r\nso much secrecy maintained concerning all matters connected with this\r\nbusiness, that the inquiry is beset with every possible difficulty.\r\nThe gentleman who communicated to me the amount paid by the parish\r\nof Shadwell, and who informed me, moreover, that parishes in his\r\nneighbourhood paid twice and three times more than Shadwell did, hinted\r\nto me the difficulties I should experience at the commencement of my\r\ninquiry, and I have certainly found his opinion correct to the letter.\r\nI have ascertained that in one yard intimidation was resorted to, and\r\nthe men were threatened with instant dismissal if they gave me any\r\ninformation but such as was calculated to mislead.\r\n\r\nI soon discovered, indeed, that it was impossible to place any reliance\r\non what some of the contractors said; and here I may repeat that the\r\nindisputable result of my inquiries has been to meet with far more\r\ndeception and equivocation from employers generally than from the\r\nemployed; working men have little or no motive for mis-stating their\r\nwages; they know well that the ordinary rates of remuneration for their\r\nlabour are easily ascertainable from other members of the trade, and\r\nseldom or never object to produce accounts of their earnings, whenever\r\nthey have been in the habit of keeping such things. With employers,\r\nhowever, the case is far different; to seek to ascertain from them\r\nthe profits of their trade is to meet with evasion and prevarication\r\nat every turn; they seem to feel that their gains are dishonestly\r\nlarge, and hence resort to every means to prevent them being made\r\npublic. That I have met with many honourable exceptions to this rule,\r\nI most cheerfully acknowledge; but that the _majority_ of tradesmen\r\nare neither so frank, communicative, nor truthful, as the men in their\r\nemploy, the whole of my investigations go to prove. I have already, in\r\nthe _Morning Chronicle_, recorded the character of my interviews with\r\nan eminent Jew slop-tailor, an army clothier, and an enterprising\r\nfree-trade stay-maker (a gentleman who subscribed his 100 guineas to\r\nthe League), and I must in candour confess that now, after two years’\r\nexperience, I have found the industrious poor a thousand-fold more\r\nveracious than the trading rich.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the amount of business done by these contractors, or\r\ngross quantity of dust collected by them in the course of the year,\r\nit would appear that each employs, on an average, about 20 men, which\r\nmakes the number of men employed as dustmen through the streets of\r\nLondon amount to 1800. This, as has been previously stated, is grossly\r\nat variance with the number given in the Census of 1841, which computes\r\nthe dustmen in the metropolis at only 254. But, as I said before, I\r\nhave long ceased to place confidence in the government returns on such\r\nsubjects. According to the above estimate of 254, and deducting from\r\nthis number the 88 master-dustmen, there would be only 166 labouring\r\nmen to empty the 300,000 dustbins of London, and as these men always\r\nwork in couples, it follows that every two dustmen would have to remove\r\nthe refuse from about 3600 houses; so that assuming each bin to require\r\nemptying once every six weeks they would have to cart away the dust\r\nfrom 2400 houses every month, or 600 every week, which is at the rate\r\nof 100 a day! and as each dust-bin contains about half a load, it would\r\nfollow that at this rate each cart would have to collect 50 loads of\r\ndust daily, whereas 5 loads is the average day’s work.\r\n\r\nComputing the London dust-contractors at 90, and the inhabited houses\r\nat 300,000, it follows that each contractor would have 3333 houses to\r\nremove the refuse from. Now it has been calculated that the ashes and\r\ncinders alone from each house average about three loads per annum, so\r\nthat each contractor would have, in round numbers, 10,000 loads of\r\ndust to remove in the course of the year. I find, from inquiries, that\r\nevery two dustmen carry to the yard about five loads a day, or about\r\n1500 loads in the course of the year, so that at this rate, there must\r\nbe between six and seven carts, and twelve and fourteen collectors\r\nemployed by each master. But this is exclusive of the men employed\r\nin the yards. In one yard that I visited there were fourteen people\r\nbusily employed. Six of these were women, who were occupied in sifting,\r\nand they were attended by three men who shovelled the dust into their\r\nsieves, and the foreman, who was hard at work loosening and dragging\r\ndown the dust from the heap, ready for the “fillers-in.” Besides these\r\nthere were two carts and four men engaged in conveying the sifted dust\r\nto the barges alongside the wharf. At a larger dust-yard, that formerly\r\nstood on the banks of the Regent’s-canal, I am informed that there were\r\nsometimes as many as 127 people at work. It is but a small yard, which\r\nhas not 30 to 40 labourers connected with it; and the lesser dust-yards\r\nhave generally from four to eight sifters, and six or seven carts.\r\nThere are, therefore, employed in a medium-sized yard twelve collectors\r\nor cartmen, six sifters, and three fillers-in, besides the foreman\r\nor forewoman, making altogether 22 persons; so that, computing the\r\ncontractors at 90, and allowing 20 men to be employed by each, there\r\nwould be 1800 men thus occupied in the metropolis, which appears to be\r\nvery near the truth.\r\n\r\nOne who has been all his life connected with the business estimated\r\nthat there must be about ten dustmen to each metropolitan parish, large\r\nand small. In Marylebone he believed there were eighteen dust-carts,\r\nwith two men to each, out every day; in some small parishes, however,\r\ntwo men are sufficient. There would be more men employed, he said,\r\nbut some masters contracted for two or three parishes, and so “kept\r\nthe same men going,” working them hard, and enlarging their regular\r\nrounds. Calculating, then, that ten men are employed to each of the 176\r\nmetropolitan parishes, we have 1760 dustmen in London. The suburban\r\nparishes, my informant told me, were as well “dustmaned” as any he\r\nknew; for the residents in such parts were more particular about their\r\ndust than in busier places.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how closely the number of men engaged in\r\nthe collection of the “dust” from the coals burnt in London agrees,\r\naccording to the above estimate, with the number of men engaged in\r\ndelivering the coals to be burnt. The coal-whippers, who “discharge the\r\ncolliers,” are about 1800, and the coal-porters, who carry the coals\r\nfrom the barges to the merchants’ wagons, are about the same in number.\r\nThe amount of residuum from coal after burning cannot, of course,\r\nbe equal either in bulk or weight to the original substance; but\r\nconsidering that the collection of the dust is a much slower operation\r\nthan the delivery of the coals, the difference is easily accounted for.\r\n\r\nWe may arrive, approximately, at the quantity of dust annually produced\r\nin London, in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nThe consumption of coal in London, per annum, is about 3,500,000 tons,\r\nexclusive of what is brought to the metropolis per rail. Coals are made\r\nup of the following component parts, viz. (1) the inorganic and fixed\r\nelements; that is to say, the ashes, or the bones, as it were, of the\r\nfossil trees, which cannot be burnt; (2) coke, or the residuary carbon,\r\nafter being deprived of the volatile matter; (3) the volatile matter\r\nitself given off during combustion in the form of flame and smoke.\r\n\r\nThe relative proportions of these materials in the various kinds of\r\ncoals are as follows.--\r\n\r\n                                    Carbon,    Volatile,    Ashes,\r\n                                   per cent.   per cent.   per cent.\r\n  Cannel or gas coals.              40 to 60    60 to 40      10\r\n  Newcastle or “house” coals.          57          37          5\r\n  Lancashire and Yorkshire coals.   50 to 60    35 to 40       4\r\n  South Welsh or “steam” coals.     81 to 85    11 to 15       3\r\n  Anthracite or “stone” coals.      80 to 95      None      a little.\r\n\r\nIn the metropolis the Newcastle coal is chiefly used, and this, we\r\nperceive, yields five per cent. ashes and about 57 per cent. carbon.\r\nBut a considerable part of the carbon is converted into carbonic acid\r\nduring combustion; if, therefore, we assume that two-thirds of the\r\ncarbon are thus consumed, and that the remaining third remains behind\r\nin the form of cinder, we shall have about 25 per cent. of “dust” from\r\nevery ton of coal. On inquiry of those who have had long experience in\r\nthis matter, I find that a ton of coal may be fairly said on an average\r\nto yield about one-fourth its weight in dust; hence the gross amount\r\nof “dust” annually produced in London would be 900,000 tons, or about\r\nthree tons per house per annum.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to obtain any definite statistics on this part of the\r\nsubject. Not one in every ten of the contractors keeps any account of\r\nthe amount that comes into the “yard.” An intelligent and communicative\r\ngentleman whom I consulted on this matter, could give me no information\r\non this subject that was in any way satisfactory. I have, however,\r\nendeavoured to check the preceding estimate in the following manner.\r\nThere are in London upwards of 300,000 inhabited houses, and each\r\nhouse furnishes a certain quota of dust to the general stock. I have\r\nascertained that an average-sized house will produce, in the course of\r\na year, about three cart-loads of dust, while each cart holds about\r\n40 bushels (baskets)--what the dustmen call a chaldron. There are, of\r\ncourse, many houses in the metropolis which furnish three and four\r\ntimes this amount of dust, but against these may be placed the vast\r\npreponderance of small and poor houses in London and the suburbs, where\r\nthere is not one quarter of the quantity produced, owing to the small\r\namount of fuel consumed. Estimating, then, the average annual quantity\r\nof dust from each house at three loads, or chaldrons, and the houses at\r\n300,000, it follows that the gross quantity collected throughout the\r\nmetropolis will be about 900,000 chaldrons per annum.\r\n\r\nThe next part of the subject is--what becomes of this vast quantity of\r\ndust--to what use it is applied.\r\n\r\nThe dust thus collected is used for two purposes, (1) as a manure for\r\nland of a peculiar quality; and (2) for making bricks. The fine portion\r\nof the house-dust called “soil,” and separated from the “brieze,” or\r\ncoarser portion, by sifting, is found to be peculiarly fitted for what\r\nis called breaking up a marshy heathy soil at its first cultivation,\r\nowing not only to the dry nature of the dust, but to its possessing in\r\nan eminent degree a highly separating quality, almost, if not quite,\r\nequal to sand. In former years the demand for this finer dust was very\r\ngreat, and barges were continually in the river waiting their turn to\r\nbe loaded with it for some distant part of the country. At that time\r\nthe contractors were unable to supply the demand, and easily got 1_l._\r\nper chaldron for as much as they could furnish, and then, as I have\r\nstated, many ships were in the habit of bringing cargoes of it from\r\nthe North, and of realizing a good profit on the transaction. Of late\r\nyears, however--and particularly, I am told, since the repeal of the\r\ncorn-laws--this branch of the business has dwindled to nothing. The\r\ncontractors say that the farmers do not cultivate their land now as\r\nthey used; it will not pay them, and instead, therefore, of bringing\r\nfresh land into tillage, and especially such as requires this sort\r\nof manure, they are laying down that which they previously had in\r\ncultivation, and turning it into pasture grounds. It is principally\r\non this account, say the contractors, that we cannot sell the dust we\r\ncollect so well or so readily as formerly. There are, however, some\r\ncargoes of the dust still taken, particularly to the lowlands in the\r\nneighbourhood of Barking, and such other places in the vicinity of the\r\nmetropolis as are enabled to realize a greater profit, by growing for\r\nthe London markets. Nevertheless, the contractors are obliged now to\r\ndispose of the dust at 2_s._ 6_d._ per chaldron, and sometimes less.\r\n\r\nThe finer dust is also used to mix with the clay for making bricks,\r\nand barge-loads are continually shipped off for this purpose. The\r\nfine ashes are added to the clay in the proportion of one-fifth ashes\r\nto four-fifths clay, or 60 chaldrons to 240 cubic yards, which is\r\nsufficient to make 100,000 bricks (where much sand is mixed with the\r\nclay a smaller proportion of ashes may be used). This quantity requires\r\nalso the addition of about 15 chaldrons, or, if mild, of about 12\r\nchaldrons of “brieze,” to aid the burning. The ashes are made to mix\r\nwith the clay by collecting it into a sort of reservoir fitted up for\r\nthe purpose; water in great quantities is let in upon it, and it is\r\nthen stirred till it resembles a fine thin paste, in which state the\r\ndust easily mingles with every part of it. In this condition it is left\r\ntill the water either soaks into the earth, or goes off by evaporation,\r\nwhen the bricks are moulded in the usual manner, the dust forming a\r\ncomponent part of them.\r\n\r\nThe ashes, or cindered matter, which are thus dispersed throughout the\r\nsubstance of the clay, become, in the process of burning, gradually\r\nignited and consumed. But the “brieze” (from the French _briser_, to\r\nbreak or crush), that is to say, the coarser portion of the coal-ash,\r\nis likewise used in the burning of the bricks. The small spaces left\r\namong the lowest courses of the bricks in the kiln, or “clamp,” are\r\nfilled with “brieze,” and a thick layer of the same material is spread\r\non the top of the kilns, when full. Frequently the “brieze” is mixed\r\nwith small coals, and after having been burnt the ashes are collected,\r\nand then mixed with the clay to form new bricks. The highest price at\r\npresent given for “brieze” is 3_s._ per ton.\r\n\r\nThe price of the dust used by the brickmakers has likewise been\r\nreduced; this the contractors account for by saying that there are\r\nfewer brick-fields than formerly near London, as they have been nearly\r\nall built over. They assert, that while the amount of dust and cinders\r\nhas increased proportionately to the increase of the houses, the demand\r\nfor the article has decreased in a like ratio; and that, moreover, the\r\ngreater portion of the bricks now used in London for the new buildings\r\ncome from other quarters. Such dust, however, as the contractors\r\nsell to the brick-makers, they in general undertake, for a certain\r\nsum, to cart to the brick-fields, though it often happens that the\r\nbrick-makers’ carts coming into town with their loads of bricks to new\r\nbuildings, call on their return at the dust-yards, and carry thence a\r\nload of dust or cinders back, and so save the price of cartage.\r\n\r\nBut during the operation of sifting the dust, many things are found\r\nwhich are useless for either manure or brick-making, such as oyster\r\nshells, old bricks, old boots and shoes, old tin kettles, old rags and\r\nbones, &c. These are used for various purposes.\r\n\r\nThe bricks, &c., are sold for sinking beneath foundations, where a\r\nthick layer of concrete is spread over them. Many old bricks, too, are\r\nused in making new roads, especially where the land is low and marshy.\r\nThe old tin goes to form the japanned fastenings for the corners of\r\ntrunks, as well as to other persons, who re-manufacture it into a\r\nvariety of articles. The old shoes are sold to the London shoemakers,\r\nwho use them as stuffing between the in-sole and the outer one; but by\r\nfar the greater quantity is sold to the manufacturers of Prussian blue,\r\nthat substance being formed out of refuse animal matter. The rags and\r\nbones are of course disposed of at the usual places--the marine-store\r\nshops.\r\n\r\nA dust-heap, therefore, may be briefly said to be composed of the\r\nfollowing things, which are severally applied to the following uses:--\r\n\r\n1. “Soil,” or fine dust, sold to brickmakers for making bricks, and to\r\nfarmers for manure, especially for clover.\r\n\r\n2. “Brieze,” or cinders, sold to brickmakers, for burning bricks.\r\n\r\n3. Rags, bones, and old metal, sold to marine-store dealers.\r\n\r\n4. Old tin and iron vessels, sold for “clamps” to trunks, &c., and for\r\nmaking copperas.\r\n\r\n5. Old bricks and oyster shells, sold to builders, for sinking\r\nfoundations, and forming roads.\r\n\r\n6. Old boots and shoes, sold to Prussian-blue manufacturers.\r\n\r\n7. Money and jewellery, kept, or sold to Jews.\r\n\r\nThe dust-yards, or places where the dust is collected and sifted, are\r\ngenerally situated in the suburbs, and they may be found all round\r\nLondon, sometimes occupying open spaces adjoining back streets and\r\nlanes, and surrounded by the low mean houses of the poor; frequently,\r\nhowever, they cover a large extent of ground in the fields, and\r\nthere the dust is piled up to a great height in a conical heap, and\r\nhaving much the appearance of a volcanic mountain. The reason why\r\nthe dust-heaps are confined principally to the suburbs is, that more\r\nspace is to be found in the outskirts than in a thickly-peopled and\r\ncentral locality. Moreover, the fear of indictments for nuisance has\r\nhad considerable influence in the matter, for it was not unusual for\r\nthe yards in former times, to be located within the boundaries of\r\nthe city. They are now, however, scattered round London, and always\r\nplaced as near as possible to the river, or to some canal communicating\r\ntherewith. In St. George’s, Shadwell, Ratcliffe, Limehouse, Poplar,\r\nand Blackwall, on the north side of the Thames, and in Redriffe,\r\nBermondsey, and Rotherhithe, on the south, they are to be found near\r\nthe Thames. The object of this is, that by far the greater quantity of\r\nthe soil or ashes is conveyed in sailing-barges, holding from 70 to\r\n100 tons each, to Feversham, Sittingbourne, and other places in Kent,\r\nwhich are the great brick-making manufactories for London. These barges\r\ncome up invariably loaded with bricks, and take home in return a cargo\r\nof soil. Other dust-yards are situated contiguous to the Regent’s\r\nand the Surrey canal; and for the same reason as above stated--for\r\nthe convenience of water carriage. Moreover, adjoining the Limehouse\r\ncut, which is a branch of the Lea River, other dust-yards may be\r\nfound; and again travelling to the opposite end of the metropolis, we\r\ndiscover them not only at Paddington on the banks of the canal, but at\r\nMaiden-lane in a similar position. Some time since there was an immense\r\ndust-heap in the neighbourhood of Gray’s-inn-lane, which sold for\r\n20,000_l._; but that was in the days when 15_s._ and 1_l._ per chaldron\r\ncould easily be procured for the dust. According to the present rate,\r\nnot a tithe of that amount could have been realized upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF A DUST YARD.\r\n\r\n(_From a Sketch taken on the spot._)]\r\n\r\nA visit to any of the large metropolitan dust-yards is far from\r\nuninteresting. Near the centre of the yard rises the highest heap,\r\ncomposed of what is called the “soil,” or finer portion of the dust\r\nused for manure. Around this heap are numerous lesser heaps, consisting\r\nof the mixed dust and rubbish carted in and shot down previous to\r\nsifting. Among these heaps are many women and old men with sieves\r\nmade of iron, all busily engaged in separating the “brieze” from the\r\n“soil.” There is likewise another large heap in some other part of the\r\nyard, composed of the cinders or “brieze” waiting to be shipped off to\r\nthe brickfields. The whole yard seems alive, some sifting and others\r\nshovelling the sifted soil on to the heap, while every now and then\r\nthe dust-carts return to discharge their loads, and proceed again on\r\ntheir rounds for a fresh supply. Cocks and hens keep up a continual\r\nscratching and cackling among the heaps, and numerous pigs seem to find\r\ngreat delight in rooting incessantly about after the garbage and offal\r\ncollected from the houses and markets.\r\n\r\nIn a dust-yard lately visited the sifters formed a curious sight;\r\nthey were almost up to their middle in dust, ranged in a semi-circle\r\nin front of that part of the heap which was being “worked;” each had\r\nbefore her a small mound of soil which had fallen through her sieve and\r\nformed a sort of embankment, behind which she stood. The appearance of\r\nthe entire group at their work was most peculiar. Their coarse dirty\r\ncotton gowns were tucked up behind them, their arms were bared above\r\ntheir elbows, their black bonnets crushed and battered like those\r\nof fish-women; over their gowns they wore a strong leathern apron,\r\nextending from their necks to the extremities of their petticoats,\r\nwhile over this, again, was another leathern apron, shorter, thickly\r\npadded, and fastened by a stout string or strap round the waist. In the\r\nprocess of their work they pushed the sieve from them and drew it back\r\nagain with apparent violence, striking it against the outer leathern\r\napron with such force that it produced each time a hollow sound, like\r\na blow on the tenor drum. All the women present were middle aged,\r\nwith the exception of one who was very old--68 years of age she told\r\nme--and had been at the business from a girl. She was the daughter of\r\na dustman, the wife, or woman of a dustman, and the mother of several\r\nyoung dustmen--sons and grandsons--all at work at the dust-yards at the\r\neast end of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nWe now come to speak of the labourers engaged in collecting, sifting,\r\nor shipping off the dust of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe dustmen, scavengers, and nightmen are, to a certain extent, the\r\nsame people. The contractors generally agree with the various parishes\r\nto remove both the dust from the houses and the mud from the streets;\r\nthe men in their employ are indiscriminately engaged in these two\r\ndiverse occupations, collecting the dust to-day, and often cleansing\r\nthe streets on the morrow, and are designated either dustmen or\r\nscavengers, according to their particular avocation at the moment. The\r\ncase is somewhat different, however, with respect to the nightmen.\r\nThere is no such thing as a contract with the parish for removing the\r\nnightsoil. This is done by private agreement with the landlord of the\r\npremises whence the soil has to be removed. When a cesspool requires\r\nemptying, the occupying tenant communicates with the landlord, who\r\nmakes an arrangement with a dust-contractor or sweep-nightman for\r\nthis purpose. This operation is totally distinct from the regular\r\nor daily labour of the dust-contractor’s men, who receive extra pay\r\nfor it; sometimes one set go out at night and sometimes another,\r\naccording either to the selection of the master or the inclination of\r\nthe men. There are, however, some dustmen who have never been at work\r\nas nightmen, and could not be induced to do so, from an invincible\r\nantipathy to the employment; still, such instances are few, for the men\r\ngenerally go whenever they can, and occasionally engage in nightwork\r\nfor employers unconnected with their masters. It is calculated that\r\nthere are some hundreds of men employed nightly in the removal of the\r\nnightsoil of the metropolis during the summer and autumn, and as these\r\nmen have often to work at dust-collecting or cleansing the streets on\r\nthe following day, it is evident that the same persons cannot be thus\r\nemployed every night; accordingly the ordinary practice is for the\r\ndustmen to “take it in turns,” thus allowing each set to be employed\r\nevery third night, and to have two nights’ rest in the interim.\r\n\r\nThe men, therefore, who collect the dust on one day may be cleaning the\r\nstreets on the next, especially during wet weather, and engaged at\r\nnight, perhaps, twice during the week, in removing nightsoil; so that\r\nit is difficult to arrive at any precise notion as to the number of\r\npersons engaged in any one of these branches _per se_.\r\n\r\nBut these labourers not only work indiscriminately at the collection of\r\ndust, the cleansing of the streets, or the removal of nightsoil, but\r\nthey are employed almost as indiscriminately at the various branches\r\nof the dust business; with this qualification, however, that few men\r\napply themselves continuously to any one branch of the business. The\r\nlabourers employed in a dust-yard may be divided into two classes:\r\nthose paid by the contractor; and those paid by the foreman or\r\nforewoman of the dust-heap, commonly called hill-man or hill-woman.\r\n\r\nThey are as follows:--\r\n\r\n I. LABOURERS PAID BY THE CONTRACTORS, OR,\r\n\r\n   1. _Yard foreman_, or superintendent. This duty is often performed by\r\n   the master, especially in small contracts.\r\n\r\n   2. _Gangers_ or _dust-collectors_. These are called “fillers” and\r\n   “carriers,” from the practice of one of the men who go out with the\r\n   cart filling the basket, and the other carrying it on his shoulder to\r\n   the vehicle.\r\n\r\n   3. _Loaders_ of carts in the dust-yard for shipment.\r\n\r\n   4. _Carriers_ of cinders to the cinder-heap, or bricks to the\r\n   brick-heap.\r\n\r\n   5. _Foreman_ or _forewoman_ of the heap.\r\n\r\n II. LABOURERS PAID BY THE HILL-MAN OR HILL-WOMAN.\r\n\r\n   1. _Sifters_, who are generally women, and mostly the wives or\r\n   concubines of the dustmen, but sometimes the wives of badly-paid\r\n   labourers.\r\n\r\n   2. _Fillers-in_, or shovellers of dust into the sieves of the sifters\r\n   (one man being allowed to every two or three women).\r\n\r\n   3. _Carriers off_ of bones, rags, metal, and other perquisites to the\r\n   various heaps; these are mostly children of the dustmen.\r\n\r\nA medium-sized dust-yard will employ about twelve collectors, three\r\nfillers-in, six sifters, and one foreman or forewoman; while a large\r\nyard will afford work to about 150 people.\r\n\r\nThere are four different modes of payment prevalent among the several\r\nlabourers employed at the metropolitan dust-yards:--(1) by the day; (2)\r\nby the piece or load; (3) by the lump; (4) by perquisites.\r\n\r\n1st. The foreman of the yard, where the master does not perform this\r\nduty himself, is generally one of the regular dustmen picked out by\r\nthe master, for this purpose. He is paid, the sum of 2_s._ 6_d._ per\r\nday, or 15_s._ per week. In large yards there are sometimes two and\r\neven three yard-foremen at the same rate of wages. Their duty is\r\nmerely to superintend the work. They do not labour themselves, and\r\ntheir exemption in this respect is considered, and indeed looked on by\r\nthemselves, as a sort of premium for good services.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LONDON DUSTMAN.\r\n\r\nDUST HOI! DUST HOI!\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\n2nd. The gangers or collectors are generally paid 8_d._ per load for\r\nevery load they bring into the yard. This is, of course, piece work,\r\nfor the more hours the men work the more loads will they be enabled to\r\nbring, and the more pay will they receive. There are some yards where\r\nthe carters get only 6_d._ per load, as, for instance, at Paddington.\r\nThe Paddington men, however, are not considered inferior workmen to\r\nthe rest of their fellows, but merely to be worse paid. In 1826, or\r\n25 years ago, the carters had 1_s._ 6_d._ per load; but at that time\r\nthe contractors were able to get 1_l._ per chaldron for the soil and\r\n“brieze” or cinders; then it began to fall in value, and according\r\nto the decrease in the price of these commodities, so have the wages\r\nof the dust-collectors been reduced. It will be at once seen that\r\nthe reduction in the wages of the dustmen bears no proportion to the\r\nreduction in the price of soil and cinders, but it must be borne in\r\nmind that whereas the contractors formerly paid large sums for liberty\r\nto collect the dust, they now are paid large sums to remove it. This\r\nin some measure helps to account for the apparent disproportion, and\r\ntends, perhaps, to equalize the matter. The gangers, therefore, have\r\n4_d._ each, per load when best paid. They consider from four to six\r\nloads a good day’s work, for where the contract is large, extending\r\nover several parishes, they often have to travel a long way for a\r\nload. It thus happens that while the men employed by the Whitechapel\r\ncontractor can, when doing their utmost, manage to bring only four\r\nloads a day to the yard, which is situated in a place called the\r\n“ruins” in Lower Shadwell, the men employed by the Shadwell contractor\r\ncan easily get eight or nine loads in a day. Five loads are about an\r\naverage day’s work, and this gives them 1_s._ 8-1/2_d._ per day each,\r\nor 10_s._ per week. In addition to this, the men have their perquisites\r\n“in aid of wages.” The collectors are in the habit of getting beer or\r\nmoney in lieu thereof, at nearly all the houses from which they remove\r\nthe dust, the public being thus in a manner compelled to make up the\r\nrate of wages, which should be paid by the employer, so that what is\r\ngiven to benefit the men really goes to the master, who invariably\r\nreduces the wages to the precise amount of the perquisites obtained.\r\nThis is the main evil of the “perquisite system of payment” (a system\r\nof which the mode of paying waiters may be taken as the special type).\r\nAs an instance of the injurious effects of this mode of payment in\r\nconnection with the London dustmen, the collectors are forced, as it\r\nwere, to extort from the public that portion of their fair earnings of\r\nwhich their master deprives them; hence, how can we wonder that they\r\nmake it a rule when they receive neither beer nor money from a house to\r\nmake as great a mess as possible the next time they come, scattering\r\nthe dust and cinders about in such a manner, that, sooner than have\r\nany trouble with them, people mostly give them what they look for?\r\nOne of the most intelligent men with whom I have spoken, gave me the\r\nfollowing account of his perquisites for the last week, viz.: Monday,\r\n5-1/2_d._; Tuesday, 6_d._; Wednesday, 4-1/2_d._; Thursday, 7_d._;\r\nFriday, 5-1/2_d._; and Saturday, 5_d._ This he received in money, and\r\nwas independent of beer. He had on the same week drawn rather more than\r\nfive loads each day, to the yard, which made his gross earnings for the\r\nweek, wages and perquisites together, to be 14_s._ 0-1/2_d._ which he\r\nconsiders to be a fair average of his weekly earnings as connected with\r\ndust.\r\n\r\n3rd. The loaders of the carts for shipment are the same persons as\r\nthose who collect the dust, but thus employed for the time being. The\r\npay for this work is by the “piece” also, 2_d._ per chaldron between\r\nfour persons being the usual rate, or 1/2_d._ per man. The men so\r\nengaged have no perquisites. The barges into which they shoot the soil\r\nor “brieze,” as the case may be, hold from 50 to 70 chaldrons, and they\r\nconsider the loading of one of these barges a good day’s work. The\r\naverage cargo is about 60 chaldrons, which gives them 2_s._ 6_d._ per\r\nday, or somewhat more than their average earnings when collecting.\r\n\r\n4th. The carriers of cinders to the cinder heap. I have mentioned that,\r\nranged round the sifters in the dust-yard, are a number of baskets,\r\ninto which are put the various things found among the dust, some of\r\nthese being the property of the master, and others the perquisites of\r\nthe hill man or woman, as the case may be. The cinders and old bricks\r\nare the property of the master, and to remove them to their proper\r\nheaps boys are employed by him at 1_s._ per day. These boys are almost\r\nuniversally the children of dustmen and sifters at work in the yard,\r\nand thus not only help to increase the earnings of the family, but\r\nqualify themselves to become the dustmen of a future day.\r\n\r\n5th. The hill-man or hill-woman. The hill-man enters into an agreement\r\nwith the contractor to sift _all_ the dust in the yard throughout\r\nthe year at so much per load and perquisites. The usual sum per\r\nload is 6_d._, nor have I been able to ascertain that any of these\r\npeople undertake to do it at a less price. Such is the amount paid\r\nby the contractor for Whitechapel. The perquisites of the hill-man\r\nor hill-woman, are rags, bones, pieces of old metal, old tin or iron\r\nvessels, old boots and shoes, and one-half of the money, jewellery, or\r\nother valuables that may be found by the sifters.\r\n\r\nThe hill-man or hill-woman employs the following persons, and pays them\r\nat the following rates.\r\n\r\n1st. The sifters are paid 1_s._ per day when employed, but the\r\nemployment is not constant. The work cannot be pursued in wet weather,\r\nand the services of the sifters are required only when a large heap\r\nhas accumulated, as they can sift much faster than the dust can be\r\ncollected. The employment is therefore precarious; the payment has\r\nnot, for the last 30 years at least, been more than 1_s._ per day, but\r\nthe perquisites were greater. They formerly were allowed one-half of\r\nwhatever was found; of late years, however, the hill-man has gradually\r\nreduced the perquisites “first one thing and then another,” until\r\nthe only one they have now remaining is half of whatever money or\r\nother valuable article may be found in the process of sifting. These\r\nvaluables the sifters often pocket, if able to do so unperceived, but\r\nif discovered in the attempt, they are immediately discharged.\r\n\r\n2nd. “The fillers-in,” or shovellers of dust into the sieves of\r\nsifters, are in general any poor fellows who may be straggling about in\r\nsearch of employment. They are sometimes, however, the grown-up boys\r\nof dustmen, not yet permanently engaged by the contractor. These are\r\npaid 2_s._ per day for their labour, but they are considered more as\r\ncasualty men, though it often happens, if “hands” are wanted, that they\r\nare regularly engaged by the contractors, and become regular dustmen\r\nfor the remainder of their lives.\r\n\r\n3rd. The little fellows, the children of the dustmen, who follow their\r\nmothers to the yard, and help them to pick rags, bones, &c., out of the\r\nsieve and put them into the baskets, as soon as they are able to carry\r\na basket between two of them to the separate heaps, are paid 3_d._ or\r\n4_d._ per day for this work by the hill-man.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the dustmen have been increased within the last seven\r\nyears from 6_d._ per load to 8_d._ among the large contractors--the\r\n“small masters,” however, still continue to pay 6_d._ per load. This\r\nincrease in the rate of remuneration was owing to the men complaining\r\nto the commissioners that they were not able to live upon what they\r\nearned at 6_d._; an enquiry was made into the truth of the men’s\r\nassertion, and the result was that the commissioners decided upon\r\nletting the contracts to such parties only as would undertake to pay a\r\nfair price to their workmen. The contractors, accordingly, increased\r\nthe remuneration of the labourers; since then the principal masters\r\nhave paid 8_d._ per load to the collectors. It is right I should\r\nadd, that I could not hear--though I made special enquiries on the\r\nsubject--that the wages had been in any one instance reduced since\r\nFree-trade has come into operation.\r\n\r\nThe usual hours of labour vary according to the mode of payment. The\r\n“collectors,” or men out with the cart, being paid by the load, work\r\nas long as the light lasts; the “fillers-in” and sifters, on the other\r\nhand, being paid by the day, work the ordinary hours, viz., from six to\r\nsix, with the regular intervals for meals.\r\n\r\nThe summer is the worst time for all hands, for then the dust decreases\r\nin quantity; the collectors, however, make up for the “slackness” at\r\nthis period by nightwork, and, being paid by the “piece” or load at the\r\ndust business, are not discharged when their employment is less brisk.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the dustmen who perambulate the streets usually\r\ncollect five loads in a day; this, at 8_d._ per load, leaves them\r\nabout 1_s._ 8_d._ each, and so makes their weekly earnings amount to\r\nabout 10_s._ per week. Moreover, there are the “perquisites” from the\r\nhouses whence they remove the dust; and further, the dust-collectors\r\nare frequently employed at the night-work, which is always a distinct\r\nmatter from the dust-collecting, &c., and paid for independent of their\r\nregular weekly wages, so that, from all I can gather, the average wages\r\nof the men appear to be rather more than 15_s._ Some admitted to me,\r\nthat in busy times they often earned 25_s._ a week.\r\n\r\nThen, again, dustwork, as with the weaving of silk, is a kind of\r\nfamily work. The husband, wife, and children (unfortunately) all work\r\nat it. The consequence is, that the earnings of the whole have to be\r\nadded together in order to arrive at a notion of the aggregate gains.\r\n\r\nThe following may therefore be taken as a fair average of the earnings\r\nof a dustman and his family _when in full employment_. The elder boys\r\nwhen able to earn 1_s._ a day set up for themselves, and do not allow\r\ntheir wages to go into the common purse.\r\n\r\n                             £.  _s._  _d._     £.  _s._  _d._\r\n\r\n  Man, 5 loads per day,\r\n  or 30 loads per week, at\r\n  4_d._ per load             0    10    0\r\n\r\n  Perquisites, or beer\r\n  money                      0     2    9-1/2\r\n\r\n  Night-work for 2 nights\r\n  a week                     0     5    0\r\n                             ------------       0    17    9-1/2\r\n\r\n  Woman, or sifter, per\r\n  week, at 1_s._ per day     0     6    0\r\n\r\n  Perquisites, say 3_d._ a\r\n  day                        0     1    6\r\n                             ------------       0     7    6\r\n\r\n  Child, 3_d._ per day,\r\n  carrying rags, bones, &c.  ------------       0     1    6\r\n                                               -----------------\r\n                        Total                   1     6    9-1/2\r\n\r\nThese are the earnings, it should be borne in mind, of a family in full\r\nemployment. Perhaps it may be fairly said that the earnings of the\r\nsingle men are, on an average, 15_s._ a week, and 1_l._ for the family\r\nmen all the year round.\r\n\r\nNow, when we remember that the wages of many agricultural labourers are\r\nbut 8_s._ a week, and the earnings of many needlewomen not 6_d._ a day,\r\nit must be confessed that the remuneration of the dustmen, and even of\r\nthe dustwomen, is _comparatively_ high. This certainly is not due to\r\nwhat Adam Smith, in his chapter on the Difference of Wages, terms the\r\n“disagreeableness of the employment.” “The wages of labour,” he says,\r\n“vary with the ease or hardship, the cleanliness or dirtiness, the\r\nhonourableness or dishonourableness, of the employment.” It will be\r\nseen--when we come to treat of the nightmen--that the most offensive,\r\nand perhaps the least honourable, of all trades, is far from ranking\r\namong the best paid, as it should, if the above principle held good.\r\nThat the disagreeableness of the occupation may in a measure tend to\r\ndecrease the competition among the labourers, there cannot be the least\r\ndoubt, but that it will consequently induce, as political economy would\r\nhave us believe, a larger amount of wages to accrue to each of the\r\nlabourers, is certainly another of the many assertions of that science\r\nwhich must be pronounced “not proven.” For the dustmen are paid, if\r\nanything, less, and certainly not more, than the usual rate of payment\r\nto the London labourers; and if the earnings rank high, as times go, it\r\nis because all the members of the family, from the very earliest age,\r\nare able to work at the business, and so add to the general gains.\r\n\r\nThe dustmen are, generally speaking, an hereditary race; when\r\nchildren they are reared in the dust-yard, and are habituated to the\r\nwork gradually as they grow up, after which, almost as a natural\r\nconsequence, they follow the business for the remainder of their lives.\r\nThese may be said to be born-and-bred dustmen. The numbers of the\r\nregular men are, however, from time to time recruited from the ranks\r\nof the many ill-paid labourers with which London abounds. When hands\r\nare wanted for any special occasion an employer has only to go to any\r\nof the dock-gates, to find at all times hundreds of starving wretches\r\nanxiously watching for the chance of getting something to do, even at\r\nthe rate of 4_d._ per hour. As the operation of emptying a dust-bin\r\nrequires only the ability to handle a shovel, which every labouring man\r\ncan manage, all workmen, however unskilled, can at once engage in the\r\noccupation; and it often happens that the men thus casually employed\r\nremain at the calling for the remainder of their lives. There are no\r\nhouses of call whence the men are taken on when wanting work. There are\r\ncertainly public-houses, which are denominated houses of call, in the\r\nneighbourhood of every dust-yard, but these are merely the drinking\r\nshops of the men, whither they resort of an evening after the labour of\r\nthe day is accomplished, and whence they are furnished in the course of\r\nthe afternoon with beer; but such houses cannot be said to constitute\r\nthe dustman’s “labour-market,” as in the tailoring and other trades,\r\nthey being never resorted to as hiring-places, but rather used by the\r\nmen only when hired. If a master have not enough “hands” he usually\r\ninquires among his men, who mostly know some who--owing, perhaps, to\r\nthe failure of their previous master in getting his usual contract--are\r\nonly casually employed at other places. Such men are immediately\r\nengaged in preference to others; but if these cannot be found, the\r\ncontractors at once have recourse to the system already stated.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the dust is collected is very simple. The “filler”\r\nand the “carrier” perambulate the streets with a heavily-built high\r\nbox cart, which is mostly coated with a thick crust of filth, and\r\ndrawn by a clumsy-looking horse. These men used, before the passing\r\nof the late Street Act, to ring a dull-sounding bell so as to give\r\nnotice to housekeepers of their approach, but now they merely cry, in\r\na hoarse unmusical voice, “Dust oy-eh!” Two men accompany the cart,\r\nwhich is furnished with a short ladder and two shovels and baskets.\r\nThese baskets one of the men fills from the dust-bin, and then helps\r\nthem alternately, as fast as they are filled, upon the shoulder of the\r\nother man, who carries them one by one to the cart, which is placed\r\nimmediately alongside the pavement in front of the house where they are\r\nat work. The carrier mounts up the side of the cart by means of the\r\nladder, discharges into it the contents of the basket on his shoulder,\r\nand then returns below for the other basket which his mate has filled\r\nfor him in the interim. This process is pursued till all is cleared\r\naway, and repeated at different houses till the cart is fully loaded;\r\nthen the men make the best of their way to the dust-yard, where they\r\nshoot the contents of the cart on to the heap, and again proceed on\r\ntheir regular rounds.\r\n\r\nThe dustmen, in their appearance, very much resemble the waggoners\r\nof the coal-merchants. They generally wear knee-breeches, with ancle\r\nboots or gaiters, short dirty smockfrocks or coarse gray jackets, and\r\nfantail hats. In one particular, however, they are at first sight\r\ndistinguishable from the coal-merchants’ men, for the latter are\r\ninvariably black from coal dust, while the dustmen, on the contrary,\r\nare gray with ashes.\r\n\r\nIn their personal appearance the dustmen are mostly tall stalwart\r\nfellows; there is nothing sickly-looking about them, and yet a\r\nconsiderable part of their time is passed in the yards and in the midst\r\nof effluvia most offensive, and, if we believe “zymotic theorists,” as\r\nunhealthy to those unaccustomed to them; nevertheless, the children,\r\nwho may be said to be reared in the yard and to have inhaled the stench\r\nof the dust-heap with their first breath, are healthy and strong. It\r\nis said, moreover, that during the plague in London the dustmen were\r\nthe persons who carted away the dead, and it remains a tradition among\r\nthe class to the present day, that not one of them died of the plague,\r\neven during its greatest ravages. In Paris, too, it is well known,\r\nthat, during the cholera of 1849, the quarter of Belleville, where the\r\nnight-soil and refuse of the city is deposited, escaped the freest from\r\nthe pestilence; and in London the dustmen boast that, during both the\r\nrecent visitations of the cholera, they were altogether exempt from the\r\ndisease. “Look at that fellow, sir!” said one of the dust-contractors\r\nto me, pointing to his son, who was a stout red-cheeked young man of\r\nabout twenty. “Do you see anything ailing about him? Well, he has been\r\nin the yard since he was born. There stands my house just at the gate,\r\nso you see he hadn’t far to travel, and when quite a child he used to\r\nplay and root away here among the dust all his time. I don’t think he\r\never had a day’s illness in his life. The people about the yard are\r\nall used to the smell and don’t complain about it. It’s all stuff and\r\nnonsense, all this talk about dust-yards being unhealthy. I’ve never\r\ndone anything else all my days and I don’t think I look very ill. I\r\nshouldn’t wonder now but what I’d be set down as being fresh from\r\nthe sea-side by those very fellows that write all this trash about a\r\nmatter that they don’t know just _that_ about;” and he snapped his\r\nfingers contemptuously in the air, and, thrusting both hands into his\r\nbreeches pockets, strutted about, apparently satisfied that he had the\r\nbest of the argument. He was, in fact, a stout, jolly, red-faced man.\r\nIndeed, the dustmen, as a class, appear to be healthy, strong men, and\r\nextraordinary instances of longevity are common among them. I heard of\r\none dustman who lived to be 115 years; another, named Wood, died at\r\n100; and the well-known Richard Tyrrell died only a short time back at\r\nthe advanced age of 97. The misfortune is, that we have no large series\r\nof facts on this subject, so that the longevity and health of the\r\ndustmen might be compared with those of other classes.\r\n\r\nIn almost all their habits the Dustmen are similar to the\r\nCostermongers, with the exception that they seem to want their cunning\r\nand natural quickness, and that they have little or no predilection\r\nfor gaming. Costermongers, however, are essentially traders, and all\r\ntrade is a species of gambling--the risking of a certain sum of money\r\nto obtain more; hence spring, perhaps, the gambling propensities of low\r\ntraders, such as costers, and Jew clothes-men; and hence, too, that\r\nnatural sharpness which characterizes the same classes. The dustmen, on\r\nthe contrary, have regular employment and something like regular wages,\r\nand therefore rest content with what they can earn in their usual way\r\nof business.\r\n\r\nVery few of them understand cards, and I could not learn that they ever\r\nplay at “pitch and toss.” I remarked, however, a number of parallel\r\nlines such as are used for playing “shove halfpenny,” on a deal table\r\nin the tap-room frequented by them. The great amusement of their\r\nevenings seems to be, to smoke as many pipes of tobacco and drink as\r\nmany pots of beer as possible.\r\n\r\nI believe it will be found that all persons in the habit of driving\r\nhorses, such as cabmen, ’busmen, stage-coach drivers, &c., are\r\npeculiarly partial to intoxicating drinks. The cause of this I\r\nleave others to determine, merely observing that there would seem\r\nto be two reasons for it: the first is, their frequent stopping at\r\npublic-houses to water or change their horses, so that the idea of\r\ndrinking is repeatedly suggested to their minds even if the practice\r\nbe not _expected_ of them; while the second reason is, that being\r\nout continually in the wet, they resort to stimulating liquors as a\r\npreventive to “colds” until at length a habit of drinking is formed.\r\nMoreover, from the mere fact of passing continually through the\r\nair, they are enabled to drink a greater quantity with comparative\r\nimpunity. Be the cause, however, what it may, the dustmen spend a\r\nlarge proportion of their earnings in drink. There is always some\r\npublic-house in the neighbourhood of the dust-yard, where they obtain\r\ncredit from one week to another, and here they may be found every night\r\nfrom the moment their work is done, drinking, and smoking their long\r\npipes--their principal amusement consisting in “chaffing” each other.\r\nThis “chaffing” consists of a species of scurrilous jokes supposed to\r\nbe given and taken in good part, and the noise and uproar occasioned\r\nthereby increases as the night advances, and as the men get heated\r\nwith liquor. Sometimes the joking ends in a general quarrel; the next\r\nmorning, however, they are all as good friends as ever, and mutually\r\nagree in laying the blame on the “cussed drink.”\r\n\r\nOne-half, at least, of the dustmen’s earnings, is, I am assured,\r\nexpended in drink, both man and woman assisting in squandering their\r\nmoney in this way. They usually live in rooms for which they pay\r\nfrom 1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ per week rent, three or four dust-men and\r\ntheir wives frequently lodging in the same house. These rooms are\r\ncheerless-looking, and almost unfurnished--and are always situate\r\nin some low street or lane not far from the dust-yard. The men have\r\nrarely any clothes but those in which they work. For their breakfast\r\nthe dustmen on their rounds mostly go to some cheap coffee-house, where\r\nthey get a pint or half-pint of coffee, taking their bread with them as\r\na matter of economy. Their midday meal is taken in the public-house,\r\nand is almost always bread and cheese and beer, or else a saveloy or a\r\npiece of fat pork or bacon, and at night they mostly “wind up” by deep\r\npotations at their favourite house of call.\r\n\r\nThere are many dustmen now advanced in years born and reared at the\r\nEast-end of London, who have never in the whole course of their\r\nlives been as far west as Temple-bar, who know nothing whatever of\r\nthe affairs of the country, and who have never attended a place of\r\nworship. As an instance of the extreme ignorance of these people, I\r\nmay mention that I was furnished by one of the contractors with the\r\naddress of a dustman whom his master considered to be one of the most\r\nintelligent men in his employ. Being desirous of hearing his statement\r\nfrom his own lips I sent for the man, and after some conversation\r\nwith him was proceeding to note down what he said, when the moment I\r\nopened my note-book and took the pencil in my hand, he started up,\r\nexclaiming,--“No, no! I’ll have none of that there work--I’m not such\r\na b---- fool as you takes me to be--I doesn’t understand it, I tells\r\nyou, and I’ll not have it, now that’s plain;”--and so saying he ran out\r\nof the room, and descended the entire flight of stairs in two jumps. I\r\nfollowed him to explain, but unfortunately the pencil was still in one\r\nhand and the book in the other, and immediately I made my appearance\r\nat the door he took to his heels, again with three others who seemed\r\nto be waiting for him there. One of the most difficult points in my\r\nlabours is to make such men as these comprehend the object or use of my\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nAmong 20 men whom I met in one yard, there were only five who could\r\nread, and only two out of that five could write, even imperfectly.\r\nThese two are looked up to by their companions as prodigies of learning\r\nand are listened to as oracles, on all occasions, being believed to\r\nunderstand every subject thoroughly. It need hardly be added, however,\r\nthat their acquirements are of the most meagre character.\r\n\r\nThe dustmen are very partial to a song, and always prefer one of the\r\ndoggrel street ballads, with what they call a “jolly chorus” in which,\r\nduring their festivities, they all join with stentorian voices. At the\r\nconclusion there is usually a loud stamping of feet and rattling of\r\nquart pots on the table, expressive of their approbation.\r\n\r\nThe dustmen never frequent the twopenny hops, but sometimes make up\r\na party for the “theaytre.” They generally go in a body with their\r\nwives, if married, and their “gals,” if single. They are always to\r\nbe found in the gallery, and greatly enjoy the melodramas performed\r\nat the second-class minor theatres, especially if there be plenty of\r\nmurdering scenes in them. The Garrick, previous to its being burnt, was\r\na favourite resort of the East-end dustmen. Since that period they\r\nhave patronized the Pavilion and the City of London.\r\n\r\nThe politics of the dustmen are on a par with their literary\r\nattainments--they cannot be said to have any. I cannot say that they\r\nare Chartists, for they have no very clear knowledge of what “the\r\ncharter” requires. They certainly have a confused notion that it is\r\nsomething against the Government, and that the enactment of it would\r\nmake them all right; but as to the nature of the benefits which it\r\nwould confer upon them, or in what manner it would be likely to operate\r\nupon their interest, they have not, as a body, the slightest idea.\r\nThey have a deep-rooted antipathy to the police, the magistrates, and\r\nall connected with the administration of justice, looking upon them as\r\ntheir natural enemies. They associate with none but themselves; and in\r\nthe public-houses where they resort there is a room set apart for the\r\nspecial use of the “dusties,” as they are called, where no others are\r\nallowed to intrude, except introduced by one of themselves, or at the\r\nspecial desire of the majority of the party, and on such occasions the\r\nstranger is treated with great respect and consideration.\r\n\r\nAs to the morals of these people, it may easily be supposed that they\r\nare not of an over-strict character. One of the contractors said to\r\nme, “I’d just trust one of them as far as I could fling a bull by the\r\ntail; _but then_,” he added, with a callousness that proved the laxity\r\nof discipline among the men was due more to his neglect of his duty to\r\nthem than from any special perversity on their parts, “_that’s none of\r\nmy business; they do my work, and that’s all I want with them, and all\r\nI care about_. You see they’re not like other people, they’re reared to\r\nit. Their fathers before them were dustmen, and when lads they go into\r\nthe yard as sifters, and when they grow up they take to the shovel,\r\nand go out with the carts. They learn all they know in the dust-yards,\r\nand you may judge from that what their learning is likely to be. If\r\nthey find anything among the dust you may be sure that neither you\r\nnor I will ever hear anything about it; ignorant as they are, they\r\nknow a little too much for that. They know, as well as here and there\r\none, where the dolly-shop is; _but, as I said before, that’s none of\r\nmy business. Let every one look out for themselves, as I do, and then\r\nthey need not care for any one_.” [With such masters professing such\r\nprinciples--though it should be stated that the sentiments expressed\r\non this occasion are but similar to what I hear from the lower class\r\nof traders every day--how can it be expected that these poor fellows\r\ncan be above the level of the mere beasts of burden that they use.] “As\r\nto their women,” continued the master, “I don’t trouble my head about\r\nsuch things. I believe the dustmen are as good to them as other men;\r\nand I’m sure their wives would be as good as other women, if they only\r\nhad the chance of the best. But you see they’re all such fellows for\r\ndrink that they spend most of their money that way, and then starve the\r\npoor women, and knock them about at a shocking rate, so that they have\r\nthe life of dogs, or worse. I don’t wonder at anything they do. Yes,\r\nthey’re all married, as far as I know; that is, they live together as\r\nman and wife, though they’re not very particular, certainly, about the\r\nceremony. The fact is, a regular dustman don’t understand much about\r\nsuch matters, and, I believe, don’t care much, either.”\r\n\r\nFrom all I could learn on this subject, it would appear that, for one\r\ndustman that is married, 20 live with women, but remain constant to\r\nthem; indeed, both men and women abide faithfully by each other, and\r\nfor this reason--the woman earns nearly half as much as the man. If the\r\nmen and women were careful and prudent, they might, I am assured, live\r\nwell and comfortable; but by far the greater portion of the earnings\r\nof both go to the publican, for I am informed, on competent authority,\r\nthat a dustman will not think of sitting down for a spree without his\r\nwoman. The children, as soon as they are able to go into the yard, help\r\ntheir mothers in picking out the rags, bones, &c., from the sieve,\r\nand in putting them in the basket. They are never sent to school, and\r\nas soon as they are sufficiently strong are mostly employed in some\r\ncapacity or other by the contractor, and in due time become dustmen\r\nthemselves. Some of the children, in the neighbourhood of the river,\r\nare mud-larks, and others are bone-grubbers and rag-gatherers, on a\r\nsmall scale; neglected and thrown on their own resources at an early\r\nage, without any but the most depraved to guide them, it is no wonder\r\nto find that many of them turn thieves. To this state of the case there\r\nare, however, some few exceptions.\r\n\r\nSome of the dustmen are prudent well-behaved men and have decent homes;\r\nmany of this class have been agricultural labourers, who by distress,\r\nor from some other cause, have found their way to London. This was the\r\ncase with one whom I talked with: he had been a labourer in Essex,\r\nemployed by a farmer named Izzod, whom he spoke of as being a kind good\r\nman. Mr. Izzod had a large farm on the Earl of Mornington’s estate,\r\nand after he had sunk his capital in the improvement of the land, and\r\nwas about to reap the fruits of his labour and his money, the farmer\r\nwas ejected at a moment’s notice, beggared and broken-hearted. This\r\noccurred near Roydon, in Essex. The labourer, finding it difficult to\r\nobtain work in the country, came to London, and, discovering a cousin\r\nof his engaged in a dust-yard, got employed through him at the same\r\nplace, where he remains to the present day. This man was well clothed,\r\nhe had good strong lace boots, gray worsted stockings, a stout pair of\r\ncorduroy breeches, a short smockfrock and fantail. He has kept himself\r\naloof, I am told, from the drunkenness and dissipation of the dustmen.\r\nHe says that many of the new hands that get to dustwork are mechanics\r\nor people who have been “better off,” and that these get thinking about\r\nwhat they have been, till to drown their care they take to drinking,\r\nand often become, in the course of a year or so, worse than the “old\r\nhands” who have been reared to the business and have “nothing at all to\r\nthink about.”\r\n\r\nAmong the dustmen there is no “Society” nor “Benefit Club,” specially\r\ndevoted to the class--no provident institution whence they can obtain\r\n“relief” in the event of sickness or accident. The consequence is that,\r\nwhen ill or injured, they are obliged to obtain letters of admission\r\nto some of the hospitals, and there remain till cured. In cases of\r\ntotal incapacity for labour, their invariable refuge is the workhouse;\r\nindeed they look forward (whenever they foresee at all) to this asylum\r\nas their resting-place in old age, with the greatest equanimity, and\r\ntalk of it as “the house” par excellence, or as “the big house,” “the\r\ngreat house,” or “the old house.” There are, however, scattered about\r\nin every part of London numerous benefit clubs made up of working-men\r\nof every description, such as Old Friends, Odd Fellows, Foresters, and\r\nBirmingham societies, and with some one or other of these the better\r\nclass of dustmen are connected. The general rule, however, is, that\r\nthe men engaged in this trade belong to no benefit club whatever, and\r\nthat in the season of their adversity they are utterly unprovided for,\r\nand consequently become burdens to the parishes wherein they happen to\r\nreside.\r\n\r\nI visited a large dust-yard at the east end of London, for the purpose\r\nof getting a statement from one of the men. My informant was, at the\r\ntime of my visit, shovelling the sifted soil from one of the lesser\r\nheaps, and, by a great effort of strength and activity, pitching each\r\nshovel-full to the top of a lofty mound, somewhat resembling a pyramid.\r\nOpposite to him stood a little woman, stoutly made, and with her arms\r\nbare above the elbow; she was his partner in the work, and was pitching\r\nshovel-full for shovel-full with him to the summit of the heap. She\r\nwore an old soiled cotton gown, open in front, and tucked up behind in\r\nthe fashion of the last century. She had clouts of old rags tied round\r\nher ancles to prevent the dust from getting into her shoes, a sort of\r\ncoarse towel fastened in front for an apron, and a red handkerchief\r\nbound tightly round her head. In this trim she worked away, and not\r\nonly kept pace with the man, but often threw two shovels for his one,\r\nalthough he was a tall, powerful fellow. She smiled when she saw me\r\nnoticing her, and seemed to continue her work with greater assiduity. I\r\nlearned that she was deaf, and spoke so indistinctly that no stranger\r\ncould understand her. She had also a defect in her sight, which latter\r\ncircumstance had compelled her to abandon the sifting, as she could not\r\nwell distinguish the various articles found in the dust-heap. The poor\r\ncreature had therefore taken to the shovel, and now works with it every\r\nday, doing the labour of the strongest men.\r\n\r\nFrom the man above referred to I obtained the following\r\nstatement:--“Father vos a dustie;--vos at it all his life, and\r\ngrandfather afore him for I can’t tell how long. Father vos allus a rum\r\n’un;--sich a beggar for lush. Vhy I’m blowed if he vouldn’t lush as\r\nmuch as half-a-dozen on ’em can lush now; somehow the dusties hasn’t\r\ngot the stuff in ’em as they used to have. A few year ago the fellers\r\n’u’d think nothink o’ lushin avay for five or six days without niver\r\ngoing anigh their home. I niver vos at a school in all my life; I don’t\r\nknow what it’s good for. It may be wery well for the likes o’ you, but\r\nI doesn’t know it ’u’d do a dustie any good. You see, ven I’m not out\r\nwith the cart, I digs here all day; and p’raps I’m up all night, and\r\ndigs avay agen the next day. Vot does I care for reading, or anythink\r\nof that there kind, ven I gets home arter my vork? I tell you vot I\r\nlikes, though! vhy, I jist likes two or three pipes o’ baccer, and a\r\npot or two of good heavy and a song, and then I tumbles in with my\r\nSall, and I’m as happy as here and there von. That there Sall of mine’s\r\na stunner--a riglar stunner. There ain’t never a voman can sift a heap\r\nquickerer nor my Sall. Sometimes she yarns as much as I does; the only\r\nthing is, she’s sitch a beggar for lush, that there Sall of mine, and\r\nthen she kicks up sitch jolly rows, you niver see the like in your\r\nlife. That there’s the only fault, as I know on, in Sall; but, barring\r\nthat, she’s a hout-and-houter, and worth a half-a-dozen of t’ other\r\nsifters--pick ’em out vare you likes. No, we ain’t married ’zactly,\r\nthough it’s all one for all that. I sticks to Sall, and Sall sticks\r\nto I, and there’s an end on’t:--vot is it to any von? I rec’lects\r\na-picking the rags and things out of mother’s sieve, when I were a\r\nyoung ’un, and a putting ’em all in the heap jist as it might be there.\r\nI vos allus in a dust-yard. I don’t think I could do no how in no other\r\nplace. You see I vouldn’t be ’appy like; I only knows how to vork at\r\nthe dust ’cause I’m used to it, and so vos father afore me, and I’ll\r\nstick to it as long as I can. I yarns about half-a-bull [2_s._ 6_d._] a\r\nday, take one day with another. Sall sometimes yarns as much, and ven I\r\ngoes out at night I yarns a bob or two more, and so I gits along pretty\r\ntidy; sometimes yarnin more and sometimes yarnin less. I niver vos sick\r\nas I knows on; I’ve been queerish of a morning a good many times, but\r\nI doesn’t call that sickness; it’s only the lush and nothink more. The\r\nsmells nothink at all, ven you gits used to it. Lor’ bless you! you’d\r\nthink nothink on it in a veek’s time,--no, no more nor I do. There’s\r\ntventy on us vorks here--riglar. I don’t think there’s von on ’em ’cept\r\nScratchey Jack can read, but he can do it stunning; he’s out vith the\r\ncart now, but he’s the chap as can patter to you as long as he likes.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the capital and income of the London dust business, the\r\nfollowing estimate may be given as to the amount of property invested\r\nin and accruing to the trade.\r\n\r\nIt has been computed that there are 90 contractors, large and small;\r\nof these upwards of two-thirds, or about 35, may be said to be in a\r\nconsiderable way of business, possessing many carts and horses, as well\r\nas employing a large body of people; some yards have as many as 150\r\nhands connected with them. The remaining 55 masters are composed of\r\n“small men,” some of whom are known as “running dustmen,” that is to\r\nsay, persons who collect the dust without any sanction from the parish;\r\nbut the number belonging to this class has considerably diminished\r\nsince the great deterioration in the price of “brieze.” Assuming, then,\r\nthat the great and little master dustmen employ on an average between\r\nsix and seven carts each, we have the following statement as to the\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL OF THE LONDON DUST TRADE.\r\n\r\n   600 Carts, at 20_l._ each               £12,000\r\n   600 Horses, at 25_l._ each               15,000\r\n   600 Sets of harness, at 2_l._ per set     1,200\r\n   600 Ladders, at 5_s._ each                  150\r\n  1200 Baskets, at 2_s._ each                  120\r\n  1200 Shovels, at 2_s._ each                  120\r\n                                           -------\r\n       Being a total capital of            £28,590\r\n                                           -------\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we assert that the capital of this trade is between\r\n25,000_l._ and 30,000_l._ in value, we shall not be far wrong either\r\nway.\r\n\r\nOf the annual income of the same trade, it is almost impossible to\r\narrive at any positive results; but, in the absence of all authentic\r\ninformation on the subject, we may make the subjoined conjecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCOME OF THE LONDON DUST TRADE.\r\n\r\n  Sum paid to contractors for the removal\r\n  of dust from the 176 metropolitan\r\n  parishes, at 200_l._ each parish          £35,200\r\n\r\n  Sum obtained for 900,000 loads of\r\n  dust, at 2_s._ 6_d._ per load             112,500\r\n                                           --------\r\n                                           £147,700\r\n                                           --------\r\n\r\nThus it would appear that the total income of the dust trade may be\r\ntaken at between 145,000_l._ and 150,000_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nAgainst this we have to set the yearly out-goings of the business,\r\nwhich may be roughly estimated as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENDITURE OF THE LONDON DUST TRADE.\r\n\r\n  Wages of 1800 labourers, at 10_s._ a\r\n  week each (including sifters and carriers)         £46,800\r\n  Keep of 600 horses, at 10_s._ a week each           15,600\r\n  Wear and tear of stock in trade                       4000\r\n  Rent for 90 yards, at 100_l._ a year each\r\n  (large and small)                                     9000\r\n                                                     -------\r\n                                                     £75,400\r\n                                                     -------\r\n\r\nThe above estimates give us the following aggregate results:--\r\n\r\n  Total yearly incomings of the London dust trade   £147,700\r\n  Total yearly out-goings                             75,400\r\n                                                    --------\r\n  Total yearly profit                                £72,300\r\n                                                    --------\r\n\r\nHence it would appear that the profits of the dust-contractors are very\r\nnearly at the rate of 100_l._ per cent. on their expenditure. I do\r\nnot think I have over estimated the incomings, or under estimated the\r\nout-goings; at least I have striven to avoid doing so, in order that no\r\ninjustice might be done to the members of the trade.\r\n\r\nThis aggregate profit, when divided among the 90 contractors, will make\r\nthe clear gains of each master dustman amount to about 800_l._ per\r\nannum: of course some derive considerably more than this amount, and\r\nsome considerably less.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LONDON SEWERAGE AND SCAVENGERY.\r\n\r\nThe subject I have now to treat--principally as regards street-labour,\r\nbut generally in its sanitary, social, and economical bearings--may\r\nreally be termed vast. It is of the cleansing of a capital city, with\r\nits thousands of miles of streets and roads _on_ the surface, and its\r\nthousands of miles of sewers and drains _under_ the surface of the\r\nearth. And first let me deal with the subject in a historical point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nPublic scavengery or street-cleansing, from the earliest periods of\r\nour history, since municipal authority regulated the internal economy\r\nof our cities, has been an object of some attention. In the records of\r\nall our civic corporations may be found bye-laws, or some equivalent\r\nmeasure, to enforce the cleansing of the streets. But these regulations\r\nwere little enforced. It was ordered that the streets should be swept,\r\nbut often enough men were not employed by the authorities to sweep\r\nthem; until after the great fire of London, and in many parts for years\r\nafter that, the tradesman’s apprentice swept the dirt from the front\r\nof his master’s house, and left it in the street, to be removed at the\r\nleisure of the scavenger. This was in the streets most famous for the\r\nwealth and commercial energy of the inhabitants. The streets inhabited\r\nby the poor, until about the beginning of the present century, were\r\nrarely swept at all. The unevenness of the pavement, the accumulation\r\nof wet and mud in rainy weather, the want of foot-paths, and sometimes\r\neven of grates and kennels, made Cowper, in one of his letters,\r\ndescribe a perambulation of some of these streets as “going by water.”\r\n\r\nEven this state of things was, however, an improvement. In the accounts\r\nof the London street-broils and fights, from the reign of Henry III.,\r\nmore especially during the war of the Roses, down to the civil war\r\nwhich terminated in the beheading of Charles I., mention is more or\r\nless made of the combatants having availed themselves of the shelter\r\nof the rubbish in the streets. These mounds of rubbish were then kinds\r\nof street-barricades, opposing the progress of passengers, like the\r\npiles of overturned omnibuses and other vehicles of the modern French\r\nstreet-combatants. There is no doubt that in the older times these\r\nmounds were composed, first, of the earth dug out for the foundation of\r\nsome building, or the sinking of some well, or (later on) the formation\r\nof some drain; for these works were often long in hand, not only from\r\nthe interruptions of civil strife and from want of funds, but from\r\nindifference, owing to the long delay in their completion, and were\r\noften altogether abandoned. After dusk the streets of the capital of\r\nEngland could not be traversed without lanterns or torches. This was\r\nthe case until the last 40 or 50 years in nearly all the smaller towns\r\nof England, but there the darkness was the principal obstacle; in the\r\ninferior parts of “Old London,” however, there were the additional\r\ninconveniences of broken limbs and robbery.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to adduce instances from the olden writers in proof of\r\nall the above statements, but it seems idle to cite proofs of what is\r\nknown to all.\r\n\r\nThe care of the streets, however, as regards the removal of the dirt,\r\nor, as the weather might be, the dust and mud, seems never to have\r\nbeen much of a national consideration. It was left to the corporations\r\nand the parishes. Each of these had its own especial arrangements\r\nfor the collection and removal of dirt in its own streets; and as\r\neach parochial or municipal system generally differed in some respect\r\nor other, taken as a whole, there was no one general mode or system\r\nadopted. To all this the street-management of our own days, in the\r\nrespect of scavengery, and, as I shall show, of sewerage, presents\r\na decided improvement. This improvement in street-management is not\r\nattributable to any public agitation--to any public, and, far less,\r\nnational manifestation of feeling. It was debated sometimes in courts\r\nof Common Council, in ward and parochial meetings, but the public\r\ngenerally seem to have taken no express interest in the matter. The\r\nimprovement seems to have established itself gradually from the\r\nimproved tastes and habits of the people.\r\n\r\nAlthough _generally_ left to the local powers, the subject of\r\nstreet-cleansing and management, however, has not been _entirely_\r\noverlooked by Parliament. Among parliamentary enactments is the\r\nmeasure best known as “Michael Angelo Taylor’s Act,” passed early in\r\nthe present century, which requires all householders every morning\r\nto remove from the front of their premises any snow which may have\r\nfallen during the night, &c., &c.; the late Police Acts also embrace\r\nsubordinately the subject of street-management.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the sewers have long been the object of national\r\ncare. “The daily great damages and losses which have happened in many\r\nand divers parts of this realm” (I give the spirit of the preamble of\r\nseveral Acts of Parliament), “as well by the reason of the outrageous\r\nflowings, surges, and course of the river in and upon the marsh\r\ngrounds and other low places, heretofore through public wisdom won\r\nand made profitable for the great commonwealth of this realm, as also\r\nby occasion of land waters and other outrageous springs in and upon\r\nmeadows, pastures, and other low grounds adjoining to rivers, floods,\r\nand other water-courses,” caused parliamentary attention to be given to\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nUntil towards the latter part of the last century, however, the streets\r\neven of the better order were often flooded during heavy and continuous\r\nrains, owing to the sewers and drains having been choked, so that the\r\nsewage forced its way through the gratings into the streets and yards,\r\nflooding all the underground apartments and often the ground floors of\r\nthe houses, as well as the public thoroughfares with filth.\r\n\r\nIt is not many months since the neighbourhood of so modern a locality\r\nas Waterloo-bridge was flooded in this manner, and boats were used\r\nin the Belvidere and York-roads. On the 1st of August, 1846, after a\r\ntremendous storm of thunder, hail, and rain, miles of the capital were\r\nliterally under water; hundreds of publicans’ beer-cellars contained\r\nfar more water than beer, and the damage done was enormous. These facts\r\nshow that though much has been accomplished towards the efficient\r\nsewerage of the metropolis, much remains to be accomplished still.\r\n\r\nThe first statute on the subject of the public sewerage was as early\r\nas the 9th year of the reign of Henry III. There were enactments,\r\nalso, in most of the succeeding reigns, but they were all partial and\r\nconflicting, and related more to local desiderata than to any system\r\nof sewerage for the public benefit, until the reign of Henry VIII.,\r\nwhen the “Bill of Sewers” was passed (in 1531). This act provided for a\r\nmore general system of sewerage in the cities and towns of the kingdom,\r\nrequiring the main channels to be of certain depths and dimensions,\r\naccording to the localities, situation, &c. In many parts of the\r\ncountry the sewerage is still carried on according to the provisions in\r\nthe act of Henry VIII., but those provisions were modified, altered, or\r\n“explained,” by many subsequent statutes.\r\n\r\nAny uniformity which might have arisen from the observance of the\r\nsame principles of sewerage was effectually checked by the measures\r\nadopted in London, more especially during the last 100 years. As\r\nthe metropolis increased new sewerage became necessary, and new\r\nlocal bodies were formed for its management. These were known as\r\nthe Commissions of Sewers, and the members of those bodies acted\r\nindependently one of another, under the authority of their own Acts of\r\nParliament, each having its own board, engineers, clerks, officers,\r\nand workmen. Each commission was confined to its own district, and\r\ndid what was accounted best for its own district with little regard\r\nto any general plan of sewerage, so that London was, and in a great\r\nmeasure is, sewered upon different principles, as to the size of the\r\nsewers and drains, the rates of inclination, &c. &c. In 1847 there\r\nwere eight of these districts and bodies: the City of London, the\r\nTower Hamlets, Saint Katherine’s, Poplar and Blackwall, Holborn and\r\nFinsbury, Westminster and part of Middlesex, Surrey and Kent, and\r\nGreenwich. In 1848 these several bodies were concentrated by act of\r\nparliament, and entitled the “Metropolitan Commission of Sewers;” but\r\nthe City of London, as appears to be the case with every parliamentary\r\nmeasure affecting the metropolis, presents an exception, as it retains\r\na separate jurisdiction, and is not under the control of the general\r\ncommissioners, to whom parliament has given authority over such matters.\r\n\r\nThe management of the metropolitan scavengery and sewerage, therefore,\r\ndiffers in this respect. The scavengery is committed to the care of\r\nthe several parishes, each making its own contract; the sewerage is\r\nconsigned by Parliament to a body of commissioners. In both instances,\r\nhowever, the expenses are paid out of local rates.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to treat of each of these subjects separately,\r\nbeginning with the cleansing of the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREETS OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nThere are now three modes of pavement in the streets of the metropolis.\r\n\r\n1. _The stone pavement_ (commonly composed of Aberdeen granite).\r\n\r\n2. _The macadamized pavement_, or rather _road_.\r\n\r\n3. _The wood pavement._\r\n\r\nThe stone pavement has generally, in the several towns of England,\r\nbeen composed of whatever material the quarries or rocks of the\r\nneighbourhood supplied, limestone being often thus used. In some\r\nplaces, where there were no quarries available, the stones of a river\r\nor rivulet-side were used, but these were rounded and slippery,\r\nand often formed but a rugged pathway. For London pavement, the\r\nneighbourhood not being rich in stone quarries, granite has usually\r\nbeen brought by water from Scotland, and a small quantity from Guernsey\r\nfor the pavement of the streets. The stone pavement is made by the\r\nplacing of the granite stones, hewn and shaped ready for the purpose,\r\nside by side, with a foundation of concrete. The concrete now used for\r\nthe London street-pavement is Thames ballast, composed of shingles, or\r\nsmall stones, and mixed with lime, &c.\r\n\r\nMacadamization was not introduced into the _streets_ of London until\r\nabout 25 years ago. Before that, it had been carried to what was\r\naccounted a great degree of perfection on many of the principal mail\r\nand coach roads. Some 50 miles on the Great North Road, or that between\r\nLondon and Carlisle, were often pointed out as an admirable specimen of\r\nroad-making on Mac Adam’s principles. This road was well known in the\r\nold coaching days as Leming-lane, running from Boroughbridge to Greta\r\nBridge, in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThe first thoroughfare in London which was macadamized, a word adapted\r\nfrom the name of Sir W. Mac Adam, the originator or great improver of\r\nthe system, was St. James’s-square; after that, some of the smaller\r\nstreets in the aristocratic parishes of St. James and St. George were\r\nthus paved, and then, but not without great opposition, Piccadilly. The\r\nopposition to the macadamizing of the latter thoroughfare assumed many\r\nforms. Independently of the conflicting statements as to extravagance\r\nand economy, it was urged by the opponents, that the dust and dirt\r\nof the new style of paving would cause the street to be deserted by\r\nthe aristocracy--that the noiselessness of the traffic would cause\r\nthe deaths of the deaf and infirm--that the aristocracy promoted\r\nthis new-fangled street-making, that they might the better “sleep o’\r\nnights,” regardless of all else. One writer especially regretted that\r\nthe Duke of Queensberry, popularly known as “Old Q.,” who resided at\r\nthe western end of Piccadilly, had not lived to enjoy, undisturbed\r\nby vulgar noises, his bed of down, until it was his hour to rise and\r\ntake his bath of perfumed milk! In short, there was all the fuss and\r\nabsurdity which so often characterise local contests.\r\n\r\nThe macadamized street is made by a layer of stones, broken small\r\nand regular in size, and spread evenly over the road, so that the\r\npressure and friction of the traffic will knead, grind, crush, and\r\nknit them into one compact surface. Until road-making became better\r\nunderstood, or until the early part of the present century, the\r\nroads even in the suburbs immediately connected with London, such as\r\nIslington, Kingsland, Stoke Newington, and Hackney, were “repaired\r\nwhen they wanted it.” If there were a “rut,” or a hole, it was filled\r\nup or covered over with stones, and as the drivers usually avoided\r\nsuch parts, for the sake of their horses’ feet, another rut was\r\nspeedily formed alongside of the original one. Under the old system,\r\nroad-mending was patch-work; defects were sought to be remedied, but\r\nthere was little or no knowledge of constructing or of reconstructing\r\nthe surface as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe wood pavement came last, and was not established, even partially,\r\nuntil eleven or twelve years ago. One of the earliest places so paved\r\nwas the Old Bailey, in order that the noise of the street-traffic might\r\nbe deadened in the Criminal Courts. The same plan was adopted alongside\r\nsome of the churches, and other public buildings, where external\r\nquietude, or, at any rate, diminished noise, was desired. At the first,\r\nthere were great complaints made, and frequent expostulations addressed\r\nto the editors of the newspapers, as to the slipperiness of the wooden\r\nways. The wood pavement is formed of blocks of wood, generally deal,\r\nfitted to one another by grooves, by joints, or by shape, for close\r\nadjustment. They are placed on the road over a body of concrete, in the\r\nsame way as granite.\r\n\r\n“In constructing roads, or rather streets, through towns or cities,\r\nwhere the amount of traffic is considerable, it will be found\r\ndesirable,” says Mr. Law, in his ‘Treatise on the Constructing\r\nand Repairing of Roads,’ “to pave their surface. The advantages\r\nbelonging to pavements in such situations over macadamized roads are\r\nconsiderable; where the latter are exposed to an incessant and heavy\r\ntraffic, their surface becomes rapidly worn, rendering constant repairs\r\nrequisite, which are not only attended with very heavy expense, but\r\nalso render the road very unpleasant for being travelled upon while\r\nbeing done; they also require much more attention in the way of\r\nscraping or sweeping, and in raking in ruts. And some difficulty would\r\nbe experienced in towns to find places in which the materials, which\r\nwould be constantly wanted for repairing the road, could be deposited.\r\nIn dry weather the macadamized road would always be dusty, and in wet\r\nweather it would be covered with mud. The only advantage which such a\r\nroad really possesses over a pavement is the less noise produced by\r\ncarriages in passing over it; but this advantage is very small when the\r\npavement is properly laid.”\r\n\r\nConcerning wood pavements the same gentleman says, “Of late years\r\nwood has been introduced as a material for paving streets, and has\r\nbeen rather extensively employed both in Russia and America. It has\r\nbeen tried in various parts of London, and generally with small\r\nsuccess, the cause of its failure being identical with the cause of\r\nthe enormous sums being spent annually in the repairs of the streets\r\ngenerally, namely, the want of a proper foundation; a want which was\r\nsooner felt with wood than with granite, in consequence of the less\r\nweight and inertia of the wood. The comfort resulting from the use\r\nof wooden pavement, both to those who travelled, and those who lived\r\nin the streets, from the diminished jolting and noise, was so great,\r\nthat it is just matter of surprise that so little care was taken in\r\nforming that which a very little consideration would have shown to be\r\nindispensable to its success, namely, a good foundation. Slipperiness\r\nof its surface, in particular states of the weather, was also found\r\nto be a disadvantage belonging to wooden pavement; but means might be\r\ndevised which would render its surface at all times safe, and afford\r\na secure footing for horses. As regards durability, it has scarcely\r\nbeen used for a sufficient period to allow a comparison being made with\r\nother materials, but from the result of some observations communicated\r\nby Mr. Hope to the Scottish Society of Arts, it appears that wooden\r\nblocks when placed with the end of the grain exposed, wear _less than\r\ngranite_. At first sight, this result might appear questionable,\r\nbut it is a well-ascertained fact that, where wood and iron move in\r\ncontact in machinery, the iron generally wears more rapidly than the\r\nwood, the reason appearing to be, that the surface of the wood soon\r\nbecomes covered with particles of dust and grit, which become partially\r\nembedded in it, and, while they serve to protect the wood, convert its\r\nsurface into a species of file, which rapidly wears away whatever it\r\nrubs against.”\r\n\r\nSuch then are the different modes of constructing the London roads\r\nor streets. I shall now endeavour to show the relative length,\r\nand relative cost of the streets thus severally prepared for the\r\ncommercial, professional, and pleasurable transit of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe comparative extent of the macadamized, of the stone, and of the\r\nwood pavement of the streets of the metropolis has not as yet been\r\nascertained, for no general account has appeared condensing the\r\nreports, returns, accounts, &c., of the several specific bodies of\r\nmanagement into one grand total.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, possible to arrive at an approximation as to\r\nthe comparative extent I have spoken of; and in this attempt at\r\napproximation, in the absence of all means of a definite statistical\r\ncomputation, I have had the assistance of an experienced and practical\r\nsurveyor, familiar with the subject.\r\n\r\nMacadamization prevails beyond the following boundaries:--\r\n\r\nNorth of the New-road and of its extension, as the City-road, and\r\nwestward of the New-road’s junction with Lisson-grove.\r\n\r\nWestward of Park-lane and of the West-end parks.\r\n\r\nEastward of Brick-lane (Spitalfields) and of the Whitechapel\r\nHigh-street.\r\n\r\nSouthward (on the Surrey side) from the New-cut and Long-lane,\r\nBermondsey, and both in the eastern and western direction of Southwark,\r\nLambeth, and the other southern parishes.\r\n\r\nStone pavement, on the other hand, prevails in the district which may\r\nbe said to be within this boundary, bearing down upon the Thames in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nIt is, doubtlessly, the fact that in both the districts thus indicated\r\nexceptions to the general rule may prevail--that in one, for instance,\r\nthere may be some miles of macadamized way, and in the other some miles\r\nof granite pavements; but such exceptions, I am told by a Commissioner\r\nof Paving, may fairly be dismissed as balancing each other.\r\n\r\nThe wooden pavement, I am informed on the same authority, does not\r\nnow comprise five miles of the London thoroughfares; little notice,\r\ntherefore, need be taken of it.\r\n\r\nThe miles of streets in the City in which stone only affords the street\r\nmedium of locomotion are 50. The stone pavement in the localities\r\noutside of this area are six times, or approaching to seven times,\r\nthe extent of that in the City. I have no actual admeasurement to\r\ndemonstrate this point, for none exists, and no private individual can\r\noffer to measure hundreds of miles of streets in order to ascertain\r\nthe composition of their surface. But the calculation has been made\r\nfor me by a gentleman thoroughly conversant with the subject, and\r\nwell acquainted with the general relative proportion of the defined\r\ndistricts, parishes, and boroughs of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nWe have thus the following result, as regards the inner police\r\ndistrict, or Metropolis Proper:--\r\n\r\n                                Miles.\r\n  Granite paved streets           400\r\n  Macadamized ditto (or roads)   1350\r\n  Wood ditto                        5\r\n                                 ----\r\n                         Total   1755\r\n\r\nThis may appear a disproportionate estimate, but when it is remembered\r\nthat the inner police district of the metropolis extends as far as\r\nHampstead, Tooting, Brentford, and Greenwich, it will be readily\r\nperceived that the relative proportions of the macadamized and paved\r\nroads are much about the same as is here stated.\r\n\r\nAs to the cost of these several roads, I will, before entering upon\r\nthat part of the subject, state the prices of the different materials\r\nused in their manufacture.\r\n\r\nAberdeen granite is now 1_l._ 5_s._ per ton, delivered, and prepared\r\nfor paving, or, as it is often called, “pitching.” A ton of “seven\r\ninch” granite, that is, granite sunk seven inches in the ground, will\r\ncover from two and three-quarters to three square yards, superficial\r\nmeasure, or nine feet per yard. The cost, labour included, is,\r\ntherefore, from 9_s._ to 12_s._ the square yard. This appears very\r\ncostly; but in some of the more quiet streets, such as those in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of Golden and Fitzroy-squares, a good granite\r\npavement will endure for 20 years, requiring little repair. In other\r\nstreets, such as Cheapside, for instance, it lasts from three to\r\nfour years, without repavement being necessary, supposing the best\r\nconstruction has been originally adopted.\r\n\r\nFor macadamized streets, where there is a traffic like that of\r\nTottenham Court-road, three layers of small broken granite a year are\r\nnecessary; the cost of this repavement being about 2_s._ 6_d._ a yard\r\nsuperficial measure. The repairs and relayings on macadamized roads of\r\nregular traffic range from 4_s._ to 6_s._ 6_d._ yearly, the square yard.\r\n\r\nThe wood pavement, which endures, with a trifling outlay for repairs,\r\nfor about three years, costs, on an average, 11_s._ the square yard.\r\n\r\nThe concrete used as a foundation in this street-construction costs\r\n4_s._ 6_d._ a cube yard, or 27 feet, by which admeasurement it is\r\nalways calculated. A cube yard of Thames ballast weighs about 1-1/4 ton.\r\n\r\nThe average cost of street-building, new, taking an average breadth, or\r\nabout ten yards, from footpath to footpath, is then--\r\n\r\n                                               Per Mile.\r\n                                            £.  _s._  _d._\r\n  Granite built                             96   0     0\r\n  Macadamized                               44   0     0\r\n  Wood                                      88   0     0\r\n\r\nOr, as a total,\r\n\r\n  400 miles of granite paved streets\r\n    at £96 per mile                     38,400   0     0\r\n  1350 macadamized ditto, at\r\n    £44 per mile                        59,400   0     0\r\n  5 wood ditto, at £88 per mile            440   0     0\r\n                                        ----------------\r\n                                        98,240   0     0\r\n\r\nThis, then (about £100,000), is the _original cost_ of the roads of the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nThe cost of repairs, &c., annually, is shown by the amount of the\r\npaving rate, which may be taken as an average.\r\n\r\n                                            £   _s._  _d._\r\n  400 miles of granite, at 20_s._ per\r\n    mile                                   400   0     0\r\n  1350 macadamized ditto, at\r\n    £13 4_s._ per mile                  17,820   0     0\r\n  5 wood[13] ditto, at 20_s._\r\n    per mile                                 5   0     0\r\n                                        ----------------\r\n                    Total               18,225   0     0\r\n\r\nAccording to a “General Survey of the Metropolitan Highways,” by Mr.\r\nThomas Hughes, the principal roads leading out of London are:--\r\n\r\n1. _The Cambridge Road_, from Shoreditch through Kingsland.\r\n\r\n2. _The Epping and Chelmsford Roads_, from Whitechapel, through Bow and\r\nStratford.\r\n\r\n3. _The Barking Road_, along the Commercial Road past Limehouse.\r\n\r\n4. _The Dover Road_, from the Elephant and Castle, across Blackheath.\r\n\r\n5. _The Brighton Roads_, (_a_) through Croydon, (_b_) through Sutton.\r\n\r\n6. _The Guildford Road_, along the Westminster Road through Battersea\r\nand Wandsworth.\r\n\r\n7. _The Staines, or Great Western Road_, from Knightsbridge through\r\nBrentford.\r\n\r\n8. _The Amersham and Aylesbury Road_, along the Harrow Road, and\r\nthrough Harrow-on-the-Hill.\r\n\r\n9. _The St. Alban’s Road_, along the Edgeware Road through Elstree.\r\n\r\n10. _The Oxford Road_, from Bayswater through Ealing.\r\n\r\n11. _The Great Holyhead Road._\r\n                                } From Islington, by and through Barnet.\r\n12. _The Great North Road._\r\n\r\nAs to the amount of resistance to traction offered by different kinds\r\nof pavement, or the same pavement under different circumstances, the\r\nfollowing are the general results of the experiments made by M. Morin,\r\nat the expense of the French Government:--\r\n\r\n1st. The traction is directly proportional to the load, and inversely\r\nproportional to the diameter of the wheel.\r\n\r\n2nd. Upon a paved, or hard macadamized road, the resistance is\r\nindependent of the width of the tire, when it exceeds from three to\r\nfour inches.\r\n\r\n3rd. At a walking pace the traction is the same, under the same\r\ncircumstances, for carriages with springs and without them.\r\n\r\n4th. Upon hard macadamized, and upon paved roads, the traction\r\nincreases with the velocity: the increments of traction being directly\r\nproportional to the increments of velocity above the velocity 3·28\r\nfeet per second, or about 2-1/4 miles per hour. The equal increment of\r\ntraction thus due to each equal increment of velocity is less as the\r\nroad is more smooth, and the carriage less rigid or better hung.\r\n\r\n5th. Upon soft roads of earth, or sand, or turf, or roads fresh and\r\nthickly gravelled, the traction is independent of the velocity.\r\n\r\n6th. Upon a well-made and compact pavement of hewn stones, the traction\r\nat a walking pace is not more than three-fourths of that upon the best\r\nmacadamized roads under similar circumstances; at a trotting pace it is\r\nequal to it.\r\n\r\n7th. The destruction of the road is in all cases greater, as the\r\ndiameters of the wheels are less, and it is greater in carriages\r\nwithout than with springs.\r\n\r\nIn Sir H. Parnell’s book on roads, p. 73, we are told that Sir John\r\nMacneill, by means of an instrument invented by himself for measuring\r\nthe tractive force required on different kinds of road, obtained the\r\nfollowing general results as to the power requisite to move a ton\r\nweight under ordinary circumstances, at a very low velocity.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------+------------------\r\n                                             |    Force, in\r\n            Description of Road.             | pounds, required\r\n                                             |  to move a ton.\r\n  -------------------------------------------+------------------\r\n  On a well-made pavement                    |       33\r\n                                             |\r\n  On a road made with six inches of        } |\r\n    broken stone of great hardness,        } |\r\n    laid either on a foundation of large   } |       46\r\n    stones, set in the form of a pavement, } |\r\n    or upon a bottoming of concrete        } |\r\n                                             |\r\n  On an old flint road, or a road made     } |\r\n    with a thick coating of broken         } |       65\r\n    stone, laid on earth                   } |\r\n                                             |\r\n  On a road made with a thick coating      } |\r\n    of gravel, laid on earth               } |      147\r\n  -------------------------------------------+------------------\r\n\r\nIn the same work the relative degrees of resistance to traction on the\r\nseveral kinds of roads are thus expressed:--\r\n\r\n  On a timber surface                          2\r\n  On a paved road                              2\r\n  On a well-made broken stone road, in a\r\n    dry clean state                            5\r\n  On a well-made broken stone road,\r\n    covered with dust                          8\r\n  On a well-made broken stone road, wet\r\n    and muddy                                 10\r\n  On a gravel or flint road, in a dry\r\n    clean state                               13\r\n  On a gravel or flint road, in a wet\r\n    muddy state                               32\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE TRAFFIC OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nI have shown (at p. 159, vol. ii.) that the number of miles of streets\r\nincluded in the Inner District of the Metropolitan Police is 1750.\r\n\r\nMr. Peter Cunningham, in his excellent “Handbook of Modern London,”\r\ntells us that “the streets of the Metropolis, if put together, would\r\nmeasure 3000 miles in length;” but he does not inform us what limits\r\nhe assigns to the said metropolis; it would seem, however, that he\r\nrefers to the Outer Police District: and in another place he cites the\r\nfollowing as the extent of some of the principal thoroughfares:--\r\n\r\n  New-road         5115 yds. long, or nearly 3     miles.\r\n  Oxford-street    2304      „          „    1-1/2   „\r\n  Regent-street    1730      „          „    1       „\r\n  Piccadilly       1690      „\r\n  City-road        1690      „\r\n  Strand           1396      „\r\n\r\nOf the two great lines of streets parallel to the river, the one\r\nextending along Oxford-street, Holborn, Cheapside, Cornhill, and\r\nWhitechapel to the Regent’s-canal, Mile-end, is, says Mr. McCulloch,\r\n“above six miles in length;” while that which stretches from\r\nKnightsbridge along Piccadilly, the Haymarket, Pall-mall East, the\r\nStrand, Fleet-street, Watling-street, Eastcheap, Tower-street, and so\r\non by Ratcliffe-highway to the West India Docks, is, according to the\r\nsame authority, about equal in length to the other. Mr. Weale asserts,\r\nas we have already seen, that the greatest length of street from\r\neast to west is about fourteen miles, and from north to south about\r\nthirteen miles. The number of streets in London is said to be 10,000,\r\nthough upon what authority the statement is made, and within what\r\ncompass it is meant to be applied, I have not been able to ascertain.\r\nIt is calculated, however, that there are 1900 miles of gas “mains”\r\nlaid down in London and the suburbs; so that adopting the estimate of\r\nthe Commissioners of Police, or 1760 miles of streets, within an area\r\nof about 90 square miles, we cannot go far wrong.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the amount of _traffic_ that takes place daily over this\r\nvast extent of paved road, it is almost impossible to predicate\r\nanything definitely. As yet there are only a few crude facts existing\r\nin connection with the subject. All we know is, that the London streets\r\nare daily traversed by 1500 omnibuses--such was the number of drivers\r\nlicensed by the Metropolitan Commissioners in 1850--and about 3000\r\ncabs--the number of drivers licensed in 1850 was 5000, but many “cabs”\r\nhave a day and night driver as well, and the Return from the Stamp and\r\nTax Office cited below, represents the number of licensed cabriolets,\r\nin 1849, at 2846: besides these public conveyances, there are the\r\nprivate carriages and carts, so that the metropolitan vehicles may be\r\nsaid to employ altogether upwards of 20,000 horses.\r\n\r\nIn the _Morning Chronicle_ I said, when treating of the London\r\nomnibus-drivers and conductors:--“The average journey, as regards the\r\ndistance travelled by each omnibus, is six miles, and that distance is,\r\nin some cases, travelled twelve times a day, or as it is called, ‘six\r\nthere and six back.’ Some omnibuses perform the journey only ten times\r\na day, and some, but a minority, a less number of times. Now, taking\r\nthe average distance travelled by each omnibus at between 45 and 50\r\nmiles a day--and this, I am assured, on the best authority, is within\r\nthe mark, while 60 miles a day might exceed it--and computing the\r\nomnibuses running daily at 1500, we find ‘a travel,’ as it was worded\r\nto me, of upwards of 70,000 miles daily, or a yearly ‘travel’ of more\r\nthan 25,000,000 miles; an extent which is upwards of a thousand times\r\nmore than the circumference of the earth; and that this estimate in no\r\nway exceeds the truth is proved by the sum annually paid to the Excise\r\nfor ‘mileage,’ which amounts on an average to 9_l._ each ’bus’ per\r\nmonth, or collectively to 162,000_l._ per annum, and this, at 1-1/2_d._\r\nper mile (the rate of duty charged), gives 25,920,000 miles as the\r\naggregate distance travelled by the entire number of omnibuses every\r\nyear through the London streets.”\r\n\r\nThe distance travelled by the London cabs may be estimated as\r\nfollows:--Each driver may be said to receive on an average 10_s._ a\r\nday all the year through. Now, the number of licences prove that there\r\nare 5000 cab-drivers in London, and as each of these must travel at\r\nthe least ten miles in order to obtain the daily 10_s._, we may safely\r\nassert that the whole 5000 go over 50,000 miles of ground a day, or, in\r\nround numbers, 18,250,000 miles in the course of the year.\r\n\r\nAccording to a return obtained by Mr. Charles Cochrane from the Stamp\r\nand Tax Office, Somerset House, there were in the metropolis, in\r\n1849-50, the following number of horses:--\r\n\r\n  Private carriage, job, and cart horses (in\r\n    London)                                    3,683\r\n  Ditto (in Westminster)                       6,339\r\n  Cabriolets licensed 2846 (having two\r\n    horses each)                               5,692\r\n  Omnibuses licensed 1350 (four horses\r\n    each)                                      5,500\r\n                                              ------\r\n  Total number of horses in the metropolis    21,214\r\n                                              ------\r\n\r\nI am assured, by persons well acquainted with the omnibus trade,\r\nthat the number of omnibus horses here cited is far too low--as many\r\nproprietors employ ten horses to each “bus,” and none less than\r\nsix. Hence we may fairly assume that there are at the least 25,000\r\nhorses at work every day in the streets of London. Besides the horses\r\nabove mentioned, it is estimated that the number daily coming to the\r\nmetropolis from the surrounding parts is 3000; and calculating that\r\neach of the 25,000, which may be said to be at work out of the entire\r\nnumber, travels eight miles a day, the aggregate length of ground gone\r\nover by the whole would amount to 200,000 miles per diem, or about\r\n70,000,000 miles throughout the year. There are, as we have seen,\r\nupwards of 1750 miles of streets in London. It follows, therefore, that\r\neach piece of pavement would be traversed no less than 40,000 times per\r\nannum, or upwards of a hundred times a day, by some horse or vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, the facts that have been collected concerning the\r\nabsolute traffic of the several parts of London are of the most meagre\r\ndescription. The only observations of any character that have been made\r\nupon the subject are--as far as my knowledge goes--those of M. D’Arcey,\r\nwhich are contained in a French report upon the roads of London, as\r\ncompared with those of Paris.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, speaking of the relative number of vehicles passing\r\nand repassing over certain parts of the two capitals, says:--“The\r\nBoulevards of Paris are the parts where the greatest traffic takes\r\nplace. On the _Boulevard des Capucins_ there pass, every 24 hours, 9070\r\nhorses drawing carriages; on the _Boulevard des Italiens_, 10,750;\r\n_Boulevard Poissonière_, 7720; _Boulevard St. Denis_, 9609; _Boulevard\r\ndes Filles du Calvaire_, 5856: general average of the above, 8600.\r\n_Rue du Faubourg St. Antoine_, 4300; _Avenue des Champs Elysées_,\r\n8959. At London, in Pall Mall, opposite Her Majesty’s Theatre, there\r\npass at least 800 carriages every hour. On London-bridge the number of\r\nvehicles passing and repassing is not less than 13,000 every hour. On\r\nWestminster-bridge the annual traffic amounts to 8,000,000 horses at\r\nthe least. By this it will be seen that the traffic in Paris does not\r\namount to one-half of what it is in the streets of London.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DUST AND DIRT OF THE STREETS OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nWe have merely to reflect upon the vast amount of traffic just shown to\r\nbe daily going on throughout London--to think of the 70,000,000 miles\r\nof journey through the metropolis annually performed by the entire\r\nvehicles (which is more than two-thirds the distance from the earth to\r\nthe sun)--to bear in mind that each part of London is on the average\r\ngone over and over again 40,000 times in the course of the year, and\r\nsome parts as many as 13,000 times in a day--and that every horse and\r\nvehicle by which the streets are traversed are furnished, the one with\r\nfour iron-bound hoofs, and the other with iron-bound wheels--to have\r\nan imperfect idea of the enormous weights and friction continually\r\noperating upon the surface of the streets--as well as the amount of\r\ngrinding and pulverising, and wear and tear, that must be perpetually\r\ntaking place in the paving-stones and macadamized roads of London; and\r\nthus we may be able to form some mental estimate as to the quantity of\r\ndust and dirt annually produced by these means alone.\r\n\r\nBut the table in pp. 186-7, which has been collected at great trouble,\r\nwill give us still more accurate notions on the subject. It is not\r\ngiven as perfect, but as being the best information, in the absence of\r\npositive returns, that was procurable even from the best informed.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have an aggregate total of dust collected from the\r\n_principal_ parts of the metropolis amounting to no less than 141,466\r\nloads. The value of this refuse is said to be as much as 21,221_l._\r\n8_s._, but of this and more I shall speak hereafter. At present I\r\nmerely seek to give the reader a general notion upon the matter. I wish\r\nto show him, before treating of the labourers engaged in the scavenging\r\nof the London streets, the amount of work they have to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TABLE SHOWING THE SEVERAL DIVISIONS OF THE METROPOLIS CLEANSED BY THE\r\nSCAVENGERS AND PARISH MEN, THE NAMES OF THE CONTRACTORS, THE NUMBER\r\nOF MEN AND CARTS EMPLOYED IN COLLECTING, THE QUANTITY OF DUST AND MUD\r\nCOLLECTED DAILY IN THE STREETS IN DRY AND WET WEATHER, WITH THE ANNUAL\r\nVALUE OF THE WHOLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------------+------------+-----------------+\r\n                             |                 | Number of Men   |  Number of Carts  |                 | Number of  |                 |\r\n                             |                 |    employed     |   used daily in   | Number of loads | Cart-Loads |   Annual value  |\r\n                             |                 | at scavenging.  |    scavenging.    |collected daily. |  annually  |     of Dirt     |\r\n  Divisions and Districts.   |     Names of    +--------+--------+--------+----------+--------+--------+  collected |   collected by  |\r\n                             |   Contractors.  | In dry | In wet | In dry |  In wet  | In dry |In wet  |   by the   |   Scavengers.   |\r\n                             |                 |weather.|weather.|weather.| weather. |weather.|weather.| Scavengers.|                 |\r\n  ---------------------------+-----------------+--------+--------+--------+----------+--------+--------+------------+-----------------+\r\n                             |                 |        |        |        |          |        |        |            |  £    _s._  _d._|\r\n  Kensington                 |Parish           |   3    |   5    |   1    |    2     |  3     |  5     |    1252    |   187  16     0 |\r\n  Chelsea                    |Ditto            |   3    |   5    |   1    |    2     |  4     |  6     |    1565    |   234  15     0 |\r\n  Ditto (Hans’ Town)         |Mr. C.

These are severally known as\r\n\r\n(1) _Dust._\r\n\r\n(2) _Horse-dung_ and _cattle-manure_.\r\n\r\n(3) _Mud_, when mixed with water and with general refuse, such as the\r\nremains of fruit and other things thrown into the street and swept\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n(4) _Surface-water_ when mixed with street-sewage.\r\n\r\nThese productions I shall treat severally, and first of the street-dust.\r\n\r\nThe “_detritus_” of the streets of London assumes many forms, and is\r\nknown by many names, according as it is combined with more or less\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n1st. In a perfectly dry state, so that the particles no longer exist\r\neither in a state of cohesion or aggregation, but are minutely divided\r\nand distinct, it is known by the name of “dust.”\r\n\r\n2nd. When in combination with a small quantity of water, so that it\r\nassumes the consistency of a pap, the particles being neither free to\r\nmove nor yet able to resist pressure, the detritus is known by the\r\nname of “mac mud,” or simply “mud,” according as it proceeds from a\r\nmacadamized or stone paved road.\r\n\r\n3rd. When in combination with a greater quantity of water, so that it\r\nis rendered almost liquid, it is known as “slop-dirt.”\r\n\r\n4th. When in combination with a still greater quantity of water, so\r\nthat it is capable of running off into the sewers, it is known by the\r\nname of “street surface-water.”\r\n\r\nThe mud of the streets of London is then merely the dust or detritus\r\nof the granite of which they are composed, agglutinated either with\r\nrain or the water from the watering-carts. Granite consists of silex,\r\nfelspar, and mica. Silex is sand, while felspar and mica are also silex\r\nin combination with alumina (clay), and either potash or magnesia.\r\nHence it would appear to be owing to the affinity of the alumina or\r\nclay for moisture, as well as the property of silex to “gelatinize”\r\nwith water under certain conditions, that the particles of dry dust\r\nderive their property of _agglutinating_, when wetted, and so forming\r\nwhat is termed “mud”--either “mac,” or simple mud, according, as I said\r\nbefore, to the nature of the paving on which it is formed.\r\n\r\nBy _dust_ the street-cleansers mean the collection of every kind of\r\nrefuse in the dust-bins; but I here speak, of course, of the fine\r\nparticles of earthy matter produced by the attrition of our roads when\r\nin a dry state. Street-dust is, more properly speaking, mud deprived of\r\nits moisture by evaporation. Miss Landon (L. E. L.) used to describe\r\nthe London dust as “mud in high spirits,” and perhaps no figure of\r\nspeech could convey a better notion of its character.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the suburbs on windy days London is a perfect\r\ndust-mill, and although the dust may be allayed by the agency of the\r\nwater-carts (by which means it is again converted into “mac,” or mud),\r\nit is not often thoroughly allayed, and is a source of considerable\r\nloss, labour, and annoyance. Street-dust is not collected for any\r\nuseful purpose, so that as there is no return to be balanced against\r\nits prejudicial effects it remains only to calculate the quantity of it\r\nannually produced, and thus to arrive at the extent of the mischief.\r\n\r\nStreet-dust is disintegrated granite, that is, pulverized quartz\r\nand felspar, felspar being principally composed of alumina or clay,\r\nand quartz silex or sand; it is the result of the attrition, or in\r\na word it is the _detritus_, of the stones used in pavements and in\r\nmacadamization; it is further composed of the pulverization of all\r\nhorse and cattle-dung, and of the almost imperceptible, but still, I\r\nam assured, existent powder which arises from the friction of the\r\nwooden pavement even when kept moist. In the roads of the nearest\r\nsuburbs, even around such places as the Regent’s-park, at many seasons\r\nthis dust is produced largely, so that very often an open window for\r\nthe enjoyment of fresh air is one for the intrusion of fresh dust.\r\nThis may be less the case in the busier and more frequently-watered\r\nthoroughfares, but even there the annoyance is great.\r\n\r\nI find in the “Reports” in which this subject is mentioned but little\r\nsaid concerning the influence of dust upon the public health. Dr.\r\nArnott, however, is very explicit on the subject. “It is,” says\r\nhe, “scarcely conceivable that the immense quantities of granite\r\ndust, pounded by one or two hundred thousand pairs of wheels (!)\r\nworking on macadamized streets, should not greatly injure the public\r\nhealth. In houses bordering such streets or roads it is found that,\r\nnotwithstanding the practice of watering, the furniture is often\r\ncovered with dust, even more than once in the day, so that writing on\r\nit with the finger becomes legible, and the lungs and air tubes of the\r\ninhabitants, with a moist lining to detain the dust, are constantly\r\npumping in the same atmosphere. The passengers by a stage-coach in dry\r\nweather, when the wind is moving with them so as to keep them enveloped\r\nin the cloud of dust raised by the horses’ feet and the wheels of the\r\ncoach, have their clothes soon saturated to whiteness, and their lungs\r\nare charged in a corresponding degree. A gentleman who rode only 20\r\nmiles in this way had afterwards to cough and expectorate for ten days\r\nto clear his chest again.”\r\n\r\nIn order that the deleteriousness to health incident to the inhalation\r\nof these fine and offensive particles may be the better estimated, I\r\nmay add, that in every 24 hours an adult breathes 36 hogsheads of air;\r\nand Mr. Erasmus Wilson, in his admirable work on the Skin, has the\r\nfollowing passage concerning the extent of surface presented by the\r\nlungs:--\r\n\r\n“The lungs receive the atmospheric air through the windpipe. At the\r\nroot of the neck the windpipe, or trachea, divides into two branches,\r\ncalled bronchi, and each bronchus, upon entering its respective lung,\r\ndivides into an infinity of small tubes; the latter terminate in small\r\npouches, called air-cells, and a number of these little air-cells\r\ncommunicate together at the extremity of each small tube. The number\r\nof air-cells in the two lungs has been estimated at 1,744,000,000, and\r\nthe extent of the skin which lines the cells and tubes together at\r\n1500 square feet. This calculation of the number of air-cells, and the\r\nextent of the lining membrane, rests, I believe, on the authority of\r\nDr. Addison of Malvern.”\r\n\r\nWhat is the amount of atmospherical granite, dung, and refuse-dust\r\nreceived in a given period into the human lungs, has never, I am\r\ninformed, been ascertained even by approximation; but according to the\r\nabove facts it must be something fearful to contemplate.\r\n\r\nAfter this brief recital of what is known concerning the sanitary part\r\nof the question, I proceed to consider the damage and loss occasioned\r\nby street-dust. In no one respect, perhaps, can this be ascertained\r\nwith perfect precision, but still even a rough approximation to the\r\nextent of the evil is of value, as giving us more definite ideas on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, on reference to the preceding table, that the quantity\r\nof street-refuse collected in dry weather throughout the metropolis is\r\nbetween 300 and 400 cart-loads daily, or upwards of 100,000 cart-loads,\r\nthe greater proportion of which may be termed street-dust.\r\n\r\nThe damage occasioned by the street-dust arises from its penetrating,\r\nbefore removal, the atmosphere both without and within our houses,\r\nand consists in the soiling of wearing apparel, the injury of the\r\nstock-in-trade of shopkeepers, and of household furniture.\r\n\r\nWashing is, of course, dependent upon the duration of time in which\r\nit is proper, in the estimation of the several classes of society,\r\nto retain wearing apparel upon the person, on the bed or the table,\r\nwithout what is termed a “change;” and this duration of time with\r\nthousands of both men and women is often determined by the presence or\r\nabsence of dirt on the garment; and not arbitrarily, as among wealthier\r\npeople, with whom a clean shirt every morning, and a clean table-cloth\r\nevery one, two, three, or more days, as may happen, are regarded as\r\nthings of course, no matter what may be the state of the displaced\r\nlinen.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Health, in one of their Reports, speak very decisively and\r\ndefinitely on this subject. “Common observation of the rate at which\r\nthe skin, linen, and clothes (not to speak of paper, books, prints, and\r\nfurniture) become dirty in the metropolis,” say they, “as compared with\r\nthe time that elapses before a proportionate amount of deterioration\r\nand uncleanliness is communicated in the rural districts, will warrant\r\nthe estimate, that _full one-half the expense of washing to maintain a\r\npassable degree of cleanliness_, is rendered necessary by the excess\r\nof smoke generated in open fires, and the _excess of dust arising from\r\nthe imperfect scavenging of the roads and streets_. Persons engaged in\r\nwashing linen on a large scale, state that it is dirtied in the crowded\r\nparts of the metropolis in _one-third_ the time in which the like\r\ndegree of uncleanliness would be produced in a rural district; but all\r\nattest the fact, that linen is more rapidly destroyed by washing than\r\nby the wear on the person. The expense of the more rapid destruction\r\nof linen must be added to the extra expense of washing. These expenses\r\nand inconveniences, the greater portion of which are due to _local\r\nmaladministration, occasion an extra expenditure of upwards of two to\r\nthree millions per annum_--exclusive of the injury done to the general\r\nhealth and the medical and other expenses consequent thereon.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find the evil effects of the imperfect scavenging of the\r\nmetropolis estimated at between two and three millions sterling per\r\nannum, and this in the mere matter of extra washing and its necessary\r\nconcomitant extra wear and tear of clothes.\r\n\r\nAs this estimate, however, appears to me to exaggerate the evil beyond\r\nall due bounds, I will proceed to adduce a few facts, bearing upon the\r\npoint: and first as to the expense of washing.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain as accurately as possible, the actual washing\r\nexpenses of labouring men and their families whose washing was done at\r\nhome, Mr. John Bullar, the Honorary Secretary to the Association for\r\nthe Promotion of Baths and Washhouses, tells us in a Report presented\r\nto Parliament, “that inquiries were made of several hundred families\r\nof labouring men, and it was found that, _taking the wife’s labour\r\nas worth 5s. a week!_ the total cost of washing at home, for a man\r\nand wife and four children, averaged very closely on 2_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nweek, = 5_d._ a head. The cost of coals, soda, soap, starch, blue, and\r\nsometimes water, was rather less than one-third of the amount. The\r\ntime occupied was rarely less than two days, and more often extended\r\ninto a third day, so that the value of the labour was rather more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the amount.\r\n\r\n“The cost of washing to single men among the labouring classes, whose\r\nwashing expenditure might be expected to be on a very low scale, such\r\nas hod-men and street-sweepers, was found to be 4-1/2_d._ a head.\r\n\r\n“The cost of washing to very small tradesmen could not be safely\r\nestimated at much more than 6_d._ a head a week.\r\n\r\n“It may, perhaps,” continues the Report, “be safe to reckon the\r\nweekly washing expenses of the poorer half of the inhabitants of the\r\nmetropolis at not exceeding 6_d._ a head; but the expenditure for\r\nwashing rapidly increases as the inquiry ascends into what are called\r\nthe ‘middle classes.’\r\n\r\n“The washing expenses of families in which servants are employed may be\r\nconsidered as double that of the servants’, and, therefore, as ranging\r\nfrom 1_s._ 6_d._ to 5_s._ a week a head.\r\n\r\n“There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining with any exactness\r\nthe washing expenditure of private families, but the conclusion is\r\nthat, taking the whole population, the washing bills of London are\r\nnearly 1_s._ a week a head, or 5,000,000_l._ a year.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” adds Mr. Bullar, “I give this as but a rough estimate, and\r\nmany exceptions may easily be taken to it; but I feel pretty confident\r\nthat _it is not very far_ from the truth.”\r\n\r\nAs I before stated, I am in no way disposed to go to the extent of\r\nthe calculation here made. It appears to me that in parliamentary\r\ninvestigations by the agency of select committees, or by gentlemen\r\nappointed to report on any subject, there is an aptitude to deal with\r\nthe whole body of the people as if they were earning the wages of well\r\nand regularly-employed labourers, or even mechanics. To suppose that\r\nthe starving ballast-heaver, the victim of a vicious truck system,\r\nwhich condemns him to poverty and drunkenness, or the sweep, or the\r\ndustman, or the street-seller--all very numerous classes--expends 1_s._\r\na week in his washing, is far beyond the fact. Still less is expended\r\nin the washing of these people’s children. Even the well-conducted\r\nartizan, with two clean shirts a week (costing him 6_d._), with the\r\nwashing of stockings, &c. (costing 1_d._ or 2_d._), does not expend\r\n1_s._ a week; so that, though the washing bills of many ladies and of\r\nsome gentlemen may average 10_s._ weekly, if we consider how few are\r\nrich and how many poor, the extra payment seems insufficient to make up\r\nthe average of the weekly shilling for the washing of all classes.\r\n\r\nA prosperous and respectable master greengrocer, who was what may\r\nbe called “particular” in his dress, as he had been a gentleman’s\r\nservant, and was now in the habit of waiting upon the wealthy persons\r\nin his neighbourhood, told me that the following was the average of\r\nhis washing bill. He was a bachelor; all his washing was put out, and\r\nhe considered his expenditure far _above_ the average of his class,\r\nas many used no night-shirt, but slept in the shirts they wore during\r\nthe day, and paid only 3_d._, and even less, per shirt to their\r\nwasher-woman, and perhaps, and more especially in winter, made one\r\nshirt last the week.\r\n\r\n  Two shirts (per week)                     7_d._\r\n  Stockings                                 1\r\n  Night-shirt (worn two weeks generally,\r\n    average per week)                       0-3/4\r\n  Sheets, blankets, and other household\r\n    linens or woollens                      2\r\n  Handkerchiefs                             0-1/4\r\n                                           ------\r\n                                           11_d._\r\n\r\nMy informant was satisfied that he had put his expenditure at the\r\nhighest. I also ascertained that an industrious wife, who was able\r\nto attend to her household matters, could wash the clothes of a\r\nsmall tradesman’s family,--for a man, his wife, and four small\r\nchildren,--“well,” at the following rate:--\r\n\r\n  1 lb. soap              4-1/2_d._ or 5_d._\r\n  Soda and starch         0-1/2\r\n  1/4 cwt. coals (extra)  3-1/2\r\n                          -----\r\n                          8-1/2_d._\r\n\r\nor less than 1-1/2_d._ per head.\r\n\r\nIn this calculation it will be seen the cheapest soap is reckoned, and\r\nthat _there is no allowance for the wife’s labour_. When I pointed out\r\nthe latter circumstance, my informant said: “I look on it that the\r\nwashing labour is part of the wife’s keep, or what she gives in return\r\nfor it; and that as she’d have to be kept if she didn’t do it, why\r\nthere shouldn’t be no mention of it. If she was working for others it\r\nwould be quite different, but washing is a family matter; that’s my way\r\nof looking at it. Coke, too, is often used instead of coals; besides, a\r\nbit of bacon, or potatoes, or the tea-kettle, will have to be boiled,\r\nand that’s managed along with the hot water for the suds, and would\r\nhave to be done anyhow, especially in winter.”\r\n\r\nOne decent woman, who had five children, “all under eight,” told me she\r\noften sat up half, and sometimes the whole night to wash, when busy\r\nother ways. She was not in poverty, for she earned “a good bit” in\r\ngoing out to cook, and her husband was employed by a pork-butcher.\r\n\r\nI may further add, that a great many single men wash their own clothes.\r\nMany of the street-sellers in particular do this; so do such of the\r\npoor as live in their own rooms, and occasionally the dwellers in the\r\nlow lodging-houses. One street-seller of ham sandwiches, whose aprons,\r\nsleeves, and tray-cloth, were remarkably white, told me that he washed\r\nthem himself, as well as his shirt, &c., and that it was the common\r\npractice with his class. This washing--his aprons, tray-cloths, shirts,\r\nand stockings included--cost him, every three weeks, 4-1/4_d._ or 5_d._\r\nfor 1 lb. of soap, which is less than 1-1/2_d._ a week. Among such\r\npeople it is considered that the washing of a shirt is, as they say, “a\r\npenn’orth of soap, and the stockings in,” meaning that a penny outlay\r\nis sufficient to wash for both.\r\n\r\nBut not only does Mr. Bullar’s estimate exceed the truth as regards\r\nthe cost of washing among the poorer classes, but it also errs in\r\nthe proportion they are said to bear to the other ranks of society.\r\nThat gentleman speaks of “the poorer _half_ of the inhabitants of the\r\nmetropolis,” as if the rich and poor were equal in numbers! but with\r\nall deference, it will be found that the ratio between the well-to-do\r\nand the needy is as 1 to 2, that is to say, the property and income-tax\r\nreturns teach us there are at least two persons with an income _below_\r\n150_l._ per annum, to every one having an income _above_ it. Hence, the\r\npopulation of London being, within a fraction, 2,400,000; the numbers\r\nof the metropolitan well-to-do and needy would be respectively 800,000\r\nand 1,600,000, and, allowing the cost of the washing of the former to\r\naverage 1_s._ per head (adults and children), and, the washing of the\r\nlabouring classes to come to 2_d._ a head, young and old (the expense\r\nof the materials, when the work is done at home, average, it has been\r\nshown, about 1-1/2_d._ for each member of the family), we shall then\r\nhave the following statement:--\r\n\r\n  Annual cost of washing for 800,000\r\n    people, at 1_s._ per head per week   £2,080,000\r\n  Annual cost of washing for 1,600,000\r\n    people, at 2_d._ per head per week      693,333\r\n                                        -----------\r\n  Total cost of washing of metropolis    £2,773,333\r\n\r\nI am convinced, low as the estimate of 2_d._ a week may appear for\r\nall whose incomes are under 150_l._ a year, from many considerations,\r\nthat the above computation is rather over than under the truth. As,\r\nfor instance, Mr. Hawes has said concerning the consumption of soap in\r\nthe metropolis,--“Careful inquiry has proved that the quantity used is\r\nmuch greater than that indicated by the Excise returns; but reducing\r\nthe results obtained by inquiry in one uniform proportion, the quantity\r\nused by the labouring classes earning from 10_s._ to 30_s._ per week\r\nis 10 lbs. each per annum, including every member of the family.\r\nDividing the population of the metropolis into three classes: (1) the\r\nwealthy; (2) the shopkeepers and tradesmen; (3) labourers and the poor,\r\nand allowing 15 lbs., 10 lbs., and 4 lbs. to each respectively, the\r\nconsumption of the metropolis will be nearly 200 tons per week.” The\r\ncost of each ton of soap Mr. Hawes estimates at 45_l._\r\n\r\nProfessor Clarke, however, computes the metropolitan consumption of\r\nsoap at 250 tons per week, and the cost per ton at 50_l._\r\n\r\n  According to the above estimates,\r\n  the total quantity of soap used every\r\n  year in the metropolis is 12,000 tons,\r\n  and this, at 50_l._ per ton, comes to        £600,000\r\n\r\n  Professor Clarke reckons the gross\r\n  consumption of soda in the metropolis,\r\n  at 250 tons per month, costing 10_l._ a\r\n  ton; hence for the year the consumption\r\n  will be 3000 tons, costing                     30,000\r\n\r\n  The cost of water, according to the\r\n  same authority, is 3_s._ 4_d._ per head\r\n  per annum, and this, for the whole\r\n  metropolis, amounts to                        400,000\r\n\r\n  Estimating the cost of the coals used\r\n  in heating the water to be equal to\r\n  that of the soap, we have for the\r\n  gross expense of fuel annually consumed\r\n  in washing                                    600,000\r\n\r\n  There are 21,000 laundresses in\r\n  London, and, calculating that the\r\n  wages of these average 10_s._ a week\r\n  each all the year round, the gross\r\n  sum paid to them, would be in\r\n  round numbers                                 550,000\r\n\r\n  Profit of employers, say                      550,000\r\n\r\n  Add for sundries, as starch, &c.               50,000\r\n                                             ----------\r\n  Total cost of washing of metropolis        £2,780,000\r\n\r\nHence it would appear, that viewed either by the individual expense\r\nof the great bulk of society, or else by the aggregate cost of the\r\nmaterials and labour used in cleansing the clothes of the people\r\nof London, the total sum annually expended in the washing of the\r\nmetropolis may be estimated at the outside at two millions and three\r\nquarters sterling per annum, or about 1_l._ 3_s._ 4_d._ per head.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, though the data for the calculation here given, as to the\r\ncost and quantity of the principal materials used in cleansing the\r\nclothes of London, are derived from the same Report as that in which\r\nthe expense of the metropolitan washing is estimated at 5,000,000_l._\r\nper annum, the Board of Health do not hesitate in that document to\r\nsay that,--“Of the fairness of the estimate of the expense of washing\r\nto the higher and middle classes, and to the great bulk of the\r\nhouseholders, and the better class of artizans, we entertain no doubt\r\nwhatever. Whatsoever deductions, if any, may be made from the above\r\nestimate, it is, nevertheless, an _under-estimate_ for maintaining,\r\nat the present expense of washing, a proper amount of cleanliness in\r\nlinen.”\r\n\r\nProceeding, however, with the calculation as to the loss from the\r\nimperfect scavenging of the metropolis, we have the following results:--\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS FROM DUST AND DIRT IN THE STREETS OF THE METROPOLIS, OWING TO THE\r\nEXTRA WASHING ENTAILED THEREBY.\r\n\r\n  According to the Board of Health,\r\n  taking the yearly amount of the washing\r\n  of the metropolis at 5,000,000_l._,\r\n  and assuming the washing to be\r\n  doubled by street-dirt, the loss will be    £2,500,000\r\n\r\n  Calculating the washing, however,\r\n  for reasons above adduced, to be only\r\n  2,750,000_l._, and to be as much again\r\n  as it might be under an improved\r\n  system of scavenging, the loss will be       1,375,000\r\n\r\n  Or calculating, _as a minimum_, that\r\n  the remediable loss is less than one-half,\r\n  the cost is                                 £1,000,000\r\n\r\nHence it would appear that the loss from dust and dirt is _really\r\nenormous_.\r\n\r\nIn a work entitled “Sanatory Progress,” being the Fifth Report of the\r\nNational Philanthropic Association, I find a calculation as to the\r\nlosses sustained from dust and dirt upon our clothes. Owing to the\r\nincreased wear from daily brushing to remove the dust, and occasional\r\nscraping to remove the mud, the loss is estimated at from 3_l._ to\r\n7_l._ per annum for each well-dressed man and woman, and 1_l._ for\r\ninferiorly-dressed persons, including their Sunday and holiday clothing.\r\n\r\nI inquired of a West-end tailor, who previously to his establishment in\r\nbusiness had himself been an operative, and had had experience both in\r\ntown and country as to the wear of clothes, and I learned from him the\r\nfollowing particulars.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the clothes of the wealthy classes, of those who could\r\nalways command a carriage in bad weather, there are no means of judging\r\nas to the loss caused by bad scavengery.\r\n\r\nMy informant, however, obliged me with the following calculations,\r\nthe results of his experience. His trade is what I may describe as a\r\nmedium business, between the low slop and the high fashionable trades.\r\nThe garments of which he spoke were those worn by clerks, shopmen,\r\nstudents, tradesmen, town-travellers, and others not engaged in menial\r\nor handicraft labour.\r\n\r\nAltogether, and after consulting his books relative to town and country\r\ncustomers, my informant thought it might be easy to substantiate the\r\nfollowing estimate as regards the duration and cost of clothes in town\r\nand country among the classes I have specified.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE COMPARATIVE COST OF CLOTHES WORN IN TOWN AND COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n  ----------+--------------+----------------------+----------------------+-------------\r\n            |              |         Town.        |       Country.       |\r\n  Garments. |Original cost.+---------+------------+---------+------------+Difference of\r\n            |              |Duration.|Annual cost.|Duration.|Annual cost.|    cost.\r\n  ----------+--------------+---------+------------+---------+------------+-------------\r\n            |  £ _s._ _d._ |  Years. | £ _s._ _d._|  Years. | £ _s._ _d._|  £ _s._ _d._\r\n  Coat      |  2  10   0   |  2      | 1   5   0  |    3    | 0  16   8  |  0   8   4\r\n  Waistcoat |  0  15   0   |  2-1/2  | 0   6   0  |    3    | 0   5   0  |  0   1   0\r\n  Trowsers  |  1   5   0   |  1-1/4  | 1   0   0  |    2    | 0  12   6  |  0   7   6\r\n  ----------+--------------+---------+------------+---------+------------+-------------\r\n  Total Suit|  4  10   0   |         | 2  11   0  |         | 1  14   2  |  0  16  10\r\n  ----------+--------------+---------+------------+---------+------------+-------------\r\n\r\nHere, then, it appears that the annual outlay for clothes in town, by\r\nthe classes I have specified, is about 2_l._ 11_s._; while the annual\r\noutlay in the country for the same garments is 1_l._ 14_s._ 2_d._;\r\nthe difference of expense being 16_s._ 10_d._ per annum. I consulted\r\nanother tailor on the subject, and his estimate was a trifle above that\r\nof my informant.\r\n\r\nI should remark that the proportion thus adduced holds, _whatever be\r\nthe number of garments_ worn in the year, or in a series of years,\r\nfor the calculation was made not as to individual garments, but as\r\nto the general wear, evinced by the average outlay, as shown in the\r\ntradesman’s books, of the same class of persons in town and country.\r\n\r\nIn the calculation given in the publication of the National\r\nPhilanthropic Association, the loss on a well-dressed Londoner’s\r\nclothing, arising from excessive dust and dirt, is estimated at from\r\n3_l._ to 7_l._ per annum. By the above table it will be seen that the\r\nclothes which cost 1_l._ 14_s._ 2_d._ per annum in the cleanliness of\r\na country abode, cost 2_l._ 11_s._, or, within a fraction, half as\r\nmuch again, in the uncleanliness of a London atmosphere and roads. If,\r\ntherefore, any London inhabitant, of the classes I have specified,\r\nexpend four times 2_l._ 11_s._ in his clothes yearly, as many do, or\r\n10_l._ 4_s._, he loses 3_l._ 5_s._ 4_d._, or 5_s._ 4_d._ more than the\r\nminimum mentioned in the Report alluded to.\r\n\r\nNow estimating 2_l._ 10_s._ as the yearly tailor’s bill among the\r\nwell-to-do (boys and men), and calculating that one-sixth of the\r\nmetropolitan population (that is, half of the one-third who may be said\r\nto belong to the class having incomes above 150_l._ a year) spend this\r\nsum yearly in clothes, we have the following statement:--\r\n\r\n\r\nAGGREGATE LOSS UPON CLOTHES WORN IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n                                        £     _s._  _d._\r\n\r\n  400,000 persons living in\r\n  London expend in clothing (at\r\n  2_l._ 10_s._ per annum)           1,000,000   0    0\r\n\r\n  400,000 persons living in better\r\n  atmospheres in rural parts,\r\n  and with the same stock of\r\n  clothes, expend one-third less,\r\n  or                                  666,666  13    4\r\n                                    ------------------\r\n                         Difference   333,333   6    8\r\n\r\nIt would be pushing the inquiry to exceeding minuteness were I to enter\r\ninto calculations as to the comparative expense of boots, hats, and\r\nladies’ dresses worn in town and country; suffice it, that competent\r\npersons in each of the vestiary trades have been seen, and averages\r\ndrawn for the accounts of their town and country customers.\r\n\r\nAll things, then, being duly considered, the following conclusion would\r\nseem to be warranted by the facts:--\r\n\r\n  Annual cost of clothes to 800,000 of\r\n  the metropolitan population (those\r\n  belonging to the class who have incomes\r\n  _above_ 150_l._ per annum) at 4_l._\r\n  per year each                            £3,200,000\r\n\r\n  Annual cost of clothes to 1,600,000\r\n  of the metropolitan population (those\r\n  belonging to the class who have incomes\r\n  _below_ 150_l._ per annum), at 1_l._\r\n  per year each                             1,600,000\r\n                                           ----------\r\n                                           £4,800,000\r\n\r\n  Annual cost of the same clothes if\r\n  worn in the country                       3,600,000\r\n                                           ----------\r\n  Extra expense annually entailed by\r\n  dust and dirt of metropolis              £1,200,000\r\n\r\nIn the above estimate I have included the cost of wear and tear of\r\nlinen from extra washing when worn in London, and this has been stated\r\non the authority of the Board of Health to be double that of linen worn\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I may cite the following curious\r\ncalculation, taken from a Parliamentary Report, as to the cost of a\r\nworking man’s new shirt, comprising four yards of strong calico.\r\n\r\n  _Material._--Cotton at 6_d._ per lb.    _d._\r\n    1-1/4 lb., with loss thereupon        8·25\r\n\r\n  _Manufacture_,--              _d._\r\n        Spinning                2·25\r\n        Weaving                 3·00\r\n        Profit                   ·25\r\n                               -----\r\n                                          5·50\r\n                                         -----\r\n                                         13·75\r\n                  Bleaching about         1·25\r\n                                         -----\r\n                                         15·00\r\n\r\n  Grey (calico) 13·75_d._ + 9_d._ (making) = 1_s._ 10-3/4_d._\r\n  Bleached       15_d._   + 9_d._    „     = 2_s._\r\n\r\nAs regards the loss and damage occasioned by the injury to\r\nhousehold furniture and decorations, and to stocks-in-trade, which\r\nis another important consideration connected with this subject, I\r\nfind the following statement in the Report of the Philanthropic\r\nInstitution:--“The loss by goods and furniture is incalculable:\r\nshopkeepers lose from 10_l._ to 150_l._ a-year by the spoiling of\r\ntheir goods for sale; dealers in provisions especially, who cannot\r\nexpose them without being deteriorated in value, from the dust that is\r\nincessantly settling upon them. Nor is it much better with clothiers of\r\nall kinds:--Mr. Holmes, shawl merchant, in Regent-street, has stated\r\nthat his losses from road-dust alone exceed 150_l._ per annum.”...\r\n“In a communication with Mr. Mivart, respecting the expenses of mud\r\nand road-dust to him, that gentleman stated that the rent of the four\r\nhouses of which his hotel is composed, was 896_l._; and that he could\r\nnot (considering the cost of cleaning and servants) estimate the\r\nexpense of repairing the damage done by the dirt and dust, carried and\r\nblown into these houses, at a less annual sum than that of his rent!”\r\n\r\nAn upholsterer obliged me with the following calculations, but so many\r\nwere the materials, and so different the rates of wear or the liability\r\nto injury in different materials in his trade, that he could only\r\ncalculate generally.\r\n\r\nThe same quality, colour, and pattern of curtains, silk damasks, which\r\nhe had furnished to a house in town, and to a country house belonging\r\nto the same gentleman, looked far fresher and better after five years’\r\nwear in the country than after three in town. Both windows had a\r\nsouthern aspect, but the occupant would have his windows partially\r\nopen unless the weather was cold, foggy, or rainy. It was the same,\r\nor nearly the same, he thought, with the carpets on the two places,\r\nfor London dust was highly injurious to all the better qualities\r\nof carpets. He was satisfied, also, it was the same generally in\r\nupholstery work subjected to town dust.\r\n\r\nI inquired at several West-end and city shops, and of different\r\ndescriptions of tradesmen, of the injury done to their shop and\r\nshop-window goods by the dust, but I found none who had made any\r\ncalculations on the subject. All, however, agreed that the dust was an\r\nexcessive annoyance, and entailed great expense; a ladies’ shoemaker\r\nand a bookseller expressed this particularly--on the necessity of\r\nmaking the window a sort of small glass-house to exclude the dust,\r\nwhich, after all, was not sufficiently excluded. All thought, or with\r\nbut one hesitating exception, that the estimation as to the loss\r\nsustained by the Messrs. Holmes, considering the extent of their\r\npremises, and the richness of the goods displayed in the windows, &c.,\r\nwas not in excess.\r\n\r\nI can, then, but indicate the injury to household furniture and\r\nstock-in-trade as a corroboration of all that has been advanced\r\ntouching the damaging effects of road dirt.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HORSE-DUNG OF THE STREETS OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n“Familiarity with streets of crowded traffic deadens the senses to the\r\nperception of their actual condition. Strangers coming from the country\r\nfrequently describe the streets of London as smelling of dung like a\r\nstable-yard.”\r\n\r\nSuch is one of the statements in a Report submitted to Parliament, and\r\nthere is no reason to doubt the fact. Every English visitor to a French\r\ncity, for instance, must have detected street-odours of which the\r\ninhabitants were utterly unconscious. In a work which between 20 and\r\n30 years ago was deservedly popular, Mathews’s “Diary of an Invalid,”\r\nit is mentioned that an English lady complaining of the villanous\r\nrankness of the air in the first French town she entered--Calais, if I\r\nremember rightly--received the comfortable assurance, “It is the smell\r\nof the Continent, ma’am.” Even in Cologne itself, the “most stinking\r\ncity of Europe,” as it has been termed, the citizens are insensible\r\nto the foul airs of their streets, and yet possess great skill in\r\nmanufacturing perfumed and distilled waters for the toilet, pluming\r\nthemselves on the delicacy and discrimination of their nasal organs.\r\nWhat we perceive in other cities, as strangers, those who visit London\r\ndetect in our streets--that they smell of dung like stable-yards. It\r\nis idle for London denizens, because they are unconscious of the fact,\r\nto deny the existence of any such effluvia. I have met with nightmen\r\nwho have told me that there was “nothing particular” in the smell of\r\nthe cesspools they were emptying; they “hardly perceived it.” One man\r\nsaid, “Why, it’s like the sort of stuff I’ve smelt in them ladies’\r\nsmelling-bottles.” An eminent tallow-melter said, in the course of his\r\nevidence before Parliament during a sanitary inquiry, that the smell\r\nfrom the tallow-melting on his premises was not only healthful and\r\nreviving--for invalids came to inhale it--but agreeable. I mention\r\nthese facts to meet the scepticism which the official assertion as\r\nto the stable-like odour of the streets may, perhaps, provoke. When,\r\nhowever, I state the _quantity_ of horse-dung and “cattle-droppings”\r\nvoided in the streets, all incredulity, I doubt not, will be removed.\r\n\r\n“It has been ascertained,” says the Report of the National\r\nPhilanthropic Association, “that four-fifths of the street-dirt consist\r\nof horse and cattle-droppings.”\r\n\r\nLet us, therefore, endeavour to arrive at definite notions as to the\r\nabsolute quantity of this element of street-dirt.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, as to the number of cattle and horses traversing the\r\nstreets of London.\r\n\r\nIn the course of an inquiry in November, 1850, into Smithfield-market,\r\nI adduced the following results as to the number of cattle entering the\r\nmetropolis, deriving the information from the experience of Mr. Deputy\r\nHicks, confirmed by returns to Parliament, by the amount of tolls, and\r\nfurther ratified by the opinion of some of the most experienced “live\r\nsalesmen” and “dead salesmen” (sellers on commission of live and dead\r\ncattle), whose assistance I had the pleasure of obtaining.\r\n\r\nThe return is of the stock _annually_ sold in Smithfield-market, and\r\nincludes not only English but foreign beasts, sheep, and calves; the\r\nlatter averaging weekly in 1848 (the latest return then published),\r\nbeasts, 590; sheep, 2478; and calves, 248.\r\n\r\n              224,000 horned cattle.\r\n            1,550,000 sheep.\r\n               27,300 calves.\r\n               40,000 pigs.\r\n            ---------\r\n  Total     1,841,300.\r\n\r\nI may remark that this is not a criterion of the consumption of animal\r\nfood in the metropolis, for there are, besides the above, the daily\r\nsupplies from the country to the “dead salesmen.” The preceding return,\r\nhowever, is sufficient for my present purpose, which is to show the\r\nquantity of cattle manure “dropped” in London.\r\n\r\nThe number of cattle entering the metropolis, then, are 1,841,300 per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nThe number of horses daily traversing the metropolis has been already\r\nset forth. By a return obtained by Mr. Charles Cochrane from the Stamp\r\nand Tax Office, we have seen that there are altogether\r\n\r\n  In London and Westminster, of private\r\n    carriage, job, and cart horses        10,022\r\n  Cab horses                               5,692\r\n  Omnibus horses                           5,500\r\n  Horses daily coming to metropolis        3,000\r\n                                          ------\r\n  Total number of horses daily in London  24,214\r\n\r\nThe total here given includes the returns of horses which were either\r\ntaxed or the property of those who employ them in hackney-carriages\r\nin the metropolis. But the whole of these 24,214 horses are not at\r\nwork in the streets every day. Perhaps it might be an approximation to\r\nthe truth, if we reckoned five-sixths of the horses as being worked\r\nregularly in the public thoroughfares; so that we arrive at the\r\nconclusion that 20,000 horses are daily worked in the metropolis; and\r\nhence we have an aggregate of 7,300,000 horses traversing the streets\r\nof London in the twelvemonth. The beasts, sheep, calves, and pigs\r\ndriven and conveyed to and from Smithfield are, we have seen, 1,841,300\r\nin number. These, added together, make up a total of 9,141,300 animals\r\nappearing annually in the London thoroughfares. The circumstance of\r\nSmithfield cattle-market being held but twice a week in no way detracts\r\nfrom the amount here given; for as the gross number of individual\r\ncattle coming to that market in the course of the year is given, each\r\nanimal is estimated as appearing only once in the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe next point for consideration is--what is the quantity of dung\r\ndropped by each of the above animals while in the public thoroughfares?\r\n\r\nConcerning the quantity of excretions passed by a horse in the\r\ncourse of 24 hours there have been some valuable experiments made by\r\nphilosophers whose names alone are a sufficient guarantee for the\r\naccuracy of their researches.\r\n\r\nThe following Table from Boussingault’s experiments is copied from the\r\n“Annales de Chimie et de Physique,” t. lxxi.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD CONSUMED BY AND EXCRETIONS OF A HORSE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------++---------------------------------------\r\n                  FOOD.                 ||               EXCRETIONS.\r\n  ------+--------------+----------------++------------+--------------+-----------\r\n        |  Weight in a |   Weight in a  ||            |  Weight in a |Weight in a\r\n        |fresh state in|   fresh state  ||            |fresh state in|fresh state\r\n        |   grammes.   |    in pounds.  ||            |    grammes.  | in pounds.\r\n  ------+--------------+----------------++------------+--------------+-----------\r\n        |              | lbs. oz.       ||            |              |  lbs. oz.\r\n  Hay   | 7,500        |  20   0        || Excrements |    14,250    |   38   2\r\n  Oats  | 2,270        |   6   1        || Urine      |     1,330    |    3   7\r\n        |       ------ |         ------ ||            |              |\r\n        |        9,770 |         26   1 ||            |              |\r\n  Water |       16,000 |         42  10 ||            |              |\r\n  ------+--------------+----------------++------------+--------------+-----------\r\n  Total |       25,770 |         68  11 || Total      |    15,580    |   41   9\r\n  ------+--------------+----------------++------------+--------------+-----------\r\n\r\nHere it will be seen that the quantity of solid food given to the\r\nhorse in the course of the 24 hours amounted only to 26 lbs.; whereas\r\nit is stated in the Report of the National Philanthropic Association,\r\non the authority of the veterinary surgeon to the Life Guards, that\r\nthe regulation horse rations in all cavalry regiments is 30 lbs. of\r\nsolid food; viz., 10 lbs. of oats, 12 lbs. of hay, together with 8 lbs.\r\nof straw, for the horse to lie upon and munch at his leisure. “This\r\nquantity of solid food, with five gallons of water, is considered\r\nsufficient,” we are told, “for all regimental horses, who have but\r\nlittle work to perform, in comparison with the draught horses of the\r\nmetropolis, many of which consume daily 35 lbs. and upwards of solid\r\nfood, with at least six gallons of water.\r\n\r\n“At a conference held with the secretary and professors of the\r\nVeterinary College in College-street, Camden-town,” continues the\r\nReport, “those gentlemen kindly undertook to institute a series of\r\nexperiments in this department of equine physiology; the subject\r\nbeing one which interested themselves, professionally, as well as the\r\ncouncil of the National Philanthropic Association. The experiments were\r\ncarefully conducted under the superintendence of Professor Varnell. The\r\nfood, drink, and voidances of several horses, kept in stable all day\r\nlong, were separately weighed and measured; and the following were the\r\nresults with an animal of medium size and sound health:--\r\n\r\n  “‘Royal Veterinary College,\r\n  Sept. 29, 1849.\r\n\r\n  “‘Brown horse of middle size ate in\r\n  24 hours, of hay, 16lbs.; oats, 10lbs.;\r\n  chaff, 4 lbs.; in all                      30 lbs.\r\n\r\n  Drank of water, in 24 hours, 6 gallons,\r\n  or                                         48 lbs.\r\n                                            --------\r\n                        Total                78 lbs.\r\n  Voided in the form of fæces                49 lbs.\r\n                                            --------\r\n  Allowance for nutrition, supply of\r\n  waste in system, perspiration, and urine   29 lbs.\r\n\r\n  (Signed)\r\n  “‘GEORGE VARNELL,\r\n  “‘Demonstrator of Anatomy.’”\r\n\r\nHere we find the excretions to be 11 lbs. more than those of the French\r\nhorse experimented upon by M. Boussingault; but then the solid food\r\ngiven to the English horse was 4 lbs. more, and the liquid upwards of 7\r\nlbs. extra.\r\n\r\nWe may then, perhaps, assume, without fear of erring, that the\r\nexcrements voided by horses in the course of 24 hours, weigh, at the\r\nleast, 45 lbs.\r\n\r\nHence the gross quantity of dung produced by the 7,300,000 horses which\r\ntraverse the London streets in the course of the twelvemonth will be\r\n7,300,000 × 45, or 328,500,000 lbs., which is upwards of 146,651 tons.\r\nBut these horses cannot be said to be at work above six hours each day;\r\nwe must, therefore, divide the above quantity by four, and thus we\r\nfind that there are 36,662 tons of horse-dung annually dropped in the\r\nstreets of London.\r\n\r\nI am informed, on good authority, that the evacuations of an ox, in\r\n24 hours, will, on the average, exceed those of a horse in weight by\r\nabout a fifteenth, while, if the ox be disturbed by being driven, the\r\nexcretions will exceed the horse’s by about a twelfth. As the oxen are\r\nnot driven in the streets, or detained in the market for so long a\r\nperiod as horses are out at work, it may be fair to compute that their\r\ndroppings are about the same, individually, as those of the horses.\r\n\r\nHence, as there are 224,000 horned cattle yearly brought to London, we\r\nhave 224,000 × 45 lbs. = 10,080,000 lbs., or 4500 tons, for the gross\r\nquantity of ordure dropped by this number of animals in the course of\r\n24 hours, so that, dividing by 4, as before, we find that there are\r\n1125 tons of ordure annually dropped by the “horned cattle” in the\r\nstreets of London.\r\n\r\nConcerning the sheep, I am told that it may be computed that the\r\nordure of five sheep is about equal in weight to that of two oxen. As\r\nregards the other animals it may be said that their “droppings” are\r\ninsignificant, the pigs and calves being very generally carted to and\r\nfrom the market, as, indeed, are some of the fatter and more valuable\r\nsheep and lambs. All these facts being taken into consideration, I am\r\ntold, by a regular frequenter of Smithfield market, that it will be\r\nbest to calculate the droppings of each of the 1,617,300 sheep, calves,\r\nand pigs yearly coming to the metropolis at about one-fourth of those\r\nof the horned cattle; so that multiplying 1,617,300 by 10, instead of\r\n45, we have 16,173,000 lbs., or 7220 tons, for the weight of ordure\r\ndeposited by the entire number of sheep, calves, and pigs annually\r\nbrought to the metropolis, and then dividing this by 4, as usual, we\r\nfind that the droppings of the calves, sheep, and pigs in the streets\r\nof London amount to 1805 tons per annum.\r\n\r\nNow putting together all the preceding items we obtain the following\r\nresults:--\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSS WEIGHT OF THE HORSE-DUNG AND CATTLE-DROPPINGS ANNUALLY DEPOSITED\r\nIN THE STREETS OF LONDON:--\r\n\r\n                                         Tons.\r\n  Horse-dung                            36,662\r\n  Droppings of horned cattle             1,125\r\n  Droppings of sheep, calves, and pigs   1,805\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                        39,592\r\n\r\nHence we perceive that the gross weight of animal excretions dropped\r\nin the public thoroughfares of the metropolis is about 40,000 tons per\r\nannum, or, in round numbers, 770 tons every week-day--say 100 tons a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis, I am well aware, is a low estimate, but it appears to me that\r\nthe facts will not warrant any other conclusion. And yet the Board of\r\nHealth, who seem to delight in “large” estimates, represent the amount\r\nof animal manure deposited in the streets of London at no less than\r\n200,000 tons per annum.\r\n\r\n“Between the Quadrant in Regent-street and Oxford-street,” says the\r\nfirst Report on the Supply of Water to the Metropolis, “a distance of\r\na third of a mile, three loads, on the average, of dirt, almost all\r\nhorse-dung, are removed daily. On an estimate made from the working\r\nof the street-sweeping machine, in one quarter of the City of London,\r\nwhich includes lines of considerable traffic, the quantity of dung\r\ndropped must be upwards of 60 tons, or about 20,000 tons per annum,\r\nand this, on a City district, which comprises about one-twentieth only\r\nof the covered area of the metropolis, though within that area there\r\nis the greatest proportionate amount of traffic. Though the data are\r\nextremely imperfect, it is considered that the horse-dung which falls\r\nin the streets of the whole metropolis _cannot be less than 200,000\r\ntons a year_.”\r\n\r\nHence, although the data are imperfect, the Board of Health do not\r\nhesitate to conclude that the gross quantity of horse-dung dropped\r\nthroughout every part of London--back streets and all--is equal to\r\none-half of that let fall in the greatest London thoroughfares.\r\nAccording to this estimate, all and every of the 24,000 London horses\r\nmust void, in the course of the six hours that they are at work in the\r\nstreets, not less than 51 lbs. of excrement, which is at the rate of\r\nvery nearly 2 cwt. in the course of the day, or voiding only 49 lbs.\r\nin the twenty-four hours, they must remain out altogether, and never\r\nreturn to the stable for rest!!!\r\n\r\nMr. Cochrane is far less hazardous than the Board of Health, and\r\nappears to me to arrive at his result in a more scientific and\r\nconclusive manner. He goes first to the Stamp Office to ascertain the\r\nnumber of horses in the metropolis, and then requests the professors\r\nof the Veterinary College to estimate the average quantity of\r\nexcretions produced by a horse in the course of 24 hours. All this\r\naccords with the soundest principles of inquiry, and stands out in\r\nstartling contrast with the unphilosophical plan pursued by the Board\r\nof Health, who obtain the result of the most crowded thoroughfare, and\r\nthen halving this, frame an exaggerated estimate for the whole of the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Cochrane himself appears to me to exceed that just caution\r\nwhich is so necessary in all statistical calculations. Having\r\nascertained that a horse voids 49 lbs. of dung in the course of 24\r\nhours, he makes the whole of the 24,214 horses in the metropolis drop\r\n30 lbs. daily in the streets, so that, according to his estimate, not\r\nonly must every horse in London be out every day, but he must be at\r\nwork in the public thoroughfares for very nearly 15 hours out of the 24!\r\n\r\nThe following is the estimate made by Mr. Cochrane:--\r\n\r\n Daily weight of manure deposited in the streets by 24,214 horses × 30\r\n lbs. = 726,420 lbs., or 324 tons, 5 cwt., 100 lbs.\r\n\r\n Weekly weight, 2270 tons, 1 cwt., 28 lbs.\r\n\r\n Annual weight, 118,043 tons, 5 cwt.\r\n\r\n Tons or cart-loads deposited annually, valued at 6_s._ × 118,043 =\r\n 35,412_l._ 19_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nIt has, then, been here shown that, assuming the number of horses\r\nworked daily in the streets of London to be 20,000, and each to be\r\nout six hours _per diem_, which, it appears to me, is all that can be\r\nfairly reckoned, the quantity of horse-dung dropped weekly is about 700\r\ntons, so that, including the horses of the cavalry regiments in London,\r\nwhich of course are not comprised in the Stamp-Office returns, as well\r\nas the animals taken to Smithfield, we may, perhaps, assert that the\r\nannual ordure let fall in the London streets amounts, at the outside,\r\nto somewhere about 1000 tons weekly, or 52,000 tons per annum.\r\n\r\nThe next question becomes--what is done with this vast amount of filth?\r\n\r\nThe Board of Health is a much better guide upon this point than\r\nupon the matter of quantity: “Much of the horse-dung dropped in the\r\nLondon streets, under ordinary circumstances,” we are told, “dries\r\nand is pulverized, and with the common soil is carried into houses as\r\ndust, and dirties clothes and furniture. The odour arising from the\r\nsurface evaporation of the streets when they are wet is chiefly from\r\nhorse-dung. Susceptible persons often feel this evaporation, after\r\npartial wetting, to be highly oppressive. The surface-water discharged\r\ninto sewers from the streets and roofs of houses is found to contain as\r\nmuch filth as the soil-water from the house-drains.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, we perceive that the whole of the animal manure let fall\r\nin the streets is worse than wasted, and yet we are assured that it is\r\nan article, which, if properly collected, is of considerable value.\r\n“It is,” says the Report of the National Philanthropic Association,\r\n“an article of Agricultural and Horticultural commerce which has\r\never maintained a high value with the farmers and market-gardeners,\r\nwherever conveniently obtainable. When these cattle-droppings can be\r\ncollected _unmixed_, in dry weather, they bear an acknowledged value\r\nby the grazier and root-grower;--there being no other kind of manure\r\nwhich fertilizes the land so bounteously. Mr. Marnock, Curator of the\r\nRoyal Botanical Society, has valued them at from 5_s._ to 10_s._ per\r\nload; according to the season of the year. The United Paving Board\r\nof St. Giles and St. George, since the introduction of the Street\r\nOrderly System into their parishes, has wisely had it collected in a\r\nstate separate from all admixture, and sold it at highly remunerative\r\nprices, rendering it the means of considerably lessening the expense of\r\ncleansing the streets.”\r\n\r\nNow, assuming the value of the street-dropped manure to be 6_s._ per\r\nton when collected free from dirt, we have the following statement as\r\nto the value of the horse and cattle-voidances let fall in the streets\r\nof London:--\r\n\r\n  52,000 tons of cattle-droppings,\r\n    at 6_s._ per ton            £15,600   0  0\r\n\r\nMr. Cochrane, who considers the quantity of animal-droppings to be much\r\ngreater, attaches of course a greater value to the aggregate quantity.\r\nHis computation is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  118,043 tons of cattle-droppings,\r\n    at 6_s._ per ton            £35,412  19  6\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the calculations of the quantity of horse and\r\ncattle-dung in the streets, are based on such well-authenticated and\r\nscientific foundations, that their accuracy can hardly be disputed,\r\nunless it be that a higher average might fairly be shown.\r\n\r\nWhatever estimate be adopted, the worth of street-dropped animal\r\nmanure, if properly secured and made properly disposable, is great and\r\nindisputable; most assuredly between 10,000_l._ and 20,000_l._ in value.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF STREET “MAC” AND OTHER MUD.\r\n\r\nFirst of that kind of mud known by the name of “mac.”\r\n\r\nThe scavengers call mud all that is _swept_ from the granite or wood\r\npavements, in contradistinction to “mac,” which is both _scraped_ and\r\nswept on the macadamized roads. The mud is usually carted apart from\r\nthe “mac,” but some contractors cause their men to shovel every kind of\r\ndirt they meet with into the same cart.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Mac Adam’s system of road-making into the streets\r\nof London called into existence a new element in what is accounted\r\nstreet refuse. Until of late years little attention was paid to\r\n“Mac,” for it was considered in no way distinct from other kinds\r\nof street-dirt, nor as being likely to possess properties which\r\nmight adapt it for any other use than that of a component part of\r\nagricultural manure.\r\n\r\n“Mac” is found principally on the roads from which it derives its name,\r\nand is, indeed, the grinding and pounding of the imbedded pieces of\r\ngranite, which are the staple of those roads. It is, perhaps, the most\r\nadhesive street-dirt known, as respects the London specimen of it; for\r\nthe exceeding traffic works and kneads it into a paste which it is\r\ndifficult to remove from the texture of any garment splashed or soiled\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n“Mac” is carted away by the scavengers in great quantities, being\r\nshovelled, in a state of more or less fluidity or solidity, according\r\nto the weather, from the road-side into their carts. Quantities are\r\nalso swept with the rain into the drains of the streets, and not\r\nunfrequently quantities are found deposited in the sewers.\r\n\r\nThe following passage from “Sanatory Progress,” a work before\r\nalluded to, cites the opinion of Lord Congleton as to the necessity\r\nof continually removing the mud from roads. I may add that Lord\r\nCongleton’s work on road-making is of high authority, and has\r\nfrequently been appealed to in parliamentary discussions, inquiries,\r\nand reports on the subject.\r\n\r\n“The late Lord Congleton (Sir Henry Parnell) stated before a Committee\r\nof the House of Commons, in June, 1838, ‘a road should be cleansed\r\nfrom time to time, so as _never_ to have half an inch of mud upon\r\nit; and this is particularly necessary to be attended to where the\r\nmaterials are _weak_; for, if the surface be not kept clean, so as\r\nto admit of its becoming dry in the intervals between showers of\r\nrain, it will be rapidly worn away.’ How truly,” adds the Report,\r\n“is his Lordship’s opinion verified every day on the macadamized\r\nroads in and around London! * * * * * * The horse-manure and other\r\nfilth are there allowed to accumulate, and to be carried about by\r\nthe horses and carriage-wheels; the road is formed into cavities and\r\nmud-hollows, which, being wetted by the rain and the constantly plying\r\n_watering-carts_, retain the same. Thus, not only are vast quantities\r\nof offensive mud formed, but puddles and _pools of water_ also; which\r\nwater, not being allowed to run off to the side gutter, by declivity,\r\nowing to the _mud embankments_ which surround it, naturally _percolates\r\nthrough the surface of the road, dissolving and loosening the soft\r\nearthy matrix_ by which the broken granite is surrounded and fixed.”\r\n\r\nThe quantity of “mac” produced is the next consideration, and\r\nin endeavouring to ascertain this there are no specific data,\r\nthough there are what, under other circumstances, might be called\r\ncircumstantial or inferential evidence.\r\n\r\nI have shown both the length of the streets and roads and the\r\nproportion which might be pronounced macadamized ways in the Metropolis\r\nProper. But as in the macadamized proportion many thoroughfares cannot\r\nbe strictly considered as yielding “mac,” I will assume that the roads\r\nand streets producing this kind of dirt, more or less fully, are 1200\r\nmiles in length.\r\n\r\nOn the busier macadamized roads in the vicinity of what may be called\r\nthe interior of London, it is common, I was told by experienced men, in\r\naverage weather, to collect daily two cart-loads of what is called mac,\r\nfrom every mile of road. The mass of such road-produce, however, is\r\nmixed, though the “mac” unquestionably predominates. It was described\r\nto me as mac, general dirt, and droppings, more than the half being\r\n“mac.” In wet weather there is at least twenty times more “mac” than\r\ndung scavenged; but in dry weather the dung and other street-refuse\r\nconstitute, perhaps, somewhat less than three-fourths of each\r\ncart-load. The “mac” in dry weather is derived chiefly from the fluid\r\nfrom the watering carts mixing with the dust, and so forming a paste\r\ncapable of being removed by the scraper of the scavenger.\r\n\r\nIt may be fair to assume that every mile of the roads in question, some\r\nof them being of considerable width, yields at least one cart-load of\r\n“mac,” as a daily average, Sunday of course excepted. An intelligent\r\nman, who had the management of the “mac” and other street collections\r\nin a contractor’s wharf, told me that in a load of “mac” carted from\r\nthe road to any place of deposit, there was (I now use his own words)\r\n“a good deal of water; for there’s great difference,” he added, “in the\r\n_stiffness_ of the “mac” on different roads, that seem very much the\r\nsame to look at. But that don’t signify a halfpenny-piece,” he said,\r\n“for if the ‘mac’ is wanted for any purpose, and let be for a little\r\ntime, you see, sir, the water will dry up, and leave the proper stuff.\r\nI haven’t any doubt whatever that two loads a mile are collected in\r\nthe way you’ve been told, and that a load and a quarter of the two is\r\n‘mac,’ though after the water is dried up out of it there mightn’t be\r\nmuch more than a load. So if you want to calculate what the quantity of\r\n‘mac’ is by itself, I think you had best say one load a mile.”\r\n\r\nBut it is only in the more frequented approaches to the City or the\r\nWest-end, such as the Knightsbridge-road, the New-road, the Old\r\nKent-road, and thoroughfares of similar character as regards the\r\nextent of traffic, that two loads of refuse are daily collected. On\r\nthe more distant roads, beyond the bounds traversed by the omnibuses\r\nfor instance, or beyond the roads resorted to by the market gardeners\r\non their way to the metropolitan “green” markets, the supply of\r\nstreet-refuse is hardly a quarter as great; one man thought it was a\r\nthird, and another only a sixth of a load a day in quiet places.\r\n\r\nCalculating then, in order to be within the mark, that the macadamized\r\nroads afford daily two loads of dirt per mile, and reckoning the great\r\nmacadamized streets at 100 miles in length, we have the following\r\nresults:--\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF STREET-REFUSE COLLECTED FROM THE MORE FREQUENTED\r\nMACADAMIZED THOROUGHFARES.\r\n\r\n                                    Loads.\r\n  100 miles, 2 loads per day          200\r\n      „      Weekly amount          1,200\r\n      „      Yearly amount         62,400\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPORTION OF “MAC” IN THE ABOVE.\r\n\r\n  100 miles, 1 load per day           100\r\n      „      Weekly                   600\r\n      „      Yearly                31,200\r\n\r\nTo this amount must be added the quantity supplied by the more\r\ndistant and less frequented roads situate within the precincts of the\r\nMetropolis Proper. These I will estimate at one-eighth less than that\r\nof the roads of greater traffic. Some of the more quiet thoroughfares,\r\nI should add, are not scavenged more than once a week, and some less\r\nfrequently; but on some there is considerable traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF STREET-REFUSE COLLECTED FROM THE LESS FREQUENTED\r\nMACADAMIZED THOROUGHFARES.\r\n\r\n                                    Loads.\r\n  1100 miles, 1/4 load per day        275\r\n       „      Weekly                1,650\r\n       „      Yearly               85,800\r\n\r\nThe proportion of mac to the gross dirt collected is greater in the\r\nmore distant roads than what I have already described, but to be safe I\r\nwill adopt the same ratio.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPORTION OF “MAC.”\r\n\r\n                                         Loads.\r\n  1100 miles of road, 1/8 load per day     137\r\n         „            Weekly               825\r\n         „            Yearly            42,900\r\n\r\n\r\nYEARLY TOTAL OF THE GROSS QUANTITY OF STREET-REFUSE, WITH THE\r\nPROPORTIONATE QUANTITY OF “MAC” COLLECTED FROM THE MACADAMIZED\r\nTHOROUGHFARES OF THE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------+-------------+---------\r\n                             |  Street     |\r\n                             |  Refuse.    |  “Mac.”\r\n  ---------------------------+-------------+---------\r\n                             | Cart-loads. |  Loads.\r\n  100 miles of macadamized   |             |\r\n    roads                    |   62,400    |  31,200\r\n  1100 miles ditto  ditto    |   85,800    |  42,900\r\n                             | --------    |  ------\r\n                             |  148,200    |  74,100\r\n  ---------------------------+-------------+---------\r\n\r\nThus upwards of 74,000 cart-loads of “mac” are, at a low computation,\r\nannually scraped and swept from the metropolitan thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far as to the _quantity_ of “mac” collected, and now as to its\r\n_uses_.\r\n\r\n“‘Mac,’ or _Macadam_,” says one of Mr. Cochrane’s Reports, “is a grand\r\nprize to the scavenging contractor, who finds ready vend and a high\r\nprice for it among the builders and brick-makers. Those who _paid_ for\r\nthe road--and their surveyors, _possibly_--know nothing of its value,\r\nor of their own loss by its removal from the road; they consider it\r\nin the light of _dirt_--_offensive_ dirt--and are glad to _pay_ the\r\nscavenger for carrying it away! When the _broom_ comes, the scavenger’s\r\nmen take care to go _deep_ enough; and many of them are, moreover,\r\ninstructed to keep the ‘_mac_’ as free from admixture with foreign\r\nsubstances as possible; for, though cattle-dung be valuable enough in\r\nitself, the ‘_mac_’ loses _its_ value to the builder and brickmaker by\r\nbeing _mixed with it_. Indeed, both are valuable for their respective\r\nuses if kept separate, not otherwise.”\r\n\r\nOn my first making inquiries as to the uses and value of “mac,” I was\r\nfrequently told that it was utterly valueless, and that great trouble\r\nand expense were incurred in merely getting rid of it. That this is the\r\ncase with many contractors is, doubtlessly, the fact; for now, unless\r\nthe “mac,” or, rather, the general road-dirt, be ordered, or a market\r\nfor it be assured, it must be got rid of without a remuneration. Even\r\nwhen the contractor can shoot the “mac” in his own yard, and keep it\r\nthere for a customer, there is the cost of re-loading and re-carting;\r\na cost which a customer requiring to use it at any distance may not\r\nchoose to incur. Great quantities of “mac,” therefore, are wasted; and\r\nmore would be wasted, were there places to waste it in.\r\n\r\nLet me, therefore, before speaking of the uses and sale of it,\r\npoint out some of the reasons for this wasting of the “mac” with\r\nother street-dirt. In the first place, the weight of a cart-load\r\nof street-refuse of any kind is usually estimated at a ton; but I\r\nam assured that the weight of a cart-load of “stiff mac” is a ton\r\nand a quarter at the least; and this weight becomes so trying to a\r\nscavenger’s horse, as the day’s work advances, that the contractor, to\r\nspare the animal, is often glad to get rid of the “mac” in any manner\r\nand without any remuneration. Thousands of loads of “mac,” or rather of\r\nmixed street-dirt, have for this, and other reasons, been thrown away;\r\nand no small quantity has been thrown down the gulley-holes, to find\r\nits way into that main metropolitan sewer, the Thames. Of this matter,\r\nhowever, I shall have to speak hereafter.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that it is common for contractors to represent\r\nthe “mac” they collect as being utterly valueless, and indeed an\r\nincumbrance. The “mixed mac,” as I have said, may be so. Some\r\ncontractors urge, especially in their bargains with the parish\r\nboard, that all kinds of street dirt are not only worthless, but\r\nexpensive to be got rid of. Five or six years ago, this was urged\r\nvery strenuously, for then there was what was accounted a combination\r\namong the contractors. The south-west district of St. Pancras, until\r\nwithin the last six years, _received_ from the contractor for the\r\npublic scavengery, 100_l._ for the year’s aggregation of street and\r\nhouse dirt. Since then, however, they have had to pay him 500_l._ for\r\nremoving it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the reluctance of some of the contractors to give\r\ninformation on this, or indeed any subject connected with their trade,\r\nI have ascertained from indubitable authority, that “mac” is disposed\r\nof in the following manner. Some, but this is mostly the mixed kind,\r\nis got rid of in _any_ manner; it has even been diluted with water so\r\nas to be driven down the drains. Some is mixed with the general street\r\nordure--about a quarter of “mac,” I was told, to three-quarters of dung\r\nand street mud--and shipped off in barges as manure. Some is given to\r\nbuilders, when they require it for the foundations of any edifices that\r\nare “handy,” or rather it is carted thither for a nominal price, such\r\nas a trifle as beer-money for the men. Some, however, is _sold_ for the\r\nsame purpose, the contractors alleging that the charge is merely for\r\ncartage. Some, again, is given away or sold (with the like allegation)\r\nfor purposes of levelling, of filling up cavities, or repairing\r\nunevennesses in any ground where improvements are being carried on;\r\nand, finally, some is sold to masons, plasterers, and brickmakers, for\r\nthe purposes of their trade.\r\n\r\nEven for such purposes as “filling up,” there must be in the “mixed\r\nmac” supplied, at least a considerable preponderance of the pure\r\nmaterial, or there would not be, as I heard it expressed, a sufficient\r\n“setting” for what was required.\r\n\r\nAs a set-off to what is sold, however, I may here state that 30_s._ has\r\nbeen paid for the privilege of depositing a barge-load of mixed street\r\ndirt in Battersea-fields, merely to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of the unmixed “mac” is as a component part of the\r\nmortar, or lime, of the mason in the exterior, and of the plasterer in\r\nthe interior, construction of buildings, and as an ingredient of the\r\nmill in brick-grounds.\r\n\r\nThe accounts I received of the properties of “mac” from the vendors of\r\nit, were very contradictory. One man, until lately connected with its\r\nsale, informed me that as far as his own experience extended, “mac”\r\nwas most in demand among scamping builders, and slop brickmakers, who\r\nlooked only to what was cheap. To a notorious “scamper,” he one morning\r\nsent three cart-loads of “mac” at 1_s._ a load, all to be used in the\r\nerection of the skeleton of one not very large house; and he believed\r\nthat when it was used instead of sand with lime, it was for inferior\r\nwork only, and was mixed, either for masons’ or plasterers’ work, with\r\nbad, low-priced mortar. Another man, with equal knowledge of the trade,\r\nhowever, represented “mac” as a most valuable article for the builder’s\r\npurposes, it was “so _binding_,” and this he repeated emphatically. A\r\nworking builder told me that “mac” was as good as the best sand; it\r\nmade the mortar “hang,” and without either that or sand, the lime would\r\n“brittle” away.\r\n\r\n“Mac” may be said to be composed of pulverised granite and rain water.\r\nGranite is composed of quartz, felspar, and mica, each in granular\r\ncrystals. Hence, alumina being clay, and silex a substance which has a\r\nstrong tendency to enter into combination with the lime of the mortar,\r\nthe pulverizing of granite tends to produce a substance which has\r\nnecessarily great binding and indurating properties.\r\n\r\nFrom this reduction of “mac” to its elements, it is manifest that it\r\npossesses qualities highly valuable in promoting the cohesive property\r\nof mortar, so that, were greater attention paid to its collection by\r\nthe scavenger, there would, in all probability, be an improved demand\r\nfor the article, for I find that it is already used in the prosecution\r\nof some of the best masons’ work. On this head I can cite the authority\r\nof a gentleman, at once a scientific and practical architect, who said\r\nto me,--\r\n\r\n“‘Mac’ is used by many respectable builders for making mortar. The\r\nobjection to it is, that it usually contains much extraneous decaying\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\nIncreased care in the collection of the material would, perhaps, remove\r\nthis cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nI heard of one West-end builder, employing many hands, however, who had\r\ntotally or partially discontinued the use of “mac,” as he had met with\r\nsome which he considered showed itself _brittle_ in the plastering of\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\n“Mac,” is pounded, and sometimes sifted, when required for use, and is\r\nthen mixed and “worked up” with the lime for mortar, in the same way as\r\nsand. By the brickmakers it is mixed with the clay, ground, and formed\r\ninto bricks in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nOf the proportion sold to builders, plasterers, and brickmakers,\r\nseverally, I could learn no precise particulars. The general opinion\r\nappears to be, that “mac” is sold most to brickmakers, and that it\r\nwould find even a greater sale with them, were not brick-fields\r\nbecoming more and more remote. I moreover found it universally\r\nadmitted, that “mac” was in less demand--some said by one-half--than it\r\nwas five or six years back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are the _uses_ of “mac,” and we now come to the question of its\r\n_value_.\r\n\r\nThe price of the purer “mac” seems, from the best information I can\r\nprocure, to have varied considerably. It is now generally cheap. I\r\ndid not hear any very sufficing reason advanced to account for the\r\ndepreciation, but one of the contractors expressed an opinion that this\r\nwas owing to the “disturbed” state of the trade. Since the passing of\r\nthe Sanitary Bill, the contractors for the public scavengery have been\r\nprevented “shooting” any valueless street-dirt, or dirt “not worth\r\ncarriage” in convenient waste-places, as they were once in the habit\r\nof doing. Their yards and wharfs are generally full, so that, to avoid\r\ncommitting a nuisance, the contractor will not unfrequently sell his\r\n“mac” at reduced rates, and be glad thus to get rid of it. To this\r\ncause especially Mr. ---- attributed the deterioration in the price of\r\n“mac,” but if he had convenience, he told me, and any change was made\r\nin the present arrangements, he would not scruple to store 1000 loads\r\nfor the demands of next summer, as a speculation. I am of opinion,\r\nmoreover, notwithstanding what seemed something very like unanimity\r\nof opinion on the part of the sellers of “mac,” that what is given or\r\nthrown away is usually, if not always, _mixed_ or inferior “mac,” and\r\nthat what is sold at the lowest rate is only a degree or two better;\r\nunless, indeed, it be under the immediate pressure of some of the\r\ncircumstances I have pointed out, as want of room, &c.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring the price of “mac,” I believe the answer of a vendor\r\nwill almost invariably be found to be “a shilling a load;” a little\r\nfurther inquiry, however, shows that an extra sum may have to be paid.\r\nA builder, who gave me the information, asked a parish contractor the\r\nprice of “mac.” The contractor at once offered to supply him with 500\r\nloads at 1_s._ a load, if the “mac” were ordered beforehand, and could\r\nbe shot at once; but it would be 6_d._ a mile extra if delivered a mile\r\nout of the mac-seller’s parish circuit, or more than a mile from his\r\nyard; while, if extra care were to be taken in the collection of the\r\n“mac,” it would be 2_d._, 3_d._, 4_d._, or 6_d._ a load higher. This,\r\nit must be understood, was the price of “_wet_ mac.”\r\n\r\nGood “_dry_ mac,” that is to say, “mac” ready for use, is sold to the\r\nbuilder or the brickmaker at from 2_s._ to 3_s._ the load; 2_s._ 6_d._,\r\nor something very near it, being now about an average price. It is\r\ndried in the contractor’s yard by being exposed to the sun, or it is\r\nsometimes protected from the weather by a shed, while being dried. More\r\nwet “mac” would be shot for the trade, and kept until dry, but for want\r\nof room in the contractors’ yards and wharfs; for “mac” must give way\r\nto the more valuable dung, and the dust and ashes from the bins. The\r\nbest “mac” is sometimes described as “country mac,” that is to say, it\r\nis collected from those suburban roads where it is likely to be little\r\nmixed with dung, &c.\r\n\r\nA contractor told me that during the last twelve months he had sold 300\r\nloads of “mac;” he had no account of what he had given away, to be rid\r\nof it, or of what he had sold at nominal prices. Another contractor, I\r\nwas told by his managing man, sold last year about 400 loads. But both\r\nthese parties are “in a large way,” and do not supply the data upon\r\nwhich to found a calculation as to an average yearly sale; for though\r\nin the metropolis there are, according to the list I have given in p.\r\n167 of the present volume, 63 contracts, for cleansing the metropolis,\r\nwithout including the more remote suburbs, such as Greenwich, Lewisham,\r\nTooting, Streatham, Ealing, Brentford, and others--still some of the\r\ndistricts contracted for yield no “mac” at all.\r\n\r\nFrom what I consider good authority, I may venture upon the following\r\nmoderate computation as to the quantity of “mac” sold last year.\r\n\r\nEstimating the number of contracts for cleansing the more central\r\nparishes at 35, and adding 20 for all the outlying parishes of the\r\nmetropolis--in some of which the supply of road “mac” is very fine, and\r\nby no means scarce--it may be accurate enough to state that, out of\r\nthe 55 individual contracts, 300 loads of “mac” were sold by each in\r\nthe course of last year. This gives 16,500 loads of “mac” disposed of\r\nper annum. It may, moreover, be a reasonable estimate to consider this\r\n“mac,” wet and dry together, as fetching 1_s._ 6_d._ a load, so that we\r\nhave for the sum realized the following result:--\r\n\r\n  16,500 loads of “mac,” at 1_s._ 6_d._\r\n  per load                                           £1237  10\r\n\r\nIt may probably be considered by the contractors that 1_s._ 6_d._ is\r\ntoo high an average of price per load: if the price be minimized the\r\nresult will be--\r\n\r\n  16,500 loads of “mac,” at 1_s._ per\r\n  load                                                £825\r\n\r\nThen if we divide the first estimate among the 55 contractors, we find\r\nthat they receive upwards of 22_l._ each; the second estimate gives\r\nnearly 15_l._ each.\r\n\r\nI repeat, that in this inquiry I can but approximate. One gentleman\r\ntold me he thought the quantity of “mac” thus sold in the year was\r\ntwice 1600 loads; another asserted that it was not 1000. I am assured,\r\nhowever, that my calculation does not exceed the truth.\r\n\r\nI have given the full quantity of “mac,” as nearly, I believe, as it\r\ncan be computed, to be yielded by the metropolitan thoroughfares; the\r\nsurplusage, after deducting the 1600 loads sold, must be regarded as\r\nconsisting of mixed, and therefore useless, “mac;” that is to say,\r\n“mac” rendered so _thin_ by continuous wet weather, that it is little\r\nworth; “mac” wasted because it is not storeable in the contractor’s\r\nyard; and “mac” used as a component part of a barge-load of manure.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my inquiries I heard it very generally stated that\r\nuntil five or six years ago 2_s._ 6_d._ might be considered a regular\r\nprice for a load of “mac,” while 4_s._, 5_s._, or even 6_s._ have been\r\npaid to one contractor, according to his own account, for the better\r\nkind of this commodity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MUD OF THE STREETS.\r\n\r\nThe dirt yielded by a macadamized road, no matter what the composition,\r\nis always termed by the scavengers “_mac_;” what is yielded by a\r\ngranite-paved way is always “_mud_.” Mixed mud and “mac” are generally\r\nlooked upon as useless.\r\n\r\nI inquired of one man, connected with a contractor’s wharf, if he could\r\nreadily distinguish the difference between “mac” and other street or\r\nmixed dirts, and he told me that he could do so, more especially when\r\nthe stuff was sufficiently dried or set, at a glance. “If mac was\r\ndarker,” he said, “it always looked brighter than other street-dirts,\r\nas if all the colour was not ground out of the stone.” He pointed out\r\nthe different kinds, and his definition seemed to me not a bad one,\r\nalthough it may require a practised eye to make the distinction readily.\r\n\r\nStreet-mud is only partially mud, for mud is earthy particles saturated\r\nwith water, and in the composition of the scavenger’s street-mud are\r\ndung, general refuse (such as straw and vegetable remains), and the\r\nmany things which in poor neighbourhoods are still thrown upon the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nIn the busier thoroughfares of the metropolis--apart from the City,\r\nwhere there is no macadamization requiring notice--it is almost\r\nimpossible to keep street “mac” and mud distinct, even if the\r\nscavengers cared more to do so than is the case at present; for a\r\nwaggon, or any other vehicle, entering a street paved with blocks of\r\nwrought granite from a macadamized road must convey “mac” amongst mud;\r\nboth “mac” and mud, however, as I have stated, are the most valuable\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nIn a Report on the Supply of Water, Appendix No. III., Mr. Holland,\r\nUpper Stamford-street, Waterloo-road, is stated to have said, in reply\r\nto a question on the subject:--“Suppose the inhabitants of one parish\r\nare desirous of having their streets in good order and clean: unless\r\nthe adjoining districts concur, a great and unjust expense is imposed\r\nupon the cleaner parish; because every vehicle which passes from a\r\ndirty on to a clean street carries dirt from the former to the latter,\r\nand renders cleanliness more difficult and expensive. The inhabitants\r\nof London have an interest in the condition of other streets besides\r\nthose of their own parish. Besides the inhabitants of Regent-street,\r\nfor instance, all the riders in the 5000 vehicles that daily pass\r\nthrough that great thoroughfare are affected by its condition; and the\r\ninhabitants of Regent-street, who have to bear the cost of keeping\r\nthat street in good repair and well cleansed, _for others’ benefit\r\nas well as for their own_, may fairly feel aggrieved if they do not\r\nexperience the benefits of good and clean streets when they go into\r\nother districts.”\r\n\r\nIn the admixture of street-dirt there is this material difference--the\r\ndung, which spoils good “mac,” makes good mud more valuable.\r\n\r\nAfter having treated so fully of the road-produce of “mac,” there seems\r\nno necessity to say more about mud than to consider its quantity, its\r\nvalue, and its uses.\r\n\r\nIn the Haymarket, which is about an eighth of a mile in length, and\r\n18 yards in width, a load and a half of street-mud is collected\r\ndaily (Sundays excepted), take the year through. As a farmer or\r\nmarket-gardener will give 3_s._ a load for common street-mud, and\r\ncart it away at his own cost, we find that were all this mud sold\r\nseparately, at the ordinary rate, the yearly receipt for one street\r\nalone would be 70_l._ 4_s._ This public way, however, furnishes no\r\ncriterion of the general mud-produce of the metropolis. We must,\r\ntherefore, adopt some other basis for a calculation; and I have\r\nmentioned the Haymarket merely to show the great extent of street-dirt\r\naccruing in a largely-frequented locality.\r\n\r\nBut to obtain other data is a matter of no small difficulty where\r\nreturns are not published nor even kept. I have, however, been\r\nfortunate enough to obtain the assistance of gentlemen whose public\r\nemployment has given them the best means of forming an accurate opinion.\r\n\r\nThe street mud from the Haymarket, it has been positively ascertained,\r\nis 1-1/4 load each wet day the year through. Fleet-street,\r\nLudgate-hill, Cheapside, Newgate-street, the “off” parts of St. Paul’s\r\nChurch-yard, Cornhill, Leadenhall-street, Bishopsgate-street, the free\r\nbridges, with many other places where locomotion never ceases, are, in\r\nproportion to their width, as productive of street mud as the Haymarket.\r\n\r\nWere the Haymarket a mile in length, it would supply, at its present\r\nrate of traffic, to the scavenger 6 loads of street mud daily, or\r\n36 loads for the scavenger’s working week. In this yield, however,\r\nI am assured by practical men, the Haymarket is six times in excess\r\nof the average streets; and when compared with even “great business”\r\nthoroughfares, of a narrow character, such as Watling-street, Bow-lane,\r\nOld-change, and other thoroughfares off Cheapside and Cornhill, the\r\nproduce of the Haymarket is from 10 to 40 per cent. in excess.\r\n\r\nI am assured, however, and especially by a gentleman who had\r\nlooked closely into the matter--as he at one time had been engaged\r\nin preparing estimates for a projected company purposing to deal\r\nwith street-manures--that the 50 miles of the City may be safely\r\ncalculated as yielding daily 1-1/2 load of street mud per mile. Narrow\r\nstreets--Thames-street for instance, which is about three-quarters\r\nof a mile long--yield from 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 loads daily, according\r\nto the season; but a number of off-streets and open places, such\r\nas Long-alley, Alderman’s-walk, America-square, Monument-yard,\r\nBridgewater-square, Austin-friars, and the like, are either streets\r\nwithout horse-thoroughfares, or are seldom traversed by vehicles. If,\r\nthen, we calculate that there are 100 miles of paved streets adjoining\r\nthe City, and yielding the same quantity of street mud daily as the\r\nabove estimate, and 200 more miles in the less central parts of the\r\nmetropolis, yielding only half that quantity, we find the following\r\ndaily sum during the wet season:--\r\n\r\n                                                 Loads.\r\n  150 miles of paved streets, yielding 1-1/2\r\n  load of street mud per mile                     225\r\n\r\n  200 miles of paved streets, yielding 3/4\r\n  load of street mud per mile                     150\r\n                                                  ---\r\n                                                  375\r\n\r\n  Weekly amount of street mud during\r\n  the wet season                                2,250\r\n\r\n  Total ditto for six months in the year       58,500\r\n                                               ------\r\n  63,000 loads of street mud, at 3_s._ per\r\n  load                                          £8775\r\n\r\nThe great sale for this mud, perhaps nineteen-twentieths, is from the\r\nbarges. A barge of street-manure, about one-fourth (more or less)\r\n“mac,” or rather “mac” mixed with its street proportion of dung, &c.,\r\nand three-fourths mud, dung, &c., contains from 30 to 40 tons, or as\r\nmany loads. These manure barges are often to be seen on the Thames,\r\nbut nearly three-fourths of them are found on the canals, especially\r\nthe Paddington, the Regent’s, and the Surrey, these being the most\r\nimmediately connected with the interior part of the metropolis. A\r\nbarge-load of this manure is usually sold at from 5_l._ to 6_l._\r\nCalculating its average weight at 35 tons, and its average sale at\r\n5_l._ 10_s._, the price is rather more than 3_s._ a load. “Common\r\nstreet mud,” I have been informed on good authority, “fetches 3_s._ per\r\nload from the farmer, when he himself carts it away.”\r\n\r\nThe price of the barge-load of manure is tolerably uniform, for the\r\nquality is generally the same. Some of the best, because the cleanest,\r\nstreet mud--as it is mixed only with horse-dung--is obtained from the\r\nwood streets, but this mode of pavement is so circumscribed that the\r\ncontractors pay no regard to its manure produce, as a general rule, and\r\nmix it carelessly with the rest. Such, at least, is the account they\r\nthemselves give, and they generally represent that the street manure\r\nis, owing to the outlay for cartage and boatage, little remunerative\r\nto them at the prices they obtain; notwithstanding, they are paid to\r\nremove it from the streets. Indeed, I heard of one contractor who was\r\nsaid to be so dissatisfied with the demand for, and the prices fetched\r\nby, his street-manure, that he has rented a few acres not far from the\r\nRegent’s Canal, to test the efficacy of street dirt as a fertilizer,\r\nand to ascertain if to cultivate might not be more profitable than to\r\nsell.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SURFACE-WATER OF THE STREETS OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of what Professor Way has called the “street waters”\r\nof the metropolis, is one of as great moment as any of those I have\r\npreviously treated in my details concerning street refuse, whether\r\n“mac,” mud, or dung. Indeed, water enters largely into the composition\r\nof the two former substances, while even the street dung is greatly\r\naffected by the rain.\r\n\r\nThe _feeders_ of the street, as regards the street surface-water,\r\nare principally the rains. I will first consider the amount of\r\nsurface-water supplied by the rain descending upon the area of the\r\nmetropolis: upon the roofs of the houses, and the pavement of the\r\nstreets and roads.\r\n\r\nThe depth of rain falling in London in the different months,\r\naccording to the observations and calculations of the most eminent\r\nmeteorologists, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  ----------+----------------------------------------+------------+---------\r\n            |        Depth of Rain in inches.        | Quantity of|Number of\r\n            +--------------+------------+------------+rain falling| days on\r\n   Months.  |Royal Society,|   Howard,  |  Daniell,  |   in the   |  which\r\n            | according to |according to|according to| different  |  rain\r\n            | observation. |observation.|calculation.|  seasons.  | falls.\r\n  ----------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+---------\r\n  January   |      1·56    |    1·907   |    1·483   |            |   14·4\r\n  February  |      1·45    |    1·643   |    0·746   |   Winter.  |   15·8\r\n  March     |      1·36    |    1·542   |    1·440   |    5·868   |   12·7\r\n  April     |      1·55    |    1·719   |    1·786   |            |   14·0\r\n  May       |      1·67    |    2·036   |    1·853   |   Spring.  |   15·8\r\n  June      |      1·98    |    1·964   |    1·830   |    4·813   |   11·8\r\n  July      |      2·44    |    2·592   |    2·516   |            |   16·1\r\n  August    |      2·37    |    2·134   |    1·453   |   Summer.  |   16·3\r\n  September |      2·97    |    1·644   |    2·193   |    6·682   |   12·3\r\n  October   |      2·46    |    2·872   |    2·073   |            |   16·2\r\n  November  |      2·58    |    2·637   |    2·400   |   Autumn.  |   15·0\r\n  December  |      1·65    |    2·489   |    2·426   |    7·441   |   17·7\r\n  ----------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+---------\r\n  Totals    |     24·04    |   25·179   |   22·199   |   24·804   |  178·1\r\n  -------------------------+------------+------------+------------+---------\r\n\r\nThe rainfall in London, according to a ten years’ average of the\r\nRoyal Society’s observations, amounts to 23 inches; in 1848 it was as\r\nhigh as 28 inches, and in 1847 as low as 15 inches. The depth of rain\r\nannually falling near London is stated by Mr. Luke Howard to be, on an\r\naverage of 23 years (1797-1819), as much as 25·179 inches. Mr. Daniell\r\nsays that the average annual fall is 23-1/10 inches. The mean of the\r\nobservations made at Greenwich between the years 1838 and 1849 was\r\n24·84 inches.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from an account of the “Soft Water Springs of the\r\nSurrey Sands,” by the Hon. Wm. Napier, is interesting.\r\n\r\n“The amount of rainfall,” says the Author, “is taken from a register\r\nkept at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from the year 1818 to\r\n1846.\r\n\r\n“The average fall of the last 15 years, during which time the register\r\nappears to have been correctly kept, is 22·64 inches. I consider\r\nthis to be a very low estimate, however, of the average rainfall\r\nover the whole district. The fall on the ranges of the Hindhead must\r\nconsiderably exceed this amount, for I find in White’s ‘Selborne,’ a\r\nregister for ten years at that place; the greatest fall being in 1782,\r\n50·26 inches, the lowest, in 1788, 22·50 inches, and the average of all\r\n37·58 inches. The elevation of the Hindhead is about 800 feet above\r\nmean tide.\r\n\r\n“With reference to the measurement of rainfall, it is difficult indeed\r\nto obtain more than a very approximate idea for a given district of not\r\nvery great extent; the method of measurement is so uncertain, as liable\r\nto be affected by currents of air and evaporation. It is well known\r\nthat elevated regions attract by condensation more rain than low lands,\r\nand yet a rain-gauge placed on the ground will register a greater fall\r\nthan one placed immediately, and even at a small height, above it.\r\n\r\n“M. Arago has shown from 12 years’ observations at Paris, that the\r\naverage depth of rain on the terrace of the Observatory was 19·88\r\ninches, while 30 yards lower it was 22·21 inches. Dr. Heberden has\r\nshown the rainfall on the top of Westminster Cathedral, during a\r\ncertain period to be only 12·09 inches, and at a lower level on the top\r\nof a house in the neighbourhood to be 22·608 inches. This fact has been\r\nobserved all over the world, and I can only account for it as arising\r\npartly from the greater amount of condensation the nearer the earth’s\r\nsurface, but probably also from currents of air depriving a rain-gauge\r\nat a high elevation of its fair share.”\r\n\r\nThe results of the above observations, as to the yearly quantity of\r\nrain falling in the metropolis, may be summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                         Inches of\r\n                                       Rain falling\r\n                                         Annually.\r\n  Royal Society (average of 20 years)     24·04\r\n  Mr. Howard (average of 23 years)        25·179\r\n  Professor Daniell                       22·199\r\n  Dr. Heberden                            22·608\r\n                                          ------\r\n    Mean                                  23·506\r\n\r\nThe “mean mean,” or average of all the averages here given is within a\r\nfraction the average of the Royal Society’s Observations for 10 years,\r\nand this is the quantity that I shall adopt in my calculations as to\r\nthe gross volume of rain falling over the entire area of London.\r\n\r\nI have shown, by a detail of the respective districts in the Registrar\r\nGeneral’s department, that the metropolis contains 74,070 statute\r\nacres. Every square inch of this extent, as garden, arable, or\r\npasture ground, or as road or street, or waste place, or house, or\r\ninclosed yard or lawn, of course receives its modicum of rain. Each\r\nacre comprises 6,272,640 square inches, and we thus find the whole\r\nmetropolitan area to contain a number of square inches, almost beyond\r\nthe terms of popular arithmetic, and best expressible in figures.\r\n\r\nArea of metropolis in square inches, 464,614,444,800. Now, multiplying\r\nthese four hundred and sixty four thousand, six hundred and fourteen\r\nmillions, four hundred and forty-four thousand, eight hundred square\r\ninches, by 23, the number of inches of rain falling every year in\r\nLondon, we have the following result:--\r\n\r\nTotal quantity of rain falling yearly in the metropolis,\r\n10,686,132,230,400 cubic inches.\r\n\r\nThen, as a fraction more than 277-1/4 cubic inches of water represent\r\na weight of 10 lbs., and an admeasurement of a gallon, we have the\r\nfollowing further results:--\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------\r\n                    | Weight in pounds      |     Admeasurement\r\n                    |     and tons.         |      in gallons.\r\n  ------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------\r\n  Yearly Rainfall } | 385,399,721,220 lbs., |\r\n    in the        } |        or             |  38,539,972,122 gals.\r\n    Metropolis    } | 172,053,447 tons.     |\r\n  ------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of water mechanically supplied every day to the\r\nmetropolis is said to be in round numbers 55,000,000 gallons, the\r\namount being made up in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n\r\nDAILY MECHANICAL SUPPLY OF WATER TO METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\n  Sources of Supply.

This must be a considerable proportion of the whole,\r\nsince the streets themselves, allowing them to be ten yards wide on an\r\naverage, would seem to occupy only about one-tenth part of the entire\r\nmetropolitan area, so that the rain falling _directly_ upon the public\r\nthoroughfares will be but a tithe of the aggregate quantity. But the\r\nsurface-water of the streets is increased largely by tributary shoots\r\nfrom courts and drainless houses, and hence we may fairly assume\r\nthe _natural_ supply to be doubled by such means. At this rate the\r\nvolume of rain-water annually poured into and upon the metropolitan\r\nthoroughfares by natural means, will be between five and six thousand\r\nmillions of gallons, or one hundred times the quantity that is daily\r\nsupplied to the houses of the metropolis by mechanical agency.\r\n\r\nStill only a part of this quantity appears in the form of\r\nsurface-water, for a considerable portion of it is absorbed by the\r\nground on which it falls--especially in dry weather--serving either to\r\n“lay the dust,” or to convert it into mud. Due regard, therefore, being\r\nhad to all these considerations, we cannot, consistently with that\r\ncaution which is necessary in all statistical inquiries, estimate the\r\nsurface-water of the London streets at more than one thousand millions\r\nof gallons per annum, or twenty times the daily mechanical supply to\r\nthe houses of the entire metropolis, and which it has been asserted is\r\nsufficient to exhaust a lake covering the area of St. James’s-park, 30\r\ninches in depth.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water annually poured upon the streets in the process\r\nof what is termed “watering” amounts, according to the returns of the\r\nBoard of Health, to 275,000,000 gallons per annum! But as this seldom\r\nor never assumes the form of street surface-water, it need form no part\r\nof the present estimate.\r\n\r\nWhat proportion of the thousand million gallons of “slop dirt” produced\r\nannually in the London streets is carried off down the drains, and\r\nwhat proportion is ladled up by the scavengers, I have no means of\r\nascertaining, but that vast quantities run away into the sewers and\r\nthere form large deposits of mud, everything tends to prove.\r\n\r\nMr. Lovick, on being asked, “How many loads of deposit have been\r\nremoved in any one week in the Surrey and Kent district? What is the\r\ntotal quantity of deposit removed in any one week in the whole of the\r\nmetropolitan district?” replied:\r\n\r\n“It is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain correctly the\r\nquantity removed, owing to the variety of forms of sewers and the\r\never-varying forms assumed by the deposit from the action of varying\r\nvolumes of water; but I have had observations made on the rate of\r\naccumulation, from which I have been enabled roughly to approximate\r\nit. In one week, in the Surrey and Kent district, about 1000 yards\r\nwere removed. In one week, in the whole of the metropolitan districts,\r\nincluding the Surrey and Kent district, between 4000 and 5000 yards\r\nwere removed; but in portions of the districts these operations were\r\nnot in progress.”\r\n\r\nIt is not here stated of what the deposit consisted, but there is no\r\ndoubt that “mac” from the streets formed a great portion of it. Neither\r\nis it stated what period of time had sufficed for the accumulation; but\r\nit is evident enough that such deposits in the course of a year must\r\nbe very great.\r\n\r\nThe street surface-water has been analyzed by Professor Way, and found\r\nto yield different constituents according to the different pavements\r\nfrom which it has been discharged. The results are as follows:--\r\n\r\n “_Examination of Samples of Water from Street Drainage, taken from the\r\n Gullies in the Sewers during the rain of 6th May, 1850._\r\n\r\n “The waters were all more or less turbid, and some of them gave off\r\n very noxious odours, due principally to the escape of sulphuretted\r\n hydrogen gas.\r\n\r\n “Some of them were alkaline to test-paper, but the majority were\r\n neutral.\r\n\r\n “The following table exhibits the quantity of matter (both in solution\r\n and in solid state) contained in an imperial gallon of each specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n “STREET WATERS.\r\n\r\n  -------+--------------------+----------+---------+--------------------------------\r\n  Number |                    | Quality  | Quality | Residue in an Imperial Gallon.\r\n    of   |  NAME OF STREET.   |    of    |    of   +---------+----------+-----------\r\n  Bottle.|                    | Paving.  |Traffic. |Soluble. |Insoluble.|   Both.\r\n  -------+--------------------+----------+---------+---------+----------+-----------\r\n         |                    |          |         | Grains. | Grains.  |  Grains.\r\n     1   |Duke-street,        |          |         |         |          |\r\n         |  Manchester-square | Macadam  |Middling |  92·80  |  105·95  |   198·75\r\n     7   |Foley-street        |          |         |         |          |\r\n         |  (upper part)      |    „     | Little  |  95·13  |  116·30  |   211·43\r\n     5   |Gower-street        | Granite  |Middling | 126·00  |  168·30  |   294·30\r\n    12   |Norton-street       |    „     | Little  | 123·87  |    3·00  |   126·87\r\n     3   |Hampstead-road      |          |         |         |          |\r\n         |  (above the canal) |Ballasted |  Great  |  96·00  |   84·00  |   180·00\r\n     4   |Ferdinand-street    |    „     |Middling |  44·00  |   48·30  |    92·30\r\n     2   |Ferdinand-place     |    „     | Little  |  50·80  |   34·30  |    85·10\r\n    10   |Oxford-street       | Granite  |  Great  | 276·23  |  537·10  |   813·33\r\n     6   |      „             | Macadam  |    „    | 194·62  |  390·30  |   584·92\r\n    11   |      „             |   Wood   |    „    |  34·00  |    5·00  |    39·00\r\n  -------+--------------------+----------+---------+---------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\n “The influence of the quality of the paving on the composition of the\r\n drainage water,” says Professor Way, “is well seen in the specimens\r\n Nos. 10, 6, and 11, all of them from Oxford-street, the traffic being\r\n described as ‘Great.’\r\n\r\n “The quantity of soluble salts is here found to be greatest from the\r\n granite matter from the macadamized road, and very inconsiderable from\r\n the wood pavement.\r\n\r\n “The same relation between the granite and macadam pavement seems\r\n to hold good in the other instances; the granite for any quality of\r\n traffic affording more soluble salts to the water than the macadam.\r\n\r\n “The ballasted pavement holds a position intermediate between the\r\n macadam and the wood, giving more soluble salts than the wood, but\r\n less than the macadam.\r\n\r\n “The quantity of solid (insoluble) matter in the different samples of\r\n water, _which is a measure of the mechanical waste of the different\r\n kinds of pavement_, appears also to follow the same relation as that\r\n of the soluble salts; that is to say, granite greatest, next macadam,\r\n then ballasted, and, lastly, wood pavement, which affords a quantity\r\n of solid deposit almost too small to deserve notice.\r\n\r\n “The influence of the quality of traffic on the composition of the\r\n different specimens of drainage is well marked in nearly all cases;\r\n the greatest amount of matter both insoluble and soluble being found\r\n in the water obtained from the streets of great traffic.\r\n\r\n “The following table shows the composition of the soluble salts of\r\n four specimens, two of them being from the granite, and two from the\r\n macadam pavement.\r\n\r\n “It appears from the table that the granite furnishes little or\r\n no magnesia to the water, whilst the quantity from the macadam is\r\n considerable.\r\n\r\n “On the other hand, the quantity of potash is far greatest in the\r\n water derived from the granite.\r\n\r\n “The traffic, as was before seen, has a very great influence on the\r\n quantity of the soluble salts. It seems also to influence their\r\n composition, for we find no carbonates either in the water from the\r\n granite, or that from the macadam, where the traffic is little;\r\n whereas, when it is great, carbonates of lime and potash are found\r\n in the water in large quantity, a circumstance which is no doubt\r\n attributable to the action of decaying organic matter on the mineral\r\n substances of the pavement.\r\n\r\n\r\n “ANALYSIS OF THE SOLUBLE MATTER IN DIFFERENT SPECIMENS OF STREET\r\n DRAINAGE WATER.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------\r\n                                           |   Grains in an Imperial Gallon.\r\n                                           +-----------------+-----------------\r\n                                           |  Great Traffic. | Little Traffic.\r\n                                           +--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                                           |Granite.|Macadam.|Granite.|Macadam.\r\n                                           | No. 10.| No. 6. | No. 12.| No. 7.\r\n  -----------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Water of combination and some soluble    |        |        |        |\r\n    organic matter                         |  77·56 |  29·07 |  22·72 |  13·73\r\n  Silica                                   |    ·51 |   2·81 |   ...  |   ...\r\n  Carbonic Acid                            |  15·84 |  12·23 |  None  |  None\r\n  Sulphuric Acid                           |  36·49 |  38·23 |  46·48 |  34·08\r\n  Lime                                     |   6·65 |  13·38 |  25·90 |  16·10\r\n  Magnesia                                 |  None  |  23·51 |  Trace |   3·50\r\n  Oxide of Iron and Alumina, with a little |        |        |        |\r\n    Phosphate of Lime                      |   2·58 |   1·25 |   ...  |   ...\r\n  Chloride of Potassium                    |  None  |  10·99 |  None  |   2·79\r\n    „  Sodium                              |  53·84 |  44·88 |  18·44 |  19·70\r\n  Potash                                   |  82·76 |  18·27 |   8·75 |   5·23\r\n  Soda                                     |   ...  |   ...  |  1·58  |   ...\r\n  -----------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                                           | 276·23 | 194·62 | 123·87 |  95·13\r\n  -----------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n “The insoluble matter in the waters consists of the comminuted\r\n material of the road itself, with small fragments of straw and broken\r\n dung.\r\n\r\n “The quantity of soluble salts (especially of salts of potash) in\r\n many of these samples of water is quite as great, and in some cases\r\n greater, than that found in the samples of sewer-water that have been\r\n examined; and it is open to question and further inquiry, whether the\r\n water obtained from the street-drainage of a crowded city might not\r\n often be of nearly equal value as liquid manure with the sewer-water\r\n with which it is at present allowed to mix.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to the “ballasted pavement” mentioned by Professor Way, I\r\nmay observe that it cannot be considered a _street_-pavement, unless\r\nexceptionally. It is formed principally of Thames ballast mixed with\r\ngravel, and is used in the construction of what are usually private or\r\npleasure walks, such as the “gravel walks” in the inclosures of some of\r\nthe parks, and upon Primrose-hill, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MASTER SCAVENGERS IN FORMER TIMES.\r\n\r\nDegraded as the occupation of the scavenger may be in public\r\nestimation; though “I’d rather sweep the streets” may be a common\r\nremark expressive of the lowest deep of humiliation among those who\r\nnever handled a besom in their lives; yet the very existence of a large\r\nbody who are public cleansers betokens civilization. Their occupation,\r\nindeed, was defined, or rather was established or confirmed, in the\r\nearly periods of our history, when municipal regulations were a sort\r\nof charter of civic protection, of civic liberties, and of general\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe noun _Scavenger_ is said by lexicographers to be derived from the\r\nGerman _schaben_, to shave or scrape, “applied to those who scrape and\r\nclear away the filth from public streets or other places.” The more\r\ndirect derivation, however, is from the Danish verb _skaver_, the Saxon\r\nequivalent of which is _sceafan_, whence the English _shave_. Formerly\r\nthe word was written _Scavager_, and meant simply one who was engaged\r\nin removing the _Scrapeage_ or _Rakeage_ (the working men, it will be\r\nseen, were termed also “rakers”) from the surface of the streets. Hence\r\nit would appear that there is no authority for the verb to scavenge,\r\nwhich has lately come into use. The term from which the personal\r\nsubstantive is directly made, is _scavage_, a word formed from the verb\r\nin the same manner as _sewage_ and _rubbage_ (now fashionably corrupted\r\ninto rubbish), and meaning the refuse which is or should be scraped\r\naway from the roads. The Latin equivalent from the Danish verb _skave_,\r\nis _scabere_.\r\n\r\nI believe that the first mention of a scavenger in our earlier\r\nclassical literature, is by Bishop Hall, one of the lights of the\r\nReformation, in one of his “Satires.”\r\n\r\n    “To see the Pope’s blacke knight, a cloaked frere,\r\n    Sweating in the channel _like a scavengere_.”\r\n\r\nMany similar passages from the old poets and dramatists might be\r\nadduced, but I will content myself with one from the “Martial Maid” of\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher, as bearing immediately on the topic I have to\r\ndiscuss:--\r\n\r\n    “Do I not know thee for the alguazier,\r\n    Whose dunghil _all the parish scavengers_\r\n    Could never rid.”\r\n\r\nJohnson defines a scavenger to be “a petty magistrate, whose province\r\nis to keep the streets clean;” and in the earlier times, certainly the\r\nscavenger was an officer to whom a certain authority was deputed, as to\r\nbeadles and others.\r\n\r\nOne or two of these officials were appointed, according to the\r\nmunicipal or by-laws of the City of London, not to each parish, but\r\nto each ward. Of course, in the good old days, nothing could be done\r\nunless under “the sanction of an oath,” and the scavengers were sworn\r\naccordingly on the Gospel, the following being the form as given in the\r\nblack letter of the laws relating to the city in the time of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n “_The Oath of Scavagers, or Scavengers, of the Ward._\r\n\r\n “Ye shal swear, That ye shal wel and diligently oversee that the\r\n pavements in every Ward be wel and rightfully repaired, and not\r\n haunsed to the noyaunce of the neighbours; and that the Ways, Streets,\r\n and Lanes, be kept clean from Donge and other Filth, for the Honesty\r\n of the City. And that all the Chimneys, Redosses, and Furnaces, be\r\n made of Stone for Defence of Fire. And if ye know any such ye shall\r\n shew it to the Alderman, that he may make due Redress therefore. And\r\n this ye shall not lene. So help you God.”[14]\r\n\r\nTo aid the scavengers in their execution of the duties of the office,\r\nthe following among others were the injunctions of the civic law. They\r\nindicate the former state of the streets of London better than any\r\ndescription. A “Goung (or dung) fermour” appears to be a nightman, a\r\ndung-carrier or bearer, the servant of the master or ward scavenger.\r\n\r\n “No Goungfermour shall spill any ordure in the Street, under pain of\r\n Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence.\r\n\r\n “No Goungfermour shall carry any ordure till after nine of the clock\r\n in the Night, under pain of Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence. No man\r\n shall cast any urine boles, or ordure boles, into the Streets by Day\r\n or Night, _afore the Hour of nine in the Night_. And also he shall not\r\n cast it out, but bring it down and lay it in the Canel, under Pain\r\n of Three Shillings and Four Pence. And if he do so cast it upon any\r\n Person’s Head, the Person to have a lawful Recompense, _if he have\r\n hurt thereby_.\r\n\r\n “No man shall bury any Dung, or Goung, within the Liberties of this\r\n City, under Pain of Forty Shillings.”\r\n\r\nI will not dwell on the state of things which caused such enactments\r\nto be necessary, or on the barbarism of the law which ordered a lawful\r\nrecompense to any person assailed in the manner intimated, only when he\r\nhad “hurt thereby.”\r\n\r\nThese laws were for the government of the city, where a body of\r\nscavengers was sometimes called a “street-ward.” Until about the reign\r\nof Charles II., however, to legislate concerning such matters for the\r\ncity was to legislate for the metropolis, as Southwark was then more\r\nor less under the city jurisdiction, and the houses of the nobility on\r\nthe north bank of the Thames (the Strand), would hardly require the\r\nservices of a public scavenger.\r\n\r\nAs new parishes or districts became populous, and established outside\r\nthe city boundaries, the authorities seem to have regulated the public\r\nscavengery after the fashion of the city; but the whole, in every\r\nrespect of cleanliness, propriety, regularity, or celerity, was most\r\ngrievously defective.\r\n\r\nSome time about the middle of the last century, the scavengers were\r\nconsidered and pronounced by the administrators or explainers of\r\nmunicipal law, to be “two officers chosen yearly in each parish in\r\nLondon and the suburbs, by the constables, churchwardens, and other\r\ninhabitants,” and their business was declared to be, that they should\r\n“hire persons called ‘rakers,’ with carts to clean the streets, and\r\ncarry away the dirt and filth thereof, under a penalty of 40_s._”\r\n\r\nThe scavengers thus appointed we should now term surveyors. There\r\nis little reason to doubt that in the old times the duly-appointed\r\nscavagers or scavengers, laboured in their vocation themselves, and\r\nemployed such a number of additional hands as they accounted necessary;\r\nbut how or when the master scavenger ceased to be a labourer, and how\r\nor when the office became merely nominal, I can find no information.\r\nSo little attention appears to have been paid to this really important\r\nmatter, that there are hardly any records concerning it. The law was\r\nsatisfied to lay down provisions for street-cleansing, but to enforce\r\nthese provisions was left to chance, or to some idle, corrupt, or\r\ninefficient officer or body.\r\n\r\nNeither can I find any precise account of what was formerly done\r\nwith the dirt swept and scraped from the streets, which seems always\r\nto have been left to the discretion of the scavenger to deal with\r\nas he pleased, and such is still the case in a great measure. Some\r\nof this dirt I find, however, promoted “the goodly nutriment of the\r\nland” about London, and some was “delivered in waste places apart\r\nfrom habitations.” These waste places seem to have been the nuclei\r\nof the present dust-yards, and were sometimes “presented,” that is,\r\nthey were reported by a jury of nuisances (or under other titles), as\r\n“places of obscene resort,” for lewd and disorderly persons, the lewd\r\nand disorderly persons consisting chiefly of the very poor, who came\r\nto search among the rubbish for anything that might be valuable or\r\nsaleable; for there were frequent rumours of treasure or plate being\r\ntemporarily hidden in such places by thieves. Some outcast wretches,\r\nmoreover, slept within the shelter of these scavengers’ places, and\r\noccasionally a vigilant officer--even down to our own times, or\r\nwithin these few years--apprehended such wretches, charged them with\r\ndestitution, and had them punished accordingly. Much of the street\r\nrefuse thus “delivered,” especially the “dry rubbish,” was thrown into\r\nthe streets from houses under repair, &c., (I now speak of the past\r\ncentury,) and no use seems to have been made of any part of it unless\r\nany one requiring a load or two of rubbish chose to cart it away.\r\n\r\nI have given this sketch to show what master scavengers were in the\r\nolden times, and I now proceed to point out what is the present\r\ncondition of the trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SEVERAL MODES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF STREET-CLEANSING.\r\n\r\nWe here come to the practical part of this complex subject. We have\r\nascertained the length of the streets of London--we have estimated the\r\namount of daily, weekly, and yearly traffic--calculated the quantity of\r\nmud, dung, “mac,” dust, and surface-water formed and collected annually\r\nthroughout the metropolis--we have endeavoured to arrive at some notion\r\nas to the injury done by all this vast amount of filth owing to what\r\nthe Board of Health has termed “imperfect scavenging,”--and we now come\r\nto treat of the means by which the loads of street refuse--the loads of\r\ndust--loads of “mac” and mud, and the tons of dung, are severally and\r\ncollectively removed throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct, and, in a measure, diametrically opposed,\r\nmethods of street-cleansing at present in operation.\r\n\r\n1. That which consists in cleaning the streets when dirtied.\r\n\r\n2. That which consists in cleaning them and _keeping_ them clean.\r\n\r\nThese modes of scavenging may not appear, to those who have paid but\r\nlittle attention to the matter, to be _very_ widely different means of\r\neffecting the same object. The one, however, removes the refuse from\r\nthe streets (sooner or later) _after it has been formed_, whereas the\r\nother removes it _as fast as it is formed_. By the latter method the\r\nstreets are never allowed to get dirty--by the former they must be\r\ndirty before they are cleansed.\r\n\r\nThe plan of street-cleansing _before_ dirtied, or the pre-scavenging\r\nsystem, is of recent introduction, being the mode adopted by the\r\n“street-orderlies;” that of cleansing after having dirtied, or the\r\npost-scavenging system, is (so far as the more _general_ or common\r\nmethod is concerned) the same as that pursued two centuries ago. I\r\nshall speak of each of these modes in due course, beginning with that\r\nlast mentioned.\r\n\r\nBy the ordinary method of scavenging, the dirt is still swept or\r\nscraped to one side of the public way, then shovelled into a cart and\r\nconveyed to the place of deposit. In wet weather the dirt swept or\r\nscraped to one side is so liquified that it is known as “slop,” and\r\nis “lifted” into the cart in shovels hollowed like sugar-spoons. The\r\nonly change of which I have heard in this mode of scavenging was in\r\none of the tools. Until about nine years ago birch, or occasionally\r\nheather, brooms or besoms were used by the street-sweepers, but\r\nthey soon became clogged in dirty weather, and then, as one working\r\nscavenger explained it to me, “they scattered and drove the dirt to\r\nthe sides ’stead of making it go right a-head as you wants it.” The\r\nmaterial now used for the street-sweeper’s broom is known as “bass,”\r\nand consists of the stems or branches of a New Zealand plant, a\r\nsubstance which has considerable strength and elasticity of fibre, and\r\nboth “sweeps” and “scrapes” in the process of scavenging. The broom\r\nitself, too, is differently constructed, having divisions between the\r\nseveral insertions of bass in the wooden block of the head, so that\r\nclogging is less frequent, and cleaning easier, whereas the birch\r\nbroom consisted of a close mass of twigs, and thus scattered while it\r\nswept the dirt. There was, of course, some outcry on the part of the\r\n“established-order-of-things” gentry among scavengers, against the\r\ninnovation, but it is now general. As all the scavengers, no matter\r\nhow they vary in other respects, work with the brooms described, this\r\none mention of the change will suffice. No doubt the cleansing of\r\nthe streets is accomplished with greater efficiency and with greater\r\ncelerity than it was, but the mere process of manual toil is little\r\naltered.\r\n\r\nIn a work like the present, however, we have more particularly to deal\r\nwith the labourers engaged; and, viewing the subject in this light,\r\nwe may arrange the several modes of street-cleansing into the four\r\nfollowing divisions:--\r\n\r\n1. By paid manual-labourers, or men employed by the contractors, and\r\npaid in the ordinary ways of wages.\r\n\r\n2. By paid “Machine”-labourers, differing from the first only or mainly\r\nin the means by which they attain their end.\r\n\r\n3. By pauper labourers, or men employed by the parishes in which they\r\nare set to work, and either paid in money or in food, or maintained in\r\nthe workhouses.\r\n\r\n4. By street-orderlies, or men employed by philanthropists--a body\r\nof workmen with particular regulations and more organized than other\r\nscavengers.\r\n\r\nBy one or other of these modes of scavengery all the public ways of the\r\nmetropolis are cleansed; and the subject is most peculiar, as including\r\nwithin itself all the several varieties of labour, if we except that\r\nof women and children--viz., manual labour, mechanical labour, pauper\r\nlabour, and philanthropic labour.\r\n\r\nBy these several varieties of labour the highways and by-ways of\r\nthe entire metropolis are cleansed, with one exception--the Mews,\r\nconcerning which a few words here may not be out of place. _All_ these\r\nlocalities, whether they be what are styled Private or Gentlemen’s\r\nMews, or Public Mews, where stables, coach-houses, and dwelling-rooms\r\nabove them, may be taken by any one (a good many of such places\r\nbeing, moreover, public or partial thoroughfares); or whether they be\r\njob-masters’ or cab-proprietors’ mews; are scavenged by the occupants,\r\nfor the manure is valuable. The mews of London, indeed, constitute\r\na world of their own. They are tenanted by one class--coachmen and\r\ngrooms, with their wives and families--men who are devoted to one\r\npursuit, the care of horses and carriages; who live and associate\r\none among another; whose talk is of horses (with something about\r\nmasters and mistresses) as if to ride or to drive were the great ends\r\nof human existence, and who thus live as much together as the Jews in\r\ntheir compulsory quarters in Rome. The mews are also the “chambers” of\r\nunemployed coachmen and grooms, and I am told that the very sicknesses\r\nknown in such places have their own peculiarities. These, however, form\r\nmatter for _future_ inquiry.\r\n\r\nConcerning the private scavenging of the metropolitan mews, the\r\n_Medical Times_, of July 26, 1851, contains a letter from Mr. C.\r\nCochrane, in which that gentleman says:--\r\n\r\n“It will be found, that in all the mews throughout the metropolis,\r\nthe manure produced from each stable is packed up in a separate\r\nstack, until there is sufficient for a load for some market-gardener\r\nor farmer to remove. The groom or stable-man makes an arrangement,\r\nor agreement as it is called, with the market-gardener, to remove it\r\nat his convenience, and a gratuity of 1_s._ or 1_s._ 6_d._ per load\r\nis usually presented to the stable-man. In some places there are\r\ndung-pits containing the collectings of a fortnight’s dung, which, when\r\ndisturbed for removal, casts out an offensive effluvium, as sickening\r\nas it is disgusting to the whole neighbourhood. In consequence of\r\nthe arrangement in question, if a third party wished to buy some of\r\nthis manure, he could not get it; and if he wished to get rid of any\r\nby giving it away, the stable-man would not receive it, as it would\r\nnot be removed sufficiently quick by the farmer. The result is, that\r\nwhilst the air is rendered offensive and insalubrious, manure becomes\r\ndifficult to be removed or disposed of, and frequently is washed away\r\ninto the sewer.\r\n\r\n“Of this manure there are always (at a moderate computation) remaining\r\ndaily, in the mews and stable-yards of the metropolis, at least 2000\r\ncart-loads.\r\n\r\n“To remedy these evils, I would suggest that a brief Act of Parliament\r\nshould be passed, giving municipal and parochial authorities the\r\nsame complete control over the manure as they have over the ‘ashes,’\r\nwith the provision, that owners should have the right of removing it\r\nthemselves for their own use; but if they did not do so daily, then the\r\ncontrol to return to the above authorities, who should have the right\r\nof selling it, and placing the proceeds in the parish funds. By this\r\nsimple means immense quantities of valuable manure would be saved for\r\nthe purposes of agriculture--food would be rendered cheaper and more\r\nabundant--more people would be employed--whilst the metropolis would be\r\nrendered clean, sweet, and healthy.”\r\n\r\nI may dismiss this part of the subject with the remark, that I was\r\ninformed that the mews’ manure was in regular demand and of ready sale,\r\nbeing removed by the market-gardeners with greater facility than can\r\nstreet-dirt, which the contractors with the parishes prefer to vend by\r\nthe barge-load.\r\n\r\nHaving enumerated the four several modes of street-cleansing, I will\r\nnow proceed to point out briefly the characteristics of each class of\r\ncleansing. This will also denote the quality of the employers and the\r\nnature of the employment.\r\n\r\n1. _The Paid Manual Labourers_ constitute the bulk of those engaged\r\nin scavenging, and the chief pay-masters are the contractors. Many\r\nof these labourers consider themselves the only “regular hands,”\r\nhaving been “brought up to the business;” but unemployed or destitute\r\nlabourers or mechanics, or reduced tradesmen, will often endeavour to\r\nobtain employment in street-sweeping; this is the necessary evil of all\r\n_unskilled_ labour, for since every one can do it (without previous\r\napprenticeship), it follows that the beaten-out artisans or discarded\r\ntrade assistants, beggared tradesmen, or reduced gentlemen, must\r\nnecessarily resort to it as their only means of independent support;\r\nand hence the reason why dock labour and street labour, and indeed all\r\nthe several forms of unskilled work, have a tendency to be overstocked\r\nwith hands--the _unskilled_ occupations being, as it were, the sink for\r\nall the refuse _skilled_ labour and beggared industry of the country.\r\n\r\nThe “contractors,” like other employers, are separated by their\r\nmen into two classes--such as, in more refined callings, are often\r\ndesignated the “honourable” and “dishonourable” traders--according as\r\nthey pay or do not pay what is reputed “fair wages.”\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I heard any especial appellation given by the working\r\nscavengers to the better-paying class of employers, unless it were the\r\nexpressive style of “good-’uns.” The inferior paying class, however,\r\nare very generally known among their work-people as “scurfs.”\r\n\r\n2. _The Street-sweeping Machine Labourers._--Of the men employed as\r\n“attendant” scavengers, for so they may be termed, in connection with\r\nthese mechanical and vehicular street-sweepers, little need here be\r\nsaid, for they are generally of the class of ordinary scavengers. It\r\nmay, however, be necessary to explain that each of those machines must\r\nhave the street refuse, for the “lick-in” of the machine, swept into a\r\nstraight line wherever there is the slightest slope at the sides of a\r\nstreet towards the foot-path; the same, too, must sometimes be done, if\r\nthe pavement be at all broken, even when the progress of the machine\r\nis, what I heard, not very appropriately, termed “plain sailing.”\r\nSometimes, also, men follow the course of the street-sweeping machine,\r\nto “sweep up” any dirt missed or scattered, as the vehicle proceeds on\r\na straightforward course, for at all to diverge would be to make the\r\nlabour, where the machine alone is used, almost double.\r\n\r\n3. _The Pauper, or Parish-employed Scavengers_ present characteristics\r\npeculiarly their own, as regards open-air labour in London. They are\r\nemployed less to cleanse the streets, than to prevent their being\r\nchargeable to the poor’s rate as out-door recipients, or as inmates of\r\nthe workhouses. When paid, they receive a lower amount of wages than\r\nany other scavengers, and they are sometimes paid in food as well as\r\nin money, while a difference may be made between the wages of the\r\nmarried and of the unmarried men, and even between the married men who\r\nhave and have not children; some, again, are employed in scavenging\r\nwithout any money receipt, their maintenance in the workhouse being\r\nconsidered a sufficient return for the fruits of their toil.\r\n\r\nSome of these men are feeble, some are unskilful (even in tasks\r\nin which skill is but little of an element), and most of them are\r\ndissatisfied workmen. Their ranks comprise, or may comprise, men who\r\nhave filled very different situations in life. It is mentioned in the\r\nsecond edition of one of the publications of the National Philanthropic\r\nAssociation, “Sanatory Progress” (1850), “that the once high-salaried\r\ncashier of a West-end bank died lately in St. Pancras-workhouse;--that\r\nthe architect of several of the most fashionable West-end club-houses\r\nis now an inmate of St. James’s-workhouse;--and that the architect of\r\nSt. Pancras’ New Church lately died in a back garret in Somers-town.”\r\n“These recent instances (a few out of many)” says the writer,\r\n“prove that ‘wealth has wings,’ and that Genius and Industry have\r\nbut leaden feet, when overtaken by Adversity. A late number of the\r\n_Globe_ newspaper states that, ‘among the police constables on the\r\nGreat Western Railway, there are at present eight members of the\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons, and three solicitors;’--and the _Limerick\r\nExaminer_, a few weeks ago, announced the fact, that ‘a gentlewoman is\r\nnow an inmate of the workhouse of that city, whose husband, a few years\r\nago, filled the office of High Sheriff of the county.’”\r\n\r\nI do not know that either the cashier or the architect in the two\r\nworkhouses in question was employed as a street-sweeper.\r\n\r\nThis second class, then, are situated differently to the paid\r\nstreet-sweepers (or No. 1 of the present division), who may be\r\nconsidered, more or less, independent or self-supporting labourers,\r\nwhile the paupers are, of course, dependent.\r\n\r\n4. _The “Street Orderlies.”_--These men present another distinct body.\r\nThey are not merely in the employment, but many of them are under the\r\ncare, of the National Philanthropic Association, which was founded by,\r\nand is now under the presidency of, Mr. Cochrane. The objects of this\r\nsociety, as far as regards the street orderlies’ existence as a class\r\nof scavengers, are sufficiently indicated in its title, which declares\r\nit to be “For the Promotion of Street Cleanliness and the Employment\r\nof the Poor; so that able-bodied men may be prevented from burthening\r\nthe parish rates, and preserved independent of workhouse alms and\r\ndegradation. Supported by the contributions of the benevolent.”\r\n\r\nThe street orderlies, men and boys, are paid a fixed weekly wage, a\r\ncertain sum being stopped from those single men who reside in houses\r\nrented for them by the association, where their meals, washing, &c.,\r\nare provided. Among them are men of many callings, and some educated\r\nand accomplished persons.\r\n\r\nThe system of street orderlyism is, moreover, distinguished by one\r\nattribute unknown to any other mode; it is an effort, persevered in,\r\ndespite of many hindrances and difficulties, to amend our street\r\nscavengery, indeed to reform it altogether; so that dust and dirt may\r\nbe checked in their very origination.\r\n\r\nThe corporation, if I may so describe it, of the street orderlies,\r\npresents characteristics, again, varying from the other orders of what\r\ncan only be looked upon either as the self-supporting or pauper workers.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the several modes or methods of street-scavengery, and\r\nthey show the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_CLASSES OF STREET-SWEEPING EMPLOYERS._\r\n\r\n(1.) _Traders_, who undertake contracts for scavengery as a\r\nspeculation. Under this denomination may be classed the contractors\r\nwith parishes, districts, boards, liberties, divisions and subdivisions\r\nof parishes, markets, &c.\r\n\r\n(2.) _Parishes_, who employ the men as a matter of parochial policy,\r\nwith a view to the reduction of the rates, and with little regard to\r\nthe men.\r\n\r\n(3.) _Philanthropists_, who seek, more particularly, to benefit the\r\nmen whom they employ, while they strive to promote the public good by\r\nincreasing public cleanliness and order.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of “Traders” are the contractors with the parishes,\r\n&c., and the proprietors of the sweeping-machines, who are in the same\r\ncapacity as the “regular contractors” respecting their dealings with\r\nlabourers, but who substitute mechanical for manual operations.\r\n\r\nOf these several classes of masters engaged in the scavengery of the\r\nmetropolis I have much to say, and, for the clearer saying of it, I\r\nshall treat each of the several varieties of labour separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CONTRACTORS FOR SCAVENGERY.\r\n\r\nThe scavenging of the streets of the metropolis is performed _directly_\r\nor _indirectly_ by the authorities of the several parishes “without\r\nthe City,” who have the power to levy rates for the cleansing of the\r\nvarious districts; within the City, however, the office is executed\r\nunder the direction of the Court of Sewers.\r\n\r\nWhen the cleansing of the streets is performed indirectly by either the\r\nparochial or civic authorities, it is effected by contractors, that\r\nis to say, by traders who undertake for a certain sum to remove the\r\nstreet-refuse at stated intervals and under express conditions, and who\r\nemploy paid servants to execute the work for them. When it is performed\r\n_directly_, the authorities employ labourers, generally from the\r\nworkhouse, and usually enter into an agreement with some contractor for\r\nthe use of his carts and appliances, together with the right to deposit\r\nin his wharf or yard the refuse removed from the streets.\r\n\r\nI shall treat first of the _indirect_ mode of scavenging--that is\r\nto say, of cleansing the streets by contract--beginning with the\r\ncontractors, setting forth, as near as possible, the receipts and\r\nexpenditure in connection with the trade, and then proceeding in due\r\norder to treat of the labourers employed by them in the performance of\r\nthe task.\r\n\r\nSome of the contractors agree with the parochial or district\r\nauthorities to remove the dust from the house-bins as well as the\r\ndirt from the streets under one and the same contract; some undertake\r\nto execute these two offices under separate contracts; and some to\r\nperform only one of them. It is most customary, however, for the same\r\ncontractor to serve the parish, especially the larger parishes, in both\r\ncapacities.\r\n\r\nThere is no established or legally required _form_ of agreement between\r\na contractor and his principals; it is a bargain in which each side\r\nstrives to get the best of it, but in which the parish representatives\r\nhave often to contend against something looking like a monopoly; a very\r\ncommon occurrence in our day when capitalists choose to combine, which\r\n_is_ legal, or unnoticed, but very heinous on the part of the working\r\nmen, whose capital is only in their strength or skill. One contractor,\r\non being questioned by a gentleman officially connected with a large\r\ndistrict, as to the existence of combination, laughed at such a notion,\r\nbut said there might be “a sort of understanding one among another,” as\r\namong people who “must look to their own interests, and see which way\r\nthe cat jumped;” concluding with the undeniable assertion that “no man\r\nought reasonably to be expected to ruin himself for a parish.”\r\n\r\nThere does not appear, however, to have been any countervailing\r\nqualities on the part of the parishes to this understanding among the\r\ncontractors; for some of the authorities have found themselves, when\r\na new or a renewed contract was in question, suddenly “on the other\r\nside of the hedge.” Thus, in the south-west district of St. Pancras,\r\nthe contractor, five or six years ago, paid 100_l._ per annum for the\r\nremoval and possession of the street-dirt, &c.; but the following year\r\nthe district authorities had to pay him 500_l._ for the same labour\r\nand with the same privileges! Other changes took place, and in 1848-9\r\na contractor again paid the district 95_l._ I have shown, too, that\r\nin Shadwell the dust-contractor now _receives_ 450_l._ per annum,\r\nwhereas he formerly _paid_ 240_l._ To prove, however, that a spirit of\r\ncombination does _occasionally_ exist among these contractors, I may\r\ncite the following minute from one of the parish books.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from Minute-book, Nov. 7, 1839. Letter C, Folio 437._\r\n\r\n  “Commissioner’s Office,\r\n\r\n  “30, Howland-street,\r\n\r\n  “Nov. 7, 1839.\r\n\r\n   “REPORT of the Paving Committee to the General Board, relating to the\r\n   watering the district for the past year.\r\n\r\n “Your Committee beg leave to report that for the past three years the\r\n sums paid by contract for watering were respectively:--\r\n\r\n  “For 1836      £230\r\n    „  1837      220\r\n    „  1838      200\r\n\r\n “That in the month of February in the present year the Board advertised\r\n in the usual manner for tenders to water the district, when the\r\n following were received, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Darke       £315\r\n    „  Gore         318\r\n    „  Nicholls     312\r\n    „  Starkey      285\r\n\r\n which was the lowest.\r\n\r\n “Your Committee, anxious to prevent any increase in the watering-rate\r\n from being levied, and considering the amount required by the\r\n contractors for this service as excessive and exorbitant, and even\r\n evincing a spirit of combination, resolved to make an inroad upon this\r\n system, and after much trouble and attention adopted other measures for\r\n watering the district, the results of which they have great pleasure\r\n in presenting to the Board, by which it will be seen that a saving\r\n over the very lowest of the above tenders of 102_l._ 3_s._ has been\r\n effected; the sum of 18_l._ 18_s._ has been paid for pauper labour\r\n at the same time. Your Committee regret that, notwithstanding the\r\n efforts of themselves and their officers, the state of insubordination\r\n and insult of most of the paupers (in spite of all encouragement to\r\n industry) was such, that the Committee, on the 12th of July last, were\r\n reluctantly compelled to discontinue their services. The Committee\r\n cannot but congratulate the Board upon the result of their experiment,\r\n which will have the effect of breaking up a spirit of combination\r\n highly dangerous to the community at large, at the same time that their\r\n labours have caused a very considerable saving to the ratepayers; and\r\n they trust the work, considering all the numerous disadvantages under\r\n which they have laboured, has been performed in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n  “P.

It will be\r\nseen that in the regulations I quote every street, court, or alley,\r\nmust now be swept _daily_, a practice which has only been adopted\r\nwithin these few years in the City.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “SEWERS’ OFFICE, GUILDHALL, LONDON, RAKERS’ DUTIES,[15] MIDSUMMER,\r\n   1851, TO MIDSUMMER, 1852.\r\n\r\n “_CLEANSING._\r\n\r\n “_The whole surface_ of every Carriage-way, Court, and Alley shall\r\n be swept _every day_ (Sundays excepted), and all mud, dust, filth,\r\n and rubbish, all frozen or partially frozen matter, and snow, animal\r\n and vegetable matter, and everything offensive or injurious, shall be\r\n properly pecked, scraped, swept up, and carted away therefrom; and\r\n the iron gutters laid across or along the footways, the air-grates\r\n over the sewers, the gulley-grates in the carriage-way of the streets\r\n respectively; and all public urinals are to be daily raked out, swept,\r\n and made clean and clear from all obstructions; and the Contractor or\r\n Contractors shall, in time of frost, continually keep the channels in\r\n the Streets and Places clear for water to run off: and cleanse and cart\r\n away refuse hogan or gravel (when called upon by the Inspector to do\r\n so) from all streets newly paved.\r\n\r\n “The Mud and Dirt, &c., is to be carted away immediately that it is\r\n swept up.\r\n\r\n “N.B.

In times of frost and snow these hours of executing the work may\r\n be extended at the discretion of the Local Commissioners.”\r\n\r\nThe other conditions relate to the removal of the dust from the houses\r\n(a subject I have already treated), and specify the fines, varying\r\nfrom 1_l._ to 5_l._, to be paid by the contractors, for the violation\r\nor neglect of any of the provisions of the contract. It is further\r\nrequired that “Each Foreman, Sweeper, and Dustman, in the employ of\r\neither of the Contractors,” (of whom there are four, Messrs. Sinnott,\r\nRooke, Reddin, and Gould), “will be required to wear a Badge on the arm\r\nwith these words thereon,--\r\n\r\n  “‘London Sewers,\r\n  N^o. --\r\n  Guildhall,’\r\n\r\nby which means any one having cause of complaint against any of the men\r\nin the performance of their several duties, may, by taking down the\r\nnumber of the man and applying at the Sewers’ Office, Guildhall, have\r\nreference to his name and employer.\r\n\r\n“Any man working without his Badge, for each day he offends, the\r\nContractor is liable to the penalty of Five Shillings.\r\n\r\n“All the sweepings of the Streets, and all the dust and ashes from the\r\nHouses, are to be entirely carted away from the City of London, on a\r\nPenalty of _Ten Pounds_ for each cart-load.”\r\n\r\nThese terms sufficiently show the general nature of the contracts\r\nin question; the principal difference being that in some parts, the\r\ncontractor is not required to sweep the streets more than once, twice,\r\nor thrice a week in ordinary weather.\r\n\r\nThe number of individuals in London styling themselves Master\r\nScavengers is 34. Of these, 10 are at present without a contract either\r\nfor dust or scavenging, and 5 have a contract for removing the dust\r\nonly; so that, deducting these two numbers, the gross number 34 is\r\nreduced to 19 scavenging contractors. Of the latter number 16 are in\r\na large way of business, having large yards, possessing several carts\r\nand some waggons, and employing a vast number of men daily in sweeping\r\nthe streets, carting rubbish, &c. The other 3 masters, however, are\r\nonly in a small way of business, being persons of more limited means.\r\nA _large_ master scavenger employs from 3 to 18 carts, and from 18 to\r\nupwards of 40 men at scavengery alone, while a small master employs\r\nonly from 1 to 3 carts and from 3 to 6 men. By the table I have given,\r\np. 186, vol. ii., it is shown that there are 52 _contracts_ between\r\nthe several district authorities and master scavengers, and nineteen\r\n_contractors_, without counting members of the same family, as distinct\r\nindividuals; this gives an average of nearly three distinct contracts\r\nper individual. The contracts are usually for a twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nAlthough the table above referred to shows but 19 contractors for\r\npublic scavenging, there are, as I have said, more, or about 24, in\r\nLondon, most of them in a “large way,” and next year some of those\r\nwho have no contracts at present may enter into agreements with the\r\nparishes. The smallness of this number, when we consider the vast\r\nextent of the metropolis, confirms the notion of the sort of monopoly\r\nand combination to which I have alluded. In the Post-Office Directory\r\nfor 1851 there are no names under the heads of Scavengers or Dustmen,\r\nbut under the head of “Rubbish Carters,” 28 are given, 9 names being\r\nmarked as “Dust Contractors” and 10 as “Nightmen.”\r\n\r\nOf large contractors, however, there are, as I have said, about 24,\r\nbut they may not all obtain contracts every year, and in this number\r\nare included different members of the same family or firm, who may\r\nundertake specific contracts, although in the trade it is looked upon\r\nas “one concern.” The smaller contractors were represented to me as\r\nrather more numerous than the others, and perhaps numbered 40, but\r\nit is not easy to define what is to be accounted a contractor. In\r\nthe table given in pp. 213, 214, I cite only 7 as being the better\r\nknown. The others may be considered as small rubbish-carters and\r\nflying-dustmen.\r\n\r\nThere are yet other transactions in which the contractors are engaged\r\nwith the parishes, independently of their undertaking the whole labour\r\nof street and house cleansing. In the parishes where pauper, or “poor”\r\nlabour is resorted to--for it is not always that the men employed by\r\nthe parishes are positive “paupers,” but rather the unemployed poor of\r\nthe parish--in such parishes, I say, an agreement is entered into with\r\na contractor for the deposit of the collected street dirt at his yard\r\nor wharf. For such deposit the contractor must of course be paid, as it\r\nis really an occupation and renting of a portion of his premises for\r\na specific purpose. The street dirt, however, is usually left to the\r\ndisposal of the contractor, for his own profit, and where he once paid\r\n50_l._ for the possession of the street-collected dirt of a parish,\r\ncollected by labour which was no cost to him, he may now _receive_ half\r\nof such 50_l._, or whatever the terms of the agreement may be. I heard\r\nof one contractor who lately received 25_l._ where he once paid 50_l._\r\n\r\nIn another way, too, contractors are employed by parishes. Where pauper\r\nor poor labour in street cleansing is the practice, a contractor’s\r\nhorses, carts, and cart-drivers are hired for the conveyance of the\r\ndirt from the streets. This of course is for a specific payment, and is\r\nin reality the work of the tradesmen who in the Post Office Directory\r\nare described as “Rubbish Carters,” and of whom I shall have to speak\r\nafterwards. Some parishes or paving boards have, however, their own\r\nhorses and vehicles, but in the other respects they have dealings with\r\nthe contractors.\r\n\r\nTo come to as correct a conclusion as possible in this complicated\r\nand involved matter, I have obtained the aid of some gentlemen long\r\nfamiliar with such procedures. One of them said that to procure the\r\naccounts of such transactions for a series of years, with all their\r\nchops and changes, or to obtain a perfectly precise return, for any\r\nthree years, affecting the whole metropolis, would be the work of a\r\nparliamentary commission with full powers “to send for papers,” &c.,\r\n&c., and that even _then_ the result might not be satisfactory as a\r\nclear exposition. However, with the aid of the gentlemen alluded to, I\r\nventure upon the following approximation.\r\n\r\nAs my present inquiry relates only to the Scavenging Contractors in\r\nthe metropolis, I will take the number of districts, markets, &c.,\r\nwhich are specified in the table, p. 186, vol. ii. These are 83 in\r\nnumber, of which 29 are shown to be scavenged by the “parish.” I will\r\nnot involve in this computation any of the more rural places which may\r\nhappen to be in the outskirts of the metropolitan area, but I will take\r\nthe contracts as 54, where the contractors do the entire work, and as\r\n29 where they are but the rubbish-carters and dirt receivers of the\r\nparishes.\r\n\r\nI am assured that it is a fair calculation that the scavengery of the\r\nstreets, apart from the removal of the dust from the houses, costs\r\nin payments to the contractors, 150_l._ as an average, to each of\r\nthe several 54 districts; and that in the 29 localities in which the\r\nstreets are cleansed by parish labour, the sum paid is at the rate of\r\n50_l._ per locality, some of them, as the five districts of Marylebone\r\nfor instance, being very large. This is calculated regardless of the\r\ncases where parishes may have their own horses and vehicles, for the\r\ncost to the rate-payers may not be very materially different, between\r\npaying for the hire of carts and horses, and investing capital in their\r\npurchase and incurring the expense of wear and tear. The account then\r\nstands thus:--\r\n\r\n  Parish payment on 54 contracts, 150_l._ each    £8100\r\n  Parish payment on 29 contracts, 50_l._  each     1450\r\n                                                  -----\r\n  Yearly total sum paid for Scavenging of\r\n  the Metropolis                                  £9550\r\n                                                  -----\r\n\r\nor, apportioned among 19 _contractors_, upwards of 500_l._ each; and\r\namong 83 _contracts_, about 115_l._ per _contract_. Even if other\r\ncontractors are employed where parish labour is pursued, the cost\r\nto the rate-payers is the same. This calculation is made, as far as\r\npossible, as regards scavengery alone; and is independent of the value\r\nof the refuse collected. It is about the scavengery that the grand\r\nfight takes place between the parishes and contractors; the house dust,\r\nbeing uninjured by rain or street surface-water, is more available for\r\ntrade purposes.\r\n\r\nFrom this it would appear that the cost of cleansing the streets of\r\nLondon may be estimated in round numbers at 10,000_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nThe next point in the inquiry is, What is the value of the street dirt\r\nannually collected?\r\n\r\nThe price I have adduced for the dirt gained from the streets is 3_s._\r\nper load, which is a very reasonable average. If the load be dung,\r\nor even chiefly dung, it is worth 5_s._ or 6_s._ With the proportion\r\nof dung and street refuse to be found in such a thoroughfare as the\r\nHaymarket, in dry, or comparatively dry weather, a load, weighing about\r\na ton, is worth about 3_s._ in the purchaser’s own cart. On the other\r\nhand, as I have shown that quantities of mixed or slop “mac” have to be\r\nwasted, that some is sold at a nominal price, and a good deal at 1_s._\r\nthe load, 3_s._ is certainly a fair average.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TABLE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF MEN AND CARTS EMPLOYED IN COLLECTING\r\nDUST, IN SCAVENGERY, AND AT RUBBISH CARTING, AS WELL AS THE NUMBER\r\nOF MEN, WOMEN, AND BOYS WORKING IN THE DUST-YARDS OF THE SEVERAL\r\nMETROPOLITAN CONTRACTORS.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------+------------------+-------------------+------------------+----------------------------\r\n  Contractors (Large).          |       Dust.      |    Scavengery.    | Rubbish Carting. |    Working in the Yard.\r\n                                +---------+--------+---------+----------------------------+---------+---------+--------\r\n                                |         |        |         | Number  |         |        |         |         |\r\n                                |         |        |         |of Carts,|         |        |         |         |\r\n                                | Number  | Number | Number  | Waggons,| Number  | Number | Number  | Number  | Number\r\n                                | of Men  |of Carts| of Men  |    or   | of Men  |of Carts| of Men  |of Women |of Boys\r\n                                |employed.|  used. |employed.| Machines|employed.|  used. |employed.|employed.|working.\r\n                                |         |        |         |  used.  |         |        |         |         |\r\n  ------------------------------+---------+--------+---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+---------+--------\r\n  Mr. Dodd                      |    20   |   10   |    26   |    13   |    20   |   20   |    9    |    12   |   4\r\n   „  Gould                     |    20   |   10   |    28   |    11   |    11   |   11   |    5    |    15   |   4\r\n   „  Redding                   |    32   |   16   |    41   |    18   |    22   |   22   |    5    |    12   |   4\r\n   „  Gore                      |    32   |   16   |    18   |     7   |   none. |  none. |    4    |    20   |   6\r\n   „  Rooke                     |    16   |    8   |    16   |     6   |    16   |   16   |    2    |     6   |   3\r\n   „  Stapleton & Holdsworth    |    10   |    5   |    11   |     8   |    10   |   10   |    4    |     8   |   2\r\n   „  Tame                      |    20   |   10   |     5   |     1   |    12   |   12   |    4    |     8   |   2\r\n   „  Starkey                   |    10   |    5   |    22   |     8   |  none.  |  none. |    4    |    12   |   3\r\n   „  Newman                    |     8   |    4   |    23   |    10   |     8   |    8   |    4    |     8   |   2\r\n   „  Pratt and Sewell          |    10   |    5   |     4   |     2   |    20   |    20  |    2    |     6   |   2\r\n   „  W.

As, however, the whole of the parish-collected manure\r\ndoes not come into the hands of the contractors, it will be fair, I am\r\nassured, to compute the total at 19,000_l._, a sum of 1000_l._ to each\r\ncontractor, or nearly 229_l._ on each contract.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, then, that the total receipts of the contractors for\r\nthe scavenging of London amount to very nearly 30,000_l._; that is to\r\nsay, 10,000_l._ as remuneration for the office, and 20,000_l._ as the\r\nvalue of the dirt collected. But against this sum as received, we have\r\nto set the gross expense of wages paid to men, wear and tear of carts\r\nand appliances, rent of wharfs, interest for money, &c.\r\n\r\nConcerning the amount paid in wages, it appears by the table at pp.\r\n186, 187, that the men employed by the scavenging contractors in wet\r\nweather, are 260 daily (being nearly half of the whole force of 531\r\nmen, the orderlies excepted). In dry weather, however, there are only\r\n194 men employed. I will therefore calculate upon 194 men employed\r\ndaily, and 66 employed half the year, making the total of 260. By the\r\ntable here given, it will be seen that the total number of scavengers\r\nemployed by the large and small contractors, is 275.\r\n\r\n  --------------------+--------------+-------------\r\n     Number of Men.   | Weekly Wage. |  Yearly.\r\n  --------------------+--------------+-------------\r\n  194 (for 12 months) |   16_s._[17]  |£8070  8_s._\r\n   66 (for 6 months)  |   16_s._     | 1372 16_s._\r\n  --------------------+--------------+-------------\r\n          Total       |              | £9443 4_s._\r\n  --------------------+--------------+-------------\r\n\r\nThere remains now to show the amount of capital which a large\r\ncontractor must embark in his business: I include the amount of rent,\r\nand the expenditure on what must be provided for business purposes, and\r\nwhich is subject to wear and tear, to decay, and loss.\r\n\r\nThere are not now, I am told, more than twelve scavengers’ wharfs\r\nand 20 yards (the wharf being also a yard) in the possession of the\r\ncontractors in regular work. These are the larger contractors, and\r\ntheir capital, I am assured, may be thus estimated:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL OF THE MASTER SCAVENGERS.\r\n\r\n                                      £   _s._  _d._\r\n\r\n  179 Carts, 21_l._ each           3,759    0     0\r\n    3 Waggons, 32_l._ each            96    0     0\r\n  230 Horses, 25_l._ each          5,750    0     0\r\n  230 Sets of harness, 2_l._ each    460    0     0\r\n  600 Brooms, 9_d._ each              22   10     0\r\n  300 Shovels, 1_s._ each             15    0     0\r\n  100 Barges, 50_l._ each          5,000    0     0\r\n                                  -----------------\r\n  Total                           15,102   10     0\r\n                                  -----------------\r\n\r\nI have estimated according to what may be the _present_ value, not the\r\noriginal cost, of the implements, vehicles, &c.

Including,\r\nthen, the payments from parishes, the account will stand thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\nYEARLY RECEIPTS OF MASTER SCAVENGERS.\r\n\r\n  From Parishes               £9,450\r\n  From Manure, &c.            19,000\r\n                             -------\r\n  Total Income               £28,450\r\n  Deduct yearly Expenditure   25,000\r\n                             -------\r\n  Profit                      £3,450\r\n                             -------\r\n\r\nThis gives a profit of nearly 182_l._ to each contractor, if\r\nequally apportioned, or a little more than 41_l._ on each contract\r\nfor street-scavenging alone, and a profit no doubt affected by\r\ncircumstances which cannot very well be reduced to figures. The profit\r\nmay appear small, but it should be remembered that it is _independent_\r\nof the profits on the dust.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CONTRACTORS’ (OR EMPLOYERS’) PREMISES, &C.\r\n\r\nAt page 171 of the present volume I have described one of the yards\r\ndevoted to the trade in house-dust, and I have little to say in\r\naddition regarding the premises of the contracting or employing\r\nscavengers. They are the same places, and the industrious pursuits\r\ncarried on there, and the division and subdivision of labour, relate\r\nfar more to the dustmen’s department than to the scavengers’. When the\r\nproduce of the sweeping of the streets has been thrown into the cart,\r\nit is so far ready for use that it has not to be sifted or prepared, as\r\nhas the house-dust, for the formation of brieze, &c., the “mac” being\r\nsifted by the purchaser.\r\n\r\nThese yards or wharfs are far less numerous and better conducted now\r\nthan they were ten years ago. They are at present fast disappearing\r\nfrom the banks of the Thames (there is, however, one still at\r\nWhitefriars and one at Milbank). They are chiefly to be found on the\r\nbanks of the canals. Some of the principal wharfs near Maiden-lane, St.\r\nPancras, are to be found among unpaven, or ill-paved, or imperfectly\r\nmacadamized roads, along which run rows of what were once evidently\r\npleasant suburban cottages, with their green porches and their trained\r\nwoodbine, clematis, jasmine, or monthly roses; these tenements,\r\nhowever, are now occupied chiefly by the labourers at the adjacent\r\nstone, coal, lime, timber, dust, and general wharfs. Some of the\r\ncottages still presented, on my visits, a blooming display of dahlias\r\nand other autumnal flowers; and in one corner of a very large and very\r\nblack-looking dust-yard, in which rose a huge mound of dirt, was the\r\ncottage residence of the man who remained in charge of the wharf all\r\nnight, and whose comfortable-looking abode was embedded in flowers,\r\nblooming luxuriantly. The gay-tinted holly-hocks and dahlias are in\r\nstriking contrast with the dinginess of the dust-yards, while the canal\r\nflows along, dark, sluggish, and muddy, as if to be in keeping with the\r\nwharf it washes.\r\n\r\nThe dust-yards must not be confounded with the “night-yards,” or the\r\nplaces where the contents of the cess-pools are deposited, places\r\nwhich, since the passing of the Sanatory Act, are rapidly disappearing.\r\n\r\nUpon entering a dust-yard there is generally found a heavy oppressive\r\nsort of atmosphere, more especially in wet or damp weather. This is\r\nowing to the tendency of charcoal to absorb gases, and to part with\r\nthem on being saturated with moisture. The cinder-heaps of the several\r\ndust-yards, with their million pores, are so many huge gasometers\r\nretaining all the offensive gases arising from the putrefying organic\r\nmatters which usually accompany them, and parting with such gases\r\nimmediately on a fall of rain. It would be a curious calculation\r\nto estimate the quantity of deleterious gas thus poured into the\r\natmosphere after a slight shower.\r\n\r\nThe question has been raised as to the propriety of devoting some\r\nspecial locality to the purposes of dust-yards, and it is certainly a\r\nquestion deserving public attention.\r\n\r\nThe chief disposal of the street manure is from barges, sent by the\r\nThames or along the canals, and sold to farmers and gardeners. In the\r\nlarger wharfs, and in those considered removed from the imputation of\r\n“scurfdom,” six men, and often but four, are employed to load a barge\r\nwhich contains from 30 to 40 tons. In such cases the dust-yard and the\r\nwharf are one and the same place. The contents of these barges are\r\nmixed, about one-fourth being “mac,” the rest street-mud and dung.\r\nThis admixture, on board the vessel, is called by the bargemen and the\r\ncontractors’ servants at the wharfs Leicester (properly Læsta, a load).\r\nWe have the same term at the end of our word bal-_last_.\r\n\r\nI am assured by a wharfinger, who has every means of forming a correct\r\njudgment, it may be estimated that there are dispatched from the\r\ncontractors’ wharfs twelve barges daily, freighted with street-manure.\r\nThis is independent of the house-dust barged to the country\r\nbrick-fields. The weight of the cargo of a barge of manure is about\r\n40 tons; 36 tons being a low average. This gives 3744 barge-loads, or\r\n132,784 tons, or loads, yearly; for it must be recollected that the\r\ndirt gathered by pauper labour is dispatched from the contractors’\r\nyards or wharfs, as well as that collected by the immediate servants\r\nof the contractors. The price per barge-load at the canal, basin, or\r\nwharf, in the country parts where agriculture flourishes, is from 5_l._\r\nto 6_l._, making a total of 20,594_l._ The difference of that sum, and\r\nthe total given in the table (21,147_l._) may be accounted for on the\r\nsupposition that the remainder is sold in the yards and carted away\r\nthence. The slop and valueless dirt is not included in this calculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE WORKING SCAVENGERS UNDER THE CONTRACTORS.\r\n\r\nI have now to deal with what throughout the whole course of my inquiry\r\ninto the state of London Labour and the London Poor I have considered\r\nthe great object of investigation--the condition and characteristics of\r\nthe working men; and what is more immediately the “labour question,”\r\nthe relation of the labourer to his employer, as to rates of payment,\r\nmodes of payment, hiring of labourers, constancy or inconstancy of\r\nwork, supply of hands, the many points concerning wages, perquisites,\r\nfamily work, and parochial or club relief.\r\n\r\nFirst, I shall give an account of the class employment, together with\r\nthe labour season and earnings of the labourers, or “economical” part\r\nof the subject. I shall then pass to the social points, concerning\r\ntheir homes, general expenditure, &c., and then to the more moral and\r\nintellectual questions of education, literature, politics, religion,\r\nmarriage, and concubinage of the men and of their families. All this\r\nwill refer, it should be remembered, only to the working scavagers in\r\nthe honourable or better-paid trade; the cheaper labourers I shall\r\ntreat separately as a distinct class; the details in both cases I shall\r\nillustrate with the statement of men of the class described.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this multifarious subject appertains to the division\r\nof labour. This in the scavaging trade consists rather of that kind of\r\n“gang-work” which Mr. Wakefield styles “simple co-operation,” or the\r\nworking together of a number of people at the same thing, as opposed\r\nto “complex co-operation,” or the working together of a number at\r\n_different branches_ of the same thing. Simple co-operation is of\r\ncourse the ruder kind; but even this, rude as it appears, is far from\r\nbeing barbaric. “The savages of New Holland,” we are told, “never help\r\neach other even in the most simple operations; and their condition is\r\nhardly superior--in some respects it is inferior--to that of the wild\r\nanimals which they now and then catch.”\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the advantages of “simple co-operation,” Mr.\r\nWakefield tells us that “in a vast number of simple operations\r\nperformed by human exertion, it is quite obvious that two men working\r\ntogether will do more than four, or four times four men, each of whom\r\nshould work alone. In the lifting of heavy weights, for example, in the\r\nfelling of trees, in the gathering of much hay and corn during a short\r\nperiod of fine weather, in draining a large extent of land during the\r\nshort season when such a work may be properly conducted, in the pulling\r\nof ropes on board ship, in the rowing of large boats, in some mining\r\noperations, in the erection of a scaffolding for a building, and in the\r\nbreaking of stones for the repair of a road, so that the whole road\r\nshall always be kept in good repair--in all these simple operations,\r\nand thousands more, it is absolutely necessary that many persons should\r\nwork together at the same time, in the same place, and in the same way.”\r\n\r\nTo the above instances of simple co-operation, or gang-working, as it\r\nmay be briefly styled in Saxon English, Mr. Wakefield might have added\r\ndock labour and scavaging.\r\n\r\nThe principle of complex co-operation, however, is not entirely unknown\r\nin the public cleansing trade. This business consists of as many\r\nbranches as there are distinct kinds of refuse, and these appear to be\r\nfour. There are (1) the wet and (2) the dry _house_-refuse (or dust and\r\nnight-soil), and (3) the wet and (4) the dry _street_-refuse (or mud\r\nand rubbish); and in these four different branches of the one general\r\ntrade the principle of complex co-operation is found commonly, though\r\nnot invariably, to prevail.\r\n\r\nThe difference as to the class employments of the general body\r\nof public cleansers--the dustmen, street-sweepers, nightmen, and\r\nrubbish-carters--seems to be this:--any nightman will work as a dustman\r\nor scavager; but it is not all the dustmen and scavagers who will work\r\nas nightmen. The reason is almost obvious. The avocations of the\r\ndustman and the nightman are in some degree hereditary. A rude man\r\nprovides for the future maintenance of his sons in the way which is\r\nmost patent to his notice; he makes the boy share in his own labour,\r\nand grow up unfit for anything else.\r\n\r\nThe regular working scavagers are then generally a distinct class from\r\nthe working dustmen, and are all paid by the week, while the dustmen\r\nare paid by the load. In very wet weather, when there is a great\r\nquantity of “slop” in the streets, a dustman is often called upon to\r\nlend a helping hand, and sometimes when a working scavager is out of\r\nemploy, in order to keep himself from want, he goes to a “job of dust\r\nwork,” but seldom from any other cause.\r\n\r\nIn a parish where there is a crowded population, the dustman’s labours\r\nconsume, on an average, from six to eight hours a day. In scavagery,\r\nthe average hours of daily work are twelve (Sundays of course\r\nexcepted), but they sometimes extended to fifteen, and even sixteen\r\nhours, in places of great business traffic; while in very fine dry\r\nweather, the twelve hours may be abridged by two, three, four, or even\r\nmore. Thus it is manifest that the consumption of time alone prevents\r\nthe same working men being simultaneously dustmen and scavagers. In the\r\nmore remote and quiet parishes, however, and under the management of\r\nthe smaller contractors, the opposite arrangement frequently exists;\r\nthe operative is a scavager one day, and a dustman the next. This is\r\nnot the case in the busier districts, and with the large contractors,\r\nunless exceptionally, or on an emergency.\r\n\r\nIf the scavagers or dustmen have completed their street and house\r\nlabours in a shorter time than usual, there is generally some sort\r\nof employment for them in the yards or wharfs of the contractors,\r\nor they may sometimes avail themselves of their leisure to enjoy\r\nthemselves in their own way. In many parts, indeed, as I have shown,\r\nthe street-sweeping must be finished by noon, or earlier.\r\n\r\nConcerning the _division of labour_, it may be said, that the principle\r\nof complex co-operation in the scavaging trade exists only in its\r\nrudest form, for the characteristics distinguishing the labour of the\r\nworking scavagers are far from being of that complicated nature common\r\nto many other callings.\r\n\r\nAs regards the act of sweeping or scraping the streets, the labour is\r\nperformed by the _gangsman_ and his _gang_. The gangsman usually loads\r\nthe cart, and occasionally, when a number are employed in a district,\r\nacts as a foreman by superintending them, and giving directions; he is\r\na working scavager, but has the office of overlooker confided to him,\r\nand receives a higher amount of wage than the others.\r\n\r\nFor the completion of the street-work there are the _one-horse carmen_\r\nand the _two-horse carmen_, who are also working scavagers, and so\r\ncalled from their having to load the carts drawn by one or two horses.\r\nThese are the men who shovel into the cart the dirt swept or scraped\r\nto one side of the public way by the gang (some of it mere slop),\r\nand then drive the cart to its destination, which is generally their\r\nmaster’s yard. Thus far only does the street-labour extend. The carmen\r\nhave the care of the vehicles in cleaning them, greasing the wheels,\r\nand such like, but the horses are usually groomed by stablemen, who are\r\nnot employed in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe division of labour, then, among the working scavagers, may be said\r\nto be as follows:--\r\n\r\n1st. The _ganger_, whose office it is to superintend the gang, and\r\nshovel the dirt into the cart.\r\n\r\n2nd. The gang, which consists of from three to ten or twelve men, who\r\nsweep in a row and collect the dirt in heaps ready for the ganger to\r\nshovel into the cart.\r\n\r\n3rd. The carman (one-horse or two-horse, as the case may be), who\r\nattends to the horse and cart, brushes the dirt into the ganger’s\r\nshovel, and assists the ganger in wet sloppy weather in carting the\r\ndirt, and then takes the mud to the place where it is deposited.\r\n\r\nThere is only one _mode of payment_ for the above labours pursued among\r\nthe master scavagers, and that is by the week.\r\n\r\n1st. The ganger receives a weekly salary of 18_s._ when working for an\r\n“honourable” master; with a “scurf,” however, the ganger’s pay is but\r\n16_s._ a week.\r\n\r\n2nd. The gang receive in a large establishment each 16_s._ per week,\r\nbut in a small one they usually get from 14_s._ to 15_s._ a week. When\r\nworking for a small master they have often, by working over hours, to\r\n“make eight days to the week instead of six.”\r\n\r\n3rd. The one-horse carman receives 16_s._ a week in a large, and 15_s._\r\nin a small establishment.\r\n\r\n4th. The two-horse carman receives 18_s._ weekly, but is employed only\r\nby the larger masters.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page I give a table on this point.\r\n\r\nSome of these men are paid by the day, some by the week, and some on\r\nWednesdays and Saturdays, perhaps in about equal proportions, the\r\n“casuals” being mostly paid by the day, and the regular hands (with\r\nsome exceptions among the scurfs) once or twice a week. The chance\r\nhands are sometimes engaged for a half day, and, as I was told, “jump\r\nat a bob and a joey (1_s._ 4_d._), or at a bob.” I heard of one\r\ncontractor who not unfrequently said to any foreman or gangsman who\r\nmentioned to him the applications for work, “O, give the poor devils a\r\nturn, if it’s only for a day now and then.”\r\n\r\n_Piece-work_, or, as the scavagers call it, “by the load,” _did_ at one\r\ntime prevail, but not to any great extent. The prices varied, according\r\nto the nature and the state of the road, from 2_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ the\r\nload. The system of piece-work was never liked by the men; it seems\r\nto have been resorted to less as a system, or mode of labour, than to\r\ninsure assiduity on the part of the working scavagers, when a rapid\r\nstreet-cleansing was desirable. It was rather in the favour of the\r\nworking man’s _individual_ emoluments than otherwise, as may be shown\r\nin the following way. In Battle-bridge, four men collect five loads\r\nin dry, and six men seven loads in wet weather. If the average piece\r\nhire be 2_s._ 3_d._ a load, it is 2_s._ 9-3/4_d._ for each of the five\r\nmen’s day’s work; if 2_s._ 2_d._ a load, it is 2_s._ 8-1/2_d._ (the\r\nregular wage, and an extra halfpenny); if 2_s._, it is 2_s._ 6_d._; and\r\nif less (which has been paid), the day’s wage is not lower than 2_s._\r\nAt the lowest rates, however, the men, I was informed, could not be\r\ninduced to take the necessary pains, as they _would_ struggle to “make\r\nup half-a-crown;” while, if the streets were scavaged in a slovenly\r\nmanner, the contractor was sure to hear from his friends of the parish\r\nthat he was not acting up to his contract. I could not hear of any men\r\nnow set to piece-work within the precincts of the places specified in\r\nthe table. This extra work and scamping work are the two great evils of\r\nthe piece system.\r\n\r\nIn their payments to their men the contractors show a superiority to\r\nthe practices of some traders, and even of some dock-companies--the\r\nmen are never paid at public-houses; the payment, moreover, is always\r\nin money. One contractor told me that he would like all his men to be\r\nteetotallers, if he could get them, though he was not one himself.\r\n\r\nBut these remarks refer only to the _nominal_ wages of the scavagers;\r\nand I find the nominal wages of operatives in many cases are widely\r\ndifferent (either from some additions by way of perquisites, &c.,\r\nor deductions by way of fines, &c., but oftener the latter) from\r\nthe _actual_ wages received by them. Again, the average wages, or\r\ngross yearly income of the casually-employed men, are very different\r\nfrom those of the constant hands; so are the gains of a particular\r\nindividual often no criterion of the general or average earnings of\r\nthe trade. Indeed I find that the several varieties of wages may be\r\nclassified as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. _Nominal Wages._--Those said to be paid in a trade.\r\n\r\n2. _Actual Wages._--Those _really_ received, and which are equal to the\r\nnominal wages, _plus_ the additions to, or _minus_ the deductions from,\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3. _Casual Wages._--The earnings of the men who are only occasionally\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n4. _Average Casual or Constant Wages._--Those obtained throughout the\r\nyear by such as are either occasionally or regularly employed.\r\n\r\n5. _Individual Wages._--Those of particular hands, whether belonging\r\nto the scurf or honourable trade, whether working long or short hours,\r\nwhether partially or fully employed, and the like.\r\n\r\n6. _General Wages._--Or the _average_ wages of the whole trade,\r\nconstant or casual, fully or partially employed, honourable or scurf,\r\nlong and short hour men, &c., &c., all lumped together and the mean\r\ntaken of the whole.\r\n\r\nNow in the preceding account of the working scavagers’ mode and rate\r\nof payment I have spoken only of the nominal wages; and in order to\r\narrive at their actual wages we must, as we have seen, ascertain\r\nwhat additions and what deductions are generally made to and from\r\nthis amount. The deductions in the honourable trade are, as usual,\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE DIVISION OF LABOUR, MODE AND RATES OF PAYMENT,\r\nNATURE OF WORK PERFORMED, TIME UNEMPLOYED, AND AVERAGE EARNINGS OF THE\r\nOPERATIVE SCAVAGERS OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------+\r\n                           |  Mode of   |         Rates of        |                                              |\r\n    OPERATIVE SCAVAGERS.   |  Payment.  |         Payment.        |         Nature of Work performed.            |\r\n  -------------------------+------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------+\r\n                           |            |                         |                                              |\r\n   I. _Manual Labourers._  |            |                         |                                              |\r\n  A.

I heard of only one instance of an approach to it. A\r\nyard foreman, some years ago, who had a great deal of influence with\r\nhis employer, had a chandler’s-shop, managed by his wife, and it was\r\nbroadly intimated to the men that they must make their purchases there.\r\nComplaints, however, were made to the contractor, and the foreman\r\ndismissed. One man of whom I inquired did not even know what the “truck\r\nsystem” meant; and when informed, thought they were “pretty safe” from\r\nit, as the contractor had nothing which he _could_ truck with the men,\r\nand if “he polls us hisself,” the man said, “he’s not likely to let\r\nanybody else do it.”\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, no trade-payments to which the men are subjected;\r\nthere are no trade-societies among the working men, no benefit nor sick\r\nclubs; neither do parochial relief and family labour characterize the\r\nregular hands in the honourable trade, although in sickness they may\r\nhave no other resource.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the working scavagers employed by the more honourable portion\r\nof the trade, instead of having any deductions made from their nominal\r\nwages, have rather additions to them in the form of perquisites coming\r\nfrom the public. These perquisites consist of allowances of beer-money,\r\nobtained in the same manner as the dustmen--not through the medium of\r\ntheir employers (though, to say the least, through their sufferance),\r\nbut from the householders of the parish in which their labours are\r\nprosecuted.\r\n\r\nThe scavagers, it seems, are not required to sweep any places\r\nconsidered “private,” nor even to sweep the public foot-paths; and when\r\nthey _do_ sweep or carry away the refuse of a butcher’s premises, for\r\ninstance--for, by law, the butcher is required to do so himself--they\r\nreceive a gratuity. In the contract entered into by the city scavagers,\r\nit is expressly covenanted that no men employed shall accept gratuities\r\nfrom the householders; a condition little or not at all regarded,\r\nthough I am told that these gratuities become less every year. I am\r\ninformed also by an experienced butcher, who had at one time a private\r\nslaughter-house in the Borough, that, until within these six or seven\r\nyears, he thought the scavagers, and even the dustmen, would carry\r\naway entrails, &c., in the carts, from the butcher’s and the knacker’s\r\npremises, for an allowance.\r\n\r\nI cannot learn that the contractors, whether of the honourable or scurf\r\ntrade, take any advantage of these “allowances.” A working scavager\r\nreceives the same wage, when he enjoys what I heard called in another\r\ntrade “the height of perquisites,” or is employed in a locality where\r\nthere are no such additions to his wages. I believe, however, that the\r\ncontracting scavagers let their best and steadiest hands have the best\r\nperquisited work.\r\n\r\nThese perquisites, I am assured, average from 1_s._ to 2_s._ a week,\r\nbut one butcher told me he thought 1_s._ 6_d._ might be rather too high\r\nan average, for a pint of beer (2_d._) was the customary sum given, and\r\nthat was, or ought to be, divided among the gang. “In my opinion,” he\r\nsaid, “there’ll be no allowances in a year or two.” By the amount of\r\nthese perquisites, then, the scavagers’ gains are so far enhanced.\r\n\r\nThe wages, therefore, of an operative scavager in full employ, and\r\nworking for the “honourable” portion of the trade, may be thus\r\nexpressed:--\r\n\r\n  _Nominal_ weekly wages                  16_s._\r\n\r\n  Perquisites in the form of allowances\r\n  for beer from the public                 2_s._\r\n                                          ------\r\n  _Actual_ weekly wages                   18_s._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “CASUAL HANDS” AMONG THE SCAVAGERS.\r\n\r\nOf the scavagers proper there are, as in all classes of unskilled\r\nlabour, that is to say, of labour which requires no previous\r\napprenticeship, and to which any one can “turn his hand” on an\r\nemergency, two distinct orders of workmen, “the _regulars_ and\r\n_casuals_” to adopt the trade terms; that is to say, the labourers\r\nconsist of those who have been many years at the trade, constantly\r\nemployed at it, and those who have but recently taken to it as a means\r\nof obtaining a subsistence after their ordinary resources have failed.\r\nThis mixture of _constant_ and _casual_ hands is, moreover, a necessary\r\nconsequence of all trades which depend upon the seasons, and in which\r\nan additional number of labourers are required at different periods.\r\nSuch is necessarily the case with dock labour, where an easterly wind\r\nprevailing for several days deprives _thousands of work_, and where the\r\nchange from a foul to a fair wind causes an equally inordinate demand\r\nfor workmen. The same temporary increase of employment takes place\r\nin the agricultural districts at harvesting time, and the same among\r\nthe hop growers in the picking season; and it will be hereafter seen\r\nthat there are the same labour fluctuations in the scavaging trade, a\r\ngreater or lesser number of hands being required, of course, according\r\nas the season is wet or dry.\r\n\r\nThis occasional increase of employment, though a benefit in some few\r\ncases (as enabling a man suddenly deprived of his ordinary means of\r\nliving to obtain “a job of work” until he can “turn himself round”), is\r\ngenerally a most alarming evil in a State. What are the casual hands\r\nto do when the extra employment ceases? Those who have paid attention\r\nto the subject of dock labour and the subject of casual labour in\r\ngeneral, may form some notion of the vast mass of misery that must\r\nbe generally existing in London. The subject of hop-picking again\r\nbelongs to the same question. Here are thousands of the very poorest\r\nemployed only for a few days in the year. What, the mind naturally\r\nasks, do they after their short term of honest independence has ceased?\r\nWith dock labour the poor man’s bread depends upon the very winds;\r\nin scavaging and in street life generally it depends upon the rain;\r\nand in market-gardening, harvesting, hop-picking, and the like, it\r\ndepends upon the sunshine. How many thousands in this huge metropolis\r\nhave to look immediately to the very elements for their bread, it\r\nis overwhelming to contemplate; and yet, with all this fitfulness\r\nof employment we wonder that an extended knowledge of reading and\r\nwriting does not produce a decrease of crime! We should, however,\r\nask ourselves whether men can stay their hunger with alphabets or\r\ngrow fat on spelling books; and wanting employment, and consequently\r\nfood, and objecting to the _incarceration_ of the workhouse, can we\r\nbe astonished--indeed is it not a natural law--that they should help\r\nthemselves to the property of others?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConcerning the “regular hands” of the contracting scavagers, it may,\r\nperhaps, be reasonable to compute that little short of one-half of them\r\nhave been “to the manner born.” The others are, as I have said, what\r\nthese regular hands call “casuals,” or “casualties.” As an instance of\r\nthe peculiar mixture of the regular and casual hands in the scavaging\r\ntrade, I may state that one of my informants told me he had, at one\r\nperiod, under his immediate direction, fourteen men, of whom the former\r\noccupations had been as follows:--\r\n\r\n   7 Always Scavagers (or dustmen, and six\r\n       of them nightmen when required).\r\n   1 Pot-boy at a public-house (but only as a boy).\r\n   1 Stable-man (also nightman).\r\n   1 Formerly a pugilist, then a showman’s assistant.\r\n   1 Navvy.\r\n   1 Ploughman (nightman occasionally).\r\n   2 Unknown, one of them saying, but gaining\r\n       no belief, that he had once been a gentleman.\r\n  --\r\n  14\r\n\r\nIn my account of the street orderlies will be given an interesting and\r\nelaborate statement of the former avocations, the habits, expenditure,\r\n&c., of a body of street-sweepers, 67 in number. This table will be\r\nfound very curious, as showing what classes of men have been _driven_\r\nto street-sweeping, but it will not furnish a criterion of the\r\ncharacter of the “regular hands” employed by the contractors.\r\n\r\nThe “casuals” or the “casualties” (always called among the men\r\n“cazzelties”), may be more properly described as men whose employment\r\nis accidental, chanceful, or uncertain. The regular hands of the\r\nscavagers are apt to designate any new comer, even for a permanence,\r\nany sweeper not reared to or versed in the business, a casual\r\n(“cazzel”). I shall, however, here deal with the “casual hands,” not\r\nonly as hands newly introduced into the trade, but as men of chanceful\r\nand irregular employment.\r\n\r\nThese persons are now, I understand, numerous in all branches of\r\nunskilled labour, willing to undertake or attempt any kind of work,\r\nbut perhaps there is a greater tendency on the part of the surplus\r\nunskilled to turn to scavaging, from the fact that any broken-down man\r\nseems to account himself competent to sweep the streets.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the number of these casual or outside labourers in the\r\nscavaging trade is difficult, for, as I have said, they are willing\r\nin their need to attempt any kind of work, and so may be “casuals” in\r\ndivers departments of unskilled labour.\r\n\r\nI do not think that I can better approximate the number of casuals than\r\nby quoting the opinion of a contracting scavager familiar with his\r\nworkmen and their ways. He considered that there were always nearly\r\nas many hands on the look-out for a job in the streets, as there were\r\nregularly employed at the business by the large contractors; this I\r\nhave shown to be 262, let us estimate therefore the number of casuals\r\nat 200.\r\n\r\nAccording to the table I have given at pp. 213, 214, the number of\r\nmen regularly or constantly employed at the metropolitan trade is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Scavagers employed by large contractors  262\r\n    Ditto small contractors                 13\r\n    Ditto machines                          25\r\n    Ditto parishes                         218\r\n    Ditto street-orderlies                  60\r\n                                           ---\r\n      Total working scavagers in London    578\r\n\r\nBut the prior table given at pp. 186, 187, shows the number of\r\nscavagers employed throughout the metropolis in wet and dry weather\r\n(_exclusive of the street-orderlies_) to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Scavagers employed in wet weather  531\r\n    Ditto in dry weather             358\r\n                                     ---\r\n      Difference                     173\r\n\r\nHence it would appear that about one-third less hands are required\r\nin the dry than in the wet season of the year. The 170 hands, then,\r\ndischarged in the dry season are the casually employed men, but the\r\nwhole of these 170 are not turned adrift immediately they are no longer\r\nwanted, some being kept on “odd jobs” in the yard, &c.; nor can that\r\nnumber be said to represent the entire amount of the surplus labour in\r\nthe trade; but only that portion of it which _does_ obtain even casual\r\nemployment. After much trouble, and taking the average of various\r\nstatements, it would appear that the number of casualty or quantity of\r\noccasional surplus labour in the scavaging trade may be represented at\r\nbetween 200 and 250 hands.\r\n\r\nThe scavaging trade, however, is not, I am informed, so overstocked\r\nwith labourers now as it was formerly. Seven years ago, and from\r\nthat to ten, there were usually between 200 and 300 hands out of\r\nwork; this was owing to there being a less extent of paved streets,\r\nand comparatively few contractors; the scavaging work, moreover, was\r\n“scamped,” the men, to use their own phrase, “licking the work over any\r\nhow,” so that fewer hands were required. Now, however, the inhabitants\r\nare more particular, I am told, “about the crooks and corners,” and\r\nrequire the streets to be swept oftener. Formerly a gang of operative\r\nscavagers would only collect six loads of dirt a day, but now a gang\r\nwill collect nine loads daily. The causes to which the surplus of\r\nlabourers at present may be attributed are, I find, as follows:--Each\r\noperative has to do nearly double the work to what he formerly did, the\r\nextra cleansing of the streets having tended not only to employ more\r\nhands, but to make each of those employed do more work. The result has,\r\nhowever been followed by an increase in the wages of the operatives;\r\nseven years ago the labourers received but 2_s._ a day, and the ganger\r\n2_s._ 6_d._, but now the labourers receive 2_s._ 8_d._ a day, and the\r\nganger 3_s._\r\n\r\nIn the city the men have to work very long hours, sometimes as many as\r\n18 hours a day without any extra pay. This practice of overworking is,\r\nI find, carried on to a great extent, even with those master scavagers\r\nwho pay the regular wages. One man told me that when he worked for a\r\ncertain large master, whom he named, he has many times been out at work\r\n28 hours in the wet (saturated to the skin) without having any rest.\r\nThis plan of overworking, again, is generally adopted by the small\r\nmasters, whose men, after they have done a regular day’s labour, are\r\nset to work in the yard, sometimes toiling 18 hours a day, and usually\r\nnot less than 16 hours daily. Often so tired and weary are the men,\r\nthat when they rise in the morning to pursue their daily labour, they\r\nfeel as fatigued as when they went to bed. “Frequently,” said one of my\r\ninformants, “have I gone to bed so worn out, that I haven’t been able\r\nto sleep. However” (he added), “there is the work to be done, and we\r\nmust do it or be off.”\r\n\r\nThis system of overwork, especially in those trades where the quantity\r\nof work to be done is in a measure fixed, I find to be a far more\r\ninfluential cause of surplus labour than “over population.” The mere\r\nnumber of labourers in a trade is, _per se_, no criterion as to the\r\nquantity of labour employed in it; to arrive at this three things are\r\nrequired:--\r\n\r\n  (1) The number of hands;\r\n  (2) The hours of labour;\r\n  (3) The rate of labouring;\r\n\r\nfor it is a mere point of arithmetic, that if the hands in the\r\nscavaging trade work 18 hours a day, there must be one-third less men\r\nemployed than there otherwise would, or in other words one-third of the\r\nmen who are in work must be thus deprived of it. This is one of the\r\ncrying evils of the day, and which the economists, filled as they are\r\nwith their over-population theories, have entirely overlooked.\r\n\r\nThere are 262 men employed in the Metropolitan Scavaging Trade;\r\none-half of these at the least may be said to work 16 hours per diem\r\ninstead of 12, or one-third longer than they should; so that if the\r\nhours of labour in this trade were restricted to the usual day’s work,\r\nthere would be employment for one-sixth more hands, or nearly 50\r\nindividuals extra.\r\n\r\nThe other causes of the present amount of surplus labour are--\r\n\r\nThe many hands thrown out of employment by the discontinuance of\r\nrailway works.\r\n\r\nA less demand for unskilled labour in agricultural districts, or a\r\nsmaller remuneration for it.\r\n\r\nA less demand for some branches of labour (as ostlers, &c.), by the\r\nintroduction of machinery (applied to roads), or through the caprices\r\nof fashion.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be remembered, that men often found their opinions\r\nof such causes on prejudices, or express them according to their class\r\ninterests, and it is only a few employers of unskilled labourers who\r\ncare to inquire into the antecedent circumstances of men who ask for\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAs regards the population part of the question, it cannot be said\r\nthat the surplus labour of the scavaging trade is referable to any\r\ninordinate increase in the families of the men. Those who are married\r\nappear to have, on the average, four children, and about one-half of\r\nthe men have no family at all. Early marriages are by no means usual.\r\nOf the casual hands, however, full three-fourths are married, and\r\none-half have families.\r\n\r\nThere are not more than ten or a dozen Irish labourers who have taken\r\nto the scavaging, though several have “tried it on;” the regular hands\r\nsay that the Irish are too lazy to continue at the trade; but surely\r\nthe labour of the hodman, in which the Irish seem to delight, is\r\nsufficient to disprove this assertion, be the cause what it may. About\r\none-fourth of the scavagers entering the scavaging trade as casual\r\nhands have been agricultural labourers, and have come up to London from\r\nthe several agricultural districts in quest of work; about the same\r\nproportion appear to have been connected with horses, such as ostlers,\r\ncarmen, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _brisk and slack seasons_ in the scavaging trade depend upon the\r\nstate of the weather. In the depth of winter, owing to the shortness\r\nof the days, more hands are usually required for street cleansing; but\r\na “clear frost” renders the scavager’s labour in little demand. In the\r\nwinter, too, his work is generally the hardest, and the hardest of\r\nall when there is snow, which soon becomes mud in London streets; and\r\nthough a continued frost is a sort of lull to the scavagers’ labour,\r\nafter “a great thaw” his strength is taxed to the uttermost; and then,\r\nindeed, new hands have had to be put on. At the West End, in the height\r\nof the summer, which is usually the height of the fashionable season,\r\nthere is again a more than usual requirement of scavaging industry in\r\nwet weather; but perhaps the greatest exercise of such industry is\r\nafter a series of the fogs peculiar to the London atmosphere, when the\r\nmen cannot _see_ to sweep. The table I have given shows the influence\r\nof the weather, as on wet days 531 men are employed, and on dry days\r\nonly 358; this, however, does not influence the Street-Orderly system,\r\nas under it the men are employed every day, unless the weather make it\r\nan actual impossibility.\r\n\r\nAccording to the rain table given at p. 202, there would appear to be,\r\non an average of 23 years, 178 wet days in London out of the 365, that\r\nis to say, about 100 in every 205 days are “rainy ones.” The months\r\nhaving the greatest and least number of wet days are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                            No. of days in\r\n                             the month in\r\n                              which rain\r\n                                falls.\r\n  December                        17\r\n  July, August, October           16\r\n  February, May, November         15\r\n  January, April                  14\r\n  March, September                12\r\n  June                            11\r\n\r\nHence it would appear that June is the least and December the most\r\nshowery month in the course of the year; the greatest _quantity_ of\r\nrain falling in any month is, however, in October, and the least\r\nquantity in March. The number of wet days, and the quantity of rain\r\nfalling in each half of the year, may be expressed as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                Total\r\n                                    Total in    depth\r\n                                     No. of    of rain\r\n                                      wet      falling\r\n                                     days.    in inches.\r\n  The first six months in the year\r\n    ending June there are             84          10\r\n  The second six months in the\r\n    year ending December there are    93          14\r\n\r\nHence we perceive that the quantity of work for the scavagers would\r\nfluctuate in the first and last half of the year in the proportion of\r\n10 to 14, which is very nearly in the ratio of 358 to 531, which are\r\nthe numbers of hands given in table pp. 186, 187, as those employed in\r\nwet and dry weather throughout the metropolis.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the labour in the scavaging trade varies in the proportion of\r\n5 to 7, that is to say, that 5 hands are required at one period and 7\r\nat another to execute the work, the question consequently becomes, how\r\ndo the 2 casuals who are discharged out of every 7 obtain their living\r\nwhen the wet season is over?\r\n\r\nWhen a scavager is out of employ, he seldom or never applies to the\r\nparish; this he does, I am informed, only when he is fairly “beaten\r\nout” through sickness or old age, for the men “hate the thought\r\nof going to the big house” (the union workhouse). An unemployed\r\noperative scavager will go from yard to yard and offer his services\r\nto do anything in the dust trade or any other kind of employment in\r\nconnection with dust or scavaging.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, an operative scavager who is casually employed\r\nobtains work at that trade for six or eight months during the\r\nyear, and the remaining portion of his time is occupied either at\r\nrubbish-carting or brick-carting, or else he gets a job for a month or\r\ntwo in a dust-yard.\r\n\r\nMany of these men seem to form a body of street-jobbers or operative\r\nlabourers, ready to work at the docks, to be navvies (when strong\r\nenough), bricklayers’ labourers, street-sweepers, carriers of trunks\r\nor parcels, window-cleaners, errand-goers, porters, and (occasionally)\r\nnightmen. Few of the class seem to apply themselves to trading, as in\r\nthe costermonger line. They are the loungers about the boundaries of\r\ntrading, but seldom take any onward steps. The street-sweeper of this\r\nweek, a “casual” hand, may be a rubbish-carter or a labourer about\r\nbuildings the next, or he may be a starving man for days together, and\r\nthe more he is starving with the less energy will he exert himself to\r\nobtain work: “it’s not in” a starving or ill-fed man to exert himself\r\notherwise than what may be called _passively_; this is well known to\r\nall who have paid attention to the subject. The want of energy and\r\ncarelessness begotten by want of food was well described by the tinman,\r\nat p. 355 in vol. i.\r\n\r\nOne casual hand told me that last year he was out of work altogether\r\nthree months, and the year before not more than six weeks, and during\r\nthe six weeks he got a day’s work sometimes at rubbish carting and\r\nsometimes at loading bricks. Their wives are often employed in the\r\nyards as sifters, and their boys, when big enough, work also at the\r\nheap, either in carrying off, or else as fillers-in; if there are any\r\ngirls, one is generally left at home to look after the rest and get\r\nthe meals ready for the other members of the family. If any of the\r\nchildren go to school, they are usually sent to a ragged school in the\r\nneighbourhood, though they seldom attend the school more than two or\r\nthree times during the week.\r\n\r\nThe additional hands employed in wet weather are either men who at\r\nother times work in the yards, or such as have their “turns” in\r\nstreet-sweeping, if not regularly employed. There appears, however,\r\nto be little of system in the arrangement. If more hands are wanted,\r\nthe gangsman, who receives his orders from the contractor or the\r\ncontractor’s managing man, is told to put on so many new hands, and\r\nover-night he has but to tell any of the men at work that Jack, and\r\nBob, and Bill will be wanted in the morning, and they, if not employed\r\nin other work, appear accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, however, which can be designated a _labour market_\r\nappertaining to the trade. No “house of call,” no trade society. If men\r\nseek such employment, they must apply at the contractor’s premises,\r\nand I am assured that poor men not unfrequently ask the scavagers\r\nwhom they see at work in the streets where to apply “for a job,” and\r\nsometimes receive gruff or abusive replies. But though there is nothing\r\nlike a labour market in the scavager’s trade, the employers have not\r\nto “look out” for men, for I was told by one of their foremen, that he\r\nwould undertake, if necessary, which it never was, by a mere “round\r\nof the docks,” to select 200 new hale men, of all classes, and strong\r\nones, too, if properly fed, who in a few days would be tolerable\r\nstreet-sweepers. It is a calling to which agricultural labourers are\r\nglad to resort, and a calling to which _any_ labourer or any mechanic\r\nmay resort, more especially as regards sweeping or scraping, apart from\r\nshovelling, which is regarded as something like the high art of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nWe now come to estimate the earnings of the casual hands, whose yearly\r\nincomes must, of course, be very different from those of the regulars.\r\nThe _constant_ weekly wages of any workman are of course the average\r\nof his casual--and hence we shall find the wages of those who are\r\n_regularly_ employed far exceed those of the _occasionally_ employed\r\nmen:--\r\n\r\n                                          £  _s._  _d._\r\n  Nominal yearly wages at scavaging\r\n    for 25 weeks in the year, at 16_s._\r\n    per week                             20   16     0\r\n  Perquisites for 26 weeks, at 2_s._      2   12     0\r\n                                        ------------------\r\n  Actual yearly wages at scavaging       23    8     0\r\n  Nominal and actual weekly wages\r\n    at rubbish carting for 20 weeks in\r\n    the year, at 12_s._                  12    0     0\r\n  Unemployed six weeks in the year        0    0     0\r\n                                         -----------------\r\n  Gross yearly earnings                  35    8     0\r\n                                         -----------------\r\n  Average casual or constant weekly\r\n    wages throughout the year                 15     4-1/2\r\n\r\nHence the difference between the earnings of the casual and the\r\nregular hand would appear to be one-sixth. But the great evil of all\r\ncasual labour is the uncertainty of the income--for where there is\r\nthe greatest chance connected with an employment, there is not only\r\nthe greatest necessity for providence, but unfortunately the greatest\r\ntendency to improvidence. It is only when a man’s income becomes\r\nregular and fixed that he grows thrifty, and lays by for the future;\r\nbut where all is chance-work there is but little ground for reasoning,\r\nand the accident which assisted the man out of his difficulties at\r\none period is continually expected to do the same good turn for him\r\nat another. Hence the casual hand, who passes the half of the year on\r\n18_s._, and twenty weeks on 12_s._, and _six weeks on nothing_, lives\r\na life of excess both ways--of excess of “guzzling” when in work, and\r\nexcess of privation when out of it--oscillating, as it were, between\r\nsurfeit and starvation.\r\n\r\nA man who had worked in an iron-foundry, but who had “lost his work”\r\n(I believe through some misconduct) and was glad to get employment as\r\na street-sweeper, as he had a good recommendation to a contractor,\r\ntold me that “the misery of the thing” was the want of regular work.\r\n“I’ve worked,” he said, “for a good master for four months an end at\r\n2_s._ 8_d._ a day, and they were prime times. Then I hadn’t a stroke of\r\nwork for a fortnight, and very little for two months, and if my wife\r\nhadn’t had middling work with a laundress we might have starved, or I\r\nmight have made a hole in the Thames, for it’s no good living to be\r\nmiserable and feel you can’t help yourself any how. We was sometimes\r\nhalf-starved, as it was. I’d rather at this minute have regular work at\r\n10_s._ a week all the year round, than have chance-work that I could\r\nearn 20_s._ a week at. I once had 15_s._ in relief from the parish,\r\nand a doctor to attend us, when my wife and I was both laid up sick.\r\nO, there’s no difference in the way of doing the work, whatever wages\r\nyou’re on for; the streets must be swept clean, of course. The plan’s\r\nthe same, and there’s the same sort of management, any how.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF A “REGULAR SCAVAGER.”\r\n\r\nThe following statement of his business, his sentiments, and, indeed,\r\nof the subjects which concerned him, or about which he was questioned,\r\nwas given to me by a street-sweeper, so he called himself, for I have\r\nfound some of these men not to relish the appellation of “scavager.”\r\nHe was a short, sturdy, somewhat red-faced man, without anything\r\nparticular in his appearance to distinguish him from the mass of\r\nmere labourers, but with the sodden and sometimes dogged look of a\r\nman contented in his ignorance, and--for it is not a very uncommon\r\ncase--rather proud of it.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how old I am,” he said--I have observed, by the by, that\r\nthere is not any excessive vulgarity in these men’s tones or accent\r\nso much as grossness in some of their expressions--“and I can’t see\r\nwhat that consarns any one, as I’s old enough to have a jolly rough\r\nbeard, and so can take care of myself. I should think so. My father\r\nwas a sweeper, and I wanted to be a waterman, but father--he hasn’t\r\nbeen dead long--didn’t like the thoughts on it, as he said they was\r\nall drownded one time or ’nother; so I ran away and tried my hand as a\r\nJack-in-the-water, but I was starved back in a week, and got a h---- of\r\na clouting. After that I sifted a bit in a dust-yard, and helped in any\r\nway; and I was sent to help at and larn honey-pot and other pot making,\r\nat Deptford; but honey-pots was a great thing in the business. Master’s\r\nforeman married a relation of mine, some way or other. I never tasted\r\nhoney, but I’ve heered it’s like sugar and butter mixed. The pots was\r\noften wanted to look like foreign pots; I don’t know nothing what was\r\nmeant by it; some b---- dodge or other. No, the trade didn’t suit me at\r\nall, master, so I left. I don’t know why it didn’t suit me; cause it\r\ndidn’t. Just then, father had hurt his hand and arm, in a jam again’\r\na cart, and so, as I was a big lad, I got to take his place, and gave\r\nevery satisfaction to Mr. ----. Yes, he was a contractor and a great\r\nman. I can’t say as I knows how contracting’s done; but it’s a bargain\r\natween man and man. So I got on. I’m now looked on as a stunning good\r\nworkman, I can tell you.\r\n\r\n“Well, I can’t say as I thinks sweeping the streets is hard work. I’d\r\nrather sweep two hours than shovel one. It tires one’s arms and back\r\nso, to go on shovelling. You can’t change, you see, sir, and the same\r\nparts keeps getting gripped more and more. Then you must mind your eye,\r\nif you’re shovelling slop into a cart, perticler so; or some feller\r\nmay run off with a complaint that he’s been splashed o’ purpose. _Is_\r\na man ever splashed o’ purpose? No, sir, not as I knows on, in coorse\r\nnot. [Laughing.] Why should he?\r\n\r\n“The streets _must_ be done as they’re done now. It always was so, and\r\nwill always be so. Did I ever hear what London streets were like a\r\nthousand years ago? It’s nothing to me, but they must have been like\r\nwhat they is now. Yes, there was always streets, or how was people that\r\nhas tin to get their coals taken to them, and how was the public-houses\r\nto get their beer? It’s talking nonsense, talking that way, a-asking\r\nsich questions.” [As the scavager seemed likely to lose his temper, I\r\nchanged the subject of conversation.]\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he continued, “I have good health. I never had a doctor but\r\ntwice; once was for a hurt, and the t’other I won’t tell on. Well, I\r\nthink nightwork’s healthful enough, but I’ll not say so much for it as\r\nyou may hear some on ’em say. I don’t like it, but I do it when I’s\r\nobligated under a necessity. It pays one as overwork; and werry like\r\nmore one’s in it, more one may be suited. I reckon no men works harder\r\nnor sich as me. O, as to poor journeymen tailors and sich like, I knows\r\nthey’re stunning badly off, and many of their masters is the hardest of\r\nbeggars. I have a nephew as works for a Jew slop, but I don’t reckon\r\nthat _work_; anybody might do it. You think not, sir? Werry well, it’s\r\nall the same. No, I won’t say as I could make a veskit, but I’ve sowed\r\nmy own buttons on to one afore now.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ve heered on the Board of Health. They’ve put down some\r\nnight-yards, and if they goes on putting down more, what’s to become\r\nof the night-soil? I can’t think what they’re up to; but if they don’t\r\ntouch wages, it may be all right in the end on it. I don’t know that\r\nthem there consarns does touch wages, but one’s naterally afeard on\r\n’em. I could read a little when I was a child, but I can’t now for want\r\nof practice, or I might know more about it. I yarns my money gallows\r\nhard, and requires support to do hard work, and if wages goes down,\r\none’s strength goes down. I’m a man as understands what things belongs.\r\nI was once out of work, through a mistake, for a good many weeks,\r\nperhaps five or six or more; I larned then what short grub meant. I got\r\na drop of beer and a crust sometimes with men as I knowed, or I might\r\nhave dropped in the street. What did I do to pass my time when I was\r\nout of work? Sartinly the days seemed wery long; but I went about and\r\ncalled at dust-yards, till I didn’t like to go too often; and I met men\r\nI know’d at tap-rooms, and spent time that way, and axed if there was\r\nany openings for work. I’ve been out of collar odd weeks now and then,\r\nbut when this happened, I’d been on slack work a goodish bit, and was\r\nbad for rent three weeks and more. My rent was 2_s._ a week then; its\r\n1_s._ 9_d._ now, and my own traps.\r\n\r\n“No, I can’t say I was sorry when I was forced to be idle that way,\r\nthat I hadn’t kept up my reading, nor tried to keep it up, because I\r\ncouldn’t then have settled down my mind to read; I know I couldn’t. I\r\nlikes to hear the paper read well enough, if I’s resting; but old Bill,\r\nas often wolunteers to read, has to spell the hard words so, that one\r\ncan’t tell what the devil he’s reading about. I never heers anything\r\nabout books; I never heered of Robinson Crusoe, if it wasn’t once at\r\nthe Wic. [Victoria Theatre]; I think there was some sich a name there.\r\nHe lived on a deserted island, did he, sir, all by hisself? Well, I\r\nthink, now you mentions it, I have heered on him. But one needn’t\r\nbelieve all one hears, whether out of books or not. I don’t know much\r\ngood that ever anybody as I knows ever got out of books; they’re\r\nfittest for idle people. Sartinly I’ve seen working people reading in\r\ncoffee-shops; but they might as well be resting theirselves to keep\r\nup their strength. Do I think so? I’m sure on it, master. I sometimes\r\nspends a few browns a-going to the play; mostly about Christmas. It’s\r\nwerry fine and grand at the Wic., that’s the place I goes to most; both\r\nthe pantomimers and t’ other things is werry stunning. I can’t say how\r\nmuch I spends a year in plays; I keeps no account; perhaps 5_s._ or so\r\nin a year, including expenses, sich as beer, when one goes out after a\r\nstopper on the stage. I don’t keep no accounts of what I gets, or what\r\nI spends, it would be no use; money comes and it goes, and it often\r\ngoes a d----d sight faster than it comes; so it seems to me, though I\r\nain’t in debt just at this time.\r\n\r\n“I never goes to any church or chapel. Sometimes I hasn’t clothes as\r\nis fit, and I s’pose I couldn’t be admitted into sich fine places in\r\nmy working dress. I was once in a church, but felt queer, as one does\r\nin them strange places, and never went again. They’re fittest for rich\r\npeople. Yes, I’ve heered about religion and about God Almighty. _What_\r\nreligion have I heered on? Why, the regular religion. I’m satisfied\r\nwith what I knows and feels about it, and that’s enough about it. I\r\ncame to tell you about trade and work, because Mr. ---- told me it\r\nmight do good; but religion hasn’t nothing to do with it. Yes, Mr.\r\n----’s a good master, and a religious man; but I’ve known masters as\r\ndidn’t care a d--n for religion, as good as him; and so you see it\r\ncomes to much the same thing. I cares nothing about politics neither;\r\nbut I’m a chartist.\r\n\r\n“I’m not a married man. I was a-going to be married to a young woman\r\nas lived with me a goodish bit as my housekeeper” [this he said very\r\ndemurely]; “but she went to the hopping to yarn a few shillings for\r\nherself, and never came back. I heered that she’d taken up with an\r\nIrish hawker, but I can’t say as to the rights on it. Did I fret about\r\nher? Perhaps not; but I was wexed.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I can’t say what I spends my wages in. I sometimes makes\r\n12_s._ 6_d._ a week, and sometimes better than 21_s._ with night-work.\r\nI suppose grub costs 1_s._ a day, and beer 6_d._; but I keeps no\r\naccounts. I buy ready-cooked meat; often cold b’iled beef, and eats it\r\nat any tap-room. I have meat every day; mostly more than once a day.\r\nWegetables I don’t care about, only ingans and cabbage, if you can get\r\nit smoking hot, with plenty of pepper. The rest of my tin goes for rent\r\nand baccy and togs, and a little drop of gin now and then.”\r\n\r\nThe statement I have given is sufficiently explicit of the general\r\nopinions of the “regular scavagers” concerning literature, politics,\r\nand religion. On these subjects the great majority of the regular\r\nscavagers have no opinions at all, or opinions distorted, even when\r\nthe facts seem clear and obvious, by ignorance, often united with its\r\nnearest of kin, prejudice and suspiciousness. I am inclined to think,\r\nhowever, that the man whose narrative I noted down was more dogged in\r\nhis ignorance than the body of his fellows. All the intelligent men\r\nwith whom I conversed, and whose avocations had made them familiar\r\nfor years with this class, concurred in representing them as grossly\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nThis description of the scavagers’ ignorance, &c., it must be\r\nremembered, applies only to the “regular hands.” Those who have\r\njoined the ranks of the street-sweepers from other callings are more\r\nintelligent, and sometimes more temperate.\r\n\r\nThe system of concubinage, with a great degree of fidelity in the\r\ncouple living together without the sanction of the law--such as I have\r\ndescribed as prevalent among the costermongers and dustmen--is also\r\nprevalent among the regular scavagers.\r\n\r\nI did not hear of habitual unkindness from the parents to the children\r\nborn out of wedlock, but there is habitual neglect of all or much\r\nwhich a child should be taught--a neglect growing out of ignorance. I\r\nheard of two scavagers with large families, of whom the treatment was\r\nsometimes very harsh, and at others mere petting.\r\n\r\nEducation, or rather the ability to read and write, is not common\r\namong the adults in this calling, so that it cannot be expected to be\r\nfound among their children. Some labouring men, ignorant themselves,\r\nbut not perhaps constituting a class or a clique like the regular\r\nscavagers, try hard to procure for their children the knowledge, the\r\nwant of which they usually think has barred their own progress in life.\r\nOther ignorant men, mixing only with “their own sort,” as is generally\r\nthe case with the regular scavagers, and in the several branches of\r\nthe business, often think and say that what _they_ did without their\r\nchildren could do without also. I even heard it said by one scavager\r\nthat it wasn’t right a child should ever think himself wiser than\r\nhis father. A man who knew, in the way of his business as a private\r\ncontractor for night-work, &c., a great many regular scavagers, “ran\r\nthem over,” and came to the conclusion that about four or five out of\r\ntwenty could read, ill or tolerably well, and about three out of forty\r\ncould write. He told me, moreover, that one of the most intelligent\r\nfellows generally whom he knew among them, a man whom he had heard\r\nread well enough, and always understood to be a tolerable writer, the\r\nother day brought a letter from his son, a soldier abroad with his\r\nregiment in Lower Canada, and requested my informant to read it to\r\nhim, as “that kind of writing,” although plain enough, was “beyond\r\nhim.” The son, in writing, had availed himself of the superior skill of\r\na corporal in his company, so that the letter, on family matters and\r\nfeelings, was written by deputy and read by deputy. The costermongers,\r\nI have shown, when themselves unable to read, have evinced a fondness\r\nfor listening to exciting stories of courts and aristocracies, and have\r\neven bought penny periodicals to have their contents read to them. The\r\nscavagers appear to have no taste for this mode of enjoying themselves;\r\nbut then their leisure is far more circumscribed than that of the\r\ncostermongers.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that I have all along spoken of the regular\r\n(many of them hereditary) scavagers employed by the more liberal\r\ncontractors.\r\n\r\nThere are yet accounts of habitations, statements of wages, &c., &c.,\r\nto be given, in connection with men working for the honourable masters,\r\nbefore proceeding to the scurf-traders.\r\n\r\nThe working scavagers usually reside in the neighbourhood of the\r\ndust-yards, occupying “second-floor backs,” kitchens (where the\r\nentire house is sublet, a system often fraught with great extortion),\r\nor garrets; they usually, and perhaps always, when married, or what\r\nthey consider “as good,” have their own furniture. The rent runs from\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ 3_d._ weekly, an average being 1_s._ 9_d._ or\r\n1_s._ 10_d._ One room which I was in was but barely furnished,--a\r\nsort of dresser, serving also for a table; a chest; three chairs (one\r\nalmost bottomless); an old turn-up bedstead, a Dutch clock, with the\r\nminute-hand broken, or as the scavager very well called it when he\r\nsaw me looking at it, “a stump;” an old “corner cupboard,” and some\r\npots and domestic utensils in a closet without a door, but retaining\r\na portion of the hinges on which a door had swung. The rent was 1_s._\r\n10_d._, with a frequent intimation that it ought to be 2_s._ The place\r\nwas clean enough, and the scavager seemed proud of it, assuring me that\r\nhis old woman (wife or concubine) was “a good sort,” and kept things as\r\nnice as ever she could, washing everything herself, where “other old\r\nwomen lushed.” The only ornaments in the room were three profiles of\r\nchildren, cut in black paper and pasted upon white card, tacked to the\r\nwall over the fire-place, for mantel-shelf there was none, while one of\r\nthe three profiles, that of the eldest child (then dead), was “framed,”\r\nwith a glass, and a sort of bronze or “cast” frame, costing, I was\r\ntold, 15_d._ This was the apartment of a man in regular employ (with\r\nbut a few exceptions).\r\n\r\nAnother scavager with whom I had some conversation about his labours\r\nas a nightman, for he was both, gave me a full account of his own\r\ndiet, which I find to be sufficiently specific as to that of his class\r\ngenerally, but only of the regular hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LONDON SCAVENGER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe diet of the regular working scavager (or nightman) seems generally\r\nto differ from that of mechanics, and perhaps of other working men,\r\nin the respect of his being fonder of salt and _strong-flavoured_\r\nfood. I have before made the same remark concerning the diet of\r\nthe poor generally. I do not mean, however, that the scavagers are\r\nfond of such animal food as is called “high,” for I did not hear that\r\nnightmen or scavagers were more tolerant of what approached putridity\r\nthan other labouring men, and, despite their calling, might sicken at\r\nthe rankness of some haunches of venison; but they have a great relish\r\nfor highly-salted cold boiled beef, bacon, or pork, with a saucer-full\r\nof red pickled cabbage, or dingy-looking pickled onions, or one or\r\ntwo big, strong, raw onions, of which most of them seem as fond as\r\nSpaniards of garlic. This sort of meat, sometimes profusely mustarded,\r\nis often eaten in the beer-shops with thick “shives” of bread, cut\r\ninto big mouthfuls with a clasp pocket-knife, while vegetables, unless\r\nindeed the beer-shop can supply a plate of smoking hot potatoes, are\r\nuncared for. The drink is usually beer. The same style of eating and\r\nthe same kind of food characterize the scavager and nightman, when\r\ntaking his meal at home with his wife or family; but so irregular, and\r\noften of necessity, are these men’s hours, that they may be said to\r\nhave no homes, merely places to sleep or dose in.\r\n\r\nA working scavager and nightman calculated for me his expenses in\r\neating and drinking, and other necessaries, for the previous week. He\r\nhad earned 15_s._, but 1_s._ of this went to pay off an advance of\r\n5_s._ made to him by the keeper of a beer-shop, or, as he called it, a\r\n“jerry.”\r\n\r\n                                       Daily.

I believe he was\r\nso; the others not drinking so much regularly. The odd 9_d._, he told\r\nme, he paid to “a snob,” because he said he was going to send his\r\nhalf-boots to be mended.\r\n\r\nThis man informed me he was a “widdur,” having lost his old ’oman, and\r\nhe got all his meals at a beer or coffee-shop. Sometimes, when he was\r\na street-sweeper by day and a nightman by night, he had earned 20_s._\r\nto 22_s._; and then he could have his pound of salt meat a day, for\r\n_three_ meals, with a “baked tatur or so, when they was in.” I inquired\r\nas to the apparently low charge of 6_d._ per pound for cooked meat, but\r\nI found that the man had stated what was correct. In many parts good\r\nboiled “brisket,” fresh cut, is 7_d._ and 8_d._ per lb., with mustard\r\ninto the bargain; and the cook-shop keepers (not the eating-house\r\npeople) who sell boiled hams, beef, &c., in retail, but not to be eaten\r\non the premises, vend the hard remains of a brisket, and sometimes of a\r\nround, for 6_d._, or even less (also with mustard), and the scavagers\r\nlike this better than any other food. In the brisk times my informant\r\nsometimes had “a hot cut” from a shop on a Sunday, and a more liberal\r\nallowance of beer and gin. If he had any piece of clothing to buy he\r\nalways bought it at once, before his money went for other things. These\r\nwere his proceedings when business was brisk.\r\n\r\nIn slacker times his diet was on another footing. He then made his\r\nsupper, or second meal, for tea he seldom touched, on “fagots.” This\r\npreparation of baked meats costs 1_d._ hot--but it is seldom sold\r\nhot except in the evening--and 3/4_d._, or more frequently two for\r\n1-1/2_d._, cold. It is a sort of cake, roll, or ball, a number being\r\nbaked at a time, and is made of chopped liver and lights, mixed with\r\ngravy, and wrapped in pieces of pig’s caul. It weighs six ounces, so\r\nthat it is unquestionably a cheap, and, to the scavager, a savoury\r\nmeal; but to other nostrils its odour is not seductive. My informant\r\nregretted the capital fagots he used to get at a shop when he worked\r\nin Lambeth; superior to anything he had been able to meet with on the\r\nMiddlesex side of the water. Or he dined off a saveloy, costing 1_d._,\r\nand bread; or bought a pennyworth of strong cheese, and a farthing’s\r\nworth of onions. He would further reduce his daily expenditure on\r\ncocoa (or coffee sometimes) to 1_d._, and his bread to three-quarters\r\nof a loaf. He ate, however, in average times, a quarter of a quartern\r\nloaf to his breakfast (sometimes buying a halfpennyworth of butter), a\r\nquarter or more to his dinner, the same to his supper, and the other,\r\nwith an onion for a relish, to his beer. He was a great bread eater,\r\nhe said; but sometimes, if he slept in the daytime, half a loaf would\r\n“stand over to next day.” He was always hungriest when at work among\r\nthe street-mud, or night-soil, or when he had finished work.\r\n\r\nOn my asking him if he meant that he partook of the meals he had\r\ndescribed daily, he answered “no,” but that was _mostly_ what he had;\r\nand if he bought a bit of cold boiled, or even roast pork, “what\r\noffered cheap,” the expense was about the same. When he was drinking,\r\nand he did “make a break sometimes,” he ate nothing, and “wasn’t\r\ninclined to,” and he seemed rather to plume himself on this, as a point\r\nof economy. He had tasted fruit pies, but cared nothing for them;\r\nbut liked four penn’orth of a hot meat or giblet pie on a Sunday.\r\nBatter-pudding he only liked if smoking hot; and it was “uncommon\r\nimproved,” he said, “with an ingan!” Rum he preferred to gin, only it\r\nwas dearer, but most of the scavagers, he thought, liked Old Tom (gin)\r\nbest; but “they was both good.”\r\n\r\nOf the drinking of these men I heard a good deal, and there is no\r\ndoubt that some of them tope hard, and by their conduct evince a sort\r\nof belief that the great end of labour is beer. But it must be borne\r\nin mind that if inquiries are made as to the man best adapted to give\r\ninformation concerning any rude calling (especially), some talkative\r\nmember of the body of these working men, some pot-house hero who has\r\npersuaded himself and his ignorant mates that he is an oracle, is put\r\nforward. As these men are sometimes, from being trained to, and long\r\nknown in their callings, more prosperous than their fellows, their\r\nopinions seem ratified by their circumstances. But in such cases, or in\r\nthe appearance of such cases, it has been my custom to make subsequent\r\ninquiries, or there might be frequent misleadings, were the statements\r\nof these men taken as typical of the feelings and habits of the _whole_\r\nbody. The statement of the working scavager given under this head is\r\nunquestionably typical of the character of a portion of his co-workers,\r\nand more especially of what was, and in the sort of hereditary\r\nscavagers I have spoken of _is_, the character of the regular hands.\r\nThere are now, however, many checks to prolonged indulgence in “lush,”\r\nas every man of the ruder street-sweeping class _will_ call it. The\r\ncontractors must be served regularly; the most indulgent will not\r\ntolerate any unreasonable absence from work, so that the working\r\nscavagers, at the jeopardy of their means of living, must leave their\r\ncarouse at an hour which will permit them to rise soon enough in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe beer which these men imbibe, it should be also remembered, they\r\nregard as a proper part of their diet, in the same light, indeed, as\r\nthey regard so much bread, and that among them the opinion is almost\r\nuniversal, that beer is necessary to “keep up their strength;” there\r\nare a few teetotallers belonging to the class; one man thought he\r\n_knew_ five, and had _heard_ of five others.\r\n\r\nI inquired of the landlord of a beer-shop, frequented by these men,\r\nas to their potations, but he wanted to make it appear that they took\r\na half-pint, _now and then_, when thirsty! He was evidently tender\r\nof the character of his customers. The landlord of a public house\r\nalso frequented by them informed me that he really could not say what\r\nthey expended in beer, for labourers of all kinds “used his tap,”\r\nand as all tap-room liquor was paid for on delivery in his and all\r\nsimilar establishments, he did not know the quantity supplied to any\r\nparticular class. He was satisfied these men, as a whole, drank less\r\nthan they did at one time; though he had no doubt some (he seemed to\r\nknow no distinctions between scavagers, dustmen, and nightmen) spent\r\n1_s._ a day in drink. He knew one scavager who was dozing about not\r\nlong since for nearly a week, “sleepy drunk,” and the belief was that\r\nhe had “found something.” The absence of all accounts prevents my\r\ncoming to anything definite on this head, but it seems positive that\r\nthese men drink less than they did. The landlord in question thought\r\nthe statement I have given as to diet and drink perfectly correct for a\r\nregular hand in good earnings. I am assured, however, and it is my own\r\nopinion, after long inquiry, that one-third of their earnings is spent\r\nin drink.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE INFLUENCE OF FREE TRADE ON THE EARNINGS OF THE SCAVAGERS.\r\n\r\nAs regards the influence of Free Trade upon the scavaging business, I\r\ncould gain little or no information from the body of street-sweepers,\r\nbecause they have never noticed its operation, and the men, with\r\nthe exception of such as have sunk into street-sweeping from\r\nbetter-informed conditions of life, know nothing about it. Among _all_,\r\nhowever, I have heard statements of the blessing of cheap bread; always\r\ncheap _bread_. “There’s nothing like bread,” say the men, “it’s not\r\nall poor people can get meat; but they _must_ get bread.” Cheap food\r\nall labouring men pronounce a blessing, as it unquestionably is, but\r\n“somehow,” as a scavager’s carman said to me, “the thing ain’t working\r\nas it should.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of the present and former inquiries among unskilled\r\nlabourers, street-sellers, and costermongers, I have found the great\r\nmajority of the more intelligent declare that Free Trade had not\r\nworked well for them, because there were more labourers and more\r\nstreet-sellers than were required, for each man to live by his toil and\r\ntraffic, and because the numbers increased yearly, and the demand for\r\ntheir commodities did not increase in proportion. Among the ignorant, I\r\nheard the continual answers of, “I can’t say, sir, what it’s owing to,\r\nthat I’m so bad off;” or, “Well, I can’t tell anything about that.”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to state, however, without positive inquiry, whether\r\nthis extra number of hands be due to diminished employment in the\r\nagricultural districts, since the repeal of the Corn Laws, or\r\nwhether it be due to the insufficiency of occupation generally for\r\nthe increasing population. One thing at least is evident, that the\r\nincrease of the trades alluded to cannot be said to arise directly\r\nfrom diminished agricultural employment, for but few farm labourers\r\nhave entered these businesses since the change from Protection to Free\r\nTrade. If, therefore, Free-Trade principles _have_ operated injuriously\r\nin reducing the work of the unskilled labourers, street-sellers, and\r\nthe poorer classes generally, it can have done so only _indirectly_;\r\nthat is to say, by throwing a mass of displaced country labour into\r\nthe towns, and so displacing other labourers from their ordinary\r\noccupations, as well as by decreasing the wages of working-men\r\ngenerally. Hence it becomes almost impossible, I repeat, to tell\r\nwhether the increasing difficulty that the poor experience in living by\r\ntheir labour, is a consequence or merely a concomitant of the repeal\r\nof the Corn Laws; if it be a consequence, of course the poor are no\r\nbetter for the alteration; if, however, it be a coincidence rather\r\nthan a necessary result of the measure, the circumstances of the poor\r\nare, of course, as much improved as they would have been impoverished\r\nprovided that measure had never become law. I candidly confess I am as\r\nyet without the means of coming to any conclusion on this part of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nNor can it be said that in the scavagers’ trade wages have in any way\r\ndeclined since the repeal of the Corn Laws; so that were it not for the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining employment among the _casual_ hands, this class\r\nmust be allowed to have been considerable gainers by the reduction in\r\nthe price of food, and even as it is, the _constant_ hands must be\r\nacknowledged to be so.\r\n\r\nI will now endeavour to reduce to a tabular form such information as I\r\ncould obtain as to the expenditure of the labourer in scavaging before\r\nand after the establishment of Free Trade. I inquired, the better\r\nto be assured of the accuracy of the representations and accounts I\r\nreceived from labourers, the price of meat then and now. A butcher\r\nwho for many years has conducted a business in a populous part of\r\nWestminster and in a populous suburb, supplying both private families\r\nwith the best joints, and the poor with their “little bits” their\r\n“block ornaments” (meat in small pieces exposed on the chopping-block),\r\ntheir purchases of liver, and of beasts’ heads. In 1845, the year I\r\ntake as sufficiently prior to the Free-Trade era, my informant from\r\nhis recollection of the state of his business and from consulting his\r\nbooks, which of course were a correct guide, found that for a portion\r\nof the year in question, mutton was as much as 7-1/2_d._ per lb.\r\n(Smithfield prices), now the same quality of meat is but 5_d._ This,\r\nhowever, was but a temporary matter, and from causes which sometimes\r\nare not very ostensible or explicable. Taking the butcher’s trade that\r\nyear as a whole, it was found sufficiently conclusive, that meat was\r\ngenerally 1_d._ per lb. higher then than at present. My informant,\r\nhowever, was perfectly satisfied that, although situated in the same\r\nway, and with the same class of customers, he did _not_ sell so much\r\nmeat to the poor and labouring classes as he did five or six years ago,\r\n_he believed not by one-eighth_, although perhaps “pricers of his meat”\r\namong the poor were more numerous. For this my informant accounted by\r\nexpressing his conviction that the labouring men spent their money in\r\ndrink more than ever, and were a longer time in recovering from the\r\neffects of tippling. This supposition, from what I have observed in the\r\ncourse of the present inquiry, is negatived by facts.\r\n\r\nAnother butcher, also supplying the poor, said they bought less of him;\r\nbut he could not say exactly to what extent, perhaps an eighth, and\r\nhe attributed it to less work, there being no railways about London,\r\nfewer buildings, and less general employment. About the wages of the\r\nlabourers he could not speak as influencing the matter. From this\r\ntradesmen also I received an account that meat generally was 1_d._ per\r\nlb. higher at the time specified. Pickled Australian beef was four\r\nor five years ago very low--3_d._ per lb.--salted and prepared, and\r\n“swelling” in hot water, but the poor “couldn’t eat the stringy stuff,\r\nfor it was like pickled ropes.” “It’s better now,” he added, “but it\r\ndon’t sell, and there’s no nourishment in such beef.”\r\n\r\nBut these tradesmen agreed in the information that poor labourers\r\nbought less meat, while one pronounced Free Trade a blessing, the other\r\ndeclared it a curse. I suggested to each that cheaper fish might have\r\nsomething to do with a smaller consumption of butcher’s meat, but both\r\nsaid that cheap fish was the great thing for the Irish and the poor\r\nneedle-women and the like, who were never at any time meat eaters.\r\n\r\nFrom respectable bakers I ascertained that bread might be considered\r\n1_d._ a quartern loaf dearer in 1845 than at present. Perhaps the\r\nfollowing table may throw a fuller light on the matter. I give it from\r\nwhat I learned from several men, who were without accounts to refer to,\r\nbut speaking positively from memory; I give the statement per week, as\r\nfor a single man, without charge for the support of a wife and family,\r\nand without any help from other resources.\r\n\r\n  ------------------+----------------------+----------------+------------\r\n                    |                      |                |   Saving\r\n                    |     Before Free      |   After Free   |    since\r\n                    |        Trade.        |     Trade.     |    Free\r\n                    |                      |                |   Trade.\r\n  ------------------+----------------------+----------------+------------\r\n  Rent              |     1_s._ 6_d._      |   1_s._ 6_d._  |     ...\r\n  Bread (5 loaves)  |     2_s._ 11_d._     |   2_s._ 6_d._  |    5_d._\r\n  Butter (1/2 lb.)  |         5_d._        |      5_d._     |     ...\r\n  Tea (2 oz.)       |         8_d._        |      8_d._     |     ...\r\n  Sugar (1/2 lb.)   |         3_d._        |      2_d._     |    1_d._\r\n  Meat (3 lb.)      |     1_s._ 6_d._      |   1_s._ 3_d._  |    3_d._\r\n  Bacon (1 lb.)     |         5_d._        |      5_d._     |     ...\r\n  Fish (a dinner    |3_d._, or 1_s._ 6_d._ |2_d._, or 1_s._ |\r\n    a day, 6 days)  |        weekly.       |    weekly.     |    6_d._\r\n  Potatoes or       |                      |                |\r\n    Vegetables      |                      |                |\r\n    (1/2_d._ a day) |       3-1/2_d._      |   3-1/2_d._    |     ...\r\n  Beer (pot)        |       3-1/2_d._      |   3-1/2_d._    |     ...\r\n  ------------------+----------------------+----------------+------------\r\n  Total saving, per week, since Free Trade                  | 1_s._ 3_d._\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------+------------\r\n\r\nIn butter, bacon, potatoes, &c., and beer, I could hear of no changes,\r\nexcept that bacon might be a trifle cheaper, but instead of a good\r\nquality selling better, although cheaper, there was a demand for an\r\ninferior sort.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing table the weekly consumption of several necessaries is\r\ngiven, but it is not to be understood that one man consumes them all in\r\na week; they are what may generally be consumed when such things are in\r\ndemand by the poor, one week after another, or one day after another,\r\nforming an aggregate of weeks.\r\n\r\nThus, Free Trade and cheap provisions are an unquestionable benefit, if\r\nunaffected by drawbacks, to the labouring poor.\r\n\r\nThe above statement refers only to a fully employed hand.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the change since Free Trade in the earnings\r\nof casual hands, and relates to the past and the present expenditure of\r\na scavager.

Numbers of large houses are now let out in single\r\nrooms, in the streets off Tottenham-court-road, and near Golden-square,\r\nas well as in many other quarters--to men, who, working for West-end\r\ntradesmen, must live, for economy of time, near the shops from which\r\nthey derive their work. Near and in Cunningham-street and other\r\nstreets, two men, father and son, rent upwards of 30 houses, the whole\r\nof which they let out in one or two rooms, it is believed at a very\r\ngreat profit; in fact they live by it.\r\n\r\nThe rent of these houses, among many others, was raised when the\r\nincome tax was imposed, the sub-lettors declaring, with what truth no\r\none knew, that the rents were raised to them. It is common enough for\r\ncapitalists to fling such imposts on the shoulders of the poor, and\r\nI heard scavagers complain, that every time they had to change their\r\nrooms, they had either to pay more rent by 2_d._ or 3_d._ a week, or\r\nput up with a worse place. One man who lived at the time of the passing\r\nof the Income Tax Bill in Shoe-lane, found his rent raised suddenly\r\n3_d._ a week, a non-resident landlord or agent calling for it weekly.\r\nHe was told that the advance was to meet the income tax. “I know\r\nnothing about what income tax means,” he said, “but it’s some ----\r\nroguery as is put on the poor.” I heard complaints to the same purport\r\nfrom several working scavagers, and the lettors of rooms are the most\r\nexacting in places crowded with the poor, and where the poor think or\r\nfeel they must reside “to be handy for work.” What connection there may\r\nbe between the questions of Free Trade and the necessity of the income\r\ntax, it is not my business now to dilate upon, but it is evident that\r\nthe circumstances of the country are not sufficiently prosperous to\r\nenable parliament to repeal this “temporary” impost.\r\n\r\nFrom a better informed class than the scavagers, I might have derived\r\ndata on which to form a calculation from account books, &c., but I\r\ncould hear of none being kept. I remember that a lady’s shoemaker told\r\nme that the weekly rents of the ten rooms in the house in which he\r\nlived were 4_s._ 3_d._ higher than before the income tax, which “came\r\nto the same thing as an extra penny on over 50 loaves a week.” It is\r\ncertain that the great tax-payers of London are the labouring classes.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to ascertain the facts in connection with this\r\ncomplex subject in as calm and just a manner as possible, leaning\r\nneither to the Protectionist nor the Free-Trade side of the question,\r\nand I must again in honesty acknowledge, that to the _constant_ hands\r\namong the scavagers and dustmen of the metropolis, the repeal of the\r\nCorn Laws appears to have been an unquestionable benefit.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this exposition of the condition and earnings of the\r\nworking scavagers employed by the more honourable masters, with an\r\naccount of the average income and expenditure of the better-paid hands\r\n(regular and casual, as well as single and married), and first, of the\r\nunmarried regular hand.\r\n\r\nThe following is an estimate of the income and expenditure of an\r\n_unmarried_ operative scavager _regularly_ employed, working for a\r\nlarge contractor:--\r\n\r\n             WEEKLY INCOME.           |          WEEKLY EXPENDITURE.\r\n                        £  _s._  _d._ |                         £  _s._  _d._\r\n  _Constant Wages._                   | Rent                    0    2    0\r\n  Nominal weekly wages  0   16     0  | Washing and mending     0    0   10\r\n  Perquisites           0    2     0  | Clothes, and repairing\r\n                        ------------  |  ditto                  0    0   10\r\n  Actual weekly wages   0   18     0  | Butcher’s meat          0    3    6\r\n                                      | Bacon                   0    0    8\r\n                                      | Vegetables              0    0    4\r\n                                      | Cheese                  0    0    4\r\n                                      | Beer                    0    3    0\r\n                                      | Spirits                 0    1    0\r\n                                      | Tobacco                 0    0   10-1/2\r\n                                      | Butter                  0    0    7-1/2\r\n                                      | Sugar                   0    0    4\r\n                                      | Tea                     0    0    3\r\n                                      | Coffee                  0    0    3\r\n                                      | Fish                    0    0    4\r\n                                      | Soap                    0    0    2\r\n                                      | Shaving                 0    0    1\r\n                                      | Fruit                   0    0    4\r\n                                      | Keep of 2 dogs          0    0    6\r\n                                      | Amusements, as\r\n                                      |  skittles, &c.          0    1    9\r\n                                      |                        -------------\r\n                                      |                         0   18    0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjoined represents the income of an _unmarried_ operative\r\nscavager _casually_ employed by a small master scavager six months\r\nduring the year, at 15_s._ a week, and 20 weeks at sand and rubbish\r\ncarting, at 12_s._ a week.\r\n\r\n    _Casual Wages._                                 £  _s._  _d._\r\n  Nominal weekly wages at scavaging, 16_s._ for\r\n    26 weeks during the year                       20   16    0\r\n  Perquisites, 2_s._ for 26 weeks during the year   2   12    0\r\n                                                   ----------------\r\n  Actual weekly wages for 26 weeks during the\r\n    year                                            0   16    0\r\n  Nominal and actual weekly wages at rubbish\r\n    carting, 12_s._ for 20 weeks more during the\r\n    year                                           12    0    0\r\n                                                   ----------------\r\n  Average casual or constant weekly wages\r\n    throughout the year                             0   15    4-1/2\r\n\r\nThe expenditure of this man when in work was nearly the same as that\r\nof the regular hand; the main exceptions being that his rent was 1_s._\r\ninstead of 2_s._, and no dogs were kept. When in work he saved nothing,\r\nand when out of work lived as he could.\r\n\r\nThe _married_ scavagers are differently circumstanced from the\r\n_unmarried_; their earnings are generally increased by those of their\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe labour of the wives and children of the scavagers is not\r\nunfrequently in the capacity of sifters in the dust-yards, where the\r\nwives of the men employed by the contractors have the preference, and\r\nin other but somewhat rude capacities. One of their wives I heard of\r\nas a dresser of sheep’s trotters; two as being among the most skilful\r\ndressers of tripe for a large shop; one as “a cat’s-meat seller” (her\r\nfather’s calling); but I still speak of the regular scavagers--I could\r\nnot meet with one woman “working a slop-needle.” One, indeed, I saw who\r\nwas described to me as a “feather dresser to an out-and-out negur,” but\r\nthe woman assured me she was neither badly paid nor badly off. Perhaps\r\nby such labour, as an average on the part of the wives, 9_d._ a day is\r\ncleared, and 1_s._ “on tripe and such like.” Among the “casual’s” wives\r\nthere are frequent instances of the working for slop shirt-makers, &c.,\r\nupon the coarser sorts of work, and at “starvation wages,” but on such\r\nmatters I have often dwelt. I heard from some of these men that it\r\nwas looked upon as a great thing if the wife’s labour could clear the\r\nweek’s rent of 1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._\r\n\r\nThe following may be taken as an estimate of the income and outlay of a\r\n_better paid and fully_ employed operative scavager, with his wife and\r\ntwo children:--\r\n\r\n     WEEKLY INCOME OF THE FAMILY.  | WEEKLY EXPENDITURE OF THE

 1   10     4\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE WORSE PAID SCAVAGERS, OR THOSE WORKING FOR SCURF[18] EMPLOYERS.\r\n\r\nThere are in the scavagers’ trade the same distinct classes of\r\nemployers as appertain to all other trades; these consist of:--\r\n\r\n  1. The large capitalists.\r\n  2. The small capitalists.\r\n\r\nAs a rule (with some few honourable and dishonourable exceptions,\r\nit is true) I find that the large capitalists in the several trades\r\nare generally the employers who pay the higher wages, and the small\r\nmen those who pay the lower. The reasons for this conduct are almost\r\nobvious. The power of the capital of the “large master” must be\r\ncontended against by the small one; and the usual mode of contention\r\nin all trades is by reducing the wages of the working men. The wealthy\r\nmaster has, of course, many advantages over the poor one. (1) He can\r\npay ready money, and obtain discounts for immediate payment. (2) He\r\ncan buy in large quantities, and so get his stock cheaper. (3) He can\r\npurchase what he wants in the best markets, and that _directly_ of the\r\nproducer, without the intervention and profit of the middleman. (4) He\r\ncan buy at the best times and seasons; and “lay in” what he requires\r\nfor the purposes of his trade long before it is needed, provided\r\nhe can obtain it “a bargain.” (5) He can avail himself of the best\r\ntools and mechanical contrivances for increasing the productiveness\r\nor “economizing the labour” of his workmen. (6) He can build and\r\narrange his places of work upon the most approved plan and in the best\r\nsituations for the manufacture and distribution of the commodities.\r\n(7) He can employ the highest talent for the management or design of\r\nthe work on which he is engaged. (8) He can institute a more effective\r\nsystem for the surveillance and checking of his workmen. (9) He can\r\nemploy a large number of hands, and so reduce the secondary expenses\r\n(of firing, lighting, &c.) attendant upon the work, as well as the\r\nnumber of superintendents and others engaged to “look after” the\r\noperatives. (10) He can resort to extensive means of making his trade\r\nknown. (11) He can sell cheaper (even if his cost of production be the\r\nsame), from employing a larger capital, and being able to “do with” a\r\nless rate of profit. (12) He can afford to give credit, and so obtain\r\ncustomers that he might otherwise lose.\r\n\r\nThe small capitalist, therefore, enters the field of competition by no\r\nmeans equally matched against his more wealthy rival. What the little\r\nmaster wants in “substance,” however, he generally endeavours to make\r\nup in cunning. If he cannot buy his materials as cheap as a trader of\r\nlarger means, he uses an inferior or cheaper article, and seeks by\r\nsome trick or other to palm it off as equal to the superior and dearer\r\nkind. If the tools and appliances of the trade are expensive, he either\r\ntransfers the cost of providing them to the workmen, or else he charges\r\nthem a rent for their use; and so with the places of work, he mulcts\r\ntheir wages of a certain sum per week for the gas by which they labour,\r\nor he makes them do their work at home, and thus saves the expense of\r\na workshop; and, lastly, he pays his men either a less sum than usual\r\nfor the same quantity of labour, or exacts a greater quantity from them\r\nfor the same sum of money. By one or other of these means does the man\r\nof limited capital seek to counterbalance the advantages which his more\r\nwealthy rival obtains by the possession of extensive “resources.” The\r\nlarge employer is enabled to work cheaper by the sheer force of his\r\nlarger capital. He reduces the cost of production, not by employing a\r\ncheaper labour, but by “economizing the labour” that he does employ.\r\nThe small employer, on the other hand, seeks to keep pace with his\r\nlarger rival, and strives to work cheap, not by “the economy of labour”\r\n(for this is hardly possible in the small way of production), but by\r\nreducing the wages of his labourers. Hence the _rule_ in almost every\r\ntrade is that the smaller capitalists pay a lower rate of wages. To\r\nthis, however, there are many honourable exceptions among the small\r\nmasters, and many as dishonourable among the larger ones in different\r\ntrades. Messrs. Moses, Nicoll, and Hyams, for instance, are men who\r\ncertainly cannot plead deficiency of means as an excuse for reducing\r\nthe ordinary rate of wages among the tailors.\r\n\r\nThose employers who seek to reduce the prices of a trade are known\r\ntechnologically as “_cutting employers_,” in contradistinction to the\r\nstandard employers, or those who pay their workpeople and sell their\r\ngoods at the ordinary rates.\r\n\r\nOf “cutting employers” there are several kinds, differently designated,\r\naccording to the different means by which they gain their ends. These\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n1. “_Drivers_,” or those who compel the men in their employ to do\r\nmore work for the same wages; of this kind there are two distinct\r\nvarieties:--\r\n\r\n _a._ _The long-hour masters_, or those who make the men work longer\r\n than the usual hours of labour.\r\n\r\n _b._ _The strapping masters_, or those who make the men (by extra\r\n supervision) “strap” to their work, so as to do a greater quantity of\r\n labour in the usual time.\r\n\r\n2. _Grinders_, or those who compel the workmen (through their\r\nnecessities) to do the same amount of work for less than the ordinary\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of wages thus brought about may or may not be attended\r\nwith a corresponding reduction in the price of the goods to the public;\r\nif the price of the goods be reduced in proportion to the reduction\r\nof wages, the consumer, of course, is benefited at the expense of\r\nthe producer. When it is not followed by a like diminution in the\r\nselling price of the article, and the wages of which the men are mulct\r\ngo to increase the profits of the capitalist, the employer alone is\r\nbenefited, and is then known as a “_grasper_.”\r\n\r\nSome cutting tradesmen, however, endeavour to undersell their more\r\nwealthy rivals, by reducing the ordinary rate of profit, and extending\r\ntheir business on the principle of small profits and quick returns,\r\nthe “nimble ninepence” being considered “better than the slow\r\nshilling.” Such traders, of course, cannot be said to reduce wages\r\ndirectly--indirectly, however, they have the same effect, for in\r\nreducing prices, other traders, ever ready to compete with them, but,\r\nunwilling, or perhaps unable, to accept less than the ordinary rate of\r\nprofit, seek to attain the same cheapness by diminishing the cost of\r\nproduction, and for this end the labourers’ wages are almost invariably\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nSuch are the characteristics of the cheap employers in all trades. Let\r\nme now proceed to point out the peculiarities of what are called the\r\nscurf employers in the scavaging trade.\r\n\r\nThe insidious practices of capitalists in other callings, in reducing\r\nthe hire of labour, are not unknown to the scavagers. The evils of\r\nwhich these workmen have to complain under scurf or slop masters are:--\r\n\r\n1. _Driving_, or being compelled to do more work for the _same pay_.\r\n\r\n2. _Grinding_, or being compelled to do the same or a greater amount of\r\nwork for _less pay_.\r\n\r\n1. Under the first head, if the employment be at all regular, I heard\r\nfew complaints, for the men seemed to have learned to look upon it as\r\nan inevitable thing, that one way or other they _must_ submit, by the\r\nreceipt of a reduced wage, or the exercise of a greater toil, to a\r\ndeterioration in their means.\r\n\r\nThe system of driving, or, in other words, the means by which extra\r\nwork is got out of the men for the same remuneration, in the scavagers’\r\ntrade is as follows:--some employers cause their scavagers after their\r\nday’s work in the streets, to load the barges with the street and\r\nhouse-collected manure, without any additional payment; whereas, among\r\nthe more liberal employers, there are bargemen who are employed to\r\nattend to this department of the trade, and if their street scavagers\r\n_are_ so employed, which is not very often, it is computed as extra\r\nwork or “over hours,” and paid for accordingly. This same indirect mode\r\nof reducing wages (by getting more work done for the same pay) is seen\r\nin many piece-work callings. The slop boot and shoe makers pay the same\r\nprice as they did six or seven years ago, but they have “knocked off\r\nthe extras,” as the additional allowance for greater than the ordinary\r\nheight of heel, and the like. So the slop Mayor of Manchester, Sir\r\nElkanah Armitage, within the last year or two, sought to obtain from\r\nhis men a greater length of “cut” to each piece of woven for the same\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nSome master scavagers or contractors, moreover, reduce wages by making\r\ntheir men do what is considered the work of “a man and a half” in a\r\nweek, without the recompense due for the labour of the “half” man’s\r\nwork; in other words, they require the men to condense eight or nine\r\ndays’ labour into six, and to be paid for the six days only; this again\r\nis usual in the strapping shops of the carpenters’ trade.\r\n\r\nThus the class of street-sweepers do not differ materially in the\r\ncircumstances of their position from other bodies of workers skilled\r\nand unskilled.\r\n\r\nLet me, however, give a practical illustration of the loss accruing to\r\nthe working scavagers by the _driving_ method of reducing wages.\r\n\r\nA is a large contractor and a driver. He employs 16 men, and pays them\r\nthe “regular wages” of the honourable trade; but, instead of limiting\r\nthe hours of labour to 12, as is usual among the better class of\r\nemployers, he compels each of his men to work at the least 16 hours per\r\ndiem, which is one-third more, and for which the men should receive\r\none-third more wages. Let us see, therefore, how much the men in his\r\nemploy lose annually by these means.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------+--------------+-----------+-----------\r\n                             | Sum received |  Sum they |\r\n                             |     per      |   should  |\r\n                             |    Annum.    |  receive. |Difference.\r\n  ---------------------------+--------------+-----------+-----------\r\n  4 Gangers, at 18_s._ a }   |    £   _s._  |  £   _s._ |  £   _s._\r\n    week, for 9 months   }   |   140    8   | 210   12  |  70    4\r\n    in the year          }   |              |           |\r\n  12 Sweepers, at 16_s._ a } |              |           |\r\n    week, for 9 months     } |   374    8   | 499    4  | 124   16\r\n    in the year            } |              |           |\r\n  ---------------------------+--------------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Total wages per Ann.       |   514   16   | 709   16  | 195   0\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find the annual loss to these men through the system of\r\n“driving” to be 195_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nBut A is not the only driver in the scavagers’ trade; out of the 19\r\nmasters having contracts for scavaging, as cited in the table given at\r\npp. 213, 214, there are 4 who are regular drivers; and, making the same\r\ncalculation as above, we have the following results:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------\r\n                           |Sum received | Sum they  |\r\n                           |    per      |  should   |Difference.\r\n                           |   Annum.    | receive.  |\r\n  -------------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------\r\n  26 Gangers, at 18_s._ a }|    £   _s._ |   £   _s._|   £   _s._\r\n    week, for 9 months    }|   912   12  | 1216   16 |  304   4\r\n    in the year           }|             |           |\r\n  80 Sweepers, at 16_s._ a}|             |           |\r\n    week, for 9 months    }|  2496    0  | 3328    0 |  832   0\r\n    in the year           }|             |           |\r\n  -------------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------\r\n                           |  3308   12  | 4544   16 | 1136   4\r\n  -------------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nThus we find that the gross sum of which the men employed by these\r\ndrivers are deprived, is no less than 1136_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\n2. The second or indirect mode of reducing the wages of the men in the\r\nscavaging trade is by _Grinding_; that is to say, by making the men\r\ndo the same amount of work for less pay. It requires nothing but a\r\npractical illustration to render the injury of this particular mode of\r\nreduction apparent to the public.\r\n\r\nB is a master scavager (a small contractor, though the instances are\r\nnot confined to this class), and a “_Grinder_.” He pays 1_s._ a week\r\nless than the “regular wages” of the honourable trade. He employs six\r\nmen; hence the amount that the workmen in his pay are mulct of every\r\nyear is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------\r\n                           |Sum received | Sum they  |\r\n                           |    per      |  should   |Difference.\r\n                           |   Annum.    | receive.  |\r\n  -------------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------\r\n  6 men, at 15_s._ a week,}|   £   _s._  |  £   _s._ |  £   _s._\r\n    for 9 months in the   }|  175   10   | 187    4  |  11   14\r\n    year                  }|             |           |\r\n  -------------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nHere the loss to the men is 11_l._ 14_s._ per annum, and there is but\r\none such grinder among the 19 master scavagers who have contracts at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n3. The third and last method of reducing the earnings of the men as\r\nabove enumerated, is by a combination of both the systems before\r\nexplained, viz., by _grinding_ and _driving_ united, that is to say,\r\nby not only paying the men a smaller wage than the more honourable\r\nmasters, but by compelling them to work longer hours as well. Let me\r\ncite another illustration from the trade.\r\n\r\nC is a large contractor, and both a grinder and driver. He employs\r\n28 men, and not only pays them less wages, but makes them work\r\nlonger hours than the better class of employers. The men in his pay,\r\ntherefore, are annually mulct of the following sums.\r\n\r\n         SUMS THE MEN RECEIVE.        |     SUMS THEY SHOULD RECEIVE.\r\n                        £   _s._  _d._|                       £   _s._  _d._\r\n                                      |\r\n  7 Gangers, at 16_s._                | 7 Gangers, at 18_s._\r\n    a week, for 9                     |   a week, for 9\r\n    months in the                     |   months in the\r\n    year               218    8    0  |   year               245   14    0\r\n  21 Sweepers, at                     | Over work, 4\r\n    15_s._ a week      614    5    0  |    hours per day      61    8    6\r\n                       -------------  | 21 Sweepers, at\r\n                       832   13    0  |   16_s._ a week, 12\r\n                                      |   hours a day        655    4    0\r\n                                      | Over work, 4\r\n                                      |   hours a day        163    6    0\r\n                                      |                     --------------\r\n                                      |                     1125   12    6\r\n\r\nHere the annual loss to the men employed by this one master is 292_l._\r\n19_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nAmong the 19 master scavagers there are altogether 7 employers who\r\nare both grinders and drivers. These employ among them no less than\r\n111 hands; hence, the gross amount of which their workmen are yearly\r\ndefrau--no, let me adhere to the principles of political economy, and\r\nsay deprived--is as under:--\r\n\r\n     SUM THE MEN ANNUALLY RECEIVE.    |    SUM THEY SHOULD ANNUALLY RECEIVE.\r\n                        £   _s._  _d._|                     £   _s._  _d._\r\n  28 Gangers, at 16_s._               | 28 Gangers, at\r\n    a week, employed                  |   18_s._ a week\r\n    for 9 months                      |   (12 hours a\r\n    in the year        873   12    0  |   day), for 9\r\n                                      |   months in the\r\n  83 Sweepers, at                     |   year             982   16    0\r\n    15_s._ a week,                    | Over work, 4\r\n    employed for                      |   hours per day    245   14    0\r\n    9 months in                       | 83 Sweepers, at\r\n    the year          2427   15    0  |   16_s._ a week,\r\n                      --------------  |   12 hours a day  2589   12    0\r\n                      3301    7    0  | Over work, 4\r\n                                      |   hours per day    647    8    0\r\n                                      |                   --------------\r\n                                      |                   4465   10    0\r\n\r\nHere we perceive the gross loss to the operatives from the system of\r\ncombined grinding and driving to be no less than 1164_l._ 3_s._ per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what is the aggregate loss to the working men from the\r\nseveral modes of reducing their wages as above detailed.\r\n\r\n                                                                £.  _s._  _d._\r\n  Loss to the working scavagers by the “driving” of employers 1136   4     0\r\n  Ditto by the “grinding”                                       11  14     0\r\n  Ditto by the “grinding _and_ driving” of employers          1164   3     0\r\n                                                              --------------\r\n  Total loss to the working scavagers per annum               2312   1     0\r\n\r\nNow this is a large sum of money to be wrested annually out of the\r\nworkmen--that it is so wrested is demonstrated by the fact cited at p.\r\n174 in connection with the dust trade.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the dustmen employed by the large contractors, it is there\r\nstated, have been increased within the last seven years from 6_d._ to\r\n8_d._ per load. This increase in the rate of remuneration was owing to\r\ncomplaints made by the men to the Commissioners of Sewers, that they\r\nwere not able to live on their earnings; an inquiry took place, and the\r\nresult was that the Commissioners decided upon letting the contracts\r\nonly to such parties as would undertake to pay a fair price to their\r\nworkmen. The contractors accordingly increased the remuneration of the\r\nlabourers as mentioned.\r\n\r\nNow political economy would tell us that the Commissioners _interfered_\r\nwith wages in a most reprehensible manner--preventing the natural\r\noperation of the law of Supply and Demand; but both justice and\r\nbenevolence assure us that the Commissioners did perfectly right. The\r\nmasters in the dust trade were forced to make good to the men what they\r\nhad previously taken from them, and the same should be done in the\r\nscavaging trade--the contracts should be let only to these masters who\r\nwill undertake to pay the regular rate of wages, and employ their men\r\nonly the regular hours; for by such means, and by such means alone, can\r\n_justice_ be done to the operatives.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the _cause of the reduction of wages in the scavaging\r\ntrade_. The scurf trade, I am informed, has been carried on among\r\nthe master scavagers upwards of 20 years, and arose partly from the\r\ncontractors having _to pay_ the parishes for the house-dust and\r\nstreet-sweepings, brieze and street manure at that period often selling\r\nfor 30_s._ the chaldron or load. The demand for this kind of manure\r\n20 years ago was so great, that there was a competition carried on\r\namong the contractors themselves, each out-bidding the other, so as to\r\nobtain the right of collecting it; and in order not to lose anything\r\nby the large sums which they were induced to bid for the contracts,\r\nthe employers began gradually to “grind down” their men from 17_s._\r\n6_d._ (the sum paid 20 years back) to 17_s._ a week, and eventually\r\nto 15_s._, and even 12_s._ weekly. This is a curious and instructive\r\nfact, as showing that even an increase of prices will, _under the\r\ncontract system_, induce a reduction of wages. The greed of traders\r\nbecomes, it appears, from the very height of the prices, proportionally\r\nintensified, and from the desire of each to reap the benefit, they are\r\nled to outbid one another to such an extent, and to offer such large\r\npremiums for the right of appropriation, as to necessitate a reduction\r\nof every possible expense in order to make any profit at all upon the\r\ntransaction. Owing, moreover, to the surplus labour in the trade, the\r\ncontractors were enabled to offer any premiums and reduce wages as they\r\npleased; for the casually-employed men, when the wet season was over,\r\nand their services no longer required, were continually calling upon\r\nthe contractors, and offering their services at 2_s._ and 3_s._ less\r\nper week than the regular hands were receiving. The consequence was,\r\nthat five or six of the master scavagers began to reduce the wages of\r\ntheir labourers, and since that time the number has been gradually\r\nincreasing, until now there are no less than 21 scurf masters (8 of\r\nwhom have no contracts) out of the 34 contractors; so that nearly\r\nthree-fifths of the entire trade belong to the _grinding_ class. Within\r\nthe last seven or eight years, however, there has been an increase of\r\nwages in connection with the city operative scavagers. This was owing\r\nmainly to the operatives complaining to the Commissioners that they\r\ncould not live upon the wages they were then receiving--12_s._ and\r\n14_s._ a week. The circumstances inducing the change, I am informed,\r\nwere as follows:--one of the gangers asked a tradesman in the city to\r\ngive the street-sweepers “something for beer,” whereupon the tradesman\r\ninquired if the men could not find beer out of their wages, and on\r\nbeing assured that they were receiving only 12_s._ a week, he had the\r\nmatter brought before the Board. The result was, that the wages of the\r\noperatives were increased from 12_s._ to 15_s._ and 16_s._ weekly,\r\nsince which time there has been neither an increase nor a decrease\r\nin their pay. The cheapness of provisions seems to have caused no\r\nreduction with them.\r\n\r\nNow there are but two “efficient causes” to account for the reduction\r\nof wages among the scurf employers in the scavagers’ trade:--(1) The\r\nemployers may diminish the pay of their men from a disposition to\r\n“_grind_” out of them an inordinate rate of profit. (2) The price paid\r\nfor the work may be so reduced that, consistent with the ordinary rate\r\nof profit on capital, and remuneration for superintendence, greater\r\nwages cannot be paid. If the first be the fact, then the employers\r\nare to blame, and the parishes should follow the example of the\r\nCommissioners of Sewers, and let the work to those contractors only who\r\nwill undertake to pay the “regular wages” of the honourable trade; but\r\nif the latter be the case, as I strongly suspect it is, though some\r\nof the masters seem to be more “grasping” than the rest--but in the\r\npaucity of returns on this matter, it is difficult to state positively\r\nwhether the price paid for the labour of the working scavager is in all\r\nthe parishes proportional to the price paid to the employers for the\r\nwork (a most important fact to be solved)--if, however, I repeat, the\r\ndecrease of the wages be mainly due to the decrease in the sums given\r\nfor the performance of the contract, then the parishes are to blame for\r\nseeking to get their work done _at the expense of the working men_.\r\n\r\nThe contract system of work, I find, necessarily tends to this\r\ndiminution of the men’s earnings in a trade. Offer a certain quantity\r\nof work to the lowest bidder, and the competition will assuredly be\r\nmaintained at _the operative’s expense_. It is idle to expect that,\r\nas a general rule, traders will take less than the ordinary rate of\r\nprofit. Hence, he who underbids will usually be found to underpay.\r\nThis, indeed, is almost a necessity of the system, and one which\r\nthe parochial functionaries more than all others should be guarded\r\nagainst--seeing that a decrease of the operative’s wages can but be\r\nattended with an increase of the very paupers, and consequently of the\r\nparochial expenses, which they are striving to reduce.\r\n\r\nA labourer, in order to be self-supporting and avoid becoming\r\na “burden” on the parish, requires something more than bare\r\nsubsistence-money in remuneration for his labour, and yet this is\r\ngenerally the mode by which we test the _sufficiency of wages_. “A man\r\ncan live very comfortably upon that!” is the exclamation of those who\r\nhave seldom thought upon what constitutes the _minimum_ of self-support\r\nin this country. A man’s wages, to prevent pauperism, should include,\r\nbesides present subsistence, what Dr. Chalmers has called “his\r\nsecondaries;” viz., a sufficiency to pay for his maintenance: 1st,\r\nduring the slack season; 2nd, when out of employment; 3rd, when ill;\r\n4th, when old[19]. If insufficient to do this, it is evident that\r\nthe man at such times must seek parochial relief; and it is by the\r\nreduction of wages down to bare subsistence, that the cheap employers\r\nof the present day shift the burden of supporting their labourers when\r\nunemployed on to the parish; thus virtually perpetuating the allowance\r\nsystem or relief in aid of wages under the old Poor Law. Formerly the\r\nmode of hiring labourers was by the year, so that the employer was\r\nbound to maintain the men when unemployed. But now journey-work, or\r\nhiring by the day, prevails, and the labourers being paid--and that\r\nmere subsistence-money--only when wanted, are necessitated to become\r\neither paupers or thieves when their services are no longer required.\r\nIt is, moreover, this change from yearly to daily hirings, and the\r\nconsequent discarding of men when no longer required, that has partly\r\ncaused the immense mass of surplus labourers, who are continually\r\nvagabondizing through the country begging or stealing as they go--men\r\nfor whom there is but some two or three weeks’ work (harvesting,\r\nhop-picking, and the like) throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThat there is, however, a large system of _jobbing pursued by the\r\ncontractors_ for the house-dust and cleansing of the streets, there\r\ncannot be the least doubt. The minute I have cited at page 210 gives\r\nus a slight insight into the system of combination existing among the\r\nemployers, and the extraordinary fluctuations in the prices obtained by\r\nthe contractors would lead to the notion that the business was more a\r\nsystem of gambling than trade. The following returns have been procured\r\nby Mr. Cochrane within the last few days:--\r\n\r\n  “Average yearly cost of cleansing\r\n  the whole of the public ways within\r\n  the City of London, including the removal\r\n  of dust, ashes, &c., from the\r\n  houses of the inhabitants, for eight\r\n  years, terminating at Michaelmas in\r\n  the year 1850                               £4,643\r\n\r\n  Square yards of carriage-way, estimated\r\n  at                                         430,000\r\n\r\n  Square yards of footway, estimated\r\n  at                                         300,000\r\n\r\nA more specific and later return is as follows:--\r\n\r\n            Received         Paid for\r\n            for Dust.     cleansing, &c.\r\n           £   _s._  _d._     £   _s._  _d._ { Streets not\r\n  1845     0    0     0    2833    2     0   { cleansed\r\n                                             {  daily.\r\n  1846  1354    5     0    6034    6     0   }\r\n  1847  4455    5     0    8014    2     0   } Streets\r\n  1848  1328   15     0    7226    1     6   } cleansed\r\n  1849     0    0     0    7486   11     6   } daily.\r\n  1850     0    0     0    6779   16     0   }\r\n\r\n“From the above return,” says Mr. Cochrane, “it may be _inferred_ that\r\nthe annual sums paid for cleansing in each year of 1844 and 1843 did\r\nnot exceed 2281_l._, as this would make up the eight years’ average\r\ncalculation of 4643_l._”\r\n\r\nSince the streets have been cleansed daily, it will be seen that the\r\naverage has been 7188_l._ The smallest amount, in 1846, was 6034_l._;\r\nand the largest, in 1847, 8014_l._; which was a sudden increase of\r\n1980_l._\r\n\r\nHere, then, we perceive an immediate increase in the price paid for\r\nscavaging between 1846 and 1847 of nearly 33 per cent., and since the\r\nwages of the workmen were not proportionately increased in the latter\r\nyear by the employers, it follows that the profits of the contractors\r\nmust have been augmented to that enormous extent. The only effectual\r\nmode of preventing this system of jobbing being persevered in, _at\r\nthe expense of the workmen_, is by the insertion of a clause in each\r\nparish contract similar to that introduced by the Commissioners of\r\nSewers--that at least a fair living rate of wages shall be paid by each\r\ncontractor to the men employed by him. This may be an interference with\r\nthe freedom of labour, according to the economists’ “cant” language,\r\nbut at least it is a restriction of the tyranny of capital, for free\r\nlabour means, when literally translated, _the unrestricted use of\r\ncapital_, which is (especially when the moral standard of trade is not\r\nof the highest character) perhaps the greatest evil with which a State\r\ncan be afflicted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet me now speak of the _Scurf labourers_. The moral and social\r\ncharacteristics of the working scavagers who labour for a lower rate of\r\nhire do not materially differ from those of the better paid and more\r\nregularly employed body, unless, perhaps, in this respect, that there\r\nare among them a greater proportion of the “casuals,” or of men reared\r\nto the pursuit of other callings, and driven by want, misfortune, or\r\nmisconduct, to “sweep the streets;” and not only that, but to regard\r\nthe “leave to toil” in such a capacity a boon. These constitute, as it\r\nwere, the cheap labourers of this trade.\r\n\r\nAmong the parties concerned in the lower-priced scavaging, are the\r\nusual criminations. The parish authorities will not put up any longer\r\nwith the extortions of the contractors. The contractors cannot put\r\nup any longer with the stinginess of the parishes. The _working_\r\nscavagers, upon whose shoulders the burthen falls the heaviest--as\r\nit does in all depreciated tradings--grumble at both. I cannot aver,\r\nhowever, that I found among the men that bitter hatred of their masters\r\nwhich I found actuating the mass of operative tailors, shoemakers,\r\ndressmakers, &c., toward the slop capitalists who employed them.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out in what the “scurf” treatment of the labourers was\r\nchiefly manifested--in extra work for inferior pay; in doing eight or\r\nnine days’ work in six; and in being paid for only six days’ labour,\r\nand not always at the ordinary rate even for the lighter toil--not\r\n2_s._ 8_d._, but 2_s._ 6_d._ or even 2_s._ 4_d._ a day. To the wealthy,\r\nthis 2_d._ or 4_d._ a day may seem but a trifling matter, but I heard a\r\nworking scavager (formerly a house-painter) put it in a strong light:\r\n“that 3_d._ or 4_d._ a day, sir, is a poor family’s rent.” The rent, I\r\nmay observe, as a result of my inquiries among the more decent classes\r\nof labourers, is often the primary consideration: “You see, sir, we\r\nmust have a roof over our heads.”\r\n\r\nA scavager, working for a scurf master, gave me the following account.\r\nHe was a middle-aged man, decently dressed, for when I saw him, he was\r\nin his “Sunday clothes,” and was quiet in his tones, even when he spoke\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n“My father,” he said, “was once in business as a butcher, but he\r\nfailed, and was afterwards a journeyman butcher, but very much\r\nrespected, I know, and I used to job and help him. O dear, yes! I can\r\nread and write, but I have very seldom to write, only I think one\r\nnever forgets it, it’s like learning to swim, that way; and I read\r\nsometimes at coffee-shops. My father died rather sudden, and me and a\r\nbrother had to look out. My brother was older than me, he was 20 or\r\n21 then, and he went for a soldier, I believe to some of the Ingees,\r\nbut I’ve never heard of him since. I got a place in a knacker’s yard,\r\nbut I didn’t like it at all, _it was so confining_, and should have\r\nhooked it, only I left it honourable. I can’t call to mind how long\r\nthat’s back, perhaps 16 or 18 years, but I know there was some stir\r\nat the time about having the streets and yards cleaner. A man called\r\nand had some talk with the governor, and says he, says the governor,\r\nsays he, ‘if you want a handy lad with his besom, and he’s good for\r\nnothing else’--but that was his gammon--‘here’s your man;’ so I was\r\nengaged as a young sweeper at 10_s._ a week. I worked in Hackney, but I\r\nheard so much about railways, that I saved my money up to 10_s._, and\r\npopped [pledged] a suit of mourning I’d got after my father’s death for\r\n22_s._, and got to York, both on foot and with lifts. I soon got work\r\non a rail; there was great call for rails then, but I don’t know how\r\nlong it’s since, and I was a navvy for six or seven years, or better.\r\nThen I came back to London. I don’t know just what made me come back,\r\n_but I was restless_, and I thought I could get work as easy in London\r\nas in the country, but I couldn’t. I brought 21 gold sovereigns with\r\nme to London, twisted in my fob for safeness, in a wash-leather bag.\r\nThey didn’t last so long as they ought to. I didn’t care for drinking,\r\nonly when I was in company, but I was a little too gay. One night I\r\nspent over 12_s._ in the St. Helena Gardens at Rotherhithe, and that\r\nsort of thing soon makes money show taper. I got some work with a\r\nrubbish carter, a regular scurf. I made only about 8_s._ a week under\r\nhim, for he didn’t want me this half day or that whole day, and if I\r\nsaid anything, he told me I might go and be d----d, he could get plenty\r\nsuch, and I knew he could. I got on then with a gangsman I knew, at\r\nstreet-sweeping. I had 15_s._ a week, but not regular work, but when\r\nthe work wer’n’t regular, I had 2_s._ 8_d._ a day. I then worked under\r\nanother master for 14_s._ a week, and was often abused that I wasn’t\r\nbetter dressed, for though that there master paid low wages, he was\r\nvexed if his men didn’t look decent in the streets. I’ve heard that\r\nhe said he paid the best of wages when asked about it. I had another\r\njob after that, at 15_s._, and then 16_s._ a week, with a contractor\r\nas had a wharf; but a black nigger slave was never slaved as I was.\r\nI’ve worked all night, when it’s been very moonlight, in loading a\r\nbarge, and I’ve worked until three and four in the morning that way,\r\nand then me and another man slept an hour or two in a shed as joined\r\nhis stables, and then must go at it again. Some of these masters is\r\nignorant, and treats men like dirt, but this one was always civil, and\r\nmade his people be civil. But, Lord, I hadn’t a rag left to my back.\r\nEverything was worn to bits in such hard work, and then I got the sack.\r\nI was on for Mr. ---- next. He’s a jolly good ’un. I was only on for\r\nhim temp’ry, but I was told it was for temp’ry when I went, so I can’t\r\ncomplain. I’m out of work this week, but I’ve had some jobs from a\r\nbutcher, and I’m going to work again on Monday. I don’t know at what\r\nwages. The gangsmen said they’d see what I could do. It’ll be 15_s._, I\r\nexpect, and over-work if it’s 16_s._\r\n\r\n“Yes, I like a pint of beer now and then, and one requires it, but I\r\ndon’t get drunk. I dusted for a fortnight once while a man was ill, and\r\ngot more beer and twopences give me than I do in a year now; aye, twice\r\nas much. My mate and me was always very civil, and people has said,\r\n‘there’s a good fellow, just sweep together this bit of rubbish in the\r\nyard here, and off with it.’ That was beyond our duty, but we did it. I\r\nhave very little night-work, only for one master; he’s a sweep as well.\r\nI get 2_s._ 6_d._ a job for it. Yes, there’s mostly something to drink,\r\nbut you can’t demand nothing. Night-work’s nothing, sir; no more ain’t\r\na knacker’s yard.\r\n\r\n“I pay 2_s._ a week rent, but I’m washed for and found soap as well.\r\nMy landlady takes in washing, and when her husband, for they’re an old\r\ncouple, has the rheumatics, I make a trifle by carrying out the clothes\r\non a barrow, and Mrs. Smith goes with them and sees to the delivery.\r\nI’ve my own furniture.\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know what I spend in my living in a week. I have a bit\r\nof meat, or a saveloy or two, or a slice of bacon every day, mostly\r\nwhen I’m at work. I sometimes make my own meals ready in my room. No,\r\nI keep no accounts. There’d be very little use or pleasure in doing it\r\nwhen one has so little to count. When I’m past work, I suppose I must\r\ngo to the workhouse. I sometimes wish I’d gone for a soldier when I was\r\nyoung enough. I shouldn’t have minded going abroad. I’d have liked it\r\nbetter than not, for _I like to be about; yes, I like a change_.\r\n\r\n“I go to chapel every Sunday night, and have regularly since Mr. ----\r\n(the butcher) gave me this cast-off suit. I promised him I would when I\r\ngot the togs.\r\n\r\n“Things would be well enough with me if I’d constant work and fair\r\npay. I don’t know what makes wages so low. I suppose it’s rich people\r\ntrying to get all the money they can, and caring nothing for poor men’s\r\nrights, and poor men’s sometimes forced to undersell one another,\r\n’cause half a loaf you know, sir, is better than no bread at all” (a\r\nproverb, by the way, which has wrought no little mischief).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may remark, that although I was told, in the first\r\ninstance, there was sub-letting in street sweeping, I could not hear\r\nof any facts to prove it. I was told, indeed, by a gentleman who took\r\ngreat interest in parochial matters, with a view to “reforms” in them,\r\nthat such a thing was most improbable, for if a contractor sub-let any\r\nof his work it would soon become known, and as it would be evident that\r\nthe work could be accomplished at a lower rate, the contractor would be\r\nin a worse position for his next contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-SWEEPING MACHINE, AND THE STREET-SWEEPERS EMPLOYED WITH\r\nIT.\r\n\r\nUntil the introduction of the machines now seen in London, I believe\r\nthat no mechanical contrivances for sweeping the streets had been\r\nattempted, all such work being executed by manual labour, and employing\r\nthroughout the United Kingdom a great number of the poor. The\r\nstreet-sweeping machine, therefore, assumes an importance as another\r\ninstance of the displacement, or attempted displacement, of the labour\r\nof man by the mechanism of an engine.\r\n\r\nThe street-sweeping machines were introduced into London about five\r\nyears ago, after having been previously used, under the management\r\nof a company, in Manchester, the inventor and maker being Mr.\r\nWhitworth, of that place. The novelty and ingenuity of the apparatus\r\nsoon attracted public attention, and for the first week or two the\r\nvehicular street-sweeper was accompanied in its progress by a crowd\r\nof admiring and inquisitive pedestrians, so easily attracted together\r\nin the metropolis. In the first instance the machines were driven\r\nthrough the streets merely to display their mode and power of work,\r\nand the drivers and attendants not unfrequently came into contact\r\nwith the regular scavagers, when a brisk interchange of street wit\r\ntook place, the populace often enough encouraging both sides. At\r\npresent the street-sweeping machine proceeds on its line of operation\r\nas little noticed, except by visitors, and foreigners especially, as\r\nany other vehicle. The body of the sweeping machine, although the\r\nsizes may not all be uniform, is about 5 feet in length, and 2 feet\r\n8 inches or 3 feet in width; the height is about 5 feet 6 inches or\r\n6 feet, and the form that of a covered cart, with a rounded top. The\r\nsides of the exterior are of cast iron, the top being of wood. At the\r\nhinder part of the cart is fixed the sweeping-machine itself, covered\r\nby sloping boards which descend from the top of the cart, projecting\r\nslightly behind the vehicle to the ground; under the sloping boards is\r\nan endless chain of brushes as wide as the cart, 16 in number, placed\r\nat equal distances, and so arranged, that when made to revolve, each\r\nbrush in turn passes over the ground, sweeping the mud along with it\r\nto the bottom sloping board, and so carrying it up to the interior of\r\nthe cart. The chain of brushes is set in motion, over the surface of\r\nthe pavement, by the agency of three cog wheels of cast iron; these are\r\nworked by the rotation of the wheels of the cart, the cogs acting upon\r\nthe spindles to which the brooms are attached. The spindles, brushes,\r\nand the sloped boards can be raised or lowered by the winding of an\r\ninstrument called the broom winder; or the whole can be locked. The\r\nbrooms are raised when any acclivity is to be swept, and lowered at\r\na declivity. The vehicle must be water-tight, in order to contain the\r\nslop.\r\n\r\nWhen full the machine holds about half a cart load or half a ton of\r\ndirt; this is emptied by letting down the back in the manner of a trap\r\ndoor. If the contents be solid, they have to be forked out; if more\r\nsloppy, they are “shot” out, as from a cart, the interior generally\r\nbeing roughly scraped to complete the emptying.\r\n\r\nThe districts which have as yet been cleansed by the machines are what\r\nmay be considered a government domain, being the public thoroughfares\r\nunder the control of the Commissioners of the Woods and Forests,\r\nrunning from Westminster Abbey to the Regent-circus in Piccadilly,\r\nand including Spring-gardens, Carlton-gardens, and a portion of the\r\nWest Strand, where they were first employed in London; they have been\r\nused also in parts of the City; and are at present employed by the\r\nparish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The company by whom the mechanical\r\nstreet-sweeping business is carried on employ 12 machines, 4 water\r\ncarts, 19 horses, and 24 men. They have also the use, but not the sole\r\nuse, of two wharfs and barges at Whitefriars and Millbank. The machines\r\naltogether collect about 30 cart-loads of street-dirt a day, which is\r\nequivalent to four or five barge-loads in a week, if all were boated.\r\nTwo barges per week are usually sent to Rochester, the others up the\r\nriver to Fulham, &c. The average price is 5_l._ 10_s._ to 6_l._ per\r\nbarge load, but when the freight has been chiefly dung, as much as\r\n8_l._ has been paid for it by a farmer.\r\n\r\nThe street-sweeping machine seems to have commanded the approbation\r\nof the General Board of Health, although the Board’s expression of\r\napproval is not without qualification. “Even that efficient and\r\neconomical implement,” says one of the Reports, “the street-sweeping\r\nmachine, leaves much filth between the interstices of the stones\r\nand some on the surface.” One might have imagined, however, that an\r\nefficient and economical implement would not have left this “much\r\nfilth” in its course; but the Board, I presume, spoke comparatively.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the circumscribed adoption of the machine--I say it with\r\nsome reluctance, but from concurrent testimony--appears to be that it\r\ndoes _not_ sweep sufficiently clean. It sweeps the surface, but only\r\nthe surface; not cleansing what the scavagers call the “nicks” and\r\n“holes,” and the Board of Health the “interstices,” in the pavement.\r\n\r\nOne man is obliged to go along with each machine, to sweep the ridge\r\nof dirt invariably left at the edge of the track of the vehicle into\r\nthe line of the next machine, so that it may be “licked up.” In fine\r\nweather this work is often light enough. It is also the occupation\r\nof the accompanying scavager to sweep the dirt from the sloping\r\nedges of the public ways into the direct course of the machine, for\r\nthe brushes are of no service along such slopes; he must also sweep\r\nout the contents of any hole or hollow there may be in the streets,\r\nas is frequently the case when the pavement has been disturbed in\r\nthe relaying or repairing of the gas or water pipes. But for this\r\narrangement, I was told, the brushes would pass “clean over” such\r\nplaces, or only disturb without clearing away the dirt. Indeed\r\nirregularities of any kind in the pavement are great obstructions to\r\nthe efficiency of the street-sweeping machine.\r\n\r\nThere are some places, moreover, wholly unsweepable by the machine; in\r\nmany parts of St. Martin’s parish, for instance, there are localities\r\nwhere the machine cannot be introduced; such are--St. Martin’s-court;\r\nthe flagged ways about the National Gallery; and the approach,\r\nalongside the church, to the Lowther Arcade; the pavement surrounding\r\nthe fountains which adorn the “noblest site in Europe;” and a variety\r\nof alleys, passages, yards, and minor streets, which must be cleansed\r\nby manual labour.\r\n\r\nIn fair weather, again, water carts are indispensable before machine\r\nsweeping, for if the ground be merely dry and dusty, the set of brooms\r\nwill not “bite.”\r\n\r\nWe now come to estimate the _relative values of the mechanical and\r\nmanual labour applied to the scavaging of the streets_. The average\r\nprogress of the street-sweeping machine, in the execution of the\r\nscavagers’ work, is about two miles an hour. It must not be supposed,\r\nhowever, that two streets each a mile in length, could be swept in one\r\nhour; for to do this the vehicle would have to travel up and down those\r\nstreets as many times as the streets are wider than the machine. The\r\nmachines, sometimes two, sometimes three or four, follow alongside each\r\nother’s tracks in sweeping a street, so as to leave no part unswept.\r\nThus, supposing a street half a mile long and nine yards wide, and\r\nthat each machine swept a breadth of a yard, then three such machines,\r\ndriven once up, and once again down, and once more up such a street,\r\nwould cleanse it in three quarters of an hour. To do this by manual\r\nlabour in the same or nearly the same time, would require the exertions\r\nof five men. Each machine has been computed to have mechanical power\r\nequal to the industry of five street-sweepers; and such, from the above\r\ncomputation, would appear to be the fact. I do not include the drivers\r\nin this enumeration, as of course the horse in the scavagers’ cart, and\r\nin the machine require alike the care of a man, and there is to each\r\nvehicle (whether mechanical or not) one hand (besides the carman) to\r\nsweep after the ordinary work. Hence every two men with the machine do\r\nthe work of seven men by hand.\r\n\r\nHaving, then, ascertained the relative values of the two forces\r\nemployed in cleansing the streets, let me now proceed to set forth\r\nwhat is “the economy of labour” resulting from the use of the sweeping\r\nmachine. In the following table are given the number of men at present\r\nengaged by the machine company in the cleansing of those districts\r\nwhere the machine is in operation, as well as the annual amount of\r\nwages paid to the machine labourers; these facts are then collocated\r\nwith the number of manual labourers that would be required to do the\r\nsame work under the ordinary contract system (assuming every two\r\nlabourers with the machine to do the work of seven labourers by hand),\r\nas well as the amount of wages that would be paid to such manual\r\nlabourers; and finally, the number of men and amount of wages under the\r\none system of street-cleansing is subtracted from the other, in order\r\nto arrive at the number of street-sweepers at present displaced by\r\nmachine labour, and the annual loss in wages to the men so displaced;\r\nor, to speak economically, the last column represents the amount\r\nby which the Wage Fund of the street-sweepers is diminished by the\r\nemployment of the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF MEN AT PRESENT\r\nENGAGED IN STREET-SWEEPING BY MACHINES, AND THE NUMBER THAT WOULD BE\r\nREQUIRED TO SWEEP THE SAME DISTRICTS BY HAND, TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL\r\nAMOUNT OF WAGES ACCRUING TO EACH.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+----------------------------------+\r\n                       |

the men who are at present employed by the contractors,\r\nboth large and small, to sweep the street by hand to be superseded\r\nby it, what would be the result? how much money would the manual\r\nlabourers be deprived of per annum, and how many self-supporting\r\nlabourers would be pauperized thereby? The following table will show\r\nus: in the first compartment given below we have the number of\r\nmanual labourers employed throughout London by the large and small\r\ncontractors, and the amount of wages annually received by them[20];\r\nin the second compartment is given the number of men that would be\r\nrequired to sweep the same districts by the machine, and the amount of\r\nwages that would be received by them at the present rate; and the third\r\nand last compartment shows the gross number of hands that would be\r\ndisplaced, and the annual loss that would accrue to the operatives by\r\nthe substitution of mechanical for manual labour in the sweeping of the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTORS’ MEN\r\nAT PRESENT EMPLOYED TO SWEEP THE STREETS BY HAND, AND THE NUMBER THAT\r\nWOULD BE REQUIRED TO SWEEP THE SAME DISTRICTS BY MACHINE WORK, TOGETHER\r\nWITH THE AMOUNT OF WAGES ACCRUING TO EACH.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------------------------\r\n                        |              Manual Labour.\r\n                        +--------------------+-------------------\r\n                        | Number of          | Annual Wages\r\n                        | Men at present     | received by\r\n                        | employed           | Contractors’\r\n                        | by Contractors     | Men for\r\n                        | to sweep the       | sweeping the\r\n                        | streets.           | Streets, at 15_s._\r\n                        |                    | a Week.\r\n  ----------------------+--------------------+-------------------\r\n                        |                    |     £      _s._\r\n  Districts at present} |                    |\r\n    swept by large    } |        262         |  10,218     0\r\n    contractors  (see } |                    |\r\n    table, p. 214)    } |                    |\r\n                        |                    |\r\n  Districts swept by  } |         13         |     507     0\r\n    small contractors } |                    |\r\n  ----------------------+--------------------+-------------------\r\n        Total           |        275         |  10,725     0\r\n  ----------------------+--------------------+-------------------\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------------------------\r\n                        |             Machine Labour.\r\n                        +--------------------+-------------------\r\n                        | Number of          | Annual Wages\r\n                        | Machine Men        | that would be\r\n                        | that would be      | received by\r\n                        | required to        | Machine Men,\r\n                        | attend the         | at 16_s._ a\r\n                        | Street-sweeping    | Week.\r\n                        | Machines.          |\r\n  ----------------------+--------------------+-------------------\r\n                        |                    |     £      _s._\r\n  Districts at present} |                    |\r\n    swept by large    } |        75          |    3120     0\r\n    contractors  (see } |                    |\r\n    table, p. 214)    } |                    |\r\n                        |                    |\r\n  Districts swept by  } |         4          |     166     8\r\n    small contractors } |                    |\r\n  ----------------------+--------------------+-------------------\r\n        Total           |        79          |    3286     8\r\n  ----------------------+--------------------+-------------------\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------------------------\r\n                        |                Difference.\r\n                        +--------------------+-------------------\r\n                        | Number of          | Annual Loss\r\n                        | Men that           | that would\r\n                        | would be displaced | accrue to\r\n                        | by                 | Manual\r\n                        | Machine-work.      | Labourers by\r\n                        |                    | Machine-work.\r\n  ----------------------+--------------------+-------------------\r\n                        |                    |     £      _s._\r\n  Districts at present} |                    |\r\n    swept by large    } |        187         |    7098     0\r\n    contractors  (see } |                    |\r\n    table, p. 214)    } |                    |\r\n                        |                    |\r\n  Districts swept by  } |          9         |     340    12\r\n    small contractors } |                    |\r\n  ----------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n        Total           |        196         |    7438    12\r\n  ----------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n\r\nHere we find that nearly 200 men would be pauperized, losing upwards of\r\n7000_l._ per annum, if the street-sweeping machine came into general\r\nuse throughout London. But, before the introduction of machines, the\r\nthoroughfares of St. Martin’s parish were swept only once a week in\r\ndry weather, and three times a week in sloppy weather, and since the\r\nintroduction of the machines they have been swept daily; allowing,\r\ntherefore, the extra cleansing to have arisen from the extra cheapness\r\nof the machine work--though it seems to have been the result of\r\nimproved sanatory regulations, for in parts where the machine has not\r\nbeen used the same alteration has taken place--making such allowance,\r\nhowever, it may, perhaps, be fair to say, that the same increase of\r\ncleansing would take place throughout London; that is to say, that the\r\nstreets would be swept by the machines, were they generally used, twice\r\nas often as they are at present by hand. At this rate 158 machine men,\r\ninstead of 79 as above calculated, would be required for the work; so\r\nthat, reckoning for the increased employment which might arise from the\r\nincreased cheapness of the work, we see that, were the street-sweeping\r\nmachines used throughout the metropolis, nearly 120 of the 275 manual\r\nlabourers now employed at scavaging by the large and small contractors,\r\nwould be thrown out of work, and deprived of no less a sum than\r\n4680_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nThis amount, of course, the parishes would pocket, minus the sum that\r\nit would cost them to keep the displaced scavagers as paupers, so that\r\nin this instance, at least, we perceive that, however great a benefit\r\ncheapness may be to the wealthy classes, to the poorer classes it is\r\nfar from being of the same advantageous character; for, just as much as\r\nthe rate-payers are the gainers in the matter of street-cleansing must\r\nthe labourers be the losers--the economy of labour in a trade where\r\nthere are too many labourers already, and where the quantity of work\r\ndoes not admit of indefinite increase, meaning simply the increase of\r\npauperism[21].\r\n\r\nThe “_labour question_” as connected with the sweeping-machine work,\r\nrequires but a brief detail, as it presents no new features. The\r\nmajority of the machine men may be described as having been “general\r\n(unskilled) labourers” before they embarked in their present pursuits:\r\nlabourers for builders, brick-makers, rubbish-carters, the docks, &c.\r\n\r\nAmong them there is but one who was brought up as a mechanic; the\r\nothers have all been labourers, brick-makers, and what I heard called\r\n“barrow-workers” on railways, the latter being the most numerous.\r\n\r\nEmployment is obtained by application at the wharfs. There is nothing\r\nof the character of a trade society among the machine-men; nothing\r\nin the way of benefit or sick clubs, unless the men choose to enrol\r\nthemselves in a general benefit society, of which I did not hear one\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nThe payment is by the week, and without drawback in the guise or\r\ndisguise of fines, or similar inflictions for the use of tools, &c.;\r\nthe payment, moreover, is always in money.\r\n\r\nThe only perquisite is in the case of anything being found in the\r\nstreets; but the rule as to perquisites seems to be altogether an\r\nunderstanding among the men. The disposal of what may be picked up in\r\nthe streets appears, moreover, to be very much in the discretion of the\r\npicker up. If anything be found in the contents of the vehicle, when\r\nemptied, it is the perquisite of the driver, who is also the unloader;\r\nhe, however, is expected to treat the men “on the same beat” out of any\r\nsuch “treasure trove,” when the said treasure is considerable enough\r\nto justify such bounty. Odd sixpences, shillings, or copper coin, I\r\nwas informed, were found almost every week, but I could ascertain no\r\ngeneral average. One man, some time ago, found a purse inside the\r\nvehicle containing 20_s._, and “spent it out and out all on hisself,”\r\nin a carouse of three days. He lost his situation in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe number of men employed by the company in this trade is 24, and\r\nthese perform all the work required in the driving and attendance upon\r\nthe machines in the street, in loading the barges, grooming the horses,\r\n&c. There is, indeed, a twenty-fifth man, but he is a blacksmith, and\r\nhis wages of 35_s._ weekly are included in the estimate as to wear and\r\ntear given below, for he shoes the horses and repairs the machines.\r\n\r\nThe rate of wages paid by the machine company is 16_s._ a week, so that\r\nthe full amount of wages is paid to the men.\r\n\r\nBut though the company cannot be ranked among the grinders of the\r\nscavaging trade, they _must_ be placed among “the drivers.”\r\n\r\nI am assured, by those who are familiar with such labour, that the 24\r\nmen employed by the machine masters do the work of upwards of 30 in the\r\nhonourable trade, with a corresponding saving to their employers, from\r\nan adherence to the main point of the scurf system, the overworking of\r\nthe men without extra payment.\r\n\r\nIt has been before stated that, in dry weather, the roads require to be\r\nwatered before being swept, so that the brushes may _bite_. In summer\r\nthe machine-men sometimes commence this part of their business at three\r\nin the morning; and at the other periods of the year, sometimes at\r\nearly morning, when moonlight. In summer the hours of labour in the\r\nstreets are from three, four, five, or six in the morning, to half-past\r\nfour in the afternoon; in winter, from light to light, and after street\r\nthere may be yard and barge work.\r\n\r\nThe saving by this scurf system, then, is:--\r\n\r\n  30 men (honourable trade), 16_s._ weekly               £1248 yearly.\r\n  24 men (scurf-trade) doing same work, 16_s._ weekly      998    „\r\n                                                         -----\r\n  Saving to capitalist and loss to labourer               £250    „\r\n\r\nIt now but remains to sum up the capital, income, and expenditure of\r\nthe machine-scavaging trade.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a street-sweeping machine is 50_l._ to 60_l._, with an\r\nadditional 5_l._ 5_s._ for the set of brooms. The wear and tear of\r\nthese machines are very considerable. A man who had the care of one\r\ntold me that when there was a heavy stress on it he had known the iron\r\ncogs of the inner wheels “go rattle, rattle, snap, snap,” until it\r\nbecame difficult to proceed with the work. The brooms, too, in hard\r\nwork and “cloggy” weather, are apt to snap short, and in the regular\r\ncourse of wear have to be renewed every four or five weeks. The sets\r\nof brooms are of bass, worked strongly with copper wire. The whole\r\napparatus can be unscrewed and taken to pieces, to be cleaned or\r\nrepaired. The repairs, independently of the renewal of the brooms, have\r\nbeen calculated at 7_l._ yearly each machine. The capital invested,\r\nthen, in twelve street-sweeping machines, in the horses, and what may\r\nbe considered the appurtenances of the trade, together with the yearly\r\nexpenditure, may be thus calculated:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL OF STREET-SWEEPING MACHINE TRADE.\r\n\r\n  12 machines, 60_l._ each                    £720\r\n  12 sets of brooms, 5_l._ 5_s._ each set       63\r\n  19 horses, 25_l._ each                       475\r\n  4 water-carts, 20_l._ each                    80\r\n  19 sets of harness (new), 7_l._ each set     133\r\n  4 barges, 50_l._ each                        200\r\n                                             -----\r\n                                             £1671\r\n\r\n\r\nYEARLY EXPENDITURE.\r\n\r\n  24 men, 16_s._ weekly                                £998\r\n  120 sets of brooms for 12 machines, 4_l._ per set     480\r\n  Wear and tear, &c.

These were:--\r\n\r\n  1. The self-supporting manual labourers.\r\n  2. The self-supporting machine labourers.\r\n  3. The pauper labourers.\r\n  4. The “philanthropic” labourers.\r\n\r\nI have already set forth the distinguishing features of the first two\r\nof these different orders of workmen in connection with the scavaging\r\ntrade, and now proceed in due order to treat of the characteristics of\r\nthe third.\r\n\r\nThe subject of pauper labour generally is one of the most difficult\r\ntopics that the social philosopher can deal with. It is not possible,\r\nhowever, to do more here than draw attention to the salient points of\r\nthe question. The more comprehensive consideration of the matter must\r\nbe reserved till such time as I come to treat of the poor specially\r\nunder the head of those that cannot work.\r\n\r\nBy the 43 Eliz., which is generally regarded as the basis of the\r\nexisting poor laws in this country, it was ordained that in every\r\nparish a fund should be raised by local taxation, not merely for the\r\nrelief of the aged and infirm, but _for setting to work all persons\r\nhaving no means to maintain themselves, and using no ordinary or daily\r\ntrade of life to get their living by_.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, soon discovered that it was one thing to pass an act\r\nfor setting able-bodied paupers to work, and another thing to do so.\r\n“In every place,” as Mr. Thornton truly says in his excellent treatise\r\non “Over Population,” “there is only a certain amount of work to be\r\ndone,” (limited by the extent of the market) “and only a certain amount\r\nof capital to pay for it; and, if the number of workmen be more than\r\nproportionate to the work, employment can only be given to those who\r\nwant it by taking from those who have.”\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate this by the circumstances of the scavaging trade.\r\nThere are 1760 miles of streets throughout London, and these would seem\r\nto require about 600 scavagers to cleanse them. It is self-evident,\r\ntherefore, that if 400 paupers be “set” to sweep particular districts,\r\nthe same number of self-supporting labourers must be deprived of\r\nemployment, and if these cannot obtain work elsewhere, they of course\r\nmust become paupers too, and, seeking relief, be put upon the same kind\r\nof work as they were originally deprived of, and that only to displace\r\nand pauperize in their turn a similar number of independent operatives.\r\n\r\nThe work of a country then being limited (by the capital and market for\r\nthe produce), there can be but two modes of setting paupers to labour:\r\n(1) by throwing the self-supporting operatives out of employment\r\naltogether, and substituting pauper labourers in their stead; (2) by\r\ngiving a portion of the work to the paupers, and so decreasing the\r\nemployment, and consequently the wages, of the regular operatives. In\r\neither case, however, the independent labourers must be reduced to a\r\nstate of comparative or positive dependence, for _it is impossible to\r\nmake labourers of the paupers of an over-populated country without\r\nmaking paupers of the labourers_.\r\n\r\nSome economists argue that, as paupers are consumers, they should,\r\nwhenever they are able to work, be made producers also, or otherwise\r\nthey exhaust the national wealth, to which they do not contribute. This\r\nmight be a sound axiom were there work sufficient for all. But in an\r\nover-populated country there is not work enough, as is proven by the\r\nmere fact of the over-population; and the able-bodied paupers _are_\r\npaupers simply _because they cannot obtain work_, so that to employ\r\nthose who are out of work is to throw out those who are in work, and\r\nthus to pauperize the self-supporting.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter seems to hinge upon this one question--\r\n\r\nWho are to maintain the paupers? The ratepaying traders or the\r\nnon-ratepaying workmen?\r\n\r\nIf the paupers be set to work in a country like Great Britain, they\r\nmust necessarily be brought into competition with the self-supporting\r\nworkmen, and so be made to share the wage fund with them, decreasing\r\nthe price of labour in proportion to the extra number of such pauper\r\nlabourers among whom the capital of the trade has to be shared. Hence\r\nthe burden of maintaining the paupers will be virtually shifted from\r\nthe capitalist to the labourer, the poor-rate being thus really paid\r\nout of the wages of the operatives, instead of the profits of the\r\ntraders, as it should be.\r\n\r\nAnd here lies the great wrong of pauper labour. It saddles the poor\r\nwith the maintenance of their poorer brethren, while the rich not only\r\ncontribute nothing to their support, but are made still richer by the\r\nincreased cheapness resulting from the depreciation of labour and their\r\nconsequent ability to obtain a greater quantity of commodities for the\r\nsame amount of money.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this argument let us say the wages of 600\r\nindependent scavagers amount, at 15_s._ a week each the year through,\r\nto 23,400_l._ per annum; and let us say, moreover, that the keep of\r\n400 paupers amounts, at 5_s._ a week each, to, altogether, 5200_l._;\r\nhence the total annual expense to the several metropolitan parishes for\r\ncleansing the streets and maintaining 400 paupers would be 23,400_l._ +\r\n5200_l._ = 28,600_l._\r\n\r\nIf, however, the 400 paupers be set to scavaging work, and made to do\r\nsomething for their keep, one of two things _must_ follow: (1) either\r\nthe 400 extra hands will receive their share of the 23,400_l._ devoted\r\nto the payment of the operative scavagers, in which case the wages of\r\neach of the regular hands will be reduced from 15_s._ to 9_s._ a week;\r\nhence the maintenance of the paupers will be saddled upon the 600\r\nindependent operatives, who will lose no less than 9360_l._ per annum,\r\nwhile the ratepayers will be saved the maintenance of the 400 paupers\r\nand so gain 5200_l._ per annum by the change; (2) or else 400 of the\r\nself-supporting operatives must be thrown out of work, in which case\r\nthe displaced labourers will lose no less than 15,600_l._, while the\r\nratepayers will gain upwards of 5000_l._\r\n\r\nThe reader is now, I believe, in a position to comprehend the wrong\r\ndone to the self-supporting scavagers by the employment of pauper\r\nlabour in the cleansing of the streets.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the material of the roads of a parish seems, as far\r\nas the metropolis is concerned, at one time to have supplied the chief\r\n“test,” to which parishes have resorted, as regards the willingness\r\nto labour on the part of the able-bodied applicants for relief. When\r\nthe casual wards of the workhouses were open for the reception of\r\nall vagrants who sought a night’s shelter, each tramper was required\r\nto break so many stones in the morning before receiving a certain\r\nallowance of bread, soup, or what not for his breakfast; and he then\r\nmight be received again into the shelter of this casual asylum. In some\r\nparishes the wards were open without the test of stone-breaking, and\r\nthere was a crowded resort to them, especially during the prevalence\r\nof the famine in Ireland and the immigration of the Irish peasants to\r\nEngland. The favourite resort of the vagrants was Marylebone workhouse,\r\nand Irish immigrants very frequently presented slips of paper on\r\nwhich some tramper whom they had met with on their way had written\r\n“_Marylebone workhouse_,” as the best place at which they could apply,\r\nand these the simple Irish offered as passports for admission!\r\n\r\nGradually, the asylum of these wards, with or without labour tests,\r\nwas discontinued, and in one where the labour test used to be strongly\r\ninsisted upon--in St. Pancras--a school for pauper children has been\r\nerected on the site of the stone-yard.\r\n\r\nThis labour test was unequal when applied to all comers; for what\r\nwas easy work to an agricultural labourer, a railway excavator, a\r\nquarryman, or to any one used to wield a hammer, was painful and\r\nblistering to a starving tailor. Nor was the test enforced by the\r\noverseers or regarded by the paupers as a proof of willingness to work,\r\nbut simply as a punishment for poverty, and as a means of deterring the\r\nneedy from applying for relief. To make labour a punishment, however,\r\nis _not_ to destroy, but really to confirm, idle habits; it is to\r\ngive a deeper root to the vagrant’s settled aversion to work. “Well,\r\nI always thought it was unpleasant,” the vagabond will say to himself\r\n“_that_ working for one’s bread, and now I’m _convinced_ of it!” Again,\r\nin many of the workhouses the labour to which the paupers were set was\r\nof a manifestly unremunerative character, being work for mere work’s\r\nsake; and to apply people to unproductive labour is to destroy all the\r\nordinary motives to toil--to take away the only stimulus to industry,\r\nand remove the very will to work which the labour test was supposed to\r\ndiscover[22].\r\n\r\nThe labour test, then, or setting the poor to work as a proof of\r\ntheir willingness to labour, appears to be as foolish as it is\r\nvicious; the objections to it being--(1) the inequality of the test\r\napplied to different kinds of work-people; (2) the tendency of it to\r\nconfirm rather than weaken idle habits by making labour inordinately\r\nrepulsive; (3) the removal of the ordinary stimulus to industry by the\r\nunproductiveness of the work to which the poor are generally applied.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having dealt with the subject of parish labour as a test of\r\nthe willingness to work on the part of the applicants for relief, I\r\nwill proceed to deal with that portion of the work itself which is\r\nconnected with the cleansing of the streets.\r\n\r\nAnd first as to the employment of paupers at all in the streets. If\r\npauperism be a disgrace, then it is unjust to turn a man into the\r\npublic thoroughfares, wearing the badge of beggary, to be pointed\r\nat and scorned for his poverty, especially when we are growing so\r\nparticularly studious of our criminals that we make them wear masks\r\nto prevent even their faces being seen[23]. Nor is it consistent with\r\nthe principles of an enlightened national morality that we should\r\nforce a body of honest men to labour upon the highways, branded with\r\na degrading garb, like convicts. Neither is it _wise_ to do so, for\r\nthe shame of poverty soon becomes deadened by the repeated exposure to\r\npublic scorn; and thus the occasional recipient of parish relief is\r\nultimately converted into the hardened and habitual pauper. “Once a\r\npauper always a pauper,” I was assured was the parish rule; and here\r\nlies the _rationale_ of the fact. Not long ago this system of employing\r\n_badged_ paupers to labour in the public thoroughfares was carried to\r\na much more offensive extent than it is even at present. At one time\r\nthe pauper labourers of a certain parish had the attention of every\r\npasser-by attracted to them while at their work, for on the back of\r\neach man’s garb--a sort of smock-frock--was marked, with sufficient\r\nprominence, “CLERKENWELL. STOP IT!” This public intimation that the\r\nlabourers were not only paupers, but regarded as thieves, and expected\r\nto purloin the parish dress they wore, attracted public attention, and\r\nwas severely commented upon at a meeting. The “STOP IT!” therefore was\r\ncancelled, and the frocks are now _merely_ lettered “CLERKENWELL.”\r\nBefore the alteration the men very generally wore the garment inside\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe present dress of the parish scavagers is usually a loose\r\nsmock-frock, costing 1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._, and a glazed hat of about\r\nthe same price. In some cases, however, the men may wear these things\r\nor not, at their option.\r\n\r\nThe pauper scavagers employed by the several metropolitan parishes may\r\nbe divided into three classes:--\r\n\r\n1. The in-door paupers, who receive no wages whatever (their lodging,\r\nfood, and clothing being considered to be sufficient remuneration for\r\ntheir labour).\r\n\r\n2. The out-door paupers, who are paid partly in money and partly in\r\nkind, and employed in some cases three days and in others six days in\r\nthe week.\r\n\r\n These may be subdivided into--(_a_) the single men, who receive, or\r\n rather used to receive, 9_d._ and a quartern loaf for each of the\r\n three or more days they were so employed; (_b_) the married men with\r\n families, who receive 7_s._ and 3 quartern loaves a week to 1_s._\r\n 1-1/2_d._ and 1 quartern loaf for each day’s labour.\r\n\r\n3. The unemployed labourers of the district, who are set to scavaging\r\nwork by the parish, and paid a regular money wage--the employment\r\nbeing constant, and the rate of remuneration ranging from 1_s._ 3_d._\r\nto 2_s._ 6_d._ a day for each of the six days, or from 7_s._ 6_d._ to\r\n15_s._ a week.\r\n\r\nIn pp. 246, 247, I give a table of the wages paid by each of the\r\nmetropolitan parishes. This has been collected at great trouble in\r\norder to arrive at the truth on this most important matter, and for\r\nwhich purpose the several parishes have been personally visited. It\r\nwill be seen on reference to this document, that there is only one\r\nparish at present that employs its in-door paupers in the scavaging of\r\nthe public streets; and 3 parishes employing 48 out-door paupers, who\r\nare paid partly in money and partly in bread; the money remuneration\r\nranging from 1_s._ 1-1/2_d._ a day (paid by Clerkenwell) to 7_s._\r\na week (paid by Chelsea), and moreover 31 parishes employing 408\r\napplicants for relief (paupers they cannot be called), and paying them\r\nwholly in money, the remuneration ranging from 15_s._ per week to 7_s._\r\n6_d._ (paid by the Liberty of the Rolls), and the employment from 6\r\nto 3 days weekly. As a general rule it was found that the greatest\r\ncomplaints were made by the authorities as to the idleness of the poor,\r\nand by the poor as to the tyranny of the authorities, in those parishes\r\nwhere the remuneration was the least. In St. Luke’s, Chelsea, for\r\ninstance, where the remuneration is but 7_s._ a week and three loaves,\r\nthe criminations and recriminations by the parish functionaries and\r\nthe paupers were almost equally harsh and bitter. I should, however,\r\nobserve that the men employed in this parish spoke in terms of great\r\ncommendation of Mr. Pattison the surveyor, saying he always gave them\r\nto understand that they were free labourers, and invariably treated\r\nthem as such. The men at work for Bermondsey parish also spoke very\r\nhighly of their superintendent, who, it seems, has interested himself\r\nto obtain for them a foul-weather coat. Some of the highway boards or\r\ntrusts take all the pauper labourers sent them by the parish, while\r\nothers give employment only to such as please them. These boards\r\ngenerally pay good wages, and are in favour with the men.\r\n\r\nThe mode of working, as regards the use of the implements and the\r\nmanual labour, is generally the same among the pauper scavagers as I\r\nhave described in connection with the scavagers generally.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of what is the rate of parish pay to the poor who\r\nare employed as scavagers, is complicated by the different modes in\r\nwhich the employment is carried out, for, as we see, there is--1st, the\r\nscavaging labour, by workhouse inmates, without any payment beyond the\r\ncost of maintenance and clothing; 2nd, the “short” or three-days-a-week\r\nlabour, with or without “relief” in the bestowal of bread; and 3rd, the\r\nsix days’ work weekly, with a money wage and no bread, nor anything in\r\nthe form of payment in kind or of “relief.”\r\n\r\nLet me begin with the first system of labour above mentioned, viz.\r\nthe employment of the in-door paupers without wages of any kind,\r\ntheir food, lodging, and clothing being considered as equivalents for\r\ntheir work. The principal evil in connection with this form of parish\r\nwork is its compulsory character, the men regarding it not as so much\r\nwork given in exchange for such and such comforts, but as something\r\n_exacted_ from them; and, to tell the truth, it is precisely the\r\ncounterpart of slavery, being equally deficient in all inducement to\r\ntoil, and consequently requiring almost the same system of compulsion\r\nand supervision in order to keep the men at their labour. All interest\r\nin the work is destroyed, there being no reward connected with it; and\r\nconsequently the same organized system of setting to work is required\r\nas with cattle. There are but two inducements to voluntary action--pain\r\nto be avoided or pleasure to be derived--or, in other words, the\r\nattractiveness and repulsiveness of objects. Take away the pecuniary\r\nattraction of labour, and men become mere beasts of burden, capable\r\nof being set to work only by the dread of some punishment; hence the\r\nsystem of parish labour, which has no reward directly connected with\r\nit, must necessarily be tyrannical, and so tend to induce idleness and\r\na hatred of work altogether.\r\n\r\nOf the different forms of pauper work, street-sweeping is, I am\r\ninclined to believe, the most unpopular of all among the poor. The\r\nscavaging is generally done in the workhouse dress, and that to all,\r\nexcept the hardened paupers, and sometimes even to them, is highly\r\ndistasteful. Neither have such labourers, as I have said, the incentive\r\nof that hope of the reward which, however diminutive, still tends to\r\nsweeten the most repulsive labour. I am informed by an experienced\r\ngangsman under a contractor, that it is notorious that the workhouse\r\nhands are the least industrious scavagers in the streets. “They don’t\r\nsweep as well,” he said, “and don’t go about it like regular men; they\r\ntake it quite easy.” It is often asserted that this labour of the\r\nworkhouse men is applied as a _test_; but this opinion seems rather to\r\nbear on the past than the present.\r\n\r\nOne man thus employed gave me the following account. He was garrulous\r\nbut not communicative, as is frequently the case with men who love to\r\nhear themselves talk, and are not very often able to command listeners.\r\nHe was healthy looking enough, but he told me he was, or had been\r\n“delicate.” He querulously objected to be questioned about his youth,\r\nor the reason of his being a pauper, but seemed to be abounding in\r\nworkhouse stories and workhouse grievances.\r\n\r\n“Street-sweeping,” he said, “degrades a man, and if a man’s poor he\r\nhasn’t no call to be degraded. Why can’t they set the thieves and\r\npickpockets to sweep? they could be watched easy enough; there’s\r\nalways idle fellers as reckons theirselves real gents, as can be got\r\nfor watching and sitch easy jobs, for they gets as much for them, as\r\nthree men’s paid for hard work in a week. I never was in a prison, but\r\nI’ve heerd that people there is better fed and better cared for than\r\nin workusses. What’s the meaning of that, sir, I’d like for to know?\r\nYou can’t tell me, but I can tell you. The workus is made as ugly as\r\nit can be, that poor people may be got to leave it, and chance dying\r\nin the street rather.” [Here the man indulged in a gabbled detail of a\r\nseries of pauper grievances which I had a difficulty in diverting or\r\ninterrupting. On my asking if the other paupers had the same opinion\r\nas to street-sweeping as he had, he replied:--] “To be sure they has;\r\nall them that has sense to have a ’pinion at all has; there’s not two\r\nsides to it any how. No, I don’t want to be kept and do nothink. I want\r\n_proper_ work. And by the rights of it I might as well be kept with\r\nnothink to do as ---- or ----” [parish officials]. “Have they nothing\r\nto do,” I asked? “Nothink, but to make mischief and get what ought to\r\ngo to the poor. It’s salaries and such like as swallers the rates, and\r\nthat’s what every poor family knows as knows anythink. Did I ever like\r\nmy work better? Certainly not. Do I take any pains with it? Well, where\r\nwould be the good? I can sweep well enough, when I please, but if I\r\ncould do more than the best man as ever Mr. Darke paid a pound a week\r\nto, it wouldn’t be a bit better for me--not a bit, sir, I assure you.\r\nWe all takes it easy whenever we can, but the work _must_ be done. The\r\nonly good about it is that you get outside the house. It’s a change\r\nthat way certainly. But we work like horses and is treated like asses.”\r\n[On my reminding him that he had just told me that they all took it\r\neasy when they could, and _that_ rather often, he replied:] “Well,\r\ndon’t horses? But it ain’t much use talking, sir. It’s only them as has\r\nbeen in workusses and in parish work as can understand all the ins and\r\nouts of it.”\r\n\r\nIn giving the above and the following statements I have endeavoured to\r\nelicit the _feelings_ of the several paupers whom I conversed with.\r\nPoor, ignorant, or prejudiced men may easily be mistaken in their\r\nopinions, or in what they may consider their “facts,” but if a clear\r\nexposition of their sentiments be obtained, it is a guide to the\r\ntruth. I have, therefore, given the statement of the in-door pauper’s\r\nopinions, querulously as they were delivered, as I believe them to be\r\nthe sentiments of those of his class who, as he said, had any opinion\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nIt seems indeed, from all I could learn on the subject, that pauper\r\nstreet-work, even at the best, is unwilling and slovenly work, pauper\r\nworkmen being the worst of all workmen. If the streets be swept clean,\r\nit is because a dozen paupers are put to the labour of eight, nine,\r\nor ten regular scavagers who are independent labourers, and who may\r\nhave some “pride of art,” or some desire to show their employers that\r\nthey are to be depended upon. This feeling does not actuate the pauper\r\nworkman, who thinks or knows that if he did evince a desire and a\r\nperseverance to please, it would avail him little beyond the sneers and\r\nill-will of his mates; so that, even with a disposition to acquire the\r\ngood opinion of the authorities, there is this obstacle in his way, and\r\nto most men who move in a circumscribed sphere it is a serious obstacle.\r\n\r\nOf the second mode of pauper scavaging, viz., that performed by\r\nout-door paupers, and paid for partly in money and partly in kind,\r\nI heard from officials connected with pauper management very strong\r\ncondemnations, as being full of mischievous and degrading tendencies.\r\nThe payment to the out-door pauper scavager averages, as I have\r\nstated, 9_d._ a day to a single man, with, perhaps, a quartern loaf;\r\nand this, in some cases, is for only three days in the week; while\r\nto a married man with a family, it varies between 1_s._ 1-1/2_d._\r\nand 1_s._ 2_d._ a day, with a quartern, and sometimes two quartern\r\nloaves; and this, likewise, is occasionally from three to six days\r\nin the week. On this the single or family men must subsist, if they\r\nhave no other means of earning an addition. The men thus employed\r\nare certainly not independent labourers, nor are they, in the full\r\nsense of the word as popularly understood, paupers; for their means\r\nof subsistence are partly the fruits of their toil; and although they\r\nare wretchedly dependent, they seem to feel that they have a sort of\r\nright to be set to work, as the law ordains such modicum of relief, in\r\nor out of the workhouse, as will only ward off death through hunger.\r\nThis “three-days-a-week work” is by the poor or pauper labourers\r\nlooked upon as being, after the in-door pauper work, the worst sort of\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n[24] TABLE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF MEN EMPLOYED BY THE METROPOLITAN\r\nPARISHES AND HIGHWAY BOARDS IN SCAVAGING, AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF\r\nHOURS PER DAY AND NUMBER OF DAYS PER

--------------------+--------------------+-------------|------------+------------+-----------------\r\n\r\nFrom a married man employed by the parish under this mode, I had the\r\nfollowing account.\r\n\r\nHe was an intelligent-looking man, of about 35, but with nothing very\r\nparticular in his appearance unless it were a head of very curly hair.\r\nHe gave me the statement in his own room, which was larger than I have\r\nusually found such abodes, and would have been very bare, but that it\r\nwas somewhat littered with the vessels of his trade as a street-seller\r\nof Nectar, Persian Sherbet, Raspberryade, and other decoctions of\r\ncoloured ginger-beer, with high-sounding names and indifferent flavour:\r\nin the summer he said he could live better thereby, with a little\r\ncostering, than by street-sweeping, but being often a sickly man he\r\ncould not do so during the uncertainties of a winter street trade. His\r\nwife, a decent looking woman, was present occasionally, suckling one\r\nchild, about two years old--for the poor often protract the weaning of\r\ntheir children, as the mother’s nutriment is the _cheapest_ of all food\r\nfor the infant, and as the means of postponing the further increase of\r\ntheir family--whilst another of five or six years of age sat on a bench\r\nby her side. There was nothing on the walls in the way of an ornament,\r\nas I have seen in some of the rooms of the poor, for the couple had\r\nonce been in the workhouse, and might be driven there again, and with\r\nsuch apprehensions did not care, perhaps, to make a home otherwise than\r\nthey found it, even if the consumption of only a little spare time were\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe husband said:--\r\n\r\n“I was brought up as a type-founder; my father, who was one, learnt me\r\nhis trade; but he died when I was quite a young man, or I might have\r\nbeen better perfected in it. I was comfortably off enough then, and got\r\nmarried. Very soon after that I was taken ill with an abscess in my\r\nneck, you can see the mark of it still.” [He showed me the mark.] “For\r\nsix months I wasn’t able to do a thing, and I was a part of the time,\r\nI don’t recollect how long, in St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. I was weak\r\nand ill when I came out, and hardly fit for work; I couldn’t hear of\r\nany work I could get, for there was a great bother in the trade between\r\nmaster and men. Before I went into the hospital, there was money to pay\r\nto doctors; and when I came out I could earn nothing, so everything\r\nwent, yes, sir, everything. My wife made a little matter with charing\r\nfor families she’d lived in, but things are in a bad way if a poor\r\nwoman has to keep her husband. She was taken ill at last, and then\r\nthere was nothing but the parish for us. I suffered a great deal before\r\nit come to that. It was awful. No one can know what it is but them that\r\nsuffers it. But I didn’t know what in the world to do. We lived then in\r\nSt. Luke’s, and were passed to our own parish, and were three months\r\nin the workhouse. The living was good enough, better then than it is\r\nnow, I’ve heard, but I was miserable.” [“And I was _very_ miserable,”\r\ninterposed the wife, “for I had been brought up comfortable; my father\r\nwas a respectable tradesman in St. George’s-in-the-East, and I had been\r\nin good situations.”] “We made ourselves,” said the husband, “as useful\r\nas we could, but we were parted of course. At the three months’ end,\r\nI had 10_s._ given to me to come out with, and was told I might start\r\ncostermongering on it. But to a man not up to the trade, 10_s._ won’t\r\ngo very far to keep up costering. I didn’t feel master enough of my\r\nown trade by this time to try for work at it, and work wasn’t at all\r\nregular. There were good hands earning only 12_s._ a week. The 10_s._\r\nsoon went, and I had again to apply for relief, and got an order for\r\nthe stone-yard to go and break stones. Ten bushels was to be broken for\r\n15_d._ It was dreadful hard work at first. My hands got all blistered\r\nand bloody, and I’ve gone home and cried with pain and wretchedness.\r\nAt first it was on to three days before I could break the ten bushels.\r\nI felt shivered to bits all over my arms and shoulders, and my head\r\nwas splitting. I then got to do it in two days, and then in one, and\r\nit grew easier. But all this time I had only what was reckoned three\r\ndays’ work in a week. That is, you see, sir, I had only three times\r\nten bushels of stones given to break in the week, and earned only\r\n3_s._ 9_d._ Yes, I lived on it, and paid 1_s._ 6_d._ a week rent, for\r\nthe neighbours took care of a few sticks for us, and the parish or\r\na broker wouldn’t have found them worth carriage. My wife was then\r\nin the country with a sister. I lived upon bread and dripping, went\r\nwithout fire or candle (or had one only very seldom) though it wasn’t\r\nwarm weather. I can safely say that for eight weeks I never tasted one\r\nbite of meat, and hardly a bite of butter. When I couldn’t sleep of\r\na night, but that wasn’t often, it was terrible, very. I washed what\r\nbits of things I had then myself, and had sometimes to get a ha’porth\r\nof soap as a favour, as the chandler said she ‘didn’t make less than a\r\npenn’orth.’ If I eat too much dripping, it made me feel sick. I hardly\r\nknow how much bread and dripping I eat in a week. I spent what money I\r\nhad in it and bread, and sometimes went without. I was very weak, you\r\nmay be sure, sir; and if I’d had the influenza or anything that way, I\r\nshould have gone off like a shot, for I seemed to have no constitution\r\nleft. But my wife came back again and got work at charing, and made\r\nabout 4_s._ a week at it; but we were still very badly off. Then I got\r\nto work on the roads every day, and had 1_s._ and a quartern loaf a\r\nday, which was a rise. I had only one child then, but men with larger\r\nfamilies got two quartern loaves a day. Single men got 9_d._ a day.\r\nIt was far easier work than stone-breaking too. The hours were from\r\neight to five in winter, and from seven to six in summer. But there’s\r\nalways changes going on, and we were put on 1_s._ 1-1/2_d._ a day and\r\na quartern loaf, and only three days a week. All the same as to time\r\nof course. The bread wasn’t good; it was only cheap. I suppose there\r\nwas 20 of us working most of the times as I was. The gangsman, as you\r\ncall him, but that’s more for the regular hands, was a servant of the\r\nparish, and a great tyrant. Yes, indeed, when we had a talk among\r\nourselves, there was nothing but grumbling heard of. Some of the tales\r\nI’ve heard were shocking; worse than what I’ve gone through. Everybody\r\nwas grumbling, except perhaps two men that had been 20 years in the\r\nstreets, and were like born paupers. They didn’t feel it, for there’s\r\na great difference in men. They knew no better. But anybody might\r\nhave been frightened to hear some of the men talk and curse. We’ve\r\nstopped work to abuse the parish officers as might be passing. We’ve\r\nmobbed the overseers, and a number of us, I was one, were taken before\r\nthe magistrate for it; but we told him how badly we were off, and he\r\ndischarged us, and gave us orders into the workhouse, and told ’em to\r\nsee if nothing could be done for us. We were there till next morning,\r\nand then sent away without anything being said.\r\n\r\n“It’s a sad life, sir, is a parish worker’s. I wish to God I could\r\nget out of it. But when a man has children he can’t stop and say ‘I\r\ncan’t do this,’ and ‘I won’t do that.’ Last week, now, in costering, I\r\nlost 6_s._” [he meant that his expenses, of every kind, exceeded his\r\nreceipts by 6_s._], “and though I can distil nectar, or anything that\r\nway” [this was said somewhat laughingly], “it’s only when the weather’s\r\nhot and fine that any good at all can be done with it. I think, too,\r\nthat there’s not the money among working men that there once was.\r\nAnything regular in the way of pay must always be looked at by a man\r\nwith a family.\r\n\r\n“Of course the streets must be properly swept, and if I can sweep\r\nthem as well as Mr. Dodd’s men, for I know one of them very well, why\r\nshould I have only 3_s._ 4-1/2_d._ a week and three loaves, and he have\r\n16_s._, I think it is? I don’t drink, my wife knows I don’t” [the wife\r\nassented], “and it seems as if in a parish a man must be kept down when\r\nhe is down, and then blamed for it. I may not understand all about it,\r\nbut it looks queer.”\r\n\r\nFrom an _unmarried_ man, looking like a mere boy in the face, although\r\nhe assured me he was nearly 24, as far as he knew, I heard an account\r\nof his labour and its fruits as a parish scavager; also of his former\r\ncareer, which partakes greatly in its characteristics of the narratives\r\nI gave, toward the close of the first volume, of deserted, neglected,\r\nand runaway children.\r\n\r\nHe lived from his earliest recollection with an old woman whom he first\r\ncalled “grandmother,” and was then bid to call “aunt,” and she, some of\r\nthe neighbours told him, had “kept him out of his rights,” for she had\r\n4_s._ a week with him, so that there ought to have been money coming to\r\nhim when he grew up. I have sometimes heard similar statements from the\r\nignorant poor, for it is agreeable enough to them to fancy that they\r\nhave been wronged out of fortunes to which they were justly entitled,\r\nand deprived of the position and consequence in life which they ought\r\nto have possessed “by rights.” In the course of my inquiries among the\r\npoor women who supply the slop milliners’ shops with widows’ caps,\r\ncap fronts, women’s collars, &c., &c., I was told by one middle-aged\r\ncap-maker, a very silly person, that she would be worth 100,000_l._,\r\n“if she had her rights.” What those “rights” were she could not\r\nexplain, only that there was and had been a great deal of money in the\r\nfamily, and of course she had a right to her share, only she was kept\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nThe youth in question never heard of a father, and had been informed\r\nthat his mother had died when he was a baby. From what he told me, I\r\nthink it most probable that he was an illegitimate child, for whose\r\nmaintenance his father possibly paid the 4_s._ a week, perhaps to\r\nsome near relative of the deceased mother. The old woman, as well as\r\nI could make the matter out from his narrative, died suddenly, and,\r\nas little was known about her, she was buried by the parish, and the\r\nlad, on the evening of the funeral, was to have been taken by the\r\nlandlord of the house where they lodged into the workhouse; but the\r\nboy ran away before this could be accomplished; the parish of course\r\nnot objecting to be relieved of an incumbrance. He thought he was then\r\nabout twelve or thirteen years of age, and he had before run away from\r\ntwo schools, one a Ragged-school, to which he had been sent, “_for\r\nit was so confining_,” he said, “and one master, not he as had the\r\nraggeds, leathered him,” to use his own words, “tightly.” He knew his\r\nletters now, he thought, but that was all, “and very few,” he said,\r\ngravely, “would have put up with it so long as I did.” He subsisted as\r\nwell as he could by selling matches, penny memorandum books, onions,\r\n&c., after he had run away, sleeping under hedges in the country, or in\r\nlodging-houses in town, and living on a few pence a day, or “starving\r\non nothink.” He was taken ill, and believed it was of a fever, at or\r\nsomewhere about Portsmouth, and when he was sufficiently recovered,\r\nand had given the best account he could of himself, was passed to his\r\nparish in London. The relieving officer, he said, would have given him\r\na pair of shoes and half-a-crown, and let him “take his chance, but\r\nthe doctor wouldn’t sartify any ways.” He meant, I think, that the\r\nmedical officer found him too ill to be at large on his own account.\r\nHe discharged himself, however, in a few weeks from this parish\r\nworkhouse, as he was convalescent. “The grub there, you see, sir,” he\r\nsaid, “was stunning good when I first went, but it fell off.” As the\r\nprobability is that there was no change in the diet, it may not be\r\nunfair to conclude that the regular meals of the establishment were\r\nvery relishable at first, and that afterwards their very regularity and\r\ntheir little variation made the recipient critical.\r\n\r\n“When I left, sir,” he stated, “they guv me 2_s._ 6_d._, and a tidy\r\nshirt, and a pair of blucherers, and mended up my togs for me decent.\r\nI tried all sorts of goes then. I went to Chalk-farm and some other\r\nfairs with sticks for throwing, and used to jump among them as throwing\r\nwas going on, and to sing out, ‘break my legs and miss my pegs.’ I got\r\nmany a knock, and when I did, oh! there _was_ such larfing at the fun\r\non it. I sold garden sticks too, and garden ropes, and posts sometimes;\r\nbut it was all wery poor pay. Sometimes I made 10_d._, but not never\r\nI think but twice 1_s._ a day at it, and oftener 6_d._, and in bad\r\nweather there was nothink to be done. If I made 6_d._ clear, it was\r\n1_d._ for cawfee--for I often went out fasting in a morning--and 1_d._\r\nfor bread and butter, and 1_d._ for pudden for dinner, and another\r\n1_d._ perhaps for beer--half-pint and a farden out at the public\r\nbar--and 2_d._ for a night’s lodging. I’ve had sometimes to leave half\r\nmy stock in flue with a deputy for a night’s rest. O, I didn’t much\r\nmind the bugs, so I could rest; and next day had to take my things out\r\nif I could, and pay a hexter ha’penny or penny, for hintrest, like.\r\nYes, I’ve made 18_d._ a hevening at a fair; but there’s so many a\r\ngoing it there that one ruins another, and wet weather ruins the whole\r\nbiling, the pawillion, theaytres and all. I never was a hactor, never;\r\nbut I’ve thought sometimes I’d like to try my hand at it. I may some\r\nday, ’cause I’m tall. I was forced to go to the parish again, for I\r\ngot ill and dreadful weak, and then they guv me work on the roads. I\r\ncan’t just say how long it’s since, two or three year perhaps, but I\r\nhad 9_d._ a day at first, and reglar work, and then three days and\r\nthree loaves a week, and then three days and no loaves. I haven’t been\r\nat it werry lately. I’ve rayther taken the summer out of myself, but\r\nI must go back soon, for cold weather’s a coming. Vy, I lived a good\r\ndeal on carrying trunks from the busses to Euston Railway; a good\r\nmany busses stops in the New-road, in the middle of the square. Some\r\nwas foreigners, and they was werry scaly. No, I never said nothink\r\nbut once, ven I got two French ha’pennies for carrying a heavy old\r\nleather thing, like a coach box, as seemed to belong to a family; and\r\nthen the railway bobbies made me hold my tongue. I jobbed about in\r\nother places too, but the time’s gone by now. O, I had a deal to put\r\nup with last winter. What is 9_d._ a day for three days? and if poor\r\nmen had their rights, times ’ud be different. I’d like to know where\r\nall the money goes. I never counted how many parish sweepers there\r\nwas; too many by arf. I’ve a rights to work, and it’s as little as a\r\nparish can do to find it. I pay 1_s._ a week for half a bed, and not\r\nhalf enough bed-clothes; but me and Jack Smith sometimes sleeps in our\r\nclothes, and sometimes spreads ’em o’ top. No, poor Jack, he hasn’t no\r\nhold on a parish; he’s a mud-lark and a gatherer [bone-grubber]. Do\r\nI like the overseers and the parish officers? In course not, nobody\r\ndoes. Why don’t they? Well, how can they? that’s just where it is. Ven\r\nI haven’t been at sweeping, I’ve staid in bed as long as I was let;\r\nbut Mother B.--I don’t know no other name she has--wouldn’t stand it\r\nafter ten. O no, it wern’t a common lodging-house, a sort of private\r\nlodging-house perhaps, where you took by the week. If I made nothink\r\nbut my ninepences, I lived on bread and cawfee, or bread and coker,\r\nand sometimes a red herring, and I’ve bought ’em in the Brill at five\r\nand six a penny. Mother B. charged 1/2_d._ for leave to toast ’em on\r\nher gridiron. She _is_ a scaly old ----. _I’ve oft spent all my money\r\nin a tripe supper at night, and fasted all next day._ I used to walk\r\nabout and look in at the cook-shop windows, and try for a job next\r\nday. _I’d have gone five miles for anybody for a penn’orth of pudden._\r\nNo, I never thought of making away with myself; never. Nor I never\r\nthought of going for a soldier; _it wouldn’t suit me to be tied so_.\r\nWhat I want is this here--regular work and no jaw. O, I’m sometimes as\r\nmiserable as hunger’ll make a parson, if ever he felt it. Yes, I go to\r\nchurch sometimes when I’m at work for the parish, if I’m at all togged.\r\nNo doubt I shall die in the workus. You see there’s nobody in the world\r\ncares for me. I can’t tell just how I spend my money; just as it comes\r\ninto my head. No, I don’t care about drinking; it don’t agree with me;\r\nbut there’s some can live on it. I don’t think as I shall ever marry,\r\nthough who knows?”\r\n\r\nThe third and last system of parish work is where the labourer is\r\nemployed regularly, and paid a fixed wage, out of the parochial fund\r\ncertainly, but not in the same manner as the paupers are paid, nor with\r\nany payment in kind (as in loaves), but all in money. The payment in\r\nthis wise is usually 1_s._ 6_d._ a day, and, but for such employment,\r\nthe poor so employed, would, in most instances, apply for relief.\r\n\r\nIn one parish, where the poor are regularly employed in street\r\nsweeping, and paid a regular wage in money, the whole scavaging work is\r\ndone by the paupers, as they are usually termed, though they are not\r\n“on the rate.” By them the streets are swept and the houses dusted,\r\nthe granite broken for macadamization, and the streets and roads\r\nrepaved or repaired. This is done by about 50 men, the labour in the\r\ndifferent departments I have specified being about equally apportioned\r\nas to the number employed in each. The work is executed without any\r\ndirect intervention of the parish officers employed in administering\r\n_relief_ to the poor, but through the agency of a board. All the men,\r\nhowever, are the poor of the parish, and but for this employment would\r\nor might claim relief, or demand admittance with their families into\r\nthe workhouse. The system, therefore, is one of indirect pauper labour.\r\nNearly all the men have been unskilled labourers, the exception being\r\nnow and then a few operatives in such handicrafts as were suffering\r\nfrom the dearth of employment. Some of the artizans, I was informed,\r\nwould be earning their 9_s._ in the stone-yard one week, and the next\r\ngetting 30_s._ at their business. The men thus labouring for the parish\r\nare about three-fifths Irishmen, a fifth Welchmen, or rather more than\r\na fifth, and the remainder Englishmen. There is not a single Scotchman\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nThere is no difference, in the parish I allude to, between the wages\r\nof married and single men, but men with families are usually preferred\r\namong the applicants for such work. They all reside in their own rooms,\r\nor sometimes in lodging-houses, but this rests with themselves.\r\n\r\nI had the following account from a heavy and healthy-looking\r\nmiddle-aged man, dressed in a jacket and trousers of coarse corduroy.\r\nThere is so little distinctive about it, however, that I will not\r\nconsume space in presenting it in the narrative form in which I noted\r\nit down. It may suffice that the man seemed to have little recollection\r\nas to the past, and less care as to the future. His life, from all\r\nI could learn from him, had been spent in what may be called menial\r\nlabour, as the servant, not of an individual, but of a parish; but\r\nthere was nothing, he knew of, that he had to thank anybody for--parish\r\nor any one. They wanted _him_ and he wanted _them_. On my asking him if\r\nhe had never tried to “better himself,” he said that he _had_ once as a\r\nnavvy, but a blow on the head and eye, from a portion of rock shivered\r\nby his pick-axe, disabled him for awhile, and he left railway work.\r\nHe went to church, as was expected of him, and he and his wife liked\r\nit. He had forgotten how to read, but never was “a dab at it,” and\r\nso “didn’t know nothing about the litany or the psalms.” He couldn’t\r\nsay as he knew any difference between the Church of England and the\r\nRoman Catholic church-goers, “cause the one was a English and the t’\r\nother a Irish religion,” and he “wasn’t to be expected to understand\r\nIrish religion.” He saw no necessity to put by money (this he said\r\nhesitatingly), supposing he could; what was his parish for? and he\r\nwould take care he didn’t lose his settlement. If he’d ever had such a\r\nchance as some had he might have saved money, but he never had. He had\r\nno family, and his wife earned about 4_s._ a week, but not every week,\r\nin a wool warehouse, and they did middling.\r\n\r\nThe above, then, are the modes in which paupers, or imminent paupers,\r\nso to speak, are employed, and in one way or other are _paid_ for their\r\nlabour, or what is called paid, and who, although parish menials, still\r\nreside in their own abodes, with the opportunity, such as it is, of\r\n“looking out” for better employment.\r\n\r\nAs to the _moral qualities of the street-sweeping paupers_ I do not\r\nknow that they differ from those of paupers generally. All men who feel\r\nthemselves sunk into compulsory labour and a degraded condition are\r\ndissatisfied, and eager to throw the blame of their degradation from\r\ntheir own shoulders. But it is evident that these men are unwilling\r\nworkers, because their work is deprived of its just reward; and\r\nalthough I did not hear of any difficulty being experienced in getting\r\nthem to work, I was assured by many who knew them well, that they do\r\nnot go about it with any alertness. Did any one ever hear a pauper\r\nwhistle or sing at his street-work? I believe that every experienced\r\nvestryman will agree to the truth of the statement that it is very\r\nrarely a confirmed pauper rises from his degradation. His thoughts\r\nand aspirations seem bounded by the workhouse and the parish. The\r\nreason appears to be because the workhouse authorities seek rather to\r\ndegrade than to elevate the man, resorting to every means of shaming\r\nthe pauper, until at last he becomes so utterly callous to the disgrace\r\nof pauperism that he does not care to alter his position. The system,\r\ntoo, adopted by the parish authorities of not paying for work, or\r\npaying less than the ordinary prices of the trade, causes the pauper\r\nlabourers to be unwilling workers; and finding that industry brings\r\nno reward, or less than its fair reward, to them, they get to hate\r\nall work, and to grow up habitual burdens on the State. Crabbe, the\r\npoet, who in all questions of borough and parish life is an authority,\r\nmakes his workhouse boy, Dick Monday, who when a boy got more kicks\r\nthan halfpence, die Sir Richard Monday, of Monday-place; but this is a\r\nflight on the wings of poetical licence; certainly not impossible, and\r\nthat is all which can be said for its likelihood.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks on the payment of the parish street-sweepers are\r\nfrom one of Mr. Cochrane’s publications:--\r\n\r\n“The council considers it a duty to the poor to touch upon the\r\nniggardly manner in which parish scavengers are generally paid, and\r\nthe deplorable and emaciated condition which they usually present,\r\nwith regard to their clothing and personal appearance. One contractor\r\npays 16_s._ 6_d._ per week; 2 pay 16_s._; 12 (including a Highway\r\nBoard) pay 15_s._ each; 1 pays 14_s._ 6_d._; 2 pay 14_s._; and 1 pays\r\nso low as 12_s._ On the other hand, five parish boards of ‘guardians\r\nof the poor,’ pay only 9_s._ each, to their miserable mud-larks; one\r\npays 8_s._; another 7_s._ 5_d._; a third 7_s._; a fourth compensates\r\nits labourers--in the British metropolis, where rent and living are\r\nnecessarily higher than elsewhere--with 5_s._ 8_d._ per week! whilst\r\na fifth pays 3 men 15_s._ each, 12 men 10_s._ each, and 6 men 7_s._\r\n6_d._ each, for exactly the same kind of work!!! But what renders this\r\nmean torture of men (because they happen to be poor) absurd as well\r\nas cruel, are the anomalous facts, that whilst the guardians of one\r\nparish pay 5 men 7_s._ each, the contractor for another part of the\r\nsame parish, pays his 4 men 14_s._ each;--and whilst the guardians of\r\na second parish pay only 5_s._ 8_d._, the Highway Board pays 15_s._\r\nto each of its labourers, for performing exactly the same work in the\r\nsame district!--Mr. Darke, scavenging contractor of Paddington, lately\r\nstated that he never had, and never would, employ any man at less\r\nthan 16_s._ or 18_s._ per week;--and Mr. Sinnott, of Belvidere-road,\r\nLambeth, about three months since, offered to certain West-End\r\nguardians, to take 40 paupers out of their own workhouse to cleanse\r\ntheir own parish, on the street-orderly system;--and to pay them\r\n15_s._ per week each man[25]; but the economical guardians preferred\r\nfilth and a full workhouse, to cleanliness, Christian charity, and\r\ncommon sense;--and so the proposal of this considerate contractor\r\nwas rejected! It is certainly far from being creditable to boards of\r\ngentlemen and wealthy tradesmen who manage parish affairs, to pay\r\nlittle more than one-half the wages that an individual does, to poor\r\nlabourers who cannot choose their employment or their masters....\r\n\r\n“The broken-down tradesman, the journeyman deprived of his usual work\r\nby panic or by poverty of the times, the ingenious mechanic, or the\r\nunsuccessful artist, applies at the parish labour-market for leave\r\nto live by other labour than that which hitherto maintained him in\r\ncomfort.... The usual language of such persons, even when applying for\r\nprivate alms or parochial relief, is, not that they want money, but\r\n‘that they have long been out of work;’ ‘that their particular trade\r\nhas been overstocked with apprentices, or superseded by machinery;’ or,\r\n‘that their late employer has become bankrupt, or has discharged the\r\nmajority of his hands from the badness of the times.’ To a man of this\r\nclass, the guardian of the poor replies, ‘We will test your willingness\r\nto labour, by employing you in the stone-yard, or to sweep the streets;\r\nbut the parish being heavily burthened with rates, we cannot afford\r\nmore than 7_s._ or 8_s._ a week.’ The poor creature, conscious of his\r\nown helplessness, accepts the miserable pittance, in order to preserve\r\nhimself and family from immediate starvation....\r\n\r\n“The council has taken much pains to ascertain the wages, and mode of\r\nexpenditure of them, by this uncared-for, and almost pariah, class\r\nof labourers throughout the metropolitan parishes; and it possesses\r\nundeniable proofs, that few possess any further garment than the rags\r\nupon their backs; some being even without a change of linen; that they\r\nnever enter a place of worship, on account of their want of decent\r\nclothing; that their wives and children are starved and in rags, and\r\nthe latter without the least education; that they never by any chance\r\ntaste fresh animal food; that one-third of their hard earnings is paid\r\nfor rent; and that their only sustenance (unless their wives happen to\r\ngo out washing or charing), consists of bread, potatoes, coarse tea\r\nwithout milk or sugar, a salt herring two or three times a week, and\r\na slice of rusty bacon on Sunday morning! The meal called dinner they\r\nnever know; their only refection being breakfast and ‘tea:’ beer they\r\ndo not taste from year’s end to year’s end; and any other luxury, or\r\neven necessary, is out of the question.\r\n\r\n“Of the 21 scavengers employed by St. James’s parish in 1850, no less\r\nthan 16,” says Mr. Cochrane’s report, “were married, with from one to\r\nfour children each. How the poor creatures who receive but 7_s._ 6_d._\r\na week support their families, is best known to themselves.”\r\n\r\nLet me now, in conclusion, endeavour to arrive at a rough estimate\r\nas to the sum of which the pauper labours annually are mulct by the\r\nbefore-mentioned rates of remuneration, estimating their labour at the\r\nmarket value or amount paid by the honourable contractors, viz. 16_s._\r\na week; for if private individuals can afford to pay that wage, and yet\r\nreap a profit out of the transaction, the guardians of the poor surely\r\ncould and should pay the same prices, and not avail themselves of\r\nstarving men’s necessities to reduce the wages of a trade to the very\r\nquick of subsistence. If it be a sound principle that the condition\r\nof the pauper should be rendered _less_ desirable than that of the\r\nlabourer, assuredly the principle is equally sound that the condition\r\nof the labourer should be made _more_ desirable than that of the\r\npauper; for if to pamper the pauper be to make indolence more agreeable\r\nthan industry, certainly to grind down the wages of the labourer is to\r\nrender industry as unprofitable as indolence. In either case the same\r\npremium is proffered to pauperism. As yet the Poor-Law Commissioners\r\nhave seen but one way of reducing the poor-rates, viz., by rendering\r\nthe state of the pauper as _unenviable_ as possible, and they have\r\nwholly lost sight of the other mode of attaining the same end, viz.,\r\nby making the state of the labourer as _desirable_ as possible. To\r\ninstitute a terrible poor law without maintaining an attractive form of\r\nindustry, is to hold out a boon to crime. If the wages of the working\r\nman are to be reduced to bare subsistence, and the condition of the\r\npauper is to be rendered worse than that of the working man, what\r\natrocities will not be committed upon the poor. Elevate the condition\r\nof the labourer, and there will be no necessity to depress the pauper.\r\nMake work more attractive by increasing the reward for it, and laziness\r\nwill necessarily become more repulsive. As it is, however, the pauper\r\nis not only kept at the very lowest point of subsistence, but his\r\nhalf-starved labour is brought into competition with that of men living\r\nin a comparative state of comfort; and the result, of course, is, that\r\ninstead of decreasing the number of paupers or poor-rates, we make\r\npaupers of our labourers, and fill our workhouses by such means. If\r\na scavager’s labour be worth from 12_s._ to 15_s._ per week in the\r\nmarket, what moral right have the _guardians of the poor_ to pay 5_s._\r\n8_d._ for the same commodity? If the paupers are set to do work which\r\nis fairly worth 15_s._, then to pay them little more than one-third of\r\nthe regular value is not only to make unwilling workers of the paupers,\r\nbut to drag down all the better workmen to the level of the worst.\r\n\r\nIt may be estimated that the outlay on pauper labour, as a whole, after\r\ndeducting the sum paid to superintendents and gangers, does not exceed\r\n10_s._ weekly per individual; consequently the lowering of the price of\r\nlabour is in this ratio: There are now, in round numbers, 450 pauper\r\nscavagers in the metropolis, and the account stands thus:--\r\n\r\n                                          Yearly.\r\n      450 scavagers, at the regular\r\n  weekly wages of 16_s._ each             £18,710\r\n      450 pauper labourers, 10_s._ each\r\n  weekly                                   11,700\r\n                                          -------\r\n        Lower price of pauper work         £7,020\r\n\r\nHence we see, that the great scurf employers of the scavagers, after\r\nall, are the guardians of the poor, compared with whom the most\r\ngrasping contractor is a model of liberality.\r\n\r\nThat the minimum of remuneration paid by the parishes has tended,\r\nand is tending more and more, to the general depreciation of wages\r\nin the scavaging trade, there is no doubt. It has done so directly\r\nand indirectly. One man, who had been a last-maker, told me that he\r\nleft his employment as a London scavager, for he had “come down to\r\nthe parish,” and set off at the close of the summer into Kent for the\r\nharvest and hopping, for, when in the country, he had been more\r\nused to agricultural labour than to last, clog, or patten making.\r\nHe considered that he had not been successful; still he returned to\r\nLondon a richer man by 26_s._ 6_d._ Nearly 20_s._ of this soon went for\r\nshoes and necessary clothing, and to pay some arrears of rent, and a\r\nchandler’s bill he owed, after which he could be trusted again where he\r\nwas known. He applied to the foreman of a contractor, whom he knew, for\r\nwork. “What wage?” said the foreman. “Fifteen shillings a week,” was\r\nthe reply. “Why, what did you get from the parish for sweeping?” “Nine\r\nshillings.” “Well,” said the foreman, “I know you’re a decent man, and\r\nyou were recommended before, and so I _can_ give you four or five days\r\na week at 2_s._ 4_d._ a day, and no nonsense about hours; _for you know\r\nyourself I can get 50 men as have been parish workers at 1s. 9d. a day,\r\nand jump at it, and so you mustn’t be cheeky_.” The man closed with the\r\noffer, knowing that the foreman spoke the truth.\r\n\r\nA contractor told me that he could obtain “plenty of hands,” used to\r\nparish scavaging work, at 10_s._ 6_d._ to 12_s._ a week, whereas he\r\npaid 16_s._\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that the system of pauper work in scavaging has\r\ncreated an increasing market for cheap and deteriorated labour, a\r\nmarket including hundreds of the unemployed at other unskilled labours;\r\nand it is hardly to be doubted that the many who have faith in the\r\ndoctrine that it is the best policy to buy in the cheapest and sell in\r\nthe dearest market, will avail themselves of the low-priced labour of\r\nthis pauper-constituted mart.\r\n\r\nIt is but right to add, that those parishes which pay 15_s._ a week\r\nare as worthy of commendation as those which pay 9_s._, 7_s._ 6_d._\r\nand 7_s._ per week, and 1_s._ 4_d._ and 1_s._ 1-1/2_d._ a day are\r\nreprehensible; and, unfortunately, the latter have a tendency to\r\nregulate all the others.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STREET-ORDERLIES.\r\n\r\nThis constitutes the last of the four varieties of labour employed in\r\nthe cleansing of the public thoroughfares of London. I have already\r\ntreated of the self-supporting manual labour, the self-supporting\r\nmachine labour, and the pauper labour, and now proceed to the\r\nconsideration of the philanthropic labour of the streets.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let us understand clearly what is meant by\r\nphilanthropic labour, and how it is distinguished from pauper labour on\r\nthe one hand, and self-supporting labour on the other. Self-supporting\r\nlabour I take to be that form of work which returns not less, and\r\ngenerally something more, than is expended upon it. Pauper labour,\r\non the other hand, is work to which the applicants for parish relief\r\nare “set,” not with a view to the profit to be derived from it, but\r\npartly as a test of their willingness to work, and partly as a means\r\nof employing the unemployed; while philanthropic labour is employment\r\nprovided for the unemployed with the same disregard of profit as\r\ndistinguishes pauper labour, but with a greater regard for the poor,\r\nand as a means of affording them relief in a less degrading manner\r\nthan is done under the present Poor Law. Pauper and philanthropic\r\nlabour, then, differ essentially from self-supporting labour in being\r\n_non-profitable_ modes of employment; that is to say, they yield so\r\nbare an equivalent for the sum expended upon the labourers, that\r\nnone, in the ordinary way of trade, can be found to provide the means\r\nnecessary for putting them into operation: while pauper labour differs\r\nfrom philanthropic labour, in the fact that the funds requisite for\r\n“setting the poor on work” are provided by law as a matter of social\r\npolicy, whereas, in the case of philanthropic labour, the funds,\r\nor a part of them, are supplied by voluntary contributions, out of\r\na desire to improve the labourers’ condition. There are, then, two\r\ndistinguishing features in all philanthropic labour--the one is, that\r\nit yields no profit (if it did it would become a matter of trade), and\r\nthe other, that it is instituted and maintained from a wish to benefit\r\nthe labourer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET ORDERLIES.]\r\n\r\nThe Street-Orderly system forms part of the operations on behalf of\r\nthe poor adopted by a society, of which Mr. Charles Cochrane is the\r\npresident, entitled the “National Philanthropic Association,” which is\r\nsaid to have for its object “the promotion of social and salutiferous\r\nimprovements, street cleanliness, and the employment of the poor, so\r\nthat able-bodied men may be prevented from burthening the parish-rate,\r\nand preserved independent of workhouse, alms, and degradation.” Here a\r\ntwofold object is expressed: the Philanthropic Association seeks not\r\nonly to benefit the poor by giving them employment, and “preserving\r\nthem independent of workhouse, alms, and degradation,” but to benefit\r\nthe public likewise, by “promoting social and salutiferous improvements\r\nand street cleanliness.” I shall deal with each of these objects\r\nseparately; but first let me declare, so as to remove all suspicion\r\nof private feelings tending in any way to bias my judgment in this\r\nmost important matter, that I am an utter stranger to the President\r\nand Council of the Philanthropic Association; and that, whatever I may\r\nhave to say on the subject of the street-orderlies, I do simply in\r\nconformity with my duty to the public--to state truthfully all that\r\nconcerns the labourers and the poor of the metropolis.\r\n\r\n_Viewed economically, philanthropic and pauper work may be said to be\r\nthe regulators of the minimum rate of wages_--establishing the lowest\r\npoint to which competition can possibly drive down the remuneration\r\nfor labour; for it is evident, that if the self-supporting labourer\r\ncannot obtain greater comforts by the independent exercise of his\r\nindustry than the parish rates or private charity will afford him, he\r\nwill at once give over working for the trading employer, and declare\r\non the funds raised by assessment or voluntary subscription for his\r\nsupport. Hence, those who wish well to the labourer, and who believe\r\nthat cheapness of commodities is desirable “only,” as Mr. Stewart\r\nMill says (p. 502, vol. ii.), “when the cause of it is, that their\r\nproduction costs little labour, and not when occasioned by that\r\nlabour’s being ill-remunerated;” and who believe, moreover, that\r\nthe labourer is to be benefited solely by the cultivation of a high\r\nstandard of comfort among the people--to such, I say, it is evident,\r\nthat a poor law which reduces the relief to able-bodied labourers\r\nto the smallest modicum of food consistent with the continuation of\r\nlife must be about the greatest curse that can possibly come upon\r\nan over-populated country, admitting, as it does, of the reduction\r\nof wages to so low a point of mere brutal existence as to induce\r\nthat recklessness and improvidence among the poor which is known to\r\ngive so strong an impetus to the increase of the people. A minimized\r\nrate of parish relief is necessarily a minimized rate of wages, and\r\nadmits of the labourers’ pay being reduced, by pauper competition, to\r\nlittle short of starvation; and such, doubtlessly, would have been\r\nthe case long ago in the scavaging trade by the employment of parish\r\nlabour, had not the Philanthropic Association instituted the system of\r\nstreet-orderlies, and by the payment of a higher rate of wages than the\r\nmore grinding parishes afforded--by giving the men 12_s._ instead of\r\n9_s._ or even 7_s._ a week--prevented the remuneration of the regular\r\nhands being dragged down to an approximation to the parish level.\r\nHence, rightly viewed, philanthropic labour--and, indeed, pauper labour\r\ntoo--comes under the head of a remedy for low wages, as preventing, if\r\nproperly regulated, the undue depreciation of industry from excessive\r\ncompetition, and it is in this light that I shall now proceed to\r\nconsider it.\r\n\r\nThe several plans that have been propounded from time to time, as\r\nremedies for an insufficient rate of remuneration for work, are as\r\nmultifarious as the circumstances influencing the three requisites\r\nfor production--labour, capital, and land. I will here run over as\r\nbriefly as possible--abstaining from the expression of all opinion on\r\nthe subject--the various schemes which have been proposed with this\r\nobject, so that the reader may come as prepared as possible to the\r\nconsideration of the matter.\r\n\r\nThe remedies for low wages may be arranged into two distinct groups,\r\nviz., those which seek to increase the labourer’s rate of pay\r\n_directly_, and those which seek to do so _indirectly_.\r\n\r\nThe _direct_ remedies for low wages that have been propounded are:--\r\n\r\n A. _The establishment of a standard rate of remuneration for labour._\r\n This has been proposed to be brought about by three different means,\r\n viz.:--\r\n\r\n   1. By law or government authority; either (_a_) fixing the minimum\r\n   rate of wages, and leaving the variations above that point to be\r\n   adjusted by competition (this, as we have seen, is the effect of the\r\n   poor-law); or, (_b_) settling the rate of wages generally by means\r\n   of local boards of trade for _conseils de prud’hommes_, consisting\r\n   of delegates from the workmen and employers, to determine, by the\r\n   principles of natural equity, a _reasonable_ scale of remuneration in\r\n   the several trades, their decision being binding in law on both the\r\n   employers and the employed.\r\n\r\n   2. By public opinion; this has been generally proposed by those\r\n   who are what Mr. Mill terms “shy of admitting the interference of\r\n   authority in contracts for labour,” fearing that if the law intervened\r\n   it would do so rashly and ignorantly, and desiring to compass by\r\n   _moral_ sanction what they consider useless or dangerous to attempt\r\n   to bring about by _legal_ means. “Every employer,” says Mr. Mill,\r\n   “they think, _ought_ to give _sufficient wages_,” and if he does not\r\n   give such wages willingly, he should be compelled to do so by public\r\n   opinion.\r\n\r\n   3. By trade societies or combination among the workmen; that is to\r\n   say, by the payment of a small sum per week out of the wages of the\r\n   workmen, towards the formation of a fund for the support of such of\r\n   their fellow operatives as may be out of employment, or refuse to work\r\n   for those employers who seek to give less than the standard rate of\r\n   wages established by the trade.\r\n\r\n B. _The prohibition of stoppages or deductions of all kinds from\r\n the nominal wages of workmen._ This is principally the object of\r\n the Anti-Truck Society, which seeks to obtain an Act of Parliament,\r\n enjoining the payment in full of all wages. The stoppages or extortions\r\n from workmen’s wages generally consist of:--\r\n\r\n   1. Fines for real or pretended misconduct.\r\n\r\n   2. Rents for tools, frames, gas, and sometimes lodgings.\r\n\r\n   3. Sale of trade appliances (as trimmings, thread, &c.) at undue\r\n   prices.\r\n\r\n   4. Sale of food, drink, &c., at an exorbitant rate of profit.\r\n\r\n   5. Payment in public-houses; as the means of inducing the men to spend\r\n   a portion of their earnings in drink.\r\n\r\n   6. Deposit of money as security before taking out work; so that the\r\n   capital of the employer is increased without payment of interest to\r\n   the workpeople.\r\n\r\n C. _The institution of certain aids or additions to wages_; as--\r\n\r\n   1. Perquisites or gratuities obtained from the public; as with\r\n   waiters, boxkeepers, coachmen, dustmen, vergers, and others.\r\n\r\n   2. Beer money, and other “allowances” to workmen.\r\n\r\n   3. Family work; or the co-operation of the wife and children as a\r\n   means of increasing the workman’s income.\r\n\r\n   4. Allotments of land, to be cultivated after the regular day’s labour.\r\n\r\n   5. The parish “allowance system,” or relief in aid of wages, as\r\n   practised under the old Poor Law.\r\n\r\n D. _The increase of the money value of wages_; by--\r\n\r\n   1. Cheap food.\r\n\r\n   2. Cheap lodgings; through building improved dwellings for the poor,\r\n   and doing away with the profit of sub-letting.\r\n\r\n   3. Co-operative stores; or the “club system” of obtaining provisions\r\n   at wholesale prices.\r\n\r\n   4. The abolition of the payment of wages on Sunday morning, or at so\r\n   late an hour on the Saturday night as to prevent the labourer availing\r\n   himself of the Saturday’s market.\r\n\r\n   5. Teetotalism; as causing the men to spend nothing in fermented\r\n   drinks, and so leaving them more to spend on food.\r\n\r\nSuch are the _direct_ modes of remedying low wages, viz., either by\r\npreventing the price of labour itself falling below a certain standard;\r\nprohibiting all stoppages from the pay of the labourer; instituting\r\ncertain aids or additions to such pay; or increasing the money value of\r\nthe ordinary wages by reducing the price of provisions.\r\n\r\nThe _indirect_ modes of remedying low wages are of a far more complex\r\ncharacter. They consist of, first, the remedies propounded by political\r\neconomists, which are--\r\n\r\n A. _The decrease of the number of labourers_; for gaining this end\r\n several plans have been proposed, as--\r\n\r\n   1. Checks against the increase of the population, for which the\r\n   following are the chief Malthusian proposals:--\r\n\r\n    _a._ Preventive checks for the hindrance of impregnation.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Prohibition of early marriages among the poor.\r\n\r\n    _c._ Increase of the standard of comfort, or requirements, among the\r\n    people; as a means of inducing prudence and restraint of the passions.\r\n\r\n    _d._ Infanticide; as among the Chinese.\r\n\r\n   2. Emigration; as a means of draining off the surplus labourers.\r\n\r\n   3. Limitation of apprentices in skilled trades; as a means of\r\n   preventing the undue increase of particular occupations. This, however,\r\n   is advocated not by economists, but generally by operatives.\r\n\r\n   4. Prevention of family work; or the discouragement of the labour of\r\n   the wives and children of operatives. This, again, cannot be said to be\r\n   an “economist” remedy.\r\n\r\n B. _Increase of the circulating capital, or sum set aside for the\r\n payment of the labourers._\r\n\r\n   1. By government imposts. “Governments,” says Mr. Mill, “can create\r\n   additional industry by creating capital. They may lay on taxes, and\r\n   employ the amount productively.” This was the object of the original\r\n   Poor Law (43 Eliz.), which empowered the overseers of the poor to\r\n   “raise weekly, or otherwise, by taxation of every inhabitant, &c.,\r\n   such sums of money as they shall require for providing a sufficient\r\n   stock of flax, hemp, wool, and other ware or stuff, to set the poor on\r\n   work.”\r\n\r\n   2. By the issue of paper money. The proposition of Mr. Jonathan\r\n   Duncan is, that the government should issue notes equivalent to\r\n   the taxation of the country, with the view of affording increased\r\n   employment to the poor; the people being set to work as it were upon\r\n   credit, in the same manner as the labourers were employed to build the\r\n   market-house at Guernsey.\r\n\r\n C. _The extension of the markets of the country_; by the abolition\r\n of all restrictions on commerce, and the encouragement of the free\r\n interchange of commodities, so that, by increasing the demand for our\r\n products, we may be able to afford employment to an extra number of\r\n producers.\r\n\r\nThe above constitute what, with a few exceptions, may be termed, more\r\nparticularly, the “economist” remedies for low wages.\r\n\r\n D. _The regulation of the quantity of work done by each workman, or\r\n the prevention of the undue economizing of labour._ For this end,\r\n several means have been put forward.\r\n\r\n   1. The shortening the hours of labour, and abolition of Sunday-work.\r\n\r\n   2. Alteration of the mode of work; as the substitution of day-work for\r\n   piece-work, as a means of decreasing the stimulus to overwork.\r\n\r\n   3. Extension of the term of hiring; by the substitution of annual\r\n   engagements for daily or weekly hirings, with a view to the prevention\r\n   of “casual labour.”\r\n\r\n   4. Limitation of the number of hands employed by one capitalist; so as\r\n   to prevent the undue extension of “the large system of production.”\r\n\r\n   5. Taxation of machinery; with the object, not only of making it\r\n   contribute its quota to the revenue of the country, but of impeding\r\n   its undue increase.\r\n\r\n   6. The discountenance of every form of work that tends to the making\r\n   up of a greater quantity of materials with a less quantity of\r\n   labour; and consequently to the expenditure of a greater proportion\r\n   of the capital of the country on machinery or materials, and a\r\n   correspondingly less proportion on the labourers.\r\n\r\n E. _“Protective imposts,” or high import duties on such foreign\r\n commodities as can be produced in this country_; with the view of\r\n preventing the labour of the comparatively untaxed and uncivilized\r\n foreigner being brought into competition with that of the taxed and\r\n civilized producer at home.\r\n\r\n F. _“Financial reform,” or reduction of the taxation of the country_;\r\n as enabling the home labourer the better to compete with the foreigner.\r\n\r\nThe two latter proposals, and that of the extension of the markets, may\r\nbe said to seek to remedy low wages by expanding or circumscribing the\r\nforeign trade of the country.\r\n\r\n G. _A different division of the proceeds of labour._ For this object\r\n several schemes have been propounded:--\r\n\r\n   1. The “tribute system” of wages; or payment of labour according to\r\n   the additional value which it confers on the materials on which it\r\n   operates.\r\n\r\n   2. The abolition of the middleman; whether “sweater,” “piece-master,”\r\n   “lumper,” or what not, coming between the employer and employed.\r\n\r\n   3. Co-operation; or joint-stock associations of labourers, with the\r\n   view of abolishing the profit of the capitalist employer.\r\n\r\n H. _A different mode of distributing the products of labour_; with the\r\n view of abolishing the profit of the dealer, between the producer and\r\n consumer--as co-operative stores, where the consumers club together for\r\n the purchase of their goods directly of the producers.\r\n\r\n I. _A more general and equal division of the wealth of the country_:\r\n for attaining this end there are but two known means:--\r\n\r\n   1. Communism; or the abolition of all rights to individual property.\r\n\r\n   2. Agapism; or the voluntary sharing of individual possessions with\r\n   the less fortunate or successful members of the community.\r\n\r\nThese remedies may, with a few exceptions (such as the tribute system\r\nof wages, and the abolition of middlemen), be said to constitute the\r\nsocialist and communist schemes for the prevention of distress.\r\n\r\n J. _Creating additional employment for the poor_; and so removing the\r\n surplus labour from the market. Two modes of effecting this have been\r\n proposed:--\r\n\r\n   1. Home colonization, or the cultivation of waste lands by the poor.\r\n\r\n   2. Orderlyism, or the employment of the poor in the promotion of\r\n   public cleanliness, and the increased sanitary condition of the\r\n   country.\r\n\r\n K. _The prevention of the enclosure of commons_; as the means of\r\n enabling the poor to obtain gratuitous pasturage for their cattle.\r\n\r\n L. _The abolition of primogeniture_; with the view of dividing the land\r\n among a greater number of individuals.\r\n\r\n M. _The holding of the land by the State_, and equal apportionment of\r\n it among the poor.\r\n\r\n N. _Extension of the suffrage among the people_; and so allowing the\r\n workman, as well as the capitalist and the landlord, to take part in\r\n the formation of the laws of the country. For this purpose there are\r\n two plans:--\r\n\r\n   1. “The freehold-land movement,” which seeks to enable the people to\r\n   become proprietors of as much land as will, under the present law,\r\n   give them “a voice” in the country.\r\n\r\n   2. Chartism, or that which seeks to alter the law concerning the\r\n   election of members of Parliament, and to confer the right of voting\r\n   on every male of mature age, sound mind, and non-criminal character.\r\n\r\n O. _Cultivation of a higher moral and Christian character among the\r\n people._ This form of remedy, which is advocated by many, is based on\r\n the argument, that, without some mitigation of the “selfishness of the\r\n times,” all other schemes for improving the condition of the people\r\n will be either evaded by the cunning of the rich, or defeated by the\r\n servility of the poor.\r\n\r\nThe above I believe to be a full and fair statement of the several\r\nplans that have been proposed, from time to time, for alleviating\r\nthe distress of the people. This enumeration is as comprehensive as\r\nmy knowledge will enable me to make it; and I have abstained from\r\nall comment on the several schemes, so that the reader may have an\r\nopportunity of impartially weighing the merits of each, and adopting\r\nthat, which in his own mind, seems best calculated to effect what,\r\nafter all, we every one desire--whether protectionist, economist,\r\nfree-trader, philanthropist, socialist, communist, or chartist--the\r\ngood of the country in which we live, and the people by whom we are\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow we have to deal here with that particular remedy for low wages or\r\ndistress which consists in creating additional employment for the poor,\r\nand of which the street-orderly system is an example.\r\n\r\nThe increase of employment for the poor was the main object of the\r\n43 Eliz., for which purpose, as we have seen, the overseers of the\r\nseveral parishes were empowered to raise a fund by assessments upon the\r\nproperty of the rich, for providing “a sufficient stock of flax, hemp,\r\nwool, and other ware or stuff, to set the poor on work.” But though\r\neconomists, to this day, tell us that “while, on the one hand, industry\r\nis limited by capital, so, on the other, every increase of capital\r\ngives, or is capable of giving, additional employment to industry, and\r\nthis without assignable limit,”[26] nevertheless the great difficulty\r\nof carrying out the provisions of the original poor-law has consisted\r\nin finding a market for the products of pauper labour, for the frequent\r\ngluts in our manufactures are sufficient to teach us that it is one\r\nthing to produce and another to dispose of the products; so that to\r\ncreate additional employment for the poor something besides capital\r\nis requisite: it is necessary either that they shall be engaged in\r\nproducing that which they themselves immediately consume, or that for\r\nwhich the market admits of being extended.\r\n\r\nThe two plans proposed for the employment of the poor, it will be seen,\r\nconsist (1) in the cultivation of waste lands; (2) in promoting public\r\ncleanliness, and so increasing the sanitary condition of the country.\r\nThe first, it is evident, removes the objection of a market being\r\nneeded for the products of the labour of the poor, since it proposes\r\nthat their energies should be devoted to the production of the food\r\nwhich they themselves consume; while the second seeks to create\r\nadditional employment in effecting that increased cleanliness which\r\nmore enlightened physiological views have not only made more desirable,\r\nbut taught us to be absolutely necessary to the health and enjoyment of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nThe great impediment, however, to the profitable employment of the\r\npoor, has generally been the unproductive or unavailing character\r\nof pauper labour. This has been mainly owing to the fact that the\r\nable-bodied who are deprived of employment are necessarily the lowest\r\ngrade of operatives; for, in the displacement of workmen, those are the\r\nfirst discarded whose labour is found to be the least efficient, either\r\nfrom a deficiency of skill, industry, or sobriety, so that pauper\r\nlabour is necessarily of the least productive character.\r\n\r\nAnother great difficulty with the employment of the poor is, that the\r\nidle, or those to whom work is more than usually irksome, require\r\na stronger inducement than ordinary to make them labour, and the\r\nremuneration for parish work being necessarily less than for any other,\r\nthose who are pauperized through idleness (the most benevolent among\r\nus must allow there are such) are naturally less than ever disposed\r\nto labour when they become paupers. All pauper work, therefore, is\r\ngenerally unproductive or unavailing, because it is either inexpert or\r\nunwilling work. The labour of the in-door paupers, who receive only\r\ntheir food for their pains, is necessarily of the same compulsory\r\ncharacter as slavery; while that of the out-door paupers, with the\r\nremuneration often cut down to the lowest subsisting point, is scarcely\r\nof a more willing or more availing kind.\r\n\r\nOwing to this general unproductiveness, (as well as the difficulty of\r\nfinding a field for the profitable employment of the unemployed poor,)\r\nthe labour of paupers has been for a long time past directed mainly to\r\nthe cleansing of the public thoroughfares. Still, from the degrading\r\nnature of the occupation, and the small remuneration for the toil,\r\npauper labourers have been found to be such unwilling workers that many\r\nparishes have long since given over employing their poor even in this\r\ncapacity, preferring to entrust the work to a contractor, with his paid\r\nself-supporting operatives, instead.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Philanthropic Association appears to have been\r\nfully aware of the two great difficulties besetting the profitable\r\nemployment of the poor, viz., (1) finding a field for the exercise of\r\ntheir labours where they might be “set on work” with benefit to the\r\ncommunity, and without injury to the independent operatives already\r\nengaged in the same occupation; and (2) overcoming the unwillingness,\r\nand consequently the unavailingness, of pauper labour.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty Mr. Cochrane has endeavoured to obviate by taking\r\nadvantage of that growing desire for greater public cleanliness\r\nwhich has arisen from the increased knowledge of the principles\r\ngoverning the health of towns; and the second, by giving the men\r\n12_s._ instead of 9_s._ or 7_s._ a week, or worse than all, 1_s._\r\n1-1/2_d._ and a quartern loaf a day for three days in the week,\r\nand so not only augmenting the stimulus to work (for it should be\r\nremembered that wages are to the human machine what the fire is to the\r\nsteam-engine), but preventing the undue depreciation of the labour\r\nof the independent workman. He who discovers the means of increasing\r\nthe rewards of labour, is as great a friend to his race as he who\r\nstrives to depreciate them is the public enemy; and I do not hesitate\r\nto confess, that I look upon Mr. Charles Cochrane as one of the\r\nillustrious few who, in these days of unremunerated toil, and their\r\nnecessary concomitants--beggars and thieves, has come forward to help\r\nthe labourers of this country from their daily-increasing degradation.\r\nHis benevolence is of that enlightened order which seeks to extend\r\nrather than destroy the self-trust of the poor, not only by creating\r\nadditional employment for them, but by rendering that employment less\r\nrepulsive.\r\n\r\nThe means by which Mr. Cochrane has endeavoured to gain these ends\r\nconstitutes the system called Street-Orderlyism, which therefore admits\r\nof being viewed in two distinct aspects--first, as a new mode of\r\nimproving “the health of towns,” and, secondly, as an improved method\r\nof employing the poor.\r\n\r\nConcerning the first, I must confess that the system of scavaging or\r\ncleansing the public thoroughfares pursued by the street-orderlies\r\nassumes, when contemplated in a sanitary point of view, all the\r\nimportance and simplicity of a great discovery. It has been before\r\npointed out that this system consists not only in cleansing the\r\nstreets, but in _keeping_ them clean. By the street-orderly method\r\nof scavaging, the thoroughfares are continually being cleansed, and\r\nso never allowed to become dirty; whereas, by the ordinary method,\r\nthey are not cleansed _until_ they are dirty. Hence the two modes of\r\nscavaging are diametrically opposed; under the one the streets are\r\ncleansed as fast as dirtied, while under the other they are dirtied as\r\nfast as cleansed; so that by the new system of scavaging the public\r\nthoroughfares are maintained in a perpetual state of cleanliness,\r\nwhereas by the old they may be said to be kept in a continual state of\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\nThe street-orderly system of scavaging, however, is not only worthy of\r\nhigh commendation as a more efficient means of gaining a particular\r\nend--a simplification of a certain process--but it calls for our\r\nhighest praise as well for the end gained as for the means of gaining\r\nit. If it be really a sound physiological principle, that the Creator\r\nhas made dirt offensive to every rightly-constituted mind, because it\r\nis injurious to us, and so established in us an instinct, before we\r\ncould discover a reason, for removing all refuse from our presence,\r\nit becomes, now that we have detected the cause of the feeling in us,\r\nat once disgusting and irrational to allow the filth to accumulate\r\nin our streets in front of our houses. If typhus, cholera, and other\r\npestilences are but divine punishments inflicted on us for the\r\ninfraction of that most kindly law by which the health of a people has\r\nbeen made to depend on that which is naturally agreeable--cleanliness,\r\nthen our instinct for self-preservation should force us, even if our\r\nsense of enjoyment would not lead us, to remove as fast as it is formed\r\nwhat is at once as dangerous as it should be repulsive to our natures.\r\nSanitarily regarded, the cleansing of a town is one of the most\r\nimportant objects that can engage the attention of its governors; the\r\nremoval of its refuse being quite as necessary for the continuance of\r\nthe existence of a people as the supply of their food. In the economy\r\nof Nature there is no loss: this the great doctrine of waste and supply\r\nhas taught us; the detritus of one rock is the conglomerate of another;\r\nthe evaporation of the ocean is the source of the river; the poisonous\r\nexhalations of animals the vital air of plants; and the refuse of man\r\nand beasts the food of their food. The dust and cinders from our fires,\r\nthe “slops” from the washing of our houses, the excretions of our\r\nbodies, the detritus and “surface-water” of our streets, have all their\r\noffices to perform in the great scheme of creation; and if left to rot\r\nand fust about us not only injure our health, but diminish the supplies\r\nof our food. The filth of the thoroughfares of the metropolis forms, it\r\nwould appear, the staple manure of the market-gardens in the suburbs;\r\nout of the London mud come the London cabbages: so that an improvement\r\nin the scavaging of the metropolis tends not only to give the people\r\nimproved health, but improved vegetables; for that which is nothing\r\nbut a pestiferous muck-heap in the town becomes a vivifying garden\r\ntranslated to the country.\r\n\r\nDirt, however, is not only as prejudicial to our health and offensive\r\nto our senses, when allowed to accumulate in our streets, as it is\r\nbeneficial to us when removed to our gardens,--but it is a most\r\nexpensive commodity to keep in front of our houses. It has been shown,\r\nthat the cost to the people of London, in the matter of extra washing\r\ninduced by defective scavaging, is at the least 1,000,000_l._ sterling\r\nper annum (the Board of Health estimate it at 2,500,000_l._); and the\r\nloss from extra wear and tear of clothes from brushing and scrubbing,\r\narising from the like cause, is about the same prodigious sum; while\r\nthe injury done to the furniture of private houses, and the goods\r\nexposed for sale in shops, though impossible to be estimated--appears\r\nto be something enormous: so that the loss from the defective scavaging\r\nof the metropolis seems, at the lowest calculation, to amount to\r\nseveral millions per annum; and hence it becomes of the highest\r\npossible importance, economically as well as physiologically, that the\r\nstreets should be cleansed in the most effective manner.\r\n\r\nNow, that the street-orderly system is the only rational and\r\nefficacious mode of street cleansing both theory and practice assure\r\nus. To allow the filth to accumulate in the streets before any steps\r\nare taken to remove it, is the same as if we were never to wash our\r\nbodies until they were dirty--it is to be perpetually striving to cure\r\nthe disease, when with scarcely any more trouble we might prevent\r\nit entirely. There is, indeed, the same difference between the new\r\nand the old system of scavaging, as there is between a bad and a good\r\nhousewife: the one never cleaning her house until it is dirty, and the\r\nother continually cleaning it, so as to prevent it being ever dirty.\r\n\r\nHence it would appear, that the street-orderly system of scavaging\r\nwould be a great public benefit, even were there no other object\r\nconnected with it than the increased cleanliness of our streets; but\r\nin a country like Great Britain, afflicted as it is with a surplus\r\npopulation (no matter from what cause), that each day finds the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining work growing greater, the opening up of new\r\nfields of employment for the poor is perhaps the greatest benefit that\r\ncan be conferred upon the nation. Without the discovery of such new\r\nfields, “the setting the poor on work” is merely, as I have said, to\r\nthrow out of employment those who are already employed; it is not to\r\ndecrease, but really to increase, the evil of the times--to add to,\r\nrather than diminish, the number of our paupers or our thieves. The\r\nincrease of employment in a nation, however, requires, not only a\r\ncorresponding increase of capital, but a like increase in the demand\r\nor desire, as well as in the pecuniary means, of the people to avail\r\nthemselves of the work on which the poor are set (that is to say, in\r\nthe extension of the home market); it requires, also, some mode of\r\nstimulating the energies of the workers, so as to make them labour\r\nmore willingly, and consequently more availingly, than usual. These\r\nconditions appear to have been fulfilled by Mr. Cochrane, in the\r\nestablishment of the street-orderlies. He has introduced, in connection\r\nwith this body, a system of scavaging which, while it employs a greater\r\nnumber of hands, produces such additional benefits as cannot but be\r\nconsidered an equivalent for the increased expenditure; though it is\r\neven doubtful whether, by the collection of the street manure unmixed\r\nwith the mud, the extra value of that article alone will not go far to\r\ncompensate for the additional expense; if, however, there be added to\r\nthis the saving to the metropolitan parishes in the cost of watering\r\nthe streets--for under the street-orderly system this is not required,\r\nthe dust never being allowed to accumulate, and consequently never\r\nrequiring to be “laid”--as well as the greater saving of converting the\r\npaupers into self-supporting labourers; together with the diminished\r\nexpense of washing and doctors’ bills, consequent on the increased\r\ncleanliness of the streets--there cannot be the least doubt that the\r\nemployment of the poor as street-orderlies is no longer a matter of\r\nphilanthropy, but of mere commercial prudence.\r\n\r\nSuch appear to me to be the principal objects of Mr. Cochrane’s\r\nstreet-orderly system of scavaging; and it is a subject upon which I\r\nhave spoken the more freely, because, being unacquainted with that\r\ngentleman, none can suspect me of being prejudiced in his favour, and\r\nbecause I have felt that the good which he has done and is likely to do\r\nto the poor, has been comparatively unacknowledged by the public, and\r\nthat society and the people owe him a heavy debt of gratitude[27].\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to set forth the character of the labour, and the\r\ncondition and remuneration of the labourers in connection with the\r\nstreet-orderly system of scavaging the metropolitan thoroughfares.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of the street-orderlies in the metropolis was in\r\n1843. Mr. Charles Cochrane, who had previously formed the National\r\nPhilanthropic Association, with its eleemosynary soup-kitchens, &c.,\r\nthen introduced the system of street-orderlies, as one enabling many\r\ndestitute men to support themselves by their labour; as well as, in\r\nhis estimation, a better, and eventually a more economical, mode of\r\nstreet-cleansing, and partaking also somewhat of the character of a\r\nstreet police.\r\n\r\nThe first “demonstration,” or display of the street-orderly\r\nsystem, took place in Regent-street, between the Quadrant and\r\nthe Regent-circus, and in Oxford-street, between Vere-street and\r\nCharles-street. The streets were thoroughly swept in the morning, and\r\nthen each man or boy, provided with a hand-broom and dust-pan, removed\r\nany dirt as soon as it was deposited. The demonstration was pronounced\r\nhighly successful and the system effective, in the opinion of eighteen\r\ninfluential inhabitants of the locality who acted as a committee, and\r\nwho publicly, and with the authority of their names, testified their\r\nconviction that “the most efficient means of keeping streets clean, and\r\nmore especially great thoroughfares, was to prevent the accumulation\r\nof dirt, by removing the manure within a few minutes after it has been\r\ndeposited by the passing cattle; the same having, hitherto, remained\r\nduring several days.”\r\n\r\nThe cost of this demonstration amounted to about 400_l._, of which,\r\nthe Report states, “200_l._ still remains due from the shop-keepers to\r\nthe Association; which,” it is delicately added, “from late commercial\r\ndifficulties they have not yet repaid” (in 1850).\r\n\r\nWhilst the street-orderlies were engaged in cleansing Regent-street,\r\n&c., the City Commissioners of the sewers of London were invited to\r\ndepute some person to observe and report to them concerning the method\r\npursued; but with that instinctive sort of repugnance which seems to\r\nanimate the great bulk of city officials against improvement of any\r\nkind, the reply was, that they “did not consider the same worthy their\r\nattention.” The matter, however, was not allowed to drop, and by the\r\npersevering efforts of Mr. Cochrane, the president, and of the body of\r\ngentlemen who form the Council of the Association, Cheapside, Cornhill,\r\nand the most important parts of the very heart of the city were at\r\nlength cleansed according to the new method. The ratepayers then showed\r\nthat _they_, at least, _did_ consider “the same worthy of attention,”\r\nfor 8000 out of 12,000 within a few days signed memorials recommending\r\nthe adoption of what they pronounced an improvement, and a public\r\nmeeting was held in Guildhall (May 4, 1846), at which resolutions in\r\nfavour of the street-orderly method were passed. The authorities did\r\nnot adopt these recommendations, but they ventured so far to depart\r\nfrom their venerable routine as to order the streets to be “swept every\r\nday!” This employed upwards of 300 men, whereas at the period when the\r\nsages of the city sewers did not consider any proposed improvement in\r\nscavagery worthy their attention, the number of men employed by them in\r\ncleansing the streets did not exceed 30.\r\n\r\nThe street-orderly system was afterwards tried in the parishes of St.\r\nPaul, Covent-garden, St. James (Westminster), St. Martin-in-the-Fields,\r\nSt. Anne, Soho, and others--sometimes calling forth opposition, of\r\ncourse from the authorities connected with the established modes of\r\npaving, scavaging, &c.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to write a complete history of the\r\nstreet-orderlies, but merely to sketch their progress, as well as\r\ndescribe their peculiar characteristics.\r\n\r\nWithin these few months public meetings have been held in almost every\r\none of the 26 wards of the City, at which approving resolutions were\r\neither passed unanimously or carried by large majorities; and the\r\nstreet-orderly system is now about to be introduced into St. Martin’s\r\nparish instead of the street-sweeping machine.\r\n\r\nAs far as the street-orderly system has been tried, and judging only by\r\nthe testimony of public examination and public record of opinion, the\r\ntrial has certainly been a success. A memorial to the Court of Sewers,\r\nfrom the ward of Broad-street, supported by the leading merchants of\r\nthat locality, in recommendation of the employment of street-orderlies,\r\nseems to bear more closely on the subject than any I have yet seen.\r\n\r\n“Your memorialists,” they state, “have observed that those public\r\nthoroughfares within the city of London which are now cleansed by\r\nstreet-orderlies, _are so remarkably clean_ as to be _almost free from\r\nmud in wet, and dust in dry weather_--that _such extreme cleanliness\r\nis of great comfort to the public_, and tends to improve the sanitary\r\ncondition of the ward.”\r\n\r\nBut it is not only in the metropolis that the street-orderlies seem\r\nlikely to become the established scavagers. The streets of Windsor, I\r\nam informed, are now in the course of being cleansed upon the orderly\r\nplan. In Amsterdam, there are at present 16 orderlies regularly\r\nemployed upon scavaging a portion of the city, and in Paris and\r\nBelgium, I am assured, arrangements are being made for the introduction\r\nof the system into both those cities. Were the street-orderly mode of\r\nscavaging to become general throughout this country, it is estimated\r\nthat employment would be given to 100,000 labourers, so that, with the\r\nfamilies of these men, not less than half a million of people would be\r\nsupported in a state of independence by it. The total number of adult\r\nable-bodied paupers relieved--in-door and out-door--throughout England\r\nand Wales, on January 1, 1850, was 154,525.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the route of the street-orderly operations in\r\nthe metropolis. A further column, in the Report from which the table\r\nhas been extracted, contained the names of thirteen clergymen who have\r\n“weekly read prayers and delivered discourses to the street-orderlies\r\nat their respective stations, and recorded flattering testimonials of\r\ntheir conduct and demeanour.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPLOYMENT OF STREET-ORDERLIES.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------+------------+-----------+-----------------\r\n                                                     |   No. of   | Wives and |\r\n                  LOCALITIES CLEANSED.               |   Street-  |  Children |     Money\r\n                                                     | Orderlies. | dependent.|   expended.\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------+------------+-----------+-----------------\r\n                                                     |            |           |   £   _s._  _d._\r\n  1843-4.

Thus are the streets under their care kept constantly clean.\r\n\r\n“But sweeping and removing dirt,” continues the Report, “is not the\r\nonly occupation of the street-orderly, whilst keeping up a careful\r\ninspection of the ground allotted to him. He is also the watchman\r\nof house-property and shop-goods; the guardian of reticules,\r\npocket-books, purses, and watch-pockets;--the experienced observer\r\nand detector of pickpockets; the ever ready, though unpaid, auxiliary\r\nto the police constable. Nay, more;--he is always at hand, to render\r\nassistance to both equestrian and pedestrian: if a horse slip,\r\nstumble, or fall,--if a carriage break down, or vehicles come into\r\ncollision,--the street-orderly darts forward to raise and rectify\r\nthem: if foot-passengers be run over, or knocked down, or incautiously\r\nloiter on a crossing, the street-orderly rescues them from peril or\r\ndeath; or warns them of the approaching danger of carriages driving in\r\nopposite directions: if other accidents befall pedestrians,--if they\r\nfall on the pavement, from sudden illness, faintness, or apoplexy,\r\nthe street-orderly is at hand to render assistance, or convey them\r\nto the nearest surgery or hospital. If strangers are at fault as to\r\nthe localities of London, or the place of their destination, the\r\norderly, in a civil and respectful manner, directs them on their way.\r\nIf habitual or professional mendicants are importunate or troublesome,\r\nthe street-orderly warns them off; or hands them to the care of\r\nthe policeman. And if a _really_ poor or starving fellow-creature\r\nwanders in search of food or alms, he leads him to a workhouse or\r\nsoup-kitchen[28].\r\n\r\n“_Should the system become general (of which there is now every\r\ngood prospect), it will be the means of rescuing no less than_ TEN\r\nTHOUSAND PERSONS _and their families from destitution and distress_\r\n(in London alone);--from the forlorn and wretched condition which\r\ntempts to criminality and outrage, to that of comfort, independence,\r\nand happiness--produced by their own industry, aided by the kind\r\nconsideration of those who are more the favourites of fortune than\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“In conclusion it may be stated, that the street-orderly system will\r\nkeep the streets and pavements of London and Westminster as clean\r\nas the court-yard and hall of any gentleman’s private dwelling: it\r\nwill not only secure the general comfort and health of upwards of two\r\nmillions of people, but save a vast annual amount to shopkeepers,\r\nhousekeepers, and others, with regard to the spoiling of their goods\r\nby dust and dirt; in the wear and tear of clothes and furniture, by an\r\neternal round of brushing, dusting, scouring, and scrubbing.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing extract fully indicates the system pursued and results\r\nof street-orderlyism. I will now deal with what may be considered _the\r\nlabour or trade part of the question_.\r\n\r\nBy the street-orderly plan a district is duly apportioned. To one\r\nman is assigned the care of a series of courts, a street, or 500,\r\n1000, 1200, 1500, or 2000 yards of a public way, according to its\r\ntraffic, after the whole surface has been swept “the first thing in the\r\nmorning.” In Oxford-street, for instance, it has been estimated that\r\n500 yards can be kept clear of the dirt continually being deposited by\r\none man; in the squares, where there is no great traffic, 2000 yards;\r\nwhile in so busy a part as Cheapside, some nine men will be required to\r\nbe hourly on the look-out. These street-orderlies are confined to their\r\nbeats as strictly as are policeman, and as they soon become known to\r\nthe inhabitants, it is a means of checking any disposition to loiter,\r\nor to shirk the work; to say nothing of the corps of inspectors and\r\nsuperintendents.\r\n\r\nThe _division of labour_ among the street-orderlies is as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The _foreman_, whose duty is to “look over the men” (one such\r\nover-looker being employed to about every 20 men), and who receives\r\n15_s._ per week.\r\n\r\n2. The _barrow-men_, or sweepers, consisting of men and boys; the\r\nformer receiving 12_s._ and the latter generally 7_s._ per week.\r\n\r\nThe _tools and implements_ used, and their cost, are as\r\nfollows:--wooden scoops, to throw up the slop, 1_s._ 2_d._ each (they\r\nused to be made of iron, weighing 8 lbs. each, but the men then\r\ncomplained that the weight “broke their arms”); shovel, 2_s._ 3_d._;\r\nhoe and scraper, 1_s._ 3_d._; hand-broom, 8_d._; scavager’s broom,\r\n1_s._ 2_d._; barrow, 12_s._; covered barrow, 24_s._\r\n\r\nIn the amount of his receipts, the street-orderly appears to a\r\ndisadvantage, as many of the “regular hands” of the contractors receive\r\n16_s._ weekly, and he but 12_s._ The reason for this circumscribed\r\npayment I have already alluded to--the deficiency of funds to carry out\r\nthe full purposes of the Association. Contrasted with the remuneration\r\nof the great majority of the pauper scavagers, the street-orderly is\r\nin a state of comparative comfort, for he receives nearly double as\r\nmuch as the Guardians of the Poor of Chelsea and the Liberty of the\r\nRolls pay their labourers, and full 25 per cent. more than is paid\r\nby Bermondsey, Deptford, Marylebone, St. James’s, Westminster, St.\r\nGeorge’s, Hanover-square, and St. Andrew’s, Holborn; and, I am assured,\r\nit is the intention of the Council to pay the full rate of wages given\r\nby the more respectable scavagers, viz., 16_s._ a week each man. _If\r\ntraders can do this, philanthropists, who require no profit, at least\r\nshould be equally liberal._ The labourer never can be benefited by\r\ndepreciating the ordinary wages of his trade; and I must in justice\r\nconfess, that there are scattered throughout the Report repeated\r\nregrets that the funds of the Association will not admit of a higher\r\nrate of wages being paid.\r\n\r\nThe street-orderly is not subjected to any fines or drawbacks, and\r\nis paid always in money, every Saturday evening at the office of the\r\nAssociation. In this respect, however, he does not differ from other\r\nbodies of scavagers.\r\n\r\nThe usual mode of obtaining employment among the street-orderlies\r\nis by personal application at the office of the Association in\r\nLeicester-square; but sometimes letters, well-penned and well-worded,\r\nare addressed to the president.\r\n\r\nThe daily number of applicants for employment is far from demonstrative\r\nof that unbroken prosperity of the country, of which we hear so much.\r\nOn my inquiring into the number, I ascertained towards the end of\r\nAugust, that, for the previous fortnight, during fine summer weather,\r\nLondon being still full of the visitors to the Exhibition, on an\r\naverage 30 men, of nearly all conditions of life, applied personally\r\neach day for work at street-sweeping, at 12_s._ a week. Certainly\r\nthis labour is not connected with the feeling of pauper degradation,\r\nbut it does not look well for the country that in twelve days 360\r\nmen should apply for such work. On the year’s average, I am assured,\r\nthere are 30 applications daily, but only ten new applicants, as men\r\ncall to solicit an engagement again and again. Thus in the year there\r\nare _nine thousand, three hundred, and ninety_ applications, and 3130\r\nindividual applicants. In the course of one month last winter, there\r\nwere applications from 300 boys in Spitalfields alone, to be set to\r\nwork; and I am told, that had they been successful, 3000 lads would\r\nhave applied the next month.\r\n\r\nWhen an application is made by any one recommended by subscribers, &c.,\r\nto the Association, or where the case seems worthy of attention, the\r\nnames and addresses are entered in a book, with a slight sketch of the\r\ncircumstances of the person wishing to become a street-orderly, so that\r\ninquiries may be made. I give a few of the more recent of these entries\r\nand descriptions, which are really “histories in little”:--\r\n\r\n“Thomas M’G----, aged 50, W-- L-- street, Chelsea Hospital, single man.\r\nTaught a French and English school in Lyons, France. Driven out of\r\nFrance at the Revolution of 1848. Penniless.\r\n\r\n“Rich. M----, 13, C---- street, H---- garden, 42 years. Married. Can\r\nread and write. Has been a seaman in the royal service ten years.\r\nChairmaker by trade. Has jobbed as a porter in Rochester, Kent.\r\n\r\n“Phil. S----, 1, R-- L-- street, High Holborn. From Killarney, co.\r\nKerry. Bred a gardener. Fifteen years in constabulary force, for which\r\nhe has a character from Col. Macgregor, and received the compensation\r\nof 50_l._, which he bestowed on his father and mother to keep them at\r\nhome. Nine months in England, viz., in Bristol, Bath, and London. Aged\r\n35. Can read and write.\r\n\r\n“Edw. C----, 79, M---- street, Hackney. Aged 27. Married.\r\nArmy-pensioner, 6_d._ a day. Can read and write. Recommended by Rev. T.\r\nGibson, rector of Hackney.\r\n\r\n“Chas. J----, 11, D---- street, Chelsea. Aged 38. Gentleman’s servant.”\r\n\r\nIn my account of the “regular hands” employed by the contracting\r\nscavagers, I have stated that the street-orderlies were a more\r\nmiscellaneous body, as they had not been reared in the same proportion\r\nto street work. They are also, I may add, a better-conducted and\r\nbetter-informed class than the general run of unskilled labourers, as\r\nthey know, before applying for street-orderly work, that inquiries are\r\nmade concerning them, and that men of reprobate character will not be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nMany of those employed as orderlies have since returned to their\r\noriginal employments; others have procured, and been recommended to,\r\nsuperior situations in life to that of street-orderlies, by the Council\r\nof the Association, but _no instance has occurred of any street-orderly\r\nhaving returned back to his parish workhouse or stoneyard_. This\r\ncertainly looks well.\r\n\r\nOne street-orderly, I may add, is now a reputable school-master,\r\nand has been so for some time; another is a clerk under similar\r\ncircumstances. Another is a good theoretical and practical musician,\r\nhaving officiated as organist in churches and at concerts; he is also a\r\nneat music copyist. Another tells of his correspondence with a bishop\r\non theological topics. Another, with a long and well-cultured beard,\r\nhas been a model for artists. One had 150_l._ left to him not long\r\nago, which was soon spent; his wife spent it, he said, and then he\r\nquietly applied to be permitted to be again a street-orderly. Several\r\nhave got engagements as seamen, their original calling--indeed, I am\r\nassured, that a few months of street-orderly labour is looked upon as\r\nan excellent ordeal of character, after which the Association affirms\r\ngood behaviour on the part of the employed.\r\n\r\nThe subscribers to the funds not unfrequently recommend destitute\r\npersons to the good offices of the Association, apart from their\r\nemployment as street-orderlies. Thus, it is only a few weeks ago,\r\nthat twelve Spanish refugees, none of them speaking English, were\r\nrecommended to the Association; one of them it was ultimately enabled\r\nto establish as a waiter in an hotel resorted to by foreigners, another\r\nas an interpreter, another as a gentleman’s servant, and another (with\r\na little boy, his son) in shoe-blacking in Leicester-square.\r\n\r\nThus among street-orderlies are to be found a great diversity of career\r\nin life, and what may be called adventures.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage, however, which the orderly possesses over his\r\nbetter paid brethren is in the greater probability of his “rising out\r\nof the street.” This is very rarely the case with an ordinary scavager.\r\n\r\nI now give the following account from one of the street-orderlies, a\r\ntall, soldierly-looking man:--\r\n\r\n“I’m 42 now,” he said, “and when I was a boy and a young man I was\r\nemployed in the _Times_ machine office, but got into a bit of a row--a\r\nbit of a street quarrel and frolic, and was called on to pay 3_l._,\r\nsomething about a street-lamp: that was out of the question; and\r\nas I was taking a walk in the park, not just knowing what I’d best\r\ndo, I met a recruiting sergeant, and enlisted on a sudden--all on a\r\nsudden--in the 16th Lancers. When I came to the standard, though, I was\r\nfound a little bit too short. Well, I was rather frolicsome in those\r\ndays, I confess, and perhaps _had rather a turn for a roving life_,\r\nso when the sergeant said he’d take me to the East India Company’s\r\nrecruiting sergeant, I consented, and was accepted at once. I was\r\ntaken to Calcutta, and served under General Nott all through the\r\nAffghan war. I was in the East India Company’s artillery, 4th company\r\nand 2nd battalion. Why, yes, sir, I saw a little of what you may call\r\n‘service.’ I was at the fighting at Candahar, Bowlinglen, Bowling-pass,\r\nClatigillsy, Ghuznee, and Caboul. The first real warm work I was in\r\nwas at Candahar. I’ve heard young soldiers say that they’ve gone into\r\naction the first time as merry as they would go to a play. Don’t\r\nbelieve them, sir. Old soldiers will tell you quite different. You\r\n_must_ feel queer and serious the first time you’re in action: it’s\r\nnot fear--it’s nervousness. The crack of the muskets at the first fire\r\nyou hear in real hard earnest is uncommon startling; you see the flash\r\nof the fire from the enemy’s line, but very little else. Indeed, oft\r\nenough you see nothing but smoke, and hear nothing but balls whistling\r\nevery side of you. And then you get excited, just as if you were at\r\na hunt; but after a little service--I can speak for myself, at any\r\nrate--you go into action as you go to your dinner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ABLE-BODIED PAUPER STREET-SWEEPER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\n“I served during the time when there was the Affghanistan retreat;\r\nwhen the 44th was completely cut up, before any help could get up to\r\nthem. We suffered a good deal from want of sufficient food; but it\r\nwas nothing like so bad, at the very worst, as if you’re suffering in\r\nLondon. In India, in that war time, if you suffered, you were along\r\nwith a number in just the same boat as yourself; and there’s always\r\nsomething to hope for when you’re an army. It’s different if you’re\r\nwalking the streets of London by yourself--I felt it, sir, for a little\r\nbit after my return--and if you haven’t a penny, you feel as if there\r\nwasn’t a hope. If you have friends it may be different, but I had none.\r\nIt’s no comfort if you know hundreds are suffering as you are, for\r\nyou can’t help and cheer one another as soldiers can.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, as I’ve told you, I saw a good deal of service all through\r\nthat war. Indeed I served thirteen years and four months, and was then\r\ndischarged on account of ill health. If I’d served eight months longer\r\nthat would have been fourteen years, and I should have been entitled\r\nto a pension. I believe my illness was caused by the hardships I went\r\nthrough in the campaigns, fighting and killing men that I never saw\r\nbefore, and until I was in India had never heard of, and that I had no\r\nill-will to; certainly not, why should I? they never did me any wrong.\r\nBut when it comes to war, if you can’t kill them they’ll kill you. When\r\nI got back to London I applied at the East India House for a pension,\r\nbut was refused. I hadn’t served my time, though that wasn’t my fault.\r\n\r\n“I then applied for work in the _Times_ machine office, and they\r\nwere kind enough to put me on. But I wasn’t master of the work, for\r\nthere was new machinery, wonderful machinery, and a many changes. So\r\nI couldn’t be kept on, and was some time out of work, and very badly\r\noff, as I’ve said before, and then I got work as a scavenger. O, I knew\r\nnothing about sweeping before that. I’d never swept anything except\r\nthe snow in the north of India, which is quite a different sort of\r\nthing to London dirt. But I very soon got into the way of it. I found\r\nno difficulty about it, though some may pretend there is an art in it.\r\nI had 15_s._ a week, and when I was no longer wanted I got employment\r\nas a street-orderly. I never was married, and have only myself to\r\nprovide for. I’m satisfied that the street-orderly is far the best\r\nplan for street-cleaning. Nothing else can touch it, in my opinion,\r\nand I thought so before I was one of them, and I believe most working\r\nscavengers think so now, though they mayn’t like to say so, for fear it\r\nmight go again their interest.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I’m sometimes questioned by gentlemen that may be passing in\r\nthe streets while I’m at work, all about our system. They generally\r\nsay, ‘and a very good system, too.’ One said once, ‘It shows that\r\nscavengers can be decent men; they weren’t when I was first in London,\r\nabove 40 years ago.’ Well, I sometimes get the price of a pint of beer\r\ngiven to me by gentlemen making inquiries, but very seldom.”\r\n\r\nUntil about eighteen months ago none but unmarried men were employed\r\nby the Association, and these all resided in one locality, and under\r\none general superintendence or system. The boarding and lodging of the\r\nmen has, however, been discontinued about fifteen months; for I am\r\ntold it was found difficult to encourage industrial and self-reliant\r\npursuits in connection with public eleemosynary aid. Married men are\r\nnow employed, and all the street-orderlies reside at their own homes;\r\nthe adults, married or single, receiving 12_s._ a week each; the boys,\r\n6_s._; while to each man is gratuitously supplied a blouse of blue\r\nserge, costing 2_s._ 6_d._, and a glazed hat, costing the same amount.\r\n\r\nThe system formerly adopted was as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe men were formed into a distinct body, and established in houses\r\ntaken for them in Ham-yard, Great Windmill-street, Haymarket.\r\n\r\n“The wages of the men,” states the Report, “were fixed at 12_s._ each\r\nper week; that is, 9_s._ were charged for board and lodging, and 3_s._\r\nwere paid in money to each man on Saturday afternoon, out of which he\r\nwas expected to pay for his clothing and washing. The men had provided\r\nfor them clean wholesome beds and bedding, a common sitting-room, with\r\nevery means of ablution and personal cleanliness, including a warm\r\nbath once a week. Their food was abundant and of the best quality,\r\nviz., coffee and bread and butter for breakfast, at eight o’clock;\r\nround of beef, bread, and vegetables, four times a week for dinner, at\r\none o’clock; nutritious soup and bread, or bread and cheese, forming\r\nthe afternoon repast of the other three days. At six in the evening,\r\nwhen they returned from their labours, they were refreshed with tea or\r\ncoffee, and bread and butter; or for supper, at nine, each had a large\r\nbasin of soup, with bread. Thus, three-fourths of their wages being\r\nlaid out for them to advantage, the men were well lodged and fed; and\r\nthey have always declared themselves satisfied, comfortable, and happy,\r\nunder the arrangements that were made for them. Under the charge of\r\ntheir intelligent and active superintendent, the street-orderlies soon\r\nfell into a state of the most exact discipline and order; and when\r\nold orderlies were drafted off, either to enter the service of parish\r\nboards who adopted the system, or were recommended into service, or\r\nsome other superior position in life, and when new recruits came to\r\nsupply their places, the latter found no difficulty in conforming to\r\nthe rules laid down for the performance of their duties, as well as for\r\ntheir general conduct. ‘Military time’ regulated their hours of labour,\r\nrefreshment, and rest; due attention was required from all; and each\r\nman (though a scavenger) was expected to be cleanly in his person, and\r\nrespectful in his demeanour; indeed, nothing could be more gratifying\r\nthan the conduct of these men, both at home and abroad.”\r\n\r\n“In their domicile in Ham Yard,” continues the Report, “the\r\nstreet-orderlies have invariably been encouraged to follow pursuits\r\nwhich were useful and improving, after their daily labours were at\r\nan end; for this, a small library of history, voyages, travels, and\r\ninstructive and entertaining periodical works, was placed at their\r\ndisposal; and it is truly gratifying to the Council to be able to\r\nstate, that the men evinced great satisfaction, and even avidity,\r\nin availing themselves of this source of intellectual pleasure and\r\nimprovement. Writing materials also were provided for them, for the\r\npurpose of practice and improvement, as well as for mutual instruction\r\nin this most necessary and useful art; and it must be gratifying to\r\nthe members of the Association to be informed, that, in April last, 34\r\nout of 40 men appended their signatures, distinctly and well written,\r\nto a document which was submitted to them. Such a fact will at least\r\nprove, that when poor persons are employed, well fed, and lodged, and\r\ncared for in the way of instruction, they do not always mis-spend their\r\ntime, nor, from mere preference, run riot in pot-houses and scenes of\r\nlow debauchery. It is to be borne in mind, however, that one-half of\r\nthese men were persons of almost every trade and occupation, from the\r\nartizan to the shopman and clerk, and therefore previously educated;\r\nthe other half consisted of labourers and persons forsaken and indigent\r\nfrom their birth, and formerly dependent on workhouse charity or chance\r\nemployment for their scanty subsistence; consequently in a state of\r\nutter ignorance as to reading and writing.\r\n\r\n“Every night, after supper, prayers were read by the superintendent;\r\nand it has frequently been a most edifying as well as gratifying sight\r\nto members of your Council, as well as to other persons of rank and\r\nstation in society, who have visited the Hospice in Ham Yard at that\r\ninteresting hour, to observe the decorum with which these poor men\r\ndemeaned themselves; and the heartfelt solemnity with which they joined\r\nin the invocations and thanks to their Creator and Preserver!\r\n\r\n“Each Sunday morning, at 8 o’clock, a portion of the church service\r\nwas read, followed by an extemporaneous discourse or exhortation by\r\nthe secretary to the Hospice. They were marshalled to church twice on\r\nthe Sabbath, headed by the superintendent and foremen; and generally\r\ndivided into two or three bodies, each taking a direction to St.\r\nJames’s, St. Anne’s, or St. Paul’s, Covent Garden; in all of which\r\nplaces of worship they had sitting accommodation provided by the\r\nkindness of the clergy and churchwardens. On Tuesday evenings they had\r\nthe benefit of receiving pastoral visits and instruction from several\r\nof the worthy clergymen of the surrounding parishes.”\r\n\r\nThis is all very benevolent, but still very wrong. There is but one\r\nway of benefiting the poor, viz., by developing their powers of\r\nself-reliance, and certainly not in treating them like children.\r\nPhilanthropists always seek to do too much, and in this is to be found\r\nthe main cause of their repeated failures. The poor are expected to\r\nbecome angels in an instant, and the consequence is, they are merely\r\nmade _hypocrites_. Moreover, no men of any independence of character\r\nwill submit to be washed, and dressed, and fed like schoolboys;\r\nhence none but the worst classes come to be experimented upon. It\r\nwould seem, too, that this overweening disposition to play the part\r\nof _ped-agogues_ (I use the word in its literal sense) to the poor,\r\nproceeds rather from a love of power than from a sincere regard for the\r\npeople. Let the rich become the advisers and assistants of the poor,\r\ngiving them the benefit of their superior education and means--but\r\n_leaving the people to act for themselves_--and they will do a great\r\ngood, developing in them a higher standard of comfort and moral\r\nexcellence, and so, by improving their tastes, inducing a necessary\r\nchange in their habits. But such as seek merely to _lord it_ over those\r\nwhom distress has placed in their power, and strive to bring about\r\nthe _villeinage_ of benevolence, making the people the philanthropic,\r\ninstead of the feudal, serfs of our nobles, should be denounced as the\r\narch-enemies of the country. Such persons may mean well, but assuredly\r\nthey achieve the worst towards the poor. The curfew-bell, whether\r\ninstituted by benevolence or tyranny, has the same degrading effect on\r\nthe people--destroying their principle of self-action, without which we\r\nare all but as the beasts of the field.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the laying out of the earnings of the poor is sure, after a\r\ntime, to sink into “a job;” and I quote the above passage to show that,\r\ndespite the kindest management, eleemosynary help is _not_ a fitting\r\nadjunct to the industrial toil of independent labourers.\r\n\r\n_The residences of the street-orderlies_ are now in all quarters where\r\nunfurnished rooms are about 1_s._ 9_d._ or 2_s._ a week. The addresses\r\nI have cited show them residing in the outskirts and the heart of the\r\nmetropolis. The following returns, however, will indicate the ages, the\r\nprevious occupations, the education, church-going, the personal habits,\r\ndiet, rent, &c., of the class constituting the street-orderlies, better\r\nthan anything I can say on the matter.\r\n\r\nBefore any man is employed as a street-orderly, he is called upon\r\nto answer certain questions, and the replies from 67 men to these\r\nquestions supply a fund of curious and important information--important\r\nto all but those who account the lot of the poor of _no_ importance. In\r\npresenting these details, I beg to express my obligations to Mr. Colin\r\nMackenzie, the enlightened and kindly secretary of the Association.\r\n\r\nI shall first show what is the order of the questioning, then what were\r\nthe answers, and I shall afterwards recapitulate, with a few comments,\r\nthe salient characteristics of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe questions are after this fashion; the one I adduce having been\r\nasked of a scavager to whom a preference was given:--\r\n\r\n _The Parish of St. Mary, Paddington.--Questions asked of Parish\r\n Scavagers, applying for employment as Street-Orderlies, with the\r\n answers appended._\r\n\r\nName?--W---- C----.\r\n\r\nAge?--35 years.\r\n\r\nHow long a scavenger?--Three months.\r\n\r\nWhat occupation previously?--Gentleman’s footman.\r\n\r\nMarried or single?--Married.\r\n\r\nReading, writing, or other education?--Yes.\r\n\r\nAny children?--One.\r\n\r\nTheir ages?--Three years.\r\n\r\nWages?--Nine shillings per week.\r\n\r\nAny parish relief?--No.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What and how much food the applicants have usually purchased in a\r\nweek._\r\n\r\nMeat?--2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nBacon?--None.\r\n\r\nFish?--None.\r\n\r\nBread?---2_s._\r\n\r\nPotatoes?--4_d._\r\n\r\nButter?--6_d._\r\n\r\nTea and sugar?--1_s._\r\n\r\nCocoa?--None.\r\n\r\nWhat rent they pay?--2_s._\r\n\r\nFurnished or unfurnished lodgings?--Unfurnished.\r\n\r\nAny change of dress?--No.\r\n\r\nSunday clothing?--No.\r\n\r\nHow many shirts?--Two shirts.\r\n\r\nBoots and shoes?--One pair.\r\n\r\nHow much do they lay out for clothes in a year?--I have nothing but\r\nwhat I stand upright in.\r\n\r\nDo they go to church or chapel?--Sometimes.\r\n\r\nIf not, why not?--It is from want of clothes.\r\n\r\nDo they ever bathe?--No.\r\n\r\nDoes the wife go out to, or take in work?--Yes.\r\n\r\nWhat are her earnings?--Uncertain.\r\n\r\nDo they have anything from charitable institutions or families?--No.\r\n\r\nWhen ill; where do they resort to?--Hospitals, dispensaries, and the\r\nparish doctor.\r\n\r\nDo their children go to any school; and what?--Paddington.\r\n\r\nDo they ever save any money; how much, and where?--\r\n\r\nHow much do they spend per week in drink?\r\n\r\nDo not passers by, as charitable ladies, &c., give them money; and how\r\nmuch per week?--No.\r\n\r\nSuch, are the questions asked, and I now give the answers of 67\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Their ages were_:--\r\n\r\n  10 were from 20 to 30\r\n  13     „     30 „  40\r\n  24     „     40 „  50\r\n  15     „     50 to 60\r\n   4     „     60 „  70.\r\n   1     „     70\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of any age was 7 persons of 45 years respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Their previous occupations had been_:--\r\n\r\n  22 labourers.\r\n   3 at the business “all their lives.”\r\n   3 dustmen.\r\n   3 ostlers.\r\n   2 stablemen.\r\n   2 carmen.\r\n   2 porters.\r\n   2 gentlemen’s servants.\r\n   2 greengrocers.\r\n   1 following dust-cart.\r\n   1 excavator.\r\n   1 gravel digging.\r\n   1 stone breaking in yards.\r\n   1 at work in the brick-fields.\r\n   1 at work in the lime-works.\r\n   1 coal porter.\r\n   1 sweep.\r\n   1 haybinder.\r\n   1 gaslighter.\r\n   1 dairyman.\r\n   1 ploughman.\r\n   1 gardener.\r\n   1 errand boy.\r\n   1 fur dresser.\r\n   1 fur dyer.\r\n   1 skinner.\r\n   1 leather-dresser.\r\n   1 letter-press printer.\r\n   1 paper stainer.\r\n   1 glass blower.\r\n   1 farrier.\r\n   1 plasterer.\r\n   1 clerk.\r\n   1 vendor of goods.\r\n   1 licensed victualler.\r\n\r\nTherefore, of 67 scavagers\r\n\r\n  12 had been artizans.\r\n  55    „     unskilled workmen.\r\n\r\nHence about five-sixths belong to the unskilled class of operatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time of having been at scavagering._\r\n\r\n   3 “all their lives” at the business.\r\n   1 about 27 years.\r\n   6 from 15 to 20 years.\r\n   6   „  10  „ 15   „\r\n   4   „  5   „ 10 years.\r\n  34   „  1   „  5   „\r\n  13 twelve months and less.\r\n\r\nHence it would appear, that few have been at the business a long time.\r\nThe greater number have not been acting as scavagers more than five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n_State of education.--Could they read and write?_\r\n\r\n  45 answered yes.\r\n   4 replied that they could read and write.\r\n   5 could read only.\r\n  12 could do neither.\r\n   1 was deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nHence it would appear, that rather more than two-thirds of the\r\nscavagers have received _some little_ education.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Did they go to church or chapel?_\r\n\r\n  22 answered yes.\r\n   9 went to church.\r\n   4  „  chapel.\r\n   4  „  the Catholic chapel.\r\n   1  „  both church and chapel.\r\n   5 went sometimes.\r\n   1 not often.\r\n  17 never went at all.\r\n   1 was ashamed to go.\r\n   1 went out of town to enjoy himself.\r\n   2 made no return (1 being deaf and dumb).\r\n\r\nThus it would seem, that not quite two-thirds regularly attend some\r\nplace of worship; that about one-eleventh go occasionally; and that\r\nabout one-fourth never go at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Why did they not go to church?_\r\n\r\n  12 had no clothes.\r\n  55 returned no answer (1 being deaf and dumb).\r\n\r\nHence of those who never go (19 out of 67), very nearly two-thirds (say\r\n12 in 19) have no clothes to appear in.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Did they bathe?_\r\n\r\n  59 answered no.\r\n   3 replied yes.\r\n   2 said they did in the Thames.\r\n   2 returned “sometimes.”\r\n   1 was deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nHence it appeared, that about seven-eighths never bathe, although\r\nfollowing the filthiest occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Were they married or single?_\r\n\r\n  56 were married.\r\n   5   „  widowers.\r\n   6   „  single.\r\n\r\nThus it would seem, that about ten-elevenths are or have been married\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How many children had they?_\r\n\r\n   1 had 15.\r\n   1  „   6.\r\n   2  „   5 each.\r\n  11  „   4  „\r\n  19  „   3  „\r\n   9  „   2  „\r\n   6  „   1 each.\r\n  16  „  none (6 of these being single men).\r\n   2 returned their family as grown up without stating the number.\r\n\r\nConsequently 51 out of 61, or five-sixths, are married, and have\r\nfamilies numbering altogether 165 children; the majority had only 3\r\nchildren, and this was about the average family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What were the ages of their children?_\r\n\r\n  11 were grown up.\r\n   2 between 30 and 40.\r\n   9    „    20 and 30.\r\n  49    „    10 and 20.\r\n  80    „     1 and 10.\r\n   8 were 1 year and under.\r\n   5 were returned at home.\r\n   1 returned as dead.\r\n\r\nOne-half of the scavagers’ children, therefore, are between 1 and 10\r\nyears of age; the majority would appear to be 8 years old.\r\n\r\nSome were said to be grown up, but no number was given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Did their children go to school?_\r\n\r\n  13 answered yes.\r\n  13 to the National School.\r\n   5 to the Ragged School.\r\n   2 to Catholic.\r\n   2 to Parish.\r\n   6 to local schools.\r\n   1 replied that he went sometimes.\r\n   2 returned no.\r\n   1 replied that his children were “not with him.”\r\n  22 (of whom 16 had no children, and 1 was deaf and dumb) made no reply.\r\n\r\nFrom this it would seem, that a large majority--41 out of 51, or\r\nfour-fifths--of the parents who have children send them to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Did their wives work?_\r\n\r\n  15 returned no.\r\n   6 said their wives were “unable.”\r\n   1 had lost the use of her limbs.\r\n   2 did, but “not often.”\r\n   4 did “when they could.”\r\n  10 worked “sometimes.”\r\n  12 answered yes.\r\n   1 sold cresses.\r\n  15 made no return (11 having no wives and 1 being deaf and dumb).\r\n\r\nHence two-fifths of the wives (22 out of 56) do no work, 16 do so\r\noccasionally, and 13, or one-fourth, are in the habit of working.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What were wives’ earnings?_\r\n\r\n  10 returned them as “uncertain.”\r\n   1 “didn’t know.”\r\n   1 estimated them at 1_s._ 6_d._ per week.\r\n   1 at 1_s._ to 2_s._                 „\r\n   2 at 2_s._                               „\r\n   3 at 2_s._ or 3_s._                 „\r\n   2 at about 3_s._                         „\r\n   1 at 2_s._ to 4_s._                 „\r\n   1 at 3_s._ or 4_s._                 „\r\n   1 at 3_d._ or 4_d._ per day.\r\n  43 gave no returns (having either no wives, or their wives not working).\r\n   1 was deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nSo that, out of 29 wives who were said to work, 16 occasionally and 13\r\nregularly, there were returns for 23. Nearly half of their earnings\r\nwere given as uncertain from their seldom doing work, while the\r\nremainder were stated to gain from 1_s._ to 4_s._ per week; about 2_s._\r\n6_d._ perhaps would be a fair average.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What wages were they themselves in the habit of receiving?_\r\n\r\n   3 had 16_s._ 6_d._ per week.\r\n   2  „  16_s._                „\r\n  28  „  15_s._                „\r\n   3  „  14_s._ 6_d._     „\r\n   1  „  14_s._                „\r\n   2  „  12_s._                „\r\n  15  „   9_s._                „\r\n   4  „   8_s._                „\r\n   5  „   7_s._                „\r\n   4  „   1_s._ 1-1/2_d._ a day and 2 loaves.\r\n\r\nHence it is evident, that one-half receive 15_s._ or more a week, and\r\nabout a fourth 9_s._\r\n\r\nIt was not the parishes, however, but the contractors with the\r\nparishes, who paid the higher rates of wages: Mr. Dodd, for St.\r\nLuke’s; Mr. Westley, for St. Botolph’s, Bishopsgate; Mr. Parsons, for\r\nWhitechapel; Mr. Newman, for Bethnal-green, &c.\r\n\r\nThese wages the scavagers laid out in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_For rent, per week._\r\n\r\n   1 paid 4_s._\r\n   1   „  3_s._ 6_d._\r\n   8   „  3_s._\r\n  14   „  2_s._ 6_d._\r\n  33   „  2_s._\r\n   4   „  1_s._ 6_d._\r\n   1   „  1_s._ 3_d._\r\n   2   „  1_s._\r\n  1 lived rent free.\r\n  1 paid for board and lodging.\r\n  1 lived with mother.\r\n\r\nHence it would appear, that near upon half the number paid 2_s._ rent.\r\nThe usual rent paid seems to be between 2_s._ and 3_s._, five-sixths\r\nof the entire number paying one or other of those amounts. Only three\r\nlived in furnished lodgings, and the rents of these were, respectively,\r\ntwo at 2_s._ 6_d._ and the other at 2_s._\r\n\r\n\r\n_For bread, per week._\r\n\r\n   1 expended 5_s._ 3_d._\r\n   1    „     5_s._\r\n   1    „     4_s._ 7_d._\r\n   1    „     4_s._ 6_d._\r\n   1    „     4_s._ 3_d._\r\n   7    „     4_s._\r\n  13    „     3_s._ 6_d._\r\n   8    „     3_s._\r\n   3    „     2_s._ 6_d._\r\n   4    „     2_s._ 3_d._\r\n  13    „     2_s._\r\n   4    „     1_s._ 6_d._\r\n   1    „     1_s._ 9_d._\r\n   4 two loaves a day from parish.\r\n   3 gave a certain sum per week to their wives or mothers to\r\n     lay out for them, and 1 boarded and lodged.\r\n   1 was deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nThus it would seem, that the general sum expended weekly on bread\r\nvaries between 2_s._ and 4_s._ The average saving from free-trade,\r\ntherefore, would be between 4_d._ and 8_d._, or say 6_d._, per week.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For meat, per week._\r\n\r\n   4 expended 4_s._\r\n   5    „     3_s._ 6_d._\r\n  11    „     3_s._\r\n  12    „     2_s._ 6_d._\r\n   1    „     2_s._ 4_d._\r\n   5    „     2_s._\r\n   4    „     1_s._ 6_d._\r\n   1    „     1_s._ 2_d._\r\n   9    „     1_s._\r\n   2    „     10_d._\r\n   2    „     6_d._\r\n   1    „     8_d._\r\n   1 once a week.\r\n   4 had none.\r\n   5 no returns (3 of this number gave a weekly allowance to\r\n     wives or mothers, 1 was deaf and dumb, and 1 paid for\r\n     board and lodging).\r\n\r\nBy the above we see, that the sum usually expended on meat is between\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ and 3_s._ per week, about one-third of the entire number\r\nexpending that sum. All those who expended 1_s._ and less per week had\r\n9_s._ and less for their week’s labour.

The inquiry is not discouraging\r\nas to the character of the poor, and I must call attention to the\r\ncircumstance of how rarely it is that so large a collection of facts\r\nis placed at the command of a public writer. In many of the public\r\noffices the simplest information is as jealously withheld as if\r\nstatistical knowledge were the first and last steps to high treason.\r\nI trust that Mr. Cochrane’s example in the skilful arrangement of the\r\nreturns connected with the Association over which he presides, and his\r\ncourteous readiness to supply the information, gained at no small care\r\nand cost, will be more freely followed, as such a course unquestionably\r\ntends to the public benefit.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from these statements, how hard the struggle often\r\nis to obtain work in unskilled labour, and, when obtained, how bare\r\nthe living. Every farthing earned by such workpeople is necessarily\r\nexpended in the support of a family; and in the foregoing details\r\nwe have another proof as to the diminution of the purchasing fund\r\nof the country, being in direct proportion to the diminution of the\r\nwages. If 100 men receive but 7_s._ a week each for their work, their\r\nyearly outlay, to “keep the bare life in them,” is 1820_l._ If they\r\nare paid 16_s._ a week, their outlay is 4160_l._; an expenditure of\r\n2340_l._ more in the productions of our manufactures, in all textile,\r\nmetal, or wooden fabrics; in bread, meat, fruit, or vegetables; and\r\nin the now necessaries, the grand staple of our foreign and colonial\r\ntrade--tea, coffee, cocoa, sugar, rice, and tobacco. _Increase your\r\nwages, therefore, and you increase your markets._ For manufacturers to\r\nunderpay their workmen is to cripple the demand for manufactures. To\r\ntalk of the over-production of our cotton, linen, and woollen goods is\r\nidle, when thousands of men engaged in such productions are in rags. It\r\nis not that there are too many makers, but too few who, owing to the\r\ndecrease of wages, are able to be buyers. Let it be remembered that,\r\nout of 67 labouring men, three-fourths could not afford to buy proper\r\nclothing, expending thereupon “little” or “nothing,” and, I may add,\r\n_because_ earning little or nothing, and so having scarcely anything to\r\nexpend.\r\n\r\nI now come to _the cost of cleansing the streets upon the\r\nstreet-orderly system_, as compared with that of the ordinary modes\r\nof payment to contractors, &c. It will have been observed, from what\r\nhas been previously stated, that the Council of the Association\r\ncontend that far higher amounts may be realized for street manure when\r\ncollected clean, according to the street-orderly plan. If, by a better\r\nmode of collecting the street dirt, it be kept unmixed, its increase in\r\nvalue and in price may be most positively affirmed.\r\n\r\nBefore presenting estimates and calculations of cost, I may remind the\r\nreader that, under the street-orderly system, no watering carts are\r\nrequired, and none are used where the system is carried out in its\r\nintegrity. To be able to dispense with the watering of the streets is\r\nnot merely to get rid of a great nuisance, but to effect a considerable\r\nsaving in the rates.\r\n\r\nI now give two estimates, both relating to the same district:--\r\n\r\n\r\n COMPARATIVE EXPENSE OF CLEANING AND WATERING THE STREETS, &C., OF\r\n ST.

It is assumed, from reasonable data,\r\n that the superficial contents of all the streets, lanes, courts, and\r\n alleys in the parish, do not amount to more than 80,000 square yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Present Annual Expense of Cleansing St. James’s Parish_:--\r\n\r\n    Paid to contractor for carrying away slop,\r\n  including expense of brooms                       £800  0  0\r\n    Paid to 23 men, average wages, 10_s._ per\r\n  week, 52 weeks                                     598  0  0\r\n                                                   -----------\r\n                                                   £1398  0  0\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Annual Expense of Street-Orderly System_:--\r\n\r\n    30 men (including those with\r\n  hand-barrows), at 10_s._ per week,\r\n  52 weeks              £780  0  0\r\n    Expense of brooms     30  0  0\r\n    Cartage of slop      100  0  0\r\n                       -----------                  £910  0  0\r\n                                                   -----------\r\n                                                    £488  0  0\r\n    Saving by diminished expense of street-watering\r\n  throughout the parish                              450  0  0\r\n                                                   -----------\r\n    Annual prospective saving                       £938  0  0\r\n\r\n“Obs.--The sum of 800_l._ per annum was paid to the contractor on\r\naccount of expenses incurred for the removal of slop. During the three\r\nyears previous to 1849, the contractor paid money to the parish for\r\npermission to remove the house-ashes, the value of which was then\r\n2_s._ per load; it is now 2_s._ 6_d._ In St. Giles’s and St. George’s\r\nparishes, whose surface is more than twice the extent of St. James’s,\r\nthe expense of slop-cartage, in 1850, was 304_l._ 14_s._ 0_d._, whilst\r\nthe sum received for cattle-manure collected by street-orderlies,\r\nwas 73_l._ 14_s._ 0_d._; and the slop-expenses for the four months\r\nending November 29, were 59_l._ 18_s._ 6_d._, whilst the manure sold\r\nfor 21_l._ 6_s._ 0_d._ Thus has the slop-expense in these extensive\r\nunited parishes been reduced to less than 120_l._ per annum. Since the\r\npreceding estimate was submitted to the Commissioners of Paving, the\r\nstreet-orderly system has been introduced into St. James’s parish; and\r\nit is confidently expected that the ‘Annual Prospective saving’ of\r\n938_l._, will be fully realised.”\r\n\r\nA similar estimate has just been sent into the authorities of the great\r\nparish of St. Marylebone, but its results do not differ from the one I\r\nhave just cited.\r\n\r\nI next present an estimate contrasting the expense of the\r\nstreet-orderly method with the cost of employing sweeping-machines:--\r\n\r\n “COMPARATIVE EXPENSE OF CLEANSING AND WATERING THE STREETS, &C., OF\r\n ST.

It is assumed, from reasonable data,\r\n that the superficial contents of all the streets, lanes, courts, and\r\n alleys in the parish, amount to about 70,000 square yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Expenses by Machinery in St. Martin’s Parish._\r\n\r\n                                                           £   _s._  _d._\r\n  Annual payment to street-machine proprietor             980    0    0\r\n  Watering rate (1847)                                    644   16    8-1/2\r\n  Salaries to clerks                                      391    0    0\r\n  Support of 28 able-bodied men in workhouse,\r\n    thrown out of work, at 4_s._ 6_d._ per man            327   12    0\r\n                                                        -------------------\r\n                                                        £2343    8    8-1/2\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Expenditure by the Employment of Street-Orderlies._\r\n\r\n                                                         £   _s._  _d._\r\n  Maintenance of 28 street-orderlies to keep clean\r\n    70,000 yards (presumed contents), at 2500 yards\r\n    each man, at 12_s._ per week                        768    0    0\r\n  Two inspectors of orderlies, at 15_s._ per week        78    0    0\r\n  One superintendent of ditto, at 1_l._ per week         52    0    0\r\n  Wear and tear of brooms                                36    8    0\r\n  Interest on outlay for barrows, brooms, and shovels    26   19    0\r\n  Watering rate (not required)                           ..   ..   ..\r\n  Value of manure pays for cartage                       ..   ..   ..\r\n                                                        -----------------\r\n                                                        961    7    0\r\n  Annual saving by street-orderlies                    1382    1    8-1/2\r\n                                                       ------------------\r\n                                                       2343    8    8-1/2\r\n\r\nI now give an estimate concerning a smaller district, _one of the\r\ndivisions of St. Pancras parish_. It was embodied in a Report read\r\nat a meeting in Camden-town, on the desirableness of introducing the\r\nstreet-orderly system:--\r\n\r\nThe Report set forth that the Committee had “made a minute\r\ninvestigation into the present systems of street-cleansing, as adopted\r\nunder the superintendence of Mr. Bird, the parish surveyor, and under\r\nthat of the National Philanthropic Association.\r\n\r\n “From the 26th of March, 1848, to the 26th of March, 1849, the\r\n _Directors of the Poor expended in paving and cleansing, &c., the\r\n three and a quarter miles under their charge_, 3545_l._ 19_s._ 7_d._;\r\n of this the following items were for cleansing, viz.--\r\n\r\n                                                         £    _s._  _d._\r\n  Labour                                                249    13     0\r\n  Tools                                                  10    12     0\r\n  Slop carting                                          496     0     0\r\n  Proportion of foreman’s salary                         39     0     0\r\n                                                        ---------------\r\n                                                        795     5     0\r\n\r\n “_The street-orderly system of cleansing_ the said roads in the most\r\n efficient manner would give the following expenditure per annum:--\r\n\r\n                                                         £    _s._  _d._\r\n  Thirty-four men to cleanse 3-1/4 miles, at the\r\n    rate of 2000 superficial yards each man, 12_s._\r\n    per week each                                      1060    16     0\r\n  Two inspectors of orderlies, at 15_s._ per week\r\n    each                                                 78     0     0\r\n  Superintendent                                        104     0     0\r\n  Cost of brooms, shovels, &c.                           83     0     0\r\n  No allowance for slop-carting, the National\r\n    Philanthropic Association holding that the\r\n    manure, properly collected, will more than\r\n    pay for its removal                                  ..    ..    ..\r\n                                                       ----------------\r\n                                                       1325    16     0\r\n  Deduct cost of cleansing by the old mode              795     5     0\r\n                                                       ----------------\r\n                                                        530    11     0\r\n\r\n“The apparent extra cost, therefore, would be 530_l._ 11_s._ The\r\nvestry, however, would see that the charge for supporting 34\r\nable-bodied men in the workhouse is at least 5_s._ per week each, or\r\n442_l._ per annum. This, therefore, must be deducted from the 530_l._\r\n11_s._, leaving the extra cost 88_l._ 11_s._ per annum. This sum, the\r\ncommittee were assured, will be not only repaid by the reduced outlay\r\nfor repairs, which the new system will effect; but a very great saving\r\nwill be the result of the thorough cleansed state in which the roads\r\nwill be constantly maintained. Under the late system, to find the\r\nroads in a cleansed state was the exception, not the rule; and when\r\nall the advantages likely to result from the new system were taken\r\ninto consideration, the committee did not hesitate to recommend it for\r\nadoption in its most efficient form.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the _expense of cleansing the City by the street-orderly\r\nsystem_, Mr. Cochrane says:--\r\n\r\n “The number required for the whole surface (including the footways,\r\n courts, &c.) would be about 250 men and boys.\r\n\r\n “Upon the present system this number would be formed in three\r\n divisions:--\r\n\r\n “First division.--170 to begin work at 6 a.m., and end 6 p.m. Second\r\n division, called relief and aids.--30 boys from 12 at noon to 10.\r\n Third division--50 men from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Total, 250.\r\n\r\n “The men and boys are now working at from 6_s._ to 12_s._ per week.\r\n\r\n  These 250 men and boys would cost for wages during the\r\n    year about                                              £5100\r\n  Twelve foremen, at 40_l._ per annum                         480\r\n  Two superintendents at 50_l._ each                          100\r\n  Brooms, &c.                                                 325\r\n  Barrows                                                     100\r\n  Two clerks, at 100_l._ each                                 200\r\n  Manager                                                     100\r\n                                                            -----\r\n                                                            £6405\r\n\r\n “No items are given for slopping or cartage, as, if the streets are\r\n properly attended to, there ought to be no slop, whilst the value of\r\n the manure may be more than equivalent for the expense of its removal.\r\n\r\n “Some slop-carts will, however, be occasionally required for\r\n Smithfield-market and similar localities; making, therefore,\r\n ample allowance for contingencies, it is confidently considered\r\n that the expense for cleansing the whole of the city of London by\r\n street-orderlies would not exceed 8000_l._ per annum.”\r\n\r\n   “_Expenses of Cleansing and Watering the Streets, &c., of the City\r\n   of London, on the old system of Scavaging, from June, 1845, to June,\r\n   1846._\r\n\r\n                                                           Annual\r\n                                                          Expense.\r\n  To scavaging contractors                                  £6040\r\n  Value of ashes and dust of the city of London, given\r\n    gratis to the above contractors in the year ending\r\n    1846, and now purchased by them for the year ending\r\n    1847                                                     5500\r\n  Estimated contributions levied for watering streets        4000\r\n  Salaries to surveyors, inspectors, beadles, clerks,\r\n    &c., of Sewers’ Office, according to printed account,\r\n    March 3, 1846                                            2485\r\n  Expense for cleaning out sewers and gully-holes\r\n    (not known)\r\n                                                          -------\r\n  Annual expense under the imperfect system of\r\n    street-cleansing                                      £18,025\r\n\r\n “Number of men employed, 58.\r\n\r\n “State of the Streets:--Inhabitants always complaining of their being\r\n muddy in winter and dusty in summer.”\r\n\r\nTwo estimates, then, show an expectation of a yearly saving of no less\r\nthan 2320_l._ to the rate-payers of two parishes alone; 938_l._ to St.\r\nJames’s, and 1382_l._ to St. Martin’s. And this, too, if all that be\r\naugured of this system be realized, with a freedom from street dust\r\nand dirt unknown under other methods of scavagery. I think it right,\r\nhowever, to express my opinion that even in the reasonable prospect\r\nof these great savings being effected, it is a paltry, or rather a\r\nfalse, because miscalled, economy to speculate on the payment of\r\n10_s._ and 12_s._ a week to street-labourers in the parishes of St.\r\nJames and St. Martin respectively, when so many of the contractors pay\r\ntheir men 16_s._ weekly. If this low hire be justifiable in the way\r\nof an experiment, it can never be justifiable as a continuance of the\r\n_reward_ of labour.\r\n\r\nIf the street-orderly system is to be the means of _permanently_\r\nreducing the wages of the regular scavagers from 16_s._ to 12_s._ a\r\nweek, then we had better remain afflicted with the physical dirt of our\r\nstreets, than the moral filth which is sure to proceed from the poverty\r\nof our people--but if it is to be a means of elevating the pauper\r\nto the dignity of the independent labour, rather than dragging the\r\nindependent labourer down to the debasement of the pauper, then let all\r\nwho wish well to their fellows encourage it as heartily and strenuously\r\nas they can--otherwise the sooner it is denounced as an insidious mode\r\nof defrauding the poor of one-fourth of their earnings the better; and\r\nit is merely in the belief that Mr. Cochrane and the Council of the\r\nAssociation _mean_ to keep faith with the public and increase the men’s\r\nwages to those of the regular trade, that the street-orderly system\r\nis advocated here. If our philanthropists are to reduce wages 25 per\r\ncent., then, indeed, the poor man may cry, “_save me from my friends_.”\r\n\r\nAs to the positive and definite working of the street-orderly system\r\nas an _economical_ system, no information can be given beyond\r\nthe estimates I have cited, as it has never been duly tested on\r\na sufficiently large scale. Its working has been, of necessity,\r\ndesultory. It has, however, been introduced into St. George’s,\r\nBloomsbury; St. James’s, Westminster; and is about to be established in\r\nSt. Martin’s-in-the-Fields; and in the course of a year or two it seems\r\nthat it will be sufficiently tested. That its working has hitherto\r\nbeen desultory is a necessity in London, where “vested interests” look\r\ngrimly on any change or even any inquiry. That it deserves a full and\r\nliberal testing seems undeniable, from the concurrent assent of all\r\nparishioners who have turned their attention to it.\r\n\r\nIt remains to show the expenses of the Philanthropic Association, for\r\nI am unable to present an account of street-orderlyism separately. The\r\ntwo following tables fully indicate to what an extent the association\r\nis indebted to the private purse of Mr. Cochrane, who by this time has\r\nadvanced between 6000_l._ and 7000_l._\r\n\r\n\r\n“BALANCE SHEET.\r\n\r\n _Receipts and Expenditure of the National Philanthropic Association,\r\n for the Promotion of Social and Sanatory Improvements and the\r\n Employment of the Poor, from 29th September, 1846, to 29th September,\r\n 1849._\r\n\r\n  DR.                                               £  _s._  _d._\r\n  To subscriptions and donations from the 29th\r\n    September, 1846, to 29th September, 1849      1393  16    7\r\n  Balance due to president, 29th September,\r\n    1849                                          5739  19    9\r\n                                                  -------------\r\n                                                  7133  16    4\r\n\r\n  CR.                                               £  _s._  _d._\r\n  By balance due to president, as per Balance\r\n    Sheet, Sept. 29, 1846                         2935  17     9\r\n  Secretary’s salary                               300   0     0\r\n  Rent of offices, &c.                             248  10     0\r\n  Salaries to clerks, messengers, &c.              371  19     4\r\n  Do. to collectors                                312  18     1\r\n  Commission to do.                                130   5     6\r\n  Printing and stationery                          556  17     0\r\n  Hire of rooms for public meetings                 60  10     0\r\n  Advertisements and newspapers                    244   5     3\r\n  Bill posting                                       8  12     6\r\n  Salaries to persons in charge of free\r\n    lavatories in Ham-yard, Great Windmill-st.,\r\n    St. James’s                                     10  18     2\r\n  Brooms, barrows, and shovels, for the use of\r\n    street-orderlies                                86   8     0\r\n  Charges of contractors and others for removal\r\n    of street slop, &c.                             58   9     6\r\n  Food, lodging, and wages to street-orderlies,\r\n    domiciled in Ham-yard, Great Windmill-street,\r\n    St. James’s                                    980  11     4\r\n  Clothing for the street-orderlies                 13   3     2\r\n  Baths provided for do.                             5  15    10\r\n  Sundry expenses for offices, including\r\n    postage-stamps, &c.                             92   7    11\r\n  Law expenses                                       8  10    10\r\n  Builder’s charges for free lavatories in\r\n    Ham-yard                                        95  13    10\r\n  Amount advanced to the late secretary for\r\n    improving the dwellings of the poor             20   0     0\r\n  Farther advances made by president on various\r\n    occasions for the general purposes of the\r\n    Association                                    592   2     4\r\n                                                  --------------\r\n                                                  7133  16     4\r\n\r\n Audited by us, Oct. 19th, 1849, Charles Shepherd Lenton, 33,\r\n Leicester-square; and Joseph Child, 43, Leicester-square.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREET-ORDERLIES.--CITY SURVEYOR’S REPORT.\r\n\r\nI have been favoured with a Report “upon street-cleansing and in\r\nreference to the Street-Orderly System,” by the author, Mr. W. Haywood,\r\nthe Surveyor to the City Commission of Sewers, who has invited my\r\nattention to the matter, in consequence of the statements which have\r\nappeared on the subject in “London Labour and the London Poor.”\r\n\r\nMr. Haywood, whose tone of argument is courteous and moderate, and who\r\ndoes not scruple to do justice to what he accounts the good points of\r\nthe street-orderly system, although he condemns it as a whole, gives\r\nan account of the earlier scavaging of the city, not differing in any\r\nmaterial respect from that which I have already printed. He represents\r\nthe public ways of the City, which I have stated to be about 50 miles,\r\nas “about 51 miles lineal, about 770,157 superficial yards in area.”\r\nThis area, it appears, comprehends 1000 different places.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 the area of the carriage-way of the City was estimated at\r\n418,000 square yards, and the footway at 316,000, making a total of\r\n734,000; but since that period new streets have been made and others\r\nextensively widened. The precincts of Bridewell, St. Bartholomew, St.\r\nJames’s, Duke’s-place, Aldgate, and others, have been added to the\r\njurisdiction of the Sewers Commission by Act of Parliament, so that\r\nthe Surveyor now estimates the area of the carriage-way of the City of\r\nLondon at 441,250 square yards, and the footway at 328,907, making a\r\ntotal of 770,157 square yards.\r\n\r\n“I am fully impressed,” observes Mr. Haywood, “with the great\r\nimportance to a densely-populated city of an efficient cleansing of the\r\npublic ways. Probably after a perfect system of sewage and drainage\r\n(which implies an adequate water supply), and a well-paved surface\r\n(which I have always considered to be little inferior in its importance\r\nto the former, and which is indispensable to obtaining clean sweeping),\r\ngood surface cleansing ranks next in its beneficial sanitary influence;\r\nand most certainly the comfort gained by all through having public\r\nthoroughfares in a high degree of cleanliness is exceedingly great.”\r\n\r\nMr. Haywood expresses his opinion that streets “ordure\r\nsoddened”--smelling like “stable yards,”--dangerous to the health\r\nof the inhabitants--impassable from mud in winter and from dust in\r\nsummer--and inflicting constant pecuniary loss, “can only exist in\r\nan appreciable degree in thoroughfares swept much less frequently”\r\nthan the streets within the jurisdiction of the City Commissioners\r\nof Sewers. In this opinion, however, Mr. Haywood comes into direct\r\ncollision with the statements put forth by the Board of Health, who\r\nhave insisted upon the insanitary state of the metropolitan streets,\r\nmore strongly, perhaps, in their several Reports, than has Mr. Cochrane.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Haywood believes that not only are the assertions of the\r\nBoard of Health as to the unwholesome state of the metropolitan\r\nthoroughfares unfounded as regards the city of London, but he asserts\r\nthat from the daily street-sweeping, “the surface there is maintained\r\nin as high an average condition of cleanliness, as the means hitherto\r\nadopted will enable to be attained.”\r\n\r\n“Nor does this apply,” says Mr. Haywood, “to the main thoroughfares\r\nonly. In the poorer courts and alleys within the city, where a high\r\ndegree of cleanliness is, at least, as needful, in a sanitary point\r\nof view, as in the larger and wider thoroughfares, the facilities for\r\nefficient sweeping are as great, if not greater, than in other portions\r\nof your jurisdiction. For many years past the whole of the courts and\r\nalleys which carts do not enter, have been paved with flagstone, laid\r\nat a good inclination, and presenting an uniform smooth _non-absorbent_\r\nsurface: in many of these courts where the habits of the people are\r\ncleanly, the scavenger’s broom is almost unneeded for weeks together;\r\nin others, where the habit prevails of throwing the refuse of the\r\nhouses upon the pavements, the daily sweeping is highly essential; but\r\nin all these courts the surface presents a condition which renders good\r\nclean sweeping a comparatively easy operation, that which is swept away\r\nbeing mostly dry, or nearly so.”\r\n\r\nAfter alluding to the street-orderly principle of scavaging, “to clean\r\nand keep clean,” Mr. Haywood observes, “between the ‘_street-orderly\r\nsystem_’ and the periodical or intermittent sweeping there is this\r\ndifference, that upon the former system there should be (if it fulfils\r\nwhat it professes) no deposit of any description allowed to remain much\r\nlonger than a few minutes upon the surface, and that there should be\r\nneither mud in the wet weather, nor dust in the dry weather, upon the\r\npublic ways; whilst, upon the latter system, the deposit necessarily\r\naccumulates between the periods of sweeping, commencing as soon as one\r\nsweeping has terminated, gradually increasing, and being at its point\r\nof extreme accumulation at the period when the next sweeping takes\r\nplace; the former, then, is, or should be, a system of prevention; the\r\nlatter, confessedly, but a system of palliation or cure.\r\n\r\n“The more frequent the periodical sweeping, therefore, the nearer it\r\napproximates in its results to the ‘_street-orderly system_,’ inasmuch\r\nas the accumulations, being frequently removed, must be smaller, and\r\nthe evils of mud, dust, effluvia, &c., less in proportion.\r\n\r\n“Now to fulfil its promise: upon the ‘street-orderly system,’ there\r\nshould be men both day and night within the streets, who should\r\nconstantly remove the manure and refuse, and, failing this, if there be\r\nonly cessation for six hours out of the twenty-four of the ‘continuous\r\ncleansing,’ it becomes at once a periodical cleansing but a degree\r\nin advance of the daily sweeping, which has been now for years in\r\noperation within the city of London.”\r\n\r\nThis appears to me to be an extreme conclusion:--because the labours\r\nof the street-orderly system cease when the great traffic ceases, and\r\nwhen, of course, there is comparatively little or no dirt deposited\r\nin the thoroughfares, therefore, says Mr. Haywood, “the City system of\r\ncleansing once per day is _only a degree_ behind that system of which\r\nthe principle is incessant cleansing at such time as the dirtying\r\nis incessant.” The two principles are surely as different as light\r\nand darkness:--in the one the cleansing is intermittent and the dirt\r\nconstant; in the other the dirt is intermittent and the cleanliness\r\nconstant--constant, at least, so long as the causes of impurity are so.\r\n\r\nMr. Haywood, however, states that the Commissioners were so pleased\r\nwith the appearance of the streets, when cleansed on the street-orderly\r\nsystem, which “was _certainly much to be admired_,” that they\r\nintroduced a somewhat similar system, calling their scavagers “daymen,”\r\nas they had the care of _keeping_ the streets clean, _after_ a daily\r\nmorning sweeping by the contractor’s men. They commenced their work\r\nat 9 A.M. and ceased at 6 P.M. in the summer months, and at half-past\r\n4 P.M. in the winter. In the summer months 36 daymen were employed on\r\nthe average; in the winter months, 46. The highest number of scavaging\r\ndaymen employed on any one day was 63; the lowest was 34. The area\r\ncleansed was about 47,000 yards (superficial measure), and with the\r\nfollowing results, and the following cost, from June 24, 1846, to the\r\nsame date, 1847:--\r\n\r\n                                                   Yards\r\n                                                Superficial.\r\n  The average area cleansed during the summer\r\n    months, per man per diem, was                   1298\r\n  Ditto during winter, per man per diem, was        1016\r\n  The average of both summer and winter months\r\n    was, per man per diem                           1139\r\n                                                  ------\r\n  The cost of the experiment was for daymen\r\n    (including brooms, barrows, shovels,\r\n    cartage, &c.)[29]                          £1450  18\r\n  One Foreman at                                  78   0\r\n                                                --------\r\n  And the total cost of the experiment         £1528  18\r\n\r\n“The daily sweeping,” Mr. Haywood says, “which for the previous\r\ntwo years had been established throughout the City, gave at that\r\ntime _very great satisfaction_. It was quite true that the streets\r\nwhich the daymen attended to, _looked superior_ to those cleansed\r\nonly _periodically_, but the practical value of the difference was\r\nconsidered by many not to be worth the sum of money paid for it. It\r\nwas also felt that, if it was continued, it should upon principle be\r\nextended at least to all streets of similar traffic to those upon which\r\nit had been tried; and as, after due consideration, the Commission\r\nthought that one daily sweeping was sufficient, both for health and\r\ncomfort, the day or continuous sweeping was abandoned, and the whole\r\nCity only received, from that time to the present, the usual daily\r\nsweeping.”\r\n\r\nThe “present” time is shown by the date of Mr. Haywood’s Report,\r\nOctober 13, 1851. The reason assigned for the abandonment of the\r\nsystem of the daymen is peculiar and characteristic. The system of\r\ncontinuous cleansing gave very great satisfaction, although it was but\r\na degree in advance of the once-a-day cleansing. The streets which\r\nthe daymen attended to “looked,” and of course were, “superior” in\r\ncleanliness to those scavaged periodically. It was also felt that\r\nthe principle should “be extended at least to all streets of similar\r\ntraffic;” and why was it not so extended? Because, in a word, “it was\r\nnot worth the money;” though by what standard the value of public\r\ncleanliness was calculated, is not mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe main question, therefore, is, what is the difference in the cost of\r\nthe two systems, and _is_ the admitted “superior cleanliness” produced\r\nby the continuous mode of scavaging, in comparison with that obtained\r\nby the intermittent mode, of sufficient public value to warrant the\r\nincreased expense (if any)--in a word, as the City people say--is it\r\n_worth the money_?\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the comparative cost of the two systems: after a\r\nstatement of the contracts for the dusting and cleansing of the City\r\n(matters I have before treated of) Mr. Haywood, for the purpose of\r\nmaking a comparison of the present City system of scavaging with the\r\nstreet-orderly system, gives the table in the opposite page to show the\r\ncost of street cleansing and dusting within the jurisdiction of the\r\nCity Court of Sewers.\r\n\r\nMr. Haywood then invites attention to the subjoined statement of\r\nthe National Philanthropic Association, on the occurrence of a\r\ndemonstration as to the efficiency and economy of the street-orderly\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n “Association for the Promotion of Street Paving, Cleansing, Draining,\r\n &c., 20, Vere Street, Oxford Street, January 26th, 1846.\r\n\r\n “Approximation to the total Expenses connected with cleansing, as an\r\n experiment, certain parts of the City of London, commencing December,\r\n 1845, for the period of two months.\r\n\r\n  “350 brooms, being an average of 5 brooms             £.  _s._  _d._\r\n    for each man                                        23   18    10\r\n  For carting                                           99    1     9\r\n  For advertising                                       65    0     0\r\n  For rent of store-room, 3_l._ 14_s._; Clerks’\r\n    salaries, 12_l._; Messengers, 5_l._ 5_s._; wooden\r\n    clogs for men, 2_l._ 5_s._ 10_d._; expenses of\r\n    washing wood pavement, 5_l._                        28    4    10\r\n  Expenses of barrows                                   24   14     0\r\n  Christmas dinner to men, foremen, and\r\n    superintendents (97)                                15   12     6\r\n  83 men (averaging at 2_s._ 6_d._ per day) for\r\n    9 weeks                                            573   15     0\r\n  4 superintendents at 25_s._ 4_d._, foreman at\r\n    18_s._, cart foreman 20_s._, storekeeper 18_s._,\r\n    chief superintendents 2_l._, for 9 weeks           112   10     0\r\n  For various small articles, brushes, rakes,\r\n    &c.                                                 36    7     8\r\n  Petty expenses of the office, postages, &c.,\r\n    and stationery                                       6    0     0\r\n                                                      ---------------\r\n  Approximation to the total cost of the expense      £987    4     7\r\n                                                      ---------------\r\n\r\n Signed, M.

In 1849 the area of\r\n the jurisdiction of the Commission was increased by the addition of\r\n various precincts under the City of London Sewers’ Act.\r\n\r\n“The total cost of the experiment was £987 4_s._ 7_d._, and, deducting\r\nthe charges under the head of advertising, Christmas dinner, and petty\r\ncash expenses, and also that for office-rent, clerks, messengers, &c.,\r\nand assigning £50 as the value of the implements at that time for\r\nfuture use, there is left a balance of £822 7_s._ 3_d._ as the clear\r\ncost of the experiment.\r\n\r\n“The experiment was tried for a period of eight weeks exactly,\r\naccording to the return made to the Commission by the Superintendent of\r\nthe Association, but as in the statement of expenses the wages appear\r\nto be included for a period of nine weeks, I have assumed nine weeks as\r\nthe correct figure, and the experiment must therefore have cost a sum\r\nof £822 7_s._ 3_d._ for that period, or at the rate of about £91 per\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n                                            Squ. Yards\r\n  “Now the total area of the carriage-way\r\n    of the City of London was at that time    418,000\r\n  “And the area of the foot-way               316,000\r\n                                              -------\r\n                  “Making a total of          734,000\r\n\r\n  “And the area of the carriage-way\r\n    cleaned by the street-orderlies was        30,670\r\n  “And the area of the foot-way                18,590\r\n                                              -------\r\n                  “Making a total of           49,260\r\n\r\n“The total area of foot-way and carriage-way cleansed was therefore\r\n1-15th of the whole of the carriage-way and foot-way of the City; or,\r\ntaken separately, the carriage-way cleansed was somewhat more than\r\n1-14th of the whole of the City carriage-way.\r\n\r\n  “It has been seen also that the total cost of\r\n  cleansing this 1-14th portion of the carriage-way,\r\n  after deducting all extraneous expenses, was at\r\n  the rate per week of                            £91\r\n  Or at the rate, per annum, of                 £4732\r\n\r\n“To assign an expenditure in the same proportion for the remaining\r\n13-14ths of the whole carriage-way area of the City would not be just,\r\nfor, in the first place, allowance must be made, owing to the dirt\r\nbrought off from the adjacent streets, which, it is assumed, would not\r\nhave been the case had they also been cleansed upon the street-orderly\r\nsystem; and moreover, as the majority of the streets cleansed were\r\nthose of large traffic, a larger proportion of labour was needed to\r\nthem than would have been the case had the experiment been upon any\r\nequal area of carriage-way, taken from a district comprehending streets\r\nof all sizes and degrees of traffic; but if I assume that the 1-14th\r\nportion of the City cleansed represents 1-11th of the whole in the\r\nlabour needed for cleansing the whole of the City upon the same system,\r\nI believe I shall have made a very fair deduction, and shall, if\r\nanything, err in favour of the experiment.\r\n\r\n“Estimating, therefore, the expense of cleansing the whole of the City\r\ncarriage-way upon the street-orderly system according to the expenses\r\nof the experiment made in 1845-6, and from the data then furnished, it\r\nappears that cleansing upon such system would have come to an annual\r\nsum of 52,052_l._\r\n\r\n“It will be seen that there is a remarkable difference between this\r\nestimate of 52,052_l._ per annum and that of 18,000_l._ per annum\r\nestimated by the Association, and given in their Report of the 26th\r\nJanuary, 1846; and what is more remarkable is, that my estimate is\r\nframed not upon any assumption of my own, but is a dry calculation\r\nbased upon the very figures of expense furnished by the Association\r\nitself, and herein-before recited.”\r\n\r\nA second demonstration, carried on in the City by the street-orderlies,\r\nis detailed by Mr. Haywood, but as he draws the same conclusions from\r\nit, there is no necessity to do other than allude to it here.\r\n\r\nAccording to the above estimate, it certainly must be admitted that\r\nthe difference between the two accounts is, as Mr. Haywood says,\r\n“remarkable”--the one being nearly three times more than the other.\r\nBut let us, for fairness’ sake, test the cost of cleansing the City\r\nthoroughfares upon the continuous plan of scavaging by the figures\r\ngiven in Mr. Haywood’s own report, and see whether the above conclusion\r\nis warranted by the facts there stated. From June, 1846, to June, 1847,\r\nwe have seen that several of the main streets in the City were cleansed\r\ncontinuously throughout the day by what were called “daymen”--that is\r\nto say, 47,000 superficial yards of the principal thoroughfares were\r\n_kept_ clean (_after_ the daily cleansing of them by the contractor’s\r\nmen) by a body of men similar in their mode of operation to the\r\nstreet-orderlies, and who removed all the dirt as soon as deposited\r\nbetween the hours of the principal traffic. The cost of this experiment\r\n(for such it seems to have been) was, for the twelve months, as we\r\nhave seen, 1528_l._ 18_s._ Now if the expense of cleansing 47,000\r\nsuperficial yards upon the continuous method was 1529_l._, then,\r\naccording to Cocker, 770,157 yards (the total area of the public ways\r\nof the City) would cost 25,054_l._; and, adding to this 6328_l._ for\r\nthe sum paid to the contractors for the daily scavaging, we have only\r\n31,382_l._ for the gross expense of cleansing the whole of the City\r\nthoroughfares once a day by the “regular scavagers,” and _keeping_\r\nthem clean _afterwards_ by a body similar to the street-orderlies--a\r\ndifference of upwards of 20,000_l._ between the facts and figures of\r\nthe City Surveyor.\r\n\r\nIt would appear to me, therefore, that Mr. Haywood has erred, in\r\nestimating the probable expense of the street-orderly system of\r\nscavaging applied to the City at 52,000_l._ per annum, for, by his own\r\nshowing, it actually cost the authorities for the one year when it\r\nwas tried there, only 1529_l._ for 47,000 superficial yards, at which\r\nrate 770,000 yards could not cost more than 31,500_l._, and this, even\r\nallowing that the same amount of labour would be required for the\r\ncontinuous cleansing of the minor thoroughfares as was needed for the\r\nprincipal ones. That the error is an oversight on the part of the City\r\nSurveyor, the whole tone of his Report is sufficient to assure us, for\r\nit is at once moderate and candid.\r\n\r\nIt must, on the other hand, be admitted, that Mr. Haywood is perfectly\r\ncorrect as to the difference between the cost of the “demonstration”\r\nof the street-orderly system of cleansing in the City, and the\r\nestimated cost of that mode of scavaging when brought into regular\r\noperation there; this, however, the year’s experience of the City\r\n“daymen” shows, could not possibly exceed 32,000_l._, and might and\r\nprobably would be much less, when we take into account the smaller\r\nquantity of labour required for the minor thoroughfares--the extra\r\nvalue of the street manure when collected free from mud--the saving\r\nin the expense of watering the streets (this not being required under\r\nthe orderly system)--and the abolition of the daily scavaging, which\r\nis included in the sum above cited, but which would be no longer\r\nneeded were the orderlies employed, such work being performed by them\r\nat the commencement of their day’s labours; so that I am disposed to\r\nbelieve, all things considered, that somewhere about 20,000_l._ per\r\nannum might be the gross expense of continuously cleansing the City.\r\nMr. Cochrane estimates it at 18,000_l._ But whether the admitted\r\nsuperior cleanliness of the streets, and the employment of an extra\r\nnumber of people, will be held by the citizens to be worth the extra\r\nmoney, it is not for me to say. If, however, the increased cleanliness\r\neffected by the street-orderlies is to be brought about by a decrease\r\nof the wages of the regular scavagers from 16_s._ to 12_s._ a week,\r\nwhich is the amount upon which Mr. Cochrane forms his estimate, then\r\nI do not hesitate to say the City authorities will be gainers, in the\r\nmatter of poor-rates at least, by an adherence to the present method\r\nof scavaging, paying as they do the best wages, and indeed affording\r\nan illustrious example to all the metropolitan parishes, in refusing\r\nto grant contracts to any master scavagers but such as consent to deal\r\nfairly with the men in their employ. And I do hope and trust, for the\r\nsake of the working-men, the City Commissioners of Sewers will, should\r\nthey decide upon having the City cleansed _continuously_, make the same\r\nrequirement of Mr. Cochrane, before they allow his street-orderlies to\r\ndisplace the regular scavagers at present employed there.\r\n\r\nBenefits to the community, gained at the expense of “the people,”\r\nare really great evils. The street-orderly system is a good one when\r\napplied to parishes employing paupers and paying them 1_s._ 1-1/2_d._\r\nand a loaf per day, or even nothing, except their food, for their\r\nlabour. Here it elevates paupers into independent labourers; but,\r\napplied to those localities where the highest wages are paid, and there\r\nis the greatest regard shown for the welfare of the workmen, it is\r\nmerely a scurf-system of degrading the independent labourers to the\r\nlevel of paupers, by reducing the wages of the regular scavagers from\r\n16_s._ to 12_s._ per week. The avowed object of the street-orderly\r\nsystem is to provide employment for able-bodied men, and so to\r\n_prevent_ them becoming a _burthen to the parish_. But is not a\r\nreduction of the scavager’s wages to the extent of 25 per cent. a week,\r\nmore likely to _encourage_ than to _prevent_ such a result? This is\r\nthe weak point of the orderly system, and one which gentlemen calling\r\nthemselves _philanthropists_ should really blush to be parties to.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the opinion to which I am led is this--the street-orderly\r\nsystem is incomparably the best mode of scavaging, and the payment\r\nof the men by “_honourable_” masters the best mode of employing the\r\nscavagers. The evils of the scavaging trade appear to me to spring\r\nchiefly from the parsimony of the parish authorities--either employing\r\ntheir own paupers without adequate remuneration, or else paying such\r\nprices to the contractors as almost necessitates the under-payment of\r\nthe men in their employ. Were I to fill a volume, this is all that\r\ncould be said on the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “JET AND HOSE” SYSTEM OF SCAVAGING.\r\n\r\nThere appears at the present time a bent in the public mind for an\r\nimproved system of scavagery. Until the ravages of the cholera in\r\n1832, and again in 1848, roused the attention of Government and of\r\nthe country, men seemed satisfied to dwell in dirty streets, and to\r\ncongratulate themselves that the public ways were dirtier in the days\r\nof their fathers; a feeling or a spirit which has no doubt existed in\r\nall cities, from the days of those original scavagers, the vultures\r\nand hyenas of Africa and the East, the adjutants of Calcutta, and the\r\nhawks--the common glades or kites of this country--and which, we are\r\ntold, in the days of Henry VIII. used to fly down among the passengers\r\nto remove the offal of the butchers and poulterers’ stalls in the\r\nmetropolitan markets, and in consideration of which services it was\r\nforbidden to kill them--down to the mechanical sweeping of the streets\r\nof London, and even to Mr. Cochrane’s excellent street-orderlies.\r\n\r\nBesides the plan suggested by Mr. Cochrane, whose orderlies cleanse\r\nthe streets without wetting, and consequently without dirtying, the\r\nsurface by the use of the watering-cart, there is the opposite method\r\nproposed by Mr. Lee, of Sheffield, and other gentlemen, who recommend\r\nstreet-cleansing by the hose and jet, that is to say, by flushing\r\nthe streets with water at a high pressure, as the sewers are now\r\nflushed; and so, by _washing_ rather than _sweeping_ the dirt of the\r\nstreets into the sewers, through the momentum of the stream of water,\r\ndispensing altogether with the scavager’s broom, shovel, and cart.\r\n\r\nIn order to complete this account of the scavaging of the streets\r\nof London, I must, in conclusion, say a few words on this method,\r\nadvocated as it is by the Board of Health, and sanctioned by scientific\r\nmen. By the application of a hose, with a jet or water pipe attached\r\nto a fire-plug, the water being at high pressure, a stream of fluid is\r\nprojected along the street’s surface with force enough to _wash_ away\r\nall before it into the sewers, while by the same apparatus it can be\r\nthrown over the fronts of the houses. This mode of street-cleansing\r\nprevails in some American cities, especially in Philadelphia, where\r\nthe principal thoroughfares are said to be kept admirably clean by it;\r\nwhile the fronts of the houses are as bright as those in the towns\r\nof Holland, where they are washed, not by mechanical appliances, but\r\nby water thrown over them out of scoops by hand labour--one of the\r\ninstances of the minute and indefatigable industry of the Dutch.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in one of the Reports of the Board of Health, that\r\n“unless cleansing be general and simultaneous, much of the dirt of one\r\ndistrict is carried by traffic into another. By the subdivision of the\r\nmetropolis into small districts, the duty of cleansing the _public_\r\ncarriage-way is thrown upon a number of obscure and irresponsible\r\nauthorities; while the duty of cleansing the _public_ footways, which\r\nare no less important, _are_ charged upon multitudes of private\r\nindividuals.” [The grammar is the Board of Health’s grammar.] “It is\r\na false pecuniary economy, in the case of the poorest inhabitants of\r\ncourt or alley, who obtain their livelihood by any regular occupation,\r\nto charge upon each family the duty of cleansing the footway before\r\ntheir doors. The performance of this service daily, at a rate of 1_d._\r\n_per week_ per house or per family, would be an economy in soap and\r\nclothes to persons the average value of whose time is never less than\r\n2_d._ per hour.” [This is at the rate of 2_s._ a day; did this most\r\ninnocent Board _never_ hear of work yielding 1_s._ 6_d._ a week? But\r\nthe sanitary authorities seem to be as fond as teetotallers of “going\r\nto extremes.”]\r\n\r\nIn another part of the same Report the process and results are\r\ndescribed. It is also stated that for the success of this method of\r\nstreet purification the pavement must be good; for “a powerful jet,\r\napplied by the hose, would scoop out hollows in unpaved places, and\r\nalso loosen and remove the stones in those that are badly paved.”\r\nAs every public place ought to be well-paved, this necessity of new\r\nand good pavement is no reasonable objection to the plan, though it\r\ncertainly admits of a question as to the durability of the roads--the\r\nmacadamized especially--under this continual soaking. Sir Henry\r\nParnell, the great road authority, speaks of wet as the main destroyer\r\nof the highways.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the Report, after the mention of experiments having\r\nbeen made by Mr. Lovick, Mr. Hale, and Mr. Lee (Mr. Lee being one of\r\nthe engineering inspectors of the Board), that\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lovick, at the instance of the Metropolitan Commissioners of\r\nSewers, conducted his experiments with such jets as could be obtained\r\nfrom the water companies’ mains in eligible places; but the pressure\r\nwas low and insufficient. Nevertheless, it appeared that, taking the\r\nextra quantity of water required at the actual expense of pumping,\r\nthe paved surfaces might be washed clean at one-half the price of the\r\nscavagers’ manual labour in sweeping. Mr. Lee’s trials were made at\r\nSheffield, with the aid of a more powerful and suitable pressure, and\r\nhe found that with such pressure as he obtained the cleansing might be\r\neffected in one-third the time, and at one-third the usual expense,\r\nof the scavagers’ labour of sweeping the surface with the broom.”\r\n[This expense varies, and the Board nowhere states at what rate it is\r\ncomputed; the scavagers’ wages varying 100 per cent.]\r\n\r\n“The effect of this mode of cleansing in close courts and streets,” it\r\nis further stated, “was found to be peculiarly grateful in hot weather.\r\nThe water was first thrown up and diffused in a thin sheet, it was\r\nthen applied rapidly to cleansing the surface and the side walls, as\r\nwell as the pavements.” Mr. Lovick states that the immediate effect of\r\nthis operation was to lower the temperature, and to produce a sense of\r\nfreshness, similar to that experienced after a heavy thunder-shower\r\nin hot weather. But there is nothing said as to the probable effect\r\nof this state of things in winter--a hard frost for instance. The\r\nsame expedient was resorted to for cooling the yards and outer courts\r\nof hospitals, and the shower thrown on the windows of the wards\r\nafforded great relief. Mr. Lovick, in his Report on the trial works for\r\ncleansing courts, states:--\r\n\r\n“The importance of water as an agent in the improvement and\r\npreservation of health being in proportion to the unhealthiness or\r\ndepressed condition of districts, its application to close courts and\r\ndensely-populated localities, in which a low sanitary condition must\r\nobtain, is of primary importance. Having shown the practicability\r\nof applying this system (cleansing by jets of water) to the general\r\ncleansing of the streets, my further labours have been, and are now,\r\ndirected to this end.\r\n\r\n“For the purpose of ascertaining the effect produced by operations\r\nof this nature upon the atmosphere, two courts were selected:\r\nChurch-passage, New Compton-street, open at both ends, with\r\na carriage-way in the centre, and footway on each side; and\r\nLloyd’s-court, Crown-street, St. Giles’s, a close court, with, at one\r\nentrance, a covered passage about 40 feet in length: both courts were\r\nin a very filthy condition; in Church-passage there were dead decaying\r\ncats and fish, with offal, straw, and refuse scattered over the\r\nsurface; at one end an entrance to a private yard was used as a urinal;\r\nin every part there were most offensive smells.\r\n\r\n“Lloyd’s-court was in a somewhat similar condition, the covered\r\nentrance being used as a general urinal, presenting a disgusting\r\nappearance; the whole atmosphere of the court was loaded with\r\nhighly-offensive effluvia; in the covered entrance this was more\r\nparticularly discernible.\r\n\r\n“The property of water, as an absorbent, was rendered strikingly\r\napparent in the immediate and marked effects of its application, a\r\npurity and freshness remarkably contrasted to the former close and\r\nfoul condition prevailing throughout. A test of this, striking and\r\nunexpected, was the change at different periods in the relative\r\ncondition of atmosphere of the courts and of the contiguous streets. In\r\ntheir ordinary condition, as might have been expected, the atmosphere\r\nwas purer in the streets than in the courts; it was to be inferred that\r\nthe cleansing would have more nearly assimilated these conditions. This\r\nwas not only the case, but it was found to have effected a complete\r\nchange; the atmosphere of the courts at the close of the operations\r\nbeing far fresher and purer than the atmosphere of the streets. The\r\neffect produced was in every respect satisfactory and complete; and was\r\nthe theme of conversation with the lookers-on, and with the men who\r\nconducted the operations.\r\n\r\n“The expense of these operations, including water, would be, for--\r\n\r\n“Church-passage (time, five minutes), 1-1/2_d._\r\n\r\n“Lloyd’s-court (time, ten minutes), 3-1/4_d._\r\n\r\n“Mr. Hale, another officer, gave a similar statement.”\r\n\r\nOther experiments are thus detailed:--\r\n\r\n“Lascelles-court, Broad-street, St. Giles’s. This court was pointed\r\nout to me as one of the worst in London. Before cleansing it smelt\r\n_intolerable_,” [_sic_] “and looked disgusting. Besides an abundance\r\nof ordinary filth arising from the exposure of refuse, the surface\r\nof the court contained heaps of human excrement, there being only\r\none privy to the whole court, and that not in a state to be publicly\r\nused.... The cleansing operations were commenced by sprinkling the\r\ncourt with deodorising fluid, mixed with 20 times its volume of water;\r\na great change, from a very pungent odour to an imperceptible smell,\r\nwas immediately effected; after which the refuse of the court was\r\nwashed away, and the pavement thoroughly cleansed by the hose and jet;\r\nand now this place, which before was in a state almost indescribable,\r\npresented an appearance of comparative comfort and respectability.”\r\n\r\nIt is stated as the result of another experiment in “an ordinary wide\r\nstreet with plenty of traffic,” that “water-carts and ordinary rains\r\nonly create the mud which the jet entirely removes, giving to the\r\npavement the appearance of having been as thoroughly cleansed as the\r\nprivate stone steps in front of the houses.”\r\n\r\nWith respect to Mr. Lee’s experiments in Sheffield, I find that Messrs.\r\nGuest, of Rotherham, are patentees of a tap for the discharge of water\r\nat high pressures, and that they had adapted their invention to the\r\npurpose of a fire-plug and stand pipe suitable for street-cleansing by\r\nthe hose and jet. Church-street, one of the principal thoroughfares,\r\nwas experimentally cleansed by this process: “The carriage-way is from\r\n20 to 24 feet wide, and about 150 yards long. It was washed almost\r\nas clean as a house-floor in five minutes.” Mr. Lee expresses his\r\nconviction that, by the agency of the hose and jet, every street in\r\nthat populous borough might be cleansed at about 1_s._ per annum for\r\neach house. “The principal thoroughfares,” he states, “could be thus\r\nmade perfectly clean, three times every week, before business hours,\r\nand the minor streets and lanes twice, or once per week, at later hours\r\nin the day, by the agency of an abundant supply of water, at _less than\r\nhalf the sum necessary for the cartage alone_ of an equal quantity of\r\nrefuse in a solid or semi-fluid condition.”\r\n\r\nThe highways most frequented in Sheffield constitute about one-half of\r\nthe whole extent of the streets and roads in the borough, measuring 47\r\nmiles. This length, Mr. Lee computes, might be effectually cleansed\r\nwith the hose and jet, ten miles of it three times a week, 21 miles\r\ntwice a week, and 16 miles once a week, a total of 88 miles weekly, or\r\n4576 miles yearly. The quantity of Water required would be 3000 gallons\r\na mile, or a yearly total of 13,728,000 gallons. This water might be\r\nsupplied, Mr. Lee opines, at 1_d._ per 1000 gallons (57_l._ 4_s._ per\r\nannum), although the price obtained by the Water-works Company was\r\n6-1/2_d._ per 1000 gallons (371_l._ 16_s._ per annum). “I now proceed,”\r\nhe says, “to the cost of labour: 4576 miles per annum is equal to\r\n14-2/3 miles for each working day, or to six sets of two men cleansing\r\n2-1/2 miles per day each set. To these must be added three horses and\r\ncarts, and three carters, for the removal of such _débris_ as cannot be\r\nwashed away and for such parts of the town as cannot be cleansed by\r\nthis system, making a total of fifteen men. Their wages I would fix at\r\n50_l._ per annum each. The estimate is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “Annual interest upon the first cost\r\n    of hose and pipes, three horses and          £\r\n    carts                                        30\r\n  Fifteen men’s wages                           750\r\n  Three horses’ provender                       150\r\n  Wear, tear, and depreciation of hose, &c.     250\r\n  Management and incidentals, say               120\r\n                                              ------\r\n                                              £1300.”\r\n\r\nThe estimate, it will be seen, is based on the supposition that _the\r\nwater supply should be at the public cost_, and not a specific charge\r\nfor the purposes of street-cleansing.\r\n\r\nThe 47 miles of highway of Sheffield is but three miles less than those\r\nof the city of London, the cost of cleansing which is, according to the\r\nestimate before given, no less than 18,000_l._\r\n\r\nThe Sheffield account is divested of all calculations as to house-dust\r\nand ashes, and the charge for watering-carts; but, taking merely the\r\nsum paid to scavaging contractors, and assigning 1000_l._ (out of the\r\n2485_l._), as the proportion of salaries, &c., under the department of\r\nscavagery in the management of the City Commissioners, we find that\r\nwhile the expense of street-cleansing by the Sheffield hose and jet\r\nwas little more than 34_l._, in London, by the ordinary mode, it was\r\nupwards of 140_l._ per mile, or more than four times as much. The hose\r\nand jet system is said to have washed the streets of Sheffield as clean\r\nas a house-floor, which could not be said of it in London. The streets\r\nof the City, it should also be borne in mind, are now swept daily; Mr.\r\nLee proposes only a periodical cleaning for Sheffield, or once, twice,\r\nand thrice a week. Of the cost of the experiments made in London with\r\nthe hose and jet, in Lascelles-court, &c., nothing is said.\r\n\r\nStreet-cleansing by the hose and jet is, then, as yet but an\r\nexperiment. It has not, like the street-orderly mode, been tested\r\ncontinuously or systematically; but the experiments are so curious\r\nand sometimes so startling in their results that it was necessary to\r\ngive a brief account of them here, in order to render this account of\r\nthe cleansing of the streets of the metropolis as comprehensive as\r\npossible. For my own part, I must confess the street-orderly system\r\nappears to excel all other modes of scavagery, producing at once the\r\ngreatest cleanliness with the greatest employment to the poor. Nor am\r\nI so convinced as the theoretic and crotchety Board of Health as to\r\nthe healthfulness of dampness, or the daily evaporation of a sheet of\r\neven clean water equal in extent to the entire surface of the London\r\nstreets. It is certainly _doubtful_, to say the least, whether so much\r\nadditional moisture might _improve_ the public health, which the Board\r\nare instituted to protect; rain certainly contributes to cleanliness,\r\nand yet no one would advocate continued wet weather as a source of\r\ngeneral convalescence.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this account of the scavaging of London, with the\r\nfollowing brief statement as to the mode in which these matters are\r\nconducted abroad.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, where our system of parochial legislation and management\r\nis unknown, the scavaging of the streets--so frequently matters of\r\nprivate speculation with us--is under the immediate direction of the\r\nmunicipality, and the Government publish the returns, as they do of the\r\nrevenue of their capital from the abattoirs, the interments, and other\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nIn the _Moniteur_ for December 10, 1848, it is stated that the refuse\r\nof the streets of Paris sells for 500,500 francs (20,020_l._),\r\nwhen sold by auction in the mass; and 3,800,000 francs (equal to\r\n152,000_l._) when, after having lain in the proper receptacles, until\r\nfit for manure, it is sold by the cubic foot. In 1823, the streets\r\nof Paris were leased for 75,000 francs (3000_l._) per annum; in 1831\r\nthe value was 166,000 francs (6640_l._); and since 1845 the price\r\nhas risen to the sum first named, viz., 500,500 francs (20,020_l._);\r\nfrom which, however, is to be deducted the expense of cleansing, &c.\r\nI may add, that the receptacles alluded to are large places provided\r\nby Government, where the manure is deposited and left to ferment for\r\ntwelve or eighteen months.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COST AND TRAFFIC OF THE STREETS OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nI have, at page 183 of the present volume, given a brief statement of\r\nthe annual cost attending the keeping of the streets of the metropolis\r\nin working order.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the streets of a capital like London, the busiest in\r\nthe world--streets traversed daily by what Cowper, even in his day,\r\ndescribed as “the ten thousand wheels” of commerce--is an elaborate and\r\ncostly work.\r\n\r\nIn my former account I gave an estimate which referred to the amount\r\ndispensed weekly in wages for the labour of the workmen engaged in\r\nlaying down the paved roads of the metropolis. This was at the rate\r\nof 100,000_l._ per week; that is to say, calculating the operation of\r\nrelaying the streets to occupy one year in every five, there is no\r\nless than 5,200,000_l._ expended in that time among the workpeople\r\nso engaged. The sum expended in labour for the continued repairs of\r\nthe roads, after being so relaid, appears to be about 20,000_l._\r\nper week[30], or, in round numbers, about 1,000,000_l._ a year;\r\nso that the gross sum annually disbursed to the labourers engaged\r\nin the construction of the roads of London would seem to be about\r\n2,250,000_l._, that is to say, 1,000,000_l._ for repairing the old\r\nroads, and 1,250,000_l._ per annum for laying down new ones in their\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt now remains for me to set forth the gross cost of the metropolitan\r\nhighways, that is to say, the sum annually expended in both labour and\r\nmaterials, as well for relaying as for repairing the roads.\r\n\r\nThe granite-built streets cost, when relaid, about 11,000_l._ the\r\nmile, of ten yards’ width, which is at the rate of 12_s._ 6_d._ the\r\nsquare yard, materials and labour included, the granite (Aberdeen)\r\nbeing 1_l._ 5_s._ per ton, and one ton of “seven-inch” being sufficient\r\nto cover about three square yards.\r\n\r\nThe average cost of a macadamized road, materials and labour included,\r\nif constructed from the foundation, is about 4400_l._ per street mile\r\n(ten yards wide)--5_s._ the superficial yard being a fair price for\r\nmaterials and labour.\r\n\r\nWood pavement, on the other hand, costs about 9680_l._ a mile of ten\r\nyards’ width for materials and labour, which is at the rate of 11_s._\r\nthe superficial yard.\r\n\r\nThe cost of _repairs_, materials and labour included, is, for granite\r\npavement about 1-1/2_d._ per square yard, or 100_l._ the street mile of\r\nten yards wide; for “Macadam” it is from 6_d._ to 3_s._ 6_d._, or an\r\naverage of 1_s._ 6_d._ per superficial yard, which is at the rate of\r\n1320_l._ the street mile; while the wood pavement costs about the same\r\nfor repairs as the granite.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of repairing the streets of London, then, may be taken\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  Repairing granite-built streets, per          £\r\n    mile of ten yards wide                     100\r\n  Repairing macadamized roads, per\r\n    street mile                               1320\r\n  Repairing wood pavement, per street\r\n    mile                                       100\r\n\r\nOr, as a total for all London,--\r\n\r\n  Repairing 400 miles of granite-built\r\n    streets, at 100l. per mile              40,000\r\n  Repairing 1350 miles of macadamized\r\n    streets, at 1320l. per mile          1,782,000\r\n  Repairing five miles of wood, at\r\n    100_l._ per mile                           500\r\n                                        ----------\r\n                                        £1,822,500\r\n\r\nThe following, on the other hand, may be taken as the total cost of\r\n_reconstructing_ the London streets:--\r\n\r\n                                                     £\r\n  Granite-built streets, per mile ten yards wide  11,000\r\n  Macadamized streets, per street mile             4,400\r\n  Wood           „            „                    9,680\r\n\r\nOr, as a total for the entire streets and roads of London,--\r\n\r\n  Relaying 400 miles of granite-built                  £\r\n    streets, at 11,000_l._ per mile                4,400,000\r\n  Relaying 1350 miles of macadamized\r\n    streets, at 4400_l._ per mile                  5,940,000\r\n  Relaying five miles of wood-built\r\n    streets, at 9680_l._                              48,400\r\n                                                 -----------\r\n                                                 £10,388,400\r\n\r\nBut the above refers only to the road, and besides this, there is, as\r\na gentleman to whom I am much indebted for valuable information on\r\nthe subject, reminds me, the foot paving, granite curb, and granite\r\nchannel not included. The usual price for _paving_ is 8_d._ per foot\r\nsuperficial, when laid--granite curb 1_s._ 7_d._ per foot run, and\r\ngranite channel 12_s._ per square yard.\r\n\r\n“Now, presuming that three-fourths of the roads,” says my informant,\r\n“have paved footpaths on each side at an average width of six feet\r\nexclusive of curb, and that one-half of the macadamized roads have\r\ngranite channels on each side, and that one-third of all the roads\r\nhave granite curb on each side; these items for 400 miles of granite\r\nroad, 1350 macadamized, and 5 miles of wood--together 1755 miles--will\r\ntherefore amount to\r\n\r\n                                                £      _s._  _d._\r\n  Three-fourths of 1755 miles of\r\n    streets paved on each side,\r\n    six feet wide, at 8_d._ per foot\r\n    superficial                             2,779,392    0     0\r\n  One-half of 1350 miles of macadamized\r\n    roads with one foot\r\n    of granite channel on each\r\n    side, at 12_s._ per yard square           458,537    4     5\r\n  One-third of 1755 miles of road\r\n    with granite curb on each\r\n    side, at 1_s._ 7_d._ per foot run         489,060    0     0\r\n                                           ---------------------\r\n                                            3,726,989    4     5\r\n  Cost of constructing 1755 miles\r\n    of roadway                             10,388,400    0     0\r\n                                          ----------------------\r\n  Total cost of constructing the\r\n    streets of London                     £14,115,389    4     5\r\n\r\n“Accordingly the original cost of the metropolitan pavements exceeds\r\nfourteen millions sterling, and, calculating that this requires\r\nrenewal every five years, the gross annual expenditure will be at the\r\nrate of 2,500,000_l._ per annum, which, added to 1,822,500_l._, gives\r\n4,322,500_l._, or upwards of four millions and a quarter sterling for\r\nthe entire annual cost of the London roadways.\r\n\r\n“From rather extensive experience,” adds my informant, “in building\r\noperations, and consequently in making and paying for roads, I am of\r\nopinion that the amount I have shown is under rather than above the\r\nactual cost.\r\n\r\n“In a great many parts of the metropolis the roads are made by the\r\nservants of a body of Commissioners appointed for the purpose; and\r\nfrom dear-bought experience I can say they are a public nuisance, and\r\nwould earnestly caution speculating builders against taking building\r\nground or erecting houses in any place where the roads are under\r\ntheir control. The Commissioners are generally old retired tradesmen,\r\nand have very little to occupy their attention, and are often quite\r\nignorant of their duties; I have reason to believe, too, that some of\r\nthem even use their little authority to gratify their dislike to some\r\npoor builder in their district, by meddling and quibbling, and while\r\nthat is going on the houses which have been erected can neither be let\r\nnor sold; so that as the bills given for the materials keep running,\r\nthe builder, when they fall due, is ruined, for his creditors will not\r\ntake his unlet houses for their debts, and no one else will purchase\r\nthem until let, for none will rent them without proper accesses.\r\nI feel certain that in those parts where the roads are made by\r\nCommissioners three times more builders, in proportion to their number,\r\nget into difficulties than in the districts where they are permitted to\r\nmake the roads themselves.”\r\n\r\nThe paved ways and roads of London, then, it appears, cost in round\r\nnumbers 10,000,000_l._ sterling, and require nearly 2,000,000_l._ to be\r\nexpended upon them annually for repairs.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the sole expense attendant upon the construction of\r\nthe streets of the metropolis. Frequently, in the formation of new\r\nlines of thoroughfare, large masses of property have to be bought up,\r\nremoved, and new buildings erected at considerable cost. In a return\r\nmade pursuant to an order of the Court of Common Council, dated 23rd\r\nOctober, 1851, for “An account of all moneys which have been raised\r\nfor public works executed, buildings erected, or street improvements\r\neffected, out of the Coal Duties receivable by the Corporation of\r\nLondon in the character of trustees for administration or otherwise,\r\nsince the same were made chargeable by Parliament for such purposes in\r\nthe year 1766,” the following items are given relating to the cost of\r\nthe formation of new streets and improvements of old ones:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Street Improvements forming New Thoroughfares._\r\n\r\n                                                          Amount raised\r\n                                                            for Public\r\n                                                            Works, &c.\r\n  Building the bridge across the river                  £.     _s._  _d._\r\n    Thames, from Blackfriars, in the city\r\n    of London, to Upper Ground-street, in\r\n    the county of Surrey, now called\r\n    Blackfriars Bridge, and forming the\r\n    avenues thereto, and embanking the\r\n    north abutment of the said bridge--(Entrusted\r\n    to the Corporation of the\r\n    city of London)                                    210,000   0     0\r\n\r\n  Making a new line of streets from Moorfields,\r\n    opposite Chiswell-street, towards\r\n    the east into Bishopsgate-street\r\n    (now Crown-street and Sun-street),\r\n    also from the east end of Chiswell-street\r\n    westward into Barbican--(Corporation\r\n    of the city of London)                              16,500   0     0\r\n\r\n  Making a new street from Crispin-street,\r\n    near Spitalfields Church, into Bishopsgate-street\r\n    (now called Union-street),\r\n    in the city of London and in the\r\n    county of Middlesex--(Commissioners\r\n    named in Act 18, George III., c. 78)                 9,000    0    0\r\n\r\n  Opening communications between Wapping-street\r\n    and Ratcliffe-highway, and\r\n    between Old Gravel-lane and Virginia-street,\r\n    all in the county of Middlesex--(Commissioners\r\n    appointed under Act 17, Geo.

The point of greatest traffic in the\r\nCity is London-bridge, where the conveyances passing and repassing\r\namount to 13,099 in the course of twelve hours[31]. Of these it would\r\nappear, that 9351 consist of one-horse vehicles and equestrians, 3389\r\nof two-horse conveyances, and only 359 of vehicles drawn by more than\r\ntwo horses. The one-horse vehicles would seem to be between two and\r\nthree times as many as the two-horse, which form about one-fourth of\r\nthe whole, while those drawn by more than two horses constitute about\r\none-sixtieth of the entire number.\r\n\r\nThe Return does not mention the state of the weather on the several\r\ndays and hours at which the observations were made, nor does it\r\ntell us whether there was any public event occurring on those days\r\nwhich was likely to swell or diminish the traffic beyond its usual\r\nproportions. The table, moreover, it should be remembered, is confined\r\nto the observations of only one day in each locality, so that we must\r\nbe guarded in receiving that which records a mere accidental set of\r\ncircumstances as an example of the general course of events. It would\r\nhave been curious to have extended the observations throughout the\r\nnight, and so have ascertained the difference in the traffic; and also\r\nto have noted the decrease in the number of vehicles passing during a\r\ncontinuously wet as well as a showery day. The observations should be\r\nfurther carried out to different seasons, in order to be rendered of\r\nthe highest value. Mr. Haywood and the City authorities would really be\r\nconferring a great boon on the public by so doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE RUBBISH CARTERS.\r\n\r\nThe public cleansing trade, I have before said, consists of as many\r\ndivisions as there are distinct species of refuse to be removed, and\r\nthese appear to be four. There is the _house_-refuse, consisting of\r\ntwo different kinds, as (1) the wet house-refuse or “slops,” and\r\n“night-soil,” and (2) the dry house-refuse, or dust and soot; and there\r\nis the _street_-refuse, also consisting of two distinct kinds, as (3)\r\nthe wet street-refuse, or mud and dirt; and (4) the dry street-refuse\r\nor “rubbish.”\r\n\r\nI now purpose dealing with the labourers engaged in the collection and\r\nremoval of the last-mentioned kind of refuse.\r\n\r\nTechnologically there are several varieties of “rubbish,” or rather\r\n“_dirt_,” for such appears to be the generic term, of which “rubbish”\r\nis _strictly_ a species. Dirt, according to the understanding among\r\nthe rubbish-carters, would seem to consist of any solid earthy matter,\r\nwhich is of an useless or refuse character. This dirt the trade divides\r\ninto two distinct kinds, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. “Soft dirt,” or refuse clay (of which “dry dirt,” or refuse soil or\r\nmould, is a variety).\r\n\r\n2. “Hard-dirt,” or “hard-core,” consisting of the refuse bricks,\r\nchimney-pots, slates, &c., when a house is pulled down, as well as the\r\nbroken bottles, pans, pots, or crocks, and oyster-shells, &c., which\r\nform part of the contents of the dustman’s cart.\r\n\r\nThe phrase “hard-core”[32] seems strictly to mean all such refuse\r\nmatter as will admit of being used as the foundation of roads,\r\nbuildings, &c. “Rubbish,” on the other hand, appears to be limited, by\r\nthe trade, to “dry dirt;” out of the trade, however, and etymologically\r\nspeaking, it signifies all such _dry_ and _hard_ refuse matter as is\r\nrendered useless by wear and tear[33]. The term _dirt_, on the other\r\nhand, is generally applied to _soft_ refuse matter, and _dust_ to\r\n_dry_ refuse matter in a state of minute division, while _slops_ is\r\nthe generic term for all _wet_ or _liquid_ refuse matter. I shall here\r\nrestrict the term rubbish to all that dry and hard refuse matter which\r\nis the residuum of certain worn-out or “used-up” earthen commodities,\r\nas well as the surplus earth which is removed whenever excavations are\r\nmade, either for the building of houses, the cutting of railways, the\r\nlevelling of roads, the laying down of pipes or drains, and the sinking\r\nof wells.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREET TRAFFIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND HORSES PASSING THROUGH CERTAIN\r\nTHOROUGHFARES WITHIN THE CITY OF LONDON, BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 8 A.M.\r\nAND 8

nature. Such commodities as\r\nare made of _fibrous_ or _textile_ materials, go, when “used up,”\r\nchiefly to form manure if of an animal nature, and to be converted\r\ninto paper if of a vegetable origin. The refuse materials of our\r\nwoollen clothes, our old coats and trousers, are either torn to pieces\r\nand re-manufactured into shoddy, or become the invigorators of our\r\nhop and other plants; whereas those of our linen or cotton garments,\r\nour old shirts and petticoats, form the materials of our books and\r\nletters; while our old ropes, &c., are converted into either brown\r\npaper or oakum. Those commodities, on the other hand, which are made\r\nof _leathern_ materials, become, when worn out, the ingredients of the\r\nprussiate of potash and other nitrogenised products manufactured by our\r\nchemists. Our old _wooden_ commodities, again, are used principally to\r\nkindle our fires; while the refuse of our fires themselves, whether the\r\nsoot which is deposited in the chimney above, or the ashes which fall\r\nbelow, are employed mainly to increase the fertility of our land. Our\r\nworn-out _metal_ commodities, on the other hand, are newly melted, and\r\ngo to form fresh commodities when the metals are of the scarcer kind,\r\nas gold, silver, copper, brass, lead, and even iron; and when of the\r\nmore common kind, as is the case with old tin, and occasionally iron\r\nvessels, they either become the ingredients in some of our chemical\r\nmanufactures, or else when formed of tin are cut up into smaller and\r\ninferior commodities. Even the detritus of our _streets_ is used as\r\nthe soil of our market gardens. All this we have already seen, and\r\nwe have now to deal more particularly with the refuse of the\r\nsole remaining materials, viz., those of an _earthy_ kind, and out\r\nof which are made our bricks, our earthenware and porcelain, as well\r\nas our glass, plaster, and stone commodities. What becomes of all\r\nthese materials when the articles made of them are no longer fit for\r\nuse? The old glass is, like the old metal, re-melted and made into\r\nnew commodities; some broken bottles are used for the tops of walls\r\nas a protection against trespassers; and the old bricks, when sound,\r\nare employed again for inferior brick-work; but what becomes of the\r\nrest of the earthen materials--the unsound bricks or “bats,” the old\r\nplaster and mortar, the refuse slates and tiles and chimney-pots, the\r\nbroken pans, and dishes, and other crocks--in a word, the potsherds\r\nand pansherds[34], as the rubbish-carters call them--what is done with\r\nthese?\r\n\r\nBut rubbish, as we have seen, consists not only of refuse earthen\r\ncommodities, but of refuse earth itself: such as the soil removed\r\nduring excavations for the foundations of houses, for the cuttings of\r\nrailways, the levelling of roads, the formation of parks, the laying\r\ndown of pipes or drains, and the sinking of wells. For each and all\r\nof these operations there is necessarily a certain quantity of soil\r\nremoved, and the question that naturally occurs to the mind is, what is\r\ndone with it?\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, a third kind of rubbish, which, though having an\r\nanimal origin, consists chiefly of earthy matter, and that is the\r\nshells of oysters, and other shell-fish. Whence go they, since these\r\nshells are of a comparatively indestructible nature, and thousands of\r\nsuch fish are consumed annually in the metropolis? What, the inquirer\r\nasks, becomes of the refuse bony coverings of such fish?\r\n\r\nLet us first, however, endeavour to estimate what quantity of each of\r\nthese three kinds of rubbish is annually produced in London, beginning\r\nwith the refuse earthen commodities.\r\n\r\nThere is no published account of the quantity of _crockeryware_\r\nannually manufactured in this country. Mr. McCulloch tells us, “It\r\nis estimated, that the _value_ of the various sorts of earthenware\r\nproduced at the potteries may amount to about 1,700,000_l._ or\r\n1,800,000_l._ a year; and that the earthenware produced at Worcester,\r\nDerby, and other parts of the country, may amount to about 850,000_l._\r\nor more, making the whole value of the manufacture 2,550,000_l._ or\r\n2,650,000_l._ a year.” What proportion of this quantity may fall to\r\nthe share of the metropolis, and what proportion of the whole may be\r\nannually destroyed, I know of no means of judging. We must therefore go\r\nsome other way to work in order to arrive at the required information.\r\nNow, it has been before shown, that the quantity of “dust,” or dry\r\nrefuse from houses, annually collected, amounts to 900,000 tons or\r\nchaldrons yearly; and I find, on inquiry at the principal “yards,” that\r\nthe average quantity of Potsherds and broken crockery is at the rate\r\nof about half a bushel to every load of dust, or say 1 per cent. out of\r\nthe entire quantity collected. At other yards, I find the proportion\r\nof sherds to be about the same, so that we may fairly assume that the\r\ngross quantity of broken earthenware produced in London is in round\r\nnumbers 9000 loads or tons per annum. The sherds run about 250 pieces\r\nto the bushel, and assuming every five of such pieces to be the remains\r\nof an entire article, there would be in each bushel the fragments of\r\nfifty earthenware vessels; and thus the total quantity of crockeryware\r\ndestroyed yearly in the metropolis will amount to 18,000,000 vessels.\r\n\r\nAs to the quantity of _refuse bricks_, the number annually produced,\r\nwhich is between 1,500,000,000 and 2,000,000,000, will give us no\r\nknowledge of the quantity yearly converted into rubbish. In order to\r\narrive at this, we must ascertain the number of houses pulled down\r\nin the course of the twelvemonth; and I find, by the Returns of the\r\nRegistrar-General, that the buildings removed between 1841 and 1851\r\nhave been as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nDECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HOUSES THROUGHOUT LONDON BETWEEN 1841 AND\r\n1851.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+-----------+---------\r\n                              |   Total   |  Annual\r\n                              |Decrease in| Average\r\n                              | 10 Years. |Decrease.\r\n  ----------------------------+-----------+---------\r\n  St. Martin’s                |    116    |  11·6\r\n  St. James’s, Westminster    |    130    |  13·0\r\n  St. Giles’s                 |    181    |  18·1\r\n  Strand                      |    389    |  38·9\r\n  Holborn                     |     86    |   8·6\r\n  East London                 |     11    |   1·1\r\n  West London                 |    265    |  26·5\r\n  London, City of             |    592    |  59·2\r\n  Whitechapel                 |      2    |    ·2\r\n  St. Saviour’s, Southwark    |     46    |   4·6\r\n  St. Olave’s                 |    158    |  15·8\r\n  ----------------------------+-----------+---------\r\n             Total            |   1976    | 197·6\r\n  ----------------------------+-----------+---------\r\n\r\nThus, then, we perceive that there have been, upon an average, very\r\nnearly 200 houses annually pulled down in London within the last ten\r\nyears, and I find, on inquiry among those who are likely to be the\r\nbest-informed on such matters, that each house so pulled down will\r\nyield from 40 to 50 loads of rubbish; so that, altogether, the quantity\r\nof refuse bricks, slates, tiles, chimney-pots, &c., annually produced\r\nin London must be no less than 8000 loads.\r\n\r\nBut the above estimate refers only to those houses which have been\r\npulled down and never rebuilt; so that, in order to arrive at the gross\r\nquantity of this kind of rubbish yearly produced in the metropolis,\r\nwe must add to the preceding amount the quantity accruing from such\r\nhouses as are pulled down and built up again, or newly fronted and\r\nrepaired, which are by far the greater number. These, I find, may be\r\nestimated at between 5 and 10 per cent. of the gross number of houses\r\nin the metropolis. In some quarters (the older parts of London, for\r\ninstance,) the proportion is much higher, while in the suburbs, or\r\nnewer districts, it is scarcely half per cent. Each of the houses so\r\nnew-fronted or repaired may be said to yield, on an average, 10 loads\r\nof rubbish, and, at this rate, the yearly quantity of refuse bricks,\r\nmortar, &c., proceeding from such a source, will be 150,000 loads per\r\nannum; so that the total amount of rubbish produced in London by the\r\ndemolition and reparation of houses would appear to be about 160,000\r\nloads yearly.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of refuse _oyster shells_ may easily be found by the\r\nnumber of oysters annually sold in Billingsgate-market. These, from\r\nthe returns which I obtained from the market salesmen, and printed\r\nat p. 63 of the first volume of this work, appear to be, in round\r\nnumbers, 500,000,000; and, calculating that one-third of this quantity\r\nis sent into the country, the total number of shells remaining in the\r\nmetropolis may be estimated at about 650,000,000. Reckoning, then, that\r\n500 shells go to the bushel (the actual number was found experimentally\r\nto be between 525 and 550), and consequently that 20,000 are contained\r\nin every load, we may conclude that the gross quantity of refuse oyster\r\nshells annually produced in London average somewhere about 30,000\r\nloads. That this is an approximation to the true quantity there can be\r\nlittle doubt, for, on inquiry at one of the largest dust-yards, I was\r\ninformed by the hill-man that the quantity of oyster-shells collected\r\nwith the refuse dust from houses in the vicinity of Shoreditch,\r\nWhitechapel, and other localities at the east-end of the metropolis,\r\naverages 6 bushels to the load of dust; about the west-end, however,\r\nhalf a bushel or a bushel to each load is the average ratio; while\r\nfrom the City there is none, the house “dust” there being free from\r\noyster-shells. In taking one district, however, with another, I am\r\nassured that the average may be safely computed at 2 bushels of\r\noyster-shells to every 3 loads of dust; hence, as the gross amount of\r\nhouse-dust is equal to 900,000 tons or loads per annum, the quantity of\r\nrefuse oyster-shells collected yearly by the dustmen may be taken at\r\n15,000 loads. But, besides these, there is the quantity got rid of by\r\nthe costermongers, which seldom or never appear in the dust-bins. The\r\ncosters sell about 124,000,000 oysters per annum, and thus the extra\r\nquantity of shells resulting from these means would be about 12,400\r\nloads; so that the gross quantity of refuse oyster-shells actually\r\nproduced in London may be said to average between 25,000 and 30,000\r\nloads per annum.\r\n\r\nThere still remains the quantity of _refuse earth_ to be calculated;\r\nthis may be estimated as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. _Foundations of Houses._--Each house that is built requires the\r\nground to be excavated from two to three yards deep, the average area\r\nof each being about nine yards square. This gives between 160 and 200\r\ncubic yards of earth removed from the foundation of each house. A cubic\r\nyard of earth is a load, so that there are between 160 and 200 loads of\r\nearth displaced in the building of every new house.\r\n\r\nThe following statement shows--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NUMBER OF HOUSES BUILT THROUGHOUT LONDON BETWEEN 1841 AND 1851.\r\n\r\n  --------------------+---------------+-----------\r\n                      |   Total No.   |  Average\r\n                      |   of Houses   |  No. of\r\n                      |  built in 10  |  Houses\r\n                      |    Years.     | built per\r\n                      |               |   Year.\r\n  --------------------+---------------+-----------\r\n  West Districts      |     9,624     |  962·4\r\n  North Districts     |    13,778     | 1377·8\r\n  Central Districts   |       349     |   34·9\r\n  East Districts      |     8,343     |  834·3\r\n  South Districts     |    14,807     | 1480·7\r\n  --------------------+---------------+-----------\r\n             Total    |   46,901      | 4690·1\r\n  --------------------+---------------+-----------\r\n\r\nHence, estimating the number of new houses built yearly in the\r\nmetropolis at 4500, the total quantity of earth removed for the\r\nfoundations of the buildings throughout London would be 800,000 loads\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\n2. _The Cuttings of Railways._--The railways formed within the area of\r\nthe metropolis during the last ten years have been--the Great Northern;\r\nthe Camden Town, and Bow; the West India Docks and Bow; and the North\r\nKent Lines. The extension of the Southampton Railway from Vauxhall to\r\nWaterloo-bridge, as well as the Richmond Line, has also been formed\r\nwithin the same period, but for these no cuttings have been made.\r\n\r\nThe Railway Cuttings made within the area of the Metropolis Proper\r\nduring the last ten years have been to the following extent:--\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+--------+-----------------+--------+---------\r\n                          | Length |Width of Cutting.| Depth  |Quantity\r\n         RAILWAYS.        |   of   +---------+-------+   of   |of earth\r\n                          |Cutting.|   At   |   At   |Cutting.|Removed.\r\n                          |        |  top.  | bottom.|        |\r\n  ------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n                          | Miles. | Yards. | Yards. | Yards. |  Loads.\r\n  Great Northern          | 1-1/2  |   12   |   10   |   10   | 290,400\r\n  Camden Town and Bow     | 1-1/2  |   12   |   10   |   10   | 290,400\r\n  West India Docks and Bow| 2      |   15   |   10   |   12   | 528,000\r\n  North Kent              | 2      |   15   |   10   |   12   | 528,000\r\n  ------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n\r\nHence, the gross quantity of earth removed from railway cuttings within\r\nthe last ten years has been 1,636,800 loads, or say, in round numbers,\r\n160,000 loads per annum.\r\n\r\n3. _The Cutting of Roads and Streets._--According to a Return presented\r\nto Parliament, there were 200 miles of new streets formed within the\r\nmetropolitan police district between the years 1839-49; but in the\r\nformation of these no earth has been taken away; on the contrary a\r\nconsiderable quantity has been required for their construction. In the\r\ncase of the lowering of Holborn-hill, that which was removed from the\r\ntop was used to fill up the hollow.\r\n\r\n4. _The Formation of Parks._--The only park that has been constructed\r\nduring the last ten years in the metropolis is Victoria Park, at the\r\neast end of the town; but I am informed that, in the course of the\r\nworks there, no earth was carted away, the soil which was removed from\r\none part being used for the levelling of another.\r\n\r\n5. _Pipe and Sewer Works._--The earth displaced in the course of these\r\noperations is usually put back into the ground whence it was taken,\r\nexcepting in the formation of some new sewer, and then a certain\r\nproportion has to be carted away. Upon inquiry among those who are\r\nlikely to be best informed, I am assured that 1000 loads may be taken\r\nas the quantity carted away in the course of the last year.\r\n\r\n6. _Well-sinking._--In this there has been but little done. Those who\r\nare best informed assure me that within the last ten years no such\r\nworks of any magnitude have been executed.\r\n\r\nThe account as to the quantity of rubbish removed in London, then,\r\nstands thus:--\r\n\r\n                                              Loads\r\n  _Refuse Earthen Materials._               per Annum.\r\n    Potsherds and Pansherds                      9,000\r\n    Old bricks, tiles, slates, mortar, &c.     160,000\r\n    Oyster-shells                               25,000\r\n\r\n  _Refuse Earth._\r\n    Foundations of houses                      800,000\r\n    Railway cuttings                           160,000\r\n    Pipe and sewer laying                        1,000\r\n                                             ---------\r\n                                             1,155,000\r\n\r\nThus, then, we perceive that the gross quantity of rubbish that has to\r\nbe annually removed throughout the metropolis is upwards of 1,000,000\r\nloads per annum.\r\n\r\nNow what is done with the vast amount of refuse matter? Whither is it\r\ncarried? How is it disposed of?\r\n\r\n_The rubbish from the house building or removing_ is of no value to the\r\nmaster carter, and is shot gratuitously wherever there is the privilege\r\nof shooting it; this privilege, however, is very often usurped. Great\r\nquantities used to be shot in what were, until these last eight years,\r\nBishop Bonner’s Fields, but now Victoria Park. At the present time this\r\nsort of rubbish is often slily deposited in localities generally known\r\nas “the ruins,” being places from which houses, and indeed streets,\r\nhave been removed, and the sites left bare and vacant.\r\n\r\nBut the main localities for the deposition of this kind of refuse are\r\nin the fields round about the metropolis. Each particular district\r\nappears to have its own special “shoot,” as it is called, for rubbish,\r\nof which the following are the principal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rubbish shoots._\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Kensington and Chelsea is shot in the Pottery Grounds\r\n and Kensington-fields.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of St. George’s Hanover-square, Marylebone, and\r\n Paddington, is shot in the fields about Notting-hill and Kilburn.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Westminster, Strand, Holborn, St. Martin’s, St.\r\n Giles’s, St. James’s, Westminster, West London, and Southwark, is shot\r\n in Cubitt’s fields at Millbank and Westminster improvements.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Hampstead is shot in the fields at back of\r\n Haverstock-hill.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Saint Pancras is shot in the Copenhagen-fields.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Islington, Clerkenwell, and St. Luke’s, is shot in the\r\n Eagle Wharf-road and Shepherdess-fields.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of East London and City is shot in the Haggerstone-fields.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Whitechapel, St. George’s in the East, and Stepney, is\r\n shot in Stepney fields.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Hackney, Bethnal-green, and Shoreditch, is shot in the\r\n Bonkers-pond, Hackney-road.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Poplar is shot in the fields at back of New Town,\r\n Poplar.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Bermondsey is shot in the Bermondsey fields.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Newington, Camberwell, and Lambeth, is shot in\r\n Walworth-common and Kennington-fields.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Wandsworth is shot in Potters-hole, Wandsworth-common.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Greenwich and Lewisham is shot in Russia-common, near\r\n Lewisham.\r\n\r\n The rubbish of Rotherhithe is used for ballast.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of rubbish annually shot in each of the above-mentioned\r\nlocalities appears to range from 5000 up to as high as 30,000 and\r\n40,000 loads.\r\n\r\nOf the earth removed in forming the foundation of new houses, between\r\none-fourth and one-sixth of the whole is used to make the gardens at\r\nthe back, and the bed of the roads in front of them, while the entire\r\nquantity of the soil displaced in the execution of the “cuttings”\r\nof railways is carted away in the trucks of the company to form\r\nembankments in other places. Hence there would appear to be about from\r\n160,000 to 200,000 loads of refuse bricks, potsherds, pansherds, and\r\noyster-shells, and about 600,000 loads of refuse earth deposited every\r\nyear in the fields or “shoots” in the vicinity of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe refuse earth displaced in forming the foundations of houses is\r\ngenerally carted away by the builders’ men, so that it is principally\r\nthe refuse bricks, &c., that the rubbish-carters are engaged in\r\nremoving; these they usually carry to the shoots already indicated, or\r\nto such other localities where the hard core may be needed for forming\r\nthe foundation of roads, or the rubbish be required for certain other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe principal _use to which the “rubbish” is put_ is for levelling,\r\nwhen the hollow part of any newly-made road has to be filled up, or\r\ngarden or lawn ground has to be levelled for a new mansion. Rubbish, at\r\none time, was in demand for the ballasting of small coasting vessels.\r\nFor such ballasting 2_d._ a ton has to be paid to the corporation\r\nof the Trinity House. This rubbish has been used, but sometimes\r\nsurreptitiously, for ballast, unmixed with other things. It is,\r\nhowever, light and inferior ballast, and occupies more space than the\r\ngravel ballast from the bed of the Thames.\r\n\r\nSuppose that a collier requires ballast to the extent of 60 tons; if\r\nhouse rubbish be used it will occupy the hold to a greater height\r\nby about 10 inches than would the ballast derived from the bed of\r\nthe Thames. The Thames ballast is supplied at 1_s._ a ton; the\r\nrubbish-ballast, however, was only 3_d._ to 6_d._ a ton, but now it\r\nis seldom used unless to mix with manure, which might be considered\r\ntoo wet and soft, and likely to ferment on the voyage to a degree\r\nunpleasant even to the mariners used to such freights. The rubbish, I\r\nam told, checks the fermentation, and gives consistency to the manure.\r\n\r\nI am assured by a tradesman, who ships a considerable quantity of\r\nstable manure collected from the different mews of the metropolis,\r\nthat comparatively little rubbish is now used for ballast (unless in\r\nthe way I have stated); even for mixing, but a few tons a week are\r\nrequired up and down the river, and perhaps a small quantity from the\r\nwharfs on the several canals. Nothing was ever paid for the use of\r\nthis rubbish as ballast, the carters being well satisfied to have the\r\nprivilege of shooting it. Two of the principal shoots by the river side\r\nwere at Bell-wharf, Shadwell, and off Wapping-street. The rubbish of\r\nRotherhithe, it will be seen, is mainly “shot” as ballast.\r\n\r\nThe “_hard-core_” is readily got rid of; sometimes it is shot\r\ngratuitously (or merely with a small gratuity for beer to the men);\r\nbut if it have to be carted three or four miles, it is from 2_s._\r\n6_d._ to 3_s._ a load. This is used for the foundations of houses,\r\nthe groundwork of roads, and other purposes where a hard substratum\r\nis required. The hard-core on a new road is usually about nine inches\r\ndeep. There are on an average 20 miles of streets, 15 yards wide,\r\nformed annually in London. Hence there would be upwards of 100,000\r\nloads of hard-core required for this purpose alone. Where the soil is\r\nof a gravelly nature, but little hard rubbish is needed. Oyster-shells\r\n_did_ form a much greater portion than they do now of the hard\r\nsubstratum of roads. Eight or nine years ago the costermongers could\r\nsell their oyster-shells for 6_d._ a bushel. Now they cannot, or do\r\nnot, sell them at all; and the law not only forbids their deposit in\r\nany place whatever, but forbids their being scattered in the streets,\r\nunder a penalty of 5_l._ But as the same law provides no place where\r\nthese shells may be deposited, the costermongers are in what one of\r\nthem described to me as “a quandary.” One man, who with his wife kept\r\ntwo stalls in Tottenham Court-road, one for fish (fresh and dried) and\r\nfor shell-fish, and the other for fruit and vegetables, told me that\r\nhe gave “one of those poor long-legged fellows who were neither men nor\r\nboys, and who were always starving and hanging about for a two-penny\r\njob, two-pence to carry away a hamper-full of shells and get rid of\r\nthem as he best could. O, where he put them, sir,” said the man, “I\r\ndon’t know, I wouldn’t know; and I shouldn’t have mentioned it to you,\r\nonly I saw you last winter and know you’re inquiring for an honest\r\npurpose.”\r\n\r\nAnother costermonger who has a large barrow of oysters and mussels,\r\nand sometimes of “wet fish” near King’s-cross, and at the junction of\r\nLeather-lane with Back-hill, Hatton-garden, was more communicative: “If\r\nyou’ll walk on with me, sir,” he said, “_I’ll_ show you where they’re\r\nshot. You may mention my name if you like, sir; I don’t care a d----\r\nfor the crushers; not a blessed d----.” He accordingly conducted me\r\nto a place which seemed adapted for the special purpose. At the foot\r\nof Saffron-hill and the adjacent streets runs the Fleet-ditch, now\r\na branch of the common sewers; not covered over as in other parts,\r\nbut open, noisome, and, as the dark water flows on, throwing up a\r\nsickening stench. The ditch is indifferently fenced, so that any one\r\nwith a little precaution may throw what he pleases into it. “There,\r\nsir,” said my companion, “there’s the place where more oyster-shells\r\nis thrown than anywhere in London. They’re thrown in in the dark.”\r\nAssuredly the great share of blame is not to those who avail themselves\r\nof such places for illegal purposes, but to those who leave such\r\nfilthy receptacles available. The scattered oyster-shells along all\r\nthe approaches, on both sides, to this part of the open Fleet-ditch,\r\nevince the use that is made of it in violation of the law. Many of the\r\ncosters, however, keep the shells by them till they amount to several\r\nbushels, and then give the rubbish-carters a few pence to dispose of\r\nthem for them.\r\n\r\nSome of the costermongers, again, obtain leave to deposit their\r\noyster-shells in the dustmen’s yards, where quantities may be seen\r\nwhitening the dingy dust-heaps, and a large quantity are collected with\r\nthe house-dust and ashes, together with the broken crockery from the\r\ndust-bins of the several houses. The oyster-shells are carted away with\r\nthe pansherds, &c., for the purposes I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI now come to deal with the rubbish-carters, that is to say, with the\r\nlabourers engaged in the removal of the “hard” species of refuse;\r\nof which we have seen there are between 160,000 and 200,000 loads\r\nannually carted away; the refuse earth, or “soft dirt,” being generally\r\nremoved by the builders’ men, and the refuse, crockeryware, &c., by the\r\ndustmen, when collecting the dust from the “bins” of the several houses.\r\n\r\nThe master _Rubbish-Carters_ are those who keep carts and horses to\r\nbe hired for carting away the old materials when houses or walls are\r\npulled down. They are also occasionally engaged in carrying away the\r\nsoil or rubbish thrown up from the foundations of buildings; the\r\nexcavations of docks, canals, and sewers; the digging of artesian\r\nwells, &c. This seems to comprise what in this carrying or removing\r\ntrade is accounted “rubbish.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps not one of these tradesmen is solely a rubbish-carter, for they\r\nare likewise the carters of new materials for the use of builders,\r\nsuch as lime, bricks, stone, gravel, slates, timber, iron-work,\r\nchimney-pieces, &c. Some of them are public carmen; licensed carmen\r\nif they work, or ply, in the City; but beyond the City boundaries no\r\nlicence is necessary. This complication perplexes the inquiry, but I\r\npurpose to confine it, as much as possible, to the rubbish-carters\r\nproper, having defined what may be understood by “rubbish.” These\r\ncarters are also employed in digging, pick-axing, &c., at the\r\nbuildings, the rubbish of which they are engaged to remove.\r\n\r\nAmong the conveyors of rubbish are no distinctions as to the kind.\r\nAny of them will one week cart old bricks from a house which has been\r\npulled down, and the next week be busy in removing the soil excavated\r\nwhere the foundations and cellars of a new mansion have been dug.\r\n\r\nFrom inquiries made in each of the different districts of the\r\nmetropolis, there appear to be from 140 to 150 tradesmen who, with the\r\ncarting of bricks, lime, and other building commodities, add also that\r\nof rubbish-carting. These “masters” among them find employment for 840\r\nlabouring men, some of whom I find to have been in the service of the\r\nsame employer upwards of 20 years.\r\n\r\nThe Post-Office Directory, under the head of rubbish-carters, gives\r\nthe names of only 35 of the principal masters, of whom several are\r\nmarked as scavagers, dust-contractors, nightmen, and road-contractors.\r\nThe occupation abstract of the census, on the other hand, totally\r\nignores the existence of any such class of workmen, masters as well\r\nas operatives. I find, however, by actual visitation and inquiry in\r\neach of the metropolitan districts, and thus learning the names of the\r\nseveral masters as well as the number of men in their employment, that\r\nthere may be said to be, in round numbers, 150 master rubbish-carters,\r\nemploying among them 840 operatives throughout London.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of this number of labouring men, however, are\r\ncasual hands, who have been taken on when the trade was busy during\r\nthe summer (which is the “brisk season” of rubbish-cartage), and who\r\nare discharged in the slack time; during which period they obtain jobs\r\nat dust-carting or scavaging, or some such out-door employment. Among\r\nthe employers there are scarcely any who are purely rubbish-carters,\r\nthe large majority consisting of dust and road-contractors, carmen,\r\ndairymen, and persons who have two or three horses and carts at their\r\ndisposal. When a master builder or bricklayer obtains a contract, he\r\nhires horses and carts to take away any rubbish which may previously\r\nhave been deposited. The contract of the King’s Cross Terminus of\r\nthe Great Northern Railway, for instance, has been undertaken by Mr.\r\nW. Jay, the builder; and, not having sufficient conveyances to cart\r\nthe rubbish away, he has hired horses and carts of others to assist\r\nin the removal of it. The same mode is adopted in other parts of the\r\nmetropolis, where any improvements are going on. The owners of horses\r\nand carts let them out to hire at from 7_s._ for one horse, to 14_s._\r\nfor two per day. If, however, the job be unusually large, the master\r\nrubbish-carters often take it by contract themselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough the _operative rubbish-carters_ may be classed among unskilled\r\nlabourers, they are, perhaps, less miscellaneous, as a body, than\r\nother classes of open-air workers. Before they can obtain work of the\r\nbest description it is necessary that they should have some knowledge\r\nof the management of a horse in the drawing of a loaded carriage, or\r\nof the way in which the animal should be groomed and tended in the\r\nstable. I was told by an experienced carman, that he, or any one with\r\nfar less than his experience, could in a moment detect, merely by the\r\nmode in which a man would put the harness on a horse and yoke him to\r\nthe cart, whether he was likely to prove a master of his craft in that\r\nline or not. My informant had noticed, more especially many years ago,\r\nwhen labour was not so abundantly obtainable as it was last year,\r\nthat men out of work would offer him their services as carmen even if\r\nthey had never handled a whip in their lives, as if little more were\r\nwanted than to walk by the horse’s side. An experienced carter knows\r\nhow to ease and direct the animal when heavily burdened, or when the\r\nroad is rugged; and I am assured by the same informant, that he had\r\nknown one of his horses more fatigued after traversing a dozen miles\r\nwith a “yokel” (as he called him), or an incompetent man, than the\r\nanimal had been after a fifteen miles’ journey with the same load\r\nunder the care of a careful and judicious driver. This knowledge of\r\nthe management of a horse is most essential when men are employed to\r\nwork “single-handed,” or have confided to them singly a horse and cart;\r\nwhen they work in gangs it is not insisted upon, except as regards the\r\n“carman,” or the man having charge of the horse or the team.\r\n\r\nThe master rubbish-carters generally are more particular than they used\r\nto be as to the men to whom they commit the care of their horses. It\r\nmay be easy enough to learn to drive a horse and cart, but a casual\r\nlabourer will now hardly get employment in rubbish-carting of a “good\r\nsort” unless he has attained that preliminary knowledge. The foreman of\r\none of the principal contractors said to me, “It would never do to let\r\na man learn his business by practising on our horses.” I mention this\r\nto show, that although rubbish-carting is to be classed among unskilled\r\nlabours, _some_ training is necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RUBBISH CARTER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nI am informed that one-third of the working rubbish-carters have been\r\nrubbish-carters from their youth, or cart, car, or waggon-drivers, for\r\nthey all seem to have known changes; or they have been used to the care\r\nof horses in the capacity of ostlers, stable-men, helpers, coaching-inn\r\nporters, coachmen, grooms, and horse-breakers. Of the remainder,\r\none-half, I am informed, have “had a turn” at such avocations as\r\nscavagery, bricklayers’ labouring, dock work, railway excavating, night\r\nwork, and the many toils to which such men resort in their struggles\r\nto obtain bread, whatever may have been their original occupation,\r\nwhich is rarely that of an artizan. The other, and what may be called\r\nthe greater half of the remaining number, is composed of agricultural\r\nlabourers who were rubbish-carters in the country, and of the many men\r\nwho have had the care of horses and vehicles in the provinces, and who\r\nhave sought the metropolis, depending upon their thews and sinews for a\r\nlivelihood, as porters, or carmen, or labourers in almost any capacity.\r\nThe most of these men at the plough, the harrow, the manure-cart, the\r\nhay and corn harvests, have been practised carters and horse drivers\r\nbefore they sought the expected gold in the streets of London. Full a\r\nthird of the whole body of rubbish-carters are Irishmen, who in Ireland\r\nwere small farmers, or cottiers, or agricultural labourers, or belonged\r\nto some of the classes I have described.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics among rubbish-carters I heard estimated, by men with\r\nequal means of information, as one in twenty and one in fifteen. Among\r\nthese _quondam_ mechanics were more farriers, cart and wheel wrights,\r\nthan of other classes.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be regarded as an indispensable thing that working\r\nrubbish-carters should have one quality--bodily strength. I am told\r\nthat one employer, who died a few weeks ago, used to say to any\r\napplicant for work, “It’s no use asking for it, if you wish to keep it,\r\nunless you can lift a horse up when he’s down.”\r\n\r\nAs I have shown of the scavagers, &c., the employers in rubbish-carting\r\nmay be classed as “honourable” and “scurfs.” The men do not use the\r\nword “honourable,” nor any equivalent term, but speak of their masters,\r\nthough with no great distinctiveness, as being either “good,” or\r\n“scurfs.” As in other branches of unskilled labour where there are no\r\ntrade societies or general trade regulations among the operatives,\r\nthere are few distinctive appellations.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts I have collected in connection with this trade, it would\r\nappear that there are 180 master rubbish-carters in the metropolis,\r\nabout 140 of whom pay 18_s._ or more per week as wages, while the\r\nremaining 40 pay less than that amount. The latter constitute what the\r\nmen term the scurf portion of the trade; so that the honourable masters\r\namong the rubbish-carters may be said to comprise seven-ninths of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nI will first treat of the circumstances, characteristics, and wages of\r\nthe men employed in the honourable trade.\r\n\r\nAnd first, as regards the _division of labour_ among the operative\r\nrubbish-carters, the work is as simple as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are--\r\n\r\n1. _The Rubbish-Carters_ proper, or “carmen,” who are engaged\r\nprincipally in conveying the refuse brick or earth to the several\r\nshoots.\r\n\r\n2. _The Rubbish-Shovellers_, or “gangers,” who are engaged principally\r\nin filling the cart with the rubbish to be removed. Generally speaking,\r\nthe two offices are performed by the same individual, who is both\r\ncarter and shoveller, and it is only in large works that the gangers\r\nare employed.\r\n\r\nMaster builders and others who require the aid of rubbish-carters for\r\nthe removal of earth or any other kind of rubbish from ground about to\r\nbe built upon, or from old buildings about to be repaired or pulled\r\ndown, either hire horses, carts, and carmen, by the day, of the master\r\nrubbish-carters, or pay a certain price per load for the removal of the\r\nrubbish. If the job be likely to last some length of time, the builders\r\npay the masters so much per load for carting away the rubbish; but\r\nif the job be only for a short period, the horses, carts, and carmen\r\nare hired of the masters for the time. The price paid to the master\r\nrubbish-carter ranges from 2_s._ 6_d._ to 3_s._ 6_d._ per load for the\r\nremoval of rubbish and bringing back such bricks, lime, or sand as may\r\nbe required for the building. The master rubbish-carter, in all cases,\r\npays the men engaged in the removal of the rubbish.\r\n\r\nThe operative rubbish-carters (except in a very few instances) never\r\nwork in gangs, either in the construction of new buildings or in\r\nold buildings about to be pulled down or repaired. In digging the\r\nfoundations of new houses, the master builders, or speculators,\r\nbuilding upon their own ground employ their own excavators, and engage\r\nrubbish-carters to remove the refuse earth, the latter being merely\r\noccupied in carting it away.\r\n\r\nThe principle of simple co-operation or gang-work occasionally\r\nprevails; and, when this is the case, the gang is employed in\r\nshovelling and picking, while the carman, as the shovellers throw out\r\nthe rubbish, fills or shovels the rubbish into the cart.\r\n\r\nEach rubbish-carter will, on an average, convey away from two to five\r\nloads a day, according to the distance he has to take it. Calculating\r\n850 men to remove four loads per diem for five months in a year, the\r\ngross quantity of rubbish annually removed would be very nearly 326,000\r\nloads.\r\n\r\nIn the regular trade _the hours of daily labour_ are twelve, or from\r\nsix to six; but the men are allowed half an hour for breakfast, an\r\nhour for dinner, and half an hour for tea, and almost invariably leave\r\nat half-past five, so postponing the “tea” half-hour until after the\r\ntermination of their work. In winter the hours are generally “between\r\nthe lights,” but on very short, dark, or foggy days, lanterns are used.\r\nThe men employed by one firm “often made up,” I was told by one of\r\nthem, “for lost time, by shovelling by moonlight.” The carman, however,\r\nhas to get to his stable in the summer at four o’clock in the morning,\r\nand to tend his horse after he has done work at night; so that the\r\nusual hours of labour with him are fifteen and sixteen per day, as well\r\nas Sunday-work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF OPERATIVE RUBBISH-CARTERS EMPLOYED\r\nTHROUGHOUT LONDON, THE WAGES RECEIVED BY THEM, THE NUMBER OF WEEKS THEY\r\nARE EMPLOYED, AS WELL AS THE QUANTITY OF RUBBISH REMOVED BY THEM IN THE\r\nCOURSE OF THE YEAR.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------\r\n                                   |No. of Operative\r\n                                   |Rubbish-Carting.\r\n                                   |\r\n                                   |   |No. of Shovellers\r\n                                   |   |working in Gangs.\r\n                                   |   |\r\n                                   |   |  |Quantity of Rubbish\r\n                                   |   |  |carted Daily.\r\n                                   |   |  |\r\n                                   |   |  |    |Quantity of Rubbish\r\n                                   |   |  |    |carted Annually.\r\n                                   |   |  |    |\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |No. of days in the\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |week each Operative\r\n           Master Rubbish          |   |  |    |      |is employed at\r\n              Carters.             |   |  |    |      |Rubbish-Carting.\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |No. of weeks during\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |the year each Operative\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |is engaged in\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |Removing Rubbish.\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |   |Weekly Wages of\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |   |Rubbish-Carters.\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |   |\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |   |    |Weekly Wages of\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |   |    |the Operatives\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |   |    |working in Gangs\r\n                                   |   |  |    |      |  |   |    |at Rubbish-Carting.\r\n  ---------------------------------+---+--+----+------+--+---+----+-------------------\r\n                                   |   |  |lds.|loads.|  |   |_s._|_s._\r\n                  { Mr. J.

The\r\npayment to the operatives by the load varies from 6_d._ to 1_s._\r\n6_d._, for it is necessarily regulated by the distance to be traversed.\r\nIf the rubbish have to be carted a mile to its destination--or, as\r\nthe men call it, to “the shoot”--of course it is to be so conveyed at\r\na proportionally lower rate than if it had to be driven two or three\r\nmiles. The employment of men by the load, however, becomes less every\r\nyear, and the reason, I am assured, is this:--The great stress of the\r\nlabour falls upon the horse. If the animal be strong and manageable,\r\na man, for the sake of conveying an extra load a day, might overtax\r\nits powers, injure it gradually, and deteriorate its strength and its\r\nvalue. The operative carters, on their part, have complained that\r\nsometimes even “good” employers have set them to work by the load with\r\n“hard old horses,” which no management could get out of their slow,\r\nlong-accustomed pace. Thus a man might clear by the piece-work but\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ a day, with a horse not worth 15_l._; while another carter,\r\nwith a superior animal worth twice as much, might clear 3_s._ or 3_s._\r\n6_d._ Some “hard” masters, I was informed, liked these old horses,\r\nbecause they were bought cheap, and though they brought in less than\r\nsuperior animals they were easier kept; while if less were earned by\r\nthe piece-work with such horses, less was paid in wages; and if the\r\nhorse broke its leg, or was killed, or injured, it was more easily\r\nreplaced. This mode of employment is, as I have said, less and less\r\ncarried into effect; but it is still one of the ways in which a working\r\ncarter may be made a sufferer, because a principal accessary of his\r\nwork--the horse--may not be capable of the requisite exertion.\r\n\r\n_The nominal wages_ of the rubbish-carters in the best employ are from\r\n18_s._ to 20_s._ a week; in the worse-paid trade 15_s._ is the more\r\ngeneral price; but even as little as 12_s._ is given by some masters.\r\n\r\n_The actual wages_ are the same as the nominal in the honourable trade,\r\nwith the addition of perquisites in beer to the men of from 1_s._\r\nto 2_s._ weekly, and of “findings,” especially to the carmen, of an\r\namount I could not ascertain, but perhaps realizing 6_d._ a week. One\r\ncarman put all he found on one side to buy new year’s clothes for his\r\nchildren, and on new year’s eve last year he had 48_s._ 0-1/2_d._,\r\n“money, and what brought money;” but this is far from an usual case.\r\n\r\nThe rate of wages paid to the operative rubbish-carters throughout the\r\ndifferent districts of London, I find, by inquiries in each locality,\r\nto be by no means uniform. For instance, at Hampstead the wages are\r\nunexceptionally 20_s._ per week; while at Kensington, Chelsea, and\r\nindeed the whole of the west districts of London, they are 18_s._\r\nweekly; in St. Martin’s parish, however, 19_s._ a week is paid by two\r\nmasters. In the north districts again, 18s. a week is generally paid;\r\nwith the exception of Hampstead, where the weekly wages for the same\r\nlabour are as high as 20_s._, and Islington, where they are as low as\r\n16_s._ In the central districts, too, the wages are generally 18_s._;\r\nthe lower rate of 17_s._ and 16_s._ per week being paid in certain\r\nplaces by “cutting” and “grasping” individuals, who form isolated\r\nexceptions to the rule. In a certain portion of the eastern districts,\r\nsuch as Bethnal Green, St. George’s in the East, and Stepney, 16_s._\r\nand 15_s._ a week appears to be the rule; while in Shoreditch and\r\nPoplar 18_s._ is paid by all the masters. The southern districts of\r\nthe metropolis are equally irregular in their rates of wages. Lewisham\r\npays as low as 15_s._, and Woolwich the same weekly sum, with one\r\nexception. Wandsworth, on the other hand, pays uniformly 17_s._; while\r\nin Southwark, Bermondsey, Newington, and Camberwell, the wages paid by\r\nall are 18_s._ In Lambeth as much as 19_s._ is given by two masters out\r\nof three; whereas, in Greenwich one master pays 14_s._, and the other\r\neven as low as 12_s._ a week. When I come to treat of the lower-paid\r\ntrade, I shall explain the causes of the above difference as regards\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the facts I have collected on this subject is as\r\nfollows:--Out of 180 masters, employing among them 840 men, there are--\r\n\r\n                                           Wages\r\n                                            per\r\n                                           Week.\r\n    5 masters employing 11 men, and paying 20_s._\r\n    5    „        „     30      „      „   19_s._\r\n  127    „        „    605      „      „   18_s._\r\n    6    „        „     20      „      „   17_s._\r\n   16    „        „     70      „      „   16_s._\r\n   19    „        „     97      „      „   15_s._\r\n    1    „        „      5      „      „   14_s._\r\n    1    „        „      2      „      „   12_s._\r\n\r\nHence, three-fourths of the operatives may be said to receive 18_s._\r\nweekly, and about one-sixth 16_s._\r\n\r\n_The perquisites_ in this trade are more in beer than in money, nor are\r\nthey derived from the employers, unless exceptionally. They are given\r\nto the rubbish-carters by the owners of the premises where they work,\r\nand may, in the best trade, amount, in beer or in money to buy beer,\r\nto from 1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ weekly per man. The other perquisites are\r\nwhat is found in the digging of the rubbish for the carts, and in the\r\nshooting of it. As in other trades of a not dissimilar character, there\r\nappears to be no fixed rule as to “treasure trove.” One man told me\r\nthat in digging or shovelling each man kept what he found; another said\r\nthe men drank it. Anything found, however, when the cart is emptied is\r\nthe perquisite of the carman. “It’s luck as is everything;” said one\r\ncarman. “There was a mate of mine as hadn’t not no better work nor me,\r\nonce found an old silver coin, like a bad half-crown, as a gen’lman\r\nhe knowed gave him five good shillings for, and he found a silver\r\nspoon as fetched 1_s._ 9_d._, in one week, and that same week on the\r\nsame ground _I_ got nothing but five bad ha’pennies. I once worked in\r\nthe City where the Sun office now is, just by the Hall of Commerce in\r\nThreadneedle-street, and something was found in the Hall as now is; it\r\nwas a French church once; and an old gent gave us on the sly 1_s._ a\r\nday for beer, to show him or tell him of anything we turned up queer.\r\nWe did show him things as we thought queer, and they looked queer, but\r\nhe all’us said ‘Chi-ish,’ or ‘da-amn.’ From what I’ve heard him say to\r\nanother old cove as sometimes was with him, they looked for something\r\nRoman Catholic.” My informant no doubt meant “Roman,” as in digging the\r\nfoundations of the Hall of Commerce a tesselated Roman pavement was\r\nfound at a great depth.\r\n\r\nAmong these workmen are _no Trade Societies, no Benefit or Sick-Clubs_,\r\nand, indeed, no measures whatever for the upholding of accustomed\r\nwages, or providing “for a rainy day,” unless individually. If a\r\nrubbish-carter be sick, the men in the same employ, whatever their\r\nnumber, 10 or 40, contribute on the Saturday evenings 6_d._ each,\r\ntowards his support, until the patient’s convalescence. There are no\r\nHouses of Call.\r\n\r\nThe _payment is in the master’s yard_ on the Saturday evening, and\r\nalways in money. There are no drawbacks, unless for any period during\r\nthe hours of regular labour, when a man may have been absent from his\r\nwork. Fines there are none, except in large establishments among the\r\ncarmen where many horses are kept, and then, if a man do not keep his\r\nregular stable-hours in the mornings, especially the Sunday mornings,\r\nhe is fined 6_d._ These fines are spent by the carmen generally, and\r\nmost frequently in beer.\r\n\r\nThe _usual way of applying for work_ is to call at the yards or\r\npremises, or, more frequently, to take a round in the districts where\r\nit is known that buildings or excavations are being carried on, to\r\ninquire of the men if a hand be wanted. Sometimes a foreman may be\r\nthere who has authority to “put on” new hands; if not, the applicant,\r\nwith the prospect of an engagement in view, calls upon any party he may\r\nbe directed to. Several men told me that when they were engaged nothing\r\nwas said about character. The employers seem to be much influenced by\r\nthe applicant’s appearance.\r\n\r\nI must now give a brief description of the rubbish-carter, and the\r\nscene of his labours.\r\n\r\nAny one who observes, and does not merely see, the labour of the\r\nrubbish-carter, will have been struck with the stolid indifference with\r\nwhich these men go about their work, however much the scene of their\r\nlabours, from its historical associations, may interest the better\r\ninformed. So it was when the rubbish carters were employed in removing\r\nthe ruins of the old Houses of Parliament, and of that portion of the\r\nTower which suffered from the ravages of the fire; and so it would\r\nbe if they were directed to-morrow to commence the demolition and\r\nrubbish-carting of Westminster Abbey, the Temple Church, or St. Paul’s,\r\neven in their present integrity.\r\n\r\nSometimes the scene of the rubbish-carter’s industry presents what\r\nmay be called a “piteous aspect.” This was not long ago the case in\r\nCannon-street, City, and the adjacent courts and alleys; when the\r\nhouses had been cleared of their furniture, the windows were removed\r\n(giving the house what may be styled a “blind” look); most of the\r\ndoors had been taken away, as well as some of the floors. Large\r\ncyphers, scrawled in whitewash on the walls and woodwork, intimated the\r\ndifferent “lots,” and all spoke of desertion; the only moving thing to\r\nbe seen, perhaps, was some flapping paper, torn from the sides of a\r\nroom and which fluttered in the wind.\r\n\r\nA scene of exceeding bustle follows the apparent desolateness of\r\nthe premises. When the whole has been disposed of to the several\r\npurchasers, the further and final work of demolition begins. Baskets\r\nfilled with the old bricks are rapidly lowered by ropes and pulleys\r\ninto the carts below, it being the carter’s business to empty them,\r\nand then up the empty baskets are drawn, as if by a single jerk. The\r\nsound of the hammer used in removing and separating the old bricks of\r\nthe building, the less frequent sound of the pick-axe, the rumble of\r\nthe stones and bricks into the cart, the noise of the pulleys, the\r\nshouts of the men aloft, crying “be-low there!” the half-articulate\r\nexclamations of the carters choked with dust, form a curious medley\r\nof noises. The atmosphere is usually a cloud of dust, which sticks to\r\nthe men’s hair like powder. The premises are boarded round, and if\r\nadjoining a thoroughfare the boards are closely fitted, to prevent the\r\ncurious and the loiterers obstructing the current of passengers. The\r\nwork within is confined to the labourers; “no persons admitted except\r\non business” seems a rule rigidly enforced. The only men inside who\r\nappear idle are the over-lookers, or surveyors. They stand with their\r\nhands in their breeches’ pockets; and a stranger to the business might\r\naccount them uninterested spectators, but for the directions they\r\noccasionally give, now quietly, and now snappishly; while the Irishmen\r\nshow an excessive degree of activity, the assumption of which never\r\ndeceives an overlooker.\r\n\r\nFrom twelve to one is the customary dinner-hour, and then all is quiet.\r\nOn visiting some new buildings at Maida-hill, I found seven men, out\r\nof about 30, all fast asleep in the nooks and corners of the piles of\r\nbricks and rubbish, the day being fine. The others were eating their\r\ndinners at the public-houses or at their own homes.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of pulling down, the work of removal goes on very\r\nrapidly where a strong force is employed--the number varying from about\r\ntwelve to 30 men. A four-storied house is often pulled down to its\r\nbasement, and the contents of the walls, floors, &c., removed, in ten\r\ndays or a fortnight.\r\n\r\nAs the work of demolition goes on, the rubbish-carter loads the cart\r\nwith the old bricks, mortar, and refuse which the labourers have\r\ndisplaced. In some places, where a number of buildings is being\r\nremoved at the same time, an inclined plane or road is formed by the\r\nrubbish-carters, up and down which the horses and vehicles can proceed.\r\nUntil such means of carriage have been employed, the rubbish from the\r\ninterior foundation is often shot in a mound within the premises, and\r\ncarried off when the way has been formed, excepting such portion as may\r\nbe retained for any purpose.\r\n\r\nIn hot weather, many of the rubbish-carters in the fair trade work in\r\ntheir shirts, a broad woollen belt being strapped round the waist,\r\nwhich, they say, supports “the small of the back” in their frequent\r\nbending and stooping. Some wear woollen night-caps at this work when\r\nthere is much dust; and nearly all the men in the honourable trade\r\nwear the “strong men’s” half-boots, laced up in the front, as the best\r\nprotectors of the feet from the intrusion of rubbish.\r\n\r\nIn the cold weather, the rubbish-carter’s working dress is usually a\r\nsuit of strong drab-white fustian. The suit comprises a jacket with\r\ntwo large pockets. The cost of such a suit, new, at a slop-tailor’s,\r\nis from 28_s._ to 35_s._; from a good shop, and of better materials,\r\n40_s._ to 55_s._ Some prefer stout corduroy to fustian trowsers; and\r\nsome work in short smock-frocks.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown the nature of the work, the class of men\r\nemployed, and the amount of remuneration, I proceed to describe the\r\ncharacteristics of the rubbish-carters employed by the honourable\r\nmasters; I will then describe the state of the labourers who are\r\n_casually_ rather than _constantly_ employed; and finally speak of the\r\ncondition and habits of the lower-paid workers under the cheap masters.\r\n\r\n_The Ability to Read and Write._--I think I heard of fewer instances of\r\ndefective education among the rubbish-carters than among other classes\r\nof unskilled labourers. The number of men who could read and not write,\r\nI found computed at about one-half. It appears that the children of\r\nthese men are very generally sent to school, which is certainly a\r\nhealthful sign as to the desire of the parents to do justice to their\r\noffspring. As among other classes, I met with uneducated men who had\r\nexaggerated notions of the advantages of the capability of reading and\r\nwriting, and men who possessed such capability representing it as a\r\nworthless acquirement.\r\n\r\nThe _majority of the Rubbish-Carters_ in the honourable trade are, I\r\nam informed, _really married men_, and have families “born in lawful\r\nwedlock.” One decent and intelligent man, to whom I was referred,\r\nsaid (his wife being present and confirming his statement): “I don’t\r\nknow how it is, sir, but they say one scabbed sheep will affect a\r\nflock.” “Oh! it’s dreadful,” said the wife; “but some way it seems\r\nto run in places. Now, we’ve lived among people much in our own way\r\nof life in Clerkenwell, and Pentonville, and Paddington. Well, we’ve\r\nreason to believe, that there wasn’t much living together unmarried in\r\nClerkenwell or Pentonville, but a goodish deal in Paddington. I don’t\r\nknow why, for they seemed to live one with another, just as men do\r\nwith their wives. But if there’s daughters, sir, as is growing up and\r\ngets to know it, as they’re like enough to do, ain’t it a bad example?\r\nYes, indeed,” said the wife, “and I’m told they call going together in\r\nthat bad way--they ought all to be punished--without ever entering a\r\nchurch or chapel, getting ‘ready married.’” I inquired if they were not\r\nperhaps married quietly at the Registrar’s office? “O, that,” said Mrs.\r\nB----, “ain’t like being married at all. _I_ would never have consented\r\nto such a way, but I’m pretty certain they don’t as much as do that.\r\nNo, sir,” (in answer to another inquiry), “I hope, and think, it ain’t\r\nso bad among young couples as it was, but its bad enough as it is,\r\nGod he knows.” The proportions of Wedlock and Concubinage I could not\r\nlearn, for the woman, I was assured, always took the man’s name; and\r\nboth man and woman, unless in their cups or their quarrels, declared\r\nthey were man and wife, only there was no good in wasting money to get\r\ntheir “marriage lines” all for no use.\r\n\r\n_The Politics of the rubbish-carters_ are, I am assured by some of the\r\nbest informed among them, of no fixity, or principle, or inclination\r\nwhatever, as regards one-half of the entire body; and that the other\r\nhalf, whether ignorant or not, are Chartists, the Irish generally\r\nexcepted; and they, I understood, as I had learned on previous\r\noccasions, had no political opinions, unless such as were entertained\r\nby their priests. Strong, rude, and ignorant as many of these carters\r\nare, I am told that few of them took part in any public manifestation\r\nof opinion, or in any disturbance, unless they were out of work. “I\r\nthink I know them well,” one of their body said to me, “and as long as\r\nthey have pretty middling of work, it’ll take a very great thing indeed\r\nto move ’em. If they was longish out of work and felt a pinch, very\r\nlikely they’d be found ready for anything.”\r\n\r\n_With respect to Free Trade_, I am told that these men sometimes\r\ndiscuss it, and formerly discussed it far more frequently among\r\nthemselves, but that it was not above one in a dozen, and of the better\r\nsort only, who cared to talk about it either now or then. There seems\r\nno doubt that the majority, whether they understand its principles\r\nand working or not, are favourable to it; I may say, from all I could\r\nlearn, that the _great_ majority are. I heard of one rubbish-carter,\r\nformerly a small farmer, who left London for some other employment, in\r\nthe spring, contending, and taking pains to enforce his conviction,\r\nthat Free Trade would ruin the best interests of rubbish-carters, as\r\nyear by year there would be more agricultural labourers resorting to\r\nthe great towns to look for such work as rubbish-carting, for every\r\nfarmer would employ more Irish labourers at his own terms, and even the\r\n8_s._ a week, the extent of the earnings of the agricultural labourers\r\nin some parishes, would be undersold by the Irish. Last winter, he\r\nsaid, very many countrymen came to London, and would do so the next,\r\nand more and more every year, and so make labour cheaper.\r\n\r\nAs far as I could extend my inquiries and observations, this man’s\r\narguments--although I cannot say I heard any one offer to controvert\r\nthem--were not considered sound, nor his facts fully established. There\r\nwere certainly great numbers of good hands out of employment last\r\nwinter, and many new applicants for work; “but buildings,” I was told\r\nby a carman, “are of course always slacker carried on in the winter.\r\nNow, this year, so far (beginning of October), things seem to promise\r\npretty well in our business, and so if it’s good this winter and was\r\nbad the last, why, as there’s the same Free Trade, it seems as if it\r\nhad nothing to do with it. There’s not so much building going on now\r\nas there was a few years ago, but trade’s steadier, I think.”\r\n\r\nOther rubbish-carters, in the best trade, said that they had found\r\nlittle difference for six or eight years, only as bread was cheaper or\r\ndearer; and, if Free Trade made bread cheap, no man ought to say a word\r\nagainst it, “no matter about anything else.” Of course I give these\r\nopinions as they came to me.\r\n\r\n_As to Food_, these labourers, when in full work, generally live what\r\nthey consider _well_; that is, they eat meat and have beer to their\r\nmeals every day. Three of them told me that they could not say what\r\ntheir living cost separately, as they took all their meals at home\r\nwith their families, their wives laying out the money. One couple had\r\nsix children, and the husband said they cost him about 17_s._ a week\r\nin food, or about 2_s._ 6_d._ per head, reckoning a pint of beer a\r\nday for himself, and not including the youngest, which was an infant\r\nat the breast. The father earned 22_s._ weekly, and the eldest child,\r\na boy, 3_s._ 6_d._ a week for carrying out and collecting the papers\r\nfor a news’-agent. The wife could earn nothing, although an excellent\r\nwasherwoman, the cares of her family occupying her whole time. She\r\nalways had “the cold shivers,” she said, “if ever she thought of\r\nJohn’s being out of work, but he was a steady man, and had been pretty\r\nfortunate.” If these men were engaged on a job at any distance, they\r\nsometimes breakfasted before starting, or carried bread and butter with\r\nthem, and eat it to a pint of coffee if near enough to a coffee-shop,\r\nbut in some places they were not near enough. Their dinners they\r\ncarried with them, generally cold meat and bread, in a basin covered\r\nwith a plate, a handkerchief being tied round it so as to keep the\r\nplate firm and afford a hold to the bearer. “It’s not always, you see,\r\nsir,” said a rubbish-carter, “that there’s a butcher’s shop near enough\r\nto run to and buy a bit of steak and get it dressed at a tap-room\r\nfire, just for buying a pint of beer, and have a knife and fork, and\r\na plate, and salt found you into the bargain, and pepper and mustard\r\ntoo, if you’ll give the girl or the man 1_d._ a week or so. But we’re\r\nglad to get a good cold dinner. O, as to beer, it would be a queer\r\nout-of-the-way place indeed where a landlord didn’t send out a man to\r\na building with beer.” One single man, who told me he was only a small\r\neater, gave me the following as his _daily_ bill of fare, as he rarely\r\ntook any meals at his lodgings:\r\n\r\n                                                 _s._   _d._\r\n  Half-quartern loaf                              0      2-3/4\r\n  Butter                                          0      1\r\n  Coffee (twice a day)                            0      3\r\n  Eleven o’clock beer, sometimes a pint and\r\n    sometimes half-a-pint, but often obtained\r\n    as a perquisite                 (average)     0      1-1/2\r\n  1/2 lb. of beef steak, or a chop, or four or\r\n    five pennyworth of cold meat from a\r\n    cook-shop                       (average)     0      5\r\n  Potatoes                                        0      1\r\n  Dinner beer                                     0      2\r\n  Bread and cheese and beer for supper            0      4\r\n                                                  ------------\r\n                                                  1      8-1/4\r\n\r\nThis was the average cost of his daily food, while on Sundays he\r\ngenerally paid 1_s._ 6_d._ for breakfast and tea, and a good dinner off\r\na hot joint with baked potatoes from the oven, along with the family\r\nand other lodgers. He had a good walk every Sunday morning, he said,\r\nbut liked to sleep away the afternoon. He found his own Sunday beer,\r\ncosting 4_d._ dinner and supper, but he didn’t eat anything at supper,\r\nas he wasn’t inclined after resting all day, and so his weekly expenses\r\nin food were:--\r\n\r\n                                               _s._  _d._\r\n  Six working days, at 1_s._ 8-1/4_d._ a day    10     1-1/2\r\n  Sunday                                         1    10\r\n                                                ------------\r\n  Week’s food                                   11    11-1/2\r\n\r\nTo this, in the way of drink or luxuries, I might add, the carter said,\r\n2_d._ a day for gin (although he wasn’t a drinker and was very seldom\r\ntipsy), “for I treat a friend to a quartern one day and may-be he\r\nstands treat the next.” Also 4_d._ for Sunday gin, as he and the other\r\nmen took a glass just before dinner for an appetite, and he took one\r\nafter dinner to send him asleep. Add, too, 3_d._ a week for tobacco.\r\nIn all 1_s._ 7_d._, which swells the weekly cost of eating, drinking,\r\nand smoking to 13_s._ 6-1/2_d._ His washing was 4_d._ a week (he washed\r\nhis working jacket and trowsers himself), his rent 2_s._ 6_d._ for a\r\nbed to himself; so that, 16_s._ 4-1/2_d._ being spent out of an earning\r\nof 18_s._, he had but 1_s._ 5-1/2_d._ a week left for his clothes,\r\nshoes, &c. If he wanted a shilling or two for anything, he said, he\r\nknocked off his supper, and then nothing was allowed in his reckoning\r\nfor perquisites, so he might be 2_s._ in hand, at least 2_s._, every\r\nweek in a regular way of living. This man expressed his conviction\r\nthat no man, who had to work hard, could live at smaller cost than he\r\ndid. That numbers of men did so, he admitted, but he “couldn’t make it\r\nout.” The two ways of living which I have described may be taken as\r\nthe modes prevalent among this class of labourers, who seek to live\r\n“comfortably.” Others who “rough it” live at less cost, dining, for\r\ninstance, off a pennyworth of pudding and half a pint of beer.\r\n\r\nI ascertained that among the rubbish-carters, _those most frequently\r\nattendant on public worship are the Irish Roman Catholics_, and such\r\nEnglishmen as had been agricultural labourers in rural parishes, and\r\nhad been reared in the habit of church-going; a habit in which, but\r\nnot without many exceptions, they still persevere. Among London-bred\r\nlabourers such habits are rarely formed.\r\n\r\n_The abodes of the better description of rubbish-carters_ are not\r\ngenerally in those localities which are crowded with the poor. They\r\nreside in the streets off the Edgeware and Harrow-roads, as building\r\nhas been carried on to a very great extent in Westbourne, Maida-hill,\r\n&c.; in Portland-town, Camden-town, Somers-town, about King’s-cross;\r\nin Islington, Pentonville, and Clerkenwell; off the Commercial and\r\nMile-end-roads; in Walworth, Camberwell, Kennington, and Newington;\r\nand, indeed, in all the quarters where building has been prosecuted on\r\nan extensive scale. I was in some of their apartments, and found them\r\ntidy and comfortable-looking: one was especially so. Some stone-fruit\r\non the mantel-shelf shone as if newly painted, and the fender and\r\nfire-irons glittered from their brightness to the fire of the small\r\ngrate. The husband, however, was in good earnings, and the wife cleared\r\nabout 5_s._ weekly on superior needlework. There was one thing painful\r\nto observe--the contrast between the robust and sun-burnt look of the\r\nhusband, and the delicate and pallid, not to say sickly, appearance\r\nof the wife. The rents for unfurnished apartments vary from 2_s._ to\r\n5_s._, but rarely the latter, unless the wife take in a little washing.\r\nI heard of some at 2_s._, but very few; 2_s._ 6_d._ to 3_s._ 6_d._ are\r\ncommon prices.\r\n\r\n_I heard of no partiality for amusements among the rubbish-carters_,\r\nbeyond what my informant spoke of--a visit to the play. Some, I was\r\ntold, but principally the younger men, never missed going to a fair,\r\nwhich was not too far off. I think not quite one-half of those I spoke\r\nto, with the best earnings, had been to the Exhibition. Of the worst\r\npaid, I am told, not one in 50 went; one man told me that he had no\r\namusements but his pipe and his beer. Some of them, I was assured,\r\ndrank half a gallon of beer in a day, but at intervals, so as not to\r\nbe intoxicated. “A hand at cribbage” is a favourite public-house game\r\namong a few of these men; but not above one in half-a-dozen, I was\r\nassured, “knew the cards,” and not one in two dozen played them.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the characteristics of the labouring rubbish-carters\r\nemployed in the honourable trade.\r\n\r\nA fine-looking man, upwards of six feet in stature and of proportionate\r\nbulk, with so smart a set to his bushy whiskers, and a look of such\r\ngeneral tidiness (after he had left off work in the evening), that\r\nhe might have been taken for a life-guardsman had it not been for a\r\nslight slouch of the shoulders, and a very unmilitary gait, gave me the\r\nfollowing account:--\r\n\r\n“I’m a London man,” he said, “and though I’m not yet 25, I’ve kept\r\nmyself for the last five years. I’ve worked at rubbish-carting and\r\ngeneral ground-work (digging for pipe-laying, &c.,) as we nearly all\r\ndo, but mainly at rubbish-carting, and I’m at that now. My friends are\r\nin the same line, so I helped them: I was big enough, and was brought\r\nup that way. O, yes, I can read and write, but I haven’t time, or very\r\nseldom, to read anything but a newspaper now and again. I’m a carman\r\nnow, and have a very good master. I’ve served him, more or less, for\r\nthree years. I have had 25_s._ a week, and I have had 29_s._, but\r\nthat included over-work. Two hours extra work a day makes an extra\r\nday in the week, you see, sir. O, yes, I might have saved money, and\r\nI’m trying to save 25_l._ now to see if I can’t raise a horse and\r\ncart, and begin for myself in a small way, general jobbing. I’ve been\r\nused to cart mould, and gravel, and turf for gentlemen’s gardens, or\r\nwhen gardens have been laid out in new buildings, as well as rubbish,\r\nfor the same master. Last year I set to work in hard earnest in the\r\nsame way, and this is where it is that always stops me. Mr. ---- [his\r\nemployer] is very busy now, and things look pretty well about here\r\n[Camden-town], but I don’t know how it is in other parts. It was the\r\nsame last year, but trade fell off in the winter, and I was three\r\nmonths out of work. O, that’s a common case, especial with young men,\r\nfor of course the old hands has the preference. That’s where it is,\r\nyou see, sir; it’s a _uncertain_ trade. It’s always that new shoes is\r\nwanted, but it ain’t always new houses. My money all went, and then all\r\nmy things went to the pawn, and when I got fairly to work again, I had\r\na shirt and a shilling left, and owed some little matters. I’d saved\r\nwell on to 50_s._, and could have gone on saving, but for being thrown\r\nout. Then, when you get into regular wages again, there’s your uncle\r\nto meet, and there’s always something wanted--a pair of half-boots, or\r\na new shirt, or a new tool, or something; so one loses heart about it,\r\nand I can’t abear not to appear respectable.\r\n\r\n“I pay 2_s._ a week for my lodging, but it’s only for half a bed. The\r\nhouse is let out that way to single men like me, so each bed brings\r\nin 4_s._ a week. There’s two beds in the room where I sleep; I don’t\r\nknow how many in all. Why, yes, it’s a respectable sort of a place, but\r\nI don’t much like it. There’s plenty such places; some’s decent and\r\nsome’s not. Oh, certainly, a place of your own’s best, if it’s ever\r\nso humble, but it wouldn’t suit a man like me. I may work one week\r\nat Paddington, and the next at Bow, and if I had a furnished room at\r\nPaddington, what good would it be if I went to work at Bow? Only the\r\nbother and expense of removing my sticks again and again. O, people\r\nthat find lodgings for such as me, know that well enough, and makes a\r\nprey of us, of course.\r\n\r\n“I take my meals at a public-house or a coffee-shop. O yes, I live\r\nwell enough. I have meat every day to dinner; a man like me must keep\r\nup his strength, and you can’t do that without good meat. It’s all\r\nnonsense about vegetables and all that, as if men’s stomachs were like\r\ncows’. I have bread and butter and tea or coffee for breakfast and tea,\r\nsometimes a few cresses with it just to sweeten the blood, which is\r\nthe proper use of vegetables. A pint of beer or so for supper, but I\r\ndon’t care about supper, though now and then I take a bit of bread and\r\ncheese with a nice fresh onion to it. Well, I’m sure I can’t say what\r\nI lay out in my living in a week; sometimes more and sometimes less.\r\nI keep no account; I pay my way as I go on. Some weeks when I get my\r\nSaturday night’s wage, I have from 2_s._ 6_d._ to 6_s._ 6_d._ left from\r\nlast Saturday night’s money, but that’s only when I’ve had nothing to\r\nlay out beyond common. Now, last week I was 4_s._ 9_d._ to the good,\r\nand this week I shall be about the ditto; but then I want a waistcoat\r\nand a silk handkerchief for my neck for Sunday wear; so I must draw on\r\nmy Saturday night. There’s a gentleman takes care of my money for me,\r\nand I carry him what I have over in a week, and he takes care of it\r\nfor me. I did a good deal of work about his houses--he has a block of\r\nthem--and his own place, and I’ve gardened for him; and from what I’ve\r\nheard, my money’s safer with him than with a Savings’ Bank. When I want\r\nto draw he likes to be satisfied what it’s for, and he’s lent me as\r\nmuch as 33_s._ in different sums, when I was hard up. He’s what I call\r\na real gentleman. He says if I ever go to him tipsy to draw, and says\r\nit quite solemn like, he’ll take me by the scruff of the neck and kick\r\nme out; though [laughing] he can’t be much above five foot, and has\r\ngray hairs, and seems a feeble sort of a man, I mean of a gentleman. He\r\nenters all I pay in a book. Here it is, sir, for this year, if you’d\r\nlike to see it. I wasn’t able to put anything by for a goodish bit. I\r\nlost my book once, but I knew how much, and so did Mr. ----, and he put\r\nit down in a lump.\r\n\r\n                           £   _s._ _d._\r\n  July  18   In hand       1    3     0\r\n        25   Received      0    3     6\r\n  Aug.   9      „          0    3     6\r\n        23      „          0    5     0\r\n  Sept. 13      „          0    9     6\r\n        20      „          0    4     0\r\n        27      „          0    4     0\r\n                          -------------\r\n                          £2   12     6\r\n\r\n“If I can’t save a little to start myself on when I’m a single man, I\r\ncan’t ever after, I fancy; so I’m a trying.\r\n\r\n“No, my expenses, over and above my living and lodging and washing, and\r\nall that, ain’t heavy. Yes, I’m very fond of a good play, very. Some\r\ngalleries is 6_d._, and some 3_d._; but then there’s refreshment and\r\nthat, so it costs 1_s._ a time. Perhaps I go once a week, but only in\r\nautumn and winter, when nights get long, and we leave work at half-past\r\nfive. The last time I was at the play was at the Marylebone, but there\r\nwas some opera pieces that don’t suit me; such stuff and nonsense. I\r\nlike something very lively, or else a deep tragedy. Sadler’s Wells is\r\nthe place, sir. I mean to go there to-morrow night. Yes, I’m very fond\r\nof the pantomimes. Concerts I’ve been at, but don’t care for them.\r\nThey’re as dear at 2_d._ as an egg a penny, and an egg’s only a bite.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve gone to church sometimes, but a carman hasn’t time, for he\r\nhas his horses to attend to on Sunday mornings, and that uses up his\r\nmorning. No, I never go now. Work must be done. It ain’t my fault. I’m\r\nsure, if I could have my wish, I’d never do anything on a Sunday.\r\n\r\n“Yes, there’s far too many as undersells us in work. I know that, but\r\nI don’t like to think about them or to talk about them.” [He seemed\r\ndesirous to ignore the very existence of the scurf rubbish-carters.]\r\n“They’re Irish many of them. They’re often quarrelsome and\r\nblood-thirsty, but I know many decent men among the Irishmen in our\r\ngangs. There’s good and bad among them, as there is among the English.\r\nThere’s very few of the Irish that are carmen; they haven’t been much\r\nused to horses.\r\n\r\n“I have done a little as a nightman when I worked for Mr. ----. He was\r\na parish contractor, and undertook such jobs, and liked to put strong\r\nmen on to them. I didn’t like it. I can’t think it’s a healthy trade. I\r\ncan’t say, but I heard it represented, that in this particular calling\r\nthere was a great deal of under-contracting going on when the railway\r\nundertakings generally received a severe check, and when a great\r\nnumber of hands were thrown out of employment, and sought employment\r\nin rubbish-carting generally, and apart from railway-work. These hands\r\nsuffered greatly for a long time. The tommy-shops and the middle-man\r\nsystem were enough to swallow the largest amount of railway wages, so\r\nthat very few had saved money, and they were willing to work for very\r\nlow wages. A good many of these people went to endeavour to find work\r\nat the large new docks being erected at Great Grimsby, near Boston, in\r\nLincolnshire. Some of the more prudent were able to raise the means of\r\nemigrating, and from one cause or other the pressure of this surplus\r\nlabour among rubbish-carters and excavators, as regards the metropolis,\r\nbecame relieved.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF CASUAL LABOUR IN GENERAL, AND THAT OF THE RUBBISH-CARTERS IN\r\nPARTICULAR.\r\n\r\nThe subject of casual labour is one of such vast importance in\r\nconnection with the welfare of a nation and its people, and one of\r\nwhich the causes as well as consequences seem to be so utterly ignored\r\nby economical writers and unheeded by the public, that I purpose\r\nhere saying a few words upon the matter in general, with the view of\r\nenabling the reader the better to understand the difficulties that\r\nalmost all unskilled and many skilled labourers have to contend with in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nBy _casual_ labour I mean such labour as can obtain only _occasional_\r\nas contradistinguished from _constant_ employment. In this definition\r\nI include all classes of workers, literate and illiterate, skilled and\r\nunskilled, whose professions, trades, or callings expose them to be\r\nemployed temporarily rather than continuously, and whose incomes are in\r\na consequent degree fluctuating, casual, and uncertain.\r\n\r\nIn no country in the world is there such an extent, and at the same\r\ntime such a diversity, of casual labour as in Great Britain. This is\r\nattributable to many causes--commercial and agricultural, natural and\r\nartificial, controllable and uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nI will first show what are the causes of casual labour, and then point\r\nout its effects.\r\n\r\nThe causes of casual labour may be grouped under two heads:--\r\n\r\nI. _The Brisk and Slack Seasons, and Fit Times_, or periodical increase\r\nand decrease of work in certain occupations.\r\n\r\nII. _The Surplus Hands_ appertaining to the different trades.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the briskness or slackness of employment in different\r\noccupations. This depends in different trades on different causes,\r\namong which may be enumerated--\r\n\r\nA. The weather.\r\n\r\nB. The seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nC. The fashion of the day.\r\n\r\nD. Commerce and accidents.\r\n\r\nI shall deal with each of these causes _seriatim_.\r\n\r\nA. The labour of thousands is influenced by the _weather_; it is\r\nsuspended or prevented in many instances by stormy or rainy weather;\r\nand in some few instances it is promoted by such a state of things.\r\n\r\nAmong those whose labour cannot be executed on _wet days_, or\r\nexecuted but imperfectly, and who are consequently deprived of their\r\nordinary means of living on such days, are--paviours, pipe-layers,\r\nbricklayers, painters of the exteriors of houses, slaters, fishermen,\r\nwatermen (plying with their boats for hire), the crews of the river\r\nsteamers, a large body of agricultural labourers (such as hedgers,\r\nditchers, mowers, reapers, ploughmen, thatchers, and gardeners),\r\ncostermongers and all classes of street-sellers (to a great degree),\r\nstreet-performers, and showmen.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the degree in which agricultural (or indeed in this\r\ninstance woodland) labour may be influenced by the weather, I may\r\nstate that a few years back there had been a fall of oaks on an estate\r\nbelonging to Col. Cradock, near Greta-bridge, and the poor people,\r\nold men and women, in the neighbourhood, were selected to strip off\r\nthe bark for the tanners, under the direction of a person appointed\r\nby the proprietor: for this work they were paid by the basket-load.\r\nThe trees lay in an open and exposed situation, and the rain was so\r\nincessant that the “barkers” could scarcely do any work for the whole\r\nof the first week, but kept waiting under the nearest shelter in the\r\nhopes that it would “clear up.” In the first week of this employment\r\nnearly one-third of the poor persons, who had commenced their work with\r\neagerness, had to apply for some temporary parochial relief. A rather\r\ncurious instance this, of a parish suffering from the casualty of a\r\nvery humble labour, and actually from the attempt of the poor to earn\r\nmoney, and do work prepared for them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some few classes may be said to be benefited by\r\nthe rain which is impoverishing others: these are cabmen (who are\r\nthe busiest on _showery_ days), scavagers, umbrella-makers, clog and\r\npatten-makers. I was told by the omnibus people that their vehicles\r\nfilled better in hot than in wet weather.\r\n\r\nBut the labour of thousands is influenced also by the _wind_; an\r\neasterly wind prevailing for a few days will throw out of employment\r\n20,000 dock labourers and others who are dependent on the shipping\r\nfor their employment; such as lumpers, corn-porters, timber-porters,\r\nship-builders, sail-makers, lightermen, watermen, and, indeed, almost\r\nall those who are known as ’long-shoremen. The same state of things\r\nprevails at Hull, Bristol, Liverpool, and all our large ports.\r\n\r\n_Frost_, again, is equally inimical to some labourers’ interests;\r\nthe frozen-out market-gardeners are familiar to almost every one,\r\nand indeed all those who are engaged upon the land may be said to be\r\ndeprived of work by severely cold weather.\r\n\r\nIn the weather alone, then, we find a means of starving thousands\r\nof our people. Rain, wind, and frost are many a labourer’s natural\r\nenemies, and to those who are fully aware of the influence of\r\n“the elements” upon the living and comforts of hundreds of their\r\nfellow-creatures, the changes of weather are frequently watched with a\r\nterrible interest. I am convinced that, altogether, a wet day deprives\r\nnot less than 100,000, and probably nearer 200,000 people, including\r\nbuilders, bricklayers, and agricultural labourers, of their ordinary\r\nmeans of subsistence, and drives the same number to the public-houses\r\nand beer-shops (on this part of the subject I have collected some\r\ncurious facts); thus not only decreasing their income, but positively\r\nincreasing their expenditure, and that, perhaps, in the worst of ways.\r\n\r\nNor can there be fewer dependent on the winds for their bread. If we\r\nthink of the vast number employed either directly or indirectly at the\r\nvarious ports of this country, and then remember that at each of these\r\nplaces the prevalence of a particular wind must prevent the ordinary\r\narrival of shipping, and so require the employment of fewer hands; we\r\nshall have some idea of the enormous multitude of men in this country\r\nwho can be starved by “a nipping and an eager air.” If in London\r\nalone there are 20,000 people deprived of food by the prevalence of\r\nan easterly wind (and I had the calculation from one of the principal\r\nofficers of the St. Katherine Dock Company), surely it will not be too\r\nmuch to say that throughout the country there are not less than 50,000\r\npeople whose living is thus precariously dependent.\r\n\r\nAltogether I am inclined to believe, that we shall not be over the\r\ntruth if we assert there are between 100,000 and 200,000 individuals\r\nand their families, or half a million of people, dependent on the\r\nelements for their support in this country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut this calculation refers to those classes only who are deprived of a\r\ncertain number of _days’_ work by an alteration of the weather, a cause\r\nthat is essentially _ephemeral_ in its character. The other series of\r\nnatural events influencing the demand for labour in this country are of\r\na more _continuous_ nature--the stimulus and the depression enduring\r\nfor weeks rather than days. I allude to the _second_ of the four\r\ncircumstances above-mentioned as inducing briskness or slackness of\r\nemployment in different occupations, viz.:--\r\n\r\nB. The seasons.\r\n\r\nThese are the seasons of the year, and not the arbitrary seasons of\r\nfashion, of which I shall speak next.\r\n\r\nThe following classes are among those exposed to the uncertainty of\r\nemployment, and consequently of income, from the above cause, since it\r\nis only in particular seasons that particular works, such as buildings,\r\nwill be undertaken, or that open-air pleasure excursions will be\r\nattempted: carpenters, builders, brickmakers, painters, plasterers,\r\npaper-hangers, rubbish-carters, sweeps, and riggers and lumpers, the\r\nlatter depending mainly on the arrival of the timber ships to the\r\nThames (and this, owing to the ice in the Baltic Sea and in the river\r\nSt. Lawrence, &c., takes place only at certain seasons of the year),\r\ncoal-whippers and coal-porters (the coal trade being much brisker in\r\nwinter), market-porters, and those employed in summer in steam-boat,\r\nrailway, van, and barge excursions.\r\n\r\nThen there are the casualties attending agricultural labour, for,\r\nalthough the operations of nature are regular “even as the seed time\r\nfollows the harvest,” there is, almost invariably, a smaller employment\r\nof labour after the completion of the haymaking, the sheep-shearing,\r\nand the grain-reaping labours.\r\n\r\nFor the hay and corn harvests it is well known that there is a\r\nperiodical immigration of Irishmen and women, who clamour for the\r\n_casual_ employment; others, again, leave the towns for the same\r\npurpose; the same result takes place also in the fruit and pea-picking\r\nseason for the London green-markets; while in the winter such people\r\nreturn some to their own country, and some to form a large proportion\r\nof the casual class in the metropolis. A tall Irishman of about 34\r\nor 35 (whom I had to see when treating of the religion of the street\r\nIrish) leaves his accustomed crossing-sweeping at all or most of the\r\nseasons I have mentioned, and returns to it for the winter at the end\r\nof October; while his wife and children are then so many units to add\r\nto the casualties of the street sale of apples, nuts, and onions, by\r\noverstocking the open-air markets.\r\n\r\nThe autumnal season of hop-picking is the grand rendezvous for the\r\nvagrancy of England and Ireland, the stream of London vagrancy flowing\r\nfreely into Kent at that period, and afterwards flowing back with\r\nincreased volume. Men, women, and children are attracted to the hop\r\nharvest. The season is over in less than a month, and then the casual\r\nlabourers engaged in it (and they are nearly all casual labourers)\r\nmust divert their industry, or their endeavours for a living, into\r\nother channels, swelling the amount of casualty in unskilled work or\r\nstreet-trade.\r\n\r\nNumerically to estimate the influence of the seasons on the\r\nlabour-market of this country is almost an overwhelming task. Let us\r\ntry, however: there are in round numbers one million agricultural\r\nlabourers in this country; saying that in the summer four labourers\r\nare employed for every three in the winter, there would be 250,000\r\npeople and their families, or say 1,000,000 of individuals, deprived\r\nof their ordinary subsistence in the winter time; this, of course,\r\ndoes not include those who come from Ireland to assist at the\r\nharvest-getting--how many these may be I have no means of ascertaining.\r\nAdded to these there are the natural vagabonds, whom I have before\r\nestimated at another hundred thousand (see p. 408, vol. i.), and who\r\ngenerally help at the harvest work or the fruit or hop-picking.\r\n\r\nThen there are the carpenters, who are 163,000 in number; the builders,\r\n9200; the brickmakers, 18,000; the painters, 48,200; the coal-whippers,\r\n9200; the coal-miners, 110,000; making altogether 350,000 people, and\r\nestimating that for every four hands employed in the brisk season,\r\nthere are only three required in the slack, we have 80,000 more\r\nfamilies, or 300,000 people, deprived of their living by the casualty\r\nof labour; so that if we assert that there are, at the least, including\r\nagricultural labourers, 1,250,000 people thus deprived of their usual\r\nmeans of living, we shall not be very wide of the truth.\r\n\r\nThe next cause of the briskness or slackness of different employments\r\nis--\r\n\r\nC. Fashion.\r\n\r\nThe London fashionable season is also the parliamentary season, and is\r\nthe “briskest” from about the end of February to the middle of July.\r\n\r\nThe workmen most affected by the aristocratic, popular, or general\r\nfashions, are--\r\n\r\nTailors, ladies’ habit-makers, boot and shoe-makers, hatters,\r\nglovers, milliners, dress-makers, mantua-makers, drawn and straw\r\nbonnet-makers, artificial flower-makers, plumassiers, stay-makers,\r\nsilk and velvet weavers, saddlers, harness-makers, coach-builders,\r\ncabmen, job-coachmen, farriers, livery stable keepers, poulterers,\r\npastry-cooks, confectioners, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned classes may be taken, according to the Occupation\r\nAbstract of the last Census, at between 500,000 and 600,000; and,\r\nassuming the same ratio as to the difference of employment between the\r\nbrisk and the slack seasons of the trades, or, in other words, that\r\n25 per cent. less hands are required at the slack than at the brisk\r\ntime of these trades, we have another 150,000 people, who, with their\r\nfamilies, may be estimated altogether at say 500,000, who are thrown\r\nout of work at a certain season, and have to starve on as best they can\r\nfor at least three months in the year.\r\n\r\nThe last-mentioned of the causes inducing briskness or slackness of\r\nemployment are--\r\n\r\nD. Commerce and Accidents.\r\n\r\n_Commerce_ has its periodical fits and starts. The publishers, for\r\ninstance, have their season, generally from October to March, as people\r\nread more in winter than in summer; and this arrangement immediately\r\neffects the printers and bookbinders; there is no change, however, as\r\nregards the newspapers and periodicals. Again, the early importation\r\nto this country of the new foreign fruits gives activity to the dock\r\nand wharf labourers and porters and carmen. Thus the arrival here,\r\ngenerally in autumn, of the nut, chestnut, and grape (raisin) produce\r\nof Spain; of the almond crops in Portugal, Spain, and Barbary; the date\r\nharvest in Morocco, and different parts of Africa; the orange gathering\r\nin Madeira, and in St. Michael’s, Terceira, and other islands of the\r\nAzores; the fig harvest from the Levant; the plum harvest of the south\r\nof France; the currant picking of Zante, Ithaca, and other Ionian\r\nIslands;--all these events give an activity, as new fruit is always\r\nmost saleable, to the traders in these southern productions; and more\r\nshopmen, shop-porters, wharf labourers, and assistant lightermen are\r\nrequired--casually required--for the time.\r\n\r\nI was told by a grocer, with a country connection, and in a large\r\nway of business, that for three weeks or a month before Christmas he\r\nrequired the aid of four fresh hands, a shopman, an errand-boy, and two\r\nporters (one skilled in packing), for whom he had nothing to do after\r\nChristmas. If in the wide sweep of London trade there be 1000 persons,\r\nincluding the market salesmen, the retail butchers, the carriers, &c.,\r\nso circumstanced, then 4000 men are _casually_ employed, and for a very\r\nbrief time.\r\n\r\nThe brief increase of the carrying business generally about Christmas,\r\nby road, water, or railway, is sufficiently indicated by the foregoing\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThe employment, again, in the cotton and woollen manufacturing\r\ndistricts may be said to depend for its briskness on commerce rather\r\nthan on the seasons.\r\n\r\n_Accidents_, or extraordinary social events, promote casual labour and\r\nthen depress it. Often they depress without having promoted it.\r\n\r\nDuring the display of the Great Exhibition, there were some thousands\r\nemployed in the different capacities of police, packing, cleaning,\r\nporterage, watching, interpreting, door-keeping and money-taking,\r\ncab-regulating, &c.; and after the close of the Exhibition how\r\nmany were retained? Thus the Great Exhibition fostered casual, or\r\nuncertain labour. Foreign revolutions, moreover, affect the trade of\r\nEngland: speculators become timid and will not embark in trade or in\r\nany proposed undertaking; the foreign import and export trades are\r\nparalysed; and fewer clerks and fewer labourers are employed. Home\r\npolitical agitations, also, have the same effect; as was seen in\r\nLondon during the corn-law riots, about 35 years ago (when only eight\r\nmembers of the House of Commons supported a change in those laws); the\r\nSpafields riots in 1817; the affair in St. Peter’s-field, Manchester,\r\nin 1819; the disturbances and excitement during the trial of Queen\r\nCaroline, in 1820-1, and the loss of life on the occasion of her\r\nfuneral in 1821; the agitation previously to the passing of the Reform\r\nBill had a like effect; the meeting on Kennington Common on the 10th\r\nof April;--in all these periods, indeed, employment decreased. Labour\r\nis affected also by the death of a member of the royal family, and\r\nthe hurried demand for general mourning, but in a very small degree\r\nto what was once the case. A West-End tailor employing a great number\r\nof hands did not receive a single order for mourning on the death of\r\nQueen Adelaide; while on the demise of the Princess Charlotte (in 1817)\r\nthousands of operative tailors, throughout the three kingdoms, worked\r\nday and night, and for double wages, on the general mourning. Gluts\r\nin the markets, an increase of heavy bankruptcies and “panics,” such\r\nas were experienced in the money market in 1825-6, and again in 1846,\r\nwith the failure of banks and merchants, likewise have the effect of\r\naugmenting the mass of casual labour; for capitalists and employers,\r\nunder such circumstances, expend as little as possible in wages or\r\nemployment until the storm blows over. Bad harvests have a similar\r\ndepressing effect.\r\n\r\nThere are also the consequences of changes of taste. The abandonment\r\nof the fashions of gentlemen’s wearing swords, as well as embroidered\r\ngarments, flowing periwigs, large shoe-buckles, all reduced able\r\nartizans to poverty by depriving them of work. So it was, when, to\r\ncarry on the war with France, Mr. Pitt introduced a tax on hair powder.\r\nHundreds of hair-dressers were thrown out of employment, many persons\r\nabandoning the fashion of wearing powder rather than pay the tax. There\r\nare now city gentlemen, who can remember that when clerks, they had\r\nsometimes to wait two or three hours for “their turn” at a barber’s\r\nshop on a Sunday morning; for they could not go abroad until their\r\nhair was dressed and powdered, and their queues trimmed to the due\r\nstandard of fashion. So it has been, moreover, in modern times in the\r\nsubstitution of silk for metal buttons, silk hats for stuff, and in the\r\nsupersedence of one material of dress by another.\r\n\r\nThese several causes, then, which could only exist in a community of\r\ngreat wealth and great poverty have rendered, and are continually\r\nrendering, the labour market uncertain and over-stocked; to what extent\r\nthey do and have done this, it is, of course, almost impossible to\r\nsay _precisely_; but, even with the strongest disposition to avoid\r\nexaggeration, we may assert that there are in this country no less\r\nthan 125,000 families, or 500,000 people, who depend on the weather\r\nfor their food; 300,000 families, or 1,250,000 people, who can\r\nobtain employment only at particular seasons; 150,000 more families,\r\nor 500,000 people, whose trade depends upon the fashionable rather\r\nthan the natural seasons, are thrown out of work at the cessation of\r\nthe brisk time of their business; and, perhaps, another 150,000 of\r\nfamilies, or 500,000 people, dependent on the periodical increase and\r\ndecrease of commerce, and certain social and political accidents which\r\ntend to cause a greater or less demand for labour. Altogether we may\r\nassert, with safety, that there are at the least 725,000 families, or\r\nthree millions of men, women, and children, whose means of living, far\r\nfrom being certain and constant, are of a precarious kind, depending\r\neither upon the rain, the wind, the sunshine, the caprice of fashion,\r\nor the ebbings and flowings of commerce.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut there is a still more potent cause at work to increase the amount\r\nof _casual_ labour in this country. Thus far we have proceeded on\r\nthe assumption that at the brisk season of each trade there is full\r\nemployment for all; but this is far from being the case in the great\r\nmajority, if not the whole, of the instances above cited. In almost all\r\noccupations there is in this country a _superfluity of labourers_, and\r\nthis alone would tend to render the employment of a vast number of the\r\nhands of a casual rather than a regular character. In the generality\r\nof trades the calculation is that one-third of the hands are fully\r\nemployed, one-third partially, and one-third unemployed throughout the\r\nyear. This, of course, would be the case if there were twice too many\r\nwork-people; for suppose the number of work-people in a given trade\r\nto be 6000, and the work sufficient to employ (fully) only half the\r\nquantity, then, of course, 2000 might be occupied their whole time,\r\n2000 more might have work sufficient to occupy them half their time,\r\nand the remaining 2000 have no work at all; or the whole 4000 might,\r\non the average, obtain three months’ employment out of the twelve;\r\nand this is frequently the case. Hence we see that a surplusage of\r\nhands in a trade tends to change the employment of the great majority\r\nfrom a state of constancy and regularity into one of casualty and\r\nprecariousness.\r\n\r\nConsequently it becomes of the highest importance that we should\r\nendeavour to ascertain what are the circumstances inducing a surplusage\r\nof hands in the several trades of the present day. A _surplusage of\r\nhands_ in a trade may proceed from three different causes, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. The alteration of the hours, rate, or mode of working, or else the\r\nterm of hiring.\r\n\r\n2. The increase of the hands themselves.\r\n\r\n3. The decrease of the work.\r\n\r\nEach of these causes is essentially distinct; in the first case there\r\nis neither an increase in the number of hands nor a decrease in the\r\nquantity of work, and yet a surplusage of labourers is the consequence,\r\nfor it is self-evident that if there be work enough in a given trade\r\nto occupy 6000 men all the year round, labouring twelve hours per\r\nday for six days in the week, the same quantity of work will afford\r\noccupation to only 4000 men, or one-third less, labouring between\r\nfifteen and sixteen hours per diem for seven days in the week. The\r\nsame result would, of course, take place, if the workman were made to\r\nlabour one-third more _quickly_, and so to get through one-third more\r\nwork in the same time (either by increasing their interest in their\r\nwork, by the invention of a new tool, by extra supervision, or by the\r\nsubdivision of labour, &c., &c.), the same result would, of course,\r\nensue as if they laboured one-third longer hours, viz., one-third of\r\nthe hands must be thrown out of employment. So, again, by altering the\r\n_mode or form of work_, as by producing on the large scale, instead\r\nof the small, a smaller number of labourers are required to execute\r\nthe same amount of work; and thus (if the market for such work be\r\nnecessarily limited) a surplusage of labourers is the result. Hence we\r\nsee that the alteration of the hours, rate, or mode of working may tend\r\nas positively to overstock a country with labourers as if the labourers\r\nthemselves had unduly increased.\r\n\r\nBut this, of course, is on the assumption that both the quantity of\r\nwork and the number of hands remain the same. The next of the three\r\ncauses, above mentioned as inducing a surplusage of hands, is that\r\nwhich arises from a positive _increase in the number of labourers_,\r\nwhile the quantity of work remains the same or increases at a less rate\r\nthan the labourers; and the third cause is, where the surplusage of\r\nlabourers arises not from any alteration in the number of hands, but\r\nfrom a positive _decrease in the quantity of work_.\r\n\r\nThese are distinctions necessary to be borne clearly in mind for the\r\nproper understanding of this branch of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first case both the number of hands and the quantity of work\r\nremain the same, but the term, rate, or mode of working is changed.\r\n\r\nIn the second, hours, rate, or mode of working remain the same, as well\r\nas the quantity of work, but the number of hands is increased.\r\n\r\nAnd in the third case, neither the number of hands nor the hours, rate,\r\nor mode of working is supposed to have been altered, but the work only\r\nto have decreased.\r\n\r\nThe surplusage of hands will, of course, be the same in each of these\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nI will begin with the first, viz., that which induces a surplusage\r\nof labourers in a trade by enabling fewer hands to get through the\r\nordinary amount of work. This is what is called the “economy of labour.”\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, only three modes of economizing labour, or\r\ncausing the same quantity of work to be done by a smaller number of\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n1st. By causing the men to work _longer_.\r\n\r\n2nd. By causing the men to work _quicker_, and so get through more work\r\nin the same time.\r\n\r\n3rd. By _altering the mode_ of work, or hiring, as in the “large\r\nsystem of production,” where fewer hands are required; or the custom\r\nof temporary hirings, where the men are retained only so long as their\r\nservices are needed, and discharged immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\nFirst, of that mode of economizing labour which depends on an _increase\r\nof either the ordinary hours or days for work_. This is what is usually\r\ntermed over-work and Sunday-work, both of which are largely creative\r\nof surplus hands. The hours of labour in mechanical callings are\r\nusually twelve, two of them devoted to meals, or 72 hours (less by the\r\npermitted intervals) in a week. In the course of my inquiries for the\r\n_Chronicle_, I met with slop cabinet-makers, tailors, and milliners who\r\nworked sixteen hours and more daily, their toil being only interrupted\r\nby the necessity of going out, if small masters, to purchase materials,\r\nand offer the goods for sale; or, if journeymen in the slop trade, to\r\nobtain more work and carry what was completed to the master’s shop.\r\nThey worked on Sundays also; one tailor told me that the coat he worked\r\nat on the previous Sunday was for the Rev. Mr. ----, who “little\r\nthought it,” and these slop-workers rarely give above a few minutes to\r\na meal. Thus they toil 40 hours beyond the hours usual in an honourable\r\ntrade (112 hours instead of 72), in the course of a week, or between\r\nthree and four days of the regular hours of work of the six working\r\ndays. In other words, two such men will in less than a week accomplish\r\nwork which should occupy three men a full week; or 1000 men will\r\nexecute labour fairly calculated to employ 1500 at the least. A paucity\r\nof employment is thus caused among the general body, by this system\r\nof over-labour decreasing the share of work accruing to the several\r\noperatives, and so adding to surplus hands.\r\n\r\nOf over-work, as regards excessive labour, both in the general and\r\nfancy cabinet trade, I heard the following accounts, which different\r\noperatives concurred in giving; while some represented the labour as of\r\nlonger duration by at least an hour, and some by two hours, a day, than\r\nI have stated.\r\n\r\nThe labour of the men who depend entirely on “the slaughter-houses”\r\nfor the purchase of their articles is usually seven days a week\r\nthe year through. That is, seven days--for Sunday work is all but\r\nuniversal--each of 13 hours, or 91 hours in all; while the established\r\nhours of labour in the “honourable trade” are six days of the week,\r\neach of 10 hours, or 60 hours in all. Thus 50 per cent. is added to\r\nthe extent of the production of low-priced cabinet-work, merely from\r\n“over-hours;” but in some cases I heard of 15 hours for seven days in\r\nthe week, or 105 hours in all.\r\n\r\nConcerning the hours of labour in this trade, I had the following\r\nminute particulars from a garret-master who was a chair-maker:--\r\n\r\n“I work from six every morning to nine at night; some work till ten.\r\nMy breakfast at eight stops me for ten minutes. I can breakfast in\r\nless time, but it’s a rest; my dinner takes me say twenty minutes at\r\nthe outside; and my tea, eight minutes. All the rest of the time I’m\r\nslaving at my bench. How many minutes’ rest is that, sir? Thirty-eight;\r\nwell, say three-quarters of an hour, and that allows a few sucks at a\r\npipe when I rest; but I can smoke and work too. I have only one room\r\nto work and eat in, or I should lose more time. Altogether I labour\r\n14-1/4 hours every day, and I must work on Sundays--at least 40 Sundays\r\nin the year. One may as well work as sit fretting. But on Sundays I\r\nonly work till it’s dusk, or till five or six in summer. When it’s\r\ndusk I take a walk. I’m not well-dressed enough for a Sunday walk when\r\nit’s light, and I can’t wear my apron on that day very well to hide\r\npatches. But there’s eight hours that I reckon I take up every week one\r\nwith another, in dancing about to the slaughterers. I’m satisfied that\r\nI work very nearly 100 hours a week the year through; deducting the\r\ntime taken up by the slaughterers, and buying stuff--say eight hours\r\na week--it gives more than 90 hours a week for my work, and there’s\r\nhundreds labour as hard as I do, just for a crust.”\r\n\r\nThe East-end turners generally, I was informed, when inquiring into\r\nthe state of that trade, labour at the lathe from six o’clock in the\r\nmorning till eleven and twelve at night, being 18 hours’ work per day,\r\nor 108 hours per week. They allow themselves two hours for their meals.\r\nIt takes them, upon an average, two hours more every day fetching and\r\ncarrying their work home. Some of the East-end men work on Sundays, and\r\nnot a few either, said my informant. “Sometimes I have worked hard,”\r\nsaid one man, “from six one morning till four the next, and scarcely\r\nhad any time to take my meals in the bargain. I have been almost\r\nsuffocated with the dust flying down my throat after working so many\r\nhours upon such heavy work too, and sweating so much. It makes a man\r\ndrink where he would not.”\r\n\r\nThis system of over-work exists in the “slop” part of almost every\r\nbusiness--indeed, it is the principal means by which the cheap trade is\r\nmaintained. Let me cite from my letters in the _Chronicle_ some more of\r\nmy experience on this subject. As regards the London mantua-makers, I\r\nsaid:--“The workwomen for good shops that give fair, or tolerably fair\r\nwages, and expect good work, can make six average-sized mantles in a\r\nweek, _working from ten to twelve hours a day_; but the slop-workers,\r\nby toiling from thirteen to sixteen hours a day, will make _nine_ such\r\nsized mantles in a week. In a season of twelve weeks 1000 workers\r\nfor the slop-houses and warehouses would at this rate make 108,000\r\nmantles, or 36,000 more than workers for the fair trade. Or, to put it\r\nin another light, these slop-women, by being compelled, in order to\r\nlive, to work such over-hours as inflict lasting injury on the health,\r\nsupplant, by their over-work and over-hours, the labour of 500 hands,\r\nworking the regular hours.”\r\n\r\nThe following are the words of a chamber-master, working for the cheap\r\nshoe trade:--\r\n\r\n“From people being obliged to work twice the hours they once _did_\r\nwork, or that in reason they _ought_ to work, a glut of hands is the\r\nconsequence, and the masters are led to make reductions in the wages.\r\nThey take advantage of our poverty and lower the wages, so as to\r\nundersell each other, and command business. My daughters have to work\r\nfifteen hours a day that we may make a bare living. They seem to have\r\nno spirit and no animation in them; in fact, such very hard work takes\r\nthe youth out of them. They have no time to enjoy their youth, and,\r\nwith all their work, they can’t present the respectable appearance they\r\nought.” “I” (interposed my informant’s wife) “often feel a faintness\r\nand oppression from my hard work, as if my blood did not circulate.”\r\n\r\nThe better class of artizans denounce the system of Sunday working as\r\nthe most iniquitous of all the impositions. They object to it, not\r\nonly on moral and religious grounds, but economically also. “Every\r\n600 men employed on the Sabbath,” say they, “deprive 100 individuals\r\nof a week’s work. Every six men who labour seven days in the week\r\nmust necessarily throw one other man out of employ for a whole week.\r\nThe seventh man is thus deprived of his fair share of work by the\r\novertoiling of the other six.” This Sunday working is a necessary\r\nconsequence of the cheap slop-trade. The workmen cannot keep their\r\nfamilies by their six days’ labour, and therefore they not only, under\r\nthat system, get less wages and do more work, but by their extra labour\r\nthrow so many more hands out of employment.\r\n\r\nHere then, in the over-work of many of the trade, we find a vast cause\r\nof surplus hands, and, consequently, of casual labour; and that the\r\nwork in these trades has not proportionately increased is proven by the\r\nfact of the existence of a superfluity of workmen.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our attention to the second of the causes above cited,\r\nviz., _the causing of men to work quicker_, and so to accomplish\r\nmore in the same time. There are several means of attaining this end;\r\nit may be brought about either (_a_) by making the workman’s gains\r\ndepend directly on the quantity of work executed by him, as by the\r\nsubstitution of piece-work for day-work; (_b_) by the omission of\r\ncertain details or parts necessary for the perfection of the work;\r\n(_c_) by decreasing the workman’s pay, and so increasing the necessity\r\nfor him to execute a greater quantity of work in order to obtain the\r\nsame income; (_d_) increasing the supervision, and encouraging a spirit\r\nof emulation among the workpeople; (_e_) by dividing the labour into a\r\nnumber of simple and minute processes, and so increasing the expertness\r\nof the labourers; (_f_) by the invention of some new tool or machine\r\nfor expediting the operations of the workman.\r\n\r\nI shall give a brief illustration of each of these causes _seriatim_,\r\nshowing how they tend to produce a surplusage of hands in the trades\r\nto which they are severally applied. And first, as to _making the\r\nworkman’s gains depend directly on the quantity of work executed by\r\nhim_.\r\n\r\nOf course there are but two direct modes of paying for labour--either\r\nby the day or by the piece. Over-work by day-work is effected by means\r\nof what is called the “strapping system” (as described in the _Morning\r\nChronicle_ in my letter upon the carpenters and joiners), where a whole\r\nshop are set to race over their work in silence one with another, each\r\nstriving to outdo the rest, from the knowledge that anything short of\r\nextraordinary exertion will be sure to be punished with dismissal.\r\nOver-work by piece-work, on the other hand, is almost a necessary\r\nconsequence of that mode of payment--for where men are paid by the\r\nquantity they do, of course it becomes the interest of a workman to do\r\nmore than he otherwise would.\r\n\r\n“Almost all who work by the day, or for a fixed salary, that is to\r\nsay, those who labour for the gain of others, not for their own,\r\nhave,” it has been well remarked, “no interest in doing more than the\r\nsmallest quantity of work that will pass as a fulfilment of the mere\r\nterms of their engagement. Owing to the insufficient interest which\r\nday labourers have in the result of their labour, there is a natural\r\ntendency in such labour to be extremely inefficient--a tendency\r\nonly to be overcome by vigilant superintendence on the part of the\r\npersons who _are_ interested in the result. The ‘master’s eye’ is\r\nnotoriously the only security to be relied on. But superintend them\r\nas you will, day labourers are so much inferior to those who work by\r\nthe piece, that, as was before said, the latter system is practised in\r\nall industrial occupations where the work admits of being put out in\r\ndefinite portions, without involving the necessity of too troublesome\r\na surveillance to guard against inferiority (or scamping) in the\r\nexecution.” But if the labourer at piece-work is made to produce a\r\ngreater quantity than at day-work, and this solely by connecting his\r\nown interest with that of his employer, how much more largely must the\r\nproductiveness of workmen be increased when labouring wholly on their\r\nown account! Accordingly it has been invariably found that whenever\r\nthe operative unites in himself the double function of capitalist\r\nand labourer, as the “garret-master” in the cabinet trade, and the\r\n“chamber-master” in the shoe trade, making up his own materials or\r\nworking on his own property, his productiveness, single-handed, is\r\nconsiderably greater than can be attained even under the large system\r\nof production, where all the arts and appliances of which extensive\r\ncapital can avail itself are brought into operation.\r\n\r\nAs regards the increased production by _omitting certain details\r\nnecessary for the due perfection of the work_, it may be said that\r\n“scamping” adds at least 200 per cent. to the productions of the\r\ncabinet-maker’s trade. I ascertained, in the course of my previous\r\ninquiries, several cases of this over-work from scamping, and adduce\r\ntwo. A very quick hand, a little master, working, as he called it, “at\r\na slaughtering pace,” for a warehouse, made 60 plain writing-desks in a\r\nweek of 90 hours; while a first-rate workman, also a quick hand, made\r\n18 in a week of 70 hours. The scamping hand said he must work at the\r\nrate he did to make 14_s._ a week from a slaughter-house; and so used\r\nto such style of work had he become, that, though a few years back he\r\ndid West-end work in the best style, he could not now make eighteen\r\ndesks in a week, if compelled to finish them in the style of excellence\r\ndisplayed in the work of the journeyman employed for the honourable\r\ntrade. Perhaps, he added, he couldn’t make them in that style at all.\r\nThe frequent use of rosewood veneers in the fancy cabinet, and their\r\noccasional use in the general cabinet trade gives, I was told, great\r\nfacilities for scamping. If in his haste the scamping hand injure the\r\nveneer, or if it have been originally faulty, he takes a mixture of\r\ngum shellac and “colour” (colour being a composition of Venetian red\r\nand lamp black), which he has ready by him, rubs it over the damaged\r\npart, smooths it with a slightly-heated iron, and so blends it with\r\nthe colour of the rosewood that the warehouseman does not detect the\r\nflaw. In the general, as contradistinguished from the fancy, cabinet\r\ntrade I found the same ratio of “scamping.” A good workman in the\r\nbetter-paid trade made a four-foot mahogany chest of drawers in five\r\ndays, working the regular hours, and receiving, at piece-work price,\r\n35_s._ A scamping hand made five of the same size in a week, and had\r\ntime to carry them for sale to the warehouses, wait for their purchase\r\nor refusal, and buy material. But for the necessity of doing this the\r\nscamping hand could have made seven in the 91 hours of his week, though\r\nof course in a very inferior manner. “They would hold together for a\r\ntime,” I was assured, “and that was all; but the slaughterer cared only\r\nto have them viewly and cheap.” These two cases exceed the average, and\r\nI have cited them to show what _can_ be done under the scamping system.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the _increased rate of working induced by a reduction of\r\nthe ordinary rate of remuneration of the workman_. Not only is it true\r\nthat over-work makes under-pay, but the converse of the proposition\r\nis equally true, that under-pay makes over-work--that is to say,\r\nit is true of those trades where the system of piece-work or small\r\nmastership admits of the operative doing the utmost amount of work\r\nthat he is able to accomplish; for the workman in such cases seldom\r\nor never thinks of reducing his expenditure to his income, but rather\r\nof increasing his labour, so as still to bring his income, by extra\r\nproduction, up to his expenditure. Hence we find that, as the wages\r\nof a trade descend, so do the labourers extend their hours of work\r\nto the utmost possible limits--they not only toil earlier and later\r\nthan before, but the Sunday becomes a work-day like the rest (amongst\r\nthe “sweaters” of the tailoring trade Sunday labour, as I have shown,\r\nis almost universal); and when the hours of work are carried to the\r\nextreme of human industry, then more is sought to be done in a given\r\nspace of time, either by the employment of the members of their own\r\nfamily, or apprentices, upon the inferior portion of the work, or else\r\nby “scamping it.” “My employer,” I was told by a journeyman tailor\r\nworking for the Messrs. Nicoll, “reduces my wages one-third, and the\r\nconsequence is, I put in two stitches where I used to give three.” “I\r\nmust work from six to eight, and later,” said a pembroke-table-maker\r\nto me, “to get 18_s._ now for my labour, where I used to get 54_s._ a\r\nweek--that’s just a third. I could in the old times give my children\r\ngood schooling and good meals. Now children have to be put to work\r\nvery young. I have four sons working for me at present.” Not only,\r\ntherefore, does any stimulus to extra production make over-work, and\r\nover-work make under-pay; but under-pay, by becoming an additional\r\nprovocative to increased industry, again gives rise in its turn to\r\nover-work. Hence we arrive at a plain unerring law--_over-work makes\r\nunder-pay and under-pay makes over-work_.\r\n\r\nBut the above means of increasing the rate of working refer solely\r\nto those cases where the extra labour is induced by making it the\r\n_interest_ of the workman so to do. The other means of extra production\r\nis _by stricter supervision of journeymen, or those paid by the day_.\r\nThe shops where this system is enforced are termed “strapping-shops,”\r\nas indicative of establishments where an undue quantity of work is\r\nexpected from a journeyman in the course of the day. Such shops, though\r\nnot directly making use of cheap labour (for the wages paid in them\r\nare generally of the higher rate), still, by exacting more work, may\r\nof course be said, in strictness, to encourage the system now becoming\r\ngeneral, of less pay and inferior skill. These strapping establishments\r\nsometimes go by the name of “scamping shops,” on account of the time\r\nallowed for the manufacture of the different articles not being\r\nsufficient to admit of good workmanship.\r\n\r\nConcerning this “_strapping_” system I received the following\r\nextraordinary account from a man after his heavy day’s labour. Never in\r\nall my experience had I seen so sad an instance of overwork. The poor\r\nfellow was so fatigued that he could hardly rest in his seat. As he\r\nspoke he sighed deeply and heavily, and appeared almost spirit-broken\r\nwith excessive labour:--\r\n\r\n“I work at what is called a strapping shop,” he said, “and have worked\r\nat nothing else for these many years past in London. I call ‘strapping’\r\ndoing as much work as a human being or a horse possibly can in a day,\r\nand that without any hanging upon the collar, but with the foreman’s\r\neyes constantly fixed upon you, from six o’clock in the morning to six\r\no’clock at night. The shop in which I work is for all the world like\r\na prison; the silent system is as strictly carried out there as in a\r\nmodel gaol. If a man was to ask any common question of his neighbour,\r\nexcept it was connected with his trade, he would be discharged there\r\nand then. If a journeyman makes the least mistake, he is packed off\r\njust the same. A man working at such places is almost always in fear;\r\nfor the most trifling things he’s thrown out of work in an instant.\r\nAnd then the quantity of work that one is forced to get through is\r\npositively awful; if he can’t do a plenty of it, he don’t stop long\r\nwhere I am. No one would think it was possible to get so much out of\r\nblood and bones. No slaves work like we do. At some of the strapping\r\nshops the foreman keeps continually walking about with his eyes on all\r\nthe men at once. At others the foreman is perched high up, so that he\r\ncan have the whole of the men under his eye together. I suppose since\r\nI knew the trade that a _man does four times the work that he did\r\nformerly_. I know a man that’s done four pairs of sashes in a day, and\r\none is considered to be a good day’s labour. What’s worse than all, the\r\nmen are every one striving one against the other. Each is trying to\r\nget through the work quicker than his neighbours. Four or five men are\r\nset the same job, so that they may be all pitted against one another,\r\nand then away they go every one striving his hardest for fear that the\r\nothers should get finished first. They are all bearing along from the\r\nfirst thing in the morning to the last at night, as hard as they can\r\ngo, and when the time comes to knock off they are ready to drop. I was\r\nhours after I got home last night before I could get a wink of sleep;\r\nthe soles of my feet were on fire, and my arms ached to that degree\r\nthat I could hardly lift my hand to my head. Often, too, when we get\r\nup of a morning, we are more tired than when we went to bed, for we\r\ncan’t sleep many a night; but we mustn’t let our employers know it, or\r\nelse they’d be certain we couldn’t do enough for them, and we’d get the\r\nsack. So, tired as we may be, we are obliged to look lively, somehow\r\nor other, at the shop of a morning. If we’re not beside our bench the\r\nvery moment the bell’s done ringing, our time’s docked--they wont\r\ngive us a single minute out of the hour. If I was working for a fair\r\nmaster, I should do nearly one-third, and sometimes a half, less work\r\nthan I am now forced to get through, and, even to manage that much, I\r\nshouldn’t be idle a second of my time. It’s quite a mystery to me how\r\nthey _do_ contrive to get so much work out of the men. But they are\r\nvery clever people. They know how to have the most out of a man, better\r\nthan any one in the world. They are all picked men in the shop--regular\r\n‘strappers,’ and no mistake. The most of them are five foot ten, and\r\nfine broad-shouldered, strong-backed fellows too--if they weren’t they\r\nwouldn’t have them. Bless you, they make no words with the men, they\r\nsack them if they’re not strong enough to do all they want; and they\r\ncan pretty soon tell, the very first shaving a man strikes in the shop,\r\nwhat a chap is made of. Some men are done up at such work--quite old\r\nmen and gray with spectacles on, by the time they are forty. I have\r\nseen fine strong men, of 36, come in there and be bent double in two or\r\nthree years. They are most all countrymen at the strapping shops. If\r\nthey see a great strapping fellow, who they think has got some stuff\r\nabout him that will come out, they will give him a job directly. We are\r\nused for all the world like cab or omnibus horses. Directly they’ve\r\nhad all the work out of us, we are turned off, and I am sure, after my\r\nday’s work is over, my feelings must be very much the same as one of\r\nthe London cab horses. As for Sunday, it is _literally_ a day of rest\r\nwith us, for the greater part of us lay a-bed all day, and even that\r\nwill hardly take the aches and pains out of our bones and muscles. When\r\nI’m done and flung by, of course I must starve.”\r\n\r\nThe next means of inducing a quicker rate of working, and so\r\neconomizing the number of labourers, is by the _division_ and\r\n_subdivision of labour_. In perhaps all the skilled work of London, of\r\nthe better sort, this is more or less the case; it is the case in a\r\nmuch smaller degree in the country.\r\n\r\nThe nice subdivision makes the operatives perfect adepts in their\r\nrespective branches, working at them with a greater and a more assured\r\nfacility than if their care had to be given to the whole work, and in\r\nthis manner the work is completed in less time, and consequently by\r\nfewer hands.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the extraordinary increased productiveness induced\r\nby the division of labour, I need only cite the well-known cases:--\r\n\r\n“It is found,” says Mr. Mill, “that the productive power of labour is\r\nincreased by carrying the separation further and further; by breaking\r\ndown more and more every process of industry into parts, so that each\r\nlabourer shall confine himself to an even smaller number of simple\r\noperations. And thus, in time, arise those remarkable cases of what is\r\ncalled the division of labour, with which all readers on subjects of\r\nthis nature are familiar. Adam Smith’s illustration from pin-making,\r\nthough so well-known, is so much to the point, that I will venture\r\nonce more to transcribe it. ‘The business of making a pin is divided\r\ninto eighteen distinct operations. One man draws out the wire, another\r\nstraightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, and a fifth grinds\r\nit at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two\r\nor three distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business;\r\nto whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put\r\nthem into the paper. I have seen a small manufactory where ten men\r\nonly were employed, and where some of them, consequently, performed\r\ntwo or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and\r\ntherefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery,\r\nthey could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve\r\npounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of 4000 pins of a\r\nmiddling size.\r\n\r\n“‘Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of 48,000\r\npins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of 48,000\r\npins, might be considered as making 4800 pins in a day. But if they\r\nhad all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them\r\nhaving been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could\r\nnot each of them have made 20, perhaps not one pin in a day.’”\r\n\r\nM. Say furnishes a still stronger example of the effects of division\r\nof labour, from a not very important branch of industry certainly,\r\nthe manufacture of playing cards. “It is said by those engaged in the\r\nbusiness, that each card, that is, a piece of pasteboard of the size of\r\nthe hand, before being ready for sale, does not undergo fewer than 70\r\noperations, every one of which might be the occupation of a distinct\r\nclass of workmen. And if there are not 70 classes of work-people in\r\neach card manufactory, it is because the division of labour is not\r\ncarried so far as it might be; because the same workman is charged\r\nwith two, three, or four distinct operations. The influence of this\r\ndistribution of employment is immense. I have seen a card manufactory\r\nwhere thirty workmen produced daily 15,500 cards, being above 500 cards\r\nfor each labourer; and it may be presumed that if each of these workmen\r\nwere obliged to perform all the operations himself, even supposing him\r\na practised hand, he would not, perhaps, complete two cards in a day;\r\nand the 30 workmen, instead of 15,500 cards, would make only 60.”\r\n\r\nOne great promoter of the decrease of manual labour is to be found in\r\nthe economy of labour from a very different cause to any I have pointed\r\nout as tending to the increase of surplus hands and casual labour,\r\nviz., to _the use of machinery_.\r\n\r\nIn this country the use of machinery has economised the labour both\r\nof man and horse to a greater extent than is known in any other land,\r\nand that in nearly all departments of commerce or traffic. The total\r\nestimated machine power in the kingdom is 600,000,000 of human beings,\r\nand this has been all produced within the last century. In agriculture,\r\nfor example, the threshing of the corn was the peasant’s work of the\r\nlater autumn and of a great part of the winter, until towards the\r\nlatter part of the last century. The harvest was hardly considered\r\ncomplete until the corn was threshed by the peasants. On the first\r\nintroduction of the threshing machines, they were demolished in many\r\nplaces by the country labourers, whose rage was excited to find that\r\ntheir winter’s work, instead of being regular, had become _casual_.\r\n\r\nBut the use of these machines is now almost universal. It would, of\r\ncourse, be the height of absurdity to say that threshing machines\r\ncould possibly increase the number of threshers, even as the reaping\r\nmachines cannot possibly increase the number of reapers; their effect\r\nis rather to displace the greater number of labourers so engaged, and\r\nhence indeed the “economy” of them. It is not known what number of\r\nmen were, at any time, employed in threshing corn. Their displacement\r\nwas gradual, and in some of the more remote parts of the provinces,\r\nthe flails of the threshers may be heard still, but if a threshing\r\nmachine--for they are of different power--do the work, as has been\r\nstated, of six labourers, the economization or displacement of manual\r\nlabour is at once shown to be the economization and displacement of the\r\nwhole labour (for a season) of a country side; thus increasing surplus\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIn other matters--in the unloading vessels by cranes, in _all_ branches\r\nof manufactures, and even in such minor matters as the grinding of\r\ncoffee berries, and the cutting and splitting of wood for lucifer\r\nmatches, an immense amount of manual labour has been minimized,\r\neconomized, or displaced by steam machinery. On my inquiry into the\r\ncondition of the London sawyers, I found that the labour of 2000 men\r\nhad been displaced by the steam saw-mills of the metropolis alone.\r\nAt one of the largest builder’s I saw machines for making mortises\r\nand tenons, for sticking mouldings, and, indeed, performing all\r\nthe operations of the carpenter--one such machine doing the work,\r\nperhaps, of a hundred men. I asked the probable influence that such\r\nan instrument was likely to have on the men? “Ruin them all,” was\r\nthe laconic reply of the superintendent of the business! Within the\r\nlast year casks have been made by machinery--a feat that the coopers\r\ndeclared impossible. Wheels, also, have been lately produced by steam.\r\nI need, however, as I have so recently touched upon the subject, do\r\nno more than call attention to the information I have given (p. 240,\r\nvol. ii.) concerning the use of machinery in lieu of human labour.\r\nIt is there shown that if the public street-sweeping were effected,\r\nthroughout the metropolis, by the machines, nearly 196 of the 275\r\nmanual labourers, now scavaging for the parish contractors, would\r\nbe thrown out of work, and deprived of 7438_l._, out of their joint\r\nearnings, in the year.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion of political economists to insist on the general\r\nproposition that machinery increases the demand for labour, rather than\r\ndecreases it; when they write unguardedly, however, they invariably\r\nbetray a consciousness that the benefits of machinery to manual\r\nlabourers are not quite so invariable as they would otherwise make out.\r\nHere, for instance, is a confession from the pamphlet on “the Employer\r\nand Employed,” published by the Messrs. Chambers, gentlemen who surely\r\ncannot be accused of being averse to economical doctrines. It is true\r\nthe pamphlet is intended to show the evils of strikes to working men,\r\nbut it likewise points out the evils of mechanical power to the same\r\nclass when applied to certain operations.\r\n\r\n“Strikes also lead to _the superseding of hand labour by machines_,”\r\nsays this little work. “In 1831, on the occasion of a strike at\r\nManchester, several of the capitalists, afraid of their business being\r\ndriven to other countries, had recourse to the celebrated machinists,\r\nMessrs. Sharp and Co. of Manchester, requesting them to direct the\r\ninventive talents of their partner, Mr. Roberts, to the construction\r\nof a self-acting mule, in order to emancipate the trade from galling\r\nslavery and impending ruin. Under assurances of the most liberal\r\nencouragement in the adoption of his invention, Mr. Roberts suspended\r\nhis professional pursuits as an engineer, and set his fertile genius\r\nto construct a spinning automaton. In the course of a few months he\r\nproduced a machine, called the ‘Self-acting Mule,’ which, in 1834, was\r\nin operation in upwards of 60 factories; _doing the work of the head\r\nspinners so much better than they could do it themselves, as to leave\r\nthem no chance against it_.\r\n\r\n“In his work on the ‘Philosophy of Manufactures,’ Dr. Ure observes on\r\nthe same subject--‘The elegant art of calico-printing, which embodies\r\nin its operations the most elegant problems of chemistry, as well as\r\nmechanics, had been for a long period the sport of foolish journeymen,\r\nwho turned the liberal means of comfort it furnished them into weapons\r\nof warfare against their employers and the trade itself. They were,\r\nin fact, by their delirious combinations, plotting to kill the goose\r\nwhich laid the golden eggs of their industry, or to force it to fly\r\noff to a foreign land, where it might live without molestation. In\r\nthe spirit of Egyptian task-masters, the operative printers dictated\r\nto the manufacturers the number and quality of the apprentices to be\r\nadmitted into the trade, the hours of their own labour, and the wages\r\nto be paid them. At length capitalists sought deliverance from this\r\nintolerable bondage in the resources of science, and were speedily\r\nreinstated in their legitimate dominion of the head over the inferior\r\nmembers. The four-colour and five-colour machines, which now render\r\ncalico-printing an unerring and expeditious process, are mounted in\r\nall great establishments. It was under the high-pressure of the same\r\ndespotic confederacies, that self-acting apparatus for executing the\r\ndyeing and rinsing operations has been devised.’\r\n\r\n“The croppers of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and the hecklers or\r\nflax-dressers, can unfold ‘a tale of wo’ on this subject. Their\r\nearnings exceeded those of most mechanics; but the frequency of\r\nstrikes among them, and the irregularities in their hours and times of\r\nworking, compelled masters to substitute machinery for their manual\r\nlabour. _Their trades, in consequence, have been in a great measure\r\nsuperseded._”\r\n\r\nIt must, then, be admitted that machinery, _in some cases at least_,\r\ndoes displace manual labour, and so tend to produce a surplusage\r\nof labourers, even as over-work, Sunday-work, scamping-work,\r\nstrapping-work, piece-work, minutely-divided work, &c., have the same\r\neffect so long as the quantity of work to be done remains unaltered.\r\n_The extensibility of the market_ is the one circumstance which\r\ndetermines whether the economy of labour produced by these means is\r\na blessing or a curse to the nation. To apply mechanical power, the\r\ndivision of labour, the large system of production, or indeed any\r\nother means of enabling a less number of labourers to do the same\r\namount of work _when the quantity of work to be done is limited in\r\nits nature_, as, for instance, the threshing of corn, the sawing of\r\nwood, &c., is necessarily to make either paupers or criminals of those\r\nwho were previously honest independent men, living by the exercise of\r\ntheir industry in that particular direction. Economize your labour\r\none-half, in connection with a particular article, and you must sell\r\ntwice the quantity of that article or displace a certain number of\r\nthe labourers; that is to say, suppose it requires 400 men to produce\r\n4000 commodities in a given time, then, if you enable 200 men to\r\nproduce the same quantity in the same time, you must get rid of 8000\r\ncommodities, or deprive a certain number of labourers of their ordinary\r\nmeans of living. Indeed, the proposition is almost self-evident, though\r\ngenerally ignored by social philosophers: economize your labour at a\r\ngreater rate than you expand your markets, and you must necessarily\r\nincrease your paupers and criminals in precisely the same ratio. “The\r\ndivision of labour,” says Mr. Mill, following Adam Smith, “is limited\r\nby the extent of the market. If by the separation of pin-making into\r\nten distinct employments 48,000 pins can be made in a day, this\r\nseparation will only be advisable if the number of accessible consumers\r\nis such as to require every day something like 48,000 pins. If there is\r\na demand for only 25,000, the division of labour can be advantageously\r\ncarried but to the extent which will every day produce that smaller\r\nnumber.” Again, as regards the large system of production, the same\r\nauthority says, “the possibility of substituting the large system of\r\nproduction for the small depends, of course, on the extent of the\r\nmarket. The large system can only be advantageous when a large amount\r\nof business is to be done; it implies, therefore, either a populous and\r\nflourishing community, or a great opening for exportation.” But these\r\nare mere glimmerings of the broad incontrovertible principle, that _the\r\neconomization of labour at a greater rate than the expansion of the\r\nmarkets, is necessarily the cause of surplus labour in a community_.\r\n\r\nThe effect of machinery in depriving the families of agricultural\r\nlabourers of their ordinary sources of income is well established.\r\n“Those countries,” writes Mr. Thornton, “in which the class of\r\nagricultural labourers is most depressed, have all one thing in common.\r\nEach of them was formerly the seat of a flourishing manufacture\r\ncarried on by the cottagers at their own homes, which has now decayed\r\nor been withdrawn to other situations. Thus, in Buckinghamshire and\r\nBedfordshire, the wives and children of labouring men had formerly very\r\nprofitable occupation in making lace; during the last war a tolerable\r\nlacemaker, working eight hours a day, could easily earn 10_s._ or\r\n12_s._ a week; the profits of this employment have been since so much\r\nreduced by the use of machinery, that a pillow lacemaker must now work\r\ntwelve hours daily to earn 2_s._ 6_d._ a week.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last of the conditions above cited, as causing the same or a\r\ngreater amount of work to be executed with a less quantity of labour,\r\nis _the large system of production_. Mr. Babbage and Mr. Mill have\r\nso well and fully pointed out “the economy of labour” effected in\r\nthis manner, that I cannot do better than quote from them upon this\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n“Even when no additional subdivision of the work,” says Mr. Mill,\r\n“would follow an enlargement of the operations, there will be good\r\neconomy in enlarging them to the point at which every person to\r\nwhom it is convenient to assign a special occupation will have full\r\nemployment in that occupation.” This point is well illustrated by Mr.\r\nBabbage:--“If machines be kept working through the 24 hours” [which is\r\nevidently the only economical mode of employing them], “it is necessary\r\nthat some person shall attend to admit the workmen at the time they\r\nrelieve each other; and whether the porter or other servant so employed\r\nadmit one person or twenty, his rest will be equally disturbed. It will\r\nalso be necessary occasionally to adjust or repair the machine; and\r\nthis can be done much better by a workman accustomed to machine-making\r\nthan by the person who uses it. Now, since the good performance and the\r\nduration of machines depend, to a very great extent, upon correcting\r\nevery shake or imperfection in their parts as soon as they appear, the\r\nprompt attention of a workman resident on the spot will considerably\r\nreduce the expenditure arising from the wear and tear of the machinery.\r\nBut in the case of a single lace-frame, or a single loom, this would\r\nbe too expensive a plan. Here, then, arises another circumstance,\r\nwhich tends to enlarge the extent of the factory. It ought to consist\r\nof such a number of machines as shall occupy the whole time of one\r\nworkman in keeping them in order. If extended beyond that number the\r\nsame principle of economy would point out the necessity of doubling or\r\ntripling the number of machines, in order to employ the whole time of\r\ntwo or three skilful workmen. Where one portion of the workman’s labour\r\nconsists in the exertion of mere physical force, as in weaving, and in\r\nmany similar arts, it will soon occur to the manufacturer that, if that\r\npart were executed by a steam-engine, the same man might, in the case\r\nof weaving, attend to two or more looms at once; and, since we already\r\nsuppose that one or more operative engineers have been employed, the\r\nnumber of looms may be so arranged that their time shall be fully\r\noccupied in keeping the steam-engine and the looms in order.\r\n\r\n“Pursuing the same principles, the manufactory becomes gradually\r\nso enlarged that the expense of lighting during the night amounts\r\nto a considerable sum; and as there are already attached to the\r\nestablishment persons who are up all night, and can therefore\r\nconstantly attend to it, and also engineers to make and keep in\r\nrepair any machinery, the addition of an apparatus for making gas to\r\nlight the factory leads to a new extension, at the same time that it\r\ncontributes, by diminishing the expense of lighting and the risk of\r\naccidents from fire, to reduce the cost of manufacturing.\r\n\r\n“Long before a factory has reached this extent it will have been found\r\nnecessary to establish an accountant’s department, with clerks to pay\r\nthe workmen, and to see that they arrive at their stated times; and\r\nthis department must be in communication with the agents who purchase\r\nthe raw produce, and with those who sell the manufactured article. It\r\nwill cost these clerks and accountants little more time and trouble\r\nto pay a large number of workmen than a small number, to check the\r\naccounts of large transactions than of small. If the business doubled\r\nitself it would probably be necessary to increase, but certainly not\r\nto double, the number either of accountants or of buying and selling\r\nagents. _Every increase of business would enable the whole to be\r\ncarried on with a proportionally smaller amount of labour._ As a\r\ngeneral rule, the expenses of a business do not increase by any means\r\nproportionally to the quantity of business. Let us take as an example\r\na set of operations which we are accustomed to see carried on by one\r\ngreat establishment--that of the Post Office.\r\n\r\n“Suppose that the business, let us say only of the London letter-post,\r\ninstead of being centralised in a single concern, were divided among\r\nfive or six competing companies. Each of these would be obliged to\r\nmaintain almost as large an establishment as is now sufficient for the\r\nwhole. Since each must arrange for receiving and delivering letters\r\nin all parts of the town, each must send letter-carriers into every\r\nstreet, and almost every alley, and this, too, as many times in the\r\nday as is now done by the Post Office, if the service is to be as\r\nwell performed. Each must have an office for receiving letters in\r\nevery neighbourhood, with all subsidiary arrangements for collecting\r\nthe letters from the different offices and re-distributing them. I\r\nsay nothing of the much greater number of superior officers who would\r\nbe required to check and control the subordinates, implying not only\r\na greater cost in salaries for such responsible officers, but the\r\nnecessity, perhaps, of being satisfied in many instances with an\r\ninferior standard of qualification, and so failing in the object.”\r\n\r\nBut this refers solely to the “large system of business” as applied\r\nto purposes of manufacture and distribution. In connection with\r\nagriculture there is the same saving of labour effected. “The large\r\nfarmer,” says Mr. Mill, “has some advantage in the article of\r\nbuildings. It does not cost so much to house a great number of cattle\r\nin one building, as to lodge them equally well in several buildings.\r\nThere is also some advantage in implements. A small farmer is not so\r\nlikely to possess expensive instruments. But the principal agricultural\r\nimplements, even when of the best construction, are not expensive. It\r\nmay not answer to a small farmer to own a threshing machine for the\r\nsmall quantity of corn he has to thresh; but there is no reason why\r\nsuch a machine should not in every neighbourhood be owned in common, or\r\nprovided by some person to whom the others pay a consideration for its\r\nuse. The large farmer can make some saving in cost of carriage. There\r\nis nearly as much trouble in carrying a small portion of produce to\r\nmarket, as a much greater produce; in bringing home a small, as a much\r\nlarger quantity of manure, and articles of daily consumption. There is\r\nalso the greater cheapness of buying things in large quantities.”\r\n\r\nA short time ago I went into Buckinghamshire to look into the allotment\r\nsystem. And, in one parish of 1800 acres, I found that some years ago\r\nthere were seventeen farmers who occupied, upon the average, 100 acres\r\neach, and who, previous to the immigration of the Irish harvest-men,\r\n_constantly_ employed six men a-piece, or, in the aggregate, upwards\r\nof 100 hands. Now, however, the farmers in the same parish occupy to\r\nthe extent of 300 acres each, and respectively employ only six men _and\r\na few extra hands at harvest time_. Thus the number of hands employed\r\nby this system has been decreased one-half. I learned, moreover, from\r\na clergyman there, who had resided in Wiltshire, that the same thing\r\nwas going on in that county also; that small farms were giving way to\r\nlarge farms, and that at least half the labourers had been displaced.\r\nThe agricultural labourers, at the time of taking the last census,\r\nwere 1,500,000 in number; so that, if this system be generally carried\r\nout, there must be 750,000 labourers and their families, or 3,000,000\r\npeople, deprived of their living by it.\r\n\r\nSir James Graham, in his evidence before the Committee on Criminal\r\nCommitments, has given us some curious particulars as to the decrease\r\nof the number of hands required for agricultural purposes, where the\r\nlarge system of production is pursued in place of the small: he has\r\ntold us how many hands he was enabled to get rid of by these means, the\r\nproportion of labour displaced, it will be seen, amounted to about 10\r\nper cent. of the labouring population. In answer to a question relative\r\nto the increase of population in his district, he replied:--\r\n\r\n“I have myself taken _very strong means to prevent it_, for it so\r\nhappens that my whole estate came out of lease in the year 1822, after\r\nthe currency of a lease of fourteen years; and by _consolidation of\r\nfarms, and the destruction of cottages, I have diminished, upon my own\r\nproperty, the population to the extent of from 300 to 400 souls_.”\r\n\r\n“On how many acres?--On about 30,000 acres.” [This is at the rate of\r\none in every 100 acres].\r\n\r\n“What was the whole extent of population?--It was under 4000 before I\r\nreduced it.\r\n\r\n“What became of those 300 or 400?--The greater part of them, being\r\nsmall tenants, were enabled to find farms on the estates of other\r\nproprietors, who pursued the opposite course of subdividing their\r\nestates for the purpose of obtaining higher nominal rents; _others\r\nhave become day labourers_, and as day labourers, I have reason to\r\nknow, they are more thriving than they were on my estate as small\r\nfarmers, subject to a high rent, which their want of capital seldom\r\nenabled them to pay; two or three of these families went to America.\r\n\r\n“Have you any out of work?--None entirely out of work, some only\r\npartially employed; but since the _dispersion of this large mass of\r\npopulation_, the supply of labour has not much exceeded the demand,\r\nfor _whenever I removed a family, I pulled down the house_, and the\r\nparochial jealousy respecting settlements is an ample check on the\r\ninflux of strangers.”\r\n\r\nSimilar to the influence of the large system of production in its\r\ndisplacement of labourers, as enabling a larger quantity of work to be\r\nexecuted by one establishment with a smaller number of hands than would\r\nbe required were the amount of work to be divided into a number of\r\nsmaller establishments,--similar to this mode of economizing labour, is\r\nthat mode of work which, by altering the produce rather than the mode\r\nof production, and by substituting an article that requires less labour\r\nfor one that required more, gets rid of a large quantity of labour,\r\nand, consequently, adds to the surplusage of labourers. An instance of\r\nthis is in the substitution of pasturage for tillage. “_Plough less and\r\ngraze more_,” says Sir J. Graham, the great economist of labour, simply\r\nbecause fewer people will be required to attend to the land. But this\r\nplan of grazing instead of ploughing was adopted in this country some\r\ncenturies back, and with what effect to the labourers and the people\r\nat large, the following extract from the work of Mr. Thornton, on\r\nover-population, will show:--\r\n\r\n“The extension of the woollen manufacture was raising the price of\r\nwool; and the little attendance which sheep require was an additional\r\nmotive for causing sheep farming to be preferred to tillage. Arable\r\nland, therefore, began to be converted into pasture; and the\r\nseemingly-interminable corn fields, which, like those of Germany at\r\nthis day, probably extended for miles without having their even surface\r\nbroken by fences or any other visible boundaries, disappeared. After\r\nbeing sown with grass they were surrounded and divided by inclosures,\r\nto prevent the sheep from straying, and to do away with the necessity\r\nof having shepherds always on the watch. By these changes the quantity\r\nof work to be done upon a farm was exceedingly diminished, and most\r\nof the servants, whom it had been usual to board and lodge in the\r\nmanor and farm-houses, were dismissed. This was not all. The married\r\nfarm-servants were ousted from their cottages, which were pulled down,\r\nand their gardens and fields were annexed to the adjoining meadows. The\r\nsmall farmers were treated in the same way, as their leases fell in,\r\n_and were sent to join the daily increasing crowd of competitors for\r\nwork that was daily increasing in quantity_.\r\n\r\n“Even freeholders were in some instances ejected from their lands. This\r\nsocial revolution had probably commenced even before the prosperity\r\nof the peasantry had reached its climax; but in 1487 it attracted the\r\nnotice of Parliament, and an Act was passed to restrain its progress;\r\nfor already it was observed that inclosures were becoming ‘more\r\nfrequent, whereby arable land, _which could not be manured without\r\npeople and families, was turned into pasture, which was easily rid by\r\na few herdsmen_;’ and that ‘tenancies for years, lives, and at will,\r\nwhereupon most of the yeomanry lived, were turned into demesnes’[35].\r\nIn 1533[36], an Act was passed strongly condemning the practice of\r\n‘accumulating’ farms, which it was declared had reduced ‘a marvellous\r\nmultitude’ of the people to poverty and misery, and left them no\r\nalternative but to steal, or to die ‘pitifully’ of cold and hunger. In\r\nthis Act it was stated that single farms might be found with flocks of\r\nfrom 10,000 to 20,000 sheep upon them; and it was ordained that no man\r\nshould keep more than 2000 sheep, except upon his own land, or rent\r\nmore than two farms.\r\n\r\n“Two years later it was enacted that the king should have a moiety of\r\nthe profits of land converted (subsequently to a date specified) from\r\ntillage to pastures, until a suitable house was erected, and the land\r\nwas restored to tillage. In 1552, a law[37] was made which required\r\nthat on all estates as large a quantity of land as had been kept in\r\ntillage for four years together at any time since the accession of\r\nHenry VIII., should be so continued in tillage. But these, and many\r\nsubsequent enactments of the same kind, had not the smallest effect in\r\nchecking the consolidation of farms. We find Roger Ascham, in Queen\r\nElizabeth’s reign, lamenting the dispersion of families, the ruin of\r\nhouses, the breaking up and destruction of ‘the noble yeomanry, the\r\nhonour and strength of England.’ Harrison also speaks of towns pulled\r\ndown for sheep-walks; ‘and of the tenements that had fallen either down\r\nor into the lord’s hands;’ or had been ‘brought and united together by\r\nother men, so that in some one manor, seventeen, eighteen, or twenty\r\nhouses were shrunk.’[38]\r\n\r\n“‘Where have been a great many householders and inhabitants,’ says\r\nBishop Latimer, ‘there is now but a shepherd and his dog.’[39] And in a\r\ncurious tract, published in 1581, by one William Stafford, a husbandman\r\nis made to exclaim, ‘Marry, these inclosures do and undo us all, for\r\nthey make us pay dearer for our land that we occupy, and causeth that\r\nwe can have no land to put to tillage; all is taken up for pasture,\r\neither for sheep or for grazing of cattle, insomuch that I have known\r\nof late a dozen ploughs, within less compass than six miles about me,\r\nlaid down within this seven years; and where threescore persons or\r\nupwards had their livings, now one man, with his cattle, hath all.\r\nThose sheep is the cause of all our mischief, for they have driven\r\nhusbandry out of the country, by which was increased before all kinds\r\nof victuals, and now altogether sheep, sheep, sheep.’[40] While numbers\r\nof persons were thus continually driven from their homes, and deprived\r\nof their means of livelihood, we need not be at a loss to account for\r\nthe increase of vagrancy, without ascribing it to the increase of\r\npopulation.”\r\n\r\nAs an instance, within our time, of the same mode of causing a\r\nsurplusage of labourers, and so adding to the quantity of casual labour\r\nin the kingdom, viz., by the extension of pasturage and consequent\r\ndiminution of tillage, we may cite the “clearances,” as they were\r\ncalled, which took place, some few years back, in the Highlands of\r\nScotland. “It is only within the last few years,” says the author\r\nabove quoted, “that the strathes and glens of Sutherland have been\r\n_cleared of their inhabitants, and that the whole country has been\r\nconverted into one immense sheepwalk_, over which the traveller may\r\nproceed for 40 miles together without seeing a tree or a stone wall, or\r\nanything, but a heath dotted with sheep and lambs[41].... The example\r\nof Sutherland is imitated in the neighbouring counties. During the\r\nlast four years _some hundreds of families_ have been ‘weeded’ out of\r\nRoss-shire, and nearly 400 more have received notice to quit next year.\r\nSimilar notice has been given to 34 families in Cromarty, and only the\r\nother day eighteen families, who were living in peace and comfort, in\r\nGlencalvie, in Ross-shire, were expelled from the farms occupied for\r\nages by themselves and their forefathers, to make room for sheep.” And\r\nstill we are told to “_plough less and graze more!_”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to the last-mentioned of the circumstances inducing a\r\nsurplusage of labourers, and, consequently, augmenting the amount of\r\ncasual labour throughout the kingdom, viz., by _altering the mode of\r\nhiring the labourers_. At page 236 of the present volume, I have said,\r\nin connection with this part of the subject,--\r\n\r\n“Formerly the mode of hiring farm-labourers was by the year, so that\r\nthe employer was bound to maintain the men when unemployed. But now\r\nweekly hirelings and even journey-work, or hiring by the day, prevail,\r\nand the labourers being paid mere subsistence-money only when wanted\r\nare necessitated to become either paupers or thieves when their\r\nservices are no longer required. It is, moreover, this change from\r\nyearly to weekly and daily hirings, and the consequent discarding of\r\nmen when no longer wanted, that has partly caused the immense mass\r\nof surplus labourers, who are continually vagabondizing through the\r\ncountry, begging or stealing as they go--men for whom there is but\r\nsome two or three weeks’ work (harvesting, hop-picking, and the like)\r\nthroughout the year.”\r\n\r\nBlackstone, in treating of the laws relating to master and servant (the\r\ngreater part of the farm labourers or farm servants, as they were then\r\ncalled, being included under the latter head), tells us at page 425 of\r\nhis first volume--\r\n\r\n“The first sort of servants, acknowledged by the laws of England, are\r\nMENIAL SERVANTS; so called from being _inter mœnia_ or domestic. The\r\ncontract between them and their masters arises upon the hiring. If\r\nthe hiring be generally, without any particular _time limited_, the\r\nlaw construes it to be a _hiring for a year_ (Co. Lit. 42); upon a\r\nprinciple of natural equity, that the servant shall serve, and the\r\nmaster maintain him, throughout all the revolutions of the respective\r\nseasons, as well when _there is work to be_ done, as _when there is\r\nnot_.”\r\n\r\nMr. Thornton says, “until recently it had been common for farm\r\nservants, even when married and living in their own cottages, to take\r\ntheir meals with their master; and, what was of more consequence, in\r\nevery farm-house, many unmarried servants, of both sexes, were lodged,\r\nas well as boarded. The latter, therefore, even if ill paid, might\r\nbe tolerably housed and fed, and many of them fared, no doubt, much\r\nbetter than they could have done if they had been left to provide for\r\nthemselves, with treble their actual wages.”\r\n\r\nFormerly throughout the kingdom--and it is a custom _still_ prevalent\r\nin some parts, more especially in the north--single men and women\r\nseeking engagements as farm-servants, congregated at what were called\r\nthe “Hirings,” held usually on the three successive market days,\r\nwhich were nearest to May-day and Martinmas-day. The hiring was\r\nthus at two periods of the year, but the engagement was usually for\r\nthe twelvemonth. By the concurrent consent, however, of master and\r\nservant, when the hiring took place, either side might terminate it at\r\nthe expiration of the six months, by giving due notice; or a further\r\nhiring for a second twelvemonth could be legally effected without the\r\nnecessity of again going to the hirings. The servants, even before\r\ntheir term of service had expired, could attend a hiring (generally\r\nheld under the authority of the town’s charter) as a matter of right;\r\nthe master and mistress having no authority to prevent them. The Market\r\nCross was the central point for the holding of the hirings, and the\r\nmen and women, the latter usually the most numerous, stood in rows\r\naround the cross. The terms being settled, the master or mistress gave\r\nthe servant “a piece of money,” known as a “god’s penny” (the “handsel\r\npenny”), the offer and acceptance of this god’s penny being a legal\r\nratification of the agreement, without any other step. In the old times\r\nsuch engagements had almost always (as shown in the term “God’s penny”)\r\na character of religious obligation. At the earliest period, the\r\nhirings were held in the church-yards; afterwards by the Market Cross.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of this matter more in the past than the present tense,\r\nfor the system is greatly changed as regards the male farm-servant,\r\nthough little as regards the female. Now the male farm-labourers,\r\ninstead of being hired for a specific term, are more generally hired\r\nby week, by job, or by day; indeed, even “half-a-day’s” work is known.\r\nAt one period it was merely the married country labourers, residing\r\nin their own cottages, who were temporarily engaged, but it is now\r\nthe general body, married and unmarried, old and young, with a few\r\nexceptions. Formerly the farmer was bound to find work for six or\r\ntwelve months (for both terms existed) for his hired labourers. If\r\nthe land did not supply it, still the man must be maintained, and be\r\npaid his full wages when due. By such a provision, the labour and wage\r\nof the hired husbandman were regular and rarely _casual_; but this\r\narrangement is now seldom entered into, and the hired husbandman’s\r\nlabour is consequently generally casual and rarely regular. This\r\nprinciple of hiring labourers only for so long as they are wanted, as\r\ncontradistinguished from the “_principle of natural equity_,” spoken\r\nof by Blackstone, which requires that “the servant shall serve and the\r\nmaster maintain him _throughout all the revolutions of the respective\r\nseasons, as well when there is work to be done as when there is not_,”\r\nhas been the cause, perhaps, of more casual labour and more pauperism\r\nand crime, in this country, than, perhaps, any other of the antecedents\r\nbefore mentioned. The harvest is now collected solely by casual\r\nlabourers, by a horde of squalid immigrants, or the tribe of natural\r\nand forced vagabonds who are continually begging or stealing their way\r\nthroughout the country; our hops are picked, our fruit and vegetables\r\ngathered by the same precarious bands--wretches who, perhaps, obtain\r\nsome three months’ harvest labour in the course of the year. The ships\r\nat our several ports are discharged by the same “_casual hands_,” who\r\nmay be seen at our docks scrambling like hounds for the occasional bit\r\nof bread that is vouchsafed to them; there numbers loiter throughout\r\nthe day, even on the chance of _an hour’s employment_; for the term of\r\nhiring has been cut down to the finest possible limits, so that the\r\nlabourer may not be paid for even a second longer than he is wanted.\r\nAnd since he gets only bare subsistence money when employed, “What,” we\r\nshould ask ourselves, “_must_ be his lot when unemployed?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI now come to consider the circumstances causing an undue increase\r\nof the labourers in a country. Thus far we have proceeded on the\r\nassumption that both the quantity of work to be done and the number\r\nof hands to do it remained stationary, and we have seen that by the\r\nmere alteration of the time, rate, and mode of working, a vast amount\r\nof surplus, and, consequently, casual labour may be induced in a\r\ncommunity. We have now to ascertain how, still assuming the quantity of\r\nwork to remain unaltered, the same effect may be brought about by an\r\nundue _increase of the number of labourers_.\r\n\r\nThere are many means by which the number of labourers may be increased\r\nbesides that of a positive increase of the people. These are--\r\n\r\n1. By the undue increase of apprentices.\r\n\r\n2. By drafting into the ranks of labour those who should be otherwise\r\nengaged, as women and children.\r\n\r\n3. By the importation of labourers from abroad.\r\n\r\n4. By the migration of country labourers to towns, and so overcrowding\r\nthe market in the cities.\r\n\r\n5. By the depression of other trades.\r\n\r\n6. By the undue increase of the people themselves.\r\n\r\nEach and every of the first-mentioned causes are as effective a\r\ncircumstance for the promotion of surplus labour, as even the positive\r\nextension of the population of the country.\r\n\r\nLet me begin with the undue increase of a trade by means of\r\n_apprentices_.\r\n\r\nThis is, perhaps, one of the chief aids to the cheap system. For it\r\nis principally by apprentice labour that the better masters, as well\r\nas workmen, are undersold, and the skilled labourer consequently\r\ndepressed to the level of the unskilled. But the great evil is, that\r\nthe cheapening of goods by this means causes an undue increase in the\r\ntrade. The apprentices grow up and become labourers, and so the trade\r\nis glutted with workmen, and casual labour is the consequence.\r\n\r\nThis apprentice system is the great bane of the printer’s trade.\r\nCountry printers take an undue number of boys to help them cheap;\r\nthese lads grow up, and then, finding wages in the provinces depressed\r\nthrough this system of apprentice labour, they flock to the towns, and\r\nso tend to glut the labour market, and consequently to increase the\r\nnumber of casual hands.\r\n\r\nOne cause of the increased surplus and casual labour in such trades\r\nas dressing-case, work-box, writing-desk-making and other things in\r\nthe fancy cabinet trade (among the worst trades even in Spitalfields\r\nand Bethnal Green), shoemaking, and especially of women and children’s\r\nshoes, is the taking of many apprentices by small masters (supplying\r\nthe great warehouses). As journey-work is all but unknown in the slop\r\nfancy cabinet trade, an apprentice, when he has “served his time,”\r\nmust start on his own account in the same wretched way of business, or\r\nbecome a casual labourer in some unskilled avocation, and this is one\r\nway in which the hands surely, although gradually, increase beyond the\r\ndemand. It is the same with the general slop cabinet-maker’s trade in\r\nthe same parts. The small masters supply the “slaughterhouses,” the\r\nlinen-drapers, &c., who sell cheap furniture; they work in the quickest\r\nand most scamping manner, and do more work (which is nearly all done\r\non the chance of sale), as they must confine themselves to one branch.\r\nThe slop chair-makers cannot make tables, nor the slop table-makers,\r\nchairs; nor the cheffonier and drawer-makers, bedsteads; for they have\r\nnot been taught. Even if they knew the method, and _could_ accomplish\r\nother work, the want of practice would compel them to do it slowly,\r\nand the slop mechanic can never afford to work slowly. Such classes\r\nof little masters, then, to meet the demand for low-priced furniture,\r\nrear their sons to the business, and frequently take apprentices, to\r\nwhom they pay small amounts. The hands so trained (as in the former\r\ninstances) are not skilled enough to work for the honourable trade,\r\nso that they can only adopt the course pursued by their parents, or\r\nmasters, before them. Hence a rapid, although again gradual, increase\r\nof surplus hands; or hence a resort to some unskilled labour, to be\r\nwrought casually. This happens too, but in a smaller degree, in trades\r\nwhich are not slop, from the same cause. Concerning the _apprentice\r\nsystem_ in the boot and shoe trade, when making my inquiries into the\r\ncondition of the London workmen, I received the following statements:--\r\n\r\n“My employer had seven apprentices when I was with him; of these, two\r\nwere parish apprentices (I was one), and the other five from the Refuge\r\nfor the Destitute, at Hoxton. With each Refuge boy he got 5_l._ and\r\nthree suits of clothes, and a kit (tools). With the parish boys of\r\nCovent-garden and St. Andrew’s, Holborn, he got 5_l._ and two suits\r\nof clothes, reckoning what the boy wore as one. My employer was a\r\njourneyman, and by having all us boys he was able to get up work very\r\ncheap, though he received good wages for it. We boys had no allowance\r\nin money, only board, lodging, and clothing. The board was middling,\r\nthe lodging was too, and there was nothing to complain about in the\r\nclothing. He was severe in the way of flogging. I ran away six times\r\nmyself, but was forced to go back again, as I had no money and no\r\nfriend in the world. When I first ran away I complained to Mr. ---- the\r\nmagistrate, and he was going to give me six weeks. He said it would do\r\nme good; but Mr. ---- interfered, and I was let go. I don’t know what\r\nhe was going to give me six weeks for, unless it was for having a black\r\neye that my master had given me with the stirrup. Of the seven only\r\none served his time out. He let me off two years before my time was\r\nup, as we couldn’t agree. The mischief of taking so many apprentices\r\nis this:--The master gets money with them from the parish, and can\r\nfeed them much as he likes as to quality and quantity; and if they run\r\naway soon, the master’s none the worse, for he’s got the money; and so\r\nboys are sent out to turn vagrants when they run away, as such boys\r\nhave no friends. Of us seven boys (at the wages our employer got) one\r\ncould earn 19_s._, another 15_s._, another 12_s._, another 10_s._,\r\nand the rest not less than 8_s._ each, for all worked sixteen hours\r\na day--that’s 4_l._ 8_s._ a week for the seven, or 225_l._ 10_s._ a\r\nyear. You must recollect I reckon this on nearly the best wages in\r\nthe women’s trade. My employer you may call a sweater, and he made\r\nmoney fast, though he drank a good deal. We seldom saw him when he was\r\ndrunk; but he _did_ pitch into us when he was getting sober. Look how\r\neasily such a man with apprentices can undersell others when he wants\r\nto work as cheap as possible for the great slop warehouses. They serve\r\nhaberdashers so cheap that oft enough it’s starvation wages for the\r\nsame shops.”\r\n\r\nAkin to the system of using a large number of apprentices is that of\r\n_employing boys and girls_ to displace the work of men, at the less\r\nlaborious parts of the trade.\r\n\r\n“It is probable,” said a working shoemaker to me, “that, independent\r\nof apprentices, 200 additional hands are added to our already\r\nover-burdened trade yearly. Sewing boys soon learn the use of the\r\nknife. Plenty of poor men will offer to finish them for a pound and a\r\nmonth’s work; and men, for a few shillings and a few weeks’ work, will\r\nteach other boys to sew. There are many of the wives of chamber-masters\r\nteach girls entirely to make children’s work for a pound and a few\r\nmonths’ work, and there are many in Bethnal-green who have learnt the\r\nbusiness in this way. These teach some other members of their families,\r\nand then actually set up in business in opposition to those who taught\r\nthem, and in cutting offer their work for sale at a much lower rate of\r\nprofit; and shopkeepers in town and country, having circulars sent to\r\nsolicit custom, will have their goods from a warehouse that will serve\r\nthem cheapest; then the warehouseman will have them cheap from the\r\nmanufacturer; and he in his turn cuts down the wages of the workpeople,\r\nwho fear to refuse offers at the warehouse price, knowing the low rate\r\nat which chamber-masters will serve the warehouse.”\r\n\r\nAs in all trades where lowness of wages is the rule, the boy system of\r\nlabour prevails among the cheap cabinet-workers. It prevails, however,\r\namong the garret-masters, by very many of them having one, two, three\r\nor four youths to help them, and so the number of boys thus employed\r\nthrough the whole trade is considerable. This refers principally to\r\nthe general cabinet trade. In the fancy trade the number is greater,\r\nas the boys’ labour is more readily available; but in this trade the\r\ngreatest number of apprentices is employed by such warehousemen as\r\nare manufacturers, as some at the East end are, or rather by the men\r\nthat they constantly keep at work. Of these men, one has now eight and\r\nanother fourteen boys in his service, some apprenticed, some merely\r\n“engaged” and dischargeable at pleasure. A sharp boy, in six or eight\r\nmonths, becomes “handy;” but four out of five of the workmen thus\r\nbrought up can do nothing well but their own particular branch, and\r\nthat only well as far as celerity in production is considered.\r\n\r\nIt is these boys who are put to make, or as a master of the better\r\nclass distinguished to me, not to _make_ but to put together, ladies’\r\nwork-boxes at 5_d._ a piece, the boy receiving 2-1/2_d._ a box.\r\n‘Such boxes,’ said another workman, ‘are nailed together; there’s no\r\ndove-tailing, nothing of what I call _work_, or workmanship, as you\r\nsay, about them, but the deal’s nailed together, and the veneer’s\r\ndabbed on, and if the deal’s covered, why the thing passes. The worst\r\nof it is, that people don’t understand either good work or good wood.\r\nPolish them up and they look well. Besides--and that’s another bad\r\nthing, for it encourages bad work--there’s no stress on a lady’s\r\nwork-box, as on a chair or a sofa, and so bad work lasts far too long,\r\nthough not half so long as good; in solids especially, if not in\r\nveneers.’\r\n\r\nTo such a pitch is this demand for children’s labour carried, that\r\nthere is a market in Bethnal-green, where boys and girls stand twice\r\na week to be hired as binders and sewers. Hence it will be easily\r\nunderstood that it is impossible for the skilled and grown artizan\r\nto compete with the labour of mere children, who are thus literally\r\nbrought into the market to undersell him!\r\n\r\nConcerning this market for boys and girls, in Bethnal-green, I\r\nreceived, during my inquiries into the boot and shoe trade, the\r\nfollowing statements from shopkeepers on the spot:--\r\n\r\n“Mr. H---- has lived there sixteen years. The market-days are Monday\r\nand Tuesday mornings, from seven to nine. The ages of persons who\r\nassemble there vary from ten to twenty, and they are often of the worst\r\ncharacter, and a decided nuisance to the inhabitants. A great many of\r\nboth sexes congregate together, and most market days there are three\r\nfemales to one male. They consist of sewing boys, shoe-binders, winders\r\nfor weavers, and girls for all kinds of slop needlework, girls for\r\ndomestic work, nursing children, &c. No one can testify, for a fact,\r\nthat they (the females) are prostitutes; but, by their general conduct,\r\nthey are fit for anything. The market, some years since, was held\r\nat the top of Abbey-street; but, on account of the nuisance, it was\r\nremoved to the other end of Abbey-street. When the schools were built,\r\nthe nuisance became so intolerable that it was removed to a railway\r\narch in White-street, Bethnal-green. There are two policemen on market\r\nmornings to keep order, but my informant says they require four to\r\nmaintain anything like subjection.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut _family work, or the conjoint labour of a workman’s wife and\r\nchildren_, is an equally extensive cause of surplus and casual labour.\r\n\r\nA small master, working, perhaps, upon goods to be supplied at the\r\nlowest rates to wholesale warehousemen, will often contribute to this\r\nresult by the way in which he brings up his children. It is less\r\nexpensive to him to teach them his own business, and he may even reap\r\na profit from their labour, than to have them brought up to some\r\nother calling. I met with an instance of this in an inquiry among the\r\ntoy-makers. A maker of common toys brought up five children to his own\r\ntrade, for boys and girls can be made useful in such labour at an early\r\nage. His business fell off rapidly, which he attributed to the great\r\nand numerous packages of cheap toys imported from Germany, Holland, and\r\nFrance, after the lowering of the duty by Sir Robert Peel’s tariff.\r\nThe chief profit to the toy-maker was derived from the labour, as the\r\nmaterial was of trifling cost. He found, on the change in his trade,\r\nthat he could not employ all his family. His fellow tradesmen, he said,\r\nwere in the same predicament; and thus surplus hands were created, so\r\nleading to casualty in labour.\r\n\r\n“The system which has, I believe, the worst effect on the women’s trade\r\nin the boot and shoe business throughout England is,” I said in the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_, “chamber-mastering. There are between 300 and\r\n400 chamber-masters. Commonly the man has a wife, and three or four\r\nchildren, ten years old or upwards. The wife cuts out the work for\r\nthe binders, the husband does the knife-work, the children sew with\r\nuncommon rapidity. The husband, when the work is finished at night,\r\ngoes out with it, though wet and cold, and perhaps hungry--his wife\r\nand children waiting his return. He returns sometimes, having sold his\r\nwork at cost price, or not cleared 1_s._ 6_d._ for the day’s labour of\r\nhimself and family. In the winter, by this means, the shopkeepers and\r\nwarehouses can take the advantage of the chamber-master, buying the\r\nwork at their own price. By this means haberdashers’ shops are supplied\r\nwith boots, shoes, and slippers; they can sell women’s boots at 1_s._\r\n9_d._ per pair; shoes, 1_s._ 3_d._ per pair; children’s, 6_d._, 8_d._,\r\nand 9_d._ per pair, getting a good profit, having bought them of the\r\npoor chamber-master for almost nothing, and he glad to sell them at any\r\nprice, late at night, his children wanting bread, and he having walked\r\nabout for hours, in vain trying to get a fair price for them; thus,\r\nwomen and children labour as well as husbands and fathers, and, with\r\ntheir combined labours, they only obtain a miserable living.”\r\n\r\nThe labour of the wife, and indeed the whole family--family work, as\r\nit is called--is attended with the same evil to a trade, introducing\r\na large supply of fresh hands to the labour market, and so tending to\r\nglut with workpeople each trade into which they are introduced, and\r\nthus to increase the casual labour, and decrease the earnings of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n“The only means of escape from the inevitable poverty,” I said in the\r\nsame letters, “which sooner or later overwhelms those in connection\r\nwith the cheap shoe trade, seems to the workmen to be by the employment\r\nof his whole family as soon as his children are able to be put to the\r\ntrade--and yet this only increases the very depression that he seeks to\r\navoid. I give the statement of such a man residing in the suburbs of\r\nLondon, and working with three girls to help him:--\r\n\r\n“‘I have known the business,’ he said, ‘many years, but was not brought\r\nup to it. I took it up because my wife’s father was in the trade, and\r\ntaught me. I was a weaver originally, but it is a bad business, and I\r\nhave been in this trade seventeen years. Then I had only my wife and\r\nmyself able to work. At that time my wife and I, by hard work, could\r\nearn 1_l._ a week; on the same work we could not now earn 12_s._ a\r\nweek. As soon as the children grew old enough the falling off in the\r\nwages compelled us to put them to work one by one--as soon as a child\r\ncould make threads. One began to do that between eight and nine. I have\r\nhad a large family, and with very hard work too. We have had to lie\r\non straw oft enough. Now, three daughters, my wife, and myself work\r\ntogether, in chamber-mastering; the whole of us may earn, one week with\r\nanother, 28_s._ a week, and out of that I have eight to support. Out of\r\nthat 28_s._ I have to pay for grindery and candles, which cost me 1_s._\r\na week the year through. I now make children’s shoes for the wholesale\r\nhouses and anybody. About two years ago I travelled from Thomas-street,\r\nBethnal-green, to Oxford-street, “on the hawk.” I then positively had\r\nnothing in my inside, and in Holborn I had to lean against a house,\r\nthrough weakness from hunger. I was compelled, as I could sell nothing\r\nat that end of the town, to walk down to Whitechapel at ten at night.\r\nI went into a shop near Mile-end turnpike, and the same articles\r\n(children’s patent leather shoes) that I received 8_s._ a dozen for\r\nfrom the wholesale houses, I was compelled to sell to the shopkeeper\r\nfor 6_s._ 6_d._ This is a very frequent case--very frequent--with\r\npersons circumstanced as I am, and so trade is injured and only some\r\nhard man gains by it.’”\r\n\r\nHere is the statement of a worker at “fancy cabinet” work on the same\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n“The most on us has got large families. We put the children to work as\r\nsoon as we can. My little girl began about six, but about eight or nine\r\nis the usual age.” _“Oh, poor little things,” said the wife, “they are\r\nobliged to begin the very minute they can use their fingers at all.”_\r\n“The most of the cabinet-makers of the East end have from five to six\r\nin family, and they are generally all at work for them. The small\r\nmasters mostly marry when they are turned of 20. You see our trade’s\r\ncoming to such a pass, that unless a man has children to help him he\r\ncan’t live at all. _I’ve worked more than a month together, and the\r\nlongest night’s rest I’ve had has been an hour and a quarter; aye, and\r\nI’ve been up three nights a week besides._ I’ve had my children lying\r\nill, and been obliged to wait on them into the bargain. You see, we\r\ncouldn’t live if it wasn’t for the labour of our children, though it\r\nmakes ’em--poor little things!--old people long afore they are growed\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I stood at this bench,” said the wife, “with my child, only ten\r\nyears of age, from four o’clock on Friday morning till ten minutes\r\npast seven in the evening, without a bit to eat or drink. I never sat\r\ndown a minute from the time I began till I finished my work, and then\r\nI went out to sell what I had done. I walked all the way from here\r\n[Shoreditch] down to the Lowther Arcade, to get rid of the articles.”\r\n_Here she burst out in a violent flood of tears, saying, “Oh, sir, it\r\nis hard to be obliged to labour from morning till night as we do, all\r\nof us, little ones and all, and yet not be able to live by it either.”_\r\n\r\n“And you see the worst of it is, this here children’s labour is of such\r\nvalue now in our trade, that there’s more brought into the business\r\nevery year, so that it’s really for all the world _like breeding\r\nslaves_. Without my children I don’t know how we should be able to get\r\nalong.” “There’s that little thing,” said the man, pointing to the girl\r\nten years of age before alluded to, as she sat at the edge of the bed,\r\n“why she works regularly every day from six in the morning till ten at\r\nnight. She never goes to school. We can’t spare her. There’s schools\r\nenough about here for a penny a week, but we could not afford to keep\r\nher without working. If I’d ten more children I should be obliged to\r\nemploy them all the same way, and there’s hundreds and thousands of\r\nchildren now slaving at this business. There’s the M----’s; they have\r\na family of eight, and the youngest to the oldest of all works at the\r\nbench; and the oldest ain’t fourteen. I’m sure, of the 2500 small\r\nmasters in the cabinet line, you may safely say that 2000 of them, at\r\nthe very least, has from five to six in family, _and that’s upwards of_\r\n12,000 _children that’s been put to the trade since prices has come\r\ndown_. Twenty years ago I don’t think there was a child at work in our\r\nbusiness; and I am sure there is not a small master now whose whole\r\nfamily doesn’t assist him. But what I want to know is, what’s to become\r\nof the 12,000 children when they’re growed up, and come regular into\r\nthe trade? Here are all my young ones growing up without being taught\r\nanything but a business that I know they must starve at.”\r\n\r\nIn answer to my inquiry as to what dependence he had in case of\r\nsickness, “Oh, bless you,” he said, “there’s nothing but the parish\r\nfor us. I _did_ belong to a Benefit Society about four years ago, but\r\nI couldn’t keep up my payments any longer. I was in the society above\r\nfive-and-twenty year, and then was obliged to leave it after all. I\r\ndon’t know of one as belongs to any Friendly Society, and I don’t think\r\nthere is a man as can afford it in our trade now. They must all go to\r\nthe workhouse when they’re sick or old.”\r\n\r\nThe following is from a journeyman tailor, concerning the employment of\r\nwomen in his trade:--\r\n\r\n“When I first began working at this branch, there were but very few\r\nfemales employed in it: a few white waistcoats were given out to\r\nthem, under the idea that women would make them cleaner than men--and\r\nso indeed they can. But since the last five years the sweaters have\r\nemployed females upon cloth, silk, and satin waistcoats as well, and\r\nbefore that time the idea of a woman making a cloth waistcoat would\r\nhave been scouted. But since the increase of the puffing and the\r\nsweating system, masters and sweaters have sought everywhere for such\r\nhands as would do the work below the regular ones. Hence the wife has\r\nbeen made to compete with the husband, and the daughter with the wife:\r\nthey all learn the waistcoat business, and must all get a living. If\r\nthe man will not reduce the price of his labour to that of the female,\r\nwhy he must remain unemployed; and if the full-grown woman will not\r\ntake the work at the same price as the young girl, why she must remain\r\nwithout any. The female hands, I can confidently state, have been\r\nsought out and introduced to the business by the sweaters, from a\r\ndesire on their part continually to ferret out hands who will do the\r\nwork cheaper than others. The effect that this continual reduction has\r\nhad upon me is this: Before the year 1844 I could live comfortably,\r\nand keep my wife and children (I had five in family) by my own labour.\r\nMy wife then attended to her domestic and family duties; but since\r\nthat time, owing to the reduction in prices, she has been compelled\r\nto resort to her needle, as well as myself, for her living.” [On the\r\ntable was a bundle of crape and bombazine ready to be made up into\r\na dress.] “I cannot afford now to let her remain idle--that is, if I\r\nwish to live, and keep my children out of the streets, and pay my way.\r\nMy wife’s earnings are, upon an average, 8_s._ per week. She makes\r\ndresses. I never would teach her to make waistcoats, because I knew\r\nthe introduction of female hands had been the ruin of my trade. With\r\nthe labour of myself and wife now I can only earn 32_s._ a week, and\r\nsix years ago I could make my 36_s._ If I had a daughter I should be\r\nobliged to make her work as well, and then probably, with the labour\r\nof the three of us, we could make up at the week’s end as much money,\r\nas, up to 1844, I could get by my own single hands. My wife, since she\r\ntook to dressmaking, has become sickly from over-exertion. Her work,\r\nand her domestic and family duties altogether, are too much for her.\r\nLast night I was up all night with her, and was compelled to call in a\r\nfemale to attend her as well. The over-exertion now necessary for us to\r\nmaintain a decent appearance, has so ruined her constitution that she\r\nis not the same woman as she was. In fact, ill as she is, she has been\r\ncompelled to rise from her bed to finish a mourning-dress against time,\r\nand I myself have been obliged to give her a helping-hand, and turn to\r\nat women’s work in the same manner as the women are turning to at men’s\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n“The cause of the serious decrease in our trade,” said another tailor\r\nto me, “is the employment given to workmen at their own homes; or, in\r\nother words, to the ‘sweaters.’ The sweater is the greatest evil to\r\nus; as the sweating system increases the number of hands to an almost\r\nincredible extent--wives, sons, daughters, and extra women, all working\r\n‘long days’--that is, labouring from sixteen to eighteen hours per day,\r\nand Sundays as well. I date the decrease in the wages of the workman\r\nfrom the introduction of piece-work and giving out garments to be made\r\noff the premises of the master; for the effect of this was, that the\r\nworkman making the garment, knowing that the master could not tell\r\nwhom he got to do his work for him, employed women and children to\r\nhelp him, and paid them little or nothing for their labour. This was\r\nthe beginning of the sweating system. The workmen gradually became\r\ntransformed from journeymen into ‘middlemen,’ living by the labour of\r\nothers. Employers soon began to find that they could get garments made\r\nat a less sum than the regular price, and those tradesmen who were\r\nanxious to force their trade, by underselling their more honourable\r\nneighbours, readily availed themselves of this means of obtaining cheap\r\nlabour. The consequence was, that the sweater sought out where he could\r\nget the work done the cheapest, and so introduced a fresh stock of\r\nhands into the trade. Female labour, of course, could be had cheaper\r\nthan male, and the sweater readily availed himself of the services of\r\nwomen on that account. Hence the males who had formerly been employed\r\nupon the garments were thrown out of work by the females, and obliged\r\nto remain unemployed, unless they would reduce the price of their work\r\nto that of the women. It cannot, therefore, be said that the reduction\r\nof prices originally arose from there having been more workmen than\r\nthere was work for them to do. There was no superabundance of hands\r\nuntil female labour was generally introduced--and even if the workmen\r\nhad increased 25 per cent. more than what they were twenty years back,\r\nstill that extra number of hands would be required now to make the\r\nsame number of garments, owing to the work put into each article being\r\nat least one-fourth more than formerly. So far from the trade being\r\nover-stocked with male hands, if the work were confined to the men or\r\nthe masters’ premises, there would not be sufficient hands to do the\r\nwhole.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the last Census (1841, G.B.), out of a population of\r\n18,720,000 the proportions of the people occupied and unoccupied were\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  Occupied                                     7,800,000\r\n  Unoccupied (including women and children)   10,920,000\r\n\r\nOf those who were occupied the following were the proportions:--\r\n\r\n  Engaged in productive employments[42]        5,350,000\r\n  Engaged in non-productive employments        2,450,000\r\n\r\nOf those who were engaged in productive employments, the proportion (in\r\nround numbers) ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Men                                          3,785,000\r\n  Women                                          660,000\r\n  Boys and girls                                 905,000\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find nearly one-fifth, or 20 per cent., of our producers\r\nto be boys and girls, and upwards of 10 per cent. to be women. Such\r\nwas the state of things in 1841. In order to judge of the possible\r\nand probable condition of the labour market of the country, if this\r\nintroduction of women and children into the ranks of the labourers be\r\npersisted in, let us see what were the proportions of the 10,920,000\r\nmen, women, and children who ten years ago still remained unoccupied\r\namong us. The ratio was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Men                 275,000\r\n  Women             3,570,000\r\n  Boys and girls    7,075,000\r\n\r\nHere the unoccupied men are about 5 per cent. of the whole, the\r\nchildren nearly two-thirds, and the wives about one-third. Now it\r\nappears that out of say 19,000,000 people, 8,000,000 were, in 1841,\r\noccupied, and by far the greater number, 11,000,000, unoccupied.\r\n\r\nWho were the remaining eleven millions, and what were they doing? They,\r\nof course, consisted principally of the unemployed wives and children\r\nof the eight millions of people before specified, three millions and a\r\nhalf of the number being females of twenty years of age and upwards,\r\nand seven millions being children of both sexes under twenty. Of these\r\nchildren, four millions, according to the “age abstract,” were under\r\nten years, so that we may fairly assume that, at the time of taking\r\nthe last census, _there were very nearly seven millions of wives and\r\nchildren of a workable age still unoccupied_. Let us suppose, then,\r\nthat these seven millions of people are brought in competition with the\r\nfive million producers. What is to be the consequence? If the labour\r\nmarket be overstocked at present with only five millions of people\r\nworking for the support of nineteen millions (I speak according to the\r\nCensus of 1841), what would it be if another seven millions were to be\r\ndragged into it? And if wages are low now, and employment is precarious\r\non account of this, what will not both work and pay sink to when the\r\nnumber is again increased, and the people clamouring for employment are\r\nat least treble what they are at present? When the wife has been taught\r\nto compete for work with the husband, and son and daughter to undersell\r\ntheir own father, what will be the state of our labour market then?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the labour of wives, and children, and apprentices, is not the\r\nonly means of glutting a particular trade with hands. There is another\r\nsystem becoming every day more popular with our enterprising tradesmen,\r\nand this is the _importation of foreign labourers_. In the cheap\r\ntailoring this is made a regular practice. Cheap labour is regularly\r\nimported, not only from Ireland (the wives of sweaters making visits\r\nto the Emerald Isle for the express purpose), but small armies of\r\nworking tailors, ready to receive the lowest pittance, are continually\r\nbeing shipped into this country. That this is no exaggeration let the\r\nfollowing statement prove:--\r\n\r\n“I am a native of Pesth, having left Hungary about eight years ago.\r\nBy the custom of the country I was compelled to travel three years in\r\nforeign parts, before I could settle in my native place. I went to\r\nParis, after travelling about in the different countries of Germany.\r\nI stayed in Paris about two years. My father’s wish was that I should\r\nvisit England, and I came to London in June, 1847. I first worked for\r\na West end show shop--not _directly_ for them--but through the person\r\nwho is their middleman getting work done at what rates he could for the\r\nfirm, and obtaining the prices they allowed for making the garments.\r\nI once worked four days and a half for him, finding my own trimmings,\r\n&c., for 9_s._ For this my employer would receive 12_s._ 6_d._ He then\r\nemployed 190 hands; he _has_ employed 300. Many of those so employed\r\nset their wives, children, and others to work, some employing as many\r\nas five hands this way. The middleman keeps his carriage, and will give\r\nfifty guineas for a horse. I became unable to work from a pain in my\r\nback, from long sitting at my occupation. The doctor told me not to sit\r\nmuch, and so, as a countryman of mine was doing the same, I employed\r\nhands, making the best I could of their labour. I have now four young\r\nwomen (all Irish girls) so employed. Last week one of them received\r\n4_s._, another 4_s._ 2_d._, the other two 5_s._ each. They find their\r\nboard and lodging, but I find them a place to work in, a small room,\r\nthe rent of which I share with another tailor, who works on his own\r\naccount. There are not so many Jews come over from Hungary or Germany\r\nas from Poland. The law of travelling three years brings over many,\r\nbut not more than it did. The revolutions have brought numbers this\r\nyear and last. They are Jew tailors flying from Russian and Prussian\r\nPoland to avoid the conscription. I never knew any of these Jews go\r\nback again. _There is a constant communication among the Jews, and\r\nwhen their friends in Poland, and other places, learn they are safe in\r\nEngland, and in work and out of trouble, they come over too. I worked\r\nas a journeyman in Pesth, and got_ 2_s._ 6_d. a week, my board and\r\nwashing, and lodging, for my labour._ We lived well, everything being\r\nso cheap. The Jews come in the greatest number about Easter. They try\r\nto work their way here, most of them. Some save money here, but they\r\nnever go back; if they leave England it is to go to America.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe labour market of a particular place, however, comes to be\r\noverstocked with hands, not only from the introduction of an inordinate\r\nnumber of apprentices and women and children into the trade, as well\r\nas the importation of workmen from abroad, but the same effect is\r\nproduced by _the migration of country labourers to towns_. This,\r\nas I have before said, is specially the case in the printer’s and\r\ncarpenter’s trades, where the cheap provincial work is executed chiefly\r\nby apprentices, who, when their time is up, flock to the principal\r\ntowns, in the hopes of getting better wages than can be obtained in\r\nthe country, owing to the prevalence of the apprentice system of work\r\nin those parts. The London carpenters suffer greatly from what are\r\ncalled “improvers,” who come up to town to get perfected in their art,\r\nand work for little or no wages. The work of some of the large houses\r\nis executed mainly in this way; that of Mr. Myers was, for instance,\r\nagainst whom the men lately struck.\r\n\r\nBut the unskilled labour of towns suffers far more than the skilled\r\nfrom the above cause.\r\n\r\nThe employment of unskilled labourers in towns is being constantly\r\nrendered more casual by the migrations from the country parts.\r\nThe peasants, owing to the insufficiency of their wages, and the\r\nwretchedness of their dwellings and diet, in Wilts, Somerset, Dorset,\r\nand elsewhere, leave their native places without regret, and swell\r\nthe sum of unskilled labour in towns. This is shown by the increase\r\nof population far beyond the excess of births over deaths in those\r\ncounties where there are large manufacturing or commercial towns;\r\nwhilst in purely agricultural counties the increase of population\r\ndoes not keep pace with the excess of births. “Thus in Lancashire,”\r\nwrites Mr. Thornton, in his work on Over-Population, “the increase of\r\nthe population in the ten years ending in 1841, was 330,210, and in\r\nCheshire, 60,919; whilst the excess of births was only 150,150 in the\r\nformer, and 28,000 in the latter. In particular towns the contrast\r\nis still more striking. In Liverpool and Bristol the annual deaths\r\nactually exceed the births, so that these towns are only saved from\r\ndepopulation by their rural recruits, yet the first increased the\r\nnumber of its inhabitants in ten years by more than one-third, and\r\nthe other by more than one-sixth. In Manchester, the annual excess of\r\nbirths could only have added 19,390 to the population between 1831\r\nand 1841; the actual increase was 68,375. The number of emigrants\r\n(immigrants) into Birmingham, during the same period, may, in the same\r\nway, be estimated at 40,000; into Leeds, at 8000; into the metropolis,\r\nat 130,000. On the other hand, in Dorset, Somerset, and Devon, the\r\nactual addition to the population, in the same decennial period, was\r\nonly 15,491, 31,802, and 39,253 respectively; although the excess of\r\nbirths over deaths in the same counties was about 20,000, 38,600, and\r\n48,700.”\r\n\r\nThe unskilled labour market suffers, again, from the depression of\r\nalmost any branch of skilled labour; for whatever branch of labour be\r\ndepressed, and men so be deprived of a sufficiency of employment, one\r\nespecial result ensues--the unskilled labour market is glutted. The\r\nskilled labourer, a tailor, for instance, may be driven to work for the\r\nwretched pittance of an East end slop-tailor, but he cannot “turn his\r\nhand” to any other description of skilled labour. He cannot say, “I\r\nwill make billiard-tables, or book-cases, or boots, or razors;” so that\r\nthere is no resource for him but in unskilled labour. The Spitalfields\r\nweavers have often sought dock labour; the turners of the same\r\nlocality, whose bobbins were once in great demand by the silk-winders,\r\nand for the fringes of upholsterers, have done the same; and in this\r\nway the increase of casual labour increases the poverty of the poor,\r\nand so tends directly to the increase of pauperism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now seen what a vast number of surplus labourers may be\r\nproduced by an extension of time, rate, or mode of working, as well as\r\nby the increase of the hands, by other means than by _the increase of\r\nthe people themselves_. If, however, we are increasing our workers at\r\na greater rate than we are increasing the means of work, the excess of\r\nworkmen must, of course, remain unemployed. But are we doing this?\r\n\r\nLet us test the matter on the surest data. In the first instance let us\r\nestimate the increase of population, both according to the calculations\r\nof the late Mr. Rickman and the returns of the several censuses. The\r\nfirst census, I may observe, was taken in 1801, and has been regularly\r\ncontinued at intervals of ten years.

The average increase\r\nin England and Wales for the last 50 years may, however, be said to be\r\n1·5 per cent. per annum, the population having doubled itself during\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\nHow, then, does this rate of increase among the people, and\r\nconsequently the labourers and artizans of the country, correspond with\r\nthe rate of increase in the production of commodities, or, in plain\r\nEnglish, the means of employment? _This_ is the main inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe only means of determining the total amount of commodities produced,\r\nand consequently the quantity of work done in the country, is from\r\nofficial returns, submitted to the Parliament and the public as part\r\nof the “revenue” of the kingdom. These afford a broad and accurate\r\nbasis for the necessary statistics; and to get rid of any speculating\r\nor calculating on the subject, I will confine my notice to such\r\ncommodities; giving, however, further information bearing on the\r\nsubject, but still derived from official sources, so that there may be\r\nno doubt on the matter. The facts in connection with this part of the\r\nsubject are exhibited in the table given in the next page.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the articles there specified supply the elements of\r\ntrade and manufacture in furnishing the materials of our clothing, in\r\nall its appliances of decency, comfort, and luxury. The table relates,\r\nmoreover, to our commerce with other countries--to the ships which find\r\nprofitable employment, and give such employment to our people, in the\r\naggregate commerce of the nation. Under almost every head, it will be\r\nseen, the increase in the means of labour has been more extensive than\r\nhas the increase in the number of labourers; in some instances the\r\ndifference is wide indeed.\r\n\r\nThe annual rate of increase among the population has been ·9 per\r\ncent. From 1801 to 1841 the population of the kingdom at the outside\r\ncannot be said to have doubled itself. Yet the productions in cotton\r\ngoods _were not less than ten times greater in 1851 than in 1801_. The\r\nincrease in the use of wool from 1821 to 1851 was more than sixfold;\r\nthat of the population, I may repeat, _not_ twofold. In _twenty_ years\r\n(1831 to 1851) the hides were more than doubled in amount as a means of\r\nproduction; in _fifty_ years the population has not increased to the\r\nsame amount. Can any one, then, contend that the labouring population\r\nhas extended itself at a greater rate than the means of labour, or\r\nthat the vast mass of surplus labour throughout the country is owing\r\nto the working classes having increased more rapidly than the means of\r\nemploying them?\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE INCREASE IN THE PRODUCTIONS AND COMMERCE OF THE\r\nUNITED KINGDOM, FROM 1801-1850.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------+----------+----------+-------------+-----------+----------+\r\n                                    |          |          |  Increase   |           |          |\r\n                                    |          |          |and Decrease |           |Increase  |\r\n         +  denotes increase.       |          |          |per Cent.    |           |per Cent. |\r\n         *     „    decrease.       |  1801.   |  1811.   |  from 1801  |   1821.   |from 1811 |\r\n                                    |          |          |  to 1811.   |           |to 1821.  |\r\n  ----------------------------------+----------+----------+-------------+-----------+----------+\r\n  Soap                    in lbs.   |55,500,000|80,000,000|    + 44     | 97,000,000|  + 21    |\r\n  Cotton                    „       |56,000,000|92,000,000|    + 64     |137,000,000|  + 49    |\r\n  Wool                      „       |          |          |             | 10,000,000|          |\r\n  Silk                      „       | 1,000,000| 1,500,000|    + 50     |  2,250,000|  + 50    |\r\n  Flax                      „       |          |          |             | 55,000,000|          |\r\n  Hemp                      „       |          |          |             |           |          |\r\n  Hides                     „       |          |          |             |           |          |\r\n  Official Value of Exports[52] in £|24,500,000|21,750,000|    * 11     | 40,250,000|  + 85    |\r\n  Official Value of Imports        „|          |25,500,000|             | 29,750,000|  + 17    |\r\n  Tonnage of Vessels belonging      |          |          |             |           |          |\r\n    to British Empire               |          |          |             |  2,560,203|          |\r\n  Tonnage of Vessels entering       |          |          |             |           |          |\r\n    Ports                           |          |          |             |  1,895,000|          |\r\n  ----------------------------------+----------+----------+-------------+-----------+----------+\r\n\r\n  +-----------+------------+------------+---------+------------+---------+---------+-----------\r\n  |           |  Increase  |            |         |            |         |         |\r\n  |           |and Decrease|            |Increase |            |Increase | Total   | Average\r\n  |           |  per Cent. |            |per Cent.|            |per Cent.|Increase |  Annual\r\n  |   1831.   |  from 1812 |   1841.    |from 1831|   1850.    |from 1841|per Cent.| Increase\r\n  |           |  to 1831.  |            |to 1841. |            |to 1850. |         | per Cent.\r\n  +-----------+------------+------------+---------+-----------+----------+---------+-----------\r\n  |127,500,000|    + 31    |170,500,000 |   + 34  |205,000,000 |   20    |   269   |    5·3\r\n  |273,000,009|    + 99    |437,000,000 |   + 60  |664,700,000 |   52    |  1087   |   21·7\r\n  | 30,000,000|    + 200   | 53,000,000 |   + 77  | 72,675,000 |   37    |   627   |   20·9\r\n  |  4,250,000|    + 89    |  5,000,000 |   + 18  |  7,159,000 |   43    |   616   |   12·3\r\n  |104,000,000|    + 89    |151,000,000 |   + 45  |204,000,000 |   35    |   271   |    9·0\r\n  | 56,500,000|            | 73,000,000 |   + 29  |117,447,000 |   61    |   108   |    5·4\r\n  | 26,000,000|            | 51,000,000 |   + 96  | 66,300,000 |   30    |   155   |    7·7\r\n  | 60,000,000|    + 49    |101,750,000 |   + 70  |197,309,000 |   94    |   705   |   14·1\r\n  | 48,250,000|    + 62    | 62,750,000 |   + 30  |100,460,000 |   60    |   294   |    7·3\r\n  |           |            |            |         |            |         |         |\r\n  |  2,581,964|    + 1     |  3,512,480 |   + 36  |  4,232,962 |   21    |    65   |    2·2\r\n  |           |            |            |         |            |         |         |\r\n  |  3,241,927|    + 71    |  4,652,376 |   + 44  |  7,110,476 |   53    |   274   |    9·1\r\n  +-----------+------------+------------+---------+------------+---------+---------+-----------\r\n\r\nThus, it is evident, that the means of labour have increased at\r\na more rapid pace than the labouring population. But the increase\r\nin “property” of the country, in that which is sometimes called the\r\n“staple” property, being the assured possessions of the class of\r\nproprietors or capitalists, as well as in the profits, prove that,\r\nif the labourers of the country have been hungering for want of\r\nemployment, at least the wealth of the nation has kept pace with the\r\nincrease of the people, while the profits of trade have exceeded it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF THE PROPERTY AND INCOME OF GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n                         Property assessed    Annual Profits\r\n  Year.                   to Property-tax.      of Trade.\r\n  1815                       £60,000,000       £37,000,000\r\n  1842                        95,250,000\r\n  1844                           ...             60,000,000\r\n  Increase                    58 per cent.\r\n     „                           ...            62 per cent.\r\n  Annual rate of increase      1·7 per cent.     1·7 per cent.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find, that the property assessed to the property tax has\r\nincreased 35,250,000_l._ in 27 years, from 1815 to 1842, or upwards of\r\n1,000,000_l._ sterling a year; this is at the rate of 1·7 per cent.\r\nevery year, whereas the population of Great Britain has increased at\r\nthe rate of only 1·4 per cent. per annum. But the amount of assessment\r\nunder the property tax, it should be borne in mind, does not represent\r\nthe full value of the possessions, so that among this class of\r\nproprietors there is far greater wealth than the returns show.\r\n\r\nAs regards the annual profits of trade, the increase between the years\r\n1815 and 1844 has been 23,000,000_l._ in 29 years. This is at the rate\r\nof 1·7 per cent. per annum, and the annual increase in the population\r\nof Great Britain is only 1·4 per cent. But the amount of the profits of\r\ntrade is unquestionably greater than appears in the financial tables of\r\nthe revenue of the country; consequently there is a greater increase of\r\nwealth over population than the figures indicate.\r\n\r\nThe above returns show the following results:--\r\n\r\n                                     Increase\r\n                                     per Cent.\r\n                                      per Ann.\r\n  Population of the United Kingdom         ·9\r\n  Productions from                    21 to 5\r\n  Exports                                  14\r\n  Imports                                   5\r\n  Shipping entering Ports                   9\r\n  Property                                1·7\r\n  Profits of trade                        1·7\r\n\r\nFar, very far indeed then, beyond the increase of the population, has\r\nbeen the increase of the wealth and work of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after this imposing array of wealth, let us contemplate\r\nthe reverse of the picture: let us inquire if, while we have been\r\nincreasing in riches and productions far more rapidly than we have been\r\nincreasing in people and producers--let us inquire, I say, if we have\r\nbeen numerically increasing also in the sad long lists of paupers and\r\ncriminals. Has our progress in poverty and crime been “_pari passu_,”\r\nor been more than commensurate in the rapidity of its strides?\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF PAUPERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES.[53]\r\n\r\n  ------+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+-------------\r\n        |Number of        |Numerical Increase |               |\r\n        |Paupers relieved,|   and Decrease.   |Annual Increase|Increase per\r\n  Years.| Quarters        |+ denotes Increase.|  and Decrease |Cent. from\r\n        | ending Lady-day.|*    „    Decrease.|    per Cent.  |1840 to 1848\r\n  ------+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+ = 56.\r\n   1840 |    1,199,529    |                   |               | Annual\r\n   1841 |    1,299,048    |     + 99,519      |    +  8       | Increase,\r\n   1842 |    1,427,187    |     + 128,139     |    + 10       | 7 per Cent.\r\n   1843 |    1,539,490    |     + 112,303     |    +  8       |\r\n   1844 |    1,477,561    |     + 938,071     |    + 60       |\r\n   1845 |    1,470,970    |     *   6,591     |    *  0·4     |\r\n   1846 |    1,332,089    |     *  38,881     |    *  3       |\r\n   1847 |    1,721,350    |     + 389,261     |    + 29       |\r\n   1848 |    1,876,541    |     + 155,191     |    +  9       |\r\n  ------+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+-----------\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have an increase of 56 per cent. in less than ten years,\r\nthough the increase of the population of England and Wales, in the same\r\ntime, was but 13 per cent.; and let it be remembered that the increase\r\nof upwards of 650,000 paupers, in nine years, has accrued since the New\r\nPoor Law has been in what may be considered full working; a law which\r\nmany were confident would result in a diminution of pauperism, and\r\nwhich certainly cannot be charged with offering the least encouragement\r\nto it.

The above are the bare facts of the country--it\r\nis for the reader to explain them as he pleases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs yet we have dealt with those causes of casual labour only which may\r\ninduce a surplusage of labourers without any _decrease taking place\r\nin the quantity of work_. We have seen, first, how the number of the\r\nunemployed may be increased either by altering the hours, rate, or mode\r\nof working, or else by changing the term of hiring, and this while the\r\nnumber of labourers remains the same; and, secondly, we have seen how\r\nthe same results may ensue from increasing the number of labourers,\r\nwhile the conditions of working and hiring are unaltered. Under both\r\nthese circumstances, however, the actual quantity of work to be done\r\nin the country has been supposed to undergo no change whatever; and\r\nat present we have to point out not only how the amount of surplus,\r\nand, consequently, of casual labour, in the kingdom, may be increased\r\nby _a decrease of the work_, but also how the work itself may be made\r\nto decrease. To know the causes of the one we must ascertain the\r\nantecedents of the other. What, then, are the circumstances inducing\r\na decrease in the quantity of work? and, consequently, what the\r\ncircumstances inducing an increase in the amount of surplus and casual\r\nlabour?\r\n\r\nIn the first place we may induce a large amount of casual labour _in\r\nparticular districts_, not by decreasing the gross quantity of work\r\nrequired by the country, but by merely shifting the work into new\r\nquarters, and so decreasing the quantity in the ordinary localities.\r\n“The west of England,” says Mr. Dodd, in his account of the textile\r\nmanufactures of Great Britain, “was formerly, and continued to be till\r\na comparatively recent period, the most important clothing district in\r\nEngland. The changes which the woollen manufacture, as respects both\r\nlocalization and mode of management, has been and is now undergoing,\r\nare very remarkable. Some years ago the ‘west of England cloths’ were\r\nthe test of excellence in this manufacture; while the productions of\r\nYorkshire were deemed of a coarser and cheaper character. At present,\r\nalthough the western counties have not deteriorated in their product,\r\nthe West Riding of Yorkshire has made giant strides, by which equal\r\nskill in every department has been attained; while the commercial\r\nadvantages resulting from coal-mines, from water-power, from canals\r\nand railroads, and from vicinage to the eastern port of Hull and the\r\nwestern port of Liverpool, give to the West Riding a power which\r\nGloucestershire and Somersetshire cannot equal. The steam-engine,\r\ntoo, and various machines for facilitating some of the manufacturing\r\nprocesses, have been more readily introduced into the former than into\r\nthe latter; a circumstance which, even without reference to other\r\npoints of comparison, is sufficient to account for much of the recent\r\nadvance in the north.”\r\n\r\nOf late years the products of many of the west of England clothing\r\ndistricts have considerably declined. Shepton Mallet, Frome and\r\nTrowbridge, for instance, which were at one time the seats of a\r\nflourishing manufacture for cloth, have now but little employment for\r\nthe workmen in those parts; and so with other towns. “At several places\r\nin Wiltshire, Somersetshire, and Gloucestershire, and others of the\r\nwestern counties,” says Mr. Thornton, “most of the cottagers, fifty\r\nyears ago, were weavers, whose chief dependence was their looms, though\r\nthey worked in the field at harvest time and other busy seasons. By so\r\ndoing they kept down the wages of agricultural labourers, who had no\r\nother employment; and now that they have themselves become dependent\r\nupon agriculture, in consequence of the removal of the woollen\r\nmanufacture from the cottage to the factory” [as well as to the north\r\nof England], “these reduced wages have become their own portion also;”\r\nor, in other words, since the shifting of the woollen manufacture in\r\nthese parts, the quantity of casual labour in the cultivation of the\r\nland has been augmented.\r\n\r\nThe same effect takes place, of course, if the work be shifted to\r\nthe Continent, instead of merely to another part of our own country.\r\nThis has been the main cause of the misery of the straw-plaiters of\r\nBuckinghamshire and Bedfordshire. “During the last war,” says the\r\nauthor before quoted, “there were examples of women (the wives and\r\nchildren of labouring men) earning as much as 22_s._ a week. The\r\nprofits of this employment have been so much reduced by the competition\r\nof Leghorn hats and bonnets, that a straw-plaiter cannot earn much more\r\nthan 2_s._ 6_d._ in the week.”\r\n\r\nBut the work of particular localities may not only decrease, and the\r\ncasual labour, in those parts, increase in the same proportion, by\r\nshifting it to other localities (either at home or abroad), even while\r\nthe gross quantity of work required by the nation remains the same,\r\nbut the quantity of work may be less than ordinary at _a particular\r\ntime_, even while the same gross quantity annually required undergoes\r\nno change. This is the case in those periodical gluts which arise from\r\nover-production, in the cotton and other trades. The manufacturers, in\r\nsuch cases, have been increasing the supplies at a too rapid rate in\r\nproportion to the demand of the markets, so that, though there be no\r\ndecrease in the requirements of the country, there ultimately accrues\r\nsuch a surplus of commodities beyond the wants and means of the people,\r\nthat the manufacturers are compelled to stop producing until such time\r\nas the regular demand carries off the extra supply. And during all this\r\ntime either the labourers have to work half-time at half-pay, or else\r\nthey are thrown out of employment altogether.\r\n\r\nThus far we have proceeded in the assumption that the actual quantity\r\nof work required by the nation _does not decrease in the aggregate, but\r\nonly in particular places or at particular times_, owing to a greater\r\nquantity than usual being done in other places or at other times[54].\r\nWe have still to consider what are the circumstances which tend to\r\n_diminish the gross quantity of work required by the country_. To\r\nunderstand these we must know the conditions on which all work depends;\r\nthese are simply the conditions of demand and supply, and hence to\r\nknow what it is that regulates the demand for commodities, and what it\r\nis that regulates the supply of them, is also to know what it is that\r\nregulates the quantity of work required by the nation.\r\n\r\nLet me begin with the decrease of work arising from a _decrease of the\r\ndemand_ for certain commodities. This decrease of demand may proceed\r\nfrom one of three causes:--\r\n\r\n  1. An increase of cost.\r\n  2. A change of taste or fashion.\r\n  3. A change of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe _increase of cost_ may be brought about either by an increase in\r\nthe expense of production or by a tax laid upon the article, as in\r\nthe case of hair-powder, before quoted. Of the _change of taste or\r\nfashion_, as a means of decreasing the demand for a certain article\r\nof manufacture, and, consequently, of a particular form of labour,\r\nmany instances have already been given; to these the following may\r\nbe added:--“In Dorsetshire,” says Mr. Thornton, “the making of wire\r\nshirt-buttons (now in a great measure superseded by the use of\r\nmother-o’-pearl) once employed great numbers of women and children.” So\r\nit has been with the manufacture of metal coat-buttons; the change to\r\nsilk has impoverished hundreds.\r\n\r\nThe decrease of work arising from a _change of circumstances_ may be\r\nseen in the fluctuations of the iron trade; in the railway excitement\r\nthe demand for labour in the iron districts was at least tenfold as\r\ngreat as it is at present, and so again with the demand for arms during\r\nwar time; at such periods the quantity of work in that particular line\r\nat Birmingham is necessarily increased, while the contrary effects,\r\nof course, ensue immediately the requirements cease, and a large\r\nmass of surplus and casual hands is the result. It is the same with\r\nthe soldiers themselves, as with the gun and sword makers; on the\r\ndisbanding of certain portions of the army at the conclusion of a\r\nwar, a vast amount of surplus labourers are poured into the country\r\nto compete with those already in work, and either to drag down their\r\nweekly earnings, or else, by obtaining _casual_ employment in their\r\nstead, to reduce the gross quantity of work accruing to each, and so\r\nto render their incomes not only less in amount but less constant and\r\nregular. Within the last few weeks no less than 1000 policemen employed\r\nduring the Exhibition have been discharged, of course with a like\r\nresult to the labour market.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances tending to _diminish the supply_ of certain\r\ncommodities, are--\r\n\r\n  1. Want of capital.\r\n  2. Want of materials.\r\n  3. Want of labourers.\r\n  4. Want of opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe _decrease of the quantity of capital_ in a trade may be brought\r\nabout by several means: it may be produced by a want of security felt\r\namong the moneyed classes, as at the time of revolutions, political\r\nagitations, commercial depressions, or panics; or it may be produced\r\nby a deficiency of enterprise after the bursting of certain commercial\r\n“bubbles,” or the decline of particular manias for speculation, as on\r\nthe cessation of the railway excitement; so, again, it may be brought\r\nabout by a failure of the ordinary produce of the year, as with bad\r\nharvests.\r\n\r\nThe _decrease of the quantity of materials_, as tending to diminish the\r\nsupply of certain commodities, may be seen in the failure of the cotton\r\ncrops, which, of course, deprive the cotton manufacturers of their\r\nordinary quantity of work. The same diminution in the ordinary supply\r\nof particular articles ensues when the men engaged in the production\r\nof them “strike” either for an advance of wages, or more generally to\r\nresist the attempt of some cutting employer to reduce their ordinary\r\nearnings; and lastly, a like decrease of work necessarily ensues when\r\nthe _opportunity of working is changed_. Some kinds of work, as we\r\nhave already seen, depend on the weather--on either the wind, rain, or\r\ntemperature; while other kinds can only be pursued at certain seasons\r\nof the year, as brick-making, building, and the like; hence, on the\r\ncessation of the opportunities for working in these trades, there is\r\nnecessarily a great decrease in the quantity of work, and consequently\r\na large increase in the amount of surplus and therefore casual labour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now, I believe, exhausted the several causes of that vast\r\nnational evil--casual labour. We have seen that it depends,\r\n\r\n First, upon certain times and seasons, fashions and accidents, which\r\n tend to cause a periodical briskness or slackness in different\r\n employments;\r\n\r\n And secondly, upon the number of surplus labourers in the country.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances inducing surplus labour we have likewise ascertained\r\nto be three.\r\n\r\n 1. An alteration in the hours, rate, or mode of working, as well as in\r\n the mode of hiring.\r\n\r\n 2. An increase of the hands.\r\n\r\n 3. A decrease of the work, either in particular places, at particular\r\n times, or in the aggregate, owing to a decrease either in the demand\r\n or means of supply.\r\n\r\nAny one of these causes, it has been demonstrated, must necessarily\r\ntend to induce an over supply of labourers and consequently a casualty\r\nof labour, for it has been pointed out that an over supply of labourers\r\ndoes not depend _solely_ on an increase of the workers beyond the means\r\nof working, but that a decrease of the ordinary quantity of work, or a\r\ngeneral increase of the hours or rate of working, or an extension of\r\nthe system of production, or even a diminution of the term of hiring,\r\nwill also be attended with the same result--facts which should be borne\r\nsteadily in mind by all those who would understand the difficulties of\r\nthe times, and which the “economists” invariably ignore.\r\n\r\nOn a careful revision of the whole of the circumstances before\r\ndetailed, I am led to believe that there is considerable truth in\r\nthe statement lately put forward by the working classes, that only\r\none-third of the operatives of this country are fully employed, while\r\nanother third are partially employed, and the remaining third wholly\r\nunemployed; that is to say, estimating the working classes as being\r\nbetween four and five millions in number, I think we may safely\r\nassert--considering how many depend for their employment on particular\r\ntimes, seasons, fashions, and accidents, and the vast quantity of\r\nover-work and scamp-work in nearly all the cheap trades of the present\r\nday, the number of women and children who are being continually\r\ndrafted into the different handicrafts with the view of reducing the\r\nearnings of the men, the displacement of human labour in some cases by\r\nmachinery, and the tendency to increase the division of labour, and to\r\nextend the large system of production beyond the requirements of the\r\nmarkets, as well as the temporary mode of hiring--all these things\r\nbeing considered, I say I believe we may safely conclude that, out of\r\nthe four million five hundred thousand people who have to depend on\r\ntheir industry for the livelihood of themselves and families, there is\r\n(owing to the extraordinary means of economizing labour which have been\r\ndeveloped of late years, and the discovery as to how to do the work of\r\nthe nation with fewer people) barely sufficient work for the _regular_\r\nemployment of half of our labourers, so that only 1,500,000 are fully\r\nand constantly employed, while 1,500,000 more are employed only half\r\ntheir time, and the remaining 1,500,000 wholly unemployed, obtaining a\r\nday’s work _occasionally_ by the displacement of some of the others.\r\n\r\nAdopt what explanation we will of this appalling deficiency of\r\nemployment, one thing at least is certain: we cannot _consistently with\r\nthe facts of the country_, ascribe it to an increase of the population\r\nbeyond the means of labour; for we have seen that, while the people\r\nhave increased during the last fifty years at the rate of ·9 per cent.\r\nper annum, the wealth and productions of the kingdom have far exceeded\r\nthat amount.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CASUAL LABOURERS AMONG THE RUBBISH-CARTERS.\r\n\r\nThe casual labour of so large a body of men as the rubbish-carters is a\r\nquestion of high importance, for it affects the whole unskilled labour\r\nmarket. And this is one of the circumstances distinguishing unskilled\r\nfrom skilled labour. Unemployed cabinet-makers, for instance, do not\r\napply for work to a tailor; so that, with skilled labourers, only one\r\ntrade is affected in the slack season by the scarcity of employment\r\namong its operatives. With unskilled labourers it is otherwise. If in\r\nthe course of next week 100 rubbish-carters were from any cause to be\r\nthrown out of employment, and found an impossibility to obtain work at\r\nrubbish-carting, there would be 100 fresh applicants for employment\r\namong the bricklayer’s-labourers, scavagers, nightmen, sewermen,\r\ndock-workers, lumpers, &c. Many of the 100 thus unemployed would, of\r\ncourse, be willing to work at reduced wages merely that they might\r\nsubsist; and thus the hands employed by the regular and “honourable”\r\npart of those trades are exposed to the risk of being underworked,\r\nas regards wages, from the surplusage of labour in other unskilled\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nThe employment of the rubbish-carters depends, in the first\r\ninstance, upon the _season_. The services of the men are called into\r\nrequisition when houses are being built or removed. In the one case,\r\nthe rubbish-carters cart away the refuse earth; in the other they\r\nremove the old materials. The _brisk season_ for the builders, and\r\nconsequently for the rubbish-carters, is, as I heard several of them\r\nexpress it, “when days are long.” From about the middle of April to the\r\nmiddle of October is the _brisk_ season of the rubbish-carters, for\r\nduring those six months more buildings are erected than in the winter\r\nhalf of the year. There is an advantage in fine weather in the masonry\r\nbecoming _set_; and efforts are generally made to complete at least the\r\ncarcase of a house before the end of October, at the latest.\r\n\r\nI am informed that the difference in the employment of labourers\r\nabout buildings is 30 per cent.--one builder estimated it at 50 per\r\ncent.--less in winter than in summer, from the circumstance of fewer\r\nbuildings being then in the course of erection. It may be thought\r\nthat, as rubbish-carters are employed frequently on the foundation of\r\nbuildings, their business would not be greatly affected by the season\r\nor the weather. But the work is often more difficult in wet weather,\r\nthe ground being heavier, so that a smaller extent of work only can\r\nbe accomplished, compared to what can be done in fine weather; and an\r\nemployer may decline to pay six days’ wages for work in winter, which\r\nhe might get done in five days in summer. If the men work by the piece\r\nor the load the result is the same; the rubbish-carter’s employer has a\r\nsmaller return, for there is less work to be charged to the customer,\r\nwhile the cost in keeping the horses is the same.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that under the most favourable circumstances about\r\n_one-fourth_ of the rubbish-carters, even in the honourable trade, may\r\nbe exposed to the evils of non-employment merely from the state of the\r\nweather influencing, more or less, the custom of the trade, and this\r\neven during _the_ six months’ employment out of the year; after which\r\nthe men must find some other means of earning a livelihood.\r\n\r\nThere are, in round numbers, 850 operative rubbish-carters employed\r\nin the brisk season throughout the metropolis; hence 212 men, at this\r\ncalculation, would be regularly deprived of work every year for six\r\nmonths out of the twelve. It will be seen, however, on reference to\r\nthe table here given, that the average number of weeks each of the\r\nrubbish-carters is employed throughout the twelve months is far below\r\n26; indeed many have but three and four weeks work out of the 52.\r\n\r\nBy an analysis of the returns I have collected on this subject I find\r\nthe following to have been the actual term of employment for the\r\nseveral rubbish-carters in the course of last year:--\r\n\r\n               Employment in the\r\n   Men.              Year.\r\n\r\n    9 had        39 weeks, or    9 months.\r\n  214  „         26   „          6   „\r\n    4  „         20   „          5   „\r\n   10  „         18   „\r\n   28  „         16   „          4   „\r\n    8  „         14   „\r\n  353  „         13   „          3   „\r\n    4  „         12   „\r\n   34  „         10   „\r\n   29  „          9   „\r\n   38  „          8   „          2   „\r\n   38  „          6   „\r\n   27  „          5   „\r\n   45  „          4   „          1   „\r\n   15  „          3   „\r\n  ---\r\n  856\r\n\r\nHence about one-fourth of the trade appear to have been employed for\r\nsix months, while upwards of one-half had work for only three months\r\nor less throughout the year--many being at work only three days in the\r\nweek during that time.\r\n\r\nThe rubbish-carter is exposed to another casualty over which he can no\r\nmore exercise control than he can over the weather; I mean to what is\r\ngenerally called _speculation_, or a rage for building. This is evoked\r\nby the state of the money market, and other causes upon which I need\r\nnot dilate; but the effect of it upon the labourers I am describing is\r\nthis: capitalists may in one year embark sufficient means in building\r\nspeculations to erect, say 500 new houses, in any particular district.\r\nIn the following year they may not erect more than 200 (if any), and\r\nthus, as there is the same extent of unskilled labour in the market,\r\nthe number of hands required is, if the trade be generally less\r\nspeculative, less in one year than in its predecessor by the number of\r\nrubbish-carters required to work at the foundations of 300 houses. Such\r\na cause may be exceptional; but during the last ten years the inhabited\r\nhouses in the five districts of the Registrar-General have increased\r\nto the extent of 45,000, or from 262,737 in 1841, to 307,722 in 1851.\r\nIt appears, then, that the annual increase of our metropolitan houses,\r\nconcluding that they increase in a regular yearly ratio, is 4500. Last\r\nyear, however, as I am informed by an experienced builder, there were\r\nrather fewer buildings erected (he spoke only from his own observations\r\nand personal knowledge of the business) than the yearly average of the\r\ndecennial term.\r\n\r\nThe casual and constant wages of the rubbish-carters may be thus\r\ndetailed. The whole system of the labour, I may again state, must be\r\nregarded as _casual_, or--as the word imports in its derivation from\r\nthe Latin _casus_, a chance--the labour of men who are occasionally\r\nemployed. Some of the most respectable and industrious rubbish-carters\r\nwith whom I met, told me they generally might make up their minds,\r\nthough they might have excellent masters, to be six months of the year\r\nunemployed at rubbish-carting; this, too, is less than the average of\r\nthis chance employment.\r\n\r\nCalculating, then, the rubbish-carter’s receipt of _nominal wages_ at\r\n18_s._, and his _actual wages_ at 20_s._ in the honourable trade, I\r\nfind the following amount to be paid.\r\n\r\nBy nominal wages, I have before explained, I mean what a man is _said_\r\nto receive, or has been _promised_ that he shall be paid weekly. Actual\r\nwages, on the other hand, are what a man positively _receives_, there\r\nbeing sometimes additions in the form of perquisites or allowances;\r\nsometimes deductions in the way of fines and stoppages; the additions\r\nin the rubbish-carting trade appear to average about 2_s._ a week.\r\nBut these _actual wages_ are received only so long as the men are\r\nemployed, that is to say, they are the _casual_ rather than the\r\n_constant_ earnings of the men working at a trade, which is essentially\r\nof an occasional or temporary character; the average employment at\r\nrubbish-carting being only three months in the year.\r\n\r\nLet us see, therefore, what would be the constant earnings or income of\r\nthe men working at the better-paid portion of the trade.\r\n\r\n                                                 £  _s._ _d._\r\n  The gross actual wages of ten\r\n  rubbish-carters, casually employed\r\n  for 39 weeks, at 20_s._ per week,\r\n  amount to                                       390  0    0\r\n\r\n  The gross actual wages of 250\r\n  rubbish-carters, casually employed\r\n  for 26 weeks, at 20_s._ per week               6500  0    0\r\n\r\n  The gross actual wages of 360\r\n  rubbish-carters, casually employed\r\n  for 13 weeks, at 20_s._ per week               4600  0    0\r\n                                                 ------------\r\n  Total gross actual wages of 620\r\n  of the better-paid rubbish-carters           11,490  0    0\r\n\r\nBut this, as I said before, represents only the _casual_ wages of the\r\nbetter-paid operatives--that is to say, it shows the amount of money\r\nor money’s worth that is positively received by the men while they are\r\nin employment. To understand what are the _constant_ wages of these\r\nmen, we must divide their gross casual earnings by 52, the number of\r\nweeks in the year: thus we find that the constant wages of the ten\r\nmen who were employed for 39 weeks, were 15_s._ instead of 20_s._ per\r\nweek--that is to say, their wages, equally divided throughout the year,\r\nwould have yielded that constant weekly income. By the same reasoning,\r\nthe 20_s._ per week casual wages of the 250 men employed for 26 weeks\r\nout of the 52, were equal to only 10_s._ constant weekly wages; and so\r\nthe 360 men, who had 20_s._ per week casually for only three months\r\nin the year, had but 5_s._ a week _constantly_ throughout the whole\r\nyear. Hence we see the enormous difference there may be between a man’s\r\ncasual and his constant earnings at a given trade.\r\n\r\nThe next question that forces itself on the mind is, how do the\r\nrubbish-carters live when no longer employed at this kind of work?\r\n\r\nWhen the slack season among rubbish-carters commences, nearly one-fifth\r\nof the operatives are discharged. These take to scavaging or dustman’s\r\nwork, as well as that of navigators, or, indeed, any form of unskilled\r\nlabour, some obtaining full employ, but the greater part being able\r\nto “get a job only now and then.” Those masters who keep their men\r\non throughout the year are some of them large dust contractors, some\r\ncarmen, some dairymen, and (in one or two instances in the suburbs, as\r\nat Hackney) small farmers. The dust-contractors and carmen, who are by\r\nfar the more numerous, find employment for the men employed by them\r\nas rubbish-carters in the season, either at the dust-yard or carrying\r\nsand, or, indeed, carting any materials they may have to move--the\r\nwages to the men remaining the same; indeed such is the transient\r\ncharacter of the rubbish-carting trade, that there are no masters or\r\noperatives who devote themselves solely to the business.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF CASUAL LABOUR IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\nHaving now pointed out the causes of casual labour, I proceed to set\r\nforth its effects.\r\n\r\nAll casual labour, as I have said, is necessarily _uncertain_\r\nlabour; and wherever uncertainty exists, there can be no foresight\r\nor pro-vidence. Had the succession of events in nature been\r\nirregular,--had it been ordained by the Creator that similar causes\r\nunder similar circumstances should _not_ be attended with similar\r\neffects,--it would have been impossible for us to have had any\r\nknowledge of the future, or to have made any preparations concerning\r\nit. Had the seasons followed each other fitfully,--had the sequences\r\nin the external world been variable instead of invariable, and what\r\nare now termed “constants” from the regularity of their succession\r\nbeen changed into inconstants,--what provision could even the most\r\nprudent of us have made? Where all was dark and unstable, we could\r\nonly have guessed instead of reasoned as to what was to come; and who\r\nwould have deprived himself of present enjoyments to avoid future\r\nprivations, which could appear neither probable nor even possible\r\nto him? Pro-vidence, therefore, is simply the result of certainty,\r\nand whatever tends to increase our faith in the uniform sequences\r\nof outward events, as well as our reliance on the means we have of\r\navoiding the evils connected with them, necessarily tends to make us\r\nmore prudent. Where the means of sustenance and comfort are fixed, the\r\nhuman being becomes conscious of what he has to depend upon; and if he\r\nfeel _assured_ that such means may fail him in old age or in sickness,\r\nand be fully impressed with the _certainty_ of suffering from either,\r\nhe will immediately proceed to make some provision against the time of\r\nadversity or infirmity. If, however, his means be _uncertain_--abundant\r\nat one time, and deficient at another--a spirit of speculation or\r\ngambling with the future will be induced, and the individual get to\r\nbelieve in “luck” and “fate” as the arbiters of his happiness rather\r\nthan to look upon himself as “the architect of his fortunes”--trusting\r\nto “chance” rather than his own powers and foresight to relieve him\r\nat the hour of necessity. The same result will necessarily ensue if,\r\nfrom defective reasoning powers, the ordinary course of nature be not\r\nsufficiently apparent to him, or if, being in good health, he grow too\r\nconfident upon its continuance, and, either from this or other causes,\r\nis led to believe that death will overtake him before his powers of\r\nself-support decay.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary effects of uncertain labour, then, are to drive the\r\nlabourers to improvidence, recklessness, and pauperism.\r\n\r\nEven in the classes which we do not rank among labourers, as, for\r\ninstance, authors, artists, musicians, actors, uncertainty or\r\nirregularity of employment and remuneration produces a spirit of\r\nwastefulness and carelessness. The steady and daily accruing gains of\r\ntrade and of some of the professions form a certain and staple income;\r\nwhile in other professions, where a large sum may be realized at one\r\ntime, and then no money be earned until after an interval, incomings\r\nare rapidly spent, and the interval is one of suffering. This is part\r\nof the very nature, the very essence, of the casualty of employment\r\nand the delay of remuneration. The past privation gives a zest to\r\nthe present enjoyment; while the present enjoyment renders the past\r\nprivation faint as a remembrance and unimpressive as a warning. “Want\r\nof providence,” writes Mr. Porter, “on the part of those who live by\r\nthe labour of their hands, and whose employments so often depend upon\r\ncircumstances beyond their control, is a theme which is constantly\r\nbrought forward by many whose lot in life has been cast beyond the\r\nreach of want. It is, indeed, greatly to be wished, for their own\r\nsakes, that the habit were general among the labouring classes of\r\nsaving some part of their wages when fully employed, against less\r\nprosperous times; but it is difficult for those who are placed in\r\ncircumstances of ease to _estimate the amount of virtue that is implied\r\nin this self-denial_. It must be a hard trial for one who has recently,\r\nperhaps, seen his family enduring want, to deny them the small amount\r\nof indulgences, which are, at the best of times, placed within their\r\nreach.”\r\n\r\nIt is easy enough for men in smooth circumstances to say, “the\r\nprivation is a man’s own fault, since, to avoid it, he has but to\r\napportion the sum he may receive in a lump over the interval of\r\nnon-recompense which he knows will follow.” Such a course as this,\r\nexperience and human nature have shown not to be easy--perhaps, with\r\na few exceptions, not to be possible. It is the starving and not the\r\nwell-fed man that is in danger of surfeiting himself. When pestilence\r\nor revolution are rendering life and property _casualties_ in a\r\ncountry, the same spirit of improvident recklessness breaks forth. In\r\nLondon, on the last visitation of the plague, in the reign of Charles\r\nII., a sort of Plague Club indulged in the wildest excesses in the\r\nvery heart of the pestilence. To these orgies no one was admitted who\r\nhad not been bereft of some relative by the pest. In Paris, during the\r\nreign of terror in the first revolution, the famous Guillotine Club\r\nwas composed of none but those who had lost some near relative by the\r\nguillotine. When they met for their half-frantic revels every one wore\r\nsome symbol of death: breast pins in the form of guillotines, rings\r\nwith death’s-heads, and such like. The duration of their own lives\r\nthese Guillotine Clubbists knew to be uncertain, not merely in the\r\nordinary uncertainty of nature, but from the character of the times;\r\nand this feeling of the jeopardy of existence, from the practice of\r\nviolence and bloodshed, wrought the effects I have described. Life\r\nwas more than naturally casual. When the famine was at the worst in\r\nIreland, it was remarked in the _Cork Examiner_, that in that city\r\nthere never had been seen more street “larking” or street gambling\r\namong the poor lads and young men who were really starving. This was a\r\nnatural result of the casualty of labour and the consequent casualty of\r\nfood. Persons, it should be remembered, do not insure houses or shops\r\nthat are “doubly or trebly hazardous;” they gamble on the uncertainty.\r\n\r\nMr. Porter, in his “Progress of the Nation,” cites a fact bearing\r\nimmediately upon the present subject.\r\n\r\n“The formation of a canal, which has been in progress during the last\r\nfive years, in the north of Ireland (this was written in 1847), has\r\nafforded steady employment to a portion of the peasantry, who before\r\nthat time were suffering all the evils, so common in that country,\r\nwhich result from the precariousness of employment. Such work as they\r\ncould previously get came at uncertain intervals, and was sought\r\nby so many competitors, that the remuneration was of the scantiest\r\namount. In this condition of things the men were improvident, to\r\nrecklessness; their wages, insufficient for the comfortable sustenance\r\nof their families, were wasted in procuring for themselves a temporary\r\nforgetfulness of their misery at the whiskey-shop, and the men\r\nappeared to be sunk into a state of hopeless degradation. From the\r\nmoment, however, that work was offered to them which was _constant in\r\nits nature and certain in its duration_, and on which their weekly\r\nearnings would be sufficient to provide for their comfortable support,\r\n_men who had been idle and dissolute were converted into sober\r\nhard-working labourers, and proved themselves kind and careful husbands\r\nand fathers_; and it is stated as a fact, that, notwithstanding the\r\ndistribution of several hundred pounds weekly in wages, the whole of\r\nwhich must be considered as so much additional money placed in their\r\nhands, the consumption of whiskey was absolutely and _permanently_\r\ndiminished in the district. During the comparatively short period in\r\nwhich the construction of this canal was in progress, some of the most\r\ncareful labourers--men who most probably before then never knew what it\r\nwas to possess five shillings at any one time--saved sufficient money\r\nto enable them to emigrate to Canada.”\r\n\r\nThere can hardly be a stronger illustration of the blessing of constant\r\nand the curse of casual labour. We have competence and frugality as the\r\nresults of one system; poverty and extravagance as the results of the\r\nother; and among the very same individuals.\r\n\r\nIn the evidence given by Mr. Galloway, the engineer, before a\r\nparliamentary committee, he remarks, that “when employers are competent\r\nto show their men that their business is _steady and certain_, and when\r\nmen find that they are likely to have _permanent_ employment, they have\r\nalways _better habits and more settled notions_, which will make them\r\n_better men_ and _better workmen_, and will produce great benefits to\r\nall who are interested in their employment.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, even if payment be assured to a working man regularly, _but\r\ndeferred for long intervals_, so as to make the returns lose all\r\nappearance of regularity, he will rarely be found able to resist the\r\ntemptation of a tavern, and, perhaps, a long-continued carouse, or of\r\nsome other extravagance to his taste, when he receives a month’s dues\r\nat once. I give an instance of this in the following statement:--\r\n\r\nFor some years after the peace of 1815 the staffs of the militias were\r\nkept up, but not in any active service. During the war the militias\r\nperformed what are now the functions of the regular troops in the three\r\nkingdoms, their stations being changed more frequently than those of\r\nany of the regular regiments at the present day. Indeed, they only\r\ndiffered from the “regulars” in name. There was the same military\r\ndiscipline, and the sole difference was, that the militia-men--who\r\nwere balloted for periodically--could not, by the laws regulating\r\ntheir embodiment, be sent out of the United Kingdom for purposes of\r\nwarfare. The militias were embodied for twenty-eight days’ training,\r\nonce in four years (seldom less) after the peace, and the staff acted\r\nas the drill sergeants. They were usually steady, orderly men, working\r\nat their respective crafts when not on duty after the militia’s\r\ndisembodiment, and some who had not been brought up to any handicraft\r\nturned out--perhaps from their military habits of early rising and\r\norderliness--very good gardeners, both on their own account and as\r\nassistants in gentlemen’s grounds. No few of them saved money. Yet\r\nthese men, with very few exceptions, when they received a month’s pay,\r\nfooled away a part of it in tippling and idleness, to which they were\r\nnot at all addicted when attending regularly to their work with its\r\nregular returns. If they got into any trouble in consequence of their\r\ncarousing, it was looked upon as a sort of legitimate excuse, “Why you\r\nsee, sir, it was the 24th” (the 24th of each month being the pension\r\nday).\r\n\r\nThe thoughtless extravagance of sailors when, on their return to port,\r\nthey receive in one sum the wages they have earned by severe toil\r\namidst storms and dangers during a long voyage, I need not speak of; it\r\nis a thing well known.\r\n\r\nThese soldiers and seamen cannot be said to have been _casually_\r\nemployed, but the results were the same as if they had been so\r\nemployed; the money came to them in a lump at so long an interval as to\r\nappear uncertain, and was consequently squandered.\r\n\r\nI may cite the following example as to the effects of uncertain\r\nearnings upon the household outlay of labourers who suffer from the\r\ncasualties of employment induced by the season of the year. “In the\r\nlong fine days of summer, the little daughter of a working brickmaker,”\r\nI was told, “used to order chops and other choice dainties of a\r\nbutcher, saying, ‘Please, sir, father don’t care for the price just\r\na-now; but he must have his chops good; line-chops, sir, and tender,\r\nplease--’cause he’s a brickmaker.’ In the winter, it was, ‘O please,\r\nsir, here’s a fourpenny bit, and you must send father something cheap.\r\nHe don’t care what it is, so long as it’s cheap. It’s winter, and he\r\nhasn’t no work, sir--’cause he’s a brickmaker.’”\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the tendency of casual labour to induce intemperate\r\nhabits. In confirmation of this I am enabled to give the following\r\naccount as to the increase of the sale of malt liquor in the metropolis\r\n_consequent upon wet weather_. The account is derived from the personal\r\nobservations of a gentleman long familiar with the brewing trade, in\r\nconnection with one of the largest houses. In short, I may state that\r\nthe account is given on the very best authority.\r\n\r\nThere are _nine_ large brewers in London; of these the two firms\r\ntransacting the greatest extent of business supply, daily, 1000 barrels\r\neach firm to their customers; the seven others, among them, dispose,\r\naltogether, of 3000 barrels daily. All these 5000 barrels a day are\r\nsolely for town consumption; and this may be said to be the _average_\r\nsupply the year through, but the public-house sale is far from regular.\r\n\r\nAfter a wet day the sale of malt liquor, principally beer (porter), to\r\nthe metropolitan retailers is from 500 to 1000 barrels more than when\r\na wet day has not occurred; that is to say, the supply increases from\r\n5000 barrels to 5500 and 6000. Such of the publicans as keep small\r\nstocks go the next day to their brewers to order a further supply;\r\nthose who have better-furnished cellars may not go for two or three\r\ndays after, but the result is the same.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this increased consumption is obvious; when the weather\r\nprevents workmen from prosecuting their respective callings in the\r\nopen air, they have recourse to drinking, to pass away the idle time.\r\nAny one who has made himself familiar with the habits of the working\r\nclasses has often found them crowding a public-house during a hard\r\nrain, especially in the neighbourhood of new buildings, or any public\r\nopen-air work. The street-sellers, themselves prevented from plying\r\ntheir trades outside, are busy in such times in the “publics,” offering\r\nfor sale braces, belts, hose, tobacco-boxes, nuts of different kinds,\r\napples, &c. A bargain may then be struck for so much and a half-pint of\r\nbeer, and so the consumption is augmented by the trade in other matters.\r\n\r\nNow, taking 750 barrels as the average of the extra sale of beer in\r\nconsequence of wet weather, we have a consumption beyond the demands\r\nof the ordinary trade in malt liquor of 27,000 gallons, or 216,000\r\npints. This, at 2_d._ a pint, is 3000_l._ for a day’s needless, and\r\noften prejudicial, outlay caused by the casualty of the weather and\r\nthe consequent casualty of labour. A censor of morals might say that\r\nthese men should go home under such circumstances; but their homes may\r\nbe at a distance, and may present no great attractions; the single men\r\namong them may have no homes, merely sleeping-places; and even the more\r\nprudent may think it advisable to wait awhile under shelter in hopes\r\nof the weather improving, so that they could resume their labour, and\r\nonly an hour or so be deducted from their wages. Besides, there is the\r\nattraction to the labourer of the warmth, discussion, freedom, and\r\nexcitement of the public-house.\r\n\r\nThat the great bulk of the consumers of this _additional_ beer are\r\nof the classes I have mentioned is, I think, plain enough, from the\r\nincrease being experienced only in that beverage, the consumption of\r\ngin being little affected by the same means. Indeed, the statistics\r\nshowing the ratio of beer and gin-drinking are curious enough (were\r\nthis the place to enter into them), the most gin, as a general rule,\r\nbeing consumed in the most depressed years.\r\n\r\n“It is a fact worth notice,” said a statistical journal, entitled\r\n“Facts and Figures,” published in 1841, “as illustrative of the\r\n_tendency of the times of pressure to increase spirit drinking_, that\r\nwhilst under the privations of last year (1840) the poorer classes\r\npaid 2,628,286_l._ tax for spirits; in 1836, a year of the greatest\r\nprosperity, the tax on British spirits amounted only to 2,390,188_l._\r\n_So true is it that to impoverish is to demoralise._”\r\n\r\nThe numbers who imbibe, in the course of a wet day, these 750 barrels,\r\ncannot, of course, be ascertained, but the following calculations may\r\nbe presented. The class of men I have described rarely have spare\r\nmoney, but if known to a landlord, they probably may obtain credit\r\nuntil the Saturday night. Now, putting their _extra_ beer-drinking on\r\nwet days--for on fine days there is generally a pint or more consumed\r\ndaily per working man--putting, I say, the _extra_ potations at a pot\r\n(quart) each man, we find _one hundred and eight thousand_ consumers\r\n(out of 2,000,000 people, or, discarding the women and children, not\r\n1,000,000)! A number doubling, and trebling, and quadrupling the male\r\nadult population of many a splendid continental city.\r\n\r\nOf the data I have given, I may repeat, no doubt can be entertained;\r\nnor, as it seems to me, can any doubt be entertained that the increased\r\nconsumption is directly attributable to the casualty of labour[55].\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SCURF TRADE AMONG THE RUBBISH-CARTERS.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to treat of the cheap or “scurf” labourers among\r\nthe rubbish-carters, I shall do as I have done in connection with\r\nthe casual labourers of the same trade, say a few words on that kind\r\nof labour in general, both as to the means by which it is usually\r\nobtained and as to the distinctive qualities of the scurf or low-priced\r\nlabourers; for experience teaches me that the mode by which labour is\r\ncheapened is more or less similar in all trades, and it will therefore\r\nsave much time and space if I here--as with the casual labourers--give\r\nthe general facts in connection with this part of my subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, there are but two direct modes of cheapening\r\nlabour, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. By making the workmen do _more_ work for the _same_ pay.\r\n\r\n2. By making them do the _same_ work for _less_ pay.\r\n\r\nThe first of these modes is what is technically termed “_driving_,”\r\nespecially when effected by compulsory “overwork;” and it is called\r\nthe “economy of labour” when brought about by more elaborate and\r\nrefined processes, such as the division of labour, the large system\r\nof production, the invention of machinery, and the _temporary_, as\r\ncontradistinguished from the _permanent_, mode of hiring.\r\n\r\nEach of these modes of making workmen do _more_ work for the _same_\r\npay, can but have the same depressing effect on the labour market, for\r\nnot only is the _rate_ of remuneration (or ratio of the work to the\r\npay) reduced when the operative is made to do a greater quantity of\r\nwork for the same amount of money, but, unless the means of disposing\r\nof the extra products be proportionately increased, it is evident that\r\njust as many workmen must be displaced thereby as the increased term or\r\nrate of working exceeds the extension of the markets; that is to say,\r\nif 4000 workpeople be made to produce each twice as much as formerly\r\n(either by extending the hours of labour or increasing their rate of\r\nlabouring), then if the markets or means of disposing of the extra\r\nproducts be increased only one-half, 1000 hands must, according to\r\nCocker, be deprived of their ordinary employment; and these competing\r\nwith those who are in work will immediately tend to reduce the wages\r\nof the trade generally, so that not only will the _rate_ of wages\r\nbe decreased, since each will have more work to do, but the actual\r\nearnings of the workmen will be diminished likewise.\r\n\r\nOf the economy of labour itself, as a means of cheapening work,\r\nthere is no necessity for me to speak here. It is, indeed, generally\r\nadmitted, that to economize labour without proportionally extending\r\nthe markets for the products of such labour, is to deprive a certain\r\nnumber of workmen of their ordinary means of living; and under the head\r\nof casual labour so many instances have been given of this principle\r\nthat it would be wearisome to the reader were I to do other than allude\r\nto the matter at present. There are, however, several other means of\r\ncausing a workman to do more than his ordinary quantity of work. These\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n 1. By extra supervision when the workmen are paid by the day. Of this\r\n mode of increased production an instance has already been cited in the\r\n account of the strapping-shops given at p. 304, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n 2. By increasing the workman’s interest in his work; as in piece-work,\r\n where the payment of the operative is made proportional to the\r\n quantity of work done by him. Of this mode examples have already been\r\n given at p. 303, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n 3. By large quantities of work given out at one time; as in\r\n “lump-work” and “contract work.”\r\n\r\n 4. By the domestic system of work, or giving out materials to be made\r\n up at the homes of the workpeople.\r\n\r\n 5. By the middleman system of labour.\r\n\r\n 6. By the prevalence of small masters.\r\n\r\n 7. By a reduced rate of pay, as forcing operatives to labour both\r\n longer and quicker, in order to make up the same amount of income.\r\n\r\nOf several of these modes of work I have already spoken, citing\r\nfacts as to their pernicious influence upon the greater portion of\r\nthose trades where they are found to prevail. I have already shown\r\nhow, by extra supervision--by increased interest in the work--as\r\nwell as by decreased pay, operatives can be made to do more work\r\nthan they otherwise would, and so be the cause, unless the market be\r\nproportionately extended, of depriving some of their fellow-labourers\r\nof their fair share of employment. It now only remains for me to set\r\nforth the effect of those modes of employment which have not yet been\r\ndescribed, viz., the domestic system, the middleman system, and the\r\ncontract and lump system, as well as the small-master system of work.\r\n\r\nLet me begin with the first of the last-mentioned modes of cheapening\r\nlabour, viz., _the domestic system of work_.\r\n\r\nI find, by investigation, that in trades where the system of working on\r\nthe master’s premises has been departed from, and a man is allowed to\r\ntake his work home, there is invariably a tendency to cheapen labour.\r\nThese home workers, whenever opportunity offers, will use other men’s\r\nill-paid labour, or else employ the members of their family to enhance\r\ntheir own profits.\r\n\r\nThe domestic system, moreover, naturally induces _over-work and\r\nSunday-work, as well as tends to change journeymen into trading\r\noperatives, living on the labour of their fellow-workmen_. When the\r\nwork is executed off the master’s premises, of course there are\r\nneither definite hours nor days for labour; and the consequence is,\r\nthe generality of home workers labour early and late, Sundays as well\r\nas week-days, availing themselves at the same time of the co-operation\r\nof their wives and children; thus the trade becomes overstocked with\r\nworkpeople by the introduction of a vast number of new hands into\r\nit, as well as by the overwork of the men themselves who thus obtain\r\nemployment. When I was among the tailors, I received from a journeyman\r\nto whom I was referred by the Trades’ Society as the one best able to\r\nexplain the causes of the decline of that trade, the following lucid\r\naccount of the evils of this system of labour:--\r\n\r\n“The principal cause of the decline of our trade is the employment\r\ngiven to workmen at their own homes, or, in other words, to the\r\n‘sweaters.’ The sweater is the greatest evil in the trade; as the\r\nsweating system increases the number of hands to an almost incredible\r\nextent--wives, sons, daughters, and extra women, all working ‘long\r\ndays’--that is, labouring from sixteen to eighteen hours per day, and\r\nSundays as well. By this system two men obtain as much work as would\r\ngive employment to three or four men working regular hours in the shop.\r\nConsequently, the sweater being enabled to get the work done by women\r\nand children at a lower price than the regular workman, obtains the\r\ngreater part of the garments to be made, while men who depend upon\r\nthe shop for their living are obliged to walk about idle. A greater\r\nquantity of work is done under the sweating system at a lower price. I\r\nconsider that the decline of my trade dates from the change of day-work\r\ninto piece-work. According to the old system, the journeyman was paid\r\nby the day, and consequently must have done his work under the eye of\r\nhis employer. It is true that work was given out by the master before\r\nthe change from day-work to piece-work was regularly acknowledged in\r\nthe trade. But still it was morally impossible for work to be given\r\nout and not be paid by the piece. _Hence I date the decrease in the\r\nwages of the workman from the introduction of piece-work, and giving\r\nout garments to be made off the premises of the master._ The effect of\r\nthis was, that the workman making the garment, knowing that the master\r\ncould not tell whom he got to do his work for him, employed women\r\nand children to help him, and paid them little or nothing for their\r\nlabour. This was the beginning of the sweating system. The workmen\r\ngradually became transformed from journeymen into ‘middlemen,’ living\r\nby the labour of others. Employers soon began to find that they could\r\nget garments made at a less sum than the regular price, and those\r\ntradesmen who were anxious to force their trade, by underselling their\r\nmore honourable neighbours, readily availed themselves of this means of\r\nobtaining cheap labour.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _middleman system of work_ is so much akin to the domestic system,\r\nof which, indeed, it is but a necessary result, that it forms a natural\r\naddendum to the above. Of this indirect mode of employing workmen, I\r\nsaid, in the _Chronicle_, when treating of the timber-porters at the\r\ndocks:--\r\n\r\n“The middleman system is the one crying evil of the day. Whether\r\nhe goes by the name of ‘sweater,’ ‘chamber-master,’ ‘lumper,’ or\r\ncontractor, it is this _trading operative_ who is the great means of\r\nreducing the wages of his fellow working-men. To make a profit out of\r\nthe employment of his brother operatives he must, of course, obtain\r\na lower class and, consequently, cheaper labour. Hence it becomes a\r\n_business_ with him to hunt out the lowest grades of working men--that\r\nis to say, those who are either morally or intellectually inferior in\r\nthe craft--the drunken, the dishonest, the idle, the vagabond, and\r\nthe unskilful; these are the instruments that he seeks for, because,\r\nthese being unable to obtain employment at the regular wages of the\r\nsober, honest, industrious, and skilful portion of the trade, he can\r\nobtain their labour at a lower rate than what is usually paid. Hence\r\ndrunkards, tramps, men without character or station, apprentices,\r\nchildren--all suit him. Indeed, the more degraded the labourers, the\r\nbetter they answer his purpose, for the cheaper he can get their work,\r\nand consequently the more he can make out of it.\r\n\r\n“‘Boy labour or thief labour,’ said a middleman, on a large scale,\r\nto me, ‘what do I care, so long as I can get my work done cheap?’\r\nThat this _seeking out_ of cheap and inferior labour really takes\r\nplace, and is a necessary consequence of the middleman system, we have\r\nmerely to look into the condition of any trade where it is extensively\r\npursued. I have shown, in my account of the tailors’ trade printed in\r\nthe _Chronicle_, that the wives of the sweaters not only parade the\r\nstreets of London on the look-out for youths raw from the country, but\r\nthat they make periodical trips to the poorest provinces of Ireland,\r\nin order to obtain workmen at the lowest possible rate. I have shown,\r\nmoreover, that foreigners are annually imported from the Continent\r\nfor the same purpose, and that among the chamber-masters in the shoe\r\ntrade, the child-market at Bethnal-green, as well as the workhouses,\r\nare continually ransacked for the means of obtaining a cheaper kind of\r\nlabour. All my investigations go to prove, that it is chiefly by means\r\nof this middleman system that the wages of the working men are reduced.\r\nIt is this contractor--this trading operative--who is invariably the\r\nprime mover in the reduction of the wages of his fellow-workmen. He\r\nuses the most degraded of the class as a means of underselling the\r\nworthy and skilful labourers, and of ultimately dragging the better\r\ndown to the abasement of the worst. He cares not whether the trade to\r\nwhich he belongs is already overstocked with hands, for, be those hands\r\nas many as they may, and the ordinary wages of his craft down to bare\r\nsubsistence point, it matters not a jot to him; _he_ can live solely by\r\nreducing them still lower, and so he immediately sets about drafting\r\nor importing a fresh and cheaper stock into the trade. If _men_ cannot\r\nsubsist on lower prices, then he takes apprentices, or hires children;\r\nif women of chastity cannot afford to labour at the price he gives,\r\nthen he has recourse to prostitutes; or if workmen of character and\r\nworth refuse to work at less than the ordinary rate, then he seeks out\r\nthe moral refuse of the trade--those whom none else will employ; or\r\nelse he flies, to find labour meet for his purpose, to the workhouse\r\nand the gaol. Backed by this cheap and refuse labour, he offers his\r\nwork at lower prices, and so keeps on reducing and reducing the wages\r\nof his brethren, until all sink in poverty, wretchedness, and vice. Go\r\nwhere we will, look into whatever poorly-paid craft we please, we shall\r\nfind this _trading operative_, this _middleman_ or contractor, at the\r\nbottom of the degradation.”\r\n\r\nThe “contract system” or “lump work,” as it is called, is but a\r\ncorollary, as it were, of the foregoing; for it is an essential part of\r\nthe middleman system, that the work should be obtained by the trading\r\noperative in large quantities, so that those upon whose labour he\r\nlives should be kept continually occupied, and the more, of course,\r\nthat he can obtain work for, the greater his profit. When a quantity\r\nof work, usually paid for by the piece, is given out at one time, the\r\nnatural tendency is for the piece-work to pass into lump-work; that\r\nis to say, if there be in a trade a number of distinct parts, each\r\nrequiring, perhaps, from the division of labour, a distinct hand for\r\nthe execution of it, or if each of these parts bear a different price,\r\nit is frequently the case that the master will contract with some one\r\nworkman for the execution of the whole, agreeing to give a certain\r\nprice for the job “in the lump,” and allowing the workman to get whom\r\nhe pleases to execute it. This is the case with the piece-working\r\nmasters in the coach-building trade; but it is not essential to the\r\ncontract or lump system of work, that other hands should be employed;\r\nthe main distinction between it and piece-work being that the work is\r\ngiven out in large quantities, and a certain allowance or reduction of\r\nprice effected from that cause alone.\r\n\r\nIt is this contract or lump work which constitutes the great evil of\r\nthe carpenter’s, as well as of many other trades; and as in those\r\ncrafts, so in this, we find that the lower the wages are reduced the\r\ngreater becomes the number of trading operatives or middlemen. For it\r\nis when workmen find the difficulty of living by their labour increased\r\nthat they take to scheming and trading upon the labour of their\r\nfellows. In the slop trade, where the pay is the worst, these creatures\r\nabound the most; and so in the carpenter’s trade, where the wages are\r\nthe lowest--as among the speculative builders--there the system of\r\ncontracting and sub-contracting is found in full force.\r\n\r\nOf this contract or lump work, I received the following account from\r\nthe foreman to a large speculating builder, when I was inquiring into\r\nthe condition of the London carpenters:--\r\n\r\n“The way in which the work is done is mostly by letting and subletting.\r\nThe masters usually prefer to let work, because it takes all the\r\ntrouble off their hands. They know what they are to get for the job,\r\nand of course they let it as much under that figure as they possibly\r\ncan, all of which is clear gain without the least trouble. How the\r\nwork is done, or by whom, it’s no matter to them, so long as they can\r\nmake what they want out of the job, and have no bother about it. Some\r\nof our largest builders are taking to this plan, and a party who used\r\nto have one of the largest shops in London has within the last three\r\nyears discharged all the men in his employ (he had 200 at least),\r\nand has now merely an office, and none but clerks and accountants in\r\nhis pay. He has taken to letting his work out instead of doing it at\r\nhome. The parties to whom the work is let by the speculating builders\r\nare generally working men, and these men in their turn look out for\r\nother working men, who will take the job cheaper than they will; and\r\nso I leave you, sir, and the public to judge what the party who really\r\nexecutes the work gets for his labour, and what is the quality of work\r\nthat he is likely to put into it. The speculating builder generally\r\nemploys an overlooker to see that the work is done sufficiently well\r\nto pass the surveyor. That’s all he cares about. Whether it’s done by\r\nthieves, or drunkards, or boys, it’s no matter to him. The overlooker,\r\nof course, sees after the first party to whom the work is let, and this\r\nparty in his turn looks after the several hands that he has sublet it\r\nto. The first man who agrees to the job takes it in the lump, and he\r\nagain lets it to others in the piece. I have known instances of its\r\nhaving been let again a third time, but this is not usual. The party\r\nwho takes the job in the lump from the speculator usually employs a\r\nforeman, whose duty it is to give out the materials and to make working\r\ndrawings. The men to whom it is sublet only find labour, while the\r\n‘lumper,’ or first contractor, agrees for both labour and materials.\r\nIt is usual in contract work, for the first party who takes the job\r\nto be bound in a large sum for the due and faithful performance of\r\nhis contract. He then, in his turn, finds out a sub-contractor, who\r\nis mostly a small builder, who will also bind himself that the work\r\nshall be properly executed, and there the binding ceases--those parties\r\nto whom the job is afterwards let, or sublet, employing foremen or\r\noverlookers to see that their contract is carried out. The first\r\ncontractor has scarcely any trouble whatsoever; he merely engages a\r\ngentleman, who rides about in a gig, to see that what is done is likely\r\nto pass muster. The sub-contractor has a little more trouble; and so it\r\ngoes on as it gets down and down. Of course I need not tell you that\r\nthe first contractor, who does the _least_ of all, gets the _most_ of\r\nall; while the poor wretch of a working man, who positively executes\r\nthe job, is obliged to slave away every hour, night after night, to get\r\na bare living out of it; and this is the contract system.”\r\n\r\nA tradesman, or a speculator, will contract, for a certain sum, to\r\ncomplete the skeleton of a house, and render it fit for habitation.\r\nHe will sublet the flooring to some working joiner, who will, in very\r\nmany cases, take it on such terms as to allow himself, by working early\r\nand late, the regular journeymen’s wages of 30_s._ a week, or perhaps\r\nrather more. Now this sub-contractor cannot complete the work within\r\nthe requisite time by his own unaided industry, and he employs men to\r\nassist him, often subletting again, and such assistant men will earn\r\nperhaps but 4_s._ a day. It is the same with the doors, the staircases,\r\nthe balustrades, the window-frames, the room-skirtings, the closets; in\r\nshort, all parts of the building.\r\n\r\nThe subletting is accomplished without difficulty. Old men are\r\nsometimes employed in such work, and will be glad of any remuneration\r\nto escape the workhouse; while stronger workmen are usually sanguine\r\nthat by extra exertion, “though the figure is low, they may make a tidy\r\nthing out of it after all.” In this way labour is cheapened. “Lump”\r\nwork, “piece” work, work by “the job,” are all portions of the contract\r\nsystem. The principle is the same. “Here is this work to be done, what\r\nwill you undertake to do it for?”\r\n\r\nIn number after number of the _Builder_ will be found statements\r\nheaded “Blind Builders.” One firm, responding to an advertisement for\r\n“estimates” of the building of a church, sends in an offer to execute\r\nthe work in the best style for 5000_l._ Another firm may offer to do\r\nit for somewhere about 3000_l._ The first-mentioned firm would do the\r\nwork well, paying the “honourable” rate of wages. The under-working\r\nfirm _must_ resort to the scamping and subletting system I have\r\nalluded to. It appears that the building of churches and chapels, of\r\nall denominations, is one of the greatest encouragement to slop, or\r\nscamp, or under-paid work. The same system prevails in many trades with\r\nequally pernicious effects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“If you will allow me,” says a correspondent, “I would state that\r\nthere is one cause of hardship and suffering to the labouring\r\nor handicraftsman, which, to my mind, is far more productive of\r\ndistress and poor-grinding than any other, or than all other causes\r\nput together: I allude to the _contract_ system, and especially in\r\nreference to printing. Depend upon it, sir, the father of wickedness\r\nhimself could not devise a more malevolent or dishonest course than\r\nthat now very generally pursued by those who should be, of all others,\r\nthe friends of the poor and working man. The Government and the great\r\nWest-end clubs have reduced their transactions to such a low level\r\nin this respect that it seems to be the only question with them, Who\r\nwill work lowest or supply goods at the lowest figure? And this, too,\r\ntotally irrespective of the circumstance whether it may not reduce\r\nwages or bankrupt the contractor. No matter whether a party who has\r\nexecuted the work required for years be noted for paying a fair and\r\nremunerating price to his workmen or sub-tradesmen, and bears the\r\ncharacter of a responsible and trustworthy man--all this is as nothing;\r\nfor somebody, who may be, for aught that is cared, deficient in all\r\nthese points, will do what is needful at _so much_ less; and then,\r\nunless willing to reduce the wage of his workpeople, the long-employed\r\ntradesman has but the alternative of losing his business or cheating\r\nhis creditors. And then, to give a smack to the whole affair, the\r\n‘Stationery Office’ of the Government, or the committee of the club,\r\nwill congratulate themselves and their auditors on the fact that a\r\ndiminution in expenses has been effected; a result commemorated perhaps\r\nby an addition of salary to the officials in the former case, and of a\r\n‘cordial vote of thanks’ in the latter. I do not write ‘without book,’\r\nI can assure you, on these matters; for I have long and earnestly\r\nwatched the subject, and could fill many a page with the details.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the ruinous effects of the contract system in connection with the\r\narmy clothing, Mr. Pearse, the army clothier, gave the following\r\nevidence before the Select Committee on Army and Navy Appointments.\r\n\r\n“When the contract for soldier’s great coats was opened, Mr. Maberly\r\ntook it at the same price (13_s._) in December, 1808; this shows the\r\neffect of wild competition. In February following, Esdailes’ house,\r\nwho were accoutrement makers, and not clothiers, got knowledge of\r\nwhat was Mr. Maberly’s price, and _they_ tendered at 12_s._ 6-1/2_d._\r\na month afterwards; it was evidently then a struggle for the price,\r\nand how the quality the least good (if we may use such a term) could\r\npass. Mr. Maberly did not like to be outbidden by Esdailes; _Esdailes\r\nstopped subsequently_, and Mr. Maberly bid 12_s._ 6_d._ three months\r\nafter, and Mr. Dixon bid again, and got the contract for 11_s._ 3_d._\r\nin October, and in December of that year another public tender took\r\nplace, and Messrs. A. and D. Cock took it at 11_s._ 5-1/2_d._, _and\r\nthey subsequently broke_. It went on in this sort of way,--changing\r\nhands every two or every three months, by bidding against each other.\r\nPresently, though it was calculated that the great coat was to wear\r\nfour years, it was found that _those great coats were so inferior\r\nin quality, that they wore only two years_, and representations were\r\naccordingly made to the Commander-in-Chief, when it was found necessary\r\nthat great care should be taken to go back to the original good quality\r\nthat had been established by the Duke of York.”\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw, another army clothier, and a gentleman with whose friendship,\r\nI am proud to say, I have been honoured since the commencement of\r\nmy inquiries--a gentleman actuated by the most kindly and Christian\r\nimpulses, and of whom the workpeople speak in terms of the highest\r\nadmiration and regard; this gentleman, impressed with a deep sense of\r\nthe evils of the contract system to the under-paid and over-worked\r\noperatives of his trade, addressed a letter to the Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Army, Navy, and Ordnance Estimates, from which the\r\nfollowing are extracts:--\r\n\r\n“My Lord, my object more particularly is, to request your lordship will\r\nsubmit to the committee, _as an evidence of the evils of contracts_,\r\nthe great coat sent herewith, made similar to those supplied to the\r\narmy, and I would respectfully appeal to them as men, gentlemen, _as\r\nChristians_, whether _fivepence_, the price now being given to poor\r\nfemales for making up those coats, is a fair and just price for six,\r\nseven, and eight hours’ work.... My Lord, _the misery amongst the\r\nworkpeople is most distressing_--of a mass of people, _willing to\r\nwork_, who cannot obtain it, and of a mass, especially women, most\r\niniquitously paid for their labour, who are in a state of oppression\r\ndisgraceful to the Legislature, the Government, the Church, and the\r\nconsuming public.... I would, therefore, most humbly and earnestly\r\ncall upon your lordship, and the other members of the committee, to\r\nrecommend an _immediate stop to be put to the system of contracting_\r\nnow pursued by the different government departments, as being one of\r\nfalse economy, as a system most _oppressive to the poor_, and _being\r\nmost injurious_, in every way, to the best _interests of the country_.”\r\n\r\nIn another place the same excellent gentleman says:--\r\n\r\n“I could refer to the screwing down of other things by the government\r\nauthorities, but the above will be sufficient to show _how cruelly the\r\nworkpeople employed in making up this clothing are oppressed; and some\r\nof the men will tell you they are tired of life. Last week I found one\r\nman making a country police coat, who said his wife and child were out\r\nbegging_.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last mentioned of the several modes of cheapening labour is the\r\n“_small-master system_” of work, that is to say, the operatives taking\r\nto make up materials on their own account rather than for capitalist\r\nemployers. In every trade where there are _small_ masters, trades into\r\nwhich it requires but little capital to embark, there is certain to be\r\na cheapening of labour. Such a man works himself, and to get work, to\r\nmeet the exigences of the rent and the demands of the collectors of the\r\nparliamentary and parochial taxes, he will often underwork the very\r\njourneymen whom he occasionally employs, doing “the job” in such cases\r\nwith the assistance of his family and apprentices, at a less rate of\r\nprofit than the amount of journeymen’s wages.\r\n\r\nConcerning these garret masters I said, when treating of the Cabinet\r\ntrade, in the _Chronicle_, “The cause of the extraordinary decline of\r\nwages in the Cabinet trade (even though the hands decreased and the\r\nwork increased to an unprecedented extent) will be found to consist\r\nin the increase that has taken place within the last 20 years of what\r\nare called ‘garret masters’ in the cabinet trade. These garret masters\r\nare a class of small ‘trade-working masters,’ the same as the ‘chamber\r\nmasters’ in the shoe trade, supplying both capital and labour. They are\r\nin manufacture what ‘the peasant proprietors’ are in agriculture--their\r\nown employers and their own workmen. There is, however, this one marked\r\ndistinction between the two classes--the garret master cannot, like\r\nthe peasant proprietor, _eat_ what he produces; the consequence is,\r\nthat he is obliged to convert each article into food immediately he\r\nmanufactures it--no matter what the state of the market may be. The\r\ncapital of the garret master being generally sufficient to find him in\r\nmaterials for the manufacture of only one article at a time, and his\r\nsavings being but barely enough for his subsistence while he is engaged\r\nin putting those materials together, he is compelled, the moment the\r\nwork is completed, to part with it for whatever he can get. He cannot\r\nafford to keep it even a day, for to do so is generally to remain a\r\nday unfed. Hence, if the market be at all slack, he has to force a\r\nsale by offering his goods at the lowest possible price. What wonder,\r\nthen, that the necessities of such a class of individuals should have\r\ncreated a special race of employers, known by the significant name of\r\n‘slaughter-house men’--or that these, being aware of the inability\r\nof the ‘garret masters’ to hold out against any offer, no matter how\r\nslight a remuneration it affords for their labour, should continually\r\nlower and lower their prices, until the entire body of the competitive\r\nportion of the cabinet trade is sunk in utter destitution and misery?\r\nMoreover, it is well known how strong is the stimulus among peasant\r\nproprietors, or, indeed, any class working for themselves, to extra\r\nproduction. So it is, indeed, with the garret masters; their industry\r\nis almost incessant, and hence a greater quantity of work is turned\r\nout by them, and continually forced into the market, than there would\r\notherwise be. What though there be a brisk and a slack season in the\r\ncabinet-maker’s trade as in the majority of others?--slack or brisk,\r\nthe garret masters must produce the same excessive quantity of goods.\r\nIn the hope of extricating himself from his overwhelming poverty, he\r\ntoils on, producing more and more--and yet the more he produces the\r\nmore hopeless does his position become; for the greater the stock that\r\nhe thrusts into the market, the lower does the price of his labour\r\nfall, until at last, he and his whole family work for less than half\r\nwhat he himself could earn a few years back by his own unaided labour.”\r\n\r\nThe small-master system of work leads, like the domestic system, with\r\nwhich, indeed, it is intimately connected, to the employment of\r\nwives, children, and apprentices, as a means of assistance and extra\r\nproduction--for as the prices decline so do the small masters strive by\r\nfurther labour to compensate for their loss of income.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the several modes of work by which labour is cheapened.\r\nThere are, as we have seen, but two ways of _directly_ effecting this,\r\nviz., first by making men do more work for the same pay, and secondly,\r\nby making them do the same work for less pay. The way in which men are\r\nmade to do more, it has been pointed out, is, by causing them either to\r\nwork longer or quicker, or else by employing fewer hands in proportion\r\nto the work; or engaging them only for such time as their services are\r\nrequired, and discharging them immediately afterwards. These constitute\r\nthe several modes of economizing labour, which lowers the rate of\r\nremuneration (the ratio of the pay to the work) rather than the pay\r\nitself. The several means by which this result is attained are termed\r\n“systems of work, production, or engagement,” and such are those above\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\nNow it is a necessity of these several systems, though the actual\r\namount of remuneration is not directly reduced by them, that a cheaper\r\nlabour should be obtained for carrying them out. Thus, in contract\r\nor lump work, perhaps, the price may not be immediately lowered; the\r\nsaving to the employer consisting chiefly in supervision, he having in\r\nsuch a case only one man to look to instead of perhaps a hundred. The\r\ncontractor, or lumper, however, is differently situated; he, in order\r\nto reap any benefit from the contract, must, since he cannot do the\r\nwhole work himself, employ others to help him, and to reap any benefit\r\nfrom the contract, this of course must be done at a lower price than he\r\nhimself receives; so it is with the middleman system, where a profit\r\nis derived from the labour of other operatives; so, again, with the\r\ndomestic system of work, where the several members of the family, or\r\ncheaper labourers, are generally employed as assistants; and even so is\r\nit with the small-master system, where the labour of apprentices and\r\nwives and children is the principal means of help. Hence the operatives\r\nadopting these several systems of work are rather the instruments by\r\nwhich cheap labour is obtained than the cheap labourers themselves. It\r\nis true that a sweater, a chamber master, or garret master, a lumper or\r\ncontractor, or a home worker, generally works cheaper than the ordinary\r\noperatives, but this he does chiefly by the cheap labourers he employs,\r\nand then, finding that he is able to underwork the rest of the trade,\r\nand that the more hands he employs the greater becomes his profit, he\r\noffers to do work at less than the usual rate. It is not a necessity\r\nof the system that the middleman operative, the domestic worker, the\r\nlumper, or garret master should be himself underpaid, but simply\r\nthat he should employ others who are so, and it is thus that such\r\nsystems of work tend to cheapen the labour of those trades in which\r\nthey are found to prevail. Who, then, are the cheap labourers?--who\r\nthe individuals, by means of whose services the sweater, the smaller\r\nmaster, the lumper, and others, is enabled to underwork the rest of his\r\ntrade?--what the general characteristics of those who, in the majority\r\nof handicrafts, are found ready to do the same work for less pay, and\r\nhow are these usually distinguished from such as obtain the higher rate\r\nof remuneration?\r\n\r\n_The cheap workmen_ in all trades, I find, are divisible into three\r\nclasses:--\r\n\r\n  1. The unskilful.\r\n  2. The untrustworthy.\r\n  3. The inexpensive.\r\n\r\nFirst, as regards the _unskilful_. Long ago it has been noticed\r\nhow frequently boys were put to trades to which their tastes and\r\ntemperaments were antagonistic. Gay, who in his quiet, unpretending\r\nstyle often elicited a truth, tells how a century and a half ago the\r\ngenerality of parents never considered for what business a boy was best\r\nadapted--\r\n\r\n    “But ev’n in infancy decree\r\n    What this or t’ other son shall be.”\r\n\r\nA boy thus brought up to a craft for which he entertains a dislike\r\ncan hardly become a proficient in it. At the present time thousands\r\nof parents are glad to have their sons reared to _any_ business which\r\ntheir means or opportunities place within their reach, even though\r\nthe lad be altogether unsuited to the craft. The consequence is, that\r\nthese boys often grow up to be unskilful workmen. There are technical\r\nterms for them in different trades, but perhaps the generic appellation\r\nis “muffs.” Such workmen, however well conducted, can rarely obtain\r\nemployment in a good shop at good wages, and are compelled, therefore,\r\nto accept second, third, and fourth-rate wages, and are often driven to\r\nslop work.\r\n\r\nOther causes may be cited as tending to form unskilful workmen:\r\nthe neglect of masters or foremen, or their incapacity to teach\r\napprentices; irregular habits in the learner; and insufficient practice\r\nduring a master’s paucity of employment. I am assured, moreover, that\r\nhundreds of mechanics yearly come to London _from the country parts_,\r\nwhose skill is altogether inadequate to the demands of the “honourable\r\ntrade.” Of course, during the finishing of their education they can\r\nonly work for inferior shops at inferior wages; hence another cause of\r\ncheap labour. Of this I will cite an instance: a bootmaker, who for\r\nyears had worked for first-rate West-end shops, told me that when he\r\ncame to London from a country town he was sanguine of success, because\r\nhe knew that he was a _ready_ man (a quick workman.) He very soon\r\nfound out, however, he said, that as he aspired to do the best work,\r\nhe “had his business to learn all over again;” and until he attained\r\nthe requisite skill, he worked for “just what he could get:” he was a\r\ncheap, because then an unskilful, labourer.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, the cheaper labour of _apprentices_, the great prop\r\nof many a slop-trader; for as such traders disregard all the niceties\r\nof work, as they disregard also the solidity and perfect finish of any\r\nwork (finishing it, as it was once described to me, “just to the eye”),\r\na lad is soon made useful, and his labour remunerative to his master,\r\nas far as slop remuneration goes, which, though small in a small\r\nbusiness, is wealth in a “monster business.”\r\n\r\nThere are, again, the “_improvers_.” These are the most frequent in the\r\ndress-making and millinery business, as young women find it impossible\r\nto form a good connection among a wealthier class of ladies in any\r\ncountry town, unless the “patronesses” are satisfied that their skill\r\nand taste have been perfected in London. In my inquiry (in the course\r\nof two letters in the _Morning Chronicle_) into the condition of the\r\nworkwomen in this calling, I was told by a retired dressmaker, who had\r\nfor upwards of twenty years carried on business in the neighbourhood\r\nof Grosvenor-square, that she had sometimes met with “improvers” so\r\ntasteful and quick, from a good provincial tuition, that they had\r\nreally little or nothing to learn in London. And yet their services\r\nwere secured for one, and oftener for two years, merely for board and\r\nlodging, while others employed in the same establishment had not only\r\nboard and lodging, but handsome salaries. The improver’s, then, is\r\ngenerally a cheap labour, and often a very cheap labour too. The same\r\nform of cheap labour prevails in the carpenter’s trade.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, the labour of _old men_. A tailor, for instance,\r\nwho may have executed the most skilled work of his craft, in his\r\nold age, or before the period of old age, finds his eyesight fail\r\nhim,--finds his tremulous fingers have not a full and rapid mastery\r\nof the needle, and he then labours, at greatly reduced rates of\r\npayment, on the making of soldiers’ clothing--“sanc-work,”[56] as it is\r\ncalled--or on any ill-paid and therefore ill-wrought labour.\r\n\r\nThe inferior, as regards the quality of the work, and under-paid class\r\nof _women_, in tailoring, for example, again, cheapen labour. It is\r\ncheapened, also, by the employment of _Irishmen_ (in, perhaps, all\r\nbranches of skilled or unskilled labour), and of _foreigners_, more\r\nespecially of Poles, who are inferior workmen to the English, and who\r\nwill work _very_ cheap, thus supplying a low-price labour to those who\r\nseek it.\r\n\r\nI may remark further, that if a first-rate workman be driven to slop\r\nwork, he soon loses his skill; he can only work slop; this has been\r\nshown over and over again, and so _his_ labour becomes cheap in the\r\nmart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2. Of _Untrustworthy Labour_ (as a cause of cheap labour) I need not\r\nsay much. It is obvious that a drunken, idle, or dishonest workman or\r\nworkwoman, when pressed by want, will and must labour, not for the\r\nrecompense the labour merits, but for whatever pittance an employer\r\nwill accord. There is no reliance to be placed in him. Such a man\r\ncannot “hold out” for terms, for he is perhaps starving, and it is\r\nknown that “he cannot be depended upon.” In the sweep’s trade many of\r\nthose who work at a lower rate than the rest of the trade are men who\r\nhave lost their regular work by dishonesty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n3. The _Inexpensive class_ of workpeople are very numerous. They\r\nconsist of three sub-divisions:--\r\n\r\n (_a._) Those who have been accustomed to a coarser kind of diet, and\r\n who, consequently, requiring less, can afford to work for less.\r\n\r\n (_b._) Those who derive their subsistence from other sources, and who,\r\n consequently, do not live by their labour.\r\n\r\n (_c._) Those who are in receipt of certain “aids to their wages,” or\r\n who have other means of living beside their work.\r\n\r\nOf course these causes can alone have influence where the wages are\r\n_minimized_ or reduced to the lowest ebb of subsistence, in which case\r\nthey become so many means of driving down the price of labour still\r\nlower.\r\n\r\n_a._ Those who, being what is designated hard-reared that is to say,\r\naccustomed to a scantier or coarser diet, and who, therefore, “can do”\r\nwith a less quantity or less expensive quality of food than the average\r\nrun of labourers, can of course live at a lower cost, and so _afford_\r\nto work at a lower rate. Among such (unskilled) labourers are the\r\npeasants from many of the counties, who seek to amend their condition\r\nby obtaining employment in the towns. I will instance the agricultural\r\nlabourers of Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\n“Bread and potatoes,” writes Mr. Thornton, in his work on\r\nOver-Population and its Remedy, p. 21, “do really form the staple of\r\ntheir food. As for meat, most of them would not know its taste, if,\r\nonce or twice _in the course of their lives_,--on the squire’s having\r\na son and heir born to him, or on the young gentleman’s coming of\r\nage,--they were not regaled with a dinner of what the newspapers call\r\n‘old English fare.’ Some of them contrive to have a little bacon, in\r\nthe proportion, it seems, of _half a pound a week to a dozen persons_,\r\nbut they more commonly use fat to give the potatoes a relish; and, as\r\none of them said to Mr. Austin (a commissioner), ‘they don’t _always_\r\ngo without cheese.’”\r\n\r\nWith many poor Irishmen the rearing has been still harder. I had some\r\nconversation with an Irish rubbish-carter, who had been thrown out\r\nof work (and was entitled to no allowance from any trade society) in\r\nconsequence of a strike by Mr. Myers’s men. On my asking him how he\r\nsubsisted in Ireland, “Will, thin, sir,” he said, “and it’s God’s\r\ntruth, I once lived for days on green things I picked up by the road\r\nside, and the turnips, and that sort of mate I stole from the fields.\r\nIt was called staling, but it was the hunger, ’deed was it. That was in\r\nthe county Limerick, sir, in the famine and ’viction times; and, glory\r\nbe to God, I ’scaped when others didn’t.”\r\n\r\nI may observe that the chief local paper, the _Limerick and Clare\r\nExaminer_, published twice a week, gave, twice a week, at the period of\r\n“the famine and evictions,” statements similar to that of my informant.\r\n\r\nNow, would not a poor man, reared as the Limerick peasant I\r\nhave spoken of, who was actually driven to eat the grass, which\r\nbiblical history shows was once a signal punishment to a great\r\noffender--would not such a man work for the veriest dole, rather than\r\nagain be subjected to the pangs of hunger? In my inquiries among the\r\ncostermongers, one of them said of the Irish in his trade, and without\r\nany bitterness, “they’ll work for nothing, and live on less.” The\r\nmeaning is obvious enough, although the assertion is, of course, a\r\ncontradiction in itself.\r\n\r\n“This department of labour,” says Mr. Baines, in his History of the\r\nHand-Loom Weavers, is “greatly overstocked, and the price necessarily\r\nfalls. The evil is aggravated by the multitudes of Irish who have\r\nflocked into Lancashire, some of whom, having been linen weavers,\r\nnaturally resort to the loom, and others learn to weave as the easiest\r\nemployment they can adopt. Accustomed to a wretched mode of living in\r\ntheir own country, they are contented with wages that would starve an\r\nEnglish labourer. They have, in fact, so lowered the _rate_ of wages as\r\nto drive many of the English out of the employment, and to drag down\r\nthose who remain in it to their own level.”\r\n\r\n_b._ Those who derive their subsistence from other sources can, of\r\ncourse, afford to work cheaper than those who have to live by their\r\nlabour. To this class belongs the labour of wives and children, who,\r\nbeing supposed to be maintained by the toil of the husband, are never\r\npaid “living wages” for what they do; and hence the misery of the\r\ngreat mass of needlewomen, widows, unmarried and friendless females,\r\nand the like, who, having none to assist them, are forced to starve\r\nupon the pittance they receive for their work. The labour of those who\r\nare in prisons, workhouses, and asylums, and who consequently have\r\ntheir subsistence found them in such places, as well as the work of\r\nprostitutes, who obtain their living by other means than work, all come\r\nunder the category of those who can afford to labour at a lower rate\r\nthan such as are condemned to toil for an honest living. It is the same\r\nwith apprentices and “improvers,” for whose labour the instruction\r\nreceived is generally considered to be either a sufficient or partial\r\nrecompense, and who consequently look to other means for their support.\r\nUnder the same head, too, may be cited the labour of amateurs, that\r\nis to say, of persons who either are not, or who are too proud to\r\nacknowledge themselves, regular members of the trade at which they\r\nwork. Such is the case with very many of the daughters of tradesmen,\r\nand of many who are considered _genteel_ people. These young women,\r\nresiding with their parents, and often in comfortable homes, at no cost\r\nto themselves, will, and do, undersell the regular needlewomen; the one\r\nworks merely for pocket-money (often to possess herself of some article\r\nof finery), while the other works for what is called “the bare life.”\r\n\r\n_c._ The last-mentioned class, or those who are in possession of what\r\nmay be called “aids to wages,” are differently circumstanced. Such are\r\nthe men who have other employment besides that for which they accept\r\nless than the ordinary pay, as is the case with those who attend at\r\ngentlemen’s houses for one or two hours every morning, cleaning boots,\r\nbrushing clothes, &c., and who, having the remainder of the day at\r\ntheir own disposal, can afford to work at any calling cheaper than\r\nothers, because not solely dependent upon it for their living.\r\n\r\nThe army and navy pensioners (non-commissioned officers and privates)\r\nwere, at one period, on the disbanding of the militia and other forces,\r\na very numerous body, but it was chiefly the military pensioners\r\nwhose position had an effect upon the labour of the country. The\r\nnaval pensioners found employment as fishermen, or in some avocation\r\nconnected with the sea. The military pensioners, however, were men\r\nwho, after a career of soldiership, were not generally disposed to\r\nsettle down into the drudgery of regular work, even if it were in\r\ntheir power to do so; and so, as they always had their pensions\r\nto depend upon, they were a sort of universal jobbers, and jobbed\r\ncheaply. At the present time, however, this means of cheap labour is\r\ngreatly restricted, compared with what was the case, the number of the\r\npensioners being considerably diminished. Many of the army pensioners\r\nturn the wheels for turners at present.\r\n\r\nThe allotment of gardens, which yield a partial support to the\r\nallottee, are another means of cheap labour. The allotment demands a\r\ncertain portion of time, but is by no means a thorough employment,\r\nbut merely an “aid,” and consequently a _means_, to low wages. Such a\r\nman has the advantage of obtaining his potatoes and vegetables at the\r\ncheapest rate, and so can afford to work cheaper than other men of his\r\nclass. It was the same formerly with those who received “relief” under\r\nthe old Poor-Law.\r\n\r\nAnd even under the present system it has been found that the same\r\npractice is attended with the same result. In the Sixth Annual Report\r\nof the Poor-Law Commissioners, 1840, at p. 31, there are the following\r\nremarks on the subject:--\r\n\r\n“Whilst upon the subject of relief to widows in aid of wages, we must\r\nnot omit to bring under your Lordship’s notice an illustration of the\r\n_depressing effect_ which is produced by the practice of giving relief\r\nin aid of wages to widows upon the earnings of females. Colonel A’Court\r\nstates:--\r\n\r\n“‘As regards females, the instance to which I have alluded presents\r\nitself in the Portsea Island Union, where, from the insufficiency of\r\nworkhouse accommodation, as well as from benevolent feelings, small\r\nallowances of 1_s._ 6_d._ or 2_s._ a week are given to widows with\r\nor without small children, or to married women deserted by their\r\nhusbands. _Having this certain income, however small, they are enabled\r\nto work at lower wages than those who do not possess this advantage._\r\nThe consequence is, that competition has enabled the shirt and stay\r\nmanufacturers, who abound in the Union, and who furnish in great\r\nmeasure the London as well as many foreign markets with these articles\r\nof their trade, to get their work done at the extraordinary low prices\r\nof--stays, complete, 9_d._; shirts, from 1_s._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ per dozen.\r\n\r\n“‘The women all declare that they cannot possibly, after working from\r\ntwelve to fifteen hours per day, earn more than 1_s._ 6_d._ per week.\r\nThe manufacturers assert that, by steady work, 4_s._ to 6_s._ a week\r\nmay be earned under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\n“‘In the meantime _the demand for workwomen increases_, and it is by no\r\nmeans unusual to see hand-bills posted over the town requiring from 500\r\nto 1000 additional stitchers.’”\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the character of the cheap workers in all trades; go\r\nwhere we will, we shall find the low-priced labour of the trade to\r\nconsist of either one or other of the three classes above-mentioned;\r\nwhile the _means_ by which this labour is brought into operation will\r\nbe generally by one of the “systems of work” before specified.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe cheap labour of the rubbish-carters’ trade appears to be a\r\nconsequence of two distinct antecedents, viz., casual labour and\r\nthe prevalence of the contract system among builder’s work. The\r\nsmall-master system also appears to have some influence upon it.\r\n\r\nFirst as regards the influence of casual labour in reducing the\r\nordinary rate of wages.\r\n\r\nThe tables given at p. 290, vol. ii., showing the wages paid to the\r\nrubbish-carters, present what appears, and indeed is, a strange\r\ndiscrepancy of payment to the labourers in rubbish-carting. About\r\nthree-fourths of the rubbish-carters throughout London receive 18_s._\r\nweekly, when in work; in Hampstead, however, the rate of their wages\r\nis (uniformly) 20_s._ a week; in Lambeth (but less uniformly), it is\r\n19_s._; in Wandsworth, 17_s._; in Islington, 16_s._; and in Greenwich,\r\n14_s._ and 12_s._ The character of the work, whether executed for\r\n12_s._ or 20_s._ weekly, is the same; why, then, can a rubbish-carter,\r\nwho works at Hampstead, earn 8_s._ a week more than one who works at\r\nGreenwich? An employer of rubbish-carters, and of similar labourers,\r\non a large scale, a gentleman thoroughly conversant with the subject\r\nin all its industrial bearings, accounts for the discrepancy in this\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\nAfter the corn and the hop-harvests have terminated, there is always an\r\ninflux of unskilled labourers into Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich.\r\nThese are the men who, from the natural bent of their dispositions, or\r\nfrom the necessity of their circumstances, resort to the casual labour\r\nafforded by the revolution of the seasons, when to gather the crops\r\nbefore the weather may render the harvest precarious and its produce\r\nunsound, is a matter of paramount necessity, and the increase of hands\r\nemployed during this season is, as a consequence, proportionately\r\ngreat. The chief scene of such labour in the neighbourhood of the\r\nmetropolis, is in the county of Kent; and on the cessation of this\r\nwork, of course there is a large amount of labour “turned adrift,”\r\nto seek, the next few days, for any casual employment that may “turn\r\nup.” In this way, I am assured, a large amount of cheap and unskilled\r\nlabour is being constantly placed at the command of those masters who,\r\nso to speak, occupy the line of march to London, and are, therefore,\r\nfirst applied to for employment by casual labourers; who, when engaged,\r\nare employed as inferior, or unskilful, workmen, at an inferior rate of\r\nremuneration. Greenwich may be looked upon as the first stage or halt\r\nfor casual labourers, on their way to London.\r\n\r\nMy informant assured me, as the result of his own observations, that\r\nan English labourer would, as a general rule, execute more work by\r\none-sixth, in a week, than an Irish labourer (a large proportion of\r\nthe casual hands are Irish); that is, the extent of work which would\r\noccupy the Irishman six, would occupy the Englishman but five days,\r\nwere it so calculated. The Englishman was, however, usually more\r\nskilled and persevering, and far more to be depended upon. So different\r\nwas the amount of work, even in rubbish-carting, between an able and\r\nexperienced hand and one unused to the toil, or one inadequate from\r\nwant of alertness or bodily strength, or any other cause, to its full\r\nand quick execution, that two “good” men in a week have done as much\r\nwork as three indifferent hands. Thus two men at 18_s._ weekly each are\r\nas cheap (only employers cannot always see it), when they are thorough\r\nmasters of their business, as three unready hands at 12_s._ a week\r\neach. The misfortune, however, is, that the 12_s._ a week men have a\r\ntendency to reduce the 16_s._ to their level.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the difference between the wages of Hampstead and\r\nGreenwich, I am informed that stationary working rubbish-carters\r\nare not too numerous in Hampstead, which is considered as rather\r\n“out of the way;” and as that metropolitan suburb is surrounded in\r\nevery direction by pasture-land and wood-land, it is not in the\r\nline of resort of the class of men who seek the casual labour in\r\nharvesting, &c., of which I have spoken; it is rarely visited by them,\r\nand consequently, the regular hands are less interfered with than\r\nelsewhere, and wages have not been deteriorated.\r\n\r\nThe mode of work among the scurf labourers differs somewhat from\r\nthat of the honourable part of the trade; the work executed by the\r\nscurf masters being for the most part on a more limited scale than\r\nthat of the others. To meet the demands of builders or of employers\r\ngenerally, when “time” is an object, demands the use of relays of men,\r\nand of strong horses. This demand the smaller or scurf master cannot\r\nalways meet. He may find men, but not always horses and carts, and\r\nhe will often enough undertake work beyond his means and endeavour\r\nto aggrandise his profits by screwing his labourers. The _hours of\r\nscurf-employed labour_ are nominally the same as the regular trade, but\r\nas an Irish carter said, “it’s ralely the hours the masther plases, and\r\nthey’re often as long as it’s light.” The _scurf labourer is often paid\r\nby the day_, with “a day’s hire, and no notice beyond.” I am informed\r\nthat scurf labourers generally work an hour a day, without extra\r\nremuneration, longer than those in the honourable trade.\r\n\r\nThe rubbish-carters employed by the scurf masters are not, as a body, I\r\nam assured, so badly paid as they were a few years back. It is rarely\r\nthat labouring men can advance any feasible reason for the changes in\r\ntheir trade.\r\n\r\n_One of the main causes of the deteriorated wages_ of the\r\nrubbish-carters is the system of contracting and subletting. This,\r\nhowever, is but a branch of the ramified system of subletting in the\r\nconstruction of the “scamped” houses of the speculative builders. The\r\nbuilding of such houses is sublet, literally from cellar to chimney.\r\nThe rubbish-carting may be contracted for at a certain sum. The\r\ncontractor may sublet it to men who will do it for one-fourth less\r\nperhaps, and who may sublet the labour in their turn. For instance,\r\nthe calculation may be founded on the working men’s receiving 15_s._\r\nweekly. A contractor, a man possessing a horse, perhaps, and a couple\r\nof carts, and hiring another horse, will undertake it on the knowledge\r\nof his being able to engage men at 12_s._ or 13_s._ weekly, and so\r\nobtain a profit; indeed the reduction of price in such cases must all\r\ncome out of the labour.\r\n\r\nThis subletting, I say, is but a small part of a gigantic system,\r\nand it is an unquestionable cause of the grinding down of the\r\nrubbish-carters’ wages, and that by a class who have generally been\r\nworking men themselves, and risen to be the owners of one or two carts\r\nand horses.\r\n\r\nFrom one of these men, now a working carter, I had the following\r\naccount, which further illustrates the mode of labour as well as of\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n“I got a little a-head,” he stated, “from railway jobbing and such\r\nlike, and my father-in-law, as soon as I got married, made me a present\r\nof 20_l._ unexpected. I started for myself, thinking to get on by\r\ndegrees, and get a fresh horse and cart every year. But it couldn’t be\r\ndone, sir. If I offered to take a contract to cart the rubbish and dig\r\nit, a builder would say,--‘I can’t wait; you haven’t carts and horses\r\nenough from your own account, and I can’t wait. If you have to hire\r\nthem I can do that myself.’ I was too honest, sir, in telling the plain\r\ntruth, or I might have got more jobs. It’s not a good trade in a small\r\nway, for if your horses aren’t at work, they’re eating their heads off,\r\nand you’re fretting your heart out. Then I got to do sub-contracting,\r\nas you call it. No, it weren’t that, it was under-working. I’d go to\r\nMr. V---- as I knew, and say, ‘You’re on such a place, sir, have you\r\nroom for me?’ ‘I think not,’ he’d say, ‘I’ve only the regular thing\r\nand no advantages--10_s._ 6_d._ for a day’s work, horse and cart, or\r\n4_s._ a load.’ Those are the regular terms. Then I’d say, ‘Well, sir,\r\nI’ll do it for 8_s._ 6_d._, and be my own carman;’ and so perhaps I’d\r\nget the job, and masters often say: ‘I know I shall lose at 10_s._\r\n6_d._, but if I don’t, you shall have something over.’ Get anything\r\nover! Of course not, sir. I could have lived if I had constant work\r\nfor two horses and carts, for I would have got a cheap man; such as me\r\nmust get cheap men to drive the second cart, and under my own eye,\r\nwhenever I could; but one of my poor horses broke his leg, and had to\r\nbe sent to the knacker’s, and I sold the other and my carts, and have\r\nworked ever since as a labouring man; mainly at pipe-work. O, yes, and\r\nrubbish-carting. I get 18_s._ a week now, but not regular.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, I’m sure I can’t say, and I think no man could say, how\r\nmuch there’s doing in sub-contracting. If I’m at work in Cannon-street,\r\nI don’t know what’s doing at Notting-hill, or beyond Bow and Stratford.\r\nNo, I’m satisfied there’s not so much of it as there was, but it’s done\r\nso on the sly; who knows how much is done still, or how little? It’s a\r\nsystem as may be carried on a long time, and is carried on, as far as\r\nmen’s labour goes, but it’s different where there’s horses, and stable\r\nrent. They can’t be screwed, or under-fed, beyond a certain pitch, or\r\nthey couldn’t work at all, and so there’s not as much under-work about\r\nhorse-labour.”\r\n\r\nThese small men are among the scurf and petty rubbish-carters, and are\r\noften the means of depressing the class to which they have belonged.\r\n\r\nThe employment in the honourable trade at rubbish-carting would be\r\none of the best among unskilled labourers, were it continuous. But it\r\nis not continuous, and three-fourths of those engaged in it have only\r\nsix months’ work at it in the year. In the scurf-masters’ employ, the\r\nwork is really “casual,” or, as I heard it quite as often described,\r\n“chance.” In both departments of this trade, the men out of work look\r\nfor a job in scavagery, and very generally in night-work, or, indeed,\r\nin any labour that offers. The Irish rubbish-carters will readily\r\nbecome hawkers of apples, oranges, walnuts, and even nuts, when out of\r\nemploy, so working in concert with their wives. I heard of only four\r\ninstances of a similar resource by the English rubbish-carters.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of the education, religion, politics, concubinage,\r\n&c., &c., of the better-paid rubbish-carters would have but to be\r\nrepeated, if I described those of the under-paid. The latter may be\r\nmore reckless when they have the means of enjoyment, but their diet,\r\namusements, and expenditure would be the same, were their means\r\ncommensurate. As it is, they sometimes live very barely and have hardly\r\nany amusements at their command. Their dinners, when single men, are\r\noften bread and a saveloy; when married, sometimes tea and bread and\r\nbutter, and occasionally some “block ornaments;” the Irish being the\r\nprincipal consumers of cheap fish.\r\n\r\nThe labour of the wives of the rubbish-carters is far more frequently\r\nthat of char-women than of needle-women, for the great majority\r\nof these women before their marriage were servant-maids. All the\r\ninformation I received was concurrent in that respect. The wife of a\r\ncarman who keeps a chandler’s shop near the Edgeware-road, greatly\r\nresorted to by the class to which her husband belonged, told me that\r\nout of somewhere about 25 wives of rubbish-carters or similar workmen,\r\nwhom she knew, 20 had been domestic servants; what the others had been\r\nshe did not know.\r\n\r\n“I can tell you, sir,” said the woman, “charing is far better than\r\nneedle-work; far. If a young woman has conducted herself well in\r\nservice, she can get charing, and then if she conducts herself well\r\nagain, she makes good friends. That’s, of course, if they’re honest,\r\nsir. I know it from experience. My husband--before we were able to open\r\nthis shop--was in the hospital a long time, and I went out charing,\r\nand did far better than a sister I have, who is a capital shirt-maker.\r\nThere’s broken victuals, sometimes, for your children. It’s a hard\r\nworld, sir, but there’s a many good people in it.”\r\n\r\nOne woman (before mentioned) earned not less than 5_s._ weekly in\r\nsuperior shirt-making, as it was described to me, which was evidently\r\nlooked upon as a handsome remuneration for such toil. Another earned\r\n3_s._ 6_d._; another 2_s._ 6_d._; and others, with uncertain employ,\r\n2_s._, 1_s._ 6_d._, and in some weeks nothing. Needle-work, however,\r\nis, I am informed, not the work of one-tenth of the rubbish-carters’\r\nwives, whatever the earnings of the husband. From all I could learn,\r\ntoo, the wives of the under-paid rubbish-carters earned more, by\r\nfrom 10 to 20 per cent., than those of the better-paid. The earnings\r\nof a charwoman in average employ, as regards the wives of the\r\nrubbish-carters, is about 4_s._ weekly, without the exhausting toil of\r\nthe needle-woman, and with the advantage of sometimes receiving broken\r\nmeat, dripping, fat, &c., &c. The wives of the Irish labourers in this\r\ntrade are often all the year street-sellers, some of wash-leathers,\r\nsome of cabbage-nets, and some of fruit, clearing perhaps from 6_d._ to\r\n9_d._ a day, if used to street-trading, as the majority of them are.\r\n\r\nThe under-paid labourers in this trade are chiefly poor Irishmen. The\r\nIrish workmen in this branch of the trade have generally been brought\r\nup “on the land,” as they call it, in their own country, and after the\r\nsufferings of many of them during the famine, 12_s._ a week is regarded\r\nas “a rise in the world.”\r\n\r\nFrom one of this class I learned the following particulars. He seemed a\r\nman of 26 or 28:--\r\n\r\n“I was brought up on the land, sir,” he said, “not far from Cullin, in\r\nthe county Wexford. I lived with my father and mother, and shure we\r\nwere badly off. Shure, thin, we were. Father and mother--the Heavens be\r\ntheir bed--died one soon after another, and some friends raised me the\r\nmanes to come to this country. Well, thin, indeed, sir, and I can’t say\r\nhow they raised them, God reward them. I got to Liverpool, and walked\r\nto London, where I had some relations. I sold oranges in the strates\r\nthe first day I was in London. God help me, I was glad to do anything\r\nto get a male’s mate. I’ve lived on 6_d._ a-day sometimes. I have\r\nindeed. There was 2_d._ for the lodging, and 4_d._ for the mate, the\r\ntay and bread and butter. Did I live harder than that in Ireland, your\r\nhonour? Well, thin, I have. I’ve lived on a dish of potatoes that might\r\ncost a penny there, where things is bhutiful and chape. Not like this\r\ncountry. No, no. I wouldn’t care to go back. I have no friends there\r\nnow. Thin I got ingaged by a man--yis, he was a rubbish-carter--to\r\nhelp him to fill his cart, and then we shot it on some new garden\r\ngrounds, and had to shovel it about to make the grounds livil, afore\r\nthe top soil was put on, for the bhutiful flowers and the gravel walks.\r\nTim--yis, he was a counthryman of mine, but a Cor-rk man--said he’d\r\nmade a bad bargain, for he was bad off, and he only clared 4_d._ a\r\nload, and he’d divide it wid me. We did six loads in a day, and I got\r\n1_s._ every night for a wake. This was a rise. But one Sunday evening\r\nI was standing talking with people as lived in the same coort, and\r\nI tould how I was helping Tim. And two Englishmen came to find four\r\nmen as they wanted for work, and ould Ragin (Regan) tould them what I\r\nwas working for. And one of ’em said, I was ‘a b---- Irish fool,’ and\r\nould Ragin said so, and words came on, and thin there was a fight, and\r\nthe pelleece came, and thin the fight was harder. I was taken to the\r\nstation, and had a month. I had two black eyes next morning, but was\r\nwillin’ to forget and forgive. No, I’m not fond of fightin’. I’m a\r\npaceable man, glory be to God, and I think I was put on. Oh, yis, and\r\nindeed thin, your honour, it was a fair fight.”\r\n\r\nI inquired of an English rubbish-carter as to these fair fights. He\r\nknew nothing of the one in question, but had seen such fights. They\r\nwere usually among the Irish themselves, but sometimes Englishmen were\r\n“drawn into them.” “Fair fights! sir,” he said, “why the Irishes don’t\r\nstand up to you like men. They don’t fight like Christians, sir; not a\r\nbit of it. They kick, and scratch, and bite, and tear, like devils, or\r\ncats, or women. They’re soon settled if you can get an honest knock at\r\nthem, but it isn’t easy.”\r\n\r\n“I sarved my month,” continued my Irish informant, “and it ain’t a bad\r\nplace at all, the prison. I tould the gintleman that had charge of us,\r\nthat I was a Roman Catholic, God be praised, and couldn’t go to his\r\nprayers. ‘O very well, Pat,’ says he. And next day the praste came, and\r\nwe were shown in to him, and very angry he was, and said our conduc’\r\nwas a disgrace to religion, and to our counthry, and to him. Do I think\r\nhe was right, sir? God knows he was, or he wouldn’t have said so.\r\n\r\n“I hadn’t been out of prison two hours before I was hired for a job, at\r\n10_s._ a week. It was in the city, and I carried old bricks and rubbish\r\nalong planks, from the inside of a place as was pulled down; but the\r\noutside, all but the roof, was standin’ until the windor frames, and\r\nthe door posts, and what other timbers there was, was sould. It was\r\ndreadful hard work, carrying the basket of rubbish on your back to the\r\ncart. The dust came through, and stuck to my neck, for I was wet all\r\nover wid sweatin’ so. Every man was allowed a pint of beer a day, and\r\nI thought nivver anything was so sweet. I don’t know who gave it. The\r\nmasther, I suppose. Will, thin, sir, I don’t know who was the masther;\r\nit was John Riley as ingaged me, but _he’s_ no masther. Yis, thin,\r\nand I’ve been workin’ that way ivver since. I’ve sometimes had 14_s._\r\na week, and sometimes 10_s._, and sometimes 12_s._ A man like me\r\nmust take what he can get, and I will take it. I’ve been out of work\r\nsometimes, but not so much as some, for I’m young and strong. No, I\r\ncan’t save no money, and I have nothing just now to save it for. When\r\nI’m out of work, I sell fruit in the streets.”\r\n\r\nThis statement, then, as regards the Irish labourers, shows the\r\nquality of the class employed. The English labourers, working on the\r\nsame terms, are of the usual class of men so working,--broken-down\r\nmen, unable, or accounting themselves unable, to “do better,” and so\r\naccepting any offer affording the means of their daily bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LONDON CHIMNEY-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\nChimney-Sweepers are a consequence of two things--chimneys and the\r\nuse of coals as fuel; and these are both commodities of comparatively\r\nrecent introduction.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that the earliest mention of _chimneys_ is\r\nin an Italian MS., preserved in Venice, in which it is recorded that\r\nchimneys were thrown down in that city from the shock of an earthquake\r\nin 1347. In England, down even to the commencement of the reign of\r\nElizabeth, the greater part of the houses in our towns had no chimneys;\r\nthe fire was kindled on a hearth-stone on the floor, or on a raised\r\ngrate against the wall or in the centre of the apartment, and the smoke\r\nfound its way out of the doors, windows, or casements.\r\n\r\nDuring the long, and--as regards civil strife--generally peaceful,\r\nreign of Elizabeth, the use of chimneys increased. In a Discourse\r\nprefixed to an edition of Holinshed’s “Chronicles,” in 1577, Harrison,\r\nthe writer, complains, among other things, “marvellously altered for\r\nthe worse in England,” of the multitude of chimneys erected of late.\r\n“Now we have many chimneys,” he says, “and our tenderlings complain\r\nof rheums, catarrhs, and poses. Then we had none but _reredoses_,\r\nand our heads did never ache.”[57] He demurs, too, to the change in\r\nthe material of which the houses were constructed: “Houses were once\r\nbuilded of willow, then we had oaken men; but now houses are made of\r\noak, and our men not only become willow, but a great many altogether of\r\nstraw, which is a sore alteration.”\r\n\r\nIn Shakespeare’s time, the chimney-sweepers seem to have become a\r\nrecognised class of public cleansers, for in “Cymbeline” the poet says--\r\n\r\n    “Fear no more the heat o’ the sun,\r\n      Nor the furious winter’s rages;\r\n    Thou thy worldly task hast done,\r\n      Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages:\r\n    Golden lads and girls all must,\r\n      _As chimney-sweepers_ come to dust.”\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful passage there is an intimation, by the\r\n“chimney-sweepers” being contrasted with the “golden lads and girls,”\r\nthat their employment was regarded as of the meanest, a repute it bears\r\nto the present day.\r\n\r\nBut chimneys seem, like the “sweeps” or “sweepers,” to have been a\r\nnecessity of a change of fuel. In the days of “rere-dosses,” our\r\nancestors burnt only wood, so that they were not subjected to so\r\ngreat an inconvenience as we should be were our fires kindled without\r\nthe vent of the chimney. Our fuel is coal, which produces a greater\r\nquantity of soot, and of black smoke, which is the result of imperfect\r\ncombustion, than any other fuel, the smoke from wood being thin and\r\npure in comparison.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of the use of coal as fuel occurs in a charter of\r\nHenry III., granting licence to the burgesses of Newcastle to dig for\r\ncoal. In 1281 Newcastle is said to have had some slight trade in this\r\narticle. Shortly afterwards coal began to be imported into London for\r\nthe use of smiths, brewers, dyers, soap-boilers, &c. In 1316, during\r\nthe reign of Edward I., its use in London was prohibited because of the\r\nsupposed injurious influence of the smoke. In 1600 the use of coal in\r\nthe metropolis became universal; about 200 vessels were employed in the\r\nLondon trade, and about 200,000 chaldrons annually imported.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, however, there were, besides the railway-borne coals, 12,267\r\ncargoes imported, or 3,418,340 tons. The London coal trade now employs\r\n2700 vessels and 21,600 seamen, and constitutes one-fourth of the whole\r\ngeneral trade of the Thames.\r\n\r\nTo understand the _necessity_ for chimney-sweepers, and the extent\r\nof the work for them to do, that is to say, the quantity of soot\r\ndeposited in our chimneys during the combustion of the three and a half\r\nmillions of tons of coals that are now annually consumed in London,\r\nwe must first comprehend the conditions upon which the evolution\r\nof soot depends, soot being simply the fine carbonaceous particles\r\ncondensed from the smoke of coal fuel, and deposited against the sides\r\nof the chimneys during its ascent between the walls to the tops of\r\nour houses. These conditions appear to have been determined somewhat\r\naccurately during the investigations of the Smoke Prevention Committee.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of smoke from the ordinary materials of\r\ncombustion--(A) _Opaque_, or black smoke; (B) _Transparent_, or\r\ninvisible smoke.\r\n\r\n A. The _Opaque_ smoke, though the most offensive and annoying from\r\n its dirtying properties, is, like the muddiest water, the least\r\n injurious to animal or vegetable health. It consists of the particles\r\n of unconsumed carbon which have not been deposited in the form of soot\r\n in the flue or chimney. This is the black smoke which will be further\r\n described.\r\n\r\n B. _Transparent_ smoke is composed of gases which are for the most\r\n part invisible, such as carbonic acid and carbonic oxide; also of\r\n sulphurous acid, but smokes with that component are both visible and\r\n invisible. The sulphurous acid is said by Professor Brande to destroy\r\n vegetation, for it has long been a cause of wonder why vegetation\r\n in towns did not flourish, since carbonic acid (which is so largely\r\n produced from the action of our fires) is the vital air of trees,\r\n shrubs, and plants[58].\r\n\r\nI may here observe, that several of the scientific men who gave\r\nthe results of years of observation and study in their evidence\r\nto the Committee of the House of Commons, remarked on the popular\r\nmisunderstanding of what smoke was, it being generally regarded as\r\nsomething _visible_. But in the composition of smoke, it appears, one\r\nproduct may be visible, and another invisible, and both offensive;\r\nwhile “occasionally you may have from the same materials varieties of\r\nproducts, all invisible, according to the manner to which they are\r\nsupplied with air.”\r\n\r\nThe Committee requested Dr. Reid to prepare a definition of “smoke,”\r\nand more especially of “black smoke.” The following is the substance of\r\nthe doctor’s definition, or rather description:--\r\n\r\n1. _Black Smoke_ consists essentially of carbon separated by heat\r\nfrom coal or other combustible bodies. If this smoke be produced\r\nat a very high temperature, the carbon forms a loose and powdery\r\nsoot, comparatively free from other substances; while the lower the\r\ntemperature at which black soot is formed, the larger is the amount\r\nof other substances with which it is mingled, among which are the\r\nfollowing:--carbon, water, resin, oily and other inflammable products\r\nof various volatilities, ammonia, and carbonate of ammonia.\r\n\r\nWhen the carbon, oils, resin, and water are associated together in\r\ncertain proportions, they constitute _tar_. _Soft pitch_ is produced if\r\nthe tar be so far heated that the water is expelled; and _hard pitch_\r\n(resin blackened by carbon) when the oils are volatilized.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of ordinary combustion, carbonic acid is formed by the\r\nred-hot cinders, or by gases or other compounds containing carbon,\r\nacting on the oxygen of the air. This carbonic acid is discharged\r\nin general as an _invisible_ gas. If the carbonic acid pass through\r\nred-hot cinders, or any carbonaceous smoke at a high temperature, it\r\nloses one particle of oxygen, and becomes carbonic oxide gas. The lost\r\noxygen, uniting with carbon, forms an additional amount of carbonic\r\noxide gas, which passes to the external atmosphere as an invisible gas,\r\nunless kindled in its progress, or at the top of the chimney, when its\r\ntemperature is sufficiently elevated by the action of air. Carbonic\r\noxide gas burns with a blue flame, and produces carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nBlack smoke is always associated with carburetted hydrogen gases. These\r\nmay be mechanically blended with the oils and resins, but must be\r\ncarefully distinguished from them. They form more essentially, when in\r\na state of combustion, the inflammable matters that constitute flame.\r\n\r\n2. _Smoke from Charcoal, Coke, and Anthracite_, is always invisible if\r\nthe material be dry. A flame may appear, however, if carbonic oxide be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n3. _Wood or Pyroligneous Smoke_ is rarely black. Water and carbonic\r\nacid are the products of the full combustion of wood, omitting the\r\nconsideration of the ash that remains.\r\n\r\n4. _Sulphurous Smokes._ Tons of sulphur are annually evolved in various\r\nconditions from copper-works. Offensive sulphurous smokes are often\r\nevolved from various chemical works, as gas-works, acid-works, &c.\r\n\r\n5. _Hydrochloric Acid Smoke_ is evolved in general in large quantities\r\nfrom alkali works.\r\n\r\n6. _Metallic Smokes_--when ores of lead, copper, arsenic, &c., are\r\nused--often contain offensive matter in a minute state of division, and\r\nsuspended in the smoke evolved from the furnaces.\r\n\r\n7. _Putrescent Smokes_, loaded with the products of decayed animal and\r\nvegetable matter, are evolved at times from drains in visible vapours,\r\nmore especially in damp weather. The fœtid particles, when associated\r\nwith moisture in this smoke, are entirely decomposed when subjected to\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nDr. Ure says, speaking of the cause of the ordinary black smoke above\r\ndescribed, “The inevitable conversion of atmospheric air into carbonic\r\nacid has been hitherto the radical defect of almost all furnaces. The\r\nconsequence is, that this gaseous matter is mixed with an atmosphere\r\ncontaining far too little oxygen, and instead of burning the carbon\r\nand hydrogen, which constitute the coal gases, the carbon is deposited\r\npartly in a pulverized form, constituting smoke or soot, and a great\r\ndeal of the carbon gets half-burnt, and forms what is well known under\r\nthe name of carbonic oxide, which is half-burnt charcoal.”\r\n\r\n“The ordinary smoke,” Professor Faraday said, in his examination before\r\nthe Committee, “is the visible black part of the products, the unburnt\r\nportions of the carbon. If you prevent the production of carbonic oxide\r\nor carbonic acid, you increase the production of smoke. You must with\r\ncoal fuel either have carbonic acid or oxide, or else black smoke.\r\n\r\n“Which is the least noxious?” he was asked, and answered, “As far as\r\nregards health, carbonic acid and carbonic oxide are most noxious to\r\nhealth; but it is not so much a question of health as of cleanliness\r\nand comfort, because I believe that this town is as healthy as other\r\nplaces where there are not these fires.\r\n\r\n“It is partly the impure coal gas evolved after the fresh charge of\r\ncoal which originates the smokes, when not properly supplied with air;\r\nbut it is a very mixed question. When a fresh charge of coal is put\r\nupon the fire, a great quantity of evaporable matter, which would be\r\ncalled impure coal gas according to the language of the question, is\r\nproduced; and as that matter travels on in the heated place, if there\r\nbe a sufficient supply of air, both the hydrogen and the carbon are\r\nentirely burnt. But if there be an insufficient supply of air, the\r\nhydrogen is taken possession of first, and the carbon is set free in\r\nits black and solid form; and if that goes into the cool part of the\r\nchimney before fresh air gets to it, that carbon is so carried out\r\ninto the atmosphere and is the smoke in question. Generally speaking,\r\nthe great rush of smoke is when coal is first put on the fire; and\r\nthat from the want of a sufficient supply of oxygen at the right time,\r\nbecause the carbon is cooled so low as not to take fire.”\r\n\r\nThis eminent chemist stated also that there was no difference in the\r\nultimate chemical effect upon the air between a wood fire and a coal\r\nfire, but with wood there was not so much smoke set free in the heated\r\nplace, which caused a difference in the gaseous products of wood\r\ncombustion and of coal combustion. He thought that perhaps wood was\r\nthe fuel which would be most favourable to health as affecting the\r\natmosphere, inasmuch as it produced more water, and less carbonic acid,\r\nas the product of combustion.\r\n\r\nWhat may be called the _peculiarities_ of a smoky and sooty atmosphere\r\nare of course more strongly developed in London than elsewhere, as the\r\nfollowing curious statements show:--\r\n\r\nDr. Reid, in describing metropolitan smoke, spoke of “those black\r\nportions of soot that every one is familiar with, which annoy us, for\r\ninstance, at the Houses of Parliament to such an extent that I have\r\nbeen under the necessity of putting up a veil, about 40 feet long and\r\n12 feet deep, on which, on a single evening, taking the worst kind of\r\nweather for the production of soot, we can count occasionally 200,000\r\nvisible portions of soot excluded at a single sitting. We count with\r\nthe naked eye the number of pieces entangled upon a square inch. I\r\nhave examined the amount deposited on different occasions in different\r\nparts of London at the tops of some houses; and on one occasion at the\r\nHorse Guards the amount of soot deposited was so great, that it formed\r\na complete and continuous film, so that when I walked upon it I saw\r\nthe impression of my foot left as distinctly on that occasion as when\r\nsnow lies upon the ground. The film was exceedingly thin, but I could\r\ndiscover no want of continuity. On other occasions I have noticed in\r\nLondon that the quantity that escapes into individual houses is so\r\ngreat that in a single night I have observed a mixture of soot and of\r\nhoar frost collecting at the edge of the door, and forming a stripe\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in breadth, and bearing an exact resemblance\r\nto a pepper and salt grey cloth. Those that I refer to are extreme\r\noccasions.”\r\n\r\nMr. Booth mentioned, that one of the gardeners of the Botanic Garden in\r\nthe Regent’s-park, could tell the number of days sheep had been in the\r\npark from the blackness of their wool, its oleaginous power retaining\r\nthe black.\r\n\r\nDr. Ure informed the Committee that a column of smoke might be seen\r\nextending in different directions round London, according to the way of\r\nthe wind, for a distance of from 20 to 30 miles; and that Sir William\r\nHerschel had told him that when the wind blew from London he could not\r\nuse his great telescope at Slough.\r\n\r\nIt was stated, moreover, that when a respirator is washed, the water is\r\nrendered dirty by the particles of soot adhering to the wire gauze, and\r\nwhich, but for this, would have entered the mouth.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brande said, on the subject of the public health being\r\naffected by smoke, “I cannot say that my opinion is that smoke produces\r\nany unhealthiness in London; it is a great nuisance certainly; but I\r\ndo not think we have any good evidence that it produces disease of any\r\nkind.”\r\n\r\n“This Committee,” said Mr. Beckett, “have been told that, by the\r\nmechanical effects of smoke upon the chest and lungs, disease\r\ntakes place; that is, by swallowing a certain quantity of smoke\r\nthe respiratory organs are injured; can you give any opinion upon\r\nthat?”--“One would conceive,” replied the Professor, “that that is the\r\ncase; but when we compare the health of London with that of any other\r\ntown or place where they are comparatively free or quite free from\r\nsmoke, we do not find that difference which we should expect in regard\r\nto health.”\r\n\r\nMr. E. Solly, lecturer on chemistry at the Royal Institution, expressed\r\nhis opinion of the effect of smoke upon the health of towns:--\r\n\r\n“My impression is,” he said, “that it produces decided evil in two or\r\nthree ways: first, mechanically; the solid black carbonaceous matter\r\nproduces a great deal of disease; it occasions dirt amongst the lower\r\norders, and, if they will not take pains to remove it, it engenders\r\ndisease. If we could do away the smoke nuisance, I believe a great deal\r\nof that disease would be put an end to. But there is another point, and\r\nthat is, the bad effects produced by the gases, sulphurous acid and\r\nother compounds of that nature, which are given out. If we do away with\r\nsmoke, we shall still have those gases; and I have no doubt that those\r\ngases produce a great part of the disease that is produced by smoke.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Dr. Reid thought that smoke was more injurious from\r\nthe dirt it created than from causing impurity in the atmosphere,\r\nalthough “it was obvious enough that the inspiration of a sooty\r\natmosphere must be injurious to persons of a delicate constitution.”\r\nDr. Ure pronounced smoke, in the common sense of visible black smoke,\r\nunwholesome, but “not so eminently as the French imagine.”\r\n\r\nMany witnesses stated their conviction that where poor people resided\r\namongst smoke, they felt it impossible to preserve cleanliness in\r\ntheir persons or their dwellings, and that made them careless of\r\ntheir homes and indifferent to a decency of appearance, so that the\r\npublic-house, and places where cleanliness and propriety were in no\r\ngreat estimation, became places of frequent resort, on the plain\r\nprinciple that if a man’s home were uncomfortable, he was not likely to\r\nstay in it.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Mr. Booth, “one great effect of the evil of smoke is\r\nupon the dwellings of the poor; it renders them less attentive to their\r\npersonal appearance, and, in consequence, to their social condition.”\r\n\r\nIt was also stated that there were “certain districts inhabited by\r\nthe poor, where they will not hang out their clothes to be cleansed;\r\nthey say it is of no use to do it, they will become dirty as before,\r\nand consequently they do not have their clothes washed.” The districts\r\nspecified as presenting this characteristic are St. George’s-in-the\r\nEast and the neighbourhood of Old-street, St. Luke’s.\r\n\r\nIt must not be lost sight of, that whatever evils, moral or physical,\r\nwithout regarding merely pecuniary losses, are inflicted by the excess\r\nof smoke, they fall upon the poor, and almost solely on the poor. It is\r\nthe poor who must reside, as was said, and with a literality not often\r\napplicable to popular phrases, “in the thick of it,” and consequently\r\nthere must either be increased washing or increased dirt.\r\n\r\nTo effect the mitigation of the nuisance of smoke, two points were\r\nconsidered:--\r\n\r\n A. The substitution of some other material, containing less bituminous\r\n matter, for the “Newcastle coal.”\r\n\r\n B. The combustion of the smoke, before its emission into the\r\n atmospheric air, by means of mechanical contrivances founded on\r\n scientific principles.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first consideration (A) it was recommended that\r\nanthracite, or stone Welsh coal, which is a smokeless fuel, should be\r\nused instead of the Newcastle coal. This coal is almost the sole fuel\r\nin Philadelphia, a city of Quaker neatness beyond any in the United\r\nStates of North America, and sometimes represented as the cleanest in\r\nthe world. The anthracite coal is somewhat dearer than Newcastle coal\r\nin London, but only in a small degree.\r\n\r\n_Coke_ was also recommended as a substitute for coal in private\r\ndwellings.\r\n\r\n“Are you of opinion,” Dr. Reid was asked, “that smoke may be in a great\r\nmeasure prevented by extending the use of gas and coke?” He answered,\r\n“In numerous cities, where large quantities of gas are produced, coke\r\nis very frequently the principal fuel of the poor, and the difficulty\r\nof lighting that coke, and the difficulty of having heat developed\r\nby it in sufficient quantity, necessarily led me to look at the\r\nconstruction of the fire-places adapted for it. And on a general review\r\nof the question, I do entertain the opinion, that if education were\r\nmore extended amongst the humblest classes with respect to the economy\r\nof their own fireside (I mean, literally, the fire-place, at present),\r\nand if gas were greatly extended, so that they did not drain the coal\r\nof the gas-works of the last dregs of gaseous matter, which are of very\r\nlittle use as gas, and more to be considered as adding to the bulk for\r\nsale than as valuable gas, that a coke might be left which would be\r\neasily accendible, which would be economical, and which, if introduced\r\ninto fire-places where an open fire is desired, would _entirely remove\r\nthe necessity of sweeping chimneys even with machines_, and would at\r\nthe same time give as economical a fire as any ordinary fire-place can\r\nproduce, for an ordinary coal fire rarely is powerful in its calorific\r\nemanations till the mass of gas has been expelled, and we see the\r\ncherry-red fire. The amount of gas that has escaped previously to the\r\nproduction or coking of the fire, is the gas that is valuable in a\r\nmanufactory, and if therefore the individual consumer could have, not\r\nthe hard-burnt stony coke, but the soft coke, in the condition that\r\nwould give at once a cherry-red fire, we should attain the two great\r\nobjects--of economising gas, and at the same time of having a lively\r\ncheerful fire. Then this led me to look particularly at the price of a\r\ngas lamp for a poor man. In a poor man’s family, where the breakfast,\r\nthe tea and dinner, require the principal attention, and he has some\r\nplain cooking utensils, in the heat of summer I believe that he will\r\nproduce as much heat as he wants for those purposes from a single\r\nburner, which can be turned on and left all day, which shall not risk\r\nany boiling over, and by having this pure heat directed to the object\r\nto be warmed, instead of having a heavy iron grate, this plan would, if\r\ngas were generally introduced even into the humblest apartments, prove\r\na great source of economy in summer.”\r\n\r\nDr. Reid also told the Committee that there was a great prejudice\r\nagainst the use of coke, many persons considering that it produced a\r\nsulphurous smell; but as all ordinary coal coked itself, or became coke\r\nin an open fire, and was never powerfully calorific till it became\r\ncoke, the prejudice would die away.\r\n\r\nVery little is said in the Report about the smoke of private houses; an\r\nallusion, however, is made to that portion of the investigation:--“Your\r\nCommittee have received the most gratifying assurances of the confident\r\nhope entertained by several of the highest scientific authorities\r\nexamined by them, that the black smoke proceeding from fires in private\r\ndwellings, and all other places, may eventually be entirely prevented,\r\neither by the adoption of stoves and grates formed for a perfect\r\ncombustion of the common bituminous coal, or by the use of coke, or of\r\nanthracite; but they are of opinion that the present knowledge on that\r\nsubject is not such as to justify any legislative interference with\r\nthese smaller fires.”\r\n\r\n“I should, in prospect,” Professor Faraday said to the Committee, “look\r\nforward to the possibility of a great reduction of the smoke from coal\r\nfires in houses; but my impression is, that, in the present state of\r\nthings, it would be tyrannical to determine that that must be done\r\nwhich at present we do not know can be done. Still, I think there is\r\nreason to believe that it can be effected in a very high degree.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ure also thought that to extend any smoke enactment to private\r\ndwellings might be tyrannical in the present state of the chimneys,\r\nbut he had no doubt that smoke might be consumed in fires in private\r\ndwellings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the causes and remedies for smoke, and consequently of\r\nsoot, for smoke, or rather opaque smoke, consists, as we have seen, of\r\nmerely the gases of combustion with minute particles of carbon diffused\r\nthroughout them; and as smoke is the result of the imperfect burning of\r\nour coals, it follows that chimney-sweepers are but a consequence of\r\nour ignorance, and that, as we grow wiser in the art of economising our\r\nfuel, we shall be gradually displacing this branch of labourers--the\r\nmeans of preventing smoke being simply the mode of displacing the\r\nchimney-sweepers--and this is another of the many facts to teach us\r\nthat not only are we doubling our population in forty years, but we are\r\nlikewise learning every year how to do our work with a less number of\r\nworkers, either by inventing some piece of mechanism that will enable\r\none “hand” to do as much as one hundred, or else doing away with some\r\nbranch of labour altogether. Here lies the great difficulty of the\r\ntime. A new element--science, with its offspring, steam--has been\r\nintroduced into our society within the last century, decreasing labour\r\nat a time when the number of our labourers has been increasing at a\r\nrate unexampled in history; and the problem is, how to reconcile the\r\nnew social element with the old social institutions, doing as little\r\ninjury as possible to the community.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, the “smoke nuisance” entirely prevented,\r\nand that Professor Faraday’s prophecy as to the great reduction of\r\nthe smoke from coal fires in houses were fulfilled, and that the\r\nexpectations of the sanguine and intense Committee, who tell us that\r\nthey have “received _the most gratifying_ assurances of the _confident_\r\nhope entertained by several of _the highest scientific_ authorities,\r\nthat the black smoke proceeding from fires in private dwellings and all\r\nother places may be eventually _entirely_ prevented,”--suppose that\r\nthese expectations, I say, be realized (and there appears to be little\r\ndoubt of the matter), what is to become of the 1000 to 1500 “sweeps”\r\nwho live, as it were, upon this very smoke? Surely the whole community\r\nshould not suffer for them, it will be said. True; but unfortunately\r\nthe same argument is being applied to each particular section of the\r\nlabouring class,--and the labourers make up by far the greater part of\r\nthe community. If we are daily displacing a thousand labourers by the\r\nannihilation of this process, and another thousand by the improvement\r\nof that, what is to be the fate of those we put on one side? and where\r\nshall we find employment for the hundred thousand new “hands” that are\r\ndaily coming into existence among us? This is the great problem for\r\nearnest thoughtful men to work out!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut we have to deal here with the chimney-sweepers as they are, and\r\nnot as they may be in a more scientific age. And, first, as to _the\r\nquantity of soot_ annually deposited at present in the London chimneys.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of soot produced in the metropolis every year may be\r\nascertained in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nThe larger houses are swept in some instances once a month, but\r\ngenerally once in three months, and yield on an average six bushels of\r\nsoot per year. A moderate-sized house, belonging to the “middle class,”\r\nis usually swept four times a year, and gives about five bushels of\r\nsoot per annum; while houses occupied by the working and poorer classes\r\nare seldom swept more than twice, and sometimes only once, in the\r\ntwelvemonth, and yield about two bushels of soot annually.\r\n\r\nThe larger houses--the residences of noblemen and the more wealthy\r\ngentry--may, then, be said to produce an average of six bushels of\r\nsoot annually; the houses of the more prosperous tradesmen, about five\r\nbushels; while those of the humbler classes appear to yield only two\r\nbushels of soot per annum. There are, according to the last returns, in\r\nround numbers, 300,000 inhabited houses at present in the metropolis,\r\nand these, from the “reports” of the income and property tax, may be\r\nsaid to consist, as regards the average rentals, of the proportions\r\ngiven in the next page.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF HOUSES, AT DIFFERENT AVERAGE RENTALS,\r\nTHROUGHOUT THE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------------\r\n    Number of Houses whose       | Number of Houses whose      |Number of Houses whose\r\n      Average Rental is above    |   Average Rental is above   |  Average Rental is below\r\n      £50.                       |   £30 and below £50.        |  £30.\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------------+-------+-------+-------------+--------+-------\r\n                 |Average|Number |             |Average|Number |             |Average |Number\r\n                 |Rental.|  of   |             |Rental.|  of   |             |Rental. |  of\r\n                 |       |Houses.|             |       |Houses.|             |        |Houses.\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------------+-------+-------+-------------+--------+-------\r\n                 |   £   |       |             |    £  |       |             |   £    |\r\n  Hanover-square,|       |       |Poplar       |   44  | 6,882 |Chelsea      |  29    |  7,629\r\n    May Fair     |  150  | 8,795 |Pancras      |   41  |18,731 |Wandsworth   |  29    |  8,290\r\n  St. James’s    |  128  | 3,460 |Hampstead    |   40  | 1,719 |St. Luke’s   |  28    |  6,421\r\n  St. Martin’s   |  119  | 2,323 |Kensington   |   40  |17,292 |Lambeth      |  28    | 20,520\r\n  London City    |  117  | 7,329 |Clerkenwell  |   38  | 7,259 |Lewisham     |  27    |  5,936\r\n  Marylebone     |   71  |15,955 |East London  |   38  | 4,785 |Whitechapel  |  26    |  8,832\r\n  Strand         |   66  | 3,938 |St. Saviour’s|   36  | 4,613 |Hackney      |  25    |  9,861\r\n  West London    |   65  | 2,745 |Westminster  |   36  | 6,647 |Camberwell   |  25    |  9,417\r\n  St. Giles’s    |   60  | 4,778 |St. Olave’s  |   35  | 2,365 |Rotherhithe  |  23    |  2,834\r\n  Holborn        |   52  | 4,517 |Islington    |   35  |13,558 |St. George’s,|        |\r\n                 |       +-------+St. George’s-|       |       |  Southwark  |  22    |  7,005\r\n                 |       |53,840 |  in-the-East|   32  | 6,151 |Newington    |  22    | 10,468\r\n                 |       |       |             |       + ------+Greenwich    |  22    | 14,423\r\n                 |       |       |             |       |90,002 |Shoreditch   |  20    | 15,433\r\n                 |       |       |             |       |       |Stepney      |  20    | 16,346\r\n                 |       |       |             |       |       |Bermondsey   |  18    |  7,095\r\n                 |       |       |             |       |       |Bethnal Green|   9    | 13,370\r\n                 |       |       |             |       |       |             |        +-------\r\n                 |       |       |             |       |       |             |        |163,880\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------------+-------+-------+-------------+--------+-------\r\n\r\nHere we see that the number of houses whose average rental is above\r\n50_l._ is 53,840; while those whose average rental is above 30_l._, and\r\nbelow 50_l._, are 90,002 in number; and those whose rental is below\r\n30_l._ are as many as 163,880; the average rental for all London,\r\n40_l._ Now, adopting the estimate before given as to the proportionate\r\nyield of soot from each of these three classes of houses, we have the\r\nfollowing items:--\r\n\r\n                                               Bushels\r\n                                             of Soot per\r\n                                               Annum.\r\n  53,840 houses at a yearly rental\r\n  above 50_l._, producing 6 bushels of\r\n  soot each per annum                          323,040\r\n\r\n  90,002 houses at a yearly rental\r\n  above 30_l._ and below 50_l._, producing\r\n  5 bushels of soot each per annum             450,010\r\n\r\n  163,880 houses at a yearly rental\r\n  below 30_l._, producing 2 bushels of\r\n  soot each per annum                          327,760\r\n                                             ---------\r\n  Total number of bushels of soot annually\r\n  produced throughout London                 1,100,810\r\n\r\nThis calculation will be found to be nearly correct if tried by another\r\nmode. The quantity of soot depends greatly upon the amount of volatile\r\nor bituminous matter in the coals used. By a table given at p. 169 of\r\nthe second volume of this work it will be seen that the proportion of\r\nvolatile matter contained in the several kinds of coal are as follows:--\r\n\r\nCannel or gas coals contain 40 to 60 per cent. of volatile matter.\r\n\r\nNewcastle or “house” coals, about 37 per cent.\r\n\r\nLancashire and Yorkshire coals, 35 to 40 per cent.\r\n\r\nSouth Welsh or “steam” coals, 11 to 15 per cent.\r\n\r\nAnthracite or “stone” coals, none.\r\n\r\nThe house coals are those chiefly used throughout London, so that\r\nevery ton of such coals contains about 800 lbs. of volatile matter, a\r\nconsiderable proportion of which appears in the form of smoke; but what\r\nproportion and what is the weight of the carbonaceous particles or soot\r\nevolved in a given quantity of smoke, I know of no means of judging. I\r\nam informed, however, by those practically acquainted with the subject,\r\nthat a ton of ordinary house coals will produce between a fourth and\r\na half of a bushel of soot[59]. Now there are, say, 3,500,000 tons\r\nof coal consumed annually in London; but a large proportion of this\r\nquantity is used for the purposes of gas, for factories, breweries,\r\nchemical works, and steam-boats. The consumption of coal for the making\r\nof gas in London, in 1849, was 380,000 tons; so that, including the\r\nquantity used in factories, breweries, &c., we may, perhaps, estimate\r\nthe domestic consumption of the metropolis at 2,500,000 tons yearly,\r\nwhich, for 300,000 houses, would give eight tons per house. And when we\r\nremember the amount used in large houses and in hotels, as well as by\r\nthe smaller houses, where each room often contains a different family,\r\nthis does not appear to be too high an average. Mr. M’Culloch estimates\r\nthe domestic consumption at one ton per head, men, women, and children;\r\nand since the number of persons to each house in London is 7·5, this\r\nwould give nearly the same result. Estimating the yield of soot to be\r\nthree-eighths of a bushel per ton, we have, in round numbers, 1,000,000\r\nbushels of soot as the gross quantity deposited in the metropolitan\r\nchimneys every year.\r\n\r\nOr, to check the estimate another way, there are 350 master sweepers\r\nthroughout London. A master sweeper in a “large way of business”\r\ncollects, I am informed, one day with another, from 30 to 40 bushels\r\nof soot; on the other hand, a small master, or “single-handed”\r\nchimney-sweeper is able to gather only about 5 bushels, and scarcely\r\nthat. One master sweeper said that about 10 bushels a day would, he\r\nthought, be a fair average quantity for all the masters, reckoning\r\none day with another; so that at this rate we should have 1,095,500\r\nbushels for the gross quantity of soot annually collected throughout\r\nthe metropolis.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore assume the aggregate yield of soot throughout London\r\nto be 1,000,000 bushels per annum. Now what is done with this immense\r\nmass of refuse matter? Of what use is it?\r\n\r\n_The soot is purchased from the masters, whose perquisite it is, by\r\nthe farmers and dealers._ It is used by them principally for meadow\r\nland, and frequently for land where wheat is grown; not so much, I\r\nunderstand, as a manure, as for some quality in it which destroys\r\nslugs and other insects injurious to the crops[60]. Lincolnshire is\r\none of the great marts for the London soot, whither it is transported\r\nby railway. In Hertfordshire, Cambridge, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and\r\nKent, however, and many other parts, London soot is used in large\r\nquantities; there are persons who have large stores for its reception,\r\nwho purchase it from the master sweepers, and afterwards sell it to\r\nthe farmers and send it as per order, to its destination. These are\r\ngenerally the manure-merchants, of whom the Post-Office Directory\r\ngives 26 names, eight being marked as dealers in guano. I was told by\r\na sweeper in a large way of business that he thought these men bought\r\nfrom a half to three-quarters of the soot; the remainder being bought\r\nby the land-cultivators in the neighbourhood of London. Soot is often\r\nused by gardeners to keep down the insects which infest their gardens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The value of the Soot_ collected throughout London is the next subject\r\nto engage our attention. Many sweepers have represented it as a very\r\ncurious fact, and one for which they could advance no sufficient\r\nreason, that the price of a bushel of soot was regulated by the price\r\nof the quartern loaf, so that you had only to know that the quartern\r\nloaf was 5_d._ to know that such was the price of a bushel of soot.\r\nThis, however, is hardly the case at present; the price of the quartern\r\nloaf (not regarding the “seconds,” or inferior bread), is now, at the\r\nend of December, 1851, 5_d._ to 6_d._ according to quality. The price\r\nof soot per bushel is but 5_d._, and sometimes but 4-1/2_d._, but 5_d._\r\nmay be taken as an average.\r\n\r\nNow 1,000,000 bushels of soot, at 5_d._, will be found to yield\r\n20,833_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._ per annum. But the whole of this quantity is\r\nnot collected by the chimney-sweepers, for many of the poorer persons\r\nseldom have their chimneys swept; and by the table given in another\r\nplace, it will be seen that not more than 800,000 bushels are obtained\r\nin the course of the year by the London “sweeps.” Hence we may say,\r\nthat there are 800,000 bushels of soot annually collected from the\r\nLondon chimneys, and that this is worth not less than 16,500_l._ per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The next question is, how many people are employed in collecting this\r\nquantity of refuse matter_, and how do they collect it, and what do\r\nthey get, individually and collectively, for so doing?\r\n\r\nTo begin with the number of master and journeymen sweepers employed in\r\nremoving these 800,000 bushels of soot from our chimneys: according to\r\nthe Census returns, the number of “sweeps” in the metropolis in the\r\nyears 1841 and 1831 were as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                    Increase\r\n                                                     in ten\r\n      _Chimney-sweepers._           1841.    1831.   years.\r\n  Males, 20 years and upwards      619      421        198\r\n    „    under 20 years            370  no returns.\r\n  Females, 20 years & upwards       44      „\r\n                                 -----\r\n                                  1033\r\n\r\nBut these returns, such as they are, include both employers and\r\nemployed, in one confused mass. To disentangle the economical knot,\r\nwe must endeavour to separate the number of master sweepers from the\r\njourneymen. According to the Post-Office Directory the master sweepers\r\namount to no more than 32, and thus there would be one more than\r\n1000 for the number of the metropolitan journeymen sweepers; these\r\nstatements, however, appear to be very wide of the truth.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 it was represented to the House of Commons, that there were\r\nwithin the bills of mortality, 200 masters, all--except the “great\r\ngentlemen,” as one witness described them, who were about 20 in\r\nnumber--themselves working at the business, and that they had 150\r\njourneymen and upwards of 500 apprentices, so that there must then have\r\nbeen 850 working sweepers altogether, young and old.\r\n\r\nThese numbers, it must be borne in mind, were comprised in the limits\r\nof the bills of mortality 34 years ago. The parishes in the old bills\r\nof mortality were 148; there are now in the metropolis proper 176, and,\r\nas a whole, the area is much more densely covered with dwelling-houses.\r\nTaking but the last ten years, 1841 to 1851, the inhabited houses have\r\nincreased from 262,737 to 307,722, or, in round numbers, 45,000.\r\n\r\nNow in 1811 the number of inhabited houses in the metropolis was\r\n146,019, and in 1821 it was 164,948; hence in 1816 we may assume the\r\ninhabited houses to have been about 155,000; and since this number\r\nrequired 850 working sweepers to cleanse the London chimneys, it is\r\nbut a rule of three sum to find how many would have been required for\r\nthe same purpose in 1841, when the inhabited houses had increased to\r\n262,737; this, according to Cocker, is about 1400; so that we must\r\ncome to the conclusion either that the number of working sweepers had\r\nnot kept pace with the increase of houses, or that the returns of\r\nthe census were as defective in this respect as we have found them\r\nto be concerning the street-sellers, dustmen, and scavagers. Were we\r\nto pursue the same mode of calculation, we should find that if 850\r\nsweepers were required to cleanse the chimneys of 155,000 houses, there\r\nshould be 1687 such labourers in London now that the houses are 307,722\r\nin number.\r\n\r\nBut it will be seen that in 1816 more than one-half (or 500 out of\r\n850) of the working chimney-sweepers were apprentices, and in 1841\r\nthe chimney-sweepers under 20 years of age, if we are to believe the\r\ncensus, constituted more than one-third of the whole body (or 370 out\r\nof 1033). Now as the use of climbing boys was prohibited in 1842, of\r\ncourse this large proportion of the trade has been rendered useless;\r\nso that, estimating the master and journeymen sweepers at 250 in 1816,\r\nit would appear that about 500 would be required to sweep the chimneys\r\nof the metropolis at present. To these, of course, must be added the\r\nextra number of journeymen necessary for managing the machines. And\r\nconsidering the journeymen to have increased threefold since the\r\nabolition of the climbing boys, we must add 300 to the above number,\r\nwhich will make the sum total of the individuals employed in this trade\r\nto amount to very nearly 800.\r\n\r\nBy inquiries throughout the several districts of the metropolis, I\r\nfind that there are altogether 350 master sweepers at present in\r\nLondon; 106 of these are large masters, who seldom go out on a round,\r\nbut work to order, having a regular custom among the more wealthy\r\nclasses; while the other 244 consist of 92 small masters and 152\r\n“single-handed” masters, who travel on various rounds, both in London\r\nand the suburbs, seeking custom. Of the whole number, 19 reside within\r\nthe City boundaries; from 90 to 100 live on the Surrey side, and 235 on\r\nthe Middlesex side of the Thames (without the City boundaries). A large\r\nmaster employs from 2 to 10 men, and 2 boys; and a small one only 2 men\r\nor sometimes 1 man and a boy, while a single-handed master employs no\r\nmen nor boys at all, but does all the work himself.\r\n\r\nThe 198 masters employ among them 12 foremen, 399 journeymen, and 62\r\nboys, or 473 hands, and adding to them the single-handed master-men who\r\nwork at the business themselves, we have 823 working men in all; so\r\nthat, on the whole, there are not less than between 800 and 900 persons\r\nemployed in cleansing the London chimneys of their soot.\r\n\r\nThe next point that presents itself in due order to the mind is, as to\r\nthe _mode of working among the chimney-sweepers_; that is to say, how\r\nare the 800,000 bushels of soot collected from the 300,000 houses by\r\nthese 820 working sweepers? But this involves a short history of the\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SWEEPERS OF OLD, AND THE CLIMBING BOYS.\r\n\r\nFormerly the chimneys used to be cleansed by the house servants,\r\nfor a person could easily stand erect in the huge old-fashioned\r\nconstructions, and thrust up a broom as far as his strength would\r\npermit. Sometimes, however, straw was kindled at the mouth of the\r\nchimney, and in that way the soot was consumed or brought down to the\r\nground by the action of the fire. But that there were also regular\r\nchimney-sweepers in the latter part of the sixteenth century is\r\nunquestionable; for in the days of the First James and Charles, poor\r\nPiedmontese, and more especially Savoyards, resorted to England for the\r\nexpress purpose. How long they laboured in this vocation is unknown.\r\nThe Savoyards, indeed, were then the general showmen and sweeps of\r\nEurope, and so they are still in some of the cities of Italy and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first introduction of English children into\r\nchimneys--the establishment of the use of climbing boys--nothing\r\nappears, according to the representations made to Parliament on several\r\noccasions, to be known; and little attention seems to have been paid\r\nto the condition of these infants--some were but little better--until\r\nabout 1780, when the benevolent Jonas Hanway, who is said, but not\r\nuncontradictedly, to have been the first person who regularly used\r\nan umbrella in the streets of London, called public attention to the\r\nmatter. In 1788 Mr. Hanway and others brought a bill into Parliament\r\nfor the better protection of the climbing boys, requiring, among other\r\nprovisions, all master sweepers to be licensed, and the names and ages\r\nof all their apprentices registered. The House of Lords, however,\r\nrejected this bill, and the 28th George III., c. 48, was passed in\r\npreference. The chief alterations sought to be effected by the new\r\nAct were, that no sweeper should have more than six apprentices, and\r\nthat no boy should be apprenticed at a tenderer age than eight years.\r\nPreviously there were no restrictions in either of those respects.\r\n\r\nThese provisions were, however, very generally violated. By one of\r\nthose “flaws” or omissions, so very common and so little creditable\r\nto our legislation, it was found that there was no prohibition to\r\na sweeper’s employing his own children at what age he pleased; and\r\n“some,” or “several,” for I find both words used, employed their sons,\r\nand occasionally their daughters, in chimney climbing at the ages\r\nof six, five, and even between four and five years! The children of\r\nothers, too, were continually being apprenticed at illegal ages, for\r\nno inquiry was made into the lad’s age beyond the statement of his\r\nparents, or, in the case of parish apprentices, beyond the (in those\r\ndays) not more trustworthy word of the overseers. Thus boys of six were\r\napprenticed--for apprenticeship was almost universal--as boys of eight,\r\nby their parents; while parish officers and magistrates consigned the\r\nworkhouse orphans, as a thing of course, to the starvation and tyranny\r\nwhich they must have known were very often in store for them when\r\napprenticed to sweepers.\r\n\r\nThe following evidence was adduced before Parliament on the subject of\r\ninfant labour in this trade:--\r\n\r\nMr. John Cook, a master sweeper, then of Great Windmill-street and\r\nKentish-town, the first who persevered in the use of the machine years\r\nbefore its use was compulsory, stated that it was common for parents in\r\nthe business to employ their own children, under the age of seven, in\r\nclimbing; and that as far as he knew, he himself was only between six\r\nand seven when he “came to it;” and that almost all master sweepers had\r\ngot it in their bills that they kept “small boys for register-stoves,\r\nand such like as that.”\r\n\r\nMr. T. Allen, another master sweeper, was between four and five when\r\narticled to an uncle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LONDON SWEEP\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nMr. B. M. Forster, a private gentleman, a member of the “Committee\r\nto promote the Superseding of Climbing Boys,” said, “Some are put to\r\nthe employment very young; one instance of which occurred to a\r\nchild in the neighbourhood of Shoreditch, who was put to the trade at\r\nfour and a quarter years, or thereabouts. The father of a child in\r\nWhitechapel told me last week, that his son began climbing when he was\r\nfour years and eight months old. I have heard of some still younger,\r\nbut only from vague report.”\r\n\r\nThis sufficiently proves at what infantine years children were exposed\r\nto toils of exceeding painfulness. The smaller and the more slenderly\r\nformed the child, the more valuable was he for the sweeping of flues,\r\nthe interior of some of them, to be ascended and swept, being but seven\r\ninches square.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the employment of female children in the very\r\nunsuitable labour of climbing chimneys. The following is all the\r\ninformation given on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Tooke was asked, “Have you ever heard of female children being\r\nso employed?” and replied, “I have heard of cases at Hadley, Barnet,\r\nWindsor, and Uxbridge; and I know a case at Witham, near Colchester, of\r\nthat sort.”\r\n\r\nMr. B. M. Foster said, “Another circumstance, which has not been\r\nmentioned to the Committee, is, that there are several little girls\r\nemployed; there are two of the name of Morgan at Windsor, daughters\r\nof the chimney-sweeper _who is employed to sweep the chimneys of\r\nthe Castle_; another instance at Uxbridge, and at Brighton, and at\r\nWhitechapel (which was some years ago), and at Headley near Barnet, and\r\nWitham in Essex, and elsewhere.” He then stated, on being asked, “Do\r\nyou not think that girls were employed from their physical form being\r\nsmaller and thinner than boys, and therefore could get up narrower\r\nflues?” “The reason that I have understood was, because their parents\r\nhad not a sufficient number of boys to bring up to the business.” Mr.\r\nFoster did not know the ages of these girls.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry by a Committee of the House of Commons, which led more\r\nthan any other to the prohibition of this infant and yet painful\r\nlabour in chimney-sweeping, was held in 1817, and they recommended the\r\n“preventing the further use of climbing boys in sweeping of chimneys;”\r\na recommendation not carried into effect until 1832. The matter was\r\nduring the interval frequently agitated in Parliament, but there were\r\nno later investigations by Committees.\r\n\r\nI will adduce, specifically, the grievances, according to the Report\r\nof 1817, of the climbing boys; but will first present the following\r\nextract from the evidence of Mr. W. Tooke, a gentleman who, in\r\naccordance with the Hon. Henry Grey Bennet, M.P., and others, exerted\r\nhimself on the behoof of the climbing boys. When he gave his evidence,\r\nMr. Tooke was the secretary to a society whose object was to supersede\r\nthe necessity of employing climbing boys. He said:--\r\n\r\n“In the year 1800, the Society for Bettering the Condition of the\r\nPoor took up the subject, but little or nothing appears to have been\r\ndone upon that occasion, except that the most respectable master\r\nchimney-sweepers entered into an association and subscription for\r\npromoting the cleanliness and health of the boys in their respective\r\nservices. The Institution of which I am treasurer, and which is now\r\nexisting, was formed in February, 1803. In consequence of an anonymous\r\nadvertisement, a large meeting was held at the London Coffee House,\r\nand the Society was established; immediate steps were then taken\r\nto ascertain the state of the trade; inspectors were appointed to\r\ngive an account of all the master chimney-sweepers within the bills\r\nof mortality, their general character, their conduct towards their\r\napprentices, and the number of those apprentices. It was ascertained,\r\nthat the total number of master chimney-sweepers, within the bills\r\nof mortality, might be estimated at 200, who had among them 500\r\napprentices; that not above 20 of those masters were reputable\r\ntradesmen in easy circumstances, who appeared generally to conform to\r\nthe provisions of the Act; and which 20 had, upon an average, from\r\nfour to five apprentices each. We found about 90 of an inferior class\r\nof master chimney-sweepers who averaged three apprentices each, and\r\nwho were extremely negligent both of the health, morals, and education\r\nof those apprentices; and about 90, the remainder of the 200 masters,\r\nwere a class of chimney-sweepers recently journeymen, who took up the\r\ntrade because they had no other resource; they picked up boys as they\r\ncould, who lodged with themselves in huts, sheds, and cellars, in the\r\noutskirts of the town, occasionally wandering into the villages round,\r\nwhere they slept on soot-bags, and lived in the grossest filth.”\r\n\r\nThe grievances I have spoken of were thus summed up by the\r\nParliamentary Committee. After referring to the ill-usage and hardships\r\nsustained by the climbing boys (the figures being now introduced for\r\nthe sake of distinctness) it is stated:--\r\n\r\n“It is in evidence that (1) they are stolen from” [and sold by]\r\n“their parents, and inveigled out of workhouses; (2) that in order to\r\nconquer the natural repugnance of the infants to ascend the narrow and\r\ndangerous chimneys to clean which their labour is required, blows are\r\nused; that pins are forced into their feet by the boy that follows them\r\nup the chimney, in order to compel them to ascend it, and that lighted\r\nstraw has been applied for that purpose; (3) that the children are\r\nsubject to sores and bruises, and wounds and burns on their thighs,\r\nknees, and elbows; and that it will require many months before the\r\nextremities of the elbows and knees become sufficiently hard to resist\r\nthe excoriations to which they are at first subject.”\r\n\r\n1. With regard to the _stealing or kidnapping of children_--for there\r\nwas often a difficulty in procuring climbing boys--I find mention\r\nin the evidence, as of a matter, but not a very frequent matter, of\r\nnotoriety. One stolen child was sold to a master sweeper for 8_l._\r\n8_s._ Mr. G. Revely said:--\r\n\r\n“I wish to state to the Committee that case in particular, because it\r\ncomes home to the better sort of persons in higher life. It seems that\r\nthe child, upon being asked various questions, had been taken away:\r\nthe child was questioned how he came into that situation; he said all\r\nthat he could recollect was (as I heard it told at that time) that he\r\nand his sister, with another brother, were together somewhere, but he\r\ncould not tell where; but not being able to run so well as the other\r\ntwo, he was caught by a woman and carried away and was sold, and came\r\nafterwards into the hands of a chimney-sweeper. He was not afterwards\r\nrestored to his family, and the mystery was never unravelled; but he\r\nwas advertised, and a lady took charge of him.\r\n\r\n“This child, in 1804, was forced up a chimney at Bridlington in\r\nYorkshire, by a big boy, the younger boy being apparently but four\r\nyears old. He fell and bruised his legs terribly against the grate.\r\nThe Misses Auckland of Boynton, who had heard of the child, and went\r\nto see him, became interested by his manners, and they took him home\r\nwith them; the chimney-sweeper, who perhaps got alarmed, being glad to\r\npart with him. Soon after he got to Boynton, the seat of Sir George\r\nStrickland, a plate with something to eat was brought him; on seeing a\r\nsilver fork he was quite delighted, and said, ‘Papa had such forks as\r\nthose.’ He also said the carpet in the drawing-room was like papa’s;\r\nthe housekeeper showed him a silver watch, he asked what sort it\r\nwas--‘Papa’s was a gold watch;’ he then pressed the handle and said,\r\n‘Papa’s watch rings, why does not yours?’ Sir George Strickland, on\r\nbeing told this circumstance, showed him a gold repeater, the little\r\nboy pressed the spring, and when it struck, he jumped about the room,\r\nsaying, ‘Papa’s watch rings so.’ At night, when he was going to bed,\r\nhe said he could not go to bed until he had said his prayers; he then\r\nrepeated the Lord’s Prayer, almost perfectly. The account he gave of\r\nhimself was that he was gathering flowers in his mamma’s garden, and\r\nthat the woman who sold him to the sweeper, came in and asked him if\r\nhe liked riding? He said, ‘Yes,’ and she told him he should ride with\r\nher. She put him on a horse, after which they got into a vessel, and\r\nthe sails were put up, ‘and away we went.’ He had no recollection of\r\nhis name, or where he lived, and was too young to think his father\r\ncould have any other name than that of papa. He started whenever he\r\nheard a servant in the family at Boynton called George, and looked as\r\nif he expected to see somebody he knew; on inquiry, he said he had an\r\nuncle George, whom he loved dearly. He says his mamma is dead, and\r\nit is thought his father may be abroad. From many things he says, he\r\nseems to have lived chiefly with an uncle and aunt, whom he invariably\r\nsays were called Mr. and Mrs. Flembrough. From various circumstances,\r\nit is thought impossible he should be the child of the woman who sold\r\nhim, his manners being ‘very civilized,’ quite those of a child well\r\neducated; his dialect is good, and that of the south of England.\r\nThis little boy, when first discovered, was conjectured to be about\r\nfour years old, and is described as having beautiful black eyes and\r\neye-lashes, a high nose, and a delicate soft skin.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. Harding, a master sweeper, had a fellow apprentice who had been\r\nenticed away from his parents. “It is a case of common occurrence,”\r\nhe said, “for children stolen, to be employed in this way. Yes, and\r\nchildren in particular are enticed out of workhouses: there are a great\r\nmany who come out of workhouses.”\r\n\r\nThe following cases were also submitted to the Committee:--\r\n\r\n“A poor woman had been obliged by sickness to go into an hospital,\r\nand while she was there her child was stolen from her house, taken\r\ninto Staffordshire, and there apprenticed to a chimney-sweeper. By\r\nsome happy circumstance she learned his fate; she followed him, and\r\nsucceeded in rescuing him from his forlorn situation. Another child,\r\nwho was an orphan, was tricked into following the same wretched\r\nemployment by a chimney-sweeper, who gave him a shilling, and made him\r\nbelieve that by receiving it he became his apprentice; the poor boy,\r\neither discovering or suspecting that he had been deceived, anxiously\r\nendeavoured to speak to a magistrate who happened to come to the house\r\nin which he was sweeping chimneys, but his master watched him so\r\nclosely that he could not succeed. He at last contrived to tell his\r\nstory to a blind soldier, who determined to right the poor boy, and by\r\n_great exertions_ succeeded in procuring him his liberty.”\r\n\r\nIt was in country places, however, that the stealing and kidnapping\r\nof children was the most frequent, and the threat of “the sweeps will\r\nget you” was often held out, to deter children from wandering. These\r\nstolen infants, it is stated, were usually conveyed to some distance\r\nby the vagrants who had secured them, and sold to some master sweeper,\r\nbeing apprenticed as the child of the vendors, for it was difficult for\r\nsweepers in thinly-peopled places to get a supply of climbing boys. It\r\nwas shown about the time of the Parliamentary inquiry, in the course of\r\na trial at the Lancaster assizes, that a boy had been apprenticed to a\r\nsweeper by two travelling tinkers, man and woman, who informed him that\r\nthe child was stolen from another “traveller,” 80 miles away, who was\r\n“too fond of it to make it a sweep.” The _price_ of the child was not\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nRespecting the sale of children to be apprentices to sweepers, Mr.\r\nTooke was able to state that, although in 1816, the practice had very\r\nmuch diminished of late, parents in many instances still _sold their\r\nchildren for three, four, or five guineas_. This sum was generally paid\r\nunder the guise of an apprentice fee, but it was known to be and was\r\ncalled a “sale,” for the parents, real or nominal, never interfered\r\nwith the master subsequently, but left the infant to its fate.\r\n\r\n2. I find the following account of the _means resorted to, in order to\r\ninduce, or more frequently compel, these wretched infants to work_.\r\n\r\nThe boy in the first instance went for a month, or any term agreed\r\nupon, “on trial,” or “to see how he would suit for the business.”\r\nDuring this period of probation he was usually well treated and well\r\nfed (whatever the character of the master), with little to do beyond\r\nrunning errands, and observing the mode of work of the experienced\r\nclimbers. When, however, he was “bound” as an apprentice, he was put\r\nwith another lad who had been for some time at the business. The new\r\nboy was sent first up the chimney, and immediately followed by the\r\nother, who instructed him how to ascend. This was accomplished by the\r\npressure of the knees and the elbows against the sides of the flue. By\r\npressing the knees tightly the child managed to raise his arms somewhat\r\nhigher, and then by pressing his elbows in like manner he contrived\r\nto draw up his legs, and so on. The inside of the flue presented a\r\nsmooth surface, and there were no inequalities where the fingers or\r\ntoes could be inserted. Should the young beginner fall, he was sure to\r\nlight on the shoulders of the boy beneath him, who always kept himself\r\nfirmly fixed in expectation of such a mishap, and then the novice had\r\nto commence anew; in this manner the twain reached the top by degrees,\r\nsweeping down the soot, and descended by the same method. This practice\r\nwas very severe, especially on new boys, whose knees and elbows were\r\ntorn by the pressure and the slipping down continually--the skin being\r\nstripped off, and frequently breaking out in frightful sores, from the\r\nconstant abrasions, and from the soot and dirt getting into them.\r\n\r\nIn his evidence before Parliament in 1817 (for there had been previous\r\ninquiries), Mr. Cook gave an account of the training of these boys, and\r\non being asked:--“Do the elbows and knees of the boys, when they first\r\nbegin the business, become very sore, and afterwards get callous, and\r\nare those boys employed in sweeping chimneys during the soreness of\r\nthose parts?” answered, “It depends upon the sort of master they have\r\ngot; some are obliged to put them to work sooner than others; you must\r\nkeep them a little at it, or they will never learn their business, even\r\nduring the sores.” He stated further, that the skin broke generally,\r\nand that the boys could not ascend chimneys during the sores without\r\n_very_ great pain. “The way that I learn boys is,” he continued, “to\r\nput some cloths over their elbows and over their knees till they get\r\nthe nature of the chimney--till they get a little used to it: we call\r\nit _padding_ them, and then we take them off, and they get very little\r\ngrazed indeed after they have got the art; but very few will take that\r\ntrouble. Some boys’ flesh is far worse than others, and it takes more\r\ntime to harden them.” He was then asked:--“Do those persons still\r\ncontinue to employ them to climb chimneys?” and the answer was: “Some\r\ndo; it depends upon the character of the master. None of them of that\r\nclass keep them till they get well; none. They are obliged to climb\r\nwith those sores upon them. I never had one of my own apprentices do\r\nthat.” This system of padding, however, was but little practised;\r\nbut in what proportion it _was_ practised, unless by the respectable\r\nmasters, who were then but few in number, the Parliamentary papers,\r\nthe only information on the subject now attainable, do not state.\r\nThe inference is, that the majority, out of but 20 of these masters,\r\nwith some 80 or 100 apprentices, did treat them well, and what was so\r\naccounted. The customary way of training these boys, then, was such as\r\nI have described; some even of the better masters, whose boys were in\r\nthe comparison well lodged and fed, and “sent to the Sunday school”\r\n(which seems to have comprised all needful education), considered\r\n“padding and such like” to be “new-fangled nonsense.”\r\n\r\nI may add also, that although the boy carried up a brush with him, it\r\nwas used but occasionally, only when there were “turns” or defects in\r\nthe chimney, the soot being brought down by the action of the shoulders\r\nand limbs. The climber wore a cap to protect his eyes and mouth from\r\nthe soot, and a sort of flannel tunic, his feet, legs, and arms being\r\nbare. Some of these lads were surprisingly quick. One man told me\r\nthat, when in his prime as a climbing boy, he could reach the top of a\r\nchimney about as quickly as a person could go up stairs to the attics.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the evidence of Mr. Cook, frequently cited as an\r\nexcellent master:--\r\n\r\n“What mode do you adopt to get the boy to go up the chimney in the\r\nfirst instance?--We persuade him as well as we can; we generally\r\npractise him in one of our own chimneys first; one of the boys\r\nwho knows the trade goes up behind him, and when he has practised\r\nit perhaps ten times, though some will require twenty times, they\r\ngenerally can manage it. The boy goes up with him to keep him from\r\nfalling; after that, the boy will manage to go up with himself, after\r\ngoing up and down several times with one under him: we do this, because\r\nif he happens to make a slip he will be caught by the other.\r\n\r\n“Do you find many boys show repugnance to go up at first?--Yes, most of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“And if they resist and reject, in what way do you force them up?--By\r\ntelling them we must take them back again to their father and mother,\r\nand give them up again; and their parents are generally people who\r\ncannot maintain them.\r\n\r\n“So that they are afraid of going back to their parents for fear of\r\nbeing starved?--Yes; they go through a deal of hardship before they\r\ncome to our trade.\r\n\r\n“Did you use any more violent means?--Sometimes a rod.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever hear of straw being lighted under them?--Never.\r\n\r\n“You never heard of any means being made use of, except being beat and\r\nbeing sent home?--No; no other.\r\n\r\n“You are aware, of course, that those means being gentle or harsh must\r\ndepend very much upon the character of the individual master?--It does.\r\n\r\n“Of course you must know that there are persons of harsh and cruel\r\ndisposition; have you not often heard of masters treating their\r\napprentices with great cruelty, particularly the little boys, in\r\nforcing them to go up those small flues, which the boys were unwilling\r\nto ascend?--Yes; I have forced up many a one myself.\r\n\r\n“By what means?--By threatenings, and by giving them a kick or a slap.”\r\n\r\nIt was also stated that the journeymen used the boys with greater\r\ncruelty than did the masters--indeed a delegated tyranny is often\r\nthe worst--that for very little faults they kicked and slapped the\r\nchildren, and sometimes flogged them with a cat, “made of rope, hard at\r\neach end, and as thick as your thumb.”\r\n\r\nMr. John Fisher, a master chimney-sweeper, said:--“Many masters, are\r\nvery severe with their children. To make them go up the chimneys I have\r\nseen them make them strip themselves naked; I have been obliged myself\r\nto go up a chimney naked.”\r\n\r\nAs respects the cruelties of driving boys up chimneys by kindling straw\r\nbeneath their feet, or thrusting pins into the soles of their feet, I\r\nfind the following statements given on the authority of B. M. Forster,\r\nEsq., a private gentleman residing in Walthamstow:--\r\n\r\n“A lad was ordered to sweep a chimney at Wandsworth; he came down\r\nafter endeavouring to ascend, and this occurred several times before\r\nhe gave up the point; at last the journeyman took some straw or hay,\r\nand lighted it under him to drive him up: when he endeavoured to get\r\nup the last time, he found there was a bar across the chimney, which\r\nhe could not pass; he was obliged in consequence to come down, and the\r\njourneyman beat him so cruelly, to use his own expression, that he\r\ncould not stand for a fortnight.\r\n\r\n“In the whole city of Norwich I could find only nine climbing boys,\r\ntwo of whom I questioned on many particulars; one was with respect to\r\nthe manner in which they are taught to climb; they both agreed in that\r\nparticular, that a larger boy was sent up behind them to prick their\r\nfeet, if they did not climb properly. I purposely avoided mentioning\r\nabout pricking them with pins, but asked them how they did it; they\r\nsaid that they thrust the pins into the soles of their feet. A third\r\ninstance occurred at Walthamstow; a man told me that some he knew had\r\nbeen taught in the same way; I believe it to be common, but I cannot\r\nstate any more instances from authority.”\r\n\r\n3. On the subject of the _sores, bruises, wounds, burns, and diseases_,\r\nto which chimney-sweepers in their apprenticeships were not only\r\nexposed, but, as it were, condemned, Mr. R. Wright, a surgeon, on being\r\nexamined before the Committee, said, “I shall begin with _Deformity_.\r\nI am well persuaded that the deformity of the spine, legs, arms, &c.,\r\nof chimney-sweepers, generally, if not wholly, proceeds from the\r\ncircumstance of their being obliged not only to go up chimneys at an\r\nage when their bones are in a soft and growing state, but likewise from\r\ntheir being compelled by their too merciless masters and mistresses\r\nto carry bags of soot (and those very frequently for a great length\r\nof distance and time) by far too heavy for their tender years and\r\nlimbs. The knees and ancle joints mostly become deformed, in the first\r\ninstance, from the position they are obliged to put them in, in order\r\nto support themselves, not only while climbing up the chimney, but more\r\nparticularly so in that of coming down, when they rest solely on the\r\nlower extremities.\r\n\r\n“_Sore eyes and eyelids_, are the next to be considered.\r\nChimney-sweepers are very subject to inflammation of the eyelids,\r\nand not unfrequently weakness of sight, in consequence of such\r\ninflammation. This I attribute to the circumstance of the soot lodging\r\non the eyelids, which first produces irritability of the part, and the\r\nconstantly rubbing them with their dirty hands, instead of alleviating,\r\nincreases the disease; for I have observed in a number of cases, when\r\nthe patient has ceased for a time to follow the business, and of course\r\nthe original cause has been removed, that with washing and keeping\r\nclean they were soon got well.\r\n\r\n“_Sores_, for the same reasons, are generally a long time in healing.\r\n\r\n“_Cancer_ is another and a most formidable disease, which\r\nchimney-sweepers in particular are liable to, especially that of\r\nthe scrotum; from which circumstance, by way of distinction, it is\r\ncalled the ‘chimney-sweeper’s cancer.’ Of this sort of cancer I have\r\nseen several instances, some of which have been operated on; but,\r\nin general, they are apt to let them go too far before they apply\r\nfor relief. Cancers of the lips are not so general as cancers of the\r\nscrotum. I never saw but two instances of the former, and several of\r\nthe latter.”\r\n\r\nThe “chimney-sweep’s cancer” was always lectured upon as a separate\r\ndisease at Guy’s and Bartholomew’s Hospitals, and on the question\r\nbeing put to Mr. Wright: “Do the physicians who are intrusted with\r\nthe care and management of those hospitals think that disease of such\r\ncommon occurrence, that it is necessary to make it a part of surgical\r\neducation?”--he replied: “Most assuredly; I remember Mr. Cline and Mr.\r\nCooper were particular on that subject; and having one or two cases\r\nof the kind in the hospital, it struck my mind very forcibly. With\r\nthe permission of the Committee I will relate a case that occurred\r\nlately, which I had from one of the pupils of St. Thomas’s Hospital;\r\nhe informed me that they recently had a case of a chimney-sweeper’s\r\ncancer, which was to have been operated on that week, but the man\r\n‘brushed’ (to use their expression) or rather walked off; he would\r\nnot submit to the operation: similar instances of which I have known\r\nmyself. They dread so much the knife, in consequence of foolish persons\r\ntelling them it is so formidable an operation, and that they will die\r\nunder it. I conceive without the operation it is death; for cancers are\r\nof that nature that unless you extricate them entirely they will never\r\nbe cured.”\r\n\r\nOf the chimney-sweeper’s cancer, the following statement is given in\r\nthe Report: “Mr. Cline informed your Committee by letter, that this\r\ndisease is rarely seen in any other persons than chimney-sweepers,\r\nand in them cannot be considered as frequent; for during his practice\r\nin St. Thomas’s hospital, for more than 40 years, the number of those\r\ncould not exceed 20. But your Committee have been informed that the\r\ndread of the operation which it is necessary to perform, deters many\r\nfrom submitting to it; and from the evidence of persons engaged in the\r\ntrade, it appears to be much more common than Mr. Cline seems to be\r\naware of.\r\n\r\n“_Cough and Asthma._--Chimney-sweepers are, from their being out at all\r\nhours and in all weathers, very liable to cough and inflammation of the\r\nchest.\r\n\r\n“_Burns._--They are very subject to burns, from their being forced\r\nup chimneys while on fire, or soon after they have been on fire, and\r\nwhile over-heated; and however they may cry out, their inhuman masters\r\npay not the least attention, but compel them, too often with horrid\r\nimprecations, to proceed.\r\n\r\n“_Stunted growth_, in this unfortunate race of the community, is\r\nattributed, in a great measure, to their being brought into the\r\nbusiness at a very early age.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo _accidents_ they were frequently liable in the pursuit of their\r\ncallings, and sometimes these accidents were the being jammed or fixed,\r\nor, as it was called in the trade, “stuck,” in narrow and heated flues,\r\nsometimes for hours, and until death.\r\n\r\nAmong these hapless lads were indeed many deaths from accidents,\r\ncruelty, privation, and exhaustion, but it does not appear that the\r\nnumber was ever ascertained. There were also many narrow escapes from\r\ndreadful deaths. I give instances of each:--\r\n\r\n“On Monday morning, the 29th of March, 1813, a chimney-sweeper of the\r\nname of Griggs, attended to sweep a small chimney in the brewhouse of\r\nMessrs. Calvert and Co., in Upper Thames-street; he was accompanied\r\nby one of his boys, a lad of about eight years of age, of the name of\r\nThomas Pitt. The fire had been lighted as early as two o’clock the\r\nsame morning, and was burning on the arrival of Griggs and his little\r\nboy at eight; the fire-place was small, and an iron pipe projected\r\nfrom the grate some little distance, into the flue; this the master\r\nwas acquainted with (having swept the chimneys in the brewhouse for\r\nsome years) and therefore had a tile or two taken from the roof,\r\nin order that the boy might descend the chimney. He had no sooner\r\nextinguished the fire than he suffered the lad to go down; and the\r\nconsequence, as might be expected, was his almost immediate death,\r\nin a state, no doubt, of inexpressible agony. The flue was of the\r\nnarrowest description, and must have retained heat sufficient to have\r\nprevented the child’s return to the top, even supposing he had not\r\napproached the pipe belonging to the grate, which must have been nearly\r\nred-hot; this, however, was not clearly ascertained on the inquest,\r\nthough the appearance of the body would induce an opinion that he had\r\nbeen unavoidably pressed against the pipe. Soon after his descent, the\r\nmaster, who remained on the top, was apprehensive that something had\r\nhappened, and therefore desired him to come up; the answer of the boy\r\nwas, ‘I cannot come up, master; I must die here.’ An alarm was given\r\nin the brewhouse, immediately, that he had stuck in the chimney, and a\r\nbricklayer who was at work near the spot attended, and after knocking\r\ndown part of the brickwork of the chimney, just above the fire-place,\r\nmade a hole sufficiently large to draw him through. A surgeon attended,\r\nbut all attempts to restore life were ineffectual. On inspecting the\r\nbody, various burns appeared; the fleshy part of the legs, and a great\r\npart of the feet more particularly, were injured; those parts, too, by\r\nwhich climbing boys most effectually ascend or descend chimneys, viz.,\r\nthe elbows and knees, seemed burnt to the bone; from which it must be\r\nevident that the unhappy sufferer made some attempts to return as soon\r\nas the horrors of his situation became apparent.”\r\n\r\n“In the improvement made some years since by the Bank of England, in\r\nLothbury, a chimney, belonging to a Mr. Mildrum, a baker, was taken\r\ndown, but before he began to bake, in order to see that the rest of\r\nthe flue was clear, a boy was sent up, and after remaining some time,\r\nand not answering to the call of his master, another boy was ordered\r\nto descend from the top of the flue and to meet him half-way; but this\r\nbeing found impracticable, they opened the brickwork in the lower\r\npart of the flue, and found the first-mentioned boy dead. In the mean\r\ntime the boy in the upper part of the flue called out for relief,\r\nsaying, he was completely jammed in the rubbish and was unable to\r\nextricate himself. Upon this a bricklayer was employed with the utmost\r\nexpedition, but he succeeded only in obtaining a lifeless body. The\r\nbodies were sent to St. Margaret’s Church, Lothbury, and a coroner’s\r\ninquest, which sat upon them, returned the verdict--Accidental Death.”\r\n\r\n“In the beginning of the year 1808, a chimney-sweeper’s boy being\r\nemployed to sweep a chimney in Marsh-street, Walthamstow, in the house\r\nof Mr. Jeffery, carpenter, unfortunately, in his attempt to get down,\r\nstuck in the flue and was unable to extricate himself. Mr. Jeffery,\r\nbeing within hearing of the boy, immediately procured assistance.\r\nAs the chimney was low, and the top of it easily accessible from\r\nwithout, the boy was taken out in about ten minutes, the chimney-pot\r\nand several rows of bricks having been previously removed; if he had\r\nremained in that dreadful situation many minutes longer, he must have\r\ndied. His master was sent for, and he arrived soon after the boy had\r\nbeen released; he abused him for the accident, and, after striking\r\nhim, sent him with a bag of soot to sweep another chimney. The child\r\nappeared so very weak when taken out that he could scarcely stand, and\r\nyet this wretched being, who had been up ever since three o’clock, had\r\nbefore been sent by his master to Wanstead, which with his walk to\r\nMarsh-street made about five miles.”\r\n\r\n“In May, 1817, a boy employed in sweeping a chimney in Sheffield\r\ngot wedged fast in one of the flues, and remained in that situation\r\nnear two hours before he could be extricated, which was at length\r\naccomplished by pulling down part of the chimney.”\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a child remained above two hours in some danger in a\r\nchimney, rather than venture down and encounter his master’s anger.\r\nThe man was held to bail, which he could not procure.\r\n\r\nAs in the cases I have described (at Messrs. Calvert’s, and in\r\nLothbury), the verdict was usually “Accidental Death,” or something\r\nequivalent.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise, however, where wilful cruelty was proven.\r\n\r\nThe following case was a subject of frequent comment at the time:--\r\n\r\n“On Friday, 31st May, 1816, William Moles and Sarah his wife, were\r\ntried at the Old Bailey for the wilful murder of John Hewley, alias\r\nHaseley, a boy about six years of age, in the month of April last, by\r\ncruelly beating him. Under the direction of the learned judge, they\r\nwere acquitted of the crime of murder, but the husband was detained to\r\ntake his trial as for a misdemeanor, of which he was convicted upon\r\nthe fullest evidence, and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. The\r\nfacts, as proved in this case, are too shocking in detail to relate:\r\nthe substance of them is, that he was forced up the chimney on the\r\nshoulder of a bigger boy, and afterwards violently pulled down again by\r\nthe leg and dashed upon a marble hearth; his leg was thus broken, and\r\ndeath ensued in a few hours, and on his body and knees were found scars\r\narising from wounds of a much older date.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis long-continued system of cruelties, of violations of public and\r\nprivate duties, bore and ripened its natural fruits. The climbing boys\r\ngrew up to be unhealthy, vicious, ignorant, and idle men, for during\r\ntheir apprenticeships their labour was over early in the day, and\r\nthey often passed away their leisure in gambling in the streets with\r\none another and other children of their stamp, as they frequently had\r\nhalfpence given to them. They played also at “chuck and toss” with\r\nthe journeymen, and of course were stripped of every farthing. Thus\r\nthey became indolent and fond of excitement. When a lad ceased to be\r\nan apprentice, although he might be but 16, he was too big to climb,\r\nand even if he got employment as a journeyman, his remuneration was\r\nwretched, only 2_s._ a week, with his board and lodging. There were,\r\nhowever, far fewer complaints of being insufficiently fed than might\r\nhave been expected, but the sleeping places were execrable: “They sleep\r\nin different places,” it was stated, “sometimes in sheds, and sometimes\r\nin places which we call barracks (large rooms), or in the cellar (where\r\nthe soot was kept); some never sleep upon anything that can be called a\r\nbed; some do.”\r\n\r\nMr. T. Allen, a master sweep for 22 years, gave the Committee the\r\nfollowing account of _the men’s earnings and_ (what may be called) _the\r\nGeneral Perquisites of the trade_ under the exploded system:--\r\n\r\n“If a man be 25 years of age, he has no more than 2_s._ a week; he\r\nis not clothed, only fed and lodged in the same manner as the boys.\r\nThe 2_s._ a week is not sufficient to find him clothes and other\r\nnecessaries, certainly not; it is hardly enough to find him with\r\nshoe-leather, for they walk over a deal of ground in going about the\r\nstreets. The journeyman is able to live upon those wages, for he gets\r\nhalfpence given him: supposing he is 16 or 20 years of age, he gets\r\nthe boys’ pence from them and keeps it; and if he happens to get a job\r\nfor which he receives a 1_s._, he gets 6_d._ of that, and his master\r\nthe other 6_d._ The boys’ pence are what the boys get after they\r\nhave been doing their master’s work; they get a 1_d._ or so, and the\r\njourneyman takes it from them, and ‘licks’ them if they do not give it\r\nup.” [These “jobs,” after the master’s work had been done, were chance\r\njobs, as when a journeyman on his round was called on by a stranger,\r\nand unexpectedly, to sweep a chimney. Sometimes, by arrangement of\r\nthe journeyman and the lad, the proceeds never reached the master’s\r\npocket. Sometimes, but rarely, such jobs were the journeyman’s rightful\r\nperquisite.] “Men,” proceeds Mr. Allen, “who are 22 and 23 years of\r\nage will play with the young boys and win their money. That is, they\r\nget half the money from them by force, and the rest by fraud. They are\r\ndriven to this course from the low wages which the masters give them,\r\nbecause they have no other means to get anything for themselves, not\r\neven the few necessaries which they may want; for even what they want\r\nto wash with they must get themselves. As to what becomes of the money\r\nthe boys get on May-day, when they are in want of clothes, the master\r\nwill buy them, as check shirts or handkerchiefs. These masters get a\r\nshare of the money which the boys collect on May-day. The boys have\r\nabout 1_s._ or 1_s._ 6_d._; the journeyman has also his share; then the\r\nmaster takes the remainder, which is to buy the boys’ clothes and other\r\nnecessaries, as they say. I cannot exactly tell what the average amount\r\nis that a boy will get on the May-day; the most that my boy ever got\r\nwas 5_s._ But I think that the boys get more than that; I should think\r\nthey get as much as 9_s._ or 10_s._ apiece. The Christmas-boxes are\r\ngenerally, I believe, divided among themselves (among the boys); but I\r\ncannot say rightly. It is spent in buying silk handkerchiefs, or Sunday\r\nshoes, I believe; but I am not perfectly sure.”\r\n\r\nOf the condition and lot of the operatives who were too big to go\r\nup chimneys, Mr. J. Fisher, a master-sweeper, gave the following\r\naccount:--“_They get into a roving way, and go about from one master to\r\nanother, and they often come to no good end at last_. They sometimes\r\ngo into the country, and after staying there some time, they come\r\nback again; I took a boy of that sort very lately and kept him like\r\nmy own, and let him go to school; he asked me one Sunday to let him\r\ngo to school, and I was glad to let him go, and I gave him leave; he\r\naccordingly went, and I have seen nothing of him since; before he went\r\nhe asked me if I would let him come home to see my child buried; I\r\ntold him to ask his school-master, but he did not come back again. I\r\ncannot tell what has become of him; he was to have served me for twelve\r\nmonths. I did not take him from the parish; he came to me. He said his\r\nparents were dead. _The effect of the roving habit of the large boys\r\nwhen they become too large to climb, is, that they get one with another\r\nand learn bad habits from one another; they never will stop long in any\r\none place._ They frequently go into the country and get various places;\r\nperhaps they stop a month at each; some try to get masters themselves,\r\nand some will get into bad company, which very often happens. _Then\r\nthey turn thieves, they get lazy, they won’t work, and people do not\r\nlike to employ them lest they should take anything out of their houses.\r\nThe generality of them never settle in any steady business._ They\r\ngenerally turn loose characters, and people will not employ them lest\r\nthey should take anything out of the house.”\r\n\r\nThe criminal annals of the kingdom bear out the foregoing account. Some\r\nof these boys, indeed, when they attained man’s estate, became, in a\r\ngreat measure, through their skill in climbing, expert and enterprising\r\nburglars, breaking into places where few men would have cared to\r\nventure. One of the most daring feats ever attempted and accomplished\r\nwas the escape from Newgate by a sweeper about 15 years ago. He climbed\r\nby the aid of his knees and elbows a height of nearly 80 feet, though\r\nthe walls, in the corner of the prison-yard, where this was done, were\r\nnearly of an even surface; the slightest slip could not have failed to\r\nhave precipitated the sweeper to the bottom. He was then under sentence\r\nof death for highway robbery.\r\n\r\n“His name was Whitehead, and he done a more wonderfuller thing nor\r\nthat,” remarked an informant, who had been his master. “We was sweeping\r\nthe bilers in a sugar-house, and he went from the biler up the flue of\r\nthe chimney, it was nearly as high as the Monument, that chimney; I\r\nshould say it was 30 or 40 feet higher nor the sugar-house. He got out\r\nat the top, and slid down the bare brickwork on the outside, on to the\r\nroof of the house, got through an attic window in the roof, and managed\r\nto get off without any one knowing what became of him. That was the\r\nmost wonderfullest thing I ever knowed in my life. I don’t know how\r\nhe escaped from being killed, but he was always an oudacious feller.\r\nIt was nearly three months after afore we found him in the country. I\r\ndon’t know where they sent him to after he was brought back to Newgate,\r\nbut I hear they made him a turnkey in a prison somewhere, and that he’s\r\ndoing very well now.” The feat at the sugar-house could be only to\r\nescape from his apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the whole Parliamentary evidence the sweepers, reared\r\nunder the old climbing system, are spoken of as a “short-lived” race,\r\nbut no statistics could be given. Some died old men in middle age, in\r\nthe workhouses. _Many were mere vagrants at the time of their death._\r\n\r\nI took the statement of a man who had been what he called a “climbing”\r\nin his childhood, but as he is now a master-sweeper, and has indeed\r\ngone through all grades of the business, I shall give it in my account\r\nof the present condition of the sweepers.\r\n\r\nClimbing is still occasionally resorted to, especially when repairs are\r\nrequired, “but the climbing boys,” I was told, “are now men.” These are\r\nslight dwarfish men, whose services are often in considerable request,\r\nand cannot at all times be commanded, as there are only about twenty\r\nof them in London, so effectually has climbing been suppressed. These\r\nlittle men, I was told, did pretty well, not unfrequently getting 2_s._\r\nor 2_s._ 6_d._ for a single job.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _labour question_, during the existence of the climbing\r\nboys, we find in the Report the following results:--\r\n\r\nThe _nominal_ wages to the journeymen were 2_s._ a week, with board and\r\nlodging. The apprentices received no wages, their masters being only\r\nrequired to feed, lodge, and clothe them.\r\n\r\nThe _actual_ wages were the same as the nominal, with the addition of\r\n1_s._ as perquisites in money. There were other perquisites in liquor\r\nor broken meat.\r\n\r\nIn the Reports are no accounts of the duration of labour throughout the\r\nyear, nor can I obtain from master-sweepers, who were in the business\r\nduring the old mode, any sufficient data upon which to found any\r\ncalculations. The employment, however, seems to have been generally\r\n_continuous_, running through the year, though in the course of the\r\ntwelvemonth one master would have four and another six different\r\njourneymen, but only one at a time. The vagrant propensities of the\r\nclass is a means of accounting for this.\r\n\r\nThe _nominal_ wages of those journeymen who resided in their own\r\napartments were generally 14_s._ a week, and their _actual_ about\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ extra in the form of perquisites. Others resided “on the\r\npremises,” having the care of the boys, with board and lodgings and\r\n5_s._ a week in money _nominally_, and 7_s._ 6_d._ _actually_, the\r\nperquisites being worth 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nConcerning the _general_ or average wages of the whole trade, I can\r\nonly present the following computation.\r\n\r\nMr. Tooke, in his evidence before the House of Commons, stated\r\nthat the Committee, of which he was a member, had ascertained that\r\none boy on an average swept about four chimneys daily, at prices\r\nvarying from 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._, or a medium return of about 10_d._\r\nper chimney, exclusive of the soot, then worth 8_d._ or 9_d._ a\r\nbushel. “It appears,” he said, “from a datum I have here, that those\r\nchimney-sweepers who keep six boys (the greatest number allowed by law)\r\ngain, on an average, nearly 270_l._; five boys, 225_l._; four boys,\r\n180_l._; three boys, 135_l._; two boys, 90_l._; and one boy 45_l._\r\n(yearly), exclusive of the soot, which is, I should suppose, upon an\r\naverage, from half a bushel to a bushel every time the chimney is\r\nswept.”\r\n\r\n“Out of the profits you mention,” he was then asked, “the master has to\r\nmaintain the boys?”--“Yes,” was the answer, “and when the expenses of\r\nhouse and cellar rent, and the wages of journeymen, and the maintenance\r\nof apprentices, are taken into the account, the number of master\r\nchimney-sweepers is not only more than the trade will support, but\r\nexceeds, by above one-third, what the public exigency requires. The\r\nCommittee also ascertained that the 200 master chimney-sweepers in the\r\nmetropolis were supposed to have in their employment 150 journeymen and\r\n500 boys.”\r\n\r\nThe matter may be reduced to a tabular form, expressing the amount in\r\nmoney--for it is not asserted that the masters generally gained on the\r\ncharge for their journeymen’s board and lodging--as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENDITURE OF MASTER CHIMNEY-SWEEPERS UNDER THE CLIMBING-BOY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n                                            Yearly.\r\n    20 journeymen at individual wages,\r\n  14_s._ each weekly                          £780\r\n    30 ditto, say 12_s._ weekly                936\r\n    100 ditto, 10_s._ ditto                  2,600\r\n    Board, Lodging, and Clothing of\r\n  500 boys, 4_s._ 6_d._ weekly               5,850\r\n    Rent, 20 large traders, 10_s._             520\r\n    Do. 30 others, 7_s._                       546\r\n    Do. 150 do., 3_s._ 6_d._                 1,365\r\n    20 horses (keep), 10_s._                   520\r\n    General wear and tear                      200\r\n                                           -------\r\n                                           £13,317\r\n\r\nIt appears that about 180 of the master chimney-sweepers were\r\nthemselves working men, in the same way as their journeymen.\r\n\r\nThe following, then, may be taken as the--\r\n\r\n\r\nYEARLY RECEIPTS OF THE MASTER SWEEPERS UNDER THE CLIMBING-BOY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n                                                Yearly.\r\n    Payment for sweeping 624,000\r\n  chimneys (4 daily, according to evidence\r\n  before Parliament, by each of\r\n  500 boys), 10_d._ per chimney, or yearly     £26,000\r\n\r\n    Soot (according to same account),\r\n  say 5_d._ per chimney                         13,000\r\n                                                ------\r\n                Total                          £39,000\r\n    Yearly expenditure                          13,317\r\n                                               -------\r\n                Yearly profit                  £25,683\r\n\r\nThis yielded, then, according to the information submitted to the\r\nHouse of Commons Select Committee, as the profits of the trade prior\r\nto 1817, an individual yearly gain to each master sweeper of 128_l._;\r\nbut, taking Mr. Tooke’s average yearly profit for the six classes of\r\ntradesmen, 270_l._, 225_l._, 180_l._, 135_l._, 90_l._, and 45_l._\r\nrespectively, the individual profit averages above 157_l._\r\n\r\nThe capital, I am informed, would not average above two guineas per\r\nmaster sweeper, nothing being wanted beyond a few common sacks, made by\r\nthe sweepers’ wives, and a few brushes. Only about 20 had horses, but\r\nbarrows were occasionally hired at a busy time.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing estimates I have not included any sums for apprentice\r\nfees, as I believe there would be something like a balance in the\r\nmatter, the masters sometimes paying parents such premiums for the use\r\nof their children as they received from the parishes for the _tuition_\r\nand maintenance of others.\r\n\r\nOf the _morals_, _education_, _religion_, _marriage_, &c., of sweepers,\r\nunder the two systems, I shall speak in another place.\r\n\r\nIt may be somewhat curious to conclude with a word of the extent of\r\nchimneys swept by a climbing boy. One respectable master-sweeper told\r\nme that for eleven years he had climbed five or six days weekly. During\r\nthis period he thought he had swept fifteen chimneys as a week’s\r\naverage, each chimney being at least 40 feet in height; so traversing,\r\nin ascending and descending, 686,400 feet, or 130 miles of a world of\r\nsoot. This, however, is little to what has been done by a climber of\r\n30 years’ standing, one of the little men of whom I have spoken. My\r\ninformant entertained no doubt that this man had, for the first 22\r\nyears of his career, climbed half as much again as he himself had; or\r\nhad traversed 2,059,200 feet of the interior of chimneys, or 390 miles.\r\nSince the new Act this man had of course climbed less, but had still\r\nbeen a good deal employed; so that, adding his progresses for the last\r\n9 years to the 22 preceding, he must have swept about 456 miles of\r\nchimney interiors.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPERS OF THE PRESENT DAY.\r\n\r\nThe chimney-sweepers of the present day are distinguished from those of\r\nold by the use of machines instead of climbing boys, for the purpose of\r\nremoving the soot from the flues of houses.\r\n\r\nThe chimney-sweeping machines were first used in this country in the\r\nyear 1803. They were the invention of Mr. Smart, a carpenter, residing\r\nat the foot of Westminster-bridge, Surrey. On the earlier trials of the\r\nmachine (which was similar to that used at present, and which I shall\r\nshortly describe), it was pronounced successful in 99 cases out of 100,\r\naccording to some accounts, but failing where sharp angles occurred in\r\nthe flue, which arrested its progress.\r\n\r\n“Means have been suggested,” said Mr. Tooke, formerly mentioned, in his\r\nevidence before a Committee of the House of Commons, “for obviating\r\nthat difficulty by fixed apparatus at the top of the flue with a\r\njack-chain and pulley, by which a brush could be worked up and down,\r\nor it could be done as is customary abroad, as I have repeatedly seen\r\nit at Petersburgh, and heard of its being done universally on the\r\nContinent, by letting down a bullet with a brush attached to it from\r\nthe top; but to obviate the inconvenience, which is considerable,\r\nfrom persons going upon the roof of a house, Mr. John White, junior,\r\nan eminent surveyor, has suggested the expediency of putting iron\r\nshutters or registers to each flue, in the roof or cockloft of each\r\nhouse; by opening which, and working the machine upwards and downwards,\r\nor letting down the bullet, which is the most compendious manner,\r\nthe chimney will be most effectually cleansed; and, by its aperture\r\nat bottom being kept well closed, it would be done with the least\r\npossible dirt and inconvenience to the family.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING CLIMBING SWEEPS.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe society for the supersedence of the labour of climbing boys\r\npromoted the adoption of the machines by all the means in their\r\npower, presenting the new instrument gratuitously to several master\r\nsweepers who were too poor to purchase it. Experiments were made\r\nand duly published as to the effectual manner in which the chimneys\r\nat Guildhall, the Mansion House, the then new Custom House, Dulwich\r\nCollege, and in other public edifices, had been cleansed by the\r\nmachine. But these statements seem to have produced little effect.\r\nPeople thought, perhaps, that the mechanical means which might very\r\nwell cleanse the chimneys of large public buildings--and it was said\r\nthat the chimneys of the Custom House were built with a view to the\r\nuse of the machine--might not be so serviceable for the same purposes\r\nin small private dwellings. Experiments continued to be made, often in\r\nthe presence of architects, of the more respectable sweepers, and of\r\nladies and gentlemen who took a philanthropic interest in the question,\r\nbetween the years 1803 and 1817, but with little influence upon the\r\ngeneral public, for in 1817 Mr. Smart supposed that there were but 50\r\nor 60 machines in general use in the metropolis, and those, it appeared\r\nfrom the evidence of several master sweepers, were used chiefly in\r\ngentlemen’s houses, many of those gentlemen having to be authoritative\r\nwith their servants, who, if not controlled, always preferred the\r\nservices of the climbing boys. Most servants had perquisites from the\r\nmaster sweepers, in the largest and most profitable ways of business,\r\nand they seemed to fear the loss of those perquisites if any change\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nThe opposition in Parliament, and in the general indifference of\r\nthe people, to the efforts of “the friends of the climbing boy” to\r\nsupersede his painful labours by the use of machinery, was formidable\r\nenough, but that of the servants appears to have been more formidable\r\nstill. Mr. Smart showed this in his explanations to the Committee.\r\nThe whole result of his experience was that servants set their faces\r\nagainst the introduction of the machine, grumbling if there were not\r\neven the appearance of dirt on the furniture after its use. “The first\r\nwinter I went out with this machine,” said Mr. Smart, “I went to Mr.\r\nBurke’s in Token-house Yard, who was a friend of mine, with a man to\r\nsweep the chimneys, and after waiting above an hour in a cold morning,\r\nthe housekeeper came down quite in a rage, that we should presume to\r\nring the bell or knock at the door; and when we got admittance, she\r\nswore she wished the machine and the inventor at the devil; she did\r\nnot know me. We swept all the chimneys, and when we had done I asked\r\nher what objection she had to it now; she said, a very serious one,\r\nthat if there was a thing by which a servant could get any emolument,\r\nsome d----d invention was sure to take it away from them, for that she\r\nreceived perquisites.”\r\n\r\nThis avowal of Mr. Burke’s housekeeper, as brusque as it was honest, is\r\ntypical of the feelings of the whole class of servants.\r\n\r\nThe opposition in Parliament, as I have intimated, continued. One noble\r\nlord informed the House of Peers that he had been indisposed of late\r\nand had sought the aid of calomel, the curative influence of which had\r\npervaded every portion of his frame; and that it as far surpassed the\r\nless searching powers of other medicines, as the brush of the climbing\r\nboy in cleansing every nook and corner of the chimney, surpassed all\r\nthe power of the machinery, which left the soot unpurged from those\r\nnooks and corners.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons, however, had expressed its conviction that as\r\nlong as master chimney-sweepers were permitted to employ climbing\r\nboys, the natural result of that permission would be the continuance\r\nof those miseries which the Legislature had sought, but which it had\r\nfailed, to put an end to; and they therefore recommended that the use\r\nof climbing boys should be prohibited altogether; and that the age at\r\nwhich the apprenticeship should commence should be extended from eight\r\nto fourteen, putting this trade upon the same footing as others which\r\ntook apprentices at that age.\r\n\r\nThis resolution became law in 1829. The employment of climbing boys in\r\nany manner in the interior of chimneys was prohibited under penalties\r\nof fine and imprisonment; and it was enacted that the new measure\r\nshould be carried into effect in three years, so giving the master\r\nsweepers that period of time to complete their arrangements. During the\r\ncourse of the experiments and inquiry, the sweepers, as a body, seem to\r\nhave thrown no obstacles, or very few and slight obstacles, in the way\r\nof the “Committee to promote the Superseding of the Labour of Climbing\r\nBoys;” while the most respectable of the class, or the majority of the\r\nrespectable, aided the efforts of the Committee.\r\n\r\nThis manifestation of public feeling probably modified the opposition\r\nof the sweepers, and unquestionably influenced the votes of members\r\nof Parliament. The change in the operations of the chimney-sweeping\r\nbusiness took place in 1832, as quietly and unnoticedly as if it were\r\nno change at all.\r\n\r\nThe machine now in use differs little from that invented by Mr. Smart,\r\nthe first introduced, but lighter materials are now used in its\r\nmanufacture. It has not been found necessary, however, to complicate\r\nits use with the jack-chain and pulley, and bullet with a brush\r\nattached, and the iron shutters or registers in the roof or cockloft,\r\nof which Mr. Tooke spoke.\r\n\r\nThe machine is formed of a series of hollow rods, made of a supple\r\ncane, bending and not breaking in any sinuosity of the flues. This\r\ncane is made of the same material as gentlemen’s walking-sticks. The\r\nfirst machines were made of wood, and were liable to be broken; and\r\nto enable the sweeps on such occasions to recover the broken part, a\r\nstrong line ran from bottom to top through the centre of the sticks,\r\nwhich were bored for the purpose, and strung on this cord. The cane\r\nmachine, however, speedily and effectually superseded these imperfect\r\ninstruments; and there are now none of them to be met with. To the\r\ntop tube of the machine is attached the “brush,” called technically\r\n“the head,” of elastic whalebone spikes, which “give” and bend, in\r\naccordance with the up or down motion communicated by the man working\r\nthe machine, so sweeping what was described to me as “both ways,” up\r\nand down.\r\n\r\nSome of these rods, which fit into one another by means of brass\r\nscrews, are 4 feet 6 inches long, and diminish in diameter to suit\r\ntheir adjustment. Some rods are but 3 feet 6 inches long, and 4 feet is\r\nthe full average length; while the average price at the machine maker’s\r\nis 2_s._ 6_d._ a rod, if bought separately. The head costs 10_s._,\r\non an average, if bought separately. It is seldom that a machine is\r\nrequired to number beyond 17 rods (extending 68 feet), and the better\r\nclass of sweepers are generally provided with 17 rods. The cost of the\r\nentire machine, for every kind of chimney-work, when purchased new, as\r\na whole, is, when of good quality, from 30_s._ to 5_l._, according to\r\nthe number of rods, duplicate rods, &c. Mr. Smart stated, in 1817, that\r\nthe average price of one of his machines was then 2_l._ 3_s._\r\n\r\nThe sweepers who labour chiefly in the poorer localities--and several\r\ntold me how indifferent many people in those parts were as to their\r\nchimneys being swept at all--rarely use a machine to extend beyond 40\r\nfeet, or one composed of 10 or 11 rods; but some of the inferior class\r\nof sweepers buy of those in a superior way of trade worn machines, at\r\nfrom a third to a half of the prime cost. These machines they trim up\r\nthemselves. One portion of the work, however, they cannot repair or\r\nrenew--the broken or worn-out brass screws of the rods, which they call\r\nthe “ferules.” These, when new, are 1_s._ each. There were, when the\r\nmachine-work was novel, I was informed, street-artizans who went about\r\nrepairing these screws or ferules; but their work did not please the\r\nchimney-sweepers, and this street-trade did not last above a year or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThe rods of the machine, when carefully attended to, last a long time.\r\nOne man told me that he was still working some rods which he had worked\r\nsince 1842 (nine years), with occasional renewal of the ferules. The\r\nhead is either injured or worn down in about two years; if not well\r\nmade at first, in a year. The diameter of this head or brush is, on the\r\naverage, 18 inches. One of my informants had himself swept a chimney\r\nof 80 feet, and one of his fellow-workers had said that he once swept\r\na chimney of 120 feet high; in both cases by means of the machine.\r\nMy informant, however, thought such a feat as the 120-feet sweep was\r\nhardly possible, as only one man’s strength can be applied to the\r\nmachine; and he was of opinion that no man’s muscular powers would be\r\nsufficient to work a machine at a height of 120 feet. The labour is\r\nsometimes very severe; “enough,” one strongly-built man told me, “to\r\nmake your arms, head, and heart ache.”\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned chimneys are generally 12 by 14 inches in their\r\ndimensions in the interior; and for the thorough sweeping of such\r\nchimneys--the opinion of all the sweepers I saw according on the\r\nsubject--a head (it is rarely called brush in the trade) of 18 inches\r\ndiameter is insufficient, yet they are seldom used larger. One\r\nintelligent master sweeper, speaking from his own knowledge, told\r\nme that in the neighbourhood where he worked numbers of houses had\r\nbeen built since the introduction of the machines, and the chimneys\r\nwere only 9 inches square, as regards the interior; the smaller\r\nflues are sometimes but 7. These 9-inch chimneys, he told me, were\r\nfrequent in “scamped” houses, houses got up at the lowest possible\r\nrate by speculating builders. This was done because the brickwork\r\nof the chimneys costs more than the other portions of the masonry,\r\nand so the smaller the dimensions of the chimneys the less the cost\r\nof the edifice. The machines are sometimes as much crippled in this\r\ncircumscribed space as they are found of insufficient dimensions in\r\nthe old-fashioned chimneys; and so the “scamped” chimney, unless by a\r\nmaster having many “heads,” is not so cleanly swept as it might be.\r\nChimneys not built in this manner are now usually 9 inches by 14.\r\n\r\nIn cleansing a chimney with the machine the sweep stands by, or rather\r\nin, the fire-place, having first attached a sort of curtain to the\r\nmantle to confine the soot to one spot, the operator standing inside\r\nthis curtain. He first introduces the “head,” attached to its proper\r\nrod, into the chimney, “driving” it forward, then screws on the next\r\nrod, and so on, until the head has been driven to the top of the\r\nchimney. The soot which has fallen upon the hearth, within the curtain,\r\nis collected into a sack or sacks, and is carried away on the men’s\r\nbacks, and occasionally in carts. The whalebone spikes of the head are\r\nmade to extend in every direction, so that when it is moved no part\r\nof the chimney, if the surface be even, escapes contact with these\r\nspikes, if the work be carefully done, as indeed it generally is; for\r\nthe cleaner the chimney is swept of course the greater amount of soot\r\nadds to the profit of the sweeper. One man told me that he thought\r\nhe had seen in some old big chimneys, a long time unswept, more soot\r\nbrought down by the machine than, under similar circumstances as to the\r\ntime the chimney had remained uncleansed, would have been done by the\r\nclimbing boy.\r\n\r\nAll the master sweepers I saw concurred in the opinion that the\r\nmachine was _not_ in all respects so effective a sweeper as the\r\nclimbing boy, as it does not reach the recesses, nooks, crannies, or\r\nholes in the chimney, where the soot remains little disturbed by the\r\npresent process. This want is felt the most in the cleansing of the\r\nold-fashioned chimneys, especially in the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Cook, in 1817, stated to the Committee that the cleansing of a\r\nchimney by a boy or by a machine occupied the same space of time; but I\r\nfind the general opinion of the sweepers now to be that it is only the\r\nsmall and straight chimneys which can be swept with as great celerity\r\nby a machine as by a climber; in all others the lad was quicker by\r\nabout 5 minutes in 30, or in that proportion.\r\n\r\nI heard sweepers represent that the passing of the Act of Parliament\r\nnot only deprived them in many instances of the unexpired term of a\r\nboy’s apprenticeship in his services as a climber, but “threw open\r\nthe business to any one.” The business, however, it seems, was always\r\n“open to any one.” There was no art nor mystery in it, as regarded\r\nthe functions of the master; any one could send a boy up a chimney,\r\nand collect and carry away the soot he brought down, quite as readily\r\nand far more easily than he can work a machine. Nevertheless, men\r\nunder the old system could hardly (and some say they were forbidden\r\nto) embark in this trade unless they had been apprenticed to it; for\r\nthey were at a loss how to possess themselves of climbing boys, and\r\nhow to make a connection. When the machines were introduced, however,\r\na good many persons who were able to “raise the price” of one started\r\nin the line on their own account. These men have been called by the\r\nold hands “leeks” or “green ’uns,” to distinguish them from the\r\nregularly-trained men, who pride themselves not a little on the fact\r\nof their having served seven or eight years, “duly and truly,” as they\r\nnever fail to express it. This increase of fresh hands tended to lower\r\nthe earnings of the class; and some masters, who were described to\r\nme as formerly very “comfortable,” and some, comparatively speaking,\r\nrich, were considerably reduced by it. The number of “leeks” in 1832\r\nI heard stated, with the exaggeration to which I have been accustomed\r\nwhen uninformed men, ignorant of the relative value of numbers, have\r\nexpressed their opinions, as 1000!\r\n\r\nThe several classes in the chimney-sweeping trade may be arranged as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nThe _Master Chimney-Sweepers_, called sometimes “Governors” by the\r\njourneymen, are divisible into three kinds:--\r\n\r\nThe “large” or “high masters,” who employ from 2 to 10 men and 2 boys,\r\nand keep sometimes 2 horses and a cart, not particularly for the\r\nconveyance of the soot, but to go into the country to a gentleman’s\r\nhouse to fulfil orders.\r\n\r\nThe “small” or “low masters,” who employ, on an average, two men, and\r\nsometimes but one man and a boy, without either horse or cart.\r\n\r\nThe “single-handed master-men,” who employ neither men nor boys, but do\r\nall the work themselves.\r\n\r\nOf these three classes of masters there are two subdivisions.\r\n\r\nThe “leeks” or “green-uns,” that is to say, those who have not\r\nregularly served their time to the trade.\r\n\r\nThe “knullers” or “queriers,” that is to say, those who solicit custom\r\nin an irregular manner, by knocking at the doors of houses and such\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nOf the competition of capitalists in this trade there are, I am told,\r\nno instances. “We have our own stations,” one master sweeper said, “and\r\nif I contract to sweep a genelman’s house, here in Pancras, for 25_s._\r\na year, or 10_s._, or anythink, my nearest neighbour, as has men and\r\nmachines fit, is in Marrybun; and it wouldn’t pay to send his men a\r\nmile and a half, or on to two mile, and work at what I can--let alone\r\nless. No, sir, I’ve known bisness nigh 20 year, and there’s nothink in\r\nthe way of that underworking. The poor creeturs as keeps theirselves\r\nwith a machine, and nothing to give them a lift beyond it, _they’d_\r\nundertake work at any figure, but nobody employs or can trust to them,\r\nbut on chance.” The contracts, I am told, for a year’s chimney-sweeping\r\nin any mansion are on the same terms with one master as with another.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _Journeymen Chimney-Sweepers_ there are also three\r\nkinds:--\r\n\r\nThe “foreman” or “first journeyman” sweeper, who accompanies the men to\r\ntheir work, superintends their labours, and receives the money, when\r\npaid immediately after sweeping.\r\n\r\nThe “journeyman” sweeper, whose duty it is to work the machine, and\r\n(where no under-journeyman, or boy, is kept) to carry the machine and\r\ntake home the soot.\r\n\r\nThe “under-journeyman” or “boy,” who has to carry the machine, take\r\nhome the soot, and work the machine up the lower-class flues.\r\n\r\nThere are, besides these, some 20 climbing men, who ascend such flues\r\nas the machines cannot cleanse effectually, and, it must, I regret to\r\nsay, be added, some 20 to 30 climbing boys, mostly under eleven years\r\nof age, who are still used for the same purpose “on the sly.” Many of\r\nthe masters, indeed, lament the change to machine-sweeping, saying that\r\ntheir children, who are now useless, would, in “the good old times,”\r\nhave been worth a pound a week to them. It is in the suburbs that these\r\nclimbing children are mostly employed.\r\n\r\nThe _hours of labour_ are from the earliest morning till about midday,\r\nand sometimes later.\r\n\r\nThere are _no Houses of Call_, trade societies, or regulations among\r\nthese operatives, but there are low public-houses to which they resort,\r\nand where they can always be heard of.\r\n\r\nWhen a chimney-sweeper is out of work he merely inquires of others in\r\nthe same line of business, who, if they know of any one that wants a\r\njourneyman, direct their brother sweeper to call and see the master;\r\nbut though the chimney-sweepers have no trade societies, some of the\r\nbetter class belong to sick, and others to burial, funds. The lower\r\nclass of sweepers, however, seem to have no resource in sickness, or in\r\ntheir utmost need, but the parish. There are sweepers, I am told, in\r\nevery workhouse in London.\r\n\r\nThere are three _modes of payment common_ among the sweepers:--\r\n\r\n  1, in money;\r\n  2, partly in money and partly in kind; and\r\n  3, by perquisites.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the masters pay the men they employ from 2_s._ to\r\n3_s._, and a few 4_s._ and 6_s._ per week, together with their board\r\nand lodging. It may seem that 3_s._ per week is a small sum, but it was\r\nremarked to me that there are few working men who, after supporting\r\nthemselves, are able to save that sum weekly, while the sweepers\r\nhave many perquisites of one sort or other, which sometimes bring\r\nthem in 1_s._, 2_s._, 3_s._, 4_s._, and occasionally 5_s._ or 6_s._,\r\na week additional--a sufficient sum to pay for clothes and washing.\r\nThe journeymen, when lodged in the house of the master, are single\r\nmen, and if constantly employed might, perhaps, do well, but they are\r\noften unemployed, especially in the summer, when there are not so many\r\nfires kept burning. As soon as one of them gets married, or what among\r\nthem is synonymous, “takes up with a woman,” which they commonly do\r\nwhen they are able to purchase some sort of a machine, they set up\r\nfor themselves, and thus a great number of the men get to be masters\r\non their own account, without being able to employ any extra hands.\r\nThese are generally reckoned among the “knullers;” they do but little\r\nbusiness at first, for the masters long established in a neighbourhood,\r\nwho are known to the people, and have some standing, are almost always\r\npreferred to those who are strangers or mere beginners.\r\n\r\nIt was very common, but perhaps more common in country towns than in\r\nLondon, for the journeymen, as well as apprentices, in this and many\r\nother trades to live at the master’s table. But the board and lodging\r\nsupplied, in lieu of money-wages, to the journeymen sweepers, seems\r\nto be one of the few existing instances of such a practice in London.\r\nAmong slop-working tailors and shoemakers, some unfortunate workmen are\r\nboarded and lodged by their employers, but these employers are merely\r\nmiddlemen, who gain their living by serving such masters as “do not\r\nlike to drive their negroes themselves.” But among the sweepers there\r\nare no middlemen.\r\n\r\nIt is not all the journeymen sweepers, however, who are remunerated\r\nafter this manner, for many receive 12_s._, and some 14_s._, and not a\r\nfew 18_s._ weekly, besides perquisites, but reside at their own homes.\r\n\r\n_Apprenticeship_ is now not at all common among the sweepers, as no\r\ntraining to the business is needed. Lord Shaftesbury, however, in\r\nJuly last, gave notice of his intention to bring in a bill to prevent\r\npersons who had not been duly apprenticed to the business establishing\r\nthemselves as sweepers.\r\n\r\n_The Perquisites_ of the journeymen sweepers are for measuring,\r\narranging, and putting the soot sold into the purchasers’ sacks,\r\nor carts; for this is considered extra work. The payment of this\r\nperquisite seems to be on no fixed scale, some having 1_s._ for 50,\r\nand some for 100 bushels. When a chimney is on fire and a journeyman\r\nsweeper is employed to extinguish it, he receives from 1_s._ 6_d._\r\nto 5_s._ according to the extent of time consumed and the risk of\r\nbeing injured. “Chance sweeping,” or the sweeping of a chimney not\r\nbelonging to a customer, when a journeyman has completed his regular\r\nround, ensures him 3_d._ in some employments, but in fewer than was\r\nonce the case. The beer-money given by any customer to a journeyman is\r\nalso his perquisite. Where a foreman is kept, the “brieze,” or cinders\r\ncollected from the grate, belong to him, and the ashes belong to the\r\njourneyman; but where there is no foreman, the brieze and ashes belong\r\nto the journeyman solely. These they sell to the poor at the rate of\r\n6_d._ a bushel. I am told by experienced men that, all these matters\r\nconsidered, it may be stated that one-half of the journeymen in London\r\nhave perquisites of 1_s._ 6_d._, the other half of 2_s._ 6_d._ a week.\r\n\r\n_The Nominal Wages_ to the journeymen, then, are from 12_s._ to 18_s._\r\nweekly, without board and lodging, or from 2_s._ to 6_s._ in money,\r\nwith board and lodging, represented as equal to 7_s._\r\n\r\n_The Actual Wages_ are 2_s._ 6_d._ a week more in the form of\r\nperquisites, and perhaps 4_d._ daily in beer or gin.\r\n\r\nThe wages to the boys are mostly 1_s._ a week, but many masters pay\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._, with board and lodging. These boys have no\r\nperquisites, except such bits of broken victuals as are given to them\r\nat houses where they go to sweep.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the foreman are generally 18_s._ per week, but some\r\nreceive 14_s._ and some 20_s._ without board and lodging. In one case,\r\nwhere the foreman is kept by the master, only 2_s._ 6_d._ in money is\r\ngiven to him weekly. The perquisites of these men average from 4_s._ to\r\n5_s._ a week.\r\n\r\n_The work in the chimney-sweeping trade is more regular than might\r\nat first be supposed._ The sweepers whose circumstances enable them\r\nto employ journeymen send them on regular rounds, and do not engage\r\n“chance” hands. If business is brisk, the men and the master, when a\r\nworking man himself, work later than ordinary, and sometimes another\r\nhand is put on and paid the customary amount, by the week, until the\r\nbriskness ceases; but this is a rare occurrence. There are, however,\r\nstrong lads, or journeymen out of work, who are _occasionally_ employed\r\nin “_jobbing_,” helping to carry the soot and such like.\r\n\r\nThe labour of the journeymen, as regards the payment by their masters,\r\nis _continuous_, but the men are often discharged for drunkenness,\r\nor for endeavouring to “form a connection of their own” among their\r\nemployers’ customers, and new hands are then put on. “Chimneys won’t\r\nwait, you know, sir,” was said to me, “and if I quit a hand this week,\r\nthere’s another in his place next. If I discharge a hand for three\r\nmonths in a slack time, I have two on when it’s a busy time.” Perhaps\r\nthe average employment of the whole body of operatives may be taken\r\nat nine months’ work in the year. When out of employment the chief\r\nresource of these men is in night-work; some turn street-sellers and\r\nbricklayers’ labourers.\r\n\r\nI am told that a considerable sum of money was left for the purpose\r\nof supplying every climbing-boy who called on the first of May at\r\na certain place, with a shilling and some refreshment, but I have\r\nnot been able to ascertain by whom it was left, or where it was\r\ndistributed; none of the sweepers with whom I conversed knew anything\r\nabout it. I also heard, that since the passing of the Act, the money\r\nhas been invested in some securities or other, and is now accumulating,\r\nbut to what purpose it is intended to be applied I have no means of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to estimate the gross yearly income of the\r\noperative sweepers.\r\n\r\nThere are, then, 399 men employed as journeymen, and of them 147\r\nreceive a money wage weekly from their masters, and reside with their\r\nparents or at their own places. The remaining 252 are boarded and\r\nlodged. This board and lodging are generally computed, as under the\r\nold system, to represent 8_s._, being 1_s._ a day for board and 1_s._\r\na week for lodging. But, on the average, the board does not cost the\r\nmasters 7_s._ a week, but, as I shall afterwards show, barely 6_s._\r\n\r\nThe men and boys may be said to be all fully employed for nine months\r\nin the year; some, of course, are at work all the year through, but\r\nothers get only six months’ employment in the twelve months; so that\r\ntaking nine months as the average, we have the following table of\r\n\r\n\r\nWAGES PAID TO THE OPERATIVE SWEEPERS OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------+-------------+------------\r\n

         Grand Total                    10,465 0  11\r\n\r\nThus we find that the _constant_ or _average casual_ wages of the\r\nseveral classes of operative chimney-sweepers may be taken as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Journeymen without board and lodging,  _s._  _d._\r\n  and with perquisites averaging 2_s._\r\n  a week                                    12     6\r\n    Journeymen with board and lodging\r\n  and 2_s._ a week perquisites               9    10-1/2\r\n    Foreman, without board and lodging,\r\n  at 2_s._ 6_d._ a week perquisites         15     7\r\n    Boys, with board and lodging             5     3\r\n\r\nThe _general_ wages of the trade, including foreman, journeymen, and\r\nboys, and calculating the perquisites to average 2_s._ weekly, will be\r\n10_s._ 6_d._ a week, the same as the cotton factory operatives.\r\n\r\nBut if 10,500_l._ be the income of the operatives, what do the\r\nemployers receive who have to pay this sum?\r\n\r\nThe charge for sweeping one of the lofty chimneys in the public and\r\nofficial edifices, and in the great houses in the aristocratic streets\r\nand squares, is 2_s._ 6_d._ and 3_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nThe chimneys of moderate-sized houses are swept at 1_s._ to 1_s._ 6_d._\r\neach, and those of the poorer classes are charged generally 6_d._;\r\nsome, however, are swept at 3_d._ and 4_d._; and when soot realized\r\na higher price (some of the present master sweepers _have_ sold it\r\nat 1_s._ a bushel), the chimneys of poor persons were swept by the\r\npoorer class of sweeps merely for the perquisite of the soot. This is\r\nsometimes done even now, but to a very small extent, by a sweeper, “on\r\nhis own hook,” and in want of a job, but generally with an injunction\r\nto the person whose chimney has been cleansed on such easy terms, not\r\nto mention it, as it “couldn’t be made a practice on.”\r\n\r\nEstimating the number of houses belonging to the wealthy classes of\r\nsociety to be 54,000, and these to be swept eight times a year, and\r\nthe charge for sweeping to be 2_s._ 6_d._ each time; and the number of\r\nhouses belonging to the middle classes to be 90,000, and each to be\r\nswept four times a year, at 1_s._ 6_d._ each time; and the dwellings of\r\nthe poor and labouring classes to be swept once a year at 6_d._ each\r\ntime, and the number of such dwellings to be 165,000, we find that the\r\ntotal sum paid to the master chimney-sweepers of London is, in round\r\nnumbers, 85,000_l._\r\n\r\nThe sum obtained for 800,000 bushels of soot collected by the\r\nmaster-sweepers from the houses of London, at 5_d._ per bushel, is\r\n16,500_l._\r\n\r\nThus the total annual income of the master-sweepers of London is\r\n100,000_l._\r\n\r\nOut of this 100,000_l._ per annum, the expenses of the masters would\r\nappear to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yearly Expenditure of the Master-Sweepers._\r\n\r\n    Sum paid in wages to 473 journeymen       £10,500\r\n    Rent, &c., of 350 houses or lodgings,\r\n  at 12_l._ yearly each                         4,200\r\n    Wear and tear of 1000 machines,\r\n  1_l._ each yearly                             1,000\r\n    Ditto 2000 sacks, at 1_s._ each yearly        100\r\n    Keep of 25 horses, 7_s._ weekly each          455\r\n    Wear and tear of 25 carts and harness,\r\n  1_l._ each                                       25\r\n    Interest on capital at 10 per cent.           450\r\n                                               ------\r\n    Total yearly expenditure of\r\n  master-sweepers employing journeymen        £16,736\r\n\r\nThe rent here given may seem low at 12_l._ a year, but many of\r\nthe chimney-sweepers live in parlours, with cellars below, in old\r\nout-of-the-way places, at a low rental, in Stepney, Shadwell, Wapping,\r\nBethnal-green, Hoxton, Lock’s-fields, Walworth, Newington, Islington,\r\nSomers-town, Paddington, &c. The better sort of master-sweepers at the\r\nWest-end often live in a mews.\r\n\r\nThe gains, then, of the master sweepers are as under:--\r\n\r\n    Annual income for cleansing chimneys\r\n  and soot                                    £100,000\r\n    Expenditure for wages, rent, wear,\r\n  and tear, keep of horses, &c., say            20,000\r\n                                               -------\r\n  Annual profit of master chimney-sweepers\r\n  of London                                    £80,000\r\n\r\nThis amount of profit, divided among 350 masters, gives about 230_l._\r\nper annum to each individual; it is only by a few, however, that such\r\na sum is realized, as in the 100,000_l._ paid by the London public\r\nto the sweepers’ trade, is included the sum received by the men who\r\nwork single-handed, “on their own hook,” as they say, employing\r\nno journeymen. Of these men’s earnings, the accounts I heard from\r\nthemselves and the other master sweepers were all accordant, that they\r\nbarely made journeymen’s wages. They have the very worst-paid portion\r\nof the trade, receiving neither for their sweeping nor their soot the\r\nprices obtained by the better masters; indeed they very frequently sell\r\ntheir soot to their more prosperous brethren. Their general statement\r\nis, that they make “eighteen pence a day, and all told.” Their receipts\r\nthen, and they have no perquisites as have the journeymen, are, in a\r\nslack time, about 1_s._ a day (and some days they do not get a job);\r\nbut in the winter they are busier, as it is then that sweepers are\r\nemployed by the poor; and at that period the “master-men” may make from\r\n15_s._ to 20_s._ a week each; so that, I am assured, the average of\r\ntheir weekly takings may be estimated at 12_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nNow, deducting the expenditure from the receipts of 100,000_l._ (for\r\nsweeping and soot), the balance, as we have seen, is 80,000_l._, an\r\namount of profit which, if equally divided among the three classes of\r\nthe trade, will give the following sums:--\r\n\r\n                                  Yearly, each.    Yearly, total.\r\n\r\n    Profits of 150 single-handed     £    _s._           £\r\n  master-men                        32    10           4,940\r\n    Do. 92 small masters           200     0          18,400\r\n    Do. 106 large masters          500     0          53,000\r\n                                                      ------\r\n                                                     £76,340\r\n\r\nNor is this estimate of the masters’ profits, I am assured,\r\nextravagant. One of the smaller sweepers, but a prosperous man in his\r\nway, told me that he knew a master sweeper who was “as rich as Crœser,\r\nhad bought houses, and could not write his own name.”\r\n\r\nWe have now but to estimate the amount of capital invested in the\r\nchimney-sweepers’ trade, and then to proceed to the characteristics of\r\nthe men.\r\n\r\n    1200 machines, 2_l._ 10_s._ each (present    £\r\n  average value)                               3000\r\n    3000 sacks, 2_s._ 6_d._ each                385\r\n    25 horses, 20_l._ each                      500\r\n    25 sets of harness, 2_l._ each               50\r\n    25 carts, 12_l._ each                       300\r\n                                              -----\r\n                                              £4235\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that the sweepers will require the services of more\r\nthan 25 horses, but I am assured that such is not the case as regards\r\nthe soot business, for the soot is carted away from the sweepers’\r\npremises by the farmer or other purchaser.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, then, that the facts of the chimney-sweepers’ trade\r\nare briefly as under:--\r\n\r\nThe gross quantity of soot collected yearly throughout London is\r\n800,000 bushels. The value of this, sold as manure, at 5_d._ per\r\nbushel, is 16,500_l._\r\n\r\nThere are 800 to 900 people employed in the trade, 200 of whom are\r\nmasters employing journeymen, 150 single-handed master-men, and 470\r\njourneymen and under journeymen.\r\n\r\nThe annual income of the entire number of journeymen is 10,500_l._\r\nwithout perquisites, or 13,000_l._ with, which gives an average weekly\r\nwage to the operatives of 10_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nThe annual income of the masters and leeks is, for sweeping and soot,\r\n100,000_l._\r\n\r\nThe annual expenditure of the masters for rent, keep of horses, wear\r\nand tear, and wages, is 20,000_l._\r\n\r\nThe gross annual profit of the 350 masters is 80,000_l._, which is\r\nat the rate of about 35_l._ per annum to each of the single-handed\r\nmen, 200_l._ to each of the smaller masters employing journeymen, and\r\n500_l._ to each of the larger masters.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the trade is about 5000_l._\r\n\r\n_The price charged_ by the “high master sweepers” for cleaning the\r\nflues of a house rented at 150_l._ a year and upwards, is from 1_s._ to\r\n3_s._ 6_d._ (the higher price being paid for sweeping those chimneys\r\nwhich have a hot plate affixed). A small master, on the other hand,\r\nwill charge from 1_s._ to 3_s._ for the same kind of work, while\r\na single-handed man seldom gets above “a 2_s._ job,” and that not\r\nvery often. The charge for sweeping the flues of a house rented at\r\nfrom 50_l._ to 150_l._ a year, is from 9_d._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ by a\r\nlarge master, and from 8_d._ to 2_s._ by a small master, while a\r\nsingle-handed man will take the job at from 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ The\r\nprice charged per flue for a house rented at from 20_l._ a year up to\r\n50_l._ a year, will average 6_d._ a flue, charged by large masters,\r\n4_d._ by small masters, and from 2_d._ to 3_d._ by the single-handed\r\nsweepers in some cases; indeed, the poorest class will sweep a flue for\r\nthe soot only. But the prices charged for sweeping chimneys differ in\r\nthe different parts of the metropolis. I subjoin a list of the maximum\r\nand minimum charge for the several districts.\r\n\r\n                                            _d._ _s._ _d._\r\n  Kensington and Hammersmith                 4 to 3    0\r\n  Westminster                                3 „  2    0\r\n  Chelsea                                    4 „  2    6\r\n  St. George’s, Hanover-sq.                  6 „  3    6\r\n  St. Martin’s and St. Ann’s                 4 „  2    6\r\n  St. James’s, Westminster                   3 „  2    6\r\n  Marylebone                                 4 „  2    6\r\n  Paddington                                 3 „  2    0\r\n  Hampstead                                  3 „  1    6\r\n  St. Pancras                                4 „  3    0\r\n  Islington                                  3 „  1    6\r\n  Hackney and Homerton                       3 „  2    0\r\n  St. Giles’s and St. George’s, Bloomsbury   3 „  3    0\r\n  Strand                                     4 „  2    6\r\n  Holborn                                    4 „  2    6\r\n  Clerkenwell                                3 „  1    6\r\n  St. Luke’s                                 3 „  1    0\r\n  East London                                3 „  1    6\r\n  West London                                4 „  2    6\r\n  London City                                6 „  2    6\r\n  Shoreditch                                 3 „  1    0\r\n  Bethnal Green                              3 „  1    0\r\n  Whitechapel                                4 „  1    6\r\n  St. George’s in the East and Limehouse     3 „  1    0\r\n  Stepney                                    3 „  1    6\r\n  Poplar                                     4 „  2    0\r\n  St. George’s, St. Olave’s, and St.\r\n    Saviour’s, Southwark                     3 „  1    6\r\n  Bermondsey                                 3 „  0    9\r\n  Walworth and Newington                     4 „  1    6\r\n  Wandsworth                                 4 „  1    6\r\n  Lambeth                                    3 „  1    0\r\n  Camberwell                                 4 „  2    0\r\n  Clapham, Brixton, and Tooting              4 „  2    6\r\n  Rotherhithe                                3 „  1    6\r\n  Greenwich                                  3 „  1    6\r\n  Woolwich                                   3 „  2    6\r\n  Lewisham                                   6 „  3    0\r\n\r\n  N.B.--The single-handed and the knullers generally\r\n  charge a penny less than the prices above given.\r\n\r\n_There are three different kinds of soot_:--the best is produced purely\r\nfrom coal; the next in value is that which proceeds from the combustion\r\nof vegetable refuse along with the coal, as in cases where potato\r\npeelings, cabbage leaves, and the like, are burnt in the fires of the\r\npoorer classes; while the soot produced from wood fires is, I am told,\r\nscarcely worth carriage. Wood-soot, however, is generally mixed with\r\nthat from coal, and sold as the superior kind.\r\n\r\nNot only is there a difference in value in the various kinds of soot,\r\nbut there is also a vast difference in the weight. A bushel of pure\r\ncoal soot will not weigh above four pounds; that produced from the\r\ncombustion of coal and vegetable refuse will weigh nearly thrice as\r\nmuch; while that from wood fires is, I am assured, nearly ten times\r\nheavier than from coal.\r\n\r\nI have not heard that the introduction of free trade has had any\r\ninfluence on the value of soot, or in reducing the wages of the\r\noperatives. The same wages are paid to the operatives whether soot\r\nsells at a high or low price.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WORKING CHIMNEY-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why the chimney-sweepers have ever been a\r\ndistinct and peculiar class. They have long been looked down upon\r\nas the lowest order of workers, and treated with contumely by those\r\nwho were but little better than themselves. The peculiar nature of\r\ntheir work giving them not only a filthy appearance, but an offensive\r\nsmell, of itself, in a manner, prohibited them from associating with\r\nother working men; and the natural effect of such proscription\r\nhas been to compel them to herd together apart from others, and to\r\nacquire habits and peculiarities of their own widely differing from the\r\ncharacteristics of the rest of the labouring classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TABLE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF MASTER CHIMNEY SWEEPERS RESIDING IN\r\nTHE SEVERAL DISTRICTS OF THE METROPOLIS, THE NUMBER OF FOREMEN, OF\r\nJOURNEYMEN,

Under Journeymen employed, and\r\n the Wages received by each, as well as the quantity of soot collected,\r\n have been likewise obtained; but the names of the masters are here\r\n omitted for want of space, and the results alone are given.\r\n\r\nSweepers, however, have not from this cause generally been an\r\nhereditary race--that is, they have not become sweepers from father\r\nto son for many generations. Their numbers were, in the days of the\r\nclimbing boys, in most instances increased by parish apprentices, the\r\nparishes usually adopting that mode as the cheapest and easiest of\r\nfreeing themselves from a part of the burden of juvenile pauperism. The\r\nclimbing boys, but more especially the unfortunate parish apprentices,\r\nwere almost always cruelly used, starved, beaten, and over-worked by\r\ntheir masters, and treated as outcasts by all with whom they came in\r\ncontact: there can be no wonder, then, that, driven in this manner from\r\nall other society, they gladly availed themselves of the companionship\r\nof their fellow-sufferers; quickly imbibed all their habits and\r\npeculiarities; and, perhaps, ended by becoming themselves the most\r\ntyrannical masters to those who might happen to be placed under their\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the disrepute in which sweepers have ever been held,\r\nthere are many classes of workers beneath them in intelligence. All the\r\ntribe of finders and collectors (with the exception of the dredgermen,\r\nwho are an observant race, and the sewer-hunters, who, from the danger\r\nof their employment, are compelled to exercise their intellects) are\r\nfar inferior to them in this respect; and they are clever fellows\r\ncompared to many of the dustmen and scavagers. The great mass of the\r\nagricultural labourers are known to be almost as ignorant as the beasts\r\nthey drive; but the sweepers, from whatever cause it may arise, are\r\nknown, in many instances, to be shrewd, intelligent, and active.\r\n\r\nBut there is much room for improvement among the operative\r\nchimney-sweepers. Speaking of the men generally, I am assured that\r\nthere is scarcely one out of ten who can either read or write. One man\r\nin Chelsea informed me that some ladies, in connection with the Rev.\r\nMr. Cadman’s church, made an attempt to instruct the sweepers of the\r\nneighbourhood in reading and writing; but the master sweepers grew\r\njealous, and became afraid lest their men should get too knowing for\r\nthem. When the time came, therefore, for the men to prepare for the\r\nschool, the masters always managed to find out some job which prevented\r\nthem from attending at the appointed time, and the consequence was that\r\nthe benevolent designs of the ladies were frustrated.\r\n\r\nThe sweepers, as a class, in almost all their habits, bear a\r\nstrong resemblance to the costermongers. The habit of going about\r\nin search of their employment has, of itself, implanted in many\r\nof them the wandering propensity peculiar to street people. Many\r\nof the better-class costermongers have risen into coal-shed men\r\nand greengrocers, and become settled in life; in like manner the\r\nbetter-class sweepers have risen to be masters, and, becoming\r\nsettled in a locality, have gradually obtained the trade of the\r\nneighbourhood; then, as their circumstances improved, they have been\r\nable to get horses and carts, and become nightmen; and there are many\r\nof them at this moment men of wealth, comparatively speaking. The\r\ngreat body of them, however, retain in all their force their original\r\ncharacteristics; the masters themselves, although shrewd and sensible\r\nmen, often betray their want of education, and are in no way particular\r\nas to their expressions, their language being made up, in a great\r\nmeasure, of the terms peculiar to the costermongers, especially the\r\ndenominations of the various sorts of money. I met with some sweepers,\r\nhowever, whose language was that in ordinary use, and their manners\r\nnot vulgar. I might specify one, who, although a workhouse orphan\r\nand apprentice, a harshly-treated climbing-boy, is now prospering as\r\na sweeper and nightman, is a regular attendant at all meetings to\r\npromote the good of the poor, and a zealous ragged-school teacher, and\r\nteetotaller.\r\n\r\nWhen such men are met with, perhaps the class cannot be looked upon\r\nas utterly cast away, although the need of reformation in the habits\r\nof the working sweepers is extreme, and especially in respect of\r\ndrinking, gambling, and dirt. The journeymen (who have often a good\r\ndeal of leisure) and the single-handed men are--in the great majority\r\nof cases at least--addicted to drinking, beer being their favourite\r\nbeverage, either because it is the cheapest or that they fancy it the\r\nmost suitable for washing away the sooty particles which find their way\r\nto their throats. These men gamble also, but with this proviso--they\r\nseldom play for money; but when they meet in their usual houses of\r\nresort--two famous ones are in Back C---- lane and S---- street,\r\nWhitechapel--they spend their time and what money they may have in\r\ntossing for beer, till they are either drunk or penniless. Such men\r\npresent the appearance of having just come out of a chimney. There\r\nseems never to have been any attempt made by them to wash the soot\r\noff their faces. I am informed that there is scarcely one of them who\r\nhas a second shirt or any change of clothes, and that they wear their\r\ngarments night and day till they literally rot, and drop in fragments\r\nfrom their backs. Those who are not employed as journeymen by the\r\nmasters are frequently whole days without food, especially in summer,\r\nwhen the work is slack; and it usually happens that those who are\r\nwhat is called “knocking about on their own account” seldom or never\r\nhave a farthing in their pockets in the morning, and may, perhaps,\r\nhave to travel till evening before they get a threepenny or sixpenny\r\nchimney to sweep. When night comes, and they meet their companions, the\r\ntossing and drinking again commences; they again get drunk; roll home\r\nto wherever it may be, to go through the same routine on the morrow;\r\nand this is the usual tenour of their lives, whether earning 5_s._ or\r\n20_s._ a week.\r\n\r\nThe chimney-sweepers generally are fond of drink; indeed their calling,\r\nlike that of dustmen, is one of those which naturally lead to it. The\r\nmen declare they are ordered to drink gin and smoke as much as they\r\ncan, in order to rid the stomach of the soot they may have swallowed\r\nduring their work.\r\n\r\n_Washing_ among chimney-sweepers seems to be much more frequent than it\r\nwas. In the evidence before Parliament it was stated that some of the\r\nclimbing-boys were washed once in six months, some once a week, some\r\nonce in two or three months. I do not find it anywhere stated that any\r\nof these children were never washed at all; but from the tenour of the\r\nevidence it may be reasonably concluded that such was the case.\r\n\r\nA master sweeper, who was in the habit of bathing at the Marylebone\r\nbaths once and sometimes twice a week, assured me that, although many\r\nnow eat and drink and sleep sooty, washing is more common among his\r\nclass than when he himself was a climbing-boy. He used then to be\r\nstripped, and compelled to step into a tub, and into water sometimes\r\ntoo hot and sometimes too cold, while his mistress, to use his own\r\nword, _scoured_ him. Judging from what he had seen and heard, my\r\ninformant was satisfied that, from 30 to 40 years ago, climbing-boys,\r\nwith a very few exceptions, were but seldom washed; and then it was\r\nlooked upon by them as a most disagreeable operation, often, indeed, as\r\na species of punishment. Some of the climbing-boys used to be taken by\r\ntheir masters to bathe in the Serpentine many years ago; but one boy\r\nwas unfortunately drowned, so that the children could hardly be coerced\r\nto go into the water afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe washing among the chimney-sweepers of the present day, when there\r\nare scarcely any climbing-boys, is so much an individual matter that\r\nit is not possible to speak with any great degree of certainty on the\r\nsubject, but that it increases may be concluded from the fact that the\r\nnumber of sweeps who resort to the public baths increases.\r\n\r\nThe first public baths and washhouses opened in London were in the\r\n“north-west district,” and situated in George-street, Euston-square,\r\nnear the Hampstead-road. This establishment was founded by voluntary\r\ncontribution in 1846, and is now self-supporting.\r\n\r\nThere are three more public baths: one in Goulston-street, Whitechapel\r\n(on the same principle as that first established); another in St.\r\nMartin’s, near the National Gallery, which are parochial; and the\r\nlast in Marylebone, near the Yorkshire Stingo tavern, New-road, also\r\nparochial. The charge for a cold bath, each being secluded from the\r\nothers, is 1_d._, with the use of a towel; a warm bath is 2_d._ in the\r\nthird class. The following is the return of the number of bathers at\r\nthe north-west district baths, the establishment most frequented:--\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                                | 1847. | 1848. | 1849. | 1850.\r\n                                +-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Bathers                       |110,940|111,788| 96,726| 86,597\r\n  Washers, Dryers, Ironers, &c. | 39,418| 61,690| 65,934| 73,023\r\n  Individuals Washed for        |137,672|246,760|263,736|292,092\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to ascertain the proportion of sweepers, with other\r\nworking men, who availed themselves of these baths; but there are\r\nunfortunately no data for instituting a comparison as to the relative\r\ncleanliness of the several trades. When the baths were first opened\r\nan endeavour was made to obtain such a return; but it was found to be\r\ndistasteful to the bathers, and so was discontinued. We find, then,\r\nthat in four years there have been 406,051 bathers. The following gives\r\nthe proportion between the sexes, a portion of 1846 being included:--\r\n\r\n  Bathers--Males        417,424\r\n     „     Females       47,114\r\n                        -------\r\n  Total bathers         464,538\r\n\r\nThe falling off in the number of bathers at this establishment is, I am\r\ntold, attributable to the opening of new baths, the people, of course,\r\nresorting to the nearest.\r\n\r\nI have given the return of washers, &c., as I endeavoured to ascertain\r\nthe proportion of washing by the chimney-sweeper’s wives; but there is\r\nno specification of the trades of the persons using this branch of the\r\nestablishment any more than there is of those frequenting the baths,\r\nand for the same reason as prevented its being done among the bathers.\r\nOne of the attendants at these washhouses told me that he had no doubt\r\nthe sweepers’ wives did wash there, for he had more than once seen a\r\nsweeper waiting to carry home the clothes his wife had cleansed. As\r\nno questions concerning their situation in life are asked of the poor\r\nwomen who resort to these very excellent institutions (for such they\r\nappear to be on a cursory glance) of course no data can be supplied.\r\nThis is to be somewhat regretted; but a regard to the feelings, and in\r\nsome respects to the small prejudices, of the industrious poor is to\r\nbe commended rather than otherwise, and the managers of these baths\r\ncertainly seem to have manifested such a regard.\r\n\r\nI am informed, however, by the secretary of the north-west district\r\ninstitution, that in some weeks of the summer 80 chimney-sweepers\r\nbathed there; always having, he believed, warm baths, which are more\r\neffective in removing soot or dirt from the skin than cold. Summer, it\r\nmust be remembered, is the sweep’s “brisk” season. In a winter week as\r\nfew as 25 or 20 have bathed, but the weekly average of sweeper-bathers,\r\nthe year through, is about 50; and the number of sweeper-bathers, he\r\nthought, had increased since the opening of the baths about 10 per\r\ncent. yearly. As in 1850 the average number of bathers of all classes\r\ndid not exceed 1646 per week, the proportion of sweepers, 50, is high.\r\nThe number of female bathers is about one-ninth, so that the males\r\nwould be about 1480; and the 50 sweepers a week constitute about a\r\nthirtieth part of the whole of the third-class bathers. The number of\r\nsweep-bathers was known because a sweep is known by his appearance.\r\n\r\nI was told by the secretary that the sweepers, the majority bathing on\r\nSaturday nights, usually carried a bundle to the bath; this contained\r\ntheir “clean things.” After bathing they assumed their “Sunday\r\nclothes;” and from the change in their appearance between ingress and\r\negress, they were hardly recognisable as the same individuals.\r\n\r\nIn the other baths, where also there is no specification of the\r\nbathers, I am told, that of sweepers bathing the number (on\r\ncomputation) is 30 at Marylebone, 25 at Goulston-street, and 15 (at the\r\nleast) at St. Martin’s, as a weekly average. In all, 120 sweepers bathe\r\nweekly, or about a seventh of the entire working body. The increase at\r\nthe three baths last mentioned, in sweepers bathing, is from 5 to 10\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nAmong the lower-class sweepers there are but few who wash themselves\r\neven once throughout the year. They eat, drink, and sleep in the same\r\nstate of filth and dirt as when engaged in their daily avocation.\r\nOthers, however, among the better class are more cleanly in their\r\nhabits, and wash themselves every night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBetween _the appearance of the sweepers_ in the streets at the present\r\ntime and before the abolition of the system of climbing there is a\r\nmarked difference. Charles Lamb said (in 1823):--\r\n\r\n“I like to meet a sweep--understand me, not a grown sweeper--old\r\nchimney-sweepers are by no means attractive--but one of those tender\r\nnovices blooming through their first nigritude, the maternal washings\r\nnot quite effaced from the cheek--such as come forth with the dawn, or\r\nsomewhat earlier, with their little professional notes sounding like\r\nthe _peep peep_ of a young sparrow; or liker to the matin lark should\r\nI pronounce them, in their aerial ascents not seldom anticipating the\r\nsunrise?”\r\n\r\nThroughout his essay, Elia throws the halo of poetry over the\r\nchild-sweepers, calling them “dim specks,” “poor blots,” “innocent\r\nblacknesses,” “young Africans of our own growth;” the natural\r\nkindliness of the writer shines out through all. He counsels his reader\r\nto give the young innocent 2_d._, or, if the weather were starving,\r\n“let the demand on thy humanity rise to a tester” (6_d._).\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the little children-sweepers, as they trotted along\r\nat the master’s or the journeyman’s heels, or waited at “rich men’s\r\ndoors” on a cold morning, was pitiable in the extreme. If it snowed,\r\nthere was a strange contrast between the black sootiness of the\r\nsweeper’s dress and the white flakes of snow which adhered to it. The\r\nboy-sweeper trotted listlessly along; a sack to contain the soot thrown\r\nover his shoulder, or disposed round his neck, like a cape or shawl.\r\nOne master sweeper tells me that in his apprenticeship days he had\r\nto wait at the great mansions in and about Grosvenor-square, on some\r\nbitter wintry mornings, until he felt as if his feet, although he had\r\nboth stockings and shoes--and many young climbers were barefoot--felt\r\nas if frozen to the pavement. When the door was opened, he told me, the\r\nmatter was not really mended. The rooms were often large and cold, and\r\nbeing lighted only with a candle or two, no doubt looked very dreary,\r\nwhile there was not a fire in the whole house, and no one up but a\r\nyawning servant or two, often very cross at having been disturbed.\r\nThe servants, however, in noblemen’s houses, he also told me, were\r\nfrequently kind to him, giving him bread and butter, and sometimes\r\nbread and jam; and as his master generally had a glass of raw spirit\r\nhanded to him, the boy usually had a sip when his employer had “knocked\r\noff his glass.” His employer, indeed, sometimes said, “O, _he’s_ better\r\nwithout it; it’ll only larn him to drink, like it did me;” but the\r\nservant usually answered, “O, here, just a thimblefull for him.”\r\n\r\nThe usual dress of the climbing-boy--as I have learned from those who\r\nhad worn it themselves, and, when masters, had provided it for their\r\nboys--was made of a sort of strong flannel, which many years ago was\r\ncalled chimney-sweepers’ cloth; but my informant was not certain\r\nwhether this was a common name for it or not, he only remembered having\r\nheard it called so. He remembered, also, accompanying his master to\r\ndo something to the flues in a church, then (1817) hung with black\r\ncloth, as a part of the national mourning for the Princess Charlotte of\r\nWales, and he thought it seemed very like the chimney-sweepers’ cloth,\r\nwhich was dark coloured when new. The child-sweep wore a pair of cloth\r\ntrowsers, and over that a sort of tunic, or tight fitting shirt with\r\nsleeves; sometimes a little waistcoat and jacket. This, it must be\r\nborne in mind, was only the practice among the best masters (who always\r\nhad to find their apprentices in clothes); and was the practice among\r\nthem more and more in the later period of the climbing process, for\r\nhouseholders began to inquire as to what sort of trim the boys employed\r\non their premises appeared in. The poorer or the less well-disposed\r\nmasters clad the urchins who climbed for them in any old rags which\r\ntheir wives could piece together, or in any low-priced garment “picked\r\nup” in such places as Rosemary-lane. The fit was no object at all.\r\nThese ill-clad lads were, moreover, at one time the great majority.\r\nThe clothes were usually made “at home” by the women, and in the same\r\nstyle, as regarded the seams, &c., as the sacks for soot; but sometimes\r\nthe work was beyond the art of the sweeper’s wife, and then the aid\r\nof some poor neighbour better skilled in the use of her scissors and\r\nneedle, or of some poor tailor, was called in, on the well-known terms\r\nof “a shilling (or 1_s._ 6_d._) a day, and the grub.”\r\n\r\nThe cost of a climbing-boy’s dress, I was informed, varied, when new,\r\naccording to the material of which it was made, from 3_s._ 6_d._ to\r\n6_s._ 6_d._ independently of the cost of making, which, in the hands of\r\na tailor who “whipped the cat” (or went out to work at his customer’s\r\nhouses), would occupy a day, at easy labour, at a cost of 1_s._ 6_d._\r\n(or less) in money, and the “whip-cat’s” meals, perhaps another 1_s._\r\n6_d._, beer included. As to the cost of a sweeper’s second-hand\r\nclothing it is useless to inquire; but I was informed by a now\r\nthriving master, that when he was about twelve years old his mistress\r\nbought him a “werry tidy jacket, as seemed made for a gen’leman’s\r\nson,” in Petticoat-lane, one Sunday morning, for 1_s._ 6_d._; while\r\nother things, he said, were “in proportionate.” Shoes and stockings\r\nare not included in the cost of the little sweeper’s apparel; and they\r\nwere, perhaps, always bought second-hand. A few of the best masters\r\n(or of those wishing to stand best in their customers’ regards), who\r\nsent their boys to church or to Sunday schools, had then a non-working\r\nattire for them; either a sweeper’s dress of jacket and trowsers,\r\nunsoiled by soot, or the ordinary dress of a poor lad.\r\n\r\nThe street appearance of the present race of sweepers, all adults,\r\nmay every here and there bear out Charles Lamb’s dictum, that grown\r\nsweepers are by no means attractive. Some of them are broad-shouldered\r\nand strongly-built men, who, as they traverse the streets, sometimes\r\nlook as grim as they are dingy. The chimney-scavager carries the\r\nimplement of his calling propped on his shoulder, in the way shown in\r\nthe daguerreotype which I have given. His dress is usually a jacket,\r\nwaistcoat, and trowsers of dark-coloured corduroy; or instead of a\r\njacket a waistcoat with sleeves. Over this when at work the sweeper\r\noften wears a sort of blouse or short smock-frock of coarse strong\r\ncalico or canvas, which protects the corduroy suit from the soot.\r\nIn this description of the sweeper’s garb I can but speak of those\r\nwhose means enable them to attain the comfort of warm apparel in the\r\nwinter; the poorer part of the trade often shiver shirtless under a\r\nblouse which half covers a pair of threadbare trowsers. The cost of the\r\ncorduroy suit I have mentioned varies, I was told by a sweeper, who put\r\nit tersely enough, “from 20_s._ _slop_, to 40_s._ _slap_.” The average\r\nruns, I believe, from 28_s._ to 33_s._, as regards the better class of\r\nthe sweepers.\r\n\r\nThe _diet of the journeymen sweepers and the apprentices_, and\r\nsometimes of their working employer, was described to me as generally\r\nafter the following fashion. My informant, a journeyman, calculated\r\nwhat his food “stood his master,” as he had once “kept hisself.”\r\n\r\n                                                Daily.\r\n                                              _s._ _d._\r\n  Bread and butter and coffee for breakfast    0    2\r\n\r\n  A saveloy and potatoes, or cabbage;\r\n  or a “fagot,” with the same vegetables; or\r\n  fried fish (but not often); or pudding,\r\n  from a pudding-shop; or soup (a twopenny\r\n  plate) from a cheap eating-house; average\r\n  from 2_d._ to 3_d._                          0    2-1/2\r\n\r\n  Tea, same as breakfast                       0    2\r\n                                               ----------\r\n                                               0    6-1/2\r\n\r\nOn Sundays the fare was better. They then sometimes had a bit of “prime\r\nfat mutton” taken to the oven, with “taturs to bake along with it;” or\r\na “fry of liver, if the old ’oman was in a good humour,” and always a\r\npint of beer apiece. Hence, as some give their men beer, the average\r\namount of 5_s._ or 6_s._ weekly, which I have given as the cost of\r\nthe “board” to the masters, is made up. The drunken single-handed\r\nmaster-men, I am told, live on beer and “a bite of anything they can\r\nget.” I believe there are few complaints of inefficient food.\r\n\r\nThe food provided by the large or high master sweepers is generally of\r\nthe same kind as the master and his family partake of; among this class\r\nthe journeymen are tolerably well provided for.\r\n\r\nIn the lower-class sweepers, however, the food is not so plentiful\r\nnor so good in kind as that provided by the high master sweepers. The\r\nexpense of keeping a man employed by a large master sometimes ranges\r\nas high as 8_s._ a week, but the average, I am told, is about 6_s._\r\nper week; while those employed by the low-class sweepers average about\r\n5_s._ a week. The cost of their lodging may be taken at from 1_s._ to\r\n2_s._ a week extra.\r\n\r\nThe sweepers in general are, I am assured, fond of oleaginous food; fat\r\nbroth, fagots, and what is often called “greasy” meat.\r\n\r\nThey are considered _a short-lived people_, and among the journeymen,\r\nthe masters “on their own hook,” &c., few old men are to be met with.\r\nIn one of the reports of the Board of Health, out of 4312 deaths\r\namong males, of the age of 15 and upwards, the mortality among the\r\nsweepers, masters and men, was 9, or one in 109 of the whole trade. As\r\nthe calculation was formed, however, from data supplied by the census\r\nof 1841, and on the Post Office Directory, it supplies no reliable\r\ninformation, as I shall show when I come to treat of the nightmen.\r\nMany of these men still suffer, I am told, from the chimney-sweeper’s\r\ncancer, which is said to arise mainly from uncleanly habits. Some\r\nsweepers assure me that they have vomited balls of soot.\r\n\r\n_As to the abodes of the master sweepers_, I can supply the following\r\naccount of two. The soot, I should observe, is seldom kept long, rarely\r\na month, on the premises of a sweeper, and is in the best “concerns”\r\nkept in cellars.\r\n\r\nThe localities in which many of the sweepers reside are the “lowest”\r\nplaces in the district. Many of the houses in which I found the\r\nlower class of sweepers were in a ruinous and filthy condition.\r\nThe “high-class” sweepers, on the other hand, live in respectable\r\nlocalities, often having back premises sufficiently large to stow away\r\ntheir soot.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to visit the house of one of the persons from whom I\r\nobtained much information. He is a master in a small way, a sensible\r\nman, and was one of the few who are teetotallers. His habitation,\r\nthough small--being a low house only one story high--was substantially\r\nfurnished with massive mahogany chairs, table, chests of drawers, &c.,\r\nwhile on each side of the fire-place, which was distinctly visible from\r\nthe street over a hall door, were two buffets, with glass doors, well\r\nfilled with glass and china vessels. It was a wet night, and a fire\r\nburned brightly in the stove, by the light of which might be seen the\r\nmaster of the establishment sitting on one side, while his wife and\r\ndaughter occupied the other; a neighbour sat before the fire with his\r\nback to the door, and altogether it struck me as a comfortable-looking\r\nevening party. They were resting and chatting quietly together after\r\nthe labour of the day, and everything betokened the comfortable\r\ncircumstances in which the man, by sobriety and industry, had been able\r\nto place himself. Yet this man had been a climbing-boy, and one of the\r\nunfortunates who had lost his parents when a child, and was apprenticed\r\nby the parish to this business. From him I learned that his was not a\r\nsolitary instance of teetotalism (I have before spoken of another);\r\nthat, in fact, there were some more, and one in particular, named\r\nBrown, who was a good speaker, and devoted himself during his leisure\r\nhours at night in advocating the principles which by experience he had\r\nfound to effect such great good to himself; but he also informed me\r\nthat the majority of the others were a drunken and dissipated crew,\r\nsunk to the lowest degree of misery, yet recklessly spending every\r\nfarthing they could earn in the public-house.\r\n\r\nDifferent in every respect was another house which I visited in\r\nthe course of my inquiries, in the neighbourhood of H-----street,\r\nBethnal-green. The house was rented by a sweeper, a master on his own\r\naccount, and every room in the place was let to sweepers and their\r\nwives or women, which, with these men, often signify one and the same\r\nthing. The inside of the house looked as dark as a coal-pit; there was\r\nan insufferable smell of soot, always offensive to those unaccustomed\r\nto it; and every person and every thing which met the eye, even to the\r\ncaps and gowns of the women, seemed as if they had just been steeped\r\nin Indian ink. In one room was a sweep and his woman quarrelling. As\r\nI opened the door I caught the words, “I’m d----d if I has it any\r\nlonger. I’d see you b----y well d----d first, and you knows it.” The\r\nsavage was intoxicated, for his red eyes flashed through his sooty\r\nmask with drunken excitement, and his matted hair, which looked as if\r\nit had never known a comb, stood out from his head like the whalebone\r\nribs of his own machine. “B----y Bet,” as he called her, did not\r\nseem a whit more sober than her man; and the shrill treble of her\r\nvoice was distinctly audible till I turned the corner of the street,\r\nwhither I was accompanied by the master of the house, to whom I had\r\nbeen recommended by one of the fraternity as an intelligent man, and\r\none who knew “a thing or two.” “You see,” he said, as we turned the\r\ncorner, “there isn’t no use a talkin’ to them ere fellows--they’re all\r\ntosticated now, and they doesn’t care nothink for nobody; but they’ll\r\nbe quiet enough to-morrow, ’cept they yarns somethink, and if they\r\ndo then they’ll be just as bad to-morrow night. They’re a awful lot,\r\nand nobody ill niver do anythink with them.” This man was not by any\r\nmeans in such easy circumstances as the master first mentioned. He was\r\nmerely a man working for himself, and unable to employ any one else in\r\nthe business; as is customary with some of these people, he had taken\r\nthe house he had shown me to let to lodgers of his own class, making\r\nsomething by so doing; though, if his own account be correct, I’m at\r\na loss to imagine how he contrived even to get his rent. From him I\r\nobtained the following statement:--\r\n\r\n“Yes, I was a climbing-boy, and sarved a rigler printiceship for seven\r\nyears. I was out on my printiceship when I was fourteen. Father was a\r\nsilk-weaver, and did all he knew to keep me from being a sweep, but I\r\nwould be a sweep, and nothink else.” [This is not so very uncommon a\r\npredilection, strange as it may seem.] “So father, when he saw it was\r\nno use, got me bound printice. Father’s alive now, and near 90 years of\r\nage. I don’t know why I wished to be a sweep, ’cept it was this--there\r\nwas sweeps always lived about here, and I used to see the boys with\r\nlots of money a tossin’ and gamblin’, and wished to have money too.\r\nYou see they got money where they swept the chimneys; they used to\r\nget 2_d._ or 3_d._ for theirselves in a day, and sometimes 6_d._ from\r\nthe people of the house, and that’s the way they always had plenty of\r\nmoney. I niver thought anythink of the climbing; it wasn’t so bad at\r\nall as some people would make you believe. There are two or three ways\r\nof climbing. In wide flues you climb with your elbows and your legs\r\nspread out, your feet pressing against the sides of the flue; but in\r\nnarrow flues, such as nine-inch ones, you must slant it; you must have\r\nyour sides in the angles, it’s wider there, and go up just that way.”\r\n[Here he threw himself into position--placing one arm close to his\r\nside, with the palm of the hand turned outwards, as if pressing the\r\nside of the flue, and extending the other arm high above his head, the\r\nhand apparently pressing in the same manner.] “There,” he continued,\r\n“that’s slantin’. You just put yourself in that way, and see how small\r\nyou make yourself. I niver got to say stuck myself, but a many of them\r\ndid; yes, and were taken out dead. They were smothered for want of\r\nair, and the fright, and a stayin’ so long in the flue; you see the\r\nwaistband of their trowsers sometimes got turned down in the climbing,\r\nand in narrow flues, when not able to get it up, then they stuck. I\r\nhad a boy once--we were called to sweep a chimney down at Poplar. When\r\nwe went in he looked up the flues, ‘Well, what is it like?’ I said.\r\n‘Very narrow,’ says he, ‘don’t think I can get up there;’ so after some\r\ntime we gets on top of the house, and takes off the chimney-pot, and\r\nhas a look down--it was wider a’ top, and I thought as how he could\r\ngo down. ‘You had better buff it, Jim,’ says I. I suppose you know\r\nwhat that means; but Jim wouldn’t do it, and kept his trowsers on. So\r\ndown he goes, and gets on very well till he comes to the shoulder of\r\nthe flue, and then he couldn’t stir. He shouts down, ‘I’m stuck.’ I\r\nshouts up and tells him what to do. ‘Can’t move,’ says he, ‘I’m stuck\r\nhard and fast.’ Well, the people of the house got fretted like, but I\r\nsays to them, ‘Now my boy’s stuck, but for Heaven’s sake don’t make\r\na word of noise; don’t say a word, good or bad, and I’ll see what I\r\ncan do.’ So I locks the door, and buffs it, and forces myself up till\r\nI could reach him with my hand, and as soon as he got his foot on my\r\nhand he begins to prize himself up, and gets loosened, and comes out\r\nat the top again. I was stuck myself, but I was stronger nor he, and\r\nI manages to get out again. Now I’ll be bound to say if there was\r\nanother master there as would kick up a row and a-worrited, that ere\r\nboy ’ud a niver come out o’ that ere flue alive. There was a many o’\r\nthem lost their lives in that way. Most all the printices used to come\r\nfrom the ‘House’ (workhouse.) There was nobody to care for them, and\r\nsome masters used them very bad. I was out of my time at fourteen, and\r\nbegan to get too stout to go up the flues; so after knockin’ about\r\nfor a year or so, as I could do nothink else, I goes to sea on board\r\na man-o’-war, and was away four year. Many of the boys, when they got\r\ntoo big and useless, used to go to sea in them days--they couldn’t do\r\nnothink else. Yes, many of them went for sodgers; and I know some who\r\nwent for Gipsies, and others who went for play-actors, and a many who\r\ngot on to be swell-mobsmen, and thieves, and housebreakers, and the\r\nlike o’ that ere. There ain’t nothink o’ that sort a-goin’ on now since\r\nthe Ack of Parliament. When I got back from sea father asked me to larn\r\nhis business; so I takes to the silk-weaving and larned it, and then\r\nmarried a weaveress, and worked with father for a long time. Father was\r\nvery well off--well off and comfortable for a poor man--but trade was\r\ngood then. But it got bad afterwards, and none on us was able to live\r\nat it; so I takes to the chimney-sweeping again. _A man might manage to\r\nlive somehow at the sweeping, but the weaving was o’ no use._ It was\r\nthe furrin silks as beat us all up, that’s the whole truth. Yet they\r\ntells us as how they was a-doin’ the country good; but they may tell\r\nthat to the marines--the sailors won’t believe it--not a word on it.\r\nI’ve stuck to the sweeping ever since, and sometimes done very fair at\r\nit; but since the Ack there’s so many leeks come to it that I don’t\r\nknow how they live--they must be eatin’ one another up.\r\n\r\n“Well, since you ask then, I can tell you that our people don’t care\r\nmuch about law; they don’t understand anythink about politics much;\r\nthey don’t mind things o’ that ere kind. They only minds to get drunk\r\nwhen they can. Some on them fellows as you seed in there niver cleans\r\ntheirselves from one year’s end to the other. They’ll kick up a row\r\nsoon enough, with Chartists or anybody else. I thinks them Chartists\r\nare a weak-minded set; they was too much a frightened at nothink,--a\r\nhundred o’ them would run away from one blue-coat, and that wasn’t like\r\nmen. I was often at Chartist meetings, and if they’d only do all they\r\nsaid there was a plenty to stick to them, for there’s a somethink wants\r\nto be done very bad, for everythink is a-gettin’ worser and worser\r\nevery day. I used to do a good trade, but now I don’t yarn a shilling\r\na day all through the year (?). I may walk at this time three or four\r\nmiles and not get a chimney to sweep, and then get only a sixpence or\r\nthreepence, and sometimes nothink. It’s a starvin’, that’s what it is;\r\nthere’s so much ‘querying’ a-goin’ on. Querying? that’s what we calls\r\nunder-working[61]. If they’d all fix a riglar price we might do very\r\nwell still. I’m 50 years of age, or thereabouts. I don’t know much\r\nabout the story of Mrs. Montague; it was afore my time. I heard of it\r\nthough. I heard my mother talk about it; she used to read it out of\r\nbooks; she was a great reader--none on ’em could stand afore her for\r\nthat. I was often at the dinner--the masters’ dinner--that was for the\r\nboys; but that’s all done away long ago, since the Ack of Parliament.\r\nI can’t tell how many there was at it, but there’s such a lot it’s\r\nimpossible to tell. How could any one tell all the sweeps as is in\r\nLondon? I’m sure I can’t, and I’m sure nobody else can.”\r\n\r\nSome years back the sweepers’ houses were often indicated by an\r\nelaborate sign, highly coloured. A sweeper, accompanied by a “chummy”\r\n(once a common name for the climbing-boy, being a corruption of\r\nchimney), was depicted on his way to a red brick house, from the\r\nchimneys of which bright yellow flames were streaming. Below was the\r\ndetail of the things undertaken by the sweep, such as the extinction of\r\nfires in chimneys, the cleaning of smoke-jacks, &c., &c. A few of these\r\nsigns, greatly faded, may be seen still. A sweeper, who is settled in\r\nwhat is accounted a “genteel neighbourhood,” has now another way of\r\nmaking his calling known. He leaves a card whenever he hears of a new\r\ncomer, a tape being attached, so that it can be hung up in the kitchen,\r\nand thus the servants are always in possession of his address. The\r\nfollowing is a customary style:--\r\n\r\n“Chimneys swept by the improved machine, much patronized by the Humane\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n“W. H., Chimney Sweeper and Nightman, 1, ---- Mews, in returning thanks\r\nto the inhabitants of the surrounding neighbourhood for the patronage\r\nhe has hitherto received, begs to inform them that he sweeps all kinds\r\nof chimneys and flues in the best manner.\r\n\r\n“W. H., attending to the business himself, cleans smoke-jacks,\r\ncures smoky coppers, and extinguishes chimneys when on fire, with\r\nthe greatest care and safety; and, by giving the strictest personal\r\nattendance to business, performs what he undertakes with cleanliness\r\nand punctuality, whereby he hopes to ensure a continuance of their\r\nfavours and recommendations.\r\n\r\n“Clean cloths for upper apartments. Soot-doors to any size fixed.\r\nObserve the address, 1, ---- Mews, near ----.”\r\n\r\nAt the top of this card is an engraving of the machine; at the foot a\r\nrude sketch of a nightman’s cart, with men at work. All the cards I saw\r\nreiterated the address, so that no mistake might lead the customer to a\r\nrival tradesman.\r\n\r\n_As to their politics_, the sweepers are somewhat similar to the\r\ndustmen and costermongers. A fixed hatred to all constituted authority,\r\nwhich they appear to regard as the police and the “beaks,” seems to\r\nbe the sum total of their principles. Indeed, it almost assumes the\r\ncharacter of a fixed law, that persons and classes of persons who are\r\nthemselves disorderly, and to a certain extent lawless, always manifest\r\nthe most supreme contempt for the conservators of law and order in\r\nevery degree. The police are therefore hated heartily, magistrates\r\nare feared and abominated, and Queen, Lords, and Commons, and every\r\none in authority, if known anything about, are considered as natural\r\nenemies. A costermonger who happened to be present while I was making\r\ninquiries on this subject, broke in with this remark, “The costers is\r\nthe chaps--the government can’t do nothink with them--they allus licks\r\nthe government.” The sweepers have a sovereign contempt for all Acts of\r\nParliament, because the only Act that had any reference to themselves\r\n“threw open,” as they call it, their business to all who were needy\r\nenough and who had the capability of availing themselves of it. Like\r\nthe “dusties” they are, I am informed, in their proper element in times\r\nof riot and confusion; but, unlike them, they are, to a man, Chartists,\r\nunderstanding it too, and approving of it, not because it would be\r\ncalculated to establish a new order of things, but in the hope that, in\r\nthe transition from one system to the other, there might be plenty of\r\nnoise and riot, and in the vague idea that in some indefinable manner\r\ngood must necessarily accrue to themselves from any change that might\r\ntake place. This I believe to be in perfect keeping with the sentiments\r\nof similar classes of people in every country in the world.\r\n\r\nThe journeymen lay by no money when in work, as a fund to keep them\r\nwhen incapacitated by sickness, accident, or old age. There are,\r\nhowever, a few exceptions to the general improvidence of the class;\r\nsome few belong to sick and benefit societies, others are members of\r\nburial clubs. Where, however, this is not the case, and a sweeper\r\nbecomes unable, through illness, to continue his work, the mode usually\r\nadopted is to make a raffle for the benefit of the sufferer; the same\r\nmeans are resorted to at the death of a member of the trade. When a\r\nchimney-sweeper becomes infirm through age, he has mostly, if not\r\ninvariably, no refuge but the workhouse.\r\n\r\n_The chimney-sweepers generally are regardless of the marriage\r\nceremony_, and when they do live with a woman it is in a state\r\nof concubinage. These women are always among the lowest of the\r\nstreet-girls--such as lucifer-match and orange girls, some of the very\r\npoorest of the coster girls, and girls brought up among the sweepers.\r\nThey are treated badly by them, and often enough left without any\r\nremorse. The women are equally as careless in these matters as the men,\r\nand exchange one paramour for another with the same levity, so that\r\nthere is a promiscuous intercourse continually going on among them. I\r\nam informed that, among the worst class of sweepers living with women,\r\nnot one in 50 is married. To these couples very few children are\r\nborn; but I am not able to state the proportion as compared with other\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n_There are some curious customs among the London sweepers_ which\r\ndeserve notice. Their May-day festival is among the best known. The\r\nmost intelligent of the masters tell me that they have taken this\r\n“from the milkmen’s garland” (of which an engraving has been given).\r\nFormerly, say they, on the first of May the milkmen of London went\r\nthrough the streets, performing a sort of dance, for which they\r\nreceived gratuities from their customers. The music to which they\r\ndanced was simply brass plates mounted on poles, from the circumference\r\nof which plates depended numerous bells of different tones, according\r\nto size; these poles were adorned with leaves and flowers, indicative\r\nof the season, and may have been a relic of one of the ancient pageants\r\nor mummeries.\r\n\r\nThe sweepers, however, by adapting themselves more to the rude taste\r\nof the people, appear to have completely supplanted the milkmen, who\r\nare now never seen in pageantry. In Strutt’s “Sports and Pastimes of\r\nthe People of England,” I find the following with reference to the\r\nmilk-people:--\r\n\r\n“It is at this time,” that is in May, says the author of one of the\r\npapers in the _Spectator_, “we see brisk young wenches in the country\r\nparishes dancing round the Maypole. It is likewise on the first day of\r\nthis month that we see the ruddy milkmaid exerting herself in a most\r\nsprightly manner under a pyramid of silver tankards, and, like the\r\nVirgin Tarpeia, oppressed by the costly ornaments which her benefactors\r\nlay upon her. These decorations of silver cups, tankards, and salvers,\r\nwere borrowed for the purpose, and hung round the milk-pails, with the\r\naddition of flowers and ribands, which the maidens carried upon their\r\nheads when they went to the houses of their customers, and danced in\r\norder to obtain a small gratuity from each of them. In a set of prints,\r\ncalled ‘Tempest’s Cries of London,’ there is one called the ‘Merry\r\nMilkmaid,’ whose proper name was Kate Smith. She is dancing with the\r\nmilk-pail, decorated as above mentioned, upon her head. Of late years\r\nthe plate, with the other decorations, were placed in a pyramidical\r\nform, and carried by two chairmen upon a wooden horse. The maidens\r\nwalked before it, and performed the dance without any incumbrance. I\r\nreally cannot discover what analogy the silver tankards and salvers can\r\nhave to the business of the milkmaids. I have seen them act with much\r\nmore propriety upon this occasion, when, in place of these superfluous\r\nornaments, they substituted a cow. The animal had her horns gilt, and\r\nwas nearly covered with ribands of various colours formed into bows and\r\nroses, and interspersed with green oaken leaves and bunches of flowers.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MILKMAID’S GARLAND.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGINAL OF THE SWEEP’S MAY-DAY EXHIBITION.]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the May-day festival of the sweepers the same author\r\nsays:--“The chimney-sweepers of London have also singled out the first\r\nof May for their festival, at which time they parade the streets in\r\ncompanies, disguised in various manners. Their dresses are usually\r\ndecorated with gilt paper and other mock fineries; they have their\r\nshovels and brushes in their hands, which they rattle one upon the\r\nother; and to this rough music they jump about in imitation of dancing.\r\nSome of the larger companies have a fiddler with them, and a Jack\r\nin the Green, as well as a Lord and Lady of the May, who follow the\r\nminstrel with great stateliness, and dance as occasion requires. The\r\nJack in the Green is a piece of pageantry consisting of a hollow frame\r\nof wood or wicker-work, made in the form of a sugar-loaf, but open at\r\nthe bottom, and sufficiently large and high to receive a man. The frame\r\nis covered with green leaves and bunches of flowers, interwoven with\r\neach other, so that the man within may be completely concealed, who\r\ndances with his companions; and the populace are mightily pleased with\r\nthe oddity of the moving pyramid.”\r\n\r\nSince the date of the above, the sweepers have greatly improved\r\non their pageant, substituting for the fiddle the more noisy and\r\nappropriate music of the street-showman’s drum and pipes, and adding to\r\ntheir party several diminutive imps, no doubt as representatives of the\r\nclimbing-boys, clothed in caps, jackets, and trowsers, thickly covered\r\nwith party-coloured shreds. These still make a show of rattling their\r\nshovels and brushes, but the clatter is unheard alongside the thunders\r\nof the drum. In this manner they go through the various streets for\r\nthree days, obtaining money at various places, and on the third night\r\nhold a feast at one of their favourite public-houses, where all the\r\nsooty tribes resort, and, in company with their wives or girls, keep\r\nup their festivity till the next morning. I find that this festival is\r\nbeginning to disappear in many parts of London, but it still holds its\r\nground, and is as highly enjoyed as ever, in all the eastern localities\r\nof the metropolis.\r\n\r\nIt is but seldom that any of the large masters go out on May-day; this\r\ncustom is generally confined to the little masters and their men. The\r\ntime usually spent on these occasions is four days, during which as\r\nmuch as from 2_l._ to 4_l._ a day is collected; the sums obtained on\r\nthe three first days are divided according to the several kinds of work\r\nperformed. But the proceeds of the fourth day are devoted to a supper.\r\nThe average gains of the several performers on these occasions are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  My lady, who acts as Columbine,\r\n    and receives                     2_s._ per day.\r\n\r\n  My lord, who is often the master\r\n    himself, but usually one of the\r\n    journeymen                       3_s._    „\r\n\r\n  Clown                              3_s._    „\r\n\r\n  Drummer                            4_s._    „\r\n\r\n  Jack in the green, who is often an\r\n    individual acquaintance, and\r\n    does not belong to the trade     3_s._    „\r\n\r\n  And the boys, who have no term\r\n    term applied to them, receive\r\n    from                    1_s._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ „\r\n\r\nThe share accruing to the boys is often spent in purchasing some\r\narticle of clothing for them, but the money got by the other\r\nindividuals is mostly spent in drink.\r\n\r\nThe sweepers, however, not only go out on May-day, but likewise on\r\nthe 5th of November. On the last Guy-Fawkes day, I am informed, some\r\nof them received not only pence from the public, but silver and gold.\r\n“It was quite a harvest,” they say. One of this class, who got up a\r\ngigantic Guy Fawkes and figure of the Pope on the 5th of November,\r\n1850, cleared, I am informed, 10_l._ over and above all expenses.\r\n\r\nFor many years, also, the sweepers were in the habit of partaking of a\r\npublic dinner on the 1st of May, provided for every climbing-boy who\r\nthought proper to attend, at the expense of the Hon. Mrs. Montagu. The\r\nromantic origin of this custom, from all I could learn on the subject,\r\nis this:--The lady referred to, at the time a widow, lost her son,\r\nthen a boy of tender years. Inquiries were set on foot, and all London\r\nheard of the mysterious disappearance of the child, but no clue could\r\nbe found to trace him out. It was supposed that he was kidnapped, and\r\nthe search at length was given up in despair. A long time afterwards a\r\nsweeper was employed to cleanse the chimneys of Mrs. Montagu’s house,\r\nby Portman-square, and for this purpose, as was usual at the time,\r\nsent a climbing-boy up the chimney, who from that moment was lost to\r\nhim. The child did not return the way he went up, but it is supposed\r\nthat in his descent he got into a wrong flue, and found himself, on\r\ngetting out of the chimney, in one of the bedrooms. Wearied with his\r\nlabour, it is said that he mechanically crept between the sheets, all\r\nblack and sooty as he was. In this state he was found fast asleep by\r\nthe housekeeper. The delicacy of his features and the soft tones of his\r\nvoice interested the woman. She acquainted the family with the strange\r\ncircumstance, and, when introduced to them with a clean face, his voice\r\nand appearance reminded them of their lost child. It may have been that\r\nthe hardships he endured at so early an age had impaired his memory,\r\nfor he could give no account of himself; but it was evident, from his\r\nmanners and from the ease which he exhibited, that he was no stranger\r\nto such places, and at length, it is said, the Hon. Mrs. Montagu\r\nrecognised in him her long-lost son. The identity, it was understood,\r\nwas proved beyond doubt. He was restored to his rank in society, and\r\nin order the better to commemorate this singular restoration, and the\r\nfact of his having been a climbing-boy, his mother annually provided\r\nan entertainment on the 1st of May, at White Conduit House, for all\r\nthe climbing-boys of London who thought proper to partake of it. This\r\nannual feast was kept up during the lifetime of the lady, and, as\r\nmight be expected, was numerously attended, for since there were no\r\nquestion asked and no document required to prove any of the guests to\r\nbe climbing-boys, very many of the precocious urchins of the metropolis\r\nused to blacken their faces for this special occasion. This annual\r\nfeast continued, as I have said, as long as the lady lived. Her son\r\ncontinued it only for three or four years afterwards, and then, I am\r\ntold, left the country, and paid no further attention to the matter.\r\n\r\nOf the story of the young Montagu, Charles Lamb has given the following\r\naccount:--\r\n\r\n“In one of the state-beds at Arundel Castle, a few years since--under\r\na ducal canopy (that seat of the Howards is an object of curiosity to\r\nvisitors, chiefly for its beds, in which the late duke was especially\r\na connoisseur)--encircled with curtains of delicatest crimson, with\r\nstarry coronets interwoven--folded between a pair of sheets whiter\r\nand softer than the lap where Venus lulled Ascanius--was discovered\r\nby chance, after all methods of search had failed, at noon-day, fast\r\nasleep, a lost chimney-sweeper. The little creature having somehow\r\nconfounded his passage among the intricacies of those lordly chimneys,\r\nby some unknown aperture had alighted upon this magnificent chamber,\r\nand, tired with his tedious explorations, was unable to resist the\r\ndelicious invitement to repose, which he there saw exhibited; so,\r\ncreeping between the sheets very quietly, he laid his black head on\r\nthe pillow and slept like a young Howard.”.... “A high instinct,”\r\nadds Lamb, “was at work in the case, or I am greatly mistaken. Is it\r\nprobable that a poor child of that description, with whatever weariness\r\nhe might be visited, would have ventured under such a penalty as he\r\nwould be taught to expect, to uncover the sheets of a duke’s bed, and\r\ndeliberately to lay himself down between them, when the rug or the\r\ncarpet presented an obvious couch still far above his pretensions?--is\r\nthis probable, I would ask, if the great power of nature, which I\r\ncontend for, had not been manifested within him, prompting to the\r\nadventure? Doubtless, this young nobleman (for such my mind misgives\r\nme he must be) was allured by some memory not amounting to full\r\nconsciousness of his condition in infancy, when he was used to be lapt\r\nby his mother or his nurse in just such sheets as he there found,\r\ninto which he was now but creeping back as into his proper incubation\r\n(_incunabula_) and resting place. By no other theory than by his\r\nsentiment of a pre-existent state (as I may call it) can I explain a\r\ndeed so venturous.”\r\n\r\nThere is a strong strain of romance throughout the stories of the lost\r\nand found young Montagu. I conversed with some sweepers on the subject.\r\nThe majority had not so much as heard of the occurrence, but two who\r\nhad heard of it--both climbing-boys in their childhood--had heard\r\nthat the little fellow was found in his mother’s house. In a small\r\nwork, the “Chimney-Sweepers’ Friend,” got up in aid of the Society for\r\nthe Supersedence of Climbing Boys, by some benevolent Quaker ladies\r\nand others (the Quakers having been among the warmest supporters of\r\nthe suppression of climbers), and “arranged” (the word “edited” not\r\nbeing used) by J. Montgomery, the case of the little Montagu is not\r\nmentioned, excepting in two or three vague poetical allusions.\r\n\r\nThe account given by Lamb (although pronounced apocryphal by some)\r\nappears to be the more probable version; and to the minds of many is\r\nshown to be conclusively authentic, as I understand that, when Arundel\r\nCastle is shown to visitors, the bed in which the child was found is\r\npointed out; nor is it likely that in such a place the story of the\r\nducal bed and the little climbing-boy would be _invented_.\r\n\r\nThe following account was given by the wife of a respectable man (now\r\na middle-aged woman) and she had often heard it from her mother, who\r\npassed a long life in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Montagu’s residence:--\r\n\r\n“Lady M. had a son of tender years, who was supposed to have been\r\nstolen for the sake of his clothes. Some time after, there was an\r\noccasion when the sweeps were necessary at Montagu House. A servant\r\nnoticed one of the boys, being at first attracted by his superior\r\nmanner, and her curiosity being excited fancied a resemblance in him\r\nto the lost child. She questioned his master respecting him, who\r\nrepresented that he had found him crying and without a home, and\r\nthereupon took him in, and brought him up to his trade. The boy was\r\nquestioned apart from his master, as to the treatment he received; his\r\nanswers were favourable; and the consequence was, a compensation was\r\ngiven to the man, and the boy was retained. All doubt was removed as to\r\nhis identity.”\r\n\r\nThe annual feast at “White Condick,” so agreeable to the black\r\nfraternity, was afterwards continued in another form, and was the\r\norigin of a well-known society among the master sweepers, which\r\ncontinued in existence till the abolition of the climbing-boys by Act\r\nof Parliament. The masters and the better class of men paid a certain\r\nsum yearly, for the purpose of binding the children of the contributors\r\nto other trades. In order to increase the funds of this institution, as\r\nthe dinner to the boys at White Conduit House was an established thing,\r\nthe masters continued it, and the boys of every master who belonged to\r\nthe society went in a sort of state to the usual place of entertainment\r\nevery 1st of May, where they were regaled as formerly. Many persons\r\nwere in the habit of flocking on this day to White Conduit House to\r\nwitness the festivities of the sweepers on this occasion, and usually\r\ncontributed something towards the society. As soon, however, as the Act\r\npassed, this also was discontinued, and it is now one of the legends\r\nconnected with the class.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEEPING OF THE CHIMNEYS OF STEAM-VESSELS.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping of the flues in the boilers of steam-boats, in the Port\r\nof London, and also of land boilers in manufactories, is altogether\r\na distinct process, as the machine cannot be used until such time\r\nas the parties who are engaged in this business travel a long way\r\nthrough the flues, and reach the lower part of the chimney or funnel\r\nwhere it communicates with the boilers and receives the smoke in its\r\npassage to the upper air. The boilers in the large sea-going steamers\r\nare of curious construction; in some large steamers there are four\r\nseparate boilers with three furnaces in each, the flues of each boiler\r\nuniting in one beneath the funnel; immediately beyond the end of the\r\nfurnace, which is marked by a little wall constructed of firebrick to\r\nprevent the coals and fire from running off the firebars, there is a\r\nlarge open space very high and wide, and which space after a month’s\r\nsteaming is generally filled up with soot, somewhat resembling a snow\r\ndrift collected in a hollow, were it not for its colour and the fact\r\nthat it is sometimes in a state of ignition; it is, at times, so\r\ndeep, that a man sinks to his middle in it the moment he steps across\r\nthe firebridge. Above his head, and immediately over the end of the\r\nfurnace, he may perceive an opening in what otherwise would appear to\r\nbe a solid mass of iron; up to this opening, which resembles a doorway,\r\nthe sweeper must clamber the best way he can, and when he succeeds in\r\nthis he finds himself in a narrow passage completely dark, but with so\r\nstrong a current of air rushing through it from the furnaces beneath\r\ntowards the funnel overhead that it is with difficulty the wick lamp\r\nwhich he carries in his hand can be kept burning. This passage, between\r\nthe iron walls on either side, is lofty enough for a tall man to stand\r\nupright in, but does not seem at first of any great extent; as he\r\ngoes on, however, to what appears the end, he finds out his mistake,\r\nby coming to a sharp turn which conducts him back again towards the\r\nopen space in the centre of the boiler, but which is now hid from him\r\nby the hollow iron walls which on every side surround him, and within\r\nwhich the waters boil and seethe as the living flames issuing from the\r\nfurnaces rush and roar through these winding passages; another sharp\r\nturn leads back to the front of the boilers, and so on for seven or\r\neight turns, backwards and forwards, like the windings in a maze, till\r\nat the last turn a light suddenly breaks upon him, and, looking up,\r\nhe perceives the hollow tube of the funnel, black and ragged with the\r\nadhering soot.\r\n\r\nHere, then, the labour of the sweeper commences: he is armed with a\r\nbrush and shovel, and laying down his lamp in a space from which he\r\nhas previously shovelled away the soot, which in many parts of the\r\npassage is knee deep, he brushes down the soot from the sides and roof\r\nof the passage, which being done he shovels it before him into the\r\nnext winding; this process he repeats till he reaches, by degrees, the\r\nopening where he ascended. Whenever the accumulation of soot is so\r\ngreat that it is likely to block up the passage in the progress of his\r\nwork, he wades through and shovels as much as he thinks necessary out\r\nof the opening into the large space behind the furnaces, then resumes\r\nhis work, brushing and shovelling by turns, till the flues are cleared;\r\nwhen this is accomplished, he descends, and the fire bars being\r\npreviously removed, he shovels the soot, now all collected together,\r\nover the firebridge and into the ashpit of the furnace; other persons\r\nstand ready in the stoke-hole armed with long iron rakes, with which\r\nthey drag out the soot from the ashpits; and others shovel it into\r\nsacks, which they make fast to tackle secured to the upper deck, by\r\nwhich they “bowse” it up out of the engine-room, and either discharge\r\nit overboard or put it into boats preparatory to being taken ashore. In\r\nthis manner an immense quantity of soot is removed from the boilers of\r\na large foreign-going steamer when she gets into port, after a month or\r\nsix weeks’ steaming, having burned in that time perhaps 700 or 800 tons\r\nof coal: this work is always performed by the stokers and coal-trimmers\r\nin the foreign ports, who seldom, if ever, get anything extra for it,\r\nalthough it is no uncommon thing for some of them to be ill for a week\r\nafter it.\r\n\r\nIn the port of London, however, the sweeper comes into requisition,\r\nwho, besides going through the process already described, brings his\r\nmachine with him, and is thus enabled to cleanse the funnel, and\r\nto increase the quantity of soot. Some of the master sweepers, who\r\nhave the cleansing of the steam-boats in the river, and the sweeping\r\nof boiler flues are obliged to employ a good many men, and make a\r\ngreat deal of money by their business. The use of anthracite coals,\r\nhowever, and some modern improvements, by which air at a certain\r\ntemperature is admitted to certain parts of the furnace, have in many\r\ninstances greatly lessened, if they have not altogether prevented,\r\nthe accumulation of soot, by the prevention of smoke; and it seems\r\nquite possible, from the statements made by many eminent scientific\r\nand practical men who were examined before a select committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons, presided over by Mr. Mackinnon, in 1843, that by\r\nhaving properly-constructed stoves, and a sufficient quantity of pure\r\nair properly admitted, not only less fuel might be burned, and produce\r\na greater amount of heat, but soot would cease to accumulate, so that\r\nthe necessity for sweepers would be no longer felt, and there would be\r\nno fear of fires from the ignition of soot in the flues of chimneys;\r\nblacks and smoke, moreover, would take their departure together; and\r\nwith them the celebrated London fog might also, in a great measure,\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nThe funnels of steamers are generally swept at from 8_d._ to 1_s._\r\n6_d._ per funnel. The Chelsea steamers are swept by Mr. Allbrook, of\r\nChelsea; the Continental, by Mr. Hawsey, of Rosemary-lane; and the\r\nIrish and Scotch steamers, by Mr. Tuff, who resides in the East London\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “RAMONEUR” COMPANY.\r\n\r\nThe Patent Ramoneur Company demands, perhaps, a special notice. It was\r\nformed between four and five years ago, and has now four stations: one\r\nin Little Harcourt-street, Bryanstone-square; another in New-road,\r\nSloane-street; a third in Charles-place, Euston-square; and the fourth\r\nin William-street, Portland-town.\r\n\r\n“This Company has been formed,” the prospectus stated, “for the purpose\r\nof cleansing chimneys with the Patent Ramoneur Machine, and introducing\r\nvarious other improvements in the business of chimney sweeping.\r\nChimneys are daily swept with this machine where others have failed.”\r\n\r\nThe Company charge the usual prices, and all the men employed have\r\nbeen brought up as sweepers. The patent machine is thus described:--\r\n\r\n“The Patent Ramoneur Machine consists of four brushes, forming a\r\nsquare head, which, by means of elastic springs, contracts or expands,\r\naccording to the space it moves in; the rods attached to this head or\r\nbrush are supplied at intervals with a universal spring-joint, capable\r\nof turning even a right angle, and the whole is surmounted with a\r\ndouble revolving ball, having also a universal spring-joint, which\r\nleads the brush with certainty into every corner, cleansing its route\r\nmost perfectly.”\r\n\r\nThe recommendation held out to the public is, that the patented\r\nchimney-machine sweeps cleaner than that in general use, and for the\r\nreasons assigned; and that, being constructed with more and better\r\nsprings, it is capable of “turning even a right angle,” which the\r\ncommon machine often leaves unswept. This was and is commonly said of\r\nthe difference between the cleansing of the chimney by a climbing-boy\r\nand that effected by the present mechanical appliances in general\r\nuse--the boy was “better round a corner.”\r\n\r\nThe patent machines now worked in London are fifteen in number, and\r\nfifteen men are thus employed. Each man receives as a weekly wage,\r\nalways in money, 14_s._, besides a suit of clothes yearly. The suit\r\nconsists of a jacket, waistcoat, and trousers, of dark-coloured\r\ncorduroy; also a “frock” or blouse, to wear when at work, and a cap;\r\nthe whole being worth from 35_s._ to 40_s._ This payment is about\r\nequivalent to that received weekly by the journeymen in the regular or\r\nhonourable trade; for although higher in nominal amount as a weekly\r\nremuneration, the Ramoneur operatives are not allowed any perquisites\r\nwhatever. The resident or manager at each station is also a working\r\nchimney-sweeper for the Company, and at the same rate as the others,\r\nhis advantage being that he lives rent-free. At one station which I\r\nvisited, the resident had two comfortable-looking up-stairs’-rooms (the\r\nstations being all in small streets), where he and his wife lived;\r\nwhile the “cellar,” which was indeed but the ground floor, although\r\nsomewhat lower than the doorstep, was devoted to business purposes, the\r\nsoot being stored there. It was boarded off into separate compartments,\r\none being at the time quite full of soot. All seemed as clean and\r\norderly as possible. The rent of those two rooms, unfurnished, would\r\nnot be less than 4_s._ or 5_s._ a week, so that the resident’s payment\r\nmay be put at about 50_l._ a year. The patent-machine operatives\r\nsweep, on an average, the same number of chimneys each, as a master\r\nchimney-sweeper’s men in a good way of business in the ordinary trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE BRISK AND SLACK SEASONS, AND THE CASUAL TRADE AMONG THE\r\nCHIMNEY-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\nAs among the rubbish-carters in the unskilled, and the tailors and\r\nshoemakers of the skilled trades, the sweepers’ trade also has its\r\nslackness and its briskness, and from the same cause--the difference in\r\nthe _seasons_. The seasons affecting the sweepers’ trade are, however,\r\nthe _natural_ seasons of the year, the recurring summer and winter,\r\nwhile the seasons influencing the employment of West-end tailors are\r\nthe _arbitrary_ seasons of fashion.\r\n\r\nThe chimney-sweepers’ _brisk_ season is in the winter, and especially\r\nat what may be in the respective households the periods of the\r\nresumption and discontinuance of sitting-room fires.\r\n\r\nThe sweepers’ seasons of briskness and slackness, indeed, may be said\r\nthen to be ruled by the thermometer, for the temperature causes the\r\nincrease or diminution of the number of fires, and consequently of the\r\nproduction of soot. The thermometrical period for fires appears to be\r\nfrom October to the following April, both inclusive (seven months), for\r\nduring that season the temperature is below 50°. I have seen it stated,\r\nand I believe it is merely a statement of a fact, that at one time, and\r\neven now in some houses, it was customary enough for what were called\r\n“great families” to have a fixed day (generally Michaelmas-day, Sept.\r\n29) on which to commence fires in the sitting-rooms, and another stated\r\nday (often May-day, May 1) on which to discontinue them, no matter what\r\nmight be the mean temperature, whether too warm for the enjoyment of a\r\nfire, or too cold comfortably to dispense with it. Some wealthy persons\r\nnow, I am told--such as call themselves “economists,” while their\r\nservants and dependants apply the epithet “mean”--defer fires until the\r\ntemperature descends to 42°, or from November to March, both inclusive,\r\na season of only five months.\r\n\r\nAs this question of the range of the thermometer evidently influences\r\nthe seasons, and therefore, the casual labour of the sweepers, I will\r\ngive the following interesting account of the changing temperature of\r\nthe metropolis, month by month, the information being derived from\r\nthe observations of 25 years (1805 to 1830), by Mr. Luke Howard. The\r\naverage temperature appears to be:--\r\n\r\n             Degrees.\r\n  January     35·1\r\n  February    38·9\r\n  March       42·0\r\n  April       47·5\r\n  May         54·9\r\n  June        59·6\r\n  July        63·1\r\n  August      57·1\r\n  September   50·1\r\n  October     42·4\r\n  November    41·9\r\n  December    38·3\r\n\r\nLondon, I may further state, is 2-1/2 degrees warmer than the country,\r\nespecially in winter, owing to the shelter of buildings and the\r\nmultiplicity of the fires in the houses and factories. In the summer\r\nthe metropolis is about 1-1/4 degree hotter than the country, owing to\r\nwant of free air in London, and to a cause little thought about--the\r\nreverberations from narrow streets. In spring and autumn, however, the\r\ntemperature of both town and country is nearly equal.\r\n\r\nIn London, moreover, the nights are 11·3 degrees colder than the days;\r\nin the country they are 15·4 degrees colder. The extreme ranges of\r\nthe temperature in the day, in the capital, are from 20° to 90°.\r\nThe thermometer _has_ fallen below zero in the night time, but not\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nIn London the hottest months are 28 degrees warmer than the coldest;\r\nthe temperature of July, which is the hottest month, being 63·1; and\r\nthat of January, the coldest month, 35·1 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe month in which there are the greatest number of extremes of heat\r\nand cold is January. In February and December there are (generally\r\nspeaking) only two such extreme variations, and five in July; through\r\nthe other months, however, the extremes are more diffused, and there\r\nare only two spring and two autumn months (April and June--September\r\nand November), which are not exposed to great differences of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature assumes a rate of increase in the different\r\nmonths, which may be represented by a curve nearly equal and parallel\r\nwith one representing the progress of the sun in declination.\r\n\r\nHoar-frosts occur when the thermometer is about 39°, and the dense\r\nyellow fogs, so peculiar to London, are the most frequent in the months\r\nof November, December, and January, whilst the temperature ranges below\r\n40°.\r\n\r\nThe busy season in the chimney-sweepers’ trade commences at the\r\nbeginning of November, and continues up to the month of May; during\r\nthe remainder of the year the trade is “slack.” When the slack season\r\nhas set in nearly 100 men are thrown out of employment. These, as\r\nwell as many of the single-handed masters, resort to other kinds of\r\nemployment. Some turn costermongers, others tinkers, knife-grinders,\r\n&c., and others migrate to the country and get a job at haymaking,\r\nor any other kind of unskilled labour. Even during the brisk season\r\nthere are upwards of 50 men out of employment; some of these\r\noccasionally contrive to get a machine of their own, and go about\r\n“knulling,”--getting a job where they can.\r\n\r\nMany of the master sweepers employ in the summer months only two\r\njourneymen, whereas they require three in the winter months; but this,\r\nI am informed, is not the general average, and that it will be more\r\ncorrect to compute it for the whole trade, in the proportion of two and\r\na half to two. We may, then, calculate that one-fourth of the entire\r\ntrade is displaced during the slack season.\r\n\r\nThis, then, may be taken as the extent of casual labour, with all\r\nthe sufferings it entails upon improvident, and even upon careful\r\nworking-men.\r\n\r\nA youth casually employed as a sweeper gave the following account:--“I\r\njobs for the sweeps sometimes, sir, as I’d job for anybody else, and\r\nif you have any herrands to go, and will send me, I’ll be unkimmon\r\nthankful. I haven’t no father and don’t remember one, and mother might\r\ndo well but for the ruin (gin). I calls it ‘ruin’ out of spite. No, I\r\ndon’t care for it myself. I like beer ten to a farthing to it. She’s a\r\nironer, sir, a stunning good one, but I don’t like to talk about her,\r\nfor she might yarn a hatful of browns--3_s._ 6_d._ a day; and when she\r\nhas pulled up for a month or more it’s stunning is the difference. I’d\r\nrather not be asked more about that. Her great fault against me is as I\r\nwon’t settle. I was one time put to a woman’s shoemaker as worked for\r\na ware’us. He was a relation, and I was to go prentice if it suited.\r\nBut I couldn’t stand his confining ways, and I’m sartain sure that he\r\nonly wanted me for some tin mother said she’d spring if all was square.\r\nHe was bad off, and we lived bad, but he always pretended he was going\r\nto be stunning busy. So I hooked it. I’d other places--a pot-boy’s was\r\none, but no go. None suited.\r\n\r\n“Well, I can keep myself now by jobbing, leastways I can partly, for I\r\nhave a crib in a corner of mother’s room, and my rent’s nothing, and\r\nwhen she’s all right _I’m_ all right, and she gets better as I grows\r\nbigger, I think. Well, I don’t know what I’d like to be; something\r\nlike a lamp-lighter, I think. Well, I look out for sweep jobs among\r\nothers, and get them sometimes. I don’t know how often. Sometimes three\r\nmornings a week for one week; then none for a month. Can any one live\r\nby jobbing that way for the sweeps? No, sir, nor get a quarter of a\r\nliving; but it’s a help. I know some very tidy sweeps now. I’m sure I\r\ndon’t know what they are in the way of trade. O, yes, now you ask that,\r\nI think they’re masters. I’ve had 6_d._ and half-a-pint of beer for a\r\nmorning’s work, jobbing like. I carry soot for them, and I’m lent a\r\nsort of jacket, or a wrap about me, to keep it off my clothes--though\r\na Jew wouldn’t sometimes look at ’em--and there’s worser people nor\r\nsweeps. Sometimes I’ll get only 2_d._ or 3_d._ a day for helping that\r\nway, a carrying soot. I don’t know nothing about weights or bushels,\r\nbut I know I’ve found it ---- heavy.\r\n\r\n“The way, you see, sir, is this here: I meets a sweep as knows me by\r\nsight, and he says, ‘Come along, Tom’s not at work, and I want you. I\r\nhave to go it harder, so you carry the soot to our place to save my\r\ntime, and join me again at No. 39.’ That’s just the ticket of it. Well,\r\nno; I wouldn’t mind being a sweep for myself with my own machine; but\r\nI’d rather be a lamp-lighter. How many help sweeps as I do? I can’t at\r\nall say. No, I don’t know whether it’s 10, or 20, or 100, or 1000. I’m\r\nno scholard, sir, that’s one thing. But it’s very seldom such as me’s\r\nwanted by them. I can’t tell what I get for jobbing for sweeps in a\r\nyear. I can’t guess at it, but it’s not so much, I think, as from other\r\nkinds of jobbing. Yes, sir, I haven’t no doubt that the t’others as\r\njobs for sweeps is in the same way as me. I think I may do as much as\r\nany of ’em that way, quite as much.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE “LEEKS” AMONG THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\nThe _Leeks_ are men who have not been brought up to the trade of\r\nchimney sweeping, but have adopted it as a speculation, and are so\r\ncalled from their entering _green_, or inexperienced, into the\r\nbusiness. There are I find as many as 200 leeks altogether among the\r\nmaster chimney-sweepers of the metropolis. Of the “high masters” the\r\ngreater portion are leeks--no less than 92 out of 106. I was informed\r\nthat one of this class was formerly a solicitor, others had been\r\nladies’ shoemakers, and others master builders and bricklayers. Among\r\nthe lower-class sweepers who have taken to this trade, there are\r\ndustmen, scavagers, bricklayers’ labourers, soldiers, costermongers,\r\ntinkers, and various other unskilled labourers.\r\n\r\nThe leeks are regarded with considerable dislike by the class of\r\nmasters who have been regularly brought up to the business, and served\r\ntheir apprenticeships as climbing-boys. These look upon the leeks\r\nas men who intrude upon, or interfere with, their natural and, as\r\nthey account it, legal rights--declaring that only such as have been\r\nbrought up to the business should be allowed to establish themselves\r\nin it as masters. The chimney-sweepers, as far as I can learn, have\r\nnever possessed any guild, or any especial trade regulations, and this\r\nopinion of their rights being invaded by the leeks arises most probably\r\nfrom their knowledge that during the climbing-boy system every lad so\r\nemployed, unless the son of his employer, was obliged to be apprenticed.\r\n\r\nThis jealousy towards the leeks does not at all affect the operative\r\nsweepers, as some of these leeks are good masters, and among them,\r\nperhaps, is to be found the majority of the capitalists of the\r\nchimney-sweeping trade, paying the best wages, and finding their\r\njourneymen proper food and lodging. Into whatever district I travelled\r\nI heard the operative chimney-sweepers speak highly in favour of some\r\nof the leeks.\r\n\r\nMany of the small masters, however, said “it were a shame” for persons\r\nwho had never known the horrors of climbing to come into the trade\r\nand take the bread out of the mouths of those who had undergone the\r\ndrudgery of the climbing system; and there appears to be some little\r\njustice in their remarks.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of machines into the chimney-sweeping trade\r\nthe masters have increased considerably. In 1816 there were 200\r\nmasters, and now there are 350. Before the machines were introduced,\r\nthe high master sweepers or “great gentlemen,” as they were called,\r\nnumbered only about 20; their present number is 106. The lower-class\r\nand master-men sweepers, on the other hand, were, under the climbing\r\nsystem, from 150 to 180 in number; but at present there are as many as\r\n240 odd. The majority of these fresh hands are “leeks,” not having been\r\nbred to the business.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE INFERIOR CHIMNEY-SWEEPERS--THE “KNULLERS” AND “QUERIERS.”\r\n\r\nThe majority of occupations in all civilized communities are divisible\r\ninto two distinct classes, the employers and the employed. The\r\nemployers are necessarily capitalists to a greater or less extent,\r\nproviding generally the materials and implements necessary for the\r\nwork, as well as the subsistence of the workmen, in the form of wages\r\nand appropriating the proceeds of the labour, while the employed are\r\nthose who, for the sake of the present subsistence supplied to them,\r\nundertake to do the requisite work for the employer. In some few trades\r\nthese two functions are found to be united in the same individuals.\r\nThe class known as peasant proprietors among the cultivators of the\r\nsoil are at once the labourers and the owners of the land and stock.\r\nThe cottiers, on the other hand, though renting the land of the\r\nproprietor, are, so to speak, peasant farmers, tilling the land for\r\nthemselves rather than doing so at wages for some capitalist tenant.\r\nIn handicrafts and manufactures the same combination of functions is\r\nfound to prevail. In the clothing districts the domestic workers are\r\ngenerally their own masters, and so again in many other branches of\r\nproduction. These trading operatives are known by different names\r\nin different trades. In the shoe trade, for instance, they are\r\ncalled “chamber-masters,” in the “cabinet trade” they are termed\r\n“garret-masters,” and in “the cooper’s trade” the name for them is\r\n“small trading-masters.” Some style them “master-men,” and others,\r\n“single-handed masters.” In all occupations, however, the master-men\r\nare found to be especially injurious to the interests of the entire\r\nbody of both capitalists and operatives, for, owing to the limited\r\nextent of their resources, they are obliged to find a market for their\r\nwork, no matter at what the sacrifice, and hence by their excessive\r\ncompetitions they serve to lower the prices of the trade to a most\r\nunprecedented extent. I have as yet met with no occupation in which the\r\nexistence of a class of master-men has worked well for the interest of\r\nthe trade, and I have found many which they have reduced to a state\r\nof abject wretchedness. It is a peculiar circumstance in connection\r\nwith the master-men that they abound only in those callings which\r\nrequire a small amount of capital, and which, consequently, render it\r\neasy for the operative immediately on the least disagreement between\r\nhim and his employer to pass from the condition of an operative into\r\nthat of a trading workman. When among the fancy cabinet-makers I had\r\na statement from a gentleman, in Aldersgate-street, who supplied the\r\nmaterials to these men, that a fancy cabinet-maker, the manufacturer\r\nof writing-desks, tea-caddies, ladies’ work-boxes, &c., could begin,\r\nand did begin, business on less than 3_s._ 6_d._ A youth had just\r\nthen bought materials of him for 2_s._ 6_d._ to “begin on a small\r\ndesk,” stepping at once out of the trammels of apprenticeship into the\r\ncharacter of a master-man. Now this facility to commence business on a\r\nman’s own account is far greater in the chimney-sweepers’ trade than\r\neven in the desk-makers’, for the one needs no previous training, while\r\nthe other does.\r\n\r\nThus when other trades, skilled or unskilled, are depressed, when\r\ncasual labour is with a mass of workpeople more general than constant\r\nlabour, they naturally inquire if they “cannot do better at something\r\nelse,” and often resort to such trades as the chimney-sweepers’. It\r\nis open to all, skilled and unskilled alike. Distress, a desire of\r\nchange, a vagabond spirit, a hope to “better themselves,” all tend to\r\nswell the ranks of the single-handed master chimney-sweepers; even\r\nthough these men, from the casualties of the trade in the way of\r\n“seasons,” &c., are often exposed to great privations.\r\n\r\nThere are in all 147 single-handed masters, who are thus distributed\r\nthroughout the metropolis:--\r\n\r\nSouthwark (17), Chelsea (11), Marylebone, Shoreditch, and\r\nWhitechapel (each 9), Hackney, Stepney, and Lambeth (each 8), St.\r\nGeorge’s-in-the-East (7), Rotherhithe (6), St. Giles’ and East London\r\n(each 5), Bethnal-green, Bermondsey, Camberwell, and Clapham (each 4),\r\nSt. Pancras, Islington, Walworth, and Greenwich (each 3), St. James’s\r\n(Westminster), Holborn, Clerkenwell, St. Luke’s, Poplar, Westminster,\r\nWest London, City, Wandsworth, and Woolwich (each 1); in all, 147.\r\n\r\nThus we perceive, that the single-handed masters abound in the suburbs\r\nand poorer districts; and it is generally in those parts where the\r\nlower rate of wages is paid that these men are found to prevail. Their\r\nexistence appears to be at once the cause and the consequence of the\r\ndepreciation of the labour.\r\n\r\nOf the single-handed masters there is a sub-class known by the name of\r\n“knullers” or “queriers.”\r\n\r\nThe _knullers_ were formerly, it is probable, known as knellers. The\r\nSaxon word _Cnyllan_ is to knell (to knull properly), or sound a bell,\r\nand the name “knuller” accordingly implies the sounder of a bell, which\r\nhas been done, there can be no doubt, by the London chimney-sweepers as\r\nwell as the dustmen, to announce their presence, and as still done in\r\nsome country parts. One informant has known this to be the practice at\r\nthe town of Hungerford in Berkshire. The bell was in size between that\r\nof the muffin-man and the dustman.\r\n\r\nThe knuller is also styled a “_querier_,” a name derived from his\r\nmaking _inquiries_ at the doors of the houses as to whether his\r\nservices are required or are likely to be soon required, calling even\r\nwhere they know that a regular resident chimney-sweeper is employed.\r\nThe men go along calling “sweep,” more especially in the suburbs, and\r\nif asked “Are you Mr. So-and-So’s man?” answer in the affirmative, and\r\nmay then be called in to sweep the chimneys, or instructed to come\r\nin the morning. Thus they receive the full charge of an established\r\nmaster, who, for the sake of his character and the continuance of his\r\ncustom, must do his work properly; while if such work be done by the\r\nknuller, it will be hurriedly and therefore badly done, as all work is,\r\nin a general way, when done under false pretences.\r\n\r\nSome of the sharpest of these men, I am told, have been reared up\r\nas sweepers; but it appears, although it is a matter difficult to\r\nascertain with precision, the majority have been brought up to some\r\ngenerally unskilled calling, as scavagers, costermongers, tinkers,\r\nbricklayers’ labourers, soldiers, &c. The knullers or queriers are\r\nalmost all to be found among the lower class chimney-sweepers. There\r\nare, from the best information to be obtained, from 150 to 200 of them.\r\nNot only do they scheme for employment in the way I have described,\r\nbut some of them call at the houses of both rich and poor, boldly\r\nstating that they had been _sent_ by Mr. ---- to sweep the flues. I\r\nwas informed by several of the master sweepers, that many of the fires\r\nwhich happen in the metropolis are owing to persons employing these\r\n“knullers,” “for,” say the high masters, “they scamp the work, and\r\nleave a quantity of soot lodged in the chimney, which, in the event\r\nof a large fire being kept in the range or grate, ignites.” This\r\nopinion as to the fires in the chimneys being caused by the scamped\r\nwork of the knullers must be taken with some allowance. Tradesmen,\r\nwhose established business is thus, as they account it, usurped, are\r\nnaturally angry with the usurpers.\r\n\r\nThere is another evil, so say the regular masters, resulting from the\r\nemployment of the knullers--the losses accruing to persons employing\r\nthem, as “they take anything they can lay their hands upon.”\r\n\r\nThis, also, is a charge easy to make, but not easy to refute, or even\r\nto sift. One master chimney-sweeper told me that when chimneys are\r\nswept in rich men’s houses there is almost always some servant in\r\nattendance to watch the sweepers. If the rich, I am told, be watchful\r\nunder these circumstances, the poor are more vigilant.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the knullers or queriers is as follows:--Southwark\r\n(17), Chelsea and St. Giles’ (11 each), Shoreditch and Whitechapel\r\n(10 each), Lambeth (9), Marylebone, Stepney and Walworth (8 each),\r\nSt. George’s in the East and Woolwich (7 each), Islington and\r\nHackney (6 each), East London, Rotherhithe, and Greenwich (5 each),\r\nPaddington, St. Pancras, East London, Rotherhithe and Greenwich\r\n(5 each), Paddington, St. Pancras, Bethnal Green, Bermondsey, and\r\nClapham (4 each), Westminster, St. Martin’s, Holborn, St. Luke’s, West\r\nLondon, Poplar, and Camberwell (3 each); St. James’s (Westminster),\r\nClerkenwell, City of London, and Wandsworth (2 each), Kensington (1);\r\nin all, 183.\r\n\r\nLike the single-handed men the knullers abound in the suburbs. I\r\nendeavoured to find a knuller who had been a skilled labourer, and\r\nwas referred to one who, I was told, had been a working plumber, and\r\na “good hand at spouts.” I found him a doggedly ignorant man; he saw\r\nno good, he said, in books or newspapers, and “wouldn’t say nothing to\r\nme, as I’d told him it would be printed. He wasn’t a going to make a\r\nholy-show [so I understood him] of _his_-self.”\r\n\r\nAnother knuller (to whom I was referred by a master who occasionally\r\nemployed him as a journeyman) gave me the following account. He was\r\n“doing just middling” when I saw him, he said, but his look was that of\r\na man who had known privations, and the soot actually seemed to bring\r\nout his wrinkles more fully, although he told me he was only between 40\r\nand 50 years old; he believed he was not 46.\r\n\r\n“I was hard brought up, sir,” he said; “ay, them as’ll read your\r\nbook--I mean them readers as is well to do--cannot fancy how hard.\r\nMother was a widow; father was nobody knew where; and, poor woman, she\r\nwas sometimes distracted that a daughter she had before her marriage,\r\nwent all wrong. She was a washerwoman, and slaved herself to death. She\r\ndied in the house [workhouse] in Birmingham. I can read and write a\r\nlittle. I was sent to a charity school, and when I was big enough I was\r\nput ’prentice to a gunsmith at Birmingham. I’m master of the business\r\ngenerally, but my perticler part is a gun lock-filer. No, sir, I can’t\r\nsay as ever I liked it; nothing but file file all day. I used to wish I\r\nwas like the free bits o’ boys that used to beg steel filings of me for\r\ntheir fifth of November fireworks. I never could bear confinement. It’s\r\nmade me look older than I ought, I know, but what can a poor man do?\r\nNo, I never cared much about drinking. I worked in an iron-foundry when\r\nI was out of my time. I had a relation that was foreman there. Perhaps\r\nit might be that, among all the dust and heat and smoke and stuff, that\r\nmade me a sweep at last, for I was then almost or quite as black as a\r\nsweep.\r\n\r\n“Then I come up to London; ay, that must be more nor 20 years back.\r\nO, I came up to better myself, but I couldn’t get work either at the\r\ngun-makers--and I fancy the London masters don’t like Birmingham\r\nhands--nor at the iron-foundries, and the iron-foundries is nothing in\r\nLondon to what they is in Staffordshire and Warwickshire; nothing at\r\nall, they may say what they like. Well, sir, I soon got very bad off.\r\nMy togs was hardly to call togs. One night--and it was a coldish night,\r\ntoo--I slept in the park, and was all stiff and shivery next morning.\r\nAs I was wandering about near the park, I walked up a street near the\r\nAbbey--King-street, I think it is--and there was a picture outside a\r\npublic-house, and a writing of men wanted for the East India Company’s\r\nService. I went there again in the evening, and there was soldiers\r\nsmoking and drinking up and down, and I ’listed at once. I was to have\r\nmy full bounty when I got to the depôt--Southampton I think they called\r\nit. Somehow I began to rue what I’d done. Well, I hardly can tell you\r\nwhy. O, no; I don’t say I was badly used; not at all. But I had heard\r\nof snakes and things in the parts I was going to, and I gently hooked\r\nit. I was a navvy on different rails after that, but I never was strong\r\nenough for that there work, and at last I couldn’t get any more work\r\nto do. I came back to London; well, sir, I can’t say, as you ask, why\r\nI came to London ’stead of Birmingham. I seemed to go natural like. I\r\ncould get nothing to do, and Lord! what I suffered! I once fell down in\r\nthe Cut from hunger, and I was lifted into Watchorn’s, and he said to\r\nhis men, ‘Give the poor fellow a little drop of brandy, and after that\r\na biscuit; the best things he can have.’ He saved my life, sir. The\r\npeople at the bar--they see’d it was no humbug--gathered 7-1/2_d._ for\r\nme. A penny a-piece from some of Maudslay’s men, and a halfpenny from\r\na gent that hadn’t no other change, and a poor woman as I was going\r\naway slipt a couple of trotters into my hand.\r\n\r\n“I slept at a lodging-house, then, in Baldwin’s-gardens when I had\r\nmoney, and one day in Gray’s inn-lane I picked up an old gent that fell\r\nin the middle of the street, and might have been run over. After he’d\r\nfelt in all his pockets, and found he was all right, he gave me 5_s._ I\r\nknew a sweep, for I sometimes slept in the same house, in King-street,\r\nDrury-lane; and he was sick, and was going to the big house. And he\r\ntold me all about his machines, that’s six or seven years back, and\r\nsaid if I’d pay 2_s._ 6_d._ down, and 2_s._ 6_d._ a week, if I couldn’t\r\npay more, I might have his machine for 20_s._ I took it at 17_s._\r\n6_d._, and paid him every farthing. That just kept him out of the\r\nhouse, but he died soon after.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ve been a sweep ever since. I’ve had to shift as well as I\r\ncould. I don’t know that I’m what you call a Nuller, or a Querier.\r\nWell, if I’m asked if I’m anybody’s man, I don’t like to say ‘no,’\r\nand I don’t like to say ‘yes;’ so I says nothing if I can help it.\r\nYes, I call at houses to ask if anything’s wanted. I’ve got a job that\r\nway sometimes. If they took me for anybody’s man, I can’t help that.\r\nI lodge with another sweep which is better off nor I am, and pay him\r\n2_s._ 9_d._ a week for a little stair-head place with a bed in it.\r\nI think I clear 7_s._ a week, one week with another, but that’s the\r\noutside. I never go to church or chapel. I’ve never got into the way\r\nof it. Besides, I wouldn’t be let in, I s’pose, in my togs. I’ve only\r\nmyself. I can’t say I much like what I’m doing, but what can a poor man\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SWEEPS’ HOME.\r\n\r\n(_From a sketch taken on the spot._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE FIRES OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nConnected with the subject of chimney sweeping is one which attracts\r\nfar less of the attention of the legislature and the public than its\r\nimportance would seem to demand: I mean the fires in the metropolis,\r\nwith their long train of calamities, such as the loss of life and\r\nof property. These calamities, too, especially as regards the loss\r\nof property, are almost all endured by the poor, the destruction of\r\nwhose furniture is often the destruction of their whole property, as\r\ninsurances are rarely effected by them; while the wealthier classes, in\r\nthe case of fires, are not exposed to the evils of houselessness, and\r\nmay be actually gainers by the conflagration, through the sum for which\r\nthe property was insured.\r\n\r\n“The daily occurrence of fires in the metropolis,” say the Board\r\nof Health, “their extent, the number of persons who perish by\r\nthem, the enormous loss of property they occasion, the prevalence\r\nof incendiarism, the apparent apathy with which such calamities\r\nare regarded, and the rapidity with which they are forgotten, will\r\nhereafter be referred to as evidence of a very low social condition\r\nand defective administrative organization. These fires, it was shown\r\nnearly a century ago, when the subject of insurance was debated in\r\nParliament, were frequently caused from not having chimneys swept\r\nin proper time.” I am informed that a chimney may be on fire for many\r\ndays, unknown to the inmates of the house, and finally break out in\r\nthe body of the building by its getting into contact with some beam or\r\nwood-work. The recent burning of Limehouse Church was occasioned by the\r\nsoot collected in the flue taking fire, and becoming red hot, when it\r\nignited the wood-work in the roof. The flue, or pipe, was of iron.\r\n\r\nFrom a return made by Mr. Braidwood of the houses and properties\r\ndestroyed in the metropolis in the three years ending in 1849\r\ninclusive, it appears that the total number was 1111: of contents\r\ndestroyed (which, being generally insured separately, should be kept\r\ndistinct) there were 1013. The subjoined table gives the particulars as\r\nto the proportion insured and uninsured:--\r\n\r\n  -------------+---------+----------+------\r\n    --         | Insured.|Uninsured.|Total.\r\n  -------------+---------+----------+------\r\n  Houses       |     914 |      197 | 1111\r\n  Contents     |     609 |      404 | 1013\r\n  -------------+---------+----------+------\r\n               |    1523 |      601 | 2124\r\n  -------------+---------+----------+------\r\n\r\n“The proportion per cent. of the uninsured to the insured, would be--\r\n\r\n  --------+----+---------+----------+------\r\n    --    |    | Insured.|Uninsured.|Total.\r\n  --------+----+---------+----------+------\r\n          |    |Per Cent.| Per Cent.|\r\n  Houses  |1111|    82·3 |     17·7 |  100\r\n  Contents|1013|    60·1 |     39·9 |  100\r\n  --------+----+---------+----------+------\r\n          |2124|    71·7 |     28·3 |  100\r\n  --------+----+---------+----------+------\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the total number of fires in the metropolis\r\nduring a series of years:\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACT OF CAUSES OF FIRE IN THE METROPOLIS, FROM 1833 to 1849,\r\nINCLUSIVE.\r\n\r\nCOMPILED BY W.

665\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find that while the greatest proportion of fires are\r\ncaused by accidents with candles, about one-ninth of the fires above\r\nmentioned arise from foul flues, or 75 out of 665, a circumstance which\r\nteaches us the usefulness of the class of labourers of whom we have\r\nbeen lately treating.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that a much larger proportion of the fires are wilfully\r\nproduced than appear in the above table.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Health, in speaking of incendiarism in connection with\r\ninsurance, report:--\r\n\r\n“Inquiries connected with measures for the improvement of the\r\npopulation have developed the operation of insurances, in\r\nengendering crimes and calamities; negatively, by weakening natural\r\nresponsibilities and motives to care and forethought; positively, by\r\ntemptations held out to the commission of crime in the facility with\r\nwhich insurance money is usually obtainable.\r\n\r\n“The _steady increase_ in the number of fires in the metropolis, whilst\r\nour advance in the arts gives means for their diminution, is ascribable\r\nmainly to the operation of these two causes, and to the division and\r\nweakening of administrative authority. From information on which we\r\ncan rely, we feel assured that the crime of incendiarism for the sake\r\nof insurance money exists to a far greater extent than the public are\r\naware of.”\r\n\r\nMr. Braidwood has expressed his opinion that only one-half of the\r\nproperty in the metropolis is insured, not as to numbers of property,\r\nbut as to value; but the proportion of insured and uninsured houses\r\ncould not be ascertained.\r\n\r\nMr. Baddeley, the inspector to the Society for the Protection of Life\r\nfrom Fire, who had given attention to the subject for the last 30\r\nyears, gave the Board the following account of the increase of fires:--\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n                    |           |          |Proportion\r\n                    | Fires per | Of which | per Cent.\r\n                    |  Annum of |   were   |of Insured\r\n                    |Houses and | Totally  |Houses and\r\n                    |Properties.|Uninsured.|Properties\r\n                    |           |          |   Burnt.\r\n  ------------------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n  In the first seven|           |          |\r\n  years there were  |           |          |\r\n  on an average     |    623    |    215   |   65·15\r\n                    |           |          |\r\n  In the second     |           |          |\r\n  seven years       |    790    |    244   |   69·3\r\n  ------------------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nDuring this period there has been a great increase in the number of\r\ndwellings, but this has been chiefly in suburban places, where fires\r\nrarely occur.\r\n\r\n“The frequency of fires,” it is further stated, “led Mr. Payne, the\r\ncoroner of the City of London, to revive the exercise of the coroner’s\r\nfunction of inquiring into the causes of fires; most usefully. Out\r\nof 58 inquests held by him (in the City of London and the borough of\r\nSouthwark, which comprise only one-eighteenth of the houses of the\r\nmetropolis) since 1845, it appears that, 8 were proved to be wilful; 27\r\napparently accidental; and 23 from causes unknown, including suspicious\r\ncauses. The proportion of ascertained wilful fires was, therefore, 23\r\nper cent.; which gives strong confirmation to the indications presented\r\nby the statistical returns as to the excess of insured property burnt\r\nabove uninsured.”\r\n\r\nThe at once mean and reckless criminality of arson, by which a man\r\nexposes his neighbours to the risk of a dreadful death, which he\r\nhimself takes measures to avoid, has long, and on many occasions, gone\r\nunpunished in London. The insurance companies, when a demand is made\r\nupon them for a loss through fire, institute an inquiry, carried on\r\nquietly by their own people. The claimant is informed, if sufficient\r\nreasons for such a step appear, that from suspicious circumstances,\r\nwhich had come to the knowledge of the company, the demand would not\r\nbe complied with, and that the company would resist any action for\r\nthe recovery of the money. The criminal becomes alarmed, he is afraid\r\nof committing himself, and so the matter drops, and the insurance\r\ncompanies, not being required to pay the indemnification, are satisfied\r\nto save their money, and let the incendiarism remain unnoticed or\r\nunpunished. Mr. Payne, the coroner, has on some occasions strongly\r\ncommented on this practice as one which showed the want of a public\r\nprosecutor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few words as regards the means of extinction and help at fires.\r\n\r\nUpwards of two years ago the Commissioners of Police instructed their\r\nofficers to note the time which elapsed between the earliest alarm\r\nof fire and the arrival of the first engine. Seventeen fires were\r\nnoted, and the average duration of time before the fire-brigade or any\r\nparochial or local fire-engine, reached the spot, was 36 minutes. Two\r\nor three of these fires were in the suburbs; so that in this crowded\r\ncity, so densely packed with houses and people, fifteen fires raged\r\nunchecked for more than half-an-hour.\r\n\r\nThere are in the metropolis, not including the more distant suburbs,\r\n150 public fire stations, with engines provided under the management of\r\nthe parochial authorities. The fire-brigade has but seventeen stations\r\non land, and two on the river, which are, indeed, floating engines, one\r\nbeing usually moored near Southwark-bridge, the other having no stated\r\nplace, being changed in its locality, as may be considered best. In the\r\ncourse of three years, the term of the official inquiry, the engines\r\nof the fire-brigade reached on the average the place where a fire was\r\nraging _thirty-five_ times as the earliest means of assistance, when\r\nthe parochial engines did the same only in the proportion of _two_ to\r\nthe thirty-five.\r\n\r\nMr. Braidwood, the director of the fire-brigade, stated, when\r\nquestioned on the subject with a view to a report to be laid before\r\nParliament, that “the average time of an engine turning out with horses\r\nwas from three to seven minutes.” The engines are driven at the rate of\r\nten miles an hour along the streets, which, in the old coaching days,\r\nwas considered the “best royal mail pace.” Indeed, there have been\r\nfrequent complaints of the rapidity with which the fire-engines are\r\ndriven, and if the drivers were not skilful and alert, it would really\r\namount to recklessness.\r\n\r\n“Information of the breaking out of a fire,” it is stated in the\r\nreport, “will be conveyed to the station of the brigade at the rate of\r\nabout five miles an hour: thus in the case of the occurrence of a fire\r\nwithin a mile of the station, the intelligence may be conveyed to the\r\nstation in about twelve minutes; the horses will be put to, and the\r\nengine got out into the street in about five minutes on the average; it\r\ntraverses the mile in about six minutes; and the water has to be got\r\ninto the engine, which will occupy about five minutes, making, under\r\nthe most favourable circumstances for such a distance, 28 minutes, or\r\nfor a half-mile distance, an average of not less than 20 minutes.”\r\n\r\nThe average distance of the occurring fires from a brigade station\r\nwere, however, during a period of three years, terminating in 1850,\r\nupwards of a mile. One was five miles, several four miles, more were\r\ntwo miles, and a mile and a half, while the most destructive fires\r\nwere at an average distance of a mile and three quarters. Thus it was\r\nimpossible for a fire-brigade to give assistance as soon as assistance\r\nwas needed, and, under other circumstances, might have been rendered.\r\nAnd all this damage may and does very often result from what seems so\r\ntrifling a neglect as the non-sweeping of a chimney.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Baddeley, an engineer, and a high authority on this subject, has\r\nstated that he had attended fires for 30 years in London, and that, of\r\n838 fires which took place in 1849, two-thirds might have been easily\r\nextinguished had there been an immediate application of water. In some\r\nplaces, he said, delay originated from the turn-cocks being at wide\r\nintervals, and some of the companies objecting to let any but their\r\nown servants have the command of the main-cocks.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Health have recommended the formation of a series of\r\nstreet-water plugs within short distances of each other, the water to\r\nbe constantly on at high pressure night and day, and the whole to be\r\nunder the charge of a trained body of men such as compose the present\r\nfire-brigade, provided at appointed stations with every necessary\r\nappliance in the way of hose, pipes, ladders, &c. “The hose should be\r\nwithin the reach,” it is urged in the report, “fixed, and applied on\r\nan average of not more than five minutes from the time of the alarm\r\nbeing given; that is to say, in less than one-fourth of the time within\r\nwhich fire-engines are brought to bear under existing arrangements,\r\nand with a still greater proportionate diminution of risks and serious\r\naccidents.”\r\n\r\nNor is this mode of extinguishing fires a mere experiment. It is\r\nsuccessfully practised in some of the American cities, Philadelphia\r\namong the number, and in some of our own manufacturing towns. Mr.\r\nEmmott, the engineer and manager of the Oldham Water-works, has\r\ndescribed the practice in that town on the occurrence of fires:--\r\n\r\n“In five cases out of six, the hose is pushed into a water-plug, and\r\nthe water thrown upon a building on fire, for the average pressure of\r\nwater in this town is 146 feet; by this means our fires are generally\r\nextinguished even before the heavy engine arrives at the spot. The hose\r\nis much preferred to the engine, on account of the speed with which it\r\nis applied, and the readiness with which it is used, for one man can\r\nmanage a hose, and throw as much water on the building on fire as an\r\nengine worked by many men. On this account we very rarely indeed use\r\nthe engines, as they possess no advantage whatever over the hose.”\r\n\r\nWhen the city of Hamburgh was rebuilt two or three years back, after\r\nits destruction by fire, it was rebuilt chiefly under the direction\r\nof Mr. W. Lindley, the engineer, and, as far as Mr. Lindley could\r\naccomplish, on sanitary principles, such as the abolition of cesspools.\r\nThe arrangements for the surface cleansing of the streets by means\r\nof the hose and jet and the water-plugs, are made available for the\r\nextinction of fires, and with the following results, as communicated by\r\nMr. Lindley:--\r\n\r\n“Have there been fires in buildings in Hamburgh in the portion of the\r\ntown rebuilt?--Yes, repeatedly. They have all, however, been put out\r\nat once. If they had had to wait the usual time for engines and water,\r\nsay 20 minutes or half an hour, these might all have led to extensive\r\nconflagrations.\r\n\r\n“What has been the effect on insurance?--The effect of the rapid\r\nextinction of fires has brought to light to the citizens of Hamburgh,\r\nthe fact that the greater proportion of their fires are the work of\r\nincendiaries, for the sake of the insurance money. A person is absent;\r\nsmoke is seen to exude; the alarm of fire is given, and the door is\r\nforced open, the jet applied, and the fire extinguished immediately.\r\nCase after case has occurred, where, upon the fire being extinguished,\r\nthe arrangements for the spread of the fire are found and made\r\nmanifest. Several of this class of incendiaries for the insurance\r\nmoney are now in prison. The saving of money alone, by the prevention\r\nof fires, would be worth the whole expense of the like arrangement\r\nin London, where it is well known that similar practices prevail\r\nextensively.”\r\n\r\nThe following statement was given by Mr. Quick, an engineer, on this\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n“After the destruction of the terminus of the South Western Railway by\r\nfire, I recommended them to have a 9-inch main, with 3-inch outlets\r\nleading to six stand-pipes, with joining screws for hose-pipes to\r\nbe attached, and that they should carry a 3-inch pipe of the same\r\ndescription up into each floor, so that a hose might be attached in any\r\nroom where the fire commenced.\r\n\r\n“In how many minutes may the hose be attached?--There is only the time\r\nof attaching the hose, which need be nothing like a minute. I have\r\nindeed recommended that a short length of hose with a short nozzle or\r\nbranch should be kept attached to the cock, so that the cock has only\r\nto be turned, which is done in an instant.\r\n\r\n“It appears that fire-engines require 26 men to work each engine of two\r\n7 inch barrels, to produce a jet of about 50 feet high. The arrangement\r\ncarried out, at your recommendation, with six jets, is equivalent to\r\nkeeping six such engines, and the power of 156 men, in readiness to\r\nact at all times, night and day, at about a minute’s notice, for the\r\nextinction of fires?--It will give a power more than equal to that\r\nnumber of men; for the jets given off from a 20-inch main will be much\r\nmore regular and powerful, and will deliver more water than could be\r\ndelivered by any engine. The jets at that place would be 70 feet high.”\r\n\r\nThe system of roof-cisterns, which was at one time popular as a means\r\nof extinction, has been found, it appears, on account of their leakage\r\nand diffusion of damp, to be but sorry contrivances, and have very\r\ngenerally been discontinued. Mr. Holme, a builder in Liverpool, gives\r\nthe following, even under the circumstances, amusing account of a fire\r\nwhere such a cistern was provided:--\r\n\r\n“The owner of a cotton kiln, which had been repeatedly burnt, took it\r\ninto his head to erect a large tank in the roof. His idea was, that\r\nwhen a fire occurred, they should have water at hand; and when the\r\nfire ascended, it would burn the wooden tank, and the whole of the\r\ncontents being discharged on the fire like a cataract, it would at\r\nonce extinguish it. Well, the kiln again took fire; the smoke was so\r\nsuffocating, that nobody could get at the internal pipe, and the whole\r\nbuilding was again destroyed. But what became of the tank? It could not\r\nburn, because it was filled with water; consequently, it boiled most\r\nadmirably. No hole was singed in its side or bottom; it looked very\r\npicturesque, but it was utterly useless.”\r\n\r\nThe necessity of almost immediate help is shown in the following\r\nstatement by Mr. Braidwood, when consulted on the subject of\r\nfire-escapes, which under the present system are not considered\r\nsufficiently effective:--\r\n\r\n“Taking London to be six miles long and three miles broad, to have\r\nanything like an efficient system of fire-escapes, it would be\r\nnecessary to have one with a man to attend it within a quarter of a\r\nmile of each house, as assistance, to be _of any use, must generally\r\nbe rendered within five minutes after the alarm is given_. To do this\r\nthe stations must be within a quarter of a mile of each other (as the\r\nescapes must be taken round the angles of the streets): 253 stations\r\nwould thus be required and as many men.\r\n\r\n“At present scaling ladders are kept at all the engine stations, and\r\ncanvas sheets also at some of them; several lives have been saved by\r\nthem; but the distance of the stations from each other renders them\r\napplicable only in a limited number of instances.”\r\n\r\nThe engines of the fire-brigade throw up about 90 gallons a minute.\r\nTheir number is about 100. The cost of a fire-engine is from 60_l._ to\r\n100_l._, and the hose, buckets, and general apparatus, cost nearly the\r\nsame amount.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SEWERMEN AND NIGHTMEN OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the consideration of the last of the several classes\r\nof labourers engaged in the removal of the species of refuse from\r\nthe metropolis. I have before said that the public refuse of a town\r\nconsists of two kinds:--\r\n\r\n  I. The street-refuse.\r\n  II. The house-refuse.\r\n\r\nOf each of these kinds there are two species:--\r\n\r\n  A. The dry.\r\n  B. The wet.\r\n\r\nThe dry street-refuse consists, as we have seen, of the refuse earth,\r\nbricks, mortar, oyster-shells, potsherds, and pansherds.\r\n\r\nAnd the dry house-refuse of the soot and ashes of our fires.\r\n\r\nThe wet street-refuse consists, on the other hand, of the mud, slop,\r\nand surface water of our public thoroughfares.\r\n\r\nAnd the wet house-refuse, of what is familiarly known as the “slops”\r\nof our residences, and the liquid refuse of our factories and\r\nslaughterhouses.\r\n\r\nWe have already collected the facts in connection with the three first\r\nof these subjects. We have ascertained the total amount of each of\r\nthese species of refuse which have to be annually removed from the\r\ncapital. We have set forth the aggregate number of labourers who are\r\nengaged in the removal of it, as well as the gross sum that is paid\r\nfor so doing, showing the individual earnings of each of the workmen,\r\nand arriving, as near as possible, at the profits of their employers,\r\nas well as the condition of the employed. This has been done, it is\r\nbelieved, for the first time in this country; and if the subject has\r\nled us into longer discussions than usual, the importance of the\r\nmatter, considered in a sanitary point of view, is such that a moment’s\r\nreflection will convince us of the value of the inquiry--especially\r\nin connection with a work which aspires to embrace the whole of the\r\noffices performed by the labourers of the capital of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nIt now but remains for us to complete this novel and vast inquiry by\r\nsettling the condition and earnings of the men engaged in the removal\r\nof the last species of public refuse. I shall consider, first, the\r\naggregate quantity of wet house-refuse that has to be annually removed;\r\nsecondly, the means adopted for the removal of it; thirdly, the cost of\r\nso doing; and lastly, the number of men engaged in this kind of work,\r\nas well as the wages paid to them, and the physical, intellectual, and\r\nmoral condition in which they exist, or, more properly speaking, are\r\nallowed to remain.\r\n\r\nOF THE WET HOUSE-REFUSE OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nAll house-refuse of a liquid or semi-liquid character is _wet_ refuse.\r\nIt may be called semi-liquid when it has become mingled with any\r\nsolid substance, though not so fully as to have lost its property of\r\nfluidity, its natural power to flow along a suitable inclination.\r\n\r\nWet house-refuse consists of the “slops” of a household. It consists,\r\nindeed, of _all_ waste water, whether from the supply of the water\r\ncompanies, or from the rain-fall collected on the roofs or yards of the\r\nhouses; of the “suds” of the washerwomen, and the water used in every\r\ndepartment of scouring, cleansing, or cooking. It consists, moreover,\r\nof the refuse proceeds from the several factories, dye-houses, &c.; of\r\nthe blood and other refuse (not devoted to Prussian blue manufacture or\r\nsugar refining) from the butchers’ slaughter-houses and the knackers’\r\n(horse slaughterers’) yards; as well as the refuse fluid from all\r\nchemical processes, quantities of chemically impregnated water, for\r\nexample, being pumped, as soon as exhausted, from the tan-pits of\r\nBermondsey into the drains and sewers. From the great hat-manufactories\r\n(chiefly also in Bermondsey and other parts of the Borough) there is a\r\nconstant flow of water mixed with dyes and other substances, to add to\r\nthe wet refuse of London.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that _all_ the water consumed or wasted in the\r\nmetropolis must form a portion of the total sum of the wet refuse.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, the exception of what is used for the watering\r\nof gardens, which is absorbed at once by the soil and its vegetable\r\nproducts; we must also exclude such portion of water as is applied to\r\nthe laying of the road and street dust on dry summer days, and which\r\nforms a part of the street mud or “mac” of the scavager’s cart, rather\r\nthan of the sewerage; and we must further deduct the water derived from\r\nthe street plugs for the supply of the fire-engines, which is consumed\r\nor absorbed in the extinction of the flames; as well as the water\r\nrequired for the victualling of ships on the eve of a voyage, when\r\nsuch supply is not derived immediately from the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water required for the diet, or beverage, or general\r\nuse of the population; the quantity consumed by the maltsters,\r\ndistillers, brewers, ginger-beer and soda-water makers, and\r\nmanufacturing chemists; for the making of tea, coffee, or cocoa; and\r\nfor drinking at meals (which is often derived from pumps, and not\r\nfrom the supplies of the water companies);--the water which is thus\r\nconsumed, in a prepared or in a simple state, passes into the wet\r\nrefuse of the metropolis in another form.\r\n\r\nNow, according to reports submitted to Parliament when an improved\r\nsystem of water-supply was under consideration, the daily supply of\r\nwater to the metropolis is as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                  Gallons.\r\n  From the Water Companies       44,383,329\r\n    „   „  Artesian Wells         8,000,000\r\n    „   „  land spring pumps      3,000,000\r\n                                 ----------\r\n                                 55,383,329\r\n\r\nThe yearly rain-fall throughout the area of the metropolis is\r\n172,053,477 tons, or 33,589,972,120 gallons, 2 feet deep of rain\r\nfalling on every square inch of London in the course of the year. The\r\nyearly total of the water pumped or falling into the metropolis is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                   Gallons.\r\n  Yearly mechanical supply      19,215,000,000\r\n    „    natural ditto          38,539,972,122\r\n                                --------------\r\n                                57,754,972,122\r\n\r\nThe reader will find the details of this subject at p. 203 of the\r\npresent volume. I recapitulate the results here to save the trouble of\r\nreference, and briefly to present the question under one head.\r\n\r\nOf course the rain which ultimately forms a portion of the gross\r\nwet refuse of London, can be only such as falls on that part of the\r\nmetropolitan area which is occupied by buildings or streets. What falls\r\nupon fields, gardens, and all open ground, is absorbed by the soil.\r\nBut a large proportion of the rain falling upon the streets, is either\r\nabsorbed by the dry dust, or retained in the form of mud; hence that\r\nonly which falls on the house-tops and yards can be said to contribute\r\nlargely to the gross quantity of wet refuse poured into the sewers. The\r\nstreets of London appear to occupy one-tenth of the entire metropolitan\r\narea, and the houses (estimating 300,000 as occupying upon an average\r\n100 square yards each[62]) another tithe of the surface. The remaining\r\n92 square miles out of the 115 now included in the Registrar-General’s\r\nlimits (which extend, it should be remembered, to Wandsworth, Lewisham,\r\nBow, and Hampstead), may be said to be made up of suburban gardens,\r\nfields, parks, &c., where the rain-water would soak into the earth. We\r\nhave, then, only two-tenths of the gross rain-fall, or 7,700,000,000\r\ngallons, that could possibly appear in the sewers, and calculating\r\none-third of this to be absorbed by the mud and dust of the streets, we\r\ncome to the conclusion that the total quantity of rain-water entering\r\nthe sewers is, in round numbers, 5,000,000,000 gallons per annum.\r\n\r\nReckoning, therefore, 5,000,000,000 gallons to be derived from the\r\nannual rain-fall, it appears that the yearly supply of water, from all\r\nsources, to be accounted for among the wet house-refuse is, in round\r\nnumbers, 24,000,000,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe refuse water from the factories need not be calculated separately,\r\nas its supply is included in the water mechanically supplied, and the\r\nloss from evaporation in boiling, &c., would be perfectly insignificant\r\nif deducted from the vast annual supply, but 350,000,000 gallons have\r\nbeen allowed for this and other losses.\r\n\r\nThere is still another source of the supply of wet house-refuse\r\nunconnected either with the rain-fall or the mechanical supply of\r\nwater--I mean such proportion of the blood or other refuse from the\r\nbutchers’ and knackers’ premises as is washed into the sewers.\r\n\r\nOfficial returns show that the yearly quantity of animals sold in\r\nSmithfield is--\r\n\r\n  Horned cattle      224,000\r\n  Sheep            1,550,000\r\n  Calves              27,300\r\n  Pigs                40,000\r\n                   ---------\r\n                   1,841,300\r\n\r\nThe blood flowing from a slaughtered bullock, whether killed according\r\nto the Christian or the Jewish fashion, amounts, on an average, to\r\n20 quarts; from a sheep, to 6 or 7 quarts; from a pig, 5 quarts; and\r\nthe same quantity from a calf. The blood from a horse slaughtered in\r\na knackers’ yard is about the same as that from a bullock. This blood\r\nused to bring far higher prices to the butcher than can be now realized.\r\n\r\nIn the evidence taken by a Select Committee of the House of Commons\r\nin 1849, concerning Smithfield-market, Mr. Wyld, of the Fox and\r\nKnot-yard, Smithfield, stated that he slaughtered about 180 cattle\r\nweekly. “We have a sort of well made in the slaughterhouse,” he said,\r\n“which receives the blood. I receive about 1l. a week for it; it goes\r\ntwice a day to Mr. Ton’s, at Bow Common. We used to receive a good\r\ndeal more for it.” Even the market for blood at Mr. Ton’s, is, I am\r\ninformed, now done away with. He was a manufacturer of artificial\r\nmanure, a preparation of night-soil, blood, &c., baked in what may be\r\ncalled “cakes,” and exported chiefly to our sugar-growing colonies, for\r\nmanure. His manure yard has been suppressed.\r\n\r\nI am assured, on the authority of experienced butchers, that at\r\nthe present time fully three-fourths of the blood from the animals\r\nslaughtered in London becomes a component part of the wet refuse\r\nI treat of, being washed into the sewers. The more wholesale\r\nslaughterers, now that blood is of little value (9 gallons in\r\nWhitechapel-market, the blood of two beasts--less by a gallon--can be\r\nbought for 3_d._), send this animal refuse down the drains of their\r\npremises in far greater quantities than was formerly their custom.\r\n\r\nNow, reckoning only three-fourths of the blood from the cattle\r\nslaughtered in the metropolis, to find its way into the sewers, we\r\nhave, according to the numbers above given, the following yearly\r\nsupply:--\r\n\r\n                         Gallons.\r\n  From horned cattle      840,000\r\n   „   sheep            1,743,000\r\n   „   pigs                37,500\r\n   „   calves              25,590\r\n                        ---------\r\n                        2,646,090\r\n\r\nThis is merely the blood from the animals sold in Smithfield-market,\r\nthe lambs not being included in the return; while a great many pigs and\r\ncalves are slaughtered by the London tradesmen, without their having\r\nbeen shown in Smithfield.\r\n\r\nThe ordure from a slaughtered bullock is, on an average, from 1/2 to\r\n3/4 cwt. Many beasts yield one cwt.; and cows “killed full of grass,”\r\nas much as two cwt. Of this excrementitious matter, I am informed,\r\nabout a fourth part is washed into the sewers. In sheep, calves, and\r\npigs, however, there is very little ordure when slaughtered, only 3 or\r\n4 lbs. in each as an average.\r\n\r\nOf the number of horses killed there is no official or published\r\naccount. One man familiar with the subject calculated it at 100 weekly.\r\n_All_ the blood from the knackers’ yards is, I am told, washed into the\r\nsewers; consequently its yearly amount will be 26,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nBut even this is not the whole of the wet house-refuse of London.\r\n\r\nThere are, in addition, the excreta of the inhabitants of the houses.\r\nThese are said to average 1/4 lb. daily per head, including men, women,\r\nand children.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated by Bousingault, and confirmed by Liebig, that each\r\nindividual produces 1/4 lb. of solid excrement and 1-1/4 lb. of\r\nliquid excrement per day, making 1-1/2 lb. each, or 150 lbs. per 100\r\nindividuals, of semi-liquid refuse from the water-closet. “But,” says\r\nthe Surveyor of the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers, “there is other\r\nrefuse resulting from culinary operations, to be conveyed through the\r\ndrains, and the whole may be about 250 lbs. for 100 persons.”\r\n\r\nThe more fluid part of this refuse, however, is included in the\r\nquantity of water before given, so that there remains only the more\r\nsolid excrementitious matter to add to the previous total. This,\r\nthen, is 1/4 lb. daily and individually; or from the metropolitan\r\npopulation of nearly 2,500,000 a daily supply of 600,000 lbs., rather\r\nmore than 267 tons; and a yearly aggregate for the whole metropolis of\r\n219,000,000 lbs., or very nearly about 100,000 tons.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing account, then, the following is shown to be\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Gross Quantity of the Wet House-Refuse of the Metropolis._\r\n\r\n                                          Gallons.          Lbs.\r\n  “Slops” and unabsorbed rain-water   24,000,000,000 = 240,000,000,000\r\n  Blood of beasts                      2,646,000 =          26,460,000\r\n      „    horses                         26,000 =             260,000\r\n  Excreta                                                  219,000,000\r\n  Dung of slaughtered cattle                                17,400,000\r\n                                      --------------   ---------------\r\n  Total                               24,002,657,000 = 240,263,120,000\r\n\r\nHence we may conclude that the more fluid portion of the wet\r\nhouse-refuse of London amounts to 24,000,000,000 gallons per annum;\r\nand that altogether it weighs, in round numbers, about 240,000,000,000\r\nlbs., or 100,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nAs these refuse products are not so much matters of trade or sale as\r\nother commodities, of course less attention has been given to them,\r\nin the commercial attributes of weight and admeasurement. I will\r\nendeavour, however, to present an uniform table of the whole great mass\r\nof metropolitan wet house-refuse in cubic inches.\r\n\r\nThe imperial standard gallon is of the capacity of 277·274 cubic\r\ninches; and estimating the solid excrement spoken of as the ordinary\r\nweight of earth, or of the soil of the land, at 18 cubic feet the ton,\r\nwe have the following result, calculating in round numbers:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wet House-Refuse of the Metropolis._\r\n\r\n  Liquid   24,000,000,000 gal. = 6,600,000,000,000 cub. in.\r\n  Solid           100,000 tons =     3,110,400,000    „\r\n\r\nThus, by this process of admeasurement, we find the\r\n\r\n  WET HOUSE-REFUSE } = 6,603,110,400,000 cubic in., or\r\n  OF LONDON        }       3,820,000,000 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nFigures best show the extent of this refuse, “inexpressible” to common\r\nappreciation “by numbers that have name.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MEANS OF REMOVING THE WET HOUSE-REFUSE.\r\n\r\nWhether this mass of filth be, zymotically, the cause of cholera,\r\nor whether it be (as cannot be questioned) a means of agricultural\r\nfertility, and therefore of national wealth, it _must_ be removed. I\r\nneed not dilate, in explaining a necessity which is obvious to every\r\nman with uncorrupted physical senses, and with the common moral sense\r\nof decency.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Paley,” it is said, in a recent Report to the Metropolitan\r\nCommission of Sewers, “gave to Burckhardt and other travellers a set of\r\ninstructions as to points of observation of the manners and conditions\r\nof the populations amongst whom they travelled. One of the leading\r\ninstructions was to observe how they disposed of their excreta, for\r\nwhat they did with that showed him what men were; he also inquired what\r\nstructure they had to answer the purpose of a privy, and what were\r\ntheir habits in respect to it. This information Dr. Paley desired,\r\nnot for popular use, but for himself, for he was accustomed to say,\r\nthat the facts connected with that topic gave him more information\r\nas to the real condition and civilisation of a population than most\r\npersons would be aware of. It would inform him of their real habits of\r\ncleanliness, of real decency, self-respect, and connected moral habits\r\nof high social importance. It would inform him of the real state of\r\npolice, and of local administration, and much of the general government.\r\n\r\n“The human ordure which defiles the churches, the bases of public\r\nedifices and works of art in Rome and Naples, and the Italian cities,\r\ngives more sure indications of the real moral and social position of\r\nthe Italian population than any impressions derived from the edifices\r\nand works of art themselves.\r\n\r\n“The subject, in relation to which the Jewish lawgiver gave most\r\nparticular directions, is one on which the serious attention and labour\r\nof public administrators may be claimed.”\r\n\r\nThe next question, is--_How_ is the wet house-refuse to be removed?\r\n\r\nThere are two ways:--\r\n\r\n 1. One is, to transport it to a river, or some powerfully current\r\n stream by a series of ducts.\r\n\r\n 2. The other is, to dig a hole in the neighbourhood of the house,\r\n there collect the wet refuse of the household, and when the hole or\r\n pit becomes full, remove the contents to some other part.\r\n\r\nIn London the most obvious means of getting rid of a nuisance is to\r\nconvey it into the Thames. Nor has this been done in London only. In\r\nParis the Seine is the receptacle of the sewage, but, comparatively, to\r\na much smaller extent than in London. The fæcal deposits accumulated\r\nin the houses of the French capital are drained into “fixed” and\r\n“moveable” cesspools. The contents of both these descriptions of\r\ncesspools (of which I shall give an account when I treat of the\r\ncesspool system) are removed periodically, under the direction of the\r\ngovernment, to large receptacles, called _voiries_, at Montfaucon, and\r\nthe Forest of Bondy, where such refuse is made into portable manure.\r\nThe evils of this system are not a few; but the river is spared the\r\ngreater pollution of the Thames. Neither is the Seine swayed by the\r\ntide as is the Thames, for in London the very sewers are affected by\r\nthe tidal influence, and are not to be entered until some time before\r\nor after high-water. I need not do more, for my present inquiry, than\r\nallude to the Liffy, the Clyde, the Humber, and others of the rivers of\r\nthe United Kingdom, being used for purposes of sewerage, as channels to\r\ncarry off that of which the law prohibits the retention.\r\n\r\nOf the folly, not to say wickedness, of this principle, there can be\r\nno doubt. The vegetation which gives, demands food. The grass will\r\nwither without its fitting nutriment of manure, as the sheep would\r\nperish without the pasturage of the grass. Nature, in temperate and\r\nmoist climates, is, so to speak, her own manurer, her own restorer. The\r\nsheep, which are as wild and active as goats, manure the Cumberland\r\nfells in which they feed. In the more cultivated sheep-walks (or,\r\nindeed, in the general pasturage) of the northern and some of the\r\nmidland counties, women, with a wooden implement, may be continually\r\nseen in the later autumn, or earlier and milder winter, distributing\r\nthe “stercoraceous treasure,” as Cowper calls it, which the animals, to\r\nuse the North Yorkshire word, have “dropped,” as well as any extraneous\r\nmanure which may have been spread for the purpose. As population and\r\nthe demand for bread increase, the need of extraneous manures also\r\nincreases; and Nature in her beneficence has provided that the greater\r\nthe consumption of food, the greater shall be the promoters of its\r\nreproduction by what is loathsome to man, but demanded by vegetation.\r\nLiebig, as I shall afterwards show more fully, contends that many an\r\narid and desolate region in the East, brown and burnt with barrenness,\r\nbecame a desolation because men understood not the restoration which\r\nall nature demands for the land. He declares that the now desolate\r\nregions of the East had been made desolate, because “the inhabitants\r\ndid not understand the art of restoring exhausted soil.” It would be\r\nhopeless now to form, or attempt to form, the “hanging gardens,” or to\r\ndisplay the rich florescence “round about Babylon,” to be seen when\r\nAlexander the Great died in that city. The Tigris and Euphrates, before\r\nand after their junction, Liebig maintains, have carried, and, to a\r\ncircumscribed degree, still carry, into the sea “a sufficient amount\r\nof manure for the reproduction of food for millions of human beings.”\r\nIt is said that, “could that matter only be arrested in its progress,\r\nand converted into bread and wine, fruit and beef, mutton and wool,\r\nlinen and cotton, then cities might flourish once more in the desert,\r\nwhere men are now digging for the relics of primitive civilization, and\r\ndiscovering the symbols of luxury and ease beneath the barren sand and\r\nthe sunburnt clay.”\r\n\r\nThis is one great evil; but in our metropolis there is a greater, a far\r\ngreater, beyond all in degree, even if the same abuse exist elsewhere.\r\nWhat society with one consent pronounces filth--the evacuations of\r\nthe human body--is not only washed into the Thames, and the land so\r\ndeprived of a vast amount of nutriment, but the tide washes these\r\nevacuations back again, with other abominations. The water we use is\r\nderived almost entirely from the Thames, and therefore the water in\r\nwhich we boil our vegetables and our meat, the water for our coffee and\r\ntea, the water brewed for our consumption, comes to us, and is imbibed\r\nby us, impregnated over and over again with our own animal offal. We\r\nimport guano, and drink a solution of our own fæces: a manure which\r\nmight be made far more valuable than the foreign guano.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few of the evils of making a common sewer of the\r\nneighbouring river.\r\n\r\nThe other mode of removal is, to convey the wet house-refuse, by\r\ndrains, to a hole near the house where it is produced, and empty it\r\nperiodically when full.\r\n\r\nThe house-drainage throughout London has two characteristics. By\r\none system all excrementitious and slop refuse generally is carried\r\nusually along brick drains from the water-closets, privies, sinks,\r\nlavatories, &c., of the houses into the cesspools, where it accumulates\r\nuntil its removal (by manual labour) becomes necessary, which is not,\r\nas an average, more than once in two years. By the other, and the\r\nnewer system, all the house-refuse is drained into the public sewer,\r\nthe cesspool system being thereby abolished. All the houses built or\r\nrebuilt since 1848 are constructed on the last-mentioned principle of\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\n The first of these modes is cesspoolage.\r\n\r\n The second is sewerage.\r\n\r\nI shall first deal with the sewerage of the metropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE QUANTITY OF METROPOLITAN SEWAGE.\r\n\r\nHaving estimated the gross quantity of wet house-refuse produced\r\nthroughout London in the course of the year, and explained the two\r\nmodes of removing it from the immediate vicinity of the house, I will\r\nnow proceed to set forth the _quantity_ of wet house-refuse matter\r\nwhich it has been _ascertained_ is removed with the contents of London\r\nsewers.\r\n\r\nAn experiment was made on the average discharge of sewage from the\r\noutlets of Church-lane and Smith-street, Chelsea, Ranelagh, King’s\r\nScholar’s-pond, Grosvenor-wharf, Horseferry-road, Wood-street,\r\nKing-street, Northumberland-street, Durham-yard, Norfolk-street,\r\nand Essex-street (the four last-mentioned places running from the\r\nStrand). The experiments were made “under ordinary and extraordinary\r\ncircumstances,” in the months of May, June, and July, 1844, but the\r\nsystem is still the same, so that the result in the investigation as\r\nto the sewage of the year 1844 may be taken as a near criterion of the\r\npresent, as regards the localities specified and the general quantity.\r\n\r\nThe surface drained into the outlets before enumerated covers, in its\r\ntotal area, about 7000 acres, of which nearly 3500 may be classed as\r\nurban. The observations, moreover, were made generally during fine\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nI cannot do better by way of showing the reader the minuteness with\r\nwhich these observations were made, than by quoting the two following\r\nresults, being those of the fullest and smallest discharges of twelve\r\nissues into the river. I must premise that these experiments were\r\nmade on seven occasions, from May 4 to July 12 inclusive, and made at\r\ndifferent times, but generally about eight hours after high water. In\r\nthe Northumberland-street sewer, from which was the largest issue, the\r\nwidth of the sewer at the outlet was five feet. In the King-street\r\nsewer (the smallest discharge, as given in the second table) the width\r\nof the sewer was four feet. The width, however, does not affect the\r\nquestion, as there was a greater issue from the Norfolk-street sewer of\r\ntwo feet, than from the King-street sewer of four feet in width.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------\r\n  |             NORTHUMBERLAND STREET.\r\n  +---------+-----------------+--------------------\r\n  |         |  Velocity per   | Quantity discharged\r\n  |  Date.  |    second.      |     per second.\r\n  +---------+-----------------+--------------------\r\n  |         |      Feet.      |     Cubic Feet.\r\n  |         +-----------------+--------------------\r\n  | May   4 |      4·600      |     10·511000\r\n  |  „    9 |      4·000      |      6·800000\r\n  | June  5 |      4·000      |      6·800000\r\n  |  „   10 |      4·600      |     10·350000\r\n  |  „   11 |      4·920      |     12·300000\r\n  |  „   16 |      3·600      |      5·940000\r\n  | July 12 |      2·760      |      3·394800\r\n  +---------+-----------------+--------------------\r\n  |         |                 |     56·095800\r\n  +---------+-----------------+--------------------\r\n  |   Being Mean Discharge    |\r\n  | per second                |      8·013685\r\n  |   Ditto per 24 hours      |        692382·\r\n  +---------------------------+--------------------\r\n  |                  KING STREET.\r\n  +---------+-----------------+--------------------\r\n  | May   4 |      ·147       |      ·021756\r\n  |  „    9 |      ·333       |      ·079920\r\n  | June  5 |      ·170       |      ·020400\r\n  |  „   10 |      ·311       |      ·064688\r\n  |  „   11 |      ·300       |      ·048000\r\n  |  „   16 |      ·101       |      ·004040\r\n  | July 12 |      ·103       |      ·008240\r\n  +---------+-----------------+--------------------\r\n  |         |                 |      ·247044\r\n  +---------+-----------------+--------------------\r\n  |Mean Discharge per second  |      ·035292\r\n  |   Ditto       per 24 hours|         3049·\r\n  +---------------------------+--------------------\r\n\r\nHere we find that the mean discharge per second was, from the\r\nNorthumberland-street sewer, 692,382· cubic feet per 24 hours, and from\r\nthe King-street sewer, 3049 cubic feet per 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThe discharge from the principal outlets in the Westminster district\r\n“being the mean of seven observations taken during the summer,” was\r\n1,798,094 cubic feet in 24 hours; the number of acres drained was 7006.\r\n_The mean discharge per acre, in the course of 24 hours, was found to\r\nbe about 256 cubic feet, comprising the urban and suburban parts._\r\n\r\nThe sewage, from the discharge of which this calculation was\r\nderived--and the dryness of the weather must not be lost sight of--may\r\nbe fairly assumed as derived (in a dry season) almost entirely from\r\nartificial sources or house drainage, as there was no rain-fall,\r\nor but little. “_Supposing, therefore_,” the Report states, “_the\r\nentire surface to be urban, we have 540 cubic feet as the mean daily\r\ndischarge per acre_. If, however, the average be taken of the first\r\neight outlets, viz., from Essex-street to Grosvenor-wharf inclusive,\r\nwhich drain a surface wholly urban, the result is 1260 cubic feet per\r\nacre in the 24 hours. This excess may be attributed to the number\r\nof manufactories, and the densely-populated nature of the locality\r\ndrained; but, as indicative of the general amount of sewage due to\r\nordinary urban districts, the former ought perhaps to be considered the\r\nfairer average.”\r\n\r\nIt is then assumed--I may say officially--that the average discharge\r\nof the urban and suburban sewage from the several districts included\r\nwithin an area of 58 square miles, is equal to 256 cubic feet per acre.\r\n\r\n                                          Sq. Miles.\r\n  The extent of the jurisdiction included\r\n  within this area is, on the north side of\r\n  the Thames                                  43\r\n  And on the Surrey and Kent side             15\r\n\r\n                                          Cubic Feet.\r\n  The ordinary _daily_ amount of\r\n  sewage discharged into the river on\r\n  the north side is, therefore            7,045,120\r\n  And on the south side                   2,457,600\r\n                                          ---------\r\n      Making a total of                   9,502,720\r\n\r\nOr a quantity equivalent to a surface of more than 36 acres in extent,\r\nand 6 feet in depth.\r\n\r\nThis mass of sewage, it must be borne in mind, is but the _daily_\r\nproduct of the sewage of the more populous part of the districts\r\nincluded within the jurisdiction of the two commissions of sewers.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing observations, calculations, and deductions have supplied\r\nthe basis of many scientific and commercial speculations, but it must\r\nbe remembered that they were taken between seven and eight years ago.\r\nThe observations were made, moreover, during fine summer weather,\r\ngenerally, while the greatest discharge is during rainy weather. There\r\nhas been, also, an increase of sewers in the metropolis, because an\r\nincrease of streets and inhabited houses. The approximate proportion\r\nof the increase of sewers (and there is no precise account of it) is\r\npretty nearly that of the streets, lineally. Another matter has too, of\r\nlate years, added to the amount of sewage--the abolition of cesspoolage\r\nin a considerable degree, owing to the late Building and Sanitary\r\nActs, so that fæcal and culinary matters, which were drained into the\r\ncesspool (to be removed by the nightmen), are now drained into the\r\nsewer. Altogether, I am assured, on good authority, the daily discharge\r\nof the sewers extending over 58 square miles of the metropolis may be\r\nnow put at 10,000,000 cubic feet, instead of rather more than nine and\r\na half millions. And this gives, as\r\n\r\n                                            Cubic Feet.\r\n  The annual amount of discharge\r\n  from the sewers                          3,650,000,000\r\n  The total amount of wet house-refuse,\r\n  according to the calculation\r\n  before given, is                         3,820,000,000\r\n                                           -------------\r\n      Hence there remains                    170,000,000\r\n\r\n                                             Sq. Miles.\r\n  Now it will be seen that the total area\r\n  from which this amount of sewage is said\r\n  to be drained is                               58\r\n  But the area of London, according to\r\n  the Registrar-General’s limits, is            115\r\n\r\nSo that the 3,650,000,000 cubic feet of sewage annually removed from\r\n58 square miles of the metropolis refer to only one-half of the entire\r\narea of the _true_ metropolis; but it refers, at the same time, to\r\nthat part of London which is the most crowded with houses, and since,\r\nin the suburbs, the buildings average about 2 to the acre, and, in\r\nthe densest parts of London, about 30, it is but fair to assume that\r\nthe refuse would be, at least, in the same proportion, and this is\r\nvery nearly the fact; for if we suppose the 58 miles of the suburban\r\ndistricts to yield twenty times less sewage than the 58 miles of the\r\nurban districts, we shall have 182,500,000 cubic feet to add to the\r\n3,650,000,000 cubic feet before given, or 3,832,500,000 for the sewage\r\nof the entire metropolis.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the sewage has ever been weighed so as to\r\ngive any definite result, but calculating from the weight of water (a\r\ngallon, or 10 lbs. of water, comprising 277·274 cubic inches, and 1 ton\r\nof liquid comprising 36 cubic feet) the total, from the returns of the\r\ninvestigation in 1844, would be\r\n\r\n                                                         Tons.\r\n  Quantity of sewage _daily_ emptied into the Thames    278,000\r\n  Ditto Annually                                    101,390,000\r\n\r\nIn September, 1849, Mr. Banfield, at one time a Commissioner of Sewers,\r\nput the yearly quantity of sewage discharged into the Thames at\r\n45,000,000 tons; but this is widely at variance with the returns as to\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF ANCIENT SEWERS.\r\n\r\nThe traverser of the London streets rarely thinks, perhaps, of the far\r\nextended subterranean architecture below his feet; yet such is indeed\r\nthe case, for the sewers of London, with all their imperfections,\r\nirregularities, and even absurdities, are still a great work; certainly\r\nnot equal, in all respects, to what once must have existed in Rome, but\r\nsecond, perhaps, only to the giant works of sewerage in the eternal\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe origin of these Roman sewers seems to be wrapped in as great a\r\nmystery as the foundation of the city itself. The statement of the\r\nRoman historians is that these sewers were the works of the elder\r\nTarquin, the fifth (apocryphal) king of Rome. Tarquin’s dominions,\r\nfrom the same accounts, did not in any direction extend above sixteen\r\nmiles, and his subjects could be but banditti, foragers, and shepherds.\r\nOne conjecture is, that Rome stands on the site of a more ancient\r\ncity, and that to its earlier possessors may be attributed the work\r\nof the sewers. To attribute them to the rudeness and small population\r\nof Tarquin’s day, it is contended, is as feasible as it would be to\r\nattribute the ruins of ancient Jerusalem, or any others in Asia Minor,\r\nto the Turks, or the ruins of Palmyra to the Arabs, because these\r\npeople enjoy the privilege of possession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SEWER-HUNTER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe main sewer of Rome, the Cloaca Maxima, is said to have been\r\nlofty and wide enough for a waggon load of hay to pass clear along\r\nit. Another, and more probable account, however, states that it was\r\nproposed to _enlarge_ the great sewer to these dimensions, but it does\r\nnot appear to have been so enlarged. Indeed, when Augustus “made\r\nRome marble,” it was one of his great works also, under the direction\r\nof Agrippa, to reconstruct, improve, and enlarge the sewers. It was a\r\nproject in the days of Rome’s greatness to turn seven navigable rivers\r\ninto vast subterraneous passages, larger sewers, along which barges\r\nmight pass, carrying on the traffic of Imperial Rome. In one year\r\nthe cost of cleansing, renewing, and repairing the sewers is stated\r\nto have been 1000 talents of gold, or upwards of 192,000_l._ Of the\r\n_average_ yearly cost we have no information. Some accounts represent\r\nthese sewers as having been rebuilt after the irruption of the Gauls.\r\nIn Livy’s time they were pronounced not to be accommodated to the plan\r\nof Rome. Some portions of these ancient structures are still extant,\r\nbut they seem to have attracted small notice even from professed\r\nantiquarians; their subterranean character, however, renders such\r\nnotice little possible. In two places they are still kept in repair,\r\nand for their original purpose, to carry off the filth of the city, but\r\nonly to a small extent.\r\n\r\nOur legislative enactments on the subject of sewers are ancient and\r\nnumerous. The oldest is that of 9 Henry III., and the principal is that\r\nof 23 Henry VIII., commonly called the “Statute of Sewers.” These and\r\nmany subsequent statutes, however, relate only to watercourses, and are\r\nsilent as regards my present topic--the Refuse of London.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how little is said in the London historians of\r\nthe _sewers_. In the two folio volumes of the most searching and\r\nindefatigable of all the antiquarians who have described the old\r\nmetropolis, John Stow, the tailor, there is no account of what we now\r\nconsider sewers, inclosed and subterranean channels for the conveyance\r\nof the refuse filth of the metropolis to its destination--the Thames.\r\nHad covered sewers been known, or at any rate been at all common, in\r\nStow’s day, and he died full of years in 1604, and had one of them\r\npresented but a crumbling stone with some heraldic, or apparently\r\nheraldic, device at its outlet, Stow’s industry would certainly have\r\nferreted out some details. Such, however, is not the case.\r\n\r\nThis absence of information I hold to be owing to the fact that no such\r\nsewers then existed. Our present system of sewerage, like our present\r\nsystem of street-lighting, is a modern work; but it is not, like our\r\ngas-lamps, an _original_ English work. We have but followed, as regards\r\nour arched and subterraneous sewerage, in the wake of Rome.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the early _laws_ of sewers relate to watercourses,\r\nnavigable communications, dams, ditches, and such like; there is no\r\ndoubt, however, that in the heart of the great towns the filth of the\r\nhouses was, by rude contrivances in the way of drainage, or natural\r\nfall, emptied into such places. Even in the accounts of the sewers of\r\nancient Rome, historians have stated that it is not easy, and sometimes\r\nnot possible, to distinguish between the _sewers_ and the _aqueducts_,\r\nand Dr. Lemon, in his English Etymology, speaks of sewers as a species\r\nof aqueducts. So, in some of our earlier Acts of Parliament, it is\r\nhardly possible to distinguish whether the provisions to be applied\r\nto the management of a sewer relate to a ditch to which house-filth\r\nwas carried--to a channel of water for general purposes--or to an open\r\nchannel being a receptacle of filth and a navigable stream at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThat the ditches were not sewers for the conveyance of the filth from\r\nthe houses to any very great, or rather any very general extent, may\r\nvery well be concluded, because (as I have shown in my account of the\r\nearly scavagers) the excrementitious matter was deposited during the\r\nnight in the street, and removed by the proper functionaries in the\r\nmorning, or as soon as suited their convenience. Though this was the\r\ncase generally, it is evident that the filth, or a portion of it,\r\nfrom the houses which were built on the banks of the Fleet River (as\r\nit was then called, as well as the Fleet Ditch), and on the banks of\r\nthe other “brooks,” drained into the current stream. The Corporation\r\naccounts contain very frequent mention of the cleansing, purifying,\r\nand “thorough” cleansing of the Fleet Ditch, the Old Bourne (Holborn\r\nBrook), the Wall Brook, &c.\r\n\r\nOf all these streams the most remarkable was Fleet Ditch, which was\r\nperhaps the first main sewer of London. I give from Stow the following\r\ncurious account of its origin. It is now open, but only for a short\r\ndistance, offending the air of Clerkenwell. At one period it was to\r\nafford a defence to the City! as the Tower-moat was a defence to the\r\nTower, and fortress.\r\n\r\n“The Ditch, which partly now remaineth and compassed the Wall of the\r\nCity, was begun to be made by the _Londoners_, in the year 1211, and\r\nfinished 1213, the 15th of K. _John_. This Ditch being then made of\r\n200 foot broad, caused no small hindrance to the Canons of the Holy\r\n_Trinity_, whose Church stood near _Ealdgate_, for that the said Ditch\r\npassed through their Ground from the _Tower_ unto _Bishopsgate_.\r\n\r\n“The first Occasion of making a Ditch about the City seems to have\r\nbeen this: _William_, Bishop of _Ely_, Chancellor of _England_, in the\r\nReign of King _Richard_ I., made a great Ditch round about the _Tower_,\r\nfor the better Defence of it against _John_ the King’s Brother, the\r\nKing being then out of the Realm. Then did the City also begin a Ditch\r\nto encompass and strengthen their Walls [which happened between the\r\nYears 1190 and 1193.] So the Book _Dunthorn_. Yet the Register of\r\n_Bermondsey_ writes that the Ditch was begun, Oct. 15, 1213, which was\r\nin the Reign of King _John_ that succeeded to _Richard_.\r\n\r\n“This Ditch being originally made for the Defence of the City, was\r\nalso a long time together carefully cleansed and maintained, as Need\r\nrequired; but now of late neglected, and forced either to a very\r\nnarrow, and the same a filthy Channel.\r\n\r\n“In the Year of _Christ_, 1354, 28 _Ed._ 3, the Ditch of this City\r\nflowing over the Bank into the _Tower-ditch_, the King commanded\r\nthe said Ditch of the City to be cleansed, and so ordered, that the\r\noverflowing thereof should not force any Filth into the _Tower-ditch_.\r\n\r\n“_Anno_, 1379, John Philpot, Maior of _London_, caused this Ditch to\r\nbe cleansed, and every Houshold to pay 5_d._, which was a Day’s Work\r\ntoward the Charges thereof.\r\n\r\n“_Ralph Joseline_, Maior, 1477, caused the whole Ditch to be cast\r\nand cleansed.... In 1519, the 10th of Henry 8, for cleansing and\r\nscouring the common Ditch, between _Aldgate_, and the Postern next\r\nthe _Tower-ditch_; the chief Ditcher had by the day 7_d._, the Second\r\nDitcher, 6_d._, the other Ditchers, 5_d._ And every Vagabond (for as\r\nthey were then termed) 1_d._ the Day, Meat and Drink, at the Charges of\r\nthe City. Sum 95_l._ 3_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n“Fleet Ditch was again cleansed in the Year 1549,” Stow continues,\r\n“_Henry Ancoates_ being Maior, at the Charges of the Companies. And\r\nagain 1569, the 11th of Queen _Elizabeth_; for cleansing the same Ditch\r\nbetween _Ealdgate_ and the _Postern_, and making a new Sewer and Wharf\r\nof Timber, from the Head of the _Postern_ into the _Tower-ditch_,\r\n814_l._ 15_s._ 8_d._ (was disbursed). Before the which Time the said\r\nDitch lay open, without either Wall or Pall, having therein great Store\r\nof very good Fish, of divers Sorts, as many men yet living, who have\r\ntaken and tasted them, can well witness. But now no such matter, the\r\nCharge of Cleansing is spared, and great Profit made by letting out the\r\nBanks, with the Spoil of the whole Ditch.”\r\n\r\nThe above information appeared, but I am unable to specify the year\r\n(for Stow’s works went through several editions, though it is to be\r\nfeared he died very poor) between 1582 and 1590. So did the following:--\r\n\r\n“At this Day there be no Ditches or Boggs in the City except the said\r\n_Fleet-ditch_, but instead thereof large common _Dreins_ and _Sewers_,\r\nmade to carry away the water from the _Postern-Gate_, between the two\r\n_Tower-hills_ to _Fleet-bridge_ without _Ludgate_.”\r\n\r\nGreat, indeed, is the change in the character of the capital of\r\nEngland, from the times when the Fleet Ditch was a defence to the city\r\n(which was then the entire capital); and from the later era, when\r\n“great store of very good fish of divers sorts,” rewarded the skill or\r\nthe patience of the anglers or netters; but this, it is evident, was in\r\nthe parts near the river (the Tower postern, &c.), and at that time, or\r\nabout that time, there was salmon-fishing in the Thames, at least as\r\nfar up as Hungerford Wharf.\r\n\r\nThe Fleet Ditch seems always to have had a _sewery_ character. It was\r\ndescribed, in 1728, as\r\n\r\n    “The king of dykes! than whom no sluice of mud\r\n    With deeper sable blots the silver flood--”\r\n\r\nthe _silver_ flood being, in Queen Anne’s and the First George’s days,\r\nthe London Thames. This silver has been much alloyed since that time.\r\n\r\nUntil within these 40 or 50 years, open sewer-ditches, into which\r\ndrains were emptied, and ordure and refuse thrown, were frequent,\r\nespecially in the remoter parts of Lambeth and Newington, and some\r\nexist to this day; one especially, open for a considerable distance,\r\nflowing along the back of the houses in the Westminster-road, on the\r\nright-hand side towards the bridge, into which the neighbouring houses\r\nare drained. The “Black Ditch,” a filthy sewer, until lately was open\r\nnear the Broadwall, and other vicinities of the Blackfriars-road. The\r\nopen ditch-sewers of Norwood and Wandsworth have often been spoken of\r\nin Sanitary Reports. Indeed, some of our present sewers, in addition to\r\nFleet River and Wall Brook, are merely ditches rudely arched over.\r\n\r\nThe first covered and continuous street sewer was erected in London--I\r\nthink, without doubt--when Wren rebuilt the capital, after the great\r\nfire of 1666. Perhaps there is no direct evidence of the fact, for,\r\nalthough the statutes and Privy Council and municipal enactments,\r\nconsequent on the rebuilding of the capital, required, more or less\r\nperemptorily, “fair sewers, and drains, and watercourses,” it is not\r\ndefined in these enactments what was meant by a “sewer;” nor were they\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nI may mention, as a further proof that open ditches, often enough\r\nstagnant ditches also, were the first London sewers, that, after 1666,\r\na plan, originally projected, it appears, by Sir Leonard Halliday,\r\nMaior, 60 years previously, and strenuously supported at that time by\r\nNic Leate, “a worthy and grave citizen,” was revived and reconsidered.\r\nThis project, for which Sir Leonard and Nic Leate “laboured much,” was\r\n“for a river to be brought on the north of the city into it, for the\r\ncleansing the sewers and ditches, and for the better keeping London\r\nwholesome, sweet, and clean.” An admirable _intention_; and it is not\r\nimpossible nor improbable that in less than two centuries hence, we, of\r\nthe present sanitary era, may be accounted, for our sanitary measures,\r\nas senseless as we now account good Sir Leonard Halliday and the worthy\r\nand grave Nic Leate. These gentlemen cared not to brook filth in\r\ntheir houses, nor to be annoyed by it in the nightly pollution of the\r\nstreets, but they advocated its injection into running water, and into\r\nwater often running slowly and difficultly, and continually under the\r\neyes and noses of the citizens. _We_, I apprehend, go a little further.\r\nWe drink, and use for the preparation of our meals, the befouled water,\r\nwhich they did not; for, more than seven-eighths of our water-supply\r\nfrom the companies is drawn from the Thames, the main sewer of the\r\ngreatest city in the world, ancient or modern, into which millions of\r\ntons of every description of refuse are swept yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE KINDS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF SEWERS.\r\n\r\nThe sewers of London may be arranged into two distinct\r\ngroups--according to the side of the Thames on which they are situate.\r\n\r\nNow the essential difference between these two classes of sewers lies\r\nin the elevation of the several localities whence the sewers carry the\r\nrefuse to the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe chief differences in the circumstances of the people north\r\nand south of the river are shown in the annexed table from the\r\nRegistrar-General’s returns:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                           |       | North | South\r\n                           |       |side of|side of\r\n                           |London.|  the  |  the\r\n                           |       | River.| River.\r\n  -------------------------+-------+-------+--------\r\n  Elevation of the ground, |       |       |\r\n  in feet, above Trinity   |       |       |\r\n  high-water mark          |   39  |   51  |  5\r\n                           |       |       |\r\n  Density, or number of    |       |       |\r\n  persons to an acre,      |       |       |\r\n  1849                     |   30  |   52  |  14\r\n                           |       |       |\r\n  Deaths from Cholera to   |       |       |\r\n  10,000 persons living,   |       |       |\r\n  in 60 weeks, ending      |       |       |\r\n  Nov. 24, 1849            |   66  |   44  |  127\r\n                           |       |       |\r\n  Deaths from all causes   |       |       |\r\n  annually to 10,000       |       |       |\r\n  persons (5000 males,     |       |       |\r\n  5000 females) living,    |       |       |\r\n  during the 7 years,      |       |       |\r\n  1838-44                  |  252  |  251  |  257\r\n  -------------------------+-------+-------+--------\r\n\r\nHere, it will be seen, that while the houses on the north side of the\r\nriver stand, on an average, 51 feet above the high-water mark of the\r\nThames, those on the south side are only 5 feet above it. The effect\r\nof this is shown most particularly in the deaths from cholera in 1849,\r\nwhich were nearly three times as many on the south as on the north side\r\nof the Thames. It is said, officially, that “of the 15 square miles of\r\nthe Urban district on the south side of the river Thames, _three_ miles\r\nare from six to seven feet below high-water mark, so that the locality\r\nmay be said to be drained only for four hours out of the twelve, and\r\nduring these four hours very imperfectly.... When the tide rises above\r\nthe orifices of the sewers, the whole drainage of the district is\r\nstopped until the tide recedes again, rendering the whole system of\r\nsewers in Kent and Surrey only an _articulation of cesspools_.”\r\n\r\nThat this is but the fact, the following table of the elevation in feet\r\nabove the Trinity high-water mark, as regards the several districts on\r\nthe Surrey side of the Thames, may be cited as evidence.\r\n\r\n                                Elevation.\r\n  Lewisham                         28\r\n  Wandsworth                       22\r\n  Greenwich                         8\r\n  Camberwell                        4\r\n  Lambeth                           3\r\n  St. Saviour (Southwark)           2\r\n  St. Olave                         2\r\n  Bermondsey                        0\r\n  Rotherhithe                       0\r\n  St. George’s (Southwark)          0\r\n  Newington (below high water)      2\r\n\r\nFrom these returns, made by Capt. Dawson, R.E., the difficulty, to use\r\nno stronger word, attending the sewerage of the Surrey district is\r\nshown at once. There is no flow to be had, or--the word more generally\r\nused, no _run_ for the sewage. In parts of the north of England it used\r\nto be a general, and still is a partial, saying among country-people\r\nwho are figuratively describing what they account impossible. “Ay,\r\nwhen? _When_ water runs up bank.” This is a homely expression of the\r\ndifficulties attending the Surrey sewerage.\r\n\r\nThere is, as regards these Surrey, more than the Kent, sewers, another\r\nevil which promotes the “articulation of cesspools.” Some of these\r\nsewers have “dead-ends,” like places which in the streets (a parallel\r\ncase enough) are known as “no thoroughfare,” and in these sewers it is\r\nseldom, in any state of the tide, that flushing can be resorted to;\r\nconsequently these cesspool-like sewers remain uncleansed, or have to\r\nbe cleansed by manual labour, the matter being drawn up into the street\r\nor road.\r\n\r\nThe refuse conduits of the metropolis are of two kinds:--\r\n\r\n  1. Sewers.\r\n  2. Drains.\r\n\r\nThese two classes of refuse-charts are often confounded, even in some\r\nofficial papers, the sewer being there designated the “main drain.” All\r\nsewerage is undoubtedly drainage, but there is a manifest distinction\r\nbetween a sewer and a drain.\r\n\r\nThe First-Class Sewers, which are generally termed “main sewers,” and\r\nrun along the centres of the first-class streets (first-class alike\r\nfrom the extent or populousness of such streets), may be looked upon\r\nas underground rivers of refuse, to which the drains are tributary\r\nrivulets. No sewer exists unconnected with the drains from the streets\r\nand houses; but many house-drains are constructed apart from the\r\nsewers, communicating only with the cesspools. Even where houses are\r\nbuilt in close contiguity to a public sewer, and built after the new\r\nmode without cesspools, there is always a drain to the sewer; no house\r\nso situated can get rid of its refuse except by means of a drain;\r\nunless, indeed, the house be not drained at all, and its filth be flung\r\ndown a gullyhole, or got rid of in some other way.\r\n\r\nThese drains, all with a like determination, differ only in their\r\nforms. They are barrel-shaped, made of rounded bricks, or earthenware\r\npipeage, and of an interior between a round and an oval, with a\r\ndiameter of from 2 to 6 inches, although only a few private houses,\r\ncomparatively, are so drained. The barrel drain of larger dimensions,\r\nis used in the newer public buildings and larger public mansions, when\r\nit represents a sort of house or interior sewer as well as a house\r\nmain drain, for smaller drains find their issue into the barrel-drain.\r\nThere is the barrel-drain in the new Houses of Parliament, and in large\r\nplaces which cover the site of, and are required for the purposes of\r\nseveral houses or offices. The tubular drain is simply piping, of which\r\nI have spoken fully in my account of the present compulsory mode of\r\nhouse drainage. The third drain, one more used to carry refuse to the\r\ncesspool than the sewer, but still carrying such refuse to the sewers,\r\nis the old-fashioned brick drain, generally 9 inches square.\r\n\r\nI shall first deal with the sewerage, and then with the house and\r\nstreet drainage.\r\n\r\nThe sewer is a twofold receptacle of refuse; into it are conveyed the\r\nwet refuse not only of many of the houses, but of all the streets.\r\n\r\nThe slop or surface water of the streets is conveyed to the sewer by\r\nmeans of smaller sewers or street-drains running from the “kennel” or\r\nchannel to the larger sewers.\r\n\r\nIn the streets, at such uncertain distances as the traffic and\r\ncircumstances of the locality may require, are gully-holes. These are\r\nopenings into the sewer, and were formerly called, as they were, simply\r\ngratings, a sort of iron trap-doors of grated bars, clumsily made, and\r\nplaced almost at random. On each side of the street was, even into\r\nthe present century, a very formidable channel, or kennel, as it was\r\nformerly written, into which, in heavy rains, the badly-scavaged street\r\ndirt was swept, often demanding a good leap from one who wished to\r\ncross in a hurry. These “kennels” emptied themselves into the gratings,\r\nwhich were not unfrequently choked up, and the kennel was then an utter\r\nnuisance. At the present time the channel is simply a series of stone\r\nwork at the edge of the footpaths, blocks of granite being sloped to\r\nmeet more or less at right angles, and the flow from the inclination\r\nfrom the centre of the street to the channel is carried along without\r\nimpedimen or nuisance into the gully-hole.\r\n\r\nThe gully-hole opens into a drain, running, with a rapid slope, into\r\nthe sewer, and so the wet refuse of the streets find its vent.\r\n\r\nIn many courts, alleys, lanes, &c., inhabited by the poor, where there\r\nis imperfect or no drainage to the houses, all the slops from the\r\nhouses are thrown down the gully-holes, and frequently enough blood and\r\noffal are poured from butchers’ premises, which might choke the house\r\ndrain. There have, indeed, been instances of worthless street dirt\r\n(slop) collected into a scavager’s vehicle being shot down a gully-hole.\r\n\r\nThe sewers, as distinct from the drains, are to be divided principally\r\ninto three classes, all devoted to the same purpose--the conveyance\r\nof the underground filth of the capital to the Thames--and all\r\nconnected by a series of drains, afterwards to be described, with the\r\ndwelling-houses.\r\n\r\nThe _first-class sewers_ are found in the main streets, and flow at\r\ntheir outlets into the river.\r\n\r\nThe _second-class sewers_ run along the second-class streets,\r\ndischarging their contents into a first-class sewer; and\r\n\r\nThe _third-class sewers_ are for the reception of the sewage from the\r\nsmaller streets, and always communicate, for the voidance of their\r\ncontents, with a sewer of the second or first description.\r\n\r\nAs regards the destination of the sewers, there is no difference\r\nbetween the Middlesex and Surrey portions of the metropolis. The sewage\r\nis _all_ floated into the river.\r\n\r\nThe first-class sewers of the modern build rarely exceed 50 inches\r\nby 30 in internal dimensions; the second class, 40 inches by 24; the\r\nthird, 30 inches by 18.\r\n\r\nSmaller class or branch sewers, from No. 4 to No. 8 inclusive, also\r\nform part of the great subterranean filth-channels of the metropolis.\r\nIt is only, however, the three first-mentioned classes which can be\r\ndescribed as in any way principal _sewers_; the others are in the\r\ncapacity of branch sewers, the ramifications being in many places very\r\nextensive, while pipes are often used. The dimensions of these smaller\r\nsewers, when pipes are not used, are--No. 4, 20 inches by 12; No. 5,\r\n17-1/2 inches by 10-1/2; No. 6, 15 inches by 9; No. 7, 12 inches by\r\n7-1/2; and No. 8, 9 inches by 6.\r\n\r\nThese branch sewers may, from their circumscribed dimensions, be looked\r\nupon as mere channels of connection with the larger descriptions; but\r\nthey present, as I have intimated, an important part of the general\r\nsystem. This may be shown by the fact, that in the estimates for\r\nbuilding sewers for the improvement of the drainage of the city of\r\nWestminster (a plan, however, not carried out), the estimated, or\r\nindeed surveyed, run of the first class was to be 8118 feet; of the\r\nsecond class, 4524 feet; of the third, but 2086 feet; while of the No.\r\n5 and No. 6 description, it was, respectively, 18,709 and 53,284 feet.\r\nThe branch sewers may, perhaps, be represented in many instances as\r\npublic drains connecting the sewer of the street with the issue from\r\nthe houses, but I give the appellation I find in the reports.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions I have cited are not to be taken as an average size of\r\nthe existing sewers of the metropolis on either side of the Thames, for\r\nno average size and no uniformity of shape can be adduced, as there has\r\nbeen no uniformity observed. The sewers are of all sizes and shapes,\r\nand of all depths from the surface of the streets. I was informed by\r\nan engineering authority that he had often seen it asserted that the\r\nnaval authorities of the kingdom could not build a war-steamer, and it\r\nmight very well be said that the sanitary authorities of the metropolis\r\ncould not build a sewer, as none of the present sewers could be cited\r\nas in all respects properly fulfilling all the functions required.\r\nBut it must be remembered that the present engineers have to contend\r\nwith great difficulties, the whole matter being so complicated by the\r\nblunderings and mismanagement of the past.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions I have cited (because they appear officially) exceed the\r\nmedium size of the _newer_ sewerage, the average height of the first\r\nclass being in such sewers about 3 feet 9 inches.\r\n\r\n_Of the width of the sewers_, as of the height, no precise average can\r\nbe drawn. Perhaps that of the New Palace main, or first-class sewer, 3\r\nfeet 6 inches, may be nearest the average, while the smaller classes\r\ndiminish in their width in the proportions I have shown. The sewers of\r\nthe older constructions nearly all widen and deepen as they near the\r\noutlet, and this at no definite distance from the river, but from a\r\nquarter of a mile or somewhat less to a mile and more. Some such sewers\r\nare then 14 feet in width; some 20 feet, and no doubt of proportionate\r\nheight, but I do not find that the height has been ascertained.\r\nFor flushing purposes there are recesses of greater or less width,\r\naccording to the capacity of the sewer, where sluice-gates, &c., can be\r\nfixed, and water accumulated.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of “Subterranean Survey of the Sewers,” will be found\r\nsome account of the different dimensions of the sewers.\r\n\r\n_The form of the interior of the sewers_ (as shown in the illustrations\r\nI have given) is irregularly elliptical. They are arched at the\r\nsummits, and more or less hollowed or curved, internally, at the\r\nbottom. The bottom of the sewer is called the “invert,” from a general\r\nresemblance in the construction to an “inverted” arch. The _best_ form\r\nof invert is a matter which has attracted great engineering attention.\r\nIt is, indeed, the important part of the sewer, as the part along which\r\nthere is the flow of sewage; and the superior or inferior formation of\r\nthe invert, of course, facilitates or retards the transmission of the\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nA few years back, the building of egg-shaped, or “oviform” sewers, was\r\nstrongly advocated. It was urged that the flow of the sewage and the\r\nsewer-water was accelerated by the invert (especially) being oviform,\r\nas the matter was more condensed when such was the shape adopted, while\r\nthe more the matter was diffused, as in some of the inverts of the more\r\nusual form of sewers, the less rapid was its flow, and consequently the\r\ngreater its deposit.\r\n\r\nWhat extent of egg-shaped sewers are now, so to speak, at work, I could\r\nnot ascertain. One informant thought it might be somewhere about 50\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account of the velocities of streams, with\r\na relativeness to sewers, is extracted from the evidence of Mr.\r\nPhillips:--\r\n\r\n“The area of surface that a sewer will drain, and the quantity of water\r\nthat it will discharge in a given time, will be greater or less in\r\nproportion as the channel is inclined from a horizontal to a vertical\r\nposition. The ordinary or common run of water in each sewer, due from\r\nhouse drainage alone, and irrespective of rain, should have sufficient\r\nvelocity to prevent the usual matter discharged into the sewer from\r\ndepositing. For this purpose, it is necessary that there should be\r\nin each sewer a constant velocity of current equal to 2-1/2 feet per\r\nsecond, or 1-3/4 mile per hour.” Mr. Phillips then states that the\r\ninclinations of all rivulets, &c., diminish as they progress to their\r\noutfalls. “If the force of the waters of the river Rhone,” he has said,\r\n“were not absorbed by the operation of some constant retardation in\r\nits course, the stream would have shot into the Bay of Marseilles with\r\nthe tremendous velocity of 164 miles every hour. Even if the Thames\r\nmet with no system of impediments in its course, the stream would have\r\nrushed into the sea with a velocity of 80 feet per second, or 54-1/2\r\nmiles in an hour.... The inclinations of the sewers of a natural\r\ndistrict should be made to diminish from their heads to their outfalls\r\nin a corresponding ratio of progression, so that as the body of water\r\nis increased at each confluence, one and the same velocity and force of\r\ncurrent may be kept up throughout the whole of them.”\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips advocates a tubular system of sewerage and drainage.\r\n\r\nThe main sewer, which has lately called forth the most public\r\nattention and professional controversy, is that connected with the\r\nnew Houses of Parliament, or as they are called in divers reports and\r\ncorrespondence, the “New Palace at Westminster.”\r\n\r\n_The workmanship in the building of the sewers_ is of every quality.\r\nThe material of which some of the older sewers are constructed is a\r\nporous sort of brick, which is often found crumbling and broken, and\r\nsaturated with damp and rottenness, from the exhalations and contact\r\nof their contents. The sewers erected, however, within the last\r\ntwenty, and more especially within the last ten years, are sometimes\r\nof granite, but generally of the best brick, with an interior coating\r\nof enduring cement, and generally with concrete on their exterior,\r\nto protect them from the dampness and decaying qualities of the\r\nsuperincumbent or lateral soil.\r\n\r\n_The depth of the sewers_--I mean from the top of the sewer to the\r\nsurface of the street--seems to vary as everything else varies about\r\nthem. Some are found forty feet below the street, some _two_ feet, some\r\nalmost level! These, however, are exceptions; and the average depth of\r\nthe sewers on the Middlesex side is from twelve to fourteen feet; on\r\nthe Surrey side, from six to eight feet. The reason is that the north\r\nshores of the metropolis are above the tide level, the south shores are\r\nbelow it.\r\n\r\nAn authority on the subject has said, “The Surrey sewers are bad,\r\nowing principally to the land being below tide level. They were the\r\nmost expensively constructed, because, _perhaps_, in that Commission\r\nthe surveyors were paid by percentage on the cost of works. When it\r\nwas proposed, in the Westminster Commission, to effect a reduction\r\nof four-fifths in the cost, it was like a proposition to return the\r\nofficers’ salaries to that extent, if they had been paid in that way.”\r\n\r\nThe reader may have observed that the official intelligence I have\r\ngiven all, or nearly all, refers to the “Westminster and part of\r\nMiddlesex” Commission, and to that of the “Surrey and Kent.” This is\r\neasily accounted for. In the metropolitan districts, up to 1847, the\r\nonly Commission which published its papers was the Westminster, of\r\nwhich Mr. L. C. Hertslet had the charge as clerk; when the Commissions\r\nwere consolidated in 1847, he printed the Westminster and Surrey only,\r\nthe others being of minor importance.\r\n\r\nI may observe that one of the engineers, in showing the difficulty or\r\nimpossibility of giving any description of a _system_ of sewerage, as\r\nto points of agreement or difference, represents the whole mass as but\r\na “detached parcel of sewers.”\r\n\r\n_The course of the sewers_ is in no direct or uniform line, with the\r\nexception of one characteristic--all their bearings are towards the\r\nriver as regards the main sewers (first-class), and all the bearings\r\nof the second-class sewers are towards the main sewers in the main\r\nstreets. The smaller classes of sewers fill up the great area of London\r\nsewerage with a perfect network of intersection and connection, and\r\neven this network is increased manyfold by its connection with the\r\nhouse-drains.\r\n\r\nThere is no map of the general sewerage of the metropolis, merely\r\n“sections” and “plans” of improvements making or suggested, in the\r\nreports of the surveyors, &c., to the Commissioners; but did a map of\r\nsubterranean London exist, with its lines of every class of sewerage\r\nand of the drainage which feeds the sewers; with its course, moreover,\r\nof gas-pipes and water-pipes, with their connection with the houses,\r\nthe streets, the courts, &c., it would be the most curious and\r\nskeleton-like map in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SUBTERRANEAN CHARACTER OF THE SEWERS.\r\n\r\nIn my inquiries among that curious body of men, the “Sewer Hunters,”\r\nI found them make light of any danger, their principal fear being\r\nfrom the attacks of rats in case they became isolated from the gang\r\nwith whom they searched in common, while they represented the odour\r\nas a mere nothing in the way of unpleasantness. But these men pursued\r\nonly known and (by them) beaten tracks at low water, avoiding any\r\ndeviation, and so becoming but partially acquainted with the character\r\nand direction of the sewers. And had it been otherwise, they are not\r\na class competent to describe what they saw, however keen-eyed after\r\nsilver spoons.\r\n\r\nThe following account is derived chiefly from official sources. I\r\nmay premise that where the deposit is found the greatest, the sewer\r\nis in the worst state. This deposit, I find it repeatedly stated,\r\nis of a most miscellaneous character. Some of the sewers, indeed,\r\nare represented as the dust-bins and dung-hills of the immediate\r\nneighbourhood. The deposit has been found to comprise all the\r\ningredients from the breweries, the gas-works, and the several chemical\r\nand mineral manufactories; dead dogs, cats, kittens, and rats; offal\r\nfrom slaughter-houses, sometimes even including the entrails of the\r\nanimals; street-pavement dirt of every variety; vegetable refuse;\r\nstable-dung; the refuse of pig-styes; night-soil; ashes; tin kettles\r\nand pans (pansherds); broken stoneware, as jars, pitchers, flower-pots,\r\n&c.; bricks; pieces of wood; rotten mortar and rubbish of different\r\nkinds; and even rags. Our criminal annals of the previous century show\r\nthat often enough the bodies of murdered men were thrown into the Fleet\r\nand other ditches, then the open sewers of the metropolis, and if found\r\nwashed into the Thames, they were so stained and disfigured by the\r\nfoulness of the contents of these ditches, that recognition was often\r\nimpossible, so that there could be but one verdict returned--“Found\r\ndrowned.” Clothes stripped from a murdered person have been, it was\r\nauthenticated on several occasions in Old Bailey evidence, thrown into\r\nthe open sewer ditches, when torn and defaced, so that they might\r\nnot supply evidence of identity. So close is the connection between\r\nphysical filthiness in public matters and moral wickedness.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars show the characteristics of the underground\r\nLondon of the sewers. The subterranean surveys were made after the\r\ncommissions were consolidated.\r\n\r\n“An old sewer, running between Great Smith-street and St. Ann-street\r\n(Westminster), is a curiosity among sewers, although it is probably\r\nonly one instance out of many similar constructions that will be\r\ndiscovered in the course of the subterranean survey. The bottom is\r\nformed of planks laid upon transverse timbers, 6 inches by 6 inches,\r\nabout 3 feet apart. The size of the sewer varies in width from 2 to 6\r\nfeet, and from 4 to 5 feet in height. The inclination of the bottom\r\nis very irregular: there are jumps up at two or three places, and it\r\ncontains a deposit of filth averaging 9 inches in depth, the sickening\r\nsmell from which escapes into the houses and yards that drain into it.\r\nIn many places the side walls have given way for lengths of 10 and 15\r\nfeet. Across this sewer timbers have been laid, upon which the external\r\nwall of a workshop has been built; the timbers are in a decaying state,\r\nand should they give way, the wall will fall into the sewer.”\r\n\r\nFrom the further accounts of this survey, I find that a sewer from\r\nthe Westminster Workhouse, which was of all shapes and sizes, was in\r\nso wretched a condition that the leveller could scarcely work for\r\nthe thick scum that covered the glasses of the spirit-level in a few\r\nminutes after being wiped. “At the outfall into the Dean-street sewer,\r\nit is 3 feet 6 inches by 2 feet 8 inches for a short length. From the\r\nend of this, a wide sewer branches in each direction at right angles,\r\n5 feet 8 inches by 5 feet 5 inches. Proceeding to the eastward about\r\n30 feet, a chamber is reached about 30 feet in length, from the roof\r\nof which hangings of putrid matter _like stalactites_ descend _three\r\nfeet in length_. At the end of this chamber, the sewer passes under the\r\npublic privies, the ceilings of which can be seen from it. Beyond this\r\nit is not possible to go.”\r\n\r\n“In the Lucas-street sewer, where a portion of new work begins and the\r\nold terminates, a space of about 10 feet has been covered with boards,\r\nwhich, having broken, a dangerous chasm has been caused immediately\r\nunder the road.”\r\n\r\n“The West-street sewer had one foot of deposit. It was flushed while\r\nthe levelling party was at work there, and the stream was so rapid that\r\nit nearly washed them away, instrument and all.”\r\n\r\nThere are further accounts of “deposit,” or of “stagnant filth,” in\r\nother sewers, varying from 6 to 14 inches, but that is insignificant\r\ncompared to what follows.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing, then, is the pith of the first authentic account which\r\nhas appeared in print of the actually surveyed condition of the\r\nsubterranean ways, over which the super-terranean tides of traffic are\r\ndaily flowing.\r\n\r\nThe account I have just given relates to the (former) Westminster\r\nand part of Middlesex district on the north bank of the Thames, as\r\nascertained under the Metropolitan Commission. I now give some extracts\r\nconcerning a similar survey on the south bank, in different and\r\ndistant directions in the district, once the “Surrey and Kent.” The\r\nWestminster, &c., survey took place in 1848; the Kent and Surrey in\r\n1849. In the one case, 72 miles of sewers were surveyed; in the other,\r\n69-1/8 miles.\r\n\r\n“The surveyors (in the Surrey and Kent sewers) find great difficulty\r\nin levelling the sewers of this district (I give the words of the\r\nReport); for, in the first place, the deposit is _usually_ about two\r\nfeet in depth, and in some cases it amounts to nearly _five feet_ of\r\nputrid matter. The smell is usually of the most horrible description,\r\nthe air being so foul that explosion and choke damp are very frequent.\r\nOn the 12th January we were very nearly losing a whole party by choke\r\ndamp, the last man being dragged out on his back (through two feet of\r\nblack fœtid deposits) in a state of insensibility.... Two men of one\r\nparty had also a narrow escape from drowning in the Alscot-road sewer,\r\nRotherhithe.\r\n\r\n“The sewers on the Surrey side are very irregular; even where they are\r\ninverted they frequently have a number of steps and inclinations the\r\nreverse way, causing the deposit to accumulate in _elongated cesspools_.\r\n\r\n“It must be considered very fortunate that the subterranean parties\r\ndid not first commence on the Surrey side, for if such had been the\r\ncase, we should most undoubtedly have broken down. When compared with\r\nWestminster, the sewers are smaller and more full of deposit; and, bad\r\nas the smell is in the sewers in Westminster, it is infinitely worse on\r\nthe Surrey side.”\r\n\r\nSeveral details are then given, but they are only particulars of the\r\ngeneral facts I have stated.\r\n\r\nThe following, however, are distinct facts concerning this branch of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nIn my inquiries among the working scavagers I often heard of their\r\nemptying street slop into sewers, and the following extract shows that\r\nI was not misinformed:--\r\n\r\n“The detritus from the macadamized roads frequently forms a kind of\r\ngrouting in the sewers so hard that it cannot be removed without hand\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n“One of the sewers in Whitehall and another in Spring-gardens have from\r\nthree to four feet of this sort of deposit; and another in Eaton-square\r\nwas found filled up within a few inches of the ‘soffit,’ but it is\r\nsupposed that the scavengers (scavagers) emptied the road-sweepings\r\ndown the gully-grate in this instance;” and in other instances, too,\r\nthere is no doubt--especially at Charing Cross, and the Regent Circus,\r\nPiccadilly.\r\n\r\nConcerning the sewerage of the most aristocratic parts of the city\r\nof Westminster, and of the fashionable squares, &c., to the north of\r\nOxford-street, I glean the following particulars (reported in 1849).\r\nThey show, at any rate, that the patrician quarters have not been\r\nunduly favoured; that there has been no partiality in the construction\r\nof the sewerage. In the Belgrave and Eaton-square districts there are\r\nmany faulty places in the sewers which abound with noxious matter, in\r\nmany instances stopping up the house drains and “smelling horribly.”\r\nIt is much the same in the Grosvenor, Hanover, and Berkeley-square\r\nlocalities (the houses in the squares themselves included). Also in the\r\nneighbourhood of Covent-garden, Clare-market, Soho and Fitzroy-squares;\r\nwhile north of Oxford-street, in and about Cavendish, Bryanstone,\r\nManchester, and Portman-squares, there is so much rottenness and decay\r\nthat there is no security for the sewers standing from day to day, and\r\nto flush them for the removal of their “most loathsome deposit” might\r\nbe “to bring some of them down altogether.”\r\n\r\nOne of the accounts of a subterranean survey concludes with the\r\nfollowing rather curious statement:--“Throughout the new Paddington\r\ndistrict the neighbourhood of Hyde Park Gardens, and the costly squares\r\nand streets adjacent, the sewers abound with the foulest deposit, from\r\nwhich the most disgusting effluvium arises; indeed, amidst the whole of\r\nthe Westminster District of Sewers the _only_ little spot which can be\r\nmentioned as being in at all a satisfactory state is the Seven Dials.”\r\n\r\nI may point out also that these very curious and authenticated accounts\r\nby no means bear out the zymotic doctrine of the Board of Health as\r\nto the cause of cholera; for where the zymotic influences from the\r\nsewers were the worst, in the patrician squares of what has been called\r\nBelgravia and Tyburnia, the cholera was the least destructive. This,\r\nhowever, is no reason whatever why the stench should not be stifled.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HOUSE-DRAINAGE OF THE METROPOLIS AS CONNECTED WITH THE SEWERS.\r\n\r\nEvery house built or rebuilt since the passing of the Metropolitan\r\nSewers Act in 1848, must be drained, with an exception, which I shall\r\nspecify, into a sewer. The law, indeed, divested of its technicalities\r\nis this: the owner of a newly-erected house must drain it to a sewer,\r\nwithout the intervention of a cesspool, if there be a sewer within\r\n100 feet of the site of the house; and, if necessary, in places but\r\npartially built over, such owner must continue the sewer along the\r\npremises, and make the necessary drain into it; all being done under\r\nthe approval of the proper officer under the Commissioners. If there\r\nbe, however, an established sewer, along the side, front, or back of\r\nany house, a covered drain must be made into that at the cost of the\r\nowner of the premises to be drained. “Where a sewer,” says the 46th\r\nsection of the Act, “shall already be made, and a drain only shall\r\nbe required, the party is to pay a contribution towards the original\r\nexpense of the sewer, if it shall have been made within thirty-five\r\nyears before the 4th of September, 1848, the contribution to be paid\r\nto the builder of the sewer.”... “In cases where there shall be no\r\nsewer into which a drain could be made, the party must make a covered\r\ndrain to lead into a cesspool or other place (not under a house) as\r\nthe Commissioners may direct. If the parties infringe this rule, the\r\nCommissioners may do the work and throw the cost on them in the nature\r\nof an improvement rate, or as charges for default, and levy the amount\r\nby distress.”\r\n\r\nI mention these circumstances more particularly to show the extent, and\r\nthe far-continued ramification, of the subterranean metropolis. I am\r\nassured by one of the largest builders in the western district of the\r\ncapital that the new regulations (as to the dispensing with cesspools)\r\nare readily complied with, as it is a recommendation which a house\r\nagent, or any one letting new premises, is never slow to advance (“and\r\nwhen it’s the truth,” he said, “they do it with a better grace”), that\r\nthere will be in the course of occupancy no annoyance and no expense\r\nincurred in the clearing away of cesspoolage.\r\n\r\nI shall at present describe only the house-drainage, which is connected\r\nwith the public sewerage. The old mode of draining a house separately\r\ninto the cesspool of the premises will, of course, be described under\r\nthe head of cesspoolage, and that old system is still very prevalent.\r\n\r\nAt the times of passing both general and local Acts concerning\r\nbuildings, town improvements and extensions, the erection of new\r\nstreets and the removal of old, much has been said and written\r\nconcerning better systems of ventilating, warming, and draining\r\ndwelling-houses; but until after the first outbreak of cholera in\r\nEngland, in 1832, little public attention was given to the great\r\ndrainage of all the sewers. However, on the passing of the Building and\r\nSanitary Acts generally, the authorities made many experiments, not so\r\nmuch to improve the system of sewerage as of house-drainage, so as to\r\nmake the dwelling-houses more wholesome and sweet.\r\n\r\nTo effect this, the great object was the abolition of the cesspool\r\nsystem, under which filth must accumulate, and where, from scamped\r\nbuildings or other causes, evaporation took place, the effects of the\r\nsystem were found to be vile and offensive, and have been pronounced\r\nmiasmatic. Having just alluded to these matters, I proceed to describe\r\nthe modernly-adopted connection of house-drainage and street-sewerage.\r\n\r\nExperiments, as I have said, were set on foot under the auspices of\r\npublic bodies, and the opinions of eminent engineers, architects,\r\nand surveyors were also taken. Their opinions seem really to be\r\nconcentrated in the advocacy of _one_ remedy--improved house-drainage;\r\nand they appear to have agreed that the system which is at present\r\nadopted is, under the circumstances, the best that can be adopted.\r\n\r\nI was told also by an eminent practical builder, perfectly unconnected\r\nwith any official or public body, and, indeed, often at issue with\r\nsurveyors, &c., that the new system was unquestionably a great\r\nimprovement in every respect, and that some years before its adoption\r\nas at present he had abetted such a system, and had carried it into\r\neffect when he could properly do so.\r\n\r\nI will first show the mode and then the cost of the new system.\r\n\r\nI find it designated “back,” “front,” “tubular,” and “pipe”\r\nhouse-drainage, and all with the object of carrying off all fæces, soil\r\nwater, cesspool matter, &c., before it has had time to accumulate.\r\nIt is not by brick or other drains of masonry that the system is\r\ncarried out or is recommended to be carried out, but by means of\r\ntubular earthenware pipes; and for any efficient carrying out of the\r\nprojected improvement a system of _constant_, and not as at present\r\n_intermittent_, supply of water from the several companies would be\r\nbest. These pipes communicate with the nearest sewer. The pipes in the\r\ntubular drainage are of red earthenware or stoneware (pot).\r\n\r\nThe use of earthenware, clay, or pot pipes for the conveyance of\r\nliquids is very ancient. Mr. Stirrat, a bleacher in Paisley, in a\r\nstatement to the Board of Health, mentioned that clay pipes were used\r\nin ancient times. King Hezekiah (2nd Book of Kings, chap. 20, and 2nd\r\nBook of Chronicles, chap. 32) brought in water from Jerusalem. “His\r\npool and conduit,” said Mr. Stirrat, “are still to be seen. The conduit\r\nis three feet square inside, built of freestone, strongly cemented;\r\nthe stone, fifteen inches thick, evidently intended to sustain a\r\nconsiderable pressure; and I have seen pipes of clay, taken by a friend\r\nfrom a house in the ruins of the ancient city, of one inch bore,\r\nand about seven inches in diameter, proving evidently, to my mind,\r\nthat ancient Jerusalem was supplied with water on the principle of\r\ngravitation. The pools or reservoirs are also at this day in tolerably\r\ngood order, one of them still filled with water; the other broken down\r\nin the centre, no doubt by some besieging enemy, to cut off the supply\r\nto the city.”\r\n\r\nThe new system to supply the place of the cesspools is a _combined_,\r\nwhile the old is principally a _separate_, system of house-drainage;\r\nbut the new system is equally available for such separate drainage.\r\n\r\nAs regards the success of this system the reports say experiments have\r\nbeen tried in so large a number of houses, under such varied and, in\r\nmany cases, disadvantageous circumstances, that no doubts whatsoever\r\ncan remain in the minds of competent and disinterested persons as to\r\nthe efficient self-cleansing action of well-adjusted tubular drains and\r\nsewers, even without any additional supplies of water.\r\n\r\nMr. Lovick said:--\r\n\r\n“A great number of small 4-inch tubular drains have been laid down\r\nin the several districts, some for considerable periods. They have\r\nbeen found to keep themselves clear by the ordinary soil and drainage\r\nwaters of the houses. I have no doubt that pipes of this kind will keep\r\nthemselves clear by the ordinary discharge of house-drainage; assuming,\r\nof course, a supply of water, pipes of good form, and materials\r\nproperly laid, and with fair usage.”\r\n\r\n“One of the earliest illustrations of the tubular system,” it is stated\r\nin a Report of the Board of Health, “was given in the improved drainage\r\nof a block of houses in the cloisters of Westminster, which had been\r\nthe seat of a severe epidemic fever. The cesspools and the old drains\r\nwere filled up, and an entire system of tubular drainage and sewerage\r\nsubstituted for the service of that block of houses.\r\n\r\n“The Dean of Westminster, in a letter on the state of this drainage,\r\nsays, ‘I beg to report to the Commissioners that the success of the\r\nentire new pipe-drainage laid down in St. Peter’s College during the\r\nlast twelve months has been complete. I consider this experiment on\r\ndrainage and sewage of about fifteen houses to afford a triumphant\r\nproof of the efficacy of draining by pipes, and of the facility of\r\n_dispensing entirely with cesspools and brick sewers_.’ Up to this time\r\nthey have acted, and continue to act, perfectly.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Morris, a surveyor attached to the Metropolitan Sewers Commission,\r\ngives the following account of the action of trial works of improved\r\nhouse-drainage:--\r\n\r\n“‘I have introduced the new 4-inch tubular house-drains into some\r\nhouses for the trustees of the parish of Poplar, with water-closets,\r\nand have received no just cause of complaint. In every instance where\r\nI have applied it, I found the system answer extremely well, if a\r\nsufficient quantity of water has been used.\r\n\r\n“‘The answer of the householders as to the effect of the new drainage\r\nhas invariably been that they and their families have been better in\r\nhealth; that they were formerly annoyed with smells and effluvia, from\r\nwhich they are now quite free.\r\n\r\n“‘Since the new drainage has been laid down there has been only\r\noccasion to go on the ground to examine it once for the whole year, and\r\nthat was from the inefficiency of the water service. It was found that\r\nrags had been thrown down and had got into the pipe; and further, that\r\nvery little water had been used, so that the stoppage was the fault of\r\nthe tenant, not of the system.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Gotto, the engineer, having stated that in a plan for the\r\nimprovement of Goulston-street, Whitechapel, not only was the\r\nremoval of all cesspools contemplated, but also the substitution of\r\nwater-closet apparatus, gave the following estimate of _the cost_,\r\nprovided the pipes were made and the work done by contract under the\r\nCommissioners of Sewers:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Water-closet Apparatus, &c._\r\n\r\n                                            £  _s._  _d._\r\n    Emptying, &c., cesspool                 0   12    0\r\n  Digging, &c., for 8-feet pipe drain,\r\n    at 4_d._                                0    2    8\r\n  Making good to walls and floor of\r\n    water-closet over drain, at 3_d._       0    2    0\r\n    8 feet run of 4-inch pipe, at 3_d._     0    2    0\r\n    Laying ditto, at 2_d._                  0    1    4\r\n    Extra for junction                      0    0    4\r\n    Fixing ditto                            0    0    2\r\n    Water-closet apparatus, with stool\r\n  cock                                      0   10    0\r\n    Fixing ditto                            0    2    0\r\n    Contingencies (10 per cent.)            0    3    6\r\n  The yard sink and drain would\r\n  cost                                      0   11    2\r\n    Kitchen sink and drain                  0   15    7-1/2\r\n                                            ---------------\r\n\r\n    So that the cost of _back_ draining\r\n  one house, including water-closet,\r\n  would be                                  3    2    9-1/2\r\n\r\nThe _front_ tubular drainage of a similar house (with fifteen yards\r\nof carriage-way to be paved) would cost 6_l._ 2_s._ 7-1/2_d._; or the\r\ndrainage would cost, according to the old system, 11_l._ 13_s._ 11_d._\r\n\r\n“The engineering witnesses who have given their special attention\r\nto the subject,” state the Board of Health, in commenting on the\r\ninformation I have just cited, “affirm that upon the improved system\r\nof combined works the expense of the apparatus in substitution of\r\ncesspools would _not greatly exceed one-half the expense_ of cleaning\r\nthe cesspools.”\r\n\r\nThe engineers have calculated--stating the difficulty of coming to a\r\nnice calculation--that the present system of cesspools entailed an\r\naverage expenditure, for cleansing and repairs, of 4_d._ a week on each\r\nhouseholder; and that by the new system it would be but 1-3/4_d._ The\r\nBoard of Health’s calculations, however, are, I regret to say, always\r\ndubious.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined scale of the difference in cost was prepared at the\r\ninstance of the Board.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant took four blocks of houses for examination, and the results\r\nare given as a guide to what would be the general expenditure if the\r\nchange took place:--\r\n\r\n “In one block of 44 houses--\r\n\r\n The length of drains by back drainage was 1544 feet.\r\n\r\n Cost (exclusive of pans, traps, and water in both cases) of back\r\n drainage, 83_l._ 12_s._, or 1_l._ 18_s._ per house.\r\n\r\n Cost of separate tubular drainage, 467_l._ 9_s._ 6_d._, or 10_l._\r\n 12_s._ 6_d._ per house.\r\n\r\n Cost of separate brick drains, 910_l._ 19_s._, or 20_l._ 14_s._ 1_d._\r\n per house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n “In another block of 23 houses--\r\n\r\n The length of back drains was 783 feet.\r\n\r\n Of separate drains, 1437 feet.\r\n\r\n The cost of back tubular drains, 45_l._ 12_s._ 6_d._, or 1_l._ 19_s._\r\n 8_d._ per house.\r\n\r\n Of separate tubular drains, 131_l._ 13_s._ 6_d._, or 5_l._ 14_s._\r\n 6_d._ per house.\r\n\r\n Of separate brick drains, 305_l._ 7_s._, or 13_l._ 5_s._ 6_d._ per\r\n house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n “In another block of 46 houses--\r\n\r\n The length of back drainage, 1143 feet.\r\n\r\n Ditto by separate ditto, 1892 feet.\r\n\r\n The cost of back tubular drainage, 66_l._ 5_s._ 2_d._, or 1_l._ 8_s._\r\n 9-3/4_d._ per house.\r\n\r\n Ditto of separate ditto ditto, 178_l._ 19_s._ 8_d._, or 3_l._ 17_s._\r\n 10_d._ per house.\r\n\r\n Ditto of separate brick ditto, 390_l._ 4_s._, or 8_l._ 9_s._ 8_d._ per\r\n house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n “In a fourth block of 46 houses--\r\n\r\n The length of back drains, 985 feet.\r\n\r\n Ditto of separate ditto, 2913 feet.\r\n\r\n Cost of back tubular drainage, 66_l._ 8_s._ 2_d._, or 1_l._ 8_s._\r\n 10-1/2_d._ per house.\r\n\r\n Ditto of separate ditto ditto, 262_l._ 11_s._ 7_d._, or 5_l._ 14_s._\r\n 2_d._ per house.\r\n\r\n Ditto of separate brick ditto, 614_l._ 16_s._ 3_d._, or 13_l._ 7_s._\r\n 3-3/4_d._ per house.”\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the diversity of opinion as to the best form, and\r\neven material, for a sewer; and there is the same diversity as to\r\nthe material, &c., for house and gully or street-drainage, more\r\nespecially in the _pipes_ of the larger volume. The pipe-drainage of\r\nany description is far less in favour than it was. One reason is that\r\nit does not promote _subsoil drainage_; another is the difficulty\r\nof repairs if the joints or fittings of pipes require mending; and\r\nthen the combination of the noxious gases is most offensive in its\r\nexhalations, and difficult to overcome.\r\n\r\nI was informed by a nightman, used to the cleansing of drains and to\r\nnight-work generally, that when there was any escape from one of the\r\ntubular pipes the stench was more intense than any he had ever before\r\nexperienced from any drains on the old system.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LONDON STREET-DRAINS.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet dealt only with the means of removing the liquid\r\nrefuse from the houses of the metropolis. This, as was pointed out\r\nat the commencement of the present subject, consists principally of\r\nthe 19,000,000,000 gallons of water that are annually supplied to the\r\nLondon residences by mechanical means. But there still remain the\r\n5,000,000,000 gallons of surface or rain-water to be carried off from\r\nthe 1760 miles of streets, and the roofs and yards of the 300,000\r\nhouses which now form the British metropolis. If this immense volume of\r\nliquid were not immediately removed from our thoroughfares as fast as\r\nit fell, many of our streets would not only be transformed into canals\r\nat certain periods of the year, but perhaps at all times (except during\r\ndrought) they would be, if not impassable, at least unpleasant and\r\nunhealthy, from the puddles or small pools of stagnant water that would\r\nbe continually rotting them. Were such the case, the roads and streets\r\nthat we now pride ourselves so highly upon would have their foundations\r\nsoddened. “If the surface of a road be not kept clean so as to admit\r\nof its becoming dry between showers of rain,” said Lord Congleton,\r\nthe great road authority, “it will be rapidly worn away.” Indeed the\r\nimmediate removal of rain-water, so as to prevent its percolating\r\nthrough the surface of the road, and thereby impairing the foundation,\r\nappears to be one of the main essentials of road-making.\r\n\r\nThe means of removing this surface water, especially from the streets\r\nof a city where the rain falls at least every other day throughout the\r\nyear, and reaches an aggregate depth of 24 feet in the course of the\r\ntwelvemonth, is a matter of considerable moment. In Paris, and indeed\r\nalmost all of the French towns, a channel is formed in the middle of\r\neach thoroughfare, and down this the water from the streets and houses\r\nis continually coursing, to the imminent peril of all pedestrians, for\r\nthe wheels of every vehicle distribute, as it goes, a muddy shower on\r\neither side of the way.\r\n\r\n_We_, however, have not only removed the channels from the middle to\r\nthe sides of our streets, but instituted a distinct system of drainage\r\nfor the conveyance of the wet refuse of our houses to the sewers--so\r\nthat there are no longer (excepting in a very small portion of the\r\nsuburbs) open sewers, meandering through our highways; the consequence\r\nis, the surface-water being carried off from our thoroughfares almost\r\nas fast as it falls, our streets are generally dry and clean. That\r\nthere are exceptions to this rule, which are a glaring disgrace to us,\r\nit must be candidly admitted; but we must at the same time allow, when\r\nwe think of the vast extent of the roadways of the metropolis (1760\r\nmiles!--nearly one-half the radius of the earth itself), the deluge\r\nof water that annually descends upon every inch of the ground which\r\nwe call London (38,000,000,000 gallons!--a quantity which is almost\r\nsufficient for the formation of an American lake), and the vast amount\r\nof traffic, over the greater part of the capital--the 13,000 vehicles\r\nthat daily cross London Bridge, the 11,000 conveyances that traverse\r\nCheapside in the course of twelve hours, the 7700 that go through\r\nTemple Bar, and the 6900 that ascend and descend Holborn Hill between\r\nnine in the morning and nine at night, the 1500 omnibuses and the 3000\r\ncabriolets that are continually hurrying from one part of the town to\r\nanother, and the 10,000 private carriage, job, and cart horses that\r\nincessantly _perviate_ the metropolis--when we reflect, I say, on this\r\nvast amount of traffic--this deluge of rain--and the wilderness of\r\nstreets, it cannot but be allowed that the cleansing and draining of\r\nthe London thoroughfares is most admirably conducted.\r\n\r\nThe mode of street drainage is by means of what is called a gully-hole\r\nand a gully-drain.\r\n\r\n_The Gully-hole_[63] is the opening from the surface of the street (and\r\nis seen generally on each side of the way), into which all the fluid\r\nrefuse of the public thoroughfares runs on its course to the sewer.\r\n\r\n_The Gully-drain_ is a drain generally of earthenware piping, curving\r\nfrom the side of the street to an opening in the top or side of the\r\nsewer, and is the means of communication between the sewer and the\r\ngully-hole.\r\n\r\nThe gully-hole is indicated by an iron grate being fitted into the\r\nsurface of the side of a footpath, where the road slopes gradually\r\nfrom its centre to the edge of the footpath, and down this grate the\r\nwater runs into the channel contrived for it in the construction of\r\nthe streets. These gully-grates, the observant pedestrian--if there\r\nbe a man in this hive of London who, without professional attraction\r\nto the matter, regards for a few minutes the peculiarities of the\r\nstreet (apart from the houses) which he is traversing--an observant\r\npedestrian, I say, would be struck at the constantly-recurring grates\r\nin a given space in some streets, and their paucity in others. In\r\nDrury-lane there is no gully-grate, as you walk down from Holborn to\r\nwhere Drury-lane becomes Wych-street; whilst in some streets, not a\r\ntenth of the length of Drury-lane, there may be three, four, five,\r\nor six grates. The reason is this:--There is no sewer running down\r\nDrury-lane; a contiguous sewer, however, runs down Great Wyld-street,\r\ndraining, where there are drains, the hundred courts and nooks of the\r\npoor, between Drury-lane and Lincoln’s-inn-fields, as well as the more\r\nopen places leading down towards the proximity of Temple Bar. This\r\nGreat Wyld-street sewer, moreover, in its course to Fleet Bridge, is\r\nmade available for the drainage (very grievously deficient, according\r\nto some of the reports of the Board of Health) of Clare-market. Grates\r\nwould of course be required in such a place as Drury-lane, only the\r\nstreet is thought to be sufficiently on the descent to convey the\r\nsurface-water to the grate in Wych-street.\r\n\r\nThe parts in which the gully-grates will be found the most numerous are\r\nwhere the main streets are most intersected by other main streets, or\r\nby smaller off-streets, and indeed wherever the streets, of whatever\r\nsize, continually intersect each other, as they do off nearly all\r\nthe great street-thoroughfares in the City. Although the sewers may\r\nnot be according to the plan of the streets, the gully-grates must\r\nnevertheless be found at the street intersections, whether the nearest\r\npoint to the sewer or not, or else the water would not be quickly\r\ncarried off, and would form a nuisance.\r\n\r\nI am informed, on good authority, both as regards the City and\r\nMetropolitan Commissions, that the average distance of the gully-grates\r\nis thirty yards one from another, including both sides of the way.\r\nTheir number does not depend upon population, but simply on the local\r\ncharacteristics of the highways; for of course the rain falls into all\r\nthe streets in proportion to their size, whether populous or half-empty\r\nlocalities. As, however, the more distant roads have not such an\r\napproximation of grates, and the law which requires their formation\r\nis by no means--and perhaps, without unnecessary interference, cannot\r\nbe--very definite, I am informed that it may fairly be represented,\r\nthat, of the 1760 miles of London public ways, more than two-thirds,\r\n“or” remarked one informant, “say 1200 miles, are grated on _each_ side\r\nof the street or road, at distances of sixty yards.” This would give\r\n59 gully-holes in every one of the 1200 miles of street said to be so\r\nsupplied. Hence the total number throughout the metropolis will be\r\n70,800.\r\n\r\n_The gully-drain_, which is the street-drain, always presents now\r\na sloping curve, describing, more or less, part of a circle. This\r\ndrain starts, so to speak, from the side of the street, while its\r\ncourse to the sewer, in order to economize space, is made by any most\r\nappropriate curve, to include the reception of as great a quantity of\r\nwet street-refuse as possible; for if the gully-drains were formed in\r\na direct, or even a not-very-indirect line, from the street sides to\r\nthe sewers, they would not only be more costly, more numerous, but\r\nwould, in fact, as I was told, “choke the under-ground” of London,\r\nfor now the subterranean capital is so complicated with gas, water,\r\nand drain-pipes, that such a system as will allow room for each is\r\nindispensable. The new system is, moreover, more economical. In the\r\nCity the gully-drains are nearly all of nine-inch diameter in tubular\r\npipeage. In the metropolitan jurisdiction they are the same, but not to\r\nthe same extent, some being only six inches.\r\n\r\nFifty, or even thirty years ago, the old street channels for gully\r\ndrainage were costly constructions, for they were made so as to suit\r\nsewers which were cleansed by the street being taken “up,” and the\r\noffensive deposit, thick and even indurated as it often was in those\r\ndays, drawn to the surface. Some few were three and even four feet\r\nsquare; some two feet six inches wide, and three or four feet high;\r\nall of brick. I am assured that of the extent or cost of these old\r\ncontrivances no accounts have been preserved, but that they were more\r\nthan twice as costly as the present method.\r\n\r\nIn all the reports I have seen, metropolitan or city--the statements\r\nof the flushermen being to the same purport--there are complaints as\r\nto the uses to which the gully-holes are put in many parts, every kind\r\nof refuse admissible through the bars of the grate being stealthily\r\nemptied down them. The paviours, if they have an opportunity, sweep\r\ntheir surplus grout into the gullies, and so do the scavagers with\r\ntheir refuse occasionally, though this is generally done in the\r\nless-frequented parts, to get rid of the “slop,” which is valueless.\r\n\r\nIn a report, published in 1851, Mr. Haywood points out the prevalence\r\nof the practice of using the gully-gratings as dustbins! A sewer under\r\nBillingsgate accumulated in a few months many cart-loads, composed\r\nalmost wholly of fish-shells; and 114 cart-loads of fish-shells,\r\ncinders, and rubbish were removed from the sewers in the vicinity\r\nof Middlesex-street (Petticoat-lane); these had accumulated in\r\nabout twelve months. “Reconstructing the gullies,” he says, “so as\r\nto intercept improper substances (which has been recently done at\r\nBillingsgate), might prevent this material reaching the sewers, but\r\nit would still have to be removed from the gullies, and would thus\r\nstill cause perpetual expense. Indeed, I feel convinced that nothing\r\nbut making public example by convicting and punishing some offenders,\r\nunder clause 69 of ‘The City of London Sewers’ Act,’ will stop the\r\npractice, so universal in the poorer localities, of using the gullies\r\nas dustbins.”\r\n\r\n_The Gully-holes are now trapped_--with very few exceptions, one report\r\nstates, while another report intimates that gully-trapping has no\r\nexception at all. The trap is resorted to so that the effluvium from\r\na gully-drain may not infect the air of the public ways; but among\r\nengineers and medical sanitary inquirers, there is much difference\r\nof opinion as to whether the system of trapping is desirable or not.\r\nThe general opinion seems to be, however, that all gullies should be\r\ntrapped.\r\n\r\nOf the City gully-traps, Mr. Haywood, in a report for the year 1851,\r\nsays, as regards the period of their introduction:--\r\n\r\n“About seventeen years ago your then surveyor (Mr. Kelsey) applied the\r\nfirst traps to sewer gullies, and from that date to the present the\r\ntrapping of gullies has been adopted as a principle, and the city of\r\nLondon is still, I believe, the only metropolitan area in which the\r\ngullies are all trapped. The traps first constructed have since been\r\n(as all first inventions or adaptations ever have or will be) improved\r\nupon, and are rapidly being displaced by those of more improved\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n“Now, of the incompatible conditions required of gully-traps, of the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining such mechanical appliances so effective and\r\nperfect as can _theoretically_ be devised, but yet of the extreme\r\ndesirability of obtaining them as perfect as modern science could\r\nproduce, your honourable court has, at least, for as long as I have\r\nhad the honour of holding office under you, been fully alive to; no\r\nprejudice has opposed impediment to the introduction of novelties; your\r\ncourt has been always open to inventors, and, at the present time,\r\nthere are sixteen different traps or modes of trapping gullies under\r\ntrial within your jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n“Nor has the provision of the means of excluding effluvium from the\r\natmosphere been your only care; but the cleanliness of the sewers, and\r\nthe prevention of accumulation of decomposing refuse, both by regulated\r\ncleansings, and by constructing the sewage upon the most improved\r\nprinciples, have also been your aim and that of your officers; and I\r\ndo not hesitate to assert, that the offensiveness of the escape from\r\nthe gullies has been of late years much diminished by the care bestowed\r\nupon the condition of the sewers.\r\n\r\n“374 gullies have been retrapped in the City upon improved principles\r\nduring the last year.”\r\n\r\nThe gully-traps are on the principle of self-acting valves, but it is\r\nstated in several reports, that these valves often remain permanently\r\nopen, partly from the street refuse (especially if mixed with the\r\ndébris from new or removed buildings) not being sufficiently liquified\r\nto pass through them, and partly from the hinges getting rusted, and so\r\nbecoming fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE LENGTH OF THE LONDON SEWERS AND DRAINS.\r\n\r\nThere is no official account precisely defining the length of the\r\nLondon sewerage; but the information acquired on the subject leaves no\r\ndoubt as to the accuracy of the following facts.\r\n\r\nAbout 900 miles of sewers of the metropolis may be said to have been\r\nsurveyed; and it is known that from 100 to 150 miles more constitute a\r\nportion of the metropolitan sewerage; this, too, independently of that\r\nof the City, which is 50 miles. Altogether I am assured that the sewers\r\nof the urban part of London, included within the 58 square miles before\r\nmentioned, measure 1100 miles.\r\n\r\nThe classes of sewers comprised in this long extent are pretty equally\r\napportioned, each a third, or 366 miles, of the first, second, and\r\nthird classes respectively. Of this extent about 200 miles are\r\nstill, in the year 1852, _open_ sewers!--to say nothing of the great\r\nopen sewer, the Thames. The open sewers are found principally in\r\nthe Surrey districts, in Brixton, Lewisham, Tooting, and places at\r\nthe like distance from the more central parts of the Commissioners’\r\njurisdiction. These open sewers, however, are disappearing, and it is\r\nintended that in time no such places shall exist; as it is, some miles\r\nof them are inclosed yearly. The open sewers in what may be considered\r\nmore of the heart of the metropolis are a portion of the Fleet-ditch in\r\nClerkenwell, and places in Lambeth and Bermondsey, or about 20 miles in\r\nthe interior to 180 miles in the exterior portion of the capital. These\r\nare national disgraces.\r\n\r\nThe 1100 miles above-mentioned, however, include only the sewers,\r\ncomprising neither the house nor gully-drains. According to the present\r\nlaws, all newly-built houses must be drained into the sewers; and in\r\n1850 there were 5000 applications from the western districts alone to\r\nthe Commissioners, for the promotion of the drainage of that number\r\nof old and new houses into the sewers, the old houses having been\r\npreviously drained into cesspools.\r\n\r\nI am assured, on good authority, that fully one-half of the houses in\r\nthe metropolis are at the present time drained into the sewers. In\r\none street, about a century old, containing in the portion surveyed\r\nfor an official purpose, on the two sides of the way, 76 houses, the\r\nnumber was found to be equally divided--half the drainage being into\r\nsewers and half into cesspools. The number of houses in the metropolis\r\nproper, of 115 square miles area, is 307,722. The majority, as far\r\nas is officially known, are now drained into the public sewers, or\r\ninto private or branch sewers communicating with the larger public\r\nreceptacles, so that--allowing 200,000 houses to be included in the 58\r\nsquare miles of the urban sewerage, and admitting that some wretched\r\ndwelling-places are not drained at all--it is reasonable to assume that\r\nat least 100,000 houses within this area are drained into the sewers.\r\n\r\nThe average length of the house-drains is, I learn from the best\r\nsources, 50 feet per house. The builder of a new house is now required\r\nby law to drain it, at the proprietor’s cost, 100 feet, if necessary,\r\nto a sewer. In some instances, in detached houses, where the owners\r\nobject to the cesspool system, a house drain has been carried 230 feet\r\nto a sewer, and sometimes even farther; but in narrow or moderately\r\nwide streets, from 18 to 26 feet across, and in alleys and narrow\r\nplaces (in case there is sewerage) the house drains may be but from 12\r\nto 20 feet. Both these lengths of drainage are exceptions, and there\r\nis no question that the average length may be put at 50 feet. In some\r\nsquares, for example, the sewer runs along the centre, so that the\r\nhouse-drains here are in excess of the 50 feet average.\r\n\r\nThe length of the house-drainage of the more central part of London,\r\nassuming 100,000 houses to be drained into the sewers, and each of such\r\ndrains to be on the average 50 feet long, is, then, 5,000,000 feet, or\r\nabout 2840 miles.\r\n\r\nBut there are still the street or gully-drains for the surface-water to\r\nbe estimated. In the Holborn and Finsbury division alone, the length\r\nof the “main covered sewers” is said to be 83 miles; the length of\r\n“smaller sewers” to carry off the surface-water from the streets 16\r\nmiles; the length of drains leading from houses to the main sewers, 264.\r\n\r\nNow, if there be 16 miles of gully-drains to 83 miles of main covered\r\nsewers, and the same proportion hold good throughout the 58 square\r\nmiles over which the sewers extend, it follows that there would be\r\nabout 200 miles of gully-drains to the gross 1100 miles of sewers.\r\n\r\nBut this is only an approximate result. The length and character of the\r\ngully-drains I find to vary very considerably. If the streets where the\r\ngully-grates are found have no sewer in a line with the thoroughfare,\r\nstill the water must be drained off and conveyed to the nearest sewer,\r\nof any class, large or small, and consequently at much greater length\r\nthan if there were a sewer running down the street. Neither is the\r\nnumber of the gully-holes any sure criterion of the measurement of the\r\ngully-drains, for where the intersections are, and consequently the\r\ngully-holes frequent, a number, sometimes amounting to ten, are made to\r\nempty their contents into the same gully-drain. Neither do the returns\r\nof yearly expenditure, presented to Parliament by the Metropolitan\r\nCourt of Sewers, supply information. But even if the exact length, and\r\nthe exact price paid for the formation of that length, were given,\r\nit would supply but _the year’s_ outlay as regards the additions or\r\nrepairs that had been made to the gully-drains, and certainly not\r\nfurnish us with the original cost of the whole.\r\n\r\nOne experienced informant told me--but let me premise that I heard\r\nfrom all the gentlemen whom I consulted, a statement that they could\r\nonly compute by analogy with other facts bearing upon the subject--was\r\nconfident, that taking only 1200 miles of public way as gully-drained,\r\nthat extent might be considered as the length of the gully-drains\r\nthemselves. Even calculating such drains to run from each side of the\r\npublic way, which is generally the case, I am told that, considering\r\nthe economy of underground space which is now necessary, the length of\r\n1200 miles is as fair an estimate for gully-drainage (apart from other\r\ndrainage) as for the length of the streets so gullied.\r\n\r\nHence we have, for the gross extent of the whole sewers and drains of\r\nthe metropolis, the following result,--\r\n\r\n                                      Miles.\r\n    Main covered sewers                1100\r\n    House-drains                       2840\r\n    Gully-drains for surface-water of\r\n  streets                              1200\r\n                                       ----\r\n    Total length of the sewers and\r\n  drains of the metropolis             5140\r\n\r\nThe island of Great Britain, I may observe, is, at its extreme\r\npoints, 550 miles from north to south, and 290 from east to west. It\r\nwould, therefore, appear that the main sewers of the capital are just\r\ndouble the length of the whole island, from the English Channel to\r\nJohn-o’-Groats, and nearly three times longer than the greatest width\r\nof the country. But this is the extent of the sewerage alone. The\r\ndrainage of London is about equal in length to the diameter of the\r\nearth itself!\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COST OF CONSTRUCTING THE SEWERS AND DRAINS OF THE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\nThe money actually expended in constructing the 1100 miles of sewers\r\nand 4000 miles of drains, even if we were only to date from Jan. 1,\r\n1800, is not and never can be known. They have been built at intervals,\r\nas the metropolis, so to speak, _grew_. They were built also in many\r\nsizes and forms, and at many variations of price, according to the\r\ndepth from the surface, the good or bad management, or the greater or\r\nlesser extent of jobbery or “patronage” in the several independent\r\ncommissions. Accounts were either not presented in “the good old\r\ntimes,” or not preserved.\r\n\r\nHad the 1100 miles of sewers to be constructed anew, they would\r\nbe, according to the present prices paid by the Commissioners--not\r\nincluding digging or such extraneous labour, but the cost of the sewer\r\nonly--as follows:--\r\n\r\n    366 miles of sewers of the first\r\n  class, or 1,932,480 feet, at 15_s._\r\n  per foot                                   £1,449,360\r\n    366 miles, or 1,932,480 feet of\r\n  the second class, at 11_s._ per foot        1,062,864\r\n    Same length of third class, at\r\n  9_s._ per foot                                869,616\r\n                                             ----------\r\n    Total cost of the sewers of the\r\n  metropolis                                 £3,381,840\r\n\r\nAs this is a lower charge than was paid for the construction of more\r\nthan three-fourths of the sewers, we may fairly assume that their cost\r\namounted to from three millions and a half to four millions of pounds\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the house-drains running into the sewers are brick, and\r\nseldom less than 9 inches square; sometimes, in the old brick drains,\r\nthey are some inches larger, and in the very old drains, and in some\r\n100 years old, wooden planks were often used instead of a brick or\r\nstone construction, for the sake of reducing cost, and replaced when\r\nrotted. The wood, in many cases, soon decayed, and since 1847 no wooden\r\nsewers have been allowed to be formed, nor any old ones to be repaired\r\nwith new wood; the work must be of stone or brick, if not pipeage.\r\nAbout two-thirds of the drains running from the houses to the sewers\r\nare brick; the remaining third tubular, or earthenware pipes. The cost,\r\nif now to be formed, would be somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1893-1/3 miles of brick drains, 5_s._\r\n  per foot, as average of sizes              £2,499,200\r\n    945-2/3 feet of tubular drains, average\r\n  of sizes 2_s._ 6_d._                          624,800\r\n                                             -----------\r\n    Total cost of the house-drains of\r\n  London                                     £3,124,000\r\n\r\nThe cost of the street or gully drains have still to be estimated.\r\n\r\nThe present cost of the 9-inch gully-pipe drains is about 3_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nfoot; of the 6-inch, 2_s._ 6_d._ Of the proportionate lengths of these\r\ntwo classes of street-drains I have not been able to gain any account,\r\nfor, I believe, it has never been ascertained in any way approaching\r\nto a total return. Taking 1200 miles, however, as quite within the\r\nfull length of the gully-drains, and calculating at the low average of\r\n3_s._ the foot for the whole, the total cost of the street-drains of\r\nthe metropolis would be 950,400_l._, or, I am assured, one might say a\r\nmillion sterling, and this, even if all were done at the present low\r\nprices; the original cost would, of course, have been much greater.\r\n\r\nHence, according to the above calculations, we have the following\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gross Estimate of the Cost of the Sewers and Drains of the Metropolis._\r\n\r\n                                                £\r\n  1100 miles of main covered sewers         3,500,000\r\n  2840 miles of house-drains                3,000,000\r\n  1200 miles of gully or street drains      1,000,000\r\n  ----                                      ---------\r\n  5140 miles of sewers and drainage =       7,500,000\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE USES OF SEWERS AS A MEANS OF SUBSOIL DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nThere is one other purpose toward which a sewer is available--a\r\npurpose, too, which I do not remember to have seen specified in the\r\nMetropolitan Reports.\r\n\r\n“The first, and perhaps most important purpose of sewers, as respects\r\nhealth,” says the Report of Messrs. Walker, Cubitt, and Brunel\r\n(1848), “is, _as under-drains to the surrounding earth_. They answer\r\nthis purpose so effectually and quietly, and have done it so long,\r\nthat their importance in this respect is overlooked. In the Sanitary\r\nCommissioners’ Reports we do not find it once noticed, and the\r\nrecommendation of the substitution of stone or earthenware pipes for\r\nthe larger brick sewers, seems to show, that any provision for the\r\n_under-drainage_ was thought unnecessary, although such a provision is\r\nin our opinion most important.\r\n\r\n“Under the artificial ground, the collection of ages, which in the\r\nCity of London, as in most ancient towns, forms the upper surface, is\r\na considerable thickness of clean gravel, and under the gravel is the\r\nLondon clay. The present houses are founded chiefly on the artificial\r\nor ‘made ground,’ while the sewers are made through the gravel; and\r\nit is known practically, that however charged with water the gravel\r\nof a district may be, the springs for a considerable distance round\r\nare drawn down by making a sewer, and the wells that had water within\r\na few feet of the surface have again to be sunk below the bottom of\r\nthe sewer to reach the water. Every interstice between the stones of\r\nthe gravel acts as an under-drain to conduct the water to the sewer,\r\nthrough the sides of which it finds its way, even if mortar be used in\r\nthe construction.\r\n\r\n“Hence the salubrity of a gravel foundation, if the water be drawn\r\nout of it by sewers or other means, as is the case with the City and\r\nwith Westminster. A proof of this principle was afforded by the result\r\nof a reference to physicians and engineers in 1838, to inquire into\r\nthe state of drainage and smells in and near Buckingham Palace, as to\r\nwhich there had been complaints, though none so heavy as Mr. Phillips\r\nnow makes, when he says, ‘that the drainage of Buckingham Palace is\r\nextremely defective, and that its precincts are reeking with filth and\r\npestilential odours from the absence of proper sewerage!’”\r\n\r\nThe Report then shows the pains that were taken to ensure dryness in\r\nthe Palace. Pits were dug in the garden 14 feet below the surface, and\r\n3-1/2 feet below high-water mark in the river, and they were found dry\r\nto the bottom. The kitchens and yard of the palace are, however, only\r\n18 inches above Trinity high-water mark in the Thames, and therefore\r\n18 inches below a very high tide. The physician, Sir James Clarke, and\r\nthe engineers, Messrs. Simpson and Walker, in a separate Report, spoke\r\nin terms of commendation of the drainage of the Palace in 1838, as\r\npromotive of dryness. Since that time a connecting chain has been made\r\nfrom the Palace drains into the canal in St. James’s-park, to prevent\r\nthe wet from rising as formerly during heavy rains. “The Palace,” it\r\nis stated in the Report of the three engineers, “should not be classed\r\nwith the low part of Pimlico, where the drainage is, we believe, very\r\ndefective, and to which, for anything we know to the contrary, the\r\ncharacter given by Mr. Phillips may be applicable.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, for this array of opinions of high authority,\r\nand despite the advantages of a gravel bed for the substratum of the\r\npalatial sewerage, the drainage and sewerage about Buckingham Palace\r\nis more frequently than that of any other public place under repair,\r\nand is always requiring attention. It was only a few days ago, before\r\nthe court left Windsor Castle for London, that men were employed night\r\nand day, on the drains and cesspoolage channels, to make, as one of\r\nthem described it to me--and such working-men’s descriptions are often\r\nforcible--“the place _decent_. I was hardly ever,” he added, “in such a\r\nset of stinks as I’ve been in the sewers and underground parts of the\r\npalace.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CITY SEWERAGE.\r\n\r\nAs yet I have spoken only of the sewers of London[64] “without the\r\nCity;” but the sewers within the City, though connected, for the\r\ngeneral public drainage and sewerage of the capital, with the works\r\nunder the control of the Metropolitan Commissioners, are in a distinct\r\nand strictly defined jurisdiction, superintended by City Commissioners,\r\nand managed by City officers, and consequently demand a special notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe account of the City sewers, however, may be given with a\r\ncomparative brevity, for the modes of their construction, as well as\r\ntheir general management, do not differ from what I have described as\r\npertaining to the extra-civic metropolis. There are, nevertheless, a\r\nfew distinctions which it is proper to point out.\r\n\r\nThe City sewers are the oldest in the capital, for the very plain\r\nreason that the City itself, in its site, if not now in its public and\r\nprivate buildings, is the oldest part of London, as regards the abode\r\nof a congregated body of people.\r\n\r\nThe ages (so to speak) of these sewers, vary, for the most part,\r\naccording to the dates of the City’s rebuilding after the Great Fire,\r\nand according to the dates of the many alterations, improvements,\r\nremoval or rebuilding of new streets, markets, &c., which have been\r\neffected since that period. Before the Great Fire of 1666, all drainage\r\nseems, with a few exceptions, to have been fortuitous, unconnected, and\r\nsuperficial.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ public sewer built after this important epoch in the\r\nhistory of London was in Ludgate-street and hill. This was the laudable\r\nwork of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s, and was constructed at the\r\ninstance, it is said, and after the plans, of Sir Christopher Wren.\r\nThere is, perhaps, no official or documentary proof of this, for the\r\nproclamations from the King in council, the Acts of Parliament, and the\r\nresolutions of the Corporation of the City of London at that important\r\nperiod, are so vague and so contradictory, and were so frequently\r\naltered or abrogated, and so frequently disregarded, that it is more\r\nimpossible than difficult to get at the truth. Of the fact which I have\r\njust mentioned, however, there need be no doubt; nor that the _second_\r\npublic City sewer was in Fleet-street, commenced in 1668, the second\r\nyear after the fire.\r\n\r\nThere are, nevertheless, older sewers than this, but the dates of their\r\nconstruction are not known; we have proof merely that they existed in\r\nold London, or as it was described by an anonymous writer (quoted, if\r\nI remember rightly, in Maitland’s “History of London”), London “_ante\r\nignem_”--London before the fire. These sewers, or rather portions of\r\nsewers, are severally near Newgate, St. Bartholomew’s Hospital sewer,\r\nand that of the Irongate by the Tower.\r\n\r\nThe sewer, however, which may be pointed out as the most remarkable is\r\nthat of Little Moorgate, London-wall. It is formed of red tiles; and\r\nfrom such being its materials, and from the circumstance of some Roman\r\ncoins having been found near it, it is supposed by some to be of Roman\r\nconstruction, and of course coeval with that people’s possession of the\r\ncountry. This sewer has a flat bottom, upright sides, and a circular\r\narch at its top; it is about 5 feet by 3 feet. The other older sewers\r\npresent much about the same form; and an Act in the reign of Charles\r\nII. directs that sewers shall be so built, but that the bottom shall\r\nhave a circular curve.\r\n\r\nI am informed by a City gentleman--one taking an interest in such\r\nmatters--that this sewer has troubled the repose of a few civic\r\nantiquaries, some thinking that it was a Roman sewer, while others\r\nscouted such a notion, arguing that the Romans were not in the habit\r\nof doing their work by halves; and that if they had sewered London,\r\ngreat and enduring remains would have been discovered, for their main\r\nsewer would have been a solid construction, and directed to the Thames,\r\nas was and is the Cloaca Maxima, in the Eternal City, to the Tiber.\r\nOthers have said that the sewer in question was merely built of Roman\r\nmaterials, perhaps first discovered about the time, having originally\r\nformed a reservoir, tank, or even a bath, and were keenly appropriated\r\nby some economical or scheming builder or City official.\r\n\r\n“That the Britons,” says Tacitus in his “Life of Agricola,” “who led\r\na roaming life, and were easily incited to war, might contract a love\r\nfor peace, by being accustomed to a pleasanter mode of life, Agricola\r\nassisted them to build houses, temples, and market-places. By praising\r\nthe diligent and upbraiding the idle, he excited such emulation among\r\nthe Britons, that, after they had erected all those necessary buildings\r\nin their towns, they built others for pleasure and ornament, as\r\nporticoes, galleries, _baths_, and banqueting-houses.”\r\n\r\nThe sewers of the city of London are, then, a comparatively modern\r\nwork. Indeed, three-fourths of them may be called modern. The earlier\r\nsewers were--as I have described under the general head--ditches, which\r\nin time were arched over, but only gradually and partially, as suited\r\nthe convenience or the profit of the owners of property alongside\r\nthose open channels, some of which thus presented the appearance of\r\na series of small uncouth-looking bridges. When these bridges had to\r\nbe connected so as to form the summit of a continuous sewer, they\r\npresented every variety of arch, both at their outer and under sides;\r\nthose too near the surface had to be lowered. Some of these sewers,\r\nhowever, were in the first instances connected, despite difference\r\nof size and irregularity of form. The result may be judged from the\r\naccount I have given of the strange construction of some of the\r\nWestminster sewers, under the head of “subterranean survey.”\r\n\r\nHow modern the City sewers are may best be estimated from the following\r\ntable of what may be called the dates of their construction. The\r\nperiods are given decennially as to the progress of the formation of\r\n_new_ sewers:--\r\n\r\n                    Feet.\r\n  1707 to 1717      2,805\r\n  1717 „  1727      2,110\r\n  1727 „  1737      2,763\r\n  1737 „  1747      1,238\r\n  1747 „  1757      3,736\r\n  1757 „  1767      3,736\r\n  1767 „  1777      7,597\r\n  1777 „  1787      8,693\r\n  1787 „  1797      3,118\r\n  1797 „  1807      5,116\r\n  1807 „  1817      5,097\r\n  1817 „  1827      7,847\r\n                  -------\r\n                   52,810\r\n\r\n  1827 to 1837     39,072 feet.\r\n  1837 to 1847     88,363  „\r\n                  -------\r\n                  127,435\r\n\r\nThus the length made in the 20 years previous to 1847 was more than\r\ndouble all that was made during the preceding 120 years; while in the\r\nten years from 1837 to 1847, the addition to the lineal extent of\r\nsewerage was very nearly equal to all that had been made in 130 years\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nThis addition of 127,435 feet, or rather more than 24 miles, seems but\r\na small matter when “London” is thought of; but the reader must be\r\nreminded that only a small portion (comparatively) of the metropolis\r\nis here spoken of, and the entire length of the City sewerage, at the\r\nclose of 1847, was but 44 miles; so that the additions I have specified\r\nas having been made since 1837, were more than one-half of the whole.\r\nThe _re_-constructions are not included in the metage I have given,\r\nfor, as the new sewers generally occupied the same site as the old,\r\nthey did not add to the length of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe total length of the City sewerage was, on the 31st December, 1851,\r\nno less than 49 miles; while the entire public way was at the same\r\nrecent period, 51 miles (containing about 1000 separate and distinct\r\nstreets, lanes, courts, alleys, &c., &c.); and I am assured that in\r\nanother year or so, not a furlong of the whole City will be unsewered.\r\n\r\nThe more ancient sewers usually have upright walls, a flat or\r\nslightly-curved invert, and a semicircular or gothic arch. The form of\r\nsuch as have been built apparently more than 20 years ago, is that of\r\ntwo semicircles, of which the upper has a greater radius, connected by\r\nsloping side walls; those of recent construction are egg-shaped. The\r\nmain lines are not unfrequently elliptic; in the case of the Fleet,\r\nand other ancient affluents of the Thames, the forms and dimensions\r\nvary considerably. Instances occur of sewers built entirely of stone;\r\nbut the material is almost invariably brick, most commonly 9 inches in\r\nsubstance; the larger sewers 14, and sometimes 18 inches.\r\n\r\nThe falls or inclinations in the course of the City sewerage vary\r\ngreatly, as much as from 1 in 240 to 1 in 24, or, in the first case,\r\nfrom a fall of 22 feet, in the latter, of course, to ten times such\r\nfall, or 220 feet per mile. There are, moreover, a few cases in which\r\nthe inclination is as small as 1 in 960; others where it is as high as\r\n1 in 14. This irregularity is to be accounted for, partly by the want\r\nof system in the old times, and partly from the natural levels of the\r\nground. The want of system and the indifference shown to providing a\r\nproper fall, even where it was not difficult, was more excusable a few\r\nyears back than it would be at the present time, for when some of these\r\nsewers were built, the drainage of the house-refuse into them was not\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\nThe number of houses drained into the City sewers is, as precisely\r\nas such a matter can be ascertained, 11,209; the number drained into\r\nthe cesspools is 5030. This shows a preponderance of drainage into\r\nthe sewers of 6179. The length of the house-drains in the City, at an\r\naverage of 50 feet to each house, may be estimated at upwards of 106\r\nmiles. These City drains are included in the general computation of the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nThe gully-drains in the City are more frequent than in other parts\r\nof the metropolis, owing to the continual intersection of streets,\r\n&c., and perhaps from a closer care of the sewerage and all matters\r\nconnected with it. The general average of the gully-drains I have\r\nshown to be 59 for every mile of street. I am assured that in the\r\nCity the street-drains may be safely estimated at 65 to the mile.\r\nEstimating the streets gullied within the City, then, at an average\r\nof 50 miles, or about a mile more than the sewers, the number of\r\ngully-drains is 3250, and the length of them about 50 miles; but these,\r\nlike the house-drains, have been already included in the metropolitan\r\nenumeration.\r\n\r\nThe actual sum expended yearly upon the construction, and repairs,\r\nand improvements of the City sewers cannot be cited as a distinct\r\nitem, because the Court makes the return of the aggregate annual\r\nexpenditure, as regards pavement, cleansing, and the matters specified\r\nas the general expenditure under the Court of Commissioners of the City\r\nSewers. The cost, however, of the construction of sewers comprised\r\nwithin the civic boundaries is included in the general metropolitan\r\nestimate before given.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE OUTLETS, RAMIFICATIONS, ETC., OF THE SEWERS.\r\n\r\nIn this enumeration I speak only of the _public_ outlets into the\r\nriver, controlled and regulated by public officers.\r\n\r\nThe orifices or mouths of the sewers where they discharge themselves\r\ninto the Thames, beginning from their eastern, and following them\r\nseriatim to their western extremity, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Limehouse Hole.\r\n  Irongate Wharf.\r\n  Ratcliffe Cross.\r\n  Fox-lane, Shadwell.\r\n  London Dock.\r\n  St. Katharine’s Dock.\r\n  The eleven City outlets, which I shall specify hereafter.\r\n  Essex-street, Strand.\r\n  Norfolk-street, Strand.\r\n  Durham Hill (or Adelphi).\r\n  Northumberland-street.\r\n  Scotland-yard.\r\n  Bridge-street, Westminster.\r\n  Pimlico.\r\n  Cubitt’s (also in Pimlico).\r\n  Chelsea Bridge.\r\n  Fulham Bridge.\r\n  Hammersmith Bridge.\r\n  Sandford Bridge (into a sort of creek of the Thames), or near the four bridges.\r\n  Twickenham.\r\n  Hampton.\r\n  In all, 32.\r\n\r\nIt might only weary the reader to enumerate the outlets on the Surrey\r\nside of the Thames, which are 28 in number, so that the public sewer\r\noutlets of the whole metropolis are 60 in all.\r\n\r\nThe public sewer outlets from the City of London into the Thames\r\nare, as I have said, eleven in number, or rather they are usually\r\nrepresented as eleven, though in reality there are twelve such\r\norifices--the “Upper” and “Eastern” Custom-House Sewers (which are\r\ndistinct) being computed as one. These outlets, generally speaking the\r\nmost ancient in the whole metropolis, are--\r\n\r\n  London Bridge.\r\n  Ancient Walbrook.\r\n  Paul’s Wharf.\r\n  The Fleet-street Sewer at Blackfriars Bridge.\r\n  (I mention these four first, because they are the largest outlets).\r\n  Tower Dock.\r\n  Pool Quay.\r\n  Custom House.\r\n  New Walbrook.\r\n  Dowgate Dock.\r\n  Hamburg Wharf.\r\n  Puddle Dock.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, there was also Whitefriars Docks, but this is now\r\nattached to the Fleet Sewer outlet.\r\n\r\nThe Fleet Sewer is the oldest in London. No portion of the ditch or\r\nriver composing it is now uncovered within the jurisdiction of the\r\nCity; but until a little more than eleven years ago a portion of it,\r\nnorth of Holborn, was uncovered, and had been uncovered for years.\r\nIndeed, as I have before intimated, barges and small craft were\r\nemployed on the Fleet River, and the City determined to “encourage its\r\nnavigation.” Even the “polite” Earl of Chesterfield, a century ago\r\n(for his lordship was born in 1694, and died in 1773), when asked by a\r\nFrenchman in Paris, if there was in London a river to compare to the\r\nSeine? replied that there certainly was, and it was called Fleet Ditch!\r\nThis is now the sewer; but it was not a covered sewer until 1765, when\r\nthe Corporation ordered it to be built over.\r\n\r\nThe next oldest sewer outlet is that at London Bridge, and London\r\nantiquaries are not agreed as to whether it or the Fleet is the oldest.\r\n\r\nThe Fleet Sewer at Blackfriars Bridge is 18 feet high; between\r\nTudor-street and Fleet Bridge (about the foot of Ludgate-hill), 14 feet\r\n3 inches high; at Holborn Bridge, 13 feet; and in its continuation in\r\nthe long-unfinished Victoria-street, 12 feet 3 inches. In all these\r\nlocalities it is 12 feet wide.\r\n\r\nThe New London Bridge Sewer, built or rebuilt, wholly or partly, in\r\n1830, is 10 feet by 8 at its outlet; decreasing to the south end of\r\nKing William-street, where it is 9 feet by 7; while it is 8 feet by 7\r\nin Moorgate-street.\r\n\r\nPaul’s Wharf sewer is 7 feet 6 inches by 5 feet 6 inches near the\r\noutlet.\r\n\r\nWith the one exception of the Fleet River, none of the City sewer\r\noutlets are covered, the Fleet outlet being covered even at low water.\r\nThe issue from the others runs in open channels upon the shore.\r\n\r\nMr. Haywood (February 12, 1850), in a report of the City Sewer\r\nTransactions and Works, observes,--“During the year (1849) the outlet\r\nsewers at Billingsgate and Whitefriars, two of the outlets of main\r\nsewers which discharged at the line of the River Wall, have been\r\ndiverted (times of storm excepted); there remain, therefore, but\r\neleven main outlets within the jurisdiction of this commission, which\r\ndischarge their waters at the line of the River Wall.\r\n\r\n“As a temporary measure, it is expedient to convey the sewage of\r\nthe whole of the outlets within the City by covered culverts, below\r\nlow-water mark; this subject has been under the consideration both of\r\nthis Commission and the Navigation Committee.”\r\n\r\nWhether the covered culvert is better than the open run, is a matter\r\ndisputed among engineers (as are very many other matters connected with\r\nsewerage), and one into which I need not enter.\r\n\r\nMr. Haywood says further:--“The Fleet sewer already discharges its\r\naverage flow, by a culvert, below low-water mark; with one exception\r\nonly, I believe, none of the numerous outlets, which, for a length of\r\nmany miles, discharge at intervals into the Thames at the line of the\r\nRiver Wall, both within and without your jurisdiction, discharge by\r\nculverts in a similar manner.”\r\n\r\nThese eleven outlets are far from being the whole number which give\r\ntheir contents into “the silver bosom of the Thames,” along the\r\nbank-line of the City jurisdiction. There are (including the 11) 182\r\noutlets; but these are not under the control (unless in cases of\r\nalteration, nuisance, &c.) of the Court of Sewers. They are the outlets\r\nfrom the drainage of the wharfs, public buildings, or manufactories\r\n(such as gas-works, &c.) on the banks of the river; and the right to\r\nform such outlets having been obtained from the Navigation Committee,\r\nwho, under the Lord Mayor, are conservators of the Thames, the care of\r\nthem is regarded as a private matter, and therefore does not require\r\nfurther notice in this work. The officers of the City Court of Sewers\r\nobserve these outlets in their rounds of inspection, but interfere\r\nonly on application from any party concerned, unless a nuisance be in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nTo convey a more definite notion of the extent and ramified sweep of\r\nthe sewers, I will now describe (for the first time in print) some\r\nof the chief _Sewer Ramifications_, and then show the proportionate\r\nor average number of public ways, of inhabited houses, and of the\r\npopulation to each great main sewer, distinguishing, in this instance,\r\nthose as _great main sewers_ which have an outlet into the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe reader should peruse the following accounts with the assistance\r\nof a map of the environs, for, thus aided, he will be better able to\r\nform a definite notion of the curiously-mixed and blended extent of the\r\nsewerage already spoken of.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, as to the ramifications of the great and ancient Fleet\r\noutlet. From its mouth, so to speak, near Blackfriars Bridge, its\r\ncourse is not parallel with any public way, but, running somewhat\r\nobliquely, it crosses below Tudor-street into Bridge-street,\r\nBlackfriars, then occupies the centre of Farringdon-street, and\r\nthat street’s prolongation or intended prolongation into the New\r\nVictoria-street (the houses in this locality having been pulled down\r\nlong ago, and the spot being now popularly known as “the ruins”),\r\nand continues until the City portion of the Fleet Sewer meets the\r\nMetropolitan jurisdiction between Saffron and Mutton hills, the\r\njunction, so to call it, being “under the houses”[65] (a common phrase\r\namong flushermen). A little farther on it connects itself with an\r\nopen part of the Fleet Ditch, running at the back of Turnmill-street,\r\nClerkenwell. In its City course, the sewer receives the issue from 150\r\npublic ways (including streets, alleys, courts, lanes, &c.), which\r\nare emptied into it from the second, third, or smaller class sewers,\r\nfrom Ludgate-hill and its proximate streets, the St. Paul’s locality,\r\nFleet-street and its adjacent communications in public ways, with\r\na series of sewers running down from parts of Smithfield, &c. The\r\n_greatest_ accession of sewage, however, which the Fleet receives from\r\n_one_ issue, is a few yards beyond where the City has merged into the\r\nMetropolitan jurisdiction; this accession is from a first-class sewer,\r\nknown as “the Whitecross-street sewer,” because running from that\r\nstreet, and carrying into the Fleet the contributions of 60 crowded\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nAfter the junction of the covered City sewer with the uncovered ditch\r\nin Clerkenwell, the Fleet-river sewer (again covered) skirts round Cold\r\nBath Fields Prison (the Middlesex House of Correction), runs through\r\nClerkenwell-green into the Bagnigge Wells-road, so on to Battle-bridge\r\nand King’s-cross; then along the Old Saint Pancras-road, and thence\r\nto the King’s-road (a name now almost extinct), where the St. Pancras\r\nWorkhouse stands close by the turnpike-gate. Along Upper College-street\r\n(Camden-town) is then the direction of this great sewer, and running\r\n_under_ the canal at the higher part of Camden-town, near the bridge\r\nby the terminus of the Great North Western Railway, it branches into\r\nthe highways and thoroughfares of Kentish-town, of Highgate, and of\r\nHampstead, respectively, and then, at what one informant described as\r\n“the outside” of those places, receives the open ditches, which form\r\nthe further sewerage, under the control of the Commissioners, who cause\r\nthem to be cleansed regularly.\r\n\r\nIn order to show more consecutively the direction, from place to place,\r\nin straight, devious, or angular course, of this the most remarkable\r\nsewer of the world, considering the extent of the drainage into it, I\r\nhave refrained from giving beyond the Whitecross-street connection with\r\nthe Fleet, an account of the number of streets sewered into this old\r\ncivic stream. I now proceed to supply the deficiency.\r\n\r\nFrom a large outlet at Clerkenwell-green (a very thickly-built\r\nneighbourhood) flows the connected sewage of 100 streets. At\r\nMaiden-lane, beyond King’s-cross, a district which is now being built\r\nupon for the purposes of the Great Northern Railway, the sewage of\r\n10 streets is poured into it. In the course of this sewer along\r\nCamden-town, it receives the issue of some 20 branches, or 40 streets,\r\n&c. About 15 other issues are received before the open ditches of\r\nKentish-town, Highgate, and Hampstead are encountered.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, merely the sewage collected in the precincts of\r\nthe City proper, which is “outletted” (as I heard a flusherman call\r\nit) into the Thames. Other districts are drained into the large City\r\noutlets nearing the river. “Many of your works,” says Mr. Haywood,\r\nthe City surveyor, in a report addressed to the City Commissioners,\r\nOct. 23, 1849, “have been beneficially felt by districts some miles\r\ndistant from the City. Twenty-nine outlets have been provided by you\r\nfor the sewage of the County of Middlesex; the high land of and about\r\nHampstead, drains through the Fleet sewer; Holloway and a portion of\r\nIslington can now be drained by the London Bridge sewer; Norton Folgate\r\nand the densely-populated districts adjacent are also relieved by it.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Irongate sewer (one of the most important),\r\nwhich has its outlet in the Tower Hamlets, drains a portion of the City.\r\n\r\nThe reader must bear in mind, also, that were he to traverse the Fleet\r\nsewer in the direction described--for all the men I conversed with on\r\nthe subject, if asked to show the course of sewerage with which they\r\nwere familiar, began _from_ the outlet into the Thames--the reader, I\r\nsay, must remember that he would be advancing all the way _against_ the\r\nstream, in a direction in which he would find the sewage flowing onward\r\nto its mouth, while his course would be towards its sources.\r\n\r\nOn the left-hand side (for the account before given refers only to the\r\nright-hand side) proceeding in the same direction, after passing the\r\nunderground precincts of the City proper, there is another addition\r\nnear Saffron-hill, of the sewage of 30 streets; then at Gray’s-inn-road\r\nis added the sewage of 100 streets; New-road (at King’s-cross), 20\r\nmore streets; from the whole of Somers-town, a populous locality,\r\nthe sewerage concentrating all the busy and crowded places round\r\nabout “the Brill,” &c., the sewage of 120 streets is received; and at\r\nPratt-street, Camden-town, 12 other streets.\r\n\r\nThus into this sewage-current, directed to one final outlet, are\r\ndrained the refuse of 517 streets, including, of course, a variety of\r\nminor thoroughfares, courts, alleys, &c., &c., as in the neighbourhoods\r\nof Gray’s-inn-road, in Clerkenwell, Somers-town, &c. Some of these\r\ntributaries to the efflux of the sewage are “barrel-drains,” but\r\nperform the function of sewers along small courts, where there is “no\r\nthoroughfare” either _upon_, or _below_ the surface.\r\n\r\nThe London Bridge sewer runs up King William-street to Moorgate-street,\r\nalong Finsbury-square into the City-road, diverging near the\r\nWharf-road, which it crosses _under_ the canal near the Wenlock basin,\r\nand thence along the Lower-road, Islington, by Cock-lane, through\r\nHighbury-vale; after this, at the extremity of Holloway, the open\r\nditches, as in the former instance, carry on the conveyance of sewage\r\nfrom the outer suburbs.\r\n\r\nThe King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer--which seems to have given the\r\nCommissioners more trouble than any other, in its connection\r\nwith Buckingham Palace, St. James’s Park, and the new Houses of\r\nParliament--runs from Chelsea-bridge past Cubitt’s workshops, and along\r\nthe King’s-road to Eaton-square, the whole of which is drained into it;\r\nthen “turning round,” as one man described it, it approaches Buckingham\r\nPalace, which, with its grounds, as well as a portion of St. James’s\r\nand the Green parks, is drained into this sewer; then branching away\r\nfor the reception of the sewage from the houses and gardens of Chelsea,\r\nit drains Sloane-street, and, crossing the Knightsbridge-road, runs\r\nthrough or across Hyde-park to the Swan at Bayswater, whence its course\r\nis by the Westbourne District and under the canal, along Paddington,\r\nuntil it attains the open country, or rather the grounds, in that\r\nquarter, which have been very extensively and are now still being built\r\nover, and where new sewers are constructed simultaneously with new\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nThus in the “reach,” as I heard it happily enough designated, of each\r\nof these great sewers, the reader will see from a map the extent of the\r\nsubterranean metropolis traversed, alike along crowded streets ringing\r\nwith the sounds of traffic, among palatial and aristocratic domains,\r\nand along the parks which adorn London, as well as winding their\r\nramifying course among the courts, alleys, and teeming streets, the\r\nresorts of misery, poverty, and vice.\r\n\r\nEstimating, then, the number of sewers from the number of their river\r\noutlets, and regarding all the rest as the branches, or tributaries,\r\nto each of these superior streams, we have, adopting the area before\r\nspecified as being drained by the metropolitan sewers, viz., 58 square\r\nmiles, the following results:--\r\n\r\nEach of the 60 sewers having an outlet into the Thames drains 618\r\nstatute acres.\r\n\r\nAnd assuming the number of houses included within these 58 square\r\nmiles to be 200,000, and the population to amount to 1,500,000, or\r\ntwo-thirds of the houses and people included in the Registrar-General’s\r\nMetropolis, we may say that each of the 60 sewers would carry into the\r\nThames the refuse from 25,000 individuals and 3333 inhabited houses.\r\nThis, however, is partly prevented by the cesspoolage system, which\r\nsupplies receptacles for a proportion of the refuse that, were London\r\nto be rebuilt according to the provisions of the present Building and\r\nSanitary Acts, would _all_ be carried, without any interception, into\r\nthe river Thames by the media of the sewers.\r\n\r\nIn my account of cesspoolage I shall endeavour to show the extent of\r\nfæcal refuse, &c., contained in places not communicating with the\r\nsewers, and to be removed by the labour of men and horses, as well as\r\nthe amount of fæcal refuse carried into the sewerage.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE QUALITIES, ETC., OF THE SEWAGE.\r\n\r\nThe question of the value, the uses, and the best means of collecting\r\nfor use, the great mass of the sewage of the metropolis, seems to have\r\nbecome complicated by the statements which have been of late years put\r\nforth by rival projectors and rival companies. In our smaller country\r\ntowns, the neighbourhood of many being remarkable for fertility and for\r\na green beauty of meadow-land and pasturage, the refuse of the towns,\r\nwhether sewage or cesspoolage (if not washed into a current, stream,\r\nor river), is purchased by the farmers, and carted by them to spread\r\nupon the land.\r\n\r\nBy _sewage_, I mean the contents of the _sewerage_, or of the series\r\nof sewers; which neither at present nor, I believe, at any former\r\nperiod, has been applied to any useful or profitable purpose by the\r\nmetropolitan authorities. The readiest mode to get rid of it, without\r\nany care about ultimate consequences, has always been resorted to, and\r\nthat mode has been to convey it into the Thames, and leave the rest to\r\nthe current of the stream. But the Thames has its ebbs as well as its\r\nflow, and the consequence is the sewage is _never_ got rid of.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of our engineers have agreed that it is a very\r\nimportant consideration how this sewage should be not only innocuously\r\nbut profitably disposed of; and if not profitably, in an immediate\r\nmoney return, to those who may be considered its owners (the municipal\r\nauthorities of the kingdom), at least profitably in a national point of\r\nview, by its use in the restoration or enrichment of the fertility of\r\nthe soil, and the consequent increase of the food of man and beast.\r\n\r\nSir George Staunton has pronounced some of the tea-growing parts of\r\nChina to be as blooming as an English nobleman’s flower-garden. Every\r\njot of manure, human ordure, and all else, is minutely collected, even\r\nby the poorest.\r\n\r\nI have already given a popular account of the composition of the\r\nmetropolitan sewage, &c. (under the head of Wet Refuse), and I now give\r\nits scientific analysis.\r\n\r\nIn some districts the sewage is more or less liquid--in what proportion\r\nhas not been ascertained--and I give, in the first place, an analysis\r\nof the sewage of the King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer, Westminster, the\r\nresult having been laid before a Committee of the House of Commons.\r\nAs the contents of the great majority of sewers _must_ be the same,\r\nbecause resulting from the same natural or universally domestic\r\ncauses (as in the refuse of cookery, washing, surface-water, &c.),\r\nthe analysis of the sewage of the King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer may be\r\naccepted as one of sewer-matter generally.\r\n\r\nEvidence was given before the committee as to the proportion of\r\n“land-drainage _water_” to what was really _manure_, in the matter\r\nderived from the sewer in question. A produce of 140 grains of manure\r\nwas derived from a gallon of sewer-water. Messrs. Brande and Cooper,\r\nthe analyzers, also state that one gallon (10 lbs.?) of the liquid\r\nportion of the sewage, evaporated to dryness, gave 85·3 grains of solid\r\nmatter, 74·8 grains of which was again soluble, and contained--\r\n\r\n  Ammonia              3·29\r\n  Sulphuric acid       0·62\r\n  Phosphate of lime    0·29\r\n  Lime                 6·25\r\n  Chlorine            10·00\r\n\r\n“and potass and soda, with a large quantity of soluble and vegetable\r\nmatter, and 10·54 insoluble.”\r\n\r\nThis insoluble portion consisted of\r\n\r\n  Phosphate of lime    2·32\r\n  Carbonate of lime    1·94\r\n  Silica               6·28\r\n                      -----\r\n                      10·54\r\n\r\nThe deposit from another gallon weighed 55 grains, of which 21·22 were\r\ncombustible, being composed of animal matter “rich in nitrogen,” some\r\nvegetable matter, and a quantity of fat. Of this matter 33·75 grains\r\nconsisted of\r\n\r\n  Phosphate of lime          6·81\r\n  Oxide of iron              2·01\r\n  Carbonate of lime          1·75\r\n  Sulphate of lime           1·53\r\n  Earthy matter and sand    21·65\r\n                            -----\r\n                            33·75\r\n\r\nOther Reports and other evidence show that what is described as “earthy\r\nmatter and sand” is the mac, mud, and the mortar or concrete used\r\nin pavement, washed from the surface of the streets into the sewers\r\nby heavy rains; otherwise for the most part the proper load of the\r\nscavager’s cart.\r\n\r\nFurther analyses might be adduced, but with merely such variation in\r\nthe result as is inevitable from the state of the weather when the\r\nsewage is drawn forth for examination; whether the day on which this is\r\ndone happens to be dry or wet[66].\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained, but the exact proportion is not, and perhaps\r\ncannot be, given, that the extent of covered to uncovered surface in\r\nthe district drained by the King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer was as 3 to 1,\r\nwhile that of the Ranelagh Sewer, not far distant, was as 1 to 3, at\r\nthe time of the inquiry (1848).\r\n\r\n“It could not be expected, therefore,” says the Report, “that the\r\nRanelagh Sewer (which, moreover, is open to the admission of the tide\r\nat its mouth), in the quantity or quality of the manure produced, could\r\nbear any proportion to the King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer.”\r\n\r\nMr. Smith, of Deanston, stated in evidence, that the average quantity\r\nof rain falling into King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer was 139,934,586 cubic\r\nfeet in a year, and he assumes 6,000,000 tons as the amount of average\r\nminimum quantity of drainage (yearly), yielding 4 cwt. of solid matter\r\nin each 100 tons = 1 in 500.\r\n\r\nDr. Granville said, on the same inquiry, that he should be sorry to\r\nreceive on his land 500 tons of diluted sewer water (such as that from\r\nthe uncovered Ranelagh Sewer) for 1 ton of really fertilizing sewage,\r\nsuch as that to be derived from the King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer.\r\n\r\nI could easily multiply these analyses, and give further parliamentary\r\nor official statements, but, as the results are the same, I will merely\r\ngive some extracts from the evidence of Dr. Arthur Hassall, as to the\r\nmicroscopic constituents of sewage-water:--\r\n\r\n“I have examined,” he said, “the sewer-water of several of the\r\nprincipal sewers of London. I found in it, amongst many other things,\r\nmuch decomposing vegetable matter, portions of the husks and the hairs\r\nof the down of wheat, the cells of the potato, cabbage, and other\r\nvegetables, while I detected but few forms of animal life, those\r\nencountered for the most part being a kind of worm or anælid, and a\r\ncertain species of animalcule of the genus monas.”\r\n\r\n“How do you account,” the Doctor was asked, “for the comparative\r\nabsence of animal life in the water of most sewers?” “It is, doubtless,\r\nto be attributed,” he replied, “in a great measure, to the large\r\nquantity of sulphuretted hydrogen contained in sewer-water, and which\r\nis continually being evolved by the decomposing substances included in\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any evidence to show that sewer-water does contain\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen in such large quantity as to be prejudicial and\r\neven fatal to animal life?” “With a view of determining this question,\r\nI made the following experiments:--A given quantity of Thames water,\r\nknown to contain living infusoria, was added to an equal quantity of\r\nsewer-water; examined a few minutes afterwards, the animalculæ were\r\nfound to be either dead or deprived of locomotive power and in a dying\r\nstate. A small fish, placed in a wine glass of sewer-water, immediately\r\ngave signs of distress, and, after struggling violently, floated on its\r\nside, and would have perished in a few seconds, had it not been removed\r\nand placed in fresh water. A bird placed in a glass bell-jar, into\r\nwhich the gas evolved by the sewer-water was allowed to pass, after\r\nstruggling a good deal, and showing other symptoms of the action of the\r\ngas, suddenly fell on its side, and, although immediately removed into\r\nfresh air, was found to be dead. These experiments were made, in the\r\nfirst instance, with the sewer water of the Friar-street sewer (near\r\nthe Blackfriars-road); they were afterwards repeated with the water\r\nof six other sewers on the Middlesex side, and with the same result,\r\nas respects the animalculæ and fish, but not the bird; this, although\r\nevidently much affected by the noxious emanations of the sewer-water,\r\nyet survived the experiment.”\r\n\r\n“Would you infer from these experiments that sewer-water, as contained\r\nin the Thames near to London, is prejudicial to health?” “I would, most\r\ndecidedly; and regard the Thames in the neighbourhood of the metropolis\r\nas nothing less than diluted sewer-water.”\r\n\r\n“You have just stated that you found sewer-water to contain much\r\nvegetable matter, and but few forms of animal life; the vegetable\r\nmatter you recognised, I presume, by the character of the cells\r\ncomposing the several vegetable tissues?” “Yes, as also by the action\r\nof iodine on the starch of the vegetable matter.”\r\n\r\n“In what way do you suppose these various vegetable cells, the husks of\r\nwheat, &c., reach the sewers?” “They doubtless proceed from the fæcal\r\nmatter contained in sewage, and not in general from the ordinary refuse\r\nof the kitchen, which usually finds its way into the dust-bin.”\r\n\r\n“Sewer-water, then, although containing but few forms of animal life,\r\nyet contains, in large quantities, the food upon which most animalculæ\r\nfeed?” “Yes; and it is this circumstance which explains the vast\r\nabundance of infusorial life in the water of the Thames within a few\r\nmiles of London.”\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman (a fellow of the Linnæan Society, and the author of\r\n“A History of the British Fresh-water Algæ,” or water-weeds considered\r\npopularly), in answer to the following inquiries in connection with\r\nthis subject, also said:--\r\n\r\n“What species of infusoria represent the _highest_ degree of impurity\r\nin water?” “The several species of the genera _Oxytricha_ and\r\n_Paramecium_.”\r\n\r\n“What species is most abundant in the Thames from Kew Bridge to\r\nWoolwich?” “The _Paramecium Chrysalis_ of Ehrenberg; this occurs in\r\nall seasons of the year, and in all conditions of the river, in vast\r\nand incalculable numbers; so much so, that a quart bottle of Thames\r\nwater, obtained in any condition of the tide, is sure to be found, on\r\nexamination with the microscope, to contain these creatures in great\r\nquantity.”\r\n\r\n“Do you find that the infusorium of which you have spoken varies in\r\nnumber in the different parts of the river between Kew Bridge and\r\nWoolwich?” “I find that it is most abundant in the neighbourhood of the\r\nbridges.” [Where the outlet of the sewers is common.]\r\n\r\n“Then the order of impurity of Thames water, in your view, would be the\r\norder in which it approaches the centre of London?” “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You find then, in Thames water, about the bridges, things decidedly\r\nconnected with the _sewer water_, as vegetable and animal matter\r\nin a state of decomposition?” “I do; about the bridges, and in the\r\nneighbourhood of London, there is very little living vegetable matter\r\non which animalculæ could live; the only source of supply which they\r\nhave is _the organic matter contained in sewer-water_, and which is to\r\nbe regarded as the food of these creatures. Where infusoria abound,\r\nunder circumstances _not_ connected with sewage, vegetable matter in a\r\nliving condition is certain to be met with.”\r\n\r\nRespecting the _uses of the sewage_, I may add the following brief\r\nobservations. Without wishing in any way to prejudice the question\r\n(indeed the reader will bear in mind that I have all along spoken\r\nreprovingly of the waste of sewage), I am bound to say that the\r\nopinions I heard during my inquiry from gentlemen scientifically and,\r\nin some instances, practically familiar with the subject, concurred in\r\nthe conclusion that the _sewage_ of the metropolis cannot, with all\r\nthe applications of scientific skill and apparatus, be made either\r\nsufficiently portable or efficacious for the purposes of manure to\r\nassure a proper pecuniary return. In this matter, perhaps, speculators\r\nhave not traced a sufficient distinction between the liquid manure of\r\nthe sewers and the “_poudrette_,” or dry manure, manufactured from the\r\nmore solid excrementitious matter of the cesspools, not only in Paris,\r\nbut, until lately, even in London, where the business was chiefly in\r\nthe hands of Frenchmen. The staple of the French “_poudrette_” is\r\n_not_ “_sewage_,” that is, the outpourings of the sewers--for this is\r\ncarried into the Seine, and washed away with little inconvenience,\r\nas the tide hardly affects that river in Paris; but it is altogether\r\n“_cesspoolage_,” that is, the deposit of the cesspools, collected in\r\nfixed and moveable utensils, regulated by the “universal” police of\r\nParis, and conveyed by Government labourers to the Voirées, which are\r\nhuge reservoirs of nightsoil at Montfauçon, about five miles, and\r\nin the Forest of Bondy, about ten miles, from the centre of Paris.\r\nThe London-made manure also was all of cesspoolage; the contents of\r\nthe nightman’s cart being “shot” in the manufacturer’s yard; and\r\nwhen so manufactured was, I believe, without exception, sent to the\r\nsugar-growing colonies, the farmers in the provinces pronouncing it\r\n“too hot” for the ground. The same complaint, I may observe, has been\r\nmade of the French manufactured cesspool manure. I heard, on the other\r\nhand, opinions from scientific and practical gentlemen, that the\r\nsewer-water of London was so diluted, it was not profitably serviceable\r\nfor the irrigation of land. All, however, agreed that the sewage of the\r\nmetropolis ought not to be wasted, as it was certain that perseverance\r\nin experiment (and perhaps a large outlay) were certain to make sewage\r\nof value.\r\n\r\nThe following results, which the Board of Health have just issued in a\r\nReport, containing “Minutes of Information attested on the Application\r\nof Sewer-water and Town Manures to Agricultural Production,” supply\r\nthe latest information on this subject. The Report says first, that\r\n“to be told that the average yield of a county is 30 bushels of wheat\r\nper acre, or that the average weight of the turnip crop is 15 tons\r\nper acre, means very little, and there is little to be learned from\r\nsuch intelligence; but if it is shown that a certain farm under the\r\nusual mode of culture yielded certain weights per acre, and that the\r\nsame land, by improved applications of the same manure, by the use of\r\nmachinery, and by _employing double the number of hands, at increased\r\nwages_, is made to yield _four fold_ the weight of crop and of _better\r\nquality_ than was previously obtained, a lesson is set before us worth\r\nlearning.”\r\n\r\nIt then proceeds to cite the following statements, on the authority of\r\nthe Hon. Dudley Fortescue, as to the efficiency of sewage-water as a\r\nliquid manure applied to land.\r\n\r\n“The first farm we visited was that of Craigentinney, situated about\r\none mile and a half south-east of Edinburgh, of which 260 Scotch acres”\r\n(a Scotch acre is one-fourth more than any English acre) “receive a\r\nconsiderable proportion of such sewerage as, under an imperfect system\r\nof house-drainage, is at present derived from half the city. The\r\nmeadows of which it chiefly consists have been put under irrigation\r\nat various times, the most recent addition being nearly 50 acres laid\r\nout in the course of last year and the year previous, which, lying\r\nabove the level of the rest, are irrigated by means of a steam-engine.\r\nThe meadows first laid out are watered by contour channels following\r\nthe inequalities of the ground, after the fashion commonly adopted\r\nin Devonshire; but in the more recent parts the ground is disposed\r\nin ‘panes’ of half an acre, served by their respective feeders, a\r\nplan which, though somewhat more expensive at the outset, is found\r\npreferable in practice. The whole 260 acres take about 44 days to\r\nirrigate; the men charged with the duty of shifting the water from\r\none pane to another give to each plot about two hours’ irrigation\r\nat a time; and the engine serves its 50 acres in ten days, working\r\nday and night, and employing one man at the engine and another to\r\nshift the water. The produce of the meadows is sold by auction on the\r\nground, ‘rouped,’ as it is termed, to the cow-feeders of Edinburgh,\r\nthe purchaser cutting and carrying off all he can during the course of\r\nthe letting, which extends from about the middle of April to October,\r\nwhen the meadows are shut up, but the irrigation is continued through\r\nthe winter. The lettings average somewhat over 20_l._ the acre; the\r\nhighest last year having brought 31_l._, and the lowest 9_l._; these\r\nlast were of very limited extent, on land recently denuded in laying\r\nout the ground, and consequently much below its natural level of\r\nproductiveness. There are four cuttings in the year, and the collective\r\nweight of grass cut in parts was stated at the extraordinary amount of\r\n80 tons the imperial acre. The only cost of maintaining these meadows,\r\nexcept those to which the water is pumped by the engine, consists in\r\nthe employment of two hands to turn on and off the water, and in the\r\nexpense of clearing out the channels, which was contracted for last\r\nyear at 29_l._, and the value of the refuse obtained was considered\r\nfully equal to that sum, being applied in manuring parts of the land\r\nfor a crop of turnips, which with only this dressing in addition\r\nto irrigation with the sewage-water presented the most luxuriant\r\nappearance. The crop, from present indications, was estimated at from\r\n30 to 40 tons the acre, and was expected to realize 15_s._ the ton\r\nsold on the land. From calculations made on the spot we estimated the\r\nproduce of the meadows during the eight months of cutting at the keep\r\nof ten cows per acre, exclusive of the distillery refuse they consume\r\nin addition, at a cost of 1_s._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ per head per week. The\r\nsea-meadows present a particularly striking example of the effects of\r\nthe irrigation; these, comprising between 20 and 30 acres skirting the\r\nshores between Leith and Musselburgh, were laid down in 1826 at a cost\r\nof about 700_l._; the land consisted formerly of a bare sandy tract,\r\nyielding almost absolutely nothing; it is now covered with luxuriant\r\nvegetation extending close down to high-water mark, and lets at an\r\naverage of 20_l._ per acre at least. From the above statement it will\r\nbe seen how enormously profitable has been the application in this case\r\nof town refuse in the liquid form; and I have no hesitation in stating\r\nthat, great as its advantages have been, they might be extended four\r\nor five fold by greater dilution of the fluid. Four or five times the\r\nextent of land might, I believe, be brought into equally productive\r\ncultivation under an improved system of drainage in the city, and a\r\nmore abundant use of water. Besides these Craigentinney meadows, there\r\nare others on this and on the west side of Edinburgh, which we did\r\nnot visit, similarly laid out, and I believe realizing still larger\r\nprofits, from their closer proximity to the town, and their lying\r\nwithin the toll-gates.”[67]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are said to be the results of a practical application of\r\nsewer-water. The preliminary remark of the Board of Health, however,\r\napplies somewhat to the statement above given; for we are not told what\r\nthe _same land_ produced before the liquid manure was applied; nor are\r\nwe informed as to the peculiar condition and quantity of the land near\r\nCraigentinney, and how it differs from the land near London.\r\n\r\nThe other returns are of liquid manures, of which sewer-water formed no\r\npart, and, therefore, require no special notice of them. The following\r\nobservations are, however, worthy of attention:--\r\n\r\n“The cases above detailed furnish some measure of the possible\r\nresults attainable in cultivation, especially corroborated as they\r\nare by others which did not on this occasion come under our personal\r\nobservation, but one of which I may mention, having recently examined\r\ninto it, that of Mr. Dickinson, at Willesden, who estimates his yield\r\nof Italian rye-grass at from 80 to 100 tons an acre, and gets 8 or\r\n10 cuttings, according to the season; and as there is no peculiar\r\nadvantage of soil or climate (the former ranging from almost pure sands\r\nto cold and tenacious clays, and the latter being inferior to that of\r\na large proportion of England) to prevent the same system being almost\r\nuniversally adopted, they give some idea of the degree to which the\r\nproductiveness of land may be raised by a judicious appliance of the\r\nmeans within our reach. When it is considered that such results may,\r\nin the vicinity of towns and villages, be most effectually brought\r\nabout by the instant removal of all those matters which, when allowed\r\nto remain in them, are among the most fruitful sources of social\r\ndegradation, disease, and death, one cannot but earnestly desire\r\nthe furtherance of such measures as will ensure this double result\r\nof purifying the town and enriching the country; and as the facts I\r\nhave stated came at the same time under the notice of the gentleman I\r\nmentioned above, under whose able superintendence the arrangements for\r\nthe water-supply and drainage of several towns are now in course of\r\nexecution, I trust it will not be long before this most advantageous\r\nmode of disposing of the refuse of towns may be brought into practical\r\noperation in various parts of the country.\r\n\r\n  “I have, &c.,\r\n\r\n  “D. F. FORTESCUE.\r\n\r\n“General Board of Health.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE NEW PLAN OF SEWERAGE.\r\n\r\nThis branch of the subject hardly forms part of my present inquiry,\r\nbut, having pointed out the defects of the sewers, it seems but\r\nreasonable and right to say a few words on the measures determined\r\nupon for their improvement. It is only necessary for me, however, to\r\nindicate the principal characteristics of the new, or rather intended,\r\nmode of sewerage, as the work may be said to have been but commenced,\r\nor hardly commenced in earnest, the Report of Mr. Frank Forster (the\r\nengineer) bearing the date of Jan. 30, 1851.\r\n\r\nIn the carrying out of the engineer’s plan--which from its magnitude,\r\nand, in all human probability, from its cost, when completed, would\r\nbe _national_ in other countries, but is here only _metropolitan_--in\r\nthe carrying out of this scheme, I say, two remarkable changes will be\r\nfound. The one is the employment of the power of steam in sewerage; the\r\nother is the diversion of the sewage from the current of the Thames.\r\nThe ultimate uses of this sewage, agriculturally or otherwise, form no\r\npart of the present consideration.\r\n\r\nI should, however, first enumerate the general principles on which\r\nthe best authorities have agreed that the London sewers should be\r\nconstructed so as to ensure a proper disposal of the sewage, for these\r\nprinciples are said to be at the basis of Mr. Forster’s plan.\r\n\r\nI condense under the following heads the substance of a mass of\r\nReports, Committee Meetings, Suggestions, Plans, &c.:--\r\n\r\n1. The channels, or pipeage, or other means of conveying away\r\nhouse-refuse, should be so made that the removal will be _immediate_,\r\nmore especially of any refuse or filth capable of suspension in water,\r\nsince its immediate carrying off, it is said, would leave no time for\r\nthe generation of miasma.\r\n\r\n2. Means should be provided for such disposal of sewage as would\r\nprevent its tainting any stream, well, or pool, or, by its stagnation\r\nor obstruction, in any way poisoning the atmosphere. And, as a natural\r\nand legitimate result, it should be _so collected that it could be\r\napplied to the cultivation of the land_ at the most economical rate.\r\n\r\n3. In the providing works of deposit or storage in low districts, or\r\n“of discharge where the natural outlets are free,” such works should\r\nbe provided as would not subject any place, or any man’s property, to\r\nthe risk of inundation, or any other evil consequence; while in the\r\nconstruction of the drainage of the substratum, the works should be\r\nat such a depth below the foundation of all buildings that tenements\r\nshould not be exposed to that continued damage from exhalation and\r\ndampness which leads to the dry rot in timber, and to an immature decay\r\nof materials and a general unhealthiness.\r\n\r\nThere are other points insisted upon in many Reports to which I need\r\nbut allude, such as\r\n\r\n(_a._) The channels containing sewage should be of enduring and\r\nimpermeable material, so as to prevent all soakage.\r\n\r\n(_b._) There should be throughout the channels of the subterranean\r\nmetropolis a fall or inclination which would suffice to prevent the\r\naccumulation of any sewage deposit, with its deleterious influence and\r\nultimate costliness.\r\n\r\n(_c._) Similar provisions should be used were it but to prevent\r\nthe creation of the noxious gases which now permeate many houses\r\n(especially in the quarters inhabited by the poor) and escape into\r\nmany streets, courts, and alleys, for until improvements are effected\r\nthe pent-up sewage and the saturated brickwork of the sewers and older\r\ndrains must generate such gases.\r\n\r\n(_d._) No tidal stream should ever receive a flow of sewage, because\r\nthen the cause of evil is never absent, for the filth comes back\r\nwith the tide; and as the Thames water constitutes the grand fount\r\nof metropolitan consumption, the water companies, with very trifling\r\nexceptions, give us back much of our own excrement, mixed with every\r\nconceivable, and sometimes noxious, nastiness, with which we may brew,\r\ncook, and wash--and drink, if we can. Filtering remedies but a portion\r\nof the evil.\r\n\r\nNow it would appear that not one of these requirements, the necessity\r\nof which is unquestioned and unquestionable, is fully carried out by\r\nthe present system of sewerage, and hence the need of some new plan in\r\nwhich the defects may be remedied, and the proper principles carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given by the Court were to the following effect:--\r\n\r\nA. The Thames should be kept free from sewage whatever the state of the\r\ntide.\r\n\r\nB. There should be intercepting drains to carry off the sewage (so\r\nkeeping the Thames unsoiled by it) wherever practicable.\r\n\r\nC. The sewage should be raised by artificial means into a main channel\r\nfor removal.\r\n\r\nD. The intercepting sewers should be so constructed as to secure the\r\nlargest amount of effective drainage without artificial appliances.\r\n\r\nIn preparing his plan, Mr. Forster had the advice and assistance of Mr.\r\nHaywood, of the City Court of Sewers.\r\n\r\nThe metropolis is divided into two portions--“the northern portion of\r\nthe metropolis,” or rather that portion of the metropolis which is on\r\nthe north or Middlesex bank of the Thames; and the southern portion, or\r\nthat which is on the south or Surrey side of the river.\r\n\r\nThe northern portion is in the new plan considered to “divide itself\r\ninto two separate areas,” and to these two areas different modes of\r\nsewerage are to be applied:\r\n\r\n“1. The interception of the drainage of that district, which, from\r\nits elevation above the level of the outlet, is capable of having its\r\nsewage and rainfall carried off by gravitation.\r\n\r\n“2. The interception of the drainage of that district, which, from its\r\nlow lying position, will require its sewage, and in most localities its\r\nrainfall, to be lifted by steam-power to a proper level for discharge.”\r\n\r\nThe first district runs from Holsden-green (beyond the better-known\r\nKensall-green) in the west, to the Tower Hamlets in the east. Its\r\nform is irregular, but not very much so, merely narrowing from\r\nWestbourn-green to its western extremity, the country then becoming\r\nrural or woodland. Its highest reaches to the north are to Highgate and\r\nStamford-hill. The nearest approach to the south is to a portion of\r\nthe Strand, between Charing-cross and Drury-lane. Care has evidently\r\nbeen taken to skirt this district, so to speak, by the canals and the\r\nrailroads. This division of the northern portion is described as “the\r\ndistrict for natural drainage.”\r\n\r\nThe area of this division is about 25-1/6 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe second division meets the first at the highway separating\r\nKensington-gardens from Bayswater; and runs on, bordering the river,\r\nall the way to the West India Dock. Its shape is irregular, but,\r\nabating the roundness, presents somewhat of that sort of figure seen\r\nin the instrument known as a dumb-bell, the narrowest or hand-part\r\nbeing that between Charing-cross and Drury-lane, skirting the river\r\nas its southern bound. At its eastern end this second district widens\r\nabruptly, taking in Victoria-park, Stratford, and Bromley.\r\n\r\nThe area of this division of the northern portion is 16-1/8 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, two small tracts, comprising the southern part of\r\nthe Isle of Dogs, and a narrow slip on the west side of the river Lea,\r\nwhich are intended to allow the rainfall to run into the Thames and the\r\nLea respectively.\r\n\r\nThe area of the two is 1-3/4 square mile.\r\n\r\nThe area to be drained by natural outfall comprises, then, 25-1/6\r\nsquare miles as regards rainfall, and the same extent as regards\r\nsewage; while the area to the drainage of which steam power is to\r\nbe applied comprises 14-1/3 square miles of rainfall, and 16-1/6\r\nsquare miles of sewage; the two united areas of rainfall and sewage\r\nrespectively being 39-1/2 and 41-1/3 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe length of the great “high-level sewerage” will be, as regards the\r\nmain sewer, 19 miles and 106 yards; that of the “low-level sewerage,”\r\n14 miles and 1501 yards.\r\n\r\nI will now describe the course of each of these constructions.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern bank of the Lea the sewage of both districts is to\r\nbe concentrated. The high-level sewer will commence and _cross_ the\r\nLea near the “Four Mills.” It is then to proceed “in a westerly\r\ndirection under the East and West India Dock Railway and the Blackwall\r\nExtension Railway, beneath the Regent’s-canal, to the east end of the\r\nBethnal-green-road, at the crossing of the Cambridge-heath-road, at\r\nwhich point it will be joined by the proposed northern division of the\r\nHackney-brook, which drains an extensive district up to the watershed\r\nline north of London, including Hackney, Stoke Newington and Holloway,\r\nand part of Highgate and Hampstead; from thence the main sewer proceeds\r\nalong the Bethnal-green-road, Church-street, Old-street, Wilderness-row\r\n(where a short branch from Coppice-row will join) to Brook-street-hill;\r\nfrom thence to Little Saffron-hill, where a distance of about 100 yards\r\nis proposed to be carried by an aqueduct over the Fleet-valley; thence\r\nalong Liquorpond-street, at the end of which it will receive a branch\r\nfrom Piccadilly, on the south side, and a diversion of the Fleet-river,\r\non the north side; thence along Theobald’s-road, Bloomsbury-square,\r\nHart-street, New Oxford-street, to Rathbone-place (where it will\r\nreceive a diversion of the Regent-street sewer from Park-crescent),\r\nalong Oxford-street, and extending thence across Regent-circus to\r\nSouth Molton-lane (where it will intercept the King’s Scholars’ Pond\r\nsewer), continuing still along Oxford-street to Bayswater-place, Grand\r\nJunction-road, Uxbridge-road, where it is joined by the Ranelagh sewer,\r\nthe sewage of which it is capable of receiving, and at this point it\r\nterminates.”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey to a reader, especially to a reader who\r\nmay not be familiar with the localities of London generally, any\r\nadequate notion of the largeness, speaking merely of extent, of this\r\nundertaking. Even a map conveys no sufficient idea of it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may best be able to suggest to a reader’s mind a knowledge\r\nof this largeness, when I state that in the district I have just\r\ndescribed, which is but _one_ portion (although the greatest) of the\r\nsewerage of but _one_ side of the Thames, more than half a million of\r\npersons, and nearly 100,000 houses are, so to speak, to be sewered.\r\n\r\nThe low-level tract sewerage, also, concentrates on the Lea, “near to\r\nFour Mill’s distillery, taking the north-western bank of the Limehouse\r\nCut, at which point it receives the branch intended to intercept\r\nthe sewage of the Isle of Dogs; thence continuing along the bank of\r\nLimehouse Cut, through a portion of the Commercial-road, Brook-street,\r\nand beneath the Sun Tavern Fields, into High-street, or Upper\r\nShadwell; thence along Ratcliffe-highway and Upper East Smithfield,\r\nacross Tower-hill, through Little and Great Tower-streets, Eastcheap,\r\nCannon-street, Little and Great St. Thomas Apostle, Trinity-lane, Old\r\nFish-street, and Little Knight Rider-street; thence beneath houses in\r\nWardrobe-terrace, and on the eastern side of St. Andrew’s-hill, along\r\nEarl-street to Blackfriars-road. From Blackfriars Bridge it is proposed\r\nto construct the sewer along the river shore to the junction of the\r\nVictoria-street sewer at Percy-wharf; which sewer between Percy-wharf\r\nand Shaftesbury-terrace, Pimlico, becomes thus an integral portion of\r\nthe intercepting line; at Bridge-street, Westminster, a branch from\r\nthe Victoria-street sewer is intended to proceed along Abingdon and\r\nMillbank-streets, as far as and for the purpose of taking up the King’s\r\nScholars’ Pond and other sewers at their outlets into the Thames.\r\nFrom Shaftesbury-terrace the Victoria-street sewer is proposed to be\r\nextended through Eaton-square and along the King’s-road, Chelsea, to\r\nPark-walk, intercepting all the sewers along its line, and terminating\r\nat a point where the drainage of Kensington may be brought into it\r\nwithout pumping.”\r\n\r\nThe lines of sewerage thus described are, then, all to the _west_ of\r\nthe Lea, and all, whether from the shore of the Thames, or the northern\r\nreaches in Highgate and Hampstead, converging to a pumping station\r\nor sewage-concentration, on the _east_ bank of the Lea, in West Ham.\r\nBy this new plan, then, the high-level sewer is to _cross_ the Lea,\r\nbut that arrangement is impossible as respects the second district\r\ndescribed, which is _below_ the level of the Lea, so that its course\r\nis to be _beneath_ that river, a little below where it is crossed by\r\nthe high-level line. To dispose of the sewage, therefore, conveyed from\r\nthe low-level tract, there will be a sewer of a “depth of _forty-seven_\r\nfeet _below_” the invert of the high-level sewer. This sewer, then, at\r\nthe depth of 47 feet, will run to the point of concentration containing\r\nthe low-level sewage.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the works, in order that the sewage may be collected,\r\nso as to be disposed of ultimately in one mass, it has to be _lifted_\r\nfrom the low to the high-level sewer. The invert of the high-level\r\nsewer will at the lifting or pumping station be 20 feet _above_ the\r\nordnance datum, while that of the low-level sewer will be 27 feet\r\n_below_ the same standard. Thus a great body of metropolitan sewage,\r\ncomprising among other districts the refuse of the whole City of\r\nLondon, must be lifted no less than 47 feet, in order to be got rid of\r\nalong with what has been carried to the same focus by its natural flow.\r\n\r\nThe lifting is to be effected by means of steam, and the pumping power\r\nrequired has been computed at 1100-horse power. To supply this great\r\nmechanical and scientific force, there are to be provided two engines,\r\neach of 550-horse power, with a third engine of equal capacity, to be\r\navailable in case of accident, or while either of the other engines\r\nmight require repairs of some duration.\r\n\r\nThe northern sewage of London (or that of the Middlesex bank of the\r\nThames, covered by that division of the capital) having been thus\r\nbrought to a sort of central reservoir, or meeting point, will be\r\nconveyed in two parallel lines of sewerage to the bank of the river\r\nRoding, being the eastern extremity of Gallion’s Reach (which is below\r\nWoolwich Reach), in the Thames. The Roding flows into the Thames at\r\nBarking Creek mouth. The length of this line will be four miles.\r\n\r\n“At this point,” it is stated in the Report, “the level of the inverts\r\nof the parallel sewers will be eight feet below high-water mark, and\r\nhere it is intended to collect the sewage into a reservoir during\r\nthe flood-tide, and discharge the same with the ebb-tide immediately\r\nafter high-water; and, as it is estimated that the reservoir will be\r\ncompletely emptied during the first three hours of the ebb, it may be\r\nsafely anticipated that no portion of the sewage will be returned, with\r\nthe flood-tide, to within the bounds of the metropolis.”\r\n\r\nThe whole of the sewage and rainfall, then, will be thus diverted to\r\n_one_ destination, instead of being issued into the river through a\r\nmultiplicity of outlets in every part of the northern shore where the\r\npopulation is dense, and will be carried into the Thames at Barking\r\nCreek, unless, as I have intimated, a market be found for the sewage;\r\nwhen it may be disposed of as is most advantageous. The only exceptions\r\nto this carrying off will be upon the occurrence of long-continued and\r\nheavy rains or violent storms, when the surplus water will be carried\r\noff by some of the present outlets into the river; but even on such\r\noccasions, the _first scour_ or cleansings of the sewerage will be\r\nconveyed to the main outlet at the river Roding.\r\n\r\nThe inclination which has been assigned to the whole of the lines\r\nof sewers I have described, is, with some unimportant exceptions, 4\r\nfeet per mile, or 1 in 1320. These new sewers are, or rather will be,\r\ncalculated to carry off a fall of rain, equal to 1/4 inch in 24 hours,\r\nin addition to the average daily flow of sewage.\r\n\r\nMr. Forster concludes his Report:--“I am only able to submit\r\napproximately that I estimate the cost of the whole of the lines\r\nof sewers, the pumping engines, and station, the reservoir, tidal\r\ngates, and other apparatus, at one million and eighty thousand pounds\r\n(1,080,000_l._). This estimate does not include the sums required for\r\nthe purchase of land and houses, which may be needed for the site of\r\nthe pumping engine-house, or compensation for certain portions of the\r\nlines of sewers.”\r\n\r\nAs regards the improvements in the sewerage on the south side of the\r\nThames (the great fever district of the metropolis, and consequently\r\nthe most important of all, and where the drainage is of the worst\r\nkind), I can be very brief, as nothing has been positively determined.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar system will be adopted on the south side of the\r\nThames, where it is proposed to form one main intercepting sewer; but,\r\nowing to the physical configuration of this part of the town, none\r\nof the water will flow away entirely by gravitation. There will be a\r\npumping station on the banks of the Ravensbourne, to raise the water\r\nabout 25 feet; and a second pumping station to raise the water from\r\nthe continued sewer in the reservoir, in Woolwich Marsh, which is to\r\nreceive it during the intervals of the tides. The waters are to be\r\ndischarged into the river at the last-named point. The main sewer on\r\nthe south side will be of nearly equally colossal proportions; for its\r\ntotal length is proposed to be about 13 miles 3 furlongs, including the\r\nmain trunk drain of about 2 miles long, and the respective branches.\r\nThe area to be relieved is about proportionate to the length of the\r\ndrain; but the steam power employed will be proportionally greater upon\r\nthe southern than upon the northern side.\r\n\r\nThere are divers opinions, of course, as to the practicability and\r\nultimate good working of this plan; speculations into which it is\r\nnot necessary for me to enter. Mr. Forster has, moreover, resigned\r\nhis office, adding another to the many changes among the engineers,\r\nsurveyors, and other employés under the Metropolitan Commission; a fact\r\nlittle creditable to the management of the Commissioners, who, with one\r\nexception, may be looked upon as irresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE SEWERS AND THE LATE COMMISSIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Corporation of the City of London may be regarded as the first\r\nCommission of Sewers in the exercise of authority over such places as\r\nregards the removal of the filth of towns. In time, but at what time\r\nthere is no account, the business was consigned to the management of\r\na committee, as are now the markets of the City (Markets Committee),\r\nand even what may be called the management of the Thames (Navigation\r\nCommittee). It is not at all necessary that the members of these\r\ncommittees should understand anything about the matters upon which\r\nthey have to determine. A staff of officers, clerks, secretaries,\r\nsolicitors, and surveyors, save the members the trouble of thought\r\nor inquiry; they have merely to vote and determine. It was stated in\r\nevidence before a Select Committee of the House of Commons on the\r\nsubject of the Thames steamers, that at that period the Chairman of\r\nthe _Navigation_ Committee was a bread and biscuit baker, but “a\r\nvery-firm-minded man.” In time, but again I can find no note of the\r\nprecise date, the _Committee_ became a _Court_ of Sewers, and so it\r\nremains to the present time. Commissions of sewers have been issued\r\nby the Crown since the 25th year of the reign of Henry VIII., except\r\nduring the era of the Commonwealth, when there seems to have been no\r\nattention paid to the matter.\r\n\r\nAs the metropolis increased rapidly in size since the close of the\r\nlast century, the public sewers of course increased in proportion,\r\nand so did Commissions of Sewers in the newly-built districts. Up to\r\n1847 these Commissions or Court of Sewers were _eight_ in number, the\r\nmetropolis being divided into that number of districts.\r\n\r\nThe districts were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. The City.\r\n  2. The Tower Hamlets.\r\n  3. St. Katherine.\r\n  4. Poplar and Blackwall.\r\n  5. Holborn and Finsbury.\r\n  6. Westminster and part of Middlesex.\r\n  7. Surrey and Kent.\r\n  8. Greenwich.\r\n\r\nEach of these eight Commissions had its own Act of Parliament; its\r\nown distinct, often irregular and generally uncontrolled plan of\r\nmanagement; each had its own officers; and each had its own patronage.\r\nEach district court--with almost unlimited powers of taxation--pursued\r\nits own plans of sewerage, little regardful of the plans of its\r\nneighbour Commission. This wretched system--the great recommendation\r\nof which, to its promoters and supporters, seems to have been\r\npatronage--has given us a sewerage unconnected and varying to the\r\npresent day in almost every district; varying in the dimensions, form,\r\nand inclination of the structures.\r\n\r\nThe eight commission districts, I may observe, had each their\r\nsub-districts, though the general control was in the hands of the\r\nparticular Court or Board of Commissioners for the entire locality.\r\nThese subdivisions were chiefly for the facilities of rate-collecting,\r\nand were usually “western,” “eastern,” and “central.”\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this immethodical system has been that, until the\r\nsurveys and works now in progress are completed, the precise character,\r\nand even the precise length, of the sewers must be unknown, though a\r\nsufficient approximation may be deduced in the interim.\r\n\r\nTo show the conflicting character of the sewerage, I may here observe\r\nthat in some of the old sewers have been found walls and arches\r\ncrumbling to pieces. Some old sewers were found to be not only of ample\r\nproportions, but to contain subterranean chambers, not to say halls,\r\nfilled with filth, into which no man could venture. While in a sewer in\r\nthe newly-built district of St. John’s-wood, Mr. Morton, the Clerk of\r\nWorks, could only advance stooping half double, could not turn round\r\nwhen he had completed his examination, but had most painfully--for a\r\nlong time feeling the effects--to back out along the sewer, stooping,\r\nor doubled up, as he entered it. Why the sewer was constructed in this\r\nmanner is not stated, but the work appears, inferentially, to have been\r\n_scamped_, which, had there been a proper supervision, could hardly\r\nhave been done with a modern public sewer, down a thoroughfare of some\r\nlength (the Woronzow-road).\r\n\r\nBut the conflicting and disjointed system of sewerage was not the sole\r\nevil of the various Commissions. The mismanagement and jobbery, not to\r\nsay peculation, of the public moneys, appear to have been enormous.\r\nFor instance, in the “Accountant’s Report” (February, 1848), prepared\r\nby Mr. W. H. Grey, 48, Lincoln’s-inn-fields, I find the following\r\nstatements relative to the _Book-keeping_ of the several Commissions:--\r\n\r\n“The _Westminster_ plan is full of unnecessary repetition. It is\r\ndeficient in those real general accounts which concentrate the\r\ninformation most needed by the Commissioners, and it contains\r\n_fictions_ which are very inconsistent with any sound system of\r\nbook-keeping.\r\n\r\n“The ledger of the Westminster Commission does not give a true account\r\nof the actual receipt and expenditure of each district.\r\n\r\n“The _Holborn and Finsbury_ books are still more defective than\r\nthose of the Westminster Commission.... There are the same kind of\r\n_fictions_.... But the extraordinary defect in these books consists in\r\nthe utter want of system throughout them, by keeping one-sided accounts\r\nonly in the ledger, with respect to the different sewers in each\r\ndistrict, showing only the amount _expended_ on each.\r\n\r\n“The _Tower Hamlets_ books have been kept on a regular system, though\r\nby no means one conveying much general information.”\r\n\r\n“With respect to the _Surrey and Kent_ accounts,” says Mr. Grey,\r\n“the books produced are the most incomplete and unsatisfactory that\r\never came under my observation. The ledger is always thought to be a\r\n_sine quâ non_ in book-keeping; but here it has been dispensed with\r\naltogether, for that which is so marked is no ledger at all.”\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the Report continues, “It cannot be wondered\r\nat that debts should have been incurred, or that they should have\r\nswollen to the amount of 54,000_l._, carrying a yearly interest of\r\n2360_l._, besides annuities granted to the amount of 1125_l._ a year.\r\n\r\n“The _Poplar and Greenwich_ accounts (I quote the official Report),\r\nconfined as they are to mere cash books, offer no subjects for\r\nremark....\r\n\r\n“No books of account have been produced with respect to the _St.\r\nKatherine’s_ Commission.”\r\n\r\nOn the 16th December, 1847, the new Commissioners ordered all the books\r\nto be sent to the office in Greek-street; but it was not until the 21st\r\nFebruary, 1848, that all the minute-books were produced. There were no\r\nindexes for many years even to the proceedings of the Courts; and the\r\naccount-books of one of the local Courts, if they might be so called,\r\nwere in such a state that the book called “ledger” had for several\r\nyears been cast up in pencil only.\r\n\r\nThis refers to what may be characterised, with more or less propriety,\r\nas _mismanagement_ or _neglect_; though in such mismanagement it is\r\nhardly possible to escape _one_ inference. I now come to what are\r\ndirect imputations of _Jobbery_, and where _that_ is flourishing or\r\neasy, no system can be other than vicious.\r\n\r\nIn a paper “printed for use of Commissioners” (Sept. 7, 1848),\r\nentitled “Draft Report on the Surrey Accounts,” emanating from a\r\n“General Purposes’ Committee,” I find the following, concerning\r\nthe parliamentary expenses of obtaining an Act which it was “found\r\nnecessary to repeal.” The cost was, altogether, upwards of 1800_l._,\r\nwhich of course had to be defrayed out of the taxes.\r\n\r\n“This Act,” says the Report, “authorized an almost unlimited borrowing\r\nof money; and _immediately upon its passing_, in July, 1847, notices\r\nwere issued for works estimated to amount to 100,000_l._; and others,\r\nwe understand, were projected for early execution to the amount of\r\n300,000_l._... Considering the general character of the works executed,\r\nand from them judging of those projected, it may confidently be averred\r\nthat the _whole sum_ of 300,000_l._, the progressive expenditure of\r\nwhich was stayed by the ‘supersedeas’ of the old Commission, would\r\nhave been _expended in waste_.” [The _Italics_ are not those of the\r\nReports.]\r\n\r\nThe Report continues, “It is to be observed that each of the district\r\nsurveyors would have participated in the sum of 15,000_l._ percentage\r\non the expenditure for the extension of the Surrey works. Thus the\r\nsurveyors, with their percentages on the works executed, and the clerk,\r\nby the fees on contracts, &c., had _a direct interest in a large\r\nexpenditure_.”\r\n\r\nInstances of the same dishonest kind might be multiplied to almost any\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nAfter the above evidences of the incompetency and dishonesty of\r\nthe several district Commissions--and the Reports from which they\r\nare copied contain many more examples of a similar and even worse\r\ndescription--it is not to be wondered at that in the year 1847 the\r\ndistrict courts were, with the exception of the City, superseded by\r\nthe authority of the Crown, and formed into one body, the present\r\nMetropolitan Commission of Sewers, of the constitution and powers of\r\nwhich I shall now proceed to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF THE PRESENT COMMISSIONS OF SEWERS.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 the eight separate Commissions of Sewers were abolished, and\r\nthe whole condensed, by the Government, into _one_ Commission, with\r\nthe exception of the City, which seems to supply an exception in most\r\npublic matters.\r\n\r\nThe Act does not fix the number of the Commissioners. To the\r\nMetropolitan Commissioners, five City Commissioners are added (the Lord\r\nMayor for the year being one _ex officio_); these have a right to act\r\nas members of the Metropolitan Board, but their powers in this capacity\r\nare loosely defined by the Act, and they rarely attend, or perhaps\r\nnever attend, unless the business in some way or other affects their\r\ndistinct jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners (of whom twelve form a quorum) are unpaid, with the\r\nexception of the chairman, Mr. E. Lawes, a barrister, who has 1000_l._\r\na year. They are appointed for the term of two years, revocable at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the City Commission, as distinct from the\r\nMetropolitan, for there are two separate Acts, seems to be more\r\nstrongly defined than that of the others, but the principle is the same\r\nthroughout. The Metropolitan Act bears date September 4, 1848; and the\r\nCity Act, September 5, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Commissioners have the control over “the sewers,\r\ndrains, watercourses, weirs, dams, banks, defences, gratings, pipes,\r\nconduits, culverts, sinks, vaults, cesspools, rivers, reservoirs,\r\nengines, sluices, penstocks, and other works and apparatus for the\r\ncollection and discharge of rain-water, surplus land or spring-water,\r\nwaste water, or filth, or fluid, or semi-fluid refuse of all\r\ndescriptions, and for the protection of land from floods or inundation\r\nwithin the limits of the Commission.” Ample as these powers seem to be,\r\nthe Commissioners’ authority does not extend over the Thames, which is\r\nin the jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor and Corporation of the City of\r\nLondon; and it appears childish to give men control over “rivers,”\r\nand to empower them to take measures “for the protection of land from\r\nfloods or inundation,” while over the great metropolitan stream itself,\r\nfrom Yantlet Creek, below Gravesend, to Oxford, they have no power\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners (City as well as Metropolitan) are empowered to\r\nenforce proper house-drainage wherever needed; to regulate the\r\nbuilding of new houses, in respect of water-closets, cesspools, &c.;\r\nto order any street, staircase, or passage not effectually cleansed\r\nto be effectually cleansed; to remedy all nuisances having insanitary\r\ntendencies; to erect _public_ water-closets and urinals, free from any\r\ncharge to the public; to order houses and rooms to be whitewashed; to\r\nerect places for depositing the bodies of poor persons deceased until\r\ninterment; and to regulate the cleanliness, ventilation, and even\r\naccommodation of low lodging-houses.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers extends\r\nover “all such places or parts in the counties of Middlesex, Surrey,\r\nEssex, and Kent, or any of them _not more than twelve miles distant in\r\na straight line from St. Paul’s Cathedral, in the City of London_, but\r\nnot being within the City of London or the liberties thereof.”\r\n\r\nThis, it must be confessed, is an exceedingly broad definition of the\r\nextent of the jurisdiction of the _Metropolitan_ Commission, giving the\r\nCommissioners an extraordinary amount of _latitude_.\r\n\r\nIn our days there are many Londons. There is the London (or the\r\nmetropolitan apportionment of the capital) as defined by the\r\nRegistrar-General. This, as we have seen, has an area of 115 square\r\nmiles, and therefore may be said to comprise as nearly as possible all\r\nthose places which are rather more than _five miles_ distant from the\r\nPost Office.\r\n\r\nThere is the _Metropolis_ as defined by the Post-Office functionaries,\r\nor the limits assigned to what is termed the “_London_ District Post.”\r\nThis London District Post seems, however, to have three different\r\nmetropolises:--First, there is the Central Metropolis, throughout\r\nwhich there is an hourly delivery of letters after mid-day, and which\r\ndeliveries are said to be confined to “_London._” Then there is the\r\nsix-delivery _Metropolis_, or that throughout which the letters are\r\ndespatched and received six times per day; this is said to extend to\r\nsuch of the “environs” as are included within a circle of _three miles_\r\nfrom the General Post Office. Then there is the _six-mile Metropolis_\r\nwith special privileges. And lastly, the _twelve-mile Metropolis_,\r\nwhich, being the extreme range of the _London_ District Post, may be\r\nsaid to constitute the metropolis of the General Post Office.\r\n\r\nThere is, again, the metropolis of the Metropolitan Commissioners\r\nof Police, before the region of rural police and country and parish\r\nconstables is attained; a jurisdiction which covers 96 square\r\nmiles, as I have shown at pp. 163-166 of the present volume, and\r\nreaches--generally speaking--to such places as are included within a\r\ncircle of _five miles and a half_ from the General Post Office.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, the metropolis, as defined by the Hackney-Carriage\r\nAct, which comprises all such places as are within _five miles_ of the\r\nGeneral Post Office.\r\n\r\nAnd further, there is the Metropolis of the London City Mission, which\r\nextends to _eight miles_ from the Post Office, and the Metropolis,\r\nagain, of the London Ragged Schools, which reaches to about _three\r\nmiles_ from the Post Office.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not all, for there are divers districts for the\r\nregistration and exercise of votes, parliamentary, or municipal; there\r\nare ecclesiastical and educational districts; there is a thorough\r\ncomplication of parochial, extra-parochial, and chartered districts;\r\nthere is a world of subdivisions and of sub-subdivisions, so ramified\r\nhere and so closely blended there, and often with such preposterous and\r\narbitrary distinctions, that to describe them would occupy more than a\r\nwhole Number.\r\n\r\nMy present business, however, is the extent of the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, or rather to ascertain\r\nthe boundaries of that _metropolis_ over which the Metropolitan\r\nCommissioners are allowed to have sway.\r\n\r\nThe many discrepancies and differences I have explained make it\r\ndifficult to _define_ any district for the London sewerage; and in\r\nthe Reports, &c., which are presented to Parliament, or prepared by\r\npublic bodies, little or no care seems to be taken to observe any\r\ndistinctiveness in this respect.\r\n\r\nFor instance: The jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Commission of\r\nSewers, which is said to extend to all such places as are not more than\r\n12 miles distant in a straight line from St. Paul’s Cathedral, in the\r\nCity of London, comprises an area of 452 square miles; the metropolis,\r\nthat of the Registrar-General, presenting a radius of 6 miles (with\r\na fractional addition), contains 115 square miles; yet in official\r\ndocuments 58 square miles, or a circle of about 4-1/2 miles radius, are\r\ngiven as the extent of the _metropolis_ sewered by the Metropolitan\r\nCommission. By what calculations this 58 miles are arrived at, whether\r\nit has been the _arbitrium_ of the authorities to consider the sewers,\r\n&c., as occupying _the half_ of the area of the Registrar-General’s\r\nmetropolis, or what other reason has induced the computation, I am\r\nunable to say.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the several metropolises may be indicated as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nThe _Three-Mile Circle_ includes Camberwell; skirts Peckham; seems to\r\ndivide Deptford (irregularly); touches the West India Dock; includes\r\nportions of Limehouse, Stepney, Bromley, Stratford-le-Bow, and about\r\nthe half of Victoria-park, Hackney. It likewise comprises a part of\r\nLower Clapton, Dalston, and a portion of Stoke Newington; and closely\r\ntouching upon or containing small portions of Lower Holloway, and\r\nKentish-town, sweeps through the Regent’s and Hyde parks, includes a\r\nmoiety of Chelsea, and crossing the river at the Red-house, Battersea,\r\ncompletes the circle. This is the six-delivery district of the General\r\nPost Office.\r\n\r\nIn this three-mile district are chiefly condensed the population,\r\ncommerce, and wealth of the greatest and richest city in the world.\r\n\r\nThe _Six-Mile Circle_ runs from Streatham (on the south); just excludes\r\nSydenham; contains within its exterior line Lewisham, Greenwich, and\r\na part of Woolwich; also, wholly or partially, East Ham, Laytonstone,\r\nWalthamstow, Tottenham, Hornsey, Highgate, Hampstead, Kensall-green,\r\nHammersmith, Fulham, Wandsworth, and Upper Tooting. The portion without\r\nthe three-mile circle, and within the six, is the _suburban_ portion\r\nor the immediate environs of the metropolis, and still presents rural\r\nand woodland beauties in different localities. This may be termed the\r\nmetropolis of the Registrar-General and Commissioners of Metropolitan\r\nPolice.\r\n\r\nThe _Twelve-Mile Circle_, or the extent of the jurisdiction of the\r\n_Metropolitan_ Commissioners of Sewers, as well as the “_London_\r\nDistrict Post,” includes Croydon, Wickham, Paul’s Cray, Foot’s\r\nCray, North Cray, and Bexley; crosses the river at the Erith-reach;\r\nproceeds across the Rainham-marshes; comprises Dagenham; skirts\r\nRomford; includes Henhault-forest and the greater portion of\r\nEpping-forest; touches Waltham-abbey and Cheshunt; comprehends Enfield\r\nand Chipping-Barnet; runs through Elstre and Stanmore; comprehends\r\nHarrow-on-the-Hill, Norwood, and Hounslow; embraces Twickenham and\r\nTeddington; seems to divide somewhat equally the domains of Bushey-park\r\nand of Hampton-court Palace; then, crossing the river about midway\r\nbetween Thames Ditton and Kingston, the boundary line passes between\r\nCheam and Ewell, and completes the circuit.\r\n\r\nOver this large district, then, the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan\r\nCommissioners of Sewers is said to extend, and one of the outlets of\r\nthe _London_ sewers has already been spoken of as being situate at\r\nHampton. The district yielding the amount of sewage which is assumed as\r\nbeing the gross wet house-refuse of the metropolis is, as we have seen,\r\ntaken at 58 square miles, and is comprised within a circle of about\r\n4-1/2 miles radius; this reaches only to Brixton, Dulwich, Greenwich,\r\nEast India Docks, Layton, Highgate, Hampstead, Bayswater, Kensington,\r\nBrompton, and Battersea. The actual jurisdiction of the Commissioners\r\nis, then, nearly eight times larger than the portion to which the\r\nestimated amount of the sewage of the metropolis refers.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan district is still distinguished by the old divisions\r\nof the Tower Hamlets, Poplar and Blackwall, Holborn and Finsbury,\r\nWestminster, &c.; but many of these divisions are now incorporated into\r\none district; of which there would appear to be but four at present; or\r\nfive, inclusive of the City.\r\n\r\nThese are as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Fulham and Hammersmith, Counter’s Creek and Ranelagh districts.\r\n\r\n2. Westminster (Eastern and Western), Regent-street, and Holborn.\r\n\r\n3. Finsbury, Tower Hamlets, Poplar, and Blackwall.\r\n\r\n4. Districts south of the Thames, Eastern and Western.\r\n\r\n5. City.\r\n\r\nThe practical part or working of the Commission of Sewers is much less\r\ncomplicated at present than it was in the times of the independent\r\ndistricts and independent commissions.\r\n\r\nThe orders for all work to be done emanate from the court in\r\nGreek-street, but the several surveyors, &c. (whose salaries, numbers,\r\n&c., are given below), can and do order on their responsibility any\r\nrepair of a temporary character which is evidently pressing, and\r\nreport it at the next court day. The Court meets weekly and monthly,\r\nand what may be styled the heavier portion of the business, as regards\r\nexpenditure on great works, is more usually transacted at the monthly\r\nmeetings, when the attendance is generally fuller; but the Court can,\r\nand sometimes does, meet much more frequently, and sometimes has\r\nadjourned from day to day.\r\n\r\nAny private individual or any public body may make a communication\r\nor suggestion to the Court of Sewers, which, if it be in accordance\r\nwith their functions, is taken into consideration at the next accruing\r\ncourt day, or as soon after as convenient. The Court in these cases\r\neither comes to a decision of adoption or rejection of any proposition,\r\nor refers it to one of their engineers or surveyors for a report, or\r\nto a committee of the Commissioners, appointed by the Court; if the\r\nproposition be professional, as to defects, or alleged and recommended\r\nimprovements in the local sewers, &c., it is referred to a professional\r\ngentleman for his opinion; if it be more general, as to the extension\r\nof sewerage to some new undertaking or meditated undertaking in the way\r\nof building new markets, streets, or any places, large and public; or\r\nin applications for the use and appropriation by enterprising men of\r\nsewage manure, it is referred to a committee.\r\n\r\nOn receiving such reports the Court makes an order according to its\r\ndiscretion. If the work to be done be extensive, it is entrusted to\r\nthe chief engineer, and perhaps to a principal surveyor acting in\r\naccordance with him; if the work be more local, it is consigned to\r\na surveyor. One or other of these officers provides, or causes to\r\nbe prepared, a plan and a description of the work to be done, and\r\ninstructs the clerk of the works to procure estimates of the cost at\r\nwhich a contractor will undertake to execute this work, or, as it is\r\noften called by the labouring class, to “complete the _job_” (a word\r\nat one time singularly applicable). The estimates are sent by the\r\ncompeting builders, architects, general speculators, or by any one\r\nwishing to contract, to the court house (without the intervention of\r\nany person, officially or otherwise) and they are submitted to the\r\nBoard by their clerk. The lowest contract, as the sum total of the\r\nwork, is most generally adopted, and when a contract has been accepted,\r\nthe matter seems settled and done with, as regards the management of\r\nthe Commissioners; for the contractor at once becomes responsible\r\nfor the fulfilment of his contract, and may and does employ whom he\r\npleases _and at what rates he pleases_, without fear of any control or\r\ninterference from the Court. The work, however, is superintended by the\r\nsurveyors, to ensure its execution according to the provisions of the\r\nagreement. The contractor is paid by direct order of the Court.\r\n\r\nThe surveyors and clerks of works are mostly limited as to their\r\nlabours to the several districts; but the superior officers are\r\nemployed in all parts, and so, if necessary, are the subordinate\r\nofficers when the work requires an extra staff.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Returns, the following functionaries appear to be\r\nconnected with the undermentioned districts:--\r\n\r\n  _Fulham, Hammersmith, Counter’s Creek, and Ranelagh._\r\n  1 Surveyor.\r\n  3 Clerks of the Works.\r\n  1 Inspector of Flushing.\r\n\r\n  _Eastern and Western Divisions of Westminster and Regent-street._\r\n  1 Surveyor, who has also the Holborn division to attend to.\r\n  2 Clerks of the Works.\r\n  6 Flap and Sluice keepers.\r\n\r\n  _Holborn._\r\n  2 Clerks of the Works.\r\n  1 Inspector of Flushing.\r\n\r\n  _Finsbury._\r\n  1 Clerk of the Works.\r\n  1 Inspector of Flushing.\r\n\r\n  _Tower Hamlets, and Poplar and Blackwall._\r\n  1 Surveyor, who has also the Finsbury division included in his district.\r\n  2 Clerks of the Works.\r\n  2 Inspectors of Flushing.\r\n\r\n  _South of the Thames.

The cracks in the basement still from month to month\r\n show a very slight movement; those in the staircase and roof also\r\n appear to increase. As respects this building, I would submit to the\r\n Commissioners of Woods that it _would not be advisable to permit\r\n the surveyors of the Commissioners of Sewers to enter and make only\r\n a surface repair of plaster and paint_; but I would suggest that a\r\n careful survey be made by surveyors appointed respectively by the\r\n Board of Woods and the Commissioners of Sewers, and that a thorough\r\n repair of the building be made (so far as it is susceptible of\r\n repair), under the Board of Woods; the Commissioners of Sewers paying\r\n such proportion of the cost thereof as may fairly be deemed to have\r\n been occasioned by their proceedings.\r\n\r\n “At the United Service Museum, the settlements on the side next the\r\n sewer appear to me very serious.\r\n\r\n “The house occupied by Lord Liverpool, as also Mr. Vertue’s house, of\r\n which his Lordship is Crown lessee, were both affected, the former to\r\n some extent, but not seriously; of the latter, the west front sunk,\r\n and pulled over the whole house with it; but as respects these two\r\n houses the interference of the Board is, I believe, unnecessary, Mr.\r\n Hardwicke (one of the Sewer Commissioners) having, as architect for\r\n Lord Liverpool, caused both to be repaired.\r\n\r\n “A like repair has also been made in the kitchen offices of Mr.\r\n Alderman Thompson’s house, where alone any cracks appeared.\r\n\r\n “At Messrs. Dalgleish and Taylor’s, very serious injury has been done\r\n to both their buildings and their trade. The Commissioners of Sewers\r\n have a steam-engine still at work on those premises, and have not yet\r\n concluded their operations there. Some of the sheds which entirely\r\n fell down they have rebuilt; and others, which appear in a very\r\n defective if not dangerous state, it is understood they propose to\r\n repair or rebuild; but as eventually Messrs. Dalgleish and Taylor will\r\n have a very heavy claim against them for interference with business,\r\n and as the extent of damage to the buildings which has been done, or\r\n may hereafter arise, cannot at present be fully ascertained, it would\r\n probably be advisable to postpone this part of the subject, giving\r\n notice, however, to the Commissioners of Sewers that it must hereafter\r\n come under consideration.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) “JAMES PENNETHORNE.\r\n\r\n  “10th May, 1851.”\r\n\r\n “_Sewer, Whitehall Yard, &c._\r\n\r\n “Under the order of the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Woods, &c.,\r\n of yesterday’s date, endorsed on a letter from Mr. Tonna, I have\r\n inspected the United Service Institution in Whitehall Yard, and find\r\n most of the cracks have moved.\r\n\r\n “The movement, though slight, and not showing immediate danger, is\r\n more than I had anticipated would occur within so short a period\r\n when I reported on the 10th instant.

This forms part of what are designated the\r\n_Local_ Taxes of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nLocal taxes are of two classes:--\r\n\r\nI. Rates raised upon property in _defined_ districts, as parishes,\r\njurisdictions, counties, &c.\r\n\r\nII. Tolls, dues, and fees charged for particular services on particular\r\noccasions, as turnpike tolls, harbour dues, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe rates or sums raised upon the property lying within a certain\r\ncircumscribed locality, admit of being subdivided into two orders--\r\n\r\n1. The rates of _independent_ districts, or those which, being required\r\nfor a particular district (as the parish or some equivalent territorial\r\nlimit), are not only levied within the bounds of that district, but\r\nexpended for the purposes of it alone; as is the case with the poor\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n2. The rates of _aggregate_ districts, or those which, though required\r\nto be expended for the purposes of a given district (such as the\r\ncounty), are raised in detail in the several inferior districts (such\r\nas the various parishes) which compose the larger one, and which\r\ncontribute the sums thus levied to one common fund; such is the case\r\nwith the county rate.\r\n\r\nBut the rates of independent districts may be further distinguished\r\ninto two orders, viz.--\r\n\r\ni. Those which are levied on the same classes of persons, the same\r\nkinds of property, and the same principles of valuation as the poor\r\nrate; such are the highway rate, the lighting and watching, and the\r\nmilitia rate among the independent rates; and the police, borough, and\r\ncounty rates among the aggregate rates.\r\n\r\nii. Those which are _not_ levied on the same basis as the poor rate.\r\nThe church and sewers rates are familiar instances of this peculiarity.\r\n\r\nThe sewers rate, then, is a local tax required for an _independent_\r\nrather than an _aggregate_ district, and is _not_ levied upon the basis\r\nof the poor law.\r\n\r\nThe assessment of the poor rate, for instance, includes tithes of every\r\nkind, that of the sewers rate extends to such tithes only as are in\r\nthe hands of laymen. Again, the sewers rate embraces some incorporeal\r\nhereditaments to which the poor rate does not extend; but stock in\r\ntrade, which of late years has been specially exempted from the poor\r\nrate, was never subject to the sewers rate.\r\n\r\nA sewers rate, however, was known as early as the sixth year of Henry\r\nVI. (1427), though “commissions” were not instituted till the time of\r\nHenry VIII. The Act which now regulates the collection of the funds\r\nrequired for the cleansing, building, repairs, and improvements of the\r\nsewers, is 4 and 5 Vict. (1841). This statute gives the “Courts” or\r\n“Commissions” of Sewers, power “to tax in the gross” in each parish,\r\n&c., all lands, &c., within the jurisdiction of such courts, for the\r\nrequirements of the public sewerage. This impost is not periodically\r\nlevied, nor at any stated or even regularly recurring term, but “as\r\noccasion requires:” perhaps once in two or three years. It is (with\r\nsome exceptions, which require no notice) what is commonly called “a\r\nlandlord’s tax” in the metropolis, that is, the sewers-rate collector\r\nmust be paid by the occupier of the premises, who, on the production of\r\nthe collector’s receipt, can deduct the amount from his rent. If this\r\narrangement were meant to convey a notion to the public that the sewers\r\ntax was a tax on property--on the capitalist who owns, and not on the\r\ntenant who merely occupies--it is a shallow device, for every one must\r\nknow that the more sewers rate a tenant pays _for_ his landlord, the\r\nmore rent he must pay _to_ him.\r\n\r\nThe sewers rate is levied according to the rateable value put upon\r\nproperty by the surveyors and assessors appointed by the Commissioners,\r\nwho may make the rate “by such ways and means, and in such manner and\r\nform, as to them may seem most convenient.” It seems a question yet to\r\nbe determined whether or not there is a right of appeal against the\r\nsewers rate, but the general opinion is that there is _no appeal_.\r\nThe rate can be mortgaged by the Commissioners if an advance of money\r\nis considered desirable. The maximum of 1_s._ in the pound on the net\r\nannual value of the property was fixed by the Act. The Commissioners\r\nhave also the power to levy a “special rate” on any district not\r\nconnected with the general system of sewerage, but which it has been\r\nresolved should be so connected; also an “improvement rate,” at a\r\nmaximum of 10 per cent. on the rack rent, “in respect of works they may\r\njudge to be of private benefit,” a provision which has called forth\r\nsome comments.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan sewers rate is now collected in nine districts.\r\n\r\nThere are at present 42 Commissions or Courts of Sewers throughout\r\nEngland and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe only return which has yet been prepared of the annual amount\r\nassessed and collected under the authority of the Metropolitan\r\nCommission of Sewers, is one presented to the House of Commons in 1843.\r\nIt includes the sum assessed in four of the eight districts within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Commissioners from 1831 to 1840\r\ninclusive.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+------------+------------\r\n                          |Total in the|   Annual\r\n      Districts.          | 10 years.  |  Average.\r\n  ------------------------+------------+------------\r\n                          |     £      |   £\r\n  Westminster             |  235,397   | 23,539-7/10\r\n  Holborn and Finsbury    |  123,317   | 12,331-7/10\r\n  Tower Hamlets           |   82,468   |  8,246-8/10\r\n  From East Moulsey,      |            |\r\n    in Surrey, to         |            |\r\n    Ravensbourne, in Kent |  175,137   | 17,513-7/10\r\n  ------------------------+------------+------------\r\n                          |  616,319   | 61,631-9/10\r\n  ------------------------+------------+------------\r\n\r\nThe following amounts were returned to Parliament as that expended in\r\ntwo other of the metropolitan districts in the year 1833:--\r\n\r\n    In the City                          £17,718-2/10\r\n    Poplar district                        2,746-9/10\r\n                                        ------------\r\n                                        £20,465-1/10\r\n\r\n    Annual average of the four above-mentioned\r\n  districts                              61,631-9/10\r\n  --------------------------------------------------\r\n                      Yearly total      £82,097\r\n\r\nThe two districts excluded from the above total are the minor ones of\r\nSt. Katherine and Greenwich, so that altogether the gross sum levied\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Commissioners must have\r\nbeen between 85,000_l._ and 90,000_l._\r\n\r\nThe annual amount of the local rates in England and Wales is, according\r\nto a work on the subject (“The Local Taxes of the United Kingdom”),\r\npublished “under the direction of the Poor Law Commissioners” in 1846,\r\n8,801,838_l._[68] In this large sum only the average annual outlay\r\non the six districts of the sewers of the metropolis is included\r\n(82,097_l._), and it is stated that not even an approximate average\r\ncould be arrived at as regards the expenditure on sewers in the country\r\ndistricts. Such absence of statistical knowledge,--and it is a want\r\ncontinually observable--is little creditable to the legislative,\r\nexecutive, and administrative powers of the State.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to show, from the best data at my command, the\r\npresent outlay on the metropolitan sewers.\r\n\r\nAccording to the present law, the Commissioners are required to submit\r\nto Parliament yearly returns of the money collected on account of, and\r\nexpended in, the sewerage of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nI need only state, that in the latest and, indeed, the sole returns\r\nupon the subject, the rates in 1845-6-7, under the former separate\r\ncommissions, were 1_d._ and 2_d._ in the pound on land, and from 3_d._\r\n(Ranelagh and Westminster) to 1_s._ 10_d._ (Greenwich) on houses.\r\n\r\nThe rates made under the combined and consolidated Commissions, from\r\n30th Nov., 1847, to 8th Oct., 1849, were all 6_d._, excepting the\r\nWestern division of Westminster sewers, which were 3_d._, and a part of\r\nthe Surrey and Kent district, 8_d._\r\n\r\nThe rates under the present Metropolitan Commission, from 8th October,\r\n1849, to 31st July, 1851, are all 6_d._, with a similar exception in\r\nSurrey and Kent. The following are the only further returns bearing\r\nimmediately on the subject:--\r\n\r\nRETURN OF THE PERCENTAGE ON THE TOTAL RATEABLE ANNUAL VALUE OF THE\r\nPROPERTY ASSESSED, to which the Rates collected under the separate\r\nCOMMISSIONS, between January, 1845, and November, 1847, amounted;\r\nSIMILAR RETURN as to the combined and consolidated COMMISSIONS, from\r\nNovember, 1847, to October, 1849; and as to the present COMMISSION,\r\nfrom October, 1849, to July 31, 1851.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------+----------------------------------+\r\n                                      |   Total Rateable    |                |\r\n                                      | Annual Value of the |                |          Amount of the\r\n                                      |    Districts on     | Average Amount |          Percentage of\r\n                                      |  November 30, 1847, |    collected   |       the Rates collected\r\n                                      | and October 8, 1849,| for One Year.  |         on the Rateable\r\n                                      |  and July 31, 1851, |                |          Annual Value.\r\n                                      |    respectively.    |                |\r\n  ------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------+----------------------------------+\r\n                                      |     £      _s._ _d._|    _£   s.  d._| _£  s. d._\r\n  Under the old separate Commissions }|                     |                |\r\n  of Sewers,  between                }| 6,683,896   0    0  |  81,738 11  0  |{ 1  4  5 or 2-3/4_d._ ·72 in the\r\n  January, 1845, and November        }|                     |                |{                pound per annum.\r\n  30, 1847                           }|                     |                |\r\n                                      |                     |                |\r\n  Under the combined and consolidated}|                     |                |\r\n  Commissions, from November         }|                     |                |{ 0 18 11-3/4 or 2-1/4_d._ ·11 in\r\n  30, 1847, to October 8,            }| 7,128,111   0    0  |  67,707 16  3  |{                   the pound per\r\n  1849 (including first Metropolitan }|                     |                |{                          annum.\r\n  Commission)                        }|                     |                |\r\n                                      |                     |                |\r\n  Under the present Metropolitan     }| 8,135,090[69] 0   0 |{               |{ 1  1 11 or 2-1/2_d._ ·52 in the\r\n  Commission of Sewers, from October }|                     |{ 89,341 16  0  |{                pound per annum.\r\n  8, 1849, to July 21, 1851          }| 8,820,325[70] 0   0 |{               |{ 1  0  3 or 2-1/4_d._ ·72 in the\r\n                                      |                     |                |{                pound per annum.\r\n  ------------------------------------+---------------------+----------------+----------------------------------+\r\n\r\n  AUGUST, 1851.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS COGGIN,\r\n      _Clerk of Rates and Collections._\r\n\r\nreturn of the present annual amount of the local rates in England and\r\nWales.\r\n\r\n  I.

S. HATTON,\r\n      _Accountant._\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CLEANSING OF THE SEWERS--VENTILATION.\r\n\r\nThere are two modes of purifying the sewers; the one consists in\r\nremoving the foul air, the other in removing the solid deposits. I\r\nshall deal first with that mode of purification which consists in the\r\nmechanical removal or chemical decomposition of the noxious gases\r\nengendered within the sewers.\r\n\r\nThis is what is termed the Ventilation of the Sewers, and forms a\r\nvery important branch of the inquiry into the character and working\r\nof the underground refuse-channels, for it relates to the risk of\r\nexplosions and the consequent risk of destruction to men’s lives;\r\nwhile, if the sewer be ill-ventilated, the surrounding atmosphere is\r\noften prejudicially affected by the escape of impure air from the\r\nsubterranean channels.\r\n\r\nA survey as to the ventilation, &c., of the sewers was made by Mr.\r\nHawkins, Assistant-Surveyor, and Mr. Jenkins, Clerk of the Works.\r\nFour examinations took place of sewers; of those in Bloomsbury;\r\nthose from Tottenham-court-road to Norfolk-street, Strand; from the\r\nGuard-room in Buckingham Palace to the Horseferry-road, Millbank; and\r\nin Grosvenor-square and the streets adjacent. There were difficulties\r\nattending the experiment. From Castle-street to Museum-street there was\r\na drop of 4 feet in the levels, so that the examiners had to advance on\r\ntheir hands and knees, and it was difficult to make observations. In\r\nsome places in Westminster also the water and silt were knee deep, and\r\nthe lamps (three were used) splashed all over. In Bloomsbury the sewers\r\ngave no token of the presence of any gas, but in the other places its\r\npresence was very perceptible, especially in a sewer on the west side\r\nof Grosvenor-square, a very low one, in which the gas was ignited\r\nwithin the wire shade of one of the lamps, but without producing any\r\neffect beyond that of immediately extinguishing the light. There was\r\nalso during the route, in the neighbourhood of Sir Henry Meux’s brewery\r\nand of an adjoining distillery in Vine-street, a considerable quantity\r\nof steam in the sewer, but it had no material effect upon the light.\r\n\r\nThe examiners came to the conclusion that where there was any\r\nliability to an explosion from the presence of carburetted hydrogen,\r\nor other causes, the Improved Davy Lamp afforded an almost certain\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Commissioners seems to have been chiefly given\r\nof late, as regards ventilation and indeed general improvement,\r\nto the sewers on the Surrey side of the metropolis. Among these a\r\nnew sewer along Friar-street, running from the Blackfriars to the\r\nSouthwark-bridge-road, is one of the most noticeable.\r\n\r\nFriar-street is one of the smaller off thoroughfares, the character\r\nof which is, perhaps, little suspected by those who pass along the\r\nopen Blackfriars-road. As you turn out of that road to the left hand,\r\nadvancing from the bridge, almost opposite the Magdalen Hospital, is\r\nFriar-street. On its left hand, as you proceed along it, are gas-works,\r\nand the factories, or work places, of tradesmen in the soap-boiling,\r\ntallow-melting, cat and other gut manufacturing, bone-boiling, and\r\nother noisome callings. On the right hand are a series of short and\r\noften neatly-built streets, but the majority of them have the look of\r\nunmistakable squalor or poverty, though _not_ of the poverty of the\r\nindustrious. Across Flint-street, Green-street, and other ways, few of\r\nthem horse thoroughfares, hang, on a fair day, lines of washed clothes\r\nto dry. Yellow-looking chemises and petticoats are affixed alongside\r\nmen’s trowsers and waistcoats; coarse-featured and brazen-looking\r\nwomen, with necks and faces reddened, as if with brick-dust, from\r\nexposure to the weather, stand at their doors and beckon to the passers\r\nby. Perhaps in no part of the metropolis is there a more marked\r\nmanifestation of moral obsceneness on the one hand, and physical\r\nobsceneness on the other. With the low prostitution of this locality\r\nis mixed the low and the bold crime of the metropolis. Some of the\r\noff-shoots from Friar-street communicate with places of as nefarious a\r\ncharacter. Hackett, whom his newspaper admirers seem to wish to elevate\r\ninto the fame of a second Jack Sheppard, resided in this quarter. The\r\ngang who were last winter repulsed in their burglarious attack on Mr.\r\nHolford’s villa in the Regent’s-park favoured the same locality, and\r\nwere arrested in their old haunts. Public-houses may be seen here and\r\nthere--houses, perhaps, not greatly discouraged by the police--which\r\nare at once the rendezvous and the trap of offenders, for to and from\r\nsuch resorts they can be readily traced. And all over this place of\r\nmoral degradation extends the stench of offensive manufactures and\r\nill-ventilated sewers. Certainly there is now an improvement, but it is\r\nstill bad enough.\r\n\r\nA Report of the 21st September, 1848, shows that a new sewer,\r\n1500 feet in length, had been “put in along Friar-street, with a\r\nfall of 15 inches from the level of the sewer in Blackfriars-road\r\nto Suffolk-street. The sewer,” states the Report, “with which it\r\ncommunicates at its upper end in the Blackfriars-road contains nearly\r\n2 feet in depth of soil; it in consequence has silted up to that\r\nlevel with semi-fluid black filth, principally from the factories, of\r\nthe most poisonous and sickening description, forming an _elongated\r\ncesspool_ 1500 feet in length, the filth at its lower end being upwards\r\nof 3 feet in depth. Since the building of this sewer, the foul matter\r\nso discharged into it has been in a state of decomposition, constantly\r\ngiving off pestilential and poisonous gases, which have spread into\r\nand filled the adjoining sewers; thence they are being drawn into the\r\nhouses by the house-drains, and into the streets by the street-drains,\r\nto such a fearful extent as to infect the whole atmosphere of the\r\nneighbourhood, and so to cause the very offensive odour so generally\r\ncomplained of there. Sulphuretted hydrogen is present in these sewers\r\nin large quantities, as metals, silver and copper, are attacked and\r\nblackened by it; and the smell from it is so sickening as to be almost\r\nunbearable.”\r\n\r\nOn the question of how best to deal with sewers such as the\r\nFriar-street, Messrs. John Roe and John Phillips (surveyors) and\r\nMr. Henry Austin (consulting engineer) have agreed in the following\r\nopinion:--\r\n\r\n“The most simple and convenient method would be by placing large strong\r\nfires in shafts directly over the crown of the sewers. The expense of\r\neach furnace, with the inclosure around it, will be about 20_l._ The\r\nfires would be fed almost constantly, by which little smoke would be\r\ngenerated. The heat to be produced from these fires would rarefy the\r\nair so much as to create rapidly ascending currents in the shafts, and\r\nstrong draughts through the sewers, the foul air in which would then be\r\ndrawn to the fires and there consumed; and as it was being destroyed\r\nfresh air would be drawn in at all the existing inlets of house and\r\nstreet drains, pushing forward and supplying the place of the foul air.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the explosions of, or deaths in, the sewers from the impure\r\ngases, there is, I believe, no statistical account. The most remarkable\r\ncatastrophe of this kind was the death of five persons in a sewer in\r\nPimlico, in October, 1849; of these, three were regular sewer-men, and\r\nthe others were a policeman and Mr. Wells, a surgeon, who went into the\r\nsewer in the hopes of giving assistance. Mr. Phillips, the then chief\r\nsurveyor of the Commission of Sewers, stated that the cause of these\r\ndeaths in the sewers was entirely an exceptional case, and the gas\r\nwhich had caused the accident inquired into was not a sewer gas. “There\r\nis often,” he said, “a great escape of gas from the mains, which found\r\nits way into the sewers. The gas, however, which has done the mischief\r\nin the present instance would not explode.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ure’s opinion was, that the deceased men died from asphixia, caused\r\nby inhaling sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid gas in mixture with\r\nprussic vapour, and that these noxious emanations were derived from the\r\nrefuse lime of gas-works thrown in with other rubbish to make up the\r\nroad above the sewer. Other scientific gentlemen attributed the five\r\ndeaths to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, or, according to Dr.\r\nLyon Playfair, to be chemically correct, hydro-sulphate of ammonia. The\r\ncoroner (Mr. Bedford), in summing up, said that Mr. Phillips wished it\r\nto be supposed that gas lime was the cause of the foul gas; and Dr.\r\nUre said that gas lime had to do with the calamity. But Dr. Miller,\r\nMr. Richard Phillips, Mr. Campbell, and Dr. Playfair, more especially\r\nthe latter, were perfectly sure that lime had nothing to do with it.\r\nThe verdict was the following:--“We find that Daniel Pert, Thomas Gee,\r\nand John Attwood died from the inhalation of noxious gas generated in\r\na neglected and unventilated sewer in Kenilworth-street. And we find\r\nthat Henry Wells and John Walsh met their deaths from the same cause,\r\nin their laudable endeavours to save the lives of the first three\r\nsufferers. The jury unanimously consider the commissioners and officers\r\nof the Metropolitan Sewers are much to blame for having neglected to\r\navail themselves of the unusual advantages offered, from the local\r\nsituation of the Grosvenor-canal, for the purpose of flushing the\r\nsewers in this district.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF “FLUSHING” AND “PLONGING,” AND OTHER MODES OF WASHING THE SEWERS.\r\n\r\nThe next step in our inquiry--and that which at present concerns us\r\nmore than any other--is the mode of removing the solid deposits from\r\nthe sewers, as well as the condition of the workmen connected with\r\nthat particular branch of labour. The sewers are the means by which\r\na larger proportion of the wet refuse of the metropolis is removed\r\nfrom our houses, and we have now to consider the means by which the\r\nmore solid part of this refuse is removed from the sewers themselves.\r\nThe latter operation is quite as essential to health and cleanliness\r\nas the former; for to allow the filth to collect in the channels\r\nwhich are intended to remove it, and there to remain decomposing and\r\nvitiating the atmosphere of the metropolis, is manifestly as bad as not\r\nto remove it at all; and since the more solid portions of the sewage\r\n_will_ collect and form hard deposits at the bottom of each duct, it\r\nbecomes necessary that some means should be devised for the periodical\r\npurgation of the sewers themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLUSHING THE SEWERS.\r\n\r\n(_Partly from a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD, _and partly from a Sketch\r\nkindly lent by_ MR. WHITING.)]\r\n\r\nThere have been two modes of effecting this object. The one has\r\nbeen the _carting_ away of the more solid refuse, and the other the\r\n_washing_ of it away, or, as it is termed, _flushing_ in the case of\r\nthe _covered_ sewers, and _plonging_ in the case of the _open_ ones.\r\nUnder both systems, whether the refuse be carted or flushed away,\r\nthe hard deposit has to be first loosened by manual labourers--the\r\ndifference consisting principally in the means of after-removal.\r\n\r\nThe first of these systems--viz., the cartage method--was that which\r\nprevailed in the metropolis till the year 1847. I shall therefore\r\ngive a brief description of this mode of cleansing the sewers before\r\nproceeding to treat of the now more general mode of “flushing.”\r\n\r\nUnder the old system, the clearing away of the deposit was a\r\n“nightman’s” work, differing little, except in being more toilsome,\r\noffensive to the public, and difficult. A hole was made from the street\r\ndown into the sewer where the deposit was thickest, and the deposit was\r\nraised by means of a tub, filled below, drawn up to the street, and\r\nemptied into a cart, or spread in mounds in the road to be shovelled\r\ninto some vehicle. A nightman told me that this mode of work was\r\nsometimes a great injury to his trade, because “when it was begun on a\r\nnight many of the householders sleeping in the neighbourhood used to\r\nsay to themselves, or to their missusses, as they turned in their beds,\r\n‘It’s them ere cussed cesspools again! I wish they was done away with.’\r\nAn’ all the time, sir, the cesspools was as hinnocent and as sweet as a\r\nhangel.”\r\n\r\nThis clumsy and filthy process is now but occasionally resorted to. A\r\nman who had superintended a labour of this kind in a narrow, but busy\r\nthoroughfare in Southwark, told me that these sewer labourers were the\r\nworst abused men in London. No one had a good word for them.\r\n\r\nBut there have been other modes of removing the indurated sewage,\r\nbesides that of cartage; and which, though not exactly flushing,\r\ncertainly consisted in allowing the deposit to be washed away. Some of\r\nthese contrivances were curious enough.\r\n\r\nI learn from a Report printed in 1849, that the King’s Scholars’ Pond\r\nSewer, in the city of Westminster, running near the Abbey, contained\r\na continuous bed of deposit, of soil, sand, and filth, from 10 to 30\r\ninches in depth, and this for a mile and a half next the river--the\r\nfirst mile yielding more than 6000 loads of matter. This sewer was to\r\nbe cleansed.\r\n\r\n“We first used a machine,” says Mr. J. Lysander Hale, “in the form of a\r\nplough and harrow combined; a horse dragged it through the deposit in\r\nthe sewer; one man attended the horse, and another guided the plough.\r\nThe work done by this machine, in cutting a channel through the soil\r\nand causing the water to move through it quickly, was effectual to\r\nremove the deposit; but as the sewer is a tidal sewer, and its sole\r\nentrance for a horse being its outlet, the machine could only be used\r\nfor a small part of any day. Sometimes with a strong breeze up the\r\nriver, the tide would not recede sufficiently to permit the horse to\r\nget in at all (and it did not appear advisable to incur the expense of\r\n50_l._ to build a sideway entrance for the animal), so that under these\r\ncircumstances we were obliged to discontinue the use of the horse\r\nand plough; which, under other circumstances, would have been very\r\neffective.” From this time, I understand, the sewers of London have\r\nremained unploughed by means of horse labour.\r\n\r\nBut the plough was not altogether abandoned, and as horse-power was\r\nnot found very easily applicable, water-power was resorted to. The\r\nplough and harrow were attached to a barge, which was introduced into\r\nthe sewer. The sluice gates were kept shut until the ebb of the tide\r\nmade the difference of level between the contents of the sewer and the\r\nsurface of the Thames equal to some eight feet. “The gates were then\r\nsuddenly opened, and the rapid and deep current of water following, was\r\nthen sufficient to bring the barge and plough down the sewer with a\r\nforce equal to five or six horse-power.”\r\n\r\nThis last-mentioned method was also soon abandoned. We now come to the\r\nmore approved plan of “flushing.”\r\n\r\n“The term ‘_flushing_ sewers’ implies,” says Mr. Haywood, in his\r\nReport, “cleansing by the application of _bodies_ of water in the\r\nsewers; this is periodically effected, varying in intervals according\r\nto the necessities of the sewerage or other circumstances.”\r\n\r\nThe flushing system has a two-fold object, viz., to remove old deposits\r\nand prevent the accumulation of new. When the deposit is not allowed to\r\naccumulate and harden, “flushing consists,” says Mr. Haywood, “simply\r\nin heading back and letting off _flush at once_” (hence the origin of\r\nthe term) “that which has been delivered into the sewers in a certain\r\nnumber of hours by the various houses draining into them, diluted with\r\nlarge quantities of water specially employed for the purpose.”\r\n\r\nThough the operation of “flushing” is one of modern introduction,\r\nas regards the metropolis--one, indeed, which may be said to have\r\noriginated in the modern demand for improved sanitary regulations--it\r\nhas been practised in some country parts since the days of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nFlushing was practised also by those able engineers, the ancient\r\nRomans. One of the grand architectural remains of that people, the best\r\nshowing their system of flushing, is in the Amphitheatre at Nismes, in\r\nFrance. The site of the ruined amphitheatre presents a large elliptical\r\narea, 114,251 superficial feet comprising its extent. Around the arena\r\nran a large sewer 3 feet 6 inches in width, and 4 feet 9 inches in\r\nheight. With this sewer, elliptical in shape, 348 pipes communicated,\r\ncarrying into it the rain-fall and the refuse caused by the resort of\r\n23,000 persons, for the seats alone contained that number. “The system\r\nof flushing, practised here,” says Mr. Cresy, “with such advantage,\r\ndeserves to be noticed, there being means of driving through this\r\nelliptical sewer a volume of water at pleasure, with such force that no\r\nsolid matter could by any possibility remain within any of the drains\r\nor sewers. An aqueduct, 2 feet 8 inches in width, and 6 feet in height,\r\nbrought this water from the reservoirs of Nismes, not only to fill but\r\nto purge the whole of these sewers; after traversing the arena, it\r\ndeviated a little to the south-west, where it was carried out at the\r\nsixth arcade, east of the southern entrance. Man-holes and steps to\r\ndescend into this capacious vaulted aqueduct were introduced in several\r\nplaces; and there can be no doubt that by directing for some hours such\r\na stream of water through it, the greatest cleanliness was preserved\r\nthroughout all the sewers of the building.”\r\n\r\nThe flushing of sewers appears to have been introduced into the\r\nmetropolis by Mr. John Roe in the year 1847, but did not come into\r\ngeneral use till some years later. There used to be a partial flushing\r\nof the London sewers twelve years ago. The mode of flushing as at\r\npresent practised is as follows:--\r\n\r\nIn the first instance the inspector examines and reports the condition\r\nof the sewer, and receives and issues his orders accordingly. When\r\nthe sewer is ordered to be flushed--and there is no periodical or\r\nregular observance of time in the operation--the men enter the sewers\r\nand rake up the deposit, loosening it everywhere, so as to render the\r\nwhole easy to be swept along by the power of the volume of water. The\r\nsewers generally are, in their widest part, provided with grooves, or,\r\nas the men style them, “framings.” Into these framings are fitted, or\r\npermanently attached, what I heard described as “penstocks,” but which\r\nare spoken of in some of the reports as “traps,” “gates,” or “sluice\r\ngates.” They are made both of wood and iron. By a series of bolts and\r\nadjustments, the penstocks can be fixed ready for use when the tide is\r\nhighest in the sewer, and the volume of water the greatest. They then,\r\nof course, are in the nature of dams, the water having accumulated\r\nin consequence of the stoppage. The deposit having been loosened,\r\nthe bolts are withdrawn, when the gates suddenly fly back, and the\r\naccumulated water and stirred-up sewage sweeps along impetuously, while\r\nthe men retreat into some side recesses adapted for the purpose. The\r\nsame is done with each penstock until the matter is swept through the\r\noutlet. The men always follow the course of this sewage-current when\r\nthe sewer is of sufficient capacity to enable them to do so, throwing\r\nor pushing forward any more solid matter with their shovels.\r\n\r\n“To flush we generally go and draw a slide up and let a flush of water\r\ndown,” said one man to me, “and then we have iron rakers to loosen the\r\nstuff. We have got another way that we do it as well; one man stands\r\nhere, when the flush of water’s coming down, with a large board; then\r\nhe lets the water rise to the top of this board, and then there’s\r\ntwo or three of us on ahead, with shovels, loosening the stuff--then\r\nhe ups with this board and lets a good heavy flush of water come\r\ndown. Precious hard work it is, I can assure you. I’ve had many a wet\r\nshirt. We stand up to our fork in the water, right to the top of our\r\njack-boots, and sometimes over them.” “Ah, I should think you often\r\nget over the top of yours, for you come home with your stockings\r\nwet enough, goodness knows,” exclaimed his wife, who was present.\r\n“When there’s a good flush of water coming down,” he resumed, “we’re\r\nobligated to put our heads fast up against the crown of the sewer, and\r\nbear upon our shovels, so that we may not be carried away, and taken\r\nbang into the Thames. You see there’s nothing for us to lay hold on.\r\nWhy, there was one chap went and lifted a slide right up, when he ought\r\nto have had it up only 9 or 10 inches at the furthest, and he nearly\r\nswamped three of us. If we should be taken off our legs there’s a heavy\r\nfall--about 3 feet--just before you comes to the mouth of the sewer,\r\nand if we was to get there, the water is so rapid nothing could save\r\nus. When we goes to work we nails our lanterns up to the crown of the\r\nsewer. When the slide is lifted up the rush is very great, and takes\r\nall before it. It roars away like a wild beast. We’re always obliged\r\nto work according to tide, both above and below ground. When we have\r\ngot no water in the sewer we shovels the dirt up into a bank on both\r\nsides, so that when the flush of water comes down the loosened dirt is\r\nall carried away by it. After flushing, the bottom of the sewer is as\r\nclean as this floor, but in a couple of months the soil is a foot to 15\r\ninches deep, and middling hard.”\r\n\r\n“Flushing-gates,” an engineer has reported, “are chiefly of use in\r\nsewers badly constructed and without falls, but containing plenty of\r\nwater; and they are of very little use where the gate has to be shut\r\n24 hours and longer, before a head of water has accumulated; but where\r\nintermittent flushing is practised, strong smells are often caused\r\n_solely_ by the stagnation of the water or sewage while accumulating\r\nbehind the gate.”\r\n\r\nThe most general mode of flushing at present adopted is not to keep in\r\nthe water, &c., which has flowed into the sewer from the streets and\r\nhouses, as well as the tide of the river, but to convey the flushing\r\nwater from the plugs of the water companies into the kennels, and so\r\ninto the sewers. I find in one of the Reports acknowledgments of the\r\nliberal supplies granted for flushing by the several companies. The\r\nwater of the Surrey Canal has been placed, for the same object, at the\r\ndisposal of the Sewer Commissioners.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to “flush” at all where a sewer has a “dead-end;” that\r\nis, where there is a “block,” as in the case of the Kenilworth-street\r\nsewer, Pimlico, in which five persons lost their lives in 1848.\r\n\r\nThere is no difference in the system of flushing in the Metropolitan\r\nand City jurisdictions, except that for the greater facilities of\r\nthe process, the City provides water-tanks in Newgate-market, where\r\nthe heads of three sewers meet, and where the accumulation of animal\r\ngarbage, and the fierceness and numbers of the rats attracted thereby,\r\nwere at one time frightful; at Leadenhall-market, and elsewhere, such\r\ntanks were also provided to the number of ten, the largest being\r\nthe Newgate-market tank, which is a brick cistern of 8000 gallons\r\ncapacity. Of these tanks, however, only four are now kept filled, for\r\nthis collection of water is found unnecessary, the regular system of\r\nflushing answering the purpose without them; and I understand that in\r\na little time there will be no tanks at all. The tank is filled, when\r\nrequired, by a water company, and the penstocks being opened, the water\r\nrushes into the sewers with great force. There is also another point\r\npeculiar to the City--in it all the sewers are flushed regularly twice\r\na week; in the metropolitan sewers, only when the inspector pronounces\r\nflushing to be required. The City plan appears the best to prevent the\r\naccumulation of deposit.\r\n\r\nThere still remains to be described the system of “_plonging_,” or mode\r\nof cleansing the open sewers, as contradistinguished from “_flushing_,”\r\nor the cleansing of the covered sewers.\r\n\r\n“When we go plonging,” one man said, “we has long poles with a piece\r\nof wood at the end of them, and we stirs up the mud at the bottom of\r\nthe ditches while the tide’s a going down. We has got slides at the end\r\nof the ditches, and we pulls these up and lets out the water, mud, and\r\nall, into the Thames.” “Yes, for the people to drink,” said a companion\r\ndrily. “We’re in the water a great deal,” continued the man. “We can’t\r\nwalk along the sides of all of ’em.”\r\n\r\nThe difference of cost between the old method of removal and the new,\r\nthat is to say, between carting and flushing, is very extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThis cartage work was done chiefly by contract and according to a\r\nReport of the surveyors to the Commissioners (Aug. 31, 1848), the usual\r\ncost for such work (almost always done during the night) was 7_s._ the\r\ncubic yard; that is, 7_s._ for the removal of a cubic yard of sewage\r\nby manual labour and horse and cart. In February, 1849 (the date of\r\nanother Report on the subject), the cost of removing a cubic yard by\r\nthe operation of flushing, was but 8_d._ This gives the following\r\nresult, but in what particular time, instance, or locality, is not\r\nmentioned:--\r\n\r\n  79,483 cubic yards of deposit removed\r\n  by the contract flushing system, at 8_d._\r\n  per cubic yard                             £2,649\r\n\r\n  Same quantity by the old system of\r\n  casting and cartage, 7_s._ per cubic yard  27,819\r\n                                            -------\r\n  Difference                                £25,170\r\n                                            -------\r\n\r\n“It appears, therefore,” says Mr. Lovick, “that by the adoption of\r\nthe contract flushing system, a saving has been effected within the\r\ncomparatively short period of its operation over the filthy and clumsy\r\nsystem formerly practised, of 25,170_l._, showing the cost of this\r\nsystem to be ten and a half times greater than the cost of flushing by\r\ncontract.”\r\n\r\nAn official Report states: “When the accumulations of years had to\r\nbe removed from the sewers, the rate of cost per lineal mile has\r\nvaried from about 40_l._ to 58_l._, or from 6_d._ to 8_d._ per lineal\r\nyard. The works in these cases (excepting those in the City) have not\r\nexceeded nine lineal miles.”\r\n\r\n“On an average of weeks,” says Mr. Lovick, in his Report on flushing\r\noperations, a few months after the introduction of the contract\r\nsystem, in Sept., 1848, “under present arrangements, about 62 miles\r\nof sewers are passed through each week, and deposit prevented from\r\naccumulating in them by periodic (weekly) flushing. The average cost\r\nper lineal mile per week is about 2_l._ 10_s._\r\n\r\n“The nature of the agreements with the contractors or gangers are now\r\nfor the prevention of accumulations of deposit in a district. For this\r\npurpose the large districts are subdivided, each subdivision being let\r\nto one man. In the Westminster district there are four, in the Holborn\r\nand Finsbury two, in the Surrey and Kent, seven subdivisions.\r\n\r\n“The Tower Hamlets and Poplar districts are each let to one man.\r\n\r\n“In the Tower Hamlets it will be perceived that a reduction of 8_l._\r\nhas been effected for the performance of precisely the same work as\r\nthat heretofore performed; the rates of charge standing thus:--\r\n\r\n  “Under the day-work system 23_l._ per week.\r\n       „     contract   „    15_l._    „\r\n\r\n“In those portions specially contracted for, the work has been let by\r\nthe lineal measure of the sewer, in preference to the amount of deposit\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n“In the Surrey and Kent districts the open ditches have been cleansed\r\nthrice as often as formerly.\r\n\r\n“A large proportion of the deposit removed is from the open ditches;\r\nin these the accumulations are rapid and continuous, caused chiefly by\r\ntheir being the receptacles for the ashes and refuse of the houses, the\r\nrefuse of manufactories, and the sweepings of the roads.\r\n\r\n“In the covered sewers one of the chief sources of accumulation is the\r\ndetritus and mud from the streets, swept into the sewers.\r\n\r\n“The accumulations from these sources will not, I think, be\r\nover-estimated at two-thirds of the whole amount of deposit removed.\r\n\r\n“The contracts in operation, February, 1849, with the districts which\r\nthey embrace, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“TABLE NO.

But by what means was this brought about? It is the old\r\nstory, I regret to say--a reduction of the wages of the labouring men.\r\nBut this, indeed, is the invariable effect of the contract system. The\r\nwages of the flushermen previous to Sept., 1848, were 24_s._ to 27_s._\r\na week; under the present system they are 21_s._ to 22_s._ Here is a\r\nreduction of 4_s._ per week per man, at the least; and as there were\r\nabout 150 hands employed at this period, it follows that the gross\r\nweekly saving must have been equal to 30_l._, so that, according to\r\nthe above account, there would have been about 5_l._ left for the\r\ncontractors or middlemen. It is unworthy of _gentlemen_ to make a\r\nparade of economy obtained by such ignoble means.\r\n\r\nThe engineers, however, speak of flushing as what is popularly\r\nunderstood as but “a make-shift”--as a system imperfect in itself,\r\nbut advantageously resorted to because obviating the evils of a worse\r\nsystem still.\r\n\r\n“With respect to these operations,” says Mr. Lovick, in a Report on\r\nthe subject, in February, 1849, “I may be permitted to state that,\r\nalthough I do not approve of the flushing as an ultimate system, or as\r\na system to be adopted in the future permanent works of sewerage, or\r\nthat its use should be contemplated with regulated sizes of sewers,\r\nregulated supplies of water, and proper falls, it appears to be the\r\nmost efficacious and economical for the purpose to which it is adapted\r\nof any yet introduced.”\r\n\r\nA gentleman who was at one time connected professionally with the\r\nmanagement of the public sewerage, said to me,--\r\n\r\n“Mr. John Roe commenced the general system of flushing sewers in London\r\nin 1847. It is, however, but a clumsy expedient, and quite incompatible\r\nwith a perfect system of sewerage. It has, nevertheless, been usefully\r\napplied as an auxiliary to the existing system, though the cost is\r\nfrightful.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE WORKING FLUSHERMEN.\r\n\r\nWhen the system of sewer cleansing first became general, as I have\r\ndetailed, the number of flushermen employed, I am assured, on good\r\nauthority, was about 500. The sewers were, when this process was first\r\nresorted to, full of deposit, often what might be called “coagulated”\r\ndeposit, which could not be affected except by constantly repeated\r\nefforts. There are now only about 100 flushermen, for the more\r\nregularly flushing is repeated, the easier becomes the operation.\r\n\r\nUntil about 18 months ago, the flushermen were employed directly by the\r\nCourt of Sewers, and were paid (“in Mr. Roe’s time,” one man said,\r\nwith a sigh) from 24_s._ to 27_s._ a week; now the work is _all done\r\nby contract_. There are some six or seven contractors, all builders,\r\nwho undertake or are responsible for the whole work of flushing in the\r\nmetropolitan districts (I do not speak of the City), and they pay the\r\nworking flushermen 21_s._ a week, and the gangers 22_s._ This wage is\r\nalways paid in money, without drawbacks, and without the intervention\r\nof any other middleman than the contractor middleman. The flushermen\r\nhave no perquisites except what they may chance to find in a sewer.\r\nTheir time of labour is 6-1/2 hours daily.\r\n\r\nThe state of the tide, however, sometimes, as a matter of course,\r\ncompels the flushermen to work at every hour of the day and night. At\r\nall times they carry lights, common oil lamps, with cotton wicks; only\r\nthe inspectors carry Davy’s safety-lamp. I met no man who could assign\r\nany reason for this distinction, except that “the Davy” gave “such a\r\nbad light.”\r\n\r\nThe flushermen wear, when at work, strong blue overcoats, waterproofed\r\n(but not so much as used to be the case, the men then complaining of\r\nthe perspiration induced by them), buttoned close over the chest, and\r\ndescending almost to the knees, where it is met by huge leather boots,\r\ncovering a part of the thigh, such as are worn by the fishermen on\r\nmany of our coasts. Their hats are fan-tailed, like the dustmen’s. The\r\nflushermen are well-conducted men generally, and, for the most part,\r\nfine stalwart good-looking specimens of the English labourer; were they\r\nnot known or believed to be temperate, they would not be employed.\r\nThey have, as a body, no benefit or sick clubs, but a third of them, I\r\nwas told, or perhaps nearly a third, were members of general benefit\r\nsocieties. I found several intelligent men among them. They are engaged\r\nby the contractors, upon whom they call to solicit work.\r\n\r\n“Since Mr. Roe’s time,” and Mr. Roe is evidently the popular man among\r\nthe flushermen, or somewhat less than four years ago, the flushermen\r\nhave had to provide their own dresses, and even their own shovels to\r\nstir up the deposit. To contractors, the comforts or health of the\r\nlabouring men must necessarily be a secondary consideration to the\r\nrealization of a profit. New men can always be found; safe investments\r\ncannot.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the flushermen therefore have been not only decreased, but\r\ntheir expenses increased. A pair of flushing-boots, covering a part of\r\nthe thigh, similar to those worn by sea-side fishermen, costs 30_s._ as\r\na low price, and a flusherman wears out three pairs in two years. Boot\r\nstockings cost 2_s._ 6_d._ The jacket worn by the men at their work in\r\nthe sewers, in the shape of a pilot-jacket, but fitting less loosely,\r\nis 7_s._ 6_d._; a blue smock, of coarse common cloth (generally), worn\r\nover the dress, costs 2_s._ 6_d._; a shovel is 2_s._ 6_d._ “Ay, sir,”\r\nsaid one man, who was greatly dissatisfied with this change, “they’ll\r\nmake soldiers find their own regimentals next; and, may be, their\r\nown guns, a’cause they can always get rucks of men for soldiers or\r\nlabourers. I know there’s plenty would work for less than we get, but\r\nwhat of that? There always is. There’s hundreds would do the work for\r\nhalf what the surveyors and inspectors gets; but it’s all right among\r\nthe nobs.”\r\n\r\nNor is the labour of the flushermen at all times so easy or of such\r\ncircumscribed hours as I have stated it to be in the regular way of\r\nflushing. When small branch-sewers have to be flushed, the deposit must\r\nfirst be loosened, or the water, instead of sweeping it away, would\r\nflow over it, and in many of these sewers (most frequent in the Tower\r\nHamlets) the height is not more than 3 feet. Some of the flushermen are\r\ntall, bulky, strong fellows, and cannot stand upright in less than from\r\n5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet, and in loosening the deposit in low narrow\r\nsewers, “we go to work,” said one of them, “on our bellies, like frogs,\r\nwith a rake between our legs. I’ve been blinded by steam in such sewers\r\nnear Whitechapel Church from the brewhouses; I couldn’t see for steam;\r\nit was a regular London fog. You must get out again into a main sewer\r\non your belly; that’s what makes it harder about the togs, they get\r\nworn so.”\r\n\r\nThe division of labour among the flushermen appears to be as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe _Inspector_, whose duty it is to go round the several sewers and\r\nsee which require to be flushed.\r\n\r\nThe _Ganger_, or head of the working gang, who receives his orders from\r\nthe inspector, and directs the men accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe _Lock-keeper_, or man who goes round to the sewers which are about\r\nto be flushed, and fixes the “penstocks” for retaining the water.\r\n\r\nThe _Gang_, which consists of from three to four men, who loosen the\r\ndeposit from the bottom of the sewer. Among these there is generally a\r\n“for’ard man,” whose duty it is to remove the penstocks.\r\n\r\nThe ganger gets 1_s._ a week over and above the wages of the men.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE

Flushermen.\r\n  Fulham and Hammersmith        employing  1   and    6    }\r\n  Counter’s Creek and Ranelagh                             }1st District of\r\n    Districts.                      „      1    „     7    }  Commissioners.\r\n\r\n  Westminster (Western Division)    „      1    „    10    }\r\n     Ditto    (Eastern Division)    „      1    „    12    }2nd District of\r\n  Holborn Division                  „      1    „     8    }  Commissioners.\r\n\r\n  Finsbury Division                 „      1    „     9    }\r\n  Tower Hamlets Levels              „      1    „    10    }3rd District of\r\n  Poplar and Blackwall              „      1    „     8    }  Commissioners.\r\n\r\n  Districts south of the Thames     „      2    „    22    4th District of\r\n                                                              Commissioners.\r\n\r\n  City                              „      1    „     9\r\n\r\nHolborn and Finsbury districts are under one contractor, and so are the\r\ntwo divisions of Westminster. The same men who flush Holborn flush the\r\nFinsbury district also, 17 being the average number employed; but the\r\nFinsbury district requires rather more men than the Holborn; and the\r\nsame men who work on the western division of Westminster flush also the\r\neastern, the number of flushers in the western district being more, on\r\naccount of its being the larger division.\r\n\r\nThe inspector receives 80_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nThe table on p. 429 shows the number of clerks of the works, inspectors\r\nof flushing, flap and sluice keepers, gangers, and flushermen employed\r\nin the several districts throughout the metropolis, as well as the\r\nsalaries and wages of each and the whole.\r\n\r\nNone of the flushermen can be said to have been “brought up to the\r\nbusiness,” for boys are never employed in the sewers. Neither had\r\nthe labourers been confined in their youth to any branch of trade in\r\nparticular, which would appear to be consonant to such employment.\r\nThere are now among the flushermen men who have been accustomed to\r\n“all sorts of ground work:” tailors, pot-boys, painters, one jeweller\r\n(some time ago there was also one gentleman), and shoemakers. “You see,\r\nsir,” said one informant, “many of such like mechanics can’t live above\r\nground, so they tries to get their bread underneath it. There used to\r\nbe a great many pensioners flushermen, which weren’t right,” said one\r\nman, “when so many honest working men haven’t a penny, and don’t know\r\nwhich way to turn theirselves; but pensioners have often good friends\r\nand good interest. I don’t hear any complaints that way now.”\r\n\r\nAmong the flushermen are some ten or twelve men who have been engaged\r\nin sewer-work of one kind or another between 20 and 30 years. The\r\ncholera, I heard from several quarters, did not (in 1848) attack any of\r\nthe flushermen. The answer to an inquiry on the subject generally was,\r\n“Not one that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“It is a somewhat singular circumstance,” says Mr. Haywood, the City\r\nSurveyor, in his Report, dated February, 1850, “_that none of the\r\nmen employed in the City sewers in flushing and cleansing, have been\r\nattacked with, or have died of, cholera during the past year; this\r\nwas also the case in 1832-3_. I do not state this to prove that the\r\natmosphere of the sewers is not unhealthy--I by no means believe an\r\nimpure atmosphere is healthy--but I state the naked fact, as it appears\r\nto me a somewhat singular circumstance, and leave it to pathologists to\r\nargue upon.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think flushing work disagrees with my husband,” said a\r\nflusherman’s wife to me, “for he eats about as much again at that work\r\nas he did at the other.” “The smell underground is sometimes very bad,”\r\nsaid the man, “but then we generally take a drop of rum first, and\r\nsomething to eat. It wouldn’t do to go into it on an empty stomach,\r\n’cause it would get into our inside. But in some sewers there’s\r\nscarcely any smell at all. _Most of the men are healthy who are engaged\r\nin it; and when the cholera was about many used to ask us how it was we\r\nescaped._”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following statement contains the history of an individual\r\nflusherman:--\r\n\r\n“I was brought up to the sea,” he said, “and served on board a\r\nman-of-war, the _Racer_, a 16-gun brig, laying off Cuba, in the West\r\nIndies, and there-away, watching the slavers. I served seven years.\r\nWe were paid off in ’43 at Portsmouth, and a friend got me into\r\nthe _shores_. It was a great change from the open sea to a close\r\n_shore_--great; and I didn’t like it at all at first. But it suits\r\na married man, as I am now, with a family, much better than being a\r\nseaman, for a man aboard a ship can hardly do his children justice in\r\ntheir schooling and such like. Well, I didn’t much admire going down\r\nthe man-hole at first--the ‘man-hole’ is a sort of iron trap-door that\r\nyou unlock and pull up; it leads to a lot of steps, and so you get into\r\nthe _shore_--but one soon gets accustomed to anything. I’ve been at\r\nflushing and _shore_ work now since ’43, all but eleven weeks, which\r\nwas before I got engaged.\r\n\r\n“We work in gangs from three to five men.” [Here I had an account of\r\nthe process of flushing, such as I have given.] “I’ve been carried\r\noff my feet sometimes in the flush of a _shore_. Why, to-day,” (a\r\nvery rainy and windy day, Feb. 4,) “it came down Baker-street, when\r\nwe flushed it, 4 foot plomb. It would have done for a mill-dam. One\r\ncouldn’t smoke or do anything. Oh, yes, we can have a pipe and a chat\r\nnow and then in the _shore_. The tobacco checks the smell. No, I can’t\r\nsay I felt the smell very bad when I first was in a _shore_. I’ve\r\nfelt it worse since. I’ve been made innocent drunk like in a _shore_\r\nby a drain from a distiller’s. That happened me first in Vine-street\r\n_shore_, St. Giles’s, from Mr. Rickett’s distillery. It came into\r\nthe _shore_ like steam. No, I can’t say it tasted like gin when you\r\nbreathed it--only intoxicating like. It was the same in Whitechapel\r\nfrom Smith’s distillery. One night I was forced to leave off there,\r\nthe steam had such an effect. I was falling on my back, when a mate\r\ncaught me. The breweries have something of the same effect, but nothing\r\nlike so strong as the distilleries. It comes into the _shore_ from the\r\nbrewers’ places in steam. I’ve known such a steam followed by bushels\r\nof grains; ay, sir, cart-loads washed into the _shore_.\r\n\r\n“Well, I never found anything in a _shore_ worth picking up but once\r\na half-crown. That was in the Buckingham Palace sewer. Another time I\r\nfound 16_s._ 6_d._, and thought that _was_ a haul; but every bit of it,\r\nevery coin, shillings and sixpences and joeys, was bad--all smashers.\r\nYes, of course it was a disappointment, naturally so. That happened\r\nin Brick-lane _shore_, Whitechapel. O, somebody or other had got\r\nfrightened, I suppose, and had shied the coins down into the drains. I\r\nfound them just by the chapel there.”\r\n\r\nA second man gave me the following account of his experience in\r\nflushing:--\r\n\r\n“You remember, sir, that great storm on the 1st August, 1848. I was\r\nin three _shores_ that fell in--Conduit-street and Foubert’s-passage,\r\nRegent-street. There was then a risk of being drowned in the _shores_,\r\nbut no lives were lost. All the house-drains were blocked about\r\nCarnaby-market--that’s the Foubert’s-passage _shore_--and the poor\r\npeople was what you might call houseless. We got in up to the neck in\r\nwater in some places, ’cause we had to stoop, and knocked about the\r\nrubbish as well as we could, to give a way to the water. The police put\r\nup barriers to prevent any carts or carriages going that way along the\r\nstreets. No, there was no lives lost in the _shores_. One man was so\r\novercome that he was falling off into a sort of sleep in Milford-lane\r\n_shore_, but was pulled out. I helped to pull him. He was as heavy as\r\nlead with one thing or other--wet, and all that. Another time, six or\r\nseven year ago, Whitechapel High-street _shore_ was almost choked with\r\nbutchers’ offal, and we had a great deal of trouble with it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE RATS IN THE SEWERS.\r\n\r\nI will now state what I have learned from long-experienced men, as\r\nto the characteristics of the rats in the sewers. To arrive even at\r\na conjecture as to the numbers of these creatures--now, as it were,\r\nthe population of the sewers--I found impossible, for no statistical\r\nobservations have been made on the subject; but all my informants\r\nagreed that the number of the animals had been greatly diminished\r\nwithin these four or five years.\r\n\r\nIn the better-constructed sewers there are no rats. In the old sewers\r\nthey abound. The sewer rat is the ordinary house or brown rat,\r\nexcepting at the outlets near the river, and here the water-rat is seen.\r\n\r\nThe sewer-rat is the common brown or Hanoverian rat, said by the\r\nJacobites to have come in with the first George, and established\r\nitself after the fashion of his royal family; and undoubtedly such\r\nwas about the era of their appearance. One man, who had worked twelve\r\nyears in the sewers before flushing was general, told me he had never\r\nseen but _two_ black (or old English) rats; another man, of ten years’\r\nexperience, had seen but one; others had noted no difference in the\r\nrats. I may observe that in my inquiries as to the sale of rats (as\r\na part of the live animals dealt in by a class in the metropolis), I\r\nascertained that in the older granaries, where there were series of\r\nfloors, there were black as well as brown rats. “Great black fellows,”\r\nsaid one man who managed a Bermondsey granary, “as would frighten a\r\nlady into asterisks to see of a sudden.”\r\n\r\nThe rat is the only animal found in the sewers. I met with no\r\nflusherman or other sewer-worker who had ever seen a lizard, toad,\r\nor frog there, although the existence of these creatures, in such\r\ncircumstances, has been presumed. A few live cats find their way\r\ninto the subterranean channels when a house-drain is being built,\r\nor is opened for repairs, or for any purpose, and have been seen by\r\nthe flushermen, &c., wandering about, looking lost, mewing as if in\r\nmisery, and avoiding any contact with the sewage. The rats also--for\r\nthey are not of the water-rat breed--are exceedingly averse to wetting\r\ntheir feet, and “take to the sewage,” as it was worded to me, only\r\nin prospect of danger; that is, they then swim across or along the\r\ncurrent to escape with their lives. It is said that when a luckless\r\ncat has ventured into the sewers, she is sometimes literally worried\r\nby the rats. I could not hear of such an attack having been witnessed\r\nby any one; but one intelligent and trustworthy man said, that a few\r\nyears back (he believed about eight years) he had in one week found the\r\nskeletons of two cats in a particular part of an old sewer, 21 feet\r\nwide, and in the drains opening into it were perfect colonies of rats,\r\nraging with hunger, he had no doubt, because a system of trapping,\r\nnewly resorted to, had prevented their usual ingress into the houses\r\nup the drains. A portion of their fur adhered to the two cats, but the\r\nflesh had been eaten from their bones. About that time a troop of rats\r\nflew at the feet of another of my informants, and would no doubt have\r\nmaimed him seriously, “but my boots,” said he, “stopped the devils.”\r\n“The sewers generally swarms with rats,” said another man. “I runs away\r\nfrom ’em; I don’t like ’em. They in general gets away from us; but in\r\ncase we comes to a stunt end where there’s a wall and no place for ’em\r\nto get away, and we goes to touch ’em, they fly at us. They’re some of\r\n’em as big as good-sized kittens. One of our men caught hold of one the\r\nother day by the tail, and he found it trying to release itself, and\r\nthe tail slipping through his fingers; so he put up his left hand to\r\nstop it, and the rat caught hold of his finger, and the man’s got an\r\narm now as big as his thigh.” I heard from several that there had been\r\noccasionally battles among the rats, one with another.\r\n\r\n“Why, sir,” said one flusherman, “as to the number of rats, it ain’t\r\npossible to say. There hasn’t been a census (laughing) taken of\r\nthem. But I can tell you this--I was one of the first flushermen\r\nwhen flushing came in general--I think it was before Christmas,\r\n1847, under Mr. Roe--and there was cart-loads and cart-loads of\r\ndrowned rats carried into the Thames. It was in a West Strand _shore_\r\nthat I saw the most. I don’t exactly remember which, but I think\r\nNorthumberland-street. By a block or a hitch of some sort, there was,\r\nI should say, just a bushel of drowned rats stopped at the corner of\r\none of the gates, which I swept into the next stream. I see far fewer\r\ndrowned rats now than before the _shores_ was flushed. They’re not so\r\nplenty, that’s one thing. Perhaps, too, they may have got to understand\r\nabout flushing, they’re that ’cute, and manage to keep out of the way.\r\nAbout Newgate-market was at one time the worst for rats. Men couldn’t\r\nventure into the sewers then, on account of the varmint. It’s bad\r\nenough still, I hear, but I haven’t worked in the City for a few years.”\r\n\r\nThe rats, from the best information at my command, do not derive\r\nmuch of their sustenance from the matter in the sewers, or only in\r\nparticular localities. These localities are the sewers neighbouring\r\na connected series of slaughter-houses, as in Newgate-market,\r\nWhitechapel, Clare-market, parts adjoining Smithfield-market, &c.\r\nThere, animal offal being (and having been to a much greater extent\r\nfive or six years ago) swept into the drains and sewers, the rats\r\nfind their food. In the sewers, generally, there is little food for\r\nthem, and none at all in the best-constructed sewers, where there is a\r\nregular and sometimes rapid flow, and little or no deposit.\r\n\r\nThe sewers are these animals’ breeding grounds. In them the broods\r\nare usually safe from the molestation of men, dogs, or cats. These\r\n“breeding grounds” are sometimes in the holes (excavated by the\r\nindustry of the rats into caves) which have been formed in the old\r\nsewers by a crumbled brick having fallen out. Their nests, however,\r\nare in some parts even more frequent in places where old rotting large\r\nhouse-drains or smaller sewers, empty themselves into a first-class\r\nsewer. Here, then, the rats breed, and, in spite of precautions, find\r\ntheir way up the drains or pipes, even through the openings into\r\nwater-closets, into the houses for their food, and almost always at\r\nnight. Of this fact, builders, and those best informed, are confident,\r\nand it is proved indirectly by what I have stated as to the deficiency\r\nof food for a voracious creature in all the sewers except a few.\r\nOne man, long in the service of the Commissioners of Sewers, and in\r\ndifferent capacities, gave me the following account of what may be\r\ncalled a rat settlement. The statement I found confirmed by other\r\nworking men, and by superior officers under the same employment.\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, in the Milford-lane sewer, a goodish bit before you get to\r\nthe river, or to the Strand--I can’t say how far, a few hundred yards\r\nperhaps--I’ve seen, and reported, what was a regular chamber of rats.\r\nIf a brick didn’t fall out from being rotted, the rats would get it\r\nout, and send it among other rubbish into the sewer, for this place was\r\njust the corner of a big drain. I couldn’t get into the rat-hole, of\r\ncourse not, but I’ve brought my lamp to the opening, and--as well as\r\nothers--have seen it plain. It was an open place like a lot of tunnels,\r\none over another. Like a lot of rabbit burrows in the country--as I’ve\r\nknown to be--or like the partitions in the pigeon-houses: one here and\r\nanother there. The rat-holes, as far as I could tell, were worked one\r\nafter another. I should say, in moderation, that it was the size of a\r\nsmall room; well, say about 6 yards by 4. I can’t say about the height\r\nfrom the lowest tunnel to the highest. I don’t see that any one could.\r\nBless you, sir, I’ve sometimes heerd the rats fighting and squeaking\r\nthere, like a parcel of drunken Irishmen--I have indeed. Some of them\r\nwere rare big fellows. If you threw the light of your lamp on them\r\nsudden, they’d be off like a shot. Well, I should say, there was 100\r\npair of rats there--there might be more, besides all their young-uns.\r\nIf a poor cat strayed into that sewer, she dursn’t tackle the rats, not\r\nshe. There’s lots of such places, sir, here, and there, and everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“I believe rats,” says a late enthusiastic writer on the subject, under\r\nthe cognomen of Uncle James, “to be one of the most fertile causes\r\nof national and universal distress, and their attendants, misery and\r\nstarvation.”\r\n\r\nFrom the author’s inquiries among practical men, and from his own study\r\nof the natural history of the rat, he shows that these animals will\r\nhave six, seven, or eight nests of young in the year, for three or four\r\nyears together; that they have from twelve to twenty-three at a litter,\r\nand breed at three months old; and that there are more female than male\r\nrats, by ten to six.\r\n\r\nThe author seems somewhat of an enthusiast about rats, and as\r\nthe sewerage is often the head-quarters of these animals--their\r\n“breeding-ground” indeed--I extract the following curious matter. He\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n“Now, I propose to lay down my calculations at something less than\r\none-half. In the first place, I say four litters in the year, beginning\r\nand ending with a litter, so making thirteen litters in three years;\r\nsecondly to have eight young ones at a birth, half male and half\r\nfemale; thirdly, the young ones to have a litter at six months old.\r\n\r\n“At this calculation, I will take one pair of rats; and at the\r\nexpiration of three years what do you suppose will be the amount of\r\nliving rats? Why no less a number than 646,808.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Shaw’s little dog ‘Tiny,’ under six pounds weight, has destroyed\r\n2525 pairs of rats, which, had they been permitted to live, would, at\r\nthe same calculation and in the same time, have produced 1,633,190,200\r\nliving rats!\r\n\r\n“And the rats destroyed by Messrs. Shaw and Sabin in one year,\r\namounting to 17,000 pairs, would, had they been permitted to live, have\r\nproduced, at the above calculation and in the same time, no less a\r\nnumber than 10,995,736,000 living rats!\r\n\r\n“Now, let us calculate the amount of human food that these rats would\r\ndestroy. In the first place, my informants tell me that six rats will\r\nconsume day by day as much food as a man; secondly, that the thing has\r\nbeen tested, and that the estimate given was, that eight rats would\r\nconsume more than an ordinary man.\r\n\r\n“Now, I--to place the thing beyond the smallest shadow of a doubt--will\r\nset down ten rats to eat as much as a man, not a child; nor will I\r\nsay anything about what rats waste. And what shall we find to be the\r\nalarming result? Why, that the first pair of rats, with their three\r\nyears’ progeny, would consume in the night more food than 64,680 men\r\nthe year round, and leaving eight rats to spare!”\r\n\r\nThe author then puts forth the following curious statement:--\r\n\r\n“And now for the vermin destroyed by Messrs. Shaw and Sabin--34,000\r\nyearly! Taken at the same calculation, with their three years’\r\nprogeny--can you believe it?--they would consume more food than the\r\nwhole population of the earth? Yes, if Omnipotence would raise up\r\n29,573,600 more people, these rats would consume as much food as them\r\nall! You may wonder, but I will prove it to you:--The population of\r\nthe earth, including men, women, and children, is estimated to be\r\n970,000,000 souls; and the 17,000 rats in three years would produce\r\n10,995,736,000: consequently, at ten rats per man, there would be\r\nsufficient rats to eat as much food as all the people on the earth,\r\nand leaving 1,295,736,000. So that if the human family were increased\r\nto 1,099,573,600, instead of 970,000,000, there would be rats enough\r\nto eat the food of them all! Now, sirs, is not this a most appalling\r\nthing, to think that there are at the present time in the British\r\nEmpire thousands--nay, millions--of human beings in a state of utter\r\nstarvation, while rats are consuming that which would place them and\r\ntheir families in a state of affluence and comfort? I ask this simple\r\nquestion: Has not Parliament, ere now, been summoned upon matters of\r\nfar less importance to the empire? I think it has.”\r\n\r\nThe author then advocates the repeal of the “rat-tax,” that is, the\r\ntax on what he calls the “true friend of man and remorseless destroyer\r\nof rats,” the well-bred terrier dog. “Take the tax off rat-killing\r\ndogs” he says, “and give a legality to rat-killing, and let there be in\r\neach parish a man who will pay a reward per head for dead rats, which\r\nare valuable for manure (as was done in the case of wolves in the old\r\ndays), and then rats would be extinguished for ever!” Uncle James seems\r\nto be a perfect Malthus among rats. The over-population and over-rat\r\ntheories are about equal in reason.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RAT-CATCHERS OF THE SEWERS.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CESSPOOLAGE AND NIGHTMEN OF THE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\nI have already shown--it may be necessary to remind the reader--that\r\nthere are two modes of removing the wet refuse of the metropolis: the\r\none by carrying it off by means of sewers, or, as it is designated,\r\n_sewerage_; and the other by depositing it in some neighbouring\r\ncesspool, or what is termed _cesspoolage_.\r\n\r\nThe object of sewerage is “to transport the wet refuse of a town to a\r\nriver, or some powerfully current stream, by a series of ducts.” By the\r\nsystem of cesspoolage, the wet refuse of the household is collected\r\nin an adjacent tank, and when the reservoir is full, the contents are\r\nremoved to some other part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONDON NIGHTMEN.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nThe gross quantity of wet refuse annually produced in the metropolis,\r\nand which consequently has to be removed by one or other of the above\r\nmeans, is, as we have seen,--liquid, 24,000,000,000 gallons; solid,\r\n100,000 tons; or altogether, by admeasurement, 3,820,000,000 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of this wet refuse which finds its way into the sewers\r\nby street and house-drainage is, according to the experiments of the\r\nCommissioners of Sewers (as detailed at p. 388), 10,000,000 cubic feet\r\nper day, or 3,650,000,000 cubic feet per annum, so that there remain\r\nabout 170,000,000 cubic feet to be accounted for. But, as we have\r\nbefore seen, the extent of surface from which the amount of so-called\r\n_Metropolitan_ sewage was _removed_ was only 58 square miles, whereas\r\nthat from which the calculation was made concerning the gross quantity\r\nof wet refuse _produced_ throughout the metropolis was 115 square\r\nmiles, or double the size. The 58 miles measured by the Commissioners,\r\nhowever, was by far the denser moiety of the town, and that in which\r\nthe houses and streets were as 15 to 1; so that, allowing the remaining\r\n58 miles of the suburban districts to have produced 20 times less\r\nsewage than the urban half of the metropolis, the extra yield would\r\nhave been about 180,500,000 cubic feet. But the greater proportion,\r\nif not the whole, of the latter quantity of wet house-refuse would be\r\ndrained into open ditches, where a considerable amount of evaporation\r\nand absorption is continually going on, so that a large allowance must\r\nbe made for loss by these means. Perhaps, if we estimate the quantity\r\nof sewage thus absorbed and evaporated at between 10 and 20 per cent of\r\nthe whole, we shall not be wide of the truth, so that we shall have to\r\nreduce the 182,000,000 cubic feet of suburban sewage to somewhere about\r\n150,000,000 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nThis gives us the quantity of wet refuse carried off by the sewers\r\n(covered and open) of the metropolis, and deducted from the gross\r\nquantity of wet house-refuse, annually _produced_ (3,820,000,000 cubic\r\nfeet), leaves 20,000,000 cubic feet for the gross quantity carried\r\noff by other means than the sewers; that is to say, the 20,000,000\r\ncubic feet, if the calculation be right, should be about the quantity\r\ndeposited every year in the London cesspools. Let us see whether this\r\napproximates to anything like the real quantity.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the absolute quantity of wet refuse annually conveyed into\r\nthe metropolitan cesspools, we must first ascertain the number and\r\ncapacity of the cesspools themselves.\r\n\r\nOf the city of London, where the sewer-cesspool details are given with\r\na minuteness highly commendable, as affording statistical data of great\r\nvalue, Mr. Heywood gives us the following returns:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“HOUSE-DRAINAGE OF THE CITY.\r\n\r\n  “The total number of premises\r\n  drained during the year was           310\r\n\r\n  “The approximate number of\r\n  premises drained at the expiration\r\n  of the year 1850 was               10,923\r\n\r\n  “The total number of premises\r\n  which may now therefore be said\r\n  to be drained is                   11,233\r\n\r\n  “And undrained                      5,067\r\n\r\n“I am induced,” adds Mr. Heywood, “to believe, from the reports of\r\nthe district inspectors, that a very far larger number of houses are\r\nalready drained than are herein given. Indeed my impression is, that as\r\nmany as 3000 might be deducted from the 5067 houses as to the drainage\r\nof which you have no information.\r\n\r\n“Now, until the inspectors have completed their survey of the whole\r\nof the houses within the city,” continues the City surveyor, “precise\r\ninformation cannot be given as to the number of houses yet undrained;\r\nsuch information appears to me very important to obtain speedily, and\r\nI beg to recommend that instructions be given to the inspectors to\r\nproceed with their survey as rapidly as possible.”\r\n\r\nHence it appears, that out of the 16,299 houses comprised within the\r\nboundaries of the City, rather less than one-third are _reported_ to\r\nhave cesspools. Concerning the number of cesspools without the City,\r\nthe Board of Health, in a Report on the cholera in 1849, put forward\r\none of its usual _extraordinary_ statements.\r\n\r\n“At the last census in 1841,” runs the Report, “there were 270,859\r\nhouses in the metropolis. _It is_ KNOWN _that there is scarcely a house\r\nwithout a cesspool under it, and that a large number have two, three,\r\nfour, and_ MORE _under them_; so that the number of such receptacles\r\nin the metropolis may be taken at 300,000. The exposed surface of each\r\ncesspool measures on an average 9 feet, and the mean depth of the\r\nwhole is about 6-1/2 feet; so that each contains 58-1/2 cubic feet of\r\nfermenting filth of the most poisonous, noisome, and disgusting nature.\r\nThe exhaling surface of all the cesspools (300,000 × 9) = 2,700,000\r\nfeet, or equal to 62 acres nearly; and the total quantity of foul\r\nmatter contained within them (300,000 × 58-1/2) = 17,550,000 cubic\r\nfeet; or equal to one enormous elongated stagnant cesspool 50 feet in\r\nwidth, 6 feet 6 inches in depth, and extending through London from the\r\nBroadway at Hammersmith to Bow-bridge, a length of 10 miles.\r\n\r\n“This,” say the Metropolitan Sanitary Commissioners, a body of\r\nfunctionaries so intimately connected with the Board, that the one is\r\never ready to swear to what the other asserts, “there is reason to\r\nbelieve is an _under estimate!_”\r\n\r\nLet us now compare this statement, which declares it to be _known_ that\r\nthere is scarcely a house in London without a cesspool, and that many\r\nhave two, three, four, and even more under them--let us compare this,\r\nI say, with the facts which were elicited by the same functionaries\r\nby means of a house-to-house inquiry in three different parishes--a\r\npoor, a middle-class, and a rich one--the average rental of each being\r\n22_l._, 119_l._, and 128_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF A HOUSE-TO-HOUSE INQUIRY IN THE PARISHES OF ST.

In the poorer parish of St. George the Martyr,\r\nSouthwark, the cesspools were to every 100 houses as 82·12; in the\r\naristocratic parish of St. James, Westminster, as only 36·62; while in\r\nwhat may be represented, perhaps, as the middle-class parish of St.\r\nAnne, Soho, the cesspools were 47·27 per cent. The number of wells on\r\nor near the premises, and the proportion of those tainted; the ratio of\r\nthe dampness of the lower parts of the houses, of the stagnant water on\r\nthe premises, and of the flooding of the houses on occasions of storms,\r\nare all significant indications of the difference in the circumstances\r\nof the inhabitants of these parishes--of the difference between the\r\nabodes of the rich and the poor, the capitalists and the labouring\r\nclasses. But more significant still, perhaps, of the domestic wants or\r\ncomforts of these dwellings, is the proportion of water-closets to the\r\nhouses in the poor parish and the rich; in the one they were but 10·06\r\nper cent; in the other 65·86 per cent.\r\n\r\nThese returns are sufficient to show the extravagance of the Board’s\r\nprevious statement, that there is “scarcely a house in London without\r\na cesspool under it,” while “a large number have two, three, four, and\r\nmore,” for we find that even in the poorer parishes there are only 82\r\ncesspools to 100 houses. Moreover, the engineers, after an official\r\nexamination and inquiry, reported that in the “fever-nest, known as\r\nJacob’s-island, Bermondsey,” there were 1317 dwelling-houses and 648\r\ncesspools, or not quite 50 cesspools to 100 houses.\r\n\r\nIn rich, middle-class, and poor parishes, the proportion of cesspools,\r\nthen, it appears from the _inquiries_ of the Board of Health (their\r\n_guesses_ are of no earthly value), gives us an average of something\r\nbetween 50 or 60 cesspools to every 100 houses. A subordinate officer\r\nwhom I saw, and who was engaged in the cleansing and the filling-up\r\nof cesspools when condemned, or when the houses are to be drained\r\nanew into the sewers and the cesspools abolished, thought from his\r\nown experience, the number of cesspools to be less than one-half, but\r\nothers thought it more.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a nightman told me he was confident that every two\r\nhouses in three throughout London had cesspools; in the City, however,\r\nwe perceive that there is, at the utmost, only one house in every three\r\nundrained. It will, therefore, be safest to adopt a middle course, and\r\nassume 50 per cent of the houses of the metropolis to be still without\r\ndrainage into the sewers.\r\n\r\nNow the number of houses being 300,000, it follows that the number\r\nof cesspools within the area of the metropolis are about 150,000;\r\nconsequently the next step in the investigation is to ascertain the\r\naverage capacity of each, and so arrive at the gross quantity of wet\r\nhouse-refuse annually deposited in cesspools throughout London.\r\n\r\nThe average size of the cesspools throughout the metropolis is said, by\r\nthe Board of Health, to be 9 feet by 6-1/2, which gives a capacity of\r\n58-1/2 cubic feet, and this for 150,000 houses = 8,775,000 cubic feet.\r\nBut according to all accounts these cesspools require on an average\r\ntwo years to fill, so that the gross quantity of wet refuse annually\r\ndeposited in such places can be taken at only half the above quantity,\r\nviz. in round numbers, 4,500,000 cubic feet. This by weight, at the\r\nrate of 35·9 cubic feet to the ton, gives 125,345 tons. This, however,\r\nwould appear to be of a piece with the generality of the statistics of\r\nthe Board of Health, and as wide of the truth as was the statement that\r\nthere was scarcely a house in London without a cesspool, while many\r\nhad _three, four, and even more_. But I am credibly informed that the\r\naverage size of a cesspool is rather more than 5 feet square and 6-1/2\r\ndeep, so that the ordinary capacity would be 5-3/4 × 5-1/4 × 6-1/2\r\n= 197 cubic feet, and this multiplied by 150,000 gives an aggregate\r\ncapacity of 29,550,000 cubit feet. But as the cesspools, according\r\nto all accounts, become full only once in two years, it follows that\r\nthe gross quantity of cesspoolage annually deposited throughout the\r\nmetropolis must be only one-half that quantity, or about 14,775,000\r\ncubic feet.\r\n\r\nThe calculation may be made another way, viz. by the experience of the\r\nnightmen and the sewer-cesspoolmen as to the average quantity of refuse\r\nremoved from the London cesspools whenever emptied, as well as the\r\naverage number emptied yearly.\r\n\r\nThe contents of a cesspool are never estimated for any purpose of sale\r\nor labour by the weight, but always, as regards the nightmen’s work, by\r\nthe load. Each night-cart load of soil is considered, on an average, a\r\nton in weight, so that the nightmen readily estimate the number of tons\r\nby the number of cart-loads obtained. The men employed in the cleansing\r\nof the cesspools by the new system of pumping agree with the nightmen\r\nas to the average contents of a cesspool.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, a cesspool is filled every two years, and holds,\r\nwhen full, about five tons. One man, who had been upwards of 30 years\r\nin the nightman’s business, who had worked at it more or less all\r\nthat time himself, and who is now foreman to a parish contractor and\r\nmaster-nightman in a large way, spoke positively on the subject. The\r\ncesspools, he declared, were emptied, as an average, by nightmen, once\r\nin two years, and their average contents were five loads of night-soil,\r\nit having been always understood in the trade that a night-cartload\r\nwas about a ton.[72] The total of the cesspool matter is not affected\r\nby the frequency or paucity of the cleansing away of the filth, for if\r\none cesspool be emptied yearly, another is emptied every second, third,\r\nfourth, or fifth year, and, according to the size, the fair average\r\nis five tons of cesspoolage emptied from each every other year. One\r\nmaster-nightman had emptied as much as fourteen tons of night-soil\r\nfrom a cesspool or soil-tank, and a contractor’s man had once emptied\r\nas many as eighteen tons, but both agreed as to the average of\r\nfive tons every two years from all. Neither knew the period of the\r\naccumulation of the fourteen or the eighteen tons, but supposed to be\r\nabout five or six years.\r\n\r\nAccording to this mode of estimate, the quantity of wet house-refuse\r\ndeposited in cesspools would be equal to 150,000 × 5, or 750,000 tons\r\nevery two years. This, by admeasurement, at the rate of 35·9 cubic\r\nfeet to the ton, gives 26,925,000 cubic feet; and as this is the\r\naccumulation of two years, it follows that 13,462,500 cubic feet is the\r\nquantity of cesspoolage deposited yearly.\r\n\r\nThere is still another mode of checking this estimate.\r\n\r\nI have already given (see p. 385, _ante_) the average production of\r\neach individual to the wet refuse of the metropolis. According to the\r\nexperiments of Boussingault, confirmed by Liebig, this, as I have\r\nstated, amounted to 1/4 lb. of solid and 1-1/4 lb. of liquid excrement\r\nfrom each individual per diem (= 150 lbs. for every 100 persons),\r\nwhile, including the wet refuse from culinary operations, the average\r\nyield, according to the surveyor of the Commissioners of Sewers, was\r\nequal to about 250 lbs. for every 100 individuals daily. I may add that\r\nthis calculation was made officially, with engineering minuteness, with\r\na view to ascertain what quantity of water, and what inclination in\r\nits flow, would be required for the effective working of a system of\r\ndrainage to supersede the cesspools.[73] Now the census of 1841 shows\r\nus that the average number of inhabitants to each house throughout the\r\nmetropolis was 7·6, and this for 150,000 houses would give 1,140,000\r\npeople; consequently the gross quantity of wet refuse proceeding from\r\nthis number of persons, at the rate of 250 lbs. to every 100 people\r\ndaily, would be 464,400 tons per annum; or, by admeasurement, at the\r\nrate of 35·9 cubic feet to the ton, it would be equal to 16,670,950\r\ncubic feet.\r\n\r\nA small proportion of this amount of cesspoolage ultimately makes its\r\nappearance in the sewers, being pumped into them directly from the\r\ncesspools when full by means of a special apparatus, and thus tends not\r\nonly to swell the bulk of sewage, but to decrease in a like proportion\r\nthe aggregate quantity of wet house-refuse, which is removed by\r\ncartage; but though the proportion of cesspoolage which finally appears\r\nas sewage is daily increasing, still it is but trifling compared with\r\nthe quantity removed by cartage.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have three different estimates as to the gross quantity\r\nof the London cesspoolage, each slightly varying from the other two.\r\n\r\n  The first, drawn from the            Cubic Feet.\r\n  average capacity of the London\r\n  cesspools, makes the gross\r\n  annual amount of cesspoolage         14,775,000\r\n\r\n  The second, deduced from\r\n  the average quantity removed\r\n  from each cesspool                   13,462,500\r\n\r\n  And the third, calculated\r\n  from the individual production\r\n  of wet refuse                        16,670,950\r\n\r\nThe mean of these three results is, in round numbers, 15,000,000 cubic\r\nfeet, so that the statement would stand thus:--\r\n\r\n  The quantity of wet house-refuse\r\n  annually carried off by\r\n  sewers (chiefly covered) from\r\n  the urban moiety of the metropolis\r\n  is (in cubic feet)                3,650,000,000\r\n\r\n  The quantity annually carried\r\n  off by sewers (principally\r\n  open) from the suburban moiety\r\n  of the metropolis                   150,000,000\r\n                                    -------------\r\n  The total amount of wet\r\n  house-refuse annually carried\r\n  off by the sewers of the metropolis\r\n                                    3,800,000,000\r\n\r\n  The gross amount of wet\r\n  house-refuse annually deposited\r\n  in cesspools throughout\r\n  the metropolis                       15,000,000\r\n                                    -------------\r\n  The total amount of sewage\r\n  and cesspoolage of the metropolis\r\n                                    3,815,000,000\r\n\r\nThus we perceive that the total quantity of wet house-refuse annually\r\n_removed_, corresponds so closely with the gross quantity of wet\r\nhouse-refuse annually _produced_, that we may briefly conclude the\r\ngross sewage of London to be equal to 3,800,000,000 cubic feet, and the\r\ngross cesspoolage to be equal to 15,000,000 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of the above conclusion may be tested by another process;\r\nfor, unless the Board of Health’s conjectural mode of getting at\r\n_facts_ be adopted, it is absolutely necessary that statistics not only\r\nupon this, but indeed any subject, be checked by all the different\r\nmodes there may be of arriving at the same conclusion. False facts are\r\nworse than no facts at all.\r\n\r\nThe number of nightmen may be summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Masters            521\r\n  Labourers      200,000\r\n\r\nThe number of cesspools emptied during the past year by these men may\r\nbe estimated at 50,692; and the quantity of soil removed, 253,460\r\nloads, or tons, and this at the rate of 35·9 cubic ft. to the ton gives\r\na total of 6,099,214 cubic ft.\r\n\r\nIt might, perhaps, be expected, that from the quantity of fæcal refuse\r\nproceeding from the inhabitants of the metropolis, a greater quantity\r\nwould be found in the existent cesspools; but there are many reasons\r\nfor the contrary.\r\n\r\nOne prime cause of the dispersion of cesspoolage is, that a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the night-soil does not find its way into the\r\ncesspools at all, but is, when the inhabitants have no privies to their\r\ndwellings, thrown into streets, and courts, and waste places.\r\n\r\nI cannot show this better than by a few extracts from Dr. Hector\r\nGavin’s work, published in 1848, entitled, “Sanitary Ramblings; being\r\nSketches and Illustrations of Bethnal Green, &c.”\r\n\r\n“_Digby-walk, Globe-road._--Part of this place is private property,\r\nand the landlord of the new houses has built a cesspool, into which to\r\ndrain his houses, but he will not permit the other houses to drain into\r\nthis cesspool, unless the parish pay to him 1_l._, a sum which it will\r\nnot pay.” Of course the inhabitants throw their garbage and filth into\r\nthe street or the by-places.\r\n\r\n“_Whisker’s-gardens._--This is a very extensive piece of ground,\r\nwhich is laid out in neat plots, as gardens. The choicest flowers are\r\nfrequently raised here, and great taste and considerable refinement\r\nare evidently possessed by those who cultivate them. Now, among the\r\ncultivators are the poor, even the very poor, of Bethnal-green....\r\nAttached to all these little plots of ground are summer-houses. In the\r\ngenerality of cases they are mere wooden sheds, cabins, or huts. It\r\nis very greatly to be regretted that the proprietors of these gardens\r\nshould permit the slight and fragile sheds in them to be converted into\r\nabodes for human beings.... Sometimes they are divided into rooms; they\r\nare planted on the damp undrained ground. The privies are sheds erected\r\nover holes in the ground; the _soil itself_ is removed from these holes\r\nand is _dug into the ground_ to promote its fertility.\r\n\r\n“_Three Colt-lane._--A deep ditch has been dug on either side of the\r\nEastern Counties Railway by the Company. These ditches were dug by the\r\nCompany to prevent the foundations of the arches being endangered,\r\nand are in no way to be considered as having been dug to promote the\r\nhealth of the neighbourhood. The double privies attached to the new\r\nhouses (22 in number) are immediately contiguous to this ditch, and\r\nare constructed so that the night-soil shall drain into it. For this\r\npurpose the cesspools are small, and the bottoms are above the level of\r\nthe ditch.”\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to multiply such proofs of night-soil not finding its\r\nway into the cesspools, but the subject need not be further pursued,\r\nimportant as in many respects it may be. I need but say, that in the\r\nseveral reports of the Board of Health are similar accounts of other\r\nlocalities. The same deficiency of cesspoolage is found in Paris, and\r\nfrom the same cause.\r\n\r\nWhat may be the quantity of night-soil which becomes part of the\r\ncontents of the street scavenger’s instead of the nightman’s cart,\r\nno steps have been taken, or perhaps can be taken, by the public\r\nsanitary bodies to ascertain. Many of the worst of the nuisances\r\n(such as that in Digby-street) have been abolished, but they are still\r\ntoo characteristic of the very poor districts. The fault, however,\r\nappears to be with the owners of property, and it is seldom _they_ are\r\ncoerced into doing their duty. The doubt of its “paying” a capitalist\r\nlandlord to improve the unwholesome dwellings of the poor seems to be\r\nregarded as a far more sacred right, than the right of the people to be\r\ndelivered from the foul air and vile stenches to which their poverty\r\nmay condemn them.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, the great but unascertained waste from cesspool\r\nevaporation, and it must be recollected that of the 2-1/2 lbs. of\r\ncesspool refuse, calculated as the daily produce of each individual,\r\n2-1/4 lbs. are liquid.\r\n\r\nThe gross cesspoolage of Paris should amount to upwards of 600,000\r\ncubic mètres, or more than 21,000,000 cubic feet, at the estimate of\r\nthree pints daily per head. The quantity actually collected, however,\r\namounts to only 230,000 cubic mètres, or rather more than 8,000,000\r\ncubic feet, which is 13,000,000 cubic feet less than the amount\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIn London, the cesspoolage of 150,000 _undrained_ houses should, at\r\nthe rate of 2-1/2 lbs. to each individual and 15 inhabitants to every\r\ntwo houses, amount to 16,500,000 cubic feet, or about 460,000 loads,\r\nwhereas the quantity collected amounts to but little more than 250,000\r\nloads, or about 9,000,000 cubic feet. Hence, the deficiency is 210,000\r\nloads, or 7,500,000 cubic feet, which is nearly half of the entire\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, then, it would appear that only 38 per cent of the refuse\r\nwhich is not removed by sewers is collected in the cesspools, whereas\r\nin London about 54-1/2 per cent is so collected. The remainder in both\r\ncases is part deposited in by-places and removed by the scavenger’s\r\ncart, part lost in evaporation, whereas a large proportion of the\r\ndeficiency arises from a less quantity of water than the amount stated\r\nbeing used by the very poor.\r\n\r\nWe have now to see the means by which this 15,000,000 cubic feet of\r\ncesspoolage is annually removed, as well as to ascertain the condition\r\nand incomes of the labourers engaged in the removal of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CESSPOOL SYSTEM OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nA cesspool, or some equivalent contrivance, has long existed in\r\nconnexion with the structure of the better class of houses in the\r\nmetropolis, and there seems every reason to believe--though I am\r\nassured, on good authority, that there is no public or official record\r\nof the matter known to exist--that their use became more and more\r\ngeneral, as in the case of the sewers, after the rebuilding of the\r\nCity, consequent upon the great fire of 1666.\r\n\r\nThe older cesspools were of two kinds--“soil-tanks” and “bog-holes.”\r\n\r\n“Soil-tanks” were the filth receptacles of the larger houses, and\r\nsometimes works of solid masonry; they were almost every size and\r\ndepth, but always perhaps much deeper than the modern cesspools, which\r\npresent an average depth of 6 feet to 6-1/2 feet.\r\n\r\nThe “bog-hole” was, and is, a cavity dug into the earth, having less\r\nmasonry than the soil-tank, and sometimes no masonry at all, being in\r\nlike manner the receptacle for the wet refuse from the house.\r\n\r\nThe difference between these old contrivances and the present mode\r\nis principally in the following respect: the soil-tank or bog-hole\r\nformed a receptacle immediately under the privy (the floor of which has\r\nusually to be removed for purposes of cleansing), whereas the refuse\r\nis now more frequently carried into the modern cesspool by a system of\r\ndrainage. Sometimes the soil-tank was, when the nature of the situation\r\nof the premises permitted, in some outer place, such as an obscure\r\npart of the garden or court-yard; and perhaps two or more bog-holes\r\nwere drained into it, while often enough, by means of a grate or a\r\ntrap-door, any kind of refuse to be got rid of was thrown into it.\r\n\r\nI am informed that the average contents of a bog-hole (such as now\r\nexist) are a cubic yard of matter; some are round, some oblong, for\r\nthere is, or was, great variation.\r\n\r\nOf the few remaining soil-tanks the varying sizes prevent any average\r\nbeing computable.\r\n\r\nWhat the old system of cesspoolage _was_ may be judged from the fact,\r\nthat until somewhere about 1830 no cesspool matter could, without an\r\nindictable offence being committed, be drained into a sewer! _Now_,\r\nno new house can be erected, but it is an indictable offence if the\r\ncesspool (or rather water-closet) matter be drained anywhere else\r\nthan into the sewer! The law, at the period specified, required most\r\nstrangely, so that “the drains and sewers might not be choked,” that\r\ncesspools should “be not only periodically emptied, but _made_ by\r\nnightmen.”\r\n\r\nThe principal means of effecting the change from cesspoolage to\r\nsewerage was the introduction of Bramah’s water-closets, patented in\r\n1808, but not brought into general use for some twenty years or more\r\nafter that date. The houses of the rich, owing to the refuse being\r\ndrained away from the premises, improved both in wholesomeness and\r\nagreeableness, and so the law was relaxed.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of cesspools, viz. _public_ and _private_.\r\n\r\nThe _public cesspools_ are those situated in courts, alleys, and\r\nplaces, which, though often packed thickly with inhabitants, are not\r\nhorse-thoroughfares, or thoroughfares at all; and in such places one,\r\ntwo, or more cesspools receive the refuse from all the houses. I do not\r\nknow that any official account of public cesspools has been published\r\nas to their number, character, &c., but their number is insignificant\r\nwhen compared with those connected with private houses. The public\r\ncesspools are cleansed, and, where possible, filled up by order of the\r\nCommissioners of Sewers, the cost being then defrayed out of the rate.\r\n\r\nThe _private cesspools_ are cleansed at the expense of the occupiers of\r\nthe houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CESSPOOL AND SEWER SYSTEM OF PARIS.\r\n\r\nAs the Court of Sewers have recently adopted some of the French\r\nregulations concerning cesspoolage, I will now give an account of the\r\ncesspool system of France.\r\n\r\nWhen after the ravages of the epidemic cholera of 1848-9, sanitary\r\ncommissioners under the authority of the legislature pursued their\r\ninquiries, it was deemed essential to report upon the cesspool system\r\nof Paris, as that capital had also been ravaged by the epidemic. The\r\ntask was entrusted to Mr. T. W. Rammell, C.E.\r\n\r\nEven in what the French delight to designate--and in some respects\r\njustly--the most refined city in the world, a filthy and indolent\r\ncustom, once common, as I have shown, in England, still prevails.\r\nIn Paris, the kitchen and _dry_ house-refuse (and formerly it was\r\nthe fæcal refuse also) is deposited in the dark of the night in the\r\nstreets, and removed, as soon as the morning light permits, by the\r\npublic scavengers. But the refuse is not removed unexamined before\r\nbeing thrown into the cart of the proper functionary. There is in Paris\r\na large and peculiar class, the chiffonniers (literally, in Anglo-Saxon\r\nrendering, the _raggers_, or rag-finders). These men nightly traverse\r\nthe streets, each provided with a lantern, and generally with a basket\r\nstrapped to the back; the poorer sort, however--for poverty, like rank,\r\nhas its gradations--make a bag answer the purpose; they have also a\r\npole with an iron hook to its end; and a small shovel. The dirt-heaps\r\nor mounds of dry house-refuse are carefully turned over by these men;\r\nfor their morrow’s bread, as in the case of our own street-finders,\r\ndepends upon _something_ saleable being acquired. Their prizes are\r\nbones (which sometimes they are seen to gnaw); bits of bread; wasted\r\npotatoes; broken pots, bottles, and glass; old pans and odd pieces of\r\nold metal; cigar-ends; waste-paper, and rags. Although these people are\r\nknown as rag-pickers, rags are, perhaps, the very thing of which they\r\npick the least, because the Parisians are least apt to throw them away.\r\nIn some of the criminal trials in the French capital, the chiffonniers\r\nhave given evidence (but not much of late) of what they have found\r\nin a certain locality, and supplied a link, sometimes an important\r\none, to the evidence against a criminal. With these refuse heaps is\r\nstill sometimes mixed matter which should have found its way into the\r\ncesspools, although this is an offence punishable, and occasionally\r\npunished.\r\n\r\nBefore the habits of the Parisians are too freely condemned, let it be\r\nborne in mind that the houses of the French capital are much larger\r\nthan in London, and that each floor is often the dwelling-place of a\r\nfamily. Such is generally the case in London in the poorer districts,\r\nbut in Paris it pervades almost all districts. There, some of the\r\nhouses contain 70, not fugitive but permanent, inmates. The average\r\nnumber of inhabitants to each house, according to the last census,\r\nwas upwards of _twenty-four_ (in London the average is 7·6), the\r\nextremes being eleven to each house in St. Giles’s and between five\r\nand six in the immediate suburbs (see p. 165, _ante_). Persons who are\r\ncircumstanced then, as are the Parisians, can hardly have at their\r\ncommand the proper means and appliances for a sufficient cleanliness,\r\nand for the promotion of what we consider--but the two words are\r\nunknown to the French language--the _comforts_ of a _home_.\r\n\r\n“The greater portion of the liquid refuse,” writes Mr. Rammell,\r\n“including water, which has been used in culinary or cleansing\r\nprocesses, is got rid of by means of open channels laid across the\r\ncourt-yards and the foot pavements to the street gutters, along which\r\nit flows until it falls through the nearest gully into the sewers, and\r\nultimately into the Seine. If produced in the upper part of a house,\r\nthis description of refuse is first poured into an external shoot\r\nbranching out of the rainwater pipe, with one of which every floor is\r\nusually provided. Iron pipes have been lately much introduced in place\r\nof the open channels across the foot pavements; these are laid level\r\nwith the surface, and are cast with an open slit, about one inch in\r\nwidth, at the top, to afford facility for cleansing. During the busy\r\nparts of the day there are constant streams of such fluids running\r\nthrough most of the streets of Paris, the smell arising from which is\r\nby no means agreeable. In hot weather it is the practice to turn on\r\nthe public stand pipes for an hour or two, to dilute the matter and\r\naccelerate its flow.”\r\n\r\n“With respect to fæcal refuse,” says Mr. Rammell, “and much of the\r\nhouse-slops, particularly those of bed-chambers, the _cesspool_ is\r\nuniversally adopted in Paris as the immediate receptacle.”\r\n\r\nBy far the greater proportion of the wet house-refuse of Paris,\r\ntherefore, is deposited in cesspools.\r\n\r\nI shall, then, immediately proceed to show the quantity of matter thus\r\ncollected yearly, as well as the means by which it is removed.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate _quantity_ of the cesspool matter of Paris has greatly\r\nincreased in quantity within the present century, though this might\r\nhave been expected, as well from the increase of population as from\r\nthe improved construction of cesspools (preventing leakage), and the\r\nincreased supply of water in the French metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe following figures show both the aggregate quantity and the\r\nincrease that has taken place in the cesspoolage of Paris, from 1810 to\r\nthe present time:--\r\n\r\n                              Cub. Mètres.  Cub. Feet.\r\n   In 1810 the total\r\n  quantity of refuse matter\r\n  deposited in the\r\n  basins at Montfaucon\r\n  amounted to                    50,151  =  1,770,330\r\n    In 1811 the quantity\r\n  was                            49,545  =  1,748,938\r\n    In 1812                      49,235  =  1,737,995\r\n                                 ------     ---------\r\n    Giving an average\r\n  for the three years of         49,877  =  1,760,658\r\n    The quantity at present\r\n  conveyed to Montfaucon\r\n  and Bondy\r\n  amounts, according to\r\n  M. Héloin (a very good\r\n  authority), to from 600\r\n  to 700 cubic mètres\r\n  daily, giving, in round\r\n  numbers, an annual\r\n  quantity of                   230,000  =  8,119,000\r\n\r\nThis shows an increase in 36 years of very nearly 400 per cent, but\r\nstill it constitutes little more than one-half the cesspoolage of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of refuse matter which is daily drawn from the cesspools,\r\nMr. Rammell states--and he had every assistance from the authorities\r\nin prosecuting his inquiries--at “between 600 and 700 cubic mètres;\r\n(21,180 and 24,710 cubic feet), giving, in round numbers, the annual\r\nquantity of 230,000 cubic mètres.\r\n\r\n“Dividing this annual quantity at 230,000 cubic mètres (or 8,000,000\r\ncubic feet) by the number of the population of Paris (94,721\r\nindividuals, according to the last census), we have 243 litres only as\r\nthe annual produce from each individual. The daily quantity of matter\r\n(including water necessary for cleanliness) passing from each person\r\ninto the cesspool in the better class of houses is stated to be 1-3/4\r\nlitre (3·08 pints), or 638 litres annually. The discrepancy between\r\nthese two quantities, wide as it is, must be accounted for by the fact\r\nof a large proportion of the lower orders in Paris rarely or ever using\r\nany privy at all, and by allowing for the small quantity of water made\r\nuse of in the inferior class of houses. There can be no doubt that\r\nthis latter quantity of 1-3/4 litre daily is very nearly correct, and\r\nnot above the average quantity used in houses where a moderate degree\r\nof cleanliness is observed. This proportion was ascertained to hold\r\ngood in the case of some barracks in Paris, where the contents of the\r\ncesspools were accurately measured, the total quantity divided by the\r\nnumber of men occupying the barracks, and the quotient by the number of\r\ndays since the cesspools had been last emptied; the result showing a\r\ndaily quantity of 1-3/4 litre from each individual.\r\n\r\n“The average charge per cubic mètre for extraction and transport of the\r\ncesspoolage is nine francs, giving a gross annual charge of 2,070,000\r\nfrancs (82,800_l._ sterling), which sum, it would appear, is paid every\r\nyear by the house-proprietors of Paris for the extraction of the matter\r\nfrom their cesspools, and its transport to the Voirie.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rammell says that, were a tubular system of house-drainage, such as\r\nhas been described under the proper head, adopted in Paris, in lieu of\r\nthe present mode, it would cost less than one-tenth of the expense now\r\nincurred.\r\n\r\nThe principal place of deposit for the general refuse of Paris has long\r\nbeen at Montfaucon. A French writer, M. Jules Garnier, in a recent\r\nwork, “A Visit to Montfaucon,” says:--“For more than nine hundred years\r\nMontfaucon has been devoted to this purpose. There the citizens of\r\nParis deposited their filth before the walls of the capital extended\r\nbeyond what is now the central quarter. The distance between Paris and\r\nMontfaucon was then more than a mile and a half.” Thus it appears that\r\nMontfaucon was devoted to its present purposes, of course in a much\r\nmore limited degree, as early as the reign of King Charles the Simple.\r\n\r\nThis deposit of cesspool matter is the property of the commune (as in\r\nthe city of London it would be said to belong to the “corporation”),\r\nand it is farmed out, for terms of nine years, to the highest bidders.\r\nThe amount received by the commune has greatly increased, as the\r\nfollowing returns, which are official, will show:--\r\n\r\n  A.D.                           Francs             £\r\n  1808 the cesspoolage fetched   97,000,   abt.   3,880\r\n  1817          „                75,000,    „     3,000\r\n  1834          „               165,000,    „     7,000\r\n  1843          „               525,000,    „    21,000\r\n\r\nIt is here that the “_poudrette_,”[74] of which I have spoken\r\nelsewhere, is prepared. Besides this branch of commerce, Montfaucon has\r\nestablishments for the extracting of ammonia from the cesspool matter,\r\nand the right of doing so is now farmed out for 80,000 francs a-year\r\n(3200_l_).\r\n\r\nMontfaucon is on the north side of Paris, and the place of refuse\r\ndeposit is known as the Voirie. The following account of it, and of\r\nthe manufacture of poudrette, is curious in many respects:--\r\n\r\n“The area, which is about 40 acres in extent, is divided into three\r\nirregular compartments:--\r\n\r\n“1. The system of basins.\r\n\r\n“2. The ground used for spreading and drying the matter.\r\n\r\n“3. The place where the matter is heaped up after having been dried.\r\n\r\n“The basins, standing for the most part in gradations, one above\r\nanother, by reason of the slope of the ground, are six in number. The\r\ntwo upper ones, which are upon a level, first receive the soil upon its\r\narrival at the Voirie; the four others are receptacles for the more\r\nliquid portion as it gradually flows off from the upper basins.\r\n\r\n“There is a great difference in the character of the soil brought; that\r\ntaken from the upper part of the cesspools, and amounting to a large\r\nproportion of the whole, being entirely liquid; while the remainder is\r\nmore or less solid, according to the depth at which it is taken. The\r\nwhole, however, during winter or rainy weather, is indiscriminately\r\ndeposited in the upper basins; but in dry weather, the nearly solid\r\nportion is at once thrown upon the drying-ground.”[75]\r\n\r\n“The quantity of poudrette sold in 1818 was:--\r\n\r\n  At the Voirie              50,000 setiers[76]\r\n  Sent into the departments  20,000    „\r\n                             ------\r\n    Total sale               70,000    „\r\n\r\nat prices of 7, 8, and 9 francs the setier.\r\n\r\n“This is equal, at the average price of 8 francs, to 22,400_l._\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\n“The refuse liquids, as fast as they overflow the basins, or are passed\r\nthrough the chemical works, are conducted into the public sewers, and\r\nthrough them into the Seine, nearly opposite the Jardin des Plantes.\r\n_They thus fall into the river at the very commencement of its course\r\nthrough Paris, and pollute its waters before they have reached the\r\nvarious works lower down and near the centre of the city, where they\r\nare raised and distributed for household purposes, for the supply of\r\nbaths, and for the public fountains._\r\n\r\n“Rats are found by thousands in the Voirie, and their voracity is such,\r\nthat I have often known them, during a single night, convert into\r\nskeletons the carcasses of twenty horses which had been brought thither\r\nthe evening before. The bones are burnt to heat the coppers, or to get\r\nrid of them.\r\n\r\n“Speaking of the disgusting practices at the Voirie, Mr. Gisquet\r\nsays, ‘I have seen men stark naked, passing entire days in the midst\r\nof the basins, seeking for any objects of value they might contain.\r\nI have seen others fishing for the rotten fish the market inspectors\r\nhad caused to be thrown into the basins. Two cartloads of spoilt and\r\nstinking mackerel were thrown into the largest of the basins; two hours\r\nafterwards all the fish had disappeared.’\r\n\r\n“The emanations from the Voirie are, as may well be supposed, most\r\npowerfully offensive. To a stranger unaccustomed to the atmosphere\r\nsurrounding them it would be almost impossible to make the tour of\r\nthe basins without being more or less affected with a disposition to\r\nnausea. Large and numerous bubbles of gas are seen constantly rising\r\nfrom a lake of urine and water, while evaporation of the most foul\r\ndescription is going on from many acres of surrounding ground, upon\r\nwhich the solid matter is spread to dry.”\r\n\r\nThe late M. Parent du Châtelet, a high authority on this matter, stated\r\n(in 1833) that the emanations from the Voirie were insupportable\r\nwithin a circumference of 2000 mètres (about a mile and a quarter,\r\nEnglish measure); while the winds carried them sometimes, as was shown\r\nwhen an official inquiry was made as to the ravages and causes of\r\ncholera, 2-1/2 miles; and in certain states of the atmosphere, 8 French\r\nmiles (not quite 5 English miles). The same high authority has also\r\nstated, that in addition to the emanations from the cesspool matter at\r\nthe Voirie the greater part of the carcasses of about 12,000 horses,\r\nand between 25,000 and 30,000 smaller animals, were allowed to rot upon\r\nthe ground there.\r\n\r\nTo abate this nuisance a new Voirie was, more than 20 years since,\r\nformed in the forest of Bondy, 8 miles from Paris. It consists of\r\neight basins, four on each side of the Canal de l’Ourcq, arranged\r\nlike those at Montfaucon. The area of these basins is little short of\r\n96,000 square yards, and their collective capacity upwards of 261,000\r\ncubic yards. The expectations of the relief that would be experienced\r\nfrom the establishment of the new Voirie in the forest have not been\r\nrealized. The movable cesspools only have been conveyed there, by boats\r\non the canal, to be emptied; the empty casks being conveyed back by\r\nthe same boats. The basins are not yet full; for the conveyance by the\r\nCanal de l’Ourcq is costly, and in winter its traffic is sometimes\r\nsuspended by its being frozen. In one year the cost of conveying these\r\nmovable cesspools to Bondy was little short of 1500_l._\r\n\r\nIn the latest Report on this subject (1835) the Commissioners, of whom\r\nM. Parent du Châtelet was one, recommend that all the cesspool matter\r\nat the Voiries should be disinfected. M. Salmon, after a course of\r\nchemical experiments (the Report of the Commission states), disinfected\r\nand carbonized a mass of mud and filth, containing much organic matter,\r\ndeposited (from a sewer) on the banks of the Seine.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners say, “The discovery of M. Salmon awakened the\r\nattention of the contractors of Montfaucon, who employed one of our\r\nmost skilful chemists to find for them a means of disinfection other\r\nthan that for which M. Salmon had taken out a patent. M. Sanson and\r\nsome other persons made similar researches, and from their joint\r\ninvestigations it resulted that disinfection might be equally well\r\nproduced with turf ashes, with carbonized turf, and with the simple\r\n_débris_ of this very abundant substance; and that the same success\r\nmight be obtained with saw-dust, with the refuse matter of the\r\ntan-yards, with garden mould, so abundant in the environs of Paris, and\r\nwith many other substances. A curious experiment has even shown, that\r\nafter mixing with a clayey earth a portion of fæcal matter, it was only\r\nnecessary to carbonize this mixture to obtain a perfect disinfectant\r\npowder. Theory had already indicated the result.”\r\n\r\nThis disinfection, however, has not been carried out in the Voiries,\r\nnor in the manufacture of poudrette.\r\n\r\nFrom the account of the general refuse depositories of Paris we pass to\r\nthe particular receptacles or cesspools of the French capital.\r\n\r\nThe Parisian cesspools are of two sorts:--\r\n\r\n1. Fixed or excavated cesspools.\r\n\r\n2. Movable cesspools.\r\n\r\n“In early times the _excavated cesspools_ or pits were constructed in\r\nthe rudest manner, and cleaned out more or less frequently, or utterly\r\nneglected, at the discretion of their owners. As the city increased in\r\nsize, however, and as the permeations necessarily taking place into\r\nthe soil accumulated in the lapse of centuries, the evil resulting\r\nwas found to be of grave magnitude, calling for prompt and vigorous\r\ninterference on the part of the authorities. It appears certain that\r\nprior to the year 1819 (when a strict _ordonnance_ was issued on the\r\nsubject) the cesspools were very carelessly constructed. For the\r\nmost part they were far from water-tight, and very probably were not\r\nintended to be otherwise. Consequently, nearly the whole of the fluid\r\nmatter within them drained into the springs beneath the substratum, or\r\nbecame absorbed by the surrounding soil. Nor was this the only evil:\r\nthe basement walls of the houses became saturated with the offensive\r\npermeations, and the atmosphere, more particularly in the interior of\r\nthe dwellings, tainted with their exhalations.\r\n\r\n“The _movable cesspools_, for the most part, consist simply of tanks\r\nor barrels, which, when full, are removed to some convenient spot for\r\nthe purpose of their contents being discharged. This form of cesspool,\r\nthough not leading to that contamination of the substratum which is\r\nnaturally induced by the fixed or excavated cesspool, may occasion many\r\noffensive nuisances from carelessness in overfilling, or in the process\r\nof emptying.”\r\n\r\n“The movable cesspools are of two kinds; the one,” says Mr. Rammell,\r\n“extremely simple and primitive in construction, the other more\r\ncomplicated. The former retains all the refuse, both liquid and solid,\r\npassed into it; the latter retains only the solid matter, the liquid\r\nbeing separated by a sort of strainer, and running off into another\r\nreceptacle.\r\n\r\n“The advantage of this separating apparatus is, that those cesspools\r\nprovided with it require to be emptied less frequently than the others;\r\nthe solid matter being alone retained in the movable part. The liquid\r\nportion is withdrawn from the tank into which it is received by pumping.\r\n\r\n“The other kind of movable cesspool consists simply of a wooden cask\r\nset on end, and having its top pierced to admit the soil-pipe. It\r\nis intended to retain both solid and liquid matter. When full, it\r\nis detached, and the aperture in the top having been closed by a\r\ntight-fitting lid secured by an iron bar placed across, it is removed,\r\nand an empty one immediately substituted for it.\r\n\r\n“The movable cesspool last described is much more generally used than\r\nthe other kind; very few are furnished with the separating apparatus.\r\nBut the use of either sort, I am told, is not on the increase. The\r\nmovable cesspools are found, on the whole, to be more expensive than\r\nthe fixed, besides entailing many inconveniences, one of which is the\r\nfrequent entrance of workmen upon the premises for the purpose of\r\nremoving them, which sometimes has to be done every second or third\r\nday. Moreover, if the cask becomes in the slightest degree overcharged,\r\nthere is an overflow of matter.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the movable system of cesspools (it appears from further\r\naccounts) seems to be now adopted only in those places where fixed\r\ncesspools could not be altered in accordance with the ordonnance, or\r\nwhere it is desired to avoid the first cost of a fixed cesspool.\r\n\r\nAn ordonnance of 1819 enacts peremptorily that _all_ cesspools, fixed\r\nor excavated, then existing, shall be altered in accordance with its\r\nprovisions upon the first subsequent emptying after the date of the\r\nenactment, “or if that be found impracticable, they shall be filled\r\nup.” This full delegation of power to a centralised authority was the\r\nexample prompting our late stringent enactments as to buildings and\r\nsewerage.\r\n\r\nThe French ordonnance provides also that the walls, arches, and bottoms\r\nof the cesspools, shall be constructed of a very hard description of\r\nstone, known as “pierres meulières” (mill-stone); the mortar used is\r\nto be hydraulic lime and clean river sand. Each arch is to be 30 to\r\n35 centimètres (12 to 14 inches) in thickness, and the walls 45 to 50\r\ncentimètres (18 to 20 inches); the interior height not to be less than\r\n2 mètres (2 yards 6 inches). A soil-pipe is always to be placed in the\r\nmiddle of the cesspool; its interior diameter is not to be less than\r\n9-7/8 inches in pottery-ware piping, or 7-7/8 inches in cast iron. A\r\nvent-pipe, not less than 9-7/8 inches in diameter, is to be carried up\r\nto the level of the chimney-tops, or to that of the chimneys of the\r\nadjoining houses. This is, if possible, to divert the smell from the\r\nhouse to which the cesspool is attached.\r\n\r\n“A principal object of the _ordonnance_,” it is stated in the Reports,\r\n“was to ensure the cesspools being thenceforth made water-tight;\r\nso that further pollution of the substratum and springs might be\r\nprevented; and the provisions for its attainment have been very\r\nstrictly enforced by the police. The present cesspools are, in fact,\r\nwater-tight constructions, retaining the whole of the liquids passed\r\ninto them until the same are withdrawn by artificial means. The\r\nadvantage has its attendant inconveniences, and, moreover, has been\r\ndearly paid for; for, independently of the cost of the alterations and\r\nthe increased cost of making the cesspools in the outset--the liquids\r\nno longer draining away by natural permeation--the constant expense of\r\nemptying them has enormously increased. In the better class of houses,\r\nwhere water is more freely used, the operation has now to be repeated\r\nevery three, four, or five months, whereas formerly the cesspool was\r\nemptied every eighteen months or two years. An increased water supply\r\nhas added to the evil, moderate even now as the extent of that supply\r\nis.”\r\n\r\n“It is estimated that, in the better class of houses, the daily\r\nquantity of matter, including the water necessary for cleanliness and\r\nto ensure the passage of the solids through the soil-pipe, passing\r\ninto the cesspool from each individual, amounts to 1-3/4 litre (3·08\r\nEnglish pints). Foreign substances are found in great abundance in the\r\ncesspools; the large soil-pipes permitting their easy introduction; so\r\nthat the cesspool becomes the common receptacle for a great variety\r\nof articles that it is desired secretly to get rid of. Article 19 of\r\nthe Police Regulations directs that nightmen finding any articles in\r\nthe cesspools, especially such as lead to the suspicion of a crime or\r\nmisdemeanor, shall make a declaration of the fact the same day to a\r\nCommissary of Police.”\r\n\r\nIn all such matters the police regulations of France are far more\r\nstringent and exacting than those of England.\r\n\r\n“The cesspools vary considerably in foulness,” continues the Report;\r\n“and _it is remarkable that those containing the greatest proportion of\r\nwater are the most foul and dangerous_. This is accounted for by the\r\nincreased quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen gas evolved: and is more\r\nparticularly the case where, from their large size, or from the small\r\nnumber of people using them, much time is allowed for the matter to\r\nstagnate and decompose in them. Soap-suds are said to add materially\r\nto their offensive and dangerous condition. _The_ FOULNESS _of the\r\ncesspools, therefore, would appear to be in direct proportion to the_\r\nCLEANLY _habits of the inmates of the houses to which they respectively\r\nbelong._ Where urine predominates ammoniacal vapours are given off in\r\nconsiderable quantities, and although these affect the eyes of those\r\nexposed to them--and the nightmen suffer much from inflammation of\r\nthese organs--no danger to life results. The inflammation, however, is\r\noften sufficiently acute to produce temporary blindness, and from this\r\ncause the men are at times thrown out of work for days together.”[77]\r\n\r\nThe _emptying of the cesspools_ is the next point to be considered.\r\n\r\nNo cesspool is allowed to be emptied in Paris, and no nightman’s cart,\r\ncontaining soil, is allowed to be in the streets from 8 A.M. to 10\r\nP.M. from October 1st to March 31st, nor from 6 A.M. to 11 P.M. from\r\nApril 1st to September 30th. In the winter season the hours of labour\r\npermitted by law are ten, and in the summer season seven, out of the\r\ntwenty-four; while in London the hours of night-work are limited to\r\nfive, without any distinction of season. These hours, however, only\r\nrelate to the cleansing of the fixed cesspools of Paris.\r\n\r\nFixed or excavated cesspools are emptied into carts, which are driven\r\nto the receptacles. As far as regards the removal of night-soil along\r\nthe streets, there are far more frequent complaints of stench and\r\nannoyance in Paris than in London. None of these cesspools can be\r\nemptied without authority from the police, and the police exercise\r\na vigilant supervision over the whole arrangements; neither can any\r\ncesspool, after being emptied, be closed without a written authority,\r\nafter inspection, by the Director of Health; nor can a cesspool, if\r\nfound defective when emptied, be repaired without such authority.\r\n\r\n“With regard to the movable cesspool,” it is reported, “the process of\r\nemptying is very simple, though undoubtedly demanding a considerable\r\nexpenditure of labour. The tank or barrel, when filled, is disconnected\r\nfrom the soil-pipe, an empty one being immediately substituted in its\r\nplace, and the bung-hole being securely closed, it is conveyed away\r\non a vehicle, somewhat resembling a brewer’s dray (which holds about\r\neight or ten of them), to the spot appointed as the depository of its\r\ndischarged contents. The removal of movable cesspools is allowed to\r\ntake place during the day.”\r\n\r\nIn opening a cesspool in Paris, precautions are always taken to prevent\r\naccidents which might result from the escape or ignition of the gases.\r\n\r\nThe general, not to say universal, mode of emptying the fixed or\r\nexcavated cesspools is to pump the contents into closed carts for\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n“This operation is,” says Mr. Rammell, “performed with two descriptions\r\nof pumps, one working on what may be called the _hydraulic_ principle,\r\nthe other on the _pneumatic_. In the former, the valves are placed\r\nin the pipe communicating between the cesspool and the cart, and the\r\nmatter itself is pumped. In the latter, the valves are placed beyond\r\nthe cart, and the air being pumped out of the cart, the matter flows\r\ninto it to fill up the vacuum so occasioned. The real principle is\r\nof course the same in both cases, the matter being forced up by\r\natmospheric pressure. One advantage of the pneumatic system is, that\r\nthere are no valves to impede the free passage of matter through the\r\nsuction-pipe; another, that it permits the use of a pipe of larger\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n“The cart employed for the pneumatic system consists of an iron\r\ncylinder, mounted sometimes upon four, but generally upon two wheels,\r\nthe latter arrangement being found to be the more convenient. Previous\r\nto use at the cesspool, the carts are drawn to a branch establishment,\r\nsituate just within the Barrière du Combat, where they are exhausted of\r\nair with an air-pump, worked by steam power. A 12-horse engine erected\r\nthere is capable of exhausting five carts at the same time; the vacuum\r\nproduced being equal to 28-3/8 inches (72 centimètres) of mercury. A\r\ncart (in good repair, and upon two wheels) will preserve a practical\r\nvacuum for 48 hours after exhaustion.”\r\n\r\nThe total weight of one of these carts when full is about 3 tons and 8\r\ncwt. This is somewhat more than the weight of the contents of a London\r\nwaggon employed in night-soil carriage. Three horses are attached to\r\neach cart.\r\n\r\nWhen an opening into the cesspool has been effected, a suction-pipe on\r\nthe pneumatic principle is laid from the cesspool to the cart. This\r\npipe is 3-15/16 inches in diameter, and is in separate pieces of about\r\n10 feet each, with others shorter (down even to 1 foot), to make up\r\nany exact length required. Two kinds are commonly used; one made of\r\nleather, having iron wire wound spirally inside to prevent collapse,\r\nthe other of copper. The leather pipe is used where a certain degree of\r\npliability is required; the copper for the straight parts of the line,\r\nand for determined curves; pieces struck from various radii being made\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nGutta-percha has been tried as a substitute for leather in the piping,\r\nbut was pronounced liable to split, and its use was abandoned. So with\r\nIndia-rubber in London.\r\n\r\nThe communication between the suction-pipe and the vehicle used by\r\nthe nightmen is opened by withdrawing a plug by means of a forked rod\r\ninto the “recess” (hollow) of the machine, an operation tasking the\r\nmuscular powers of two men. This done, the cesspool contents rush into\r\nthe cart, being forced up by the weight of the atmosphere to occupy the\r\nexisting vacuum; this occupies about three minutes. The cart, however,\r\nis then but three-fourths filled with matter, the remaining fourth\r\nbeing occupied by the rarefied air previously in the cart, and by the\r\nair contained in the suction-pipe. This air is next withdrawn by the\r\naction of a small air-pump, worked usually by two, but sometimes by one\r\nman. The air-pump is placed on the ground at a little distance from\r\nthe cesspool cart, and communicates with it by a flexible India-rubber\r\ntube, an inch in diameter. The air, as fast as it is pumped out, is\r\nforced through another India-rubber tube of similar dimensions, which\r\ncommunicates with a furnace, also placed on the ground at a little\r\ndistance from the air-pump, the pump occupying the middle space between\r\nthe cart and the furnace, the furnace and the pump being portable. To\r\nascertain when the vehicle is full, a short glass tube is inserted in\r\nthe end of the air-pipe (the end being of brass), and through this,\r\nwith the help of a small lantern, the matter is seen to rise.\r\n\r\n“The number of carts required for each operation,” states Mr. Rammell,\r\n“of course varies according to the size of the cesspool to be emptied;\r\nbut as these contain on the average about five cartloads, that is the\r\nnumber usually sent.[78]\r\n\r\n“In addition to the carts for the transport of the night-soil, a\r\nlight-covered spring van drawn by one horse is used to carry the tools,\r\n&c., required in the process.\r\n\r\n“These tools consist of--\r\n\r\n“1. An air-pump when the work is to be done on the pneumatic system,\r\nand of an hydraulic pump when it is to be done on the hydraulic system.\r\n\r\n“2. About 50 mètres of suction-pipe of various forms and lengths.\r\n\r\n“3. A furnace for the purpose of burning the gases.\r\n\r\n“4. Wooden hods for the removal of the solid night-soil.\r\n\r\n“5. Pails, a ladder, pincers, levers, hammers, and other articles.”\r\n\r\nI have hitherto spoken of the _Pneumatic_ System of emptying the\r\nParisian cesspools. The results of the _Hydraulic_ System are so\r\nsimilar, as regards time, &c., that only a brief notice is required.\r\nThe hydraulic pump is worked by four men; it is placed on the ground in\r\nthe place most convenient for the operation, and the cart is filled in\r\nthe space of from three to five minutes.\r\n\r\nA furnace is used.\r\n\r\n“The furnace,” says the Report, “consists of a sheet-iron cylinder,\r\nabout nine inches in diameter, pierced with small holes, and covered\r\nwith a conical cap to prevent the flame spreading. The vent-pipe first\r\ncommunicates underneath with a small reservoir, intended to contain\r\nthe matter in case the operation should be carried too far. A piece is\r\ninserted in the bottom of this reservoir, by unscrewing which it may be\r\nemptied. The furnace is sometimes fixed upon a plank, which rests upon\r\ntwo projecting pieces behind the cart.”\r\n\r\nAn indicator is also used to show the advancement of the filling of\r\nthe cart; a glass tube and a cork float are the chief portions of the\r\napparatus of the indicator.\r\n\r\n“Towards the end of the operation, when the quantity of matter\r\nremaining in the cesspool, although sufficiently fluid, is too shallow\r\nfor pumping, it is scooped into a large pail; and, the end of the\r\nsuction-pipe being introduced, drawn up into the cart. When the matter\r\nis in too solid a state to pass through the pipe, it is carried to the\r\ncart in hods, unless it is in considerable quantity. In that case it is\r\nremoved in vessels called _tinettes_, in the shape of a truncated cone,\r\nholding each about 3-1/2 cubic feet. These vessels are closed with a\r\nlid, and are lifted into an open waggon for transport.”\r\n\r\nOf these two systems the pneumatic is the more costly, and is likely to\r\nbe supplanted by the hydraulic. Each system, according to Mr. Rammell,\r\nis still a nuisance, as, in spite of every precaution, the gases\r\nescape the moment the cesspool emptying is commenced, and vitiate the\r\natmosphere. They force their way very often through the joints of the\r\npipes, and are insufficiently consumed in the furnaces. Mr. Rammell\r\nmentions his having twice, after witnessing two of these operations,\r\nsuffered from attacks of illness. On the first occasion, the men\r\nomitted to burn the foul air, and the atmosphere being heavy with\r\nmoisture, the odour was so intense that it was smelt from the Rue du\r\nPort Mahon to the Rue Menars, more than 400 yards distant.\r\n\r\nThe emptying of the cesspools is let by contract, the commune acting\r\nin the light of a proprietor. To obtain a contract, a man must have\r\nlicense or permission from the prefect of police, and such license\r\nis only granted after proof that the applicant is provided with the\r\nnecessary apparatus, carts, &c., and also with a suitable dépôt for the\r\nreception of the pumps, carts, &c., when not in use. The stock-in-trade\r\nof a contractor is inspected at least twice a-year, and if found\r\ninadequate or out of repair the license is commonly withdrawn. The\r\n“gangs” of nightmen employed by the contractors are fixed by the law\r\nat four men each (the number employed in London), but without any\r\nlegal provision on the subject. The terms of these contracts are not\r\nstated, but they appear to have ceased to be undertakings by individual\r\ncapitalists, being all in the hands of companies, known as _compagnies\r\nde vidanges_ (filth companies). There are now eight companies in\r\nParis carrying on these operations. More than half of the whole work,\r\nhowever, is accomplished by one company, the “_Compagnie Richer_.” The\r\ncapital invested in their working stock is said to exceed 4,800,000\r\nfrancs (200,000_l._). They now require the labour of 350 horses, and\r\nthe use of 120 vehicles of different descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a cesspool in Paris costs about 18_l._ as an\r\naverage. The houses containing from 30 to 70 inmates may have two, and\r\noccasionally more, cesspools. Taking the average at one and a half, the\r\ncapital sunk in a cesspool is 27_l._ Mr. Rammell says:--\r\n\r\n“Adopting these calculations of the number of cesspools to each house,\r\nand their cost, and allowing only the small quantity of 1-3/4 litre\r\n(3·08 pints) of matter to each individual, the annual expense of the\r\ncesspool system in Paris, per house containing 24 persons, will be,--\r\n\r\n“For interest, at 5 per cent upon capital sunk in works of\r\nconstruction, 1_l._ 7_s._\r\n\r\n“For extraction and removal of matter, 5_l._ 11_s._\r\n\r\n“Total, 6_l._ 18_s._\r\n\r\n“The annual expense per inhabitant will be 5_s._ 9_d._\r\n\r\n“The latter, then, may be taken as the average yearly sum per head\r\nactually paid by that portion of the inhabitants of Paris who use the\r\ncesspools.”\r\n\r\nThe following, among others before shown, are the conclusions arrived\r\nat by Mr. Rammell:--\r\n\r\n1. “That with the most perfect regulations, and the application of\r\nmachines constructed upon scientific principles, the operation of\r\nemptying cesspools is still a nuisance, not only to the inmates of the\r\nhouse to which it belongs, but to those of the neighbouring houses, and\r\nto persons passing in the street.\r\n\r\n2. “That the cesspool system of Paris presents an obstacle to the\r\nproper extension of the water supply, and consequently represses the\r\ngrowth of habits of personal and domestic cleanliness, with their\r\nimmense moral results; and that in this respect it may be said to be\r\ninconsistent with a high degree of civilization of the masses of any\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n3. “That, compared with a tubular system of refuse drainage, it is an\r\nexceedingly expensive mode of disposing of the fæcal refuse of a town.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE EMPTYING OF THE LONDON CESSPOOLS BY PUMP AND HOSE.\r\n\r\nHaving now ascertained the quantity of wet house-refuse annually\r\ndeposited in the cesspools of the metropolis, the next step is to show\r\nthe means by which these 15,000,000 cubic feet of cesspoolage are\r\nremoved, and whence they are conveyed, as well as the condition of the\r\nlabourers engaged in the business.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of removing the soil from the tanks:--\r\n\r\n1. By pump and hose, or the hydraulic method;\r\n\r\n2. By shovel and tube, or manual labour.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the new French mode, and the other the old\r\nEnglish method of performing the work. The distinctive feature between\r\nthe two is, that in the one case the refuse is discharged by means of\r\npipes into the sewers, and in the other that it is conveyed by means of\r\ncarts to some distant night-yard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF THE\r\n\r\nMODE OF CLEANSING CESSPOOLS BY PUMP AND HOSE.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the French method, therefore, the cesspoolage ultimately\r\nbecomes sewage, the refuse being deposited in a cesspool for a greater\r\nor a less space of time, and finally discharged into the sewers; so\r\nthat it is a kind of intermediate process between the cesspool system\r\nand the sewer system of defecating a town, being, as it were, a\r\ncompound of the two.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of the sewer system, as contradistinguished from\r\nthe cesspool system of defecation, is, that it admits of the wet\r\nrefuse being removed from the neighbourhood of the house as soon\r\nas it is produced; while the advantage of the cesspool system, as\r\ncontradistinguished from the sewer system, is, that it prevents the\r\ncontamination of the river whence the town draws its principal supply\r\nof water. The cesspool system of defecation remedies the main evil of\r\nthe sewer system, and the sewer system the main evil of the cesspool\r\nsystem. The French mode of emptying cesspools, however, appears to\r\nhave the peculiar property of combining the ill effects of both\r\nsystems without the advantages of either. The refuse of the house not\r\nonly remains rotting and seething for months under the noses of the\r\nhousehold, but it is ultimately--that is, after more than a year’s\r\ndecomposition--washed into the stream from which the inhabitants are\r\nsupplied with water, and so returned to them diluted in the form of\r\n_aqua pura_, for washing, cooking, or drinking. The sole benefit\r\naccruing from the French mode of nightmanship is, that it performs a\r\nnoisome operation in a comparatively cleanly manner; but surely this\r\nis a small compensation for the evils attendant upon it. The noses\r\nof those who prefer stagnant cesspools to rapid sewers cannot be so\r\nparticularly sensitive, that for the sake of avoiding the smell of\r\nthe nightman’s cart they would rather that its contents should be\r\ndischarged into the water that they use for household purposes.\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic or pump-and-hose method of emptying the cesspools is\r\nnow practised by the Court of Sewers, who introduced the process into\r\nLondon in the winter of 1847. The apparatus used in this country\r\nconsists of an hydraulic pump, which is generally placed six or eight\r\nfeet distant from, but sometimes close to, the cesspool--indeed, on\r\nits edge. It is worked by two men, “just up and down,” as one of the\r\nlabourers described it to me, “like a fire-engine.” A suction-pipe,\r\nwith an iron nozzle, is placed in the cesspool, into which is first\r\nintroduced a deodorising fluid, in the proportion, as well as can be\r\nestimated, of a pint to a square yard of matter, and diluted with water\r\nfrom the fire-plugs.\r\n\r\nThe pipes are of leather, the suction-pipes being wrapped with\r\nspring-iron wire at the joints. India-rubber pipes were used, and\r\n“answered very tidy,” one of the gangers told me, but they were too\r\nexpensive, the material being soon worn out: they were only tried\r\nfive or six months. The pipes now employed differ in no respect of\r\nsize or appearance from the leathern fire-engine pipes; and as the\r\nwork is always done in the daytime, and no smell arises from it, the\r\nneighbourhood is often alarmed, and people begin to ask where the\r\nfire is. One outsideman said, “Why, that’s always asked. I’ve been\r\nasked--ay, I dare say a hundred times in a day--‘Where’s the fire?\r\nwhere’s the fire?’” A cesspool, by this process, has been emptied into\r\na sewer at 300 yards distant. The pipe is placed within the nearest\r\ngullyhole, down which the matter is washed into the sewer. When the\r\ncesspool is emptied, it is well sluiced with water; the water is pumped\r\ninto the sewer, and then the work is complete.\r\n\r\nThe pumping is occasionally very hard work, making the shoulders and\r\nback ache grievously; indeed, some cesspools have been found so long\r\nneglected, and so choked with rags and rubbish, that manual labour had\r\nto be resorted to, and the matter dug and tubbed out, after the old\r\nmode of the nightmen. A square yard of cesspoolage is cleared out,\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, in an hour; while an average duration of\r\ntime for the cleansing of a regularly-sized cesspool is from three to\r\nfour hours.\r\n\r\nA pneumatic pump, with an iron cart, drawn by two horses (similar to\r\nthe French invention), was tried as an experiment, but discontinued in\r\na fortnight.\r\n\r\nFor the hydraulic method of emptying cesspools, a gang of four men,\r\nunder the direction of a ganger, who makes a fifth, is required.\r\n\r\nThe _division of labour_ is as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The pumpmen, who, as their name implies, work the engine or pumps.\r\n\r\n2. The holeman, who goes into the cesspool and stirs up the matter, so\r\nas to make it as fluid as possible.\r\n\r\n3. The outsideman, whose business it is to attend to the pipe, which\r\nreaches from the cesspool, along the surface of the street, or other\r\nplace, to the gullyhole.\r\n\r\n4. The ganger, who is the superintendent of the whole, and is only\r\nsometimes present at the operation; he is not unfrequently engaged,\r\nwhile one cesspool is being emptied, in making an examination or any\r\nnecessary arrangement for the opening of another. He also gives notice\r\n(acting under the instruction of the clerk of the works) to the water\r\ncompany of the district, that the pumps will be at work in this or that\r\nplace, a notice generally given a day in advance, and the water is\r\nsupplied gratuitously, from a street fire-plug, and used at discretion,\r\nsome cesspool contents requiring three times more water than others to\r\nliquefy them sufficient for pumping.\r\n\r\nThe cesspool-pumping gangs are six in number, each consisting of five\r\nmen, although the “outsideman” is sometimes a strong youth of seventeen\r\nor eighteen. The whole work is done by a contractor, who makes an\r\nagreement with the Court of Sewers, and finds the necessary apparatus,\r\nappointing his own labourers. All the present labourers, however, have\r\nbeen selected as trusty men from among the flushermen, the contractor\r\nconcurring in the recommendation of the clerk of the works, or the\r\ninspector. The cesspool-sewermen work in six districts. Two divisions\r\n(east and west) of Westminster; Finsbury and Holborn; Surrey and Kent;\r\nTower Hamlets (now including Poplar); and the City. The districts\r\nvary in size, but there is usually a gang devoted to each: in case\r\nof emergency, however, a gang from another district (as among the\r\nflushermen) is sent to expedite any pressing work. All the men are\r\npaid by the job, the payment being 2_s._ each per job, to the pumpmen\r\nand holeman, and 3_s._ to the ganger; but in addition to the 2_s._ per\r\njob, the holeman has 6_d._ a-day extra; and the outsideman has 6_d._\r\na-day _deducted_ from the 4_s._ he would earn in two jobs, which is a\r\nfrequent day’s work. The men told me that they had four or four and\r\na-half days’ work (or eight or nine jobs) every week; but such was the\r\ncase more particularly when the householders were less cognizant of\r\nthe work, and did not think of resorting to it; now, I am assured, the\r\nmen’s average employment may be put at five days a week, or ten jobs.\r\n\r\nThe perquisites of these workmen are none, except the householder sends\r\nthem some refreshment on his own accord. There may be a perquisite, but\r\nvery rarely, occurring to the holeman, should he find anything in the\r\nsoil; but the finding is far less common than among the nightmen, with\r\nwhom the process goes through different stages. I did not hear among\r\ncesspool-sewermen of anything being found by them or by their comrades;\r\nof course, when the soil is once absorbed into the pipe, it is unseen\r\non its course of deposit down the gullyhole.\r\n\r\nThe men have no trade societies, and no arrangements of any equivalent\r\nnature; no benefit clubs or sick clubs, for which their number, indeed,\r\nis too small; or, as my informant sometimes wound up in a climax, “No,\r\nnothing that way, sir.” They are sober and industrious men, chiefly\r\nmarried, and with families. Into further statistics, however, of diet,\r\nrent, &c., I need not enter, concerning so small a body; they are the\r\nsame as among other well-conducted labourers.\r\n\r\nThe men find their own dresses, which are of the same cost, form, and\r\nmaterial as I have described to pertain to the flushermen; also their\r\nown “picks” and shovels, costing respectively 2_s._ 6_d._ and 2_s._\r\n3_d._ each.\r\n\r\nOne cesspool-sewerman told me, that when he was first a member of one\r\nof those gangs he was “awful abused” by the “regular nightmen,” if he\r\ncame across any of them “as was beery, poor fellows;” but that had all\r\npassed over now.\r\n\r\nThe total sum paid to the six gangs of labourers in the course of the\r\nyear would, at the rate of ten cesspools emptied per week, amount to\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n                                       Yearly Total.\r\n  12 pumpmen, 10 jobs a-week each,\r\n  20_s._ per week, or 52_l._ per year, each     £624\r\n\r\n  6 holemen, ditto, ditto, with 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n  a-week extra                                   351\r\n\r\n  6 outsidemen, 20_s._ a-week, less by\r\n  6_d._ a-day, or 2_s._ 6_d._ a-week, 45_l._\r\n  10_s._ a-year                                  296\r\n  6 gangers, 30_s._ a-week each, or 78_l._\r\n  per year                                       468\r\n                                               -----\r\n                                               £1739\r\n\r\nAny householder, &c., who applies to the Court of Sewers, or to any\r\nofficer of the court whom he may know, has his cesspool cleansed by\r\nthe hydraulic method, in the same way as he might employ any tradesman\r\nto do any description of work proper to his calling. The charge (by\r\nthe Court of Sewers) is 5_s._ or 6_s._ per square yard, according to\r\npipeage, &c. required; a cesspool emptied by this system costs from\r\n20_s._ to 30_s._ The charges of the nightmen, who have to employ\r\nhorses, &c., are necessarily higher.\r\n\r\n  Estimating that throughout London\r\n  60 cesspools are emptied by the hydraulic\r\n  method every week, or 3120\r\n  every year, and the charge for each to\r\n  be on an average 25_s._, we have for the\r\n  gross receipts    3120 × 25_s._ =          £3900\r\n\r\n  And deducting from this the sum\r\n  paid for labour                             1739\r\n                                             -----\r\n  It shows a profit of                       £2161\r\n\r\nThis is upwards of 123 per cent; but out of this, interest on capital\r\nand wear and tear of machinery have to be paid.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1851, I am credibly informed that as many as 3000\r\nsewers were emptied by the hydraulic process; and calculating each to\r\nhave contained the average quantity of refuse, viz. five tons or loads,\r\nor about 180 cubic feet, we have an aggregate of 540,000 cubic feet of\r\ncesspoolage ultimately carried off by the sewers. This, however, is\r\nonly a twenty-seventh of the entire quantity.\r\n\r\nThe sum paid in wages to the men engaged in emptying these 3000\r\ncesspools by the hydraulic process would, at the rate of 2_s._ per man\r\nto the four members of the gang, and 3_s._ to the ganger, or 11_s._ in\r\nall for each cesspool, amount to 1650_l._, which is 139_l._ and 250\r\ncesspools less than the amount above given.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF A CESSPOOL-SEWERMAN.\r\n\r\nI give the following brief and characteristic statement, which is\r\npeculiar in showing the habitual _restlessness_ of the mere labourer.\r\nMy informant was a stout, hale-looking man, who had rarely known\r\nillness. All these sort of labourers (nightmen included) scout the\r\nnotion of the cholera attacking _them!_\r\n\r\n“Work, sir? Well, I think I _do_ know what work is, and has known it\r\nsince I was a child; and then I was set to help at the weaving. My\r\nfriends were weavers at Norwich, and 26 years ago, until steam pulled\r\nworking men down from being well paid and well off, it was a capital\r\ntrade. Why, my father could sometimes earn 3_l._ at his work as a\r\nworking weaver; there was money for ever then; now 12_s._ a-week\r\nis, I believe, the tip-top earnings of his trade. But _I didn’t like\r\nthe confinement or the close air in the factories_, and so, when I\r\ngrew big enough, I went to ground-work in the city (so he frequently\r\ncalled Norwich); I call ground-work such as digging drains and the\r\nlike. Then I ’listed into the Marines. _Oh, I hardly know what made\r\nme_; men does foolish things and don’t know why; it’s human natur.\r\nI’m sure it wasn’t the bounty of 3_l._ that tempted me, for I was\r\ndoing middling, and sometimes had night-work as well as ground-work\r\nto do. I was then sent to Sheerness and put on board the _Thunderer_\r\nman-of-war, carrying 84 guns, as a marine. She sailed through the\r\nStraits (of Gibraltar), and was three years and three months blockading\r\nthe Dardanelles, and cruising among the islands. I never saw anything\r\nlike such fortifications as at the Dardanelles; why, there was mortars\r\nthere as would throw a ton weight. No, I never heard of their having\r\nbeen fired. Yes, we sometimes got leave for a party to go ashore on\r\none of the islands. They called them Greek islands, but I fancy as\r\nhow it was Turks near the Dardanelles. O yes, the men on the islands\r\nwas civil enough to us; they never spoke to us, and we never spoke\r\nto them. The sailors sometimes, and indeed the lot of us, would have\r\nbits of larks with them, laughing at ’em and taking sights at ’em and\r\nsuch like. Why, I’ve seen a fine-dressed Turk, one of their grand\r\ngentlemen there, when a couple of sailors has each been taking a sight\r\nat him, and dancing the shuffle along with it, make each on ’em a low\r\nbow, as solemn as could be. Perhaps he thought it was a way of being\r\ncivil in our country! I’ve seen some of the head ones stuck over with\r\nso many knives, and cutlasses, and belts, and pistols, and things,\r\nthat he looked like a cutler’s shop-window. We were ordered home at\r\nlast, and after being some months in barracks, which I didn’t relish\r\nat all, were paid off at Plymouth. Oh, a barrack life’s anything but\r\npleasant, but I’ve done with it. After that I was eight years and a\r\nquarter a gentleman’s servant, coachman, or anything (in Norwich),\r\nand then got tired of that and came to London, and got to ground and\r\nnew sewer-work, and have been on the sewers above five years. Yes, I\r\nprefer the sewers to the Greek islands. I was one of the first set as\r\nworked a pump. There was a great many spectators; I dare say as there\r\nwas 40 skientific gentlemen. I’ve been on the sewers, flushing and\r\npumping, ever since. The houses we clean out, all says it’s far the\r\nbest plan, ours is. ‘Never no more nightmen,’ they say. You see, sir,\r\nour plan’s far less trouble to the people in the house, and there’s no\r\nsmell--least I never found no smell, and it’s cheap, too. In time the\r\nnightmen’ll disappear; in course they must, there’s so many new dodges\r\ncomes up, always some one of the working classes is a being ruined. If\r\nit ain’t steam, it’s something else as knocks the bread out of their\r\nmouths quite as quick.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PRESENT DISPOSAL OF THE NIGHT-SOIL.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, according to the previous calculations, that of\r\nthe 15,000,000 cubic feet of house-refuse annually deposited in the\r\ncesspools of the metropolis, about 500,000 cubic feet are pumped by the\r\nFrench process into the sewers; consequently there still remains about\r\n14,500,000 cubic feet, or about 404,000 loads, to be disposed of by\r\nother means. I shall now proceed to explain how the cesspoolage proper,\r\nthat is to say, that which is removed by cartage rather than by being\r\ndischarged into the sewers, is ultimately got rid of.\r\n\r\nUntil about twenty months ago, when the new sanitary regulations\r\nconcerning the disposal of night-soil came into operation, the cesspool\r\nmatter was “shot” in a night-yard, generally also a dust-yard.\r\nThese were the yards of the parish contractors, and were situate\r\nin Maiden-lane, Paddington, &c., &c. Any sweeper-nightman, or any\r\nnightman, was permitted by the proprietor of one of these places to\r\ndeposit his night-soil there. For this the depositor received no\r\npayment, the privilege of having “a shoot” being accounted sufficient.\r\n\r\nThere were, till within these six or eight years, I was informed,\r\n60 places where cesspool manure could be shot. These included the\r\nnightmen’s yards and the wharves of manure dealers (some of the small\r\ncoasting vessels taking it as ballast); but as regards the cesspool\r\nfilth, there are now none of these places of deposit, though some\r\nlittle, I was told, might be done by stealth.\r\n\r\nOf one of these night-yard factories Dr. Gavin gave, in 1848, the\r\nfollowing account:--\r\n\r\n“On the western side of Spitalfields workhouse, and entering from a\r\nstreet called Queen-street, is a nightman’s yard. A heap of dung and\r\nrefuse of every description, about the size of a tolerably large house,\r\nlies piled to the left of the yard; to the right is an artificial pond,\r\ninto which the contents of cesspools are thrown. The contents are\r\nallowed to desiccate in the open air; and they are frequently stirred\r\nfor that purpose. The odour which was given off when the contents were\r\nraked up, to give me an assurance that there was nothing so very bad in\r\nthe alleged nuisance, drove me from the place with the utmost speed.\r\n\r\n“On two sides of this horrid collection of excremental matter was\r\na patent manure manufactory. To the right in this yard was a large\r\naccumulation of dung, &c., but to the left there was an extensive layer\r\nof a compost of blood, ashes, and nitric acid, which gave out the most\r\nhorrid, offensive, and disgusting concentration of putrescent odours it\r\nhas ever been my lot to be the victim of. The whole place presented a\r\nmost foul and filthy aspect, and an example of the enormous outrages\r\nwhich are perpetrated in London against society.\r\n\r\n“It is a curious fact, that the parties who had charge of these two\r\npremises were each dead to the foulness of their own most pestilential\r\nnuisances. The nightman’s servant accused the premises of the manure\r\nmanufacturer as the source of perpetual foul smells, but thought his\r\nyard free from any particular cause of complaint; while the servant\r\nof the patent manure manufacturer diligently and earnestly asserted\r\nthe perfect freedom of his master’s yard from foul exhalations; but\r\nconsidered that the raking up of the drying night-soil on the other\r\nside of the wall was ‘quite awful, and enough to kill anybody.’\r\n\r\n“Immediately adjoining the patent manure manufactory is the\r\nestablishment of a bottle merchant. He complained to me in the\r\nstrongest terms of the expenses and annoyances he had been put to\r\nthrough the emanations which floated in the atmosphere having caused\r\nhis bottles to spoil the wine which was placed in such as had not been\r\n_very_ recently washed. He was compelled frequently to change his\r\nstraw, and frequently to wash his bottles, and considered that unless\r\nthe nuisance could be suppressed, he would be compelled to leave his\r\npresent premises.”\r\n\r\nThis and similar places were suppressed soon after the passing of the\r\nsanitary measures of September, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe cesspool refuse, which was disposed of for manure, was at that time\r\nfirst shot into recesses in the night-yard, where it was mixed with\r\nexhausted hops procured from the brewhouses, which were said to absorb\r\nthe liquid portions, when stirred up with the matter, and to add not\r\nonly to the consistency of the mass, but to its readier portability for\r\nland manure or for stowage in a barge. It was also mixed with littered\r\nstraw from the mews, and with stable manure generally. An old man who\r\nhad worked many years--he did not know how many--in one of these yards,\r\ntold me that when this night-soil was “fresh shot and first mixed”\r\n(with the hops, &c.), the stench was often dreadful. “How we stood it,”\r\nhe said, “I don’t know; but we did stand it.”\r\n\r\nIn one of the night-and-dust-yards, I ascertained that as many as 50\r\nloads, half of them waggon-loads, have been shot from the proprietor’s\r\nown carts, and from the carts of the nightmen “using” the yard, in one\r\nmorning, but the average “shoot” was about ten loads (half a waggon)\r\na-day for six days in the week.\r\n\r\nOf the mode of manufacture of this manure, a full account has been\r\ngiven in the details of the cesspool system of Paris, for the process\r\nwas the same in London, although on a much smaller scale; and indeed\r\nthe manufacture here was chiefly in the hands of Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nThe manure was, after it had been deposited for periods varying from\r\none month to five or six, sold to farmers and gardeners at from 4_s._\r\nto 5_s._ the cart-load, although 4_s._, I was informed, might have\r\nbeen the general average. The cesspool matter, considered _per se_,\r\nwas not worth, of late years, I am told, above 2_s._ a ton (or a load,\r\nwhich is sometimes rather more and sometimes less than a ton). It was\r\nwhen mixed that the price was 4_s._ to 5_s._ a ton. This cesspool filth\r\nwas shot on the premises of the manufacturer gratuitously, as it was in\r\nany of the night-yards. It was not until it had been kept some time,\r\nand had been mixed (generally) with other manures, and sometimes with\r\nroad-sweepings, that this manure was used in gardens; for it was said\r\nthat if this had not been done, its ammoniacal vapours would have been\r\nabsorbed and retained by the leaves of the fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nThis night-soil manure was devoted to two purposes--to the manufacture\r\nof deodorized and portable manure for exportation (chiefly to our\r\nsugar-growing colonies), and to the fertilization of the land around\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nWhen manufactured into manure it was shipped--in new casks generally,\r\nthe manure casks of the outward voyage being transformed into the brown\r\nsugar casks of the homeward-bound vessels. I was told by a seaman who\r\nsome years ago sailed to the West Indies, that these manure casks in\r\ndamp weather gave out an unpleasant odour.\r\n\r\nIt was only to the home cultivators who resided at no great distance\r\nfrom a night-yard, from five to six miles or a little more, that this\r\nmanure was sold to be carted away; their attendance at the markets\r\nwith carts, waggons, and horses, giving them facilities of conveying\r\nthe manure at a cheap rate. But upwards of three-fourths of the whole\r\nwas sent in barges into the more distant country parts, having a ready\r\nwater communication either by the Thames or by canal.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser nearer home conveyed it away in his own cart, and with\r\nhis own horses, which had perhaps come up to town laden with cabbages\r\nto Covent Garden, or hay to Cumberland-market, the cart being made\r\nwater-tight for the purpose. The “legal hours” to be observed in the\r\ncleansing of cesspools, and the transport of the contents upon such\r\ncleansing, not being required to be observed in this second transport\r\nof the cesspool manure, it was carted away at any hour, as stable dung\r\nnow is.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible at the present time, when night-yards are no longer\r\npermitted to exist in London, and the manufacture of the night-soil\r\nmanure is consequently suppressed, to ascertain the precise quantities\r\ndisposed of commercially, in a former state of things.\r\n\r\nThe money returns to the master-nightman for the manure he now collects\r\nneed no figures. The law requires him to refrain from shooting this\r\nsoil in his own yard, or in _any_ inhabited part of the metropolis, and\r\nit is shot on the nearest farm to which he has access, merely for the\r\nprivilege of shooting it, the farmer paying nothing for the deposit,\r\nwith which he does what he pleases. It is mixed with other refuse, I\r\nwas told, at present, and kept as compost, or used on the land, but the\r\nchange is too recent for the establishment of any systematic traffic in\r\nthe article.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE WORKING NIGHTMEN AND THE MODE OF WORK.\r\n\r\nNightwork, by the provisions of the Police Act, is not to be commenced\r\nbefore twelve at night, nor continued beyond five in the morning,\r\nwinter and summer alike. This regulation is known among the nightmen\r\nas the “legal hours,” and tends, in a measure, to account for the\r\nheterogeneous class of labourers who still seek nightwork; for\r\nstrong men think little of devoting a part of the night, as well\r\nas the working hours of the day, to toil. A rubbish-carter, a very\r\npowerfully-built man, told me he was partial to nightwork, and always\r\nlooked out for it, even when in daily employ, as “it was sometimes like\r\nfound money.” The scavengers, sweeps, dustmen, and labourers known as\r\nground-workers, are anxious to obtain night-work when out of regular\r\nemployment; and, ten years and more since, it was often an available\r\nand remunerative resource.\r\n\r\nNight-work is, then, essentially, and perhaps necessarily,\r\nextra-work, rather than a distinct calling followed by a separate\r\nclass of workers. The generality of nightmen are scavengers, or\r\ndustmen, or chimney-sweepers, or rubbish-carters, or pipe-layers,\r\nor ground-workers, or coal-porters, carmen or stablemen, or men\r\nworking for the market-gardeners round London--all either in or out\r\nof employment. Perhaps there is not at the present time in the whole\r\nmetropolis a working nightman who is _solely_ a working nightman.\r\n\r\nIt is almost the same with the master-nightmen. They are generally\r\nmaster-chimney-sweepers, scavengers, rubbish-carters, and builders.\r\nSome of the contractors for the public street scavengery, and the\r\nhouse-dust-bin emptying, are (or have been) among the largest employers\r\nof nightmen, but only in their individual trading capacity, for\r\nthey have no contracts with the parishes concerning the emptying\r\nof cesspools; indeed the parish or district corporations have\r\nnothing to do with the matter. I have already shown, that among the\r\nbest-patronised master-nightmen are now the Commissioners of the Court\r\nof Sewers.\r\n\r\nFor how long a period the master and working chimney-sweepers and\r\nscavengers have been the master and labouring nightmen I am unable to\r\ndiscover, but it may be reasonable to assume that this connexion, as a\r\nmatter of trade, existed in the metropolis at the commencement of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe police of Paris, as I have shown, have full control over cesspool\r\ncleansing, but the police of London are instructed merely to prevent\r\nnight-work being carried on at a later or earlier period than “the\r\nlegal hours;” still a few minutes either way are not regarded, and the\r\nlegal hours, I am told, are almost always adhered to.\r\n\r\nNightwork is carried on--and has been so carried on, within the memory\r\nof the oldest men in the trade, who had never heard their predecessors\r\nspeak of any other system--after this method:--A gang of four men\r\n(exclusive of those who have the care of the horses, and who drive\r\nthe night-carts to and from the scenes of the men’s labours at the\r\ncesspools) are set to work. The labour of the gang is divided, though\r\nnot with any individual or especial strictness, as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The _holeman_, who goes into the cesspool and fills the tub.\r\n\r\n2. The _ropeman_, who raises the tub when filled.\r\n\r\n3. The _tubmen_ (of whom there are two), who carry away the tub when\r\nraised, and empty it into the cart.\r\n\r\nThe mode of work may be thus briefly described:--Within a foot, or\r\neven less sometimes, though often as much as three feet, below the\r\nsurface of the ground (when the cesspool is away from the house) is\r\nwhat is called the “main hole.” This is the opening of the cesspool,\r\nand is covered with flag stones, removable, wholly or partially, by\r\nmeans of the pickaxe. If the cesspool be immediately under the privy,\r\nthe flooring, &c., is displaced. Should the soil be near enough to the\r\nsurface, the tub is dipped into it, drawn out, the filth scraped from\r\nits exterior with a shovel, or swept off with a besom, or washed off\r\nby water flung against it with sufficient force. This done, the tubmen\r\ninsert the pole through the handles of the tub, and bear it on their\r\nshoulders to the cart. The mode of carriage and the form of the tub\r\nhave been already shown in an illustration, which I was assured by a\r\nnightman who had seen it in a shopwindow (for he could not read), was\r\n“as nat’ral as life, tub and all.”\r\n\r\nThus far, the ropeman and the holeman generally aid in filling the tub,\r\nbut as the soil becomes lower, the vessel is let down and drawn up full\r\nby the ropeman. When the soil becomes lower still, a ladder is usually\r\nplanted inside the cesspool; the “holeman,” who is generally the\r\nstrongest person in the gang, descends, shovels the tub full, having\r\nstirred up the refuse to loosen it, and the contents, being drawn up by\r\nthe ropeman, are carried away as before described.\r\n\r\nThe labour is sometimes severe. The tub when filled, though it is never\r\nquite filled, weighs rarely less than eight stone, and sometimes more;\r\n“but that, you see, sir,” a nightman said to me, “depends on the nature\r\nof the sile.”\r\n\r\nBeer, and bread and cheese, are given to the nightmen, and frequently\r\ngin, while at their work; but as the bestowal of the spirit is\r\nvoluntary, some householders from motives of economy, or from being\r\nreal or pretended members or admirers of the total-abstinence\r\nprinciples, refuse to give any strong liquor, and in that case--if\r\nsuch a determination to withhold the drink be known beforehand--the\r\nemployers sometimes supply the men with a glass or two; and the men,\r\nwhen “nothing better can be done,” club their own money, and send to\r\nsome night-house, often at a distance, to purchase a small quantity\r\non their own account. One master-nightman said, he thought his men\r\nworked best, indeed he was sure of it, “with a drop to keep them up;”\r\nanother thought it did them neither good nor harm, “in a moderate way\r\nof taking it.” Both these informants were themselves temperate men,\r\none rarely tasting spirits. It is commonly enough said, that if the\r\nnightmen have no “allowance,” they will work neither as quickly nor\r\nas carefully as if accorded the customary gin “perquisite.” One man,\r\ncertainly a very strong active person, whose services where quickness\r\nin the work was indispensable might be valuable (and he had work as a\r\nrubbish-carter also), told me that he for one would not work for any\r\nman at nightwork if there was not a fair allowance of drink, “to keep\r\nup his strength,” and he knew others of the same mind. On my asking\r\nhim what he considered a “fair” allowance, he told me that at least a\r\nbottle of gin among the gang of four was “looked for, and mostly had,\r\nover a gentleman’s cesspool. And little enough, too,” the man said,\r\n“among four of us; what it holds if it’s public-house gin is uncertain:\r\nfor you must know, sir, that some bottles has great ‘kicks’ at their\r\nbottoms. But I should say that there’s been a bottle of gin drunk at\r\nthe clearing of every two, ay, and more than every two, out of three\r\ncesspools emptied in London; and now that I come to think on it, I\r\nshould say that’s been the case with three out of every four.”\r\n\r\nSome master-nightmen, and more especially the sweeper-nightmen, work\r\nat the cesspools themselves, although many of them are men “well to\r\ndo in the world.” One master I met with, who had the reputation of\r\nbeing “warm,” spoke of his own manual labour in shovelling filth in\r\nthe same self-complacent tone that we may imagine might be used by a\r\ngrocer, worth his “plum,” who quietly intimates that he will serve a\r\nwasherwoman with her half ounce of tea, and weigh it for her himself,\r\nas politely as he would serve a duchess; for _he_ wasn’t above his\r\nbusiness: neither was the nightman.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I went to see a gang of nightmen at work. Large horn\r\nlanterns (for the night was dark, though at intervals the stars shone\r\nbrilliantly) were placed at the edges of the cesspool. Two poles also\r\nwere temporarily fixed in the ground, to which lanterns were hung, but\r\nthis is not always the case. The work went rapidly on, with little\r\nnoise and no confusion.\r\n\r\nThe scene was peculiar enough. The artificial light, shining into the\r\ndark filthy-looking cavern or cesspool, threw the adjacent houses into\r\na deep shade. All around was perfectly still, and there was not an\r\nincident to interrupt the labour, except that at one time the window of\r\na neighbouring house was thrown up, a night-capped head was protruded,\r\nand then down was banged the sash with an impatient curse. It appeared\r\nas if a gentleman’s slumbers had been disturbed, though the nightmen\r\nlaughed and declared it was a lady’s voice! The smell, although the air\r\nwas frosty, was for some little time, perhaps ten minutes, literally\r\nsickening; after that period the chief sensation experienced was a\r\nslight headache; the unpleasantness of the odour still continuing,\r\nthough without any sickening effect. The nightmen, however, pronounced\r\nthe stench “nothing at all;” and one even declared it was refreshing!\r\n\r\nThe cesspool in this case was so situated that the cart or rather\r\nwaggon could be placed about three yards from its edge; sometimes,\r\nhowever, the soil has to be carried through a garden and through the\r\nhouse, to the excessive annoyance of the inmates. The nightmen whom I\r\nsaw evidently enjoyed a bottle of gin, which had been provided for them\r\nby the master of the house, as well as some bread and cheese, and two\r\npots of beer. When the waggon was full, two horses were brought from a\r\nstable on the premises (an arrangement which can only be occasionally\r\ncarried out) and yoked to the vehicle, which was at once driven away; a\r\nsmaller cart and one horse being used to carry off the residue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF MASTER-SWEEPS, DUST, AND OTHER CONTRACTORS,\r\nAND MASTER-BRICKLAYERS, THROUGHOUT THE METROPOLIS, ENGAGED IN\r\nNIGHT-WORK, AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF CESSPOOLS EMPTIED, AND QUANTITY OF\r\nSOIL COLLECTED YEARLY.

sufficient, by the mere range of figures, to\r\nconvey to the mind of the reader a full comprehension of the ramified\r\nvastness of the Second-Hand trade of the metropolis. Indeed tables are\r\nfor reference more than for the current information to be yielded by a\r\nhistory or a narrative.\r\n\r\nI will, therefore, offer a few explanations in elucidation, as it were,\r\nof the tabular return.\r\n\r\nI must, as indeed I have done in the accompanying remarks, depart\r\nfrom the order of the details of the table to point out, in the\r\nfirst instance, the particulars of the greatest of the Second-Hand\r\ntrades--that in Clothing. In this table the reader will find included\r\nevery indispensable article of man’s, woman’s, and child’s apparel,\r\nas well as those articles which add to the ornament or comfort of the\r\nperson of the wearer; such as boas and victorines for the use of one\r\nsex, and dressing-gowns for the use of the other. The articles used to\r\nprotect us from the rain, or the too-powerful rays of the sun, are also\r\nincluded--umbrellas and parasols. The whole of these articles exceed,\r\nwhen taken in round numbers, twelve millions and a quarter, and that\r\nreckoning the “pairs,” as in boots and shoes, &c., as but one article.\r\nThis, still pursuing the round-number system, would supply nearly\r\n_five_ articles of refuse apparel to every man, woman, and child in\r\nthis, the greatest metropolis of the world.\r\n\r\nI will put this matter in another light. There are about 35,000 Jews in\r\nEngland, nearly half of whom reside in the metropolis. 12,000, it is\r\nfurther stated on good authority, reside within the City of London. Now\r\nat one time the trade in old clothes was almost entirely in the hands\r\nof the City Jews, the others prosecuting the same calling in different\r\nparts of London having been “Wardrobe Dealers,” chiefly women, (who\r\nhad not unfrequently been the servants of the aristocracy); and even\r\nthese wardrobe dealers sold much that was worn, and (as one old\r\nclothes-dealer told me) much that was “not, for their fine customers,\r\nbecause the fashion had gone by,” to the “Old Clo” Jews, or to those\r\nto whom the street-buyers carried their stock, and who were able to\r\npurchase on a larger scale than the general itinerants. Now, supposing\r\nthat even one twelfth of these 12,000 Israelites were engaged in the\r\nold-clothes trade (which is far beyond the mark), each man would have\r\n_twelve hundred and twenty-five_ articles to dispose of yearly, all\r\nsecond-hand!\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most curious trade is that in waste paper, or as it\r\nis called by the street collectors, in “waste,” comprising every\r\nkind of used or useless periodical, and books in all tongues. I may\r\ncall the attention of my readers, by way of illustrating the extent\r\nof this business in what is proverbially refuse “waste paper,” to\r\ntheir experience of the penny postage. Three or four sheets of note\r\npaper, according to the stouter or thinner texture, and an envelope\r\nwith a seal or a glutinous and stamped fastening, will not exceed\r\nhalf-an-ounce, and is conveyed to the Orkneys and the further isles of\r\nShetland, the Hebrides, the Scilly and Channel Islands, the isles of\r\nAchill and Cape Clear, off the western and southern coasts of Ireland,\r\nor indeed to and from the most extreme points of the United Kingdom,\r\nand no matter what distance, provided the letter be posted within\r\nthe United Kingdom, for a penny. The weight of waste or refuse paper\r\nannually disposed of to the street collectors, or rather buyers, is\r\n1,397,760 lbs. Were this tonnage, as I may call it, for it comprises\r\n12,480 tons yearly, to be distributed in half-ounce letters, it would\r\nsupply material, as respects weight, for _forty-four millions, seven\r\nhundred and twenty-eight thousand, four hundred and thirty_ letters on\r\nbusiness, love, or friendship.\r\n\r\nI will next direct attention to what may be, by perhaps not\r\nover-straining a figure of speech, called “the crumbs which fall from\r\nthe rich man’s table;” or, according to the quality of the commodity of\r\nrefuse, of the tables of the _comparatively_ rich, and that down to a\r\nlow degree of the scale. These are not, however, unappropriated crumbs,\r\nto be swept away uncared for; but are objects of keen traffic and\r\nbargains between the possessors or their servants and the indefatigable\r\nstreet-folk. Among them are such things as champagne and other wine\r\nbottles, porter and ale bottles, and, including the establishments\r\nof all the rich and the comparative rich, kitchen-stuff, dripping,\r\nhog-wash, hare-skins, and tea-leaves. Lastly come the very lowest\r\ngrades of the street-folk--the _finders_; men who will quarrel, and\r\nhave been seen to quarrel, with a hungry cur for a street-found bone;\r\nnot to pick or gnaw, although Eugène Sue has seen that done in Paris;\r\nand I once, very early on a summer’s morning, saw some apparently\r\nhouseless Irish children contend with a dog and with each other for\r\nbones thrown out of a house in King William-street, City--as if after\r\na very late supper--not to pick or gnaw, I was saying, but to _sell_\r\nfor manure. Some of these finders have “seen better days;” others,\r\nin intellect, are little elevated above the animals whose bones they\r\ngather, or whose ordure (“pure”), they scrape into their baskets.\r\n\r\nI do not know that the other articles in the arrangement of the table\r\nof street refuse, &c., require any further comment. Broken metal,\r\n&c., can only be disposed of according to its quality or weight,\r\nand I have lately shown the extent of the trade in such refuse as\r\nstreet-sweepings, soot and night-soil.\r\n\r\nThe gross total, or average yearly money value, is 1,406,592_l._ for\r\nthe second-hand commodities I have described in the foregoing pages;\r\nor as something like a minimum is given, both as to the number of the\r\ngoods and the price, we may fairly put this total at a million and a\r\nhalf of pounds sterling!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSSING-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the London street-folk who earn a scanty living by\r\nsweeping crossings constitute a large class of the Metropolitan poor.\r\nWe can scarcely walk along a street of any extent, or pass through a\r\nsquare of the least pretensions to “gentility,” without meeting one or\r\nmore of these private scavengers. Crossing-sweeping seems to be one of\r\nthose occupations which are resorted to as an excuse for begging; and,\r\nindeed, as many expressed it to me, “it was the last chance left of\r\nobtaining an honest crust.”\r\n\r\nThe advantages of crossing-sweeping as a means of livelihood seem to be:\r\n\r\n1st, the smallness of the capital required in order to commence the\r\nbusiness;\r\n\r\n2ndly, the excuse the apparent occupation it affords for soliciting\r\ngratuities without being considered in the light of a street-beggar;\r\n\r\nAnd 3rdly, the benefits arising from being constantly seen in the same\r\nplace, and thus exciting the sympathy of the neighbouring householders,\r\ntill small weekly allowances or “pensions” are obtained.\r\n\r\nThe first curious point in connexion with this subject is what\r\nconstitutes the “_property_,” so to speak, in a crossing, or the\r\n_right_ to sweep a pathway across a certain thoroughfare. A nobleman,\r\nwho has been one of her Majesty’s Ministers, whilst conversing with me\r\non the subject of crossing-sweepers, expressed to me the curiosity he\r\nfelt on the subject, saying that he had noticed some of the sweepers in\r\nthe same place for years. “What were the rights of property,” he asked,\r\n“in such cases, and what constituted the title that such a man had to\r\na particular crossing? Why did not the stronger sweeper supplant the\r\nweaker? Could a man bequeath a crossing to a son, or present it to a\r\nfriend? How did he first obtain the spot?”\r\n\r\nThe answer is, that crossing-sweepers are, in a measure, under the\r\nprotection of the police. If the accommodation afforded by a well-swept\r\npathway is evident, the policeman on that district will protect the\r\noriginal sweeper of the crossing from the intrusion of a rival. I have,\r\nindeed, met with instances of men who, before taking to a crossing,\r\nhave asked for and obtained permission of the police; and one sweeper,\r\nwho gave me his statement, had even solicited the authority of the\r\ninhabitants before he applied to the inspector at the station-house.\r\n\r\nIf a crossing have been vacant for some time, another sweeper may take\r\nto it; but should the original proprietor again make his appearance,\r\nthe officer on duty will generally re-establish him. One man to whom I\r\nspoke, had fixed himself on a crossing which for years another sweeper\r\nhad kept clean on the Sunday morning only. A dispute ensued; the one\r\nclaimant pleading his long Sabbath possession, and the other his\r\ncontinuous every-day service. The quarrel was referred to the police,\r\nwho decided that he who was oftener on the ground was the rightful\r\nowner; and the option was given to the former possessor, that if he\r\nwould sweep there every day the crossing should be his.\r\n\r\nI believe there is only one crossing in London which is in the gift\r\nof a householder, and this proprietorship originated in a tradesman\r\nhaving, at his own expense, caused a paved footway to be laid down over\r\nthe Macadamized road in front of his shop, so that his customers might\r\nrun less chance of dirtying their boots when they crossed over to give\r\ntheir orders.\r\n\r\nSome bankers, however, keep a crossing-sweeper, not only to sweep a\r\nclean path for the “clients” visiting their house, but to open and shut\r\nthe doors of the carriages calling at the house.\r\n\r\nConcerning the _causes which lead or drive_ people to this occupation,\r\nthey are various. People take to crossing-sweeping either on account\r\nof their bodily afflictions, depriving them of the power of performing\r\nruder work, or because the occupation is the last resource left open\r\nto them of earning a living, and they considered even the scanty\r\nsubsistence it yields preferable to that of the workhouse. The greater\r\nproportion of crossing-sweepers are those who, from some bodily\r\ninfirmity or injury, are prevented from a more laborious mode of\r\nobtaining their living. Among the bodily infirmities the chief are old\r\nage, asthma, and rheumatism; and the injuries mostly consist of loss of\r\nlimbs. Many of the rheumatic sweepers have been bricklayers’ labourers.\r\n\r\nThe classification of crossing-sweepers is not very complex. They may\r\nbe divided into the _casual_ and the _regular_.\r\n\r\nBy the casual I mean such as pursue the occupation only on certain days\r\nin the week, as, for instance, those who make their appearance on the\r\nSunday morning, as well as the boys who, broom in hand, travel about\r\nthe streets, sweeping before the foot-passengers or stopping an hour at\r\none place, and then, if not fortunate, moving on to another.\r\n\r\nThe regular crossing-sweepers are those who have taken up their posts\r\nat the corners of streets or squares; and I have met with some who\r\nhave kept to the same spot for more than forty years.\r\n\r\nThe crossing-sweepers in the squares may be reckoned among the most\r\nfortunate of the class. With them the crossing is a kind of stand,\r\nwhere any one requiring their services knows they may be found.\r\nThese sweepers are often employed by the butlers and servants in\r\nthe neighbouring mansions for running errands, posting letters, and\r\noccasionally helping in the packing-up and removal of furniture or\r\nboxes when the family goes out of town. I have met with other sweepers\r\nwho, from being known for years to the inhabitants, have at last got\r\nto be regularly employed at some of the houses to clean knives, boots,\r\nwindows, &c.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all an unfrequent circumstance, however, for a sweeper\r\nto be in receipt of a weekly sum from some of the inhabitants in the\r\ndistrict. The crossing itself is in these cases but of little value\r\nfor chance customers, for were it not for the regular charity of the\r\nhouseholders, it would be deserted. Broken victuals and old clothes\r\nalso form part of a sweeper’s means of living; nor are the clothes\r\nalways old ones, for one or two of this class have for years been in\r\nthe habit of having new suits presented to them by the neighbours at\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\nThe irregular sweepers mostly consist of boys and girls who have\r\nformed themselves into a kind of company, and come to an agreement to\r\nwork together on the same crossings. The principal resort of these is\r\nabout Trafalgar-square, where they have seized upon some three or four\r\ncrossings, which they visit from time to time in the course of the day.\r\n\r\nOne of these gangs I found had appointed its king and captain, though\r\nthe titles were more honorary than privileged. They had framed their\r\nown laws respecting each one’s right to the money he took, and the\r\nobedience to these laws was enforced by the strength of the little\r\nfraternity.\r\n\r\nOne or two girls whom I questioned, told me that they mixed up\r\nballad-singing or lace-selling with crossing-sweeping, taking to the\r\nbroom only when the streets were wet and muddy. These children are\r\nusually sent out by their parents, and have to carry home at night\r\ntheir earnings. A few of them are orphans with a lodging-house for a\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nTaken as a class, crossing-sweepers are among the most honest of the\r\nLondon poor. They all tell you that, without a good character and “the\r\nrespect of the neighbourhood,” there is not a living to be got out of\r\nthe broom. Indeed, those whom I found best-to-do in the world were\r\nthose who had been longest at their posts.\r\n\r\nAmong them are many who have been servants until sickness or accident\r\ndeprived them of their situations, and nearly all of them have had\r\ntheir minds so subdued by affliction, that they have been tamed so as\r\nto be incapable of mischief.\r\n\r\nThe _earnings_, or rather “_takings_,” of crossing-sweepers are\r\ndifficult to estimate--generally speaking--that is, to strike the\r\naverage for the entire class. An erroneous idea prevails that\r\ncrossing-sweeping is a lucrative employment. All whom I have spoken\r\nwith agree in saying, that some thirty years back it was a good living;\r\nbut they bewail piteously the spirit of the present generation. I\r\nhave met with some who, in former days, took their 3_l._ weekly; and\r\nthere are but few I have spoken to who would not, at one period, have\r\nconsidered fifteen shillings a bad week’s work. But now “the takings”\r\nare very much reduced. The man who was known to this class as having\r\nbeen the most prosperous of all--for from one nobleman alone he\r\nreceived an allowance of seven shillings and sixpence weekly--assured\r\nme that twelve shillings a-week was the average of his present gains,\r\ntaking the year round; whilst the majority of the sweepers agree that a\r\nshilling is a good day’s earnings.\r\n\r\nA shilling a-day is the very limit of the average incomes of the\r\nLondon sweepers, and this is rather an over than an under calculation;\r\nfor, although a few of the more fortunate, who are to be found in the\r\nsquares or main thoroughfares or opposite the public buildings, may\r\nearn their twelve or fifteen shillings a-week, yet there are hundreds\r\nwho are daily to be found in the by-streets of the metropolis who\r\nassert that eightpence a-day is their average taking; and, indeed, in\r\nproof of their poverty, they refer you to the workhouse authorities,\r\nwho allow them certain quartern-loaves weekly. The old stories of\r\ndelicate suppers and stockings full of money have in the present day no\r\nfoundation of truth.\r\n\r\nThe black crossing-sweeper, who bequeathed 500_l._ to Miss Waithman,\r\nwould almost seem to be the last of the class whose earnings were above\r\nhis positive necessities.\r\n\r\nLastly, concerning the _numbers_ belonging to this large class, we may\r\nadd that it is difficult to reckon up the number of crossing-sweepers\r\nin London. There are few squares without a couple of these pathway\r\nscavengers; and in the more respectable squares, such as Cavendish or\r\nPortman, every corner has been seized upon. Again, in the principal\r\nthoroughfares, nearly every street has its crossing and attendant.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--OF THE ADULT CROSSING-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. The Able-Bodied Sweepers._\r\n\r\nThe elder portion of the London crossing-sweepers admit, as we have\r\nbefore said, of being arranged, for the sake of perspicuity, into\r\nseveral classes. I shall begin with the _Able-bodied Males_; then\r\nproceed to the _Females_ of the same class; and afterwards deal with\r\nthe _Able-bodied Irish_ (male and female), who take to the London\r\ncauseways for a living. This done, I shall then, in due order, take\r\nup the _Afflicted_ or _Crippled_ class; and finally treat of the\r\n_Juveniles_ belonging to the same calling.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE ABLE-BODIED MALE CROSSING-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\nTHE “ARISTOCRATIC” CROSSING-SWEEPER.\r\n\r\n“Billy” is the popular name of the man who for many years has swept the\r\nlong crossing that cuts off one corner of Cavendish-square, making a\r\n“short cut” from Old Cavendish-street to the Duke of Portland’s mansion.\r\n\r\nBilly is a merry, good-tempered kind of man, with a face as red as a\r\nlove-apple, and cheeks streaked with little veins.\r\n\r\nHis hair is white, and his eyes are as black and bright as a terrier’s.\r\nHe can hardly speak a sentence without finishing it off with a moist\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\nHis clothes have that peculiar look which arises from being often\r\nwet through, but still they are decent, and far above what his class\r\nusually wear. The hat is limp in the brim, from being continually\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nThe day when I saw Billy was a wet one, and he had taken refuge from a\r\nshower under the Duke of Portland’s stone gateway. His tweed coat, torn\r\nand darned, was black about the shoulders with the rain-drops, and his\r\nboots grey with mud, but, he told me, “It was no good trying to keep\r\nclean shoes such a day as that, ’cause the blacking come off in the\r\npuddles.”\r\n\r\nBilly is “well up” in the _Court Guide_. He continually stopped in his\r\nstatement to tell whom my Lord B. married, or where my Lady C. had gone\r\nto spend the summer, or what was the title of the Marquis So-and-So’s\r\neldest boy.\r\n\r\nHe was very grateful, moreover, to all who had assisted him, and\r\n_would_ stop looking up at the ceiling, and God-blessing them all with\r\na species of religious fervour.\r\n\r\nHis regret that the good old times had passed, when he made “hats full\r\nof money,” was unmistakably sincere; and when he had occasion to allude\r\nto them, he always delivered his opinion upon the late war, calling it\r\n“a-cut-and run affair,” and saying that it was “nothing at all put\r\nalongside with the old war, when the halfpence and silver coin were\r\ntwice as big and twenty times more plentiful” than during the late\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nWithout the least hesitation he furnished me with the following\r\nparticulars of his life and calling:--\r\n\r\n“I was born in London, in Cavendish-square, and (he added, laughing) I\r\nought to have a title, for I first came into the world at No. 3, which\r\nwas Lord Bessborough’s then. My mother went there to do her work, for\r\nshe chaired there, and she was took sudden and couldn’t go no further.\r\nShe couldn’t have chosen a better place, could she? You see I was born\r\nin Cavendish-square, and I’ve _worked_ in Cavendish-square--sweeping a\r\ncrossing--for now near upon fifty year.\r\n\r\n“Until I was nineteen--I’m sixty-nine now--I used to sell\r\nwater-creases, but they felled off and then I dropped it. Both mother\r\nand myself sold water-creases after my Lord Bessborough died; for\r\nwhilst he lived she wouldn’t leave him not for nothing.\r\n\r\n“We used to do uncommon well at one time; there wasn’t nobody about\r\nthen as there is now. I’ve sold flowers, too; they was very good then;\r\nthey was mostly show carnations and moss roses, and such-like, but no\r\ncommon flowers--it wouldn’t have done for me to sell common things at\r\nthe houses I used to go to.\r\n\r\n“The reason why I took to a crossing was, I had an old father and I\r\ndidn’t want him to go to the workus. I didn’t wish too to do anything\r\nbad myself, and I never would--no, sir, for I’ve got as good a\r\ncharackter as the first nobleman in the land, and that’s a fine thing,\r\nain’t it? So as water-creases had fell off till they wasn’t a living to\r\nme, I had to do summat else to help me to live.\r\n\r\n“I saw the crossing-sweepers in Westminster making a deal of money, so\r\nI thought to myself _I’ll_ do that, and I fixed upon Cavendish-square,\r\nbecause, I said to myself, I’m known there; it’s where I was born, and\r\nthere I set to work.\r\n\r\n“The very first day I was at work I took ten shillings. I never asked\r\nnobody; I only bowed my head and put my hand to my hat, and they knowed\r\nwhat it meant.\r\n\r\n“By jingo, when I took that there I thought to myself, What a fool I’ve\r\nbeen to stop at water-creases!\r\n\r\n“For the first ten year I did uncommon well. Give me the old-fashioned\r\nway; they were good times then; I like the old-fashioned way. Give\r\nme the old penny pieces, and then the eighteen-penny pieces, and the\r\nthree-shilling pieces, and the seven-shilling pieces--give me them, I\r\nsays. The day the old halfpence and silver was cried down, that is, the\r\nold coin was called in to change the currency, my hat wouldn’t hold the\r\nold silver and halfpence I was give that afternoon. I had _such_ a\r\nlot, upon my word, they broke my pocket. I didn’t know the money was\r\naltered, but a fishmonger says to me, ‘Have you got any old silver?’ I\r\nsaid ‘Yes, I’ve got a hat full;’ and then says he, ‘Take ’em down to\r\nCouttseses and change ’em.’ I went, and I was nearly squeeged to death.\r\n\r\n“That was the first time I was like to be killed, but I was nigh killed\r\nagain when Queen Caroline passed through Cavendish-square after her\r\ntrial. They took the horses out of her carriage and pulled her along.\r\nShe kept a chucking money out of the carriage, and I went and scrambled\r\nfor it, and I got five-and-twenty shillin, but my hand was a nigh\r\nsmashed through it; and, says a friend of mine, before I went, ‘Billy,’\r\nsays he, ‘don’t you go;’ and I was sorry after I did. She was a good\r\nwoman, _she_ was. The Yallers, that is, the king’s party, was agin her,\r\nand pulled up the paving-stones when her funeral passed; but the Blues\r\nwas for her.\r\n\r\n“I can remember, too, the mob at the time of the Lord Castlereagh\r\nriots. They went to Portman-square and broke all the winders in the\r\nhouse. They pulled up all the rails to purtect theirselves with. I went\r\nto the Bishop of Durham’s, and hid myself in the coal-cellar then.\r\nMy mother chaired there, too. The Bishop of Durham and Lord Harcourt\r\nopened their gates and hurrah’d the mob, so they had nothing of their’s\r\ntouched; but whether they did it through fear or not I can’t say. The\r\nmob was carrying a quartern loaf dipped in bullock’s blood, and when I\r\nsaw it I thought it was a man’s head; so that frightened me, and I run\r\noff.\r\n\r\n“I remember, too, when Lady Pembroke’s house was burnt to the ground.\r\nThat’s about eighteen year ago. It was very lucky the family wasn’t in\r\ntown. The housekeeper was a nigh killed, and they had to get her out\r\nover the stables; and when her ladyship heard she was all right, she\r\nsaid she didn’t care for the fire since the old dame was saved, for she\r\nhad lived along with the family for many years. No, bless you, sir! I\r\ndidn’t help at the fire; I’m too much of a coward to do that.\r\n\r\n“All the time the Duke of Portland was alive he used to allow me 7_s._\r\n6_d._ a-week, which was 1_s._ a-day and 1_s._ 6_d._ for Sundays. He was\r\na little short man, and a very good man he was too, for it warn’t only\r\nme as he gave money to, but to plenty others. He was the best man in\r\nEngland for that.\r\n\r\n“Lord George Bentinck, too, was a good friend to me. He was a great\r\nracer, he was, and then he turned to be member of parliament, and\r\nthen he made a good man they tell me; but he never comed over my\r\ncrossing without giving me something. He was at the corner of Holly\r\nStreet, he was, and he never put foot on my crossing without giving\r\nme a sovereign. Perhaps he wouldn’t cross more than once or twice a\r\nmonth, but when he comed my way _that_ was his money. Ah! he was a nice\r\nfeller, he was. When he give it he always put it in my hand and never\r\nlet nobody see it, and that’s the way I like to have _my_ fee give me.\r\n\r\n“There’s Mrs. D----, too, as lived at No. 6; she was a good friend of\r\nmine, and always allowed me a suit of clothes a-year; but she’s dead,\r\ngood lady, now.\r\n\r\n“Dr. C---- and his lady, they, likewise, was very kind friends of mine,\r\nand gave me every year clothes, and new shoes, and blankets, aye, and\r\na bed, too, if I had wanted it; but now they are all dead, down to the\r\ncoachman. The doctor’s old butler, Mr. K----, he gave me twenty-five\r\nshillings the day of the funeral, and, says he, ‘Bill, I’m afraid this\r\nwill be the last.’ Poor good friends they was all of them, and I did\r\nfeel cut up when I see the hearse going off.\r\n\r\n“There was another gentleman, Mr. W. T----, who lives in Harley-street;\r\nhe never come by me without giving me half-a-crown. He was a real good\r\ngentleman; but I haven’t seen him for a long time now, and perhaps he’s\r\ndead too.\r\n\r\n“All my friends is dropping off. I’m fifty-five, and they was men when\r\nI was a boy. All the good gentlemen’s gone, only the bad ones stop.\r\n\r\n“Another friend of mine is Lord B----. He always drops me a shilling\r\nwhen he come by; and, says he, ‘You don’t know me, but I knows you,\r\nBilly.’ But I _do_ know him, for my mother worked for the family many a\r\nyear, and, considering I was born in the house, I think to myself, ‘If\r\nI don’t know you, why I ought.’ He’s a handsome, stout young chap, and\r\nas nice a gentleman as any in the land.\r\n\r\n“One of the best friends I had was Prince E----, as lived there in\r\nChandos-street, the bottom house yonder. I had five sovereigns give me\r\nthe day as he was married to his beautiful wife. Don’t you remember\r\nwhat a talk there was about her diamonds, sir? They say she was kivered\r\nin ’em. He used to put his hand in his pocket and give me two or three\r\nshillings every time he crossed. He was a gentleman as was uncommon\r\nfond of the gals, sir. He’d go and talk to all the maid-servants round\r\nabout, if they was only good-looking. I used to go and ring the hairy\r\nbells for him, and tell the gals to go and meet him in Chapel-street.\r\nGod bless him! I says, he was a pleasant gentleman, and a regular good\r\n’un for a bit of fun, and always looking lively and smiling. I see he’s\r\ngot his old coachman yet, though the Prince don’t live in England at\r\npresent, but his son does, and he always gives me a half-crown when he\r\ncomes by too.\r\n\r\n“I gets a pretty fine lot of Christmas boxes, but nothing like what I\r\nhad in the old times. Prince E---- always gives me half a crown, and I\r\ngoes to the butler for it. Pretty near all my friends gives me a box,\r\nthem as knows me, and they say, ‘Here’s a Christmas box, Billy.’\r\n\r\n“Last Christmas-day I took 36_s._, and that was pretty fair; but, bless\r\nyou, in the old times I’ve had my hat full of money. I tells you again\r\nI’ve have had as much as 5_l._ in old times, all in old silver and\r\nhalfpence; that was in the old war, and not this runaway shabby affair.\r\n\r\n“Every Sunday I have sixpence regular from Lord H----, whether he’s in\r\ntown or not. I goes and fetches it. Mrs. D----, of Harley-street, she\r\ngives me a shilling every Sunday when she’s in town; and the parents\r\nas knows me give halfpence to their little girls to give me. Some\r\nof the little ladies says, ‘Here, that will do you good.’ No, it’s\r\nonly pennies (for sixpences is out of fashion); and thank God for the\r\ncoppers, though they are little.\r\n\r\n“I generally, when the people’s out of town, take about 2_s._ or 2_s._\r\n6_d._ on the Sunday. Last Sunday I only took 1_s._ 3_d._, but then, you\r\nsee, it come on to rain and I didn’t stop. When the town’s full three\r\npeople alone gives me more than that. In the season I take 5_s._ safe\r\non a Sunday, or perhaps 6_s._--for you see it’s all like a lottery.\r\n\r\n“I should like you to mention Lady Mildmay in Grosvenor-square, sir.\r\nWhenever I goes to see her--but you know I don’t go often--I’m safe for\r\n5_s._, and at Christmas I have my regular salary, a guinea. She’s a\r\nvery old lady, and I’ve knowed her for many and many years. When I goes\r\nto my lady she always comes out to speak to me at the door, and says\r\nshe, ‘Oh, ’tis Willy! and how do you do, Willy?’ and she always shakes\r\nhands with me and laughs away. Ah! she’s a good kind creetur’; there’s\r\nno pride in her whatsumever--and she never sacks her servants.\r\n\r\n“My crossing has been a good living to me and mine. It’s kept the whole\r\nof us. Ah! in the old time I dare say I’ve made as much as 3_l._ a\r\nweek reg’lar by it. Besides, I used to have lots of broken vittals,\r\nand I can tell you I know’d where to take ’em to. Ah! I’ve had as much\r\nfood as I could carry away, and reg’lar good stuff--chicken, and some\r\nthings I couldn’t guess the name of, they was so Frenchified. When\r\nthe fam’lies is in town I gets a good lot of food given me, but you\r\nknow when the nobility and gentlemen are away the servants is on board\r\nwages, and cuss them board wages, I says.\r\n\r\n“I buried my father and mother as a son ought to. Mother was\r\nseventy-three and father was sixty-five,--good round ages, ain’t they,\r\nsir? I shall never live to be that. They are lying in St. John’s Wood\r\ncemetery along with many of my brothers and sisters, which I have\r\nburied as well. I’ve only two brothers living now; and, poor fellows,\r\nthey’re not very well to do. It cost me a good bit of money. I pay\r\n2_s._ 6_d._ a-year for keeping up the graves of each of my parents,\r\nand 1_s._ 2_d._ for my brothers.\r\n\r\n“There was the Earl of Gainsborough as I should like you to mention as\r\nwell, please sir. He lived in Chandos-street, and was a particular nice\r\nman and very religious. He always gave me a shilling and a tract. Well,\r\nyou see, I _did_ often read the tract; they was all religious, and\r\nabout where your souls was to go to--very good, you know, what there\r\nwas, very good; and he used to buy ’em wholesale at a little shop,\r\ncorner of High-street, Marrabun. He was a very good, kind gentleman,\r\nand gave away such a deal of money that he got reg’lar known, and the\r\nlittle beggar girls follered him at such a rate that he was at last\r\nforced to ride about in a cab to get away from ’em. He’s many a time\r\nsaid to me, when he’s stopped to give me my shilling, ‘Billy, is any of\r\n’em a follering me?’ He was safe to give to every body as asked him,\r\nbut you see it worried his soul out--and it was a kind soul, too--to be\r\nfollered about by a mob.\r\n\r\n“When all the fam’lies is in town I has 14_s._ a-week reg’lar as\r\nclock-work from my friends as lives round the square, and when they’re\r\naway I don’t get 6_d._ a-day, and sometimes I don’t get 1_d._ a-day,\r\nand that’s less. You see some of ’em, like my Lord B----, is out eight\r\nmonths in the year; and some of ’em, such as my Lord H----, is only\r\nthree. Then Mrs. D----, she’s away three months, and she always gives\r\n1_s._ a-week reg’lar when she’s up in London.\r\n\r\n“I don’t take 4_s._ a-week on the crossing. Ah! I wish you’d give me\r\n4_s._ for what I take. No, I make up by going of errands. I runs for\r\nthe fam’lies, and the servants, and any of ’em. Sometimes they sends me\r\nto a banker’s with a cheque. Bless you! they’d trust me with anythink,\r\nif it was a hat full. I’ve had a lot of money trusted to me at times.\r\nAt one time I had as much as 83_l._ to carry for the Duke of Portland.\r\n\r\n“Aye, that was a go--_that_ was! You see the hall-porter had had it\r\ngive to him to carry to the bank, and he gets me to do it for him;\r\nbut the vallet heerd of it, so he wanted to have a bit of fun, and he\r\nwanted to put the hall-porter in a funk. I met the vallet in Holborn,\r\nand says he, ‘Bill, I want to have a lark,’ so he kept me back, and\r\nI did not get back till one o’clock. The hall-porter offered 5_l._\r\nreward for me, and sends the police; but Mr. Freebrother, Lord George’s\r\nwallet, he says, ‘I’ll make it all right, Billy.’ They sent up to my\r\npoor old people, and says father, ‘Billy wouldn’t rob anybody of a\r\nnightcap, much more 80_l._’ I met the policeman in Holborn, and says\r\nhe, ‘I want you, Billy,’ and says I, ‘All right, here I am.’ When I\r\ngot home the hall-porter, says he, ‘Oh, I am a dead man; where’s the\r\nmoney?’ and says I, ‘It’s lost.’ ‘Oh! it’s the Duke’s, not mine,’\r\nsays he. Then I pulls it out; and says the porter, ‘It’s a lark of\r\nFreebrother’s.’ So he gave me 2_l._ to make it all right. That _was_\r\na game, and the hall-porter, says he, ‘I really thought you was gone,\r\nBilly;’ but, says I, ‘If everybody carried as good a face as I do,\r\neverybody would be as honest as any in Cavendish-square.’\r\n\r\n“I had another lark at the Bishop of Durham’s. I was a cleaning the\r\nknives, and a swellmobsman, with a green-baize bag, come down the\r\nsteps, and says he to me, ‘Is Mr. Lewis, the butler, in?’--he’d got\r\nthe name off quite pat. ‘No,’ says I, ‘he’s up-stairs;’ then says he,\r\n‘Can I step into the pantry?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ says I, and shows him in.\r\nBless you! he was so well-dressed, I thought he was a master-shoemaker\r\nor something; but as all the plate was there, thinks I, I’ll just lock\r\nthe door to make safe. So I fastens him in tight, and keeps him there\r\ntill Mr. Lewis comes. No, he didn’t take none of the plate, for Mr.\r\nLewis come down, and then, as he didn’t know nothink about him, we had\r\nin a policeman, when we finds his bag was stuffed with silver tea-pots\r\nand all sorts of things from my Lord Musgrave’s. Says Mr. Lewis, ‘You\r\ndid quite right, Billy.’ It wasn’t a likely thing I was going to let\r\nanybody into a pantry crammed with silver.\r\n\r\n“There was another chap who had prigged a lot of plate. He was an\r\nold man, and had a bag crammed with silver, and was a cutting away,\r\nwith lots of people after him. So I puts my broom across his legs and\r\ntumbles him, and when he got up he cut away and left the bag. Ah! I’ve\r\nseen a good many games in my time--that I have. The butler of the house\r\nthe plate had been stole from give me 2_l._ for doing him that turn.\r\n\r\n“Once a gentleman called me, and says he, ‘My man, how long have you\r\nbeen in this square?’ Says I, ‘I’m Billy, and been here a’most all my\r\nlife.’ Then he says, ‘Can I trust you to take a cheque to Scott, the\r\nbanker?’ and I answers, ‘That’s as you like,’ for I wasn’t going to\r\npress him. It was a heavy cheque, for Mr. Scott, as knows me well--aye,\r\nwell, he do--says ‘Billy, I can’t give you all in notes, you must stop\r\na bit.’ It nearly filled the bag I had with me. I took it all safe\r\nback, and says he, ‘Ah! I knowed it would be all right,’ and he give me\r\na half-sovereign. I should like you to put these things down, ’cos it’s\r\na fine thing for my charackter, and I can show my face with any man for\r\nbeing honest, that’s one good thing.\r\n\r\n“I pays 4_s._ a-week for two rooms, one up and one down, for I couldn’t\r\nlive in one room. I come to work always near eight o’clock, for you see\r\nit takes me some time to clean the knives and boots at Lord B----’s. I\r\nget sometimes 1_s._ and sometimes 1_s._ 6_d._ a-week for doing that,\r\nand glad I am to have it. It’s only for the servants I does it, not for\r\nthe quality.\r\n\r\n“When I does anythink for the servants, it’s either cleaning boots and\r\nknives, or putting letters in the post--that’s it--anythink of that\r\nkind. They gives me just what they can, 1_d._ or 2_d._ or half a pint\r\nof beer when they ha’n’t got any coppers.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I gets a few left-off clothes, but very seldom. I have two\r\nsuits a-year give me reg’lar, and I goes to a first-rate tailor for\r\n’em, though they don’t make the prime--of course not, yet they’re very\r\ngood. Now this coat I liked very well when it was new, it was so clean\r\nand tidy. No, the tailor don’t show me the pattern-books and that sort\r\nof thing: he knows what’s wanted. I won’t never have none of them\r\nwashing duck breeches; that’s the only thing as I refuses, and the\r\ntailor knows that. I looks very nice after Christmas, I can tell you,\r\nand I’ve always got a good tidy suit for Sundays, and God bless them as\r\ngives ’em to me.\r\n\r\n“Every Sunday I gets a hot dinner at Lord B----’s, whether he’s out of\r\ntown or in town--that’s summat. I gets bits, too, give me, so that I\r\ndon’t buy a dinner, no, not once a-week. I pays 4_s._ a-week rent, and\r\nI dare say my food, morning and night, costs me a 1_s._ a-day--aye, I’m\r\nsure it does, morning and night. At present I don’t make 12_s._ a-week;\r\nbut take the year round, one week with another, it might come to 13_s._\r\nor 14_s._ a-week I gets. Yes, I’ll own to that.\r\n\r\n“Christmas is my best time; then I gets more than 1_l._ a-week: now I\r\ndon’t take 4_s._ a-week on my crossing. Many’s the time I’ve made my\r\nbreakfast on a pen’orth of coffee and a halfpenny slice of bread and\r\nbutter. What do you think of that?\r\n\r\n“Wet weather does all the harm to me. People, you see, don’t like to\r\ncome out. I think I’ve got the best side of the square, and you see my\r\ncrossing is a long one, and saves people a deal of ground, for it cuts\r\noff the corner. It used to be a famous crossing in its time--hah! but\r\nthat’s gone.\r\n\r\n“I always uses what they calls the brush-brooms; that’s them with a\r\nflat head like a house-broom. I can’t abide them others; they don’t\r\nlook well, and they wears out ten times as quick as mine. I general\r\nbuys the eights, that’s 10_d._ a-piece, and finds my own handles. A\r\nbroom won’t last me more than a fortnight, it’s such a long crossing;\r\nbut when it was paved, afore this muckydam (macadamising) was turned\r\nup, a broom would last me a full three months. I can’t abide this\r\nmuckydam--can you, sir? it’s sloppy stuff, and goes so bad in holes.\r\nGive me the good solid stones as used to be.\r\n\r\n“I does a good business round the square when the snow’s on the ground.\r\nI general does each house at so much a-week whilst it snows. Hardwicks\r\ngive me a shilling. I does only my side, and that next Oxford-street. I\r\ndon’t go to the others, unless somebody comes and orders me--for fair\r\nplay _is_ fair play--and they belongs to the other sweepers. I does\r\nmy part and they does theirs.\r\n\r\n“It’s seldom as I has a shop to sweep out, and I don’t do nothink with\r\nshutters. I’m getting too old now for to be called in to carry boxes up\r\ngentlemen’s houses, but when I was young I found plenty to do that way.\r\nThere’s a man at the corner of Chandos-street, and he does the most of\r\nthat kind of work.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEARDED CROSSING-SWEEPER AT THE EXCHANGE.\r\n\r\nSince the destruction by fire of the Royal Exchange in 1838, there\r\nhas been added to the curiosities of Cornhill a thickset, sturdy, and\r\nhirsute crossing-sweeper--a man who is as civil by habit as he is\r\nindependent by nature. He has a long flowing beard, grey as wood smoke,\r\nand a pair of fierce moustaches, giving a patriarchal air of importance\r\nto a marked and observant face, which often serves as a painter’s\r\nmodel. After half-an-hour’s conversation, you are forced to admit that\r\nhis looks do not all belie him, and that the old mariner (for such was\r\nhis profession formerly) is worthy in some measure of his beard.\r\n\r\nHe wears an old felt hat--very battered and discoloured; around his\r\nneck, which is bared in accordance with sailor custom, he has a thick\r\nblue cotton neckerchief tied in a sailor’s knot; his long iron-grey\r\nbeard is accompanied by a healthy and almost ruddy face. He stands\r\nagainst the post all day, saying nothing, and taking what he can get\r\nwithout solicitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEARDED CROSSING-SWEEPER AT THE EXCHANGE.\r\n\r\n[_From a Photograph._]]\r\n\r\nWhen I first spoke to him, he wanted to know to what purpose I intended\r\napplying the information that he was prepared to afford, and it was\r\nnot until I agreed to walk with him as far as St. Mary-Axe that I was\r\nenabled to obtain his statement, as follows:--\r\n\r\n“I’ve had this crossing ever since ’38. The Exchange was burnt down\r\nin that year. Why, sir, I was wandering about trying to get a crust,\r\nand it was very sloppy, so I took and got a broom; and while I kept a\r\nclean crossing, I used to get ha’pence and pence. I got a dockman’s\r\nwages--that’s half-a-crown a-day; sometimes only a shilling, and\r\nsometimes more. I have taken a crown--but that’s very rare. The best\r\ncustomers I had is dead. I used to make a good Christmas, but I don’t\r\nnow. I have taken a pound or thirty shillings then in the old times.\r\n\r\n“I smoke, sir; I _will_ have tobacco, if I can’t get grub. My old woman\r\ntakes cares that I have tobacco.\r\n\r\n“I have been a sailor, and the first ship as ever I was in was the Old\r\nColossus, 74, but we was only cruising about the Channel then, and took\r\ntwo prizes. I went aboard the Old Remewa guardship--we were turned over\r\nto her--and from her I was drafted over to the Escramander frigate. We\r\nwent out chasing Boney, but he gived himself up to the Old Impregnable.\r\nI was at the taking of Algiers, in 1816, in the Superb. I was in the\r\nRochfort, 74, up the Mediterranean (they call it up the Mediterranean,\r\nbut it was the Malta station) three years, ten months, and twenty days,\r\nuntil the ship was paid off.\r\n\r\n“Then I went to work at the Dockyard. I had a misfortune soon after\r\nthat. I fell out of a garret window, three stories high, and that kept\r\nme from going to the Docks again. I lost all my top teeth by that fall.\r\nI’ve got a scar here, one on my chin; but I warn’t in the hospital more\r\nthan two weeks.\r\n\r\n“I was afeard of being taken up solicitin’ charity, and I knew that\r\nsweeping was a safe game; they couldn’t take me up for sweeping a\r\ncrossing.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I get insulted, only in words; sometimes I get chaffed by\r\nsober people. Drunken men I don’t care for; I never listen to ’em,\r\nunless they handle me, and then, although I am sixty-three this very\r\nday, sir, I think I could show them something. I _do_ carry my age\r\nwell; and if you could ha’ seen how I have lived this last winter\r\nthrough, sometimes one pound of bread between two of us, you’d say I\r\nwas a strong man to be as I am.\r\n\r\n“Those who think that sweepin’ a crossing is idle work, make a great\r\nmistake. In wet weather, the traffic that makes it gets sloppy as\r\nsoon as it’s cleaned. Cabs, and ’busses, and carriages continually\r\ngoing over the crossing must scatter the mud on it, and you must look\r\nprecious sharp to keep it clean; but when I once get in the road, I\r\nnever jump out of it. I keeps my eye both ways, and if I gets in too\r\nclose quarters, I slips round the wheels. I’ve had them almost touch me.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, I never got knocked down. In foggy weather, of course, it’s\r\nno use sweeping at all.\r\n\r\n“Parcels! it’s very few parcels I get to carry now; I don’t think I\r\nget a parcel to carry once in a month: there’s ’busses and railways so\r\ncheap. A man would charge as much for a distance as a cab would take\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“I don’t come to the same crossing on Sundays; I go to the corner of\r\nFinch-lane. As to regular customers, I’ve none--to say regular; some\r\ngive me sixpence now and then. All those who used to give me regular\r\nare dead.\r\n\r\n“I was a-bed when the Exchange was burnt down.\r\n\r\n“I have had this beard five years. I grew it to sit to artists when I\r\ngot the chance; but it don’t pay expenses--for I have to walk four or\r\nfive miles, and only get a shilling an hour: besides, I’m often kept\r\nnearly two hours, and I get nothing for going and nothing for coming,\r\nbut just for the time I am there.\r\n\r\n“Afore I wore it, I had a pair of large whiskers. I went to a\r\ngentleman then, an artist, and he _did_ pay me well. He advised me to\r\ngrow mustarshers and the beard, but he hasn’t employed me since.\r\n\r\n“They call me ‘Old Jack’ on the crossing, that’s all they call me. I\r\nget more chaff from the boys than any one else. They only say, ‘Why\r\ndon’t you get shaved?’ but I take no notice on ’em.\r\n\r\n“Old Bill, in Lombard Street! I knows him; he used to make a good thing\r\nof it, but I don’t think he makes much now.\r\n\r\n“My wife--I am married, sir--doesn’t do anything. I live in a\r\nlodging-house, and I pay three shillings a-week.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what we has, now, when I go home. We has a pound of bread,\r\na quarter of an ounce of tea, and perhaps a red herring.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had a weakness in my legs for two year; the veins comes down, but\r\nI keep a bandage in my pocket, and when I feels ’em coming down, I puts\r\nthe bandage on ’till the veins goes up again--it’s through being on my\r\nlegs so long (because I had very strong legs when young) and want of\r\ngood food. When you only have a bit of bread and a cup of tea--no meat,\r\nno vegetables--you find it out; but I’m as upright as a dart, and as\r\nlissom as ever I was.\r\n\r\n“I gives threepence for my brooms. I wears out three in a week in the\r\nwet weather. I always lean very hard on my broom, ’specially when\r\nthe mud is sticky--as it is after the roads is watered. I am very\r\nparticular about my brooms; I gives ’em away to be burned when many\r\nanother would use them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWEEPER IN PORTMAN SQUARE, WHO GOT PERMISSION FROM THE POLICE.\r\n\r\nA wild-looking man, with long straggling grey hair, which stood out\r\nfrom his head as if he brushed it the wrong way; and whiskers so thick\r\nand curling that they reminded one of the wool round a sheep’s face,\r\ngave me the accompanying history.\r\n\r\nHe was very fond of making use of the term “honest crust,” and each\r\ntime he did so, he, Irish-like, pronounced it “currust.” He seemed a\r\nkind-hearted, innocent creature, half scared by want and old age.\r\n\r\n“I’m blest if I can tell which is the best crossing in London; but\r\nmine ain’t no great shakes, for I don’t take three shilling a-week not\r\nwith persons going across, take one week with another, but I thought\r\nI could get a honest currust (crust) at it, for I’ve got a crippled\r\nhand, which comed of its own accord, and I was in St. George’s Hospital\r\nseven weeks. When I comed out it was a cripple with me, and I thought\r\nthe crossing was better than going into the workhouse--for I likes my\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been on this crossing since last Christmas was a twelvemonth.\r\nBefore that I was a bricklayer and plasterer. I’ve been thirty-two\r\nyears in London. I can get as good a character as any one anywhere,\r\nplease God; for as to drunkards, and all that, I was none of them. I\r\nwas earning eighteen shilling a-week, and sometimes with my overtime\r\nI’ve had twenty shilling, or even twenty-three shilling. Bricklayers is\r\npaid according to all the hours they works beyond ten, for that’s the\r\nbricklayer’s day.\r\n\r\n“I was among the lime, and the sand, and the bricks, and then my hand\r\ncome like this (he held out a hand with all the fingers drawn up\r\ntowards the middle, like the claw of a dead bird). All the sinews have\r\ngone, as you see yourself, sir, so that I can’t bend it or straighten\r\nit, for the fingers are like bits of stick, and you can’t bend ’em\r\nwithout breaking them.\r\n\r\n“When I couldn’t lay hold of anything, nor lift it up, I showed it to\r\nmaster, and he sent me to his doctor, who gived me something to rub\r\nover it, for it was swelled up like, and then I went to St. George’s\r\nHospital, and they cut it over, and asked me if I could come in doors\r\nas in-door patient? and I said Yes, for I wanted to get it over sooner,\r\nand go back to my work, and earn an honest currust. Then they scarred\r\nit again, cut it seven times, and I was there many long weeks; and\r\nwhen I comed out I could not hold any tool, so I was forced to keep\r\non pawning and pledging to keep an honest currust in my mouth, and\r\nsometimes I’d only just be with a morsel to eat, and sometimes I’d be\r\nhungry, and that’s the truth.\r\n\r\n“What put me up to crossing-sweeping was this--I had no other thing\r\nopen to me but the workhouse; but of course I’d sooner be out on my\r\nliberty, though I was entitled to go into the house, of course, but I’d\r\nsooner keep out of it if I could earn an honest currust.\r\n\r\n“One of my neighbours persuaded me that I should pick up a good currust\r\nat a crossing. The man who had been on my crossing was gone dead, and\r\nas it was empty, I went down to the police-office, in Marylebone Lane,\r\nand they told me I might take it, and give me liberty to stop. I was\r\ntold the man who had been there before me had been on it fourteen\r\nyears, and them was good times for gentle and simple and all--and it\r\nwas reported that this man had made a good bit of money, at least so it\r\nwas said.\r\n\r\n“I thought I could make a living out of it, or an honest currust, but\r\nit’s a very poor living, I can assure you. When I went to it first, I\r\ndone pretty fair for a currust; but it’s only three shillings to me\r\nnow. My missus has such bad health, or she used to help me with her\r\nneedle. I can assure you, sir, it’s only one day a week as I have a bit\r\nof dinner, and I often go without breakfast and supper, too.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t got any regular customers that allow me anything. When the\r\nfamilies is in town sometimes they give me half-a-crown, or sixpence,\r\nnow and then, perhaps once a fortnight, or a month. They’ve got footmen\r\nand servant-maids, so they never wants no parcels taken--they make\r\n_them_ do it; but sometimes I get a penny for posting a letter from one\r\nof the maids, or something like that.\r\n\r\n“The best day for us is Sunday. Sometimes I get a shilling, and when\r\nthe families is in town eighteen pence. But when the families is away,\r\nand the weather so fine there’s no mud, and only working-people going\r\nto the chapels, they never looks at me, and then I’ll only get a\r\nshilling.”\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER WHO GOT PERMISSION TO SWEEP.\r\n\r\nAn old Irishman, who comes from Cork, was spoken of to us as a\r\ncrossing-sweeper who had formally obtained permission before exercising\r\nhis calling; but I found, upon questioning him, that it was but little\r\nmore than a true Hibernian piece of conciliation on his part; and,\r\nindeed, that out of fear of competition, he had asked leave of the\r\nservants and policeman in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIt seems somewhat curious, as illustrative of the rights of property\r\namong crossing-sweepers, that three or four “intending” sweepers, when\r\nthey found themselves forestalled by the old man in question, had no\r\nidea of supplanting the Irishman, and merely remarked,--\r\n\r\n“Well, you’re lucky to get it so soon, for we meant to take it.”\r\n\r\nIn reply to our questions, the man said,--\r\n\r\n“I came here in January last: I knew the old man was did who used to\r\nkeep the crossin’, and I thought I would like the kind of worruk, for\r\nI am getting blind, and hard of hearing likewise. I’ve got no parish;\r\nsince the passing of the last Act, I’ve niver lived long enough in any\r\none parish for that. I applied to Marabone, and they offered to sind me\r\nback to Ireland, but I’d got no one to go to, no friends or relations,\r\nor if I have, they’re as poor there as I am mysilf, sir.\r\n\r\n“There was an ould man here before me. He used to have a stool to rest\r\nhimsilf on, and whin he died, last Christmas, a man as knew him and me\r\nasked me whither I would take it or no, and I said I would. His broom\r\nand stool were in the coal-cellar at this corner house, Mr. ----’s,\r\nwhere he used to leave them at night times, and they gave them up to\r\nme; but I didn’t use the stool, sir, it might be an obsthruction to the\r\npassers-by; and, sir, it looks as if it was infirrumity. But, plaise\r\nthe Lord, I’ll git and make a stool for myself against the hard winter,\r\nI will, bein’ a carpenter by thrade.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t ask the gintlefolks’ permission to come here, but I asked\r\nthe police and the servants, and such as that. I asked the servants at\r\nthe corner-house. I don’t know whither they could have kept me away\r\nif I had not asked. Soon after I came here the gintlefolks--some of\r\nthem--stopped and spoke to me. ‘So,’ says they, ‘you’ve taken the place\r\nof the old man that’s did?’ ‘Yes, I have,’ says I. ‘Very will,’ says\r\nthey, and they give me a ha’penny. That was all that occurred upon my\r\ntakin’ to the crossin’.\r\n\r\n“But there were some others who would have taken it if I had not; they\r\ntould me I was lucky in gettin’ it so soon, or they would have had it,\r\nbut I don’t know who they are.\r\n\r\n“I am seventy-three years ould the 2d of June last. My wife is about\r\nthe same age, and very much afflicted with the rheumatis, and she\r\ninjured hersilf, too, years ago, by fallin’ off a chair while she was\r\ntakin’ some clothes off the line.\r\n\r\n“Not to desave you, sir, I get a shillin’ a-week from one of my childer\r\nand ninepence from another, and a little hilp from some of the others.\r\nI have siven childer livin’, and have had tin. They are very much\r\nscattered: two are abroad; one is in the tinth Hussars--he is kind to\r\nme. The one who allows me ninepence is a basket-maker at Reading; and\r\nthe shillin’ I get from my daughter, a servant, sir. One of my sons\r\ndied in the Crimmy; he was in the 13th Light Dragoons, and died at\r\nScutari, on the 25th of May. They could not hilp me more than they thry\r\nto do, sir.\r\n\r\n“I only make about two shilling a-week here, sir; and sometimes I\r\ndon’t take three ha’pence a day. On Sundays I take about sivenpence,\r\nninepence, or tinpence, ’cordin’ as I see the people who give rigular.\r\n\r\n“Weather makes no difference to me--for, though the sum is small, I am\r\na rigular pinsioner like of theirs. I go to Somer’s-town Chapel, being\r\na Catholic, for I’m not ashamed to own my religion before any man. When\r\nI go, it is at siven in the evening. Sometimes I go to St. Pathrick’s\r\nChapel, Soho-square. I have not been to confission for two or three\r\nyears--the last time was to Mr. Stanton, at St. Pathrick’s.\r\n\r\n“There’s a poor woman, sir, who goes past here every Friday to get her\r\npay from the parish, and, as sure as she comes back again, she gives me\r\na ha’penny--she does, indeed. Sometimes the baker or the greengrocer\r\ngives me a ha’penny for minding their baskets.\r\n\r\n“I’m perfectly satisfied; it’s no use to grumble, and I might be worrus\r\noff, sir. Yes, I go of arrinds some times; fitch water now and then,\r\nand post letters; but I do no odd jobs, such as hilping the servants\r\nto clean the knives, or such-like. No: they wouldn’t let me behint the\r\nshadow of their doors.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA THIRD WHO ASKED LEAVE.\r\n\r\nThis one was a mild and rather intelligent man, in a well worn black\r\ndress-coat and waistcoat, a pair of “moleskin” trousers, and a\r\nblue-and-white cotton neckerchief. I found him sweeping the crossing at\r\nthe end of ---- place, opposite the church.\r\n\r\nHe every now and then regaled himself with a pinch of snuff, which\r\nseemed to light up his careworn face. He seemed very willing to afford\r\nme information. He said:--\r\n\r\n“I have been on this crossing four years. I am a bricklayer by trade;\r\nbut you see how my fingers have gone: it’s all rheumatics, sir. I took\r\na great many colds. I had a great deal of underground work, and that\r\ntries a man very much.\r\n\r\n“How did I get the crossing? Well, I took it--I came as a cas’alty.\r\nNo one ever interfered with me. If one man leaves a crossing, well,\r\nanother takes it.\r\n\r\n“Yes, some crossings is worth a good deal of money. There was a black\r\nin Regent-street, at the corner of Conduit-street, I think, who had two\r\nor three houses--at least, I’ve heard so; and I know for a certainty\r\nthat the man in Cavendish-square used to get so much a week from\r\nthe Duke of Portland--he got a shilling a-day, and eighteenpence on\r\nSundays. I don’t know why he got more on Sundays. I don’t know whether\r\nhe gets it since the old Duke’s death.\r\n\r\n“The boys worry me. I mean the little boys with brooms; they are an\r\nabusive set, and give me a good deal of annoyance; they are so very\r\ncheeky; they watch the police away; but if they see the police coming,\r\nthey bolt like a shot. There are a great many Irish lads among them.\r\nThere were not nearly so many boys about a few years ago.\r\n\r\n“I once made eighteenpence in one day, that was the best day I ever\r\nmade: it was very bad weather: but, take the year through, I don’t make\r\nmore than sixpence a-day.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t worked at bricklaying for a matter of six year. What did I\r\ndo for the two years before I took to crossing-sweeping? Why, sir, I\r\nhad saved a little money, and managed to get on somehow. Yes, I have\r\nhad my troubles, but I never had what I call great ones, excepting my\r\nwife’s blindness. She was blind, sir, for eleven year, and so I had to\r\nfight for everything: she has been dead two year, come September.\r\n\r\n“I have seven children, five boys and two girls; they are all grown up\r\nand got families. Yes, they ought, amongst them, to do something for\r\nme; but if you have to trust to children, you will soon find out what\r\n_that_ is. If they want anything of you, they know where to find you;\r\nbut if you want anything of them, it’s no go.\r\n\r\n“I think I made more money when first I swept this crossing than I do\r\nnow; it’s not a _good_ crossing, sir. Oh, no; but it’s handy home, you\r\nsee. When a shower of rain comes on, I can run home, and needn’t go\r\ninto a public-house; but it’s a poor neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, indeed sir, I am always here. Certainly; I am laid up\r\nsometimes for a day with my feet. I am subject to the rheumatic gout,\r\nyou see. Well, I don’t know whether so much standing has anything to do\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, I _have_ heard of what you call ‘shutting-up shop.’ I\r\nnever heard it called by that name before, though; but there’s lots\r\nof sweepers as sweep back the dirt before leaving at night. I know\r\nthey do, some of them. I never did it myself--I don’t care about it; I\r\nalways think there’s the trouble of sweeping it back in the morning.\r\n\r\n“People liberal? No, sir, I don’t think there are many liberal people\r\nabout; if people were liberal I should make a good deal of money.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, after I get home, I read a book, if I can borrow one. What\r\ndo I read? Well, novels, when I can get them. What did I read last\r\nnight? Well, _Reynolds’s Miscellany_; before that I read the _Pilgrim’s\r\nProgress_. I have read it three times over; but there’s always\r\nsomething new in it.\r\n\r\n“Well, weather makes very little difference in this neighbourhood.\r\nMy rent is two-and-sixpence a-week. I have a little relief from the\r\nparish. How much? Two-and-sixpence. How much does my living cost? Well,\r\nI am forced to live on what I can get. I manage as well as I can; if I\r\nhave a good week, I spend it--I get more nourishment then, that’s all.\r\n\r\n“I used to smoke, sir, a great deal, but I haven’t touched a pipe for a\r\nmatter of forty year. Yes, sir, I take snuff, Scotch and Rappee, mixed.\r\nIf I go without a meal of victuals, I must have my snuff. I take an\r\nounce a-week, sir; it costs fourpence--that there is the only luxury I\r\nget, unless somebody gives me a half pint of beer.\r\n\r\n“I very rarely get an odd job, this is not the neighbourhood for them\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, I go to church on Sunday; I go to All Souls’, in\r\nLangham-place, the church with the sharp spire. I go in the morning;\r\nonce a day is quite enough for me. In the afternoon, I generally take a\r\nwalk in the Park, or I go to see one of my young ones; they won’t come\r\nto the old crossing-sweeper, so I go to them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA REGENT-STREET CROSSING-SWEEPER.\r\n\r\nA man who had stationed himself at the end of Regent-street, near the\r\nCounty Fire Office, gave me the following particulars.\r\n\r\nHe was a man far superior to the ordinary run of sweepers, and, as will\r\nbe seen, had formerly been a gentleman’s servant. His costume was of\r\nthat peculiar miscellaneous description which showed that it had from\r\ntime to time been given to him in charity. A dress-coat so marvellously\r\ntight that the stitches were stretching open, a waistcoat with a\r\nremnant of embroidery, and a pair of trousers which wrinkled like a\r\ngroom’s top-boot, had all evidently been part of the wardrobe of the\r\ngentlemen whose errands he had run. His boots were the most curious\r\nportion of his toilette, for they were large enough for a fisherman,\r\nand the portion unoccupied by the foot had gone flat and turned up like\r\na Turkish slipper.\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a tone and manner which showed some education. Once or\r\ntwice whilst I was listening to his statement he insisted upon removing\r\nsome dirt from my shoulder, and, on leaving, he by force seized my hat\r\nand brushed it--all which habits of attention he had contracted whilst\r\nin service.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to see stuck in the wristband of his coat-sleeve a row\r\nof pins, arranged as neatly as in the papers sold at the mercers’.\r\n\r\n“Since the Irish have come so much--the boys, I mean--my crossing has\r\nbeen completely cut up,” he said; “and yet it is in as good a spot as\r\ncould well be, from the County Fire Office (Mr. Beaumont as owns it)\r\nto Swan and Edgar’s. It ought to be one of the fust crossings in the\r\nkingdom, but these Irish have spiled it.\r\n\r\n“I should think, as far as I can guess, I’ve been on it eight year,\r\nif not better; but it was some time before I got known. You see, it\r\ndoes a feller good to be some time on a crossing; but it all depends,\r\nof course, whether you are honest or not, for it’s according to\r\nyour honesty as you gets rewarded. By rewarded, I means, you gets a\r\ncharacter given to you by word of mouth. For instance, a party wants me\r\nto do a job for ’em, and they says, ‘Can you get any lady or gentleman\r\nto speak for you?’ And I says, ‘Yes;’ and I gets my character by word\r\nof mouth--that’s what I calls being rewarded.\r\n\r\n“Before ever I took a broom in hand, the good times had gone for\r\ncrossings and sweepers. The good times was thirty year back. In\r\nthe regular season, when _they_ (the gentry) are in town, I _have_\r\ntaken from one and sixpence to two shillings a-day; but every day’s\r\nnot alike, for people stop at home in wet days. But, you see, in\r\nwinter-time the crossings ain’t no good, and then we turn off to\r\nshovelling snow; so that, you see, a shilling a-day is even too high\r\nfor us to take regular all the year round. Now, I ain’t taken a\r\nshilling, no, nor a blessed bit of silver, for these three days. All\r\nthe quality’s out of town.\r\n\r\n“It ain’t what a man gets on a crossing as keeps him; _that_ ain’t\r\nworth mentioning. I don’t think I takes sixpence a-day regular--all the\r\nyear round, mind--on the crossing. No, I’d take my solemn oath I don’t!\r\nIf you was to put down fourpence it would be nearer the mark. I’ll tell\r\nyou the use of a crossing to such as me and my likes. It’s our shop,\r\nand it ain’t what we gets a-sweeping, but it’s a place like for us to\r\nstand, and then people as wants us, comes and fetches us.\r\n\r\n“In the summer I do a good deal in jobs. I do anything in the portering\r\nline, or if I’m called to do boots and shoes, or clean knives and\r\nforks, then I does that. But that’s only when people’s busy; for I’ve\r\nonly got one regular place I goes to, and that’s in A---- street,\r\nPiccadilly. I goes messages, parcels, letters, and anything that’s\r\nrequired, either for the master of the hotel or the gents that uses\r\nthere. Now, there’s one party at Swan and Edgar’s, and I goes to take\r\nparcels for him sometimes; and he won’t trust anybody but me, for you\r\nsee I’m know’d to be trustworthy, and then they reckons me as safe as\r\nthe Bank,--there, that’s just it.\r\n\r\n“I got to the hotel only lately. You see, when the peace was on and\r\nthe soldiers was coming home from the Crimmy, then the governor he\r\nwas exceeding busy, so he give me two shillings a-day and my board;\r\nbut that wasn’t reg’lar, for as he wants me he comes and fetches me.\r\nIt’s a-nigh impossible to say what I makes, it don’t turn out reg’lar;\r\nSunday’s a shilling or one-and-sixpence, other days nothing at all--not\r\nsalt to my porridge. You see, when I helps the party at the hotel, I\r\ngets my food, and that’s a lift. I’ve never put down what I made in the\r\ncourse of the year, but I’ve got enough to find food and raiment for\r\nmyself and family. Sir, I think I may say I gets about six shillings\r\na-week, but it ain’t more.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been abroad a good deal. I was in Cape Town, Table Bay,\r\none-and-twenty miles from Simons’ Town--for you see the French\r\nmans-of-war comes in at Cape Town, and the English mans-of-war comes\r\nin at Simons’ Town. I was a gentleman’s servant over there, and a very\r\ngood place it was; and if anybody was to have told me years back that I\r\nwas to have come to what I am now, I could never have credited it; but\r\nmisfortunes has brought me to what I am.\r\n\r\n“I come to England thinking to better myself, if so be it was the\r\nopportunity; besides, I was tired of Africy, and anxious to see my\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\n“I was very hard up--ay, very hard up indeed--before I took to the\r\ncross, and, in preference to turning out dishonest, I says, I’ll buy a\r\nbroom and go and sweep and get a honest livelihood.\r\n\r\n“There was a Jewish lady and her husband used to live in the Suckus,\r\nand I knowed them and the family--very fine sons they was--and I went\r\ninto the shop to ask them to let me work before the shop, and they give\r\nme their permission so to do, and, says she, ‘I’ll allow you threepence\r\na-week.’ They’ve been good friends to me, and send me a messages; and\r\nwherever they be, may they do well, I says.\r\n\r\n“I sometimes gets clothes give to me, but it’s only at Christmas times,\r\nor after its over; and that helps me along--it does so, indeed.\r\n\r\n“Whenever I sees a pin or a needle, I picks it up; sometimes I finds\r\nas many as a dozen a-day, and I always sticks them either in my cuff\r\nor in my waistcoat. Very often a lady sees ’em, and then they comes\r\nto me and says, ‘Can you oblige me with a pin?’ and I says, ‘Oh yes,\r\nmarm; a couple, or three, if you requires them;’ but it turns out very\r\nrare that I gets a trifle for anything like that. I only does it to be\r\nobliging--besides, it makes you friends, like.\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell who’s got the best crossing in London. I’m no judge of\r\nthat; it isn’t a broom as can keep a man now. They’re going out of town\r\nso fast, all the harristocracy; though it’s middling classes--such as\r\nis in a middling way like--as is the best friends to me.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRADESMAN’S CROSSING-SWEEPER.\r\n\r\nA man who had worked at crossing-sweeping as a boy when he first came\r\nto London, and again when he grew too old to do his work as a labourer\r\nin a coal-yard, gave me a statement of the kind of life he led, and the\r\nearnings he made. He was an old man, with a forehead so wrinkled that\r\nthe dark, waved lines reminded me of the grain of oak. His thick hair\r\nwas, despite his great age--which was nearly seventy--still dark; and\r\nas he conversed with me, he was continually taking off his hat, and\r\nwiping his face with what appeared to be a piece of flannel, about a\r\nfoot square.\r\n\r\nHis costume was of what might be called “the all-sorts” kind, and, from\r\nconstant wear, it had lost its original colour, and had turned into a\r\nsort of dirty green-grey hue. It consisted of a waistcoat of tweed,\r\nfastened together with buttons of glass, metal, and bone; a tail-coat,\r\nturned brown with weather, a pair of trousers repaired here and there\r\nwith big stitches, like the teeth of a comb, and these formed the\r\nextent of his wardrobe. Around the collar of the coat and waistcoat,\r\nand on the thighs of the pantaloons, the layers of grease were so thick\r\nthat the fibre of the cloth was choked up, and it looked as if it had\r\nbeen pieced with bits of leather.\r\n\r\nRubbing his unshorn chin, whereon the bristles stood up like the\r\npegs in the barrel of a musical-box--until it made a noise like a\r\nhair-brush, he began his story:--\r\n\r\n“I’m known all about in Parliament-street--ay, every bit about them\r\nparts,--for more than thirty year. Ay, I’m as well known as the\r\nstatty itself, all about them parts at Charing-cross. Afore I took to\r\ncrossing-sweeping I was at coal-work. The coal-work I did was backing\r\nand filling, and anythink in that way. I worked at Wood’s, and Penny’s,\r\nand Douglas’s. They were good masters, Mr. Wood ’specially; but the\r\nwork was too much for me as I got old. There was plenty of coal work\r\nin them times; indeed, I’ve yearned as much as nine shillings of a\r\nday. That was the time as the meters was on. Now men can hardly earn a\r\nliving at coal-work. I left the coal-work because I was took ill with a\r\nfever, as was brought on by sweating--over-_exaction_ they called it.\r\nIt left me so weak I wasn’t able to do nothink in the yards.\r\n\r\n“I know Mr. G----, the fishmonger, and Mr. J----, the publican. I\r\nshould think Mr. J---- has knowed me this eight-and-thirty-year, and\r\nthey put me on to the crossing. You see, when I was odd man at a coal\r\njob, I’d go and do whatever there was to be done in the neighbourhood.\r\nIf there was anythink as Mr. G----’s men couldn’t do--such as carrying\r\nfish home to a customer, when the other men were busy--I was sent for.\r\nOr Mr. J---- would send me with sperrits--a gallon, or half a gallon,\r\nor anythink of that sort--a long journey. In fact, I’d get anythink as\r\ncome handy.\r\n\r\n“I had done crossing-sweeping as a boy, before I took to coal-work,\r\nwhen I first come out of the country. My own head first put me up to\r\nthe notion, and that’s more than fifty year ago--ay, more than that;\r\nbut I can’t call to mind exactly, for I’ve had no parents ever since I\r\nwas eight year old, and now I’m nigh seventy; but it’s as close as I\r\ncan remember. I was about thirteen at that time. There was no police on\r\nthen, and I saw a good bit of road as was dirty, and says I, ‘That’s a\r\ngood spot to keep clean,’ and I took it. I used to go up to the tops of\r\nthe houses to throw over the snow, and I’ve often been obliged to get\r\nmen to help me. I suppose I was about the first person as ever swept\r\na crossing in Charing-cross; (here, as if proud of the fact, he gave\r\na kind of moist chuckle, which ended in a fit of coughing). I used to\r\nmake a good bit of money then; but it ain’t worth nothink, now.\r\n\r\n“After I left coal-backing, I went back to the old crossing opposite\r\nthe Adm’ralty gates, and I stopped there until Mr. G---- give me\r\nthe one I’m on now, and thank him for it, I says. Mr. G---- had the\r\ncrossing paved, as leads to his shop, to accommodate the customers.\r\nHe had a German there to sweep it afore me. He used to sweep in the\r\nday--come about ten or eleven o’clock in the morning, and then at night\r\nhe turned watchman; for when there was any wenson, as Mr. G---- deals\r\nin, hanging out, he was put to watch it. This German worked there, I\r\nreckon, about seven year, and when he died I took the crossing.\r\n\r\n“The crossing ain’t much of a living for any body--that is, what I\r\ntakes on it. But then I’ve got regular customers as gives me money.\r\nThere’s Mr. G----, he gives a shilling a-week; and there’s Captain\r\nR----, of the Adm’ralty, he gives me sixpence a fortnight; and another\r\ncaptain, of the name of R----, he gives me fourpence every Sunday.\r\nAh! I’d forgot Mr. O----, the Secretary at the Adm’ralty; he gives me\r\nsixpence now and then. Besides, I do a lot of odd jobs for different\r\npeople; they knows where to come and find me when they wants me. They\r\ngets me to carry letters, or a parcel, or a box, or anythink of that\r\nthere. I has a bit of vittals, too, give me every now and then; but as\r\nfor money, it’s very little as I get on the crossings--perhaps seven or\r\neight shilling a-week, reg’lar customers and all.\r\n\r\n“I never heard of anybody as was leaving a crossing selling it; no,\r\nnever. My crossing ain’t a reg’lar one as anybody could have. If I was\r\nto leave, it depends upon whether Mr. G---- would like to have the\r\nparty, as to who gets it. There’s no such thing as turning a reg’lar\r\nsweeper out, the police stops that. I’ve been known to them for years,\r\nand they are very kind to me. As they come’s by they says, ‘Jimmy, how\r\nare you?’ You see, my crossing comes handy for them, for it’s agin\r\nScotland-yard; and when they turns out in their clean boots it saves\r\ntheir blacking.\r\n\r\n“Lord G---- used to be at the Adm’ralty, but he ain’t there now; I\r\ndon’t know why he left, but he’s gone. He used to give me sixpence\r\nevery now and then when he come over. I was near to my crossing when\r\nMr. Drummond was shot, but I wasn’t near enough to hear the pistol; but\r\nI didn’t see nothink. I know’d the late Sir Robert Peel, oh, certantly,\r\nbut he seldom crossed over my crossing, though whenever he did, he’d\r\ngive me somethink. The present Sir Robert goes over to the chapel in\r\nSpring-gardens when he’s in town, but he keeps on the other side of the\r\nway; so I never had anythink from him. He’s the very picture of his\r\nfather, and I knows him from that, only his father were rather stouter\r\nthan he is. I don’t know none of the members of parliament, they most\r\non ’em keeps on shifting so, that I hasn’t no time to recognise ’em.\r\n\r\n“The watering-carts ain’t no friends of our’n. They makes dirt and no\r\npay for cleaning it. There’s so much traffic with coaches and carts\r\ngoing right over my crossing that a fine or wet day don’t make much\r\ndifference to me, for people are afraid to cross for fear of being run\r\nover. I’m forced to have my eyes about me and dodge the wehicles. I\r\nnever heerd, as I can tell on, of a crossing-sweeper being run over.”\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE ABLE-BODIED FEMALE CROSSING-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD WOMAN “OVER THE WATER.”\r\n\r\nShe is the widow of a sweep--“as respectable and ’dustrious a man,”\r\nI was told, “as any in the neighbourhood of the ‘Borough;’ he was a\r\nshort man, sir,--very short,” said my informant, “and had a weakness\r\nfor top-boots, white hats, and leather breeches,” and in that\r\nunsweeplike costume he would parade himself up and down the Dover and\r\nNew Kent-roads. He had a capital connexion (or, as his widow terms it,\r\n“seat of business”), and left behind him a good name and reputation\r\nthat would have kept the “seat of business” together, if it had not\r\nbeen for the misconduct of the children, two of whom (sons) have been\r\ntransported, while a daughter “went wrong,” though she, wretched\r\ncreature, paid a fearful penalty, I learnt, for her frailties, having\r\nbeen burnt to death in the middle of the night, through a careless\r\nhabit of smoking in bed.\r\n\r\nThe old sweeper herself, eighty years of age, and almost beyond labour,\r\nvery deaf, and rather feeble to all appearance, yet manages to get\r\nout every morning between four and five, so as to catch the workmen\r\nand “time-keepers” on their way to the factories. She has the true\r\nobsequious curtsey, but is said to be very strong in her “likes and\r\ndislikes.”\r\n\r\nShe bears a good character, though sometimes inclining, I was informed,\r\ntowards “the other half-pint,” but never guilty of any excess. She is\r\nsomewhat profuse in her scriptural ejaculations and professions of\r\ngratitude. Her statement was as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Fifteen years I’ve been on the crossing, come next Christmas. My\r\nhusband died in Guy’s Hospital, of the cholera, three days after he got\r\nin, and I took to the crossing some time after. I had nothing to do.\r\nI am eighty years of age, and I couldn’t do hard work. I have nothing\r\nbut what the great God above pleases to give me. The poor woman who had\r\nthe crossing before me was killed, and so I took it. The gentleman who\r\nwas the foreman of the road, gave me the grant to take it. I didn’t\r\nask him, for poor people as wants a bit of bread they goes on the\r\ncrossings as they likes, but he never interfered with me. The first day\r\nI took sixpence; but them good times is all gone, they’ll never come\r\nback again. The best times I used to take a shilling a-day, and now I\r\ndon’t take but a few pence. The winter is as bad as the summer, for\r\npoor people haven’t got it to give, and gentlefolks get very near now.\r\nPeople are not so liberal as they used to be, and they never will be\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“To do a hard day’s washing, I couldn’t. I used to go to a lady’s house\r\nto do a bit of washing when I had my strength, but I can’t do it now.\r\n\r\n“People going to their offices at six or seven in the morning gives me\r\na ha’penny or a penny; if they don’t, I must go without it. I go at\r\nfive, and stand there till eleven or twelve, till I find it is no use\r\nbeing there any longer. Oh, the gentlemen give me the most, I’m sure;\r\nthe ladies don’t give me nothing.\r\n\r\n“At Christmas I get a few things--a gentleman gave me these boots I’ve\r\ngot on, and a ticket for a half-quartern loaf and a hundred of coals. I\r\nhave got as much as five shillings at Christmas--but those times will\r\nnever come back again. I get no more than two shillings and sixpence at\r\nChristmas now.\r\n\r\n“My husband, Thomas ---- was his name, was a chimley-sweep. He did a\r\nvery good business--it was all done by his sons. We had a boy with\r\nus, too, just as a friendly boy. I was a mother and a mistress to\r\nhim. I’ve had eleven children. I’m grandmother to fifteen, and a\r\ngreat-grandmother, too. They won’t give me a bite of bread, though, any\r\nof ’em, I’ve got four children living, as far as I know, two abroad\r\nand two home here with families. I never go among ’em. It is not in my\r\npower to assist ’em, so I never go to distress ’em.\r\n\r\n“I get two shilling a-week from the parish, and I have to pay out of\r\nthat for a quartern loaf, a quartern of sugar, and an ounce of tea. The\r\nparish forces it on me, so I must take it, and that only leaves me one\r\nshilling and fourpence. A shilling of it goes for my lodging. I lodge\r\nwith people who knew my family and me, and took a liking to me; they\r\nlet me come there instead of wandering about the streets.\r\n\r\n“I stand on my crossing till I’m like to drop over my broom with\r\ntiredness. Yes, sir, I go to church at St. George’s in the Borough. I\r\ngo there every Sunday morning, after I leave my roads. They’ve taken\r\nthe organ and charity children away that used to be there when I was a\r\ngirl, so it’s not a church now, it’s a chapel. There’s nothing but the\r\npreacher and the gentlefolks, and they sings their own psalms. There\r\nare gatherings at that church, but whether it’s for the poor or not I\r\ndon’t know. _I_ don’t get any of it.\r\n\r\n“It was a great loss to me when my husband died; I went all to ruin\r\nthen. My father belonged to Scotland, at Edinboro’. My mother came from\r\nYorkshire. I don’t know where Scotland is no more than the dead. My\r\nfather was a gentleman’s gardener and watchman. My mother used to go\r\nout a-chairing, and she was drowned just by Horsemonger Lane. She was\r\ncoming through the Halfpenny Hatch, that used to be just facing the\r\nCrown and Anchor, in the New Kent-road; there was an open ditch there,\r\nsir. She took the left-hand turning instead of the right, and was\r\ndrownded. My father died in St. Martin’s Workhouse. He died of apoplexy\r\nfit.\r\n\r\n“I used to mind my father’s place till mother died. His housekeeper\r\nI was--God help me! a fine one too. Thank the Lord, my husband was a\r\nclever man; he had a good seat of business. I lost my right hand when\r\nhe died. I couldn’t carry it on. There was my two sons went for sogers,\r\nand the others were above their business. He left a seat of business\r\nworth a hundred pound; he served all up the New Kent-road. He was\r\nbeloved by all his people. He used to climb himself when I first had\r\nhim, but he left it off when he got children. I had my husband when I\r\nwas fifteen, and kept him forty years. Ah! he was well-beloved by all\r\naround, except his children, and they behaved shameful. I said to his\r\neldest son, when he lay in the hospital, (asking your pardon, sir,\r\nfor mentioning it)--I says to his eldest son, ‘Billy,’ says I, ‘your\r\nfather’s very bad--why don’t you go to see him?’ ‘Oh,’ says he, ‘he’s\r\nall right, he’s gettin’ better;’ and he was never the one to go and see\r\nhim once; and he never come to the funeral.\r\n\r\n“Billy thought I should come upon him after his death, but I never\r\ntroubled him for as much as a crumb of bread.\r\n\r\n“I never get spoken to on my roads, only some people say, ‘Good\r\nmorning,’ ‘There you are, old lady.’ They never asks me no questions\r\nwhatsomever. I never get run over, though I am very hard of hearing;\r\nbut I am forced to have my eyes here, there, and everywhere, to keep\r\nout of the way of the carts and coaches.\r\n\r\n“Some days I goes to my crossing, and earns nothink at all: other\r\ndays it’s sometimes fourpence, sometimes sixpence. I earned fourpence\r\nto-day, and I had a bit of snuff out of it. Why, I believe I did\r\nyearn fivepence yesterday--I won’t tell no story. I got ninepence on\r\nSunday--that was a good day; but, God knows, that didn’t go far. I\r\nyearned so much I couldn’t bring it home on Saturday--it almost makes\r\nme laugh,--I yearned sixpence.\r\n\r\n“I goes every morning, winter or summer, frost or snow; and at the same\r\nhour (five o’clock); people certainly don’t think of giving so much in\r\nfine weather. Nobody ever mislested me, and I never mislested nobody.\r\nIf they gives me a penny, I thanks ’em; and if they gives me nothing, I\r\nthanks ’em all the same.\r\n\r\n“If I was to go into the House, I shouldn’t live three days. It’s not\r\nthat I eat much--a very little is enough for me; but it’s the air I\r\nshould miss: to be shut up like a thief, I couldn’t live long, I know.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD WOMAN CROSSING-SWEEPER WHO HAD A PENSIONER.\r\n\r\nThis old dame is remarkable from the fact of being the chief support of\r\na poor deaf cripple, who is as much poorer than the crossing-sweeper as\r\nshe is poorer than Mrs. ----, in ---- street, who allows the sweeper\r\nsixpence a-week. The crossing-sweeper is a rather stout old woman, with\r\na carneying tone, and constant curtsey. She complains, in common with\r\nmost of her class, of the present hard times, and reverts longingly to\r\nthe good old days when people were more liberal than they are now, and\r\nhad more to give. She says:--\r\n\r\n“I was on my crossing before the police was made, for I am not able to\r\nwork, and only get helped by the people who knows me. Mr. ----, in the\r\nsquare, gives me a shilling a-week; Mrs. ----, in ---- street, gives\r\nme sixpence; (she has gone in the country now, but she has left it at\r\nthe oil-shop for me); that’s what I depinds upon, darlin’, to help pay\r\nmy rent, which is half-a-crown. My rent was three shillings, till the\r\nlandlord didn’t wish me to go, ’cause I was so punctual with my money.\r\nI give a corner of my room to a poor cretur, who’s deaf as a beadle;\r\nshe works at the soldiers’ coats, and is a very good hand at it, and\r\nwould earn a good deal of money if she had constant work. She owed as\r\ngood as twelve shillings and sixpence for rent, poor thing, where\r\nshe was last, and the landlord took all her goods except her bed; she’s\r\ngot that, so I give her a corner of my room for charity’s sake. We must\r\nlook to one another: she’s as poor as a church mouse. I thought she\r\nwould be company for me, still a deaf person is but poor company to\r\none. She had that heavy sickness they call the cholera about five years\r\nago, and it fell in her side and in the side of her head too--that made\r\nher deaf. Oh! she’s a poor object. She has been with me since the month\r\nof February. I’ve lent her money out of my own pocket. I give her a\r\ncup of tea or a slice of bread when I see she hasn’t got any. Then the\r\npeople up-stairs are kind to her, and give her a bite and a sup.\r\n\r\n“My husband was a soldier; he fought at the battle of Waterloo.\r\nHis pension was ninepence a-day. All my family are dead, except my\r\ngrandson, what’s in New Orleans. I expect him back this very month that\r\nnow we have: he gave me four pounds before he went, to carry me over\r\nthe last winter.\r\n\r\n“If the Almighty God pleases to send him back, he’ll be a great help to\r\nme. He’s all I’ve got left. I never had but two children in all my life.\r\n\r\n“I worked in noblemen’s houses before I was married to my husband, who\r\nis dead; but he came to be poor, and I had to leave my houses where I\r\nused to work.\r\n\r\n“I took twopence-halfpenny yesterday, and threepence to-day; the day\r\nbefore yesterday I didn’t take a penny. I never come out on Sunday; I\r\ngoes to Rosomon-street Chapel. Last Saturday I made one shilling and\r\nsixpence; on Friday, sixpence. I dare say I make three shillings and\r\nsixpence a-week, besides the one shilling and sixpence I gets allowed\r\nme. I am forced to make a do of it somehow, but I’ve no more strength\r\nleft in me than this ould broom.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROSSING-SWEEPER WHO HAD BEEN A SERVANT-MAID.\r\n\r\nShe is to be found any day between eight in the morning and seven in\r\nthe evening, sweeping away in a convulsive, jerky sort of manner, close\r\nto ---- square, near the Foundling. She may be known by her pinched-up\r\nstraw bonnet, with a broad, faded, almost colourless ribbon. She has\r\nweak eyes, and wears over them a brownish shade. Her face is tied up,\r\nbecause of a gathering which she has on her head. She wears a small,\r\nold plaid cloak, a clean checked apron, and a tidy printed gown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CROSSING-SWEEPER THAT HAS BEEN A MAID-SERVANT.\r\n\r\n[_From a Photograph._]]\r\n\r\nShe is rather shy at first, but willing and obliging enough withal; and\r\nshe lives down Little ---- Yard, in Great ---- street. The “yard” that\r\nis made like a mousetrap--small at the entrance, but amazingly large\r\ninside, and dilapidated though extensive.\r\n\r\nHere are stables and a couple of blind alleys, nameless, or bearing\r\nthe same name as the yard itself, and wherein are huddled more people\r\nthan one could count in a quarter of an hour, and more children\r\nthan one likes to remember,--dirty children, listlessly trailing an\r\nold tin baking-dish, or a worn-out shoe, tied to a piece of string;\r\nsullen children, who turn away in a fit of sleepy anger if spoken to;\r\nscreaming children, setting all the parents in the “yard” at defiance;\r\nand quiet children, who are arranging banquets of dirt in the reeking\r\ngutters.\r\n\r\nThe “yard” is devoted principally to costermongers.\r\n\r\nThe crossing-sweeper lives in the top-room of a two-storied house, in\r\nthe very depth of the blind alley at the end of the yard. She has not\r\neven a room to herself, but pays one shilling a-week for the privilege\r\nof sleeping with a woman who gets her living by selling tapes in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” says the sweeper, “poor woman, she _has_ a hard time of it; her\r\nhusband is in the hospital with a bad leg--in fact, he’s scarcely\r\never out. If you could hear that woman cough, you’d never forget it.\r\nShe would have had to starve to-day if it hadn’t been for a person\r\nwho actually lent her a gown to pledge to raise her stock-money, poor\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\nThe room in which these people live has a sloping roof, and a\r\nsmall-paned window on each side. For furniture, there were two chairs\r\nand a shaky, three-legged stool, a deal table, and a bed rolled up\r\nagainst the wall--nothing else. In one corner of the room lay the last\r\nlump remaining of the seven pounds of coals. In another corner there\r\nwere herbs in pans, and two water-bottles without their noses. The most\r\nstriking thing in that little room was some crockery, the woman had\r\nmanaged to save from the wreck of her things; among this, curiously\r\nenough, was a soup-tureen, with its lid not even cracked.\r\n\r\nThere _was_ a piece of looking-glass--a small three-cornered\r\npiece--forming an almost equilateral triangle,--and the oldest, and\r\nmost rubbed and worn-out piece of a mirror that ever escaped the\r\ndust-bin.\r\n\r\nThe fireplace was a very small one, and on the table were two or\r\nthree potatoes and about one-fifth of a red herring, which the poor\r\nstreet-seller had saved out of her breakfast to serve for her supper.\r\n“Take my solemn word for it, sir,” said the sweeper, “and I wouldn’t\r\ndeceive you, that is all she will get besides a cup of weak tea when\r\nshe comes home tired at night.”\r\n\r\nThe statement of this old sweeper is as follows:--\r\n\r\n“My name is Mary ----. I live in ---- yard. I live with a person of the\r\nname of ----, in the back attic; she gets her living by selling flowers\r\nin pots in the street, but she is now doing badly. I pay her a shilling\r\na-week.\r\n\r\n“My parents were Welsh. I was in service, or maid-of-all-work, till I\r\ngot married. My husband was a seafaring man when I married him. After\r\nwe were married, he got his living by selling memorandum-almanack\r\nbooks, and the like, about the streets. He was driven to that because\r\nhe had no trade in his hand, and he was obliged to do something for\r\na living. He did not make much, and over-exertion, with want of\r\nnourishment, brought on a paralytic stroke. He had the first fit about\r\ntwo years before he had the second; the third fit, which was the last,\r\nhe had on the Monday, and died on the Wednesday week. I have two\r\nchildren still living. One of them is married to a poor man, who gets\r\nhis living in the streets; but as far as lays in his power he makes a\r\ngood husband and father. My other daughter is living with a niece of\r\nmine, for I can’t keep her, sir; she minds the children.\r\n\r\n“My father was a journeyman shoemaker. He was killed; but I cannot\r\nremember how--I was too young. I can’t recollect my mother. I was\r\nbrought up by an uncle and aunt till I was able to go to service. I\r\nwent out to service at five, to mind children under a nurse, and I was\r\nin service till I got married. I had a great many situations; you see,\r\nsir, I was forced to keep in place, because I had nowhere to go to, my\r\nuncle and aunt not being able to keep me. I was never in noblemen’s\r\nfamilies, only trades-people’s. Service was very hard, sir, and so I\r\nbelieve it continues.\r\n\r\n“I am fifty-five years of age, and I have been on the crossing fourteen\r\nyears; but just now it is very poor work indeed. Well, if I wishes for\r\nbad weather, I’m only like other people, I suppose. I have no regular\r\ncustomers at all; the only one I had left has lost his senses, sir.\r\nMr. H----, he used to allow us sixpence a-week; but he went mad, and\r\nwe don’t get it now. By us, I mean the three crossing-sweepers in the\r\nsquare where I work.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I like the winter-time, for the families is in. Though the\r\nweather is more severe, yet you _do_ get a few more ha’pence. I take\r\nmore from the staid elderly people than from the young. At Christmas, I\r\nthink I took about eleven shillings, but certainly not more. The most\r\nI ever made at that season was fourteen shillings. The worst about\r\nChristmas is, that those who give much then generally hold their hand\r\nfor a week or two.\r\n\r\n“A shilling a-day would be as much as I want, sir. I have stood in the\r\nsquare all day for a ha’penny, and I have stood here for nothing. One\r\nweek with another, I make two shillings in the seven days, after paying\r\nfor my broom. I have taken threppence ha’penny to-day. Yesterday--let\r\nme see--well, it was threppence ha’penny, too; Monday I don’t remember;\r\nbut Sunday I recollect--it was fippence ha’penny. Years ago I made a\r\ngreat deal more--nearly three times as much.\r\n\r\n“I come about eight o’clock in the morning, and go away about six or\r\nseven; I am here every day. The boys used to come at one time with\r\ntheir brooms, but they’re not allowed here now by the police.\r\n\r\n“I should not think crossings worth purchasing, unless people made a\r\nbetter living on them than I do.”\r\n\r\nI gave the poor creature a small piece of silver for her trouble, and\r\nasked her if that, with the threepence halfpenny, made a good day. She\r\nanswered heartily--\r\n\r\n“I should like to see such another day to-morrow, sir.\r\n\r\n“Yes, winter is very much better than summer, only for the trial of\r\nstanding in the frost and snow, but we certainly _do_ get more then.\r\nThe families won’t be in town for three months to come yet. Ah! this\r\nneighbourhood is nothing to what it was. By God’s removal, and by their\r\nown removal, the good families are all gone. The present families are\r\nnot so liberal nor so wealthy. It is not the richest people that give\r\nthe most. Tradespeople, and ’specially gentlefolks who have situations,\r\nare better to me than the nobleman who rides in his carriage.\r\n\r\n“I always go to Trinity Church, Gray’s-inn-road, about two doors from\r\nthe Welsh School--the Rev. Dr. Witherington preaches there. I always go\r\non Sunday afternoon and evening, for I can’t go in the morning; I can’t\r\nget away from my crossing in time. I never omit a day in coming here,\r\nunless I’m ill, or the snow is too heavy, or the weather too bad, and\r\nthen I’m obligated to resign.\r\n\r\n“I have no friends, sir, only my children; my uncle and aunt have been\r\ndead a long time. I go to see my children on Sunday, or in the evening,\r\nwhen I leave here.\r\n\r\n“After I leave I have a cup of tea, and after that I go to bed; very\r\nfrequently I’m in bed at nine o’clock. I have my cup of tea if I can\r\nanyway get it; but I’m forced to go without _that_ sometimes.\r\n\r\n“When my sight was better, I used to be very partial to reading; but\r\nI can’t see the print, sir, now. I used to read the Bible, and the\r\nnewspaper. Story-books I have read, too, but not many novels. Yes,\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_ I know, but not the _Pilgrim’s Progress_. I’ve heard\r\nof it; they tell me it is a very interesting book to read, but I never\r\nhad it. We never have any ladies or Scripture-readers come to our\r\nlodgings; you see, we’re so out, they might come a dozen times and not\r\nfind us at home.\r\n\r\n“I wear out three brooms in a-week; but in the summer one will\r\nlast a fortnight. I give threepence ha’penny for them; there are\r\ntwopenny-ha’penny brooms, but they are not so good, they are liable\r\nto have their handles come out. It is very fatiguing standing so many\r\nhours; my legs aches with pain, and swells. I was once in Middlesex\r\nHospital for sixteen weeks with my legs. My eyes have been weak from a\r\nchild. I have got a gathering in my head from catching cold standing on\r\nthe crossing. I had the fever this time twelvemonth. I laid a fortnight\r\nand four days at home, and seven weeks in the hospital. I took the\r\ndiarrhœa after that, and was six weeks under the doctor’s hands. I\r\nused to do odd jobs, but my health won’t permit me now. I used to make\r\ntwo or three shillings a-week by ’em, and get scraps and things. But I\r\nget no broken victuals now.\r\n\r\n“I never get anything from servants; they don’t get more than they know\r\nwhat to do with.\r\n\r\n“I don’t get a drop of beer once in a month.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know but what this being out may be the best thing, after all;\r\nfor if I was at home all my time, it would not agree with me.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF “OLD JOHN,” THE WATERMAN AT THE FARRINGDON-STREET\r\nCAB-STAND, CONCERNING THE OLD BLACK CROSSING-SWEEPER WHO LEFT £800 TO\r\nMISS WAITHMAN.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, I knew him for many year, though I never spoke to him in all\r\nmy life. He was a stoutish, thickset man, about my build, and used to\r\nwalk with his broom up and down--so.”\r\n\r\nHere “Old John” imitated the halt and stoop of an old man.\r\n\r\n“He used to touch his hat continually,” he went on. “‘Please remember\r\nthe poor black man,’ was his cry, never anything else. Oh yes, he\r\nmade a great deal of money. People gave more then than they do now.\r\nWhere they give one sixpence now, they _used_ to give ten. It’s just\r\nthe same by our calling. Lived humbly? Yes, I think he did; at all\r\nevents, he seemed to do so when he was on his crossing. He got plenty\r\nof odds-and-ends from the corner _there_--Alderman Waithman’s, I mean;\r\nhe was a very sober, quiet sort of man. No, sir, nothing peculiar in\r\nhis dress. Some blacks are peculiar in their dress; but he would wear\r\nanything he could get give him. They used to call him Romeo, I think.\r\nCur’ous name, sir; but the best man I ever knew was called Romeo, and\r\nhe was a black.\r\n\r\n“The crossing-sweeper had his regular customers; he knew their times,\r\nand was there to the moment. Oh yes, he was always. Hail, rain, or\r\nsnow, he never missed. I don’t know how long he had the crossing.\r\nI remember him ever since I was a postboy in Doctors’ Commons; I\r\nknew him when I lived in Holborn, and I haven’t been away from this\r\nneighbourhood since 1809.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, there’s no doubt about his leaving the money to Miss\r\nWaithman. Everybody round about here knows it; just ask them, sir. Miss\r\nWaithman (an old maid she were, sir) used to be very kind to him. He\r\nused to sweep from Alderman Waithman’s (it’s the _Sunday Times_ now)\r\nacross to the opposite side of the way.\r\n\r\n“When he died, an old man, as had been a soldier, took possession\r\nof the crossing. How did he get it? Why, I say, he _took it_. First\r\ncome, first sarved, sir; that’s their way. They never sell crossings.\r\nSometimes (for a lark) they shift, and then one stands treat--a gallon\r\nof beer, or something of that sort. The perlice interfered with the\r\nsoldier--you know the sweepers is all forced to go if the perlice\r\ninterfere; now with us, sir, we are licensed, and they can’t make us\r\nmove on. They interfered, I say, with the old soldier, because he\r\nused to get so drunk. Why, at a public-house close at hand, he would\r\nspent seven, eight, and ten shillings on a night, three or four days\r\ntogether. He used to gather so many blackguards round the crossing,\r\nthey were forced to move him at last. A young man has got it now; he\r\nhas had it three year. He is not always here, sometimes away for a week\r\nat a stretch; but, you see, he knows the best times to come, and then\r\nhe is _sure_ to be here. The little boys come with their brooms now and\r\nthen, but the perlice always drive them away.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE ABLE-BODIED IRISH CROSSING-SWEEPER.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD IRISH CROSSING-SWEEPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis man, a native of “County Corruk,” has been in England only two\r\nyears and a half. He wears a close-fitting black cloth cap over a shock\r\nof reddish hair; round his neck he has a coloured cotton kerchief, of\r\nthe sort advertised as “Imitation Silk.” His black coat is much torn,\r\nand his broom is at present remarkably stumpy. He waits quietly at the\r\npost opposite St. ----’s Church, to receive whatever is offered him.\r\nHe is unassuming enough in his manner, and, as will be seen, not even\r\nbearing any malice against his two enemies, “The Swatestuff Man” and\r\n“The Switzer.” He says:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IRISH CROSSING-SWEEPER.\r\n\r\n[_From a Photograph._]]\r\n\r\n“I’ve been at this crossin’ near upon two year. Whin I first come over\r\nto England (about two years and a half ago), I wint a haymakin’, but,\r\nyou see, I couldn’t get any work; and afther thrampin’ about a good\r\nbit, why my eyesight gettin’ very wake, and I not knowin’ what to do, I\r\ntook this crossin’.\r\n\r\n“How did I get it?--Will, sir, I wint walkin’ about and saw it, and\r\nnobody on it. So one mornin’ I brought a broom wid me and stood here.\r\nYes, sir, I _was_ intherfered wid. The man with one arm--a Switzer they\r\ncalls him--he had had the crossin’ on Sundays for a long while gone,\r\nand he didn’t like my bein’ here at all, at all. ‘B----y Irish’ he used\r\nto call me, and other scandalizin’ names; and he and the swatestuff man\r\nopposite, who was a friend of his, tried everythin’ they could to git\r\nme off the crossin’. But sure I niver harrumed them at all, at all.\r\n\r\n“Yis, sir, I have my rigular custhomers: there’s Mr. ----, he’s gone\r\nto Sydenham; he’s very kind, sir. He gives me a shilling a-month. He\r\nleft worrud with the sarvint while he’s away to give me a shilling on\r\nthe first day in every month. He gave me a letter to the Eye Hospital,\r\nin Goulden Square, because of the wakeness of my eyesight; but they’ll\r\nniver cure it at all, at all, sir, for wake eyes runs in my family. My\r\nsister, sir, has wake eyes; she is working at Croydon.\r\n\r\n“Oh no, indeed, and it isn’t the gintlefolks that thry to get me off\r\nthe crossin’; they’d rather shupport me, sir. But the poor payple it is\r\nthat don’t like me.\r\n\r\n“Eighteenpince I’ve made in a day, and more: niver more than two\r\nshillings, and sometimes not sixpence. Will, sir, I am not like the\r\nothers; I don’t run afther the ladies and gintlemen--I don’t persevere.\r\nYestherday I took sixpence, by chance, for takin’ some luggage for a\r\nlady. The day before yestherday I took three ha’pence; but I think I\r\ngot somethin’ else for a bit of worruk thin.\r\n\r\n“Yes, winther is better than summer. I don’t know which people is the\r\nmost liberal. Sure, sir, I don’t think there’s much difference. Oh yes,\r\nsir, young men are very liberal sometimes, and so are young ladies.\r\nPerhaps old ladies or old gintlemen give the most at a time,--sometimes\r\nsixpence,--perhaps more; but thin, sir, you don’t git anything else for\r\na long time.\r\n\r\n“The boy-sweepers annoy me very much, indeed; they use such\r\nscandalizin’ worruds to me, and throw dirrut, they do. They know whin\r\nthe police is out of the way, so I git no purtiction.\r\n\r\n“Sure, sir, and I think it right that ivery person should attind the\r\nworruship to which he belongs. I am a Catholic, sir, and attind mass\r\nat St. Pathrick’s, near St. Giles’s, ivery Sunday, and I thry to be at\r\nconfission wonst a month.\r\n\r\n“Whin first I took to the crossin’, I was rather irrigular; but that\r\nwas because of the Switzer man--that’s the man with the one arm; he\r\nused to say he would lock me up, and iverything. But I have been\r\nrigular since.\r\n\r\n“I come in the morruning just before eight, in time to catch the\r\ngintlefolks going into prayers; and I leave at half-past seven to eight\r\nat night. I wait so late because I have to bring a gintleman wather for\r\nhis flowers, and that I do the last thing.\r\n\r\n“I live, sir, in ---- lane, behind St. Giles’s Church, in the\r\nfirst-flure front, sir; and I pay one-and-threepence a-week. There\r\nare three bids in the room. In one bid, a man, his wife, his mother,\r\nand their little girl--Julia, they call her--sleep; in the other bid,\r\nthere’s a man and his wife and child. Yes, I am single, and have the\r\nthird bid to myself. I come from County Corruk; the others in the room\r\nare all Irish, and come from County Corruk too. They sill fruit in the\r\nsthreet; in the winther they sill onions, and sometimes oranges.\r\n\r\n“There a Scotch gintleman as brings me my breakfast every morning;\r\nindeed, yes, and he brings it himself, he does. He has gone to\r\nScotland now, but he will be back in a week. He brings me some bread\r\nand mate, and a pinny for a half pint of beer, sir. He has done it\r\nalmost all the time I have been here.\r\n\r\n“The Switzer man, sir, took out boards for the _Polytickner_, or some\r\nplace like that. He got fifteen shillings a-week, and used to come here\r\non Sundays. Yes, sir, _I_ come here on Sundays; but it is not better\r\nthan other days. Some people says to me, they would rather I went to\r\nchurch; but I tells ’em I do; and sure, sir, afther mass, there’s no\r\nharrum in a little sweepin’ between whiles.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, there’s not a crossin’-sweeper in Ould Ireland. Well, sir, I\r\nniver was in Dublin; but I’ve been in Corruk, sir, and they don’t have\r\nany crossin’ sweepers there.\r\n\r\n“Whin I git home of a night, sir, I am very tired; but I always offer\r\nup my devotions before sleepin’. Ah, sir, I should niver have swipt\r\ncrossin’s if a friend of mine hadn’t died; he was collector of tolls in\r\nClarnykilts, and I used to be with him. He lost his situation, and so I\r\ncame to England.\r\n\r\n“The Switzer man, I think he used to sweep at eight o’clock,\r\njust as the people were goin’ to prayers. Oh, sir, he was always\r\nblack-geyardin’ me. ‘Go back to your own counthry,’ says he--a furriner\r\nhimsilf, too.\r\n\r\n“Will, yes sir, I do wish for bad weather; a good wit day, and a dry\r\nday afther, is the best.\r\n\r\n“Sure and they can’t turn me off my crossin’ only for my bad conduct,\r\nand I thry to be quiet and take no notice.\r\n\r\n“Yis, sir, I have always been a church-goer, and I am seventy-five. I\r\nused to have some good rigular customers, but somehow I haven’t seen\r\nanythin’ of them for this last twelvemonth. Ah! it’s in the betther\r\nneighbourhoods that people give rigularly. I niver get any broken\r\nvictuals. Three-and-sixpence is the outside of my earnings, taking one\r\nweek with the other.\r\n\r\n“What is the laste I ever took? Will, sir, for three days I haven’t\r\ntaken a farthin’. The worust week I iver had was thirteen or fourteen\r\npence altogether; the best week I iver had was the winter before\r\nlast--that harrud winter, sir, I remember takin’ seven shillings thin;\r\nbut the man at Portman-square makes the most.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, I belave there’s some of every nation in the world as\r\nsweeps crossin’s in London.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEMALE IRISH CROSSING-SWEEPER.\r\n\r\nIn a street not far from Gordon-square and the New-road, I found this\r\npoor old woman resting from her daily labour. She was sitting on the\r\nstone ledge of the iron railings at the corner of the street, huddled\r\nup in the way seemingly natural to old Irishwomen, her broom hidden\r\nas much as possible under her petticoats. Her shawl was as tidy as\r\npossible for its age. She was sixty-seven years, and had buried two\r\nhusbands and five children, fractured her ribs, and injured her groin,\r\nand had nothing left to comfort her but her crossing, her ha’porth of\r\nsnuff, and her “drop of biled wather,” by which name she indicated her\r\n“tay.”\r\n\r\nShe was very civil and intelligent, and answered my inquiries very\r\nreadily, and with rather less circumlocution than the Irish generally\r\ndisplay. She seemed much hurt at the closing of the Old St. Pancras\r\nchurchyard. “They buried my child where they’ll never bury me, sir,”\r\nshe cried.\r\n\r\nShe told the story of her accident with many involuntary movements\r\nof her hand towards the injured part, and took a sparing pinch of\r\nsnuff from a little black snuff-box, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, for\r\nwhich she said she had given a penny. She proceeded thus:--“I’m an\r\nIrishwoman, sir, and it’s from Kinsale I come, twelve miles beyond\r\nCorruk, to the left-hand side, a seaport town, and a great place for\r\nfish. It’s fifty years the sixteenth of last June since I came in\r\nSt. Giles’s parish, and there my ildest child wint did. Buried she\r\nis in Ould St. Pancras churchyarrud, where they’ll never bury me,\r\nsir, for they’ve done away with burying in churchyarruds. That girl\r\nwas forty-one year of age the seventeenth of last February, born in\r\nStratford, below Bow, in Essex. Ah! I was comfortable there; I lived\r\nthere three year and abouts. I was in sarvice at Mr. ----’s, a Frinch\r\ngintleman he was, and kept a school, where they taught Frinch and\r\nEnglish both; but I dare say they are all gone did years ago. He was a\r\nvery ould gintleman, and so was his lady; she was a North-of-England\r\nlady, but very stout, and had no children but a son and daughter. I was\r\nquite young when my aunt brought me over. My uncle was three year here\r\nbefore my aunt, and he died at Whitechapel. I was bechuxt sixteen and\r\nseventeen when I come over, and I reckon meself at sixty-seven come\r\nnext Christmas, as well as I can guess. I never had a mother, sir; she\r\ndied when I was only six months old. My father, sir, was maltster to\r\nMr. Walker the distiller, in Corruk. Ah! indeed, and my father was well\r\nto do wonst. Early or late, wit or dry, he had a guinea a-week, but he\r\nworruked day and night; he was to attind to the corun, and he would\r\nhave four min, or five or six, undther him, according as busy they\r\nmight be. My father has been did four-and-twinty year, and I wouldn’t\r\nknow a crature if I wint home. Father come over, sir, and wanted me to\r\ngo back very bad, but I wouldn’t. I was married thin, and had buried\r\nsome of my childer in St. Pancras; and for what should I lave England?\r\n\r\n“Oh! sir, I buried three in eight months,--two sons and their father.\r\nMy husband was two year and tin months keeping his bed; he has been\r\ndid fifteen years to the eighth of last March; but I’ve been married\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Siven childer I’ve had, and ounly two alive, and they’ve got enough\r\nto do to manage for thimsilves. The boy, he follers the market, and my\r\ndaughter, she is along with her husband; sure he sills in the streets,\r\nsir. I see very little of her,--she lives over in the Borough.\r\n\r\n“I think I’ll be afther going down to Kent, beyant Maidstone, a\r\nhop-picking, if I can git as much as to take me down the road.\r\n\r\n“My daughter’s husband and me don’t agree, so I’m bitter not to see\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Ivery day, sir--ivery day in the week I am here. This morunning I was\r\nhere at eight--that was earlier than usual, but I came out because I\r\nhad not broke my fast with anything but a drop of wather, and that I\r\nhad two tumblers of it from the house at the corrunner. I intind to go\r\nhome and take two hirrings, and have a drop of biled wather--tay, I\r\nmane, sir.\r\n\r\n“I come here at about half-past nine to half-past ten, but I’m gitting\r\na very bad leg. I goes home about five or six.\r\n\r\n“I have taken two ha’pennies this morning; thruppence I took yisterday;\r\nthe day before I took, I think, fourpence ha’penny; that was my taking\r\non Monday; on Sunday I mustered a shilling; on Saturday--I declare,\r\nsir, I forgit--fourpence or thruppence, I suppose, but my frinds is\r\nout of town very much. They gives me a penny rigular every Sunday, or\r\na ha’penny, and some tuppence. Of a Sunday in the good time I may take\r\neighteenpence or sixteenpence.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, of Christmas it’s better, it is--four or five shillings on a\r\nChristmas-day.\r\n\r\n“On the Monday fortnight, before last Christmas twelvemonth, I had two\r\nribs broke, and one fractured, and my grine (groin) bone injured. Oh!\r\nthe pains that I feel even now, sir. I lived then in Phillip’s-gardens,\r\nup there in the New-road. The policeman took me to the hospital. It\r\nwas eighteen days I niver got off my bid. I came out in the morunning\r\nof the Christmas-eve. I hild on by the railings as I wint along, and I\r\nthought I niver should git home. How I was knocked down was by a cart;\r\nI had my eye bad thin, the lift one, and had a cloth over it. I was\r\njust comin’ out of the archway of the courrut (close by the beer-shop)\r\naway from Mr. ----’s house, when crossing to the green-grocer’s to git\r\ntwo pound of praties for my supper, I didn’t see the cart comin’. I\r\nwas knocked down by the shaft. They called, and they called, and he\r\nwouldn’t stop, and it wint over me, it did. It was loaded with cloth;\r\nI don’t know if it wasn’t a Shoolbred’s cart, but the boy said to\r\nthe hospital-doctor and to the policeman it was heavily loaded. The\r\nboy gave me a shilling, and that was all the money I received. For a\r\ntwelvemonth I couldn’t hardly walk.\r\n\r\n“On that Christmas-day I took four-and-tinpence, but I owed it all for\r\nrint and things; and I’m sure it’s a good man that let me run it the\r\nscore.\r\n\r\n“Is it a shillin’ I iver git? Well, thin, sir, there’s one gintleman,\r\nbut he’s out of town--Sir George Hewitt--niver passes without givin’ me\r\na shillin’.\r\n\r\n“I have taken one-and-ninepence on a Sunday, and I’ve taken two\r\nshillin’s. Upon my sowl, I’ve often gone home with three ha’pence and\r\ntuppence. For this month past, put ivery day together, I haven’t taken\r\nthree shilling a-week.\r\n\r\n“I wear two brooms out in a week in bad wither, and thin p’rhaps I take\r\nfour to five shillin’, Sunday included; but for the three year since\r\nhere I’ve been on this crossin’, I niver took tin shillin’, sir, niver.\r\n\r\n“Yes, there was a man here before me: he had bad eyes, and he was\r\nobligated to lave and go into the worrukhouse; he lost the sight of\r\none of his eyes when he came back again. I knew him sweepin’ here a\r\nlong time. When he come back, I said, ‘Father,’ says I, ‘I wint on\r\nyour crossin’.’ ‘Ah,’ says he, ‘you’ve got a bad crossin’, poor woman;\r\nI wouldn’t go on it again, I wouldn’t;’ and I niver seen him since. I\r\ndon’t know whether he is living or not.\r\n\r\n“A wit day makes fourpence or fippence difference sometimes.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I have heard of crossin’-sweepers makin’ so much and so much.\r\nI hear people talkin’ about it, but, for my parrut, I wouldn’t give\r\nheed to what they say. In Oxford-street, towards the Parruks, there was\r\na man, years ago, they say, by all accounts left a dale of money.\r\n\r\n“I am niver annoyed by boys. I don’t spake to none of them. I was in\r\nsarvice till I got married, thin I used to sill fruit through Kentish\r\nTown, Highgate, and Hampstead; but I niver sould in the streets,\r\nsir, and had my rigular customers like any greengrocer. I had a good\r\nconnixion, I had; but, by gitting old and feeble, and sick, and not\r\nbeing able to go about, I was forrussed to give it up, I was. I\r\ncouldn’t carry twelve pound upon my hid--no, not if I was to get a\r\nsov’rin a-day for it, now.\r\n\r\n“I niver lave the crossin’. I haven’t got a frind; nor a day’s pleasure\r\nI niver take.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, sir, I must have a pinch--this is my snuff-box. I take a\r\nha’porth a-day, and that’s the only comforrut I’ve got--that and a cup\r\nof tay; for I can’t dthrink cocoa or coffee-tay.\r\n\r\n“My feeding is a bit of brid and butther. I haven’t bought a bit of\r\nmate these three months. I used to git two penn’orth of bones and mate\r\nat Mrs. Baker’s, down there; but mate is so dear, that they don’t have\r\n’em now, and it’s ashamed I am of botherin’ thim so often. I frequintly\r\nhave a hirrin’. Oh dear! no sir. Wather is my dthrink. I can’t afforrud\r\nno beer. Sometimes I have a penn’orth of gin and could water, and I\r\nfind it do me a worruld of good. Sometimes I git enough to eat, but\r\nlately, indeed, I can’t git that. I declare I don’t know which people\r\ngive the most; the gintlemen give me more in wit wither, for then the\r\nladies, you see, can’t let their dresses out of their hands.\r\n\r\n“I am a Catholic, sir. I go to St. Pathrick’s sometimes, or I go to\r\nGordon-street Churruch. I don’t care which I go to--it’s all the same\r\nto me; but I haven’t been to churruch for months. I’ve nothing to\r\ncharge mysilf wid; and, indeed, I haven’t been to confission for some\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n“Tradespeople are very kind, indeed they are.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think I’ll go to Kint a hop-pickin’; and as for my crossin’,\r\nI lave it, sir, just as it is. I go five miles beyant Maidstone. I\r\nworruked fifteen years at Mr. ----; he was a pole-puller and binsman in\r\nthe hop-ground.\r\n\r\n“I’ve not been down there since the year before last. I was too poorly\r\nafter that accident. We make about eighteenpence, two shillin’s, or one\r\nshillin’, ’cording as the hops is good. No lodging nor fire to pay; and\r\nwe git plinty of good milk chape there. I manage thin to save a little\r\nmoney to hilp us in the winther.\r\n\r\n“I live in ---- street, Siven Dials; but I’m going to lave my son--we\r\ncan’t agree. We live in the two-pair back. I pay nothing a-week, only\r\nbring home ivery ha’penny to hilp thim. Sometimes I spind a pinny or\r\ntuppence out on mysilf.\r\n\r\n“My son is doin’ very badly. He sills fruit in the sthreets; but he’s\r\nniver been used to it before; and he has pains in his limbs with so\r\nmuch walking. He has no connixion, and with the sthrawbirries now he’s\r\nforrused to walk about of a night as will as a day, for they won’t keep\r\ntill the morrunning; they all go mouldy and bad. My son has been used\r\nto the bricklaying, sir: he can lit in a stove or a copper, or do a bit\r\nof plasther or lath, or the like. His wife is a very just, clane, sober\r\nwoman, and he has got three good childer; there is Catherine, who is\r\nnamed afther me, she is nearly five; Illen, two years and six months,\r\nnamed after her mother; and Margaret, the baby, six months ould--and\r\nshe is called afther my daughter, who is did.”\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE OCCASIONAL CROSSING-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUNDAY CROSSING-SWEEPER.\r\n\r\n“I’m a Sunday crossing-sweeper,” said an oyster-stall keeper, in\r\nanswer to my inquiries. “I mean by that, I only sweep a crossing on a\r\nSunday. I pitch in the Lorrimore-road, Newington, with a few oysters on\r\nweek-days, and I does jobs for the people about there, sich as cleaning\r\na few knives and forks, or shoes and boots, and windows. I’ve been in\r\nthe habit of sweeping a crossing about four or five years.\r\n\r\n“I never knowed my father, he died when I was a baby. He was a\r\n’terpreter, and spoke seven different languages. My father used to go\r\nwith Bonaparte’s army, and used to ’terpret for him. He died in the\r\nSouth of France. I had a brother, but he died quite a child, and my\r\nmother supported me and a sister by being cook in a gentleman’s family:\r\nwe was put out to nurse. My mother couldn’t afford to put me to school,\r\nand so I can’t read nor write. I’m forty-one years old.\r\n\r\n“The fust work I ever did was being boy at a pork-butcher’s. I used to\r\ntake out the meat wot was ordered. At last my master got broke up, and\r\nI was discharged from my place, and I took to sellin’ a few sprats. I\r\nhad no thoughts of taking to a crossing then. I was ten year old. I\r\nremember I give two shillings for a ‘shallow;’ that’s a flat basket\r\nwith two handles; they put ’em a top of ‘well-baskets,’ them as can\r\ncarry a good load. A well-basket’s almost like a coffin; it’s a long\r\nun like a shallow, on’y it’s a good deal deeper--about as deep as a\r\nwashin’ tub. I done very fair with my sprats till they got dear and\r\ncome up very small, so then I was obliged to get a few plaice, and\r\nthen I got a few baked ’taters and sold them. I hadn’t money enough\r\nto buy a tin--I could a got one for eight shillings--so I put ’em in\r\na cross-handle basket, and carried ’em round the streets, and into\r\npublic-houses, and cried ‘Baked taters, all hot!’ I used only to do\r\nthis of a night, and it brought me about four or five shillings a-week.\r\nI used to fill up the day by going round to gentlemen’s houses where\r\nI was known, to run for errands and clean knives and boots, and that\r\nbrought me sich a thing as four shillings a-week more altogether.\r\n\r\n“I never had no idea then of sweeping a crossing of a Sunday; but at\r\nlast I was obliged to push to it. I kept on like this for many years,\r\nand at last a gentleman named Mr. Jackson promised to buy me a tin, but\r\nhe died. My mother went blind through a blight; that was the cause of\r\nmy fust going out to work, and so I had to keep her; but I didn’t mind\r\nthat: I thought it was my duty so to do.\r\n\r\n“About ten years ago I got married; my wife used to go out washing\r\nand ironing. I thought two of us would get on better than one, and\r\nshe didn’t mind helpin’ me to keep my mother, for I was determined my\r\nmother shouldn’t go into the workhouse so long as I could help it.\r\n\r\n“A year or two after I got married, I found I must do something more to\r\nhelp to keep home, and then I fust thought of sweepin’ a crossing on\r\nSundays; so I bought a heath broom for twopence-ha’penny, and I pitched\r\nagin’ the Canterbury Arms, Kennington; it was between a baker’s shop\r\nand a public-house and butcher’s; they told me they’d all give me\r\nsomething if I’d sweep the crossing reg’lar.\r\n\r\n“The best places is in front of chapels and churches, ’cause you can\r\ntake more money in front of a church or a chapel than wot you can in a\r\nprivate road, ’cos they look at it more, and a good many thinks when\r\nyou sweeps in front of a public-house that you go and spend your money\r\ninside in waste.\r\n\r\n“The first Sunday I went at it, I took eighteenpence. I began at\r\nnine o’clock in the morning and stopped till four in the afternoon.\r\nThe publican give fourpence, and the baker sixpence, and the butcher\r\nthreepence, so that altogether I got above a half-crown. I stopped at\r\nthis crossing a year, and I always knocked up about two shillings or a\r\nhalf-crown on the Sunday. I very seldom got anythink from the ladies;\r\nit was most all give by the gentlemen. Little children used sometimes\r\nto give me ha’pence, but it was when their father give it to ’em; the\r\nlittle children like to do that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n“The way I come to leave this crossing was this here: the road was\r\nbeing repaired, and they shot down a lot of stones, so then I couldn’t\r\nsweep no crossing. I looked out for another place, and I went opposite\r\nthe Duke of Sutherland public-house in the Lorrimore-road. I swept\r\nthere one Sunday, and I got about one-and-sixpence. While I was\r\nsweeping this crossing, a gentleman comes up to me, and he axes me if\r\nI ever goes to chapel or church; and I tells him, ‘Yes;’ I goes to\r\nchurch, wot I’d been brought up to; and then he says, ‘You let me see\r\nyou at St. Michael’s Church, Brixton, and I’ll ’courage you, and you’ll\r\ndo better if you come up and sweep in front there of a Sunday instead\r\nof where you are; you’ll be sure to get more money, and get better\r\n’couraged. It don’t matter what you do,’ he says, ‘as long as it brings\r\nyou in a honest crust; anythink’s better than thieving.’ And then the\r\ngent gives me sixpence and goes away.\r\n\r\n“As soon as he’d gone I started off to his church, and got there just\r\nafter the people was all in. I left my broom in the churchyard. When I\r\ngot inside the church, I could see him a-sitten jest agin the communion\r\ntable, so I walks to the free seats and sets down right close again\r\nthe communion table myself, for his pew was on my right, and he saw\r\nme directly and looked and smiled at me. As he was coming out of the\r\nchurch he says, says he, ‘As long as I live, if you comes here on a\r\nSunday reg’lar I shall always ’courage you.’\r\n\r\n“The next Sunday I went up to the church and swept the crossing, and he\r\nsee me there, but he didn’t give me nothink till the church was over,\r\nand then he gave me a shilling, and the other people give me about\r\none-and-sixpence; so I got about two-and-sixpence altogether, and I\r\nthought that was a good beginning.\r\n\r\n“The next Sunday the gen’elman was ill, but he didn’t forget me. He\r\nsent me sixpence by his servant, and I got from the other people about\r\ntwo shillings more. I never see that gentleman after, for he died on\r\nthe Saturday. His wife sent for me on the Sunday; she was ill a-bed,\r\nand I see one of the daughters, and she gave me sixpence, and said I\r\nwas to be there on Monday morning. I went on the Monday, and the lady\r\nwas much worse, and I see the daughter again. She gave me a couple of\r\nshirts, and told me to come on the Friday, and when I went on that\r\nday I found the old lady was dead. The daughter gave me a coat, and\r\ntrousers, and waistcoat.\r\n\r\n“After the daughters had buried the father and mother they moved. I\r\nkept on sweeping at the church, till at last things got so bad that I\r\ncome away, for nobody give me nothink. The houses about there was so\r\ndamp that people wouldn’t live in ’em.\r\n\r\n“So then I come up into Lorrimore-road, and there I’ve been ever since.\r\nI don’t get on wonderful well there. Sometimes I don’t get above\r\nsixpence all day, but it’s mostly a shilling or so. The most I’ve took\r\nis about one-and-sixpence. The reason why I stop there is, because I’m\r\nknown there, you see. I stands there all the week selling highsters,\r\nand the people about there give me a good many jobs. Besides, the road\r\nis rather bad there, and they like to have a clean crossing of a Sunday.\r\n\r\n“I don’t get any more money in the winter (though it’s muddier) than\r\nI do in the summer; the reason is, ’cause there isn’t so many people\r\nstirring about in the winter as there is in the summer.\r\n\r\n“One broom will carry me over three Sundays, and I gives\r\ntwopence-ha’penny a-piece for ’em. Sometimes the people bring me\r\nout at my crossing--’specially in cold weather--a mug of hot tea\r\nand some bread and butter, or a bit of meat. I don’t know any other\r\ncrossing-sweeper; I never ’sociates with nobody. I always keeps my own\r\ncounsel, and likes my own company the best.\r\n\r\n“My wife’s been dead five months, and my mother six months; but I’ve\r\ngot a little boy seven year old; he stops at school all day till I go\r\nhome at night, and then I fetches him home. I mean to do something\r\nbetter with him than give him a broom: a good many people would set him\r\non a crossing; but I mean to keep him at school. I want to see him read\r\nand write well, because he’ll suit for a place then.\r\n\r\n“There’s some art in sweeping a crossing even. That is, you mustn’t\r\nsweep too hard, ’cos if you do, you wears a hole right in the road, and\r\nthen the water hangs in it. It’s the same as sweeping a path; if you\r\nsweeps too hard you wears up the stones.\r\n\r\n“To do it properly, you must put the end of the broom-handle in the\r\npalm of your right hand, and lay hold of it with your left, about\r\nhalfway down; then you takes half your crossing, and sweeps on one\r\nside till you gets over the road; then you turns round and comes back\r\ndoing the other half. Some people holds the broom before ’em, and keeps\r\nswaying it back’ards and for’ards to sweep the width of the crossing\r\nall in one stroke, but that ain’t sich a good plan, ’cause you’re apt\r\nto splash people that’s coming by; and besides, it wears the road in\r\nholes and wears out the broom so quick. I always use my broom steady. I\r\nnever splash nobody.\r\n\r\n“I never tried myself, but I’ve seen some crossin’-sweepers as could\r\ndo all manner of things in mud, sich as diamonds, and stars, and the\r\nmoon, and letters of the alphabet; and once in Oxford-street I see our\r\nSaviour on his cross in mud, and it was done well, too. The figure\r\nwasn’t done with the broom, it was done with a pointed piece of stick;\r\nit was a boy as I see doin’ it, about fifteen. He didn’t seem to take\r\nmuch money while I was a-looking at him.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I should a took to crossin’ sweeping if I hadn’t got\r\nmarried; but when I’d got a couple of children (for I’ve had a girl\r\ndie; if she’d lived she’d a been eight year old now,) I found I must do\r\na somethin’, and so I took to the broom.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_B. The Afflicted Crossing-Sweepers._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOODEN-LEGGED SWEEPER.\r\n\r\nThis man lives up a little court running out of a wide, second-rate\r\nstreet. It is a small court, consisting of some half-dozen houses, all\r\nof them what are called by courtesy “private.”\r\n\r\nI inquired at No. 3 for John ----; “The first-floor back, if you\r\nplease, sir;” and to the first-floor back I went.\r\n\r\nHere I was answered by a good-looking and intelligent young woman, with\r\na baby, who said her husband had not yet come home, but would I walk\r\nin and wait? I did so; and found myself in a very small, close room,\r\nwith a little furniture, which the man called “his few sticks,” and\r\npresently discovered another child--a little girl. The girl was very\r\nshy in her manner, being only two years and two months old, and as her\r\nmother said, very ailing from the difficulty of cutting her teeth,\r\nthough the true cause seemed to be want of proper nourishment and\r\nfresh air. The baby was a boy--a fine, cheerful, good-tempered little\r\nfellow, but rather pale, and with an unnaturally large forehead. The\r\nmantelpiece of the room was filled with little ornaments of various\r\nsorts, such as bead-baskets, and over them hung a series of black\r\nprofiles--not portraits of either the crossing-sweeper or any of his\r\nfamily, but an odd lot of heads, which had lost their owners many a\r\nyear, and served, in company with a little red, green, and yellow\r\nscripture-piece, to keep the wall from looking bare. Over the door\r\n(inside the room) was nailed a horse-shoe, which, the wife told me,\r\nhad been put there by her husband, for luck.\r\n\r\nA bed, two deal tables, a couple of boxes, and three chairs, formed\r\nthe entire furniture of the room, and nearly filled it. On the\r\nwindow-frame was hung a small shaving-glass; and on the two boxes\r\nstood a wicker-work apology for a perambulator, in which I learnt the\r\npoor crippled man took out his only daughter at half-past four in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n“If some people was to see that, sir,” said the sweeper, when he\r\nentered and saw me looking at it, “they would, and in fact they _do_\r\nsay, ‘Why, you can’t be in want.’ Ah! little they know how we starved\r\nand pinched ourselves before we could get it.”\r\n\r\nThere was a fire in the room, notwithstanding the day was very hot;\r\nbut the window was wide open, and the place tolerably ventilated,\r\nthough oppressive. I have been in many poor people’s “places,” but\r\nnever remember one so poor in its appointments and yet so _free_ from\r\neffluvia.\r\n\r\nThe crossing-sweeper himself was a very civil sort of man, and in\r\nanswer to my inquiries said:--\r\n\r\n“I know that I do as I ought to, and so I don’t feel hurt at standing\r\nat my crossing. I have been there four years. I found the place vacant.\r\nMy wife, though she looks very well, will never be able to do any hard\r\nwork; so we sold our mangle, and I took to the crossing: but we’re not\r\nin debt, and nobody can’t say nothing to us. I like to go along the\r\nstreets free of such remarks as is made by people to whom you owes\r\nmoney. I had a mangle in ---- Yard, but through my wife’s weakness I\r\nwas forced to part with it. I was on the crossing a short time before\r\nthat, for I knew that if I parted with my mangle and things before I\r\nknew whether I could get a living at the crossing I couldn’t get my\r\nmangle back again.\r\n\r\n“We sold the mangle only for a sovereign, and we gave two-pound-ten\r\nfor it; we sold it to the same man that we bought it of. About six\r\nmonths ago I managed for to screw and save enough to buy that little\r\nwicker chaise, for I can’t carry the children because of my one leg,\r\nand of course the mother can’t carry them both out together. There was\r\na man had the crossing I’ve got; he died three or four years before I\r\ntook it; but he didn’t depend on the crossing--he did things for the\r\ntradespeople about, such as carpet-beating, messages, and so on.\r\n\r\n“When I first took the crossing I did very well. It happened to be a\r\nvery nasty, dirty season, and I took a good deal of money. Sweepers are\r\nnot always civil, sir.\r\n\r\n“I wish I had gone to one of the squares, though. But I think after\r\n---- street is paved with stone I shall do better. I am certain I never\r\ntaste a bit of meat from one week’s end to the other. The best day I\r\never made was five-and-sixpence or six shillings; it was the winter\r\nbefore last. If you remember, the snow laid very thick on the ground,\r\nand the sudden thaw made walking so uncomfortable, that I did very\r\nwell. I have taken as little as sixpence, fourpence, and even twopence.\r\nLast Thursday I took two ha’pence all day. Take one week with the\r\nother, seven or eight shillings is the very outside.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how it is, but some people who used to give me a penny,\r\ndon’t now. The boys who come in wet weather earn a great deal more\r\nthan I do. I once lost a good chance, sir, at the corner of the street\r\nleading to Cavendish-square. There’s a bank, and they pay a man seven\r\nshillings a-week to sweep the crossing: a butcher in Oxford Market\r\nspoke for me; but when I went up, it unfortunately turned out that I\r\nwas not fit, from the loss of my leg. The last man they had there they\r\nwere obliged to turn away--he was so given to drink.\r\n\r\n“I think there are some rich crossing-sweepers in the city, about\r\nthe Exchange; but you won’t find them now during this dry weather,\r\nexcept in by-places. In wet weather, there are two or three boys who\r\nsweep near my crossing, and take all my earnings away. There’s a great\r\nable-bodied man besides--a fellow strong enough to follow the plough.\r\nI said to the policeman, ‘Now, ain’t this a shame?’ and the policeman\r\nsaid, ‘Well, _he_ must get his living as well as you.’ I’m always\r\ncivil to the police, and they’re always civil to me--in fact, I think\r\nsometimes I’m too civil--I’m not rough enough with people.\r\n\r\n“You soon tell whether to have any hopes of people coming across. I can\r\ntell a gentleman directly I see him.\r\n\r\n“Where I stand, sir, I could get people in trouble everlasting; there’s\r\nall sorts of thieving going on. I saw the other day two or three\r\nrespectable persons take a purse out of an old lady’s pocket before\r\nthe baker’s shop at the corner; but I can’t say a word, or they would\r\ncome and throw me into the road. If a gentleman gives me sixpence, he\r\ndon’t give me any more for three weeks or a month; but I don’t think\r\nI’ve more than three or four gentlemen as gives me that. Well, you can\r\nscarcely tell the gentleman from the clerk, the clerks are such great\r\nswells now.\r\n\r\n“Lawyers themselves dress very plain; those great men who don’t come\r\nevery day, because they’ve clerks to do their business for them, they\r\ngive most. People hardly ever stop to speak unless it is to ask you\r\nwhere places are--you might be occupied at that all day. I manage to\r\npay my rent out of what I take on Sunday, but not lately--this weather\r\nreligious people go pleasuring.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t go now--the fact is, I’d like to go to church, if I could,\r\nbut when I come home I am tired; but I’ve got books here, and they do\r\nas well, sir. I read a little and write a little.\r\n\r\n“I lost my leg through a swelling--there was no chloroform then. I\r\nwas in the hospital three years and a half, and was about fifteen or\r\nsixteen when I had it off. I always feel the sensation of the foot,\r\nand more so at change of weather. I feel my toes moving about, and\r\neverything; sometimes, it’s just as if the calf of my leg was itching.\r\nI _feel_ the rain coming; when I see a cloud coming my leg shoots, and\r\nI know we shall have rain.\r\n\r\n“My mother was a laundress--my father has been dead nineteen years my\r\nlast birthday. My mother was subject to fits, so I was forced to stop\r\nat home to take care of the business.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to get on better, but I always think, if sickness or\r\nanything comes on----\r\n\r\n“I am at my crossing at half-past eight; at half-past eleven I come\r\nhome to dinner. I go back at one or two till seven.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I mind horses and carts, but the boys get all that business.\r\nOne of these little customers got sixpence the other day for only\r\nopening the door of a cab. I don’t know how it is they let these little\r\nboys be about; if I was the police, I wouldn’t allow it.\r\n\r\n“I think it’s a blessing, having children--(referring to his little\r\ngirl)--that child wants the gravy of meat, or an egg beaten up, but\r\nshe can’t get it. I take her out every morning round Euston-square and\r\nthose open places. I get out about half-past four. It is early, but if\r\nit benefits her, that’s no odds.”\r\n\r\nONE-LEGGED SWEEPER AT CHANCERY-LANE.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what induced me to take that crossing, except it was that\r\nno one was there, and the traffic was so good--fact is, the traffic is\r\ntoo good, and people won’t stop as they cross over, they’re very glad\r\nto get out of the way of the cabs and the omnibuses.\r\n\r\n“Tradespeople never give me anything--not even a bit of bread. The\r\nonly thing I get is a few cuttings, such as crusts of sandwiches and\r\nremains of cheese, from the public-house at the corner of the court.\r\nThe tradespeople are as distant to me now as they were when I came, but\r\nif I should pitch up a tale I should soon get acquainted with them.\r\n\r\n“We have lived in this lodging two years and a half, and we pay\r\none-and-ninepence a-week, as you may see from the rent-book, and that I\r\nmanage to earn on Sundays. We owe four weeks now, and, thank God, it’s\r\nno more.\r\n\r\n“I was born, sir, in ---- street, Berkeley-square, at Lord ----’s\r\nhouse, when my mother was minding the house. I have been used to London\r\nall my life, but not to this part; I have always been at the west-end,\r\nwhich is what I call the best end.\r\n\r\n“I did not like the idea of crossing-sweeping at first, till I reasoned\r\nwith myself, Why should I mind? I’m not doing any hurt to anybody. I\r\ndon’t care at all now--I know I’m doing what I ought to do.\r\n\r\n“A man had better be killed out of the way than be disabled. It’s not\r\npleasant to know that my wife is suckling that great child, and, though\r\nshe is so weakly, she can’t get no meat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ONE-LEGGED SWEEPER AT CHANCERY-LANE.\r\n\r\n[_From a Photograph._]]\r\n\r\n“I’ve been knocked down twice, sir--both times by cabs. The last time\r\nit was a fortnight before I could get about comfortably again. The fool\r\nof a fellow was coming along, not looking at his horse, but talking\r\nto somebody on the cab-rank. The place was as free as this room, if\r\nhe had only been looking before him. Nobody hollered till I was down,\r\nbut plenty hollered then. Ah, I often notice such carelessness--it’s\r\nreally shameful. I don’t think those ‘shofuls’ (Hansoms) should be\r\nallowed--the fact is, if the driver is not a tall man he can’t see his\r\nhorse’s head.\r\n\r\n“A nasty place is end of ---- street: it narrows so suddenly. There’s\r\nmore confusion and more bother about it than any place in London. When\r\ntwo cabs gets in at once, one one way and one the other, there’s sure\r\nto be a row to know which was the first in.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOST SEVERELY-AFFLICTED OF ALL THE CROSSING-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\nPassing the dreary portico of the Queen’s Theatre, and turning to the\r\nright down Tottenham Mews, we came upon a flight of steps leading up\r\nto what is called “The Gallery,” where an old man, gasping from the\r\neffects of a lung disease, and feebly polishing some old harness,\r\nproclaimed himself the father of the sweeper I was in search of, and\r\nushered me into the room where he lay a-bed, having had a “very bad\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nThe room itself was large and of a low pitch, stretching over some\r\nstables; it was very old and creaky (the sweeper called, it “an old\r\nwilderness”), and contained, in addition to two turn-up bedsteads, that\r\ncurious medley of articles which, in the course of years, an old and\r\npoor couple always manage to gather up. There was a large lithograph\r\nof a horse, dear to the remembrance of the old man from an indication\r\nof a dog in the corner. “The very spit of the one I had for years;\r\nit’s a real portrait, sir, for Mr. Hanbart, the printer, met me one\r\nday and sketched him.” There was an etching of Hogarth’s in a black\r\nframe; a stuffed bird in a wooden case, with a glass before it; a piece\r\nof painted glass, hanging in a place of honour, but for which no name\r\ncould be remembered, excepting that it was “of the old-fashioned sort.”\r\nThere were the odd remnants, too, of old china ornaments, but very\r\nlittle furniture; and, finally, a kitten.\r\n\r\nThe father, worn out and consumptive, had been groom to Lord\r\nCombermere. “I was with him, sir, when he took Bonyparte’s house at\r\nMalmasong. I could have had a pension then if I’d a liked, but I was\r\nyoung and foolish, and had plenty of money, and we never know what we\r\nmay come to.”\r\n\r\nThe sweeper, although a middle-aged man, had all the appearance of\r\na boy--his raw-looking eyes, which he was always wiping with a piece\r\nof linen rag, gave him a forbidding expression, which his shapeless,\r\nshort, bridgeless nose tended to increase. But his manners and habits\r\nwere as simple in their character as those of a child; and he spoke of\r\nhis father’s being angry with him for not getting up before, as if he\r\nwere a little boy talking of his nurse.\r\n\r\nHe walks, with great difficulty, by the help of a crutch; and the sight\r\nof his weak eyes, his withered limb, and his broken shoulder (his old\r\nhelpless mother, and his gasping, almost inaudible father,) form a most\r\npainful subject for compassion.\r\n\r\nThe crossing-sweeper gave me, with no little meekness and some slight\r\nintelligence, the following statement:--\r\n\r\n“I very seldom go out on a crossin’ o’ Sundays. I didn’t do much good\r\nat it. I used to go to church of a Sunday--in fact, I do now when I’m\r\nwell enough.\r\n\r\n“It’s fifteen year next January since I left Regent-street. I was there\r\nthree years, and then I went on Sundays occasionally. Sometimes I\r\nused to get a shilling, but I have given it up now--it didn’t answer;\r\nbesides, a lady who was kind to me found me out, and said she wouldn’t\r\ndo any more for me if I went out on Sundays. She’s been dead these\r\nthree or four years now.\r\n\r\n“When I was at Regent-street I might have made twelve shillings a-week,\r\nor something thereabout.\r\n\r\n“I am seven-and-thirty the 26th day of last month, and I have been lame\r\nsix-and-twenty years. My eyes have been bad ever since my birth. The\r\nscrofulous disease it was that lamed me--it come with a swelling on the\r\nknee, and the outside wound broke about the size of a crown piece, and\r\na piece of bone come from it; then it gathered in the inside and at the\r\ntop. I didn’t go into the hospital then, but I was an out-patient, for\r\nthe doctor said a close confined place wouldn’t do me no good. He said\r\nthat the seaside would, though; but my parents couldn’t afford to send\r\nme, and that’s how it is. I _did_ go to Brighton and Margate nine years\r\nafter my leg was bad, but it was too late then.\r\n\r\n“I have been in Middlesex Hospital, with a broken collar-bone, when I\r\nwas knocked down by a cab. I was in a fortnight there, and I was in\r\nagain when I hurt my leg. I was sweeping my crossin’ when the top came\r\noff my crutch. I fell back’ards, and my leg doubled under me. They had\r\nto carry me there.\r\n\r\n“I went into the Middlesex Hospital for my eyes and leg. I was in a\r\nmonth, but they wouldn’t keep me long, there’s no cure for me.\r\n\r\n“My leg is very painful, ’specially at change of weather. Sometimes\r\nI don’t get an hour’s sleep of a night--it was daylight this morning\r\nbefore I closed my eyes.\r\n\r\n“I went on the crossing first because my parents couldn’t keep me, not\r\nbeing able to keep theirselves. I thought it was the best thing I could\r\ndo, but it’s like all other things, it’s got very bad now. I used to\r\nmanage to rub along at first--the streets have got shockin’ bad of late.\r\n\r\n“To tell the truth, I was turned away from Regent-street by Mr. Cook,\r\nthe furrier, corner of Argyle Street. I’ll tell you as far as I was\r\ntold. He called me into his passage one night, and said I must look out\r\nfor another crossin’, for a lady, who was a very good customer of his,\r\nrefused to come while I was there; my heavy afflictions was such that\r\nshe didn’t like the look of me. I said, ‘Very well;’ but because I come\r\nthere next day and the day after that, he got the policeman to turn\r\nme away. Certainly the policeman acted very kindly, but he said the\r\ngentleman wanted me removed, and I must find another crossing.\r\n\r\n“Then I went down Charlotte-street, opposite Percy Chapel, at the\r\ncorner of Windmill-street. After that I went to Wells-street, by\r\ngetting permission of the doctor at the corner. He thought that it\r\nwould be better for me than Charlotte-street, so he let me come.\r\n\r\n“Ah! there ain’t so many crossing-sweepers as there was; I think\r\nthey’ve done away with a great many of them.\r\n\r\n“When I first went to Wells-street, I did pretty well, because there\r\nwas a dress-maker’s at the corner, and I used to get a good deal from\r\nthe carriages that stopped before the door. I used to take five or six\r\nshillings in a day then, and I don’t take so much in a week now. I tell\r\nyou what I made this week. I’ve made one-and-fourpence, but it’s been\r\nso wet, and people are out of town; but, of course, it’s not always\r\nalike--sometimes I get three-and-sixpence or four shillings. Some\r\npeople gives me a sixpence or a fourpenny-bit; I reckons that all in.\r\n\r\n“I am dreadful tired when I comes home of a night. Thank God my other\r\nleg’s all right! I wish the t’other was as strong, but it never will be\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n“The police never try to turn me away; they’re very friendly, they’ll\r\npass the time of day with me, or that, from knowing me so long in\r\nOxford-street.\r\n\r\n“My broom sometimes serves me a month; of course, they don’t last long\r\nnow it’s showery weather. I give twopence-halfpenny a piece for ’em, or\r\nthreepence.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know who gives me the most; my eyes are so bad I can’t see. I\r\nthink, though, upon an average, the gentlemen give most.\r\n\r\n“Often I hear the children, as they are going by, ask their mothers for\r\nsomething to give to me; but they only say, ‘Come along--come along!’\r\nIt’s very rare that they lets the children have a ha’penny to give me.\r\n\r\n“My mother is seventy the week before next Christmas. She can’t do much\r\nnow; she does though go out on Wednesdays or Saturdays, but that’s to\r\npeople she’s known for years who is attached to her. She does her work\r\nthere just as she likes.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes she gets a little washing--sometimes not. This week she had\r\na little, and was forced to dry it indoors; but that makes ’em half\r\ndirty again.\r\n\r\n“My father’s breath is so bad that he can’t do anything except little\r\nodd jobs for people down here; but they’ve got the knack now, a good\r\nmany on ’em, of doin’ their own.\r\n\r\n“We have lived here fifteen years next September; it’s a long time to\r\nlive in such an old wilderness, but my old mother is a sort of woman\r\nas don’t like movin’ about, and I don’t like it. Some people are\r\neverlasting on the move.\r\n\r\n“When I’m not on my crossin’ I sit poking at home, or make a job of\r\nmending my clothes. I mended these trousers in two or three places.\r\n\r\n“It’s all done by feel, sir. My mother says it’s a good thing we’ve got\r\nour feeling at least, if we haven’t got our eyesight.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO CROSSING-SWEEPER, WHO HAD LOST BOTH HIS LEGS.\r\n\r\nThis man sweeps a crossing in a principal and central thoroughfare when\r\nthe weather is cold enough to let him walk; the colder the better,\r\nhe says, as it “numbs his stumps like.” He is unable to follow this\r\noccupation in warm weather, as his legs feel “just like corns,” and\r\nhe cannot walk more than a mile a-day. Under these circumstances he\r\ntakes to begging, which he thinks he has a perfect right to do, as he\r\nhas been left destitute in what is to him almost a strange country,\r\nand has been denied what he terms “his rights.” He generally sits\r\nwhile begging, dressed in a sailor shirt and trousers, with a black\r\nneckerchief round his neck, tied in the usual nautical knot. He places\r\nbefore him the placard which is given beneath, and never moves a muscle\r\nfor the purpose of soliciting charity. He always appears scrupulously\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nI went to see him at his home early one morning--in fact, at\r\nhalf-past eight, but he was not then up. I went again at nine, and\r\nfound him prepared for my visit in a little parlour, in a dirty and\r\nrather disreputable alley running out of a court in a street near\r\nBrunswick-square. The negro’s parlour was scantily furnished with\r\ntwo chairs, a turn-up bedstead, and a sea-chest. A few odds and ends\r\nof crockery stood on the sideboard, and a kettle was singing over\r\na cheerful bit of fire. The little man was seated on a chair, with\r\nhis stumps of legs sticking straight out. He showed some amount of\r\nintelligence in answering my questions. We were quite alone, for he\r\nsent his wife and child--the former a pleasant-looking “half-caste,”\r\nand the latter the cheeriest little crowing, smiling “piccaninny” I\r\nhave ever seen--he sent them out into the alley, while I conversed with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHis life is embittered by the idea that he has never yet had “his\r\nrights”--that the owners of the ship in which his legs were burnt\r\noff have not paid him his wages (of which, indeed, he says, he never\r\nreceived any but the five pounds which he had in advance before\r\nstarting), and that he has been robbed of 42_l._ by a grocer in\r\nGlasgow. How true these statements may be it is almost impossible to\r\nsay, but from what he says, some injustice seems to have been done him\r\nby the canny Scotchman, who refuses him his “pay,” without which he is\r\ndetermined “never to leave the country.”\r\n\r\n“I was on that crossing,” he said, “almost the whole of last winter. It\r\nwas very cold, and I had nothing at all to do; so, as I passed there,\r\nI asked the gentleman at the baccer-shop, as well as the gentleman at\r\nthe office, and I asked at the boot-shop, too, if they would let me\r\nsweep there. The policeman wanted to turn me away, but I went to the\r\ngentleman inside the office, and he told the policeman to leave me\r\nalone. The policeman said first, ‘You must go away,’ but I said, ‘I\r\ncouldn’t do anything else, and he ought to think it a charity to let me\r\nstop.’\r\n\r\n“I don’t stop in London very long, though, at a time; I go to Glasgow,\r\nin Scotland, where the owners of the ship in which my legs were burnt\r\noff live. I served nine years in the merchant service and the navy. I\r\nwas born in Kingston, in Jamaica; it is an English place, sir, so I am\r\ncounted as not a foreigner. I’m different from them Lascars. I went to\r\nsea when I was only nine years old. The owners is in London who had\r\nthat ship. I was cabin-boy; and after I had served my time I became\r\ncook, or when I couldn’t get the place of cook I went before the mast.\r\nI went as head cook in 1851, in the _Madeira_ barque; she used to be a\r\nWest Indy trader, and to trade out when I belonged to her. We got down\r\nto 69 south of Cape Horn; and there we got almost froze and perished to\r\ndeath. That is the book what I sell.”\r\n\r\nThe “Book” (as he calls it) consists of eight pages, printed on paper\r\nthe size of a sheet of note paper; it is entitled--\r\n\r\n “BRIEF SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF\r\n\r\n EDWARD ALBERT!\r\n\r\n A native of Kingston, Jamaica.\r\n\r\n Showing the hardships he underwent and the sufferings he endured in\r\n having both legs amputated.\r\n\r\n HULL:\r\n\r\n W. HOWE, PRINTER.”\r\n\r\nIt is embellished with a portrait of a black man, which has evidently\r\nbeen in its time a comic “nigger” of the Jim-Crow tobacco-paper kind,\r\nas is evidenced by the traces of a tobacco-pipe, which has been\r\nunskilfully erased.\r\n\r\nThe “Book” itself is concocted from an affidavit made by Edward Albert\r\nbefore “P. Mackinlay, Esq., one of Her Majesty’s Justices of the Peace\r\nfor the country (so it is printed) of Lanark.”\r\n\r\nI have seen the affidavit, and it is almost identical with the\r\nstatement in the “book,” excepting in the matter of grammar, which has\r\nrather suffered on its road to Mr. Howe, the printer.\r\n\r\nThe following will give an idea of the matter of which it is composed:--\r\n\r\n “In February, 1851, I engaged to serve as cook on board the barque\r\n _Madeira_, of Glasgow, Captain J. Douglas, on her voyage from\r\n Glasgow to California, thence to China, and thence home to a port of\r\n discharge in the United Kingdom. I signed articles, and delivered up\r\n my register-ticket as a British seaman, as required by law. I entered\r\n the service on board the said vessel, under the said engagement, and\r\n sailed with that vessel on the 18th of February, 1851. I discharged\r\n my duty as cook on board the said vessel, from the date of its having\r\n left the Clyde, until June the same year, in which month the vessel\r\n rounded Cape Horne, at that time my legs became frost bitten, and I\r\n became in consequence unfit for duty.\r\n\r\n “In the course of the next day after my limbs became affected, the\r\n master of the vessel, and mate, took me to the ship’s oven, in order,\r\n as they said, to cure me; the oven was hot at the time, a fowl that\r\n was roasting therein having been removed in order to make room for my\r\n feet, which was put into the oven; in consequence of the treatment, my\r\n feet burst through the intense swelling, and mortification ensued.\r\n\r\n “The vessel called, six weeks after, at Valpariso, and I was there\r\n taken to an hospital, where I remained five months and a half. Both my\r\n legs were amputated three inches below my knees soon after I went to\r\n the hospital at Valpariso. I asked my master for my wages due to me,\r\n for my service on board the vessel, and demanded my register-ticket;\r\n when the captain told me I should not recover, that the vessel could\r\n not wait for me, and that I was a dead man, and that he could not\r\n discharge a dead man; and that he also said, that as I had no friends\r\n there to get my money, he would only put a little money into the\r\n hands of the consul, which would be applied in burying me. On being\r\n discharged from the hospital I called on the consul, and was informed\r\n by him that master had not left any money.\r\n\r\n “I was afterwards taken on board one of her Majesty’s ships, the\r\n _Driver_, Captain Charles Johnston, and landed at Portsmouth; from\r\n thence I got a passage to Glasgow, ware I remained three months.\r\n Upon supplication to the register-office for seamen, in London, my\r\n register-ticket has been forwarded to the Collector of Customs,\r\n Glasgow; and he is ready to deliver it to me upon obtaining the\r\n authority of the Justices of the Peace, and I recovered the same under\r\n the 22nd section of the General Merchant Seaman’s Act. Declares I\r\n cannot write.\r\n\r\n  “(Signed)        DAVID MACKINLAY, J. P.\r\n\r\n “The Justices having considered the foregoing information and\r\n declaration, finds that Edward Albert, therein named the last-register\r\n ticket, sought to be covered under circumstances which, so far as\r\n he was concerned, were unavoidable, and that no fraud was intended\r\n or committed by him in reference thereto, therefore authorised the\r\n Collector and Comptroller of Customs at the port of Glasgow to deliver\r\n to the said Edward Albert the register-ticket, sought to be recovered\r\n by him all in terms of 22nd section of the General Merchant Seamen’s\r\n Act.\r\n\r\n  “(Signed)      DAVID MACKINLAY, J. P.\r\n\r\n “Glasgow, Oct. 6th, 1852.\r\n\r\n “Register Ticket, No. 512, 652, age 25 years.”\r\n\r\n“I could make a large book of my sufferings, sir, if I liked,” he said,\r\n“and I will disgrace the owners of that ship as long as they don’t give\r\nme what they owe me.\r\n\r\n“I will never leave England or Scotland until I get my rights; but\r\nthey says money makes money, and if I had money I could get it. If\r\nthey would only give me what they owe me, I wouldn’t ask anybody for a\r\nfarthing, God knows, sir. I don’t know why the master put my feet in\r\nthe oven; he said to cure me: the agony of pain I was in was such, he\r\nsaid, that it must be done.\r\n\r\n“The loss of my limbs is bad enough, but it’s still worse when you\r\ncan’t get what is your rights, nor anything for the sweat that they\r\nworked out of me.\r\n\r\n“After I went down to Glasgow for my money I opened a little\r\ncoffee-house; it was called ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin.’ I did very well. The\r\nman who sold me tea and coffee said he would get me on, and I had\r\nbetter give my money to him to keep safe, and he used to put it away\r\nin a tin box which I had given four-and-sixpence for. He advertised my\r\nplace in the papers, and I did a good business. I had the place open a\r\nmonth, when he kept all my savings--two-and-forty pounds--and shut up\r\nthe place, and denied me of it, and I never got a farthing.\r\n\r\n“I declare to you I can’t describe the agony I felt when my legs were\r\nburst; I fainted away over and over again. There was four men came; I\r\nwas lying in my hammock, and they moved the fowl that was roasting,\r\nand put my legs in the oven. There they held me for ten minutes. They\r\nsaid, it would take the cold out; but after I came out the cold caught\r\n’em again, and the next day they swole up as big round as a pillar, and\r\nburst, and then like water come out. No man but God knows what I have\r\nsuffered and went through.\r\n\r\n“By the order of the doctor at Valparaiso, the sick patients had to\r\ncome out of the room I went into; the smell was so bad I couldn’t\r\nbear it myself--it was all mortification--they had to use chloride\r\no’ zinc to keep the smell down. They tried to save one leg, but the\r\nmortification was getting up into my body. I got better after my legs\r\nwere off.\r\n\r\n“I was three months good before I could turn, or able to lift up my\r\nhand to my head. I was glad to move after that time, it was a regular\r\nrelief to me; if it wasn’t for good attendance, I should not have\r\nlived. You know they don’t allow tobaccer in a hospital, but I had it;\r\nit was the only thing I cared for. The Reverend Mr. Armstrong used to\r\nbring me a pound a fortnight; he used to bring it regular. I never used\r\nto smoke before; they said I never should recover, but after I got the\r\ntobaccer it seemed to soothe me. I was five months and a half in that\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n“Admiral Moseley, of the _Thetis_ frigate, sent me home; and the reason\r\nwhy he sent me home was, that after I came well, I called on Mr.\r\nRouse, the English consul, and he sent me to the boarding-house, till\r\nsuch time as he could find a ship to send me home in. I was there about\r\ntwo months, and the boarding-master, Jan Pace, sent me to the consul.\r\n\r\n“I used to get about a little, with two small crutches, and I also had\r\na little cart before that, on three wheels; it was made by a man in the\r\nhospital. I used to lash myself down in it. That was the best thing I\r\never had--I could get about best in that.\r\n\r\n“Well, I went to the consul, and when I went to him, he says, ‘I can’t\r\npay your board; you must beg and pay for it;’ so I went and told Jan\r\nPace, and he said, ‘If you had stopped here a hundred years, I would\r\nnot turn you out;’ and then I asked Pace to tell me where the Admiral\r\nlived. ‘What do you want with him?’ says he. I said, ‘I think the\r\nAdmiral must be higher than the consul.’ Pace slapped me on the back.\r\nSays he, ‘I’m glad to see you’ve got the pluck to complain to the\r\nAdmiral.’\r\n\r\n“I went down at nine o’clock the next morning, to see the Admiral. He\r\nsaid, ‘Well, Prince Albert, how are you getting on?’ So I told him I\r\nwas getting on very bad; and then I told him all about the consul; and\r\nhe said, as long as he stopped he would see me righted, and took me on\r\nboard his ship, the _Thetis_; and he wrote to the consul, and said to\r\nme, ‘If the consul sends for you, don’t you go to him; tell him you\r\nhave no legs to walk, and he must walk to you.’\r\n\r\n“The consul wanted to send me back in a merchant ship, but the Admiral\r\nwouldn’t have it, so I came in the _Driver_, one of Her Majesty’s\r\nvessels. It was the 8th of May, 1852, when I got to Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n“I stopped a little while--about a week--in Portsmouth. I went to the\r\nAdmiral of the dockyard, and he told me I must go to the Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon. So I paid my passage to London, saw the Lord Mayor, who sent\r\nme to Mr. Yardley, the magistrate, and he advertised the case for me,\r\nand I got four pounds fifteen shillings, besides my passage to Glasgow.\r\nAfter I got there, I went to Mr. Symee a Custom-house officer (he’d\r\nbeen in the same ship with me to California); he said, ‘Oh, gracious,\r\nEdward, how have you lost your limbs!’ and I burst out a crying. I told\r\nhim all about it. He advised me to go to the owner. I went there; but\r\nthe policeman in London had put my name down as Robert Thorpe, which\r\nwas the man I lodged with; so they denied me.\r\n\r\n“I went to the shipping office, where they reckonised me; and I went\r\nto Mr. Symee again, and he told me to go before the Lord Mayor (a Lord\r\nProvost they call him in Scotland), and make an affidavit; and so, when\r\nthey found my story was right, they sent to London for my seaman’s\r\nticket; but they couldn’t do anything, because the captain was not\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“When I got back to London, I commenced sweeping the crossin’, sir. I\r\nonly sweep it in the winter, because I can’t stand in the summer. Oh,\r\nyes, I feel my feet still: it is just as if I had them sitting on the\r\nfloor, now. I feel my toes moving, like as if I had ’em. I could count\r\nthem, the whole ten, whenever I work my knees. I had a corn on one of\r\nmy toes, and I can feel it still, particularly at the change of weather.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I might get two shillings a-day at my crossing, sometimes\r\none shilling and sixpence, sometimes I don’t take above sixpence. The\r\nmost I ever made in one day was three shillings and sixpence, but\r\nthat’s very seldom.\r\n\r\n“I am a very steady man. I don’t drink what money I get; and if I had\r\nthe means to get something to do, I’d keep off the streets.\r\n\r\n“When I offered to go to the parish, they told me to go to Scotland, to\r\nspite the men who owed me my wages.\r\n\r\n“Many people tell me I ought to go to my country; but I tell them it’s\r\nvery hard--I didn’t come here without my legs--I lost them, as it were,\r\nin this country; but if I had lost them in my own country, I should\r\nhave been better off. I should have gone down to the magistrate every\r\nFriday, and have taken my ten shillings.\r\n\r\n“I went to the Merchant Seaman’s Fund, and they said that those who\r\ngot hurted before 1852 have been getting the funds, but those who were\r\nhurted after 1852 couldn’t get nothing--it was stopped in ’51, and the\r\nmerchants wouldn’t pay any more, and don’t pay any more.\r\n\r\n“That’s scandalous, because, whether you’re willing or not, you must\r\npay two shillings a-month (one shilling a-month for the hospital fees,\r\nand one shilling a-month to the Merchant Seaman’s Fund), out of your\r\npay.\r\n\r\n“I am married: my wife is the same colour as me, but an Englishwoman.\r\nI’ve been married two years. I married her from where she belonged, in\r\nLeeds. I couldn’t get on to do anything without her. Sometimes she goes\r\nout and sells things--fruit, and so on--but she don’t make much. With\r\nthe assistance of my wife, if I could get my money, I would set up in\r\nthe same line of business as before, in a coffee-shop. If I had three\r\npounds I could do it: it took well in Scotland. I am not a common cook,\r\neither; I am a pastrycook. I used to make all the sorts of cakes they\r\nhave in the shops. I bought the shapes, and tins, and things to make\r\nthem proper.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you how I did--there was a kind of apparatus; it boils water\r\nand coffee, and the milk and the tea, in different departments; but you\r\ncouldn’t see the divisions--the pipes all ran into one tap, like. I’ve\r\nhad a sixpence and a shilling for people to look at it: it cost me two\r\npound ten.\r\n\r\n“Even if I had a coffee-stall down at Covent-garden, I should do; and,\r\nbesides, I understand the making of eel-soup. I have one child,--it is\r\njust three months and a week old. It is a boy, and we call it James\r\nEdward Albert. James is after my grandfather, who was a slave.\r\n\r\n“I was a little boy when the slaves in Jamaica got their freedom: the\r\npeople were very glad to be free; they do better since, I know, because\r\nsome of them have got property, and send their children to school.\r\nThere’s more Christianity there than there is here. The public-house is\r\nclose shut on Saturday night, and not opened till Monday morning. No\r\nfruit is allowed to be sold in the street. I am a Protestant. I don’t\r\nknow the name of the church, but I goes down to a new-built church,\r\nnear King’s-cross. I never go in, because of my legs; but I just go\r\ninside the door; and sometimes when I don’t go, I read the Testament\r\nI’ve got here: in all my sickness I took care of that.\r\n\r\n“There are a great many Irish in this place. I would like to get away\r\nfrom it, for it is a very disgraceful place,--it is an awful, awful\r\nplace altogether. I haven’t been in it very long, and I want to get out\r\nof it; it is not fit.\r\n\r\n“I pay one-and-sixpence rent. If you don’t go out and drink and carouse\r\nwith them, they don’t like it; they make use of bad language--they\r\nchaff me about my misfortune--they call me ‘Cripple;’ some says ‘Uncle\r\nTom,’ and some says ‘Nigger;’ but I never takes no notice of ’em at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is a verbatim copy of the placard which the poor fellow\r\nplaces before him when he begs.

He has lost one leg (from the knee) by a fall from\r\na scaffold, while working as a bricklayer’s labourer in Wales, some\r\nsix years ago; and speaks bitterly of the hard time he had of it when\r\nhe first came to London, and hobbled about selling matches. He says he\r\nis thirty-six, but looks more than fifty; and his face has the ghastly\r\nexpression of death. He wears the ordinary close cloth street-cap and\r\ncorduroy trousers. Even during the warm weather he wears an upper\r\ncoat--a rough thick garment, fit for the Arctic regions. It was very\r\ndifficult to make him understand my object in getting information from\r\nhim: he thought that he had nothing to tell, and laid great stress upon\r\nthe fact of his never keeping “count” of anything.\r\n\r\nHe accounted for his miserably small income by stating that he was an\r\ninvalid--“now and thin continually.” He said--\r\n\r\n“I can’t say how long I have been on this crossin’; I think about five\r\nyear. When I came on it there had been no one here before. No one\r\ninterferes with me at all, at all. I niver hard of a crossin’ bein’\r\nsould; but I don’t know any other sweepers. I makes no fraydom with no\r\none, and I always keeps my own mind.\r\n\r\n“I dunno how much I earn a-day--p’rhaps I may git a shilling, and\r\np’rhaps sixpence. I didn’t git much yesterday (Sunday)--only sixpence.\r\nI was not out on Saturday; I was ill in bed, and I was at home on\r\nFriday. Indeed, I did not get much on Thursday, only tuppence ha’penny.\r\nThe largest day? I dunno. Why, about a shilling. Well, sure, I might\r\ngit as much as two shillings, if I got a shillin’ from a lady. Some\r\ngintlemen are good--such a gintleman as you, now, might give me a\r\nshilling.\r\n\r\n“Well, as to weather, I likes half dry and half wit; of course I wish\r\nfor the bad wither. Every one must be glad of what brings good to him;\r\nand, there’s one thing, I can’t make the wither--I can’t make a fine\r\nday nor a wit one. I don’t think anybody would interfere with me;\r\ncertainly, if I was a blaggya’rd I should not be left here; no, nor if\r\nI was a thief; but if any other man was to come on to my crossing, I\r\ncan’t say whether the police _would_ interfere to protect me--p’rhaps\r\nthey might.\r\n\r\n“What is it I say to shabby people? Well, by J----, they’re all shabby,\r\nI think. I don’t see any difference; but what can I do? I can’t insult\r\nthim, and I was niver insulted mysilf, since here I’ve been, nor, for\r\nthe matter of that, ever had an angry worrud spoken to me.\r\n\r\n“Well, sure, I dunno who’s the most liberal; if I got a fourpinny bit\r\nfrom a moll I’d take it. Some of the ladies are very liberal; a good\r\nlady will give a sixpence. I never hard of sweepin’ the mud back again;\r\nand as for the boys annoying me, I has no coleaguein’ with boys, and\r\nthey wouldn’t be allowed to interfere with me--the police wouldn’t\r\nallow it.\r\n\r\n“After I came from Wales, where I was on one leg, selling matches,\r\nthen it was I took to sweep the crossin’. A poor divil must put up\r\nwith anything, good or bad. Well, I was a laborin’ man, a bricklayer’s\r\nlabourer, and I’ve been away from Ireland these sixteen year. When I\r\ncame from Ireland I went to Wales. I was there a long time; and the\r\nway I broke my leg was, I fell off a scaffold. I am not married; a\r\nlame man wouldn’t get any woman to have him in London at all, at all.\r\nI don’t know what age I am. I am not fifty, nor forty; I think about\r\nthirty-six. No, by J----, it’s not mysilf that iver knew a well-off\r\ncrossin’-sweeper. I don’t dale in them at all.\r\n\r\n“I got a dale of friends in London assist me (but only now and thin).\r\nIf I depinded on the few ha’pence I get, I wouldn’t live on ’em; what\r\nmoney I get here wouldn’t buy a pound of mate; and I wouldn’t live,\r\nonly for my frinds. You see, sir, I can’t be out always. I am laid\r\nup nows and thins continually. Oh, it’s a poor trade to big on the\r\ncrossin’ from morning till night, and not get sixpence. I couldn’t do\r\nwith it, I know.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, I smoke; it’s a comfort, it is. I like any kind I’d get to\r\nsmoke. I’d like the best if I got it.\r\n\r\n“I am a Roman Catholic, and I go to St. Patrick’s, in St. Giles’s; a\r\nmany people from my neighbourhood go there. I go every Sunday, and to\r\nConfession just once a-year--that saves me.\r\n\r\n“By the Lord’s mercy! I don’t get broken victuals, nor broken mate, not\r\nas much as you might put on the tip of a forruk; they’d chuck it out in\r\nthe dust-bin before they’d give it to me. I suppose they’re all alike.\r\n\r\n“The divil an odd job I iver got, master, nor knives to clane. If I got\r\ntheir knives to clane, p’rhaps I might clane them.\r\n\r\n“My brooms cost threepence ha’penny; they are very good. I wear them\r\ndown to a stump, and they last three weeks, this fine wither. I niver\r\ngot any ould clothes--not but I want a coat very bad, sir.\r\n\r\n“I come from Dublin; my father and mother died there of cholera; and\r\nwhen they died, I come to England, and that was the cause of my coming.\r\n\r\n“By my oath it didn’t stand me in more than eighteenpence that I took\r\nhere last week.\r\n\r\n“I live in ---- lane, St. Giles’s Church, on the second landing, and I\r\npay eightpence a week. I haven’t a room to mysilf, for there’s a family\r\nlives in it wid me.\r\n\r\n“When I goes home I just smokes a pipe, and goes to bid, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--JUVENILE CROSSING-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. The Boy Crossing-Sweepers._\r\n\r\n\r\nBOY CROSSING-SWEEPERS AND TUMBLERS.\r\n\r\nA remarkably intelligent lad, who, on being spoken to, at once\r\nconsented to give all the information in his power, told me the\r\nfollowing story of his life.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this boy’s account, and the one or two following,\r\nthat a kind of partnership exists among some of these young sweepers.\r\nThey have associated themselves together, appropriated several\r\ncrossings to their use, and appointed a captain over them. They have\r\ntheir forms of trial, and “jury-house” for the settlement of disputes;\r\nlaws have been framed, which govern their commercial proceedings, and a\r\nkind of language adopted by the society for its better protection from\r\nits arch-enemy, the policeman.\r\n\r\nI found the lad who first gave me an insight into the proceedings of\r\nthe associated crossing-sweepers crouched on the stone steps of a door\r\nin Adelaide-street, Strand; and when I spoke to him he was preparing to\r\nsettle down in a corner and go to sleep--his legs and body being curled\r\nround almost as closely as those of a cat on a hearth.\r\n\r\nThe moment he heard my voice he was upon his feet, asking me to “give a\r\nhalfpenny to poor little Jack.”\r\n\r\nHe was a good-looking lad, with a pair of large mild eyes, which he\r\ntook good care to turn up with an expression of supplication as he\r\nmoaned for his halfpenny.\r\n\r\nA cap, or more properly a stuff bag, covered a crop of hair which had\r\nmatted itself into the form of so many paint-brushes, while his face,\r\nfrom its roundness of feature and the complexion of dirt, had an almost\r\nIndian look about it; the colour of his hands, too, was such that you\r\ncould imagine he had been shelling walnuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOY CROSSING-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\n[_From a Daguerreotype by_ BEARD.]]\r\n\r\nHe ran before me, treading cautiously with his naked feet, until I\r\nreached a convenient spot to take down his statement, which was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n“I’ve got no mother or father; mother has been dead for two years,\r\nand father’s been gone more than that--more nigh five years--he died\r\nat Ipswich, in Suffolk. He was a perfumer by trade, and used to make\r\nhair-dye, and scent, and pomatum, and all kinds of scents. He didn’t\r\nkeep a shop himself, but he used to serve them as did; he didn’t hawk\r\nhis goods about, neether, but had regular customers, what used to send\r\nhim a letter, and then he’d take them what they wanted. Yes, he used to\r\nserve some good shops: there was H----’s, of London Bridge, what’s a\r\nlarge chemist’s. He used to make a good deal of money, but he lost it\r\nbetting; and so his brother, my uncle, did all his. He used to go\r\nup to High Park, and then go round by the Hospital, and then turn up\r\na yard, where all the men are who play for money [Tattersall’s]; and\r\nthere he’d lose his money, or sometimes win,--but that wasn’t often. I\r\nremember he used to come home tipsy, and say he’d lost on this or that\r\nhorse, naming wot one he’d laid on; and then mother would coax him to\r\nbed, and afterwards sit down and begin to cry.\r\n\r\n“I was not with father when he died (but I was when he was dying),\r\nfor I was sent up along with eldest sister to London with a letter to\r\nuncle, who was head servant at a doctor’s. In this letter, mother asked\r\nuncle to pay back some money wot he owed, and wot father lent him, and\r\nshe asked him if he’d like to come down and see father before he died.\r\nI recollect I went back again to mother by the Orwell steamer. I was\r\nwell dressed then, and had good clothes on, and I was given to the care\r\nof the captain--Mr. King his name was. But when I got back to Ipswich,\r\nfather was dead.\r\n\r\n“Mother took on dreadful; she was ill for three months afterwards,\r\nconfined to her bed. She hardly eat anything: only beaf-tea--I think\r\nthey call it--and eggs. All the while she kept on crying.\r\n\r\n“Mother kept a servant; yes, sir, we always had a servant, as long\r\nas I can recollect; and she and the woman as was there--Anna they\r\ncalled her, an old lady--used to take care of me and sister. Sister\r\nwas fourteen years old (she’s married to a young man now, and they’ve\r\ngone to America; she went from a place in the East India Docks, and I\r\nsaw her off). I used, when I was with mother, to go to school in the\r\nmorning, and go at nine and come home at twelve to dinner, then go\r\nagain at two and leave off at half-past four,--that is, if I behaved\r\nmyself and did all my lessons right; for if I did not I was kept\r\nback till I _did_ them so. Mother used to pay one shilling a-week,\r\nand extra for the copy-books and things. I can read and write--oh,\r\nyes, I mean read and write well--read anything, even old English; and\r\nI write pretty fair,--though I don’t get much reading now, unless\r\nit’s a penny paper--I’ve got one in my pocket now--it’s the _London\r\nJournal_--there’s a tale in it now about two brothers, and one of them\r\nsteals the child away and puts another in his place, and then he gets\r\nfound out, and all that, and he’s just been falling off a bridge now.\r\n\r\n“After mother got better, she sold all the furniture and goods and came\r\nup to London;--poor mother! She let a man of the name of Hayes have the\r\ngreater part, and he left Ipswich soon after, and never gave mother the\r\nmoney. We came up to London, and mother took two rooms in Westminster,\r\nand I and sister lived along with her. She used to make hair-nets, and\r\nsister helped her, and used to take ’em to the hair-dressers to sell.\r\nShe made these nets for two or three years, though she was suffering\r\nwith a bad breast;--she died of that--poor thing!--for she had what\r\ndoctors calls cancer--perhaps you’ve heard of ’em, sir,--and they had\r\nto cut all round here (making motions with his hands from the shoulder\r\nto the bosom). Sister saw it, though I didn’t.\r\n\r\n“Ah! she was a very good, kind mother, and very fond of both of us;\r\nthough father wasn’t, for he’d always have a noise with mother when he\r\ncome home, only he was seldom with us when he was making his goods.\r\n\r\n“After mother died, sister still kept on making nets, and I lived with\r\nher for some time, until she told me she couldn’t afford to keep me\r\nno longer, though she seemed to have a pretty good lot to do; but she\r\nwould never let me go with her to the shops, though I could crochet,\r\nwhich she’d learned me, and used to run and get her all her silks and\r\nthings what she wanted. But she was keeping company with a young man,\r\nand one day they went out, and came back and said they’d been and got\r\nmarried. It was him as got rid of me.\r\n\r\n“He was kind to me for the first two or three months, while he was\r\nkeeping her company; but before he was married he got a little cross,\r\nand after he was married he begun to get more cross, and used to send\r\nme to play in the streets, and tell me not to come home again till\r\nnight. One day he hit me, and I said I wouldn’t be hit about by him,\r\nand then at tea that night sister gave me three shillings, and told me\r\nI must go and get my own living. So I bought a box and brushes (they\r\ncost me just the money) and went cleaning boots, and I done pretty well\r\nwith them, till my box was stole from me by a boy where I was lodging.\r\nHe’s in prison now--got six calendar for picking pockets.\r\n\r\n“Sister kept all my clothes. When I asked her for ’em, she said they\r\nwas disposed of along with all mother’s goods; but she gave me some\r\nshirts and stockings, and such-like, and I had very good clothes, only\r\nthey was all worn out. I saw sister after I left her, many times. I\r\nasked her many times to take me back, but she used to say, ‘It was not\r\nher likes, but her husband’s, or she’d have had me back;’ and I think\r\nit was true, for until he came she was a kind-hearted girl; but he said\r\nhe’d enough to do to look after his own living; he was a fancy-baker by\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n“I was fifteen the 24th of last May, sir, and I’ve been sweeping\r\ncrossings now near upon two years. There’s a party of six of us, and\r\nwe have the crossings from St. Martin’s Church as far as Pall Mall.\r\nI always go along with them as lodges in the same place as I do. In\r\nthe daytime, if it’s dry, we do anythink what we can--open cabs, or\r\nanythink; but if it’s wet, we separate, and I and another gets a\r\ncrossing--those who gets on it first, keeps it,--and we stand on each\r\nside and take our chance.\r\n\r\n“We do it in this way:--if I was to see two gentlemen coming, I should\r\ncry out, ‘Two toffs!’ and then they are mine; and whether they give\r\nme anythink or not they are mine, and my mate is bound not to follow\r\nthem; for if he did he would get a hiding from the whole lot of us. If\r\nwe both cry out together, then we share. If it’s a lady and gentleman,\r\nthen we cries, ‘A toff and a doll!’ Sometimes we are caught out in this\r\nway. Perhaps it is a lady and gentleman and a child; and if I was to\r\nsee them, and only say, ‘A toff and a doll,’ and leave out the child,\r\nthen my mate can add the child; and as he is right and I wrong, then\r\nit’s his party.\r\n\r\n“If there’s a policeman close at hand we mustn’t ask for money; but we\r\nare always on the look-out for the policemen, and if we see one, then\r\nwe calls out ‘Phillup!’ for that’s our signal. One of the policemen at\r\nSt. Martin’s Church--Bandy, we calls him--knows what Phillup means, for\r\nhe’s up to us; so we had to change the word. (At the request of the\r\nyoung crossing-sweeper the present signal is omitted.)\r\n\r\n“Yesterday on the crossing I got threepence halfpenny, but when it’s\r\ndry like to-day I do nothink, for I haven’t got a penny yet. We never\r\ncarries no pockets, for if the policemen find us we generally pass the\r\nmoney to our mates, for if money’s found on us we have fourteen days in\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n“If I was to reckon all the year round, that is, one day with another,\r\nI think we make fourpence every day, and if we were to stick to it we\r\nshould make more, for on a very muddy day we do better. One day, the\r\nbest I ever had, from nine o’clock in the morning till seven o’clock\r\nat night, I made seven shillings and sixpence, and got not one bit of\r\nsilver money among it. Every shilling I got I went and left at a shop\r\nnear where my crossing is, for fear I might get into any harm. The\r\nshop’s kept by a woman we deals with for what we wants--tea and butter,\r\nor sugar, or brooms--anythink we wants. Saturday night week I made\r\ntwo-and-sixpence; that’s what I took altogether up to six o’clock.\r\n\r\n“When we see the rain we say together, ‘Oh! there’s a jolly good rain!\r\nwe’ll have a good day to-morrow.’ If a shower comes on, and we are at\r\nour room, which we general are about three o’clock, to get somethink to\r\neat--besides, we general go there to see how much each other’s taken in\r\nthe day--why, out we run with our brooms.\r\n\r\n“We’re always sure to make money if there’s mud--that’s to say, if we\r\nlook for our money, and ask; of course, if we stand still we don’t.\r\nNow, there’s Lord Fitzhardinge, he’s a good gentleman, what lives\r\nin Spring-gardens, in a large house. He’s got a lot of servants and\r\ncarriages. Every time he crosses the Charing-cross crossing he always\r\ngives the girl half a sovereign.” (This statement was taken in June\r\n1856.) “He doesn’t cross often, because, hang it, he’s got such a lot\r\nof carriages, but when he’s on foot he always does. If they asks him\r\nhe doesn’t give nothink, but if they touches their caps he does. The\r\nhousekeeper at his house is very kind to us. We run errands for her,\r\nand when she wants any of her own letters taken to the post then she\r\ncalls, and if we are on the crossing we takes them for her. She’s a\r\nvery nice lady, and gives us broken victuals. I’ve got a share in that\r\ncrossing,--there are three of us, and when he gives the half sovereign\r\nhe always gives it to the girl, and those that are in it shares it. She\r\nwould do us out of it if she could, but we all takes good care of that,\r\nfor we are all cheats.\r\n\r\n“At night-time we tumbles--that is, if the policemen ain’t nigh. We\r\ngoes general to Waterloo-place when the Opera’s on. We sends on one\r\nof us ahead, as a looker-out, to look for the policeman, and then we\r\nfollows. It’s no good tumbling to gentlemen _going_ to the Opera; it’s\r\nwhen they’re coming back they gives us money. When they’ve got a young\r\nlady on their arm they laugh at us tumbling; some will give us a penny,\r\nothers threepence, sometimes a sixpence or a shilling, and sometimes a\r\nhalfpenny. We either do the cat’un-wheel, or else we keep before the\r\ngentleman and lady, turning head-over-heels, putting our broom on the\r\nground and then turning over it.\r\n\r\n“I work a good deal fetching cabs after the Opera is over; we general\r\nopen the doors of those what draw up at the side of the pavement for\r\npeople to get into as have walked a little down the Haymarket looking\r\nfor a cab. We gets a month in prison if we touch the others by the\r\ncolumns. I once had half a sovereign give me by a gentleman; it was\r\nraining awful, and I run all about for a cab, and at last I got one.\r\nThe gentleman knew it was half a sovereign, because he said--‘Here, my\r\nlittle man, here’s half a sovereign for your trouble.’ He had three\r\nladies with him, beautiful ones, with nothink on their heads, and\r\nonly capes on their bare shoulders; and he had white kids on, and his\r\nregular Opera togs, too. I liked him very much, and as he was going\r\nto give me somethink the ladies says--‘Oh, give him somethink extra!’\r\nIt was pouring with rain, and they couldn’t get a cab; they were all\r\nengaged, but I jumped on the box of one as was driving along the line.\r\nLast Saturday Opera night I made fifteen pence by the gentlemen coming\r\nfrom the Opera.\r\n\r\n“After the Opera we go into the Haymarket, where all the women are who\r\nwalk the streets all night. They don’t give us no money, but they tell\r\nthe gentlemen to. Sometimes, when they are talking to the gentlemen,\r\nthey say, ‘Go away, you young rascal!’ and if they are saucy, then we\r\nsay to them, ‘We’re not talking to you, my doxy, we’re talking to the\r\ngentleman,’--but that’s only if they’re rude, for if they speak civil\r\nwe always goes. They knows what ‘doxy’ means. What is it? Why that\r\nthey are no better than us! If we are on the crossing, and we says to\r\nthem as they go by, ‘Good luck to you!’ they always give us somethink\r\neither that night or the next. There are two with bloomer bonnets, who\r\nalways give us somethink if we says ‘Good luck.’ Sometimes a gentleman\r\nwill tell us to go and get them a young lady, and then we goes, and\r\nthey general gives us sixpence for that. If the gents is dressed finely\r\nwe gets them a handsome girl; if they’re dressed middling, then we gets\r\nthem a middling-dressed one; but we usual prefers giving a turn to\r\ngirls that have been kind to us, and they are sure to give us somethink\r\nthe next night. If we don’t find any girls walking, we knows where to\r\nget them in the houses in the streets round about.\r\n\r\n“We always meet at St. Martin’s steps--the ‘jury house,’ we calls\r\n’em--at three o’clock in the morning, that’s always our hour. We\r\nreckons up what we’ve taken, but we don’t divide. Sometimes, if we owe\r\nanythink where we lodge, the women of the house will be waiting on the\r\nsteps for us: then, if we’ve got it, we pay them; if we haven’t, why it\r\ncan’t be helped, and it goes on. We gets into debt, because sometimes\r\nthe women where we live gets lushy; then we don’t give them anythink,\r\nbecause they’d forget it, so we spends it ourselves. We can’t lodge at\r\nwhat’s called model lodging-houses, as our hours don’t suit them folks.\r\nWe pays threepence a-night for lodging. Food, if we get plenty of\r\nmoney, we buys for ourselves. We buys a pound of bread, that’s twopence\r\nfarthing--best seconds, and a farthing’s worth of dripping--that’s\r\nenough for a pound of bread--and we gets a ha’porth of tea and a\r\nha’porth of sugar; or if we’re hard up, we gets only a penn’orth of\r\nbread. We make our own tea at home; they lends us a kittle, teapot, and\r\ncups and saucers, and all that.\r\n\r\n“Once or twice a-week we gets meat. We all club together, and go into\r\nNewgate Market and gets some pieces cheap, and biles them at home. We\r\ntosses up who shall have the biggest bit, and we divide the broth, a\r\ncupful in each basin, until it’s lasted out. If any of us has been\r\nunlucky we each gives the unlucky one one or two halfpence. Some of us\r\nis obliged at times to sleep out all night; and sometimes, if any of us\r\ngets nothink, then the others gives him a penny or two, and _he_ does\r\nthe same for us when _we_ are out of luck.\r\n\r\n“Besides, there’s our clothes: I’m paying for a pair of boots now. I\r\npaid a shilling off Saturday night.\r\n\r\n“When we gets home at half-past three in the morning, whoever cries\r\nout ‘first wash’ has it. First of all we washes our feet, and we all\r\nuses the same water. Then we washes our faces and hands, and necks, and\r\nwhoever fetches the fresh water up has first wash; and if the second\r\ndon’t like to go and get fresh, why he uses the dirty. Whenever we come\r\nin the landlady makes us wash our feet. Very often the stones cuts our\r\nfeet and makes them bleed; then we bind a bit of rag round them. We\r\nlike to put on boots and shoes in the daytime, but at night-time we\r\ncan’t, because it stops the tumbling.\r\n\r\n“On the Sunday we all have a clean shirt put on before we go out, and\r\nthen we go and tumble after the omnibuses. Sometimes we do very well\r\non a fine Sunday, when there’s plenty of people out on the roofs of\r\nthe busses. We never do anythink on a wet day, but only when it’s\r\nbeen raining and then dried up. I have run after a Cremorne bus, when\r\nthey’ve thrown us money, as far as from Charing-cross right up to\r\nPiccadilly, but if they don’t throw us nothink we don’t run very far.\r\nI should think we gets at that work, taking one Sunday with another,\r\neightpence all the year round.\r\n\r\n“When there’s snow on the ground we puts our money together, and goes\r\nand buys an old shovel, and then, about seven o’clock in the morning,\r\nwe goes to the shops and asks them if we shall scrape the snow away. We\r\ngeneral gets twopence every house, but some gives sixpence, for it’s\r\nvery hard to clean the snow away, particular when it’s been on the\r\nground some time. It’s awful cold, and gives us chilblains on our feet;\r\nbut we don’t mind it when we’re working, for we soon gets hot then.\r\n\r\n“Before winter comes, we general save up our money and buys a pair of\r\nshoes. Sometimes we makes a very big snowball and rolls it up to the\r\nhotels, and then the gentlemen laughs and throws us money; or else we\r\npelt each other with snowballs, and then they scrambles money between\r\nus. We always go to Morley’s Hotel, at Charing-cross. The police in\r\nwinter times is kinder to us than in summer, and they only laughs at\r\nus;--p’rhaps it is because there is not so many of us about then,--only\r\nthem as is obligated to find a living for themselves; for many of the\r\nboys has fathers and mothers as sends them out in summer, but keeps\r\nthem at home in winter when it’s piercing cold.\r\n\r\n“I have been to the station-house, because the police always takes us\r\nup if we are out at night; but we’re only locked up till morning,--that\r\nis, if we behaves ourselves when we’re taken before the gentleman. Mr.\r\nHall, at Bow-street, only says, ‘Poor boy, let him go.’ But it’s only\r\nwhen we’ve done nothink but stop out that he says that. He’s a kind old\r\ngentleman; but mind, it’s only when you have been before him two or\r\nthree times he says so, because if it’s a many times, he’ll send you\r\nfor fourteen days.\r\n\r\n“But we don’t mind the police much at night-time, because we jumps\r\nover the walls round the place at Trafalgar-square, and they don’t\r\nlike to follow us at that game, and only stands looking at you over\r\nthe parrypit. There was one tried to jump the wall, but he split his\r\ntrousers all to bits, and now they’re afraid. That was Old Bandy as\r\nbust his breeches; and we all hate him, as well as another we calls\r\nBlack Diamond, what’s general along with the Red Liners, as we calls\r\nthe Mendicity officers, who goes about in disguise as gentlemen, to\r\ntake up poor boys caught begging.\r\n\r\n“When we are talking together we always talk in a kind of slang. Each\r\npoliceman we gives a regular name--there’s ‘Bull’s Head,’ ‘Bandy\r\nShanks,’ and ‘Old Cherry Legs,’ and ‘Dot-and-carry-one;’ they all knows\r\ntheir names as well as us. We never talks of crossings, but ‘fakes.’ We\r\ndon’t make no slang of our own, but uses the regular one.\r\n\r\n“A broom doesn’t last us more than a week in wet weather, and they\r\ncosts us twopence halfpenny each; but in dry weather they are good for\r\na fortnight.”\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG MIKE’S STATEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe next lad I examined was called Mike. He was a short, stout-set\r\nyouth, with a face like an old man’s, for the features were hard\r\nand defined, and the hollows had got filled up with dirt till his\r\ncountenance was brown as an old wood carving. I have seldom seen so\r\ndirty a face, for the boy had been in a perspiration, and then wiped\r\nhis cheeks with his muddy hands, until they were marbled, like the\r\ncovering to a copy-book.\r\n\r\nThe old lady of the house in which the boy lived seemed to be hurt by\r\nthe unwashed appearance of her lodger. “You ought to be ashamed of\r\nyourself--and that’s God’s truth--not to go and sluice yourself afore\r\nspaking to the jintlemin,” she cried, looking alternately at me and the\r\nlad, as if asking me to witness her indignation.\r\n\r\nMike wore no shoes, but his feet were as black as if cased in gloves\r\nwith short fingers. His coat had been a man’s, and the tails reached to\r\nhis ankles; one of the sleeves was wanting, and a dirty rag had been\r\nwound round the arm in its stead. His hair spread about like a tuft of\r\ngrass where a rabbit has been squatting.\r\n\r\nHe said, “I haven’t got neither no father nor no mother,--never had,\r\nsir; for father’s been dead these two year, and mother getting on\r\nfor eight. They was both Irish people, please sir, and father was a\r\nbricklayer. When father was at work in the country, mother used to get\r\nwork carrying loads at Covent-garden Market. I lived with father till\r\nhe died, and that was from a complaint in his chest. After that I lived\r\nalong with my big brother, what’s ’listed in the Marines now. He used\r\nto sweep a crossing in Camden-town, opposite the Southampting Harms,\r\nnear the toll-gate.\r\n\r\n“He did pretty well up there sometimes, such as on Christmas-day, where\r\nhe has took as much as six shillings sometimes, and never less than one\r\nand sixpence. All the gentlements knowed him thereabouts, and one or\r\ntwo used to give him a shilling a-week regular.\r\n\r\n“It was he as first of all put me up to sweep a crossing, and I used to\r\ntake my stand at St. Martin’s Church.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t see anybody working there, so I planted myself on it. After a\r\ntime some other boys come up. They come up and wanted to turn me off,\r\nand began hitting me with their brooms,--they hit me regular hard with\r\nthe old stumps; there was five or six of them; so I couldn’t defend\r\nmyself, but told the policeman, and he turned them all away except\r\nme, because he saw me on first, sir. Now we are all friends, and work\r\ntogether, and all that we earns ourself we has.\r\n\r\n“On a good day, when it’s poured o’ rain and then leave off sudden, and\r\nmade it nice and muddy, I’ve took as much as ninepence; but it’s too\r\ndry now, and we don’t do more than fourpence.\r\n\r\n“At night, I go along with the others tumbling. I does the cat’en-wheel\r\n[probably a contraction of Catherine-wheel]; I throws myself over\r\nsideways on my hands with my legs in the air. I can’t do it more than\r\nfour times running, because it makes the blood to the head, and then\r\nall the things seems to turn round. Sometimes a chap will give me a\r\nlick with a stick just as I’m going over--sometimes a reg’lar good hard\r\nwhack; but it ain’t often, and we general gets a halfpenny or a penny\r\nby it.\r\n\r\n“The boys as runs after the busses was the first to do these here\r\ncat’en-wheels. I know the boy as was the very first to do it. His name\r\nis Gander, so we calls him the Goose.\r\n\r\n“There’s about nine or ten of us in our gang, and as is reg’lar; we\r\nlodges at different places, and we has our reg’lar hours for meeting,\r\nbut we all comes and goes when we likes, only we keeps together, so as\r\nnot to let any others come on the crossings but ourselves.\r\n\r\n“If another boy tries to come on we cries out, ‘Here’s a Rooshian,’ and\r\nthen if he won’t go away, we all sets on him and gives him a drubbing;\r\nand if he still comes down the next day, we pays him out twice as much,\r\nand harder.\r\n\r\n“There’s never been one down there yet as can lick us all together.\r\n\r\n“If we sees one of our pals being pitched into by other boys, we goes\r\nup and helps him. Gander’s the leader of our gang, ’cause he can tumble\r\nback’ards (no, that ain’t the cat’en-wheel, that’s tumbling); so he\r\ngets more tin give him, and that’s why we makes him cap’an.\r\n\r\n“After twelve at night we goes to the Regent’s Circus, and we tumbles\r\nthere to the gentlemen and ladies. The most I ever got was sixpence at\r\na time. The French ladies never give us nothink, but they all says,\r\n‘Chit, chit, chit,’ like hissing at us, for they can’t understand us,\r\nand we’re as bad off with them.\r\n\r\n“If it’s a wet night we leaves off work about twelve o’clock, and don’t\r\nbother with the Haymarket.\r\n\r\n“The first as gets to the crossing does the sweeping away of the mud.\r\nThen they has in return all the halfpence they can take. When it’s been\r\nwet every day, a broom gets down to stump in about four days. We either\r\nburns the old brooms, or, if we can, we sells ’em for a ha’penny to\r\nsome other boy, if he’s flat enough to buy ’em.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGANDER--THE “CAPTAIN” OF THE BOY CROSSING-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\nGander, the captain of the gang of boy crossing-sweepers, was a big lad\r\nof sixteen, with a face devoid of all expression, until he laughed,\r\nwhen the cheeks, mouth, and forehead instantly became crumpled up with\r\na wonderful quantity of lines and dimples. His hair was cut short, and\r\nstood up in all directions, like the bristles of a hearth-broom, and\r\nwas a light dust tint, matching with the hue of his complexion, which\r\nalso, from an absence of washing, had turned to a decided drab, or what\r\nhouse-painters term a stone-colour.\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a lisp, occasioned by the loss of two of his large front\r\nteeth, which allowed the tongue as he talked to appear through the\r\nopening in a round nob like a raspberry.\r\n\r\nThe boy’s clothing was in a shocking condition. He had no coat, and his\r\nblue-striped shirt was as dirty as a French-polisher’s rags, and so\r\ntattered, that the shoulder was completely bare, while the sleeve hung\r\ndown over the hand like a big bag.\r\n\r\nFrom the fish-scales on the sleeves of his coat, it had evidently once\r\nbelonged to some coster in the herring line. The nap was all worn off,\r\nso that the lines of the web were showing like a coarse carpet; and\r\ninstead of buttons, string had been passed through holes pierced at the\r\nside.\r\n\r\nOf course he had no shoes on, and his black trousers, which, with the\r\ngrease on them, were gradually assuming a tarpaulin look, were fastened\r\nover one shoulder by means of a brace and bits of string.\r\n\r\nDuring his statement, he illustrated his account of the tumbling\r\nbackwards--the “caten-wheeling”--with different specimens of the art,\r\nthrowing himself about on the floor with an ease and almost grace, and\r\ntaking up so small a space of the ground for the performance, that his\r\nlimbs seemed to bend as though his bones were flexible like cane.\r\n\r\n“To tell you the blessed truth, I can’t say the last shilling I\r\nhandled.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you go a-believing on him,” whispered another lad in my ear,\r\nwhilst Gander’s head was turned: “he took thirteenpence last night, he\r\ndid.”\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly impossible to obtain from this lad any account of his\r\naverage earnings. The other boys in the gang told me that he made more\r\nthan any of them. But Gander, who is a thorough street-beggar, and\r\nspeaks with a peculiar whine, and who, directly you look at him, puts\r\non an expression of deep distress, seemed to have made up his mind,\r\nthat if he made himself out to be in great want I should most likely\r\nrelieve him--so he would not budge an inch from his twopence a-day,\r\ndeclaring it to be the maximum of his daily earnings.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” he continued, with a persecuted tone of voice, “if I had only\r\ngot a little money, I’d be a bright youth! The first chance as I get\r\nof earning a few halfpence, I’ll buy myself a coat, and be off to the\r\ncountry, and I’ll lay something I’d soon be a gentleman then, and come\r\nhome with a couple of pounds in my pocket, instead of never having\r\nne’er a farthing, as now.”\r\n\r\nOne of the other lads here exclaimed, “Don’t go on like that there,\r\nGoose; you’re making us out all liars to the gentleman.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman also interfered. She lost all patience with Gander, and\r\nreproached him for making a false return of his income. She tried to\r\nshame him into truthfulness, by saying,--\r\n\r\n“Look at my Johnny--my grandson, sir, he’s not a quarther the\r\nGoose’s size, and yet he’ll bring me home his shilling, or perhaps\r\neighteenpence or two shillings--for shame on you, Gander! Now, did you\r\nmake six shillings last week?--now, speak God’s truth!”\r\n\r\n“What! six shillings?” cried the Goose--“six shillings!” and he began\r\nto look up at the ceiling, and shake his hands. “Why, I never heard of\r\nsich a sum. I did once _see_ a half-crown; but I don’t know as I ever\r\ntouched e’er a one.”\r\n\r\n“Thin,” added the old woman, indignantly, “it’s because you’re idle,\r\nGander, and you don’t study when you’re on the crossing; but lets the\r\ngintlefolk go by without ever a word. That’s what it is, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe Goose seemed to feel the truth of this reproach, for he said with a\r\nsigh, “I knows I am fickle-minded.”\r\n\r\nHe then continued his statement,--\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell how many brooms I use; for as fast as I gets one, it is\r\ntook from me. God help me! They watch me put it away, and then up they\r\ncomes and takes it. What kinds of brooms is the best? Why, as far as I\r\nam concerned, I would sooner have a stump on a dry day--it’s lighter\r\nand handier to carry; but on a wet day, give me a new un.\r\n\r\n“I’m sixteen, your honour, and my name’s George Gandea, and the boys\r\ncalls me ‘the Goose’ in consequence; for it’s a nickname they gives me,\r\nthough my name ain’t spelt with a _har_ at the end, but with a _h’ay_,\r\nso that I ain’t Gand_er_ after all, but Gand_ea_, which is a sell for\r\n’em.\r\n\r\n“God knows what I am--whether I’m h’Irish or h’_I_talian, or what; but\r\nI was christened here in London, and that’s all about it.\r\n\r\n“Father was a bookbinder. I’m sixteen now, and father turned me away\r\nwhen I was nine year old, for mother had been dead before that. I was\r\ntold my right name by my brother-in-law, who had my register. He’s\r\na sweep, sir, by trade, and I wanted to know about my real name when\r\nI was going down to the _Waterloo_--that’s a ship as I wanted to get\r\naboard as a cabin-boy.\r\n\r\n“I remember the fust night I slept out after father got rid of me. I\r\nslept on a gentleman’s door-step, in the winter, on the 15th January.\r\nI packed my shirt and coat, which was a pretty good one, right over\r\nmy ears, and then scruntched myself into a doorway, and the policeman\r\npassed by four or five times without seeing on me.\r\n\r\n“I had a mother-in-law at the time; but father used to drink, or else\r\nI should never have been as I am; and he came home one night, and says\r\nhe, ‘Go out and get me a few ha’pence for breakfast,’ and I said I had\r\nnever been in the streets in my life, and couldn’t; and, says he, ‘Go\r\nout, and never let me see you no more,’ and I took him to his word, and\r\nhave never been near him since.\r\n\r\n“Father lived in Barbican at that time, and after leaving him, I used\r\nto go to the Royal Exchange, and there I met a boy of the name of\r\nMichael, and he first learnt me to beg, and made me run after people,\r\nsaying, ‘Poor boy, sir--please give us a ha’penny to get a mossel of\r\nbread.’ But as fast as I got anythink, he used to take it away, and\r\nknock me about shameful; so I left him, and then I picked up with a\r\nchap as taught me tumbling. I soon larnt how to do it, and then I used\r\nto go tumbling after busses. That was my notion all along, and I hadn’t\r\npicked up the way of doing it half an hour before I was after that game.\r\n\r\n“I took to crossings about eight year ago, and the very fust person\r\nas I asked, I had a fourpenny-piece give to me. I said to him, ‘Poor\r\nlittle Jack, yer honour,’ and, fust of all, says he, ‘I haven’t got no\r\ncoppers,’ and then he turns back and give me a fourpenny-bit. I thought\r\nI was made for life when I got that.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t working in a gang then, but all by myself, and I used to\r\ndo well, making about a shilling or ninepence a-day. I lodged in\r\nChurch-lane at that time.\r\n\r\n“It was at the time of the Shibition year (1851) as these gangs come\r\nup. There was lots of boys that came out sweeping, and that’s how they\r\npicked up the tumbling off me, seeing me do it up in the Park, going\r\nalong to the Shibition.\r\n\r\n“The crossing at St. Martin’s Church was mine fust of all; and when the\r\nother lads come to it I didn’t take no heed of ’em--only for that I’d\r\nhave been a bright boy by now, but they carnied me over like; for when\r\nI tried to turn ’em off they’d say, in a carnying way, ‘Oh, let us stay\r\non,’ so I never took no heed of ’em.\r\n\r\n“There was about thirteen of ’em in my gang at that time.\r\n\r\n“They made me cap’an over the lot--I suppose because they thought I was\r\nthe best tumbler of ’em. They obeyed me a little. If I told ’em not to\r\ngo to any gentleman, they wouldn’t, and leave him to me. There was only\r\none feller as used to give me a share of his money, and that was for\r\nlarning him to tumble--he’d give a penny or twopence, just as he yearnt\r\na little or a lot. I taught ’em all to tumble, and we used to do it\r\nnear the crossing, and at night along the streets.\r\n\r\n“We used to be sometimes together of a day, some a-running after one\r\ngentleman, and some after another; but we seldom kept together more\r\nthan three or four at a time.\r\n\r\n“I was the fust to introduce tumbling backards, and I’m proud of\r\nit--yes, sir, I’m proud of it. There’s another little chap as I’m\r\nlarning to do it; but he ain’t got strength enough in his arms like.\r\n(‘Ah!’ exclaimed a lad in the room, ‘he _is_ a one to tumble, is\r\nJohnny--go along the streets like anythink.’)\r\n\r\n“He is the King of the Tumblers,” continued Gander--“King, and I’m\r\nCap’an.”\r\n\r\nThe old grandmother here joined in. “He was taught by a furreign\r\ngintleman, sir, whose wife rode at a circus. He used to come here twice\r\na-day and give him lessons in this here very room, sir. That’s how he\r\ngot it, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” added another lad, in an admiring tone, “see him and the Goose\r\nhave a race! Away they goes, but Jacky will leave him a mile behind.”\r\n\r\nThe history then continued:--“People liked the tumbling backards and\r\nforards, and it got a good bit of money at fust, but they is getting\r\ntired with it, and I’m growing too hold, I fancy. It hurt me awful at\r\nfust. I tried it fust under a railway arch of the Blackwall Railway;\r\nand when I goes backards, I thought it’d cut my head open. It hurts me\r\nif I’ve got a thin cap on.\r\n\r\n“The man as taught me tumbling has gone on the stage. Fust he went\r\nabout with swords, fencing, in public-houses, and then he got engaged.\r\nMe and him once tumbled all round the circus at the Rotunda one night\r\nwot was a benefit, and got one-and-eightpence a-piece, and all for only\r\nfive hours and a half--from six to half-past eleven, and we acting and\r\ntumbling, and all that. We had plenty of beer, too. We was wery much\r\napplauded when we did it.\r\n\r\n“I was the fust boy as ever did ornamental work in the mud of my\r\ncrossings. I used to be at the crossing at the corner of Regent-suckus;\r\nand that’s the wery place where I fust did it. The wery fust thing\r\nas I did was a hanker (anchor)--a regular one, with turn-up sides\r\nand a rope down the centre, and all. I sweeped it away clean in the\r\nmud in the shape of the drawing I’d seen. It paid well, for I took\r\none-and-ninepence on it. The next thing I tried was writing ‘God save\r\nthe Queen;’ and that, too, paid capital, for I think I got two bob.\r\nAfter that I tried We Har (V. R.) and a star, and that was a sweep too.\r\nI never did no flowers, but I’ve done imitations of laurels, and put\r\nthem all round the crossing, and very pretty it looked, too, at night.\r\nI’d buy a farthing candle and stick it over it, and make it nice and\r\ncomfortable, so that the people could look at it easy. Whenever I see\r\na carriage coming I used to douse the glim and run away with it, but\r\nthe wheels would regularly spile the drawings, and then we’d have all\r\nthe trouble to put it to rights again, and that we used to do with our\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“I fust learnt drawing in the mud from a man in Adelaide-street,\r\nStrand; he kept a crossing, but he only used to draw ’em close to the\r\nkerb-stone. He used to keep some soft mud there, and when a carriage\r\ncome up to the Lowther Arcade, after he’d opened the door and let the\r\nlady out, he would set to work, and by the time she come back he’d have\r\nsome flowers, or a We Har, or whatever he liked, done in the mud, and\r\nunderneath he’d write, ‘Please to remember honnest hindustry.’\r\n\r\n“I used to stand by and see him do it, until I’d learnt, and when I\r\nknowed, I went off and did it at my crossing.\r\n\r\n“I was the fust to light up at night though, and now I wish I’d never\r\ndone it, for it was that which got me turned off my crossing, and\r\na capital one it was. I thought the gentlemen coming from the play\r\nwould like it, for it looked very pretty. The policeman said I was\r\ndestructing (obstructing) the thoroughfare, and making too much row\r\nthere, for the people used to stop in the crossing to look, it were so\r\npretty. He took me in charge three times on one night, cause I wouldn’t\r\ngo away; but he let me go again, till at last I thought he would lock\r\nme up for the night, so I hooked it.\r\n\r\n“It was after this as I went to St. Martin’s Church, and I haven’t\r\ndone half as well there. Last night I took three-ha’pence; but I was\r\nlarking, or I might have had more.”\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the very small expense which is required for the toilette\r\nof a crossing-sweeper, I may mention, that within a few minutes after\r\nMaster Gander had finished his statement, he was in possession of a\r\ncoat, for which he had paid the sum of fivepence.\r\n\r\nWhen he brought it into the room, all the boys and the women crowded\r\nround to see the purchase.\r\n\r\n“It’s a very good un,” said the Goose. “It only wants just taking up\r\nhere and there; and this cuff putting to rights.” And as he spoke he\r\npointed to tears large enough for a head to be thrust through.\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen that coat before, sum’ares,” said one of the women; “where\r\ndid you get it?”\r\n\r\n“At the chandly-shop,” answered the Goose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “KING” OF THE TUMBLING-BOY CROSSING-SWEEPERS.\r\n\r\nThe young sweeper who had been styled by his companions the “King” was\r\na pretty-looking boy, only tall enough to rest his chin comfortably\r\non the mantel-piece as he talked to me, and with a pair of grey eyes\r\nthat were as bright and clear as drops of sea-water. He was clad in a\r\nstyle in no way agreeing with his royal title; for he had on a kind of\r\ndirt-coloured shooting-coat of tweed, which was fraying into a kind of\r\ncobweb at the edges and elbows. His trousers too, were rather faulty,\r\nfor there was a pink-wrinkled dot of flesh at one of the knees; while\r\ntheir length was too great for his majesty’s short legs, so that they\r\nhad to be rolled up at the end like a washerwoman’s sleeves.\r\n\r\nHis royal highness was of a restless disposition, and, whilst\r\ntalking, lifted up, one after another, the different ornaments on the\r\nmantel-piece, frowning and looking at them sideways, as he pondered\r\nover the replies he should make to my questions.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the grandmother’s apartment the “king” was absent,\r\nhis majesty having been sent with a pitcher to fetch some spring-water.\r\n\r\nThe “king” also was kind enough to favour me with samples of his\r\nwondrous tumbling powers. He could bend his little legs round till they\r\ncurved like the long German sausages we see in the ham-and-beef shops;\r\nand when he turned head over heels, he curled up his tiny body as\r\nclosely as a wood-louse, and then rolled along, wabbling like an egg.\r\n\r\n“The boys call me Johnny,” he said; “and I’m getting on for eleven,\r\nand I goes along with the Goose and Harry, a-sweeping at St. Martin’s\r\nChurch, and about there. I used, too, to go to the crossing where the\r\nstatute is, sir, at the bottom of the Haymarket. I went along with\r\nthe others; sometimes there were three or four of us, or sometimes\r\none, sir. I never used to sweep unless it was wet. I don’t go out not\r\nbefore twelve or one in the day; it ain’t no use going before that; and\r\nbeside, I couldn’t get up before that, I’m too sleepy. I don’t stop out\r\nso late as the other boys; they sometimes stop all night, but I don’t\r\nlike that. The Goose was out all night along with Martin; they went all\r\nalong up Piccirilly, and there they climbed over the Park railings and\r\nwent a birding all by themselves, and then they went to sleep for an\r\nhour on the grass--so they says. I likes better to come home to my bed.\r\nIt kills me for the next day when I do stop out all night. The Goose is\r\nalways out all night; he likes it.\r\n\r\n“Neither father nor mother’s alive, sir, but I lives along with\r\ngrandmother and aunt, as owns this room, and I always gives them all I\r\ngets.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I makes a shilling, sometimes sixpence, and sometimes less.\r\nI can never take nothink of a day, only of a night, because I can’t\r\ntumble of a day, and I can of a night.\r\n\r\n“The Gander taught me tumbling, and he was the first as did it along\r\nthe crossings. I can tumble quite as well as the Goose; I can turn a\r\ncaten-wheel, and he can’t, and I can go further on forards than him,\r\nbut I can’t tumble backards as he can. I can’t do a handspring, though.\r\nWhy, a handspring’s pitching yourself forards on both hands, turning\r\nover in front, and lighting on your feet; that’s very difficult, and\r\nvery few can do it. There’s one little chap, but he’s very clever, and\r\ncan tie himself up in a knot a’most. I’m best at caten-wheels; I can\r\ndo ’em twelve or fourteen times running--keep on at it. It just _does_\r\ntire you, that’s all. When I gets up I feels quite giddy. I can tumble\r\nabout forty times over head and heels. I does the most of that, and I\r\nthinks it’s the most difficult, but I can’t say which gentlemen likes\r\nbest. You see they are anigh sick of the head-and-heels tumbling, and\r\nthen werry few of the boys can do caten-wheels on the crossings--only\r\ntwo or three besides me.\r\n\r\n“When I see anybody coming, I says, ‘Please, sir, give me a halfpenny,’\r\nand touches my hair, and then I throws a caten-wheel, and has a look at\r\n’em, and if I sees they are laughing, then I goes on and throws more of\r\n’em. Perhaps one in ten will give a chap something. Some of ’em will\r\ngive you a threepenny-bit or p’rhaps sixpence, and others only give\r\nyou a kick. Well, sir, I should say they likes tumbling over head and\r\nheels; if you can keep it up twenty times then they begins laughing,\r\nbut if you only does it once, some of ’em will say, ‘Oh, I could do\r\nthat myself,’ and then they don’t give nothink.\r\n\r\n“I know they calls me the King of Tumblers, and I think I can tumble\r\nthe best of them; none of them is so good as me, only the Goose at\r\ntumbling backards.\r\n\r\n“We don’t crab one another when we are sweeping; if we was to crab\r\none another, we’d get to fighting and giving slaps of the jaw to one\r\nanother. So when we sees anybody coming, we cries, ‘My gentleman and\r\nlady coming here;’ ‘My lady;’ ‘My two gentlemens;’ and if any other\r\nchap gets the money, then we says, ‘I named them, now I’ll have\r\nhalves.’ And if he won’t give it, then we’ll smug his broom or his cap.\r\nI’m the littlest chap among our lot, but if a fellow like the Goose was\r\nto take my naming then I’d smug somethink. I shouldn’t mind his licking\r\nme, I’d smug his money and get his halfpence or somethink. If a chap as\r\ncan’t tumble sees a sporting gent coming and names him, he says to one\r\nof us tumblers, ‘Now, then, who’ll give us halves?’ and then we goes\r\nand tumbles and shares. The sporting gentlemens likes tumbling; they\r\nkicks up more row laughing than a dozen others.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes at night we goes down to Covent Garden, to where Hevans’s\r\nis, but not till all the plays is over, cause Hevans’s don’t shut afore\r\ntwo or three. When the people comes out we gets tumbling afore them.\r\nSome of the drunken gentlemens is shocking spiteful, and runs after a\r\nchap and gives us a cut with the cane; some of the others will give us\r\nmoney, and some will buy our broom off us for sixpence. Me and Jemmy\r\nsold the two of our brooms for a shilling to two drunken gentlemens,\r\nand they began kicking up a row, and going before other gentlemens and\r\npretending to sweep, and taking off their hats begging, like a mocking\r\nof us. They danced about with the brooms, flourishing ’em in the air,\r\nand knocking off people’s hats; and at last they got into a cab, and\r\nchucked the brooms away. The drunken gentlemens is always either jolly\r\nor spiteful.\r\n\r\n“But I goes only to the Haymarket, and about Pall Mall, now. I used to\r\nbe going up to Hevans’s every night, but I can’t take my money up there\r\nnow. I stands at the top of the Haymarket by Windmill-street, and when\r\nI sees a lady and gentleman coming out of the Argyle, then I begs of\r\nthem as they comes across. I says--‘Can’t you give me a ha’penny, sir,\r\npoor little Jack? I’ll stand on my nose for a penny;’--and then they\r\nlaughs at that.\r\n\r\n“Goose can stand on his nose as well as me; we puts the face flat\r\ndown on the ground, instead of standing on our heads. There’s Duckey\r\nDunnovan, and the Stuttering Baboon, too, and two others as well, as\r\ncan do it; but the Stuttering Baboon’s getting too big and fat to do it\r\nwell; he’s a very awkward tumbler. It don’t hurt, only at larning; cos\r\nyou bears more on your hands than your nose.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes they says--‘Well, let us see you do it,’ and then p’raps\r\nthey’ll search in their pockets, and say--‘O, I haven’t got any\r\ncoppers:’ so then we’ll force ’em, and p’raps they’ll pull out their\r\npurse and gives us a little bit of silver.\r\n\r\n“Ah, we works hard for what we gets, and then there’s the policemen\r\nbirching us. Some of ’em is so spiteful, they takes up their belt what\r\nthey uses round the waist to keep their coat tight, and’ll hit us with\r\nthe buckle; but we generally gives ’em the lucky dodge and gets out of\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\n“One night, two gentlemen, officers they was, was standing in the\r\nHaymarket, and a drunken man passed by. There was snow on the ground,\r\nand we’d been begging of ’em, and says one of them--‘I’ll give you a\r\nshilling if you’ll knock that drunken man over.’ We was three of us; so\r\nwe set on him, and soon had him down. After he got up he went and told\r\nthe policemen, but we all cut round different ways and got off, and\r\nthen met again. We didn’t get the shilling, though, cos a boy crabbed\r\nus. He went up to the gentleman, and says he--‘Give it me, sir, I’m the\r\nboy;’ and then we says--‘No, sir, it’s us.’ So, says the officer--‘I\r\nsharn’t give it to none of you,’ and puts it back again in his pockets.\r\nWe broke a broom over the boy as crabbed us, and then we cut down\r\nWaterloo-place, and afterwards we come up to the Haymarket again, and\r\nthere we met the officers again. I did a caten-wheel, and then says\r\nI--‘Then won’t you give me un now?’ and they says--‘Go and sweep some\r\nmud on that woman.’ So I went and did it, and then they takes me in a\r\npastry-shop at the corner, and they tells me to tumble on the tables in\r\nthe shop. I nearly broke one of ’em, they were so delicate. They gived\r\nme a fourpenny meat-pie and two penny sponge-cakes, which I puts in my\r\npocket, cos there was another sharing with me. The lady of the shop\r\nkept on screaming--‘Go and fetch me a police--take the dirty boy out,’\r\ncos I was standing on the tables in my muddy feet, and the officers was\r\na bursting their sides with laughing; and says they, ‘No, he sharn’t\r\nstir.’\r\n\r\n“I was frightened, cos if the police had come they’d been safe and sure\r\nto have took me. They made me tumble from the door to the end of the\r\nshop, and back again, and then I turned ’em a caten-wheel, and was near\r\nknocking down all the things as was on the counter.\r\n\r\n“They didn’t give me no money, only pies; but I got a shilling\r\nanother time for tumbling to some French ladies and gentlemen in a\r\npastry-cook’s shop under the Colonnade. I often goes into a shop like\r\nthat; I’ve done it a good many times.\r\n\r\n“There was a gentleman once as belonged to a ‘suckus,’ (circus) as\r\nwanted to take me with him abroad, and teach me tumbling. He had a\r\nlittle mustache, and used to belong to Drury-lane play-house, riding\r\non horses. I went to his place, and stopped there some time. He taught\r\nme to put my leg round my neck, and I was just getting along nicely\r\nwith the splits (going down on the ground with both legs extended),\r\nwhen I left him. They (the splits) used to hurt worst of all; very bad\r\nfor the thighs. I used, too, to hang with my leg round his neck. When\r\nI did anythink he liked, he used to be clapping me on the back. He\r\nwasn’t so very stunning well off, for he never had what I calls a good\r\ndinner--grandmother used to have a better dinner than he,--perhaps only\r\na bit of scrag of mutton between three of us. I don’t like meat nor\r\nbutter, but I likes dripping, and they never had none there. The wife\r\nused to drink--ay, very much, on the sly. She used when he was out to\r\nsend me round with a bottle and sixpence to get a quartern of gin for\r\nher, and she’d take it with three or four oysters. Grandmother didn’t\r\nlike the notion of my going away, so she went down one day, and says\r\nshe--‘I wants my child;’ and the wife says--‘That’s according to the\r\nmaster’s likings;’ and then grandmother says--‘What, not my own child?’\r\nAnd then grandmother began talking, and at last, when the master come\r\nhome, he says to me--‘Which will you do, stop here, or go home with\r\nyour grandmother?’ So I come along with her.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been sweeping the crossings getting on for two years. Before\r\nthat I used to go caten-wheeling after the busses. I don’t like the\r\nsweeping, and I don’t think there’s e’er a one of us wot likes it. In\r\nthe winter we has to be out in the cold, and then in summer we have to\r\nsleep out all night, or go asleep on the church-steps, reg’lar tired\r\nout.\r\n\r\n“One of us’ll say at night--‘Oh, I’m sleepy now, who’s game for a doss?\r\nI’m for a doss;’--and then we go eight or ten of us into a doorway of\r\nthe church, where they keep the dead in a kind of airy-like underneath,\r\nand there we go to sleep. The most of the boys has got no homes.\r\nPerhaps they’ve got the price of a lodging, but they’re hungry, and\r\nthey eats the money, and then they must lay out. There’s some of ’em\r\nwill stop out in the wet for perhaps the sake of a halfpenny, and get\r\nthemselves sopping wet. I think all our chaps would like to get out of\r\nthe work if they could; I’m sure Goose would, and so would I.\r\n\r\n“All the boys call me the King, because I tumbles so well, and some\r\ncalls me ‘Pluck,’ and some ‘Judy.’ I’m called ‘Pluck,’ cause I’m so\r\nplucked a going at the gentlemen! Tommy Dunnovan--‘Tipperty Tight’--we\r\ncalls him, cos his trousers is so tight he can hardly move in them\r\nsometimes,--he was the first as called me ‘Judy.’ Dunnovan once\r\nswallowed a pill for a shilling. A gentleman in the Haymarket says--‘If\r\nyou’ll swallow this here pill I’ll give you a shilling;’ and Jimmy\r\nsays, ‘All right, sir;’ and he puts it in his mouth, and went to the\r\nwater-pails near the cab-stand and swallowed it.\r\n\r\n“All the chaps in our gang likes me, and we all likes one another. We\r\nalways shows what we gets given to us to eat.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes we gets one another up wild, and then that fetches up a\r\nfight, but that isn’t often. When two of us fights, the others stands\r\nround and sees fair play. There was a fight last night between ‘Broke\r\nhis Bones’--as we calls Antony Hones--and Neddy Hall--the ‘Sparrow,’\r\nor ‘Spider,’ we calls him,--something about the root of a pineapple,\r\nas we was aiming with at one another, and that called up a fight. We\r\nall stood round and saw them at it, but neither of ’em licked, for\r\nthey gived in for to-day, and they’re to finish it to-night. We makes\r\n’em fight fair. We all of us likes to see a fight, but not to fight\r\nourselves. Hones is sure to beat, as Spider is as thin as a wafer, and\r\nall bones. I can lick the Spider, though he’s twice my size.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STREET WHERE THE BOY-SWEEPERS LODGED.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to see the room in which the gang of boy\r\ncrossing-sweepers lived, so that I might judge of their peculiar style\r\nof house-keeping, and form some notion of their principles of domestic\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nI asked young Harry and “the Goose” to conduct me to their lodgings,\r\nand they at once consented, “the Goose” prefacing his compliance with\r\nthe remark, that “it wern’t such as genilmen had been accustomed to,\r\nbut then I must take ’em as they was.”\r\n\r\nThe boys led me in the direction of Drury-lane; and before entering one\r\nof the narrow streets which branch off like the side-bones of a fish’s\r\nspine from that long thoroughfare, they thought fit to caution me that\r\nI was not to be frightened, as nobody would touch me, for all was very\r\ncivil.\r\n\r\nThe locality consisted of one of those narrow streets which, were it\r\nnot for the paved cartway in the centre would be called a court. Seated\r\non the pavement at each side of the entrance was a costerwoman with her\r\nbasket before her, and her legs tucked up mysteriously under her gown\r\ninto a round ball, so that her figure resembled in shape the plaster\r\ntumblers sold by the Italians. These women remained as inanimate as\r\nif they had been carved images, and it was only when a passenger went\r\nby that they gave signs of life, by calling out in a low voice, like\r\ntalking to themselves, “Two for three haarpence--herrens,”--“Fine\r\nhinguns.”\r\n\r\nThe street itself is like the description given of thoroughfares in the\r\nEast. Opposite neighbours could not exactly shake hands out of window,\r\nbut they could talk together very comfortably; and, indeed, as I passed\r\nalong, I observed several women with their arms folded up like a cat’s\r\npaws on the sill, and chatting with their friends over the way.\r\n\r\nNearly all the inhabitants were costermongers, and, indeed, the narrow\r\ncartway seemed to have been made just wide enough for a truck to\r\nwheel down it. A beershop and a general store, together with a couple\r\nof sweeps,--whose residences were distinguished by a broom over the\r\ndoor,--formed the only exceptions to the street-selling class of\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the place, it gave me the notion that it belonged to\r\na distinct coster colony, and formed one large hawkers’ home; for\r\neverybody seemed to be doing just as he liked, and I was stared at as\r\nif considered an intruder. Women were seated on the pavement, knitting,\r\nand repairing their linen; the doorways were filled up with bonnetless\r\ngirls, who wore their shawls over their head, as the Spanish women do\r\ntheir mantillas; and the youths in corduroy and brass buttons, who were\r\nchatting with them, leant against the walls as they smoked their pipes,\r\nand blocked up the pavement, as if they were the proprietors of the\r\nplace. Little children formed a convenient bench out of the kerb-stone;\r\nand a party of four men were seated on the footway, playing with cards\r\nwhich had turned to the colour of brown paper from long usage, and\r\nmarking the points with chalk upon the flags.\r\n\r\nThe parlour-windows of the houses had all of them wooden shutters, as\r\nthick and clumsy-looking as a kitchen flap-table, the paint of which\r\nhad turned to the dull dirt-colour of an old slate. Some of these\r\nshutters were evidently never used as a security for the dwelling, but\r\nserved only as tables on which to chalk the accounts of the day’s sales.\r\n\r\nBefore most of the doors were costermongers’ trucks--some standing\r\nready to be wheeled off, and others stained and muddy with the day’s\r\nwork. A few of the costers were dressing up their barrows, arranging\r\nthe sieves of waxy-looking potatoes--and others taking the stiff\r\nherrings, browned like a meerschaum with the smoke they had been dried\r\nin, from the barrels beside them, and spacing them out in pennyworths\r\non their trays.\r\n\r\nYou might guess what each costermonger had taken out that day by the\r\nheap of refuse swept into the street before the doors. One house had\r\na blue mound of mussel-shells in front of it--another, a pile of the\r\noutside leaves of broccoli and cabbages, turning yellow and slimy with\r\nbruises and moisture.\r\n\r\nHanging up beside some of the doors were bundles of old strawberry\r\npottles, stained red with the fruit. Over the trap-doors to the cellars\r\nwere piles of market-gardeners’ sieves, ruddled like a sheep’s back\r\nwith big red letters. In fact, everything that met the eye seemed to be\r\nin some way connected with the coster’s trade.\r\n\r\nFrom the windows poles stretched out, on which blankets, petticoats,\r\nand linen were drying; and so numerous were they, that they reminded\r\nme of the flags hung out at a Paris fête. Some of the sheets had\r\npatches as big as trap-doors let into their centres; and the blankets\r\nwere--many of them--as full of holes as a pigeon-house.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the court, a “row” was going on; and from a first-floor\r\nwindow a lady, whose hair sadly wanted brushing, was haranguing a\r\ncrowd beneath, throwing her arms about like a drowning man, and in her\r\nexcitement thrusting her body half out of her temporary rostrum as\r\nenergetically as I have seen Punch lean over his theatre.\r\n\r\n“The willin dragged her,” she shouted, “by the hair of her head, at\r\nleast three yards into the court--the willin! and then he kicked her,\r\nand the blood was on his boot.”\r\n\r\nIt was a sweep who had been behaving in this cowardly manner; but still\r\nhe had his defenders in the women around him. One with very shiny hair,\r\nand an Indian kerchief round her neck, answered the lady in the window,\r\nby calling her a “d----d old cat;” whilst the sweep’s wife rushed\r\nabout, clapping her hands together as quickly as if she was applauding\r\nat a theatre, and styled somebody or other “an old wagabones as she\r\nwouldn’t dirty her hands to fight with.”\r\n\r\nThis “row” had the effect of drawing all the lodgers to the\r\nwindows--their heads popping out as suddenly as dogs from their kennels\r\nin a fancier’s yard.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOY-SWEEPERS’ ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe room where the boys lodged was scarcely bigger than a coach-house;\r\nand so low was the ceiling, that a fly-paper suspended from a\r\nclothes-line was on a level with my head, and had to be carefully\r\navoided when I moved about.\r\n\r\nOne corner of the apartment was completely filled up by a big four-post\r\nbedstead, which fitted into a kind of recess as perfectly as if it had\r\nbeen built to order.\r\n\r\nThe old woman who kept this lodging had endeavoured to give it a homely\r\nlook of comfort, by hanging little black-framed pictures, scarcely\r\nbigger than pocket-books, on the walls. Most of these were sacred\r\nsubjects, with large yellow glories round the heads; though between\r\nthe drawing representing the bleeding heart of Christ, and the Saviour\r\nbearing the Cross, was an illustration of a red-waistcoated sailor\r\nsmoking his pipe. The Adoration of the Shepherds, again, was matched on\r\nthe other side of the fireplace by a portrait of Daniel O’Connell.\r\n\r\nA chest of drawers was covered over with a green baize cloth, on which\r\nbooks, shelves, and clean glasses were tidily set out.\r\n\r\nWhere so many persons (for there were about eight of them, including\r\nthe landlady, her daughter, and grandson) could all sleep, puzzled me\r\nextremely.\r\n\r\nThe landlady wore a frilled nightcap, which fitted so closely to the\r\nskull, that it was evident she had lost her hair. One of her eyes\r\nwas slowly recovering from a blow, which, to use her own words, “a\r\nblackgeyard gave her.” Her lip, too, had suffered in the encounter, for\r\nit was swollen and cut.\r\n\r\n“I’ve a nice flock-bid for the boys,” she said, when I inquired into\r\nthe accommodation of her lodging-house, “where three of them can slape\r\naisy and comfortable.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a large bed, sir,” said one of the boys, “and a warm covering\r\nover us; and you see it’s better than a regular lodging-house; for, if\r\nyou want a knife or a cup, you don’t have to leave something on it till\r\nit’s returned.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman spoke up for her lodgers, telling me that they were good\r\nboys, and very honest; “for,” she added, “they pays me rig’lar ivery\r\nnight, which is threepence.”\r\n\r\nThe only youth as to whose morals she seemed to be at all doubtful was\r\n“the Goose,” “for he kept late hours, and sometimes came home without a\r\npenny in his pocket.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_B. The Girl Crossing-Sweepers._\r\n\r\nTHE GIRL CROSSING-SWEEPER SENT OUT BY HER FATHER.\r\n\r\nA little girl, who worked by herself at her own crossing, gave me some\r\ncurious information on the subject.\r\n\r\nThis child had a peculiarly flat face, with a button of a nose, while\r\nher mouth was scarcely larger than a button-hole. When she spoke, there\r\nwas not the slightest expression visible in her features; indeed, one\r\nmight have fancied she wore a mask and was talking behind it; but\r\nher eyes were shining the while as brightly as those of a person in a\r\nfever, and kept moving about, restless with her timidity. The green\r\nfrock she wore was fastened close to the neck, and was turning into a\r\nkind of mouldy tint; she also wore a black stuff apron, stained with\r\nbig patches of gruel, “from feeding baby at home,” as she said. Her\r\nhair was tidily dressed, being drawn tightly back from the forehead,\r\nlike the buy-a-broom girls; and as she stood with her hands thrust up\r\nher sleeves, she curtseyed each time before answering, bobbing down\r\nlike a float, as though the floor under her had suddenly given way.\r\n\r\n“I’m twelve years old, please sir, and my name is Margaret R----, and I\r\nsweep a crossing in New Oxford-street, by Dunn’s-passage, just facing\r\nMoses and Sons’, sir; by the Catholic school, sir. Mother’s been dead\r\nthese two year, sir, and father’s a working cutler, sir; and I lives\r\nwith him, but he don’t get much to do, and so I’m obligated to help\r\nhim, doing what I can, sir. Since mother’s been dead, I’ve had to mind\r\nmy little brother and sister, so that I haven’t been to school; but\r\nwhen I goes a crossing-sweeping I takes them along with me, and they\r\nsits on the steps close by, sir. If it’s wet I has to stop at home and\r\ntake care of them, for father depends upon me for looking after them.\r\nSister’s three and a-half year old, and brother’s five year, so he’s\r\njust beginning to help me, sir. I hope he’ll get something better than\r\na crossing when he grows up.\r\n\r\n“First of all I used to go singing songs in the streets, sir. It was\r\nwhen father had no work, so he stopped at home and looked after the\r\nchildren. I used to sing the ‘Red, White, and Blue,’ and ‘Mother, is\r\nthe Battle over?’ and ‘The Gipsy Girl,’ and sometimes I’d get fourpence\r\nor fivepence, and sometimes I’d have a chance of making ninepence,\r\nsir. Sometimes, though, I’d take a shilling of a Saturday night in the\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n“At last the songs grew so stale people wouldn’t listen to them, and,\r\nas I carn’t read, I couldn’t learn any more, sir. My big brother and\r\nfather used to learn me some, but I never could get enough out of them\r\nfor the streets; besides, father was out of work still, and we couldn’t\r\nget money enough to buy ballads with, and it’s no good singing without\r\nhaving them to sell. We live over there, sir, (pointing to a window on\r\nthe other side of the narrow street).\r\n\r\n“The notion come into my head all of itself to sweep crossings, sir. As\r\nI used to go up Regent-street I used to see men and women, and girls\r\nand boys, sweeping, and the people giving them money, so I thought I’d\r\ndo the same thing. That’s how it come about. Just now the weather is so\r\ndry, I don’t go to my crossing, but goes out singing. I’ve learnt some\r\nnew songs, such as ‘The Queen of the Navy for ever,’ and ‘The Widow’s\r\nLast Prayer,’ which is about the wars. I only go sweeping in wet\r\nweather, because then’s the best time. When I am there, there’s some\r\nladies and gentlemen as gives to me regular. I knows them by sight; and\r\nthere’s a beer-shop where they give me some bread and cheese whenever I\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n“I generally takes about sixpence, or sevenpence, or eightpence on\r\nthe crossing, from about nine o’clock in the morning till four in the\r\nevening, when I come home. I don’t stop out at nights because father\r\nwon’t let me, and I’m got to be home to see to baby.\r\n\r\n“My broom costs me twopence ha’penny, and in wet weather it lasts a\r\nweek, but in dry weather we seldom uses it.\r\n\r\n“When I sees the busses and carriages coming I stands on the side,\r\nfor I’m afeard of being runned over. In winter I goes out and cleans\r\nladies’ doors, general about Lincoln’s-inn, for the housekeepers.\r\nI gets twopence a door, but it takes a long time when the ice is\r\nhardened, so that I carn’t do only about two or three.\r\n\r\n“I carn’t tell whether I shall always stop at sweeping, but I’ve no\r\nclothes, and so I carn’t get a situation; for, though I’m small and\r\nyoung, yet I could do housework, such as cleaning.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, there’s no gang on my crossing--I’m all alone. If another\r\ngirl or a boy was to come and take it when I’m not there, I should stop\r\non it as well as him or her, and go shares with ’em.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGIRL CROSSING-SWEEPER.\r\n\r\nI was told that a little girl formed one of the association of young\r\nsweepers, and at my request one of the boys went to fetch her.\r\n\r\nShe was a clean-washed little thing, with a pretty, expressive\r\ncountenance, and each time she was asked a question she frowned, like\r\na baby in its sleep, while thinking of the answer. In her ears she\r\nwore instead of rings loops of string, “which the doctor had put there\r\nbecause her sight was wrong.” A cotton velvet bonnet, scarcely larger\r\nthan the sun-shades worn at the sea-side, hung on her shoulders,\r\nleaving exposed her head, with the hair as rough as tow. Her green\r\nstuff gown was hanging in tatters, with long three-cornered rents\r\nas large as penny kites, showing the grey lining underneath; and\r\nher mantle was separated into so many pieces, that it was only held\r\ntogether by the braiding at the edge.\r\n\r\nAs she conversed with me, she played with the strings of her bonnet,\r\nrolling them up as if curling them, on her singularly small and also\r\nsingularly dirty fingers.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be fourteen, sir, a fortnight before next Christmas. I was born\r\nin Liquorpond-street, Gray’s Inn-lane. Father come over from Ireland,\r\nand was a bricklayer. He had pains in his limbs and wasn’t strong\r\nenough, so he give it over. He’s dead now--been dead a long time, sir.\r\nI was a littler girl then than I am now, for I wasn’t above eleven at\r\nthat time. I lived with mother after father died. She used to sell\r\nthings in the streets--yes, sir, she was a coster. About a twelvemonth\r\nafter father’s death, mother was taken bad with the cholera, and\r\ndied. I then went along with both grandmother and grandfather, who\r\nwas a porter in Newgate Market; I stopped there until I got a place\r\nas servant of all-work. I was only turned, just turned, eleven then.\r\nI worked along with a French lady and gentleman in Hatton Garden, who\r\nused to give me a shilling a-week and my tea. I used to go home to\r\ngrandmother’s to dinner every day. I hadn’t to do any work, only just\r\nto clean the room and nuss the child. It was a nice little thing. I\r\ncouldn’t understand what the French people used to say, but there was a\r\nboy working there, and he used to explain to me what they meant.\r\n\r\n“I left them because they was going to a place called Italy--perhaps\r\nyou may have heerd tell of it, sir. Well, I suppose they must have\r\nbeen Italians, but we calls everybody, whose talk we don’t understand,\r\nFrench. I went back to grandmother’s, but, after grandfather died, she\r\ncouldn’t keep me, and so I went out begging--she sent me. I carried\r\nlucifer-matches and stay-laces fust. I used to carry about a dozen\r\nlaces, and perhaps I’d sell six out of them. I suppose I used to make\r\nabout sixpence a-day, and I used to take it home to grandmother, who\r\nkept and fed me.\r\n\r\n“At last, finding I didn’t get much at begging, I thought I’d go\r\ncrossing-sweeping. I saw other children doing it. I says to myself,\r\n‘I’ll go and buy a broom,’ and I spoke to another little girl, who was\r\nsweeping up Holborn, who told me what I was to do. ‘But,’ says she,\r\n‘don’t come and cut up me.’\r\n\r\n“I went fust to Holborn, near to home, at the end of Red Lion-street.\r\nThen I was frightened of the cabs and carriages, but I’d get there\r\nearly, about eight o’clock, and sweep the crossing clean, and I’d stand\r\nat the side on the pavement, and speak to the gentlemen and ladies\r\nbefore they crossed.\r\n\r\n“There was a couple of boys, sweepers at the same crossing before I\r\nwent there. I went to them and asked if I might come and sweep there\r\ntoo, and they said Yes, if I would give them some of the halfpence I\r\ngot. These was boys about as old as I was, and they said, if I earned\r\nsixpence, I was to give them twopence a-piece; but they never give me\r\nnothink of theirs. I never took more than sixpence, and out of that I\r\nhad to give fourpence, so that I did not do so well as with the laces.\r\n\r\n“The crossings made my hands sore with the sweeping, and, as I got so\r\nlittle, I thought I’d try somewhere else. Then I got right down to\r\nthe Fountings in Trafalgar-square, by the crossing at the statey on\r\n’orseback. There were a good many boys and girls on that crossing at\r\nthe time--five of them; so I went along with them. When I fust went\r\nthey said, ‘Here’s another fresh ’un.’ They come up to me and says,\r\n‘Are you going to sweep here?’ and I says, ‘Yes;’ and they says, ‘You\r\nmustn’t come here, there’s too many;’ and I says, ‘They’re different\r\nones every day,’--for they’re not regular there, but shift about,\r\nsometimes one lot of boys and girls, and the next day another. They\r\ndidn’t say another word to me, and so I stopped.\r\n\r\n“It’s a capital crossing, but there’s so many of us, it spiles it. I\r\nseldom gets more than sevenpence a-day, which I always takes home to\r\ngrandmother.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been on that crossing about three months. They always calls me\r\nEllen, my regular name, and behaves very well to me. If I see anybody\r\ncoming, I call them out as the boys does, and then they are mine.\r\n\r\n“There’s a boy and myself, and another strange girl, works on our side\r\nof the statey, and another lot of boys and girls on the other.\r\n\r\n“I like Saturdays the best day of the week, because that’s the time\r\nas gentlemen as has been at work has their money, and then they are\r\nmore generous. I gets more then, perhaps ninepence, but not quite a\r\nshilling, on the Saturday.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had a threepenny-bit give to me, but never sixpence. It was a\r\ngentleman, and I should know him again. Ladies gives me less than\r\ngentlemen. I foller ’em, saying, ‘If you please, sir, give a poor girl\r\na halfpenny;’ but if the police are looking, I stop still.\r\n\r\n“I never goes out on Sunday, but stops at home with grandmother. I\r\ndon’t stop out at nights like the boys, but I gets home by ten at\r\nlatest.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Articles for amusement, second-hand sellers of, 16\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bear-baiting,

strictly includes only such\r\nindividuals as confine themselves to the sale of the produce of\r\nthe Green and Fruit Markets: the term is here restricted to that\r\nsignification.\r\n\r\n[2] This number includes Men, Women, and Children.\r\n\r\n[3] The Watercress trade is carried on in the streets, principally by\r\nold people and children. The chief mart to which the street-sellers of\r\ncresses resort is Farringdon-market, a place which but few or none of\r\nthe regular Costermongers attend.\r\n\r\n[4] The Chickweed and Groundsell Sellers and the Turf-Cutters’ traffic\r\nhas but little expense connected with it, and their trade is therefore\r\nnearly all profit.\r\n\r\n[5] “v. t.” signifies “various times,” of theft and of “restoration.”\r\n\r\n[6] The Metropolitan Police District comprises a circle, the radius of\r\nwhich is 15 miles from Charing Cross; the extreme boundary on the N.\r\nincludes the parish of Cheshunt and South Mimms; on the S., Epsom; on\r\nthe E., Dagenham and Crayford; and on the W., Uxbridge and Staines.\r\n\r\n[7] The inner district includes the parish of St. John, Hampstead, on\r\nthe N.; Tooting and Streatham on the S.; Ealing and Brentford on the\r\nW.; and Greenwich on the E.\r\n\r\nThe Registrar General’s District is equal, or nearly so, to the inner\r\nMetropolitan Police District.\r\n\r\n[8] The City of London is bounded on the S. by the River, on the E. by\r\nWhitechapel, on the W. by Chancery Lane, and N. by Finsbury.\r\n\r\n[9] The area here stated is that of the city without the walls,\r\nand includes White Friars precinct and Holy Trinity, Minories, both\r\nbelonging to other districts.\r\n\r\n[10] This area is that of the city within the walls, and does not\r\ninclude White Friars, which belongs to the district.\r\n\r\n[11] The area of the districts of St. Saviour and St. Olave is included\r\nin that returned for St. George, Southwark.\r\n\r\n[12] The population and number of inhabited houses in these districts\r\nhas decreased annually to this extent since 1841.\r\n\r\n[13] This relates merely to the repairs to the wooden pavement, but if\r\na renewal of the blocks be necessary, then the cost approaches that of\r\na new road; and a renewal is considered necessary about once in three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[14] “Haunsed” is explained by Strype to signify “made too high,” and\r\nthe “Redosses” to be “Reredoughs.” A mason informed me that he believed\r\nthese Redosses were what were known in some old country-houses as\r\n“Back-Flues,” or flues connecting any fire-grate in the out-offices\r\nwith the main chimney. The term “lene” is the Teutonic _Lehn_, and\r\nsignifies “let, lease,” or literally _loan_.\r\n\r\n[15] The reader will remember that in the historical sketch given\r\nof the progress of public scavengery, the word “Rakers” occurred in\r\nconnection with the sworn master scavengers, &c., &c.; the word is now\r\nunknown to the trade, except that it appears on city documents.\r\n\r\n[16] The parishes marked thus [16] have their dustmen and dust-carts,\r\nas well as the rubbish carting and the individuals in the dust-yard,\r\nreckoned in the numbers employed by the contractors.\r\n\r\n[17] I have computed all the weekly wages at 16_s._, though some of the\r\nmen are paid only 14_s._ My object in this is to give the contractors\r\nthe benefit of the difference.\r\n\r\n[18] The Saxon _Sceorfa_, which is the original of the English Scurf,\r\nmeans a scab, and scab is the term given to the “cheap men” in the\r\nshoemaking trade. Scab is the root of our word _Shabby_; hence Scurf\r\nand Scab, deprived of their offensive associations, both mean shabby\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\n[19] These items wages _must_ include to prevent pauperism, _even with\r\nprovidence_. But this is only on the supposition that the labourer is\r\nunmarried; if married, however, and having a family, then his wages\r\nshould include, moreover, the keep of at least three extra persons,\r\nas well as the education of the children. If not, one of two results\r\nis self-evident--either the wife must toil, to the neglect of her\r\nyoung ones, and they be allowed to run about and pick their morals and\r\neducation, as I have before said, out of the gutter, or else the whole\r\nfamily must be transferred to the care of the parish.\r\n\r\n[20] I have estimated the whole at 15_s._ a week the year through,\r\ngangers, “honourable men,” regular hands and all, so as to allow for\r\nthe diminished receipts of the casual hands.\r\n\r\n[21] The usual argument in favour of machinery, viz., that “by reducing\r\nprices it extends the market, and so, causing a greater demand for\r\nthe commodities, induces a greater quantity of employment,” would\r\nalso be an argument in favour of over population, since this, by\r\ncheapening labour, must have the same effect as machinery on prices,\r\nand, consequently (according to the above logic), induce a greater\r\nquantity of employment! But granting that machinery really does benefit\r\nthe labourer in cases _where the market, and therefore the quantity\r\nof work, is largely extensible_, surely it cannot but be an injury in\r\nthose callings where _the quantity of work is fixed_. Such is the fact\r\nwith the sawing of wood, the reaping of corn, the threshing of corn,\r\nthe sweeping of the streets, &c., and hence the evil of mechanical\r\nlabour applied to such trades.\r\n\r\n[22] Mr. Sidney Herbert informed me, that when he was connected with\r\nthe Ordnance Department the severest punishment they could discover for\r\nidleness was the piling and unpiling of cannon shot; but surely this\r\nwas the consummation of official folly! for idleness being simply an\r\naversion to work, it is almost self-evident that it is _impossible_\r\nto remove this aversion by making labour inordinately irksome and\r\nrepulsive. Until we understand the means by which work is made\r\npleasant, and can discover other modes of employing our paupers and\r\ncriminals, all our workhouse and prison discipline is idle tyranny.\r\n\r\n[23] This is done at the Model Prison, Pentonville.\r\n\r\n[24] The number of men here given as employed by the parishes in the\r\nscavaging of the streets will be found to differ from that of the table\r\nat page 213; but the present table includes all the parish-men employed\r\nthroughout London, whereas the other referred to only a portion of the\r\nlocalities there mentioned.\r\n\r\n[25] To the honourable conduct of the above-named contractors to their\r\nmen, I am glad to be able to bear witness. All the men speak in the\r\nhighest terms of them.\r\n\r\n[26] This is Mr. Mills’s second _fundamental_ proposition respecting\r\ncapital (see “Principles of Pol. Econ.” p. 82, vol. i.). “What I intend\r\nto assert is,” says that gentleman, “that the portion (of capital)\r\nwhich is destined to the maintenance of the labourers may--supposing no\r\nincrease in anything else--be indefinitely increased, without creating\r\nan impossibility of finding them employment--in other words, if there\r\nare human beings capable of work, and food to feed them, they may\r\nalways be employed in producing something.”\r\n\r\n[27] Mr. Cochrane is said, in the Reports of the National Philanthropic\r\nAssociation, to have expended no less than 6000_l._ of his fortune in\r\nthe institution of the Street-Orderly system of scavaging.\r\n\r\n[28] A street-orderly in St. Martin’s-lane recovered a piece of\r\nbroad-cloth from a man who had just stolen it from a warehouse;\r\nothers in Drury-lane detected several thefts from provision-shops.\r\nTwo orderlies in Holborn saved the lives of the guard and driver of\r\none of Her Majesty’s mail-carts, the horse having become unmanageable\r\nin consequence of the shafts being broken. In St. Mary’s Church,\r\nLambeth, a gentleman having fallen down in apoplexy, the orderlies\r\nwho were attending Divine service, carried him out into the air, and\r\npromptly procured him medical aid, but unhappily life was extinct. Many\r\ninstances have occurred, however, in which they have rendered essential\r\nservice to the public and to individuals.\r\n\r\n[29] The wages paid are not stated.\r\n\r\n[30] At p. 183 the sum of 18,225_l._ is said to be expended in repairs\r\n_annually_; it should have been _weekly_.\r\n\r\n[31] At p. 185 the traffic of London Bridge is stated to be 13,000\r\nconveyances per hour, instead of per 12 hours.\r\n\r\n[32] The _core_ in this term may be a corruption of the Saxon _Carr_,\r\na rock, rather than that which would at first suggest itself as its\r\norigin, viz., the Latin _cor_, the heart. _Hard-core_ would therefore\r\nmean hard rock-like rubbish, instead of lumps of rubbish having a hard\r\nnucleus or heart.\r\n\r\n[33] The term _rubbish_ is a polite corruption of the original word\r\n_rubbage_, which is still used by uneducated people; _ish_ is an\r\n_adjectival_ termination, as whitish, slavish, brutish, &c., and\r\nis used only in connection with such substantives as are derived\r\nfrom adjectives, as English, Scottish, &c. Whereas the affix age is\r\nstrictly substantival, as sewage, garbage, wharfage, &c., and is found\r\napplied only to adjectives derived from substantives, as _savage_. A\r\nlike polite corruption is found in the word _pudding_, which should\r\nbe strictly _pudden_; the addition of the g is as gross a mistake\r\nas saying _garding_ for _garden_. There is no such verb as to _pud_\r\nwhence could come the substantival participle _pudding_; and the French\r\nword from which we derive our term is _poudin_ without the _g_, like\r\n_jardin_, the root of our _garden_.\r\n\r\n[34] This is the Saxon _sceard_, which means a sheard, remnant, or\r\nfragment, and is from the verb _sceran_, signifying both to shear\r\nand to share or divide. The low Dutch _schaard_ is a piece of pot, a\r\nfragment.\r\n\r\n[35] Lord Bacon’s Hist. of King Henry VII., Works, vol. v. p. 61.\r\n\r\n[36] 25th Henry VIII. cap. 13.\r\n\r\n[37] 5 & 6 Edw.

The _declared_ value is simply the market\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n[53] The official returns as to the number of paupers are most\r\nincomplete and unsatisfactory. In the 10th annual Report of the Poor\r\nLaw Commissioners, p. 480 (1844), a table is printed which is said\r\nto give the returns from the earliest period for which authentic\r\nParliamentary documents have been received, and this sets forth the\r\nnumber of paupers in England and Wales, for the _entire twelve months_\r\nin the years 1803, 1813, 1814, and 1815; then comes a long interval\r\nof “no returns,” and after 1839 we have the numbers for only _three\r\nmonths_ in each year, from 1840 up to 1843; in the first annual Report\r\n(1848) these returns for one quarter in each year are continued up to\r\n1848; and then we get the returns for only two days in each year, the\r\n1st of July and the 1st of January, so that to come to any conclusion\r\namid so much inconsistency is utterly impossible. The numbers above\r\ngiven would have been continued to the present period, could any\r\ncomparison have been instituted. The numbers for the periods (not above\r\ngiven) are--\r\n\r\n  1803              1,040,716}\r\n  1813              1,426,065}    Number of paupers for the\r\n  1814              1,402,576}    entire twelve months.\r\n  1815              1,319,851}\r\n  1849 (1st Jan.)     940,851 }\r\n   „   (1st July)     846,988 }\r\n  1850 (1st Jan.)     889,830 }    Number of paupers for two\r\n   „   (1st July)     796,318 }    separate days in each year.\r\n  1851 (1st Jan.)     829,440 }\r\n\r\n\r\n[54] It might at first appear that, when the work is shifted to the\r\nContinent, there would be a proportionate decrease of the aggregate\r\nquantity at home, but a little reflection will teach us that the\r\nforeigners must take something from us in _exchange_ for their work,\r\nand so increase the quantity of our work in certain respects as much as\r\nthey depress it in others.\r\n\r\n[55] The Great Exhibition, I am informed, produced a very small effect\r\non the consumption of porter; and, according to the official returns,\r\n160,000 gallons less spirits were consumed in the first nine months\r\nof the present year, than in the corresponding months of the last:\r\nthus showing that any occupation of mind or body is incompatible\r\nwith intemperate habits, for drunkenness is essentially the vice of\r\nidleness, or want of something better to do.\r\n\r\n[56] The term _sanc_ in “sanc-work” is the Norman word for blood\r\n(Latin, _sanguis_; French, _sang_), so that “sanc-work” means,\r\nliterally, bloody work, this called either from the sanguinary trade of\r\nthe soldier, or from the blood-red colour of the cloth.\r\n\r\n[57] “Reredos, dossel (_retable_, Fr.; _postergule_, Ital.),” according\r\nto Parker’s Glossary of Architecture, was “the wall or screen at the\r\nback of an altar, seat, &c.; it was usually ornamented with panelling,\r\n&c., especially behind an altar, and sometimes was enriched with\r\na profusion of niches, buttresses, pinnacles, statues, and other\r\ndecorations, which were often painted with brilliant colours.\r\n\r\n“The open fire-hearth, frequently used in ancient domestic halls, was\r\nlikewise called a reredos.\r\n\r\n“In the description of Britain prefixed to Holinshed’s ‘Chronicles,’\r\nwe are told that formerly, before chimneys were common in mean houses,\r\n‘each man made his fire against a reredosse in the hall, where he dined\r\nand dressed his meat.’”\r\n\r\nThe original word would appear to be _dosel_ or _rere-dosel_; for\r\nKelham, in his “Norman Dictionary,” explains the word _doser_ or\r\n_dosel_ to signify a hanging or canopy of silk, silver, or gold work,\r\nunder which kings or great personages sit; also the back of a chair\r\nof state (the word being probably a derivative of the Latin _dorsum_,\r\nthe back. _Dos_, in slang, means a _bed_, a “dossing crib” being a\r\nsleeping-place, and has clearly the same origin). A _rere-dos_ or\r\n_rere-dosel_ would thus appear to have been a _screen_ placed _behind_\r\nanything. I am told, that in the old houses in the north of England,\r\nerections at the back of the fire may, to this day, occasionally be\r\nseen, with an aperture behind for the insertion of plates, and such\r\nother things as may require warming.\r\n\r\nA correspondent says there is “a ‘reredos,’ or open fire-hearth, now\r\nto be seen in the extensive and beautiful ruins of the Abbey of St.\r\nAgatha, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. The ivy now hangs over and\r\npartially conceals this reredos; but its form is tolerably perfect,\r\nand the stones are still coloured by the action of the fire, which\r\nwas extinguished, I need hardly say, by the cold water thrown on such\r\nplaces by Henry VIII.”\r\n\r\n[58] It has been notorious for many years, that flowers will not bloom\r\nin any natural luxuriance, and that fruit will not properly ripen,\r\nin the heart of the city. Whilst this is an unquestionable fact, it\r\nis also a fact, that greatly as suburban dwellings have increased,\r\nand truly as London may be said to have “gone into the country,”\r\nthe greater quantity of the large, excellent, unfailing, and cheap\r\nsupply of the fruits and vegetables in the London “green” markets are\r\ngrown within a circle of from ten to twelve miles from St. Paul’s.\r\nIn the course of my inquiries (in the series of letters on Labour\r\nand the Poor in the _Morning Chronicle_) into the supply, &c., to\r\nthe “green markets” of the metropolis, I was told by an experienced\r\nmarket-gardener, who had friends and connections in several of the\r\nsuburbs, that he fancied, and others in the trade were of the same\r\nopinion, that no gardening could be anything but a failure if attempted\r\nwithin “where the fogs went.” My informant explained to me that the\r\nfogs, so peculiar to London, did not usually extend beyond three or\r\nfour miles from the heart of the city. He was satisfied, he said, that\r\nwithin half a mile or so of this reach of fog the gardener’s labours\r\nmight be crowned with success. He knew nothing of any scientific\r\nreason for his opinion, but as far as a purely London fog extended\r\n(without regard to any mist pervading the whole country as well as\r\nthe neighbourhood of the capital), he thought it was the boundary\r\nwithin which there could be no proper growth of fruit or flowers. That\r\nthe London fog has its _limits_ as regards the manifestation of its\r\ngreatest density, there can be no doubt. My informant was frequently\r\nasked, when on his way home, by omnibus drivers and others whom he\r\nknew, and met on their way to town a few miles from it: “How’s the fog,\r\nsir? _How far?_”\r\n\r\nThe extent of the London fog, then, if the information I have cited be\r\ncorrect, may be considered as indicating that portion of the metropolis\r\nwhere the population, and consequently the smoke, is the thickest, and\r\nwithin which agricultural and horticultural labours cannot meet with\r\nsuccess. “The nuisance of a November fog in London,” Mr. Booth stated\r\nto the Smoke Committee, “is most assuredly increased by the smoke\r\nof the town, arising from furnaces and private fires. It is vapour\r\nsaturated with particles of carbon which causes all that uneasiness and\r\npain in the lungs, and the uneasy sensations which we experience in our\r\nheads. I have no doubt of the density of these fogs arising from this\r\ncarbonaceous matter.”\r\n\r\nThe loss from the impossibility of promoting vegetation in the district\r\nmost subjected to the fog is nothing, as the whole ground is already\r\noccupied for the thousand purposes of a great commercial city. The\r\nmatter is, however, highly curious, as a result of the London smoke.\r\n\r\nConcerning the frequency of fogs in the district of the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the metropolis, it is stated in Weale’s “London,”\r\nthat fogs “appear to be owing, 1st, to the presence of the river; and,\r\n2ndly, to the fact that the superior temperature of the town produces\r\nresults precisely similar to those we find to occur upon rivers and\r\nlakes. The cold damp currents of the atmosphere, which cannot act\r\nupon the air of the country districts, owing to the equality of their\r\nspecific gravity, when they encounter the warmer and lighter strata\r\nover the town, displace the latter, intermixing with it and condensing\r\nthe moisture. Fogs thus are often to be observed in London, whilst the\r\nsurrounding country is entirely free from them. The peculiar colour\r\nof the London fogs appears to be owing to the fact that, during their\r\nprevalence, the ascent of the coal smoke is impeded, and that it is\r\nthus mixed with the condensed moisture of the atmosphere. As is well\r\nknown, they are often so dense as to require the gas to be lighted in\r\nmidday, and they cover the town with a most dingy and depressing pall.\r\nThey also frequently exhibit the peculiarity of increasing density\r\nafter their first formation, which appears to be owing to the descent\r\nof fresh currents of cold air towards the lighter regions of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n“They do not occur when the wind is in a dry quarter, as for instance\r\nwhen it is in the east; notwithstanding that there may be very\r\nconsiderable difference in the temperature of the air and of the water\r\nor the ground. The peculiar odour which attends the London fogs has\r\nnot yet been satisfactorily explained; although the uniformity of its\r\nrecurrence, and its very marked character, would appear to challenge\r\nelaborate examination.”\r\n\r\n[59] The quantity of soot deposited depends greatly on the length,\r\ndraught, and irregular surface of the chimney. The kitchen flue yields\r\nby far the most soot for an equal quantity of coals burnt, because it\r\nis of greater length. The quantity above cited is the average yield\r\nfrom the several chimneys of a house. It will be seen hereafter that\r\nthe quantity collected is only 800,000 bushels; a great proportion\r\nof the chimneys of the poor being seldom swept, and some cleansed by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[60] Soot of coal is said, by Dr. Ure, in his admirable Dictionary of\r\nArts and Manufactures, to contain “sulphate and carbonate of ammonia\r\nalong with bituminous matter.”\r\n\r\n[61] Querying means literally inquiring or asking for work at the\r\ndifferent houses. The “queriers” among the sweeps are a kind of pedlar\r\noperatives.\r\n\r\n[62] In East and West London there are rather more than 32 houses to\r\nthe acre, which gives an average of 151 square yards to each dwelling,\r\nso that, allowing the streets here to occupy one-third of the area, we\r\nhave 100 square yards for the space covered by each house. In Lewisham,\r\nHampstead, and Wandsworth, there is not one house to the acre. The\r\naverage number of houses per acre throughout London is 4.\r\n\r\n[63] _Gully_ here is a corruption of the word _Gullet_, or throat; the\r\nNorman is _guelle_ (Lat. _gula_), and the French, _goulet_; from this\r\nthe word _gully_ appears to be directly derived. A _gully_-drain is\r\nliterally a _gullet_-drain, that is, a drain serving the purposes of a\r\ngullet or channel for liquids, and a gully-hole the mouth, orifice, or\r\nopening to the _gullet_ or gully-drain.\r\n\r\n[64] Of the derivation of the word _Sewer_ there have been many\r\nconjectures, but no approximation to the truth. One of the earliest\r\ninstances I have met with of any detailed mention of sewers, is in\r\nan address delivered by a “Coroner,” whose name does not appear, to\r\n“a jury of sewers.” This address was delivered somewhere between the\r\nyears 1660 and 1670. The coroner having first spoken of the importance\r\nof “Navigation and Drayning” (draining), then came to the question of\r\nsewers.\r\n\r\n“Sewars,” he said, “are to be accounted your grand Issuers of Water,\r\nfrom whence I conceive they carry their name (_Sewars quasi Issuers_).\r\nI shall take his opinion who delivers them to be Currents of Water,\r\nkept in on both sides with banks, and, in some sense, they may be\r\ncalled a certain kind of a little or small river. But as for the\r\nderivation of the word Sewar, from two of our English words, _Sea_ and\r\n_Were_, or, as others will have it, _Sea_ and _Ward_, give me leave,\r\nnow I have mentioned it, to--leave it to your judgments.\r\n\r\n“However, this word _Sewar_ is very famous amongst us, both for giving\r\nthe title of the Commission of Sewars itself, and for being the\r\nordinary name of most of your common water-courses, for Drayning, and\r\ntherefore, I presume, there are none of you of these juries but both\r\nknow--\r\n\r\n“1. What Sewars signify, and also, in particular,\r\n\r\n“2. What they are; and of a thing so generally known, and of such\r\ngeneral use.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Lemon, who gave the world a work on “English Etymology,”\r\nfrom the Greek and Latin, and from the Saxon and Norman, was regarded\r\nas a high authority during the latter part of the last century, when\r\nhis quarto first appeared. The following is his account, under the head\r\n“Sewers”--\r\n\r\n“Skinn. rejects Minsh’s. deriv. of ‘olim scriptum fuisse _seward_\r\nà sea-ward, quod versus mare factæ sunt: longè verisimilius à Fr.\r\nGall. _eauier_; sentina; _incile_, supple. aquarum:’--then why did\r\nnot the Dr. trace this Fr. Gall. _eauier_? if he had, he would have\r\nfound it distorted ab Ὑδωρ, _aqua_; _sewers_ being a species of\r\n_aqueduct_:--Lye, in his Add., gives another deriv., viz. ‘ab Iceland.\r\n_sua_, _colare_; ut existimo; ad quod referre vellem _sewer_; _cloaca_;\r\nper _sordes_ urbis ejiciuntur:’--the very word _sordes_ gives me a hint\r\nthat _sewer_ may be derived à ‘Σαιρω, _vel_ Σαροω, _verro_: nempe quia\r\n_sordes_, quæ _everruntur_ è domo, in unum locum _accumulantur_; R.\r\nΣωρος, _cumulus_: Voss.’--_a collection of sweepings, slop, dirt, &c._”\r\n\r\nBut these are the follies of learning. Had our lexicographers known\r\nthat the vulgar were, as Dr. Latham says, “the conservators of the\r\nSaxon language” with us, they would have sought information from the\r\nword “shore,” which the uneducated, and, consequently, unperverted,\r\ninvariably use in the place of the more polite “sewer”--the common\r\n_sewer_ is always termed by them “the common _shore_.” Now the word\r\n_shore_, in Saxon, is written _score_ and _scor_ (for _c_ = _h_), and\r\nmeans not only a bank, the land immediately next to the sea, but a\r\n_score_, a tally--for they are both substantives, made from the verb\r\n_sceran_ (p. _scear_, _scær_, pp. _scoren_, _gescoren_), to _shear_,\r\ncut off, _share_, divide; and hence they meant, in the one case, the\r\ndivision of the land from the sea; and in the other, a division cut\r\nin a piece of wood, with a view to counting. The substantive _scar_\r\nhas the same origin; as well as the verb to _score_, to cut, to gash.\r\nThe Scandinavian cognates for the Saxon _scor_ may be cited as proofs\r\nof what is here asserted. They are, Icel., _skor_, a notch; Swed.,\r\n_skâra_, a notch; and Dan., _skaar_ and _skure_, a notch, an incision.\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that the word _shore_, in the sense of\r\n_sewer_ (Dan., _skure_; Anglice, _shure_, for _k_ = _h_), originally\r\nmeant merely a _score_ or incision made in the ground, a _ditch_ sunk\r\nwith the view of carrying off the refuse-water, a watercourse, and\r\nconsequently a drain. A sewer is now a covered ditch, or channel for\r\nrefuse water.\r\n\r\n[65] This outlet is known to the flushermen, &c., as “below the backs\r\nof houses,” from its devious course _under the houses_ without pursuing\r\nany direct line parallel with the open part of the streets.\r\n\r\n[66] The following is the analysis of a gallon of sewage, also dried to\r\nevaporation, by Professor Miller:--\r\n\r\n  Ammonia                                3·26\r\n  Phosphoric acid                        0·44\r\n  Potash                                 1·02\r\n  Silica                                 0·54\r\n  Lime                                   7·54\r\n  Magnesia                               1·87\r\n  Common salt                           13·66\r\n  Sulphuric acid                         7·04\r\n  Carbonic acid                          4·41\r\n  Combustible matter, containing\r\n    0·34 nitrogen                        5·80\r\n  Traces of oxide of iron.\r\n                                        -----\r\n    Making in solution                  45·58\r\n                                        -----\r\n  Matters in suspension, consisting of\r\n    combustible matters, sand, lime,\r\n    and oxide of iron                   44·50\r\n\r\n\r\n[67] The following note appears in Mr. Fortescue’s statement:--“In\r\nsome trial works near the metropolis sewer water was applied to land,\r\non the condition that the value of half the extra crop should be taken\r\nas payment. The dressings were only single dressings. The officer\r\nmaking the valuation reported, that there was at the least one sack of\r\nwheat and one load of straw per acre extra from its application on one\r\nbreadth of land; in another, full one quarter of wheat more, and one\r\nload of straw extra per acre. The reports of the effects of sewer-water\r\nin increasing the yield of oats as well as of wheat were equally good.\r\nIt is stated by Captain Vetch that in South America irrigation is used\r\nwith great advantage for wheat.”\r\n\r\n[68] The following statement may, according to the work above alluded\r\nto, be presented as an approximate.\r\n\r\n[69] Rental of the districts now rated.\r\n\r\n[70] Rental of the districts within the active jurisdiction in which\r\nexpenses have been incurred, and which are about to be rated.\r\n\r\n[71] These officers are paid only during the period of service, and are\r\nchiefly engaged on special works.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding officers for London are under the City Commissioners.\r\n\r\n[72] In one of their Reports the Board of Health has spoken of the\r\nyearly cleansing of the cesspools; but a cesspool, I am assured, is\r\nrarely emptied by manual labour, unless it be full, for as the process\r\nis generally regarded as a nuisance, it is resorted to as seldom as\r\npossible. It may, perhaps, be different with the cesspool-emptying by\r\nthe hydraulic process, which is _not_ a nuisance.\r\n\r\n[73] It was ascertained that 3 gallons (half a cubic foot) of water\r\nwould carry off 1 lb. of the more solid excrementitious matter through\r\na 6-inch pipe, with an inclination of 1 in 10.\r\n\r\n[74] Mr. Rammell supplies the following note on the use of “Poudrette.”\r\n\r\n“In connexion with this subject,” he says, “a few observations upon the\r\napplication of poudrette in agricultural process may not be without\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“With regard to the fertilizing properties of this preparation, M.\r\nMaxime Paulet, in his work entitled ‘Théorie et Pratique des Engrais,’\r\ngives a table of the fertilizing qualities of various descriptions\r\nof manure, the value of each being determined by the quantity of\r\nnitrogen it contains. Taking for a standard good farm-yard dung, which\r\ncontains on an average 4 per 1000 of nitrogen, and assuming that 10,000\r\nkilogrammes (about 22,000 lbs. English) of this manure (containing 40\r\nkilogrammes of nitrogen) are necessary to manure one hectare (2-1/2\r\nacres nearly) of land, the quantities of poudrette and of some other\r\nanimal manures required to produce a similar effect would be as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                                       Kilogr.\r\n    “Good farm-yard dung, the quantity usually\r\n  spread upon one hectare of land                      10,000\r\n    Equivalent quantities of human urine, not\r\n  having undergone fermentation                         5,600\r\n    Equivalent quantities of poudrette of Montfaucon    2,550\r\n    Equivalent quantities of mixed human excrements\r\n  (this quantity I have calculated from data given\r\n  in the same work)                                     1,333\r\n    Equivalent quantities of liquid blood of\r\n  the abattoirs                                         1,333\r\n    Equivalent quantities of bones                        650\r\n    Equivalent quantities of average of guano\r\n  (two specimens are given)                               512\r\n    Equivalent quantities of urine of the public\r\n  urinals in fermentation, and incompletely dried         233\r\n\r\n“M. Paulet estimates the loss of the ammoniacal products contained in\r\nthe fæcal matters when they are withdrawn from the cesspools, by the\r\ntime they have been ultimately reduced into poudrette, at from 80 to 90\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n“I have not been able to meet with an analysis of the matters found\r\nin the fixed and movable cesspools of Paris, but in the ‘Cours\r\nd’Agriculture,’ of M. le Comte de Gasparin, I find an analysis by MM.\r\nPayen and Boussingault of some matter taken from the cesspools of\r\nLille, and in the state in which it is ordinarily used in the suburbs\r\nof that city as manure. This matter was found to contain on the average\r\n0·205 per cent of nitrogen, and thus by the rule observed in drawing up\r\nthe above table, 19,512 kilogrammes of it would be necessary to produce\r\nthe same effect upon one hectare of land as the other manures there\r\nmentioned. The wide difference between this quantity and that (1333\r\nkilogrammes) stated for the mixed human excrements in their undiluted\r\nstate, would lead to the conclusion that a very large proportion of\r\nwater was present in the matter sent from Lille, unless we are to\r\nattribute a portion of the difference to the accidental circumstance\r\nof the bad quality of this matter. It appears that this is very\r\nvariable, according to the style of living of the persons producing\r\nit. ‘Upon this subject,’ M. Paulet says, ‘the case of an agriculturist\r\nin the neighbourhood of Paris is cited, who bought the contents of the\r\ncesspools of one of the fashionable restaurants of the Palais Royal.\r\nMaking a profitable speculation of it, he purchased the matter of the\r\ncesspools of several barracks. This bargain, however, resulted in a\r\nloss, for the produce from this last matter came very short of that\r\ngiven by the first.’\r\n\r\n“Poudrette weighs 70 kilogrammes the hectolitre (154 lbs. per 22\r\ngallons), and the quantity usually spread upon one hectare of land\r\n(2-1/2 acres nearly) is 1750 kilogrammes, being at the rate of about\r\n1540 lbs. per acre English measure. It is cast upon the land by the\r\nhand, in the manner that corn is sown.\r\n\r\n“Poudrette packed in sacks very soon destroys them. This is always the\r\ncase, whether it is whole or has been newly prepared.\r\n\r\n“A serious accident occurred in 1818, on board a vessel named the\r\n_Arthur_, which sailed from Rouen with a cargo of poudrette for\r\nGuadaloupe. During the voyage a disease broke out on board which\r\ncarried off half the crew, and left the remainder in a deplorable state\r\nof health when they reached their destination. It attacked also the men\r\nwho landed the cargo; they all suffered in a greater or less degree.\r\nThe poudrette was proved to have been shipped during a wet season, and\r\nto have been exposed before and during shipment, in a manner to allow\r\nit to absorb a considerable quantity of moisture. The accident appears\r\nto have been due to the subsequent fermentation of the mass in the\r\nhold--increased to an intense degree by the moisture it had acquired,\r\nand by the heat of a tropical climate.\r\n\r\n“M. Parent du Châtelet, to whom the matter was referred, recommended\r\nthat to guard against similar accidents in future, the poudrette\r\nintended for exportation, in order to deprive it entirely of humidity,\r\nshould be mixed with an absorbent powder, such as quicklime, and that\r\nit should be packed in casks to protect it from moisture during the\r\nvoyage.”\r\n\r\n[75] “It is in the upper basins,” adds the Reports, “that the first\r\nseparation of the liquids and solids takes place, the latter falling\r\nto the bottom, and the former gradually flowing off through a sluice\r\ninto the lower basins. This first separation, however, is by no means\r\ncomplete, a considerable deposit taking place in the lower basins. The\r\nmass in the upper basins, after three or four years, then appears like\r\na thick mud, half liquid, half solid; it is of depth varying from 12\r\nto 15 feet. In order entirely to get rid of the liquids, deep channels\r\nare then cut across the mass, by which they are drained off, when the\r\ndeposit soon becomes sufficiently stiff to permit of its being dug out\r\nand spread upon the drying-ground, where, to assist the desiccation, it\r\nis turned over two or three times a-day by means of a harrow drawn by a\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n“The time necessary for the requisite desiccation varies a good deal,\r\naccording to the season of the year, the temperature, and the dry or\r\nmoist state of the atmosphere. Ere yet it is entirely deprived of\r\nhumidity, the matter is collected into heaps, varying in size usually\r\nfrom 8 to 10 yards high, and from 60 to 80 yards long, by 25 or 30\r\nyards wide. These heaps or mounds generally remain a twelvemonth\r\nuntouched, sometimes even for two or three years; but as fast as the\r\nmaterial is required, they are worked from one of the sides by means\r\nof pickaxes, shovels, and rakes; the pieces separated are then easily\r\nbroken and reduced to powder, foreign substances being carefully\r\nexcluded. This operation, which is the last the matter undergoes,\r\nis performed by women. The poudrette then appears like a mould of a\r\ngrey-black colour, light, greasy to the touch, finely grained, and\r\ngiving out a particular faint and nauseous odour.\r\n\r\n“The finer particles of matter carried by the liquids into the lower\r\nbasins, and there more gradually deposited in combination with a\r\nprecipitate from the urine, yield a variety of poudrette, preferred, by\r\nthe farmers, for its superior fertilizing properties. In this case the\r\ndrying process is conducted more slowly and with more difficulty than\r\nin the other, but more completely.\r\n\r\n“In general the poudrette is dried with great difficulty; it appears to\r\nhave an extreme affinity for water; few substances give out moisture\r\nmore slowly, or absorb it more greedily from the air.\r\n\r\n“A good deal of heat is generated in the heaps of desiccated matter.\r\nThis is always sensible to the touch, and sometimes results in\r\nspontaneous combustion.\r\n\r\n“The intensity of this heat is not in proportion to the elevation of\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere. It is promoted by moisture. The only\r\nmeans of extinguishing the fire when it is once developed is to turn\r\nover the mass from top to bottom, in order to expose it to the air.\r\nWater thrown upon it, unless in very large quantities, would only\r\nincrease its activity.”\r\n\r\n[76] 4-1/4 heaped bushels each, English measure.\r\n\r\n[77] I did not hear any of the London nightmen or sewermen complain of\r\ninflammation in the eyes, and no such effect was visible; nor that they\r\nsuffered from temporary blindness, or were, indeed, thrown out of work\r\nfrom any such cause; they merely remarked that they were first dazzled,\r\nor “_dazed_,” with the soil. But the labour of the Parisian is far\r\nmore continuous and regular than the London nightman, owing in a great\r\ndegree to the system of _movable cesspools_ in Paris.\r\n\r\n[78] It must be recollected, to account for the greater quantity of\r\nmatter between the cesspools of Paris and London, that the French\r\nfixed cesspool, from the greater average of inmates to each house,\r\nmust necessarily contain about three times and a half as much as that\r\nof a London cesspool. If the dwellers in a Parisian house, instead of\r\naveraging twenty-four, averaged between seven and eight, as in London,\r\nthe cesspool contents in Paris would, at the above rate, be between\r\nfour and five tons (as it is in London) for the average of each house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscribed from the 1967 reprinting of the 1865 edition.\r\n\r\nLarger tables have
