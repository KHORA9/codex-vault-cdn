I therefore\r\nthink, and trust, that it will prove to be an acceptable and readable\r\naddition to photographic literature.\r\n\r\nIt was never intended that this volume should be a text-book, so I have\r\nnot entered into elaborate descriptions of the manipulations of this or\r\nthat process, but have endeavoured to make it a comprehensive and\r\nagreeable summary of all that has been done in the past, and yet convey\r\na perfect knowledge of all the processes as they have appeared and\r\neffected radical changes in the practice of photography.\r\n\r\nThe chronological record of discoveries, inventions, appliances, and\r\npublications connected with the art will, it is hoped, be received and\r\nconsidered as a useful and interesting table of reference; while the\r\nreminiscences, extending over forty years of unbroken contact with every\r\nphase of photography, and some of its pioneers, will form a vital link\r\nbetween the long past and immediate present, which may awaken pleasing\r\nrecollections in some, and give encouragement to others to enter the\r\nfield of experiment, and endeavour to continue the work of evolution.\r\n\r\nAt page 10 it is stated, on the authority of the late Robert Hunt, that\r\nsome of Niepce's early pictures may be seen at the British Museum. That\r\nwas so, but unfortunately it is not so now. On making application, very\r\nrecently, to examine these pictures, I ascertained that they were never\r\nplaced in the care of the curator of the British Museum, but were the\r\nprivate property of the late Dr. Robert Brown, who left them to his\r\ncolleague, John Joseph Bennett, and that at the latter's death they\r\npassed into the possession of his widow. I wrote to the lady making\r\nenquiries about them, but have not been able to trace them further;\r\nthere are, however, two very interesting examples of Niepce's\r\nheliographs, and one photo-etched plate and print, lent by Mr. H. P.\r\nRobinson, on view at South Kensington, in the Western Gallery of the\r\nScience Collection.\r\n\r\nFor the portrait of Thomas Wedgwood, I am indebted to Mr. Godfrey\r\nWedgwood; for that of Joseph Nicephore Niepce, to the Mayor of\r\nChalons-sur-Saone; for the Rev. J. B. Reade's, to Mr. Fox; for Sir John\r\nHerschel's, to Mr. H. H. Cameron; for John Frederick Goddard's, to Dr.\r\nJabez Hogg; and for Frederick Scott Archer's, to Mr. Alfred Cade; and to\r\nall those gentlemen I tender my most grateful acknowledgments.

Scarcely has the period\r\nof an average life passed away since the labours of the successful\r\nexperimentalists began; yet, how few of the present generation of\r\nworkers can lay their fingers on the dates of the birth, christening,\r\nand phases of the delightful vocation they pursue. Many know little or\r\nnothing of the long and weary travail the minds of the discoverers\r\nsuffered before their ingenuity gave birth to the beautiful art-science\r\nby which they live. What form the infant art assumed in the earlier\r\nstages of its life; or when, where, and how, it passed from one phase to\r\nanother until it arrived at its present state of mature and profitable\r\nperfection. Born with the art, as I may say, and having graduated in it,\r\nI could, if I felt so disposed, give an interesting, if not amusing,\r\ndescription of its rise and progress, and the many difficulties and\r\ndisappointments that some of the early practitioners experienced at a\r\ntime when photographic A B C's were not printed; its \"principles and\r\npractice\" anything but familiarly explained; and when the \"dark room\"\r\nwas as dark as the grave, and as poisonous as a charnel-house, and only\r\noccasionally illumined by the glare of a \"bull's-eye.\" But it is not my\r\nintention to enter the domain of romance, and give highly coloured or\r\nextravagant accounts of the growth of so beautiful and fascinating an\r\nart-science. Photography is sufficiently facetious in itself, and too\r\nversatile in its powers of delineation of scenes and character, to\r\nrequire any verbose effort of mine to make it attractive. A record of\r\nbare facts is all I aim at. Whatever is doubtful I shall leave to the\r\nimagination of the reader, or the invention of the romance writer. To\r\narrange in chronological order the various discoveries, inventions, and\r\nimprovements that have made photography what it is; to do honour to\r\nthose who have toiled and given, or sold, the fruits of their labour for\r\nthe advancement of the art; to set at rest, as far as dates can succeed\r\nin doing so, any questionable point or order of precedence of merit in\r\ninvention, application, or modification of a process, and to enable the\r\nphotographic student to make himself acquainted with the epochs of the\r\nart, is the extent of my ambition in compiling these records.\r\n\r\nWith the hope of rendering this work readily referable and most\r\ncomprehensive, I shall divide it into four periods. The first will deal\r\nbroadly and briefly with such facts as can be ascertained that in any\r\nway bear on the accidental discovery, early researches, and ultimate\r\nsuccess of the pioneers of photography.\r\n\r\nThe second will embrace a fuller description of their successes and\r\nresults. The third will be devoted to a consideration of patents and\r\nimpediments; and the fourth to the rise and development of photographic\r\nliterature and art. A strict chronological arrangement of each period\r\nwill be maintained, and it is hoped that the advantages to be derived\r\nfrom travelling some of the same ground over again in the various\r\ndivisions of the subject will fully compensate the reader, and be\r\naccepted as sufficient excuse for any unavoidable repetition that may\r\nappear in the work. With these few remarks I shall at once enter upon\r\nthe task of placing before the reader in chronological order the origin,\r\nrise, progress, and development of the science and art of photography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD.\r\n\r\nTHE DARK AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than three hundred years have elapsed since the influence and\r\nactinism of light on chloride of silver was observed by the alchemists\r\nof the sixteenth century. This discovery was unquestionably the first\r\nthing that suggested to the minds of succeeding chemists and men of\r\nscience the possibility of obtaining pictures of solid bodies on a plane\r\nsurface previously coated with a silver salt by means of the sun's rays;\r\nbut the alchemists were too much absorbed in their vain endeavours to\r\nconvert the base metals into royal ones to seize the hint, and they lost\r\nthe opportunity of turning the silver compounds with which they were\r\nacquainted into the mine of wealth it eventually became in the\r\nnineteenth century. Curiously enough, a mechanical invention of the same\r\nperiod was afterwards employed, with a very trifling modification, for\r\nthe production of the earliest sun-pictures. This was the camera-obscura\r\ninvented by Roger Bacon in 1297, and improved by a physician in Padua,\r\nGiovanni Baptista Porta, about 1500, and afterwards remodelled by Sir\r\nIsaac Newton.\r\n\r\nTwo more centuries passed away before another step was taken towards the\r\nrevelation of the marvellous fact that Nature possessed within herself\r\nthe power to delineate her own beauties, and, as has recently been\r\nproved, that the sun could depict his own terrible majesty with a\r\nrapidity and fidelity the hand of man could never attain. The second\r\nstep towards this grand achievement of science was the construction of\r\nthe double achromatic combination of lenses by J. Dolland. With single\r\ncombinations of lenses, such pictures as we see of ourselves to-day, and\r\nsuch portraits of the sun as the astronomers obtained during the late\r\ntotal eclipse, could never have been produced. J. Dolland, the eminent\r\noptician, was born in London 1706, and died 1762; and had he not made\r\nthat important improvement in the construction of lenses, the eminent\r\nphotographic opticians of the present day might have lived and died\r\nunknown to wealth and fame.\r\n\r\nThe observations of the celebrated Swedish chemist, Scheele, formed the\r\nnext interesting link between the simple and general blackening of a\r\nlump of chloride of silver, and the gradations of blackening which\r\nultimately produced the photographic picture on a piece of paper\r\npossessing a prepared surface of nitrate of silver and chloride of\r\nsodium in combination. Scheele discovered in 1777 that the blackening of\r\nthe silver compound was due to the reducing power of light, and that the\r\nblack deposit was _reduced silver_; and it is precisely the same effect\r\nof the action of light upon chloride of silver passing through the\r\nvarious densities of the negative that produces the beautiful\r\nphotographic prints with which we are all familiar at the present time.\r\nScheele was also the first to discover and make known the fact that\r\nchloride of silver was blackened or reduced to various depths by the\r\nvarying action of the prismatic colours. He fixed a glass prism in a\r\nwindow, allowed the refracted sunbeams to fall on a piece of paper\r\nstrewn with _luna cornua_--fused chloride of silver--and saw that the\r\nviolet ray was more active than any of the other colours. Anyone, with a\r\npiece of sensitised paper and a prism, or piece of a broken lustre, can\r\nrepeat and see for themselves Scheele's interesting discovery; and\r\nanyone that can draw a head or a flower may catch a sunbeam in a small\r\nmagnifying glass, and make a drawing on sensitised paper with a pencil,\r\nas long as the sun is distant from the earth. It is the old story of\r\nColumbus and the egg--easy to do when you are shown or told how.\r\n\r\nCharles William Scheele was born at Stralsund, Sweden, December 19th,\r\n1742, and died at Koeping, on lake Moeler, May 21st, 1786. He was the\r\nreal father of photography, for he produced the first photographic\r\npicture on record without camera and without lens, with the same\r\nchemical compound and the same beautiful and wonderful combination of\r\nnatural colours which we now employ. Little did he dream what was to\r\nfollow. But photography, like everything else in this world, is a\r\nprocess of evolution.\r\n\r\nSenebier followed up Scheele's experiments with the solar spectrum, and\r\nascertained that chloride of silver was darkened by the violet ray in\r\nfifteen minutes, while the red rays were sluggish, and required twenty\r\nminutes to produce the same result.\r\n\r\nJohn Wm. Ritter, born at Samitz, in Silesia, corroborated the\r\nexperiments of Scheele, and discovered that chloride of silver was\r\nblackened beyond the spectrum on the violet side. He died in 1810; but\r\nhe had observed what is now called the fluorescent rays of the\r\nspectrum--invisible rays which unquestionably exert themselves in the\r\ninterests and practice of photography.\r\n\r\nMany other experiments were made by other chemists and philosophers on\r\nthe influence of light on various substances, but none of them had any\r\ndirect bearing on the subject under consideration until Count Rumford,\r\nin 1798, communicated to the Royal Society his experiments with chloride\r\nof gold. Count Rumford wetted a piece of taffeta ribbon with a solution\r\nof chloride of gold, held it horizontally over the clear flame of a wax\r\ncandle, and saw that the heat decomposed the gold solution, and stained\r\nthe ribbon a beautiful purple. Though no revived gold was visible, the\r\nribbon appeared to be coated with a rich purple enamel, which showed a\r\nmetallic lustre of great brilliancy when viewed in the sunlight; but its\r\nphotographic value lay in the circumstance of the hint it afterwards\r\nafforded M. Fizeau in applying a solution of chloride of gold, and, by\r\nmeans of heat, depositing a fine film of metallic gold on the surface of\r\nthe Daguerreotype image, thereby increasing the brilliancy and\r\npermanency of that form of photographic picture. A modification of M.\r\nFizeau's chloride of gold \"fixing process\" is still used to tone, and\r\nimparts a rich purple colour to photographic prints on plain and\r\nalbumenized papers.\r\n\r\nIn 1800, Dr. Herschel's \"Memoirs on the Heating Power of the Solar\r\nSpectrum\" were published, and out of his observations on the various\r\neffects of differently coloured darkening glasses arose the idea that\r\nthe chemical properties of the prismatic colours, and coloured glass,\r\nmight be as different as those which related to heat and light. His\r\nsuspicions were ultimately verified, and hence the use of yellow or ruby\r\nglass in the windows of the \"dark room,\" as either of those coloured\r\nglasses admit the luminous ray and restrain the violet or active\r\nphotographic ray, and allow all the operations that would otherwise have\r\nto be performed in the dark, to be seen and done in comfort, and without\r\ninjury to the sensitive film.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Dr. Wollaston, in 1802, had very little reference to\r\nphotography beyond his examination of the chemical action of the rays of\r\nthe spectrum, and his observation that the yellow stain of gum guaiacum\r\nwas converted to a green colour in the violet rays, and that the red\r\nrays rapidly destroyed the green tint the violet rays had generated.\r\n\r\n1802 is, however, a memorable year in the dark ages of photography, and\r\nthe disappointment of those enthusiastic and indefatigable pursuers of\r\nthe sunbeam must have been grievous indeed, when, after years of labour,\r\nthey found the means of catching shadows as they fell, and discovered\r\nthat they could not keep them.\r\n\r\nThomas Wedgwood, son of the celebrated potter, was not only the first\r\nthat obtained photographic impressions of objects, but the first to make\r\nthe attempt to obtain sun-pictures in the true sense of the word.\r\nScheele had obtained the first photographic picture of the solar\r\nspectrum, but it was by accident, and while pursuing other chemical\r\nexperiments; whereas Wedgwood went to work avowedly to make the sunbeam\r\nhis slave, to enlist the sun into the service of art, and to compel the\r\nsun to illustrate art, and to depict nature more faithfully than art had\r\never imitated anything illumined by the sun before. How far he succeeded\r\neveryone should know, and no student of photography should ever tire of\r\nreading the first published account of his fascinating pastime or\r\ndelightful vocation, if it were but to remind him of the treasures that\r\nsurround him, and the value of hyposulphite of soda. What would Thomas\r\nWedgwood not have given for a handful of that now common commodity?\r\nThere is a mournfulness in the sentence relative to the evanescence of\r\nthose sun-pictures in the Memoir by Wedgwood and Davy that is peculiarly\r\nimpressive and desponding contrasted with our present notions of\r\ninstability. We know that sun-pictures will, at the least, last for\r\nyears, while they knew that at the most they would endure but for a few\r\nhours. The following extracts from the Memoir published in June, 1802,\r\nwill, it is hoped, be found sufficiently interesting and in place here\r\nto justify their insertion.\r\n\r\n\"White paper, or white leather moistened with solution of nitrate of\r\nsilver, undergoes no change when kept in a dark place, but on being\r\nexposed to the daylight it speedily changes colour, and after passing\r\nthrough different shades of grey and brown becomes at length nearly\r\nblack.... In the direct beams of the sun, two or three minutes are\r\nsufficient to produce the full effect, in the shade several hours are\r\nrequired, and light transmitted through different coloured glasses acts\r\nupon it with different degrees of intensity. Thus it is found that red\r\nrays, or the common sunbeams passed through red glass, have very little\r\naction upon it; yellow and green are more efficacious, but blue and\r\nviolet light produce the most decided and powerful effects.... When the\r\nshadow of any figure is thrown upon the prepared surface, the part\r\nconcealed by it remains white, and the other parts speedily become dark.\r\nFor copying paintings on glass, the solution should be applied on\r\nleather, and in this case it is more readily acted on than when paper is\r\nused. After the colour has been once fixed on the leather or paper, it\r\ncannot be removed by the application of water, or water and soap, and it\r\nis in a high degree permanent. The copy of a painting or the profile,\r\nimmediately after being taken, must be kept in an obscure place; it may\r\nindeed be examined in the shade, but in this case the exposure should be\r\nonly for a few minutes; by the light of candles or lamps as commonly\r\nemployed it is not sensibly affected.\r\n\r\n\"No attempts that have been made to prevent the uncoloured parts of the\r\ncopy or profile from being acted upon by the light have as yet been\r\nsuccessful. They have been covered by a thin coating of fine varnish,\r\nbut this has not destroyed their susceptibility of becoming coloured,\r\nand even after repeated washings, sufficient of the active part of the\r\nsaline matter will adhere to the white parts of leather or paper to\r\ncause them to become dark when exposed to the rays of the sun....\r\n\r\n\"The images formed by means of a camera-obscura have been found to be too\r\nfaint to produce, in any moderate time, an effect upon the nitrate of\r\nsilver. To copy these images was the first object of Mr. Wedgwood, in\r\nhis researches on the subject, and for this purpose he first used the\r\nnitrate of silver, which was mentioned to him by a friend, as a\r\nsubstance very sensible to the influence of light; but all his numerous\r\nexperiments as to their primary end proved unsuccessful.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing extracts from the first lecture on photography that\r\never was delivered or published, it will be seen that those two eminent\r\nphilosophers and experimentalists despaired of obtaining pictures in the\r\ncamera-obscura, and of rendering the pictures obtained by superposition,\r\nor cast shadows, in any degree permanent, and that they were utterly\r\nignorant and destitute of any fixing agents. No wonder, then, that all\r\nfurther attempts to pursue these experiments should, for a time, be\r\nabandoned in England. Although Thomas Wedgwood's discoveries were not\r\npublished until 1802, he obtained his first results in 1791, and does\r\nnot appear to have made any appreciable advance during the remainder of\r\nhis life. He was born in 1771, and died in 1805. Sir Humphry Davy was\r\nborn at Penzance 1778, and died at Geneva in 1828, so that neither of\r\nthem lived to see the realization of their hopes.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Wedgwood and Davy relinquished their investigation,\r\nthe subject appears to have lain dormant until 1814, when Joseph\r\nNicephore Niepce, of Chalons-sur-Saone, commenced a series of experiments\r\nwith various resins, with the object of securing or retaining in a\r\npermanent state the pictures produced in the camera-obscura, and in\r\n1824, L. J. M. Daguerre turned his attention to the same subject. These\r\ntwo investigators appear to have carried on their experiments in\r\ndifferent ways, and in total ignorance of the existence and pursuits of\r\nthe other, until the year 1826, when they accidentally became acquainted\r\nwith each other and the nature of their investigations. Their\r\nintroduction and reciprocal admiration did not, however, induce them to\r\nexchange their ideas, or reveal the extent of their success in the\r\nresearches on which they were occupied, and which both were pursuing so\r\nsecretly and guardedly. They each preserved a marked reticence on the\r\nsubject for a considerable time, and it was not until a deed of\r\npartnership was executed between them that they confided their hopes and\r\nfears, their failures with this substance, and their prospects of\r\nsuccess with that; and even after the execution of the deed of\r\npartnership they seem to have jealously withheld as much of their\r\nknowledge as they decently could under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of 1827 M. Niepce visited England, and we receive the\r\nfirst intimation of his success in the production of light-drawn\r\npictures from a note addressed to Mr. Bauer, of Kew. It is rather\r\ncurious and flattering to find that the earliest intimation of the\r\nFrenchman's success is given in England. The note which M. Niepce wrote\r\nto Mr. Bauer is in French, but the following is a translation of the\r\ninteresting announcement:--\"Kew, 19th November, 1827. Sir,--When I left\r\nFrance to reside here, I was engaged in researches on the way to retain\r\nthe image of objects by the action of light. I have obtained some\r\nresults which make me eager to proceed.... Nicephore Niepce.\" This is\r\nthe first recorded announcement of his partial success.\r\n\r\nIn the following December he communicated with the Royal Society of\r\nLondon, and showed several pictures on metal plates. Most of these\r\npictures were specimens of his successful experiments with various\r\nresins, and the subjects were rendered visible to the extent which the\r\nlight had assisted in hardening portions of the resin-covered plates.\r\nSome were etchings, and had been subjected to the action of acid after\r\nthe design had been impressed by the action of light. Several of these\r\nspecimens, I believe, are still extant, and may be seen on application\r\nto the proper official at the British Museum. M. Niepce named these\r\nresults of his researches Heliography, and Mr. Robert Hunt gives their\r\nnumber, and a description of each subject, in his work entitled,\r\n\"Researches on Light.\" M. Niepce met with some disappointment in England\r\non account of the Royal Society refusing to receive his communication as\r\na secret, and he returned to France rather hurriedly. In a letter dated\r\n\"Chalons-sur-Saone, 1st March, 1828,\" he says, \"We arrived here 26th\r\nFebruary\"; and, in a letter written by Daguerre, February 3rd, 1828, we\r\nfind that savant consoling his brother experimentalist for his lack of\r\nencouragement in England.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1829, the two French investigators joined issue by\r\nexecuting a deed of co-partnery, in which they agreed to prosecute their\r\nresearches in future in mutual confidence and for their joint advantage;\r\nbut their interchange of thought and experience does not appear to have\r\nbeen of much value or advantage to the other; for an examination of the\r\ncorrespondence between MM. Niepce and Daguerre tends to show that the\r\none somewhat annoyed the other by sticking to his resins, and the other\r\none by recommending the use of iodine. M. Niepce somewhat ungraciously\r\nexpresses regret at having wasted so much time in experimenting with\r\niodine at M. Daguerre's suggestion, but ultimate results fully justified\r\nDaguerre's recommendation, and proved that he was then on the right\r\ntrack, while M. Niepce's experiments with resins, asphaltum, and\r\nother substances terminated in nothing but tedious manipulations,\r\nlengthy exposures, and unsatisfactory results. To M. Niepce, most\r\nunquestionably, is due the honour of having produced the first permanent\r\nsun-pictures, for we have seen that those obtained by Wedgwood and Davy\r\nwere as fleeting as a shadow, while those exhibited by M. Niepce in 1827\r\nare still in their original condition, and, imperfect as they are, they\r\nare likely to retain their permanency for ever. Their fault lay in\r\nneither possessing beauty nor commercial applicability.\r\n\r\nAs M. Niepce died at Chalons-sur-Saone in 1833, and does not appear to\r\nhave improved his process much, if any, after entering into partnership\r\nwith M. Daguerre, and as I may not have occasion to allude to him or his\r\nresearches again, I think this will be the most fitting place to give a\r\nbrief description of his process, and his share in the labours of\r\nbringing up the wonderful baby of science, afterwards named Photography,\r\nto a safe and ineffaceable period of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe Heliographic process of M. Niepce consists of a solution of\r\nasphaltum, bitumen of Judea, being spread on metal or glass plates,\r\nsubmitted to the action of light either by superposition or in the\r\ncamera, and the unaffected parts dissolved away afterwards by means of a\r\nsuitable solvent. But, in case any student of photography should like to\r\nproduce one of the first form of permanent sun-pictures, I shall give\r\nhere the details of M. Niepce's own _modus operandi_ for preparing the\r\nsolution of bitumen and coating the plate:--\r\n\r\n\"I about half fill a wine-glass with this pulverised bitumen; I pour\r\nupon it, drop by drop, the essential oil of lavender until the bitumen\r\nis completely saturated. I afterwards add as much more of the essential\r\noil as causes the whole to stand about three lines above the mixture,\r\nwhich is then covered and submitted to a gentle heat until the essential\r\noil is fully impregnated with the colouring matter of the bitumen. If\r\nthis varnish is not of the required consistency, it is to be allowed to\r\nevaporate slowly, without heat, in a shallow dish, care being taken to\r\nprotect it from moisture, by which it is injured and at last decomposed.\r\nIn winter, or in rainy weather, the precaution is doubly necessary. A\r\ntablet of plated silver, or well cleaned and warm glass, is to be highly\r\npolished, on which a thin coating of the varnish is to be applied cold,\r\nwith a light roll of very soft skin; this will impart to it a fine\r\nvermilion colour, and cover it with a very thin and equal coating. The\r\nplate is then placed upon heated iron, which is wrapped round with\r\nseveral folds of paper, from which, by this method, all moisture had\r\nbeen previously expelled. When the varnish has ceased to simmer, the\r\nplate is withdrawn from the heat, and left to cool and dry in a gentle\r\ntemperature, and protected from a damp atmosphere. In this part of the\r\noperation a light disc of metal, with a handle in the centre, should be\r\nheld before the mouth, in order to condense the moisture of the breath.\"\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing description it will be observed how much importance M.\r\nNiepce attached to the necessity of protecting the solution and prepared\r\nplate from moisture, and that no precautions are given concerning the\r\neffect of white light. It must be remembered, however, that the\r\nmaterial employed was very insensitive, requiring many hours of exposure\r\neither in the camera or under a print or drawing placed in contact with\r\nthe prepared surface, and consequently such precaution might not have\r\nbeen deemed necessary. Probably M. Niepce worked in a subdued light, but\r\nthere can be no doubt about the necessity of conducting both the\r\nforegoing operations in yellow light. Had M. Niepce performed his\r\noperations in a non-actinic light, the plates would certainly have been\r\nmore sensitive, and the unacted-on parts would have been more soluble;\r\nthus rendering both the time of exposure and development more rapid.\r\n\r\nAfter the plate was prepared and dried, it was exposed in the camera, or\r\nby superposition, under a print, or other suitable subject, that would\r\nlie flat. For the latter, an exposure of two or three hours in bright\r\nsunshine was necessary, and the former required six or eight hours in a\r\nstrong light. Even those prolonged exposures did not produce a visible\r\nimage, and the resultant picture was not revealed to view until after a\r\ntedious process of dissolving, for it could scarcely be called\r\ndevelopment. M. Niepce himself says, \"The next operation then is to\r\ndisengage the _shrouded_ imagery, and this is accomplished by a\r\nsolvent.\" The solvent consisted of one measure of the essential oil of\r\nlavender and ten of oil of white petroleum or benzole. On removing the\r\ntablet from the camera or other object, it was plunged into a bath of\r\nthe above solvent, and left there until the parts not hardened by light\r\nwere dissolved. When the picture was fully revealed, it was placed at an\r\nangle to drain, and finished by washing it in water.\r\n\r\nExcept for the purpose of after-etching, M. Niepce's process was of\r\nlittle commercial value then, but it has since been of some service in\r\nthe practice of photo-lithography. That, I think, is the fullest extent\r\nof the commercial or artistic advantages derived from the utmost success\r\nof M. Niepce's discoveries; but what he considered his failures, the\r\nfact that he employed copper plates coated with silver for his\r\nheliographic tablets, and endeavoured to darken the clean or clear parts\r\nof the silvered plates with the fumes of iodine for the sake of contrast\r\nonly, may be safely accepted as the foundation of Daguerre's ultimate\r\nsuccess in discovering the extremely beautiful and workable process\r\nknown as the Daguerreotype.\r\n\r\nM. Niepce appears to have done very little more towards perfecting the\r\nheliographic process after joining Daguerre; but the latter effected\r\nsome improvements, and substituted for the bitumen of Judea the residuum\r\nobtained by evaporating the essential oil of lavender, without, however,\r\nattaining any important advance in that direction. After the death of M.\r\nNicephore Niepce, a new agreement was entered into by his son, M.\r\nIsidore Niepce, and M. Daguerre, and we must leave those two\r\nexperimentalists pursuing their discoveries in France while we return to\r\nEngland to pick up the chronological links that unite the history of\r\nthis wonderful discovery with the time that it was abandoned by Wedgwood\r\nand Davy, and the period of its startling and brilliant realization.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, Mr. Henry Fox Talbot, of Lacock Abbey, Wilts, \"began to put in\r\npractice,\" as he informs us in his memoir read before the Royal Society,\r\na method which _he_ \"had _devised_ some time previously, for employing\r\nto purposes of utility the very curious property which has been long\r\nknown to chemists to be possessed by the nitrate of silver--namely, to\r\ndiscolouration when exposed to the violet rays of light.\" The statement\r\njust quoted places us at once on the debateable ground of our subject,\r\nand compels us to pause and consider to what extent photography is\r\nindebted to Mr. Talbot for its further development at this period and\r\nfive years subsequently. In the first place, it is not to be supposed\r\nfor a moment that a man of Mr. Talbot's position and education could\r\npossibly be ignorant of what had been done by Mr. Thomas Wedgwood and\r\nSir Humphry Davy. Their experiments were published in the Journal of\r\nthe Royal Institution of Great Britain in June, 1802, and Mr. Talbot or\r\nsome of his friends could not have failed to have seen or heard of those\r\npublished details; and, in the second place, a comparison between the\r\nlast records of Wedgwood and Davy's experiments, and the first published\r\ndetails of Mr. Talbot's process, shows not only that the two processes\r\nare identically the same, but that Mr. Talbot published his process\r\nbefore he had made a single step in advance of Wedgwood and Davy's\r\ndiscoveries; and that his fixing solution was not a fixer at all, but\r\nsimply a retardant that delayed the gradual disappearance of the picture\r\nonly a short time longer. Mr. Talbot has generally been credited with\r\nthe honour of producing the first permanent sun-pictures on paper; but\r\nthere are grave reasons for doubting the justice of that honour being\r\nentirely, if at all, due to him, and the following facts and extracts\r\nwill probably tend to set that question at rest, and transfer the laurel\r\nto another brow.\r\n\r\nTo the late Rev. J. B. Reade is incontestably due the honour of having\r\nfirst applied tannin as an accelerator, and hyposulphite of soda as a\r\nfixing agent, to the production and retention of light-produced\r\npictures; and having first obtained an ineffaceable photograph upon\r\npaper. Mr. Talbot's gallate of silver process was not patented or\r\npublished till 1841; whereas the Rev. J. B. Reade produced paper\r\nnegatives by means of gallic acid and nitrate of silver in 1837. It will\r\nbe remembered that Mr. Wedgwood had discovered and stated that the\r\nchloride of silver was more sensitive when applied to white leather, and\r\nMr. Reade, by inductive reasoning, came to the conclusion that tanned\r\npaper and silver would be more sensitive to light than ordinary paper\r\ncoated with nitrate of silver could possibly be. As the reverend\r\nphilosopher's ideas on that subject are probably the first that ever\r\nimpregnated the mind of man, and as his experiments and observations are\r\nthe very earliest in the pursuit of a gallic acid accelerator and\r\ndeveloper, I will give them in his own words.--\"No one can dispute my\r\nclaim to be the first to suggest the use of gallic acid as a sensitiser\r\nfor prepared paper, and hyposulphite of soda as a fixer. These are the\r\nkeystones of the arch at which Davy and Young had laboured--or, as I may\r\nsay in the language of another science, we may vary the tones as we\r\nplease, but here is the fundamental base. My use of gallate of silver\r\nwas the result of an inference from Wedgwood's experiments with leather,\r\n'which is more readily acted upon than paper' (_Journal of the Royal\r\nInstitution_, vol. i., p. 171). Mrs. Reade was so good as to give me a\r\npair of light-coloured leather gloves, that I might repeat Wedgwood's\r\nexperiment, and, as my friend Mr. Ackerman reminds me, her little\r\nobjection to let me have a second pair led me to say, 'Then I will tan\r\npaper.' Accordingly I used an infusion of galls in the first instance in\r\nthe early part of the year 1837, when I was engaged in taking\r\nphotographs of microscopic objects. By a new arrangement of lenses in\r\nthe solar microscope, I produced a convergence of the rays of light,\r\nwhile the rays of heat, owing to their different refractions, were\r\nparallel or divergent. This fortunate dispersion of the calorific rays\r\nenabled me to use objects mounted in balsam, as well as cemented\r\nachromatic object glasses; and, indeed, such was the coolness of the\r\nillumination, that even _infusoria_ in single drops of water were\r\nperfectly happy and playful (_vide_ abstracts of the 'Philosophical\r\nTransactions,' December 22nd, 1836). The continued expense of an\r\nartist--though, at first, I employed my friend, Lens Aldons--to copy the\r\npictures on the screen was out of the question. I therefore fell back,\r\nbut without any sanguine expectations as to the result, upon the\r\nphotographic process adopted by Wedgwood, with which I happened to be\r\nwell acquainted. It was a _weary while_, however, before any\r\nsatisfactory impression was made, either on chloride or nitrate paper. I\r\nsucceeded better with the leather; but my fortunate inability to\r\nreplenish the little stock of this latter article induced me to apply\r\nthe tannin solution to paper, and thus I was at once placed, by a very\r\ndecided step, in advance of earlier experimenters, and I had the\r\npleasure of succeeding where Talbot acknowledges that he failed.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally enough, the solution which I used at first was too strong,\r\nbut, if you have ever been in what I may call _the agony of a find_, you\r\ncan conceive my sensations on witnessing the unwilling paper become in a\r\nfew seconds almost as black as my hat. There was just a passing glimpse\r\nof outline, 'and in a moment all was dark.' It was evident, however,\r\nthat I was in possession of all, and more than all, I wanted, and that\r\nthe dilution of so powerful an accelerator would probably give\r\nsuccessful results. The large amount of dilution greatly surprised me;\r\nand, indeed, before I obtained a satisfactory picture, the quantity of\r\ngallic acid in the infusion must have been quite homoeopathic; but\r\nthis is in exact accordance with modern practice and known laws. In\r\nreference to this point, Sir John Herschel, writing from Slough, in\r\nApril, 1840, says to Mr. Redman, then of Peckham (where I had resided),\r\n'I am surprised at the weak solution employed, and how, with such, you\r\nhave been able to get a depth of shadow sufficient for so very sharp a\r\nre-transfer is to me marvellous.' I may speak of Mr. Redmond as a\r\nphotographic pupil of mine, and at my request, he communicated the\r\nprocess to Sir John, which, 'on account of the extreme clearness and\r\nsharpness of the results,' to use Sir John's words, much interested him.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Diamond also, whose labours are universally appreciated, first saw\r\nmy early attempts at Peckham in 1837, and heard of my use of gallate of\r\nsilver, and was thus led to adopt what Admiral Smyth then called 'a\r\nquick mode of taking bad pictures'; but, as I told the Admiral in reply,\r\nhe was born a _baby_. Whether our philosophical baby is 'out of its\r\nteens' may be a question; at all events, it is a very fine child, and\r\nhandles the pencil of nature with consummate skill.\r\n\r\n\"But of all the persons who heard of my new accelerator, it is most\r\nimportant to state that my old and valued friend, the late Andrew Ross,\r\ntold Mr. Talbot how first of all, by means of the solar microscope, I\r\nthrew the image of the object on prepared paper, and then, while the\r\npaper was yet wet, washed it over with the infusion of galls, when a\r\nsufficiently dense negative was quickly obtained. In the celebrated\r\ntrial, \"Talbot _versus_ Laroche,\" Mr. Talbot, in his cross-examination,\r\nand in an almost breathless court, acknowledged that he had received\r\nthis information from Ross, and from that moment it became the\r\nunavoidable impression that he was scarcely justified in taking out a\r\npatent for applying my accelerator to any known photogenic paper.\r\n\r\n\"The three known papers were those impregnated with the nitrate,\r\nchloride, and the iodide of silver--the two former used by Wedgwood and\r\nYoung, and the latter by Davy. It is true that Talbot says of the iodide\r\nof silver that it is quite insensitive to light, and so it is as he\r\nmakes it; but when he reduces it to the condition described by\r\nDavy--viz., affected by the presence of a little free nitrate of\r\nsilver--then he must acknowledge, with Davy, that 'it is far more\r\nsensitive to the action of light than either the nitrate or the muriate,\r\nand is evidently a distinct compound.' In this state, also, the infusion\r\nof galls or gallic acid is, as we all know, most decided and\r\ninstantaneous, and so I found it to be in my early experiments. Of\r\ncourse I tried the effects of my accelerator on many salts of silver,\r\nbut especially upon the iodide, in consequence of my knowledge of Davy's\r\npapers on iodine in the 'Philosophical Transactions.' These I had\r\npreviously studied, in conjunction with my chemical friend, Mr. Hodgson,\r\nthen of Apothecaries' Hall. I did not, however, use iodised paper, which\r\nis well described by Talbot in the _Philosophical Magazine_ for March,\r\n1838, as a _substitute_ for other sensitive papers, but only as one\r\namong many experiments alluded to in my letter to Mr. Brayley.\r\n\r\n\"My pictures were exhibited at the Royal Society, and also at Lord\r\nNorthampton's, at his lordship's request, in April, 1839, when Mr.\r\nTalbot also exhibited his. In my letter to Mr. Brayley, I did not\r\ndescribe iodised pictures, and, therefore, it was held that exhibition\r\nin the absence of description left the process legally unknown. Mr.\r\nTalbot consequently felt justified in taking out a patent for uniting my\r\n_known_ accelerator with Davy's _known_ sensitive silver compound,\r\nadopting my method (already communicated to him) with reference to\r\nWedgwood's papers, and adding specific improvements in manipulation.\r\nWhatever varied opinion may consequently be formed as to the defence of\r\nthe patent in court, there can be but one as to the skill of the\r\npatentee.\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious that, in the process so conducted by me with the solar\r\nmicroscope, I was virtually _within_ my camera, standing between the\r\nobject and the prepared paper. Hence the exciting and developing\r\nprocesses were conducted under _one operation_ (subsequently patented by\r\nTalbot), and the fact of a latent image being brought out was not forced\r\nupon my attention. I did, however, perceive this phenomenon upon one\r\noccasion, after I had been suddenly called away, when taking an\r\nimpression of the _Trientalis Europaea_--and surprised enough I was, and\r\nstood in astonishment to look at it. But with all this, I was only, as\r\nthe judge said, \"_very hot_.\" I did not realize the _master fact_ that\r\nthe latent image which had been developed was the basis of photographic\r\nmanipulation. The merit of this discovery is Talbot's, and his only, and\r\nI honour him greatly for his skill and earlier discernment. I was,\r\nindeed, myself fully aware that the image darkened under the influence\r\nof my sensitiser, while I placed my hand before the lens of the\r\ninstrument to stop out the light; and my solar mezzotint, as I then\r\ntermed it, was, in fact, brought out and perfected under my own eye by\r\nthe agency of gallic acid in the infusion, rather than by the influence\r\nof direct solar action. But the notion of developing a latent image in\r\nthese microscopic photographs never crossed my mind, even after I had\r\nwitnessed such development in the _Trientalis Europaea_. My original\r\nnotion was that the infusion of galls, added to the wet chloride or\r\nnitrate paper while the picture was thrown upon it, produced only a new\r\nand highly sensitive compound; whereas, by its peculiar and continuous\r\naction after the first impact of light on the now sensitive paper, I was\r\nalso, as Talbot has shown, employing its property of development as well\r\nas excitement. My ignorance of its properties was no bar to its action.\r\nHowever, I threw the _ball_, and Talbot caught it, and no man can be\r\nmore willing than myself to acknowledge our obligations to this\r\ndistinguished photographer. He compelled the world to listen to him, and\r\nhe had something worth hearing to communicate; and it is a sufficient\r\nreturn to me that he publicly acknowledged his obligation to me, with\r\nreference to what Sir David Brewster calls 'an essential part of his\r\npatent' (_vide North British Review_, No. 14 article--'Photography').\r\n\r\n\"Talbot did not patent my valuable fixer. Here I had the advantage of\r\nhaving published my use of hyposulphite of soda, which Mr. Hodgson made\r\nfor me in 1837, when London did not contain an ounce of it for sale. The\r\nearly operators had no fixer; that was _their fix_; and, so far as any\r\nrecord exists, they got no further in this direction than 'imagining\r\nsome experiments on the subject!' I tried ammonia, but it acted too\r\nenergetically on the picture itself to be available for the purpose. It\r\nled me, however, to the ammonia nitrate process of printing positives, a\r\ndescription of which process (though patented by Talbot in 1843) I sent\r\nto a photographic brother in 1839, and a quotation from my letter of\r\nthat date has already appeared in one of my communications to _Notes and\r\nQueries_. On examining Brande's Chemistry, under the hope of still\r\nfinding the desired solvent which should have a greater affinity for the\r\nsimple silver compound on the uncoloured part of the picture than for\r\nthe portion blackened by light, I happened to see it stated, on Sir John\r\nHerschel's authority, that hyposulphite of soda dissolves chloride of\r\nsilver. I need not now say that I used this fixer with success. The\r\nworld, however, would not have been long without it, for, when Sir John\r\nhimself became a photographer in the following year, he first of all\r\nused hyposulphite of ammonia, and then permanently fell back upon the\r\nproperties of his other compound. Two of my solar microscope negatives,\r\ntaken in 1837, and exhibited with several others by Mr. Brayley in 1839\r\nas illustrations of my letter and of his lecture at the London\r\nInstitution, are now in the possession of the London Photographic\r\nSociety. They are, no doubt, the earliest examples of the agency of two\r\nchemical compounds which will be co-existent with photography itself,\r\nviz., gallate of silver and hyposulphite of soda, and my use of them, as\r\nabove described, will sanction my claim to be the first to take paper\r\npictures rapidly, and to fix them permanently.\r\n\r\n\"Such is a short account of my contribution to this interesting branch\r\nof science, and, in the pleasure of the discovery, I have a sufficient\r\nreward.\"\r\n\r\nThese lengthy extracts from the Rev. Mr. Reade's published letter render\r\nfurther comment all but superfluous, but I cannot resist taking\r\nadvantage of the opportunity here afforded of pointing out to all lovers\r\nof photography and natural justice that the progress of the discovery\r\nhas advanced to a far greater extent by Mr. Reade's reasoning and\r\nexperiments than it was by Mr. Talbot's ingenuity. The latter, as Mr.\r\nReade observes, only \"caught the ball\" and threw it into the Patent\r\nOffice, with some improvements in the manipulations. Mr. Reade\r\ngenerously ascribes all honour and glory to Mr. Talbot for his\r\nshrewdness in seizing what he had overlooked, viz., the development of\r\nthe latent image; but there is a quiet current of rebuke running all\r\nthrough Mr. Reade's letter about the justice of patenting a known\r\nsensitiser and a known accelerator, which he alone had combined and\r\napplied to the successful production of a negative on paper. Mr.\r\nTalbot's patent process was nothing more, yet he endeavoured to secure\r\na monopoly of what was in substance the discovery and invention of\r\nanother. Mr. Talbot was either very precipitate, or ill-advised, to rush\r\nto the Patent Office with his modification, and even at this distant\r\ndate it is much to be regretted that he did so, for his rash act has,\r\nunhappily for photography, proved a pernicious precedent. Mr. Reade gave\r\nhis discoveries to the world freely, and the \"pleasure of the discovery\"\r\nwas \"a sufficient reward.\" All honour to such discoverers. They, and\r\nthey only, are the true lovers of science and art, who take up the torch\r\nwhere another laid it down, or lost it, and carry it forward another\r\nstage towards perfection, without sullying its brightness or dimming the\r\nflame with sordid motives.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. B. Reade lived to see the process _he_ discovered and\r\nwatched over in its embryo state, developed with wondrous rapidity into\r\none of the most extensively applied arts of this marvellous age, and\r\ndied, regretted and esteemed by all who knew him, December 12th, 1870.\r\nPhotographers, your occupations are his monument, but let his name be a\r\ntablet on your hearts, and his unselfishness your emulation!\r\n\r\nThe year 1838 gave birth to another photographic discovery, little\r\nthought of and of small promise at the time, but out of which have\r\nflowed all the various modifications of solar and mechanical carbon\r\nprinting. This was the discovery of Mr. Mungo Ponton, who first observed\r\nand announced the effects of the sun's rays upon bichromate of potash.\r\nBut that gentleman was unwise in his generation, and did not patent his\r\ndiscovery, so a whole host of patent locusts fell upon the field of\r\nresearch in after years, and quickly seized the manna he had left, to\r\nspread on their own bread. Mr. Mungo Ponton spread a solution of\r\nbichromate of potash upon paper, submitted it under a suitable object to\r\nthe sun's rays, and told all the world, without charge, that the light\r\nhardened the bichromate to the extent of its action, and that the\r\nunacted-upon portions could be dissolved away, leaving the object\r\n_white_ upon a yellow or orange ground. Other experimenters played\r\nvariations on Mr. Ponton's bichromate scale, and amongst the performers\r\nwere M. E. Becquerel, of France, and our own distinguished countryman,\r\nMr. Robert Hunt.\r\n\r\nDuring the years that elapsed between the death of M. Niepce and the\r\nperiod to which I have brought these records, little was heard or known\r\nof the researches of M. Daguerre, but he was not idle, nor had he\r\nabandoned his iodine ideas. He steadily pursued his subject, and worked\r\nwith a continuity that gained him the unenviable reputation of a\r\nlunatic. His persistency created doubts of his sanity, but he toiled on\r\n_solus_, confident that he was not in pursuit of an impossibility, and\r\nsanguine of success. That success came, hastened by lucky chance, and\r\nearly in January, 1839, M. Daguerre announced the interesting and\r\nimportant fact that the problem was solved. Pictures in the\r\ncamera-obscura could be, not only seen, but caught and retained. M.\r\nDaguerre had laboured, sought, and found, and the bare announcement of\r\nhis wonderful discovery electrified the world of science.\r\n\r\nThe electric telegraph could not then flash the fascinating intelligence\r\nfrom Paris to London, but the news travelled fast, nevertheless, and the\r\nunexpected report of M. Daguerre's triumph hurried Mr. Talbot forward\r\nwith a similar statement of success. Mr. Talbot declared his triumph on\r\nthe 31st of January, 1839, and published in the following month the\r\ndetails of a process which was little, if any, in advance of that\r\nalready known.\r\n\r\nDaguerre delayed the publication of his process until a pension of six\r\nthousand francs per annum had been secured to himself, and four thousand\r\nfrancs per annum to M. Isidore Niepce for life, with a reversion of\r\none-half to their widows. In the midst of political and social struggles\r\nFrance was proud of the glory of such a marvellous discovery, and\r\nliberally rewarded her fortunate sons of science with honourable\r\ndistinction and substantial emolument. She was proud and generous to a\r\nchivalrous extent, for she pensioned her sons that she might have the\r\n\"glory of endowing the world of science and of art with one of the most\r\nsurprising discoveries\" that had been made on her soil; and, because she\r\nconsidered that \"the invention did not admit of being secured by\r\npatent;\" but avarice and cupidity frustrated her noble and generous\r\nintentions in this country, and England alone was harassed with\r\ninjunctions and prosecutions, while all the rest of the world\r\nparticipated in the pleasure and profits of the noble gift of France.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1839, M. Daguerre divulged his secret at the request and\r\nexpense of the French Government, and the process which bore his name\r\nwas found to be totally different, both in manipulation and effect, from\r\nany sun-pictures that had been obtained in England. The Daguerreotype\r\nwas a latent image produced by light on an iodised silver plate, and\r\ndeveloped, or made visible, by the fumes of mercury; but the resultant\r\npicture was one of the most shimmering and vapoury imaginable, wanting\r\nin solidity, colour, and firmness. In fact, photography as introduced by\r\nM. Daguerre was in every sense a wonderfully shadowy and all but\r\ninvisible thing, and not many removes from the dark ages of its\r\ncreation. The process was extremely delicate and difficult, slow and\r\ntedious to manipulate, and too insensitive to be applied to portraiture\r\nwith any prospect of success, from fifteen to twenty minutes' exposure\r\nin bright sunshine being necessary to obtain a picture. The mode of\r\nproceeding was as follows:--A copper plate with a coating of silver was\r\ncarefully cleaned and polished on the silvered side, that was placed,\r\nsilver side downwards, over a vessel containing iodine in crystals,\r\nuntil the silvered surface assumed a golden-yellow colour. The plate was\r\nthen transferred to the camera-obscura, and submitted to the action of\r\nlight. After the plate had received the requisite amount of exposure, it\r\nwas placed over a box containing mercury, the fumes of which, on the\r\napplication of a gentle heat, developed the latent image. The picture\r\nwas then washed in salt and water, or a solution of hyposulphite of\r\nsoda, to remove the iodide of silver, washed in clean water afterwards,\r\nand dried, and the Daguerreotype was finished according to Daguerre's\r\nfirst published process.\r\n\r\nThe development of the latent image by mercury subliming was the most\r\nmarvellous and unlooked-for part of the process, and it was for that\r\nall-important thing that Daguerre was entirely indebted to chance.\r\nHaving put one of his apparently useless iodized and exposed silver\r\nplates into a cupboard containing a pot of mercury, Daguerre was greatly\r\nsurprised, on visiting the cupboard some time afterwards, to find the\r\nblank looking plate converted into a visible picture. Other plates were\r\niodized and exposed and placed in the cupboard, and the same mysterious\r\nprocess of development was repeated, and it was not until this thing and\r\nthe other thing had been removed and replaced over and over again, that\r\nDaguerre became aware that quicksilver, an article that had been used\r\nfor making mirrors and reflecting images for years, was the developer of\r\nthe invisible image. It was indeed a most marvellous and unexpected\r\nresult. Daguerre had devoted years of labour and made numberless\r\nexperiments to obtain a transcript of nature drawn by her own hand, but\r\nall his studied efforts and weary hours of labour had only resulted in\r\nrepeated failures and disappointments, and it appeared that Nature\r\nherself had grown weary of his bungling, and resolved to show him the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe realization of his hopes was more accidental than inferential. The\r\ncompounds with which he worked, neither produced a visible nor a latent\r\nimage capable of being developed with any of the chemicals with which he\r\nwas experimenting. At last accident rendered him more service than\r\nreasoning, and occult properties produced the effect his mental and\r\ninductive faculties failed to accomplish; and here we observe the great\r\ndifference between the two successful discoverers, Reade and Daguerre.\r\nAt this stage of the discovery I ignore Talbot's claim in _toto_. Reade\r\narrived at his results by reasoning, experiment, observation, and\r\njudiciously weakening and controlling the re-agent he commenced his\r\nresearches with. He had the infinite pleasure and disappointment of\r\nseeing his first picture flash into existence, and disappear again\r\nalmost instantly, but in that instant he saw the cause of his success\r\nand failure, and his inductive reasoning reduced his failure to success;\r\nwhereas Daguerre _found_ his result, was puzzled, and utterly at a loss\r\nto account for it, and it was only by a process of blind-man's bluff in\r\nhis chemical cupboard that he laid his hands on the precious pot of\r\nmercury that produced the visible image.\r\n\r\nThat was a discovery, it is true; but a bungling one, at best. Daguerre\r\nonly worked intelligently with one-half of the elements of success; the\r\nother was thrust in his way, and the most essential part of his\r\nachievement was a triumphant accident. Daguerre did half the work--or,\r\nrather, one-third--light did the second part, and chance performed the\r\nrest, so that Daguerre's share of the honour was only one-third. Reade\r\ndid two-thirds of the process, the first and third, intelligently;\r\ntherefore to him alone is due the honour of discovering practical\r\nphotography. His was a successful application of known properties, equal\r\nto an invention; Daguerre's was an accidental result arising from\r\nunknown causes and effects, and consequently a discovery of the lowest\r\norder. To England, then, and not to France, is the world indebted for\r\nthe discovery of photography, and in the order of its earliest,\r\ngreatest, and most successful discoverers and advancers, I place the\r\nRev. J. B. Reade first and highest.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SECOND PERIOD.\r\n\r\n  DAGUERREOTYPE.\r\n\r\n  L. J. M. DAGUERRE.\r\n  _Used Iodine, 1839._\r\n\r\n  JOHN FREDERICK GODDARD.\r\n  _Applied Bromine, 1840._\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK.\r\n  _Copy of Instantaneous Daguerreotype, 1854._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD.\r\n\r\nPUBLICITY AND PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1839 has generally been accepted as the year of the birth of Practical\r\nPhotography, but that may now be considered an error. It was, however,\r\nthe Year of Publicity, and the progress that followed with such\r\nmarvellous rapidity may be freely received as an adversely eloquent\r\ncomment on the principles of secrecy and restriction, in any art or\r\nscience, like photography, which requires the varied suggestions of\r\nnumerous minds and many years of experiment in different directions\r\nbefore it can be brought to a state of workable certainty and artistic\r\nand commercial applicability. Had Reade concealed his success and the\r\nnature of his accelerator, Talbot might have been bungling on with\r\nmodifications of the experiments of Wedgwood and Davy to this day; and\r\nhad Daguerre not sold the secret of his iodine vapour as a sensitiser,\r\nand his accidentally discovered property of mercury as a developer, he\r\nmight never have got beyond the vapoury images he produced. As it was,\r\nDaguerre did little or nothing to improve his process and make it yield\r\nthe extremely vigorous and beautiful results it did in after years. As\r\nin Mr. Reade's case with the Calotype process, Daguerre threw the ball\r\nand others caught it. Daguerre's advertised improvements of his process\r\nwere lamentable failures and roundabout ways to obtain sensitive\r\namalgams--exceedingly ingenious, but excessively bungling and\r\nimpractical. To make the plates more sensitive to light, and, as\r\nDaguerre said, obtain pictures of objects in motion and animated scenes,\r\nhe suggested that the silver plate should first be cleaned and polished\r\nin the usual way, then to deposit successively layers of mercury, and\r\ngold, and platinum. But the process was so tedious, unworkable, and\r\nunsatisfactory, no one ever attempted to employ it either commercially\r\nor scientifically. In publishing his first process, with its working\r\ndetails, Daguerre appears to have surrendered all that he knew, and to\r\nhave been incapable of carrying his discovery to a higher degree of\r\nadvancement. Without Mr. Goddard's bromine accelerator and M. Fizeau's\r\nchloride of gold fixer and invigorator, the Daguerreotype would never\r\nhave been either a commercial success or a permanent production.\r\n\r\n1840 was almost as important a period in the annals of photography as\r\nthe year of its enunciation, and to the two valuable improvements and\r\none interesting importation, the Daguerreotype process was indebted for\r\nits success all over the world; and photography, even as it is practised\r\nnow, is probably indebted for its present state of advancement to Mr.\r\nJohn Frederick Goddard, who applied bromine, as an accelerator, to the\r\nDaguerreotype process this year. In the early part of the Daguerreotype\r\nperiod it was so insensitive there was very little prospect of being\r\nable to take portraits with it through a lens. To meet this difficulty\r\nMr. Wolcott, an American optician, constructed a reflecting camera and\r\nbrought it to London. It was an ingenious contrivance, but did not fully\r\nanswer the expectations of the inventor. It certainly did not require\r\nsuch a long exposure with this camera as when the rays from the image or\r\nsitter passed through a lens; but, as the sensitised plate was placed\r\n_between_ the sitter and the reflector, the picture was necessarily\r\nsmall, and neither very sharp nor satisfactory. This was a mechanical\r\ncontrivance to shorten the time of exposure, which partially succeeded,\r\nbut it was chemistry, and not mechanics, that effected the desirable\r\nresult. Both Mr. Goddard and M. Antoine F. J. Claudet, of London,\r\nemployed chlorine as a means of increasing the sensitiveness of the\r\niodised silver plate, but it was not sufficiently accelerative to meet\r\nthe requirements of the Daguerreotype process. Subsequently Mr. Goddard\r\ndiscovered that the vapour of bromine, added to that of iodine, imparted\r\nan extraordinary degree of sensitiveness to the prepared plate, and\r\nreduced the time of sitting from minutes to seconds. The addition of the\r\nfumes of bromine to those of iodine formed a compound of bromo-iodide of\r\nsilver on the surface of the Daguerreotype plate, and not only increased\r\nthe sensitiveness, but added to the strength and beauty of the resulting\r\npicture, and M. Fizeau's method of precipitating a film of gold over the\r\nwhole surface of the plate still further increased the brilliancy of the\r\npicture and ensured its permanency. I have many Daguerreotypes in my\r\npossession now that were made over forty years ago, and they are as\r\nbrilliant and perfect as they were on the day they were taken. I fear no\r\none can say the same for any of Fox Talbot's early prints, or even more\r\nrecent examples of silver printing.\r\n\r\nAnother important event of this year was the importation of the first\r\nphotographic lens, camera, &c., into England. These articles were\r\nbrought from Paris by Sir Hussey Vivian, present M.P. for Glamorganshire\r\n(1889). It was the first lot of such articles that the Custom House\r\nofficers had seen, and they were at a loss to know how to classify it.\r\nFinally they passed it under the general head of Optical Instruments.\r\nSir Hussey told me this, himself, several years before he was made a\r\nbaronet. What changes fifty years have wrought even in the duties of\r\nCustom House officers, for the imports and exports of photographic\r\napparatus and materials must now amount to many thousands per annum!\r\n\r\nHaving described the conditions and state of progress photography had\r\nattained at the time of my first contact with it, I think I may now\r\nenter into greater details, and relate my own personal experiences from\r\nthis period right up to the end of its jubilee celebration.\r\n\r\nI was just fourteen years old when photography was made practicable by\r\nthe publication of the two processes, one by Daguerre, and the other by\r\nFox Talbot, and when I heard or read of the wonderful discovery I was\r\nfired with a desire to obtain a sight of these \"sun-pictures,\" but the\r\nfire was kept smouldering for some time before my desire was gratified.\r\nNothing travelled very fast in those days. Railroads had not long been\r\nstarted, and were not very extensively developed. Telegraphy, by\r\nelectricity, was almost unknown, and I was a fixture, having just been\r\napprenticed to an engraving firm hundreds of miles from London. But at\r\nlast I caught sight of one of those marvellous drawings made by the sun\r\nin the window of the Post Office of my native town. It was a small\r\nDaguerreotype which had been sent there along with a notice that a\r\nlicence to practise the \"art\" could be obtained of the patentee. I\r\nforget now what amount the patentee demanded for a licence, but I know\r\nthat at the time referred to it was so far beyond my means and hopes\r\nthat I never entertained the idea of becoming a licencee. I believe some\r\none in the neighbourhood bought a licence, but either could not or did\r\nnot make use of it commercially.\r\n\r\nSome time after that, a Miss Wigley, from London, came to the town to\r\npractise Daguerreotyping, but she did not remain long, and could not, I\r\nthink, have made a profitable visit. If so, it could scarcely be\r\nwondered at, for the sun-pictures of that period were such thin,\r\nshimmering reflections, and distortions of the human face divine, that\r\nvery few people were impressed either by the process or the newest\r\nwonder of the world. At that early period of photography, the plates\r\nwere so insensitive, the sittings so long, and the conditions so\r\nterrible, it was not easy to induce anyone either to undergo the ordeal\r\nof sitting, or to pay the sum of twenty-one shillings for a very small\r\nand unsatisfactory portrait. In the infancy of the Daguerreotype\r\nprocess, the sitters were all placed out-of-doors, in direct sunshine,\r\nwhich naturally made them screw up or shut their eyes, and every feature\r\nglistened, and was painfully revealed. Many amusing stories have been\r\ntold about the trials, mishaps, and disappointments attending those\r\nlong and painful sittings, but the best that ever came to my knowledge\r\nwas the following. In the earliest of the forties, a young lady\r\nwent a considerable distance, in Yorkshire, to sit to an itinerant\r\nDaguerreotypist for her portrait, and, being limited for time,\r\ncould only give one sitting. She was placed before the camera, the\r\nslide drawn, lens uncapped, and requested to sit there until the\r\nDaguerreotypist returned. He went away, probably to put his \"mercury\r\nbox\" in order, or to have a smoke, for it was irksome--both to sitter\r\nand operator--to sit or stand doing nothing during those necessarily\r\nlong exposures. When the operator returned, after an absence of fifteen\r\nor twenty minutes, the lady was sitting where he left her, and appeared\r\nglad to be relieved from her constrained position. She departed, and he\r\nproceeded with the development of the picture. The plate was examined\r\nfrom time to time, in the usual way, but there was no appearance of the\r\nlady. The ground, the wall, and the chair whereon she sat, were all\r\nvisible, but the image of the lady was not; and the operator was\r\ncompletely puzzled, if not alarmed. He left the lady sitting, and found\r\nher sitting when he returned, so he was quite unable to account for her\r\nmysterious non-appearance in the picture. The mystery was, however,\r\nexplained in a few days, when the lady called for her portrait, for she\r\nadmitted that she got up and walked about as soon as he left her, and\r\nonly sat down again when she heard him returning. The necessity of\r\nremaining before the camera was not recognised by that sitter. I\r\nafterwards reversed that result myself by focussing the chair, drawing\r\nthe slide, uncapping the lens, sitting down, and rising leisurely to cap\r\nthe lens again, and obtained a good portrait without showing a ghost of\r\nthe chair or anything else. The foregoing is evidence of the\r\ninsensitiveness of the plates at that early period of the practice of\r\nphotography; but that state of inertion did not continue long, for as\r\nsoon as the accelerating properties of bromine became generally known,\r\nthe time of sitting was greatly reduced, and good Daguerreotype views\r\nwere obtained by simply uncapping the lens as quickly as possible. I\r\nhave taken excellent views in that manner myself in England, and, when\r\nin America, I obtained instantaneous views of Niagara Falls and other\r\nplaces quite as rapidly and as perfect as any instantaneous views made\r\non gelatine dry plates, one of which I have copied and enlarged to 12 by\r\n10 inches, and may possibly reproduce the small copy in these pages.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 I came into direct contact with photography for the first time.\r\nIt was in that year that an Irishman named McGhee came into the\r\nneighbourhood to practise the Daguerreotype process. He was not a\r\nlicencee, but no one appeared to interfere with him, nor serve him with\r\nan injunction, for he carried on his little portrait business for a\r\nconsiderable time without molestation. The patentee was either very\r\nindifferent to his vested interests, or did not consider these intruders\r\nworth going to law with, for there were many raids across the borders by\r\ncamera men in those early days. Several circumstances combined to\r\nfacilitate the inroads of Scotch operators into the northern counties of\r\nEngland. Firstly, the patent laws of England did not extend to Scotland\r\nat that time, so there was a far greater number of Daguerreotypists in\r\nEdinburgh and other Scotch towns in the early days of photography than\r\nin any part of England, and many of them made frequent incursions into\r\nthe forbidden land without troubling themselves about obtaining a\r\nlicence, but somehow they never remained long at a time; they were\r\neither afraid of consequences, or did not meet with patronage\r\nsufficient to induce them to continue their sojourns beyond a few of the\r\nsummer weeks. For many years most of the early Daguerreotypists were\r\nbirds of passage, frequently on the wing. Among the earliest settlers in\r\nLondon, were Mr. Beard (patentee), Mr. Claudet, and Mr. J. E.\r\nMayall--the latter is still alive, 1889--and in Edinburgh, Messrs. Ross\r\nand Thompson, Mr. Howie, Mr. Poppawitz, and Mr. Tunny--the latter was a\r\nCalotypist--with most of whom it was my good fortune to become\r\npersonally acquainted in after years.\r\n\r\nSecondly, a great deal of ill-feeling and annoyance were caused by the\r\nincomprehensible and somewhat underhanded way in which the English\r\npatent was obtained, and these feelings induced many to poach on\r\nphotographic preserves, and even to defy injunctions; and, while\r\nlawsuits were pending, it was not uncommon for non-licencees to practise\r\nthe new art with the impunity and feelings common to smugglers. Mr.\r\nBeard, the English patentee, brought many actions at law against\r\ninfringers of his patent rights, the most memorable of which was that\r\nwhere Mr. Egerton, 1, Temple Street, Whitefriars, the first dealer in\r\nphotographic materials, and agent for Voightlander's lenses in London,\r\nwas the defendant. During that trial it came out in evidence that the\r\npatentee had earned as much as forty thousand pounds in one year by\r\ntaking portraits and fees from licencees. Though the judgment of the\r\nCourt was adverse to Mr. Egerton, it did not improve the patentee's\r\nmoral right to his claim, for the trial only made it all the more public\r\nthat the French Government had allowed M. Daguerre six thousand francs\r\n(L240), and M. Isidore Niepce four thousand francs (L160) per annum, on\r\ncondition that their discoveries should be published, and _made free to\r\nall the world_. This trial did not in any way improve Mr. Beard's\r\nfinancial position, for eventually he became a bankrupt, and his\r\nestablishments in King William Street, London Bridge, and the\r\nPolytechnic Institute, in Regent Street, were extinguished. Mr. Beard,\r\nwho was the first to practise Daguerreotyping commercially in this\r\ncountry, was originally a coal merchant. I think Mr. Claudet practised\r\nthe process in London without becoming a licencee, either through\r\nprevious knowledge, or some private arrangement made with Daguerre\r\nbefore the patent was granted to Mr. Beard. It was while photography was\r\nclouded with this atmosphere of dissatisfaction and litigation, that I\r\nmade my first practical acquaintance with it in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nBeing anxious to obtain possession of one of those marvellous\r\nsun-pictures, and hoping to get an idea of the manner in which they\r\nwere produced, I paid a visit, one sunny morning, to Mr. McGhee, the\r\nDaguerreotypist, dressed in my best, with clean shirt, and stiff\r\nstand-up collar, as worn in those days. I was a very young man then, and\r\nrather particular about the set of my shirt collar, so you may readily\r\njudge of my horror when, after making the financial arrangements to the\r\nsatisfaction of Mr. McGhee, he requested me to put on a blue cotton\r\n_quasi_ clean \"dickey,\" with a limp collar, that had evidently done\r\nsimilar duty many times before. You may be sure I protested, and\r\ninquired the reason why I should cover up my white shirt front with such\r\nan objectionable article. I was told if I did not put it on my shirt\r\nfront would be _solarized_, and come out _blue_ or dirty, whereas if I\r\nput on the blue \"dickey\" my shirt front would appear white and clean.\r\nWhat \"solarized\" meant, I did not know, nor was it further explained,\r\nbut, as I very naturally wished to appear with a clean shirt front, I\r\nsubmitted to the indignity, and put on the limp and questionably clean\r\n\"dickey.\" While the Daguerreotypist was engaged with some mysterious\r\nmanipulations in a cupboard or closet, I brushed my hair, and\r\ncontemplated my singular appearance in the mirror somewhat ruefully. O,\r\nye sitters and operators of to-day! congratulate yourselves on the\r\nchanges and advantages that have been wrought in the practice of\r\nphotography since then. When Mr. McGhee appeared again with something\r\nlike two wooden books in his hand, he requested me to follow him into\r\nthe garden; which was only a back yard. At the foot of the garden, and\r\nagainst a brick wall with a piece of grey cloth nailed over it, I was\r\nrequested to sit down on an old chair; then he placed before me an\r\ninstrument which looked like a very ugly theodolite on a tripod\r\nstand--that was my first sight of a camera--and, after putting his head\r\nunder a black cloth, told me to look at a mark on the other side of the\r\ngarden, without winking or moving till he said \"done.\" How long I sat I\r\ndon't know, but it seemed an awfully long time, and I have no doubt it\r\nwas, for I know that I used to ask people to sit five and ten minutes,\r\nafterwards. The sittings over, I was requested to re-enter the house,\r\nand then I thought I would see something of the process; but no. Again\r\nMr. McGhee went into the mysterious chamber, and shut the door quickly.\r\nIn a little time he returned and told me that the sittings were\r\nsatisfactory--he had taken two--and that he would finish and deliver\r\nthem next day. Then I left without obtaining the ghost of an idea of the\r\n_modus operandi_ of producing portraits by the sun, beyond the fact that\r\na camera had been placed before me. Next day the portraits were\r\ndelivered according to promise, but I confess I was somewhat\r\ndisappointed at getting so little for my money. It was a very small\r\npicture that could not be seen in every light, and not particularly like\r\nmyself, but a scowling-looking individual, with a limp collar, and\r\nrather dirty-looking face. Whatever would _mashers_ have said or done,\r\nif they had gone to be photographed in those days of photographic\r\ndarkness? I was, however, somewhat consoled by the thought that I, at\r\nlast, possessed one of those wonderful sun-pictures, though I was\r\nignorant of the means of production.\r\n\r\nSoon after having my portrait taken, Mr. McGhee disappeared, and there\r\nwas no one left in the neighbourhood who knew anything of the\r\nmysterious manipulations of Daguerreotyping. I had, nevertheless,\r\nresolved to possess an apparatus and obtain the necessary information,\r\nbut there was no one to tell me what to buy, where to buy it, nor what\r\nto do with it. At last an old friend of mine who had been on a visit to\r\nEdinburgh, had purchased an apparatus and some materials with the view\r\nof taking Daguerreotypes himself, but finding that he could not, was\r\nwilling to sell it to me, though he could not tell me how to use it,\r\nbeyond showing me an image of the house opposite upon the ground glass\r\nof the camera. I believe my friend let me have the apparatus for what it\r\ncost him, which was about L15, and it consisted of a quarter-plate\r\nportrait lens by Slater, mahogany camera, tripod stand, buff sticks,\r\ncoating and mercury boxes of the roughest description, a few chemicals\r\nand silvered plates, and a rather singular but portable dark room. Of\r\nthe uses of the chemicals I knew very little, and of their nature\r\nnothing which led to very serious consequences, which I shall relate in\r\nthe proper place. Having obtained possession of this marvellous\r\napparatus, my next ardent aspiration was to make a successful use of it.\r\nI distinctly remember, even at this distant date, with what nervous\r\ncuriosity I examined all the articles when I unpacked them in my\r\nfather's house, and with what wonder, not unmixed with apprehension, my\r\nfather looked upon that display of unknown, and to him apparently\r\nnameless and useless toys. \"More like a lot of conjuror's traps than\r\nanything else,\" he exclaimed, after I had set them all out. And a few\r\ndays after he told one of my young friends that he thought I had gone\r\nout of my mind to take up with that \"Daggertype\" business; the name\r\nitself was a stumbling block in those days, for people called the\r\nprocess \"dagtype, docktype, and daggertype\" more frequently than by its\r\nproper name, Daguerreotype. What a contrast now-a-days, when almost\r\nevery father is an amateur photographer, and encourages both his sons\r\nand daughters to become the same. My father was a very good parent, in\r\nhis way, and encouraged me, to the fullest extent of his means, in the\r\nstudy of music and painting, and even sent me to the Government School\r\nof Design, where I studied drawing under W. B. Scott; but the\r\nnew-fangled method of taking portraits did not harmonise with his\r\nconservative and practical notions. One cause of his disapprobation and\r\ndissatisfaction was, doubtless, my many failures; in fact, I may say,\r\ninability to show him any result. I had acquired an apparatus of the\r\nroughest and most primitive construction, but no knowledge of its use or\r\nthe behaviour of the chemicals employed, beyond the bare numerical order\r\nin which they were to be used, and there was no one within a hundred\r\nmiles of where I lived, that I knew of, who could give me lessons or the\r\nslightest hint respecting the process. I had worn out the patience of\r\nall my relations and friends in fruitless sittings. I had set fire to my\r\nsingular dark room, and nearly set fire to the house, by attempting to\r\nrefill the spirit lamp while alight, and I was ill and suffering from\r\nsalivation through inhaling the fumes of mercury in my blind, anxious,\r\nand enthusiastic endeavours to obtain a sun-picture. It is not long\r\nsince an eminent photographer told me that I was an enthusiast, but if\r\nhe had seen me in those days he would, in all probability, have told me\r\nthat I was mad. Though ill, I was not mad; I was only determined not to\r\nbe beaten. I was resolved to keep pegging away until I obtained a\r\nsatisfactory result. My friends laughed at me when I asked them to sit\r\nfor a trial, and they either refused, or sat with a very bad grace, as\r\nif it really were a trial to them; but fancy, fair and kindly readers,\r\nwhat it must have been to me! Finding that my living models fought shy\r\nof me and my trials, I then thought of getting a lay figure, and\r\nborrowed a large doll--quite as big as a baby--of one of my lady\r\nfriends. I stuck it up in a garden and pegged away at it for nearly six\r\nmonths. At the end of that time I was able to produce a portrait of the\r\ndoll with tolerable certainty and success. Then I ventured to ask my\r\nfriends to sit again, but my process was too slow for life studies, and\r\nmy live sitters generally moved so much, their portraits were not\r\nrecognisable. There were no head-rests in those days, at least I did not\r\npossess one, or it might have been pleasanter for my sitters and easier\r\nfor myself. What surprised me very much--and I thought it a singular\r\nthing at the time--was my success in copying an engraving of Thorburn's\r\nMiniature of the Queen. I made several good and beautiful copies of that\r\nengraving, and sent one to an artist friend, then in Devonshire, who\r\nwrote to say that it was beautiful, and that if he could get a\r\nDaguerreotype portrait with the eyes as clear as that, he would sit at\r\nonce; but all the \"Dagtypes\" he had hitherto seen had only black holes\r\nwhere the eyes should be. Unfortunately, that was my own experience. I\r\ncould copy from the flat well enough, but when I went to the round I\r\nwent wrong. Ultimately I discovered the cause of all that, and found a\r\nremedy, but oh! the weary labour and mental worry I underwent before I\r\nmastered the difficulties of the most troublesome and uncertain, yet\r\nmost beautiful and permanent of all the photographic processes that ever\r\nwas discovered or invented; and now it is a lost art. No one practises\r\nit, and I don't think that there are half-a-dozen men living--myself\r\nincluded--that could at this day go through all the manipulations\r\nnecessary to produce a good Daguerreotype portrait or picture; yet, when\r\nthe process was at the height of its popularity, a great number of\r\npeople pursued it as a profession in all parts of the civilized world,\r\nand in the United States of America alone it was estimated in 1854 that\r\nthere were not less than thirty thousand people making their living as\r\nDaguerreans. Few, if any, of the photographers of to-day--whether\r\namateur or professional--know anything of the forms or uses of plates,\r\nbuffs, lathes, sensitising or developing boxes, gilding stands, or other\r\nDaguerreotype appliances; and I am quite certain that there is not a\r\ndealer in all England that can furnish at this date a complete set of\r\nDaguerreotype apparatus.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1849 that I gilded my first picture--a portrait of one of my\r\nfriends playing a guitar. I possess that picture now, and, after a lapse\r\nof forty years, it is as good and bright as it was on the day that it\r\nwas taken. It was not a first-class production, but I hoped to do better\r\nsoon, and on the strength of that hope determined to commence business\r\nas a professional Daguerreotypist. While I was considering whether I\r\nshould pitch my tent permanently in my native town, or take to a nomadic\r\nkind of life, similar to what other Daguerreotypists were pursuing, I\r\nwas helped to a decision by the sudden appearance of a respectable and\r\nexperienced Daguerreotypist who came and built a \"glass house\"--the\r\nfirst of its kind--in my native town. This somewhat disarranged my\r\nplans, but on the whole it was rather opportune and advantageous than\r\notherwise, for it afforded me an unexpected opportunity of gaining a\r\ngreat deal of practical experience on easy terms. The new comer was Mr.\r\nGeorge Brown, who had been an \"operator\" for Mr. Beard, in London, and\r\nas he exhibited much finer specimens of the Daguerreotype process than\r\nany I had hitherto seen, I engaged myself to assist him for six months\r\nat a small salary. I showed him what I had done, and he showed and told\r\nme all that he knew in connection with photography, and thus commenced a\r\nbusiness relation that ripened into a friendship that endured as long as\r\nhe lived.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the six months' engagement I left Mr. Brown, to commence\r\nbusiness on my own account, but as neither of us considered that there\r\nwas room for two Daguerreotypists in a town with a population of _one\r\nhundred and twenty thousand_, I was driven to adopt the nomadic mode of\r\nlife peculiar to the itinerant photographer of the period. That was in\r\n1850. Up to that time I had done nothing in Calotype work. Mr. Brown was\r\nstrictly a Daguerreotypist, but Mr. Parry, at that time a glass dealer\r\nand amateur photographer, was working at the Calotype process, but not\r\nvery successfully, for nearly all his efforts were spoiled by\r\ndecomposition, which he could not then account for or overcome, but he\r\neventually became one of the best Calotypists in the neighbourhood, and\r\nI became the possessor of some of the finest Calotype negatives he ever\r\nproduced, many of which are still in my possession. Mr. Parry\r\nrelinquished his glass business, and became a professional photographer\r\nsoon after the introduction of the collodion process. Another amateur\r\nphotographer that I met in those early days was a flute player in the\r\norchestra of the theatre. He produced very good Calotype negatives with\r\na single lens, and was very enthusiastic, but extremely reticent on all\r\nphotographic matters. About this period I made the acquaintance of Mr.\r\nJ. W. Swan: I had known him for some time previously when he was\r\napprentice and assistant to Mr. Mawson, chemist, in Mosley Street,\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne. Neither Mr. Mawson nor Mr. Swan were known to the\r\nphotographic world at that time. Mr. Mawson was most popular as a dealer\r\nin German yeast, and I think it was not until after Archer published his\r\nprocess that they began to make collodion and deal in photographic\r\nmaterials--at any rate, I did not buy any photographic goods of them\r\nuntil 1852, when I first began to use Mawson's collodion. In October,\r\n1850, I went to Hexham, about twenty miles west of Newcastle-on-Tyne, to\r\nmake my first appearance as a professional Daguerreotypist. I rented a\r\nsitting-room with a good window and clear view, so as to take \"parlour\r\nportraits.\" I could only take small pictures--two and a half by two\r\ninches--for which I charged half a guinea, and was favoured with a few\r\nsittings; but it was a slow place, and I left it in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThe next move I made was to Seaham Harbour, and there I did a little\r\nbetter business, but the place was too small and the people too poor for\r\nme to continue long. Half guineas were not plentiful, even among the\r\ntradespeople, and there were very few gentlefolk in the neighbourhood.\r\nSome of the townspeople were very kind to me, and invited me to their\r\nhomes, and although my sojourn was not very profitable, it was very\r\npleasant. I had many pleasant rambles on the sands, and often looked at\r\nSeaham Hall and thought of Byron and his matrimonial disappointment in\r\nhis marriage with Miss Milbank.\r\n\r\nFrom Seaham Harbour I went to Middlesborough, hoping to do more business\r\namong a larger population, but it appeared as if I were only going from\r\nbad to worse. At that date the population was about thirty thousand, but\r\nchiefly people of the working classes, employed at Balchow and Vaughn's\r\nand kindred works. I made portraits of some of the members of Mr.\r\nBalchow's family, Mr. Geordison, and some of the resident Quakers, but\r\naltogether I did not do much more than pay expenses. I managed, however,\r\nto stay there till the year 1851, when I caught the World's Fair fever,\r\nso I packed up my apparatus and other things I did not require\r\nimmediately, and sent them to my father's house, and with a few changes\r\nin my carpet-bag, and a little money in my pocket, I started off to see\r\nthe Great Exhibition in London. I went by way of York and Hull, with the\r\ntwo-fold object of seeing some friends in both places, and to prospect\r\non the business chances they might afford. At York I found Mr. Pumphrey\r\nwas located, but as he did not appear to be fully occupied with\r\nsitters--for I found him trying to take a couple of boys fighting in a\r\nback yard--I thought there was not room for another Daguerreotypist in\r\nYork. In a few days I went to Hull, but even there the ground was\r\npreoccupied, so I took the first steamer for London. We sailed on a\r\nSaturday night, and after a pleasant voyage arrived at the wharf below\r\nLondon Bridge early on Sunday evening. I put up at the \"Yorkshire Grey,\"\r\nin Thames Street, where I met several people from the North, also on a\r\nvisit to London to see the Great Exhibition. This being my first visit\r\nto London, I was anxious to get a sight of the streets and crowds\r\ntherein, so, after obtaining some refreshment, I strolled out with one\r\nof my fellow passengers to receive my first impressions of the great\r\nmetropolis. The evening was fine, and, being nearly the longest day,\r\nthere was light enough to enable me to see the God-forsaken appearance\r\nof Thames Street, the dismal aspect of Fish Street Hill, and the gloomy\r\ncolumn called \"The Monument\" that stands there to remind citizens and\r\nstrangers of the Great Fire of 1666; but I was both amazed and amused\r\nwith the life and bustle I saw on London Bridge and other places in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, but my eyes and ears soon became fatigued with\r\nthe sights and sounds of the lively and noisy thoroughfares. After a\r\nnight's rest, which was frequently broken by cries of \"Stop thief!\" and\r\nthe screams of women, I arose and made an early start for the Great\r\nExhibition of 1851. Of all the wonderful things in that most wonderful\r\nexhibition, I was most interested in the photographic exhibits and the\r\nbeautiful specimens of American Daguerreotypes, both portraits and\r\nlandscapes, especially the views of Niagara Falls, which made me\r\ndetermine to visit America as soon as ever I could make the necessary\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nWhile examining and admiring those very beautiful Daguerreotypes, I\r\nlittle thought that I was standing, as it were, between the birth of one\r\nprocess and the death of another; but so it was, for the newly-born\r\ncollodion process very soon annihilated the Daguerreotype, although the\r\nlatter process had just reached the zenith of its beauty. In the March\r\nnumber of the _Chemist_, Archer's Collodion Process was published, and\r\nthat was like the announcement of the birth of an infant Hercules, that\r\nwas destined to slay a beautiful youth whose charms had only arrived at\r\nmaturity. But there was really a singular and melancholy coincidence in\r\nthe birth of the Collodion Process and the early death of the\r\nDaguerreotype, for Daguerre himself died on July 10th, 1851, so that\r\nboth Daguerre and his process appeared to receive their death blows in\r\nthe same year. I don't suppose that Daguerre died from a shock to his\r\nsystem, caused by the publication of a rival process, for it is not\r\nlikely that he knew anything about the invention of a process that was\r\ndestined, in a very few years, to abolish his own--living as he was in\r\nthe retirement of his native village, and enjoying his well-earned\r\npension.\r\n\r\nAs Daguerre was the first of the successful discoverers of photography\r\nto be summoned by death, I will here give a brief sketch of his life and\r\npursuits prior to his association with Nicephore Niepce and photography.\r\nLouis Jacques Mande Daguerre was born at Cormeilles, near Paris, in\r\n1787, of poor and somewhat careless parents, who appear to have bestowed\r\nupon him more names than attention. Though they did not endow him with a\r\ngood education, they had the good sense to observe the bent of his mind\r\nand apprentice him to a theatrical scene painter. In that situation he\r\nsoon made his mark, and his artistic and mechanical abilities, combined\r\nwith industry, painstaking, and boldness of conception, soon raised him\r\nto the front rank of his profession, in which he gained both honour and\r\nprofit. Like all true artists, he was fond of sketching from nature;\r\nand, to save time and secure true proportion, he employed such optical\r\nappliances as were then at his command. Some of his biographers say\r\nthat he, like Fox Talbot, employed the camera lucida; others the\r\ncamera-obscura; as there is a considerable difference between the two\r\nit would be interesting to know which it really was. At any rate it was\r\none of these instruments which gave him the notion and created the desire\r\nto secure the views as they were presented by the lens or reflector. Much\r\nof his time was devoted to the painting and construction of a diorama\r\nwhich was first exhibited in 1822, and created quite a sensation in\r\nParis. As early as 1824 he commenced his photographic experiments, with\r\nvery little knowledge on the subject; but with the hope and\r\ndetermination of succeeding, by some means or other, in securing the\r\npictures as Nature painted them on the screen or receiver. Doubtless he\r\nwas sanguine enough then to hope to be able to obtain colours as well as\r\ndrawings, but he died without seeing that accomplished, and so will many\r\nothers. What he did succeed in accomplishing was marvellous, and quite\r\nentitled him to all the honour and emolument he received, but he only\r\nlived about twelve years after his discovery. He was, however, saved the\r\nmortification of seeing his beautiful discovery discarded and cast away\r\nin the hey-day of its beauty and perfection.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks sojourn in London, seeing all the sights and\r\nrevisiting all the Daguerreotype studios, I turned my back on the great\r\ncity and my footsteps homewards again. As soon as I reached home I\r\nunpacked my apparatus and made arrangements for another campaign with\r\nthe camera at some of the sea-side resorts, with the hope of making up\r\nfor lost time and money through visiting London.\r\n\r\nI had looked at Scarborough and found the Brothers Holroyd located\r\nthere; at Whitby, Mr. Stonehouse; and I did not like the appearance of\r\nRedcar, so I settled upon Tynemouth, and did fairly well for a short\r\nseason. About the end of October I went on to Carlisle, but a Scotchman\r\nhad already preceded me there, and I thought one Daguerreotypist was\r\nquite enough for so small a place, and pushed on to Penrith, where I\r\nsettled for the winter and gradually worked up a little connection, and\r\nformed some life-long friendships. I was the first Daguerreotypist who\r\nhad visited the town of Penrith, and while there I made Daguerreotypes\r\nof Sir George and Lady Musgrave and family, and some members of the\r\nLonsdale family. It was through the kindness of Miss Lowther that I was\r\ninduced to go to Whitehaven, but I did not do much business there, so,\r\nafter a bad winter, I resolved to go to America in the spring, and made\r\narrangements for the voyage immediately. Thinking that I would find\r\nbetter apparatus and appliances in America, I disposed of my \"Tent and\r\nKit,\" closed up my affairs, bid adieu to my relatives and friends, and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the benefit and experience of a long sea voyage, I secured a\r\ncabin passage in a sailing ship named the _Amazon_, and sailed from\r\nShields towards the end of April, 1853. We crossed the Tyne bar late in\r\nthe evening with a fair wind, and sailed away for the Pentland Frith so\r\nas to gain the Atlantic by sailing all round the North of Scotland. I\r\nwas rather upset the first night, but recovered my appetite next\r\nmorning. We entered the Pentland Frith on the Saturday afternoon, and\r\nwere running through the Channel splendidly, when the carpenter came to\r\nreport water in the well--I forget how many feet--but he thought it\r\nwould not be safe to attempt crossing the Atlantic. I was a little\r\nalarmed at this, but the captain took it very coolly, and ordered the\r\nship to be pumped every watch. Being the only passenger, I became a kind\r\nof chum and companion to the captain, and as we sat over our grog that\r\nnight in the cabin our conversation naturally turned upon the condition\r\nof the ship, when he remarked that he was disappointed, and that he\r\n\"expected he had got a sound ship under his feet this time.\" These words\r\ndid not make much impression upon me then, but I had reason to\r\ncomprehend their meaning afterwards. I was awoke early on the Sunday\r\nmorning by the noise caused by the working of the pumps, and on going on\r\ndeck found that we were becalmed, lying off the coast of Caithnesshire,\r\nand the water pouring out of the pump-hole in a continuous stream. After\r\nbreakfast, and while sitting on the taffrail of the quarterdeck along\r\nwith the captain, waiting for a breeze, I asked him if he intended to\r\ncross the Atlantic in such a leaky vessel. He answered \"Yes, and the men\r\nare all willing.\" So I thought if these men were not afraid of the ship\r\nfoundering, I need not be; but I had reasons afterwards for coming to an\r\nopposite conclusion.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the breeze sprang up briskly, and away we went, the\r\nship heading W.N.W., as the captain said he wanted to make the northern\r\npassage. Next morning we were in a rather rough sea, and a gale of wind\r\nblowing. One of the yards was broken with the force of the wind, and the\r\nsail and broken yard dangled about the rigging for a considerable time\r\nbefore the sail could be hauled in and the wreckage cleared up. We had\r\nseveral days of bad weather, and one morning when I got up I found the\r\nship heading East. I naturally concluded that we were returning, but the\r\ncaptain said that he had only turned the ship about to enable the men to\r\nstop a leak in her bows. The carpenter afterwards told me that the water\r\ncame in there like a river during the night. Thus we went on through\r\nvariable weather until at last we sighted two huge icebergs, and then\r\nNewfoundland, when the captain informed me that he intended now to coast\r\nup to New York. We got out of sight of land occasionally, and one day,\r\nafter the captain had taken his observations and worked out the ship's\r\nposition, he called my attention to the chart, and observed that he\r\nintended to sail between an island and the mainland, but as the Channel\r\nwas subject to strong and variable currents, it was a rather dangerous\r\nexperiment. Being in such a leaky ship, I thought he wanted to hug the\r\nland as much as possible, which I considered a very wise and safe\r\nproceeding; but he had ulterior objects in view, which the sequel will\r\nreveal.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 31st of May, after a long yarn from the captain\r\nabout how he was once wrecked on an iceberg, I turned in with a feeling\r\nof perfect safety, for the sea was calm, the night clear, and the wind\r\nfair and free; but about daylight next morning I was awoke with a shock,\r\na sudden tramping on deck, and the mate shouting down the companion\r\nstairs, \"Captain, the ship's ashore.\" Both the captain and I rushed on\r\ndeck just as we jumped out of our berths, but we could not see anything\r\nof the land or shore, for we were enveloped in a thick fog. We heard the\r\nbreakers and felt the thud of the waves as they broke upon the ship,\r\nbut whether we had struck on a rock or grounded on a sandy beach we\r\ncould not then ascertain. The captain ordered the sails to be \"slewed\r\nback\" and a hawser to be thrown astern, but all efforts to get the ship\r\noff were in vain, for with every wave the ship forged more and more on\r\nto the shore.\r\n\r\nAs the morning advanced, the fog cleared away a little, which enabled us\r\nto see dimly through the mist the top of a bank of yellow sand. This\r\nsight settled the doubt as to our whereabouts, and the captain\r\nimmediately gave the order \"Prepare to abandon the ship.\" The long boat\r\nwas at once got ready, and lowered with considerable difficulty, for the\r\nship was then more among the breakers. After a good deal of delay and\r\ndanger, we all succeeded in leaving the ship and clearing the breakers.\r\nWe were exposed in the open boats all that day and night, and about ten\r\no'clock next morning we effected a landing on the lee side of the\r\nisland, which we ascertained to be Sable Island, a bald crown of one of\r\nthe banks of Newfoundland. Here we received help, shelter, and\r\nprovisions, all provided by the Home and Colonial Governments, for the\r\nrelief of shipwrecked people, for this island was one of the places\r\nwhere ships were both accidentally and wilfully wrecked. We were obliged\r\nto stay there sixteen days before we could get a vessel to take us to\r\nHalifax, Nova Scotia, the nearest port, and would possibly have had to\r\nremain on the island much longer, but for a mutiny among the crew. I\r\ncould describe some strange and startling incidents in connection with\r\nthe wreck and mutiny, but I will not allow myself to be tempted further\r\ninto the vale of divergence, as the chief object I have in view is my\r\nreminiscence of photography.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Sable Island I was taken to Halifax, where I waited the\r\narrival of the Cunard steamer _Niagara_, to take me on to Boston; thence\r\nI proceeded by rail and steamer to New York, where I arrived about the\r\nend of June, 1853.\r\n\r\nOn landing in New York I only knew one individual, and not knowing how\r\nfar I should have to go to find him I put up at an hotel on Broadway,\r\nbut soon found that too expensive for my means, and went to a private\r\nboarding house as soon as I could.\r\n\r\nVisiting all the leading Daguerreotypists on Broadway, I was somewhat\r\nastonished at their splendid reception rooms, and the vast number of\r\nlarge and excellent specimens exhibited. Their plain Daguerreotypes were\r\nall of fine quality, and free from the \"buff lines\" so noticeable in\r\nEnglish work at that period; but all their attempts at colouring were\r\nmiserable failures, and when I showed one of my coloured specimens to\r\nMr. Gurney, he said, \"Well, if you can colour one of my pictures like\r\nthat I'll believe you;\" which I soon did, and very much to his\r\nastonishment. In those days I prepared my own colours, and Mr. Gurney\r\nbought a box immediately. The principal Daguerreotypists in New York at\r\nthat time were Messrs. Brady, Gurney, Kent, Lawrence, Mead Brothers, and\r\nSamuel Root, and I called upon them all before I entered into any\r\nbusiness arrangements, finally engaging myself to Messrs. Mead Brothers\r\nas a colourist and teacher of colouring for six months, and while\r\nfulfilling that engagement I gave lessons to several \"Daguerreans,\" and\r\nmade the acquaintance of men from all parts of the Union, for I soon\r\nobtained some notoriety throughout the States in consequence of a man\r\nnamed Humphrey attacking me and my colouring process in a photographic\r\njournal which bore his name, as well as in the _New York Tribune_. I\r\nreplied to his attack in the columns of the _Tribune_, but I saw that he\r\nhad a friend on the staff, and I did not feel inclined to continue the\r\ncontroversy. Mr. Humphrey knew nothing about my process, but began and\r\ncontinued the discussion on his knowledge of what was known as the\r\n\"Isinglass Process,\" which was not mine. After completing my engagements\r\nwith Messrs. Mead Brothers, I made arrangements to supply the stock\r\ndealers with my prepared colours, and travel the States myself to\r\nintroduce them to all the Daguerreans residing in the towns and cities I\r\nshould visit.\r\n\r\nIn the principal cities I found all the Daguerreans quite equal to the\r\nbest in New York, and all doing good business, and I gave lessons in\r\ncolouring to most of them. In Newark I met Messrs. Benjamin and Polson;\r\nin Philadelphia, Marcus Root and Dr. Bushnell. I encountered a great many\r\n_doctors_ and _professors_ in the business in America. In Baltimore,\r\nMaryland--then a slave State--many of the Daguerreans owned slaves. In\r\nWashington D.C., I renewed my acquaintance with Mr. George Adams, one of\r\nthe best Daguerreans in the City; and while visiting him a very curious\r\nthing occurred. One of the representatives of the South came in to have\r\nhis portrait taken, and the first thing he did was to lay a revolver and\r\na bowie knife on the table beside him. He had just come from the House\r\nof Representatives. His excuse for such a proceeding was that he had\r\nbought some slaves at the market at Alexandria, and was going to take\r\nthem home that night. He was a very tall man, and when he stood up\r\nagainst the background his head was above it. As he wanted to be taken\r\nstanding, this put Mr. Adams into a dilemma, and he asked what he should\r\ndo. I thought the only thing that could be done was to move the\r\nbackground up and down during exposure, which we did, and so obviated\r\nthe appearance of a line crossing the head.\r\n\r\nWhile staying in Washington I attended one of the levees at the White\r\nHouse, and was introduced to President Pearce. There was no fuss or\r\ndifficulty in gaining admission. I had only to present my card at the\r\ndoor, and the City Marshall at once led me into the room where the\r\nPresident, surrounded by some of his Cabinet, was waiting to receive,\r\nand I was introduced. After a cordial shake of his hand, I passed on to\r\nanother saloon where there was music and promenading in mixed costumes,\r\nfor most of the men were dressed as they liked, and some of the ladies\r\nwore bonnets. It was the weekly _sans ceremonie_ reception. Finding many\r\nof the people of Washington very agreeable and hospitable, I stayed\r\nthere a considerable time. When I started on the southern journey I did\r\nintend to go on to New Orleans, but I stayed so long in Philadelphia and\r\nWashington the summer was too far advanced, and as a rather severe\r\noutbreak of yellow fever had occurred, I returned to New York and took a\r\njourney northward, visiting Niagara Falls, and going on to Canada. I\r\nsailed up the Hudson River, stopping at Albany and Troy. At the latter\r\nplace I met an Englishman, named Irvine, a Daguerrean who treated me\r\nhospitably, and for whom I coloured several Daguerreotypes. He wanted me\r\nto stay with him, but that I declined. Thence I proceeded to Rochester,\r\nand there found that one of my New York pupils had been before me,\r\nrepresenting himself as Werge the colourist, for when I introduced\r\nmyself to the principal Daguerrean he told me that Werge--a very\r\ndifferent man--had been there two or three weeks ago. I discovered who\r\nthe fellow was, and that he had practised a piece of Yankee smartness\r\nfor which I had no redress. From Rochester I proceeded to Buffalo, where\r\nI met with another instance of Yankee smartness of a different kind. I\r\nhad sold some colours to a man there who paid me in dollar bills, the\r\nusual currency of the country, but when I tendered one of these bills\r\nfor payment at the hotel, it was refused. I next offered it on board a\r\nsteamboat, but there it was also declined. When I had an opportunity I\r\nreturned it to the man who gave it to me, and requested him to send me a\r\ngood one instead. He was honest enough to do that, and impudent enough\r\nto tell me that he knew it was bad when he gave it to me, but as I was a\r\nstranger he thought I might pass it off easily.\r\n\r\nI next went to Niagara Falls, where it was my good fortune to encounter\r\ntwo very different specimens of American character in the persons of Mr.\r\nEasterly and Mr. Babbitt, the former a visitor and the latter a resident\r\nDaguerrean, who held a monopoly from General Porter to Daguerreotype\r\nthe Falls and visitors. He had a pavilion on the American side of the\r\nFalls, under which his camera was in position all day long, and when a\r\ngroup of visitors stood on the shore to survey the Falls from that\r\npoint, he took the group--without their knowledge--and showed it to the\r\nvisitors before they left. In almost every instance he sold the picture\r\nat a good price; the people were generally delighted to be taken at the\r\nFalls. I need hardly say that they were all taken instantaneously, and\r\nembraced a good general view, including the American Fall, Goat Island,\r\nthe Horse Shoe Fall, and the Canadian shore. Many of these views I\r\ncoloured for Mr. Babbitt, but there was always a beautiful green colour\r\non the brink of the Horse Shoe Fall which I never could match. For many\r\nyears I possessed one of Mr. Babbitt's Daguerreotype views, as well as\r\nothers taken by Mr. Easterly and myself, but I had the misfortune to be\r\ndeprived of them all by fire. Some years after I lent them to an\r\nexhibition in Glasgow, which was burnt down, and all the exhibits\r\ndestroyed. After a delightful sojourn of three weeks at Niagara Falls, I\r\ntook steamer on the lower Niagara River, sailed down to Lake Ontario,\r\nand down the River St. Lawrence, shooting the Lachine Rapids, and on to\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nIn the Canadian City I did not find business very lively, so after\r\nviewing the fine Cathedral of Notre Dame, the mountain, and other\r\nplaces, I left Montreal and proceeded by rail to Boston. The difference\r\nbetween the two cities was immense. Montreal was dull and sleepy, Boston\r\nwas all bustle and life, and the people were as unlike as the cities. On\r\nmy arrival in Boston, I put up at the Quincy Adams Hotel, and spent the\r\nfirst few days in looking about the somewhat quaint and interesting old\r\ncity, hunting up Franklin Associations, and revolutionary landmarks,\r\nBunker Hill, and other places of interest. Having satisfied my appetite\r\nfor these things, I began to look about me with an eye to business, and\r\ncalled upon the chief Daguerreans and photographers in Boston. Messrs.\r\nSouthworth and Hawes possessed the largest Daguerreotype establishment,\r\nand did an excellent business. In their \"Saloon\" I saw the largest and\r\nfinest revolving stereoscope that was ever exhibited. The pictures were\r\nall whole-plate Daguerreotypes, and set vertically on the perpendicular\r\ndrum on which they revolved. The drum was turned by a handle attached to\r\ncog wheels, so that a person sitting before it could see the\r\nstereoscopic pictures with the utmost ease. It was an expensive\r\ninstrument, but it was a splendid advertisement, for it drew crowds to\r\ntheir saloon to see it and to sit, and their enterprise met with its\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Whipple's gallery, in Washington Street, a dual photography was\r\ncarried on, for he made both Daguerreotypes and what he called\r\n\"crystallotypes,\" which were simply plain silver prints obtained from\r\ncollodion negatives. Mr. Whipple was the first American photographer who\r\nsaw the great commercial advantages of the collodion process over the\r\nDaguerreotype, and he grafted it on the elder branch of photography\r\nalmost as soon as it was introduced. Indeed, Mr. Whipple's establishment\r\nmay be considered the very cradle of American photography as far as\r\ncollodion negatives and silver prints are concerned, for he was the very\r\nfirst to take hold of it with spirit, and as early as 1853 he was doing\r\na large business in photographs, and teaching the art to others.\r\nAlthough I had taken collodion negatives in England with Mawson's\r\ncollodion in 1852, I paid Mr. Whipple fifty dollars to be shown how he\r\nmade his collodion, silver bath, developer, printing, &c., &c., for\r\nwhich purpose he handed me over to his active and intelligent assistant\r\nand newly-made partner, Mr. Black. This gave me the run of the\r\nestablishment, and I was somewhat surprised to find how vast and varied\r\nwere his mechanical appliances for reducing labour and expediting work.\r\nThe successful practice of the Daguerreotype art greatly depended on the\r\ncleanness and highly polished surface of the silvered plates, and to\r\nsecure these necessary conditions, Mr. Whipple had, with characteristic\r\nand Yankee-like ingenuity, obtained the assistance of a steam engine\r\nwhich not only \"drove\" all the circular cleaning and buffing wheels, but\r\nan immense circular fan which kept the studio and sitters delightfully\r\ncool. Machinery and ingenuity did a great many things in Mr. Whipple's\r\nestablishment in the early days of photography. Long before the\r\nAmbrotype days, pictures were taken on glass and thrown upon canvas by\r\nmeans of the oxyhydrogen light for the use of artists. At that early\r\nperiod of the history of photography, Messrs. Whipple and Black did an\r\nimmense \"printing and publishing\" trade, and their facilities were\r\n\"something considerable.\" Their toning, fixing, and washing baths were\r\nalmost worthy the name of vats.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Masury and Silsby were also early producers of photographs in\r\nBoston, and in 1854 employed a very clever operator, Mr. Turner, who\r\nobtained beautiful and brilliant negatives by iron development. On the\r\nwhole, I think Boston was ahead of New York for enterprise and the use\r\nof mechanical appliances in connection with photography. I sold my\r\ncolours to most of the Daguerreotypists, and entered into business\r\nrelations with two of the dealers, Messrs. French and Cramer, to stock\r\nthem, and then started for New York to make arrangements for my return\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to New York the season was over, and everyone was\r\nsupposed to be away at Saratoga Springs, Niagara Falls, Rockaway, and\r\nother fashionable resorts; but I found the Daguerreotype galleries all\r\nopen and doing a considerable stroke of business among the cotton\r\nplanters and slave holders, who had left the sultry south for the cooler\r\natmosphere of the more northern States. The Daguerreotype process was\r\nthen in the zenith of its perfection and popularity, and largely\r\npatronised by gentlemen from the south, especially for large or double\r\nwhole-plates, about 16 by 12 inches, for which they paid fifty dollars\r\neach. It was only the best houses that made a feature of these large\r\npictures, for it was not many of the Daguerreans that possessed a\r\n\"mammoth tube and box\"--_i.e._, lens and camera--or the necessary\r\nmachinery to \"get up\" such large surfaces, but all employed the best\r\nmechanical means for cleaning and polishing their plates, and it was\r\nthis that enabled the Americans to produce more brilliant pictures than\r\nwe did. Many people used to say it was the climate, but it was nothing\r\nof the kind. The superiority of the American Daguerreotype was entirely\r\ndue to mechanical appliances. Having completed my business arrangements\r\nand left my colours on sale with the principal stock dealers, including\r\nthe Scovill Manufacturing Company, Messrs. Anthony, and Levi Chapman.\r\n\r\nI sailed from New York in October 1854, and arrived in England in due\r\ntime without any mishap, and visiting London again as soon as I could, I\r\ncalled at Mr. Mayall's gallery in Regent Street to see Dr. Bushnell,\r\nwhom I knew in Philadelphia, and who was then operating for Mr. Mayall.\r\nWhile there Mr. Mayall came in from the Guildhall, and announced the\r\nresult of the famous trial, \"Talbot _versus_ Laroche,\" a verbatim report\r\nof which is given in the Journal of the Photographic Society for\r\nDecember 21st, 1854. Mr. Mayall was quite jubilant, and well he might\r\nbe, for the verdict for the defendant removed the trammels which Mr. Fox\r\nTalbot attempted to impose upon the practice of the collodion process,\r\nwhich was Frederick Scott Archer's gift to photographers. That was the\r\nfirst time that I had met Mr. Mayall, though I had heard of him and\r\nfollowed him both at Philadelphia and New York, and even at Niagara\r\nFalls. At that time Mr. Mayall was relinquishing the Daguerreotype\r\nprocess, though one of the earliest practitioners, for he was in\r\nbusiness as a Daguerreotypist in Philadelphia from 1842 to 1846, and I\r\nknow that he made a Daguerreotype portrait of James Anderson, the\r\ntragedian, in Philadelphia, on Sunday, May 18th, 1845. During part of\r\nthe time that he was in Philadelphia he was in partnership with Marcus\r\nRoot, and the name of the firm was \"Highschool and Root,\" and about the\r\nend of 1846 Mr. Mayall opened a Daguerreotype studio in the Adelaide\r\nGallery, King William Street, Strand, London, under the name of\r\nProfessor Highschool, and soon after that he opened a Daguerreotype\r\ngallery in his own name in the Strand, which establishment he sold to\r\nMr. Jabez Hughes in 1855. The best Daguerreotypists in London in 1854\r\nwere Mr. Beard, King William Street, London Bridge; Messrs. Kilburn, T.\r\nR. Williams and Claudet, in Regent Street; and W. H. Kent, in Oxford\r\nStreet. The latter had just returned from America, and brought all the\r\nlatest improvements with him. Messrs. Henneman and Malone were in Regent\r\nStreet doing calotype portraits. Henneman had been a servant to Fox\r\nTalbot, and worked his process under favourable conditions. Mr. Lock was\r\nalso in Regent Street, doing coloured photographs. He offered me a\r\nsituation at once, if I could colour photographs as well as I could\r\ncolour Daguerreotypes, but I could not, for the processes were totally\r\ndifferent. M. Manson, an old Frenchman, was the chief Daguerreotype\r\ncolourist in London, and worked for all the principal Daguerreotypists.\r\nI met the old gentleman first in 1851, and knew him for many years\r\nafterwards. He also made colours for sale. Not meeting with anything to\r\nsuit me in London, I returned to the North, calling at Birmingham on my\r\nway, where I met Mr. Whitlock, the chief Daguerreotypist there, and a\r\nMr. Monson, who professed to make Daguerreotypes and all other types.\r\nPaying a visit to Mr. Elisha Mander, the well-known photographic case\r\nmaker, I learnt that Mr. Jabez Hughes, then in business in Glasgow, was\r\nin want of an assistant, a colourist especially. Having met Mr. Hughes\r\nin Glasgow in 1852, and knowing what kind of man he was, I wrote to him,\r\nand was engaged in a few days. I went to Glasgow in January, 1855, and\r\nthen commenced business relations and friendship with Mr. Hughes that\r\nlasted unbroken until his death in 1884. My chief occupation was to\r\ncolour the Daguerreotypes taken by Mr. Hughes, and occasionally take\r\nsitters, when Mr. Hughes was busy, in another studio. I had not,\r\nhowever, been long in Glasgow, when Mr. Hughes determined to return to\r\nLondon. At first he wished me to accompany him, but it was ultimately\r\narranged that I should purchase the business, and remain in Glasgow,\r\nwhich I did, and took possession in June, Mr. Hughes going to Mr.\r\nMayall's old place in the Strand, London. Mr. Hughes had been in Glasgow\r\nfor nearly seven years, and had done a very good business, going first\r\nas operator to Mr. Bernard, and succeeding to the business just as I was\r\ndoing. While Mr. Hughes was in Glasgow he was very popular, not only as\r\na Daguerreotypist, but as a lecturer. He delivered a lecture on\r\nphotography at the Literary and Philosophical Society, became an active\r\nmember of the Glasgow Photographic Society, and an enthusiastic member\r\nof the St. Mark's Lodge of Freemasons. Only a day or two before he left\r\nGlasgow, he occupied the chair at a meeting of photographers, comprising\r\nDaguerreotypists and collodion workers, to consider what means could be\r\nadopted to check the downward tendency of prices even in those early\r\ndays. I was present, and remember seeing a lady Daguerreotypist among\r\nthe company, and she expressed her opinion quite decidedly. Efforts were\r\nmade to enter into a compact to maintain good prices, but nothing came\r\nof it. Like all such bandings together, the band was quickly and easily\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to retain the best of Mr. Hughes's customers, and\r\nmake new ones of my own, as well as many staunch and valuable friends,\r\nboth among what I may term laymen and brother Masons, while I resided in\r\nGlasgow. Most of my sitters were of the professional classes, and the\r\n_elite_ of the city, among whom were Sir Archibald Alison, the\r\nhistorian, Col. (now General) Sir Archibald Alison, Dr. Arnott,\r\nProfessor Ramsey, and many of the princely merchants and manufacturers.\r\nSome of my other patrons--for I did all kinds of photographic work--were\r\nthe late Norman Macbeth, Daniel McNee (afterwards Sir Daniel), and\r\nPresident of the Scottish Academy of Art, and also Her Majesty the\r\nQueen, for she bought two of my photographs of Glasgow Cathedral, and a\r\ncopy of my illustration of Hood's \"Song of the Shirt,\" copies of which I\r\npossess now, and doubtless so does Her Majesty. One of the most\r\ninteresting portraits I remember taking while I was in Glasgow was that\r\nof John Robertson, who constructed the first marine steam engine. He was\r\nassociated with Henry Bell, and fitted the \"Comet\" with her engine. Mr.\r\nNapier senr., the celebrated engineer on the Clyde, brought Robertson to\r\nsit to me, and ordered a great many copies. I also took a portrait of\r\nHarry Clasper, of rowing and boat-building notoriety, which was engraved\r\nand published in the _Illustrated London News_. Several of my portraits\r\nwere engraved both on wood and steel, and published. At the photographic\r\nexhibition in connection with the meeting of the British Association\r\nheld in Glasgow, in 1855, I saw the largest collodion positive on glass\r\nthat ever was made to my knowledge. The picture was thirty-six inches\r\nlong, a view of Gourock, or some such place down the Clyde, taken by Mr.\r\nKibble. The glass was British plate, and cost about L1. I thought it a\r\ngreat evidence of British pluck to attempt such a size. When I saw Mr.\r\nKibble I told him so, and expressed an opinion that I thought it a waste\r\nof time, labour, and money not to have made a negative when he was at\r\nsuch work. He took the hint, and at the next photographic exhibition he\r\nshowed a silver print the same size. Mr. Kibble was an undoubted\r\nenthusiast, and kept a donkey to drag his huge camera from place to\r\nplace. My pictures frequently appeared at the Glasgow exhibition, but at\r\none, which was burnt down, I lost all my Daguerreotype views of Niagara\r\nFalls, Whipple's views of the moon, and many other valuable pictures,\r\nportraits, and views, which could never be replaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THIRD PERIOD.\r\n\r\n  COLLODION.\r\n\r\n  FREDERICK SCOTT ARCHER.\r\n  _From Glass Positive by R. Cade, Ipswich. 1855._\r\n\r\n  HEVER CASTLE, KENT.\r\n  _Copy of Glass Positive taken by F. Scott Archer in 1849._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD PERIOD.\r\n\r\nCOLLODION TRIUMPHANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1857 I abandoned the Daguerreotype process entirely, and took to\r\ncollodion solely; and, strangely enough, that was the year that\r\nFrederick Scott Archer, the inventor, died. Like Daguerre, he did not\r\nlong survive the publication and popularity of his invention, nor did he\r\nlive long enough to see his process superseded by another. In years,\r\nhonours, and emoluments, he fell far short of Daguerre, but his process\r\nhad a much longer existence, was of far more commercial value,\r\nbenefitting private individuals and public bodies, and creating an\r\nindustry that expanded rapidly, and gave employment to thousands all\r\nover the world; yet he profited little by his invention, and when he\r\ndied, a widow and three children were left destitute. Fortunately a few\r\ninfluential friends bestirred themselves in their interest, and when the\r\nappeal was made to photographers and the public to the Archer\r\nTestimonial, the following is what appeared in the pages of _Punch_,\r\nJune 13th, 1857:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To the Sons of the Sun.\r\n\r\n\"The inventor of collodion has died, leaving his invention unpatented,\r\nto enrich thousands, and his family unportioned to the battle of life.\r\nNow, one expects a photographer to be almost as sensitive as the\r\ncollodion to which Mr. Scott Archer helped him. A deposit of silver is\r\nwanted (gold will do), and certain faces, now in the dark chamber, will\r\nlight up wonderfully, with an effect never before equalled by\r\nphotography. A respectable ancient writes that the statue of Fortitude\r\nwas the only one admitted to the Temple of the Sun. Instead whereof, do\r\nyou, photographers, set up Gratitude in your little glass temples of the\r\nsun, and sacrifice, according to your means, in memory of the benefactor\r\nwho gave you the deity for a household god. Now, answers must not be\r\nnegatives.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of that appeal, and the labours of the gentlemen who so\r\ngenerously interested themselves on behalf of the widow and orphans, was\r\nhighly creditable to photographers, the Photographic Society, Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers, and Her Majesty the Queen. What those labours were,\r\nfew now can have any conception; but I think the very best way to convey\r\nan idea of those labours and their successful results will be to reprint\r\na copy of the final report of the committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Committee of the Archer Testimonial.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee of the Archer Testimonial, considering it necessary to\r\nfurnish a statement of the course pursued towards the attainment of\r\ntheir object, desire to lay before the subscribers and the public\r\ngenerally a full report of their proceedings.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after the death of Mr. F. Scott Archer, a preliminary meeting\r\nof a few friends was held, and it was determined that a printed address\r\nshould be issued to the photographic world.\r\n\r\n\"Sir William Newton, cordially co-operating in the movement, at once\r\nmade application to Her Most Gracious Majesty. The Queen, with her usual\r\npromptitude and kindness of heart, forwarded a donation of L20 towards\r\nthe Testimonial. The Photographic Society of London, at the same time,\r\nproposed a grant of L50, and this liberality on the part of the Society\r\nwas followed by an announcement of a list of donations from individual\r\nmembers, which induced your Committee to believe that if an appeal were\r\nmade to the public, and those practising the photographic art, a sum\r\nmight be raised sufficiently large, not only to relieve the immediate\r\nwants of the widow and children, but to purchase a small annuity, and\r\nthus in a slight degree compensate for the heavy loss they had sustained\r\nby the premature death of one to whom the photographic art had already\r\nbecome deeply indebted.\r\n\r\n\"To aid in the accomplishment of this design, Mr. Mayall placed the use\r\nof his rooms at the service of a committee then about to be formed. Sir\r\nWilliam Newton and Mr. Roger Fenton consented to act as treasurers to\r\nthe fund, and the Union, and London and Westminster Banks kindly\r\nundertook to receive subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\"Your Committee first met on the 8th day of June, 1857, Mr. Digby Wyatt\r\nbeing called to the chair, when it was resolved to ask the consent of\r\nProfessors Delamotte and Goodeve to become joint secretaries. These\r\nduties were willingly accepted, and subscription lists opened in various\r\nlocalities in furtherance of the Testimonial.\r\n\r\n\"Your Committee met on the 8th day of July, and again on the 4th day of\r\nSeptember, when, on each occasion, receipts were announced and paid into\r\nthe bankers.\r\n\r\n\"The Society of Arts having kindly offered, through their Secretary, the\r\nuse of apartments in the house of the Society for any further meetings,\r\nyour Committee deemed it expedient to accept the same, and passed a vote\r\nof thanks to Mr. Mayall for the accommodation previously afforded by\r\nthat gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Your Committee, believing that the interests of the fund would be\r\nbetter served by a short delay in their proceedings, resolved on\r\ndeferring their next meeting until the month of November, or until the\r\nPhotographic Society should resume its meetings, when a full attendance\r\nof members might be anticipated; it being apparent that individually and\r\ncollectively persons in the provinces had withheld their subscriptions\r\nuntil the grant of the Photographic Society of London had been formally\r\nsanctioned at a special meeting convened for the purpose, and that their\r\nobject--the purchase of an annuity for Mrs. Archer and her\r\nchildren--could only be effected by the most active co-operation among\r\nall classes.\r\n\r\n\"Your Committee again met on the 26th of November, when it was resolved\r\nto report progress to the general body of subscribers, and that a public\r\nmeeting be called for the purpose, at which the Lord Chief Baron Pollock\r\nshould be requested to preside. To this request the Lord Chief Baron\r\nmost kindly and promptly acceded; and your Committee determined to seek\r\nthe co-operation of their photographic friends and the public to enable\r\nthem to carry out in its fullest integrity the immediate object of\r\nsecuring some small acknowledgment for the eminent services rendered to\r\nphotography by the late Mr. Archer.\r\n\r\n\"At this meeting it was stated that an impression existed, which to some\r\nextent still exists, that Mr. Archer was not the originator of the\r\nCollodion Process; your Committee, therefore, think it their duty to\r\nstate emphatically that they are fully satisfied of the great importance\r\nof the services rendered by him, as an original inventor, to the art of\r\nphotography.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Hunt, having studied during twenty years the beautiful art of\r\nphotography in all its details, submitted to the Committee the following\r\nexplanation of Mr. Archer's just right:--\r\n\r\n\"'As there appears to be some misconception of the real claim of Mr.\r\nArcher to be considered as a _discoverer_, it is thought desirable to\r\nstate briefly and distinctly what we owe to him. There can be no doubt\r\nthat much of the uncertainty which has been thought by some persons to\r\nsurround the introduction of collodion, has arisen from the unobtrusive\r\ncharacter of Mr. Archer himself, who deferred for a considerable period\r\n_the publication of the process of which he was the discoverer_.\r\n\r\n\"'When Professor Schoenbein, of Basle, introduced gun-cotton at the\r\nmeeting of the British Association at Southampton in 1846, the\r\nsolubility of this curious substance in ether was alluded to. Within a\r\nshort time collodion was employed in our hospitals for the purposes of\r\ncovering with a film impervious to air abraded surfaces on the body; its\r\npeculiar electrical condition was also known and exhibited by Mr. Hall,\r\nof Dartford, and others.\r\n\r\n\"'The beautiful character of the collodion film speedily led to the idea\r\nof using it as a medium for receiving photographic agents, and\r\nexperiments were made by spreading the collodion on paper and on glass,\r\nto form with it sensitive tablets. These experiments were all failures,\r\nowing to the circumstance that the collodion was regarded merely as a\r\nsheet upon which the photographic materials were to be spread; the dry\r\ncollodion film being in all cases employed.\r\n\r\n\"'To Mr. Archer, who spent freely both time and money in experimental\r\nresearch, it first occurred to dissolve in the collodion itself the\r\niodide of potassium. By this means he removed every difficulty, and\r\nbecame the inventor of the collodion process. The pictures thus obtained\r\nwere exhibited, and some of the details of the process communicated by\r\nMr. Scott Archer in confidence to friends before he published his\r\nprocess. This led, very unfortunately, to experiments by others in the\r\nsame direction, and hence there have arisen claims in opposition to\r\nthose of this lamented photographer. Everyone, however, acquainted with\r\nthe early history of the collodion process freely admits that Mr. Archer\r\nwas the _sole inventor of iodized collodion_, and of those manipulatory\r\ndetails which still, with very slight modifications, constitute the\r\ncollodion process, and he was the first person who published any account\r\nof the application of this remarkable accelerating agent, by which the\r\nmost important movement has been given to the art of photography.'\r\n\r\n\"Your committee, in May last, heard with deep regret of the sudden death\r\nof the widow, Mrs. Archer, which melancholy event caused a postponement\r\nof the general meeting resolved upon in November last. Sir Wm. Newton\r\nthereupon resolved to make another effort to obtain a pension for the\r\nthree orphan children, now more destitute than ever, and so earnestly\r\ndid he urge their claim upon the Minister, Lord Derby, that a reply came\r\nthe same day from his lordship's private secretary, saying, 'The Queen\r\nhas been pleased to approve of a pension of fifty pounds per annum being\r\npaid from the Civil List to the children of the late Mr. Frederick Scott\r\nArcher, in consideration of the scientific discoveries of their father,'\r\nhis lordship adding his regrets 'that the means at his disposal have not\r\nenabled him to do more in this case.' Your committee, to mark their\r\nsense of the value of the services rendered to the cause by Sir William\r\nNewton, thereupon passed a vote of thanks to him. In conclusion, your\r\ncommittee have to state that a trust deed has been prepared, free of\r\ncharge, by Henry White, Esq., of 7, Southampton Street, which conveys\r\nthe fund collected to trustees, to be by them invested in the public\r\nsecurities for the sole benefit of the orphan children. The sum in the\r\nUnion Bank now amounts to L549 11s. 4d., exclusive of interest, and the\r\nvarious sums--in all about L68--paid over to Mrs. Archer last year. Thus\r\nfar, the result is a subject for congratulation to the subscribers and\r\nyour committee, whose labours have hitherto not been in vain. Your\r\ncommittee are, nevertheless, of opinion that an appeal to Parliament\r\nmight be productive of a larger recognition of the claim of these orphan\r\nchildren--a claim not undeserving the recognition of the Legislature,\r\nwhen the inestimable boon bestowed upon the country is duly considered.\r\nSince March 1851, when Mr. Archer described his process in the pages of\r\nthe _Chemist_, how many thousands must in some way or other have been\r\nmade acquainted with the immense advantages it offers over all other\r\nprocesses in the arts, and how many instances could be adduced in\r\ntestimony of its usefulness? For instance, its value to the Government\r\nduring the last war, in the engineering department, the construction of\r\nfield works, and in recording observations of historical and scientific\r\ninterest. Your committee noticed that an attractive feature of the\r\nPhotographic Society's last exhibition was a series of drawings and\r\nplans, executed by the Royal Engineers, in reduction of various ordnance\r\nmaps, at a saving estimated at L30,000 to the country. The\r\nnon-commissioned officers of this corps are now trained in this art, and\r\nsent to different foreign stations, so that in a few years there will be\r\na network of photographic stations spread over the world, and having\r\ntheir results recorded in the War Department, and, in a short time, all\r\nthe world will be brought under the subjugation of art.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Warren De la Rue exhibited to the Astronomical Society, November,\r\n1857, photographs of the moon and Jupiter, taken by the collodion\r\nprocess in five seconds, of which the Astronomer-Royal said, 'that a\r\nstep of very great importance had been made, and that, either as regards\r\nthe self-delineation of clusters of stars, nebulae, and planets, or the\r\nself-registration of observations, it is impossible at present to\r\nestimate the value.' When admiring the magnificent photographic prints\r\nwhich are now to be seen in almost every part of the civilized world, an\r\ninvoluntary sense of gratitude towards the discoverer of the collodion\r\nprocess must be experienced, and it cannot but be felt how much the\r\nworld is indebted to Mr. Archer for having placed at its command the\r\nmeans by which such beautiful objects are presented. How many thousands\r\namongst those who owe their means of subsistence to this process must\r\nhave experienced such a feeling of gratitude? It is upon such\r\nconsiderations that the public have been, and still are, invited to\r\nassist in securing for the orphan children of the late Mr. Archer some\r\nfitting appreciation of the service which he rendered to science, art,\r\nhis country--nay, to the whole world.\r\n\r\n\"M. Digby Wyatt, _Chairman_,\r\n\r\n\"Jabez Hogg, _Secretary to Committee_.\r\n\r\n\"_Society of Arts, July, 1858._\"\r\n\r\nAfter reading that report, and especially Mr. Hunt's remarks, it will\r\nappear evident to all that even that act of charity, gratitude, and\r\njustice could not be carried through without someone raising objections\r\nand questioning the claims of Frederick Scott Archer as the original\r\ninventor of the Collodion process. Nearly all the biographers and\r\nhistorians of photography have coupled other names with Archer's, either\r\nas assistants or co-inventors, but I have evidence in my possession that\r\nwill prove that neither Fry nor Diamond afforded Archer any assistance\r\nwhatever, and that Archer preceded all the other claimants in his\r\napplication of collodion. In support of the first part of this\r\nstatement, I shall give extracts from Mrs. Archer's letter, now in my\r\npossession, which, I think, will set that matter at rest for ever. Mrs.\r\nArcher, writing from Bishop Stortford on December 7th, 1857, says, \"When\r\nMr. A. prepared pupils for India he always taught the paper process as\r\nwell as the Collodion, for fear the chemicals should cause\r\ndisappointment in a hot climate, as I believe that the negative paper he\r\nprepared differed from that in general use. I enclosed a specimen made\r\nin our glass house.\r\n\r\n\"In Mr. Hunt's book, as well as Mr. Horne's, Mr. Fry's name is joined\r\nwith Mr. Archer's as the originators of the Collodion process.\r\n\r\n\"Should Mr. Hunt seem to require any corroboration of what I have stated\r\nrespecting Mr. Fry, I can send you many of Mr. Fry's notes of\r\ninvitation, when Mr. A. merely gave him lessons in the application of\r\ncollodion, and Mr. Brown gave me the correspondence which passed between\r\nhim and Mr. Fry on the subject at the time Mr. Home's book was\r\npublished. I did not send up those papers, for, unless required, it is\r\nuseless to dwell on old grievances, but I should like such a man as Mr.\r\nHunt to understand _how_ the association of the two names originated.\"\r\n\r\nAs to priority of application, the following letter ought to settle that\r\npoint:--\r\n\r\n\"_Alma Cottage, Bishop Stortford._\r\n\r\n\"_9th December, 1857._\r\n\r\n\"Sir,--My hunting has at length proved successful. In the enclosed book\r\nyou will find notes respecting the paper pulp, albumen, tanno-gelatine,\r\nand collodion. You will therein see Mr. Archer's notes of iod-collodion\r\nin 1849. You may wonder that I could not find this note-book before, but\r\nthe numbers of papers that there are, and the extreme disorder, defy\r\ndescription. My head was in such a deplorable state before I left that I\r\ncould arrange nothing. Those around me were most anxious to destroy _all\r\nthe papers_, and I had great trouble to keep all with Mr. Archer's\r\nhandwriting upon them, however dirty and rubbishing they might appear,\r\nso they were huddled together, a complete chaos. I look back with the\r\ngreatest thankfulness that my brain did not completely lose its balance,\r\nfor I had not a single relative who entered into Mr. Archer's pursuits,\r\nso that they could not possibly assist me.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Archer being of so reserved a character, I had to _find out_ where\r\neverything was, and my search has been amongst different things. I need\r\nnot tell you that I hope this dirty enclosure will be taken care of.\r\n\r\n\"The paper pulp occupied much time; in fact, notes were only made of\r\narticles which had been much tried, which might probably be brought into\r\nuse.--I am, sir, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\"_J. Hogg, Esq._\r\nF. G. Archer.\"\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing is not evidence sufficient, I have by me a very good\r\n_glass positive_ of Hever Castle, Kent, which was taken in the spring of\r\n1849, and two collodion negatives made by Mr. Archer in the autumn of\r\n1848; and these dates are all vouched for by Mr. Jabez Hogg, who was Mr.\r\nArcher's medical attendant and friend, and knew him long before he began\r\nhis experiments with collodion--whereas I cannot find a trace even of\r\nthe _suggestion_ of the application of collodion in the practice of\r\nphotography either by Gustave Le Gray or J. R. Bingham prior to 1849;\r\nwhile Mr. Archer's note-book proves that he was not only iodizing\r\ncollodion at that date, but making experiments with paper pulp and\r\n_gelatine_; so that Mr. Archer was not only the inventor of the\r\ncollodion process, but was on the track of its destroyer even at that\r\nearly date. He also published his method of bleaching positives and\r\nintensifying negatives with bichloride of mercury.\r\n\r\nFrederick Scott Archer was born at Bishop Stortford in 1813, but there\r\nis little known of his early life, and what little there is I will allow\r\nMrs. Archer to tell in her own way.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,--I do not know whether the enclosed is what you require; if\r\nnot, be kind enough to let me know, and I must try to supply you with\r\nsomething better. I thought you merely required particulars relating to\r\nphotography. Otherwise Mr. Archer's career was a singular one: Losing\r\nhis parents in childhood, he lived in a world of his own; I think you\r\nknow he was apprenticed to a bullion dealer in the city, where the most\r\nbeautiful antique gems and coins of all nations being constantly before\r\nhim, gave him the desire to model the figures, and led him to the study\r\nof numismatics. He worked so hard at nights at these pursuits that his\r\nmaster gave up the last two years of his time to save his life. He only\r\nrequested him to be on the premises, on account of his extreme\r\nconfidence in him.\r\n\r\n\"Many other peculiarities I could mention, but I dare say you know them\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n\"I will send a small case to you, containing some early specimens and\r\ngutta-percha negatives, with a copy of Mr. A.'s portrait, which I found\r\non leaving Great Russell Street, and have had several printed from it.\r\nIt is not a good photograph, but I think you will consider it a\r\nlikeness. I am, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\"_J. Hogg, Esq._\r\nF. G. Archer.\"\r\n\r\nFrederick Scott Archer pursued the double occupation of sculptor and\r\nphotographer at 105, Great Russell Street. It was there he so\r\npersistently persevered in his photographic experiments, and there he\r\ndied in May, 1857, and was interred in Kensal Green Cemetery. A\r\nreference to the report of the Committee will show what was done for his\r\nbereaved family--a widow and three children. Mrs. Archer followed her\r\nhusband in March, 1858, and two of the children died early; but one,\r\nAlice (unmarried), is still alive and in receipt of the Crown pension of\r\nfifty pounds per annum.\r\n\r\nWhile the collodion episode in the history of photography is before my\r\nreaders, and especially as the process is rapidly becoming extinct, I\r\nthink this will be a suitable place to insert Archer's instructions for\r\nmaking a _soluble_ gun-cotton, iodizing collodion, developing, and\r\nfixing the photographic image.\r\n\r\n  _Gun-Cotton_ (_or Pyroxaline, as it was afterwards named_).\r\n\r\n    Take of dry nitre in powder         40 parts\r\n    Sulphuric acid                      60   \"\r\n    Cotton                               2   \"\r\n\r\nThe sulphuric acid and the nitre were mixed together, and immediately\r\nthe latter was all dissolved, the gun-cotton was added and well stirred\r\nwith a glass rod for about two minutes; then the cotton was plunged into\r\na large bowl of water and well washed with repeated changes of water\r\nuntil the acid and nitre were washed away. The cotton was then pressed\r\nand dried, and converted into collodion by dissolving 30 grains of\r\ngun-cotton in 18 fluid ounces of ether and 2 ounces of alcohol--putting\r\nthe cotton into the ether first, and then adding the alcohol; the\r\ncollodion allowed to settle and decanted prior to iodizing. The latter\r\noperation was performed by adding a sufficient quantity of iodide of\r\nsilver to each ounce of the plain collodion. Mr. Archer tells how to\r\nmake the iodide of silver, but the quantity is regulated by the quantity\r\nof alcohol in the collodion. When the iodized collodion was ready for\r\nuse, a glass plate was cleaned and coated with it, and then sensitised\r\nby immersion in a bath of nitrate of silver solution--30 grains of\r\nnitrate of silver to each ounce of distilled water. From three to five\r\nminutes' immersion in the silver bath was generally sufficient to\r\nsensitise the plate. This, of course, had to be done in what is commonly\r\ncalled a _dark room_. After exposure in the camera, the picture was\r\ndeveloped by pouring over the surface of the plate a solution of\r\npyrogallic acid of the following proportions:--\r\n\r\n    Pyrogallic acid                    5 grains\r\n    Distilled water                   10 ounces\r\n    Glacial acetic acid               40 minims\r\n\r\nAfter the development of the picture it was washed and fixed in a\r\nsolution of hyposulphite of soda, 4 ounces to 1 pint of water. The plate\r\nwas then washed and dried. This is an epitome of the whole of Archer's\r\nprocess for making either negatives or positives on glass, the\r\ndifference being effected by varying the time of exposure and\r\ndevelopment. Of course the process was somewhat modified and simplified\r\nby experience and commercial enterprise. Later on bromides were added to\r\nthe collodion, an iron developer employed, and cyanide of potassium as a\r\nfixing agent; but the principle remained the same from first to last.\r\n\r\nWhen pyrogallic acid was first employed in photography, it was quoted\r\nat 21s. per oz., and, if I remember rightly, I paid 3s. for the first\r\n_drachm_ that I purchased. On referring to an old price list I find\r\nDaguerreotype plates, 2-1/2 by 2 inches, quoted at 12s. per dozen;\r\nnitrate of silver, 5s. 6d. per oz.; chloride of gold, 5s. 6d. for\r\n15 grains; hyposulphite of soda at 5s. per lb.; and a half-plate rapid\r\nportrait lens by Voightlander, of Vienna, at L60. Those were the days\r\nwhen photography might well be considered expensive, and none but the\r\nwealthy could indulge in its pleasures and fascinations.\r\n\r\nWhile I lived in Glasgow, competition was tolerably keen, even then,\r\nand amongst the best \"glass positive men\" were Messrs. Bibo, Bowman,\r\nJ. Urie, and Young and Sun, as the latter styled himself; and in\r\nphotographic portraiture, plain and coloured, by the collodion process,\r\nwere Messrs. Macnab and J. Stuart. From the time that I relinquished the\r\nDaguerreotype process, in 1857, I devoted my attention to the production\r\nof high-class collodion negatives. I never took kindly to _glass\r\npositives_, though I had done some as early as 1852. They were never\r\nequal in beauty and delicacy to a good Daguerreotype, and their low tone\r\nwas to me very objectionable. I considered the Ferrotype the best form\r\nof collodion positive, and did several of them, but my chief work was\r\nplain and coloured prints from collodion negatives, also small portraits\r\non visiting cards.\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1860, my home and business were destroyed by fire, and\r\nI lost all my old and new specimens of Daguerreotypes and photographs,\r\nall my Daguerreotype and other apparatus, and nearly everything I\r\npossessed. As I was only partially insured, I suffered considerable\r\nloss. After settling my affairs I decided on going to America again and\r\ntrying my luck in New York. Family ties influenced this decision\r\nconsiderably, or I should not have left Glasgow, where I was both\r\nprosperous and respected. To obtain an idea of the latest and best\r\naspects of photography, I visited London and Paris.\r\n\r\nThe carte-de-visite form of photography had not exhibited much vitality\r\nat that period in London, but in Paris it was beginning to be popular.\r\nWhile in London I accompanied Mr. Jabez Hughes to the meeting of the\r\nPhotographic Society, Feb. 7th, 1860, the Right Honorable the Lord Chief\r\nBaron Pollock in the chair, when the report of the Collodion Committee\r\nwas delivered. The committee, consisting of F. Bedford, P. Delamotte,\r\nDr. Diamond, Roger Fenton, Jabez Hughes, T. A. Malone, J. H. Morgan, H.\r\nP. Robinson, Alfred Rosling, W. Russell Sedgefield, J. Spencer, and T.\r\nR. Williams, strongly recommended Mr. Hardwich's formula. That was my\r\nfirst visit to the Society, and I certainly did not think then that I\r\nshould ever see it again, or become and be a member for twenty-two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI sailed from Liverpool in the ss. _City of Baltimore_ in March, and\r\nreached New York safely in April, 1860. I took time to look about me,\r\nand visited all the \"galleries\" on Broadway, and other places, before\r\ndeciding where I should locate myself. Many changes had taken place\r\nduring the six years I had been absent. Nearly all the old\r\nDaguerreotypists were still in existence, but all of them, with the\r\nexception of Mr. Brady, had abandoned the Daguerreotype process, and Mr.\r\nBrady only retained it for small work. Most of the chief galleries had\r\nbeen moved higher up Broadway, and a mania of magnificence had taken\r\npossession of most of the photographers. Mr. Anson was the first to make\r\na move in that direction by opening a \"superb gallery\" on the ground\r\nfloor in Broadway right opposite the Metropolitan Hotel, filling his\r\nwindows with life-sized photographs coloured in oil at the back, which\r\nhe called Diaphanotypes. He did a large business in that class of work,\r\nespecially among visitors from the Southern States; but that was soon to\r\nend, for already there were rumours of war, but few then gave it any\r\nserious consideration.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Gurney and Sons' gallery was also a very fine one, but not on\r\nthe ground floor. Their \"saloon\" was upstairs, This house was one of the\r\noldest in New York in connection with photography. In the very early\r\ndays, Mr. Gurney, senr., was one of the most eminent \"professors\" of the\r\nDaguerreotype process, and was one of the committee appointed to wait\r\nupon the Rev. Wm. Hill, a preacher in the Catskills, to negotiate with\r\nthe reverend gentlemen (?) for his vaunted secret of photography in\r\nnatural colours. As the art progressed, or the necessity for change\r\narose, Mr. Gurney was ready to introduce every novelty, and, in later\r\nyears, in conjunction with Mr. Fredericks, then in partnership with Mr.\r\nGurney, he introduced the \"Hallotype,\" not Hillotype, and the\r\n\"Ivorytype.\" Both these processes had their day. The former was\r\nphotography spoiled by the application of Canada balsam and very little\r\nart; the latter was the application of a great deal of art to spoil a\r\nphotograph. The largest of all the large galleries on Broadway was that\r\nof Messrs. Fredericks and Co. The whole of the ground and first floor\r\nwere thrown into one \"crystal front,\" and made a very attractive\r\nappearance. The windows were filled with life-sized portraits painted in\r\noil, crayons, and other styles, and the walls of the interior were\r\ncovered with life-sized portraits of eminent men and beautiful women.\r\nThe floor was richly carpeted, and the furnishing superb. A gallery ran\r\nround the walls to enable the visitors to view the upper pictures, and\r\nobtain a general view of the \"saloon,\" the _tout ensemble_ of which was\r\nmagnificent. From the ground floor an elegant staircase led to the\r\ngalleries, toilet and waiting rooms, and thence to the operating rooms\r\nor studios. Some of the Parisian galleries were fine, but nothing to be\r\ncompared with Fredericks', and the finest establishment in London did\r\nnot bear the slightest comparison.\r\n\r\nMr. Brady was another of the early workers of the Daguerreotype process,\r\nand probably the last of his _confreres_ to abandon it. He commenced\r\nbusiness in the early forties in Fulton Street, a long way down\r\nBroadway, but as the sea of commerce pressed on and rolled over the\r\nstrand of fashion, he was obliged to move higher and higher up Broadway,\r\nuntil he reached the corner of Tenth Street, nearly opposite Grace\r\nChurch. Mr. Brady appeared to set the Franklin maxim, \"Three removes as\r\nbad as a fire,\" at defiance, for he had made three or four moves to my\r\nknowledge--each one higher and higher to more elegant and expensive\r\npremises, each remove entailing the cost of more and more expensive\r\nfurnishing, until his latest effort in upholstery culminated in a superb\r\nsuite of black walnut and green silk velvet; in short, Longfellow's\r\n\"Excelsior\" appeared to be the motto of Mr. Brady.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Mead Brothers, Samuel Root, James Cady, and George Adams ought\r\nto receive \"honourable mention\" in connection with the art in New York,\r\nfor they were excellent operators in the Daguerreotype days, and all\r\nwere equally good manipulators of the collodion process and silver\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nAfter casting and sounding about, like a mariner seeking a haven on a\r\nstrange coast, I finally decided on buying a half interest in the\r\ngallery of Mead Brothers, 805, Broadway; Harry Mead retaining his, or\r\nhis wife's share of the business, but leaving me to manage the \"uptown\"\r\nbranch. This turned out to be an unfortunate speculation, which involved\r\nme in a lawsuit with one of Mead's creditors, and compelled me to get\r\nrid of a very unsatisfactory partner in the best way and at any cost\r\nthat I could. Mead's creditor, by some process of law that I could never\r\nunderstand, stripped the gallery of all that belonged to my partner, and\r\neven put in a claim for half of the fixtures. Over this I lost my\r\ntemper, and had to pay, not the piper, but the lawyer. I also found that\r\nMrs. Henry Mead had a bill of sale on her husband's interest in the\r\nbusiness, which I ended by buying her out. Husband and wife are very\r\nseldom one in America. Soon after getting the gallery into my own hands,\r\nrefurnishing and rearranging, the Prince of Wales's visit to New York\r\nwas arranged, and as the windows of my gallery commanded a good view of\r\nBroadway, I let most of them very advantageously, retaining the use of\r\none only for myself and family. There were so many delays, however, at\r\nthe City Hall and other places on the day of the procession, that it was\r\nalmost dark when the Prince reached 805, Broadway, and all my guests\r\nwere both weary of waiting so long, and disappointed at seeing so little\r\nof England's future King.\r\n\r\nWhen I recommenced business on Broadway on my own account there was only\r\none firm taking cartes-de-visite, and I introduced that form of portrait\r\nto my customers, but they did not take very kindly to it, though a house\r\nnot far from me was doing a very good business in that style at three\r\ndollars a dozen, and Messrs. Rockwood and Co. appeared to be\r\nmonopolising all the carte-de-visite business that was being done in New\r\nYork; but eventually I got in the thin edge of the wedge by exhibiting\r\n_four_ for one dollar. This ruse brought in sitters, and I began to do\r\nvery well until Abraham Lincoln issued his proclamation calling for one\r\nhundred thousand men to stamp out the Southern rebellion. I remember\r\nthat morning most distinctly. It was a miserably wet morning in April,\r\n1861, and all kinds of business received a shock. People looked\r\nbewildered, and thought of nothing but saving their money and reducing\r\ntheir expenses. It had a blighting effect on my business, and I, not\r\nknowing, like others, where it might land me, determined to get rid of\r\nmy responsibilities at any cost, so I sold my business for a great deal\r\nless than it was worth, and at a very serious loss. The outbreak of that\r\ngigantic civil war and a severe family bereavement combined, induced me\r\nto return to England as soon as possible. Before leaving America, in all\r\nprobability for ever, I went to Washington to bid some friends farewell,\r\nand while there I went into Virginia with a friend on Sunday morning,\r\nJuly 21st, and in the afternoon saw the smoke and heard the cannonading\r\nof the first battle of Bull Run, and witnessed, next morning, the rout\r\nand rush into Washington of the demoralised fragments of the Federal\r\narmy. I wrote and sent a description of the stampede to a friend in\r\nGlasgow, which he handed over to the _Glasgow Herald_ for publication,\r\nand I have reason to believe that my description of that memorable rout\r\nwas the first that was published in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could settle my affairs I left New York with my family, and\r\narrived in London on the 15th of September, 1861. It was a beautiful\r\nsunny day when I landed, and, after all the trouble and excitement I had\r\nso recently seen and experienced, London, despite its business and\r\nbustle, appeared like a heaven of peace.\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Hughes was about the last to wish me \"God speed\" when I left\r\nEngland, so he was the first I went to see when I returned. I found, to\r\nmy disappointment, that he was in Paris, but Mrs. Hughes gave me a\r\nhearty welcome. After a few days' sojourn in London I went to Glasgow\r\nwith the view of recommencing in that city, where I had many friends;\r\nbut while there, and on the very day that I was about to sign for the\r\nlease of a house, Mr. Hughes wrote to offer me the management of his\r\nbusiness in Oxford Street. It did not take me long to decide, and by\r\nreturn post that same night I wrote accepting the offer. I concluded all\r\nother arrangements as quickly as possible, returned to London, and\r\nentered upon my managerial duties on the 1st November, 1861. I had long\r\nwished and looked out for an opportunity to settle in London and enlarge\r\nmy circle of photographic acquaintance and experience, so I put on my\r\nnew harness with alacrity and pleasure.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest of my new acquaintances was George Wharton Simpson,\r\nEditor of the Photographic News. He called at Oxford Street one evening\r\nwhile I was the guest of Mr. Hughes, by whom we were introduced, and we\r\nspent a long, chatty, and pleasant evening together, talking over my\r\nAmerican experience and matters photographic; but, to my surprise, much\r\nof our conversation appeared in the next issue of his journal (_vide_\r\nPhotographic News, October 11th, 1861, pp. 480-1). But that was a power,\r\nI afterwards ascertained, which he possessed to an eminent degree, and\r\nwhich he utilized most successfully at his \"Wednesday evenings at home,\"\r\nwhen he entertained his photographic friends at Canonbury Road, N. Very\r\ndelightful and enjoyable those evenings were, and he never failed to\r\ncull paragraphs for the Photographic News from the busy brains of his\r\nnumerous visitors. He was a genial host, and his wife was a charming\r\nhostess; and his daughter Eva, now the wife of William Black the\r\nnovelist, often increased the charm of those evenings by the exhibition\r\nof her musical abilities. It is often a wonder to me that other editors\r\nof photographic journals don't pursue a similar plan, for those social\r\nre-unions were not only pleasant, but profitable to old friend Simpson.\r\nThrough Mr. Simpson's \"at homes,\" and my connection with Mr. Hughes, I\r\nmade the acquaintance of nearly all the eminent photographers of the\r\ntime, amongst whom may be mentioned W. G. Lacy, of Ryde, I.W. The latter\r\nwas a very sad and brief acquaintanceship, for he died in Mr. Hughes's\r\nsitting-room on the 21st November, 1861, in the presence of G. Wharton\r\nSimpson, Jabez Hughes, and myself, and, strangely enough, it was\r\nentirely through this death that Mr. Hughes went to Ryde, and became\r\nphotographer to the Queen. Mr. Lacy made his will in Mr. Hughes's\r\nsitting-room, and Mr. Simpson sole executor, who sold Mr. Lacy's\r\nbusiness in the Arcade, Ryde, I.W., to Mr. Hughes, and in the March\r\nfollowing he took possession, leaving me solely in charge of his\r\nbusiness in Oxford Street, London.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Mr. Skaife introduced his ingenious pistolgraph, but it\r\nwas rather in advance of the times, for the dry plates then in the\r\nmarket were not quite quick enough for \"snap shots,\" though I have seen\r\nsome fairly good pictures taken with the apparatus.\r\n\r\nAt this period a fierce controversy was raging about lunar photography,\r\nbut it was all unnecessary, as the moon had photographed herself under\r\nthe guidance of Mr. Whipple, of Boston, U.S., as early as 1853, and all\r\nthat was required to obtain a lunar picture was sufficient exposure.\r\n\r\nOn December 3rd, 1861, Thomas Ross read a paper and exhibited a\r\npanoramic lens and camera at a meeting of the Photographic Society, and\r\non the 15th October, 1889, I saw the same apparatus, in perfect\r\ncondition, exhibited as a curiosity at the Photographic Society's\r\nExhibition. No wonder the apparatus was in such good condition, for I\r\nshould think it had never been used but once. The plates were 10 inches\r\nlong, and curved like the crescent of a new moon. Cleaning board, dark\r\nslide, and printing-frame, were all curved. Fancy the expense and\r\ntrouble attending the use of such an apparatus; I should think it had\r\nfew buyers. Certainly I never sold one, and I never met with any person\r\nwho had bought one.\r\n\r\nAmateurs have ever been the most restless and discontented disciples of\r\nthe \"Fathers of Photography,\" always craving for something new, and\r\nseeking to lessen their labours and increase their facilities, and to\r\nthese causes we are chiefly indebted for the marvellous development and\r\nradical changes of photography. No sooner was the Daguerreotype process\r\nperfected than it was superseded by _wet_ collodion, and that was barely\r\na workable process when it became the anxiety of every amateur to have a\r\n_dry_ collodion process, and multitudes of men were at work endeavouring\r\nto make, modify, or invent a means that would enable them to use the\r\ncamera as a sort of sketch-book, and make their finished picture at home\r\nat their leisure. Hence the number of Dry Plate processes published\r\nabout this period, and the controversies carried on by the many\r\nenthusiastic champions of the various methods. Beer was pitted against\r\ntea and coffee, honey against albumen, gin against gum, but none of them\r\nwere equal to wet collodion.\r\n\r\nThe International Exhibition of 1862 did little or nothing in the\r\ninterests of photography. It is true there was a scattered and skied\r\nexhibition at the top of a high tower, but as there was no \"lift,\" I\r\nsuspect very few people went to see the exhibits. I certainly was not\r\nthere more than once myself. Among the exhibitors of apparatus were the\r\nnames of Messrs. McLean, Melhuish and Co., Murray and Heath, P. Meagher,\r\nT. Ottewill and Co., but there was nothing very remarkable among their\r\nexhibits. There was some very good workmanship, but the articles\r\nexhibited were not beyond the quality of the every-day manufacture of\r\nthe best camera and apparatus makers.\r\n\r\nThe chief contributors to the exhibition of photographs were Messrs.\r\nMayall, T. R. Williams, and Herbert Watkins in portraiture; and in\r\nlandscapes, &c., Messrs. Francis Bedford, Rejlander, Rouch, Stephen\r\nThompson, James Mudd, William Mayland, H. P. Robinson, and Breeze. By\r\nsome carelessness or stupidity on the part of the attendants or\r\nconstructors of the Exhibition, nearly all Mr. Breeze's beautiful\r\nexhibits--stereoscopes and stereoscopic transparencies--were destroyed\r\nby the fall of a skylight. Perhaps the best thing that the International\r\nExhibition did for photography was the issue of the Jurors' Report, as\r\nit was prefaced with a brief History of Photography up to date, not\r\nperfectly correct regarding the Rev. J. B. Reade's labours, but\r\notherwise good, the authorship of which I attribute to the late Dr.\r\nDiamond; but the awards--ah! well, awards never were quite satisfactory.\r\nCommendees thought they should have been medalists, and the latter\r\nthought something else. Thomas Ross, J. H. Dallmeyer, and Negretti and\r\nZambra were the English recipients of medals, and Voightlander and Son\r\nand C. Dietzler received medals for their lenses.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1862 the Harrison Globe Lens was attracting attention, and, as\r\nmuch was claimed for it both in width of angle and rapidity, I imported\r\nfrom New York a 5 by 4 and a whole-plate as samples. The 5 by 4 was an\r\nexcellent lens, and embraced a much wider angle than any other lens\r\nknown, and Mr. Hughes employed it to photograph the bridal bed and suite\r\nof apartments of the Prince and Princess of Wales at Osborne, Isle of\r\nWight, and I feel certain that no other lens would have done the work so\r\nwell. I have copies of the photograph by me now. They are circular\r\npictures of five inches in diameter, and every article and decoration\r\nvisible in the chambers are as sharp and crisp as possible. I showed the\r\nlens to Mr. Dallmeyer, and he thought he could make a better one; his\r\nWide-Angle Rectilinear was the result.\r\n\r\nMr. John Pouncy, of Dorchester, introduced his \"patent process for\r\npermanent printing\" this year, but it never made much headway. It was an\r\noleagenous process, mixed with bichromate of potash, or bitumen of\r\nJudea, and always smelt of bad fat. I possessed examples at the time,\r\nbut took no care of them, and no one else did in all probability; but it\r\nappeared to me to be the best means of transferring photographic\r\nimpressions to wood blocks for the engraver's purpose. Thomas Sutton,\r\nB.A., published a book on Pouncy's process and carbon printing, but the\r\nprocess had inherent defects which were not overcome, so nothing could\r\nmake it a success. Sutton's \"History of Carbon Printing\" was\r\nsufficiently interesting to attract both readers and buyers at the time.\r\n\r\nI have previously stated that Daguerre introduced and left his process\r\nin an imperfect and uncommercial condition, and that it was John\r\nFrederick Goddard, then lecturer at the Adelaide Gallery, London, and\r\ninventor of the polariscope, who discovered the accelerating properties\r\nof bromine, and by which, with iodine, he obtained a bromo-iodide of\r\nsilver on the surface of the silvered plate employed in the\r\nDaguerreotype process, thereby reducing the time of exposure from twenty\r\nminutes to twenty seconds, and making the process available for\r\nportraiture with an ordinary double combination lens. Somehow or other,\r\nthis worthy gentleman had fallen into adverse circumstances, and was\r\nobliged to eat the bread of charity in his old age. The facts of this\r\nsad case coming to the knowledge of Mr. Hughes and others, an appeal,\r\nwritten by Mr. Hughes, was published in the Photographic News, December\r\n11th, 1863. As Mr. Hughes and myself had benefitted by Mr. Goddard's\r\nimprovement in the practice of the Daguerreotype, we took an active\r\ninterest in the matter, and, by canvassing friends and customers,\r\nsucceeded in obtaining a considerable proportion of the sum total\r\nsubscribed for the relief of Mr. Goddard. Enough was obtained to make\r\nhim independent and comfortable for the remainder of his life. Mr. T. R.\r\nWilliams was appointed almoner by the committee, but his office was not\r\nfor long, as Mr. Goddard died Dec. 28th, 1866.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of April, 1864, I attended a meeting of the Photographic\r\nSociety at King's College, and heard Mr. J. W. Swan read a paper on his\r\nnew patent carbon process. It was a crowded meeting, and an intense\r\ninterest pervaded the minds of both members and visitors. The examples\r\nexhibited were very beautiful, but at that early stage they began to\r\nshow a weakness, which clung to the collodion support as long as it was\r\nemployed. Some of the specimens which I obtained at the time left the\r\nmounting boards, and the films were torn asunder by opposing forces, and\r\nthe pictures completely destroyed. I have one in my possession now in\r\nthat unsatisfactory condition. Mr. Swan's process was undoubtedly an\r\nadvance in the right direction, but it was still imperfect, and required\r\nfurther improvement. Many of the members failed to see where the patent\r\nrights came in, and Mr. Swan himself appeared to have qualms of\r\nconscience on the subject, for he rather apologetically announced in his\r\npaper, that he had obtained a patent, though his first intention was to\r\nallow it to be practised without any restriction. I think myself it\r\nwould have been wiser to have adhered to his original intention;\r\nhowever, it was left to others to do more to advance the carbon process\r\nthan he did.\r\n\r\nDuring this year (1865) an effort was made to establish a claim of\r\npriority in favour of Thomas Wedgwood for the honour of having made\r\nphotographs on silver plates, and negatives on paper, and examples of\r\nsuch alleged early works were submitted to the inspection of members of\r\nthe Photographic Society, but it was most satisfactorily determined that\r\nthe photographs on the silver plates were weak Daguerreotypes of a\r\nposterior date, and that the photographic prints, on paper, of a\r\nbreakfast table were from a calotype negative taken by Fox Talbot.\r\nMessrs. Henneman and Dr. Diamond proved this most conclusively. Other\r\nprints then exhibited, and alleged to be photographs, were nothing but\r\nprints from metal plates, produced by some process of engraving,\r\nprobably Aquatint. I saw some of the examples at the time, and, as\r\nrecently as Nov. 1st, 1889, I have seen some of them again, and I think\r\nthe \"Breakfast Table\" and a view of \"Wedgwood's Pottery\" are silver\r\nprints, though very much faded, from calotype negatives. The other\r\nprints, such as the \"Piper\" and \"A Vase,\" are from engraved plates. No\r\none can desire to lessen Thomas Wedgwood's claims to pre-eminence among\r\nthe early experimentalists with chloride of silver, but there cannot now\r\nbe any denial to the claims of the Rev. J. B. Reade in 1837, and Fox\r\nTalbot in 1840, of being the earliest producers of photographic\r\nnegatives on paper, from which numerous prints could be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Wothlytype printing process was introduced to the notice of\r\nphotographers and the public this year: first, by a blatant article in\r\nthe _Times_, which was both inaccurate and misleading, for it stated\r\nthat both nitrate of silver and hyposulphite of soda were dispensed\r\nwithin the process; secondly, by the issue of advertisements and\r\nprospectuses for the formation of a Limited Liability Company. I went\r\nto the Patent Office and examined the specification, and found that\r\nboth nitrate of silver and hyposulphite of soda were essential to the\r\npractice of the process, and that there was no greater guarantee of\r\npermanency in the use of the Wothlytype than in ordinary silver\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nOn March 14th, 1865, George Wharton Simpson, editor and proprietor of\r\nthe _Photographic News_, read a paper at a meeting of the Photographic\r\nSociety on a new printing process with collodio-chloride of silver on\r\npaper. Many beautiful examples were exhibited, but the method never\r\nbecame popular, chiefly on account of the troubles of toning with\r\nsulpho-cyanide of ammonium. The same or a similar process, substituting\r\ngelatine for collodion, is known and practised now under the name of\r\nAristotype, but not very extensively, because of the same defects and\r\ndifficulties attending the Simpsontype. Another new method of positive\r\nprinting was introduced this year by Mr. John M. Burgess, of Norwich,\r\nwhich he called \"Eburneum.\" It was not in reality a new mode of\r\nprinting, but an ingenious application of the collodion transfer, or\r\nstripping process. The back of the collodion positive print was coated\r\nwith a mixture of gelatine and oxide of zinc, and when dry stripped from\r\nthe glass. The finished picture resembled a print on very fine ivory,\r\nand possessed both delicate half-tones and brilliant shadows. I possess\r\nsome of them now, and they are as beautiful as they were at first, after\r\na lapse of nearly quarter of a century. It was a very troublesome and\r\ntedious process, and I don't think many people practised it. Certainly I\r\ndon't know any one that does so at the present time.\r\n\r\nThis was the year of the Dublin International Exhibition. I went to see\r\nit and report thereon, and my opinions and criticisms of the\r\nphotographic and other departments will be found and may be perused in\r\n\"Contributions to Photographic Literature.\" On the whole, it was a very\r\nexcellent exhibition, and I thoroughly enjoyed the trip.\r\n\r\nA new carbon process by M. Carey Lea was published this year. The\r\ningredients were similar to those employed by Swan and others, but\r\ndifferently handled. No pigment was mixed with the gelatine before\r\nexposure, but it was rubbed on after exposure and washing, and with care\r\nany colour or number of colours might be applied, and so produce a\r\npolychromatic picture, but I don't know any one that ever did so. I\r\nthink it could easily be applied to making photographic transfers to\r\nblocks for the use of wood engravers.\r\n\r\nDecember 5th, 1865, Mr. Walter Woodbury demonstrated and exhibited\r\nexamples of the beautiful mechanical process that bears his name to the\r\nmembers of the Photographic Society. The process was not entirely\r\nphotographic. The province of photography ceased on the production of\r\nthe gelatine relief. All that followed was strictly mechanical. It is\r\nsomewhat singular that a majority of the inventions and modifications of\r\nprocesses that were introduced this year related to carbon and\r\npermanency.\r\n\r\nThursday, January 11th, 1866, I read, at the South London Photographic\r\nSociety, a paper on \"Errors in Pictorial Backgrounds.\" As the paper, as\r\nwell as the discussion thereon, is published _in extenso_ in the\r\njournals of the period, it is not necessary for me to repeat it here,\r\nbut I may as well state briefly my reasons for reading the paper. At\r\nthat time pictorial backgrounds and crowded accessories were greatly in\r\nuse, and it was seldom, if ever, that the horizontal line of the painted\r\nbackground, and the horizontal line indicated by the position of the\r\ncamera, coincided. Consequently the photographic pictures obtained under\r\nsuch conditions invariably exhibited this incongruity, and it was with\r\nthe hope of removing these defects, or violations of art rules and\r\noptical laws, that I ventured to call attention to the subject and\r\nsuggest a remedy. A little later, I wrote an article, \"Notes on Pictures\r\nin the National Gallery,\" which was published in the _Photographic News_\r\nof March 29th, in support of the arguments already adduced in my paper\r\non \"Errors in Pictorial Backgrounds,\" and I recommend every portrait\r\nphotographer to study those pictures.\r\n\r\nFebruary 13th I was elected a member of the Photographic Society of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nQuite a sensation was created in the Spring of this year by the\r\nintroduction of what were termed \"Magic Photographs.\" Some one was\r\nimpudent enough to patent the process, although it was nothing but a\r\nresurrection of what was published in 1840 by Sir John Herschel, which\r\nconsisted of bleaching an ordinary silver print to invisibility with\r\nbichloride of mercury, and restoring it by an application of\r\nhyposulphite of soda. I introduced another form of magic photograph, in\r\nvarious monochromatic colours, similar to Sir John Herschel's\r\ncyanotype, and I have several of these pictures in my possession now,\r\nboth blue, purple, and red, dated 1866, as bright and beautiful as they\r\nwere the day they were made. But the demand for these magic photographs\r\nwas suddenly stopped by someone introducing indecent pictures. In all\r\nprobability these objectionable pictures came from abroad, and the most\r\nscrupulous of the home producers suffered in consequence, as none of the\r\npurchasers could possibly know what would appear when the developer or\r\nredeveloper was applied.\r\n\r\nOn June 14th Mr. F. W. Hart read a paper, and demonstrated before the\r\nSouth London Photographic Society, on his method of rendering silver\r\nprints permanent. \"A consummation devoutly to be wished,\" but\r\nunfortunately some prints in my possession that were treated to a bath\r\nof his eliminator show unmistakable signs of fading. In my opinion,\r\nthere is nothing so efficacious as warm water washing, and some prints\r\nthat I toned, fixed, and washed myself over thirty years ago, are\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nThe \"cabinet\" form of portrait was introduced this year by Mr. F. R.\r\nWindow, and it eventually became the fashionable size, and almost wiped\r\nout the carte-de-visite. The latter, however, had held its position for\r\nabout nine years, and the time for change had arrived. Beyond the\r\nintroduction of the cabinet portrait, nothing very novel or ingenious\r\nhad been introduced, but a very good review of photography up to date\r\nappeared in the October issue of the _British Quarterly Review_. This\r\nwas a very ably written article from the pen of my old friend, Mr.\r\nGeorge Wharton Simpson.\r\n\r\nNo radical improvement or advance in photography was made in 1867, but\r\nM. Adam-Salomon created a little sensation by exhibiting some very fine\r\nsamples of his work in the Paris Exhibition. They were remarkable\r\nchiefly for their pose, lighting, retouching, and tone. A few of them\r\nwere afterwards seen in London, and that of Dr. Diamond was probably the\r\nmost satisfactory. M. Salomon was a sculptor in Paris, and his art\r\ntraining and feeling in that branch of the Fine Arts naturally assisted\r\nhim in photography.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Luynes's prize of 8,000 francs for the best mechanical\r\nprinting process was this year awarded to M. Poitevin. In making the\r\naward, the Commission gave a very excellent resume of all that had\r\npreviously been done in that direction, and endeavoured to show why they\r\nthought M. Poitevin entitled to the prize; but for all that I think it\r\nwill be difficult to prove that any of M. Poitevin's mechanical\r\nprocesses ever came into use.\r\n\r\nOn June 13th, in the absence of Mr. Jabez Hughes, I read his paper,\r\n\"About Leptographic Printing,\" before the South London Photographic\r\nSociety. This Leptographic paper was claimed to be the invention of two\r\nphotographers in Madrid, but it was evidently only a modification of Mr.\r\nSimpson's collodio-chloride of silver process.\r\n\r\nAbout this period I got into a controversy--on very different subjects,\r\nit is true--but it made me determine to abandon for the future the\r\npractice of writing critical notices under the cover of a _nom de\r\nplume_. I had, under the _nom de plume_ of \"Union Jack,\" written in\r\nfavour of a union of _all_ the photographic societies then in London.\r\nThis brought Mr. A. H. Wall down on me, but that did not affect me very\r\nmuch, nor was I personally distressed about the other, but I thought it\r\nbest to abandon a dangerous practice. Under the _nom de plume_ of \"Lux\r\nGraphicus\" I had contributed a great many articles to the _Photographic\r\nNews_, and, in a review of the Society's exhibition, published Nov.\r\n22nd, 1867, I expressed an honest opinion on Mr. Robinson's picture\r\nentitled \"Sleep.\" It was not so favourable and flattering, perhaps, as\r\nhe would have liked, but it was an honest criticism, and written without\r\nany intention of giving pain or offence.\r\n\r\nThe close of this year was marked by a very sad catastrophe intimately\r\nassociated with photography, by the death of Mr. Mawson at\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne; he was killed by an explosion of nitro-glycerine.\r\nMr. Mawson, in conjunction with Mr. J. W. Swan, was one of the earliest\r\nand most successful manufacturers of collodion, and, as early as 1852, I\r\nmade negatives with that medium, though I did not employ collodion\r\nsolely until 1857, when I abandoned for ever the beautiful and\r\nfascinating Daguerreotype.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, December 27th, Antoine Jean Francois Claudet, F.R.S., &c.,\r\n&c., died suddenly in the 71st year of his age. He was one of the\r\nearliest workers and improvers of the Daguerreotype process in this\r\ncountry, and one of the last to relinquish its practice in London. Mr.\r\nClaudet bought a share of the English patent of Mr. Berry, the agent,\r\nwhile he was a partner in the firm of Claudet and Houghton in 1840, and\r\ncommenced business as a professional Daguerreotypist soon afterwards.\r\nBefore the introduction of bromine as an accelerator by Mr. Goddard, Mr.\r\nClaudet had discovered that chloride of iodine increased the\r\nsensitiveness of the Daguerreotype plate, and he read a paper on that\r\nsubject before the Royal Society in 1841. He was a member of the council\r\nof the Photographic Society for many years, and a copious contributor to\r\nits proceedings, as well as to photographic literature. In his\r\nintercourse with his _confreres_ he was always courteous, and when I\r\ncalled upon him in 1851 he received me most kindly, I met him again in\r\nGlasgow, and many times in London, and always considered him the best\r\nspecimen of a Frenchman I had ever met. Towards his clients he was firm,\r\nrespectful, and sometimes generous, as the following characteristic\r\nanecdote will show. He had taken a portrait of a child, which, for some\r\nreason or other, was not liked, and demurred at. He said, \"Ah! well, the\r\nmatter is easily settled. I'll keep the picture, and return your money\";\r\nand so he thought the case was ended; but by-and-by the picture was\r\nasked for, and he refused to give it up. Proceedings were taken to\r\ncompel him to surrender it, which he defended. In stating the case, the\r\ncounsel remarked that the child was dead. Mr. Claudet immediately\r\nstopped the counsel and the case by exclaiming, \"Ah! they did not tell\r\nme that before. Now, I make the parents a present of the portrait.\" I am\r\nhappy to say that I possess a good portrait of Mr. Claudet, taken in\r\nNovember, 1867, with his _Topaz lens_, 5/8-inch aperture. Strangely\r\nenough, Mr. Claudet's studio in Regent Street was seriously damaged by\r\nfire within a month of his death, and all his valuable Daguerreotypes,\r\nnegatives, pictures, and papers destroyed.\r\n\r\nOn April 9th, 1868, I exhibited, at the South London Photographic\r\nSociety, examples of nearly all the types of photography then known,\r\namongst them a Daguerreotype by Daguerre, many of which are now in the\r\nScience Department of the South Kensington Museum, and were presented by\r\nme to form the nucleus of a national exhibition of the rise and progress\r\nof photography, for which I received the \"thanks of the Lords of the\r\nCouncil on Education,\" dated April 22nd, 1886.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing very remarkable done in 1868 to forward the interests\r\nor development of photography, yet that year narrowly escaped being made\r\nmemorable, for Mr. W. H. Harrison, now editor of the _Photographic\r\nNews_, actually prepared, exposed, and developed a gelatino-bromide\r\ndry plate, but did not pursue the matter further. 1869 also passed\r\nwithout adding much to the advancement of photography, and I fear the\r\nsame may be said of 1870, with the exception of the publication, by\r\nThos. Sutton, of Gaudin's gelatino-iodide process.\r\n\r\nOn February 21st, 1870, Robert J. Bingham died in Brussels. When the\r\nDaguerreotype process was first introduced to this country, Mr. Bingham\r\nwas chemical assistant to Prof. Faraday at the Royal Institution. He\r\ntook an immediate interest in the wonderful discovery, and made an\r\nimprovement in the application of bromine vapour, which entitled him to\r\nthe gratitude of all Daguerreotypists. When Mr. Goddard applied bromine\r\nto the process, he employed \"bromine water,\" but, in very hot weather,\r\nthe aqueous vapour condensed upon the surface of the plate, and\r\ninterrupted the sensitising process. Mr. Bingham obviated this evil by\r\ncharging hydrate of lime with bromine vapour, which not only removed the\r\ntrouble of condensation, but increased the sensitiveness of the prepared\r\nplate. This was a great boon to all Daguerreotypists, and many a time I\r\nthanked him mentally long before I had the pleasure of meeting him in\r\nLondon. Mr. Bingham also wrote a valuable manual on the Daguerreotype\r\nand other photographic processes, which was published by Geo. Knight and\r\nSons, Foster Lane, Cheapside. Some years before his death, Mr. Bingham\r\nsettled in Paris, and became a professional photographer, but chiefly as\r\na publisher of photographic copies of paintings and drawings.\r\n\r\nAbel Niepce de St. Victor, best known without the Abel, died suddenly on\r\nApril 6th, 1870. Born at St. Cyr, July 26th, 1805. After passing through\r\nhis studies at the Military School of Saumur, he became an officer in a\r\ncavalry regiment. Being studious and fond of chemistry, he was fortunate\r\nenough to effect some saving to the Government in the dyeing of fabrics\r\nemployed in making certain military uniforms, for which he received\r\ncompensation and promotion. His photographic fame rests upon two\r\nachievements: firstly, his application of iodized albumen to glass for\r\nnegative purposes in 1848, a process considerably in advance of Talbot's\r\npaper negatives, but it was quickly superseded by collodion; secondly,\r\nhis researches on \"heliochromy,\" or photography in natural colours.\r\nNiepce de St. Victor, like others before and since, was only partially\r\nsuccessful in obtaining some colour reproductions, but totally\r\nunsuccessful in rendering those colours permanent. In proof of both\r\nthese statements I will quote from the Juror's Report, on the subject,\r\nof the International Exhibition, 1862:--\"The obtaining of fixed natural\r\ncolours by means of photography still remains, as was before remarked,\r\nto be accomplished; but the jurors have pleasure in recording that some\r\nvery striking results of experiments in this direction were forwarded\r\nfor their inspection by a veteran in photographic research and\r\ndiscovery, M. Niepce de St. Victor. These, about a dozen in number, 3-1/2\r\nby 2-1/2 inches, consisted of reproductions of prints of figures with\r\nparti-coloured draperies. Each tint in the pictures exhibited, they were\r\nassured, was a faithful reproduction of the original. Amongst the\r\ncolours were blues, yellows, reds, greens, &c., all very vivid. Some of\r\nthe tints gradually faded and disappeared in the light whilst under\r\nexamination, and a few remained permanent for some hours. The\r\npossibility of producing natural colour thus established is a fact most\r\ninteresting and important, and too much praise cannot be awarded to the\r\nskilful research which has been to this extent crowned with success. The\r\njury record their obligations to their chairman, Baron Gross, at whose\r\npersonal solicitation they were enabled to obtain a sight of these\r\nremarkable pictures.\" Such was the condition of photography in natural\r\ncolours towards the close of 1862, and so it is now after a lapse of\r\ntwenty-eight years. In 1870 several examples of Niepce de St. Victor's\r\nheliochromy were sent to the Photographic Society of London, and I had\r\nthem in my hands and examined them carefully in gas-light; they could\r\nnot be looked at in daylight at all. I certainly saw _faint_ traces of\r\ncolour, but whether I saw them in their original vigour, or after they\r\nhad faded, I cannot say. All I can say is that the tints were very\r\nfeeble, and that they had not been obtained _through the lens_. They\r\nwere, at their best, only contact impressions of coloured prints\r\nobtained after many hours of exposure. The examples had been sent to the\r\nPhotographic Society with the hope of selling them for the benefit of\r\nthe widow, but the Society was too wise to invest in such evanescent\r\nproperty. However, a subscription was raised both in England and France\r\nfor the benefit of the widow and orphans of Niepce de St. Victor.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1870, was marked by the death of one of the eminent pioneers\r\nof photography. On the 12th, the Rev. J. B. Reade passed away at\r\nBishopsbourne Rectory, Canterbury, in the sixty-ninth year of his age. I\r\nhave already, I think, established Mr. Reade's claim to the honour of\r\nbeing the first to produce a photographic negative on paper developed\r\nwith gallic acid, and I regret that I am unable to trace the existence\r\nof those two negatives alluded to in Mr. Reade's published letter. Mr.\r\nReade told me himself that he gave those two historic negatives to Dr.\r\nDiamond, when Secretary to the Photographic Society, to be lodged with\r\nthat body for safety, proof, and reference; but they are not now in the\r\npossession of the Photographic Society, and what became of them no one\r\nknows. Several years ago I caused enquiries to be made, and Dr. Diamond\r\nwas written to by Mr. H. Baden Pritchard, then Secretary, but Dr.\r\nDiamond's reply was to the effect that he had no recollection of them,\r\nand that Mr. Reade was given to hallucinations. Considering the\r\npositions that Mr. Reade held, both in the world and various learned and\r\nscientific societies, I don't think that he could ever have been\r\nafflicted with such a mental weakness. He was a clergyman in the Church\r\nof England, an amateur astronomer and microscopist, one of the fathers\r\nof photography, and a member of Council of the Photographic Society, and\r\nPresident of the Microscopical Society at the time of his death. I had\r\nmany a conversation with him years ago, and I never detected either\r\nweakness or wandering in his mind; therefore I could not doubt the truth\r\nof his statement relative to the custodianship of the first paper\r\nnegative that was taken through the lens of a solar microscope. Mr.\r\nReade was a kind and affable man; and, though a great sufferer on his\r\nlast bed of sickness, he wrote loving, grateful, and Christian like\r\nletters to many of his friends, some of which I have seen, and I have\r\nphotographed his signature to one of them to attach to his portrait,\r\nwhich I happily possess.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the coming revolution in photography was faintly heralded by Dr.\r\nR. L. Maddox, publishing in the _British Journal of Photography_, \"An\r\nExperiment with Gelatino-Bromide.\" Successful as the experiment was it\r\ndid not lead to any extensive adoption of the process at the time, but\r\nit did most unquestionably exhibit the capabilities of gelatino-bromide.\r\n\r\nAs that communication to the _British Journal of Photography_ contained\r\nand first made public the working details of a process that was destined\r\nto supersede collodion, I will here insert a copy of Dr. Maddox's letter\r\n_in extenso_.\r\n\r\n\"An Experiment with Gelatino-Bromide.\r\n\r\n\"The collodio-bromide processes have for some time held a considerable\r\nplace in the pages of the _British Journal of Photography_, and obtained\r\nsuch a prominent chance of being eventually the process of the day in\r\nthe dry way, that a few remarks upon the application of another medium\r\nmay perhaps not be uninteresting to the readers of the journal, though\r\nlittle more can be stated than the result of somewhat careless\r\nexperiments tried at first on an exceedingly dull afternoon. It is not\r\nfor a moment supposed to be new, for the chances of novelty in\r\nphotography are small, seeing the legion of ardent workers, and the\r\nground already trodden by its devotees, so that for outsiders little\r\nremains except to take the result of labours so industriously and\r\nlargely circulated through these pages, and be thankful.\r\n\r\n\"Gelatine, which forms the medium of so many printing processes, and\r\nwhich doubtless is yet to form the base of many more, was tried in the\r\nplace of collodion in this manner:--Thirty grains of Nelson's gelatine\r\nwere washed in cold water, then left to swell for several hours, when\r\nall the water was poured off, and the gelatine set in a wide-mouthed\r\nbottle, with the addition of four drachms of pure water, and two small\r\ndrops of _aqua regia_, and then placed in a basin of hot water for\r\nsolution. Eight grains of bromide of cadmium dissolved in half a drachm\r\nof pure water were now added, and the solution stirred gently. Fifteen\r\ngrains of nitrate of silver were next dissolved in half a drachm of\r\nwater in a test tube, and the whole taken into the dark room, when the\r\nlatter was added to the former slowly, stirring the mixture the whole\r\ntime. This gave a fine milky emulsion, and was left for a little while\r\nto settle. A few plates of glass well cleaned were next levelled on a\r\nmetal plate put over a small lamp; they were, when fully warmed, coated\r\nby the emulsion spread to the edges by a glass rod, then returned to\r\ntheir places, and left to dry. When dry, the plates had a thin\r\nopalescent appearance, and the deposit of bromide seemed to be very\r\nevenly spread in the substance of the substratum.\r\n\r\n\"These plates were printed from, in succession, from different\r\nnegatives, one of which had been taken years since on albumen with\r\noxgall and diluted phosphoric acid, sensitised in an acid nitrate, and\r\ndeveloped with pyrogallic acid, furnishing a beautiful warm brown tint.\r\n\r\n\"The exposure varied from the first plate thirty seconds to a minute and\r\na half, as the light was very poor. No vestige of an outline appeared on\r\nremoval from the printing-frame. The plates were dipped in water to the\r\nsurface, and over them was poured a plain solution of pyrogallic acid,\r\nfour grains to the ounce of water. Soon a faint but clean image was\r\nseen, which gradually intensified up to a certain point, then browned\r\nall over; hence, the development in the others was stopped at an early\r\nstage, the plate washed, and the development continued with fresh pyro,\r\nwith one drop of a ten-grain solution of nitrate of silver, then\r\nre-washed and cleared by a solution of hyposulphite of soda.\r\n\r\n\"The resulting tints were very delicate in detail, of a colour varying\r\nbetween a bistre and olive tint, and after washing dried with a\r\nbrilliant surface. The colour of the print varied greatly according to\r\nthe exposure. From the colour and delicacy it struck me that with care\r\nto strain the gelatine, or use only the clearest portion, such a process\r\nmight be utilised for transparencies for the lantern, and the sensitive\r\nplates be readily prepared.\r\n\r\n\"Some plates were fumed with ammonia; these fogged under the pyro\r\nsolution. The proportions set down were only taken at random, and are\r\ncertainly not as sensitive as might be procured under trials. The\r\nremaining emulsion was left shut up in a box in the dark room, and tried\r\non the third day after preparation; but the sensibility had, it seems,\r\ngreatly diminished, though the emulsion, when rendered fluid by gently\r\nwarming, appeared creamy, and the bromide thoroughly suspended. Some of\r\nthis was now applied to some pieces of paper by means of a glass rod,\r\nand hung up to surface dry, then dried fully on the warmed level plate,\r\nand treated as sensitised paper.\r\n\r\n\"One kind of paper, that evidently was largely adulterated by some earthy\r\nbase, dried without any brilliancy, but gave, under exposure of a\r\nnegative for thirty seconds, very nicely toned prints when developed\r\nwith a weak solution of pyro. Some old albumenized paper of Marion's was\r\ntried, the emulsion being poured both on the albumen side, and, in other\r\npieces, on the plain side; but the salting evidently greatly interfered,\r\nthe resulting prints being dirty-looking and greyed all over.\r\n\r\n\"These papers, fumed with ammonia, turned grey under development. They\r\nprinted very slowly, even in strong sunlight, and were none of them left\r\nlong enough to develop into a full print. After washing they were\r\ncleared by weak hypo solution. It is very possible the iron developer\r\nmay be employed for the glass prints, provided the acidification does\r\nnot render the gelatine soft under a development.\r\n\r\n\"The slowness may depend in part on the proportions of bromide and\r\nnitrate not being correctly balanced, especially as the ordinary, not\r\nthe anhydrous, bromide was used, and on the quantities being too small\r\nfor the proportion of gelatine. Whether the plates would be more\r\nsensitive if used when only surface dry is a question of experiment;\r\nalso, whether other bromides than the one tried may not prove more\r\nadvantageous in the presence of the neutral salt resulting from the\r\ndecomposition, or the omission or decrease of the quantity of _aqua\r\nregia_. Very probably also the development by gallic acid and acetate of\r\nlead developer may furnish better results than the plain pyro.\r\n\r\n\"As there will be no chance of my being able to continue these\r\nexperiments, they are placed in their crude state before the readers of\r\nthe Journal, and may eventually receive correction and improvement under\r\nabler hands. So far as can be judged, the process seems quite worth more\r\ncarefully conducted experiments, and, if found advantageous, adds\r\nanother handle to the photographer's wheel.\r\n\r\nR. L. Maddox, M.D.\"\r\n\r\nAfter perusing the above, it will be evident to any one that Dr. Maddox\r\nvery nearly arrived at perfection in his early experiments. The slowness\r\nthat he complains of was caused entirely by not washing the emulsion to\r\ndischarge the excess of bromide, and the want of density was due to the\r\nabsence of a restrainer and ammonia in the developer. He only made\r\npositive prints from negatives; but the same emulsion, had it been\r\nwashed, would have made negatives in the camera in much less time. Thus,\r\nit will be seen, that Dr. Maddox, like the Rev. J. B. Reade, threw the\r\nball, and others caught it; for the gelatine process, as given by Dr.\r\nMaddox, is only modified, not altered, by the numerous dry plate and\r\ngelatino-bromide paper manufacturers of to-day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile collodion held the field, and many practical men thought it\r\nwould never be superseded.\r\n\r\nIn this year Sir John Herschel died at a ripe old age, seventy-nine.\r\nPhotographers should revere his memory, for it was he who made\r\nphotography practical by publishing his observation that hyposulphite of\r\nsoda possessed the power of dissolving chloride and other salts of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FOURTH PERIOD.\r\n  GELATINE.\r\n\r\n  Dr. R. L. MADDOX.\r\n  _From Photograph by J. Thomson._\r\n  GELATINO-BROMIDE EMULSION 1871.\r\n\r\n  R. KENNETT.\r\n  _From Photograph by J. Werge, 1887._\r\n  GELATINO-BROMIDE PELLICLE 1873 DRY-PLATES 1874]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH PERIOD.\r\n\r\nGELATINE SUCCESSFUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1873, Mr. J. Burgess, of Peckham, London, advertised his\r\ngelatino-bromide emulsion, but as it would not keep in consequence of\r\ndecomposition setting in speedily, it was not commercial, and therefore\r\nunsuccessful. It evidently required the addition of some preservative,\r\nor antiseptic, to keep it in a workable condition, and Mr. J. Traill\r\nTaylor, editor of the _British Journal of Photography_, made some\r\nexperiments in that direction by adding various essential oils; but Mr.\r\nGray--afterwards the well-known dry plate maker--was most successful in\r\npreserving the gelatine emulsion from decomposition by the addition of a\r\nlittle oil of peppermint, but it was not the emulsion form of\r\ngelatino-bromide of silver that was destined to secure its universal\r\nadoption and success.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the South London Photographic Society, held in the large\r\nroom of the Society of Arts, John Street, Adelphi, Mr. Burgess\r\nendeavoured to account for his emulsion decomposing, but he did not\r\nsuggest a remedy, so the process ceased to attract further attention.\r\nMr. Kennett was present, and it was probably Mr. Burgess's failure with\r\nemulsion that induced him to make his experiments with a sensitive\r\npellicle. Be that as it may, Mr. Kennett did succeed in making a\r\nworkable gelatino-bromide pellicle, and obtained a patent for it on the\r\n20th of November, 1873. I procured some, and tried it at once. It gave\r\nexcellent results, but preparing the plates was a messy and sticky\r\noperation, which I feared would be prejudicial to its usefulness and\r\nsuccess. This I reported to Mr. Kennett immediately, and found that\r\nhis own experience corroborated mine, for he had already received\r\nnumerous complaints of this objection, while others failed through\r\nmisapprehension of his instruction; and very comical were some of these\r\nmisinterpretations. One attempted to coat the plates with the _end_ of\r\nthe stirring-rod, while another set them to drain in a rack, and those\r\nthat did succeed in coating the plates properly, invariably spoiled\r\nthem by over-exposure or in development. He was overwhelmed with\r\ncorrespondence and visitors, and to lessen his troubles I strongly\r\nadvised him to prepare the plates himself, and sell them in that form\r\nready for use. He took my advice, and in March, 1874, issued his first\r\nbatch of gelatino-bromide dry plates; but even that did not remove his\r\nvexation of spirit, nor lessen his troublesome correspondence. Most of\r\nhis clients were sceptical, and exposed the plates too long, or worked\r\nunder wet-plate conditions in their dark rooms, and fog and failure were\r\nthe natural consequences. Most, if not all, of his clients at that time\r\nwere amateurs, and it was not until years after, that professional\r\nphotographers adopted the dry and abandoned the wet process. In fact, it\r\nis doubtful if the profession ever tried Mr. Kennett's dry plates at\r\nall, for it was not until J. W. Swan and Wratten and Wainwright issued\r\ntheir dry plates, that I could induce any professional photographer to\r\ngive these new plates a trial, and I have a very vivid recollection\r\nof the scepticism and conservatism exhibited by the most eminent\r\nphotographers on the first introduction of gelatino-bromide dry plates.\r\n\r\nFor example, when I called upon Messrs. Elliott and Fry to introduce to\r\ntheir notice these rapid plates, I saw Mr. Fry, and told him how rapid\r\nthey were. He was incredulous, and smilingly informed me that I was an\r\nenthusiast. It was a dull November morning, 1878, and I challenged him,\r\nnot to fight, but to give me an opportunity of producing as good a\r\npicture in quarter the time they were giving in the studio, no matter\r\nwhat that time was. This rather astonished him, and he invited me up to\r\nthe studio to prove my statement. I ascertained that they were giving\r\n_ninety_ seconds--a minute and a half!--on a wet collodion plate, 10 by\r\n8. I knew their size, and had it with me, as well as the developer. Mr.\r\nFry stood and told the operator, Mr. Benares, to take the time from me.\r\nLooking at the quality of the light, I gave _twenty_ seconds, but Mr.\r\nBenares was disposed to be incredulous also, and, after counting twenty,\r\nwent on with \"one for the plate, and one more for Mr. Werge,\" but I told\r\nhim to stop, or I would have nothing more to do with the business. The\r\nplate had twenty-two or three seconds' exposure, and when I developed in\r\ntheir dark room, it was just those two or three seconds over-exposed.\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Fry brought me a print from that negative in a few\r\ndays, and acknowledged that it was one of the finest negatives he had\r\never seen. They were convinced, and adopted the new dry plates\r\nimmediately. But it was not so with all, for many of the most prominent\r\nphotographers would not at first have anything to do with gelatine\r\nplates, and remained quite satisfied with collodion; but the time came\r\nwhen they were glad to change their opinion, and give up the wet for\r\nthe dry plates; but it was a long time, for Mr. Kennett introduced his\r\ndry plates in 1874, and it was not until 1879 and 1880 that professional\r\nphotographers had adopted and taken kindly to gelatine plates generally.\r\n\r\nWith amateurs it was very different, and many of their exhibits in the\r\nvarious exhibitions were from gelatine negatives obtained upon plates\r\nprepared by themselves, or commercial makers. In the London Photographic\r\nSociety's exhibition of 1874, and following, several prints from\r\ngelatine negatives were exhibited, and in 1879 they were pretty general.\r\nAmong the many exhibited that year was Mr. Gale's swallow-picture,\r\nwhich created at the time a great deal of interest and controversy, and\r\nMr. Gale was invited over and over again to acknowledge whether the\r\nappearance of the bird was the result of skill, accident, or \"trickery;\"\r\nbut I don't think that he ever gratified anyone's curiosity on the\r\nsubject. I can, however, state very confidently that he was innocent of\r\nany \"trickery\" in introducing the bird by double printing, for the late\r\nMr. Dudley Radcliffe told me at the time that he (Mr. Radcliffe) not\r\nonly prepared the plate, but developed the negative, and was surprised\r\nto see the bird there. This may have been the reason why Mr. Gale was so\r\nreticent on the subject; but I am anticipating, and must go back to\r\npreserve my plan of chronological progression.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 a considerable impetus was given to carbon printing, both for\r\nsmall work and enlarging by the introduction of the Lambertype process.\r\nSimilar work had been done before, but, as Mr. Leon Lambert used to say,\r\nhe made it \"facile\"; and he certainly did so, and induced many\r\nphotographers to adopt his beautiful, but troublesome, chromotype\r\nprocess. There were two Lamberts in the tent--one a very clever\r\nmanipulator, the other a clever advertiser--and between the two they\r\nmanaged to sell a great many licences, and carry away a considerable sum\r\nof money. I was intimate with them both while they remained in England,\r\nand they were both pleasant and honourable men.\r\n\r\nOn January 18th, 1875, O. G. Rejlander died, much to the regret of all\r\nwho took an interest in the art phase of photography. Rejlander has\r\nhimself told us how, when, and where he first fell in love with\r\nphotography. In 1851 he was not impressed with the Daguerreotypes at the\r\ngreat exhibition, nor with \"reddish landscape photographs\" that he saw\r\nin Regent Street; but when in Rome, in 1852, he was struck with the\r\nbeauty of some photographs of statuary, which he bought and studied,\r\nand made up his mind to study photography as soon as he returned to\r\nEngland. How he did that will be best told by himself:--\"In 1853, having\r\ninquired in London for the best teacher, I was directed to Henneman. We\r\nagreed for so much for three or five lessons; but, as I was in a hurry\r\nto get back to the country, I took all the lessons in one afternoon!\r\nThree hours in the calotype and waxed-paper process, and half-an-hour\r\nsufficed for the collodion process!! He spoke, I wrote; but I was too\r\nclever. It would have saved me a year or more of trouble and expense had\r\nI attended carefully to the rudiments of the art for a month.\" His first\r\nattempt at \"double printing\" was exhibited in London in 1855, and was\r\nnamed in the catalogue, _group printed from three negatives_. Again, I\r\nmust allow Mr. Rejlander to describe his reasons for persevering in the\r\nart of \"double printing\":--\"I had taken a group of two. They were\r\nexpressive and composed well. The light was good, and the chemistry of\r\nit successful. A very good artist was staying in the neighbourhood,\r\nengaged on some commission. He called; saw the picture; was very much\r\ndelighted with it, and so was I. Before he left my house he looked at\r\nthe picture again, and said it was 'marvellous,' but added, 'Now, if I\r\nhad drawn that, I should have introduced another figure between them, or\r\nsome light object, to keep them together. You see, there is where you\r\nphotographers are at fault. Good morning!' I snapped my fingers after he\r\nleft--but not at him--and exclaimed aloud, 'I can do it!' Two days\r\nafterwards I called at my artist-friend's hotel as proud as--anybody. He\r\nlooked at my picture and at me, and took snuff twice. He said, 'This is\r\nanother picture.' 'No,' said I, 'it is the same, except with the\r\naddition you suggested.' 'Never,' he exclaimed; 'and how is it possible?\r\nYou should patent that!'\" Rejlander was too much of an artist to take\r\nanything to the Patent Office.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw his celebrated composition picture, \"The Two Ways of\r\nLife,\" in the Art Treasures Exhibition at Manchester in 1857, I\r\nwondered how he could have got so many men and women to become models,\r\nand be able to sit or stand in such varied and strained positions for\r\nthe length of time then required by the wet collodion process; but my\r\nwonder ceased when I became acquainted with him in after years, and\r\nascertained that he had the command of a celebrated troupe, who gave\r\n_tableaux vivants_ representations of statues and groups from paintings\r\nunder the direction and name of \"Madame Wharton's _pose plastique_\r\ntroupe.\" What became of the original \"Two Ways of Life\" I do not know,\r\nbut the late Henry Greenwood possessed it at the time of Rejlander's\r\ndeath, for I remember endeavouring to induce Mr. Greenwood to allow it\r\nto be offered as a bait to the highest contributor to the Rejlander\r\nfund; but Mr. Greenwood's characteristic reply was, \"Take my purse, but\r\nleave me my 'Two Ways of Life.'\" Mr. Rejlander kindly gave me a reduced\r\ncopy of his \"Two Ways of Life,\" and many other examples of his works,\r\nboth in the nude and semi-nude. Fortunately Rejlander did not confine\r\nhimself to such productions, but made hundreds of draped studies, both\r\ncomic and serious, such as \"Ginx's Baby,\" \"Did She?,\" \"Beyond the Bible,\"\r\nand \"Homeless.\" Where are they all now? I fear most of them have faded\r\naway, for Rejlander was a somewhat careless operator, and he died before\r\nthe more permanent process of platinum printing was introduced. When\r\nRejlander died, his widow tried to make a living by printing from his\r\nnegatives, but I fear they soon got scattered. Rejlander was a genial\r\nsoul and a pleasant companion, and he had many kind friends among\r\nmembers of the Solar Club, as well as other clubs with which he was\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\nThere is one more death in this year to be recorded, that of Thomas\r\nSutton, B.A., the founder and for many years editor of _Photographic\r\nNotes_, and the inventor of a panoramic camera of a very clumsy\r\ncharacter that bore his name, and that was all. Mr. Sutton was a very\r\nclever man with rather warped notions, and in the management of his\r\n_Photographic Notes_ he descended to the undignified position of a\r\ncaricaturist, and published illustrations of an uncomplimentary\r\ndescription, some of which were offensive in the extreme, and created a\r\ngreat deal of irritation in some minds at the time.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Carey Lea gave his ferrous-oxalate developer to the world, but\r\nit was not welcomed by many English photographers for negative\r\ndevelopment, though it possessed many advantages over alkaline pyro. It\r\nwas, however, generally employed by foreign photographers, and is now\r\nlargely in use by English photographers, especially for the development\r\nof bromide paper, either for contact printing or enlargements. In the\r\nearly part of this year, Messrs. Wratten and Wainwright commenced to\r\nmake gelatino-bromide dry plates, and during the hot summer months Mr.\r\nWratten found it necessary to precipitate the gelatine emulsion with\r\nalcohol. This removed the necessity of dialysing, and helped to lessen\r\nthe evils of decomposition and \"frilling.\"\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable death in the photographic world of this year was\r\nthat of Henry Fox Talbot. He was born on February the 11th, 1800, and\r\ndied September 17th, 1877, thus attaining a ripe old age. I am not\r\ndisposed to deny his claims to the honour of doing a great deal to\r\nforward the advancement of photography, but what strikes me very much is\r\nthe mercenary spirit in which he did it, especially when I consider the\r\nposition he occupied, and the pecuniary means at his command. In the\r\nfirst place, he rushed to the Patent Office with his gallo-nitrate\r\ndeveloper, and then every little improvement or modification that he\r\nafterwards made was carefully protected by patent rights. With a\r\nchurlishness of spirit and narrow-mindedness it is almost impossible to\r\nconceive or forgive, he tried his utmost to stop the formation of the\r\nLondon Photographic Society, and it was only after pressing\r\nsolicitations from Sir Charles Eastlake, President of the Royal Academy,\r\nand first President of the London Photographic Society, that he\r\nwithdrew his objections. The late Peter le Neve Foster, Secretary of the\r\nSociety of Arts, told me this years after, and when it was proposed to\r\nmake Fox Talbot an honorary member of the Photographic Society, Mr.\r\nFoster was opposed to the proposition. Then the action that he brought\r\nagainst Sylvester Laroche was unjustifiable, for there really was no\r\nresemblance between the collodion and calotype means of making a\r\nnegative, except in the common use of the camera, and the means of\r\nmaking prints was the same as that employed by Thomas Wedgwood, while\r\nthe fixing process with hyposulphite of soda was first resorted to by\r\nthe Rev. J. B. Reade, on the published information of Sir John Herschel.\r\n\r\nOn March 29th, 1878, Mr. Charles Bennett published his method of\r\nincreasing the sensitiveness of gelatino-bromide plates. It may be\r\nbriefly described as a prolonged cooking of the gelatine emulsion at a\r\ntemperature of 90 deg., and, according to Mr. Bennett's experience, the\r\nlonger it was cooked the more sensitive it became, with a corresponding\r\nreduction of density when the prepared plates were exposed and\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nApril 20th of this year Mr. J. A. Spencer died, after a lingering\r\nillness, of cancer in the throat. Mr. Spencer was, at one period in the\r\nhistory of photography, the largest manufacturer of albumenized paper in\r\nthis country, and carried on his business at Shepherd's Bush. In 1866 he\r\ntold me that he broke about 2,000 eggs daily, merely to obtain the\r\nwhites or albumen. The yolks being of no use to him, he sold them, when\r\nhe could, to glove makers, leather dressers, and confectioners, but they\r\ncould not consume all he offered for sale, and he buried the rest in his\r\ngarden until his neighbours complained of the nuisance, so that it\r\nbecame ultimately a very difficult thing for him to dispose of his waste\r\nyolks in any manner. After the introduction of Swan's improved carbon\r\nprocess, he turned his attention to the manufacture of carbon tissue,\r\nand in a short time he became one of the partners in the Autotype\r\nCompany, and the name of the firm at that period was Spencer, Sawyer,\r\nand Bird; but he ceased to be a partner some time before his death.\r\n\r\nAt the South London Technical Meeting, held in the great hall of the\r\nSociety of Arts, I exhibited my non-actinic developing tray, and\r\ndeveloped a gelatine dry plate in the full blaze of gas-light. A short\r\nextract from a leader in the _Photographic News_ of November 14th, 1879,\r\nwill be sufficient to satisfy all who are interested in the matter.\r\n\"Amongst the many ingenious appliances exhibited at the recent South\r\nLondon meeting, none excited greater interest than the developing tray\r\nof Mr. Werge, in which he developed in the full gas-light of the room a\r\ngelatine plate which had been exposed in the morning, and exhibited to\r\nthe meeting the result in a clean transparency, without fog, or any\r\ntrace of the abnormal action of light.... We can here simply record the\r\nfact, interesting to many, that the demonstration before the South\r\nLondon meeting was a perfect success.\"\r\n\r\n1880 had a rather melancholy beginning, for on January the 15th, Mr.\r\nGeorge Wharton Simpson died suddenly, which was a great shock to every\r\none that knew him. I had seen him only a few days before in his usual\r\ngood health, and he looked far more like outliving me than I him;\r\nbesides, he was a year my junior. The extract above quoted was the last\r\ntime he honoured me by mentioning my name in his writings, though he had\r\ndone so many times before, both pleasantly and in defending me against\r\nsome ill-natured and unwarrantable attacks in the journal which he so\r\nably conducted for twenty years.\r\n\r\nMungo Ponton died August 3rd, 1880. Though his discovery did little or\r\nnothing towards the development of photography proper, it is impossible\r\nto allow him to pass out of this world without honourable mention, for\r\nhis discovery led to the creation and development of numerous and\r\nimportant photo-mechanical industries, which give employment to numbers\r\nof men and women. When Mungo Ponton announced his discovery in the\r\n_Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal_ in 1839, he probably never dreamt\r\nthat it would be of any commercial value, or he might have secured\r\nrights and royalties on all the patent processes that grew out of it;\r\nfor Poitevin's patent, 1855, Beauregard's, 1857, Pouncy's, 1858 and\r\n1863, J. W. Swan's, 1864, Woodbury's, 1866, all the Autotype and\r\nLambertype and kindred patents, as well as all the forms of Collotype\r\nprinting, are based on Ponton's discovery. But so it is: the originator\r\nof anything seldom seeks any advantage beyond the honour attached to the\r\nmaking of a great invention or discovery. It is generally the petty\r\nimprovers that rush to the Patent Office to secure rights and\r\nemoluments, regardless of the claims of the founders of their patented\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nOn March 2nd, 1880, I delivered a lecture on \"The Origin, Progress, and\r\nPractice of Photography\" before the Lewisham and Blackheath Scientific\r\nAssociation, in which I reviewed the development of photography from its\r\nearliest inception up to date, exhibited examples, and gave\r\ndemonstrations before a very attentive and apparently gratified\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th May, 1880, Professor Alfred Swaine Taylor died at his\r\nresidence, 15, St. James's Terrace, Regent's Park, in his seventy-fourth\r\nyear. He was born on the 11th December, 1806, at Northfleet in Kent, and\r\nin 1823 he entered as a student the united hospitals of Guy's and St.\r\nThomas's, and became the pupil of Sir Astley Cooper and Mr. Joseph Henry\r\nGreen. His success as a student and eminence as a professor, lecturer,\r\nand author are too well-known to require any comment from me on those\r\nsubjects, but it is not so generally known how much photography was\r\nindebted to him at the earliest period of its birth. In 1838 Dr. Taylor\r\npublished his celebrated work, \"The Elements of Medical Jurisprudence,\"\r\nand in 1840 he published a pamphlet \"On the Art of Photogenic Drawing,\"\r\nin which he advocated the superiority of ammonia nitrate of silver over\r\nchloride of silver as a sensitiser, and hyposulphite of lime over\r\nhyposulphite of soda as a fixer, and the latter he advocated up to the\r\nyear of his death, as the following letter will show:--\r\n\r\n\"_St. James's Terrace, February 10th, 1880._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Werge.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,--I have great pleasure in sending you for the purpose of your\r\nlecture some of my now ancient photographs. They show the early\r\nstruggles which we had to make. The mounted drawings were all made with\r\nthe _ammonia nitrate_ of silver; I send samples of the paper used. In\r\ngeneral the paper selected contained chloride enough to form ammonia\r\nchloride. I send samples of unused paper, procured in 1839--some salted\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\"All these drawings (which are dated) have been preserved by the\r\nhyposulphite of _lime_ (not soda). The hypo of lime does not form a\r\ndefinite compound with silver, like soda; hence it is easily washed\r\naway, and this is why the drawings are tolerably preserved after forty\r\nyears. All are on plain paper. Ammonia nitrate does not answer well on\r\nalbumenized paper. The art of toning by gold was not known in those\r\nancient days, but the faded drawings on _plain paper_, as you will see,\r\nadmit of restoration, in dark purple, by placing them in a very dilute\r\nsolution of chloride of gold, and putting them in the dark for\r\ntwenty-four hours. The gold replaces the reduced silver and sulphide of\r\nsilver. I send you the only copy I have of my photogenic drawing. Five\r\nhundred were printed, and all were sold or given away. Please take care\r\nof it. The loose photographs in red tape are scenes in Egypt and Greece,\r\ntaken about 1850 from wax-paper negatives (camera views) made by Mr. D.\r\nColnaghi, now English Consul at Florence. If you can call here I shall\r\nbe glad to say more to you on the matter.--Yours truly,\r\n\r\n\"Alfred S. Taylor.\"\r\n\r\nThe above was the last of many letters on photographic matters that I\r\nhad received from Dr. Taylor, and the last time I had the pleasure of\r\nseeing him was when I returned the photographs and pamphlet alluded to\r\ntherein, only a short time before his death. Dr. Taylor never lost his\r\ninterest in photography, and was always both willing and pleased to\r\nenter into conversation on the subject. He had worked at photography\r\nthrough all its changes, despite his many professional engagements, from\r\nits dawn in 1839, right up to the introduction of gelatino-bromide\r\ndry plates, and in 1879 he came and sat to me for his portrait on one\r\nof what he called \"these wonderful dry plates,\" and watched the process\r\nof development with as much interest as any enthusiastic tyro would have\r\ndone, and I am proud to say that I had the pleasure of taking the\r\nportrait and exhibiting the process of development of the latest aspect\r\nof photography to one of its most enthusiastic and talented pioneers.\r\n\r\nDr. Taylor was a man of remarkable energy and versatility. He was a\r\nprolific writer and an admirable artist. On his walls were numerous\r\nbeautiful drawings, and his windows were filled with charmingly illusive\r\ntransparencies, all the work of his own hands; and once, when expressing\r\nmy wonder that he could find time to do so many things, he remarked that\r\n\"a man could always find time to do anything he wished if his heart was\r\nwith his work.\" Doubtless it is so, and his life and what he did in it\r\nwere proofs of the truth and wisdom of his observation.\r\n\r\nHydroquinone as a developer was introduced this year by Eder and Toth,\r\nbut it did not make much progress at first. It is more in use now, but I\r\ndo not consider it equal to oxalate of iron.\r\n\r\nA considerable fillip was, this year, given to printing on\r\ngelatino-bromide paper by the issue of \"The Argentic Gelatino-Bromide\r\nWorker's Guide,\" published by W. T. Morgan and Co. The work was written\r\nby John Burgess, who made and sold a bromide emulsion some years\r\nbefore, and it contained some excellent working instructions. In the\r\nbook is a modification and simplification of J. M. Burgess's Eburneum\r\nProcess, though that process was the invention of Mr. J. Burgess, of\r\nNorwich; but a recent application of the gelatino-bromide emulsion to\r\ncelluloid slabs by Mr. Fitch has made the Ivorytype process as simple\r\nand certain as the exposure and development of gelatino-bromide paper.\r\n\r\nOn January 30th, 1881, died Mr. J. R. Johnson, of pantascopic celebrity.\r\nMr. Johnson was the inventor of many useful things, both photographic\r\nand otherwise. He was the chief promoter of the Autotype Company, in\r\nwhich the late Mr. Winsor was so deeply interested; and his double\r\ntransfer process, published in 1869, contributed greatly to the\r\nsuccessful development and practice of the Carbon process. The invention\r\nof the Pantascopic Camera, and what he did to forward the formation of\r\nthe Autotype Company and simplify carbon printing, may be considered the\r\nsum total of his claim to photographic recognition.\r\n\r\nThe chief photographic novelty of 1881 was Mr. Woodbury's Stannotype\r\nprocess, a modification and simplification of what is best known as the\r\nWoodburytype. Instead of forcing the gelatine relief into a block of\r\ntype-metal by immense pressure to make the matrix, he \"faced\" a reversed\r\nrelief with tin-foil, thus obtaining a printing matrix in less time and\r\nat less expense. I have seen some very beautiful examples of this\r\nprocess, but somehow or other it is not much employed.\r\n\r\nThe man who unquestionably made the first photographic portrait died on\r\nthe 4th of January, 1882, and I think it is impossible for me to notice\r\nthat event without giving a brief description of the circumstance, even\r\nthough I incur the risk of telling to some of my readers a tale twice\r\ntold. When Daguerre's success was first announced in the Academy of\r\nScience in 1839, M. Arago stated that Daguerre had not yet succeeded in\r\ntaking portraits, but that he hoped to do so soon. The details of the\r\nprocess were not published until July, and in the autumn of that year\r\nDr. Draper succeeded in obtaining a portrait of his assistant, and that\r\nwas the first likeness of a human being ever known to have been secured\r\nby photography. It would be interesting to know if that Daguerreotype is\r\nin existence now. Dr. Draper was Professor of Chemistry in the\r\nUniversity of New York, and as soon as the news of the discovery reached\r\nNew York he fitted an ordinary spectacle lens into a cigar case, and\r\ncommenced his experiments first by taking views out of a window, and\r\nafterwards by taking portraits. To shorten the time of exposure for the\r\nlatter, he whitened the faces of his sitters. In April, 1840, Dr. Draper\r\nand Professor Morse opened a portrait gallery on the top of the\r\nUniversity Buildings, New York, and did a splendid business among the\r\nvery best people of the City at the minimum price of five dollars a\r\nportrait, and they would be very small even at that price.\r\n\r\nOne more of the early workers in photography died this year on the 4th\r\nof March. Louis Alphonse Poitevin was not a father of photography in a\r\ncreative sense, but, like Walter Woodbury, an appropriater of\r\nphotography in furthering the development of photo-mechanical printing.\r\nHis first effort in that direction was to obtain copper plates, or\r\nmoulds, from Daguerreotype pictures by the aid of electrical deposits,\r\nand he discovered a method of photo-chemical engraving, for which he was\r\nawarded a silver medal by the Societe d'Encouragement des Arts, but the\r\nprocess was of no practical value. His chief and most valuable\r\nexperiments were with gelatine and bichromates, and his labours in that\r\ndirection were rewarded by the receipt of a considerable portion of the\r\nDuc de Luynes's prize for permanent photographic printing processes,\r\nwhich consisted of photo-lithography and Collotype printing. Born in\r\n1819, he was sixty-three years old when he died.\r\n\r\nA useful addition to the pyrogallic acid developer was this year given\r\nby Mr. Herbert B. Berkeley. Hitherto, nearly all pyro-developed gelatine\r\nplates were stained a deep yellow colour by the action of ammonia, but\r\nthe use of sulphite of soda, as suggested by Mr. Berkeley, considerably\r\nlessened this evil.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, Captain Abney rendered a signal service to the members of the\r\nPhotographic Society, and photographers in general, by publishing in the\r\nJournal of the Society a translation of Captain Pizzighelli and Baron A.\r\nHubl's booklet on platinotype. After giving a _resume_ of the early\r\nexperiments with platinum by Herschel, Hunt, and others, the theory and\r\npractice of platinotype printing are clearly explained, and it was\r\nundoubtedly due to the publication of this translation that platinotype\r\nprinting was very much popularised. In proof of the accuracy of this\r\nopinion, every following photographic exhibition showed an increasing\r\nnumber of exhibits in platinotype.\r\n\r\nNo great novelty was brought into the world of photography in 1884, but\r\nthere were signs of a steady advance, and an increasing number of\r\nworkers with dry plates. I should not, however, neglect allusion to the\r\npublication of Dr. H. W. Vogel's experiments with eosine, cyanocine, and\r\nother kindred bodies by which he increased the sensitiveness of both wet\r\ncollodion and gelatine plates to the action of the yellow rays\r\nconsiderably (_vide_ Journal of Society, May 30th). The Berlin Society\r\nfor the Advancement of Photography acquired and published these\r\nexperiments for the general good, and yet Tailfer and Clayton obtained\r\npatent right monopolies for making eosine gelatine plates in France,\r\nAustria, and England. This proceeding seems very much akin to the sharp\r\npractice displayed by Mr. Beard in securing a patent right monopoly in\r\nthe Daguerreotype process which was _given to the world_ by the French\r\nGovernment in 1839. Germany very properly refused to grant a patent\r\nunder these circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn April 14th, 1885, Mr. Walter Bird read a paper at the meeting of the\r\nPhotographic Society of Great Britain, \"On the Photographic\r\nReproductions of Pictures in the National Gallery,\" by A. Braun et Cie.\r\nI was present, and it appeared to me that the \"effects\" in some of the\r\npictures exhibited were not produced by any chemical mode of translation\r\nof colour, but by some method of after-treatment of the negative which\r\nwas more likely to be by skilled labour than by any chemical process.\r\nThis belief induced me to read a paper at the next meeting--May\r\n12th--\"On the After-Treatment of Negatives,\" in which I showed what\r\ncould be done both by chemical means and art-labour to assist\r\nphotography in translating the monographic effects of colour more in\r\naccordance with the scale of luminosity adopted and adhered to by the\r\nmost eminent engravers both in line and mezzotint.\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting--June 9th--Mr. J. R. Sawyer reopened the discussion\r\non the above subject by reading a paper and exhibiting examples of his\r\nown experiments, and Mr. Sawyer admitted that he was \"bound to confess\r\nthat while every effort should be made to discover chemical combinations\r\nwhich will give the utmost value that can be practicably obtained in the\r\nreproduction (?) of colours, yet that, in all probability, art--and art\r\nnot inferior to that of a competent engraver--will be necessary to\r\nassist photography in rendering the very subtle combinations of colour\r\nthat present themselves in a fine painting;\" and Colonel H. Stuart\r\nWortley proved that the copy of Turner's \"Old Temeraire\" was not only\r\n\"retouched,\" but wrongly translated, as the various shades of yellow in\r\nthe original picture were represented in the copy as if they had been\r\nall of the same tint. Mr. Sawyer made use of the phrase \"reproduction of\r\ncolours,\" but that was an error. He should have said--and undoubtedly\r\nmeant--translation of colours, for photography is, unfortunately,\r\nincapable of reproducing colours. Among Mr. Sawyer's examples was a\r\ncurious and contradictory evidence that isochromatic plates translated\r\nyellow tints better than ordinary bromide plates, yet wrongly, for\r\nthree different shades of yellow were translated as if they had been all\r\none tint. I had noticed this myself when copying paintings and coloured\r\nprints, but in photographing the natural colours of fruits and flowers\r\nthe result was different, and I attributed the mal-translation of\r\npigment yellows to the amount of white with which they had been mixed by\r\nthe painter. Be that as it may, I always obtained the best translation\r\nfrom natural colours, and a group of flowers which contained a beautiful\r\nsulphur coloured dahlia illustrates and confirms this statement in a\r\nmost remarkable and satisfactory manner. It is, therefore, the more to\r\nbe regretted that there is any restriction placed upon the individual\r\nexperiment and development of this interesting aspect of photography.\r\n\r\nThis was the year of The International Inventions Exhibition, and the\r\nphotographic feature of which was the historical collection exhibited by\r\nsome of the members of the Photographic Society of Great Britain, and I\r\nthink that collection was sufficiently interesting to justify my giving,\r\nin these pages, the entire list as published in the _Photographic\r\nJournal_:--\r\n\r\n\"We subjoin a full and complete statement of the whole of the exhibits,\r\nwith the names of the contributors:--\r\n\r\n\"Capt.

Apparatus for mixing emulsion.\r\nInstantaneous shutter, with horizontal motion by finger or pneumatic\r\ntube; adjustable wings for cutting off sky, and varying length of\r\nexposure.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a very remarkable circumstance that none of the contributors to\r\nthat historical collection could include among their interesting\r\nexhibits portraits of either Nicephore Niepce or Frederick Scott Archer.\r\nAmong my \"Fathers of Photography\" were portraits of Daguerre, Rev. J. B.\r\nReade, Fox Talbot, Dr. Alfred Swaine Taylor, and Sir John Herschel. It\r\nwas suggested that those historical exhibits should be left at the close\r\nof the exhibition to form a nucleus to a permanent photographic\r\nexhibition in Kensington Museum. I readily contributed my exhibits\r\ntowards such a laudable object. They were accepted, and these exhibits\r\nmay be seen at any time in the West Gallery of the Science Department\r\nof the South Kensington Museum.\r\n\r\nAt the exhibition of the Photographic Society of Great Britain this\r\nyear, I exhibited \"Wollaston's Diaphragmatic Shutter,\" in my opinion the\r\nbest snap shutter that ever was invented, but it had two very serious\r\ndrawbacks, for it was both _heavy_ and _expensive_.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 more than usual interest was exhibited by photographers in what\r\nwas misnamed as the isochromatic, or orthochromatic process, and this\r\ninterest was probably created by the papers read and discussions that\r\nfollowed at the meetings of the Photographic Society in the previous\r\nyear. Messrs. Dixon and Gray--the latter a young man in the employ of\r\nMessrs. Dixon and Son--commenced a series of experiments with certain\r\ndyes with the hope of obtaining a truer translation of colour when\r\ncopying oil paintings or water-colour drawings, a class of work in which\r\nthey were largely interested, and had obtained a considerable reputation\r\nfor such reproductions as photography was then capable of rendering, and\r\none of the results of these experiments was exhibited, and obtained a\r\nmedal, at the exhibition of the Photographic Society in October. Messrs.\r\nDixon and Sons' exhibit was a very surprising one, and created quite a\r\nsensation, as nothing equal to it had ever been shown before. The\r\nsubject was a drawing of a yellow flower and green leaves against a blue\r\nground--the yellow the most luminous, the green next, and the blue the\r\ndarkest. In ordinary wet or dry plate photography these effects would\r\nhave been reversed, but by Dixon and Gray's process the relative\r\nluminosities of these three colours were almost perfectly translated.\r\nMessrs. Dixon and Gray did not publish their process, but prepared\r\nexisting gelatine dry plates by their method, and sold them at an\r\nenhanced price. They were not, however, permitted to supply anyone long,\r\nfor B. J. Edwards, who had obtained a monopoly of Tailfer and Clayton's\r\npatent rights in England, served them with an injunction, or threatened\r\nthem with legal proceedings, so they discontinued preparing their\r\northochromatic plates for sale. By some special arrangement they were\r\nallowed to prepare plates for their own use, provided they used Edwards'\r\nXL dry plates.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, however, that this proviso was not a hardship, for Mr.\r\nDixon told me himself that he had found Edwards' plates the most\r\nsuitable for their process. The hardship lay in not being able to apply\r\ntheir own discovery or preparation to any dry plates for sale for the\r\npublic use and benefit. This prohibition was the more to be regretted\r\nbecause no other commercial isochromatic or orthochromatic plates had or\r\nhave appeared to possess the same qualities of translation. The\r\nsuppression of the Dixon and Gray preparation of plates is the more\r\nsurprising when I find eosine is mentioned in the Clayton and Tailfer\r\nclaim, whereas Mr. Dixon assured me that eosine was not employed by\r\nthem. Mr. Edwards only acquired his monopoly and right to interfere with\r\nthe commercial application of an independent discovery on Nov. 18th,\r\n1886, and there is little to be gained in England by the publication of\r\nthe experiments of such men as Vogel, Eder, Ives, and Abney, if one man\r\ncan prevent all others making use of them.\r\n\r\nThis year death removed from our midst one, and perhaps the greatest, of\r\nthe martyrs of photography--Sylvester Laroche. This was the man that\r\nfought the battle for freedom from the shackles of monopoly. He won the\r\nfight, but lost his money, and the photographers of the day failed to\r\nmake him a suitable recompense. There was one honourable exception, and\r\nMr. Sylvester told me himself that Mr. J. E. Mayall gave him L100\r\ntowards his legal expenses. Laroche's surname was Sylvester, but as\r\nthere was a whole family of that name photographers, he added Laroche to\r\ndistinguish himself from his brothers. Sylvester Laroche was an artist,\r\nand worked very cleverly in pastel, but somehow or other he never\r\nappeared to prosper.\r\n\r\nNothing particular marked the photographic record of 1887, but death was\r\nbusy in removing men who had made their mark both in the early and later\r\ndays of photography. First, on March 19th, Robert Hunt, the most copious\r\nwriter on photography in its earlier period. As early as 1844 he\r\npublished the first edition of his \"Researches on Light,\" in which he\r\nwas considerably assisted by Sir John Herschel, and it is astonishing to\r\nfind what a mine of photographic information that early work contains.\r\n\r\nThe next was Colonel Russell, better known, photographically, as Major\r\nRussell. He was born in 1820, and died on May 16th, 1887. He was best\r\nknown for his tannin process and alkaline developer, with a bromide\r\nsolution as a restrainer. For a long time his tannin process was very\r\npopular among collodion dry plate workers, and very beautiful pictures\r\nwere taken on Russell's Tannin Plates, but it is many years since they\r\nwere ruthlessly brushed aside, like all other collodion dry plates, by\r\nthe now universally employed gelatino-bromide plates or films.\r\n\r\nA revival of interest in pinhole photography was awakened this year, and\r\nseveral modes of constructing a pinhole camera were published; but I\r\nremember seeing a wonderful picture by a _keyhole_ camera long before I\r\nbecame a photographer. I had called to see an old lady who lived\r\nopposite a mill and farm. It was a bright, sunny afternoon, and, when I\r\nwas leaving, I was astonished to see a beautiful picture of the mill and\r\nfarm on the wall of the hall. \"Ah!\" said the old lady; \"that's my\r\ncamera-obscura. When the sun shines on the mill at this time of day, I\r\nam sure to have a picture of the mill brought through the keyhole.\" It\r\nwas something like this that suggested the camera-obscura to Roger Bacon\r\nand Baptista Porta. So it is not necessary to have such a small hole to\r\nobtain a picture, but it is necessary to have the smallest hole possible\r\nto obtain the _sharpest_ picture.\r\n\r\nPizzighelli's visible platinotype printing paper was introduced this\r\nyear, and I welcomed it as a boon, for the double reasons of its\r\nsimplicity and permanency. I had been longing for years for such a\r\nprocess, for I, like Roger Fenton, had come to the conclusion that there\r\nwas no future for photography, in consequence of the instability of\r\nsilver prints. They would be much more durable than they are if they\r\nwere only washed in several changes of warm water, but few people will\r\nbe at the trouble to do that, some because they don't know the efficacy\r\nof warm water, and others because it lowers the tone. An eminent\r\nphotographer once asked me how to render silver prints permanent; but\r\nwhen I told him there was nothing equal to warm water washing, he\r\nexclaimed, \"Oh! but that spoils the tone.\" When a photographer\r\nsacrifices durability to tone, he is scarcely acting honestly towards\r\nhis customers. Admitted that there is nothing so beautiful in\r\nphotography as a good silver print when it has its first bloom on it,\r\nneither is there anything so grievously disappointing as a silver print\r\nin its last stage of decay. It is quite time that the _durability_ of a\r\nphotograph should be the first consideration of every photographer, as\r\nwell as the amateur. Years ago I proposed and published a plan of\r\nraising a fund to induce chemists and scientists to consider the\r\nsubject, but not a single photographer responded by subscribing his\r\nguinea.\r\n\r\nA very simple and interesting means of making photographs at night was\r\nintroduced this year by Dr. Piffard, an amateur photographer of New\r\nYork, and the extreme simplicity and efficacy of his method was\r\nsurprising. For good portraiture it is not equal to the electric light,\r\nbut for family groups, at home occupations or amusements, it is\r\nsuperior, and I have taken such groups with Piffard's magnesium\r\nflash-light, which no other means of lighting would have enabled me to\r\nproduce. I have taken groups of people playing at cards, billiards, and\r\nother games in their own homes with the simplest of apparatus, the\r\nordinary lens and camera, plus an old tea tray--but to obtain the best\r\nresults, the quickest lens and the quickest dry plates should be\r\nemployed, and I have always found the best position for the light to be\r\non the top of the camera.\r\n\r\n1888 is chiefly remarkable for the attempted revival of the stereoscope,\r\nand Mr. W. F. Donkin read an interesting and instructive paper on the\r\nsubject, in which he endeavoured to account for its disappearance,\r\nexplain its principles, and give an historical account of its early\r\nconstruction, and modern or subsequent improvements. As to its immense\r\npopularity thirty to thirty-five years ago, that was due to its novelty,\r\nand the marvellous effect of solidity the pictures assumed when viewed\r\nin the stereoscope; but it soon ceased to be popular when the views\r\nbecame stale, and people grew tired of looking at them; to keep up the\r\ninterest they had to be continually buying fresh ones, and of this they\r\nsoon got tired also; and when hosts saw that their guests were bored\r\nwith sights so often seen, they put them out of sight altogether, and I\r\nfear that nothing will, for the same reasons, bring about a revival of\r\nthe revolving or any other form of stereoscopes, for views. It is\r\nbecoming much the same now with lantern slides--possessors and their\r\nfriends grow weary of the subjects seen so frequently, and hiring\r\ninstead of buying slides is becoming the practice of those who own an\r\noptical lantern.\r\n\r\nWith stereoscopic portraits it was not so, for there was always a\r\npersonal and family interest attached to them, and I made a great many\r\nstereoscopic portraits by the Daguerreotype process; but even they were\r\nsomewhat ruthlessly and precipitately displaced when the carte-de-visite\r\nmania took possession of the public mind. However, I see no reason why\r\nstereoscopic portraiture should not be revived if good pictures were\r\nproduced on ivoryine, and it appears to me that substance is most\r\nsuitable for the purpose, as the pictures can be examined either by\r\nreflected or transmitted light. Everyone interested in stereoscopic\r\nphotography should \"read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest,\" the late\r\nMr. Donkin's able and instructive paper on \"Stereoscopes and Binocular\r\nVision,\" published in the journal of the Photographic Society, January\r\n27th, 1888. This was unhappily the last paper that Mr. Donkin read at\r\nthe Photographic Society, for he was unfortunately lost in the Caucasus\r\nthe following autumn. W. F. Donkin, M.A., F.C.S., F.I.C., was for\r\nseveral years Honorary Secretary of the Photographic Society and of the\r\nAlpine Club, and, at the November meeting of the Photographic Society,\r\nthe President, James Glaisher, F.R.S., made the following remarks on the\r\nmelancholy event:--\"There is, I am sure, but one feeling in regard to\r\nthe fact that the gentleman who usually sits on my right is not here\r\nto-night. Our Secretary, W. F. Donkin, is, I fear, irretrievably lost in\r\nthe Caucasus. The feeling of every member of this Society is one of\r\nrespect and esteem towards him. During the time he held the post of\r\nSecretary, his uniform courtesy won him the respect of all. I fear we\r\nshall see him no more.\" This fear was afterwards confirmed by the search\r\nparty, which was headed by Mr. C. T. Dent, President of the Alpine Club.\r\nThe late Mr. Donkin was both an expert Alpine climber and photographer,\r\nand many of his photographs of Alpine scenery have been published and\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\nEvery year compels me to record the death of some old and experienced\r\nphotographer, or some artist associated with photography from its\r\nearliest introduction. Among the latter was Norman Macbeth, R.S.A., an\r\neminent portrait painter, who was quick to see and ready to avail\r\nhimself of the invaluable services of a new art, or means of improving\r\nart, both in drawing and detail, and make the newly-discovered power a\r\nhelp in his own labours, and an economiser of the time of his sitters.\r\nThe first time I had the pleasure of meeting him was in Glasgow in 1855,\r\nwhen he brought one of his sitters to me to be Daguerreotyped, and he\r\npreferred a Daguerreotype as long as he could get one, on account of its\r\nextreme delicacy and details in the shadows; but he could not obtain any\r\nmore Daguerreotypes after 1857, for at that time I abandoned the\r\nDaguerreotype for ever, and was the last to practise the process in\r\nGlasgow, and probably throughout Great Britain.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Mr. Macbeth commenced taking photographs himself, he\r\ntook a keen interest in photography to the last, and only about a month\r\nbefore he died, he read an able, instructive, and interesting paper on\r\nthe \"Construction and Requirements of Portrait Art\" before the members\r\nof the London and Provincial Photographic Association; and that paper\r\nshould be in the possession, and frequent perusal, of every student of\r\nphotographic portraiture. Although an artist in feeling and by\r\nprofession, Mr. Macbeth was no niggard in his praises of artistic\r\nphotography, and I have frequently heard him expatiate lovingly on the\r\nartistic productions of Rejlander, Robinson, and Hubbard; but, like all\r\nartists, he abominated retouching, and denounced it in the strongest\r\nterms, and regretted its prevalence and practice as destructive of\r\ntruth, and \"truth in photography,\" he used to say, \"was its greatest\r\nrecommendation.\"\r\n\r\nThe annals of 1889--the jubilee year of published and commercial\r\nphotography--commence with the record of death. On the 21st of January,\r\nMr. John Robert Sawyer died at Naples in the 61st year of his age. Mr.\r\nSawyer had been for many years a member of the Autotype Company, and his\r\nforesight and indefatigability were largely instrumental in making that\r\nCompany a commercial success. It was anything but a success from the\r\ntime that it was commenced by the late Mr. Winsor and Mr. J. R. Johnson,\r\nbut from the moment that Mr. J. R. Sawyer became \"director of works,\"\r\nthe company rapidly became a flourishing concern, and possesses now a\r\nworld-wide reputation. Mr. Sawyer was one of the early workers in\r\nphotography, and for several years conducted a photographic business in\r\nthe city of Norwich. It was there that circumstances induced him to give\r\nhis attention to some form of permanent photography with the view of\r\nemploying it to illustrate a work on the carving and sculpture in\r\nNorwich Cathedral, particularly the fine work in the roof of the nave.\r\nMr. Sawyer naturally turned his attention, in the first place, to the\r\nautotype process, but it was then in its infancy, and the price\r\nprohibitory. The collotype process then became his hope and refuge, but\r\nthat also was in its infancy, and not practised in England. Mr. Sawyer\r\ntherefore started for Berlin early in 1869, and there met a certain Herr\r\nGhemoser, a clever expert in the collotype process, from whom he\r\nobtained valuable information and working instructions. On his return\r\nhome, Mr. Sawyer laboured at the collotype process until he overcame\r\nmost of its difficulties, and on January 1st, 1871, he entered into\r\npartnership with Mr. Walter Bird, and removed to London with the\r\nintention of making the collotype process a feature in the business.\r\nMessrs. Sawyer and Bird commenced their London experiences in Regent\r\nStreet, but on January 1st, 1872, they entered into an agreement with\r\nthe Autotype Fine Art Company to work the collotype process as a branch\r\nof their business. Meanwhile, another partner, Mr. John Spencer, had\r\njoined the firm, and at the end of that year Messrs. Spencer, Sawyer,\r\nBird and Co. purchased the Autotype patents, plant, and stock at Ealing\r\nDene, and all its interest in the wholesale trade; and, in 1874, they\r\nbought up the whole of the Fine Art business, including the stock in\r\nRathbone Place, and became the Autotype Company.\r\n\r\nThe great photographic feature of this year was the Convention held on\r\nAugust 19th in St. James's Hall, Regent Street, London, in celebration\r\nof the jubilee of practical photography, which was inaugurated by the\r\ndelivery of an address by the president, Mr. Andrew Pringle. The address\r\nwas a fairly good resume of all that had been done for the advancement\r\nof photography during the past fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition of photographs was somewhat of a failure; little was\r\nshown that possessed any historical interest, and that little was\r\ncontributed by myself. There was a considerable display of apparatus of\r\nalmost every description, but there was nothing that had not been seen,\r\nor could have been seen, in the shops of the exhibitors.\r\n\r\nThe papers that were read were of considerable interest, and imparted no\r\nsmall amount of information, especially Mr. Thos. R. Dallmeyer's on\r\n\"False Rendering of Photographic Images by the Misapplication of\r\nLenses\"; Mr. C. H. Bothamley's on \"Orthochromatic Photography with\r\nGelatine Plates\"; Mr. Thomas Bolas's on \"The Photo-mechanical Printing\r\nMethods as employed in the Jubilee Year of Photography\"; but by far the\r\nmost popular, wonderful, and instructive, was Professor E. Muybridge's\r\nlecture, with illustrations, on \"The Movements of Animals.\" The sight of\r\nthe formidable batteries of lenses was startling enough, but when the\r\nactions of the horse, and other animals, were shown in the\r\n\"Zoopraxiscope,\" the effect on the sense of sight was both astounding\r\nand convincing, and I began to marvel how artists could have lived and\r\nlaboured in the wrong direction for so many years, especially when the\r\nlecturer showed that a prehistoric artist had scratched on a bone a rude\r\nbut truthful representation of an animal in motion. Both the sight and\r\nintelligence of that prehistoric artist must have been keener than the\r\nsenses of animal painters of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nTaking it all in all, the Jubilee Convention was an immense success, and\r\nbrought photographers and amateurs to London from the most distant parts\r\nof the country. Looking round the Hall on the opening night, and\r\nscanning the features of those present, I was coming to the conclusion\r\nthat I was the oldest photographer present, when I espied Mr. Baynham\r\nJones, a man of eighty-three winters, and certainly the oldest amateur\r\nphotographer living; so I willingly ceded the honour of seniority to\r\nhim, and as soon as he espied me he clambered over the rails to come and\r\nsit at my side and talk over the past, and quite unknown to many\r\npresent, aspects and difficulties of photography. Mr. Baynham Jones was\r\nan enthusiastic photographer from the very first, for in 1839, as soon\r\nas Daguerre's process was published, he made himself a camera out of a\r\ncigar-box and the lens of his opera-glass, and, being unable to obtain a\r\nDaguerreotype plate in the country, he cut up a silver salver and worked\r\naway on a solid silver plate until he succeeded in making a\r\nDaguerreotype picture. Mr. Baynham Jones was not the first photographer\r\nin this country, for the Rev. J. B. Reade preceded him by about two\r\nyears; but I have not the slightest doubt of his being the first\r\n_Daguerreotypist_ in England, and in that jubilee year of 1889 he was\r\nworking with gelatine plates and films, and enthusiastic enough to come\r\nall the way from Cheltenham to London to attend the meetings of the\r\nJubilee Convention of Photography.\r\n\r\nWith this brief allusion to the doings and attractions of the Jubilee\r\nConvention, I fear I must bring my reminiscences of photography to a\r\nclose; but before doing so I feel it incumbent on me to call attention\r\nto the fact that _two years_ after celebrating the jubilee of\r\nphotography we should, paradoxical as it may appear, celebrate its\r\ncentenary, for in 1791 the first photographic _picture_ that ever was\r\nmade, seen, or heard tell of, was produced by Thomas Wedgwood, and\r\nthough he was unable to fix it and enable us to look upon _that_ wonder\r\n_to-day_, the honour of being the first photographer, in its truest\r\nsense, is unquestionably due to an Englishman. Thomas Wedgwood made\r\nphotographic pictures on paper, and there they remained until light or\r\ntime obliterated them; whereas J. H. Schulze, a German physician, only\r\nobtained impressions of letters on a semi-liquid chloride of silver in a\r\nbottle, and at every shake of the hand the meagre impression was\r\ninstantly destroyed. If we consider such men as Niepce, Reade, Daguerre,\r\nand Fox Talbot the fathers of photography, we cannot but look upon\r\nThomas Wedgwood as the Grand Father, and the centenary of his first\r\nachievement should be celebrated with becoming honour as the English\r\ncentenary of photography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL RECORD\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nINVENTIONS, DISCOVERIES, PUBLICATIONS, AND APPLIANCES, FORMING\r\nFACTORS IN THE INCEPTION, DISCOVERY, AND DEVELOPMENT OF PHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1432 B.C.

Indeed, they are to be seen now in almost\r\nevery print-seller's window; and in the albums, stereoscopes, or folios\r\nof almost every private collector. But I question very much if it ever\r\noccurred to the mind of anyone, while looking at those pictures, what an\r\namount of labour, expense, and danger had to be endured and encountered\r\nto obtain them--\"the many hairbreadth 'scapes by flood and field,\" of a\r\nvery \"positive\" character, which had to be risked before some of the\r\n\"negatives\" could be \"boxed.\" Doubtless Mr. England, Mr. Stephen\r\nThompson, and Mr. Wilson have many very vivid recollections of the\r\ncritical situations they have been in while photographing the\r\npicturesque scenery of the Alpine passes of Switzerland, and the\r\nHighlands and glens of Scotland.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephen Thompson has narrated to me one or two of his \"narrow\r\nescapes\" while photographing his \"Swiss scenes,\" and I am sure Mr.\r\nEngland did not procure his many and beautiful \"points of view\" of\r\nNiagara Falls without exposing himself to considerable risk.\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to be one of the earlier pioneers, in company\r\nwith a Yankee friend, Mr. Easterly, in taking photographs of the Falls;\r\nand my recollections of the manner in which we \"went about,\" poised\r\nourselves and cameras on \"points of rock\" and \"ledges of bluffs,\" and\r\nfelled trees, and lopped off branches overhanging precipices, to \"gain a\r\npoint,\" even at the distant date are somewhat thrilling. To take a\r\nphotograph of what is called \"Visitors' View\" is safe and easy enough.\r\nYou might plant a dozen cameras on the open space at the brink of the\r\n\"American Fall,\" and photograph the scene, visitors and all, as they\r\nstand, \"fixed\" with wonder, gazing at the Falls, American, Centre, and\r\nHorseshoe, Goat Island, and the shores of Canada included, for this\r\npoint embraces in one view all those subjects. But to get at the\r\nout-of-the-way places, to take the Falls in detail, and obtain some of\r\nthe grandest views of them, is a very different matter.\r\n\r\nI remember, when we started, taking a hatchet with us, like\r\nbackwoodsmen, to take a view of Prospect Tower, on the American side of\r\nthe great Horseshoe Fall, how we had to hew down the trees that\r\nobstructed the light; how we actually hung over the precipice, holding\r\non to each other's hands, to lop off a branch still in sight where it\r\nwas not wanted. The manner in which we accomplished this was what some\r\nbystanders pronounced \"awful.\" I hugged a sapling of a silver birch,\r\ngrowing on the brink of the precipice, with my left arm, while friend\r\nEasterly, holding my right hand with one of the Masonic grips--I won't\r\nsay which--_hung over_ the precipice, and stretching out as far as he\r\ncould reach, lopped off the offending branch. Yet in this perilous\r\nposition my lively companion must crack his joke by punning upon my\r\nname, and a Cockney weakness at the same time, for he \"guessed he was\r\nbelow the _w_erge of the precipice.\" The branch down, and we had resumed\r\nour perpendicular positions, he simply remarked, if that was not\r\nholding on to a man's hand in _friendship_, he did not know what was.\r\n\r\nBut the _work_ was not done yet; to get the view of the Tower we wanted,\r\nwe had to make a temporary platform over the precipice. This we managed\r\nby laying a piece of \"lumber\" across a fallen tree, and, unshipping the\r\ncamera, shoved it along the plank until it was in position, balancing\r\nthe shore end of the plank with heavy stones. When all was ready for\r\nexposure, I went round and stood on the point of a jutting rock to give\r\nsome idea of the great depth of the Fall, but I very nearly discovered,\r\nand just escaped being myself the plummet. In the excitement of the\r\nmoment, and not thinking that the rock would be slimy and slippery with\r\nthe everlasting spray, I went too rapidly forward, and the rock having a\r\nslight decline, I slipped, but was fortunately brought up by a juniper\r\nbush growing within a foot of the edge. For a second or two I lay on my\r\nback wondering if I could slide out of my difficulty as easily as I had\r\nslidden into it. In a moment I determined to go backwards on my back,\r\nhands, and feet, until I laid hold of another bush, and could safely\r\nassume a perpendicular position. After giving the signal that \"all was\r\nright,\" the plate was exposed, and I _cautiously_ left a spot I have no\r\ndesire to revisit. But it is astonishing how the majesty and grandeur of\r\nthe scene divest the mind of all sense of fear, and to this feeling, to\r\na great extent, is attributed the many accidents and terrible deaths\r\nthat have befallen numerous visitors to the Falls.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, the tribe of the Iroquois, who were the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of that part of the country, had a tradition that the \"Great\r\nSpirit\" of the \"Mighty Waters\" required the sacrifice of two human lives\r\nevery year. To give rise to such a tradition, doubtless, many a red man,\r\nin his skiff, had gone over the Falls, centuries before they were\r\ndiscovered by the Jesuit missionary, Father Hennepin, in 1678; and, even\r\nin these days of Christian civilization, and all but total extirpation\r\nof the aboriginals, the \"Great Spirit\" does not appear to be any less\r\nexacting. Nearly every year one or more persons are swept over those\r\nawful cataracts, making an average of at least one per annum. Many\r\nvisitors and local residents have lost their lives under the most\r\npainful and afflicting circumstances, the most remarkable of which\r\noccurred just before my visit. One morning, at daylight, a man was\r\ndiscovered in the middle of the rapids, a little way above the brink of\r\nthe American Fall. He was perched upon a log which was jammed between\r\ntwo rocks. One end of the log was out of the water, and the poor fellow\r\nwas comparatively dry, but with very little hope of being rescued from\r\nhis dreadful situation. No one could possibly reach him in a boat. The\r\nfoaming and leaping waters were rushing past him at the rate of eighteen\r\nor twenty miles an hour, and he knew as well as anyone that to attempt a\r\nrescue in a boat or skiff would be certain destruction, yet every effort\r\nwas made to save him. Rafts were made and let down, but they were either\r\nsubmerged, or the ropes got fast in the rocks. The life-boat was brought\r\nfrom Buffalo, Lake Erie, and that was let down to him by ropes from the\r\nbridge, but they could not manage the boat in that rush of waters, and\r\ngave it up in despair. One of the thousands of agonized spectators, a\r\nSouthern planter, offered a thousand dollars reward to anyone that would\r\nsave the \"man on the log.\" Another raft was let down to him, and this\r\ntime was successfully guided to the spot. He got on it, but being weak\r\nfrom exposure and want, he was unable to make himself fast or retain his\r\nhold, and the doomed man was swept off the raft and over the Falls\r\nalmost instantly, before the eyes of thousands, who wished, but were\r\npowerless and unable, to rescue him from his frightful death. His name\r\nwas Avery. He and another man were taking a pleasure sail on the Upper\r\nNiagara river, their boat got into the current, was sucked into the\r\nrapids, and smashed against the log or the rock. The other man went over\r\nthe Falls at the time of the accident; but Avery clung to the log, where\r\nhe remained for about eighteen hours in such a state of mind as no one\r\ncould possibly imagine. None could cheer him with a word of hope, for\r\nthe roar of the rapids and thunder of the cataracts rendered all other\r\nsounds inaudible. Mr. Babbitt, a resident photographer, took several\r\nDaguerreotypes of the \"man on the log,\" one of which he kindly presented\r\nto me. Few of the bodies are ever recovered. One or two that went over\r\nthe Great Horse Shoe Fall were found, their bodies in a state of\r\ncomplete nudity. The weight or force of the water strips them of every\r\nparticle of clothing; but that is not to be wondered at, considering the\r\nimmense weight of water that rolls over every second, the distance it\r\nhas to fall, and the depth of the foaming cauldron below. The fall of\r\nthe Horse Shoe to the surface of the lower river is 158 feet, and the\r\ndepth of the cauldron into which the Upper Niagara leaps about 300 feet,\r\nmaking a total of 458 feet from the upper to the lower bed of the\r\nNiagara River at the Great Horse Shoe Fall. It has been computed that\r\none hundred million, two hundred thousand tons of water pass over the\r\nFalls every hour. The depth of the American Fall is 164 feet; but that\r\nfalls on to a mass of broken rocks a few feet above the level of the\r\nlower river.\r\n\r\nOur next effort was to get a view of the Centre Fall, or \"Cave of the\r\nWinds,\" from the south, looking at the Centre and American Falls, down\r\nthe river as far as the Suspension Bridge, about two miles below, and\r\nthe Lower or Long Rapids, for there are rapids both above and below the\r\nFalls. In this we succeeded tolerably well, and without any difficulty.\r\nThen, descending the \"Biddle Stairs\" to the foot of the two American\r\ncataracts, we tried the \"Cave of the Winds\" itself; but, our process\r\nnot being a \"wet\" one, had no sympathy with the blinding and drenching\r\nspray about us. However, I secured a pencil sketch of the scene we\r\ncould not photograph, and afterwards took one of the most novel and\r\nfearful shower-baths to be had in the world. Dressed--or, rather,\r\nundressed--for the purpose, and accompanied by a guide, I passed down\r\nby the foot of the precipice, under the Centre Fall, and along a wet and\r\nslippery pole laid across a chasm, straddling it by a process I cannot\r\ndescribe--for I was deaf with the roar and blind with the spray--we\r\nreached in safety a flat rock on the other side, and then stood erect\r\nbetween the two sheets of falling water. To say that I saw anything\r\nwhile there would be a mistake; but I know and felt by some\r\ndemonstrations, other than ocular, that I was indulging in a bath of the\r\nwildest and grandest description. Recrossing the chasm by the pole, we\r\nnow entered the \"Cave of the Winds,\" which is immediately under the\r\nCentre Fall. The height and width of the cave is one hundred feet, and\r\nthe depth sixty feet. It takes its name from the great rush of wind into\r\nthe cave, caused by the fall of the waters from above. Standing in the\r\ncave, which is almost dry, you can view the white waters, like\r\navalanches of snow, tumbling over and over in rapid succession. The\r\nforce of the current of the rapids above shoots the water at least\r\ntwenty feet from the rock, describing, as it were, the segment of a\r\ncircle. By this circumstance only are you able to pass under the Centre\r\nFall, and a portion of the Horse Shoe Fall on the Canadian side. To\r\nreturn, we ascended the \"Biddle Stairs,\" a spiral staircase of 115\r\nsteps, on the west side of Goat Island, crossed the latter, and by a\r\nsmall bridge passed to Bath Island, which we left by the grand bridge\r\nwhich crosses the rapids about 250 yards above the American Fall.\r\nReaching the American shore again in safety, after a hard day's work, we\r\navailed ourselves of Mr. Babbitt's kindness and hospitality to develop\r\nour plates in his dark room, and afterwards developed ourselves,\r\nsociably and agreeably, refreshing the inner man, and narrating our\r\nday's adventures.\r\n\r\nI shall now endeavour to describe our next trip, which was to the\r\nCanadian side--how we got there, what we did, and what were the\r\nimpressions produced while contemplating those wonderful works of\r\nnature. In the first place, to describe how we descended to the \"ferry\"\r\nand crossed the river. On the north side of the American Fall a railway\r\nhas been constructed by an enterprising American, where the \"cars\" are\r\nlet down a steep decline by means of water-power, the proprietor of the\r\nrailway having utilized the very smallest amount of the immense force so\r\nnear at hand. Placing our \"traps\" in the car, and seating ourselves\r\ntherein, the lever was moved by the \"operator,\" and away we went down\r\nthe decline as if we were going plump into the river below; but at the\r\nproper time the water was turned off, and we were brought to a\r\nstandstill close by the boat waiting to ferry us across. Shifting our\r\ntraps and selves into the boat and sitting down, the ferryman bent to\r\nthe oars and off we dashed into the dancing and foaming waters, keeping\r\nher head well to the stream, and drawing slowly up until we came right\r\nabreast of the American Fall; then letting her drop gently down the\r\nstream, still keeping her head to the current, we gained the Canadian\r\nshore; our course on the river describing the figure of a cone, the apex\r\ntowards the \"Horse Shoe.\" Ascending the banks by a rather uphill road,\r\nwe reached the Clifton Hotel, where we took some refreshments, and then\r\ncommenced our labours of photographing the Grand Rapids and the Falls,\r\nfrom Table Rock, or what remained of it. On arriving at the spot, we set\r\ndown our traps and looked about bewildered for the best point. To\r\nattempt to describe the scene now before us would be next to folly, nor\r\ncould the camera, from the limited angle of our lens, possibly convey an\r\nadequate idea of the grandeur and terrific beauty of the Grand Rapids,\r\nas you see them rushing and foaming, white with rage, for about two and\r\na half miles before they make their final plunge over the precipice.\r\nMany years ago an Indian was seen standing up in his canoe in the midst\r\nof these fearful rapids. Nearing the brink of the terrible Fall, and\r\nlooking about him, he saw that all hope was lost, for he had passed\r\nGull Island, his only chance of respite; waving his hand, he was seen\r\nto lie down in the bottom of his canoe, which shot like an arrow into\r\nthe wild waters below, and he was lost for ever. Neither he nor his\r\ncanoe was ever seen again. In 1829 the ship _Detroit_, loaded with a\r\nlive buffalo, bear, deer, fox, &c., was sent over the Falls. She was\r\nalmost dashed to pieces in the rapids, but many persons saw the remains\r\nof the ship rolled over into the abyss of waters. No one knew what\r\nbecame of the animals on board. And in 1839, during the Canadian\r\nRebellion, the steamer _Caroline_ was set fire to in the night and cast\r\nadrift. She was drawn into the rapids, but struck on Gull Island, and\r\nwas much shattered by the collision. The bulk of the burning mass was\r\nswept over the Falls, but few witnessed the sight. Doubtless no fire on\r\nboard a ship was ever extinguished so suddenly. The view from Table Rock\r\nis too extensive to be rendered on one plate by an ordinary camera; but\r\nthe pantascopic camera would give the very best views that could\r\npossibly be obtained.\r\n\r\nTaking Table Rock as the centre, the entire sweep of the Fall is about\r\n180 degrees, and stretching from point to point for nearly\r\nthree-quarters of a mile--from the north side of the American Fall to\r\nthe termination of the Horse Shoe Fall on the west side. The American\r\nand Centre Falls present a nearly straight line running almost due north\r\nand south, while the Great Horse Shoe Fall presents a line or figure\r\nresembling a sickle laid down with the left hand, the convex part of the\r\nbow lying direct south, the handle lying due east and west, with the\r\npoint or termination to the west; the waters of the two American Falls\r\nrushing from east to west, and the waters of the Canadian Fall bounding\r\ntowards the north. By this description it will be seen that but for the\r\nintervention of Goat and Luna Islands the three sheets of water would\r\nembrace each other like mighty giants locked in a death struggle, before\r\nthey fell into the lower river. The whole aspect of the Falls from\r\nTable Rock is panoramic. Turning to the left, you see the American\r\nrapids rushing down furiously under the bridge, between Bath Island and\r\nthe American shore, with a force and velocity apparently great enough to\r\nsweep away the bridge and four small islands lying a little above the\r\nbrink, and pitch them all down on to the rocks below. Turning slowly to\r\nthe right, you see the Centre Fall leaping madly down between Luna and\r\nGoat Islands, covering the Cave of the Winds from view. A little more to\r\nthe right, the rocky and precipitous face of Goat or Iris Island, with\r\nthe \"Biddle Stairs\" like a perpendicular line running down the\r\nprecipice; and to the extreme right the immense sweeps of the Great\r\nHorse Shoe.\r\n\r\nDoubtless this fall took its name from its former resemblance to the\r\nshape of a horse shoe. It is, however, nothing like that now, but is\r\nexactly the figure of a sickle, as previously described. Looking far up\r\nthe river you observe the waters becoming broken and white, and so they\r\ncontinue to foam and rush and leap with increasing impetuosity, rushing\r\nmadly past the \"Three Sisters\"--three islands on the left--and \"Gull\r\nIsland\" in the middle of the rapids, on which it is supposed no man has\r\never trodden, until, with a roar of everlasting thunder, which shakes\r\nthe earth, they fall headlong into the vortex beneath. At the foot of\r\nthis Fall, and for a considerable distance beyond, the river is as white\r\nas the eternal snows, and as troubled as an angry sea. Indeed, I never\r\nbut once saw the Atlantic in such a state, and that was in a storm in\r\nwhich we had to \"lay to\" for four days in the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nThe colours and beauty of Niagara in sunlight are indescribable. You may\r\nconvey _some_ idea of its form, power, and majesty, by describing lines\r\nand giving figures of quantity and proportion, but to give the faintest\r\nimpression of its beauty and colours is almost hopeless. The rich,\r\nlovely green on the very brink of the Horse Shoe Fall is beyond\r\nconception. All the emeralds in the world, clustered together and bathed\r\nin sunlight, would fall far short of the beauty and brilliancy of that\r\npure and dazzling colour. It can only be compared to an immense, unknown\r\nbrilliant of the emerald hue, in a stupendous setting of the purest\r\nfrosted, yet sparkling silver. Here, too, is to be seen the marvellous\r\nbeauty of the prismatic colours almost daily. Here you might think the\r\n\"Covenant\" had been made, and set up to shine for ever and ever at the\r\nThrone of the Most Mighty, and here only can be seen the complete\r\n_circle_ of the colours of the rainbow. I saw this but once, when on\r\nboard the _Maid of the Mist_, and almost within the great vortex at the\r\nfoot of the Falls. A brilliant sun shining through the spray all round,\r\nplaced us in a moment as it were in the very centre of that beautiful\r\ncircle of colour, which, with the thunder of the cataract, and the\r\nsublimity of the scene, made the soul feel as if it were in the presence\r\nof the \"Great Spirit,\" and this the sign and seal of an eternal compact.\r\nHere, also, is to be seen the softer, but not the less beautiful Lunar\r\nRainbow. Whenever the moon is high enough in the heavens, the lunar bow\r\ncan be seen, not fitful as elsewhere, but constant and beautiful as long\r\nas the moon is shedding her soft light upon the spray. On one occasion I\r\nsaw two lunar bows at once, one on the spray from the American Fall, and\r\nthe other on the spray of the great Horse Shoe Fall. This I believe is\r\nnot usual, but an eddy of the wind brought the two clouds of spray under\r\nthe moon's rays. Yet these are not all the \"beauties of the mist.\" One\r\nmorning at sunrise I saw one of the most beautiful forms the spray could\r\npossibly assume. The night had been unusually calm, the morning was as\r\nstill as it could be, and the mist from the Horse Shoe had risen in a\r\nstraight column to a height of at least 300 feet, and then spread out\r\ninto a mass of huge rolling clouds, immediately above the cataracts. The\r\nrising sun shed a red lustre on the under edges of the cloud, which was\r\ntruly wonderful. It more resembled one huge, solitary column supporting\r\na canopy of silvery grey cloud, the edges of which were like burnished\r\ncopper, and highly suggestive of the Temple of the Most High, where man\r\nmust bow down and worship the great Creator of all these wondrous works.\r\nIt is not in a passing glance at Niagara that all its marvellous\r\nbeauties can be seen. You must stay there long enough to see it in all\r\nits aspects--in sunshine and in moonlight, in daylight and in darkness,\r\nin storm and in calm. No picture of language can possibly convey a just\r\nconception of the grandeur and vastness of these mighty cataracts. No\r\npoem has ever suggested a shadow of their majesty and sublimity. No\r\npainting has ever excited in the mind, of one that has not seen those\r\nmarvellous works of God, the faintest idea of their dazzling beauties.\r\nDescriptive writers, both in prose and verse, have failed to depict the\r\nglories of this \"Sovereign of the World of Floods.\" Painters have\r\nessayed with their most gorgeous colours, but have fallen far short of\r\nthe intense beauty, transparency, and purity of the water, and the\r\nwonderful radiance and brilliancy of the \"Rainbow in the Mist.\" And I\r\nfear the beauties of Niagara in natural colours can never be obtained in\r\nthe camera; but what a glorious triumph for photography if they were.\r\nMr. Church's picture, painted a few years ago, is the most faithful\r\nexponent of nature's gorgeous colouring of Niagara that has yet been\r\nproduced. Indeed, the brilliant and harmonious colouring of this grand\r\npicture can scarcely be surpassed by the hand and skill of man.\r\n\r\nAfter obtaining our views of the Grand Rapids and the Falls from Table\r\nRock, we put up our traps, and leaving them in charge of the courteous\r\nproprietor of the Museum, we prepared to go _under_ the great Horse Shoe\r\nFall. Clothing ourselves in india-rubber suits, furnished by our guide,\r\nwe descended the stairs near Table Rock, eighty-seven steps, and, led by\r\na negro, we went under the great sheet of water as far as we could go to\r\nTermination Rock, and standing there for a while in that vast cave of\r\nwatery darkness, holding on to the negro's hand, we felt lost in wonder\r\nand amazement, but not fear. How long we might have remained in that\r\nbewildering situation it would be impossible to say, but being gently\r\ndrawn back by our sable conductor, we returned to the light and\r\nconsciousness of our position. The volume of water being much greater\r\nhere than at the Cave of the Winds, and the spray being all around, we\r\ncould not see anything but darkness visible below, and an immense moving\r\nmass before, which we knew by feeling to be water. There is some\r\nfascination about the place, for after coming out into the daylight I\r\nwent back again alone, but the guide, hurrying after me, brought me\r\nback, and held my hand until we reached the stairs to return to the\r\nMuseum. On our way back our guide told us that more than \"twice-told\r\ntale\" of Niagara and Vesuvius. If I may be pardoned for mixing up the\r\nridiculous with the sublime, I may as well repeat the story, for having\r\njust come from under the Falls we were prepared to believe the truth of\r\nit, if the geographical difficulty could have been overcome. An Italian\r\nvisiting the Falls and going under the Horse Shoe, was asked, on coming\r\nout, what he thought of the sight. The Italian replied it was very grand\r\nand wonderful, but _nothing_ to the sight of Mount Vesuvius in a grand\r\neruption. The guide's retort was, \"I guess if you bring _your_ Vesuvius\r\nhere, _our_ Niagara will soon put his fires out.\" I do not vouch for the\r\ntruth of the story, but give it as nearly as possible as I was told.\r\nReturning to the Museum and making ourselves \"as we were,\" and\r\ncomforting ourselves with something inside after the wetting we had got\r\nout, we took up our traps, and wending our way back to the ferry,\r\nrecrossed the river in much the same manner that we crossed over in the\r\nmorning; and sending our \"baggage\" up in the cars we thought we would\r\nwalk up the \"long stairs,\" 290 steps, by the side of the railway. On\r\nnearing the top, we felt as if we must \"cave in,\" but having trodden so\r\nfar the back of a \"lion,\" we determined to see the end of his tail, and\r\npushing on to the top, we had the satisfaction of having accomplished\r\nthe task we had set ourselves. Perhaps before abandoning the Canadian\r\nside of Niagara, I should have said something about Table Rock, which,\r\nas I have said, is on the Canadian side, and very near to the Horse Shoe\r\nFall. It took its name from the table-like form it originally presented.\r\nIt was formerly much larger than it is now, but has, from time to time,\r\nfallen away. At one time it was very extensive and projected over the\r\nprecipice fifty or sixty feet, and was about 240 feet long and 100 feet\r\nthick. On the 26th of June, 1850, this tremendous mass of rock, nearly\r\nhalf an acre, fell into the river with a crash and a noise like the\r\nsound of an earthquake. The whole of that immense mass of rock was\r\nburied in the depths of the river, and completely hidden from sight. No\r\none was killed, which was a miracle, for several persons had been\r\nstanding on the rock just a few minutes before it fell. The vicinity is\r\nstill called Table Rock, though the projecting part that gave rise to\r\nthe name is gone. It is, nevertheless, the best point on the Canada side\r\nfor obtaining a grand and comprehensive view of Niagara Falls.\r\n\r\nThe next scenes of our photographic labours were Suspension Bridge, the\r\nLong Rapids, The Whirlpool, and Devil's Hole. These subjects, though not\r\nso grand as Niagara, are still interestingly and closely associated with\r\nthe topographical history and legendary interest of the Falls. And we\r\nthought a few \"impressions\" of the scenes, and a visit to the various\r\nplaces, would amply repay us for the amount of fatigue we should have to\r\nundergo on such a trip under the scorching sun of _August in America_.\r\nDescending to the shore, and stepping on board the steamer _Maid of the\r\nMist_, which plies up and down the river for about two miles, on the\r\ntranquil water between the Falls and the Lower Rapids, we were \"cast\r\noff,\" and in a little time reached the landing stage, a short distance\r\nabove the Long Rapids. Landing on the American side, we ascended the\r\nsteep road, which has been cut out of the precipice, and arriving at\r\nSuspension Bridge, proceeded to examine that wonderful specimen of\r\nengineering skill. It was not then finished, but the lower level was\r\ncomplete, and foot passengers and carriages could go along. They were\r\nbusy making the railway \"track\" overhead, so that, when finished (which\r\nit is now), it would be a bridge of two stories--the lower one for\r\npassengers on foot and carriages, the upper one for the \"cars.\" I did\r\nnot see a \"snorting monster\" going along that spider's-web-like\r\nstructure, but can very well imagine what must be the sensations of\r\n\"railway passengers\" as they pass along the giddy height. The span of\r\nthe bridge, from bank to bank, is 800 feet, and it is 230 feet from the\r\nriver to the lower or carriage road. The estimated cost was two hundred\r\nthousand dollars, about L40,000. A boy's toy carried the first wire\r\nacross the river. When the wind was blowing straight across, a wire was\r\nattached to a kite, and thus the connecting thread between the two sides\r\nwas secured, and afterwards by means of a running wheel, or traveller,\r\nwire after wire was sent across until each strand was made thick enough\r\nto carry the whole weight of the bridge, railway trains, and other\r\ntraffic which now pass along. We went on to the bridge, and looked down\r\non the rapids below, for the bridge spans the river at the narrowest\r\npoint, and right over the commencement of the Lower Rapids. It was more\r\nof a test to my nerves to stand at the edge of the bridge and look down\r\non those fearful rapids than it was to go under the Falls. To us, it\r\nseemed a miracle of ingenuity and skill how, from so frail a connection,\r\na mere wire, so stupendous a structure could have been formed; and yet,\r\nviewing it from below, or at a distance, it looked like a bridge of\r\nthreads. During its erection several accidents occurred. On one\r\noccasion, when the workmen were just venturing on to the cables to lay\r\nthe flooring, and before a plank was made fast, one of those sudden\r\nstorms, so peculiar to America, came up and carried away all the\r\nflooring into the Rapids. Four of the men were left hanging to the\r\nwires, which were swaying backwards and forwards in the hurricane in\r\nthe most frightful manner. Their cries for help could scarcely be heard,\r\nfrom the noise of the Rapids and the howling of the wind, but the\r\nworkmen on shore, seeing the perilous condition of their comrades, sent\r\na basket, with a man in it, down the wire to rescue them from death.\r\nThus, one by one, they were saved. Leaving the Bridge, and proceeding to\r\nthe vicinity of the Whirlpool, still keeping the American side of the\r\nriver, we pitched the camera, not _over_ the precipice, as I heard of\r\none brother photographer doing, but on it, and took a view of the Bridge\r\nand the Rapids looking up towards the Falls, but a bend in the river\r\nprevented them being seen from this point. Not very far above the angry\r\nflood we saw the _Maid of the Mist_ lying quietly at her moorings.\r\n\r\nWe next turned our attention to the great Whirlpool, which is about a\r\nmile below Suspension Bridge. Photographically considered, this is not\r\nnearly of so much interest as the Falls; but it is highly interesting,\r\nnevertheless, as a connecting link between their present and past\r\nhistory. It is supposed that ages ago--probably before the word went\r\nforth, \"Let there _be_ light, and there _was_ light\"--the Falls were as\r\nlow down as the Whirlpool, a distance of over three miles below where\r\nthey now are, or even lower down the river still. Geological observation\r\nalmost proves this; and, that the present Whirlpool was once the great\r\nbasin into which the Falls tumbled. In fact, that this was, in former\r\nages, what the vortex at the foot of the Great Horse Shoe Fall is now.\r\nThere seems to be no doubt whatever that the Falls are gradually though\r\nslowly receding, and they were just as likely to have been at the foot\r\nof the Long Rapids before the deluge, as not; especially when it is\r\nconsidered that the general aspect of the Falls has changed\r\nconsiderably, by gradual undermining of the soft shale and frequent\r\nfalling and settling of the harder rocks during the last fifty years.\r\nLooking at the high and precipitous boundaries of the Long Rapids, it is\r\ndifficult to come to any other conclusion than that, ages before the\r\nred man ever saw the Falls of Niagara, they rolled over a precipice\r\nbetween these rocky barriers in a more compact, but not less majestic\r\nbody. The same vast quantity of water had to force its way through this\r\nnarrower outlet, and it doubtless had a much greater distance to fall,\r\nfor the precipices on each side of the river at this point are nearly\r\n250 feet high, and the width of the gorge for a mile above and below the\r\nWhirlpool is not more than 700 feet. Considering that the Falls are now\r\nspread over an area of nearly three-quarters of a mile, and that this is\r\nthe only outlet for all the superfluous waters of the great inland seas\r\nof Canada and America--Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie--and\r\nthe hundreds of tributaries thereto, it may easily be conceived how\r\ngreat the rush of waters through so narrow a defile must necessarily be;\r\ntheir turbulence and impatience rather aptly reminding you of a spoilt\r\nchild--not in size or form, but in behaviour. They have so long had\r\ntheir own way, and done as they liked on the upper river and at the\r\nFalls, they seem as if they could not brook the restraint put upon them\r\nnow by the giant rocks and lofty precipices that stand erect, on either\r\nside, hurling them back defiantly in tumultuous waves, seething, and\r\nhissing, and roaring in anger, lashing themselves into foam, and\r\nswelling with rage, higher in the middle, as if they sought an\r\nunpolluted way to the lake below, where they might calm their angry and\r\nresentful passions, and lay their chafed heads on the soft and gently\r\nheaving bosom of their lovely sister Ontario. It is a remarkable\r\ncircumstance that the waters of the Rapids, both above and below the\r\nWhirlpool, in this defile are actually higher in the middle, by eight or\r\nnine feet, than at the sides, as if the space afforded them by their\r\nstern sentinels on each side were not enough to allow them to pass\r\nthrough in order and on a level. They seem to come down the upper part\r\nof the gorge like a surging and panic-stricken multitude, until they are\r\nstopped for a time by the gigantic precipice forming the lower boundary\r\nof the Whirlpool, which throws them back, and there they remain whirling\r\nand whirling about until they get away by an under current from the\r\nvortex; and, rising again in the lower part of the gorge, which runs off\r\nat right angles to the upper, they again show their angry heads, and\r\nrush madly and tumultuously away towards Lake Ontario. The bed of these\r\nrapids must be fearfully rugged, or the surface of the waters could not\r\npossibly be in such a broken state, for the water is at least 100 feet\r\ndeep, by measurement made above and below the Rapids. But nobody has\r\nventured to \"heave the lead\" either in the Rapids themselves or in the\r\nWhirlpool, the depth of which is not known. There is not much\r\npicturesque beauty at this point. Indeed, the Whirlpool itself is rather\r\nof a fearful and horrible character, with little to see but the mad\r\ntorrent struggling and writhing in the most furious manner, to force its\r\nway down between its rocky boundaries. I saw logs of wood and other\r\n\"wreck,\" probably portions of canal boats that had come down the river\r\nand been swept over the Falls, whirling around but not coming to the\r\ncentre. When they are seen to get to the vortex they are tipped up\r\nalmost perpendicularly and then vanish from sight, at last released from\r\ntheir continually diminishing and circular imprisonment. It has\r\nsometimes happened that the dead bodies of people drowned in the upper\r\npart of the river have been seen whirling about in this frightful pool\r\nfor many days. In 1841, three soldiers, deserters from the British army,\r\nattempting to swim across the river above these rapids, were drowned.\r\nTheir bodies were carried down to the Whirlpool, where they were seen\r\nwhirling about for nearly a fortnight. Leaving _this_ gloomy and\r\nsoul-depressing locality we proceeded for about half a mile further down\r\nthe river, and visited that frightful chasm called Devil's Hole, or\r\nBloody Run. The former name it takes from a horrible deed of fiendish\r\nand savage ferocity that was committed there by the Indians, and the\r\nlatter name from the circumstance of that deed causing a stream of\r\nhuman blood to run through the ravine and mingle with the fierce water\r\nof the Rapids. Exactly one hundred years ago, during the French and\r\nCanadian wars, a party of 250 officers, men, women, and children, were\r\nretreating from Fort Schlosser, on the Upper Niagara River, and, being\r\ndecoyed into an ambush, were driven over into this dreadful chasm, and\r\nfell to the bottom, a distance of nearly 200 feet. Only two escaped. A\r\ndrummer was caught by one of the trees growing on the side of the\r\nprecipice, and the other, a soldier named Steadman, escaped during the\r\nconflict, at the commencement of the treacherous onslaught. He was\r\nmounted, and the Indians surrounding him, seized the bridle, and were\r\nattempting to drag him off his horse; but, cutting the reins, and giving\r\nhis charger the \"rowels deep,\" the animal dashed forward, and carried\r\nhim back in safety to Fort Schlosser. The Indians afterwards gave him\r\nall the land he encircled in his flight, and he took up his abode among\r\nthem. In after years he put the goats on Goat Island--hence its name--by\r\ndropping carefully down the middle of the upper stream in a boat. After\r\nlanding the goats he returned to the mainland, pushing his boat up the\r\nstream where the Rapids divide, until he reached safe water. The events\r\nof the foregoing episode occurred in 1765, and it is to be hoped that\r\nthe Indians were the chief instigators and perpetrators of the massacre\r\nof Bloody Run.\r\n\r\nWhile we were looking about the chasm to see if there were any fossil\r\nremains in the place, an unlooked-for incident occurred. I saw two men\r\ncoming up from the bottom of the ravine carrying _fish_--and the oddest\r\nfish and the whitest fish I ever saw. The idea of anyone fishing in\r\nthose headlong rapids had never occurred to us; but probably these men\r\nknew some _fissures_ in the rocks where the waters were quiet, and where\r\nthe fish put into as a place of refuge from the stormy waters into which\r\nthey had been drawn. No wonder the poor finny creatures were white, for\r\nI should think they had been frightened almost out of their lives\r\nbefore they were seized by their captors. I don't think I should have\r\nliked to have partaken of the meal they furnished, for they were very\r\n\"shy-an'-hide\" looking fishes. But soon we were obliged to give up both\r\nour geological studies and piscatorial speculations, for black clouds\r\nwere gathering overhead, shutting off the light, and making the dark\r\nravine too gloomy to induce us to prolong our stay in that fearful\r\nchasm, with its melancholy associations of dark deeds of bloodshed and\r\nwholesale murder. Before we gained the road the rain came down, the\r\nlightning flashed, and the thunder clapped, reverberating sharp and loud\r\nfrom the rocks above, and we hurried away from the dismal place. On\r\nreaching the landing stage, we took refuge from the storm and rain by\r\nagain going on board the _Maid of the Mist_. She soon started on her\r\nlast trip for the day, and we reached our hotel, glad to get out of a\r\n\"positive bath,\" and indulge in a \"toning mixture\" of alcohol, sugar,\r\nand _warm_ water. We had no \"_gold_\" but our \"paper\" being _good_, we\r\ndid not require any.\r\n\r\nAfter a delightful sojourn of three weeks at the Falls, and visiting\r\nmany other places of minor interest in their neighbourhood, I bade adieu\r\nto the kind friends I had made and met, with many pleasant recollections\r\nof their kindness, and a never-to-be-forgotten remembrance of the charms\r\nand beauties, mysteries and majesty, power and grandeur, and terror and\r\nsublimity of Niagara.--_Photographic News_, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICTURES OF THE ST. LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\nTaken in Autumn.\r\n\r\nPhotographs of the River St. Lawrence conveying an adequate idea of its\r\nextent and varied aspects, could not be taken in a week, a month, or a\r\nyear. It is only possible in this sketch to call attention to the most\r\nnovel and striking features of this great and interesting river, passing\r\nthem hurriedly, as I did, in the \"express boat,\" by which I sailed from\r\nthe Niagara River to Montreal. Lake Ontario being the great head waters\r\nof the St. Lawrence, and the natural connection between that river and\r\nNiagara, I shall endeavour to illustrate, with pen and pencil, my sail\r\ndown the Niagara River, Lake Ontario, and the St. Lawrence. Stepping on\r\nboard the steamer lying at Lewiston, seven miles below Niagara, and\r\nbound for Montreal, I went to the \"clerk's office,\" paid seven and\r\na half dollars--about thirty shillings sterling--and secured my bed,\r\nboard, and passage for the trip, the above small sum being all that is\r\ncharged for a first-class passage on board those magnificent steamers. I\r\ndon't remember the name of \"our boat,\" but that is of very little\r\nconsequence, though I dare say it was the _Fulton_, that being in\r\nsteamboat nomenclature what \"Washington\" is to men, cities, and towns,\r\nand even territory, in America. But she was a splendid vessel,\r\nnevertheless, with a handsome dining saloon, a fine upper saloon running\r\nthe whole length of the upper deck, about two hundred feet, an elegant\r\n\"ladies' saloon,\" a stateroom cabin as well, and a powerful \"walking\r\nengine.\" \"All aboard,\" and \"let go;\" splash went the paddle-wheels, and\r\nwe moved off majestically, going slowly down the river until we passed\r\nFort Niagara on the American side, and Fort George on the British, at\r\nthe foot of the river, and near the entrance to the Lake. On Fort\r\nNiagara the \"Star Spangled Banner\" was floating, its bright blue field\r\nblending with the clear blue sky of an autumn afternoon, its starry\r\nrepresentatives of each State shining like stars in the deep blue vault\r\nof heaven, its red and white bars, thirteen in number, as pure in colour\r\nas the white clouds and crimson streaks of the west. The mingled crosses\r\nof St. Andrew and St. George were waving proudly over the fort opposite.\r\nBrave old flag, long may you wave! These forts played their respective\r\nparts amidst the din of battle during the wars of 1812 and 1813; but\r\nwith these we have neither time nor inclination to deal; we, like the\r\nwaters of the Niagara, are in a hurry to reach the bosom of Lake\r\nOntario. Passing the forts, we were soon on the expanse of waters, and\r\nbeing fairly \"at sea,\" we began to settle ourselves and \"take stock,\" as\r\nit were, of our fellow travellers. It is useless to describe the aspect\r\nof the Lake; I might as well describe the German Ocean, for I could not\r\nsee much difference between that and Lake Ontario, except that I could\r\nnot sniff the iodine from the weeds drying in the sun while we \"hugged\r\nthe shore,\" or taste salt air after we were out in mid ocean--\"the land\r\nis no longer in view.\"\r\n\r\nTo be at sea is to be at sea, no matter whether it is on a fresh water\r\nocean or a salt one. The sights, the sensations, and consequences are\r\nmuch the same. There, a ship or two in full sail; here, a passenger or\r\ntwo, of both sexes, with the \"wind taken out of their sails.\" The \"old\r\nsalts\" or \"old freshes\" behave themselves much as usual, and so do the\r\n\"green\" ones of both atmospheres--the latter by preparing for a \"bath\"\r\nof perspiration and throwing everything down the \"sink,\" or into the\r\nsea; and the former by picking out companions for the voyage. Being\r\nmyself an \"old salt,\" and tumbling in with one or two of a \"fellow\r\nfeeling wondrous kind,\" we were soon on as good terms as if we had known\r\neach other for years. After \"supper,\" a sumptuous repast at 6 p.m., we\r\nwent on to the \"hurricane deck\" to enjoy the calm and pleasant evening\r\noutside. There was a \"gentle swell\" on the Lake--not much, but enough to\r\nupset a few. After dark, we went into the \"ladies' cabin\"--an elegant\r\nsaloon, beautifully furnished, and not without a grand piano, where the\r\n\"old freshes\" of the softer sex--young and pretty ones too--were amusing\r\nthemselves with playing and singing. An impromptu concert was soon\r\nformed, and a few very good pieces of music well played and sung. All\r\nwent off very well while nothing but English, or, I should more properly\r\nsay, American and Canadian, were sung, but one young lady,\r\nunfortunately, essayed one of the sweetest and most plaintive of Scotch\r\nsongs--\"Annie Laurie.\" Now fancy the love-sick \"callant\" for the sake of\r\nAnnie Laurie lying down to _die_; just fancy Annie Laurie without the\r\nScotch; only fancy Annie Laurie in a sort of mixture of Canadianisms and\r\nAmericanisms; fancy \"toddy\" without the whisky, and you have some idea\r\nof \"Annie Laurie\" as sung on board the _Fulton_ while splashing away on\r\nLake Ontario, somewhere between America and Canada. There being little\r\nmore to induce us to remain there, and by the ship's regulations it was\r\ngetting near the time for \"all lights out\" in the cabins, we took an\r\nearly \"turn in,\" with the view of making an early \"turn-out,\" so as to\r\nbe alive and about when we should enter the St. Lawrence, which we did\r\nat 6 o'clock a.m., on a fine bright morning, the sun just rising to\r\nlight up and \"heighten\" all the glorious tints of the trees on the\r\nThousand and One Islands, among which we were now sailing.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to form a correct idea of the width of the St. Lawrence\r\nat the head of the river. The islands are so large and numerous, it is\r\ndifficult to come to a conclusion whether you are on a river or on a\r\nlake. Many of these islands are thickly wooded, so that they look more\r\nlike the mainland on each side of you as the steamer glides down \"mid\r\nchannel\" between them. The various and brilliant tints of the foliage of\r\nthe trees of America in autumn are gorgeous, such as never can be seen\r\nin this country; and their \"chromotones\" present an insurmountable\r\ndifficulty to a photographer with his double achromatic lens and camera.\r\nImagine our oaks clothed with leaves possessing all the varieties of red\r\ntints, from brilliant carmine down to burnt sienna--the brightest copper\r\nbays that grow in England are cool in tone compared with them; fancy our\r\nbeeches, birches, and ashes thick with leaves of a bright yellow colour,\r\nfrom gamboge down to yellow ochre; our pines, firs, larches, and\r\nspruces, carrying all the varieties of green, from emerald down to terra\r\nverte; in fact, all the tints that are, can be seen on the trees when\r\nthey are going into \"the sere and yellow leaf\" of autumn, excepting\r\n_blue_, and even that is supplied by the bluebirds (Sialia wilsonii)\r\nflitting about among the leaves, and in the deep cool tint of the sky,\r\nrepeated and blended with the reflection of the many-coloured trees in\r\nthe calm, still water of the river. Some of the trees--the maples, for\r\ninstance--exhibit in themselves, most vividly, the brightest shades of\r\nred, green, and yellow; but when the wind blows these resplendent\r\ncolours about, the atmosphere is like a mammoth kaleidoscope that is\r\nnever allowed to rest long enough to present to the eye a symmetrical\r\nfigure or pattern, a perfect chaos of the most vivid and brilliant\r\ncolours too gorgeous to depict. Long before this we had got clear of the\r\nislands at the foot of the lake and head of the river, and were steaming\r\nswiftly down the broad St. Lawrence. It is difficult to say how broad,\r\nbut it varied from three to five or six miles in width; indeed, the\r\nriver very much resembles the Balloch End, which is the broadest of\r\nLochlomond; and some of the passages between the islands are very\r\nsimilar to the straits between the \"Pass of Balmaha\" and the island of\r\nInchcailliach. The river is not hemmed in with such mountains as Ben\r\nLomond and Ben Dhu, but, in many respects, the St. Lawrence very much\r\nresembles parts of our widest lakes, Lochlomond and Windermere. Having\r\nenjoyed the sight of the bright, beautiful scenery and the fresh morning\r\nair for a couple of hours, we were summoned to breakfast by the sound of\r\nthe steward's \"Big Ben.\" Descending to the lower cabin, we seated\r\nourselves at the breakfast table, and partook of a most hearty meal. All\r\nthe meals on board these steamers are served in the most sumptuous\r\nstyle. During the repast some talked politics, some dollars and cents,\r\nothers were speculating on how we should get down the Rapids, and when\r\nwe should make them. Among the latter was myself, for I had seen rapids\r\nwhich I had not the slightest desire to be in or on; and, what sort of\r\nrapids we were coming to was of some importance to all who had not been\r\non them. But everybody seemed anxious to be \"on deck,\" and again \"look\r\nout\" for the quickening of the stream, or when the first \"white\r\nlippers,\" should give indication of their whereabouts. My fellow\r\npassengers were from all parts of the Union; the Yankee \"guessed,\" the\r\nSoutherner \"reckoned,\" and the Western man \"calculated\" we should soon\r\nbe among the \"jumpers.\" Each one every now and then strained his eyes\r\n\"ahead,\" down stream, to see if he could descry \"broken water.\" At last\r\nan old river-man sung out, \"There they are.\" There are the Longue Sault\r\nRapids, the first we reach. Having plenty of \"daylight,\" we did not feel\r\nmuch anxiety as we neared them, which we quickly did, for \"the stream\r\nruns fast.\" We were soon among the jumping waters, and it is somewhat\r\ndifficult to describe the sensation, somewhat difficult to find a\r\ncomparison of a suitable character. It is not like being at sea in a\r\nship in a \"dead calm.\" The vessel does not \"roll\" with such solemn\r\ndignity, nor does she \"pitch\" and rise again so buoyantly as an Atlantic\r\nsteamer (strange enough, I once crossed the Atlantic in the steamship\r\n_Niagara_), as she ploughs her way westward or eastward in a \"head\r\nwind,\" and through a head sea. She rather kicks and jerks, and is let\r\n\"down a peg\" or two, with a shake and a fling. Did you ever ride a\r\nspavined horse down a hill? If so, you can form some idea of the manner\r\nin which we were let down the Longue Sault and Cedar Rapids and the St.\r\nLouis Cascades. One of our fellow passengers--a Scotchman--told that\r\nsomewhat _apropos_ and humorous story of the \"Hielandman's\" first trip\r\nacross the Firth of Forth in a \"nasty sea.\" Feeling a little uneasy\r\nabout the stomach, and his bile being rather disturbed, the prostrate\r\nmountaineer cried out to the man at the \"tiller\" to \"stop tickling the\r\nbeast's tail--what was he making the animal kick that way for?\" And so,\r\ntelling our stories, and cracking our jokes, we spent the time until our\r\nswift vessel brought us to a landing, where we leave her and go on board\r\na smaller boat, one more suitable for the descent of the more dangerous\r\nrapids, which we have yet to come to.\r\n\r\n\"All aboard,\" and away we go again as fast as steam and a strong current\r\ncan take us, passing an island here and there, a town or a village half\r\nFrench and English, with a sprinkling of the Indian tribes, on the banks\r\nof the river now and then. But by this time it is necessary to go below\r\nagain and dine. Bed, board, and travelling, are all included in the\r\nfare, so everyone goes to dinner. There is, however, so much to see\r\nduring this delightful trip, that nobody likes to be below any longer\r\nthan can be avoided. Immediately after dinner most are on deck again,\r\nanxious to see all that is to be seen on this magnificent river. The\r\nsights are various and highly interesting to the mind or \"objectives\" of\r\neither artist or photographer. Perhaps one of the most novel subjects\r\nfor the camera and a day's photographing would be \"Life on a Raft,\" as\r\nyou see them drifting down the St. Lawrence. There is an immense raft--a\r\nlong, low, flat, floating island, studded with twenty or thirty sails,\r\nand half a dozen huts, peopled with men, women, and children, the little\r\nones playing about as if they were on a \"plank road,\" or in a garden. It\r\nis \"washing day,\" and the clean clothes are drying in the sun and\r\nbreeze--indicative of the strictest domestic economy, and scrupulous\r\ncleanliness of those little huts, the many-coloured garments giving the\r\nraft quite a gay appearance, as if it were decked with the \"flags of all\r\nnations.\" But what a life of tedious monotony it must be, drifting down\r\nthe river in this way for hundreds of miles, from the upper part of Lake\r\nOntario to Montreal or Quebec. How they get down the rapids of the St.\r\nLawrence I do not know, but I should think they run considerable risk of\r\nbeing washed off; the raft seems too low in the water, and if not\r\nextremely well fastened, might part and be broken up. We passed two or\r\nthree of these rafts, one a very large one, made up of thousands of\r\ntimbers laid across and across like warp and weft; yet the people seemed\r\nhappy enough on these \"timber islands;\" we passed them near enough to\r\nsee their faces and hear their voices, and I regretted I could not\r\n\"catch their shadows,\" or stop and have an hour or two's work among them\r\nwith the camera or the pencil; but we passed them by as if they were a\r\nfixture in the river, and they gave us a shout of \"God speed,\" as if\r\nthey did not envy our better pace in the least.\r\n\r\nThere is abundance of work for the camera at all times of the year on\r\nthe St. Lawrence; I have seen it in summer and autumn, and have\r\nattempted to describe some of its attractions. And I was told that when\r\nthe river--not the rapids--is ice-bound, the banks covered with snow,\r\nand the trees clad in icicles, they present a beautiful scene in the\r\nsunshine. And in the spring, when the ice is breaking up, and the floes\r\npiling high on one another, it is a splendid sight to see them coming\r\ndown, hurled about and smashed in the rapids, showing that the water in\r\nits liquid state is by far the most powerful. But now we are coming to\r\nthe most exciting part of our voyage. The steam is shut off, the engine\r\nmotionless, the paddle-wheels are still, and we are gliding swiftly and\r\nnoiselessly down with the current. Yonder speck on the waters is the\r\nIndian coming in his canoe to pilot us down the dangerous rapids. We\r\nnear each other, and he can now be seen paddling swiftly, and his canoe\r\nshoots like an arrow towards us. Now he is alongside, he leaps lightly\r\non board, his canoe is drawn up after him, and he takes command of the\r\n\"boat.\" Everybody on board knows the critical moment is approaching. The\r\npassengers gather \"forward,\" the ladies cling to the arms of their\r\nnatural protectors, conversation is stopped, the countenances of\r\neveryone exhibit intense excitement and anxiety, and every eye is \"fixed\r\nahead,\" or oscillating between the pilot and the rushing waters which\r\ncan now be seen from the prow of the vessel. The Indian and three other\r\nmen are at the wheel in the \"pilot house,\" holding the helm \"steady,\"\r\nand we are rushing down the stream unaided by any other propelling power\r\nthan the force of the current, at a rate of twenty miles an hour. Now we\r\nhear the rushing and plunging sound of the waters, and in a moment the\r\nkeen eye of the Indian catches sight of the land mark, which is the\r\nsignal for putting the helm \"hard a port;\" the wheel flies round like\r\nlightning, and we are instantly dropped down a perpendicular fall of ten\r\nor twelve feet, the vessel careening almost on her \"beam ends,\" in the\r\nmidst of these wild, white waters, an immense rock or rocky island right\r\nahead. But that is safely \"rounded,\" and we are again in comparatively\r\nquiet water. The steam is turned into the cylinders, and we go on our\r\ncourse in a sober, sensible, and steamboat-like fashion. When we were\r\nsafely past the rapids and round the rock, a gentleman remarked to me\r\nthat \"once in a lifetime was enough of that.\" It was interesting to\r\nwatch the countenances of the passengers, and mark the difference of\r\nexpression before and after the passage of the rapids. Before, it was\r\nall excitement and anxiety, mingled with a wish-it-was-over sort of\r\nlook; and all were silent. After, everybody laughed and talked, and\r\nseemed delighted at having passed the _Lachine_ Rapids in safety; yet\r\nmost people are anxious to undergo the excitement and incur the risk and\r\ndanger of the passage. You can, if you like, leave the boat above\r\nLachine and proceed to Montreal by the cars, but I don't think any of\r\nour numerous passengers ever thought of doing such a thing. As long as\r\never this magnificent water way is free from ice, and the passage can be\r\nmade, it is done. I don't know that more than one accident has ever\r\noccurred, but the risk seems considerable. There is a very great strain\r\non the tiller ropes, and if one of them were to \"give out\" at the\r\ncritical time, nothing could save the vessel from being dashed to pieces\r\nagainst the \"rock ahead,\" and scarcely a life could be saved. No one can\r\napproach the spot except from above, and then there is no stopping to\r\nhelp others; you must go with the waters, rushing madly down over and\r\namong the rocks. The Indians often took these rapids, in their canoes,\r\nto descend to the lower part of the St. Lawrence; and one of them\r\nundertook to pilot the first steamer down in safety. His effort was\r\nsuccessful, and he secured for his tribe (the Iroquois) a charter\r\nendowing them with the privileges and emoluments in perpetuity. I wish I\r\ncould have obtained photographic impressions of these scenes and groups,\r\nbut the only lens I could draw a \"focus\" with was the eye, and the only\r\n\"plate\" I had ready for use was the _retina_. However, the impressions\r\nobtained on that were so \"vigorous and well-defined,\" I can at any\r\nmoment call them up, like \"spirits from the vasty deep,\" and reproduce\r\nthem in my mental camera.\r\n\r\nThe remaining nine miles of the voyage were soon accomplished. Passing\r\nthe first abutment of the Victoria Bridge, which now crosses the St.\r\nLawrence, at this point two miles wide, we quickly reached the fine quay\r\nand canal locks at Montreal, where we landed just as it was growing\r\ndark, after a delightful and exciting voyage of about thirty hours'\r\nduration, and a distance of more than four hundred miles. Quick work;\r\nbut it must be borne in mind how much our speed was accelerated by the\r\nvelocity of the current, and that the return trip by the canal, past the\r\nrapids, cannot be performed in anything like the time.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the quay I parted with my agreeable fellow travellers, and\r\nsought an hotel, where once more, after a long interval, I slept under a\r\nroof over which floated the flag which every Englishman is proud of--the\r\nUnion Jack.\r\n\r\nNext morning I rose early, and, with a photographic eye, scanned the\r\ncity of Montreal. The streets are narrow, but clean, and well built of\r\nstone. Most of the suburban streets and villa residences are \"frame\r\nbuildings,\" but there are many handsome villas of stone about the base\r\nof the \"mountain.\" I visited the principal buildings and the Cathedral\r\nof Notre Dame, ascended to the top of the Bell Tower, looked down upon\r\nthe city, and had a fine view of its splendid quays and magnificent\r\nriver frontage, and across the country southwards for a great distance,\r\nas far as the Adirondack Mountains, where the Hudson River bubbles into\r\nexistence at Hendrick Spring, whence it creeps and gathers strength as\r\nit glides and falls and rushes alternately until it enters the Atlantic\r\nbelow New York, over three hundred miles south of its source. But the\r\nmountain at the back of Montreal prevented my seeing anything beyond the\r\ncity in that direction. I afterwards ascended the mountain, from the\r\nsummit of which I could see an immense distance up the river, far beyond\r\nLachine, and across the St. Lawrence, and southwards into the \"States.\"\r\nBeing homeward bound, and having no desire at that time to prolong my\r\nstay in the western hemisphere, I did not wait to obtain any photographs\r\nof Montreal or the neighbourhood; but, taking ship for old England, I\r\nleave the lower St. Lawrence and its beauties; Quebec, with its glorious\r\nassociations of Wolfe and the plains of Abraham, its fortifications,\r\nwhich are now being so fully described and discussed in the House of\r\nCommons, and the Gulf of the St. Lawrence, where vessels have sometimes\r\nto be navigated from the \"masthead,\" in consequence of the low-lying sea\r\nfog which frequently prevails there. A man is sent up \"aloft\" where he\r\ncan see over the fog, which lies like a stratum of white cloud on the\r\ngulf, and pilot the ship safely through the fleet of merchantmen which\r\nare constantly sailing up and down while the river is open. The fog may\r\nnot be much above the \"maintop,\" but is so dense it is impossible to see\r\nbeyond the end of the \"bowsprit\" from the deck of the ship you are\r\naboard; but from the \"masthead\" the \"look-out\" can see the highland and\r\nthe masts and sails of the other ships, and avoid the danger of going\r\n\"ashore\" or coming into collision by crying out to the man at the wheel\r\nsuch sea phrases as \"Port,\" \"Starboard,\" \"Steady,\" &c.; and when\r\n\"tacking\" up or down the gulf, such as \"luff,\" \"higher,\" \"let her off.\"\r\nIndeed, the whole trip of the St. Lawrence--from Lake Ontario to the\r\nAtlantic--is intensely exciting. While off the coast of Newfoundland, I\r\nwitnessed one of those beautiful sights of nature in her sternest mood,\r\nwhich I think has yet to be rendered in the camera--icebergs in the\r\nsunlight. A great deal has been said about their beauty and colour, but\r\nnothing too much. Anyone who saw Church's picture of \"The Icebergs,\"\r\nexhibited in London last year, may accept that as a faithful reflection\r\nof all their beautiful colours and dreadful desolation. All sailors like\r\nto give them as wide a \"berth\" as possible, and never admire their\r\nbeauty, but shun them for their treachery. Sometimes their base extends\r\nfar beyond their perpendicular lines, and many a good ship has struck on\r\nthe shoal of ice under water, when the Captain thought he was far enough\r\naway from it. The largest one I saw was above a hundred feet above the\r\nwater-line, and as they never exhibit more than one-third of their\r\nponderous mass of frozen particles, there would be over two hundred feet\r\nof it below water, probably shoaling far out in all directions. We had a\r\nquick run across the Atlantic, and I landed in Liverpool, in the month\r\nof November, amid fog, and smoke, and gloom. What a contrast in the\r\nlight! Here it was all fog and darkness, and photography impossible.\r\nThere--on the other side of the waters--the light is always abundant\r\nboth in winter and summer; and it is only during a snow or rain storm\r\nthat our transatlantic brother photographers are brought to a\r\nstandstill.--_Photographic News_, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHIC IMPRESSIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson, Developed on the Voyage.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have a trip up the Hudson,\" said a friend of mine, one of the\r\nbest operators in New York; \"we'll have a trip up the Hudson, and go and\r\nspend a few days with the 'old folk' in Vermont, and then you will see\r\nus 'Yankees'--our homes and hospitalities--in a somewhat different light\r\nfrom what you see them in this Gotham.\"\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged, and on the day appointed we walked down Broadway,\r\nturned down Courtland Street to the North River, and went on board the\r\nsplendid river steamer _Isaac Newton_, named, in graceful compliment,\r\nafter one of England's celebrities. Two dollars (eight and fourpence)\r\neach secured us a first-class passage in one of those floating palaces,\r\nfor a trip of 144 miles up one of the most picturesque rivers in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nWishing for a thorough change of scene and occupation, and being tired\r\nof \"posing and arranging lights\" and \"drawing a focus\" on the faces of\r\nmen, women, and children in a stifling and pent-up city, we left the\r\ncamera with its \"racks and pinions\" behind, determined to revel in the\r\nbeautiful and lovely only of nature, and breathe the fresh and\r\nexhilarating air as we steamed up the river, seated at the prow, and\r\nfanned by the breeze freshened by the speed of our swift-sailing boat.\r\n\r\nLeaving New York, with its hundred piers jutting out into the broad\r\nstream, and its thousand masts and church spires on the one side, and\r\nJersey City on the other, we are soon abreast of Hoboken and the\r\n\"Elysian Fields,\" where the Germans assemble to drink \"lager beer\" and\r\nspend their Sundays and holidays. On the right or east side of the river\r\nis Spuyten Duyvil Creek, which forms a junction with the waters of the\r\nSound or East River, and separates the tongue of land on which New York\r\nstands from the main, making the island of Manhattan. This island is a\r\nlittle over thirteen miles long and two and a half miles wide. The Dutch\r\nbought the whole of it for L4 16s., and that contemptible sum was not\r\npaid to the poor, ignorant, and confiding Indians in hard cash, but in\r\ntoys and trumpery articles not worth half the money. Truly it may be\r\nsaid that the \"Empire City\" of the United States did not cost a cent. an\r\nacre not more than two hundred and fifty years ago, and now some parts\r\nof it are worth a dollar a square foot. At Spuyten Duyvil Creek Henry\r\nHudson had a skirmish with the Indians, while his ship, the _Half Moon_,\r\nwas lying at anchor.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the picturesque and the beautiful, subjects fit for the\r\ncamera of the photographer, the pencil of the artist, and the pen of the\r\nhistorian. On the western side of the Hudson, above Hoboken, we catch\r\nthe first glimpse of that singular and picturesque natural river wall\r\ncalled the \"Palisades,\" a series of bold and lofty escarpments,\r\nextending for about thirty-five miles up the river, and varying in an\r\nalmost perpendicular height from four to over six hundred feet, portions\r\nof them presenting a very similar appearance to Honister Craig, facing\r\nthe Vale of Buttermere and Salisbury Craigs, near Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nAbout two and a half miles above Manhattan Island, on the east bank of\r\nthe Hudson, I noticed a castellated building of considerable\r\npretensions, but somewhat resembling one of those stage scenes of\r\nDunsinane in _Macbeth_, or the Castle of Ravenswood in the _Bride of\r\nLammermoor_. On enquiring to whom this fortified-looking residence\r\nbelonged, I was told it was Fort Hill, the retreat of Edwin Forest, the\r\ncelebrated American tragedian. It is built of blue granite, and must\r\nhave been a costly fancy.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the pretty village of Yonkers, where there are plenty of\r\nsubjects for the camera, on Sawmill River, and the hills behind the\r\nvillage. Here, off Yonkers, in 1609, Henry Hudson came to the premature\r\nconclusion, from the strong tidal current, that he had discovered the\r\nnorth-west passage, which was the primary object of his voyage, and\r\nwhich led to the discovery of the river which now bears his name.\r\n\r\nAt Dobb's Ferry there is not much to our liking; but passing that, and\r\nbefore reaching Tarrytown, we are within the charming atmosphere of\r\nSunnyside, where Washington Irving lived and wrote many of his\r\ndelightful works. Tarrytown is the next place we make, and here, during\r\nthe war for independence, the enthusiastic but unfortunate soldier,\r\nMajor Andre, was captured; and at Tappan, nearly opposite, he was hung\r\nas a spy on the 2nd of October, 1780.\r\n\r\nAll the world knows the unfortunate connection between Benedict Arnold,\r\nthe American traitor, and Major Andre, the frank, gallant, and\r\nenterprising British officer; so I shall leave those subjects to the\r\nstudents of history, and pass on as fast as our boat will carry us to\r\nthe next place of note on the east bank of the river, Sing Sing, which\r\nis the New York State prison, where the refractory and not over honest\r\nmembers of State society are sent to be \"operated\" upon by the salutary\r\ntreatment of confinement and employment. Some of them are \"doing time\"\r\nin _dark rooms_, which are very unsuitable for photographic operations,\r\nand where _a little more light_, no matter how yellow or non-actinic,\r\nwould be gladly received. The \"silent cell\" system is not practised so\r\nmuch in this State as in some of the others; but the authorities do\r\ntheir best to _improve the negative_ or refractory character of the\r\n_subjects_ placed under their care. It is, however, very questionable\r\nwhether their efforts are not entirely _negatived_, and the bad\r\ncharacter of the subject more _fully developed_ and _intensified_ by\r\ncontact with the more powerful _reducing agents_ by which they are\r\nsurrounded. Their prison is, however, very pleasantly situated on the\r\nbanks of the Hudson, about thirty-three miles above New York City.\r\n\r\nOpposite Sing Sing is Rockland Lake, one hundred and fifty feet above\r\nthe river, at the back of the Palisades. This lake is celebrated for\r\nthree things--leeches and water lilies in summer, and ice in winter.\r\nRockland Lake ice is prized by the thirsty denizens of New York City in\r\nthe sultry summer months, and even in this country it is becoming known\r\nas a cooler and \"refresher.\"\r\n\r\nNearly opposite Sing Sing is the boldest and highest buttress of the\r\nPalisades; it is called \"Vexatious Point,\" and stands six hundred and\r\nsixty feet above the water.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven miles above Sing Sing we come to Peekskill, which is at the\r\nfoot of the Peekskill Mountains. Backed up by those picturesque hills it\r\nhas a pretty appearance from the river. This was also a very important\r\nplace during the wars. At this point the Americans set fire to a small\r\nfleet rather than let it fall into the hands of the British.\r\n\r\nA little higher up on the west side is the important military station of\r\nWest Point. This place, as well as being most charmingly situated, is\r\nalso famous as the great military training school of the United States.\r\nProbably you have noticed, in reading the accounts of the war now raging\r\nbetween North and South, that this or that general or officer was a\r\n\"West Point man.\" General George M'Clellan received his military\r\neducation at West Point; but, whatever military knowledge he gained at\r\nthis college, strengthened by experience and observation at the Crimea,\r\nhe was not allowed to make much use of while he held command of the army\r\nof the Potomac. His great opponent, General Lee, was also a \"West Point\r\nman,\" and it does not require much consideration to determine which of\r\nthe \"Pointsmen\" was the smarter. Washington has also made West Point\r\nfamous in the time of the war for independence. Benedict Arnold held\r\ncommand of this point and other places in the neighbourhood, when he\r\nmade overtures to Sir Henry Clinton to hand over to the British, for a\r\npecuniary consideration of L10,000, West Point and all its outposts.\r\n\r\nA little higher up is Cold Spring, on the east side of the Hudson; but\r\nwe will pass that by, and now we are off Newburg on the west bank. This\r\nis a large and flourishing town also at the foot of high hills--indeed,\r\nwe are now in the highlands of the Hudson, and it would be difficult to\r\nfind a town or a village that is not _backed up_ by hills. At the time I\r\nfirst visited these scenes there was a large photographic apparatus\r\nmanufactory at Newburg, where they made \"coating boxes,\" \"buff wheels,\"\r\n\"Pecks blocks,\" &c., on a very extensive scale, for the benefit of\r\nthemselves and all who were interested in the \"cleaning,\" \"buffing,\" and\r\n\"coating\" of Daguerreotype plates.\r\n\r\nOpposite Newburg is Fishkill; but we shall pass rapidly up past\r\nPoughkeepsie on the right, and other places right and left, until we\r\ncome to Hudson, on the east side of the river. Opposite Hudson are the\r\nCatskill Mountains, and here the river is hemmed in by mountains on all\r\nsides, resembling the head of Ullswater lake, or the head of Loch Lomond\r\nor Loch Katrine; and here we have a photographic curiosity to descant\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nDown through the gorges of these mountains came a blast like the sound\r\nfrom a brazen trumpet, which electrified the photographers of the day.\r\nAmong these hills resided the Rev. Levi Hill, who lately died in New\r\nYork, the so-called inventor or discoverer of the Hillotype, or\r\nDaguerreotypes in natural colours. So much were the \"Daguerreans\" of New\r\nYork startled by the announcement of this wonderful discovery, that they\r\nformed themselves into a sort of company to buy up the _highly coloured_\r\ninvention. A deputation of some of the most respectable and influential\r\nDaguerreotypists of New York was appointed to wait upon the reverend\r\ndiscoverer, and offer him I don't remember how many thousand dollars for\r\nhis discovery as it stood; and it is said that he showed them specimens\r\nof \"coloured Daguerreotypes,\"--but refused to sell or impart to them the\r\nsecret until he had completed his discovery, and made it perfect by\r\nworking out the mode of producing the only lacking colour, chrome\r\nyellow. But in that he never succeeded, and so this wonderful discovery\r\nwas neither given nor sold to the world. Many believed the truth of the\r\nman's statements--whether he believed it himself or not, God only knows.\r\nOne skilful Daguerreotypist, in the State of New York, assured me he had\r\nseen the specimens, and had seen the rev. gentleman at work in his\r\nlaboratory labouring and \"buffing\" away at a mass of something like a\r\npiece of lava, until by dint of hard rubbing and scrubbing the colours\r\nwere said to \"appear like spirits,\" one by one, until all but the\r\nstubborn chrome yellow showed themselves on the surface. I could not\r\nhelp laughing at my friend's statement and evident credulity, but after\r\nseeing \"jumping Quakers,\" disciples of Joe Smith, and believers in the\r\ndoctrine of Johanna Southcote, I could not be much surprised at any\r\ncreed either in art or religion, or that men should fall into error in\r\nthe Hillotype faith as easily as into errors of ethics or morality. I\r\nwas assured by my friend (not my travelling companion) that they were\r\nbeautiful specimens of colouring. Granted; but that did not prove that\r\nthey were not done by hand. Indeed, a suspicion got abroad that the\r\nspecimens shown by Mr. Hill were _hand-coloured_ pictures brought from\r\nEurope. And from all that I could learn they were more like the\r\nbeautifully coloured Daguerreotypes of M. Mansion, who was then\r\ncolourist to Mr. Beard, than anything else I could see or hear of. Being\r\nno mean hand myself at colouring a Daguerreotype in those days, I was\r\nmost anxious to see one of those wonderful specimens of \"photography in\r\nnatural colours,\" but I never could; and the inventor lived in such an\r\nout-of-the way place, among the Catskills, that I had no opportunity of\r\npaying him a visit. I have every reason to believe that the\r\nhand-coloured pictures by M. Mansion and myself were the only Hillotypes\r\nthat were ever exhibited in America. Many of my coloured Daguerreotypes\r\nwere exhibited at the State Fair in Castle Garden, and at the Great\r\nExhibition at New York in 1853. But perhaps the late Rev. Levi Hill was\r\ndesirous of securing a posthumous fame, and may have left something\r\nbehind him after all; for surely, no man in his senses would have made\r\nsuch a noise about Daguerreotypes in \"natural colours\" as he did if he\r\nhad not some reason for doing so. If so, and if he has left anything\r\nbehind him that will lead us into nature's hidden mine of natural\r\ncolours, now is the time for the \"heirs and administrators\" of the\r\ndeceased gentlemen to secure for their deceased relative a fame as\r\nenduring as the Catskill Mountains themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Katzbergs, as the Dutch called the Catskill Mountains, on account of\r\nthe number of wild cats they found among them, have more than a\r\nphotographic interest. The late Washington Irving has imparted to them\r\nan attraction of a romantic character almost as bewitching as that\r\nconferred upon the mountains in the vicinity of Loch Lomond and Loch\r\nKatrine by Sir Walter Scott. It is true that the delicate fancy of\r\nIrving has not peopled the Katzbergs with such \"warriors true\" as stood\r\n\r\n    \"Along Benledi's living side;\"\r\n\r\nnor has he \"sped the fiery cross\" over \"dale, glen, and valley;\" neither\r\nhas he tracked\r\n\r\n    \"The antler'd monarch of the waste\"\r\n\r\nfrom hill to hill; but the war-whoop of the Mohegans has startled the\r\nwild beasts from their lair, and the tawny hunters of the tribe have\r\nfollowed up the trail of the panther until with bow and arrow swift they\r\nhave slain him in his mountain hiding place. And Irving's quaint fancy\r\nhas re-peopled the mountains again with the phantom figures of Hendrick\r\nHudson and his crew, and put Rip van Winkle to sleep, like a big baby,\r\nin one of nature's huge cradles, where he slept for _twenty years_, and\r\nslept away the reign of good King George III. over the colonies, and\r\nawoke to find himself a bewildered citizen of the United States of\r\nAmerica. And the place where he slept, and the place where he saw the\r\nsolemn, silent crew of the \"Half Moon\" playing at ninepins, will be\r\nsought for and pointed out in all time coming. And why should these\r\nscenes of natural beauty and charming romance not be photographed on the\r\nspot? It has not been done to my knowledge, yet they are well worthy the\r\nattention of photographers, either amateur or professional. We leave the\r\nCatskill Mountains with some regret, because of the disappointment of\r\ntheir not yielding us the promised triumph of chemistry, \"photography in\r\nnatural colours,\" and because of their beauty and varying effects of\r\n_chiaroscuro_ not having been sufficiently rendered in the monochromes\r\nwe have so long had an opportunity of obtaining in the camera.\r\n\r\nPassing Coxsackie, on the west bank of the Hudson, and many pleasant\r\nresidences and places on each side of the river, we are soon at Albany,\r\nthe capital of the State of New York, and the termination of our voyage\r\non board the _Isaac Newton_. And well had our splendid steamer performed\r\nher part of the contract. Here we were, in ten hours, at Albany, 144\r\nmiles from New York City. What a contrast, in the rate of speed, between\r\nthe _Isaac Newton_ and the first boat that steamed up the Hudson! The\r\n_Claremont_ took over thirty-six hours, wind and weather permitting, to\r\nperform the voyage between New York and Albany; and we had done it in\r\nten. What a contrast, too, in the size, style, and deportment of the\r\ntwo boats! The _Claremont_ was a little, panting, puffing, half-clad,\r\nalways-out-of-breath sort of thing, that splashed and struggled\r\nand groaned through the water, and threw its naked and diminutive\r\npaddle-wheels in and out of the river--like a man that can neither\r\nswim nor is willing to be drowned, throwing his arms in and out of the\r\nwater in agony--and only reached her destination after a number of\r\nstoppings-to-breathe and spasmodic start-agains. The _Isaac Newton_\r\nhad glided swiftly and smoothly through the waters of the Hudson, her\r\ngigantic paddle-wheels performing as many revolutions in a minute as\r\nthe other's did in twenty.\r\n\r\nBut these were the advanced strides and improvements brought about by\r\nthe workings and experiences of half a century. If the marine steam\r\nengine be such a wonderfully-improved machine in that period of time,\r\nwhat may not photography be when the art-science is fifty years old?\r\nWhat have not the thousands of active brains devoted to its advancement\r\ndone for it already? What have not been the improvements and wonderful\r\nworkings of photography in a quarter of a century? What improvements\r\nhave not been effected in the lifetime of any old Daguerreotypist?\r\nWhen I first knew photography it was a ghostly thing--a shimmering\r\nphantom--that was flashed in and out of your eyes with the rapidity of\r\nlightning, as you tried to catch a sight of the image between the total\r\ndarkness of the black polish of the silvered plate, and the blinding\r\nlight of the sky, which was reflected as from a mirror into your eyes.\r\n\r\nBut how these phantom figures vanished! How rapidly they changed from\r\nghostly and almost invisible shadows to solid, visible, and all but\r\ntangible forms under the magical influence of Goddard's and Claudet's\r\n\"bromine accelerator,\" and Fizeau's \"fixing\" or gilding process! How\r\nMercury flew to the lovely and joint creations of chemistry and optics,\r\nand took kindly to the timid, hiding beauties of Iodine, Bromine,\r\nSilver, and Light, and brought them out, and showed them to the world,\r\nproudly, as \"things of beauty,\" and \"a joy for ever!\" How Mercury clung\r\nto these latent beauties, and \"developed\" their charms, and became\r\n\"attached\" to them, and almost immovable; and consented, at last, to be\r\ntinted like a Gibson's Venus to enhance the charms and witcheries of his\r\nproteges! Anon was Mercury driven from Beauty's fair domain, and bright\r\nshining Silver, in another form, took up with two fuming, puffy fellows,\r\nwho styled themselves Ether and Alcohol, with a villainous taint of\r\nmethyl and something very much akin to gunpowder running through their\r\nveins. A most abominable compound they were, and some of the vilest of\r\nthe vile were among their progeny; indeed, they were all a \"hard lot,\"\r\nfor I don't know how many rods--I may say tons--of iron had to be used\r\nbefore they could be brought into the civilized world at all. But,\r\nhappily, they had a short life. Now they have almost passed away from\r\noff the face of the earth, and it is to be hoped that the place that\r\nknew them once will know them no more; for they were a dangerous\r\nset--fragile in substance, frightful abortions, and an incubus on the\r\nfair fame of photography. They bathed in the foulest of baths, and what\r\nserved for one served for all. The poisonous and disgusting fluid was\r\nused over and over again. Loathsome and pestiferous vapours hovered\r\nabout them, and they took up their abode in the back slums of our\r\ncities, and herded with the multitude, and a vast majority of them were\r\nnot worth the consideration of the most callous officer of the sanitary\r\ncommission. Everything that breathes the breath of life has its moments\r\nof agony, and these were the throes that agonised Photography in that\r\nfell epoch of her history.\r\n\r\nFrom the ashes of this burning shame Photography arose, Phoenix-like,\r\nand with Silver, seven times purified, took her ethereal form into the\r\nhearts and _ateliers_ of artists, who welcomed her sunny presence in\r\ntheir abodes of refinement and taste. They treated her kindly and\r\nconsiderately, and lovingly placed her in her proper sphere; and, by\r\ntheir kind and delicate treatment, made her forget the miseries of her\r\ndegradation and the agonies of her travail. Then art aided photography\r\nand photography aided art, and the happy, delightful reciprocity has\r\nbrought down showers of golden rain amidst the sunshine of prosperity to\r\nthousands who follow with love and devotion the chastened and purified\r\nform of Photography, accompanied in all her thoughts and doings by her\r\nelder sister--Art.\r\n\r\nI must apologise for this seeming digression. However, as I have not\r\nentirely abandoned my photographic impressions, I take it for granted\r\nthat I have not presumed too much on the good nature of my readers, and\r\nwill now endeavour to further develop and redevelop the Hudson, and\r\npoint out the many phases of beauty that are fit subjects for the camera\r\nwhich may be seen on the waters and highland boundaries of that\r\nbeautiful river in all seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nAlbany is the capital of the State. It is a large and flourishing city,\r\nand one of the oldest, being an early Dutch settlement, which is\r\nsufficiently attested by the prevalence of such cognomens as\r\n\"Vanderdonck\" and \"Onderdunk\" over the doors of the traders.\r\n\r\nAbout six or eight miles above Albany the Hudson ceases to be navigable\r\nfor steamers and sailing craft, and the influence of the tide becomes\r\nimperceptible. Troy is on the east bank of the river; and about two\r\nmiles above, the Mohawk River joins the Hudson, coming down from the\r\nWestern part of the State of New York. For about two hundred miles the\r\nHudson runs almost due north and south from a little below Fort Edward;\r\nbut, from the Adirondack Mountains, where it takes its spring, it comes\r\ndown in a north-westerly direction by rushing rapids, cascades, and\r\nfalls innumerable for about two hundred miles more through some of the\r\nwildest country that can possibly be imagined.\r\n\r\nWe did not proceed up the Upper Hudson, but I was told it would well\r\nrepay a trip with the camera, as some of the wildest and most\r\npicturesque scenery would be found in tracking the Hudson to its source\r\namong the Adirondack Mountains.\r\n\r\nI afterwards sailed up and down the navigable part of the Hudson many\r\ntimes and at all periods of the year, except when it was ice-bound, by\r\ndaylight and by moonlight, and a more beautiful moonlight sail cannot\r\npossibly be conceived. To be sailing up under the shadow of the\r\nPalisades on a bright moonlight night, and see the eastern shore and\r\nbays bathed in the magnesium-like light of a bright western moon, is in\r\nitself enough to inspire the most ordinary mind with a love of all that\r\nis beautiful and poetical in nature.\r\n\r\nMoonlight excursions are frequently made from New York to various points\r\non the Hudson, and Sleepy Hollow is one of the most favourite trips. I\r\nhave been in that neighbourhood, but never saw the \"headless horseman\"\r\nthat was said to haunt the place; but that may be accounted for by the\r\ncircumstance of some superior officer having recently commanded the\r\ntrooper without a head to do duty in Texas.\r\n\r\nMy next trip up the Hudson was in winter, when the surface of the river\r\nwas in the state of \"glacial,\" solid at 50 deg. for two or three feet\r\ndown, but the temperature was considerably lower, frequently 15 deg. and\r\n20 deg. below zero--and that was nipping cold \"and no mistake,\" making\r\nthe very breath \"glacial,\" plugging up the nostrils with \"chunks\" of ice,\r\nand binding the beard and moustache together, making a glacier on your\r\nface, which you had to break through every now and then to make a\r\nbreathing hole.\r\n\r\nOn this arctic trip the whole aspect of the river and its boundaries is\r\nmarvellously changed, without losing any of its picturesque attractions.\r\nInstead of the clear, deep river having its glassy surface broken by the\r\nsplash of paddle-wheels, it is converted into a solid highway. Instead\r\nof the sound of the \"pilot's gong,\" and the cries of \"a sail on the port\r\nbow,\" there is nothing to be heard but the jingling sound of the sleigh\r\nbells, and the merry laugh and prattle of the fair occupants of the\r\nsleighs, as they skim past on the smooth surface of the ice, wrapped\r\ncosily up in their gay buffalo robes.\r\n\r\nThe great excitement of winter in Canada or the States is to take a\r\nsleigh ride; and I think there is nothing more delightful, when the wind\r\nis still, than to skim along the ice in the bright, winter sunshine,\r\nbehind a pair of spanking \"trotters.\" The horses seem to enjoy it as\r\nmuch as the people, arching their necks a little more proudly than\r\nusual, and stepping lightly to the merry sound of the sleigh bells.\r\n\r\nAt this time of the year large sleighs, holding fifteen to twenty\r\npeople, and drawn by four horses, take the place of steamers, omnibuses,\r\nand ferry boats. The steam ferries are housed, except at New York, and\r\nthere they keep grinding their way through the ice \"all winter,\" as if\r\nthey would not let winter reign over their destinies if they could help\r\nit. Large sleighs cross and recross on the ice higher up the Hudson, and\r\nthus keep up the connection between the various points and opposite\r\nshores. As the mercury falls the spirits of the people seem to rise, and\r\nthey shout and halloo at each other as they pass or race on the ice.\r\nThese are animated scenes for the skill of a Blanchard or any other\r\nartist equally good in the production of instantaneous photographs.\r\n\r\nAnother of the scenes on the Hudson worthy of the camera is \"ploughing\r\nthe ice.\" It is a singular sight to an Englishman to see a man driving a\r\nteam of horses on the ice, and see the white powder rising before the\r\nice-plough like spray from the prow of a vessel as she rushes through\r\nthe water, cutting the ice into blocks or squares, to stow away in\r\n\"chunks,\" and afterwards, when the hot sultry weather of July and August\r\nis prostrating you, have them brought out to make those wonderful\r\nmixtures called \"ice-creams,\" \"sherry-cobblers,\" and \"brandy-cocktails.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hudson is beautiful in winter as well as in summer, and I wonder its\r\nvarious and picturesque beauties have not been photographed more\r\nabundantly. But there it is. Prophets are never honoured in their own\r\ncountry, and artists and photographers never see the beauties of their\r\ncountry at home. I am sure if the Hudson were photographed from the sea\r\nto its source it would be one of the most valuable, interesting, and\r\npicturesque series of photographs that ever was published. Its aspects\r\nin summer are lovely and charming, and the wet process can then be\r\nemployed with success. And in winter, though the temperature is low, the\r\nriver is perfectly dry on the surface, the hills and trees are\r\nglistening with snow and icicles, the people are on the very happiest\r\nterms with one another, and frequently exhibit an abundance of dry, good\r\nhumour. This is the time to work the \"dry process\" most successfully,\r\nand, instead of the \"ammonia developers,\" try the \"hot and strong\" ones.\r\n\r\nWith these few hints to my photographic friends, I leave the beauties of\r\nthe Hudson to their kind consideration.--_British Journal of\r\nPhotography_, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICTURES OF THE POTOMAC IN PEACE AND WAR.\r\n\r\nWhen first I visited that lovely region which has so recently been torn\r\nand trampled down--blackened and defaced by the ruthlessness of\r\nwar--peace lay in the valleys of the Potomac. Nothing was borne on the\r\ncalm, clear bosom of the broad and listless river but the produce of the\r\nrich and smiling valleys of Virginia. Its banks were peaceful, silent,\r\nand beautiful. The peach orchards were white with the blossoms that\r\npromised a rich harvest of their delicious fruit. The neat and pretty\r\nhouses that studded the sloping boundaries of the river were almost\r\nblinding with their dazzling whiteness as the full blaze of the sun fell\r\nupon them. Their inhabitants were happy, and dreamt not of the storm so\r\nsoon to overtake them. The forts were occupied by only a few, very few\r\nsoldiers. The guns were laid aside, all rusty and uncared for; and\r\npilgrims to the tomb of Washington, the good and great, stopped on their\r\nreturn at Fort Washington to examine the fortifications in idleness and\r\npeaceful curiosity. The Capitol at Washington echoed nothing but the\r\nsounds of peace and good will. The senators of both North and South sat\r\nin council together, and considered only the welfare and prosperity of\r\ntheir great confederation.\r\n\r\nThe same harmonious fellowship influenced the appearance and actions of\r\nall; and at that happy conjuncture I made my first acquaintance with\r\nWashington, the capital of the United States. I shall not attempt a\r\ndescription of its geographical position: everybody knows that it is in\r\nthe district of Columbia, and on the banks of the Potomac. It is a city\r\nof vast and pretentious appearance, straggling over an unnecessary\r\namount of ground, and is divided into avenues and streets. The avenues\r\nare named after the principal States, and take their spring from the\r\nCapitol, running off in all directions in angular form, like the spokes\r\nof a wheel, the Capitol being the \"angular point.\" The streets running\r\nbetween and across the avenues rejoice in the euphonious names of First,\r\nSecond, and Third, and A, B, and C streets, the straight lines of which\r\nare broken by trees of the most luxurious growth all along the\r\nside-walks. These trees form a delightful sun-shade in summer, and have\r\na very novel and pleasing effect at night, when their green and leafy\r\narches are illuminated by the gas lamps underneath.\r\n\r\nExcepting the Capitol, White House, Court House, Post Office, Patent\r\nOffice, and Smithsonian Institute, there is nothing in the city of\r\nphotographic interest. The \"United States,\" the \"National,\" and\r\n\"Willards,\" are large and commodious hotels on Pennsylvania Avenue; but\r\nnot worth a plate, photographically speaking, unless the landlords wish\r\nto illustrate their bar bills. The Capitol is out of all proportion the\r\nlargest and most imposing structure in Washington--it may safely be said\r\nin the United States. Situated on an elevated site, at the top of\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, it forms a grand termination to that noble\r\nthoroughfare at its eastern extremity. The building consists of a grand\r\ncentre of freestone painted white, surmounted by a vast dome of\r\nbeautiful proportions. Two large wings of white marble complete the\r\ngrand facade. Ascending the noble flight of marble steps to the\r\nprincipal entrance, the great portico is reached, which is supported by\r\nabout eighteen Corinthian columns. The pediment is ornamented with a\r\nstatue of America in the centre, with the figures of Faith on her left,\r\nand Justice on her right. On each side of the entrance is a group of\r\nstatuary. On one side an Indian savage is about to massacre a mother and\r\nher child, but his arm is arrested by the figure of Civilization. On the\r\nother side the group consists of a man holding up a globe, representing\r\nColumbus and the figure of an Indian girl looking up to it.\r\n\r\nThe large rotunda, immediately underneath the dome, is divided into\r\npanels, which are filled with paintings, such as the \"Landing of the\r\nPilgrim Fathers,\" \"The Baptism of the Indian Princess Pocahontas,\" and\r\nother subjects illustrative of American history. On either side of the\r\nRotunda are passages leading to the House of Representatives on the one\r\nside, and the Senate Chamber on the other. Congress being assembled, I\r\nlooked in to see the collective wisdom of the \"States\" during a morning\r\nsitting. In many respects the House of Representatives very much\r\nresembled our own House of Commons. There was a Mr. Speaker in the\r\nchair, and one gentleman had \"the floor,\" and was addressing the House.\r\nOther members were seated in their desk seats, making notes, or busying\r\nthemselves with their own bills. In one essential point, however, I\r\nfound a difference, and that was in the ease of access to this assembly.\r\nNo \"member's order\" was required. Strangers and \"citizens\" are at all\r\ntimes freely admitted. There is also a magnificent library, which is\r\nfree to everyone.\r\n\r\nDuring the Session there is Divine service in the Senate Chamber on\r\nSunday mornings. On one occasion I attended, and heard a most excellent\r\ndiscourse by the appointed chaplain. The President and his family were\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn some side offices, connected with the Capitol, I found a government\r\nphotographer at work, copying plans, and photographing portions of the\r\nunfinished building, for the benefit of the architects and others whose\r\nduty it was to examine the progress of the works. From this gentleman I\r\nreceived much courteous attention, and was shown many large and\r\nexcellent negatives, all of which were developed with the ordinary iron\r\ndeveloper.\r\n\r\nI next visited the Patent Office, and the museum connected therewith,\r\nwhich contains a vast collection of models of all kinds of inventions\r\nthat have received protection--among them several things, in apparatus\r\nand implements, connected with photography. The American patent laws\r\nrequire a model of every new invention to be lodged in this museum,\r\nwhich is of immense value to inventors and intending patentees; for\r\nthey can there see what has already been protected; and as the Patent\r\nOffice refuses to grant protection to anything of a similar form, use,\r\nor application, much litigation, expense, and annoyance are saved the\r\npatentees. Our Government would do well to take a leaf out of \"Brother\r\nJonathan's\" book on this subject; for not only is there increased\r\nprotection given to inventors, but the fees are considerably less than\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\nThe presidential residence, called the White House, was the next\r\ninteresting subject of observation. It is situated at the west end of\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, and a good mile from the Capitol. The building is\r\nof white marble, and of very unpretending size and architectural\r\nattractions, but in every respect sufficient for the simple wants of the\r\nchief magistrate of the United States, whose official salary is only\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars per annum.\r\n\r\nDuring congressional session the President holds weekly _levees_; and\r\none of these I determined to attend, prompted as much by curiosity to\r\nsee how such things were done, as desire to pay my respects.\r\nAccordingly, on a certain night, at eight o'clock precisely, I went to\r\nthe White House, and was admitted without hesitation. On reaching the\r\ndoor of the reception room, I gave my card to the district marshal, who\r\nconducted me to President Pierce, to whom I was introduced. I was\r\nreceived with a hearty welcome, and a shake of the hand. Indeed, I\r\nnoticed that he had a kindly word of greeting for all who came. Not\r\nhaving any very important communication to make that would be either\r\nstartling or interesting to the President of the United States, I bowed,\r\nand retired to the promenade room, where I found numbers of people who\r\nhad been \"presented\" walking about and chatting in groups on all sorts\r\nof subjects--political, foreign, and domestic, and anything they liked.\r\nSome were in evening dress, others not; but all seemed perfectly easy\r\nand affable one with another. There was no restraint, and the only\r\npassport required to these _levees_ was decent behaviour and\r\nrespectability. There was music also. A band was playing in the\r\nvestibule, and everyone evidently enjoyed the _reunion_, and felt\r\nperfectly at home. Never having been presented at court, I am not able\r\nto make any comparison _pro_ or _con_.\r\n\r\nThere is also an observatory at Washington, which I visited;\r\nbut not being fortunate enough to meet the--what shall I say?\r\n\"astronomer-royal,\" comes readiest, but that is not correct: well,\r\nthen, the--\"astronomer republic,\" I did not see the large telescope\r\nand other astronomical instruments worked.\r\n\r\nThe photographic galleries were all situated on Pennsylvania Avenue, and\r\nthey were numerous enough. At that time they rejoiced in the name of\r\n\"Daguerrean Galleries;\" and the proprietor, or operator, was called a\r\n\"Daguerrean.\" Their reception rooms were designated \"saloons,\" which\r\nwere invariably well furnished--some of them superbly--and filled with\r\nspecimens. Their \"studios\" and workshops behind the scenes were fitted\r\nwith all sorts of ingenious contrivances for \"buffing\" and \"coating\" and\r\nexpediting the work. Although the greatest number of mechanical\r\nappliances were employed in the Daguerreotype branch of photography, art\r\nwas not altogether ignored in its practice. One house made a business\r\nfeature of very beautifully coloured Daguerreotypes, tinted with dry\r\ncolours, quite equal to those done in Europe. Another house made a\r\nfeature of \"Daguerreotypes painted in oil;\" and the likeness was most\r\nadmirably preserved. I saw one of the President, and several of the\r\nmembers of Congress, which I knew to be unmistakable portraits. Although\r\nthe Daguerreotype was most tenaciously adhered to as the best means of\r\nproducing photographic portraits, the collodion process--or the\r\n\"crystaltype,\" as they then called it--was not neglected. It was used by\r\na few for portraits, but chiefly for views.\r\n\r\nHaving seen all that was worth seeing in the city, I made excursions\r\ninto the country, in search of subjects for the camera or pencil.\r\n\r\nGeorgetown, a little way from Washington, and its picturesque cemetery,\r\noffer several pretty bits for the camera. Arlington Heights, the Long\r\nBridge, and many nooks about there, are sufficiently tempting; but of\r\nall the excursions about Washington, Mount Vernon--a few miles down the\r\nPotomac, on the Virginia side--is by far the most interesting. Mount\r\nVernon is the name of the place where General George Washington lived\r\nand died, and is the \"Mecca\" of the Americans. Nearly every day there\r\nare pilgrims from some or all parts of the States to the tomb of\r\nWashington, which is in the grounds of Mount Vernon. They visit this\r\nplace with a kind of religious awe and veneration, and come from far and\r\nwide to say they have seen it. For, in truth, there is little to see but\r\nthe strangest-looking and ugliest brick building I ever beheld, with\r\nopen iron gates that allow you to look into the darkness of the\r\ninterior, and see nothing. I took a view of the tomb, and here it is:--A\r\nred brick building, squat and low, of the most unsightly design and\r\nproportions imaginable--resembling one of our country \"deadhouses\" more\r\nthan anything else I could compare it to. It was stuck away from the\r\nhouse among trees and brushwood, and in an advanced state of\r\ndilapidation--a disgrace to the nation that had sprung from that great\r\nman's honest devotion! Over the Gothic entrance is a white slab, with\r\nthe following inscription on it:--\r\n\r\n   \"Within this Enclosure\r\n           Rest\r\n      the remains of\r\n  General George Washington.\"\r\n\r\nThe remains of \"Lady Washington\" lie there also; and there are several\r\nwhite obelisks about to the memory of other members of the family.\r\n\r\nThe house itself is a \"frame building\" of two storeys, with a piazza\r\nrunning along the front of it, and is on the whole a mean-looking\r\nedifice; but was probably grand enough for the simple tastes of the man\r\nwho dwelt in it, and has hallowed the place with the greatness and\r\ngoodness of his life. The interior of the house looked as if it had once\r\nbeen a comfortable and cozy habitation. In the hall was put up a desk,\r\nwith a \"visitors' book,\" wherein they were expected to enter their\r\nnames; and few failed to pay such a cheap tribute to the memory of the\r\nfather of their country.\r\n\r\nThe grounds, which were full of natural beauties, had been allowed to\r\nrun into a state of wild tangle-wood; and I had some trouble to pick my\r\nway over broken paths down to the riverside again, where I took the\r\n\"boat,\" and returned to the city, touching at Fort Washington on the\r\nway. The day had been remarkably fine; the evening was calm and lovely;\r\nthe silence of the river disturbed only by the splash of our paddles,\r\nand the song of the fishermen on shore as they drew in their laden nets;\r\nand the moon shone as only she can shine in those latitudes. Nothing\r\ncould denote more peace and quietude as I sailed on the Potomac on that\r\nlovely evening. There was such a perfect lull of the natural\r\nelements--such a happy combination of all that was beautiful and\r\npromising--it seemed impossible for such a hurricane of men's\r\npassions--such yells of strife and shouts of victory, such a swoop of\r\ndeath as afterwards rushed down those valleys--ever to come to pass.\r\n\r\nSuch sad reverse was, however, seen on my second visit to the Potomac.\r\nThe narration of the stirring scenes then presented will form a picture\r\nless peaceful and happy, but unfortunately intensely real and painfully\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nMy second visit to the Potomac was paid after the lapse of several\r\nyears, and under very different circumstances. When the Capitol echoed\r\nloudly the fierce and deadly sentiments of the men of the North against\r\nthe men of the South. When both had shouted--\r\n\r\n  \"Strike up the drums, and let the tongue of war\r\n   Plead for our int'rest.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the deliberations of the senators were \"war estimates,\" arming of\r\ntroops, and hurrying them to the \"front\" with all possible despatch.\r\nWhen the city of Washington presented all the appearance of a place\r\nthreatened with a siege. When every unoccupied building was turned into\r\nbarracks, and every piece of unoccupied land was made a \"camp ground.\"\r\nWhen the inhabitants were in terror and dismay, dreading the approach of\r\nan invading host. When hasty earth-works were thrown up in front of the\r\ncity, and the heights were bristling with cannon. When the woods and\r\npeach orchards on the opposite side of the Potomac were red with the\r\nglare of the camp fires at night, and the flashing of bayonets was\r\nalmost blinding in the hot sun at noon. When the vessels sailing on the\r\nriver were laden with armed men, shot, shell, and \"villainous\r\nsaltpetre.\" When the incessant roll of drums and rattle of musketry\r\ndeadened almost every other sound. When sentinels guarded every road and\r\naccess to the capital, and passports were required from the military\r\nauthorities to enable you to move from one place to another. In short,\r\nwhen the whole atmosphere was filled with sounds of martial strife, and\r\neverything took the form of desolating war.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these untoward events, I found photography actively\r\nengaged in the city, in the camp, and on the field, fulfilling a mission\r\nof mercy and consolation in the midst of carnage and tumult--fulfilling\r\nsuch a mission of holy work as never before fell to the lot of any art\r\nor art-science to perform. For what aspect of life is photography not\r\ncalled upon to witness?--what phase of this world's weal or woe is\r\nphotography not required to depict? Photography has become a handmaiden\r\nto the present generation--a ministering angel to all conditions of\r\nlife, from the cradle to the grave. An _aide-de-camp_ of the loveliest\r\ncharacter to the great \"light of the world,\" humanizing and elevating\r\nthe minds of all, administering consolation to the sorrowing, increasing\r\nthe joy of the joyous, lessening the pangs of separation caused by\r\ndistance or death, strengthening the ties of immediate fellowship,\r\nhelping the world to know its benefactors, and the world's benefactors\r\nto know the world. When grim death stalks into the gilded palaces of the\r\ngreat and powerful, or into the thatched cottages and miserable\r\ndwellings of the poor, photography is the assuager of the griefs of the\r\nsorrowing survivors, and the ameliorator of their miseries, by\r\npreserving to them so faithful a resemblance of the lost one. When the\r\nbride, in her youth and loveliness, is attired for the bridal,\r\nphotography is the recorder of her trustful looks and April smiles, the\r\nfashion of her dress, the wreath and jewels that she wore; and, come\r\nwhat change in her appearance that may, the husband can look upon his\r\nbride whene'er he likes in after years, as vividly and as distinctly as\r\non that day, connecting the present with the past with a kind of running\r\nchord of happy recollections. Photography is now the historian of earth\r\nand animated nature, the biographer of man, the registrar of his growth\r\nfrom childhood to \"man's estate,\" the delineator of his physical, moral,\r\nand social progress, the book of fashion, and the mirror of the times.\r\nThe uses and applications of photography are almost indescribable;\r\nscarcely an art, or a science, or a trade or profession that does not\r\nenlist photography into its service. Photography does not merely pander\r\nto the gratification of earthly vanity, but is an alleviator of human\r\nmisery. Photography enters our hospitals and registers faithfully the\r\nprogress of disease, its growth and change from day to day, until it is\r\ncured, or ripe for the knife of the surgeon; its pictures are lessons to\r\nthe professor, and a book of study for the students, charts for their\r\nguidance through the painful and tedious cases of others similarly\r\nafflicted, teaching them what to do and what to avoid, to relieve the\r\nsuffering of other patients. Photography is dragged into our criminal\r\nlaw courts, and sits on the right hand of Justice, giving evidence of\r\nthe most undeniable character, without being under oath, and free from\r\nthe suspicion of perjury, convicting murderers and felons, and\r\nacquitting the innocent without prejudice; and in our courts of equity,\r\ncases are frequently decided by the truth-telling evidence of\r\nphotography.\r\n\r\nAstronomers, geographers, and electricians freely acknowledge how much\r\nthey are indebted to photography in making their celestial and\r\nterrestrial observations. Engineers, civil and military, employ\r\nphotography largely in their plans and studies. Art, also, has recourse\r\nto photography, and is the only one of the liberal professions that is\r\nhalf ashamed to admit the aid it gains from the camera. If art admits it\r\nat all, it is done grudgingly, apologetically, and thanklessly. But\r\nthere it is the old, old story of family quarrels and family jealousies.\r\nOld art might be likened to an old aunt that has grown withered and\r\nwrinkled, and peevish with disappointment, who, in spite of all her\r\nlong-studied rules and principles of light and shade, harmony of colour,\r\npainting, \"glazing,\" and \"scumbling,\" has failed to win the first\r\nprize--that prize which a woman's ambition pants after from the moment\r\nshe enters her teens until her dream is realized--that living model,\r\nmoulded after God's own image, which, not having won in her mature age,\r\nshe becomes jealous of the growing graces, the fresh and rollicking\r\ncharms, the unstudied and ingenuous truthfulness of form exhibited by\r\nher niece. Old Art the aunt, Photography the niece. Readers, draw the\r\nmoral for yourselves.\r\n\r\nI have digressed, but could not help it. Photography is so young and\r\nlovely, so bewitchingly beautiful in all her moods, so fascinating and\r\nenslaving--and she has enslaved thousands since she first sprung from\r\nthe source that gives her life. But to return to my theme.\r\n\r\nThe practice of photography, like the aspects of the country and\r\ncondition of the people, was changed. \"Old things had passed away, and\r\nall things had become new.\" The shining silver plates, buffing wheels,\r\ncoating boxes, mercury pans, &c., of the old dispensation had given\r\nplace to the baths, nitrate of silver solutions, and iron developers of\r\nthe new. Ambrotypes, or glass positives, and photographs on paper, had\r\ntaken the place of the now antiquated Daguerreotype. Mammoth photographs\r\nwere the ambition of all photographers. The first full-length life-sized\r\nphotograph I ever saw was in Washington, and was the work of Mr.\r\nGardner, the manager of Mr. Brady's gallery. But a more republican idea\r\nof photography, which, strange to say, originated in an empire not\r\nremarkable for freedom of thought, soon became the dominant power.\r\nCartes-de-visite, the many, ruled over mammoth, the few. The price of\r\nmammoth photographs was beyond the reach of millions, but the prices of\r\ncartes-de-visite were within the grasp of all; and that, combined with\r\ntheir convenient size and prettiness of form, made them at once popular,\r\nand created a mania.\r\n\r\nThe carte-de-visite form of picture became the \"rage\" in America about\r\nthe time the civil war commenced, and as the young soldiers were proud\r\nof their new uniforms, and those who had been \"in action\" were prouder\r\nstill of their stains and scars, the photographers did a good business\r\namong them, both in the city and in the camp. I saw a little of this\r\n\"camp work\" and \"camp life\" myself, and some of the havoc of war as\r\nwell. Photographers are adventurous, and frequently getting into odd\r\nkinds of \"positions,\" as well as their \"sitters.\"\r\n\r\nIt was my destiny, under the guidance of the Great Source of Light, to\r\nwitness the results of the first great conflict between the opposing\r\narmies of the Federals and Confederates; to hear the thunder of their\r\nartillery, and see the clouds of smoke hovering over the battle field,\r\nwithout being in the battle itself. To see the rout and panic of the\r\nNorthern troops, who had so recently marched proudly on to fancied\r\nvictory; to witness the disgraceful and disastrous stampede of the\r\nNorthern army from the field of Bull Run; to listen to the agonized\r\ngroans of the \"severely wounded\" as they were hurried past to the\r\ntemporary hospitals in Washington and Georgetown; to be an eye-witness\r\nto the demoralized condition of men who, naturally brave, were under the\r\ninfluence of a panic caused by the vague apprehension of a danger that\r\ndid not exist; to hear the citizens exclaim, \"What shall we do?\" and\r\n\"For God's sake don't tell your people at home what you have seen!\" and\r\ncomparing the reverse of their national arms to a \"regular Waterloo\r\ndefeat,\" which was anything but a happy simile. To see the\r\npanic-stricken men themselves, when they discovered their error, and\r\nbegan to realize their shame, weeping like women at the folly they had\r\ncommitted. But they atoned for all this, afterwards, by deeds of\r\nglorious valour which were never surpassed, and which ended in restoring\r\ntheir country to peace and reunion.\r\n\r\nThe 21st of July, 1861, was a Sunday, and as calm and beautiful a day as\r\ncould be wished for. From its associations it ought to have been a day\r\nof rest and peace to all; but it was not. There was terrible slaughter\r\namong men that Sunday in Virginia. During the morning, I took advantage\r\nof an opportunity offered me to go down to Alexandria, in Virginia,\r\nabout five or six miles below Washington, which was then occupied by a\r\nportion of the Federal Army. Everything in the place had the appearance\r\nof war. There were more soldiers than civilians about. Hotels were\r\nturned into barracks and military storehouses. The hotel where Colonel\r\nEllsworth, of the New York Fire Zouaves, was shot by the proprietor for\r\nhauling down the Confederate flag--which the latter had hoisted over his\r\nhouse--had been taken possession of by the military authorities, and\r\nthe whole place was under martial law. It was there I first heard\r\nrumours of a battle being fought in the neighbourhood of Manassas\r\nJunction. These rumours were soon confirmed by the roar of cannon in the\r\ndistance, and the hurrying of fresh troops from Washington to the field\r\nof battle. But they were not needed. Before they could reach the field\r\nthe \"stampede\" had commenced, and the retreating hosts came like a\r\nrushing tide upon the advancing few, and carried them back, absorbed in\r\nthe unshapen mass of confusion.\r\n\r\nThe night came, and little was known by the inhabitants of Washington of\r\nthe rout and rush of terrified men towards the city; but the next\r\nmorning revealed the fact.\r\n\r\nWet and wretched was the morning after the battle. The heavens seemed to\r\nweep over the disgrace as the men poured into the city, singly and in\r\ngroups, unofficered, and without their firearms, which many had lost, or\r\nthrown away in their flight. The citizens gathered round them, anxious\r\nto learn all about the defeat, and the whereabouts of the Confederate\r\narmy, and invited them into their houses to take refreshment and rest.\r\nSeveral instances of this impromptu hospitality and sympathy I witnessed\r\nmyself; and many of the weary and wounded soldiers I talked to. They\r\nthat were only slightly wounded in the hands and arms had their wounds\r\nwashed and dressed by the wives and daughters of many of the residents.\r\nThe hotels were crowded, and the \"bars\" were besieged by the drenched\r\nand fatigued soldiers, whom the curious and sympathizing citizens\r\ninvited to \"liquor.\" The men all told wonderful stories of the fight and\r\nof their own escape, but none could tell satisfactorily what had created\r\nthe panic. Some said that a few \"teamsters\" took the alarm, and, riding\r\nto the rear in hot haste, conveyed the impression that an exterminating\r\npursuit by the Confederates had commenced.\r\n\r\nIn a day or two the majority of the men were mustered together again,\r\nand occupied their old camping grounds, where I visited them, and heard\r\nmany of their stories, and got some of the relics of the battle field.\r\nFresh troops were raised, and placed under the command of another\r\ngeneral. But it was long before another \"onward march to Richmond\" was\r\nattempted. The North had learned something of the strength and prowess\r\nof the South, and began to prepare for a longer and fiercer struggle\r\nwith \"Secession.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the two pictures of the Potomac which I have endeavoured to\r\nreproduce, and which fell under my observation during my professional\r\nperegrinations in connection with the practice of photography.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAMBLES AMONG THE STUDIOS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nMy impressions of America, from a photographic point of observation,\r\nwere taken at two distinct periods--which I might call the two epochs of\r\nphotographic history--the dry and the wet; the first being the\r\nDaguerreotype, and the second what may be termed the present era of\r\nphotography, which includes the processes now known and practised.\r\n\r\nI take Boston as my starting point for several reasons. First, because\r\nit was the first American city I visited; secondly, it was in Boston\r\nthat the change first came over photography which wrought such a\r\nrevolution in the art all over the United States; thirdly and severally,\r\nin Boston I noticed many things in connection with photography which\r\ndiffered widely from what I had known and practised in England.\r\n\r\nVisiting the gallery of Mr. Whipple, then in Washington Street, the\r\nbusiest thoroughfare in Boston, I was struck with the very large\r\ncollection of Daguerreotype portraits there exhibited, but particularly\r\nwith a large display of Daguerreotypes of the moon in various aspects.\r\nI had heard of Mr. Whipple's success in Daguerreotyping the moon before\r\nI left Europe, but had no idea that so much had been achieved in lunar\r\nphotography at that early date until I saw Mr. Whipple's case of\r\nphotographs of the moon in many phases. Those Daguerreotypes were\r\nremarkable for their sharpness and delicacy, and the many trying\r\nconditions under which they were taken. They were all obtained at\r\nCambridge College under the superintendance of Professor Bond, but in\r\nwhat manner I had better allow Mr. Whipple to speak for himself, by\r\nmaking an extract from a letter of his, published in _The Photographic\r\nArt Journal_ of America, July, 1853. Mr. Whipple says: \"My first attempt\r\nat Daguerreotyping the moon was with a reflecting telescope; the mirror\r\nwas five feet focus, and seven inches diameter. By putting the prepared\r\nplate directly in the focus of the reflector, and giving it an exposure\r\nof from three to five seconds, I obtained quite distinct impressions;\r\nbut owing to the smallness of the image, which was only about\r\nfive-eighths of an inch in diameter, and the want of clockwork to\r\nregulate the motion of the telescope, the results were very far from\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\"Having obtained permission of Professor Bond to use the large Cambridge\r\nreflector for that purpose, I renewed my experiments with high hopes of\r\nsuccess, but soon found it no easy matter to obtain a clear,\r\nwell-defined, beautiful Daguerreotype of the moon. Nothing could be more\r\ninteresting than its appearance through that _magnificent_ instrument:\r\nbut to transfer it to the silver plate, to make something tangible of\r\nit, was quite a different thing. The \"governor,\" that regulates the\r\nmotion of the telescope, although sufficiently accurate for observing\r\npurposes, was entirely unsuitable for Daguerreotyping; as when the plate\r\nis exposed to the moon's image, if the instrument does not follow\r\nexactly to counteract the earth's motion, even to the nicety of a\r\nhair's breadth, the beauty of the impression is much injured, or\r\nentirely spoiled. The governor had a tendency to move the instrument a\r\nlittle too fast, then to fall slightly behind. By closely noticing its\r\nmotion, and by exposing my plates those few seconds that it exactly\r\nfollowed between the accelerated and retarded motion, I might obtain one\r\nor two perfect proofs in the trial of a dozen plates, other things being\r\nright. But a more serious obstacle to my success was the usual state of\r\nthe atmosphere in the locality--the sea breeze, the hot and cold air\r\ncommingling, although its effects were not visible to the eye; but when\r\nthe moon was viewed through the telescope it had the same appearance as\r\nobjects when seen through the heated air from a chimney, in a constant\r\ntremor, precluding the possibility of successful Daguerreotyping. This\r\nstate of the atmosphere often continued week after week in a greater or\r\nless degree, so that an evening of perfect quiet was hailed with the\r\ngreatest delight. After oft-repeated failures, I finally obtained the\r\nDaguerreotype from which the crystallotypes I send for your journal were\r\ncopies; it was taken in March, 1851. The object glass only of the\r\ntelescope was used. It is fifteen inches in diameter, and about\r\ntwenty-three feet focal length; the image it gives of the moon varies\r\nbut little from three inches, and the prepared plate had an exposure of\r\nthirteen seconds.\"\r\n\r\nCopies of several of these \"crystallotypes\" of the moon I afterwards\r\nobtained and exhibited at the Photographic Exhibition in connection\r\nwith the British Association which met in Glasgow in 1855. The\r\n\"crystallotypes\" were simply enlarged photographs, about eight or nine\r\ninches in diameter, and conveyed to the mind an excellent idea of the\r\nmoon's surface. The orange-like form and the principal craters were\r\ndistinctly marked. Indeed, so much were they admired as portraits of the\r\nmoon, that one of the _savans_ bought the set at the close of the\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\nMr. Whipple is still a successful practitioner of our delightful art in\r\nthe \"Athens of the Western World,\" and has reaped the reward of his\r\ncontinuity and devotion to his favourite art. The late decision of the\r\nAmerican law courts on the validity of Mr. Cutting's patent for the use\r\nof bromides in collodion must have laid Mr. Whipple under serious\r\nliabilities, for he used bromo-iodized negative collodion for iron\r\ndevelopment as far back as 1853.\r\n\r\nThere were many other professional photographers in the chief city of\r\nMassachusetts; but I have described the characteristics of the principal\r\nand oldest concerns. Doubtless there are many new ones since I visited\r\nthe city where Benjamin Franklin served his apprenticeship as a printer;\r\nwhere the \"colonists\" in 1773, rather than pay the obnoxious \"tea tax,\"\r\npitched all the tea out of the ships into the waters of Boston Bay, and\r\ncommenced that long struggle against oppression and unjust taxation\r\nwhich eventually ended in severing the North American Colonies from the\r\nmother country. With the knowledge of all this, it is the more\r\nsurprising that they should now so quietly submit to what must be an\r\nobnoxious and troublesome system of taxation; for, not only have\r\nphotographers to pay an annual licence of about two guineas for carrying\r\non their trade, but also to affix a government stamp on each picture\r\nsent out, which is a further tax of about one penny on each. Surely the\r\npatience of our brother photographers on the other side of the Atlantic\r\nmust be sorely tried, what with the troubles of their business, the\r\nwhims and eccentricities of their sitters, Mr. Cutting's unkind cut, and\r\nthe prowling visitations of the tax-collector.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful place New York is for photographic galleries! Their\r\nnumber is legion, and their size is mammoth. Everything is \"mammoth.\"\r\nTheir \"saloons\" are mammoth. Their \"skylights\" are mammoth. Their\r\n\"tubes,\" or lenses, are mammoth. Their \"boxes,\" or cameras, are mammoth;\r\nand _mammoth_ is the amount of business that is done in some of those\r\n\"galleries.\" The \"stores\" of the dealers in photographic \"stock\" are\r\nmammoth; and the most mammoth of all is the \"store\" of Messrs. E. & H.\r\nT. Anthony, on Broadway. This establishment is one of the many palaces\r\nof commerce on that splendid thoroughfare. The building is of iron, tall\r\nand graceful, of the Corinthian order, with Corinthian pilasters,\r\npillars, and capitals. It is five storeys high, with a frontage of about\r\nthirty feet, and a depth of two hundred feet, running right through the\r\n\"block\" from Broadway to the next street on the west side of it. This is\r\nthe largest store of the kind in New York; I think I may safely say, in\r\neither of the two continents, east or west, containing a stock of all\r\nsorts of photographic goods, from \"sixpenny slides\" to \"mammoth tubes,\"\r\nvarying in aggregate value from one hundred and fifty thousand to two\r\nhundred thousand dollars. The heads of the firm are most enterprising,\r\none taking the direction of the commercial department, and the other the\r\nscientific and experimental. Nearly all novelties in apparatus and\r\nphotographic requisites pass through this house into the hands of our\r\nAmerican _confreres_ of the camera, and not unfrequently find their way\r\nto the realms of Queen Victoria on both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nWhen the carte-de-visite pictures were introduced, the oldest and\r\nlargest houses held aloof from them, and only reluctantly, and under\r\npressure, took hold of them at last. Why, it is difficult to say, unless\r\ntheir very small size was too violent a contrast to the mammoth pictures\r\nthey were accustomed to handle. Messrs. Rockwood and Co., of Broadway,\r\nwere the first to make a great feature of the carte-de-visite in New\r\nYork. They also introduced the \"Funnygraph,\" but the latter had a very\r\nshort life.\r\n\r\nIn the Daguerreotype days there was a \"portrait factory\" on Broadway,\r\nwhere likenesses were turned out as fast as coining, for the small\r\ncharge of twenty-five cents a head. The arrangements for such rapid work\r\nwere very complete. I had a dollar's worth of these \"factory\"\r\nportraits. At the desk I paid my money, and received four tickets, which\r\nentitled me to as many sittings when my turn came. I was shown into a\r\nwaiting room crowded with people. The customers were seated on forms\r\nplaced round the room, sidling their way to the entrance of the\r\noperating room, and answering the cry of \"the next\" in much the same\r\nmanner that people do at our public baths. I being \"the next,\" at last\r\nwent into the operating room, where I found the operator stationed at\r\nthe camera, which he never left all day long, except occasionally to\r\nadjust a stupid sitter. He told the next to \"Sit down\" and \"Look thar,\"\r\nfocussed, and, putting his hand into a hole in the wall which\r\ncommunicated with the \"coating room,\" he found a dark slide ready filled\r\nwith a sensitised plate, and putting it into the camera, \"exposed,\" and\r\nsaying \"That will dew,\" took the dark slide out of the camera, and\r\nshoved it through another hole in the wall communicating with the\r\nmercury or developing room. This was repeated as many times as I wanted\r\nsittings, which he knew by the number of tickets I had given to a boy in\r\nthe room, whose duty it was to look out for \"the next,\" and collect the\r\ntickets. The operator had nothing to do with the preparation of the\r\nplates, developing, fixing, or finishing of the picture. He was\r\nresponsible only for the \"pose\" and \"time,\" the \"developer,\" checking\r\nand correcting the latter occasionally by crying out \"Short\" or \"Long\"\r\nas the case might be. Having had my number of \"sittings,\" I was\r\nrequested to leave the operating room by another door which opened\r\ninto a passage that led me to the \"delivery desk,\" where, in a few\r\nminutes, I got all my four portraits fitted up in \"matt, glass, and\r\npreserver,\"--the pictures having been passed from the developing room to\r\nthe \"gilding\" room, thence to the \"fitting room\" and the \"delivery\r\ndesk,\" where I received them. Thus they were all finished and carried\r\naway without the camera operator ever having seen them. Three of the\r\nfour portraits were as fine Daguerreotypes as could be produced\r\nanywhere. Ambrotypes, or \"Daguerreotypes on glass\" as some called them,\r\nwere afterwards produced in much the same manufacturing manner.\r\n\r\nThere were many other galleries on Broadway: Canal Street; the Bowery;\r\nthe Avenues, 1, 2, and 3; A, B, and C, Water Street; Hudson Street, by\r\nthe shipping, &c., the proprietors of which conducted their business in\r\nthe style most suited to their \"location\" and the class of customers\r\nthey had to deal with; but in no case was there any attempt at that \"old\r\nclothesman\"--that \"Petticoat Lane\"--style of touting and dragging\r\ncustomers in by the collar. All sorts of legitimate modes of advertising\r\nwere resorted to--flags flying out of windows and from the roofs of\r\nhouses; handsome show cases at the doors; glowing advertisements in the\r\nnewspapers, in prose and verse; circulars freely distributed among the\r\nhotels, &c.; but none of that \"have your picture taken,\" annoying, and\r\ndisreputable style adopted by the cheap and common establishments in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, \"Sunday trading\" is practised more extensively in New York\r\nthan in London. Nearly all but the most respectable galleries are open\r\non Sundays, and evidently do a thriving trade. The authorities\r\nendeavoured to stop it frequently, by summoning parties and inflicting\r\nfines, but it was no use. The fines were paid, and Sunday photography\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nThe \"glass houses\" of America differ entirely from what we understand by\r\nthe name here; indeed, I never saw such a thing there, either by chance,\r\naccident, or design--for chance has no \"glass houses\" in America, only\r\nan agency; there are no accidental glass houses, and the operating rooms\r\nbuilt by design are not \"glass houses\" at all.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the houses in New York and other American cities are\r\nbuilt with nearly flat roofs, and many of them with lessening storeys\r\nfrom front to back, resembling a flight of two or three steps. In one of\r\nthese roofs, according to circumstances, a large \"skylight\" is fixed,\r\nand pitched usually at an angle of 45 deg., and the rooms, as a rule, are\r\nlarge enough to allow the sitter to be placed anywhere within the radius\r\nof the light, so that any effect or any view of the face can easily be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe light is not any more actinic there than here in good weather, but\r\nthey have a very great deal more light of a good quality _all the year\r\nround_ than we have.\r\n\r\nThe operators work generally with a highly bromized collodion, which, as\r\na rule, they make themselves, but not throughout. They buy the\r\ngun-cotton of some good maker--Mr. Tomlinson, agent for Mr. Cutting,\r\ngenerally supplied the best--then dissolve, iodize, and bromize to suit\r\ntheir working.\r\n\r\nPyrogallic acid as an intensifier is very little used by the American\r\noperators, so little that it is not kept in stock by the dealers.\r\nRequiring some once, I had quite a hunt for it, but found some at last,\r\nstowed away as \"Not Wanted,\" in Messrs. Anthony's store. The general\r\nintensifier is what they laconically call \"sulph.,\" which is sulphuret\r\nof potassium in a very dilute solution, either flowed over the plate, or\r\nthe plate is immersed in a dipping bath, after fixing, which is by far\r\nthe _pleasantest_ way to employ the \"sulph. solution.\" Throwing it about\r\nas some of them do is anything but agreeable. In such cases, \"sulph.\"\r\nwas the first thing that saluted my olfactories on putting my head\r\ninside one of their \"dark rooms.\"\r\n\r\nUp to 1860 the American photographic prints were all on plain paper, and\r\nobtained by the ammonia nitrate of silver bath, and toned and fixed with\r\nthe hyposulphite of soda and gold. The introduction of the\r\ncartes-de-visite forced the operators to make use of albumenized paper;\r\nbut even then they seemed determined to adhere to the ammonia process if\r\npossible, for they commenced all sorts of experiments with that volatile\r\naccelerator, both wet and dry, some by adding ammonia and ether to an\r\n80-grain silver bath, others by fuming, and toning with an acetate and\r\ngold bath, and fixing with hypo afterwards.\r\n\r\nWith the following \"musings\" on \"wrappers\" (not \"spirit wrappers,\" nor\r\nrailway wrappers, but \"carte-de-visite wrappers\"), I shall conclude my\r\nrambles among the galleries of New York. Wrappers generally afford an\r\nexcellent opportunity for ornamental display. Many of the wrappers of\r\nour magazines are elegantly and artistically ornamented. Nearly every\r\npack of playing cards is done up in a beautiful wrapper. The French have\r\ngiven their attention to the subject of \"carte-de-visite wrappers,\" and\r\nturned out a few unique patterns, which, however, never came much into\r\nuse in this country. The Americans, more alive to fanciful and tasteful\r\nobjects of ornamentation, and close imitators of the French in these\r\nmatters, have made more use of carte-de-visite wrappers than we have.\r\nMany wrappers of an artistic and literary character are used by the\r\nphotographers in America--some with ornamental designs; some with the\r\naddress of the houses tastefully executed; others with poetical\r\neffusions, in which the cartes-de-visite are neatly wrapped up, and\r\nhanded over to the sitter.\r\n\r\nSurely a useful suggestion is here given, for wrappers are useful things\r\nin their way, and, if made up tastefully, would attract attention to the\r\nphotographic establishments that issue them. Photography is so closely\r\nallied to art that it is desirable to have everything in connection with\r\nit of an elegant and artistic description. The plain paper\r\nenvelopes--gummed up at the ends, and difficult to get open again--are\r\nvery inartistic, and anything but suitable to envelop such pretty little\r\npictures as cartes-de-visite. Let photography encourage art and art\r\nmanufactures, and art will enter into a treaty of reciprocity for their\r\nmutual advancement.--_Photographic News_, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DUBLIN AND BACK, WITH A GLANCE AT THE EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\nThe bell rings; a shrill shriek; puff, puff goes the engine, and we dart\r\naway from the station at Euston Square, provided with a return ticket to\r\nDublin, issued by the London and North Western Railway, available for\r\none month, for the very reasonable charge of L3, first-class and cabin;\r\nL2 7s. 6d. second class and cabin; or forty shillings third class and\r\nsteerage, via Holyhead. These charges include steamboat fare and\r\nsteward's fee. The Exhibition Committee have made arrangements with the\r\nrailway companies to run excursion trains once a fortnight at still\r\nlower rates; twenty-one shillings from London to Dublin and back, and\r\nfrom other places in proportion. This ticket will be good for a\r\nfortnight, and will entitle the holder to another ticket, giving him two\r\nadmissions to the Exhibition for one shilling. With the ordinary monthly\r\nticket, which is issued daily, it is quite optional whether you go by\r\nthe morning or evening train; but by all means take the morning train,\r\nso that you may pass through North Wales and the Island of Anglesea in\r\ndaylight. Passing through England by Rugby, Stafford, Crewe, and\r\nChester, nothing remarkable occurs during our rapid run through that\r\npart of the country. But an \"Irish Gentleman,\" a fellow traveller,\r\nlearning our destination, kindly volunteered to enlighten us how we\r\ncould best see Dublin and its lions in the shortest possible time, and\r\nadvised us by all \"manes\" not to \"lave\" Dublin without seeing \"Faynix\r\nPark,\" and taking a car drive to Howth and other places round the \"Bee\r\nof Dublin.\" Accordingly we agreed to take his advice; but as our primary\r\nobject in visiting Dublin is to see the Exhibition, we will first attend\r\nto that on our arrival in the Irish capital; and if, after that, time\r\nwill permit, the extraneous lions will receive our attention. First of\r\nall, we must describe how we got there, what we saw on the way, and what\r\nwere our impressions on entering Dublin Bay.\r\n\r\nAs we said before, nothing particular occurred during our journey\r\nthrough England to excite our attention or curiosity; but on passing\r\ninto Wales--Flintshire--our attention is at once arrested by the\r\ndifference of the scenery through which we pass. Soon after leaving\r\nChester, we get a sight of the river Dee on our right, and continue to\r\nrun down by its side past Flint, Bagillt, Holywell, and Mostyn, then we\r\ntake a bend to the left and skirt a part of the Irish Channel past Rhyl,\r\nAbergele, and Colwyn to Conway, with its extensive ruins of a once vast\r\nand noble castle, through, under, and about the ruins of which the\r\ndouble lines of iron rails twist and twine and sinuously encoil\r\nthemselves like a boa constrictor of civilization and demolisher of\r\nwrecks, ruins, and vestiges of the feudal ages and semi-barbarism. Our\r\niron charger dashes up to the very walls of the ancient stronghold,\r\nclose past the base of a tower, and right under the hanging ruins of\r\nanother, which is in truth a \"baseless fabric,\" but no \"vision,\" for\r\nthere it is suspended in mid air, a fabric without a base, holding on to\r\nits surroundings by the cohesive power of their early attachments. We\r\nrush into the very bowels of the keep itself, snorting and puffing\r\ndefiance to the memoried sternness of the grim warriors who once held\r\nthe place against all intruders. Anyone who has not had an opportunity\r\nbefore of visiting North Wales should keep a sharp look-out right and\r\nleft, and they will get a peep at most of the principal places on the\r\nroute: the Welsh mountains on the left, their summits illuminated by the\r\nsun sinking towards the west, and the mass of them thrown into shadow in\r\nfine contrast.\r\n\r\nNow we are at Penmaenmawr, that pretty little watering place, with its\r\nneat-looking houses snugly nestling in the laps of the hills, and we\r\npass along so close to the sea, we can feel the spray from the waves as\r\nthey break on the shore.\r\n\r\nPassing Llanfairfechan and Aber we are at Bangor, and almost immediately\r\nafterwards make a dive into the long, dark chamber of the Tubular\r\nBridge, with a shriek and rumbling rattle that is almost startling. In\r\na few seconds we are out into the daylight again, and get a view of the\r\nStraits of Menai; and on the right-hand side, looking back, get an\r\nexcellent sight of the Tubular Bridge. At the moment of our passing, a\r\nship in full sail was running before the wind through the Straits, which\r\nadded considerably to the picturesque beauty of the scene. On the left a\r\nfine view of the \"Suspension Bridge\" is obtained. We are soon past\r\nLlanfair, and across that bleak and desolate part of the island of\r\nAnglesea between the Menai Straits and the Valley. Arriving at Holyhead,\r\nwe go on board the steamer which is to carry us across the Channel to\r\nDublin. The boat not starting immediately, but giving us a little time\r\nto look around, we go on shore again, and saunter up and down the narrow\r\nhilly streets of Holyhead, listening in vain for the sound of a word\r\nspoken in our mother tongue. Not a word could we hear, not a word of\r\nEnglish could we get without asking for it. The most of the people can\r\nspeak English with a foreign-like accent, but you seldom hear it unless\r\nyou address them in English. Even the urchins in the streets carry on\r\ntheir games and play in the Welsh and unintelligible sounds resembling\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nWe also had time to examine the stupendous breakwater which the\r\nGovernment is building at Holyhead to form a harbour of refuge. The wall\r\nis a mile and three-quarters in length, and of immense thickness, in the\r\nform of three terraces, the highest towards the sea. At one place we\r\nnoticed that the solid slatey rocks were hewn and dressed into shape,\r\nand thus formed part of the wall itself, a mixture of Nature's handiwork\r\nand the work of man.\r\n\r\nTime to go on board again, and as the wind was blowing rather strong, we\r\nexpected to have a rough voyage of it; and sure enough we had, for we\r\nwere scarcely clear of the sheltering kindliness of the sea wall and the\r\n\"north stack\" till our vessel began to \"pitch and toss,\" and roll and\r\ncreak, and groan in agony; and so highly sympathetic were we that we\r\ndid the same, and could not help it, do what we could. Strong tea,\r\nbrandy and water, were all no use. Down we went, like prostrate sinners\r\nas we were, on our knees, with clasped hands, praying for the winds and\r\nthe waves \"to be still;\" but they did not heed our prayer in the least,\r\nand kept up their inhumane howling, dancing, and jumbling until, by the\r\ntime we reached the middle of the Channel, we began to think that the\r\ncaptain had lost his course, and that we were somewhere between Holyhead\r\nand purgatory, if not in purgatory itself, being purged of our sins, and\r\nbecoming internally pure and externally foul. But we discovered that we,\r\nand not the captain, had lost the course and the even tenour of our way,\r\nfor we fancied--perhaps it was only fancy--that we could hear him\r\nhumming snatches of old song, among them \"Oh! steer my bark to Erin's\r\nIsle!\" and soon the mountains of Wicklow are in sight. As we near, and\r\nget under the lee of the land--for it was a stiff \"sou'-wester\" that\r\nbothered us--our sensations and feelings begin to improve, and we pick\r\nourselves up out of the mire, and turn our eyes eagerly and hopefully\r\ntowards the Emerald Isle, and Dublin Bay more particularly.\r\n\r\nAs we approach the Bay, the Carlingford Hills can be seen on the right,\r\nand a little more southwards Lambay and Ireland's Eye. The latter island\r\nis rugged and precipitous, seaward, in the extreme--a barren and\r\ndesolate-looking spot, possessing an unenviable notoriety on account of\r\nthe murder of a lady by her husband having been committed there a few\r\nyears ago: Howth, the light-house, and the Bailey Rock, where the _Queen\r\nVictoria_ steamer was wrecked, now attract our attention. And, as nearly\r\nas we can remember, these are the most striking features on the north\r\nside of the Bay. On the south the Harbour of Kingstown is distinctly\r\nvisible, and we saw the mail steamer which crosses from Holyhead to\r\nKingstown, a distance of sixty miles, in three and a half hours, blowing\r\noff her steam. By paying a little extra you can cross in the mail\r\nsteamers, if you wish, but it is not worth while paying the difference,\r\nas the ordinary steamers cross from Holyhead to Dublin in about five and\r\na half hours. All round the south side of the Bay we could trace the\r\nKingstown and Dublin railway, which is the oldest line but one in the\r\nUnited Queendoms of Great Britain and Ireland. An obelisk commemorates\r\nthe visit of the last of the four Georges to Ireland in 1821. Right\r\nover Kingstown the Killinny Hills are to be seen, and all along the\r\nwater-line the Bay is studded with pretty little villas, and the scene\r\nis truly beautiful. If possible, arrange your entrance into the Bay of\r\nDublin in the early morning, for then the sun, rising in the east,\r\nlights up the subjects to the very best advantage, and throws a charm\r\nabout them which they do not exhibit at any other time of the day. By\r\nwaiting at Holyhead for the early morning boat you can easily manage\r\nthis. But now we are at the North Wall, and on landing are besieged by\r\nCarmen to have a \"rowl,\" and jumping on to one of those light,\r\nodd-looking, jaunting cars which are one of the institutions of the\r\ncountry, we are \"rowled\" up the North Wall for nearly a mile, past the\r\nDocks, over the drawbridges, and past the Custom House--a large stone\r\nbuilding, too large for the business of the port--along Carlisle Bridge,\r\ndown Westmoreland Street, past the Bank of Ireland--once the Houses of\r\nParliament--and up Dame Street, leaving the College on our left, and\r\npassing King William's statue, representing a mounted Roman with\r\n_gilded_ laurels and ornamental toga, we arrive at Jury's Hotel, a\r\ncommercial and family house of superior arrangements which was well\r\nrecommended to us before we left London; and here we rest.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, and having made ourselves internally and externally\r\ncomfortable, we start for the Exhibition, which is within easy walking\r\ndistance of the hotel; but the car fares are so very moderate that we\r\nprefer a \"rowl.\" The fare is sixpence a \"set down;\" that is, you may\r\nride from one end of the city to the other for sixpence, but if you get\r\noff to post a letter, or buy an umbrella to keep the rain off--for the\r\ncars have no covering--that is a \"set down;\" and so every time you get\r\ndown and get up again you have sixpence to pay, no matter how short the\r\ndistance you are taken each time. So we hailed a car at the door of the\r\nhotel, determined to be \"rowled\" to the Exhibition for sixpence each. We\r\ngo down Dame Street, across College Green, up Grafton Street, along the\r\nwest and south sides of St. Stephen's Green or Square to Earlsfort\r\nTerrace and the principal entrance to the Dublin Exhibition, which\r\noccupies the site of what was formerly Coburg Gardens.\r\n\r\nArriving at the entrance-hall, we pay our admission fee, and on passing\r\nthe registering turnstiles we are at once in the sculpture hall on the\r\nground floor, the contents of which we shall notice more particularly\r\nby-and-by. Passing through the Sculpture Hall we are within the western\r\ntransept, or winter garden portion of the Exhibition. This transept is\r\n500 feet long and of lofty proportions, with galleries on each side, and\r\ntastefully hung with the banners and flags of the nations exhibiting.\r\nThe northern court is about 300 feet long, also of iron and glass, with\r\ngalleries running round both sides similar to the western transept. The\r\nground floor and part of the galleries of the northern court are devoted\r\nto the productions of the United Kingdom. On the north side of the\r\nnorthern court is the machinery department, both at rest and in motion.\r\nHere machines of the most delicate and ponderous nature are at work.\r\nThere a forge-hammer daintily cracking nuts, or coming down with a\r\ncrushing force at the will of the attendant. In another place a delicate\r\ncurving-machine is at work; and another can be seen making steel pens.\r\nThere are high pressure engines, sewing machines, and photographic\r\nrolling-presses. Indeed, there is almost everything to be seen and\r\neverything going on that is instructive, edifying, and amusing. The\r\nExhibition building is small, but well arranged and compact, and\r\npartakes of the character of an art and industrial exhibition and place\r\nof amusement and recreation, like our Crystal Palace at Sydenham, with\r\nornamental gardens and archery grounds attached. The gardens are\r\nsmall--a little larger than the area of the building itself--but most\r\ntastefully laid out. And there are fountains and grottoes, and rockeries\r\nand cascades, with flowers growing about them, which give the whole\r\nplace a pleasant, healthy, and delightful appearance. Stepping out of\r\nthe western transept into the gardens, we found the band of the 78th\r\nHighlanders playing in the centre, and their pipers walking about the\r\ngrounds ready to take up the strains of music in another key, for\r\npresently we saw them marching about, playing \"Hielan' Skirls,\" and\r\nsounding the loud pibroch, with a five-bag power that was more stunning\r\nthan the nocturnal wailings of a dozen or two Kilkenny cats. The\r\ndirectors furnish music and offer other inducements to secure a good\r\nattendance, and their efforts ought to be successful, and it is to be\r\nhoped they will be so.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of our visit there was a grand archery meeting, and the\r\nturn-out of Dublin belles was double in numbers. There was a large\r\nattendance of bowmen, too, and belles and beaux were banging away at the\r\ntargets most unmercifully in keen contest for the prize; whether it was\r\na medal, a ring, or an heiress, we could not learn; but if nothing more\r\nthan the privilege of entering the lists against such lovely\r\ncompetitors, the bowmen ought to have been satisfied; but we don't\r\nsuppose they were, for men are both ambitious and avaricious, and\r\nprobably some of them hoped to win a prize medal, kill a beauty, and\r\ncatch an heiress all at once, with one swift arrow sent whizzing and\r\nquivering into the very heart and gilded centre of the gaily-painted\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nPerched up on the top of the cascades we noticed a double sliding-front\r\nstereoscopic camera, and doubtless Mr. York was busy photographing the\r\nscene we have been describing--impressions of which the London\r\nStereoscopic Company will probably issue ere long. We must, however,\r\nleave this gay scene and turn our attention to other things, certainly\r\nnot more attractive; but duty calls us away from beauty, and we must\r\nsubmit.\r\n\r\nRe-entering the Exhibition building, we seek the photographic\r\ndepartment, which we readily find on the ground floor, between the music\r\nhall and the first-class refreshment-room. Entering from the Belgian\r\ndepartment in the western transept, we find three rooms in the main\r\nbuilding devoted to the exhibition of photographs, and a lobby between\r\nthe rooms pretty well filled with apparatus. To Sir J. Jocelyn Coghill\r\nare photographers indebted for obtaining so much space for their works,\r\nand in such a get-at-able situation; but it is a pity the rooms are not\r\nbetter lighted. Many of the pictures on the screens are very\r\nindistinctly seen, and some are in dark corners scarcely to be seen at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe foreign department, which is the first room we enter, is mainly made\r\nup of reproductions of old and modern engravings, and copies of drawings\r\nand paintings. One very remarkable photograph on the wall of this room\r\nis an immense magnification of a flea, by A. Duvette. What a subject for\r\nthe camera!--one that suggests in sporting phraseology something more\r\nthan the \"find,\" the \"chase,\" and the \"death.\"\r\n\r\nA panoramic view of Rome, by M. Petagna, is a great achievement in\r\npanoramic photography. There are seven impressions from 15 by 12 plates,\r\nall carefully joined, and of equal tone. The point of view is \"Tasso's\r\nOak,\" and the panorama gives us an excellent idea of Rome at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe British part of the Photographic Exhibition in Dublin might be very\r\nproperly denominated an enlargement of the Society's exhibition now open\r\nin Conduit Street, London. Nearly all the principal exhibitors there\r\nhave sent duplicates of their chief works to the Dublin Exhibition.\r\nThere is Robinson's beautiful picture of \"Brenda,\" his \"May Gatherers,\"\r\n\"Sunshine,\" \"Autumn,\" \"Somebody Coming,\" \"Bringing home the May,\" &c.,\r\nall old and familiar pictures, every one of which we have seen before.\r\nRobinson himself in his study--a beautiful piece of photography, even to\r\nhis black velvet coat. Blanchard also repeats his \"Zealot,\" and other\r\nsubjects, and sends a frame full of his exquisite stereographs. England\r\nalso sends some of his charming stereoscopic pictures of Switzerland and\r\nSavoy. Bedford's contribution is much the same as his pictures in the\r\nLondon exhibition. Among them are his lovely Warwickshire pictures.\r\nWet-plate photography is well represented, both in landscape,\r\nportraiture, and composition. Among the latter, Rejlander is most\r\nprominent. One frame containing some pictures showing the \"expression\"\r\nof the hands, illustrates Rejlander's artistic knowledge and ability\r\nmore than many of his other pictures. None but a thoughtful and\r\naccomplished artist could have disposed of those members in such a\r\nskilful manner. His pictures of \"Grief,\" \"The Mote,\" \"The Wayfarer,\"\r\n\"'Tis Light within--Dark without,\" and his \"Home, Sweet Home,\" reveal\r\nexquisite feeling in his treatment of such subjects. Thurston Thompson\r\nalso exhibits some of his fine reproductions of Turner. There is\r\n\"Crossing the Brook,\" and \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage;\" but a much\r\nlarger collection of these beautiful copies of Turner's pictures are now\r\non view at Marion's, in Soho Square.\r\n\r\nDry plate photography is exemplified in all its phases, from the oldest\r\nform of albumen alone, to the latest modifications with collodion,\r\ncollodio-albumen, Fothergill, tannin, malt, &c. The most prominent and\r\nlargest contributor to this department is Mr. Mudd. In addition to the\r\nduplicates in the London Exhibition, he sends a few others, the most\r\nremarkable of which is a large view of \"Borrowdale,\" a noble picture,\r\nexquisitely treated, showing masses of light and shade and pleasing\r\ncomposition which stamp it at once as a work of art.\r\n\r\nMr. G. S. Penny exhibits some very fine examples of the tannin and malt\r\nprocess. They are soft and delicate, and possess sufficient force to\r\ngive powerful contrasts when necessary. Mr. Bull's tannin and malt\r\npictures are also very good; his \"Menai Bridge\" particularly so.\r\n\r\nThe amateur photographers, both wet and dry, make a good show. And\r\namong the Irish followers of our delightful art are Sir J. J. Coghill,\r\nwho exhibits twelve very pretty views of the neighbourhood of\r\nCastletownsend. Dr. Hemphill, of Clonmel, also exhibits a variety of\r\nsubjects, many of them pretty compositions and excellent photography.\r\n\r\nDr. Bailey, of Monaghan, contributes both landscapes and portraits of\r\nvery good quality. Mr. T. M. Brownrigg shows seventeen photographs all\r\nexcellent examples of the wet collodion process. Many of them are\r\nexquisite bits of photography, and evince an amount of thought and care\r\nin selecting the best point of view, arranging the lines of the subject,\r\nand catching the best effect of light so as to make them pictures, which\r\nis seldom attended to by professional photographers.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Irish professional photographers in landscape work, Mr. F.\r\nMares, of Dublin, stands pre-eminent. His pictures of Killarney, and\r\nviews in the county of Wicklow, are very beautiful, and give evidence of\r\na cultivated eye and artistic taste in the selection of his subjects and\r\npoints of view. There are other excellent views and architectural\r\nsubjects by Irish photographers; but we are sorry to observe some that\r\nreally ought not to have been admitted. They are not even average\r\nphotography, being utterly destitute of manipulative skill, and as\r\ndeficient in art-excellence as they can well be.\r\n\r\nOne branch of landscape, or, we should say, marine photography, is\r\nwithout competition. We refer to those exquisite and charming\r\ntransparencies by Mr. C. S. Breese. His moonlight effect is wonderfully\r\nmanaged; the water looks \"alive,\" and the moonlight is dancing on the\r\nwaves just as we have seen it far away upon the sea. His \"Breaking Wave\"\r\nis marvellous, coming to shore with its cavernous curl; we almost fancy\r\nwe hear its angry howl as it dashes itself into foam on the beach. We\r\nhave seen such a wave sweep the deck of a ship before now, and know well\r\nwith what a ponderous weight and velocity it comes; and we wonder the\r\nmore at Mr. Breese's success in catching the wave in such a position. We\r\ncannot, however, speak so highly of the \"Sunlight\" effects by the same\r\nartist. The transparencies as photographs are inimitable; but there is\r\ncolour introduced into the skies which ought to have been taken up by\r\nthe rocks, and so carried into the foregrounds of the pictures, to be\r\nnatural. Such warm skies and cold middle distances and foregrounds are\r\ntoo antagonistic for the harmony of nature.\r\n\r\nIn portraiture, our Irish brethren of the camera contribute somewhat\r\nliberally. In that branch we noticed the works of Messrs. Robertson and\r\nCo., S. Lawrence, and G. Schroeder, of Grafton Street; Millard and\r\nRobinson, Nelson and Marshall, and S. Chancellor, of Sackville Street,\r\nDublin. T. Cranfield, Grafton Street, also exhibits some photographs\r\nbeautifully coloured in oil.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent English photographers also show up well. We saw the\r\nwell-known works of Mayall, Silvy, Claudet, Maull and Co., and others,\r\neminent in plain photography. Messrs. Lock and Whitfield exhibit a Royal\r\ncase of exquisitely coloured photographs of the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales, and Prince Albert Victor. Mr. G. Wharton Simpson also exhibits a\r\nfew specimens of his beautiful collodio-chloride of silver printing\r\nprocess. There are some lovely specimens of that process with such a\r\nfrightfully ugly name, but which, in plain parlance, are pictures on\r\nopal glass, though Mr. Helsby has christened them \"Helioaristotypia\r\nminiatures.\" As a set-off to this, the next dry process that is\r\ndiscovered should be called \"Hydrophobiatypia.\"\r\n\r\nIn amateur portraiture, Mr. H. Cooper, Jun., exhibits a large number of\r\nhis clever life studies, as well as those quiet and charming\r\nrepresentations of his friends in their habits as they live.\r\n\r\nSolar camera enlargements are very numerously contributed. Mr. Claudet\r\nsends some good pictures enlarged by solar camera, and developed with\r\ngallic acid. Mr. Salomon also has some very good examples of enlarging.\r\nDr. D. Van Monckhoven is an exhibitor of the capabilities of his direct\r\nprinting camera. Mr. Mayall exhibits two series of very interesting\r\nenlargements by the Monckhoven camera, printed direct on albumenized\r\npaper; one is Tennyson, in eight different sizes, from a one-ninth to a\r\nlife-size head on a whole sheet of paper; of the other, Captain Grant,\r\nthere are seven similar pictures. These photographs are all bold and\r\nvigorous and uniform in colour, and come nearer to our idea of what an\r\nenlargement should be than anything we have yet seen. Of the two, that\r\nof the Poet-Laureate is the best; the other is harsher, which is in all\r\nprobability due to the difference in the subjects themselves. We can\r\neasily imagine that the face of Captain Grant, bronzed and\r\nweather-beaten as it must be, will present more obstacles to the\r\nobtaining of a soft negative than that of Tennyson. Specimens of\r\nphoto-sculpture are also to be seen at the Dublin Exhibition, many of\r\nwhich are very pretty and life-like statuettes; but some of the figures\r\nseem much too large in the _busts_, and the plinths on which the figures\r\nof ladies stand are in very bad taste; being diminishing beads of a\r\ncircular form, they suggest the idea of a huge crinoline just dropped.\r\n\r\nNearly all the denominations of photography have their representative\r\nforms and impressions in this Exhibition; and the history of the art,\r\nfrom the early days of the Daguerreotype to the latest vagary of the\r\npresent day, may be traced in the collection of photographs spread\r\nbefore you on the walls and screens of the Dublin International\r\nExhibition. There is the Daguerreotype, the Ambrotype, and the\r\ncollodiotype, which ought to have been known as the Archertype; for the\r\nwet collodion process, although it is the most important of all the\r\ndiscoveries in photography that have been made since the first pictures\r\nwere obtained by Wedgwood, is without a name conferring honour on the\r\nman who first applied collodion to photography. Archer's name is\r\ngenerally associated with it, but without taking that definite and\r\nappellative form it ought to. We know that another claimant has been\r\n\"cutting in\" for the honour, but unless that claim can be \"backed up\" by\r\ndata, we are not disposed to believe that it was anterior to 1851--the\r\nyear of the first exhibition; at that date we know that Mr. Archer took\r\nphotographs on collodionized glass plates. Then why should we not honour\r\nArcher as the French honoured Daguerre, and call the wet collodion\r\nprocess the Archertype?\r\n\r\nIn printing and toning, there are samples of nearly all the formulae that\r\nhave been discovered since the days of printing on plain salted paper\r\nand fixing in \"hypo\" only. There are prints on plain paper and on\r\nalbumenized paper, toned and fixed in every conceivable way. There are\r\nprints on glass, porcelain, and ivory; prints in carbon, from the\r\nnegative direct; and impressions in printer's ink from plates, blocks,\r\nand lithographic stones, which have had the subjects transferred to them\r\nby the aid of photography. There are Wothlytypes, and Simpsontypes, and\r\nTooveytypes, and all the other types that have sprung from a desire to\r\nintroduce novelties into the art.\r\n\r\nIn graphs and the various forms and fanciful applications of photography\r\nto portraiture, &c., there are stereographs and micrographs, and the\r\nold-fashioned \"sit-on-a-chair\" graphs, the \"stand-not-at-ease\" graphs,\r\nthe \"small carte\" graph, the \"large carte\" graph, the \"casket gem\"\r\ngraph, the \"magnesium\" graph, the \"cameo\" graph, the \"double-stupid\"\r\ngraph, and the latest of all novelties, the \"turn-me-round\" graph. The\r\nlatter is a great curiosity, and must have been suggested by a\r\nrecollection of that \"scientific toy\" of ancient manufacture with which\r\nwe used to awaken the wonder of our little brothers and sisters at\r\nChristmas parties when we were boys, by twirling before their\r\nastonished eyes a piece of cardboard with a bird painted on one side and\r\na cage on the other, both pictures being seen at the same time during\r\nthe rapid revolution of the card.\r\n\r\nIn apparatus there is not much to talk about, the Pantascopic camera\r\nbeing the chief novelty. There are several of the manufacturers\r\nexhibiting in the photographic department, but we could not reconcile\r\nourselves to the circumstance of Mr. Dallmeyer not exhibiting in the\r\nright place. His name is honoured by photographers, and he should have\r\nhonoured Photography by going in under her colours. If he must go to the\r\n\"scientific department,\" he ought to have gone there with his scientific\r\ninstruments alone, and shown his photographic apparatus in the place\r\nassigned for that purpose. True, he makes a handsome show, but that does\r\nnot atone for his mistake. Photographers are queer animals--jealous of\r\ntheir rights, and as sensitive to slight as their plates are to light;\r\nand we fear we are ourselves not much better. A large majority of\r\nphotographers stand by Mr. Dallmeyer, and very justly believe in his\r\n1 and 2 B's as shippers do in A 1's at Lloyd's; and _his_ stand should\r\nhave been in the photographic department.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the Exhibition building there are various subjects\r\nhighly interesting to photographers.\r\n\r\nThe chemical department has its attractions in samples of\r\ncollodio-chloride of silver, prepared by Messrs. Mawson and Swan, for\r\nthe opal printing process and the Simpsontype. Specimens of each type\r\nare also to be seen there; and there are other chemicals used in\r\nphotography, even to dextrine and starch: the purity of the latter is\r\nknown by the size and length of its crystals.\r\n\r\nIn metallurgy there is also something to interest photographers. Messrs.\r\nJohnson and Sons exhibit some very fine samples of nitrate of silver,\r\ndouble and treble crystallized, silver dippers, chloride of gold,\r\nnitrate of uranium, and other scarce metals.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Johnson, Matthey, and Co. also exhibit some fine samples of\r\nnitrate of silver and chloride of gold; and some wonderful specimens of\r\nmagnesium, in various forms, in wire and ribbon. One coil of ribbon is\r\n4,800 feet long, and weighs 40 ounces; and there is an obelisk of\r\nmagnesium about 20 inches high, and weighing 162 ounces.\r\n\r\nThere are many other things in this case of great value which have a\r\nphotographic bearing--amongst these a platinum boiler, valued at L1,500,\r\nfor the concentration and rectification of sulphuric acid; a platinum\r\nalembic, value L350, for the separation and refining of gold and silver;\r\nalso an ingot of platinum, weighing 3,200 ounces, and valued at L3,840.\r\nThe exhibitors say that \"such a mass of fused platinum is never likely\r\nto be again produced.\" The whole of the contents of Messrs. Johnson,\r\nMatthey, and Co.'s case of precious metals, most of which have a direct\r\nor indirect application to photography, are estimated at the enormous\r\nvalue of L16,000!\r\n\r\nMining, too, has its attractions for us; and as we near the Nova Scotia\r\ndivision of the Exhibition building the needle of our observation dips\r\ntowards a bar of pure gold, weighing 48 pounds, and valued at L2,200\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nBy the gentlemanly courtesy of the Rev. Dr. Honeyman, Honorary Secretary\r\nand Commissioner in Dublin, from the province of Nova Scotia, we were\r\nfavoured with a \"lift\" of this valuable lump of gold, and we could not\r\nhelp exclaiming, \"What a lot of chloride this would make!\" But we had to\r\n\"drop it\" very quickly, for the muscles of our fingers could not bear\r\nthe strain of holding it more than a few seconds. This bar of gold was\r\nobtained from very rich quartz, specimens of which are to be seen near\r\nit; and Dr. Honeyman informed us that the average daily remuneration\r\nfrom such quartz was thirty shillings sterling per man.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that the province of Nova Scotia is so rich in\r\ngold; but, from statistics by the Chief Commissioner of Mines for the\r\nprovince, we find that the average yield of the Nova Scotia quartz is\r\nover 19 dwt. per ton, and richer than the quartz of Australia; and the\r\ndeeper the shafts are sunk the richer the quartz becomes. In 1864 the\r\ntotal yield from all the gold districts of Nova Scotia was 20,022\r\nounces, 18 dwts., 13 grs. Gold dust and scales have also been found in\r\nthe sands on the sea coast of the province, and in the sands of Sable\r\nIsland, which is eighty miles distant, in the Atlantic Ocean. Having in\r\nour own colonies such an abundance of one of the precious metals so\r\nextensively used in the practice of our art, photographers need not be\r\nunder any apprehension of having their supplies cut off.\r\n\r\nContinuing our general survey, we stumble upon many things of\r\nconsiderable interest. But, as our space will only allow us to\r\nparticularize those articles which have a photographic attraction,\r\ndirect or indirect, we must as far as possible imagine ourselves\r\nsomething like animated photometers for the time being, registering the\r\naspects, changes, and remarkable phenomena connected with our art, and\r\nwhatever can be applied to photography and the use of photographers; or\r\nwhatever photography can be applied to, artistically or commercially\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nOf some things non-photographic, but of interest to photographers as\r\nwell as others, we may be induced to say a little; but of most subjects\r\nforeign to our profession we shall simply say to our readers, \"We have\r\nseen such wondrous things, go ye and do likewise.\"\r\n\r\nWe finished our last paper with a few comments on what was\r\nphotographically interesting in the province of Nova Scotia. Passing\r\nfrom that to the provinces of the Lower and Upper Canadas, which are\r\nvery properly placed next door to each other, we are struck with some\r\nvery good and interesting photographs of Canadian scenery, both plain\r\nand in colours, and a frame of portraits of the delegates of the British\r\nNorth American Confederation. Samples of all kinds of native and Indian\r\nmanufactures, and specimens of mineral ores, chiefly iron and copper,\r\nare also displayed here.\r\n\r\nPursuing our way southwards from the Colonial division of the galleries,\r\nwe come to China and Japan. The geographical and relative positions of\r\nthe countries exhibiting are not strictly adhered to in the plan of the\r\nExhibition, so we must, of necessity, make some \"long legs,\" and\r\nexperience some imaginary transitions of temperature during our journey\r\nof observation. In Japan we stop to look at a life-size group of female\r\nfigures, representing a princess at her toilette, attended by four\r\nfemale slaves, books illustrated with wood-cuts, plain and coloured,\r\nbronzes, and many other articles of art and manufacture, by the\r\nJapanese, of much interest.\r\n\r\nIn China, there is a State bedstead of great beauty, books of paintings\r\nupon rice-paper, and many beautiful bronzes, carvings, and other\r\nspecimens of Chinese art.\r\n\r\nWe pass through Turkey, and next come to Siam, but the latter country\r\ndoes not exhibit much, except of a \"seedy\" character. We admit we are\r\nsometimes addicted to making puns, but the Siamese send puns for\r\nexhibition. There is an article called \"pun,\" which is \"prepared lime,\r\ncoloured pink with turmeric,\" but to what use it is applied we have not\r\nbeen enlightened.\r\n\r\nPassing through France, Austria, Prussia, Belgium, and Holland, without\r\nstopping to notice anything particularly, and turning into the south\r\ncorridor, we enter the Water Colour Gallery, which we quickly leave,\r\nsighing, \"How unlike that beautiful and attractive section of the Art\r\nTreasure Exhibition at Manchester in 1857!\" Hastening into the Central\r\nPicture Gallery, we are much struck with the different appearance it\r\npresents, and find numbers of ladies and gentlemen admiring the numerous\r\nproductions by painters belonging to the various foreign schools. Among\r\nthese works are some grand subjects, both in historical and ideal\r\ncomposition, and landscape representations. This gallery has a\r\nparticularly noble and handsome appearance. It is oblong, well-lighted,\r\nand open in the middle, by which means the Sculpture Hall, which is\r\nunderneath, is lighted. The sides of the gallery next the open space are\r\nhandsomely railed round, and pedestals, with marble busts and statuettes\r\non them, are tastefully arranged at intervals, leaving room enough for\r\nyou to look down into the Sculpture Hall below. What with the fine\r\npictures on the walls and staircase, and the noble statues in marble\r\nabout and below, you cannot but come to the conclusion that this is a\r\nnoble temple of art.\r\n\r\nWe next enter the east front room, which contains the works of the\r\nBelgian artists. Many of these paintings are very finely conceived and\r\nexecuted. The largest and most striking of them is the \"Defeat of the\r\nDuke of Alencon's Troops by the Citizens of Antwerp,\" painted by A.\r\nDillens.\r\n\r\nNow we enter the Great Picture Gallery, which is devoted to the painters\r\nbelonging to the British school. Here we find many of the well-known\r\nworks from the National Gallery and Kensington Museum. There are\r\nexamples of the works of Callcott, Collins, Wilkie, Wilson, Turner,\r\nLandseer, Mulready, Etty, Egg, Ward, Leslie, and a host of others. Her\r\nMajesty the Queen also sends several pictures from her private\r\ncollection, as examples of the works of Winterhalter, Thomas, and\r\nStanfield. Nearly all the British artists are creditably represented in\r\nthe Dublin International Art Exhibition.\r\n\r\nWe next come to the Collection of Ancient Masters in the North Gallery,\r\nwhich we enter from the North Corridor. To this part of the Fine Art\r\nExhibition the Earl of Portarlington is the most liberal contributor. He\r\nsends examples of Titian, Rubens, Carlo Dolci, Tintoretto, Canalette,\r\nClaude, Watteau, Rembrandt, Gerard Dow, Schneiders, Vandevelde, Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds, Sir Peter Lely, and others. The Marquis of Drogheda\r\nalso sends several examples of the same masters, some of them very fine\r\nones. Sir Charles Coote sends a great many paintings; among them a\r\nMurillo, a Guido, and a Gainsborough.\r\n\r\nThence we pass into the Mediaeval Court, where we find nothing but\r\ncroziers, sacramental cups and plates, carved panels for pulpits and\r\nclerks' desks, reminding us of \"responses\" and \"amens.\" These we leave\r\nto Churchmen, enthusiastic Puseyites, and devotees of Catholicism. And\r\nwe wend our way round the galleries, passing through Switzerland and\r\nItaly into the United Kingdom, where we stop to examine some of the art\r\nmanufactures peculiar to Ireland, and are particularly interested in the\r\nspecimens of Irish bog oak, carved most tastefully into various\r\nornaments, such as brooches, pins, paper-knives, &c., and sculptured\r\ninto humorous and characteristic statuettes. The most noticeable of that\r\nclass of Irish art and industry is a clever group, entitled, \"Where's\r\nthe man that dare tread on my coat?\" This really humorous and artistic\r\nstatuette is one of a group of two. One is a rollicking Irishman\r\nbrandishing his shillelagh over his head and trailing his coat on the\r\nground, which is the Irishman's challenge for a fight at such places as\r\nDonnybrook Fair. The other Irishman, who is equally ready for a \"row,\"\r\nis in the act of treading on the coat, as an acceptance of the\r\nchallenge. The story is so cleverly told, that we almost fancy we see\r\nthe fight begin, and hear the shillelaghs cracking crowns in a genuine\r\nIrish row.\r\n\r\nPushing on through India to the British Colonies again, whence we\r\nstarted, we descend to the ground floor, and resume our survey of\r\nSweden, Norway, Italy, and Rome, and turn into the Music Hall, which is\r\non the south side of the entrance and Statuary Hall. Here we find the\r\norgan builders at work on the grand organ, blowing up one pipe after\r\nanother, and producing such volumes of inharmonious sounds that we are\r\nglad to leave them to the full and hearty enjoyment of their pipes,\r\nchords, discords, and bellows-blowing. The walls of the Music Hall are\r\nnearly covered with cartoons and paintings of a high-class, some of\r\nthem so high that we require an opera-glass to bring them within the\r\nrange of our visual organs.\r\n\r\nWe next enter the Sculpture Hall with a view of examining the statues\r\nand describing them carefully. But they are so numerous that we can only\r\nfind space to call attention to the most striking. There are over three\r\nhundred pieces of sculpture from various countries, comprising colossal\r\nand life-size figures, groups, busts, statuettes, and alto-relievos in\r\nmarble and bronze. The most attractive of the marble statues are\r\n\"Michael Angelo, when a child, sculpturing the head of a Faun\" (his\r\nfirst work), by Emilio Zocchi, of Florence. The earnestness of purpose\r\nand devotion to his task are wonderfully expressed in the countenance of\r\nthe boy-sculptor. Plying the hammer and chisel actively and vigorously,\r\nevery part of the figure betokens a thorough abandonment to his\r\noccupation. A very remarkable work by a lady sculptor--Miss Harriett\r\nHosmer--entitled \"The Sleeping Faun,\" is the very opposite to the other,\r\nin its complete abandonment to repose. This fine statue has been\r\npurchased by Mr. Guiness, and we were told he had given a munificent sum\r\nfor it. Another piece of exquisite beauty and daring skill in marble\r\nworking is \"The Swinging Girl,\" by Pietro Magni, of Milan, the sculptor\r\nof \"The Reading Girl,\" which attracted so much attention in the\r\nInternational Exhibition of 1862. The figure of the girl swinging is\r\nbeautifully modelled, and entirely free from contact with the base; and\r\nis supported only by the swing attached to the branch of a tree, and the\r\nhand of a boy giving action to the subject. \"Ophelia,\" by W. C.\r\nMarshall, is perhaps the most poetic conception of the loveliest and\r\nmost mournful of Shakespeare's creations that has ever been sculptured.\r\nIt is almost impossible to look at this touching representation of\r\nOphelia in her madness without exclaiming, in a modified quotation of\r\nher own description of Hamlet--\r\n\r\n  \"O, what a gentle mind is here o'erthrown.\"\r\n\r\nBut we must stop. To go on in this way describing all the beautiful\r\nworks of art in the Dublin Exhibition would fill a volume. Already we\r\nhave allowed our admiration to carry us beyond the limits we had\r\nassigned ourselves. We have been tempted to describe more than\r\nphotographic works, but none that have not a value artistically or\r\notherwise to photographers. We recommend all our readers that possibly\r\ncan to go and see for themselves. The trip is a very pleasant one, and\r\nneed not be expensive; nor need much time be spent unnecessarily. A\r\nweek's absence from business will give you five clear days in Dublin,\r\nthe other two only being occupied in travelling. Five days will be amply\r\nsufficient to see the Exhibition and the \"extraneous lions\" of Dublin\r\nalso. If your time is limited, give a carman a job to \"rowl\" you to the\r\nprincipal places of interest. But \"by all means\" select a rough, ragged,\r\nred-headed, laughing-faced Irishman for your jarvey, and depend upon it\r\nhe will keep you in good humour during the whole of your trip. And every\r\ntime you come to a public-house he will say his \"horse wants a dthrink,\"\r\nand \"Won't yer honours have a dthrop?\" as if he was going to stand\r\ntreat; but of course you know what he means; besides, the idea of\r\nallowing a carman to treat his fare is not to be entertained for a\r\nmoment, nor can you resist the good-humoured intimation of his desire to\r\ndrink your health, for which honour, as a matter of course, you pay\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\nHaving endeavoured to conduct our readers to Dublin, and give them a\r\nglance at the Exhibition, photographically and generally, we shall now\r\ntake our leave of the capital of Ireland, and return to town in much the\r\nsame manner as we went. We leave the Irish capital at 1.30 in the\r\nafternoon, and, after a pleasant and quiet run across the Channel, enter\r\nHolyhead harbour about seven o'clock. This arrangement gives you an\r\nopportunity of seeing the Welsh coast to the best advantage as you\r\napproach. Stepping into the train which is waiting our arrival, we are\r\nspeedily on our way home. At Rugby we have to change, and wait a little;\r\nbut before leaving there we pass the sign which only old masons and\r\ntravellers know, and are provided with a first-class bed and _board_,\r\nand so make ourselves comfortable for the night. We know nothing more of\r\nthe remainder of the journey. Old Somnus has charge of us inside, and an\r\nold kind-hearted guard takes care of us outside, until we are aroused by\r\nthe guard's \"Good morning, gentlemen!\" about six o'clock, a.m., within a\r\nfew miles of Euston Square. In conclusion, we sincerely recommend as\r\nmany of our readers as can to take a trip \"to Dublin and back,\" and a\r\nglance at the Dublin International Exhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY IN THE NORTH.\r\n\r\nOn a recent journey northwards, I was tempted to stop at York, take a\r\nlook at the Exhibition there, and see if there were anything worth\r\nnotice in the Photographic Department. That part of the Exhibition is\r\nexceedingly scanty, but the best Yorkshire photographers are well\r\nrepresented, both in landscape and portraiture. Among the contributors\r\nare the names of Sarony, Glaisby, Holroyd, Gowland, and other well-known\r\nnames. Mr. Sarony exhibits a couple of frames containing several \"new\r\nphoto-crayons,\" cartes-de-visite vignettes, which are very sketchy and\r\neffective, exhibiting those free and \"dashy lines\" and \"hatchings\" so\r\ncharacteristic of the \"softening off\" of artistic crayon drawings. This\r\neffect may be produced by a process of double printing, but it is more\r\nlikely to have been obtained direct in the camera from a screen, having\r\nthe edges of the aperture \"softened off\" with some free touches, the\r\nscreen, in all probability, being placed between the lens and the\r\nsitter. Mr. Sarony also exhibits some large photographs very beautifully\r\nfinished in colours. Messrs. Gowland exhibit, in a revolving case, a\r\nvery unique collection of medallions and vignettes, both plain and\r\ncoloured, mounted on tinted grounds, which give the pictures a very\r\nchaste and delicate appearance. The photographs themselves are exquisite\r\nbits of artistic pose and careful manipulation. They also exhibit a\r\ncharming vignette of twenty-nine young ladies, all cleverly arranged,\r\neach figure sharp and distinct, and evidently recognisable portraits.\r\nThis picture reminds one of Watteau, for the figures are in the woods,\r\nonly, instead of semi-nude nymphs, the sitters are all properly and\r\nfashionably dressed young ladies. Messrs. Holroyd contribute some very\r\nexcellent cartes-de-visite and enlargements. Mr. E. C. Walker, of\r\nLiverpool, exhibits some very beautiful opalotypes, or \"photographs on\r\nenamelled glass.\" Mr. Swan, Charing Cross, London, also sends specimens\r\nof his crystal cube portraits. Mr. A. H. Clarke, a deaf and dumb\r\nphotographer, exhibits some very good groups of the Princess of Wales,\r\nLady Wharncliffe, Lady Maud Lascelles, Countess Granville, and the Hon.\r\nMrs. Hardinge, taken in the conservatory, when the Princess and suite\r\nwere on a visit to Studley Royal, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nAmongst the landscape photographs are to be found some of Bedford's\r\nfinest views of Egypt and Jerusalem, Devonshire and Warwickshire, the\r\nbeauties of which are so well-known to everyone interested in\r\nphotography. Some of the local views by local artists are very fine; W.\r\nP. Glaisby's views of York Minster are capital, especially the\r\ninteriors. Messrs. Jackson Brothers, of Oldham, exhibit some very fine\r\nviews, and show what atmospheric effects the camera is capable of\r\nrendering. That view of \"Birstall Church\" is a perfect master-piece of\r\nphoto-aerial perspective. There are also a considerable number of\r\nphotographic productions from the South Kensington Museum. Mr. Gregson,\r\nof Halifax, exhibits some excellent photographs of machinery. In\r\napparatus there is nothing novel or striking, there being but one case\r\nof cameras, &c., exhibited by a London maker. There is a \"water\r\nagitator\" in the machinery \"annexe,\" for washing photographic prints,\r\nbut the invention is more ingenious than effective, for the water is not\r\nagitated sufficiently, except in the immediate neighbourhood of the fan\r\nor \"agitator,\" which moves backwards and forwards in the water, in a\r\nmanner somewhat similar to the motion of the pendulum of a clock, and so\r\nlaves the water to and fro; but the force is not sufficient to prevent\r\nthe prints from lying close together at the extremities of the trough,\r\nand imperfect washing is sure to be the result. The motion is given to\r\nthe \"agitator\" by the water falling on a small wheel, something like\r\n\"Williams's revolving print washing machine.\"\r\n\r\nTo describe the Exhibition itself: It is rather like a \"compound\r\nmixture\" of the church, the shop, and the show. The \"Great Hall\" is\r\nsomething like the nave of a wooden cathedral, with galleries running\r\nall round, and a grand organ at the end, peeling forth, at intervals,\r\nsolemn strains of long measure. Over the organ, in white letters on a\r\nred ground, is the quotation, \"He hath made all things beautiful in his\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nThe show cases on the floor of the Grand Hall are arranged as\r\nindiscriminately as the shops in Oxford Street. In one case there are\r\nexhibited samples of Colman's mustard, in that next to it samples of\r\n\"Elkington and Co.'s plated goods,\" and in another close by are samples\r\nof saddlery, which give the place more the business aspect of a bazaar\r\nthan the desirable and advantageous classification of an exhibition.\r\nThen you are reminded of the show by the frequent ringing of a loud\r\nbell, and cries of \"This way to the fairy fountain, just going to begin,\r\nonly twopence.\" Such things jar on the ears and nerves of quiet\r\nvisitors, and are only expected in such a place as the Polytechnic in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe great features of the York Exhibition are the picture galleries; and\r\nhere a better order of things prevails. The collections are classified;\r\none gallery, or part of it, being devoted to the works of the old\r\nmasters, another to the modern, and another to the water-colours. Among\r\nthe old masters are some fine portraits by Velasquez, Tintoretto,\r\nRembrandt, Vandyke, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Gainsborough, Sir Peter Lely,\r\nand others. And some of those grand old landscapes by Salvator Rosa,\r\nRubens, Claude, Wilson, the English Claude, and George Morland, such\r\npictures as are rarely seen out of private collections. The modern\r\nmasters are abundantly represented by Wilkie, Etty, Frith, Westall,\r\nFaed, Cope, E. Nicol, Stanfield, Linnell, and a host of others. Amongst\r\nthe water-colours are many fine examples of the works of Turner, the\r\nRichardsons (father and sons), Birket Foster, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nSculpture is very faintly represented, but there is a charming little\r\nCanova, Dirce, exhibited by Lord Wenlock; an antique bust of Julius\r\nCaesar, which seems to have been found in fragments and carefully joined\r\ntogether. This bust is exhibited by the Hon. P. Downay, and was found in\r\nRome amongst some rubbish, while some excavations were being made. There\r\nis also an interesting series of marble busts of the Twelve Caesars,\r\nexhibited by Lord Londesborough. The Exhibition is open in the evening,\r\nand brilliantly lighted with gas till ten o'clock; and, taking it \"all\r\nin all,\" it is a very creditable effort in the right direction, and does\r\nhonour to York and Yorkshiremen.\r\n\r\nFurther north still, at Newcastle-on-Tyne, there is another exhibition\r\nof \"Arts and Manufactures,\" the chief photographic feature of which is a\r\nconsiderable display of \"Swan's Carbon Prints,\" from several well-known\r\nnegatives by Bedford and Robinson. The promise of this process is very\r\ngreat, and its commercial advantages were singularly demonstrated to me\r\nwhen visiting the printing establishment of Mr. Swan, which I happened\r\nto do on a dark and unfavourable day--one totally unfit for silver\r\nprinting; and yet I saw several very beautiful carbon prints that had\r\nbeen produced that day, the rate of production being about eight to one\r\nover silver printing. As a proof of the certainty and commercial\r\napplication to which Mr. Swan has reduced his beautiful process, I need\r\nonly mention that he has undertaken the printing of two thousand copies\r\nof the celebrated picture of \"The First General Assembly of the Church\r\nof Scotland,\" painted by D. O. Hill. This historical picture contains\r\nfour hundred and fifty portraits: the negatives were taken from the\r\noriginal painting by Mr. Annan, photographer, Glasgow, and are 32 by 14\r\ninches, and 24 by 9 inches; and Mr. Swan has to turn off one thousand\r\ncopies of each within a given time. The publishers of the work give a\r\nguarantee to their subscribers that every print shall be of a high\r\nstandard, for each one has to pass the examination of two competent\r\njudges. They also very justly pride themselves on being the very first\r\nto translate and multiply such noble works of art by a process \"so\r\nbeautiful, and, at the same time, _imperishable_.\" I saw several of the\r\nprints, both in process of development and complete; and anything more\r\nlike rich, soft, and brilliant impressions of a fine mezzotint engraving\r\nI never saw, by any process of photography.\r\n\r\nMr. Swan's arrangements for conducting the various parts of his process\r\nare very extensive and complete; and his mode of \"developing and\r\ntransferring\" seems to be the very acme of perfection. But, as Mr. Swan\r\nis about to publish a work containing a full description of the process,\r\nwith a beautiful specimen print as frontispiece, I will not anticipate\r\nhim, or mar his own comprehensive account of the details of a process\r\nwhich he has brought to such a state of beauty and perfection, by an\r\namount of patient perseverance and thoughtful application rarely\r\nexhibited or possessed by one individual.\r\n\r\nI also visited the photographic establishment of Messrs. Downey in\r\nNewcastle, and there saw some _cabinet pictures_ of the Princess of\r\nWales, taken recently at Abergeldie Castle. Messrs. Downey have just\r\nreturned from Balmoral with upwards of two hundred negatives, including\r\nwhole-plate, half-plate, and _cabinet_ size, which will be published in\r\none or all those sizes, as soon as the orders of Her Majesty have been\r\nexecuted. From the well-known reputation of the Messrs. Downey as\r\nphotographers, it is, in all probability, a treat in store for the\r\nlovers of photography, to get a sight of their latest works at Balmoral\r\nand Abergeldie.\r\n\r\nMr. Parry, another excellent photographer in Newcastle, was also making\r\narrangements to introduce the new cabinet size picture in a style that\r\nwill insure its success.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the movements of the best photographers in the North are\r\nhighly commendable, and, with their notoriously practical minds, there\r\nis little doubt of their undertakings becoming a success. Let us hope\r\nthat the same elements of energy and \"push\" will speedily impregnate the\r\nminds of all photographers, and create a combination that will develop a\r\nnew form of popular beauty, and result in forming a salt that will\r\nsavour their labours, produce deposits of gold, and create innumerable\r\norders of merit.\r\n\r\n\r\nERRORS IN PICTORIAL BACKGROUNDS.\r\n\r\nWe have recently had a few papers on the necessity of art culture and\r\nart knowledge in relation to photography, but they have chiefly been of\r\na theoretical and speculative character, few, if any, assuming a\r\npractical form. \"Apply the rod to teach the child\" is an old saying, and\r\nour artist friends and teachers _have_ applied the rod and belaboured\r\nphotography most unmercifully, but they have _not_ taught the child.\r\nThey have contented themselves with abusing photographers for not doing\r\nwhat was right, instead of teaching them how to avoid what was wrong.\r\n\r\nIt will be my endeavour to point out, in this paper, some errors that\r\nhave crept into photographers' and artists' studios, and I hope to be\r\nable to suggest a remedy that will lessen these evils, and elevate\r\nphotography in the scale of art. The faults in pictorial backgrounds\r\nthat I invite your attention to, arise from the neglect of the\r\nprinciples of linear and aerial perspective. I do not speak of the\r\nerrors in perspective that may exist in the backgrounds themselves,\r\nviewing them as pictures; but I refer to the manifest fault of depicting\r\nthe sitter--the principal object--according to one condition of\r\nperspective, and the background that is placed behind him according to\r\nanother. An unpardonable error in any work of art, whether photograph or\r\npainting, is to represent a natural object in an unnatural position. By\r\nthis I do not mean an awkward and constrained attitude, but a false\r\nposition of the principal subject in relation to the other objects by\r\nwhich it is surrounded. We frequently see portraits, both full-length\r\nand three-quarter size, with landscape backgrounds--or a bit of\r\nlandscape to be seen through a painted or actual window--of the most\r\nunnatural proportions in relation to the figure itself. The head of the\r\nsubject is stuck high in the heavens--sometimes so high that, in\r\nrelation to the painted landscape, nothing shorter than a church steeple\r\ncould attain such an altitude. The trees and castles of the pretty\r\nlandscape, supposed to be behind the sitter, are like children's toys;\r\nthe mountains are like footballs in size, and the \"horizon\" is not so\r\nmuch in relation to the figure as the width of a fishpond is to a man\r\nstanding on one side of it. It must be admitted that artists themselves\r\nhave set this bad example of departing from truth to give increased\r\nimportance to their subjects by placing their figures against diminutive\r\nbackgrounds; but that is a liberty taken with nature which photographers\r\nshould neither imitate nor allow. Photography is, in all other respects,\r\nso rigidly truthful that it cannot consistently sanction such a\r\nviolation of natural laws.\r\n\r\nPictorial backgrounds have usually been painted on the same principle as\r\na landscape picture, and one of the earliest things the painter has to\r\ndetermine is, where he shall represent that line where the sky and\r\nearth appear to meet--technically, the _horizontal line_. This settled,\r\nall the lines, not vertical or horizontal in the picture, below this are\r\nmade to appear to rise up to it, and those above descend, and if all\r\nthese are in due proportion the perspective is correct, no matter\r\nwhether this governing line is assumed to be in the upper, lower, or\r\nmiddle part of the picture. A painter can suppose this imaginary line to\r\nbe at any height he pleases in his picture, and paint accordingly. In\r\nphotography it is invariable, and is always on a level with the lens of\r\nthe camera. To illustrate the relation of the horizontal line to the\r\nhuman figure, when a pictorial background is to be introduced, let us\r\nimagine that we are taking a portrait out-of-doors, with a free and open\r\ncountry behind the person standing for his carte-de-visite. The camera\r\nand the model are, as a matter of course, on the same level. Now focus\r\nthe subject and observe the linear construction of the landscape\r\nbackground of nature. See how all the lines of the objects below the\r\nlevel of the lens run up to it, and the lines of the objects above run\r\ndown to it. Right across the lens is the horizontal line, and the centre\r\nis the point of sight, where all the lines will appear to converge.\r\nSuppose the lens to be on a level with the face of the subject, the\r\nhorizontal line of the picture produced on the ground glass will be as\r\nnear as possible as high as the eyes of the subject. Trees and hills in\r\nthe distance will be above, and the whole picture will be in harmony.\r\nThis applies to interior views as well, but the ocular demonstration is\r\nnot so conclusive, for the converging lines will be cut or stopped by\r\nthe perpendicular wall forming the background. Nevertheless, all the\r\nconverging lines that are visible will be seen to be on their way to the\r\npoint of sight. Whether a natural background consisted of an interior,\r\nor comprised both--such as a portion of the wall of a room and a peep\r\nthrough a window on one side of the figure--the conditions would be\r\nexactly the same. All the lines above the lens must come down, and all\r\nthat are below must go up. The following diagrams will illustrate this\r\nprinciple still more clearly.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is a section of the linear construction of a picture, and will\r\nshow how the lines converge from the point of observation to the point\r\nof sight. Artists, in constructing a landscape of an ordinary form,\r\nallot to the sky generally about twice the space between the base and\r\nhorizontal lines. But for portraits and groups, where the figures are of\r\nthe greatest importance and nearer to the eye, the proportion of sky and\r\nearth is reversed, so as to give increased value to the principal\r\nfigures, by making them apparently larger, and still preserving the\r\nproper relation between them and the horizontal line (see fig. 2). This\r\ndiagram represents the conditions of a full-length carte portrait, where\r\nthe governing horizontal line is on a level with the camera. If a\r\npictorial background, painted in the usual way, with the horizontal line\r\nlow in the picture, is now placed behind the sitter, the resulting\r\nphotograph will be incongruous and offensive. It will be seen, on\r\nreferring to fig. 2, that all the lines below the horizon must of\r\nnecessity run up to it, no matter how high the horizontal line may be,\r\nfor it is impossible to have two horizons in one picture; that is, a\r\nvisible horizon in the landscape background, and an imaginary one for\r\nthe figure, with the horizontal line of the background far below the\r\nhead of the figure, and the head far up in the sky. The head of a human\r\nfigure can only be seen so far above the horizontal line under certain\r\nconditions; such as being elevated above the observer by being mounted\r\non horseback, standing on higher ground, or otherwise placed\r\nconsiderably above the base line, none of which conditions are present\r\nin a studio. Whenever the observed and observer are on the same level,\r\nas must be the case when a photographer is taking the portrait of a\r\nsitter in his studio, the head of the subject could not possibly be seen\r\nso high in the sky, if the lens included a natural background instead of\r\na painted one. As, for convenience, the painted background is intended\r\nto take the place of a natural one, care should be taken that the linear\r\nand aerial perspectives should be as true to nature as possible, and in\r\nperfect harmony with the size of the figures. The lens registers, on the\r\nprepared plate, the relative proportions of natural objects as\r\nfaithfully as the retina receives them through the eye, and if we wish\r\nto carry out the illusion of pictorial backgrounds correctly, we _must_\r\nhave the linear construction of the picture, which is intended to\r\nrepresent nature, as true in every respect as nature is herself.\r\n\r\nAerial perspective has not been sufficiently attended to by the painters\r\nof pictorial backgrounds. There are many other subjects in connection\r\nwith art and photography that might be discussed with advantage--such as\r\ncomposition, arrangement of accessories, size, form, character, and\r\nfitness of the things employed; but I leave all these for another\r\nopportunity, or to someone more able to handle the subjects. For the\r\npresent, I am content to point out those errors that arise from\r\nneglecting true perspective, and while showing the cause, distinctively\r\nsupply a remedy.\r\n\r\nIt is not the fault of perspective in the background where the lines are\r\nnot in harmony with each other--these too frequently occur, and are\r\neasily detected--but it is the error of painting a pictorial background\r\nas if it were an independent picture, without reference to the\r\nconditions under which it is to be used. The conditions of perspective\r\nare determined by the situation of the lens and the sitter. If the\r\nactual objects existed behind the sitter, and were photographed\r\nsimultaneously with the sitter, the same laws of perspective would\r\ngovern the two. What I urge is, that if, instead of the objects, a\r\nrepresentation of them be put behind the sitter, that representation be\r\nalso a correct one. The laws of perspective teach how it may be made\r\ncorrectly, and the starting point is the position of the lens in\r\nrelation to the sitter.\r\n\r\nSome may say that these conditions of painting a background cannot be\r\ncomplied with, as the lens and sitter are never twice exactly in the\r\nsame relation to each other. There is less force in this objection than\r\nat first appears. Each photographer uses the same lens for all his\r\n_carte_ portraits--and pictorial backgrounds are very frequently used\r\nfor these--and the height of his camera, as well as the distance from\r\nhis sitter, are so nearly constant, that the small amount of errors thus\r\ncaused need not be recognized. If the errors that exist were not far\r\nmore grave, there would be no necessity for this paper. Exceptional\r\npictures should have corresponding backgrounds.\r\n\r\nWhen a \"sitter\" is photographed standing in front of a pictorial\r\nbackground, the photograph will represent him either standing in a\r\nnatural scene, or before a badly-painted picture. Nobody should\r\nwittingly punish his sitter by doing the latter when he could do the\r\nformer, and the first step to form the desirable illusion is pictorial\r\ntruth. There is no reason why the backgrounds should not be painted\r\ntruthfully and according to correct principles, for the one is as easy\r\nas the other. I daresay the reason is that artists have not\r\nintentionally done wrong--it would be too bad to suppose that--but they\r\nhave treated the backgrounds as independent pictures, and it is for\r\nphotographers to make what use of them they think proper. The real\r\nprinciples are, however, now stated, by which they can be painted so as\r\nto be more photographically useful, and artists and photographers have\r\nalike the key to pictorial truth.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would suggest to photographers the necessity of\r\nstudying nature more carefully--to observe her in their walks abroad, to\r\nnotice the gradual decrease of objects both in size and distinctness, to\r\nremember that their lens is to their camera what their eye is to\r\nthemselves, to give as faithful a transcript of nature as they possibly\r\ncan, to watch the flow of nature's lines, as well as natural light and\r\nshade, and, by a constant study and exhibition of truth and beauty in\r\ntheir works, make photography eventually the teacher of art, instead of\r\nart, as is now the case, being the reviler of photography.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSPECTIVE.\r\n\r\n_To the Editors._\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--At the end of Mr. Alfred H. Wall's reply to Mr. Carey Lea's\r\nletter on _Artists and Photographers_, I notice that he cautions your\r\nreaders not to receive the very simple rules of perspective laid down in\r\nmy paper, entitled _Errors in Pictorial Backgrounds_, until they have\r\nacquired more information on the subject. Allow me to state that all I\r\nsaid on perspective in that paper only went to show that there should be\r\nbut one horizon in the same picture; that the lines of all objects\r\n_below_ that horizon should run up to it; that the lines of all objects\r\n_above_ should run down, no matter where that _one_ horizon was placed;\r\nand that the horizon of the landscape background should be in due\r\nrelation to the sitter and on a level with the eye of the observer, the\r\nobserver being either the lens or the painter.\r\n\r\nIf your correspondent considers that I was in error by laying down such\r\nplain and common sense rules, which everyone can see and judge for\r\nhimself by looking down a street, then I freely admit that your\r\ncorrespondent knows a great deal more about _false_ perspective than I\r\ndo, or should like to do.\r\n\r\nAgain, if your correspondent cannot see why I \"volunteered to instruct\r\nartists\" or painters of backgrounds, perhaps he will allow me to inform\r\nhim that I did so simply because background painters have hitherto\r\nsupplied photographers with backgrounds totally unfit for use in the\r\nphotographic studio.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Mr. Wall's assumption of superior knowledge on subjects\r\nrelating to art, I may still be able to give him a hint how to produce a\r\npictorial background that will be much more natural, proportionate, and\r\nsuitable for the use of photographers than any hitherto painted.\r\n\r\nLet Mr. Wall, or any other background painter, go _out_ with the camera\r\nand take a _carte-de-visite_ portrait out-of-doors, placing the subject\r\nin any well-chosen and suitable natural scene, and photograph the\r\n\"sitter\" and the natural scene at the same time. Then bring the picture\r\nso obtained into his studio and enlarge it up to \"life-size,\" which he\r\ncan easily do by the old-fashioned system of \"squaring,\" or, better\r\nstill, by the aid of a magic lantern, and with the help of a sketch of\r\nthe scene as well, to enable him to fill in correctly that part of the\r\nlandscape concealed by the figure taken on the spot; so that, when\r\nreproduced by the photographer in _his_ studio, he will have a\r\nrepresentation of a natural scene, with everything seen in the\r\nbackground in correct perspective, and in natural proportions in\r\nrelation to the \"sitter.\" This will also show how _few_ objects can\r\nnaturally be introduced into a landscape background; and if the distant\r\nscenery be misty and undefined, so much the better. It is the sharpness,\r\nhardness, and superabundance of subjects introduced into pictorial\r\nbackgrounds generally that I object to, and endeavoured to point out in\r\nmy paper; and I consider it no small compliment to have had my views on\r\nthat part of my subject so emphatically endorsed by so good an authority\r\nas Mr. Wallis, in his remarks on backgrounds at the last meeting of the\r\nSouth London Photographic Society.\r\n\r\nI make no pretensions to the title of \"artist,\" although I studied\r\nperspective, drawing from the flat and round, light and shade, and other\r\nthings in connection with a branch of art which I abandoned many years\r\nago for the more lucrative profession of a photographer. Were I so\r\ndisposed, I could quote Reynolds, Burnett, and Ruskin as glibly as your\r\ncorrespondent; but I prefer putting my own views on any subject before\r\nmy readers in language of my own.\r\n\r\nI endeavour to be in all my words and actions thoroughly independent and\r\nconsistent, which is more than I can say for your correspondent \"A. H.\r\nW.\" In proof of which, I should like to call the attention of your\r\nreaders to a passage in his \"Practical Art Hints,\" in the last issue of\r\n_The British Journal of Photography_, where he says:--\"It is perversion\r\nand degradation to an art like ours to make its truth and unity\r\nsubservient to conventional tricks, shams, and mechanical dodges,\" while\r\nat the last meeting of the South London Photographic Society, when\r\nspeaking of backgrounds, he admitted they were _all conventional_.\r\n\r\nNow, that is just what we do not want, and which was the chief object I\r\nhad in view when I wrote my paper. We have had too many of those\r\nart-conventional backgrounds, and want something more in accordance with\r\nnatural truth and the requirements of photography.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to observe that I should be truly sorry were I\r\nto mislead anyone in the pursuit of knowledge relative to our\r\nprofession, either artistically or photographically. But let it be borne\r\nin mind that it is admitted on all sides, and by the best authorities,\r\nthat nearly all the pictorial backgrounds now in use are quite\r\nunnatural, and totally unsuited for the purposes for which they are\r\nintended. Therefore the paper I read will have done the good I intended,\r\nand answered the purpose for which it was written, if it has been the\r\nmeans of calling attention to such glaring defects and absurdities as\r\nare now being perpetrated by background painters, and bringing in their\r\nplace more natural, truthful, and photographically useful backgrounds\r\ninto the studios of all photographers.--I am, yours, &c.,\r\n\r\nJ. Werge.\r\n\r\n_February 10th, 1866._\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSPECTIVE IN BACKGROUNDS.\r\n\r\n_To the Editors._\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--I must beg of you to allow me to reply to Mr. Wall once\r\nmore, and for the last time, on this subject, especially as that\r\ngentleman expects an answer from me.\r\n\r\nTo put myself into a fair position with regard to Mr. Wall and your\r\nreaders, I will reply to the latter part of his letter first, by stating\r\nthat I endeavour to avoid all personality in this discussion, and should\r\nbe sorry to descend to anything of the kind knowingly. When I spoke of\r\n\"independency and consistency,\" I had not in view anything relative to\r\nhis private character, but simply that kind of independence which\r\nenables a man to trust to his own powers of utterance for the\r\nexpression of his ideas, instead of that incessant quoting the language\r\nof others, to which your correspondent, Mr. Wall, is so prone. As to his\r\ninconsistency, I mean that tendency which he exhibits to advocate a\r\nprinciple at one time, and denounce it at another. I shall prove that\r\npresently. Towards Mr. Wall, personally, I have neither animosity nor\r\npique, and would take him by the hand as freely and frankly as ever I\r\ndid were I to meet him at this moment. With his actions as a private\r\ngentleman I have nothing to do. I look upon him now as a controvertist\r\nonly. So far, I hope I have made myself clearly understood by Mr. Wall\r\nand all concerned.\r\n\r\nI also should like to have had so important a question discussed without\r\nintroducing so much of that frivolous smartness of style generally\r\nadopted by Mr. Wall. But, as he has introduced two would-be-funny\r\nsimiles, I beg to dispose of them before going into more serious matter.\r\nTaking the \"butcher\" first (see the fifth paragraph in Mr. Wall's last\r\nletter), I should say that, if I were _eating_ the meat, I should be\r\nable to judge of its quality, and know whether it was good or bad, in\r\nspite of all the butcher might say to the contrary; and surely, no man\r\nnot an out-and-out vegetarian, or lacking one of the five senses--to say\r\nnothing of _common sense_--will admit that it is _necessary_ to be a\r\n\"butcher\" to enable him to be a judge of good meat. On the same ground,\r\nI contend that it is _not_ necessary for a man to be an artist to have a\r\nthorough knowledge of perspective; and I have known many artists who\r\nknew as little about perspective, practically, as their easel did. They\r\nhad a vague and dreamy idea of some governing principles, but how to put\r\nthose principles into practice they had not the slightest notion. I once\r\nmet an artist who could not put a tesselated pavement into perspective,\r\nand yet he had some right to the title of artist, for he could draw and\r\npaint the human figure well. Perspective is based on geometrical\r\nprinciples, and can be as easily mastered by any man not an artist as\r\nthe first book of Euclid, or the first four rules of arithmetic; and,\r\nfor all that, it is astonishing how many artists know so little about\r\nthe working rules of perspective.\r\n\r\nAgain: Mr. Wall is surely not prepared to advance the dictum that no one\r\ncan know anything about art but a professional artist. If so, how does\r\nhe reconcile that opinion with the fact of his great and oft-quoted\r\nauthority, Ruskin, not being an artist, but simply, in his public\r\ncharacter, a voluminous writer on art, not always right, as many artists\r\nand photographers very well know.\r\n\r\nMr. Wall objects to my use of the word \"artist,\" but he seems to have\r\noverlooked the fact that I used the quotation marks to show that I meant\r\nto apply it to the class of self-styled artists, or men who arrogate to\r\nthemselves a title they do not merit--not such men as Landseer, Maclise,\r\nFaed, Philips, Millais, and others of, and not of, the \"Forty.\" Mr. Wall\r\nmay be an artist. I do not say he is not. He also is, or was, a painter\r\nof backgrounds. So he can apply to himself whichever title he likes\r\nbest; but whether he deserves either one or the other, depends on what\r\nhe has done to merit the appellative.\r\n\r\nMr. Wall questions the accuracy of the principles I advocated in my\r\npaper. I contend that I am perfectly correct, and am the more astonished\r\nat Mr. Wall when I refer to vol. v., page 123, of the _Photographic\r\nNews_. There I find, in an article bearing his own name, and entitled\r\n\"The Technology of Art as Applied to Photography,\" that he says:--\r\n\r\n\"If you make use of a painted cloth to represent an interior or out-door\r\nview, the horizontal line must be at somewhere about the height which\r\nyour lens is most generally placed at, and the vanishing point nearly\r\nopposite the spot occupied by the camera. * * * * I have just said that\r\nthe horizon of a landscape background and the vanishing point should be\r\nopposite the lens; I may, perhaps, for the sake of such operators as\r\nare not acquainted with perspective, explain why. The figure and the\r\nbackground are supposed to be taken at one and the same time, and the\r\ncamera has the place of the spectator by whom they are taken. Now,\r\nsuppose we have a real figure before a real landscape: if I look up at a\r\nfigure I obtain one view of it, but if I look down on it, I get another\r\nand quite a different view, and the horizon of the natural landscape\r\nbehind the figure is always exactly the height of _my_ eye. To prove\r\nthis, you may sit down before a window, and mark on the glass the height\r\nof the horizon; then rise, and, as you do so, you will find the horizon\r\nalso rises, and is again exactly opposite your eye. A picture, then, in\r\nwhich the horizontal line of the background represents the spectator as\r\nlooking up at the figure from a position near the base line, while the\r\nfigure itself indicates that the same spectator is at that identical\r\ntime standing with his eyes on a level with the figure's breast or\r\nchin--such productions are evidently false to art, and untrue to nature.\r\n* * * * The general fault in the painted screens we see behind\r\nphotographs arises from introducing too many objects.\"\r\n\r\nNow, as I advanced neither more nor less in my paper, why does Mr. Wall\r\nturn round and caution your readers not to receive such simple truths\r\nuttered by me? I was not aware that Mr. Wall had forestalled me in\r\nlaying down such rules; for at that date I was in America, and did not\r\nsee the _News_; but, on turning over the volume for 1861 the other day,\r\nsince this discussion began, I there saw and read, with surprise, the\r\nabove in his article on backgrounds. I am perfectly aware that I did not\r\nsay all that I might have said on perspective in my paper; but the\r\nlittle I did say was true in principle, and answered my purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wall (in the second paragraph of his last letter) speaks of the\r\n\"principal visual ray going from the point of distance to the point of\r\nsight, and forming a right angle to the perspective plane,\" it seems to\r\nme that he is not quite sure of the difference between the points of\r\n_sight_, _distance_, and _observation_, or of the relation and\r\napplication of one to the other. However, his coming articles on\r\nperspective will settle that. It also appears to me that he has\r\noverlooked the fact that my diagrams were _sections_, showing the\r\nperspective inclination and declination of the lines of a parallelogram\r\ntowards the point of sight. In my paper I said nothing about the _point\r\nof distance_; with that I had nothing to do, as it was not my purpose to\r\ngo into all the dry details of perspective. But I emphatically deny that\r\nanything like a \"bird's eye view\" of the figure could possibly be\r\nobtained by following any of the rules I laid down. In my paper I\r\ncontended for the camera being placed on a level with the head of the\r\nsitter, and that would bring the line of the horizon in a pictorial\r\nbackground also as high as the head of the sitter. And if the horizon of\r\nthe pictorial background were placed anywhere else, it would cause the\r\napparent overlapping of _two_ conditions of perspective in the resulting\r\nphotograph. These were the errors I endeavoured to point out. I maintain\r\nthat my views are perfectly correct, and can be proved by geometrical\r\ndemonstration, and the highest artistic and scientific testimony.\r\n\r\nI wish it to be clearly understood that I do not advocate the use of\r\npictorial backgrounds, and think I pretty strongly denounced them; but\r\nif they _must_ be used by photographers, either to please themselves or\r\ntheir customers, let them, for the credit of our profession, be as true\r\nto nature as possible.\r\n\r\nI think I have now answered all the points worth considering in Mr.\r\nWall's letter, and with this I beg to decline any further correspondence\r\non the subject.--I am, yours, &c.,\r\n\r\nJ. Werge.\r\n\r\n_March 5th, 1866._\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON PICTURES IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY.\r\n\r\nIn the following notes on some of the pictures in the National Gallery,\r\nit is not my intention to assume the character of an art-critic, but\r\nsimply to record the impressions produced on the mind of a photographer\r\nwhile looking at the works of the great old masters, with the view of\r\ncalling the attention of photographers and others interested in\r\nart-photography to a few of the pictures which exhibit, in a marked\r\ndegree, the relation of the horizon to the principal figures.\r\n\r\nDuring an examination of those grand old pictures, two questions\r\nnaturally arise in the mind: What is conventionality in art? and--In\r\nwhose works do we see it? The first question is easily answered by\r\nstating that it is a mode of treating pictorial subjects by established\r\nrule or custom, so as to obtain certain pictorial effects without taking\r\ninto consideration whether such effects can be produced by natural\r\ncombinations or not. In answer to the second question, it may be boldly\r\nstated that there is very little of it to be seen in the works of the\r\nbest masters; and one cannot help exclaiming, \"What close imitators of\r\nnature those grand old masters were!\" In their works we never see that\r\nphotographic eye-sore which may be called a binographic combination of\r\ntwo conditions of perspective, or the whereabouts of two horizons in the\r\nsame picture.\r\n\r\nThe old masters were evidently content with natural combinations and\r\neffects for their backgrounds, and relied on the rendering of natural\r\ntruths more than conventional falsehoods for the strength and beauty of\r\ntheir productions. Perhaps the simplest mode of illustrating this would\r\nbe to proceed to a kind of photographic analysis of the pictures of the\r\nold masters, and see how far the study of their works will enable the\r\nphotographer to determine what he should employ and what he should\r\nreject as pictorial backgrounds in the practice of photography. As a\r\nphotographer, then--for it is the photographic application of art we\r\nhave to consider--I will proceed to give my notes on pictures in the\r\nNational Gallery, showing the importance of having the horizontal line\r\nin its proper relation to the sitter or figure.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most beautiful example is the fine picture by Annibale\r\nCarracci of \"Christ appearing to Peter.\" This admirable work of art as\r\nnearly as possible contains the proportions of a carte-de-visite or\r\nwhole-plate picture enlarged, and is well worthy the careful attention\r\nand study of every photographer; not only for its proportions and the\r\namount of landscape background introduced, showing the proper position\r\nof the horizon and the small amount of sky visible, but it is a\r\nwonderful example of light and shade, foreshortening, variety and\r\ncontrast of expression, purity of colour, simplicity of design, and\r\ntruthfulness to nature. Neither of the figures lose any of their force\r\nor dignity, although the horizontal line is as high as their heads, and\r\nthe whole of the space between is filled in with the scene around them.\r\nIn its linear perspective it is quite in keeping with the figures, and\r\nthe scenery is in harmonious subjection, controlled and subdued by\r\naerial perspective.\r\n\r\nThe large picture of \"Erminia takes refuge with the Shepherds,\" by the\r\nsame artist, is also a fine example of a horizon high in the picture.\r\nThe figure of Erminia is separated from the other figures, and could be\r\ncopied or reproduced alone without any loss of beauty and dignity, or\r\nany violation of natural laws.\r\n\r\nMurillo's picture of \"St. John and the Lamb\" suggests an admirable\r\nbackground for the use of the photographer. It consists of dark masses\r\nof rock and foliage. Nothing distinct or painfully visible, the distant\r\nmasses of foliage blend with the clouds, and there is nothing in the\r\nbackground but masses of light and shade to support or relieve the\r\nprincipal objects.\r\n\r\nIn the picture of \"Christ appearing to Mary Magdalene,\" by Titian, the\r\nwater-line is above the head of Christ, but if the figure were standing\r\nupright, the head of the Saviour would break the horizontal line.\r\n\r\nTitian's \"Bacchus and Ariadne\" also has the water-line breast high,\r\nalmost to the neck of Ariadne. The figure of Bacchus springing from the\r\ncar, as a matter of course, is much higher in the sky. This picture\r\npresents the perspective conditions of the painter having been seated\r\nwhile painting such figures from nature, or similar to the results and\r\neffects obtained by taking a group with the lens on a level with the\r\nbreast or lower part of the necks of figures standing.\r\n\r\nIn Titian's portrait of Ariosto there is a dark foliated background\r\nwhich gives great brilliancy to the picture, but no sky is visible. The\r\n\"Portrait of a Lady,\" by Paris Bardone, has an architectural background\r\nin which no sky is to be seen. The picture is very brilliant, and the\r\nmonotony of a plain background is skilfully overcome.\r\n\r\nThe picture of \"St. Catharine of Alexandria,\" by Raphael, has a\r\nlandscape background, with the horizon about as high as the breast, as\r\nif the artist had been seated and the model standing during the process\r\nof painting.\r\n\r\nRaphael's picture of \"The Vision of a Knight\" is another example of the\r\nfearlessness of that artist in putting in or backing up his figures with\r\na large amount of landscape background.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of Correggio's \"Venus, Mercury, and Cupid,\" are as\r\nnearly as possible those of a carte-de-visite enlarged; and that picture\r\nhas no sky in the background, but a very suitable dark, cool, rocky\r\nscene, well subdued, for the rocks are quite near to the figures. This\r\nbackground gives wonderful brilliancy to the figures, and contrasts\r\nadmirably with the warm and delicate flesh tints.\r\n\r\nCorreggio's \"Holy Family\" has a landscape and architectural background,\r\nwith a very little sky visible in the right-hand corner.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Judgment of Paris,\" by Rubens, the horizontal line of the\r\nbackground cuts the waist of the first female figure, showing that the\r\nartist was seated. The other two female figures are placed against a\r\nbackground of rocks and dark masses of foliage. Rubens' picture of the\r\n\"Holy Family and St. George\" is also a good example of the kind of\r\npicture for the photographer to study as to the situation of the\r\nhorizontal line.\r\n\r\nThe picture of \"The Idle Servant,\" by Nicolaes Maes, is also an\r\nexcellent subject for study of this kind. It shows the due relation of\r\nthe horizon of an interior in a very marked degree, and its shape and\r\nsubject are very suitable to the size and form of a carte-de-visite. So\r\nare his pictures of \"The Cradle\" and \"A Dutch Housewife.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture of \"John Arnolfini of Lucca and his Wife,\" painted by John\r\nVan Eyck in the fifteenth century, is an excellent specimen of an\r\ninterior background, with a peep out of a window on one side of the\r\nroom. This is a capital subject for the study of photographers who wish\r\nto use a background representing an interior.\r\n\r\n\"The Holy Family at a Fountain,\" a picture of the Dutch school, painted\r\nby Schoorel in the sixteenth century, has an elaborate landscape\r\nbackground with the horizon above the heads of the figures, as if the\r\nartist had been standing and the models sitting.\r\n\r\nFor an example of a portrait less than half-length, with a landscape\r\nbackground, look at the portrait of \"An Italian Gentleman,\" by Andrea da\r\nSolario. This picture shows how very conscientiously the old masters\r\nworked up to the truth of nature in representing the right amount of\r\nlandscape in proportion to the figure; but the background is much too\r\nhard and carefully worked out to be pleasing. Besides, it is very\r\ndestructive to the force and power of the picture, which will be at once\r\nvisible on going to the portraits by Rembrandt, which have a marvellous\r\npower, and seem to stand right before the dark atmospheric backgrounds\r\nwhich that artist generally painted in his portraits.\r\n\r\nThere are other examples of half-length portraits with landscape\r\nbackgrounds, wherein the horizontal line passes right through the eyes\r\nof the principal figure, one of which I will mention. It is that of the\r\n\"Virgin and Child,\" by Lorenzo di Credi. In this picture the horizontal\r\nline passes right through the eyes of the Virgin without interfering\r\nwith the interest of the chief object.\r\n\r\nSeveral examples of an opposite character are to be seen in the National\r\nGallery, with the horizon of the landscape background much too low in\r\nthe picture. It is needless to call special attention to them. After\r\ncarefully examining the works already named, and comparing them with the\r\nnatural effects to be observed daily, it will be quickly seen which is a\r\ntruthful picture in this respect, and which is a false one.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHARPNESS AND SOFTNESS _V._ HARDNESS.\r\n\r\nThe discussion on \"Sharpness: what is it?\" at the meeting of the South\r\nLondon Photographic Society in May, 1861, and the more recent discussion\r\non \"Focussing\" at the last meeting of the same Society, seem to me to\r\nhave lost much of their value and importance to photographers for want\r\nof a better definition of the term _hardness_ as applied to art, and as\r\nused by _artists_ in an _artistic sense_. Webster, in his second\r\ndefinition of the word \"hardness,\" gives it as \"difficulty to be\r\nunderstood.\" In that sense Mr. Wall succeeded admirably when he gave\r\nthe term _concentration_, in reply to Mr. Hughes, who asked Mr. Wall\r\nwhat he meant by _hardness_. Fairholt gives the _art meaning_ of the\r\nword as \"want of refinement; academic drawing, rather than artistic\r\nfeeling.\" But even that definition would not have been sufficiently\r\ncomprehensive to convey an adequate idea of the meaning of the term in\r\ncontradistinction to the word _sharpness_, and I cannot but think that\r\nMr. Wall failed in his object in both papers, and lost considerable\r\nground in both discussions, by not giving more attention to the nice\r\ndistinctions of the two terms as used in art, and explaining their\r\nartistic meanings more clearly.\r\n\r\nSharpness need not be hardness; on the contrary, sharpness and softness\r\ncan be harmoniously combined in the representation of any object\r\ndesired. On the other hand, a subject may possess abundance of detail,\r\nand yet convey to the mind an idea of _hardness_ which the artist did\r\nnot intend. This kind of hardness I should attribute to a miscarriage of\r\nthought, or a failure, from want of manipulative skill, to produce the\r\ndesired effect. For example: one artist will paint a head, model it\r\ncarefully, and carry out all the gradations of light and shade, and for\r\nall that it will be _hard_--hard as stone, resembling the transcript of\r\na painted statue more than flesh. With the same brushes and colours\r\nanother artist will paint a head that may be no better in its drawing,\r\nnor any more correct in its light and shade, but it will resemble\r\n_flesh_, and convey to the mind of the observer a correct impression of\r\nthe substance represented--its flexibility and elasticity--that it is\r\nsomething that would be warm and pleasant to the touch, and not make you\r\nrecoil from it as if it were something cold, hard, and repulsive, as in\r\nthe former case. Again, two artists will paint a fabric or an article of\r\nfurniture (say a table) with the same brushes, pigments, and mediums:\r\nthe one artist will render it so faithfully in every respect that it\r\nwould suggest to the mind the dull sound peculiar to wood when struck,\r\nand not the sharp, clear ring of metal which the work of the other\r\nartist would suggest.\r\n\r\nAnother example: one artist paints a feather, and it appears to have all\r\nthe feathery lightness and characteristics of the natural object; the\r\nother will paint it the same size, form, and colour, and yet it will be\r\nmore like a painted chip, wanting the downy texture and float-in-the-air\r\nsuggestiveness of the other. Thus it will be seen that both artists had\r\nsimilar ideas, had similar materials and means at their disposal to\r\nrender on canvas the same or similar effects. The one succeeded, and the\r\nother failed, in giving a faithful rendering of the same subjects; but\r\nit was no fault in the materials with which they worked. The works of\r\none artist will convey to the mind an idea of the thing itself; with its\r\ntexture, properties, weight, and proportions; nothing undervalued;\r\nnothing overrated, nothing softer, nothing harder, than the thing in\r\nnature intended to be portrayed. The other gives the same idea of form\r\nand size, light and shade, and colour, but not the texture; it is\r\nsomething harder, as iron instead of wood, or hard wood instead of soft\r\nwood, or stone instead of flesh. This, then, is the artistic meaning of\r\nhardness (or concentration, as Mr. Wall said), and that is an apparent\r\npacking together, a compression or petrifaction of the atoms or fibre of\r\nwhich the natural materials are composed. This difference in the works\r\nof artists is simply the effects of _feeling_, of power over the\r\nmaterials employed, and ability to transfer to canvas effects that are\r\nalmost illusions. And so it is with photographers in the production of\r\nthe photographic image. There is the same difference in feeling and\r\nmanipulative skill, the same difference of power over the materials\r\nemployed, that enables one photographer to surpass another in rendering\r\nmore truthfully the difference of texture. Photographers may and do use\r\nthe same lenses and chemicals, and yet produce widely different results.\r\nOne, by judgment in lighting and superior manipulation, will transfer to\r\nhis plates more texture and suggestiveness of the different substances\r\nrepresented than the other. It is a fact well known to old photographers\r\nthat in the best days of the Daguerreotype practice two widely\r\ndifferent classes of pictures were produced by the most skilful\r\n_Daguerreotypists_, both sharp and full of exquisite detail; yet the one\r\nwas _hard_, in an artistic sense, not that it wanted half-tone to link\r\nthe lights and shades together, but because it was of a bronzy\r\nhardness, unlike flesh from which it was taken, and suggested to the\r\nmind a picture taken from a bronze or iron statue of the individual,\r\nrather than a picture taken from the warm, soft flesh of the original.\r\nThe other would be equally sharp as far as focussing and _sharp lenses_\r\ncould make it, and possess as much detail, but it would be different in\r\ncolour and texture; the detail would be soft, downy, and fleshy, not\r\nirony, if I may use that word in such a sense; and this difference of\r\neffect arose entirely from a difference of feeling, lighting,\r\npreparation of the plate, and development of the pictures. They might\r\nall use the best of Voightlander's or C. C. Harrison's lenses, the\r\nfavourite lenses of that day. They might all use the same make of\r\nplates, the same iodine, bromine, and mercury, yet there would be this\r\ndifference in the character of the two classes of pictures. Both would\r\nbe sharp and possess abundance of detail, still one would be _soft_ and\r\nthe other hard in an artistic acceptation of the word _hardness_.\r\n\r\nCollodion positives exhibited a similar difference of character. The\r\nworks of one photographer would be cold and metallic looking, while the\r\nworks of another would be softer and less metallic, giving a better idea\r\nof the texture of flesh and the difference of fabrics, which many\r\nattributed to the superiority of the lens; but the difference was really\r\ndue to manipulation, treatment, and intelligence. And so it is with the\r\ncollodion negative. A tree, for instance, may be photographed, and its\r\nwhole character changed by selecting a bad and unsuitable light, or by\r\nbad manipulation. The least over-development or \"piling up\" of a high\r\nlight may give it a sparkling effect that would change it into the\r\nrepresentation of a tree of cast iron, rather than a _growing tree_,\r\ncovered with damp, soft, and moss-stained bark. Every object and every\r\nfabric, natural or manufactured, has its own peculiar form of \"high\r\nlight\" or mode of reflecting light, and care must be taken by both\r\nartist and photographer not to exceed the amount of light reflected by\r\neach particular object, else a _hardness_, foreign to the natural\r\nobject, will be represented. But not only should the artist and\r\nphotographer possess this feeling for nature in all her subtle beauties\r\nand modes of expressing herself, to prevent a miscarriage in the true\r\nrendering of any object, the photographic printer should also have a\r\nsympathy for the work in hand, or he will, by over-fixing, or in various\r\nother ways, mar the successful labours of the photographer, and make a\r\nnegative that is full of softness, and tenderly expresses the truth of\r\nnature, yield prints that are crude, and convey to the mind a sense of\r\n_hardness_ which neither the natural objects nor the negative really\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nNow, I think it will be seen that _hardness_ in a painting or a\r\nphotograph does not mean sharpness; nor is the artistic meaning of the\r\nword _hardness_ confined to \"rigid or severe drawing,\" but that it has a\r\nbroader and more practical definition than concentration; and that the\r\nconverse to the art meaning of _hardness_ is softness, tenderness,\r\ntruthfulness in expressing the varied aspects of nature in all her\r\nforms, all of which are coincident with sharpness.--J. Werge\r\n(_Photographic News_).\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH LONDON PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\n_To the Editors, British Journal._\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--Allow me to express my opinion on the suggestion to unite\r\nthe North and South London Societies, and to point out a few of the\r\nadvantages which, I think, would accrue from a more extensive\r\namalgamation.\r\n\r\nThough I am a member of all the three London photographic societies, I\r\nhave long been of opinion that there are too many, and that the objects\r\nof all are considerably weakened by such a diffusion of interests. If\r\nthe furtherance of the art and the free and mutual interchange of\r\nthought and experience among the members were the only things\r\nconsidered, there would be but one society in London; and with one\r\nsociety embodying all the members that now make the three, how much more\r\ngood might be done!\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the amounts now paid for rent by the three would, if\r\nunited, secure an excellent meeting room or chambers, in a central\r\nposition, for the _exclusive_ use of the society, where the ordinary and\r\nspecial meetings, annual exhibitions, and _soirees_ could be held much\r\nmore independently than now, and at a cost little or no more than what\r\nis now paid for the privilege of holding the ordinary meetings alone.\r\n\r\nSecondly: If such a place of meeting were secured, then that laudable\r\nscheme of an art library, so strenuously advocated by Mr. Wall and Mr.\r\nBlanchard at the South London Photographic Society, might be\r\nsuccessfully carried into effect. Then a library and a collection of\r\nworks of art might be gradually gathered together, and one of the\r\nmembers could be chosen curator and librarian, to attend the rooms one\r\nevening in the week, or oftener, as circumstances might require, so as\r\nto give members access to the library to make exchanges, extracts from\r\nbulky books, &c.\r\n\r\nThirdly: If the union were effected, and the place of meeting more\r\ncentral, there would be a larger attendance of members, and more\r\nspirited and valuable proceedings would be the result. Papers to be read\r\nat the regular meetings would be much more certain, and the discussions\r\nwould be more comprehensive and complete. The members would become\r\npersonally acquainted with each other, and a much better feeling would\r\npervade the whole photographic community.\r\n\r\nThese, gentlemen, are a few of the advantages which ought to accrue from\r\na union of the three societies; but, if that cannot be effected, by all\r\nmeans let the triumvirate now existing be reduced to a biumvirate. If it\r\nbe not possible for the \"Parent Society\" and her offspring to reunite\r\ntheir interests and affection for the common good, surely the other two\r\ncan, and thereby strengthen themselves, and secure to their members a\r\nmoiety of the advantages which would result from the triple alliance.\r\n\r\nBut, before proceeding farther, let me ask--Has such a thing as a triple\r\nalliance ever been considered? Has it been ascertained that an amicable\r\namalgamation with the Photographic Society of London is impossible? If\r\nso, what are the motives of the proposers of the union of the North and\r\nSouth London Societies? Do they wish to form a more powerful antagonism\r\nto the other society, or do they simply and purely wish to further the\r\nadvancement of our art-science, and not to gratify personal pique or\r\nwounded pride? I do not wish to impute such unworthy motives to anyone;\r\nbut it does seem singular that the proposition should come from the\r\nChairman of the North London Photographic Association almost\r\nsimultaneously with the resignation of his seat at the council board of\r\nthe Parent Society.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the motives are pure, honest, and earnest, I heartily\r\napprove of the suggestion as a step in the right direction, although I\r\ncandidly admit that I would much rather see all the societies united in\r\none, and fully believe that that would be the most advantageous\r\narrangement that could possibly be made for all concerned.--I am,\r\nyours, &c.,\r\n\r\nUnion Jack (J. Werge).\r\n\r\n_London, February 18th, 1867._\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION OF THE LONDON PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\n_To the Editors of the British Journal._\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--Perhaps I am in courtesy bound to answer the questions of\r\nyour correspondents, Mr. Homersham and \"Blue Pendant,\" but in\r\nself-justification I do not think it necessary, for it turns out that my\r\nsuspicions of antagonism to the Parent Society were well founded; and,\r\nfrom their remarks, and the observations of your contributor \"D.,\" I\r\nlearn that the disaffection is more widely spread than I at first\r\nthought it was.\r\n\r\nI may have been wrong in suspecting the Chairman of the North London\r\nPhotographic Association of unworthy motives; if so, I frankly beg that\r\ngentleman's pardon. But I am not wrong in suspecting that antagonism is\r\nmixed up with the movement.\r\n\r\nYour contributor \"D.\" chooses to construe my unwillingness to make a\r\ndirect charge--my hope that there were no such unworthy motives--into\r\ntimidity; but I beg to remind \"D.\" that there is not much, if any, of\r\nthat apparent in my putting the plain questions I did, which,\r\nby-the-by, have not yet been very satisfactorily answered.\r\n\r\nI flatter myself that I know when and how to do battle, and when to sue\r\nfor peace, as well as any in the service under whose flag I have the\r\nhonour to sail; and I, as much as anyone, admire the man that can fight\r\ncourageously when in the right, or apologise gracefully when in the\r\nwrong; but, as the object of this correspondence is neither to make\r\nrecriminations, nor indulge in personal abuse, I return to the primary\r\nconsideration of the subject, and endeavour to sift the motives of the\r\nmovers of the proposition to unite the North and South London Societies,\r\nand ascertain, if possible, whether they have the good of those\r\nsocieties and the furtherance of photography really at heart or not.\r\n\r\n_Imprimis_, then, let us consider the arguments of \"D.,\" who cites the\r\nresignation of three gentlemen in proof of the management of the London\r\nPhotographic Society being \"out of joint.\" He might as well say,\r\n\"because a man is sick, leave him and let him die.\" If there were\r\nanything they disliked in the government of the Society, or any evil to\r\nbe corrected, their most manly course was to have held on, and fought\r\nthe evils down. They all had seats at the Council board, and if they had\r\nwished well to the Society, they would not have resigned them, but\r\nbattled for the right, and brought their grievances, real or imagined,\r\nbefore the members. A special meeting has been called before now to\r\nconsider personal grievances which affected the honour of the Society,\r\nand I should think it could have been done again. I do not maintain that\r\nall is right in the Society, but I do think that they were wrong in\r\nresigning their seats because an article appeared in the Society's\r\njournal condemnatory of a process to which they happened to be devotedly\r\nattached.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be supposed that the cause of reform, or the general\r\ngood of the country, would have been forwarded had Gladstone, Bright,\r\nand Earl Russell resigned their seats as members of either House because\r\nthey could not carry their ministerial bill of last session. From this I\r\nargue that men who have the object they advocate, and the \"best\r\ninterests\" of the Society, thoroughly at heart, will stick to it\r\ntenaciously, whether in or out of office, and, by their watchfulness,\r\nprevent bad becoming worse, in spite of captious opposition, fancied\r\ninsults, or journalistic abuse.\r\n\r\nThe next paragraph by \"D.\" on which I shall comment contains that bold\r\ninsinuation of timidity, which I have already noticed as much as I\r\nintend to do. But I wish to discuss the question of \"absorption\" a\r\nlittle more fully. I cannot at all agree with the sentiments of \"D.\" on\r\nthat subject. Absorption is in many instances a direct and positive\r\nadvantage to both the absorber and absorbed, as the absorption of Sicily\r\nby Italy, and Frankfort and Hanover by Prussia. Nitric acid absorbs\r\nsilver, and how much more valuable and useful to the photographer is the\r\nproduct than either of the two in their isolated condition; and so, I\r\nhold, it would be with the Society were the two other Societies to join\r\nthe old one, impart to it their chief characteristics, re-model the\r\nconstitution, and elect the members of the Council by ballot. We should\r\nthen have a society far more powerful and useful than could ever be\r\nobtained by the formation of a new one.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing, I think I have also answered the question of Mr.\r\nHomersham, as well as that part of \"Blue Pendant's\" letter relating to\r\nthe establishment of a _fourth_ society. On that point my views\r\nharmonise with those of your contributor, \"D.\"\r\n\r\nOn the subject of \"members of Council,\" I do not agree with either \"D.\"\r\nor your correspondent \"Blue Pendant.\" The Council should be elected from\r\nand by the body of members, and the only qualifications necessary should\r\nbe willingness and ability to do the work required. No consideration of\r\nclass should ever be admitted. The members are all recommended by\r\n\"personal knowledge,\" and elected by ballot, and that alone should be\r\ntest sufficient on the score of respectability.\r\n\r\nConcerning \"papers written as puffs,\" I cordially agree with \"Blue\r\nPendant\" as far as he goes; but I go further than that, and would insist\r\non each paper being scrutinised, before it is read, by a committee\r\nappointed for the purpose, so as to prevent \"trade advertisements\" and\r\nsuch shamefully scurrilous papers as I have heard at the South London\r\nPhotographic Society.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the questions put by \"Blue Pendant,\" I beg to decline\r\nanswering his second, it not being pertinent; but I shall reply to his\r\nfirst more particularly. He seems to have forgotten or overlooked the\r\nfact that I thought the advantages I enumerated would result from a\r\nunion of the _three_ societies--not from an alliance of the two only.\r\nThat I still look upon suspiciously as antagonistic to the Parent\r\nSociety; and \"Blue Pendant's\" antagonism is proved beyond doubt when he\r\nsays it is \"tottering to its fall,\" and he almost gloatingly looks\r\nforward to its dissolution coming, to use his own words, \"sooner or\r\nlater,\" and \"perhaps the sooner the better.\" But I venture to think that\r\n\"Blue Pendant\" is not likely to be gratified by seeing the \"aged Parent\"\r\ndecently laid in the ground in his time. There is too much \"life in the\r\nold dog yet\"--even since the secession--for that to come to pass. It\r\ncannot be denied that the Parent Society has amongst its members some\r\nof the best speakers, thinkers, writers, and workers in the whole\r\nphotographic community.\r\n\r\nWhile discussing this subject, allow me, gentlemen, to advert to an\r\narticle in your contemporary of Friday last. In the \"Echoes of the\r\nMonth,\" by an Old Photographer, the writer thinks that the advantages I\r\npointed out as likely to accrue from a union of the societies are a\r\n\"pleasant prospect that will not bear the test of figures.\" It is a fact\r\nthat \"figures\" are subject to the rules of addition as well as of\r\nsubtraction, and I wish to show by figures that my ideas are not so\r\nimpracticable as he imagines. In addition to the eight guineas a year\r\npaid by the North and South London Photographic Societies for rent, I\r\nnotice in the report of the London Photographic Society, published last\r\nmonth, two items in the \"liabilities\" which are worth considering. One\r\nis \"King's College, rent and refreshment, L42 4s. 6d.,\" which, I\r\npresume, is for one year. The other is \"King's College _soiree_ account,\r\nL20 15s. 6d.,\" part of which is undoubtedly for rent of rooms on that\r\noccasion. Now there is a clear showing of over L50 12s. 6d. paid in one\r\nyear by the three societies for rent and refreshment, the latter not\r\nbeing absolutely necessary. I may be mistaken in my estimate of the\r\nvalue of central property; but I do think a sum exceeding L50 is\r\nsufficient to secure a room or chambers large enough for the purposes of\r\nmeeting, and keeping a library, &c.; or, if not, would it not be worth\r\nwhile making a strain to pay a little more so as to secure the\r\naccommodation required? If the Coventry Street experiment were a failure\r\nfrom apathy or other causes, that is no proof that another attempt made\r\nby a more numerous, wealthy, and energetic body would also be abortive.\r\nIn sea phraseology, \"the old ship has made a long leg to-day!\" but I\r\nhope, gentlemen, you will not grudge the space required for the full and\r\ncareful consideration of this subject. The \"developing dish\" and the\r\nordinary _modus operandi_ of photography can well afford to stand aside\r\nfor awhile to have this question discussed to the end. I have not said\r\nall I can on the amalgamation project, and may return to it again with\r\nyour kind permission, if necessary.--I am, yours, &c.,\r\n\r\nUnion Jack (J. Werge).\r\n\r\n_London, March 4, 1867._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIETY'S EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\nImpressions and Convictions of \"Lux Graphicus.\"\r\n\r\nThe brief and all but impromptu Exhibition of the Photographic Society,\r\nrecently held in the rooms of the Architectural Society, 9, Conduit\r\nStreet, Regent Street, where the Society's meetings are to be held in\r\nfuture, was one of the pleasantest and most useful expositions in\r\nconnection with photography that has been consummated for many years. In\r\nthe first place the idea of an exhibition evening free from the\r\nformalities of a _soiree_ was a happy one; the _locale_ was happily\r\nchosen; and the whole arrangements most happily successful. Everybody\r\nseemed to be pleased; cordial expressions of agreeable surprise were\r\nfreely exchanged; and there were abundance and variety enough of\r\npictorial display to satisfy the most fastidious visitor.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the works of M. Salomon, exhibited by\r\nMr. Wharton Simpson, were the chief objects of attraction, and\r\nduring the whole of the evening an anxious group surrounded the\r\ncollection; and it was curious to remark with what eagerness these\r\npictures were scrutinized, so as to ascertain whether they were\r\nexamples of photography \"pure and undefiled,\" or helped by artistic\r\nlabour afterwards. That they are the very finest specimens of\r\nart-photography--both in the broad and masterly treatment of light and\r\nshade, pose, manipulation, tone of print, and after finish--that have\r\never been exhibited, is unquestionable; but to suppose that they are\r\nphotographs unaided by art-labour afterwards is, I think, a mistake. All\r\nof the heads, hands, and portions of the drapery bear unmistakable\r\nproofs of after-touching. Some of them give evidence of most elaborate\r\nretouching on the hands and faces, on the surface of the print. I\r\nexamined the pictures by daylight most minutely with the aid of a\r\nmagnifying glass, and could detect the difference between the retouching\r\non the negative, and, after printing, on the positive. The faces of\r\nnearly all the ladies present that appearance of dapple or \"stipple\"\r\nwhich nothing in the texture of natural flesh can give, unless the\r\nsitter were in the condition of \"goose flesh\" at the moment of sitting,\r\nwhich is a condition of things not at all likely. Again, hatching is\r\ndistinctly visible, which is not the photographic reproduction of the\r\nhatch-like line of the cuticle. In support of that I have two forms of\r\nevidence: first, _comparison_, as the hatchings visible on the surface\r\nof the print are too long to be a reproduction of the hatch-like\r\nmarkings of the skin, even on the hands, which generally show that kind\r\nof nature's handiwork the most. Besides, the immense reduction would\r\nrender that invisible even under a magnifying glass, no matter how\r\ndelicate the deposit of silver might be on the negative; or even if it\r\nwere so, the fibre of the paper would destroy the effect. Again, the\r\nhatchings visible are not the form of nature's hatchings, but all\r\npartake of that art-technical form called \"sectional hatchings.\" I could\r\nname several of the prints that showed most conclusive evidence of what\r\nI say, but that is not necessary, because others saw these effects as\r\nwell as I did. But I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have not\r\nbeen at the pains to make these examinations and observations with the\r\nview of lessening the artistic merit of these pictures. I unhesitatingly\r\npronounce them the most beautiful achievements of the camera that have\r\never been obtained by combining artistic knowledge and skill with the\r\nmechanical aid of the camera and ability to handle the compounds of\r\nphotographic chemistry. There is unmistakable evidence of the keenest\r\nappreciation of art, and all that is beautiful in it in the production\r\nof the negative; and if the artist see or think that he can perfect his\r\nwork by the aid of the brush, he has a most undoubted right to do it.\r\nThis question of pure and simple photography has been mooted all the\r\nsummer, ever since the opening of the French Exhibition, and I am glad\r\nthat I, as well as others, have had an opportunity of seeing these\r\nwonderful pictures, and judging for myself. Photography is truth\r\nembodied, and every question raised about the purity of its productions\r\nshould be discussed as freely and settled as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThere was another picture in the exhibition very clever in its\r\nconception, but not so in its execution, and I am sorry to say I cannot\r\nendorse _all_ the good that has been said of it. I allude to Mr.\r\nRobinson's picture of \"Sleep.\" How that clever photographer, with such a\r\nkeen eye to nature as he generally manifests in his composition\r\npictures, should have committed such a mistake I am at a loss to know.\r\nHis picture of \"Sleep\" is so strangely untrue to nature, that he must\r\nhave been quite overcome by the \"sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve\r\nof _care_\" when he composed it. In the centre of the picture he shows a\r\nstream of light entering a window--a ghost of a window, for it is so\r\nunsubstantial as not to allow a shadow to be cast from its _seemingly_\r\nmassive bars. Now, if the moon shone through a window at all, it would\r\ncast shadows of everything that stood before it, and the shadows of the\r\nbars of the window would be cast upon the coverlet of the bed in broken\r\nlines, rising and falling with the undulations of the folds of the\r\ncovering, and the forms of the figures of the children. In representing\r\nmoonlight, or sunlight either, there is no departing from this truth. If\r\nthe direct ray of either stream through a closed window and fall upon\r\nthe bed, so will the shadows of the intervening bars. Any picture,\r\neither painted or photographed, that does not render those shadows is\r\nsimply untrue to nature; and if the difficulty could not have been\r\novercome, the attempt should have been abandoned. Then the beams are not\r\nsharp enough for moonlight, and the shadows on the coverlet and children\r\nare not deep enough, and the reflections on the shadow side of the\r\nchildren's faces are much too strong. In short, I do not know when Mr.\r\nRobinson more signally failed to carry out his first intentions. Wanting\r\nin truth as the composition is, it proves another truth, and that is,\r\nthe utter inability of photography to cope with such a subject. Mr.\r\nRobinson exhibited other pictures that would bear a very different kind\r\nof criticism; but as they have been noticed at other times I shall not\r\ntouch upon them here.\r\n\r\nHerr Milster's picture bears the stamp of truth upon it, and is a\r\nbeautiful little gem, convincing enough that the effect is perfectly\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\nMr. Ayling's pictures of the Victoria Tower and a portion of Westminster\r\nAbbey are really wonderful, and the bit of aerial perspective \"Across\r\nthe Water\" in the former picture is truly beautiful.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cameron persists in sticking to the out-of-the-way path she has\r\nchosen, but where it will lead her to at last is very difficult to\r\ndetermine. One of the heads of Henry Taylor which she exhibited was\r\nundoubtedly the best of her contributions.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of yachts and interiors exhibited by Mr. Jabez Hughes were\r\nquite equal to all that could be expected from the camera of that\r\nclever, earnest, and indefatigable photographer. The portrait\r\nenlargements exhibited by that gentleman were exquisite, and of a\r\ntotally different character from any other exhibitor's.\r\n\r\nMr. England's dry plate pictures, by his modified albumen process, are\r\nundoubtedly the best of the kind that have been taken. They lack that\r\nappearance of the representation of _petrified_ scenes that most, if\r\nnot all, previous dry processes exhibited, and look as \"juicy\" as \"humid\r\nnature\" can well be rendered with the wet process.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Howard exhibited four little gems that would be perfect but\r\nfor the unnatural effect of the artificial skies he has introduced. The\r\n\"Stranded Vessels\" is nicely chosen, and one of the wood scenes is like\r\na bit of Creswick uncoloured.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Locke and Whitfield exhibited some very finely and sketchily\r\ncoloured photographs, quite up to their usual standard of artistic\r\nexcellence, with the new feature of being painted on a ground of carbon\r\nprinted from the negative by the patent carbon process of Mr. J. W.\r\nSwan.\r\n\r\nMr. Adolphus Wing's cabinet pictures were very excellent specimens, and\r\nI think it a great pity that more of that very admirable style of\r\nportraiture was not exhibited.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Dixon's copy of Landseer's dog \"Pixie,\" from the original\r\npainting, was very carefully and beautifully rendered.\r\n\r\nMr. Faulkner's portraits, though of a very different character, were\r\nquite equal in artistic excellence to M. Salomon's.\r\n\r\nMr. Bedford's landscapes presented their usual charm, and the tone of\r\nhis prints seemed to surpass the general beauty of his every-day work.\r\n\r\nMr. Blanchard also exhibited some excellent landscapes, and displayed\r\nhis usual happy choice of subject and point of sight.\r\n\r\nAn immense number of photographs by amateurs, Mr. Brownrigg, Mr.\r\nBeasley, and others, were exhibited in folios and distributed about the\r\nwalls, but it is impossible for me to describe or criticise more.\r\n\r\nI have already drawn my yarn a good length, and shall conclude by\r\nrepeating what I said at starting, that a pleasanter evening, or more\r\nuseful and instructive exhibition, has never been got up by the\r\nPhotographic Society of London, and it is to be hoped that the success\r\nand _eclat_ attending it will encourage them to go and do likewise next\r\nyear, and every succeeding one of its natural life, which I doubt not\r\nwill be long and prosperous, for the exhibition just closed has given\r\nunmistakable evidence of there being \"life in the old dog yet.\"\r\n\r\n_Photographic News, Nov. 22nd, 1867._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF CLOUDS IN LANDSCAPES.\r\n\r\nThe subject of printing skies and cloud effects from separate negatives\r\nhaving been again revived by the reading of papers on that subject at\r\nthe South London Photographic Society, I think it will not be out of\r\nplace now to call attention to some points that have not been commented\r\nupon--or, at any rate, very imperfectly--by either the readers of the\r\npapers or by the speakers at the meetings, when the subject was under\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of clouds in a landscape by an artist is not so much to\r\nfill up the blank space above the object represented on the lower part\r\nof the canvas or paper, as to assist in the composition of the picture,\r\nboth as regards linear and aerial perspective, and in the arrangement of\r\nlight and shade, so as to secure a just balance and harmony of the\r\nwhole, according to artistic principles.\r\n\r\nClouds are sometimes employed to repeat certain lines in the landscape\r\ncomposition, so as to increase their strength and beauty, and to unite\r\nthe terrestrial part of the picture with the celestial. At other times\r\nthey are used to balance a composition, both in form and effect, to\r\nprevent the picture being divided into two distinct and diagonal\r\nportions, as evidenced in many of the pictures by Cuyp; on other\r\noccasions they are introduced solely for chiaroscuro effects, so as to\r\nenable the artist to place masses of dark upon light, and _vice versa_.\r\nOf that use I think the works of Turner will afford the most familiar\r\nand beautiful examples.\r\n\r\nIn the instances cited, I make no allusion to the employment of clouds\r\nas repeaters of colour, but merely confine my remarks to their use in\r\nassisting to carry out form and effect, either in linear composition, or\r\nin the arrangement of light and shade in simple monochrome, as evidenced\r\nin the engraved translations of the works of Rembrandt, Turner, Birket\r\nFoster, and others, the study of those works being most applicable to\r\nthe practice of photography, and, therefore, offering the most valuable\r\nhints to both amateur and professional photographers in the management\r\nof their skies.\r\n\r\nBefore pursuing this part of my subject further, it may be as well,\r\nperhaps, to state my general opinions of the effects of so-called\r\n\"natural skies,\" obtained by one exposure and one printing. Admitting\r\nthat they are a vast improvement on the white-sky style of the early\r\nages of photography, they fall far short of what they should be in\r\nartistic effect and arrangement. In nearly all the \"natural skies\" that\r\nI have seen, their office appears to be no other than to use up the\r\nwhite paper above the terrestrial portion of the picture. The masses of\r\nclouds, if there, seem always in the wrong place, and never made use of\r\nfor breadth of chiaroscuro.\r\n\r\nNo better illustrations of this can be adduced than those large\r\nphotographs of Swiss and Alpine scenery by Braun of Dornach, which\r\nnearly all contain \"natural clouds;\" but, on looking them over, it will\r\nbe seen that few (if any) really exhibit that artistic use of clouds in\r\nthe composition of the pictures which evidence artistic knowledge. The\r\nclouds are taken just as they happen to be, without reference to their\r\nemployment to enhance the effects of any of the objects in the lower\r\nportion of the view, or as aids to the composition and general effect.\r\nFor the most part, the clouds are small and spotty, ill-assorting with\r\nthe grandeur of the landscapes, and never assisting the chiaroscuro in\r\nan artistic sense. The most noticeable example of the latter defect may\r\nbe seen in the picture entitled \"Le Mont Pilate,\" wherein a bald and\r\nalmost white mountain is placed against a light sky, much to the injury\r\nof its form, effect, and grandeur; indeed, the mountain is barely saved\r\nfrom being lost in the sky, although it is the principal object in the\r\npicture. Had an artist attempted to paint such a subject, he would have\r\nrelieved such a large mass of light against a dark cloud. An example of\r\na different character is observable in another photograph, wherein a\r\ndark conical mount would have been much more artistically rendered had\r\nit been placed against a large mass of light clouds. There are two or\r\nthree fleecy white clouds about the summit of the mountain, but, as far\r\nas pictorial effect goes, they would have been better away, for the mind\r\nis left in doubt whether they are really clouds, or the sulphurous puffs\r\nthat float about the crater of a slumbering volcano. That photographs\r\npossessing all the effects required by the rules of art are difficult,\r\nand almost impossible to obtain at one exposure in the camera, I readily\r\nallow. I know full well that a man might wait for days and weeks before\r\nthe clouds would arrange themselves so as to relieve his principal\r\nobject most advantageously; and, even if the desirable effects of light\r\nand shade were obtained, the chances are that the forms would not\r\nharmonize with the leading lines of the landscape.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, then, it must be self-evident that the best mode of\r\nprocedure will be to _print in skies_ from separate negatives, either\r\ntaken from nature or from drawings made for the purpose by an artist\r\nthat thoroughly understands art in all its principles. By these means,\r\nespecially the latter, skies may be introduced into the photographic\r\npicture that will not only be adapted to each individual scene, but\r\nwill, in every instance where they are employed, increase the artistic\r\nmerit and value of the composition. But to return to the subject chiefly\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\nClouds in landscape pictures, like \"man in his time,\" play many\r\nparts--\"they have their exits and their entrances.\" And it is almost\r\nimpossible to say enough in a short paper on a subject so important to\r\nall landscape photographers. I will, however, as briefly and lucidly as\r\nI can, endeavour to point out the chief uses of clouds in landscapes.\r\nReferring to their use for effects in light and shade, I wrote, at the\r\ncommencement of this paper, that the engraved translations of Turner\r\nafford the most familiar and beautiful examples, which they undoubtedly\r\ndo. But when I consider that Turner's skies are nearly all sunsets, the\r\nstudy of them will not be so readily turned to practical account by the\r\nphotographer as the works of others,--Birket Foster, for instance. His\r\nworks are almost equal to Turner's in light and shade; he has been\r\nlargely employed in the illustration of books, and five shillings will\r\nprocure more of his beautiful examples of sky effects than a guinea will\r\nof Turner's. Take, for example, Sampson Low and Son's five shilling\r\nedition of Bloomfield's \"Farmer's Boy,\" or Gray's \"Elegy in a\r\nChurchyard,\" profusely illustrated almost entirely by Birket Foster; and\r\nin them will be seen such a varied and marvellous collection of\r\nbeautiful sky effects as seem almost impossible to be the work of one\r\nman, and all of them profitable studies for both artist and photographer\r\nin the varied uses made of clouds in landscapes. In those works it will\r\nbe observed that where the lower part of the picture is rich in variety\r\nof subject the sky is either quiet or void of form, partaking of one\r\ntint only slightly broken up. Where the terrestrial part of the\r\ncomposition is tame, flat, and destitute of beautiful objects, the sky\r\nis full of beauty and grandeur, rich in form and masses of light and\r\nshade, and generally shedding a light on the insignificant object below,\r\nso as to invest it with interest in the picture, and connect it with the\r\nstory being told.\r\n\r\nFrom both of these examples the photographer may obtain a suggestion,\r\nand slightly tint the sky of his picture, rich in objects of interest,\r\nso as to resemble the tint produced by the \"ruled lines\" representing a\r\nclear blue sky in an engraving. Hitherto that kind of tinting has\r\ngenerally been overdone, giving it more the appearance of a heavy fog\r\nlifting than a calm blue sky. The darkest part of the tint should just\r\nbe a little lower than the highest light on the principal object. This\r\ntint may either be obtained in the negative itself at the time of\r\nexposure, or produced by \"masking\" during the process of printing. On\r\nthe other hand, when the subject has little to recommend it in itself,\r\nit may be greatly increased in pictorial power and interest by a\r\njudicious introduction of beautiful cloud effects, either obtained from\r\nnature, or furnished by the skill of an artist. If the aid of an artist\r\nbe resorted to, I would not recommend painting on the negative, but let\r\nthe artist be furnished with a plain white-sky print; let him wash in a\r\nsky, in sepia or india ink, that will most harmonise, both in form and\r\neffect, with the subject represented, take a negative from that sky\r\nalone, and put it into each of the pictures by double printing. This may\r\nseem a great deal of trouble and expense, and not appear to the minds of\r\nsome as altogether legitimate, but I strenuously maintain that any means\r\nemployed to increase the artistic merit and value of a photograph is\r\nstrictly legitimate; and that wherever and however art can be resorted\r\nto, without doing violence to the truthfulness of nature, the status of\r\nour art-science will be elevated, and its professional disciples will\r\ncease to be the scorn of men who take pleasure in deriding the,\r\nsometimes--may I say too often?--lame and inartistic productions of the\r\ncamera.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF CLOUDS AS BACKGROUNDS IN PORTRAITURE.\r\n\r\nThere has long been in the world an aphorism that everything in Nature\r\nis beautiful. Collectively this is true, and so it is individually, so\r\nfar as the adaptability and fitness of the object to its proper use are\r\nconcerned; but there are many things which are truly beautiful in\r\nthemselves, and in their natural uses, which cease to be so when they\r\nare pressed into services for which they are not intended by the great\r\nCreator of the universe. For example, what can be more beautiful than\r\nthat compound modification of cloud forms commonly called a \"mackerel\r\nsky,\" which is sometimes seen on a summer evening? What can be more\r\nlovely, or more admirably adapted to the purposes of reflecting and\r\nconducting the last flickering rays of the setting sun into the very\r\nzenith, filling half the visible heavens with a fretwork of gorgeous\r\ncrimson, reflecting a warm, mysterious light on everything below, and\r\nfilling the mind with wonder and admiration at the marvellous beauties\r\nwhich the heavens are showing? Yet, can anything be more unsuitable for\r\nforming the background to a portrait, where everything should be\r\nsubdued, secondary, and subservient to the features of the individual\r\nrepresented--where everything should be lower in tone than the light on\r\nthe face, where neither colour nor light should be introduced that would\r\ntend to distract the attention of the observer--where neither accessory\r\nnor effect should appear that does not help to concentrate the mind on\r\nthe grand object of the picture--the likeness? Still, how often do we\r\nsee a photographic portrait stuck against a sky as spotty, flickering,\r\nand unsuitable as the one just described! How seriously are the\r\nimportance and brilliancy of the head interfered with by the\r\nintroduction of such an unsuitable background! How often is the interest\r\nof the spectator divided between the portrait and the \"overdone\" sky, so\r\nelaborately got up by the injudicious background painter! Such\r\nbackgrounds are all out of place, and ought to be abandoned--expelled\r\nfrom every studio.\r\n\r\nAs the photographer does not possess the advantages of the painter, to\r\nproduce his effects by contrast of colour, it behoves him to be much\r\nmore particular in his treatment of light and shade; but most\r\nparticularly in his choice of a background that will most harmonise\r\nwith the dress, spirit, style, and condition in life of his sitter. It\r\nis always possible for a member of any class of the community to be\r\nsurrounded or relieved by a plain, quiet background; but it is not\r\npossible, in nine cases out of ten, for some individuals who sit for\r\ntheir portraits ever to be dwellers in marble halls, loungers in the\r\nmost gorgeous conservatories, or strollers in such delightful gardens.\r\nIn addition to the unfitness of such scenes to the character and\r\nevery-day life of the sitter, they are the most unsuitable for pictorial\r\neffect that can possibly be employed. For, instead of directing\r\nattention to the principal object, they disturb the mind, and set it\r\nwandering all over the picture, and interfere most seriously with that\r\nquiet contemplation of the features which is so necessary to enable the\r\nbeholder to discover all the characteristic points in the portrait. When\r\nthe likeness is a very bad one, this may be advantageous, on the\r\nprinciple of putting an ornamental border round a bad picture with the\r\nview of distracting the attention of the observer, and preventing the\r\neye from resting long enough on any one spot to discover the defects.\r\n\r\nWhen clouds are introduced as backgrounds to portraits, they should not\r\nbe of that small, flickering character previously alluded to, but broad,\r\ndark, and \"massy,\" so as to impart by contrast more strength of light to\r\nthe head; and the lighter parts of the clouds should be judiciously\r\nplaced either above or below the head, so as to carry the light into\r\nother parts of the picture, and prevent the strongly-lighted head\r\nappearing a spot. The best examples of that character will be found in\r\nthe engraved portraits by Reynolds, Lawrence, Gainsborough, and others,\r\nmany of which are easily obtained at the old print shops; some have\r\nappeared in the _Art Journal_.\r\n\r\nAs guides for introducing cloud effects, accessories, and landscape bits\r\ninto the backgrounds of carte-de-visite and cabinet pictures, no better\r\nexamples can be cited than those exquisite little figure subjects by R.\r\nWestall, R.A., illustrating Sharpe's Editions of the Old Poets. The\r\nengravings are about the size of cartes-de-visite, and are in themselves\r\nbeautiful examples of composition, light, and shade, and appropriateness\r\nof accessory to the condition and situation of the figures, affording\r\ninvaluable suggestions to the photographer in the arrangement of his\r\nsitter, or groups, and in the choice of suitable accessories and\r\nbackgrounds. Such examples are easily obtained. Almost any old bookstall\r\nin London possesses one or more of those works, and each little volume\r\ncontains at least half-a-dozen of these exquisite little gems of art.\r\n\r\nLooking at those beautiful photographic cartes-de-visite by Mr. Edge, I\r\nam very strongly impressed with the idea that they were suggested by\r\nsome such artistic little pictures as Westall's Illustrations of the\r\nPoets. They are really charming little photographs, and show most\r\nadmirably how much the interest and artistic merit of a photograph can\r\nbe enhanced by the skilful and judicious introduction of a suitable\r\nbackground. I may as well observe, _en passant_, that I have examined\r\nthese pictures very carefully, and have come to the conclusion that the\r\neffects are not produced by means of any of the ingeniously contrived\r\nappliances for poly-printing recently invented and suggested, but that\r\nthe effects are produced simply by double printing, manipulated with\r\nconsummate care and judgment, the figure or figures being produced on a\r\nplain or graduated middle tint background in one negative, and the\r\nlandscape effect printed on from another negative after the first print\r\nhas been taken out of the printing-frame; the figures protected by a\r\nmask nicely adjusted. My impressions on this subject are strengthened\r\nalmost to conviction when I look at one of Mr. Edge's photographs, in\r\nparticular a group of two ladies, the sitting figure sketching. In this\r\npicture, the lower part of the added landscape--trees--being darker than\r\nthe normal tint of the ground, shows a _line_ round the black dress of\r\nthe lady, as if the mask had overlapped it just a hair's breadth during\r\nthe process of secondary printing. Be that as it may, they are lovely\r\nlittle pictures, and afford ample evidence of what may be done by skill\r\nand taste to vary the modes of treating photography more artistically,\r\nby introducing natural scenery sufficiently subdued to harmonise with\r\nthe portrait or group; and, by similar means, backgrounds of clouds and\r\ninteriors may be added to a plain photograph, which would enrich its\r\npictorial effect, and enable the photographer to impart to his work a\r\ngreater interest and beauty, and, at the same time, be made the means of\r\ngiving apparent occupation to his sitter. This mode of treatment would\r\nenable him, in a great measure, to carry out the practice of nearly all\r\nthe most celebrated portrait painters, viz., that of considering the\r\nform, light, shade, and character of the background _after_ the portrait\r\nwas finished, by adapting the light, shade, and composition of his\r\nbackground to the pose and condition of life of his sitter.\r\n\r\nI shall now conclude my remarks with a quotation from Du Fresnoy's \"Art\r\nof Painting,\" bearing directly on my subject and that of light and\r\nshade:--\r\n\r\n   \"Permit not two conspicuous lights to shine\r\n    With rival radiance in the same design;\r\n    But yield to one alone the power to blaze,\r\n    And spread th' extensive vigour of its rays;\r\n    There where the noblest figures are displayed,\r\n    Thence gild the distant parts and lessening fade;\r\n    As fade the beams which Phoebus from the east\r\n    Flings vivid forth to light the distant West,\r\n    Gradual those vivid beams forget to shine,\r\n    So gradual let thy pictured lights decline.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"LUX GRAPHICUS\" ON THE WING.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Editor,--I have often troubled you with some of my ideas and\r\nopinions concerning the progress and status of photography, and you have\r\npretty often transferred the same to the columns of the _Photographic\r\nNews_, and troubled your readers in much the same manner. This time,\r\nhowever, I am going to tell you a secret--a family secret. They are\r\nalways more curious, interesting, and important than other secrets,\r\nstate secrets and Mr. McLachlan's photographic secret not excepted. But\r\nto my subject: \"_The_ Secret.\" Well, dear Mr. Editor, you know that my\r\nvocations have been rather arduous for some time past, and I feel that a\r\nlittle relaxation from pressing cares and anxieties would be a great\r\nboon to me. You know, also, that I am a great lover of nature, almost a\r\nstickler for it, to the exclusion of _prejudicial art_. And now that the\r\nspring has come and winter has fled on the wings of the fieldfares and\r\nwoodcocks--that's Thomas Hood's sentiment made seasonable--I fain would\r\nleave the pent-up city, where the colour of the sky can seldom be seen\r\nfor the veil of yellow smoke which so constantly obscures it, and betake\r\nmyself to the country, and inhale the fresh breezes of early spring;\r\ngladden my heart and eyes with a sight of the bright blue sky, the\r\nglistening snowdrops and glowing yellow crocuses, and regale my ears and\r\nsoul with the rich notes of the thrush and blackbird, and the earliest\r\nsong of the lark at the gates of heaven.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasant thing to be able to shake off the mud and gloom of a\r\nwinter's sojourn in a town, in the bright, fresh fields of the country,\r\nand bathe your fevered and enfeebled body in the cool airs of spring, as\r\nthey come gushing down from the hills, or across the rippling lake, or\r\ndancing sea. I always had such a keen relish for the country at all\r\nseasons of the year, it is often a matter of wonder to me that I ever\r\ncould bring my mind to the necessity of living in a town. But bread and\r\nbutter do not grow in hedgerows, though \"bread and cheese\" do; still the\r\nlatter will not support animal life of a higher order than grub or\r\ncaterpillars. \"There's the rub.\" The mind is, after all, the slave of\r\nthe body, for the mind must bend to the requirements of the body; and,\r\nas a man cannot live by gazing at a \"colt's foot,\" and if he have no\r\nappetite for horseflesh, he is obliged to succumb to his fate, and abide\r\nin a dingy, foggy, slushy, and bewildering world of mud, bricks, and\r\nmortar, instead of revelling in the bright fields, fresh air, and\r\ngushing melodies which God created for man, and gave man senses to enjoy\r\nhis glorious works.\r\n\r\nBut, Mr. Editor, I am mentally wandering among \"cowslips,\" daises,\r\nbuttercups, and wild strawberry blossoms, and forgetting the stern\r\nnecessity of confining my observations to a subject coming reasonably\r\nwithin the range of a class journal which you so ably conduct; but it is\r\npardonable and advantageous to allow mind to run before matter\r\nsometimes, for the latter is more frequently inert than the former, and\r\nwhen the mind has gone _ahead_, the body is sure to follow. Melancholy\r\ninstances of that present themselves to our notice too frequently. For\r\nexample, when a poor lady's or gentleman's wits are gone, _lettres des\r\ncachets_, and some kind or _un_kind friends, send the witless body to\r\nsome retreat where the wits of all the inmates are gone. I must,\r\nhowever, in all sober earnestness, return to my subject, or I fear you\r\nwill say: \"He is going to Hanwell.\" Well, perhaps I am, for I know that\r\nphotography is practised at that admirable institution; and now that I\r\nhave struck a professional chord, I may as well play on it.\r\n\r\nLenses and cameras, like birds and flowers, reappear in spring, and, as\r\nthe season advances and the sun attains a higher altitude, amateurs and\r\nprofessionals are quickened into a surprising activity. Renewed life is\r\nimparted to them, and the gregarious habits of man are developed in\r\nanother form, and somewhat in the manner that the swallows return to\r\ntheir old haunts. At first, a solitary scout or reconnoitering party\r\nmakes his appearance, then another, and another, until a complete flock\r\nof amateur and professional photographers are abroad, seeking what food\r\nthey can devour: some preferring the first green \"bits of foliage\" that\r\nbegin to gem the woods with emeralds, others waiting till the leaf is\r\nfully out, and the trees are thickly clothed in their early summer\r\nloveliness: while others prefer a more advanced state of beauty, and\r\nlike to depict nature in her russet hues, when the trees \"are in their\r\nyellow leaf.\" Some are contented with the old-fashioned homesteads and\r\nsweet green lanes of England for their subjects; others prefer the\r\nruined abbeys and castles of the feudal ages, with their deeply\r\ninteresting associations; others choose the more mythical monuments of\r\nsuperstition and the dark ages, such as King Arthur's round tables,\r\ndruidical circles, and remains of their rude temples of stone. Some\r\ndelight in pictorializing the lakes and mountains of the north, while\r\nothers are not satisfied with anything short of the sublime beauty and\r\nterrific grandeur of the Alps and Pyrenees. Truly, sir, I think it may\r\nbe safely stated that photographers are lovers of nature, and, I think,\r\nthey are also lovers of art. If some of them do not possess that art\r\nknowledge which is so necessary for them to pursue advantageously either\r\nbranch of their profession, it is much to be regretted; but there is now\r\nno reason why they should continue in darkness any longer. I know that\r\nit requires years of study and practice to become an artist, but it does\r\nnot require a very great amount of mental labour or sacrifice of time to\r\nbecome an artistic photographer. A little hard study of the subject as\r\nit appears in the columns of your journal and those of your\r\ncontemporaries--for I notice that they have _all_ suddenly become alive\r\nto the necessity of imparting to photographers a knowledge of art\r\nprinciples--will soon take the scales off the eyes of a man that is\r\nblind in art, and enable him to comprehend the mysteries of lines,\r\nunity, and light and shade, and give him the power to compose his\r\nsubject as readily as he could give a composing draught to an infant,\r\nand teach him to determine at a glance the light, shade, and atmospheric\r\neffects that would most harmonize with the scene to be represented.\r\nSupposing that he is master of the mechanical manipulations of\r\nphotography, he has acquired half the skill of the artist; and by\r\nstudying and applying the rules of composition and light and shade to\r\nhis mechanical skill, he is then equal to the artist in the treatment of\r\nhis subject, so far as the means he employs will or can enable him to\r\ngive an art rendering of nature, fixed and immovable.\r\n\r\nI do not profess to be a teacher, but I do think it is much more genial\r\nin spirit, and becoming the dignity of a man, to impart what little\r\nknowledge he has to others, than to scoff at those who do not know so\r\nmuch. If, therefore, Mr. Editor, in the course of my peregrinations, I\r\nsee an opportunity of calling your attention, and, through you, the\r\nattention of others, to any glaring defects or absurdities in the\r\npractice of our dearly beloved art, I shall not hesitate to do so; not,\r\nhowever, with any desire to carp and cavil at them for cavilling's sake,\r\nbut with the more laudable desire of pointing them out, that they may be\r\navoided. During the coming summer I shall have, or hope to have, many\r\nopportunities of seeing and judging, and will endeavour to keep you duly\r\nadvised of what is passing before me.\r\n\r\nMy letters may come from all parts--N., E., W., and S.--so that they\r\nwill, in that sense at least, harmonize with the nomenclature of your\r\nperiodical. Where I may be at the date of my writing, the post-mark will\r\nreveal to you. And now I must consider my signature: much is in a name,\r\nyou know. I can hardly call myself your \"Special Correspondent\"--that\r\nwould be too much _a la Sala_; nor can I subscribe myself an \"Old\r\nPhotographer,\" for that would be taking possession of another man's\r\nproperty, and might lead to confusion, if not to difficulties; neither\r\ncan I style myself a \"Peripatetic Photographer\"--though I am one--for\r\nthat name sometimes appears in the columns of a contemporary; and my own\r\nname is such a long one, consisting of nearly half the letters of the\r\nalphabet. Well, I think, all things considered, I cannot do better than\r\nretain my old _nom de plume_. And with many apologies for this long,\r\nroundabout paper, and every expression of regard, I beg to subscribe\r\nmyself your obliged and humble servant,\r\n\r\nLux Graphicus (J. Werge).\r\n\r\n_March 27th, 1868._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"LUX GRAPHICUS\" ON THE WING.\r\n\r\nOxford and Cambridge--Cabinet Portraits--Mr. McLachlan's Secret.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Editor,--Do not let the above heading alarm you. I have no\r\ndesire to convert the columns of your valuable journal into a kind of\r\nphotographic _Bell's Life_ or _Sporting Chronicle_. Although the great\r\nUniversity boat race has just been decided for the eighth consecutive\r\ntime in favour of Oxford, it is not of that aquatic struggle that I am\r\ngoing to write, but of another matter in which the Cantabs seem to be\r\nbehind the Oxonians in the race of life, or the pursuit of novelties.\r\nNot only are the Cantabs short in their stroke with the oars, and unable\r\nto obtain the first place in the contests on the Thames, they are also\r\nslow in giving their orders for a certain article of commerce which is\r\nof very great importance to professional photographers, especially those\r\nin the neighbourhood of the University of Cambridge. It is a remarkable\r\nfact, that while Oxford has gone in with a rush for those very charming\r\nportraits technically named \"cabinets,\" Cambridge holds aloof. How is\r\nthis, I wonder. There are as good photographers in Cambridge--Mr.\r\nMayland, to wit, whose work is all of the first class--as in Oxford; the\r\nsun shines as brightly in the region of the Cam as he does in that of\r\nthe Isis. Have the Cantabs made up their minds not to be _cabinet_ men\r\nin opposition to Oxford? or is the fact due to the lukewarmness of the\r\nCambridge photographers themselves? It seems somewhat strange that two\r\nplaces likely to be so similar in tastes and a refined appreciation of\r\nthe beautiful should so differ in this respect. Are the men of the two\r\ngreat seats of learning in this country opposed in matters of\r\nphotographic proportion as they are in other matters of minor\r\nimportance--as in the proper pronunciation of either and neither, for\r\ninstance? Not having graduated at either, I do not know which is\r\ncorrect, neither do I care; but I am concerned in this question of\r\nphotography. While at Oxford the cabinet picture has taken deep root,\r\nand has grown into a strong and vigorous article of demand, it is a\r\nwell-known fact that at Cambridge it is \"sicklied o'er with the pale\r\ncast of thought,\" and languishes on in a state trembling between life\r\nand death. Whether the producers or consumers are to blame for this\r\nlangour in the demand for an article that is certainly worth being\r\ncultivated, is more than I can say. I know that the discrepancy exists,\r\nand the rest I leave to those most immediately interested. It cannot,\r\nhowever, be supposed that a demand for any particular size or style can\r\nspring up spontaneously; that must be created by the producer, by\r\npopularising the style in some attractive and judicious manner, and the\r\ncabinet size is well deserving of a very strenuous effort being made in\r\nits favour.\r\n\r\nOf all the photographic sizes that have been introduced to the public,\r\nthe cabinet is the most artistic in its proportions. As nearly as\r\npossible it falls under that art rule of producing an oblong or\r\nparallelogram of the most agreeable proportions, which is as the\r\ndiagonal is to the square. The size of the cabinet is 5-1/2 by 4, and if\r\nyou measure the diagonal of the square of 4 inches, you will find that\r\nthe length of the cabinet, 5-1/2 inches, is as near that as possible.\r\nDoubtless Mr. Window had this in view when he introduced the size, and\r\nwhether for upright or horizontal pictures, such proportions are\r\ndecidedly the best. Many of the sizes already in use are too long,\r\nothers are too short and square. In addition to the beautiful\r\nproportions of the cabinet size, it gives the portrait photographer more\r\nroom and opportunities to introduce harmonious forms and effects in the\r\nposing and arrangements of portraits and groups; and I have seen some\r\nvery charming views on the cabinet size, 5-1/2 by 4 inches horizontally;\r\nas well as some very beautiful interiors of Westminster Abbey, by Mr. V.\r\nBlanchard, on the cabinet cards vertical, which proves pretty\r\nconclusively that the proportions of the diagonal to the square of any\r\nsize will suit both vertical and horizontal pictures. I have not the\r\nleast doubt but a much greater demand for those cabinet pictures, both\r\nportrait and landscape, could be created, if photographers would set\r\nabout introducing them with a will: depend upon it if they will but put\r\ntheir heart into the matter, they would put money into their pockets. I\r\nknow how much has been done by launching them fearlessly on the sea of\r\npublic patronage in several localities, and I feel certain the demand\r\nwould be much more general if the cabinet picture were judiciously\r\nintroduced. Mr. H. P. Robinson and Mr. Nelson K. Cherrill, having\r\nentered into partnership, are on the point of opening a photographic\r\nestablishment at Tunbridge Wells, where they intend to incur\r\nconsiderable expense to introduce the cabinet portrait, and give it that\r\nprominence it so justly merits.\r\n\r\nSince writing you last, I learn from a friend who is intimate with Mr.\r\nMcLachlan that there is every possibility of his secret being revealed\r\nere long. That this secret formula will be an immense boon to all\r\nphotographers, there can be little doubt. If an absolute immunity from\r\nstreaks in the direction of the dip, brain-markings, and pinholes--which\r\nare the advantages said to be derived from the process--can be\r\nguaranteed, then will the manipulatory part of photography be at once\r\nmade easy; and Mr. McLachlan will have conferred a personal obligation\r\non every photographic manipulator. Not only will photographers be\r\nbenefitted by Mr. McLachlan's generous conduct, the whole world will\r\nparticipate in the advantages he intends to place as a gift in the hands\r\nof photographers; and even _art_, that is so afraid of a photographic\r\namalgamation, will be _honoured_ by the revelation. But once let the\r\nmind of the operator be for ever free from the cares and anxieties of\r\nhis negative being clean, spotless, and excellent in quality, he will\r\nthen have more time and inclination to put his art knowledge, if he have\r\nany, into practice, by paying more attention to the pose of his sitters\r\nand the artistic choice and arrangement of accessories. If he be without\r\nart knowledge he will be obliged to acquire it and put it into practice,\r\nor be driven out of his field of operations. For, if the chemical\r\ndifficulties and uncertainties are to be so summarily disposed of, and\r\nall the manipulations reduced to a certainty and dead level, a\r\npre-eminence in the profession can only be maintained by him who\r\nexhibits a taste, feeling, and love for his labours superior to the\r\ndesire to palm upon the public, for mere gain, works that are a disgrace\r\nand a scandal to the profession of which he is a member. That such a\r\ncondition of things photographic may be quickly brought about is much to\r\nbe desired, and if such be the result of Mr. McLachlan's very noble\r\nwillingness to give to the photographic community experiences that have\r\ncost him much time and money in acquiring by close observation and\r\nexperiment, he will, at the least, be entitled to the sincere and hearty\r\nacknowledgments of all well-wishers and lovers of our art-science.\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ of clean and easy development, I should like to know if any of\r\nyour numerous readers have tried the effect of sulphate of zinc with the\r\niron developer. I understand its use obviates the necessity of using\r\nacetic acid as a retardant; that the deposit of silver is much more\r\ndelicate than that produced by iron alone; that the control over it is\r\nvery great; that any amount of intensity can be obtained by one or more\r\napplications, without the aid of pyrogallic acid, and without producing\r\nharshness or hardness. With such recommendations it is certainly worth a\r\ntrial. I have had no time to try it myself, but think it is of\r\nsufficient importance to give your readers an opportunity of\r\nexperimenting with it, and judging for themselves.\r\n\r\n_Photographic News, April 10th, 1868._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"LUX GRAPHICUS\" ON THE WING.\r\n\r\nThe Late Lord Brougham--New Fields for Photography--Natural Objects\r\nColoured--The Monochrome and Autotype--Mr. McLachlan again.\r\n\r\nDeath has just swept away one of the most gigantic intellects of the\r\nnineteenth century. For me to state what the late Lord Brougham was, or\r\nattempt to enumerate his vast attainments, or measure the strength of\r\nhis colossal mind, would be a piece of intolerable presumption; but I\r\nthink I may safely say that he was an enthusiastic admirer of\r\nphotography. Years ago, in the midst of his parliamentary and other\r\npressing duties, whenever he could find time to enjoy the quiet of\r\nBrougham Hall, near Penrith, his giant mind was not above indulging in\r\nthe delightful relaxation it afforded; and many a pleasant hour he used\r\nto spend chatting with Mr. Jacob Thompson, an artist of great ability,\r\nand also a very early amateur photographer, on the wonderful results\r\nobtained by the new art. The late Lord Brougham began his literary\r\ncareer by publishing a treatise on \"Light,\" before photography was known\r\nor thought to be practicable; in after life he interested himself in its\r\nmarvellous productions, and his last literary labour was also about\r\nlight. Not only did the great statesman \"know a little of everything,\"\r\nhe did a little in everything. The deceased lord took a lively interest\r\nin the progress of photography during his lifetime, from its earliest\r\nintroduction to within a short period of his death; and it would have\r\nbeen a graceful and fitting compliment to the memory of the great man of\r\nlaw, politics, literature, and science, if the English newspapers had\r\nembellished their memoirs of the late Lord Brougham with a photographic\r\nportrait of his lordship. Such a thing is quite practicable, and has\r\nbeen done successfully by our more enterprising confreres in Canada and\r\nthe United States. The _Montreal Weekly Herald_ of April 18th\r\nillustrates its memoir of the late Mr. T. d'Arcy McGhee with a very\r\nexcellent carte-de-visite portrait of the lamented and unfortunate\r\nCanadian Minister, mounted on the upper corner of the front page,\r\nsurrounded with a deep black border. What an appropriate accompaniment\r\nsuch a presentation would have been to the able articles and memoirs\r\nwhich appeared in the daily press on Monday, May 11th, 1868! How much\r\nmore interesting and valuable those clever biographical sketches of\r\ngreat men, as they pass away to their rest, which appear in the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ and other daily and weekly papers, would appear if\r\nillustrated with a photograph from life! That it can be done the\r\n_Montreal Weekly Herald_ has recently and satisfactorily shown; and\r\nsurely there is enterprise, spirit, and wealth enough among the British\r\nnewspaper proprietors to follow the very laudable example of our\r\ntransatlantic cousins. Negatives of great men are always attainable, and\r\nthere need be no commercial difficulty between the photographer and\r\nnewspaper proprietor on the score of supply. A multiplication of\r\nnegatives or Woodbury's process, would afford all the necessary\r\nfacilities for producing the prints in large numbers.\r\n\r\nMany new fields for the good of photography are opening up. Pathological\r\nworks have been photographically illustrated with some amount of\r\nsuccess. But far pleasanter fields are open to enterprising\r\nphotographers in the faithful representation of natural objects, such as\r\nflowers, fruits, ferns, grasses, shrubs, trees, shells, seaweeds, birds,\r\nbutterflies, moths, and every variety of animal life, from the lowest\r\norders to the highest. I believe the time is not far distant when the\r\nbest works on all the physical sciences will be illustrated by coloured\r\nphotographs. Those very beautiful German photographs of flowers recently\r\nintroduced show most conclusively of what photography is capable as a\r\nhelp to a study of the natural sciences. The flowers are not only\r\nphotographed from nature, but exquisitely coloured after the same\r\nfountain of truth; and the sense of reality, roundness, and relief which\r\nthey convey is truly wonderful.\r\n\r\nHitherto the colouring of natural objects photographed from nature has\r\nbeen a very difficult thing to accomplish; but now it is done, and with\r\na marvellous success.\r\n\r\nThe monochromatic process is also making great strides in advance. Those\r\nvery beautiful transparencies, cabinet size, of the Queen and Royal\r\nFamily are now to be seen in most of the photographic picture\r\nshop-windows in town and country. These transparencies are the\r\nproductions of the Disderi Company, by Woodbury's photo-relief process,\r\nand the results now obtained are really beautiful, both in effect and\r\ncolour, and sold at a very low price. But the _chef d'oeuvre_ of all\r\nmonochromatic effects has just been achieved by the triple labours of\r\nMr. Macnee, the artist, and Mr. Annan, the photographer, of Glasgow, and\r\nMr. J. W. Swan, of Newcastle. The subject in question is a work of art\r\nin every respect. The original is a full-length portrait of Lord\r\nBelhaven, painted by Daniel Macnee, and now in the Royal Academy\r\nExhibition. A photograph taken from the painting by Mr. Annan was worked\r\nup in monochrome by the eminent artist, from which another negative was\r\ntaken by the same skilful photographer, and placed in the hands of Mr.\r\nJ. W. Swan to be printed in carbon, which the latter gentleman has done\r\nin the most admirable manner. Altogether, the result is the most\r\nsatisfactory reproduction by photography that has ever been placed\r\nbefore the public, and is less like a photograph and more like a fine\r\nmezzotint engraving than anything I ever saw. Mr. Annan is now\r\npublishing the work on his own responsibility, and a specimen of it can\r\nbe seen at the offices of \"The Autotype Printing and Publishing Co.,\" 5,\r\nHaymarket, London. Mr. Hill, of Edinburgh, is also about to publish, in\r\ncarbon, a photograph of that beautifully painted picture entitled \"A\r\nFairy Raid,\" which was exhibited last year in the rooms of the Royal\r\nAcademy by Sir Noel Paton. As in the former case, Mr. Annan copied the\r\npainting, Sir Noel worked on a print in monochrome, which was again\r\nphotographed by Mr. Annan, and the negative passed to Mr. J. W. Swan to\r\nbe printed in carbon. I understand that Poynter's celebrated picture of\r\n\"Israel in Egypt\" is about to be published, in a similar manner, by the\r\nAutotype Company. It is therefore quite evident that photography is\r\nbecoming, in reality, more and more \"a foe to graphic art,\" and\r\neclipsing the lights and deepening the shadows of the _unluxy_ engraver.\r\n\r\nMr. McLachlan has again spoken without giving any very materially new\r\nfacts, or throwing much more light on his mysterious mode of working.\r\nThe great point is, to throw light on the concentrated solution of\r\nnitrate of silver; and until that has been done it will be impossible\r\nfor any one to say from experience and practice that there is nothing in\r\nthe principle. Mr. McLachlan attributes a chemical property to the\r\naction of light on the bath that has never been thought of before, and\r\nhe seems to believe it so sincerely himself, and expresses his\r\nconvictions so earnestly, that I think photographers are somewhat bound\r\nto wait patiently till time and light will enable them to comply with\r\nall the conditions he lays down, and make a series of careful\r\nexperiments, before they can say whether they are under obligations to\r\nhim or not. At any rate, natural justice suggests that they should not\r\nrender a foregone verdict.\r\n\r\n_May 17th, 1868._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition of National Portraits--The Tintype of America--The Spirit\r\nof Photography in Canada--The \"Wise Week,\" and the Total Eclipse of the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Editor,--From various causes I have been absent from your\r\ncolumns as a contributor for some time, but not as a reader. The chief\r\nreason for this was the weather, which of late has been so hot and\r\nprostrating as to dry up both my ink and my energies. Now that the\r\natmosphere is more cool, moist, and pleasant, my ink and my thoughts may\r\nflow together, and the resulting epistle may find a place on some page\r\nof the Photographic News; if not, I shall not be angry. I know that the\r\nworld--and photography is my world--is not always mindful of its atoms.\r\nThe great and immortal Cicero discovered that even he could be absent\r\nfrom Rome, and all Rome not know it. How much easier, then, for your\r\nreaders not to discover my absence from your pages. But my inability to\r\nwrite and attend to other duties entailed more serious losses to myself.\r\nAmongst others I missed seeing the Royal Academy Exhibition, but found a\r\ncompensating pleasure in going to see the Exhibition of National\r\nPortraits at South Kensington. What a school it is for photographers!\r\nWhat a variety of pose, arrangement, management of light and shade, is\r\nto be seen in that glorious collection of Vandykes, Hogarths,\r\nGainsboroughs, Reynolds, Opies, Wilkies, Raeburns, Northcotes,\r\nLawrences, Phillips, Shees, Richmonds, Grants, and many others of the\r\npresent day! I hope many photographers have seen the collection. None\r\nought to have missed the opportunity. All that saw must have profited by\r\nthe sight. Portraits of great men that have been familiar to me in black\r\nand white for years were there before me in the rich mellow colouring of\r\nVandyke, Reynolds, Wilkie, and Lawrence, and the mind seemed carried\r\nback into the past while looking at the works of those great artists.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition will soon close, and all that have not seen it should\r\nendeavour to do so at once. There may never again be seen such a\r\ngathering together of the great of England, painted by England's\r\ngreatest portrait painters. The Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition was\r\na great assemblage of the glory of England, but it was not so complete,\r\nnor so instructive, nor so comfortable to view as that now open at South\r\nKensington. In addition to the paintings there is a large and valuable\r\ncollection of rare engravings, both in mezzotints and in line. The\r\nlatter collection alone would make a visit highly pleasing, and, in a\r\nsense, remunerative to every photographer. Art is beginning to take\r\nroot in the minds of those who follow photography, either professionally\r\nor for amusement, and those exhibitions are the salt that \"savoureth the\r\nearth,\" which in due time will bring forth rich fruits.\r\n\r\nThe \"Tintype\" is now being largely practised in America, and is fitted\r\ninto an envelope or slip, carte-de-visite size. The slip is formed of\r\npaper, with an aperture to show the picture, and a flap to fall over it\r\nas a protector. I had some of these shown to me a short time ago. The\r\ntintype is only another name for the ferrotype or melainotype, which is\r\na collodion positive picture taken on a piece of tin or iron, coated\r\nwith black japan on the front, and a varnish on the back, to prevent the\r\nmetal from acting on the bath. The carte-de-visite form of the tintype\r\nfitted in the envelope or holder is a very good and ready way of\r\nsupplying all portraits wanted in a hurry, and its adoption might be\r\nfound very serviceable to many photographers in England. The American\r\nexamples that I have seen are very brilliant and beautiful, and, to my\r\nmind, next in delicacy of detail and richness of colour to the long\r\ndiscarded but ever beautiful Daguerreotype. I must admit, _en passant_,\r\nthat the Americans always excelled in producing fine, brilliant\r\nDaguerreotypes, and it is much the same with them in the production of\r\nglass positives, ferrotypes, or tintypes.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of photography in America and Canada is admirable. Mr.\r\nNotman, of Montreal, has long been doing some excellent cabinet pictures\r\nrepresenting out-of-door-life, pleasures, and pastimes. Now Mr. Inglis,\r\nof Montreal, also produces most beautiful carte-de-visite and cabinet\r\npictures of indoor and out-of-door scenes, such as drawing-rooms,\r\nlibraries, &c., with suitably arranged and occupied figures in the\r\nformer, and boating, bathing, and fishing parties in the latter. Some of\r\nthese pictures have recently been shown to me. They are all very fine\r\nexamples of photography. The tone and quality of some are beautiful.\r\nMany of them are admirably arranged, and exhibit considerable knowledge\r\nof composition; but some of them, particularly the interiors, are sadly\r\nat fault in their chiaroscuro. They possess no dominant light, or, if\r\nthey do, it is in the wrong place, leading the eye away from the\r\nprincipal object. In most cases the lights are too scattered, giving a\r\nspotty and flickering effect to the picture, which is painful to look\r\nat. With his out-of-door scenes Mr. Inglis is more happy, and probably,\r\nfrom his antecedents, more at home. For example, the \"Boating Party\" is\r\nvery happily composed, embracing the double form of angular\r\ncomposition--the triangle and the lozenge--and just a little more skill\r\nor care would have made it perfect in its lines. The whole scene is well\r\nlighted and got up. The boat, foreground of pebbles, stones, shrubs, and\r\ntrees are all real; the water is represented by tin-foil, wet black\r\noilcloth, or something of the kind, which reflects the forms and colours\r\nof objects placed upon or above it. The reflections seem too sharp to be\r\nthose of water. The plan adopted by Mr. Ross, of Edinburgh, is the best.\r\nThat gentleman has a large shallow trough fitted up in his studio with\r\nwater in it.\r\n\r\nSurely such pictures of groups of friends and families would take in\r\nLondon and the provinces if people only knew where to get them. At\r\npresent I know there is not a place in London where photographic\r\npictures possessing such a variety and interest can be obtained. Mr.\r\nFaulkner is the only photographer that has yet attempted to produce such\r\nrural subjects in London, but I am not aware that he has yet introduced\r\n\"the boat\" into his studio.\r\n\r\nThis is the \"Wise Week,\" and it is to be hoped that the gathering\r\ntogether of the wisdom of the world at Norwich will in some way be\r\nbeneficial to photography. You, Mr. Editor, I presume, will attend the\r\nmeetings, and I shall look forward with considerable interest to your\r\ngleanings from the harvest of science that will this year be garnered in\r\nthe transactions of the British Association.\r\n\r\nAs I think of the date to affix to my letter, I am reminded that this is\r\nthe day of the great total eclipse, visible in India, and that several\r\nexpeditions are engaged in taking observations. The photographic\r\narrangements, I notice, are more than usually complete, and I most\r\nsincerely hope that the astronomical photographers are favoured with\r\nbright and calm weather, so that they may succeed in obtaining the best\r\nphotographic representations of the phenomenon. In this I am not\r\ninfluenced by the mere photographic idea of getting a picture, but\r\nrather with the hope that photography may be the legitimate and\r\nhonourable handmaiden to the savants, astronomers, and mathematicians in\r\nenabling them to ascertain the constitutional condition, mode of\r\nsustenance, and interminable length of life of the great source of all\r\nour labours and achievements. Then would the sun write his\r\nautobiography, and his amanuensis would be his favoured child,\r\nphotography.\r\n\r\n_August 18th, 1868._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Harvest is over, the Granaries are Full, yet Famine is in our\r\nMidst--Photographers' Benevolent and Provident Societies--Photography\r\nEnnobled--Revival of the Eburneum Process--The Societies and the Coming\r\nSession--Photographic Apparatus _v._ Personal Luggage.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Editor,--My quill is as restless as my wing, and, as I skim\r\nabout like the swallows, many things fall under my observation that\r\nwould otherwise not do so, some of which are noteworthy and of interest\r\nto the photographic profession, many are not; but harvest time is\r\ninteresting to everyone, and it is of this I am going to make a few\r\nremarks. It is always a subject of grave importance and anxiety to a\r\nnation like ours, with a very limited area of cereal land, until it is\r\nknown whether the harvest has been abundant or otherwise. It is also\r\nequally important that the harvest, however plentiful, should be\r\ncarefully reaped and garnered, so that famine may not fall upon the\r\npeople before another season of plenty shall come in its course. The\r\ncereal harvest is over, and has been wonderfully abundant, in spite of\r\nthe unusually long, dry, and hot summer. The stack-yards are full, and\r\nthe granaries are teeming with plenty, and there is bread enough for all\r\nthat can afford to buy. There, that is the qualification that brings to\r\nmy mind the most serious part of this subject. Although the season has\r\nbeen wonderfully fine and favourable for a rich harvest of all things,\r\n\"famine is in our midst.\" A cry of woe is mingled with our mirth. A\r\nglorious summer and autumn have, on the whole, yielded a rich reward to\r\nthe labourers in the pleasant and profitable fields of photography; yet\r\nthere is want among some of the workers. In the columns of your\r\ncontemporary I observe a letter \"begging alms\" on behalf of a poor widow\r\nand her little orphans. It is a case of pure charity, and far be it from\r\nme to say to anyone, \"Do not help her;\" \"They have no claim on the\r\nsympathies of the photographic public;\" \"Neither she nor her late\r\nhusband did anything to forward the progress of the art nor advance the\r\ninterests of photographers in general.\" I grant the latter hypothesis,\r\nand say, \"He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.\" Nevertheless,\r\nI cannot refrain from expressing my opinion that such painful appeals\r\nshould not be allowed to appear in the columns of the photographic\r\njournals; all such private cases could and should be provided for by any\r\nof the provident organisations so common to other trades. The subject\r\nhas been frequently mooted in your own columns, but no action has been\r\ntaken. Very recently a lady correspondent called attention to the\r\nsubject again, and now, in the pages of your contemporary, I notice an\r\nelaborate plan is laid down as the ground-work of a Photographers'\r\nProvident and Benevolent Society. That plan is open to some objections,\r\nbut it is certainly desirable that such a society should be formed. It\r\nis rather late in the season for photographers to make any provision for\r\ncases 1 and 2, as the correspondent in your contemporary suggests--this\r\nyear, at least; but I think his other plan of making a provision,\r\nhowever small, for widows and orphans is highly to be commended, and, if\r\nonly carried into effect, would undoubtedly mitigate the anguish and\r\nlessen the fear of want in the minds of many deserving women, and might\r\nprevent the recurrence of those painful appeals to which I have just\r\nalluded. It is just as important and imperative a duty for every man to\r\nmake some sort of provision for those dependent upon him as it is for\r\nthe husbandman to reap and carefully house his harvest. Knowing the\r\ninterest which you, Mr. Editor, personally take in this subject, I trust\r\nthat you will exert your influence, and see if it be possible to found a\r\nsociety _at once_ that will grow in after years to be a monument to\r\nphotography and to the goodness and forethought of the photographers of\r\nthe present generation.\r\n\r\nPhotography, like the fine arts, is honoured with a title of nobility. A\r\nbaronetcy has recently fallen to the lot of one who for years has\r\nfollowed photography as a profession, taking cartes-de-visite and other\r\nphotographs in the usual business-like manner. Of all the styles of\r\ndistinction that are conferred upon men, I think baronetcies have been\r\nsubject to the greatest number of vicissitudes, and spiced with the\r\ngreatest amount of romance, from the romantic succession of Sir Robert\r\nInnes to Sir William Don, \"a poor player;\" and now the photographic\r\nprofession includes among its members one of the baronets of England.\r\n\r\nYour description of the Eburneum process, given recently in your \"Visits\r\nto Noteworthy Studios,\" has awakened quite a new interest in that\r\nbeautiful form of photograph, introduced a few years ago by Mr. Burgess.\r\nSeveral photographers whom I know have set about producing them. The\r\nspecimens which I have seen are very beautiful as cards, but they are\r\nparticularly suitable for lockets, brooches, studs, pins, rings, &c.,\r\nbeing sharp, clear, and delicate, and easily cut to fit any size or\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nNext month some of the London photographic societies will commence the\r\nsession of 1868-9, and it might be asked, What are their prospects? It\r\nis to be hoped that the North London will do better than it did last\r\nsession. There was more than one _nil_ meeting. The South London will\r\ndoubtless keep up its character, and exhibit its usual vitality. The\r\npersonal interest taken in the meetings by their kind, genial, and\r\ncourteous President is almost sure to develop all the latent force of\r\nthe members. It is also to be hoped that _the_ Society will make as\r\nbrilliant a start as it did at the commencement of the session last\r\nNovember. Such an exhibition as that in Conduit Street may easily be\r\nrepeated, though it may not be such a startling one.\r\n\r\nThe question raised, whether photographic apparatus be or be not\r\nconsidered \"personal luggage\" by the railway companies, is one of very\r\ngreat importance to photographers, but particularly to amateurs, for if\r\ndecided against them it will cause no end of inconvenience, vexation,\r\nand expense by delays and extra charges. On the other hand, it must be\r\nadmitted that the view taken by the railway authorities is technically\r\ncorrect. The very word \"personal\" shows that they mean such articles as\r\nare really and absolutely necessary for the personal comfort and\r\nconvenience of travellers, which can only rightly include wearing\r\napparel, changes of linen, dressing-cases, ladies' work boxes, and\r\nwriting desks. These are absolutely indispensable for the comfort and\r\nconvenience of travellers. Photographic apparatus, and particularly\r\nchemicals, do not come under that classification, and I think it is of\r\ngreat consequence to the railway companies and their passengers to know\r\nwhat should, or should not, be put into the \"luggage van.\" I know a case\r\nwhere an amateur photographer was travelling by rail with a 12 by 10\r\nbath full of nitrate of silver solution packed among his clothes in a\r\nbox in the luggage van. The bath leaked, the solution spoiled all his\r\nshirts, and he was driven to the shift of papering the fronts. Now,\r\nsupposing the box containing the leaky bath had stood upon someone\r\nelse's box--say a lady's--it might have run through and spoiled some\r\nvaluable dresses; at the least, it would have spoiled the appearance of\r\nthe box, to the great annoyance of the lady passenger, and the probable\r\nclaim on the company for compensation. There are always two sides to a\r\nquestion, and though few men have travelled more with photographic\r\napparatus in the luggage van than myself, I think, in this case, the\r\nbest of the argument may be fairly ceded to the railway companies.\r\n\r\n_September 18th, 1868._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"LUX GRAPHICUS\" ON THE WING.\r\n\r\nHis Flight to and from the Exhibition of the Photographic Society.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Editor,--On Tuesday night last I took the liberty of looking\r\ninto the rooms of the Architectural Society, to see the photographs, and\r\nlisten to the gossip of the visitors at the _conversazione_ of the\r\nPhotographic Society. To hear the complimentary remarks and the\r\nexclamations of pleasure was as delightful to my ear as the first song\r\nof the lark in spring.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage--not brilliant, but genial, pleasant, and happy--was as\r\nrefreshing to the eye as the first glimpse of the vernal flowers; and\r\nthe pictures hung upon the walls and screens, and laid upon the tables,\r\nwere, in more senses than one, a feast to the mind almost without alloy.\r\nFor my own part, I felt so joyful, I could not help fluttering my wings,\r\nshaking my feathers, and flitting about from one place to another,\r\nchirping, chatting, and pecking lovingly about this pretty thing, and at\r\nthat old friend, till long after my usual time of going to roost. And\r\nwhen I did at last tear myself away and fly home, I could not help\r\nexclaiming, Well, there never was a pleasanter evening nor a nicer\r\nexhibition in the whole history of the Society! But I could not sleep;\r\nI put my head under my wing, shook my feathers, and tried to settle into\r\nthe most comfortable and cosy positions, but it was no use. The pretty\r\nlandscapes and pleasing portraits I had seen shone brighter and brighter\r\nbefore me; I was compelled to mentally review them; and here follows the\r\nresult of my incubations. My first thoughts were to work the pleasures\r\nof the evening by a kind of rule-of-three process, by considering the\r\nvalue of the landscapes and portraits exhibited, to arrive at the worth\r\nof the exhibition; but not so much in a money point of view, as in the\r\nmerits of the works, and their probable influences on the workers.\r\n\r\nTaking the landscape portion of the exhibition as first in the order\r\ninto which I had mentally catalogued the pictures, it was an easy and\r\ndelightful thing to skim over such a vast extent of this world's surface\r\nthat evening. To journey to and from the glens of Scotland, the dales of\r\nEngland and Wales, the lakes of Ireland, the mountains of the Tyrol, to\r\nAbyssinia and the famous heights of Magdala, was but the work of a few\r\nminutes, thanks to the purveyors of that mental banquet. But to do full\r\njustice to the exhibitors I must endeavour to enumerate their principal\r\nworks, and comment thereon with the utmost impartiality. Most\r\nunquestionably the gems of the landscape portion of the exhibition were\r\neight exquisite little pictures by Mr. Russell Manners Gordon, affording\r\nunmistakable proof of what the gum-gallico dry process is capable of\r\nyielding in his hands. It is almost, if not quite, equal to the wet\r\nprocess for detail and delicacy. This is particularly noticeable in the\r\nview of Carnarvon Castle. Indeed, Mr. Bedford's picture of the same\r\nsubject--which, I presume, is by the wet process--on the other side of\r\nthe screen, contrasts rather unfavourably with it. Mr. Gordon's\r\nselection of his point of sight, and general treatment of that subject\r\nalone, are unmistakable proofs of his refined taste and feeling for the\r\nart capabilities of landscape photography. The wet collodion pictures by\r\nMr. Gordon are also beautiful examples of the art. His cottages with\r\nsheep browsing in the foreground, which is an instantaneous picture, is\r\nremarkable for its beauty and arrangement. These pictures are\r\nbeautifully printed, and possess a tone which harmonizes charmingly with\r\nthe subjects. Amongst the other landscape photographers Mr. England and\r\nMr. Bedford stand unrivalled in their peculiar branches. The views in\r\nthe Tyrol, lately taken by Mr. England, are so excellent that they\r\ncannot but add to that gentleman's high reputation.\r\n\r\nMr. Bedford's views are also quite equal, if not superior, to his\r\npreviously-exhibited works. Some pretty views of the Lakes of Killarney\r\nby Mr. Archibald Irvine were well worthy of notice. Mr. F. Beasley,\r\nJunr., exhibited some very excellent examples of the Fothergill process;\r\nsome printed in silver, and others in carbon, from the same negatives. I\r\nthink the carbon prints were superior in colour, but the silver prints\r\npossess most detail and depth. Views of Wimbledon and other places by\r\nMr. Vernon Heath were also good examples of that gentleman's\r\nphotography. Some beautiful cloud effects by Messrs. Robinson and\r\nCherrill, of Tunbridge Wells, and Mr. Fox, of Brighton, attracted\r\nconsiderable attention, and elicited great praise. The large composition\r\npicture, \"Returning Home,\" by Mr. Robinson, was greatly admired by\r\nnearly everyone that looked at it. One or two ill-natured or ignorant\r\nremarks were made about that picture, but I candidly think it is the\r\nvery best picture that Mr. Robinson has produced. The sunshine on the\r\none side, and the rain storm sweeping over the other, are both cleverly\r\nand artistically managed. I am sorry I cannot say the same of the group\r\nof children which hung near the latter. The group, though perfect in its\r\nphotographic details and tone, is too suggestive of scissors and paste\r\nto be a good picture, in my estimation.\r\n\r\nMr. Wardley's large Taupenot pictures were very excellent. The very\r\ninteresting pictures of Abyssinia by the 10th Company of Engineers were\r\nvery attractive. Groups of the captives--political, religious, and\r\nartisan, with their families--and the officers of the Expedition, formed\r\ninteresting pictures. The views of Magdala, Theodore's house, the\r\nmushroom fortifications, and other flimsy defences, as revealed by the\r\ntruth-telling camera, seemed to lessen considerably the glory of the\r\ncapture of Magdala.\r\n\r\nHaving dismissed the landscape portion of the exhibition without\r\nmentioning all the many excellent contributions thereto, I next turn my\r\nthoughts again to the contributions of portraits. The examples of that\r\nbranch of photography were nearly all of first-rate excellence, a large\r\nnumber of them being _a la Salomon_, M. Adam-Salomon himself\r\ncontributing no less than fifteen. With one or two remarkable\r\nexceptions, these pictures were not equal to those exhibited last year,\r\nand a general feeling prevailed that they were neither his later works,\r\nnor the best of his former; still, they were a very effective display,\r\nand attracted great and deserved attention. As I have, on a former\r\noccasion, expressed my opinion on the great excellence of M. Salomon's\r\nworks, I shall not comment further thereon at present, but proceed to\r\nnotice those which most nearly approached them in photographic\r\nand artistic essentials. Undoubtedly Mr. Valentine Blanchard's\r\ncontributions, both in number and quality, come nearer to M. Salomon's\r\nworks than any other contributor's. Mr. Blanchard exhibited ten\r\nportraits _a la Salomon_, some of which are quite equal to the French\r\nartist's best works, without the elaborate working-up which the latter\r\nexhibit. Mr. Blanchard has not been at all times fortunate in his\r\nsitters, which is very much to be regretted, for we all know how much a\r\nbeautiful subject helps a good photograph. Hitherto, Mr. Blanchard has\r\nbeen an exhibitor chiefly as a landscape and figure-study photographer.\r\nNow that he has taken more kindly to portraiture, and exhibits such\r\ncapabilities for its successful practice, I hope he will find it\r\nsufficiently remunerative to induce him to be a steady and persevering\r\ndisciple of M. Salomon. Messrs. Robinson and Cherrill also exhibited two\r\nbeautiful and Salomon-like portraits: one of M. Salomon himself, and one\r\nof Mr. Hain Friswell; the latter, I think, is decidedly the best. Mr.\r\nMayland, of Cambridge, sent six very excellent portraits in Salomon's\r\nstyle, all very good but one; a gentleman in a velvet coat was\r\nparticularly successful.\r\n\r\nThe pictures exhibited by Mr. Briggs, of Leamington, though extremely\r\nforcible and beautiful, were not exactly an imitation of the style of M.\r\nSalomon.\r\n\r\nMr. Leake, of Cornhill, had a frame containing six very capital\r\nportraits in the style of the eminent French photographer, but a little\r\noverdone in after-touching--too much elaborated. In this respect he far\r\noutdid his great prototype. Messrs. Fradelle and Leach also exhibited a\r\nnumber of whole-plate pictures _a la Salomon_, which were very good\r\nindeed. Messrs. Slingsby, Burgess, Ashdown, Dunmore, and S. Fry, were\r\nalso exhibitors of the same style of portraits, 10 by 8 size; but it is\r\na pity the latter did himself the injustice of exhibiting so many, for\r\nthere was only one--an old gentleman with a grey beard--that was really\r\nworthy of him. Never did any man's joke recoil more forcibly on himself\r\nthan that of Mr. Fry's. The faces of some of his female portraits--one\r\nin particular--were, in my estimation, as flat, white, and shadowless as\r\na piece or knob of sal-ammoniac itself; but I must say that the portrait\r\nof the gentleman above referred to was all that could be desired as an\r\nartistic photograph.\r\n\r\nAmongst the cabinet pictures exhibited by English photographers, I think\r\nthose by Mr. Hubbard were decidedly the finest. One entitled \"The\r\nToilet,\" and another of a lady seated at a window, which might be named\r\n\"A Sultry Day in Town,\" are charmingly artistic photographs. A\r\ncomposition picture by the same artist was also very skilfully treated;\r\nindeed, it was mistaken by many to be a copy of a picture, and might\r\neasily have been taken for a copy of a painting by T. Faed. Mr. Briggs,\r\nMr. Godbold (of Hastings), Mr. Gillo, Messrs. Lucas and Box, also\r\nexhibited some beautiful cabinet pictures.\r\n\r\nCartes-de-visite in their ordinary form were somewhat scarce, but Dr.\r\nWallich, Mr. Charles Heath, Mr. Bateman, and others, made a good show of\r\nvignettes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cameron exhibited some large pictures in her peculiar style; but my\r\nown opinion and that of others was, that she is improving.\r\n\r\nMr. Ernest Edwards exhibited a large collection of carbon pictures, in\r\nblack and other colours; some mounted on chromo-tinted paper, and some\r\nexcellent enlargements in carbon. The Autotype Company exhibited a fine\r\ncopy of Lord Belhaven, which I noticed some time ago; also a very\r\nvaluable and beautiful collection of copies from drawings by old\r\nmasters, all bound together, making a handsome and very interesting\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nMr. Rejlander had a large collection of his art photographs on view, all\r\nof which were clever, some facetious, and many very beautiful\r\nconceptions.\r\n\r\nA frame of coloured enamels by Mr. Bailey, and some in black-and-white\r\nby Mr. Henderson and Mr. Barnes, also attracted considerable notice.\r\n\r\nThe eburneumtypes by Mr. Burgess, a coloured collodio-chloride portrait\r\non ivory by Mr. J. Edwards, and other collodio-chloride and opalotype\r\npictures, were very much admired. The cabinet vignettes by Reutlinger,\r\nand the cabinet pictures by Wenderoth, were both in request at the\r\ntable, on account of their beauty and interest.\r\n\r\nI must not forget to mention a very interesting series of twenty-four\r\nstereoscopic pictures by Mr. Alfieri, illustrative of \"The Potter's\r\nArt.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Hughes and Mr. Meagher were both exhibitors of very excellent\r\nand useful apparatus--cameras, camera-stands, and rolling-presses.\r\n\r\nNow I think such an exhibition as I have but partially described cannot\r\nfail to have produced a pleasing and beneficial effect on the minds of\r\nall who saw it, and ought, on the whole, to have given infinite pleasure\r\nand satisfaction to both exhibitors and visitors. Yet I think I heard\r\none or two growls of discontent about the hanging from someone whose\r\npictures or whose friend's pictures were not on the line; but I think I\r\nmay safely say there never was a case of hanging yet that was not\r\nobjected to by one individual at least. Even the hangers of the Royal\r\nAcademy do not escape censure, and they are supposed to have far more\r\nskill, taste, and experience in hanging than the volunteer hangers of\r\nthe late photographic exhibition. I think, however, that the hangers\r\nperformed their duties both conscientiously and creditably, especially\r\nwhen it is considered in how very short a time the work had to be done.\r\nAnyone who felt aggrieved, and expressed himself churlishly on that\r\npoint, must surely have been in that unenviable state which the French\r\nvery adroitly designate _Etre marque au B_.\r\n\r\nAfter these reflections I felt too drowsy to reflect any more, and was\r\nbarely awake enough to subscribe myself--Yours very truly.\r\n\r\n_November 10th, 1868._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Refunding of the Balance of the Goddard Fund--The Photographers'\r\nProvident Society--A Ferocious Doorsman--The South London Dinner--A\r\nChristmas Carol.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,--Now that the balance of the Goddard Fund is returned to\r\nthe contributors, and all the trials and vexations the administration of\r\nthe fund brought upon the chief promoters are known, I think the very\r\nbest thanks of the whole body of subscribers to that fund are due to the\r\ncommittee for their firm and sensible determination to provide for the\r\nwants of the poor imbecile recipient in the manner they did, and for\r\ntheir withstanding the attempt made by a person who was not in the\r\nleast related to the late Mr. Goddard to obtain possession of the\r\nbalance in hand. I, for one, a subscriber to the fund, return them my\r\nmost hearty acknowledgments, not for the money returned to me, but for\r\nthe straightforwardness of their report, and the wise and judicious\r\nmanner in which they dispensed the funds. While congratulating myself\r\nand confreres on seeing the money not required for the relief of the\r\nlate Mr. Goddard returned to the subscribers instead of going into the\r\npossession of a person for whom it never was intended, I think it is to\r\nbe regretted that no responsible party had foreseen that much of this\r\nreturned money would have been gladly placed to the credit of some\r\nbenevolent or provident institution connected with photography. The\r\nwhole amount, or even the half of it, would have made a very handsome\r\nnucleus for the commencement of such a fund. I have heard several wishes\r\nto that effect expressed during the last few days. Doubtless the\r\ncommittee did the very best thing they could have done for their own\r\ncredit and the entire satisfaction of the whole of the subscribers; but\r\nI am afraid an opportunity has been lost in the interest of the\r\nincipient relief fund by not having had a receiver for these stray and\r\nunexpected sums appointed. The praiseworthy act of Messrs. Ross and\r\nPringle, as noticed in another journal, confirms this impression.\r\n\r\nWhile the subject of a photographers' provident or relief fund is before\r\nme, I may mention that in the Report of the Friendly Societies recently\r\nissued by Mr. Tidd Pratt, he speaks in the highest terms of those\r\nsocieties which are managed by the members themselves without salaries,\r\nand condemns the extravagance exhibited by the societies of a similar\r\nnature which are conducted by salaried officials. Now, as it is a\r\nfriendly society pure and simple that sick or needy photographers ought\r\nto look to for future help, in my opinion the former is the kind of\r\nsociety that should be established. The movement is not to be started\r\nas a business speculation, and there should be no salaries attached to\r\nany of the offices. Each member joining the provident society should be\r\nprepared to submit to the tax on his time and energies, if elected to\r\noffice, as part and parcel of the amount he subscribes for the general\r\nwelfare of the body and relief of individual members. For my part, I\r\nobject to the contemplated society taking the form of a relief fund\r\ndepending upon donations, collections at dinners, &c., for its support.\r\nSuch means for raising the necessary funds to start the society may be\r\nallowable; but after it is commenced, every individual connected with it\r\nshould be a subscribing member, and not allowed to receive any benefit,\r\nexcept under the most urgent necessities, until he has paid a certain\r\nnumber of subscriptions.\r\n\r\nDuring one of my peregrinations about town lately I stumbled upon a very\r\nferocious doorsman. My attention was suddenly arrested, while passing\r\none of those photographic establishments which keep a kind of two-legged\r\nhyena prowling up and down before their doors, by hearing the somewhat\r\nstartling and cannibalistic exclamation of \"I'll eat yer!\" Looking\r\nround, I saw that one of those prowling bipeds had fastened upon two\r\nquiet-looking young gentlemen, evidently strangers in town and to town\r\nways, and had so importuned them to sit for \"a correct likeness,\" until\r\nthey turned upon him, and threatened to give him in charge if he did not\r\ndesist; when he retaliated by threatening to eat them, and used a great\r\ndeal of sanguinary and abusive language as a substitute for more\r\npalatable suavity. Is such an \"outsider\" or hanger-on a fit and proper\r\nperson to join a photographers' provident society, or be the recipient\r\nof a benevolent relief fund?\r\n\r\nThe South London Photographic Society's annual dinner came off on\r\nSaturday evening last at the \"Salutation Tavern,\" Newgate Street.\r\nTwenty-three members and friends, all told, sat down to dinner, and\r\nenjoyed a thoroughly English repast. After the cloth was removed, the\r\npleasantest part of the evening commenced. The worthy and honoured\r\npresident, the Rev. F. F. Statham, M.A., who occupied the chair, was all\r\ngeniality, and gave the toast of the evening--\"The South London\r\nPhotographic Society\"--in his usually felicitous style. To Mr. Jabez\r\nHughes was allotted the task of proposing the next important\r\ntoast--\"Photography\"--which he did in the most glowing and eloquent\r\nterms, dwelling on the rise and progress of the art in England, its\r\nposition in a competitive point of view at the Paris Exhibition,\r\ninterspersed with some racy and facetious remarks on the different modes\r\nand kinds of rewards, from the bronze, silver, and gold medals, to the\r\npaper certificates, which he considered the most honourable mentions\r\nthat could be given by a discerning public. From that he soared into the\r\nhigher aspirations of photographers and sublime regions of photography,\r\ngiving, with thrilling effect, a description of the social joys,\r\nscientific pursuits, and human ameliorations to which photography\r\nadministers. Mr. Baynham Jones, being the oldest photographer present,\r\nhad the honour of replying on behalf of the art. Mr. G. Wharton Simpson,\r\nin very appropriate terms, gave the toast, \"Art Photography,\" which was\r\nresponded to by Mr. O. G. Rejlander. Mr. Johnson, of the Autotype\r\nCompany, had the honour of proposing the toast \"Professional\r\nPhotography,\" which was responded to by Mr. Valentine Blanchard,\r\nwho occupied the vice-chair. Other toasts of a professional and\r\nsemi-professional character were given and responded to. The intervals\r\nwere filled up with part and instrumental music by members of the\r\nSociety. Mr. Cooper contributed greatly to the evening's enjoyment by\r\ngiving two charming performances on the cornet-a-piston, which were\r\nadmirably accompanied by Mr. Henry Cooper on the piano. Taking it all in\r\nall, it was one of the pleasantest and merriest evenings I have ever\r\nenjoyed at the convivial meetings of the South London Photographic\r\nSociety, and formed a delightful introduction to the season of universal\r\nfestivity which is close at hand.\r\n\r\nChristmas, all over the civilized world, is not only a period of festive\r\nreunion, but, according to the only rational interpretation of the word,\r\na time of good will towards men, and peace upon earth. Photographers,\r\nlike other men, have had their little differences of opinion, which have\r\nproduced partial estrangements during a portion of the year which will\r\nso soon expire; but let the approaching season, which is held in\r\ncommemoration of the birth of the greatest Peacemaker that ever came\r\namong men, be looked upon by all as the fittest time to forget and\r\nforgive all slights, injuries, or insults, real or imaginary; and let\r\nnot the great festival of our common faith be clouded or eclipsed by an\r\nangry thought, nor the immeasurable charity of true Christianity be\r\ndimmed by one unforgiving feeling. The light of the Christian faith is a\r\nlight that should penetrate to the dark cells of our hearts, and dispel\r\nall the gloomy and corrosive accumulations of controversy that may have\r\nlodged there, and unconsciously eaten away any part of our better\r\nnature. Few of us--none but the most presumptuous--can lay his hand upon\r\nhis heart and say, \"Mine is immaculate!\" None of us are without sin, and\r\ncharity and forgiveness are the greatest of the Christian virtues; and\r\nthey should be the more carefully studied and practised by all who live\r\nin and by the Light of the world.\r\n\r\n_December 15th, 1868._\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY AND THE IMMURED POMPEIIANS.\r\n\r\nEveryone must be sensible of the many and varied applications of\r\nphotography. Even photographers themselves, familiar as they are with\r\nthe capabilities of the art they practise, must necessarily have their\r\nwonder excited occasionally at the scope of their art-science,\r\nespecially when they consider that the process, as practised at the\r\npresent day, is not more than seventeen years old. That it should be the\r\nhistorian of the life and manners of the present period more fully and\r\nfaithfully than any written account, is not so much a matter of\r\nsurprise. Appealing, as it does, to the vanity and affections of the\r\npeople, it is at once a recorder of the changes of fashion, a registrar\r\nof marriages, births, and deaths, and a truthful illustrator of the\r\ntimes in which we live; but that it should be brought to bear upon the\r\npast, and make the inhabitants of the world in the nineteenth century\r\nfamiliar with the forms, fashions, manners, life, and death of the\r\npeople of the first century of the Christian Era, is something to be\r\nmarvelled at, and at first seems an impossibility. Yet such is the fact;\r\nand photography has been made the cheap and easy means of informing the\r\npresent generation of the manner in which the ancients behaved,\r\nsuffered, and died in the midst of one of the most appalling\r\ncatastrophes that ever overtook the inhabitants of any part of the\r\nworld, ancient or modern, as vividly and undeniably as if the calamity\r\nhad occurred but yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing reflections were excited by seeing very recently some\r\nphotographs from plaster casts of the forms of human beings as they had\r\nfallen and died when Pompeii and Herculaneum were destroyed by the first\r\nknown and terrible eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The photographs alluded\r\nto reveal with a fearful fidelity the dreadful agonies of some of those\r\nwho perished at Pompeii, and, while looking at the pictures, it is very\r\ndifficult to divest the mind of the idea that they are not the works of\r\nsome ancient photographer who plied his lens and camera immediately\r\nafter the eruption had ceased, so forcibly do they carry the mind back\r\nto the time and place of the awful immurement of both a town and its\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThat these photographs were not obtained from the lifeless forms of the\r\nPompeiians the reader will readily understand, for their bodies have not\r\nbeen preserved entire from that day to this. The question then naturally\r\narises, \"How could plaster casts be obtained from which the photographs\r\nwere produced?\" To answer that question I must briefly explain that\r\nPompeii was not, as is generally understood, destroyed by an overflow of\r\nred hot lava, which would have burnt up every particle of human flesh\r\nwith which it came in contact almost instantly, without leaving a mould\r\nor impress of the form which it surrounded. The _black mud_ which flowed\r\nfrom Vesuvius into the doomed town of Pompeii entombed the houses and\r\ninhabitants--covered them up and formed a thick crust over them, which\r\ngradually hardened, and as the bodies crumbled away to dust a mould or\r\nmatrix was left, from which plaster casts of great beauty and finish\r\nmight have been obtained of almost everything that was destroyed.\r\nUnfortunately, this was not discovered until very recently, after many\r\nof the beautiful moulds had been destroyed by the process of hurried,\r\nthoughtless, and unsystematic excavation. It was only a short time\r\nago, since Naples was united to Italy, that careful and intelligent\r\nexcavation secured to future generations impressions from those matrices\r\nmade by the most terrible process of natural mould making.\r\n\r\nSig. Fiorelli, who was appointed superintendent of excavations at\r\nPompeii, happily thought of obtaining casts from these natural moulds by\r\npouring in soft plaster of Paris, and thus secure more useful mementos\r\nthan by preserving the moulds themselves. Amongst the first casts thus\r\nobtained were the forms of four human beings, described as follows in\r\nthe _Quarterly Review_ for 1864:--\r\n\r\n\"These four persons had perished in the streets. Driven from their\r\nhomes, they sought to flee when it was too late. These victims of the\r\neruption were not found together, and they do not appear to have\r\nbelonged to the same family or household. The most interesting of the\r\ncasts is that of two women, probably mother and daughter, lying feet to\r\nfeet; they appear from their garb to have been people of poor condition.\r\nThe elder seems to lie tranquilly on her side, overcome by the noxious\r\ngases. She probably fell and died without a struggle. Her limbs are\r\nextended, and her left arm drops loosely. On one finger is still seen\r\nher coarse iron ring. Her child was a girl of fifteen; she seems,\r\npoor thing, to have struggled hard for life. Her legs are drawn up\r\nconvulsively. Her little hands are clenched in agony. In one she holds\r\nher veil, or part of her dress with which she had covered her head,\r\nburying her face in her arms to shield herself from the falling ashes\r\nand from the foul, sulphurous smoke. The form of her head is perfectly\r\npreserved. The texture of her coarse linen garments may be traced, and\r\neven the fashion of her dress, with its long sleeves reaching to her\r\nwrists. Here and there it is torn, and the smooth young skin appears in\r\nthe plaster like polished marble. On her tiny feet may still be seen her\r\nembroidered sandals. At some distance from this group lay a third woman,\r\napparently about the age of twenty-five, and belonging to a better\r\nclass. Silver rings were on her fingers. She lay on her side, and had\r\ndied in great agony. Her garments had been gathered up on one side,\r\nleaving exposed a limb of the most beautiful form. She had fled with her\r\nlittle treasure, two silver cups, a few jewels, and some silver coins,\r\nand her keys, like a careful matron. The fourth cast is that of a man of\r\nthe people, perhaps a common soldier. He is almost of colossal size. He\r\nlies on his back, his arms extended by his side, and his feet stretched\r\nout, as if, finding escape impossible, he had laid himself down to meet\r\ndeath like a brave man. His dress consists of a short coat or jerkin,\r\nand tight-fitting breeches of some coarse stuff, perhaps leather; heavy\r\nsandals, with soles studded with nails, are laced tightly round his\r\nankles. On one finger is seen his iron ring. His features are strongly\r\nmarked, his mouth open, as in death. Some of his teeth still remain, and\r\neven part of the moustache adheres to the plaster.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the description of the plaster casts; and the photographs which\r\nI possess of those casts convey to the mind at one glance all that is\r\nthere written. Wonderful photography! How eloquent in their silence are\r\nthy pictures! To what more dignified and sublime uses could any art be\r\nput? Only a few can look upon those casts of the dead Pompeiians in the\r\nMuseum of Naples, but the whole world may view the photographs taken\r\nfrom them, and look upon the Pompeiians in their forms and habits as\r\nthey died, and read a page from the unwritten histories of those\r\nterrible death-struggles, when the strong man, the tender, placid\r\nmother, and the young and delicate maiden were all entombed in that\r\nfearful sea of mud, amidst darkness and horrors that can never be\r\nadequately described.\r\n\r\nSuch an awful catastrophe will never cease to interest the student of\r\nancient history, and photography will now be the means of deepening his\r\ninterest, and revealing to his mind with greater force and lucidity many\r\nscenes that actually occurred at the very moment of the appalling\r\ndestruction of Pompeii, on the 24th of August, A.D. 79.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE MODE OF INTENSIFYING NEGATIVES.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the best possible practice of photography is that which\r\nrequires no after intensification in the production of a first-class\r\nnegative. This, however, though a \"consummation devoutly to be wished,\"\r\nis not always attained, even by the most experienced photographer. Every\r\noperator knows that there is sometimes a condition of things that\r\nrenders a simple and efficient process of intensifying afterwards\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nOf all the modes of intensifying--and their name is legion--I think the\r\nreadiest and most generally useful has been much neglected. The\r\npersulphate of uranium and ferridcyanide of potassium process gave\r\nwonderfully charming results. But what of that? It was completely\r\nimpracticable, and a failure, in consequence of its tendency to go on\r\nincreasing in intensity in the hands of the printer.\r\n\r\nThe bichloride of mercury and iodine processes, unlimited in number,\r\nalso went on increasing in an unlimited degree, and no amount of\r\n\"roasting\" could reduce the negatives so treated to the desirable degree\r\nof transparency that would enable any printer to obtain good\r\nimpressions. There is, however, one of the bichloride of mercury\r\nprocesses, published some years ago, which I modified so as to give the\r\nmost satisfactory results. It rendered the negative sufficiently\r\nintense, and preserved the most exquisite modelling, without changing\r\nafterwards; but the process was very troublesome, and not very\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nThe simplest, cheapest, and most reliable process of intensifying\r\nnegatives that I know of is with sulphuret of potassium (liver of\r\nsulphur) used in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nMake a very dilute solution of sulphuret of potassium, put it into any\r\nold gutta-percha or porcelain bath; and, after the negative is developed\r\nas far as is desirable with the ordinary iron developer, fixed, and\r\nwashed in the usual way, immerse the plate in that state at once into\r\nthe solution of sulphuret of potassium, in the same manner as in\r\nsensitising the plate in the nitrate bath, by using a dipper, and leave\r\nit there until sufficiently intense, which is generally in about the\r\ntime required for coating and sensitising another plate, so that, if the\r\noperator be working single-handed, very little, if any, time is lost in\r\nthe process of intensifying.\r\n\r\nThe solution may also be flooded over the plate in the same manner as\r\nthe developer, after fixing and washing as before.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficiently intense, rinse the plate with water, dry, and varnish\r\nin the ordinary way. But it is best to use the intensifier in the manner\r\nfirst described, which is by far the most cleanly and economical plan,\r\nboth in the saving of time and solution. By using it with the \"bath and\r\ndipper,\" it is not offensive, on account of its extreme dilution, and\r\nnot being disturbed so much, or immediately under the olfactory nerves\r\nof the operator, it may be worked in the ordinary dark room with the\r\ngreatest safety and convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STRING OF OLD BEADS.\r\n\r\nHe is a rash man who announces \"something new\" in these days. I believe\r\nthere is nothing new under the sun, and in photography especially. If\r\nany man be rash enough to rush into print with what he considers a new\r\nidea, some other man rushes into print also and says the idea is old,\r\nexploded, useless, worthless, or worse.\r\n\r\nI lay no claim to originality. I have lived so long in the atmosphere of\r\nphotography, I don't know where or how I picked up my knowledge--such as\r\nit is. Some of it I may have stumbled on, some of it I may have found,\r\nand some of it I may have stolen. If the latter, I forget from whom,\r\nwhen, or where, and in all such cases a bad memory is a good and\r\nconvenient thing. But I will endeavour to atone for such sins by\r\npublicly restoring all I may have filched from other men's brains for\r\nthe benefit of all whom it may concern. I shall not count the beads;\r\nthat would be like running over a rosary, and I object to sub rosa\r\nrevelations; neither shall I attend to the order of stringing the beads,\r\nbut will put them on record just as they come to hand; and the first\r\nis--\r\n\r\n_How to Make Vignette Papers._--Take a piece of sensitised paper, lay it\r\nunder a piece of glass and let it blacken. Then take a camels'-hair\r\npencil dipped in a weak solution of cyanide of potassium, and paint the\r\nextreme size and shape of the desired aperture. Let it dry, and with a\r\nlittle stronger solution of cyanide paint _within_ the size and shape,\r\nand then with a stronger solution paint the centre, which will be\r\nperfectly white and semi-transparent. The object of using the three\r\nstrengths of solution and painting three separate times is to obtain\r\ngradation, and the edges will be yellow and softened like a vignette\r\nglass. These vignette papers can be attached to the back of the negative\r\nor to the outside of the printing-press, and can be used either in shade\r\nor sunshine without materially prolonging the time of printing. The\r\ncost of production is trifling, as any waste piece of paper and spare\r\ntime can be employed in making them, and they do not occupy much time in\r\nmaking; in fact, one can be made in less time than will be spent in\r\nreading this description. I need not expatiate on the advantages of\r\nbeing able to make a special vignette quickly. Every photographer must\r\nhave experienced the difficulty of purchasing a special size and shape\r\nto suit a particular subject.\r\n\r\n_How to Point a Pencil._--Rub the pencil to a point in the groove of a\r\ncorundum file. This is a better and cheaper pointer than a Yankee\r\npencil-sharpener, and it puts a finer point to a blacklead pencil than\r\nanything else I know. Retouchers, try it.\r\n\r\n_How to Ease a Tight Stopper._--There is nothing more annoying in the\r\npractice of photography than to take up a bottle and find the stopper\r\n_fixed_. In many instances the bottle is broken and time wasted in\r\ntrying to remove the fixed stopper. When such an obstinate stopper gets\r\ninto your hands, run a little glycerine round the top of the bottle. Set\r\nthe bottle down, and in a few minutes the stopper will be free.\r\nPrevention is better than cure. Keep a little glycerine on all your\r\nstoppers. Glycerine agrees with every chemical in photographic use, and\r\nprevents stoppers and bottles coming to grief. In a thousand and one\r\nways a little glycerine is beyond all price.\r\n\r\n_How to Prepare Albumenized Prints for Colouring._--Pour over them a\r\nlittle matt varnish. This removes the greasiness, and gives a fine tooth\r\nand ivory-like surface for the artist to work upon.\r\n\r\n_How to Remove Silver Stains from the White Ground of a\r\nVignette._--Touch it with a solution of cyanide of potassium, and wash\r\noff immediately. The other parts of the picture will not be injured.\r\n\r\n_How to Stipple a Window White or Yellow._--For white, mix a little\r\ndextrine and kaolin in water. Dab the mixture on the glass with a piece\r\nof cotton. For the purpose of obscuration that is quite enough; but if\r\nsightliness be essential, finish by stippling with the ends of a\r\nhog's-hair brush. For yellow, mix a little dextrine and deep orange\r\nchrome in powder together in water, and apply it to the window in the\r\nsame manner. Dabbing once or twice with a piece of cotton will exclude\r\nwhite light and make a luminous dark room. The same mixture makes an\r\nexcellent backing for dry plates to prevent halation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHTS AND LIGHTING.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been written and said about lights and lighting--a\r\ngreat deal too much; yet more must be said and written.\r\n\r\nLight is to the photographer what the sickle is to the shearer--a good\r\nreaper can cut well with an indifferent sickle, but an indifferent\r\nreaper never gets a good sickle in his hand. A good photographer, who\r\nalso understands light and shade, can produce good pictures in an\r\nordinary studio. It is the indifferent photographer who runs after\r\n\"fancy lights,\" and is, like a benighted traveller in pursuit of a\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp, eventually left floundering in a bog. It is folly to\r\nconstruct powerful concentrators if powerful reflectors have to be\r\nemployed to counteract their defects. If a limited amount of diffused\r\nlight be absolutely necessary it is best to retain it and use it in its\r\nsimplest and least expensive form.\r\n\r\nWhen I commenced photography glass houses were scarcer in England than\r\ncomets in the heavens, and the few that were in existence were all\r\nconstructed on false principles. It was not until I visited America that\r\nI saw a _properly_-constructed studio. The Americans were, and are,\r\nprone to give stupid names to sensible things; and the names they gave\r\nto their studios were no exceptions. This, that, and the other\r\nphotographer advertised his \"mammoth skylight.\" I went to sit, see, and\r\nbe satisfied that their mode of lighting was very superior to ours. I\r\nwas convinced _instanter_ that the perpendicular sides and sloping\r\nroofs of our miserable little hothouses were mistakes and things to be\r\nabhorred, while their spacious rooms and \"mammoth skylights\" were things\r\nto be admired and adopted.\r\n\r\nIn one of these rooms, and almost without blinds or reflectors, the\r\nsitter could be \"worked\" on a semi-circle or half oval, and \"lighted\"\r\neither in front or on either side at pleasure, and with the greatest\r\nfacility. I determined, there and then, to build my next studio on\r\nsimilar principles; but until recently I have had no opportunity of\r\ncarrying out my intentions. To get what I required and to make the best\r\nof my situation I had to \"fence and fiddle\" the district surveyor: but I\r\ngained my point, and the victory was worth the foils and the\r\nfiddlestick.\r\n\r\nMy studio can be lighted from either side; but the \"light of lights\" is\r\nthe north one, and that is a large fixed window 11 by 9 feet with a\r\nsingle slope of two and a half feet in the height; that is, two and\r\na half feet out of the perpendicular at the top, with no other top light\r\nand no perpendicular side light. With this light I do all ordinary work.\r\nI can work round the light from one side of the room to the other, as\r\nunder a mammoth skylight, without using either blind or reflector. If I\r\nwant Rembrandt effects I have only to open a shutter on the south side,\r\nand let in subdued sunlight. That at once becomes the dominant light,\r\nand the north light illumines the shadows. The bottom of the north light\r\nis three feet from the floor.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this form of studio are these. It is cool, because no\r\nmore light is admitted than is absolutely necessary. It is neat, because\r\nno rag-like curtains are hanging about. It is clean, because there is\r\nnothing to collect dirt. It is dry, because the pitch of the roof\r\nrenders leakage impossible. It is pleasant to the sitter, because of\r\nthese desirabilities, and that the light is not distressing. It is\r\nagreeable to the operator, because the work is easy and everything is\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted by Piper & Carter, 5, Furnival Street, Holborn, London, E.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVEN NEW SIZES,\r\n\r\nALL WITH\r\n\r\nTRANSPARENT\r\n\r\nFILM.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Kodak Film Camera]\r\n\r\nNo apparatus connected with Photography has ever excited so much\r\ninterest as\r\n\r\nTHE KODAK.\r\n\r\nThe No. 1, making a round picture, was only the entering wedge, and\r\nserved its purpose admirably, in introducing to the public the vast\r\nadvantages of a Camera using films over any form of Camera using glass.\r\n\r\nThis year we beg to call your attention to SEVEN NEW\r\nSIZES, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  No. 2,     3-1/2 inch Circular Picture, one finder.\r\n  No. 3,     Regular, 3-1/4 x 4-1/4, Square Picture, two finders.\r\n  No. 3,     Junior,        \"\r\n  No, 4,     Regular, 4 x 5,\r\n  No. 4,     Junior,    \"\r\n  No. 4,     Folding,   \"\r\n  No. 5,       \"      5 x 7,           \"      \"             \"\r\n\r\n_Send for the New KODAK PRIMER, fully describing all sizes and styles._\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE EASTMAN PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIALS COMPANY, Limited,\r\n  115, Oxford Street, London, W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT IS ADMITTED by Every Competent Authority THAT WRATTEN'S 'LONDON'\r\nPLATES ARE THE UNIVERSAL STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE AND COMPARISON.\r\n\r\nThis high reputation has been sustained against a host of competitors\r\nfor twelve years:--a fact without parallel in the annals of the Gelatine\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs.

The spelling of French\r\nwords has been made consistent. Also made consistent were those words\r\nwhich appear as hyphenated, joined or as two individual words (for\r\nexample, first class to first-class and some one to someone). Other\r\ncorrections were made where inconsistent or incorrect spellings were\r\nused in the publication. Where the inconsistencies occur in publication\r\ntitles or quoted text passages, they were left as published.\r\n\r\nAll \"oe\" ligatures in the printed text were converted to the letters\r\n\"oe\".\r\n\r\nSome of the entries in the INDEX appear to be missorted alphabetically.\r\nThey were left as printed.\r\n\r\nOn page 114, one line ends with \"modifica-\" and it is assumed \"tion\"\r\nwas left off the next line.\r\n\r\nTypographical Corrections\r\n\r\n  Page   Correction\r\n  ====   =======================\r\n   114   modifica- => modification\r\n   131   Willat's => Willats's\r\n   134   intotroduced => introduced\r\n   163   Frith => Firth\r\n   177   Coxackie => Coxsackie\r\n   186   Pearce => Pierce\r\n   248   Nicolas Maas => Nicolaes Maes",
