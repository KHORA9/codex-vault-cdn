He is called upon to exercise a choice, and his\r\ndilemma is by no means made the easier owing to the fact he is acutely\r\nconscious that whichever way he may decide he is laying himself open to\r\ndamaging and not impertinent criticism. Since it is essential that his\r\nwork should be comprised within a reasonable compass he may elect to\r\nattempt a bird’s-eye view of the whole range from China to Peru, from the\r\nhalf-articulate, rhythmic incantations of primitive man at the dawn of\r\nlife to the last spiritistic fad and manifestation at yesterday’s séance\r\nor circle, in which case his pages will most certainly be thin and often\r\nsuperficial: or again he may rather concentrate upon one or two features\r\nin the history of Witchcraft, deal with these at some length, stress some\r\nfew forgotten facts whose importance is now neglected and unrealized,\r\nutilize new material the result of laborious research, but all this at\r\nthe expense of inevitable omissions, of hiatus, of self-denial, the\r\navoidance of fascinating by-ways and valuable inquiry, of silence when he\r\nwould fain be entering upon discussion and exposition. With a full sense\r\nof its drawbacks and danger I have selected the second method, since in\r\ndealing with a topic such as Witchcraft where there is no human hope of\r\nrecording more than a tithe of the facts I believe it is better to give\r\na documented account of certain aspects rather than to essay a somewhat\r\nhuddled and confused conspectus of the whole, for such, indeed, even at\r\nbest is itself bound to have no inconsiderable gaps and lacunæ, however\r\ncarefully we endeavour to make it complete. I am conscious, then, that\r\nthere is scarcely a paragraph in the present work which might not easily\r\nbe expanded into a page, scarcely a page which might not to its great\r\nadvantage become a chapter, and certainly not a chapter that would not be\r\nvastly improved were it elaborated to a volume.\r\n\r\nMany omissions are, as I have said, a necessary consequence of the plan I\r\nhave adopted; or, indeed, I venture to suppose, of any other plan which\r\ncontemplates the treatment of so universal a subject as Witchcraft. I\r\ncan but offer my apologies to these students who come to this History to\r\nfind details of Finnish magic and the sorceries of Lapland, who wish to\r\ninform themselves concerning Tohungaism among the Maoris, Hindu devilry\r\nand enchantments, the Bersekir of Iceland, Siberian Shamanism, the blind\r\nPan Sus and Mutangs of Korea, the Chinese Wu-po, Serbian lycanthropy,\r\nnegro Voodoism, the dark lore of old Scandinavia and Islam. I trust my\r\nreaders will believe that I regret as much as any the absence of these\r\nfrom my work, but after all in any human endeavour there are practical\r\nlimitations of space.\r\n\r\nIn a complementary and companion volume I am intending to treat the\r\nepidemic of Witchcraft in particular localities, the British Isles,\r\nFrance, Germany, Italy, New England, and other countries. Many famous\r\ncases, the Lancashire witch-trials, the activities of Matthew Hopkins,\r\nGilles de Rais, Gaufridi, Urbain Grandier, Cotton Mather and the Salem\r\nsorceries, will then be dealt with and discussed in some detail.\r\n\r\nIt is a surprising fact that amongst English writers Witchcraft in\r\nEurope has not of recent years received anything like adequate attention\r\nfrom serious students of history, who strangely fail to recognize the\r\nimportance of this tragic belief both as a political and a social factor.\r\nMagic, the genesis of magical cults and ceremonies, the ritual of\r\nprimitive peoples, traditional superstitions, and their ancillary lore,\r\nhave been made the subject of vast and erudite studies, mostly from an\r\nanthropological and folk-loristic point of view, but the darker side of\r\nthe subject, the history of Satanism, seems hardly to have been attempted.\r\n\r\nPossibly one reason for this neglect and ignorance lies in the fact that\r\nthe heavy and crass materialism, which was so prominent a feature during\r\nthe greater part of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in England,\r\nintellectually disavowed the supernatural, and attempted not without\r\nsome success to substitute for religion a stolid system of respectable\r\nmorality. Since Witchcraft was entirely exploded it would, at best,\r\npossess merely an antiquarian interest, and even so, the exhumation of\r\na disgusting and contemptible superstition was not to be encouraged.\r\nIt were more seemly to forget the uglier side of the past. This was\r\nthe attitude which prevailed for more than a hundred and fifty years,\r\nand when Witchcraft came under discussion by such narrowly prejudiced\r\nand inefficient writers as Lecky or Charles Mackay they are not even\r\nconcerned to discuss the possibility of the accounts given by the earlier\r\nauthorities, who, as they premise, were all mistaken, extravagant,\r\npurblind, and misled. The cycle of time has had its revenge, and this\r\nrationalistic superstition is dying fast. The extraordinary vogue of\r\nand immense adherence to Spiritism would alone prove that, whilst the\r\nwidespread interest that is taken in mysticism is a yet healthier sign\r\nthat the world will no longer be content to be fed on dry husks and the\r\nchaff of straw. And these are only just two indications, and by no means\r\nthe most significant, out of many.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible to appreciate and understand the true lives of men\r\nand women in Elizabethan and Stuart England, in the France of Louis XIII\r\nand his son, in the Italy of the Renaissance and the Catholic Reaction—to\r\nname but three countries and a few definite periods—unless we have\r\nsome realization of the part that Witchcraft played in those ages amid\r\nthe affairs of these kingdoms. All classes were concerned from Pope to\r\npeasant, from Queen to cottage gill.\r\n\r\nAccordingly as actors are “the abstracts and brief chronicles of the\r\ntime” I have given a concluding chapter which deals with Witchcraft as\r\nseen upon the stage, mainly concentrating upon the English theatre.\r\nThis review has not before been attempted, and since Witchcraft was so\r\nformidable a social evil and so intermixed with all stations of life it\r\nis obvious that we can find few better contemporary illustrations of it\r\nthan in the drama, for the playwright ever had his finger upon the public\r\npulse. Until the development of the novel it was the theatre alone that\r\nmirrored manners and history.\r\n\r\nThere are many general French studies of Witchcraft of the greatest\r\nvalue, amongst which we may name such standard works as Antoine-Louis\r\nDaugis, _Traité sur la magie, le sortilège, les possessions,\r\nobsessions et maléfices_, 1732; Jules Garinet, _Histoire de la Magie\r\nen France depuis le commencement de la monarchie jusqu’à nos jours_,\r\n1818; Michelet’s famous _La Sorcière_; Alfred Maury, _La Magie et\r\nl’Astrologie_, 3rd edition, 1868; L’Abbé Lecanu, _Histoire de Satan_;\r\nJules Baissac, _Les grands Jours de la Sorcellerie_, 1890; Theodore de\r\nCauzons, _La Magie et la Sorcellerie en France_, 4 vols., 1910, etc.\r\n\r\nIn German we have Eberhard Hauber’s _Bibliotheca Magica_; Roskoff’s\r\n_Geschichte des Teufels_, 1869; Soldan’s _Geschichte der Hexenprozesse_\r\n(neu bearbeitet von Dr. Heinrich Heppe), 1880; Friedrich Leitschuch’s\r\n_Beitræge zur Geschichte des Hexenwesens in Franken_, 1883; Johan\r\nDieffenbach’s _Der Hexenwahn vor und nach der Glaubensspaltung in\r\nDeutschland_, 1886; Schreiber’s _Die Hexenprozesse im Breisgau_; Ludwig\r\nRapp’s _Die Hexenprozesse und ihre Gegner aus Tirol_; Joseph Hansen’s\r\n_Quellen und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Hexenwahns_, 1901; and\r\nvery many more admirably documented studies.\r\n\r\nIn England the best of the older books must be recommended with necessary\r\nreservations. Thomas Wright’s _Narratives of Sorcery and Magic_, 2 vols.,\r\n1851, is to be commended as the work of a learned antiquarian who often\r\nreferred to original sources, but it is withal sketchy and can hardly\r\nsatisfy the careful scholar. Some exceptionally good writing and sound,\r\nclear, thinking are to be met with in Dr. F. G. Lee’s _The Other World_,\r\n2 vols., 1875; _More Glimpses of the World Unseen_, 1878; _Glimpses in\r\nthe Twilight_, 1885; and _Sight and Shadows_, 1894, all of which deserve\r\nto be far more widely known, since they well repay an unhurried and\r\nrepeated perusal.\r\n\r\nQuite recent work is represented by Professor Wallace Notestein’s\r\n_History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718_, published in\r\n1911. This intimate study of a century and a half concentrates, as its\r\ntitle tells, upon England alone. It is supplied with ample and useful\r\nappendixes. In respect of the orderly marshalling of his facts, garnered\r\nfrom the trials and other sources—no small labour—Professor Notestein\r\ndeserves a generous meed of praise; his interpretation of the facts and\r\nhis deductions may not unfairly be criticized. Although his incredulity\r\nmust surely now and again be shaken by the cumulative force of reiterated\r\nand corroborative evidence, nevertheless he refuses to admit even the\r\npossibility that persons who at any rate affected supernatural powers\r\nheld clandestine meetings after nightfall in obscure and lonely places\r\nfor purposes and plots of their own. If human testimony is worth\r\nanything at all, unless we are to be more Pyrrhonian than the famous\r\nDr. Marphurius himself who would never say, “Je suis venu; mais; Il me\r\nsemble que je suis venu,” when in 1612 Roger Nowell had swooped down on\r\nthe Lancashire coven and carried off Elizabeth Demdike with three other\r\nbeldames to durance vile in Lancaster Castle, Elizabeth Device summoned\r\nthe whole Pendle gang to her home at Malking Tower, in order that they\r\nmight discuss the situation and contrive the delivery of the prisoners.\r\nAs soon as they had forgathered, they all sat down to dinner, and had\r\na good north country spread of beef, bacon, and roast mutton. Surely\r\nthere is nothing very remarkable in this; and the evidence as given in\r\nThomas Potts’ famous narrative, _The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches\r\nin the countie of Lancaster_ (London, 1613), bears the very hall-mark\r\nand impress of truth: “The persons aforesaid had to their dinners Beefe,\r\nBacon, and roasted Mutton; which Mutton (as this Examinates said brother\r\nsaid) was of a Wether of Christopher Swyers of Barley: which Wether was\r\nbrought in the night before into this Examinates mothers house by the\r\nsaid Iames Deuice, the Examinates said brother: and in this Examinates\r\nsight killed and eaten.” But Professor Notestein will none of it. He\r\nwrites: “The concurring evidence in the Malking Tower story is of no\r\nmore compelling character than that to be found in a multitude of\r\nContinental stories of witch gatherings which have been shown to be the\r\noutcome of physical or mental pressure and of leading questions. It seems\r\nunnecessary to accept even a substratum of fact” (p. 124). In the face\r\nof such sweeping and dogmatic assertion mere evidence is no use at all.\r\nFor we know that the Continental stories of witch gatherings are with\r\nvery few exceptions the chronicle of actual fact. It must be confessed\r\nthat such feeble scepticism, which repeatedly mars his summary of the\r\nwitch-trials, is a serious blemish in Professor Notestein’s work, and in\r\nview of his industry much to be regretted.\r\n\r\nMiss M. A. Murray does not for a moment countenance any such summary\r\ndismissal and uncritical rejection of evidence. Her careful reading\r\nof the writers upon Witchcraft has justly convinced her that their\r\nstatements must be accepted. Keen intelligences and shrewd investigators\r\nsuch as Gregory XV, Bodin, Guazzo, De Lancre, D’Espagnet, La Reynie,\r\nBoyle, Sir Matthew Hale, Glanvill, were neither deceivers nor deceived.\r\nThe evidence must stand, but as Miss Murray finds herself unable to\r\nadmit the logical consequence of this, she hurriedly starts away with\r\nan arbitrary, “the statements do not bear the construction put upon\r\nthem,” and in _The Witch-Cult in Western Europe_ (1921) proceeds to\r\ndevelop a most ingenious, but, as I show, a wholly untenable hypothesis.\r\nAccordingly we are not surprised to find that many of the details\r\nMiss Murray has collected in her painstaking pages are (no doubt\r\nunconsciously) made to square with her preconceived theory. However much\r\nI may differ from Miss Murray in my outlook, and our disagreement is, I\r\nconsider, neither slight nor superficial, I am none the less bound to\r\ncommend her frank and courageous treatment of many essential particulars\r\nwhich are all too often suppressed, and in consequence a false and\r\ncounterfeit picture has not unseldom been drawn.\r\n\r\nSo vast a literature surrounds modern Witchcraft, for frankly such is\r\nSpiritism in effect, that it were no easy task to mention even a quota\r\nof those works which seem to throw some real light upon a complex and\r\ndifficult subject. Among many which I have found useful are Surbled,\r\n_Spiritualisme et spiritisme_ and _Spirites et médiums_; Gutberlet,\r\n_Der Kampf um die Seele_; Dr. Marcel Viollet, _Le spiritisme dans ses\r\nrapports avec la folie_; J. Godfrey Raupert, _Modern Spiritism_ and\r\n_Dangers of Spiritualism_; the Very Rev. Alexis Lépicier, O.S.M., _The\r\nUnseen World_; the Rev. A. V. Miller, _Sermons on Modern Spiritualism_;\r\nLapponi, _Hypnotism and Spiritism_; the late Monsignor Hugh Benson’s\r\n_Spiritualism_ (_The History of Religions_); Elliot O’Donnell’s _The\r\nMenace of Spiritualism_; and Father Simon Blackmore’s _Spiritism: Facts\r\nand Frauds_, 1925. My own opinion of this movement has been formed not\r\nonly from reading studies and monographs which treat of every phase of\r\nthe question from all points of view, but also by correspondence and\r\ndiscussion with ardent devotees of the cult, and, not least, owing to\r\nthe admissions and warnings of those who have abandoned these dangerous\r\npractices, revelations made in such circumstances, however, as altogether\r\nto preclude even a hint as to their definite import and scope.\r\n\r\nThe History of Witchcraft is full of interest to the theologian, the\r\npsychologist, the historian, and cannot be ignored. But it presents a\r\nvery dark and terrible aspect, the details of which in the few English\r\nstudies that claim serious attention have almost universally been\r\nunrecorded, and, indeed, deliberately burked and shunned. Such treatment\r\nis unworthy and unscholarly to a degree, reprehensible and dishonest.\r\n\r\nThe work of Professor Notestein, for example, is gravely vitiated,\r\nowing to the fact that he has completely ignored the immodesty of the\r\nwitch-cult and thus extenuated its evil. He is, indeed, so uncritical, I\r\nwould even venture to say so unscholarly, as naïvely to remark (p. 300):\r\n“No one who has not read for himself can have any notion of the vile\r\ncharacter of the charges and confessions embodied in the witch pamphlets.\r\nIt is an aspect of the question which has not been discussed in these\r\npages.” Such a confession is amazing. One cannot write in dainty phrase\r\nof Satanists and the Sabbat. However loathly the disease the doctor must\r\nnot hesitate to diagnose and to probe. This ostrich-like policy is moral\r\ncowardice. None of the Fathers and great writers of the Church were thus\r\nculpably prudish. When S. Epiphanius has to discuss the Gnostics, he\r\ndescribes in detail their abominations, and pertinently remarks: “Why\r\nshould I shrink from speaking of the things you do not fear to do? By\r\nspeaking thus, I hope to fill you with horror of the turpitudes you\r\ncommit.” And S. Clement of Alexandria says: “I am not ashamed to name the\r\nparts of the body wherein the fœtus is formed and nourished; and why,\r\nindeed, should I be, since God was not ashamed to create them?”\r\n\r\nA few authors have painted the mediæval witch in pretty colours on\r\nsatin. She has become a somewhat eccentric but kindly old lady, shrewd\r\nand perspicacious, with a knowledge of healing herbs and simples, ready\r\nto advise and aid her neighbours who are duller-witted than she; not\r\ndisdaining in return a rustic present of a flitch, meal, a poult or eggs\r\nfrom the farm-yard. And so for no very definite reason she fell an easy\r\nprey to fanatic judges and ravening inquisitors, notoriously the most\r\nignorant and stupid of mortals, who caught her, swum her in a river,\r\ntried her, tortured her, and finally burned her at the stake. Many modern\r\nwriters, more sceptical still, frankly relegate the witch to the land of\r\nnursery tales and Christmas pantomime; she never had any real existence\r\nother than as Cinderella’s fairy godmother or the Countess D’Aulnoy’s\r\nMadame Merluche.\r\n\r\nI have even heard it publicly asserted from the lecture platform by\r\na professed student of the Elizabethan period that the Elizabethans\r\ndid not, of course, as a matter of fact believe in Witchcraft. It\r\nwere impossible to imagine that men of the intellectual standard of\r\nShakespeare, Ford, Jonson, Fletcher, could have held so idle a chimæra,\r\nborn of sick fancies and hysteria. And his audience acquiesced with no\r\nlittle complacency, pleased to think that the great names of the past had\r\nbeen cleared from the stigma of so degrading and gross a superstition. A\r\nfew uneducated peasants here and there may have been morbid and ignorant\r\nenough to dream of witches, and the poets used these crones and hags with\r\neffect in ballad and play. But as for giving any actual credence to such\r\nfantasies, most assuredly our great Elizabethans were more enlightened\r\nthan that! And, indeed, Witchcraft is a phase of and a factor in the\r\nmanners of the seventeenth century, which in some quarters there seems a\r\ntacit agreement almost to ignore.\r\n\r\nAll this is very unhistorical and very unscientific. In the following\r\npages I have endeavoured to show the witch as she really was—an evil\r\nliver; a social pest and parasite; the devotee of a loathly and obscene\r\ncreed; an adept at poisoning, blackmail, and other creeping crimes; a\r\nmember of a powerful secret organization inimical to Church and State;\r\na blasphemer in word and deed; swaying the villagers by terror and\r\nsuperstition; a charlatan and a quack sometimes; a bawd; an abortionist;\r\nthe dark counsellor of lewd court ladies and adulterous gallants; a\r\nminister to vice and inconceivable corruption; battening upon the filth\r\nand foulest passions of the age.\r\n\r\nMy present work is the result of more than thirty years’ close attention\r\nto the subject of Witchcraft, and during this period I have made a\r\nsystematic and intensive study of the older demonologists, as I am\r\nconvinced that their first-hand evidence is of prime importance and\r\nvalue, whilst since their writings are very voluminous and of the\r\nlast rarity they have universally been neglected, and are allowed to\r\naccumulate thick dust undisturbed. They are, moreover, often difficult\r\nto read owing to technicalities of phrase and vocabulary. Among the most\r\nauthoritative I may cite a few names: Sprenger (_Malleus Maleficarum_);\r\nGuazzo; Bartolomeo Spina, O.P.; John Nider, O.P.; Grilland; Jerome\r\nMengo; Binsfeld; Gerson; Ulrich Molitor; Basin; Murner; Crespet; Anania;\r\nHenri Boguet; Bodin; Martin Delrio, S.J.; Pierre le Loyer; Ludwig Elich;\r\nGodelmann; Nicolas Remy; Salerini; Leonard Vair; De Lancre; Alfonso de\r\nCastro; Sebastian Michaelis, O.P.; Sinistrari; Perreaud; Dom Calmet;\r\nSylvester Mazzolini, O.P. (Prierias). When we supplement these by the\r\njudicial records and the legal codes we have an immense body of material.\r\nIn all that I have written I have gone to original sources, and it has\r\nbeen my endeavour fairly to weigh and balance the evidence, to judge\r\nwithout heat or prejudice, to give the facts and the comment upon them\r\nwith candour, sincerity, and truth. At the same time I am very well aware\r\nthat several great scholars for whom I have the sincerest personal regard\r\nand whose attainments I view with a very profound respect will differ\r\nfrom me in many particulars.\r\n\r\nI am conscious that the rough list of books which I have drawn up does\r\nnot deserve to be dignified with the title, Bibliography. It is sadly\r\nincomplete, yet should it, however inadequate, prove helpful in the\r\nsmallest way it will have justified its inclusion. I may add that my\r\nBiblical quotations, save where expressly otherwise noted, are from the\r\nVulgate or its translation into English commonly called the Douai Version.\r\n\r\n    IN FESTO S. TERESEIÆ, _V._\r\n    1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF WITCHCRAFT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE WITCH: HERETIC AND ANARCHIST\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sorcier est celuy qui par moyens Diaboliques sciemment s’efforce\r\nde paruenir a quel que chose.” (“A sorcerer is one who by commerce\r\nwith the Devil has a full intention of attaining his own ends.”) With\r\nthese words the profoundly erudite jurisconsult Jean Bodin, one of\r\nthe acutest and most strictly impartial minds of his age, opens his\r\nfamous _De la Demonomanie des Sorciers_,[1] and it would be, I imagine,\r\nhardly possible to discover a more concise, exact, comprehensive, and\r\nintelligent definition of a Witch. The whole tremendous subject of\r\nWitchcraft, especially as revealed in its multifold and remarkable\r\nmanifestations throughout every district of Southern and Western Europe\r\nfrom the middle of the thirteenth until the dawn of the eighteenth\r\ncentury,[2] has it would seem in recent times seldom, if ever, been\r\ncandidly and fairly examined. The only sound sources of information are\r\nthe contemporary records; the meticulously detailed legal reports of\r\nthe actual trials; the vast mass of pamphlets which give eye-witnessed\r\naccounts of individual witches and reproduce evidence _uerbatim_ as\r\ntold in court; and, above all, the voluminous and highly technical\r\nworks of the Inquisitors and demonologists, holy and reverend divines,\r\ndoctors _utriusque iuris_, hard-headed, slow, and sober lawyers,—learned\r\nmen, scholars of philosophic mind, the most honourable names in the\r\nuniversities of Europe, in the forefront of literature, science,\r\npolitics, and culture; monks who kept the conscience of kings, pontiffs;\r\nwhose word would set Europe aflame and bring an emperor to his knees at\r\ntheir gate.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Witchcraft has formed the subject of a not inconsiderable\r\nliterature, but it will be found that inquirers have for the most\r\npart approached this eternal and terrible chapter in the history of\r\nhumanity from biassed, although wholly divergent, points of view, and\r\nin consequence it is often necessary to sift more or less thoroughly\r\ntheir partial presentation of their theme, to discount their unwarranted\r\ncommentaries and illogical conclusions, and to get down in time to the\r\nhard bed-rock of fact.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we have those writings and that interest which may be\r\ntermed merely antiquarian. Witchcraft is treated as a curious by-lane\r\nof history, a superstition long since dead, having no existence among,\r\nnor bearing upon, the affairs of the present day. It is a field for\r\nfolk-lore, where one may gather strange flowers and noxious weeds. Again,\r\nwe often recognize the romantic treatment of Witchcraft. ’Tis the Eve\r\nof S. George, a dark wild night, the pale moon can but struggle thinly\r\nthrough the thick massing clouds. The witches are abroad, and hurtle\r\nswiftly aloft, a hideous covey, borne headlong on the skirling blast. In\r\ndelirious tones they are yelling foul mysterious words as they go: “Har!\r\nHar! Har! Altri! Altri!” To some peak of the Brocken or lonely Cevennes\r\nthey haste, to the orgies of the Sabbat, the infernal Sacraments, the\r\ndance of Acheron, the sweet and fearful fantasy of evil, “Vers les\r\nstupres impurs et les baisers immondes.”[3] Hell seems to vomit its\r\nfoulest dregs upon the shrinking earth; a loathsome shape of obscene\r\nhorror squats huge and monstrous upon the ebon throne; the stifling air\r\nreeks with filth and blasphemy; faster and faster whirls the witches’\r\nlewd lavolta; shriller and shriller the cornemuse screams; and then a\r\nwan grey light flickers in the Eastern sky; a moment more and there\r\nsounds the loud clarion of some village chanticleer; swift as thought the\r\nvile phantasmagoria vanishes and is sped, all is quiet and still in the\r\npeaceful dawn.\r\n\r\nBut both the antiquarian and the romanticist reviews of Witchcraft may\r\nbe deemed negligible and impertinent so far as the present research is\r\nconcerned, however entertaining and picturesque such treatment proves to\r\nmany readers, affording not a few pleasant hours, whence they are able\r\nto draw highly dramatic and brilliantly coloured pictures of old time\r\nsorceries, not to be taken too seriously, for these things never were and\r\nnever could have been.[4]\r\n\r\nThe rationalist historian and the sceptic, when inevitably confronted\r\nwith the subject of Witchcraft, chose a charmingly easy way to deal with\r\nthese intensely complex and intricate problems, a flat denial of all\r\nstatements which did not fit, or could not by some means be squared with,\r\ntheir own narrow prejudice. What matter the most irrefragable evidence,\r\nwhich in the instance of any other accusation would unhesitatingly have\r\nbeen regarded as final. What matter the logical and reasoned belief of\r\ncenturies, of the most cultured peoples, the highest intelligences of\r\nEurope? Any appeal to authority is, of course, useless, as the sceptic\r\nrepudiates all authority—save his own. Such things could not be. We must\r\nargue from that axiom, and therefore anything which it is impossible\r\nto explain away by hallucination, or hysteria, or auto-suggestion,\r\nor any other vague catch-word which may chance to be fashionable at\r\nthe moment, must be uncompromisingly rejected, and a note of superior\r\npity, to candy the so suave yet crushingly decisive judgement, has\r\nproved of great service upon more occasions than one. Why examine the\r\nevidence? It is really useless and a waste of time, because we know that\r\nthe allegations are all idle and ridiculous; the “facts” sworn to by\r\ninnumerable witnesses, which are repeated in changeless detail century\r\nafter century in every country, in every town, simply did not take place.\r\nHow so absolute and entire falsity of these facts can be demonstrated\r\nthe sceptic omits to inform us, but we must unquestioningly accept his\r\ninfallible authority in the face of reason, evidence, and truth.\r\n\r\nYet supposing that with clear and candid minds we proceed carefully to\r\ninvestigate this accumulated evidence, to inquire into the circumstances\r\nof a number of typical cases, to compare the trials of the fifteenth\r\ncentury in France with the trials of the seventeenth century in England,\r\nshall we not find that amid obvious accretions of fantastic and\r\nsuperfluous detail a certain very solid substratum of a permanent and\r\ninvaried character is unmistakably to be traced throughout the whole?\r\nThis cannot in reason be denied, and here we have the core and the\r\nenduring reality of Witchcraft and the witch-cult throughout the ages.\r\n\r\nThere were some gross superstitions; there were some unbridled\r\nimaginations; there was deception, there was legerdemain; there was\r\nphantasy; there was fraud; Henri Boguet seems, perhaps, a trifle\r\ncredulous, a little eager to explain obscure practices by an instant\r\nappeal to the supernormal; Brother Jetzer, the Jacobin of Berne, can\r\nonly have been either the tool of his superiors or a cunning impostor;\r\nMatthew Hopkins was an unmitigated scoundrel who preyed upon the fears of\r\nthe Essex franklins whilst he emptied their pockets; Lord Torphichen’s\r\nson was an idle mischievous boy whose pranks not merely deluded both\r\nhis father and the Rev. Mr. John Wilkins, but caused considerable\r\nmystification and amaze throughout the whole of Calder; Anne Robinson,\r\nMrs. Golding’s maid, and the two servant lasses of Baldarroch were\r\nprestidigitators of no common sleight and skill; and all these examples\r\nof ignorance, gullibility, malice, trickery, and imposture might easily\r\nbe multiplied twenty times over and twenty times again, yet when every\r\nallowance has been made, every possible explanation exhausted, there\r\npersists a congeries of solid proven fact which cannot be ignored, save\r\nindeed by the purblind prejudice of the rationalist, and cannot be\r\naccounted for, save that we recognize there were and are individuals and\r\norganizations deliberately, nay, even enthusiastically, devoted to the\r\nservice of evil, greedy of such emotions and experiences, rewards the\r\nthraldom of wickedness may bring.\r\n\r\nThe sceptic notoriously refuses to believe in Witchcraft, but a sanely\r\ncritical examination of the evidence at the witch-trials will show that a\r\nvast amount of the modern vulgar incredulity is founded upon a complete\r\nmisconception of the facts, and it may be well worth while quite briefly\r\nto review and correct some of the more common objections that are so\r\nloosely and so repeatedly maintained. There are many points which are\r\nurged as proving the fatuous absurdity and demonstrable impossibility of\r\nthe whole system, and yet there is not one of these phenomena which is\r\nnot capable of a satisfactory, and often a simple, elucidation. Perhaps\r\nthe first thought of a witch that will occur to the man in the street\r\nis that of a hag on a broomstick flying up the chimney through the\r\nair. This has often been pictorially impressed on his imagination, not\r\nmerely by woodcuts and illustrations traditionally presented in books,\r\nbut by the brush of great painters such as Queverdo’s _Le Départ au\r\nSabbat_, _Le Départ pour le Sabbat_ of David Teniers, and Goya’s midnight\r\nfantasies. The famous Australian artist, Norman Lindsay, has a picture\r\n_To The Sabbat_[5] where witches are depicted wildly rushing through\r\nthe air on the backs of grotesque pigs and hideous goats. Shakespeare,\r\ntoo, elaborated the idea, and “Hover through the fog and filthy air”\r\nhas impressed itself upon the English imagination. But to descend from\r\nthe airy realms of painting and poetry to the hard ground of actuality.\r\nThroughout the whole of the records there are very few instances when\r\na witness definitely asserted that he had seen a witch carried through\r\nthe air mounted upon a broom or stick of any kind, and on every occasion\r\nthere is patent and obvious exaggeration to secure an effect. Sometimes\r\nthe witches themselves boasted of this means of transport to impress\r\ntheir hearers. Boguet records that Claudine Boban, a young girl whose\r\nhead was turned with pathological vanity, obviously a monomaniac who\r\nmust at all costs occupy the centre of the stage and be the cynosure of\r\npublic attention, confessed that she had been to the Sabbat, and this\r\nwas undoubtedly the case; but to walk or ride on horseback to the Sabbat\r\nwere far too ordinary methods of locomotion, melodrama and the marvellous\r\nmust find their place in her account and so she alleged: “that both she\r\nand her mother used to mount on a broom, and so making their exit by the\r\nchimney in this fashion they flew through the air to the Sabbat.”[6]\r\nJulian Cox (1664) said that one evening when she was in the fields\r\nabout a mile away from the house “there came riding towards her three\r\npersons upon three Broom-staves, born up about a yard and a half from the\r\nground.”[7] There is obvious exaggeration here; she saw two men and one\r\nwoman bestriding brooms and leaping high in the air. They were, in fact,\r\nperforming a magic rite, a figure of a dance. So it is recorded of the\r\nArab crones that “In the time of the Munkidh the witches rode about naked\r\non a stick between the graves of the cemetery of Shaizar.”[8] Nobody can\r\nrefuse to believe that the witches bestrode sticks and poles and in their\r\nritual capered to and fro in this manner, a sufficiently grotesque, but\r\nby no means an impossible, action. And this bizarre ceremony, evidence\r\nof which—with no reference to flying through the air—is frequent, has\r\nbeen exaggerated and transformed into the popular superstition that\r\nsorcerers are carried aloft and so transported from place to place, a\r\nwonder they were all ready to exploit in proof of their magic powers. And\r\nyet it is not impossible that there should have been actual instances of\r\nlevitation. For, outside the lives of the Saints, spiritistic séances\r\nafford us examples of this supernormal phenomenon, which, if human\r\nevidence is worth anything at all, are beyond all question proven.\r\n\r\nAs for the unguents wherewith the sorcerers anointed themselves we have\r\nthe actual formulæ for this composition, and Professor A. J. Clark, who\r\nhas examined these,[9] considers that it is possible a strong application\r\nof such liniments might produce unwonted excitement and even delirium.\r\nBut long ago the great demonologists recognized and laid down that of\r\nthemselves the unguents possessed no such properties as the witches\r\nsupposed. “The ointment and lotion are just of no use at all to witches\r\nto aid their journey to the Sabbat,” is the well-considered opinion\r\nof Boguet who,[10] speaking with confident precision and finality, on\r\nthis point is in entire agreement with the most sceptical of later\r\nrationalists.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of witches into animals and the extraordinary\r\nappearance at their orgies of “the Devil” under many a hideously\r\nunnatural shape, two points which have been repeatedly held up to\r\nscorn as self-evident impossibilities and proof conclusive of the\r\nuntrustworthiness of the evidence and the incredibility of the whole\r\nsystem, can both be easily and fairly interpreted in a way which offers\r\na complete and convincing explanation of these prodigies. The first\r\nmetamorphosis, indeed, is mentioned and fully explained in the _Liber\r\nPœnitentialis_[11] of S. Theodore, seventh Archbishop of Canterbury\r\n(668-690), capitulum xxvii, which code includes under the rubric _De\r\nIdolatria et Sacrilegio_ “qui in Kalendas Ianuarii in ceruulo et in\r\nuitula uadit,” and prescribes: “If anyone at the Kalends of January goes\r\nabout as a stag or a bull; that is, making himself into a wild animal\r\nand dressing in the skin of a herd animal, and putting on the heads of\r\nbeasts; those who in such wise transform themselves into the appearance\r\nof a wild animal, penance for three years because this is devilish.”\r\nThese ritual masks, furs, and hides, were, of course, exactly those the\r\nwitches at certain ceremonies were wont to don for their Sabbats. There\r\nis ample proof that “the Devil” of the Sabbat was very frequently a\r\nhuman being, the Grand Master of the district, and since his officers\r\nand immediate attendants were also termed “Devils” by the witches some\r\nconfusion has on occasion ensued. In a few cases where sufficient\r\ndetails are given it is possible actually to identify “the Devil” by\r\nname. Thus, among a list of suspected persons in the reign of Elizabeth\r\nwe have “Ould Birtles, the great devil, Roger Birtles and his wife, and\r\nAnne Birtles.”[12] The evil William, Lord Soulis, of Hermitage Castle,\r\noften known as “Red Cap,” was “the Devil” of a coven of sorcerers. Very\r\nseldom “the Devil” was a woman. In May, 1569, the Regent of Scotland was\r\npresent at S. Andrews “quhair a notabill sorceres callit Nicniven was\r\ncondemnit to the death and burnt.” Now Nicniven is the Queen of Elphin,\r\nthe Mistress of the Sabbat, and this office had evidently been filled\r\nby this witch whose real name is not recorded. On 8 November, 1576,\r\nElizabeth or Bessy Dunlop, of Lyne, in the Barony of Dalry, Ayrshire,\r\nwas tried for sorcery, and she confessed that a certain mysterious Thom\r\nReid had met her and demanded that she should renounce Christianity and\r\nher baptism, and apparently worship him. There can be little doubt that\r\nhe was “the Devil” of a coven, for the original details, which are very\r\nfull, all point to this. He seems to have played his part with some\r\nforethought and skill, since when the accused stated that she often saw\r\nhim in the churchyard of Dalry, as also in the streets of Edinburgh,\r\nwhere he walked to and fro among other people and handled goods that were\r\nexposed on bulks for sale without attracting any special notice, and was\r\nthereupon asked why she did not address him, she replied that he had\r\nforbidden her to recognize him on any such occasion unless he made a sign\r\nor first actually accosted her. She was “convict and burnt.”[13] In the\r\ncase of Alison Peirson, tried 28 May, 1588, “the Devil” was actually her\r\nkinsman, William Sympson, and she “wes conuict of the vsing of Sorcerie\r\nand Witchcraft, with the Inuocatioun of the spreitis of the Deuill;\r\nspeciallie in the visioune and forme of ane Mr. William Sympsoune, hir\r\ncousing and moder-brotheris-sone, quha sche affermit wes ane grit scoller\r\nand doctor of medicin.”[14] _Conuicta et combusta_ is the terse record of\r\nthe margin of the court-book.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting identifications of “the Devil” occurs in the\r\ncourse of the notorious trials of Dr. Fian and his associates in 1590-1.\r\nAs is well known, the whole crew was in league with Francis Stewart, Earl\r\nof Bothwell, and even at the time well-founded gossip, and something more\r\nthan gossip, freely connected his name with the spells, Sabbats, and\r\norgies of the witches. He was vehemently suspected of the black art; he\r\nwas an undoubted client of warlocks and poisoners; his restless ambition\r\nalmost overtly aimed at the throne, and the witch covens were one and\r\nall frantically attempting the life of King James. There can be no sort\r\nof doubt that Bothwell was the moving force who energized and directed\r\nthe very elaborate and numerous organization of demonolaters, which was\r\nalmost accidentally brought to light, to be fiercely crushed by the\r\ndraconian vengeance of a monarch justly frightened for his crown and his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth century both Albert Pike of Charleston and his\r\nsuccessor Adriano Lemmi have been identified upon abundant authority as\r\nbeing Grand Masters of societies practising Satanism, and as performing\r\nthe hierarchical functions of “the Devil” at the modern Sabbat.\r\n\r\nGod, so far as His ordinary presence and action in Nature are concerned,\r\nis hidden behind the veil of secondary causes, and when God’s ape, the\r\nDemon, can work so successfully and obtain not merely devoted adherents\r\nbut fervent worshippers by human agency, there is plainly no need for him\r\nto manifest himself in person either to particular individuals or at the\r\nSabbats, but none the less, that he can do so and has done so is certain,\r\nsince such is the sense of the Church, and there are many striking cases\r\nin the records and trials which are to be explained in no other way.\r\n\r\nThat, as Burns Begg pointed out, the witches not unseldom “seem to have\r\nbeen undoubtedly the victims of unscrupulous and designing knaves, who\r\npersonated Satan”[15] is no palliation of their crimes, and therefore\r\nthey are not one whit the less guilty of sorcery and devil-worship, for\r\nthis was their hearts’ intention and desire. Nor do I think that the man\r\nwho personated Satan at their assemblies was so much an unscrupulous and\r\ndesigning knave as himself a demonist, believing intensely in the reality\r\nof his own dark powers, wholly and horribly dedicated and doomed to the\r\nservice of evil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD TOST AT TENNIS. The First Quarto\r\n\r\n[_face p. 8_]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the witches were upon occasion wont to array\r\nthemselves in skins and ritual masks and there is complete evidence\r\nthat the hierophant at the Sabbat, when a human being played that rôle,\r\ngenerally wore a corresponsive, if somewhat more elaborate, disguise.\r\nNay more, as regards the British Isles at least—and it seems clear that\r\nin other countries the habit was very similar—we possess a pictorial\r\nrepresentation of “the Devil” as he appeared to the witches. During the\r\nfamous Fian trials Agnes Sampson confessed: “The deuell wes cled in ane\r\nblak goun with ane blak hat vpon his head.... His faice was terrible, his\r\nnoise lyk the bek of ane egle, greet bournyng eyn; his handis and leggis\r\nwer herry, with clawes vpon his handis, and feit lyk the griffon.”[16]\r\nIn the pamphlet _Newes from Scotland, Declaring the Damnable life and\r\ndeath of Doctor Fian_[17] we have a rough woodcut, repeated twice, which\r\nshows “the Devil” preaching from the North Berwick pulpit to the whole\r\ncoven of witches, and allowing for the crudity of the draughtsman and\r\na few unimportant differences of detail—the black gown and hat are not\r\nportrayed—the demon in the picture is exactly like the description Agnes\r\nSampson gave. It must be remembered, too, that at the Sabbat she was\r\nobviously in a state of morbid excitation, in part due to deep cups of\r\nheady wine, the time was midnight, the place a haunted old church, the\r\nonly light a few flickering candles that burned with a ghastly blue flame.\r\n\r\nNow “the Devil” as he is shown in the _Newes from Scotland_ illustration\r\nis precisely the Devil who appears upon the title-page of Middleton and\r\nRowley’s Masque, _The World tost at Tennis_, 4to, 1620. This woodcut\r\npresents an episode towards the end of the masque, and here the Devil\r\nin traditional disguise, a grim black hairy shape with huge beaked\r\nnose, monstrous claws, and the cloven hoofs of a griffin, in every\r\nparticular fits the details so closely observed by Agnes Sampson. I\r\nhave no doubt that the drawing for the masque was actually made in the\r\ntheatre, for although this kind of costly and decorative entertainment\r\nwas almost always designed for court or some great nobleman’s house we\r\nknow that _The World tost at Tennis_ was produced with considerable\r\nsuccess on the public stage “By the Prince his Seruants.” The dress,\r\nthen, of “the Devil” at the Sabbats seems frequently to have been an\r\nelaborate theatrical costume, such as might have been found in the stock\r\nwardrobe of a rich playhouse at London, but which would have had no such\r\nassociations for provincial folk and even simpler rustics.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the sceptics have pointed to the many cases upon record\r\nof a victim’s sickness or death following the witch’s curse, and have\r\nincredulously inquired if it be possible that a malediction should have\r\nsuch consequences. Whilst candidly remarking that personally I believe\r\nthere is power for evil and even for destruction in such a bane, that a\r\ndeadly anathema launched with concentrated hate and all the energy of\r\nvolition may bring unhappiness and fatality in its train, I would—since\r\nthey will not allow this—answer their objections upon other lines. When\r\nsome person who had in any way annoyed the witch was to be harmed or\r\nkilled, it was obviously convenient, when practicable, to follow up the\r\nsymbolism of the solemn imprecation, or it might be of the melted wax\r\nimage riddled with pins, by a dose of subtly administered poison, which\r\nwould bring about the desired result, whether sickness or death; and\r\nfrom the evidence concerning the witches’ victims, who so frequently\r\npined owing to a wasting disease, it seems more than probable that lethal\r\ndrugs were continually employed, for as Professor A. J. Clark records\r\n“the society of witches had a very creditable knowledge of the art of\r\npoisoning,”[18] and they are known to have freely used aconite, deadly\r\nnightshade (belladonna), and hemlock.\r\n\r\nSo far then from the confessions of the witches being mere hysteria\r\nand hallucination they are proved, even upon the most material\r\ninterpretation, to be in the main hideous and horrible fact.\r\n\r\nIn choosing examples to demonstrate this I have as yet referred almost\r\nentirely to the witchcraft which raged from the middle of the thirteenth\r\nto the beginning of the eighteenth century, inasmuch as that was the\r\nperiod when the diabolic cult reached its height, when it spread as a\r\nblight and a scourge throughout Europe and flaunted its most terrific\r\nproportions. But it must not for a moment be supposed, as has often been\r\nsuperficially believed, that Witchcraft was a product of the Middle\r\nAges, and that only then did authority adopt measures of repression\r\nand legislate against the warlock and the sorceress. If attention has\r\nbeen concentrated upon that period it is because during those and the\r\nsucceeding centuries Witchcraft blazed forth with unexampled virulence\r\nand ferocity, that it threatened the peace, nay in some degree, the\r\nsalvation of mankind. But even pagan emperors had issued edicts\r\nabsolutely forbidding goetic theurgy, confiscating grimoires (_fatidici\r\nlibri_) and visiting necromancers with death. In A.U.C. 721 during\r\nthe triumvirate of Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus, all astrologers and\r\ncharmers were banished.[19] Maecenas called upon Augustus to punish\r\nsorcerers, and plainly stated that those who devote themselves to magic\r\nare despisers of the gods.[20] More than two thousand popular books of\r\nspells, both in Greek and Latin, were discovered in Rome and publicly\r\nburned.[21] In the reign of Tiberius a decree of the Senate exiled all\r\ntraffickers in occult arts; Lucius Pituanius, a notorious wizard, they\r\nthrew from the Tarpeian rock, and another, Publius Martius, was executed\r\n_more prisco_ outside the Esquiline gate.[22]\r\n\r\nUnder Claudius the Senate reiterated the sentence of banishment:\r\n“De mathematicis Italia pellendis factum Senatus consultum, atrox\r\net irritum,” says Tacitus.[23] During the few months he was emperor\r\nVitellius proceeded with implacable severity against all soothsayers and\r\ndiviners; many of whom, when accused, he ordered for instant execution,\r\nnot even affording them the tritest formality of a trial.[24] Vespasian,\r\nagain, his successor, refused to permit scryers and enchanters to set\r\nfoot in Italy, strictly enforcing the existent statutes.[25] It is clear\r\nfrom all these stringent laws, and the list of examples might be greatly\r\nextended, that although under the Cæsars omens were respected, oracles\r\nwere consulted, the augurs honoured, and haruspices revered, the dark\r\ninfluences and foul criminality of the reverse of that dangerous science\r\nwere recognized and its professors punished with the full force of\r\nrepeated legislation.\r\n\r\nM. de Cauzons has expressed himself somewhat vigorously when speaking\r\nof writers who trace the origins of Witchcraft to the Middle Ages:\r\n“C’est une mauvaise plaisanterie,” he remarks,[26] “ou une contrevérité\r\nflagrante, d’affirmer que la sorcellerie naquit au Moyen-Age, et\r\nd’attribuer son existence à l’influence ou aux croyances de l’Eglise.”\r\n(It is either a silly jest or inept irony to pretend that Witchcraft\r\narose in the Middle Ages, to attribute its existence to the influence or\r\nthe beliefs of the Catholic Church.)\r\n\r\nAn even more erroneous assertion is the charge which has been not\r\ninfrequently but over-emphatically brought forward by partial\r\nill-documented historians to the effect that the European crusade against\r\nwitches, the stern and searching prosecutions with the ultimate penalty\r\nof death at the stake, are entirely due to the Bull _Summis desiderantes\r\naffectibus_, 5 December, 1484, of Pope Innocent VIII; or that at any\r\nrate this famous document, if it did not actually initiate the campaign,\r\nblew to blasts of flame and fury the smouldering and half-cold embers.\r\nThis is most preposterously affirmed by Mackay, who does not hesitate\r\nto write[27]: “There happened at that time to be a pontiff at the head\r\nof the Church who had given much of his attention to the subject of\r\nWitchcraft, and who, with the intention of rooting out the supposed\r\ncrime, did more to increase it than any other man that ever lived. John\r\nBaptist Cibo, elected to the papacy in 1485,[28] under the designation\r\nof Innocent VIII, was sincerely alarmed at the number of witches, and\r\nlaunched forth his terrible manifesto against them. In his celebrated\r\nbull of 1488, he called the nations of Europe to the rescue of the Church\r\nof Christ upon earth, ‘imperilled by the arts of Satan’” which last\r\nsentence seems to be a very fair statement of fact. Lecky notes the Bull\r\nof Innocent which, he extravagantly declares, “gave a fearful impetus to\r\nthe persecution.”[29] Dr. Davidson, in a brief but slanderous account\r\nof this great pontiff, gives angry prominence to his severity “against\r\nsorcerers, magicians, and witches.”[30] It is useless to cite more of\r\nthese superficial and crooked judgements; but since even authorities of\r\nweight and value have been deluded and fallen into the snare it is worth\r\nwhile labouring the point a little and stressing the fact that the\r\nBull of Innocent VIII was only one of a long series of Papal ordinances\r\ndealing with the suppression of a monstrous and almost universal evil.[31]\r\n\r\nThe first Papal Bull directly launched against the black art and its\r\nprofessors was that of Alexander IV, 13 December, 1258, addressed to\r\nthe Franciscan inquisitors. And it is worth while here to examine\r\nprecisely what was the earlier connotation of the terms “inquisitor”\r\nand “inquisition,” so often misunderstood, as our research, though\r\nbrief, will throw a flood of light upon the subject of Witchcraft, and,\r\nmoreover, incidentally will serve to explain how that those writers who\r\nassign the beginnings of Witchcraft to the Middle Ages, although most\r\ncertainly and even demonstrably in error, have at any rate been very\r\nsubtilely and easily led wrong, since sorcery in the Middle Ages was\r\nviolently unmasked and the whole horrid craft then first authoritatively\r\nexposed in its darkest colours and most abominable manifestations, as\r\nhad indeed existed from the first, but had been carefully hidden and\r\nscrupulously concealed.\r\n\r\nBy the term Inquisition (_inquirere_ = to look into) is now generally\r\nunderstood a special ecclesiastical institution for combating or\r\nsuppressing heresy, and the Inquisitors are the officials attached to\r\nthe said institution, more particularly judges who are appointed to\r\ninvestigate the charges of heresy and to try the persons brought before\r\nthem on those charges. During the first twelve centuries the Church was\r\nloath to deal with heretics save by argument and persuasion; obstinate\r\nand avowed heretics were, of course, excluded from her communion, a\r\ndefection which in the ages of faith, naturally involved them in many and\r\ngreat difficulties. S. Augustine,[32] S. John Chrysostom,[33] S. Isidore\r\nof Seville[34] in the seventh century, and a number of other Doctors\r\nand Fathers held that for no cause whatsoever should the Church shed\r\nblood; but, on the other hand, the imperial successors of Constantine\r\njustly considered that they were obliged to have a care for the material\r\nwelfare of the Church here on earth, and that heresy is always inevitably\r\nand inextricably entangled with attempts on the social order, always\r\nanarchical, always political. Even the pagan persecutor Diocletian\r\nrecognized this fact, which heretics, until they obtain the upper hand,\r\nhave throughout the ages consistently denied and endeavoured to disguise.\r\nFor in 287, less than two years after his accession, he sent to the\r\nstake the leaders of the Manichees; the majority of their followers were\r\nbeheaded, and a few less culpable sent to perpetual forced labour in the\r\ngovernment mines. Again in 296 he orders their extermination (_stirpitus\r\namputari_) as a sordid, vile, and impure sect. So the Christian Cæsars,\r\npersuaded that the protection of orthodoxy was their sacred duty, began\r\nto issue edicts for the suppression of heretics as being traitors\r\nand anti-social revolutionaries.[35] But the Church protested, and\r\nwhen Priscillian, Bishop of Avila, being found guilty of heresy and\r\nsorcery,[36] was condemned to death by Maximus at Trier in 384, S. Martin\r\nof Tours addressed the Emperor in such plain terms that it was solemnly\r\npromised the sentence should not be carried into effect. However, the\r\npledge was broken, and S. Martin’s indignation was such that for a long\r\nwhile he refused to hold communion with those who had been in any way\r\nresponsible for the execution, which S. Ambrose roundly stigmatized as a\r\nheinous crime.[37] Even more crushing were the words of Pope S. Siricius,\r\nbefore whom Maximus was fain to humble himself in lowliest penitence, and\r\nthe supreme pontiff actually excommunicated Bishop Felix of Trier for his\r\npart in the deed.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time heretics were put to death under the civil law to\r\nwhich they were amenable, as in 556 when a band of Manichees were\r\nexecuted at Ravenna. Pope Pelagius I, who was consecrated that very\r\nyear, when Paulinus of Fossombrone, rejecting his authority, openly\r\nstirred up schism and revolt, merely relegated the recalcitrant bishop\r\nto a monastery. Saint Cæsarius of Arles, who died in 547, speaking[38]\r\nof the punishment to be meted out to those who obstinately persevere\r\nin overt paganism, recommends that they should first be remonstrated\r\nwith and reprimanded, that they should if possible be thus persuaded of\r\ntheir errors; but if they persist certain corporal chastisement is to be\r\ngiven; and in extreme cases a course of domestic discipline, the cutting\r\nof the hair close as a mark of indignity and confinement within doors\r\nunder restraint, may be adopted. There is no hint of anything more than\r\nprivate measures, no calling in of any ecclesiastical authority, far\r\nless an appeal to any punitive tribunal.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Charlemagne the aged Elipandus, Archbishop of Toledo,\r\ntaught an offshoot of the Nestorian heresy, Adoptionism, a crafty but\r\ndeadly error, to which he won the slippery dialectician Felix of Urgel.\r\nFelix, as a Frankish prelate, was summoned to Aix-la-Chapelle. A synod\r\ncondemned his doctrine and he recanted, only to retract his words and to\r\nreiterate his blasphemies. He was again condemned, and again he recanted.\r\nBut he proved shifty and tricksome to the last. For after his death\r\nAgobar of Lyons found amongst his papers a scroll asserting that of this\r\nheresy he was fully persuaded, in spite of any contradictions to which he\r\nmight hypocritically subscribe. Yet Felix only suffered a short detention\r\nat Rome, whilst no measures seem to have been taken against Elipandus,\r\nwho died in his errors. It was presumably considered that orthodoxy could\r\nbe sufficiently served and vindicated by the zeal of such great names as\r\nBeatus, Abbot of Libana; Etherius, Bishop of Osma; S. Benedict of Aniane;\r\nand the glorious Alcuin.[39]\r\n\r\nSome forty years later, about the middle of the ninth century,\r\nGothescalch, a monk of Fulda, caused great scandal by obstinately and\r\nimpudently maintaining that Christ had not died for all mankind, a\r\nforetaste of the Calvinistic heresy. He was condemned at the Synods\r\nof Mainz in 848, and of Kiersey-sur-Oise in 849, being sentenced to\r\nflogging and imprisonment, punishments then common in monasteries\r\nfor various infractions of the rule. In this case, as particularly\r\nflagrant, it was Hinemar, Archbishop of Rheims, a prelate notorious\r\nfor his severity, who sentenced the culprit to incarceration. But\r\nGothescalch had by his pernicious doctrines been the cause of serious\r\ndisturbances; and his inflammatory harangues had excited tumults,\r\nsedition, and unrest, bringing odium upon the sacred habit. The sentence\r\nof the Kiersey Synod ran: “Frater Goteschale ... quia et ecclesiastica\r\net ciuilia negotia contra propositum et nomen monachi conturbare iura\r\necclesiastica præsumpsisti, durissimis uerberibus te cagistari et\r\nsecundum ecclesiasticas regulas ergastulo retrudi, auctoritate episcopali\r\ndecernimus.” (Brother Gothescalch, ... because thou hast dared—contrary\r\nto thy monastic calling and vows—to concern thyself in worldly as well\r\nas spiritual businesses and hast violated all ecclesiastical law and\r\norder, by our episcopal authority we condemn thee to be severely scourged\r\nand according to the provision of the Church to be closely imprisoned.)\r\n\r\nFrom these instances it will be seen that the Church throughout all those\r\ncenturies of violence, rapine, invasion, and war, when often primitive\r\nsavagery reigned supreme and the most hideous cruelty was the general\r\norder of the day, dealt very gently with the rebel and the heretic, whom\r\nshe might have executed wholesale with the greatest ease; no voice would\r\nhave been raised in protest save that of her own pontiffs, doctors,\r\nand Saints; nay, rather, such repression would have been universally\r\napplauded as eminently proper and just. But it was the civil power who\r\narraigned the anarch and the misbeliever, who sentenced him to death.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1000, however, the venom of Manichæism obtained a new\r\nfooting in the West, where it had died out early in the sixth century.\r\nBetween 1030-40 an important Manichæan community was discovered at\r\nthe Castle of Monteforte, near Asti, in Piedmont. Some of the members\r\nwere arrested by the Bishop of Asti and a number of noblemen in the\r\nneighbourhood, and upon their refusal to retract the civil arm burned\r\nthem. Others, by order of the Archbishop of Milan, Ariberto, were brought\r\nto that city since he hoped to convert them. They answered his efforts\r\nby attempts to make proselytes; whereupon Lanzano, a prominent noble and\r\nleader of the popular party, caused the magistrates to intervene and when\r\nthey had been taken into the custody of the State they were executed\r\nwithout further respite. For the next two hundred years Manichæism\r\nspread its infernal teaching in secret until, towards the year 1200,\r\nthe plague had infected all Italy and Southern Europe, had reached\r\nnorthwards to Germany, where it was completely organized, and was not\r\nunknown in England, since as early as 1159 thirty foreign Manichees had\r\nprivily settled here. They were discovered in 1166, and handed over to\r\nthe secular authorities by the Bishops of the Council of Oxford. In high\r\nwrath Henry II ordered them to be scourged, branded in the forehead, and\r\ncast adrift in the cold of winter, straightly forbidding any to succour\r\nsuch vile criminals, so all perished from cold and exposure. Manichæism\r\nfurthermore split up into an almost infinite number of sects and systems,\r\nprominent amongst which were the Cathari, the Aldonistæ and Speronistæ,\r\nthe Concorrezenses of Lombardy, the Bagnolenses, the Albigenses,\r\nPauliciani, Patarini, Bogomiles, the Waldenses, Tartarins, Beghards,\r\nPauvres de Lyon.\r\n\r\nIt must be clearly borne in mind that these heretical bodies with their\r\nendless ramifications were not merely exponents of erroneous religious\r\nand intellectual beliefs by which they morally corrupted all who came\r\nunder their influence, but they were the avowed enemies of law and\r\norder, red-hot anarchists who would stop at nothing to gain their ends.\r\nTerrorism and secret murder were their most frequent weapons. In 1199\r\nthe Patarini followers of Ermanno of Parma and Gottardo of Marsi, two\r\nfirebrands of revolt, foully assassinated S. Peter Parenzo, the governor\r\nof Orvieto. On 6 April, 1252, whilst returning from Como to Milan, as he\r\npassed through a lonely wood S. Peter of Verona was struck down by the\r\naxe of a certain Carino, a Manichæan bravo, who had been hired to the\r\ndeed.[40] By such acts they sought to intimidate whole districts, and to\r\ncompel men’s allegiance with blood and violence. The Manichæan system was\r\nin truth a simultaneous attack upon the Church and the State, a desperate\r\nbut well-planned organization to destroy the whole fabric of society, to\r\nreduce civilization to chaos. In the first instance, as the Popes began\r\nto perceive the momentousness of the struggle they engaged the bishops to\r\nstem the tide. At the Council of Tours, 1163, Alexander III called upon\r\nthe bishops of Gascony to take active measures for the suppression of\r\nthese revolutionaries, but at the Lateran Council of 1179 it was found\r\nthese disturbers of public order had sown such sedition in Languedoc that\r\nan appeal was made to the secular power to check the evil. In 1184 Lucius\r\nIII issued from Verona his Bull _Ad Abolendam_ which expressly mentions\r\nmany of the heretics by name, Cathari, Patarini, Humiliati, Pauvres de\r\nLyon, Pasagians, Josephins, Aldonistæ. The situation had fast developed\r\nand become serious. Heretics were to be sought out and suitably punished,\r\nby which, however, capital punishment is not intended. Innocent III,\r\nalthough adding nothing essential to these regulations yet gave them\r\nfuller scope and clearer definition. In his Decretals he precisely\r\nspeaks of accusation, denunciation, and inquisition, and it is obvious\r\nthat these measures were necessary in the face of a great secret society\r\naiming at nothing less than the destruction of the established order,\r\nfor all the sectaries were engaged upon the most zealous propaganda,\r\nand their adherents had spread like a network over the greater part of\r\nEurope. The members bore the title of “brother” and “sister,” and had\r\nwords and signs by which the initiate could recognize one another without\r\nbetraying themselves to others.[41] Ivan de Narbonne, who was converted\r\nfrom this heresy, in a letter to Giraldus, Archbishop of Bordeaux, as\r\nquoted by Matthew of Paris, says that in every city where he travelled he\r\nwas always able to make himself known by signs.[42]\r\n\r\nIt was necessary that the diocesan bishops should be assisted in their\r\nheavy task of tracking down heretics, and accordingly the Holy See had\r\nresource to legates who were furnished with extraordinary powers to\r\ncope with so perplexing a situation. In 1177 as legate of Alexander\r\nIII, Peter, Cardinal of San Crisogono, at the particular request of\r\nCount Raymond V, visited the Toulouse district to check the rising tide\r\nof Catharist doctrine.[43] In 1181, Henry, Abbot of Clairvaux, who had\r\nbeen in his suite, now Cardinal of Albano, as legate of the same Pope,\r\nreceived the submission of various heretical leaders, and, so extensive\r\nwere his powers, solemnly deposed the Archbishops of Lyons and Narbonne.\r\nIn 1203 Peter of Castelnau and Raoul were acting at Toulouse on behalf\r\nof Innocent III, seemingly with plenipotentiary authority. The next year\r\nArnauld Amaury, Abbot of Citeaux, was joined to them to form a triple\r\ntribunal with absolute power to judge heretics in the provinces of Aix,\r\nArles, Narbonne, and the adjoining dioceses. At the death of Innocent III\r\n(1216) there existed an organization to search out heretics; episcopal\r\ntribunals at which often sat an assessor (the future inquisitor) to watch\r\nthe conduct of the case; and above all the legate to whom he might make a\r\nreport. The legate, from his position, was naturally a prelate occupied\r\nwith a vast number of urgent affairs—Arnauld Amaury, for example, was\r\nabsent for a considerable time to take part in the General Chapter\r\nat Cluny—and gradually more and more authority was delegated to the\r\nassessor, who insensibly developed into the Inquisitor, a special but\r\npermanent judge acting in the name of the Pope, by whom he was invested\r\nwith the right and the duty to deal legally with offences against the\r\nFaith. And as just at this time there came into being two new Orders, the\r\nDominicans and Franciscans, whose members by their theological training\r\nand the very nature of their vows seemed eminently fitted to perform the\r\ninquisitorial task with complete success, absolutely uninfluenced by any\r\nworldly motive, it is natural that the new officials should have been\r\nselected from these Orders, and, owing to the importance attached by the\r\nDominicans to the study of divinity, especially from their learned ranks.\r\n\r\nIt is very obvious why the Holy See so sagaciously preferred to assign\r\nthe prosecution of heretics, a matter of the first importance, to an\r\nextraordinary tribunal rather than leave the trials in the hands of the\r\nbishops. Without taking into consideration the fact that these new duties\r\nwould have seriously encroached upon, if not wholly absorbed, the time\r\nand activities of a bishop, the prelates who ruled most dioceses were\r\nthe subject of some monarch with whom they might have come in conflict\r\non many a delicate point which could easily be conceived to arise, and\r\nthe result of such disagreement would have been fraught with endless\r\npolitical difficulties and internal embarrassments. A court of religious,\r\nresponsible to the Pope alone, would act more fairly, more freely,\r\nwithout fear or favour. The profligate Philip I of France, for example,\r\nduring his long, worthless, and dishonoured reign (1060-1108), by his\r\nevil courses drew upon himself the censure of the Church, whereupon\r\nhe banished the Bishop of Beauvais and revoked the decisions of the\r\nepiscopal courts.[44] In a letter[45] to William, Count of Poitiers,\r\nPope S. Gregory VII energetically declares that if the King does not\r\ncease from molesting the bishops and interfering with their judicature\r\na sentence of excommunication will be launched. In another letter the\r\nsame pontiff complains of the disrespect shown to the ecclesiastical\r\ntribunals, and addressing the French bishops he cries: “Your king, who\r\nsooth to say should be termed not a king but a cruel tyrant, inspired\r\nby Satan, is the head and cause of these evils. For he has notoriously\r\npassed all his days in foulest crimes, in seeking to do wickedness and to\r\nensue it.”[46] The conflict of the bishops of a realm with an unworthy\r\nand evil monarch is a commonplace of history. These troubles could\r\nscarcely arise in the case of courts forane.\r\n\r\nThe words “inquisition” and “inquisitors” began definitely to acquire\r\ntheir accepted signification in the earlier half of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. Thus in 1235 Gregory IX writes to the Archbishop of Sens: “Know\r\nthen that we have charged the Provincial of the Order of Preachers in\r\nthis same realm to nominate certain of his brethren, who are best fitted\r\nfor so weighty a business, as Inquisitors that they may proceed against\r\nall notorious evildoers in the aforesaid realm ... and we also charge\r\nthee, dear Brother, that thou shouldest be instant and zealous in this\r\nmatter of establishing an Inquisition by the appointment of those who\r\nseem to be best fitted for such a work, and let thy loins be girded,\r\nBrother, to fight boldly the battles of the Lord.”[47] In 1246 Innocent\r\nIV wrote to the Superiors of the Franciscans giving them leave to recall\r\nat will: “those brethren who have been sent abroad to preach the Mystery\r\nof the Cross of Christ, or to seek out and take measure against the\r\nplague sore of heresy.”[48]\r\n\r\nAll the heresies, and the Secret Societies of heretics, which infested\r\nEurope during the Middle Ages were Gnostic, and even more narrowly,\r\nManichæan in character. The Gnostics arose almost with the advent of\r\nChristianity as a School or Schools who explained the teachings of Christ\r\nby blending them with the doctrines of pagan fantasts, and thus they\r\nclaimed to have a Higher and a Wider Knowledge, the Γνῶσις the first\r\nexponent of which was unquestionably Simon Magus. “Two problems borrowed\r\nfrom heathen philosophy,” says Mansel,[49] “were intruded by Gnosticism\r\non the Christian revelation, the problem of absolute existence, and\r\nthe problem of the Origin of Evil.” The Gnostics denied the existence\r\nof Free-will, and therefore Evil was not the result of Man’s voluntary\r\ntransgression, but must in some way have emanated from the Creator\r\nHimself. Arguing on these lines the majority asserted that the Creator\r\nmust have been a malignant power, Lord of the Kingdom of Darkness,\r\nopposed to the Supreme and Ineffable God. This doctrine was taught by\r\nthe Gnostic sects of Persia, which became deeply imbued with the religion\r\nof Zoroaster, who assumed the existence of two original and independent\r\nPowers of Good and of Evil. Each of these Powers is of equal strength,\r\nand supreme in his own dominions, whilst constant war is waged between\r\nthe two. This doctrine was particularly held by the Syrian Gnostics, the\r\nOphites, the Naasseni, the Peratæ, the Sethians, amongst whom the serpent\r\nwas the principal symbol. As the Creator of the world was evil, the\r\nTempter, the Serpent, was the benefactor of man. In fact, in some creeds\r\nhe was identified with the Logos. The Cainites carried out the Ophite\r\ndoctrines to their fullest logical conclusion. Since the Creator, the\r\nGod of the Old Testament, is evil all that is commended by the Scripture\r\nmust be evil, and conversely all that is condemned therein is good. Cain,\r\nKorah, the rebels, are to be imitated and admired. The one true Apostle\r\nwas Judas Iscariot. This cult is very plainly marked in the Middle Ages\r\namong the Luciferians; and Cainite ceremonies have their place in the\r\nwitches’ Sabbat.[50]\r\n\r\nAll this Gnostic teaching was summed up in the gospel of the Persian\r\nMani, who, when but a young man of twenty-six, seems first to have\r\nproclaimed in the streets and bazaars of Seleucia-Ctesiphon his supposed\r\nmessage on Sunday, 20 March, 242, the coronation festival of Shapur I.\r\nHe did not meet with immediate success in his own country, but here\r\nand there his ideas took deep root. In 276-277, however, he was seized\r\nand crucified by the grandson of Shapur, Bahram I, his disciples being\r\nrelentlessly pursued. Whenever Manichees were discovered they were\r\nbrought to swift justice, executed, held up to universal hatred and\r\ncontempt. They were considered by Moslems as not merely Unbelievers,\r\nthe followers of a false impostor, but unnatural and unsocial, a menace\r\nto the State. It was for no light cause that the Manichee was loathed\r\nand abhorred both by faithful Christian and by those who proclaimed\r\nMohammed as the true prophet of Allah. But later Manichæism spread\r\nin every direction to an extraordinary degree, which may perhaps be\r\naccounted for by the fact that it is in some sense a synthesis of the\r\nGnostic philosophies, the theory of two eternal principles, good and\r\nevil, being especially emphasized. Moreover, the historical Jesus,\r\n“the Jewish Messias, whom the Jews crucified,” was “a devil, who was\r\njustly punished for interfering in the work of the Æon Jesus,” who was\r\nneither born nor suffered death. As time went on, the elaborate cosmogony\r\nof Mani disappeared, but the idea that the Christ must be repudiated\r\nremained. And logically, then, worship is due to the enemy of Christ,\r\nand a sub-sect, the Messalians or Euchites, taught that divine honours\r\nmust be paid to Satan, who is further to be propitiated by means of every\r\npossible outrage done to Christ. This, of course, is plain and simple\r\nSatanism openly avowed. Carpocrates even went so far as to aggravate the\r\nteaching of the Cainites, for he made the performance of every species\r\nof sin forbidden in the Old Testament a solemn duty, since this was the\r\ncompletest mode of showing defiance to the Evil Creator and Ruler of the\r\nWorld. This doctrine was wholly that of mediæval witches, and is flaunted\r\nby modern Satanists. Although the Manichees affected the greatest purity,\r\nit is quite certain that not unchastity but the act of generation alone\r\nwas opposed to their views; secretly they practised the most hideous\r\nobscenities.[51] The Messalians in particular, vaunted a treatise\r\n_Asceticus_, which was condemned by the Third General Council of Ephesus\r\n(431) as “that filthy book of this heresy,” and in Armenia, in the fifth\r\ncentury, special edicts were passed to restrain their immoralities, so\r\nthat their very name became the equivalent for “lewdness.” The Messalians\r\nsurvived unto the Middle Ages as Bogomiles.\r\n\r\nAttention has already been drawn to the striking fact that even\r\nDiocletian legislated with no small vigour against the Manichees, and\r\nwhen we find Valentinian I and his son Gratian, although tolerant of\r\nother bodies, passing laws of equal severity in this regard (372), we\r\nfeel that such interdiction is especially significant. Theodosius I, by\r\na statute of 381, declared Manichees to be without civil rights, and\r\nincapable of inheriting; in the following year he condemned them to\r\ndeath, and in 389 he sternly directed the rigorous enforcement to the\r\nletter of these penalties.\r\n\r\nValentinian II confiscated their goods, annulled their wills, and sent\r\nthem into exile. Honorius in 399 renewed the draconian measures of his\r\npredecessors; in 405 he heavily fined all governors of provinces or\r\ncivil magistrates who were slack in carrying out his orders; in 407 he\r\npronounced the sect outlaws and public criminals having no legal status\r\nwhatsoever, and in 408 he reiterated the former enactments in meticulous\r\ndetail to afford no loophole of escape. Theodosius II (423), again,\r\nrepeated this legislation, whilst Valentinian III passed fresh laws in\r\n425 and 445. Anastasius once more decreed the penalty of death, which\r\nwas even extended by Justin and Justinian to convert from Manichæism who\r\ndid not at once denounce their former coreligionists to the authorities.\r\nThis catena of laws which aims at nothing less than extermination is of\r\nsingular moment.\r\n\r\nAbout 660 arose the Paulicians, a Manichæan sect, who rejected the Old\r\nTestament, the Sacraments, and the Priesthood. In 835 it was realized\r\nthat the government of this body was political and aimed at revolution\r\nand red anarchy. In 970 John Zimisces fixed their headquarters in\r\nThrace. In 1115 Alexis Comnenus established himself during the winter\r\nat Philippopolis, and avowed his intention of converting them, the only\r\nresult being that the heretics were driven westward and spread rapidly in\r\nFrance and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Bogomiles were also Manichees. They openly worshipped Satan,\r\nrepudiating Holy Mass and the Passion, rejecting Holy Baptism for some\r\nfoul ceremony of their own, and possessing a peculiar version of the\r\nGospel of S. John. As Cathari these wretches had their Centre for France\r\nat Toulouse; for Germany at Cologne; whilst in Italy, Milan, Florence,\r\nOrvieto, and Viterbo were their rallying-points. Their meetings were\r\noften held in the open air, on mountains, or in the depths of some lone\r\nvalley; the ritual was very secret, but we know that at night they\r\ncelebrated their Eucharist of Consolamentum, when all stood in a circle\r\nround a table covered with a white cloth and numerous torches were\r\nkindled, the service being closed by the reading of the first seventeen\r\nverses of their transfigured gospel. Bread was broken, but there is a\r\ntradition that the words of consecration were not pronounced according to\r\nthe Christian formula; in some instances they were altogether omitted.\r\n\r\nDuring the eleventh century, then, there began to spread throughout\r\nEurope a number of mysterious organizations whose adherents, in a\r\nsecrecy that was all but absolute, practiced obscure rites embodying\r\ntheir beliefs, the central feature of which was the adoration of the\r\nevil principle, the demon. But what is this save Satanism, or in other\r\nwords Witchcraft? It is true that when these heresies came into sharp\r\nconflict with the Catholic Church they developed on lines which lost\r\nvarious non-essential accretions and Eastern subtleties of extravagant\r\nthought, but the motive of the Manichæan doctrines and of Witchcraft is\r\none and the same, and the punishment of Manichees and of witches was the\r\nsame death at the stake. The fact that these heretics were recognized\r\nas sorcerers will explain, as nothing else can, the severity of the\r\nstatutes against them, evidence of no ordinary depravity, and early in\r\nthe eleventh century Manichee and warlock are recognized as synonymous.\r\n\r\nThe sorcery of the Middle Ages, says Carl Haas, a learned and impartial\r\nauthority, was born from the heresies of earlier epochs, and just as\r\nChristian authority had dealt with heresy, so did it deal with the spawn\r\nwitchcraft. Both alike are the result of doubts, of faithlessness, a\r\ndisordered imagination, pride and presumption, intellectual arrogance;\r\nsick phantasy both, they grow and flourish apace in shadow and sin, until\r\nright reasoning, and sometimes salutary force, are definitely opposed to\r\nthem. The authors of the _Malleus Maleficarum_ clearly identify heresy\r\nand Witchcraft. When the Prince Bishop of Bamberg, John George II Fuchs\r\nvon Bornheim, (1623-33), built a strong prison especially for sorcerers,\r\nthe _Drudenhaus_, he set over the great door a figure of Justice, and\r\ninscribed above Vergil’s words: _Discite iustitiam moniti et non temnere\r\nDiuos_ (_Æneid_, VI, 620),\r\n\r\n    (Behold, and learn to practise right,\r\n    Nor do the blessed Gods despite).\r\n\r\nTo the right and the left were engraved upon two panels, the one Latin,\r\nthe other German, two verses from the Bible, 3 Kings ix. 8, 9; which are\r\nEnglished as follows: “This house shall be made an example of: every\r\none that shall pass by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss, and say:\r\nWhy hath the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house? And they\r\nshall answer: Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought their\r\nfathers out of the land of Egypt, and followed strange gods, and adored\r\nthem, and worshipped them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon them\r\nall this evil.” This is a concise summary of the basic reason for the\r\nprosecution of witches, the standpoint of Christian authority, whose\r\nprofessors justly and logically regarded sorcery as being in essence\r\nheresy, to be suppressed by the same measures, to be punished with the\r\nsame penalties.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the close correlation between Witchcraft and heresy\r\nthere is a very remarkable fact, the significance of which has—so far\r\nas I am aware—never been noted. The full fury of prosecution burst over\r\nEngland during the first half of the seventeenth century, that is to\r\nsay, shortly after the era of a great religious upheaval, when the work\r\nof rehabilitation and recovery so nobly initiated by Queen Mary I had\r\nbeen wrecked owing to the pride, lust, and baseness of her sister. In\r\nScotland, envenomed to the core with the poison of Calvin and Knox,\r\nfire and cord were seldom at rest. It is clear that heresy had brought\r\nWitchcraft swiftly in its train. Ireland has ever been singularly free\r\nfrom Witchcraft prosecutions, and with the rarest exceptions—chiefly, if\r\nnot solely, the famous Dame Alice Kyteler case of 1324—the few trials\r\nrecorded are of the seventeenth century and engineered by the Protestant\r\nparty. The reason for this exemption is plain. Until the stranger forced\r\nhis way into Ireland, heresy had no foothold there. That the Irish firmly\r\nbelieved in witches, we know, but the Devil’s claws were finely clipped.\r\n\r\nIn 1022 a number of Manichees were burned alive by order of Robert I.\r\nThey had been condemned by a Synod at Orleans and refused to recant\r\ntheir errors.[52] A contemporary document clearly identifies them with\r\nwitches, worshippers of the Demon, who appeared to them under the form\r\nof an animal. Other abominable rites are fully set forth, comparable to\r\nthe pages of Sprenger, Bodin, Boguet, De Lancre, Guazzo, and the rest.\r\nThe account runs as follows: “Before we proceed to other details I will\r\nat some length inform those who are as yet ignorant of these matters,\r\nhow that food which they call Food from Heaven is made and provided. On\r\ncertain nights of the year they all meet together in an appointed house,\r\neach one of them carrying a lantern in his hand. They then begin to sing\r\nthe names of various demons, as though they were chanting a litany,\r\nuntil suddenly they perceive that the Devil has appeared in the midst\r\nof them in the shape of some animal or other. As he would seem to be\r\nvisible to them all in some mysterious way they immediately extinguish\r\nthe lights, and each one of them as quickly as he can seizes upon the\r\nwoman, who chances to be nearest at hand.... When a child happens to\r\nbe born ... on the eighth day they all meet together and light a large\r\nfire in their midst, and then the child is passed through the fire,\r\nceremonially, according to the sacrifices of the old heathen, and\r\nfinally is burnt in the flames. The ashes are collected and reserved,\r\nwith the same veneration as Christians are wont to reserve the Blessed\r\nSacrament, and they give those who are on the point of death a portion\r\nof these ashes as if it were the Viaticum. There appears to be such\r\npower infused by the Devil into the said ashes that a man who belongs\r\nto these heretics and happens to have tasted even the smallest quantity\r\nof these ashes can scarcely ever be persuaded to abandon his heresies\r\nand to turn his thoughts towards the true path. It must suffice to give\r\nonly these details, as a warning to all Christians to take no part in\r\nthese abominations, and God forbid that curiosity should lead anybody to\r\nexplore them.”[53]\r\n\r\nAt Forfar, in 1661, Helen Guthrie and four other witches exhumed the\r\nbody of an unbaptised infant, which was buried in the churchyard near\r\nthe south-east door of the church, “and took severall peices thereof,\r\nas the feet, hands, a pairt of the head, and a pairt of the buttock,\r\nand they made a py thereof, that they might eat of it, that by this\r\nmeanes they might never make a confession (as they thought) of their\r\nwitchcraftis.”[54]\r\n\r\nThe belief of 1022 and 1661 is the same, because it is the same\r\norganization. The very name of the Vaudois, stout heretics, survives in\r\nVoodoo worship, which is, in effect, African fetishism or Witchcraft\r\ntransplanted to America soil.\r\n\r\nIn 1028 Count Alduin burned a number of Manichees at Angoulême, and the\r\nchronicle runs: “Interea iussu Alduini flammis exustæ sunt mulieres\r\nmaleficæ extra urbem.”[55] (About this time certain evil women, heretics,\r\nwere burned without the city by the command of Alduin.) The Templars,\r\nwhose Order was suppressed and the members thereof executed on account\r\nof their sorceries, were clearly a Society of Gnostic heretics, active\r\npropagandists, closely connected with the Bogomiles and the Mandæans or\r\nJohannites.[56]\r\n\r\nIt is true that in his recent study _The Religion of the Manichees_,[57]\r\nDr. F. G. Buskitt, with a wealth of interesting detail and research, has\r\nendeavoured to show that the Bogomiles, the Cathari, the Albigenses,\r\nand other unclean bodies only derived fragments of their teaching from\r\nManichæan sources, and he definitely states “I think it misleading to\r\ncall these sects, even the Albigensians, by the name of Manichees.” But\r\nin spite of his adroit special pleading the historical fact remains;\r\nalthough we may concede that the abominable beliefs of these various\r\nGnostics were perhaps a deduction from, or a development of, the actual\r\nteaching of Mani. Yet none the less their evil was contained in his\r\nheresy and a logical consequence of it.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of this century important discoveries of Manichæan\r\nMSS. have been made. Three or four scientific expeditions to Chinese\r\nTurkestan brought back some thousands of fragments, especially from the\r\nneighbourhood of a town called Turfan. Many of these screeds are written\r\nin the peculiar script of the Manichees, some of which can be deciphered,\r\nalthough unfortunately the newly found documents are mere scraps, bits of\r\ntorn books and rolls, and written in languages as yet imperfectly known.\r\nMuch of the new doctrine is of the wildest and most fantastic theosophy,\r\nand the initiate were, as we know, sufficiently cunning not to commit\r\nthe esoteric and true teachings to writing, but preferred that there\r\nshould be an oral tradition. One important piece, the _Khuastuanift_,\r\ni.e. “Confession,” has been recovered almost in its entirety. It is\r\nin the old Turkestan Turkish language, and seems full of the most\r\nastounding contradictions or paradoxes, a consensus of double meanings\r\nand subtleties.\r\n\r\nThe question is asked whether we ought to consider Manichæism as an\r\nindependent religion or a Christian heresy? Eznih of Kolb, the Armenian\r\nwriter of the fifth century, when attacking Zoroastrianism, obviously\r\ntreats Manichæism as a variety of Persian religion. The orthodox\r\ndocuments, however, from Mark the Deacon onwards treat Manichæism as in\r\nthe main a Christian heresy and this is assuredly the correct view. There\r\nis in existence a polemical fragment, a single ill-preserved pair of\r\nleaves, in which the Manichæan writer pours forth horrid blasphemies and\r\nvilely attacks those who call Mary’s Son (_Bar Maryam_) the Son of Adonay.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while here to say just a word correcting a curious\r\nold-fashioned misapprehension which once prevailed in certain quarters\r\nconcerning the Albigenses, an error of which we occasionally yet catch\r\nthe echoes, as when Mrs. Grenside wrote that the Albigenses were “a sect\r\nof the 14th century which, owing to their secret doctrine, endured much\r\necclesiastical persecution.”[58] The impression left, and it is one\r\nwhich was not altogether uncommon some seventy years ago, is that the\r\nAlbigensian was a stern old Protestant father, Bible and sword in hand,\r\nwho defended his hearth and home against the lawless brigands spurred\r\non to attack him by priestly machinations. Nothing, of course, could be\r\nfurther from the truth. The Albigensian was a Satanist, a worshipper of\r\nthe powers of evil, and he would have found short shrift indeed, fire\r\nand the stake, in Puritan England under Cromwell, or in Calvinistic\r\nScotland had his practices been even dimly guessed at by the Kirk. As Dr.\r\nArendzen well says[59]: “Albigensianism was not really a heresy against\r\nChristianity and the Catholic Church, it was a revolt against nature, a\r\npestilential perversion of human instinct.”\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the nineteenth century a _Neo-Gnostic Church_ was\r\nformed by Fabre des Essarts, but that great pontiff Leo XIII promptly\r\ncondemned it with fitting severity as a recrudescence of the old\r\nAlbigensian heresy, complicated by the addition of new false and impious\r\ndoctrines. It is said still to have a number of unhappy adherents.\r\nThese Neo-Gnostics believe that the world is created by Satan, who is a\r\npowerful rival to the omnipotence of God. They also preach a dangerous\r\ncommunism, speciously masqued under some such titles as the “Brotherhood\r\nof Man” or the “Brotherhood of Nations.”\r\n\r\nIn 1900, after a letter from Joanny Bricaud,[60] the patriarch of\r\nuniversal Gnosticism at Lyons, where, in 1913, he was residing at 8, rue\r\nBugeaud, the Neo-Gnostics joined with the Valentinians, a union approved\r\nby their pseudo-Council of Toulouse in 1903. But some years later Dr.\r\nFugairon of Lyons, who adopted the name of Sophronius, amalgamated all\r\nthe branches, with the exception of the Valentinians, under the name\r\nof the _Gnostic Church of Lyons_. These, however, although excluded,\r\ncontinued to follow their own way of salvation, and in 1906 formally\r\naddressed a legal declaration to the Republican Government defending\r\ntheir religious rights of association. Truly might Huysmans tell us that\r\nSatanism flourished at Lyons, “où toutes les hérésies survivent,” “where\r\nevery heresy pullulates and is green.” These Gnostic assemblies are\r\ncomposed of “perfected ones,” male and female. The modern Valentinians,\r\nit is said, have a form of spiritual marriage, bestowing the name\r\nof Helen upon the mystic bride. The original founder of this sect,\r\nValentinus, was, according to S. Epiphanius (_Hæresis_ XXXI) born in\r\nEgypt, and educated at Alexandria. His errors led to excommunication and\r\nhe died in Cyprus, about A.D. 160-161. His heresy is a fantastic medley\r\nof Greek and Oriental speculation, tinged with some vague colouring of\r\nChristianity. The Christology of Valentinus is especially confused. He\r\nseems to have supposed the existence of three redeemers, but Christ, the\r\nSon of Mary, did not have a real body and did not suffer. Even his more\r\nprominent disciples, Heracleon, Ptolemy, Marcos, and Bardesanes, widely\r\ndiffered from their master, as from one another. Many of the writings\r\nof these Gnostics, and a large number of excerpts from Valentinus’s own\r\nworks yet survive.\r\n\r\nOne or two writers of the nineteenth century remarked that there seemed\r\nto be some connexion between certain points of the Sabbat ceremonial and\r\nthe rites of various pagan deities, which is, of course, a perfectly\r\ncorrect observation. For we have seen that Witchcraft as it existed in\r\nEurope from the eleventh century was mainly the spawn of Gnostic heresy,\r\nand heresy by its very nature embraced and absorbed much of heathendom.\r\nIn some sense Witchcraft was a descendant of the old pre-Christian magic,\r\nbut it soon assumed a slightly different form, or rather at the advent\r\nof Christianity it was exposed and shown in its real foul essence as the\r\nworship of the Evil Principle, the Enemy of Mankind, Satan.\r\n\r\nIt may freely be acknowledged that there are certain symbols common to\r\nChristianity itself and to ancient religions. It would in truth be very\r\nsurprising if, when seeking to propagate her doctrines in the midst of\r\nGræco-Roman civilization, the Church had adopted for her intercourse with\r\nthe people a wholly unknown language, and had systematically repudiated\r\neverything that until then had served to give expression to religious\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits imposed by the conventions of race and culture, the\r\nmethod of interpreting the emotions of the heart cannot be indefinitely\r\nvaried, and it was natural that the new religion should appropriate and\r\nincorporate all that was good in a ritual much of which only required\r\nto be rightly interpreted and directed to become the language of the\r\nChristian soul aspiring to the one True God. Certain attitudes of\r\nprayer and reverence, the use of incense and of lamps burning day and\r\nnight in the sanctuary, the offering of ex-votos as a testimony to\r\nbenefits received, all these are man’s natural expressions of piety and\r\ngratitude towards a divine power, and it would be strange indeed if their\r\nequivalents were not met with in all religions.\r\n\r\nCicero tells us that at Agrigentum there was a much-venerated statue\r\nof Hercules, of which the mouth and chin were worn away by the many\r\nworshippers who pressed their lips to it.[61] The bronze foot of the\r\nstatue of the first Pope, S. Peter, in Rome has not withstood any\r\nbetter the pious kisses of the faithful. Yet he were a very fool who\r\nimagined that modern Christians have learned anything from the Sicilian\r\ncontemporaries of Verres. What is true is that the same thought in\r\nanalogous circumstances has found natural expression after an interval of\r\ncenturies in identical actions and attitudes.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks, heroes, reputed to be the mortal sons of some divinity,\r\nwere specially honoured in the city with which they were connected by\r\nbirth and through the benefits they had conferred upon it. After death\r\nthey became the patrons and protectors of these towns. Every country,\r\nnay, almost every village, had such local divinities to whom monuments\r\nwere raised and whom the people invoked in their prayers. The centre\r\nof devotion was generally the hero’s tomb, which was often erected in\r\nthe middle of the agora, the nave of public life. In most cases it was\r\nsheltered by a building, a sort of chapel known as ἡρῷον. The celebrated\r\ntemples, too, were not infrequently adorned with a great number of\r\ncenotaphs of heroes, just as the shrines of Saints are honoured in\r\nChristian churches.[62] More, the translations of the bones or ashes\r\nof heroes were common in Greece. Thus in the archonship of Apsephion,\r\n469 B.C., the remains of Theseus were brought from Scyros to Athens,\r\nand carried into the city amid sacrifices and every demonstration of\r\ntriumphal joy.[63] Thebes recovered from Ilion the bones of Hector, and\r\npresented to Athens those of Œdipus, to Lebadea those of Arcesilaus, and\r\nto Megara those of Aigialeus.[64]\r\n\r\nThe analogy between these ancient practices and Christianity may be\r\npushed further yet. Just as, in our own churches, objects that have\r\nbelonged to the Saints are exposed for the veneration of the faithful, so\r\nin the old temples visitors were shown divers curiosities whose connexion\r\nwith a god or a hero would command their respect. At Minihi Tréguier we\r\nmay reverence a fragment of the Breviary of S. Yves, at Sens the stole\r\nof S. Thomas of Canterbury, at Bayeux the chasuble of S. Regnobert, in\r\nS. Maria Maggiore the cincture and veil of S. Scholastica; so in various\r\nlocalities of Greece were exhibited the cittara of Paris, the lyre of\r\nOrpheus, portions of the ships of Agamemnon and Æneas. Can anything\r\nfurther be needed to prove that the veneration of Holy Relics is merely a\r\npagan survival?\r\n\r\nSuperficially the theory seems plausible enough, and yet it will not\r\nstand a moment before the judgement of history. The cultus of the\r\nSaints and their Relics is not an outcome of ancient hero-worship, but\r\nof reverence for the Martyrs, and this can be demonstrated without any\r\npossibility of question. So here we have two very striking parallels,\r\neach of which has an analogous starting-point, two cults which naturally\r\ndevelop upon logical and similar lines, but without any interdependence\r\nwhatsoever. Needless to say, the unbalanced folklorist, who is in general\r\nfar too insufficiently equipped for any such inquiry, has rushed in with\r\nhis theories—to his own utter undoing. And so, with regard to Witchcraft,\r\nthere appear in the rites of the Sabbat and other hellish superstitions\r\nto be ceremonies which are directly derived from heathendom, but this, as\r\na matter of fact, is far from the case. Accordingly we recognize that the\r\nthesis of Miss M. A. Murray in her anthropological study _The Witch-Cult\r\nn Western Europe_,[65] although worked out with nice ingenuity and no\r\nlittle documentation, is radically and wholly erroneous. Miss Murray\r\nactually postulates that “underlying the Christian religion was a cult\r\npractised by many classes of the community” which “can be traced back\r\nto pre-Christian times, and appears to be the ancient religion of\r\nWestern Europe.” We are given a full account of the chief festivals of\r\nthis imaginary cult, of its hierarchy, its organization, and many other\r\ndetails. The feasts and dances—the obscene horrors of the Sabbat—“show\r\nthat it was a joyous religion”! It is impossible to conceive a more\r\namazing assertion. Miss Murray continues to say that “as such it must\r\nhave been quite incomprehensible to the gloomy Inquisitors and Reformers\r\nwho suppressed it.” The Reformers, for all their dour severity, perfectly\r\nwell appreciated with what they were dealing, and the Inquisitors, the\r\nsons of S. Dominic who was boundless in his charity and of S. Francis,\r\nwhose very name breathes Christ-like love to all creation, were men of\r\nthe profoundest knowledge and deepest sympathies, whose first duty it\r\nwas to stamp out the infection lest the whole of Society be corrupted\r\nand damned. Miss Murray does not seem to suspect that Witchcraft was\r\nin truth a foul and noisome heresy, the poison of the Manichees. Her\r\n“Dianic cult,” which name she gives to this “ancient religion” supposed\r\nto have survived until the Middle Ages and even later and to have been\r\na formidable rival to Christianity, is none other than black heresy and\r\nthe worship of Satan, no primitive belief with pre-agricultural rites,\r\nin latter days persecuted, misinterpreted, and misunderstood. It is\r\ntrue that in the Middle Ages Christianity had—not a rival but a foe,\r\nthe eternal enemy of the Church Militant against whom she yet contends\r\nto-day, the dark Lord of that city which is set contrariwise to the City\r\nof God, the Terrible Shadow of destruction and despair.\r\n\r\nMiss Murray with tireless industry has accumulated a vast number of\r\ndetails by the help of which she seeks to build up and support her\r\nimaginative thesis. Even those that show the appropriation by the cult\r\nof evil of the more hideous heathen practices, both of lust and cruelty,\r\nwhich prevailed among savage or decadent peoples, afford no evidence\r\nwhatsoever of any continuity of an earlier religion, whilst by far\r\nthe greater number of the facts she quotes are deflected, although\r\nno doubt unconsciously, and sharply wrested so as to be patent of the\r\nsignification it is endeavoured to read into them. Miss Murray speaks,\r\nfor example, of witches “who, like the early Christian martyrs, rushed\r\nheadlong on their fate, determined to die for their faith and their\r\nGod.”[66] And later, discussing the “Sacrifice of the God,” a theme which\r\nit is interesting and by no means impertinent to note, folklorists have\r\nelaborated in the most fanciful manner, basing upon the scantiest and\r\nquite contradictory evidence an abundant sheaf of wildly extravagant\r\ntheories and fables, she tells us that the burning of witches at the\r\nhands of the public executioner was a “sacrifice of the incarnate\r\ndeity.”[67] One might almost suppose that the condemned went cheerfully\r\nand voluntarily to the cruellest and most torturing punishment, for\r\nthe phrase “Self-devotion to death” is used in this connexion. On the\r\ncontrary, we continually find in the witch-trials that the guilty, as\r\nwas natural, sought to escape from their doom by any and every means;\r\nby flight, as in the case of Gilles de Sillé and Roger de Bricqueville,\r\ncompanions of Gilles de Rais; by long and protracted defences, such as\r\nwas that of Agnes Fynnie, executed in Edinburgh in 1644; by threats and\r\nblackmail of influential patrons owing to which old Bettie Laing of\r\nPittenween escaped scot-free in 1718; by pleading pregnancy at the trial\r\nas did Mother Samuel, the Warbois witch, who perished on the gallows 7\r\nApril, 1593; by suicide as the notorious warlock John Reid, who hanged\r\nhimself in prison at Paisley, in 1697.\r\n\r\nOf the theoretical “Sacrifice of the incarnate deity” Miss Murray writes:\r\n“This explanation accounts for the fact that the bodies of witches, male\r\nor female, were always burnt and the ashes scattered; for the strong\r\nprejudice which existed, as late as the eighteenth century, against any\r\nother mode of disposing of their bodies; and for some of the otherwise\r\ninexplicable occurrences in connexion with the deaths of certain of the\r\nvictims.”[68] Three instances are cited to prove these three statements,\r\nbut it will be seen upon examination that not one of these affords the\r\nslightest evidence in support of the triple contention. In the first\r\nplace we are informed that “in the light of this theory much of the\r\nmystery which surrounds the fate of Joan of Arc is explained.” How\r\nis not divulged, but this is capped by the astounding and indecorous\r\nassertion that S. Joan of Arc “belonged to the ancient religion, not to\r\nthe Christian.” It is superfluous to say that there is not a tittle of\r\nevidence for such an amazing hypothesis in reference to the Saint.\r\n\r\nGilles de Rais, whose execution is next quoted by Miss Murray in support\r\nof her postulate, proves a singularly unfortunate example. We are told\r\nthat “like Joan he was willing to be tried for his faith,” by which is\r\nmeant the imaginary “Dianic cult.” This is a purely gratuitous assertion,\r\nnot borne out in any way by his behaviour at his trial, nor by the\r\ndetails of any authoritative account or report of the proceedings. Gilles\r\nde Rais was hanged on a gibbet above a pyre, but when the heat had burned\r\nthrough the rope the body was quickly taken up from the blazing wood, and\r\nafterwards buried in the neighbouring Carmelite church. One may compare\r\nthe execution of Savonarola and his two fellow friars on 25 May, 1498.\r\nThey were strangled at the gallows, their bodies committed to the flames,\r\nand their ashes carefully gathered and thrown into the Arno. Gilles de\r\nRais was condemned by three distinct courts; by the Holy Inquisition,\r\nthe presidents being Jean de Malestroit, Bishop of Nantes, and Jean\r\nBlouyn, vice-inquisitor, O.P., S.T.M., on charges of heresy and sorcery;\r\nby the episcopal court on charges of sacrilege and the violation of\r\necclesiastical rights; by the civil court of John V, Duke of Brittany, on\r\nmultiplied charges of murder.\r\n\r\nThe third case quoted by Miss Murray is that of Major Weir, who “offered\r\nhimself up and was executed as a witch in Edinburgh.” Thomas Weir, who\r\nwas a hypocritical Puritan, a leader “among the Presbyterian strict\r\nsect,” and regarded as a Saint throughout Edinburgh, had all the while\r\nsecretly led a life of hideous debauchery and was stained with the most\r\nodious and unnatural crimes. In 1670, which was the seventieth year of\r\nhis age, he appears to have been stricken with terrible fits of remorse\r\nand despair; the pangs of his guilty conscience drove him to the verge of\r\nmadness and his agony could only be eased by a full, ample, and public\r\nconfession of his misdeeds. For a few months his party, in order to avoid\r\nthe scandal and disgrace, contrived to stifle the matter, but a minister\r\n“whom they esteemed more forward than wise” revealed the secret to the\r\nLord Provost of the city, and an inquiry was instituted. The wretched old\r\nman, insistently declaring that “the terrors of God which were upon his\r\nsoul urged him to confess and accuse himself,” was arrested, together\r\nwith his crazy sister Jean, who was implicated in his abominations. “All\r\nthe while he was in prison he lay under violent apprehension of the\r\nheavy wrath of God, which put him into that which is properly called\r\ndespair,” and to various ministers who visited him he declared, “I know\r\nmy sentence of damnation is already sealed in Heaven ... for I find\r\nnothing within me but blackness, darkness, Brimstone, and burning to the\r\nbottom of Hell.”[69] The whole account gives a complete and perfectly\r\ncomprehensible psychological study. So sudden a revulsion of feeling, the\r\nloathing of foul acts accompanied by the sheer inability to repent of\r\nthem, is quite understandable in a septuagenarian, worn out in body by\r\nyears of excess and enfeebled in mind owing to the heavy strain of hourly\r\nacting an artificial and difficult rôle. The intense emotionalism of the\r\ndegenerate has not infrequently been observed eventually to give way to\r\na state of frenzied anguish, for which the alienist Magnan coined the\r\nname “Anxiomania,” a species of mental derangement that soon drives the\r\npatient to hysterical confession and boundless despair. “I am convinced,”\r\nsays one writer with regard to Major Weir, “of the prisoner having\r\nbeen delirious at the time of his trial.”[70] His sister frantically\r\naccused her brother of Witchcraft, but it is remarkable that in his case\r\nthis charge was not taken up and examined. I do not say that Weir was\r\nnot supposed to be a warlock; as a matter of fact he was notoriously\r\nreputed such, and strange stories were told of his magic staff and other\r\nenchantments, but Witchcraft was not the main accusation brought against\r\nhim in the official courts. He was found guilty of adultery, fornication,\r\nincest, and bestiality, and on these several counts sentenced to be\r\nstrangled at a stake betwixt Edinburgh and Leith, on Monday, 11 April,\r\n1670, and his body to be burned to ashes. Jean Weir was condemned for\r\nincest and Witchcraft and hanged on 12 April in the Grassmarket at\r\nEdinburgh. To the last this miserable lunatic placed “a great deal of\r\nconfidence in her constant adherence to the Covenant, which she called\r\n_the cause and interest of Christ_.”[71]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Miss Murray’s citation is incorrect and therefore\r\nimpertinent. Major Weir was not executed “as a witch.” Moreover, both\r\nhe and Gilles de Rais were actually strangled, and such examples must\r\nentirely fail to account “for the fact that the bodies of witches, male\r\nor female, were always burnt and the ashes scattered,” especially since\r\nin the latter case, as we have noticed, the body was honourably buried in\r\nthe church of the Whitefriars. In fine, to endeavour to connect, however\r\ningeniously, the fate of S. Joan of Arc, the execution of Gilles de Rais\r\nand Major Weir, with the folklorists’ theory of “the sacrifice of the\r\nincarnate deity” is merest fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the whole matter lies elsewhere. Death at the stake was the\r\npunishment reserved for heretics. As we have already noticed, Diocletian\r\nruthlessly burned the Manichees: “We order then that the professors and\r\nteachers be punished with the utmost penalties, which is to say they\r\nare to be burned with fire together with all their execrable books and\r\nwritings.”[72] The Visigoth code condemned pagans or heretics who had\r\ncommitted sacrilege to the flames, and together with them it grouped all\r\nManichees: “It is known that many Proconsuls have thrown blasphemers to\r\nthe beasts, nay, have even burned some alive.”[73] The Visigoth code of\r\nRekeswinth (652-672) punishes Judaizers with death, “aut lapide puniatur,\r\naut igne cremetur.” (Let them be stoned or burned with fire.) But it was\r\nactually in the eleventh century that the civil power first generally\r\nordained the penalty of the stake for the heretics, who were, it must\r\nalways be remembered, mad anarchists endeavouring to destroy all social\r\norder, authority, and decency. “In Italy even many adherents of this\r\npestilential belief were found, and these wretches were slain with the\r\nsword or burned at the stake,”[74] writes Adhémar de Chabannes, a monk\r\nof Angoulême, about the middle of the eleventh century. In a letter of\r\nWazon, Bishop of Liège, there is an allusion to similar punishments which\r\nwere being inflicted in Flanders.\r\n\r\nA striking example of the heretical anarchists who troubled Europe about\r\nthe beginning of the twelfth century may be seen in Tanchelin[75] and\r\nhis followers. This fanatic, who was originally a native of Zealand,\r\njourneyed throughout Flanders preaching his monstrous doctrines\r\neverywhere he could find listeners and especially concentrating upon\r\nthe city of Antwerp. In 1108 and 1109 he appeared at Arras and Cambrai,\r\npersuading many evil and ignorant persons to accept his abominable\r\ntenets. The tares were thickly sown, and it is terribly significant that\r\nsome three centuries later, about 1469, there was a fearful epidemic of\r\nsorcery throughout the whole district of the Artois, in reference to\r\nwhich the anonymous author—probably an Inquisitor—of a contemporary work\r\nentitled _Erreurs des Gazariens ou de ceux que l’on prouve chevaucher\r\nsur un balai ou un bâton_ expressly identified such heretics as the\r\nGazariens, who are Cathari, and the Vaudois (Poor Lombards) with warlocks\r\nand sorcerers. In 1112 Tanchelin, who had actually visited Rome itself,\r\nwas upon his return arrested and thrown into prison at Cologne, whence,\r\nhowever, he managed to escape, and accompanied by an apostate priest\r\nEverwacher and a Jew Manasses, who had formerly been a blacksmith, at\r\nthe head of a formidable band of three thousand ruffians, outlaws, cast\r\ngamesters, brigands, murderers, beggars and thieves, the parbreak of\r\nevery slum and stew, he terrorized the whole countryside, the people\r\nbeing afraid, the bishops and secular princes seemingly unable to resist\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of Tanchelin was, as might be expected, largely incoherent\r\nand illogical, the ravings of a frantic brain, but none the less\r\ndangerous and wholly abominable. The Church was, of course, directly\r\nattacked and blasphemed. With abuse and foul language, extraordinarily\r\nlike the language of the so-called Reformers in the sixteenth century,\r\nthe hierarchy and all ecclesiastical order were repudiated and\r\ncontemned, priests and religious in particular were to be persecuted\r\nand exterminated since the priesthood was a fiction and a snare; the\r\nSacrifice of Holy Mass was a mockery, all Sacraments were void and empty\r\nforms, useless for salvation[76]; the churches themselves were to be\r\naccounted as brothels and markets of shame. “This very spawn of Satan\r\nand black angel of woe declared that the churches, dedicated to God’s\r\nworship, were bawdy-houses. That, at Holy Mass there was no Sacrifice\r\nat the hands of the priest; the Service of the Altar was filth, not a\r\nSacrament.”[77] Tanchelin declared himself to be the Messiah, God, the\r\nSon of God, the Perfect Man, the sum of all the divine emanations in one\r\nsystem, upon whom had descended and in whom abode the pleroma of the Holy\r\nSpirit. “This miserable wretch advanced from evil to evil and at length\r\nproceeded to such an extremity of unheard-of wickedness that he gave\r\nhimself out to be God, asserting that if Christ be God because the Holy\r\nGhost dwelt in Him, he himself was not less than and of the same nature\r\nas God, seeing that he enjoyed the plenitude of the Holy Ghost.”[78] Here\r\nthe Gnostic character of his teaching is very apparent. He even caused a\r\ntemple to be erected in his honour where he was worshipped with sacrifice\r\nand hymns. His followers, indeed, regarded this lunatic wretch with such\r\nan excess of veneration that the dirty water from his bath was actually\r\ncollected in phials and solemnly distributed among them, whereof they\r\npartook as of a sacrament.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that Tanchelin’s programme did not solely\r\ncomprise a negation of Christian dogma; this we find in most of the\r\ninnovators at the time of the so-called Reformation, but his ultimate\r\naim was to effect a social revolution, to overturn the existing order\r\nof things and produce communistic chaos with himself as overlord\r\nand dictator. The way for anarchy could only have been paved by the\r\ndestruction of the Church, the supreme representative of authority and\r\norder throughout the world, and it was accordingly against the Church\r\nthat this superman launched his fiercest diatribes. To further his ends\r\nhe encouraged, nay, commanded, the open practice of the foulest vices;\r\nincest, adultery, fornication were declared to be works of spiritual\r\nefficacy; unmentionable abominations flaunted themselves in the face\r\nof day; virtue became an offence; men were driven to vice and crime,\r\nand anon they gradually sank in a stupor of infamy and sheer boneless\r\ndegradation.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate town of Antwerp came directly under Tanchelin’s\r\ninfluence. Here he reigned as king, surrounded by vile and obsequious\r\nsatellites who ground the miserable citizens to the dust and filled each\r\nstreet and corner with orgies of lust and blood. There is a strange and\r\nstriking parallel between the details of his foul career and the Russian\r\ntyranny to-day. Little wonder that in 1116 a priest, maddened by the\r\noutrages and profanities of this hellish crew, scattered the heretic’s\r\nbrains upon the deck of his royal barge as one afternoon he was sailing\r\nin pompous state down the river Schelde: “After a life of infamy,\r\nbloodshed, and heresy, whilst he was sailing on the river he was struck\r\non the head by a certain priest and falling down died there.”[79] All\r\nunfortunately, however, the pernicious errors of Tanchelin did not expire\r\nwith their author. Antwerp remained plunged in dissipation and riot, and\r\nalthough strenuous efforts were made to restore decency and order, at\r\nfirst these seemed to be entirely nugatory and fruitless. Burchard, the\r\nBishop of Cambrai, at once sent twelve of his most revered and learned\r\ncanons under the conduct of Hidolphe, a priest of acknowledged sagacity\r\nand experience, to endeavour to reform the town by word and example, but\r\nit seemed as though their efforts were doomed to failure and ill-success.\r\nAt length, almost in despair, the good prelate begged S. Norbert,[80] who\r\nsome three years before had founded his Order at Prémontré, to essay the\r\nthankless and wellnigh impossible task. Without demur or hesitation the\r\nSaint cheerfully undertook so difficult a mission and accompanied only by\r\nS. Evermonde,[81] and Blessed Waltman, together with a few more of his\r\nmost fervent followers he arrived at Antwerp without delay to begin his\r\nwork there towards the end of 1123. Success at once crowned his efforts;\r\nin an incredibly short space of time the people confessed their errors,\r\nabuses were reformed, the leprous town cleansed of its foulness, public\r\nsafety, order, and decorum once again established, and, what is extremely\r\nstriking to notice, the old chroniclers draw attention to the fact that\r\na large number both of men and women in deepest penitence brought to S.\r\nNorbert quantities of consecrated Hosts which they had purloined from\r\nthe tabernacles and kept concealed in boxes and other hiding-places to\r\nutilize for charms and evil invocations, to profane in devil-worship and\r\nat the Sabbat. So marvellous was the change from darkness to light that\r\nyear by year the Premonstratensian Order upon the Saturday[82] after the\r\nOctave of Corpus Christi solemnly observes a fitting memorial thereof in\r\nthe glad Feast of the Triumph of Holy Father Norbert.\r\n\r\nIn this incident of the stolen Hosts the connexion between Gnostic\r\nheresy and Satanism is clearly seen. It was in such soil as the\r\nantinomianism of Tanchelin that the poisoned weeds of sorcery would\r\nthrive apace. The authorities recognized that drastic measures must be\r\nemployed, and at Bonn a company of impure fanatics who attempted to\r\ndisseminate his ideas were incontinently sent to the stake.\r\n\r\nThe other arguments brought forward by Miss Murray to support her thesis\r\nof the continuity of a primitive religion are mainly “the persistence\r\nof the number thirteen in the Covens, the narrow geographical range\r\nof the domestic familiar, the avoidance of certain forms in the\r\nanimal transformations, the limited number of personal names among\r\nthe women-witches, and the survival of the names of some of the early\r\ngods.”[83] Even if these details could be proved up to the hilt and\r\nshown to be pertinent the evidence were not convincing; it would at best\r\npoint to some odd survivals, such as are familiar in an hundred ways to\r\nevery student of hagiography, history, myths and legends, old religions,\r\ngeography, iconography, topography, etymology, anthropology, and\r\nantiquarian lore in a myriad branches. If we examine the matter broadly\r\nwe shall find that these circumstances are for the most part local, not\r\ngeneral, that in many instances they cannot be clearly substantiated, for\r\nthe evidence is conflicting and obscure.\r\n\r\n“The ‘fixed number’ among the witches of Great Britain,” Miss Murray\r\nnotes, “seems to have been thirteen,”[84] and certainly in many cases\r\namongst the English trials the coven appears to have consisted of\r\nthirteen members, although it may be borne in mind that very probably\r\nthere were often other associates who were not traced and involved and\r\nso escaped justice. Yet Miss Murray does not explain why the number\r\nthirteen should form any link with an earlier ritual and worship. On the\r\nother hand, the demonologists are never tired of insisting that Satan is\r\nthe ape of God in all things, and that the worshippers of evil delight\r\nto parody every divine ordinance and institution. The explanation is\r\nsimple. The number thirteen was adopted by the witches for their covens\r\nin mockery of Our Lord and His Apostles.\r\n\r\n“The narrow geographical range of the domestic familiar” is not at all\r\napparent, and it were futile to base any presumption upon so slender\r\na line of argument. “The avoidance of certain forms in the animal\r\ntransformation” is upon a general view of Witchcraft found to be nothing\r\nother than the non-occurrence of the lamb and the dove, and these two\r\nwere abhorred by sorcerers, seeing that Christ is the Lamb of God, Agnus\r\nDei, whilst the Dove is the manifestation of the Holy Ghost.[85] There is\r\none instance, the trial of Agnes Wobster at Aberdeen in 1597, when the\r\nDevil is said to have appeared to the witch “in the liknes of a lamb,\r\nquhom thou callis thy God, and bletit on the, and thaireftir spak to\r\nthe.”[86] But this rare exception must be understood to be a black and\r\ndeformed lamb, not the snow-white Agnus Dei. In pictures of the Doctors\r\nof the Church, particularly perhaps S. Gregory the Great and S. Alphonsus\r\nde Liguori, the Dove is seen breathing divine inspiration into the ear\r\nof the Saint who writes the heavenly message, thus directly given by God\r\nthe Holy Ghost. So in a Franco-German miniature of the eleventh century\r\nin the _Hortus Deliciarum_ we see a black hideous bird breathing into the\r\near of a magician thoughts evil and dark. This cloudy and sombre spirit,\r\nviolent in its attitude and lean in body stretches its meagre throat\r\ntowards the ear of the wicked man, who, seated at a desk, transcribes\r\nupon a parchment the malevolent and baleful charms which it dictates. It\r\nis in fact the Devil.[87]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the argument based upon “the limited number of personal\r\nnames among the women-witches” this simply resolves itself into the fact\r\nthat in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there were in general\r\nuse (particularly amongst the peasantry) far fewer personal names than\r\nhave been employed of more recent years. To assert “that the name\r\n_Christian_ clearly indicates the presence of another religion”[88] is\r\nsimple nonsense. It may be noticed, too, how many of the names which\r\nMiss Murray has catalogued in such conscientious and alas! impertinent\r\ndetail are those of well-known Saints whose cult was universal throughout\r\nEurope: Agnes, Alice, Anne, Barbara, Christopher, Collette, Elizabeth,\r\nGiles, Isabel, James, John, Katherine, Lawrence, Margaret, Mary, Michael,\r\nPatrick, Thomas, Ursula—and the list might be almost indefinitely\r\nprolonged.\r\n\r\n“The survival of the names of some of the early gods” is also asserted.\r\nIn connexion with Witchcraft, however, very few examples of this can\r\nbe traced even by the most careful research. An old charm or two, a\r\nnonsense rhyme, may now and again repeat some forgotten meaningless word\r\nor refrain. Thus in a spell used by the witches of the Basses-Pyrénées,\r\ncited by De Lancre (1609), we find mention of the old Basque deity\r\nJanicot: “In nomine patrica, Aragueaco Petrica, Gastellaco Ianicot,\r\nEquidæ ipordian pot.” Bodin gives a dance-jingle, “Har, har, diable,\r\ndiable, saute icy, saute là, ioüe icy, ioüe là,” to which the chorus\r\nwas “sabath sabath.” Miss Murray tells us that the Guernsey version\r\n“which is currently reported to be used at the present day,” runs: “Har,\r\nhar, Hon, Hon, danse ici.”[89] Hon was an old Breton god, and there are\r\nstill remote districts whose local names recall and may be compounded\r\nwith that of this ancient deity. It is significant that in one case we\r\nhave a Basque deity, in the other a Breton; for Basque and Breton are\r\nnearly, if obscurely, correlated. Such traces are interesting enough,\r\nbut by no means unique, hardly singular indeed, since they can be so\r\nwidely paralleled, and it were idle to base any elaborate argument\r\nconcerning the continuity of a fully organized cult upon slight and\r\nunrelated survivals in dialect place-names and the mere doggerel lilt of\r\na peasant-song.\r\n\r\nThere is in particular one statement advanced by Miss Murray which goes\r\nfar to show how in complete unconsciousness she is fitting her material\r\nto her theory. She writes: “There is at present nothing to show how much\r\nof the Witches’ Mass (in which the bread, the wine, and the candles were\r\nblack) derived from the Christian ritual and how much belonged to the\r\nDianic cult [the name given to this hypothetical but universal ancient\r\nreligion]; it is, however, possible that the witches’ service was the\r\nearlier form and influenced the Christian.”[90] This last sentence is in\r\ntruth an amazing assertion. A more flagrant case of hysteron-proteron\r\nis hardly imaginable. So self-evident is the absurdity that it refutes\r\nitself, and one can only suppose that the words were allowed to remain\r\nowing to their having been overlooked in the revision of a long and\r\ndifficult study, a venial negligence. Every prayer and every gesture\r\nof Holy Mass, since the first Mass was celebrated upon the first\r\nMaundy Thursday, has been studied in minutest detail by generations of\r\nliturgiologists and ceremonialists, whose library is almost infinite\r\nin its vastness and extent from the humblest pamphlets to the hugest\r\nfolios. We can trace each inspired development, when such an early phrase\r\nwas added, when such a hallowed sign was first made at such words in such\r\nan orison. The witches’ service is a hideous burlesque of Holy Mass, and,\r\nbriefly, what Miss Murray suggests is that the parody may have existed\r\nbefore the thing parodied. It is true that some topsy-turvy writers\r\nhave actually proclaimed that magic preceded religion, but this view\r\nis generally discredited by the authorities of all schools. Sir James\r\nFrazer, Sir A. L. Lyall, and Mr. F. B. Jevons, for example, recognize “a\r\nfundamental distinction and even opposition of principle between magic\r\nand religion.”[91]\r\n\r\nIn fine, upon a candid examination of this theory of the continuity of\r\nsome primitive religion, which existed as an underlying organization\r\nmanifested in Witchcraft and sorcery, a serious rival feared and hated\r\nby the Church, we find that nothing of the sort ever survived, that\r\nthere was no connexion between sorcery and an imaginary “Dianic cult.”\r\nTo write that “in the fifteenth century open war was declared against\r\nthe last remains of heathenism in the famous Bull of Innocent VIII”[92]\r\nis to ignore history. As has been emphasized above, the Bull _Summis\r\ndesiderantes affectibus_ of 1484 was only one of a long series of Papal\r\nordinances directed against an intolerable evil not heathenism indeed,\r\nbut heresy. For heresy, sorcery, and anarchy were almost interchangeable\r\nwords, and the first Bull launched directly against the black art was\r\nthat of Alexander IV, 1258, two hundred and twenty-six years before.\r\n\r\nThat here and there lingered various old harmless customs and festivities\r\nwhich had come down from pre-Christian times and which the Church had\r\nallowed, nay, had even sanctified by directing them to their right\r\nsource, the Maypole dances, for example, and the Midsummer fires which\r\nnow honour S. John Baptist, is a matter of common knowledge. But this is\r\nno continuance of a pagan cult.\r\n\r\nFrom the first centuries of the Christian era, throughout the Middle\r\nAges, and continuously to the present day there has invariably been an\r\nopen avowal of intentional evil-doing on the part of the devotees of the\r\nwitch-cult, and the more mischief they did the more they pleased their\r\nlord and master. Their revels were loathly, lecherous, and abominable, a\r\nSabbat where every circumstance of horror and iniquity found expression.\r\nThis in itself is an argument against Miss Murray’s theory, as none of\r\nthe earlier religions existed for the express purpose of perpetrating\r\nevil for evil’s sake. We have but to read the eloquent and exquisite\r\ndescription of the Eleusinian Mysteries by that accomplished Greek\r\nscholar Father Cyril Martindale, S.J.,[93] to catch no mean nor mistaken\r\nglimpse of the ineffable yearning for beauty, for purity, for holiness,\r\nwhich filled the hearts of the worshippers of the goddess Persephoneia,\r\nwhose stately and impressive ritual prescribing fasts, bathing in\r\nthe waters of the sea, self-discipline, self-denial, self-restraint,\r\nculminated in the Hall of Initiation, hallowed by the Earth-Mother,\r\nDemeter, where the symbolic drama of life, death, and resurrection was\r\nshown by the Hierophant to those who had wrestled, and endured, and were\r\nadjudged worthy. How fair a shadow was this, albeit always and ever a\r\nshadow, of the imperishable and eternal realities to come! How different\r\nthese Mysteries from the foul orgies of witches, the Sabbat, the black\r\nmass, the adoration of hell.\r\n\r\nIn truth it was not against heathenism that Innocent VIII sounded the\r\nnote of war, but against heresy. There was a clandestine organization\r\nhated by the Church, and this was not sorcery nor any cult of witches\r\nrenewing and keeping green some ancient rites and pagan creed, but a\r\nwitch-cult that identified itself with and was continually manifested in\r\nclosest connexion with Gnosticism in its most degraded and vilest shapes.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious little piece of symbolism, as it may be, which has\r\npassed into the patois of the Pyrenees. Wizards are commonly known as\r\n_poudouès_ and witches _poudouèros_, both words being derived from\r\n_putere_, which signifies to have an evil smell. The demonologists\r\nreport, and it was commonly believed, that sorcerers could often be\r\ndetected by their foul and fetid odour. Hagiographers tell that S.\r\nPhilip Neri could distinguish heretics by their smell, and often he was\r\nobliged to turn away his head when meeting them in the street. The same\r\nis recorded of many other Saints, and this tradition is interesting\r\nas it serves to show the close connexion there was held to be between\r\nmagic and heresy.[94] Saint Pachomius, the cenobite, could distinguish\r\nheretics by their insupportable stench; the abbot Eugendis could tell\r\nthe virtues and vices of those whom he met by the perfume or the stink.\r\nSaint Hilarion, as S. Jerome relates, could even distinguish a man’s sins\r\nby the smell of a warm garment or cloak. Blessed Dominica of Paradise,\r\npassing a soldier in the street, knew by the foul smell that he had\r\nabandoned the faith, to which, however, her fervid exhortations and\r\nprayers eventually restored him. Saint Bridget of Sweden was wellnigh\r\nsuffocated by the fetor of a notorious sinner who addressed her. Saint\r\nCatherine of Siena experienced the same sensations; whilst Saint\r\nLutgarde, a Cistercian nun, on meeting a vicious reprobate perceived a\r\ndecaying smell of leprosy and disease.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Saints themselves have diffused sweetest\r\nfragrances, and actually “the odour of sanctity” is more than a mere\r\nphrase. One day in 1566, when he had entered the church at Somascha, a\r\nsecluded hamlet between Milan and Bergamo, S. Charles Borromeo exclaimed:\r\n“I know by the heavenly fragrance in this sanctuary that a great Servant\r\nof God lies buried here!” The church, in fact, contained the body of\r\nS. Jerome Emiliani, who died in 1537. S. Herman Joseph could be traced\r\nthrough the corridors of Steinfeld by the rare perfumes he scattered\r\nas he walked. The same was the case with that marvellous mystic S.\r\nJoseph of Cupertino. S. Thomas Aquinas smelt of male frankincense. I\r\nmyself have known a priest of fervent faith who at times diffused the\r\nodour of incense. Maria-Vittoria of Genoa, Ida of Louvain, S. Colette,\r\nS. Humiliana, were fragrant as sweet flowers. S. Francis of Paul and\r\nVenturini of Bergamo scattered heavenly aromas when they offered the Holy\r\nSacrifice. The pus of S. John of the Cross gave forth a strong scent of\r\nlilies.\r\n\r\nMiss Murray has worked out her thesis with no inconsiderable ingenuity,\r\nbut when details are considered, historically examined, and set in their\r\ndue proportions, it must be concluded that the theory of the continuity\r\nof an ancient religion is baseless. Her book is called _A Study in\r\nAnthropology_, and here we can, I think, at once put our finger upon\r\nthe fundamental mistake. Anthropology alone offers no explanation of\r\nWitchcraft. Only the trained theologian can adequately treat the subject.\r\nAn amount of interesting material has been collected, but the key to the\r\ndark mystery could not be found.\r\n\r\nYet, as our investigations have shown, it was not so far to seek.\r\nIn the succinct phrase of that profound and prolific scholar Thomas\r\nStapleton[95]: “Crescit cum magia hæresis, cum hæresi magia.” (The weed\r\nheresy grows alongside the weed witchcraft, the weed witchcraft alongside\r\nthe weed heresy.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n[1] _Paris. Jacques du Puys._ 4to. 1580. The preface, addressed to De\r\nThou, is signed: “De _Laon_, ce xx iour de _Decembre_, M.D.LXXIX.” There\r\nwere nine editions before 1604. The most complete is _Paris_, 4to. 1587.\r\nIn addition to the text it contains ten extra pages only found here\r\ngiving the trial of a sorcerer, Abel de la Rue, executed in 1582.\r\n\r\n[2] The first Papal bull dealing with sorcery was issued by Alexander\r\nIV, 13 December, 1258. The last Papal Constitution concerned with this\r\ncrime is that of Urban VIII, _Inscrutabilis iudiciorum Dei altitudo_,\r\n1 April, 1631. The last regular English trial seems to have been that\r\nof an old woman and her son, acquitted at Leicester in 1717. In 1722\r\nthe last execution of a Scottish witch took place at Loth; both English\r\nand Scottish statutes were repealed in 1735. The Irish Statute was not\r\nrepealed until 1821. At Kempten in Bavaria, a mad heretic, a woman, was\r\nexecuted for sorcery in 1775. In the Swiss canton of Glaris, a wench\r\nnamed Anna Goeldi, was hanged as a witch, 17 June, 1782.

The exact technical distinction\r\nbetween the two terms in ecclesiastical usage may be seen in the phrase\r\nused in the decree of the Fourth Lateran Council[1]: “Diabolus enim et\r\nalii dæmones.” (The devil and the other demons), i.e. all are demons,\r\nand the chief of the demons is called the Devil. This distinction is\r\npreserved in the Vulgate New Testament, where _diabolus_ represents the\r\nGreek διάβολος, and in almost every instance refers to Satan himself,\r\nwhilst his subordinate angels are described, in accordance with the\r\nGreek, as _dæmones_ or _dæmonia_. But save in some highly specialized\r\ncontext when the most meticulous accuracy is required, we now use the\r\nwords “devil,” “demon” indifferently, and employ the definite article to\r\ndenote Lucifer (Satan), chief of the devils, The Devil. So in S. Matthew\r\nxxv. 41, is written “the devil and his angels.” The Greek word διάβολος\r\nmeans a slanderer, an accuser, and in this sense is it applied to him of\r\nwhom it is said “the accuser [ὁ κατήγορος] of our brethren is cast forth,\r\nwho accused them before our God day and night” (Apocalypse xii. 10). Thus\r\nit answers to the Hebrew name Satan, which signifies an adversary, an\r\naccuser.\r\n\r\nMention is made of the Devil in many passages both of the Old and New\r\nTestaments, but much is left in obscurity, and the full Scriptural\r\nteaching on the legions of evil can best be ascertained by combining\r\nthe scattered notices and reading them in the light of patristic and\r\ntheological tradition. The authoritative teaching of the Church is\r\ndeclared in the Decrees of the Fourth Lateran Church (cap. 1. _Firmiter\r\ncredimus_), wherein, after setting forth that God in the beginning had\r\ncreated two creatures, the spiritual and corporeal; that is to say, the\r\nangelic and the earthly, and lastly man, who was made of both earth and\r\nbody; the Council continues: “For the Devil and the other demons were\r\ncreated by God naturally good; but they themselves of themselves became\r\nevil.”[2] The dogma is here clearly laid down that the Devil and the\r\nother demons are spiritual or angelic creatures created by God in a state\r\nof innocence, and that they became evil by their own free act. It is\r\nadded that man sinned by suggestion of the Devil, and that in the next\r\nworld the reprobate and impenitent will suffer punishment with him. This\r\nthen is the actual dogma, the dry bones of the doctrine, so to speak.\r\nBut later theologians have added a great deal to this,—the authoritative\r\nDoctor Eximius, Francisco Suarez, S.J.,[3] _De Angelis_, VII, is\r\nespecially valuable—and much of what they deduce cannot be disputed\r\nwithout such rejection incurring the grave censure technically known as\r\n“Erroneous.”[4]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that for an account of the Fall of the angels, which\r\nhappened before the creation of the world, we must turn to the last book\r\nin the Bible, the Apocalypse of S. John. For although the picture of the\r\npast be blended with prophecies of what shall be in the future, thus\r\nmust we undoubtedly regard the vision of Patmos. “And there was a great\r\nbattle in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the\r\ndragon fought and his angels: and they prevailed not, neither was their\r\nplace found any more in heaven. And that great dragon was cast out, that\r\nold serpent, who is called the Devil, and Satan, who seduceth the whole\r\nworld; and he was cast down unto the earth, and his angels were thrown\r\ndown with him” (Apocalypse xii. 7-9). To this may be added the words of\r\nS. Jude: “And the angels who kept not their principality, but forsook\r\ntheir own habitation, he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting\r\nchains, unto the judgement of the great day.” To these references should\r\nbe added a striking passage from the prophet Isaiah: “How art thou fallen\r\nfrom heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning! how art thou\r\nfallen to the earth, that didst wound the nations! And thou saidst in\r\nthy heart: I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the\r\nstars of God, I will sit in the mountain of the covenant, in the sides\r\nof the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be\r\nlike the most High. But yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, into the\r\ndepth of the pit” (Isaiah xiv. 12-15). The words of the prophet may in\r\none sense, perhaps primarily, be directed against Merodach-baladan, King\r\nof Babylon, but all the early Fathers and later commentators are agreed\r\nin understanding the passage as applying with deeper significance to the\r\nfall of the rebel angel. This interpretation is confirmed by the words\r\nof Our Lord to His disciples: “I saw Satan like lightning falling from\r\nheaven.” (Uidebam Satanam sicut fulgur de cœlo cadentem.) S. Luke x. 18.\r\n\r\nAn obvious question which next arises and which has been amply discussed\r\nby the theologians is: What was the nature of the sin of the rebel\r\nangels? This point presents some difficulty, for theology has logically\r\nformed the highest estimate of the perfection of the angelic nature,\r\nthe powers and possibilities of the angelic knowledge. Sins of the flesh\r\nare certainly impossible to angels, and from many sins which are purely\r\nspiritual and intellectual they would seem to be equally debarred. The\r\ngreat offence of Lucifer appears to have been the desire of independence\r\nof God and equality with God.\r\n\r\nIt is theologically certain that Lucifer held a very high rank in the\r\ncelestial hierarchy, and it is evident that he maintains some kind of\r\nsovereignty over those who followed him in his rebellion: “Si autem,”\r\nsays Our Lord, “et Satanas in seipsum diuisus est quomodo stabit regnum\r\neius?” (If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom\r\nstand?) And S. Paul speaks of “Principem potestatis æris huius, qui nunc\r\noperatur in filios diffidentiæ.” (The Prince of the power of this air,\r\nwho now worketh in the sons of disobedience) Ephesians ii. 2. It may\r\nseem strange that those rebellious spirits who rose against their Maker\r\nshould be subordinate to and obey one of their fellows who led them to\r\ndestruction, but this in itself is a proof that Lucifer is a superior\r\nintelligence, and the knowledge of the angels would show them that they\r\ncan effect more mischief and evil by co-operation and organization,\r\nalthough their unifying principle is the bond of hate, than by anarchy\r\nand division. There can be little doubt that among their ranks are many\r\nmean and petty spirits[5]—to speak comparatively—but even these can\r\ninfluence and betray foolish and arrogant men. We shall be on safe ground\r\nif we follow the opinion of Suarez, who would allow Lucifer to have\r\nbeen the highest of all angels negatively, i.e. that no one was higher,\r\nalthough many (and among these the three great Archangels, S. Michael, S.\r\nGabriel, S. Raphael) may have been his equals.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that the highest of the angels, by reason of their\r\ngreater intellectual illumination, must have entirely realized the utter\r\nimpossibility of attaining to equality with God. So S. Anselm, _De Casu\r\nDiaboli_ (IV), says: “Non enim ita obtusæ mentis [diabolus] erat, ut\r\nnihil aliud simile Deo cogitari posse nesciret?” (The devil was surely\r\nnot so dull of understanding as to be ignorant of the inconceivability\r\nof any other entity like to God?) And S. Thomas writes, in answer to\r\nthe question, whether the Devil desired to be “as God,” “if by this we\r\nmean equality with God, then the Devil would not desire it, since he\r\nknew this to be impossible.” But as the Venerable Duns Scotus, Doctor\r\nsubtilis, admirably points out, we must distinguish between efficacious\r\nvolition and the volition of complaisance, and by the latter act an angel\r\ncould desire that which is impossible. In the same way he shows that,\r\nthough a creature cannot directly will its own destruction, it may do\r\nthis _consequenter_, i.e. it can will something from which this would\r\ninevitably follow.\r\n\r\nAnd although man must realize that he cannot be God, yet there have been\r\nmen who have caused themselves to be saluted as God and even worshipped\r\nas God. Such was Herod Agrippa I, who on a festival day at Cæsarea, had\r\nhimself robed in a garment made wholly of silver, and came into the\r\ncrowded theatre early in the morning, so that his vesture shone out in\r\nthe rays of the sun with dazzling light, and the superstitious multitude,\r\ntaught by his flatterers, cried out that he was a god, and prayed to\r\nhim as divine, saying: “Be thou merciful unto us, for although we have\r\nhitherto reverenced thee only as a man yet henceforth we own thee to\r\nbe god.”[6] Caligula, also, arrogated to himself divinity. “Templum\r\netiam numini suo proprium, et sacerdotes et excogitatissimas hostias\r\ninstituit.”[7] (He also built a temple in honour of his own godhead,\r\nand consecrated priests to offer him most splendid sacrifices.) This\r\nemperor, moreover, set up his statue in the Temple at Jerusalem, and\r\nordered victims to be sacrificed to him. Domitian, with something more\r\nthan literary compliment, is addressed by Martial as “Dominus Deusque\r\nnoster”[8] (Our Lord and our God), and he lived up to his title.\r\nHeliogabalus identified himself in some mystic way with the deity of\r\nEdessa, and ordered no god save himself to be worshipped at Rome, nay,\r\nthroughout the wide world: “Taking measures that at Rome no god should be\r\nhonoured save Heliogabalus alone.... Nor did he wish to stamp out only\r\nthe various Roman cults, but his desire was that all the whole wide world\r\nthrough, only one god, Heliogabalus, should everywhere be worshipped.”[9]\r\nTo cite further examples, and they are numerous, from Roman history were\r\nsuperfluous.[10] Perhaps the most astounding case of all was that of the\r\nPersian king, Khosroes (Khusrau) II, who in the seventh century sacked\r\nJerusalem and carried off the True Cross to his capital. Intoxicated\r\nwith success he announced by solemn proclamation that he was Almighty\r\nGod. He built an extraordinary palace or tower, in which there were vast\r\nhalls whose ceilings were painted with luminous suns, moons, and stars\r\nto resemble the firmament. Here he sat upon a lofty throne of gold, a\r\ntiara upon his head, his cope so sewn with diamonds that the stuff could\r\nnot be seen, sceptre and orb in his hands, upon one side the Cross,\r\nupon the other a jewelled dove, and here he bade his subjects adore him\r\nas God the Father, offering incense and praying him “Through the Son.”\r\nThis insane blasphemy was ended when the Persians were vanquished by the\r\nEmperor Heraclius, and in the spring of 629 the Cross was restored to\r\nJerusalem.[11]\r\n\r\nMontanus, the Phrygian heretic of the second century, who had originally,\r\nas S. Jerome tells us, been a priest of Cybele, actually claimed to be\r\nthe Trinity. “I am the Father, the Word, and the Paraclete,”[12] he said,\r\nand again, “I am the Lord God omnipotent who have descended into a man\r\n... neither an angel, nor an ambassador, but I, the Lord, the Father, am\r\ncome.”[13] Elipandus of Toledo in the eighth century spoke of Christ as\r\n“a God among gods,” inferring that there were many others who had been\r\ndivine. One may compare the incarnate gods adored in China and Tibet\r\nto-day. A Bohemian woman named Wilhelmina, who died in Milan, 1281,\r\ndeclared herself to be an incarnation of the Third Person of the Blessed\r\nTrinity, and was actually worshipped by crowds of fanatics, who caused\r\ngreat scandal and disorder. The Khlysti in Russia have not only prophets\r\nbut “Christs” and “Redeemers,” and they pray to one another. About 1830\r\nthere appeared in one of the American states bordering upon Kentucky\r\nan impostor who declared himself to be Christ. He threatened the world\r\nwith immediate judgement, and a number of ill-balanced and hysterical\r\nsubjects were much affected by his denunciations. One day, when he was\r\naddressing a large gathering in his usual strain, a German standing\r\nup humbly asked him if he would repeat his warnings in German for the\r\nbenefit of those present who only knew that tongue. The speaker answered\r\nthat he had never been able to learn that language, a reply which\r\nseemed so ludicrous in one claiming divinity that many of the auditors\r\nwere convulsed with laughter and so profane a charlatan soon lost all\r\ncredit. Monsignor Flaget, Bishop of Bardstoun, wrote an account of this\r\nextraordinary imposture in a letter dated 4 May, 1833,[14] where he says\r\nthe scene took place some three years before. About 1880 at Patiala\r\nin the Punjaub, a fanatic of filthy appearance named Hakim Singh gave\r\nhimself out to be Christ, and in a short time had a following of more\r\nthan four thousand persons, but within a few months they melted away.[15]\r\nMany “false Christs” have organized Russian sects. In 1840 a man drained\r\nthe peasants of Simboisk and Saratov of their money by declaring himself\r\nto be the Saviour; about 1880 the founder of the _bojki_, an illiterate\r\nfanatic named Sava proclaimed that he was the Father, and his kinsman,\r\nSamouil, God the Son. Ivan Grigorieff, founder of the “Russian Mormons,”\r\ntaught that he was divine; and other frenzied creatures, Philipoff,\r\nLoupkin, Israil of Selengisk, have all claimed to be the Messiah and God.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent then, that although rationally it should be inconceivable\r\nthat any sentient creature could claim divinity, actually the contrary\r\nis the case. The sin of Satan would appear to have been an attempt to\r\nusurp the sovereignty of God. This is further borne out by the fact that\r\nduring the Temptation of our Lord the Devil, showing Him “omnia regna\r\nmundi, et gloriam eorum” (all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of\r\nthem), said, “Hæc omnia tibi dabo, si cadens adoraueris me.” (All these\r\nwill I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me.) And he is\r\nrebuked: “Uade Satana: Scriptum est enim: Dominum Deum tuum adorabis, et\r\nilli soli seruies.” (Begone, Satan: for it is written: The Lord thy God\r\nshalt thou adore, and Him only shalt thou serve.) It should be remarked\r\nthat Lucifer was telling a lie. The kingdoms of this world are not his to\r\noffer, but only its sins and follies, disappointment and death. But here\r\nthe Devil is demanding that divine honours should be paid him. And this\r\nclaim is perpetuated throughout the witch trials. The witches believed\r\nthat their master, Satan, Lucifer, the fiend, the principle of evil,\r\nwas God, and as such they worshipped him with latria, they adored him,\r\nthey offered him homage, they addressed prayer to him, they sacrificed.\r\nSo Lambert Danéau, _Dialogue of Witches_ (trans. 1575), asserts: “The\r\nDiuell com̅aundeth them that they shall acknowledge him for their god,\r\ncal vpo̅ him, pray to him, and trust in him.—Then doe they all repeate\r\nthe othe which they haue geuen vnto him; in acknowledging him to be their\r\nGod.” Cannaert records that the accusation against Elisabeth Vlamynex of\r\nAlost, 1595, was “You were not even ashamed to kneel before Belzebuth,\r\nwhom you worshipped.”[16] De Lancre, in his _Tableau de l’Inconstance\r\ndes mauvais Anges_ (1613), informs us that when the witches presented a\r\nyoung child they fell on their knees before the demon and said: “Grand\r\nSeigneur, lequel i’adore.” (Great Lord, whom I worship.) The novice\r\njoining the witches made profession in this phrase: “I abandon myself\r\nwholly to thy power and I put myself in thy hands, acknowledging no other\r\ngod; and this since thou art my god.”[17] The words of Silvain Nevillon,\r\ntried at Orleans in 1614, are even plainer: “We say to the Devil that we\r\nacknowledge him as our master, our god, our creator.”[18] In America[19]\r\nin 1692, Mary Osgood confessed that “the devil told her he was her God,\r\nand that she should serve and worship him.”\r\n\r\nThere are numberless instances of prayer offered to the Devil by his\r\nservants. Henri Boguet, in his _Discours des Sorciers_ (Lyons, 1608),\r\nrelates that Antide Colas, 1598, avowed that “Satan bade her pray to\r\nhim night and morning, before she set about any other business.”[20]\r\nElizabeth Sawyer, the notorious witch of Edmonton (1621), was taught\r\ncertain invocations by her familiar. In her confession to the Rev. Henry\r\nGoodcole, who visited her in Newgate, upon his asking “Did the Diuell\r\nat any time find you praying when he came unto you, and did not the\r\nDiuell forbid you to pray to Iesus Christ, but to him alone? and did he\r\nnot bid you to pray to him, the Diuell as he taught you?” She replied:\r\n“He asked of me to whom I prayed, and I answered him to Iesus Christ,\r\nand he charged me then to pray no more to Iesus Christ, but to him the\r\nDiuell, and he the Diuell taught me this prayer, _Sanctibecetur nomen\r\ntuum, Amen_.”[21] So as Stearne reports in _Confirmation and Discovery\r\nof Witchcraft_ (1648), of the Suffolk witches: “_Ellen_, the wife of\r\n_Nicholas Greenleife_ of _Barton_ in _Suffolke_, confessed, that when\r\nshe prayed she prayed to the Devill and not to God.”\r\n\r\nIn imitation of God, moreover, the Devil will have his miracles,\r\nalthough these are θαύματα, mere delusive wonders which neither profit\r\nnor convince. Such was the feat of Jannes and Mambres, the Egyptian\r\nsorcerers, who in emulation of Moses changed their rods to serpents. To\r\nthis source we can confidently refer many tricks of Oriental jugglers.\r\n“I am satisfied,” wrote an English officer of rank and family, “that the\r\nperformances of the native ‘wise-men’ are done by the aid of familiar\r\nspirits. The visible growth of a mango tree out of an empty vessel into\r\nwhich a little earth is placed, a growth which spectators witness, and\r\nthe secret of which has never been discovered, may not be unreasonably\r\nreferred to the same occult powers which enabled the Egyptian magicians\r\nof old to imitate the miraculous acts which Moses, by God’s command,\r\nopenly wrought in the face of Pharaoh and his people.”[22] In the\r\nbasket-trick, which is performed without preparation in any place or\r\nspot—a greensward, a paved yard, a messroom—a boy is placed under a\r\nlarge wicker basket of conical shape, which may be examined and handled\r\nby all, and this is then stabbed through and through by the fakir with\r\na long sword that pierces from side to side. Screams of pain follow\r\neach thrust, and the weapon is discerned to be covered with fresh\r\nblood. The cries grow fainter and at length cease altogether. Then the\r\njuggler uttering cries and incantations dances round the basket, which\r\nhe suddenly removes, and no sign of the child is to be seen, no rent in\r\nthe wicker-work, no stain on the steel. But in a few seconds the boy,\r\nunharmed and laughing, appears running forward from some distant spot. In\r\nthis connexion we may well recall the words of Suarez: “[The Devil] can\r\ndeceive and trick the senses so that a head may appear to be cut off and\r\nblood to flow, when in truth no such thing is taking place.”[23]\r\n\r\nThe wizards of Tartary and Tibet, _bokte_, upon certain special days will\r\nwith great ceremony appear in the temples, which are always thronged\r\non these occasions, and whilst their disciples howl and shriek out\r\ninvocations, they suddenly throw aside their robes and with a sharp\r\nknife seem to rip open their stomachs from top to bottom, whilst blood\r\npours from the gaping wound. The worshippers, lashed to frenzy, fall\r\nprostrate before them and grovel frantically upon the floor. The wizard\r\nappears to scatter his blood over them, and after some five minutes he\r\npasses his hands rapidly over the wound, which instantly disappears, not\r\nleaving even the trace of a scar. The operator is noticed to be overcome\r\nwith intense weariness, but otherwise all is well. Those who have seen\r\nthis hideous spectacle assure us that it cannot be explained by any\r\nhallucination or legerdemain, and the only solution which remains is to\r\nattribute it to the glamour cast over the deluded crowd by the power of\r\ndiscarnate evil intelligences.[24]\r\n\r\nThe portentous growth of Spiritism,[25] which within a generation passed\r\nbeyond the limits of a popular and mountebank movement and challenged\r\nthe serious attention and expert inquiry of the whole scientific and\r\nphilosophical world, furnishes us with examples of many extraordinary\r\nphenomena, both physical and psychical, and these, in spite of the most\r\nmeticulous and accurate investigation, are simply inexplicable by any\r\nnatural and normal means. Such phenomena have been classified by Sir\r\nWilliam Crookes, in his _Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism_.\r\nThey include the movement of heavy bodies without contact, or with\r\ncontact altogether insufficient to explain the movement; the alteration\r\nof weight of bodies; the rising of tables and chairs off the ground\r\nwithout contact with any human person; the levitation of human beings;\r\n“apports,” objects such as flowers, coins, pieces of stone conveyed into\r\na hermetically closed room without any visible agency to carry them;\r\nluminous appearances; more or less distinct phantom faces and forms.\r\nIn spite of continual and most deliberate trickery, repeated and most\r\nhumiliating exposure, and this not only in the case of cheap charlatans\r\nbut also of famous mediums such as William Eglinton, there occur and have\r\nalways occurred phenomena which are vouched for upon the evidence of\r\nnames whose authority cannot be gainsaid. Do such manifestations proceed\r\nfrom the spirits of the departed or from intelligences which have never\r\nbeen in human form? Even avowed believers in a beneficent Spiritism,\r\nanxious to establish communication with dead friends, are forced to\r\nadmit the frequent and irresponsible action of non-human intelligences.\r\nThis conclusion is based upon lengthy and detailed evidence which it is\r\nonly possible very briefly to summarize. It proves almost impossible\r\nsatisfactorily to establish spirit identity, to ascertain whether the\r\ncommunicator is actually the individual he or it purports to be; the\r\ninformation imparted is not such as would naturally be expected from\r\nthose who have passed beyond this life but trivial and idle to a degree;\r\nthe statements which the spirits make concerning their own condition are\r\nmost contradictory and confused; the moral tone which pervades these\r\nmessages, at first vague and unsatisfactory, generally becomes repulsive\r\nand even criminally obscene. All these particulars unmistakably point\r\nto demoniac intervention and deceit.[26] The Second Plenary Council of\r\nBaltimore (1866) whilst making due allowance for fraudulent practice\r\nand subtle sleights in Spiritism declares that some at least of the\r\nmanifestations are to be ascribed to Satanic intervention, for in no\r\nother manner can they be explained. (_Decreta_, 33-41.) A decree of the\r\nHoly Office, 30 March, 1898, condemns Spiritistic practices, even though\r\nintercourse with evil spirits be excluded and intercourse sought only\r\nwith good angels.\r\n\r\nNot only with miracles but also in prophecies does Lucifer seek to\r\nemulate that God Whose Throne he covets. This point is dealt with by\r\nBishop Pierre Binsfeld, who in his _De Maleficis_ (1589) writes: “Nunc\r\nuidendum est an dæmones præscientiam habeant futurorum et secretorum,\r\nita ut ex eorum reuelatione possit homo prognosticare[27] et occulta\r\ncognoscere?... Prima conclusio: Futura, si in seipsis considerentur,\r\nanullo præterquam a solo Deo cognosci possunt.” (Next we will inquire\r\nwhether devils can have any foreknowledge of future events or of hidden\r\nthings so that a man might from their revelations to him foretell the\r\nfuture and discover the unknown?... First conclusion: The future,\r\nprecisely considered, can be known to none save to God alone.) But it\r\nmust be borne in mind that the intelligence of angels, though fallen,\r\nis of the acutest order, as Simon Maiolo in his _Dies caniculares_\r\nexplains: “Astutia, sapientia, acumine longe superant homines, et longius\r\nprogrediuntur ratiocinando.” (In shrewdness, knowledge, perspicuity, they\r\nfar excel mankind, and they can look much further into the future by\r\nlogical deduction.) And it is in this way that a demon will often rightly\r\ndivine what is going to happen, although more often the response will\r\neither be a lie or wrapped up in meaningless and ambiguous phrase, such\r\nas were the pagan oracles. A notable example of false prophets may be\r\nfound in the Camisards (probably from _camise_, a black blouse worn as a\r\nuniform), a sect of evil fanatics who terrorized Dauphiné, Vivarais, and\r\nchiefly the Cévennes at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Their\r\norigin was largely due to the Albigensian spirit, which had never been\r\nwholly stamped out in that district, and which was fanned to flame by the\r\nanarchical preaching and disordered pamphlets of the French Calvinists,\r\nsuch as Jurieu’s _Accomplissement des prophéties_. Pope Clement XI styles\r\nthe Camisards “that execrable race of ancient Albigenses.” De Serre, a\r\nrank old Calvinist of Dieulefit in Dauphiné, became suddenly inspired and\r\na wave of foul hysteria spread far and wide. In 1702 the saintly abbé de\r\nChaila was treacherously murdered by these wretches, who seized arms and\r\nformed themselves into offensive bands under such ruffians as Séguier,\r\nLaporte, Castanet, Ravenal, and Cavalier. Louis XIV sent troops to subdue\r\nthem, but the Catholic leaders at first do not seem to have appreciated\r\nthe seriousness of the position, and a desultory guerilla warfare dragged\r\non for some years. Cavalier escaped to England,[28] whence he returned in\r\n1709, and attempted to kindle a revolt in Vivarais. On 8 March, 1715, by\r\na proclamation and medals, Louis XIV announced that these demoniacs were\r\nentirely extinct.\r\n\r\nA number of these prophets fled to England, where they created great\r\ndisturbances, and Voltaire, _Siècle de Louis XIV_, XXXVI, tells us that\r\none of the leading refugees, a notorious rebel, Elie Marion, became so\r\nobnoxious on account of his _avertissements prophétiques_ and false\r\nmiracles, that he was expelled the country as a common nuisance.[29]\r\n\r\nThe existence of evil discarnate intelligences having been orthodoxly\r\nestablished, a realm which owns one chief, and it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose, many hierarchies, a kingdom that is at continual warfare with\r\nall that is good, ever striving to do evil and bring man into bondage; it\r\nis obvious that if he be so determined man will be able in some way or\r\nanother to get into touch with this dark shadow world, and however rare\r\nsuch a connexion may be it is, at least, possible. It is this connexion\r\nwith its consequences, conditions, and attendant circumstances, that is\r\nknown as Witchcraft. The erudite Sprenger in the _Malleus Maleficarum_\r\nexpressly declares that in his opinion a denial of the possibility of\r\nWitchcraft is heresy. “After God Himself hath spoken of magicians and\r\nsorcerers, what infidel dare doubt that they exist?” writes Pierre\r\nde Lancre in his _L’Incredulité et Mescreance du Sortilège_ (Paris,\r\n1622)[30]. That eminent lawyer Blackstone, in his _Commentaries_ (1765),\r\nIV, 4, asserts: “To deny the possibility, nay, actual existence of\r\nWitchcraft and Sorcery, is at once flatly to contradict the revealed Word\r\nof God in various passages both of the Old and New Testament; and the\r\nthing itself is a truth to which every Nation in the World hath in its\r\nturn borne testimony, either by examples seemingly well attested, or by\r\nprohibitory laws, which at least suppose the possibility of commerce with\r\nevil spirits.” Even the ultra-cautious—I had almost said sceptical—Father\r\nThurston acknowledges: “In the face of Holy Scripture and the teaching\r\nof the Fathers and theologians the abstract possibility of a pact with\r\nthe Devil and of a diabolical interference in human affairs can hardly\r\nbe denied.” Imposture, trickery, self-deception, hypnotism, a morbid\r\nimagination have, no doubt, all played an important part in legends of\r\nthis kind. It is not enough quite sincerely to claim magical powers to\r\npossess them in reality. Plainly, a man who not only firmly believes in\r\na Power of evil but also that this Power can and does meddle with and\r\nmar human affections and human destinies, may invoke and devote himself\r\nto this Power, may give up his will thereunto, may ask this Power to\r\naccomplish his wishes and ends, and so succeed in persuading himself\r\nthat he has entered into a mysterious contract with evil whose slave and\r\nservant he is become.[31] Moreover, as we should expect, the records\r\nteem with instances of common charlatanry, of cunning villainies and\r\ncrime masquerading under the cloak of superstition, of clever fraud, of\r\nwhat was clearly play acting and mumming to impress the ignorant and\r\nvulgar, of diseased vanity, sick for notoriety, that craved the name and\r\nreputation of witch, of quackery and cozening that proved lucrative and\r\ncomfortable enough.\r\n\r\nBut when every allowance has been made, as we examine in detail the long\r\nand bloody history of Witchcraft, as we recognize the fearful fanaticism\r\nand atrocious extravagances of the witch mania, as we are enabled to\r\naccount for in the light of ampler knowledge, both psychological and\r\nphysical, details and accidents which would have inevitably led to the\r\nstake without respite or mercy, as we can elucidate case after case—one\r\nan hysterical subject, a cataleptic, an epileptic, a sufferer from some\r\nobscure nervous disorder even to-day not exactly diagnosed; another,\r\ndenounced by the malice of private enemies, perhaps on political grounds;\r\na third, some doting beldame the victim of idlest superstition or mere\r\nmalignity; a fourth, accused for the sake of gain by a disappointed\r\nblackmailer or thief; others, silly bodies, eccentrics, and half-crazed\r\ncranks; and the even greater number of victims who were incriminated by\r\npoor wretches raving in the agonies of the rack and boots;—none the less\r\nafter having thus frankly discounted every possible circumstance, after\r\nhaving completely realized the world-wide frenzy of persecution that\r\nswept through those centuries of terror, we cannot but recognize that\r\nthere remain innumerable and important cases which are not to be covered\r\nby any ordinary explanation, which fall within no normal category. As a\r\nmost unprejudiced writer has well said: “The underlying and provocative\r\nphenomena had really been present in a huge number of cases.”[32] And\r\nthere is no other way of accounting for these save by acknowledging\r\nthe reality of Witchcraft and diabolic contracts. It must be steadily\r\nremembered that the most brilliant minds, the keenest intelligences, the\r\nmost learned scholars, the noblest names, men who had heard the evidence\r\nat first hand, all firmly believed in Witchcraft. Amongst them are such\r\nsupreme authorities as S. Augustine, “a philosophical and theological\r\ngenius of the first order, dominating, like a pyramid, antiquity and the\r\nsucceeding ages”[33]; Blessed Albertus Magnus, the “Universal Doctor”\r\nof encyclopædic knowledge; S. Thomas Aquinas, Doctor Angelicus, one of\r\nthe profoundest intellects the world has ever seen; the Seraphic S.\r\nBonaventura, most loving of mystics; Popes not a few, Alexander IV, the\r\nfriend of the Franciscans, prudent, kindly, deeply religious, “assiduous\r\nin prayer and strict in abstinence”[34]; John XXII, “a man of serious\r\ncharacter, of austere and simple habits, broadly cultivated”[35];\r\nBenedict XII, a pious Cistercian monk, most learned in theology; Innocent\r\nVIII, a magnificent prelate, scholar and diplomatist; Gregory XV, an\r\nexpert in canon and civil law, most just and merciful of pontiffs,\r\nbrilliantly talented. We have the names of learned men, such as Gerson,\r\nChancellor of Notre-Dame and of the University of Paris, “justly regarded\r\nas one of the master intellects of his age”[36]; James Sprenger, O.P.,\r\nwho for all his etymological errors was a scholar of vast attainments;\r\nJean Bodin, “one of the chief founders of political philosophy and\r\npolitical history”[36]; Erasmus; Bishop Jewell, of Salisbury, “one\r\nof the ablest and most authoritative expounders of the true genius and\r\nteaching of the reformed Church of England”[37]; the gallant Raleigh;\r\nLord Bacon; Sir Edward Coke; Cardinal Mazarin; the illustrious Boyle;\r\nCudworth, “perhaps the most profound of all the great scholars who\r\nhave adorned the English Church”[36]; Selden; Henry More; Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne; Joseph Glanvill, who “has been surpassed in genius by few of his\r\nsuccessors”[36]; Meric Casaubon, the learned Prebendary of Canterbury;\r\nSir Matthew Hale; Sir George Mackenzie; William Blackstone; and many\r\nanother divine, lawyer, scholar, of lesser note. It is inconceivable\r\nthat all these, mistaken as they might be in some details, should have\r\nbeen wholly deluded and beguiled. The learned Sinistrari in his _De\r\nDæmonialitate_,[38] upon the authoritative sentence of Francesco-Maria\r\nGuazzo, an Ambrosian, (_Compendium Maleficarum_, Liber I. 7), writes:\r\n“Primo, ineunt pactum expressum cum Dæmone aut alio Mago seu Malefico\r\nuicem Dæmonis gerente, et testibus præsentibus de seruitio diabolico\r\nsuscipiendo: Dæmon uero uice uersa honores, diuitias, et carnales\r\ndelectationes illis pollicetur.” (Firstly, the Novices have to conclude\r\nwith the Demon, or some other Wizard or Magician acting in the Demon’s\r\nplace, an express compact by which, in the presence of witnesses, they\r\nenlist in the Demon’s service, he giving them in exchange his pledge for\r\nhonours, riches, and carnal pleasures.)\r\n\r\nIt is said that the formal pact was sometimes verbal, sometimes a\r\nsigned document. In every case it was voluntary, and as Görres points\r\nout, the usual initiation into these foul mysteries was through some\r\nsecret society at an assembly of which the neophyte bound himself with\r\nterrific oaths and a blasphemy to the service of evil. But there are\r\ncases which can only be explained by the materialization of a dark\r\nintelligence who actually received a bond from the worshipper. These\r\nare, of course, extremely rare; but occasionally the judges were able\r\nto examine such parchments and deeds. In 1453 Guillaume Edelin, Prior\r\nof S. Germain-en-Laye, signed a compact with the Devil, and this was\r\nafterwards found upon his person. Pierre de Lancre relates that the witch\r\nStevenote de Audebert, who was burned in January, 1619, showed him “le\r\npacte & conuention qu’elle auoit faict auec le Diable, escrite en sang de\r\nmenstrues, & si horrible qu’on auoit horreur de la regarder.”[39] In the\r\nlibrary at Upsala is preserved the contract by which Daniel Salthenius,\r\nin later life Professor of Hebrew at Königsberg, sold himself to Satan.\r\n\r\nIn the archives of the Sacred Office is preserved a picture of the\r\nCrucifixion of which the following account is given: A young man of\r\nnotoriously wicked life and extreme impiety having squandered his\r\nfortune, and being in desperate need, resolved to sell himself body\r\nand soul to Lucifer on condition that he should be supplied with money\r\nenough to enable him to indulge in all the luxuries and lusts he desired.\r\nIt is said the demon assumed a visible form, and required him to write\r\ndown an act of self-donation to hell. This the youth consented to do on\r\none proviso. He asked the demon if he had been present on Calvary, and\r\nwhen he was answered in the affirmative he insisted that Lucifer should\r\ntrace him an exact representation of the Crucifixion, upon which he\r\nwould hand over the completed document. The fiend after much hesitation\r\nconsented, and shortly produced a picture. But at the sight of the racked\r\nand bleeding Body stretched on the Cross the youth was seized with such\r\ncontrition that falling upon his knees he invoked the help of God. His\r\ncompanion disappeared, leaving the fatal contract and picture. The\r\npenitent, in order to gain absolution for so heinous guilt, was obliged\r\nto have recourse to the Cardinal Penitentiary, and the picture was taken\r\nin charge by the Holy Office. Prince Barberini afterwards obtained\r\npermission to have an exact copy made of it, and this eventually he\r\npresented to the Capuchins at S. Maria della Concezione.\r\n\r\nA contract with Satan was said always to be signed in the blood of\r\nthe executor. “The signature is almost invariably subscribed with the\r\nwriter’s own blood.... Thus at Augsburg Joseph Egmund Schultz declared\r\nthat on the 15 May, 1671, towards midnight, when it was betwixt eleven\r\nand twelve of the clock, he threw down, where three crossroads met, an\r\nilluminated parchment, written throughout in his own blood and wrapped up\r\nin a fair kerchief, and thus he sealed the compact ... Widmann also tells\r\nus how that unhappy wretch Faust slightly cut his thumb and with the\r\ndrops of blood which trickled thence devoted himself in writing body and\r\nsoul to the Devil, utterly repudiating God’s part in him.”[40] From the\r\nearliest times and in many nations we find human blood used inviolably\r\nto ratify the pledged word.[41] Rochholz, I, 52, relates that it is\r\na custom of German University freshmen (Burschen) for the parties to\r\nwrite “mutually with their own blood leaves in each other’s albums.” The\r\nparchment is still said to be in existence on which with his own blood\r\nMaximilian, the great and devout Bavarian elector, religiously dedicated\r\nhimself to the Most Holy Mother of God. Blood was the most sacred and\r\nirrevocable of seals, as may be seen in the custom of blood-brotherhood\r\nwhen friendship was sworn and alliances concluded. Either the blood\r\nitself was drunk or wine mixed with blood. Herodotus (IV, 70) tells us\r\nthat the Scythians were wont to conclude agreements by pouring wine into\r\nan earthen vessel, into which the contracting parties having cut their\r\narms with a knife let their blood flow and mingle. Whereupon both they\r\nand the most distinguished of their following drank of it. Pomponius\r\nMela, _De Situ Orbis_, II, 1, records the same custom as still existing\r\namong them in his day: “Not even their alliances are made without\r\nshedding of blood: the partners in the compact wound themselves, and\r\nwhen the blood gushes out they mingle the stream and taste of it when it\r\nis mixed. This they consider to be the most assured pledge of eternal\r\nloyalty and trust.”[42] Gyraldus, _Topographia Hibernorum_, XXII, p.\r\n743, says: “When the Ireni conclude treaties the one drinks the blood of\r\nthe other, which is shed voluntarily for this purpose.” In July, 1891,\r\na band of brigands which had existed for three years was discovered and\r\nbroken up in South Italy. It was reported that in the ritual of these\r\noutlaws, who were allied to the “Mala Vita” of Bari, “the neophytes\r\ndrank blood-brotherhood with the captain of the band by sucking out and\r\ndrinking the blood from a scratch wound, which he had himself made in the\r\nregion of his heart.”\r\n\r\nIn several grimoires and books of magic, such as _The Book of Black Magic\r\nand of Pacts_, _The Key of Solomon the King_, _Sanctum Regnum_, may be\r\nfound goetic rituals as well as invocations, and if these, fortunately\r\nfor the operators, are occasionally bootless, it can only be said that\r\nDivine Power holds in check the evil intelligences. But, as Suarez justly\r\nobserves, even if no response be obtained from the demon “either because\r\nGod does not allow it, or for some other reason we may not know,”[43] the\r\nguilt of the experimenter in this dark art and his sin are in no wise\r\nlightened.[44] Towards the end of the eighteenth century a certain Juan\r\nPerez, being reduced to the utmost misery, vowed himself body and soul\r\nto Satan if he were revenged upon those whom he suspected of injuring\r\nhim. He consulted more than one magician and witch, he essayed more than\r\none theurgic ceremonial, but all in vain. Hell was deaf to his appeal.\r\nWhereupon he openly proclaimed his disbelief in the supernatural, in\r\nthe reality of devils, and mocked at Holy Scripture as a fairy tale, a\r\nnursery fable. Naturally this conduct brought him before the Tribunal of\r\nthe Holy Office, to whom at his first interrogation he avowed the whole\r\nstory, declaring himself ready to submit to any penance they might seem\r\nfit to inflict.\r\n\r\nAny such pact which may be entered into with the demon is not in the\r\nslightest degree binding. Such is the authoritative opinion of S.\r\nAlphonsus, who lays down that a necromancer or person who has had\r\nintercourse with evil spirits now wishing to give up his sorceries is\r\nbound: “1. Absolutely to abjure and to renounce any formal contract or\r\nany sort of commerce whatsoever he may have entered into with demonic\r\nintelligences; 2. To burn all such books, writings, amulets, talismans,\r\nand other instruments as appertain to the black art (i.e. crystals,\r\nplanchettes, ouija-boards, pagan periapts, and the like); 3. To burn the\r\nwritten contract if it be in his possession, but if it be believed that\r\nit is held by the demon, there is no need to demand its restoration since\r\nit is wholly annulled by penitence; 4. To repair any harm he has done\r\nand make good any loss.”[45] It may be remarked that these rules have\r\nbeen found exceedingly useful and entirely practical in dealing with\r\nmediums and others who forsake spiritism, its abominations and fearful\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nThere are examples in history, even in hagiography, of sorcerers who\r\nhave been converted. One of the most famous of these is S. Theophilus\r\nthe Penitent;[46] and even yet more renowned is S. Cyprian of Antioch\r\nwho, with S. Justina, suffered martyrdom during the persecution of\r\nDiocletian at Nicomedia, 26 September, 304.[47] Blessed Gil of Santarem,\r\na Portuguese Dominican, in his youth excelled in philosophy and medicine.\r\nWhilst on his way from Coimbra to the University of Paris he fell into\r\ncompany with a courteous stranger who offered to teach him the black art\r\nat Toledo. As payment the stranger required that Gil should make over his\r\nsoul to the Devil and sign the contract with his blood. After complying\r\nwith the conditions he devoted seven years to magical studies, and then\r\nproceeding to Paris easily obtained the degree of doctor of medicine.\r\nGil, however, repented, burned his books of spells, and returned to\r\nPortugal, where he took the habit of S. Dominic. After a long life of\r\npenitence and prayer he died at Santarem, 14 May, 1205, and here his body\r\nis still venerated.[48] His cult was ratified by Benedict XIV, 9 March,\r\n1748. His feast is observed 14 May.\r\n\r\nThe contract made by the witch was usually for the term of her life,\r\nbut sometimes it was only for a number of years, at the end of which\r\nperiod the Devil was supposed to kill his votary. Reginald Scot remarks:\r\n“Sometimes their homage with their oth and bargaine is receiued for a\r\ncerteine terme of yeares; sometimes for ever.”[49] Magdalena de la Cruz,\r\na Franciscan nun, born at Aquilar in 1487, entered the convent of Santa\r\nIsabel at Cordova in 1504. She acquired an extraordinary reputation\r\nfor sanctity, and was elected abbess in 1533, 1536, and 1539. Scarcely\r\nfive years later she was a prisoner of the Inquisition, with charges of\r\nWitchcraft proven against her. She confessed that in 1499 a spirit who\r\ncalled himself by the grotesque name Balbar, with a companion Pithon,\r\nappeared to her at the tender age of twelve, and she made a contract\r\nwith him for the space of forty-one years. In 1543 she was seized with\r\na serious illness, during which she confessed her impostures and demonic\r\ncommerce. She was confined for the rest of her life as a penitent in a\r\nhouse of the utmost austerity. Joan Williford, a witch of Faversham,\r\nacknowledged “that the Devil promised to be her servant about twenty\r\nyeeres, and that the time is now almost expired.”[50] In 1646 Elizabeth\r\nWeed, a witch of Great Catworth in Huntingdonshire, confessed that “the\r\nDevill then offer’d her that hee would doe what mischiefe she should\r\nrequire him; and said she must covenant with him that he must have her\r\nsoule at the end of one and twenty years which she granted.”[51] In 1664,\r\na Somerset sorceress, Elizabeth Style, avowed that the Devil “promised\r\nher Mony, and that she should live gallantly, and have the pleasure of\r\nthe World for Twelve years, if she would with her Blood sign his Paper,\r\nwhich was to give her Soul to him.”[52]\r\n\r\nSatan promises to give his votaries all they desire; knowledge, wealth,\r\nhonours, pleasure, vengeance upon their enemies; and all that he can give\r\nis disappointment, poverty, misery, hate, the power to hurt and destroy.\r\nHe is ever holding before their eyes elusive hopes, and so besotted are\r\nthey that they trust him and confide in him until all is lost. Sometimes\r\nin the case of those who are young the pact is for a short while, but\r\nhe always renews it. So at Lille in 1661 Antoinette Bourignon’s pupils\r\nconfessed: “The Devil gives them a Mark, which Marks they renew as often\r\nas those Persons have any desire to quit him. The Devil reproves them\r\nthe more severely, and obligeth them to new Promises, making them also\r\nnew Marks for assurance or Pledge, that those Persons should continue\r\nfaithful to him.”[53]\r\n\r\nThe Devil’s Mark to which allusion is here made, or the Witches’ Mark,\r\nas it is sometimes called, was regarded as perhaps the most important\r\npoint in the identification of a witch, it was the very sign and seal\r\nof Satan upon the actual flesh of his servant, and any person who bore\r\nsuch a mark was considered to have been convicted and proven beyond all\r\nmanner of doubt of being in league with and devoted to the service of the\r\nfiend. This mark was said to be entirely insensible to pain, and when\r\npricked, however deeply, it did not bleed. So Mr. John Bell, minister\r\nat Gladsmuir, in his tract _The Trial of Witchcraft; or Witchcraft\r\nArraigned and Condemned_, published early in the eighteenth century,\r\nexplains: “The witch mark is sometimes like a blew spot, or a little\r\ntate, or reid spots, like flea biting; sometimes also the flesh is sunk\r\nin, and hollow, and this is put in secret places, as among the hair of\r\nthe head, or eye-brows, within the lips, under the arm-pits, and in the\r\nmost secret parts of the body.” Robert Hink, minister at Aberfoill, in\r\nhis _Secret Commonwealth_ (1691), writes: “A spot that I have seen, as a\r\nsmall mole, horny, and brown-coloured; throw which mark, when a large pin\r\nwas thrust (both in buttock, nose, and rooff of the mouth), till it bowed\r\nand became crooked, the witches both men and women, nather felt a pain\r\nnor did bleed, nor knew the precise time when this was doing to them,\r\n(their eyes only being covered).” This mark was sometimes the complete\r\nfigure of a toad or a bat; or, as Delrio says, the slot of a hare, the\r\nfoot of a frog, a spider, a deformed whelp, a mouse.[54] The same great\r\nauthority informs us on what part of the body it was usually impressed:\r\n“In men it may often be seen under the eyelids, under the lips, under the\r\narmpits, on the shoulders, on the fundament; in women, moreover, on the\r\nbreast or on the pudenda.”[55]\r\n\r\nIn his profound treatise _De Dæmonialitate_ that most erudite Franciscan\r\nLudovico Maria Sinistrari writes: “[Sagæ seu Malefici] sigillantur a\r\nDæmone aliquo charactere, maxime ii, de quorum constantia dubitat.\r\nCharacter uero non est semper eiusdem formæ, aut figuræ: aliquando enim\r\nest simile lepori, aliquando pedi bufonis, aliquando araneæ, uel catello,\r\nuel gliri; imprimitur autem in locis corporis magis occultis: uiris\r\nquidem aliquando sub palpebris, aliquando sub axillis, aut labiis, aut\r\nhumeris, aut sede ima, aut alibi: mulieribus autem plerumque in mammis,\r\nseu locis mulieribus. Porro sigillum, quo talia signa imprimuntur, est\r\nunguis Diaboli.” (The Demon imprints upon [the Witches or Wizards]\r\nsome mark, especially on those whose constancy he suspects. That mark,\r\nmoreover, is not always of the same shape or figure: sometimes it is the\r\nimage of a hare, sometimes a toad’s leg, sometimes a spider, a puppy, a\r\ndormouse. It is imprinted on the most hidden parts of the body: with men,\r\nunder the eye-lids, or the armpits, or the lips, on the shoulder, the\r\nfundament, or somewhere else: with women it is usually on the breasts or\r\nthe privy parts. Now, the stamp which imprints these marks is none other\r\nbut the Devil’s claw.)\r\n\r\nThis Mark was made by the Devil, or by the Devil’s vicegerent at the\r\nSabbats upon the admission of a new witch. “The Diuell giveth to euerie\r\nnouice a marke, either with his teeth or his clawes,” says Reginald\r\nScot, _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 1584. The young witches of Lille\r\nin 1661 confessed that “the Devil branded them with an iron awl upon\r\nsome part of the body.”[56] In Scotland, Geillis Duncane, maid-servant\r\nto the deputy bailiff of Tranent, one David Seaton, a wench who was\r\nconcerned in the celebrated trial of Doctor Fian, Agnes Sampson, Euphemia\r\nMcCalyan, Barbara Napier, and their associates, would not confess even\r\nunder torture, “whereuppon they suspecting that she had been marked by\r\nthe devill (as commonly witches are) made diligent search about her,\r\nand found the enemies mark to be in her fore crag, or fore part of her\r\nthroate; which being found, shee confessed that all her doings was done\r\nby the wicked allurements and entisements of the devil, and that she\r\ndid them by witchcraft.”[57] In 1630 Catharine Oswald of Niddrie was\r\nfound guilty of sorcery, “the advocate for the instruction of the assyze\r\nproducing the declaration of two witnesses, that being in the tolbuith,\r\nsaw Mr. John Aird, minister, put a pin in the pannell’s shoulder,\r\n(where she carries the devill’s mark) up to the heid, and no bluid\r\nfollowed theiron, nor she shrinking thereat; which was againe done in\r\nthe justice-depute his own presence.” In 1643 Janet Barker at Edinburgh\r\nconfessed to commerce with the demon, and stated that he had marked\r\nher between the shoulders. The mark was found “and a pin being thrust\r\ntherein, it remained for an hour unperceived by the pannell.”[58]\r\n\r\nOn 10 March, 1611, Louis Gaufridi, a priest of Accoules in the diocese of\r\nMarseilles, was visited in prison, where he lay under repeated charges of\r\nfoulest sorcery, by two physicians and two surgeons who were appointed to\r\nsearch for the Devil’s mark. Their joint report ran as follows: “We, the\r\nundersigned doctors and surgeons, in obedience to the directions given us\r\nby Messire Anthoine de Thoron, sieur de Thoron, Councillor to the King\r\nin his Court of Parliament, have visited Messire L. Gaufridy, upon whose\r\nbody we observed three little marks, not very different in colour from\r\nthe natural skin. The first is upon his right thigh, about the middle\r\ntowards the lower part. When we pierced this with a needle to the depth\r\nof two fingers breadth he felt no pain, nor did any blood or other humour\r\nexude from the incision.\r\n\r\n“The second is in the region of the loins, towards the right, about an\r\ninch from the spine and some four fingers breadth above the femoral\r\nmuscles. Herein we drove the needle for three fingers breath, leaving it\r\nfixed in this spot for some time, as we had already done in the first\r\ninstance, and yet all the while the said Gaufridy felt no pain, nor was\r\nthere any effluxion of blood or other humour of any kind.\r\n\r\n“The third mark is about the region of the heart. At first the needle\r\nwas introduced without any sensation being felt, as in the previous\r\ninstances. But when the place was probed with some force, he said he\r\nfelt pain, but yet no moisture distilled from this laceration. Early the\r\nnext morning we again visited him, but we found that the parts which had\r\nbeen probed were neither swollen nor red. In our judgement such callous\r\nmarks which emit no moisture when pierced, cannot be due to any ancient\r\naffection of the skin, and in accordance with this opinion we submit our\r\nreport on this tenth day of March, 1611.\r\n\r\n                                    _Fontaine_, _Grassy_, Doctors;\r\n                                    _Mérindol_, _Bontemps_, Surgeons.”[59]\r\n\r\nOn 26 April, 1634, during the famous Loudun trials, Urbain Grandier, the\r\naccused was examined in order to discover the witch-mark. He was stripped\r\nnaked, blindfolded, and in the presence of the officials, René Mannoury,\r\none of the leading physicians of the town, conducted the search. Two\r\nmarks were discovered, one upon the shoulder-blade and the other upon the\r\nthigh, both of which proved insensible even when pierced with a sharp\r\nsilver pin.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the discovery of the devil-mark was regarded as one of the\r\nmost convincing indications—if not, indeed, an infallible proof—that\r\nthe accused was guilty since he bore indelibly branded upon his flesh\r\nSatan’s own sign-manual, it is easy to see how the searching for,\r\nthe recognition and the probing of, such marks actually grew to be a\r\nprofession in which not a few ingenious persons came to be recognized\r\nas experts and practical authorities. In Scotland, especially, the\r\n“prickers,” as they were called, formed a regular gild. They received a\r\ngood fee for every witch they discovered, and, as might be expected, they\r\ndid not fail to reap a golden harvest. At the trial of Janet Peaston,\r\nin 1646, the magistrates of Dalkeith “caused John Kincaid of Tranent,\r\nthe common pricker, to exercise his craft upon her. He found two marks\r\nof the Devil’s making; for she could not feel the pin when it was put\r\ninto either of the said marks, nor did the marks bleed when the pin was\r\ntaken out again. When she was asked where she thought the pins were\r\nput into her, she pointed to a part of her body distant from the real\r\nplace. They were pins of three inches in length.”[60] Another notorious\r\npricker was John Bain, upon whose unsupported evidence a large number of\r\nunfortunate wretches were sentenced to death. About 1634 John Balfour of\r\nCorhouse was feared over all the countryside for his exploits; whilst\r\ntwenty years later one John Dick proved a rival to Kincaid himself. The\r\nregular trade of these “common prickers” came to be a serious nuisance,\r\nand confessedly opened the door to all sorts of roguery. The following\r\nextraordinary incident shows how dangerous and villainous in mountebank\r\nhands the examinations could become, which, if conducted at all, ought\r\nat least to be safeguarded by every precaution and only entrusted to\r\nskilled physicians, who should report the result to grave and learned\r\ndivines. “There came then to Inverness one Mr. Paterson, who had run\r\nover the kingdom for triall off witches, and was ordinarily called the\r\nPricker, because his way of triall was with a long brass pin. Stripping\r\nthem naked, he alledged that the spell spot was seen and discovered.\r\nAfter rubbing over the whole body with his palms he slips in the pin,\r\nand, it seemes, with shame and fear being dasht, they felt it not, but\r\nhe left it in the flesh, deep to the head, and desired them to find and\r\ntake it out. It is sure some witches were discovered but many honest men\r\nand women were blotted and break by this trick. In Elgin there were two\r\nkilled; in Forres two; and one Margret Duff, a rank witch, burned in\r\nInverness. This Paterson came up to the Church of Wardlaw, and within\r\nthe church pricked 14 women and one man brought thither by the Chisholm\r\nof Commer, and 4 brought by Andrew Fraser, chamerlan of Ferrintosh. He\r\nfirst polled all their heads and amassed the heap of haire together,\r\nhid in the stone dich, and so proceeded to pricking.[61] Severall of\r\nthese dyed in prison never brought to confession. This villan gaind a\r\ngreat deale off mony, haveing two servants; at last he was discovered\r\nto be a woman disguished in mans cloathes. Such cruelty and rigure was\r\nsustained by a vile varlet imposture.”[62] No doubt in very many, in\r\nthe majority of instances, these witch-marks were natural malformations\r\nof the skin, thickened tissue, birthmarks—I myself have known a subject\r\nwho was by prenatal accident stamped upon the upper part of the arm with\r\nthe complete figure of a rat—moles, callous warts, or spots of some\r\nkind. But this explanation will not cover all the cases, and even the\r\nsceptical Miss Murray who writes: “Local anæsthesia is vouched for in\r\nmuch of the evidence, which suggests that there is a substratum of truth\r\nin the statements,” is bound candidly to confess, “but I can at present\r\noffer no solution of this problem.”[63] Moreover, as before noticed, this\r\nmark was not infrequently branded upon the novice at admission, often\r\nby the Witch-Master, who presided over the rout, sometimes—it must be\r\nadmitted—by non-human agency.\r\n\r\nThe “little Teat or Pap,” so often found on the body of the wizard or\r\nwitch, and said to secrete milk which nourished the familiar, must be\r\ncarefully distinguished from the insensible devil-mark. This phenomenon,\r\nfor no explainable reason, seems to occur only in the records of\r\nEngland and New England, where, however, it is of exceedingly frequent\r\noccurrence. It is worth remarking that in the last act of Shadwell’s\r\nplay, _The Lancashire Witches_ (1681), the witches are searched by a\r\nwoman, who reports “they have all great Biggs and Teats in many Parts,\r\nexcept Mother _Madge_, and hers are but small ones.” Shadwell, who in\r\nhis voluminous notes has citations from nearly fifty authors, on this\r\npoint writes: “The having of Biggs and Teats all modern Witchmongers\r\nin _England_ affirm.”[64] In 1597 at the trial of a beldame, Elizabeth\r\nWright, of Stapenhill, near Burton-on-Trent: “The old woman they stript,\r\nand found behind her right sholder a thing much like the vdder of an ewe\r\nthat giueth sucke with two teates, like vnto two great wartes, the one\r\nbehinde vnder her armehole, the other a hand off towardes the top of her\r\nshoulder. Being demanded how long she had those teates, she answered\r\nshe was borne so.”[65] In the case of the Witch of Edmonton, Elizabeth\r\nSawyer, who was in spite of her resistance searched upon the express\r\norder of the Bench, it was found by Margaret Weaver, a widow of an honest\r\nreputation, and two other grave matrons, who performed this duty that\r\nthere was upon her body “a thing like a Teate the bignesse of the little\r\nfinger, and the length of half a finger, which was branched at the top\r\nlike a teate, and seemed as though one had suckt it.”[66] John Palmer\r\nof St. Albans (1649) confessed that “upon his compact with the Divel,\r\nhee received a flesh brand, or mark, upon his side, which gave suck\r\nto two familiars.”[67] The Kentish witch, Mary Read of Lenham (1652),\r\n“had a visible Teat, under her Tongue, and did show it to many.”[68] At\r\nSt. Albans about 1660 there was a wizard who “had like a Breast on his\r\nside.”[69] In the same year at Kidderminster, a widow, her two daughters,\r\nand a man were accused; “the man had five teats, the mother three, and\r\nthe eldest daughter, one.”[70] In 1692 Bridget Bishop, one of the Salem\r\nwitches, was brought to trial: “A Jury of Women found a preternatural\r\nTeat upon her Body: But upon a second search, within 3 or 4 hours, there\r\nwas no such thing to be seen.”[71] There is similar evidence adduced\r\nin the accounts of Rose Cullender and Amy Duny, two Suffolk witches,\r\nexecuted in 1664; Elizabeth Horner, a Devon witch (1696); Widow Coman,\r\nan Essex witch, who died in her bed (1699); and, indeed, innumerable\r\nother examples might be quoted affording a whole catena of pertinent\r\nillustrations. No doubt many of these are explicable by the cases of\r\npolymastia (_mammæ erraticæ_) and polythelia (supernumerary nipples)\r\nof which there are continual records in recent medical works. It must\r\nbe freely admitted that these anatomical divagations are commoner than\r\nis generally supposed; frequently they are so slight that they may\r\npass almost unnoticed; doubtless there is exaggeration in many of the\r\ninexactly observed seventeenth-century narratives. However, it has to be\r\nsaid, as before, that when every most generous allowance is made, the\r\nfacts which remain, and the details are very ample, cannot be covered by\r\nphysical peculiarities and malformations. There is far more truth in the\r\nrecords of the old theologians and witch finders than many nowadays are\r\ndisposed to allow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n[1] Under Innocent III, 1215.\r\n\r\n[2] Diabolus enim et alii dæmones a Deo quidem natura creati sunt boni,\r\nsed ipsi per se facti sunt mali.\r\n\r\n[3] Bossuet says that the writings of Suarez contain the whole of\r\nScholastic Philosophy.\r\n\r\n[4] Since it contradicts a definite (_certa_) theological conclusion or\r\ntruth clearly consequent upon two premises, of which one is an article of\r\nfaith (_de fide_), the other naturally certain.\r\n\r\n[5] Which explains much of the trifling and silliness in Spiritism; the\r\nidle answers given through the mediums of the influences at work.\r\n\r\n[6] Josephus, _Antiquities_, XIX. 8. 2.\r\n\r\n[7] Suetonius, _Caligula_, XXII.

Nous\r\nne pensons nullement qu’on puisse mettre toujours sur le compte de la\r\nsuperchérie des faits de ce genre: car d’après tout ce que nous avons vu\r\net entendu parmi les nations idolâtres, nous sommes persuadé que le démon\r\ny joue un grand rôle. (These horrible ceremonies frequently occur in the\r\nlarger lamaseries of Tartary and Tibet. I am very certain that we cannot\r\nalways ascribe happenings of this sort to mere juggling or trickery; for,\r\nafter all that I have seen and heard among heathen people, I am confident\r\nthat the powers of evil are very largely concerned therein.)\r\n\r\n[25] I use this term rather than the more popular “Spiritualism.”\r\nSpiritism obtains in Italy, France and Germany. “Spiritualism” is\r\ncorrectly a technical name for the doctrine which denies that the\r\ncontents of the universe are limited to matter and the properties and\r\noperations of matter.\r\n\r\n[26] For fuller, and, indeed, conclusive details see Godfrey Raupert’s\r\n_Modern Spiritism_, London, 1904; and Monsignor Benson’s _Spiritualism_,\r\n_Dublin Review_, October, 1909, and reprinted by the Catholic Truth\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n[27] _Prognosticare_ is a late word. Strictly to prognosticate is to\r\ndeduce from actual signs, to prophesy is to foretell the future without\r\nany such sign or token.\r\n\r\n[28] The Camisards were agreeably satirized by D’Urfey in his comedy _The\r\nModern Prophets; or, New Wit for a Husband_, produced at Drury Lane, 5\r\nMay, 1709, (_Tatler_, 11), and printed quarto, 1709, (no date). One of\r\nthe principal characters is “_Marrogn_, A Knavish French Camizar and\r\nPriest,” created by Bowen. This is a portrait of Elie Marion. In his\r\npreface D’Urfey speaks of “the abominable Impostures of those craz’d\r\nEnthusiasts” whom he lashes. The play had been composed in 1708, but\r\nproduction was postponed owing to the death of the Prince Consort,\r\n28 October of that year. Swift, _Predictions for the Year 1708_,\r\nhas: “_June_. This month will be distinguished at home, by the utter\r\ndispersing of those ridiculous deluded enthusiasts, commonly called\r\nthe _prophets_; occasioned chiefly by seeing the time come, when many\r\nof their prophecies should be fulfilled, and then finding themselves\r\ndeceived by contrary events.”\r\n\r\n[29] See also Fléchier’s _Récit fidèle_ in _Lettres choisies_, Lyons,\r\n1715; and Brueys’ _Histoire du fanatisme de notre temps_, Montpellier,\r\n1713.\r\n\r\n[30] Après que Dieu a parlé de sa propre bouche des magiciens et\r\nsorciers, qui est l’incredule qui on peut justement douter?\r\n\r\n[31] In the fourteenth century bas-reliefs on cathedrals frequently\r\nrepresent men kneeling down before the Devil, worshipping him, and\r\ndevoting themselves to him as his servants.

Ambrose ad\r\nNemus,[1] in his encyclopædic _Compendium Maleficarum_, first published\r\nat Milan, 1608, has drawn up under eleven heads those articles in which a\r\nsolemn and complete profession of Witchcraft was then held to consist:\r\n\r\n_First_: The candidates have to conclude with the Devil, or some other\r\nWizard or Magician acting in the Devil’s stead, an express compact by\r\nwhich, in the presence of witnesses they devote themselves to the service\r\nof evil, he giving them in exchange his pledge for riches, luxury, and\r\nsuch things as they desire.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_: They abjure the Catholic Faith, explicitly withdraw from\r\ntheir obedience to God, renounce Christ and in a particular manner the\r\nPatronage and Protection of Our Lady, curse all Saints, and forswear\r\nthe Sacraments. In Guernsey, in 1617, Isabel Becquet went to Rocquaine\r\nCastle, “the usual place where the Devil kept his Sabbath: no sooner had\r\nshe arrived there than the Devil came to her in the form of a dog, with\r\ntwo great horns sticking up: and with one of his paws (which seemed to\r\nher like hands) took her by the hand: and calling her by her name told\r\nher that she was welcome: then immediately the Devil made her kneel down:\r\nwhile he himself stood up on his hind legs; he then made her express\r\ndetestation of the Eternal in these words: _I renounce God the Father,\r\nGod the Son, and God the Holy Ghost_; and then caused her to worship and\r\ninvoke himself.”[2] De Lancre tells us that Jeannette d’Abadie, a lass\r\nof sixteen, confessed that she was made to “renounce & deny her Creator,\r\nthe Holy Virgin, the Saints, Baptism, father, mother, relations, Heaven,\r\nearth, & all that the world contains.”[3] In a very full confession made\r\nby Louis Gaufridi on the second of April, 1611, to two Capuchins, Father\r\nAnge and Father Antoine, he revealed the formula of his abjuration of\r\nthe Catholic faith. It ran thus: “I, Louis Gaufridi, renounce all good,\r\nboth spiritual as well as temporal, which may be bestowed upon me by\r\nGod, the Blessed Virgin Mary, all the Saints of Heaven, particularly my\r\nPatron S. John-Baptist, as also S. Peter, S. Paul, and S. Francis, and\r\nI give myself body and soul to Lucifer, before whom I stand, together\r\nwith every good that I may ever possess (save always the benefit of the\r\nsacraments touching those who receive them). And according to the tenour\r\nof these terms have I signed and sealed.”[4] Madeleine de la Palud, one\r\nof his victims, used a longer and more detailed declaration in which\r\nthe following hideous blasphemies occurred: “With all my heart and most\r\nunfeignedly and with all my will most deliberately do I wholly renounce\r\nGod, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; the most Holy Mother of God; all the\r\nAngels and especially my Guardian Angel, the Passion of Our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, His Precious Blood and the merits thereof, my lot in Paradise,\r\nall the good inspirations which God may give me in the future, all\r\nprayers which are made or may be made for me.”[5]\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_: They cast away with contempt the most Holy Rosary, delivered\r\nby Our Lady to S. Dominic;[6] the Cord of S. Francis; the cincture of S.\r\nAugustine; the Carmelite scapular bestowed upon S. Simon Stock; they cast\r\nupon the ground and trample under their feet in the mire the Cross, Holy\r\nMedals, _Agnus Dei_,[7] should they possess such or carry them upon their\r\npersons. S. Francis girded himself with a rough rope in memory of the\r\nbonds wherewith Christ was bound during His Passion, and a white girdle\r\nwith three knots has since formed part of the Franciscan habit. Sixtus\r\nIV, by his Bull _Exsupernæ dispositionis_, erected the Archconfraternity\r\nof the Cord of S. Francis in the basilica of the Sacro Convento at\r\nAssisi, enriching it with many Indulgences, favours which have been\r\nconfirmed by pontiff after pontiff. Archconfraternities are erected not\r\nonly in Franciscan but in many other churches and aggregated to the\r\ncentre at Assisi. The Archconfraternity of Our Lady of Consolation, or\r\nof the Black Leathern Belt of S. Monica, S. Augustine and S. Nicolas\r\nof Tolentino, took its rise from a vision of S. Monica, who received\r\na black leathern belt from Our Lady. S. Augustine, S. Ambrose, and\r\nS. Simplicianus all wore such a girdle, which forms a distinctive\r\nfeature of the dress of Augustinian Eremites. After the canonization\r\nof S. Nicolas of Tolentino it came into general use as an article of\r\ndevotion, and Eugenius IV in 1439 erected the above Archconfraternity.\r\nA Bull of Gregory XIII _Ad ea_ (15 July, 1575) confirmed this and added\r\nvarious privileges and Indulgences. The Archconfraternity is erected in\r\nAugustinian sanctuaries, from the General of which Order leave must be\r\nobtained for its extension to other churches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III\r\n\r\nCOMPENDIVM MALEFICARVM. Francesco-Maria Guazzo. Title-page of Second\r\nEdition\r\n\r\n[_face p. 82_]\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_: All witches vow obedience and subjection into the hands\r\nof the Devil; they pay him homage and vassalage (often by obscene\r\nceremonies), and lay their hands upon a large black book which is\r\npresented to them. They bind themselves by blasphemous oaths never\r\nto return to the true faith, to observe no divine precept, to do no\r\ngood work, but to obey the Demon only and to attend without fail the\r\nnightly conventicles. They pledge themselves to frequent the midnight\r\nassemblies.[8] These conventicles or covens[9] (from _conuentus_) were\r\nbands or companies of witches, composed of men and women, apparently\r\nunder the discipline of an officer, all of whom for convenience’ sake\r\nbelonged to the same district. Those who belonged to a coven were, it\r\nseems from the evidence at trials, bound to attend the weekly Esbat.\r\nThe arrest of one member of a coven generally led to the implication\r\nof the rest. Cotton Mather remarks, “The witches are organized like\r\nCongregational Churches.”\r\n\r\n_Fifthly_: The witches promise to strive with all their power and to\r\nuse every inducement and endeavour to draw other men and women to their\r\ndetestable practices and the worship of Satan.\r\n\r\nThe witches were imbued with the missionary spirit, which made them\r\ndoubly damnable in the eyes of the divines and doubly guilty in the eyes\r\nof the law. So in the case of Janet Breadheid of Auldearne, we find that\r\nher husband “enticed her into that craft.”[10] A girl named Bellot, of\r\nMadame Bourignon’s academy, confessed that her mother had taken her to\r\nthe Sabbat when she was quite a child. Another girl alleged that all\r\nworshippers of the Devil “are constrained to offer him their Children.”\r\nElizabeth Francis of Chelmsford, a witch tried in 1566, was only about\r\ntwelve years old when her grandmother first taught her the art of\r\nsorcery.[11] The famous Pendle beldame, Elizabeth Demdike “brought vp her\r\nowne Children, instructed her Graundchildren, and tooke great care and\r\npaines to bring them to be Witches.”[12] At Salem, George Burroughs, a\r\nminister, was accused by a large number of women as “the person who had\r\nSeduc’d and Compell’d them into the snares of Witchcraft.”\r\n\r\n_Sixthly_: The Devil administers to witches a kind of sacrilegious\r\nbaptism, and after abjuring their Godfathers and Godmothers of Christian\r\nBaptism and Confirmation they have assigned to them new sponsors—as it\r\nwere—whose charge it is to instruct them in sorcery: they drop their\r\nformer name and exchange it for another, generally a scurrilous and\r\ngrotesque nickname.\r\n\r\nIn 1609 Jeanette d’Abadie, a witch of the Basses-Pyrénées, confessed\r\n“that she often saw children baptized at the Sabbat, and these she\r\ninformed us were the offspring of sorcerers and not of other persons, but\r\nof witches who are accustomed to have their sons and daughters baptized\r\nat the Sabbat rather than at the Font.”[13] June 20, 1614, at Orleans,\r\nSilvain Nevillon amongst other crimes acknowledged that he had frequented\r\nassemblies of witches, and “that they baptize babies at the Sabbat with\r\nChrism.... Then they anoint the child’s head therewith muttering certain\r\nLatin phrases.”[14] Gentien le Clerc, who was tried at the same time,\r\n“said that his mother, as he had been told, presented him at the Sabbat\r\nwhen he was but three years old, to a monstrous goat, whom they called\r\nl’Aspic. He said that he was baptized at the Sabbat, at Carrior d’Olivet,\r\nwith fourteen or fifteen other children....”[15]\r\n\r\nAmong the confessions made by Louis Gaufridi at Aix in March, 1611, were:\r\n“I confess that baptism is administered at the Sabbat, and that every\r\nsorcerer, devoting himself to the Devil, binds himself by a particular\r\nvow that he will have all his children baptized at the Sabbat, if this\r\nmay by any possible means be effected. Every child who is thus baptized\r\nat the Sabbat receives a name, wholly differing from his own name. I\r\nconfess that at this baptism water, sulphur, and salt are employed: the\r\nsulphur renders the recipient the Devil’s slave whilst salt confirms his\r\nbaptism in the Devil’s service. I confess that the form and intention are\r\nto baptize in the name of Lucifer, Belzebuth and other demons making the\r\nsign of the cross beginning backwards and then tracing from the feet and\r\nending at the head.”[16]\r\n\r\nA number of Swedish witches (1669) were baptized: “they added, that he\r\ncaused them to be baptized too by such Priests as he had there, and made\r\nthem confirm their Baptism with dreadful Oaths and Imprecations.”[17]\r\n\r\nThe giving of a new name seems to have been very general. Thus in May,\r\n1569, at S. Andrews “a notabill sorceres callit Nicniven was condemnit to\r\nthe death and burnt.” Her Christian name is not given merely her witch’s\r\nname bestowed by the demon. In the famous Fian case it was stated that\r\nwhen at the meeting in North Berwick kirk Robert Grierson was named great\r\nconfusion ensued for the witches and warlocks “all ran hirdie-girdie,\r\nand were angry, for it was promised that he should be called Robert\r\nthe Comptroller, for the expriming of his name.”[18] Euphemia McCalyan\r\nof the same coven was called Cane, and Barbara Napier Naip. Isabel\r\nGoudie of Auldearne (1662) stated that many witches known to her had\r\nbeen baptized in their own blood by such names as “Able-and-Stout,”\r\n“Over-the-dike-with-it,” “Raise-the-wind,” “Pickle-nearest-the-wind,”\r\n“Batter-them-down-Maggy,” “Blow-Kate,” and similar japeries.\r\n\r\n_Seventhly_: The witches cut off a piece of their own garments, and as a\r\ntoken of homage tender it to the Devil, who takes it away and keeps it.\r\n\r\n_Eighthly_: The Devil draws on the ground a circle wherein stand the\r\nNovices, Wizards, and Witches, and there they confirm by oath all their\r\naforesaid promises. This has a mystical signification. “They take this\r\noath to the Demon standing in a circle described upon the ground,\r\nperchance because a circle is the Symbol of Divinity, & the earth God’s\r\nfootstool and thus he assuredly wishes them to believe that he is the\r\nlord of Heaven and earth.”[19]\r\n\r\n_Ninthly_: The sorcerers request the Devil to strike them out of the book\r\nof Christ, and to inscribe them in his own. Then is solemnly brought\r\nforward a large black book, the same as that on which they laid their\r\nhands when they did their first homage, and they are inscribed in this\r\nby the Devil’s claw.\r\n\r\nThese books or rolls were kept with great secrecy by the chief officer\r\nof the coven or even the Grand Master of a district. They would have\r\nbeen guarded as something as precious as life itself, seeing that they\r\ncontained the damning evidence of a full list of the witches of a\r\nprovince or county, and in addition thereto seems to have been added a\r\nnumber of magic formulæ, spells, charms, and probably, from time to time,\r\na record of the doings of the various witches. The signing of such a book\r\nis continually referred to in the New England trials. So when Deliverance\r\nHobbs had made a clean breast of her sorceries, “She now testifi’d, that\r\nthis _Bishop_ [Bridget Bishop, condemned and executed as a long-continued\r\nwitch] tempted her to sign the _Book_ again, and to deny what she had\r\nconfess’d.” The enemies of the notorious Matthew Hopkins made great\r\ncapital out of the story that by some sleight of sorcery he had got\r\nhold of one of these Devil’s memorandum-books, whence he copied a list\r\nof witches, and this it was that enabled him to be so infallible in his\r\nscent. The Witch-Finder General was hard put to it to defend himself from\r\nthe accusation, and becomes quite pitiful in his whining asseverations of\r\ninnocence. There is a somewhat vague story, no dates being given, that\r\na Devil’s book was carried off by Mr. Williamson of Cardrona (Peebles),\r\nwho filched it from the witches whilst they were dancing on Minchmoor.\r\nBut the whole coven at once gave chase, and he was glad to abandon it and\r\nescape alive.\r\n\r\nSometimes the catalogue of witches was inscribed on a separate parchment,\r\nand the book only used to write down charms and spells. Such a volume was\r\nthe Red Book of Appin known to have actually been in existence a hundred\r\nyears ago. Tradition said it was stolen from the Devil by a trick. It\r\nwas in manuscript, and contained a large number of magic runes and\r\nincantations for the cure of cattle diseases, the increase of flocks, the\r\nfertility of fields. This document, which must be of immense importance\r\nand interest, when last heard of was (I believe) in the possession of the\r\nnow-extinct Stewarts of Invernahyle. This strange volume, so the story\r\nran, conferred dark powers on the owner, who knew what inquiry would be\r\nmade ere the question was poised; and the tome was so confected with\r\noccult arts that he who read it must wear a circlet of iron around his\r\nbrow as he turned those mystic pages.\r\n\r\nAnother volume, of which mention is made—one that is often confused[20]\r\nwith, but should be distinguished from, these two—is what we may term\r\nthe Devil’s Missal. Probably this had its origin far back in the midst\r\nof the centuries among the earliest heretics who passed down their\r\nevil traditions to their followers, the Albigenses and the Waldenses\r\nor Vaudois. This is referred to by the erudite De Lancre, who in his\r\ndetailed account of the Black Mass as performed in the region of the\r\nBasses-Pyrénées (1609) writes: “Some kind of altar was erected upon the\r\npillars of infernal design, and hereon, without reciting the _Confiteor_\r\nor _Alleluya_, turning over the leaves of a certain book which he held,\r\nhe began to mumble certain phrases of Holy Mass.”[21] Silvain Nevillon\r\n(Orleans, 1614) confessed that “the Sabbat was held in a house.... He\r\nsaw there a tall dark man opposite to the one who was in a corner of\r\nthe ingle, and this man was perusing a book, whose leaves seemed black\r\n& crimson, & he kept muttering between his teeth although what he said\r\ncould not be heard, and presently he elevated a black host and then\r\na chalice of some cracked pewter, all foul and filthy.”[22] Gentien\r\nle Clerc, who was also accused, acknowledged that at these infernal\r\nassemblies “Mass was said, and the Devil was celebrant. He was vested\r\nin a chasuble upon which was a broken cross. He turned his back to the\r\naltar when he was about to elevate the Host and the Chalice, which were\r\nboth black. He read in a mumbling tone from a book, the cover of which\r\nwas soft and hairy like a wolf’s skin. Some leaves were white and red,\r\nothers black.”[23] Madeleine Bavent, who was the chief figure in the\r\ntrials at Louviers (1647), acknowledged: “Mass was read from the book\r\nof blasphemies, which contained the canon. This same volume was used in\r\nprocessions. It was full of the most hideous curses against the Holy\r\nTrinity, the Holy Sacrament of the Altar, the other Sacraments and\r\nceremonies of the Church. It was written in a language completely unknown\r\nto me.”[24] Possibly this blasphemous volume is the same as that which\r\nSatanists to-day use when performing their abominable rites.\r\n\r\n_Tenthly_: The witches promise the Devil sacrifices and offerings at\r\nstated times; once a fortnight, or at least once a month, the murder of\r\nsome child, or some mortal poisoning, and every week to plague mankind\r\nwith evils and mischiefs, hailstorms, tempest, fires, cattle-plagues and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nThe _Liber Pœnitentialis_ of S. Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury\r\n668-690, the earliest ecclesiastical law of England, has clauses\r\ncondemning those who invoke fiends, and so cause the weather to change\r\n“si quis emissor tempestatis fuerit.” In the _Capitaluria_ of Charlemagne\r\n(died at Aachen, 28 January, 814), the punishment of death is declared\r\nagainst those who by evoking the demon, trouble the atmosphere, excite\r\ntempests, destroy the fruits of the earth, dry up the milk of cows, and\r\ntorment their fellow-creatures with diseases or any other misfortune.\r\nAll persons found guilty of employing such arts were to be executed\r\nimmediately upon conviction. Innocent VIII in his celebrated Bull,\r\n_Summis desiderantes affectibus_, 5 December, 1484, charges sorcerers\r\nin detail with precisely the same foul practices. The most celebrated\r\noccasion when witches raised a storm was that which played so important\r\na part in the trial of Dr. Fian and his coven, 1590-1, when the witches,\r\nin order to drown King James and Queen Anne on their voyage from\r\nDenmark, “tooke a Cat and christened it,” and after they had bound a\r\ndismembered corpse to the animal “in the night following the said Cat\r\nwas convayed into the middest of the sea by all these witches, sayling\r\nin their riddles or cives, ... this doone, then did arise such a tempest\r\nin the sea, as a greater hath not bene seene.”[25] The bewitching of\r\ncattle is alleged from the earliest time, and at Dornoch in Sutherland\r\nas late as 1722, an old hag was burned for having cast spells upon the\r\npigs and sheep of her neighbours, the sentence being pronounced by the\r\nsheriff-depute, Captain David Ross of Little Dean. This was the last\r\nexecution of a witch in Scotland.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the sacrifice of children there is a catena of ample\r\nevidence. Reginald Scot[26] writes in 1584: “This must be an infallible\r\nrule, that euerie fortnight, or at the least euerie month, each witch\r\nmust kill one child at the least for hir part.” When it was dangerous or\r\nimpossible openly to murder an infant the life would be taken by poison,\r\nand in 1645 Mary Johnson, a witch of Wyvenhoe, Essex, was tried for\r\npoisoning two children, no doubt as an act of sorcery.[27] It is unknown\r\nhow many children Gilles de Rais devoted to death in his impious orgies.\r\nMore than two hundred corpses were found in the latrines of Tiffauges,\r\nMachecoul, Champtocé. It was in 1666 that Louis XIV was first informed of\r\nthe abominations which were vermiculating his capital “des sacrilèges,\r\ndes profanations, des messes impies, des sacrifices de jeunes enfants.”\r\nNight after night in the rue Beauregard at the house of the mysterious\r\nCatherine la Voisin the abbé Guibourg was wont to kill young children for\r\nhis hideous ritual, either by strangulation or more often by piercing\r\ntheir throats with a sharp dagger and letting the hot blood stream into\r\nthe chalice as he cried: “Astaroth, Asmodée, je vous conjure d’accepter\r\nle sacrifice que je vous présente!” (Astaroth! Asmodeus! Receive, I\r\nbeseech you, this sacrifice I offer unto you!) A priest named Tournet\r\nalso said Satanic Masses at which children were immolated; in fact the\r\npractice was so common that la Chaufrein, a mistress of Guibourg, would\r\nsupply a child for a crown[28] piece.\r\n\r\n_Eleventhly_: The Demon imprints upon the Witches some mark.... When\r\nthis has all been performed in accordance with the instructions of those\r\nMasters who have initiated the Novice, the latter bind themselves by\r\nfearful oaths never to worship the Blessed Sacrament; to heap curses on\r\nall Saints and especially to abjure our Lady Immaculate; to trample under\r\nfoot and spit upon all holy images, the Cross and Relics of Saints; never\r\nto use the Sacraments or Sacramentals unless with some magical end in\r\nview; never to make a good confession to the priest, but always to keep\r\nhidden their commerce with hell. In return the Demon promises that he\r\nwill at all times afford them prompt assistance; that he will accomplish\r\nall their desires in this world and make them eternally happy after their\r\ndeath. This solemn profession having been publicly made each novice has\r\nassigned to him a several demon who is called _Magistellus_ (a familiar).\r\nThis familiar can assume either a male or a female shape; sometimes he\r\nappears as a full-grown man, sometimes as a satyr; and if it is a woman\r\nwho has been received as a witch he generally assumes the form of a rank\r\nbuck-goat.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that there is no question here of animal familiars, but\r\nrather of evil intelligences who were, it is believed, able to assume\r\na body of flesh. The whole question is, perhaps, one of the most dark\r\nand difficult connected with Witchcraft and magic, and the details of\r\nthese hideous connexions are such—for as the Saints attain to the purity\r\nof angels, so, on the other hand, will the bond slaves of Satan defile\r\nthemselves with every kind of lewdness—that many writers have with an\r\nundue diffidence and modesty dismissed the subject far too summarily\r\nfor the satisfaction of the serious inquirer. In the first place, we\r\nmay freely allow that many of these lubricities are to be ascribed to\r\nhysteria and hallucinations, to nightmare and the imaginings of disease,\r\nbut when all deductions have been made—when we admit that in many cases\r\nthe incubus or succubus can but have been a human being, some agent of\r\nthe Grand Master of the district,—none the less enough remains from the\r\nrecords of the trials to convince an unprejudiced mind that there was\r\na considerable substratum of fact in the confessions of the accused.\r\nAs Canon Ribet has said in his encyclopædic _La Mystique Divine_, a\r\nwork warmly approved by the great intellect of Leo XIII: “After what\r\nwe have learned from records and personal confessions we can scarcely\r\nentertain any more doubts, and it is our plain duty to oppose, even if\r\nit be but by a simple affirmation on our part, those numerous writers\r\nwho, either through presumption or rashness, treat these horrors as idle\r\ntalk or mere hallucination.”[29] Bizouard also in his authoritative\r\n_Rapports de l’homme avec le démon_ writes of the incubus and succubus:\r\n“These relations, far from being untrue, bear the strongest marks of\r\nauthenticity which can be given them by official proceedings regulated\r\nand approved with all the caution and judgement brought to bear upon them\r\nby enlightened and conscientious magistrates who, throughout all ages,\r\nhave been in a position to test plain facts.”[30]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that if unshaken evidence means anything at all, if\r\nthe authority of the ablest and acutest intellects of all ages in all\r\ncountries is not to count for merest vapourings and fairy fantasies, the\r\npossibility—I do not, thank God, say the frequency—of these demoniacal\r\nconnexions is not to be denied. Of course the mind already resolved\r\nthat such things cannot be is inconvincible even by demonstration,\r\nand one can only fall back upon the sentence of S. Augustine: “Hanc\r\nassidue immunditiam et tentare et efficere, plures talesque asseuerant,\r\nut hoc negare impudentiæ uideatur.”[31] In which place the holy doctor\r\nexplicitly declares: “Seeing it is so general a report, and so many\r\naver it either from their own experience or from others, that are of\r\nindubitable honesty and credit, that the sylvans and fawns, commonly\r\ncalled incubi, have often injured women, desiring and acting carnally\r\nwith them: and that certain devils whom the Gauls call _Duses_, do\r\ncontinually practise this uncleanness, and tempt others to it, which is\r\naffirmed by such persons, and with such confidence that it were impudence\r\nto deny it.”\r\n\r\nThe learned William of Paris, confessor of Philip le Bel, lays down:\r\n“That there exist such beings as are commonly called incubi or succubi\r\nand that they indulge their burning lusts, and that children, as it\r\nis freely acknowledged, can be born from them, is attested by the\r\nunimpeachable and unshaken witness of many men and women who have been\r\nfilled with foul imaginings by them, and endured their lecherous assaults\r\nand lewdness.”[32]\r\n\r\nS. Thomas[33] and S. Bonaventura,[34] also, speak quite plainly on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Suarez, the famous Jesuit theologian, writes with caution\r\nbut with directness: “This is the teaching on this point of S. Thomas,\r\nwho is generally followed by all other theologians.... The reason for\r\ntheir opinion is this: Such an action considered in its entirety by\r\nno means exceeds the natural powers of the demon, whilst the exercise\r\nof such powers is wholly in accordance with the malice of the demon,\r\nand it may well be permitted by God, owing to the sins of some men.\r\nTherefore this teaching cannot be denied without many reservations and\r\nexceptions. Wherefore S. Augustine has truly said, that inasmuch as\r\nthis doctrine of incubi and succubi is established by the opinion of\r\nmany who are experienced and learned, it were sheer impudence to deny\r\nit.”[35] The Salmanticenses—that is to say, the authors of the courses\r\nof Scholastic philosophy and theology, and of Moral theology, published\r\nby the lecturers of the theological college of the Discalced Carmelites\r\nat Salamanca—in their weighty _Theologia Moralis_[36] state: “Some deny\r\nthis, believing it impossible that demons should perform the carnal\r\nact with human beings,” but they affirm, “None the less the opposite\r\nopinion is most certain and must be followed.”[37] Charles René Billuart,\r\nthe celebrated Dominican, in his _Tractatus de Angelis_ expressly\r\ndeclares: “The same evil spirit may serve as a succubus to a man, and\r\nas an incubus to a woman.”[38] One of the most learned—if not the most\r\nlearned—of the popes, Benedict XIV, in his erudite work _De Seruorum\r\nDei Beatificatione_, treats this whole question at considerable length\r\nwith amplest detail and solid references, Liber IV, Pars i. c. 3.[39]\r\nCommenting upon the passage “The sons of God went unto the daughters of\r\nmen” (Genesis vi. 4), the pontiff writes: “This passage has reference\r\nto those Demons who are known as incubi and succubi.... It is true that\r\nwhilst nearly all authors admit the fact, some writers deny that there\r\ncan be offspring.... On the other hand, several writers assert that\r\nconnexion of this kind is possible and that children may be born from\r\nit, nay, indeed, they tell us that this has taken place, although it\r\nwere done in some new and mysterious way which is ordinarily unknown to\r\nman.”[40]\r\n\r\nS. Alphonsus Liguori in his _Praxis confessariorum_, VII, n. 111, writes:\r\n“Some deny that there are evil spirits, incubi and succubi; but writers\r\nof authority for the most part assert that such is the case.”[41]\r\n\r\nIn his _Theologia Moralis_ he speaks quite precisely when defining the\r\ntechnical nature of the sin witches commit in commerce with incubi.[42]\r\n[43] This opinion is also that of Martino Bonacina,[44] and of Vincenzo\r\nFilliucci, S.J.[45] “Busembaum has excellently observed that carnal\r\nsins with an evil spirit fall under the head of the technical term\r\n_bestialitas_.”[46] This is also the conclusion of Thomas Tamburini,\r\nS.J. (1591-1675); Benjamin Elbel, O.F.M. (1690-1756);[47] Cardinal\r\nCajetan, O.P. (1469-1534) “the lamp of the Church”; Juan Azor, S.J.\r\n(1535-1603); “in wisdom, in depth of learning and in gravity of judgement\r\ntaking deservedly high rank among theologians” (Gury); and many other\r\nauthorities.[48] What a penitent should say in confession is considered\r\nby Monsignor Craisson, sometime Rector of the Grand Seminary of Valence\r\nand Vicar-General of the diocese, in his Tractate _De Rebus Uenereis ad\r\nusum Confessariorum_.[49] Jean-Baptiste Bouvier (1783-1854) the famous\r\nbishop of Le Mans, in his _Dissertatio in Sextum Decalogi Præceptum_[50]\r\n(p. 78) writes: “All theologians speak of ... evil spirits who appear in\r\nthe shape of a man, a woman, or even some animal. This is either a real\r\nand actual presence, or the effect of imagination. They decide that this\r\nsin ... incurs particular guilt which must be specifically confessed,\r\nto wit an evil superstition whereof the essence is a compact with the\r\nDevil. In this sin, therefore, we have two distinct kinds of malice, one\r\nan offence against chastity; the other against our holy faith.”[51] Dom\r\nDominic Schram,[52] O.S.B., in his _Institutiones Theologiæ Mysticæ_\r\nposes the following: “The inquiry is made whether a demon ... may thus\r\nattack a man or woman, whose obsession would be suffered if the subject\r\nwere wholly bent upon obtaining perfection and walking the highest paths\r\nof contemplation. Here we must distinguish the true and the false. It is\r\ncertain that—whatever doubters may say—there exist such demons, incubi\r\nand succubi: and S. Augustine asserts (_The City of God_, Book XV,\r\nchapter 23) that it is most rash to advance the contrary.... S. Thomas,\r\nand most other theologians maintain this too. Wherefore the men or women\r\nwho suffer these impudicities are sinners who either invite demons ...\r\nor who freely consent to demons when the evil spirits tempt them to\r\ncommit such abominations. That these and other abandoned wretches may be\r\nviolently assaulted by the demon we cannot doubt ... and I myself have\r\nknown several persons who although they were greatly troubled on account\r\nof their crimes, and utterly loathed this foul intercourse with the\r\ndemon, were nevertheless compelled sorely against their will to endure\r\nthese assaults of Satan.”[53]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that great Saints and scholars and all moral theologians\r\nof importance affirm the possibility of commerce with incarnate evil\r\nintelligences. The demonologists also range themselves in a solid phalanx\r\nof assent. Hermann Thyraus, S.J.,[54] in his _De Spirituum apparitione_\r\nsays: “It is so rash and inept to deny these (things) that so to adopt\r\nthis attitude you must needs reject and spurn the most weighty and\r\nconsidered judgements of most holy and authoritative writers, nay, you\r\nmust wage war upon man’s sense and consciousness, whilst at the same\r\ntime you expose your ignorance of the power of the Devil and the empery\r\nevil spirits may obtain over man.”[55] Delrio, in his _Disquisitiones\r\nMagicæ_, is even more emphatic: “So many sound authors and divines\r\nhave upheld this belief that to differ from them is mere obstinacy and\r\nfoolhardiness; for the Fathers, theologians, and all the wisest writers\r\non philosophy agree upon this matter, the truth of which is furthermore\r\nproved by the experience of all ages and peoples.”[56] The erudite\r\nSprenger in the _Malleus Maleficarum_ has much the same.[57] John Nider,\r\nO.P. (1380-1438) in his _Formicarius_, which may be described as a\r\ntreatise on the theological, philosophical, and social problems of his\r\nday, with no small acumen remarks: “The reason why evil spirits appear as\r\nincubi and succubi would seem to be that ... they inflict a double hurt\r\non man, both in his soul and body, and it is a supreme joy to devils thus\r\nto injure humankind.”[58] Paul Grilland in his _De Sortilegio_ (Lyons,\r\n1533) writes: “A demon assumes the form of the succubus.... This is the\r\nexplicit teaching of the theologians.”[59]\r\n\r\n“It has often been known by most certain and actual experience that\r\nwomen in spite of their resistance have been overpowered by demons.”\r\nSuch are the words of the famous Alfonso de Castro, O.F.M.,[60] whose\r\nauthoritative pronouncements upon Scripture carried such weight at the\r\nCouncil of Trent, and who was Archbishop-elect of Compostella when he\r\ndied. Pierre Binsfeld, _De confessione maleficarum_, sums up: “This is a\r\nmost solemn and undoubted fact not only proved by actual experience, but\r\nalso by the opinion of all the ages, whatever some few doctors and legal\r\nwriters may suppose.”[61]\r\n\r\nGaspar Schott, S.J. (1608-66), physicist, doctor, and divine, “one\r\nof the most learned men of his day, his simple life and deep piety\r\nmaking him an object of veneration to the Protestants as well as to the\r\nCatholics of Augsburg,” where his declining years were spent, lays down:\r\n“So many writers of such high authority maintain this opinion, that it\r\nwere impossible to reject it.”[62] Bodin, de Lancre, Boguet, Görres,\r\nBizouard,[63] Gougenot des Mousseaux,[64] insist upon the same sad facts.\r\nAnd above all sounds the solemn thunder of the Bull of Innocent VIII\r\nannouncing in no ambiguous phrase: “It has indeed come to our knowledge\r\nand deeply grieved are we to hear it, that many persons of both sexes,\r\nutterly forgetful of their souls’ salvation and straying far from the\r\nCatholic Faith, have (had commerce) with evil spirits, both incubi and\r\nsuccubi.”[65]\r\n\r\nI have quoted many and great names, men of science, men of learning,\r\nmen of authority, men to whom the world yet looks up with admiration,\r\nnay, with reverence and love, inasmuch as to-day it is difficult,\r\nwellnigh inconceivable in most cases, for the modern mind to credit the\r\npossibility of these dark deeds of devilry, these foul lusts of incubi\r\nand succubi.[66] They seem to be some sick and loathly fantasy of dim\r\nmediæval days shrieked out on the rack by a poor wretch crazed with agony\r\nand fear, and written down in long-forgotten tomes by fanatics credulous\r\nto childishness and more ignorant than savages. “Even if such horrors\r\never could have taken place in the dark ages,”—those vague Dark Ages!—men\r\nsay, “they would never be permitted now.” And he who knows, the priest\r\nsitting in the grated confessional, in whose ears are poured for shriving\r\nthe filth and folly of the world, sighs to himself, “Would God that in\r\ntruth it were so!” But the sceptics are happier in their singleness\r\nand their simplicity, happy that they do not, will not, realize the\r\nmonstrous things that lie only just beneath the surface of our cracking\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIt may not impertinently be inquired how demons or evil intelligences,\r\nsince they are pure spiritual beings, can not only assume human flesh\r\nbut perform the peculiarly carnal act of coition. Sinistrari, following\r\nthe opinion of Guazzo, says that either the evil intelligence is able to\r\nanimate the corpse of some human being, male or female, as the case may\r\nbe, or that, from the mixture of other materials he shapes for himself\r\na body endowed with motion, by means of which he is united to the human\r\nbeing: “ex mixtione aliarum materiarum effingit sibi corpus, quod mouet,\r\net mediante quo homini unitur.”[67] In the first instance, advantage\r\nmight be taken, no doubt, of a person in a mediumistic trance or hypnotic\r\nsleep. But the second explanation seems by far the more probable. Can\r\nwe not look to the phenomena observed in connexion with ectoplasm as\r\nan adequate explanation of this? It must fairly be admitted that this\r\nexplanation is certainly borne out by the phenomena of the materializing\r\nséance where physical forms which may be touched and handled are built\r\nup and disintegrated again in a few moments of time. Miss Scatcherd,\r\nin a symposium, _Survival_,[68] gives certain of her own experiences\r\nthat go far to prove the partial re-materialization of the dead by the\r\nutilization of the material substance and ectoplasmic emanations of the\r\nliving. And if disembodied spirits can upon occasion, however rare, thus\r\nmaterialize, why not evil intelligences whose efforts at corporeality are\r\nurged and aided by the longing thoughts and concentrated will power of\r\nthose who eagerly seek them?\r\n\r\nThis explanation is further rendered the more probable by the recorded\r\nfact that the incubus can assume the shape of some person whose embraces\r\nthe witch may desire.[69] Brignoli, in his _Alexicacon_, relates that\r\nwhen he was at Bergamo in 1650, a young man, twenty-two years of age,\r\nsought him out and made a long and ample confession. This youth avowed\r\nthat some months before, when he was in bed, the chamber door opened and\r\na maiden, Teresa, whom he loved, stealthily entered the room. To his\r\nsurprise she informed him that she had been driven from home and had\r\ntaken refuge with him. Although he more than suspected some delusion,\r\nafter a short while he consented to her solicitations and passed a night\r\nof unbounded indulgence in her arms. Before dawn, however, the visitant\r\nrevealed the true nature of the deceit, and the young man realized he had\r\nlain with a succubus. None the less such was his doting folly that the\r\nsame debauchery was repeated night after night, until struck with terror\r\nand remorse, he sought the priest to confess and be delivered from this\r\nabomination. “This monstrous connexion lasted several months; but at last\r\nGod delivered him by my humble means, and he was truly penitent for his\r\nsins.”[70]\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the Devil or the familiar assigned to the new witch\r\nat the Sabbat when she was admitted must obviously have been a man,\r\none of the assembly, who either approached her in some demoniacal\r\ndisguise or else embraced her without any attempt at concealment of his\r\nindividuality, some lusty varlet who would afterwards hold himself at\r\nher disposition. For we must always bear in mind that throughout these\r\nwitch-trials there is often much in the evidence which may be explained\r\nby the agency of human beings; not that this essentially meliorates their\r\noffences, for they were all bond-slaves of Satan, acting under his\r\ndirection and by the inspiration of hell. When the fiend has ministers\r\ndevoted to his service there is, perhaps, less need for his interposition\r\n_in propria persona_. Howbeit, again and again in these cases we meet\r\nwith that uncanny quota, by no means insignificant and unimportant,\r\nwhich seemingly admits of no solution save by the materialization of\r\nevil intelligences of power. And detailed as is the evidence we possess,\r\nit not unseldom becomes a matter of great difficulty, when we are\r\nconsidering a particular case, to decide whether it be an instance of a\r\nwitch having had actual commerce and communion with the fiend, or whether\r\nshe was cheated by the devils, who mocked her, and allowing her to deem\r\nherself in overt union with them, thus led the wretch on to misery and\r\ndeath, duped as she was by the father of lies, sold for a delusion and by\r\nprofitless endeavour in evil. There are, of course, also many cases which\r\nstand on the border-line, half hallucination, half reality. Sylvine de\r\nla Plaine, a witch of twenty-three, who was condemned by the Parliament\r\nof Paris, 17 May, 1616, was one of these.[71] Antoinette Brenichon, a\r\nmarried woman, aged thirty, made a confession in almost exactly the same\r\nwords. Sylvine, her husband Barthélemi Minguet, and Brenichon were hanged\r\nand their bodies burned.\r\n\r\nHenri Boguet, a Judge of the High Court of Burgundy, in his _Discours des\r\nSorciers_, devotes chapter xii to “The carnal connexion of the Demons\r\nwith Witches and Sorcerers.” He discusses: 1. The Devil knows all the\r\nWitches, & why. 2. He takes a female shape to pleasure the Sorcerers,\r\n& why. 3. Other reasons why the Devil (has to do) with warlocks and\r\nwitches.[72] Françoise Secretain, Clauda Ianprost, Iaquema Paget, Antoine\r\nTornier, Antoine Gandillon, Clauda Ianguillaume, Thieuenne Paget, Rolande\r\ndu Vernois, Ianne Platet, Clauda Paget, and a number of other witches\r\nconfessed “their dealings with the Devil.”[73] Pierre Gandillon and his\r\nson George also confessed to commerce with the Demon. Under his third\r\ndivision Boguet lays down explicit statements on the matter.[74][75]\r\n\r\nThis unnatural physical coldness of the Demon is commented upon again and\r\nagain by witches at their trials in every country of Europe throughout\r\nthe centuries. I have already suggested that in some cases there was a\r\nfull materialization due to ectoplasmic emanations. Now, ectoplasm is\r\ndescribed[76] as being to the touch a cold and viscous mass comparable\r\nto contact with a reptile, and this certainly seems to throw a flood of\r\nlight upon these details. It may be that here indeed we have a solution\r\nof the whole mystery. In 1645 the widow Bash, a Suffolk witch, of Barton,\r\nsaid that the Devil who appeared to her as a dark swarthy youth “was\r\ncolder than man.”[77] Isobel Goudie and Janet Breadheid, of the Auldearne\r\ncoven, 1662, both asserted that the Devil was “a meikle, blak, rock man,\r\nwerie cold; and I fand his nature als cold, a spring-well-water.”[78]\r\nIsabel, who had been rebaptized at a Sabbat held one midnight in\r\nAuldearne parish church, and to whom was assigned a familiar named the\r\nRed Riever, albeit he was always clad in black, gave further details\r\nof the Devil’s person: “He is abler for ws that way than any man can\r\nbe, onlie he ves heavie lyk a malt-sek; a hudg nature, uerie cold, as\r\nyce.”[79]\r\n\r\nIn many of the cases of debauchery at Sabbats so freely and fully\r\nconfessed by the witches their partners were undoubtedly the males who\r\nwere present; the Grand Master, Officer, or President of the Assembly,\r\nexercising the right to select first for his own pleasures such women as\r\nhe chose. This is clear from a passage in De Lancre: “The Devil at the\r\nSabbat performs marriages between the warlocks and witches, and joining\r\ntheir hands, he pronounces aloud\r\n\r\n    Esta es buena parati\r\n    Esta parati lo toma.”[80]\r\n\r\nAnd in many cases it is obvious that use must have been made of an\r\ninstrument, an artificial phallus employed.[81]\r\n\r\nThe artificial penis was a commonplace among the erotica of ancient\r\ncivilizations; there is abundant evidence of its use in Egypt, Assyria,\r\nIndia, Mexico, all over the world. It has been found in tombs; frequently\r\nwas it to be seen as an ex-voto; in a slightly modified form it is yet\r\nthe favourite mascot of Southern Italy.[82] Often enough they do not\r\ntrouble to disguise the form. Aristophanes mentions the object in his\r\n_Lysistrata_ (411 B.C.), and one of the most spirited dialogues (VI) of\r\nHerodas (_circa_ 300-250 B.C.) is that where Koritto and Metro prattle\r\nprettily of their βαύβων, whilst (in another mime, VII) the ladies visit\r\nKerdon the leather-worker who has fashioned this masterpiece. Truly\r\nHerodas is as modern to-day in London or in Paris as he ever was those\r\ncenturies ago in the isle of Cos. _Fascinum_, explains the _Glossarium\r\nEroticum Linguæ Latinæ_,[83] “Penis fictitius ex corio, aut pannis\r\nlineis uel sericis, quibus mulieres uirum mentiebantur. Antiquissima\r\nlibido, lesbiis et milesiis feminis præsertim usitatissima. _Fascinis_\r\nillis abutebantur meretrices in tardos ascensores.” As one might expect\r\nPetronius has something to say on the subject in a famous passage where\r\nthat savage old hag[84] Œnothea fairly frightened Encolpius with her\r\n_scorteum fascinum_, upon which an erudite Spanish scholar, Don Antonio\r\nGonzalez de Salas, glosses: “Rubrum penem coriaceum ut Suidas exsertim\r\ntradit uoce φαλλόι. Confecti & ex uaria materia uarios in usus olim\r\n_phalli_ ex ligno, _ficu_ potissimum qui _ficulnei_ sæpius adpellati,\r\nex _ebore_, ex _auro_, ex _serico_, & ex _lineo panno_, quibus Lesbiæ\r\ntribades abutebantur.”[85] And Tibullus, speaking of the image of\r\nPriapus, has:[86]\r\n\r\n    Placet Priape? qui sub arboris coma\r\n    Soles sacrum reuincte pampino caput\r\n    Ruber sedere cum rubente fascino.\r\n\r\nThe Church, of course, condemned with unhesitating voice all such\r\npractices, whether they were connected (in however slight a degree) with\r\nWitchcraft or not. Arnobius, who regards all such offences as detestable,\r\nin his _Aduersus Nationes_, V (_circa_ A.D. 296), relates a curiously\r\nobscene anecdote which seems to point to the use of the fascinum by the\r\nGalli, the priests of Berecynthian Cybele,[87] whose orgies were closely\r\nakin to those of Dionysus. And the same story is related by Clement\r\nof Alexandria Προτρεπτικὸς πρὸς Ἕλληνας (_circa_ A.D. 190); by Julius\r\nFirmicus Maternus, _De Errore profanarum Religionum_ (A.D. 337-350);\r\nby Nicetas (_ob._ _circa_ A.D. 414) in a commentary on S. Gregory of\r\nNanzianzus, oratio XXXIX; and by Theodoret (_ob._ _circa_ A.D. 457)\r\n_Sermo octaua de Martyribus_. Obviously some very primitive rite is in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nLactantius, in his _De Falsa Religione_ (_Diuinarum Institutionum_,\r\nI, _circa_ A.D. 304), speaks of a phallic superstition, akin to the\r\nfascinum, as favoured by the vestals, and implies it was notoriously\r\ncurrent in his day. That eminent father, S. Augustine, _De Ciuitate\r\nDei_, VII, 21, gives some account of the fascinum as used in the rites\r\nof Bacchus, and when he is detailing the marriage ceremonies (VI,\r\n9), he writes: “Sed quid hoc dicam, cum tibi sit et Priapus nimius\r\nmasculus, super cuius immanissimum et turpissimum fascinum sedere nona\r\nnupta iubeatur, more honestissimo et religiosissimo matronarum.” The\r\nhistorian, Evagrius Scholasticus (_ob._ post A.D. 504), in his _Historia\r\nEcclesiastica_ (XI, 2), says that the ritual of Priapus was quite open\r\nin his day, and the fascinum widely known. Nicephorus Calixtus, a later\r\nByzantine, who died about the middle of the fourteenth century but whose\r\nChronicle closed with the death of Leo Philosophus, A.D. 911, speaks of\r\nphallic ceremonies and of the use of ithy-phalli.[88]\r\n\r\nCouncil after council forbade the use of the fascinum, and their very\r\ninsistence of prohibition show how deeply these abominations had taken\r\nroot. The Second Council of Châlon-sur-Saône (813) is quite plain and\r\nunequivocal; so are the synods of de Mano (1247) and Tours (1396).\r\nBurchard of Worms (died 25 Aug., 1025) in his famous _Decretum_ has:\r\n“Fecisti quod quædam mulieres facere solent, ut facere quoddam molimen\r\naut mechinamentum in modum uirilis membri, ad mensuram tuæ uoluptatis,\r\net illud loco uerendorum tuorum, aut alterius, cum aliquibus ligaturis\r\ncolligares, et fornicationem faceres cum aliis mulierculis, uel aliæ\r\neodem instrumento, siue alio, tecum? Si fecisti, quinque annos per\r\nlegitimas ferias pœniteas.” And again: “Fecisti quod quædam mulieres\r\nfacere solent, ut iam supra dicto molimine uel alio aliquo machinamento,\r\ntu ipsa in te solam faceres fornicationem? Si fecisti, unum annum per\r\nlegitimas ferias pœniteas.”\r\n\r\nOther old Penitentials have: “Mulier qualicumque molimine aut per seipsum\r\naut cum altera fornicans, tres annos pœniteat; unum ex his in pane et\r\naqua.”\r\n\r\n“Cum sanctimoniali per machinam fornicans annos septem pœniteat; duos ex\r\nhis in pane et aqua.”\r\n\r\n“Mulia qualicumque molimine aut seipsam polluens, aut cum altera\r\nfornicans, quatuor annos. Sanctimonialis femina cum sanctimoniali per\r\nmachinamentum polluta, septem annos.”\r\n\r\nIt is demonstrable, then, that artificial methods of coition, common\r\nin pagan antiquity, have been unblushingly practised throughout all\r\nthe ages, as indeed they are at the present day, and that they have\r\nbeen repeatedly banned and reprobated by the voice of the Church. This\r\nvery fact would recommend them to the favour of the Satanists, and\r\nthere can be no doubt that amid the dark debaucheries which celebrated\r\nthe Sabbats such practice was wellnigh universal. Yet when we sift\r\nthe evidence, detailed and exact, of the trials, we find there foul\r\nand hideous mysteries of lust which neither human intercourse nor the\r\nemploy of a mechanical property can explain. Howbeit, the theologians\r\nand the inquisitors are fully aware what unspeakable horror lurks in the\r\nblackness beyond.\r\n\r\nThe animal familiar was quite distinct from the familiar in human shape.\r\nIn England particularly there is abundance of evidence concerning them,\r\nand even to-day who pictures a witch with nut-cracker jaws, steeple hat,\r\nred cloak, hobbling along on her crutch, without her big black cat beside\r\nher? It is worth remark that in other countries the domestic animal\r\nfamiliar is rare, and Bishop Francis Hutchinson even says: “I meet with\r\nlittle mention of _Imps_ in any Country but ours, where the Law makes\r\nthe feeding, suckling, or rewarding of them to be Felony.”[89] Curiously\r\nenough this familiar is most frequently met with in Essex, Suffolk, and\r\nthe Eastern counties. We find that animals of all kinds were regarded\r\nas familiars; dogs, cats, ferrets, weasels, toads, rats, mice, birds,\r\nhedgehogs, hares, even wasps, moths, bees, and flies. It is piteous\r\nto think that in many cases some miserable creature who, shunned and\r\ndetested by her fellows, has sought friendship in the love of a cat or\r\na dog, whom she has fondled and lovingly fed with the best tit-bits she\r\ncould give, on the strength of this affection alone was dragged to the\r\ngallows or the stake. But very frequently the witch did actually keep\r\nsome small animal which she nourished on a diet of milk and bread and\r\nher own blood in order that she might divine by its means. The details\r\nof this particular method of augury are by no means clear. Probably the\r\nwitch observed the gait of the animals, its action, the tones of its\r\nvoice easily interpreted to bear some fanciful meaning, and no doubt a\r\ndog, or such a bird as a raven, a daw, could be taught tricks to impress\r\nthe simplicity of inquirers.\r\n\r\nThe exceeding importance of blood in life has doubtless been evident\r\nto man from the earliest times. Man experienced a feeling of weakness\r\nafter the loss of blood, therefore blood was strength, life itself, and\r\nthroughout the ages blood has been considered to be of the greatest\r\ntherapeutic, and the profoundest magical, value. The few drops of\r\nblood the witch gave her familiar were not only a reward, a renewal of\r\nstrength, but also they established a closer connexion between herself\r\nand the dog, cat, or bird as the case might be. Blood formed a psychic\r\ncopula.\r\n\r\nAt the trial of Elizabeth Francis, Chelmsford, 1556, the accused\r\nconfessed that her familiar, given to her by her grandmother, a notorious\r\nwitch, was “in the lykenesse of a whyte spotted Catte,” and her\r\ngrandmother “taughte her to feede the sayde Catte with breade and mylke,\r\nand she did so, also she taughte her to cal it by the name of Sattan and\r\nto kepe it in a basket. Item that euery tyme that he did any thynge for\r\nher, she sayde that he required a drop of bloude, which she gaue him\r\nby prycking herselfe, sometime in one place and then in another.”[90]\r\nIt is superfluous to multiply instances; in the witch-trials of Essex,\r\nparticularly whilst Matthew Hopkins and his satellite John Stearne were\r\nhot at work from 1645 to 1647 the animal familiar is mentioned again\r\nand again in the records. As late as 1694 at Bury St. Edmunds, when\r\nold Mother Munnings of Hartis, in Suffolk, was haled before Lord Chief\r\nJustice Holt, it was asserted that she had an imp like a polecat. But\r\nthe judge pooh-poohed the evidence of a pack of clodpate rustics and\r\ndirected the jury to bring a verdict of Not Guilty.[91] “Upon particular\r\nEnquiry,” says Hutchinson, “of several in or near the Town, I find most\r\nare satisfied it was a very right Judgement.” In 1712 the familiar of\r\nJane Wenham, the witch of Walkerne, in Hertfordshire, was, at her trial,\r\nstated to be a cat.\r\n\r\nIn Ford and Dekker’s _The Witch of Edmonton_ the familiar appears upon\r\nthe stage as a dog. This, of course, is directly taken from Henry\r\nGoodcole’s pamphlet _The Wonderfull Discouerie of Elizabeth Sawyer_\r\n(London, 4to, 1621), where in answer to this question the witch confesses\r\nthat the Devil came to her in the shape of a dog, and of two colours,\r\nsometimes of black and sometimes of white. Some children had informed\r\nthe Court that they had seen her feeding imps, two white ferrets, with\r\nwhite bread and milk, but this she steadfastly denied. In Goethe’s\r\n_Faust_, Part I, Scene 2, Mephistopheles first appears to Faust outside\r\nthe city gates as a black poodle and accompanies him back to his study,\r\nsnarling and yelping when _In Principio_ is read. This is part of the\r\nold legend. Manlius (1590), in the report of his conversation with\r\nMelanchthon, quotes the latter as having said: “He [Faust] had a dog\r\nwith him, which was the devil.” Paolo Jovio relates[92] that the famous\r\nCornelius Agrippa always kept a demon attendant upon him in the shape\r\nof a black dog. But John Weye, in his well-known work _De Præstigiis\r\nDæmonum_,[93] informs us that he had lived for years in daily attendance\r\nupon Agrippa and that the black dog, _Monsieur_, respecting which such\r\nstrange stories were spread was a perfectly innocent animal which he\r\nhad often led about himself in its leash. Agrippa was much attached to\r\nhis dog, which used to eat off the table with him and of nights lie in\r\nhis bed. Since he was a profound scholar and a great recluse he never\r\ntroubled to contradict the idle gossip his neighbours clacked at window\r\nand door. It is hardly surprising when one considers the hermetic works\r\nwhich go under Agrippa’s name that even in his lifetime this great man\r\nshould have acquired the reputation of a mighty magician.\r\n\r\nGrotesque names were generally given to the familiar: Lizabet; Verd-Joli;\r\nMaître Persil (parsley); Verdelet; Martinet; Abrahel (a succubus); and\r\nto animal familiars in England, Tissy; Grissell; Greedigut; Blackman;\r\nJezebel (a succubus); Ilemanzar; Jarmara; Pyewackett.\r\n\r\nThe familiar in human shape often companied with the witch and was\r\nvisible to clairvoyants. Thus in 1324 one of the accusations brought\r\nagainst Lady Alice Kyteler was that a demon came to her “quandoque in\r\nspecie cuiusdam æthiopis cum duobus sociis.” The society met with at\r\nSabbats is not so easily shaken off as might be wished.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n[1] Two local Milanese Orders, the Apostolini of S. Barnabas and the\r\nCongregation of S. Ambrose _ad Nemus_, were united by a Brief of\r\nSixtus V, 15 August, 1589. 11 January, 1606, Paul V approved the new\r\nConstitutions.

Teresa’s confessor (_ob._ December, 1625), in a commentary\r\non Exodus discusses the curious question: _An Angeli de se generare\r\npossint?_\r\n\r\n[41] Quidam hos dæmones incubos uel succubos dari negarunt; sed\r\ncommuniter id affirmant auctores.\r\n\r\n[42] Ad bestialitatem autem reuocatur peccatum cum dæmone succubo, uel\r\nincubo; cui peccato superadditur malitia contra religionem; et præterea\r\netiam sodomiæ, adulterii, uel incestus, si affectu uiri, uel mulieris,\r\nsodomitico, adulterino uel incestuoso cum dæmone coeat. Lib. III, Tract\r\niv. c. 2. Dubium 3.\r\n\r\n[43] The word bestialitas has theologically a far wider signification\r\nthan the word _bestiality_. In 1222 a deacon, having been tried before\r\nArchbishop Langton, was burned at Oxford on a charge of bestiality. He\r\nhad embraced Judaism in order to marry a Jewess. Professor E. P. Evans\r\nremarks: “It seems rather odd that the Christian lawgivers should have\r\nadopted the Jewish code against sexual intercourse with beasts, and\r\nthen enlarged it so as to include the Jews themselves. The question was\r\ngravely discussed by jurists whether cohabitation of a Christian with\r\na Jewess, or _vice versa_, constitutes sodomy. Damhouder (_Prax. rer.\r\ncrim._ c. 96 n. 48) is of the opinion that it does, and Nicolaus Boer\r\n(_Decis._, 136, n. 5) cites the case of a certain Johannes Alardus, or\r\nJean Alard, who kept a Jewess in his house in Paris and had several\r\nchildren by her: he was convicted of sodomy on account of this relation\r\nand burned, together with his paramour, ‘since coition with a Jewess\r\nis precisely the same as if a man should copulate with a dog’ (_Dopl.\r\nTheat._ ii, p. 157).

On certain ancient anniversaries the\r\nmeeting was always particularly solemn, with as large an attendance as\r\npossible, when all who belonged to the infernal cult would be required\r\nto present themselves and punishment was meted out to those who proved\r\nslack and slow; at other times these gatherings would be occasional,\r\nresorted to by the company who resided within a certain restricted area,\r\nit might be by only one coven of thirteen, it might be by a few more, as\r\nopportunity served. There were also, as is to be expected, variations\r\nproper to each country, and a seemingly endless number of local\r\npeculiarities. There does not clearly appear to be any formal and fair\r\norder in the ceremonies throughout, nor should we look for this, seeing\r\nthat the liturgy of darkness is of its essence opposed to the comely\r\nworship of God, wherein, as the Apostle bids, all things are to be done\r\n“decently and in order.”[1] The ceremonial of hell, sufficiently complex,\r\nobscure, and obscene, is even more confused in the witches’ narratives\r\nby a host of adventitious circumstances, often contradictory, nay, even\r\nmutually exclusive, and so although we can piece together a very complete\r\npicture of their orgies, there are some details which must yet remain\r\nunexplained, incomprehensible, and perhaps wholly irrational and absurd.\r\n“Le burlesque s’y mêle à l’horrible, et les puérilités aux abominations.”\r\n(Ribet, _La Mystique Divine_, III. 2. Les Parodies Diaboliques.) (Mere\r\nclowning and japery are mixed up with circumstances of extremest horror;\r\nchildishness and folly with loathly abominations.) In the lesser\r\nAssemblies much, no doubt, depended upon the fickle whim and unwholesome\r\ncaprice of the officer or president at the moment. The conduct of the\r\nmore important Assemblies was to a certain extent regularized and more\r\nor less loosely ran upon traditional lines. The name Sabbat may be held\r\nto cover every kind of gathering,[2] although it must continually be\r\nborne in mind that a Sabbat ranges from comparative simplicity, the\r\nsecret rendezvous of some half a dozen wretches devoted to the fiend,\r\nto a large and crowded congregation presided over by incarnate evil\r\nintelligences, a mob outvying the very demons in malice, blasphemy, and\r\nrevolt, the true face of pandemonium on earth.\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the word Sabbat does not seem to be exactly\r\nestablished. It is perhaps superfluous to point out that it has nothing\r\nto do with the number seven, and is wholly unconnected with the Jewish\r\nfestival. Sainte-Croix and Alfred Maury[3] are agreed to derive it from\r\nthe debased Bacchanalia. Sabazius (Σαβάζιος) was a Phrygian deity,\r\nsometimes identified with Zeus, sometimes with Dionysus, but who was\r\ngenerally regarded as the patron of licentiousness and worshipped with\r\nfrantic debaucheries. He is a patron of the ribald old Syrian eunuch\r\nin Apuleius: “omnipotens et omniparens Dea Syria et sanctus Sabadius\r\net Bellona et Mater Idaea (ac) cum suo Adone Venus domina”[4] are the\r\ndeities whom Philebus invokes to avenge him of the mocking crier.\r\nΣαβαζεῖν is found in the Scholiast on Aristophane (_Birds_, 874), and\r\nσαβαῖ, a Bacchic yell, occurs in a fragment of the _Baptæ_ of Eupolis;\r\nthe fuller phrase εὐοῖ Σαβοῖ being reported by Strabo the geographer. The\r\nmodern Greeks still call a madman ζαβός. But Littré entirely rejects any\r\nsuch facile etymology. “Attempts have been made to trace the etymology of\r\nthe Sabbat, the witches’ assembly, from _Sabazies_; but the formation of\r\nthe word does not allow it; besides, in the Middle Ages, what did they\r\nknow about _Sabazies_?”[5]\r\n\r\nEven the seasons of the principal Assemblies of the year differ in\r\nvarious countries. Throughout the greater part of Western Europe one of\r\nthe chief of these was the Eve of May Day, 30 April;[6] in Germany[7]\r\nfamous as Die Walpurgis-Nacht. S. Walburga (Walpurgis; Waltpurde; at\r\nPerche Gauburge; in other parts of France Vaubourg or Falbourg) was born\r\nin Devonshire _circa_ 710. She was the daughter of S. Richard, one of the\r\nunder-kings of the West Saxons, who married a sister of S. Boniface. In\r\n748 Walburga, who was then a nun of Wimbourne, went over to Germany to\r\nfound claustral life in that country. After a life of surpassing holiness\r\nshe died at Heidenheim, 25 February, 777. Her cultus began immediately,\r\nand about 870 her relics were translated to Eichstadt, where the\r\nBenedictine convent which has charge of the sacred shrine still happily\r\nflourishes. S. Walburga was formerly one of the most popular Saints in\r\nEngland, as well as in Germany and the Low Countries. She is patroness of\r\nEichstadt, Oudenarde, Furnes, Groningen, Weilburg, Zutphen, and Antwerp,\r\nwhere until the Roman office was adopted they celebrated her feast four\r\ntimes a year. In the Roman martyrology she is commemorated on 1 May, but\r\nin the Monastic Kalendar on 25 February. The first of May was the ancient\r\nfestival of the Druids, when they offered sacrifices upon their sacred\r\nmountains and kindled their May-fires. These magic observances were\r\nappropriately continued by the witches of a later date. There was not a\r\nhill-top in Finland, so the peasant believed, which at midnight on the\r\nlast day of April was not thronged by demons and sorcerers.\r\n\r\nThe second witches’ festival was the Eve of S. John Baptist, 23 June.\r\nThen were the S. John’s fires lit, a custom in certain regions still\r\nprevailing.[8] In olden times the Feast was distinguished like Christmas\r\nwith three Masses; the first at midnight recalled his mission as\r\nPrecursor, the second at dawn commemorated the baptism he confessed, the\r\nthird honoured his sanctity.\r\n\r\nOther Grand Sabbat days, particularly in Belgium and Germany, were S.\r\nThomas’ Day (21 December) and a date, which seems to have been movable,\r\nshortly after Christmas. In Britain we also find Candlemas (2 February),\r\nAllhallowe’en (31 October), and Lammas (1 August), mentioned in the\r\ntrials. Wright, _Narratives of Sorcery and Magic_ (I. p. 141), further\r\nspecifies S. Bartholomew’s Eve, but although a Sabbat may have been held\r\non this day, it would seem to be an exceptional or purely local use.\r\n\r\nDuring a famous trial held in the winter of 1610 at Logrono, a town of\r\nOld Castille, by the Apostolic Inquisitor, Alonso Becerra Holguin, an\r\nAlcantarine friar, with his two assessors Juen Valle Alvarado and Alonso\r\nde Salasar y Frias, a number of Navarrese witches confessed that the\r\nchief Sabbats were usually held at Zugarramurdi and Berroscoberro in the\r\nBasque districts, and that the days were fixed, being the vigils of the\r\n“nine principal feasts of the year,” namely, Easter, Epiphany, Ascension\r\nDay, the Purification and Nativity of Our Lady, the Assumption, Corpus\r\nChristi, All Saints, and the major festival of S. John Baptist (24 June).\r\nIt is certainly curious to find no mention of Christmas and Pentecost\r\nin this list, but throughout the whole of the process not one of the\r\naccused—and we have their evidence in fullest detail—named either of\r\nthese two solemnities as being chosen for the infernal rendezvous.[9]\r\n\r\nSatan is, as Boguet aptly says, “Singe de Dieu en tout,”[10] and it\r\nbecame common to hold a General Sabbat about the time of the high\r\nChristian festivals in evil mockery of these holy solemnities, and he\r\nprecisely asserts that the Sabbat “se tient encor aux festes les plus\r\nsolemnelles de l’année.”[11] (Is still held on the greatest festivals\r\nof the year.) So he records the confession of Antide Colas (1598), who\r\n“auoit esté au Sabbat à vn chacun bon iour de l’an, comme à Noel, à\r\nPasques, à la feste de Dieu.” The Lancashire witches met on Good Friday;\r\nand in the second instance (1633) on All Saints’ Day; the witches of\r\nKinross (1662) held an assembly on the feast of Scotland’s Patron, S.\r\nAndrew, 30 November, termed “S. Andrew’s Day at Yule,” to distinguish it\r\nfrom the secondary Feast of the Translation of S. Andrew, 9 May. The New\r\nEngland witches were wont to celebrate their chief Sabbat at Christmas.\r\nIn many parts of Europe where the Feast of S. George is solemnized with\r\nhigh honour and holiday the vigil (22 April) is the Great Sabbat of\r\nthe year. The Huzulo of the Carpathians believe that then every evil\r\nthing has power and witches are most dangerous. Not a Bulgarian or\r\nRoumanian farmer but closes up each door and fastens close each window at\r\nnightfall, putting sharp thorn-bushes and brambles on the lintels, new\r\nturf on the sills, so that no demon nor hag may find entry there.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Sabbats were naturally held in a great variety of places,\r\nwhilst the lesser Sabbats could be easily assembled in an even larger\r\nnumber of spots, which might be convenient to the coven of that district,\r\na field near a village, a wood, a tor, a valley, an open waste beneath\r\nsome blasted oak, a cemetery, a ruined building, some solitary chapel or\r\nsemi-deserted church, sometimes a house belonging to one of the initiates.\r\n\r\nIt was advisable that the selected locality should be remote and deserted\r\nto obviate any chance of espionage or casual interruption, and in many\r\nprovinces some wild ill-omened gully or lone hill-top was shudderingly\r\nmarked as the notorious haunt of witches and their fiends. De Lancre says\r\nthat the Grand Sabbat must be held near a stream, lake, or water of some\r\nkind,[12] and Bodin adds: “The places where Sorcerers meet are remarkable\r\nand generally distinguished by some trees, or even a cross.”[13] These\r\nancient cromlechs and granite dolmens, the stones of the Marais de Dol,\r\nthe monolith that lies between Seny and Ellemelle (Candroz), even the\r\nmarket-crosses of sleepy old towns and English villages, were among the\r\nfavourite rendezvous of the pythons and warlocks of a whole countryside.\r\nOn one occasion, which seems exceptional, a Sabbat was held in the\r\nvery heart of the city of Bordeaux. Throughout Germany the Blocksburg\r\nor the Brocken, the highest peak of the Hartz Mountains, was the great\r\nmeeting-place of the witches, some of whom, it was said, came from\r\ndistant Lapland and Norway to forgather there. But local Blocksburgs\r\nexisted, or rather hills so called, especially in Pomerania, which\r\nboasted two or three such crags. The sorcerers of Corrières held their\r\nSabbat at a deserted spot, turning off the highway near Combes; the\r\nwitches of la Mouille in a tumbledown house, which had once belonged to\r\nreligious; the Gandillons and their coven, who were brought to justice\r\nin June, 1598, met at Fontenelles, a forsaken and haunted spot near\r\nthe village of Nezar. Dr. Fian and his associates (1591) “upon the\r\nnight of Allhollen-Even” assembled at “the kirke of North-Berrick in\r\nLowthian.” Silvain Nevillon, who was executed at Orleans, 4 February,\r\n1615, confessed “que le Sabbat se tenoit dans vne maison,” and the full\r\ndetails he gave shows this to have been a large château, no doubt the\r\nhome of some wealthy local magnate, where above two hundred persons could\r\nassemble. Isobel Young, Christian Grinton, and two or three other witches\r\nentertained the Devil in Young’s house in 1629. Alexander Hamilton,\r\na “known warlock” executed at Edinburgh in 1630, confessed that “the\r\npannel took him one night to a den betwixt Niddrie and Edmiston, where\r\nthe devill had trysted hir.” Helen Guthrie, a Forfar witch, and her\r\ncoven frequented a churchyard, where they met a demon, and on another\r\noccasion they “went to Mary Rynd’s house, and sat doune together at the\r\ntable ... and made them selfes mirrie, and the divell made much of them\r\nall” (1661). The Lancashire witches often held their local Sabbat at\r\nMalking Tower. From the confession of the Swedish witches (1670) at Mohra\r\nand Elfdale they assembled at a spot called _Blockula_ “scituated in a\r\ndelicate large Meadow.... The place or house they met at, had before it\r\na Gate painted with divers colours; ... In a huge large Room of this\r\nHouse, they said, there stood a very long Table, at which the Witches did\r\nsit down; And that hard by this Room was another Chamber in which there\r\nwere very lovely and delicate Beds.”[14] Obviously a fine Swedish country\r\nhouse, perhaps belonging to a wealthy witch, and in the minds of the\r\npoorer members of the gang it presently became imaginatively exaggerated\r\nand described.\r\n\r\nChristian Stridtheckh _De Sagis_ (XL) writes: “They have different\r\nrendezvous in different districts; yet their meetings are generally held\r\nin wooded spots, or on mountains, or in caves, and any places which are\r\nfar from the usual haunts of men. Mela, Book III, chapter 44, mentions\r\nMount Atlas; _de Vaulx_, a warlock executed at Etaples in 1603, confessed\r\nthat the witches of the Low Countries were wont most frequently to meet\r\nin some spot in the province of Utrecht. In our own country, the Mountain\r\nof the Bructeri, which some call Melibœus, in the duchy of Brunswick, is\r\nknown and notorious as the haunt of witches. In the common tongue this\r\nMountain is called the _Blocksberg_ or _Heweberg_, _Brockersburg_ or\r\n_Vogelsberg_, as _Ortelius_ notes in his _Thesaurus Geographicus_.”[15]\r\nThe day of the week whereon a Sabbat was held differed in the various\r\ndistricts and countries, although Friday seems to have been most\r\ngenerally favoured. There is indeed an accumulation of evidence for every\r\nnight of the week save Saturday and Sunday. De Lancre records that in\r\nthe Basses-Pyrénées “their usual rendezvous is the spot known as Lane du\r\nBouc, in the Basque tongue _Aquelarre de verros, prado del Cabron_, &\r\nthere the Sorcerers assemble to worship their master on three particular\r\nnights, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.”[16] Boguet says that the day of\r\nthe Sabbat varied, but usually a Thursday night was preferred.[17] In\r\nEngland it was stated that the “Solemn appointments, and meetings ... are\r\nordinarily on Tuesday or Wednesday night.”[18] Saturday was, however,\r\nparticularly avoided as being the day sacred to the immaculate Mother of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the hysterical and obscene ravings of Maria de Sains, a\r\nwitness concerned in the trial of Louis Gaufridi and who was examined\r\non 17-19 May, 1614, assert that the Sabbat used to be held on every day\r\nof the week. Wednesday and Friday were the Sabbats of blasphemy and the\r\nblack ass. To the other days the most hideous abominations of which\r\nhumanity is capable were allotted. The woman was obviously sexually\r\nderanged, affected with mania blasphematoria and coprolalia.\r\n\r\nNight was almost invariably the time for the Sabbat, although, as Delrio\r\nsays, there is no actual reason why these evil rites should not be\r\nperformed at noon, for the Psalmist speaks of “the terror of the night,”\r\nthe “business that walketh about in the dark,” and of “the noonday\r\ndevil.”[19] (“Non timebis a timore nocturno ... a negotio perambulante\r\nin tenebris; ab incursu et dæmonio meridiano.”) And so Delrio very aptly\r\nwrites: “Their assemblies generally are held at dead of night when the\r\nPowers of Darkness reign; or, sometimes, at high noon, even as the\r\nPsalmist saith, when he speaks of ‘the noonday devil.’ The nights they\r\nprefer are Monday and Thursday.”[20]\r\n\r\nThe time at which these Sabbats began was generally upon the stroke\r\nof midnight. “Les Sorciers,” says Boguet, “vont enuiron la minuict\r\nau Sabbat.”[21] It may be remembered that in the _Metamorphoseon_ of\r\nApuleius, I, xi, the hags attack Socrates at night “circa tertiam\r\nferme uigiliam.” Agnes Sampson, “a famous witch”—as Hume of Godscroft\r\nin his Account of Archibald, ninth Earl of Angus, calls her—commonly\r\nknown as the wise wife of Keith, who made a prominent figure[22] in\r\nthe Fian trials, 1590, confessed that the Devil met her, “being alone,\r\nand commanded her to be at North-Berwick Kirk the next night,” and\r\naccordingly she made her way there as she was bid “and lighted at the\r\nKirk-yard, or a little before she came to it, about eleven hours at\r\neven.”[23] In this case, however, the Sabbat was preceded by a dance\r\nof nearly one hundred persons, and so probably did not commence until\r\nmidnight. Thomas Leyis, Issobell Coky, Helen Fraser, Bessie Thorn, and\r\nthe rest of the Aberdeen witches, thirteen of whom were executed in\r\n1597, and seven more banished, generally met “betuixt tuell & ane houris\r\nat nycht.”[24] Boguet notes that in 1598 the witch Françoise Secretain\r\n“adioustoit qu’elle alloit tousiours au Sabbat enuiron la minuit, &\r\nbeaucoup d’autres sorciers, que i’ay eu en main, ont dit le mesme.” In\r\n1600 Anna Mauczin of Tubingen confessed that she had taken part in witch\r\ngatherings which she dubbed _Hochzeiten_. They seem to have been held by\r\na well just outside the upper gate of Rotenburg, and her evidence insists\r\nupon “midnight dances” and revelling. A Scotch witch, Marie Lamont, “a\r\nyoung woman of the adge of Eighteen Yeares, dwelling in the parish of\r\nInnerkip” on 4 March, 1662, confessed most ingenuously “that when shee\r\nhad been at a mietting sine Zowle last, with other witches, in the night,\r\nthe devill convoyed her home in the dawing.”[25]\r\n\r\nThe Sabbat lasted till cock-crow, before which time none of the assembly\r\nwas suffered to withdraw, and the advowal of Louis Gaufridi, executed at\r\nAix, 1610, seems somewhat singular: “I was conveyed to the place where\r\nthe Sabbat was to be held, and I remained there sometimes one, two,\r\nthree, or four hours, for the most part just as I felt inclined.”[26]\r\nThat the crowing of a cock dissolves enchantments is a tradition of\r\nextremest antiquity. The Jews believed that the clapping of a cock’s\r\nwings will make the power of demons ineffectual and break magic spells.\r\nSo Prudentius sang: “They say that the night-wandering demons, who\r\nrejoice in dunnest shades, at the crowing of the cock tremble and scatter\r\nin sore affright.”[27] The rites of Satan ceased because the Holy\r\nOffice of the Church began. In the time of S. Benedict Matins and Lauds\r\nwere recited at dawn and were actually often known as _Gallicinium_,\r\nCock-crow. In the exquisite poetry of S. Ambrose, which is chanted at\r\nSunday Lauds, the praises of the cock are beautifully sung:\r\n\r\n    Light of our darksome journey here,\r\n      With days dividing night from night!\r\n    Loud crows the dawn’s shrill harbinger,\r\n      And wakens up the sunbeams bright.\r\n\r\n    Forthwith at this, the darkness chill\r\n      Retreats before the star of morn;\r\n    And from their busy schemes of ill\r\n      The vagrant crews of night return.\r\n\r\n    Fresh hope, at this, the sailor cheers;\r\n      The waves their stormy strife allay;\r\n    The Church’s Rock at this, in tears,\r\n      Hastens to wash his guilt away.\r\n\r\n    Arise ye, then, with one accord!\r\n      No longer wrapt in slumber lie;\r\n    The cock rebukes all who their Lord\r\n      By sloth neglect, by sin deny.\r\n\r\n    At his clear cry joy springs afresh;\r\n      Health courses through the sick man’s veins;\r\n    The dagger glides into its sheath;\r\n      The fallen soul her faith regains.[28]\r\n\r\nA witch named Latoma confessed to Nicolas Remy that cocks were most\r\nhateful to all sorcerers. That bird is the herald of dawn, he arouses men\r\nto the worship of God; and many an odious sin which darkness shrouds will\r\nbe revealed in the light of the coming day. At the hour of the Nativity,\r\nthat most blessed time, the cocks crew all night long. A cock crew\r\nlustily at the Resurrection. Hence is the cock placed upon the steeple\r\nof churches. Pliny and Ælian tell us that a lion fears the cock; so the\r\nDevil “leo rugiens” flees at cock-crow.\r\n\r\n“Le coq,” says De Lancre, “s’oyt par fois es Sabbats sonna̅t la retraicte\r\naux Sorciers.”[29]\r\n\r\nThe witch resorted to the Sabbat in various manners. If it were a\r\nquestion of attending a local assembly when, at most, a mile or two had\r\nto be traversed, the company would go on foot. Very often the distance\r\nwas even less, for it should be remembered that in the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries, and indeed, as a matter of fact, up to a quite\r\nrecent date, when the wayfarer had gone a few steps outside the gates\r\nof a town or beyond the last house in the village he was enfolded in\r\ndarkness, entirely solitary, remote, eloined. If footmen with flambeaux,\r\nat least the humbler linkboy, were essential attendants after nightfall\r\nin the streets of the world’s great cities, London, Rome, Paris,\r\nMadrid,[30] how black with shadows, dangerous, and utterly lonesome\r\nwas the pathless countryside! Not infrequently the witches of necessity\r\ncarried lanterns to light them on their journey to the Sabbat. The\r\nlearned Bartolomeo de Spina, O.P.,[31] in his _Tractatus de Strigibus\r\net Lamiis_ (Venice, 1533), writes that a certain peasant, who lived at\r\nClavica Malaguzzi, in the district of Mirandola, having occasion to rise\r\nvery early one morning and drive to a neighbouring village, found himself\r\nat three o’clock, before daybreak, crossing a waste tract of considerable\r\nextent which lay between him and his destination. In the distance he\r\nsuddenly caught sight of what seemed to be numerous fires flitting to\r\nand fro, and as he drew nearer he saw that these were none other than\r\nlarge lanthorns held by a bevy of persons who were moving here and there\r\nin the mazes of a fantastic dance, whilst others, as at a rustic picnic,\r\nwere seated partaking of dainties and drinking stoups of wine, what time\r\na harsh music, like the scream of a cornemuse, droned through the air.\r\nCuriously no word was spoken, the company whirled and pirouetted, ate\r\nand drank, in strange and significant silence. Perceiving that many,\r\nunabashed, were giving themselves up to the wildest debauchery and\r\npublicly performing the sexual act with every circumstance of indecency,\r\nthe horrified onlooker realized that he was witnessing the revels of\r\nthe Sabbat. Crossing himself fervently and uttering a prayer he drove\r\nas fast as possible from the accursed spot, not, however, before he had\r\nrecognized some of the company as notorious evil-doers and persons living\r\nin the vicinity who were already under grave suspicion of sorcery. The\r\nwitches must have remarked his presence, but they seem to have ignored\r\nhim and not even to have attempted pursuit. In another instance Fra\r\nPaolo de Caspan, a Dominican of great reputation for piety and learning,\r\nreports that Antonio de Palavisini, the parish priest of Caspan in the\r\nValtellina, a territory infected with warlocks, most solemnly affirmed\r\nthat when going before daybreak to say an early Mass at a shrine hard by\r\nthe village he had seen through clearings in the wood an assembly of men\r\nand women furnished with lanterns, who were seated in a circle and whose\r\nactions left no doubt that they were witches engaged in abominable rites.\r\nIn both the above cases the lanterns were not required in the ceremonies\r\nof the Sabbat, and they must have been carried for the purely practical\r\npurpose of affording light.\r\n\r\nVery often when going to a local Sabbat the coven of witches used to\r\nmeet just beyond the village and make their way to the appointed spot in\r\na body for mutual help and security. This is pointed out by Bernard of\r\nComo, a famous scholar, who says: “When they are to go to some spot hard\r\nby they proceed thither on foot cheerily conversing as they walk.”[32]\r\nThe fact that the dark initiates walked to the Sabbat is frequently\r\nmentioned in the trials. Boguet, who is most exact in detail, writes:\r\n“Sorcerers, nevertheless, sometimes walk to the Sabbat, and this is\r\ngenerally the case when the spot where they are to assemble does not lie\r\nvery far from their dwellings.”[33] And in the interrogatory, 17 May,\r\n1616, of Barthélemi Minguet of Brécy, a young fellow of twenty-five,\r\naccused with seventeen more, we have: “He was then asked in what place\r\nthe Sabbat was held the last time he was present there.\r\n\r\n“He replied that it was in the direction of Billcron, at a cross-road\r\nwhich is on the high-road leading to Aix, in the Parish of Saint\r\nSoulange. He was asked how he proceeded thither. He replied that he\r\nwalked to the place.”[34]\r\n\r\nWhen Catharine Oswald of Niddrie (1625) one night took Alexander Hamilton\r\n“a known warlock” “to a den betwixt Niddrie and Edmiston, where the\r\ndevill had trysted hir,” it is obvious that the couple walked there\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the truly subtle point was raised whether those who\r\nwalked to the Sabbat were as guilty as those who were conveyed thither by\r\nthe Devil. But De Lancre decides: “It is truly as criminal & abominable\r\nfor a Sorcerer to go to the Sabbat on foot as to be voluntarily conveyed\r\nthither by the Devil.”[35]\r\n\r\nMajor Weir and his sister seem to have gone to a meeting with the\r\nDevil in a coach and six horses when they thus drove from Edinburgh to\r\nMusselburgh and back again on 7 September, 1648. So the woman confessed\r\nin prison, and added “that she and her brother had made a compact with\r\nthe devil.”[36]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV\r\n\r\nOFF TO THE SABBAT. Queverdo\r\n\r\n[_face p. 120_]\r\n\r\nAgnes Sampson, the famous witch of North Berwick (1590), confessed “that\r\nthe _Devil_ in mans lickness met her going out to the fields from her\r\nown house at _Keith_, betwixt five and six at even, being alone and\r\ncommanded her to be at _North-berwick_ Kirk the next night. To which\r\nplace she came on horse-back, conveyed by her Good-son, called Iohn\r\nCouper.”[37] The Swedish witches (1669) who carried children off to\r\nBlockula “set them upon a _Beast_ of the _Devil’s_ providing, and then\r\nthey rid away.” One boy confessed that “to perform the Journey, he took\r\nhis own Fathers horse out of the Meadow, where it was feeding.”[38] Upon\r\nhis return one of the coven let the horse graze in her own pasture, and\r\nhere the boy’s father found it the next day.\r\n\r\nIn the popular imagination the witch is always associated with the\r\nbroomstick, employed by her to fly in wild career through mid-air. This\r\nbelief seems almost universal, of all times and climes. The broomstick\r\nis, of course, closely connected with the magic wand or staff which was\r\nconsidered equally serviceable for purposes of equitation. The wood\r\nwhence it was fashioned was often from the hazel-tree, witch-hazel,\r\nalthough in De Lancre’s day the sorcerers of Southern France favoured the\r\n“Souhandourra”—_Cornus sanguinea_, dog-wood. Mid hurricane and tempest,\r\nin the very heart of the dark storm, the convoy of witches, straddling\r\ntheir broomsticks, sped swiftly along to the Sabbat, their yells and\r\nhideous laughter sounding louder than the crash of elements and mingling\r\nin fearsome discord with the frantic pipe of the gale.\r\n\r\nThere is a very important reference to these beliefs from the pen of the\r\nfamous and erudite Benedictine Abbot, Regino of Prüm (A.D. 906), who in\r\nhis weighty _De ecclesiasticis disciplinis_ writes: “This too must by\r\nno means be passed over that certain utterly abandoned women, turning\r\naside to follow Satan, being seduced by the illusions and phantasmical\r\nshows of demons firmly believe and openly profess that in the dead of\r\nnight they ride upon certain beasts along with the pagan goddess Diana\r\nand a countless horde of women, and that in those silent hours they\r\nfly over vast tracts of country and obey her as their mistress, whilst\r\non certain other nights they are summoned to do her homage and pay\r\nher service.”[39] The witches rode sometimes upon a besom or a stick,\r\nsometimes upon an animal, and the excursion through the air was generally\r\npreceded by an unction with a magic ointment. Various recipes are given\r\nfor the ointment, and it is interesting to note that they contain\r\ndeadly poisons: aconite, belladonna, and hemlock.[40] Although these\r\nunguents may in certain circumstances be capable of producing definite\r\nphysiological results, it is Delrio who best sums up the reasons for\r\ntheir use: “The Demon is able to convey them to the Sabbat without the\r\nuse of any unguent, and often he does so. But for several reasons he\r\nprefers that they should anoint themselves. Sometimes when the witches\r\nseem afraid it serves to encourage them. When they are young and tender\r\nthey will thus be better able to bear the hateful embrace of Satan who\r\nhas assumed the shape of a man. For by this horrid anointing he dulls\r\ntheir senses and persuades these deluded wretches that there is some\r\ngreat virtue in the viscid lubricant. Sometimes too he does this in\r\nhateful mockery of God’s holy Sacraments, and that by these mysterious\r\nceremonies he may infuse, as it were, something of a ritual and\r\nliturgical nature into his beastly orgies.”[41]\r\n\r\nAlthough the witch is universally credited with the power to fly through\r\nthe air[42] to the Sabbat mounted upon a besom or some kind of stick, it\r\nis remarkable in the face of popular belief to find that the confessions\r\navowing this actual mode of aerial transport are extraordinarily few.\r\nPaul Grilland, in his tractate _De Sortilegiis_ (Lyons, 1533), speaks of\r\na witch at Rome during whose trial, seven years before, it was asserted\r\nshe flew in the air after she had anointed her limbs with a magic\r\nliniment. Perhaps the most exactly detailed accounts of this feat are to\r\nbe found in Boguet,[43] than whom scarcely any writer more meticulously\r\nreports the lengthy and prolix evidence of witches, such evidence as he\r\nso laboriously gathered during the notorious prosecutions throughout\r\nFranche-Comté in the summer of 1598. He records quite plainly such\r\nstatements as: “Françoise Secretain disoit, que pour aller au Sabbat,\r\nelle mettoit un baston blanc entre ses iambes & puis prononçait certaines\r\nparoles & dés lors elle estoit portée par l’air iusques en l’assemblée\r\ndes Sorciers.” (Françoise Secretain avowed that in order to go to the\r\nSabbat she placed a white stick between her legs & then uttered certain\r\nwords & then she was borne through the air to the sorcerers’ assembly).\r\nIn another place she confessed “qu’elle avoit esté vne infinité de fois\r\nau Sabbat ... & qu’elle y alloit sur vn baston blanc, qu’elle mettoit\r\nentre ses iambes.” (That she had been a great number of times to the\r\nSabbat ... and that she went there on a white stick which she placed\r\nbetween her legs.) It will be noticed that in the second instance she\r\ndoes not explicitly claim to have been borne through the air. Again:\r\n“Françoise Secretain y estoit portée [au Sabbat] sur vn baston blanc.\r\nSatan y tra̅sporta Thieuenne Paget & Antide Colas estant en forme d’vn\r\nhomme noir, sortans de leurs maison le plus souuent par la cheminée.”\r\n“Claudine Boban, ieune fille confessa qu’elle & sa mère montoient sur vne\r\nramasse, & que sortans le contremont de la cheminée elles alloient par\r\nl’air en ceste façon au Sabbat.” (Françoise Secretain was carried [to the\r\nSabbat] on a white stick. Satan, in the form of a tall dark man conveyed\r\nthither Thieuenne Paget & Antide Colas, who most often left their house\r\nby way of the chimney.... Claudine Boban, a young girl, confessed that\r\nboth she and her mother mounted on a besom, & that flying out by the\r\nchimney they were thus borne through the air to the Sabbat.) A marginal\r\nnote explains _ramasse_ as “autrement balai, & en Lyonnois coiue.”\r\n\r\nGlanvill writes that Julian Cox, one of the Somerset coven (1665), said\r\n“that one evening she walkt out about a Mile from her own House and\r\nthere came riding towards her three persons upon three Broom-staves,\r\nborn up about a yard and a half from the ground. Two of them she\r\nformerly knew, which was a Witch and a Wizzard.” It might easily be\r\nthat there is some exaggeration here. We know that a figure in one of\r\nthe witch dances consisted of leaping as high as possible into the air,\r\nand probably the three persons seen by Julian Cox were practising this\r\nagile step. A quotation from Bodin by Reginald Scot is very pertinent in\r\nthis connexion. Speaking of the Sabbat revels he has: “And whiles they\r\nsing and dance, euerie one hath a broome in his hand, and holdeth it vp\r\naloft. Item he saith, that these night-walking or rather night-dansing\r\nwitches, brought out of _Italie_ into _France_, that danse which is\r\ncalled _La Volta_.”[44] Sir John Davies in his _Orchestra or A Poeme on\r\nDauncing_ (18mo, 1596) describes the lavolta as “A loftie iumping, or a\r\nleaping round.” De Lancre observes that after the regular country dance\r\nat the Sabbat the witches sprang high into the air. “Après la dance ils\r\nse mettent par fois à sauter.”[45] At their assembly certain of the\r\nAberdeen witches (1597) “danced a devilish dance, riding on trees, by a\r\nlong space.” In an old representation of Dr. Fian and his company swiftly\r\npacing round North Berwick church withershins the witches are represented\r\nas running and leaping in the air, some mounted on broomsticks, some\r\ncarrying their besoms in their hands.\r\n\r\nThere was discovered in the closet of Dame Alice Kyteler of Kilkenny, who\r\nwas arrested in 1324 upon the accusation of nightly meeting a familiar\r\nArtisson and multiplied charges of sorcery, a pipe of ointment, wherewith\r\nshe greased a staff “upon which she ambolled and gallopped thorough\r\nthicke and thin, when and what manner she listed.”[46] In the trial of\r\nMartha Carrier, a notorious witch and “rampant hag” at the Court of Oyer\r\nand Terminer, held by adjournment at Salem, 2 August, 1692, the eighth\r\narticle of the indictment ran: “One _Foster_, who confessed her own share\r\nin the Witchcraft for which the Prisoner stood indicted, affirm’d, that\r\nshe had seen the prisoner at some of their _Witch-meetings_, and that it\r\nwas this _Carrier_, who perswaded her to be a Witch. She confessed that\r\nthe Devil carry’d them on a pole, to a Witch-meeting: but the pole broke,\r\nand she hanging about _Carriers_ neck, they both fell down, and she then\r\nreceived an hurt by the Fall, whereof she was not at this very time\r\nrecovered.”[47]\r\n\r\nIn many of these instances it is plain that there is no actual flight\r\nthrough the air implied; although there is a riding a-cock-horse of\r\nbrooms or sticks, in fact, a piece of symbolic ritual.\r\n\r\nIt is very pertinent, however, to notice in this connexion the actual\r\nlevitation of human beings, which is, although perhaps an unusual, yet\r\nby no means an unknown, phenomenon in the séances of modern spiritism,\r\nwhere both the levitation of persons, with which we are solely concerned,\r\nand the rising of tables or chairs off the ground without contact with\r\nany individual or by any human agency have occurred again and again\r\nunder conditions which cannot possibly admit of legerdemain, illusion,\r\nor charlatanry. From a mass of irrefutable evidence we may select some\r\nstriking words by Sir William Crookes, F.R.S., upon levitation. “This\r\nhas occurred,” he writes, “in my presence on four occasions in darkness;\r\nbut ... I will only mention cases in which deductions of reason were\r\nconfirmed by the sense of sight.... On one occasion I witnessed a chair,\r\nwith a lady sitting on it, rise several inches from the ground.... On\r\nanother occasion the lady knelt on the chair in such manner that the\r\nfour feet were visible to us. It then rose about three inches, remained\r\nsuspended for about ten seconds, and then slowly descended....\r\n\r\n“The most striking case of levitation which I have witnessed has been\r\nwith Mr. Home. On three separate occasions have I seen him raised\r\ncompletely from the floor of the room.... On each occasion I had full\r\nopportunity of watching the occurrence as it was taking place. There\r\nare at least a hundred recorded instances of Mr. Home’s rising from the\r\nground.”[48]\r\n\r\nWriting in July, 1871, Lord Lindsay said: “I was sitting with Mr. Home\r\nand Lord Adare and a cousin of his. During the sitting Mr. Home went\r\ninto a trance, and in that state was carried out of the window in the\r\nroom next to where we were, and was brought in at our window. The\r\ndistance between the windows was about seven feet six inches, and there\r\nwas not the slightest foothold between them, nor was there more than a\r\ntwelve-inch projection to each window, which served as a ledge to put\r\nflowers on. We heard the window in the next room lifted up, and almost\r\nimmediately after we saw Home floating in air outside our window.”[49]\r\n\r\nWilliam Stainton Moses writes of his levitation in August, 1872, in the\r\npresence of credible witnesses: “I was carried up ... when I became\r\nstationary I made a mark [with a lead pencil] on the wall opposite to my\r\nchest. This mark is as near as may be six feet from the floor.... From\r\nthe position of the mark on the wall it is clear that my head must have\r\nbeen close to the ceiling.... I was simply levitated and lowered to my\r\nold place.”[50]\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the lives of the Saints we find that these manifestations\r\nhave been frequently observed, and it will suffice to mention but a few\r\nfrom innumerable examples.\r\n\r\nS. Francis of Assisi was often “suspended above the earth, sometimes\r\nto a height of three, sometimes to a height of four cubits”; the\r\nsame phenomenon has been recorded by eye-witnesses in many instances\r\nthroughout the centuries. Among the large number of those who are\r\nknown to have been raised from the ground whilst wrapt in prayer are\r\nthe stigmatized S. Catherine of Siena; S. Colette; Rainiero de Borgo\r\nSan-Sepolcro; S. Catherine de Ricci; S. Alphonsus Rodriguez, S.J.;\r\nS. Mary Magdalen de Pazzi; Raimond Rocco; Bl. Charles de Sezze; S.\r\nVeronica Giuliani the Capuchiness; S. Gerard Majella, the Redemptorist\r\nthaumaturge; that wondrous mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich; Dominica\r\nBarbagli (died in 1858), the ecstatica of Montesanto-Savino (Florence),\r\nwhose levitations were of daily occurrence. S. Ignatius Loyola whilst\r\ndeeply contemplative was seen by John Pascal to be raised more than a\r\nfoot from the pavement; S. Teresa and S. John of the Cross were levitated\r\nin concurrent ecstasies in the shady locutorio of the Encarnacion, as\r\nwas witnessed by Beatriz of Jesus and the whole convent of nuns;[51]\r\nS. Alphonsus Liguori whilst preaching in the church of S. John Baptist\r\nat Foggia was lifted before the eyes of the whole congregation several\r\nfeet from the ground;[52] Gemma Galgani of Lucca, who died 11 April,\r\n1903, was observed whilst praying one evening in September, 1901, before\r\na venerated Crucifix, to rise in the air in a celestial trance and to\r\nremain several minutes at some distance from the floor.[53] Above all,\r\nS. Joseph of Cupertino (1603-63), one of the most extraordinary mystics\r\nof the seventeenth century, whose whole life seemed one long series of\r\nunbroken raptures and ecstasies, was frequently lifted on high to remain\r\nsuspended in mid-air. Such notice was attracted by this marvel that his\r\nsuperiors sent him from one lonely house of Capuchins or Conventuals\r\nto another, and he died at the little hill town of Osimo, where his\r\nremains are yet venerated. For many years he was obliged to say Mass\r\nat a private altar so inevitable were the ecstasies that fell upon him\r\nduring the Sacrifice. There are, I think, few sanctuaries more sweet and\r\nmore fragrant with holiness than this convent at Osimo. During a most\r\nhappy visit to the shrine of S. Joseph I was deeply touched by the many\r\nmemorials of the Saints, and by the kindness of the Fathers, his brethren\r\nto-day. S. Philip Neri and S. Francis Xavier were frequently raised from\r\nthe ground at the Elevation, and of the ascetic S. Paul of the Cross\r\nthe Blessed Strambi writes: “Le serviteur de Dieu s’éleva en l’air à\r\nla hauteur de deux palmes, et cela, à deux reprises, avant et après\r\nla consecration.”[54] (The servant of God during Holy Mass was twice\r\nelevated in the air to a height of two hand-breadths from the ground\r\nboth before and after the Consecration.) It is well known that in a\r\ncertain London church a holy religious when he said Mass was not unseldom\r\nlevitated from the predella, which manifestation I have myself witnessed,\r\nalthough the father was himself unconscious thereof until the day of his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut, as Görres most aptly remarks,[55] although many examples may be\r\ncited of Saints who have been levitated in ecstasy, and although it is\r\nnot impossible that this phenomenon may be imitated by evil powers—as,\r\nindeed, it undoubtedly is in the cases of spiritistic mediums—yet nowhere\r\ndo we find in hagiography that a large number of Saints were in one\r\ncompany raised from the earth together or conveyed through the air to\r\nmeet at some appointed spot. Is it likely, then, that the demons would\r\nbe allowed seemingly to excel by their power a most extraordinary and\r\nexceptional manifestation? It must be remembered, also, that save in very\r\nrare and singular instances, such as that of S. Joseph of Cupertino,\r\nlevitation is only for a height of a foot or some eighteen inches, and\r\neven this occurs seldom save at moments of great solemnity and psychic\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\nA question which is largely discussed by the demonologists then arises:\r\nDo the witches actually and in person attend the Sabbat or is their\r\njourney thither and assistance thereat mere diabolic illusion? Giovanni\r\nFrancesco Ponzinibio, in his _De Lamiis_,[56] wholly inclines to the\r\nlatter view, but this is superficial reasoning, and the celebrated\r\ncanonist Francisco Peña with justice takes him very severely to task for\r\nhis temerity. Peña’s profound work, _In Bernardi Comensis Dominicani\r\nLucernam inquisitorum notæ et eiusdem tractatum de strigibus_,[57]\r\na valuable collection of most erudite glosses, entirely disposes of\r\nPonzinibio’s arguments, and puts the case in words of weighty authority.\r\n\r\nSprenger in the _Malleus Maleficarum_, I, had already considered\r\n“How witches are bodily transported from one place to another,”\r\nand he concludes “It is proven, then, that sorcerers can be bodily\r\ntransported.”[58] Paul Grilland inquires: “Whether magicians & witches\r\nor Satanists are bodily & actually conveyed to and fro by the Devil,\r\nor whether this be merely imaginary?” He freely acknowledges the\r\nextraordinary difficulty and intricacy of the investigation, beginning\r\nhis answer with the phrase “Quæstio ista est multum ardua et famosa.”[59]\r\n(This is a very difficult and oft-discussed question.) But S. Augustine,\r\nS. Thomas, S. Bonaventure, and a score of great names are agreed upon the\r\nreality of this locomotion, and Grilland, after balancing the evidence to\r\nthe nicety of a hair wisely concludes: “Myself I hold the opinion that\r\nthey are actually transported.”[60]\r\n\r\nIn his _Compendium Maleficarum_ Francesco Maria Guazzo discusses (Liber\r\nI. 13) “Whether Witches are actually and bodily conveyed from place\r\nto place to attend their Sabbats”; and lays down: “The opinion which\r\nmany who follow Luther & Melancthon hold is that Witches only assist at\r\nthese assemblies in their imagination, & that they are choused by some\r\ntrick of the devil, in support of which argument the objectors assert\r\nthat the Witches have very often been seen lying in one spot and not\r\nmoving thence. Moreover, what is related in the life of S. Germain is\r\nnot impertinent in this connexion, to wit, when certain women declared\r\nthat they had been present at a banquet, & yet all the while they\r\nslumbered and slept, as several persons attested. That women of this\r\nkind are very often deceived in such a way is certain; but that they\r\nare always so deceived is by no means sure.... The alternative opinion,\r\nwhich personally I hold most strongly, is that sometimes at any rate\r\nWitches are actually conveyed from one place to another by the Devil,\r\nwho under the bodily form of a goat or some other unclean & monstrous\r\nanimal himself carries them, & that they are verily and indeed present at\r\ntheir foul midnight Sabbats. This opinion is that generally held by the\r\nauthoritative Theologians and Master Jurisprudists of Italy and Spain,\r\nas also by the Catholic divines and legalists. The majority of writers,\r\nindeed, advance this view, for example, Torquemada in his commentary\r\non Grilland, Remy, S. Peter Damian, Silvester of Abula, Tommaso de\r\nVio Gaetani, Alfonso de Castro, Sisto da Siena, O.P., Père Crespet,\r\nBartolomeo Spina in his glosses on Ponzinibio, Lorenzo Anania, and a vast\r\nnumber of others, whose names for brevity’s sake I here omit.”[61]\r\n\r\nThis seems admirably to sum up the whole matter. In the encyclopædic\r\ntreatise _De Strigibus_[62] by an earlier authority, Bernard of Como, the\r\nfollowing remarkable passage occurs: “The aforesaid abominable wretches\r\nactually & awake & in full enjoyment of their normal senses attend these\r\nassemblies or rather orgies, and when they are to go to some spot hard\r\nby they proceed thither on foot, cheerily conversing as they walk. If,\r\nhowever, they are to meet in some distant place then are they conveyed by\r\nthe Devil, yet by whatsoever means they proceed to the said place whether\r\nit be on foot or whether they are borne along by the Devil, it is most\r\ncertain that their journey is real and actual, and not imaginary. Nor\r\nare they labouring under any delusion when they deny the Catholic Faith,\r\nworship and adore the Devil, tread upon the Cross of Christ, outrage the\r\nMost Blessed Sacrament, and give themselves up to filthy and unhallowed\r\ncopulations, fornicating with the Devil himself who appears to them in a\r\nhuman form, being used by the men as a succubus, & carnally serving the\r\nwoman as an incubus.”[63]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion then is plain and proven. The witches do actually and\r\nindividually attend the Sabbat, an orgy of blasphemy and obscenity.\r\nWhether they go thither on foot, or horseback, or by some other means is\r\na detail, which in point of fact differs according to the several and\r\ninfinitely varied circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not denied that in some cases hallucination and self-deception\r\nplayed a large part, but such examples are comparatively speaking few\r\nin number, and these, moreover, were carefully investigated and most\r\nfrequently recognized by the judges and divines. Thus in the _Malleus\r\nMaleficarum_ Sprenger relates that a woman, who had voluntarily\r\nsurrendered herself to be examined as being a witch, confessed to the\r\nDominican fathers that she nightly assisted at the Sabbat, and that\r\nneither bolts nor bars could prevent her from flying to the infernal\r\nrevels. Accordingly she was shut fast under lock and key in a chamber\r\nwhence it was impossible for her to escape, and all the while carefully\r\nwatched by lynx-eyed officers through a secret soupirail. These reported\r\nthat immediately the door was closed she threw herself on the bed where\r\nin a moment she was stretched out perfectly rigid in all her members.\r\nSelect members of the tribunal, grave and acute doctors, entered the\r\nroom. They shook her, gently at first, but presently with considerable\r\nroughness. She remained immobile and insensible. She was pinched and\r\npulled sharply. At last a lighted candle was brought and placed near\r\nher naked foot until the flesh was actually scorched in the flame. She\r\nlay stockish and still, dumb and motionless as a stone. After a while\r\nher senses returned to her. She sat up and related in exact detail the\r\nhappenings at the Sabbat she had attended, the place, the number of the\r\ncompany, the rites, what was spoken, all that was done, and then she\r\ncomplained of a hurt upon her foot. Next day the fathers explained to her\r\nall that had passed, how that she had never stirred from the spot, and\r\nthat the pain arose from the taper which to ensure the experiment had\r\nbeen brought in contact with her flesh. They admonished her straightly\r\nbut with paternal charity, and upon the humble confession of her error\r\nand a promise to guard against any such ill fantasies for the future, a\r\nsuitable penance was prescribed and the woman dismissed.\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated cases investigated by Henri Boguet, June, 1598, young\r\nGeorge Gandillon confessed to having walked to the Sabbat at a deserted\r\nspot called Fontenelles, near the village of Nezar, and also to having\r\nridden to the Sabbat. Moreover, in his indictment the following occurs:\r\n“George Gandillon, one Good Friday night, lay in his bed, rigid as a\r\ncorpse, for the space of three hours, & then on a sudden came to himself.\r\nHe has since been burned alive here with his father & his sister.”[64]\r\n\r\nSince Boguet, who is one of our chief authorities, discusses the Sabbat\r\nwith most copious details in his _Discours des Sorciers_ it will not be\r\nimpertinent to give here the headings and subdivisions of his learned and\r\namply documented chapters.[65]\r\n\r\n    Chapter XVI. How, & in what way Sorcerers are conveyed to the\r\n    Sabbat.\r\n\r\n        1. _They are sometimes conveyed there mounted on a stick,\r\n        or a broom, sometimes on a sheep or a goat, & sometimes by\r\n        a tall black man._\r\n\r\n        2. _Sometimes they anoint themselves with ointment, &\r\n        sometimes not._\r\n\r\n        3. _There are some people, who although they are not\r\n        Sorcerers, if they are anointed, are none the less carried\r\n        off to the Sabbat. The reason for this._\r\n\r\n        4. _The unguent, & the ointment are actually of no use\r\n        to the Sorcerers, and do not in effect carry them to the\r\n        Sabbat._\r\n\r\n        5. _Sorcerers are sometimes conveyed to the Sabbat by a\r\n        blast of wind & a sudden storm._\r\n\r\n    Chapter XVII. Sorcerers may sometimes walk to the Sabbat on\r\n    foot.\r\n\r\n    Chapter XVIII. Is the journey of Sorcerers to the Sabbat merely\r\n    imagination?\r\n\r\n        1 & 3. _Reasons for supposing this to be the case, &\r\n        examples._\r\n\r\n        2. _Indications, owing to which it may be supposed, that a\r\n        certain woman paid a purely imaginary visit to the Sabbat._\r\n\r\n        4. _Reasons for supposing that the journey of Sorcerers to\r\n        the Sabbat, is a real expedition and not imaginary._\r\n\r\n        5. _How we are to understand what is related concerning\r\n        Erichtho, & Apollonius; the first of whom raised a soldier\r\n        to life, & the latter a young girl._\r\n\r\n        6. _Sorcerers cannot raise the dead to life. Examples._\r\n\r\n        7. _Neither can heretics perform miracles. Examples._\r\n\r\n        8. _The Author’s opinion concerning the subject of this\r\n        chapter._\r\n\r\n        9. _Satan most frequently deceives mankind. Examples._\r\n\r\n    Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\n        1. _Sorcerers go to the Sabbat about midnight._\r\n\r\n        2. _The reason why the Sabbat is generally held at night._\r\n\r\n        3. _Satan delights in darkness & blackness, which are\r\n        opposite to the whiteness and light that please Heaven._\r\n\r\n        4. _At the Sabbat Sorcerers dance back to back. For the\r\n        most part they wear masks._\r\n\r\n        5 & 8. _When the cock crows the Sabbat immediately comes to\r\n        an end, and vanishes away. The reason for this._\r\n\r\n        6. _The voice of the cock frightens Satan in the same way\r\n        as it terrifies lions & serpents._\r\n\r\n        7. _Several authors relate that demons fear a naked sword._\r\n\r\n    Chapter XX. The days on which the Sabbat is held.\r\n\r\n        1. _The Sabbat may be held on any day of the week, but\r\n        particularly on a Friday._\r\n\r\n        2. _It is also held on the greatest festivals of the year._\r\n\r\n    Chapter XXI. The places where the Sabbat is held.\r\n\r\n        1. _According to many writers the place where the Sabbat is\r\n        held is distinguished by a clump of trees, or sometimes by\r\n        a cross. The Author’s opinion on this point._\r\n\r\n        2. _A remarkable account of a place where the Sabbat was\r\n        held._\r\n\r\n        3. _There must be water near the place where the Sabbat is\r\n        held. The reason for this._\r\n\r\n        4. _If there is no water in the place, the Sorcerers dig a\r\n        hole in the ground and urinate in this._\r\n\r\n    Chapter XXII. The proceedings at the Sabbat.\r\n\r\n        1. _The Sorcerers worship the Devil who appears under the\r\n        form of a tall black man, or as a goat. They offer him\r\n        candles & kiss his posterior._\r\n\r\n        2. _They dance. A description of their dances._\r\n\r\n        3. _They give themselves up to every kind of filthy\r\n        abomination. The Devil transforms himself into an Incubus &\r\n        into a Succubus._\r\n\r\n        4. _The hideous orgies & foul copulations practised by the\r\n        Euchites, & Gnostics._\r\n\r\n        5. _The Sorcerers feast at the Sabbat. Their meat & their\r\n        drink. The way in which they say grace before and after\r\n        table._\r\n\r\n        6. _However, this food never satisfies their appetites, &\r\n        they always arise from table as hungry as before._\r\n\r\n        7. _When they have finished their meal, they give the Devil\r\n        a full account of all their actions._\r\n\r\n        8. _They again renounce God, their baptism, &c. How Satan\r\n        incites them to do evil._\r\n\r\n        9. _They raise dark storms._\r\n\r\n        10. _They celebrate their mass. Of their vestments, & holy\r\n        water._\r\n\r\n        11. _Sometimes to conclude the Sabbat Satan seems to be\r\n        consumed in a flame of fire, & to be completely reduced to\r\n        ashes. All present take a small part of these ashes, which\r\n        the Sorcerers use for their charms._\r\n\r\n        12. _Satan is always the Ape of God in everything._\r\n\r\nAs the procedure in the various Sabbats differed very greatly according\r\nto century, decade, country, district, nay, even in view of the station\r\nof life and, it would seem, the very temperaments of the assembly,\r\nit is only possible to outline in a general way some of the most\r\nremarkable ceremonies which took place on the occasions of these infernal\r\ncongregations. An intimate and intensive study of the Sabbat would\r\nrequire a large volume, for it is quite possible to reconstruct the rites\r\nin every particular, although the precise order of the ritual was not\r\nalways and everywhere the same.\r\n\r\nDom Calmet, it is true, has very mistakenly said: “To attempt to give\r\na description of the Sabbat, is to attempt a description of what does\r\nnot exist, & what has never existed save in the fantastic & disordered\r\nimagination of warlocks & witches: the pictures which have been drawn of\r\nthese assemblies are merely the phantasy of those who dreamed that they\r\nhad actually been borne, body & soul, through the air to the Sabbat.”[66]\r\nHappy sceptic! But unfortunately the Sabbat did—and does—take place;\r\nformerly in deserted wastes, on the hill-side, in secluded spots, now,\r\nas often as not, in the privacy of vaults and cellars, and in those lone\r\nempty houses innocently placarded “To be Sold.”\r\n\r\nThe President of the Sabbat was in purely local gatherings often the\r\nOfficer of the district; in the more solemn assemblies convened from a\r\nwider area, the Grand Master, whose dignity would be proportionate to\r\nthe numbers of the company and the extent of his province. In any case\r\nthe President was officially known as the “Devil,” and it would seem\r\nthat his immediate attendants and satellites were also somewhat loosely\r\ntermed “devils,” which formal nomenclature has given rise to considerable\r\nconfusion and not a little mystification in the reports of witch trials\r\nand the confessions of offenders. But in many instances it is certain—and\r\northodoxy forbids us to doubt the possibility—that the Principle of\r\nEvil, incarnate, was present for the hideous adoration of his besotted\r\nworshippers. Such is the sense of the Fathers, such is the conclusion\r\nof the theologians who have dealt with these dark abominations.\r\nMetaphysically it is possible; historically it is indisputable.\r\n\r\nWhen a human being, a man, occupied the chief position at these meetings\r\nand directed the performance of the rites, he would sometimes appear\r\nin a hideous and grotesque disguise, sometimes without any attempt at\r\nconcealment. This masquerade generally took the shape of an animal, and\r\nhad its origin in heathendom, whence by an easy transition through the\r\nceremonial of heretics, it passed to the sorcerer and the witch. As early\r\nas the _Liber Pœnitentialis_ of S. Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\n668-690, we have a distinct prohibition of this foul mummery. Capitulum\r\nxxvii denounces the man who “in Kalendas Ianuarii in ceruulo et in uitula\r\nuadit.” “If anyone at the kalends of January goes about as a stag or a\r\nbull; that is making himself into a wild animal and dressing in the skin\r\nof a herd animal, and putting on the head of beasts; those who in such\r\nwise transform themselves into the appearance of a wild animal, penance\r\nfor three years because this is devilish.”\r\n\r\nAmong the many animal forms which the leader of the Sabbat (the “Devil”)\r\nassumed in masquerade the most common are the bull, the cat, and above\r\nall the goat. Thus the Basque term for the Sabbat is “Akhelarre,” “goat\r\npasture.” Sometimes the leader is simply said to have shown himself in\r\nthe shape of a beast, which possibly points to the traditional disguise\r\nof a black hairy skin, horns, hoofs, claws, and a tail, in fact the\r\nsame dress as a demon wore upon the stage.[67] In an old German ballad,\r\n_Druten Zeitung_, printed at Smalcald in 1627, “to be sung to the tune of\r\n_Dorothea_,” it is said that the judges, anxious to extort a confession\r\nfrom a witch, sent down into her twilight dungeon the common hangman\r\ndressed in a bear’s skin with horns, hoofs, and tail complete. The\r\nmiserable prisoner thinking that Lucifer had indeed visited her at once\r\nappealed to him for help:\r\n\r\n    Man shickt ein Henkersnecht\r\n    Zu ihr in Gefängniss n’unter,\r\n      Den man hat kleidet recht,\r\n    Mit einer Bärnhaute,\r\n      Als wenns der Teufel wär;\r\n    Als ihm die Drut anschaute\r\n      Meints ihr Bühl kam daher.\r\n\r\nHere we have a curious and perhaps unique example of the demoniac\r\nmasquerade subtly used to obtain evidence of guilt by a trick. The\r\nAberdeen witch Jonet Lucas (1597) said that the Devil was at the Sabbat\r\n“beand in likenes of ane beist.” But Agnes Wobster of the same company\r\ndeclared that “Satan apperit to them in the likenes of a calff,” so\r\npossibly two masquerades were employed. Gabriel Pellé (1608) confessed\r\nthat he attended a Sabbat presided over by the Devil, and “le Diable\r\nestoit en vache noire.”[68] Françoise Secretain, who was tried in August,\r\n1598, saw the Devil “tantost en forme de chat.” Rolande de Vernois\r\nacknowledged “Le Diable se presenta pour lors au Sabbat en forme d’vn\r\ngroz chat noir.”[69] To the goat there are innumerable allusions. In the\r\nBasses-Pyrénées (1609): “Le Diable estoit en forme de bouc ayant vne\r\nqueue & audessous vn visage d’homme noir.” (The Devil appeared in the\r\nform of a goat having a tail & his fundament was the face of a black\r\nman.) Iohannis d’Aguerre said that the Devil was “en forme de bouc.”[70]\r\n“Marie d’Aguerre said that there was in the midst of the ring an immense\r\npitcher whence the Devil issued in the form of a goat.” Gentien le Clerc,\r\nwho was tried at Orleans in 1614, “said that, as he was told, his mother\r\nwhen he was three years old presented him at the Sabbat to a goat whom\r\nthey saluted as l’Aspic.”[71] “Sur le trône,” writes Görres, “est assis\r\nun bouc, ou du moins la forme d’un bouc, car le démon ne peut cacher ce\r\nqu’il est.”[72]\r\n\r\nIn 1630 Elizabeth Stevenson, _alias_ Toppock, of Niddrie, avowed to\r\nher judges that in company with Catharine Oswald, who was tried for\r\nbeing by _habite and repute_ a witch, and Alexander Hamilton, “a known\r\nwarlock,” she went “to a den betwixt Niddrie and Edmiston, where the\r\ndevill had trysted hir, where he appeared first to them like a foall,\r\nand then like a man, and appointed a new dyet at Salcott Muire.” When\r\none of Catharine Oswald’s intimates, Alexander Hunter, _alias_ Hamilton,\r\n_alias_ Hattaraick, a “Warlok Cairle” who “abused the Countrey for a long\r\ntime,”[73] was apprehended at Dunbar he confessed that the Devil would\r\nmeet him riding upon a black horse, or in the shape of a _corbie_, a cat,\r\nor a dog. He was burned upon Castle Hill, Edinburgh, 1631.\r\n\r\nSometimes those who are present at the Sabbat are masked. Canon Ribet\r\nwrites: “Les visiteurs du sabbat se cachent quelquefois sous des\r\nformes bestiales, on se couvrent le visage d’un masque pour demeurer\r\ninconnus.”[74] (Those who attend the Sabbat sometimes disguise themselves\r\nas beasts, or cover their faces to conceal their identities.)\r\n\r\nAt the famous Sabbat of one hundred and forty witches in North Berwick\r\nchurchyard on All Hallow e’en, 1590, when they danced “endlong the\r\nKirk-yard” “John Fian, missellit [masked] led the ring.” The Salamanca\r\ndoctors mention the appearance at the Sabbats of persons “aut aperta,\r\naut linteo uelata facie,”[75] “with their faces sometimes bare,\r\nsometimes shrouded in a linen wimple.” And Delrio has in reference to\r\nthis precaution: “Facie interdum aperta, interdum uelata larua, linteo,\r\nuel alio uelamine aut persona.”[76] (Sometimes their faces are bare,\r\nsometimes hidden, either in a vizard, a linen cloth, or a veil, or a\r\nmask.)\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the eighteenth century the territory of Limburg was\r\nterrorized by a mysterious society known as “The Goats.” These wretches\r\nmet at night in a secret chapel, and after the most hideous orgies, which\r\nincluded the paying of divine honours to Satan and other foul blasphemies\r\nof the Sabbat, they donned masks fashioned to imitate goats’ heads,\r\ncloaked themselves with long disguise mantles, and sallied forth in bands\r\nto plunder and destroy. From 1772 to 1774 alone the tribunal of Foquemont\r\ncondemned four hundred Goats to the gallows. But the organization was not\r\nwholly exterminated until about the year 1780 after a regime of the most\r\nrepressive measures and unrelaxing vigilance.\r\n\r\nAmong certain tribes inhabiting the regions of the Congo there exists a\r\nsecret association of Egbo worshippers. Egbo or Ekpé is the evil genius\r\nor Satan. His rites are Obeeyahism, the adoration of Obi, or the Devil,\r\nand devil-worship is practised by many barbarous races, as, for instance,\r\nby the Coroados and the Tupayas, in the impenetrable forests between the\r\nrivers Prado and Doce in Brazil, by the Abipones of Paraguay, as well as\r\nby the Bachapins, a Caffre race, by the negroes on the Gold Coast and the\r\nnegroes of the West Indies. In the ju-ju houses of the Egbo sorcerers\r\nare obscene wooden statues to which great veneration is paid, since by\r\ntheir means divination is solemnly practised. Certain festivals are\r\nheld during the year, and at these it is interesting to note that the\r\nmembers wear hideous black masks with huge horns which it is death for\r\nthe uninitiated to see.\r\n\r\nThe first ceremony of the Sabbat was the worship of, and the paying\r\nhomage to the Devil. It would seem that sometimes this was preceded by\r\na roll-call of the evil devotees. Agnes Sampson confessed that at the\r\nmeeting in North Berwick, when the whole assembly had entered the church,\r\n“The _Devil_ started up himself in the _Pulpit_ like a mickle black man,\r\nand calling the Row, every one answered _Here_. _Mr. Robert Grierson_\r\nbeing named, they all ran _hirdie girdie_, and were angry: for it was\r\npromised he should be called _Robert_ the _Comptroller_, _alias Rob_\r\nthe _Rower_, for expriming of his name. The first thing he demanded was\r\nwhether they had been good servants, and what they had done since the\r\nlast time they had convened.”\r\n\r\nThe witches adored Satan, or the Master of the Sabbat who presided in\r\nplace of Satan, by prostrations, genuflections, gestures, and obeisances.\r\nIn mockery of solemn bows and seemly courtesies the worshippers of the\r\nDemon approach him awkwardly, with grotesque and obscene mops and mows,\r\nsometimes straddling sideways, sometimes walking backwards, as Guazzo\r\nsays: Cum accedunt ad dæmones eos ueneraturi terga obuertunt & cessim eum\r\ncancrorum more supplicaturi manus inuersas retro applicant.[77] But their\r\nchief act of homage was the reverential kiss, _osculum infame_. This\r\nimpious and lewd ritual is mentioned in detail by most authorities and\r\nis to be found in all lands and centuries. So Delrio writes: “The Sabbat\r\nis presided over by a Demon, the Lord of the Sabbat, who appears in some\r\nmonstrous form, most generally as a goat or some hound of hell, seated\r\nupon a haughty throne. The witches who resort to the Sabbat approach the\r\nthrone with their backs turned, and worship him ... and then, as a sign\r\nof their homage, they kiss his fundament.” Guazzo notes: “As a sign of\r\nhomage witches kiss the Devil’s fundament.” And Ludwig Elich says: “Then\r\nas a token of their homage—with reverence be it spoken—they kiss the\r\nfundament of the Devil.”[78] “Y al tiempo que le besan debajo de la cola,\r\nda una ventosidad de muy horrible olor,” adds the Spanish _Relacion_,\r\n“fetid, foul, and filthy.”\r\n\r\nTo cite other authorities would be but to quote the same words. Thomas\r\nCooper, indeed, seems to regard this ceremony as a part of the rite\r\nof admission, but to confine it to this occasion alone is manifestly\r\nincorrect, for there is continual record of its observance at frequent\r\nSabbats by witches of many years standing. “Secondly,” he remarks, “when\r\nthis acknowledgement is made, in testimoniall of this subiection, Satan\r\noffers his back-parts to be kissed of his vassall.”[79] But in the dittay\r\nof the North Berwick witches, all of whom had long been notorious for\r\ntheir malpractices, “_Item_, the said Agnis Sampson confessed that the\r\ndivell being then at North Barrick Kerke, attending their comming, in the\r\nhabit or likenesse of a man,[80] and seeing that they tarried over long,\r\nhee at their comming enjoyned them all to a pennance, which was, that\r\nthey should kisse his buttockes, in sign of duety to him, which being put\r\nover the pulpit bare, every one did as he had enjoyned them.”[81]\r\n\r\nOne of the principal charges which was repeatedly brought against\r\nthe Knights Templars during the lengthy ecclesiastical and judicial\r\nprocesses, 1307-1314, was that of the _osculum infame_ given by the\r\njuniors to their preceptors. Even so prejudiced a writer as Lea cannot\r\nbut admit the truth of this accusation. In this case, however, it has\r\nnothing to do with sorcery but must be connected with the homosexuality\r\nwhich the Order universally practised.\r\n\r\nThere are some very important details rehearsed in a Bull, 8 June,\r\n1303, of the noble but calumniated Boniface VIII, with reference to the\r\ncase of Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry (1296-1322),\r\nand treasurer of Edward I, when this prelate was accused of sorcery\r\nand homage to Satan: “For some time past it has come to our ears that\r\nour Venerable Brother Walter Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield has\r\nbeen commonly defamed, and accused, both in the realm of England and\r\nelsewhere, of paying homage to the Devil by kissing his posterior, and\r\nthat he hath had frequent colloquies with evil spirits.”[82] The Bishop\r\ncleared himself of these charges with the compurgators. Bodin refers to\r\nGuillaume Edeline, who was executed in 1453 as a wizard. He was a doctor\r\nof the Sorbonne, and prior of St. Germain en Laye: “The aforesaid sire\r\nGuillaume confessed ... that he had done homage to the aforesaid Satan,\r\nwho appeared in the shape of a ram, by kissing his buttocks in token of\r\nreverence and homage.”[83] A very rare tract of the fourteenth century\r\ndirected against the Waldenses among other charges brings the following:\r\n“Item, in aliquibus aliis partibus apparet eis dæmon sub specie et figura\r\ncati, quem sub cauda sigillatim osculantur.” (The Devil appears to them\r\nas a cat, and they kiss him _sub cauda_.)[84]\r\n\r\nBarthélemy Minguet of Brécy, a young man of twenty-five, who was tried\r\nin 1616, said that at the Sabbat “he often saw [the Devil] in the shape\r\nof a man, who held a horse by its bridle, & that they went forward to\r\nworship him, each one holding a pitch candle of black wax in their\r\nhands.”[85] These candles, as Guazzo tells us, were symbolic and required\r\nby the ritual of the Sabbat, not merely of use for the purpose of giving\r\nlight: “Then they made an offering of pitch black candles, and as a\r\nsign of homage kissed his fundament.”[86] The candles were ordinarily\r\nblack, and one taper, larger than the rest, was frequently carried by the\r\nDevil himself. At the North Berwick meeting when the witches were all to\r\nassemble in the church, “_Iohn Fein_ blew up the Kirk doors, and blew in\r\nthe lights, which wer like _Mickl black candles sticking round about the\r\nPulpit_.”[87] Boguet relates that the witches whom he tried confessed\r\nthat the Sabbat commenced with the adoration of Satan, “who appeared,\r\nsometimes in the shape of a tall dark man, sometimes in the shape of a\r\ngoat, & to express their worship and homage, they made him an offering\r\nof candles, which burned with a blue light.”[88] John Fian, also, when\r\ndoing homage to the Devil “thought he saw the light of a candle ... which\r\nappeared blue lowe.” This, of course, was on account of the sulphurous\r\nmaterial whence these candles were specially compounded. De Lancre\r\nexpressly states that the candles or flambeaux used at the Sabbat were\r\nmade of pitch.\r\n\r\nAn important feature of the greater Sabbats was the ritual dance, for the\r\ndance was an act of devotion which has descended to us from the earliest\r\ntimes and is to be found in every age and every country. Dancing is a\r\nnatural movement, a primitive expression of emotion and ideals. In the\r\nancient world there can have been few things fairer than that rhythmic\r\nthanksgiving of supple limbs and sweet voices which Athens loved, and\r\nfor many a century was preserved the memory of that day when the young\r\nSophocles led the choir in celebration of the victory of Salamis.[89]\r\nThe Mystæ in the meadows of Elysium danced their rounds with the silver\r\nclash of cymbals and with madly twinkling snow-white feet. At the solemn\r\nprocession of the Ark from Cariathiarim (Kirjath Jearim) King David\r\n“danced with all his might before the Lord, ... dancing and leaping\r\nbefore the Lord.” S. Basil urges his disciples to dance on earth in order\r\nto fit themselves for what may be one of the occupations of the angels\r\nin heaven. As late as the seventeenth century the ceremonial dance in\r\nchurch was not uncommon. In 1683 it was the duty of the senior canon to\r\nlead a dance of choir-boys in the Paris cathedral. Among the Abyssinian\r\nChristians dancing forms no inconsiderable part of worship. Year by\r\nyear on Whit Tuesday hundreds of pilgrims dance through the streets\r\nof Echternach (Luxemburg) to the shrine of S. Willibrod in S. Peter’s\r\nChurch. Formerly the devotees danced three times round the great Abbey\r\nCourtyard before proceeding to the sanctuary. But beyond all these the\r\ndance has its own place in the ritual of Holy Church even yet. Three\r\ntimes a year in Seville Cathedral—on Holy Thursday, upon Corpus Christi\r\nand the Immaculate Conception—Los Seises dance before a specially\r\nconstructed altar, exquisitely adorned with flowers and lights, erected\r\nnear the outer door of the grand western entrance of the cathedral. The\r\nceremony in all probability dates from the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe dresses of the boys, who dance before the improvised altar at\r\nBenediction on Corpus Christi, are of the period of Philip III, and\r\nconsist of short trousers and jackets that hang from one shoulder, the\r\ndoublets being of red satin, with rich embroidery. Plumed white hats with\r\nfeathers are worn, also shoes with large scintillating buckles. On Holy\r\nThursday the costume is also red and white, whilst it is blue and white\r\nfor “the day of the Virgin.”\r\n\r\nThe eight boy choristers—with eight others as attendants—dance, with\r\ncastanets in their hands, to a soft organ obbligato, down the centre of\r\nthe cathedral to the decorated altar, advancing slowly and gracefully.\r\nHere they remain for about a quarter of an hour, singing a hymn, and\r\naccompanying it (as the carols of the olden time) with dance and\r\ncastanets. They sing a two-part hymn in front of the altar, forming in\r\ntwo eights, facing each other, the clergy kneeling in a semicircle round\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAssuredly I cannot do better than quote Mr. Arthur Symons’ verdict on\r\nthis dance as he saw it a few years back in Seville: “And, yes, I found\r\nit perfectly dignified, perfectly religious, without a suspicion of\r\nlevity or indecorum. This consecration of the dance, this turning of a\r\npossible vice into a means of devotion, this bringing of the people’s\r\nart, the people’s passion, which in Seville is dancing, into the church,\r\nfinding it a place there, is precisely one of those acts of divine\r\nworldly wisdom which the Church has so often practised in her conquest of\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\nNot too fantastically has a writer suggested that High Mass itself in\r\nsome sense enshrines a survival of the ancient religious dance—that\r\nstately, magnificent series of slow movements which surely may express\r\ndevotion of the most solemn and reverent kind, as well as can the colour\r\nof vestment or sanctuary, or the sounds of melody.\r\n\r\nSince the dance is so essentially religious it must needs be burlesqued\r\nand buffooned by God’s ape. For the dance of the witches is degraded,\r\nawkward, foul, and unclean. These very movements are withershins, as\r\nGuazzo points out: “Then follow the round dances in which, however, they\r\nalways tread the measure to the left.”[90] “The Sorcerers,” says Boguet,\r\n“dance a country-dance with their backs turned one to the other.”[91]\r\nThis, of course, being the exact reverse of the natural country-dance.\r\n“Sometimes, although seldom,” he adds, “they dance in couples, &\r\nsometimes one partner is there, another here, for always everything is\r\nin confusion.”[92] De Lancre writes of witches’ revels: “They only dance\r\nthree kinds of brawls.... The first is _à la Bohémienne_ ... the second\r\nwith quick trippings: these are round dances.”[93] In the third Sabbat\r\nmeasure the dancers were placed one behind another in a straight line.\r\n\r\nAn old Basque legend reported by Estefanella Hirigaray describes how the\r\nwitches were wont to meet near an old limekiln to dance their rounds, a\r\nceremony regarded throughout that district as an essential feature of\r\nthe Sabbat. De Lancre notes the brawls _à la Bohémienne_ as especially\r\nfavoured by sorcerers in Labourd. Sylvester Mazzolini, O.P. (1460-1523),\r\nMaster of the Sacred Palace, and the great champion of orthodoxy\r\nagainst the heresiarch Luther, in his erudite _De Strigimagia_[94]\r\nrelates that in Como and Brescia a number of children between eight and\r\ntwelve years old, who had frequented the Sabbat, but had been happily\r\nconverted by the unsparing patience of the Inquisitors, at the request\r\nof the Superiors gave exhibitions of these dances when they showed such\r\nextraordinary adroitness and skill in executing the most intricate\r\nand fantastic figures that it was evident they had been instructed\r\nby no mere human tutelage. Marco de Viqueria, the Dominican Prior of\r\nthe Brussels monastery, closely investigated the matter, and he was a\r\nreligious of such known acumen and exceptional probity that his testimony\r\nsoon convinced many prelates at Rome who were inclined to suspect some\r\ntrickery or cunning practice. In Belgium this Sabbat dance was known as\r\n_Pauana_.\r\n\r\nIn the Fian trial Agnes Sampson confessed that “They danced along the\r\n_Kirk-yeard_, _Geilic Duncan_ playing on a _Trump_, and _John Fein_\r\nmussiled led the _Ring_. The said _Agnes_ and her daughter followed next.\r\nBesides these were _Kate Gray_, _George Noilis_ his wife, ... with the\r\nrest of their Cummers above an hundred Persons.”[95] She further added\r\n“that this Geillis Duncane did goe before them, playing this reill or\r\ndaunce uppon a small trumpe, called a Jewe’s trumpe, untill they entered\r\ninto the Kerk of North Barrick.”[96] “These confessions made the King\r\n[James I, then James VI of Scotland] in a wonderfull admiration, and sent\r\nfor the saide Geillis Duncane, who, upon the like trumpe, did play the\r\nsaide daunce before the kinges maiestie.”\r\n\r\nMusic generally accompanied the dancers, and there is ample evidence that\r\nvarious instruments were played, violins, flutes, tambourines, citterns,\r\nhautboys, and, in Scotland, the pipes. Those of the witches who had\r\nany skill were the performers, and very often they obliged the company\r\nawhile with favourite airs of a vulgar kind, but the concert ended in\r\nthe most hideous discords and bestial clamour; the laws of harmony\r\nand of decency were alike rudely violated. In August, 1590, a certain\r\nNicolas Laghernhard, on his way to Assencauria, was passing through the\r\noutskirts of a wood when he saw through the trees a number of men and\r\nwomen dancing with filthy and fantastic movements. In amaze he signed\r\nhimself and uttered the Holy Name, whereupon the company perceiving him\r\ntook to flight, but not before he had recognized many of these wretches.\r\nHe was prompt to inform the ecclesiastical tribunals, and several persons\r\nbeing forthwith questioned freely acknowledged their infamies. Amongst\r\nthese a shepherd named Michael, who enjoyed a considerable reputation for\r\nhis musical talents and strangely fascinating voice, confessed that he\r\nwas the piper at the local Sabbat and that his services were in constant\r\nrequisition. At the lesser Sabbats (_aquelarre_) of Zugarramurdi, a\r\nhamlet of Navarre, some six hundred souls, in the Bastan valley, some\r\ntwelve leagues from Pampluna, one Juan de Goyburu was wont to play upon\r\nthe flute, and Juan de Sansin the tambourine. These two unhappy wretches,\r\nhaving shown every sign of sincerest contrition, were reconciled to the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nSinclar in his Relation XXXV, “Anent some Prayers, Charms, and Avies,\r\nused in the _Highlands_,” says: “As the Devil is originally the Author\r\nof _Charms_, and _Spells_, so is he the Author of several baudy Songs,\r\nwhich are sung. A reverend Minister told me, that one who was the Devils\r\nPiper, a wizzard confest to him, that at a Ball of dancing, the Foul\r\nSpirit taught him a Baudy song to sing and play, as it were this night,\r\nand ere two days past all the Lads and Lasses of the town were lilting\r\nit throw the street. It were abomination to rehearse it.” Philip Ludwig\r\nElich precisely sums up the confused scene: “The whole foul mob and\r\nstinkard rabble sing the most obscene priapics and abominable songs in\r\nhonour of the Devil. One witch yells, _Harr, harr_; a second hag, Devil,\r\nDevil; jump hither, jump thither; a third, Gambol hither, gambol thither;\r\nanother, _Sabaoth, Sabaoth_, &c.; and so the wild orgy waxes frantic what\r\ntime the bedlam rout are screeching, hissing, howling, caterwauling, and\r\nwhooping lewd wassail.”[97] Of all the horrors of the Sabbat the climax\r\nwas that appalling blasphemy and abominable impiety by which the most\r\nHoly Sacrifice of the Altar was mocked and burlesqued in hideous fashion.\r\nAnd since no Christian will receive the Blessed Sacrament save he be duly\r\nfasting as the Church so strictly enjoins, the witches in derision of\r\nChrist’s ordinance satiate their appetites with a wolfish feast and cram\r\nthemselves to excess with food of all kinds, both meat and drink, before\r\nthey proceed to the ritual of hell. These orgies were often prolonged\r\namid circumstances of the most beastly gluttony and drunkenness.\r\n\r\nGuazzo writes: “Tables are laid and duly furnished, whereupon they set\r\nthemselves to the board & begin to gobbet piecemeal the meats which the\r\nDevil provides, or which each member of the party severally brings with\r\nhim.”[98] De Lancre also says: “Many authors say that sorcerers at the\r\nSabbat eat the food which the Devil lays before them: but very often\r\nthe table is only dressed with the viands they themselves bring along.\r\nSometimes there are certain tables served with rare dainties, at others\r\nwith orts and offal.” “Their banquets are of various kinds of food\r\naccording to the district & the quality of those who are to partake.”[99]\r\nIt seems plain that when the local head of the witches, who often\r\npresided at these gatherings _absente diabolo_, was a person of wealth or\r\nstanding, delicacies and choice wines would make their appearance at the\r\nfeast, but when it was the case of the officer of a coven in some poor\r\nand small district, possibly a meeting of peasants, the homeliest fare\r\nonly might be served. The Lancashire witches of 1613, when they met at\r\nMalking Tower, sat down to a goodly spread of “Beefe, Bacon, and roasted\r\nMutton,” the sheep having been killed twenty-four hours earlier by James\r\nDevice; in 1633 Edmund Robinson stated that the Pendle witches offered\r\nhim “flesh and bread upon a trencher, and drink in a glass,” they also\r\nhad “flesh smoaking, butter in lumps, and milk,” truly rustic dainties.\r\nAlice Duke, a Somerset witch, tried in 1664, confessed that the Devil\r\n“bids them _Welcome_ at their _Coming_, and brings them _Wine_, _Beer_,\r\n_Cakes_, and _Meal_, or the like.”[100] At the trial of Louis Gaufridi\r\nat Aix in 1610 the following description of a Sabbat banquet was given:\r\n“Then they feasted, three tables being set out according to the three\r\naforesaid degrees. Those who were employed in serving bread had loaves\r\nmade from wheat privily stolen in various places. They drank malmsey\r\nin order to excite them to venery. Those who acted as cup-bearers had\r\nfilched the wine from cellars where it was stored. Sometimes they ate the\r\ntender flesh of little children, who had been slain and roasted at some\r\nSynagogue, and sometimes babes were brought there, yet alive, whom the\r\nwitches had kidnapped from their homes if opportunity offered.”[101] In\r\nmany places the witches were not lucky enough to get bumpers of malmsey,\r\nfor Boguet notes that at some Sabbats “They not unseldom drink wine but\r\nmore often water.”[102]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V\r\n\r\nTHE SABBAT. Ziarnko\r\n\r\n[_face p. 144_]\r\n\r\nThere are occasional records of unsavoury and tasteless viands, and there\r\nis even mention of putrefying garbage and carrion being placed before his\r\nevil worshippers by their Master. Such would appear to have been the case\r\nat those darker orgies when there was a manifestation of supernatural\r\nintelligences from the pit.\r\n\r\nThe Salamanca doctors say: “They make a meal from food either furnished\r\nby themselves or by the Devil. It is sometimes most delicious and\r\ndelicate, and sometimes a pie baked from babies they have slain or\r\ndisinterred corpses. A suitable grace is said before such a table.”[103]\r\nGuazzo thus describes their wine: “Moreover the wine which is usually\r\npoured out for the revellers is like black and clotted blood served in\r\nsome foul and filthy vessel. Yet there seems to be no lack of cheer at\r\nthese banquets, save that they furnish neither bread nor salt. Isabella\r\nfurther added that human flesh was served.”[104]\r\n\r\nSalt never appeared at the witches’ table. Bodin gives us the reason that\r\nit is an emblem of eternity,[105] and Philip Ludwig Elich emphatically\r\ndraws attention to the absence of salt at these infernal banquets.[106]\r\n“At these meals,” remarks Boguet, “salt never appears.”[107] Gentien le\r\nClerc, who was tried in Orleans in 1615, confessed: “They sit down to\r\ntable, but no salt is ever seen.”[108] Madeleine de la Palud declared\r\nthat she had never seen salt, olives, or oil at the Devil’s feasts.[109]\r\n\r\nWhen all these wretches are replete they proceed to a solemn parody of\r\nHoly Mass.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century Marcelline Pauper of the\r\nCongregation of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers was divinely called\r\nto offer herself up as a victim of reparation for the outrages done to\r\nthe Blessed Sacrament, especially by sorcerers in their black masses at\r\nthe Sabbat. In March, 1702, a frightful sacrilege was committed in the\r\nconvent chapel. The tabernacle was forced open, the ciborium stolen, and\r\nthose of the Hosts which had not been carried away by the Satanists were\r\nthrown to the pavement and trampled under foot. Marcelline made ceaseless\r\nreparation, and at nine o’clock of the evening of 26 April, she received\r\nthe stigmata in hands, feet, and side, and also the Crown of Thorns.\r\nAfter a few years of expiation she died at Tulle, 25 June, 1708.\r\n\r\nThe erudite Paul Grilland tells us that the liturgy is burlesqued in\r\nevery detail: “Those witches who have solemnly devoted themselves to\r\nthe Devil’s service, worship him in a particular manner with ceremonial\r\nsacrifices, which they offer to the Devil, imitating in all respects the\r\nworship of Almighty God, with vestments, lights, and every other ritual\r\nobservance, and with a set liturgy in which they are instructed, so\r\nthat they worship and praise him eternally, just as we worship the true\r\nGod.”[110] This abomination of blasphemy is met with again and again in\r\nthe confessions of witches, and although particulars may differ here\r\nand there, the same quintessence of sacrilege persisted throughout the\r\ncenturies, even as alas! in hidden corners and secret lairs of infamy it\r\nskulks and lurks this very day.\r\n\r\nWhat appears extremely surprising in this connexion is the statement of\r\nCotton Mather that the New England witches “met in Hellish _Randezvous_,\r\nwherein the Confessors (i.e. the accused who confessed) do say, they have\r\nhad their Diabolical Sacraments, imitating the _Baptism_ and the _Supper_\r\nof our Lord.”[111] At the trial of Bridget Bishop, _alias_ Oliver, at\r\nthe Court of Oyer and Terminer, held at Salem, 2 June, 1692, Deliverance\r\nHobbs, a converted witch, affirmed “that this _Bishop_ was at a General\r\nMeeting of the Witches, in a Field at _Salem_-Village, and there partook\r\nof a Diabolical Sacrament in Bread and Wine then administered.” In the\r\ncase of Martha Carrier, tried 2 August, 1692, before the same court,\r\ntwo witnesses swore they had seen her “at a Diabolical Sacrament ...\r\nwhen they had Bread and Wine Administered unto them.” Abigail Williams\r\nconfessed that on 31 March, 1692, when there was a Public Fast observed\r\nin Salem on account of the scourge of sorcery “the Witches had a\r\n_Sacrament_ that day at an house in the Village, and that they had\r\n_Red Bread_ and _Red Drink_.” This “Red Bread” is certainly puzzling.\r\nBut the whole thing, sufficiently profane no doubt, necessarily lacks\r\nthe hideous impiety of the black mass. A minister, the Rev. George\r\nBurroughs, is pointed to by accumulated evidence as being the Chief of\r\nthe Salem witches; “he was Accused by Eight of the Confessing Witches as\r\nbeing an Head Actor at some of their Hellish Randezvouses, and one who\r\nhad the promise of being a King in Satan’s kingdom”; it was certainly he\r\nwho officiated at their ceremonies, for amongst others Richard Carrier\r\n“affirmed to the jury that he saw Mr. George Burroughs at the witch\r\nmeeting at the village and saw him administer the sacrament,” whilst Mary\r\nLacy, senr., and her daughter Mary “affirmed that Mr. George Burroughs\r\nwas at the witch meetings with witch sacraments.”[112]\r\n\r\nThe abomination of the black mass is performed by some apostate or\r\nrenegade priest who has delivered himself over to the service of evil and\r\nis shamefully prominent amongst the congregation of witches. It should be\r\nremarked from this fact that it is plain the witches are as profoundly\r\nconvinced of the doctrines of Transubstantiation, the Totality,\r\nPermanence, and Adorableness of the Eucharistic Christ, and of the power\r\nalso of the sacrificing priesthood, as is the most orthodox Catholic.\r\nIndeed, unless such were the case, their revolt would be empty, void at\r\nany rate of its material malice.\r\n\r\nOne of the gravest charges brought against the Templars and in the\r\ntrials (1307-1314) established beyond any question or doubt was that of\r\ncelebrating a blasphemous mass in which the words of consecration were\r\nomitted. It has, indeed, been suggested that the liturgy used by the\r\nTemplars was not the ordinary Western Rite, but that it was an Eastern\r\nEucharist. According to Catholic teaching the Consecration takes place\r\nwhen the words of institution are recited with intention and appropriate\r\ngesture, the actual change of the entire substances of bread and wine\r\ninto the Body and Blood of Christ being effected in virtue of the words\r\n_Hoc est enim Corpus meum; Hic est enim Calix sanguinis mei_.... This\r\nhas been defined by a decree of the Council of Florence (1439): “Quod\r\nilia uerba diuina Saluatoris omnem uirtutem transsubstantiationis\r\nhabent.” (These divine words of Our Saviour have full power to effect\r\ntransubstantiation.) But the Orthodox Church holds that an Epiklesis is\r\nnecessary to valid consecration, the actual words of Our Lord being\r\nrepeated “as a narrative” [διηγηματικῶς],[113] which would seem logically\r\nto imply that Christ’s words have no part in the form of the Sacrament.\r\nIn all Orthodox liturgies the words of Consecration are found together\r\nwith the Epiklesis, and there are in existence some few liturgies,\r\nplainly invalid, which omit the words of Consecration altogether. These\r\nare all of them forms which have been employed by heretical sects; and it\r\nmay be that the Templars used one of these. But it is far more probable\r\nthat the words were purposely omitted; the Templars were corroded with\r\nGnostic doctrines, they held the heresies of the Mandæans or Johannites\r\nwho were filled with an insane hatred of Christ in much the same way\r\nas witches and demonolaters, they followed the tenets of the Ophites\r\nwho venerated the Serpent and prayed to him for protection against the\r\nCreator, they adored and offered sacrifice before an idol, a Head, which,\r\nas Professor Prutz holds, represented the lower god whom Gnostic bodies\r\nworshipped, that is Satan. At his trial in Tuscany the knight Bernard of\r\nParma confessed that the Order firmly believed this idol had the power\r\nto save and to enrich, in fine, flat diabolism. The secret mass of the\r\nTemplars may have burlesqued an Eastern liturgy rather than the Western\r\nrite, but none the less it was the essential cult of the evil principle.\r\n\r\nIn 1336 a priest who had been imprisoned by the Comte de Foix, Gaston III\r\nPhébus, on a charge of celebrating a Satanic mass, was sent to Avignon\r\nand examined by Benedict XII in person. The next year the same pontiff\r\nappointed his trusty Guillaume Lombard to preside at the trial of Pierre\r\ndu Chesne, a priest from the diocese of Tarbes, accused of defiling the\r\nHost.\r\n\r\nGilles de Sillé, a priest of the diocese of S. Malo, and the Florentine\r\nAntonio Francesco Prelati, formerly of the diocese of Arezzo, were wont\r\nto officiate at the black masses of Tiffauges and Machecoul, the castles\r\nof Gilles de Rais, who was executed in 1440.\r\n\r\nA priest named Benedictus in the sixteenth century caused great scandal\r\nby the discovery of his assistance at secret and unhallowed rites.\r\nCharles IX employed an apostate monk to celebrate the eucharist of\r\nhell before himself and his intimates, and during the reign of his\r\nbrother the Bishop of Paris burned in the Place de Grève a friar named\r\nSéchelle who had been found guilty of participating in similar profane\r\nmysteries. In 1597 the Parliament of Paris sentenced Jean Belon, curé of\r\nS. Pierre-des-Lampes in the Bourges diocese, to be hanged and his body\r\nburned for desecration of the Sacrament and the repeated celebration\r\nof abominable ceremonies.[114] The Parliament of Bordeaux in 1598\r\ncondemned to the stake Pierre Aupetit, curé of Pageas, near Chalus\r\nLimousin. He confessed that for more than twenty years he had frequented\r\nSabbats, especially those held at Mathe-goutte and Puy-de-Dôme, where he\r\nworshipped the Devil and performed impious masses in his honour.[115]\r\nAugust 14, 1606, a friar named Denobilibus was put to death at Grenoble\r\nupon a similar conviction. In 1609 the Parliament of Bordeaux sent Pierre\r\nDe Lancre and d’Espagnet to Labourd in the Bayonne district to stamp\r\nout the sorcerers who infested that region. No less than seven priests\r\nwere arrested on charges of celebrating Satan’s mass at the Sabbat. Two,\r\nMigalena, an old man of seventy, and Pierre Bocal, aged twenty-seven,\r\nwere executed, but the Bishop of Bayonne interfered, claimed the five\r\nfor his own tribunal and contrived that they should escape from prison.\r\nThree other priests who were under restraint were immediately set free,\r\nand wisely quitted the country. A twelvemonth later Aix and the whole\r\ncountryside rang with the confessions of Madeleine de la Palud who “Dit\r\naussi que ce malheureux Loys magicien ... a controuvé le premier de dire\r\nla messe au sabatt et consacrer Véritablement et présenter le sacrifice à\r\nLucifer.”[116] It was, of course, mere ignorance on her part to suppose\r\nthat “that accursed Magician Lewes did first inuent the saying of Masse\r\nat the Sabbaths,” although Gaufridi may have told her this to impress\r\nher with a sense of his importance and power among the hierarchies of\r\nevil. Certainly in her evidence the details of the Sabbat worship are\r\nexceptionally detailed and complete.\r\n\r\nThey are, however, amply paralleled, if not exceeded, by the narrative\r\nof Madeleine Bavent, a Franciscan sister of the Third Order, attached\r\nto the convent of SS. Louis and Elizabeth at Louviers. Her confessions,\r\nwhich she wrote at length by the direction of her confessor, des Marets,\r\nan Oratorian, meticulously describe scenes of the most hideous blasphemy\r\nin which were involved three chaplains, David, Maturin Picard, the curé\r\nof Mesnil-Jourdain, and Thomas Boullé, sometime his assistant. Amongst\r\nother enormities they had revived the heresy of the Adamites, an early\r\nGnostic sect, and celebrated the Mass in a state of stark nudity amid\r\ncircumstances of the grossest indecency. Upon one Good Friday Picard\r\nand Boullé had compelled her to defile the crucifix and to break a\r\nconsecrated Host, throwing the fragments upon the ground and trampling\r\nthem. David and Picard were dead, but Boullé was burned at Rouen, 21\r\nAugust, 1647.[117]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Louis XIV a veritable epidemic of sacrilege seemed\r\nto rage throughout Paris.[118] The horrors of the black mass were said\r\nin many houses, especially in that of La Voisin (Catherine Deshayes)\r\nwho lived in the rue Beauregard. The leading spirit of this crew was\r\nthe infamous abbé Guibourg, a bastard son—so gossip said—of Henri de\r\nMontmorency. With him were joined Brigallier, almoner of the Grande\r\nMademoiselle; Bouchot, director of the convent of La Saussaye; Dulong, a\r\ncanon of Notre-Dame; Dulausens, vicar of Saint-Leu; Dubousquet; Seysson;\r\nDussis; Lempérier; Lépreux; Davot, vicar of Notre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle;\r\nMariette, vicar of Saint-Séverin, skilled in maledictions; Lemeignan,\r\nvicar of Saint-Eustache, who was convicted of having sacrificed\r\nnumberless children to Satan; Toumet; Le Franc; Cotton, vicar of St.\r\nPaul, who had baptized a baby with the chrism of Extreme Unction and then\r\nthrottled him upon the altar; Guignard and Sébault of the diocese of\r\nBourges, who officiated at the black mass in the cellars of a house at\r\nParis, and confected filthy charms under conditions of the most fearful\r\nimpiety.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century the black mass persisted. In 1723 the police\r\narrested the abbé Lecollet and the abbé Bournement for this profanity;\r\nand in 1745 the abbé de Rocheblanche fell under the same suspicion. At\r\nthe hotel of Madame de Charolais the vilest scenes of the Sabbat were\r\ncontinued. A gang of Satanists celebrated their monstrous orgies at\r\nParis on 22 January, 1793, the night after the murder of Louis XVI. The\r\nabbé Fiard in two of his works, _Lettres sur le diable_, 1791, and _La\r\nFrance Trompée_ ... Paris, 8vo, 1803, conclusively shows that eucharistic\r\nblasphemies were yet being perpetrated but in circumstances of almost\r\nimpenetrable secrecy. In 1865 a scandal connected with these abominations\r\ncame to light, and the Bishop of Sens, in whose diocese it occurred, was\r\nso horrified that he resigned his office and retired to Fontainebleau,\r\nwhere he died some eighteen months later, practically of shock. Similar\r\npractices were unmasked at Paris in 1874 and again in 1878, whilst it is\r\ncommon knowledge that the characters of Joris Karl Huysmans’ _Là-Bas_\r\nwere all persons easy of identification, and the details are scenes\r\nexactly reproduced from contemporary life.[119] The hideous cult of evil\r\nyet endures. Satanists yet celebrate the black mass in London, Brighton,\r\nParis, Lyons, Bruges, Berlin, Milan, and alas! in Rome itself. Both South\r\nAmerica and Canada are thus polluted. In many a town, both great and\r\nsmall, they have their dens of blasphemy and evil where they congregate\r\nunsuspected to perform these execrable rites. Often they seem to\r\nconcentrate their vile energies in the quiet cathedral cities of England,\r\nFrance, Italy, in vain endeavour to disturb the ancient homes of peace\r\nwith the foul brabble of devil-worship and all ill.\r\n\r\nThey have even been brought upon the public stage. One episode of _Un\r\nSoir de Folie_, the revue (1925-6) at the Folies Bergère, Paris, was\r\n“Le Sabbat et la Herse Infernale,” where in a Gothic cathedral an actor\r\n(Mons. Benglia) appeared as Satan receiving the adoration of his devotees.\r\n\r\nAt the more frequented Sabbats the ritual of Holy Mass was elaborately\r\nburlesqued in almost every detail. An altar was erected with four\r\nsupports, sometimes under a sheltering tree, at others upon a flat rock,\r\nor some naturally convenient place, “auprès d’vn arbre, ou parfois auprès\r\nd’vn rocher, dressant quelque forme d’autel sur des colonés infernales,”\r\nsays De Lancre.[120] In more recent times and to-day when the black mass\r\nis celebrated in houses such an altar is often permanent and therefore\r\nthe infernal sanctuary can be builded with a display of the full\r\nsymbolism of the hideous cult of evil. The altar was covered with the\r\nthree linen cloths the ritual enjoins, and upon it were six black candles\r\nin the midst of which they placed a crucifix inverted, or an image of\r\nthe Devil. Sometimes the Devil himself occupied this central position,\r\nstanding erect, or seated on some kind of monstrous throne. In 1598,\r\nat a celebrated witch-trial before the Parliament of Bordeaux with the\r\nVicar-general of the Bishop of Limoges and a learned councillor Peyrat\r\nas assessors, Antoine Dumons of Saint-Laurent confessed that he had\r\nfrequently provided a large number of candles for the Sabbat, both wax\r\nlights to be distributed among those present and the large black tapers\r\nfor the altar. These were lit by Pierre Aupetit, who held a sacristan’s\r\nreed, and apparently officiated as Master of the Ceremonies when he was\r\nnot actually himself saying the Mass.[121]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1895, when the legal representatives of the Borghese family\r\nvisited the Palazzo Borghese, which had been rented for some time in\r\nseparate floors or suites, they found some difficulty in obtaining\r\nadmission to certain apartments on the first floor, the occupant of\r\nwhich seemed unaware that the lease was about to expire. By virtue of\r\nthe terms of the agreement, however, he was obliged to allow them to\r\ninspect the premises to see if any structural repairs or alterations were\r\nnecessary, as Prince Scipione Borghese, who was about to be married,\r\nintended immediately to take up his residence in the ancestral home with\r\nhis bride. One door the tenant obstinately refused to unlock, and when\r\npressed he betrayed the greatest confusion. The agents finally pointed\r\nout that they were within their rights to employ actual force, and that\r\nif access was longer denied they would not hesitate to do so forthwith.\r\nWhen the keys had been produced, the cause of the reluctance was soon\r\nplain. The room within was inscribed with the words _Templum Palladicum_.\r\nThe walls were hung all round from ceiling to floor with heavy curtains\r\nof silk damask, scarlet and black, excluding the light; at the further\r\nend there stretched a large tapestry upon which was woven in more than\r\nlife-size a figure of Lucifer, colossal, triumphant, dominating the\r\nwhole. Exactly beneath an altar had been built, amply furnished for the\r\nliturgy of hell: candles, vessels, rituals, missal, nothing was lacking.\r\nCushioned prie-dieus and luxurious chairs, crimson and gold, were set\r\nin order for the assistants; the chamber being lit by electricity,\r\nfantastically arrayed so as to glare from an enormous human eye. The\r\nvisitors soon quitted the accursed spot, the scene of devil-worship\r\nand blasphemy, nor had they any desire more nearly to examine the\r\nappointments of this infernal chapel.[122]\r\n\r\nThe missal used at the black mass was obviously a manuscript, although\r\nit is said that in later times these grimoires of hideous profanity have\r\nactually been printed. It is not infrequently mentioned. Thus De Lancre\r\nnotes that the sorcerers of the Basses-Pyrénées (1609) at their worship\r\nsaw the officiant “tournant les feuillets d’vn certain liure qu’il a en\r\nmain.”[123] Madeleine Bavent in her confession said: “On lisait la messe\r\ndans le livre des blasphèmes, qui servait de canon et qu’on employait\r\naussi dans les processions.”[124] The witches’ missal was often bound in\r\nhuman skin, generally that of an unbaptized babe.[125] Gentien le Clerc,\r\ntried at Orleans, 1614-1615, confessed that “le Diable ... marmote dans\r\nun liure duquel la couuerture est toute veluë comme d’vne peau de loup,\r\nauec des feuillets blancs & rouges, d’autres noires.”\r\n\r\nThe vestments worn by the celebrant are variously described. On rare\r\noccasions he is described as being arrayed in a bishop’s pontificalia,\r\nblack in hue, torn, squalid, and fusty. Boguet reports that a witch\r\nstated: “Celuy, qui est commis à faire l’office, est reuestu d’vne chappe\r\nnoire sans croix,”[126] but it seems somewhat strange that merely a plain\r\nblack cope should be used, unless the explanation is to be found in the\r\nfact that such a vestment was most easily procurable and no suspicion of\r\nits ultimate employment would be excited. The abbé Guibourg sometimes\r\nwore a cope of white silk embroidered with fir-cones, which again seems\r\nremarkable, as the symbolism is in no way connected with the Satanic\r\nrites he performed. But this is the evidence of Marguerite, La Voisin’s\r\ndaughter, who was not likely to be mistaken.[127] It is true that the\r\nmass was often, perhaps, partially erotic and not wholly diabolic in the\r\nsame sense as the Sabbat masses were, but yet Astaroth, Asmodeus, and\r\nLucifer were invoked, and it was a liturgy of evil. On other occasions\r\nGuibourg seems to have donned the orthodox eucharistic chasuble, stole,\r\nmaniple, girdle, alb, and amice. In the thirty-seventh article of his\r\nconfession Gaufridi acknowledged that the priest who said the Devil’s\r\nmass at the Sabbat wore a violet chasuble.[128] Gentien le Clerc, tried\r\nat Orleans in 1614-1615, was present at a Sabbat mass when the celebrant\r\n“wore a chasuble which was embroidered with a Cross; but there were\r\nonly three bars.”[129] Later a contemporary witness points to the use\r\nof vestments embroidered with infernal insignia, such as a dark red\r\nchasuble, the colour of dried blood, upon which was figured a black buck\r\ngoat rampant; a chasuble that bore the inverse Cross, and similar robes\r\nadorned by some needle with the heraldry of hell.\r\n\r\nIn bitter mockery of the _Asperges_ the celebrant sprinkled the witches\r\nwith filthy and brackish water, or even with stale. “The Devil at the\r\nsame time made water into a hole dug in the earth, & used it as holy\r\nwater, wherewith the celebrant of the mass sprinkled all present, using\r\na black aspergillum.”[130] Silvain Nevillon, a sorcerer who was tried\r\nat Orleans in 1614-1615, said: “When Tramesabot said Mass, before he\r\ncommenced he used to sprinkle all present with holy water which was\r\nnothing else than urine, saying meanwhile _Asperges Diaboli_.”[131]\r\nAccording to Gentien le Clerc: “The holy water is yellow ... & after\r\nit has been duly sprinkled Mass is said.”[132] Madeleine de la Palud\r\ndeclared that the sorcerers were sprinkled with water, and also with\r\nconsecrated wine from the chalice upon which all present cried aloud:\r\n_Sanguis eius super nos et super filios nostros._[133] (His blood be upon\r\nus and upon our children.)\r\n\r\nThis foul travesty of the holiest mysteries began with an invocation\r\nof the Devil, which was followed by a kind of general confession, only\r\neach one made mock acknowledgement of any good he might have done, and\r\nas a penance he was enjoined to utter some foul blasphemy or to break\r\nsome precept of the Church. The president absolved the congregation by\r\nan inverse sign of the Cross made with the left hand. The rite then\r\nproceeded with shameless profanity, but De Lancre remarks that the\r\n_Confiteor_ was never said, not even in a burlesque form, and _Alleluia_\r\nnever pronounced. After reciting the Offertory the celebrant drew back\r\na little from the altar and the assembly advancing in file kissed his\r\nleft hand. When the Queen of the Sabbat—the witch who ranked first after\r\nthe Grand Master, the oldest and most evil of the witches (“en chasque\r\nvillage,” says De Lancre, “trouuer vne Royne du Sabbat”)—was present she\r\nsat on the left of the altar and received the offerings, loaves, eggs,\r\nany meat or country produce, and money, so long as the coins were not\r\nstamped with a cross. In her hand she held a disc or plate “vne paix ou\r\nplatine,” engraved with a figure of the Devil, and this his followers\r\ndevoutly kissed. In many places to-day, especially Belgium, during Holy\r\nMass the pax-brede (_instrumentum pacis_) is kissed by the congregation\r\nat the Offertory, and universally when Mass is said by a priest in the\r\npresence of a Prelate the pax-brede is kissed by the officiant and the\r\nPrelate after the _Agnus Dei_ and the first appropriate ante-communion\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nSilvain Nevillon, who was tried at Orleans in 1614-15, avowed: “The Devil\r\npreached a sermon at the Sabbat, but nobody could hear what he said, for\r\nhe spoke in a growl.”[134]\r\n\r\nAt the Sabbat a sermon is not infrequently delivered, a farrago of\r\nimpiety and evil counsel.\r\n\r\nThe hosts are then brought to the altar. Boguet describes them as dark\r\nand round, stamped with a hideous design; Madeleine Bavent saw them as\r\nordinary wafers only coloured red; in other cases they were black and\r\ntriangular in shape. Often they blasphemed the Host, calling it “Iean le\r\nblanc,” just as Protestants called it “Jack-in-the-box.” The chalice is\r\nfilled, sometimes with wine, sometimes with a bitter beverage that burned\r\nthe tongue like fire. At the _Sanctus_ a horn sounded harshly thrice,\r\nand torches burning with a sulphurous blue flare “qui est fort puante”\r\nwere kindled. There was an elevation, at which the whole gang, now in\r\na state of hysterical excitement and unnatural exaltation, burst forth\r\nwith the most appalling screams and maniac blasphemies, rivalling each\r\nother in filthy adjurations and crapulous obscenities. The protagonist\r\npoured out all the unbridled venom that diabolic foulness could express,\r\na stream of scurrility and pollution; hell seemed to have vomited its\r\nreeking gorge on earth. _Domine adiuua nos, domine adiuua nos_, they\r\ncried to the Demon, and again _Domine adiuua nos semper_. Generally all\r\npresent were compelled to communicate with the sacrament of the pit, to\r\nswallow morsels soiled with mud and ordures, to drink the dark brew of\r\ndamnation. Gaufridi confessed that for _Ite missa est_ these infernal\r\norgies concluded with the curse: “Allez-vous-en tous au nom du diable!”\r\nWhilst the abbé Guibourg cried: “_Gloria tibi, Lucifero!_”\r\n\r\nThe black mass of the Sabbat varied slightly in form according to\r\ncircumstances, and in the modern liturgy of the Satanists it would appear\r\nthat a considerable feature is made of the burning of certain heavy and\r\nnoxious weeds, the Devil’s incense. In the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies the use of incense is very rare at the Sabbat, although Silvain\r\nNevillon stated that he had seen at the Sabbat “both holy water and\r\nincense. This latter smelled foul, not fragrant as incense burned in\r\nchurch.”[135]\r\n\r\nThe officiant nowadays consecrates a host and the chalice with the actual\r\nsacred words of Holy Mass, but then instead of kneeling he turns his back\r\nupon the altar,[136] and a few moments later—_sit uenia uerbis!_—he cuts\r\nand stabs the Host with a knife, throwing it to the ground, treading upon\r\nit, spurning it. A part, at least, of the contents of the chalice is\r\nalso spilled in fearful profanation, and not infrequently there further\r\nhas been provided a ciborium of consecrated Hosts, all stolen from\r\nchurches[137] or conveyed away at Communion in their mouths by wretches\r\nunafraid to provoke the sudden judgement of an outraged God. These the\r\nblack priest, for so the celebrant is called by the Devil worshippers,\r\nscatters over the pavement to be struggled and fought for by his\r\ncongregation in their madness to seize and outrage the Body of Christ.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the black mass of the Satanists and a plain\r\nsurvival from the Middle Ages is that grim superstition of the Gascon\r\npeasant, the Mass of S. Sécaire.[138] Few priests know the awful ritual,\r\nand of those who are learned in such dark lore fewer yet would dare to\r\nperform the monstrous ceremonies and utter the prayer of blasphemy. No\r\nconfessor, no bishop, not even the Archbishop of Auch, may shrive the\r\ncelebrant; he can only be absolved at Rome by the Holy Father himself.\r\nThe mass is said upon a broken and desecrated altar in some ruined or\r\ndeserted church where owls hoot and mope and bats flit through the\r\ncrumbling windows, where toads spit their venom upon the sacred stone.\r\nThe priest must make his way thither late attended only by an acolyte\r\nof impure and evil life. At the first stroke of eleven he begins; the\r\nliturgy of hell is mumbled backward, the canon said with a mow and a\r\nsneer; he ends just as midnight tolls. The host is triangular, with\r\nthree sharp points and black. No wine is consecrated but foul brackish\r\nwater drawn from a well wherein has been cast the body of an unbaptized\r\nbabe. The holy sign of the cross is made with the left foot upon the\r\nground. And the man for whom that mass is said will slowly pine away, nor\r\ndoctor’s skill nor physic will avail him aught, but he will suffer, and\r\ndwindle, and surely drop into the grave.[139]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is, no doubt, some picturesque exaggeration here the main\r\ndetails are correct enough. A black, triangular wafer is not infrequently\r\nmentioned in the witch-trials as having been the sacramental bread of\r\nthe Sabbat, whilst Lord Fountainhall[140] in describing the devilish\r\ncommunion of the Loudian witches says: “the drink was sometimes blood,\r\nsometimes black moss-water,” and many other details may be closely\r\nparalleled.\r\n\r\nWhen the blasphemous liturgy of the Sabbat was done all present gave\r\nthemselves up to the most promiscuous debauchery, only interrupting\r\ntheir lasciviousness to dance or to spur themselves on to new enormities\r\nby spiced foods and copious draughts of wine. “You may well suppose,”\r\nwrites Boguet, “that every kind of obscenity is practised there, yea,\r\neven those abominations for which Heaven poured down fire and brimstone\r\non Sodom and Gomorrah are quite common in these assemblies.”[141] The\r\nerudite Dominican, Father Sebastian Michaelis, who on the 19 January,\r\n1611, examined Madeleine de la Palud concerning her participation in\r\nSabbats, writes[142] that she narrated the most unhallowed orgies.[143]\r\nThe imagination reels before such turpitudes! But Madeleine Bavent (1643)\r\nsupplied even more execrable details.[144] Gentien le Clerc at Orleans\r\n(1614-1615) acknowledged similar debauchery.[145] Bodin relates that\r\na large number of witches whom he tried avowed their presence at the\r\nSabbat.[146] In 1459 “large numbers of men & women were burned at Arras,\r\nmany of whom had mutually accused one another, & they confessed that\r\nat night they had been conveyed to these hellish dances.”[147] In 1485\r\nSprenger executed a large number of sorcerers in the Constance district,\r\nand “almost all without exception confessed that the Devil had had\r\nconnexion with them, after he had made them renounce God and their holy\r\nfaith.”[148] Many converted witches likewise confessed these abominations\r\n“and let it be known that whilst they were witches demons had swived\r\nthem lustily. Henry of Cologne in confirmation of this says that it\r\nis very common in Germany.”[149] Throughout the centuries all erudite\r\nauthorities have the same monstrous tale to tell, and it would serve no\r\npurpose merely to accumulate evidence from the demonologists. To-day the\r\nmeetings of Satanists invariably end in unspeakable orgies and hideous\r\ndebauchery.\r\n\r\nOccasionally animals were sacrificed at the Sabbat to the Demon. The\r\nsecond charge against Dame Alice Kyteler, prosecuted in 1324 for sorcery\r\nby Richard de Ledrede, Bishop of Ossory, was “that she was wont to offer\r\nsacrifices to devils of live animals, which she and her company tore limb\r\nfrom limb and made oblation by scattering them at the cross-ways to a\r\ncertain demon who was called Robin, son of Artes (Robin Artisson), one of\r\nhell’s lesser princes.”[150]\r\n\r\nIn 1622 Margaret McWilliam “renounced her baptisme, and he baptised her\r\nand she gave him as a gift a hen or cock.”[151] In the Voodoo rites of\r\nto-day a cock is often the animal which is hacked to pieces before the\r\nfetish. Black puppies were sacrificed to Hecate; Æneas offers four jetty\r\nbullocks to the infernal powers, a coal-black lamb to Night;[152] at\r\ntheir Sabbat on the Esquiline Canidia and Sagana tear limb from limb\r\na black sheep, the blood streams into a trench.[153] Collin de Plancy\r\nstates that witches sacrifice black fowls and toads to the Devil.[154]\r\nThe animal victim to a power worshipped as divine is a relic of remotest\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nThe presence of toads at the Sabbat is mentioned in many witch-trials.\r\nThey seem to have been associated with sorcerers owing to the repugnance\r\nthey generally excite, and in some districts it is a common superstition\r\nthat those whom they regard fixedly will be seized with palpitations,\r\nspasms, convulsions, and swoons: nay, a certain abbé Rousseau of the\r\neighteenth century, who experimented with toads, avowed that when one of\r\nthese animals looked upon him for some time he fell in a fainting fit\r\nwhence, if help had not arrived, he would never have recovered.[155] A\r\nnumber of writers—Ælian, Dioscorides, Nicander, Ætius, Gesner—believe\r\nthat the breath of the toad is poisonous, infecting the places it\r\nmay touch. Since such idle stories were credited it is hardly to be\r\nsurprised at that we find the toad a close companion of the witch. De\r\nLancre says that demons often appeared in that shape. Jeannette d’Abadie,\r\na witch of the Basses-Pyrénées, whom he tried and who confessed at\r\nlength, declared that she saw brought to the Sabbat a number of toads\r\ndressed some in black, some in scarlet velvet, with little bells attached\r\nto their coats. In November, 1610, a man walking through the fields near\r\nBazas, noticed that his dog had scratched a large hole in a bank and\r\nunearthed two pots, covered with cloth, and closely tied. When opened\r\nthey were found to be packed with bran, and in the midst of each was a\r\nlarge toad wrapped in green tiffany. These doubtless had been set there\r\nby a person who had faith in sympathetic magic, and was essaying a\r\nmalefic spell. No doubt toads were caught and taken to the Sabbat, nor is\r\nthe reason far to seek. Owing to their legendary venom they served as a\r\nprime ingredient in poisons and potions, and were also used for telling\r\nfortunes, since witches often divined by their toad familiars. Juvenal\r\nalludes to this when he writes:\r\n\r\n    “I neither will, nor can Prognosticate\r\n    To the young gaping Heir, his Father’s Fate\r\n    Nor in the Entrails of a Toad have pry’d.”[156]\r\n\r\nUpon which passage Thomas Farnabie, the celebrated English scholar\r\n(1575-1647) glosses thus: “He alludes to the office of the Haruspex who\r\nused to inspect entrails & intestines. Pliny says: The entrails of the\r\ntoad (_Rana rubeta_), that is to say the tongue, tiny bones, gall, heart,\r\nhave rare virtue for they are used in many medicines and salves. Haply\r\nhe means the puddock or hop-toad, thus demonstrating that these animals\r\nare not poisonous, their entrails being completely inefficacious in\r\nconfecting poisons.”[157] In 1610 Juan de Echalar, a sorcerer of Navarre,\r\nconfessed at his trial before the Alcantarine inquisitor Don Alonso\r\nBecerra Holguin that he and his coven collected toads for the Sabbat,\r\nand when they presented these animals to the Devil he blessed them with\r\nhis left hand, after which they were killed and cooked in a stewpot with\r\nhuman bones and pieces of corpses rifled from new-made graves. From\r\nthis filthy hotch-potch were brewed poisons and unguents that the Devil\r\ndistributed to all present with directions how to use them. By sprinkling\r\ncorn with the liquid it was supposed they could blight a standing field,\r\nand also destroy flowers and fruit. A few drops let fall upon a person’s\r\ngarments was believed to insure death, and a smear upon the shed or sty\r\neffectually diseased cattle. From these crude superstitions the fantastic\r\nstories of dancing toads, toads dressed _en cavalier_, and demon toads at\r\nthe Sabbat were easily evolved.\r\n\r\nThere is ample and continuous evidence that children, usually tender\r\nbabes who were as yet unbaptized, were sacrificed at the Sabbat. These\r\nwere often the witches’ own offspring, and since a witch not unseldom was\r\nthe midwife or wise-woman of a village she had exceptional opportunities\r\nof stifling a child at birth as a non-Sabbatial victim to Satan. “There\r\nare no persons who can do more cunning harm to the Catholic faith than\r\nmidwives,” says the _Malleus Maleficarum_, Pars I, q. xi: “_Nemo fidei\r\ncatholicæ amplius nocet quam obstetrices._” The classic examples of\r\nchild-sacrifice are those of Gilles de Rais (1440) and the abbé Guibourg\r\n(1680). In the process against the former one hundred and forty children\r\nare explicitly named: some authorities accept as many as eight hundred\r\nvictims. Their blood, brains, and bones were used to decoct magic\r\nphiltres. In the days of Guibourg the sacrifice of a babe at the impious\r\nmass was so common that he generally paid not more than a crown-piece for\r\nhis victim. “Il avait acheté un écu l’enfant qui fut sacrifié à cette\r\nmesse.” (“The child sacrificed at this mass he had bought for a crown.”)\r\nThese abominable ceremonies were frequently performed at the instance of\r\nMadame de Montespan in order that Louis XIV should always remain faithful\r\nto her, should reject all other mistresses, repudiate his queen, and in\r\nfine raise her to the throne.[158] The most general use was to cut the\r\nthroat of the child, whose blood was drained into the chalice and allowed\r\nto fall upon the naked flesh of the inquirer, who lay stretched along\r\nthe altar. La Voisin asserted that a toll of fifteen hundred infants had\r\nbeen thus murdered. This is not impossible, as a vast number of persons,\r\nincluding a crowd of ecclesiastics, were implicated. Many of the greatest\r\nnames in France had assisted at these orgies of blasphemy. From first to\r\nlast no less than two hundred and forty-six men and women of all ranks\r\nand grades of society were brought to trial, and whilst thirty-six of\r\nhumbler station went to the scaffold, one hundred and forty-seven were\r\nimprisoned for longer or shorter terms, not a few finding it convenient\r\nto leave the country, or, at any rate, to obscure themselves in distant\r\nchâteaux. But many of the leaves had been torn out of the archives, and\r\nLouis himself forbade any mention of his favourite’s name in connexion\r\nwith these prosecutions. However, she was disgraced, and it is not\r\nsurprising that after the death of Maria Teresa, 31 July, 1683, the king\r\nearly in the following year married the pious and conventual Madame de\r\nMaintenon.\r\n\r\nLudovico Maria Sinistrari writes that witches “promise the Devil\r\nsacrifices and offerings at stated times: once a fortnight, or at least\r\neach month, the murder of some child, or an homicidal act of sorcery,”\r\nand again and again in the trials detailed accusation of the kidnapping\r\nand murder of children are brought against the prisoners. In the same\r\nway as the toad was used for magical drugs so was the fat of the child.\r\nThe belief that corpses and parts of corpses constitute a most powerful\r\ncure and a supreme ingredient in elixirs is universal and of the highest\r\nantiquity. The quality of directly curing diseases and of protection\r\nhas long been attributed to a cadaver. Tumours, eruptions, gout, are\r\ndispelled if the afflicted member be stroked with a dead hand.[159]\r\nToothache is charmed away if the face be touched with the finger of a\r\ndead child.[160] Birthmarks vanish under the same treatment.[161] Burns,\r\ncarbuncles, the herpes, and other skin complaints, fearfully prevalent in\r\nthe Middle Ages, could be cured by contact with some part of a corpse.\r\nIn Pomerania the “cold corpse hand” is a protection against fire,[162]\r\nand Russian peasants believe that a dead hand protects from bullet wounds\r\nand steel.[163] It was long thought by the ignorant country folk that the\r\ndoctors of the hospital of Graz enjoyed the privilege of being allowed\r\nevery year to exploit one human life for curative purposes. Some young\r\nman who repaired thither for toothache or any such slight ailment is\r\nseized, hung up by the feet, and tickled to death! Skilled chemists boil\r\nthe body to a paste and utilize this as well as the fat and the charred\r\nbones in their drug store. The people are persuaded that about Easter a\r\nyouth annually disappears in the hospital for these purposes.[164] This\r\ntradition is, perhaps, not unconnected with the Jewish ritual sacrifices\r\nof S. William of Norwich (1144); Harold of Gloucester (1168); William of\r\nParis (1177); Robert of Bury S. Edmunds (1181); S. Werner of Oberwesel\r\n(1286); S. Rudolph of Berne (1294); S. Andreas of Rinn (1462); S. Simon\r\nof Trent, a babe of two and a half years old (1473); Simon Abeles, whose\r\nbody lies in the Teyn Kirche at Prague, murdered for Christ’s sake on\r\n21 February, 1694, by Lazarus and Levi Kurtzhandel; El santo Niño de la\r\nGuardia, near Toledo (1490), and many more.[165]\r\n\r\nThe riots which have so continually during three centuries broken out in\r\nChina against Europeans, and particularly against Catholic asylums for\r\nthe sick, foundling hospitals, schools, are almost always fomented by an\r\nintellectual party who begin by issuing fiery appeals to the populace:\r\n“Down with the missionaries! Kill the foreigners! They steal or buy our\r\nchildren and slaughter them, in order to prepare magic remedies and\r\nmedicines out of their eyes, hearts, and from other portions of their\r\ndead bodies.” Baron Hübner in his _Promenade autour du monde_, II (Paris,\r\n1873) tells the story of the massacre at Tientsin, 21 June, 1870, and\r\nrelates that it was engineered on these very lines. In 1891 similar\r\nrisings against Europeans resident in China were found to be due to the\r\nsame cause. Towards the end of 1891 a charge was brought in Madagascar\r\nagainst the French that they devoured human hearts and for this purpose\r\nkidnapped and killed native children. Stern legislation was actually\r\nfound necessary to check the spread of these accusations.[166]\r\n\r\nIn the Navarrese witch-trials of 1610 Juan de Echelar confessed that a\r\ncandle had been used made from the arm of an infant strangled before\r\nbaptism. The ends of the fingers had been lit, and burned with a clear\r\nflame, a “Hand of Glory” in fact. At Forfar, in 1661, Helen Guthrie\r\nand four other witches exhumed the body of an unbaptized babe and made\r\nportions into a pie which they ate. They imagined that by this means no\r\nthreat nor torture could bring them to confession of their sorceries.\r\nThis, of course, is clearly sympathetic magic. The tongue of the infant\r\nhad never spoken articulate words, and so the tongues of the witches\r\nwould be unable to articulate.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact seldom realized, but none the less of the deepest\r\nsignificance, that almost every detail of the old witch-trials can be\r\nexactly paralleled in Africa to-day. Thus there exists in Bantu a society\r\ncalled the “Witchcraft Company,” whose members hold secret meetings at\r\nmidnight in the depths of the forest to plot sickness and death against\r\ntheir enemies by means of incantations and spells. The owl is their\r\nsacred bird, and their signal call an imitation of its hoot. They profess\r\nto leave their corporeal bodies asleep in their huts, and it is only\r\ntheir spirit-bodies that attend the magic rendezvous, passing through\r\nwalls and over the tree-tops with instant rapidity. At the meeting they\r\nhave visible, audible, and tangible communication with spirits. They\r\nhold feasts, at which is eaten the “heart-life” of some human being, who\r\nthrough this loss of his heart falls sick and, unless “the heart” be\r\nlater restored, eventually dies. Earliest cock-crow is the warning for\r\nthem to disperse, since they fear the advent of the morning-star, as,\r\nshould the sun rise upon them before they reach their corporeal bodies,\r\nall their plans would not merely fail, but recoil upon themselves,\r\nand they would pine and languish miserably. This hideous Society was\r\nintroduced by black slaves to the West Indies, to Jamaica and Hayti,\r\nand also to the Southern States of America as Voodoo worship. Authentic\r\nrecords are easily procurable which witness that midnight meetings were\r\nheld in Hayti as late as 1888, when human beings, especially kidnapped\r\nchildren, were killed and eaten at the mysterious and evil banquets.\r\nEuropean government in Africa has largely suppressed the practice of\r\nthe black art, but this foul belief still secretly prevails, and Dr.\r\nNorris[167] is of opinion that were white influence withdrawn it would\r\nsoon hold sway as potently as of old.\r\n\r\nA candid consideration will show that for every detail of the Sabbat,\r\nhowever fantastically presented and exaggerated in the witch-trials of so\r\nmany centuries, there is ample warrant and unimpeachable evidence. There\r\nis some hallucination no doubt; there is lurid imagination, and vanity\r\nwhich paints the colours thick; but there is a solid stratum of fact, and\r\nvery terrible fact throughout.\r\n\r\nAnd as the dawn broke the unhallowed crew separated in haste, and hurried\r\neach one on his way homewards, pale, weary, and haggard after the night\r\nof taut hysteria, frenzied evil, and vilest excess.\r\n\r\n“Le coq s’oyt par fois és sabbats sonna̅t le retraicte aux\r\nSorciers.”[168] (The cock crows; the Sabbat ends; the Sorcerers scatter\r\nand flee away.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n[1] Omnia autem honeste et secundum ordinem fiant. I Cor. xiv. 40.\r\n\r\n[2] Miss Murray, misled no doubt by the multiplicity of material,\r\npostulates two separate and distinct kinds of assemblies: The Sabbat, the\r\nGeneral Meeting of all members of the religion; the Esbat “only for the\r\nspecial and limited number who carried out the rites and practices of the\r\ncult, and [which] was not for the general public.” _The Witch-Cult in\r\nWestern Europe_, p. 97. Görres had already pointed out that the smaller\r\nmeetings were often known as _Esbats_. The idea of a “general public” at\r\na witches’ meeting is singular.\r\n\r\n[3] On a voulu trouver l’etymologie du sabbat, réunion des sorciers,\r\ndans les _sabazies_; mais la forme ne le permet pas; d’ailleurs comment,\r\nau moyen âge aurait on connu les sabazies? Saint-Croix, _Recherches sur\r\nles mystères du paganisme_; Maury, _Histoire des religions de la Grèce\r\nantique_.\r\n\r\n[4] _Metamorphoseon_, VIII. 25.\r\n\r\n[5] Miss Murray thinks that Sabbat “is possibly a derivative of\r\n_s’esbattre_, ‘to frolic,’” and adds “a very suitable description of the\r\njoyous gaiety of the meetings”!!\r\n\r\n[6] Miss Murray mistakenly says (p. 109) that May Eve (30 April) is\r\ncalled Roodmas or Rood Day. Roodmas or Rood Day is 3 May, the Feast of\r\nthe Invention of Holy Cross. An early English calendar (702-706) even\r\ngives 7 May as Roodmas. The Invention of Holy Cross is found in the\r\nLectionary of Silos and the Bobbio Missal. The date was not slightly\r\naltered. The Invention of Holy Cross is among the very early festivals.\r\n\r\n[7] Especially in the North and North-East. Bavaria, Wurtemberg, and\r\nBaden, knew little of this particular date.\r\n\r\n[8] In the _Rituale_ we have “Benedictio Rogi, quæ fit a Clero extra\r\nEcclesiam in Uigilia Natiuitatis S. Joannis Baptistæ.” (Blessing of a\r\npyre, which the Clergy may give on the Vigil of the Nativity of S. John\r\nBaptist, but outside the Church.) This form is especially approved for\r\nthe Diocese of Tarbes.\r\n\r\n[9] _Relacion de las personas que salieron al auto de la fé que los\r\ninquisidores apostólicos del reino de Navarra y su distrito, celebraron\r\nen la ciudad De Logroño, en 7 y 8 del mes de noviembre de 1610 años_,\r\n1611.\r\n\r\n[10] _Discours des Sorciers_, XXII. 12.

De ce qui se fait au Sabbat.\r\n\r\n    1. _Les Sorciers y adorent Satan, estăt en forme d’homme noir,\r\n    ou de bouc, & luy offrent des chandelles, & le baisent aux\r\n    parties honteuses de derriere._\r\n\r\n    2. _Ils y dansent, & de leurs danses._\r\n\r\n    3. _Ils se desbordent en toutes sortes de lubricitez, & comme\r\n    Satan se fait Incube & Succube._\r\n\r\n    4. _Incestes, & paillardises execrebles des Euchites &\r\n    Gnostiques._\r\n\r\n    5. _Les Sorciers banquettent au Sabbat, de leurs viandes, &\r\n    breuuages, & de la façon qu’ils tiennent à benir la table, & à\r\n    rendre graces._\r\n\r\n    6. _Ils ne prennent cependant point de gout aux Viandes, &\r\n    sortent ordinairement auec faim du repas._\r\n\r\n    7. _Le repas paracheué, ils rendent conte de leurs actions à\r\n    Satan._\r\n\r\n    8. _Ils renoncent de nouueau à Dieu, au Chresme, &c. Et comme\r\n    Satan les sollicite à mal faire._\r\n\r\n    9. _Ils y font la gresle._\r\n\r\n    10. _Ils y celebrent messe, & de leurs chappes, & eau benite._\r\n\r\n    11. _Satan se consume finalement en feu, & se reduit en cendre,\r\n    de laquelle les Sorciers prennent tous, & a quel effet._\r\n\r\n    12. _Satan Singe de Dieu en tout._\r\n\r\n\r\n[66] Vouloir donner une description du Sabbat, c’est vouloir decrire ce\r\nqui n’existe point, & n’a jamais subsisté que dans l’imagination creuse\r\n& séduite des Sorciers & Sorcieres: les peintures qu’on nous en fait,\r\nsont d’après les rêveries de ceux & de celles qui s’imaginent d’être\r\ntransportés à travers les airs au Sabbat en corps & en ame. _Traité sur\r\nles Apparitions des Esprits_, par le R.

La premiere c’est à\r\nla Bohemienne.... La seconde c’est à sauts: ces deux sont en rond. Sir\r\nJohn Davies in his _Orchestra or A Poeme on Dauncing_, London, 18mo,\r\n1596, describes the seven movements of the Cransles (Crawls) as:\r\n\r\n    _Upward_ and _downeward_, _forth_ and _back againe_,\r\n    _To this side_ and _to that_, and _turning round_.\r\n\r\n[94] II. 1.\r\n\r\n[95] Sinclar, _Satan’s Invisible World Discovered_, III.\r\n\r\n[96] _Newes from Scotland_,(1592).\r\n\r\n[97] Tota turba colluuiesque pessima fescenninos in honorem dæmonum\r\ncantat obscenissimos.

Parfois il y a plusieurs tables\r\nseruies de bons viures & d’autres fois de tres meschans. “Les Sorciers\r\n... banquettent & se festoient,” remarks Boguet, “leur banquets estans\r\ncomposez de plusieurs sortes de viandes, selon les lieux & qualitez des\r\npersonnes.” _Tableau_, p. 197. _Discours des Sorciers_, p. 135.\r\n\r\n[100] Sinclar, _Invisible World Discovered_, Relation XXIX.\r\n\r\n[101] Ils banquêtent, dressant trois tables selon les trois diversités\r\ndes gens susnommés. Ceux qui ont la charge du pain, ils portent le pain\r\nqu’ils font de blé dérobé aux aires invisiblement en divers lieux. Ils\r\nboivent de la malvoisie, pour eschauffer la chair à la luxure, que les\r\ndéputés portent, la dérobant des caves où elle se trouve. Ils y mangent\r\nordinairement de la chair des petits enfants que les députés cuisent à\r\nla Synagogue et parfois les y portent tout vifs, les dérobant à leurs\r\nmaisons quand ils trouvent la commodité. Père Sébastien Michaëlis, O.P.\r\n_Histoire admirable de la possession_, 1613.\r\n\r\n[102] On y boit aussi du vin, et le plus souvent de l’eau.\r\n\r\n[103] Conuiuant de cibis a se uel a dæmone allatis, interdum\r\ndelicatissimis, et interdum insipidis ex infantibus occisis aut\r\ncadaueribus exhumatis, præcedente tamen benedictione mensæ tali coetu\r\ndigna. _Salamanticenses_, Tr. xxi. c. 11.

Miss Murray, _The\r\nWitch-Cult_, p. 149, suggests that this sprinkling was “a fertility\r\nrite”! An astounding theory. This blasphemy, of course, alludes to the\r\ncurse of the Jews, S. Matthew xxvii. 25.\r\n\r\n[134] Que le Diable dit le Sermo au Sabbat, mais qu’on n’entend ce qu’il\r\ndit, parce qu’il parle com̅e en gro̅dant. Which suggests the wearing of a\r\nmask, or, at least, a voice purposely disguised.\r\n\r\n[135] Dit qu’il a veu bailler au Sabbat du pain benist & de l’encens,\r\nmais il ne sentoit bon comme celuy de l’Eglise.\r\n\r\n[136] So in the Orleans trial Gentil le Clerc confessed that the Devil\r\n“tourne le dos à l’Autel quand il veut leuer l’Hostie & le Calice, qui\r\nsont noirs.”\r\n\r\n[137] Silvain Nevillon, (1614-1615).

Cæsarius of Arles, 470-543, who incidentally was\r\nfamous for eradicating the last traces of Pagan superstitions and\r\npractices. He imposed the penalty of excommunication upon all those who\r\nconsulted augurs and wore heathen amulets.

Puis on se met à table.... Dit qu’il a cognu\r\ndes hommes & s’est accouplé auec eux; qu’il auoit vne couppe on gondolle\r\npar le moyen de laquelle toutes les femmes le suiuoient pour y boire.\r\n\r\n[146] Apres la danse finie les diables se couchere̅t auecques elles, &\r\neure̅t leur co̅pagnie.\r\n\r\n[147] ... grand nombre d’hommes & femmes furent bruslees en la ville\r\nd’Arras, accusees les vns par les autres, & co̅fesserent qu’elles\r\nestoient la nuict transportees aux danses, & puis qu’ils se couploient\r\nauecques les diables, qu’ils adoroient en figure humaine.\r\n\r\n[148] ... toutes generalement sans exception, confessoient que le diable\r\nauoit copulation charnelle auec elles, apres leur auoir fait renoncer\r\nDieu & leur religion.\r\n\r\n[149] ... c’est à sçauoir que les diables, ta̅t qu’elles auoient esté\r\nSorcieres, auoie̅t eu copulation auec elles.

Some terms are of general import,\r\none might even venture to say vague and not exactly defined, some are\r\ndirectly specific: of some phrases the signification is plain and\r\naccepted; concerning others, scholars are still undecided and differ more\r\nor less widely amongst themselves. Yet it is noteworthy that from the\r\nvery earliest period the attitude of the inspired writers towards magic\r\nand related practices is almost wholly condemnatory and uncompromisingly\r\nhostile. The vehement and repeated denunciations launched against the\r\nprofessors of occult sciences and the initiate in foreign esoteric\r\nmysteries do not, moreover, seem to be based upon any supposition of\r\nfraud but rather upon the “abomination” of the magic in itself, which\r\nis recognized as potent for evil and able to wreak mischief upon life\r\nand limb. It is obvious, for example, that the opponents of Moses, the\r\nsorcerers[1] Jannes and Mambres, were masters of no mean learning and\r\npower, since when, in the presence of Pharaoh, Aaron’s rod became a live\r\nserpent, they also and their mob of disciples “fecerunt per incantationes\r\nÆgyptiacas et arcana quædam similiter,” casting down their rods, which\r\nwere changed into a mass of writhing snakes. They were able also to bring\r\nup frogs upon the land, but it was past their wit to drive them away.\r\nWe have here, however, a clear acknowledgement of the reality of magic\r\nand its dark possibilities, whilst at the same time prominence is given\r\nto the fact that when it contests with the miraculous power divinely\r\nbestowed upon Moses it fails hopelessly and completely. The serpent,\r\nwhich was Aaron’s rod, swallows all the other serpents. The swarms of\r\nmosquitoes and gadflies which Aaron caused to rise in myriads from the\r\ndust the native warlocks could not produce, nay, they were constrained\r\nto cry “Digitus Dei est hic”; whilst a little later they were unable to\r\nprotect even their own bodies from the pest of blains and swelling sores.\r\nNone the less a supernatural power was possessed by Jannes and Mambres\r\nas truly as by Moses, although not to the same extent, and derived from\r\nanother, in fact, from an opposite and antagonistic source.\r\n\r\nEven more striking is the episode of Balaam, who dwelt at Pethor, a\r\ncity of Mesopotamia (the Pitru of the cuneiform texts), and who was\r\nsummoned thence by Balak, King of Moab, to lay a withering curse upon\r\nthe Israelites, encamped after their victory over the Amorrhites at the\r\nvery confines of his territory. The royal messengers come to Balaam “with\r\nthe rewards of divination in their hand,” a most illuminating detail,\r\nfor it shows that already the practice of magical arts is rewarded with\r\ngifts of great value.[2] In fact when Balaam refuses, although with\r\nreluctance, to accompany the first embassy, princes of the highest rank\r\nare then sent to him with injunctions to offer him rank and wealth or\r\nwhatsoever he may care to ask. “I will promote thee to very great honour,\r\nand I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me; come, therefore, and curse\r\nthis people,” are the king’s actual words. After great difficulties, for\r\nBalaam is, at first, forbidden to go and only wins his way on condition\r\nthat he undertakes to do what he is commanded and to speak no more than\r\nhe is inspired to say, the seer commences his journey and is met by\r\nthe king at a frontier town, and by him taken up “unto the high places\r\nof Baal,” to the sacred groves upon the hill-tops, where seven mystic\r\naltars are built, and a bullock and a ram offered upon each. Balaam then\r\nsenses the imminent presence of God, and withdraws swiftly apart to some\r\nsecret place where “God met” him. He returns to the scene of sacrifice\r\nand forthwith blesses the Israelites. Balak in consternation and dismay\r\nhurries him to the crest of Pisgah (Phasga), and the same ceremonies are\r\nperformed. But again Balaam pours forth benisons upon the people. A third\r\nattempt is made, and this time was chosen the summit of Peor (Phogor), a\r\npeculiarly sacred sanctuary, the centre of the local cult of Baal Peor,\r\nwhose ancient worship comprised a ritual of most primitive obscenity.[3]\r\nAgain the sevenfold sacrifice is offered upon seven altars, and this\r\ntime Balaam deliberately resists the divine control, a vain endeavour,\r\nsince he passes into trance, and utters words of ineffable benediction\r\ngazing down the dim avenues of futurity to the glorious vision of the\r\nMadonna, Stella Jacob, and her Son, the Sceptre of Israel. Beating his\r\nclenched hands together in an access of ungovernable fury the choused and\r\nexasperated king incontinently dismisses his guest.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked that throughout the whole of this narrative, the\r\ndetails of which are as interesting as they are significant, there is on\r\nthe part of the writer a complete recognition of the claims put forth by\r\nBalaam and so amply acknowledged and appreciated by Balak. Balaam was a\r\nfamous sorcerer, and one, moreover, who knew and could launch the mystic\r\nWord of Power with deadly effect. Among the early Arabs as among the\r\nIsraelites the magic spell, the Word of Blessing or the Curse, played a\r\nprominent part. In war, the poet, by cursing the enemy in rhythmic runes,\r\nrendered services not inferior to the heroism of the warrior himself.\r\nSo the Jews of Medina used to bring into their synagogues images of\r\ntheir hated enemy Malik b. al-Aglam; and at these effigies they hurled\r\nmaledictions each time they met. The reality of Balaam’s power is clearly\r\nthe key-note of the Biblical account. Else why should his services be\r\ntransferred to the cause of Israel? Balak’s greeting to the seer is no\r\nempty compliment but vitally true: “I wot that he whom thou blessest is\r\nblessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.” Not impertinent is the\r\nbitter denunciation in the song of Deborah, Judges v. 23, “Curse ye me\r\nMeroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants\r\nthereof; because they came not to the help of the Lord against the\r\nmighty!” (A.V.) Belief in the potency of the uttered word has existed at\r\nall times and in all places, and yet continues to exist everywhere to-day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Balaam prophesied it must be borne in mind that he was not a\r\nprophet in the Scriptural sense of the term; he was a soothsayer, a\r\nwizard; the Vulgate has _hariolus_,[4] which is derived from the Sanskrit\r\n_hira_, entrails, and equivalent to _haruspex_. This term originally\r\ndenoted an Etruscan diviner who foretold future events by an inspection\r\nof the entrails of sacrificial victims. It was from the Etruscans\r\nthat this practice was introduced to the Romans. It is probable that\r\nBalaam employed the seven bullocks and rams in this way, the technical\r\n_extispicium_, a method of inquiry and forecasting which seems to have\r\nbeen almost universal, although the exact manner in which the omens\r\nwere read differed among the several peoples and at various times. It\r\npersisted, none the less, until very late, and indeed it is resorted to,\r\nso it has been said, by certain occultists even at the present day. It is\r\nknown to have been practised by Catherine de’ Medici, and it is closely\r\nconnected with the dark Voodoo worship of Jamaica and Hayti. S. Thomas,\r\nit is true, has spoken of Balaam as a prophet, but the holy doctor\r\nhastens to add “a prophet of the devil.” The learned Cornelius à Lapide,\r\nglossing upon Numbers xxii and xxiii writes: “It is clear that Balaam\r\nwas a prophet, not of God, but of the Devil.... He was a magician, and\r\nhe sought for a conference with his demon to take counsel with him.”[5]\r\nHe is of opinion that the seven altars were erected in honour of the\r\nLords of the Seven Planets. Seven is, of course, the perfect number, the\r\nmystic number, even as three; and all must be done by odd numbers. The\r\nwoman in Vergil who tries to call back her estranged lover Daphnis by\r\npotent incantations cries: _numero deus impare gaudet_. (Heaven loves\r\nunequal numbers.) Eclogue viii. 75 (_Pharmaceutria_). S. Augustine, S.\r\nAmbrose, and Theodoret consider that when Balaam on the first occasion\r\nwithdrew hastily saying “Peradventure the Lord will come to meet me,” he\r\nexpected to meet a demon, his familiar. But “God met Balaam.” The very\r\nprecipitation and disorder seem to point to the design of the sorcerer,\r\nfor as in the Divine Liturgy all is done with due dignity, grace, and\r\ncomeliness, so in the functions of black magic all is hurried, ugly, and\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking episodes in the Old Testament is concerned with\r\nnecromancy, the appearance of Samuel in the cave or hut at Endor. Saul,\r\non the eve of a tremendous battle with the Philistines, is much dismayed\r\nand almost gives away to a complete nervous collapse as he sees the\r\noverwhelming forces of the ruthless foe. To add to his panic, when he\r\nconsulted the Divine Oracles, no answer was returned, “neither by dreams,\r\nnor by Urim, nor by prophets.” And although he had in the earlier years\r\nof his reign shown himself a determined represser of Witchcraft, in his\r\ndire extremity he catches at any straw, and bids his servants seek out\r\nsome woman “that hath a familiar spirit,” and his servants said to him,\r\n“Behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor,” which is\r\na miserable hamlet on the northern slope of a hill, lying something south\r\nof Mount Tabor.\r\n\r\nThe phrase here used, rendered by the Vulgate “pytho” (Quærite mihi\r\nmulierem habentem pythonem) and by the Authorized Version “familiar\r\nspirit,” is in the original _’ôbh_,[6] which signifies the departed\r\nspirit evoked, and also came to stand for the person controlling such a\r\nspirit and divining by its aid. The Witch of Endor is described as the\r\npossessor of an _’ôbh_. The LXX. translates this word by ἐγγαστράμυθος,\r\nwhich means ventriloquist, either because the real actors thought that\r\nthe magician’s alleged communication with the spirit was a mere deception\r\nto impose upon the inquirer who is tricked by the voice being thrown\r\ninto the ground and being of strange quality—a view which mightily\r\ncommends itself to Lenormant [7] and the sceptical Renan[8] but which\r\nis quite untenable—or rather because of the belief common in antiquity\r\nthat ventriloquism was not a natural faculty but due to the temporary\r\nobsession of the medium by a spirit. In this connexion the prophet\r\nIsaias has a remarkable passage: Quærite a pythonibus, et a diuinis qui\r\nstrident in incantationibus suis. (Seek unto them that have familiar\r\nspirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter. _A.V._) Many Greek\r\nand Latin poets attribute a peculiar and distinctive sound to the voices\r\nof spirits. Homer (_Iliad_, XXIII, 101; _Odyssey_, XXIV, 5, and 9) uses\r\nτρίξειν, which is elsewhere found of the shrill cry or chirping of\r\npartridges, young swallows, locusts, mice, bats,[9] and of such other\r\nsounds as the creaking of a door, the sharp crackling of a thing burned\r\nin a fire. Vergil _Æneid_, III, 39, speaks of the cry of Polydorus from\r\nhis grave as _gemitus lacrimabilis_, and the clamour of the spirits in\r\nHades is _uox exigua_. Horace also in his description of the midnight\r\nEsbat on the Esquiline describes the voice as _triste et acutum;_\r\n(_Sermonum_, I. viii, 40-1):\r\n\r\n    singula quid memorem, quo pacto alterna loquentes\r\n    umbrae cum Sagana resonarent triste et acutum.\r\n\r\nStatius, _Thebais_, VII, 770, has “stridunt animæ,” upon which Kaspar von\r\nBarth, the famous sixteenth-century German scholar, annotates “Homericum\r\nhoc est qui corporibus excedentes animas stridere excogitauit.” So in\r\nShakespeare’s well-known lines, _Hamlet_ I, 1:\r\n\r\n                          the sheeted dead\r\n    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.\r\n\r\nWhen he had been informed of this witch Saul, accordingly, completely\r\ndivested himself of the insignia of royalty and in a close disguise\r\naccompanied only by two of his most trusted followers similarly muffled\r\nin cloaks, he painfully made his way at dead of night to her remote and\r\nsqualid hovel. He eagerly requested her to exercise her powers, and to\r\nraise the spirit of the person whom he should name. At first she refused,\r\nsince some years before the laws had been stringently enforced and the\r\npenalty of death awaited all sorcerers and magicians. Not unreasonably\r\nshe feared that these mysterious strangers might be laying a trap for\r\nher, to imperil her life. But the concealed king persuaded her, and bound\r\nhimself by a mighty oath that she should come to no harm. Whereupon she\r\nconsented to evoke the soul of the prophet Samuel, as he desired. The\r\ncharm commenced, and after the vision of various familiars—the woman\r\nsaid: Deos uidi ascendentes de terra—and S. Gregory of Nyssa explains\r\nthese as demons, τὰ φαντάσματα,—Samuel appeared amid circumstances of\r\ngreat terror and awe, and in the same moment the identity of her visitant\r\nwas recognized (we are not informed how) by the sybil.[10] In a paroxysm\r\nof rage and fear the haggard crone turned to him and shrieked out: “Why\r\nhast thou deceived me? For thou art Saul.” The king, however, tremblingly\r\nreassured her for her own safety, and feeling that he was confronted\r\nby no earthly figure—he could not see the phantom, although he sensed\r\na presence from beyond the grave—he asked: “What form is he of?” And\r\nwhen the beldame, to whom alone the prophet was visible, described the\r\nspirit: “An old man cometh up, and he is covered with a mantle,” Saul at\r\nonce recognized Samuel, and fell prostrate upon the ground, whilst the\r\napparition spake his swiftly coming doom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI\r\n\r\nTHE WITCH OF ENDOR.\r\n\r\n[_face p. 178_]\r\n\r\nHere we have a detailed scene of necromancy proper. There are, it\r\nis true, some remarkable, and perhaps unusual, features: the witch\r\nalone sees the phantom, but Saul instantly knows who it is from her\r\ndescription; he directly addresses Samuel, and he hears the prediction of\r\nthe dead prophet. The whole narrative undoubtedly bears the impress of\r\nactuality and truth.\r\n\r\nThere are several interpretations of these incidents. In the first place\r\nsome writers have denied the reality of the vision, and so it is claimed\r\nthat the witch deceived Saul by skilful trickery. This hardly seems\r\npossible. It is not likely that she would have run so grave a risk as the\r\nexercise, or pretended exercise, of magical arts must entail were she\r\na mere charlatan; an accomplice of remarkably quick wit and invention\r\nwould have been necessary to carry out the details of the plot; it is\r\nsurely incredible that they should have ventured upon so uncompromising a\r\ndenunciation of the king and have foretold so evil an end to his house.\r\nIn fact the whole tenor of the story conflicts with this explanation,\r\nwhich is not allowed by the Fathers. Theodoret, it is true, inclines\r\nto suppose that some deception was practised, but he hesitates to\r\nmaintain an unequivocal opinion in the matter. In his _Quæstiones in I\r\nRegum_ Cap. xxviii he asks πῶς τὰ κατὰ τὴν ἐγγαστρίμυθον νοητέον;[11]\r\nand says that some think that the witch actually evoked Samuel, others\r\nbelieve the Devil took the likeness of the prophet. The first opinion he\r\ncharacterizes as impious, the second foolish.\r\n\r\nS. Jerome, whose authority would, of course, be entirely conclusive, does\r\nnot perhaps pronounce definitely; but his comments sufficiently show, I\r\nthink, that he regarded the apparition as being really Samuel. In his\r\ntractate _In Esaiam_, III, vii, he writes: “Most authors think that a\r\nclear sign was given Saul from the earth itself and from the very depths\r\nof Hades when he saw Samuel evoked by incantations and magic spells.”[12]\r\nAnd again, _In Ezechielem_, Lib. IV; xiii, the holy doctor, speaking of\r\nwitches, has: “they are inspired by an evil spirit. The Hebrews say that\r\nthey are well versed in baleful crafts, necromancy and soothsayings,\r\nsuch as was the hag who seemed to raise up the soul of Samuel.”[13]\r\n\r\nSome authors directly attribute this appearance of Samuel to an evil\r\nspirit, who took the form of the prophet in order to dishearten Saul\r\nand tempt him to despair. Thus S. Gregory of Nyssa in his letter _De\r\npythonissa ad Theodosium_[14] says that the Devil deceived the witch,\r\nwho thus in her turn deceived the king. S. Basil expressly lays down\r\n(_In Esaiam_, VIII. 218): “They were demons who assumed the appearance\r\nof Samuel.”[15] And he conjectures that, inasmuch as the denunciation\r\nof Saul was strictly true in every detail, the demons having heard\r\nthe sentence delivered by God merely reported it. Among the Latins\r\nTertullian, more than a century before, had written: “And I believe that\r\nevil spirits can deceive many by their lies; for a lying spirit was\r\nallowed to feign himself to be the shade of Samuel.”[16]\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of opinion, however, is decidedly in favour of a\r\nliteral and exact understanding of the event, that it was, in effect,\r\nSamuel who appeared to the guilty monarch and foretold his end. Origen\r\nargues upon these lines, basing his reasons upon the plain statements\r\nof Holy Writ: “But it is distinctly stated that Saul knew it was\r\nSamuel.”[17] And later he adds: “The Scripture cannot lie. And the words\r\nof Scripture are: And the woman saw Samuel.”[18] Elsewhere when treating\r\nof evil spirits he precisely states: “And that souls have their abiding\r\nplace I have made known to you from the evocation by the witch of Samuel,\r\nwhen Saul requested her to divine.”[19] S. Ambrose also says: “Even after\r\nhis death Samuel, as Holy Scripture informs us, prophesied of what was to\r\ncome.”[20] We have further the overwhelming witness of S. Augustine, who\r\nin more than one place discusses the question at some length, and decides\r\nthat the phantom evoked by the sibyl was really and truly the soul of the\r\nprophet Samuel. Thus in that important treatise _De Doctrina Christiana_,\r\ncommenced in 397 and finally revised for issue in 427, he has: “The shade\r\nof Samuel, long since dead, truly foretold what was to come unto King\r\nSaul.”[21] Whilst a passage in the even more famous and weighty _De Cura\r\npro mortuis gerenda_, written in 421, asserts: “For the prophet Samuel,\r\nwho was dead, revealed the future to King Saul, who was yet alive.”[22]\r\n\r\nJosephus believed the apparition to have been summoned by the witch’s\r\nnecromantic powers, for in his _Jewish Antiquities_, VI, xiv, 2, when\r\ndealing with the story of Endor, he chronicles: “[Saul] bade her bring up\r\nto him the soul of Samuel. She, not knowing who Samuel was, called him\r\nout of Hades,”[23] a remarkable testimony.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of the Old Testament the sin of necromancy is\r\ncondemned in the strongest terms, but the very reiteration of this ban\r\nshows that none the less evocation of the dead was extensively and\r\ncontinuously practised, albeit in the most clandestine and secret manner.\r\nThe Mosaic law denounces such arts again and again: “Go not aside after\r\nwizards, neither ask any thing of soothsayers, to be defiled by them: I\r\nam the Lord your God” (Leviticus xix. 31); “The soul that shall go aside\r\nafter magicians and soothsayers, and shall commit fornication with them,\r\nI will set my face against that soul, and destroy it out of the midst of\r\nits people” (Leviticus xx. 6). Even more explicit in its details is the\r\nfollowing prohibition: “Neither let there be found among you any one ...\r\nthat consulteth soothsayers, or observeth dreams and omens, neither let\r\nthere be any wizard, nor charmer, nor any one that consulteth pythonic\r\nspirits, or fortune tellers, or that seeketh the truth from the dead. For\r\nthe Lord abhorreth all these things” (Deuteronomy xviii. 10-12). Hence it\r\nis obvious that the essential malice of the sin lay in the fact that it\r\nwas _lèse-majesté_ against God, such as is also the sin of heresy.[24]\r\nThis is, moreover, clearly brought out in the fact that the temporal\r\npenalty was death. “A man, or woman, in whom there is a pythonical\r\nor divining spirit, dying, let them die” (Leviticus xx. 27). And the\r\nfamous statute, Exodus xxii. 18, expressly says: “Wizards thou shalt not\r\nsuffer to live.” Nevertheless, necromancy persisted, and on occasion,\r\nsuch as during the reign of Manasses, thirteenth king of Juda (692-638\r\nB.C.),[25] it no longer lurked in dark corners and obscene hiding-holes,\r\nbut flaunted its foul abomination unabashed in the courts of the palace\r\nand at noon before the eyes of the superstitious capital. In the days of\r\nthis monarch divination was openly used, omens observed, pythons publicly\r\nappointed, whilst soothsayers multiplied “to do evil before the Lord, and\r\nto provoke Him” (4 Kings [2 Kings] xxi. 6). The ghastly rites of human\r\nsacrifice were revived, and it was common knowledge that the sovereign\r\nhimself, upon the slightest and most indifferent pretexts, resorted to\r\n_extispicium_, the seeking of omens from the yet palpitating entrails\r\nof boys devoted to this horrid purpose. “Manasses shed also very much\r\ninnocent blood, till he filled Jerusalem up to the mouth” (4 Kings [2\r\nKings] xxi. 16). We may parallel the foul sorceries of the Jewish king\r\nwith the detailed confession of Gilles de Rais, who at his trial “related\r\nhow he had stolen away children, detailed all his foul cajolements,\r\nhis hellish excitations, his frenzied murders, his ruthless rapes and\r\nravishments: obsessed by the morbid vision of his poor pitiful victims,\r\nhe described at length their long-drawn agonies or swift torturings;\r\ntheir piteous cries and the death-rattle in their throats; he avowed that\r\nhe had wallowed in their warm entrails; he confessed that he had torn\r\nout their hearts through large gaping wounds, as a man might pluck ripe\r\nfruit.”[26] The demonolatry of the sixth century before Christ is the\r\nsame as that of fourteen hundred years after the birth of Our Lord.\r\n\r\nAs has been previously noticed, Balaam employed bullocks and rams for\r\n_extispicium_, and nine centuries later, in the book of Ezechiel (xxi.\r\n21), Esarhaddon is represented as looking at the liver of an animal\r\noffered in sacrifice with a view to divination. “For the king of Babylon\r\nstood in the highway, at the head of two ways, seeking divination,\r\nshuffling arrows: he inquired of the idols, and consulted entrails. On\r\nhis right hand was the divination of Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to\r\nopen the mouth in slaughter.” The mode of sortilege by arrows, belomancy,\r\nto which allusion is here made was extensively practised among the\r\nChaldeans, as also by the Arabs. Upon this passage S. Jerome comments:\r\n“He shall stand in the highway, and consult the oracle after the manner\r\nof his nation, that he may cast arrows into a quiver, and mix them\r\ntogether, being written upon or marked with the names of each people,\r\nthat he may see whose arrow will come forth, and which city he ought\r\nfirst to attack.”\r\n\r\nAmong the three hundred and sixty idols which stood round about the Caaba\r\nof Mecca, and which were all destroyed by Mohammed when he captured the\r\ncity in the eighth year of the Hejira, was the statue of a man, made of\r\nagate, who held in one hand seven arrows such as the pagan Arabs used in\r\ndivination. This figure, which, it is said, anciently represented the\r\npatriarch Abraham, was regarded with especial awe and veneration.\r\n\r\nThe arrows employed by the early Arabs for magical practices were more\r\ngenerally only three in number. They were carefully preserved in the\r\ntemple of some idol, before whose shrine they had been consecrated. Upon\r\none of them was inscribed “My Lord hath commanded me”; upon another “My\r\nLord hath forbidden me”; and the third was blank. If the first was drawn\r\nthe inquirer looked upon it as a propitious omen promising success in the\r\nenterprise; if the second were drawn he augured failure; if the third,\r\nall three were mixed again and another trial was made. These divining\r\narrows seem always to have been consulted by the Arabs before they\r\nengaged in any important undertaking, as, for example, when a man was\r\nabout to go upon a particular journey, to marry, to commence some weighty\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases and in many countries rods were used instead of arrows.\r\nSmall sticks were marked with occult signs, thrown into a vessel and\r\ndrawn out; or, it might be, cast into the air, the direction they\r\ntook and the position in which they fell being carefully noted. This\r\npractice is known as rhabdomancy. The LXX, indeed, Ezechiel xxi. 21, has\r\nῥαβδομαντεία not βελομαντεία, and rhabdomancy is mentioned by S. Cyril of\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\nIn the Koran, chapter V, The Table or The Chapter of Contracts, “divining\r\narrows” are said to be “an abomination of the work of Satan,” and the\r\ninjunction is given “therefore avoid them that ye may prosper.”\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that in the early Biblical narrative one form of\r\ndivination is mentioned, if not with approval, at any rate without overt\r\nreproach. Upon the occasion of the second journey of Jacob’s sons to\r\nEgypt to buy corn in the time of famine, Joseph gave orders that their\r\nsacks were to be filled with food, that each man’s money was to be put\r\nin the mouth of his sack, but that in the sack of Benjamin was also to\r\nbe concealed the “cup, the silver cup.” And the next morning when they\r\nhad set out homewards and were gone a little way out of the city they\r\nwere overtaken by a band of Joseph’s servants under the conduct of his\r\nsteward who arrested their progress and accused them of the theft of\r\nthe cup: “Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed\r\nhe divineth? Ye have done evil in so doing” (_A.V._). The Vulgate has:\r\n“Scyphus quem furati estis, ipse est in quo bibit dominus meus et in quo\r\naugurari solet: pessimam rem fecistis” (Genesis xliv. 5). And later when\r\nthey are brought back in custody and led into the presence of Joseph\r\nhe asks them: “Wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?”\r\nVulgate: “An ignoratis quod non sit similis mei in augurandi scientia?”\r\n\r\nIn the first place it cannot be for a moment supposed that Joseph’s\r\nclaim, which here he so publicly and so emphatically states, to be\r\na diviner of no ordinary powers was a mere device for the occasion.\r\nFrom the prominence given to the cup in the story it is clear that his\r\nsteward regarded it as a vessel of especial value and import, dight with\r\nmysterious properties.\r\n\r\nThis cup was used for that species of divination known as hydromantia,\r\na practice almost universal in antiquity and sufficiently common at the\r\npresent day. The seer, or in some cases the inquirer, by gazing fixedly\r\ninto a pool or basin of still water will see therein reflected as in a\r\nmirror a picture of that which it is sought to know. Strabo, XVI, 2,\r\n39, speaking of the Persians, writes: παρὰδε τοῖς πέρσαις οἱ Μάγοι καὶ\r\nνεκυομάντεις καὶ ἔτι οἱ λεγόμενοι λεκανομάντεις καὶ ὑδρομάντεις. King\r\nNuma, according to one very ancient tradition, divined by seeing gods in\r\na clear stream. “For Numa himself, not being instructed by any prophet\r\nor Angel of God, was fain to fall to hydromancy: making his gods (or\r\nrather his devils) to appear in water, and instruct him in his religious\r\ninstitutions. Which kind of divination, says Varro, came from Persia and\r\nwas used by Numa and afterwards by Pythagoras, wherein they used blood\r\nalso and called forth spirits infernal. Necromancy, the Greeks call it,\r\nbut necromancy or hydromancy, whether you like, there it is that the dead\r\nseem to speak” (_S. Augustine De Ciuitate Dei_. VII. 35).[27]\r\n\r\nApuleius in his _De Magia_,[28] quoting from Varro, says: “Trallibus de\r\neuentu Mithridatici belli magica percontatione consultantibus puerum\r\nin aqua simulacrum Mercuri contemplantem, quæ futura erant, centum\r\nsexaginta uersibus cecinisse.” In Egypt to-day the Magic Mirror is\r\nfrequently consulted. A boy is engaged to gaze into a splash of water,\r\nor it may be ink or some other dark liquid poured into the palm of the\r\nhand, and therein he will assuredly see pictorially revealed the answers\r\nto those questions put to him. When a theft has been committed the Magic\r\nMirror is invariably questioned thus. In Scandinavia the country folk,\r\nwho had lost anything, would go to a diviner on a Thursday night to see\r\nin a pail of water who it was had robbed them.[29] All the world over\r\nthis belief prevails, in Tahiti and among the Hawaiians, in the Malay\r\nPeninsula, in New Guinea, among the Eskimos.\r\n\r\nSimilar forms of divination are those by things dropped into some liquid,\r\na precious stone or rich amulet is cast into a cup, and the rings\r\nformed on the surface of the contents were held to predict the future.\r\nAgain warm wax or molten lead is poured into a vessel of cold water,\r\nand significant letters of the alphabet may be spelled out or objects\r\ndiscerned from the shapes this wax or lead assumes; or again, the empty\r\ntea-cup is tilted and from the leaves, their size, shape, and the manner\r\nin which they lie, prognostications are made. This is common in England,\r\nScotland, Ireland, Sweden, Lithuania, whilst in Macedonia coffee-dregs\r\nare employed in the same manner.\r\n\r\nBut whether the seer be Hebrew patriarch or Roman king and the divination\r\ndignified by some occult name, Ceromancy (the melting of wax),\r\nLecanomancy (basins of water), Oinomancy (the lees of wine), or whether\r\nit be some old plaid-shawled grandam by her cottage fire peering at the\r\nleaves of her afternoon tea, the object is the same throughout the ages,\r\nfor all systems of divination are merely so many methods of obscuring the\r\nouter vision, in order that the inner vision may become open.\r\n\r\nAs was inevitable hydromantia lent itself to much trickery, and\r\nHippolytus of Rome, presbyter and antipope (_ob._ _circa_ A.D. 236),\r\nin his important polemic against heretics, _Philosophumena_,[30] IV,\r\n35, explains in detail how persons were elaborately duped by the\r\npseudo-magicians. A room was prepared, the roof of which was painted blue\r\nto resemble the sky, there was set therein a large vessel full of water\r\nwith a glass bottom, immediately under which lay a secret chamber. The\r\ninquirer gazed steadfastly into the water, and the actors walking in the\r\nsecret chamber below would seem as though they were figures appearing in\r\nthe water itself.\r\n\r\nIn view of the severe and general condemnation of magical practices found\r\nthroughout Holy Writ it is remarkable that the Pentateuchal narrative\r\ndoes not censure Joseph’s hydromantic arts. Indeed, except in the book\r\nGenesis, it is seldom that any forms of presaging or the use of charms\r\nare noted save with stern reprobation. In Isaias iii. 2, however,\r\nthe Kōsēm, magician or diviner, is mentioned with singular respect.\r\n“Ecce enim dominator Dominus exercituum auferet a Jerusalem et a Juda\r\nualidum et fortem omne robur panis et omne robur aquæ, fortem, et uirum\r\nbellatorem, iudicem, et prophetam, et _hariolum_, et senem.” Here the\r\nAuthorized Version deliberately mistranslates and obscures the sense:\r\n“For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem\r\nand from Judah, the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread and the\r\nwhole stay of water, the mighty man and the man of war, the judge and\r\nthe prophet, and _the prudent_, and the ancient.” “The Prudent” is by no\r\nmeans a rendering of Kōsēm which “hariolus” perfectly represents.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth chapter of Genesis we have a most detailed and striking\r\nnarrative of sympathetic magic. Jacob, who is serving Laban, is to\r\nreceive as a portion of his hire all the speckled and spotted cattle,\r\nall the brown among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the\r\ngoats. But the crafty old Syrian prevented his son-in-law by removing\r\nto a distance, a journey of three days, all such herds as had been\r\nspecified, “and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks. Thereupon Jacob\r\ntook rods of green poplar, hazel, and chestnut, and peeled these rods in\r\nalternate stripes of white and bark, and he put them in the gutters in\r\nthe watering-troughs when the flocks came to drink.” The animals duly\r\ncopulated, and “the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth\r\ncattle, ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.” Moreover, it was only when\r\nthe stronger cattle conceived that Jacob set the rods before their eyes,\r\nso that eventually all the best of the herds fell to his share. The\r\nnames of the trees are in themselves significant. The poplar in Roman\r\nfolklore was sacred to Hercules,[31] and as it grew on the banks of\r\nthe river Acheron in Epirus it was connected with Acheron, the waters\r\nof woe in the underworld, a confused tradition which is undoubtedly of\r\nvery early origin. So Pausanias has: τὴν λευκην ὁ Ἡρακλῆς πεφυκυῖαν παρὰ\r\nτὸν Ἀχέροντα εὔρετο ἐν Θεσπρωτιᾳ ποταμόν· In seventeenth-century England\r\npoplar-leaves were accounted an important ingredient in hell-broths and\r\ncharms. The hazel has been linked with magic from remotest antiquity,\r\nand the very name witch-hazel remains to-day. The chestnut-tree and its\r\nnuts seem to have been associated with some primitive sexual rites. The\r\nconnexion is obscure, but beyond doubt traceable. In that most glorious\r\nmarriage song, the Epithalamium of Catullus, as the boys sang their\r\nFescennines of traditional obscenity nuts were scattered among the\r\ncrowd.[32] Petronius (Fragmentum XXXIII, ed. Buecheler, Berolini, 1895)\r\nmentions chestnuts as an amatory gift:\r\n\r\n    aurea mala mihi, dulcis mea Marcia, mittis\r\n      mittis et hirsutae munera castaneae.\r\n\r\nIn Genesis again is recorded a most interesting and instructive example\r\nof the belief in the magic efficacy of plants. “And Reuben went in the\r\ndays of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them\r\nto his mother Leah” (xxx. 14 A.V.). Reuben brings his mother mandrakes\r\n(Love Apples), which Rachel desires to have. Whereupon Leah bargains\r\nwith Rachel, and the latter for a portion of the fruit consents that\r\nJacob shall that night return to the bed of his elder wife, who indeed\r\nconceives and in due time she bare Issachar. Leah ate of the mandrake as\r\na charm to induce pregnancy, and no disapproval of such use is expressed.\r\n\r\nA similar theme is treated in Machiavelli’s famous masterpiece of\r\nsatirical comedy _La Mandragola_,[33] written between 1513 and 1520,\r\nand performed by request before Leo X in the April of the latter year.\r\nIt had already been acted in Florence. In this play Callimaco is bent\r\nupon securing as his mistress Lucrezia, the wife of a gullable doctor of\r\nlaws, Messer Nicia, whose one wish in life is to get a son. Callimaco is\r\nintroduced as a physician to Nicia, to whom he explains that a potion\r\nof mandragora administered to the lady will remove her sterility, but\r\nthat it has fatal consequences to the husband. He must perish unless\r\nsome other man be first substituted whose action will absorb the poison,\r\nand leave Lucrezia free to become the mother of a blooming family. This\r\nplot is fully worked out, and by the services of his supple confederates\r\nCallimaco is introduced to Lucrezia’s bedchamber as the necessary victim,\r\nand gains his desire.\r\n\r\nMandrakes and mallows were potent in all forms of enchantment, and about\r\nthe mandrake in particular has grown up a whole library of legend, which\r\nit would require much time and space thoroughly to investigate. Western\r\nlore is mainly of somewhat a grim character, but not entirely, and by the\r\nOrientals mandrake is regarded as a powerful aphrodisiac. So in Canticles\r\nVII, 13, we have: Mandragoræ dederunt odorem. (The mandrakes give a\r\nfragrant smell.) In antiquity mandrakes were used as an anæsthetic.\r\nDioscorides alludes to the employment of this herb before patients have\r\nto be cut or burned; Pliny refers to its odour as causing sleep during\r\nan operation; Lucian speaks of it as used before cautery; and both Galen\r\nand Isidorus have passages which mention its dormitive quality. The\r\nShakespearean allusions have rendered this aspect familiar to all.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs and ancient Germans thought that a powerful spirit inhabited\r\nthe plant, an idea derived, perhaps, from the fancied resemblance\r\nof the root to the human form. Ducagne has under Mandragore: “Pomi\r\ngenus cuius mentio fit, Gen. xxx. 14. nostris etiam notis sub nomine\r\n_Mandragores_, quod pectore asseruatum sibi diuitiis acquirendis idoneum\r\nsomniabunt.” And Littré quotes the following from an old chronicle of\r\nthe thirteenth century: “Li dui compaignon [un couple d’éléphants] vont\r\ncontre Orient près du paradis terreste, tant que la femelle trouve une\r\nherbe que on apele mandragore, si en manjue, et si atize tant son masle\r\nqu’il en manjue avec li, et maintenant eschaufe la volenté de chascun,\r\net s’entrejoignent à envers et engendrent un filz sanz plus.” In the\r\n_Commentaria ad Historiam Caroli VI et VII_ it is related that several\r\nmandrakes found in the possession of Frère Richard, a Cordelier, were\r\nseized and burned as savouring of witchcraft.\r\n\r\nIt seems certain that the teraphim, which Rachel stole from her father\r\n(Genesis xxxi, 19, and 31-35), and which when he was in pursuit she\r\nconcealed by a subtle trick, were used for purposes of divination. From\r\nthe relation of the incident it is obvious that they were regarded of\r\nimmense value—he who had conveyed them away was, if found, to die the\r\ndeath—and invested with a mysterious sanctity. Centuries later, during\r\nthe period of drastic reform, King Josias (639-608 B.C.) would no longer\r\ntolerate them: “Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the\r\nwizards, and the images [teraphim], and the idols, and all abominations\r\nthat were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem did Josiah put\r\naway” (2 Kings xxiii. 24. A.V.). The Vulgate has: “Sed et pythones,\r\net hariolos, et figuras idolorum, et immunditias, et abominationes,\r\nquæ fuerant in terra Juda et Jerusalem, abstulit Josias.” In Ezechiel\r\nxxi. 21, Esarhaddon is said to have divined by teraphim as well as by\r\nbelomancy; and in Zacharias (x. 2) the teraphim are stated on occasion\r\nto have deceived their inquirers, “simulacra locuta sunt inutile,” “the\r\nidols have spoken vanity.” Notwithstanding this it is obvious from Osee\r\n(Hosea) iii. 4, that divination by teraphim was sometimes permitted:\r\n“Dies multos sedebunt filii Israel sine rege, et sine principe, et sine\r\nsacrificio, et sine altari, et sine ephod, et sine teraphim.” “The\r\nchildren of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a\r\nprince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an\r\nephod, and without teraphim.”\r\n\r\nThe learned Cornelius à Lapide glossing on Genesis xxxi writes: “Idola,\r\n_teraphim_ quod significat statuæ humanæ siue humaneas formas habentes\r\nut patet, I. Reg. xix.” The allusion is to the deception practised by\r\nMichal on Saul’s messengers, when putting one of the teraphim in bed\r\nand covering it with quilts she pretended it was David who lay sick.\r\n“Secundo,” continues à Lapide, “nomen _theraphim_ non appropriatum est in\r\neas statuas, quæ opera dæmonorum deposci debent, ut patet Judicum, xviii,\r\n18,” the reference being to the history of Micas. Calvin very absurdly\r\nsays: “Theraphim sunt imagines quales habent papistæ.”\r\n\r\nSpencer[34] is of opinion that these teraphim were small images or\r\nfigures, and the point seems conclusively settled by S. Jerome, who in\r\nhis twenty-ninth Epistle, _De Ephod et Teraphim_, quotes 1 Kings xix.\r\n15, and uses “figuras siue figurationes” to translate μορφώματα of\r\nAquila of Pontus. This writer was the author of a Greek version of the\r\nOld Testament published _circa_ A.D. 128. About eight years before he\r\nseems to have been expelled from the Christian community, by whom he was\r\nregarded as an adept in magic. The work of Aquila, who studied in the\r\nschool of Rabbi Akiba, the founder of Rabbinical Judaism, is said by S.\r\nJerome to have attained such exactitude that it was a good dictionary to\r\nfurnish the meaning of the obscurer Hebrew words. The Targum of Jonathan\r\ncommenting upon Genesis xxxi. 19, puts forward the singular view that the\r\nteraphim, concealed by Rachel, consisted of a mummified human head.\r\n\r\nIn the book Tobias we have a detailed and important account of exorcism,\r\nand one, moreover, which throws considerable light upon the demonology of\r\nthe time. Tobias, the son of Tobias, is sent under the guidance of the\r\nunknown Angel, S. Raphael, to Gabelus in Rages of Media, to obtain the\r\nten talents of silver left in bond by his father. Tobias, whilst bathing\r\nin the Tigris is attacked by a monstrous fish, of which he is told by his\r\nAngel protector to reserve the heart, liver, and gall; the first two of\r\nthese are to prevent the devil who had slain seven previous husbands of\r\nSara, the beautiful daughter of Raguel, from attacking him. They arrive\r\nat the house of Raguel, and Tobias seeks the hand of Sara. She, however,\r\nis so beloved by the demon Asmodeus that seven men who had in turn\r\nmarried her were by him put to death the night of the nuptials, before\r\nconsummation. Tobias, however, by exorcism, by the odour of the burning\r\nliver of the fish, and by the help of S. Raphael, routs Asmodeus, “Then\r\nthe Angel Raphael took the Devil, and bound him in the desert of upper\r\nEgypt.” The story which must be accepted as fact-narrative was originally\r\nwritten during the Babylonian exile in the early portion of the seventh\r\ncentury, B.C. It plainly shows that demons were considered to be capable\r\nof sexual love, such as was the love of the sons of God for the daughters\r\nof men recorded in Genesis (vi. 2). One may compare the stories of the\r\nJinns in Arabian lore. Asmodeus is perhaps to be identified with the\r\nPersian _Aëshma daêva_, who in the _Avesta_ is next to Angromainyus, the\r\nchief of the evil spirits. The introduction of Tobias’s dog should be\r\nremarked. The dog accompanies his master on the journey and when they\r\nreturn home “the dog, which had been with them in the way, ran before,\r\nand coming as if he had brought the news, shewed his joy by his fawning\r\nand wagging his tail.” Among the Persians a certain power over evil\r\nspirits was justly assigned to the faithful dog.\r\n\r\nThe New Testament evidence for the reality of magic and divination\r\nis such that cannot be disregarded by any who accept the Christian\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\nIn the Gospels we continually meet with possession by devils; the miracle\r\nwrought in the country of the Gerasenes (Gergesenes) (S. Matthew viii.\r\n28-34), the dumb man possessed by a devil (S. Matthew ix. 32-34), the\r\nhealing of the lunatic boy who was obsessed (S. Matthew xvii. 14-21), the\r\nexorcism of the unclean spirit (S. Mark i. 23-27), the casting out of\r\ndevils whom Christ suffered not to speak (S. Mark i. 32-34), the exorcism\r\nin the name of Jesus (S. Mark ix. 38), the demons who fled our Lord’s\r\npresence crying out “Thou art Christ, the son of God” (S. Luke iv. 41),\r\nthe healing of those vexed with unclean spirits (S. Luke vi. 18), and\r\nmany instances more.\r\n\r\nVery early in the Apostolic ministry appears one of the most famous\r\nfigures in the whole history of Witchcraft, Simon, who is as Simon\r\nMagus, sorcerer and heresiarch. At the outbreak of that persecution\r\n(_circa_ A.D. 37) of the Christian community in Jerusalem which began\r\nwith the martyrdom of S. Stephen, when Philip the Deacon went down to\r\nSamaria, Simon, a native of Gitta, was living in that city. By his magic\r\narts and by his mysterious doctrine, in which he announced himself as\r\n“the great power of God,” he had made a name for himself and gained\r\nmany adherents. He listened to Philip’s sermons, was greatly impressed\r\nby them, he saw with wonder the miracles of healing and the exorcisms\r\nof unclean spirits, and like many of his countrymen was baptized and\r\nunited with the community of believers in Christ. But it is obvious that\r\nhe only took this step in order to gain, as he hoped, greater magical\r\npower and thus increase his influence. For when the Apostles S. Peter\r\nand S. John came to Samaria to bestow upon those who had been baptized\r\nby Philip the outpouring of the Holy Ghost which was accompanied by\r\nheavenly manifestations Simon offered them money, saying, “Give me also\r\nthis power,” which he obviously regarded as a charm or occult spell. S.\r\nPeter forthwith sharply rebuked the unholy neophyte, who, alarmed at this\r\ndenunciation, implored the Apostles to pray for him.\r\n\r\nSimon is not mentioned again in the New Testament, but the first\r\nChristian writers have much to say concerning him. S. Justin Martyr,\r\nin his first _Apologia_ (A.D. 153-155) and in his dialogue _Contra\r\nTryphonem_ (before A.D. 161), describes Simon as a warlock who at the\r\ninstigation of demons claimed to be a god. During the reign of the\r\nEmperor Claudius, Simon came to Rome, and by his sorceries won many\r\nfollowers who paid him divine honours. He was accompanied by a lewd\r\nconcubine from Tyre, Helena, whom he claimed was Heavenly Intelligence,\r\nset free from bondage by himself the “great power.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Pseudo-Clementine Homilies_ (probably second century) Simon\r\nappears as the chief antagonist of S. Peter, by whom his devilish\r\npractices are exposed and his enchantments dissolved. The apocryphal\r\n_Acts of S. Peter_, which are of high antiquity,[35] give in detail the\r\nwell-known legend of the death of Simon Magus. By his spells the warlock\r\nhad almost won the Emperor Nero to himself, but continually he was being\r\nfoiled and thwarted owing to the intercession of the Apostle. At last\r\nwhen Cæsar demanded one final proof of the truth of his doctrines, some\r\nmiracle that might be performed at midday in the face of all Rome, Simon\r\noffered to take his flight into the heavens—a diabolical parody of the\r\nAscension—so that men might know his power was full as mighty as that of\r\nHim whom the Christians worshipped as God.\r\n\r\nA mighty concourse gathered in the Forum: Vestal Virgins, Senators,\r\nEquites, their ladies, and a whole rabble of lesser folk. In the\r\nforefront of a new Imperial box sat the Lord Nero Claudius Cæsar Augustus\r\nGermanicus, on one side his mother, Agrippina, on the other Octavia\r\nhis wife. Magic staff in hand the magician advanced into the midst of\r\nthe arena: muttering a spell he bade his staff await his return, and\r\nforthwith it stood upright, alone, upon the pavement. Then with a deep\r\nobeisance to the ruler of the known world Simon Magus stretched forth\r\nhis arms, and a moment more with rigid limbs and stern set face he rose\r\nfrom the ground and began to float high in air toward the Capitol. Like\r\nsome monstrous bird he rose, and hovered fluttering in space awhile. But\r\namong the throng stood S. Peter, and just as the sorcerer had reached\r\nthe topmost pinnacles of the shrine of Juno Moneta, now Santa Maria in\r\nAracœli, where brown Franciscans sing the praises of God, the first Pope\r\nof Rome kneeled down, lifted his right hand and deliberately made a\r\nmighty Sign of the Cross towards the figure who usurped the privileges\r\nof the Incarnate Son of Mary. Who shall say what hosts of hells fled at\r\nthat moment? The wizard dropped swift as heavy lead; the body whirled\r\nand turned in the air; it crashed, broken and breathless, at the foot of\r\nthe Emperor’s seat, which was fouled and bespattered with black gouts\r\nof blood. At the same moment with a ringing sound the staff fell prone\r\non the pavement. The flag upon which S. Peter kneeled may be seen even\r\nuntil this day in the Church of Santa Francesca Romana. For, in order to\r\ncommemorate the defeat of the warlock, Pope S. Paul I (757-767) built\r\na church upon the site of his discomfiture, and in 850 Pope S. Leo IV\r\nreconstructed it as Santa Maria Nova, which gave place to the present\r\nfane dedicated in 1612.\r\n\r\nBut the fame of Simon Magus as a wizard has been swallowed up in his\r\nill repute as a heretic; so early do heresy and magic go hand in hand.\r\nHe was the first Gnostic, whose disciples the Simonians, an Antinomian\r\nsect of the second century, indulged the sickest fantasies. Menander,\r\nthe successor of Simon, proclaimed himself the Messiah and asserted that\r\nby his baptism immortality was conferred upon his followers. He also was\r\nregarded as a mighty magician, and the sect which was named after him,\r\nthe Menandrians, seems to have lasted for no inconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nIn his missionary journeys S. Paul was continually combating Witchcraft.\r\nAt Paphos he was opposed by the sorcerer Elymas; in Philippi a medium,\r\n“a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination,” “spiritum\r\npythonem,” followed him along the streets crying out and naming him\r\nas “a servant of the most high God,” until he exorcized the spirit;\r\nat Ephesus, a hotbed of sorcery and superstition, he converted many\r\ndiviners and witches, who cleansed their souls by the Sacrament of\r\nPenance, and burned their conjuring books, a library of no mean value.\r\nIt amounted indeed to fifty thousand drachmas (£2000), and one may\r\nsuppose that in addition to manuscripts there were amulets of silver and\r\ngold, richly wrought and jewelled. In Ephesus, also, had foregathered a\r\nlarge number of vagabond Jews, exorcists. The chief characteristic of a\r\nJewish exorcism was the recitation of names believed to be efficacious,\r\nprincipally names of good angels, which were used either alone, or\r\nin combination with El (God); and, indeed, a blind reliance upon the\r\nsound of mere names had long been a settled practice with these amateur\r\nsorcerers, who considered that the essence of their charms lay in the\r\nuse of particular names declaimed in a particular order, which differed\r\non several occasions. It was this belief, no doubt, that induced the\r\nseven sons of Sceva, who had witnessed S. Paul’s exorcisms in the name\r\nof Jesus, to try upon their own account the formula “I conjure thee by\r\nJesus whom Paul preacheth,” an experiment disastrous to their credit.\r\nFor in one case the patient cried out “Jesus I know, and Paul I know,\r\nbut who are ye?” and leaped upon them with infernal strength, beating\r\nand wounding them, so that they fled for safety from the house, their\r\nlimbs bruised and their garments torn, to the great scandal of the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFor the fact of demoniac possession the authority of Christ Himself is\r\nplainly pledged; whilst Witchcraft is explicitly ranked by S. Paul with\r\nmurder, sedition, hatred, and heresy (Galatians v. 20-21). S. John,\r\nalso, twice mentions sorcerers in a hideous catalogue of sinners. There\r\ncan be no doubt whatsoever that the reality of Witchcraft is definitely\r\nmaintained by the New Testament writers,[36] and any denial of this\r\nimplicitly involves a rejection of the truth of the Christian revelation.\r\n\r\nAmong the Jews of a later period, and probably even to-day, various\r\ndiseases are said to be induced by demons, who, it is instructive to\r\nnotice, haunt marshy places, damp and decayed houses, latrines, squalid\r\nalleys, foul atmospheres where sickness is bred and ripened.\r\n\r\nJosephus (_ob._ A.D. 100) relates that God taught Solomon how demons were\r\nto be expelled, a “science useful and sanitative to men.” He also gives\r\nan account of Eliezar, a celebrated exorcist of the time, whom, in the\r\npresence of the Emperor Vespasian, the historian actually saw casting\r\nout evil spirits. The operator applied to the nose of the possessed\r\na ring having attached to it a root which Solomon is said to have\r\nprescribed—“Baaras,” a herb of magical properties, and one dangerous for\r\nthe uninitiate to handle. As the devils came forth Eliezar caused them\r\nto pass into a basin filled with water, which was at once poured away.\r\nIt may be noticed also that demonology plays an important part in the\r\nBook of Enoch (before 170 B.C.). Even in the Mishna there are undoubted\r\ntraces of magic, and in the Gemara demonology and sorcery loom very\r\nlargely. Throughout the Middle Ages Jewish legend played no insignificant\r\npart in the history of Witchcraft, and, especially in Spain, until the\r\nnineteenth century at least, there were prosecutions, not so much for\r\nthe observance of Hebrew ceremonies as is often suggested and supposed,\r\nbut for the practice of the dark and hideous traditions of Hebrew magic.\r\nClosely connected with these ancient sorceries are those ritual murders,\r\nof which a learned Premonstratensian Canon of Wilthin, Adrian Kembter,\r\nwriting in 1745, was able to enumerate no less than two-and-fifty,[37]\r\nthe latest of these having taken place in 1650, when at Cadan in Bohemia,\r\nMatthias, a lad of four years old, was killed by certain rabbis with\r\nseven wounds. In many cases the evidence is quite conclusive that the\r\nbody, and especially the blood of the victim, was used for magical\r\npurposes. Thus with reference to little S. Hugh of Lincoln, after various\r\nvery striking details, the chronicler has: “Et cum exspirasset puer,\r\ndeposuerunt corpus de cruce, et nescitur qua ratione, euiscerarunt\r\ncorpusculum; dicitur autem, quod ad magicas artes exercendas.” In 1261\r\nat Forcheim in Bavaria the blood of a murdered boy was used to sprinkle\r\ncertain thresholds and doors. In 1285 at Munich a witch was convicted of\r\nselling Christian children to the Jews, who carefully preserved the blood\r\nin curious vessels for secret rites. In 1494 at Tyrnau twelve vampires\r\nwere executed for having opened the veins of a boy whom they had snared,\r\nand having drunk his warm blood thence whilst he was yet alive. A deed\r\nof peculiar horror was discovered at Szydlow in 1597 when the victim was\r\nput to death in exquisite tortures, the blood and several members of the\r\nbody being partaken of by the murderers. In almost every case the blood\r\nwas carefully collected, there can be no doubt for magical purposes, the\r\nunderlying idea being the precept of the Mosaic law: Anima enim omnis\r\ncarnis in sanguine est:[38] For the life of all flesh is in the blood\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n[1] _Khartummim._ The same word is used to describe the magicians whom\r\nPharaoh summoned to interpret his dream, _Genesis_ xli. 8, where the\r\nVulgate has _coniectores_. _Exodus_ viii. 11, the Vulgate reads: “Uocauit\r\nautem Pharao sapientes et maleficos.”\r\n\r\n[2] It is perhaps worth mentioning that even the most modernistic\r\ncommentators assign the history of Balaam to the oldest document of the\r\nHexateuch, that they call the Jehovistic.\r\n\r\n[3] In his commentary on the ninth chapter of the prophet Osee (Hosea),\r\nS. Jerome says: “Ingressi [sunt] ad Beel-Phegor, idolum Moabitarum\r\nquem nos PRIAPUM possumus appelare.” And Rufinus on the same prophet\r\nhas: “Beel-Phegor figuram Priapi dixerunt tenere.” (They entered in\r\nunto Beel-Phegor, the idol of the Moabites, whom we may identify with\r\nPRIAPUS.... Beel-Phegor is said to have had the same shape as Priapus.)\r\n\r\n[4] Balaam hariolus a Domino mittitur ut decipiat Balac filium Beor. _In\r\nEzechielem_, IV. xiv. Migne, _Patres Latini_, XXV. p. 118. (Baalam, a\r\nsoothsayer, is sent by God to deceive Balac, son of Beor.)\r\n\r\n[5] Balaam fuisse prophetam non Dei, sed diaboli constat....

In truth he who accepts the spiritual\r\nworld is bound to realize all about him the age-long struggle for empery\r\nof discarnate evil ceaselessly contending with a thousand cunning\r\nsleights and a myriad vizardings against the eternal unconquerable powers\r\nof good. Nature herself bears witness to the contest; disease and death,\r\ncruelty and pain, ugliness and sin, are all evidences of the mighty\r\nwarfare, and it would be surprising indeed if some were not wounded in\r\nthe fray—for we cannot stand apart, each man, S. Ignatius says, must\r\nfight under one of the two standards—if some even did not fall.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians, whose religion of boundless antiquity is\r\npre-eminent in the old world for its passionate earnestness, its purity,\r\nand lofty idealism certainly held that some diseases were due to the\r\naction of evil spirits or demons, who in exceptional circumstances had\r\nthe power of entering human bodies and of vexing them in proportion to\r\nthe opportunities consciously or unconsciously given to their malign\r\nnatures and influences. Moreover, the Egyptians were regarded as being\r\nsupremely gifted in the art of curing the diseases caused by demoniacal\r\npossession, and one noteworthy instance of this was inscribed upon a\r\nstele and set up in the temple of the god Khonsu at Thebes so that all\r\nmen might learn his might and his glory.[1] When King Rameses II was in\r\nMesopotamia the various princes made him many offerings of gold and gems,\r\nand amongst other came the Prince of Bekhten, who brought his daughter,\r\nthe fairest maiden of that land. When the king saw he loved her and\r\nbestowed upon her the title of “Royal spouse, chief lady, Rā-neferu”\r\n(the beauties of Ra, the Sun-god), and taking her back to Egypt he\r\nmarried her with great pomp and hallowed solemnity. In the fifteenth\r\nyear of the king’s reign there arrived at his court an ambassador from\r\nthe Prince of Bekhten, bearing rich presents and beseeching him “on\r\nbehalf of the lady Bent-ent-resht, the younger sister of the royal\r\nspouse Rā-neferu, for, behold, an evil disease hath laid hold upon her\r\nbody,” “wherefore,” said the envoy, “I beseech thy Majesty to send a\r\nphysician[2] to see her.” Rameses ordered the books of the “double house\r\nof life” to be brought and the wise men to choose from their number one\r\nwho might be sent to Bekhten. They selected the sage Tehuti-em-heb, who\r\nin company with the ambassador forthwith departed on their journey,\r\nand when they had arrived the Egyptian priest soon found the lady\r\nBent-ent-resht was possessed of a demon or spirit over which he was\r\npowerless. Wellnigh in despair the Prince of Bekhten sent again to the\r\nking begging him to dispatch even a god to his help.\r\n\r\nWhen the ambassador arrived a second time Rameses was worshipping in the\r\ntemple of Khonsu Nefer-hetep at Thebes, and he at once besought that\r\ndeity to allow his counterpart Khonsu to go to Bekhten and to deliver\r\nthe daughter of the prince of that country from the demon who possessed\r\nher. Khonsu Nefer-hetep granted the request, and a fourfold measure of\r\nmagical power was imparted to the statue of the god which was to go to\r\nBekhten. The god, seated in his boat, and five other boats with figures\r\nof gods in them, accompanied by a noble attendance of horses and chariots\r\nupon the right and the left, set out for Bekhten, where in due course\r\nthey were received with great honour. The god Khonsu was brought to the\r\nplace where the princess was, magical ceremonies were performed, and the\r\ndemon incontinently departed. Khonsu remained in Bekhten three years,\r\nfour months, and five days, being worshipped with the utmost veneration.\r\nOne night, however, the Prince had a dream in which he saw a hawk of\r\ngold issue from the sacred shrine and wing its way towards Egypt. In\r\nthe morning the Egyptian priests interpreted his dream as meaning that\r\nthe god now wished to return, and accordingly he was escorted back in\r\nsuperb state, and with him were sent grateful gifts and thank offerings\r\ninnumerable to be laid in the temple of Khonsu Nefer-hetep at Thebes.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks of the earlier civilization were inclined generally to\r\nattribute all sickness to the gods, who again often by this particular\r\nmeans took almost immediate revenge upon those who had insulted their\r\nimages, profaned their sanctuaries, or derided their worship. Thus\r\nPentheus who resists the introduction of the mysteries of Dionysus\r\ninto Thebes is driven mad by the affronted deity.[3] The madness of\r\nAjax, and that of the daughters of Proetus,[4] who imagined themselves\r\nchanged into cows, shows us that this belief went back to heroic times.\r\nIn later days Demaratus and his brother Alopecos were driven lunatic\r\n(παραφρονήσαν) after having found the statue of Artemis Orthosia, and\r\nthis was considered to be the power of the goddess.[5] The frenzy which\r\nattacked Quintus Fulvius was regarded as a punishment, a possession by\r\nevil spirits on account of his sacrilege in having stolen the marble roof\r\nof the temple of Juno Lacinia at Locri.[6]\r\n\r\nPythagoras taught that the ailments both of men and of animals are due\r\nto demons who throng the regions of the air, and this doctrine does no\r\nmore than state clearly what had been more or less vaguely believed from\r\nthe dawn of human history. Wherefore Homer in the _Odyssey_, speaking\r\nof a man who is racked by a sore disease, says that a hateful demon is\r\ntormenting him: στυγερὸς δέ οἱ ἔχραε δαίμων, V, 396. (But a hateful demon\r\ngriped him fast.) The word κακοδαιμονία, possession by an evil spirit, in\r\nAristophanes signifies “raving madness,” and the verb κακοδαιμονάω, to be\r\ntormented by an evil spirit, is used by Xenophon, Demosthenes, Dinarchus,\r\nand Plutarch[7] amongst other authors.\r\n\r\nMany philosophers believed that each man has a protecting daimon, who in\r\nsome sense personifies his individuality. It followed that lunatics and\r\nthe delirious were afflicted with madness by these spirits who guided\r\nthem, and accordingly the Greek names for those distraught are highly\r\nsignificant: ἐνεργούμενοι (in later Greek, persons possessed of an evil\r\nspirit), δαιμονιόληπτοι (influenced by devils), θεόληπτοι, θεόβλαβες\r\n(stricken of God), θεόμανες (maddened by the gods); and so Euripides has\r\nλύσσα θεομανής, and again θεομανης πότμος.[8] The very name μανία given\r\nby the Greeks to madness was derived from the root-word _man, men_,[9]\r\nwhich occurs in the Latin _Manes_, and indeed the Romans thought that\r\na madman was tormented by the goddess Mania, the mother of the Lares,\r\nthe hallucinations of lunatics being taken to be spectres who pursued\r\nthem.[10] And so a madman was _laruarum plenus_, _laruatus_,[11] one whom\r\nphantoms disturbed; as in Plautus, where the doctor says: “What kind of\r\na disease is this? Explain. Unfold, old sire, I say. Art thou crazed\r\n(_laruatus_) or lunatic? Tell me now.”[12]\r\n\r\nThe frantic exaltation which thrilled the Galli, and the Corybantes\r\nwhen they celebrated the Dionysia, seems to have been epidemic, and was\r\nuniversally attributed to divine possession. There are many allusions to\r\nthe connexion between the rites of Cybele and Dionysus. Apollodorus[13]\r\nsays Dionysus was purified from madness by Rhea at the Phrygian Cybela,\r\nand was then initiated into her rites and took her dress; thence he\r\npassed into Thrace with a train of Bacchanals and Satyrs. Strabo,[14] on\r\nthe other hand, thinks the rites were brought from Thrace by colonists\r\nfrom that country into Phrygia; he even quotes a fragment from the\r\n_Edoni_ of Æschylus[15] as proving the identity of the cultus of Dionysus\r\nand Cybele. So also we have in Euripides, _Bacchæ_, 58,\r\n\r\n              Up, and wake the sweet old sound,\r\n    The clang that I and mystic Rhea found,\r\n    The Timbrel of the Mountains.[16]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to remark that Nicander of Claros,[17] who was\r\na physician, in his _Alexipharmaca_ (Ἀλεξιφάρμακα), speaking of a\r\nparticular form of lunacy, compares the shrieks uttered by patients with\r\nthose of a priestess of Rhea, when on the ninth day she makes all whom\r\nshe encounters in the streets tremble at the hideous howl of the Idæan\r\nMother; κερνοφόρος ζάκορος βωμίστρια Ῥείης is the exact phrase.[18]\r\n\r\nIn the _Hippolytus_ (141 _sqq._) the Chorus speaking to Phædra says:\r\n\r\n    Is this some spirit, O child of man?\r\n    Doth Hecat hold thee perchance, or Pan?\r\n    Doth She of the Mountains work her ban,\r\n        Or the Dread Corybantes bind thee?[19]\r\n\r\nAnd in the _Medea_ (1171-2) we have: “She seemed, I wot, to be one\r\nfrenzied, inspired with madness by Pan or some other of the gods.”[20]\r\n\r\nHere τινὸς θεῶν, says Paley, alludes to Dionysus or Cybele. Madness was\r\nsometimes thought to be sent by Pan for any neglect of his worship, so in\r\nthe _Rhesus_ Hector cries (36-7): “Can it be that you are scared by the\r\nfear-causing stroke of Pan of old Kronos’s line?”[21]\r\n\r\nAretæus, the medical writer, who is especially celebrated for his\r\naccuracy of diagnosis, in his _De signis chronicorum morborum_, VI,\r\ndescribes Corybantic frenzy as a mental malady and says that patients\r\nmay be soothed and even cured by the strains of soft music.[22] We have\r\nhere then the same remedy as was applied in the case of Saul, whom, we\r\nare told, “an evil spirit from the Lord troubled,”[23] and to whose court\r\nDavid, the sweet harper, was summoned. This seems to be the only instance\r\nof demoniac possession in the Old Testament and although the Hebrew word\r\n_rûah_ need not absolutely imply a personal influence, if we may judge\r\nfrom Josephus[24] the Jews certainly gave the word that meaning in this\r\nvery passage.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here clearly to explain the difference between possession\r\nand obsession, two technical terms sometimes confounded. By obsession\r\nis meant that the demon attacks a man’s body from without;[25] by\r\npossession is meant that he assumes control of it from within. Thus S.\r\nJerome describes the obsessions which beset S. Hilarion: “Many were\r\nhis temptations; day and night did the demons change and renew their\r\nsnares.... As he lay down how often did not nude women encircle him?\r\nWhen he was an hungered how often a plenteous board was spread before\r\nhim?”[26] S. Antony the Great, also was similarly attacked: “The devil\r\ndid not let to attack him, at night assuming the form of some maiden\r\nand imitating a woman’s gestures to deceive Antony.”[27] These painful\r\nphenomena are not uncommon in the lives of the Saints. Very many\r\nexamples might be cited, but one will suffice, that of S. Margaret of\r\nCortona,[28] the Franciscan penitent,[29] who was long and terribly\r\ntormented: “Following her to and fro up and down her humble cell as\r\nshe wept and prayed [the devil] sang the most filthy songs, and lewdly\r\nincited Christ’s dear handmaid, who with tears was commending herself to\r\nthe Lord, to join him in trolling forth bawdy catches ... but her prayers\r\nand tears finally routed the foul spirit and drove him far away.”[30]\r\nThe theologians, however, warn us to be very cautious in dealing\r\nwith so difficult a matter, and the supreme authority of S. Alphonsus\r\nLiguori advises us that by far the greater part of these obsessions are\r\ndistressing hallucinations, neurasthenia, imagination, hysteria, in a\r\nword, pathological: “It is advisable always to be very suspicious of\r\nsuch diabolic attacks, for it cannot be gainsaid that for the most part\r\nthey are fancy, or the effect of imagination, or weakness, especially\r\nwhen women are concerned.”[31] Dom Dominic Schram presses home the same\r\npoint with equal emphasis: “Very often what are supposed to be demoniacal\r\nobsessions are nothing else than natural ailments, or morbid imaginings,\r\nor even distractions or actual lunacy. Wherefore it is necessary to deal\r\nwith these cases most carefully, until the peculiar symptoms clearly show\r\nthat it is actual obsession.”[32]\r\n\r\nDemoniac possession is frequently presented to us in the New Testament,\r\nand we have the authority of Christ Himself as to its reality. The\r\ninfidel argument is to deny the possibility of possession in any\r\ncircumstances, either on the hypothesis that there are no evil spirits\r\nin existence, or that they are powerless to influence the human body\r\nin the manner described. But whatever view Rationalists may adopt—and\r\nthey are continually shifting their ground—no reader of the Scriptural\r\nnarrative can deny that Christ by word and deed showed His entire belief\r\nin possession by evil spirits. And if Christ were divine how came He to\r\nfoster and encourage a delusion? Why did He not correct it? Only two\r\nanswers can be supposed. Either He was ignorant of a religious truth, or\r\nHe deliberately gave instructions that He knew to be false, frequently\r\nacting in a way which was something more than misleading. To a Christian\r\neither of these explanations is, of course, unthinkable. The theory of\r\naccommodation formulated by Winer[33] may be accepted by Modernists, but\r\nwill be instantly condemned by all others. Accommodation is understood\r\nas the toleration of harmless illusions of the day having little or\r\nno connexion with religion. Even if this fine piece of profanity were\r\nallowed, which, of course, must not be the case, the argument could not\r\nbe applied here, indeed it seems wholly repugnant even in regard to a\r\nSaint, but entirely impossible in consideration of the divinity of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe victims of possession were sometimes deprived of speech and sight:\r\n“Then was offered to him one possessed of a devil, blind and dumb: and\r\nhe healed him, so that he spoke and saw” (S. Matthew xii. 22). Sometimes\r\nthey had lost speech alone: “Behold, they brought him a dumb man,\r\npossessed with a devil, and after the devil was cast out the dumb man\r\nspoke” (S. Matthew ix. 32, 33); also “And he was casting out a devil, and\r\nthe same was dumb: and when he had cast out the devil the dumb spoke”\r\n(S. Luke xi. 14). In many cases the mere fact of possession is mentioned\r\nwithout further details: “they presented to him such as were possessed\r\nby devils, and lunatics ... and he cured them” (S. Matthew iv. 24); “and\r\nwhen evening was come, they brought to him many that were possessed with\r\ndevils, and he cast out the spirits with his word” (S. Matthew viii. 16);\r\n“And, behold a woman of Canaan, who came out of those coasts, crying out,\r\nsaid to him: Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is\r\ngrievously troubled by a devil ... Then Jesus answering, said to her:\r\nO woman, great is thy faith: be it done to thee as thou wilt: and her\r\ndaughter was cured from that hour” (S. Matthew xv. 22-28); “And when\r\nit was evening after sunset they brought to him all that were ill and\r\nthat were possessed with devils”; “And he cast out many devils, and he\r\nsuffered them not to speak, because they knew him”; “And he was preaching\r\nin their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils” (S. Mark\r\ni. 32, 34, 39); “And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down\r\nbefore him: and they cried, saying: Thou art the Son of God” (S. Mark\r\niii. 11, 12); “And devils went out from many, crying out and saying: Thou\r\nart the Son of God” (S. Luke iv. 41); “And they that were troubled with\r\nunclean spirits were cured” (S. Luke vi. 18); “And in that same hour, he\r\ncured many of their diseases, and hurts, and evil spirits” (S. Luke vii.\r\n21). The exorcism of the man “who had a devil now a very long time,” and\r\nwho dwelt among the tombs in the country of the Gerasens (Gadarenes) is\r\nrelated by S. Luke (viii. 27-39). The possessed is tormented by so many\r\nunclean spirits that they proclaim their name as Legion: he is endowed\r\nwith supernatural strength so that he breaks asunder bonds and fetters:\r\nthe devils recognize Christ as God, and Our Lord converses with them,\r\nasking how they are called. Immediately the devils have been cast out the\r\nman is clothed, peaceable, reasonable, and quiet, “in his right mind.”\r\n\r\nAt the foot of Mount Tabor a young man is brought by his father to be\r\nhealed. The youth is possessed of a dumb spirit, “who, wheresoever he\r\ntaketh him dasheth him, and he foameth, and gnasheth with the teeth, and\r\npineth away.” When Jesus approached, “immediately the spirit troubled\r\nhim; and being thrown down upon the ground, he rolled about foaming.”\r\nThe patient had been thus afflicted “from his infancy, and oftentimes\r\nhath he cast him into the fire and into waters to destroy him.” Our\r\nLord threatened the spirit, and forthwith expelled it. (S. Mark ix.\r\n14-28.) It should be noticed that it is the demons who are addressed\r\non these occasions, not their victims. In the face of this catena of\r\nBiblical evidence and the various circumstances attending these exorcisms\r\nit is impossible to maintain that the possessed suffered merely from\r\nepilepsy, paralysis, acute mania, or any other such disease. In fact the\r\nEvangelists carefully separate natural maladies from diabolic possession:\r\n“He cast out the spirits with his word: and all that were sick he healed”\r\n(S. Matthew viii. 16); “They brought to him all that were ill and that\r\nwere possessed with devils ... and he healed many that were troubled with\r\ndivers diseases and he cast out many devils” (S. Mark i. 32, 34). In the\r\noriginal Greek the distinction is still more clearly and unmistakably\r\nshown: πάντας τοὺς κακῶς ἔχοντας καὶ τοὺς δαιμονιζομένους. Saint Matthew,\r\nagain, differentiates: “they presented to him all sick people that were\r\ntaken with divers diseases [ποικίλαις νόσοις] and torments [βασάνοις]\r\nand such as were possessed by devils [δαιμονιζομένους] and lunatics\r\n[σεληνιαζομένους] and those who had the palsy [παραλυτικούς] and he\r\ncured them,” iv. 24. Moreover, Our Lord expressly distinguishes between\r\npossession and natural disease; “Behold I cast out devils and do cures,”\r\nare the Divine Words; ἰδοὺ ἐκβάλλω δαιμόνια καὶ ἰάσεις ἀποτελῶ (S. Luke\r\nxiii. 32).\r\n\r\nThat the demoniacs were often afflicted with other diseases as well is\r\nhighly probable. The demons may have attacked those who were already\r\nsick, whilst the very fact of obsession or possession would of itself\r\nproduce disease as a natural consequence.\r\n\r\nAccording to S. Matthew x. 1, Our Lord gave special powers to the\r\nApostles to exorcize demons: “And having called his twelve disciples\r\ntogether, he gave them power over unclean spirits to cast them out, and\r\nto heal all manner of diseases, and all manner of infirmities.” And S.\r\nPeter, when describing the mission and miracles of Christ, stresses this\r\nvery point: “Jesus of Nazareth: how God anointed him with the Holy Ghost,\r\nand with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were\r\npossessed by the devil,” τοὺς καταδυναστευομένους ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου (Acts\r\nx. 38). Our Lord Himself directly appeals to His power over evil spirits\r\nas a proof of His Messiahship: “If I by the finger of God cast out\r\ndevils; doubtless the kingdom of God is come upon you”; εἰ δὲ ἐν δακτύλῳ\r\nΘεοῦ ἐκβάλλω τά δαιμόνια, ἄρα ἔφθασεν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ (S.\r\nLuke xi. 20).\r\n\r\nWhilst yet on earth Christ empowered the Apostles to cast out demons\r\nin His Name, and in His last solemn charge He promised that the same\r\ndelegated power should be perpetuated: “These signs shall follow them\r\nthat believe: in my name they shall cast out devils”; σημεῖα δὲ τοῖς\r\nπιστεύσασι ταῦτα παρακολουθήσει· ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου δαιμόνια ἐκβαλοῦσι\r\n(S. Mark xvi. 17.) But the efficacy of exorcism was conditional, not\r\nabsolute as in the case of Our Lord Himself, for He explained, upon an\r\noccasion when the Apostles seemed to fail, that certain spirits could\r\nonly be expelled by prayer and fasting. Moreover, a perfect belief and\r\ncomplete command are necessary for the exorcizer. τότε προσέλθοντες οἱ\r\nμαθηταὶ τῷ Ἱησοῦ κατ ἰδίαν εἶπον, Διατί ἡμεῖς οὐκ ἠδυνήθημεν ἐκβαλεῖν\r\nαὐτό; ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς λέγει αὐτοῖς, Διὰ τὲν ὀλιγοπιστίαν ὑμῶν· ... τοῦτο δὲ\r\nτὸ γένος οὐκ ἑκπορεύεται εἰ μὴ ἐν προσευχῇ καὶ νηστείᾳ ... (S. Matthew\r\nxvii. 19-21). S. Paul, and no doubt the other Apostles and Disciples,\r\nregularly made use of this exorcizing power. Thus, at Philippi, where\r\nthe girl “having a pythonical spirit ... who brought to her masters\r\nmuch gain by divining” (παιδίσκην τινὰ ἔχουσαν πεῦνμα πύθωνα ... ἥτις\r\nἐργασίαν πολλὴν παρεῖχε τοῖς κυρίοις αὐτῆς μαντευπμένη)[34] met S. Paul\r\nand S. Luke and proclaimed them as servants of the most high God, S. Paul\r\n“being grieved, turned, and said to the spirit: I command thee, in the\r\nname of Jesus Christ, to go out from her. And he went out the same hour”\r\n(Acts xvi. 16-18). And at Ephesus, a hot-bed of magic and necromancy,\r\n“God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles. So that even\r\nthere were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs and aprons,\r\nand the diseases departed from them, and the wicked spirits went out of\r\nthem” (Acts xix. 11, 12). Those who do not imagine that the powers Our\r\nLord perpetually bestowed upon the Apostles and their followers abruptly\r\nceased with the thirty-first verse of the twenty-eighth chapter of The\r\nActs of the Apostles, realize that the charisma of exorcism has continued\r\nthrough the ages, and in truth the Church has uninterruptedly practised\r\nit until the present day.\r\n\r\nThe Exorcist is ordained by the Bishop for this office, ordination to\r\nwhich is the second of the four minor orders of the Western Church. Pope\r\nCornelius (251-252) mentions in his letter to Fabius that there were then\r\nin the Roman Church forty-two acolytes, and fifty-two exorcists, readers,\r\nand door-keepers, and the institution of these orders together with the\r\norganization of their functions, seems to have been the work of the\r\npredecessor of Cornelius, Pope Saint Fabian the Martyr (236-251).\r\n\r\nThe rite of the Ordination of Exorcists, “De Ordinatione Exorcistarum,”\r\nis as follows: First, the Book of Exorcisms, or in its place the\r\nPontifical or Missal must be ready at hand; _Pro Exorcistis ordinandis\r\nparetur liber exorcismorum, cuius loco dari potest Pontificale uel\r\nMissale_ (A Book of Exorcisms must be prepared for those who are to\r\nbe ordained Exorcists. Howbeit in place thereof the Pontifical or the\r\nMissal may be handed to them) runs the rubric. When the Lectors have been\r\nordained, the Bishop resuming his mitre takes his place upon his seat or\r\nfaldstool at the Epistle side of the altar, and the Missal with the bugia\r\nbeing brought by his acolytes he proceeds to read the Gradual, or (if it\r\nbe within the Octave of Pentecost) the _Alleluia_. Meantime the Gradual\r\nis sung by the choir. When it is finished, he rises, takes off his mitre,\r\nand turning to the altar intones the third collect. He next sits again,\r\nresumes his mitre, and the third Lection is read. Two chaplains assist\r\nhim with bugia and book whence he reads the Lection. The Archdeacon now\r\nsummons the ordinandi, who approach, holding lighted tapers in their\r\nhands, and kneel before the Bishop, who solemnly admonishes them with the\r\nprayer:\r\n\r\n“Dearest children who are about to be ordained to the office of\r\nExorcists, ye must duly know what ye are about to undertake. For an\r\nExorcist must cast out devils; and announce to the people that those\r\nthat may not be present at the sacrifice should retire; and at the altar\r\nminister water to the priest. Ye receive also the power of placing your\r\nhand upon energumens, and by the imposition of your hands and the grace\r\nof the Holy Spirit and the words of exorcism unclean spirits are driven\r\nout from the bodies of those who are obsessed. Be careful therefore\r\nthat as ye drive out devils from the bodies of others, so ye banish all\r\nuncleanness and evil from your own bodies lest ye fall beneath the power\r\nof those spirits who by your ministry are conquered in others. Learn\r\nthrough your office to govern all imperfections lest the enemy may claim\r\na share in you and some dominion over you. For truly will ye rightly\r\ncontrol those devils who attack others, when first ye have overcome\r\ntheir many crafts against yourselves. And this may the Lord vouchsafe to\r\ngrant you through His Holy Spirit.”[35] After which the Bishop hands to\r\neach severally the Book of Exorcisms (or Pontifical or Missal), saying:\r\n“Receive this and commit it to thy memory and have power to place thy\r\nhands upon energumens, whether they be baptized, or whether they be\r\ncatechumens.”[36] All kneel, and the Bishop, wearing his mitre, stands\r\nand prays:\r\n\r\n“Dearest brethren, let us humbly pray God the Father Almighty that He\r\nmay vouchsafe to bless these his servants to the office of Exorcists\r\nthat they may have the power to command spirits, to cast forth from\r\nthe bodies of those who are obsessed demons with every kind of their\r\nwickedness and deceit. Through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ Our\r\nLord who with Him liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\r\none God, world without end. _R._ Amen.”[37] Then, his mitre having been\r\nremoved, he turns to the altar with “Oremus” to which is given the reply\r\n“Flectamus genua” with “Leuate,” and the last prayer is said over the\r\nkneeling exorcists: “Holy Lord, Almighty Father, Eternal God vouchsafe\r\nto bless these thy servants to the office of Exorcists; that by the\r\nimposition of our hands and the words of our mouth they may have power\r\nand authority to govern and restrain all unclean spirits: that they may\r\nbe skilful physicians for Thy Church, that they may heal many and be\r\nthemselves strengthened with all Heavenly Grace. Through Our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist Thy Son who with Thee liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy\r\nSpirit one God world without end. _R._ Amen.” And then, at a sign from\r\nthe Archdeacon, they return to their places.[38]\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that the Exorcist is specifically ordained “to cast\r\nout demons,” and he receives “power to place his (your) hands upon the\r\npossessed, so that by the imposition of his (your) hands,[39] the grace\r\nof the Holy Ghost, and the words of exorcism, evil spirits are driven out\r\nfrom the bodies of the possessed.” The very striking term _spiritualis\r\nimperator_ is strictly applied to him, and God the Father is earnestly\r\nentreated to grant him the grace “to cast out demons from the bodies of\r\nthe possessed with all their many sleights of wickedness.” Nothing could\r\nbe plainer, nothing could be more solemn, nothing could be more pregnant\r\nwith meaning and intention. The Order and delegated power of Exorcists\r\ncannot be minimized; at least, so to do is clean contrary to the mind of\r\nthe Church as emphatically expressed in her most authoritative rites. In\r\nactual practice the office of Exorcist has almost wholly been taken over\r\nby clerics in major orders, but this, of course, in no way affects the\r\nstatus and authority of the second of the four minor orders.\r\n\r\nEvery priest, more especially perhaps if he be a parish priest, is\r\nliable to be called upon to perform his duty as Exorcist. In doing so\r\nhe must carefully bear in mind and adhere to the prescriptions of the\r\n_Rituale Romanum_, and he will do well to have due regard to the laws of\r\nprovincial or diocesan synods, which for the most part require that the\r\nBishop should be consulted and his authorization obtained before exorcism\r\nbe essayed.\r\n\r\nThe chief points of importance in the detailed instructions under\r\ntwenty-one heads prefixed to the rite in the _Rituale_ may thus be\r\nbriefly summarized: (1) The priest or exorcist should be of mature age,\r\nhumble, of blameless life, courageous, of experience, and well-attested\r\nprudence. It is fitting he should prepare himself for his task by\r\nspecial acts of devotion and mortification, by fervent prayer and by\r\nfasting (S. Matthew xvii. 20). (2) He must be a man of scholarship and\r\nlearning, a systematic student and well versed in the latest trends and\r\ndevelopments of psychological science. (3) Possession is not lightly\r\nto be taken for granted. Each case is to be carefully examined and\r\ngreat caution to be used in distinguishing genuine possession from\r\ncertain forms of disease. (4) He should admonish the possessed in so\r\nfar as the latter is capable, to dispose himself for the exorcism by\r\nprayer, fasting, by confession, and Holy Communion, and while the rite\r\nis in progress he must excite in his heart a most lively faith in the\r\ngoodness of God, and perfect resignation to the divine will. (5) The\r\nexorcism should take place in the Church, or some other sacred place, if\r\nconvenient, but no crowd of gazers must be suffered to assemble out of\r\nmere curiosity. There should, however, be a number of witnesses, grave\r\nand devout persons of standing, eminent respectability, and acknowledged\r\nprobity, not prone to idle gossip, but discreet and silent. If on account\r\nof sickness or for some legitimate reason the exorcism takes place in a\r\nprivate house it is well that members of the family should be present;\r\nespecially is this enjoined, as a measure of precaution, if the subject\r\nbe a woman. (6) If the patient seems to fall asleep, or endeavours to\r\nhinder the exorcist in any way during the rite he is to continue, if\r\npossible with greater insistence, for such actions are probably a ruse\r\nto trick him. (7) The exorcist, although humble and having no reliance\r\nupon himself alone, is to speak with command and authority, and should\r\nthe patient be convulsed or tremble, let him be more fervent and more\r\ninsistent; the prayers and adjurations are to be recited with great\r\nfaith, a full and assured consciousness of power. (8) Let the exorcist\r\nremember that he uses the words of Holy Scripture and Holy Church, not\r\nhis own words and phrases. (9) All idle and impertinent questioning of\r\nthe demon is to be avoided, nor should the evil spirit be allowed to\r\nspeak at length unchecked and unrebuked. (10) The Blessed Sacrament is\r\nnot to be brought near the body of the obsessed during exorcism for fear\r\nof possible irreverence; Relics of the Saints may be employed, but in\r\nthis case every care must be most scrupulously observed that all due\r\nveneration be paid to them; the Crucifix and Holy Water are to be used.\r\n(11) If expulsion of the evil spirit, who will often prove obstinate, is\r\nnot secured at once, the rite should be repeated as often as need be.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Church has safeguarded exorcism with\r\nextraordinary precautions, and that everything which is humanly possible\r\nto prevent superstition, indecorum, or abuse is provided for and\r\nrecommended. Again and again the warning is repeated that so solemn, and\r\nindeed terrible, an office must not lightly be undertaken. The actual\r\nform in present use is as follows:[40]\r\n\r\n                  THE FORM OF EXORCISING THE POSSESSED\r\n\r\n                  [TRANSLATED FROM THE “ROMAN RITUAL.”]\r\n\r\n    _The Priest, having confessed, or at least hating sin in his\r\n    heart, and having said Mass, if it possibly and conveniently\r\n    can be done, and humbly implored the Divine help, vested in\r\n    surplice and violet stole, the end of which he shall place\r\n    round the neck of the one possessed, and having the possessed\r\n    person before him, and bound if there be danger of violence,\r\n    shall sign himself, the person, and those standing by, with\r\n    the sign of the Cross, and sprinkle them with holy water, and\r\n    kneeling down, the others making the responses, shall say the\r\n    Litany as far as the prayers._\r\n\r\n    _At the end the Antiphon._ Remember not, Lord, our offences,\r\n    nor the offences of our forefathers, neither take Thou\r\n    vengeance of our sins.\r\n\r\n    Our Father. _Secretly._\r\n\r\n    ℣ And lead us not into temptation.\r\n    ℟ But deliver us from evil.\r\n\r\n    _Psalm_ liii.\r\n\r\n    _Deus, in Nomine._\r\n\r\n    _The whole shall be said with_ Glory be to the Father.\r\n\r\n    ℣. Save Thy servant,\r\n    ℟. O my God, that putteth his trust in Thee.\r\n\r\n    ℣. Be unto him, O Lord, a strong tower,\r\n    ℟. From the face of his enemy.\r\n\r\n    ℣. Let the enemy have no advantage of him,\r\n    ℟. Nor the son of wickedness approach to hurt him.\r\n\r\n    ℣. Send him help, O Lord, from the sanctuary,\r\n    ℟. And strengthen him out of Sion.\r\n\r\n    ℣. Lord, hear my prayer,\r\n    ℟. And let my cry come unto Thee.\r\n\r\n    ℣. The Lord be with you,\r\n    ℟. And with thy spirit.\r\n\r\n    Let us pray.\r\n\r\n    O God, Whose property is ever to have mercy and to forgive:\r\n    receive our supplications and prayers, that of Thy mercy\r\n    and loving-kindness Thou wilt set free this Thy servant (or\r\n    handmaid) who is fast bound by the chain of his sins.\r\n\r\n    O holy Lord, Father Almighty, Eternal God, the Father of our\r\n    Lord Jesus Christ: Who hast assigned that tyrant and apostate\r\n    to the fires of hell; and hast sent Thine Only Begotten Son\r\n    into the world, that He might bruise him as he roars after\r\n    his prey: make haste, tarry not, to deliver this man, created\r\n    in Thine Own image and likeness, from ruin, and from the\r\n    noon-day devil. Send Thy fear, O Lord, upon the wild beast,\r\n    which devoureth Thy vine. Grant Thy servants boldness to fight\r\n    bravely against that wicked dragon, lest he despise them that\r\n    put their trust in Thee, and say, as once he spake in Pharaoh:\r\n    I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go. Let Thy\r\n    right hand in power compel him to depart from Thy servant N.\r\n    (or Thy handmaid N.) ✠, that he dare no longer to hold him\r\n    captive, whom Thou hast vouchsafed to make in Thine image, and\r\n    hast redeemed in Thy Son; Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in\r\n    the Unity of the Holy Spirit, ever One God, world without end.\r\n    Amen.\r\n\r\n    _Then he shall command the spirit in this manner._\r\n\r\n    I command thee, whosoever thou art, thou unclean spirit, and\r\n    all thy companions possessing this servant of God, that by\r\n    the Mysteries of the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection and\r\n    Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, by the sending of the Holy\r\n    Ghost, and by the Coming of the same our Lord to judgment,\r\n    thou tell me thy name, the day, and the hour of thy going out,\r\n    by some sign: and, that to me, a minister of God, although\r\n    unworthy, thou be wholly obedient in all things: nor hurt this\r\n    creature of God, or those that stand by, or their goods in any\r\n    way.\r\n\r\n    _Then shall these Gospels, or one or the other, be read over\r\n    the possessed._\r\n\r\n    The Lesson of the Holy Gospel according to S. John i. 1. _As he\r\n    says these words he shall sign himself and the possessed on the\r\n    forehead, mouth, and breast._ In the beginning was the Word ...\r\n    full of grace and truth.\r\n\r\n    The Lesson of the Holy Gospel according to S. Mark xvi. 15. At\r\n    that time: Jesus spake unto His disciples: Go ye into all the\r\n    world ... shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\r\n\r\n    The Lesson of the Holy Gospel according to S. Luke x. 17. At\r\n    that time: The seventy returned again with joy ... because your\r\n    names are written in heaven.\r\n\r\n    The Lesson of the Holy Gospel according to S. Luke xi. 14. At\r\n    that time: Jesus was casting out a devil, and it was dumb ...\r\n    wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.\r\n\r\n    ℣. Lord, hear my prayer,\r\n    ℟. And let my cry come unto Thee.\r\n\r\n    ℣. The Lord be with you,\r\n    ℟. And with thy Spirit.\r\n\r\n    Let us pray.\r\n\r\n    Almighty Lord, Word of God the Father, Jesus Christ, God and\r\n    Lord of every creature: Who didst give to Thy Holy Apostles\r\n    power to tread upon serpents and scorpions: Who amongst other\r\n    of Thy wonderful commands didst vouchsafe to say—Put the\r\n    devils to flight: by Whose power Satan fell from heaven like\r\n    lightning: with supplication I beseech Thy Holy Name in fear\r\n    and trembling, that to me Thy most unworthy servant, granting\r\n    me pardon of all my faults, Thou wilt vouchsafe to give\r\n    constancy of faith and power, that shielded by the might of Thy\r\n    holy arm, in trust and safety I may approach to attack this\r\n    cruel devil, through Thee, O Jesus Christ, the Lord our God,\r\n    Who shalt come to judge the quick and the dead, and the world\r\n    by fire. Amen.\r\n\r\n    _Then defending himself and the possessed with the sign of the\r\n    Cross, putting part of his stole round the neck, and his right\r\n    hand upon the head of the possessed, firmly and with great\r\n    faith he shall say what follows._\r\n\r\n    ℣. Behold the Cross of the Lord, flee ye of the contrary part,\r\n    ℟. The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed.\r\n\r\n    ℣. Lord, hear my prayer,\r\n    ℟. And let my cry come unto Thee.\r\n\r\n    ℣. The Lord be with you,\r\n    ℟. And with thy spirit.\r\n\r\n    Let us pray.\r\n\r\n    O God, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, I call upon Thy\r\n    Holy Name, and humbly implore Thy mercy, that Thou wouldest\r\n    vouchsafe to grant me help against this, and every unclean\r\n    spirit, that vexes this Thy creature. Through the same Lord\r\n    Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n                              THE EXORCISM.\r\n\r\n    I exorcise thee, most foul spirit, every coming in of the\r\n    enemy, every apparition, every legion; in the Name of our\r\n    Lord Jesus ✠ Christ be rooted out, and be put to flight from\r\n    this creature of God ✠. He commands thee, Who has bid thee be\r\n    cast down from the highest heaven into the lower parts of the\r\n    earth. He commands thee, Who has commanded the sea, the winds,\r\n    and the storms. Hear therefore, and fear, Satan, thou injurer\r\n    of the faith, thou enemy of the human race, thou procurer\r\n    of death, thou destroyer of life, kindler of vices, seducer\r\n    of men, betrayer of the nations, inciter of envy, origin of\r\n    avarice, cause of discord, stirrer-up of troubles: why standest\r\n    thou, and resistest, when thou knowest that Christ the Lord\r\n    destroyest thy ways? Fear Him, Who was sacrificed in Isaac, Who\r\n    was sold in Joseph, was slain in the Lamb, was crucified in\r\n    man, thence was the triumpher over hell. _The following signs\r\n    of the Cross shall be made upon the forehead of the possessed._\r\n    Depart therefore in the Name of the Father ✠, and of the Son ✠,\r\n    and of the Holy ✠ Ghost: give place to the Holy Ghost, by this\r\n    sign of the holy ✠ Cross of Jesus Christ our Lord: Who with\r\n    the Father, and the same Holy Ghost, liveth and reigneth ever\r\n    one God, world without end. Amen.\r\n\r\n    ℣. Lord, hear my prayer.\r\n    ℟. And let my cry come unto Thee.\r\n\r\n    ℣. The Lord be with you.\r\n    ℟. And with thy spirit.\r\n\r\n    Let us pray.\r\n\r\n    O God, the Creator and Protector of the human race, Who hast\r\n    formed man in Thine own Image: look upon this Thy servant N.\r\n    (_or_ this Thy handmaid N.), who is grievously vexed with\r\n    the wiles of an unclean spirit, whom the old adversary, the\r\n    ancient enemy of the earth, encompasses with a horrible dread,\r\n    and blinds the senses of his human understanding with stupor,\r\n    confounds him with terror, and harasses him with trembling\r\n    and fear. Drive away, O Lord, the power of the devil, take\r\n    away his deceitful snares: let the impious tempter fly far\r\n    hence: let Thy servant be defended by the sign ✠ (_on his\r\n    forehead_) of Thy Name, and be safe both in body, and soul.\r\n    (_The three following crosses shall be made on the breast of\r\n    the demoniac._) Do Thou guard his inmost ✠ soul, Thou rule his\r\n    inward ✠ parts, Thou strengthen his ✠ heart. Let the attempts\r\n    of the opposing power in his soul vanish away. Grant, O Lord,\r\n    grace to this invocation of Thy most Holy Name, that he who up\r\n    to this present was causing terror, may flee away affrighted,\r\n    and depart conquered; and that this Thy servant, strengthened\r\n    in heart, and sincere in mind, may render Thee his due service.\r\n    Through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\r\n\r\n                              THE EXORCISM.\r\n\r\n    I adjure thee, thou old serpent, by the Judge of the quick\r\n    and the dead, by thy Maker, and the Maker of the world: by\r\n    Him, Who hath power to put thee into hell, that thou depart\r\n    in haste from this servant of God N., who returns to the\r\n    bosom of the Church, with thy fear and with the torment of\r\n    thy terror. I adjure Thee again ✠ (_on his forehead_), not in\r\n    my infirmity, but by the power of the Holy Ghost, that thou\r\n    go out of this servant of God N., whom the Almighty God hath\r\n    made in His Own Image. Yield, therefore, not to me, but to the\r\n    minister of Christ. For His power presses upon thee Who subdued\r\n    thee beneath His Cross. Tremble at His arm, which, after the\r\n    groanings of hell were subdued, led forth the souls into light.\r\n    Let the body ✠ (_on his breast_) of man be a terror to thee,\r\n    let the image of God ✠ (_on his forehead_) be an alarm to thee.\r\n    Resist not, nor delay to depart from this person, for it has\r\n    pleased Christ to dwell in man. And think not that I am to be\r\n    despised, since thou knowest that I too am so great a sinner.\r\n    God ✠ commands thee. The majesty of Christ ✠ commands thee. God\r\n    the Father ✠ commands thee. God the Son ✠ commands thee. God\r\n    the Holy ✠ Ghost commands thee. The Sacrament of the Cross ✠\r\n    commands thee. The faith of the holy Apostles Peter and Paul,\r\n    and of all the other Saints ✠, commands thee. The blood of\r\n    the Martyrs ✠ commands thee. The stedfastness (_continentia_)\r\n    of the Confessors ✠ commands thee. The devout intercession of\r\n    all the Saints ✠ commands thee. The virtue of the Mysteries of\r\n    the Christian Faith ✠ commands thee. Go out, therefore, thou\r\n    transgressor. Go out, thou seducer, full of all deceit and\r\n    wile, thou enemy of virtue, thou persecutor of innocence. Give\r\n    place, thou most dire one: give place, thou most impious one:\r\n    give place to Christ in Whom thou hast found nothing of thy\r\n    works: Who hath overcome thee, Who hath destroyed thy kingdom,\r\n    Who hath led thee captive and bound thee, and hath spoiled thy\r\n    goods: Who hath cast thee into outer darkness, where for thee\r\n    and thy servants everlasting destruction is prepared. But why,\r\n    O fierce one, dost thou withstand? why, rashly bold, dost thou\r\n    refuse? thou art the accused of Almighty God, whose laws thou\r\n    hast broken. Thou art the accused of Jesus Christ our Lord,\r\n    whom thou hast dared to tempt, and presumed to crucify. Thou\r\n    art the accused of the human race, to whom by thy persuasion\r\n    thou hast given to drink thy poison. Therefore, I adjure thee,\r\n    most wicked dragon, in the Name of the immaculate ✠ Lamb, Who\r\n    treads upon the lion and adder, Who tramples under foot the\r\n    young lion and the dragon, that thou depart from this man ✠\r\n    (_let the sign be made upon his forehead_), that thou depart\r\n    from the Church of God ✠ (_let the sign be made over those\r\n    who are standing by_): tremble, and flee away at the calling\r\n    upon the Name of that Lord, of Whom hell is afraid; to Whom\r\n    the Virtues, the Powers, and the Dominions of the heavens are\r\n    subject; Whom Cherubim and Seraphim with unwearied voices\r\n    praise, saying: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth. The\r\n    Word ✠ made Flesh commands thee. He Who was born ✠ of the\r\n    Virgin commands thee. Jesus ✠ of Nazareth commands thee; Who,\r\n    although thou didst despise His disciples, bade thee go bruised\r\n    and overthrown out of the man: and in his presence, having\r\n    separated thee from him, thou didst not presume to enter into\r\n    the herd of swine. Therefore, thus now adjured in His Name ✠,\r\n    depart from the man, whom He has formed. It is hard for thee\r\n    to wish to resist ✠. It is hard for thee to kick against the\r\n    pricks ✠. Because the more slowly goest thou out, does the\r\n    greater punishment increase against thee, for thou despisest\r\n    not men, but Him, Who is Lord both of the quick and the dead,\r\n    Who shall come to judge the quick and the dead, and the World\r\n    by fire. ℟. Amen.\r\n\r\n    ℣. Lord, hear my prayer.\r\n    ℟. And let my cry come unto thee.\r\n\r\n    ℣. The Lord be with you.\r\n    ℟. And with thy spirit.\r\n\r\n    Let us pray.\r\n\r\n    O God of heaven, God of earth, God of the Angels, God of the\r\n    Archangels, God of the Prophets, God of the Apostles, God of\r\n    the Martyrs, God of the Virgins, God, Who hast the power to\r\n    give life after death, rest after labour; because there is none\r\n    other God beside Thee, nor could be true, but Thou, the Creator\r\n    of heaven and earth, Who art the true King, and of Whose\r\n    kingdom there shall be no end: humbly I beseech Thy glorious\r\n    majesty, that Thou wouldest vouchsafe to deliver this Thy\r\n    servant from unclean spirits, through Christ our Lord. Amen.\r\n\r\n                              THE EXORCISM.\r\n\r\n    I therefore adjure thee, thou most foul spirit, every\r\n    appearance, every inroad of Satan, in the Name of Jesus Christ\r\n    ✠ of Nazareth, Who, after His baptism in Jordan, was led into\r\n    the wilderness, and overcame thee in thine own stronghold: that\r\n    thou cease to assault him whom He hath formed from the dust\r\n    of the earth for His own honour and glory: and that thou in\r\n    miserable man tremble not at human weakness, but at the image\r\n    of Almighty God. Yield, therefore, to God ✠ Who by His servant\r\n    Moses drowned thee and thy malice in Pharaoh and his army in\r\n    the depths of the sea. Yield to God ✠ Who put thee to flight\r\n    when driven out of King Saul with spiritual song, by his most\r\n    faithful servant David. Yield thyself to God ✠ Who condemned\r\n    thee in the traitor Judas Iscariot. For He touches thee with\r\n    Divine ✠ stripes, when in His sight, trembling and crying out\r\n    with thy legions, thou saidst: What have I to do with Thee,\r\n    Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Art Thou come hither to\r\n    torment us before the time? He presses upon thee with perpetual\r\n    flames, Who shall say to the wicked at the end of time—Depart\r\n    from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the\r\n    devil and his angels. For thee, O impious one, and for thy\r\n    angels, is the worm that dieth not; for thee and thy angels\r\n    is the fire unquenchable prepared: for thou art the chief of\r\n    accursed murder, thou the author of incest, thou the head of\r\n    sacrileges, thou the master of the worst actions, thou the\r\n    teacher of heretics, thou the instigator of all uncleanness.\r\n    Therefore go out ✠ thou wicked one, go out ✠, thou infamous\r\n    one, go out with all thy deceits; for God hath willed that man\r\n    shall be His temple. But why dost thou delay longer here? Give\r\n    honour to God the Father ✠ Almighty, before Whom every knee is\r\n    bent. Give place to Jesus Christ ✠ the Lord, Who shed for man\r\n    His most precious Blood. Give place to the Holy ✠ Ghost, Who by\r\n    His blessed Apostle Peter struck thee to the ground in Simon\r\n    Magus; Who condemned thy deceit in Ananias and Sapphira; Who\r\n    smote thee in Herod, because he gave not God the glory; Who by\r\n    his Apostle Paul smote thee in Elymas the sorcerer with a mist\r\n    and darkness, and by the same Apostle by his word of command\r\n    bade thee come out of the damsel possessed with the spirit\r\n    of divination. Now therefore depart ✠, depart, thou seducer.\r\n    The wilderness is thy abode. The serpent is the place of thy\r\n    habitation: be humbled, and be overthrown. There is no time now\r\n    for delay. For behold the Lord the Ruler approaches closely\r\n    upon thee, and His fire shall glow before Him, and shall go\r\n    before Him; and shall burn up His enemies on every side. If\r\n    thou hast deceived man, at God thou canst not scoff: One\r\n    expels thee, from Whose Sight nothing is hidden. He casts thee\r\n    out, to Whose power all things are subject. He shuts thee out,\r\n    Who hast prepared for thee and for thine angels everlasting\r\n    hell; out of Whose mouth the sharp sword shall go out, when He\r\n    shall come to judge the quick and the dead, and the World by\r\n    fire. Amen.\r\n\r\n    _All the aforesaid things being said and done, so far as there\r\n    shall be need, they shall be repeated, until the possessed\r\n    person be entirely set free._\r\n\r\n    _The following which are noted down will be of great\r\n    assistance, said devoutly over the possessed, and also\r\n    frequently to repeat the_ Our Father, Hail Mary, _and_ Creed.\r\n\r\n    _The Canticle._ Magnificat.\r\n\r\n    _The Canticle._ Benedictus.\r\n\r\n                         _The Creed of S.

Amen.\r\n\r\nA shorter form of exorcism, which, being general, differs in aim and use,\r\nwas published by order of Pope Leo XIII and may be found in the later\r\neditions of the _Rituale Romanum_, “Exorcismus in Satanam et Angelos\r\napostalicos.”[41] After the customary invocation _In nomine_ ... the rite\r\nbegins with a prayer to S. Michael, the solemn adjuration of some length\r\nfollows with versicles and responses, a second prayer is next recited,\r\nand the whole concludes by three aspirations from the Litany: “From the\r\ndeceits and crafts of the Devil; O Lord, deliver us. That it may please\r\nThee to rule Thy Church so it shall alway serve Thee in lasting peace and\r\ntrue liberty; We beseech Thee, hear us. That Thou wouldst vouchsafe to\r\nbeat down and subdue all the enemies of Thy Holy Church; We beseech Thee,\r\nhear us.” _And the place is sprinkled with Holy Water_,[42] is the final\r\nrubric.\r\n\r\nThe Baptismal Exorcism and exorcisms such as those of water, salt,[43]\r\nand oil, it were perhaps impertinent to treat of here. It may, however,\r\nbe noticed that in the ceremony of the Blessing of the Waters[44]\r\n(approved by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, 6 December, 1890),\r\nperformed on the Vigil of the Epiphany, there occurs a solemn “Exorcismus\r\ncontra Satanam et Angelos apostalicos,” followed by “Exorcismus salis”\r\nand “Exorcismus aquæ.”\r\n\r\nThere are recorded throughout history innumerable examples of obsession\r\nand demoniacal possession, as also of potent and successful exorcism. It\r\nis, of course, quite possible, and indeed probable, that many of these\r\ncases were due to natural causes, epilepsy, acute hysteria, incipient\r\nlunacy, and the like. But, none the less, when every allowance has been\r\nmade for incorrect diagnosis, for ill-informed ascriptions of rare and\r\nobscure forms of both physical and mental maladies, for credulity, honest\r\nmistakes, and exaggerations of every kind, there will yet remain a very\r\nconsiderable quota which it seems impossible to account for and explain\r\nsave on the score of possession by some evil and hostile intelligence.\r\nBut nobody is asked to accept all the instances of diabolic possession\r\nrecorded in the history of the Church, nor even to form any definite\r\nopinion upon the historical evidence in favour of any particular\r\ncase. That is primarily a matter for historical and medical science.\r\nAnd, perhaps, even at the present day and among civilized races this\r\nphenomenon is not so rare as is popularly supposed.\r\n\r\nThe annals of Bedlam, of many a private madhouse, and many an asylum\r\ncould tell strange and hideous histories. And if we may judge from the\r\naccounts furnished by the pioneers of the Faith in missionary countries\r\nthe evidences of diabolical agency there are as clearly defined and\r\nunmistakable as they were in Galilee in the time of Christ.[45]\r\n\r\nDemoniacal possession is frequently described and alluded to by the early\r\nfathers and apologists in matter-of-fact terms which leave no shadow of\r\ndoubt as to their belief in this regard. Indeed the success of Christian\r\nexorcism is often brought forward as an argument for the acceptance of\r\nthe Divinity of the founder of Christianity. It would be an easy, but\r\na very lengthy process, to make a catena of such passages from Greek\r\nand Latin authors alike.[46] S. Justin Martyr (_ob._ _circa_ A.D. 165)\r\nspeaks of demons flying from “the touch and breathing of Christians”\r\n(_Apologia_, II, 6), “as from a flame that burns them,” adds S. Cyril\r\nof Jerusalem (_ob._ 385-6: _Catechesis_, XX, 3). Origen (_ob._ 253-4)\r\nmentions the laying on of hands to cast out devils, whilst S. Ambrose[47]\r\n(_ob._ 397), S. Ephrem Syrus[48] (_ob._ 373), and others used this\r\nceremony when exorcizing. The holy sign of the Cross also is extolled by\r\nmany Fathers for its efficacy against all kinds of diabolic molestation;\r\nthus Lactantius writes: “Nunc satis est, huius signi [Crucis] potentiam,\r\nquantum ualeat exponere. Quanto terrori sit dæmonibus hoc signum,\r\nsciet, qui uiderit, quatenus adiurati per Christum, de corporibus, quæ\r\nobsederint, fugiant,”[49] _Diuinarum Institutionum_, IV, xxvii.[50] S.\r\nAthanasius (_ob._ 373), _De Incarnatione Uerbi_, XLVII; S. Basil (_ob._\r\n379), _In Esaiam_, XI, 249; S. Cyril of Jerusalem, _Catechesis_, XIII;\r\nS. Gregory of Nazianzus (_ob._ _circa_ 389), _Carmen aduersus Iram_, 415\r\n_sqq._, all have passages of no little weight to the same effect. S.\r\nCyril, _Procatechesis_, IX; and S. Athanasius, _Ad Marcellum_, XXIII,\r\nrecommend that the prayers of exorcism and the adjuration should as far\r\nas possible repeat the exact words of Holy Scripture.\r\n\r\nIn the annals of hagiography we find from the earliest days until our\r\nown time very many instances of possession, very many cases where a poor\r\nafflicted wretch has been released and relieved by the power and prayer\r\nof some Saint or holy servant of God.[51]\r\n\r\nThus in the life of S. Benedict, that noble, calm, dignified, prudent,\r\ngreat-souled, and high-minded hero, there are recorded several\r\noccasions upon which he was confronted by extraordinary manifestations\r\nof evil spirits who resisted the building of his monastery upon the\r\ncrest of Monte Cassino, where Satanism had been previously practised.\r\nIt is not said that there were any visible appearances, save to S.\r\nBenedict alone,[52] but a succession of untoward accidents, of abnormal\r\noccurrences and constant alarms, plainly showed that the Saint was\r\ncontending against superhuman difficulties. More than once he found it\r\nnecessary to exorcize certain of his monks,[53] and so marked was his\r\ntriumph over these malignant and destructive influences that he has\r\nalways been venerated in the Church as a most potent “effugator dæmonum,”\r\nand is confidently invoked in the hour of spiritual peril and deadly\r\nattack. Great faith also is placed in the Medal of Saint Benedict. This\r\nmedal, originally a cross, is dedicated to the devotion in honour of the\r\nPatriarch. One side bears the figure of the Saint holding a cross in his\r\nright hand, and the Holy Rule in his left. Upon the other is a cross\r\ntogether with the following letters arranged on and around it: C.S.P.B.,\r\nCrux Sancti Patris Benedicti (The Cross of the holy Father Benedict).\r\nC.S.S.M.L., Crux Sacra Sit Mihi Lux (May the holy Cross be my Light).\r\nN.D.S.M.D., Non Draco Sit Mihi Dux (Let not the Devil be my guide).\r\nU.R.S.: N.S.M.U.: S.M.Q.L.: I.U.B.: Uade Retro Satana: Nunquam Suade\r\nMihi Uana: Sunt Mala Quæ Libas: Ipse Uenena Bibas. (Begone, Satan, never\r\nsuggest things to me, what thou offerest is evil, drink thou thyself thy\r\npoison).[54] The “Centenary” form of the medal (struck at Monte Cassino\r\nin 1880 to commemorate the 13th centenary of the birth of S. Benedict in\r\n480) has under the figure the words: _Ex S.M. Cassino MDCCCLXXX_. Upon\r\nthe same side round the edge runs the inscription: Eius in obitu n̅r̅o\r\npræsentia muniamur (May we be protected by his presence at the hour of\r\nour death), and the word PAX appears above the cross.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful when the Medal of S. Benedict originated, but during\r\na trial for Witchcraft at Natternberg, near the abbey of Metten, in\r\nBavaria, during the year 1647, the accused women testified that they had\r\nno power over Metten which was under the particular protection of the\r\ncross. Upon investigation a number of painted crosses surrounded by the\r\nletters which are now engraved upon Benedictine medals were found on the\r\nwalls of the abbey, but their signification had been wholly forgotten. At\r\nlength, in an old manuscript, written in 1415, was discovered a picture\r\nrepresenting S. Benedict holding in one hand a staff which ended in a\r\ncross, and in the other a scroll. On the staff and scroll were written\r\nin full the formulas of which the mysterious letters were the initials.\r\nMedals with the figure of S. Benedict, a cross, and these letters began\r\nnow to be struck and rapidly spread over Europe. The medals were first\r\nauthoritatively approved by Benedict XIV in his briefs of 23 December,\r\n1741, and 12 March, 1742.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the possessed boys of Illfurt (Alsace) they exhibited the\r\nutmost horror and dread of a Medal of S. Benedict.\r\n\r\nThese medals are hallowed with a proper rite[55] in which the adjuration\r\ncommences: “Exorcizo uos, numismata, per Deum Patrem ✠ omnipotentem....”\r\n“I exorcize ye, medals, through God the Father ✠ Almighty.... May the\r\npower of the adversary, all the host of the Devil, all evil attack,\r\nevery spirit and glamour of Satan, be utterly put to flight and driven\r\nfar away by the virtue of these medals....”[56] The prayer runs: “O Lord\r\nJesus Christ ... by Thy most Holy Passion I humbly pray and beseech Thee,\r\nthat Thou wouldest grant that whosoever devoutly invoketh Thy Holy Name\r\nin this prayer and petition which Thou Thyself hast taught us, may be\r\ndelivered from every deceit of the Devil and from all his wiles, and that\r\nThou wouldest vouchsafe to bring Thy servant to the harbour of salvation.\r\nWho livest and reignest....”[57]\r\n\r\nS. Maurus also, the beloved disciple of S. Benedict, was famous for the\r\ncures he wrought in cases of possession.[58] Visiting France in 543 he\r\nbecame founder and superior of the abbey of Glanfeuil, Anjou, later\r\nknown by his name, St. Maur-sur-Loise.[59] The relics of S. Maurus after\r\nvarious translations were finally enshrined at St. Germain-des-Prez.\r\nIn the eleventh century an arm of the Saint had been with great\r\ndevotion transferred to Monte Cassino, where by its touch a demoniac\r\nwas delivered. This is related by Desiderius,[60] who was abbot at that\r\ntime, and afterwards became Pope, Blessed Victor III (_ob._ 16 September,\r\n1087). Throughout the Middle Ages the tomb of S. Maur at St. Germain was\r\na celebrated place of pilgrimage, and the possessed were brought here in\r\nlarge numbers to be healed.[61]\r\n\r\nThe Holy Winding Sheet of Besançon, again, was greatly resorted to for\r\nthe relief and cure of possession. This venerable relic, being one of\r\nthe linen cloths used at the burial of Christ, was brought to Besançon\r\nin 1206 by Otto de la Roche, and the feast of its arrival (_Susceptio_)\r\nwas ordered to be kept on 11 July. At present it is a double of the first\r\nclass in the cathedral, St. Jean, and of the second class throughout the\r\ndiocese.\r\n\r\nNovenas made in the church at Bonnet, near Nantes, were popularly\r\nsupposed to be of especial efficacy in healing possession.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible even briefly to catalogue the most important\r\nand striking of the numberless cases of possession recorded throughout\r\nthe centuries in every country and at every era. Of these a great number\r\nare, no doubt, to be attributed to disease; very many to a commixture of\r\nhysteria and semi-conscious, or more frequently unconscious, fraud; some\r\nfew to mere chousing; and, if human evidence is worth anything at all,\r\nmany actually to diabolic influence.\r\n\r\nThere were some curious episodes in England during Queen Elizabeth’s\r\nreign, when a third-rate Puritan minister, John Darrel, made a\r\nconsiderable stir owing to his attempts at exorcism. This idea seems\r\nto have been suggested to him by the exorcisms of the famous Jesuit\r\nmissionary priest, William Weston, who after having been educated at\r\nOxford, Paris, and Douai, entered the Society on 5 November, 1575, at\r\nRome. He then worked and taught in Spain, until he was called to his\r\nnative mission, actually arriving in England, 20 September, 1584. In\r\nthe course of his labours, which at that dangerous time were carried\r\non in circumstances of extremest peril, he was required to perform the\r\nrite of exorcism upon several distressed persons, who were for the most\r\npart brought to him at the houses of two zealous Catholics, Sir George\r\nPeckham of Denham, near Uxbridge, and Lord Vaux of Hackney, both of\r\nwhich gentlemen had suffered in many ways for their faith. With regard\r\nto the patients we can only say that we lack evidence to enable us to\r\ndecide whether the cases were genuine, or whether they were merely sick\r\nand ailing folk; but we can confidently affirm that there is no suspicion\r\nof any fraud or cozenage. Father Weston is acknowledged to have been\r\na man of the most candid sincerity, intensely spiritual, and of no\r\nordinary powers. Although the rites, in which several priests joined,\r\nwere performed with the utmost secrecy and every precaution was taken to\r\nprevent any report being spread abroad, somebody gossiped, and in about a\r\nyear various exaggerated accounts were being circulated, until the matter\r\ncame before the Privy Council. A violent recrudescence of persecution at\r\nonce followed, many of the exorcists were seized and butchered for their\r\npriesthood, the rest, including Weston, were flung into jail, August,\r\n1586. A long period of imprisonment ensued, and in 1599 Weston was\r\ncommitted to the Tower, where he suffered such hardships that he wellnigh\r\nlost his sight. Eventually in 1603 he was banished, and spent the rest of\r\nhis days at Seville and Valladolid. He was rector of the latter college\r\nat the time of his death, 9 June, 1615.[62]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1586, just when the exorcisms of the Jesuit fathers had\r\nunfortunately attracted so widespread attention and foolish comment,\r\nthat John Darrel, although a Protestant and lacking both appropriate\r\nordination and training, rashly resolved to emulate their achievements.\r\nHe was young, not much more than twenty, he was foolhardy and he was\r\nignorant, three qualities which even in our own time often win cheap\r\nnotoriety. It seems that he was first called in to cure a young girl of\r\nseventeen, Katherine Wright, who lived at Mansfield, Nottingham. Darrel\r\nforthwith pronounced that she was afflicted by an evil spirit, and he\r\nprayed over her from four o’clock in the morning till noon, but entirely\r\nwithout result. He then declared that the wench had been bewitched and\r\nthat the demon, moreover, was sent by one Margaret Roper, with whom the\r\npatient had recently quarrelled. The girl backed his story, and the\r\naccused woman was at once taken into custody by the constable. When,\r\nhowever, she appeared before Mr. Fouliamb, a justice of the peace, not\r\nonly was she incontinently discharged, but Darrel received a smart rebuff\r\nand found himself in no small danger of arrest.\r\n\r\nThis mischance sufficiently scared the would-be exorcist, and for some\r\nten years he disappeared from view, only to come before the public again\r\nat Burton-upon-Trent, where he was prominent in the sensation and the\r\nscandal that centred round Thomas Darling, a young Derbyshire boy. This\r\nimaginative juvenal was subject to fits—real or feigned—during which he\r\nhad visions of green angels and a green cat. Betimes his conversation\r\nbecame larded with true Puritan cant, and he loved to discourse with\r\ngodly ministers. A credulous physician suggested that the lad was\r\nbewitched, and very soon afterwards it was noticed that the reading\r\naloud of the Bible, especially certain verses in the first chapter of S.\r\nJohn’s Gospel, threw him into frantic convulsions. He also began a long\r\nprattling tale about “a little old woman” who wore “a broad thrimmed\r\nhat,” which proved amply sufficient to cause two women, Elizabeth\r\nWright, and her daughter, Alse Gooderidge, long vehemently suspected of\r\nsorcery, to be examined before two magistrates, who committed Alse to\r\njail. Next those concerned summoned a cunning man, who used various rough\r\nmethods to induce the prisoner to confess. After having been harried and\r\neven tortured the wretched creature made some rambling and incoherent\r\nacknowledgements of guilt, which were twisted into a connected story. By\r\nnow Darling had been ill for three months, and so far from improving, was\r\ngetting worse.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, exactly the dramatic moment, John Darrel, full of\r\nbluff and bounce, appeared upon the scene, and forthwith took charge\r\nof affairs. According to his own account his efforts were singularly\r\nblessed; that is to say the boy got better and the sly Puritan claimed\r\nall the credit. Alse Gooderidge was tried at the assizes, convicted by\r\nthe jury, and sentenced to death by Lord Chief Justice Anderson; “She\r\nshould have been executed but that her spirit killed her in prison,” says\r\nJohn Denison the pamphleteer! The whole affair greatly increased Darrel’s\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nNot long after a much-bruited case of alleged possession in Lancashire\r\ngave him further opportunity to pose in the limelight. Ann Starchie, aged\r\nnine, and John, her brother, aged ten, were seized with a mysterious\r\ndisorder; “a certaine fearefull starting and pulling together of her\r\nbody” affected the girl, whilst the boy was “compelled to shout” on his\r\nway to school. Both grew steadily worse until their father, Nicholas\r\nStarchie, consulted Edmund Hartley, a notorious conjurer of no very fair\r\nrepute. Hartley seems to have quieted the children by means of various\r\ncharms, and the father paid him something like a retaining fee of forty\r\nshillings a year. This, however, he insisted should be increased, and\r\nwhen any addition was denied, there were quarrels, and presently the\r\nboy and girl again fell ill. The famous Dr. Dee was summoned, but he\r\nwas obviously nonplussed, and whilst he “sharply reproved and straitly\r\nexamined” Hartley, in his quandary could do or say little more save\r\nadvise the help of “godlie preachers.” The situation in that accursed\r\nhouse now began to grow more serious. Besides the children three young\r\nwards of Mr. Starchie, a servant, and a visitor, were all seized with the\r\nstrange disease. “All or most of them joined together in a strange and\r\nsupernatural loud whupping that the house and grounde did sounde therwith\r\nagain.” Hartley fell under suspicion, and was haled before a justice\r\nof the peace, who promptly committed him to the assizes. Evidence was\r\ngiven that he was continually kissing the Starchie children, in fact,\r\nhe kept embracing all the possessed, and it was argued that he had thus\r\ncommunicated an evil spirit to them. He was accused of having drawn magic\r\ncircles upon the ground, and although he stoutly denied the charge, he\r\nwas convicted of felony and hanged at Lancaster. John Darrel and his\r\nassistant, George More, minister of a church in Derbyshire, undertook\r\nto exorcize the afflicted, and in a day or two, after long prayers and\r\ngreat endeavours, they managed to expel the devils. Here we have folly,\r\nimposture, and hysteria all blended together to make a horrible tale.\r\n\r\nAt this time Darrel was officiating as a minister at Nottingham, where\r\nthere happened to be living a young apprenticed musician, a clever and\r\nlikely lad, William Somers, who some years before had met Darrel at\r\nAshby-de-la-Zouch, where both had been resident. It appears that the boy\r\nhad once met a strange woman, whom he offended in some way, and suddenly\r\nhe “did use such strang and idle kinde of gestures in laughing, dancing,\r\nand such like lighte behaviour, that he was suspected to be madd.” The\r\nfamous exorcist was sent for on the 5th of November, 1597, and forthwith\r\nrecognized the signs of possession. The lad was suffering for the sins of\r\nNottingham. Accordingly sermons were delivered and prayers were read in\r\ntrue ranting fashion, and when Darrel named one after the other fourteen\r\nsigns of possession the patient, who had been most carefully coached,\r\nillustrated each in turn.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Darrel had to some extent mesmeric control over\r\nSomers, whose performance was of a very remarkable nature at least, for\r\n“he tore; he foamed; he wallowed; his face was drawn awry; his eyes would\r\nstare and his tongue hang out”; together with a thousand other such apish\r\nantics which greatly impressed the bystanders. Finally the boy lay as if\r\ndead for a quarter of an hour, and then rose up declaring he was well and\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nHowever, obsession followed possession. The demon still assailed him, and\r\nit was not long before Master Somers accused thirteen women of having\r\ncontrived his maladies by their sorcery. Darrel, the witch-finder, had\r\nby this time attained a position of no small importance in the town,\r\nbeing chosen preacher at S. Mary’s, and he was prepared to back his\r\npupil to the uttermost. Yet even his influence for some reason did not\r\nserve, and all but two of the women concerned were released from prison.\r\nNext certain unbelieving citizens had the bad taste to interfere, and to\r\ncarry off the chief actor to the house of correction, where he pretty\r\nsoon confessed his impostures, in which, as he acknowledged, he had been\r\ncarefully instructed by Darrel. The matter now became a public scandal,\r\nand upon the report of the Archdeacon of Derby the Archbishop of York\r\nappointed a commission to inquire into the facts. Brought before these\r\nministers, not one of whom could possibly have had any means of forming a\r\ncorrect judgement, Somers retracted his words, asserted that he had been\r\ninduced to slander Darrel, and thereat fell into such fits, foamings, and\r\ncontortions that the ignoramuses were convinced of the reality of his\r\ndemoniac possession.\r\n\r\nAt the Nottingham assizes, however, things went differently. Summoned to\r\ncourt and encouraged by the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Edmund Anderson,[63]\r\nto tell the truth the wretched young man made a clean breast of all his\r\ntricks. The case against Alice Freeman, the accused, was dismissed, and\r\nSir Edmund, shocked at the frauds, wrote a weighty letter to Whitgift,\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury. Darrel and More were cited to the Court of\r\nHigh Commission, where Bancroft, Bishop of London, two of the Lord Chief\r\nJustices, the Master of Requests, and other high officials heard the\r\ncase. It is obvious that Bancroft really controlled the examination from\r\nfirst to last, and that he combined the rôles of prosecutor and judge.\r\nSomers now told the Court how he had been in constant communication with\r\nDarrel, how they had met secretly when Darrel taught him “to doe all\r\nthose trickes which Katherine Wright did” and later sent him to see and\r\nlearn of the boy of Burton. In fact Darrel made him go through a whole\r\nseries of antics again and again in his presence, and it was after all\r\nthese preliminaries and practice that the lad posed as a possessed person\r\nat Nottingham and was prayed over and exhibited. The vulpine Puritan\r\nwas fairly caught. No doubt the Bishop of London may have been a trifle\r\narbitrary, but after all he was dealing with a rank impostor. Darrel and\r\nMore were deposed from the ministry, and committed to close prison.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this case is reported by Samuel Harsnett, chaplain to\r\nBancroft, in a book of three hundred and twenty-four pages, _A Discovery\r\nof the Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel, Bacheler of Artes_....\r\nLondon, 1599, and a perfect rain of pamphlets followed. Both Darrel and\r\nMore answered Harsnett, drawing meantime a number of other persons into\r\nthe paper fray. We have such works as _An Apologie, or defence of the\r\npossession of William Sommers, a young man of the towne of Nottingham....\r\nBy John Darrell, Minister of Christ Jesus_ ... a black letter brochure\r\nwhich is undated but may be safely assigned to 1599; _The Triall of\r\nMaist. Dorrel, or A Collection of Defences against Allegations_ ...\r\n1599;[64] and Darrel’s abusive _A Detection of that sinnful, shamful,\r\nlying, and ridiculous discours of Samuel Harshnet_, 1600. There are\r\nseveral allusions in contemporary dramatists to the scandal, and Jonson\r\nin _The Divell is an Asse_, acted in 1616, V, 3, has:\r\n\r\n    It is the easiest thing, Sir, to be done.\r\n    As plaine as fizzling: roule but wi’ your eyes,\r\n    And foame at th’ mouth. A little castle-soape\r\n    Will do’t, to rub your lips: And then a nutshell,\r\n    With toe and touchwood in it to spit fire,\r\n    Did you ner’e read, Sir, little _Darrel’s_ tricks,\r\n    With the boy o’ _Burton_, and the 7 in _Lancashire_,\r\n    Sommers at _Nottingham_? All these do teach it.\r\n    And wee’l give out, Sir, that your wife ha’s bewitch’d you.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that in his books Harsnett is to a large extent the\r\nmouthpiece of the ideas of Bancroft,[65] whose opinions must have\r\ncarried no small weight seeing that in 1604 he became Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. But Harsnett himself was also a man who could well stand\r\nalone, a divine marked out for the highest preferments. As Master of\r\nPembroke Hall, Cambridge, Vice-chancellor of that University, Bishop\r\nof Chichester, Bishop of Norwich, and finally in 1628 Archbishop of\r\nYork,[66] he was certainly one of the most prominent men of the day. His\r\nviews, therefore, are not only of interest, but may be regarded as an\r\nexpression of recognized Anglican authority. Bancroft, who was a bitter\r\npersecutor of Catholics, seems to have turned over a quantity of material\r\nhe had collected to Harsnett, who in 1603 published a verjuiced attack\r\nupon the priesthood in particular and upon the supernatural in general\r\nunder the title of _A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures_.[67]\r\nThis violent and foolish polemic with its heavy periods of coarse\r\nill-humour and scornful profanity jars upon the reader like the harsh\r\nscreeching of some cankered scold. True, it has a certain force due to\r\nthe very vehemence and elaborate gusto of the wrathful ecclesiastic,\r\nthe force of Billingsgate and deafening vituperation bawled by leathern\r\nlungs and raucous tongue. As a sober argument, a reasoned contribution\r\nto controversy and debate, the thing is negligible and has been wholly\r\nforgotten. Nevertheless, historically Harsnett and Bancroft are\r\nimportant, for it was the latter who drew up, or at least inspired,\r\ncarried through Convocation, and at once enforced the Canons generally\r\nknown as those of 1604, of which number 72 lays down: “No minister or\r\nministers shall ... without the license or direction (_mandatum_) of the\r\nBishop ... attempt upon any pretence whatsoever either of possession or\r\nobsession, by fasting or prayer, to cast out any devil or devils, under\r\npain of the imputation of imposture or cozenage, and deposition from the\r\nministry.”\r\n\r\nThis article seems definitely intended to fix the position of the\r\nChurch of England.[68] The whole question of exorcism had, in common\r\nwith every other point of Christian doctrine, caused the most acrid\r\ndisagreement. The Lutherans retained exorcism in the baptismal rite and\r\nwere both instant and persevering in their exorcisms of the possessed.\r\nMartin Luther himself had a most vivid realization of and the firmest\r\nbelief in the material antagonism of evil. The black stain in the castle\r\nof Wartburg still marks the room where he flung his ink-horn at the\r\nDevil. The silly body, the blind, the dumb, the idiot, were, as often\r\nas not, afflicted by demons; the raving maniac was assuredly possessed.\r\nPhysicians might explain these evils as natural infirmity, but such\r\nphysicians were ignorant men; they did not know the craft and power of\r\nSatan. Many a poor wretch who was generally supposed to have committed\r\nsuicide had in truth been seized by the Fiend and strangled by him.\r\nThe Devil could beget children; had not Luther himself come in contact\r\nwith one of them?[69] At the close of the sixteenth century, however,\r\nan interminable and desperate struggle took place between the believers\r\nin exorcism and the Swiss and Silesian sectaries who entirely discarded\r\nexorcism,[70] either declaring it to have belonged only to the earliest\r\nyears of Christianity or else trying to explain away the Biblical\r\ninstances on purely rationalistic grounds. In England baptismal exorcism\r\nwas retained in the First Prayer Book of 1549, but by 1552, owing to\r\nthe authority of Martin Bucer, we find it entirely eliminated. Under\r\nElizabeth the ever-increasing influence of Zurich and Geneva, to which\r\ncompletest deference was paid, thoroughly discredited exorcisms of any\r\nkind, and this misbelieving attitude is repeatedly and amply made clear\r\nin the sundry “Apologies” and “Defences” of Jewel and his followers.\r\n\r\nA letter of Archbishop Parker in 1574[71] with reference to the proven\r\nfrauds of two idle wenches, Agnes Bridges and Rachel Pinder,[72] shows\r\nthat he was thoroughly sceptical as to the possibility of possession, and\r\nhis successor, the stout old Calvinist Whitgift, was certainly of the\r\nsame mind.\r\n\r\nIn 1603 five clergymen attempted exorcism in the case of Mary Glover, the\r\ndaughter of a merchant in Thames Street, who was said to be possessed\r\nowing to the sorceries of a certain Elizabeth Jackson. John Swan, “a\r\nfamous Minister of the Gospel,” took the lead in this business, which\r\nmade considerable noise at the time. The Puritans were not unnaturally\r\nanxious to vindicate their powers over the Devil and they seem avidly\r\nto have grasped at any such opportunity that offered. Swan did not fail\r\nto advertise his supposed triumph in _A True and Breife Report of Mary\r\nGlover’s Vexation and of her deliverance by the meanes of fastinge and\r\nprayer_, 1603; moreover, after her deliverance he took her home to be\r\nhis servant “least Satan should assault her again.” Old Mother Jackson\r\nwas indicted, committed by Sir John Crook, the Recorder of London, and\r\nactually sentenced by Sir Edmund Anderson, the Lord Chief Justice, to\r\nbe pilloried four times and be kept a year in prison. Unfortunately for\r\nthe would-be exorcists and their pretensions King James, whose shrewd\r\nsuspicions were aroused, sent to examine the girl, a physician, Dr.\r\nEdward Jorden, who detected her imposture, in which, I doubt not, she had\r\nbeen well coached by the Puritans. Dr. Jorden recounted the circumstance\r\nin his pamphlet _A briefe discourse of a disease called the Suffocation\r\nof the Mother, Written uppon occasion which hath beene of late taken\r\nthereby to suspect possession of an evill spirit_ (London, 1603). The\r\nministers were extremely chagrined, and one Stephen Bradwell even took up\r\nthe cudgels in a tart rejoinder to Jorden, which was singularly futile\r\nas his lucubrations remain unpublished.[73] It is not improbable that\r\nthis performance had its share of influence on Bancroft when he drew up\r\narticle 72 of the 1604 Canons.\r\n\r\nFrancis Hutchinson in his _Historical Essay on Witchcraft_ (1718)[74]\r\ndoubts whether any Bishop of the Church of England ever granted a licence\r\nfor exorcism to any one of his clergy, and indeed the case which is given\r\nby Dr. F. G. Lee,[75] who relates how Bishop Seth Ward of Exeter assigned\r\na form under his own signature and seal in January, 1665, to the Rev.\r\nJohn Ruddle, vicar of Altarnon, is probably unique. And even so, this\r\nwas not strictly speaking an instance of exorcism, at least there was no\r\ndeliverance of a person possessed. Mr. Ruddle records in his MS. Diary\r\nthat in a lonely field belonging to the parish of Little Petherick[76]\r\nan apparition was seen by a lad aged about sixteen, the son of a certain\r\nMr. Bligh. The ghost, which was that of one Dorothy Durant, who had died\r\neight years before, appeared so frequently to the boy at this same spot\r\nwhich he was obliged to pass daily as he went to and from school, that\r\nhe fell ill and at last confessed his fears to his family, who treated\r\nthe matter with ridicule and scolded him roundly when they saw that jest\r\nand mockery were of no avail. Eventually Mr. Ruddle was sent for to argue\r\nhim out of his foolishness. The vicar, however, was not slow to perceive\r\nthat young Bligh was speaking the truth, and he forthwith accompanied his\r\npupil to the field, where they both unmistakably saw the phantom just as\r\nhad been described. After a little while Mr. Ruddle visited Exeter to\r\ninterview his diocesan and obtain the necessary licence for the exorcism.\r\nThe Bishop, however, asked: “On what authority do you allege that I am\r\nentrusted with faculty so to do? Our Church, as is well known, hath\r\nabjured certain branches of her ancient power, on grounds of perversion\r\nand abuse.” Mr. Ruddle quoted the Canons of 1604, and this appears to\r\nhave satisfied the prelate, who called in his secretary and assigned a\r\nform “insomuch that the matter was incontinently done.” But the worthy\r\nvicar was not permitted to depart without a thoroughly characteristic\r\ncaution: “Let it be secret, Mr. Ruddle,—weak brethren! weak brethren!”\r\nThe MS. Diary gives some details of the manner in which the ghost was\r\nlaid, and it is significant to read that the operator described a circle\r\nand a pentacle upon the ground further making use of a rowan “crutch”\r\nor wand. He mentions “a parchment scroll,” he spoke in Syriac and\r\nproceeded to demand as the books advise; he “went through the proper\r\nforms of dismissal and fulfilled all, as it was set down and written in\r\nmy memoranda,” and then “with certain fixed rites I did dismiss that\r\ntroubled ghost.” It would be interesting to know what form and ceremonies\r\nthe Bishop prescribed. It does not sound like the details of a Catholic\r\nexorcism, but rather some superstitious and magical ritual. From what is\r\nrelated the form can hardly have been arranged for the nonce.\r\n\r\nAlthough exorcism was not recognized by Protestants there are instances\r\nupon record where an appeal has been made by English country-folk for\r\nthe ministrations of a Catholic priest. In April, 1815, Father Edward\r\nPeach of the Midland District, was implored to visit a young married\r\nwoman named White, of King’s Norton, Worcestershire. She had for two\r\nmonths been afflicted with an extraordinary kind of illness which doctors\r\ncould neither name nor cure. Her sister declared that a young man of bad\r\nrepute, whose hand had been rejected, had sworn revenge and had employed\r\nthe assistance of a reputed wizard at Dudley to work some mischief.\r\nHowever that might be, the unhappy girl seemed to lie at death’s door;\r\nshe raved of being beset day and night by spirits who mocked and moped\r\nat her, threatening to carry her away body and soul, and suggesting\r\nself-destruction as the only means to escape them. The clergyman of the\r\nparish visited and prayed with her, but no good resulted from all his\r\nendeavours. It so happened that a nurse who was called in was a Catholic,\r\nand horrified at the hideous ravings of the patient she procured a bottle\r\nof holy water, with which she sprinkled the room and bed. A few drops\r\nfell upon the sufferer, who uttered the most piercing cries, and screamed\r\nout, “You have scalded me! You have scalded me!” The paroxysm, however,\r\npassed, and she fell for the first time during many weeks into a sound\r\nslumber. After some slight improvement for eight and forty hours she was\r\nattacked by violent convulsions, and her relatives, in great alarm, on\r\nTuesday in Rogation Week, 2 May, 1815, sent a special messenger to beg\r\nFather Peach to come over immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen the priest appeared the girl was being held down in bed by two women\r\nwho were forced to put forth all their strength, and as soon as she saw\r\nhim—he was a complete stranger to her nor could his sacred profession\r\nbe recognized by his attire—so terrible were her struggles that her\r\nhusband was bound to lend his aid also to master her writhing limbs.\r\nPresently she fell into a state of complete exhaustion, and Father Peach,\r\ndismissing the rest of the company, was able to talk to her long and\r\nseriously. He seems to have been quite satisfied that it was a genuine\r\ncase of diabolic possession, and his evidence, carefully expressed and\r\nmarshalled with great moderation, leave no reasonable doubt that this\r\nstrange sickness owned no natural origin. In the course of conversation\r\nit appeared that she had never been baptized. A simple instruction was\r\ngiven and finding her in excellent dispositions Father Peach at once\r\nbaptized her. During the administration of this sacrament she trembled\r\nlike a leaf, and as the water fell upon her she winced pitifully, a spasm\r\nof agony distorting her countenance. She afterwards averred that it gave\r\nher as much pain as if boiling water had been poured upon her bare flesh.\r\nImmediately afterwards there followed a truly remarkable change in her\r\nhealth and spirits; her husband and sister were overjoyed and thought\r\nit no less than a miracle. The next day Father Peach visited her again\r\nand noticed a rapid improvement. Save for a slight weakness she seemed\r\nperfectly restored, and, says the good father, writing a twelvemonth\r\nlater than the event from notes he had taken at the time, there was no\r\nreturn, nor the least lingering symptom of her terrible and distressing\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\nIn its issue of 11 October, 1925, _The Sunday Express_, under the heading\r\n“Evil Spirit Haunts A Girl,” devoted a prominent column to the record of\r\nsome extraordinary happenings. The account commences:\r\n\r\n“Haunted for twelve months and more by a mischievous spirit—called a\r\nPoltergeist—driven almost to a state of distraction, threatened with a\r\nlunatic asylum, and then cured by the help of a band of spirit Indians,\r\nis the extraordinary experience of the nineteen-year-old Gwynneth Morley,\r\nwho lives with her widowed mother at Keighley, and who was employed in\r\nthe spinning mills of Messrs. Hay and Wright.”\r\n\r\nThese phenomena were communicated to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who\r\ninformed Mr. Hewet McKenzie, with the result that the girl was brought\r\nto London for psychic treatment, Mr. McKenzie being “honorary principal\r\nof the British College of Psychic Science,” an institution which is\r\nadvertised as the “Best equipped Centre for the study of Psychic\r\nScience in Britain,” and announces “Lectures on Practical Healing,”\r\n“Public Clairvoyance,” “A Small Exhibition of notable water colours ...\r\nrepresenting Soul development, or experience of the Soul in ethereal\r\nconditions.” “The College” is, I am given to understand, a well-known\r\ncentre for spiritistic séances.\r\n\r\nGwynneth Morley worked in Mr. McKenzie’s family for three months “as a\r\nhousemaid, under close observation, and receiving psychic treatment.\r\n\r\n“Day by day the amazing manifestations of her tormenting spirit were\r\nnoted down. In between the new and full moon the disturbances were worse.\r\nEverything in the room in which Gwynneth happened to be would be thrown\r\nabout and smashed. Tables were lifted and overturned, chairs smashed to\r\npieces, bookcases upset, and heavy settees thrown over.\r\n\r\n“In the kitchen of Holland Park the preparation of meals, when Gwynneth\r\nwas about, was a disconcerting affair. Bowls of water would be spilt and\r\npats of butter thrown on the floor.\r\n\r\n“On another occasion when Gwynneth was in the kitchen the housekeeper,\r\nwho was preparing some grape fruit for breakfast, found that one half\r\nhad disappeared and could be found neither in the kitchen nor in the\r\nscullery. She got two bananas to take its place, and laid them on the\r\ntable beside her; immediately the missing grape fruit whizzed past her\r\near and fell before her and the bananas vanished. Some ten minutes later\r\nthey were found on the scullery table.\r\n\r\n“All this time Gwynneth was being treated by psychic experts. Every week\r\nthe girl sat with Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie and others. It was found that she\r\nwas easily hypnotised, and that tables moved towards her in the circle.\r\n\r\n“At other times during the cure the Poltergeist seemed to accept\r\nchallenges. One night after a particularly exciting day, Mrs. Barkel\r\nmagnetised her head and quietened her, and Mrs. McKenzie suggested that\r\nshe should go to bed, saying ‘Nothing happens when you get into bed.’\r\nGoing up the stairs a small table and a metal vase crashed over, and a\r\nlittle later a great noise of banging and tearing was heard in Gwynneth’s\r\nroom. When Mrs. McKenzie went into the room it looked as if a tornado had\r\nswept over it.\r\n\r\n“After an active spell from June 21 to June 25 the spirit behaved itself\r\nuntil July 1, when the girl had a kind of fit. Suddenly she fell off her\r\nchair with her hands clenched. They laid her on a bed, and she fell into\r\nanother fit. She gripped her own throat powerfully.\r\n\r\n“Since that evening she has had no further attacks, nor have there been\r\nany disturbances.”\r\n\r\nThe main cause of this apparent cure is said to be the mediumship of Mrs.\r\nBarkel.\r\n\r\n“On many occasions Mrs. Barkel gave Gwynneth excellent clairvoyance,\r\ndescribing deceased relatives, friends, and incidents in her past life\r\nwhich the girl acknowledged and corroborated.\r\n\r\n“One near relative, says Mr. McKenzie, whose life had been misspent,\r\nand who had been a heavy drinker, was clearly seen. The girl feared and\r\nhated this personality, in life and beyond death, and had herself often\r\nseen him clairvoyantly before the disturbances began at all. Through\r\nMrs. Barkel’s spirit guide, Mr. McKenzie got into touch with him, and\r\nhe promised to carry out any instructions that might be given for the\r\nbenefit of the girl.\r\n\r\n“The request was made that he should withdraw altogether from any contact\r\nwith her and not return except by request. ‘Professor J.,’ a worker on\r\nthe other side, became interested. Mr. McKenzie asked that a band of\r\nIndians, who sometimes profess to be able to help, should take Gwynneth\r\nin hand and protect her from the assaults of disturbing influences.\r\n\r\n“The following day Mrs. Barkel described an Indian who had come to\r\nhelp, and improvements were noted from about this date. The ‘professor’\r\nencouraged the treatment by suggestion, and told Mr. McKenzie that in a\r\nfew weeks, with the help of the Indian workers, he would place the medium\r\nin an entirely new psychic condition. Mr. McKenzie says that the promise\r\nwas kept.”\r\n\r\nI have quoted this case at some length owing to the prominence\r\nafforded it in a popular and widely read newspaper. That the facts are\r\nsubstantially true I see no reason at all to doubt. It is an ordinary\r\ninstance of obsession, and will be easily recognized as such by those\r\npriests whose duty has required them to study these distressing\r\nphenomena. That the interpretation put upon some of the occurrences is\r\nutterly false I am very certain. The clairvoyance is merely playing with\r\nfire—I might say, with hell-fire—by those who cannot understand what they\r\nare about, what forces they are thus blindly evoking. “Professor J.” and\r\n“the band of Indians,” indeed all these “workers on the other side” are\r\nnothing else than evil, or at the least gravely suspect intelligences,\r\nmasquerading as spirits of light and goodness. If, indeed, the girl is\r\nrelieved from obsession one cannot but suppose some ulterior motive lurks\r\nin the background; it is but part of a scheme organized for purposes\r\nof their own by dark and secret powers ever alert to trick and trap\r\ncredulous man. The girl, Gwynneth Morley, should have been exorcized by\r\na trained and accredited exorcist. These amateurs neither know nor even\r\nfaintly realize the harm they may do, the dangers they encounter. A bold\r\nmind, such as that of Guazzo, might specify their attempts—well-meaning\r\nas they are, no doubt—in terms I do not care to use.\r\n\r\nAt Illfurt, five miles south of Mulhausen in Alsace, is a monument\r\nconsisting of a stone column thirty feet high surmounted with a statue\r\nof the Immaculate Conception, and upon the plinth of the pillar may\r\nbe read the following remarkable inscription: _In memoriam perpetuam\r\nliberationis duorum possessorum Theobaldi et Josephi Burner, obtentæ per\r\nintercessionem Beatæ Mariæ Uirginis Immaculatæ, Anno Domini 1869_.\r\n\r\nJoseph Burner[77] and Anna Maria, his wife, were poor but intelligent\r\npersons, who were not merely respected but even looked up to for their\r\nprobity and industry by their fellow-villagers of Illfurt. The family\r\nconsisted of five children, the eldest son, Thiébaut, being born on\r\n21 August, 1855, and the second, Joseph, on 29 April, 1857. They were\r\nquiet lads of average ability, who, when eight years old, were sent\r\nin the usual course to the local elementary school. In the autumn of\r\n1864 both were seized with a mysterious illness which would not yield\r\nto the ordinary remedies. Dr. Levy, of Altkirch, who was called in to\r\nexamine the case acknowledged himself completely baffled, and a number\r\nof other doctors who were afterwards consulted declared themselves\r\nunable to diagnose such extraordinary symptoms. From 25 September,\r\n1865, the two boys displayed most abnormal phenomena. Whilst lying\r\non their backs they spun suddenly round like whirling tops with the\r\nutmost rapidity. Convulsions seized them, twisting and distorting every\r\nlimb with unparalleled mobility, or again their bodies would for hours\r\ntogether become absolutely rigid and motionless so that no joint could\r\nbe bent, whilst they lay motionless as stocks or stones. Fearful fits\r\nof vomiting often concluded these attacks. Sometimes they were dumb\r\nfor days and could only gibber and mow with blazing eyes and slabbering\r\nlips, sometimes they were deaf so that even a pistol fired close to their\r\nears had not the slightest effect.[78] Often they became fantastically\r\nexcited, gesticulating wildly and shouting incessantly. Their voices\r\nwere, however, not their normal tones nor even those of children at all,\r\nbut the strong, harsh, hoarse articulation of rough and savage men. For\r\nhours together they would blaspheme in the foulest terms, cursing and\r\nswearing, and bawling out such hideous obscenities that the neighbours\r\ntook to flight in sheer terror at the horrible scenes, whilst the\r\ndistracted parents knew not whence to turn for help or comfort. Not only\r\ndid the sufferers use the filthy vocabulary of the lowest slums, but\r\nthey likewise spoke with perfect correctness and answered fluently in\r\ndifferent languages, in French, Latin, English, and even in most varied\r\ndialects of Spanish and Italian, which could by no possible means have\r\nbeen known to them in their normal state. Nor could they at any time have\r\nheard conversation in these languages and subconsciously assimilated\r\nit. A famous case is on record where a servant girl of mean education\r\nfell ill and during a delirium began to mutter and babble in a language\r\nwhich was recognized as Syriac. This was considered to be accounted\r\nfor when it was discovered that formerly she had been in service in a\r\nhouse where there was lodging a theological student, who upon the eve\r\nof his examinations used to walk up and down stairs and pace his room\r\nsaying aloud to himself Syriac roots and vocables, which she thus often\r\noverheard and which in this way registered themselves in her brain. But\r\nthere could not be any such explanation in the case of Thiébaut and\r\nJoseph Burner, since they did not merely reel out disconnected words and\r\nphrases in any one or two tongues, but conversed easily and sensibly\r\nin a large variety of languages and even in dialects. This has always\r\nbeen considered one of the genuine signs of diabolic possession, as is\r\nstated in the third article of _De Exorcizandis Obsessis a Dæmonio_: “3.\r\nIn primis, ne facile credat, aliquem a dæmonio obsessum esse, sed nota\r\nhabeat ea signa, quibus obsessus dignoscitur ab iis, qui uel atra bile,\r\nuel morbo aliquo laborant. Signa autem obsidentis dæmonis sunt: ignota\r\nlingua loqui pluribus uerbis, uel loquentem intelligere; distantia et\r\nocculta patefacere; uires super ætatis seu conditionis naturam ostendere;\r\net id genus alia, quæ cum plurima concurrunt, maiora sunt indicia.”\r\nMoreover, both Thiébaut and Joseph Burner repeatedly and in exactest\r\ndetail described events which were happening at a distance, and upon\r\ninvestigation their accounts were afterwards found to be precisely true\r\nin every particular. Their strength was also abnormal, and often in\r\ntheir paroxysms and convulsions it needed the utmost exertions of three\r\npowerful men severally to hold these lads who were but nine and seven\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed at the very beginning of these maladies that the patients\r\nwere thrown into the most violent fits and every symptom of disease and\r\ndisorder exacerbated by the presence of any sacramental such as holy\r\nwater, or medals, rosaries, and other objects which had been blessed\r\naccording to the ritual. They seemed particularly enraged by the blessed\r\nMedal of S. Benedict and pictures of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour. On\r\none occasion Monsieur Ignace Spies, the _Maire_ of Selestat, a man of\r\nexceptional devotion and piety, held before their eyes a Relic of S.\r\nGerard Majella,[79] the Redemptorist thaumaturge, when their shrieks\r\nand yells were truly terrific, finally dying away in inhuman whines\r\nand groans of despair. It so happened that a Corpus Christi procession\r\npassed the house, opposite which an Altar of Repose had been erected. The\r\nchildren, who were in bed, knew nothing of this and seemed to lie in a\r\ndeep stupor. However, as the Blessed Sacrament approached their behaviour\r\nis said to have been indescribable. They poured forth torrents of filth\r\nand profanity, distorting their limbs into a thousand unnatural postures,\r\ntheir eyes almost starting from their heads, a crisis which was succeeded\r\nby a sudden horrible composure, whilst they crept away into the furthest\r\ncorners of the room moaning, panting, and retching as if in mortal agony.\r\nAbove all, pictures and Medals of Our Lady and the invocation of Her Most\r\nHoly Name filled the possessed with terror and rage. At any mention of\r\n“the Great Lady,” as they termed Her, they would curse and howl in so\r\nmonstrous a way that all who had heard them shook and sweated with fear.\r\n\r\nThe abbé Charles Brey, parish priest of Illfurt, quickly made up his\r\nmind as to the diabolic nature of the phenomena. It was an undoubted\r\ncase of possession, since in no other way could what was taking place\r\nbe explained. Accordingly he sent to his diocesan, Monsignor Andreas\r\nRäss (1842-87) a full account of such extraordinary and fearful events.\r\nThe Bishop, however, was far from satisfied that these things could not\r\nbe accounted for naturally. In fact it was only after three or four\r\nyears’ delay that at the instance of the Dean of Altkirch he decided to\r\norder a special ecclesiastical investigation. He finally appointed for\r\nthis task three acute theologians, Monsignor Stumpf,[80] Superior of\r\nhis Grand Seminary at Strasburg; Monsignor Freyburger, Vicar-General of\r\nthe diocese; and Monsieur Sester, rector of Mulhausen. These priests,\r\nthen, presented themselves unexpectedly at the Burner’s house on Tuesday\r\nmorning, 13 April, 1869, at 10 o’clock. It was found that Joseph Burner\r\nhad already concealed himself, and it was only after a prolonged search\r\nhe could with difficulty be dragged from under his bed where he had taken\r\nrefuge. Thiébaut feigned to be unconscious of the presence of strangers.\r\nThe inquiry lasted for more than two hours, and it was not until past\r\nnoon that the investigators left the house. Meanwhile they had witnessed\r\nthe most hideous scenes, and their minds were quite made up as to the\r\nreality of the possession. They shortly presented their report to the\r\nBishop, who then, and not until then, allowed himself to be convinced of\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nEven so, the prudent prelate ordered fresh precautions to be taken. At\r\nthe beginning of September, 1869, Thiébaut was conveyed in the company\r\nof his unhappy mother, to the orphanage of S. Charles at Schiltigheim,\r\nwhere he was to be lodged whilst the case was investigated _de nouo_\r\nby Monsignor Rapp, Monsignor Stumpf, and Father Eicher, S.J., Superior\r\nof the Jesuit house at Strasburg. At the same time Father Hausser, the\r\nchaplain of S. Charles, and Father Schrantzer, a well-known scholar and\r\npsychologist, were to keep the boy systematically but secretly under the\r\nclosest observation.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to proceed to exorcism, and a priest of great reverence\r\nand experience, Father Souquat, was commissioned by the Bishop to\r\nperform the solemn rite. At two o’clock on Sunday, 3 October, Thiébaut\r\nwas forcibly brought into the chapel of S. Charles, which hitherto he\r\nhad always sedulously avoided, and when compelled to enter he uttered\r\nwithout intermission such hoarse yells that it was necessary to remove\r\nhim for fear of scandal and alarming the other inmates. The lad,\r\nhowever, was now held fast by the abbés Schrantzer and Hausser, assisted\r\nby Charles André, the gardener of the establishment, a stalwart and\r\nmuscular Hercules. The sufferer stood upon a carpet spread just before\r\nthe communion rails, his face turned towards the tabernacle. He struggled\r\nand writhed in the grasp of those who were restraining him; his face\r\nwas scarlet; his eyes closed; whilst from his swollen and champing lips\r\nthere flowed down a stream of thick yellowish froth which fell in great\r\nviscous gouts to the floor. The Litanies began, and at the words “Sancta\r\nMaria, ora pro nobis” a hideous yell burst from his throat. The exorcizer\r\nunmoved continued the prayers and gospels of the Ritual. Meanwhile the\r\npossessed blasphemed and defied their utmost efforts. It was resolved to\r\nrecommence upon the following day. Thiébaut, accordingly, was confined\r\nin a strait jacket and strapped down in a red arm-chair, around which\r\nstood the three guards as before. The evil spirit roared and howled in\r\na deep bass voice, raising a terrific din; the boy’s limbs strained\r\nand contorted but the bonds held tight; his face was livid; his mouth\r\nflecked with the foam of slobbering saliva. In a firm voice the priest\r\nadjured the demon; he held the crucifix before his eyes, and finally a\r\nstatue of Our Lady with the words: “Unclean spirit, disappear before\r\nthe face of the Immaculate Conception! She commands! Thou must obey!\r\nThou must depart!” The assistants upon their knees fervently recited the\r\n_Memorare_, when the air was rent by a yell of hideous agony, the boy’s\r\nlimbs were convulsed in one sharp convulsion, and suddenly he lay still\r\nwrapped in a deep slumber. At the end of about an hour he awoke gently\r\nand gazed about him with wondering eyes. “Where am I?” he asked. “Do you\r\nnot know me?” questioned the abbé Schrantzer. “No, father, I do not,” was\r\nthe reply. In a few days Thiébaut was able to return home, worn and weak\r\nbut bright and happy. Of all that happened during those fateful years\r\nhe had not the smallest recollection. He returned to school, and was in\r\nevery respect a normal healthy boy.\r\n\r\nJoseph, who had grown steadily worse, was meantime secluded from his\r\nbrother, pending the preparations for his exorcism. On 27 October he was\r\ntaken very early in the morning to the cemetery chapel near Illfurt.\r\nOnly the parents, Mons. Ignace Spies, Professor Lachemann, and some half\r\na dozen more witnesses were present, as the affair was conducted in the\r\nutmost privacy. At six o’clock the abbé Charles Brey said Mass, after\r\nwhich he exorcized the unhappy victim. During three successive hours\r\nthey renewed prayers and adjurations, until at last some present began\r\nto feel discouraged. But the glowing faith of the priest sustained them,\r\nand at length with a loud groan that sounded like a deep roar the boy,\r\nwho had been struggling and screeching in paroxysms of frantic fury all\r\nthe while, fell back into a deep swoon and lay motionless. After no long\r\npause he sat up, opened his eyes as awaking from sleep, and was overcome\r\nwith amazement to find himself in a church with strange people around him.\r\n\r\nNeither Thiébaut nor Joseph ever experienced any recurrence of this\r\nstrange malady. The former died when he was only sixteen years old on 3\r\nApril, 1871. The latter, who obtained a situation at Zillisheim, died\r\nthere in 1882 at the age of twenty-five.\r\n\r\nAn even more recent case of possession, which has been authoritatively\r\nstudied in minutest detail and at first hand, presents many of the same\r\nfeatures.[81] Hélène-Joséphine Poirier, the daughter of an artisan\r\nfamily—her father was a mason—was born on 5 November, 1834, at Coullons,\r\na small village some ten miles from Gien in the district of the Loire.\r\nWhilst still young she was apprenticed to Mlle Justine Beston, a working\r\ndressmaker, and soon became skilful with her needle and a remarkable\r\nembroideress. Already she had attracted attention by her sincere and\r\nmodest piety, and was thought highly of by the parish priest, M.\r\nPreslier, a man of unusual discernment and the soundest common sense.\r\nOn the night of 25 March, 1850, she was suddenly awakened by a series\r\nof sharp raps, which soon became violent blows, as if struck upon the\r\nwalls of the small attic where she slept. In terror she rushed into her\r\nparents’ room next door, and they returned with her to search. Nothing\r\nat all could be discovered, and she was persuaded to go back to bed.\r\nAlthough they could actually see no cause for alarm her parents had heard\r\nthe extraordinary noises. “From this date,” says M. Preslier, “the life\r\nof Hélène in the midst of such terrible physical and moral suffering that\r\nshe might well have given utterance to the complaints of holy Job.”[82]\r\n\r\nThese manifestations to Hélène Poirier may not unfittingly be compared\r\nwith the famous “Rochester knockings,” the phenomenon of the rappings\r\nat Hydesville in 1848 at the house of the Fox family, which by many\r\nwriters is considered to be the beginning of that world-wide movement\r\nknown as Spiritism or Spiritualism in its modern manifestations and\r\nrecrudescence.[83]\r\n\r\nSome months after this event Hélène suddenly fell rigid to the ground as\r\nif she had been thrown down by some strong hands. She was able to get\r\nup immediately but only to fall again. It was thought she was epileptic\r\nor at any rate seized with some unusual attack, some fit or convulsion.\r\nBut after a careful observation of her case Dr. Azéma, the local\r\npractitioner, shrewdly remarked: “Nobody here but the Priest can cure\r\nyou.” From this time disorders of spirit and physical maladies increased\r\nwith unprecedented rapidity and violence. “Her physical and mental\r\nsufferings, which began on 25 March, 1850, continued until her death on\r\n8 January, 1914, that is to say during a period of sixty-four years.\r\nBut those of diabolic origin ceased towards the end of 1897. So the\r\ndiabolic attacks actually lasted for some seven-and-forty years, and for\r\nsix years of this time she was possessed.”[84] It was in January, 1863,\r\nit first became undeniably evident that her sufferings, her spasms, and\r\npainful trances had a supernatural origin. The abbé Bougaud, Archdeacon\r\nof Orleans, having interviewed her, advised that she should be brought\r\nto the Bishop, Monsignor Dupanloup, and made arrangements for her to\r\nstay at a Visitation convent in the suburbs, promising that a commission\r\nof theologians and doctors should examine her case. On Thursday, 28\r\nOctober, 1865, Hélène accordingly commenced a retreat at the convent,\r\nwhere she was kindly received. M. Bougaud saw her for about two minutes,\r\nand she was handed an official order which would allow her access to the\r\nBishop without waiting for a summons from his lordship or any other\r\nundue delay. But there was some misunderstanding, for on the Friday a\r\ndoctor of high repute called at the convent, as he had been requested,\r\ninterrogated and examined her for some three-quarters of an hour and then\r\nroundly informed the Mother Superior that she was mad, stark mad, and\r\nhad better be sent home at once. He seems to have impressed the Bishop\r\nwith his report, for Monsignor Dupanloup sent a messenger to direct the\r\nnuns to dismiss her forthwith, and accordingly she was perforce taken\r\nback to Coullons after a fruitless journey of bitter disappointments and\r\ndiscouragement. Many persons now began to regard her with suspicion, but\r\nin the following year, 1866, the Bishop, whilst visiting Coullons for\r\nan April confirmation, granted her an interview which caused him very\r\nconsiderably to modify his first opinion, and M. Bougaud, who saw her in\r\nSeptember, declared himself convinced of the supernatural origin of the\r\nsymptoms she displayed.\r\n\r\nThe most terrible obsessions now attacked her, and more than once she\r\nwas driven to the verge of suicide and despair. “From 25 March, 1850,\r\nuntil March, 1868, Hélène was _only obsessed_. This obsession _lasted 18\r\nyears_. At the end of this time she was _both obsessed and possessed_ for\r\n13 months. From this double agony of obsession and possession she was\r\ncompletely delivered by the exorcisms, which the Bishop had sanctioned,\r\nat Orleans, on 19 April, 1869. Four months’ peace followed, until with\r\nheroic generosity she voluntarily submitted to new inflictions.\r\n\r\n“At the end of August, 1869, she accepted from the hands of Our Lord\r\nthe agony of a new obsession and possession in order to obtain the\r\nconversion of the famous general Ducrot. When he was converted, she was\r\ndelivered from her torments at Lourdes on 3 September, 1875, the cure\r\nbeing effected by the prayers of 15,000 pilgrims who had assembled there.\r\n_The obsession and possession in their new form_ had lasted five years.\r\nDuring the forty years which passed before her death, she was never again\r\nsubject to possession, but she was continually obsessed, the attacks now\r\nbeing of short duration, now long and severe. The sufferings of every\r\nkind which she endured as well she offered with the intention of the\r\ntriumph and good estate of God’s priests. Why she was originally thus\r\npersecuted by the Devil for nineteen years, and with what intention she\r\noffered those torments from which she was delivered by the exorcisms\r\ndirected by the Bishop, must always remain a secret.”[85] On Tuesday,\r\n13 August, 1867, a supernormal impulse came over her to write a paper\r\nfull of the most hideous blasphemies against Our Lord and His Blessed\r\nMother, and, what is indeed significant, to draw blood from her arm and\r\nto sign therewith a deed giving herself over body and soul to Satan.\r\nThis she happily resisted after a terrible struggle. Upon the following\r\n28 August reliable witnesses saw her levitated from the ground on two\r\ndistinct occasions. With this phenomenon we may compare the levitation\r\nof mediums at spiritistic séances. Sir William Crookes in _The Quarterly\r\nJournal of Science_, January, 1874, states that “There are at least a\r\nhundred recorded instances of Mr. Home’s rising from the ground.” Of the\r\nsame medium he writes: “On three separate occasions have seen him raised\r\ncompletely from the floor of the room.”\r\n\r\nIn March, 1868, it became evident that the poor sufferer was actually\r\npossessed. Fierce convulsive fits seized her; she suddenly fell with\r\na maniacal fury and a deep hoarse voice uttered the most astounding\r\nblasphemies; if the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary were spoken in her\r\npresence she gnashed her teeth and literally foamed at the mouth; she was\r\nunable to hear the words _Et caro Uerbum factum est_ without an access\r\nof insane rage which spent itself in wild gestures and an incoherent\r\nhowling. She was interrogated in Latin, and answered the questions\r\nvolubly and easily in the same tongue. The case attracted considerable\r\nattention, and was reported by the Comte de Maumigny to Padre Picivillo,\r\nthe editor of the _Civiltá Cattolica_, who gave an account thereof to the\r\nHoly Father. The saintly Pius IX[86] showed himself full of sympathy, and\r\neven sent through the Comte de Maumigny a message of most salutary advice\r\nrecommending great caution and the avoidance of all kinds of curiosity or\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1869, when interrogated by several priests Hélène gave most\r\nextraordinary details concerning bands of Satanists. “In order to gain\r\nadmission it is necessary to bring one or more consecrated Hosts, and to\r\ndeliver these to the Devil, who in a materialized form visibly presides\r\nover the assembly. The neophyte is obliged to profane the Sacred Species\r\nin a most horrible manner, to worship the Devil with humblest adoration,\r\nand to perform with him and the other persons present the most bestial\r\nacts of unbridled obscenity, the foulest copulations. Three towns, Paris,\r\nRome, and Tours, are the headquarters of the Satanic bands.”[87] She also\r\nspoke of a gang of devil-worshippers at Toulouse. It is obvious that a\r\nmere peasant woman could have no natural knowledge of these abominations,\r\nthe details concerning which were unhappily only too true.\r\n\r\nIn the following April Hélène was taken to Orleans to be examined and\r\nsolemnly exorcized. The interrogatories were conducted by Monsieur\r\nDesbrosses, a consultor in theology for the diocese, Monsieur Bougaud,\r\nand Monsieur Mallet, Superior of the Grand Seminary. They witnessed the\r\nmost terrible crisis; the sufferer was tortured by fierce cramps and\r\nspasms; she howled like a wild beast; but they persisted patiently.\r\nMons. Mallet questioned her on difficult and obscure points in theology\r\nand philosophy using now Latin, now Greek. She replied fluently in\r\nboth tongues, answering his queries concisely, clearly, and to the\r\npoint, incontestable proof that she was influenced by some supernormal\r\npower. Two or three days later the Bishop was present at a similar\r\nexamination, and forthwith commissioned his own director, Monsieur Roy,\r\na professor at the Seminary, to undertake the exorcisms. With him were\r\nassociated Monsieur Mallet, the parish priest of Coullons, and Monsieur\r\nGaduel, Vicar-General of the diocese. Two nuns and Mlle Preslier held\r\nthe patient. It was found necessary to repeat the rite five times upon\r\nsuccessive days. On the last occasion the cries of the unhappy Hélène\r\nwere fearful to hear. She writhed and foamed in paroxysms of rage; she\r\nblasphemed and cursed God, calling loudly upon the fiends of hell;\r\nshe broke free from all restraint, hurling chairs and furniture in\r\nevery direction with the strength of five men; it was with the utmost\r\ndifficulty she could be seized and restrained before some serious\r\nmischief was done; at last with an unearthly yell, twice repeated, her\r\nlimbs relaxed, and after a short period of insensibility she seemed to\r\nawake, calm and composed, as if from a restful slumber. The possession\r\nhad lasted thirteen months from March, 1868, to April, 1869.\r\n\r\nInto the details of her second possession from 23 August, 1869, until 3\r\nSeptember, 1874, it is hardly necessary to enter at any length. Monsieur\r\nPreslier noted: “The second crisis of possession was infinitely more\r\nterrible than the first; 1st, owing to the length; the first lasted\r\nthirteen months, the second five years. 2nd, the first was relieved with\r\na number of heavenly consolations, but very little solace was obtained\r\nduring the second. 3rd, there was much bodily suffering in the first, in\r\nthe second there were far keener mental sufferings and more exquisite\r\npain.”[88] She was finally and completely delivered at Lourdes on\r\nThursday, 3 September, 1874. It is not to be supposed that she passed the\r\nremaining forty years of her life without occasional manifestations of\r\nextraordinary phenomena. After much sickness, cheerfully and smilingly\r\nborne, she made a good end in her eightieth year, on 8 January, 1914, and\r\nis buried in the little village cemetery of her native place.\r\n\r\nWe have here the case of a woman who was mediumistic and clairvoyant\r\nto an almost unexampled degree, and it is very certain that if these\r\nwould-be fortune-tellers and mages who so freely advertise their powers\r\nin many spiritistic journals to-day truly realized to what terrible\r\ndangers and very real psychic perils the use and even the mere possession\r\nof such faculties expose them, they would, so far from trafficking in\r\nthe presumption of abnormal gifts, regard them with caution and indeed\r\nshrink from any occult practice at all, lest haply they become the prey\r\nof controls and influences so cunning, so potent for evil, as to merge\r\nthem body and soul in untold miseries and shadows darker even than the\r\nbitterness of death.\r\n\r\nThe modern Spiritistic movement, so strongly supported by recent\r\nscientific utterances, is increasingly affecting all classes and\r\nconditions of society, and is beginning in every direction to undermine\r\nand actually to usurp the religious belief and convictions of thousands\r\nof earnest and seriously inclined but not very accurately informed or\r\nwell-instructed persons. The basis of the movement is the claim that the\r\nspirits of the dead are continually seeking to communicate and, indeed,\r\ncommunicating with us through the agency of sensitives, so that it is\r\npossible to get into touch and to converse with our dear ones who have\r\npassed from this life. It is hardly necessary to emphasize the almost\r\ninfinite consolation and comfort such a doctrine holds for the bereaved,\r\nhow eagerly and with what yearning mourners will embrace such teaching,\r\nand how perseveringly and with what tender agonies of an hungered love\r\nthey will devote themselves to the practices they imagine will place\r\nthem in closest connexion and communion with those whom they have lost\r\nawhile, but whose voices they ever long to hear, whose faces they long\r\nto see once again. It is a matter of common knowledge that during and\r\nsince the Great War Spiritism has increased tenfold; many who were wont\r\nto laugh at it, who refused to listen to its claims and scorned it as\r\nfutile nonsense, are now among its most enthusiastic devotees. In truth\r\nthere must be few of us who cannot appreciate the irresistible influence\r\nsuch beliefs will have upon the mind. Spiritism is seemingly full of joy,\r\nand hope, and promise, and happiness. It will wipe all tears of sorrow\r\nfrom poor human eyes; it is balm to the wounded heart; divine solace and\r\nsympathy; the barriers of death are broken down; mortality is robbed of\r\nits terrors.\r\n\r\nWere it true, could we summon to our side the spirits of those whom\r\nwe have so fondly cherished and converse with them of things holy and\r\neternal, could we learn wisdom from their fuller knowledge, could we be\r\nassured in their own sweet accents of their fadeless love, could we now\r\nand again be comforted with a sight of their well-known faces, the touch\r\nof their hands upon ours, were it God’s will that this should be so, then\r\nassuredly Spiritism is a most blessed and sacred thing, consolation to\r\nthe afflicted, succour to the distressed, a shining light upon earth’s\r\ndark ways, a very ready help to us all. But if on the other hand there\r\nis reason and grave reason to suppose that the spirits, with whom it is\r\npossible under certain exceptional conditions and by certain remarkable\r\ndevices to establish a contact, although often claiming to be departed\r\nfriends or relatives and supporting their contention (we acknowledge)\r\nwith no little plausibility, are again and again found to be masquerading\r\nintelligences, in some cases undoubtedly actors of excellence who play\r\ntheir part for a time with consummate skill, but who have never at any\r\nséance whatsoever anywhere been able conclusively to demonstrate their\r\nidentity, if in fact these manifesting intelligences are deceivers,\r\nimposing for purposes of their own a fraudulent impersonation upon those\r\nwho with breaking hearts are so eagerly longing to communicate with son\r\nor husband fallen in battle, it may be, or on some lone shore, if they\r\nare proven liars, if their messages are trivial, ambiguous, cryptic,\r\nincapable of verification, shifty, ignorant, nay worse, blasphemous and\r\nhideously obscene, then are we justified—and we are in point of fact\r\nfully and completely justified—in concluding that the spirits are not\r\nthose of the departed, but evil intelligences who never have been and\r\nnever will be incarnate, unclean spirits, demons, and then assuredly\r\nSpiritism is most foul, most loathly, most dangerous, and most damnable.\r\n\r\nThe mediums, who of their own will freely open the door to these spirits,\r\nwho invite them to enter, stand in the most deadly peril. A Spiritist of\r\nmany years’ experience who saw not too late the hazard and abandoned that\r\ncreed, writes as follows: “Spirit communion soon absorbs all the time,\r\nfaculties, hopes, fears, and desires of its devotees, and herein lies one\r\nof the greatest dangers of spiritualism. Infatuated by communication with\r\nthe unseen inhabitants of the hidden world, the medium loses his or her\r\ninterest in the things pertaining to everyday life and interest. A soft\r\nand pleasing atmosphere appears to surround them. The realities of flesh\r\nand blood are lost in ideal dreaming and there is no incentive to break\r\naway from a state of existence so agreeable, no matter how monstrous are\r\nthe delusions practised by the spirits. Their consciences are so callous\r\nas if seared with a hot iron, sin has to them lost its wickedness, and\r\nthey are willing dupes to unseen beings who delight to control their\r\nevery faculty. Very seldom has a full-fledged spiritualist been able to\r\ncomprehend the necessity and blessedness of the religion of Jesus Christ,\r\nand to withdraw from the morbid conditions into which he has fallen....\r\n\r\n“For about three months I was in the power of spirits, having a\r\ndual existence, and greatly tormented by their contradictory and\r\nunsatisfactory operations.... They tormented me to a very severe extent,\r\nand I desired to be freed from them. I lost much of my confidence in\r\nthem, and their blasphemy and uncleanness shocked me. But they were\r\nmy constant companions. I could not get rid of them. They tempted me\r\nto suicide and murder, and to other sins. I was fearfully beset and\r\nbewildered and deluded. There was no human help for me. They led me\r\ninto some extravagances of action, and to believe, in a measure, a few\r\nof their delusions, often combining religion and devilry in a most\r\nsurprising manner.”[89]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII\r\n\r\nS. JAMES VISITS THE WARLOCK’S DEN. Breughel\r\n\r\n[_face p. 250_]\r\n\r\nIn my own experience, I myself, not once, but over and over again, have\r\nseen all these symptoms unmistakably marked in those whose sole interest\r\nand aim in life seemed to be a constant attendance at séances. I have\r\nwatched, in spite of every effort unable to check and dissuade, the\r\nfearfully rapid development of such characteristics in persons who have\r\nbegun to dabble with Spiritism, at first no doubt in moods of levity\r\nand wanton curiosity, but soon with hectic anxiety and the most morbid\r\nabsorption. Some fifteen years ago in a well-known English provincial\r\ntown a circle was formed by a number of friends to experiment with\r\ntable-turning, psychometry, the planchette, ouija-boards, crystal-gazing,\r\nand the like. They were, perhaps, a little tired of the usual round\r\nof social engagements, dances, concerts, bridge, the theatre, dinner\r\nparties, and all those mildly pleasurable businesses which go to make\r\nup life, or at least a great portion of life, for so many. They wanted\r\nsome new excitement, something a little out of the ordinary. A lady,\r\njust returned home from a prolonged visit to London, had (it seems) been\r\ntaken to some Spiritistic meeting, and she was full of the wonders both\r\nwitnessed and heard there. The sense of the eerie, the unknown, lent a\r\nspice of adventure too. The earlier meetings were informal, first at one\r\nhouse, now at another. They began by being infrequent, almost casual, at\r\nfairly long intervals. Next a certain evening each week was fixed for\r\nthese gatherings, which soon were fully attended by all concerned. No\r\nmember would willingly miss a single reunion. Before long they met twice,\r\nthree times, every evening in the week. Professional mediums were engaged\r\nwho travelled down from London and other great cities, some at no small\r\ndistance, to give strange exhibitions of their powers. I myself met two\r\nof these experts, a man and a woman, both of whose names I have since\r\nseen advertised in Spiritistic journals of a very recent date, and I am\r\nbound to say that I was most unfavourably impressed in each instance.\r\nNot that I for a moment think they were fraudulent, nor do I suspect\r\nany vulgar trickery or pose; they were undoubtedly honest, thoroughly\r\nconvinced and sincere, which makes the matter ten times worse. And so\r\nfrom being mere idle triflers at a new game, incredulous and a little\r\nmocking, the whole company became besotted by their practices, fanatics\r\nwhose thoughts were always and ever centred and concentrated upon their\r\ncommunion with spirits, who talked of nothing else, who seemed only to\r\nlive for those evenings when they might meet and enter—as it were—another\r\nworld. Argument, pleading, reproof, authority, official admonishment,\r\nall proved useless; one could only stand by and see the terrible thing\r\ndoing its deadly work. The symptoms were exactly as above described. In\r\ntwo cases, men, the moral fibre was for a while apparently destroyed\r\naltogether; in another case, a woman, there was obsession, and persons\r\nwho either knew nothing of, or had no sort of belief in, Spiritism,\r\nwhispered of eccentricities, of outbursts of uncontrolled passion and\r\nravings, which pointed to a disordered mind, to an asylum. All sank into\r\na state of apathy; former interests vanished; the amenities of social\r\nintercourse were neglected and forgotten; old friendships allowed to\r\ndrop for no reason whatsoever; a complete change of character for the\r\nworse, a terrible deterioration took place; the physical health suffered;\r\ntheir faces became white and drawn, the eyes dull and glazed, save\r\nwhen Spiritism was discussed, and then they lit with hot unholy fires;\r\none heard covert gossip that hinted of crude debauch, of blasphemous\r\nspeeches, of licence and degradation. Fortunately by a series of\r\nprovidential events the circle was broken up; outside circumstances\r\ncompelled the principals to fall away, and what was doubtless a more\r\npotent factor than any, one or two were suddenly brought to realize\r\nthe deadly peril and the folly of their proceedings. It proved a hard\r\nstruggle indeed to rid themselves of the controls to which they had\r\nso blindly and so utterly submitted; their wills were weakened, their\r\nhealth impaired; more than once they slid back again into the old danger\r\nzone, more than once they were on the verge of giving up the contest in\r\ndespair. But under direction and availing themselves of those means of\r\ngrace the Church so bounteously proffers they persevered, and were at\r\nlength made clean.\r\n\r\nThere must be many who have had similar experiences, who know intimately,\r\neven if they have not actually had to rescue and to guide, those who have\r\nbeen meshed and trapped by Spiritism and are endeavouring to escape.\r\nThey will appreciate how difficult is the task, they will realize how\r\npernicious, how potent, how evil, such toils may be. Nobody who has had\r\nto deal with sensitives, with poor dupes who are eager to abandon their\r\npractices, can think lightly of Spiritism.\r\n\r\nThat Spiritism opens the door to demoniac possession, so often classed\r\nas lunacy, is generally acknowledged by all save the prejudiced and\r\nsuperstitious. As far back as 1877 Dr. L. S. Forbes Winslow wrote in\r\n_Spiritualistic Madness_: “Ten thousand unfortunate people are at the\r\npresent time confined in lunatic asylums on account of having tampered\r\nwith the supernatural.” And quoting an American journal he goes on to\r\nsay: “Not a week passes in which we do not hear that some of these\r\nunfortunates destroy themselves by suicide, or are removed to a lunatic\r\nasylum. The mediums often manifest signs of an abnormal condition of\r\ntheir mental faculties, and among certain of them are found unequivocal\r\nindications of a true demoniacal possession. The evil spreads rapidly,\r\nand it will produce in a few years frightful results.... Two French\r\nauthors of spiritualistic works, who wrote _Le Monde Spirituel_ and\r\n_Sauvons le genre humain_, died insane in an asylum; these two men were\r\ndistinguished in their respective professions; one as a highly scientific\r\nman, the other as an advocate well learned in the Law. These individuals\r\nplaced themselves in communication with spirits by means of tables. I\r\ncould quote many such instances where men of the highest ability have, so\r\nto speak, neglected all and followed the doctrines of Spiritualism only\r\nto end their days in the lunatic asylum.”\r\n\r\nSome half a dozen years ago an inquiry was undertaken and there was\r\ncirculated an interrogatory or _enquête_ which invited opinions upon (1)\r\n“the situation as regards the renewed interest in psychic phenomena”;\r\n(2) whether this “psychic renewal” denoted a “passing from a logical and\r\nscientific (deductive) to a spiritual and mystic (inductive) conception\r\nof life,” or “a reconciliation between the two, that is between science\r\nand faith”;[90] (3) “the most powerful argument for, or against, human\r\nsurvival”; (4) “the best means of organizing this (psychic) movement in\r\nthe highest interest, philosophical, religious and scientific, of the\r\nnation, especially as a factor of durable peace.” Five-and-fifty of the\r\nanswers were collected and published under the title _Spiritualism: Its\r\nPresent-Day Meaning_,[91] a book which certainly makes most interesting\r\nand illuminating if extremely varied reading. Being a symposium, all\r\nschools of thought are represented, and I would venture to add that among\r\nthe contributions are some outpourings which evince no thought at all, a\r\nfact which is of itself not without considerable significance. We have\r\nthe unflinching logic and sound common-sense of Father Bernard Vaughan,\r\nwhose verdict is reiterated by the Rev. James Adderley and the Rev. J.\r\nA. V. Magee; the concise, outspoken, pertinent and telling comments of\r\nGeneral Booth; the vague hopelessly inadequate flotsam of Dr. Percy\r\nDearmer,[92] vapid stuff which makes a theologian writhe; the sweet\r\nsugary sentimentalism of Miss Evelyn Underhill, so anæmic, so obviously\r\npopular, and so ingenuously miscalled mysticism; the dull worthless dross\r\nof Mr. McCabe’s superstitious materialism; the feverish panicky special\r\npleading of the convinced Spiritists. Here, too, we have much that\r\ndirectly bears out our present contention, the medical evidence of such\r\nnames as Sir Bryan Donkin; Dr. W. H. Stoddart, who treats of “The Danger\r\nto Mental Sanity”; with Dr. Bernard Hollander on “The Peril of Spirits”;\r\nand Dr. A. T. Schofield on “The Spiritist Epidemic.” Thus Dr. Stoddart\r\nwrites: “In some cases the spiritualistic hallucinations so dominate\r\nthe whole mental life that the condition amounts to insanity; and I\r\ncan confirm Sir Bryan Donkin’s statement that spiritualistic inquiries\r\ntend to induce insanity.”[93] Dr. Hollander is even more emphatic: “The\r\npractice is a dangerous one. Persons become intoxicated with spirits of\r\nthat nature as others do with spirits of another kind. And similarly, as\r\nnot all persons who take alcohol get drunk, so not all spiritualists show\r\nthe effects of their indulgences.... But that is no proof against the\r\nharmful nature of these practices, and, as a mental specialist, I confess\r\nI have seen victims of both, and that the one addicted to material\r\nspirits is the easier to treat.”[94] Spiritism, Dr. Schofield points\r\nout, “has been known to Christians for 2000 years. Any benefit derived\r\ntherefrom is more than neutralized by the very doubtful surroundings and\r\ncharacter of the supposed revelation (I say ‘supposed’ because it has\r\nbeen known so long). If, however, it must be coupled with the dangers,\r\nhorrors, and frauds that so often in modern Spiritism accompany the\r\nknowledge of the unseen, we are almost as well without it, at any rate\r\nfrom such a source.... There can be no doubt the epidemic will eventually\r\nsubside, but before it does, the vast mischief of a spiritual tidal wave\r\nof very doubtful origin will be most disastrously done, and thousands\r\nof unstable souls will be wrecked in spirit, if not in mind and body\r\nas well.... To class it as a religion is an insult to the faith of\r\nChrist.”[95]\r\n\r\nSir William Barrett utters a word of grave import: “All excitable\r\nand unbalanced minds need to be warned away from a subject that may\r\ncause, and in many cases has caused, serious mental derangement.”[96]\r\n“Spiritualism,” says Father Bernard Vaughan, “only too often means loss\r\nof health, loss of morals and loss of faith. Consult not Sir Oliver Lodge\r\nor Sir Arthur Conan Doyle or Mr. Vale Owen, but your family medical\r\nadviser, and he will tell you to keep away from the séance-room as you\r\nwould from an opium den. In fact, the drug habit is not more fatal\r\nthan the practice of Spiritualism in very many cases. Read the warning\r\nnote sounded by Dr. Charles Mercier, or by Dr. G. H. Robertson or by\r\nColonel R. H. Elliot, and be satisfied that yielding to Spiritualism is\r\nqualifying for an asylum. You may not get there but you deserve to be\r\nan inmate.”[97] The following letter written by Miss Mary G. Cardwell,\r\nM.B., Ch.B., from the Oldham Union Infirmary, speaks for itself: “One\r\nday recently I admitted a woman of thirty-five years to the hospital of\r\nwhich I have the honour to be resident medical officer. She was sent in\r\nas incapable of looking after herself or her family. She told me that she\r\nwas a medium, having been introduced into Spiritualism by a man, also\r\na medium, who said he could thereby help her over some family worries.\r\nAs a direct result of this, she has neglected her children, so that the\r\npublic authorities have removed them from her care, her home is ruined,\r\nand she herself is a mental and moral wreck. She had paid the other\r\nmedium for his services by the sacrifice of her virtue.”[98] And this is\r\nno isolated, no exceptional, instance. I have myself known precisely\r\nsimilar cases.\r\n\r\nOccasionally some particularly shocking incident will find its way into\r\nthe public Press and we have records such as the following, which was\r\nheaded “Family of Eleven Mad. Burning Mania after Séance. Child to be\r\nSacrificed.\r\n\r\n“The story of an entire family of eleven persons, in the village of\r\nKrucktenhofen, Bavaria, going out of their minds after a spiritualistic\r\nséance is sent by the Exchange Paris correspondent, quoting the _Berliner\r\nTageblatt_.\r\n\r\n“Renouncing the goods of this world, the father, mother, three sons, two\r\nelder daughters, and subsequently the remaining four younger members of\r\nthe family, joined in burning their furniture and bedding.\r\n\r\n“Finally, the three-months-old child of one of the daughters was about\r\nto be burnt when neighbours interfered. The whole family is now in an\r\nasylum.” (_Daily Mirror_, 19 May, 1921.)\r\n\r\n“Camouflage it as you will, Spiritualism with its kindred superstitions,\r\nsuch as necromancy and occultism, is a recrudescence of the old, old\r\npractices cultivated in the days of long ago.”[99] In other words this\r\n“New Religion” is but the Old Witchcraft. There is, I venture to assert,\r\nnot a single phenomenon of modern Spiritism which cannot be paralleled in\r\nthe records of the witch trials and examinations; not a single doctrine\r\nwhich was not believed and propagated by the damnable Gnostic heresies of\r\nlong ago.\r\n\r\nSome of the definitions of Spiritism given by spiritists themselves\r\nare sufficiently startling. They frankly tell us that “Spiritualism is\r\nthe science or art of communion with spirits.... It does not follow\r\nthat because a communication comes from ‘the unseen,’ it is therefore\r\nfrom God, as a revelation. It may be from the latest dead lounger, as\r\nan amusement,”[100] or, I would add, from a demon as a snare. There\r\nis something inexpressibly ugly and revolting about this cold-blooded\r\nnecromancy defined in set categorical terms.\r\n\r\nModern Spiritism is usually considered to have had its origin in America.\r\nIn the year 1848 there lived at Hydesville, Wayne, New York State, a\r\nfamily of the Methodist persuasion named Fox; a father, mother, and two\r\ndaughters, Margaretta and Katie, aged fifteen and twelve respectively.\r\nDuring the month of March all the household began to declare that they\r\nwere kept awake at night by the most extraordinary noises, loud knockings\r\non the wall, and footsteps. The children amused themselves by trying\r\nto imitate the noises; they tapped on the wainscot, and to their great\r\nsurprise answering taps came back, so that they found they could get into\r\ncommunication with the unknown agency. They would ask a question and\r\ninvite it to respond with one sharp rap for “no” and three for “yes,” and\r\nthus it continually replied. They further held actual conversations in\r\nthis way by repeating the alphabet and establishing a regular code. Mrs.\r\nFox then began to make inquiries concerning the former occupants of the\r\nhouse, and soon discovered that a pedlar named Charles Rayn was said to\r\nhave been murdered in the very bedroom where her two girls were sleeping,\r\nand that his body had been buried in the cellar. Public curiosity was\r\naroused, and it was now generally believed that it was the spirit of the\r\nunfortunate victim who haunted the farm-house, endeavouring to convey\r\nsome message to those whom he had left. Actually no body was found in\r\nthe cellar, and the alleged murderer whose name was given, appeared\r\nat Hydesville and “threw very hot water on the story.” Later when the\r\nfamily moved to Rochester—it is said they were practically driven out of\r\nHydesville by the Methodist minister there—the rappings followed them,\r\nand the whole town was speedily on the tiptoe of excitement. It was\r\nthen given out that the noises were communications from the spirits of\r\nthose recently dead, and that the Fox girls, who apparently attracted\r\nthem, were gifted with some special faculty which rendered intercourse\r\nof this kind possible. People soon began to flock round them asking\r\ntheir assistance in getting messages from their departed relatives and\r\nfriends; the two girls held regular séances, and netted a fair sum of\r\nmoney. It was not long before other persons discovered that they also\r\npossessed this extraordinary faculty of attracting spirit manifestations,\r\nand of getting into communication with the other world at will. But\r\nthe Fox sisters were first in the field, and to them came a continuous\r\nstream of persons with well-filled pockets from all parts of America.\r\nThere was also opposition, which sometimes took a very violent form.\r\nAs early as November, 1850, an attack was made upon Margaretta Fox,\r\nwho was staying at West Troy in the house of a Mr. Bouton. A rough mob\r\nsurrounded the premises, stones were thrown at the windows, and shots\r\nfired, whilst both men and women uttered threats and imprecations against\r\nthe “unholy witch-woman within.” At one of the séances Dr. Kane, a famous\r\nArctic explorer was present, and he was so fascinated by the beauty of\r\nMargaretta Fox that he never rested until he had taken her away from\r\nher sordid and harmful surroundings, had her educated at Philadelphia,\r\nand finally, much to the annoyance of his relations, who loathed any\r\nconnexion with the Fox family, made her his wife.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane died soon after his marriage, but in the book published by his\r\nwidow there are several references to his abhorrence of Spiritism. “Do\r\navoid spirits,” he urges, “I cannot bear to think of you as engaged in a\r\ncourse of wickedness and deception.” For ten years Mrs. Kane did indeed\r\nabandon it; in fact in August, 1858, she was baptized as a Catholic at\r\nNew York; but then,[101] owing perhaps to the pinch of poverty, she\r\nagain took up work as a medium, and was received back with acclamations\r\nby the whole Spiritistic community. From that moment dates her steady\r\ndeterioration, both physical and moral.\r\n\r\nKate Fox, Mrs. Jencken as she had become, the wife of a London barrister,\r\nwas the mother of a baby whom popular talk credited with mediumistic\r\npowers of the most extraordinary kind. The whole Spiritistic following\r\nprophesied a brilliant future for the poor child, of whom, however, there\r\nis nothing recorded save that he was sadly neglected by his miserable\r\nmother, who died of chronic alcoholism in June, 1892. Mrs. Kane survived\r\nher sister for nine months, a pitiable and hopeless wreck, craving only\r\nfor drink. The last few weeks of her life were spent in a derelict\r\ntenement house. “This wreck of womanhood has been a guest in palaces and\r\ncourts. The powers of mind now imbecile were the wonder and the study\r\nof scientific men in America, Europe, and Australia.... The lips that\r\nutter little else now than profanity, once promulgated the doctrine of a\r\nnew religion.”[102] It would, indeed, be difficult to conceive anything\r\nmore sordid and more miserable than this sad and shocking story of utter\r\ndegradation. The collapse and moral corruption of the first apostles of\r\nmodern Spiritism should surely prove a timely warning and a danger signal\r\nnot to be mistaken.[103]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days of Spiritism the subject was investigated by men\r\nlike Horace Greeley, William Lloyd Garrison, Robert Hare, professor of\r\nchemistry in the University of Pennsylvania, and John Worth Edmonds,\r\na judge of the Supreme Court of New York State. Conspicuous among the\r\nspiritists we find Andrew Jackson Davis, whose work _The Principles of\r\nNature_ (1847), dictated by him in trance, contained theories of the\r\nuniverse closely resembling those of the Swedenborgians. From America the\r\nmovement filtered through to Europe, and when in 1852 two mediums, Mrs.\r\nHaydon and Mrs. Roberts, came to London, not merely popular interest but\r\nthe careful attention of the leading scientists of the day was attracted.\r\nRobert Owen, the Socialist, frankly accepted the Spiritistic explanation\r\nof the various phenomena, while Professor De Morgan, the mathematician,\r\nin his account of a sitting with Mrs. Haydon declared himself convinced\r\nthat “somebody or some spirit was reading his thoughts.” In the spring\r\nof 1855 Daniel Dunglas Home (Hume)—Home was the son of the eleventh\r\nLord Home and a chambermaid at the Queen’s Hotel, Southampton, but was\r\nbrought up in America—who was then a young man of twenty-two, crossed\r\nto England from America. In 1856 Home was received into the Church at\r\nRome by Father John Etheridge, S.J., and he then gave a promise to\r\nrefrain from all exercise of his mediumistic powers, but in less than\r\na year he had broken his pledge and was living as before. This famous\r\nmedium is almost the only one who, as even Podmore admits, was never\r\nclearly convicted of fraud. Sir David Brewster, the scientist, and Dr.\r\nJ. J. Garth Wilkinson, a scholar of unblemished integrity and one of the\r\nleading homœopathic physicians, both avowed that they were incapable of\r\nexplaining the phenomena they had witnessed by any natural means. It was\r\nin 1855 that the first English periodical dealing exclusively with the\r\nsubject, _The Yorkshire Spiritual Telegraph_, was published at Keighley,\r\nin Yorkshire. In 1864 the Davenport brothers visited England, and in 1876\r\nHenry Slade. Amongst English mediums the Rev. William Stainton Moses\r\nbecame prominent in 1872,[104] and about the same year Miss Florence\r\nCook, so well known for the materializations of “Katie King,” which\r\nwere scrupulously investigated by the late Sir William Crookes. In 1873\r\nand in 1874, however, the trickery of two mediums, Mrs. Bassett and Miss\r\nShowers, was definitely exposed.[105] In 1876 and 1877 the sensitive\r\n“Dr.” Monck was at the height of his reputation, and both Dr. Alfred\r\nRussel Wallace, F.R.S., and the late Archdeacon Colley state that in\r\nvarious séances with him they witnessed on several occasions phenomena,\r\nincluding materialization, under rigid test conditions which admitted\r\nof no dispute as to their genuineness. It is true that in 1876 Monck\r\nhad been in trouble and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment under\r\nthe Vagrant Act. About the same time William Eglinton, who figures in\r\nFlorence Marryat’s work _There is No Death_, appeared on the scenes\r\nand for a while loomed largely in the public eye. He became famous for\r\nhis slate-writing performances as well as his materializations. He\r\nwas, however, exposed by Archdeacon Colley, who during the discussion\r\nwhich had centred round a medium named Williams, detected in fraudulent\r\npractices during séances in Holland, wrote to _The Medium and Daybreak_\r\nto say: “It unfortunately fell to me to take muslin and false beard from\r\nEglinton’s portmanteau.... Some few days before this I had on two several\r\noccasions cut pieces from the drapery worn by, and clipped hair from the\r\nbeard of, the other figure representing Abdullah. I have the pieces so\r\ncut off beard and muslin still. But note that when I took these things\r\ninto my possession I and a medical gentleman (25 years a Spiritualist and\r\nwell known to the old members of the Movement) found the pieces of muslin\r\ncut fit exactly into certain corresponding portions of the drapery thus\r\ntaken.”[106]\r\n\r\nThe medium Slade, who was famous for slate-writing, was upon one\r\noccasion suddenly seized as he was about to put the slate under the\r\ntable. His hands were held fast, and when the slate was snatched from\r\nhim it was seen to be already covered with characters. Anna Rothe, who\r\ndied in 1901, a medium well known for her apports of flowers, suffered\r\na term of imprisonment in Germany on a charge of fraud. When Baily, the\r\nAustralian sensitive, visited Italy he refused to sit under the strict\r\nconditions which were arranged in answer to a challenge of his powers.\r\nCharles Eldred of Clowne, an adept at materialization, employed a chair\r\nskilfully made with a double seat, and in this recess were discovered the\r\nwhole paraphernalia he employed in his performances.\r\n\r\nMrs. Williams, an American medium, who for a long while was a centre of\r\nspiritistic attention at Paris, used to materialize a venerable doctor\r\nwith a flowing beard who was sometimes accompanied by a young girl\r\ndressed in white. At one circle Mons. Paul Leymaric gave a prearranged\r\nsignal. He and a friend each laid hold of one of the apparitions; a\r\nthird spectator seized Mrs. Williams’ assistant; and a fourth turned on\r\nthe lights. Mons. Leymaric was seen to be struggling with the medium,\r\nwho had donned a grey wig and a long property beard; the young girl was\r\na mask from which were draped folds of fine white muslin and which she\r\nmanipulated with her left hand. Miller, a Californian medium, was more\r\nthan suspected of producing spirits from gauze and nun’s veiling.[107]\r\nFrom one of the mediums of Mons. de Rochas, Valentine, there emanated\r\nmysterious lights, which moved quickly hither and thither during the\r\nséances. Colonel de Rochas, when this manifestation was once at its\r\nheight, suddenly switched on a powerful electric torch and Valentine was\r\nseen to have slipped off his socks and to be waving in the air his feet,\r\nwhich were covered with some preparation of phosphorus.[108] As early as\r\nJune, 1875, a photographer named Buguet was convicted of selling faked\r\nphotographs of spirits by which he netted a very pretty sum.[109]\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that in Spiritistic séances and circles charlatanry and\r\nswindling of every kind are rife; that again and again mediums have\r\nbeen convicted of fraud; that not infrequently all kinds of properties,\r\nstuffed gloves, gauzes, yards of diaphanous muslin, invisible wires,\r\nhooks, beards, wigs, have been discovered; that the use of luminous\r\npaint is very effective and far from uncommon; that a sliding trap or\r\npanel may on occasion prove of inestimable service; that we must allow\r\nfor self-deception, delusions, suggestion, hypnotism even; but when all\r\nhas been said, when we candidly acknowledge the imposture, the adroit\r\nlegerdemain, the conjurer’s clever tricks, the significant _mise en\r\nscène_, the verbal wit and quibbling, the deliberate and subtle cozenage\r\ncontrived by shrewd minds and the full play of dramatic instinct and\r\nenergy, nevertheless there yet remain numbers of instances when it has\r\nbeen repeatedly proven that acute and trained observers have witnessed\r\nphenomena which could not by any possibility whatsoever have been\r\nfraudulently produced; that clear-headed, cold-hearted, suspicious, hard\r\nmen of science with every sense keenly alert at that very moment have\r\nconversed with, inspected, nay, actually handled, materialized forms and\r\nfigures no personation could have devised and manifested.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings against Monck plainly showed that he had at any rate\r\na firm belief in his own psychic powers, and although Eglinton was\r\ndetected in a trick upon more than one occasion there is irrefutable\r\nevidence to prove that in other instances when he assisted at séances\r\nany normal mode of production of the phenomena seen there was quite\r\nimpossible. A large number of Miller’s manifestations also were\r\ngenuine.[110] The same may be said of very many mediums. This means,\r\nin fine, that although the manifestations of almost any medium may in\r\nsome cases have been artificially contrived, such phenomena are not on\r\nany account to be adjudged _always_ fraudulent, and even if the charge\r\nof imposture could be brought home far more conclusively than has so\r\nfar been possible as regards the majority of sensitives, yet it were\r\na false inference indeed to deduce therefrom that all phenomena are\r\nequally fraudulent and devised. It is only the recklessly illogical mind\r\nand the loose thinker who will in the face of absolutely conclusive\r\nproof of genuine manifestations continue to maintain that a certain\r\nquota of quackery can invalidate the whole. Writers of the temper of\r\nMessrs. Edward Clodd, Joseph McCabe, J. M. Robertson must, of course, be\r\nexpected to condemn Spiritism without knowing the facts or weighing the\r\nevidence as an obvious absurdity which calls for no serious refutation.\r\nBut this, I think, matters little. The superstitious dogmatism of the\r\nmaterialist is gravely discredited nowadays. True, the sort of book\r\nhe produces is widely circulated and very successful within certain\r\nlimits. We should expect tenth-rate ideas which could only emanate from\r\na lack of understanding, a total want of imagination, and no training\r\nin metaphysics or philosophy, to have a direct appeal to the immature\r\nintelligences, the uneducated vulgar and the blatant yet presumptuous\r\nignorance, which alone are eager for this kind of outmoded fare.\r\n\r\nIn France Spiritism was first proclaimed by a pamphlet of Guillard\r\n_Table qui danse et Table qui répond_. The way had been long paved owing\r\nto the interest which was generally taken in the doctrines of Emanuel\r\nSwedenborg. Balzac had published in 1835 his esoteric hybrid _Séraphita_\r\n(_Séraphitus_), a fanciful yet interesting work, in which there are many\r\npages of theosophic philosophy. Perhaps he meant these seriously, but\r\nit is impossible to take them as other than flights of romance. In 1848\r\nCohognet more immediately heralded Guillard by publishing at Paris the\r\nfirst volume of his _Arcanes de la vie future devoilées_, which actually\r\ncontains what purport to be communications from the dead. In 1853\r\nséances were being held at Bourges, Strasburg, and Paris, and a regular\r\nfurore ensued. Nothing was talked of but the wonders of Spiritism,\r\nwhich, however, soon met an opponent, Count Agénor de Gasparin, a Swiss\r\nProtestant, who carefully investigated table-turning with a circle of\r\nhis friends and came to the conclusion that the phenomena originated\r\nin some physical force of the human body. It must be admitted that his\r\n_Des Tables Tournantes_ (Paris, 1854) is unconvincing and to some extent\r\nsuperficial, but more perhaps could hardly be expected from a pioneer in\r\nso tortuous an investigation. The Baron de Guldenstubbe, on the contrary,\r\ndeclared his firm belief in the reality of these phenomena and spirit\r\nintervention in general. His work _La Réalité des Esprits_ (Paris, 1857)\r\neloquently argued for his convictions, whilst _Le Livre des Esprits_\r\n(Paris, 1853) by M. Rivail or Rival, better known under his pseudonym\r\nAllan Kardec, became a world-wide textbook to the whole subject. In these\r\nearly days the most distinguished men were wont to meet in the rue des\r\nMartyrs at Paris for séances. Tiedmen Marthèse, governor of Java; the\r\nacademician Saint-René-Taillandier; Sardou, with his son; Flammarion; all\r\nwere constant visitors. The notorious Home was, it is said, expelled from\r\nFrance after a séance at the Tuileries, during which he had touched the\r\narm of the Empress with his naked foot, pretending that it was a caress\r\nfrom the tiny hands of a little child who was about fully to materialize.\r\nNo one, I think, could be surprised to know that the famous Joris Karl\r\nHuysmans, an epicure in the byways of the occult, made many experiments\r\nin Spiritism, and séances were frequently held at No. 11 rue de Sèvres\r\nwhere he lived. Extraordinary manifestations took place, and upon one\r\noccasion at least the circle effected a materialization of General\r\nBoulanger, or an apparition of the General appeared to them.\r\n\r\nAt the present time Spiritism is as widely spread in France as in\r\nEngland, if indeed not far more widely. Thus _La Science de l’Ame_ is a\r\nnew bi-monthly journal issued under the auspices of _La Revue Spirite_.\r\nIt has articles on Magnetism and Radio-activity, the analysis of the\r\nsoul, and vital radiations. In the number of _La Revue Spirite_, which\r\ncommences the year 1925, Mons. Camille Flammarion prints a signed letter\r\nfrom Heliopolis, which describes a first experience of a séance, where\r\nthe death of the writer’s father was predicted in six months and took\r\nplace ten days after the allotted time. Elsewhere in the issue are\r\nparticulars of the International Congress of Spiritism which was to be\r\nheld at Paris in September, 1925, and would be open to all Federations,\r\nSocieties, and Groups everywhere. An immense concourse was expected.\r\nThe President is Mr. George F. Berry, a well-known name in English\r\nSpiritistic circles, and the compliment of honorary membership is paid to\r\nLéon Denis,[111] Gabriel Delanne, Sir William Barrett, and Ernest Bozzano.\r\n\r\nA glance at the pages of any Spiritistic journal in England will show\r\nalmost endless activities in every direction. In one issue of the\r\nweekly _Light_ (Saturday, 21 February, 1925) we have amongst other\r\nannouncements nine “Sunday’s Society Meetings” in various districts of\r\nLondon, with addresses on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The following seems\r\nsufficiently startling and a close enough imitation: “_St. Luke’s Church\r\nof the Spiritual Evangel of Jesus the Christ, Queen’s-road, Forest\r\nHill, S.E._—Minister: Rev. J. W. Potter. February 22nd, 6.30, Service,\r\nHoly Communion and Address. Healing Service, Wed., Feb. 25th, 7 p.m.”\r\nIn the next column are details of “Rev. G. Vale Owen’s Lecture Tour.”\r\nThe “London Spiritualist Alliance, Ltd.” has a list of meetings. There\r\nare discussion classes and demonstrations of clairvoyance, psychometry,\r\nand Mystic Pictures. Among “Books that will Help you” we find _Talks\r\nwith the Dead_, _Report on Spiritualism_, _The Aquarian Gospel of\r\nJesus the Christ_—(is this used at St. Luke’s Church of the Spiritual\r\nEvangel?)—_Spirit Identity, Spiritualism_, and many more of similar\r\nimport. There is a “British College of Psychic Science” where Mr. Horace\r\nLeaf, a medium of some repute, lectures on “The Psychology and Practice\r\nof Mediumship,” Mrs. Barker demonstrates Trance Mediumship, and Mrs.\r\nTravers Smith the Ouija-Board and Automatic Writing. There is a “London\r\nSpiritual Mission” and a “Wimbledon Spiritualist Mission.” At Brighton\r\n“St. John’s Brotherhood Church” provides “The Spiritual Evangel of Jesus\r\nthe Christ,” “Minister, Brother John.” And all this is scarcely a tithe\r\nof the various announcements and advertisements.\r\n\r\nHowever grotesque, and indeed often puerile in its bombast and\r\ngrandiloquence, such a mass of heterogeneous notices may seem we must\r\nremember that these people are in deadly earnest, and I doubt not but\r\ntheir meetings and assemblies are well attended by enthusiastic devotees.\r\nIn a report of an address by the Rev. G. Vale Owen at the “Spiritualist\r\nCommunity Services in the County Hall” on Sunday evening, 15 February,\r\n1925, I read “all seats were filled long before the advertised hour\r\nfor starting. The doors were closed and many for a time were denied\r\nadmission. A little later they were allowed to enter and take up\r\npositions along the edges of the dais and other odd places about the\r\nhall.”[112] This, of course, was possibly some exceptional occasion, but\r\nthere is no indication that such was the case. Mr. Vale Owen may be a\r\nvery eloquent speaker and able to hold his audience spell-bound with the\r\nmagic of his words. It must assuredly be his manner and not his matter,\r\nfor his so-called revelations of the life beyond the grave, written under\r\ncontrol and presumed to be directly derived from spirit agency, which\r\nappeared in _The Weekly Dispatch_ are vapid, inept, idle, and insipid to\r\nthe last degree. Such banal ramblings would provoke a smile, were it not\r\nfor the pity that any person can be so self-deluded, and can apparently\r\ninduce others to give credit to his silliness.\r\n\r\nThere have been large numbers of mediums in recent years who owing to\r\none cause or another attracted considerable attention from time to\r\ntime, and there are many well-known contemporary sensitives widely\r\npractising to-day. Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland, who were believed to\r\nhave obtained spirit messages from the late F. W. H. Myers, occupied\r\nthe serious attention of the Society of Psychical Research[113] for a\r\nconsiderable period; Mrs. Piper is an automatic writer of no little\r\nrepute; Mr. Vout Peters specializes in psychometry and clairvoyance;\r\nMr. Vearncombe and Mrs. Deane have recently enjoyed their full share\r\nof notoriety;[114] the Rev. Josie K. Stewart (Mrs. Y.), a lady hailing\r\nfrom the United States, has a gift for the production of “writing and\r\ndrawings on cards held in her hand”; Mrs. Elizabeth A. Tomson, in spite\r\nof being detected of fraud at a Spiritistic “Church” in Brooklyn, still\r\nhas devoted followers; Franek Kluski, Stella C., and Ada Besinnet, are\r\nin the forefront of American mediums; whilst the famous Goligher circle\r\nat Belfast was carefully and patiently investigated for no less than\r\nthree months by Dr. Fournier d’Albe, who has published the result of\r\nhis experiences.[115] The very cream of these occult manifestations\r\nis materialization, the most complex problem of all, which has been\r\ndescribed as “the exercise of the power of using of the matter of the\r\nmedium’s and the sitters’ bodies in the formation of physical structures\r\non a principle totally unknown to ordinary life, although probably\r\npresent there.”[116] Recently (1922) Erto, the Italian medium, appears to\r\nhave been the subject of careful experiments at the French Metaphysical\r\nInstitute during a period of several months, those who assisted being\r\npledged to silence until a decision had been reached. The particular\r\nphenomena produced by or in his presence were chiefly characterized by\r\nthe radiation of an extraordinary light about his person. At the end\r\nof 1922 two papers appeared in _La Revue Métapsychique_ on the part of\r\nDr. Sanguinetti and Dr. William Mackenzie of Genoa indicating their\r\nassurance (1) that every scientific precaution had been taken, and\r\n(2) that the phenomena were genuine. However, the experiments seem to\r\nhave continued and later there appeared in _Le Matin_ an enthusiastic\r\ncontribution by Dr. Stephen Chauvet, which caused Dr. Gustave Geley,\r\nDirector of the Metaphysical Institute, to come forward in confirmation\r\nof the testimony. It is only fair to add that immediately afterwards\r\nDr. Geley to a certain extent retracted his statement, as he suggested\r\nthat the psychic lights could be produced with _ferro-cerium_, and\r\nit was thought that traces of this substance could be found on Erto’s\r\nclothes. The medium protested his innocence of any deception, and offers\r\nhimself for further experiments. A writer in _Psychica_ is inclined to\r\nbelieve that the phenomena were genuine, but that later some fraud may\r\nhave been practised owing to waning power. This is possibly the case,\r\nfor that the radiations were at first supernormal cannot, I think, be\r\ngainsaid in view of the high testimony adduced. For this phenomenon Mr.\r\nCecil Hush and Mr. Craddock have sat repeatedly; of the extraordinary\r\nmanifestations of the late Eusapia Palladino there can be no reasonable\r\ndoubt at all; the materializations of Mlle “Eva Carrère,”[117] although\r\non several occasions not altogether successful, are at other times\r\nsupported by the strongest evidence; Nino Pecoraro, who is described as\r\n“a remarkably muscular young Neapolitan,” is famous for “ectoplasmic\r\neffects”; and Stanislava P., Willy S., the Countess Castelvicz, and\r\nvery many more psychics possess these supernormal powers, although, as\r\nwe might expect, they have to be used with the utmost caution and often\r\nprove very exhausting to the subject. After all, it must be remembered\r\nthat probably under certain conditions materialization cannot take place,\r\nwhilst under favourable conditions it can be completely effected. For an\r\nexhaustive and authoritative discussion of the whole matter the Baron Von\r\nSchrenck-Notzing’s _Phenomena of Materialization_ (Kegan Paul, 1923),\r\nshould be consulted. The 225 photographic reproductions are of the utmost\r\nimportance, whilst the investigations were carried on under conditions\r\nof such pitiless severity to eliminate any hypothesis of fraud that the\r\nmediums cannot but have been subjected to the intensest physical and\r\nmoral strain.\r\n\r\nAmong recent psychic phenomena very general attention has been attracted\r\nby what is known as “The Oscar Wilde Script,” which was widely discussed\r\nin 1923-24. Briefly, this purports to be a number of communications which\r\nwere delivered by the spirit of the late Oscar Wilde at the rate of 1020\r\nwords in an hour by means of automatic writing through the mediumship\r\nof Mrs. Travers Smith (Mrs. Hester M. Dowden)[118] and a certain Mr. V.\r\nTrue, there were published in _The Sunday Express_ pages which had a\r\nsuperficial resemblance to the more flashy characteristics of Wilde’s\r\nflamboyant style, but it seemed as if the wit and point had vanished,\r\nleaving only a somewhat heavy and imitative prose; one had a sense of\r\ndamp fireworks, and personally I do not for a moment accept this script\r\nas being inspired or dictated by Wilde. I hasten to add that I do not\r\nsuggest there was any conscious fraud or trickery on the part of those\r\nconcerned; it is quite probable that these psychic messages were conveyed\r\nby some intelligence of no very high standing, and the result in fine is\r\nnot of any value. It is said that a three act play is being or has been\r\ncommunicated through the ouija-board from what purports to be Wilde. This\r\nI have not read, and therefore I am not in a position to pronounce upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSpiritism is upheld by many distinguished names. Sir Oliver Lodge,\r\nF.R.S., has battled on its behalf, as also have Sir William Barrett,\r\nF.R.S., and Sir William Crookes, F.R.S., Professors Charles Richet,\r\nJanet, Bernheim, Lombroso, and Flammarion lend it the weight of their\r\nauthority, whilst Sir Conan Doyle has poured forth his benedictions upon\r\noccultism of every kind.[119] He has even presided over the opening\r\nof a most attractive bookshop in Victoria Street, Westminster, where\r\nSpiritistic publications are sold.\r\n\r\nHow then are we to regard this mighty movement at which it were folly\r\nto sneer, which it is impossible to ignore? The Catholic Church does\r\nneither. But none the less she condemns it utterly and entirely. Not\r\nbecause she disbelieves in it, but because she believes in it so\r\nthoroughly, because she knows what is the real nature of the moving\r\nforces, however skilfully they may disguise themselves, however quick\r\nand subtle their shifts and turns, the intelligences which inform and\r\ndirect the whole. It is a painful subject since (I reiterate) many\r\ngood people, no doubt many thoughtful seekers after truth, have been\r\nfascinated and swept along by Spiritism. They are as yet conscious of\r\nneither physical nor moral harm, and, it may be, they have been playing\r\nwith the fire for years. Nay more, Spiritism has been a sweet solace\r\nto many in most poignant hours of bitter sorrow and loss; wherefore\r\nit is hallowed in their eyes by tenderest memories. They are woefully\r\ndeceived. Hard as it may seem, we must get down to the bed-rock of\r\nfact. Spiritism has been specifically condemned on no less than four\r\noccasions by the Holy Office,[120] whose decree, 30 March, 1898, utterly\r\nforbids all Spiritistic practices although intercourse with demons be\r\nstrictly excluded, and communication sought with good spirits only.\r\nModern Spiritism is merely Witchcraft revived. The Second Plenary Council\r\nof Baltimore (1866), whilst making ample allowance for prestidigitation\r\nand trickery of every kind, warns the faithful against lending any\r\nsupport whatsoever to Spiritism and forbids them to attend séances even\r\nout of idle curiosity, for some, at least, of the manifestations must\r\nnecessarily be ascribed to Satanic intervention since in no other manner\r\ncan they be understood or explained.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n[1] E. de Rougé, _Étude sur une stèle Égyptienne_, Paris, 1858: E.

Martin of Tours was\r\nwont to cast out demons by prayer alone without the imposition of hands\r\nor the use of the formulæ recommended to the clergy. Similar instances\r\noccur in the lives of the Saints.\r\n\r\n[40] Translated from the _Rituale Romanum_. There are several forms\r\nextant, some authorized, but more, perhaps, unauthorized. There is\r\nan authorized form in the Greek _Euchologion_. It commences with the\r\nTrisagion, and Psalms, _Domine exaudi_ (cxlii.), _Dominus regit me_\r\n(xxii.), _Dominus illuminatio mea_ (xxvi.), _Esurgat Deus_ (lxvii.),\r\n_Miserere_ (lvi.), _Domine ne in furore_ (vi.), _Domine exaudi orationem_\r\n(ci.). Then follows the Consolatory Canon, with a long Hymn addressed to\r\nOur Lord, Our Lady, and All Saints. Next the priest anoints the patient,\r\nsaying a prayer over him, and so the office closes.\r\n\r\n[41] It is also given in the _Horæ Diurnæ O.P._, Rome, 1903, where an\r\nindulgence of 300 days is attached, plenary once a month.\r\n\r\n[42] Ab insidiis diaboli, libera nos Domine; Ut Ecclesiam tuam secura\r\ntibi facias libertate seruire, te rogamus, audi nos; Ut inimicos sanctæ\r\nEcclesiæ humiliare digneris, te rogamus, audi nos. _Et aspergatur locus\r\naqua benedicta._\r\n\r\n[43] Holy water, the commonest of the sacramentals, is a mixture of\r\nexorcised salt and exorcised water.\r\n\r\n[44] Of Eastern origin. It should be remembered that the Baptism of\r\nChrist in Jordan is commemorated on the Epiphany. In the present Breviary\r\noffice in Nocturn I the first response for the day, the Octave, and\r\nthe Sunday within the Octave deal with the Baptism, as does the second\r\nresponse. The antiphon to the Benedictus and the Magnificat antiphon at\r\nSecond Vespers also make mention of the same mystery. In Rome the Latin\r\nrite of the Blessing of the Waters is pontificated by a Cardinal at\r\nS. Andrea della Valle on 5 January, about 3.30 p.m., at the church of\r\nthe Stimmate of S.

Atanasio,\r\nbeginning about 3.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n[45] See Wilson, _Western Africa_; and the article “Possession\r\ndiabolique” by Waffelaert in the _Dictionnaire apologétique de la foi\r\ncatholique_, Paris, 1889.

Maurus, who was with S. Benedict,\r\nbeheld an apparition, and S. Benedict once enabled a monk to see a\r\nsimilar vision.\r\n\r\n[53] One of Sodoma’s exquisite frescoes at Monte Oliveto (Siena) depicts\r\nan exorcism by S.

Amen.\r\n\r\n[55] All English Benedictine priests hold the special faculty to use\r\nthis (bestowed 23 February, 1915), and it has also been granted to many\r\nothers, religious and seculars.\r\n\r\n[56] Omnis virtus aduersarii, omnis exercitus diaboli, et omnis incursus,\r\nomnis phantasma Satanæ, eradicate et effugare ab his numismatibus....\r\n\r\n[57] Domine Iesu Christe ... per hanc tuam sanctissimam passionem\r\nhumiliter exoro; ut omnes diabolicas insidias et fraudes expellas ab eo,\r\nqui nomen sanctum tuum, his litteris ac characteribus a te designatis,\r\ndeuote inuocauerit, et eum ad salutis portum perducere digneris.

London, 1907), indecorously attacks this\r\nand treats S. Maurus with scant respect. A worthy defence was made by\r\nAdlhoch, _Stud. u. Mittheil._, 1903, 3; 1906, 185.

Some think the booke\r\nto be the Bishop’s owne doing: and many thinke it to be the joynt work of\r\nthem both.”\r\n\r\n[66] On 10 November, 1629, he was sworn of the Privy Council.\r\n\r\n[67] Whence Shakespeare derived the names of various evil spirits whom\r\nEdgar mentions in _King Lear_.\r\n\r\n[68] I do not conceive that at the present time many, if any, Bishops\r\nof the Church of England would license exorcism. Certainly the more\r\nscientifically minded and modernistic Lords Spiritual of the Anglican\r\nbench have rid themselves of such an idle superstition. How they would\r\nexplain Our Blessed Lord’s words and actions I do not pretend to know,\r\nbut I suppose that according to their wider knowledge Christ—_sit uenia\r\nuerbis_—was mistaken in this as in other particulars.\r\n\r\n[69] _Colloquia Mensalia_, passim.\r\n\r\n[70] It is difficult to see how the teachings of such a Protestant leader\r\nas Gaspar von Schwenckfeld (1489-90—1561) are anything save tantamount to\r\nmere personal morality and a vague individual pietism.

Toutefois les vexations diaboliques cessèrent vers\r\nla fin de 1897. Ces vexations durèrent donc près de quarante-sept années,\r\ndont six de possession.\r\n\r\n[85] Du 25 mars, 1850, au courant de mars, 1868, Hélène _fut seulement\r\nobsédée. Cette obsession dura donc 18 années_. Au bout de ce temps et\r\npendant 13 _mois_ elle fut _obsédée et possédée tout ensemble_.\r\n\r\nDe I’obsession et de la possession elle fut complètement délivrée par les\r\nexorcismes officiels, à Orléans, le 19 avril, 1869.\r\n\r\nSuivirent quatre mois de tranquillité, jusqu’au recommencement volontaire\r\net généreux de ses peines.\r\n\r\nA la fin d’août, 1869, elle accepta de la main de Notre Seigneur les\r\ntourments d’une nouvelle obsession et possession afin d’obtenir la\r\nconversion du célèbre général Ducrot. La conversion obtenue, elle fut\r\ndélivrée à Lourdes le 3 septembre, 1875, par les prières des 15,000\r\npèlerins qui s’y trouvaient réunis. _Obsession et possession renouvelées_\r\navaient duré cinq ans.\r\n\r\nPlus jamais, pendant les quarante ans qu’elle avait encore à vivre, elle\r\nne fut possédée; mais elle continua à être obsédée tantôt plus, tantôt\r\nmoins. Les souffrances de toutes sortes, qu’elle endura alors, eurent\r\npour but d’obtenir le salut et le triomphe du clergé.\r\n\r\nQuant aux raisons et au but des premières persécutions diaboliques\r\nqu’elle subit pendant dix-neuf ans et dont elle fut délivrée par\r\nles exorcismes officiels, ils sont restés inconnus. _Une Possédée\r\nContemporaine_ (1834-1914), pp. 171-2.\r\n\r\n[86] A fragment of the soutane of this most holy Pontiff was taken to\r\nHélène and during one of her fits placed upon her forehead. At the\r\ncontact she cried out: “Le Pape est un saint, oui un grand saint.” (The\r\nPope is a Saint, truly a great Saint!)\r\n\r\n[87] Pour y être admis, il faut apporter une ou plusiers hosties\r\nconsacrées, les remettre au démon qui, sous forme corporelle ou visible,\r\npréside l’assemblée.

It is said that the knockings at the house of Parsons, Cock\r\nLane, West Smithfield, in 1760, were proved to be fraud, but I do not\r\nknow that the case has ever been candidly studied.\r\n\r\n[101] She took part in a séance on 25 October, 1860, but this seems to\r\nhave been exceptional.\r\n\r\n[102] _Washington Daily Star_, 7 March, 1893, quoted in _The Medium and\r\nthe Daybreak_, 7 April, 1893.\r\n\r\n[103] In the “educational” primers prepared by certain spiritists for use\r\nby children the story of the Fox Sisters is told in glowing colours to a\r\npoint, but the history of their downfall is suppressed.\r\n\r\n[104] He died at Bedford, 5 September, 1892.

For it is\r\nalmost impossible to declaim without appropriate action. From the very\r\nheart of the liturgy itself arose the Mystery Play.\r\n\r\nThe method of performing these early English guild plays has been\r\nfrequently and exactly described, and I would only draw attention to one\r\nfeature of the movable scaffold which passed from station to station,\r\nthat is the dark cavern at the side of the last of the three sedes,\r\nHell-mouth. No pains were spared to make this as horrible and realistic\r\nas might be. Demons with hideous heads issued from it, whilst ever and\r\nanon lurid flames burst forth and dismal cries were heard. Thus the\r\nDigby S. Mary Magdalen play has the stage-direction: “a stage, and Helle\r\nondyrneth that stage.” At Coventry the Cappers had a “hell-mouth” for\r\nthe Harrowing of Hell, and the Weavers another for Doomsday. This was\r\nprovided with fire, a windlass, and a barrel for the earthquake. In\r\nthe stage-directions to Jordan’s Cornish Creation of the World Lucifer\r\ndescends to hell “apareled fowle wᵗʰ fyre about hem” and the place is\r\nfilled with “every degre of devylls of lether and spirytis on cordis.”\r\nAmong the “establies” required for the Rouen play of 1474 was “Enfer fait\r\nen maniere d’une grande gueulle se cloant et ouvrant quant besoing en\r\nest.” The last stage-direction of the _Sponsus_, a liturgical play from\r\nLimoges,—assigned by M. M. W. Cloetta and G. Paris to the earlier half of\r\nthe twelfth century—which deals with the Wise and Foolish Virgins runs as\r\nfollows: “_Modo accipiant eas [fatuas uirgines] dæmones et præcipitentur\r\nin infernum_.”\r\n\r\nThe Devil himself is one of the most prominent characters in the Mystery,\r\nthe villain of the piece. So the York cycle commences with _The Creation\r\nand the Fall of Lucifer_. Whilst the Angels are singing “Holy, Holy,\r\nHoly” before the throne of God, Satan appears exulting in his pride to\r\nbe cast down speedily into hell whence he howls his complaint beginning\r\n“Owte, owte! harrowe!” There is a curious incident in the episode of the\r\nDream of Pilate’s wife. Whilst she sleeps Satan whispers in her ear the\r\nvision which moves her to try to stay the condemnation of Jesus whereby\r\nmankind is to be redeemed. The last play of the York cycle is the _Day of\r\nJudgement_.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the Towneley cycle opens with _The Creation_, and\r\npresently we have the stage-direction _hic deus recedit à suo solio &\r\nlucifer sedebit in eodem solio_. The scene soon shifts to hell when we\r\nhear the demons reproaching Lucifer for his pride. After the creation of\r\nAdam and Eve follows Lucifer’s lament. In the long episode of _Doomsday_\r\na number of demons appear and are kept inordinately busy.\r\n\r\nThe Devil was represented as black, with goat’s horns, ass’s ears, cloven\r\nhoofs, and an immense phallus. He is, in fact, the Satyr of the old\r\nDionysiac processions, a nature-spirit, the essence of joyous freedom\r\nand unrestrained delight, shameless if you will, for the old Greek\r\nknew not shame. He is the figure who danced light-heartedly across the\r\nAristophanaic stage, stark nude in broad midday,[1] animally physical,\r\nexuberant, ecstatic, crying aloud the primitive refrain, Φαλῆς, ἑταῖρε\r\nΒακχίου, ξύγκωμε, νυκτεροπλάνητε, μοιχε, παιδεραστά, (Phales, boon mate\r\nof Bacchus, joyous comrade in the dance, wanton wanderer o’ nights,\r\nfornicating Phales), in a word he was Paganism incarnate, and Paganism\r\nwas the Christian’s deadliest foe; so they took him, the Bacchic\r\nreveller, they smutted him from horn to hoof, and he remained the\r\nChristian’s deadliest foe, the Devil.[2]\r\n\r\nIt was long before the phallic demon was banished the stage, for strange\r\nas it may seem, positive evidence exists that he was known there as late\r\nas Shakespeare’s day. In 1620 was published in London by Edward Wright\r\n_A Courtly Masque: The Deuice called, The World tost at Tennis_. “As it\r\nhath beene diuers times Presented to the Contentment of many Noble and\r\nWorthy Spectators: By the Prince his Seruants.” It was “Inuented and set\r\ndowne by Tho: Middleton, Gent, and William Rowley, Gent.” The title-page\r\npresents a rough engraving of the various characters in this masque,\r\ndoubtless from a sketch made at the actual performance. Outside the main\r\ngroup stands a hideous black figure “The Diuele,” who made his appearance\r\ntowards the end to take part in the last dance, furnished with horns,\r\nhoofs, talons, tail, and a monstrous phallus. It may be remarked that\r\nthese horns are prominent on the goat-like head (a clear satyr) of the\r\nDevil in _Doctor Faustus_ as depicted on the title-page of the Marlovian\r\nquarto. A phallus, to which reference is made in the text, was also worn\r\nby the character dressed up as the monkey (_Bavian_) in the May-dance\r\nscene in Shakespeare & Fletcher’s _The Two Noble Kinsman_, Act III, 5,\r\n1613. It is worth remembering that troops of phallic demons formed a\r\nstanding characteristic of the old German carnival comedy. Moreover,\r\nseveral of the grotesque types of the Commedia dell’ arte in the second\r\ndecade of the seventeenth century were traditionally equipped in like\r\nmanner.[3] That the Devil was so represented in the English theatre\r\nis important. It gives us the popular idea of the Prince of Evil, and\r\nincidentally throws a side-light upon much of the grotesque and obscene\r\nevidence in the contemporary witch-trials.\r\n\r\nIn Skelton’s lost _Nigramansir_ one of the stage directions is stated to\r\nhave been “Enter Balsebub with a beard,” no doubt the black vizard with\r\nan immense goatish beard familiar to the old religious drama. Presumably\r\nthe chief use of the Necromancer, who gives his name to this play, was\r\nindeed but to speak the Prologue which summons the Devil who buffets and\r\nkicks him for his pains. However, we only know the play from Warton,\r\nwho describes it as having been shown him by William Collins, the poet,\r\nat Chichester, about 1759. He says: “It is the Nigramansir, a morall\r\n_Enterlude_ and a pithie, written by Maister Skelton laureate, and plaid\r\nbefore the King and other estatys at Woodstoke on Palme Sunday. It was\r\nprinted by Wynkyn de Worde in a thin quarto, in the year 1504. It must\r\nhave been presented before Henry VII, at the royal manor or palace at\r\nWoodstock in Oxfordshire, now destroyed. The characters are a Necromancer\r\nor conjurer, the devil, a notary public, Simony, and Philargyria or\r\nAvarice. It is partly a satire on some abuses in the Church.... The\r\nstory, or plot, is the trial of Simony and Avarice.” Beyond what Warton\r\ntells us nothing further is known of the play. Ritson, _Bibliographia\r\nPoetica_, 106, declared: “it is utterly incredible that the _Nigramansir_\r\n... ever existed.” It has been shown, too, that Warton as a literary\r\nhistorian is not infrequently suspect, and E. G. Duff, _Hand Lists of\r\nEnglish Printers_, can trace no extant copy of this “morall _Enterlude_.”\r\n\r\nIn the English moralities the Devil plays an important part, and, as\r\nin their French originals or analogues, he is consistently hampering\r\nand opposing the moral purpose or lesson which the action of these\r\ncompositions is designed to enforce. In the later English plays also\r\nwhich evolved with added regularity from these interludes the Devil is\r\nalways a popular character. He is generally attended by the Vice, who\r\nalthough in some sort a serving-man or jester in the fiend’s employ,\r\ndevotes his time to twitting, teazing, tormenting, and thwarting his\r\nmaster for the edification, not unmixed with fun, of the audience. In\r\n_The Castell of Perseverance_ Lucifer appears shouting in good old\r\nfashion “Out herowe I rore,” just as he was wont to announce himself in\r\nthe Mysteries, and he is wearing his “devil’s array” over the habit of a\r\n“prowde galaunt.” Wever’s _Lusty Juventus_ has unmistakable traces of the\r\nslime of the evil days of Edward VI, in whose reign it was written, and\r\nwhen the Devil calls Hipocrisy to his aid we are prepared for a flood of\r\nempty but bitter abuse which embodies the sour Puritan hatred against the\r\nCatholic Church, and towards the end, under the misnomer God’s Merciful\r\nPromises, we are not surprised to meet a tiresome old gentleman who\r\ncantingly expounds the doctrine of Justification by Faith.\r\n\r\nIn the interlude to which Collier has assigned the name _Mankind_\r\nMischief summons to her aid the fiend Titivillus, who had appeared in\r\nthe _Judicium_ of the Towneley Mysteries. Once the Devil’s registrar and\r\ntollsman, he is best known as “Master Lollard.” According to a silly old\r\nsuperstition Titivillus was an imp whose business it was to pick up the\r\nwords any priest might drop and omit whilst saying Mass.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass to the beginnings of the regular drama we find an extremely\r\ninteresting play that introduces, if not magic, at least fortune-telling,\r\nJohn Lyly’s “Pleasant Conceited Comedie” _Mother Bombie_, acted by the\r\nchildren of Paul’s and first printed in 1594. Although the plot is of\r\nthe utmost complexity and artificiality it does not seem to be derived,\r\nas are most of Lyly’s stories, from any classical or pseudo-classical\r\nsource, whilst the cunning old woman of Rochester, who supplies the\r\ntitle, has in fact little to say or do, except that her intervention\r\nhelps to bring about the unravelling of a perfect maze and criss-cross of\r\nincidents. When Selena addresses the beldame with “They say, you are a\r\nwitch,” Mother Bombie quickly retorts “They lie, I am a cunning woman,” a\r\npassage not without significance.\r\n\r\nUpon a very different level from Lyly’s play stands Marlowe’s magnificent\r\ndrama _The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus_. The legend of a man who\r\nsells his soul to the Devil for infinite knowledge and absolute power\r\nseems to have crystallized about the sixth century, when the story of\r\n_Theophilus_ was supposed to have been related in Greek by his pupil\r\nEutychianus. Of course, every warlock had bartered his soul to Satan, and\r\nthroughout the whole of the Middle Ages judicial records, the courts of\r\nthe Inquisition, to say nothing of popular knowledge, could have told of\r\na thousand such. But this particular legend seems to have captured the\r\nimagination of both Western and Eastern Christendom; it is met with in\r\na variety of forms; it was introduced into the collections of Jacopo à\r\nVoragine; it found its way into the minstrel repertory through Rutebeuf,\r\na French _trouvère_ of the thirteenth century; it reappeared in early\r\nEnglish narrative and in Low-German drama. Icelandic variants of the\r\nstory have been traced. It was made the subject of a poem by William\r\nForrest, priest and poet, in 1572; and it also formed the material for\r\ntwo seventeenth-century Jesuit “comedies.”\r\n\r\nThat the original Faust was a real personage,[4] a wandering conjurer and\r\nmedical quack, who was well known in the south-west of the German Empire,\r\nas well as in Thuringia, Saxony, and the adjoining countries somewhere\r\nbetween the years 1510-1540, does not now admit of any serious doubt.\r\nPhilip Begardi, a physician of Worms, author of an _Index Sanitatis_\r\n(1539), mentions this charlatan, many of whose dupes he personally knew.\r\nHe says that Faust was at one time frequently seen, although of later\r\nyears nothing had been heard of him. It has indeed been suggested the\r\nwhole legend originated in the strange history of Pope S. Clement I and\r\nhis father Faustus, or Faustinianus, as related in the _Recognitions_,\r\nwhich were immensely popular throughout the Middle Ages. But Melanchthon\r\nknew a Johannes Faustus born at Knütlingen, in Wurtemberg, not far from\r\nhis own home, who studied magic at Cracow, and afterwards “roamed about\r\nand talked of secret things.” There was a doctor Faustus in the early\r\npart of the sixteenth century, a friend of Paracelsus and Cornelius\r\nAgrippa, a scholar who won an infamous reputation for the practice of\r\nnecromancy. In 1513 Conrad Mutt, the Humanist, came across a vagabond\r\nmagician at Erfurt named Georgius Faustus Hermitheus of Heidelberg.\r\nTrithemius in 1506, met a Faustus junior whose boast it was that if\r\nall the works of Plato and Aristotle were burned he could restore them\r\nfrom memory. It seems probable that it was to the Dr. Faustus, the\r\ncompanion of Paracelsus and Cornelius[5] Agrippa, that the legend became\r\nfinally and definitely attached. The first literary version of the story\r\nwas the _Volksbuch_, which was published by Johann Spies in 1587, at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main, who tells us that he obtained the manuscript “from\r\na good friend at Spier,” and it soon afterwards appeared in England\r\nas _The History of the Damnable Life and Deserved Death of Dr. John\r\nFaustus_, a chap-book to which Marlowe mainly adhered for the incidents\r\nin his play. The tragedy was carried across to Germany by the English\r\nactors who visited that country in the last years of the sixteenth and\r\nthe earlier part of the seventeenth century, and thus, while it was\r\nitself derived from a German source, it greatly influenced, if it did\r\nnot actually give rise to, the treatment of the same theme by the German\r\npopular drama and puppet-play. These were seldom printed, and usually for\r\nthe most part extemporized, keeping all the while more or less closely\r\nto the theme. Scheible in his _Kloster_ (1847), Volume V, gives the\r\nexcellent Ulm piece, and there are marionette versions edited by W. Hamm\r\n(1850; English translation by T. C. H. Hedderwick, 1887), O. Schade\r\n(1856), K. Engel (1874), Bielschowsky (1882), and Kralik and Winter\r\n(1885).\r\n\r\nLessing projected two presentations of the story, and Klinger worked the\r\nsubject into a romance, _Fausts Leben, Thaten, und Höllenfahrt_ (1791;\r\ntranslated into English by George Barrow in 1826). A bombast tragedy was\r\npublished by Klingemann in 1815, whilst Lenau issued his epico-dramatic\r\n_Faust_ in 1836. Heine’s ballet _Der Doctor Faust, ein Tanzpoem_ appeared\r\nin 1851. The libretto for Spohr’s opera (1814) was written by Bernard.\r\n\r\nGoethe’s masterpiece, planned as early as 1774, was given to the world in\r\n1808, but the second part was delayed until 1831.\r\n\r\nGeneral evidence points to 1588 as the date of the first production of\r\nMarlowe’s _Doctor Faustus_, for it seems certain that the ballad of the\r\n_Life and Death of Doctor Faustus the great Conjurer_, entered in the\r\nStationers’ Register, February, 1589, did not precede but was suggested\r\nby the drama. The first extant quarto is 1604, but already it had been\r\nsubjected to more than one revision. Upon the stage _Doctor Faustus_\r\nlong remained popular, and in England, at least, however fragmentary\r\nMarlowe’s tragedy may be it has never been supplemented by any other\r\nliterary handling of its theme. Old Prynne in his _Histriomastix_\r\n(1633) retails an absurd story to the effect that the Devil _in propria\r\npersona_ “appeared on the stage at the _Belsavage_ Playhouse in Queen\r\n_Elizabeth’s_ days” whilst the tragedy was being performed, “the truth\r\nof which I have heard from many now alive who well remember it.” It was\r\nrevived after the Restoration, and on Monday, 26 May, 1662, Pepys and\r\nhis wife witnessed the production at the Red Bull, “but so wretchedly\r\nand poorly done that we were sick of it.” It was being performed at the\r\nTheatre Royal in the autumn of 1675, but no details are recorded. In\r\n1685-6 at Dorset Garden appeared William Mountfort’s _The Life and Death\r\nof Doctor Faustus, Made into a Farce, with the Humours of Harlequin\r\nand Scaramouch_, a queer mixture of Marlowe’s scenes with the Italian\r\n_commedia dell’ arte_. Harlequin was acted by nimble Thomas Jevon, the\r\nfirst English harlequin, and Scaramouch by Antony Leigh, the most\r\nwhimsical of comedians. At the end of the third act after Faustus has\r\nbeen carried away by Lucifer and Mephistopheles, his body is discovered\r\ntorn in pieces. Then “Faustus _Limbs come together. A Dance and Song_.”\r\nThis farce was continually revived with great applause, and during the\r\nwhole of the eighteenth century Faust was the central figure of pantomime\r\nafter pantomime. Nearly forty dramatic versions of the Faust legend might\r\nbe enumerated. Many are wildly romantic and were especially beloved of\r\nthe minor theatres: such are _Faustus_ by G. Soane and D. Terry, produced\r\nat Drury Lane 16 May, 1825, with “O” Smith as Mephistopheles; H. P.\r\nGrattan’s _Faust, or The Demon of the Drachenfels_ performed at Sadlers\r\nWells, 5 September, 1842, with Henry Marston, Mephistopheles, T. Lyon,\r\nFaust, “the Magician of Wittenberg,” Caroline Rankley, Marguerite; T.\r\nW. Robertson’s _Faust and Marguerite_, played at the Princess’s Theatre\r\nin April, 1854: some are operatic; the ever-popular _Faust_ of Gounod,\r\nwith libretto by Barbier and Carré, first seen at the Théâtre Lyrique,\r\nParis, in 1859; and Hector Berlioz’ _The Damnation of Faust_, which,\r\nadapted to the English stage by T. H. Friend, was performed at the Court,\r\nLiverpool, 3 February, 1894; many more are burlesques, descendants\r\nof the eighteenth-century farces, amongst which may be remembered F.\r\nC. Burnard’s _Faust and Marguerite_, S. James, 9 July, 1864; C. H.\r\nHazlewood’s _Faust: or Marguerite’s Mangle_, Britannia Theatre, 25 March,\r\n1867; Byron’s _Little Doctor Faust_ (1877); _Faust in Three Flashes_\r\n(1884); _Faust in Forty Minutes_ (1885); and the most famous of all the\r\ntravesties _Faust Up to Date_, produced at the Gaiety, 30 October, 1888,\r\nwith E. J. Lonnen as Mephistopheles and Florence St. John as Marguerite.\r\nIn France the _Faust_—après Goethe—of Theaulou and Gondelier first seen\r\nat the Nouveautés, 27 October, 1827, had a great success, and in the\r\nfollowing year no less than three pens, Antony Béraud, Charles Nodier,\r\nand Merle, combined to produce a _Faust_ in three acts, the music of\r\nwhich is by Louis Alexandre Piccini, the grandson of Gluck’s famous\r\nrival. In 1858 Adolphe Dennery gave the Parisian stage _Faust_, a “drame\r\nfantastique” in five acts and sixteen tableaux, a drama of the Grattan\r\nschool, effective enough in a lurid Sadlers Wells way, which is, at any\r\nrate, a vein greater dramatists have exploited with profit and applause.\r\n\r\nOf more recent English dramas which have the Faust legend as their theme\r\nthe most striking is undoubtedly the adaptation by W. G. Wills from the\r\nfirst part of Goethe’s tragedy, which was produced at the Lyceum 19\r\nDecember, 1885, with H. H. Conway as Faust; George Alexander, Valentine;\r\nMrs. Stirling, Martha; Miss Ellen Terry, Margaret; and Henry Irving,\r\nMephistopheles. Not merely in view of the masterpieces of Marlowe and\r\nGoethe, but even by the side of theatrical versions of the legend\r\nfrom far lesser men the play itself was naught, a superb pantomime, a\r\nthing helped out by a witches’ kitchen, by a bacchanalia of demons, by\r\nchromo-lithographic effects, by the mechanist and the brushes of Telbin\r\nand Hawes Craven, but it was informed throughout and raised to heights\r\nof greatness, nay, even to awe and terror, by the genius of Irving as\r\nthe red-plumed Mephistopheles, that sardonic, weary, restless figure,\r\nhorribly unreal yet mockingly alert and alive, who dominated the whole.\r\n\r\nTo attempt a comparison between Marlowe and Goethe were not a little\r\nabsurd, and it is superfluous to expatiate upon the supreme merits of\r\neither masterpiece. In Goethe’s mighty and complex work the story is\r\nin truth refined away beneath a wealth of immortal philosophy. Marlowe\r\nadheres quite simply to the chap-book incidents, and yet in all profane\r\nliterature I scarcely know words of more shuddering dread and complete\r\nagony than Faust’s last great speech:\r\n\r\n    Ah, Faustus,\r\n    Now hast thou but one bare hour to live.\r\n    And then thou must be damned perpetually!\r\n\r\nThe scene becomes intolerable. It is almost too painful to be read, too\r\novercharged with hopeless darkness and despair.\r\n\r\nAs it is in some sense at least akin to the Faust story it may not be\r\nimpertinent briefly to mention here an early Dutch secular drama, which\r\nhas been called “one of the gems of Dutch mediæval literature,” _A\r\nMarvellous History of Mary of Nimmegen, who for more than seven years\r\nlived and had ado with the Devil_,[6] printed by William Vorsterman of\r\nAntwerp about 1520. It is only necessary to call attention to a few\r\nfeatures of the legend. Mary, the niece of the old priest Sir Gysbucht,\r\none night meets the Devil in the shape of _Moonen with the single eye_.\r\nHe undertakes to teach her all the secrets of necromancy if she will but\r\nrefrain from crossing herself and change her name to Lena of Gretchen.\r\nBut Mary, who has had a devotion to our Lady, insists upon retaining\r\nat least the M in her new nomenclature, and so becomes Emmekin. “Thus\r\nEmma and Moonen lived at Antwerp at the sign of the Golden Tree in the\r\nmarket, where daily of his contrivings were many murders and slayings\r\ntogether with every sort of wickedness.” Emma then resolves to visit\r\nher uncle, and insists upon Moonen accompanying her to Nimmegen. It is\r\na high holiday and she sees by chance the mystery of _Maskeroon_ on a\r\npageant-waggon in a public square. Our Lady is pleading before the throne\r\nof God for mankind, and Emma is filled with strange remorse to hear such\r\nblessed words. Moonen carries her off, but she falls and is found in a\r\nswoon by the old priest, her uncle. No priest of Nimmegen dared shrive\r\nher, not even the Bishop of Cologne, and so she journeyed to Rome, where\r\nthe Holy Father heard her confession and bade her wear in penitence three\r\nstrong bands of iron fastened upon neck and arms. Thus she returned to\r\nMaestricht to the cloister of the Converted Sinners, and there her sorrow\r\nwas so prevailing and her humility so unfeigned that an Angel in token of\r\nDivine forgiveness removed the irons as she slept.\r\n\r\n    And go ye to Maestricht, an ye be able\r\n    And in the Converted Sinners shall ye see\r\n    The grave of Emma, and there all three\r\n    The rings be hung above her grave.[7]\r\n\r\nMagic and fairy-land loom large in the plays of Robert Greene, whose\r\nplace in English literature rests at least as much upon his prose-tracts\r\nas on his dramas. It seems to me fairly obvious that _The Honourable\r\nHistory of Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_, which almost certainly dates\r\nfrom 1589, although the first quarto is 1594, was composed owing to the\r\nsuccess of Marlowe’s _Doctor Faustus_. Greene was not the man to lose an\r\nopportunity of exploiting fashion, and with his solid British bent I have\r\nno doubt he considered an old English tale of an Oxford magician would be\r\njust as effective as imported legends from Frankfort and Wittenberg. To\r\nsay that the later play is on an entirely different level is not to deny\r\nit interest and considerable charm. But in spite of Bacon’s avowal\r\n\r\n    Thou know’st that I have divèd into hell\r\n    And sought the darkest palaces of fiends;\r\n    That with my magic spells great Belcephon,\r\n    Hath left his lodge and kneeled at my cell,\r\n\r\nhis sorceries are in lighter vein than those of Faustus; moreover neither\r\nhis arts nor the magic of Friar Bungay form the essential theme of the\r\nplay, which also sketches the love of Edward, Prince of Wales (afterwards\r\nEdward I) for Margaret, “the fair Maid of Fressingfield.” It is true\r\nBacon conjures up spirits enough, and we are shown his study at Brasenose\r\nwith the episode of the Brazen Head. It may be noted that Miles, Bacon’s\r\nservant, is exactly the Vice of the Moralities, and at the end he rides\r\noff farcically enough on the Devil’s back, whilst Bacon announces his\r\nintention of spending the remainder of his years in becoming penitence\r\nfor his necromancy and magic.\r\n\r\nIn Greene’s _Orlando Furioso_, 4to, 1594, which is based on Ariosto,\r\ncanto XXIII, we meet Melissa, an enchantress: and in _Alphonsus, King\r\nof Arragon_, 4to, 1599, which is directly imitative of _Tamburlaine_,\r\na sibyl with the classical name Medea, conjures up Calehas “in a white\r\nsurplice and cardinal’s mitre,” and here we also have a Brazen Head\r\nthrough which Mahomet speaks. A far more interesting play is _A Looking\r\nGlasse for London and England_, 4to, 1594, an elaborated Mystery upon\r\nthe history of the prophet Jonah and the repentance of Nineveh. Among\r\nthe characters are a Good Angel, an Evil Angel, and “one clad in\r\nDevil’s attire,” who is soundly drubbed by Adam the buffoon. In 1598\r\nwas published, “As it hath bene sundrie times publikely plaide,” _The\r\nScottish Historic of Iames the fourth, slaine at Flodden. Entermixed\r\nwith a pleasant Comedie, presented by Oboram, King of Fayeries._ But\r\nthe fairies only appear in a species of prose prologue, and in brief\r\ninterludes between the acts.\r\n\r\nGeorge Peele’s charming piece of folk-lore _The Old Wives’ Tale_\r\nintroduces among its quaint commixture of episodes the warlock Sacripant,\r\nson of a famous witch Meroe,[8] who has stolen away and keeps under a\r\nspell the princess Delia. His power depends upon a light placed in a\r\nmagic glass which can only be broken under certain conditions. Eventually\r\nSacripant is overcome by the aid of a friendly ghost, Jack, the glass\r\nbroken, the light extinguished, and the lady restored to her lover and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nOther magicians who appear in various dramas of the days of Elizabeth and\r\nher immediate successors are Brian Sansfoy in the primitive _Sir Clyomon\r\nand Sir Clamydes_, 4to, 1599; the Magician in _The Wars of Cyrus_; Friar\r\nBacon, Friar Bungay, and Jaques Vandermast in Greene’s _Friar Bacon and\r\nFriar Bungay_, Merlin and Proximus in the pseudo-Shakespearean _The Birth\r\nof Merlin_, where the Devil also figures; Ormandini and Argalio in _The\r\nSeven Champions of Christendom_, where we likewise have Calib, a witch,\r\nher incubus Tarpax, and Suckabus their clownish son; Comus in Milton’s\r\nmasque; Mago the conjurer with his three familiars Eo, Meo, and Areo in\r\nCokain’s _Trappolin Creduto Principe, Trappolin suppos’d a Prince_, 4to,\r\n1656, excellent light fare, which Nahum Tate turned into _A Duke and No\r\nDuke_ and produced at Drury Lane in November, 1684, and which in one form\r\nor another, sometimes “a comic melodramatic burletta,” sometimes a ballad\r\nopera, sometimes a farce, was popular until the early decades of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nSeeing that actors are “the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time,”\r\nit is not surprising to find that Witchcraft has a very important part\r\nin the theatre of Shakespeare. Setting aside such a purely fairy fantasy\r\nas _A Midsummer-Night’s Dream_, such figures as the “threadbare juggler”\r\nPinch in _The Comedy of Errors_, such scenes as the hobgoblin mask\r\nbeneath Herne’s haunted oak, such references as that to Mother Prat, the\r\nold woman of Brainford, who worked “by charms, by spells, by the figure,”\r\nor the vile abuse by Richard, Duke of Gloucester, of “Edward’s wife, that\r\nmonstrous witch, Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,” we have\r\none historical drama _King Henry VI_, Part II, in which an incantation\r\nscene plays no small part; we have one romantic comedy _The Tempest_, one\r\ntragedy _Macbeth_, the very motives and development of which are due to\r\nmagic and supernatural charms. It must perhaps be remarked that _King\r\nHenry VI_, Part I, is defiled by the obscene caricature of S. Joan of\r\nArc, surely the most foul and abominable irreverence that shames English\r\nliterature. It is too loathsome for words, and I would only point out the\r\nenumeration in one scene where various familiars are introduced of the\r\nmost revolting details of contemporary witch-trials, but to think of such\r\nhorrors in connexion with S. Joan revolts and sickens the imagination.\r\n\r\nIn _King Henry VI_ (Part II) the Duchess of Gloucester employs John Hume\r\nand John Southwell, two priests; Bolingbroke, a conjurer; and Margery\r\nJourdemain, a witch, to raise a spirit who shall reveal the several\r\ndestinies of the King, and the Dukes of Suffolk and Somerset. The scene\r\nis written with extraordinary power and has not a little of awe and\r\nterror. Just as the demon is dismissed ’mid thunder and lightning the\r\nDuke of York with his guards rush in and arrest the sorcerers. Later the\r\ntwo priests and Bolingbroke are condemned to the gallows, the witch in\r\nSmithfield is “burn’d to ashes,” whilst the Duchess of Gloucester after\r\nthree days’ public penance is banished for life to the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nThe incidents as employed by Shakespeare are fairly correct. It is\r\ncertain that the Duchess of Gloucester, an ambitious and licentious\r\nwoman, called to her counsels Margery Jourdemain, commonly known as the\r\nWitch of Eye, Roger Bolingbroke an astrologer, Thomas Southwell, Canon of\r\nS. Stephen’s, a priest named Sir John Hume or Hun, and a certain William\r\nWodham. These persons frequently met in secret, and it was discovered\r\nthat they had fashioned according to the usual mode a wax image of the\r\nKing which they melted before a slow fire. Bolingbroke confessed, and\r\nHume also turned informer; and in 1441 Bolingbroke was placed on a high\r\nscaffold before Paul’s Cross together with a chair curiously carved and\r\npainted, found at his lodging, which was supposed to be an instrument of\r\nnecromancy, and in the presence of Cardinal Beaufort of Winchester, Henry\r\nChicheley, Archbishop of Canterbury, and an imposing array of bishops,\r\nhe was compelled to make abjuration of his wicked arts. The Duchess of\r\nGloucester, being refused sanctuary at Westminster, was arrested and\r\nconfined in Leeds Castle, near Maidstone. She was brought to trial with\r\nher accomplices in October, when sentence was passed upon her as has been\r\nrelated above. Margery Jourdemain perished at the stake as a witch and\r\nrelapsed heretic; Thomas Southwell died in prison; and Bolingbroke was\r\nhanged at Tyburn, 18 November.\r\n\r\nIn _The Tempest_ Prospero is a philosopher rather than a wizard, and\r\nAriel is a fairy not a familiar. The magic of Prospero is of the\r\nintellect, and throughout, Shakespeare is careful to insist upon a\r\ncertain detachment from human passions and ambitions. His love for\r\nMiranda, indeed, is exquisitely portrayed, and once—at the base\r\ningratitude of Caliban—his anger flashes forth, but none the less, albeit\r\nsuperintending the fortunes of those over whom he watches tenderly,\r\nand utterly abhorring the thought of revenge, he seems to stand apart\r\nlike Providence divinely guiding the events to the desired issue of\r\nreconciliation and forgiveness. Even so, the situation was delicate to\r\nplace before an Elizabethan audience, and how nobly and with what art\r\ndoes Shakespeare touch upon Prospero’s “rough magic”! In Sycorax we\r\nrecognize the typical witch, wholly evil, vile, malignant, terrible for\r\nmischief, the consort and mistress of devils.\r\n\r\nThere are few scenes which have so caught the world’s fancy as the wild\r\noverture to _Macbeth_. In storm and wilderness we are suddenly brought\r\nface to face with three mysterious phantasms that ride on the wind and\r\nmingle with the mist in thunder, lightning, and in rain. They are not\r\nagents of evil, they are evil; nameless, spectral, wholly horrible. And\r\nthen, after the briefest of intervals, they reappear to relate such\r\nexploits as killing swine and begging chestnuts from a sailor’s wife,\r\nto brag of having secured such talismans as the thumb of a drowned\r\npilot, businesses proper to Mother Demdike or Anne Bishop of Wincanton,\r\nSomerset. Can this change have been intentional? I think not, and its\r\nvery violence and quickness are jarring to a degree. The meeting with\r\nHecate, who is angry, and scolds them “beldames as you are, Saucy and\r\noverbold” does not mend matters, and in spite of the horror when the\r\napparitions are evoked, the ingredients of the cauldron, however noisome\r\nand hideous, are too material for “A deed without a name.” There is a\r\nweakness here, and it says much for the genius of the tragedy that this\r\nweakness is not obtrusively felt. Nevertheless it was upon this that\r\nthe actors seized when for theatrical effect the incantation scenes had\r\nto be “written up” by the interpolation of fresh matter. Davenant also\r\nin his frankly operatic version of _Macbeth_, produced at Dorset Garden\r\nin February, 1672-3 elaborated the witch scenes to an incredible extent,\r\nalthough by ample conveyance from Middleton’s _The Witch_ together with\r\nsongs and dances he was merely following theatrical tradition.[9]\r\n\r\nThere seems no reasonable doubt that _The Witch_ is a later play than\r\n_Macbeth_, but it is only fair to say that the date of _The Witch_\r\nis unknown—it was first printed in 1778 from a manuscript now in the\r\nBodleian—and the date of _Macbeth_ (earlier than 1610, probably 1606) is\r\nnot demonstrably certain. _The Witch_ is a good but not a distinguished\r\nplay. Owing to the incantation scenes and its connexion with _Macbeth_\r\nit has acquired an accidental interest, and an enduring reputation. The\r\nwitches themselves, Hecate and her crew, stand midway between the mystic\r\nNorns of the first scene in _Macbeth_, and the miserable hag of Dekker\r\nin _The Witch of Edmonton_; they are just a little below the Witches in\r\n_Macbeth_ as they appear after the opening lines. There is a ghastly\r\nfantasy in their revels which is not lessened by the material grossness\r\nof Firestone the clown, Hecate’s son. They raise “jars, jealousies,\r\nstrifes, and heart-burning disagreements, like a thick scurf o’er life,”\r\nand although their figures are often grotesque their power for evil is\r\nnot to be despised. Much of their jargon, their charms and gaucheries\r\ncomplete, are taken word for word from Reginald Scott’s _Discoverie of\r\nWitchcraft_, London, 1584.\r\n\r\nThe village witch, as she appeared to her contemporaries, a filthy old\r\ndoting crone, hunch-backed, ignorant, malevolent, hateful to God and man,\r\nis shown with photographic detail in _The Witch of Edmonton; A known True\r\nStory_ by Rowley, Dekker, and Ford, produced at the Cockpit in Drury Lane\r\nduring the autumn or winter of 1621. It seems to have been very popular\r\nat the time, and not only was it applauded in the public theatre, but it\r\nwas presented before King James at Court. It did not, however, find its\r\nway into print until as late as 1658.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII\r\n\r\nTHE WITCH OF EDMONTON. The First Quarto\r\n\r\n[_face p. 290_]\r\n\r\nThe trial and execution (19 April, 1621) of Elizabeth Sawyer attracted\r\na considerable amount of attention. Remarkable numbers of ballads and\r\ndoggerel songs were made upon the event, detailing her enchantments,\r\nhow she had blighted standing corn, how a ferret and an owl constantly\r\nattended her, and of many demons and familiars who companied with her\r\nin the prison. Not only were these ditties trolled out the day of the\r\nexecution but many were published as broadsides, and sold widely.\r\nAccordingly the Newgate Ordinary hastened to pen _The Wonderfull\r\nDiscoverie of Elizabeth Sawyer, a Witch, Late of Edmonton, Her\r\nConviction, and Condemnation, and Death, Together with the Relation of\r\nthe Divels Accesse to Her, and Their Conference Together_, “Written by\r\nHenry Goodcole, Minister of the Word of God, and her Continual Visiter in\r\nthe Gaole of Newgate,” Published by Authority, 4to, 1621. This tractate\r\nis in the form of a dialogue, question and answer, between Goodcole and\r\nthe prisoner, who makes ample confession of her crimes.\r\n\r\nIn some ways _The Witch of Edmonton_ is the most interesting and valuable\r\nof the witch dramas, because here we have the hag stripped of the least\r\nvestige of glamour and romance presented to us in the starkest realism.\r\nWe see her dwelling apart in a wretched hovel, “shunned and hated like\r\na sickness,” miserably poor, buckl’d and bent together, dragging her\r\npalsied limbs wearily through the fields, as she clutches her dirty rags\r\nround her withered frame. And if she but dare to gather a few dried\r\nsticks in a corner she is driven from the spot with hard words and blows.\r\nWhat wonder her mouth is full of cursing and revenge?\r\n\r\n                      ’Tis all one\r\n    To be a witch as to be counted one.\r\n\r\nThen appears the Black Dog and seals a contract with her blood. She\r\nblights the corn and sends a murrain on the cattle of her persecutors;\r\nhere a horse has the glanders, there a sow casts her farrow; the maid\r\nchurns butter nine hours and it will not come; above all a farmer’s wife,\r\nwhom she hates, goes mad and dies in frantic agony; mischief and evil\r\nrun riot through the town. But presently her familiar deserts her, she\r\nfalls into the hands of human justice, and after due trial is dragged to\r\nTyburn shrieking and crying out in hideous despair. It is a sordid and a\r\nterrible, but one cannot doubt, a true picture.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that in this drama[10] Frank Thorney, a most subtle and\r\nminute study of weakness and degeneracy, is wholly Ford’s. Frank Thorney\r\nmay be closely paralleled with Giovanni in _’Tis Pity She’s a Whore_.\r\nWinnifride, too, has all the sentimental charm of Ford’s heroines,\r\nAnnabella and Penthea.\r\n\r\nCarter is unmistakably the creation of Dekker. Simon Eyre and Orlando\r\nFriscobaldo are the same hearty, bluff, hospitable, essentially honest\r\nold fellows. To Dekker also I would assign Mother Sawyer herself.\r\n\r\nRowley’s hand is especially discernible in the scenes where Cuddy Banks\r\nand the clowns make their appearance.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that Elizabeth Sawyer figures in Caulfield’s\r\n_Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters of Remarkable Persons_, 1794; and she\r\nis also referred to in Robinson’s _History and Antiquities of the Parish\r\nof Edmonton_ with a woodcut “from a rare print in the collection of W.\r\nBeckford, esq.”\r\n\r\nA second drama which was also actually founded upon a contemporary trial\r\nis Heywood and Brome’s _The Late Lancashire Witches_, “A Well Received\r\nComedy” produced at the Globe in 1634.[11] In the previous year, 1633, a\r\nnumber of trials for Witchcraft had drawn the attention of all England to\r\nPendle Forest. A boy, by name Edmund Robinson, eleven years of age, who\r\ndwelt here with his father, a poor wood-cutter, told a long and detailed\r\nstory which led to numerous arrests throughout the district. Upon All\r\nSaints’ Day when gathering “bulloes” in a field he saw two greyhounds,\r\none black, the other brown, each wearing a collar of gold. They fawned\r\nupon him, and immediately a hare rose quite near at hand. But the dogs\r\nrefused to course, whereupon he beat them with a little switch, and\r\nthe black greyhound started up in the shape of an old woman whom he\r\nrecognized as Mother Dickenson, a notorious witch, and the other as a\r\nlittle boy whom he did not know. The beldame offered him money, either to\r\nbuy his silence or as the price of his soul, but he refused. Whereupon\r\ntaking something like a Bridle “that gingled” from her pocket she threw\r\nit over the little boy’s head and he became a white horse. Seizing young\r\nRobinson in her arms they mounted and were conveyed with the utmost speed\r\nto a large house where had assembled some sixty other persons. A bright\r\nfire was burning on the hearth with roast meat before it. He was invited\r\nto partake of “Flesh and Bread upon a Trencher and Drink in a Glass,”\r\nwhich he tasted, but at once rejected. He was next led into an adjoining\r\nbarn where seven old women were pulling at seven halters that hung from\r\nthe roof. As they tugged large pieces of meat, butter in lumps, loaves\r\nof bread, black puddings, milk, and all manner of rustic dainties fell\r\ndown into large basins which were placed under the ropes. When the seven\r\nhags were tired their places were taken by seven others. But as they\r\nwere engaged at their extraordinary task their faces seemed so fiendish\r\nand their glances were so evil that Robinson took to his heels. He was\r\ninstantly pursued, and he saw that the foremost of his enemies was a\r\ncertain Mother Lloynd. But luckily for himself two horsemen, travellers,\r\ncame up, whereupon the witches vanished. A little later when he was sent\r\nin the evening to fetch home two kine, a boy met him in the dusk and\r\nfought him, bruising him badly. Looking down he saw that his opponent had\r\na cloven foot, whereupon he ran away, only to meet Mother Lloynd with a\r\nlantern in her hand. She drove him back and he was again mauled by the\r\ncloven-footed boy.[12]\r\n\r\nSuch was the story told to the justices and corroborated by Robinson’s\r\nfather. A reign of terror ensued. Mother Dickenson and Mother Lloynd were\r\nat once thrown into jail, and in the next few days more than eighteen\r\npersons were arrested. The informer and his father netted a good sum\r\nby going round from church to church to point out in the congregations\r\npersons whom he recognized as having been in the house and barn to which\r\nhe was led. A little quiet blackmail of the wealthier county families,\r\nthreats to disclose the presence of various individuals at the witches’\r\nfeast, brought in several hundreds of pounds.\r\n\r\nThe trial took place at Lancaster Assizes and seventeen of the accused\r\nwere incontinently found guilty. But the judge, completely dissatisfied\r\nwith so fantastic a story, obtained a reprieve. Four of the prisoners\r\nwere sent up to London, where they were examined by the Court physicians.\r\nKing Charles himself also questioned one of these poor wretches and,\r\ndiscerning that the whole history was a fraud, forthwith pardoned all who\r\nhad been involved. Meantime Dr. John Bridgeman, the Bishop of Chester,\r\nhad also been holding a special inquiry into the case. Young Robinson\r\nwas lodged separately, being allowed to hold no communication with his\r\nrelatives, and when closely interrogated he gave way and confessed that\r\nthe scare from beginning to end had been manœuvred by his father, who\r\ncarefully coached him in his lies. In spite of this fiasco the talk did\r\nnot die down immediately, and there were many who continued to maintain\r\nthat Mother Dickenson was indeed a witch, however false the evidence on\r\nthis occasion might be. It must be remembered, moreover, that twenty-two\r\nyears before, in the very same district, a coven of thirteen witches, of\r\nwhom the chief was Elizabeth Demdike, had been brought to justice, “at\r\nthe Assizes and Generall Gaole-Delivery, holden at Lancaster, before Sir\r\nEdward Bromley and Sir James Eltham.” Old Demdike herself—she was blind\r\nand over eighty years of age—died in prison, but ten of the accused were\r\nexecuted, and the trial, which lasted two days, occasioned a tremendous\r\nstir.\r\n\r\nIt seems not at all improbable that Heywood had written a topical play\r\nin 1612 dealing with this first sensational prosecution, and that when\r\npractically the same events repeated themselves in the same place less\r\nthan a quarter of a century after he and the ever-ready Brome fashioned\r\nanew the old scenes. In the character of the honourable country-gentleman\r\nMaster Generous, whose wife is discovered to be guilty of Witchcraft,\r\nthere is something truly noble, and his tender forgiveness of her crime\r\nwhen she repents is touched with the loving pathos that informs _A\r\nWoman Kilde with Kindnesse_, whilst his agony at her subsequent relapse\r\nis very real, although Heywood has wisely refrained from any attempt\r\nto show a broken heart save by a few quite simple but poignant words.\r\nThe play as a whole is a faithful picture of country life, homely\r\nenough, yet not without a certain winsome beauty. The comic episodes\r\nare sufficiently broad in their humour; we have a household turned\r\ntopsy-turvy by enchantment, a wedding-breakfast bewitched: the kitchen\r\ninvaded by snakes, bats, frogs, beetles, and hornets, whilst to cap all\r\nthe unfortunate bridegroom is rendered impotent. In Act II we have the\r\nincident of a Boy with a switch (young Edmund Robinson) and the two\r\ngreyhounds. Gammer Dickison carries him off against his will “to a brave\r\nfeast,” where we see the witches pulling ropes for food:\r\n\r\n    Pul for the poultry, foule and fish,\r\n    For emptie shall not be a dish.\r\n\r\nIn Act V the Boy tells Doughty the story of his encounter with the Devil:\r\n“He came to thee like a boy, thou sayest, about thine owne bisnesse?”\r\nthey ask him, and the whole scene meticulously follows the detailed\r\nevidence given before the judge at Lancaster. Of the witches, Goody\r\nDickison, Mal Spencer, Mother Hargrave, Granny Johnson, Meg, Mawd, are\r\nactual individuals who were accused by Robinson; Mrs. Generous alone\r\nis the poet’s fiction. When Robin, the blunt serving-man, refuses to\r\nsaddle the grey gelding she shakes a bridle over his head and using\r\nhim as a horse makes him carry her to the satanical assembly. There is\r\na mill, which is haunted by spirits in the shape of cats, and here a\r\nsoldier undertakes to watch. For two nights he is undisturbed, but on\r\nthe third “_Enter_ Mrs. Generous, Mal, _all the_ Witches and _their\r\nSpirits_ (_at severall dores_).” “_The_ Spirits _come about him with a\r\ndreadfull noise_,” but he beats them thence with his sword, lopping off\r\na tabby’s paw in the hurly-burly. In the morning a hand is found, white\r\nand shapely, with jewels on the fingers. These Generous recognizes as\r\nbeing his wife’s rings, and Mrs. Generous, who is in bed ill, is found to\r\nhave one hand cut off at the wrist. This seals her fate. All the witches\r\nare dragged in and in spite of their charms and bug-words are identified\r\nby several witnesses including the boy who “saw them all in the barne\r\ntogether, and many more, at their feast and witchery.”\r\n\r\nThe play was evidently produced just after the Lancaster Assizes, whilst\r\nfour of the accused were in the Fleet prison, London, for further\r\nexamination, and the King’s pardon had not as yet been pronounced. This\r\nis evident from the Epilogue, which commences:\r\n\r\n    Now while the witches must expect their due,\r\n    By lawfull justice, we appeale to you\r\n    For favourable censure; what their crime\r\n    May bring upon ’em ripens yet of time\r\n    Has not reveal’d. Perhaps great mercy may,\r\n    After just condemnation, give them day\r\n    Of longer life.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to consider in this connexion a drama largely\r\nfounded upon Heywood and Brome, and produced nearly half a century later\r\nat the Duke’s House, Dorset Garden, Shadwell’s _The Lancashire Witches\r\nand Teague o Divelly, the Irish Priest_, which was first seen in the\r\nautumn of 1681 (probably in September). The idea of using magic in a\r\nplay was obviously suggested to Shadwell by his idolized Ben Jonson’s\r\n_Masque of Queens_, performed at Whitehall, 2 February, 1609. In close\r\nimitation of his model Shadwell has further appended copious notes to\r\nActs one, two, three, and five, giving his references for the details of\r\nhis enchantments. In the Preface (4to, 1682) he naïvely confesses: “For\r\nthe magical part I had no hopes of equalling _Shakespear_ in fancy, who\r\ncreated his witchcraft for the most part out of his own imagination (in\r\nwhich faculty no man ever excell’d him), and therefore I resolved to take\r\nmine from authority. And to that end there is not one action in the Play,\r\nnay, scarce a word concerning it, but is borrowed from some antient, or\r\nmodern witchmonger. Which you will find in the notes, wherein I have\r\npresented you a great part of the doctrine of witchcraft, believe it who\r\nwill.” And he has indeed copious citations from Vergil, Horace, Ovid,\r\nPropertius, Juvenal, Tibullus, Seneca, Tacitus, Lucan, Petronius, Pliny,\r\nApuleius, Aristotle, Theocritus, Lucian, Theophrastus; S. Augustine, S.\r\nThomas Aquinas; Baptista Porta; Ben Jonson (_The Sad Shepherd_); from\r\nthe _Malleus Maleficarum_ of James Sprenger, O.P., and Henry Institor\r\n(Heinrich Kramer), written _circa_ 1485-89, from Jean Bodin’s (1520-96)\r\n_La Demonomanie des Sorciers_, 1580; the _Dæmonolatria_, 1595, of Nicolas\r\nRemy; _Disquisitionum Magicarum libri six_ of Martin Delrio, S.J.\r\n(1551-1608); _Historia Rerum Scoticarum_, Paris, 1527, of Hector Boece\r\n(1465-1536); _Formicarius_, 5 vols., Douai, 1602, of John Nider, O.P.\r\n(1380-1438); _De Præstigiis Dæmonum_, 1563, by the celebrated John Weyer,\r\nphysician to the Duke of Cleves; _De Gentibus Septentrionalibus_,[13]\r\nRome, 1555, by Olaus Magnus, the famous Archbishop of Upsala; _Discoverie\r\nof Witchcraft_, 1584, by Reginald Scot; _Dæmonomagia_, by Philip Ludwig\r\nElich, 1607; _De Strigimagis_, by Sylvester Mazzolini, O.P.

Ambrose; _Disputatio\r\nde Magis_ (Frankfort, 1584), by Johan Georg Godelmann; _Tractatus de\r\nStrigiis et Lamiis_ of Bartolommeo Spina, O.P.; the _Decretum_ (about\r\n1020) of Burchard, Bishop of Worms; the _De Sortilegiis_ (Lyons, 1533)\r\nof Paolo Grilland; the _De Occulta Philosophia_ (Antwerp, 1531) of\r\nCornelius Agrippa; the _Apologie pour tous les Grands Hommes qui ont\r\neste faussement supconnez de Magie_ (1625) of Gabriel Naudé, librarian\r\nto Cardinal Mazarin; _De Subtilitate_ (libri XXI, Nuremberg, 1550) of\r\nGirolamo Cardano, the famous physician and astrologer; _De magna et\r\nocculta Philosophia_ of Paracelsus; _IIII Livres des Spectres_ (Angers,\r\n1586) by Pierre le Loyer, Sieur de Brosse, of which Shadwell used the\r\nEnglish version (1605) _A treatise of Specters_ ... translated by Z.\r\nJones.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that no less than forty-one authors, authorities on\r\nmagic, are quoted by Shadwell in these notes, whilst not infrequently the\r\nsame author is cited again and again, and extracts of some length, not\r\nmerely general references, are given.\r\n\r\nBut for all this parade of learning, perchance because of all this parade\r\nof learning, Shadwell’s witch scenes are intolerably clumsy, they are\r\ngross without being terrible. Shadwell was a clever dramatist, he was\r\nable to draw a character, especially a crank, with quite remarkable\r\nvigour, and his scenes are a triumph of photographic realism. True, he\r\ncould not discriminate and select; he threw his world _en masse_ higgledy\r\npiggledy on to the stage, and as even in the reign of the Merry Monarch\r\nthere were a few tedious folk about, so now and again—but not very\r\noften—one chances upon heavy passages in Shadwell’s robust comedies. On\r\nthe other hand _The Sullen Lovers_, _Epsom Wells_, _The Virtuoso, Bury\r\nFair_, _The Squire of Alsatia_, _The Volunteers_, in fact all his native\r\nplays, are full of bustle and fun, albeit a trifle riotous and rude\r\nas the custom was. Dryden, who very well knew what he was about, for\r\npurposes of his own cleverly dubbed Shadwell dull. And dull he has been\r\ndubbed ever since by those who have not read him. But Shadwell had not a\r\nspark of poetry in his whole fat composition. And so his witches become\r\nfarcical, yet farcical in a grimy unpleasant way, for we are spared\r\nnone of the loathsome details of the Sabbat, and should anyone object,\r\nwhy, there is the authority of Remy or Guazzo, the precise passage from\r\nPrierias or Burchard to support the author. Indeed we feel that these\r\nwitches are very real in spite of their materialism. They present a clear\r\npicture of one side of the diabolic cult, however crude and crass.\r\n\r\nEven so, these incantation scenes are not, I venture to think, the worst\r\nthing in the play. The obscene caricature of the Catholic priest, Teague\r\no Divelly, is frankly disgusting beyond words. He is represented as\r\nignorant, idle, lecherous, a liar, a coward, a buffoon, too simiously\r\ncunning to be a fool, too basely mean to be a villain. It is a filthy\r\npiece of work, malignant and harmful prepense.[14]\r\n\r\nBut Shadwell showed scant respect for the Protestants too, since Smerk,\r\nSir Edward Hartfort’s chaplain, is described as “foolish, knavish,\r\npopish, arrogant, insolent; yet for his interest, slavish.”\r\n\r\nIt is hardly a matter for surprise that after the play had been in the\r\nactors’ hands about a fortnight complaints from such high quarters were\r\nlodged with Charles Killigrew, the Master of the Revels, that he promptly\r\nsent for the script, which at first he seems to have passed carelessly\r\nenough, and would only allow the rehearsals to proceed on condition\r\nthat a quantity of scurrilous matter was expunged. Even so the dialogue\r\nis sufficiently offensive and profane. There was something like a riot\r\nin the theatre at the first performance, and the play was as heartily\r\nhissed as it deserved. Yet it managed to make a stand: those were the\r\ndays of the Third Exclusion Bill and rank disloyalty, but the tide was\r\non the turn, a rebel Parliament had been dissolved on the 28th March, on\r\nthe 31st of August Stephen College, a perjured fanatic doubly dyed in\r\ntreason and every conceivable rascality, had met his just reward on the\r\ngallows, whilst the atrocious Shaftesbury himself was to be smartly laid\r\nby the heels in the November following. That part of the dialogue which\r\nwas not allowed to be spoken on the stage Shadwell has printed in italic\r\nletter,[15] and so we plainly see that the censor was amply justified in\r\nhis demands. The political satire is of the muddiest; the railing against\r\nthe Church is lewd and rancorous.\r\n\r\nSuch success as _The Lancashire Witches_ had in the theatre—and it was\r\nnot infrequently revived—was wholly due to the mechanist and the scenic\r\neffects, the “flyings” of the witches, and the music, this last so\r\nprominent a feature that Downes does not hesitate to call it “a kind of\r\nOpera.”\r\n\r\nIn Shadwell’s Sabbat scenes the Devil himself appears, once in the form\r\nof a Buck Goat and once in human shape, whilst his satellites adore\r\nhim with disgusting ceremonies. The witches are Mother Demdike, Mother\r\nDickenson, Mother Hargrave, Mal Spencer, Madge, and others unnamed.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Demdike and Jennet Hargreaves belonged to the first Lancashire\r\nwitch-trials, the prosecutions of 1612; Frances Dickenson and Mal Spencer\r\nwere involved in the Robinson disclosures of 1633; so it is obvious\r\nthat Shadwell has intermingled the two incidents. In his play we have a\r\ncoursing scene where the hare suddenly changes to Mother Demdike; the\r\nwitches raise a storm and carouse in Sir Edward’s cellar something after\r\nthe fashion of Madge Gray, Goody Price, and Goody Jones in _The Ingoldsby\r\nLegends_; Mal Spencer bridles Clod, a country yokel, and rides him to a\r\nwitches’ festival, where Madge is admitted to the infernal sisterhood;\r\nthe witches in the guise of cats beset a number of persons with horrible\r\nscratchings and miauling, Tom Shacklehead strikes off a grimalkin’s paw\r\nand Mother Hargreave’s hand is found to be missing: “the cutting off the\r\nhand is an old story,” says Shadwell in his notes. It will be seen that\r\nthe later dramatist took many of his incidents from Heywood and Brome,\r\nalthough it is only fair to add that he has also largely drawn from\r\noriginal sources.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Restoration was published a play dealing with one of\r\nthe most famous of English sibyls, _The Life of Mother Shipton_. “A New\r\nComedy. As it was Acted Nineteen dayes together with great Applause....\r\nWritten by T[homas] T[homson].” Among the Dramatis Personæ appear Pluto,\r\nthe King of Hell, with Proserpina, his Queen; Radamon, A chief Spirit;\r\nFour other Devils. The scene is “The City of York, or Naseborough Grove\r\nin Yorkshire.” It is a rough piece of work, largely patched together\r\nfrom Middleton’s _A Chaste Maid in Cheapside_ and Massinger’s _The City\r\nMadam_, whilst the episodes in which Mother Shipton is concerned would\r\nseem to be founded on one of the many old chap-books that relate her\r\nmarvellous adventures and prophetic skill. Agatha Shipton (her name\r\nis usually given as Ursula) is complaining of her hard lot when she\r\nencounters Radamon, a demon who holds high rank in the court of Dis. He\r\narranges to meet her later, and returns to his own place to boast of his\r\nsuccess. He reappears to her dressed as a wealthy nobleman; he marries\r\nher; and for a while she is seen in great affluence and state. At the\r\ncommencement of Act III she finds herself in her poor cottage again. As\r\nshe laments Radamon enters, he informs her who he really is, and bestows\r\nupon her magical powers. Her fame spreads far and wide, and as popular\r\nstory tells, the abbot of Beverley in disguise visits her to make trial\r\nof her art. She at once recognizes him, and foretells to his great\r\nchagrin the suppression of the monasteries with other events. In the end\r\nMother Shipton outwits and discomforts the devils who attempt to seize\r\nher, she is vouchsafed a heavenly vision, and turns to penitence and\r\nprayer. The whole thing is a crude enough commixture, of more curiosity\r\nthan value.\r\n\r\nThere are some well-written episodes in Nevil Payne’s powerful tragedy\r\n_The Fatal Jealousie_,[16] produced at Dorset Garden early in August,\r\n1672. Among the characters we have Witch, Aunt of Jasper, the villain\r\nof the piece. Jasper, who is servant to Antonio, applies to his aunt to\r\nhelp him in his malignant schemes. At first he believes she is a genuine\r\nsorceress, but she disabuses him and frankly acknowledges:\r\n\r\n                        I can raise no Devils,\r\n    Yet I Confederate with Rogues and Taylors,\r\n    Things that can shape themselves like Elves,\r\n    And Goblins——\r\n\r\nHer imps _Ranter_ and _Swash_, _Dive_, _Fop_, _Snap_, _Gilt_, and\r\n_Picklock_, are slim lads in masquing habits, trained to trickery. None\r\nthe less they manage an incantation scene to deceive Antonio and persuade\r\nhim that his wife, Caelia, is false. An “Antick Dance of Devils” which\r\nfollows is interrupted by the forcible entry of the Watch. The Aunt shows\r\nJasper a secret hiding-place, whereupon he murders her and conceals the\r\nbody in the hole. He pretends that she was in truth a witch and has\r\nvanished by magic. The Captain of the Watch, however, had detected her\r\ncharlatanry long before, and presently a demon’s vizor and a domino are\r\nfound on the premises. Later a little boy, who is caught in his devil’s\r\nattire, confesses the impostures, and trembling adds that in one of their\r\nsecret chambers they have discovered their mistress’s corpse stabbed to\r\ndeath. Finally Jasper is unmasked, and only escapes condign punishment by\r\nhis dagger. The character of the Witch is not unlike that of Heywood’s\r\n_Wise Woman of Hogsdon_, although in _The Fatal Jealousie_ the events\r\ntake a tragic and bloody turn. Smith acted Antonio; Mrs. Shadwell,\r\nCaelia; Mrs. Norris, the Witch; and Sandford was famous in the rôle of\r\nJasper.\r\n\r\nThere are incantation scenes in Dryden’s tragedies, but these hardly come\r\nwithin our survey, as the magicians are treated romantically, one might\r\neven say decoratively, and certainly here no touch of realism is sought\r\nor intended. We have the famous episode in _The Indian-Queen_ (produced\r\nat the Theatre Royal in January, 1663-4), when Zempoalla seeks Ismeron\r\nthe prophet who raises the God of Dreams to prophesy her destiny;[17]\r\nin the fourth act of _Tyrannick Love_ (Theatre Royal, June, 1669), the\r\nscene is an Indian cave, where at the instigation of Placidius the\r\nmagician Nigrinus raises a vision of the sleeping S. Catharine, various\r\nastral spirits appear only to fly before the descent of Amariel, the\r\nSaint’s Guardian-Angel; in _Œdipus_, by Dryden and Lee (Dorset Garden,\r\nDecember, 1678), Teresias plays a considerable part, and Act III is\r\nmainly concerned with a necromantic spell that raises the ghost of Laius\r\nin the depths of a hallowed grove. In _The Duke of Guise_, moreover\r\n(Theatre Royal, December, 1682), there is something of real horror in the\r\nfigures of Malicorne and his familiar Melanax, and the scene[18] when the\r\nmiserable wizard, whose bond is forfeit, is carried shrieking to endless\r\nbale, cannot be read without a shudder even after the last moments of\r\nMarlowe’s _Faustus_. Act IV of Lee’s _Sophonisba_ (Theatre Royal, April,\r\n1675) commences with the temple of Bellona, whose priestesses are shown\r\nat their dread rites. Cumana is inspired by the divinity, she raves in\r\nfury of obsession, there is a dance of spirits, and various visions are\r\nevoked.\r\n\r\nIn Otway’s curious rehandling of _Romeo and Juliet_ which he Latinized\r\nas _The History and Fall of Caius Marius_ produced at Dorset Garden in\r\nthe autumn of 1679, the Syrian witch Martha only appears for a moment to\r\nprophesy good fortune to Marius and to introduce a dance of spirits by\r\nthe waving of her wand.\r\n\r\nCharles Davenant’s operatic _Circe_ (Dorset Garden, March, 1676-7) is\r\nan amazing distortion of mythological story. There are songs without\r\nnumber, a dance of magicians, storms, dreams, an apparition of Pluto in a\r\nChariot drawn by Black Horses, but all these are very much of the stage,\r\nstagey, born of candle-light and violins, hardly to be endured in cold\r\nprint. Ragusa, the Sorceress in Tate’s _Brutus of Alba: or the Enchanted\r\nLovers_ (Dorset Garden, May, 1678) is a far more formidable figure. Tate\r\nhas managed his magic not without skill, and the conclusion of Act III,\r\nan incantation, was deservedly praised by Lamb. Curiously enough the\r\nplot of _Brutus of Alba_ is the story of Dido and Æneas, Vergil’s names\r\nbeing altered “rather than be guilty of a breach of Modesty,” Tate says.\r\nBut Tate supplied Henry Purcell with the libretto for his opera _Dido\r\nand Æneas_, wherein also witches appear. It must not be forgotten that\r\n_Macbeth_ was immensely popular throughout the whole of the Restoration\r\nperiod, when, as has been noted above, the witch scenes were elaborated\r\nand presented with every resource of scenery, mechanism, dance, song, and\r\nmeretricious ornament. Revival followed revival, each more decorative\r\nthan the last, and the theatre was unceasingly thronged. Duffett\r\nundertook to burlesque this fashion, which he did in an extraordinary\r\nEpilogue to his skit _The Empress of Morocco_, produced at the Theatre\r\nRoyal in the spring of 1674, but for all his japeries _Macbeth_ never\r\nwaned in public favour.\r\n\r\nSpirits in abundance appear in the Earl of Orrery’s unpublished tragedy\r\n_Zoroastres_,[19] the principal character being described as “King of\r\nPersia, the first Magician.” He is attended by “several spirits in black\r\nwith ghastly vizards,” and at the end furies and demons arise shaking\r\ndark torches at the monarch whom they pull down to hell, the sky raining\r\nfire upon them. It was almost certainly never acted, and is the wildest\r\ntype of transpontine melodrama.\r\n\r\nEdward Ravenscroft’s “recantation play” _Dame Dobson, or, The Cunning\r\nWoman_ (produced at Dorset Garden in the early autumn of 1683) is an\r\nEnglish version of _La Devineresse; ou les faux Enchantements_ (sometimes\r\nknown as _Madame Jobin_), a capital comedy by Thomas Corneille and Jean\r\nDonneau de Vise. This French original had been produced in 1679, and\r\nboth the stage-craft and the adroit way in which the various tricks and\r\nconjurations are managed must be allowed to be consummately clever. An\r\nEnglish comedy on a similar theme is _The Wise Woman of Hogsdon_, the\r\nintricacies of which are a triumph of technique. _La Devineresse_ was\r\npublished in 1680 with a frontispiece picturing a grimalkin, a hand of\r\nglory, noxious weeds, two blazing torches and other objects beloved of\r\nnecromancy. There are, moreover, eight folding plates which embellish\r\nthe little book, and these have no small interest as they depict\r\nscenes in the comedy. But _Dame Dobson_ cannot be accounted a play of\r\nwitchcraft; it is no more than an amusing study of dextrous charlatanry.\r\nThe protagonist herself[20] is of that immortal sisterhood graced by\r\nHeywood’s sibyl, of whom it is said “She is a cunning woman, neither hath\r\nshe her name for nothing, who out of her ignorance can fool so many that\r\nthink themselves wise.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Behn, in her amusing comedy _The Luckey Chance; or, An Alderman’s\r\nBargain_, produced at Drury Lane in the late winter of 1686, 4to, 1687,\r\nhas made some play with pretended magic in the capital scenes where\r\nGayman (Betterton) is secretly brought by the prentice Bredwel (Bowman),\r\ndisguised as a devil, to the house of Lady Fulbank (Mrs. Barry). Here\r\nhe is received by Pert, the maid, who is dressed as an old witch, and\r\nconducted to his inamorata’s embraces. But the whole episode is somewhat\r\nfarcically treated, and it is, of course, an elaborate masquerade for the\r\nsake of an intrigue.[21]\r\n\r\nShadwell in 1681 took Witchcraft seriously, and notwithstanding the\r\nhalf-hearted disclaimer in his address “To the Reader” that prefaces\r\n_The Lancashire Witches_ I think he was sensible enough to recognize the\r\ntruth which lies at the core of the matter in spite of the grotesqueness\r\nof the formulæ and spells doting hags and warlocks are wont to employ.\r\nWitchcraft was still a capital offence when some fifteen years later\r\nCongreve lightly laughed it out of court. Foresight (_Love for Love_),\r\n“an illiterate old Fellow, peevish and positive, superstitious, and\r\npretending to understand Astrology, Palmistry, Phisiognomy, Omens,\r\nDreams, etc.,” is in close confabulation with his young daughter’s Nurse,\r\nwhen Angelica his niece trips in to ask the loan of his coach, her\r\nown being out of order. He says no, and presses her to remain at home,\r\nmuttering to himself some old doggerel which bodes no good to the house\r\nif all the womenfolk are gadding abroad. The lady fleers him, twits him\r\nwith jealousy of his young wife: “Uncle, I’m afraid you are not Lord\r\nof the Ascendant, ha! ha! ha!” He is obstinate in his refusal; and she\r\nretorts: “I can make Oath of your unlawful Midnight Practices; you and\r\nthe Old Nurse there.... I saw you together, through the Key-hole of\r\nthe Closet, one Night, like _Saul_ and the Witch of _Endor_, turning\r\nthe Sieve and Sheers, and pricking your Thumbs to write poor innocent\r\nServants’ Names in Blood about a little Nutmeg-Grater, which she had\r\nforgot in the Caudle-Cup.” “Hussy, Cockatrice,” storms the old fellow\r\nbeside himself with rage. Angelica mocks him even more bitterly, accuses\r\nhim and the Nurse of nourishing a familiar, “a young Devil in the shape\r\nof a Tabby-Cat,” and with a few last thrusts she departs, trilling with\r\nmerriment, in a sedan-chair.\r\n\r\nTo return for a brief space to an earlier generation when it would have\r\nhardly been possible, or at least highly inadvisable, to treat Witchcraft\r\nin this blithesome mood, of two plays that would almost certainly have\r\nbeen of great interest in this connexion we have only the names, _The\r\nWitch of Islington_, acted in 1597, and _The Witch Traveller_, licensed\r\nin 1623.\r\n\r\nIn addition to _The Masque of Queens_, which as has already been\r\nnoted, served to some extent for a model to Shadwell when inditing his\r\nencyclopædic notes on magic, Ben Jonson in that sweet pastoral _The Sad\r\nShepherd_ introduces a Scotch witch, Maudlin. The character is drawn with\r\nvigorous strokes; realism mingles with romance.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarrel scene which opens _The Alchemist_ Face threatens\r\nSubtle:\r\n\r\n                                I’ll bring thee, rogue, within\r\n    The statute of sorcerie, _tricesimo tertio_\r\n    Of Harry the Eight.\r\n\r\nDapper the gull asks Subtle for a familiar, as Face explains (I, 2):\r\n\r\n    Why, he do’s aske one but for cups, and horses,\r\n    A rifling flye: none o’ your great familiars.\r\n\r\nAnd later in order to trick him thoroughly Dol Common appears as the\r\n“Queene of Faerie.” The Queen of Elphin or Elfhame, who is particularly\r\nmentioned in the Scotch witch-trials, seems to be identical with the\r\nFrench Reine du Sabbat. In 1670 Jean Weir confessed: “That when she\r\nkeeped a school at Dalkeith, and teached childering, ane tall woman came\r\nto the declarant’s hous when the childering were there; and that she had,\r\nas appeared to her, ane chyld upon her back, and one or two at her foot;\r\nand that the said woman disyred that the declarant should imploy her to\r\nspick for her to the Queen of Farie, and strik and battle in her behalf\r\nwith the said Queen, (which was her own words).”[22]\r\n\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher afford us but few instances of witchcraft in the\r\nmany dramas that conveniently go under their names. We have, it is true,\r\na she-devil, Lucifera, in _The Prophetess_, but the incident is little\r\nbetter than clowning. Delphia herself is a severely classical pythoness\r\nfar removed from the Sawyers, Demdikes, and Dickensons Sulpitia, in _The\r\nCustom of the County_ dons a conjurer’s robe and at Hippolita’s bidding\r\nblasts Zenocia almost to death by her spells, but yet she is more bawd\r\nthan witch. Peter Vecchio in _The Chances_, “a reputed wizard,” is as\r\nsharp and cozening a practitioner as Forobosco, the mountebank, a petty\r\npilferer, who is exposed and sent to the galleys at the end of _The Fair\r\nMaid of the Inn_; or Shirley’s Doctor Sharkino[23] whom silly serving-men\r\nconsult about the loss of silver spoons and napkins; or Tomkis’s\r\nAlbumazar; nay, Jonson’s Subtle himself.[24]\r\n\r\nIn Marston’s _Sophonisba_ (4to, 1606) appears Erictho, borrowed from\r\nLucan. The Friar in Chapman’s _Bassy d’Ambois_ (4to, 1607) puts on a\r\nmagician’s habit, and after a sonorous Latin invocation raises the\r\nspirits Behemoth and Cartophylax in the presence of Bussy and Tamyra.\r\n\r\nA far more interesting drama than these is Shirley’s _S. Patrick for\r\nIreland_, acted in Dublin, 1639-40, which has as its theme the conversion\r\nof Ireland by S. Patrick and the opposition of the Druids under their\r\nleader Archimagus. The character of S. Patrick moves throughout with a\r\nquiet spiritual dignity that has true beauty, and the magicians in their\r\nbaffled potency for evil are only less effective. This drama is a work of\r\nstirling merit, to which I would unhesitatingly assign a very high place\r\nin Shirley’s theatre. We are shown the various attempts upon S. Patrick’s\r\nlife: poison is administered in a cup of wine, the Saint drinks and\r\nremains unharmed; Milcho, a great officer, whose servant S. Patrick once\r\nwas, locks him and his friends in a house and fires it. The Christians\r\npass out unscathed through the flames which devour the incendiary. In\r\nthe last scene whilst S. Patrick sleeps Archimagus summons a vast number\r\nof hideous serpents to devour him, but the Apostle of Ireland wakes, and\r\nexpels for ever all venomous reptiles from his isle, whereon the earth\r\ngapes and swallows the warlock alive. Particularly impressive is the\r\narrival of S. Patrick, when as the King and his two sons, his druids\r\nand nobles, are gathered in anxious consultation at the gates of their\r\ntemple, they see passing in solemn procession through the woods a fair\r\ncompany with gleaming crosses, silken banners, bright tapers and incense,\r\nwhat time the sweet music of a hymn strikes upon the ear:\r\n\r\n    Post maris sæui fremitus Iernæ\r\n    (Nauitas cœlo tremulas beante)\r\n    Uidimus gratum iubar enatantes\r\n                    Littus inaurans.\r\n\r\n(Now that we have crossed the fierce waves of ocean to Ireland’s coast,\r\nand Heaven has blessed its poor fearful wanderers, wending our way along\r\nwith joy do we see a sunbeam of light gilding these shores.)\r\n\r\nAs Marlowe’s _Dr. Faustus_ has already been treated in this connexion it\r\nmay not be altogether impertinent very briefly to consider some three\r\nor four other Elizabethan plays in which the Devil appears among the\r\nDramatis Personæ, even if he act no very prominent part. These for the\r\nmost part fluctuate between the semi-serious and merest buffoonery. Thus\r\nthe prologue of _The Merry Devil of Edmonton_ (4to, 1608), in which\r\nthe enchanter Peter Fabell tricks the demon who has come to demand the\r\nfulfilment of his contract, is at the opening managed with due decorum,\r\nbut it soon adopts a lighter, and even trivial, vein. William Rowley’s\r\n_The Birth of Merlin, or The Childe hath found his Father_ (not printed\r\nuntil 1662) is a curious medley of farce and romance, informed with a\r\ncertain awkward vigour and not wholly destitute of poetry. Dekker’s _If\r\nit be not good, the Divel is in it_ (4to, 1612), which may be traced\r\nto the old prose _History of Friar Rush_, depicts the exploits of three\r\nlesser fiends who are dispatched to spread their master’s kingdom in\r\nNaples. It is an unequal play, the satire of which falls very flat, since\r\nit is obvious that the poet was not sincere in his extravagant theme.[25]\r\n\r\nBen Jonson’s _The Devil is an Ass_, acted in 1616, is wholly comic. Pug,\r\n“the less devil,” who visits the earth, and engages himself as servant to\r\na Norfolk squire, Fabian Fitzdottrel, is hopelessly outwitted on every\r\noccasion by the cunning of mere mortals. Eventually he finds himself\r\nlodged in Newgate, and in imminent danger of the gallows were he not\r\nrescued by the Vice, Iniquity, by whom he is carried off rejoicing to\r\nthe nether regions. His fate may be compared with that of Roderigo in\r\nWilson’s excellent comedy _Belphegor: or, The Marriage of the Devil_\r\n(produced at Dorset Garden in the summer of 1690), who with his two\r\nattendant devils flies back to his native hell to escape the woes of\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIn _The Devil’s Charter_, however, by Barnaby Barnes (1607), we have\r\nwhat is undoubtedly a perfectly serious tragedy, which if not exactly\r\nmodelled upon, at least owes many hints to Marlowe’s _Faustus_. It is\r\nflamboyant melodrama and wildly unhistorical throughout, a very tophet of\r\ninfernal horror. The chief character is a loathsome caricature of Pope\r\nAlexander VI,[26] and, as we might expect, all the lies and libels of\r\nRenaissance satirists and Protestant pamphleteers are heaped together to\r\nportray an impossible monster of lust and crime. The filthiest scandals\r\nof Burchard, Sanudo, Giustiniani, Filippo Nerli, Guicciardini, Paolo\r\nGiovio, Sannazzaro and the Neapolitans, have been employed with one might\r\nalmost say a scrupulous conscientiousness. The black art, in particular,\r\noccupies a very prominent place in these lurid scenes. Alexander has\r\nsigned a bond with a demon Astaroth, and it is to this contract that all\r\nhis success is ascribed. In Act IV there is a long incantation when the\r\nPope puts on his magical robes, takes his rod and pentacle, and standing\r\nwithin the circle he has traced conjures in strange terms, commencing\r\na Latin exorcism which tails off into mere gibberish. Various devils\r\nappear, and he is shown a vision of Gandia’s murder by Cæsar,[27] with\r\nother atrocities. At the climax of the piece we have the banquet with\r\nCardinal Adrian of Corneto, and whilst the guests talk “The Devill\r\ncommeth and changeth the Popes bottles.” The Borgias are poisoned, and\r\nin a far too protracted “Scena Ultima” Alexander discourses and disputes\r\nfrantically with the demons who appear to mock and torment him. There\r\nis the old device of an ambiguous contract; presently a “Devil like a\r\nPoast” enters winding a horn to summon the unhappy wretch, who raves\r\nand shrieks out meaningless ejaculations as he is dragged away amid\r\nthunder and lightning. This sort of thing pandered to the most brutalized\r\nappetites of the groundlings, and _The Devil’s Charter_ may be summed up\r\nas a disgusting burlesque not without its quota of vile stuff that is so\r\nrepulsive as to be physically sickening.\r\n\r\nUpon a careful consideration of those seventeenth-century plays which\r\nhave Witchcraft as their main theme, and leaving on one side, for our\r\npurpose, the essentially romantic treatment of the subject, however\r\nrealistic some details of the picture may be, it is, I think, beyond\r\ndispute that _The Witch of Edmonton_ in the figure of Mother Sawyer\r\noffers us the best contemporary illustration of the Elizabethan witch.\r\nThe drama itself is one of no ordinary merit and power, whilst the\r\nunderstanding and restraint which set the play apart from its fellows\r\nalso raises it to the level of genuine tragedy. It should be noticed that\r\nwe see a witch, so to speak, in the process of making. Mother Sawyer is\r\nin truth the victim of the prejudices of the village hinds and ignorant\r\nyokels. When she first appears it is merely as a poor old crone driven\r\nto desperation by her brutal neighbours; the farmers declare she is a\r\nwitch, and at length persecution makes her one. She is malignant and evil\r\nenough once the compact with the demon has been confirmed; she longs from\r\nthe first to be revenged upon her enemies and mutters to herself “by\r\nwhat art May the thing called Familiar be purchased?” But, in one sense,\r\nshe is urged and hounded to her destiny, and the authors, although never\r\ndoubting her compact with the powers of darkness, her vile and poisonous\r\nlife, show a detached but very real sympathy for her. It is this touch\r\nof humanity, the pathos and pity of the poor old hag, repulsive, wicked,\r\nand baleful as she may be, which must place _The Witch of Edmonton_ in my\r\nopinion among the greatest and most moving of all Elizabethan plays.\r\n\r\nIt is no pleasant task to turn now to the theatre of the eighteenth\r\ncentury in this connexion. The witch became degraded; she was comic,\r\nburlesqued, buffooned; a mere property for a Christmas pantomime:\r\n_Harlequin Mother Bunch_, _Mother Goose_, _Harlequin Dame Trot_, Charles\r\nDibdin’s _The Lancashire Witches, or The Distresses of Harlequin_[28]\r\nwhose tinsel, music, and mummery drew all the macaronis and cyprians in\r\nLondon to the Circus during the winter of 1782-3.\r\n\r\nSome subtle premonition of the great success of Harrison Ainsworth’s\r\npowerful story _The Lancashire Witches_—for this and the macabre\r\n_Rookwood_ are probably the best of the work of a talented writer now\r\nunduly depreciated and decried—seems to have suggested to the prolific\r\nEdward Fitzball his “Legendary Drama in Three Acts,” _The Lancashire\r\nWitches, A Romance of Pendle Forest_, produced at the Adelphi Theatre,\r\n3 January, 1848. It was quick work, for it was only a month before,\r\n3 December, 1847, that Ainsworth, writing to his friend Crossley of\r\nManchester, states that he has accepted the liberal offer of the _Sunday\r\nTimes_—£1000 and the copyright to revert to the author on the completion\r\nof the work—that his new romance _The Lancashire Witches_ should make\r\nits appearance as a serial in the paper. He had already sketched out\r\nthe plan, and he must have given Fitzball an idea of this, or at least\r\nhave allowed the dramatist the use of some few rough notes, for although\r\nthe play and the novel have little, one might say nothing essential,\r\nin common, the chief character in the theatre, Bess of the Woods, “140\r\nyears old, formerly Abbess of S. Magdalen’s, doomed for her crimes to an\r\nunearthly age,” is none other than the anchoress Isolde de Heton.[29]\r\nThe fourth scene of the second act presents the ruins of Whalley Abbey\r\nby moonlight. During an incantation the picture gradually changes; the\r\nbroken arches form themselves into perfect masonry; the ivy disappears\r\nfrom the windows to show the ruby and gold of coloured glass; the\r\ndecaying altar glitters with piled plate and the gleam of myriad tapers.\r\nA choir of nuns rises from the grave to dance with spectral gallants.\r\nAmong the votaries are Nutter, Demdike, and Chattox “Three Weird Sisters,\r\ndoomed for their frailties to become Witches.” But they utter no word,\r\nand have no part save this in the action. This scene must have proved\r\nextraordinarily effective upon the stage. It owes much to the haunted\r\nconvent in Meyerbeer’s _Robert le Diable_, produced at the Académie\r\nRoyale in November, 1831, and given in a piratical form both at Drury\r\nLane and Covent Garden within a few weeks. Nor is it comparable to its\r\noriginal. In Fitzball’s melodrama O. Smith appeared as Gipsy Dalian, a\r\nnew character; and Miss Faucit (Mrs. Bland) as Bess of the Woods. The\r\nplay, for what it is, a luridly theatrical and Surrey-side sensation,\r\nhas merit; but to speak of it in the same breath as Middleton or even as\r\nBarnes would be absurd.\r\n\r\nShelley’s genius has with wondrous beauty translated for us scenes from\r\nCalderon’s _El Magico Prodigioso_, one of the loveliest songs of the\r\nSpanish nightingale. On another plane, admittedly, but yet, I think,\r\nfar from lacking a simple comeliness of its own and surely not without\r\nmost poignant pathos, is Longfellow’s New England Tragedy _Giles Corey\r\nof the Salem Farms_.[30] The honest sincerity of Cotton Mather, the\r\nbluff irascible heartiness of Corey himself, the inopportune scepticism\r\nof his wife—which to many would seem sound common sense—the hysteria\r\nof Mary Walcot, the villainy of John Gloyd, all these are sketched\r\nwith extraordinary power, a few quiet telling touches which make each\r\ncharacter, individual, alert, alive.\r\n\r\nIn the French theatre we have an early fourteenth-century _Miracle de\r\nNostre Dame de Robert le Dyable_, and in 1505 was acted _Le mystère du\r\nChevalier qui donna sa femme au Diable_, à dix personnages. As one might\r\nwell expect during the long classical period of the drama Witchcraft\r\ncould have found no place in the scenes of the French dramatists. It\r\nwould have been altogether too wild, too monstrous a fantasy. And so it\r\nis not until the 24 floréal, An XIII (11 June, 1805) that a play which\r\ninterweaves sorcery as its theme is seen at the Théâtre français, when\r\n_Les Templiers_ of Raynouard was given there. A few years later _Le\r\nVampire_, a thrilling melodrama by Charles Nodier and Carmouche, produced\r\non 13 August, 1820, was to draw all idle Paris to the Porte-Saint-Martin.\r\nIn 1821 two facile writers quick to gauge the public appetite, Frédéric\r\nDupetit-Mèré and Victor Ducagne, found some favour with _La Sorcière, ou\r\nl’Orphelin écossais_. Alexandre Dumas, and one of his many ghosts Auguste\r\nMaquet, collaborated (if one may use the term) in a grandiose five-act\r\ndrama _Urbain Grandier_, 1850. _La Sorcière Canidie_, a one-act play\r\nby Aurélien Vivie, produced at Bordeaux in 1888 is of little account.\r\n_La Reine de l’Esprit_ (1891) of Maurice Pottecher is founded to some\r\nextent on the _Comte de Gabalis_, whilst the same author’s three-act\r\n_Chacun cherche son Trésor_, “histoire des sorciers” (1899) was not a\r\nlittle helped by the music of Lucien Michelet. There are many excuses\r\nfor passing over with a mere mention _Les Noces de Sathan_ (1892), a\r\n“drama ésoterique,” by Jules Bois, and _Les Basques ou la Sorcière\r\nd’Espelette_, a lyric drama in three acts by Loquin and Mégret de\r\nBelligny, produced at Bordeaux in 1892, has an interest which is almost\r\npurely local. Alphonse Tavan’s _Les Mases_ (sorciers), a legendary drama\r\nof five acts of alternating prose and verse seen in 1897 was helped out\r\nby every theatrical resource, a ballet, chorus, mechanical effects, and\r\nconfident advertisement. Serge Basset’s _Vers le Sabbat_ “évocation de\r\nsorcellerie en un acte” which appeared in the same year need not be\r\nseriously considered. Nor does an elaborate episode “Le Sabbat et la\r\nHerse Infernale,” wherein Mons. Benglia appeared as Satan, that was seen\r\nin the Folies Bergère revue, _Un Soir de Folie_, 1925-6, call for more\r\nthan the briefest passing mention.\r\n\r\nIn more recent days Victor Sardou’s _La Sorcière_ is a violent, but\r\neffective, melodrama. Produced at the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt, 15\r\nDecember, 1903, with De Max as Cardinal Ximenes and Sarah Bernhardt as\r\nthe moresque Zoraya, it obtained a not undeserved success. The locale of\r\nthe tragedy is Toledo, anno domini 1506; Act IV, the Inquisition scene;\r\nand Act V, the square before the Cathedral with the grim pyre ready for\r\nthe torch, were—owing to the genius of a great actress—truly harrowing.\r\nOf course it is very flamboyant, very unbalanced, very unhistorical, but\r\nin its gaudy theatrical way—all the old tricks are there—_La Sorcière_\r\nhad an exciting thrill for those who were content to be unsophisticated\r\nawhile.\r\n\r\nJohn Masefield’s adaptation from the Norwegian of Wiers-Jennsen, _The\r\nWitch_,[31] a drama in four acts, is a very different thing. Here we\r\nhave psychology comparable to that of Dekker and Ford. Nor will the\r\nperformances of Miss Janet Achurch as Merete Beyer and Miss Lillah\r\nMcCarthy as Anne Pedersdotter easily be forgotten. As a picture of the\r\nhorror of Witchcraft in cold Scandinavia, the gloom and depression of\r\nformidable fanaticism engendered by Lutheran dogma and discipline with\r\nthe shadow of destiny lowering implacably over all, this is probably the\r\nfinest piece of work dealing in domestic fashion with the warlock and the\r\nsorceress that has been seen on the English stage since the reign of wise\r\nKing James three hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n[1] The _Floralia_, the most wanton of Roman festivals, commenced on\r\nthe fourth day before the Kalends of May, and during these celebrations\r\nthe spectators insisted that the _mimæ_ should play naked, “agebantur\r\n[_Floralia_] a meretricibus ueste exutis omni cum uerborum licentia,\r\nmotuumque obscænitate,” says the old commentator on Martial I, 1.\r\n“Lasciui Floralia laeta theatri” Ausonius names them, _De Feriis\r\nRomanis_, 25. Lactantius, _De Institutionibus Diuinis_, I, 20, writes:\r\n“Celebrantur ergo illi ludi cum omni lasciuia, conuenientes memoriæ\r\nmeretricis. Nam praeter uerborum licentiam, quibus obscænitas omnis\r\neffunditur; exuuntur etiam uestibus populo flagitante meretrices;\r\nquæ tunc mimorum funguntur officio; et in conspectu populi usque ad\r\nsatietatem impudicorum luminum cum pudendis motibus detinentur.” Both S.\r\nAugustine and Arnobius reprehend the lewdness of these naked dances. At\r\nSens during the Feast of Fools, when every licence prevailed, men were\r\nled in procession _nudi_. Warton (_History of English Poetry_, by T.\r\nWarton, edited by W. C. Hazlitt, 4 vols., 1871), II, 223, states that in\r\nthe Mystery Plays “Adam and Eve are both exhibited on the stage naked,\r\nand conversing about their nakedness; this very pertinently introduces\r\nthe next scene, in which they have coverings of fig-leaves.” In a\r\nstage-direction of the Chester Plays we find: “Statim nudi sunt.... Tunc\r\nAdam et Eua cooperiant genitalia sua cum foliis.” Chambers, _The Mediæval\r\nStage_, II, 143, doubts whether the players were actually nude, and\r\nsuggests a suit of white leather. Warton, however, is probably right.\r\n\r\n[2] Phales was an early deity, very similar to Priapus, and closely\r\nassociated with the Bacchic mysteries.

Upon the revival of\r\nthe play immediately after the Restoration the witch scenes were given\r\ngreat theatrical prominence. 7 January, 1667, Pepys declared himself\r\nhighly delighted with the “divertissement, though it be a deep tragedy.”\r\n\r\n[10] _The Witch of Edmonton_ was revived under my direction for two\r\nperformances at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, 24 and 26 April, 1921.\r\nSybil Thorndike played the Witch, Russell Thorndike, the Familiar; Ion\r\nSwinley, Frank Thorney; Edith Evans, Ann Ratcliffe; and Frank Cochrane,\r\nCuddy Banks.\r\n\r\n[11] 4to 1634: _Stationers’ Register_, 28 October.\r\n\r\n[12] In a famous Scotch trial for witchcraft, 1661, Jonet Watson of\r\nDalkeith confessed “that the Deivill apeired vnto her in the liknes of\r\nane prettie boy, in grein clothes.”\r\n\r\n[13] Liber III. _De Magis et Maleficis Finnorum._\r\n\r\n[14] Tegue o’ Divelly was acted by Antony Leigh, the most famous comedian\r\nof his day, and an intimate friend of Shadwell.\r\n\r\n[15] Curiously enough Halliwell in _The Poetry of Witchcraft_, a private\r\nreprint of Heywood and Shadwell’s plays, 80 copies only, 1853, has not\r\nreproduced the italic letter but gives all the dialogue in roman to the\r\ngreat detriment of this edition.\r\n\r\n[16] Licensed for printing 2 November, 1672, and published quarto with\r\ndate 1673.\r\n\r\n[17] At a later revival Ismeron’s recitative “Ye twice ten hundred\r\nDeities” was set by Purcell.\r\n\r\n[18] Dryden’s.

It must be confessed\r\nthat she has managed her scenes with more wit and spirit than the older\r\ndramatist, whose charming verse is perhaps too seriously poetical for the\r\nactual situation.\r\n\r\n[22] George Sinclar, _Satan’s Invisible World Discovered_, 1685.

Revived at the Court, 29 October,\r\n1913, when it ran for a month, and was afterwards included in the\r\nsubsequent three weeks’ repertory season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Bibliography does not aim at anything beyond presenting a brief and\r\nconvenient hand-list of some of the more important books upon Witchcraft.\r\nIt does not even purport to give all those monographs to which reference\r\nis made in the body of this study. A large number of books I have\r\nthought it superfluous to include. Thus I have omitted general works of\r\nreference such as the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, Du Cange’s _Glossarium\r\nad scriptores mediæ et infimæ latinitatis_, Dugdale’s _Monasticon_; daily\r\ncompanions such as the Missal, the Breviary, the Bible; Homer, Vergil,\r\nHorace, Ovid, Petronius, Lucan; Shakespeare, Marlowe, Ford, Dryden,\r\nBurton’s _Anatomy of Melancholy_, and English classics; those histories\r\nwhich are on every library shelf, Gibbon, Lingard, Ranke; and such\r\nhistories as the _Cambridge Modern History_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have of purpose included various books which may not\r\nseem at first sight to have much connexion with Witchcraft, although they\r\nare, as a matter of fact, by no means impertinent. In order to appreciate\r\nthis vast subject in all its bearings, even the desultory or amateur\r\ninvestigator should at least be fairly grounded in theology, philosophy,\r\nand psychology. The student must be a capable theologian.\r\n\r\nI have devoted some particular attention to the works of the\r\ndemonologists, now almost universally neglected, but a close study of\r\nwhich is essential to the understanding of occultism and the appreciation\r\nof the grave dangers that may lurk there.\r\n\r\nI am only too conscious of the plentiful lacunæ in this Bibliography.\r\nHowever, to attempt anything like a complete catalogue—if, indeed, it\r\nwere possible to essay so illimitable a task—would involve the listing of\r\nvery many thousands of books, and would itself require no inconsiderable\r\na tale of volumes.\r\n\r\nI need hardly point out that side by side with works of the highest\r\nimportance it has been found necessary to include a few of no great\r\nvalue, which yet have their use to illustrate some one point or special\r\nphase.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL\r\n\r\nCAILLET, ALBERT L. _Manuel bibliographique des sciences psychiques\r\nou occultes, science des Mages, hermétique, astrologie, Kabbale,\r\nFrancmaçonnerie, médecine ancienne, mesmérisme, sorcellerie,\r\nsingularités, etc._ 3 vols.

A new type of vision on the whole\r\nperspective of historical science.”\r\n\r\nThe _Chicago Evening Post_: “The scope is to be comprehensive and\r\nthe performance so far has been brilliant. Mr. Knopf will have done\r\nthe public an invaluable service by thus putting at its disposal an\r\nauthoritative history of the world, entirely in English, each field\r\ncovered by a man who has mastered it.... The History of Civilization\r\nought to prove a force not only in the spread of knowledge, but in the\r\npropagation of international good-will.”\r\n\r\nJames T. Shotwell writes: “The History of Civilization, edited by Mr.\r\nOgden of Magdalene College, Cambridge, marks a new stage in the History\r\nof History. Hitherto we have had co-operative surveys of sections of\r\nEuropean History, but they have all suffered from limitations of space.\r\nThe various contributors have been obliged by the editors to put into a\r\nchapter material which ordinarily would call for a whole volume. This\r\ngreat History leaves the author a real freedom to cover his subject\r\nadequately, and once this is granted, the chief editorial problem is to\r\nsecure the outstanding authority in the particular subject. The list of\r\nauthors in this series could hardly be bettered. Each writer can bring a\r\ndistinct contribution apart from the data with which he deals; each great\r\nphase of human evolution is presented here in a masterful survey and fits\r\nwell into the general synthesis.\r\n\r\n“Turning from the special volumes to the work as a whole, one finds\r\na conception of history which corresponds to the demands of those\r\ninterested in the social and intellectual development of Europe, while\r\nalongside of it the political story still furnishes the traditional\r\nframework. It is a living picture of a vast movement, splendidly\r\nconceived and sure to be adequately executed.”",
