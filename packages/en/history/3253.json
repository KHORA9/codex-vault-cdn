On this point, the present rebellion\r\nbrought our republic to a severe test, and the Presidential election,\r\noccurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not a little\r\nto the strain.... The strife of the election is but human nature\r\npractically applied to the facts in the case. What has occurred in this\r\ncase must ever occur in similar cases. Human nature will not change. In\r\nany future great national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall\r\nhave as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as good.\r\nLet us therefore study the incidents in this as philosophy to learn\r\nwisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be avenged.... Now that the\r\nelection is over, may not all having a common interest reunite in a\r\ncommon fort to save our common country? For my own part, I have striven\r\nand shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way. So long as I\r\nhave been here, I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom.\r\nWhile I am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a re-election\r\nand duly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my\r\ncountrymen to a right conclusion, as I think for their own good, it adds\r\nnothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or\r\npained by the result.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech has not attracted much general attention, yet it is in a\r\npeculiar degree both illustrative and typical of the great statesman who\r\nmade it, alike in its strong common-sense and in its lofty standard of\r\nmorality. Lincoln's life, Lincoln's deeds and words, are not only of\r\nconsuming interest to the historian, but should be intimately known to\r\nevery man engaged in the hard practical work of American political life.\r\nIt is difficult to overstate how much it means to a nation to have as\r\nthe two foremost figures in its history men like Washington and Lincoln.\r\nIt is good for every man in any way concerned in public life to feel\r\nthat the highest ambition any American can possibly have will be\r\ngratified just in proportion as he raises himself toward the standards\r\nset by these two men.\r\n\r\nIt is a very poor thing, whether for nations or individuals, to advance\r\nthe history of great deeds done in the past as an excuse for doing\r\npoorly in the present; but it is an excellent thing to study the history\r\nof the great deeds of the past, and of the great men who did them, with\r\nan earnest desire to profit thereby so as to render better service in\r\nthe present. In their essentials, the men of the present day are much\r\nlike the men of the past, and the live issues of the present can be\r\nfaced to better advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the\r\nleaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past. Such a study of\r\nLincoln's life will enable us to avoid the twin gulfs of immorality and\r\ninefficiency--the gulfs which always lie one on each side of the careers\r\nalike of man and of nation. It helps nothing to have avoided one if\r\nshipwreck is encountered in the other. The fanatic, the well-meaning\r\nmoralist of unbalanced mind, the parlor critic who condemns others but\r\nhas no power himself to do good and but little power to do ill--all\r\nthese were as alien to Lincoln as the vicious and unpatriotic\r\nthemselves. His life teaches our people that they must act with wisdom,\r\nbecause otherwise adherence to right will be mere sound and fury without\r\nsubstance; and that they must also act high-mindedly, or else what seems\r\nto be wisdom will in the end turn out to be the most destructive kind of\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\nThroughout his entire life, and especially after he rose to leadership\r\nin his party, Lincoln was stirred to his depths by the sense of fealty\r\nto a lofty ideal; but throughout his entire life, he also accepted human\r\nnature as it is, and worked with keen, practical good sense to achieve\r\nresults with the instruments at hand. It is impossible to conceive of a\r\nman farther removed from baseness, farther removed from corruption, from\r\nmere self-seeking; but it is also impossible to conceive of a man of\r\nmore sane and healthy mind--a man less under the influence of that\r\nfantastic and diseased morality (so fantastic and diseased as to be in\r\nreality profoundly immoral) which makes a man in this work-a-day\r\nworld refuse to do what is possible because he cannot accomplish the\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth volume of Lecky's History of England, the historian draws\r\nan interesting distinction between the qualities needed for a successful\r\npolitical career in modern society and those which lead to eminence in\r\nthe spheres of pure intellect or pure moral effort. He says:\r\n\r\n\"....the moral qualities that are required in the higher spheres\r\nof statesmanship [are not] those of a hero or a saint. Passionate\r\nearnestness and self-devotion, complete concentration of every faculty\r\non an unselfish aim, uncalculating daring, a delicacy of conscience and\r\na loftiness of aim far exceeding those of the average of men, are here\r\nlikely to prove rather a hindrance than an assistance. The politician\r\ndeals very largely with the superficial and the commonplace; his art is\r\nin a great measure that of skilful compromise, and in the conditions\r\nof modern life, the statesman is likely to succeed best who possesses\r\nsecondary qualities to an unusual degree, who is in the closest\r\nintellectual and moral sympathy with the average of the intelligent\r\nmen of his time, and who pursues common ideals with more than common\r\nability.... Tact, business talent, knowledge of men, resolution,\r\npromptitude and sagacity in dealing with immediate emergencies, a\r\ncharacter which lends itself easily to conciliation, diminishes friction\r\nand inspires confidence, are especially needed, and they are more likely\r\nto be found among shrewd and enlightened men of the world than among men\r\nof great original genius or of an heroic type of character.\"\r\n\r\nThe American people should feel profoundly grateful that the greatest\r\nAmerican statesman since Washington, the statesman who in this\r\nabsolutely democratic republic succeeded best, was the very man who\r\nactually combined the two sets of qualities which the historian thus\r\nputs in antithesis. Abraham Lincoln, the rail-splitter, the Western\r\ncountry lawyer, was one of the shrewdest and most enlightened men of the\r\nworld, and he had all the practical qualities which enable such a man to\r\nguide his countrymen; and yet he was also a genius of the heroic type,\r\na leader who rose level to the greatest crisis through which this nation\r\nor any other nation had to pass in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\nSAGAMORE HILL, OYSTER BAY, N. Y., September 22, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\n\"I have endured,\" wrote Lincoln not long before his death, \"a great\r\ndeal of ridicule without much malice, and have received a great deal of\r\nkindness not quite free from ridicule.\" On Easter Day, 1865, the world\r\nknew how little this ridicule, how much this kindness, had really\r\nsignified. Thereafter, Lincoln the man became Lincoln the hero, year by\r\nyear more heroic, until to-day, with the swift passing of those who knew\r\nhim, his figure grows ever dimmer, less real. This should not be. For\r\nLincoln the man, patient, wise, set in a high resolve, is worth far more\r\nthan Lincoln the hero, vaguely glorious. Invaluable is the example of\r\nthe man, intangible that of the hero.\r\n\r\nAnd, though it is not for us, as for those who in awed stillness\r\nlistened at Gettysburg with inspired perception, to know Abraham\r\nLincoln, yet there is for us another way whereby we may attain such\r\nknowledge--through his words--uttered in all sincerity to those who\r\nloved or hated him. Cold, unsatisfying they may seem, these printed\r\nwords, while we can yet speak with those who knew him, and look into\r\neyes that once looked into his. But in truth it is here that we find his\r\nsimple greatness, his great simplicity, and though no man tried less so\r\nto show his power, no man has so shown it more clearly.\r\n\r\nThus these writings of Abraham Lincoln are associated with those of\r\nWashington, Hamilton, Franklin, and of the other \"Founders of the\r\nRepublic,\" not that Lincoln should become still more of the past, but,\r\nrather, that he with them should become still more of the present.\r\nHowever faint and mythical may grow the story of that Great Struggle,\r\nthe leader, Lincoln, at least should remain a real, living American.\r\nNo matter how clearly, how directly, Lincoln has shown himself in his\r\nwritings, we yet should not forget those men whose minds, from their\r\nvarious view-points, have illumined for us his character. As this nation\r\nowes a great debt to Lincoln, so, also, Lincoln's memory owes a great\r\ndebt to a nation which, as no other nation could have done, has been\r\nable to appreciate his full worth. Among the many who have brought about\r\nthis appreciation, those only whose estimates have been placed in these\r\nvolumes may be mentioned here. To President Roosevelt, to Mr. Schurz\r\nand to Mr. Choate, the editor, for himself, for the publishers, and on\r\nbehalf of the readers, wishes to offer his sincere acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nThanks are also due, for valuable and sympathetic assistance rendered in\r\nthe preparation of this work, to Mr. Gilbert A. Tracy, of Putnam, Conn.,\r\nMajor William H. Lambert, of Philadelphia, and Mr. C. F. Gunther, of\r\nChicago, to the Chicago Historical Association and personally to\r\nits capable Secretary, Miss McIlvaine, to Major Henry S. Burrage, of\r\nPortland, Me., and to General Thomas J. Henderson, of Illinois.\r\n\r\nFor various courtesies received, the editor is furthermore indebted to\r\nthe Librarian of the Library of Congress; to Messrs. McClure, Phillips\r\n& Co., D. Appleton & Co., Macmillan & Co., Dodd, Mead & Co., and Harper\r\nBrothers, of New York; to Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Dana, Estes & Co.,\r\nand L. C. Page & Co., of Boston; to A. C. McClure & Co., of Chicago; to\r\nThe Robert Clarke Co., of Cincinnati, and to the J. B. Lippincott Co.,\r\nof Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add that every effort has been made by the\r\neditor to bring into these volumes whatever material may there properly\r\nbelong, material much of which is widely scattered in public libraries\r\nand in private collections. He has been fortunate in securing certain\r\ninteresting correspondence and papers which had not before come into\r\nprint in book form. Information concerning some of these papers had\r\nreached him too late to enable the papers to find place in their proper\r\nchronological order in the set. Rather, however, than not to present\r\nthese papers to the readers they have been included in the seventh\r\nvolume of the set, which concludes the \"Writings.\"\r\n\r\n   [These later papers are, in this etext, re-arranged into chronologic\r\n    order.

L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN: AN ESSAY BY CARL SHURZ\r\n\r\nNo American can study the character and career of Abraham Lincoln\r\nwithout being carried away by sentimental emotions. We are always\r\ninclined to idealize that which we love,--a state of mind very\r\nunfavorable to the exercise of sober critical judgment. It is therefore\r\nnot surprising that most of those who have written or spoken on that\r\nextraordinary man, even while conscientiously endeavoring to draw a\r\nlifelike portraiture of his being, and to form a just estimate of his\r\npublic conduct, should have drifted into more or less indiscriminating\r\neulogy, painting his great features in the most glowing colors, and\r\ncovering with tender shadings whatever might look like a blemish.\r\n\r\nBut his standing before posterity will not be exalted by mere praise of\r\nhis virtues and abilities, nor by any concealment of his limitations\r\nand faults. The stature of the great man, one of whose peculiar charms\r\nconsisted in his being so unlike all other great men, will rather lose\r\nthan gain by the idealization which so easily runs into the commonplace.\r\nFor it was distinctly the weird mixture of qualities and forces in him,\r\nof the lofty with the common, the ideal with the uncouth, of that which\r\nhe had become with that which he had not ceased to be, that made him\r\nso fascinating a character among his fellow-men, gave him his singular\r\npower over their minds and hearts, and fitted him to be the greatest\r\nleader in the greatest crisis of our national life.\r\n\r\nHis was indeed a marvellous growth. The statesman or the military hero\r\nborn and reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure in American history;\r\nbut we may search in vain among our celebrities for one whose origin and\r\nearly life equalled Abraham Lincoln's in wretchedness. He first saw the\r\nlight in a miserable hovel in Kentucky, on a farm consisting of a\r\nfew barren acres in a dreary neighborhood; his father a typical \"poor\r\nSouthern white,\" shiftless and without ambition for himself or his\r\nchildren, constantly looking for a new piece of land on which he might\r\nmake a living without much work; his mother, in her youth handsome and\r\nbright, grown prematurely coarse in feature and soured in mind by daily\r\ntoil and care; the whole household squalid, cheerless, and utterly void\r\nof elevating inspirations... Only when the family had \"moved\" into the\r\nmalarious backwoods of Indiana, the mother had died, and a stepmother,\r\na woman of thrift and energy, had taken charge of the children, the\r\nshaggy-headed, ragged, barefooted, forlorn boy, then seven years old,\r\n\"began to feel like a human being.\" Hard work was his early lot. When a\r\nmere boy he had to help in supporting the family, either on his father's\r\nclearing, or hired out to other farmers to plough, or dig ditches, or\r\nchop wood, or drive ox teams; occasionally also to \"tend the baby,\"\r\nwhen the farmer's wife was otherwise engaged. He could regard it as an\r\nadvancement to a higher sphere of activity when he obtained work in a\r\n\"crossroads store,\" where he amused the customers by his talk over the\r\ncounter; for he soon distinguished himself among the backwoods folk\r\nas one who had something to say worth listening to. To win that\r\ndistinction, he had to draw mainly upon his wits; for, while his thirst\r\nfor knowledge was great, his opportunities for satisfying that thirst\r\nwere wofully slender.\r\n\r\nIn the log schoolhouse, which he could visit but little, he was taught\r\nonly reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic. Among the people\r\nof the settlement, bush farmers and small tradesmen, he found none of\r\nuncommon intelligence or education; but some of them had a few books,\r\nwhich he borrowed eagerly. Thus he read and reread, AEsop's Fables,\r\nlearning to tell stories with a point and to argue by parables; he read\r\nRobinson Crusoe, The Pilgrim's Progress, a short history of the United\r\nStates, and Weems's Life of Washington. To the town constable's he went\r\nto read the Revised Statutes of Indiana. Every printed page that fell\r\ninto his hands he would greedily devour, and his family and friends\r\nwatched him with wonder, as the uncouth boy, after his daily work,\r\ncrouched in a corner of the log cabin or outside under a tree, absorbed\r\nin a book while munching his supper of corn bread. In this manner he\r\nbegan to gather some knowledge, and sometimes he would astonish the\r\ngirls with such startling remarks as that the earth was moving around\r\nthe sun, and not the sun around the earth, and they marvelled where\r\n\"Abe\" could have got such queer notions. Soon he also felt the impulse\r\nto write; not only making extracts from books he wished to remember, but\r\nalso composing little essays of his own. First he sketched these with\r\ncharcoal on a wooden shovel scraped white with a drawing-knife, or on\r\nbasswood shingles. Then he transferred them to paper, which was a scarce\r\ncommodity in the Lincoln household; taking care to cut his expressions\r\nclose, so that they might not cover too much space,--a style-forming\r\nmethod greatly to be commended. Seeing boys put a burning coal on the\r\nback of a wood turtle, he was moved to write on cruelty to animals.\r\nSeeing men intoxicated with whiskey, he wrote on temperance. In\r\nverse-making, too, he tried himself, and in satire on persons offensive\r\nto him or others,--satire the rustic wit of which was not always fit for\r\nears polite. Also political thoughts he put upon paper, and some of\r\nhis pieces were even deemed good enough for publication in the county\r\nweekly.\r\n\r\nThus he won a neighborhood reputation as a clever young man, which he\r\nincreased by his performances as a speaker, not seldom drawing upon\r\nhimself the dissatisfaction of his employers by mounting a stump in the\r\nfield, and keeping the farm hands from their work by little speeches in\r\na jocose and sometimes also a serious vein. At the rude social frolics\r\nof the settlement he became an important person, telling funny, stories,\r\nmimicking the itinerant preachers who had happened to pass by, and\r\nmaking his mark at wrestling matches, too; for at the age of seventeen\r\nhe had attained his full height, six feet four inches in his stockings,\r\nif he had any, and a terribly muscular clodhopper he was. But he\r\nwas known never to use his extraordinary strength to the injury or\r\nhumiliation of others; rather to do them a kindly turn, or to enforce\r\njustice and fair dealing between them. All this made him a favorite in\r\nbackwoods society, although in some things he appeared a little odd,\r\nto his friends. Far more than any of them, he was given not only to\r\nreading, but to fits of abstraction, to quiet musing with himself, and\r\nalso to strange spells of melancholy, from which he often would pass in\r\na moment to rollicking outbursts of droll humor. But on the whole he\r\nwas one of the people among whom he lived; in appearance perhaps even\r\na little more uncouth than most of them,--a very tall, rawboned youth,\r\nwith large features, dark, shrivelled skin, and rebellious hair; his\r\narms and legs long, out of proportion; clad in deerskin trousers, which\r\nfrom frequent exposure to the rain had shrunk so as to sit tightly on\r\nhis limbs, leaving several inches of bluish shin exposed between their\r\nlower end and the heavy tan-colored shoes; the nether garment held\r\nusually by only one suspender, that was strung over a coarse homemade\r\nshirt; the head covered in winter with a coonskin cap, in summer with a\r\nrough straw hat of uncertain shape, without a band.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether he felt himself much superior to his\r\nsurroundings, although he confessed to a yearning for some knowledge\r\nof the world outside of the circle in which he lived. This wish was\r\ngratified; but how? At the age of nineteen he went down the Mississippi\r\nto New Orleans as a flatboat hand, temporarily joining a trade many\r\nmembers of which at that time still took pride in being called \"half\r\nhorse and half alligator.\" After his return he worked and lived in the\r\nold way until the spring of 1830, when his father \"moved again,\" this\r\ntime to Illinois; and on the journey of fifteen days \"Abe\" had to drive\r\nthe ox wagon which carried the household goods. Another log cabin was\r\nbuilt, and then, fencing a field, Abraham Lincoln split those historic\r\nrails which were destined to play so picturesque a part in the\r\nPresidential campaign twenty-eight years later.\r\n\r\nHaving come of age, Lincoln left the family, and \"struck out for\r\nhimself.\" He had to \"take jobs whenever he could get them.\" The first\r\nof these carried him again as a flatboat hand to New Orleans. There\r\nsomething happened that made a lasting impression upon his soul:\r\nhe witnessed a slave auction. \"His heart bled,\" wrote one of his\r\ncompanions; \"said nothing much; was silent; looked bad. I can say,\r\nknowing it, that it was on this trip that he formed his opinion on\r\nslavery. It run its iron in him then and there, May, 1831. I have\r\nheard him say so often.\" Then he lived several years at New Salem,\r\nin Illinois, a small mushroom village, with a mill, some \"stores\" and\r\nwhiskey shops, that rose quickly, and soon disappeared again. It was a\r\ndesolate, disjointed, half-working and half-loitering life, without any\r\nother aim than to gain food and shelter from day to day. He served as\r\npilot on a steamboat trip, then as clerk in a store and a mill; business\r\nfailing, he was adrift for some time. Being compelled to measure his\r\nstrength with the chief bully of the neighborhood, and overcoming him,\r\nhe became a noted person in that muscular community, and won the esteem\r\nand friendship of the ruling gang of ruffians to such a degree that,\r\nwhen the Black Hawk war broke out, they elected him, a young man of\r\ntwenty-three, captain of a volunteer company, composed mainly of roughs\r\nof their kind. He took the field, and his most noteworthy deed of valor\r\nconsisted, not in killing an Indian, but in protecting against his own\r\nmen, at the peril of his own life, the life of an old savage who had\r\nstrayed into his camp.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hawk war over, he turned to politics. The step from the\r\ncaptaincy of a volunteer company to a candidacy for a seat in the\r\nLegislature seemed a natural one. But his popularity, although great\r\nin New Salem, had not spread far enough over the district, and he was\r\ndefeated. Then the wretched hand-to-mouth struggle began again. He \"set\r\nup in store-business\" with a dissolute partner, who drank whiskey while\r\nLincoln was reading books. The result was a disastrous failure and a\r\nload of debt. Thereupon he became a deputy surveyor, and was appointed\r\npostmaster of New Salem, the business of the post-office being so small\r\nthat he could carry the incoming and outgoing mail in his hat. All this\r\ncould not lift him from poverty, and his surveying instruments and horse\r\nand saddle were sold by the sheriff for debt.\r\n\r\nBut while all this misery was upon him his ambition rose to higher aims.\r\nHe walked many miles to borrow from a schoolmaster a grammar with which\r\nto improve his language. A lawyer lent him a copy of Blackstone, and he\r\nbegan to study law.\r\n\r\nPeople would look wonderingly at the grotesque figure lying in the\r\ngrass, \"with his feet up a tree,\" or sitting on a fence, as, absorbed\r\nin a book, he learned to construct correct sentences and made himself\r\na jurist. At once he gained a little practice, pettifogging before a\r\njustice of the peace for friends, without expecting a fee. Judicial\r\nfunctions, too, were thrust upon him, but only at horse-races or\r\nwrestling matches, where his acknowledged honesty and fairness gave his\r\nverdicts undisputed authority. His popularity grew apace, and soon\r\nhe could be a candidate for the Legislature again. Although he called\r\nhimself a Whig, an ardent admirer of Henry Clay, his clever stump\r\nspeeches won him the election in the strongly Democratic district.\r\nThen for the first time, perhaps, he thought seriously of his outward\r\nappearance. So far he had been content with a garb of \"Kentucky jeans,\"\r\nnot seldom ragged, usually patched, and always shabby. Now, he borrowed\r\nsome money from a friend to buy a new suit of clothes--\"store clothes\"\r\nfit for a Sangamon County statesman; and thus adorned he set out for the\r\nstate capital, Vandalia, to take his seat among the lawmakers.\r\n\r\nHis legislative career, which stretched over several sessions--for\r\nhe was thrice re-elected, in 1836, 1838, and 1840--was not remarkably\r\nbrilliant. He did, indeed, not lack ambition. He dreamed even of making\r\nhimself \"the De Witt Clinton of Illinois,\" and he actually distinguished\r\nhimself by zealous and effective work in those \"log-rolling\" operations\r\nby which the young State received \"a general system of internal\r\nimprovements\" in the shape of railroads, canals, and banks,--a reckless\r\npolicy, burdening the State with debt, and producing the usual crop of\r\npolitical demoralization, but a policy characteristic of the time and\r\nthe impatiently enterprising spirit of the Western people. Lincoln,\r\nno doubt with the best intentions, but with little knowledge of the\r\nsubject, simply followed the popular current. The achievement in which,\r\nperhaps, he gloried most was the removal of the State government from\r\nVandalia to Springfield; one of those triumphs of political management\r\nwhich are apt to be the pride of the small politician's statesmanship.\r\nOne thing, however, he did in which his true nature asserted itself, and\r\nwhich gave distinct promise of the future pursuit of high aims. Against\r\nan overwhelming preponderance of sentiment in the Legislature, followed\r\nby only one other member, he recorded his protest against a proslavery\r\nresolution,--that protest declaring \"the institution of slavery to\r\nbe founded on both injustice and bad policy.\" This was not only the\r\nirrepressible voice of his conscience; it was true moral valor, too; for\r\nat that time, in many parts of the West, an abolitionist was regarded\r\nas little better than a horse-thief, and even \"Abe Lincoln\" would hardly\r\nhave been forgiven his antislavery principles, had he not been known\r\nas such an \"uncommon good fellow.\" But here, in obedience to the great\r\nconviction of his life, he manifested his courage to stand alone, that\r\ncourage which is the first requisite of leadership in a great cause.\r\n\r\nTogether with his reputation and influence as a politician grew his law\r\npractice, especially after he had removed from New Salem to Springfield,\r\nand associated himself with a practitioner of good standing. He had now\r\nat last won a fixed position in society. He became a successful lawyer,\r\nless, indeed, by his learning as a jurist than by his effectiveness as\r\nan advocate and by the striking uprightness of his character; and it may\r\ntruly be said that his vivid sense of truth and justice had much to do\r\nwith his effectiveness as an advocate. He would refuse to act as the\r\nattorney even of personal friends when he saw the right on the other\r\nside. He would abandon cases, even during trial, when the testimony\r\nconvinced him that his client was in the wrong. He would dissuade those\r\nwho sought his service from pursuing an obtainable advantage when their\r\nclaims seemed to him unfair. Presenting his very first case in the\r\nUnited States Circuit Court, the only question being one of authority,\r\nhe declared that, upon careful examination, he found all the authorities\r\non the other side, and none on his. Persons accused of crime, when he\r\nthought them guilty, he would not defend at all, or, attempting their\r\ndefence, he was unable to put forth his powers. One notable exception is\r\non record, when his personal sympathies had been strongly aroused. But\r\nwhen he felt himself to be the protector of innocence, the defender\r\nof justice, or the prosecutor of wrong, he frequently disclosed such\r\nunexpected resources of reasoning, such depth of feeling, and rose to\r\nsuch fervor of appeal as to astonish and overwhelm his hearers, and make\r\nhim fairly irresistible. Even an ordinary law argument, coming from him,\r\nseldom failed to produce the impression that he was profoundly convinced\r\nof the soundness of his position. It is not surprising that the mere\r\nappearance of so conscientious an attorney in any case should have\r\ncarried, not only to juries, but even to judges, almost a presumption\r\nof right on his side, and that the people began to call him, sincerely\r\nmeaning it, \"honest Abe Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he had private sorrows and trials of a painfully\r\nafflicting nature. He had loved and been loved by a fair and estimable\r\ngirl, Ann Rutledge, who died in the flower of her youth and beauty, and\r\nhe mourned her loss with such intensity of grief that his friends feared\r\nfor his reason. Recovering from his morbid depression, he bestowed\r\nwhat he thought a new affection upon another lady, who refused him.\r\nAnd finally, moderately prosperous in his worldly affairs, and having\r\nprospects of political distinction before him, he paid his addresses to\r\nMary Todd, of Kentucky, and was accepted. But then tormenting doubts of\r\nthe genuineness of his own affection for her, of the compatibility\r\nof their characters, and of their future happiness came upon him. His\r\ndistress was so great that he felt himself in danger of suicide, and\r\nfeared to carry a pocket-knife with him; and he gave mortal offence\r\nto his bride by not appearing on the appointed wedding day. Now the\r\ntorturing consciousness of the wrong he had done her grew unendurable.\r\nHe won back her affection, ended the agony by marrying her, and became a\r\nfaithful and patient husband and a good father. But it was no secret\r\nto those who knew the family well that his domestic life was full of\r\ntrials. The erratic temper of his wife not seldom put the gentleness\r\nof his nature to the severest tests; and these troubles and struggles,\r\nwhich accompanied him through all the vicissitudes of his life from\r\nthe modest home in Springfield to the White House at Washington,\r\nadding untold private heart-burnings to his public cares, and sometimes\r\nprecipitating upon him incredible embarrassments in the discharge of his\r\npublic duties, form one of the most pathetic features of his career.\r\n\r\nHe continued to \"ride the circuit,\" read books while travelling in his\r\nbuggy, told funny stories to his fellow-lawyers in the tavern, chatted\r\nfamiliarly with his neighbors around the stove in the store and at the\r\npost-office, had his hours of melancholy brooding as of old, and became\r\nmore and more widely known and trusted and beloved among the people\r\nof his State for his ability as a lawyer and politician, for the\r\nuprightness of his character and the overflowing spring of sympathetic\r\nkindness in his heart. His main ambition was confessedly that of\r\npolitical distinction; but hardly any one would at that time have seen\r\nin him the man destined to lead the nation through the greatest crisis\r\nof the century.\r\n\r\nHis time had not yet come when, in 1846, he was elected to Congress. In\r\na clever speech in the House of Representatives he denounced President\r\nPolk for having unjustly forced war upon Mexico, and he amused the\r\nCommittee of the Whole by a witty attack upon General Cass. More\r\nimportant was the expression he gave to his antislavery impulses\r\nby offering a bill looking to the emancipation of the slaves in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and by his repeated votes for the famous Wilmot\r\nProviso, intended to exclude slavery from the Territories acquired from\r\nMexico. But when, at the expiration of his term, in March, 1849, he left\r\nhis seat, he gloomily despaired of ever seeing the day when the cause\r\nnearest to his heart would be rightly grasped by the people, and when he\r\nwould be able to render any service to his country in solving the great\r\nproblem. Nor had his career as a member of Congress in any sense been\r\nsuch as to gratify his ambition. Indeed, if he ever had any belief in a\r\ngreat destiny for himself, it must have been weak at that period; for he\r\nactually sought to obtain from the new Whig President, General Taylor,\r\nthe place of Commissioner of the General Land Office; willing to\r\nbury himself in one of the administrative bureaus of the government.\r\nFortunately for the country, he failed; and no less fortunately, when,\r\nlater, the territorial governorship of Oregon was offered to him, Mrs.\r\nLincoln's protest induced him to decline it. Returning to Springfield,\r\nhe gave himself with renewed zest to his law practice, acquiesced in the\r\nCompromise of 1850 with reluctance and a mental reservation, supported\r\nin the Presidential campaign of 1852 the Whig candidate in some\r\nspiritless speeches, and took but a languid interest in the politics of\r\nthe day. But just then his time was drawing near.\r\n\r\nThe peace promised, and apparently inaugurated, by the Compromise of\r\n1850 was rudely broken by the introduction of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill\r\nin 1854. The repeal of the Missouri Compromise, opening the Territories\r\nof the United States, the heritage of coming generations, to the\r\ninvasion of slavery, suddenly revealed the whole significance of the\r\nslavery question to the people of the free States, and thrust itself\r\ninto the politics of the country as the paramount issue. Something like\r\nan electric shock flashed through the North. Men who but a short time\r\nbefore had been absorbed by their business pursuits, and deprecated all\r\npolitical agitation, were startled out of their security by a sudden\r\nalarm, and excitedly took sides. That restless trouble of conscience\r\nabout slavery, which even in times of apparent repose had secretly\r\ndisturbed the souls of Northern people, broke forth in an utterance\r\nlouder than ever. The bonds of accustomed party allegiance gave way.\r\nAntislavery Democrats and antislavery Whigs felt themselves drawn\r\ntogether by a common overpowering sentiment, and soon they began to\r\nrally in a new organization. The Republican party sprang into being to\r\nmeet the overruling call of the hour. Then Abraham Lincoln's time was\r\ncome. He rapidly advanced to a position of conspicuous championship in\r\nthe struggle. This, however, was not owing to his virtues and abilities\r\nalone. Indeed, the slavery question stirred his soul in its profoundest\r\ndepths; it was, as one of his intimate friends said, \"the only one on\r\nwhich he would become excited\"; it called forth all his faculties and\r\nenergies. Yet there were many others who, having long and arduously\r\nfought the antislavery battle in the popular assembly, or in the press,\r\nor in the halls of Congress, far surpassed him in prestige, and compared\r\nwith whom he was still an obscure and untried man. His reputation,\r\nalthough highly honorable and well earned, had so far been essentially\r\nlocal. As a stump-speaker in Whig canvasses outside of his State he had\r\nattracted comparatively little attention; but in Illinois he had been\r\nrecognized as one of the foremost men of the Whig party. Among the\r\nopponents of the Nebraska Bill he occupied in his State so important\r\na position, that in 1856 he was the choice of a large majority of the\r\n\"Anti-Nebraska men\" in the Legislature for a seat in the Senate of the\r\nUnited States which then became vacant; and when he, an old Whig, could\r\nnot obtain the votes of the Anti-Nebraska Democrats necessary to make\r\na majority, he generously urged his friends to transfer their votes\r\nto Lyman Trumbull, who was then elected. Two years later, in the\r\nfirst national convention of the Republican party, the delegation from\r\nIllinois brought him forward as a candidate for the vice-presidency, and\r\nhe received respectable support. Still, the name of Abraham Lincoln was\r\nnot widely known beyond the boundaries of his own State. But now it was\r\nthis local prominence in Illinois that put him in a position of peculiar\r\nadvantage on the battlefield of national politics. In the assault on the\r\nMissouri Compromise which broke down all legal barriers to the spread\r\nof slavery Stephen Arnold Douglas was the ostensible leader and central\r\nfigure; and Douglas was a Senator from Illinois, Lincoln's State.\r\nDouglas's national theatre of action was the Senate, but in his\r\nconstituency in Illinois were the roots of his official position and\r\npower. What he did in the Senate he had to justify before the people\r\nof Illinois, in order to maintain himself in place; and in Illinois all\r\neyes turned to Lincoln as Douglas's natural antagonist.\r\n\r\nAs very young men they had come to Illinois, Lincoln from Indiana,\r\nDouglas from Vermont, and had grown up together in public life, Douglas\r\nas a Democrat, Lincoln as a Whig. They had met first in Vandalia, in\r\n1834, when Lincoln was in the Legislature and Douglas in the lobby; and\r\nagain in 1836, both as members of the Legislature. Douglas, a very able\r\npolitician, of the agile, combative, audacious, \"pushing\" sort, rose in\r\npolitical distinction with remarkable rapidity. In quick succession he\r\nbecame a member of the Legislature, a State's attorney, secretary\r\nof state, a judge on the supreme bench of Illinois, three times a\r\nRepresentative in Congress, and a Senator of the United States when only\r\nthirty-nine years old. In the National Democratic convention of 1852 he\r\nappeared even as an aspirant to the nomination for the Presidency, as\r\nthe favorite of \"young America,\" and received a respectable vote. He had\r\nfar outstripped Lincoln in what is commonly called political success\r\nand in reputation. But it had frequently happened that in political\r\ncampaigns Lincoln felt himself impelled, or was selected by his Whig\r\nfriends, to answer Douglas's speeches; and thus the two were looked\r\nupon, in a large part of the State at least, as the representative\r\ncombatants of their respective parties in the debates before\r\npopular meetings. As soon, therefore, as, after the passage of his\r\nKansas-Nebraska Bill, Douglas returned to Illinois to defend his cause\r\nbefore his constituents, Lincoln, obeying not only his own impulse, but\r\nalso general expectation, stepped forward as his principal opponent.\r\nThus the struggle about the principles involved in the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nBill, or, in a broader sense, the struggle between freedom and slavery,\r\nassumed in Illinois the outward form of a personal contest between\r\nLincoln and Douglas; and, as it continued and became more animated,\r\nthat personal contest in Illinois was watched with constantly increasing\r\ninterest by the whole country. When, in 1858, Douglas's senatorial term\r\nbeing about to expire, Lincoln was formally designated by the Republican\r\nconvention of Illinois as their candidate for the Senate, to take\r\nDouglas's place, and the two contestants agreed to debate the questions\r\nat issue face to face in a series of public meetings, the eyes of the\r\nwhole American people were turned eagerly to that one point: and the\r\nspectacle reminded one of those lays of ancient times telling of two\r\narmies, in battle array, standing still to see their two principal\r\nchampions fight out the contested cause between the lines in single\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nLincoln had then reached the full maturity of his powers. His equipment\r\nas a statesman did not embrace a comprehensive knowledge of public\r\naffairs. What he had studied he had indeed made his own, with the eager\r\ncraving and that zealous tenacity characteristic of superior minds\r\nlearning under difficulties. But his narrow opportunities and the\r\nunsteady life he had led during his younger years had not permitted\r\nthe accumulation of large stores in his mind. It is true, in political\r\ncampaigns he had occasionally spoken on the ostensible issues between\r\nthe Whigs and the Democrats, the tariff, internal improvements, banks,\r\nand so on, but only in a perfunctory manner. Had he ever given much\r\nserious thought and study to these subjects, it is safe to assume that\r\na mind so prolific of original conceits as his would certainly have\r\nproduced some utterance upon them worth remembering. His soul had\r\nevidently never been deeply stirred by such topics. But when his moral\r\nnature was aroused, his brain developed an untiring activity until it\r\nhad mastered all the knowledge within reach. As soon as the repeal of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise had thrust the slavery question into politics\r\nas the paramount issue, Lincoln plunged into an arduous study of all\r\nits legal, historical, and moral aspects, and then his mind became a\r\ncomplete arsenal of argument. His rich natural gifts, trained by long\r\nand varied practice, had made him an orator of rare persuasiveness. In\r\nhis immature days, he had pleased himself for a short period with that\r\ninflated, high-flown style which, among the uncultivated, passes for\r\n\"beautiful speaking.\" His inborn truthfulness and his artistic instinct\r\nsoon overcame that aberration and revealed to him the noble beauty and\r\nstrength of simplicity. He possessed an uncommon power of clear and\r\ncompact statement, which might have reminded those who knew the story\r\nof his early youth of the efforts of the poor boy, when he copied his\r\ncompositions from the scraped wooden shovel, carefully to trim his\r\nexpressions in order to save paper. His language had the energy of\r\nhonest directness and he was a master of logical lucidity. He loved\r\nto point and enliven his reasoning by humorous illustrations, usually\r\nanecdotes of Western life, of which he had an inexhaustible store at his\r\ncommand. These anecdotes had not seldom a flavor of rustic robustness\r\nabout them, but he used them with great effect, while amusing the\r\naudience, to give life to an abstraction, to explode an absurdity, to\r\nclinch an argument, to drive home an admonition. The natural kindliness\r\nof his tone, softening prejudice and disarming partisan rancor, would\r\noften open to his reasoning a way into minds most unwilling to receive\r\nit.\r\n\r\nYet his greatest power consisted in the charm of his individuality. That\r\ncharm did not, in the ordinary way, appeal to the ear or to the eye. His\r\nvoice was not melodious; rather shrill and piercing, especially when it\r\nrose to its high treble in moments of great animation. His figure was\r\nunhandsome, and the action of his unwieldy limbs awkward. He commanded\r\nnone of the outward graces of oratory as they are commonly understood.\r\nHis charm was of a different kind. It flowed from the rare depth and\r\ngenuineness of his convictions and his sympathetic feelings. Sympathy\r\nwas the strongest element in his nature. One of his biographers, who\r\nknew him before he became President, says: \"Lincoln's compassion might\r\nbe stirred deeply by an object present, but never by an object absent\r\nand unseen. In the former case he would most likely extend relief, with\r\nlittle inquiry into the merits of the case, because, as he expressed it\r\nhimself, it `took a pain out of his own heart.'\" Only half of this is\r\ncorrect. It is certainly true that he could not witness any individual\r\ndistress or oppression, or any kind of suffering, without feeling a pang\r\nof pain himself, and that by relieving as much as he could the suffering\r\nof others he put an end to his own. This compassionate impulse to help\r\nhe felt not only for human beings, but for every living creature. As in\r\nhis boyhood he angrily reproved the boys who tormented a wood turtle by\r\nputting a burning coal on its back, so, we are told, he would, when a\r\nmature man, on a journey, dismount from his buggy and wade waist-deep\r\nin mire to rescue a pig struggling in a swamp. Indeed, appeals to his\r\ncompassion were so irresistible to him, and he felt it so difficult\r\nto refuse anything when his refusal could give pain, that he himself\r\nsometimes spoke of his inability to say \"no\" as a positive weakness.\r\nBut that certainly does not prove that his compassionate feeling was\r\nconfined to individual cases of suffering witnessed with his own eyes.\r\nAs the boy was moved by the aspect of the tortured wood turtle to\r\ncompose an essay against cruelty to animals in general, so the aspect of\r\nother cases of suffering and wrong wrought up his moral nature, and set\r\nhis mind to work against cruelty, injustice, and oppression in general.\r\n\r\nAs his sympathy went forth to others, it attracted others to him.\r\nEspecially those whom he called the \"plain people\" felt themselves drawn\r\nto him by the instinctive feeling that he understood, esteemed, and\r\nappreciated them. He had grown up among the poor, the lowly, the\r\nignorant. He never ceased to remember the good souls he had met among\r\nthem, and the many kindnesses they had done him. Although in his mental\r\ndevelopment he had risen far above them, he never looked down upon them.\r\nHow they felt and how they reasoned he knew, for so he had once felt and\r\nreasoned himself. How they could be moved he knew, for so he had once\r\nbeen moved himself and practised moving others. His mind was much larger\r\nthan theirs, but it thoroughly comprehended theirs; and while he thought\r\nmuch farther than they, their thoughts were ever present to him. Nor had\r\nthe visible distance between them grown as wide as his rise in the world\r\nwould seem to have warranted. Much of his backwoods speech and manners\r\nstill clung to him. Although he had become \"Mr. Lincoln\" to his later\r\nacquaintances, he was still \"Abe\" to the \"Nats\" and \"Billys\" and \"Daves\"\r\nof his youth; and their familiarity neither appeared unnatural to\r\nthem, nor was it in the least awkward to him. He still told and\r\nenjoyed stories similar to those he had told and enjoyed in the Indiana\r\nsettlement and at New Salem. His wants remained as modest as they had\r\never been; his domestic habits had by no means completely accommodated\r\nthemselves to those of his more highborn wife; and though the \"Kentucky\r\njeans\" apparel had long been dropped, his clothes of better material\r\nand better make would sit ill sorted on his gigantic limbs. His cotton\r\numbrella, without a handle, and tied together with a coarse string to\r\nkeep it from flapping, which he carried on his circuit rides, is said to\r\nbe remembered still by some of his surviving neighbors. This rusticity\r\nof habit was utterly free from that affected contempt of refinement and\r\ncomfort which self-made men sometimes carry into their more affluent\r\ncircumstances. To Abraham Lincoln it was entirely natural, and all those\r\nwho came into contact with him knew it to be so. In his ways of thinking\r\nand feeling he had become a gentleman in the highest sense, but the\r\nrefining process had polished but little the outward form. The plain\r\npeople, therefore, still considered \"honest Abe Lincoln\" one of\r\nthemselves; and when they felt, which they no doubt frequently did, that\r\nhis thoughts and aspirations moved in a sphere above their own,\r\nthey were all the more proud of him, without any diminution\r\nof fellow-feeling. It was this relation of mutual sympathy and\r\nunderstanding between Lincoln and the plain people that gave him his\r\npeculiar power as a public man, and singularly fitted him, as we shall\r\nsee, for that leadership which was preeminently required in the great\r\ncrisis then coming on,--the leadership which indeed thinks and moves\r\nahead of the masses, but always remains within sight and sympathetic\r\ntouch of them.\r\n\r\nHe entered upon the campaign of 1858 better equipped than he had ever\r\nbeen before. He not only instinctively felt, but he had convinced\r\nhimself by arduous study, that in this struggle against the spread of\r\nslavery he had right, justice, philosophy, the enlightened opinion of\r\nmankind, history, the Constitution, and good policy on his side. It\r\nwas observed that after he began to discuss the slavery question his\r\nspeeches were pitched in a much loftier key than his former oratorical\r\nefforts. While he remained fond of telling funny stories in private\r\nconversation, they disappeared more and more from his public discourse.\r\nHe would still now and then point his argument with expressions of\r\ninimitable quaintness, and flash out rays of kindly humor and witty\r\nirony; but his general tone was serious, and rose sometimes to genuine\r\nsolemnity. His masterly skill in dialectical thrust and parry, his\r\nwealth of knowledge, his power of reasoning and elevation of sentiment,\r\ndisclosed in language of rare precision, strength, and beauty, not\r\nseldom astonished his old friends.\r\n\r\nNeither of the two champions could have found a more formidable\r\nantagonist than each now met in the other. Douglas was by far the most\r\nconspicuous member of his party. His admirers had dubbed him \"the Little\r\nGiant,\" contrasting in that nickname the greatness of his mind with the\r\nsmallness of his body. But though of low stature, his broad-shouldered\r\nfigure appeared uncommonly sturdy, and there was something lion-like in\r\nthe squareness of his brow and jaw, and in the defiant shake of his long\r\nhair. His loud and persistent advocacy of territorial expansion, in the\r\nname of patriotism and \"manifest destiny,\" had given him an enthusiastic\r\nfollowing among the young and ardent. Great natural parts, a highly\r\ncombative temperament, and long training had made him a debater\r\nunsurpassed in a Senate filled with able men. He could be as forceful in\r\nhis appeals to patriotic feelings as he was fierce in denunciation and\r\nthoroughly skilled in all the baser tricks of parliamentary pugilism.\r\nWhile genial and rollicking in his social intercourse--the idol of the\r\n\"boys\" he felt himself one of the most renowned statesmen of his time,\r\nand would frequently meet his opponents with an overbearing haughtiness,\r\nas persons more to be pitied than to be feared. In his speech opening\r\nthe campaign of 1858, he spoke of Lincoln, whom the Republicans had\r\ndared to advance as their candidate for \"his\" place in the Senate, with\r\nan air of patronizing if not contemptuous condescension, as \"a kind,\r\namiable, and intelligent gentleman and a good citizen.\" The Little Giant\r\nwould have been pleased to pass off his antagonist as a tall dwarf. He\r\nknew Lincoln too well, however, to indulge himself seriously in such a\r\ndelusion. But the political situation was at that moment in a curious\r\ntangle, and Douglas could expect to derive from the confusion great\r\nadvantage over his opponent.\r\n\r\nBy the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, opening the Territories to the\r\ningress of slavery, Douglas had pleased the South, but greatly alarmed\r\nthe North. He had sought to conciliate Northern sentiment by appending\r\nto his Kansas-Nebraska Bill the declaration that its intent was \"not\r\nto legislate slavery into any State or Territory, nor to exclude it\r\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form\r\nand regulate their institutions in their own way, subject only to the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\" This he called \"the great principle\r\nof popular sovereignty.\" When asked whether, under this act, the people\r\nof a Territory, before its admission as a State, would have the right\r\nto exclude slavery, he answered, \"That is a question for the courts\r\nto decide.\" Then came the famous \"Dred Scott decision,\" in which the\r\nSupreme Court held substantially that the right to hold slaves\r\nas property existed in the Territories by virtue of the Federal\r\nConstitution, and that this right could not be denied by any act of a\r\nterritorial government. This, of course, denied the right of the people\r\nof any Territory to exclude slavery while they were in a territorial\r\ncondition, and it alarmed the Northern people still more. Douglas\r\nrecognized the binding force of the decision of the Supreme Court, at\r\nthe same time maintaining, most illogically, that his great principle\r\nof popular sovereignty remained in force nevertheless. Meanwhile, the\r\nproslavery people of western Missouri, the so-called \"border ruffians,\"\r\nhad invaded Kansas, set up a constitutional convention, made\r\na constitution of an extreme pro-slavery type, the \"Lecompton\r\nConstitution,\" refused to submit it fairly to a vote of the people of\r\nKansas, and then referred it to Congress for acceptance,--seeking thus\r\nto accomplish the admission of Kansas as a slave State. Had Douglas\r\nsupported such a scheme, he would have lost all foothold in the North.\r\nIn the name of popular sovereignty he loudly declared his opposition to\r\nthe acceptance of any constitution not sanctioned by a formal popular\r\nvote. He \"did not care,\" he said, \"whether slavery be voted up or down,\"\r\nbut there must be a fair vote of the people. Thus he drew upon himself\r\nthe hostility of the Buchanan administration, which was controlled by\r\nthe proslavery interest, but he saved his Northern following. More\r\nthan this, not only did his Democratic admirers now call him \"the true\r\nchampion of freedom,\" but even some Republicans of large influence,\r\nprominent among them Horace Greeley, sympathizing with Douglas in his\r\nfight against the Lecompton Constitution, and hoping to detach him\r\npermanently from the proslavery interest and to force a lasting breach\r\nin the Democratic party, seriously advised the Republicans of Illinois\r\nto give up their opposition to Douglas, and to help re-elect him to the\r\nSenate. Lincoln was not of that opinion. He believed that great popular\r\nmovements can succeed only when guided by their faithful friends, and\r\nthat the antislavery cause could not safely be entrusted to the keeping\r\nof one who \"did not care whether slavery be voted up or down.\" This\r\nopinion prevailed in Illinois; but the influences within the Republican\r\nparty over which it prevailed yielded only a reluctant acquiescence, if\r\nthey acquiesced at all, after having materially strengthened Douglas's\r\nposition. Such was the situation of things when the campaign of 1858\r\nbetween Lincoln and Douglas began.\r\n\r\nLincoln opened the campaign on his side at the convention which\r\nnominated him as the Republican candidate for the senatorship, with\r\na memorable saying which sounded like a shout from the watchtower of\r\nhistory: \"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this\r\ngovernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not\r\nexpect the Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall, but\r\nI expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or\r\nall the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further\r\nspread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the\r\nbelief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates\r\nwill push it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in all the\r\nStates,--old as well as new, North as well as South.\" Then he proceeded\r\nto point out that the Nebraska doctrine combined with the Dred Scott\r\ndecision worked in the direction of making the nation \"all slave.\" Here\r\nwas the \"irrepressible conflict\" spoken of by Seward a short time later,\r\nin a speech made famous mainly by that phrase. If there was any new\r\ndiscovery in it, the right of priority was Lincoln's. This utterance\r\nproved not only his statesmanlike conception of the issue, but also,\r\nin his situation as a candidate, the firmness of his moral courage.\r\nThe friends to whom he had read the draught of this speech before he\r\ndelivered it warned him anxiously that its delivery might be fatal to\r\nhis success in the election. This was shrewd advice, in the ordinary\r\nsense. While a slaveholder could threaten disunion with impunity, the\r\nmere suggestion that the existence of slavery was incompatible with\r\nfreedom in the Union would hazard the political chances of any public\r\nman in the North. But Lincoln was inflexible. \"It is true,\" said he,\r\n\"and I will deliver it as written.... I would rather be defeated with\r\nthese expressions in my speech held up and discussed before the people\r\nthan be victorious without them.\" The statesman was right in his\r\nfar-seeing judgment and his conscientious statement of the truth, but\r\nthe practical politicians were also right in their prediction of the\r\nimmediate effect. Douglas instantly seized upon the declaration that a\r\nhouse divided against itself cannot stand as the main objective point of\r\nhis attack, interpreting it as an incitement to a \"relentless sectional\r\nwar,\" and there is no doubt that the persistent reiteration of this\r\ncharge served to frighten not a few timid souls.\r\n\r\nLincoln constantly endeavored to bring the moral and philosophical side\r\nof the subject to the foreground. \"Slavery is wrong\" was the keynote of\r\nall his speeches. To Douglas's glittering sophism that the right of the\r\npeople of a Territory to have slavery or not, as they might desire, was\r\nin accordance with the principle of true popular sovereignty, he made\r\nthe pointed answer: \"Then true popular sovereignty, according to Senator\r\nDouglas, means that, when one man makes another man his slave, no\r\nthird man shall be allowed to object.\" To Douglas's argument that\r\nthe principle which demanded that the people of a Territory should be\r\npermitted to choose whether they would have slavery or not \"originated\r\nwhen God made man, and placed good and evil before him, allowing him\r\nto choose upon his own responsibility,\" Lincoln solemnly replied: \"No;\r\nGod--did not place good and evil before man, telling him to make his\r\nchoice. On the contrary, God did tell him there was one tree of the\r\nfruit of which he should not eat, upon pain of death.\" He did not,\r\nhowever, place himself on the most advanced ground taken by the radical\r\nanti-slavery men. He admitted that, under the Constitution, \"the\r\nSouthern people were entitled to a Congressional fugitive slave law,\"\r\nalthough he did not approve the fugitive slave law then existing. He\r\ndeclared also that, if slavery were kept out of the Territories during\r\ntheir territorial existence, as it should be, and if then the people of\r\nany Territory, having a fair chance and a clear field, should do such\r\nan extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave constitution, uninfluenced by\r\nthe actual presence of the institution among them, he saw no alternative\r\nbut to admit such a Territory into the Union. He declared further that,\r\nwhile he should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, he would, as a member of Congress, with his\r\npresent views, not endeavor to bring on that abolition except on\r\ncondition that emancipation be gradual, that it be approved by the\r\ndecision of a majority of voters in the District, and that compensation\r\nbe made to unwilling owners. On every available occasion, he pronounced\r\nhimself in favor of the deportation and colonization of the blacks, of\r\ncourse with their consent. He repeatedly disavowed any wish on his part\r\nto have social and political equality established between whites and\r\nblacks. On this point he summed up his views in a reply to Douglas's\r\nassertion that the Declaration of Independence, in speaking of all men\r\nas being created equal, did not include the negroes, saying: \"I do not\r\nunderstand the Declaration of Independence to mean that all men were\r\ncreated equal in all respects. They are not equal in color. But I\r\nbelieve that it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some\r\nrespects; they are equal in their right to life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to some of these subjects Lincoln modified his position at\r\na later period, and it has been suggested that he would have professed\r\nmore advanced principles in his debates with Douglas, had he not feared\r\nthereby to lose votes. This view can hardly be sustained. Lincoln had\r\nthe courage of his opinions, but he was not a radical. The man who\r\nrisked his election by delivering, against the urgent protest of his\r\nfriends, the speech about \"the house divided against itself\" would not\r\nhave shrunk from the expression of more extreme views, had he really\r\nentertained them. It is only fair to assume that he said what at the\r\ntime he really thought, and that if, subsequently, his opinions changed,\r\nit was owing to new conceptions of good policy and of duty brought\r\nforth by an entirely new set of circumstances and exigencies. It\r\nis characteristic that he continued to adhere to the impracticable\r\ncolonization plan even after the Emancipation Proclamation had already\r\nbeen issued.\r\n\r\nBut in this contest Lincoln proved himself not only a debater, but\r\nalso a political strategist of the first order. The \"kind, amiable, and\r\nintelligent gentleman,\" as Douglas had been pleased to call him, was by\r\nno means as harmless as a dove. He possessed an uncommon share of that\r\nworldly shrewdness which not seldom goes with genuine simplicity of\r\ncharacter; and the political experience gathered in the Legislature\r\nand in Congress, and in many election campaigns, added to his keen\r\nintuitions, had made him as far-sighted a judge of the probable effects\r\nof a public man's sayings or doings upon the popular mind, and as\r\naccurate a calculator in estimating political chances and forecasting\r\nresults, as could be found among the party managers in Illinois. And\r\nnow he perceived keenly the ugly dilemma in which Douglas found himself,\r\nbetween the Dred Scott decision, which declared the right to hold slaves\r\nto exist in the Territories by virtue of the Federal Constitution, and\r\nhis \"great principle of popular sovereignty,\" according to which the\r\npeople of a Territory, if they saw fit, were to have the right to\r\nexclude slavery therefrom. Douglas was twisting and squirming to\r\nthe best of his ability to avoid the admission that the two were\r\nincompatible. The question then presented itself if it would be good\r\npolicy for Lincoln to force Douglas to a clear expression of his opinion\r\nas to whether, the Dred Scott decision notwithstanding, \"the people of a\r\nTerritory could in any lawful way exclude slavery from its limits prior\r\nto the formation of a State constitution.\" Lincoln foresaw and predicted\r\nwhat Douglas would answer: that slavery could not exist in a Territory\r\nunless the people desired it and gave it protection by territorial\r\nlegislation. In an improvised caucus the policy of pressing the\r\ninterrogatory on Douglas was discussed. Lincoln's friends unanimously\r\nadvised against it, because the answer foreseen would sufficiently\r\ncommend Douglas to the people of Illinois to insure his re-election to\r\nthe Senate. But Lincoln persisted. \"I am after larger game,\" said he.\r\n\"If Douglas so answers, he can never be President, and the battle of\r\n1860 is worth a hundred of this.\" The interrogatory was pressed upon\r\nDouglas, and Douglas did answer that, no matter what the decision of\r\nthe Supreme Court might be on the abstract question, the people of\r\na Territory had the lawful means to introduce or exclude slavery by\r\nterritorial legislation friendly or unfriendly to the institution.\r\nLincoln found it easy to show the absurdity of the proposition that, if\r\nslavery were admitted to exist of right in the Territories by virtue\r\nof the supreme law, the Federal Constitution, it could be kept out or\r\nexpelled by an inferior law, one made by a territorial Legislature.\r\nAgain the judgment of the politicians, having only the nearest object in\r\nview, proved correct: Douglas was reelected to the Senate. But Lincoln's\r\njudgment proved correct also: Douglas, by resorting to the expedient\r\nof his \"unfriendly legislation doctrine,\" forfeited his last chance of\r\nbecoming President of the United States. He might have hoped to win, by\r\nsufficient atonement, his pardon from the South for his opposition\r\nto the Lecompton Constitution; but that he taught the people of the\r\nTerritories a trick by which they could defeat what the proslavery men\r\nconsidered a constitutional right, and that he called that trick\r\nlawful, this the slave power would never forgive. The breach between\r\nthe Southern and the Northern Democracy was thenceforth irremediable and\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential election of 1860 approached. The struggle in Kansas,\r\nand the debates in Congress which accompanied it, and which not\r\nunfrequently provoked violent outbursts, continually stirred the popular\r\nexcitement. Within the Democratic party raged the war of factions. The\r\nnational Democratic convention met at Charleston on the 23d of April,\r\n1860. After a struggle of ten days between the adherents and the\r\nopponents of Douglas, during which the delegates from the cotton States\r\nhad withdrawn, the convention adjourned without having nominated any\r\ncandidates, to meet again in Baltimore on the 18th of June. There was no\r\nprospect, however, of reconciling the hostile elements. It appeared very\r\nprobable that the Baltimore convention would nominate Douglas, while\r\nthe seceding Southern Democrats would set up a candidate of their own,\r\nrepresenting extreme proslavery principles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the national Republican convention assembled at Chicago on\r\nthe 16th of May, full of enthusiasm and hope. The situation was easily\r\nunderstood. The Democrats would have the South. In order to succeed\r\nin the election, the Republicans had to win, in addition to the States\r\ncarried by Fremont in 1856, those that were classed as \"doubtful,\"--New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, or Illinois in the place of either\r\nNew Jersey or Indiana. The most eminent Republican statesmen and leaders\r\nof the time thought of for the Presidency were Seward and Chase, both\r\nregarded as belonging to the more advanced order of antislavery men.\r\nOf the two, Seward had the largest following, mainly from New York,\r\nNew England, and the Northwest. Cautious politicians doubted seriously\r\nwhether Seward, to whom some phrases in his speeches had undeservedly\r\ngiven the reputation of a reckless radical, would be able to command the\r\nwhole Republican vote in the doubtful States. Besides, during his long\r\npublic career he had made enemies. It was evident that those who thought\r\nSeward's nomination too hazardous an experiment would consider Chase\r\nunavailable for the same reason. They would then look round for an\r\n\"available\" man; and among the \"available\" men Abraham Lincoln was\r\neasily discovered to stand foremost. His great debate with Douglas had\r\ngiven him a national reputation. The people of the East being eager\r\nto see the hero of so dramatic a contest, he had been induced to visit\r\nseveral Eastern cities, and had astonished and delighted large and\r\ndistinguished audiences with speeches of singular power and originality.\r\nAn address delivered by him in the Cooper Institute in New York, before\r\nan audience containing a large number of important persons, was then,\r\nand has ever since been, especially praised as one of the most logical\r\nand convincing political speeches ever made in this country. The people\r\nof the West had grown proud of him as a distinctively Western great man,\r\nand his popularity at home had some peculiar features which could be\r\nexpected to exercise a potent charm. Nor was Lincoln's name as that of\r\nan available candidate left to the chance of accidental discovery. It\r\nis indeed not probable that he thought of himself as a Presidential\r\npossibility, during his contest with Douglas for the senatorship. As\r\nlate as April, 1859, he had written to a friend who had approached him\r\non the subject that he did not think himself fit for the Presidency.\r\nThe Vice-Presidency was then the limit of his ambition. But some of\r\nhis friends in Illinois took the matter seriously in hand, and Lincoln,\r\nafter some hesitation, then formally authorized \"the use of his name.\"\r\nThe matter was managed with such energy and excellent judgment that,\r\nin the convention, he had not only the whole vote of Illinois to start\r\nwith, but won votes on all sides without offending any rival. A large\r\nmajority of the opponents of Seward went over to Abraham Lincoln, and\r\ngave him the nomination on the third ballot. As had been foreseen,\r\nDouglas was nominated by one wing of the Democratic party at Baltimore,\r\nwhile the extreme proslavery wing put Breckinridge into the field as\r\nits candidate. After a campaign conducted with the energy of genuine\r\nenthusiasm on the antislavery side the united Republicans defeated the\r\ndivided Democrats, and Lincoln was elected President by a majority of\r\nfifty-seven votes in the electoral colleges.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election had hardly been declared when the disunion\r\nmovement in the South, long threatened and carefully planned and\r\nprepared, broke out in the shape of open revolt, and nearly a month\r\nbefore Lincoln could be inaugurated as President of the United States\r\nseven Southern States had adopted ordinances of secession, formed an\r\nindependent confederacy, framed a constitution for it, and elected\r\nJefferson Davis its president, expecting the other slaveholding\r\nStates soon to join them. On the 11th of February, 1861, Lincoln left\r\nSpringfield for Washington; having, with characteristic simplicity,\r\nasked his law partner not to change the sign of the firm \"Lincoln\r\nand Herndon\" during the four years unavoidable absence of the senior\r\npartner, and having taken an affectionate and touching leave of his\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nThe situation which confronted the new President was appalling: the\r\nlarger part of the South in open rebellion, the rest of the slaveholding\r\nStates wavering preparing to follow; the revolt guided by determined,\r\ndaring, and skillful leaders; the Southern people, apparently full of\r\nenthusiasm and military spirit, rushing to arms, some of the forts\r\nand arsenals already in their possession; the government of the Union,\r\nbefore the accession of the new President, in the hands of men some of\r\nwhom actively sympathized with the revolt, while others were hampered by\r\ntheir traditional doctrines in dealing with it, and really gave it aid\r\nand comfort by their irresolute attitude; all the departments full of\r\n\"Southern sympathizers\" and honeycombed with disloyalty; the treasury\r\nempty, and the public credit at the lowest ebb; the arsenals ill\r\nsupplied with arms, if not emptied by treacherous practices; the regular\r\narmy of insignificant strength, dispersed over an immense surface, and\r\ndeprived of some of its best officers by defection; the navy small and\r\nantiquated. But that was not all. The threat of disunion had so often\r\nbeen resorted to by the slave power in years gone by that most Northern\r\npeople had ceased to believe in its seriousness. But, when disunion\r\nactually appeared as a stern reality, something like a chill swept\r\nthrough the whole Northern country. A cry for union and peace at any\r\nprice rose on all sides. Democratic partisanship reiterated this cry\r\nwith vociferous vehemence, and even many Republicans grew afraid of\r\nthe victory they had just achieved at the ballot-box, and spoke of\r\ncompromise. The country fairly resounded with the noise of \"anticoercion\r\nmeetings.\" Expressions of firm resolution from determined antislavery\r\nmen were indeed not wanting, but they were for a while almost drowned\r\nby a bewildering confusion of discordant voices. Even this was not\r\nall. Potent influences in Europe, with an ill-concealed desire for the\r\npermanent disruption of the American Union, eagerly espoused the cause\r\nof the Southern seceders, and the two principal maritime powers of the\r\nOld World seemed only to be waiting for a favorable opportunity to lend\r\nthem a helping hand.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things to be mastered by \"honest Abe Lincoln\" when\r\nhe took his seat in the Presidential chair,--\"honest Abe Lincoln,\" who\r\nwas so good-natured that he could not say \"no\"; the greatest achievement\r\nin whose life had been a debate on the slavery question; who had never\r\nbeen in any position of power; who was without the slightest experience\r\nof high executive duties, and who had only a speaking acquaintance with\r\nthe men upon whose counsel and cooperation he was to depend. Nor was\r\nhis accession to power under such circumstances greeted with general\r\nconfidence even by the members of his party. While he had indeed won\r\nmuch popularity, many Republicans, especially among those who had\r\nadvocated Seward's nomination for the Presidency, saw the simple\r\n\"Illinois lawyer\" take the reins of government with a feeling little\r\nshort of dismay. The orators and journals of the opposition were\r\nridiculing and lampooning him without measure. Many people actually\r\nwondered how such a man could dare to undertake a task which, as he\r\nhimself had said to his neighbors in his parting speech, was \"more\r\ndifficult than that of Washington himself had been.\"\r\n\r\nBut Lincoln brought to that task, aside from other uncommon qualities,\r\nthe first requisite,--an intuitive comprehension of its nature. While\r\nhe did not indulge in the delusion that the Union could be maintained or\r\nrestored without a conflict of arms, he could indeed not foresee all the\r\nproblems he would have to solve. He instinctively understood, however,\r\nby what means that conflict would have to be conducted by the government\r\nof a democracy. He knew that the impending war, whether great or small,\r\nwould not be like a foreign war, exciting a united national enthusiasm,\r\nbut a civil war, likely to fan to uncommon heat the animosities of party\r\neven in the localities controlled by the government; that this war would\r\nhave to be carried on not by means of a ready-made machinery, ruled\r\nby an undisputed, absolute will, but by means to be furnished by the\r\nvoluntary action of the people:--armies to be formed by voluntary\r\nenlistments; large sums of money to be raised by the people, through\r\nrepresentatives, voluntarily taxing themselves; trust of extraordinary\r\npower to be voluntarily granted; and war measures, not seldom\r\nrestricting the rights and liberties to which the citizen was\r\naccustomed, to be voluntarily accepted and submitted to by the people,\r\nor at least a large majority of them; and that this would have to be\r\nkept up not merely during a short period of enthusiastic excitement; but\r\npossibly through weary years of alternating success and disaster, hope\r\nand despondency. He knew that in order to steer this government by\r\npublic opinion successfully through all the confusion created by the\r\nprejudices and doubts and differences of sentiment distracting the\r\npopular mind, and so to propitiate, inspire, mould, organize, unite, and\r\nguide the popular will that it might give forth all the means required\r\nfor the performance of his great task, he would have to take into\r\naccount all the influences strongly affecting the current of popular\r\nthought and feeling, and to direct while appearing to obey.\r\n\r\nThis was the kind of leadership he intuitively conceived to be needed\r\nwhen a free people were to be led forward en masse to overcome a\r\ngreat common danger under circumstances of appalling difficulty, the\r\nleadership which does not dash ahead with brilliant daring, no matter\r\nwho follows, but which is intent upon rallying all the available forces,\r\ngathering in the stragglers, closing up the column, so that the front\r\nmay advance well supported. For this leadership Abraham Lincoln was\r\nadmirably fitted, better than any other American statesman of his day;\r\nfor he understood the plain people, with all their loves and hates,\r\ntheir prejudices and their noble impulses, their weaknesses and their\r\nstrength, as he understood himself, and his sympathetic nature was apt\r\nto draw their sympathy to him.\r\n\r\nHis inaugural address foreshadowed his official course in characteristic\r\nmanner. Although yielding nothing in point of principle, it was by no\r\nmeans a flaming antislavery manifesto, such as would have pleased the\r\nmore ardent Republicans. It was rather the entreaty of a sorrowing\r\nfather speaking to his wayward children. In the kindliest language\r\nhe pointed out to the secessionists how ill advised their attempt at\r\ndisunion was, and why, for their own sakes, they should desist. Almost\r\nplaintively, he told them that, while it was not their duty to destroy\r\nthe Union, it was his sworn duty to preserve it; that the least he\r\ncould do, under the obligations of his oath, was to possess and hold the\r\nproperty of the United States; that he hoped to do this peaceably; that\r\nhe abhorred war for any purpose, and that they would have none\r\nunless they themselves were the aggressors. It was a masterpiece of\r\npersuasiveness, and while Lincoln had accepted many valuable amendments\r\nsuggested by Seward, it was essentially his own. Probably Lincoln\r\nhimself did not expect his inaugural address to have any effect upon the\r\nsecessionists, for he must have known them to be resolved upon disunion\r\nat any cost. But it was an appeal to the wavering minds in the North,\r\nand upon them it made a profound impression. Every candid man, however\r\ntimid and halting, had to admit that the President was bound by his oath\r\nto do his duty; that under that oath he could do no less than he said\r\nhe would do; that if the secessionists resisted such an appeal as\r\nthe President had made, they were bent upon mischief, and that the\r\ngovernment must be supported against them. The partisan sympathy with\r\nthe Southern insurrection which still existed in the North did indeed\r\nnot disappear, but it diminished perceptibly under the influence of such\r\nreasoning. Those who still resisted it did so at the risk of appearing\r\nunpatriotic.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that Lincoln at once succeeded in\r\npleasing everybody, even among his friends,--even among those nearest to\r\nhim. In selecting his cabinet, which he did substantially before he left\r\nSpringfield for Washington, he thought it wise to call to his assistance\r\nthe strong men of his party, especially those who had given evidence of\r\nthe support they commanded as his competitors in the Chicago convention.\r\nIn them he found at the same time representatives of the\r\ndifferent shades of opinion within the party, and of the different\r\nelements--former Whigs and former Democrats--from which the party had\r\nrecruited itself. This was sound policy under the circumstances. It\r\nmight indeed have been foreseen that among the members of a cabinet so\r\ncomposed, troublesome disagreements and rivalries would break out. But\r\nit was better for the President to have these strong and ambitious\r\nmen near him as his co-operators than to have them as his critics in\r\nCongress, where their differences might have been composed in a common\r\nopposition to him. As members of his cabinet he could hope to control\r\nthem, and to keep them busily employed in the service of a common\r\npurpose, if he had the strength to do so. Whether he did possess this\r\nstrength was soon tested by a singularly rude trial.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the foremost members of his cabinet, Seward\r\nand Chase, the most eminent Republican statesmen, had felt themselves\r\nwronged by their party when in its national convention it preferred\r\nto them for the Presidency a man whom, not unnaturally, they thought\r\ngreatly their inferior in ability and experience as well as in service.\r\nThe soreness of that disappointment was intensified when they saw this\r\nWestern man in the White House, with so much of rustic manner and speech\r\nas still clung to him, meeting his fellow-citizens, high and low, on a\r\nfooting of equality, with the simplicity of his good nature unburdened\r\nby any conventional dignity of deportment, and dealing with the great\r\nbusiness of state in an easy-going, unmethodical, and apparently\r\nsomewhat irreverent way. They did not understand such a man. Especially\r\nSeward, who, as Secretary of State, considered himself next to the\r\nChief Executive, and who quickly accustomed himself to giving orders and\r\nmaking arrangements upon his own motion, thought it necessary that he\r\nshould rescue the direction of public affairs from hands so unskilled,\r\nand take full charge of them himself. At the end of the first month of\r\nthe administration he submitted a \"memorandum\" to President Lincoln,\r\nwhich has been first brought to light by Nicolay and Hay, and is one of\r\ntheir most valuable contributions to the history of those days. In that\r\npaper Seward actually told the President that at the end of a month's\r\nadministration the government was still without a policy, either\r\ndomestic or foreign; that the slavery question should be eliminated from\r\nthe struggle about the Union; that the matter of the maintenance of the\r\nforts and other possessions in the South should be decided with that\r\nview; that explanations should be demanded categorically from the\r\ngovernments of Spain and France, which were then preparing, one for the\r\nannexation of San Domingo, and both for the invasion of Mexico; that\r\nif no satisfactory explanations were received war should be declared\r\nagainst Spain and France by the United States; that explanations should\r\nalso be sought from Russia and Great Britain, and a vigorous continental\r\nspirit of independence against European intervention be aroused all over\r\nthe American continent; that this policy should be incessantly pursued\r\nand directed by somebody; that either the President should devote\r\nhimself entirely to it, or devolve the direction on some member of his\r\ncabinet, whereupon all debate on this policy must end.\r\n\r\nThis could be understood only as a formal demand that the President\r\nshould acknowledge his own incompetency to perform his duties, content\r\nhimself with the amusement of distributing post-offices, and resign his\r\npower as to all important affairs into the hands of his Secretary of\r\nState. It seems to-day incomprehensible how a statesman of Seward's\r\ncalibre could at that period conceive a plan of policy in which the\r\nslavery question had no place; a policy which rested upon the utterly\r\ndelusive assumption that the secessionists, who had already formed their\r\nSouthern Confederacy and were with stern resolution preparing to fight\r\nfor its independence, could be hoodwinked back into the Union by some\r\nsentimental demonstration against European interference; a policy which,\r\nat that critical moment, would have involved the Union in a foreign war,\r\nthus inviting foreign intervention in favor of the Southern Confederacy,\r\nand increasing tenfold its chances in the struggle for independence. But\r\nit is equally incomprehensible how Seward could fail to see that this\r\ndemand of an unconditional surrender was a mortal insult to the head\r\nof the government, and that by putting his proposition on paper he\r\ndelivered himself into the hands of the very man he had insulted; for,\r\nhad Lincoln, as most Presidents would have done, instantly dismissed\r\nSeward, and published the true reason for that dismissal, it would\r\ninevitably have been the end of Seward's career. But Lincoln did what\r\nnot many of the noblest and greatest men in history would have been\r\nnoble and great enough to do. He considered that Seward was still\r\ncapable of rendering great service to his country in the place in\r\nwhich he was, if rightly controlled. He ignored the insult, but\r\nfirmly established his superiority. In his reply, which he forthwith\r\ndespatched, he told Seward that the administration had a domestic policy\r\nas laid down in the inaugural address with Seward's approval; that\r\nit had a foreign policy as traced in Seward's despatches with the\r\nPresident's approval; that if any policy was to be maintained or\r\nchanged, he, the President, was to direct that on his responsibility;\r\nand that in performing that duty the President had a right to the\r\nadvice of his secretaries. Seward's fantastic schemes of foreign war\r\nand continental policies Lincoln brushed aside by passing them over in\r\nsilence. Nothing more was said. Seward must have felt that he was at\r\nthe mercy of a superior man; that his offensive proposition had been\r\ngenerously pardoned as a temporary aberration of a great mind, and that\r\nhe could atone for it only by devoted personal loyalty. This he did.\r\nHe was thoroughly subdued, and thenceforth submitted to Lincoln his\r\ndespatches for revision and amendment without a murmur. The war with\r\nEuropean nations was no longer thought of; the slavery question found in\r\ndue time its proper place in the struggle for the Union; and when, at\r\na later period, the dismissal of Seward was demanded by dissatisfied\r\nsenators, who attributed to him the shortcomings of the administration,\r\nLincoln stood stoutly by his faithful Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nChase, the Secretary of the Treasury, a man of superb presence, of\r\neminent ability and ardent patriotism, of great natural dignity and a\r\ncertain outward coldness of manner, which made him appear more difficult\r\nof approach than he really was, did not permit his disappointment to\r\nburst out in such extravagant demonstrations. But Lincoln's ways were\r\nso essentially different from his that they never became quite\r\nintelligible, and certainly not congenial to him. It might, perhaps,\r\nhave been better had there been, at the beginning of the administration,\r\nsome decided clash between Lincoln and Chase, as there was between\r\nLincoln and Seward, to bring on a full mutual explanation, and to make\r\nChase appreciate the real seriousness of Lincoln's nature. But, as it\r\nwas, their relations always remained somewhat formal, and Chase never\r\nfelt quite at ease under a chief whom he could not understand, and whose\r\ncharacter and powers he never learned to esteem at their true value.\r\nAt the same time, he devoted himself zealously to the duties of his\r\ndepartment, and did the country arduous service under circumstances of\r\nextreme difficulty. Nobody recognized this more heartily than Lincoln\r\nhimself, and they managed to work together until near the end of\r\nLincoln's first Presidential term, when Chase, after some disagreements\r\nconcerning appointments to office, resigned from the treasury; and,\r\nafter Taney's death, the President made him Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cabinet consisted of men of less eminence, who\r\nsubordinated themselves more easily. In January, 1862, Lincoln found it\r\nnecessary to bow Cameron out of the war office, and to put in his place\r\nEdwin M. Stanton, a man of intensely practical mind, vehement impulses,\r\nfierce positiveness, ruthless energy, immense working power, lofty\r\npatriotism, and severest devotion to duty. He accepted the war office\r\nnot as a partisan, for he had never been a Republican, but only to\r\ndo all he could in \"helping to save the country.\" The manner in\r\nwhich Lincoln succeeded in taming this lion to his will, by frankly\r\nrecognizing his great qualities, by giving him the most generous\r\nconfidence, by aiding him in his work to the full of his power, by\r\nkindly concession or affectionate persuasiveness in cases of differing\r\nopinions, or, when it was necessary, by firm assertions of superior\r\nauthority, bears the highest testimony to his skill in the management of\r\nmen. Stanton, who had entered the service with rather a mean opinion\r\nof Lincoln's character and capacity, became one of his warmest, most\r\ndevoted, and most admiring friends, and with none of his secretaries\r\nwas Lincoln's intercourse more intimate. To take advice with candid\r\nreadiness, and to weigh it without any pride of his own opinion, was one\r\nof Lincoln's preeminent virtues; but he had not long presided over his\r\ncabinet council when his was felt by all its members to be the ruling\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe cautious policy foreshadowed in his inaugural address, and pursued\r\nduring the first period of the civil war, was far from satisfying all\r\nhis party friends. The ardent spirits among the Union men thought that\r\nthe whole North should at once be called to arms, to crush the rebellion\r\nby one powerful blow. The ardent spirits among the antislavery men\r\ninsisted that, slavery having brought forth the rebellion, this powerful\r\nblow should at once be aimed at slavery. Both complained that the\r\nadministration was spiritless, undecided, and lamentably slow in its\r\nproceedings. Lincoln reasoned otherwise. The ways of thinking and\r\nfeeling of the masses, of the plain people, were constantly present to\r\nhis mind. The masses, the plain people, had to furnish the men for the\r\nfighting, if fighting was to be done. He believed that the plain people\r\nwould be ready to fight when it clearly appeared necessary, and that\r\nthey would feel that necessity when they felt themselves attacked. He\r\ntherefore waited until the enemies of the Union struck the first blow.\r\nAs soon as, on the 12th of April, 1861, the first gun was fired in\r\nCharleston harbor on the Union flag upon Fort Sumter, the call was\r\nsounded, and the Northern people rushed to arms.\r\n\r\nLincoln knew that the plain people were now indeed ready to fight in\r\ndefence of the Union, but not yet ready to fight for the destruction of\r\nslavery. He declared openly that he had a right to summon the people to\r\nfight for the Union, but not to summon them to fight for the abolition\r\nof slavery as a primary object; and this declaration gave him numberless\r\nsoldiers for the Union who at that period would have hesitated to do\r\nbattle against the institution of slavery. For a time he succeeded\r\nin rendering harmless the cry of the partisan opposition that the\r\nRepublican administration were perverting the war for the Union into an\r\n\"abolition war.\" But when he went so far as to countermand the acts of\r\nsome generals in the field, looking to the emancipation of the slaves\r\nin the districts covered by their commands, loud complaints arose from\r\nearnest antislavery men, who accused the President of turning his back\r\nupon the antislavery cause. Many of these antislavery men will now,\r\nafter a calm retrospect, be willing to admit that it would have been\r\na hazardous policy to endanger, by precipitating a demonstrative fight\r\nagainst slavery, the success of the struggle for the Union.\r\n\r\nLincoln's views and feelings concerning slavery had not changed. Those\r\nwho conversed with him intimately upon the subject at that period know\r\nthat he did not expect slavery long to survive the triumph of the Union,\r\neven if it were not immediately destroyed by the war. In this he was\r\nright. Had the Union armies achieved a decisive victory in an early\r\nperiod of the conflict, and had the seceded States been received back\r\nwith slavery, the \"slave power\" would then have been a defeated power,\r\ndefeated in an attempt to carry out its most effective threat. It would\r\nhave lost its prestige. Its menaces would have been hollow sound, and\r\nceased to make any one afraid. It could no longer have hoped to expand,\r\nto maintain an equilibrium in any branch of Congress, and to control the\r\ngovernment. The victorious free States would have largely overbalanced\r\nit. It would no longer have been able to withstand the onset of a\r\nhostile age. It could no longer have ruled,--and slavery had to rule in\r\norder to live. It would have lingered for a while, but it would surely\r\nhave been \"in the course of ultimate extinction.\" A prolonged war\r\nprecipitated the destruction of slavery; a short war might only have\r\nprolonged its death struggle. Lincoln saw this clearly; but he saw also\r\nthat, in a protracted death struggle, it might still have kept disloyal\r\nsentiments alive, bred distracting commotions, and caused great mischief\r\nto the country. He therefore hoped that slavery would not survive the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBut the question how he could rightfully employ his power to bring on\r\nits speedy destruction was to him not a question of mere sentiment. He\r\nhimself set forth his reasoning upon it, at a later period, in one\r\nof his inimitable letters. \"I am naturally antislavery,\" said he. \"If\r\nslavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I cannot remember the time when\r\nI did not so think and feel. And yet I have never understood that the\r\nPresidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act upon that\r\njudgment and feeling. It was in the oath I took that I would, to the\r\nbest of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. I could not take the office without taking the oath.\r\nNor was it my view that I might take an oath to get power, and break\r\nthe oath in using that power. I understood, too, that, in ordinary civil\r\nadministration, this oath even forbade me practically to indulge my\r\nprivate abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery. I did\r\nunderstand, however, also, that my oath imposed upon me the duty of\r\npreserving, to the best of my ability, by every indispensable means,\r\nthat government, that nation, of which the Constitution was the organic\r\nlaw. I could not feel that, to the best of my ability, I had even tied\r\nto preserve the Constitution--if, to save slavery, or any minor matter,\r\nI should permit the wreck of government, country, and Constitution\r\nall together.\" In other words, if the salvation of the government, the\r\nConstitution, and the Union demanded the destruction of slavery, he\r\nfelt it to be not only his right, but his sworn duty to destroy it. Its\r\ndestruction became a necessity of the war for the Union.\r\n\r\nAs the war dragged on and disaster followed disaster, the sense of that\r\nnecessity steadily grew upon him. Early in 1862, as some of his friends\r\nwell remember, he saw, what Seward seemed not to see, that to give\r\nthe war for the Union an antislavery character was the surest means to\r\nprevent the recognition of the Southern Confederacy as an independent\r\nnation by European powers; that, slavery being abhorred by the moral\r\nsense of civilized mankind, no European government would dare to offer\r\nso gross an insult to the public opinion of its people as openly to\r\nfavor the creation of a state founded upon slavery to the prejudice of\r\nan existing nation fighting against slavery. He saw also that slavery\r\nuntouched was to the rebellion an element of power, and that in order\r\nto overcome that power it was necessary to turn it into an element\r\nof weakness. Still, he felt no assurance that the plain people were\r\nprepared for so radical a measure as the emancipation of the slaves by\r\nact of the government, and he anxiously considered that, if they were\r\nnot, this great step might, by exciting dissension at the North, injure\r\nthe cause of the Union in one quarter more than it would help it in\r\nanother. He heartily welcomed an effort made in New York to mould and\r\nstimulate public sentiment on the slavery question by public meetings\r\nboldly pronouncing for emancipation. At the same time he himself\r\ncautiously advanced with a recommendation, expressed in a special\r\nmessage to Congress, that the United States should co-operate with any\r\nState which might adopt the gradual abolishment of slavery, giving\r\nsuch State pecuniary aid to compensate the former owners of emancipated\r\nslaves. The discussion was started, and spread rapidly. Congress adopted\r\nthe resolution recommended, and soon went a step farther in passing a\r\nbill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia. The plain people\r\nbegan to look at emancipation on a larger scale as a thing to be\r\nconsidered seriously by patriotic citizens; and soon Lincoln thought\r\nthat the time was ripe, and that the edict of freedom could be ventured\r\nupon without danger of serious confusion in the Union ranks.\r\n\r\nThe failure of McClellan's movement upon Richmond increased immensely\r\nthe prestige of the enemy. The need of some great act to stimulate the\r\nvitality of the Union cause seemed to grow daily more pressing. On\r\nJuly 21, 1862, Lincoln surprised his cabinet with the draught of a\r\nproclamation declaring free the slaves in all the States that should be\r\nstill in rebellion against the United States on the 1st of January,1863.\r\nAs to the matter itself he announced that he had fully made up his mind;\r\nhe invited advice only concerning the form and the time of publication.\r\nSeward suggested that the proclamation, if then brought out, amidst\r\ndisaster and distress, would sound like the last shriek of a perishing\r\ncause. Lincoln accepted the suggestion, and the proclamation was\r\npostponed. Another defeat followed, the second at Bull Run. But when,\r\nafter that battle, the Confederate army, under Lee, crossed the Potomac\r\nand invaded Maryland, Lincoln vowed in his heart that, if the Union army\r\nwere now blessed with success, the decree of freedom should surely\r\nbe issued. The victory of Antietam was won on September 17, and the\r\npreliminary Emancipation Proclamation came forth on the a 22d. It was\r\nLincoln's own resolution and act; but practically it bound the nation,\r\nand permitted no step backward. In spite of its limitations, it was the\r\nactual abolition of slavery. Thus he wrote his name upon the books of\r\nhistory with the title dearest to his heart, the liberator of the slave.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the great proclamation, which stamped the war as one for\r\n\"union and freedom,\" did not at once mark the turning of the tide on the\r\nfield of military operations. There were more disasters, Fredericksburg\r\nand Chancellorsville. But with Gettysburg and Vicksburg the whole aspect\r\nof the war changed. Step by step, now more slowly, then more rapidly,\r\nbut with increasing steadiness, the flag of the Union advanced from\r\nfield to field toward the final consummation. The decree of emancipation\r\nwas naturally followed by the enlistment of emancipated negroes in the\r\nUnion armies. This measure had a anther reaching effect than merely\r\ngiving the Union armies an increased supply of men. The laboring force\r\nof the rebellion was hopelessly disorganized. The war became like a\r\nproblem of arithmetic. As the Union armies pushed forward, the area\r\nfrom which the Southern Confederacy could draw recruits and supplies\r\nconstantly grew smaller, while the area from which the Union recruited\r\nits strength constantly grew larger; and everywhere, even within the\r\nSouthern lines, the Union had its allies. The fate of the rebellion\r\nwas then virtually decided; but it still required much bloody work to\r\nconvince the brave warriors who fought for it that they were really\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nNeither did the Emancipation Proclamation forthwith command universal\r\nassent among the people who were loyal to the Union. There were even\r\nsigns of a reaction against the administration in the fall elections of\r\n1862, seemingly justifying the opinion, entertained by many, that the\r\nPresident had really anticipated the development of popular feeling. The\r\ncry that the war for the Union had been turned into an \"abolition war\"\r\nwas raised again by the opposition, and more loudly than ever. But\r\nthe good sense and patriotic instincts of the plain people gradually\r\nmarshalled themselves on Lincoln's side, and he lost no opportunity to\r\nhelp on this process by personal argument and admonition. There never\r\nhas been a President in such constant and active contact with the public\r\nopinion of the country, as there never has been a President who, while\r\nat the head of the government, remained so near to the people. Beyond\r\nthe circle of those who had long known him the feeling steadily grew\r\nthat the man in the White House was \"honest Abe Lincoln\" still, and\r\nthat every citizen might approach him with complaint, expostulation, or\r\nadvice, without danger of meeting a rebuff from power-proud authority,\r\nor humiliating condescension; and this privilege was used by so many\r\nand with such unsparing freedom that only superhuman patience could\r\nhave endured it all. There are men now living who would to-day read with\r\namazement, if not regret, what they ventured to say or write to him. But\r\nLincoln repelled no one whom he believed to speak to him in good faith\r\nand with patriotic purpose. No good advice would go unheeded. No candid\r\ncriticism would offend him. No honest opposition, while it might pain\r\nhim, would produce a lasting alienation of feeling between him and the\r\nopponent. It may truly be said that few men in power have ever been\r\nexposed to more daring attempts to direct their course, to severer\r\ncensure of their acts, and to more cruel misrepresentation of their\r\nmotives: And all this he met with that good-natured humor peculiarly his\r\nown, and with untiring effort to see the right and to impress it\r\nupon those who differed from him. The conversations he had and the\r\ncorrespondence he carried on upon matters of public interest, not only\r\nwith men in official position, but with private citizens, were almost\r\nunceasing, and in a large number of public letters, written ostensibly\r\nto meetings, or committees, or persons of importance, he addressed\r\nhimself directly to the popular mind. Most of these letters stand among\r\nthe finest monuments of our political literature. Thus he presented the\r\nsingular spectacle of a President who, in the midst of a great civil\r\nwar, with unprecedented duties weighing upon him, was constantly in\r\nperson debating the great features of his policy with the people.\r\n\r\nWhile in this manner he exercised an ever-increasing influence upon the\r\npopular understanding, his sympathetic nature endeared him more and\r\nmore to the popular heart. In vain did journals and speakers of the\r\nopposition represent him as a lightminded trifler, who amused himself\r\nwith frivolous story-telling and coarse jokes, while the blood of the\r\npeople was flowing in streams. The people knew that the man at the head\r\nof affairs, on whose haggard face the twinkle of humor so frequently\r\nchanged into an expression of profoundest sadness, was more than any\r\nother deeply distressed by the suffering he witnessed; that he felt\r\nthe pain of every wound that was inflicted on the battlefield, and the\r\nanguish of every woman or child who had lost husband or father; that\r\nwhenever he could he was eager to alleviate sorrow, and that his mercy\r\nwas never implored in vain. They looked to him as one who was with them\r\nand of them in all their hopes and fears, their joys and sorrows, who\r\nlaughed with them and wept with them; and as his heart was theirs; so\r\ntheir hearts turned to him. His popularity was far different from\r\nthat of Washington, who was revered with awe, or that of Jackson,\r\nthe unconquerable hero, for whom party enthusiasm never grew weary\r\nof shouting. To Abraham Lincoln the people became bound by a genuine\r\nsentimental attachment. It was not a matter of respect, or confidence,\r\nor party pride, for this feeling spread far beyond the boundary lines of\r\nhis party; it was an affair of the heart, independent of mere reasoning.\r\nWhen the soldiers in the field or their folks at home spoke of \"Father\r\nAbraham,\" there was no cant in it. They felt that their President was\r\nreally caring for them as a father would, and that they could go to him,\r\nevery one of them, as they would go to a father, and talk to him of what\r\ntroubled them, sure to find a willing ear and tender sympathy. Thus,\r\ntheir President, and his cause, and his endeavors, and his success\r\ngradually became to them almost matters of family concern. And this\r\npopularity carried him triumphantly through the Presidential election\r\nof 1864, in spite of an opposition within his own party which at first\r\nseemed very formidable.\r\n\r\nMany of the radical antislavery men were never quite satisfied with\r\nLincoln's ways of meeting the problems of the time. They were very\r\nearnest and mostly very able men, who had positive ideas as to \"how this\r\nrebellion should be put down.\" They would not recognize the necessity\r\nof measuring the steps of the government according to the progress\r\nof opinion among the plain people. They criticised Lincoln's cautious\r\nmanagement as irresolute, halting, lacking in definite purpose and in\r\nenergy; he should not have delayed emancipation so long; he should not\r\nhave confided important commands to men of doubtful views as to slavery;\r\nhe should have authorized military commanders to set the slaves free\r\nas they went on; he dealt too leniently with unsuccessful generals; he\r\nshould have put down all factious opposition with a strong hand instead\r\nof trying to pacify it; he should have given the people accomplished\r\nfacts instead of arguing with them, and so on. It is true, these\r\ncriticisms were not always entirely unfounded. Lincoln's policy had,\r\nwith the virtues of democratic government, some of its weaknesses, which\r\nin the presence of pressing exigencies were apt to deprive governmental\r\naction of the necessary vigor; and his kindness of heart, his\r\ndisposition always to respect the feelings of others, frequently made\r\nhim recoil from anything like severity, even when severity was urgently\r\ncalled for. But many of his radical critics have since then revised\r\ntheir judgment sufficiently to admit that Lincoln's policy was, on the\r\nwhole, the wisest and safest; that a policy of heroic methods, while it\r\nhas sometimes accomplished great results, could in a democracy like\r\nours be maintained only by constant success; that it would have quickly\r\nbroken down under the weight of disaster; that it might have been\r\nsuccessful from the start, had the Union, at the beginning of the\r\nconflict, had its Grants and Shermans and Sheridans, its Farraguts and\r\nPorters, fully matured at the head of its forces; but that, as the great\r\ncommanders had to be evolved slowly from the developments of the war,\r\nconstant success could not be counted upon, and it was best to follow\r\na policy which was in friendly contact with the popular force, and\r\ntherefore more fit to stand trial of misfortune on the battlefield. But\r\nat that period they thought differently, and their dissatisfaction with\r\nLincoln's doings was greatly increased by the steps he took toward the\r\nreconstruction of rebel States then partially in possession of the Union\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1863, Lincoln issued an amnesty proclamation, offering\r\npardon to all implicated in the rebellion, with certain specified\r\nexceptions, on condition of their taking and maintaining an oath to\r\nsupport the Constitution and obey the laws of the United States and the\r\nproclamations of the President with regard to slaves; and also promising\r\nthat when, in any of the rebel States, a number of citizens equal to one\r\ntenth of the voters in 1860 should re-establish a state government in\r\nconformity with the oath above mentioned, such should be recognized\r\nby the Executive as the true government of the State. The proclamation\r\nseemed at first to be received with general favor. But soon another\r\nscheme of reconstruction, much more stringent in its provisions, was put\r\nforward in the House of Representatives by Henry Winter Davis. Benjamin\r\nWade championed it in the Senate. It passed in the closing moments of\r\nthe session in July, 1864, and Lincoln, instead of making it a law by\r\nhis signature, embodied the text of it in a proclamation as a plan of\r\nreconstruction worthy of being earnestly considered. The differences of\r\nopinion concerning this subject had only intensified the feeling against\r\nLincoln which had long been nursed among the radicals, and some of\r\nthem openly declared their purpose of resisting his re-election to\r\nthe Presidency. Similar sentiments were manifested by the advanced\r\nantislavery men of Missouri, who, in their hot faction-fight with the\r\n\"conservatives\" of that State, had not received from Lincoln the active\r\nsupport they demanded. Still another class of Union men, mainly in the\r\nEast, gravely shook their heads when considering the question whether\r\nLincoln should be re-elected. They were those who cherished in their\r\nminds an ideal of statesmanship and of personal bearing in high office\r\nwith which, in their opinion, Lincoln's individuality was much out of\r\naccord. They were shocked when they heard him cap an argument upon grave\r\naffairs of state with a story about \"a man out in Sangamon County,\"--a\r\nstory, to be sure, strikingly clinching his point, but sadly lacking in\r\ndignity. They could not understand the man who was capable, in opening\r\na cabinet meeting, of reading to his secretaries a funny chapter from a\r\nrecent book of Artemus Ward, with which in an unoccupied moment he had\r\nrelieved his care-burdened mind, and who then solemnly informed the\r\nexecutive council that he had vowed in his heart to issue a proclamation\r\nemancipating the slaves as soon as God blessed the Union arms with\r\nanother victory. They were alarmed at the weakness of a President who\r\nwould indeed resist the urgent remonstrances of statesmen against his\r\npolicy, but could not resist the prayer of an old woman for the pardon\r\nof a soldier who was sentenced to be shot for desertion. Such men,\r\nmostly sincere and ardent patriots, not only wished, but earnestly set\r\nto work, to prevent Lincoln's renomination. Not a few of them actually\r\nbelieved, in 1863, that, if the national convention of the Union party\r\nwere held then, Lincoln would not be supported by the delegation of a\r\nsingle State. But when the convention met at Baltimore, in June, 1864,\r\nthe voice of the people was heard. On the first ballot Lincoln received\r\nthe votes of the delegations from all the States except Missouri; and\r\neven the Missourians turned over their votes to him before the result of\r\nthe ballot was declared.\r\n\r\nBut even after his renomination the opposition to Lincoln within the\r\nranks of the Union party did not subside. A convention, called by the\r\ndissatisfied radicals in Missouri, and favored by men of a similar\r\nway of thinking in other States, had been held already in May, and\r\nhad nominated as its candidate for the Presidency General Fremont. He,\r\nindeed, did not attract a strong following, but opposition movements\r\nfrom different quarters appeared more formidable. Henry Winter Davis and\r\nBenjamin Wade assailed Lincoln in a flaming manifesto. Other Union men,\r\nof undoubted patriotism and high standing, persuaded themselves, and\r\nsought to persuade the people, that Lincoln's renomination was ill\r\nadvised and dangerous to the Union cause. As the Democrats had put off\r\ntheir convention until the 29th of August, the Union party had, during\r\nthe larger part of the summer, no opposing candidate and platform to\r\nattack, and the political campaign languished. Neither were the tidings\r\nfrom the theatre of war of a cheering character. The terrible losses\r\nsuffered by Grant's army in the battles of the Wilderness spread general\r\ngloom. Sherman seemed for a while to be in a precarious position before\r\nAtlanta. The opposition to Lincoln within the Union party grew louder in\r\nits complaints and discouraging predictions. Earnest demands were heard\r\nthat his candidacy should be withdrawn. Lincoln himself, not knowing\r\nhow strongly the masses were attached to him, was haunted by dark\r\nforebodings of defeat. Then the scene suddenly changed as if by magic.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, in their national convention, declared the war a failure,\r\ndemanded, substantially, peace at any price, and nominated on such a\r\nplatform General McClellan as their candidate. Their convention had\r\nhardly adjourned when the capture of Atlanta gave a new aspect to the\r\nmilitary situation. It was like a sun-ray bursting through a dark\r\ncloud. The rank and file of the Union party rose with rapidly growing\r\nenthusiasm. The song \"We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred\r\nthousand strong,\" resounded all over the land. Long before the decisive\r\nday arrived, the result was beyond doubt, and Lincoln was re-elected\r\nPresident by overwhelming majorities. The election over even his\r\nseverest critics found themselves forced to admit that Lincoln was the\r\nonly possible candidate for the Union party in 1864, and that neither\r\npolitical combinations nor campaign speeches, nor even victories in the\r\nfield, were needed to insure his success. The plain people had all the\r\nwhile been satisfied with Abraham Lincoln: they confided in him; they\r\nloved him; they felt themselves near to him; they saw personified in him\r\nthe cause of Union and freedom; and they went to the ballot-box for him\r\nin their strength.\r\n\r\nThe hour of triumph called out the characteristic impulses of his\r\nnature. The opposition within the Union party had stung him to the\r\nquick. Now he had his opponents before him, baffled and humiliated. Not\r\na moment did he lose to stretch out the hand of friendship to all. \"Now\r\nthat the election is over,\" he said, in response to a serenade, \"may not\r\nall, having a common interest, reunite in a common effort to save our\r\ncommon country? For my own part, I have striven, and will strive, to\r\nplace no obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here I have not\r\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I am deeply\r\nsensible to the high compliment of a re-election, it adds nothing to\r\nmy satisfaction that any other man may be pained or disappointed by the\r\nresult. May I ask those who were with me to join with me in the same\r\nspirit toward those who were against me?\" This was Abraham Lincoln's\r\ncharacter as tested in the furnace of prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe war was virtually decided, but not yet ended. Sherman was\r\nirresistibly carrying the Union flag through the South. Grant had his\r\niron hand upon the ramparts of Richmond. The days of the Confederacy\r\nwere evidently numbered. Only the last blow remained to be struck. Then\r\nLincoln's second inauguration came, and with it his second inaugural\r\naddress. Lincoln's famous \"Gettysburg speech\" has been much and justly\r\nadmired. But far greater, as well as far more characteristic, was that\r\ninaugural in which he poured out the whole devotion and tenderness of\r\nhis great soul. It had all the solemnity of a father's last admonition\r\nand blessing to his children before he lay down to die. These were\r\nits closing words: \"Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this\r\nmighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet if God wills that it\r\ncontinue until all the wealth piled up by the bondman's two hundred and\r\nfifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of\r\nblood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword,\r\nas was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, `The\r\njudgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.' With malice\r\ntoward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God\r\ngives us to see the right, let us strive to finish the work we are in;\r\nto bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the\r\nbattle, and for his widow and his orphan; to do all which may achieve\r\nand cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nThis was like a sacred poem. No American President had ever spoken words\r\nlike these to the American people. America never had a President who\r\nfound such words in the depth of his heart.\r\n\r\nNow followed the closing scenes of the war. The Southern armies fought\r\nbravely to the last, but all in vain. Richmond fell. Lincoln himself\r\nentered the city on foot, accompanied only by a few officers and a\r\nsquad of sailors who had rowed him ashore from the flotilla in the James\r\nRiver, a negro picked up on the way serving as a guide. Never had the\r\nworld seen a more modest conqueror and a more characteristic triumphal\r\nprocession, no army with banners and drums, only a throng of those who\r\nhad been slaves, hastily run together, escorting the victorious chief\r\ninto the capital of the vanquished foe. We are told that they pressed\r\naround him, kissed his hands and his garments, and shouted and danced\r\nfor joy, while tears ran down the President's care-furrowed cheeks.\r\n\r\nA few days more brought the surrender of Lee's army, and peace was\r\nassured. The people of the North were wild with joy. Everywhere\r\nfestive guns were booming, bells pealing, the churches ringing with\r\nthanksgivings, and jubilant multitudes thronging the thoroughfares, when\r\nsuddenly the news flashed over the land that Abraham Lincoln had been\r\nmurdered. The people were stunned by the blow. Then a wail of sorrow\r\nwent up such as America had never heard before. Thousands of Northern\r\nhouseholds grieved as if they had lost their dearest member. Many a\r\nSouthern man cried out in his heart that his people had been robbed\r\nof their best friend in their humiliation and distress, when Abraham\r\nLincoln was struck down. It was as if the tender affection which his\r\ncountrymen bore him had inspired all nations with a common sentiment.\r\nAll civilized mankind stood mourning around the coffin of the dead\r\nPresident. Many of those, here and abroad, who not long before had\r\nridiculed and reviled him were among the first to hasten on with their\r\nflowers of eulogy, and in that universal chorus of lamentation and\r\npraise there was not a voice that did not tremble with genuine emotion.\r\nNever since Washington's death had there been such unanimity of judgment\r\nas to a man's virtues and greatness; and even Washington's death,\r\nalthough his name was held in greater reverence, did not touch so\r\nsympathetic a chord in the people's hearts.\r\n\r\nNor can it be said that this was owing to the tragic character of\r\nLincoln's end. It is true, the death of this gentlest and most merciful\r\nof rulers by the hand of a mad fanatic was well apt to exalt him beyond\r\nhis merits in the estimation of those who loved him, and to make his\r\nrenown the object of peculiarly tender solicitude. But it is also true\r\nthat the verdict pronounced upon him in those days has been affected\r\nlittle by time, and that historical inquiry has served rather to\r\nincrease than to lessen the appreciation of his virtues, his abilities,\r\nhis services. Giving the fullest measure of credit to his great\r\nministers,--to Seward for his conduct of foreign affairs, to Chase for\r\nthe management of the finances under terrible difficulties, to Stanton\r\nfor the performance of his tremendous task as war secretary,--and\r\nreadily acknowledging that without the skill and fortitude of the great\r\ncommanders, and the heroism of the soldiers and sailors under them,\r\nsuccess could not have been achieved, the historian still finds that\r\nLincoln's judgment and will were by no means governed by those around\r\nhim; that the most important steps were owing to his initiative; that\r\nhis was the deciding and directing mind; and that it was pre-eminently\r\nhe whose sagacity and whose character enlisted for the administration\r\nin its struggles the countenance, the sympathy, and the support of the\r\npeople. It is found, even, that his judgment on military matters was\r\nastonishingly acute, and that the advice and instructions he gave to the\r\ngenerals commanding in the field would not seldom have done honor to the\r\nablest of them. History, therefore, without overlooking, or palliating,\r\nor excusing any of his shortcomings or mistakes, continues to place\r\nhim foremost among the saviours of the Union and the liberators of the\r\nslave. More than that, it awards to him the merit of having accomplished\r\nwhat but few political philosophers would have recognized as\r\npossible,--of leading the republic through four years of furious civil\r\nconflict without any serious detriment to its free institutions.\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, while President, violently denounced by the opposition\r\nas a tyrant and a usurper, for having gone beyond his constitutional\r\npowers in authorizing or permitting the temporary suppression of\r\nnewspapers, and in wantonly suspending the writ of habeas corpus and\r\nresorting to arbitrary arrests. Nobody should be blamed who, when such\r\nthings are done, in good faith and from patriotic motives protests\r\nagainst them. In a republic, arbitrary stretches of power, even when\r\ndemanded by necessity, should never be permitted to pass without a\r\nprotest on the one hand, and without an apology on the other. It is well\r\nthey did not so pass during our civil war. That arbitrary measures were\r\nresorted to is true. That they were resorted to most sparingly, and only\r\nwhen the government thought them absolutely required by the safety of\r\nthe republic, will now hardly be denied. But certain it is that the\r\nhistory of the world does not furnish a single example of a government\r\npassing through so tremendous a crisis as our civil war was with so\r\nsmall a record of arbitrary acts, and so little interference with the\r\nordinary course of law outside the field of military operations. No\r\nAmerican President ever wielded such power as that which was thrust into\r\nLincoln's hands. It is to be hoped that no American President ever\r\nwill have to be entrusted with such power again. But no man was ever\r\nentrusted with it to whom its seductions were less dangerous than they\r\nproved to be to Abraham Lincoln. With scrupulous care he endeavored,\r\neven under the most trying circumstances, to remain strictly within the\r\nconstitutional limitations of his authority; and whenever the boundary\r\nbecame indistinct, or when the dangers of the situation forced him\r\nto cross it, he was equally careful to mark his acts as exceptional\r\nmeasures, justifiable only by the imperative necessities of the civil\r\nwar, so that they might not pass into history as precedents for similar\r\nacts in time of peace. It is an unquestionable fact that during the\r\nreconstruction period which followed the war, more things were done\r\ncapable of serving as dangerous precedents than during the war itself.\r\nThus it may truly be said of him not only that under his guidance the\r\nrepublic was saved from disruption and the country was purified of the\r\nblot of slavery, but that, during the stormiest and most perilous crisis\r\nin our history, he so conducted the government and so wielded his almost\r\ndictatorial power as to leave essentially intact our free institutions\r\nin all things that concern the rights and liberties of the citizens.\r\nHe understood well the nature of the problem. In his first message to\r\nCongress he defined it in admirably pointed language: \"Must a government\r\nbe of necessity too strong for the liberties of its own people, or\r\ntoo weak to maintain its own existence? Is there in all republics this\r\ninherent weakness?\" This question he answered in the name of the great\r\nAmerican republic, as no man could have answered it better, with a\r\ntriumphant \"No....\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Abraham Lincoln died at the right moment for his\r\nfame. However that may be, he had, at the time of his death, certainly\r\nnot exhausted his usefulness to his country. He was probably the only\r\nman who could have guided the nation through the perplexities of the\r\nreconstruction period in such a manner as to prevent in the work of\r\npeace the revival of the passions of the war. He would indeed not have\r\nescaped serious controversy as to details of policy; but he could have\r\nweathered it far better than any other statesman of his time, for his\r\nprestige with the active politicians had been immensely strengthened by\r\nhis triumphant re-election; and, what is more important, he would have\r\nbeen supported by the confidence of the victorious Northern people that\r\nhe would do all to secure the safety of the Union and the rights of\r\nthe emancipated negro, and at the same time by the confidence of the\r\ndefeated Southern people that nothing would be done by him from motives\r\nof vindictiveness, or of unreasoning fanaticism, or of a selfish party\r\nspirit. \"With malice toward none, with charity for all,\" the foremost\r\nof the victors would have personified in himself the genius of\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\nHe might have rendered the country a great service in another direction.\r\nA few days after the fall of Richmond, he pointed out to a friend the\r\ncrowd of office-seekers besieging his door. \"Look at that,\" said he.\r\n\"Now we have conquered the rebellion, but here you see something that\r\nmay become more dangerous to this republic than the rebellion itself.\"\r\nIt is true, Lincoln as President did not profess what we now call civil\r\nservice reform principles. He used the patronage of the government\r\nin many cases avowedly to reward party work, in many others to form\r\ncombinations and to produce political effects advantageous to the Union\r\ncause, and in still others simply to put the right man into the right\r\nplace. But in his endeavors to strengthen the Union cause, and in his\r\nsearch for able and useful men for public duties, he frequently went\r\nbeyond the limits of his party, and gradually accustomed himself to the\r\nthought that, while party service had its value, considerations of\r\nthe public interest were, as to appointments to office, of far greater\r\nconsequence. Moreover, there had been such a mingling of different\r\npolitical elements in support of the Union during the civil war that\r\nLincoln, standing at the head of that temporarily united motley mass,\r\nhardly felt himself, in the narrow sense of the term, a party man.\r\nAnd as he became strongly impressed with the dangers brought upon the\r\nrepublic by the use of public offices as party spoils, it is by no means\r\nimprobable that, had he survived the all-absorbing crisis and found time\r\nto turn to other objects, one of the most important reforms of later\r\ndays would have been pioneered by his powerful authority. This was\r\nnot to be. But the measure of his achievements was full enough for\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\nTo the younger generation Abraham Lincoln has already become a\r\nhalf-mythical figure, which, in the haze of historic distance, grows\r\nto more and more heroic proportions, but also loses in distinctness of\r\noutline and feature. This is indeed the common lot of popular heroes;\r\nbut the Lincoln legend will be more than ordinarily apt to become\r\nfanciful, as his individuality, assembling seemingly incongruous\r\nqualities and forces in a character at the same time grand and most\r\nlovable, was so unique, and his career so abounding in startling\r\ncontrasts. As the state of society in which Abraham Lincoln grew up\r\npasses away, the world will read with increasing wonder of the man who,\r\nnot only of the humblest origin, but remaining the simplest and\r\nmost unpretending of citizens, was raised to a position of power\r\nunprecedented in our history; who was the gentlest and most peace-loving\r\nof mortals, unable to see any creature suffer without a pang in his own\r\nbreast, and suddenly found himself called to conduct the greatest and\r\nbloodiest of our wars; who wielded the power of government when stern\r\nresolution and relentless force were the order of the day and then won\r\nand ruled the popular mind and heart by the tender sympathies of his\r\nnature; who was a cautious conservative by temperament and mental habit,\r\nand led the most sudden and sweeping social revolution of our time;\r\nwho, preserving his homely speech and rustic manner even in the most\r\nconspicuous position of that period, drew upon himself the scoffs of\r\npolite society, and then thrilled the soul of mankind with utterances of\r\nwonderful beauty and grandeur; who, in his heart the best friend of the\r\ndefeated South, was murdered because a crazy fanatic took him for its\r\nmost cruel enemy; who, while in power, was beyond measure lampooned and\r\nmaligned by sectional passion and an excited party spirit, and around\r\nwhose bier friend and foe gathered to praise him which they have since\r\nnever ceased to do--as one of the greatest of Americans and the best of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN, BY JOSEPH H. CHOATE\r\n\r\n[This Address was delivered before the Edinburgh Philosophical\r\nInstitution, November 13, 1900. It is included in this set with the\r\ncourteous permission of the author and of Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell &\r\nCompany.]\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWhen you asked me to deliver the Inaugural Address on this occasion,\r\nI recognized that I owed this compliment to the fact that I was the\r\nofficial representative of America, and in selecting a subject I\r\nventured to think that I might interest you for an hour in a brief study\r\nin popular government, as illustrated by the life of the most American\r\nof all Americans. I therefore offer no apology for asking your attention\r\nto Abraham Lincoln--to his unique character and the part he bore in\r\ntwo important achievements of modern history: the preservation of the\r\nintegrity of the American Union and the emancipation of the colored\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nDuring his brief term of power he was probably the object of more abuse,\r\nvilification, and ridicule than any other man in the world; but when he\r\nfell by the hand of an assassin, at the very moment of his stupendous\r\nvictory, all the nations of the earth vied with one another in paying\r\nhomage to his character, and the thirty-five years that have since\r\nelapsed have established his place in history as one of the great\r\nbenefactors not of his own country alone, but of the human race.\r\n\r\nOne of many noble utterances upon the occasion of his death was that in\r\nwhich 'Punch' made its magnanimous recantation of the spirit with which\r\nit had pursued him:\r\n\r\n  \"Beside this corpse that bears for winding sheet\r\n   The stars and stripes he lived to rear anew,\r\n   Between the mourners at his head and feet,\r\n   Say, scurrile jester, is there room for you?\r\n\r\n          ...................\r\n\r\n  \"Yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer,\r\n   To lame my pencil, and confute my pen\r\n   To make me own this hind--of princes peer,\r\n   This rail-splitter--a true born king of men.\"\r\n\r\nFiction can furnish no match for the romance of his life, and biography\r\nwill be searched in vain for such startling vicissitudes of fortune,\r\nso great power and glory won out of such humble beginnings and adverse\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nDoubtless you are all familiar with the salient points of his\r\nextraordinary career. In the zenith of his fame he was the wise,\r\npatient, courageous, successful ruler of men; exercising more power than\r\nany monarch of his time, not for himself, but for the good of the people\r\nwho had placed it in his hands; commander-in-chief of a vast military\r\npower, which waged with ultimate success the greatest war of the\r\ncentury; the triumphant champion of popular government, the deliverer\r\nof four millions of his fellowmen from bondage; honored by mankind as\r\nStatesman, President, and Liberator.\r\n\r\nLet us glance now at the first half of the brief life of which this was\r\nthe glorious and happy consummation. Nothing could be more squalid and\r\nmiserable than the home in which Abraham Lincoln was born--a one-roomed\r\ncabin without floor or window in what was then the wilderness of\r\nKentucky, in the heart of that frontier life which swiftly moved\r\nwestward from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi, always in advance of\r\nschools and churches, of books and money, of railroads and newspapers,\r\nof all things which are generally regarded as the comforts and even\r\nnecessaries of life. His father, ignorant, needy, and thriftless,\r\ncontent if he could keep soul and body together for himself and his\r\nfamily, was ever seeking, without success, to better his unhappy\r\ncondition by moving on from one such scene of dreary desolation to\r\nanother. The rude society which surrounded them was not much better. The\r\nstruggle for existence was hard, and absorbed all their energies. They\r\nwere fighting the forest, the wild beast, and the retreating savage.\r\nFrom the time when he could barely handle tools until he attained his\r\nmajority, Lincoln's life was that of a simple farm laborer, poorly clad,\r\nhoused, and fed, at work either on his father's wretched farm or hired\r\nout to neighboring farmers. But in spite, or perhaps by means, of this\r\nrude environment, he grew to be a stalwart giant, reaching six feet four\r\nat nineteen, and fabulous stories are told of his feats of strength.\r\nWith the growth of this mighty frame began that strange education which\r\nin his ripening years was to qualify him for the great destiny that\r\nawaited him, and the development of those mental faculties and moral\r\nendowments which, by the time he reached middle life, were to make him\r\nthe sagacious, patient, and triumphant leader of a great nation in the\r\ncrisis of its fate. His whole schooling, obtained during such odd times\r\nas could be spared from grinding labor, did not amount in all to as much\r\nas one year, and the quality of the teaching was of the lowest possible\r\ngrade, including only the elements of reading, writing, and ciphering.\r\nBut out of these simple elements, when rightly used by the right man,\r\neducation is achieved, and Lincoln knew how to use them. As so often\r\nhappens, he seemed to take warning from his father's unfortunate\r\nexample. Untiring industry, an insatiable thirst for knowledge, and\r\nan ever-growing desire to rise above his surroundings, were early\r\nmanifestations of his character.\r\n\r\nBooks were almost unknown in that community, but the Bible was in\r\nevery house, and somehow or other Pilgrim's Progress, AEsop's Fables,\r\na History of the United States, and a Life of Washington fell into his\r\nhands. He trudged on foot many miles through the wilderness to borrow an\r\nEnglish Grammar, and is said to have devoured greedily the contents of\r\nthe Statutes of Indiana that fell in his way. These few volumes he read\r\nand reread--and his power of assimilation was great. To be shut in with\r\na few books and to master them thoroughly sometimes does more for the\r\ndevelopment of character than freedom to range at large, in a cursory\r\nand indiscriminate way, through wide domains of literature. This youth's\r\nmind, at any rate, was thoroughly saturated with Biblical knowledge and\r\nBiblical language, which, in after life, he used with great readiness\r\nand effect. But it was the constant use of the little knowledge which he\r\nhad that developed and exercised his mental powers. After the hard\r\nday's work was done, while others slept, he toiled on, always reading or\r\nwriting. From an early age he did his own thinking and made up his own\r\nmind--invaluable traits in the future President. Paper was such a scarce\r\ncommodity that, by the evening firelight, he would write and cipher\r\non the back of a wooden shovel, and then shave it off to make room for\r\nmore. By and by, as he approached manhood, he began speaking in the rude\r\ngatherings of the neighborhood, and so laid the foundation of that art\r\nof persuading his fellow-men which was one rich result of his education,\r\nand one great secret of his subsequent success.\r\n\r\nAccustomed as we are in these days of steam and telegraphs to have every\r\nintelligent boy survey the whole world each morning before breakfast,\r\nand inform himself as to what is going on in every nation, it is hardly\r\npossible to conceive how benighted and isolated was the condition of the\r\ncommunity at Pigeon Creek in Indiana, of which the family of Lincoln's\r\nfather formed a part, or how eagerly an ambitious and high-spirited boy,\r\nsuch as he, must have yearned to escape. The first glimpse that he ever\r\ngot of any world beyond the narrow confines of his home was in 1828, at\r\nthe age of nineteen, when a neighbor employed him to accompany his son\r\ndown the river to New Orleans to dispose of a flatboat of produce--a\r\ncommission which he discharged with great success.\r\n\r\nShortly after his return from this his first excursion into the outer\r\nworld, his father, tired of failure in Indiana, packed his family and\r\nall his worldly goods into a single wagon drawn by two yoke of oxen, and\r\nafter a fourteen days' tramp through the wilderness, pitched his camp\r\nonce more, in Illinois. Here Abraham, having come of age and being now\r\nhis own master, rendered the last service of his minority by ploughing\r\nthe fifteen-acre lot and splitting from the tall walnut trees of the\r\nprimeval forest enough rails to surround the little clearing with a\r\nfence. Such was the meagre outfit of this coming leader of men, at the\r\nage when the future British Prime Minister or statesman emerges from the\r\nuniversity as a double first or senior wrangler, with every advantage\r\nthat high training and broad culture and association with the wisest and\r\nthe best of men and women can give, and enters upon some form of public\r\nservice on the road to usefulness and honor, the University course being\r\nonly the first stage of the public training. So Lincoln, at twenty-one,\r\nhad just begun his preparation for the public life to which he soon\r\nbegan to aspire. For some years yet he must continue to earn his daily\r\nbread by the sweat of his brow, having absolutely no means, no home,\r\nno friend to consult. More farm work as a hired hand, a clerkship in a\r\nvillage store, the running of a mill, another trip to New Orleans on a\r\nflatboat of his own contriving, a pilot's berth on the river--these were\r\nthe means by which he subsisted until, in the summer of 1832, when he\r\nwas twenty-three years of age, an event occurred which gave him public\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hawk war broke out, and, the Governor of Illinois calling for\r\nvolunteers to repel the band of savages whose leader bore that name,\r\nLincoln enlisted and was elected captain by his comrades, among whom he\r\nhad already established his supremacy by signal feats of strength and\r\nmore than one successful single combat. During the brief hostilities\r\nhe was engaged in no battle and won no military glory, but his local\r\nleadership was established. The same year he offered himself as a\r\ncandidate for the Legislature of Illinois, but failed at the polls. Yet\r\nhis vast popularity with those who knew him was manifest. The district\r\nconsisted of several counties, but the unanimous vote of the people\r\nof his own county was for Lincoln. Another unsuccessful attempt at\r\nstore-keeping was followed by better luck at surveying, until his horse\r\nand instruments were levied upon under execution for the debts of his\r\nbusiness adventure.\r\n\r\nI have been thus detailed in sketching his early years because upon\r\nthese strange foundations the structure of his great fame and service\r\nwas built. In the place of a school and university training fortune\r\nsubstituted these trials, hardships, and struggles as a preparation for\r\nthe great work which he had to do. It turned out to be exactly what\r\nthe emergency required. Ten years instead at the public school and the\r\nuniversity certainly never could have fitted this man for the unique\r\nwork which was to be thrown upon him. Some other Moses would have had to\r\nlead us to our Jordan, to the sight of our promised land of liberty.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-five he became a member of the Legislature of\r\nIllinois, and so continued for eight years, and, in the meantime,\r\nqualified himself by reading such law books as he could borrow at\r\nrandom--for he was too poor to buy any to be called to the Bar. For\r\nhis second quarter of a century--during which a single term in Congress\r\nintroduced him into the arena of national questions--he gave himself up\r\nto law and politics. In spite of his soaring ambition, his two years\r\nin Congress gave him no premonition of the great destiny that awaited\r\nhim,--and at its close, in 1849, we find him an unsuccessful applicant\r\nto the President for appointment as Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice--a purely administrative bureau; a fortunate escape for\r\nhimself and for his country. Year by year his knowledge and power, his\r\nexperience and reputation extended, and his mental faculties seemed to\r\ngrow by what they fed on. His power of persuasion, which had always been\r\nmarked, was developed to an extraordinary degree, now that he became\r\nengaged in congenial questions and subjects. Little by little he rose to\r\nprominence at the Bar, and became the most effective public speaker in\r\nthe West. Not that he possessed any of the graces of the orator; but his\r\nlogic was invincible, and his clearness and force of statement impressed\r\nupon his hearers the convictions of his honest mind, while his broad\r\nsympathies and sparkling and genial humor made him a universal favorite\r\nas far and as fast as his acquaintance extended.\r\n\r\nThese twenty years that elapsed from the time of his establishment as\r\na lawyer and legislator in Springfield, the new capital of Illinois,\r\nfurnished a fitting theatre for the development and display of his great\r\nfaculties, and, with his new and enlarged opportunities, he obviously\r\ngrew in mental stature in this second period of his career, as if\r\nto compensate for the absolute lack of advantages under which he had\r\nsuffered in youth. As his powers enlarged, his reputation extended,\r\nfor he was always before the people, felt a warm sympathy with all that\r\nconcerned them, took a zealous part in the discussion of every public\r\nquestion, and made his personal influence ever more widely and deeply\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nMy brethren of the legal profession will naturally ask me, how could\r\nthis rough backwoodsman, whose youth had been spent in the forest or\r\non the farm and the flatboat, without culture or training, education or\r\nstudy, by the random reading, on the wing, of a few miscellaneous law\r\nbooks, become a learned and accomplished lawyer? Well, he never did.\r\nHe never would have earned his salt as a 'Writer' for the 'Signet',\r\nnor have won a place as advocate in the Court of Session, where the\r\ntechnique of the profession has reached its highest perfection, and\r\ncenturies of learning and precedent are involved in the equipment of a\r\nlawyer. Dr. Holmes, when asked by an anxious young mother, \"When should\r\nthe education of a child begin?\" replied, \"Madam, at least two centuries\r\nbefore it is born!\" and so I am sure it is with the Scots lawyer.\r\n\r\nBut not so in Illinois in 1840. Between 1830 and 1880 its population\r\nincreased twenty-fold, and when Lincoln began practising law in\r\nSpringfield in 1837, life in Illinois was very crude and simple, and so\r\nwere the courts and the administration of justice. Books and libraries\r\nwere scarce. But the people loved justice, upheld the law, and followed\r\nthe courts, and soon found their favorites among the advocates. The\r\nfundamental principles of the common law, as set forth by Blackstone\r\nand Chitty, were not so difficult to acquire; and brains, common sense,\r\nforce of character, tenacity of purpose, ready wit and power of speech\r\ndid the rest, and supplied all the deficiencies of learning.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuits of those days were extremely simple, and the principles of\r\nnatural justice were mainly relied on to dispose of them at the Bar\r\nand on the Bench, without resort to technical learning. Railroads,\r\ncorporations absorbing the chief business of the community, combined\r\nand inherited wealth, with all the subtle and intricate questions they\r\nbreed, had not yet come in--and so the professional agents and the\r\nequipment which they require were not needed. But there were many highly\r\neducated and powerful men at the Bar of Illinois, even in those early\r\ndays, whom the spirit of enterprise had carried there in search of fame\r\nand fortune. It was by constant contact and conflict with these that\r\nLincoln acquired professional strength and skill. Every community and\r\nevery age creates its own Bar, entirely adequate for its present uses\r\nand necessities. So in Illinois, as the population and wealth of the\r\nState kept on doubling and quadrupling, its Bar presented a growing\r\nabundance of learning and science and technical skill. The early\r\npractitioners grew with its growth and mastered the requisite knowledge.\r\nChicago soon grew to be one of the largest and richest and certainly\r\nthe most intensely active city on the continent, and if any of my\r\nprofessional friends here had gone there in Lincoln's later years, to\r\ntry or argue a cause, or transact other business, with any idea that\r\nEdinburgh or London had a monopoly of legal learning, science, or\r\nsubtlety, they would certainly have found their mistake.\r\n\r\nIn those early days in the West, every lawyer, especially every court\r\nlawyer, was necessarily a politician, constantly engaged in the public\r\ndiscussion of the many questions evolved from the rapid development\r\nof town, county, State, and Federal affairs. Then and there, in this\r\nregard, public discussion supplied the place which the universal\r\nactivity of the press has since monopolized, and the public speaker who,\r\nby clearness, force, earnestness, and wit; could make himself felt on\r\nthe questions of the day would rapidly come to the front. In the absence\r\nof that immense variety of popular entertainments which now feed the\r\npublic taste and appetite, the people found their chief amusement in\r\nfrequenting the courts and public and political assemblies. In either\r\nplace, he who impressed, entertained, and amused them most was the\r\nhero of the hour. They did not discriminate very carefully between the\r\neloquence of the forum and the eloquence of the hustings. Human nature\r\nruled in both alike, and he who was the most effective speaker in a\r\npolitical harangue was often retained as most likely to win in a cause\r\nto be tried or argued. And I have no doubt in this way many retainers\r\ncame to Lincoln. Fees, money in any form, had no charms for him--in\r\nhis eager pursuit of fame he could not afford to make money. He was\r\nambitious to distinguish himself by some great service to mankind, and\r\nthis ambition for fame and real public service left no room for avarice\r\nin his composition. However much he earned, he seems to have ended every\r\nyear hardly richer than he began it, and yet, as the years passed,\r\nfees came to him freely. One of L 1,000 is recorded--a very large\r\nprofessional fee at that time, even in any part of America, the paradise\r\nof lawyers. I lay great stress on Lincoln's career as a lawyer--much\r\nmore than his biographers do because in America a state of things\r\nexists wholly different from that which prevails in Great Britain. The\r\nprofession of the law always has been and is to this day the principal\r\navenue to public life; and I am sure that his training and experience\r\nin the courts had much to do with the development of those forces of\r\nintellect and character which he soon displayed on a broader arena.\r\n\r\nIt was in political controversy, of course, that he acquired his wide\r\nreputation, and made his deep and lasting impression upon the people of\r\nwhat had now become the powerful State of Illinois, and upon the people\r\nof the Great West, to whom the political power and control of the United\r\nStates were already surely and swiftly passing from the older Eastern\r\nStates. It was this reputation and this impression, and the familiar\r\nknowledge of his character which had come to them from his local\r\nleadership, that happily inspired the people of the West to present him\r\nas their candidate, and to press him upon the Republican convention of\r\n1860 as the fit and necessary leader in the struggle for life which was\r\nbefore the nation.\r\n\r\nThat struggle, as you all know, arose out of the terrible question of\r\nslavery--and I must trust to your general knowledge of the history\r\nof that question to make intelligible the attitude and leadership of\r\nLincoln as the champion of the hosts of freedom in the final contest.\r\nNegro slavery had been firmly established in the Southern States from\r\nan early period of their history. In 1619, the year before the Mayflower\r\nlanded our Pilgrim Fathers upon Plymouth Rock, a Dutch ship had\r\ndischarged a cargo of African slaves at Jamestown in Virginia: All\r\nthrough the colonial period their importation had continued. A few had\r\nfound their way into the Northern States, but none of them in sufficient\r\nnumbers to constitute danger or to afford a basis for political power.\r\nAt the time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution, there is no\r\ndoubt that the principal members of the convention not only condemned\r\nslavery as a moral, social, and political evil, but believed that by\r\nthe suppression of the slave trade it was in the course of gradual\r\nextinction in the South, as it certainly was in the North. Washington,\r\nin his will, provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, and\r\nsaid to Jefferson that it \"was among his first wishes to see some plan\r\nadopted by which slavery in his country might be abolished.\" Jefferson\r\nsaid, referring to the institution: \"I tremble for my country when I\r\nthink that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever,\"--and\r\nFranklin, Adams, Hamilton, and Patrick Henry were all utterly opposed\r\nto it. But it was made the subject of a fatal compromise in the Federal\r\nConstitution, whereby its existence was recognized in the States as a\r\nbasis of representation, the prohibition of the importation of slaves\r\nwas postponed for twenty years, and the return of fugitive slaves\r\nprovided for. But no imminent danger was apprehended from it till, by\r\nthe invention of the cotton gin in 1792, cotton culture by negro labor\r\nbecame at once and forever the leading industry of the South, and gave\r\na new impetus to the importation of slaves, so that in 1808, when\r\nthe constitutional prohibition took effect, their numbers had vastly\r\nincreased. From that time forward slavery became the basis of a great\r\npolitical power, and the Southern States, under all circumstances and at\r\nevery opportunity, carried on a brave and unrelenting struggle for its\r\nmaintenance and extension.\r\n\r\nThe conscience of the North was slow to rise against it, though bitter\r\ncontroversies from time to time took place. The Southern leaders\r\nthreatened disunion if their demands were not complied with. To save the\r\nUnion, compromise after compromise was made, but each one in the end was\r\nbroken. The Missouri Compromise, made in 1820 upon the occasion of\r\nthe admission of Missouri into the Union as a slave State, whereby, in\r\nconsideration of such admission, slavery was forever excluded from the\r\nNorthwest Territory, was ruthlessly repealed in 1854, by a Congress\r\nelected in the interests of the slave power, the intent being to force\r\nslavery into that vast territory which had so long been dedicated to\r\nfreedom. This challenge at last aroused the slumbering conscience and\r\npassion of the North, and led to the formation of the Republican party\r\nfor the avowed purpose of preventing, by constitutional methods, the\r\nfurther extension of slavery.\r\n\r\nIn its first campaign, in 1856, though it failed to elect its\r\ncandidates; it received a surprising vote and carried many of the\r\nStates. No one could any longer doubt that the North had made up its\r\nmind that no threats of disunion should deter it from pressing its\r\ncherished purpose and performing its long neglected duty. From the\r\noutset, Lincoln was one of the most active and effective leaders and\r\nspeakers of the new party, and the great debates between Lincoln and\r\nDouglas in 1858, as the respective champions of the restriction and\r\nextension of slavery, attracted the attention of the whole country.\r\nLincoln's powerful arguments carried conviction everywhere. His moral\r\nnature was thoroughly aroused his conscience was stirred to the quick.\r\nUnless slavery was wrong, nothing was wrong. Was each man, of whatever\r\ncolor, entitled to the fruits of his own labor, or could one man live\r\nin idle luxury by the sweat of another's brow, whose skin was darker?\r\nHe was an implicit believer in that principle of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence that all men are vested with certain inalienable rights\r\nthe equal rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On this\r\ndoctrine he staked his case and carried it. We have time only for one or\r\ntwo sentences in which he struck the keynote of the contest.\r\n\r\n\"The real issue in this country is the eternal struggle between these\r\ntwo principles--right and wrong--throughout the world. They are the two\r\nprinciples that have stood face to face from the beginning of time, and\r\nwill ever continue to struggle. The one is the common right of humanity,\r\nand the other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle in\r\nwhatever shape it develops itself. It is the same spirit that says, 'You\r\nwork and toil and earn bread and I'll eat it.'\"\r\n\r\nHe foresaw with unerring vision that the conflict was inevitable and\r\nirrepressible--that one or the other, the right or the wrong, freedom\r\nor slavery, must ultimately prevail and wholly prevail, throughout the\r\ncountry; and this was the principle that carried the war, once begun, to\r\na finish.\r\n\r\nOne sentence of his is immortal:\r\n\r\n\"Under the operation of the policy of compromise, the slavery agitation\r\nhas not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion\r\nit will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A\r\nhouse divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this government\r\ncannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect\r\nthe Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall, but I do\r\nexpect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or\r\nall the other; either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further\r\nspread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the\r\nbelief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates\r\nwill push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the\r\nStates, old as well as new, North as well as South.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the entire decade from 1850 to 1860 the agitation of the\r\nslavery question was at the boiling point, and events which have become\r\nhistorical continually indicated the near approach of the overwhelming\r\nstorm. No sooner had the Compromise Acts of 1850 resulted in a temporary\r\npeace, which everybody said must be final and perpetual, than new\r\noutbreaks came. The forcible carrying away of fugitive slaves by Federal\r\ntroops from Boston agitated that ancient stronghold of freedom to its\r\nfoundations. The publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin, which truly exposed\r\nthe frightful possibilities of the slave system; the reckless attempts\r\nby force and fraud to establish it in Kansas against the will of the\r\nvast majority of the settlers; the beating of Summer in the Senate\r\nChamber for words spoken in debate; the Dred Scott decision in the\r\nSupreme Court, which made the nation realize that the slave power had at\r\nlast reached the fountain of Federal justice; and finally the execution\r\nof John Brown, for his wild raid into Virginia, to invite the slaves to\r\nrally to the standard of freedom which he unfurled:--all these events\r\ntend to illustrate and confirm Lincoln's contention that the nation\r\ncould not permanently continue half slave and half free, but must become\r\nall one thing or all the other. When John Brown lay under sentence of\r\ndeath he declared that now he was sure that slavery must be wiped out in\r\nblood; but neither he nor his executioners dreamt that within four years\r\na million soldiers would be marching across the country for its final\r\nextirpation, to the music of the war-song of the great conflict:\r\n\r\n   \"John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave,\r\n   But his soul is marching on.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, at the age of fifty-one, this child of the wilderness, this\r\nfarm laborer, rail-sputter, flatboatman, this surveyor, lawyer, orator,\r\nstatesman, and patriot, found himself elected by the great party which\r\nwas pledged to prevent at all hazards the further extension of slavery,\r\nas the chief magistrate of the Republic, bound to carry out that\r\npurpose, to be the leader and ruler of the nation in its most trying\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThose who believe that there is a living Providence that overrules and\r\nconducts the affairs of nations, find in the elevation of this plain man\r\nto this extraordinary fortune and to this great duty, which he so\r\nfitly discharged, a signal vindication of their faith. Perhaps to this\r\nphilosophical institution the judgment of our philosopher Emerson will\r\ncommend itself as a just estimate of Lincoln's historical place.\r\n\r\n\"His occupying the chair of state was a triumph of the good sense of\r\nmankind and of the public conscience. He grew according to the need; his\r\nmind mastered the problem of the day: and as the problem grew, so did\r\nhis comprehension of it. In the war there was no place for holiday\r\nmagistrate, nor fair-weather sailor. The new pilot was hurried to\r\nthe helm in a tornado. In four years--four years of battle days--his\r\nendurance, his fertility of resource, his magnanimity, were sorely\r\ntried, and never found wanting. There, by his courage, his justice, his\r\neven temper, his fertile counsel, his humanity, he stood a heroic figure\r\nin the centre of a heroic epoch. He is the true history of the American\r\npeople in his time, the true representative of this continent--father\r\nof his country, the pulse of twenty millions throbbing in his heart, the\r\nthought of their mind--articulated in his tongue.\"\r\n\r\nHe was born great, as distinguished from those who achieve greatness or\r\nhave it thrust upon them, and his inherent capacity, mental, moral, and\r\nphysical, having been recognized by the educated intelligence of a free\r\npeople, they happily chose him for their ruler in a day of deadly peril.\r\n\r\nIt is now forty years since I first saw and heard Abraham Lincoln, but\r\nthe impression which he left on my mind is ineffaceable. After his great\r\nsuccesses in the West he came to New York to make a political address.\r\nHe appeared in every sense of the word like one of the plain people\r\namong whom he loved to be counted. At first sight there was nothing\r\nimpressive or imposing about him--except that his great stature singled\r\nhim out from the crowd: his clothes hung awkwardly on his giant frame;\r\nhis face was of a dark pallor, without the slightest tinge of color; his\r\nseamed and rugged features bore the furrows of hardship and struggle;\r\nhis deep-set eyes looked sad and anxious; his countenance in repose gave\r\nlittle evidence of that brain power which had raised him from the lowest\r\nto the highest station among his countrymen; as he talked to me before\r\nthe meeting, he seemed ill at ease, with that sort of apprehension which\r\na young man might feel before presenting himself to a new and strange\r\naudience, whose critical disposition he dreaded. It was a great\r\naudience, including all the noted men--all the learned and cultured of\r\nhis party in New York editors, clergymen, statesmen, lawyers, merchants,\r\ncritics. They were all very curious to hear him. His fame as a powerful\r\nspeaker had preceded him, and exaggerated rumor of his wit--the worst\r\nforerunner of an orator--had reached the East. When Mr. Bryant presented\r\nhim, on the high platform of the Cooper Institute, a vast sea of eager\r\nupturned faces greeted him, full of intense curiosity to see what this\r\nrude child of the people was like. He was equal to the occasion. When\r\nhe spoke he was transformed; his eye kindled, his voice rang, his face\r\nshone and seemed to light up the whole assembly. For an hour and a half\r\nhe held his audience in the hollow of his hand. His style of speech and\r\nmanner of delivery were severely simple. What Lowell called \"the\r\ngrand simplicities of the Bible,\" with which he was so familiar, were\r\nreflected in his discourse. With no attempt at ornament or rhetoric,\r\nwithout parade or pretence, he spoke straight to the point. If any came\r\nexpecting the turgid eloquence or the ribaldry of the frontier, they\r\nmust have been startled at the earnest and sincere purity of his\r\nutterances. It was marvellous to see how this untutored man, by mere\r\nself-discipline and the chastening of his own spirit, had outgrown all\r\nmeretricious arts, and found his own way to the grandeur and strength of\r\nabsolute simplicity.\r\n\r\nHe spoke upon the theme which he had mastered so thoroughly. He\r\ndemonstrated by copious historical proofs and masterly logic that the\r\nfathers who created the Constitution in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion, to establish justice, and to secure the blessings of liberty\r\nto themselves and their posterity, intended to empower the Federal\r\nGovernment to exclude slavery from the Territories. In the kindliest\r\nspirit he protested against the avowed threat of the Southern States to\r\ndestroy the Union if, in order to secure freedom in those vast regions\r\nout of which future States were to be carved, a Republican President\r\nwere elected. He closed with an appeal to his audience, spoken with all\r\nthe fire of his aroused and kindling conscience, with a full outpouring\r\nof his love of justice and liberty, to maintain their political purpose\r\non that lofty and unassailable issue of right and wrong which alone\r\ncould justify it, and not to be intimidated from their high resolve and\r\nsacred duty by any threats of destruction to the government or of ruin\r\nto themselves. He concluded with this telling sentence, which drove the\r\nwhole argument home to all our hearts: \"Let us have faith that right\r\nmakes might, and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as\r\nwe understand it.\" That night the great hall, and the next day the whole\r\ncity, rang with delighted applause and congratulations, and he who had\r\ncome as a stranger departed with the laurels of great triumph.\r\n\r\nAlas! in five years from that exulting night I saw him again, for the\r\nlast time, in the same city, borne in his coffin through its draped\r\nstreets. With tears and lamentations a heart-broken people accompanied\r\nhim from Washington, the scene of his martyrdom, to his last\r\nresting-place in the young city of the West where he had worked his way\r\nto fame.\r\n\r\nNever was a new ruler in a more desperate plight than Lincoln when\r\nhe entered office on the fourth of March, 1861, four months after his\r\nelection, and took his oath to support the Constitution and the Union.\r\nThe intervening time had been busily employed by the Southern States in\r\ncarrying out their threat of disunion in the event of his election.\r\nAs soon as the fact was ascertained, seven of them had seceded and had\r\nseized upon the forts, arsenals, navy yards, and other public property\r\nof the United States within their boundaries, and were making every\r\npreparation for war. In the meantime the retiring President, who had\r\nbeen elected by the slave power, and who thought the seceding States\r\ncould not lawfully be coerced, had done absolutely nothing. Lincoln\r\nfound himself, by the Constitution, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and\r\nNavy of the United States, but with only a remnant of either at hand.\r\nEach was to be created on a great scale out of the unknown resources of\r\na nation untried in war.\r\n\r\nIn his mild and conciliatory inaugural address, while appealing to the\r\nseceding States to return to their allegiance, he avowed his purpose to\r\nkeep the solemn oath he had taken that day, to see that the laws of the\r\nUnion were faithfully executed, and to use the troops to recover the\r\nforts, navy yards, and other property belonging to the government. It\r\nis probable, however, that neither side actually realized that war\r\nwas inevitable, and that the other was determined to fight, until the\r\nassault on Fort Sumter presented the South as the first aggressor\r\nand roused the North to use every possible resource to maintain the\r\ngovernment and the imperilled Union, and to vindicate the supremacy of\r\nthe flag over every inch of the territory of the United States. The\r\nfact that Lincoln's first proclamation called for only 75,000 troops, to\r\nserve for three months, shows how inadequate was even his idea of what\r\nthe future had in store. But from that moment Lincoln and his loyal\r\nsupporters never faltered in their purpose. They knew they could win,\r\nthat it was their duty to win, and that for America the whole hope\r\nof the future depended upon their winning; for now by the acts of the\r\nseceding States the issue of the election to secure or prevent the\r\nextension of slavery--stood transformed into a struggle to preserve or\r\nto destroy the Union.\r\n\r\nWe cannot follow this contest. You know its gigantic proportions; that\r\nit lasted four years instead of three months; that in its progress,\r\ninstead of 75,000 men, more than 2,000,000 were enrolled on the side\r\nof the government alone; that the aggregate cost and loss to the nation\r\napproximated to 1,000,000,000 pounds sterling, and that not less than\r\n300,000 brave and precious lives were sacrificed on each side. History\r\nhas recorded how Lincoln bore himself during these four frightful years;\r\nthat he was the real President, the responsible and actual head of the\r\ngovernment, through it all; that he listened to all advice, heard all\r\nparties, and then, always realizing his responsibility to God and the\r\nnation, decided every great executive question for himself. His absolute\r\nhonesty had become proverbial long before he was President. \"Honest Abe\r\nLincoln\" was the name by which he had been known for years. His every\r\nact attested it.\r\n\r\nIn all the grandeur of the vast power that he wielded, he never ceased\r\nto be one of the plain people, as he always called them, never lost or\r\nimpaired his perfect sympathy with them, was always in perfect touch\r\nwith them and open to their appeals; and here lay the very secret of\r\nhis personality and of his power, for the people in turn gave him their\r\nabsolute confidence. His courage, his fortitude, his patience, his\r\nhopefulness, were sorely tried but never exhausted.\r\n\r\nHe was true as steel to his generals, but had frequent occasion to\r\nchange them, as he found them inadequate. This serious and painful duty\r\nrested wholly upon him, and was perhaps his most important function as\r\nCommander-in-Chief; but when, at last, he recognized in General Grant\r\nthe master of the situation, the man who could and would bring the war\r\nto a triumphant end, he gave it all over to him and upheld him with all\r\nhis might. Amid all the pressure and distress that the burdens of office\r\nbrought upon him, his unfailing sense of humor saved him; probably it\r\nmade it possible for him to live under the burden. He had always been\r\nthe great story-teller of the West, and he used and cultivated this\r\nfaculty to relieve the weight of the load he bore.\r\n\r\nIt enabled him to keep the wonderful record of never having lost his\r\ntemper, no matter what agony he had to bear. A whole night might be\r\nspent in recounting the stories of his wit, humor, and harmless sarcasm.\r\nBut I will recall only two of his sayings, both about General Grant, who\r\nalways found plenty of enemies and critics to urge the President to oust\r\nhim from his command. One, I am sure, will interest all Scotchmen. They\r\nrepeated with malicious intent the gossip that Grant drank. \"What\r\ndoes he drink?\" asked Lincoln. \"Whiskey,\" was, of course, the answer;\r\ndoubtless you can guess the brand. \"Well,\" said the President, \"just\r\nfind out what particular kind he uses and I'll send a barrel to each of\r\nmy other generals.\" The other must be as pleasing to the British as\r\nto the American ear. When pressed again on other grounds to get rid of\r\nGrant, he declared, \"I can't spare that man, he fights!\"\r\n\r\nHe was tender-hearted to a fault, and never could resist the appeals of\r\nwives and mothers of soldiers who had got into trouble and were under\r\nsentence of death for their offences. His Secretary of War and other\r\nofficials complained that they never could get deserters shot. As surely\r\nas the women of the culprit's family could get at him he always gave\r\nway. Certainly you will all appreciate his exquisite sympathy with the\r\nsuffering relatives of those who had fallen in battle. His heart bled\r\nwith theirs. Never was there a more gentle and tender utterance than his\r\nletter to a mother who had given all her sons to her country, written at\r\na time when the angel of death had visited almost every household in the\r\nland, and was already hovering over him.\r\n\r\n\"I have been shown,\" he says, \"in the files of the War Department a\r\nstatement that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously\r\non the field of battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words\r\nof mine which should attempt to beguile you from your grief for a\r\nloss so overwhelming but I cannot refrain from tendering to you the\r\nconsolation which may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died\r\nto save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your\r\nbereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and the\r\nlost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a\r\nsacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nHardly could your illustrious sovereign, from the depths of her queenly\r\nand womanly heart, have spoken words more touching and tender to soothe\r\nthe stricken mothers of her own soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation, with which Mr. Lincoln delighted the\r\ncountry and the world on the first of January, 1863, will doubtless\r\nsecure for him a foremost place in history among the philanthropists\r\nand benefactors of the race, as it rescued, from hopeless and degrading\r\nslavery, so many millions of his fellow-beings described in the law and\r\nexisting in fact as \"chattels-personal, in the hands of their owners\r\nand possessors, to all intents, constructions, and purposes whatsoever.\"\r\nRarely does the happy fortune come to one man to render such a service\r\nto his kind--to proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the\r\ninhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\nIdeas rule the world, and never was there a more signal instance of this\r\ntriumph of an idea than here. William Lloyd Garrison, who thirty years\r\nbefore had begun his crusade for the abolition of slavery, and had lived\r\nto see this glorious and unexpected consummation of the hopeless cause\r\nto which he had devoted his life, well described the proclamation as\r\na \"great historic event, sublime in its magnitude, momentous and\r\nbeneficent in its far-reaching consequences, and eminently just and\r\nright alike to the oppressor and the oppressed.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln had always been heart and soul opposed to slavery. Tradition\r\nsays that on the trip on the flatboat to New Orleans he formed his\r\nfirst and last opinion of slavery at the sight of negroes chained and\r\nscourged, and that then and there the iron entered into his soul. No\r\nboy could grow to manhood in those days as a poor white in Kentucky and\r\nIndiana, in close contact with slavery or in its neighborhood, without a\r\ngrowing consciousness of its blighting effects on free labor, as well as\r\nof its frightful injustice and cruelty. In the Legislature of Illinois,\r\nwhere the public sentiment was all for upholding the institution and\r\nviolently against every movement for its abolition or restriction, upon\r\nthe passage of resolutions to that effect he had the courage with one\r\ncompanion to put on record his protest, \"believing that the institution\r\nof slavery is founded both in injustice and bad policy.\" No great\r\ndemonstration of courage, you will say; but that was at a time when\r\nGarrison, for his abolition utterances, had been dragged by an angry mob\r\nthrough the streets of Boston with a rope around his body, and in\r\nthe very year that Lovejoy in the same State of Illinois was slain by\r\nrioters while defending his press, from which he had printed antislavery\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\nIn Congress he brought in a bill for gradual abolition in the District\r\nof Columbia, with compensation to the owners, for until they raised\r\ntreasonable hands against the life of the nation he always maintained\r\nthat the property of the slaveholders, into which they had come by two\r\ncenturies of descent, without fault on their part, ought not to be taken\r\naway from them without just compensation. He used to say that, one way\r\nor another, he had voted forty-two times for the Wilmot Proviso, which\r\nMr. Wilmot of Pennsylvania moved as an addition to every bill which\r\naffected United States territory, \"that neither slavery nor involuntary\r\nservitude shall ever exist in any part of the said territory,\" and it is\r\nevident that his condemnation of the system, on moral grounds as a crime\r\nagainst the human race, and on political grounds as a cancer that was\r\nsapping the vitals of the nation, and must master its whole being or\r\nbe itself extirpated, grew steadily upon him until it culminated in his\r\ngreat speeches in the Illinois debate.\r\n\r\nBy the mere election of Lincoln to the Presidency, the further extension\r\nof slavery into the Territories was rendered forever impossible--Vox\r\npopuli, vox Dei. Revolutions never go backward, and when founded on a\r\ngreat moral sentiment stirring the heart of an indignant people their\r\nedicts are irresistible and final. Had the slave power acquiesced in\r\nthat election, had the Southern States remained under the Constitution\r\nand within the Union, and relied upon their constitutional and legal\r\nrights, their favorite institution, immoral as it was, blighting and\r\nfatal as it was, might have endured for another century. The great party\r\nthat had elected him, unalterably determined against its extension, was\r\nnevertheless pledged not to interfere with its continuance in the States\r\nwhere it already existed. Of course, when new regions were forever\r\nclosed against it, from its very nature it must have begun to shrink\r\nand to dwindle; and probably gradual and compensated emancipation,\r\nwhich appealed very strongly to the new President's sense of justice and\r\nexpediency, would, in the progress of time, by a reversion to the ideas\r\nof the founders of the Republic, have found a safe outlet for both\r\nmasters and slaves. But whom the gods wish to destroy they first make\r\nmad, and when seven States, afterwards increased to eleven, openly\r\nseceded from the Union, when they declared and began the war upon the\r\nnation, and challenged its mighty power to the desperate and protracted\r\nstruggle for its life, and for the maintenance of its authority as\r\na nation over its territory, they gave to Lincoln and to freedom the\r\nsublime opportunity of history.\r\n\r\nIn his first inaugural address, when as yet not a drop of precious blood\r\nhad been shed, while he held out to them the olive branch in one hand,\r\nin the other he presented the guarantees of the Constitution, and after\r\nreciting the emphatic resolution of the convention that nominated\r\nhim, that the maintenance inviolate of the \"rights of the States, and\r\nespecially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic\r\ninstitutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential\r\nto that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our\r\npolitical fabric depend,\" he reiterated this sentiment, and declared,\r\nwith no mental reservation, \"that all the protection which, consistently\r\nwith the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully\r\ngiven to all the States when lawfully demanded for whatever cause as\r\ncheerfully to one section as to another.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, however, these magnanimous overtures for peace and reunion were\r\nrejected; when the seceding States defied the Constitution and every\r\nclause and principle of it; when they persisted in staying out of the\r\nUnion from which they had seceded, and proceeded to carve out of its\r\nterritory a new and hostile empire based on slavery; when they flew at\r\nthe throat of the nation and plunged it into the bloodiest war of the\r\nnineteenth century the tables were turned, and the belief gradually came\r\nto the mind of the President that if the Rebellion was not soon subdued\r\nby force of arms, if the war must be fought out to the bitter end, then\r\nto reach that end the salvation of the nation itself might require\r\nthe destruction of slavery wherever it existed; that if the war was to\r\ncontinue on one side for Disunion, for no other purpose than to preserve\r\nslavery, it must continue on the other side for the Union, to destroy\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nAs he said, \"Events control me; I cannot control events,\" and as the\r\ndreadful war progressed and became more deadly and dangerous, the\r\nunalterable conviction was forced upon him that, in order that the\r\nfrightful sacrifice of life and treasure on both sides might not be all\r\nin vain, it had become his duty as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, as\r\na necessary war measure, to strike a blow at the Rebellion which,\r\nall others failing, would inevitably lead to its annihilation, by\r\nannihilating the very thing for which it was contending. His own words\r\nare the best:\r\n\r\n\"I understood that my oath to preserve the Constitution to the best of\r\nmy ability imposed upon me the duty of preserving by every indispensable\r\nmeans that government--that nation--of which that Constitution was the\r\norganic law. Was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the\r\nConstitution? By general law, life and limb must be protected, yet often\r\na limb must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely\r\ngiven to save a limb. I felt that measures otherwise unconstitutional\r\nmight become lawful by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the\r\nConstitution through the preservation of the nation. Right or wrong, I\r\nassumed this ground and now avow it. I could not feel that to the best\r\nof my ability I had ever tried to preserve the Constitution if to save\r\nslavery or any minor matter I should permit the wreck of government,\r\ncountry, and Constitution all together.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, at last, when in his judgment the indispensable necessity had\r\ncome, he struck the fatal blow, and signed the proclamation which has\r\nmade his name immortal. By it, the President, as Commander-in-Chief in\r\ntime of actual armed rebellion, and as a fit and necessary war measure\r\nfor suppressing the rebellion, proclaimed all persons held as slaves\r\nin the States and parts of States then in rebellion to be thenceforward\r\nfree, and declared that the executive, with the army and navy, would\r\nrecognize and maintain their freedom.\r\n\r\nIn the other great steps of the government, which led to the triumphant\r\nprosecution of the war, he necessarily shared the responsibility and the\r\ncredit with the great statesmen who stayed up his hands in his cabinet,\r\nwith Seward, Chase and Stanton, and the rest,--and with his generals and\r\nadmirals, his soldiers and sailors, but this great act was absolutely\r\nhis own. The conception and execution were exclusively his. He laid it\r\nbefore his cabinet as a measure on which his mind was made up and could\r\nnot be changed, asking them only for suggestions as to details. He chose\r\nthe time and the circumstances under which the Emancipation should be\r\nproclaimed and when it should take effect.\r\n\r\nIt came not an hour too soon; but public opinion in the North would not\r\nhave sustained it earlier. In the first eighteen months of the war its\r\nravages had extended from the Atlantic to beyond the Mississippi. Many\r\nvictories in the West had been balanced and paralyzed by inaction\r\nand disasters in Virginia, only partially redeemed by the bloody and\r\nindecisive battle of Antietam; a reaction had set in from the general\r\nenthusiasm which had swept the Northern States after the assault upon\r\nSumter. It could not truly be said that they had lost heart, but faction\r\nwas raising its head. Heard through the land like the blast of a\r\nbugle, the proclamation rallied the patriotism of the country to fresh\r\nsacrifices and renewed ardor. It was a step that could not be revoked.\r\nIt relieved the conscience of the nation from an incubus that had\r\noppressed it from its birth. The United States were rescued from the\r\nfalse predicament in which they had been from the beginning, and the\r\ngreat popular heart leaped with new enthusiasm for \"Liberty and Union,\r\nhenceforth and forever, one and inseparable.\" It brought not only moral\r\nbut material support to the cause of the government, for within two\r\nyears 120,000 colored troops were enlisted in the military service and\r\nfollowing the national flag, supported by all the loyalty of the North,\r\nand led by its choicest spirits. One mother said, when her son was\r\noffered the command of the first colored regiment, \"If he accepts it\r\nI shall be as proud as if I had heard that he was shot.\" He was shot\r\nheading a gallant charge of his regiment.... The Confederates replied to\r\na request of his friends for his body that they had \"buried him under a\r\nlayer of his niggers...;\" but that mother has lived to enjoy thirty-six\r\nyears of his glory, and Boston has erected its noblest monument to his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the proclamation upon the actual progress of the war was\r\nnot immediate, but wherever the Federal armies advanced they carried\r\nfreedom with them, and when the summer came round the new spirit and\r\nforce which had animated the heart of the government and people were\r\nmanifest. In the first week of July the decisive battle of Gettysburg\r\nturned the tide of war, and the fall of Vicksburg made the great river\r\nfree from its source to the Gulf.\r\n\r\nOn foreign nations the influence of the proclamation and of these new\r\nvictories was of great importance. In those days, when there was no\r\ncable, it was not easy for foreign observers to appreciate what was\r\nreally going on; they could not see clearly the true state of affairs,\r\nas in the last year of the nineteenth century we have been able, by our\r\nnew electric vision, to watch every event at the antipodes and observe\r\nits effect. The Rebel emissaries, sent over to solicit intervention,\r\nspared no pains to impress upon the minds of public and private men\r\nand upon the press their own views of the character of the contest. The\r\nprospects of the Confederacy were always better abroad than at home. The\r\nstock markets of the world gambled upon its chances, and its bonds at\r\none time were high in favor.\r\n\r\nSuch ideas as these were seriously held: that the North was fighting for\r\nempire and the South for independence; that the Southern States, instead\r\nof being the grossest oligarchies, essentially despotisms, founded on\r\nthe right of one man to appropriate the fruit of other men's toil and to\r\nexclude them from equal rights, were real republics, feebler to be sure\r\nthan their Northern rivals, but representing the same idea of freedom,\r\nand that the mighty strength of the nation was being put forth to\r\ncrush them; that Jefferson Davis and the Southern leaders had created\r\na nation; that the republican experiment had failed and the Union had\r\nceased to exist. But the crowning argument to foreign minds was that\r\nit was an utter impossibility for the government to win in the contest;\r\nthat the success of the Southern States, so far as separation was\r\nconcerned, was as certain as any event yet future and contingent could\r\nbe; that the subjugation of the South by the North, even if it could be\r\naccomplished, would prove a calamity to the United States and the world,\r\nand especially calamitous to the negro race; and that such a victory\r\nwould necessarily leave the people of the South for many generations\r\ncherishing deadly hostility against the government and the North, and\r\nplotting always to recover their independence.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln issued his proclamation he knew that all these ideas were\r\nfounded in error; that the national resources were inexhaustible;\r\nthat the government could and would win, and that if slavery were once\r\nfinally disposed of, the only cause of difference being out of the way,\r\nthe North and South would come together again, and by and by be as good\r\nfriends as ever. In many quarters abroad the proclamation was\r\nwelcomed with enthusiasm by the friends of America; but I think the\r\ndemonstrations in its favor that brought more gladness to Lincoln's\r\nheart than any other were the meetings held in the manufacturing\r\ncentres, by the very operatives upon whom the war bore the hardest,\r\nexpressing the most enthusiastic sympathy with the proclamation, while\r\nthey bore with heroic fortitude the grievous privations which the war\r\nentailed upon them. Mr. Lincoln's expectation when he announced to the\r\nworld that all slaves in all States then in rebellion were set free\r\nmust have been that the avowed position of his government, that the\r\ncontinuance of the war now meant the annihilation of slavery, would make\r\nintervention impossible for any foreign nation whose people were lovers\r\nof liberty--and so the result proved.\r\n\r\nThe growth and development of Lincoln's mental power and moral force, of\r\nhis intense and magnetic personality, after the vast responsibilities of\r\ngovernment were thrown upon him at the age of fifty-two, furnish a rare\r\nand striking illustration of the marvellous capacity and adaptability of\r\nthe human intellect--of the sound mind in the sound body. He came to\r\nthe discharge of the great duties of the Presidency with absolutely no\r\nexperience in the administration of government, or of the vastly\r\nvaried and complicated questions of foreign and domestic policy which\r\nimmediately arose, and continued to press upon him during the rest of\r\nhis life; but he mastered each as it came, apparently with the facility\r\nof a trained and experienced ruler. As Clarendon said of Cromwell, \"His\r\nparts seemed to be raised by the demands of great station.\" His life\r\nthrough it all was one of intense labor, anxiety, and distress, without\r\none hour of peaceful repose from first to last. But he rose to every\r\noccasion. He led public opinion, but did not march so far in advance of\r\nit as to fail of its effective support in every great emergency. He\r\nknew the heart and thought of the people, as no man not in constant and\r\nabsolute sympathy with them could have known it, and so holding their\r\nconfidence, he triumphed through and with them. Not only was there this\r\nsteady growth of intellect, but the infinite delicacy of his nature and\r\nits capacity for refinement developed also, as exhibited in the\r\npurity and perfection of his language and style of speech. The rough\r\nbackwoodsman, who had never seen the inside of a university, became in\r\nthe end, by self-training and the exercise of his own powers of mind,\r\nheart, and soul, a master of style, and some of his utterances will rank\r\nwith the best, the most perfectly adapted to the occasion which produced\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHave you time to listen to his two-minutes speech at Gettysburg, at the\r\ndedication of the Soldiers' Cemetery? His whole soul was in it:\r\n\r\n\"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this\r\ncontinent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the\r\nproposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a\r\ngreat civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived\r\nand so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of\r\nthat war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final\r\nresting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might\r\nlive. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But\r\nin a larger sense we cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot\r\nhallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here\r\nhave consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The\r\nworld will little note, nor long remember, what we say here but it can\r\nnever forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to\r\nbe dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have\r\nthus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to\r\nthe great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we\r\ntake increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full\r\nmeasure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall\r\nnot have died in vain--that this nation under God shall have a new birth\r\nof freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, and for\r\nthe people shall not perish from the earth.\"\r\n\r\nHe lived to see his work indorsed by an overwhelming majority of his\r\ncountrymen. In his second inaugural address, pronounced just forty days\r\nbefore his death, there is a single passage which well displays his\r\nindomitable will and at the same time his deep religious feeling,\r\nhis sublime charity to the enemies of his country, and his broad and\r\ncatholic humanity:\r\n\r\n\"If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offences\r\nwhich in the Providence of God must needs come, but which, having\r\ncontinued through the appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that\r\nHe gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to\r\nthose by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any departure\r\nfrom those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always\r\nascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this\r\nmighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it\r\ncontinue until all the wealth piled by the bondsmen's two hundred and\r\nfifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of\r\nblood drawn with the lash shall be paid with another drawn by the sword,\r\nas was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, 'the\r\njudgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.'\r\n\r\n\"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the\r\nright as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the\r\nwork we are in to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall\r\nhave borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which\r\nmay achieve, and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and\r\nwith all nations.\"\r\n\r\nHis prayer was answered. The forty days of life that remained to\r\nhim were crowned with great historic events. He lived to see\r\nhis Proclamation of Emancipation embodied in an amendment of the\r\nConstitution, adopted by Congress, and submitted to the States for\r\nratification. The mighty scourge of war did speedily pass away, for it\r\nwas given him to witness the surrender of the Rebel army and the fall of\r\ntheir capital, and the starry flag that he loved waving in triumph over\r\nthe national soil. When he died by the madman's hand in the supreme hour\r\nof victory, the vanquished lost their best friend, and the human race\r\none of its noblest examples; and all the friends of freedom and justice,\r\nin whose cause he lived and died, joined hands as mourners at his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, 1832-1843\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1832\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF SANGAMON COUNTY.\r\n\r\nMarch 9, 1832.\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS:--Having become a candidate for the honorable office of\r\none of your Representatives in the next General Assembly of this State,\r\nin according with an established custom and the principles of true\r\nRepublicanism it becomes my duty to make known to you, the people whom I\r\npropose to represent, my sentiments with regard to local affairs.\r\n\r\nTime and experience have verified to a demonstration the public utility\r\nof internal improvements. That the poorest and most thinly populated\r\ncountries would be greatly benefited by the opening of good roads, and\r\nin the clearing of navigable streams within their limits, is what no\r\nperson will deny. Yet it is folly to undertake works of this or\r\nany other without first knowing that we are able to finish them--as\r\nhalf-finished work generally proves to be labor lost. There cannot\r\njustly be any objection to having railroads and canals, any more than to\r\nother good things, provided they cost nothing. The only objection is to\r\npaying for them; and the objection arises from the want of ability to\r\npay.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the County of Sangamon, some....\r\n\r\nYet, however desirable an object the construction of a railroad through\r\nour country may be, however high our imaginations may be heated at\r\nthoughts of it,--there is always a heart-appalling shock accompanying\r\nthe amount of its cost, which forces us to shrink from our pleasing\r\nanticipations. The probable cost of this contemplated railroad is\r\nestimated at $290,000; the bare statement of which, in my opinion, is\r\nsufficient to justify the belief that the improvement of the Sangamon\r\nRiver is an object much better suited to our infant resources.......\r\n\r\nWhat the cost of this work would be, I am unable to say. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that it would not be greater than is common to streams of the\r\nsame length. Finally, I believe the improvement of the Sangamon River\r\nto be vastly important and highly desirable to the people of the county;\r\nand, if elected, any measure in the Legislature having this for its\r\nobject, which may appear judicious, will meet my approbation and receive\r\nmy support.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the practice of loaning money at exorbitant rates of\r\ninterest has already been opened as a field for discussion; so I suppose\r\nI may enter upon it without claiming the honor or risking the danger\r\nwhich may await its first explorer. It seems as though we are never\r\nto have an end to this baneful and corroding system, acting almost as\r\nprejudicially to the general interests of the community as a direct tax\r\nof several thousand dollars annually laid on each county for the benefit\r\nof a few individuals only, unless there be a law made fixing the limits\r\nof usury. A law for this purpose, I am of opinion, may be made without\r\nmaterially injuring any class of people. In cases of extreme necessity,\r\nthere could always be means found to cheat the law; while in all other\r\ncases it would have its intended effect. I would favor the passage of\r\na law on this subject which might not be very easily evaded. Let it be\r\nsuch that the labor and difficulty of evading it could only be justified\r\nin cases of greatest necessity.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan\r\nor system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most\r\nimportant subject which we as a people can be engaged in. That every\r\nman may receive at least a moderate education, and thereby be enabled to\r\nread the histories of his own and other countries, by which he may duly\r\nappreciate the value of our free institutions, appears to be an object\r\nof vital importance, even on this account alone, to say nothing of the\r\nadvantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read\r\nthe Scriptures, and other works both of a religious and moral nature,\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I desire to see the time when education--and by its means,\r\nmorality, sobriety, enterprise, and industry--shall become much more\r\ngeneral than at present, and should be gratified to have it in my power\r\nto contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might\r\nhave a tendency to accelerate that happy period.\r\n\r\nWith regard to existing laws, some alterations are thought to be\r\nnecessary. Many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws, the\r\nlaw respecting the issuing of executions, the road law, and some others,\r\nare deficient in their present form, and require alterations. But,\r\nconsidering the great probability that the framers of those laws were\r\nwiser than myself, I should prefer not meddling with them, unless they\r\nwere first attacked by others; in which case I should feel it both a\r\nprivilege and a duty to take that stand which, in my view, might tend\r\nmost to the advancement of justice.\r\n\r\nBut, fellow-citizens, I shall conclude. Considering the great degree of\r\nmodesty which should always attend youth, it is probable I have already\r\nbeen more presuming than becomes me. However, upon the subjects of\r\nwhich I have treated, I have spoken as I have thought. I may be wrong in\r\nregard to any or all of them; but, holding it a sound maxim that it is\r\nbetter only sometimes to be right than at all times to be wrong, so soon\r\nas I discover my opinions to be erroneous, I shall be ready to renounce\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEvery man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or\r\nnot, I can say, for one, that I have no other so great as that of being\r\ntruly esteemed of my fellow-men, by rendering myself worthy of their\r\nesteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be\r\ndeveloped. I am young, and unknown to many of you. I was born, and have\r\never remained, in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy\r\nor popular relations or friends to recommend me. My case is thrown\r\nexclusively upon the independent voters of the county; and, if\r\nelected, they will have conferred a favor upon me for which I shall be\r\nunremitting in my labors to compensate. But, if the good people in\r\ntheir wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background, I have been too\r\nfamiliar with disappointments to be very much chagrined.\r\n\r\nYour friend and fellow-citizen, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nNew Salem, March 9, 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1833\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. C. BLANKENSHIP.\r\n\r\nNEW SALEM, Aug. 10, 1833\r\n\r\nE. C. BLANKENSHIP.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:--In regard to the time David Rankin served the enclosed\r\ndischarge shows correctly--as well as I can recollect--having no writing\r\nto refer. The transfer of Rankin from my company occurred as follows:\r\nRankin having lost his horse at Dixon's ferry and having acquaintance in\r\none of the foot companies who were going down the river was desirous\r\nto go with them, and one Galishen being an acquaintance of mine and\r\nbelonging to the company in which Rankin wished to go wished to leave\r\nit and join mine, this being the case it was agreed that they should\r\nexchange places and answer to each other's names--as it was expected\r\nwe all would be discharged in very few days. As to a blanket--I have no\r\nknowledge of Rankin ever getting any. The above embraces all the facts\r\nnow in my recollection which are pertinent to the case.\r\n\r\nI shall take pleasure in giving any further information in my power\r\nshould you call on me.\r\n\r\nYour friend, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR POSTAGE RECEIPT\r\n\r\nTO Mr. SPEARS.\r\n\r\nMr. SPEARS:\r\n\r\nAt your request I send you a receipt for the postage on your paper. I am\r\nsomewhat surprised at your request. I will, however, comply with it.\r\nThe law requires newspaper postage to be paid in advance, and now that\r\nI have waited a full year you choose to wound my feelings by insinuating\r\nthat unless you get a receipt I will probably make you pay it again.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1836\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT OF POLITICAL VIEWS.\r\n\r\nNew Salem, June 13, 1836.\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE \"JOURNAL\"--In your paper of last Saturday I see\r\na communication, over the signature of \"Many Voters,\" in which the\r\ncandidates who are announced in the Journal are called upon to \"show\r\ntheir hands.\" Agreed. Here's mine.\r\n\r\nI go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in\r\nbearing its burdens. Consequently, I go for admitting all whites to\r\nthe right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms (by no means excluding\r\nfemales).\r\n\r\nIf elected, I shall consider the whole people of Sangamon my\r\nconstituents, as well those that oppose as those that support me.\r\n\r\nWhile acting as their representative, I shall be governed by their will\r\non all subjects upon which I have the means of knowing what their will\r\nis; and upon all others I shall do what my own judgment teaches me\r\nwill best advance their interests. Whether elected or not, I go for\r\ndistributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands to the\r\nseveral States, to enable our State, in common with others, to dig\r\ncanals and construct railroads without borrowing money and paying the\r\ninterest on it. If alive on the first Monday in November, I shall vote\r\nfor Hugh L. White for President.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO POLITICAL SMEAR\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT ALLEN\r\n\r\nNew Salem, June 21, 1836\r\n\r\nDEAR COLONEL:--I am told that during my absence last week you passed\r\nthrough this place, and stated publicly that you were in possession of a\r\nfact or facts which, if known to the public, would entirely destroy the\r\nprospects of N. W. Edwards and myself at the ensuing election; but that,\r\nthrough favor to us, you should forbear to divulge them. No one has\r\nneeded favors more than I, and, generally, few have been less unwilling\r\nto accept them; but in this case favor to me would be injustice to the\r\npublic, and therefore I must beg your pardon for declining it. That\r\nI once had the confidence of the people of Sangamon, is sufficiently\r\nevident; and if I have since done anything, either by design or\r\nmisadventure, which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that\r\nconfidence, he that knows of that thing, and conceals it, is a traitor\r\nto his country's interest.\r\n\r\nI find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or\r\nfacts, real or supposed, you spoke; but my opinion of your veracity will\r\nnot permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed what you\r\nsaid. I am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me;\r\nbut I do hope that, on more mature reflection, you will view the public\r\ninterest as a paramount consideration, and therefore determine to let\r\nthe worst come. I here assure you that the candid statement of facts\r\non your part, however low it may sink me, shall never break the tie of\r\npersonal friendship between us. I wish an answer to this, and you are at\r\nliberty to publish both, if you choose.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MISS MARY OWENS.\r\n\r\nVANDALIA, December 13, 1836.\r\n\r\nMARY:--I have been sick ever since my arrival, or I should have written\r\nsooner. It is but little difference, however, as I have very little\r\neven yet to write. And more, the longer I can avoid the mortification\r\nof looking in the post-office for your letter and not finding it, the\r\nbetter. You see I am mad about that old letter yet. I don't like very\r\nwell to risk you again. I'll try you once more, anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe new State House is not yet finished, and consequently the\r\nLegislature is doing little or nothing. The governor delivered an\r\ninflammatory political message, and it is expected there will be some\r\nsparring between the parties about it as soon as the two Houses get to\r\nbusiness. Taylor delivered up his petition for the new county to one\r\nof our members this morning. I am told he despairs of its success, on\r\naccount of all the members from Morgan County opposing it. There are\r\nnames enough on the petition, I think, to justify the members from our\r\ncounty in going for it; but if the members from Morgan oppose it, which\r\nthey say they will, the chance will be bad.\r\n\r\nOur chance to take the seat of government to Springfield is better than\r\nI expected. An internal-improvement convention was held there since we\r\nmet, which recommended a loan of several millions of dollars, on the\r\nfaith of the State, to construct railroads. Some of the Legislature are\r\nfor it, and some against it; which has the majority I cannot tell.\r\nThere is great strife and struggling for the office of the United States\r\nSenator here at this time. It is probable we shall ease their pains in\r\na few days. The opposition men have no candidate of their own, and\r\nconsequently they will smile as complacently at the angry snarl of the\r\ncontending Van Buren candidates and their respective friends as the\r\nChristian does at Satan's rage. You recollect that I mentioned at the\r\noutset of this letter that I had been unwell. That is the fact, though\r\nI believe I am about well now; but that, with other things I cannot\r\naccount for, have conspired, and have gotten my spirits so low that I\r\nfeel that I would rather be any place in the world than here. I really\r\ncannot endure the thought of staying here ten weeks. Write back as soon\r\nas you get this, and, if possible, say something that will please me,\r\nfor really I have not been pleased since I left you. This letter is\r\nso dry and stupid that I am ashamed to send it, but with my present\r\nfeelings I cannot do any better.\r\n\r\nGive my best respects to Mr. and Mrs. Able and family.\r\n\r\nYour friend, LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1837\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nJanuary [?], 1837\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN:--Lest I should fall into the too common error of being\r\nmistaken in regard to which side I design to be upon, I shall make it\r\nmy first care to remove all doubt on that point, by declaring that I am\r\nopposed to the resolution under consideration, in toto. Before I proceed\r\nto the body of the subject, I will further remark, that it is not\r\nwithout a considerable degree of apprehension that I venture to cross\r\nthe track of the gentleman from Coles [Mr. Linder]. Indeed, I do not\r\nbelieve I could muster a sufficiency of courage to come in contact with\r\nthat gentleman, were it not for the fact that he, some days since,\r\nmost graciously condescended to assure us that he would never be found\r\nwasting ammunition on small game. On the same fortunate occasion,\r\nhe further gave us to understand, that he regarded himself as being\r\ndecidedly the superior of our common friend from Randolph [Mr. Shields];\r\nand feeling, as I really do, that I, to say the most of myself, am\r\nnothing more than the peer of our friend from Randolph, I shall\r\nregard the gentleman from Coles as decidedly my superior also, and\r\nconsequently, in the course of what I shall have to say, whenever I\r\nshall have occasion to allude to that gentleman, I shall endeavor\r\nto adopt that kind of court language which I understand to be due to\r\ndecided superiority. In one faculty, at least, there can be no dispute\r\nof the gentleman's superiority over me and most other men, and that is,\r\nthe faculty of entangling a subject, so that neither himself, or\r\nany other man, can find head or tail to it. Here he has introduced a\r\nresolution embracing ninety-nine printed lines across common writing\r\npaper, and yet more than one half of his opening speech has been made\r\nupon subjects about which there is not one word said in his resolution.\r\n\r\nThough his resolution embraces nothing in regard to the\r\nconstitutionality of the Bank, much of what he has said has been with\r\na view to make the impression that it was unconstitutional in its\r\ninception. Now, although I am satisfied that an ample field may be found\r\nwithin the pale of the resolution, at least for small game, yet, as\r\nthe gentleman has traveled out of it, I feel that I may, with all due\r\nhumility, venture to follow him. The gentleman has discovered that some\r\ngentleman at Washington city has been upon the very eve of deciding our\r\nBank unconstitutional, and that he would probably have completed his\r\nvery authentic decision, had not some one of the Bank officers placed\r\nhis hand upon his mouth, and begged him to withhold it. The fact\r\nthat the individuals composing our Supreme Court have, in an official\r\ncapacity, decided in favor of the constitutionality of the Bank, would,\r\nin my mind, seem a sufficient answer to this. It is a fact known to all,\r\nthat the members of the Supreme Court, together with the Governor, form\r\na Council of Revision, and that this Council approved this Bank charter.\r\nI ask, then, if the extra-judicial decision not quite but almost made\r\nby the gentleman at Washington, before whom, by the way, the question of\r\nthe constitutionality of our Bank never has, nor never can come--is to\r\nbe taken as paramount to a decision officially made by that tribunal,\r\nby which, and which alone, the constitutionality of the Bank can ever be\r\nsettled? But, aside from this view of the subject, I would ask, if the\r\ncommittee which this resolution proposes to appoint are to examine into\r\nthe Constitutionality of the Bank? Are they to be clothed with power to\r\nsend for persons and papers, for this object? And after they have found\r\nthe bank to be unconstitutional, and decided it so, how are they to\r\nenforce their decision? What will their decision amount to? They cannot\r\ncompel the Bank to cease operations, or to change the course of its\r\noperations. What good, then, can their labors result in? Certainly none.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman asks, if we, without an examination, shall, by giving the\r\nState deposits to the Bank, and by taking the stock reserved for the\r\nState, legalize its former misconduct. Now I do not pretend to possess\r\nsufficient legal knowledge to decide whether a legislative enactment\r\nproposing to, and accepting from, the Bank, certain terms, would have\r\nthe effect to legalize or wipe out its former errors, or not; but I can\r\nassure the gentleman, if such should be the effect, he has already got\r\nbehind the settlement of accounts; for it is well known to all, that the\r\nLegislature, at its last session, passed a supplemental Bank charter,\r\nwhich the Bank has since accepted, and which, according to his doctrine,\r\nhas legalized all the alleged violations of its original charter in the\r\ndistribution of its stock.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to the resolution. By examination it will be found that\r\nthe first thirty-three lines, being precisely one third of the whole,\r\nrelate exclusively to the distribution of the stock by the commissioners\r\nappointed by the State. Now, Sir, it is clear that no question can arise\r\non this portion of the resolution, except a question between capitalists\r\nin regard to the ownership of stock. Some gentlemen have their stock in\r\ntheir hands, while others, who have more money than they know what to\r\ndo with, want it; and this, and this alone, is the question, to settle\r\nwhich we are called on to squander thousands of the people's money.\r\nWhat interest, let me ask, have the people in the settlement of this\r\nquestion? What difference is it to them whether the stock is owned by\r\nJudge Smith or Sam Wiggins? If any gentleman be entitled to stock in the\r\nBank, which he is kept out of possession of by others, let him assert\r\nhis right in the Supreme Court, and let him or his antagonist, whichever\r\nmay be found in the wrong, pay the costs of suit. It is an old maxim,\r\nand a very sound one, that he that dances should always pay the fiddler.\r\nNow, Sir, in the present case, if any gentlemen, whose money is a burden\r\nto them, choose to lead off a dance, I am decidedly opposed to the\r\npeople's money being used to pay the fiddler. No one can doubt that the\r\nexamination proposed by this resolution must cost the State some ten or\r\ntwelve thousand dollars; and all this to settle a question in which\r\nthe people have no interest, and about which they care nothing. These\r\ncapitalists generally act harmoniously and in concert, to fleece the\r\npeople, and now that they have got into a quarrel with themselves we are\r\ncalled upon to appropriate the people's money to settle the quarrel.\r\n\r\nI leave this part of the resolution and proceed to the remainder. It\r\nwill be found that no charge in the remaining part of the resolution, if\r\ntrue, amounts to the violation of the Bank charter, except one, which I\r\nwill notice in due time. It might seem quite sufficient to say no more\r\nupon any of these charges or insinuations than enough to show they are\r\nnot violations of the charter; yet, as they are ingeniously framed and\r\nhandled, with a view to deceive and mislead, I will notice in their\r\norder all the most prominent of them. The first of these is in relation\r\nto a connection between our Bank and several banking institutions in\r\nother States. Admitting this connection to exist, I should like to see\r\nthe gentleman from Coles, or any other gentleman, undertake to show that\r\nthere is any harm in it. What can there be in such a connection, that\r\nthe people of Illinois are willing to pay their money to get a peep\r\ninto? By a reference to the tenth section of the Bank charter, any\r\ngentleman can see that the framers of the act contemplated the holding\r\nof stock in the institutions of other corporations. Why, then, is it,\r\nwhen neither law nor justice forbids it, that we are asked to spend our\r\ntime and money in inquiring into its truth?\r\n\r\nThe next charge, in the order of time, is, that some officer, director,\r\nclerk or servant of the Bank, has been required to take an oath of\r\nsecrecy in relation to the affairs of said Bank. Now, I do not know\r\nwhether this be true or false--neither do I believe any honest man\r\ncares. I know that the seventh section of the charter expressly\r\nguarantees to the Bank the right of making, under certain restrictions,\r\nsuch by-laws as it may think fit; and I further know that the requiring\r\nan oath of secrecy would not transcend those restrictions. What, then,\r\nif the Bank has chosen to exercise this right? Whom can it injure? Does\r\nnot every merchant have his secret mark? and who is ever silly enough\r\nto complain of it? I presume if the Bank does require any such oath of\r\nsecrecy, it is done through a motive of delicacy to those individuals\r\nwho deal with it. Why, Sir, not many days since, one gentleman upon this\r\nfloor, who, by the way, I have no doubt is now ready to join this hue\r\nand cry against the Bank, indulged in a philippic against one of the\r\nBank officials, because, as he said, he had divulged a secret.\r\n\r\nImmediately following this last charge, there are several insinuations\r\nin the resolution, which are too silly to require any sort of notice,\r\nwere it not for the fact that they conclude by saying, \"to the great\r\ninjury of the people at large.\" In answer to this I would say that it\r\nis strange enough, that the people are suffering these \"great injuries,\"\r\nand yet are not sensible of it! Singular indeed that the people should\r\nbe writhing under oppression and injury, and yet not one among them\r\nto be found to raise the voice of complaint. If the Bank be inflicting\r\ninjury upon the people, why is it that not a single petition is\r\npresented to this body on the subject? If the Bank really be a\r\ngrievance, why is it that no one of the real people is found to ask\r\nredress of it? The truth is, no such oppression exists. If it did, our\r\npeople would groan with memorials and petitions, and we would not be\r\npermitted to rest day or night, till we had put it down. The people know\r\ntheir rights, and they are never slow to assert and maintain them, when\r\nthey are invaded. Let them call for an investigation, and I shall ever\r\nstand ready to respond to the call. But they have made no such call. I\r\nmake the assertion boldly, and without fear of contradiction, that no\r\nman, who does not hold an office, or does not aspire to one, has ever\r\nfound any fault of the Bank. It has doubled the prices of the products\r\nof their farms, and filled their pockets with a sound circulating\r\nmedium, and they are all well pleased with its operations. No, Sir, it\r\nis the politician who is the first to sound the alarm (which, by\r\nthe way, is a false one.) It is he, who, by these unholy means, is\r\nendeavoring to blow up a storm that he may ride upon and direct. It is\r\nhe, and he alone, that here proposes to spend thousands of the people's\r\npublic treasure, for no other advantage to them than to make valueless\r\nin their pockets the reward of their industry. Mr. Chairman, this work\r\nis exclusively the work of politicians; a set of men who have interests\r\naside from the interests of the people, and who, to say the most of\r\nthem, are, taken as a mass, at least one long step removed from honest\r\nmen. I say this with the greater freedom, because, being a politician\r\nmyself, none can regard it as personal.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is charged, or rather insinuated, that officers of the Bank\r\nhave loaned money at usurious rates of interest. Suppose this to be\r\ntrue, are we to send a committee of this House to inquire into it?\r\nSuppose the committee should find it true, can they redress the injured\r\nindividuals? Assuredly not. If any individual had been injured in this\r\nway, is there not an ample remedy to be found in the laws of the land?\r\nDoes the gentleman from Coles know that there is a statute standing in\r\nfull force making it highly penal for an individual to loan money at a\r\nhigher rate of interest than twelve per cent? If he does not he is too\r\nignorant to be placed at the head of the committee which his resolution\r\npurposes and if he does, his neglect to mention it shows him to be too\r\nuncandid to merit the respect or confidence of any one.\r\n\r\nBut besides all this, if the Bank were struck from existence, could\r\nnot the owners of the capital still loan it usuriously, as well as now?\r\nwhatever the Bank, or its officers, may have done, I know that\r\nusurious transactions were much more frequent and enormous before the\r\ncommencement of its operations than they have ever been since.\r\n\r\nThe next insinuation is, that the Bank has refused specie payments.\r\nThis, if true is a violation of the charter. But there is not the\r\nleast probability of its truth; because, if such had been the fact, the\r\nindividual to whom payment was refused would have had an interest in\r\nmaking it public, by suing for the damages to which the charter entitles\r\nhim. Yet no such thing has been done; and the strong presumption is,\r\nthat the insinuation is false and groundless.\r\n\r\nFrom this to the end of the resolution, there is nothing that merits\r\nattention--I therefore drop the particular examination of it.\r\n\r\nBy a general view of the resolution, it will be seen that a principal\r\nobject of the committee is to examine into, and ferret out, a mass of\r\ncorruption supposed to have been committed by the commissioners\r\nwho apportioned the stock of the Bank. I believe it is universally\r\nunderstood and acknowledged that all men will ever act correctly unless\r\nthey have a motive to do otherwise. If this be true, we can only suppose\r\nthat the commissioners acted corruptly by also supposing that they were\r\nbribed to do so. Taking this view of the subject, I would ask if the\r\nBank is likely to find it more difficult to bribe the committee of\r\nseven, which, we are about to appoint, than it may have found it to\r\nbribe the commissioners?\r\n\r\n(Here Mr. Linder called to order. The Chair decided that Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas not out of order. Mr. Linder appealed to the House, but, before the\r\nquestion was put, withdrew his appeal, saying he preferred to let the\r\ngentleman go on; he thought he would break his own neck. Mr. Lincoln\r\nproceeded:)\r\n\r\nAnother gracious condescension! I acknowledge it with gratitude. I know\r\nI was not out of order; and I know every sensible man in the House knows\r\nit. I was not saying that the gentleman from Coles could be bribed, nor,\r\non the other hand, will I say he could not. In that particular I leave\r\nhim where I found him. I was only endeavoring to show that there was at\r\nleast as great a probability of any seven members that could be selected\r\nfrom this House being bribed to act corruptly, as there was that the\r\ntwenty-four commissioners had been so bribed. By a reference to\r\nthe ninth section of the Bank charter, it will be seen that those\r\ncommissioners were John Tilson, Robert K. McLaughlin, Daniel Warm, A.G.\r\nS. Wight, John C. Riley, W. H. Davidson, Edward M. Wilson, Edward L.\r\nPierson, Robert R. Green, Ezra Baker, Aquilla Wren, John Taylor, Samuel\r\nC. Christy, Edmund Roberts, Benjamin Godfrey, Thomas Mather, A. M.\r\nJenkins, W. Linn, W. S. Gilman, Charles Prentice, Richard I. Hamilton,\r\nA.H. Buckner, W. F. Thornton, and Edmund D. Taylor.\r\n\r\nThese are twenty-four of the most respectable men in the State. Probably\r\nno twenty-four men could be selected in the State with whom the people\r\nare better acquainted, or in whose honor and integrity they would\r\nmore readily place confidence. And I now repeat, that there is less\r\nprobability that those men have been bribed and corrupted, than that\r\nany seven men, or rather any six men, that could be selected from the\r\nmembers of this House, might be so bribed and corrupted, even though\r\nthey were headed and led on by \"decided superiority\" himself.\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, I ask every reasonable man, if an issue be joined\r\nby these twenty-four commissioners, on the one part, and any other\r\nseven men, on the other part, and the whole depend upon the honor and\r\nintegrity of the contending parties, to which party would the greatest\r\ndegree of credit be due? Again: Another consideration is, that we have\r\nno right to make the examination. What I shall say upon this head I\r\ndesign exclusively for the law-loving and law-abiding part of the House.\r\nTo those who claim omnipotence for the Legislature, and who in the\r\nplenitude of their assumed powers are disposed to disregard the\r\nConstitution, law, good faith, moral right, and everything else, I have\r\nnot a word to say. But to the law-abiding part I say, examine the Bank\r\ncharter, go examine the Constitution, go examine the acts that the\r\nGeneral Assembly of this State has passed, and you will find just as\r\nmuch authority given in each and every of them to compel the Bank to\r\nbring its coffers to this hall and to pour their contents upon this\r\nfloor, as to compel it to submit to this examination which this\r\nresolution proposes. Why, Sir, the gentleman from Coles, the mover of\r\nthis resolution, very lately denied on this floor that the Legislature\r\nhad any right to repeal or otherwise meddle with its own acts, when\r\nthose acts were made in the nature of contracts, and had been accepted\r\nand acted on by other parties. Now I ask if this resolution does not\r\npropose, for this House alone, to do what he, but the other day, denied\r\nthe right of the whole Legislature to do? He must either abandon the\r\nposition he then took, or he must now vote against his own resolution.\r\nIt is no difference to me, and I presume but little to any one else,\r\nwhich he does.\r\n\r\nI am by no means the special advocate of the Bank. I have long thought\r\nthat it would be well for it to report its condition to the General\r\nAssembly, and that cases might occur, when it might be proper to make an\r\nexamination of its affairs by a committee. Accordingly, during the\r\nlast session, while a bill supplemental to the Bank charter was pending\r\nbefore the House, I offered an amendment to the same, in these words:\r\n\"The said corporation shall, at the next session of the General\r\nAssembly, and at each subsequent General Session, during the existence\r\nof its charter, report to the same the amount of debts due from said\r\ncorporation; the amount of debts due to the same; the amount of specie\r\nin its vaults, and an account of all lands then owned by the same, and\r\nthe amount for which such lands have been taken; and moreover, if said\r\ncorporation shall at any time neglect or refuse to submit its books,\r\npapers, and all and everything necessary for a full and fair examination\r\nof its affairs, to any person or persons appointed by the General\r\nAssembly, for the purpose of making such examination, the said\r\ncorporation shall forfeit its charter.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment was negatived by a vote of 34 to 15. Eleven of the 34 who\r\nvoted against it are now members of this House; and though it would\r\nbe out of order to call their names, I hope they will all recollect\r\nthemselves, and not vote for this examination to be made without\r\nauthority, inasmuch as they refused to receive the authority when it was\r\nin their power to do so.\r\n\r\nI have said that cases might occur, when an examination might be proper;\r\nbut I do not believe any such case has now occurred; and if it has,\r\nI should still be opposed to making an examination without legal\r\nauthority. I am opposed to encouraging that lawless and mobocratic\r\nspirit, whether in relation to the Bank or anything else, which is\r\nalready abroad in the land and is spreading with rapid and fearful\r\nimpetuosity, to the ultimate overthrow of every institution, of every\r\nmoral principle, in which persons and property have hitherto found\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nBut supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result\r\nfrom the examination? Can we declare the Bank unconstitutional, and\r\ncompel it to desist from the abuses of its power, provided we find such\r\nabuses to exist? Can we repair the injuries which it may have done to\r\nindividuals? Most certainly we can do none of these things. Why\r\nthen shall we spend the public money in such employment? Oh, say the\r\nexaminers, we can injure the credit of the Bank, if nothing else, Please\r\ntell me, gentlemen, who will suffer most by that? You cannot injure, to\r\nany extent, the stockholders. They are men of wealth--of large capital;\r\nand consequently, beyond the power of malice. But by injuring the credit\r\nof the Bank, you will depreciate the value of its paper in the hands of\r\nthe honest and unsuspecting farmer and mechanic, and that is all you can\r\ndo. But suppose you could effect your whole purpose; suppose you could\r\nwipe the Bank from existence, which is the grand ultimatum of the\r\nproject, what would be the consequence? why, Sir, we should spend\r\nseveral thousand dollars of the public treasure in the operation,\r\nannihilate the currency of the State, render valueless in the hands of\r\nour people that reward of their former labors, and finally be once more\r\nunder the comfortable obligation of paying the Wiggins loan, principal\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPOSITION TO MOB-RULE\r\n\r\nADDRESS BEFORE THE YOUNG MEN'S LYCEUM OF SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nJanuary 27, 1837.\r\n\r\nAs a subject for the remarks of the evening, \"The Perpetuation of our\r\nPolitical Institutions\" is selected.\r\n\r\nIn the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American\r\npeople, find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of\r\nthe Christian era. We find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the\r\nfairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory, fertility\r\nof soil, and salubrity of climate. We find ourselves under the\r\ngovernment of a system of political institutions conducing more\r\nessentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which\r\nthe history of former times tells us. We, when mounting the stage of\r\nexistence, found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental\r\nblessings. We toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them;\r\nthey are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic,\r\nbut now lamented and departed, race of ancestors. Theirs was the\r\ntask (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and through\r\nthemselves us, of this goodly land, and to uprear upon its hills and its\r\nvalleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; it is ours only\r\nto transmit these--the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader, the\r\nlatter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation--to the\r\nlatest generation that fate shall permit the world to know. This task\r\ngratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to posterity, and\r\nlove for our species in general, all imperatively require us faithfully\r\nto perform.\r\n\r\nHow then shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the approach\r\nof danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect\r\nsome transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a\r\nblow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with\r\nall the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military\r\nchest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink\r\nfrom the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAt what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer:\r\nIf it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from\r\nabroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and\r\nfinisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time, or die\r\nby suicide.\r\n\r\nI hope I am over-wary; but if I am not, there is even now something\r\nof ill omen amongst us. I mean the increasing disregard for law which\r\npervades the country--the growing disposition to substitute the wild and\r\nfurious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the\r\nworse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice. This\r\ndisposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that it now\r\nexists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a\r\nviolation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny. Accounts\r\nof outrages committed by mobs form the everyday news of the times.\r\nThey have pervaded the country from New England to Louisiana; they are\r\nneither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns\r\nof the latter; they are not the creature of climate, neither are they\r\nconfined to the slave holding or the non-slave holding States. Alike\r\nthey spring up among the pleasure-hunting masters of Southern slaves,\r\nand the order-loving citizens of the land of steady habits. Whatever\r\nthen their cause may be, it is common to the whole country.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of\r\nthem. Those happening in the State of Mississippi and at St. Louis are\r\nperhaps the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity. In the\r\nMississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers--a\r\nset of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or\r\nvery honest occupation, but one which, so far from being forbidden by\r\nthe laws, was actually licensed by an act of the Legislature passed but\r\na single year before. Next, negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an\r\ninsurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State;\r\nthen, white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally,\r\nstrangers from neighboring States, going thither on business, were in\r\nmany instances subjected to the same fate. Thus went on this process of\r\nhanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and\r\nfrom these to strangers, till dead men were seen literally dangling\r\nfrom the boughs of trees upon every roadside, and in numbers almost\r\nsufficient to rival the native Spanish moss of the country as a drapery\r\nof the forest.\r\n\r\nTurn then to that horror-striking scene at St. Louis. A single victim\r\nonly was sacrificed there. This story is very short, and is perhaps\r\nthe most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been\r\nwitnessed in real life. A mulatto man by the name of McIntosh was seized\r\nin the street, dragged to the suburbs of the city, chained to a tree,\r\nand actually burned to death; and all within a single hour from the time\r\nhe had been a freeman attending to his own business and at peace with\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nSuch are the effects of mob law, and such are the scenes becoming more\r\nand more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and\r\norder, and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to\r\nattract anything more than an idle remark.\r\n\r\nBut you are perhaps ready to ask, \"What has this to do with the\r\nperpetuation of our political institutions?\" I answer, It has much to\r\ndo with it. Its direct consequences are, comparatively speaking, but\r\na small evil, and much of its danger consists in the proneness of\r\nour minds to regard its direct as its only consequences. Abstractly\r\nconsidered, the hanging of the gamblers at Vicksburg was of but little\r\nconsequence. They constitute a portion of population that is worse than\r\nuseless in any community; and their death, if no pernicious example be\r\nset by it, is never matter of reasonable regret with any one. If\r\nthey were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or\r\nsmallpox, honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operation.\r\nSimilar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the\r\nnegro at St. Louis. He had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an\r\noutrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens\r\nof the city, and had he not died as he did, he must have died by the\r\nsentence of the law in a very short time afterwards. As to him alone,\r\nit was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been. But the\r\nexample in either case was fearful. When men take it in their heads\r\nto-day to hang gamblers or burn murderers, they should recollect that in\r\nthe confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely\r\nto hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one\r\nwho is, and that, acting upon the example they set, the mob of to-morrow\r\nmay, and probably will, hang or burn some of them by the very same\r\nmistake. And not only so: the innocent, those who have ever set their\r\nfaces against violations of law in every shape, alike with the guilty\r\nfall victims to the ravages of mob law; and thus it goes on, step by\r\nstep, till all the walls erected for the defense of the persons and\r\nproperty of individuals are trodden down and disregarded. But all this,\r\neven, is not the full extent of the evil. By such examples, by instances\r\nof the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit\r\nare encouraged to become lawless in practice; and having been used to\r\nno restraint but dread of punishment, they thus become absolutely\r\nunrestrained. Having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane,\r\nthey make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations, and pray for\r\nnothing so much as its total annihilation. While, on the other hand,\r\ngood men, men who love tranquillity, who desire to abide by the laws and\r\nenjoy their benefits, who would gladly spill their blood in the defense\r\nof their country, seeing their property destroyed, their families\r\ninsulted, and their lives endangered, their persons injured, and seeing\r\nnothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better, become tired\r\nof and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection, and\r\nare not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing\r\nto lose. Thus, then, by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which\r\nall must admit is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of\r\nany government, and particularly of those constituted like ours, may\r\neffectually be broken down and destroyed--I mean the attachment of the\r\npeople. Whenever this effect shall be produced among us; whenever the\r\nvicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands\r\nof hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob\r\nprovision-stores, throw printing presses into rivers, shoot editors, and\r\nhang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity, depend on\r\nit, this government cannot last. By such things the feelings of the best\r\ncitizens will become more or less alienated from it, and thus it will\r\nbe left without friends, or with too few, and those few too weak to\r\nmake their friendship effectual. At such a time, and under such\r\ncircumstances, men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting\r\nto seize the opportunity, strike the blow, and overturn that fair fabric\r\nwhich for the last half century has been the fondest hope of the lovers\r\nof freedom throughout the world.\r\n\r\nI know the American people are much attached to their government; I know\r\nthey would suffer much for its sake; I know they would endure evils\r\nlong and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for\r\nanother,--yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually\r\ndespised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons\r\nand property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob,\r\nthe alienation of their affections from the government is the natural\r\nconsequence; and to that, sooner or later, it must come.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is one point at which danger may be expected.\r\n\r\nThe question recurs, How shall we fortify against it? The answer is\r\nsimple. Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to\r\nhis posterity swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate\r\nin the least particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate\r\ntheir violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the\r\nsupport of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the\r\nConstitution and laws let every American pledge his life, his property,\r\nand his sacred honor. Let every man remember that to violate the law is\r\nto trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his\r\nown and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed\r\nby every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap;\r\nlet it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be\r\nwritten in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs; let it be preached\r\nfrom the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts\r\nof justice. And, in short, let it become the political religion of the\r\nnation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the\r\ngrave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions,\r\nsacrifice unceasingly upon its altars.\r\n\r\nWhile ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even\r\nvery generally prevail throughout the nation, vain will be every effort,\r\nand fruitless every attempt, to subvert our national freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen, I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me\r\nnot be understood as saying there are no bad laws, or that grievances\r\nmay not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been\r\nmade. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that although\r\nbad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still,\r\nwhile they continue in force, for the sake of example they should be\r\nreligiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If such arise, let\r\nproper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay,\r\nbut till then let them, if not too intolerable, be borne with.\r\n\r\nThere is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law. In any\r\ncase that may arise, as, for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism,\r\none of two positions is necessarily true--that is, the thing is right\r\nwithin itself, and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all\r\ngood citizens, or it is wrong, and therefore proper to be prohibited by\r\nlegal enactments; and in neither case is the interposition of mob law\r\neither necessary, justifiable, or excusable.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, Why suppose danger to our political institutions?\r\nHave we not preserved them for more than fifty years? And why may we not\r\nfor fifty times as long?\r\n\r\nWe hope there is no sufficient reason. We hope all danger may be\r\novercome; but to conclude that no danger may ever arise would itself be\r\nextremely dangerous. There are now, and will hereafter be, many causes,\r\ndangerous in their tendency, which have not existed heretofore, and\r\nwhich are not too insignificant to merit attention. That our government\r\nshould have been maintained in its original form, from its establishment\r\nuntil now, is not much to be wondered at. It had many props to support\r\nit through that period, which now are decayed and crumbled away. Through\r\nthat period it was felt by all to be an undecided experiment; now it is\r\nunderstood to be a successful one. Then, all that sought celebrity\r\nand fame and distinction expected to find them in the success of that\r\nexperiment. Their all was staked upon it; their destiny was inseparably\r\nlinked with it. Their ambition aspired to display before an admiring\r\nworld a practical demonstration of the truth of a proposition which had\r\nhitherto been considered at best no better than problematical--namely,\r\nthe capability of a people to govern themselves. If they succeeded they\r\nwere to be immortalized; their names were to be transferred to counties,\r\nand cities, and rivers, and mountains; and to be revered and sung,\r\ntoasted through all time. If they failed, they were to be called\r\nknaves and fools, and fanatics for a fleeting hour; then to sink and be\r\nforgotten. They succeeded. The experiment is successful, and thousands\r\nhave won their deathless names in making it so. But the game is caught;\r\nand I believe it is true that with the catching end the pleasures of\r\nthe chase. This field of glory is harvested, and the crop is already\r\nappropriated. But new reapers will arise, and they too will seek a\r\nfield. It is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true, to\r\nsuppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring\r\nup amongst us. And when they do, they will as naturally seek the\r\ngratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them.\r\nThe question then is, Can that gratification be found in supporting\r\nand in maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Most\r\ncertainly it cannot. Many great and good men, sufficiently qualified for\r\nany task they should undertake, may ever be found whose ambition would\r\naspire to nothing beyond a seat in Congress, a Gubernatorial or a\r\nPresidential chair; but such belong not to the family of the lion, or\r\nthe tribe of the eagle. What! think you these places would satisfy an\r\nAlexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon? Never! Towering genius disdains\r\na beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no\r\ndistinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected\r\nto the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve\r\nunder any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor,\r\nhowever illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and if\r\npossible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves\r\nor enslaving freemen. Is it unreasonable, then, to expect that some man\r\npossessed of the loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to\r\npush it to its utmost stretch, will at some time spring up among us? And\r\nwhen such an one does it will require the people to be united with each\r\nother, attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent,\r\nto successfully frustrate his designs.\r\n\r\nDistinction will be his paramount object, and although he would as\r\nwillingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm, yet,\r\nthat opportunity being past, and nothing left to be done in the way of\r\nbuilding up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down.\r\n\r\nHere then is a probable case, highly dangerous, and such an one as could\r\nnot have well existed heretofore.\r\n\r\nAnother reason which once was, but which, to the same extent, is now no\r\nmore, has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far. I mean the\r\npowerful influence which the interesting scenes of the Revolution had\r\nupon the passions of the people as distinguished from their judgment. By\r\nthis influence, the jealousy, envy, and avarice incident to our nature,\r\nand so common to a state of peace, prosperity, and conscious strength,\r\nwere for the time in a great measure smothered and rendered inactive,\r\nwhile the deep-rooted principles of hate, and the powerful motive of\r\nrevenge, instead of being turned against each other, were directed\r\nexclusively against the British nation. And thus, from the force of\r\ncircumstances, the basest principles of our nature were either made to\r\nlie dormant, or to become the active agents in the advancement of\r\nthe noblest of causes--that of establishing and maintaining civil and\r\nreligious liberty.\r\n\r\nBut this state of feeling must fade, is fading, has faded, with the\r\ncircumstances that produced it.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that the scenes of the Revolution are now or ever\r\nwill be entirely forgotten, but that, like everything else, they must\r\nfade upon the memory of the world, and grow more and more dim by the\r\nlapse of time. In history, we hope, they will be read of, and recounted,\r\nso long as the Bible shall be read; but even granting that they will,\r\ntheir influence cannot be what it heretofore has been. Even then they\r\ncannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the\r\ngeneration just gone to rest. At the close of that struggle, nearly\r\nevery adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes. The\r\nconsequence was that of those scenes, in the form of a husband, a\r\nfather, a son, or a brother, a living history was to be found in\r\nevery family--a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its own\r\nauthenticity, in the limbs mangled, in the scars of wounds received, in\r\nthe midst of the very scenes related--a history, too, that could be read\r\nand understood alike by all, the wise and the ignorant, the learned and\r\nthe unlearned. But those histories are gone. They can be read no more\r\nforever. They were a fortress of strength; but what invading foeman\r\ncould never do the silent artillery of time has done--the leveling of\r\nits walls. They are gone. They were a forest of giant oaks; but the\r\nall-restless hurricane has swept over them, and left only here and\r\nthere a lonely trunk, despoiled of its verdure, shorn of its foliage,\r\nunshading and unshaded, to murmur in a few more gentle breezes, and to\r\ncombat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms, then to sink\r\nand be no more.\r\n\r\nThey were pillars of the temple of liberty; and now that they have\r\ncrumbled away that temple must fall unless we, their descendants, supply\r\ntheir places with other pillars, hewn from the solid quarry of sober\r\nreason. Passion has helped us, but can do so no more. It will in future\r\nbe our enemy. Reason cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason--must\r\nfurnish all the materials for our future support and defense. Let those\r\nmaterials be moulded into general intelligence, sound morality, and\r\nin particular, a reverence for the Constitution and laws; and that we\r\nimproved to the last, that we remained free to the last, that we revered\r\nhis name to the last, that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile\r\nfoot to pass over or desecrate his resting place, shall be that which to\r\nlearn the last trump shall awaken our Washington.\r\n\r\nUpon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest, as the rock of its\r\nbasis; and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution,\r\n\"the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTEST IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nMarch 3, 1837.\r\n\r\nThe following protest was presented to the House, which was read and\r\nordered to be spread in the journals, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both\r\nbranches of the General Assembly at its present session, the undersigned\r\nhereby protest against the passage of the same.\r\n\r\n\"They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both\r\ninjustice and bad policy, but that the promulgation of abolition\r\ndoctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.\r\n\r\n\"They believe that the Congress of the United States has no power under\r\nthe Constitution to interfere with the institution of slavery in the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\n\"They believe that the Congress of the United States has the power,\r\nunder the Constitution, to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia,\r\nbut that the power ought not to be exercised, unless at the request of\r\nthe people of the District.\r\n\r\n\"The difference between these opinions and those contained in the said\r\nresolutions is their reason for entering this protest.\r\n\r\n\"DAN STONE,\r\n\r\n\"A.

OWENS.\r\n\r\nFRIEND MARY:--I have commenced two letters to send you before this, both\r\nof which displeased me before I got half done, and so I tore them up.\r\nThe first I thought was not serious enough, and the second was on the\r\nother extreme. I shall send this, turn out as it may.\r\n\r\nThis thing of living in Springfield is rather a dull business, after\r\nall; at least it is so to me. I am quite as lonesome here as I ever was\r\nanywhere in my life. I have been spoken to by but one woman since I have\r\nbeen here, and should not have been by her if she could have avoided it.\r\nI 've never been to church yet, and probably shall not be soon. I stay\r\naway because I am conscious I should not know how to behave myself.\r\n\r\nI am often thinking of what we said about your coming to live at\r\nSpringfield. I am afraid you would not be satisfied. There is a great\r\ndeal of flourishing about in carriages here, which it would be your doom\r\nto see without sharing it. You would have to be poor, without the means\r\nof hiding your poverty. Do you believe you could bear that patiently?\r\nWhatever woman may cast her lot with mine, should any ever do so, it is\r\nmy intention to do all in my power to make her happy and contented; and\r\nthere is nothing I can imagine that would make me more unhappy than to\r\nfail in the effort. I know I should be much happier with you than the\r\nway I am, provided I saw no signs of discontent in you. What you have\r\nsaid to me may have been in the way of jest, or I may have misunderstood\r\nyou. If so, then let it be forgotten; if otherwise, I much wish you\r\nwould think seriously before you decide. What I have said I will most\r\npositively abide by, provided you wish it. My opinion is that you had\r\nbetter not do it. You have not been accustomed to hardship, and it may\r\nbe more severe than you now imagine. I know you are capable of thinking\r\ncorrectly on any subject, and if you deliberate maturely upon this\r\nsubject before you decide, then I am willing to abide your decision.\r\n\r\nYou must write me a good long letter after you get this. You have\r\nnothing else to do, and though it might not seem interesting to you\r\nafter you had written it, it would be a good deal of company to me in\r\nthis \"busy wilderness.\" Tell your sister I don't want to hear any more\r\nabout selling out and moving. That gives me the \"hypo\" whenever I think\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nYours, etc., LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BENNETT.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug. 5, 1837. JOHN BENNETT, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:-Mr. Edwards tells me you wish to know whether the act to which\r\nyour own incorporation provision was attached passed into a law. It\r\ndid. You can organize under the general incorporation law as soon as you\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\nI also tacked a provision onto a fellow's bill to authorize the\r\nrelocation of the road from Salem down to your town, but I am not\r\ncertain whether or not the bill passed, neither do I suppose I can\r\nascertain before the law will be published, if it is a law. Bowling\r\nGreene, Bennette Abe? and yourself are appointed to make the change. No\r\nnews. No excitement except a little about the election of Monday next.\r\n\r\nI suppose, of course, our friend Dr. Heney stands no chance in your\r\ndiggings.\r\n\r\nYour friend and humble servant, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MARY OWENS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. 16, 1837\r\n\r\nFRIEND MARY: You will no doubt think it rather strange that I should\r\nwrite you a letter on the same day on which we parted, and I can only\r\naccount for it by supposing that seeing you lately makes me think of you\r\nmore than usual; while at our late meeting we had but few expressions\r\nof thoughts. You must know that I cannot see you, or think of you, with\r\nentire indifference; and yet it may be that you are mistaken in regard\r\nto what my real feelings toward you are.\r\n\r\nIf I knew you were not, I should not have troubled you with this letter.\r\nPerhaps any other man would know enough without information; but I\r\nconsider it my peculiar right to plead ignorance, and your bounden duty\r\nto allow the plea.\r\n\r\nI want in all cases to do right; and most particularly so in all cases\r\nwith women.\r\n\r\nI want, at this particular time, more than any thing else to do right\r\nwith you; and if I knew it would be doing right, as I rather suspect it\r\nwould, to let you alone I would do it. And, for the purpose of making\r\nthe matter as plain as possible, I now say that you can drop the\r\nsubject, dismiss your thoughts (if you ever had any) from me for ever\r\nand leave this letter unanswered without calling forth one accusing\r\nmurmur from me. And I will even go further and say that, if it will add\r\nanything to your comfort or peace of mind to do so, it is my sincere\r\nwish that you should. Do not understand by this that I wish to cut your\r\nacquaintance. I mean no such thing. What I do wish is that our further\r\nacquaintance shall depend upon yourself. If such further acquaintance\r\nwould contribute nothing to your happiness, I am sure it would not to\r\nmine. If you feel yourself in any degree bound to me, I am now willing\r\nto release you, provided you wish it; while on the other hand I am\r\nwilling and even anxious to bind you faster if I can be convinced\r\nthat it will, in any considerable degree, add to your happiness. This,\r\nindeed, is the whole question with me. Nothing would make me more\r\nmiserable than to believe you miserable, nothing more happy than to know\r\nyou were so.\r\n\r\nIn what I have now said, I think I cannot be misunderstood; and to make\r\nmyself understood is the only object of this letter.\r\n\r\nIf it suits you best not to answer this, farewell. A long life and\r\na merry one attend you. But, if you conclude to write back, speak as\r\nplainly as I do. There can neither be harm nor danger in saying to me\r\nanything you think, just in the manner you think it. My respects to your\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nYour friend, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGAL SUIT OF WIDOW v.s. Gen. ADAMS\r\n\r\nTO THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\"SANGAMON JOURNAL,\" SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug. 19, 1837.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with our determination, as expressed last week, we present\r\nto the reader the articles which were published in hand-bill form, in\r\nreference to the case of the heirs of Joseph Anderson vs. James Adams.\r\nThese articles can now be read uninfluenced by personal or party\r\nfeeling, and with the sole motive of learning the truth. When that is\r\ndone, the reader can pass his own judgment on the matters at issue.\r\n\r\nWe only regret in this case, that the publications were not made some\r\nweeks before the election. Such a course might have prevented the\r\nexpressions of regret, which have often been heard since, from different\r\nindividuals, on account of the disposition they made of their votes.\r\n\r\nTo the Public:\r\n\r\nIt is well known to most of you, that there is existing at this time\r\nconsiderable excitement in regard to Gen. Adams's titles to certain\r\ntracts of land, and the manner in which he acquired them. As I\r\nunderstand, the Gen. charges that the whole has been gotten up by a knot\r\nof lawyers to injure his election; and as I am one of the knot to which\r\nhe refers, and as I happen to be in possession of facts connected with\r\nthe matter, I will, in as brief a manner as possible, make a statement\r\nof them, together with the means by which I arrived at the knowledge of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSometime in May or June last, a widow woman, by the name of Anderson,\r\nand her son, who resides in Fulton county, came to Springfield, for\r\nthe purpose as they said of selling a ten acre lot of ground lying near\r\ntown, which they claimed as the property of the deceased husband and\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached town they found the land was claimed by Gen. Adams.\r\nJohn T. Stuart and myself were employed to look into the matter, and if\r\nit was thought we could do so with any prospect of success, to commence\r\na suit for the land. I went immediately to the recorder's office to\r\nexamine Adams's title, and found that the land had been entered by one\r\nDixon, deeded by Dixon to Thomas, by Thomas to one Miller, and by Miller\r\nto Gen. Adams. The oldest of these three deeds was about ten or eleven\r\nyears old, and the latest more than five, all recorded at the same\r\ntime, and that within less than one year. This I thought a suspicious\r\ncircumstance, and I was thereby induced to examine the deeds very\r\nclosely, with a view to the discovery of some defect by which to\r\noverturn the title, being almost convinced then it was founded in fraud.\r\nI discovered that in the deed from Thomas to Miller, although Miller's\r\nname stood in a sort of marginal note on the record book, it was nowhere\r\nin the deed itself. I told the fact to Talbott, the recorder, and\r\nproposed to him that he should go to Gen. Adams's and get the original\r\ndeed, and compare it with the record, and thereby ascertain whether\r\nthe defect was in the original or there was merely an error in the\r\nrecording. As Talbott afterwards told me, he went to the General's, but\r\nnot finding him at home, got the deed from his son, which, when compared\r\nwith the record, proved what we had discovered was merely an error of\r\nthe recorder. After Mr. Talbott corrected the record, he brought the\r\noriginal to our office, as I then thought and think yet, to show us\r\nthat it was right. When he came into the room he handed the deed to me,\r\nremarking that the fault was all his own. On opening it, another paper\r\nfell out of it, which on examination proved to be an assignment of a\r\njudgment in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County from Joseph Anderson,\r\nthe late husband of the widow above named, to James Adams, the judgment\r\nbeing in favor of said Anderson against one Joseph Miller. Knowing that\r\nthis judgment had some connection with the land affair, I immediately\r\ntook a copy of it, which is word for word, letter for letter and cross\r\nfor cross as follows:\r\n\r\nJoseph Anderson, vs. Joseph Miller.\r\n\r\nJudgment in Sangamon Circuit Court against Joseph Miller obtained on a\r\nnote originally 25 dolls and interest thereon accrued. I assign all my\r\nright, title and interest to James Adams which is in consideration of a\r\ndebt I owe said Adams.\r\n\r\nhis JOSEPH x ANDERSON. mark.\r\n\r\nAs the copy shows, it bore date May 10, 1827; although the judgment\r\nassigned by it was not obtained until the October afterwards, as may be\r\nseen by any one on the records of the Circuit Court. Two other strange\r\ncircumstances attended it which cannot be represented by a copy. One of\r\nthem was, that the date \"1827\" had first been made \"1837\" and, without\r\nthe figure \"3,\" being fully obliterated, the figure \"2\" had afterwards\r\nbeen made on top of it; the other was that, although the date was ten\r\nyears old, the writing on it, from the freshness of its appearance, was\r\nthought by many, and I believe by all who saw it, not to be more than a\r\nweek old. The paper on which it was written had a very old appearance;\r\nand there were some old figures on the back of it which made the\r\nfreshness of the writing on the face of it much more striking than I\r\nsuppose it otherwise might have been. The reader's curiosity is no doubt\r\nexcited to know what connection this assignment had with the land in\r\nquestion. The story is this: Dixon sold and deeded the land to Thomas;\r\nThomas sold it to Anderson; but before he gave a deed, Anderson sold it\r\nto Miller, and took Miller's note for the purchase money. When this\r\nnote became due, Anderson sued Miller on it, and Miller procured an\r\ninjunction from the Court of Chancery to stay the collection of the\r\nmoney until he should get a deed for the land. Gen. Adams was employed\r\nas an attorney by Anderson in this chancery suit, and at the October\r\nterm, 1827, the injunction was dissolved, and a judgment given in favor\r\nof Anderson against Miller; and it was provided that Thomas was to\r\nexecute a deed for the land in favor of Miller and deliver it to Gen.\r\nAdams, to be held up by him till Miller paid the judgment, and then to\r\ndeliver it to him. Miller left the county without paying the judgment.\r\nAnderson moved to Fulton county, where he has since died When the widow\r\ncame to Springfield last May or June, as before mentioned, and found the\r\nland deeded to Gen. Adams by Miller, she was naturally led to inquire\r\nwhy the money due upon the judgment had not been sent to them, inasmuch\r\nas he, Gen. Adams, had no authority to deliver Thomas's deed to Miller\r\nuntil the money was paid. Then it was the General told her, or perhaps\r\nher son, who came with her, that Anderson, in his lifetime, had assigned\r\nthe judgment to him, Gen. Adams. I am now told that the General is\r\nexhibiting an assignment of the same judgment bearing date \"1828\" and\r\nin other respects differing from the one described; and that he is\r\nasserting that no such assignment as the one copied by me ever existed;\r\nor if there did, it was forged between Talbott and the lawyers, and\r\nslipped into his papers for the purpose of injuring him. Now, I can only\r\nsay that I know precisely such a one did exist, and that Ben. Talbott,\r\nWm. Butler, C.R. Matheny, John T. Stuart, Judge Logan, Robert Irwin, P.\r\nC. Canedy and S. M. Tinsley, all saw and examined it, and that at least\r\none half of them will swear that IT WAS IN GENERAL ADAMS'S HANDWRITING!!\r\nAnd further, I know that Talbott will swear that he got it out of the\r\nGeneral's possession, and returned it into his possession again. The\r\nassignment which the General is now exhibiting purports to have been by\r\nAnderson in writing. The one I copied was signed with a cross.\r\n\r\nI am told that Gen. Neale says that he will swear that he heard Gen.\r\nAdams tell young Anderson that the assignment made by his father was\r\nsigned with a cross.\r\n\r\nThe above are 'facts,' as stated. I leave them without comment. I have\r\ngiven the names of persons who have knowledge of these facts, in order\r\nthat any one who chooses may call on them and ascertain how far they\r\nwill corroborate my statements. I have only made these statements\r\nbecause I am known by many to be one of the individuals against whom\r\nthe charge of forging the assignment and slipping it into the General's\r\npapers has been made, and because our silence might be construed into\r\na confession of its truth. I shall not subscribe my name; but I hereby\r\nauthorize the editor of the Journal to give it up to any one that may\r\ncall for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND TALBOTT IN REPLY TO GEN. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\"SANGAMON JOURNAL,\" SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Oct. 28, 1837.\r\n\r\nIn the Republican of this morning a publication of Gen. Adams's appears,\r\nin which my name is used quite unreservedly. For this I thank the\r\nGeneral. I thank him because it gives me an opportunity, without\r\nappearing obtrusive, of explaining a part of a former publication of\r\nmine, which appears to me to have been misunderstood by many.\r\n\r\nIn the former publication alluded to, I stated, in substance, that\r\nMr. Talbott got a deed from a son of Gen. Adams's for the purpose of\r\ncorrecting a mistake that had occurred on the record of the said deed\r\nin the recorder's office; that he corrected the record, and brought the\r\ndeed and handed it to me, and that on opening the deed, another paper,\r\nbeing the assignment of a judgment, fell out of it. This statement\r\nGen. Adams and the editor of the Republican have seized upon as a most\r\npalpable evidence of fabrication and falsehood. They set themselves\r\ngravely about proving that the assignment could not have been in the\r\ndeed when Talbott got it from young Adams, as he, Talbott, would have\r\nseen it when he opened the deed to correct the record. Now, the truth\r\nis, Talbott did see the assignment when he opened the deed, or at least\r\nhe told me he did on the same day; and I only omitted to say so, in\r\nmy former publication, because it was a matter of such palpable and\r\nnecessary inference. I had stated that Talbott had corrected the record\r\nby the deed; and of course he must have opened it; and, just as the\r\nGeneral and his friends argue, must have seen the assignment. I omitted\r\nto state the fact of Talbott's seeing the assignment, because its\r\nexistence was so necessarily connected with other facts which I did\r\nstate, that I thought the greatest dunce could not but understand\r\nit. Did I say Talbott had not seen it? Did I say anything that was\r\ninconsistent with his having seen it before? Most certainly I did\r\nneither; and if I did not, what becomes of the argument? These logical\r\ngentlemen can sustain their argument only by assuming that I did say\r\nnegatively everything that I did not say affirmatively; and upon the\r\nsame assumption, we may expect to find the General, if a little harder\r\npressed for argument, saying that I said Talbott came to our office with\r\nhis head downward, not that I actually said so, but because I omitted to\r\nsay he came feet downward.\r\n\r\nIn his publication to-day, the General produces the affidavit of Reuben\r\nRadford, in which it is said that Talbott told Radford that he did not\r\nfind the assignment in the deed, in the recording of which the error\r\nwas committed, but that he found it wrapped in another paper in the\r\nrecorder's office, upon which statement the Genl. comments as follows,\r\nto wit: \"If it be true as stated by Talbott to Radford, that he\r\nfound the assignment wrapped up in another paper at his office, that\r\ncontradicts the statement of Lincoln that it fell out of the deed.\"\r\n\r\nIs common sense to be abused with such sophistry? Did I say what Talbott\r\nfound it in? If Talbott did find it in another paper at his office, is\r\nthat any reason why he could not have folded it in a deed and brought\r\nit to my office? Can any one be so far duped as to be made believe that\r\nwhat may have happened at Talbot's office at one time is inconsistent\r\nwith what happened at my office at another time?\r\n\r\nNow Talbott's statement of the case as he makes it to me is this, that\r\nhe got a bunch of deeds from young Adams, and that he knows he found the\r\nassignment in the bunch, but he is not certain which particular deed it\r\nwas in, nor is he certain whether it was folded in the same deed out of\r\nwhich it was taken, or another one, when it was brought to my office. Is\r\nthis a mysterious story? Is there anything suspicious about it?\r\n\r\n\"But it is useless to dwell longer on this point. Any man who is not\r\nwilfully blind can see at a flash, that there is no discrepancy, and\r\nLincoln has shown that they are not only inconsistent with truth, but\r\neach other\"--I can only say, that I have shown that he has done no such\r\nthing; and if the reader is disposed to require any other evidence than\r\nthe General's assertion, he will be of my opinion.\r\n\r\nExcepting the General's most flimsy attempt at mystification, in regard\r\nto a discrepance between Talbott and myself, he has not denied a single\r\nstatement that I made in my hand-bill. Every material statement that\r\nI made has been sworn to by men who, in former times, were thought as\r\nrespectable as General Adams. I stated that an assignment of a judgment,\r\na copy of which I gave, had existed--Benj. Talbott, C. R. Matheny, Wm.\r\nButler, and Judge Logan swore to its existence. I stated that it was\r\nsaid to be in Gen. Adams's handwriting--the same men swore it was in\r\nhis handwriting. I stated that Talbott would swear that he got it out of\r\nGen. Adams's possession--Talbott came forward and did swear it.\r\n\r\nBidding adieu to the former publication, I now propose to examine the\r\nGeneral's last gigantic production. I now propose to point out some\r\ndiscrepancies in the General's address; and such, too, as he shall not\r\nbe able to escape from. Speaking of the famous assignment, the General\r\nsays: \"This last charge, which was their last resort, their dying\r\neffort to render my character infamous among my fellow citizens, was\r\nmanufactured at a certain lawyer's office in the town, printed at the\r\noffice of the Sangamon Journal, and found its way into the world some\r\ntime between two days just before the last election.\" Now turn to Mr.\r\nKeys' affidavit, in which you will find the following, viz.: \"I\r\ncertify that some time in May or the early part of June, 1837, I saw\r\nat Williams's corner a paper purporting to be an assignment from Joseph\r\nAnderson to James Adams, which assignment was signed by a mark to\r\nAnderson's name,\" etc. Now mark, if Keys saw the assignment on the last\r\nof May or first of June, Gen. Adams tells a falsehood when he says\r\nit was manufactured just before the election, which was on the 7th of\r\nAugust; and if it was manufactured just before the election, Keys tells\r\na falsehood when he says he saw it on the last of May or first of\r\nJune. Either Keys or the General is irretrievably in for it; and in the\r\nGeneral's very condescending language, I say \"Let them settle it between\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nNow again, let the reader, bearing in mind that General Adams has\r\nunequivocally said, in one part of his address, that the charge in\r\nrelation to the assignment was manufactured just before the election,\r\nturn to the affidavit of Peter S. Weber, where the following will be\r\nfound viz.: \"I, Peter S. Weber, do certify that from the best of\r\nmy recollection, on the day or day after Gen. Adams started for the\r\nIllinois Rapids, in May last, that I was at the house of Gen. Adams,\r\nsitting in the kitchen, situated on the back part of the house, it being\r\nin the afternoon, and that Benjamin Talbott came around the house, back\r\ninto the kitchen, and appeared wild and confused, and that he laid a\r\npackage of papers on the kitchen table and requested that they should be\r\nhanded to Lucian. He made no apology for coming to the kitchen, nor\r\nfor not handing them to Lucian himself, but showed the token of being\r\nfrightened and confused both in demeanor and speech and for what cause I\r\ncould not apprehend.\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on Weber's affidavit, Gen. Adams asks, \"Why this fright and\r\nconfusion?\" I reply that this is a question for the General himself.\r\nWeber says that it was in May, and if so, it is most clear that Talbott\r\nwas not frightened on account of the assignment, unless the General\r\nlies when he says the assignment charge was manufactured just before the\r\nelection. Is it not a strong evidence, that the General is not traveling\r\nwith the pole-star of truth in his front, to see him in one part of\r\nhis address roundly asserting that the assignment was manufactured\r\njust before the election, and then, forgetting that position, procuring\r\nWeber's most foolish affidavit, to prove that Talbott had been engaged\r\nin manufacturing it two months before?\r\n\r\nIn another part of his address, Gen. Adams says: \"That I hold an\r\nassignment of said judgment, dated the 20th of May, 1828, and signed\r\nby said Anderson, I have never pretended to deny or conceal, but stated\r\nthat fact in one of my circulars previous to the election, and also\r\nin answer to a bill in chancery.\" Now I pronounce this statement\r\nunqualifiedly false, and shall not rely on the word or oath of any\r\nman to sustain me in what I say; but will let the whole be decided by\r\nreference to the circular and answer in chancery of which the General\r\nspeaks. In his circular he did speak of an assignment; but he did not\r\nsay it bore date 20th of May, 1828; nor did he say it bore any date. In\r\nhis answer in chancery, he did say that he had an assignment; but he\r\ndid not say that it bore date the 20th May, 1828; but so far from it, he\r\nsaid on oath (for he swore to the answer) that as well as recollected,\r\nhe obtained it in 1827. If any one doubts, let him examine the circular\r\nand answer for himself. They are both accessible.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be observed that the principal part of Adams's defense\r\nrests upon the argument that if he had been base enough to forge an\r\nassignment he would not have been fool enough to forge one that would\r\nnot cover the case. This argument he used in his circular before the\r\nelection. The Republican has used it at least once, since then; and\r\nAdams uses it again in his publication of to-day. Now I pledge myself to\r\nshow that he is just such a fool that he and his friends have contended\r\nit was impossible for him to be. Recollect--he says he has a genuine\r\nassignment; and that he got Joseph Klein's affidavit, stating that he\r\nhad seen it, and that he believed the signature to have been executed\r\nby the same hand that signed Anderson's name to the answer in chancery.\r\nLuckily Klein took a copy of this genuine assignment, which I have been\r\npermitted to see; and hence I know it does not cover the case. In the\r\nfirst place it is headed \"Joseph Anderson vs. Joseph Miller,\" and heads\r\noff \"Judgment in Sangamon Circuit Court.\" Now, mark, there never was\r\na case in Sangamon Circuit Court entitled Joseph Anderson vs. Joseph\r\nMiller. The case mentioned in my former publication, and the only\r\none between these parties that ever existed in the Circuit Court, was\r\nentitled Joseph Miller vs. Joseph Anderson, Miller being the plaintiff.\r\nWhat then becomes of all their sophistry about Adams not being fool\r\nenough to forge an assignment that would not cover the case? It is\r\ncertain that the present one does not cover the case; and if he got\r\nit honestly, it is still clear that he was fool enough to pay for an\r\nassignment that does not cover the case.\r\n\r\nThe General asks for the proof of disinterested witnesses. Whom does he\r\nconsider disinterested? None can be more so than those who have already\r\ntestified against him. No one of them had the least interest on earth,\r\nso far as I can learn, to injure him. True, he says they had conspired\r\nagainst him; but if the testimony of an angel from Heaven were\r\nintroduced against him, he would make the same charge of conspiracy.\r\nAnd now I put the question to every reflecting man, Do you believe that\r\nBenjamin Talbott, Chas. R. Matheny, William Butler and Stephen T. Logan,\r\nall sustaining high and spotless characters, and justly proud of them,\r\nwould deliberately perjure themselves, without any motive whatever,\r\nexcept to injure a man's election; and that, too, a man who had been a\r\ncandidate, time out of mind, and yet who had never been elected to any\r\noffice?\r\n\r\nAdams's assurance, in demanding disinterested testimony, is surpassing.\r\nHe brings in the affidavit of his own son, and even of Peter S. Weber,\r\nwith whom I am not acquainted, but who, I suppose, is some black or\r\nmulatto boy, from his being kept in the kitchen, to prove his points;\r\nbut when such a man as Talbott, a man who, but two years ago, ran\r\nagainst Gen. Adams for the office of Recorder and beat him more than\r\nfour votes to one, is introduced against him, he asks the community,\r\nwith all the consequence of a lord, to reject his testimony.\r\n\r\nI might easily write a volume, pointing out inconsistencies between\r\nthe statements in Adams's last address with one another, and with other\r\nknown facts; but I am aware the reader must already be tired with\r\nthe length of this article. His opening statements, that he was first\r\naccused of being a Tory, and that he refuted that; that then the\r\nSampson's ghost story was got up, and he refuted that; that as a last\r\nresort, a dying effort, the assignment charge was got up is all as false\r\nas hell, as all this community must know. Sampson's ghost first made\r\nits appearance in print, and that, too, after Keys swears he saw the\r\nassignment, as any one may see by reference to the files of papers; and\r\nGen. Adams himself, in reply to the Sampson's ghost story, was the first\r\nman that raised the cry of toryism, and it was only by way of set-off,\r\nand never in seriousness, that it was bandied back at him. His effort is\r\nto make the impression that his enemies first made the charge of toryism\r\nand he drove them from that, then Sampson's ghost, he drove them from\r\nthat, then finally the assignment charge was manufactured just before\r\nelection. Now, the only general reply he ever made to the Sampson's\r\nghost and tory charges he made at one and the same time, and not in\r\nsuccession as he states; and the date of that reply will show, that it\r\nwas made at least a month after the date on which Keys swears he saw the\r\nAnderson assignment. But enough. In conclusion I will only say that I\r\nhave a character to defend as well as Gen. Adams, but I disdain to whine\r\nabout it as he does. It is true I have no children nor kitchen boys; and\r\nif I had, I should scorn to lug them in to make affidavits for me.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, September 6, 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGen. ADAMS CONTROVERSY--CONTINUED\r\n\r\nTO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\"SANGAMON JOURNAL,\" Springfield, Ill, Oct.28, 1837.\r\n\r\nSuch is the turn which things have taken lately, that when Gen. Adams\r\nwrites a book, I am expected to write a commentary on it. In the\r\nRepublican of this morning he has presented the world with a new work\r\nof six columns in length; in consequence of which I must beg the room of\r\none column in the Journal. It is obvious that a minute reply cannot\r\nbe made in one column to everything that can be said in six; and,\r\nconsequently, I hope that expectation will be answered if I reply to\r\nsuch parts of the General's publication as are worth replying to.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper to remind the reader that in his publication of\r\nSept. 6th General Adams said that the assignment charge was manufactured\r\njust before the election; and that in reply I proved that statement to\r\nbe false by Keys, his own witness. Now, without attempting to explain,\r\nhe furnishes me with another witness (Tinsley) by which the same thing\r\nis proved, to wit, that the assignment was not manufactured just before\r\nthe election; but that it was some weeks before. Let it be borne in mind\r\nthat Adams made this statement--has himself furnished two witnesses to\r\nprove its falsehood, and does not attempt to deny or explain it. Before\r\ngoing farther, let a pin be stuck here, labeled \"One lie proved and\r\nconfessed.\" On the 6th of September he said he had before stated in\r\nthe hand-bill that he held an assignment dated May 20th, 1828, which in\r\nreply I pronounced to be false, and referred to the hand-bill for the\r\ntruth of what I said. This week he forgets to make any explanation of\r\nthis. Let another pin be stuck here, labelled as before. I mention these\r\nthings because, if, when I convict him in one falsehood, he is permitted\r\nto shift his ground and pass it by in silence, there can be no end to\r\nthis controversy.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that attracts my attention in the General's present\r\nproduction is the information he is pleased to give to \"those who are\r\nmade to suffer at his (my) hands.\"\r\n\r\nUnder present circumstances, this cannot apply to me, for I am not\r\na widow nor an orphan: nor have I a wife or children who might by\r\npossibility become such. Such, however, I have no doubt, have been,\r\nand will again be made to suffer at his hands! Hands! Yes, they are\r\nthe mischievous agents. The next thing I shall notice is his favorite\r\nexpression, \"not of lawyers, doctors and others,\" which he is so fond of\r\napplying to all who dare expose his rascality. Now, let it be remembered\r\nthat when he first came to this country he attempted to impose himself\r\nupon the community as a lawyer, and actually carried the attempt so\r\nfar as to induce a man who was under a charge of murder to entrust the\r\ndefence of his life in his hands, and finally took his money and got\r\nhim hanged. Is this the man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by\r\nabusing lawyers? If he is not himself a lawyer, it is for the lack of\r\nsense, and not of inclination. If he is not a lawyer, he is a liar, for\r\nhe proclaimed himself a lawyer, and got a man hanged by depending on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPassing over such parts of the article as have neither fact nor argument\r\nin them, I come to the question asked by Adams whether any person ever\r\nsaw the assignment in his possession. This is an insult to common sense.\r\nTalbott has sworn once and repeated time and again, that he got it out\r\nof Adams's possession and returned it into the same possession. Still,\r\nas though he was addressing fools, he has assurance to ask if any person\r\never saw it in his possession.\r\n\r\nNext I quote a sentence, \"Now my son Lucian swears that when Talbott\r\ncalled for the deed, that he, Talbott, opened it and pointed out the\r\nerror.\" True. His son Lucian did swear as he says; and in doing so, he\r\nswore what I will prove by his own affidavit to be a falsehood. Turn to\r\nLucian's affidavit, and you will there see that Talbott called for the\r\ndeed by which to correct an error on the record. Thus it appears that\r\nthe error in question was on the record, and not in the deed. How then\r\ncould Talbott open the deed and point out the error? Where a thing is\r\nnot, it cannot be pointed out. The error was not in the deed, and of\r\ncourse could not be pointed out there. This does not merely prove that\r\nthe error could not be pointed out, as Lucian swore it was; but it\r\nproves, too, that the deed was not opened in his presence with a special\r\nview to the error, for if it had been, he could not have failed to see\r\nthat there was no error in it. It is easy enough to see why Lucian swore\r\nthis. His object was to prove that the assignment was not in the deed\r\nwhen Talbott got it: but it was discovered he could not swear this\r\nsafely, without first swearing the deed was opened--and if he swore it\r\nwas opened, he must show a motive for opening it, and the conclusion\r\nwith him and his father was that the pointing out the error would appear\r\nthe most plausible.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of showing that the assignment was not in the bundle\r\nwhen Talbott got it, is the story introduced into Lucian's affidavit\r\nthat the deeds were counted. It is a remarkable fact, and one that\r\nshould stand as a warning to all liars and fabricators, that in this\r\nshort affidavit of Lucian's he only attempted to depart from the truth,\r\nso far as I have the means of knowing, in two points, to wit, in the\r\nopening the deed and pointing out the error and the counting of the\r\ndeeds,--and in both of these he caught himself. About the counting, he\r\ncaught himself thus--after saying the bundle contained five deeds and\r\na lease, he proceeds, \"and I saw no other papers than the said deed and\r\nlease.\" First he has six papers, and then he saw none but two; for \"my\r\nson Lucian's\" benefit, let a pin be stuck here.\r\n\r\nAdams again adduces the argument, that he could not have forged the\r\nassignment, for the reason that he could have had no motive for it. With\r\nthose that know the facts there is no absence of motive. Admitting the\r\npaper which he has filed in the suit to be genuine, it is clear that it\r\ncannot answer the purpose for which he designs it. Hence his motive for\r\nmaking one that he supposed would answer is obvious. His making the date\r\ntoo old is also easily enough accounted for. The records were not in his\r\nhands, and then, there being some considerable talk upon this particular\r\nsubject, he knew he could not examine the records to ascertain the\r\nprecise dates without subjecting himself to suspicion; and hence he\r\nconcluded to try it by guess, and, as it turned out, missed it a little.\r\nAbout Miller's deposition I have a word to say. In the first place,\r\nMiller's answer to the first question shows upon its face that he had\r\nbeen tampered with, and the answer dictated to him. He was asked if he\r\nknew Joel Wright and James Adams; and above three-fourths of his answer\r\nconsists of what he knew about Joseph Anderson, a man about whom nothing\r\nhad been asked, nor a word said in the question--a fact that can only be\r\naccounted for upon the supposition that Adams had secretly told him what\r\nhe wished him to swear to.\r\n\r\nAnother of Miller's answers I will prove both by common sense and the\r\nCourt of Record is untrue. To one question he answers, \"Anderson brought\r\na suit against me before James Adams, then an acting justice of the\r\npeace in Sangamon County, before whom he obtained a judgment.\r\n\r\n\"Q.--Did you remove the same by injunction to the Sangamon Circuit\r\nCourt? Ans.--I did remove it.\"\r\n\r\nNow mark--it is said he removed it by injunction. The word \"injunction\"\r\nin common language imports a command that some person or thing shall\r\nnot move or be removed; in law it has the same meaning. An injunction\r\nissuing out of chancery to a justice of the peace is a command to him to\r\nstop all proceedings in a named case until further orders. It is not an\r\norder to remove but to stop or stay something that is already moving.\r\nBesides this, the records of the Sangamon Circuit Court show that the\r\njudgment of which Miller swore was never removed into said Court by\r\ninjunction or otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have now to take notice of a part of Adams's address which in the\r\norder of time should have been noticed before. It is in these words:\r\n\"I have now shown, in the opinion of two competent judges, that the\r\nhandwriting of the forged assignment differed from mine, and by one of\r\nthem that it could not be mistaken for mine.\" That is false. Tinsley no\r\ndoubt is the judge referred to; and by reference to his certificate it\r\nwill be seen that he did not say the handwriting of the assignment\r\ncould not be mistaken for Adams's--nor did he use any other expression\r\nsubstantially, or anything near substantially, the same. But if Tinsley\r\nhad said the handwriting could not be mistaken for Adams's, it would\r\nhave been equally unfortunate for Adams: for it then would have\r\ncontradicted Keys, who says, \"I looked at the writing and judged it the\r\nsaid Adams's or a good imitation.\"\r\n\r\nAdams speaks with much apparent confidence of his success on attending\r\nlawsuits, and the ultimate maintenance of his title to the land in\r\nquestion. Without wishing to disturb the pleasure of his dream, I would\r\nsay to him that it is not impossible that he may yet be taught to sing a\r\ndifferent song in relation to the matter.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Miller's deposition, Adams asks, \"Will Mr. Lincoln now say\r\nthat he is almost convinced my title to this ten acre tract of land\r\nis founded in fraud?\" I answer, I will not. I will now change the\r\nphraseology so as to make it run--I am quite convinced, &c. I cannot\r\npass in silence Adams's assertion that he has proved that the forged\r\nassignment was not in the deed when it came from his house by Talbott,\r\nthe recorder. In this, although Talbott has sworn that the assignment\r\nwas in the bundle of deeds when it came from his house, Adams has\r\nthe unaccountable assurance to say that he has proved the contrary by\r\nTalbott. Let him or his friends attempt to show wherein he proved any\r\nsuch thing by Talbott.\r\n\r\nIn his publication of the 6th of September he hinted to Talbott, that\r\nhe might be mistaken. In his present, speaking of Talbott and me he says\r\n\"They may have been imposed upon.\" Can any man of the least penetration\r\nfail to see the object of this? After he has stormed and raged till he\r\nhopes and imagines he has got us a little scared he wishes to softly\r\nwhisper in our ears, \"If you'll quit I will.\" If he could get us to say\r\nthat some unknown, undefined being had slipped the assignment into\r\nour hands without our knowledge, not a doubt remains but that he would\r\nimmediately discover that we were the purest men on earth. This is the\r\nground he evidently wishes us to understand he is willing to compromise\r\nupon. But we ask no such charity at his hands. We are neither mistaken\r\nnor imposed upon. We have made the statements we have because we know\r\nthem to be true and we choose to live or die by them.\r\n\r\nEsq. Carter, who is Adams's friend, personal and political, will\r\nrecollect, that, on the 5th of this month, he (Adams), with a great\r\naffectation of modesty, declared that he would never introduce his own\r\nchild as a witness. Notwithstanding this affectation of modesty, he has\r\nin his present publication introduced his child as witness; and as if to\r\nshow with how much contempt he could treat his own declaration, he\r\nhas had this same Esq. Carter to administer the oath to him. And so\r\nimportant a witness does he consider him, and so entirely does the whole\r\nof his entire present production depend upon the testimony of his child,\r\nthat in it he has mentioned \"my son,\" \"my son Lucian,\" \"Lucian, my son,\"\r\nand the like expressions no less than fifteen different times. Let it\r\nbe remembered here, that I have shown the affidavit of \"my darling son\r\nLucian\" to be false by the evidence apparent on its own face; and I now\r\nask if that affidavit be taken away what foundation will the fabric have\r\nleft to stand upon?\r\n\r\nGeneral Adams's publications and out-door maneuvering, taken in\r\nconnection with the editorial articles of the Republican, are not more\r\nfoolish and contradictory than they are ludicrous and amusing. One\r\nweek the Republican notifies the public that Gen. Adams is preparing\r\nan instrument that will tear, rend, split, rive, blow up, confound,\r\noverwhelm, annihilate, extinguish, exterminate, burst asunder, and grind\r\nto powder all its slanderers, and particularly Talbott and Lincoln--all\r\nof which is to be done in due time.\r\n\r\nThen for two or three weeks all is calm--not a word said. Again the\r\nRepublican comes forth with a mere passing remark that \"public\" opinion\r\nhas decided in favor of Gen. Adams, and intimates that he will give\r\nhimself no more trouble about the matter. In the meantime Adams himself\r\nis prowling about and, as Burns says of the devil, \"For prey, and holes\r\nand corners tryin',\" and in one instance goes so far as to take an old\r\nacquaintance of mine several steps from a crowd and, apparently weighed\r\ndown with the importance of his business, gravely and solemnly asks him\r\nif \"he ever heard Lincoln say he was a deist.\"\r\n\r\nAnon the Republican comes again. \"We invite the attention of the public\r\nto General Adams's communication,\" &c. \"The victory is a great one, the\r\ntriumph is overwhelming.\" I really believe the editor of the Illinois\r\nRepublican is fool enough to think General Adams leads off--\"Authors\r\nmost egregiously mistaken &c. Most woefully shall their presumption be\r\npunished,\" &c. (Lord have mercy on us.) \"The hour is yet to come, yea,\r\nnigh at hand--(how long first do you reckon?)--when the Journal and its\r\njunto shall say, I have appeared too early.\" \"Their infamy shall be laid\r\nbare to the public gaze.\" Suddenly the General appears to relent at the\r\nseverity with which he is treating us and he exclaims: \"The condemnation\r\nof my enemies is the inevitable result of my own defense.\" For your\r\nhealth's sake, dear Gen., do not permit your tenderness of heart to\r\nafflict you so much on our account. For some reason (perhaps because we\r\nare killed so quickly) we shall never be sensible of our suffering.\r\n\r\nFarewell, General. I will see you again at court if not before--when and\r\nwhere we will settle the question whether you or the widow shall have\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. October 18, 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1838\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Mrs. O. H. BROWNING--A FARCE\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, April 1, 1838.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM:--Without apologizing for being egotistical, I shall make the\r\nhistory of so much of my life as has elapsed since I saw you the subject\r\nof this letter. And, by the way, I now discover that, in order to give\r\na full and intelligible account of the things I have done and suffered\r\nsince I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that happened\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my\r\nacquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine, being about to pay a\r\nvisit to her father and other relatives residing in Kentucky, proposed\r\nto me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on\r\ncondition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all\r\nconvenient despatch. I, of course, accepted the proposal, for you know\r\nI could not have done otherwise had I really been averse to it; but\r\nprivately, between you and me, I was most confoundedly well pleased with\r\nthe project. I had seen the said sister some three years before, thought\r\nher intelligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to plodding\r\nlife through hand in hand with her. Time passed on; the lady took her\r\njourney and in due time returned, sister in company, sure enough. This\r\nastonished me a little, for it appeared to me that her coming so readily\r\nshowed that she was a trifle too willing, but on reflection it occurred\r\nto me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to\r\ncome without anything concerning me ever having been mentioned to her,\r\nand so I concluded that if no other objection presented itself, I would\r\nconsent to waive this. All this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival\r\nin the neighborhood--for, be it remembered, I had not yet seen her,\r\nexcept about three years previous, as above mentioned. In a few days we\r\nhad an interview, and, although I had seen her before, she did not look\r\nas my imagination had pictured her. I knew she was over-size, but she\r\nnow appeared a fair match for Falstaff. I knew she was called an\r\n\"old maid,\" and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the\r\nappellation, but now, when I beheld her, I could not for my life avoid\r\nthinking of my mother; and this, not from withered features,--for\r\nher skin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into\r\nwrinkles,--but from her want of teeth, weather-beaten appearance in\r\ngeneral, and from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing\r\ncould have commenced at the size of infancy and reached her present bulk\r\nin less than thirty-five or forty years; and in short, I was not at\r\nall pleased with her. But what could I do? I had told her sister that I\r\nwould take her for better or for worse, and I made a point of honor and\r\nconscience in all things to stick to my word especially if others had\r\nbeen induced to act on it which in this case I had no doubt they had,\r\nfor I was now fairly convinced that no other man on earth would have\r\nher, and hence the conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" thought I, \"I have said it, and, be the consequences what they\r\nmay, it shall not be my fault if I fail to do it.\" At once I determined\r\nto consider her my wife; and, this done, all my powers of discovery were\r\nput to work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set\r\noff against her defects. I tried to imagine her handsome, which, but\r\nfor her unfortunate corpulency, was actually true. Exclusive of this no\r\nwoman that I have ever seen has a finer face. I also tried to convince\r\nmyself that the mind was much more to be valued than the person; and in\r\nthis she was not inferior, as I could discover, to any with whom I had\r\nbeen acquainted.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, without coming to any positive understanding with\r\nher, I set out for Vandalia, when and where you first saw me. During\r\nmy stay there I had letters from her which did not change my opinion of\r\neither her intellect or intention, but on the contrary confirmed it in\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nAll this while, although I was fixed, \"firm as the surge-repelling\r\nrock,\" in my resolution, I found I was continually repenting the\r\nrashness which had led me to make it. Through life, I have been in no\r\nbondage, either real or imaginary, from the thraldom of which I so much\r\ndesired to be free. After my return home, I saw nothing to change my\r\nopinions of her in any particular. She was the same, and so was I. I now\r\nspent my time in planning how I might get along through life after my\r\ncontemplated change of circumstances should have taken place, and how I\r\nmight procrastinate the evil day for a time, which I really dreaded as\r\nmuch, perhaps more, than an Irishman does the halter.\r\n\r\nAfter all my suffering upon this deeply interesting subject, here I am,\r\nwholly, unexpectedly, completely, out of the \"scrape\"; and now I want to\r\nknow if you can guess how I got out of it----out, clear, in every sense\r\nof the term; no violation of word, honor, or conscience. I don't believe\r\nyou can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the lawyer\r\nsays, it was done in the manner following, to wit: After I had delayed\r\nthe matter as long as I thought I could in honor do (which, by the way,\r\nhad brought me round into the last fall), I concluded I might as well\r\nbring it to a consummation without further delay; and so I mustered\r\nmy resolution, and made the proposal to her direct; but, shocking to\r\nrelate, she answered, No. At first I supposed she did it through an\r\naffectation of modesty, which I thought but ill became her under the\r\npeculiar circumstances of her case; but on my renewal of the charge,\r\nI found she repelled it with greater firmness than before. I tried it\r\nagain and again but with the same success, or rather with the same want\r\nof success.\r\n\r\nI finally was forced to give it up; at which I very unexpectedly found\r\nmyself mortified almost beyond endurance. I was mortified, it seemed\r\nto me, in a hundred different ways. My vanity was deeply wounded by the\r\nreflection that I had been too stupid to discover her intentions, and at\r\nthe same time never doubting that I understood them perfectly, and also\r\nthat she, whom I had taught myself to believe nobody else would have,\r\nhad actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness. And, to cap the\r\nwhole, I then for the first time began to suspect that I was really a\r\nlittle in love with her. But let it all go. I'll try and outlive it.\r\nOthers have been made fools of by the girls, but this can never with\r\ntruth be said of me. I most emphatically in this instance, made a fool\r\nof myself. I have now come to the conclusion never again to think of\r\nmarrying, and for this reason: I can never be satisfied with any one who\r\nwould be blockhead enough to have me.\r\n\r\nWhen you receive this, write me a long yarn about something to amuse me.\r\nGive my respects to Mr. Browning.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1839\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON SALE OF PUBLIC LANDS\r\n\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, January 17, 1839.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, from Committee on Finance, to which the subject was\r\nreferred, made a report on the subject of purchasing of the United\r\nStates all the unsold lands lying within the limits of the State of\r\nIllinois, accompanied by resolutions that this State propose to purchase\r\nall unsold lands at twenty-five cents per acre, and pledging the faith\r\nof the State to carry the proposal into effect if the government accept\r\nthe same within two years.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln thought the resolutions ought to be seriously considered. In\r\nreply to the gentleman from Adams, he said that it was not to enrich the\r\nState. The price of the lands may be raised, it was thought by some; by\r\nothers, that it would be reduced. The conclusion in his mind was that\r\nthe representatives in this Legislature from the country in which\r\nthe lands lie would be opposed to raising the price, because it would\r\noperate against the settlement of the lands. He referred to the lands in\r\nthe military tract. They had fallen into the hands of large speculators\r\nin consequence of the low price. He was opposed to a low price of land.\r\nHe thought it was adverse to the interests of the poor settler, because\r\nspeculators buy them up. He was opposed to a reduction of the price of\r\npublic lands.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln referred to some official documents emanating from Indiana,\r\nand compared the progressive population of the two States. Illinois\r\nhad gained upon that State under the public land system as it is. His\r\nconclusion was that ten years from this time Illinois would have no more\r\npublic land unsold than Indiana now has. He referred also to Ohio. That\r\nState had sold nearly all her public lands. She was but twenty years\r\nahead of us, and as our lands were equally salable--more so, as he\r\nmaintained--we should have no more twenty years from now than she has at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln referred to the canal lands, and supposed that the policy of\r\nthe State would be different in regard to them, if the representatives\r\nfrom that section of country could themselves choose the policy; but the\r\nrepresentatives from other parts of the State had a veto upon it, and\r\nregulated the policy. He thought that if the State had all the lands,\r\nthe policy of the Legislature would be more liberal to all sections.\r\n\r\nHe referred to the policy of the General Government. He thought that\r\nif the national debt had not been paid, the expenses of the government\r\nwould not have doubled, as they had done since that debt was paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ------ ROW.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 11, 1839 DEAR ROW:\r\n\r\nMr. Redman informs me that you wish me to write you the particulars of\r\na conversation between Dr. Felix and myself relative to you. The Dr.\r\novertook me between Rushville and Beardstown.\r\n\r\nHe, after learning that I had lived at Springfield, asked if I was\r\nacquainted with you. I told him I was. He said you had lately been\r\nelected constable in Adams, but that you never would be again. I asked\r\nhim why. He said the people there had found out that you had been\r\nsheriff or deputy sheriff in Sangamon County, and that you came off and\r\nleft your securities to suffer. He then asked me if I did not know such\r\nto be the fact. I told him I did not think you had ever been sheriff or\r\ndeputy sheriff in Sangamon, but that I thought you had been constable. I\r\nfurther told him that if you had left your securities to suffer in that\r\nor any other case, I had never heard of it, and that if it had been so,\r\nI thought I would have heard of it.\r\n\r\nIf the Dr. is telling that I told him anything against you whatever, I\r\nauthorize you to contradict it flatly. We have no news here.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON NATIONAL BANK\r\n\r\nIN THE HALL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 20, 1839.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--It is peculiarly embarrassing to me to attempt a\r\ncontinuance of the discussion, on this evening, which has been conducted\r\nin this hall on several preceding ones. It is so because on each of\r\nthose evenings there was a much fuller attendance than now, without any\r\nreason for its being so, except the greater interest the community feel\r\nin the speakers who addressed them then than they do in him who is to do\r\nso now. I am, indeed, apprehensive that the few who have attended\r\nhave done so more to spare me mortification than in the hope of being\r\ninterested in anything I may be able to say. This circumstance casts\r\na damp upon my spirits, which I am sure I shall be unable to overcome\r\nduring the evening. But enough of preface.\r\n\r\nThe subject heretofore and now to be discussed is the subtreasury scheme\r\nof the present administration, as a means of collecting, safe-keeping,\r\ntransferring, and disbursing, the revenues of the nation, as contrasted\r\nwith a national bank for the same purposes. Mr. Douglas has said that we\r\n(the Whigs) have not dared to meet them (the Locos) in argument on this\r\nquestion. I protest against this assertion. I assert that we have again\r\nand again, during this discussion, urged facts and arguments against\r\nthe subtreasury which they have neither dared to deny nor attempted to\r\nanswer. But lest some may be led to believe that we really wish to avoid\r\nthe question, I now propose, in my humble way, to urge those arguments\r\nagain; at the same time begging the audience to mark well the positions\r\nI shall take and the proof I shall offer to sustain them, and that they\r\nwill not again permit Mr. Douglas or his friends to escape the force of\r\nthem by a round and groundless assertion that we \"dare not meet them in\r\nargument.\"\r\n\r\nOf the subtreasury, then, as contrasted with a national bank for the\r\nbefore-enumerated purposes, I lay down the following propositions, to\r\nwit: (1) It will injuriously affect the community by its operation on\r\nthe circulating medium. (2) It will be a more expensive fiscal agent.\r\n(3) It will be a less secure depository of the public money. To show\r\nthe truth of the first proposition, let us take a short review of our\r\ncondition under the operation of a national bank. It was the depository\r\nof the public revenues. Between the collection of those revenues and the\r\ndisbursement of them by the government, the bank was permitted to and\r\ndid actually loan them out to individuals, and hence the large amount of\r\nmoney actually collected for revenue purposes, which by any other\r\nplan would have been idle a great portion of the time, was kept almost\r\nconstantly in circulation. Any person who will reflect that money is\r\nonly valuable while in circulation will readily perceive that any device\r\nwhich will keep the government revenues in constant circulation, instead\r\nof being locked up in idleness, is no inconsiderable advantage. By the\r\nsubtreasury the revenue is to be collected and kept in iron boxes until\r\nthe government wants it for disbursement; thus robbing the people of the\r\nuse of it, while the government does not itself need it, and while the\r\nmoney is performing no nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes.\r\nThe natural effect of this change of policy, every one will see, is\r\nto reduce the quantity of money in circulation. But, again, by\r\nthe subtreasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie. I\r\nanticipate that this will be disputed. I expect to hear it said that\r\nit is not the policy of the administration to collect the revenue\r\nin specie. If it shall, I reply that Mr. Van Buren, in his message\r\nrecommending the subtreasury, expended nearly a column of that document\r\nin an attempt to persuade Congress to provide for the collection of the\r\nrevenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes with these words:\r\n\r\n\"It may be safely assumed that no motive of convenience to the citizens\r\nrequires the reception of bank paper.\" In addition to this, Mr.\r\nSilas Wright, Senator from New York, and the political, personal and\r\nconfidential friend of Mr. Van Buren, drafted and introduced into the\r\nSenate the first subtreasury bill, and that bill provided for ultimately\r\ncollecting the revenue in specie. It is true, I know, that that clause\r\nwas stricken from the bill, but it was done by the votes of the Whigs,\r\naided by a portion only of the Van Buren senators. No subtreasury\r\nbill has yet become a law, though two or three have been considered by\r\nCongress, some with and some without the specie clause; so that I\r\nadmit there is room for quibbling upon the question of whether the\r\nadministration favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not; but I take it\r\nthat the fact that the President at first urged the specie doctrine,\r\nand that under his recommendation the first bill introduced embraced it,\r\nwarrants us in charging it as the policy of the party until their head\r\nas publicly recants it as he at first espoused it. I repeat, then, that\r\nby the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected in specie. Now mark\r\nwhat the effect of this must be. By all estimates ever made there are\r\nbut between sixty and eighty millions of specie in the United States.\r\nThe expenditures of the Government for the year 1838--the last for which\r\nwe have had the report--were forty millions. Thus it is seen that if the\r\nwhole revenue be collected in specie, it will take more than half of all\r\nthe specie in the nation to do it. By this means more than half of all\r\nthe specie belonging to the fifteen millions of souls who compose the\r\nwhole population of the country is thrown into the hands of the public\r\noffice-holders, and other public creditors comprising in number perhaps\r\nnot more than one quarter of a million, leaving the other fourteen\r\nmillions and three quarters to get along as they best can, with less\r\nthan one half of the specie of the country, and whatever rags and\r\nshinplasters they may be able to put, and keep, in circulation. By\r\nthis means, every office-holder and other public creditor may, and\r\nmost likely will, set up shaver; and a most glorious harvest will the\r\nspecie-men have of it,--each specie-man, upon a fair division, having to\r\nhis share the fleecing of about fifty-nine rag-men. In all candor let me\r\nask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many\r\never before devised? And was the sacred name of Democracy ever before\r\nmade to indorse such an enormity against the rights of the people?\r\n\r\nI have already said that the subtreasury will reduce the quantity of\r\nmoney in circulation. This position is strengthened by the recollection\r\nthat the revenue is to be collected in Specie, so that the mere amount\r\nof revenue is not all that is withdrawn, but the amount of paper\r\ncirculation that the forty millions would serve as a basis to is\r\nwithdrawn, which would be in a sound state at least one hundred\r\nmillions. When one hundred millions, or more, of the circulation we\r\nnow have shall be withdrawn, who can contemplate without terror the\r\ndistress, ruin, bankruptcy, and beggary that must follow? The man\r\nwho has purchased any article--say a horse--on credit, at one hundred\r\ndollars, when there are two hundred millions circulating in the country,\r\nif the quantity be reduced to one hundred millions by the arrival of\r\npay-day, will find the horse but sufficient to pay half the debt; and\r\nthe other half must either be paid out of his other means, and thereby\r\nbecome a clear loss to him, or go unpaid, and thereby become a clear\r\nloss to his creditor. What I have here said of a single case of the\r\npurchase of a horse will hold good in every case of a debt existing at\r\nthe time a reduction in the quantity of money occurs, by whomsoever, and\r\nfor whatsoever, it may have been contracted. It may be said that\r\nwhat the debtor loses the creditor gains by this operation; but on\r\nexamination this will be found true only to a very limited extent. It is\r\nmore generally true that all lose by it--the creditor by losing more of\r\nhis debts than he gains by the increased value of those he collects; the\r\ndebtor by either parting with more of his property to pay his debts\r\nthan he received in contracting them, or by entirely breaking up his\r\nbusiness, and thereby being thrown upon the world in idleness.\r\n\r\nThe general distress thus created will, to be sure, be temporary,\r\nbecause, whatever change may occur in the quantity of money in any\r\ncommunity, time will adjust the derangement produced; but while that\r\nadjustment is progressing, all suffer more or less, and very many lose\r\neverything that renders life desirable. Why, then, shall we suffer a\r\nsevere difficulty, even though it be but temporary, unless we receive\r\nsome equivalent for it?\r\n\r\nWhat I have been saying as to the effect produced by a reduction of the\r\nquantity of money relates to the whole country. I now propose to\r\nshow that it would produce a peculiar and permanent hardship upon the\r\ncitizens of those States and Territories in which the public lands lie.\r\nThe land-offices in those States and Territories, as all know, form the\r\ngreat gulf by which all, or nearly all, the money in them is swallowed\r\nup. When the quantity of money shall be reduced, and consequently\r\neverything under individual control brought down in proportion, the\r\nprice of those lands, being fixed by law, will remain as now. Of\r\nnecessity it will follow that the produce or labor that now raises money\r\nsufficient to purchase eighty acres will then raise but sufficient\r\nto purchase forty, or perhaps not that much; and this difficulty and\r\nhardship will last as long, in some degree, as any portion of these\r\nlands shall remain undisposed of. Knowing, as I well do, the difficulty\r\nthat poor people now encounter in procuring homes, I hesitate not to say\r\nthat when the price of the public lands shall be doubled or trebled, or,\r\nwhich is the same thing, produce and labor cut down to one half or one\r\nthird of their present prices, it will be little less than impossible\r\nfor them to procure those homes at all....\r\n\r\nWell, then, what did become of him? (Postmaster General Barry) Why, the\r\nPresident immediately expressed his high disapprobation of his almost\r\nunequaled incapacity and corruption by appointing him to a foreign\r\nmission, with a salary and outfit of $18,000 a year! The party now\r\nattempt to throw Barry off, and to avoid the responsibility of his sins.\r\nDid not the President indorse those sins when, on the very heel of\r\ntheir commission, he appointed their author to the very highest and most\r\nhonorable office in his gift, and which is but a single step behind the\r\nvery goal of American political ambition?\r\n\r\nI return to another of Mr. Douglas's excuses for the expenditures of\r\n1838, at the same time announcing the pleasing intelligence that this is\r\nthe last one. He says that ten millions of that year's expenditure was\r\na contingent appropriation, to prosecute an anticipated war with Great\r\nBritain on the Maine boundary question. Few words will settle this.\r\nFirst, that the ten millions appropriated was not made till 1839, and\r\nconsequently could not have been expended in 1838; second, although it\r\nwas appropriated, it has never been expended at all. Those who heard Mr.\r\nDouglas recollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression\r\nof pity for me. \"Now he's got me,\" thought I. But when he went on to\r\nsay that five millions of the expenditure of 1838 were payments of the\r\nFrench indemnities, which I knew to be untrue; that five millions had\r\nbeen for the post-office, which I knew to be untrue; that ten millions\r\nhad been for the Maine boundary war, which I not only knew to be untrue,\r\nbut supremely ridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough\r\nto hope that I would permit such groundless and audacious assertions to\r\ngo unexposed,--I readily consented that, on the score both of veracity\r\nand sagacity, the audience should judge whether he or I were the more\r\ndeserving of the world's contempt.\r\n\r\nMr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party and\r\nthe Whigs is that, although the former sometimes err in practice,\r\nthey are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in\r\nprinciple; and, better to impress this proposition, he uses a figurative\r\nexpression in these words: \"The Democrats are vulnerable in the heel,\r\nbut they are sound in the head and the heart.\" The first branch of the\r\nfigure--that is, that the Democrats are vulnerable in the heel--I admit\r\nis not merely figuratively, but literally true. Who that looks but for\r\na moment at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their Harringtons, and their\r\nhundreds of others, scampering away with the public money to Texas, to\r\nEurope, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find\r\nrefuge from justice, can at all doubt that they are most distressingly\r\naffected in their heels with a species of \"running itch\"? It seems\r\nthat this malady of their heels operates on these sound-headed and\r\nhonest-hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in the comic song\r\ndid on its owner: which, when he had once got started on it, the more he\r\ntried to stop it, the more it would run away. At the hazard of wearing\r\nthis point threadbare, I will relate an anecdote which seems too\r\nstrikingly in point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier, who was always\r\nboasting of his bravery when no danger was near, but who invariably\r\nretreated without orders at the first charge of an engagement, being\r\nasked by his captain why he did so, replied: \"Captain, I have as brave a\r\nheart as Julius Caesar ever had; but, somehow or other, whenever\r\ndanger approaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it.\" So with Mr.\r\nLamborn's party. They take the public money into their hand for the\r\nmost laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can dictate; but\r\nbefore they can possibly get it out again, their rascally \"vulnerable\r\nheels\" will run away with them.\r\n\r\nSeriously this proposition of Mr. Lamborn is nothing more or less than\r\na request that his party may be tried by their professions instead of\r\ntheir practices. Perhaps no position that the party assumes is more\r\nliable to or more deserving of exposure than this very modest request;\r\nand nothing but the unwarrantable length to which I have already\r\nextended these remarks forbids me now attempting to expose it. For the\r\nreason given, I pass it by.\r\n\r\nI shall advert to but one more point. Mr. Lamborn refers to the late\r\nelections in the States, and from their results confidently predicts\r\nthat every State in the Union will vote for Mr. Van Buren at the next\r\nPresidential election. Address that argument to cowards and to knaves;\r\nwith the free and the brave it will effect nothing. It may be true; if\r\nit must, let it. Many free countries have lost their liberty, and ours\r\nmay lose hers; but if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that I was\r\nthe last to desert, but that I never deserted her. I know that the great\r\nvolcano at Washington, aroused and directed by the evil spirit that\r\nreigns there, is belching forth the lava of political corruption in a\r\ncurrent broad and deep, which is sweeping with frightful velocity\r\nover the whole length and breadth of the land, bidding fair to leave\r\nunscathed no green spot or living thing; while on its bosom are riding,\r\nlike demons on the waves of hell, the imps of that evil spirit, and\r\nfiendishly taunting all those who dare resist its destroying course with\r\nthe hopelessness of their effort; and, knowing this, I cannot deny that\r\nall may be swept away. Broken by it I, too, may be; bow to it I never\r\nwill. The probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to\r\ndeter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just; it shall not\r\ndeter me. If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those\r\ndimensions not wholly unworthy of its almighty Architect, it is when I\r\ncontemplate the cause of my country deserted by all the world beside,\r\nand I standing up boldly and alone, and hurling defiance at her\r\nvictorious oppressors. Here, without contemplating consequences, before\r\nhigh heaven and in the face of the world, I swear eternal fidelity to\r\nthe just cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty, and\r\nmy love. And who that thinks with me will not fearlessly adopt the oath\r\nthat I take? Let none falter who thinks he is right, and we may succeed.\r\nBut if, after all, we shall fail, be it so. We still shall have the\r\nproud consolation of saying to our consciences, and to the departed\r\nshade of our country's freedom, that the cause approved of our judgment,\r\nand adored of our hearts, in disaster, in chains, in torture, in death,\r\nwe never faltered in defending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN T. STUART.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, December 23, 1839.\r\n\r\nDEAR STUART:\r\n\r\nDr. Henry will write you all the political news. I write this about some\r\nlittle matters of business. You recollect you told me you had drawn the\r\nChicago Masark money, and sent it to the claimants. A hawk-billed Yankee\r\nis here besetting me at every turn I take, saying that Robert Kinzie\r\nnever received the eighty dollars to which he was entitled. Can you tell\r\nme anything about the matter? Again, old Mr. Wright, who lives up South\r\nFork somewhere, is teasing me continually about some deeds which he says\r\nhe left with you, but which I can find nothing of. Can you tell me where\r\nthey are? The Legislature is in session and has suffered the bank to\r\nforfeit its charter without benefit of clergy. There seems to be little\r\ndisposition to resuscitate it.\r\n\r\nWhenever a letter comes from you to Mrs.____________ I carry it to her,\r\nand then I see Betty; she is a tolerable nice \"fellow\" now. Maybe I will\r\nwrite again when I get more time.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever, A. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nP. S.--The Democratic giant is here, but he is not much worth talking\r\nabout. A.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1840\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR FROM WHIG COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nConfidential.\r\n\r\nJanuary [1?], 1840.\r\n\r\nTo MESSRS ------\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--In obedience to a resolution of the Whig State convention,\r\nwe have appointed you the Central Whig Committee of your county. The\r\ntrust confided to you will be one of watchfulness and labor; but we hope\r\nthe glory of having contributed to the overthrow of the corrupt powers\r\nthat now control our beloved country will be a sufficient reward for the\r\ntime and labor you will devote to it. Our Whig brethren throughout the\r\nUnion have met in convention, and after due deliberation and\r\nmutual concessions have elected candidates for the Presidency and\r\nVice-Presidency not only worthy of our cause, but worthy of the support\r\nof every true patriot who would have our country redeemed, and her\r\ninstitutions honestly and faithfully administered. To overthrow the\r\ntrained bands that are opposed to us whose salaried officers are ever\r\non the watch, and whose misguided followers are ever ready to obey their\r\nsmallest commands, every Whig must not only know his duty, but must\r\nfirmly resolve, whatever of time and labor it may cost, boldly and\r\nfaithfully to do it. Our intention is to organize the whole State, so\r\nthat every Whig can be brought to the polls in the coming Presidential\r\ncontest. We cannot do this, however, without your co-operation; and\r\nas we do our duty, so we shall expect you to do yours. After due\r\ndeliberation, the following is the plan of organization, and the duties\r\nrequired of each county committee:\r\n\r\n(1) To divide their county into small districts, and to appoint in each\r\na subcommittee, whose duty it shall be to make a perfect list of all the\r\nvoters in their respective districts, and to ascertain with certainty\r\nfor whom they will vote. If they meet with men who are doubtful as to\r\nthe man they will support, such voters should be designated in separate\r\nlines, with the name of the man they will probably support.\r\n\r\n(2) It will be the duty of said subcommittee to keep a constant watch on\r\nthe doubtful voters, and from time to time have them talked to by those\r\nin whom they have the most confidence, and also to place in their hands\r\nsuch documents as will enlighten and influence them.\r\n\r\n(3) It will also be their duty to report to you, at least once a month,\r\nthe progress they are making, and on election days see that every Whig\r\nis brought to the polls.\r\n\r\n(4) The subcommittees should be appointed immediately; and by the last\r\nof April, at least, they should make their first report.\r\n\r\n(5) On the first of each month hereafter we shall expect to hear from\r\nyou. After the first report of your subcommittees, unless there should\r\nbe found a great many doubtful voters, you can tell pretty accurately\r\nthe manner in which your county will vote. In each of your letters to\r\nus, you will state the number of certain votes both for and against us,\r\nas well as the number of doubtful votes, with your opinion of the manner\r\nin which they will be cast.\r\n\r\n(6) When we have heard from all the counties, we shall be able to\r\ntell with similar accuracy the political complexion of the State. This\r\ninformation will be forwarded to you as soon as received.\r\n\r\n(7) Inclosed is a prospectus for a newspaper to be continued until after\r\nthe Presidential election. It will be superintended by ourselves, and\r\nevery Whig in the State must take it. It will be published so low that\r\nevery one can afford it. You must raise a fund and forward us for extra\r\ncopies,--every county ought to send--fifty or one hundred dollars,--and\r\nthe copies will be forwarded to you for distribution among our political\r\nopponents. The paper will be devoted exclusively to the great cause\r\nin which we are engaged. Procure subscriptions, and forward them to us\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n(8) Immediately after any election in your county, you must inform us of\r\nits results; and as early as possible after any general election we will\r\ngive you the like information.\r\n\r\n(9) A senator in Congress is to be elected by our next Legislature. Let\r\nno local interests divide you, but select candidates that can succeed.\r\n\r\n(10) Our plan of operations will of course be concealed from every one\r\nexcept our good friends who of right ought to know them.\r\n\r\nTrusting much in our good cause, the strength of our candidates, and\r\nthe determination of the Whigs everywhere to do their duty, we go to\r\nthe work of organization in this State confident of success. We have\r\nthe numbers, and if properly organized and exerted, with the gallant\r\nHarrison at our head, we shall meet our foes and conquer them in all\r\nparts of the Union.\r\n\r\nAddress your letters to Dr. A. G. Henry, R. F, Barrett; A. Lincoln, E.\r\nD. Baker, J. F. Speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN T. STUART.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 1, 1840\r\n\r\nDEAR STUART:\r\n\r\nI have never seen the prospects of our party so bright in these parts\r\nas they are now. We shall carry this county by a larger majority than\r\nwe did in 1836, when you ran against May. I do not think my prospects,\r\nindividually, are very flattering, for I think it probable I shall\r\nnot be permitted to be a candidate; but the party ticket will succeed\r\ntriumphantly. Subscriptions to the \"Old Soldier\" pour in without\r\nabatement. This morning I took from the post office a letter from Dubois\r\nenclosing the names of sixty subscribers, and on carrying it to Francis\r\nI found he had received one hundred and forty more from other quarters\r\nby the same day's mail. That is but an average specimen of every day's\r\nreceipts. Yesterday Douglas, having chosen to consider himself insulted\r\nby something in the Journal, undertook to cane Francis in the street.\r\nFrancis caught him by the hair and jammed him back against a market cart\r\nwhere the matter ended by Francis being pulled away from him. The\r\nwhole affair was so ludicrous that Francis and everybody else (Douglass\r\nexcepted) have been laughing about it ever since.\r\n\r\nI send you the names of some of the V.B. men who have come out for\r\nHarrison about town, and suggest that you send them some documents.\r\n\r\nMoses Coffman (he let us appoint him a delegate yesterday), Aaron\r\nCoffman, George Gregory, H. M.

LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nNovember 28, 1840.\r\n\r\nIn the Illinois House of Representatives, November 28, 1840, Mr. Lincoln\r\noffered the following:\r\n\r\nResolved, That so much of the governor's message as relates to\r\nfraudulent voting, and other fraudulent practices at elections, be\r\nreferred to the Committee on Elections, with instructions to said\r\ncommittee to prepare and report to the House a bill for such an act as\r\nmay in their judgment afford the greatest possible protection of the\r\nelective franchise against all frauds of all sorts whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nDecember 2, 1840.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Committee on Education be instructed to inquire\r\ninto the expediency of providing by law for the examination as to the\r\nqualification of persons offering themselves as school teachers, that no\r\nteacher shall receive any part of the public school fund who shall not\r\nhave successfully passed such examination, and that they report by bill\r\nor otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nDecember 4, 1840\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, Illinois, December 4, 1840, on\r\npresentation of a report respecting petition of H. N. Purple, claiming\r\nthe seat of Mr. Phelps from Peoria, Mr. Lincoln moved that the House\r\nresolve itself into Committee of the Whole on the question, and take\r\nit up immediately. Mr. Lincoln considered the question of the highest\r\nimportance whether an individual had a right to sit in this House or\r\nnot. The course he should propose would be to take up the evidence and\r\ndecide upon the facts seriatim.\r\n\r\nMr. Drummond wanted time; they could not decide in the heat of debate,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln thought that the question had better be gone into now.\r\nIn courts of law jurors were required to decide on evidence, without\r\nprevious study or examination. They were required to know nothing of\r\nthe subject until the evidence was laid before them for their immediate\r\ndecision. He thought that the heat of party would be augmented by delay.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker called Mr. Lincoln to order as being irrelevant; no mention\r\nhad been made of party heat.\r\n\r\nMr. Drummond said he had only spoken of debate. Mr. Lincoln asked what\r\ncaused the heat, if it was not party? Mr. Lincoln concluded by urging\r\nthat the question would be decided now better than hereafter, and he\r\nthought with less heat and excitement.\r\n\r\n(Further debate, in which Lincoln participated.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nDecember 4, 1840.\r\n\r\nIn the Illinois House of Representatives, December 4, 1840, House in\r\nCommittee of the Whole on the bill providing for payment of interest on\r\nthe State debt,--Mr. Lincoln moved to strike out the body and amendments\r\nof the bill, and insert in lieu thereof an amendment which in substance\r\nwas that the governor be authorized to issue bonds for the payment of\r\nthe interest; that these be called \"interest bonds\"; that the taxes\r\naccruing on Congress lands as they become taxable be irrevocably set\r\naside and devoted as a fund to the payment of the interest bonds. Mr.\r\nLincoln went into the reasons which appeared to him to render this plan\r\npreferable to that of hypothecating the State bonds. By this course we\r\ncould get along till the next meeting of the Legislature, which was\r\nof great importance. To the objection which might be urged that these\r\ninterest bonds could not be cashed, he replied that if our other bonds\r\ncould, much more could these, which offered a perfect security, a fund\r\nbeing irrevocably set aside to provide for their redemption. To another\r\nobjection, that we should be paying compound interest, he would reply\r\nthat the rapid growth and increase of our resources was in so great a\r\nratio as to outstrip the difficulty; that his object was to do the best\r\nthat could be done in the present emergency. All agreed that the faith\r\nof the State must be preserved; this plan appeared to him preferable\r\nto a hypothecation of bonds, which would have to be redeemed and the\r\ninterest paid. How this was to be done, he could not see; therefore he\r\nhad, after turning the matter over in every way, devised this measure,\r\nwhich would carry us on till the next Legislature.\r\n\r\n(Mr. Lincoln spoke at some length, advocating his measure.)\r\n\r\nLincoln advocated his measure, December 11, 1840.\r\n\r\nDecember 12, 1840, he had thought some permanent provision ought to be\r\nmade for the bonds to be hypothecated, but was satisfied taxation and\r\nrevenue could not be connected with it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1841\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN T. STUART--ON DEPRESSION\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan 23, 1841\r\n\r\nDEAR STUART: I am now the most miserable man living. If what I feel were\r\nequally distributed to the whole human family, there would not be one\r\ncheerful face on earth. Whether I shall ever be better, I cannot tell; I\r\nawfully forbode I shall not. To remain as I am is impossible. I must die\r\nor be better, as it appears to me.... I fear I shall be unable to attend\r\nany business here, and a change of scene might help me. If I could be\r\nmyself, I would rather remain at home with Judge Logan. I can write no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nJanuary 23, 1841\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives January 23, 1841, while discussing the\r\ncontinuation of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, Mr. Moore was afraid\r\nthe holders of the \"scrip\" would lose.\r\n\r\nMr. Napier thought there was no danger of that; and Mr. Lincoln said he\r\nhad not examined to see what amount of scrip would probably be needed.\r\nThe principal point in his mind was this, that nobody was obliged to\r\ntake these certificates. It is altogether voluntary on their part, and\r\nif they apprehend it will fall in their hands they will not take it.\r\nFurther the loss, if any there be, will fall on the citizens of that\r\nsection of the country.\r\n\r\nThis scrip is not going to circulate over an extensive range of country,\r\nbut will be confined chiefly to the vicinity of the canal. Now, we find\r\nthe representatives of that section of the country are all in favor of\r\nthe bill.\r\n\r\nWhen we propose to protect their interests, they say to us: Leave us\r\nto take care of ourselves; we are willing to run the risk. And this\r\nis reasonable; we must suppose they are competent to protect their own\r\ninterests, and it is only fair to let them do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR FROM WHIG COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nFebruary 9, 1841.\r\n\r\nAppeal to the People of the State of Illinois.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--When the General Assembly, now about adjourning,\r\nassembled in November last, from the bankrupt state of the public\r\ntreasury, the pecuniary embarrassments prevailing in every department\r\nof society, the dilapidated state of the public works, and the impending\r\ndanger of the degradation of the State, you had a right to expect\r\nthat your representatives would lose no time in devising and adopting\r\nmeasures to avert threatened calamities, alleviate the distresses of\r\nthe people, and allay the fearful apprehensions in regard to the future\r\nprosperity of the State. It was not expected by you that the spirit of\r\nparty would take the lead in the councils of the State, and make every\r\ninterest bend to its demands. Nor was it expected that any party would\r\nassume to itself the entire control of legislation, and convert the\r\nmeans and offices of the State, and the substance of the people, into\r\naliment for party subsistence. Neither could it have been expected by\r\nyou that party spirit, however strong its desires and unreasonable\r\nits demands, would have passed the sanctuary of the Constitution, and\r\nentered with its unhallowed and hideous form into the formation of the\r\njudiciary system.\r\n\r\nAt the early period of the session, measures were adopted by the\r\ndominant party to take possession of the State, to fill all public\r\noffices with party men, and make every measure affecting the interests\r\nof the people and the credit of the State operate in furtherance of\r\ntheir party views. The merits of men and measures therefore became the\r\nsubject of discussion in caucus, instead of the halls of legislation,\r\nand decisions there made by a minority of the Legislature have been\r\nexecuted and carried into effect by the force of party discipline,\r\nwithout any regard whatever to the rights of the people or the interests\r\nof the State. The Supreme Court of the State was organized, and judges\r\nappointed, according to the provisions of the Constitution, in 1824.\r\nThe people have never complained of the organization of that court; no\r\nattempt has ever before been made to change that department. Respect for\r\npublic opinion, and regard for the rights and liberties of the people,\r\nhave hitherto restrained the spirit of party from attacks upon the\r\nindependence and integrity of the judiciary. The same judges have\r\ncontinued in office since 1824; their decisions have not been the\r\nsubject of complaint among the people; the integrity and honesty of the\r\ncourt have not been questioned, and it has never been supposed that\r\nthe court has ever permitted party prejudice or party considerations\r\nto operate upon their decisions. The court was made to consist of four\r\njudges, and by the Constitution two form a quorum for the transaction\r\nof business. With this tribunal, thus constituted, the people have\r\nbeen satisfied for near sixteen years. The same law which organized the\r\nSupreme Court in 1824 also established and organized circuit courts\r\nto be held in each county in the State, and five circuit judges were\r\nappointed to hold those courts. In 1826 the Legislature abolished these\r\ncircuit courts, repealed the judges out of office, and required the\r\njudges of the Supreme Court to hold the circuit courts. The reasons\r\nassigned for this change were, first, that the business of the country\r\ncould be better attended to by the four judges of the Supreme Court than\r\nby the two sets of judges; and, second, the state of the public treasury\r\nforbade the employment of unnecessary officers. In 1828 a circuit was\r\nestablished north of the Illinois River, in order to meet the wants of\r\nthe people, and a circuit judge was appointed to hold the courts in that\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 the circuit-court system was again established throughout the\r\nState, circuit judges appointed to hold the courts, and the judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court were relieved from the performance of circuit court\r\nduties. The change was recommended by the then acting governor of the\r\nState, General W. L. D. Ewing, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"The augmented population of the State, the multiplied number of\r\norganized counties, as well as the increase of business in all, has\r\nlong since convinced every one conversant with this department of\r\nour government of the indispensable necessity of an alteration in\r\nour judiciary system, and the subject is therefore recommended to the\r\nearnest patriotic consideration of the Legislature. The present system\r\nhas never been exempt from serious and weighty objections. The idea of\r\nappealing from the circuit court to the same judges in the Supreme Court\r\nis recommended by little hopes of redress to the injured party below.\r\nThe duties of the circuit, too, it may be added, consume one half of the\r\nyear, leaving a small and inadequate portion of time (when that required\r\nfor domestic purposes is deducted) to erect, in the decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court, a judicial monument of legal learning and research,\r\nwhich the talent and ability of the court might otherwise be entirely\r\ncompetent to.\"\r\n\r\nWith this organization of circuit courts the people have never\r\ncomplained. The only complaints which we have heard have come from\r\ncircuits which were so large that the judges could not dispose of the\r\nbusiness, and the circuits in which Judges Pearson and Ralston lately\r\npresided.\r\n\r\nWhilst the honor and credit of the State demanded legislation upon the\r\nsubject of the public debt, the canal, the unfinished public works, and\r\nthe embarrassments of the people, the judiciary stood upon a basis\r\nwhich required no change--no legislative action. Yet the party in power,\r\nneglecting every interest requiring legislative action, and wholly\r\ndisregarding the rights, wishes, and interests of the people, has, for\r\nthe unholy purpose of providing places for its partisans and supplying\r\nthem with large salaries, disorganized that department of the\r\ngovernment. Provision is made for the election of five party judges\r\nof the Supreme Court, the proscription of four circuit judges, and the\r\nappointment of party clerks in more than half the counties of the\r\nState. Men professing respect for public opinion, and acknowledged to be\r\nleaders of the party, have avowed in the halls of legislation that\r\nthe change in the judiciary was intended to produce political results\r\nfavorable to their party and party friends. The immutable principles\r\nof justice are to make way for party interests, and the bonds of social\r\norder are to be rent in twain, in order that a desperate faction may\r\nbe sustained at the expense of the people. The change proposed in the\r\njudiciary was supported upon grounds so destructive to the institutions\r\nof the country, and so entirely at war with the rights and liberties\r\nof the people, that the party could not secure entire unanimity in its\r\nsupport, three Democrats of the Senate and five of the House voting\r\nagainst the measure. They were unwilling to see the temples of justice\r\nand the seats of independent judges occupied by the tools of faction.\r\nThe declarations of the party leaders, the selection of party men for\r\njudges, and the total disregard for the public will in the adoption of\r\nthe measure, prove conclusively that the object has been not reform, but\r\ndestruction; not the advancement of the highest interests of the State,\r\nbut the predominance of party.\r\n\r\nWe cannot in this manner undertake to point out all the objections to\r\nthis party measure; we present you with those stated by the Council\r\nof Revision upon returning the bill, and we ask for them a candid\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the independence of the judiciary has been destroyed,\r\nthat hereafter our courts will be independent of the people, and\r\nentirely dependent upon the Legislature; that our rights of property\r\nand liberty of conscience can no longer be regarded as safe from the\r\nencroachments of unconstitutional legislation; and knowing of no other\r\nremedy which can be adopted consistently with the peace and good order\r\nof society, we call upon you to avail yourselves of the opportunity\r\nafforded, and, at the next general election, vote for a convention of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n   S.

(2) It is a fatal blow at the independence\r\nof the judges and the constitutional term of their office. (3) It is a\r\nmeasure not asked for, or wished for, by the people. (4) It will greatly\r\nincrease the expense of our courts, or else greatly diminish their\r\nutility. (5) It will give our courts a political and partisan character,\r\nthereby impairing public confidence in their decisions. (6) It will\r\nimpair our standing with other States and the world. (7)It is a party\r\nmeasure for party purposes, from which no practical good to the people\r\ncan possibly arise, but which may be the source of immeasurable evils.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned are well aware that this protest will be altogether\r\nunavailing with the majority of this body. The blow has already fallen,\r\nand we are compelled to stand by, the mournful spectators of the ruin it\r\nwill cause.\r\n\r\n[Signed by 35 members, among whom was Abraham Lincoln.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED--MURDER CASE\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD June 19, 1841.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--We have had the highest state of excitement here for a week\r\npast that our community has ever witnessed; and, although the public\r\nfeeling is somewhat allayed, the curious affair which aroused it is very\r\nfar from being even yet cleared of mystery. It would take a quire of\r\npaper to give you anything like a full account of it, and I therefore\r\nonly propose a brief outline. The chief personages in the drama are\r\nArchibald Fisher, supposed to be murdered, and Archibald Trailor, Henry\r\nTrailor, and William Trailor, supposed to have murdered him. The three\r\nTrailors are brothers: the first, Arch., as you know, lives in town;\r\nthe second, Henry, in Clary's Grove; and the third, William, in Warren\r\nCounty; and Fisher, the supposed murdered, being without a family, had\r\nmade his home with William. On Saturday evening, being the 29th of May,\r\nFisher and William came to Henry's in a one-horse dearborn, and there\r\nstayed over Sunday; and on Monday all three came to Springfield (Henry\r\non horseback) and joined Archibald at Myers's, the Dutch carpenter.\r\nThat evening at supper Fisher was missing, and so next morning some\r\nineffectual search was made for him; and on Tuesday, at one o'clock\r\nP.M., William and Henry started home without him. In a day or two Henry\r\nand one or two of his Clary-Grove neighbors came back for him again, and\r\nadvertised his disappearance in the papers. The knowledge of the matter\r\nthus far had not been general, and here it dropped entirely, till about\r\nthe 10th instant, when Keys received a letter from the postmaster in\r\nWarren County, that William had arrived at home, and was telling a very\r\nmysterious and improbable story about the disappearance of Fisher, which\r\ninduced the community there to suppose he had been disposed of unfairly.\r\nKeys made this letter public, which immediately set the whole town and\r\nadjoining county agog. And so it has continued until yesterday. The mass\r\nof the people commenced a systematic search for the dead body, while\r\nWickersham was despatched to arrest Henry Trailor at the Grove, and Jim\r\nMaxcy to Warren to arrest William. On Monday last, Henry was brought in,\r\nand showed an evident inclination to insinuate that he knew Fisher to be\r\ndead, and that Arch. and William had killed him. He said he guessed the\r\nbody could be found in Spring Creek, between the Beardstown road and\r\nHickox's mill. Away the people swept like a herd of buffalo, and cut\r\ndown Hickox's mill-dam nolens volens, to draw the water out of the pond,\r\nand then went up and down and down and up the creek, fishing and raking,\r\nand raking and ducking and diving for two days, and, after all, no dead\r\nbody found.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a sort of scuffling-ground had been found in the brush\r\nin the angle, or point, where the road leading into the woods past\r\nthe brewery and the one leading in past the brick-yard meet. From the\r\nscuffle-ground was the sign of something about the size of a man having\r\nbeen dragged to the edge of the thicket, where it joined the track\r\nof some small-wheeled carriage drawn by one horse, as shown by the\r\nroad-tracks. The carriage-track led off toward Spring Creek. Near this\r\ndrag-trail Dr. Merryman found two hairs, which, after a long scientific\r\nexamination, he pronounced to be triangular human hairs, which term, he\r\nsays, includes within it the whiskers, the hair growing under the arms\r\nand on other parts of the body; and he judged that these two were of the\r\nwhiskers, because the ends were cut, showing that they had flourished in\r\nthe neighborhood of the razor's operations. On Thursday last Jim Maxcy\r\nbrought in William Trailor from Warren. On the same day Arch. was\r\narrested and put in jail. Yesterday (Friday) William was put upon his\r\nexamining trial before May and Lovely. Archibald and Henry were both\r\npresent. Lamborn prosecuted, and Logan, Baker, and your humble servant\r\ndefended. A great many witnesses were introduced and examined, but I\r\nshall only mention those whose testimony seemed most important. The\r\nfirst of these was Captain Ransdell. He swore that when William and\r\nHenry left Springfield for home on Tuesday before mentioned they did not\r\ntake the direct route,--which, you know, leads by the butcher shop,--but\r\nthat they followed the street north until they got opposite, or nearly\r\nopposite, May's new house, after which he could not see them from where\r\nhe stood; and it was afterwards proved that in about an hour after they\r\nstarted, they came into the street by the butcher shop from toward the\r\nbrickyard. Dr. Merryman and others swore to what is stated about the\r\nscuffle-ground, drag-trail, whiskers, and carriage tracks. Henry was\r\nthen introduced by the prosecution. He swore that when they started for\r\nhome they went out north, as Ransdell stated, and turned down west\r\nby the brick-yard into the woods, and there met Archibald; that they\r\nproceeded a small distance farther, when he was placed as a sentinel to\r\nwatch for and announce the approach of any one that might happen that\r\nway; that William and Arch. took the dearborn out of the road a small\r\ndistance to the edge of the thicket, where they stopped, and he saw\r\nthem lift the body of a man into it; that they then moved off with the\r\ncarriage in the direction of Hickox's mill, and he loitered about for\r\nsomething like an hour, when William returned with the carriage, but\r\nwithout Arch., and said they had put him in a safe place; that they went\r\nsomehow he did not know exactly how--into the road close to the brewery,\r\nand proceeded on to Clary's Grove. He also stated that some time during\r\nthe day William told him that he and Arch. had killed Fisher the evening\r\nbefore; that the way they did it was by him William knocking him down\r\nwith a club, and Arch. then choking him to death.\r\n\r\nAn old man from Warren, called Dr. Gilmore, was then introduced on\r\nthe part of the defense. He swore that he had known Fisher for several\r\nyears; that Fisher had resided at his house a long time at each of two\r\ndifferent spells--once while he built a barn for him, and once while\r\nhe was doctored for some chronic disease; that two or three years ago\r\nFisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun, since\r\nwhich he had been subject to continued bad health and occasional\r\naberration of mind. He also stated that on last Tuesday, being the same\r\nday that Maxcy arrested William Trailor, he (the doctor) was from home\r\nin the early part of the day, and on his return, about eleven o'clock,\r\nfound Fisher at his house in bed, and apparently very unwell; that he\r\nasked him how he came from Springfield; that Fisher said he had come by\r\nPeoria, and also told of several other places he had been at more in the\r\ndirection of Peoria, which showed that he at the time of speaking did\r\nnot know where he had been wandering about in a state of derangement.\r\nHe further stated that in about two hours he received a note from one of\r\nTrailor's friends, advising him of his arrest, and requesting him to go\r\non to Springfield as a witness, to testify as to the state of Fisher's\r\nhealth in former times; that he immediately set off, calling up two\r\nof his neighbors as company, and, riding all evening and all night,\r\novertook Maxcy and William at Lewiston in Fulton County; that Maxcy\r\nrefusing to discharge Trailor upon his statement, his two neighbors\r\nreturned and he came on to Springfield. Some question being made as to\r\nwhether the doctor's story was not a fabrication, several acquaintances\r\nof his (among whom was the same postmaster who wrote Keys, as before\r\nmentioned) were introduced as sort of compurgators, who swore that they\r\nknew the doctor to be of good character for truth and veracity, and\r\ngenerally of good character in every way.\r\n\r\nHere the testimony ended, and the Trailors were discharged, Arch. and\r\nWilliam expressing both in word and manner their entire confidence that\r\nFisher would be found alive at the doctor's by Galloway, Mallory, and\r\nMyers, who a day before had been despatched for that purpose; which\r\nHenry still protested that no power on earth could ever show Fisher\r\nalive. Thus stands this curious affair. When the doctor's story\r\nwas first made public, it was amusing to scan and contemplate the\r\ncountenances and hear the remarks of those who had been actively in\r\nsearch for the dead body: some looked quizzical, some melancholy, and\r\nsome furiously angry. Porter, who had been very active, swore he always\r\nknew the man was not dead, and that he had not stirred an inch to hunt\r\nfor him; Langford, who had taken the lead in cutting down Hickox's\r\nmill-dam, and wanted to hang Hickox for objecting, looked most\r\nawfully woebegone: he seemed the \"victim of unrequited affection,\" as\r\nrepresented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over; and Hart, the\r\nlittle drayman that hauled Molly home once, said it was too damned bad\r\nto have so much trouble, and no hanging after all.\r\n\r\nI commenced this letter on yesterday, since which I received yours of\r\nthe 13th. I stick to my promise to come to Louisville. Nothing new here\r\nexcept what I have written. I have not seen ______ since my last trip,\r\nand I am going out there as soon as I mail this letter.\r\n\r\nYours forever, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT ABOUT HARRY WILTON.\r\n\r\nJune 25, 1841\r\n\r\nIt having been charged in some of the public prints that Harry Wilton,\r\nlate United States marshal for the district of Illinois, had used his\r\noffice for political effect, in the appointment of deputies for the\r\ntaking of the census for the year 1840, we, the undersigned, were called\r\nupon by Mr. Wilton to examine the papers in his possession relative\r\nto these appointments, and to ascertain therefrom the correctness or\r\nincorrectness of such charge. We accompanied Mr. Wilton to a room, and\r\nexamined the matter as fully as we could with the means afforded us. The\r\nonly sources of information bearing on the subject which were submitted\r\nto us were the letters, etc., recommending and opposing the various\r\nappointments made, and Mr. Wilton's verbal statements concerning the\r\nsame. From these letters, etc., it appears that in some instances\r\nappointments were made in accordance with the recommendations of leading\r\nWhigs, and in opposition to those of leading Democrats; among which\r\ninstances the appointments at Scott, Wayne, Madison, and Lawrence are\r\nthe strongest. According to Mr. Wilton's statement of the seventy-six\r\nappointments we examined, fifty-four were of Democrats, eleven of Whigs,\r\nand eleven of unknown politics.\r\n\r\nThe chief ground of complaint against Mr. Wilton, as we had understood\r\nit, was because of his appointment of so many Democratic candidates for\r\nthe Legislature, thus giving them a decided advantage over their\r\nWhig opponents; and consequently our attention was directed rather\r\nparticularly to that point. We found that there were many such\r\nappointments, among which were those in Tazewell, McLean, Iroquois,\r\nColes, Menard, Wayne, Washington, Fayette, etc.; and we did not\r\nlearn that there was one instance in which a Whig candidate for the\r\nLegislature had been appointed. There was no written evidence before\r\nus showing us at what time those appointments were made; but Mr. Wilton\r\nstated that they all with one exception were made before those\r\nappointed became candidates for the Legislature, and the letters, etc.,\r\nrecommending them all bear date before, and most of them long before,\r\nthose appointed were publicly announced candidates.\r\n\r\nWe give the foregoing naked facts and draw no conclusions from them.\r\n\r\nBEND. S. EDWARDS, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MISS MARY SPEED--PRACTICAL SLAVERY\r\n\r\nBLOOMINGTON, ILL., September 27, 1841.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Speed, Louisville, Ky.\r\n\r\nMY FRIEND: By the way, a fine example was presented on board the boat\r\nfor contemplating the effect of condition upon human happiness. A\r\ngentleman had purchased twelve negroes in different parts of Kentucky,\r\nand was taking them to a farm in the South. They were chained six and\r\nsix together. A small iron clevis was around the left wrist of each,\r\nand this fastened to the main chain by a shorter one, at a convenient\r\ndistance from the others, so that the negroes were strung together\r\nprecisely like so many fish upon a trotline. In this condition they\r\nwere being separated forever from the scenes of their childhood, their\r\nfriends, their fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters, and many\r\nof them from their wives and children, and going into perpetual\r\nslavery where the lash of the master is proverbially more ruthless\r\nand unrelenting than any other; and yet amid all these distressing\r\ncircumstances, as we would think them, they were the most cheerful and\r\napparently happy creatures on board. One, whose offence for which he\r\nhad been sold was an overfondness for his wife, played the fiddle almost\r\ncontinually, and the others danced, sang, cracked jokes, and played\r\nvarious games with cards from day to day. How true it is that 'God\r\ntempers the wind to the shorn lamb,' or in other words, that he renders\r\nthe worst of human conditions tolerable, while he permits the best to\r\nbe nothing better than tolerable. To return to the narrative: When we\r\nreached Springfield I stayed but one day, when I started on this tedious\r\ncircuit where I now am. Do you remember my going to the city, while I\r\nwas in Kentucky, to have a tooth extracted, and making a failure of it?\r\nWell, that same old tooth got to paining me so much that about a week\r\nsince I had it torn out, bringing with it a bit of the jawbone, the\r\nconsequence of which is that my mouth is now so sore that I can neither\r\ntalk nor eat.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1842\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED--ON MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nJanuary 30, 1842.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SPEED:--Feeling, as you know I do, the deepest solicitude for\r\nthe success of the enterprise you are engaged in, I adopt this as the\r\nlast method I can adopt to aid you, in case (which God forbid!) you\r\nshall need any aid. I do not place what I am going to say on paper\r\nbecause I can say it better that way than I could by word of mouth, but,\r\nwere I to say it orally before we part, most likely you would forget\r\nit at the very time when it might do you some good. As I think it\r\nreasonable that you will feel very badly some time between this and the\r\nfinal consummation of your purpose, it is intended that you shall read\r\nthis just at such a time. Why I say it is reasonable that you will feel\r\nvery badly yet, is because of three special causes added to the general\r\none which I shall mention.\r\n\r\nThe general cause is, that you are naturally of a nervous temperament;\r\nand this I say from what I have seen of you personally, and what you\r\nhave told me concerning your mother at various times, and concerning\r\nyour brother William at the time his wife died. The first special cause\r\nis your exposure to bad weather on your journey, which my experience\r\nclearly proves to be very severe on defective nerves. The second is the\r\nabsence of all business and conversation of friends, which might divert\r\nyour mind, give it occasional rest from the intensity of thought which\r\nwill sometimes wear the sweetest idea threadbare and turn it to the\r\nbitterness of death. The third is the rapid and near approach of that\r\ncrisis on which all your thoughts and feelings concentrate.\r\n\r\nIf from all these causes you shall escape and go through triumphantly,\r\nwithout another \"twinge of the soul,\" I shall be most happily but most\r\negregiously deceived. If, on the contrary, you shall, as I expect you\r\nwill at sometime, be agonized and distressed, let me, who have some\r\nreason to speak with judgment on such a subject, beseech you to ascribe\r\nit to the causes I have mentioned, and not to some false and ruinous\r\nsuggestion of the Devil.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" you will say, \"do not your causes apply to every one engaged in\r\na like undertaking?\" By no means. The particular causes, to a greater\r\nor less extent, perhaps do apply in all cases; but the general\r\none,--nervous debility, which is the key and conductor of all\r\nthe particular ones, and without which they would be utterly\r\nharmless,--though it does pertain to you, does not pertain to one in a\r\nthousand. It is out of this that the painful difference between you and\r\nthe mass of the world springs.\r\n\r\nI know what the painful point with you is at all times when you are\r\nunhappy; it is an apprehension that you do not love her as you should.\r\nWhat nonsense! How came you to court her? Was it because you thought she\r\ndeserved it, and that you had given her reason to expect it? If it was\r\nfor that why did not the same reason make you court Ann Todd, and at\r\nleast twenty others of whom you can think, and to whom it would apply\r\nwith greater force than to her? Did you court her for her wealth? Why,\r\nyou know she had none. But you say you reasoned yourself into it. What\r\ndo you mean by that? Was it not that you found yourself unable to reason\r\nyourself out of it? Did you not think, and partly form the purpose, of\r\ncourting her the first time you ever saw her or heard of her? What had\r\nreason to do with it at that early stage? There was nothing at that time\r\nfor reason to work upon. Whether she was moral, amiable, sensible,\r\nor even of good character, you did not, nor could then know, except,\r\nperhaps, you might infer the last from the company you found her in.\r\n\r\nAll you then did or could know of her was her personal appearance and\r\ndeportment; and these, if they impress at all, impress the heart, and\r\nnot the head.\r\n\r\nSay candidly, were not those heavenly black eyes the whole basis of all\r\nyour early reasoning on the subject? After you and I had once been at\r\nthe residence, did you not go and take me all the way to Lexington and\r\nback, for no other purpose but to get to see her again, on our return\r\non that evening to take a trip for that express object? What earthly\r\nconsideration would you take to find her scouting and despising you, and\r\ngiving herself up to another? But of this you have no apprehension; and\r\ntherefore you cannot bring it home to your feelings.\r\n\r\nI shall be so anxious about you that I shall want you to write by every\r\nmail.\r\n\r\nYour friend, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, February 3, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--Your letter of the 25th January came to hand to-day. You\r\nwell know that I do not feel my own sorrows much more keenly than I do\r\nyours, when I know of them; and yet I assure you I was not much hurt by\r\nwhat you wrote me of your excessively bad feeling at the time you wrote.\r\nNot that I am less capable of sympathizing with you now than ever, not\r\nthat I am less your friend than ever, but because I hope and believe\r\nthat your present anxiety and distress about her health and her life\r\nmust and will forever banish those horrid doubts which I know you\r\nsometimes felt as to the truth of your affection for her. If they can\r\nonce and forever be removed (and I almost feel a presentiment that the\r\nAlmighty has sent your present affliction expressly for that object),\r\nsurely nothing can come in their stead to fill their immeasurable\r\nmeasure of misery. The death-scenes of those we love are surely painful\r\nenough; but these we are prepared for and expect to see: they happen to\r\nall, and all know they must happen. Painful as they are, they are not\r\nan unlooked for sorrow. Should she, as you fear, be destined to an early\r\ngrave, it is indeed a great consolation to know that she is so well\r\nprepared to meet it. Her religion, which you once disliked so much,\r\nI will venture you now prize most highly. But I hope your melancholy\r\nbodings as to her early death are not well founded. I even hope that\r\nere this reaches you she will have returned with improved and still\r\nimproving health, and that you will have met her, and forgotten the\r\nsorrows of the past in the enjoyments of the present. I would say more\r\nif I could, but it seems that I have said enough. It really appears\r\nto me that you yourself ought to rejoice, and not sorrow, at this\r\nindubitable evidence of your undying affection for her. Why, Speed, if\r\nyou did not love her although you might not wish her death, you would\r\nmost certainly be resigned to it. Perhaps this point is no longer\r\na question with you, and my pertinacious dwelling upon it is a rude\r\nintrusion upon your feelings. If so, you must pardon me. You know the\r\nhell I have suffered on that point, and how tender I am upon it. You\r\nknow I do not mean wrong. I have been quite clear of \"hypo\" since you\r\nleft, even better than I was along in the fall. I have seen ______ but\r\nonce. She seemed very cheerful, and so I said nothing to her about what\r\nwe spoke of.\r\n\r\nOld Uncle Billy Herndon is dead, and it is said this evening that Uncle\r\nBen Ferguson will not live. This, I believe, is all the news, and enough\r\nat that unless it were better. Write me immediately on the receipt of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED--ON DEPRESSION\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, February 13, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 1st instant came to hand three or four days\r\nago. When this shall reach you, you will have been Fanny's husband\r\nseveral days. You know my desire to befriend you is everlasting; that\r\nI will never cease while I know how to do anything. But you will always\r\nhereafter be on ground that I have never occupied, and consequently,\r\nif advice were needed, I might advise wrong. I do fondly hope, however,\r\nthat you will never again need any comfort from abroad. But should I be\r\nmistaken in this, should excessive pleasure still be accompanied with\r\na painful counterpart at times, still let me urge you, as I have ever\r\ndone, to remember, in the depth and even agony of despondency, that very\r\nshortly you are to feel well again. I am now fully convinced that you\r\nlove her as ardently as you are capable of loving. Your ever being happy\r\nin her presence, and your intense anxiety about her health, if there\r\nwere nothing else, would place this beyond all dispute in my mind. I\r\nincline to think it probable that your nerves will fail you occasionally\r\nfor a while; but once you get them firmly guarded now that trouble is\r\nover forever. I think, if I were you, in case my mind were not exactly\r\nright, I would avoid being idle. I would immediately engage in some\r\nbusiness, or go to making preparations for it, which would be the same\r\nthing. If you went through the ceremony calmly, or even with sufficient\r\ncomposure not to excite alarm in any present, you are safe beyond\r\nquestion, and in two or three months, to say the most, will be the\r\nhappiest of men.\r\n\r\nI would desire you to give my particular respects to Fanny; but perhaps\r\nyou will not wish her to know you have received this, lest she should\r\ndesire to see it. Make her write me an answer to my last letter to her;\r\nat any rate I would set great value upon a note or letter from her.\r\nWrite me whenever you have leisure. Yours forever, A. LINCOLN. P. S.--I\r\nhave been quite a man since you left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. B. SHELEDY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Feb. 16, 1842.\r\n\r\nG. B. SHELEDY, ESQ.:\r\n\r\nYours of the 10th is duly received. Judge Logan and myself are doing\r\nbusiness together now, and we are willing to attend to your cases as you\r\npropose. As to the terms, we are willing to attend each case you prepare\r\nand send us for $10 (when there shall be no opposition) to be sent in\r\nadvance, or you to know that it is safe. It takes $5.75 of cost to\r\nstart upon, that is, $1.75 to clerk, and $2 to each of two publishers\r\nof papers. Judge Logan thinks it will take the balance of $20 to carry\r\na case through. This must be advanced from time to time as the services\r\nare performed, as the officers will not act without. I do not know\r\nwhether you can be admitted an attorney of the Federal court in your\r\nabsence or not; nor is it material, as the business can be done in our\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThinking it may aid you a little, I send you one of our blank forms of\r\nPetitions. It, you will see, is framed to be sworn to before the Federal\r\ncourt clerk, and, in your cases, will have [to] be so far changed as to\r\nbe sworn to before the clerk of your circuit court; and his certificate\r\nmust be accompanied with his official seal. The schedules, too, must\r\nbe attended to. Be sure that they contain the creditors' names, their\r\nresidences, the amounts due each, the debtors' names, their residences,\r\nand the amounts they owe, also all property and where located.\r\n\r\nAlso be sure that the schedules are all signed by the applicants as well\r\nas the Petition. Publication will have to be made here in one paper,\r\nand in one nearest the residence of the applicant. Write us in each case\r\nwhere the last advertisement is to be sent, whether to you or to what\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nI believe I have now said everything that can be of any advantage. Your\r\nfriend as ever, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE E. PICKETT--ADVICE TO YOUTH\r\n\r\nFebruary 22, 1842.\r\n\r\nI never encourage deceit, and falsehood, especially if you have got a\r\nbad memory, is the worst enemy a fellow can have. The fact is truth\r\nis your truest friend, no matter what the circumstances are.\r\nNotwithstanding this copy-book preamble, my boy, I am inclined to\r\nsuggest a little prudence on your part. You see I have a congenital\r\naversion to failure, and the sudden announcement to your Uncle Andrew of\r\nthe success of your \"lamp rubbing\" might possibly prevent your passing\r\nthe severe physical examination to which you will be subjected in order\r\nto enter the Military Academy. You see I should like to have a perfect\r\nsoldier credited to dear old Illinois--no broken bones, scalp wounds,\r\netc. So I think it might be wise to hand this letter from me in to\r\nyour good uncle through his room-window after he has had a comfortable\r\ndinner, and watch its effect from the top of the pigeon-house.\r\n\r\nI have just told the folks here in Springfield on this 111th anniversary\r\nof the birth of him whose name, mightiest in the cause of civil liberty,\r\nstill mightiest in the cause of moral reformation, we mention in solemn\r\nawe, in naked, deathless splendor, that the one victory we can ever call\r\ncomplete will be that one which proclaims that there is not one slave or\r\none drunkard on the face of God's green earth. Recruit for this victory.\r\n\r\nNow, boy, on your march, don't you go and forget the old maxim that \"one\r\ndrop of honey catches more flies than a half-gallon of gall.\" Load your\r\nmusket with this maxim, and smoke it in your pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS BEFORE THE SPRINGFIELD WASHINGTONIAN TEMPERANCE SOCIETY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1842.\r\n\r\nAlthough the temperance cause has been in progress for near twenty\r\nyears, it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a\r\ndegree of success hitherto unparalleled.\r\n\r\nThe list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties, of\r\nhundreds, and of thousands. The cause itself seems suddenly transformed\r\nfrom a cold abstract theory to a living, breathing, active, and powerful\r\nchieftain, going forth \"conquering and to conquer.\" The citadels of his\r\ngreat adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his temple and\r\nhis altars, where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been\r\nperformed, and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made,\r\nare daily desecrated and deserted. The triumph of the conqueror's fame\r\nis sounding from hill to hill, from sea to sea, and from land to land,\r\nand calling millions to his standard at a blast.\r\n\r\nFor this new and splendid success we heartily rejoice. That that success\r\nis so much greater now than heretofore is doubtless owing to rational\r\ncauses; and if we would have it continue, we shall do well to inquire\r\nwhat those causes are.\r\n\r\nThe warfare heretofore waged against the demon intemperance has somehow\r\nor other been erroneous. Either the champions engaged or the tactics\r\nthey adopted have not been the most proper. These champions for the most\r\npart have been preachers, lawyers, and hired agents. Between these and\r\nthe mass of mankind there is a want of approachability, if the term\r\nbe admissible, partially, at least, fatal to their success. They are\r\nsupposed to have no sympathy of feeling or interest with those very\r\npersons whom it is their object to convince and persuade.\r\n\r\nAnd again, it is so common and so easy to ascribe motives to men of\r\nthese classes other than those they profess to act upon. The preacher,\r\nit is said, advocates temperance because he is a fanatic, and desires a\r\nunion of the Church and State; the lawyer from his pride and vanity of\r\nhearing himself speak; and the hired agent for his salary. But when one\r\nwho has long been known as a victim of intemperance bursts the fetters\r\nthat have bound him, and appears before his neighbors \"clothed and in\r\nhis right mind,\" a redeemed specimen of long-lost humanity, and stands\r\nup, with tears of joy trembling in his eyes, to tell of the miseries\r\nonce endured, now to be endured no more forever; of his once naked and\r\nstarving children, now clad and fed comfortably; of a wife long weighed\r\ndown with woe, weeping, and a broken heart, now restored to health,\r\nhappiness, and a renewed affection; and how easily it is all done, once\r\nit is resolved to be done; how simple his language! there is a logic and\r\nan eloquence in it that few with human feelings can resist. They cannot\r\nsay that he desires a union of Church and State, for he is not a church\r\nmember; they cannot say he is vain of hearing himself speak, for his\r\nwhole demeanor shows he would gladly avoid speaking at all; they cannot\r\nsay he speaks for pay, for he receives none, and asks for none. Nor can\r\nhis sincerity in any way be doubted, or his sympathy for those he would\r\npersuade to imitate his example be denied.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, it is to the battles of this new class of champions\r\nthat our late success is greatly, perhaps chiefly, owing. But, had the\r\nold-school champions themselves been of the most wise selecting, was\r\ntheir system of tactics the most judicious? It seems to me it was\r\nnot. Too much denunciation against dram-sellers and dram-drinkers\r\nwas indulged in. This I think was both impolitic and unjust. It was\r\nimpolitic, because it is not much in the nature of man to be driven to\r\nanything; still less to be driven about that which is exclusively his\r\nown business; and least of all where such driving is to be submitted\r\nto at the expense of pecuniary interest or burning appetite. When the\r\ndram-seller and drinker were incessantly told not in accents of entreaty\r\nand persuasion, diffidently addressed by erring man to an erring\r\nbrother, but in the thundering tones of anathema and denunciation with\r\nwhich the lordly judge often groups together all the crimes of the\r\nfelon's life, and thrusts them in his face just ere he passes sentence\r\nof death upon him that they were the authors of all the vice and misery\r\nand crime in the land; that they were the manufacturers and material of\r\nall the thieves and robbers and murderers that infest the earth; that\r\ntheir houses were the workshops of the devil; and that their persons\r\nshould be shunned by all the good and virtuous, as moral pestilences--I\r\nsay, when they were told all this, and in this way, it is not wonderful\r\nthat they were slow to acknowledge the truth of such denunciations,\r\nand to join the ranks of their denouncers in a hue and cry against\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nTo have expected them to do otherwise than they did to have expected\r\nthem not to meet denunciation with denunciation, crimination with\r\ncrimination, and anathema with anathema--was to expect a reversal of\r\nhuman nature, which is God's decree and can never be reversed.\r\n\r\nWhen the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind,\r\nunassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted. It is an old and a true\r\nmaxim that \"a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.\"\r\nSo with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him\r\nthat you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches\r\nhis heart, which, say what he will, is the great highroad to his\r\nreason; and which, when once gained, you will find but little trouble\r\nin convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause, if indeed that\r\ncause really be a just one. On the contrary, assume to dictate to his\r\njudgment, or to command his action, or to mark him as one to be shunned\r\nand despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues\r\nto his head and his heart; and though your cause be naked truth itself,\r\ntransformed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel, and sharper than\r\nsteel can be made, and though you throw it with more than herculean\r\nforce and precision, you shall be no more able to pierce him than to\r\npenetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw. Such is man,\r\nand so must he be understood by those who would lead him, even to his\r\nown best interests.\r\n\r\nOn this point the Washingtonians greatly excel the temperance advocates\r\nof former times. Those whom they desire to convince and persuade are\r\ntheir old friends and companions. They know they are not demons, nor\r\neven the worst of men; they know that generally they are kind, generous,\r\nand charitable even beyond the example of their more staid and sober\r\nneighbors. They are practical philanthropists; and they glow with\r\na generous and brotherly zeal that mere theorizers are incapable of\r\nfeeling. Benevolence and charity possess their hearts entirely; and out\r\nof the abundance of their hearts their tongues give utterance; \"love\r\nthrough all their actions runs, and all their words are mild.\" In this\r\nspirit they speak and act, and in the same they are heard and regarded.\r\nAnd when such is the temper of the advocate, and such of the audience,\r\nno good cause can be unsuccessful. But I have said that denunciations\r\nagainst dramsellers and dram-drinkers are unjust, as well as impolitic.\r\nLet us see. I have not inquired at what period of time the use of\r\nintoxicating liquors commenced; nor is it important to know. It is\r\nsufficient that, to all of us who now inhabit the world, the practice of\r\ndrinking them is just as old as the world itself that is, we have seen\r\nthe one just as long as we have seen the other. When all such of us as\r\nhave now reached the years of maturity first opened our eyes upon\r\nthe stage of existence, we found intoxicating liquor recognized by\r\neverybody, used by everybody, repudiated by nobody. It commonly entered\r\ninto the first draught of the infant and the last draught of the dying\r\nman. From the sideboard of the parson down to the ragged pocket of the\r\nhouseless loafer, it was constantly found. Physicians proscribed it in\r\nthis, that, and the other disease; government provided it for soldiers\r\nand sailors; and to have a rolling or raising, a husking or \"hoedown,\"\r\nanywhere about without it was positively insufferable. So, too, it was\r\neverywhere a respectable article of manufacture and merchandise. The\r\nmaking of it was regarded as an honorable livelihood, and he who could\r\nmake most was the most enterprising and respectable. Large and small\r\nmanufactories of it were everywhere erected, in which all the earthly\r\ngoods of their owners were invested. Wagons drew it from town to town;\r\nboats bore it from clime to clime, and the winds wafted it from nation\r\nto nation; and merchants bought and sold it, by wholesale and retail,\r\nwith precisely the same feelings on the part of the seller, buyer, and\r\nbystander as are felt at the selling and buying of ploughs, beef, bacon,\r\nor any other of the real necessaries of life. Universal public opinion\r\nnot only tolerated but recognized and adopted its use.\r\n\r\nIt is true that even then it was known and acknowledged that many were\r\ngreatly injured by it; but none seemed to think the injury arose from\r\nthe use of a bad thing, but from the abuse of a very good thing. The\r\nvictims of it were to be pitied and compassionated, just as are the\r\nheirs of consumption and other hereditary diseases. Their failing was\r\ntreated as a misfortune, and not as a crime, or even as a disgrace. If,\r\nthen, what I have been saying is true, is it wonderful that some should\r\nthink and act now as all thought and acted twenty years ago? and is it\r\njust to assail, condemn, or despise them for doing so? The universal\r\nsense of mankind on any subject is an argument, or at least an\r\ninfluence, not easily overcome. The success of the argument in favor\r\nof the existence of an overruling Providence mainly depends upon that\r\nsense; and men ought not in justice to be denounced for yielding to it\r\nin any case, or giving it up slowly, especially when they are backed by\r\ninterest, fixed habits, or burning appetites.\r\n\r\nAnother error, as it seems to me, into which the old reformers fell, was\r\nthe position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible, and\r\ntherefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that\r\nthe grace of temperance might abound, to the temperate then, and to all\r\nmankind some hundreds of years thereafter. There is in this some\r\nthing so repugnant to humanity, so uncharitable, so cold-blooded and\r\nfeelingless, that it, never did nor ever can enlist the enthusiasm of a\r\npopular cause. We could not love the man who taught it we could not hear\r\nhim with patience. The heart could not throw open its portals to it,\r\nthe generous man could not adopt it--it could not mix with his blood.\r\nIt looked so fiendishly selfish, so like throwing fathers and brothers\r\noverboard to lighten the boat for our security, that the noble-minded\r\nshrank from the manifest meanness of the thing. And besides this, the\r\nbenefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system were too\r\nremote in point of time to warmly engage many in its behalf. Few can\r\nbe induced to labor exclusively for posterity, and none will do it\r\nenthusiastically. --Posterity has done nothing for us; and, theorize on\r\nit as we may, practically we shall do very little for it, unless we are\r\nmade to think we are at the same time doing something for ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhat an ignorance of human nature does it exhibit to ask or to expect\r\na whole community to rise up and labor for the temporal happiness of\r\nothers, after themselves shall be consigned to the dust, a majority\r\nof which community take no pains whatever to secure their own eternal\r\nwelfare at no more distant day! Great distance in either time or\r\nspace has wonderful power to lull and render quiescent the human mind.\r\nPleasures to be enjoyed, or pains to be endured, after we shall be dead\r\nand gone are but little regarded even in our own cases, and much less\r\nin the cases of others. Still, in addition to this there is something so\r\nludicrous in promises of good or threats of evil a great way off as to\r\nrender the whole subject with which they are connected easily turned\r\ninto ridicule. \"Better lay down that spade you are stealing, Paddy; if\r\nyou don't you'll pay for it at the day of judgment.\" \"Be the powers, if\r\nye'll credit me so long I'll take another jist.\"\r\n\r\nBy the Washingtonians this system of consigning the habitual drunkard\r\nto hopeless ruin is repudiated. They adopt a more enlarged philanthropy;\r\nthey go for present as well as future good. They labor for all now\r\nliving, as well as hereafter to live. They teach hope to all-despair to\r\nnone. As applying to their cause, they deny the doctrine of\r\nunpardonable sin; as in Christianity it is taught, so in this they\r\nteach--\"While--While the lamp holds out to burn, The vilest sinner may\r\nreturn.\" And, what is a matter of more profound congratulation, they, by\r\nexperiment upon experiment and example upon example, prove the maxim\r\nto be no less true in the one case than in the other. On every hand we\r\nbehold those who but yesterday were the chief of sinners, now the chief\r\napostles of the cause. Drunken devils are cast out by ones, by sevens,\r\nby legions; and their unfortunate victims, like the poor possessed who\r\nwere redeemed from their long and lonely wanderings in the tombs, are\r\npublishing to the ends of the earth how great things have been done for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo these new champions and this new system of tactics our late\r\nsuccess is mainly owing, and to them we must mainly look for the final\r\nconsummation. The ball is now rolling gloriously on, and none are so\r\nable as they to increase its speed and its bulk, to add to its momentum\r\nand its magnitude--even though unlearned in letters, for this task none\r\nare so well educated. To fit them for this work they have been taught in\r\nthe true school. They have been in that gulf from which they would teach\r\nothers the means of escape. They have passed that prison wall which\r\nothers have long declared impassable; and who that has not shall dare to\r\nweigh opinions with them as to the mode of passing?\r\n\r\nBut if it be true, as I have insisted, that those who have suffered by\r\nintemperance personally, and have reformed, are the most powerful and\r\nefficient instruments to push the reformation to ultimate success, it\r\ndoes not follow that those who have not suffered have no part left them\r\nto perform. Whether or not the world would be vastly benefited by a\r\ntotal and final banishment from it of all intoxicating drinks seems\r\nto me not now an open question. Three fourths of mankind confess the\r\naffirmative with their tongues, and, I believe, all the rest acknowledge\r\nit in their hearts.\r\n\r\nOught any, then, to refuse their aid in doing what good the good of the\r\nwhole demands? Shall he who cannot do much be for that reason excused\r\nif he do nothing? \"But,\" says one, \"what good can I do by signing the\r\npledge? I never drank, even without signing.\" This question has already\r\nbeen asked and answered more than a million of times. Let it be answered\r\nonce more. For the man suddenly or in any other way to break off from\r\nthe use of drams, who has indulged in them for a long course of years\r\nand until his appetite for them has grown ten or a hundredfold stronger\r\nand more craving than any natural appetite can be, requires a most\r\npowerful moral effort. In such an undertaking he needs every moral\r\nsupport and influence that can possibly be brought to his aid and thrown\r\naround him. And not only so, but every moral prop should be taken from\r\nwhatever argument might rise in his mind to lure him to his backsliding.\r\nWhen he casts his eyes around him, he should be able to see all that he\r\nrespects, all that he admires, all that he loves, kindly and anxiously\r\npointing him onward, and none beckoning him back to his former miserable\r\n\"wallowing in the mire.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is said by some that men will think and act for themselves; that\r\nnone will disuse spirits or anything else because his neighbors do; and\r\nthat moral influence is not that powerful engine contended for. Let us\r\nexamine this. Let me ask the man who could maintain this position most\r\nstiffly, what compensation he will accept to go to church some Sunday\r\nand sit during the sermon with his wife's bonnet upon his head? Not a\r\ntrifle, I'll venture. And why not? There would be nothing irreligious\r\nin it, nothing immoral, nothing uncomfortable--then why not? Is it not\r\nbecause there would be something egregiously unfashionable in it? Then\r\nit is the influence of fashion; and what is the influence of fashion\r\nbut the influence that other people's actions have on our actions--the\r\nstrong inclination each of us feels to do as we see all our neighbors\r\ndo? Nor is the influence of fashion confined to any particular thing or\r\nclass of things; it is just as strong on one subject as another. Let us\r\nmake it as unfashionable to withhold our names from the temperance cause\r\nas for husbands to wear their wives' bonnets to church, and instances\r\nwill be just as rare in the one case as the other.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" say some, \"we are no drunkards, and we shall not acknowledge\r\nourselves such by joining a reformed drunkard's society, whatever our\r\ninfluence might be.\" Surely no Christian will adhere to this objection.\r\nIf they believe as they profess, that Omnipotence condescended to take\r\non himself the form of sinful man, and as such to die an ignominious\r\ndeath for their sakes, surely they will not refuse submission to the\r\ninfinitely lesser condescension, for the temporal, and perhaps\r\neternal, salvation of a large, erring, and unfortunate class of their\r\nfellow-creatures. Nor is the condescension very great. In my judgment\r\nsuch of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more by the\r\nabsence of appetite than from any mental or moral superiority over those\r\nwho have. Indeed, I believe if we take habitual drunkards as a class,\r\ntheir heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with\r\nthose of any other class. There seems ever to have been a proneness\r\nin the brilliant and warm-blooded to fall into this vice--the demon of\r\nintemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius\r\nand of generosity. What one of us but can call to mind some relative,\r\nmore promising in youth than all his fellows, who has fallen a sacrifice\r\nto his rapacity? He ever seems to have gone forth like the Egyptian\r\nangel of death, commissioned to slay, if not the first, the fairest born\r\nof every family. Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career? In\r\nthat arrest all can give aid that will; and who shall be excused that\r\ncan and will not? Far around as human breath has ever blown he keeps our\r\nfathers, our brothers, our sons, and our friends prostrate in the chains\r\nof moral death. To all the living everywhere we cry, \"Come sound the\r\nmoral trump, that these may rise and stand up an exceeding great army.\"\r\n\"Come from the four winds, O breath! and breathe upon these slain\r\nthat they may live.\" If the relative grandeur of revolutions shall be\r\nestimated by the great amount of human misery they alleviate, and the\r\nsmall amount they inflict, then indeed will this be the grandest the\r\nworld shall ever have seen.\r\n\r\nOf our political revolution of '76 we are all justly proud. It has given\r\nus a degree of political freedom far exceeding that of any other nation\r\nof the earth. In it the world has found a solution of the long-mooted\r\nproblem as to the capability of man to govern himself. In it was the\r\ngerm which has vegetated, and still is to grow and expand into the\r\nuniversal liberty of mankind. But, with all these glorious results,\r\npast, present, and to come, it had its evils too. It breathed forth\r\nfamine, swam in blood, and rode in fire; and long, long after, the\r\norphan's cry and the widow's wail continued to break the sad silence\r\nthat ensued. These were the price, the inevitable price, paid for the\r\nblessings it bought.\r\n\r\nTurn now to the temperance revolution. In it we shall find a stronger\r\nbondage broken, a viler slavery manumitted, a greater tyrant deposed; in\r\nit, more of want supplied, more disease healed, more sorrow assuaged.\r\nBy it no Orphans starving, no widows weeping. By it none wounded in\r\nfeeling, none injured in interest; even the drammaker and dram-seller\r\nwill have glided into other occupations so gradually as never to\r\nhave felt the change, and will stand ready to join all others in the\r\nuniversal song of gladness. And what a noble ally this to the cause of\r\npolitical freedom, with such an aid its march cannot fail to be on\r\nand on, till every son of earth shall drink in rich fruition the\r\nsorrow-quenching draughts of perfect liberty. Happy day when-all\r\nappetites controlled, all poisons subdued, all matter subjected-mind,\r\nall-conquering mind, shall live and move, the monarch of the world.\r\nGlorious consummation! Hail, fall of fury! Reign of reason, all hail!\r\n\r\nAnd when the victory shall be complete, when there shall be neither\r\na slave nor a drunkard on the earth, how proud the title of that land\r\nwhich may truly claim to be the birthplace and the cradle of both\r\nthose revolutions that shall have ended in that victory. How nobly\r\ndistinguished that people who shall have planted and nurtured to\r\nmaturity both the political and moral freedom of their species.\r\n\r\nThis is the one hundred and tenth anniversary of the birthday of\r\nWashington; we are met to celebrate this day. Washington is the\r\nmightiest name of earth long since mightiest in the cause of civil\r\nliberty, still mightiest in moral reformation. On that name no eulogy\r\nis expected. It cannot be. To add brightness to the sun or glory to the\r\nname of Washington is alike impossible. Let none attempt it. In solemn\r\nawe pronounce the name, and in its naked deathless splendor leave it\r\nshining on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, February 25, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 16th instant, announcing that Miss Fanny and\r\nyou are \"no more twain, but one flesh,\" reached me this morning. I\r\nhave no way of telling you how much happiness I wish you both, though I\r\nbelieve you both can conceive it. I feel somewhat jealous of both of you\r\nnow: you will be so exclusively concerned for one another, that I shall\r\nbe forgotten entirely. My acquaintance with Miss Fanny (I call her this,\r\nlest you should think I am speaking of your mother) was too short for me\r\nto reasonably hope to long be remembered by her; and still I am sure I\r\nshall not forget her soon. Try if you cannot remind her of that debt she\r\nowes me--and be sure you do not interfere to prevent her paying it.\r\n\r\nI regret to learn that you have resolved to not return to Illinois.\r\nI shall be very lonesome without you. How miserably things seem to be\r\narranged in this world! If we have no friends, we have no pleasure; and\r\nif we have them, we are sure to lose them, and be doubly pained by the\r\nloss. I did hope she and you would make your home here; but I own I have\r\nno right to insist. You owe obligations to her ten thousand times\r\nmore sacred than you can owe to others, and in that light let them be\r\nrespected and observed. It is natural that she should desire to remain\r\nwith her relatives and friends. As to friends, however, she could not\r\nneed them anywhere: she would have them in abundance here.\r\n\r\nGive my kind remembrance to Mr. Williamson and his family, particularly\r\nMiss Elizabeth; also to your mother, brother, and sisters. Ask little\r\nEliza Davis if she will ride to town with me if I come there again. And\r\nfinally, give Fanny a double reciprocation of all the love she sent me.\r\nWrite me often, and believe me\r\n\r\nYours forever, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S. Poor Easthouse is gone at last. He died awhile before day this\r\nmorning. They say he was very loath to die....\r\n\r\nL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED--ON MARRIAGE CONCERNS\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, February 25,1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--I received yours of the 12th written the day you went down\r\nto William's place, some days since, but delayed answering it till I\r\nshould receive the promised one of the 16th, which came last night.\r\nI opened the letter with intense anxiety and trepidation; so much so,\r\nthat, although it turned out better than I expected, I have hardly yet,\r\nat a distance of ten hours, become calm.\r\n\r\nI tell you, Speed, our forebodings (for which you and I are peculiar)\r\nare all the worst sort of nonsense. I fancied, from the time I received\r\nyour letter of Saturday, that the one of Wednesday was never to come,\r\nand yet it did come, and what is more, it is perfectly clear, both from\r\nits tone and handwriting, that you were much happier, or, if you think\r\nthe term preferable, less miserable, when you wrote it than when you\r\nwrote the last one before. You had so obviously improved at the\r\nvery time I so much fancied you would have grown worse. You say that\r\nsomething indescribably horrible and alarming still haunts you. You will\r\nnot say that three months from now, I will venture. When your nerves\r\nonce get steady now, the whole trouble will be over forever. Nor should\r\nyou become impatient at their being even very slow in becoming steady.\r\nAgain you say, you much fear that that Elysium of which you have dreamed\r\nso much is never to be realized. Well, if it shall not, I dare swear it\r\nwill not be the fault of her who is now your wife. I now have no doubt\r\nthat it is the peculiar misfortune of both you and me to dream dreams of\r\nElysium far exceeding all that anything earthly can realize. Far short\r\nof your dreams as you may be, no woman could do more to realize them\r\nthan that same black-eyed Fanny. If you could but contemplate her\r\nthrough my imagination, it would appear ridiculous to you that any one\r\nshould for a moment think of being unhappy with her. My old father\r\nused to have a saying that \"If you make a bad bargain, hug it all the\r\ntighter\"; and it occurs to me that if the bargain you have just closed\r\ncan possibly be called a bad one, it is certainly the most pleasant one\r\nfor applying that maxim to which my fancy can by any effort picture.\r\n\r\nI write another letter, enclosing this, which you can show her, if she\r\ndesires it. I do this because she would think strangely, perhaps, should\r\nyou tell her that you received no letters from me, or, telling her you\r\ndo, refuse to let her see them. I close this, entertaining the confident\r\nhope that every successive letter I shall have from you (which I here\r\npray may not be few, nor far between) may show you possessing a more\r\nsteady hand and cheerful heart than the last preceding it. As ever, your\r\nfriend, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 27, 1842\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 10th instant was received three or four days\r\nsince. You know I am sincere when I tell you the pleasure its contents\r\ngave me was, and is, inexpressible. As to your farm matter, I have\r\nno sympathy with you. I have no farm, nor ever expect to have, and\r\nconsequently have not studied the subject enough to be much interested\r\nwith it. I can only say that I am glad you are satisfied and pleased\r\nwith it. But on that other subject, to me of the most intense interest\r\nwhether in joy or sorrow, I never had the power to withhold my sympathy\r\nfrom you. It cannot be told how it now thrills me with joy to hear you\r\nsay you are \"far happier than you ever expected to be.\" That much I know\r\nis enough. I know you too well to suppose your expectations were not,\r\nat least, sometimes extravagant, and if the reality exceeds them all, I\r\nsay, Enough, dear Lord. I am not going beyond the truth when I tell you\r\nthat the short space it took me to read your last letter gave me more\r\npleasure than the total sum of all I have enjoyed since the fatal 1st\r\nof January, 1841. Since then it seems to me I should have been entirely\r\nhappy, but for the never-absent idea that there is one still unhappy\r\nwhom I have contributed to make so. That still kills my soul. I cannot\r\nbut reproach myself for even wishing to be happy while she is otherwise.\r\nShe accompanied a large party on the railroad cars to Jacksonville\r\nlast Monday, and on her return spoke, so that I heard of it, of having\r\nenjoyed the trip exceedingly. God be praised for that.\r\n\r\nYou know with what sleepless vigilance I have watched you ever since the\r\ncommencement of your affair; and although I am almost confident it is\r\nuseless, I cannot forbear once more to say that I think it is even yet\r\npossible for your spirits to flag down and leave you miserable. If they\r\nshould, don't fail to remember that they cannot long remain so. One\r\nthing I can tell you which I know you will be glad to hear, and that is\r\nthat I have seen--and scrutinized her feelings as well as I could, and\r\nam fully convinced she is far happier now than she has been for the last\r\nfifteen months past.\r\n\r\nYou will see by the last Sangamon Journal, that I made a temperance\r\nspeech on the 22d of February, which I claim that Fanny and you shall\r\nread as an act of charity to me; for I cannot learn that anybody else\r\nhas read it, or is likely to. Fortunately it is not very long, and I\r\nshall deem it a sufficient compliance with my request if one of you\r\nlistens while the other reads it.\r\n\r\nAs to your Lockridge matter, it is only necessary to say that there\r\nhas been no court since you left, and that the next commences to-morrow\r\nmorning, during which I suppose we cannot fail to get a judgment.\r\n\r\nI wish you would learn of Everett what he would take, over and above a\r\ndischarge for all the trouble we have been at, to take his business out\r\nof our hands and give it to somebody else. It is impossible to collect\r\nmoney on that or any other claim here now; and although you know I am\r\nnot a very petulant man, I declare I am almost out of patience with Mr.\r\nEverett's importunity. It seems like he not only writes all the letters\r\nhe can himself, but gets everybody else in Louisville and vicinity to\r\nbe constantly writing to us about his claim. I have always said that\r\nMr. Everett is a very clever fellow, and I am very sorry he cannot be\r\nobliged; but it does seem to me he ought to know we are interested to\r\ncollect his claim, and therefore would do it if we could.\r\n\r\nI am neither joking nor in a pet when I say we would thank him to\r\ntransfer his business to some other, without any compensation for what\r\nwe have done, provided he will see the court cost paid, for which we are\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nThe sweet violet you inclosed came safely to hand, but it was so dry,\r\nand mashed so flat, that it crumbled to dust at the first attempt\r\nto handle it. The juice that mashed out of it stained a place in the\r\nletter, which I mean to preserve and cherish for the sake of her who\r\nprocured it to be sent. My renewed good wishes to her in particular, and\r\ngenerally to all such of your relations who know me.\r\n\r\nAs ever,\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, July 4, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 16th June was received only a day or two\r\nsince. It was not mailed at Louisville till the 25th. You speak of the\r\ngreat time that has elapsed since I wrote you. Let me explain that. Your\r\nletter reached here a day or two after I started on the circuit. I\r\nwas gone five or six weeks, so that I got the letters only a few weeks\r\nbefore Butler started to your country. I thought it scarcely worth while\r\nto write you the news which he could and would tell you more in detail.\r\nOn his return he told me you would write me soon, and so I waited for\r\nyour letter. As to my having been displeased with your advice, surely\r\nyou know better than that. I know you do, and therefore will not labor\r\nto convince you. True, that subject is painful to me; but it is not your\r\nsilence, or the silence of all the world, that can make me forget it. I\r\nacknowledge the correctness of your advice too; but before I resolve\r\nto do the one thing or the other, I must gain my confidence in my own\r\nability to keep my resolves when they are made. In that ability you know\r\nI once prided myself as the only or chief gem of my character; that gem\r\nI lost--how and where you know too well. I have not yet regained it; and\r\nuntil I do, I cannot trust myself in any matter of much importance. I\r\nbelieve now that had you understood my case at the time as well as I\r\nunderstand yours afterward, by the aid you would have given me I should\r\nhave sailed through clear, but that does not now afford me sufficient\r\nconfidence to begin that or the like of that again.\r\n\r\nYou make a kind acknowledgment of your obligations to me for your\r\npresent happiness. I am pleased with that acknowledgment. But a thousand\r\ntimes more am I pleased to know that you enjoy a degree of happiness\r\nworthy of an acknowledgment. The truth is, I am not sure that there was\r\nany merit with me in the part I took in your difficulty; I was drawn to\r\nit by a fate. If I would I could not have done less than I did. I always\r\nwas superstitious; I believe God made me one of the instruments of\r\nbringing your Fanny and you together, which union I have no doubt He had\r\nfore-ordained. Whatever He designs He will do for me yet. \"Stand still,\r\nand see the salvation of the Lord\" is my text just now. If, as you say,\r\nyou have told Fanny all, I should have no objection to her seeing this\r\nletter, but for its reference to our friend here: let her seeing it\r\ndepend upon whether she has ever known anything of my affairs; and if\r\nshe has not, do not let her.\r\n\r\nI do not think I can come to Kentucky this season. I am so poor and make\r\nso little headway in the world, that I drop back in a month of idleness\r\nas much as I gain in a year's sowing. I should like to visit you again.\r\nI should like to see that \"sis\" of yours that was absent when I was\r\nthere, though I suppose she would run away again if she were to hear I\r\nwas coming.\r\n\r\nMy respects and esteem to all your friends there, and, by your\r\npermission, my love to your Fanny.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER FROM THE LOST TOWNSHIPS\r\n\r\nArticle written by Lincoln for the Sangamon Journal in ridicule of James\r\nShields, who, as State Auditor, had declined to receive State Bank notes\r\nin payment of taxes. The above letter purported to come from a poor\r\nwidow who, though supplied with State Bank paper, could not obtain a\r\nreceipt for her tax bill. This, and another subsequent letter by Mary\r\nTodd, brought about the \"Lincoln-Shields Duel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOST TOWNSHIPS\r\n\r\nAugust 27, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR Mr. PRINTER:\r\n\r\nI see you printed that long letter I sent you a spell ago. I 'm quite\r\nencouraged by it, and can't keep from writing again. I think the\r\nprinting of my letters will be a good thing all round--it will give\r\nme the benefit of being known by the world, and give the world the\r\nadvantage of knowing what's going on in the Lost Townships, and give\r\nyour paper respectability besides. So here comes another. Yesterday\r\nafternoon I hurried through cleaning up the dinner dishes and stepped\r\nover to neighbor S------ to see if his wife Peggy was as well as mout be\r\nexpected, and hear what they called the baby. Well, when I got there and\r\njust turned round the corner of his log cabin, there he was, setting on\r\nthe doorstep reading a newspaper. \"How are you, Jeff?\" says I. He sorter\r\nstarted when he heard me, for he hadn't seen me before. \"Why,\" says he,\r\n\"I 'm mad as the devil, Aunt 'Becca!\" \"What about?\" says I; \"ain't\r\nits hair the right color? None of that nonsense, Jeff; there ain't an\r\nhonester woman in the Lost Townships than...\"--\"Than who?\" says he;\r\n\"what the mischief are you about?\" I began to see I was running the\r\nwrong trail, and so says I, \"Oh! nothing: I guess I was mistaken a\r\nlittle, that's all. But what is it you 're mad about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" says he, \"I've been tugging ever since harvest, getting out wheat\r\nand hauling it to the river to raise State Bank paper enough to pay my\r\ntax this year and a little school debt I owe; and now, just as I 've got\r\nit, here I open this infernal Extra Register, expecting to find it full\r\nof 'Glorious Democratic Victories' and 'High Comb'd Cocks,' when, lo\r\nand behold! I find a set of fellows, calling themselves officers of the\r\nState, have forbidden the tax collectors, and school commissioners to\r\nreceive State paper at all; and so here it is dead on my hands. I don't\r\nnow believe all the plunder I've got will fetch ready cash enough to pay\r\nmy taxes and that school debt.\"\r\n\r\nI was a good deal thunderstruck myself; for that was the first I had\r\nheard of the proclamation, and my old man was pretty much in the same\r\nfix with Jeff. We both stood a moment staring at one another without\r\nknowing what to say. At last says I, \"Mr. S------ let me look at that\r\npaper.\" He handed it to me, when I read the proclamation over.\r\n\r\n\"There now,\" says he, \"did you ever see such a piece of impudence and\r\nimposition as that?\" I saw Jeff was in a good tune for saying some\r\nill-natured things, and so I tho't I would just argue a little on the\r\ncontrary side, and make him rant a spell if I could. \"Why,\" says I,\r\nlooking as dignified and thoughtful as I could, \"it seems pretty tough,\r\nto be sure, to have to raise silver where there's none to be raised; but\r\nthen, you see, 'there will be danger of loss' if it ain't done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Loss! damnation!\" says he. \"I defy Daniel Webster, I defy King Solomon,\r\nI defy the world--I defy--I defy--yes, I defy even you, Aunt 'Becca,\r\nto show how the people can lose anything by paying their taxes in State\r\npaper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" says I, \"you see what the officers of State say about it, and\r\nthey are a desarnin' set of men. But,\" says I, \"I guess you 're mistaken\r\nabout what the proclamation says. It don't say the people will lose\r\nanything by the paper money being taken for taxes. It only says 'there\r\nwill be danger of loss'; and though it is tolerable plain that the\r\npeople can't lose by paying their taxes in something they can get easier\r\nthan silver, instead of having to pay silver; and though it's just as\r\nplain that the State can't lose by taking State Bank paper, however low\r\nit may be, while she owes the bank more than the whole revenue, and\r\ncan pay that paper over on her debt, dollar for dollar;--still there is\r\ndanger of loss to the 'officers of State'; and you know, Jeff, we can't\r\nget along without officers of State.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn officers of State!\" says he; \"that's what Whigs are always\r\nhurrahing for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't swear so, Jeff,\" says I, \"you know I belong to the meetin',\r\nand swearin' hurts my feelings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beg pardon, Aunt 'Becca,\" says he; \"but I do say it's enough to make\r\nDr. Goddard swear, to have tax to pay in silver, for nothing only\r\nthat Ford may get his two thousand a year, and Shields his twenty-four\r\nhundred a year, and Carpenter his sixteen hundred a year, and all\r\nwithout 'danger of loss' by taking it in State paper. Yes, yes: it's\r\nplain enough now what these officers of State mean by 'danger of loss.'\r\nWash, I s'pose, actually lost fifteen hundred dollars out of the three\r\nthousand that two of these 'officers of State' let him steal from the\r\ntreasury, by being compelled to take it in State paper. Wonder if we\r\ndon't have a proclamation before long, commanding us to make up this\r\nloss to Wash in silver.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on till his breath run out, and he had to stop. I\r\ncouldn't think of anything to say just then, and so I begun to look over\r\nthe paper again. \"Ay! here's another proclamation, or something like\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another?\" says Jeff; \"and whose egg is it, pray?\"\r\n\r\nI looked to the bottom of it, and read aloud, \"Your obedient servant,\r\nJames Shields, Auditor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" says Jeff, \"one of them same three fellows again. Well read it,\r\nand let's hear what of it.\"\r\n\r\nI read on till I came to where it says, \"The object of this measure is\r\nto suspend the collection of the revenue for the current year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now stop, now stop!\" says he; \"that's a lie a'ready, and I don't want\r\nto hear of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, maybe not,\" says I.\r\n\r\n\"I say it-is-a-lie. Suspend the collection, indeed! Will the collectors,\r\nthat have taken their oaths to make the collection, dare to end it?\r\nIs there anything in law requiring them to perjure themselves at the\r\nbidding of James Shields?\r\n\r\n\"Will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing\r\nhim instead of all of them, if they should venture to obey him? And\r\nwould he not discover some 'danger of loss,' and be off about the time\r\nit came to taking their places?\r\n\r\n\"And suppose the people attempt to suspend, by refusing to pay; what\r\nthen? The collectors would just jerk up their horses and cows, and the\r\nlike, and sell them to the highest bidder for silver in hand, without\r\nvaluation or redemption. Why, Shields didn't believe that story himself;\r\nit was never meant for the truth. If it was true, why was it not writ\r\ntill five days after the proclamation? Why did n't Carlin and Carpenter\r\nsign it as well as Shields? Answer me that, Aunt 'Becca. I say it's a\r\nlie, and not a well told one at that. It grins out like a copper dollar.\r\nShields is a fool as well as a liar. With him truth is out of the\r\nquestion; and as for getting a good, bright, passable lie out of him,\r\nyou might as well try to strike fire from a cake of tallow. I stick to\r\nit, it's all an infernal Whig lie!\"\r\n\r\n\"A Whig lie! Highty tighty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a Whig lie; and it's just like everything the cursed British Whigs\r\ndo. First they'll do some divilment, and then they'll tell a lie to hide\r\nit. And they don't care how plain a lie it is; they think they can cram\r\nany sort of a one down the throats of the ignorant Locofocos, as they\r\ncall the Democrats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Jeff, you 're crazy: you don't mean to say Shields is a Whig!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, look here! the proclamation is in your own Democratic paper, as\r\nyou call it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it; and what of that? They only printed it to let us Democrats\r\nsee the deviltry the Whigs are at.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but Shields is the auditor of this Loco--I mean this Democratic\r\nState.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he is, and Tyler appointed him to office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tyler appointed him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes (if you must chaw it over), Tyler appointed him; or, if it was n't\r\nhim, it was old Granny Harrison, and that's all one. I tell you, Aunt\r\n'Becca, there's no mistake about his being a Whig. Why, his very looks\r\nshows it; everything about him shows it: if I was deaf and blind, I\r\ncould tell him by the smell. I seed him when I was down in Springfield\r\nlast winter. They had a sort of a gatherin' there one night among the\r\ngrandees, they called a fair. All the gals about town was there, and all\r\nthe handsome widows and married women, finickin' about trying to look\r\nlike gals, tied as tight in the middle, and puffed out at both ends,\r\nlike bundles of fodder that had n't been stacked yet, but wanted\r\nstackin' pretty bad. And then they had tables all around the house\r\nkivered over with [------] caps and pincushions and ten thousand such\r\nlittle knick-knacks, tryin' to sell 'em to the fellows that were bowin',\r\nand scrapin' and kungeerin' about 'em. They would n't let no Democrats\r\nin, for fear they'd disgust the ladies, or scare the little gals, or\r\ndirty the floor. I looked in at the window, and there was this same\r\nfellow Shields floatin' about on the air, without heft or earthly\r\nsubstances, just like a lock of cat fur where cats had been fighting.\r\n\r\n\"He was paying his money to this one, and that one, and t' other one,\r\nand sufferin' great loss because it was n't silver instead of State\r\npaper; and the sweet distress he seemed to be in,--his very features,\r\nin the ecstatic agony of his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly, 'Dear\r\ngirls, it is distressing, but I cannot marry you all. Too well I know\r\nhow much you suffer; but do, do remember, it is not my fault that I am\r\nso handsome and so interesting.'\r\n\r\n\"As this last was expressed by a most exquisite contortion of his face,\r\nhe seized hold of one of their hands, and squeezed, and held on to it\r\nabout a quarter of an hour. 'Oh, my good fellow!' says I to myself, 'if\r\nthat was one of our Democratic gals in the Lost Townships, the way you\r\n'd get a brass pin let into you would be about up to the head.' He a\r\nDemocrat! Fiddlesticks! I tell you, Aunt 'Becca, he's a Whig, and no\r\nmistake; nobody but a Whig could make such a conceity dunce of himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" says I, \"maybe he is; but, if he is, I 'm mistaken the worst\r\nsort. Maybe so, maybe so; but, if I am, I'll suffer by it; I'll be a\r\nDemocrat if it turns out that Shields is a Whig, considerin' you shall\r\nbe a Whig if he turns out a Democrat.\"\r\n\r\n\"A bargain, by jingoes!\" says he; \"but how will we find out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" says I, \"we'll just write and ax the printer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed again!\" says he; \"and by thunder! if it does turn out that\r\nShields is a Democrat, I never will----\"\r\n\r\n\"Jefferson! Jefferson!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want, Peggy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do get through your everlasting clatter some time, and bring me a gourd\r\nof water; the child's been crying for a drink this livelong hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it die, then; it may as well die for water as to be taxed to death\r\nto fatten officers of State.\"\r\n\r\nJeff run off to get the water, though, just like he hadn't been saying\r\nanything spiteful, for he's a raal good-hearted fellow, after all, once\r\nyou get at the foundation of him.\r\n\r\nI walked into the house, and, \"Why, Peggy,\" says I, \"I declare we like\r\nto forgot you altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" says she, \"when a body can't help themselves, everybody soon\r\nforgets 'em; but, thank God! by day after to-morrow I shall be well\r\nenough to milk the cows, and pen the calves, and wring the contrary\r\nones' tails for 'em, and no thanks to nobody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, Peggy,\" says I, and so I sloped, for I seed she was mad\r\nat me for making Jeff neglect her so long.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. Printer, will you be sure to let us know in your next paper\r\nwhether this Shields is a Whig or a Democrat? I don't care about it for\r\nmyself, for I know well enough how it is already; but I want to convince\r\nJeff. It may do some good to let him, and others like him, know who\r\nand what these officers of State are. It may help to send the present\r\nhypocritical set to where they belong, and to fill the places they now\r\ndisgrace with men who will do more work for less pay, and take fewer\r\nairs while they are doing it. It ain't sensible to think that the same\r\nmen who get us in trouble will change their course; and yet it's pretty\r\nplain if some change for the better is not made, it's not long that\r\neither Peggy or I or any of us will have a cow left to milk, or a calf's\r\ntail to wring.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nREBECCA ------.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINVITATION TO HENRY CLAY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug 29, 1842.\r\n\r\nHON. HENRY CLAY, Lexington, Ky.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--We hear you are to visit Indianapolis, Indiana, on the 5th Of\r\nOctober next. If our information in this is correct we hope you will\r\nnot deny us the pleasure of seeing you in our State. We are aware of the\r\ntoil necessarily incident to a journey by one circumstanced as you are;\r\nbut once you have embarked, as you have already determined to do, the\r\ntoil would not be greatly augmented by extending the journey to our\r\ncapital. The season of the year will be most favorable for good roads,\r\nand pleasant weather; and although we cannot but believe you would be\r\nhighly gratified with such a visit to the prairie-land, the pleasure it\r\nwould give us and thousands such as we is beyond all question. You have\r\nnever visited Illinois, or at least this portion of it; and should you\r\nnow yield to our request, we promise you such a reception as shall be\r\nworthy of the man on whom are now turned the fondest hopes of a great\r\nand suffering nation.\r\n\r\nPlease inform us at the earliest convenience whether we may expect you.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n   A. G. HENRY, A. T. BLEDSOE,\r\n   C. BIRCHALL, A. LINCOLN,\r\n   G. M. CABANNISS, ROB'T IRWIN,\r\n   P. A. SAUNDERS, J. M. ALLEN,\r\n   F. N. FRANCIS.\r\n   Executive Committee \"Clay Club.\"\r\n\r\n(Clay's answer, September 6, 1842, declines with thanks.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE ABOUT THE LINCOLN-SHIELDS DUEL.\r\n\r\nTREMONT, September 17, 1842.\r\n\r\nABRA. LINCOLN, ESQ.:--I regret that my absence on public business\r\ncompelled me to postpone a matter of private consideration a little\r\nlonger than I could have desired. It will only be necessary, however, to\r\naccount for it by informing you that I have been to Quincy on business\r\nthat would not admit of delay. I will now state briefly the reasons of\r\nmy troubling you with this communication, the disagreeable nature of\r\nwhich I regret, as I had hoped to avoid any difficulty with any one in\r\nSpringfield while residing there, by endeavoring to conduct myself in\r\nsuch a way amongst both my political friends and opponents as to escape\r\nthe necessity of any. Whilst thus abstaining from giving provocation,\r\nI have become the object of slander, vituperation, and personal abuse,\r\nwhich were I capable of submitting to, I would prove myself worthy of\r\nthe whole of it.\r\n\r\nIn two or three of the last numbers of the Sangamon Journal, articles\r\nof the most personal nature and calculated to degrade me have made their\r\nappearance. On inquiring, I was informed by the editor of that paper,\r\nthrough the medium of my friend General Whitesides, that you are the\r\nauthor of those articles. This information satisfies me that I have\r\nbecome by some means or other the object of your secret hostility. I\r\nwill not take the trouble of inquiring into the reason of all this;\r\nbut I will take the liberty of requiring a full, positive, and\r\nabsolute retraction of all offensive allusions used by you in these\r\ncommunications, in relation to my private character and standing as a\r\nman, as an apology for the insults conveyed in them.\r\n\r\nThis may prevent consequences which no one will regret more than myself.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant, JAS. SHIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. SHIELDS.\r\n\r\nTREMONT, September 17, 1842\r\n\r\nJAS. SHIELDS, ESQ.:--Your note of to-day was handed me by General\r\nWhitesides. In that note you say you have been informed, through the\r\nmedium of the editor of the Journal, that I am the author of certain\r\narticles in that paper which you deem personally abusive of you; and\r\nwithout stopping to inquire whether I really am the author, or to point\r\nout what is offensive in them, you demand an unqualified retraction of\r\nall that is offensive, and then proceed to hint at consequences.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, there is in this so much assumption of facts and so much of\r\nmenace as to consequences, that I cannot submit to answer that note any\r\nfurther than I have, and to add that the consequences to which I suppose\r\nyou allude would be matter of as great regret to me as it possibly could\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. LINCOLN FROM JAS. SHIELDS\r\n\r\nTREMONT, September 17, 1842.\r\n\r\nABRA. LINCOLN, ESQ.:--In reply to my note of this date, you intimate\r\nthat I assume facts and menace consequences, and that you cannot submit\r\nto answer it further. As now, sir, you desire it, I will be a little\r\nmore particular. The editor of the Sangamon Journal gave me to\r\nunderstand that you are the author of an article which appeared, I\r\nthink, in that paper of the 2d September instant, headed \"The Lost\r\nTownships,\" and signed Rebecca or 'Becca. I would therefore take the\r\nliberty of asking whether you are the author of said article, or any\r\nother over the same signature which has appeared in any of the late\r\nnumbers of that paper. If so, I repeat my request of an absolute\r\nretraction of all offensive allusions contained therein in relation to\r\nmy private character and standing. If you are not the author of any of\r\nthese articles, your denial will be sufficient. I will say further, it\r\nis not my intention to menace, but to do myself justice.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant, JAS. SHIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM OF INSTRUCTIONS TO E. H. MERRYMAN,\r\n\r\nLincoln's Second,\r\n\r\nSeptember 19, 1842.\r\n\r\nIn case Whitesides shall signify a wish to adjust this affair without\r\nfurther difficulty, let him know that if the present papers be\r\nwithdrawn, and a note from Mr. Shields asking to know if I am the author\r\nof the articles of which he complains, and asking that I shall make him\r\ngentlemanly satisfaction if I am the author, and this without menace, or\r\ndictation as to what that satisfaction shall be, a pledge is made that\r\nthe following answer shall be given:\r\n\r\n\"I did write the 'Lost Townships' letter which appeared in the Journal\r\nof the 2d instant, but had no participation in any form in any other\r\narticle alluding to you. I wrote that wholly for political effect--I had\r\nno intention of injuring your personal or private character or standing\r\nas a man or a gentleman; and I did not then think, and do not now think,\r\nthat that article could produce or has produced that effect against you;\r\nand had I anticipated such an effect I would have forborne to write it.\r\nAnd I will add that your conduct toward me, so far as I know, had always\r\nbeen gentlemanly; and that I had no personal pique against you, and no\r\ncause for any.\"\r\n\r\nIf this should be done, I leave it with you to arrange what shall\r\nand what shall not be published. If nothing like this is done, the\r\npreliminaries of the fight are to be--\r\n\r\nFirst. Weapons: Cavalry broadswords of the largest size, precisely\r\nequal in all respects, and such as now used by the cavalry company at\r\nJacksonville.\r\n\r\nSecond. Position: A plank ten feet long, and from nine to twelve inches\r\nbroad, to be firmly fixed on edge, on the ground, as the line between\r\nus, which neither is to pass his foot over upon forfeit of his life.\r\nNext a line drawn on the ground on either side of said plank and\r\nparallel with it, each at the distance of the whole length of the sword\r\nand three feet additional from the plank; and the passing of his own\r\nsuch line by either party during the fight shall be deemed a surrender\r\nof the contest.\r\n\r\nThird. Time: On Thursday evening at five o'clock, if you can get it so;\r\nbut in no case to be at a greater distance of time than Friday evening\r\nat five o'clock.\r\n\r\nFourth. Place: Within three miles of Alton, on the opposite side of the\r\nriver, the particular spot to be agreed on by you.\r\n\r\nAny preliminary details coming within the above rules you are at liberty\r\nto make at your discretion; but you are in no case to swerve from these\r\nrules, or to pass beyond their limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, October 4, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--You have heard of my duel with Shields, and I have now\r\nto inform you that the dueling business still rages in this city. Day\r\nbefore yesterday Shields challenged Butler, who accepted, and proposed\r\nfighting next morning at sunrise in Bob Allen's meadow, one hundred\r\nyards' distance, with rifles. To this Whitesides, Shields's second, said\r\n\"No,\" because of the law. Thus ended duel No. 2. Yesterday Whitesides\r\nchose to consider himself insulted by Dr. Merryman, so sent him a kind\r\nof quasi-challenge, inviting him to meet him at the Planter's House in\r\nSt. Louis on the next Friday, to settle their difficulty. Merryman made\r\nme his friend, and sent Whitesides a note, inquiring to know if he meant\r\nhis note as a challenge, and if so, that he would, according to the\r\nlaw in such case made and provided, prescribe the terms of the meeting.\r\nWhitesides returned for answer that if Merryman would meet him at the\r\nPlanter's House as desired, he would challenge him. Merryman replied in\r\na note that he denied Whitesides's right to dictate time and place, but\r\nthat he (Merryman) would waive the question of time, and meet him at\r\nLouisiana, Missouri. Upon my presenting this note to Whitesides and\r\nstating verbally its contents, he declined receiving it, saying he had\r\nbusiness in St. Louis, and it was as near as Louisiana. Merryman\r\nthen directed me to notify Whitesides that he should publish the\r\ncorrespondence between them, with such comments as he thought fit. This\r\nI did. Thus it stood at bedtime last night. This morning Whitesides, by\r\nhis friend Shields, is praying for a new trial, on the ground that\r\nhe was mistaken in Merryman's proposition to meet him at Louisiana,\r\nMissouri, thinking it was the State of Louisiana. This Merryman hoots\r\nat, and is preparing his publication; while the town is in a ferment,\r\nand a street fight somewhat anticipated.\r\n\r\nBut I began this letter not for what I have been writing, but to\r\nsay something on that subject which you know to be of such infinite\r\nsolicitude to me. The immense sufferings you endured from the first days\r\nof September till the middle of February you never tried to conceal from\r\nme, and I well understood. You have now been the husband of a lovely\r\nwoman nearly eight months. That you are happier now than the day you\r\nmarried her I well know, for without you could not be living. But I have\r\nyour word for it, too, and the returning elasticity of spirits which is\r\nmanifested in your letters. But I want to ask a close question, \"Are\r\nyou now in feeling as well as judgment glad that you are married as you\r\nare?\" From anybody but me this would be an impudent question, not to\r\nbe tolerated; but I know you will pardon it in me. Please answer it\r\nquickly, as I am impatient to know. I have sent my love to your Fanny so\r\noften, I fear she is getting tired of it. However, I venture to tender\r\nit again.\r\n\r\nYours forever,\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES S. IRWIN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, November 2, 1842.\r\n\r\nJAS. S. IRWIN ESQ.:\r\n\r\nOwing to my absence, yours of the 22nd ult. was not received till this\r\nmoment. Judge Logan and myself are willing to attend to any business\r\nin the Supreme Court you may send us. As to fees, it is impossible to\r\nestablish a rule that will apply in all, or even a great many cases.\r\nWe believe we are never accused of being very unreasonable in this\r\nparticular; and we would always be easily satisfied, provided we could\r\nsee the money--but whatever fees we earn at a distance, if not paid\r\nbefore, we have noticed, we never hear of after the work is done. We,\r\ntherefore, are growing a little sensitive on that point.\r\n\r\nYours etc.,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1843\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS AT A WHIG MEETING AT SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, MARCH 1, 1843.\r\n\r\nThe object of the meeting was stated by Mr. Lincoln of Springfield, who\r\noffered the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\nResolved, That a tariff of duties on imported goods, producing\r\nsufficient revenue for the payment of the necessary expenditures of the\r\nNational Government, and so adjusted as to protect American industry, is\r\nindispensably necessary to the prosperity of the American people.\r\n\r\nResolved, That we are opposed to direct taxation for the support of the\r\nNational Government.\r\n\r\nResolved, That a national bank, properly restricted, is highly necessary\r\nand proper to the establishment and maintenance of a sound currency, and\r\nfor the cheap and safe collection, keeping, and disbursing of the public\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the\r\npublic lands, upon the principles of Mr. Clay's bill, accords with the\r\nbest interests of the nation, and particularly with those of the State\r\nof Illinois.\r\n\r\nResolved, That we recommend to the Whigs of each Congressional district\r\nof the State to nominate and support at the approaching election a\r\ncandidate of their own principles, regardless of the chances of success.\r\n\r\nResolved, That we recommend to the Whigs of all portions of the State\r\nto adopt and rigidly adhere to the convention system of nominating\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nResolved, That we recommend to the Whigs of each Congressional district\r\nto hold a district convention on or before the first Monday of May next,\r\nto be composed of a number of delegates from each county equal to double\r\nthe number of its representatives in the General Assembly, provided,\r\neach county shall have at least one delegate. Said delegates to be\r\nchosen by primary meetings of the Whigs, at such times and places as\r\nthey in their respective counties may see fit. Said district conventions\r\neach to nominate one candidate for Congress, and one delegate to\r\na national convention for the purpose of nominating candidates for\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States. The seven delegates\r\nso nominated to a national convention to have power to add two delegates\r\nto their own number, and to fill all vacancies.\r\n\r\nResolved, That A. T. Bledsoe, S. T. Logan, and A. Lincoln be appointed a\r\ncommittee to prepare an address to the people of the State.\r\n\r\nResolved, That N. W. Edwards, A. G. Henry, James H. Matheny, John\r\nC. Doremus, and James C. Conkling be appointed a Whig Central State\r\nCommittee, with authority to fill any vacancy that may occur in the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR FROM WHIG COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nAddress to the People of Illinois.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:-By a resolution of a meeting of such of the Whigs of\r\nthe State as are now at Springfield, we, the undersigned, were appointed\r\nto prepare an address to you. The performance of that task we now\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\nSeveral resolutions were adopted by the meeting; and the chief object of\r\nthis address is to show briefly the reasons for their adoption.\r\n\r\nThe first of those resolutions declares a tariff of duties upon foreign\r\nimportations, producing sufficient revenue for the support of the\r\nGeneral Government, and so adjusted as to protect American industry, to\r\nbe indispensably necessary to the prosperity of the American people;\r\nand the second declares direct taxation for a national revenue to\r\nbe improper. Those two resolutions are kindred in their nature, and\r\ntherefore proper and convenient to be considered together. The question\r\nof protection is a subject entirely too broad to be crowded into a\r\nfew pages only, together with several other subjects. On that point we\r\ntherefore content ourselves with giving the following extracts from\r\nthe writings of Mr. Jefferson, General Jackson, and the speech of Mr.\r\nCalhoun:\r\n\r\n\"To be independent for the comforts of life, we must fabricate them\r\nourselves. We must now place the manufacturer by the side of the\r\nagriculturalist. The grand inquiry now is, Shall we make our own\r\ncomforts, or go without them at the will of a foreign nation? He,\r\ntherefore, who is now against domestic manufactures must be for reducing\r\nus either to dependence on that foreign nation, or to be clothed in\r\nskins and to live like wild beasts in dens and caverns. I am not one of\r\nthose; experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary\r\nto our independence as to our comfort.\" Letter of Mr. Jefferson to\r\nBenjamin Austin.\r\n\r\n\"I ask, What is the real situation of the agriculturalist? Where has the\r\nAmerican farmer a market for his surplus produce? Except for cotton, he\r\nhas neither a foreign nor a home market. Does not this clearly prove,\r\nwhen there is no market at home or abroad, that there [is] too much\r\nlabor employed in agriculture? Common sense at once points out the\r\nremedy. Take from agriculture six hundred thousand men, women, and\r\nchildren, and you will at once give a market for more breadstuffs than\r\nall Europe now furnishes. In short, we have been too long subject to the\r\npolicy of British merchants. It is time we should become a little\r\nmore Americanized, and instead of feeding the paupers and laborers\r\nof England, feed our own; or else in a short time, by continuing our\r\npresent policy, we shall all be rendered paupers ourselves.\"--General\r\nJackson's Letter to Dr. Coleman.\r\n\r\n\"When our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon\r\nwill be, under the fostering care of government, the farmer will find\r\na ready market for his surplus produce, and--what is of equal\r\nconsequence--a certain and cheap supply of all he wants; his prosperity\r\nwill diffuse itself to every class of the community.\" Speech of Hon. J.\r\nC. Calhoun on the Tariff.\r\n\r\nThe question of revenue we will now briefly consider. For several\r\nyears past the revenues of the government have been unequal to its\r\nexpenditures, and consequently loan after loan, sometimes direct and\r\nsometimes indirect in form, has been resorted to. By this means a\r\nnew national debt has been created, and is still growing on us with\r\na rapidity fearful to contemplate--a rapidity only reasonably to be\r\nexpected in time of war. This state of things has been produced by a\r\nprevailing unwillingness either to increase the tariff or resort to\r\ndirect taxation. But the one or the other must come. Coming expenditures\r\nmust be met, and the present debt must be paid; and money cannot always\r\nbe borrowed for these objects. The system of loans is but temporary in\r\nits nature, and must soon explode. It is a system not only ruinous while\r\nit lasts, but one that must soon fail and leave us destitute. As an\r\nindividual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon finds his original\r\nmeans devoured by interest, and, next, no one left to borrow from, so\r\nmust it be with a government.\r\n\r\nWe repeat, then, that a tariff sufficient for revenue, or a direct tax,\r\nmust soon be resorted to; and, indeed, we believe this alternative is\r\nnow denied by no one. But which system shall be adopted? Some of our\r\nopponents, in theory, admit the propriety of a tariff sufficient for\r\na revenue, but even they will not in practice vote for such a tariff;\r\nwhile others boldly advocate direct taxation. Inasmuch, therefore, as\r\nsome of them boldly advocate direct taxation, and all the rest--or so\r\nnearly all as to make exceptions needless--refuse to adopt the tariff,\r\nwe think it is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates\r\nof direct taxation. Indeed, we believe they are only delaying an open\r\navowal of the system till they can assure themselves that the people\r\nwill tolerate it. Let us, then, briefly compare the two systems. The\r\ntariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in\r\nlarge parcels at a few commercial points, will require comparatively few\r\nofficers in their collection; while by the direct-tax system the land\r\nmust be literally covered with assessors and collectors, going forth\r\nlike swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade of grass and\r\nother green thing. And, again, by the tariff system the whole revenue is\r\npaid by the consumers of foreign goods, and those chiefly the luxuries,\r\nand not the necessaries, of life. By this system the man who contents\r\nhimself to live upon the products of his own country pays nothing at\r\nall. And surely that country is extensive enough, and its products\r\nabundant and varied enough, to answer all the real wants of its people.\r\nIn short, by this system the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on\r\nthe wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many\r\nwho live at home, and upon home products, go entirely free. By the\r\ndirect-tax system none can escape. However strictly the citizen may\r\nexclude from his premises all foreign luxuries,--fine cloths, fine\r\nsilks, rich wines, golden chains, and diamond rings,--still, for\r\nthe possession of his house, his barn, and his homespun, he is to be\r\nperpetually haunted and harassed by the tax-gatherer. With these views\r\nwe leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are the more\r\ntruly democratic on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe third resolution declares the necessity and propriety of a national\r\nbank. During the last fifty years so much has been said and written both\r\nas to the constitutionality and expediency of such an institution, that\r\nwe could not hope to improve in the least on former discussions of the\r\nsubject, were we to undertake it. We, therefore, upon the question of\r\nconstitutionality content ourselves with remarking the facts that the\r\nfirst national bank was established chiefly by the same men who formed\r\nthe Constitution, at a time when that instrument was but two years old,\r\nand receiving the sanction, as President, of the immortal Washington;\r\nthat the second received the sanction, as President, of Mr. Madison,\r\nto whom common consent has awarded the proud title of \"Father of the\r\nConstitution\"; and subsequently the sanction of the Supreme Court, the\r\nmost enlightened judicial tribunal in the world. Upon the question of\r\nexpediency, we only ask you to examine the history of the times during\r\nthe existence of the two banks, and compare those times with the\r\nmiserable present.\r\n\r\nThe fourth resolution declares the expediency of Mr. Clay's land bill.\r\nMuch incomprehensible jargon is often used against the constitutionality\r\nof this measure. We forbear, in this place, attempting an answer to it,\r\nsimply because, in our opinion, those who urge it are through party\r\nzeal resolved not to see or acknowledge the truth. The question of\r\nexpediency, at least so far as Illinois is concerned, seems to us the\r\nclearest imaginable. By the bill we are to receive annually a large sum\r\nof money, no part of which we otherwise receive. The precise annual sum\r\ncannot be known in advance; it doubtless will vary in different years.\r\nStill it is something to know that in the last year--a year of almost\r\nunparalleled pecuniary pressure--it amounted to more than forty thousand\r\ndollars. This annual income, in the midst of our almost insupportable\r\ndifficulties, in the days of our severest necessity, our political\r\nopponents are furiously resolving to take and keep from us. And for\r\nwhat? Many silly reasons are given, as is usual in cases where a single\r\ngood one is not to be found. One is that by giving us the proceeds\r\nof the lands we impoverish the national treasury, and thereby render\r\nnecessary an increase of the tariff. This may be true; but if so, the\r\namount of it only is that those whose pride, whose abundance of means,\r\nprompt them to spurn the manufactures of our country, and to strut in\r\nBritish cloaks and coats and pantaloons, may have to pay a few cents\r\nmore on the yard for the cloth that makes them. A terrible evil, truly,\r\nto the Illinois farmer, who never wore, nor ever expects to wear, a\r\nsingle yard of British goods in his whole life. Another of their reasons\r\nis that by the passage and continuance of Mr. Clay's bill, we prevent\r\nthe passage of a bill which would give us more. This, if it were sound\r\nin itself, is waging destructive war with the former position; for if\r\nMr. Clay's bill impoverishes the treasury too much, what shall be said\r\nof one that impoverishes it still more? But it is not sound in itself.\r\nIt is not true that Mr. Clay's bill prevents the passage of one more\r\nfavorable to us of the new States. Considering the strength and opposite\r\ninterest of the old States, the wonder is that they ever permitted one\r\nto pass so favorable as Mr. Clay's. The last twenty-odd years' efforts\r\nto reduce the price of the lands, and to pass graduation bills and\r\ncession bills, prove the assertion to be true; and if there were no\r\nexperience in support of it, the reason itself is plain. The States\r\nin which none, or few, of the public lands lie, and those consequently\r\ninterested against parting with them except for the best price, are\r\nthe majority; and a moment's reflection will show that they must ever\r\ncontinue the majority, because by the time one of the original new\r\nStates (Ohio, for example) becomes populous and gets weight in Congress,\r\nthe public lands in her limits are so nearly sold out that in every\r\npoint material to this question she becomes an old State. She does not\r\nwish the price reduced, because there is none left for her citizens\r\nto buy; she does not wish them ceded to the States in which they lie,\r\nbecause they no longer lie in her limits, and she will get nothing\r\nby the cession. In the nature of things, the States interested in\r\nthe reduction of price, in graduation, in cession, and in all similar\r\nprojects, never can be the majority. Nor is there reason to hope that\r\nany of them can ever succeed as a Democratic party measure, because we\r\nhave heretofore seen that party in full power, year after year,\r\nwith many of their leaders making loud professions in favor of these\r\nprojects, and yet doing nothing. What reason, then, is there to believe\r\nthey will hereafter do better? In every light in which we can view this\r\nquestion, it amounts simply to this: Shall we accept our share of the\r\nproceeds under Mr. Clay's bill, or shall we rather reject that and get\r\nnothing?\r\n\r\nThe fifth resolution recommends that a Whig candidate for Congress be\r\nrun in every district, regardless of the chances of success. We are\r\naware that it is sometimes a temporary gratification, when a friend\r\ncannot succeed, to be able to choose between opponents; but we believe\r\nthat that gratification is the seed-time which never fails to be\r\nfollowed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness. By this policy we\r\nentangle ourselves. By voting for our opponents, such of us as do it\r\nin some measure estop ourselves to complain of their acts, however\r\nglaringly wrong we may believe them to be. By this policy no one portion\r\nof our friends can ever be certain as to what course another portion\r\nmay adopt; and by this want of mutual and perfect understanding our\r\npolitical identity is partially frittered away and lost. And, again,\r\nthose who are thus elected by our aid ever become our bitterest\r\npersecutors. Take a few prominent examples. In 1830 Reynolds was elected\r\nGovernor; in 1835 we exerted our whole strength to elect Judge Young\r\nto the United States Senate, which effort, though failing, gave him the\r\nprominence that subsequently elected him; in 1836 General Ewing, was so\r\nelected to the United States Senate; and yet let us ask what three men\r\nhave been more perseveringly vindictive in their assaults upon all our\r\nmen and measures than they? During the last summer the whole State\r\nwas covered with pamphlet editions of misrepresentations against us,\r\nmethodized into chapters and verses, written by two of these same\r\nmen,--Reynolds and Young, in which they did not stop at charging us with\r\nerror merely, but roundly denounced us as the designing enemies of\r\nhuman liberty, itself. If it be the will of Heaven that such men shall\r\npolitically live, be it so; but never, never again permit them to draw a\r\nparticle of their sustenance from us.\r\n\r\nThe sixth resolution recommends the adoption of the convention system\r\nfor the nomination of candidates. This we believe to be of the very\r\nfirst importance. Whether the system is right in itself we do not stop\r\nto inquire; contenting ourselves with trying to show that, while our\r\nopponents use it, it is madness in us not to defend ourselves with\r\nit. Experience has shown that we cannot successfully defend ourselves\r\nwithout it. For examples, look at the elections of last year. Our\r\ncandidate for governor, with the approbation of a large portion of the\r\nparty, took the field without a nomination, and in open opposition to\r\nthe system. Wherever in the counties the Whigs had held conventions and\r\nnominated candidates for the Legislature, the aspirants who were not\r\nnominated were induced to rebel against the nominations, and to become\r\ncandidates, as is said, \"on their own hook.\" And, go where you would\r\ninto a large Whig county, you were sure to find the Whigs not contending\r\nshoulder to shoulder against the common enemy, but divided into\r\nfactions, and fighting furiously with one another. The election came,\r\nand what was the result? The governor beaten, the Whig vote being\r\ndecreased many thousands since 1840, although the Democratic vote\r\nhad not increased any. Beaten almost everywhere for members of the\r\nLegislature,--Tazewell, with her four hundred Whig majority, sending a\r\ndelegation half Democratic; Vermillion, with her five hundred, doing\r\nthe same; Coles, with her four hundred, sending two out of three; and\r\nMorgan, with her two hundred and fifty, sending three out of four,--and\r\nthis to say nothing of the numerous other less glaring examples; the\r\nwhole winding up with the aggregate number of twenty-seven Democratic\r\nrepresentatives sent from Whig counties. As to the senators, too, the\r\nresult was of the same character. And it is most worthy to be remembered\r\nthat of all the Whigs in the State who ran against the regular nominees,\r\na single one only was elected. Although they succeeded in defeating\r\nthe nominees almost by scores, they too were defeated, and the spoils\r\nchucklingly borne off by the common enemy.\r\n\r\nWe do not mention the fact of many of the Whigs opposing the convention\r\nsystem heretofore for the purpose of censuring them. Far from it.\r\nWe expressly protest against such a conclusion. We know they were\r\ngenerally, perhaps universally, as good and true Whigs as we ourselves\r\nclaim to be.\r\n\r\nWe mention it merely to draw attention to the disastrous result it\r\nproduced, as an example forever hereafter to be avoided. That \"union is\r\nstrength\" is a truth that has been known, illustrated, and declared in\r\nvarious ways and forms in all ages of the world. That great fabulist and\r\nphilosopher Aesop illustrated it by his fable of the bundle of sticks;\r\nand he whose wisdom surpasses that of all philosophers has declared\r\nthat \"a house divided against itself cannot stand.\" It is to induce our\r\nfriends to act upon this important and universally acknowledged truth\r\nthat we urge the adoption of the convention system. Reflection will\r\nprove that there is no other way of practically applying it. In its\r\napplication we know there will be incidents temporarily painful; but,\r\nafter all, those incidents will be fewer and less intense with than\r\nwithout the system. If two friends aspire to the same office it is\r\ncertain that both cannot succeed. Would it not, then, be much less\r\npainful to have the question decided by mutual friends some time before,\r\nthan to snarl and quarrel until the day of election, and then both be\r\nbeaten by the common enemy?\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, we think proper to remark that we do not\r\nunderstand the resolution as intended to recommend the application of\r\nthe convention system to the nomination of candidates for the small\r\noffices no way connected with politics; though we must say we do not\r\nperceive that such an application of it would be wrong.\r\n\r\nThe seventh resolution recommends the holding of district conventions\r\nin May next, for the purpose of nominating candidates for Congress. The\r\npropriety of this rests upon the same reasons with that of the sixth,\r\nand therefore needs no further discussion.\r\n\r\nThe eighth and ninth also relate merely to the practical application of\r\nthe foregoing, and therefore need no discussion.\r\n\r\nBefore closing, permit us to add a few reflections on the present\r\ncondition and future prospects of the Whig party. In almost all the\r\nStates we have fallen into the minority, and despondency seems to\r\nprevail universally among us. Is there just cause for this? In 1840 we\r\ncarried the nation by more than a hundred and forty thousand majority.\r\nOur opponents charged that we did it by fraudulent voting; but whatever\r\nthey may have believed, we know the charge to be untrue. Where, now, is\r\nthat mighty host? Have they gone over to the enemy? Let the results of\r\nthe late elections answer. Every State which has fallen off from the\r\nWhig cause since 1840 has done so not by giving more Democratic votes\r\nthan they did then, but by giving fewer Whig. Bouck, who was elected\r\nDemocratic Governor of New York last fall by more than 15,000 majority,\r\nhad not then as many votes as he had in 1840, when he was beaten by\r\nseven or eight thousand. And so has it been in all the other States\r\nwhich have fallen away from our cause. From this it is evident that tens\r\nof thousands in the late elections have not voted at all. Who and what\r\nare they? is an important question, as respects the future. They can\r\ncome forward and give us the victory again. That all, or nearly all, of\r\nthem are Whigs is most apparent. Our opponents, stung to madness by\r\nthe defeat of 1840, have ever since rallied with more than their usual\r\nunanimity. It has not been they that have been kept from the polls.\r\nThese facts show what the result must be, once the people again rally\r\nin their entire strength. Proclaim these facts, and predict this result;\r\nand although unthinking opponents may smile at us, the sagacious ones\r\nwill \"believe and tremble.\" And why shall the Whigs not all rally again?\r\nAre their principles less dear now than in 1840? Have any of their\r\ndoctrines since then been discovered to be untrue? It is true, the\r\nvictory of 1840 did not produce the happy results anticipated; but it\r\nis equally true, as we believe, that the unfortunate death of General\r\nHarrison was the cause of the failure. It was not the election of\r\nGeneral Harrison that was expected to produce happy effects, but the\r\nmeasures to be adopted by his administration. By means of his death,\r\nand the unexpected course of his successor, those measures were never\r\nadopted. How could the fruits follow? The consequences we always\r\npredicted would follow the failure of those measures have followed, and\r\nare now upon us in all their horrors. By the course of Mr. Tyler the\r\npolicy of our opponents has continued in operation, still leaving them\r\nwith the advantage of charging all its evils upon us as the results of\r\na Whig administration. Let none be deceived by this somewhat plausible,\r\nthough entirely false charge. If they ask us for the sufficient and\r\nsound currency we promised, let them be answered that we only promised\r\nit through the medium of a national bank, which they, aided by Mr.\r\nTyler, prevented our establishing. And let them be reminded, too, that\r\ntheir own policy in relation to the currency has all the time been, and\r\nstill is, in full operation. Let us then again come forth in our might,\r\nand by a second victory accomplish that which death prevented in the\r\nfirst. We can do it. When did the Whigs ever fail if they were fully\r\naroused and united? Even in single States, under such circumstances,\r\ndefeat seldom overtakes them. Call to mind the contested elections\r\nwithin the last few years, and particularly those of Moore and Letcher\r\nfrom Kentucky, Newland and Graham from North Carolina, and the famous\r\nNew Jersey case. In all these districts Locofocoism had stalked\r\nomnipotent before; but when the whole people were aroused by its\r\nenormities on those occasions, they put it down, never to rise again.\r\n\r\nWe declare it to be our solemn conviction, that the Whigs are always a\r\nmajority of this nation; and that to make them always successful needs\r\nbut to get them all to the polls and to vote unitedly. This is the great\r\ndesideratum. Let us make every effort to attain it. At every election,\r\nlet every Whig act as though he knew the result to depend upon his\r\naction. In the great contest of 1840 some more than twenty one hundred\r\nthousand votes were cast, and so surely as there shall be that many,\r\nwith the ordinary increase added, cast in 1844 that surely will a Whig\r\nbe elected President of the United States.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. S. T. LOGAN. A. T. BLEDSOE.\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BENNETT.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 7, 1843.\r\n\r\nFRIEND BENNETT:\r\n\r\nYour letter of this day was handed me by Mr. Miles. It is too late now\r\nto effect the object you desire. On yesterday morning the most of the\r\nWhig members from this district got together and agreed to hold the\r\nconvention at Tremont in Tazewell County. I am sorry to hear that any\r\nof the Whigs of your county, or indeed of any county, should longer\r\nbe against conventions. On last Wednesday evening a meeting of all the\r\nWhigs then here from all parts of the State was held, and the question\r\nof the propriety of conventions was brought up and fully discussed, and\r\nat the end of the discussion a resolution recommending the system of\r\nconventions to all the Whigs of the State was unanimously adopted.\r\nOther resolutions were also passed, all of which will appear in the next\r\nJournal. The meeting also appointed a committee to draft an address\r\nto the people of the State, which address will also appear in the next\r\njournal.\r\n\r\nIn it you will find a brief argument in favor of conventions--and\r\nalthough I wrote it myself I will say to you that it is conclusive upon\r\nthe point and can not be reasonably answered. The right way for you to\r\ndo is hold your meeting and appoint delegates any how, and if there be\r\nany who will not take part, let it be so. The matter will work so well\r\nthis time that even they who now oppose will come in next time.\r\n\r\nThe convention is to be held at Tremont on the 5th of April and\r\naccording to the rule we have adopted your county is to have\r\ndelegates--being double your representation.\r\n\r\nIf there be any good Whig who is disposed to stick out against\r\nconventions get him at least to read the arguement in their favor in the\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 24, 1843.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--We had a meeting of the Whigs of the county here on last\r\nMonday to appoint delegates to a district convention; and Baker beat me,\r\nand got the delegation instructed to go for him. The meeting, in spite\r\nof my attempt to decline it, appointed me one of the delegates; so that\r\nin getting Baker the nomination I shall be fixed a good deal like a\r\nfellow who is made a groomsman to a man that has cut him out and is\r\nmarrying his own dear \"gal.\" About the prospects of your having a\r\nnamesake at our town, can't say exactly yet.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MARTIN M. MORRIS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., March 26, 1843.\r\n\r\nFRIEND MORRIS:\r\n\r\nYour letter of the a 3 d, was received on yesterday morning, and for\r\nwhich (instead of an excuse, which you thought proper to ask) I tender\r\nyou my sincere thanks. It is truly gratifying to me to learn that, while\r\nthe people of Sangamon have cast me off, my old friends of Menard, who\r\nhave known me longest and best, stick to me. It would astonish, if\r\nnot amuse, the older citizens to learn that I (a stranger, friendless,\r\nuneducated, penniless boy, working on a flatboat at ten dollars per\r\nmonth) have been put down here as the candidate of pride, wealth, and\r\naristocratic family distinction. Yet so, chiefly, it was. There was,\r\ntoo, the strangest combination of church influence against me. Baker is\r\na Campbellite; and therefore, as I suppose, with few exceptions got all\r\nthat church. My wife has some relations in the Presbyterian churches,\r\nand some with the Episcopal churches; and therefore, wherever it would\r\ntell, I was set down as either the one or the other, while it was\r\neverywhere contended that no Christian ought to go for me, because I\r\nbelonged to no church, was suspected of being a deist, and had talked\r\nabout fighting a duel. With all these things, Baker, of course, had\r\nnothing to do. Nor do I complain of them. As to his own church going\r\nfor him, I think that was right enough, and as to the influences I\r\nhave spoken of in the other, though they were very strong, it would be\r\ngrossly untrue and unjust to charge that they acted upon them in a body\r\nor were very near so. I only mean that those influences levied a tax\r\nof a considerable per cent. upon my strength throughout the religious\r\ncontroversy. But enough of this.\r\n\r\nYou say that in choosing a candidate for Congress you have an equal\r\nright with Sangamon, and in this you are undoubtedly correct. In\r\nagreeing to withdraw if the Whigs of Sangamon should go against me, I\r\ndid not mean that they alone were worth consulting, but that if she,\r\nwith her heavy delegation, should be against me, it would be impossible\r\nfor me to succeed, and therefore I had as well decline. And in relation\r\nto Menard having rights, permit me fully to recognize them, and to\r\nexpress the opinion that, if she and Mason act circumspectly, they will\r\nin the convention be able so far to enforce their rights as to decide\r\nabsolutely which one of the candidates shall be successful. Let me show\r\nthe reason of this. Hardin, or some other Morgan candidate, will get\r\nPutnam, Marshall, Woodford, Tazewell, and Logan--making sixteen. Then\r\nyou and Mason, having three, can give the victory to either side.\r\n\r\nYou say you shall instruct your delegates for me, unless I object. I\r\ncertainly shall not object. That would be too pleasant a compliment for\r\nme to tread in the dust. And besides, if anything should happen (which,\r\nhowever, is not probable) by which Baker should be thrown out of the\r\nfight, I would be at liberty to accept the nomination if I could get\r\nit. I do, however, feel myself bound not to hinder him in any way from\r\ngetting the nomination. I should despise myself were I to attempt it.\r\nI think, then, it would be proper for your meeting to appoint three\r\ndelegates and to instruct them to go for some one as the first choice,\r\nsome one else as a second, and perhaps some one as a third; and if in\r\nthose instructions I were named as the first choice, it would gratify me\r\nvery much. If you wish to hold the balance of power, it is important for\r\nyou to attend to and secure the vote of Mason also: You should be sure\r\nto have men appointed delegates that you know you can safely confide in.\r\nIf yourself and James Short were appointed from your county, all would\r\nbe safe; but whether Jim's woman affair a year ago might not be in the\r\nway of his appointment is a question. I don't know whether you know it,\r\nbut I know him to be as honorable a man as there is in the world. You\r\nhave my permission, and even request, to show this letter to Short; but\r\nto no one else, unless it be a very particular friend who you know will\r\nnot speak of it.\r\n\r\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S Will you write me again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MARTIN M. MORRIS.\r\n\r\nApril 14, 1843.\r\n\r\nFRIEND MORRIS:\r\n\r\nI have heard it intimated that Baker has been attempting to get you or\r\nMiles, or both of you, to violate the instructions of the meeting that\r\nappointed you, and to go for him. I have insisted, and still insist,\r\nthat this cannot be true. Surely Baker would not do the like. As well\r\nmight Hardin ask me to vote for him in the convention. Again, it is said\r\nthere will be an attempt to get up instructions in your county requiring\r\nyou to go for Baker. This is all wrong. Upon the same rule, Why\r\nmight not I fly from the decision against me in Sangamon, and get up\r\ninstructions to their delegates to go for me? There are at least twelve\r\nhundred Whigs in the county that took no part, and yet I would as soon\r\nput my head in the fire as to attempt it. Besides, if any one should get\r\nthe nomination by such extraordinary means, all harmony in the district\r\nwould inevitably be lost. Honest Whigs (and very nearly all of them\r\nare honest) would not quietly abide such enormities. I repeat, such an\r\nattempt on Baker's part cannot be true. Write me at Springfield how the\r\nmatter is. Don't show or speak of this letter.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEN. J. J. HARDIN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, May 11, 1843.\r\n\r\nFRIEND HARDIN:\r\n\r\nButler informs me that he received a letter from you, in which you\r\nexpressed some doubt whether the Whigs of Sangamon will support you\r\ncordially. You may, at once, dismiss all fears on that subject. We\r\nhave already resolved to make a particular effort to give you the very\r\nlargest majority possible in our county. From this, no Whig of the\r\ncounty dissents. We have many objects for doing it. We make it a matter\r\nof honor and pride to do it; we do it because we love the Whig cause; we\r\ndo it because we like you personally; and last, we wish to convince you\r\nthat we do not bear that hatred to Morgan County that you people have so\r\nlong seemed to imagine. You will see by the journals of this week that\r\nwe propose, upon pain of losing a barbecue, to give you twice as great\r\na majority in this county as you shall receive in your own. I got up the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nWho of the five appointed is to write the district address? I did the\r\nlabor of writing one address this year, and got thunder for my reward.\r\nNothing new here.\r\n\r\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--I wish you would measure one of the largest of those swords we\r\ntook to Alton and write me the length of it, from tip of the point to\r\ntip of the hilt, in feet and inches. I have a dispute about the length.\r\n\r\nA. L. A.

SPEED. SPRINGFIELD, May 18, 1843.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 9th instant is duly received, which I do\r\nnot meet as a \"bore,\" but as a most welcome visitor. I will answer the\r\nbusiness part of it first.\r\n\r\nIn relation to our Congress matter here, you were right in supposing I\r\nwould support the nominee. Neither Baker nor I, however, is the man, but\r\nHardin, so far as I can judge from present appearances. We shall have no\r\nsplit or trouble about the matter; all will be harmony. In relation to\r\nthe \"coming events\" about which Butler wrote you, I had not heard one word\r\nbefore I got your letter; but I have so much confidence in the judgment of\r\nButler on such a subject that I incline to think there may be some reality\r\nin it. What day does Butler appoint? By the way, how do \"events\" of the\r\nsame sort come on in your family? Are you possessing houses and lands, and\r\noxen and asses, and men-servants and maid-servants, and begetting sons\r\nand daughters? We are not keeping house, but boarding at the Globe Tavern,\r\nwhich is very well kept now by a widow lady of the name of Beck. Our room\r\n(the same that Dr. Wallace occupied there) and boarding only costs us four\r\ndollars a week. Ann Todd was married something more than a year since to\r\na fellow by the name of Campbell, and who, Mary says, is pretty much of\r\na \"dunce,\" though he has a little money and property. They live in\r\nBoonville, Missouri, and have not been heard from lately enough for me to\r\nsay anything about her health. I reckon it will scarcely be in our\r\npower to visit Kentucky this year. Besides poverty and the necessity of\r\nattending to business, those \"coming events,\" I suspect, would be somewhat\r\nin the way. I most heartily wish you and your Fanny would not fail to\r\ncome. Just let us know the time, and we will have a room provided for you\r\nat our house, and all be merry together for a while. Be sure to give my\r\nrespects to your mother and family; assure her that if ever I come near\r\nher, I will not fail to call and see her. Mary joins in sending love to\r\nyour Fanny and you.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1844\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Gen. J. J. HARDIN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, May 21, 1844.\r\n\r\nDEAR HARDIN: Knowing that you have correspondents enough, I have forborne\r\nto trouble you heretofore; and I now only do so to get you to set a matter\r\nright which has got wrong with one of our best friends. It is old Uncle\r\nThomas Campbell of Spring Creek--(Berlin P.O.). He has received several\r\ndocuments from you, and he says they are old newspapers and documents,\r\nhaving no sort of interest in them. He is, therefore, getting a strong\r\nimpression that you treat him with disrespect. This, I know, is a mistaken\r\nimpression; and you must correct it. The way, I leave to yourself. Rob't\r\nW. Canfield says he would like to have a document or two from you.\r\n\r\nThe Locos (Democrats) here are in considerable trouble about Van Buren's\r\nletter on Texas, and the Virginia electors. They are growing sick of the\r\nTariff question; and consequently are much confounded at V.B.'s cutting\r\nthem off from the new Texas question. Nearly half the leaders swear they\r\nwon't stand it. Of those are Ford, T. Campbell, Ewing, Calhoun and others.\r\nThey don't exactly say they won't vote for V.B., but they say he will not\r\nbe the candidate, and that they are for Texas anyhow.\r\n\r\nAs ever yours,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1845\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES\r\n\r\nTO Gen. J. J. HARDIN, SPRINGFIELD, Jany. 19, 1845.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL:\r\n\r\nI do not wish to join in your proposal of a new plan for the selection of\r\na Whig candidate for Congress because:\r\n\r\n1st. I am entirely satisfied with the old system under which you and Baker\r\nwere successively nominated and elected to Congress; and because the Whigs\r\nof the district are well acquainted with the system, and, so far as I know\r\nor believe, are well satisfied with it. If the old system be thought to be\r\nvague, as to all the delegates of the county voting the same way, or as\r\nto instructions to them as to whom they are to vote for, or as to filling\r\nvacancies, I am willing to join in a provision to make these matters\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n2d. As to your proposals that a poll shall be opened in every precinct,\r\nand that the whole shall take place on the same day, I do not personally\r\nobject. They seem to me to be not unfair; and I forbear to join in\r\nproposing them only because I choose to leave the decision in each\r\ncounty to the Whigs of the county, to be made as their own judgment and\r\nconvenience may dictate.\r\n\r\n3d. As to your proposed stipulation that all the candidates shall remain\r\nin their own counties, and restrain their friends in the same it seems\r\nto me that on reflection you will see the fact of your having been in\r\nCongress has, in various ways, so spread your name in the district as\r\nto give you a decided advantage in such a stipulation. I appreciate your\r\ndesire to keep down excitement; and I promise you to \"keep cool\" under all\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n4th. I have already said I am satisfied with the old system under which\r\nsuch good men have triumphed and that I desire no departure from its\r\nprinciples. But if there must be a departure from it, I shall insist upon\r\na more accurate and just apportionment of delegates, or representative\r\nvotes, to the constituent body, than exists by the old, and which you\r\npropose to retain in your new plan. If we take the entire population of\r\nthe counties as shown by the late census, we shall see by the old plan,\r\nand by your proposed new plan,\r\n\r\n   Morgan County, with a population 16,541, has but ....... 8 votes\r\n   While Sangamon with 18,697--2156 greater has but ....... 8  \"\r\n   So Scott with 6553 has ................................. 4  \"\r\n   While Tazewell with 7615 1062 greater has but .......... 4  \"\r\n   So Mason with 3135 has ................................. 1 vote\r\n   While Logan with 3907, 772 greater, has but ............ 1  \"\r\n\r\nAnd so on in a less degree the matter runs through all the counties, being\r\nnot only wrong in principle, but the advantage of it being all manifestly\r\nin your favor with one slight exception, in the comparison of two counties\r\nnot here mentioned.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we take the Whig votes of the counties as shown by the late\r\nPresidential election as a basis, the thing is still worse.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me most obvious that the old system needs adjustment in\r\nnothing so much as in this; and still, by your proposal, no notice is\r\ntaken of it. I have always been in the habit of acceding to almost any\r\nproposal that a friend would make and I am truly sorry that I cannot in\r\nthis. I perhaps ought to mention that some friends at different places are\r\nendeavoring to secure the honor of the sitting of the convention at their\r\ntowns respectively, and I fear that they would not feel much complimented\r\nif we shall make a bargain that it should sit nowhere.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ------ WILLIAMS,\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 1, 1845.\r\n\r\nFRIEND WILLIAMS:\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court adjourned this morning for the term. Your cases of\r\nReinhardt vs. Schuyler, Bunce vs. Schuyler, Dickhut vs. Dunell, and\r\nSullivan vs. Andrews are continued. Hinman vs. Pope I wrote you concerning\r\nsome time ago. McNutt et al. vs. Bean and Thompson is reversed and\r\nremanded.\r\n\r\nFitzpatrick vs. Brady et al. is reversed and remanded with leave to\r\ncomplainant to amend his bill so as to show the real consideration given\r\nfor the land.\r\n\r\nBunce against Graves the court confirmed, wherefore, in accordance with\r\nyour directions, I moved to have the case remanded to enable you to take a\r\nnew trial in the court below. The court allowed the motion; of which I am\r\nglad, and I guess you are.\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, is all as to court business. The canal men have got their\r\nmeasure through the Legislature pretty much or quite in the shape they\r\ndesired. Nothing else now.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOLITION MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAMSON DURLEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, October 3, 1845\r\n\r\nWhen I saw you at home, it was agreed that I should write to you and your\r\nbrother Madison. Until I then saw you I was not aware of your being what\r\nis generally called an abolitionist, or, as you call yourself, a Liberty\r\nman, though I well knew there were many such in your country.\r\n\r\nI was glad to hear that you intended to attempt to bring about, at the\r\nnext election in Putnam, a Union of the Whigs proper and such of the\r\nLiberty men as are Whigs in principle on all questions save only that of\r\nslavery. So far as I can perceive, by such union neither party need\r\nyield anything on the point in difference between them. If the Whig\r\nabolitionists of New York had voted with us last fall, Mr. Clay would now\r\nbe President, Whig principles in the ascendant, and Texas not annexed;\r\nwhereas, by the division, all that either had at stake in the contest was\r\nlost. And, indeed, it was extremely probable, beforehand, that such would\r\nbe the result. As I always understood, the Liberty men deprecated the\r\nannexation of Texas extremely; and this being so, why they should refuse\r\nto cast their votes [so] as to prevent it, even to me seemed wonderful.\r\nWhat was their process of reasoning, I can only judge from what a single\r\none of them told me. It was this: \"We are not to do evil that good may\r\ncome.\" This general proposition is doubtless correct; but did it apply?\r\nIf by your votes you could have prevented the extension, etc., of slavery\r\nwould it not have been good, and not evil, so to have used your votes,\r\neven though it involved the casting of them for a slaveholder? By the\r\nfruit the tree is to be known. An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit.\r\nIf the fruit of electing Mr. Clay would have been to prevent the extension\r\nof slavery, could the act of electing have been evil?\r\n\r\nBut I will not argue further. I perhaps ought to say that individually I\r\nnever was much interested in the Texas question. I never could see\r\nmuch good to come of annexation, inasmuch as they were already a free\r\nrepublican people on our own model. On the other hand, I never could\r\nvery clearly see how the annexation would augment the evil of slavery.\r\nIt always seemed to me that slaves would be taken there in about equal\r\nnumbers, with or without annexation. And if more were taken because of\r\nannexation, still there would be just so many the fewer left where\r\nthey were taken from. It is possibly true, to some extent, that, with\r\nannexation, some slaves may be sent to Texas and continued in slavery that\r\notherwise might have been liberated. To whatever extent this may be true,\r\nI think annexation an evil. I hold it to be a paramount duty of us in the\r\nfree States, due to the Union of the States, and perhaps to liberty itself\r\n(paradox though it may seem), to let the slavery of the other States\r\nalone; while, on the other hand, I hold it to be equally clear that we\r\nshould never knowingly lend ourselves, directly or indirectly, to prevent\r\nthat slavery from dying a natural death--to find new places for it to\r\nlive in when it can no longer exist in the old. Of course I am not now\r\nconsidering what would be our duty in cases of insurrection among the\r\nslaves. To recur to the Texas question, I understand the Liberty men to\r\nhave viewed annexation as a much greater evil than ever I did; and I would\r\nlike to convince you, if I could, that they could have prevented it, if\r\nthey had chosen. I intend this letter for you and Madison together; and\r\nif you and he or either shall think fit to drop me a line, I shall be\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nYours with respect,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1846\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR POLITICAL SUPPORT\r\n\r\nTO Dr. ROBERT BOAL. SPRINGFIELD, January 7, 1846.\r\n\r\nDr. ROBERT BOAL, Lacon, Ill.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR:--Since I saw you last fall, I have often thought of writing\r\nto you, as it was then understood I would, but, on reflection, I have\r\nalways found that I had nothing new to tell you. All has happened as I\r\nthen told you I expected it would--Baker's declining, Hardin's taking the\r\ntrack, and so on.\r\n\r\nIf Hardin and I stood precisely equal, if neither of us had been to\r\nCongress, or if we both had, it would only accord with what I have always\r\ndone, for the sake of peace, to give way to him; and I expect I should do\r\nit. That I can voluntarily postpone my pretensions, when they are no more\r\nthan equal to those to which they are postponed, you have yourself seen.\r\nBut to yield to Hardin under present circumstances seems to me as nothing\r\nelse than yielding to one who would gladly sacrifice me altogether. This\r\nI would rather not submit to. That Hardin is talented, energetic, usually\r\ngenerous and magnanimous, I have before this affirmed to you and do not\r\ndeny. You know that my only argument is that \"turn about is fair play.\"\r\nThis he, practically at least, denies.\r\n\r\nIf it would not be taxing you too much, I wish you would write me, telling\r\nthe aspect of things in your country, or rather your district; and also,\r\nsend the names of some of your Whig neighbors, to whom I might, with\r\npropriety, write. Unless I can get some one to do this, Hardin, with his\r\nold franking list, will have the advantage of me. My reliance for a fair\r\nshake (and I want nothing more) in your country is chiefly on you, because\r\nof your position and standing, and because I am acquainted with so few\r\nothers. Let me hear from you soon.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BENNETT.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan. 15, 1846.\r\n\r\nJOHN BENNETT.\r\n\r\nFRIEND JOHN:\r\n\r\nNathan Dresser is here, and speaks as though the contest between Hardin\r\nand me is to be doubtful in Menard County. I know he is candid and this\r\nalarms me some. I asked him to tell me the names of the men that were\r\ngoing strong for Hardin, he said Morris was about as strong as any-now\r\ntell me, is Morris going it openly? You remember you wrote me that he\r\nwould be neutral. Nathan also said that some man, whom he could not\r\nremember, had said lately that Menard County was going to decide the\r\ncontest and that made the contest very doubtful. Do you know who that\r\nwas? Don't fail to write me instantly on receiving this, telling me\r\nall--particularly the names of those who are going strong against me.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO N. J. ROCKWELL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, January 21, 1846.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--You perhaps know that General Hardin and I have a contest for\r\nthe Whig nomination for Congress for this district.\r\n\r\nHe has had a turn and my argument is \"turn about is fair play.\"\r\n\r\nI shall be pleased if this strikes you as a sufficient argument.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES BERDAN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, April 26, 1846.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I thank you for the promptness with which you answered my\r\nletter from Bloomington. I also thank you for the frankness with which you\r\ncomment upon a certain part of my letter; because that comment affords\r\nme an opportunity of trying to express myself better than I did before,\r\nseeing, as I do, that in that part of my letter, you have not understood\r\nme as I intended to be understood.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the \"dissatisfaction\" of men who yet mean to do no wrong,\r\netc., I mean no special application of what I said to the Whigs of Morgan,\r\nor of Morgan & Scott. I only had in my mind the fact that previous to\r\nGeneral Hardin's withdrawal some of his friends and some of mine had\r\nbecome a little warm; and I felt, and meant to say, that for them now to\r\nmeet face to face and converse together was the best way to efface any\r\nremnant of unpleasant feeling, if any such existed.\r\n\r\nI did not suppose that General Hardin's friends were in any greater need\r\nof having their feelings corrected than mine were. Since I saw you at\r\nJacksonville, I have had no more suspicion of the Whigs of Morgan than\r\nof those of any other part of the district. I write this only to try to\r\nremove any impression that I distrust you and the other Whigs of your\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES BERDAN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, May 7, 1866.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--It is a matter of high moral obligation, if not of necessity,\r\nfor me to attend the Coles and Edwards courts. I have some cases in both\r\nof them, in which the parties have my promise, and are depending upon me.\r\nThe court commences in Coles on the second Monday, and in Edgar on the\r\nthird. Your court in Morgan commences on the fourth Monday; and it is my\r\npurpose to be with you then, and make a speech. I mention the Coles and\r\nEdgar courts in order that if I should not reach Jacksonville at the time\r\nnamed you may understand the reason why. I do not, however, think there is\r\nmuch danger of my being detained; as I shall go with a purpose not to be,\r\nand consequently shall engage in no new cases that might delay me.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERSES WRITTEN BY LINCOLN AFTER A VISIT TO HIS OLD HOME IN INDIANA\r\n\r\n(A FRAGMENT).\r\n\r\n[In December, 1847, when Lincoln was stumping for Clay, he crossed into\r\nIndiana and revisited his old home. He writes: \"That part of the country\r\nis within itself as unpoetical as any spot on earth; but still seeing\r\nit and its objects and inhabitants aroused feelings in me which were\r\ncertainly poetry; though whether my expression of these feelings is\r\npoetry, is quite another question.\"]\r\n\r\n   Near twenty years have passed away\r\n   Since here I bid farewell\r\n   To woods and fields, and scenes of play,\r\n   And playmates loved so well.\r\n\r\n   Where many were, but few remain\r\n   Of old familiar things;\r\n   But seeing them to mind again\r\n   The lost and absent brings.\r\n\r\n   The friends I left that parting day,\r\n   How changed, as time has sped!\r\n   Young childhood grown, strong manhood gray,\r\n   And half of all are dead.\r\n\r\n   I hear the loved survivors tell\r\n   How naught from death could save,\r\n   Till every sound appears a knell,\r\n   And every spot a grave.\r\n\r\n   I range the fields with pensive tread,\r\n   And pace the hollow rooms,\r\n   And feel (companion of the dead)\r\n   I 'm living in the tombs.\r\n\r\n   VERSES WRITTEN BY LINCOLN CONCERNING A SCHOOL-FELLOW\r\n   WHO BECAME INSANE--(A FRAGMENT).\r\n\r\n   And when at length the drear and long\r\n   Time soothed thy fiercer woes,\r\n   How plaintively thy mournful song\r\n   Upon the still night rose\r\n\r\n   I've heard it oft as if I dreamed,\r\n   Far distant, sweet and lone;\r\n   The funeral dirge it ever seemed\r\n   Of reason dead and gone.\r\n\r\n   Air held her breath; trees with the spell\r\n   Seemed sorrowing angels round,\r\n   Whose swelling tears in dewdrops fell\r\n   Upon the listening ground.\r\n\r\n   But this is past, and naught remains\r\n   That raised thee o'er the brute;\r\n   Thy piercing shrieks and soothing strains\r\n   Are like, forever mute.\r\n\r\n   Now fare thee well! More thou the cause\r\n   Than subject now of woe.\r\n   All mental pangs by time's kind laws\r\n   Hast lost the power to know.\r\n\r\n   O Death! thou awe-inspiring prince\r\n   That keepst the world in fear,\r\n   Why dost thou tear more blest ones hence,\r\n   And leave him lingering here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND CHILD\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA P. SPEED\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, October 22, 1846.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--You, no doubt, assign the suspension of our correspondence to\r\nthe true philosophic cause; though it must be confessed by both of us that\r\nthis is rather a cold reason for allowing a friendship such as ours to\r\ndie out by degrees. I propose now that, upon receipt of this, you shall be\r\nconsidered in my debt, and under obligations to pay soon, and that neither\r\nshall remain long in arrears hereafter. Are you agreed?\r\n\r\nBeing elected to Congress, though I am very grateful to our friends for\r\nhaving done it, has not pleased me as much as I expected.\r\n\r\nWe have another boy, born the 10th of March. He is very much such a child\r\nas Bob was at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is \"short and low,\"\r\nand I expect always will be. He talks very plainly,--almost as plainly as\r\nanybody. He is quite smart enough. I sometimes fear that he is one of the\r\nlittle rare-ripe sort that are smarter at about five than ever after. He\r\nhas a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the offspring of such\r\nanimal spirits. Since I began this letter, a messenger came to tell me Bob\r\nwas lost; but by the time I reached the house his mother had found him and\r\nhad him whipped, and by now, very likely, he is run away again. Mary has\r\nread your letter, and wishes to be remembered to Mrs. Speed and you, in\r\nwhich I most sincerely join her.\r\n\r\nAs ever yours,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MORRIS AND BROWN\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, October 21, 1847.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. MORRIS AND BROWN.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your second letter on the matter of Thornton and others, came\r\nto hand this morning. I went at once to see Logan, and found that he\r\nis not engaged against you, and that he has so sent you word by Mr.\r\nButterfield, as he says. He says that some time ago, a young man (who he\r\nknows not) came to him, with a copy of the affidavit, to engage him to aid\r\nin getting the Governor to grant the warrant; and that he, Logan, told\r\nthe man, that in his opinion, the affidavit was clearly insufficient, upon\r\nwhich the young man left, without making any engagement with him. If the\r\nGovernor shall arrive before I leave, Logan and I will both attend to the\r\nmatter, and he will attend to it, if he does not come till after I leave;\r\nall upon the condition that the Governor shall not have acted upon the\r\nmatter, before his arrival here. I mention this condition because, I\r\nlearned this morning from the Secretary of State, that he is forwarding to\r\nthe Governor, at Palestine, all papers he receives in the case, as fast\r\nas he receives them. Among the papers forwarded will be your letter to\r\nthe Governor or Secretary of, I believe, the same date and about the same\r\ncontents of your last letter to me; so that the Governor will, at all\r\nevents have your points and authorities. The case is a clear one on our\r\nside; but whether the Governor will view it so is another thing.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 5, 1847.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--You may remember that about a year ago a man by the name of\r\nWilson (James Wilson, I think) paid us twenty dollars as an advance fee to\r\nattend to a case in the Supreme Court for him, against a Mr. Campbell, the\r\nrecord of which case was in the hands of Mr. Dixon of St. Louis, who never\r\nfurnished it to us. When I was at Bloomington last fall I met a friend\r\nof Wilson, who mentioned the subject to me, and induced me to write to\r\nWilson, telling him I would leave the ten dollars with you which had been\r\nleft with me to pay for making abstracts in the case, so that the case may\r\ngo on this winter; but I came away, and forgot to do it. What I want now\r\nis to send you the money, to be used accordingly, if any one comes on to\r\nstart the case, or to be retained by you if no one does.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of consequence new here. Congress is to organize\r\nto-morrow. Last night we held a Whig caucus for the House, and nominated\r\nWinthrop of Massachusetts for speaker, Sargent of Pennsylvania for\r\nsergeant-at-arms, Homer of New Jersey door-keeper, and McCormick of\r\nDistrict of Columbia postmaster. The Whig majority in the House is so\r\nsmall that, together with some little dissatisfaction, [it] leaves it\r\ndoubtful whether we will elect them all.\r\n\r\nThis paper is too thick to fold, which is the reason I send only a\r\nhalf-sheet.\r\n\r\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 13, 1847\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Your letter, advising me of the receipt of our fee in the\r\nbank case, is just received, and I don't expect to hear another as good a\r\npiece of news from Springfield while I am away. I am under no obligations\r\nto the bank; and I therefore wish you to buy bank certificates, and pay my\r\ndebt there, so as to pay it with the least money possible. I would as soon\r\nyou should buy them of Mr. Ridgely, or any other person at the bank, as of\r\nany one else, provided you can get them as cheaply. I suppose, after the\r\nbank debt shall be paid, there will be some money left, out of which I\r\nwould like to have you pay Lavely and Stout twenty dollars, and Priest and\r\nsomebody (oil-makers) ten dollars, for materials got for house-painting.\r\nIf there shall still be any left, keep it till you see or hear from me.\r\n\r\nI shall begin sending documents so soon as I can get them. I wrote you\r\nyesterday about a \"Congressional Globe.\" As you are all so anxious for me\r\nto distinguish myself, I have concluded to do so before long.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 22, 1847\r\n\r\nWhereas, The President of the United States, in his message of May 11,\r\n1846, has declared that \"the Mexican Government not only refused to\r\nreceive him [the envoy of the United States], or to listen to his\r\npropositions, but, after a long-continued series of menaces, has at last\r\ninvaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own\r\nsoil\";\r\n\r\nAnd again, in his message of December 8, 1846, that \"we had ample cause of\r\nwar against Mexico long before the breaking out of hostilities; but even\r\nthen we forbore to take redress into our own hands until Mexico herself\r\nbecame the aggressor, by invading our soil in hostile array, and shedding\r\nthe blood of our citizens\";\r\n\r\nAnd yet again, in his message of December 7, 1847, that \"the Mexican\r\nGovernment refused even to hear the terms of adjustment which he [our\r\nminister of peace] was authorized to propose, and finally, under wholly\r\nunjustifiable pretexts, involved the two countries in war, by invading the\r\nterritory of the State of Texas, striking the first blow, and shedding the\r\nblood of our citizens on our own soil\";\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, This House is desirous to obtain a full knowledge of all the\r\nfacts which go to establish whether the particular spot on which the blood\r\nof our citizens was so shed was or was not at that time our own soil:\r\ntherefore,\r\n\r\nResolved, By the House of Representatives, that the President of the\r\nUnited States be respectfully requested to inform this House:\r\n\r\nFirst. Whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens was shed, as\r\nin his message declared, was or was not within the territory of Spain, at\r\nleast after the treaty of 1819, until the Mexican revolution.\r\n\r\nSecond. Whether that spot is or is not within the territory which was\r\nwrested from Spain by the revolutionary government of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThird. Whether that spot is or is not within a settlement of people, which\r\nsettlement has existed ever since long before the Texas revolution, and\r\nuntil its inhabitants fled before the approach of the United States army.\r\n\r\nFourth. Whether that settlement is or is not isolated from any and all\r\nother settlements by the Gulf and the Rio Grande on the south and west,\r\nand by wide uninhabited regions on the north and east.\r\n\r\nFifth. Whether the people of that settlement, or a majority of them, or\r\nany of them, have ever submitted themselves to the government or laws\r\nof Texas or of the United States, by consent or by compulsion, either by\r\naccepting office, or voting at elections, or paying tax, or serving on\r\njuries, or having process served upon them, or in any other way.\r\n\r\nSixth. Whether the people of that settlement did or did not flee from the\r\napproach of the United States army, leaving unprotected their homes and\r\ntheir growing crops, before the blood was shed, as in the message stated;\r\nand whether the first blood, so shed, was or was not shed within the\r\ninclosure of one of the people who had thus fled from it.\r\n\r\nSeventh. Whether our citizens, whose blood was shed, as in his message\r\ndeclared, were or were not, at that time, armed officers and soldiers,\r\nsent into that settlement by the military order of the President, through\r\nthe Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nEighth. Whether the military force of the United States was or was not\r\nso sent into that settlement after General Taylor had more than once\r\nintimated to the War Department that, in his opinion, no such movement was\r\nnecessary to the defence or protection of Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nJANUARY 5, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said he had made an effort, some few days since, to obtain the\r\nfloor in relation to this measure [resolution to direct Postmaster-General\r\nto make arrangements with railroad for carrying the mails--in Committee of\r\nthe Whole], but had failed. One of the objects he had then had in view was\r\nnow in a great measure superseded by what had fallen from the gentleman\r\nfrom Virginia who had just taken his seat. He begged to assure his friends\r\non the other side of the House that no assault whatever was meant upon the\r\nPostmaster-General, and he was glad that what the gentleman had now said\r\nmodified to a great extent the impression which might have been created\r\nby the language he had used on a previous occasion. He wanted to state to\r\ngentlemen who might have entertained such impressions, that the Committee\r\non the Post-office was composed of five Whigs and four Democrats, and\r\ntheir report was understood as sustaining, not impugning, the position\r\ntaken by the Postmaster-General. That report had met with the approbation\r\nof all the Whigs, and of all the Democrats also, with the exception\r\nof one, and he wanted to go even further than this. [Intimation was\r\ninformally given Mr. Lincoln that it was not in order to mention on the\r\nfloor what had taken place in committee.] He then observed that if he had\r\nbeen out of order in what he had said he took it all back so far as he\r\ncould. He had no desire, he could assure gentlemen, ever to be out of\r\norder--though he never could keep long in order.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln went on to observe that he differed in opinion, in the present\r\ncase, from his honorable friend from Richmond [Mr. Botts]. That gentleman,\r\nhad begun his remarks by saying that if all prepossessions in this\r\nmatter could be removed out of the way, but little difficulty would be\r\nexperienced in coming to an agreement. Now, he could assure that\r\ngentleman that he had himself begun the examination of the subject with\r\nprepossessions all in his favor. He had long and often heard of him,\r\nand, from what he had heard, was prepossessed in his favor. Of the\r\nPostmaster-General he had also heard, but had no prepossessions in his\r\nfavor, though certainly none of an opposite kind. He differed, however,\r\nwith that gentleman in politics, while in this respect he agreed with the\r\ngentleman from Virginia [Mr. Botts], whom he wished to oblige whenever it\r\nwas in his power. That gentleman had referred to the report made to the\r\nHouse by the Postmaster-General, and had intimated an apprehension that\r\ngentlemen would be disposed to rely, on that report alone, and derive\r\ntheir views of the case from that document alone. Now it so happened that\r\na pamphlet had been slipped into his [Mr. Lincoln's] hand before he read\r\nthe report of the Postmaster-General; so that, even in this, he had begun\r\nwith prepossessions in favor of the gentleman from Virginia.\r\n\r\nAs to the report, he had but one remark to make: he had carefully examined\r\nit, and he did not understand that there was any dispute as to the facts\r\ntherein stated the dispute, if he understood it, was confined altogether\r\nto the inferences to be drawn from those facts. It was a difference not\r\nabout facts, but about conclusions. The facts were not disputed. If he was\r\nright in this, he supposed the House might assume the facts to be as they\r\nwere stated, and thence proceed to draw their own conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman had said that the Postmaster-General had got into a personal\r\nsquabble with the railroad company. Of this Mr. Lincoln knew nothing, nor\r\ndid he need or desire to know anything, because it had nothing whatever to\r\ndo with a just conclusion from the premises. But the gentleman had gone\r\non to ask whether so great a grievance as the present detention of the\r\nSouthern mail ought not to be remedied. Mr. Lincoln would assure the\r\ngentleman that if there was a proper way of doing it, no man was more\r\nanxious than he that it should be done. The report made by the committee\r\nhad been intended to yield much for the sake of removing that grievance.\r\nThat the grievance was very great there was no dispute in any quarter. He\r\nsupposed that the statements made by the gentleman from Virginia to show\r\nthis were all entirely correct in point of fact. He did suppose that the\r\ninterruptions of regular intercourse, and all the other inconveniences\r\ngrowing out of it, were all as that gentleman had stated them to be;\r\nand certainly, if redress could be rendered, it was proper it should be\r\nrendered as soon as possible. The gentleman said that in order to effect\r\nthis no new legislative action was needed; all that was necessary was that\r\nthe Postmaster-General should be required to do what the law, as it stood,\r\nauthorized and required him to do.\r\n\r\nWe come then, said Mr. Lincoln, to the law. Now the Postmaster-General\r\nsays he cannot give to this company more than two hundred and thirty-seven\r\ndollars and fifty cents per railroad mile of transportation, and twelve\r\nand a half per cent. less for transportation by steamboats. He considers\r\nhimself as restricted by law to this amount; and he says, further, that he\r\nwould not give more if he could, because in his apprehension it would not\r\nbe fair and just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1848\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESIRE FOR SECOND TERM IN CONGRESS\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 8, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Your letter of December 27 was received a day or two ago. I\r\nam much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken, and promise to take\r\nin my little business there. As to speech making, by way of getting\r\nthe hang of the House I made a little speech two or three days ago on\r\na post-office question of no general interest. I find speaking here and\r\nelsewhere about the same thing. I was about as badly scared, and no worse\r\nas I am when I speak in court. I expect to make one within a week or two,\r\nin which I hope to succeed well enough to wish you to see it.\r\n\r\nIt is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some who desire\r\nthat I should be reelected. I most heartily thank them for their kind\r\npartiality; and I can say, as Mr. Clay said of the annexation of Texas,\r\nthat \"personally I would not object\" to a reelection, although I thought\r\nat the time, and still think, it would be quite as well for me to return\r\nto the law at the end of a single term. I made the declaration that I\r\nwould not be a candidate again, more from a wish to deal fairly with\r\nothers, to keep peace among our friends, and to keep the district from\r\ngoing to the enemy, than for any cause personal to myself; so that if it\r\nshould so happen that nobody else wishes to be elected, I could not\r\nrefuse the people the right of sending me again. But to enter myself as\r\na competitor of others, or to authorize any one so to enter me is what my\r\nword and honor forbid.\r\n\r\nI got some letters intimating a probability of so much difficulty amongst\r\nour friends as to lose us the district; but I remember such letters were\r\nwritten to Baker when my own case was under consideration, and I trust\r\nthere is no more ground for such apprehension now than there was then.\r\nRemember I am always glad to receive a letter from you.\r\n\r\nMost truly your friend,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON DECLARATION OF WAR ON MEXICO\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nJANUARY 12, 1848.\r\n\r\nMR CHAIRMAN:--Some if not all the gentlemen on the other side of the House\r\nwho have addressed the committee within the last two days have spoken\r\nrather complainingly, if I have rightly understood them, of the vote\r\ngiven a week or ten days ago declaring that the war with Mexico was\r\nunnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President. I admit\r\nthat such a vote should not be given in mere party wantonness, and\r\nthat the one given is justly censurable if it have no other or better\r\nfoundation. I am one of those who joined in that vote; and I did so under\r\nmy best impression of the truth of the case. How I got this impression,\r\nand how it may possibly be remedied, I will now try to show. When the war\r\nbegan, it was my opinion that all those who because of knowing too little,\r\nor because of knowing too much, could not conscientiously approve the\r\nconduct of the President in the beginning of it should nevertheless, as\r\ngood citizens and patriots, remain silent on that point, at least till the\r\nwar should be ended. Some leading Democrats, including ex-President Van\r\nBuren, have taken this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered\r\nto it and acted upon it, until since I took my seat here; and I think I\r\nshould still adhere to it were it not that the President and his friends\r\nwill not allow it to be so. Besides the continual effort of the President\r\nto argue every silent vote given for supplies into an indorsement of\r\nthe justice and wisdom of his conduct; besides that singularly candid\r\nparagraph in his late message in which he tells us that Congress with\r\ngreat unanimity had declared that \"by the act of the Republic of Mexico,\r\na state of war exists between that government and the United States,\" when\r\nthe same journals that informed him of this also informed him that\r\nwhen that declaration stood disconnected from the question of supplies\r\nsixty-seven in the House, and not fourteen merely, voted against it;\r\nbesides this open attempt to prove by telling the truth what he could not\r\nprove by telling the whole truth-demanding of all who will not submit to\r\nbe misrepresented, in justice to themselves, to speak out, besides all\r\nthis, one of my colleagues [Mr. Richardson] at a very early day in the\r\nsession brought in a set of resolutions expressly indorsing the original\r\njustice of the war on the part of the President. Upon these resolutions\r\nwhen they shall be put on their passage I shall be compelled to vote; so\r\nthat I cannot be silent if I would. Seeing this, I went about preparing\r\nmyself to give the vote understandingly when it should come. I carefully\r\nexamined the President's message, to ascertain what he himself had said\r\nand proved upon the point. The result of this examination was to make the\r\nimpression that, taking for true all the President states as facts, he\r\nfalls far short of proving his justification; and that the President would\r\nhave gone further with his proof if it had not been for the small matter\r\nthat the truth would not permit him. Under the impression thus made I gave\r\nthe vote before mentioned. I propose now to give concisely the process\r\nof the examination I made, and how I reached the conclusion I did. The\r\nPresident, in his first war message of May, 1846, declares that the soil\r\nwas ours on which hostilities were commenced by Mexico, and he repeats\r\nthat declaration almost in the same language in each successive annual\r\nmessage, thus showing that he deems that point a highly essential one. In\r\nthe importance of that point I entirely agree with the President. To\r\nmy judgment it is the very point upon which he should be justified, or\r\ncondemned. In his message of December, 1846, it seems to have occurred to\r\nhim, as is certainly true, that title-ownership-to soil or anything else\r\nis not a simple fact, but is a conclusion following on one or more simple\r\nfacts; and that it was incumbent upon him to present the facts from which\r\nhe concluded the soil was ours on which the first blood of the war was\r\nshed.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a little below the middle of page twelve in the message last\r\nreferred to, he enters upon that task; forming an issue and introducing\r\ntestimony, extending the whole to a little below the middle of page\r\nfourteen. Now, I propose to try to show that the whole of this--issue and\r\nevidence--is from beginning to end the sheerest deception. The issue, as\r\nhe presents it, is in these words: \"But there are those who, conceding all\r\nthis to be true, assume the ground that the true western boundary of Texas\r\nis the Nueces, instead of the Rio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching\r\nour army to the east bank of the latter river, we passed the Texas line\r\nand invaded the territory of Mexico.\" Now this issue is made up of two\r\naffirmatives and no negative. The main deception of it is that it assumes\r\nas true that one river or the other is necessarily the boundary; and\r\ncheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the idea that possibly\r\nthe boundary is somewhere between the two, and not actually at either. A\r\nfurther deception is that it will let in evidence which a true issue would\r\nexclude. A true issue made by the President would be about as follows: \"I\r\nsay the soil was ours, on which the first blood was shed; there are those\r\nwho say it was not.\"\r\n\r\nI now proceed to examine the President's evidence as applicable to such an\r\nissue. When that evidence is analyzed, it is all included in the following\r\npropositions:\r\n\r\n(1) That the Rio Grande was the western boundary of Louisiana as we\r\npurchased it of France in 1803.\r\n\r\n(2) That the Republic of Texas always claimed the Rio Grande as her\r\neastern boundary.\r\n\r\n(3) That by various acts she had claimed it on paper.\r\n\r\n(4) That Santa Anna in his treaty with Texas recognized the Rio Grande as\r\nher boundary.\r\n\r\n(5) That Texas before, and the United States after, annexation had\r\nexercised jurisdiction beyond the Nueces--between the two rivers.\r\n\r\n(6) That our Congress understood the boundary of Texas to extend beyond\r\nthe Nueces.\r\n\r\nNow for each of these in its turn. His first item is that the Rio Grande\r\nwas the western boundary of Louisiana, as we purchased it of France in\r\n1803; and seeming to expect this to be disputed, he argues over the amount\r\nof nearly a page to prove it true, at the end of which he lets us know\r\nthat by the treaty of 1803 we sold to Spain the whole country from the Rio\r\nGrande eastward to the Sabine. Now, admitting for the present that the\r\nRio Grande was the boundary of Louisiana, what under heaven had that to\r\ndo with the present boundary between us and Mexico? How, Mr. Chairman,\r\nthe line that once divided your land from mine can still be the\r\nboundary between us after I have sold my land to you is to me beyond all\r\ncomprehension. And how any man, with an honest purpose only of proving the\r\ntruth, could ever have thought of introducing such a fact to prove such an\r\nissue is equally incomprehensible. His next piece of evidence is that \"the\r\nRepublic of Texas always claimed this river [Rio Grande] as her western\r\nboundary.\" That is not true, in fact. Texas has claimed it, but she has\r\nnot always claimed it. There is at least one distinguished exception. Her\r\nState constitution the republic's most solemn and well-considered\r\nact, that which may, without impropriety, be called her last will and\r\ntestament, revoking all others-makes no such claim. But suppose she had\r\nalways claimed it. Has not Mexico always claimed the contrary? So that\r\nthere is but claim against claim, leaving nothing proved until we get back\r\nof the claims and find which has the better foundation. Though not in the\r\norder in which the President presents his evidence, I now consider that\r\nclass of his statements which are in substance nothing more than that\r\nTexas has, by various acts of her Convention and Congress, claimed the\r\nRio Grande as her boundary, on paper. I mean here what he says about the\r\nfixing of the Rio Grande as her boundary in her old constitution (not her\r\nState constitution), about forming Congressional districts, counties, etc.\r\nNow all of this is but naked claim; and what I have already said about\r\nclaims is strictly applicable to this. If I should claim your land by word\r\nof mouth, that certainly would not make it mine; and if I were to claim it\r\nby a deed which I had made myself, and with which you had had nothing to\r\ndo, the claim would be quite the same in substance--or rather, in utter\r\nnothingness. I next consider the President's statement that Santa Anna in\r\nhis treaty with Texas recognized the Rio Grande as the western boundary\r\nof Texas. Besides the position so often taken, that Santa Anna while a\r\nprisoner of war, a captive, could not bind Mexico by a treaty, which I\r\ndeem conclusive--besides this, I wish to say something in relation to this\r\ntreaty, so called by the President, with Santa Anna. If any man would like\r\nto be amused by a sight of that little thing which the President calls by\r\nthat big name, he can have it by turning to Niles's Register, vol. 1,\r\np. 336. And if any one should suppose that Niles's Register is a curious\r\nrepository of so mighty a document as a solemn treaty between nations, I\r\ncan only say that I learned to a tolerable degree of certainty, by inquiry\r\nat the State Department, that the President himself never saw it anywhere\r\nelse. By the way, I believe I should not err if I were to declare that\r\nduring the first ten years of the existence of that document it was\r\nnever by anybody called a treaty--that it was never so called till the\r\nPresident, in his extremity, attempted by so calling it to wring something\r\nfrom it in justification of himself in connection with the Mexican War.\r\nIt has none of the distinguishing features of a treaty. It does not call\r\nitself a treaty. Santa Anna does not therein assume to bind Mexico; he\r\nassumes only to act as the President--Commander-in-Chief of the Mexican\r\narmy and navy; stipulates that the then present hostilities should cease,\r\nand that he would not himself take up arms, nor influence the Mexican\r\npeople to take up arms, against Texas during the existence of the war of\r\nindependence. He did not recognize the independence of Texas; he did not\r\nassume to put an end to the war, but clearly indicated his expectation\r\nof its continuance; he did not say one word about boundary, and, most\r\nprobably, never thought of it. It is stipulated therein that the Mexican\r\nforces should evacuate the territory of Texas, passing to the other\r\nside of the Rio Grande; and in another article it is stipulated that, to\r\nprevent collisions between the armies, the Texas army should not approach\r\nnearer than within five leagues--of what is not said, but clearly, from\r\nthe object stated, it is of the Rio Grande. Now, if this is a treaty\r\nrecognizing the Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas, it contains the\r\nsingular feature of stipulating that Texas shall not go within five\r\nleagues of her own boundary.\r\n\r\nNext comes the evidence of Texas before annexation, and the United States\r\nafterwards, exercising jurisdiction beyond the Nueces and between the two\r\nrivers. This actual exercise of jurisdiction is the very class or quality\r\nof evidence we want. It is excellent so far as it goes; but does it go far\r\nenough? He tells us it went beyond the Nueces, but he does not tell us it\r\nwent to the Rio Grande. He tells us jurisdiction was exercised between\r\nthe two rivers, but he does not tell us it was exercised over all the\r\nterritory between them. Some simple-minded people think it is possible to\r\ncross one river and go beyond it without going all the way to the next,\r\nthat jurisdiction may be exercised between two rivers without covering\r\nall the country between them. I know a man, not very unlike myself, who\r\nexercises jurisdiction over a piece of land between the Wabash and the\r\nMississippi; and yet so far is this from being all there is between those\r\nrivers that it is just one hundred and fifty-two feet long by fifty feet\r\nwide, and no part of it much within a hundred miles of either. He has a\r\nneighbor between him and the Mississippi--that is, just across the street,\r\nin that direction--whom I am sure he could neither persuade nor force to\r\ngive up his habitation; but which nevertheless he could certainly annex,\r\nif it were to be done by merely standing on his own side of the street and\r\nclaiming it, or even sitting down and writing a deed for it.\r\n\r\nBut next the President tells us the Congress of the United States\r\nunderstood the State of Texas they admitted into the Union to extend\r\nbeyond the Nueces. Well, I suppose they did. I certainly so understood it.\r\nBut how far beyond? That Congress did not understand it to extend clear\r\nto the Rio Grande is quite certain, by the fact of their joint resolutions\r\nfor admission expressly leaving all questions of boundary to future\r\nadjustment. And it may be added that Texas herself is proven to have had\r\nthe same understanding of it that our Congress had, by the fact of the\r\nexact conformity of her new constitution to those resolutions.\r\n\r\nI am now through the whole of the President's evidence; and it is a\r\nsingular fact that if any one should declare the President sent the army\r\ninto the midst of a settlement of Mexican people who had never submitted,\r\nby consent or by force, to the authority of Texas or of the United States,\r\nand that there and thereby the first blood of the war was shed, there is\r\nnot one word in all the which would either admit or deny the declaration.\r\nThis strange omission it does seem to me could not have occurred but by\r\ndesign. My way of living leads me to be about the courts of justice; and\r\nthere I have sometimes seen a good lawyer, struggling for his client's\r\nneck in a desperate case, employing every artifice to work round, befog,\r\nand cover up with many words some point arising in the case which he dared\r\nnot admit and yet could not deny. Party bias may help to make it appear\r\nso, but with all the allowance I can make for such bias, it still\r\ndoes appear to me that just such, and from just such necessity, is the\r\nPresident's struggle in this case.\r\n\r\nSometime after my colleague [Mr. Richardson] introduced the resolutions I\r\nhave mentioned, I introduced a preamble, resolution, and interrogations,\r\nintended to draw the President out, if possible, on this hitherto\r\nuntrodden ground. To show their relevancy, I propose to state my\r\nunderstanding of the true rule for ascertaining the boundary between Texas\r\nand Mexico. It is that wherever Texas was exercising jurisdiction was\r\nhers; and wherever Mexico was exercising jurisdiction was hers; and that\r\nwhatever separated the actual exercise of jurisdiction of the one from\r\nthat of the other was the true boundary between them. If, as is probably\r\ntrue, Texas was exercising jurisdiction along the western bank of the\r\nNueces, and Mexico was exercising it along the eastern bank of the Rio\r\nGrande, then neither river was the boundary: but the uninhabited country\r\nbetween the two was. The extent of our territory in that region depended\r\nnot on any treaty-fixed boundary (for no treaty had attempted it), but on\r\nrevolution. Any people anywhere being inclined and having the power have\r\nthe right to rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a\r\nnew one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred\r\nright--a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world. Nor\r\nis this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing\r\ngovernment may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that can\r\nmay revolutionize and make their own of so much of the territory as they\r\ninhabit. More than this, a majority of any portion of such people may\r\nrevolutionize, putting down a minority, intermingled with or near about\r\nthem, who may oppose this movement. Such minority was precisely the case\r\nof the Tories of our own revolution. It is a quality of revolutions not to\r\ngo by old lines or old laws, but to break up both, and make new ones.\r\n\r\nAs to the country now in question, we bought it of France in 1803, and\r\nsold it to Spain in 1819, according to the President's statements. After\r\nthis, all Mexico, including Texas, revolutionized against Spain; and still\r\nlater Texas revolutionized against Mexico. In my view, just so far as\r\nshe carried her resolution by obtaining the actual, willing or unwilling,\r\nsubmission of the people, so far the country was hers, and no farther.\r\nNow, sir, for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence as to\r\nwhether Texas had actually carried her revolution to the place where the\r\nhostilities of the present war commenced, let the President answer the\r\ninterrogatories I proposed, as before mentioned, or some other similar\r\nones. Let him answer fully, fairly, and candidly. Let him answer with\r\nfacts and not with arguments. Let him remember he sits where Washington\r\nsat, and so remembering, let him answer as Washington would answer. As\r\na nation should not, and the Almighty will not, be evaded, so let him\r\nattempt no evasion--no equivocation. And if, so answering, he can show\r\nthat the soil was ours where the first blood of the war was shed,--that\r\nit was not within an inhabited country, or, if within such, that the\r\ninhabitants had submitted themselves to the civil authority of Texas or\r\nof the United States, and that the same is true of the site of Fort Brown,\r\nthen I am with him for his justification. In that case I shall be most\r\nhappy to reverse the vote I gave the other day. I have a selfish motive\r\nfor desiring that the President may do this--I expect to gain some votes,\r\nin connection with the war, which, without his so doing, will be of\r\ndoubtful propriety in my own judgment, but which will be free from the\r\ndoubt if he does so. But if he can not or will not do this,--if on any\r\npretence or no pretence he shall refuse or omit it then I shall be fully\r\nconvinced of what I more than suspect already that he is deeply conscious\r\nof being in the wrong; that he feels the blood of this war, like the blood\r\nof Abel, is crying to heaven against him; that originally having some\r\nstrong motive--what, I will not stop now to give my opinion concerning\r\nto involve the two countries in a war, and trusting to escape scrutiny\r\nby fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military\r\nglory,--that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood, that\r\nserpent's eye that charms to destroy,--he plunged into it, and was swept\r\non and on till, disappointed in his calculation of the ease with which\r\nMexico might be subdued, he now finds himself he knows not where. How like\r\nthe half insane mumbling of a fever dream is the whole war part of his\r\nlate message! At one time telling us that Mexico has nothing whatever that\r\nwe can get--but territory; at another showing us how we can support the\r\nwar by levying contributions on Mexico. At one time urging the national\r\nhonor, the security of the future, the prevention of foreign interference,\r\nand even the good of Mexico herself as among the objects of the war; at\r\nanother telling us that \"to reject indemnity, by refusing to accept a\r\ncession of territory, would be to abandon all our just demands, and to\r\nwage the war, bearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite\r\nobject.\" So then this national honor, security of the future, and\r\neverything but territorial indemnity may be considered the no-purposes and\r\nindefinite objects of the war! But, having it now settled that territorial\r\nindemnity is the only object, we are urged to seize, by legislation here,\r\nall that he was content to take a few months ago, and the whole province\r\nof Lower California to boot, and to still carry on the war to take all\r\nwe are fighting for, and still fight on. Again, the President is resolved\r\nunder all circumstances to have full territorial indemnity for the\r\nexpenses of the war; but he forgets to tell us how we are to get the\r\nexcess after those expenses shall have surpassed the value of the whole\r\nof the Mexican territory. So again, he insists that the separate national\r\nexistence of Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not tell us how\r\nthis can be done, after we shall have taken all her territory. Lest the\r\nquestions I have suggested be considered speculative merely, let me be\r\nindulged a moment in trying to show they are not. The war has gone on some\r\ntwenty months; for the expenses of which, together with an inconsiderable\r\nold score, the President now claims about one half of the Mexican\r\nterritory, and that by far the better half, so far as concerns our ability\r\nto make anything out of it. It is comparatively uninhabited; so that we\r\ncould establish land-offices in it, and raise some money in that way. But\r\nthe other half is already inhabited, as I understand it, tolerably\r\ndensely for the nature of the country, and all its lands, or all that are\r\nvaluable, already appropriated as private property. How then are we to\r\nmake anything out of these lands with this encumbrance on them? or how\r\nremove the encumbrance? I suppose no one would say we should kill the\r\npeople, or drive them out, or make slaves of them, or confiscate their\r\nproperty. How, then, can we make much out of this part of the territory?\r\nIf the prosecution of the war has in expenses already equalled the better\r\nhalf of the country, how long its future prosecution will be in equalling\r\nthe less valuable half is not a speculative, but a practical, question,\r\npressing closely upon us. And yet it is a question which the President\r\nseems never to have thought of. As to the mode of terminating the war and\r\nsecuring peace, the President is equally wandering and indefinite. First,\r\nit is to be done by a more vigorous prosecution of the war in the vital\r\nparts of the enemy's country; and after apparently talking himself tired\r\non this point, the President drops down into a half-despairing tone,\r\nand tells us that \"with a people distracted and divided by contending\r\nfactions, and a government subject to constant changes by successive\r\nrevolutions, the continued success of our arms may fail to secure a\r\nsatisfactory peace.\" Then he suggests the propriety of wheedling the\r\nMexican people to desert the counsels of their own leaders, and, trusting\r\nin our protestations, to set up a government from which we can secure\r\na satisfactory peace; telling us that \"this may become the only mode of\r\nobtaining such a peace.\" But soon he falls into doubt of this too; and\r\nthen drops back on to the already half-abandoned ground of \"more vigorous\r\nprosecution.\" All this shows that the President is in nowise satisfied\r\nwith his own positions. First he takes up one, and in attempting to argue\r\nus into it he argues himself out of it, then seizes another and goes\r\nthrough the same process, and then, confused at being able to think of\r\nnothing new, he snatches up the old one again, which he has some time\r\nbefore cast off. His mind, taxed beyond its power, is running hither and\r\nthither, like some tortured creature on a burning surface, finding no\r\nposition on which it can settle down and be at ease.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is a singular omission in this message that it nowhere intimates\r\nwhen the President expects the war to terminate. At its beginning, General\r\nScott was by this same President driven into disfavor if not disgrace, for\r\nintimating that peace could not be conquered in less than three or four\r\nmonths. But now, at the end of about twenty months, during which time our\r\narms have given us the most splendid successes, every department and every\r\npart, land and water, officers and privates, regulars and volunteers,\r\ndoing all that men could do, and hundreds of things which it had ever\r\nbefore been thought men could not do--after all this, this same President\r\ngives a long message, without showing us that as to the end he himself has\r\neven an imaginary conception. As I have before said, he knows not where he\r\nis. He is a bewildered, confounded, and miserably perplexed man. God grant\r\nhe may be able to show there is not something about his conscience more\r\npainful than his mental perplexity.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the so-called \"treaty\" referred to in the\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Articles of Agreement entered into between his Excellency\r\nDavid G. Burnet, President of the Republic of Texas, of the one part,\r\nand his Excellency General Santa Anna, President-General-in-Chief of the\r\nMexican army, of the other part:\r\n\r\n   \"Article I. General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna agrees that\r\nhe will not take up arms, nor will he exercise his influence to cause\r\nthem to be taken up, against the people of Texas during the present war of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n   \"Article II. All hostilities between the Mexican and Texan\r\ntroops will cease immediately, both by land and water.\r\n\r\n   \"Article III. The Mexican troops will evacuate the territory\r\nof Texas, passing to the other side of the Rio Grande Del Norte.\r\n\r\n   \"Article IV. The Mexican army, in its retreat, shall not\r\ntake the property of any person without his consent and just\r\nindemnification, using only such articles as may be necessary for its\r\nsubsistence, in cases when the owner may not be present, and remitting\r\nto the commander of the army of Texas, or to the commissioners to be\r\nappointed for the adjustment of such matters, an account of the value of\r\nthe property consumed, the place where taken, and the name of the owner,\r\nif it can be ascertained.\r\n\r\n   \"Article V. That all private property, including cattle,\r\nhorses, negro slaves, or indentured persons, of whatever denomination,\r\nthat may have been captured by any portion of the Mexican army, or may\r\nhave taken refuge in the said army, since the commencement of the late\r\ninvasion, shall be restored to the commander of the Texan army, or to such\r\nother persons as may be appointed by the Government of Texas to receive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n   \"Article VI. The troops of both armies will refrain from\r\ncoming in contact with each other; and to this end the commander of the\r\narmy of Texas will be careful not to approach within a shorter distance\r\nthan five leagues.\r\n\r\n   \"Article VII. The Mexican army shall not make any other\r\ndelay on its march than that which is necessary to take up their\r\nhospitals, baggage, etc., and to cross the rivers; any delay not necessary\r\nto these purposes to be considered an infraction of this agreement.\r\n\r\n   \"Article VIII. By an express, to be immediately despatched,\r\nthis agreement shall be sent to General Vincente Filisola and to General\r\nT. J.

GRAYSON, Attorney-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JANUARY 19, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, from the Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, made\r\nthe following report:\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, to whom was referred the\r\npetition of Messrs. Saltmarsh and Fuller, report: That, as proved to\r\ntheir satisfaction, the mail routes from Milledgeville to Athens, and from\r\nWarrenton to Decatur, in the State of Georgia (numbered 2366 and 2380),\r\nwere let to Reeside and Avery at $1300 per annum for the former and $1500\r\nfor the latter, for the term of four years, to commence on the first day\r\nof January, 1835; that, previous to the time for commencing the service,\r\nReeside sold his interest therein to Avery; that on the 5th of May, 1835,\r\nAvery sold the whole to these petitioners, Saltmarsh and Fuller, to\r\ntake effect from the beginning, January a 1835; that at this time, the\r\nAssistant Postmaster-General, being called on for that purpose, consented\r\nto the transfer of the contracts from Reeside and Avery to these\r\npetitioners, and promised to have proper entries of the transfer made on\r\nthe books of the department, which, however, was neglected to be done;\r\nthat the petitioners, supposing all was right, in good faith commenced the\r\ntransportation of the mail on these routes, and after difficulty arose,\r\nstill trusting that all would be made right, continued the service\r\ntill December a 1837; that they performed the service to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of the department, and have never been paid anything for it\r\nexcept $----; that the difficulty occurred as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. Barry was Postmaster-General at the times of making the contracts\r\nand the attempted transfer of them; Mr. Kendall succeeded Mr. Barry, and\r\nfinding Reeside apparently in debt to the department, and these contracts\r\nstill standing in the names of Reeside and Avery, refused to pay for the\r\nservices under them, otherwise than by credits to Reeside; afterward,\r\nhowever, he divided the compensation, still crediting one half to Reeside,\r\nand directing the other to be paid to the order of Avery, who disclaimed\r\nall right to it. After discontinuing the service, these petitioners,\r\nsupposing they might have legal redress against Avery, brought suit\r\nagainst him in New Orleans; in which suit they failed, on the ground\r\nthat Avery had complied with his contract, having done so much toward the\r\ntransfer as they had accepted and been satisfied with. Still later the\r\ndepartment sued Reeside on his supposed indebtedness, and by a verdict of\r\nthe jury it was determined that the department was indebted to him in a\r\nsum much beyond all the credits given him on the account above stated.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the committee consider the petitioners clearly\r\nentitled to relief, and they report a bill accordingly; lest, however,\r\nthere should be some mistake as to the amount which they have already\r\nreceived, we so frame it as that, by adjustment at the department, they\r\nmay be paid so much as remains unpaid for services actually performed by\r\nthem not charging them with the credits given to Reeside. The committee\r\nthink it not improbable that the petitioners purchased the right of Avery\r\nto be paid for the service from the 1st of January, till their purchase\r\non May 11, 1835; but, the evidence on this point being very vague, they\r\nforbear to report in favor of allowing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON--LEGAL WORK\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 19, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Inclosed you find a letter of Louis W. Chandler. What\r\nis wanted is that you shall ascertain whether the claim upon the note\r\ndescribed has received any dividend in the Probate Court of Christian\r\nCounty, where the estate of Mr. Overbon Williams has been administered\r\non. If nothing is paid on it, withdraw the note and send it to me, so that\r\nChandler can see the indorser of it. At all events write me all about it,\r\ntill I can somehow get it off my hands. I have already been bored more\r\nthan enough about it; not the least of which annoyance is his cursed,\r\nunreadable, and ungodly handwriting.\r\n\r\nI have made a speech, a copy of which I will send you by next mail.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING SPEECH ON MEXICAN WAR\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 1, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Your letter of the 19th ultimo was received last night, and\r\nfor which I am much obliged. The only thing in it that I wish to talk to\r\nyou at once about is that because of my vote for Ashmun's amendment you\r\nfear that you and I disagree about the war. I regret this, not because of\r\nany fear we shall remain disagreed after you have read this letter, but\r\nbecause if you misunderstand I fear other good friends may also. That vote\r\naffirms that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by\r\nthe President; and I will stake my life that if you had been in my place\r\nyou would have voted just as I did. Would you have voted what you felt\r\nand knew to be a lie? I know you would not. Would you have gone out of the\r\nHouse--skulked the vote? I expect not. If you had skulked one vote,\r\nyou would have had to skulk many more before the end of the session.\r\nRichardson's resolutions, introduced before I made any move or gave any\r\nvote upon the subject, make the direct question of the justice of the war;\r\nso that no man can be silent if he would. You are compelled to speak; and\r\nyour only alternative is to tell the truth or a lie. I cannot doubt which\r\nyou would do.\r\n\r\nThis vote has nothing to do in determining my votes on the questions of\r\nsupplies. I have always intended, and still intend, to vote supplies;\r\nperhaps not in the precise form recommended by the President, but in a\r\nbetter form for all purposes, except Locofoco party purposes. It is in\r\nthis particular you seem mistaken. The Locos are untiring in their efforts\r\nto make the impression that all who vote supplies or take part in the war\r\ndo of necessity approve the President's conduct in the beginning of\r\nit; but the Whigs have from the beginning made and kept the distinction\r\nbetween the two. In the very first act nearly all the Whigs voted against\r\nthe preamble declaring that war existed by the act of Mexico; and yet\r\nnearly all of them voted for the supplies. As to the Whig men who have\r\nparticipated in the war, so far as they have spoken in my hearing they\r\ndo not hesitate to denounce as unjust the President's conduct in the\r\nbeginning of the war. They do not suppose that such denunciation is\r\ndirected by undying hatred to him, as The Register would have it believed.\r\nThere are two such Whigs on this floor (Colonel Haskell and Major James)\r\nThe former fought as a colonel by the side of Colonel Baker at Cerro\r\nGordo, and stands side by side with me in the vote that you seem\r\ndissatisfied with. The latter, the history of whose capture with Cassius\r\nClay you well know, had not arrived here when that vote was given; but,\r\nas I understand, he stands ready to give just such a vote whenever an\r\noccasion shall present. Baker, too, who is now here, says the truth is\r\nundoubtedly that way; and whenever he shall speak out, he will say so.\r\nColonel Doniphan, too, the favorite Whig of Missouri, and who overran\r\nall Northern Mexico, on his return home in a public speech at St. Louis\r\ncondemned the administration in relation to the war. If I remember, G. T.\r\nM. Davis, who has been through almost the whole war, declares in favor of\r\nMr. Clay; from which I infer that he adopts the sentiments of Mr. Clay,\r\ngenerally at least. On the other hand, I have heard of but one Whig who\r\nhas been to the war attempting to justify the President's conduct. That\r\none was Captain Bishop, editor of the Charleston Courier, and a very\r\nclever fellow. I do not mean this letter for the public, but for you.\r\nBefore it reaches you, you will have seen and read my pamphlet speech,\r\nand perhaps been scared anew by it. After you get over your scare, read it\r\nover again, sentence by sentence, and tell me honestly what you think of\r\nit. I condensed all I could for fear of being cut off by the hour rule,\r\nand when I got through I had spoken but forty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nYours forever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 2, 1848\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--I just take my pen to say that Mr. Stephens, of Georgia, a\r\nlittle, slim, pale-faced, consumptive man, with a voice like Logan's, has\r\njust concluded the very best speech of an hour's length I ever heard. My\r\nold withered dry eyes are full of tears yet.\r\n\r\nIf he writes it out anything like he delivered it, our people shall see a\r\ngood many copies of it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE MEXICAN WAR\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 15, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Your letter of the 29th January was received last night.\r\nBeing exclusively a constitutional argument, I wish to submit some\r\nreflections upon it in the same spirit of kindness that I know actuates\r\nyou. Let me first state what I understand to be your position. It is that\r\nif it shall become necessary to repel invasion, the President may, without\r\nviolation of the Constitution, cross the line and invade the territory of\r\nanother country, and that whether such necessity exists in any given case\r\nthe President is the sole judge.\r\n\r\nBefore going further consider well whether this is or is not your\r\nposition. If it is, it is a position that neither the President himself,\r\nnor any friend of his, so far as I know, has ever taken. Their only\r\npositions are--first, that the soil was ours when the hostilities\r\ncommenced; and second, that whether it was rightfully ours or not,\r\nCongress had annexed it, and the President for that reason was bound to\r\ndefend it; both of which are as clearly proved to be false in fact as you\r\ncan prove that your house is mine. The soil was not ours, and Congress did\r\nnot annex or attempt to annex it. But to return to your position. Allow\r\nthe President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it\r\nnecessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so whenever he may\r\nchoose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose, and you allow him to\r\nmake war at pleasure. Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power\r\nin this respect, after having given him so much as you propose. If to-day\r\nhe should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent\r\nthe British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to\r\nhim,--\"I see no probability of the British invading us\"; but he will say\r\nto you, \"Be silent: I see it, if you don't.\"\r\n\r\nThe provision of the Constitution giving the war making power to Congress\r\nwas dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons: kings had\r\nalways been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending\r\ngenerally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object.\r\nThis our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly\r\noppressions, and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one\r\nman should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. But your\r\nview destroys the whole matter, and places our President where kings have\r\nalways stood. Write soon again.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nMARCH 9, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, from the Committee on the Postoffice and Post Roads, made the\r\nfollowing report:\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, to whom was referred the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives entitled \"An Act authorizing\r\npostmasters at county seats of justice to receive subscriptions for\r\nnewspapers and periodicals, to be paid through the agency of the\r\nPost-office Department, and for other purposes,\" beg leave to submit the\r\nfollowing report:\r\n\r\nThe committee have reason to believe that a general wish pervades the\r\ncommunity at large that some such facility as the proposed measure should\r\nbe granted by express law, for subscribing, through the agency of the\r\nPost-office Department, to newspapers and periodicals which diffuse daily,\r\nweekly, or monthly intelligence of passing events. Compliance with\r\nthis general wish is deemed to be in accordance with our republican\r\ninstitutions, which can be best sustained by the diffusion of knowledge\r\nand the due encouragement of a universal, national spirit of inquiry and\r\ndiscussion of public events through the medium of the public press. The\r\ncommittee, however, has not been insensible to its duty of guarding the\r\nPost-office Department against injurious sacrifices for the accomplishment\r\nof this object, whereby its ordinary efficacy might be impaired or\r\nembarrassed. It has therefore been a subject of much consideration; but\r\nit is now confidently hoped that the bill herewith submitted effectually\r\nobviates all objections which might exist with regard to a less matured\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nThe committee learned, upon inquiry, that the Post-office Department,\r\nin view of meeting the general wish on this subject, made the experiment\r\nthrough one if its own internal regulations, when the new postage system\r\nwent into operation on the first of July, 1845, and that it was continued\r\nuntil the thirtieth of September, 1847. But this experiment, for reasons\r\nhereafter stated, proved unsatisfactory, and it was discontinued by\r\norder of the Postmaster-General. As far as the committee can at present\r\nascertain, the following seem to have been the principal grounds of\r\ndissatisfaction in this experiment:\r\n\r\n(1) The legal responsibility of postmasters receiving newspaper\r\nsubscriptions, or of their sureties, was not defined.\r\n\r\n(2) The authority was open to all postmasters instead of being limited to\r\nthose of specific offices.\r\n\r\n(3) The consequence of this extension of authority was that, in\r\ninnumerable instances, the money, without the previous knowledge or\r\ncontrol of the officers of the department who are responsible for the good\r\nmanagement of its finances, was deposited in offices where it was improper\r\nsuch funds should be placed; and the repayment was ordered, not by\r\nthe financial officers, but by the postmasters, at points where it was\r\ninconvenient to the department so to disburse its funds.\r\n\r\n(4) The inconvenience of accumulating uncertain and fluctuating sums at\r\nsmall offices was felt seriously in consequent overpayments to contractors\r\non their quarterly collecting orders; and, in case of private mail routes,\r\nin litigation concerning the misapplication of such funds to the special\r\nservice of supplying mails.\r\n\r\n(5) The accumulation of such funds on draft offices could not be known\r\nto the financial clerks of the department in time to control it, and too\r\noften this rendered uncertain all their calculations of funds in hand.\r\n\r\n(6) The orders of payment were for the most part issued upon the principal\r\noffices, such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, etc., where\r\nthe large offices of publishers are located, causing an illimitable and\r\nuncontrollable drain of the department funds from those points where\r\nit was essential to husband them for its own regular disbursements. In\r\nPhiladelphia alone this drain averaged $5000 per quarter; and in other\r\ncities of the seaboard it was proportionate.\r\n\r\n(7) The embarrassment of the department was increased by the illimitable,\r\nuncontrollable, and irresponsible scattering of its funds from\r\nconcentrated points suitable for its distributions, to remote, unsafe, and\r\ninconvenient offices, where they could not be again made available till\r\ncollected by special agents, or were transferred at considerable expense\r\ninto the principal disbursing offices again.\r\n\r\n(8) There was a vast increase of duties thrown upon the limited force\r\nbefore necessary to conduct the business of the department; and from the\r\ndelay of obtaining vouchers impediments arose to the speedy settlement of\r\naccounts with present or retired post-masters, causing postponements which\r\nendangered the liability of sureties under the act of limitations, and\r\ncausing much danger of an increase of such cases.\r\n\r\n(9) The most responsible postmasters (at the large offices) were ordered\r\nby the least responsible (at small offices) to make payments upon their\r\nvouchers, without having the means of ascertaining whether these vouchers\r\nwere genuine or forged, or if genuine, whether the signers were in or out\r\nof office, or solvent or defaulters.\r\n\r\n(10) The transaction of this business for subscribers and publishers at\r\nthe public expense, an the embarrassment, inconvenience, and delay of\r\nthe department's own business occasioned by it, were not justified by any\r\nsufficient remuneration of revenue to sustain the department, as required\r\nin every other respect with regard to its agency.\r\n\r\nThe committee, in view of these objections, has been solicitous to frame\r\na bill which would not be obnoxious to them in principle or in practical\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently believed that by limiting the offices for receiving\r\nsubscriptions to less than one tenth of the number authorized by the\r\nexperiment already tried, and designating the county seat in each\r\ncounty for the purpose, the control of the department will be rendered\r\nsatisfactory; particularly as it will be in the power of the Auditor,\r\nwho is the officer required by law to check the accounts, to approve or\r\ndisapprove of the deposits, and to sanction not only the payments, but to\r\npoint out the place of payment. If these payments should cause a drain\r\non the principal offices of the seaboard, it will be compensated by the\r\naccumulation of funds at county seats, where the contractors on those\r\nroutes can be paid to that extent by the department's drafts, with more\r\nlocal convenience to themselves than by drafts on the seaboard offices.\r\n\r\nThe legal responsibility for these deposits is defined, and the\r\naccumulation of funds at the point of deposit, and the repayment at\r\npoints drawn upon, being known to and controlled by the Auditor, will not\r\noccasion any such embarrassments as were before felt; the record kept\r\nby the Auditor on the passing of the certificates through his hands will\r\nenable him to settle accounts without the delay occasioned by vouchers\r\nbeing withheld; all doubt or uncertainty as to the genuineness of\r\ncertificates, or the propriety of their issue, will be removed by the\r\nAuditor's examination and approval; and there can be no risk of loss\r\nof funds by transmission, as the certificate will not be payable till\r\nsanctioned by the Auditor, and after his sanction the payor need not pay\r\nit unless it is presented by the publisher or his known clerk or agent.\r\n\r\nThe main principle of equivalent for the agency of the department is\r\nsecured by the postage required to be paid upon the transmission of the\r\ncertificates, augmenting adequately the post-office revenue.\r\n\r\nThe committee, conceiving that in this report all the difficulties of the\r\nsubject have been fully and fairly stated, and that these difficulties\r\nhave been obviated by the plan proposed in the accompanying bill, and\r\nbelieving that the measure will satisfactorily meet the wants and wishes\r\nof a very large portion of the community, beg leave to recommend its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nMARCH 9, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, from the Committee on the Postoffice and Post Roads, made the\r\nfollowing report:\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, to whom was referred\r\nthe petition of H. M. Barney, postmaster at Brimfield, Peoria County,\r\nIllinois, report: That they have been satisfied by evidence, that on the\r\n15th of December, 1847, said petitioner had his store, with some fifteen\r\nhundred dollars' worth of goods, together with all the papers of the\r\npost-office, entirely destroyed by fire; and that the specie funds of the\r\noffice were melted down, partially lost and partially destroyed; that this\r\nlarge individual loss entirely precludes the idea of embezzlement; that\r\nthe balances due the department of former quarters had been only about\r\ntwenty-five dollars; and that owing to the destruction of papers, the\r\nexact amount due for the quarter ending December 31, 1847, cannot be\r\nascertained. They therefore report a joint resolution, releasing said\r\npetitioner from paying anything for the quarter last mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, MARCH 29, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe bill for raising additional military force for limited time, etc., was\r\nreported from Committee on judiciary; similar bills had been reported from\r\nCommittee on, Public Lands and Military Committee.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said if there was a general desire on the part of the House to\r\npass the bill now he should be glad to have it done--concurring, as he\r\ndid generally, with the gentleman from Arkansas [Mr. Johnson] that the\r\npostponement might jeopard the safety of the proposition. If, however, a\r\nreference was to be made, he wished to make a very few remarks in relation\r\nto the several subjects desired by the gentlemen to be embraced in\r\namendments to the ninth section of the act of the last session of\r\nCongress. The first amendment desired by members of this House had for its\r\nonly object to give bounty lands to such persons as had served for a time\r\nas privates, but had never been discharged as such, because promoted to\r\noffice. That subject, and no other, was embraced in this bill. There were\r\nsome others who desired, while they were legislating on this subject, that\r\nthey should also give bounty lands to the volunteers of the War of 1812.\r\nHis friend from Maryland said there were no such men. He [Mr. L.] did not\r\nsay there were many, but he was very confident there were some. His friend\r\nfrom Kentucky near him, [Mr. Gaines] told him he himself was one.\r\n\r\nThere was still another proposition touching this matter; that was, that\r\npersons entitled to bounty lands should by law be entitled to locate these\r\nlands in parcels, and not be required to locate them in one body, as was\r\nprovided by the existing law.\r\n\r\nNow he had carefully drawn up a bill embracing these three separate\r\npropositions, which he intended to propose as a substitute for all these\r\nbills in the House, or in Committee of the Whole on the State of the\r\nUnion, at some suitable time. If there was a disposition on the part of\r\nthe House to act at once on this separate proposition, he repeated that,\r\nwith the gentlemen from Arkansas, he should prefer it lest they should\r\nlose all. But if there was to be a reference, he desired to introduce his\r\nbill embracing the three propositions, thus enabling the committee and the\r\nHouse to act at the same time, whether favorably or unfavorably, upon all.\r\nHe inquired whether an amendment was now in order.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker replied in the negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARCHIBALD WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 30, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAMS:--I have not seen in the papers any evidence of a movement\r\nto send a delegate from your circuit to the June convention. I wish to say\r\nthat I think it all-important that a delegate should be sent. Mr. Clay's\r\nchance for an election is just no chance at all. He might get New York,\r\nand that would have elected in 1844, but it will not now, because he must\r\nnow, at the least, lose Tennessee, which he had then, and in addition the\r\nfifteen new votes of Florida, Texas, Iowa, and Wisconsin. I know our good\r\nfriend Browning is a great admirer of Mr. Clay, and I therefore fear he is\r\nfavoring his nomination. If he is, ask him to discard feeling, and try\r\nif he can possibly, as a matter of judgment, count the votes necessary to\r\nelect him.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment we can elect nobody but General Taylor; and we cannot elect\r\nhim without a nomination. Therefore don't fail to send a delegate.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nMAY 11, 1848.\r\n\r\nA bill for the admission of Wisconsin into the Union had been passed.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed.\r\nHe stated to the House that he had made this motion for the purpose of\r\nobtaining an opportunity to say a few words in relation to a point raised\r\nin the course of the debate on this bill, which he would now proceed to\r\nmake if in order. The point in the case to which he referred arose on the\r\namendment that was submitted by the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Collamer]\r\nin Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union, and which was\r\nafterward renewed in the House, in relation to the question whether the\r\nreserved sections, which, by some bills heretofore passed, by which an\r\nappropriation of land had been made to Wisconsin, had been enhanced in\r\nvalue, should be reduced to the minimum price of the public lands. The\r\nquestion of the reduction in value of those sections was to him at this\r\ntime a matter very nearly of indifference. He was inclined to desire that\r\nWisconsin should be obliged by having it reduced. But the gentleman from\r\nIndiana [Mr. C. B. Smith], the chairman of the Committee on Territories,\r\nyesterday associated that question with the general question, which is now\r\nto some extent agitated in Congress, of making appropriations of alternate\r\nsections of land to aid the States in making internal improvements, and\r\nenhancing the price of the sections reserved, and the gentleman from\r\nIndiana took ground against that policy. He did not make any special\r\nargument in favor of Wisconsin, but he took ground generally against the\r\npolicy of giving alternate sections of land, and enhancing the price of\r\nthe reserved sections. Now he [Mr. Lincoln] did not at this time take the\r\nfloor for the purpose of attempting to make an argument on the general\r\nsubject. He rose simply to protest against the doctrine which the\r\ngentleman from Indiana had avowed in the course of what he [Mr. Lincoln]\r\ncould not but consider an unsound argument.\r\n\r\nIt might, however, be true, for anything he knew, that the gentleman\r\nfrom Indiana might convince him that his argument was sound; but he [Mr.\r\nLincoln] feared that gentleman would not be able to convince a majority\r\nin Congress that it was sound. It was true the question appeared in a\r\ndifferent aspect to persons in consequence of a difference in the point\r\nfrom which they looked at it. It did not look to persons residing east of\r\nthe mountains as it did to those who lived among the public lands. But,\r\nfor his part, he would state that if Congress would make a donation of\r\nalternate sections of public land for the purpose of internal improvements\r\nin his State, and forbid the reserved sections being sold at $1.25, he\r\nshould be glad to see the appropriation made; though he should prefer\r\nit if the reserved sections were not enhanced in price. He repeated, he\r\nshould be glad to have such appropriations made, even though the reserved\r\nsections should be enhanced in price. He did not wish to be understood\r\nas concurring in any intimation that they would refuse to receive such an\r\nappropriation of alternate sections of land because a condition enhancing\r\nthe price of the reserved sections should be attached thereto. He believed\r\nhis position would now be understood: if not, he feared he should not be\r\nable to make himself understood.\r\n\r\nBut, before he took his seat, he would remark that the Senate during the\r\npresent session had passed a bill making appropriations of land on that\r\nprinciple for the benefit of the State in which he resided the State\r\nof Illinois. The alternate sections were to be given for the purpose of\r\nconstructing roads, and the reserved sections were to be enhanced in value\r\nin consequence. When that bill came here for the action of this House--it\r\nhad been received, and was now before the Committee on Public Lands--he\r\ndesired much to see it passed as it was, if it could be put in no more\r\nfavorable form for the State of Illinois. When it should be before this\r\nHouse, if any member from a section of the Union in which these lands\r\ndid not lie, whose interest might be less than that which he felt, should\r\npropose a reduction of the price of the reserved sections to $1.25, he\r\nshould be much obliged; but he did not think it would be well for those\r\nwho came from the section of the Union in which the lands lay to do\r\nso.--He wished it, then, to be understood that he did not join in the\r\nwarfare against the principle which had engaged the minds of some members\r\nof Congress who were favorable to the improvements in the western country.\r\nThere was a good deal of force, he admitted, in what fell from the\r\nchairman of the Committee on Territories. It might be that there was no\r\nprecise justice in raising the price of the reserved sections to $2.50 per\r\nacre. It might be proper that the price should be enhanced to some extent,\r\nthough not to double the usual price; but he should be glad to have such\r\nan appropriation with the reserved sections at $2.50; he should be better\r\npleased to have the price of those sections at something less; and he\r\nshould be still better pleased to have them without any enhancement at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThere was one portion of the argument of the gentleman from Indiana, the\r\nchairman of the Committee on Territories [Mr. Smith], which he wished to\r\ntake occasion to say that he did not view as unsound. He alluded to the\r\nstatement that the General Government was interested in these internal\r\nimprovements being made, inasmuch as they increased the value of the lands\r\nthat were unsold, and they enabled the government to sell the lands which\r\ncould not be sold without them. Thus, then, the government gained by\r\ninternal improvements as well as by the general good which the people\r\nderived from them, and it might be, therefore, that the lands should\r\nnot be sold for more than $1.50 instead of the price being doubled. He,\r\nhowever, merely mentioned this in passing, for he only rose to state,\r\nas the principle of giving these lands for the purposes which he had\r\nmentioned had been laid hold of and considered favorably, and as there\r\nwere some gentlemen who had constitutional scruples about giving money\r\nfor these purchases who would not hesitate to give land, that he was\r\nnot willing to have it understood that he was one of those who made\r\nwar against that principle. This was all he desired to say, and having\r\naccomplished the object with which he rose, he withdrew his motion to\r\nreconsider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON TAYLOR'S NOMINATION\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 30,1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WASHBURNE:\r\n\r\nI have this moment received your very short note asking me if old Taylor\r\nis to be used up, and who will be the nominee. My hope of Taylor's\r\nnomination is as high--a little higher than it was when you left. Still,\r\nthe case is by no means out of doubt. Mr. Clay's letter has not advanced\r\nhis interests any here. Several who were against Taylor, but not for\r\nanybody particularly, before, are since taking ground, some for Scott\r\nand some for McLean. Who will be nominated neither I nor any one else can\r\ntell. Now, let me pray to you in turn. My prayer is that you let nothing\r\ndiscourage or baffle you, but that, in spite of every difficulty, you send\r\nus a good Taylor delegate from your circuit. Make Baker, who is now with\r\nyou, I suppose, help about it. He is a good hand to raise a breeze.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ashley, in the Senate from Arkansas, died yesterday. Nothing else\r\nnew beyond what you see in the papers.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENSE OF MEXICAN WAR POSITION\r\n\r\nTO REV. J. M. PECK\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 21, 1848. DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n....Not in view of all the facts. There are facts which you have kept out\r\nof view. It is a fact that the United States army in marching to the Rio\r\nGrande marched into a peaceful Mexican settlement, and frightened the\r\ninhabitants away from their homes and their growing crops. It is a fact\r\nthat Fort Brown, opposite Matamoras, was built by that army within a\r\nMexican cotton-field, on which at the time the army reached it a young\r\ncotton crop was growing, and which crop was wholly destroyed and the field\r\nitself greatly and permanently injured by ditches, embankments, and the\r\nlike. It is a fact that when the Mexicans captured Captain Thornton and\r\nhis command, they found and captured them within another Mexican field.\r\n\r\nNow I wish to bring these facts to your notice, and to ascertain what is\r\nthe result of your reflections upon them. If you deny that they are\r\nfacts, I think I can furnish proofs which shall convince you that you are\r\nmistaken. If you admit that they are facts, then I shall be obliged for\r\na reference to any law of language, law of States, law of nations, law of\r\nmorals, law of religions, any law, human or divine, in which an authority\r\ncan be found for saying those facts constitute \"no aggression.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly you consider those acts too small for notice. Would you venture\r\nto so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against\r\nthe humblest of our people? I know you would not. Then I ask, is the\r\nprecept \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to\r\nthem\" obsolete? of no force? of no application?\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON ZACHARY TAYLOR NOMINATION\r\n\r\nTO ARCHIBALD WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 12, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAMS:--On my return from Philadelphia, where I had been attending\r\nthe nomination of \"Old Rough,\" (Zachary Taylor) I found your letter in a\r\nmass of others which had accumulated in my absence. By many, and often, it\r\nhad been said they would not abide the nomination of Taylor; but since the\r\ndeed has been done, they are fast falling in, and in my opinion we shall\r\nhave a most overwhelming, glorious triumph. One unmistakable sign is that\r\nall the odds and ends are with us--Barnburners, Native Americans, Tyler\r\nmen, disappointed office-seeking Locofocos, and the Lord knows what. This\r\nis important, if in nothing else, in showing which way the wind blows.\r\nSome of the sanguine men have set down all the States as certain for\r\nTaylor but Illinois, and it as doubtful. Cannot something be done even in\r\nIllinois? Taylor's nomination takes the Locos on the blind side. It turns\r\nthe war thunder against them. The war is now to them the gallows of\r\nHaman, which they built for us, and on which they are doomed to be hanged\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nExcuse this short letter. I have so many to write that I cannot devote\r\nmuch time to any one.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nJUNE 20, 1848.\r\n\r\nIn Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union, on the Civil and\r\nDiplomatic Appropriation Bill:\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN:--I wish at all times in no way to practise any fraud upon\r\nthe House or the committee, and I also desire to do nothing which may be\r\nvery disagreeable to any of the members. I therefore state in advance that\r\nmy object in taking the floor is to make a speech on the general subject\r\nof internal improvements; and if I am out of order in doing so, I give the\r\nchair an opportunity of so deciding, and I will take my seat.\r\n\r\nThe Chair: I will not undertake to anticipate what the gentleman may say\r\non the subject of internal improvements. He will, therefore, proceed in\r\nhis remarks, and if any question of order shall be made, the chair will\r\nthen decide it.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln: At an early day of this session the President sent us what\r\nmay properly be called an internal improvement veto message. The late\r\nDemocratic convention, which sat at Baltimore, and which nominated General\r\nCass for the Presidency, adopted a set of resolutions, now called the\r\nDemocratic platform, among which is one in these words:\r\n\r\n\"That the Constitution does not confer upon the General Government the\r\npower to commence and carry on a general system of internal improvements.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Cass, in his letter accepting the nomination, holds this language:\r\n\r\n\"I have carefully read the resolutions of the Democratic national\r\nconvention, laying down the platform of our political faith, and I adhere\r\nto them as firmly as I approve them cordially.\"\r\n\r\nThese things, taken together, show that the question of internal\r\nimprovements is now more distinctly made--has become more intense--than\r\nat any former period. The veto message and the Baltimore resolution I\r\nunderstand to be, in substance, the same thing; the latter being the more\r\ngeneral statement, of which the former is the amplification the bill of\r\nparticulars. While I know there are many Democrats, on this floor and\r\nelsewhere, who disapprove that message, I understand that all who voted\r\nfor General Cass will thereafter be counted as having approved it, as\r\nhaving indorsed all its doctrines.\r\n\r\nI suppose all, or nearly all, the Democrats will vote for him. Many of\r\nthem will do so not because they like his position on this question,\r\nbut because they prefer him, being wrong on this, to another whom they\r\nconsider farther wrong on other questions. In this way the internal\r\nimprovement Democrats are to be, by a sort of forced consent, carried over\r\nand arrayed against themselves on this measure of policy. General Cass,\r\nonce elected, will not trouble himself to make a constitutional argument,\r\nor perhaps any argument at all, when he shall veto a river or harbor bill;\r\nhe will consider it a sufficient answer to all Democratic murmurs to point\r\nto Mr. Polk's message, and to the Democratic platform. This being the\r\ncase, the question of improvements is verging to a final crisis; and the\r\nfriends of this policy must now battle, and battle manfully, or surrender\r\nall. In this view, humble as I am, I wish to review, and contest as well\r\nas I may, the general positions of this veto message. When I say general\r\npositions, I mean to exclude from consideration so much as relates to the\r\npresent embarrassed state of the treasury in consequence of the Mexican\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nThose general positions are: that internal improvements ought not to be\r\nmade by the General Government--First. Because they would overwhelm the\r\ntreasury Second. Because, while their burdens would be general, their\r\nbenefits would be local and partial, involving an obnoxious inequality;\r\nand Third. Because they would be unconstitutional. Fourth. Because the\r\nStates may do enough by the levy and collection of tonnage duties; or if\r\nnot--Fifth. That the Constitution may be amended. \"Do nothing at all, lest\r\nyou do something wrong,\" is the sum of these positions is the sum of\r\nthis message. And this, with the exception of what is said about\r\nconstitutionality, applying as forcibly to what is said about making\r\nimprovements by State authority as by the national authority; so that we\r\nmust abandon the improvements of the country altogether, by any and every\r\nauthority, or we must resist and repudiate the doctrines of this message.\r\nLet us attempt the latter.\r\n\r\nThe first position is, that a system of internal improvements would\r\noverwhelm the treasury. That in such a system there is a tendency to undue\r\nexpansion, is not to be denied. Such tendency is founded in the nature\r\nof the subject. A member of Congress will prefer voting for a bill which\r\ncontains an appropriation for his district, to voting for one which\r\ndoes not; and when a bill shall be expanded till every district shall be\r\nprovided for, that it will be too greatly expanded is obvious. But is\r\nthis any more true in Congress than in a State Legislature? If a member\r\nof Congress must have an appropriation for his district, so a member of\r\na Legislature must have one for his county. And if one will overwhelm\r\nthe national treasury, so the other will overwhelm the State treasury. Go\r\nwhere we will, the difficulty is the same. Allow it to drive us from the\r\nhalls of Congress, and it will, just as easily, drive us from the State\r\nLegislatures. Let us, then, grapple with it, and test its strength. Let\r\nus, judging of the future by the past, ascertain whether there may not be,\r\nin the discretion of Congress, a sufficient power to limit and restrain\r\nthis expansive tendency within reasonable and proper bounds. The President\r\nhimself values the evidence of the past. He tells us that at a certain\r\npoint of our history more than two hundred millions of dollars had been\r\napplied for to make improvements; and this he does to prove that the\r\ntreasury would be overwhelmed by such a system. Why did he not tell us how\r\nmuch was granted? Would not that have been better evidence? Let us turn\r\nto it, and see what it proves. In the message the President tells us\r\nthat \"during the four succeeding years embraced by the administration of\r\nPresident Adams, the power not only to appropriate money, but to apply it,\r\nunder the direction and authority of the General Government, as well to\r\nthe construction of roads as to the improvement of harbors and rivers,\r\nwas fully asserted and exercised.\" This, then, was the period of greatest\r\nenormity. These, if any, must have been the days of the two hundred\r\nmillions. And how much do you suppose was really expended for improvements\r\nduring that four years? Two hundred millions? One hundred? Fifty? Ten?\r\nFive? No, sir; less than two millions. As shown by authentic documents,\r\nthe expenditures on improvements during 1825, 1826, 1827, and 1828\r\namounted to one million eight hundred and seventy-nine thousand six\r\nhundred and twenty-seven dollars and one cent. These four years were the\r\nperiod of Mr. Adams's administration, nearly and substantially. This fact\r\nshows that when the power to make improvements \"was fully asserted and\r\nexercised,\" the Congress did keep within reasonable limits; and what has\r\nbeen done, it seems to me, can be done again.\r\n\r\nNow for the second portion of the message--namely, that the burdens of\r\nimprovements would be general, while their benefits would be local and\r\npartial, involving an obnoxious inequality. That there is some degree\r\nof truth in this position, I shall not deny. No commercial object of\r\ngovernment patronage can be so exclusively general as to not be of some\r\npeculiar local advantage. The navy, as I understand it, was established,\r\nand is maintained at a great annual expense, partly to be ready for\r\nwar when war shall come, and partly also, and perhaps chiefly, for the\r\nprotection of our commerce on the high seas. This latter object is, for\r\nall I can see, in principle the same as internal improvements. The driving\r\na pirate from the track of commerce on the broad ocean, and the removing\r\nof a snag from its more narrow path in the Mississippi River, cannot,\r\nI think, be distinguished in principle. Each is done to save life and\r\nproperty, and for nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe navy, then, is the most general in its benefits of all this class\r\nof objects; and yet even the navy is of some peculiar advantage to\r\nCharleston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, beyond what it\r\nis to the interior towns of Illinois. The next most general object I\r\ncan think of would be improvements on the Mississippi River and its\r\ntributaries. They touch thirteen of our States-Pennsylvania, Virginia,\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa. Now I suppose it will not be denied\r\nthat these thirteen States are a little more interested in improvements on\r\nthat great river than are the remaining seventeen. These instances of the\r\nnavy and the Mississippi River show clearly that there is something of\r\nlocal advantage in the most general objects. But the converse is also\r\ntrue. Nothing is so local as to not be of some general benefit. Take,\r\nfor instance, the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Considered apart from its\r\neffects, it is perfectly local. Every inch of it is within the State of\r\nIllinois. That canal was first opened for business last April. In a very\r\nfew days we were all gratified to learn, among other things, that sugar\r\nhad been carried from New Orleans through this canal to Buffalo in New\r\nYork. This sugar took this route, doubtless, because it was cheaper than\r\nthe old route. Supposing benefit of the reduction in the cost of carriage\r\nto be shared between seller and the buyer, result is that the New Orleans\r\nmerchant sold his sugar a little dearer, and the people of Buffalo\r\nsweetened their coffee a little cheaper, than before,--a benefit resulting\r\nfrom the canal, not to Illinois, where the canal is, but to Louisiana and\r\nNew York, where it is not. In other transactions Illinois will, of course,\r\nhave her share, and perhaps the larger share too, of the benefits of the\r\ncanal; but this instance of the sugar clearly shows that the benefits of\r\nan improvement are by no means confined to the particular locality of\r\nthe improvement itself. The just conclusion from all this is that if the\r\nnation refuse to make improvements of the more general kind because their\r\nbenefits may be somewhat local, a State may for the same reason refuse to\r\nmake an improvement of a local kind because its benefits may be somewhat\r\ngeneral. A State may well say to the nation, \"If you will do nothing for\r\nme, I will do nothing for you.\" Thus it is seen that if this argument of\r\n\"inequality\" is sufficient anywhere, it is sufficient everywhere, and puts\r\nan end to improvements altogether. I hope and believe that if both the\r\nnation and the States would, in good faith, in their respective spheres\r\ndo what they could in the way of improvements, what of inequality might be\r\nproduced in one place might be compensated in another, and the sum of the\r\nwhole might not be very unequal.\r\n\r\nBut suppose, after all, there should be some degree of inequality.\r\nInequality is certainly never to be embraced for its own sake; but is\r\nevery good thing to be discarded which may be inseparably connected with\r\nsome degree of it? If so, we must discard all government. This Capitol\r\nis built at the public expense, for the public benefit; but does any one\r\ndoubt that it is of some peculiar local advantage to the property-holders\r\nand business people of Washington? Shall we remove it for this reason?\r\nAnd if so, where shall we set it down, and be free from the difficulty?\r\nTo make sure of our object, shall we locate it nowhere, and have Congress\r\nhereafter to hold its sessions, as the loafer lodged, \"in spots about\"?\r\nI make no allusion to the present President when I say there are few\r\nstronger cases in this world of \"burden to the many and benefit to the\r\nfew,\" of \"inequality,\" than the Presidency itself is by some thought to\r\nbe. An honest laborer digs coal at about seventy cents a day, while the\r\nPresident digs abstractions at about seventy dollars a day. The coal\r\nis clearly worth more than the abstractions, and yet what a monstrous\r\ninequality in the prices! Does the President, for this reason, propose to\r\nabolish the Presidency? He does not, and he ought not. The true rule, in\r\ndetermining to embrace or reject anything, is not whether it have any evil\r\nin it, but whether it have more of evil than of good. There are few things\r\nwholly evil or wholly good. Almost everything, especially of government\r\npolicy, is an inseparable compound of the two; so that our best judgment\r\nof the preponderance between them is continually demanded. On this\r\nprinciple the President, his friends, and the world generally act on\r\nmost subjects. Why not apply it, then, upon this question? Why, as to\r\nimprovements, magnify the evil, and stoutly refuse to see any good in\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, on the third position of the message the constitutional\r\nquestion--I have not much to say. Being the man I am, and speaking, where\r\nI do, I feel that in any attempt at an original constitutional argument\r\nI should not be and ought not to be listened to patiently. The ablest and\r\nthe best of men have gone over the whole ground long ago. I shall attempt\r\nbut little more than a brief notice of what some of them have said. In\r\nrelation to Mr. Jefferson's views, I read from Mr. Polk's veto message:\r\n\r\n\"President Jefferson, in his message to Congress in 1806, recommended an\r\namendment of the Constitution, with a view to apply an anticipated surplus\r\nin the treasury 'to the great purposes of the public education, roads,\r\nrivers, canals, and such other objects of public improvement as it may\r\nbe thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of the federal\r\npowers'; and he adds: 'I suppose an amendment to the Constitution, by\r\nconsent of the States, necessary, because the objects now recommended are\r\nnot among those enumerated in the Constitution, and to which it permits\r\nthe public moneys to be applied.' In 1825, he repeated in his published\r\nletters the opinion that no such power has been conferred upon Congress.\"\r\n\r\nI introduce this not to controvert just now the constitutional opinion,\r\nbut to show that, on the question of expediency, Mr. Jefferson's opinion\r\nwas against the present President; that this opinion of Mr. Jefferson,\r\nin one branch at least, is in the hands of Mr. Polk like McFingal's\r\ngun--\"bears wide and kicks the owner over.\"\r\n\r\nBut to the constitutional question. In 1826 Chancellor Kent first\r\npublished his Commentaries on American law. He devoted a portion of one of\r\nthe lectures to the question of the authority of Congress to appropriate\r\npublic moneys for internal improvements. He mentions that the subject had\r\nnever been brought under judicial consideration, and proceeds to give a\r\nbrief summary of the discussion it had undergone between the legislative\r\nand executive branches of the government. He shows that the legislative\r\nbranch had usually been for, and the executive against, the power, till\r\nthe period of Mr. J.Q. Adams's administration, at which point he considers\r\nthe executive influence as withdrawn from opposition, and added to the\r\nsupport of the power. In 1844 the chancellor published a new edition of\r\nhis Commentaries, in which he adds some notes of what had transpired on\r\nthe question since 1826. I have not time to read the original text on\r\nthe notes; but the whole may be found on page 267, and the two or three\r\nfollowing pages, of the first volume of the edition of 1844. As to what\r\nChancellor Kent seems to consider the sum of the whole, I read from one of\r\nthe notes:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, Vol. II., pp. 429-440, and again pp. 519-538, has stated at\r\nlarge the arguments for and against the proposition that Congress have a\r\nconstitutional authority to lay taxes and to apply the power to\r\nregulate commerce as a means directly to encourage and protect domestic\r\nmanufactures; and without giving any opinion of his own on the contested\r\ndoctrine, he has left the reader to draw his own conclusions. I should\r\nthink, however, from the arguments as stated, that every mind which has\r\ntaken no part in the discussion, and felt no prejudice or territorial bias\r\non either side of the question, would deem the arguments in favor of the\r\nCongressional power vastly superior.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in this extract the power to make improvements is not\r\ndirectly mentioned; but by examining the context, both of Kent and Story,\r\nit will be seen that the power mentioned in the extract and the power to\r\nmake improvements are regarded as identical. It is not to be denied that\r\nmany great and good men have been against the power; but it is insisted\r\nthat quite as many, as great and as good, have been for it; and it is\r\nshown that, on a full survey of the whole, Chancellor Kent was of opinion\r\nthat the arguments of the latter were vastly superior. This is but the\r\nopinion of a man; but who was that man? He was one of the ablest and most\r\nlearned lawyers of his age, or of any age. It is no disparagement to\r\nMr. Polk, nor indeed to any one who devotes much time to politics, to\r\nbe placed far behind Chancellor Kent as a lawyer. His attitude was most\r\nfavorable to correct conclusions. He wrote coolly, and in retirement. He\r\nwas struggling to rear a durable monument of fame; and he well knew that\r\ntruth and thoroughly sound reasoning were the only sure foundations. Can\r\nthe party opinion of a party President on a law question, as this purely\r\nis, be at all compared or set in opposition to that of such a man, in\r\nsuch an attitude, as Chancellor Kent? This constitutional question will\r\nprobably never be better settled than it is, until it shall pass under\r\njudicial consideration; but I do think no man who is clear on the\r\nquestions of expediency need feel his conscience much pricked upon this.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, the President seems to think that enough may be done, in\r\nthe way of improvements, by means of tonnage duties under State authority,\r\nwith the consent of the General Government. Now I suppose this matter\r\nof tonnage duties is well enough in its own sphere. I suppose it may be\r\nefficient, and perhaps sufficient, to make slight improvements and repairs\r\nin harbors already in use and not much out of repair. But if I have any\r\ncorrect general idea of it, it must be wholly inefficient for any general\r\nbeneficent purposes of improvement. I know very little, or rather nothing\r\nat all, of the practical matter of levying and collecting tonnage\r\nduties; but I suppose one of its principles must be to lay a duty for the\r\nimprovement of any particular harbor upon the tonnage coming into that\r\nharbor; to do otherwise--to collect money in one harbor, to be expended\r\non improvements in another--would be an extremely aggravated form of that\r\ninequality which the President so much deprecates. If I be right in this,\r\nhow could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties?\r\nHow make a road, a canal, or clear a greatly obstructed river? The idea\r\nthat we could involves the same absurdity as the Irish bull about the new\r\nboots. \"I shall niver git 'em on,\" says Patrick, \"till I wear 'em a day\r\nor two, and stretch 'em a little.\" We shall never make a canal by tonnage\r\nduties until it shall already have been made awhile, so the tonnage can\r\nget into it.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the President concludes that possibly there may be some great\r\nobjects of improvement which cannot be effected by tonnage duties, and\r\nwhich it therefore may be expedient for the General Government to take\r\nin hand. Accordingly he suggests, in case any such be discovered, the\r\npropriety of amending the Constitution. Amend it for what? If, like\r\nMr. Jefferson, the President thought improvements expedient, but not\r\nconstitutional, it would be natural enough for him to recommend such an\r\namendment. But hear what he says in this very message:\r\n\r\n\"In view of these portentous consequences, I cannot but think that this\r\ncourse of legislation should be arrested, even were there nothing to\r\nforbid it in the fundamental laws of our Union.\"\r\n\r\nFor what, then, would he have the Constitution amended? With him it is a\r\nproposition to remove one impediment merely to be met by others which,\r\nin his opinion, cannot be removed, to enable Congress to do what, in his\r\nopinion, they ought not to do if they could.\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Meade of Virginia inquired if Mr. Lincoln understood the\r\nPresident to be opposed, on grounds of expediency, to any and every\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln answered: In the very part of his message of which I am\r\nspeaking, I understand him as giving some vague expression in favor of\r\nsome possible objects of improvement; but in doing so I understand him\r\nto be directly on the teeth of his own arguments in other parts of it.\r\nNeither the President nor any one can possibly specify an improvement\r\nwhich shall not be clearly liable to one or another of the objections he\r\nhas urged on the score of expediency. I have shown, and might show again,\r\nthat no work--no object--can be so general as to dispense its benefits\r\nwith precise equality; and this inequality is chief among the \"portentous\r\nconsequences\" for which he declares that improvements should be arrested.\r\nNo, sir. When the President intimates that something in the way of\r\nimprovements may properly be done by the General Government, he is\r\nshrinking from the conclusions to which his own arguments would force him.\r\nHe feels that the improvements of this broad and goodly land are a mighty\r\ninterest; and he is unwilling to confess to the people, or perhaps\r\nto himself, that he has built an argument which, when pressed to its\r\nconclusions, entirely annihilates this interest.\r\n\r\nI have already said that no one who is satisfied of the expediency of\r\nmaking improvements needs be much uneasy in his conscience about its\r\nconstitutionality. I wish now to submit a few remarks on the general\r\nproposition of amending the Constitution. As a general rule, I think we\r\nwould much better let it alone. No slight occasion should tempt us to\r\ntouch it. Better not take the first step, which may lead to a habit\r\nof altering it. Better, rather, habituate ourselves to think of it as\r\nunalterable. It can scarcely be made better than it is. New provisions\r\nwould introduce new difficulties, and thus create and increase appetite\r\nfor further change. No, sir; let it stand as it is. New hands have never\r\ntouched it. The men who made it have done their work, and have passed\r\naway. Who shall improve on what they did?\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, for the purpose of reviewing this message in the least\r\npossible time, as well as for the sake of distinctness, I have analyzed\r\nits arguments as well as I could, and reduced them to the propositions\r\nI have stated. I have now examined them in detail. I wish to detain the\r\ncommittee only a little while longer with some general remarks upon the\r\nsubject of improvements. That the subject is a difficult one, cannot\r\nbe denied. Still it is no more difficult in Congress than in the State\r\nLegislatures, in the counties, or in the smallest municipal districts\r\nwhich anywhere exist. All can recur to instances of this difficulty in the\r\ncase of county roads, bridges, and the like. One man is offended because\r\na road passes over his land, and another is offended because it does not\r\npass over his; one is dissatisfied because the bridge for which he is\r\ntaxed crosses the river on a different road from that which leads from his\r\nhouse to town; another cannot bear that the county should be got in debt\r\nfor these same roads and bridges; while not a few struggle hard to have\r\nroads located over their lands, and then stoutly refuse to let them be\r\nopened until they are first paid the damages. Even between the different\r\nwards and streets of towns and cities we find this same wrangling and\r\ndifficulty. Now these are no other than the very difficulties against\r\nwhich, and out of which, the President constructs his objections of\r\n\"inequality,\" \"speculation,\" and \"crushing the treasury.\" There is but a\r\nsingle alternative about them: they are sufficient, or they are not. If\r\nsufficient, they are sufficient out of Congress as well as in it, and\r\nthere is the end. We must reject them as insufficient, or lie down and do\r\nnothing by any authority. Then, difficulty though there be, let us meet\r\nand encounter it. \"Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt; nothing so\r\nhard, but search will find it out.\" Determine that the thing can and shall\r\nbe done, and then we shall find the way. The tendency to undue expansion\r\nis unquestionably the chief difficulty.\r\n\r\nHow to do something, and still not do too much, is the desideratum. Let\r\neach contribute his mite in the way of suggestion. The late Silas Wright,\r\nin a letter to the Chicago convention, contributed his, which was worth\r\nsomething; and I now contribute mine, which may be worth nothing. At all\r\nevents, it will mislead nobody, and therefore will do no harm. I would not\r\nborrow money. I am against an overwhelming, crushing system. Suppose that,\r\nat each session, Congress shall first determine how much money can, for\r\nthat year, be spared for improvements; then apportion that sum to the most\r\nimportant objects. So far all is easy; but how shall we determine which\r\nare the most important? On this question comes the collision of interests.\r\nI shall be slow to acknowledge that your harbor or your river is more\r\nimportant than mine, and vice versa. To clear this difficulty, let us\r\nhave that same statistical information which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.\r\nVinton] suggested at the beginning of this session. In that information we\r\nshall have a stern, unbending basis of facts--a basis in no wise subject\r\nto whim, caprice, or local interest. The prelimited amount of means will\r\nsave us from doing too much, and the statistics will save us from doing\r\nwhat we do in wrong places. Adopt and adhere to this course, and, it seems\r\nto me, the difficulty is cleared.\r\n\r\nOne of the gentlemen from South Carolina [Mr. Rhett] very much deprecates\r\nthese statistics. He particularly objects, as I understand him, to\r\ncounting all the pigs and chickens in the land. I do not perceive much\r\nforce in the objection. It is true that if everything be enumerated, a\r\nportion of such statistics may not be very useful to this object. Such\r\nproducts of the country as are to be consumed where they are produced need\r\nno roads or rivers, no means of transportation, and have no very proper\r\nconnection with this subject. The surplus--that which is produced in\r\none place to be consumed in another; the capacity of each locality for\r\nproducing a greater surplus; the natural means of transportation, and\r\ntheir susceptibility of improvement; the hindrances, delays, and losses of\r\nlife and property during transportation, and the causes of each, would be\r\namong the most valuable statistics in this connection. From these it would\r\nreadily appear where a given amount of expenditure would do the most good.\r\nThese statistics might be equally accessible, as they would be equally\r\nuseful, to both the nation and the States. In this way, and by these\r\nmeans, let the nation take hold of the larger works, and the States the\r\nsmaller ones; and thus, working in a meeting direction, discreetly, but\r\nsteadily and firmly, what is made unequal in one place may be equalized in\r\nanother, extravagance avoided, and the whole country put on that career\r\nof prosperity which shall correspond with its extent of territory, its\r\nnatural resources, and the intelligence and enterprise of its people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG POLITICIANS\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 22, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Last night I was attending a sort of caucus of the Whig\r\nmembers, held in relation to the coming Presidential election. The whole\r\nfield of the nation was scanned, and all is high hope and confidence.\r\nIllinois is expected to better her condition in this race. Under these\r\ncircumstances, judge how heartrending it was to come to my room and find\r\nand read your discouraging letter of the 15th. We have made no gains, but\r\nhave lost \"H. R. Robinson, Turner, Campbell, and four or five more.\"\r\nTell Arney to reconsider, if he would be saved. Baker and I used to do\r\nsomething, but I think you attach more importance to our absence than is\r\njust. There is another cause. In 1840, for instance, we had two senators\r\nand five representatives in Sangamon; now we have part of one senator and\r\ntwo representatives. With quite one third more people than we had then, we\r\nhave only half the sort of offices which are sought by men of the speaking\r\nsort of talent. This, I think, is the chief cause. Now, as to the young\r\nmen. You must not wait to be brought forward by the older men. For\r\ninstance, do you suppose that I should ever have got into notice if I had\r\nwaited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men? You young men get\r\ntogether and form a \"Rough and Ready Club,\" and have regular meetings and\r\nspeeches. Take in everybody you can get. Harrison Grimsley, L. A. Enos,\r\nLee Kimball, and C. W. Matheny will do to begin the thing; but as you go\r\nalong gather up all the shrewd, wild boys about town, whether just of age,\r\nor a little under age, Chris. Logan, Reddick Ridgely, Lewis Zwizler, and\r\nhundreds such. Let every one play the part he can play best,--some speak,\r\nsome sing, and all \"holler.\" Your meetings will be of evenings; the\r\nolder men, and the women, will go to hear you; so that it will not only\r\ncontribute to the election of \"Old Zach,\" but will be an interesting\r\npastime, and improving to the intellectual faculties of all engaged. Don't\r\nfail to do this.\r\n\r\nYou ask me to send you all the speeches made about \"Old Zach,\" the war,\r\netc. Now this makes me a little impatient. I have regularly sent you the\r\nCongressional Globe and Appendix, and you cannot have examined them, or\r\nyou would have discovered that they contain every speech made by every man\r\nin both houses of Congress, on every subject, during the session. Can I\r\nsend any more? Can I send speeches that nobody has made? Thinking it would\r\nbe most natural that the newspapers would feel interested to give at least\r\nsome of the speeches to their readers, I at the beginning of the session\r\nmade arrangements to have one copy of the Globe and Appendix regularly\r\nsent to each Whig paper of the district. And yet, with the exception of my\r\nown little speech, which was published in two only of the then five, now\r\nfour, Whig papers, I do not remember having seen a single speech, or even\r\nextract from one, in any single one of those papers. With equal and full\r\nmeans on both sides, I will venture that the State Register has thrown\r\nbefore its readers more of Locofoco speeches in a month than all the Whig\r\npapers of the district have done of Whig speeches during the session.\r\n\r\nIf you wish a full understanding of the war, I repeat what I believe I\r\nsaid to you in a letter once before, that the whole, or nearly so, is\r\nto be found in the speech of Dixon of Connecticut. This I sent you in\r\npamphlet as well as in the Globe. Examine and study every sentence of that\r\nspeech thoroughly, and you will understand the whole subject. You ask how\r\nCongress came to declare that war had existed by the act of Mexico. Is it\r\npossible you don't understand that yet? You have at least twenty speeches\r\nin your possession that fully explain it. I will, however, try it once\r\nmore. The news reached Washington of the commencement of hostilities\r\non the Rio Grande, and of the great peril of General Taylor's army.\r\nEverybody, Whigs and Democrats, was for sending them aid, in men and\r\nmoney. It was necessary to pass a bill for this. The Locos had a majority\r\nin both houses, and they brought in a bill with a preamble saying:\r\nWhereas, War exists by the act of Mexico, therefore we send General Taylor\r\nmoney. The Whigs moved to strike out the preamble, so that they could\r\nvote to send the men and money, without saying anything about how the\r\nwar commenced; but being in the minority, they were voted down, and the\r\npreamble was retained. Then, on the passage of the bill, the question came\r\nupon them, Shall we vote for preamble and bill together, or against\r\nboth together? They did not want to vote against sending help to\r\nGeneral Taylor, and therefore they voted for both together. Is there any\r\ndifficulty in understanding this? Even my little speech shows how this\r\nwas; and if you will go to the library, you may get the Journal of\r\n1845-46, in which you will find the whole for yourself.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing published yet with special reference to the Taylor race;\r\nbut we soon will have, and then I will send them to everybody. I made an\r\ninternal-improvement speech day before yesterday, which I shall send home\r\nas soon as I can get it written out and printed,--and which I suppose\r\nnobody will read.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALARY OF JUDGE IN WESTERN VIRGINIA\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JUNE 28, 1848.\r\n\r\nDiscussion as to salary of judge of western Virginia:--Wishing to increase\r\nit from $1800 to $2500.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said he felt unwilling to be either unjust or ungenerous,\r\nand he wanted to understand the real case of this judicial officer. The\r\ngentleman from Virginia had stated that he had to hold eleven courts. Now\r\neverybody knew that it was not the habit of the district judges of the\r\nUnited States in other States to hold anything like that number of\r\ncourts; and he therefore took it for granted that this must happen under a\r\npeculiar law which required that large number of courts to be holden every\r\nyear; and these laws, he further supposed, were passed at the request of\r\nthe people of that judicial district. It came, then, to this: that the\r\npeople in the western district of Virginia had got eleven courts to be\r\nheld among them in one year, for their own accommodation; and being thus\r\nbetter accommodated than neighbors elsewhere, they wanted their judge\r\nto be a little better paid. In Illinois there had been until the present\r\nseason but one district court held in the year. There were now to be two.\r\nCould it be that the western district of Virginia furnished more business\r\nfor a judge than the whole State of Illinois?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL BANK\r\n\r\nJULY, 1848,\r\n\r\n[FRAGMENT]\r\n\r\nThe question of a national bank is at rest. Were I President, I should not\r\nurge its reagitation upon Congress; but should Congress see fit to pass an\r\nact to establish such an institution, I should not arrest it by the veto,\r\nunless I should consider it subject to some constitutional objection from\r\nwhich I believe the two former banks to have been free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG v.s. OLD--POLITICAL JEALOUSY\r\n\r\nTO W. H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 10, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:\r\n\r\nYour letter covering the newspaper slips was received last night. The\r\nsubject of that letter is exceedingly painful to me, and I cannot but\r\nthink there is some mistake in your impression of the motives of the old\r\nmen. I suppose I am now one of the old men; and I declare on my veracity,\r\nwhich I think is good with you, that nothing could afford me more\r\nsatisfaction than to learn that you and others of my young friends at home\r\nwere doing battle in the contest and endearing themselves to the people\r\nand taking a stand far above any I have ever been able to reach in their\r\nadmiration. I cannot conceive that other men feel differently. Of course\r\nI cannot demonstrate what I say; but I was young once, and I am sure I was\r\nnever ungenerously thrust back. I hardly know what to say. The way for a\r\nyoung man to rise is to improve himself every way he can, never suspecting\r\nthat anybody wishes to hinder him. Allow me to assure you that suspicion\r\nand jealousy never did help any man in any situation. There may sometimes\r\nbe ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down; and they will succeed,\r\ntoo, if he allows his mind to be diverted from its true channel to brood\r\nover the attempted injury. Cast about and see if this feeling has not\r\ninjured every person you have ever known to fall into it.\r\n\r\nNow, in what I have said I am sure you will suspect nothing but sincere\r\nfriendship. I would save you from a fatal error. You have been a studious\r\nyoung man. You are far better informed on almost all subjects than I ever\r\nhave been. You cannot fail in any laudable object unless you allow your\r\nmind to be improperly directed. I have some the advantage of you in the\r\nworld's experience, merely by being older; and it is this that induces me\r\nto advise. You still seem to be a little mistaken about the Congressional\r\nGlobe and Appendix. They contain all of the speeches that are published in\r\nany way. My speech and Dayton's speech which you say you got in pamphlet\r\nform are both word for word in the Appendix. I repeat again, all are\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL TAYLOR AND THE VETO\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JULY 27, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. SPEAKER, our Democratic friends seem to be in a great distress because\r\nthey think our candidate for the Presidency don't suit us. Most of them\r\ncannot find out that General Taylor has any principles at all; some,\r\nhowever, have discovered that he has one, but that one is entirely wrong.\r\nThis one principle is his position on the veto power. The gentleman from\r\nTennessee [Mr. Stanton] who has just taken his seat, indeed, has said\r\nthere is very little, if any, difference on this question between General\r\nTaylor and all the Presidents; and he seems to think it sufficient\r\ndetraction from General Taylor's position on it that it has nothing new\r\nin it. But all others whom I have heard speak assail it furiously. A new\r\nmember from Kentucky [Mr. Clark], of very considerable ability, was\r\nin particular concerned about it. He thought it altogether novel and\r\nunprecedented for a President or a Presidential candidate to think of\r\napproving bills whose constitutionality may not be entirely clear to his\r\nown mind. He thinks the ark of our safety is gone unless Presidents\r\nshall always veto such bills as in their judgment may be of doubtful\r\nconstitutionality. However clear Congress may be on their authority to\r\npass any particular act, the gentleman from Kentucky thinks the President\r\nmust veto it if he has doubts about it. Now I have neither time nor\r\ninclination to argue with the gentleman on the veto power as an original\r\nquestion; but I wish to show that General Taylor, and not he, agrees with\r\nthe earlier statesmen on this question. When the bill chartering the\r\nfirst Bank of the United States passed Congress, its constitutionality was\r\nquestioned. Mr. Madison, then in the House of Representatives, as well as\r\nothers, had opposed it on that ground. General Washington, as President,\r\nwas called on to approve or reject it. He sought and obtained on the\r\nconstitutionality question the separate written opinions of Jefferson,\r\nHamilton, and Edmund Randolph,--they then being respectively Secretary of\r\nState, Secretary of the Treasury, and Attorney general. Hamilton's opinion\r\nwas for the power; while Randolph's and Jefferson's were both against\r\nit. Mr. Jefferson, after giving his opinion deciding only against the\r\nconstitutionality of the bill, closes his letter with the paragraph which\r\nI now read:\r\n\r\n\"It must be admitted, however, that unless the President's mind, on a view\r\nof everything which is urged for and against this bill, is tolerably clear\r\nthat it is unauthorized by the Constitution,--if the pro and con hang\r\nso even as to balance his judgment, a just respect for the wisdom of the\r\nlegislature would naturally decide the balance in favor of their opinion.\r\nIt is chiefly for cases where they are clearly misled by error, ambition,\r\nor interest, that the Constitution has placed a check in the negative of\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\"February 15, 1791.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor's opinion, as expressed in his Allison letter, is as I now\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\"The power given by the veto is a high conservative power; but, in my\r\nopinion, should never be exercised except in cases of clear violation\r\nof the Constitution, or manifest haste and want of consideration by\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\nIt is here seen that, in Mr. Jefferson's opinion, if on the\r\nconstitutionality of any given bill the President doubts, he is not to\r\nveto it, as the gentleman from Kentucky would have him do, but is to defer\r\nto Congress and approve it. And if we compare the opinion of Jefferson and\r\nTaylor, as expressed in these paragraphs, we shall find them more exactly\r\nalike than we can often find any two expressions having any literal\r\ndifference. None but interested faultfinders, I think, can discover any\r\nsubstantial variation.\r\n\r\nBut gentlemen on the other side are unanimously agreed that General Taylor\r\nhas no other principles. They are in utter darkness as to his opinions on\r\nany of the questions of policy which occupy the public attention. But\r\nis there any doubt as to what he will do on the prominent questions if\r\nelected? Not the least. It is not possible to know what he will or would\r\ndo in every imaginable case, because many questions have passed away, and\r\nothers doubtless will arise which none of us have yet thought of; but on\r\nthe prominent questions of currency, tariff, internal improvements, and\r\nWilmot Proviso, General Taylor's course is at least as well defined as is\r\nGeneral Cass's. Why, in their eagerness to get at General Taylor, several\r\nDemocratic members here have desired to know whether, in case of his\r\nelection, a bankrupt law is to be established. Can they tell us General\r\nCass's opinion on this question?\r\n\r\n[Some member answered, \"He is against it.\"]\r\n\r\nAye, how do you know he is? There is nothing about it in the platform, nor\r\nelsewhere, that I have seen. If the gentleman knows of anything which I\r\ndo not know he can show it. But to return. General Taylor, in his Allison\r\nletter, says:\r\n\r\n\"Upon the subject of the tariff, the currency, the improvement of our\r\ngreat highways, rivers, lakes, and harbors, the will of the people, as\r\nexpressed through their representatives in Congress, ought to be respected\r\nand carried out by the executive.\"\r\n\r\nNow this is the whole matter. In substance, it is this: The people say to\r\nGeneral Taylor, \"If you are elected, shall we have a national bank?\" He\r\nanswers, \"Your will, gentlemen, not mine.\" \"What about the tariff?\" \"Say\r\nyourselves.\" \"Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?\" \"Just as you\r\nplease. If you desire a bank, an alteration of the tariff, internal\r\nimprovements, any or all, I will not hinder you. If you do not desire\r\nthem, I will not attempt to force them on you. Send up your members of\r\nCongress from the various districts, with opinions according to your own,\r\nand if they are for these measures, or any of them, I shall have nothing\r\nto oppose; if they are not for them, I shall not, by any appliances\r\nwhatever, attempt to dragoon them into their adoption.\"\r\n\r\nNow can there be any difficulty in understanding this? To you Democrats\r\nit may not seem like principle; but surely you cannot fail to perceive the\r\nposition plainly enough. The distinction between it and the position of\r\nyour candidate is broad and obvious, and I admit you have a clear right to\r\nshow it is wrong if you can; but you have no right to pretend you cannot\r\nsee it at all. We see it, and to us it appears like principle, and the\r\nbest sort of principle at that--the principle of allowing the people to\r\ndo as they please with their own business. My friend from Indiana (C. B.\r\nSmith) has aptly asked, \"Are you willing to trust the people?\" Some of\r\nyou answered substantially, \"We are willing to trust the people; but the\r\nPresident is as much the representative of the people as Congress.\" In a\r\ncertain sense, and to a certain extent, he is the representative of the\r\npeople. He is elected by them, as well as Congress is; but can he, in the\r\nnature of things know the wants of the people as well as three hundred\r\nother men, coming from all the various localities of the nation? If so,\r\nwhere is the propriety of having a Congress? That the Constitution gives\r\nthe President a negative on legislation, all know; but that this negative\r\nshould be so combined with platforms and other appliances as to enable\r\nhim, and in fact almost compel him, to take the whole of legislation into\r\nhis own hands, is what we object to, is what General Taylor objects to,\r\nand is what constitutes the broad distinction between you and us. To thus\r\ntransfer legislation is clearly to take it from those who understand with\r\nminuteness the interests of the people, and give it to one who does\r\nnot and cannot so well understand it. I understand your idea that if a\r\nPresidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given question, or rather\r\nupon all questions, and the people, with full knowledge of this, elect\r\nhim, they thereby distinctly approve all those opinions. By means of it,\r\nmeasures are adopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of\r\none party, and often nearly half of the other. Three, four, or half a\r\ndozen questions are prominent at a given time; the party selects its\r\ncandidate, and he takes his position on each of these questions. On all\r\nbut one his positions have already been indorsed at former elections,\r\nand his party fully committed to them; but that one is new, and a large\r\nportion of them are against it. But what are they to do? The whole was\r\nstrung together; and they must take all, or reject all. They cannot take\r\nwhat they like, and leave the rest. What they are already committed\r\nto being the majority, they shut their eyes, and gulp the whole. Next\r\nelection, still another is introduced in the same way. If we run our eyes\r\nalong the line of the past, we shall see that almost if not quite all the\r\narticles of the present Democratic creed have been at first forced upon\r\nthe party in this very way. And just now, and just so, opposition to\r\ninternal improvements is to be established if General Cass shall be\r\nelected. Almost half the Democrats here are for improvements; but they\r\nwill vote for Cass, and if he succeeds, their vote will have aided in\r\nclosing the doors against improvements. Now this is a process which we\r\nthink is wrong. We prefer a candidate who, like General Taylor, will allow\r\nthe people to have their own way, regardless of his private opinions;\r\nand I should think the internal-improvement Democrats, at least, ought to\r\nprefer such a candidate. He would force nothing on them which they\r\ndon't want, and he would allow them to have improvements which their own\r\ncandidate, if elected, will not.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, I have said General Taylor's position is as well defined as\r\nis that of General Cass. In saying this, I admit I do not certainly know\r\nwhat he would do on the Wilmot Proviso. I am a Northern man or rather\r\na Western Free-State man, with a constituency I believe to be, and with\r\npersonal feelings I know to be, against the extension of slavery. As such,\r\nand with what information I have, I hope and believe General Taylor, if\r\nelected, would not veto the proviso. But I do not know it. Yet if I\r\nknew he would, I still would vote for him. I should do so because, in my\r\njudgment, his election alone can defeat General Cass; and because,\r\nshould slavery thereby go to the territory we now have, just so much will\r\ncertainly happen by the election of Cass, and in addition a course of\r\npolicy leading to new wars, new acquisitions of territory and still\r\nfurther extensions of slavery. One of the two is to be President. Which is\r\npreferable?\r\n\r\nBut there is as much doubt of Cass on improvements as there is of Taylor\r\non the proviso. I have no doubt myself of General Cass on this question;\r\nbut I know the Democrats differ among themselves as to his position. My\r\ninternal-improvement colleague [Mr. Wentworth] stated on this floor the\r\nother day that he was satisfied Cass was for improvements, because he had\r\nvoted for all the bills that he [Mr. Wentworth] had. So far so good. But\r\nMr. Polk vetoed some of these very bills. The Baltimore convention passed\r\na set of resolutions, among other things, approving these vetoes, and\r\nGeneral Cass declares, in his letter accepting the nomination, that he has\r\ncarefully read these resolutions, and that he adheres to them as firmly\r\nas he approves them cordially. In other words, General Cass voted for the\r\nbills, and thinks the President did right to veto them; and his friends\r\nhere are amiable enough to consider him as being on one side or the\r\nother, just as one or the other may correspond with their own respective\r\ninclinations. My colleague admits that the platform declares against the\r\nconstitutionality of a general system of improvements, and that General\r\nCass indorses the platform; but he still thinks General Cass is in favor\r\nof some sort of improvements. Well, what are they? As he is against\r\ngeneral objects, those he is for must be particular and local. Now this is\r\ntaking the subject precisely by the wrong end. Particularity expending the\r\nmoney of the whole people for an object which will benefit only a portion\r\nof them--is the greatest real objection to improvements, and has been so\r\nheld by General Jackson, Mr. Polk, and all others, I believe, till\r\nnow. But now, behold, the objects most general--nearest free from this\r\nobjection--are to be rejected, while those most liable to it are to be\r\nembraced. To return: I cannot help believing that General Cass, when he\r\nwrote his letter of acceptance, well understood he was to be claimed by\r\nthe advocates of both sides of this question, and that he then closed the\r\ndoor against all further expressions of opinion purposely to retain\r\nthe benefits of that double position. His subsequent equivocation at\r\nCleveland, to my mind, proves such to have been the case.\r\n\r\nOne word more, and I shall have done with this branch of the subject. You\r\nDemocrats, and your candidate, in the main are in favor of laying down\r\nin advance a platform--a set of party positions--as a unit, and then of\r\nforcing the people, by every sort of appliance, to ratify them, however\r\nunpalatable some of them may be. We and our candidate are in favor of\r\nmaking Presidential elections and the legislation of the country distinct\r\nmatters; so that the people can elect whom they please, and afterward\r\nlegislate just as they please, without any hindrance, save only so much as\r\nmay guard against infractions of the Constitution, undue haste, and want\r\nof consideration. The difference between us is clear as noonday. That\r\nwe are right we cannot doubt. We hold the true Republican position. In\r\nleaving the people's business in their hands, we cannot be wrong. We are\r\nwilling, and even anxious, to go to the people on this issue.\r\n\r\nBut I suppose I cannot reasonably hope to convince you that we have any\r\nprinciples. The most I can expect is to assure you that we think we have\r\nand are quite contented with them. The other day one of the gentlemen from\r\nGeorgia [Mr. Iverson], an eloquent man, and a man of learning, so far as\r\nI can judge, not being learned myself, came down upon us astonishingly. He\r\nspoke in what the 'Baltimore American' calls the \"scathing and withering\r\nstyle.\" At the end of his second severe flash I was struck blind, and\r\nfound myself feeling with my fingers for an assurance of my continued\r\nexistence. A little of the bone was left, and I gradually revived. He\r\neulogized Mr. Clay in high and beautiful terms, and then declared that we\r\nhad deserted all our principles, and had turned Henry Clay out, like an\r\nold horse, to root. This is terribly severe. It cannot be answered\r\nby argument--at least I cannot so answer it. I merely wish to ask the\r\ngentleman if the Whigs are the only party he can think of who sometimes\r\nturn old horses out to root. Is not a certain Martin Van Buren an old\r\nhorse which your own party have turned out to root? and is he not rooting\r\na little to your discomfort about now? But in not nominating Mr. Clay\r\nwe deserted our principles, you say. Ah! In what? Tell us, ye men of\r\nprinciple, what principle we violated. We say you did violate principle in\r\ndiscarding Van Buren, and we can tell you how. You violated the\r\nprimary, the cardinal, the one great living principle of all democratic\r\nrepresentative government--the principle that the representative is bound\r\nto carry out the known will of his constituents. A large majority of the\r\nBaltimore convention of 1844 were, by their constituents, instructed to\r\nprocure Van Buren 's nomination if they could. In violation--in utter\r\nglaring contempt of this, you rejected him; rejected him, as the gentleman\r\nfrom New York [Mr. Birdsall] the other day expressly admitted, for\r\navailability--that same \"general availability\" which you charge upon\r\nus, and daily chew over here, as something exceedingly odious and\r\nunprincipled. But the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Iverson] gave us a\r\nsecond speech yesterday, all well considered and put down in writing, in\r\nwhich Van Buren was scathed and withered a \"few\" for his present position\r\nand movements. I cannot remember the gentleman's precise language; but\r\nI do remember he put Van Buren down, down, till he got him where he was\r\nfinally to \"stink\" and \"rot.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, it is no business or inclination of mine to defend Martin\r\nVan Buren in the war of extermination now waging between him and his old\r\nadmirers. I say, \"Devil take the hindmost\"--and the foremost. But there is\r\nno mistaking the origin of the breach; and if the curse of \"stinking\" and\r\n\"rotting\" is to fall on the first and greatest violators of principle in\r\nthe matter, I disinterestedly suggest that the gentleman from Georgia\r\nand his present co-workers are bound to take it upon themselves. But the\r\ngentleman from Georgia further says we have deserted all our principles,\r\nand taken shelter under General Taylor's military coat-tail, and he seems\r\nto think this is exceedingly degrading. Well, as his faith is, so be it\r\nunto him. But can he remember no other military coat-tail under which a\r\ncertain other party have been sheltering for near a quarter of a century?\r\nHas he no acquaintance with the ample military coat tail of General\r\nJackson? Does he not know that his own party have run the five last\r\nPresidential races under that coat-tail, and that they are now running the\r\nsixth under the same cover? Yes, sir, that coat-tail was used not only for\r\nGeneral Jackson himself, but has been clung to, with the grip of death,\r\nby every Democratic candidate since. You have never ventured, and dare not\r\nnow venture, from under it. Your campaign papers have constantly been \"Old\r\nHickories,\" with rude likenesses of the old general upon them; hickory\r\npoles and hickory brooms your never-ending emblems; Mr. Polk himself was\r\n\"Young Hickory,\" or something so; and even now your campaign paper here\r\nis proclaiming that Cass and Butler are of the true \"Hickory stripe.\" Now,\r\nsir, you dare not give it up. Like a horde of hungry ticks you have stuck\r\nto the tail of the Hermitage Lion to the end of his life; and you are\r\nstill sticking to it, and drawing a loathsome sustenance from it, after he\r\nis dead. A fellow once advertised that he had made a discovery by which he\r\ncould make a new man out of an old one, and have enough of the stuff left\r\nto make a little yellow dog. Just such a discovery has General Jackson's\r\npopularity been to you. You not only twice made President of him out\r\nof it, but you have had enough of the stuff left to make Presidents of\r\nseveral comparatively small men since; and it is your chief reliance now\r\nto make still another.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, old horses and military coat-tails, or tails of any sort,\r\nare not figures of speech such as I would be the first to introduce into\r\ndiscussions here; but as the gentleman from Georgia has thought fit to\r\nintroduce them, he and you are welcome to all you have made, or can make\r\nby them. If you have any more old horses, trot them out; any more tails,\r\njust cock them and come at us. I repeat, I would not introduce this mode\r\nof discussion here; but I wish gentlemen on the other side to understand\r\nthat the use of degrading figures is a game at which they may not find\r\nthemselves able to take all the winnings.\r\n\r\n[\"We give it up!\"]\r\n\r\nAye, you give it up, and well you may; but for a very different reason\r\nfrom that which you would have us understand. The point--the power to\r\nhurt--of all figures consists in the truthfulness of their application;\r\nand, understanding this, you may well give it up. They are weapons which\r\nhit you, but miss us.\r\n\r\nBut in my hurry I was very near closing this subject of military tails\r\nbefore I was done with it. There is one entire article of the sort I have\r\nnot discussed yet,--I mean the military tail you Democrats are now engaged\r\nin dovetailing into the great Michigander [Cass]. Yes, sir; all his\r\nbiographies (and they are legion) have him in hand, tying him to a\r\nmilitary tail, like so many mischievous boys tying a dog to a bladder of\r\nbeans. True, the material they have is very limited, but they drive at it\r\nmight and main. He invaded Canada without resistance, and he outvaded it\r\nwithout pursuit. As he did both under orders, I suppose there was to him\r\nneither credit nor discredit in them; but they constitute a large part\r\nof the tail. He was not at Hull's surrender, but he was close by; he was\r\nvolunteer aid to General Harrison on the day of the battle of the Thames;\r\nand as you said in 1840 Harrison was picking huckleberries two miles off\r\nwhile the battle was fought, I suppose it is a just conclusion with you\r\nto say Cass was aiding Harrison to pick huckleberries. This is about all,\r\nexcept the mooted question of the broken sword. Some authors say he broke\r\nit, some say he threw it away, and some others, who ought to know, say\r\nnothing about it. Perhaps it would be a fair historical compromise to say,\r\nif he did not break it, he did not do anything else with it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Mr. Speaker, did you know I am a military hero? Yes, sir; in\r\nthe days of the Black Hawk war I fought, bled, and came away. Speaking\r\nof General Cass's career reminds me of my own. I was not at Stiliman's\r\ndefeat, but I was about as near it as Cass was to Hull's surrender; and,\r\nlike him, I saw the place very soon afterward. It is quite certain I did\r\nnot break my sword, for I had none to break; but I bent a musket pretty\r\nbadly on one occasion. If Cass broke his sword, the idea is he broke it\r\nin desperation; I bent the musket by accident. If General Cass went in\r\nadvance of me in picking huckleberries, I guess I surpassed him in charges\r\nupon the wild onions. If he saw any live, fighting Indians, it was more\r\nthan I did; but I had a good many bloody struggles with the mosquitoes,\r\nand although I never fainted from the loss of blood, I can truly say I was\r\noften very hungry. Mr. Speaker, if I should ever conclude to doff whatever\r\nour Democratic friends may suppose there is of black-cockade federalism\r\nabout me, and therefore they shall take me up as their candidate for\r\nthe Presidency, I protest they shall not make fun of me, as they have of\r\nGeneral Cass, by attempting to write me into a military hero.\r\n\r\nWhile I have General Cass in hand, I wish to say a word about his\r\npolitical principles. As a specimen, I take the record of his progress in\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso. In the Washington Union of March 2, 1847, there is a\r\nreport of a speech of General Cass, made the day before in the Senate, on\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso, during the delivery of which Mr. Miller of New Jersey\r\nis reported to have interrupted him as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Miller expressed his great surprise at the change in the sentiments\r\nof the Senator from Michigan, who had been regarded as the great champion\r\nof freedom in the Northwest, of which he was a distinguished ornament.\r\nLast year the Senator from Michigan was understood to be decidedly in\r\nfavor of the Wilmot Proviso; and as no reason had been stated for the\r\nchange, he [Mr. Miller] could not refrain from the expression of his\r\nextreme surprise.\"\r\n\r\nTo this General Cass is reported to have replied as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cass said that the course of the Senator from New Jersey was\r\nmost extraordinary. Last year he [Mr. Cass] should have voted for the\r\nproposition, had it come up. But circumstances had altogether changed. The\r\nhonorable Senator then read several passages from the remarks, as given\r\nabove, which he had committed to writing, in order to refute such a charge\r\nas that of the Senator from New Jersey.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"remarks above reduced to writing\" is one numbered four, as\r\nfollows, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"Fourth. Legislation now would be wholly inoperative, because no territory\r\nhereafter to be acquired can be governed without an act of Congress\r\nproviding for its government; and such an act, on its passage, would open\r\nthe whole subject, and leave the Congress called on to pass it free to\r\nexercise its own discretion, entirely uncontrolled by any declaration\r\nfound on the statute-book.\"\r\n\r\nIn Niles's Register, vol. lxxiii., p. 293, there is a letter of General\r\nCass to ------ Nicholson, of Nashville, Tennessee, dated December 24, 1847,\r\nfrom which the following are correct extracts:\r\n\r\n\"The Wilmot Proviso has been before the country some time. It has been\r\nrepeatedly discussed in Congress and by the public press. I am strongly\r\nimpressed with the opinion that a great change has been going on in the\r\npublic mind upon this subject,--in my own as well as others',--and that\r\ndoubts are resolving themselves into convictions that the principle it\r\ninvolves should be kept out of the national legislature, and left to\r\nthe people of the confederacy in their respective local governments....\r\nBriefly, then, I am opposed to the exercise of any jurisdiction by\r\nCongress over this matter; and I am in favor of leaving the people of\r\nany territory which may be hereafter acquired the right to regulate\r\nit themselves, under the general principles of the Constitution.\r\nBecause--'First. I do not see in the Constitution any grant of the\r\nrequisite power to Congress; and I am not disposed to extend a doubtful\r\nprecedent beyond its necessity,--the establishment of territorial\r\ngovernments when needed,--leaving to the inhabitants all the right\r\ncompatible with the relations they bear to the confederation.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts show that in 1846 General Cass was for the proviso at once;\r\nthat in March, 1847, he was still for it, but not just then; and that in\r\nDecember, 1847, he was against it altogether. This is a true index to the\r\nwhole man. When the question was raised in 1846, he was in a blustering\r\nhurry to take ground for it. He sought to be in advance, and to avoid\r\nthe uninteresting position of a mere follower; but soon he began to see\r\nglimpses of the great Democratic ox-goad waving in his face, and to hear\r\nindistinctly a voice saying, \"Back! Back, sir! Back a little!\" He shakes\r\nhis head, and bats his eyes, and blunders back to his position of March,\r\n1847; but still the goad waves, and the voice grows more distinct and\r\nsharper still, \"Back, sir! Back, I say! Further back!\"--and back he goes\r\nto the position of December, 1847, at which the goad is still, and the\r\nvoice soothingly says, \"So! Stand at that!\"\r\n\r\nHave no fears, gentlemen, of your candidate. He exactly suits you, and\r\nwe congratulate you upon it. However much you may be distressed about our\r\ncandidate, you have all cause to be contented and happy with your own. If\r\nelected, he may not maintain all or even any of his positions previously\r\ntaken; but he will be sure to do whatever the party exigency for the time\r\nbeing may require; and that is precisely what you want. He and Van Buren\r\nare the same \"manner of men\"; and, like Van Buren, he will never desert\r\nyou till you first desert him.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, I adopt the suggestion of a friend, that General Cass is a\r\ngeneral of splendidly successful charges--charges, to be sure, not\r\nupon the public enemy, but upon the public treasury. He was Governor of\r\nMichigan territory, and ex-officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\r\nfrom the 9th of October, 1813, till the 31st of July, 1831--a period of\r\nseventeen years, nine months, and twenty-two days. During this period\r\nhe received from the United States treasury, for personal services and\r\npersonal expenses, the aggregate sum of ninety-six thousand and twenty\r\neight dollars, being an average of fourteen dollars and seventy-nine cents\r\nper day for every day of the time. This large sum was reached by assuming\r\nthat he was doing service at several different places, and in several\r\ndifferent capacities in the same place, all at the same time. By a correct\r\nanalysis of his accounts during that period, the following propositions\r\nmay be deduced:\r\n\r\nFirst. He was paid in three different capacities during the whole of the\r\ntime: that is to say--(1) As governor a salary at the rate per year\r\nof $2000. (2) As estimated for office rent, clerk hire, fuel, etc., in\r\nsuperintendence of Indian affairs in Michigan, at the rate per year of\r\n$1500. (3) As compensation and expenses for various miscellaneous items of\r\nIndian service out of Michigan, an average per year of $625.\r\n\r\nSecond. During part of the time--that is, from the 9th of October, 1813,\r\nto the 29th of May, 1822 he was paid in four different capacities; that is\r\nto say, the three as above, and, in addition thereto, the commutation of\r\nten rations per day, amounting per year to $730.\r\n\r\nThird. During another part of the time--that is, from the beginning\r\nof 1822 to the 31st of July, '83 he was also paid in four different\r\ncapacities; that is to say, the first three, as above (the rations being\r\ndropped after the 29th of May, 1822), and, in addition thereto, for\r\nsuperintending Indian Agencies at Piqua, Ohio; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and\r\nChicago, Illinois, at the rate per year of $1500. It should be observed\r\nhere that the last item, commencing at the beginning of 1822, and the item\r\nof rations, ending on the 29th of May, 1822, lap on each other during so\r\nmuch of the time as lies between those two dates.\r\n\r\nFourth. Still another part of the time--that is, from the 31st of October,\r\n1821, to the 29th of May, 1822--he was paid in six different capacities;\r\nthat is to say, the three first, as above; the item of rations, as above;\r\nand, in addition thereto, another item of ten rations per day while at\r\nWashington settling his accounts, being at the rate per year of $730; and\r\nalso an allowance for expenses traveling to and from Washington, and while\r\nthere, of $1022, being at the rate per year of $1793.\r\n\r\nFifth. And yet during the little portion of the time which lies between\r\nthe 1st of January, 1822, and the 29th of May, 1822, he was paid in seven\r\ndifferent capacities; that is to say, the six last mentioned, and also,\r\nat the rate of $1500 per year, for the Piqua, Fort Wayne, and Chicago\r\nservice, as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThese accounts have already been discussed some here; but when we are\r\namongst them, as when we are in the Patent Office, we must peep about a\r\ngood deal before we can see all the curiosities. I shall not be tedious\r\nwith them. As to the large item of $1500 per year--amounting in the\r\naggregate to $26,715 for office rent, clerk hire, fuel, etc., I barely\r\nwish to remark that, so far as I can discover in the public documents,\r\nthere is no evidence, by word or inference, either from any disinterested\r\nwitness or of General Cass himself, that he ever rented or kept a separate\r\noffice, ever hired or kept a clerk, or even used any extra amount of fuel,\r\netc., in consequence of his Indian services. Indeed, General Cass's entire\r\nsilence in regard to these items, in his two long letters urging his\r\nclaims upon the government, is, to my mind, almost conclusive that no such\r\nclaims had any real existence.\r\n\r\nBut I have introduced General Cass's accounts here chiefly to show the\r\nwonderful physical capacities of the man. They show that he not only did\r\nthe labor of several men at the same time, but that he often did it at\r\nseveral places, many hundreds of miles apart, at the same time. And at\r\neating, too, his capacities are shown to be quite as wonderful. From\r\nOctober, 1821, to May, 1822, he eat ten rations a day in Michigan, ten\r\nrations a day here in Washington, and near five dollars' worth a day on\r\nthe road between the two places! And then there is an important discovery\r\nin his example--the art of being paid for what one eats, instead of having\r\nto pay for it. Hereafter if any nice young man should owe a bill which\r\nhe cannot pay in any other way, he can just board it out. Mr. Speaker, we\r\nhave all heard of the animal standing in doubt between two stacks of hay\r\nand starving to death. The like of that would never happen to General\r\nCass. Place the stacks a thousand miles apart, he would stand stock-still\r\nmidway between them, and eat them both at once, and the green grass along\r\nthe line would be apt to suffer some, too, at the same time. By all means\r\nmake him President, gentlemen. He will feed you bounteously--if--if there\r\nis any left after he shall have helped himself.\r\n\r\nBut, as General Taylor is, par excellence, the hero of the Mexican War,\r\nand as you Democrats say we Whigs have always opposed the war, you think\r\nit must be very awkward and embarrassing for us to go for General Taylor.\r\nThe declaration that we have always opposed the war is true or false,\r\naccording as one may understand the term \"oppose the war.\" If to say \"the\r\nwar was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President\"\r\nby opposing the war, then the Whigs have very generally opposed it.\r\nWhenever they have spoken at all, they have said this; and they have said\r\nit on what has appeared good reason to them. The marching an army into the\r\nmidst of a peaceful Mexican settlement, frightening the inhabitants away,\r\nleaving their growing crops and other property to destruction, to you may\r\nappear a perfectly amiable, peaceful, unprovoking procedure; but it does\r\nnot appear so to us. So to call such an act, to us appears no other than\r\na naked, impudent absurdity, and we speak of it accordingly. But if, when\r\nthe war had begun, and had become the cause of the country, the giving\r\nof our money and our blood, in common with yours, was support of the\r\nwar, then it is not true that we have always opposed the war. With few\r\nindividual exceptions, you have constantly had our votes here for all the\r\nnecessary supplies. And, more than this, you have had the services, the\r\nblood, and the lives of our political brethren in every trial and on\r\nevery field. The beardless boy and the mature man, the humble and the\r\ndistinguished--you have had them. Through suffering and death, by disease\r\nand in battle they have endured and fought and fell with you. Clay and\r\nWebster each gave a son, never to be returned. From the State of my\r\nown residence, besides other worthy but less known Whig names, we sent\r\nMarshall, Morrison, Baker, and Hardin; they all fought, and one fell, and\r\nin the fall of that one we lost our best Whig man. Nor were the Whigs\r\nfew in number, or laggard in the day of danger. In that fearful, bloody,\r\nbreathless struggle at Buena Vista, where each man's hard task was to beat\r\nback five foes or die himself, of the five high officers who perished,\r\nfour were Whigs.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of this, I mean no odious comparison between the lion-hearted\r\nWhigs and the Democrats who fought there. On other occasions, and\r\namong the lower officers and privates on that occasion, I doubt not the\r\nproportion was different. I wish to do justice to all. I think of all\r\nthose brave men as Americans, in whose proud fame, as an American, I too\r\nhave a share. Many of them, Whigs and Democrats are my constituents and\r\npersonal friends; and I thank them,--more than thank them,--one and all,\r\nfor the high imperishable honor they have conferred on our common State.\r\n\r\nBut the distinction between the cause of the President in beginning the\r\nwar, and the cause of the country after it was begun, is a distinction\r\nwhich you cannot perceive. To you the President and the country seem to\r\nbe all one. You are interested to see no distinction between them; and I\r\nventure to suggest that probably your interest blinds you a little. We\r\nsee the distinction, as we think, clearly enough; and our friends who have\r\nfought in the war have no difficulty in seeing it also. What those who\r\nhave fallen would say, were they alive and here, of course we can never\r\nknow; but with those who have returned there is no difficulty. Colonel\r\nHaskell and Major Gaines, members here, both fought in the war, and both\r\nof them underwent extraordinary perils and hardships; still they, like all\r\nother Whigs here, vote, on the record, that the war was unnecessarily and\r\nunconstitutionally commenced by the President. And even General Taylor\r\nhimself, the noblest Roman of them all, has declared that as a citizen,\r\nand particularly as a soldier, it is sufficient for him to know that his\r\ncountry is at war with a foreign nation, to do all in his power to\r\nbring it to a speedy and honorable termination by the most vigorous and\r\nenergetic operations, without inquiry about its justice, or anything else\r\nconnected with it.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, let our Democratic friends be comforted with the assurance\r\nthat we are content with our position, content with our company, and\r\ncontent with our candidate; and that although they, in their generous\r\nsympathy, think we ought to be miserable, we really are not, and that they\r\nmay dismiss the great anxiety they have on our account.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, I see I have but three minutes left, and this forces me to\r\nthrow out one whole branch of my subject. A single word on still another.\r\nThe Democrats are keen enough to frequently remind us that we have some\r\ndissensions in our ranks. Our good friend from Baltimore immediately\r\nbefore me [Mr. McLane] expressed some doubt the other day as to which\r\nbranch of our party General Taylor would ultimately fall into the hands\r\nof. That was a new idea to me. I knew we had dissenters, but I did not\r\nknow they were trying to get our candidate away from us. I would like\r\nto say a word to our dissenters, but I have not the time. Some such we\r\ncertainly have; have you none, gentlemen Democrats? Is it all union and\r\nharmony in your ranks? no bickerings? no divisions? If there be doubt as\r\nto which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as\r\nto which of your candidates will get your party? I have heard some things\r\nfrom New York; and if they are true, one might well say of your party\r\nthere, as a drunken fellow once said when he heard the reading of an\r\nindictment for hog-stealing. The clerk read on till he got to and through\r\nthe words, \"did steal, take, and carry away ten boars, ten sows, ten\r\nshoats, and ten pigs,\" at which he exclaimed, \"Well, by golly, that is\r\nthe most equally divided gang of hogs I ever did hear of!\" If there is any\r\nother gang of hogs more equally divided than the Democrats of New York are\r\nabout this time, I have not heard of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH DELIVERED AT WORCESTER, MASS., ON SEPT. 12, 1848.\r\n\r\n(From the Boston Advertiser.)\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg then introduced to the meeting the Hon. Abram Lincoln, Whig\r\nmember of Congress from Illinois, a representative of free soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln has a very tall and thin figure, with an intellectual face,\r\nshowing a searching mind, and a cool judgment. He spoke in a clear and\r\ncool and very eloquent manner, for an hour and a half, carrying the\r\naudience with him in his able arguments and brilliant illustrations--only\r\ninterrupted by warm and frequent applause. He began by expressing a real\r\nfeeling of modesty in addressing an audience \"this side of the mountains,\"\r\na part of the country where, in the opinion of the people of his section,\r\neverybody was supposed to be instructed and wise. But he had devoted his\r\nattention to the question of the coming Presidential election, and was\r\nnot unwilling to exchange with all whom he might the ideas to which he\r\nhad arrived. He then began to show the fallacy of some of the arguments\r\nagainst Gen. Taylor, making his chief theme the fashionable statement of\r\nall those who oppose him (\"the old Locofocos as well as the new\") that he\r\nhas no principles, and that the Whig party have abandoned their principles\r\nby adopting him as their candidate. He maintained that Gen. Taylor\r\noccupied a high and unexceptionable Whig ground, and took for his first\r\ninstance and proof of this the statement in the Allison letter--with\r\nregard to the bank, tariff, rivers and harbors, etc.--that the will of the\r\npeople should produce its own results, without executive influence. The\r\nprinciple that the people should do what--under the Constitution--as they\r\nplease, is a Whig principle. All that Gen. Taylor is not only to consent\r\nto, but appeal to the people to judge and act for themselves. And this was\r\nno new doctrine for Whigs. It was the \"platform\" on which they had\r\nfought all their battles, the resistance of executive influence, and the\r\nprinciple of enabling the people to frame the government according to\r\ntheir will. Gen. Taylor consents to be the candidate, and to assist the\r\npeople to do what they think to be their duty, and think to be best in\r\ntheir national affairs, but because he don't want to tell what we ought to\r\ndo, he is accused of having no principles. The Whigs here maintained for\r\nyears that neither the influence, the duress, or the prohibition of the\r\nexecutive should control the legitimately expressed will of the people;\r\nand now that, on that very ground, Gen. Taylor says that he should use the\r\npower given him by the people to do, to the best of his judgment, the will\r\nof the people, he is accused of want of principle, and of inconsistency in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln proceeded to examine the absurdity of an attempt to make a\r\nplatform or creed for a national party, to all parts of which all\r\nmust consent and agree, when it was clearly the intention and the true\r\nphilosophy of our government, that in Congress all opinions and principles\r\nshould be represented, and that when the wisdom of all had been compared\r\nand united, the will of the majority should be carried out. On this ground\r\nhe conceived (and the audience seemed to go with him) that Gen. Taylor\r\nheld correct, sound republican principles.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln then passed to the subject of slavery in the States,\r\nsaying that the people of Illinois agreed entirely with the people of\r\nMassachusetts on this subject, except perhaps that they did not keep so\r\nconstantly thinking about it. All agreed that slavery was an evil, but\r\nthat we were not responsible for it and cannot affect it in States of this\r\nUnion where we do not live. But the question of the extension of slavery\r\nto new territories of this country is a part of our responsibility and\r\ncare, and is under our control. In opposition to this Mr. L. believed that\r\nthe self-named \"Free Soil\" party was far behind the Whigs. Both parties\r\nopposed the extension. As he understood it the new party had no principle\r\nexcept this opposition. If their platform held any other, it was in such\r\na general way that it was like the pair of pantaloons the Yankee pedlar\r\noffered for sale, \"large enough for any man, small enough for any boy.\"\r\nThey therefore had taken a position calculated to break down their single\r\nimportant declared object. They were working for the election of either\r\nGen. Cass or Gen. Taylor. The speaker then went on to show, clearly and\r\neloquently, the danger of extension of slavery, likely to result from the\r\nelection of Gen. Cass. To unite with those who annexed the new territory\r\nto prevent the extension of slavery in that territory seemed to him to\r\nbe in the highest degree absurd and ridiculous. Suppose these gentlemen\r\nsucceed in electing Mr. Van Buren, they had no specific means to prevent\r\nthe extension of slavery to New Mexico and California, and Gen. Taylor, he\r\nconfidently believed, would not encourage it, and would not prohibit its\r\nrestriction. But if Gen. Cass was elected, he felt certain that the plans\r\nof farther extension of territory would be encouraged, and those of the\r\nextension of slavery would meet no check. The \"Free Soil\" mart in claiming\r\nthat name indirectly attempts a deception, by implying that Whigs were\r\nnot Free Soil men. Declaring that they would \"do their duty and leave the\r\nconsequences to God\" merely gave an excuse for taking a course they were\r\nnot able to maintain by a fair and full argument. To make this declaration\r\ndid not show what their duty was. If it did we should have no use for\r\njudgment, we might as well be made without intellect; and when divine or\r\nhuman law does not clearly point out what is our duty, we have no means of\r\nfinding out what it is but by using our most intelligent judgment of the\r\nconsequences. If there were divine law or human law for voting for Martin\r\nVan Buren, or if a fair examination of the consequences and just reasoning\r\nwould show that voting for him would bring about the ends they pretended\r\nto wish--then he would give up the argument. But since there was no fixed\r\nlaw on the subject, and since the whole probable result of their action\r\nwould be an assistance in electing Gen. Cass, he must say that they were\r\nbehind the Whigs in their advocacy of the freedom of the soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln proceeded to rally the Buffalo convention for forbearing to\r\nsay anything--after all the previous declarations of those members who\r\nwere formerly Whigs--on the subject of the Mexican War, because the Van\r\nBurens had been known to have supported it. He declared that of all the\r\nparties asking the confidence of the country, this new one had less of\r\nprinciple than any other.\r\n\r\nHe wondered whether it was still the opinion of these Free Soil gentlemen,\r\nas declared in the \"whereas\" at Buffalo, that the Whig and Democratic\r\nparties were both entirely dissolved and absorbed into their own body. Had\r\nthe Vermont election given them any light? They had calculated on making\r\nas great an impression in that State as in any part of the Union, and\r\nthere their attempts had been wholly ineffectual. Their failure was a\r\ngreater success than they would find in any other part of the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln went on to say that he honestly believed that all those who\r\nwished to keep up the character of the Union; who did not believe\r\nin enlarging our field, but in keeping our fences where they are and\r\ncultivating our present possessions, making it a garden, improving the\r\nmorals and education of the people, devoting the administrations to this\r\npurpose; all real Whigs, friends of good honest government--the race was\r\nours. He had opportunities of hearing from almost every part of the Union\r\nfrom reliable sources and had not heard of a county in which we had not\r\nreceived accessions from other parties. If the true Whigs come forward\r\nand join these new friends, they need not have a doubt. We had a candidate\r\nwhose personal character and principles he had already described, whom\r\nhe could not eulogize if he would. Gen. Taylor had been constantly,\r\nperseveringly, quietly standing up, doing his duty and asking no praise\r\nor reward for it. He was and must be just the man to whom the interests,\r\nprinciples, and prosperity of the country might be safely intrusted.\r\nHe had never failed in anything he had undertaken, although many of his\r\nduties had been considered almost impossible.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln then went into a terse though rapid review of the origin\r\nof the Mexican War and the connection of the administration and General\r\nTaylor with it, from which he deduced a strong appeal to the Whigs present\r\nto do their duty in the support of General Taylor, and closed with the\r\nwarmest aspirations for and confidence in a deserved success.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his truly masterly and convincing speech, the audience\r\ngave three enthusiastic cheers for Illinois, and three more for the\r\neloquent Whig member from the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FATHER'S REQUEST FOR MONEY\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS LINCOLN\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 24, 1848.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FATHER:--Your letter of the 7th was received night before last.\r\nI very cheerfully send you the twenty dollars, which sum you say is\r\nnecessary to save your land from sale. It is singular that you should\r\nhave forgotten a judgment against you; and it is more singular that the\r\nplaintiff should have let you forget it so long; particularly as I suppose\r\nyou always had property enough to satisfy a judgment of that amount.\r\nBefore you pay it, it would be well to be sure you have not paid, or at\r\nleast, that you cannot prove you have paid it.\r\n\r\nGive my love to mother and all the connections. Affectionately your son,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1849\r\n\r\nBILL TO ABOLISH SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Committee on the District of Columbia be instructed to\r\nreport a bill in substance as follows:\r\n\r\nSec. 1.

If he\r\nunderstood those objections, the first was that if the bill were to become\r\na law, it would be used to lock large portions of the public lands from\r\nsale, without at last effecting the ostensible object of the bill--the\r\nconstruction of railroads in the new States; and secondly, that Congress\r\nwould be forced to the abandonment of large portions of the public lands\r\nto the States for which they might be reserved, without their paying for\r\nthem. This he understood to be the substance of the objections of the\r\ngentleman from Ohio to the passage of the bill.\r\n\r\nIf he could get the attention of the House for a few minutes, he would ask\r\ngentlemen to tell us what motive could induce any State Legislature, or\r\nindividual, or company of individuals, of the new States, to expend money\r\nin surveying roads which they might know they could not make.\r\n\r\n(A voice: They are not required to make the road.)\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln continued: That was not the case he was making. What motive\r\nwould tempt any set of men to go into an extensive survey of a railroad\r\nwhich they did not intend to make? What good would it do? Did men act\r\nwithout motive? Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money\r\nwhich could be of no account to them? He generally found that men who have\r\nmoney were disposed to hold on to it, unless they could see something to\r\nbe made by its investment. He could not see what motive of advantage to\r\nthe new States could be subserved by merely keeping the public lands out\r\nof market, and preventing their settlement. As far as he could see, the\r\nnew States were wholly without any motive to do such a thing. This, then,\r\nhe took to be a good answer to the first objection.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the fact assumed, that after a while, the new States having\r\ngot hold of the public lands to a certain extent, they would turn round\r\nand compel Congress to relinquish all claim to them, he had a word to say,\r\nby way of recurring to the history of the past. When was the time to come\r\n(he asked) when the States in which the public lands were situated would\r\ncompose a majority of the representation in Congress, or anything like\r\nit? A majority of Representatives would very soon reside west of the\r\nmountains, he admitted; but would they all come from States in which\r\nthe public lands were situated? They certainly would not; for, as these\r\nWestern States grew strong in Congress, the public lands passed away from\r\nthem, and they got on the other side of the question; and the gentleman\r\nfrom Ohio [Mr. Vinton] was an example attesting that fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Vinton interrupted here to say that he had stood on this question just\r\nwhere he was now, for five and twenty years.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was not making an argument for the purpose of convicting the\r\ngentleman of any impropriety at all. He was speaking of a fact in history,\r\nof which his State was an example. He was referring to a plain principle\r\nin the nature of things. The State of Ohio had now grown to be a giant.\r\nShe had a large delegation on that floor; but was she now in favor of\r\ngranting lands to the new States, as she used to be? The New England\r\nStates, New York, and the Old Thirteen were all rather quiet upon the\r\nsubject; and it was seen just now that a member from one of the new States\r\nwas the first man to rise up in opposition. And such would be with the\r\nhistory of this question for the future. There never would come a time\r\nwhen the people residing in the States embracing the public lands would\r\nhave the entire control of this subject; and so it was a matter of\r\ncertainty that Congress would never do more in this respect than what\r\nwould be dictated by a just liberality. The apprehension, therefore,\r\nthat the public lands were in danger of being wrested from the General\r\nGovernment by the strength of the delegation in Congress from the new\r\nStates, was utterly futile. There never could be such a thing. If we take\r\nthese lands (said he) it will not be without your consent. We can never\r\noutnumber you. The result is that all fear of the new States turning\r\nagainst the right of Congress to the public domain must be effectually\r\nquelled, as those who are opposed to that interest must always hold a vast\r\nmajority here, and they will never surrender the whole or any part of\r\nthe public lands unless they themselves choose to do so. That was all he\r\ndesired to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON FEDERAL POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 9, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: Colonel R. D. Baker and myself are the only Whig members of\r\nCongress from Illinois of the Thirtieth, and he of the Thirty-first. We\r\nhave reason to think the Whigs of that State hold us responsible, to some\r\nextent, for the appointments which may be made of our citizens. We do not\r\nknow you personally, and our efforts to you have so far been unavailing.\r\nI therefore hope I am not obtrusive in saying in this way, for him\r\nand myself, that when a citizen of Illinois is to be appointed in\r\nyour department, to an office either in or out of the State, we most\r\nrespectfully ask to be heard.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE POLITICAL PATRONAGE REQUESTS\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 10, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nSIR:--There are several applicants for the office of United States\r\nMarshal for the District of Illinois. Among the most prominent of them are\r\nBenjamin Bond, Esq., of Carlyle, and Thomas, Esq., of Galena. Mr. Bond\r\nI know to be personally every way worthy of the office; and he is very\r\nnumerously and most respectably recommended. His papers I send to you; and\r\nI solicit for his claims a full and fair consideration.\r\n\r\nHaving said this much, I add that in my individual judgment the\r\nappointment of Mr. Thomas would be the better.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n(Indorsed on Mr. Bond's papers.)\r\n\r\nIn this and the accompanying envelope are the recommendations of about\r\ntwo hundred good citizens of all parts of Illinois, that Benjamin Bond be\r\nappointed marshal for that district. They include the names of nearly\r\nall our Whigs who now are, or have ever been, members of the State\r\nLegislature, besides forty-six of the Democratic members of the present\r\nLegislature, and many other good citizens. I add that from personal\r\nknowledge I consider Mr. Bond every way worthy of the office, and\r\nqualified to fill it. Holding the individual opinion that the appointment\r\nof a different gentleman would be better, I ask especial attention and\r\nconsideration for his claims, and for the opinions expressed in his favor\r\nby those over whom I can claim no superiority.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April 7, 1849\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE HOME DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I recommend that Walter Davis be appointed receiver of the\r\nland-office at this place, whenever there shall be a vacancy. I cannot\r\nsay that Mr. Herndon, the present incumbent, has failed in the proper\r\ndischarge of any of the duties of the office. He is a very warm partisan,\r\nand openly and actively opposed to the election of General Taylor. I\r\nalso understand that since General Taylor's election he has received\r\na reappointment from Mr. Polk, his old commission not having expired.\r\nWhether this is true the records of the department will show. I may add\r\nthat the Whigs here almost universally desire his removal.\r\n\r\nI give no opinion of my own, but state the facts, and express the hope\r\nthat the department will act in this as in all other cases on some proper\r\ngeneral rule.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--The land district to which this office belongs is very nearly if\r\nnot entirely within my district; so that Colonel Baker, the other Whig\r\nrepresentative, claims no voice in the appointment. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April 7, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE HOME DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I recommend that Turner R. King, now of Pekin, Illinois, be\r\nappointed register of the land-office at this place whenever there shall\r\nbe a vacancy.\r\n\r\nI do not know that Mr. Barret, the present incumbent, has failed in the\r\nproper discharge of any of his duties in the office. He is a decided\r\npartisan, and openly and actively opposed the election of General Taylor.\r\nI understand, too, that since the election of General Taylor, Mr. Barret\r\nhas received a reappointment from Mr. Polk, his old commission not having\r\nexpired. Whether this be true, the records of the department will show.\r\n\r\nWhether he should be removed I give no opinion, but merely express the\r\nwish that the department may act upon some proper general rule, and that\r\nMr. Barret's case may not be made an exception to it.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.-The land district to which this office belongs is very nearly if\r\nnot entirely within my district; so that Colonel Baker, the other Whig\r\nrepresentative, claims no voice in the appointment. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April 7,1849.\r\n\r\nHON. POSTMASTER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nDEAR Sir:--I recommend that Abner Y. Ellis be appointed postmaster at\r\nthis place, whenever there shall be a vacancy. J. R. Diller, the present\r\nincumbent, I cannot say has failed in the proper discharge of any of\r\nthe duties of the office. He, however, has been an active partisan in\r\nopposition to us.\r\n\r\nLocated at the seat of government of the State, he has been, for part\r\nif not the whole of the time he has held the office, a member of the\r\nDemocratic State Central Committee, signing his name to their addresses\r\nand manifestoes; and has been, as I understand, reappointed by Mr. Polk\r\nsince General Taylor's election. These are the facts of the case as I\r\nunderstand them, and I give no opinion of mine as to whether he should\r\nor should not be removed. My wish is that the department may adopt some\r\nproper general rule for such cases, and that Mr. Diller may not be made an\r\nexception to it, one way or the other.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--This office, with its delivery, is entirely within my district; so\r\nthat Colonel Baker, the other Whig representative, claims no voice in the\r\nappointment.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April 7, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE HOME DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I recommend that William Butler be appointed pension agent\r\nfor the Illinois agency, when the place shall be vacant. Mr. Hurst, the\r\npresent incumbent, I believe has performed the duties very well. He is a\r\ndecided partisan, and I believe expects to be removed. Whether he shall, I\r\nsubmit to the department. This office is not confined to my district, but\r\npertains to the whole State; so that Colonel Baker has an equal right with\r\nmyself to be heard concerning it. However, the office is located here;\r\nand I think it is not probable that any one would desire to remove from a\r\ndistance to take it.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMPSON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, April 25, 1849.\r\n\r\nDEAR THOMPSON: A tirade is still kept up against me here for recommending\r\nT. R. King. This morning it is openly avowed that my supposed influence at\r\nWashington shall be broken down generally, and King's prospects defeated\r\nin particular. Now, what I have done in this matter I have done at the\r\nrequest of you and some other friends in Tazewell; and I therefore ask you\r\nto either admit it is wrong or come forward and sustain me. If the truth\r\nwill permit, I propose that you sustain me in the following manner: copy\r\nthe inclosed scrap in your own handwriting and get everybody (not three or\r\nfour, but three or four hundred) to sign it, and then send it to me. Also,\r\nhave six, eight or ten of our best known Whig friends there write to me\r\nindividual letters, stating the truth in this matter as they understand\r\nit. Don't neglect or delay in the matter. I understand information of an\r\nindictment having been found against him about three years ago, for gaming\r\nor keeping a gaming house, has been sent to the department. I shall try\r\nto take care of it at the department till your action can be had and\r\nforwarded on.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD ILLINOIS. May 10, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I regret troubling you so often in relation to the land-offices\r\nhere, but I hope you will perceive the necessity of it, and excuse me. On\r\nthe 7th of April I wrote you recommending Turner R. King for register, and\r\nWalter Davis for receiver. Subsequently I wrote you that, for a private\r\nreason, I had concluded to transpose them. That private reason was the\r\nrequest of an old personal friend who himself desired to be receiver,\r\nbut whom I felt it my duty to refuse a recommendation. He said if I would\r\ntranspose King and Davis he would be satisfied. I thought it a whim, but,\r\nanxious to oblige him, I consented. Immediately he commenced an assault\r\nupon King's character, intending, as I suppose, to defeat his appointment,\r\nand thereby secure another chance for himself. This double offence of bad\r\nfaith to me and slander upon a good man is so totally outrageous that I\r\nnow ask to have King and Davis placed as I originally recommended,--that\r\nis, King for register and Davis for receiver.\r\n\r\nAn effort is being made now to have Mr. Barret, the present register,\r\nretained. I have already said he has done the duties of the office well,\r\nand I now add he is a gentleman in the true sense. Still, he submits to be\r\nthe instrument of his party to injure us. His high character enables him\r\nto do it more effectually. Last year he presided at the convention which\r\nnominated the Democratic candidate for Congress in this district, and\r\nafterward ran for the State Senate himself, not desiring the seat, but\r\navowedly to aid and strengthen his party. He made speech after speech with\r\na degree of fierceness and coarseness against General Taylor not quite\r\nconsistent with his habitually gentlemanly deportment. At least one (and\r\nI think more) of those who are now trying to have him retained was himself\r\nan applicant for this very office, and, failing to get my recommendation,\r\nnow takes this turn.\r\n\r\nIn writing you a third time in relation to these offices, I stated that I\r\nsupposed charges had been forwarded to you against King, and that I would\r\ninquire into the truth of them. I now send you herewith what I suppose\r\nwill be an ample defense against any such charges. I ask attention to all\r\nthe papers, but particularly to the letters of Mr. David Mack, and the\r\npaper with the long list of names. There is no mistake about King's being\r\na good man. After the unjust assault upon him, and considering the just\r\nclaims of Tazewell County, as indicated in the letters I inclose you, it\r\nwould in my opinion be injustice, and withal a blunder, not to appoint\r\nhim, at least as soon as any one is appointed to either of the offices\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., May 19, 1849.\r\n\r\nDEAR GILLESPIE:\r\n\r\nButterfield will be commissioner of the Gen'l Land Office, unless\r\nprevented by strong and speedy efforts. Ewing is for him, and he is only\r\nnot appointed yet because Old Zach. hangs fire.\r\n\r\nI have reliable information of this. Now, if you agree with me that this\r\nappointment would dissatisfy rather than gratify the Whigs of this\r\nState, that it would slacken their energies in future contests, that his\r\nappointment in '41 is an old sore with them which they will not patiently\r\nhave reopened,--in a word that his appointment now would be a fatal\r\nblunder to the administration and our political men here in Illinois,\r\nwrite Crittenden to that effect. He can control the matter. Were you to\r\nwrite Ewing I fear the President would never hear of your letter. This may\r\nbe mere suspicion. You might write directly to Old Zach. You will be the\r\nbest judge of the propriety of that. Not a moment's time is to be lost.\r\n\r\nLet this be confidential except with Mr. Edwards and a few others whom you\r\nknow I would trust just as I do you.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR GENERAL LAND-OFFICE APPPOINTMENT\r\n\r\nTO E. EMBREE.\r\n\r\n[Confidential]\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, May 25, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. E. EMBREE\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I am about to ask a favor of you, one which I hope will not\r\ncost you much. I understand the General Land-Office is about to be given\r\nto Illinois, and that Mr. Ewing desires Justin Butterfield, of Chicago, to\r\nbe the man. I give you my word, the appointment of Mr. Butterfield will\r\nbe an egregious political blunder. It will give offence to the whole Whig\r\nparty here, and be worse than a dead loss to the administration of so much\r\nof its patronage. Now, if you can conscientiously do so, I wish you to\r\nwrite General Taylor at once, saying that either I or the man I recommend\r\nshould in your opinion be appointed to that office, if any one from\r\nIllinois shall be. I restrict my request to Illinois because you may have\r\na man from your own State, and I do not ask to interfere with that.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A PATENT\r\n\r\nIMPROVED METHOD OF LIFTING VESSELS OVER SHOALS.\r\n\r\nApplication for Patent:\r\n\r\nWhat I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is\r\nthe combination of expansible buoyant chambers placed at the sides of a\r\nvessel with the main shaft or shafts by means of the sliding spars, which\r\npass down through the buoyant chambers and are made fast to their bottoms\r\nand the series of ropes and pulleys or their equivalents in such a manner\r\nthat by turning the main shaft or shafts in one direction the buoyant\r\nchambers will be forced downward into the water, and at the same time\r\nexpanded and filled with air for buoying up the vessel by the displacement\r\nof water, and by turning the shafts in an opposite direction the buoyant\r\nchambers will be contracted into a small space and secured against injury.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., June 3, 1849\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Vandalia, the receiver's office at which place is the subject\r\nof the within, is not in my district; and I have been much perplexed to\r\nexpress any preference between Dr. Stapp and Mr. Remann. If any one man\r\nis better qualified for such an office than all others, Dr. Stapp is that\r\nman; still, I believe a large majority of the Whigs of the district prefer\r\nMr. Remann, who also is a good man. Perhaps the papers on file will enable\r\nyou to judge better than I can. The writers of the within are good men,\r\nresiding within the land district.\r\n\r\nYour obt. servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 5, 1849.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Your two letters were received last night. I have a great\r\nmany letters to write, and so cannot write very long ones. There must be\r\nsome mistake about Walter Davis saying I promised him the post-office.\r\nI did not so promise him. I did tell him that if the distribution of the\r\noffices should fall into my hands, he should have something; and if\r\nI shall be convinced he has said any more than this, I shall be\r\ndisappointed. I said this much to him because, as I understand, he is of\r\ngood character, is one of the young men, is of the mechanics, and always\r\nfaithful and never troublesome; a Whig, and is poor, with the support of a\r\nwidow mother thrown almost exclusively on him by the death of his brother.\r\nIf these are wrong reasons, then I have been wrong; but I have certainly\r\nnot been selfish in it, because in my greatest need of friends he was\r\nagainst me, and for Baker.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S. Let the above be confidential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nDEAR GILLESPIE:\r\n\r\nMr. Edwards is unquestionably offended with me in connection with the\r\nmatter of the General Land-Office. He wrote a letter against me which was\r\nfiled at the department.\r\n\r\nThe better part of one's life consists of his friendships; and, of them,\r\nmine with Mr. Edwards was one of the most cherished. I have not been\r\nfalse to it. At a word I could have had the office any time before the\r\ndepartment was committed to Mr. Butterfield, at least Mr. Ewing and the\r\nPresident say as much. That word I forbore to speak, partly for other\r\nreasons, but chiefly for Mr. Edwards' sake, losing the office (that he\r\nmight gain it) I was always for; but to lose his friendship, by the effort\r\nfor him, would oppress me very much, were I not sustained by the utmost\r\nconsciousness of rectitude. I first determined to be an applicant,\r\nunconditionally, on the 2nd of June; and I did so then upon being informed\r\nby a telegraphic despatch that the question was narrowed down to Mr. B and\r\nmyself, and that the Cabinet had postponed the appointment three weeks,\r\nfor my benefit. Not doubting that Mr. Edwards was wholly out of the\r\nquestion I, nevertheless, would not then have become an applicant had I\r\nsupposed he would thereby be brought to suspect me of treachery to him.\r\nTwo or three days afterwards a conversation with Levi Davis convinced me\r\nMr. Edwards was dissatisfied; but I was then too far in to get out. His\r\nown letter, written on the 25th of April, after I had fully informed\r\nhim of all that had passed, up to within a few days of that time, gave\r\nassurance I had that entire confidence from him which I felt my uniform\r\nand strong friendship for him entitled me to. Among other things it says,\r\n\"Whatever course your judgment may dictate as proper to be pursued, shall\r\nnever be excepted to by me.\" I also had had a letter from Washington,\r\nsaying Chambers, of the Republic, had brought a rumor then, that Mr. E had\r\ndeclined in my favor, which rumor I judged came from Mr. E himself, as I\r\nhad not then breathed of his letter to any living creature. In saying\r\nI had never, before the 2nd of June, determined to be an applicant,\r\nunconditionally, I mean to admit that, before then, I had said\r\nsubstantially I would take the office rather than it should be lost to\r\nthe State, or given to one in the State whom the Whigs did not want; but\r\nI aver that in every instance in which I spoke of myself, I intended to\r\nkeep, and now believe I did keep, Mr. E above myself. Mr. Edwards' first\r\nsuspicion was that I had allowed Baker to overreach me, as his friend,\r\nin behalf of Don Morrison. I knew this was a mistake; and the result has\r\nproved it. I understand his view now is, that if I had gone to open war\r\nwith Baker I could have ridden him down, and had the thing all my own way.\r\nI believe no such thing. With Baker and some strong man from the Military\r\ntract & elsewhere for Morrison, and we and some strong man from the\r\nWabash & elsewhere for Mr. E, it was not possible for either to succeed.\r\nI believed this in March, and I know it now. The only thing which gave\r\neither any chance was the very thing Baker & I proposed,--an adjustment\r\nwith themselves.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to know how Butterfield finally beat me. I can not tell\r\nyou particulars now, but will when I see you. In the meantime let it be\r\nunderstood I am not greatly dissatisfied,--I wish the offer had been so\r\nbestowed as to encourage our friends in future contests, and I regret\r\nexceedingly Mr. Edwards' feelings towards me. These two things away, I\r\nshould have no regrets,--at least I think I would not.\r\n\r\nWrite me soon.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS OF SYMPATHY WITH THE CAUSE OF HUNGARIAN FREEDOM,\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER [1??], 1849.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting to express sympathy with the cause of Hungarian freedom, Dr.\r\nTodd, Thos. Lewis, Hon. A. Lincoln, and Wm. Carpenter were appointed a\r\ncommittee to present appropriate resolutions, which reported through Hon.\r\nA. Lincoln the following:\r\n\r\nResolved, That, in their present glorious struggle for liberty, the\r\nHungarians command our highest admiration and have our warmest sympathy.\r\n\r\nResolved, That they have our most ardent prayers for their speedy triumph\r\nand final success.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Government of the United States should acknowledge the\r\nindependence of Hungary as a nation of freemen at the very earliest moment\r\nconsistent with our amicable relations with the government against which\r\nthey are contending.\r\n\r\nResolved, That, in the opinion of this meeting, the immediate\r\nacknowledgment of the independence of Hungary by our government is due\r\nfrom American freemen to their struggling brethren, to the general cause\r\nof republican liberty, and not violative of the just rights of any nation\r\nor people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Dr. WILLIAM FITHIAN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Sept. 14, 1849.\r\n\r\nDr. WILLIAM FITHIAN, Danville, Ill.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR:--Your letter of the 9th was received a day or two ago. The\r\nnotes and mortgages you enclosed me were duly received. I also got the\r\noriginal Blanchard mortgage from Antrim Campbell, with whom Blanchard had\r\nleft it for you. I got a decree of foreclosure on the whole; but, owing to\r\nthere being no redemption on the sale to be under the Blanchard mortgage,\r\nthe court allowed Mobley till the first of March to pay the money, before\r\nadvertising for sale. Stuart was empowered by Mobley to appear for him,\r\nand I had to take such decree as he would consent to, or none at all. I\r\ncast the matter about in my mind and concluded that as I could not get\r\na decree we would put the accrued interest at interest, and thereby more\r\nthan match the fact of throwing the Blanchard debt back from twelve to six\r\nper cent., it was better to do it. This is the present state of the case.\r\n\r\nI can well enough understand and appreciate your suggestions about the\r\nLand-Office at Danville; but in my present condition, I can do nothing.\r\n\r\nYours, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. 15, 1849.\r\n\r\n------ ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--On my return from Kentucky I found your letter of the 7th of\r\nNovember, and have delayed answering it till now for the reason I now\r\nbriefly state. From the beginning of our acquaintance I had felt the\r\ngreatest kindness for you and had supposed it was reciprocated on your\r\npart. Last summer, under circumstances which I mentioned to you, I was\r\npainfully constrained to withhold a recommendation which you desired, and\r\nshortly afterwards I learned, in such a way as to believe it, that you\r\nwere indulging in open abuse of me. Of course my feelings were wounded.\r\nOn receiving your last letter the question occurred whether you were\r\nattempting to use me at the same time you would injure me, or whether you\r\nmight not have been misrepresented to me. If the former, I ought not to\r\nanswer you; if the latter, I ought, and so I have remained in suspense. I\r\nnow enclose you the letter, which you may use if you see fit.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\nA.

Monday, June 3, 1850.\r\n\r\nOn the opening of the Court this morning, the Hon. A. Lincoln, a member\r\nof the Bar of this Court, suggested the death of the Hon. Nathaniel\r\nPope, late a judge of this Court, since the adjournment of the last term;\r\nwhereupon, in token of respect for the memory of the deceased, it is\r\nordered that the Court do now adjourn until to-morrow morning at ten\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Stephen T. Logan, the Hon. Norman H. Purple, the Hon. David L.\r\nGregg, the Hon. A. Lincoln, and George W. Meeker, Esq., were appointed a\r\nCommittee to prepare resolutions.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, the Hon. Stephen T. Logan, in behalf of the Committee,\r\npresented the following preamble and resolutions:\r\n\r\nWhereas The Hon. Nathaniel Pope, District Judge of the United States Court\r\nfor the District of Illinois, having departed this life during the\r\nlast vacation of said Court, and the members of the Bar of said Court,\r\nentertaining the highest veneration for his memory, a profound respect for\r\nhis ability, great experience, and learning as a judge, and cherishing for\r\nhis many virtues, public and private, his earnest simplicity of character\r\nand unostentatious deportment, both in his public and private relations,\r\nthe most lively and affectionate recollections, have\r\n\r\nResolved, That, as a manifestation of their deep sense of the loss\r\nwhich has been sustained in his death, they will wear the usual badge of\r\nmourning during the residue of the term.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Chairman communicate to the family of the deceased a\r\ncopy of these proceedings, with an assurance of our sincere condolence on\r\naccount of their heavy bereavement.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Hon. A. Williams, District Attorney of this Court, be\r\nrequested in behalf of the meeting to present these proceedings to the\r\nCircuit Court, and respectfully to ask that they may be entered on the\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nE. N. POWELL, Sec'y. SAMUEL H. TREAT, Ch'n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES FOR LAW LECTURE\r\n\r\n(fragments)\r\n\r\nJULY 1, 1850\r\n\r\nDISCOURAGE LITIGATION. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you\r\ncan. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser--in\r\nfees, expenses, and waste of time. As a peace-maker the lawyer has a\r\nsuperior opportunity of being a good man. There will still be business\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nNever stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be found than one\r\nwho does this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually\r\nover-hauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles, whereon\r\nto stir up strife, and put money in his pocket? A moral tone ought to be\r\ninfused into the profession which should drive such men out of it.\r\n\r\nThe matter of fees is important, far beyond the mere question of bread\r\nand butter involved. Properly attended to, fuller justice is done to both\r\nlawyer and client. An exorbitant fee should never be claimed. As a general\r\nrule never take your whole fee in advance, nor any more than a small\r\nretainer. When fully paid beforehand, you are more than a common mortal\r\nif you can feel the same interest in the case as if something was still in\r\nprospect for you, as well as for your client. And when you lack interest\r\nin the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence in the\r\nperformance. Settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance. Then you\r\nwill feel that you are working for something, and you are sure to do your\r\nwork faithfully and well. Never sell a fee note--at least not before\r\nthe consideration service is performed. It leads to negligence and\r\ndishonesty--negligence by losing interest in the case, and dishonesty in\r\nrefusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration to fail.\r\n\r\nThis idea of a refund or reduction of charges from the lawyer in a failed\r\ncase is a new one to me--but not a bad one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1851\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS TO FAMILY MEMBERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nJanuary 2, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR JOHNSTON:--Your request for eighty dollars I do not think it best to\r\ncomply with now. At the various times when I have helped you a little you\r\nhave said to me, \"We can get along very well now\"; but in a very short\r\ntime I find you in the same difficulty again. Now, this can only happen by\r\nsome defect in your conduct. What that defect is, I think I know. You are\r\nnot lazy, and still you are an idler. I doubt whether, since I saw you,\r\nyou have done a good whole day's work in any one day. You do not very much\r\ndislike to work, and still you do not work much merely because it does\r\nnot seem to you that you could get much for it. This habit of uselessly\r\nwasting time is the whole difficulty; it is vastly important to you, and\r\nstill more so to your children, that you should break the habit. It is\r\nmore important to them, because they have longer to live, and can keep out\r\nof an idle habit before they are in it, easier than they can get out after\r\nthey are in.\r\n\r\nYou are now in need of some money; and what I propose is, that you shall\r\ngo to work, \"tooth and nail,\" for somebody who will give you money for it.\r\nLet father and your boys take charge of your things at home, prepare for\r\na crop, and make the crop, and you go to work for the best money wages, or\r\nin discharge of any debt you owe, that you can get; and, to secure you a\r\nfair reward for your labor, I now promise you, that for every dollar you\r\nwill, between this and the first of May, get for your own labor, either in\r\nmoney or as your own indebtedness, I will then give you one other dollar.\r\nBy this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get\r\nten more, making twenty dollars a month for your work. In this I do not\r\nmean you shall go off to St. Louis, or the lead mines, or the gold mines\r\nin California, but I mean for you to go at it for the best wages you can\r\nget close to home in Coles County. Now, if you will do this, you will be\r\nsoon out of debt, and, what is better, you will have a habit that will\r\nkeep you from getting in debt again. But, if I should now clear you out\r\nof debt, next year you would be just as deep in as ever. You say you would\r\nalmost give your place in heaven for seventy or eighty dollars. Then you\r\nvalue your place in heaven very cheap, for I am sure you can, with the\r\noffer I make, get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months'\r\nwork. You say if I will furnish you the money you will deed me the\r\nland, and, if you don't pay the money back, you will deliver possession.\r\nNonsense! If you can't now live with the land, how will you then live\r\nwithout it? You have always been kind to me, and I do not mean to be\r\nunkind to you. On the contrary, if you will but follow my advice, you will\r\nfind it worth more than eighty times eighty dollars to you.\r\n\r\nAffectionately your brother,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO C. HOYT.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan. 11, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. HOYT, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Our case is decided against us. The decision was announced\r\nthis morning. Very sorry, but there is no help. The history of the case\r\nsince it came here is this. On Friday morning last, Mr. Joy filed his\r\npapers, and entered his motion for a mandamus, and urged me to take up the\r\nmotion as soon as possible. I already had the points and authority sent me\r\nby you and by Mr. Goodrich, but had not studied them. I began preparing as\r\nfast as possible.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the same day I was again urged to take up the case. I\r\nrefused on the ground that I was not ready, and on which plea I also\r\ngot off over Saturday. But on Monday (the 14th) I had to go into it. We\r\noccupied the whole day, I using the large part. I made every point and\r\nused every authority sent me by yourself and by Mr. Goodrich; and in\r\naddition all the points I could think of and all the authorities I could\r\nfind myself. When I closed the argument on my part, a large package was\r\nhanded me, which proved to be the plat you sent me.\r\n\r\nThe court received it of me, but it was not different from the plat\r\nalready on the record. I do not think I could ever have argued the case\r\nbetter than I did. I did nothing else, but prepare to argue and argue this\r\ncase, from Friday morning till Monday evening. Very sorry for the result;\r\nbut I do not think it could have been prevented.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, January 12, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER:--On the day before yesterday I received a letter from\r\nHarriet, written at Greenup. She says she has just returned from your\r\nhouse, and that father is very low and will hardly recover. She also says\r\nyou have written me two letters, and that, although you do not expect me\r\nto come now, you wonder that I do not write.\r\n\r\nI received both your letters, and although I have not answered them it is\r\nnot because I have forgotten them, or been uninterested about them, but\r\nbecause it appeared to me that I could write nothing which would do any\r\ngood. You already know I desire that neither father nor mother shall be in\r\nwant of any comfort, either in health or sickness, while they live; and I\r\nfeel sure you have not failed to use my name, if necessary, to procure a\r\ndoctor, or anything else for father in his present sickness. My business\r\nis such that I could hardly leave home now, if it was not as it is, that\r\nmy own wife is sick abed. (It is a case of baby-sickness, and I suppose is\r\nnot dangerous.) I sincerely hope father may recover his health, but at\r\nall events, tell him to remember to call upon and confide in our great and\r\ngood and merciful Maker, who will not turn away from him in any extremity.\r\nHe notes the fall of a sparrow, and numbers the hairs of our heads, and He\r\nwill not forget the dying man who puts his trust in Him. Say to him that\r\nif we could meet now it is doubtful whether it would not be more painful\r\nthan pleasant, but that if it be his lot to go now, he will soon have a\r\njoyous meeting with many loved ones gone before, and where the rest of us,\r\nthrough the help of God, hope ere long to join them.\r\n\r\nWrite to me again when you receive this.\r\n\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETITION ON BEHALF OF ONE JOSHUA GIPSON\r\n\r\nTO THE JUDGE OF THE SANGAMON COUNTY COURT,\r\n\r\nMAY 13, 1851.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE, THE JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT\r\n\r\nIN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF SANGAMON AND STATE OF ILLINOIS:\r\n\r\nYour Petitioner, Joshua Gipson, respectfully represents that on or about\r\nthe 21st day of December, 1850, a judgment was rendered against your\r\nPetitioner for costs, by J. C. Spugg, one of the Justices of the Peace\r\nin and for said County of Sangamon, in a suit wherein your Petitioner\r\nwas plaintiff and James L. and C. B. Gerard were defendants; that said\r\njudgment was not the result of negligence on the part of your Petitioner;\r\nthat said judgment, in his opinion, is unjust and erroneous in this, that\r\nthe defendants were at that time and are indebted to this Petitioner in\r\nthe full amount of the principal and interest of the note sued on, the\r\nprincipal being, as affiant remembers and believes, thirty-one dollars\r\nand eighty two cents; and that, as affiant is informed and believes, the\r\ndefendants succeeded in the trial of said cause by proving old claims\r\nagainst your petitioner, in set-off against said note, which claims\r\nhad been settled, adjusted and paid before said note was executed. Your\r\nPetitioner further states that the reasons of his not being present at\r\nsaid trial, as he was not, and of its not being in his power to take an\r\nappeal in the ordinary way, as it was not, were that your Petitioner then\r\nresided in Edgar County about one hundred and twenty miles from where\r\ndefendants resided; that a very short time before the suit was commenced\r\nyour Petitioner was in Sangamon County for the purpose of collecting debts\r\ndue him, and with the rest, the note in question, which note had then been\r\ngiven more than a year, that your Petitioner then saw the defendant J.\r\nL. Gerard who is the principal in said note, and solicited payment of the\r\nsame; that said defendant then made no pretense that he did not owe the\r\nsame, but on the contrary expressly promised that he would come into\r\nSpringfield, in a very few days and either pay the money, or give a new\r\nnote, payable by the then next Christmas; that your Petitioner accordingly\r\nleft said note with said J. C. Spugg, with directions to give defendant\r\nfull time to pay the money or give the new note as above, and if he did\r\nneither to sue; and then affiant came home to Edgar County, not having the\r\nslightest suspicion that if suit should be brought, the defendants would\r\nmake any defense whatever; and your Petitioner never did in any way learn\r\nthat said suit had been commenced until more than twenty days after it had\r\nbeen decided against him. He therefore prays for a writ of Certiorari.\r\n\r\n   HIS\r\n JOSHUA x GIPSON\r\n   MARK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. 31, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER: Inclosed is the deed for the land. We are all well, and\r\nhave nothing in the way of news. We have had no Cholera here for about two\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nGive my love to all, and especially to Mother.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSHELBYVILLE, Nov. 4, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER:\r\n\r\nWhen I came into Charleston day before yesterday I learned that you are\r\nanxious to sell the land where you live, and move to Missouri. I have been\r\nthinking of this ever since, and cannot but think such a notion is utterly\r\nfoolish. What can you do in Missouri better than here? Is the land richer?\r\nCan you there, any more than here, raise corn and wheat and oats without\r\nwork? Will anybody there, any more than here, do your work for you? If you\r\nintend to go to work, there is no better place than right where you\r\nare; if you do not intend to go to work you cannot get along anywhere.\r\nSquirming and crawling about from place to place can do no good. You have\r\nraised no crop this year, and what you really want is to sell the land,\r\nget the money and spend it. Part with the land you have, and, my life upon\r\nit, you will never after own a spot big enough to bury you in. Half you\r\nwill get for the land you spend in moving to Missouri, and the other half\r\nyou will eat and drink and wear out, and no foot of land will be bought.\r\nNow I feel it is my duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery. I\r\nfeel that it is so even on your own account, and particularly on Mother's\r\naccount. The eastern forty acres I intend to keep for Mother while she\r\nlives; if you will not cultivate it, it will rent for enough to support\r\nher; at least it will rent for something. Her dower in the other two\r\nforties she can let you have, and no thanks to me.\r\n\r\nNow do not misunderstand this letter. I do not write it in any unkindness.\r\nI write it in order, if possible, to get you to face the truth, which\r\ntruth is, you are destitute because you have idled away all your time.\r\nYour thousand pretenses for not getting along better are all nonsense;\r\nthey deceive nobody but yourself. Go to work is the only cure for your\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nA word for Mother: Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him.\r\nIf I were you I would try it awhile. If you get tired of it (as I think\r\nyou will not) you can return to your own home. Chapman feels very kindly\r\nto you; and I have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNov. 4, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR MOTHER:\r\n\r\nChapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him. If I were you I\r\nwould try it awhile. If you get tired of it (as I think you will not) you\r\ncan return to your own home. Chapman feels very kindly to you; and I have\r\nno doubt he will make your situation very pleasant.\r\n\r\nSincerely your son,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSHELBYVILLE, November 9, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER:--When I wrote you before, I had not received your letter.\r\nI still think as I did, but if the land can be sold so that I get three\r\nhundred dollars to put to interest for Mother, I will not object, if she\r\ndoes not. But before I will make a deed, the money must be had, or secured\r\nbeyond all doubt, at ten per cent.\r\n\r\nAs to Abram, I do not want him, on my own account; but I understand he\r\nwants to live with me, so that he can go to school and get a fair start in\r\nthe world, which I very much wish him to have. When I reach home, if I can\r\nmake it convenient to take, I will take him, provided there is no mistake\r\nbetween us as to the object and terms of my taking him. In haste, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, November 25, 1851.\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER:--Your letter of the 22d is just received. Your proposal\r\nabout selling the east forty acres of land is all that I want or could\r\nclaim for myself; but I am not satisfied with it on Mother's account--I\r\nwant her to have her living, and I feel that it is my duty, to some\r\nextent, to see that she is not wronged. She had a right of dower (that is,\r\nthe use of one-third for life) in the other two forties; but, it seems,\r\nshe has already let you take that, hook and line. She now has the use of\r\nthe whole of the east forty, as long as she lives; and if it be sold, of\r\ncourse she is entitled to the interest on all the money it brings, as long\r\nas she lives; but you propose to sell it for three hundred dollars, take\r\none hundred away with you, and leave her two hundred at 8 per cent.,\r\nmaking her the enormous sum of 16 dollars a year. Now, if you are\r\nsatisfied with treating her in that way, I am not. It is true that you are\r\nto have that forty for two hundred dollars, at Mother's death, but you are\r\nnot to have it before. I am confident that land can be made to produce for\r\nMother at least $30 a year, and I can not, to oblige any living person,\r\nconsent that she shall be put on an allowance of sixteen dollars a year.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1852\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEULOGY ON HENRY CLAY,\r\n\r\nDELIVERED IN THE STATE HOUSE AT SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, JULY 16, 1852.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day of July, 1776, the people of a few feeble and oppressed\r\ncolonies of Great Britain, inhabiting a portion of the Atlantic coast of\r\nNorth America, publicly declared their national independence, and made\r\ntheir appeal to the justice of their cause and to the God of battles for\r\nthe maintenance of that declaration. That people were few in number and\r\nwithout resources, save only their wise heads and stout hearts. Within the\r\nfirst year of that declared independence, and while its maintenance was\r\nyet problematical, while the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels\r\nand their haughty would-be masters was still waging,--of undistinguished\r\nparents and in an obscure district of one of those colonies Henry Clay\r\nwas born. The infant nation and the infant child began the race of life\r\ntogether. For three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in\r\nhand. They have been companions ever. The nation has passed its perils,\r\nand it is free, prosperous, and powerful. The child has reached his\r\nmanhood, his middle age, his old age, and is dead. In all that has\r\nconcerned the nation the man ever sympathized; and now the nation mourns\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nThe day after his death one of the public journals, opposed to him\r\npolitically, held the following pathetic and beautiful language, which I\r\nadopt partly because such high and exclusive eulogy, originating with a\r\npolitical friend, might offend good taste, but chiefly because I could not\r\nin any language of my own so well express my thoughts:\r\n\r\n\"Alas, who can realize that Henry Clay is dead! Who can realize that never\r\nagain that majestic form shall rise in the council-chambers of his country\r\nto beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten, or pour the oil of\r\npeace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around! Who\r\ncan realize that the workings of that mighty mind have ceased, that the\r\nthrobbings of that gallant heart are stilled, that the mighty sweep of\r\nthat graceful arm will be felt no more, and the magic of that eloquent\r\ntongue, which spake as spake no other tongue besides, is hushed hushed for\r\never! Who can realize that freedom's champion, the champion of a civilized\r\nworld and of all tongues and kindreds of people, has indeed fallen! Alas,\r\nin those dark hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced, and\r\nwhich she may be called to experience again, to whom now may her people\r\nlook up for that counsel and advice which only wisdom and experience and\r\npatriotism can give, and which only the undoubting confidence of a nation\r\nwill receive? Perchance in the whole circle of the great and gifted of\r\nour land there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of\r\nthe departed statesman may fall; one who while we now write is doubtless\r\npouring his tears over the bier of his brother and friend brother, friend,\r\never, yet in political sentiment as far apart as party could make them.\r\nAh, it is at times like these that the petty distinctions of mere party\r\ndisappear. We see only the great, the grand, the noble features of the\r\ndeparted statesman; and we do not even beg permission to bow at his\r\nfeet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political\r\nadherents--we do [not] beg this permission, we claim it as a right, though\r\nwe feel it as a privilege. Henry Clay belonged to his country--to the\r\nworld; mere party cannot claim men like him. His career has been national,\r\nhis fame has filled the earth, his memory will endure to the last syllable\r\nof recorded time.\r\n\r\n\"Henry Clay is dead! He breathed his last on yesterday, at twenty minutes\r\nafter eleven, in his chamber at Washington. To those who followed his lead\r\nin public affairs, it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy\r\nand pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious dead. But all\r\nAmericans may show the grief which his death inspires, for his character\r\nand fame are national property. As on a question of liberty he knew no\r\nNorth, no South, no East, no West, but only the Union which held them all\r\nin its sacred circle, so now his countrymen will know no grief that is not\r\nas wide-spread as the bounds of the confederacy. The career of Henry Clay\r\nwas a public career. From his youth he has been devoted to the public\r\nservice, at a period, too, in the world's history justly regarded as a\r\nremarkable era in human affairs. He witnessed in the beginning the throes\r\nof the French Revolution. He saw the rise and fall of Napoleon. He was\r\ncalled upon to legislate for America and direct her policy when all Europe\r\nwas the battlefield of contending dynasties, and when the struggle for\r\nsupremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations. His voice spoke\r\nwar and peace in the contest with Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"When Greece rose against the Turks and struck for liberty, his name was\r\nmingled with the battle-cry of freedom. When South America threw off the\r\nthraldom of Spain, his speeches were read at the head of her armies by\r\nBolivar. His name has been, and will continue to be, hallowed in two\r\nhemispheres, for it is\r\n\r\n     \"'One of the few, the immortal names\r\n      That were not born to die!'\r\n\r\n\"To the ardent patriot and profound statesman he added a quality possessed\r\nby few of the gifted on earth. His eloquence has not been surpassed. In\r\nthe effective power to move the heart of man, Clay was without an equal,\r\nand the heaven-born endowment, in the spirit of its origin, has been\r\nmost conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud. On at least three\r\nimportant occasions he has quelled our civil commotions by a power and\r\ninfluence which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times. And\r\nin our last internal discord, when this Union trembled to its centre, in\r\nold age he left the shades of private life, and gave the death-blow to\r\nfraternal strife, with the vigor of his earlier years, in a series\r\nof senatorial efforts which in themselves would bring immortality by\r\nchallenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age. He\r\nexorcised the demon which possessed the body politic, and gave peace to a\r\ndistracted land. Alas! the achievement cost him his life. He sank day by\r\nday to the tomb his pale but noble brow bound with a triple wreath, put\r\nthere by a grateful country. May his ashes rest in peace, while his spirit\r\ngoes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it is customary and proper upon occasions like the present to give\r\na brief sketch of the life of the deceased, in the case of Mr. Clay it is\r\nless necessary than most others; for his biography has been written and\r\nrewritten and read and reread for the last twenty-five years; so that,\r\nwith the exception of a few of the latest incidents of his life, all is\r\nas well known as it can be. The short sketch which I give is, therefore,\r\nmerely to maintain the connection of this discourse.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay was born on the twelfth day of April, 1777, in Hanover County,\r\nVirginia. Of his father, who died in the fourth or fifth year of Henry's\r\nage, little seems to be known, except that he was a respectable man and\r\na preacher of the Baptist persuasion. Mr. Clay's education to the end of\r\nlife was comparatively limited. I say \"to the end of life,\" because I\r\nhave understood that from time to time he added something to his education\r\nduring the greater part of his whole life. Mr. Clay's lack of a more\r\nperfect early education, however it may be regretted generally, teaches\r\nat least one profitable lesson: it teaches that in this country one\r\ncan scarcely be so poor but that, if he will, he can acquire sufficient\r\neducation to get through the world respectably. In his twenty-third\r\nyear Mr. Clay was licensed to practise law, and emigrated to Lexington,\r\nKentucky. Here he commenced and continued the practice till the year\r\n1803, when he was first elected to the Kentucky Legislature. By successive\r\nelections he was continued in the Legislature till the latter part of\r\n1806, when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in the\r\nUnited States Senate. In 1807 he was again elected to the Kentucky House\r\nof Representatives, and by that body chosen Speaker. In 1808 he was\r\nre-elected to the same body. In 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancy\r\nof two years in the United States Senate. In 1811 he was elected to the\r\nUnited States House of Representatives, and on the first day of taking his\r\nseat in that body he was chosen its Speaker. In 1813 he was again elected\r\nSpeaker. Early in 1814, being the period of our last British war, Mr. Clay\r\nwas sent as commissioner, with others, to negotiate a treaty of peace,\r\nwhich treaty was concluded in the latter part of the same year. On his\r\nreturn from Europe he was again elected to the lower branch of Congress,\r\nand on taking his seat in December, 1815, was called to his old post-the\r\nSpeaker's chair, a position in which he was retained by successive\r\nelections, with one brief intermission, till the inauguration of John\r\nQuincy Adams, in March, 1825. He was then appointed Secretary of State,\r\nand occupied that important station till the inauguration of General\r\nJackson, in March, 1829. After this he returned to Kentucky, resumed the\r\npractice of law, and continued it till the autumn of 1831, when he was by\r\nthe Legislature of Kentucky again placed in the United States Senate. By\r\na reelection he was continued in the Senate till he resigned his seat and\r\nretired, in March, 1848. In December, 1849, he again took his seat in the\r\nSenate, which he again resigned only a few months before his death.\r\n\r\nBy the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the beginning of Mr.\r\nClay's official life in 1803 to the end of 1852 is but one year short\r\nof half a century, and that the sum of all the intervals in it will not\r\namount to ten years. But mere duration of time in office constitutes the\r\nsmallest part of Mr. Clay's history. Throughout that long period he has\r\nconstantly been the most loved and most implicitly followed by friends,\r\nand the most dreaded by opponents, of all living American politicians. In\r\nall the great questions which have agitated the country, and particularly\r\nin those fearful crises, the Missouri question, the nullification\r\nquestion, and the late slavery question, as connected with the newly\r\nacquired territory, involving and endangering the stability of the Union,\r\nhis has been the leading and most conspicuous part. In 1824 he was first\r\na candidate for the Presidency, and was defeated; and, although he was\r\nsuccessively defeated for the same office in 1832 and in 1844, there has\r\nnever been a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion\r\nof the American people did not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and\r\npurpose of still elevating him to the Presidency. With other men, to\r\nbe defeated was to be forgotten; but with him defeat was but a trifling\r\nincident, neither changing him nor the world's estimate of him. Even those\r\nof both political parties who have been preferred to him for the highest\r\noffice have run far briefer courses than he, and left him still shining\r\nhigh in the heavens of the political world. Jackson, Van Buren, Harnson,\r\nPolk, and Taylor all rose after, and set long before him. The spell--the\r\nlong-enduring spell--with which the souls of men were bound to him is a\r\nmiracle. Who can compass it? It is probably true he owed his pre-eminence\r\nto no one quality, but to a fortunate combination of several. He was\r\nsurpassingly eloquent; but many eloquent men fail utterly, and they are\r\nnot, as a class, generally successful. His judgment was excellent;\r\nbut many men of good judgment live and die unnoticed. His will was\r\nindomitable; but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better\r\nthan a character for useless obstinacy. These, then, were Mr. Clay's\r\nleading qualities. No one of them is very uncommon; but all together are\r\nrarely combined in a single individual, and this is probably the reason\r\nwhy such men as Henry Clay are so rare in the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay's eloquence did not consist, as many fine specimens of eloquence\r\ndo, of types and figures, of antithesis and elegant arrangement of words\r\nand sentences, but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone\r\nand manner which can proceed only from great sincerity, and a thorough\r\nconviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause. This\r\nit is that truly touches the chords of sympathy; and those who heard\r\nMr. Clay never failed to be moved by it, or ever afterward forgot the\r\nimpression. All his efforts were made for practical effect. He never spoke\r\nmerely to be heard. He never delivered a Fourth of July oration, or a\r\neulogy on an occasion like this. As a politician or statesman, no one was\r\nso habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground. Whatever he did he\r\ndid for the whole country. In the construction of his measures, he\r\never carefully surveyed every part of the field, and duly weighed every\r\nconflicting interest. Feeling as he did, and as the truth surely is, that\r\nthe world's best hope depended on the continued union of these States,\r\nhe was ever jealous of and watchful for whatever might have the slightest\r\ntendency to separate them.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay's predominant sentiment, from first to last, was a deep devotion\r\nto the cause of human liberty--a strong sympathy with the oppressed\r\neverywhere, and an ardent wish for their elevation. With him this was a\r\nprimary and all-controlling passion. Subsidiary to this was the conduct\r\nof his whole life. He loved his country partly because it was his own\r\ncountry, and mostly because it was a free country; and he burned with a\r\nzeal for its advancement, prosperity, and glory, because he saw in such\r\nthe advancement, prosperity, and glory of human liberty, human right, and\r\nhuman nature. He desired the prosperity of his countrymen, partly because\r\nthey were his countrymen, but chiefly to show to the world that free men\r\ncould be prosperous.\r\n\r\nThat his views and measures were always the wisest needs not to be\r\naffirmed; nor should it be on this occasion, where so many thinking\r\ndifferently join in doing honor to his memory. A free people in times of\r\npeace and quiet when pressed by no common danger-naturally divide into\r\nparties. At such times the man who is of neither party is not, cannot be,\r\nof any consequence. Mr. Clay therefore was of a party. Taking a prominent\r\npart, as he did, in all the great political questions of his country for\r\nthe last half century, the wisdom of his course on many is doubted and\r\ndenied by a large portion of his countrymen; and of such it is not now\r\nproper to speak particularly. But there are many others, about his course\r\nupon which there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and\r\npatriotic Americans. Of these last are the War of 1812, the Missouri\r\nquestion, nullification, and the now recent compromise measures. In 1812\r\nMr. Clay, though not unknown, was still a young man. Whether we should\r\ngo to war with Great Britain being the question of the day, a minority\r\nopposed the declaration of war by Congress, while the majority, though\r\napparently inclined to war, had for years wavered, and hesitated to act\r\ndecisively. Meanwhile British aggressions multiplied, and grew more daring\r\nand aggravated. By Mr. Clay more than any other man the struggle was\r\nbrought to a decision in Congress. The question, being now fully before\r\nCongress, came up in a variety of ways in rapid succession, on most of\r\nwhich occasions Mr. Clay spoke. Adding to all the logic of which the\r\nsubject was susceptible that noble inspiration which came to him as it\r\ncame to no other, he aroused and nerved and inspired his friends, and\r\nconfounded and bore down all opposition. Several of his speeches on these\r\noccasions were reported and are still extant, but the best of them all\r\nnever was. During its delivery the reporters forgot their vocation,\r\ndropped their pens, and sat enchanted from near the beginning to quite the\r\nclose. The speech now lives only in the memory of a few old men, and the\r\nenthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely\r\nastonishing. The precise language of this speech we shall never know; but\r\nwe do know we cannot help knowing--that with deep pathos it pleaded the\r\ncause of the injured sailor, that it invoked the genius of the Revolution,\r\nthat it apostrophized the names of Otis, of Henry, and of Washington, that\r\nit appealed to the interests, the pride, the honor, and the glory of\r\nthe nation, that it shamed and taunted the timidity of friends, that it\r\nscorned and scouted and withered the temerity of domestic foes, that\r\nit bearded and defied the British lion, and, rising and swelling and\r\nmaddening in its course, it sounded the onset, till the charge, the shock,\r\nthe steady struggle, and the glorious victory all passed in vivid review\r\nbefore the entranced hearers.\r\n\r\nImportant and exciting as was the war question of 1812, it never so\r\nalarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of the\r\nRepublic as afterward did the Missouri question. This sprang from\r\nthat unfortunate source of discord--negro slavery. When our Federal\r\nConstitution was adopted, we owned no territory beyond the limits or\r\nownership of the States, except the territory northwest of the River Ohio\r\nand east of the Mississippi. What has since been formed into the States\r\nof Maine, Kentucky and Tennessee, was, I believe, within the limits of\r\nor owned by Massachusetts, Virginia, and North Carolina. As to the\r\nNorthwestern Territory, provision had been made even before the adoption\r\nof the Constitution that slavery should never go there. On the admission\r\nof States into the Union, carved from the territory we owned before the\r\nConstitution, no question, or at most no considerable question, arose\r\nabout slavery--those which were within the limits of or owned by the old\r\nStates following respectively the condition of the parent State, and those\r\nwithin the Northwest Territory following the previously made provision.\r\nBut in 1803 we purchased Louisiana of the French, and it included with\r\nmuch more what has since been formed into the State of Missouri. With\r\nregard to it, nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery.\r\nWhen, therefore, in 1819, Missouri, having formed a State constitution\r\nwithout excluding slavery, and with slavery already actually existing\r\nwithin its limits, knocked at the door of the Union for admission, almost\r\nthe entire representation of the non-slaveholding States objected. A\r\nfearful and angry struggle instantly followed. This alarmed thinking\r\nmen more than any previous question, because, unlike all the former,\r\nit divided the country by geographical lines. Other questions had their\r\nopposing partisans in all localities of the country and in almost every\r\nfamily, so that no division of the Union could follow such without a\r\nseparation of friends to quite as great an extent as that of opponents.\r\nNot so with the Missouri question. On this a geographical line could be\r\ntraced, which in the main would separate opponents only. This was the\r\ndanger. Mr. Jefferson, then in retirement, wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I had for a long time ceased to read newspapers or to pay any attention\r\nto public affairs, confident they were in good hands and content to be a\r\npassenger in our bark to the shore from which I am not distant. But this\r\nmomentous question, like a firebell in the night, awakened and filled\r\nme with terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. It is\r\nhushed, indeed, for the moment. But this is a reprieve only, not a final\r\nsentence. A geographical line coinciding with a marked principle, moral\r\nand political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men,\r\nwill never be obliterated, and every irritation will mark it deeper and\r\ndeeper. I can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth\r\nwho would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy\r\nreproach in any practicable way.\r\n\r\n\"The cession of that kind of property--for it is so misnamed--is a\r\nbagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a\r\ngeneral emancipation and expatriation could be effected, and gradually and\r\nwith due sacrifices I think it might be. But as it is, we have the wolf by\r\nthe ears, and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go. Justice is in\r\none scale, and self-preservation in the other.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clay was in Congress, and, perceiving the danger, at once engaged his\r\nwhole energies to avert it. It began, as I have said, in 1819; and it did\r\nnot terminate till 1821. Missouri would not yield the point; and Congress\r\nthat is, a majority in Congress--by repeated votes showed a determination\r\nnot to admit the State unless it should yield. After several failures,\r\nand great labor on the part of Mr. Clay to so present the question that a\r\nmajority could consent to the admission, it was by a vote rejected, and,\r\nas all seemed to think, finally. A sullen gloom hung over the nation. All\r\nfelt that the rejection of Missouri was equivalent to a dissolution of the\r\nUnion, because those States which already had what Missouri was rejected\r\nfor refusing to relinquish would go with Missouri. All deprecated and\r\ndeplored this, but none saw how to avert it. For the judgment of members\r\nto be convinced of the necessity of yielding was not the whole difficulty;\r\neach had a constituency to meet and to answer to. Mr. Clay, though worn\r\ndown and exhausted, was appealed to by members to renew his efforts at\r\ncompromise. He did so, and by some judicious modifications of his plan,\r\ncoupled with laborious efforts with individual members and his own\r\novermastering eloquence upon that floor, he finally secured the admission\r\nof the State. Brightly and captivating as it had previously shown, it was\r\nnow perceived that his great eloquence was a mere embellishment, or at\r\nmost but a helping hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his\r\ncountry in the day of her extreme peril.\r\n\r\nAfter the settlement of the Missouri question, although a portion of the\r\nAmerican people have differed with Mr. Clay, and a majority even\r\nappear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary\r\nadministration, he seems constantly to have been regarded by all as the\r\nman for the crisis. Accordingly, in the days of nullification, and more\r\nrecently in the reappearance of the slavery question connected with\r\nour territory newly acquired of Mexico, the task of devising a mode of\r\nadjustment seems to have been cast upon Mr. Clay by common consent--and\r\nhis performance of the task in each case was little else than a literal\r\nfulfilment of the public expectation.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay's efforts in behalf of the South Americans, and afterward in\r\nbehalf of the Greeks, in the times of their respective struggles for civil\r\nliberty, are among the finest on record, upon the noblest of all themes,\r\nand bear ample corroboration of what I have said was his ruling passion--a\r\nlove of liberty and right, unselfishly, and for their own sakes.\r\n\r\nHaving been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already, I am\r\nunwilling to close without referring more particularly to Mr. Clay's\r\nviews and conduct in regard to it. He ever was on principle and in feeling\r\nopposed to slavery. The very earliest, and one of the latest, public\r\nefforts of his life, separated by a period of more than fifty years, were\r\nboth made in favor of gradual emancipation. He did not perceive that on\r\na question of human right the negroes were to be excepted from the human\r\nrace. And yet Mr. Clay was the owner of slaves. Cast into life when\r\nslavery was already widely spread and deeply seated, he did not perceive,\r\nas I think no wise man has perceived, how it could be at once eradicated\r\nwithout producing a greater evil even to the cause of human liberty\r\nitself. His feeling and his judgment, therefore, ever led him to oppose\r\nboth extremes of opinion on the subject. Those who would shiver into\r\nfragments the Union of these States, tear to tatters its now venerated\r\nConstitution, and even burn the last copy of the Bible, rather than\r\nslavery should continue a single hour, together with all their more\r\nhalting sympathizers, have received, and are receiving, their just\r\nexecration; and the name and opinions and influence of Mr. Clay are fully\r\nand, as I trust, effectually and enduringly arrayed against them. But I\r\nwould also, if I could, array his name, opinions, and influence against\r\nthe opposite extreme--against a few but an increasing number of men who,\r\nfor the sake of perpetuating slavery, are beginning to assail and to\r\nridicule the white man's charter of freedom, the declaration that \"all men\r\nare created free and equal.\" So far as I have learned, the first American\r\nof any note to do or attempt this was the late John C. Calhoun; and if I\r\nmistake not, it soon after found its way into some of the messages of the\r\nGovernor of South Carolina. We, however, look for and are not much shocked\r\nby political eccentricities and heresies in South Carolina. But only\r\nlast year I saw with astonishment what purported to be a letter of a very\r\ndistinguished and influential clergyman of Virginia, copied, with apparent\r\napprobation, into a St. Louis newspaper, containing the following to me\r\nvery unsatisfactory language:\r\n\r\n\"I am fully aware that there is a text in some Bibles that is not in mine.\r\nProfessional abolitionists have made more use of it than of any passage in\r\nthe Bible. It came, however, as I trace it, from Saint Voltaire, and was\r\nbaptized by Thomas Jefferson, and since almost universally regarded as\r\ncanonical authority`All men are born free and equal.'\r\n\r\n\"This is a genuine coin in the political currency of our generation. I am\r\nsorry to say that I have never seen two men of whom it is true. But I must\r\nadmit I never saw the Siamese Twins, and therefore will not dogmatically\r\nsay that no man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism.\"\r\n\r\nThis sounds strangely in republican America. The like was not heard in the\r\nfresher days of the republic. Let us contrast with it the language of that\r\ntruly national man whose life and death we now commemorate and lament: I\r\nquote from a speech of Mr. Clay delivered before the American Colonization\r\nSociety in 1827:\r\n\r\n\"We are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation of this question.\r\nThe society goes into no household to disturb its domestic tranquillity.\r\nIt addresses itself to no slaves to weaken their obligations of obedience.\r\nIt seeks to affect no man's property. It neither has the power nor the\r\nwill to affect the property of any one contrary to his consent. The\r\nexecution of its scheme would augment instead of diminishing the value of\r\nproperty left behind. The society, composed of free men, conceals itself\r\nonly with the free. Collateral consequences we are not responsible for.\r\nIt is not this society which has produced the great moral revolution which\r\nthe age exhibits. What would they who thus reproach us have done? If they\r\nwould repress all tendencies toward liberty and ultimate emancipation,\r\nthey must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of this society.\r\nThey must go back to the era of our liberty and independence, and muzzle\r\nthe cannon which thunders its annual joyous return. They must renew the\r\nslave trade, with all its train of atrocities. They must suppress the\r\nworkings of British philanthropy, seeking to meliorate the condition of\r\nthe unfortunate West Indian slave. They must arrest the career of South\r\nAmerican deliverance from thraldom. They must blow out the moral lights\r\naround us and extinguish that greatest torch of all which America presents\r\nto a benighted world--pointing the way to their rights, their liberties,\r\nand their happiness. And when they have achieved all those purposes their\r\nwork will be yet incomplete. They must penetrate the human soul, and\r\neradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty. Then, and not till\r\nthen, when universal darkness and despair prevail, can you perpetuate\r\nslavery and repress all sympathy and all humane and benevolent efforts\r\namong free men in behalf of the unhappy portion of our race doomed to\r\nbondage.\"\r\n\r\nThe American Colonization Society was organized in 1816. Mr. Clay, though\r\nnot its projector, was one of its earliest members; and he died, as for\r\nmany preceding years he had been, its president. It was one of the\r\nmost cherished objects of his direct care and consideration, and the\r\nassociation of his name with it has probably been its very greatest\r\ncollateral support. He considered it no demerit in the society that it\r\ntended to relieve the slave-holders from the troublesome presence of\r\nthe free negroes; but this was far from being its whole merit in his\r\nestimation. In the same speech from which we have quoted he says:\r\n\r\n\"There is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to Africa her children,\r\nwhose ancestors have been torn from her by the ruthless hand of fraud and\r\nviolence. Transplanted in a foreign land, they will carry back to their\r\nnative soil the rich fruits of religion, civilization, law, and liberty.\r\nMay it not be one of the great designs of the Ruler of the universe, whose\r\nways are often inscrutable by short-sighted mortals, thus to transform an\r\noriginal crime into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of\r\nthe globe?\"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the African race\r\nand African continent was made twenty-five years ago. Every succeeding\r\nyear has added strength to the hope of its realization. May it indeed be\r\nrealized. Pharaoh's country was cursed with plagues, and his hosts were\r\nlost in the Red Sea, for striving to retain a captive people who had\r\nalready served them more than four hundred years. May like disasters never\r\nbefall us! If, as the friends of colonization hope, the present and coming\r\ngenerations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in freeing our\r\nland from the dangerous presence of slavery, and at the same time in\r\nrestoring a captive people to their long-lost fatherland with bright\r\nprospects for the future, and this too so gradually that neither races\r\nnor individuals shall have suffered by the change, it will indeed be a\r\nglorious consummation. And if to such a consummation the efforts of Mr.\r\nClay shall have contributed, it will be what he most ardently wished, and\r\nnone of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nBut Henry Clay is dead. His long and eventful life is closed. Our country\r\nis prosperous and powerful; but could it have been quite all it has\r\nbeen, and is, and is to be, without Henry Clay? Such a man the times have\r\ndemanded, and such in the providence of God was given us. But he is gone.\r\nLet us strive to deserve, as far as mortals may, the continued care of\r\nDivine Providence, trusting that in future national emergencies He will\r\nnot fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security.\r\n\r\nNOTE.

We have examined the present constitution of the\r\nState, the election law of 1849, and the unrepealed parts of the election\r\nlaw in the revised code of 1845; and we are of the opinion that any person\r\ntaking the oath prescribed in the act of 1849 is entitled to vote unless\r\ncounter-proof be made satisfactory to a majority of the judges that such\r\noath is untrue; and that for the purpose of obtaining such counter-proof,\r\nthe proposed voter may be asked questions in the way of cross-examination,\r\nand other independent testimony may be received. We base our opinion as\r\nto receiving counter-proof upon the unrepealed Section nineteen of the\r\nelection law in the revised code.\r\n\r\n\r\n   A. LINCOLN,\r\n   B. S. EDWARDS\r\n   S. T.

STANFORD.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I hope the subject-matter of this letter will appear a sufficient\r\napology to you for the liberty I, a total stranger, take in addressing\r\nyou. The persons here holding two lots under a conveyance made by you, as\r\nthe attorney of Daniel M. Baily, now nearly twenty-two years ago, are in\r\ngreat danger of losing the lots, and very much, perhaps all, is to depend\r\non the testimony you give as to whether you did or did not account to\r\nBaily for the proceeds received by you on this sale of the lots. I,\r\ntherefore, as one of the counsel, beg of you to fully refresh your\r\nrecollection by any means in your power before the time you may be called\r\non to testify. If persons should come about you, and show a disposition to\r\npump you on the subject, it may be no more than prudent to remember that\r\nit may be possible they design to misrepresent you and embarrass the real\r\ntestimony you may ultimately give. It may be six months or a year before\r\nyou are called on to testify.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1854\r\n\r\nTO O. L. DAVIS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 22, 1854.\r\n\r\nO. L. DAVIS, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--You, no doubt, remember the enclosed memorandum being handed me\r\nin your office. I have just made the desired search, and find that no such\r\ndeed has ever been here. Campbell, the auditor, says that if it were here,\r\nit would be in his office, and that he has hunted for it a dozen times,\r\nand could never find it. He says that one time and another, he has heard\r\nmuch about the matter, that it was not a deed for Right of Way, but a\r\ndeed, outright, for Depot-ground--at least, a sale for Depot-ground, and\r\nthere may never have been a deed. He says, if there is a deed, it is most\r\nprobable General Alexander, of Paris, has it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA MEASURE\r\n\r\nTO J. M. PALMER\r\n\r\n[Confidential]\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Sept. 7, 1854.\r\n\r\nHON. J. M. PALMER.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--You know how anxious I am that this Nebraska measure shall be\r\nrebuked and condemned everywhere. Of course I hope something from your\r\nposition; yet I do not expect you to do anything which may be wrong in\r\nyour own judgment; nor would I have you do anything personally injurious\r\nto yourself. You are, and always have been, honestly and sincerely a\r\nDemocrat; and I know how painful it must be to an honest, sincere man to\r\nbe urged by his party to the support of a measure which in his conscience\r\nhe believes to be wrong. You have had a severe struggle with yourself, and\r\nyou have determined not to swallow the wrong. Is it not just to yourself\r\nthat you should, in a few public speeches, state your reasons, and thus\r\njustify yourself? I wish you would; and yet I say, don't do it, if you\r\nthink it will injure you. You may have given your word to vote for Major\r\nHarris; and if so, of course you will stick to it. But allow me to suggest\r\nthat you should avoid speaking of this; for it probably would induce some\r\nof your friends in like manner to cast their votes. You understand. And\r\nnow let me beg your pardon for obtruding this letter upon you, to whom\r\nI have ever been opposed in politics. Had your party omitted to make\r\nNebraska a test of party fidelity, you probably would have been the\r\nDemocratic candidate for Congress in the district. You deserved it, and\r\nI believe it would have been given you. In that case I should have been\r\nquite happy that Nebraska was to be rebuked at all events. I still should\r\nhave voted for the Whig candidate; but I should have made no speeches,\r\nwritten no letters; and you would have been elected by at least a thousand\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. B. MOREAU.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, September 7, 1854\r\n\r\nA. B. MOREAU, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Stranger though I am, personally, being a brother in the faith, I\r\nventure to write you. Yates can not come to your court next week. He\r\nis obliged to be at Pike court where he has a case, with a fee of five\r\nhundred dollars, two hundred dollars already paid. To neglect it would be\r\nunjust to himself, and dishonest to his client. Harris will be with you,\r\nhead up and tail up, for Nebraska. You must have some one to make an\r\nanti-Nebraska speech. Palmer is the best, if you can get him, I think. Jo.\r\nGillespie, if you can not get Palmer, and somebody anyhow, if you can\r\nget neither. But press Palmer hard. It is in his Senatorial district, I\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nYours etc.,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO SENATOR DOUGLAS--PEORIA SPEECH\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT PEORIA, ILLINOIS, IN REPLY TO SENATOR DOUGLAS,\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 16, 1854.\r\n\r\nI do not rise to speak now, if I can stipulate with the audience to meet\r\nme here at half-past six or at seven o'clock. It is now several minutes\r\npast five, and Judge Douglas has spoken over three hours. If you hear me\r\nat all, I wish you to hear me through. It will take me as long as it has\r\ntaken him. That will carry us beyond eight o'clock at night. Now, every\r\none of you who can remain that long can just as well get his supper,\r\nmeet me at seven, and remain an hour or two later. The Judge has already\r\ninformed you that he is to have an hour to reply to me. I doubt not but\r\nyou have been a little surprised to learn that I have consented to give\r\none of his high reputation and known ability this advantage of me. Indeed,\r\nmy consenting to it, though reluctant, was not wholly unselfish, for I\r\nsuspected, if it were understood that the Judge was entirely done, you\r\nDemocrats would leave and not hear me; but by giving him the close, I felt\r\nconfident you would stay for the fun of hearing him skin me.\r\n\r\nThe audience signified their assent to the arrangement, and adjourned to\r\nseven o'clock P.M., at which time they reassembled, and Mr. Lincoln spoke\r\nsubstantially as follows:\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and the propriety of its\r\nrestoration, constitute the subject of what I am about to say. As I desire\r\nto present my own connected view of this subject, my remarks will not\r\nbe specifically an answer to Judge Douglas; yet, as I proceed, the main\r\npoints he has presented will arise, and will receive such respectful\r\nattention as I may be able to give them. I wish further to say that I do\r\nnot propose to question the patriotism or to assail the motives of any man\r\nor class of men, but rather to confine myself strictly to the naked\r\nmerits of the question. I also wish to be no less than national in all\r\nthe positions I may take, and whenever I take ground which others have\r\nthought, or may think, narrow, sectional, and dangerous to the Union, I\r\nhope to give a reason which will appear sufficient, at least to some, why\r\nI think differently.\r\n\r\nAnd as this subject is no other than part and parcel of the larger general\r\nquestion of domestic slavery, I wish to make and to keep the distinction\r\nbetween the existing institution and the extension of it so broad and\r\nso clear that no honest man can misunderstand me, and no dishonest one\r\nsuccessfully misrepresent me.\r\n\r\nIn order to a clear understanding of what the Missouri Compromise is, a\r\nshort history of the preceding kindred subjects will perhaps be proper.\r\n\r\nWhen we established our independence, we did not own or claim the\r\ncountry to which this compromise applies. Indeed, strictly speaking, the\r\nConfederacy then owned no country at all; the States respectively owned\r\nthe country within their limits, and some of them owned territory\r\nbeyond their strict State limits. Virginia thus owned the Northwestern\r\nTerritory--the country out of which the principal part of Ohio, all\r\nIndiana, all Illinois, all Michigan, and all Wisconsin have since been\r\nformed. She also owned (perhaps within her then limits) what has since\r\nbeen formed into the State of Kentucky. North Carolina thus owned what\r\nis now the State of Tennessee; and South Carolina and Georgia owned,\r\nin separate parts, what are now Mississippi and Alabama. Connecticut, I\r\nthink, owned the little remaining part of Ohio, being the same where they\r\nnow send Giddings to Congress and beat all creation in making cheese.\r\n\r\nThese territories, together with the States themselves, constitute all the\r\ncountry over which the Confederacy then claimed any sort of jurisdiction.\r\nWe were then living under the Articles of Confederation, which were\r\nsuperseded by the Constitution several years afterward. The question of\r\nceding the territories to the General Government was set on foot. Mr.\r\nJefferson,--the author of the Declaration of Independence, and otherwise\r\na chief actor in the Revolution; then a delegate in Congress; afterward,\r\ntwice President; who was, is, and perhaps will continue to be, the\r\nmost distinguished politician of our history; a Virginian by birth and\r\ncontinued residence, and withal a slaveholder,--conceived the idea of\r\ntaking that occasion to prevent slavery ever going into the Northwestern\r\nTerritory. He prevailed on the Virginia Legislature to adopt his views,\r\nand to cede the Territory, making the prohibition of slavery therein\r\na condition of the deed. (Jefferson got only an understanding, not a\r\ncondition of the deed to this wish.) Congress accepted the cession with\r\nthe condition; and the first ordinance (which the acts of Congress were\r\nthen called) for the government of the Territory provided that slavery\r\nshould never be permitted therein. This is the famed \"Ordinance of '87,\"\r\nso often spoken of.\r\n\r\nThenceforward for sixty-one years, and until, in 1848, the last scrap of\r\nthis Territory came into the Union as the State of Wisconsin, all parties\r\nacted in quiet obedience to this ordinance. It is now what Jefferson\r\nforesaw and intended--the happy home of teeming millions of free, white,\r\nprosperous people, and no slave among them.\r\n\r\nThus, with the author of the Declaration of Independence, the policy of\r\nprohibiting slavery in new territory originated. Thus, away back to the\r\nConstitution, in the pure, fresh, free breath of the Revolution, the State\r\nof Virginia and the national Congress put that policy into practice. Thus,\r\nthrough more than sixty of the best years of the republic, did that policy\r\nsteadily work to its great and beneficent end. And thus, in those five\r\nStates, and in five millions of free, enterprising people, we have before\r\nus the rich fruits of this policy.\r\n\r\nBut now new light breaks upon us. Now Congress declares this ought never\r\nto have been, and the like of it must never be again. The sacred right of\r\nself-government is grossly violated by it. We even find some men who drew\r\ntheir first breath--and every other breath of their lives--under this very\r\nrestriction, now live in dread of absolute suffocation if they should\r\nbe restricted in the \"sacred right\" of taking slaves to Nebraska. That\r\nperfect liberty they sigh for--the liberty of making slaves of other\r\npeople, Jefferson never thought of, their own fathers never thought of,\r\nthey never thought of themselves, a year ago. How fortunate for them they\r\ndid not sooner become sensible of their great misery! Oh, how difficult it\r\nis to treat with respect such assaults upon all we have ever really held\r\nsacred!\r\n\r\nBut to return to history. In 1803 we purchased what was then called\r\nLouisiana, of France. It included the present States of Louisiana,\r\nArkansas, Missouri, and Iowa; also the Territory of Minnesota, and the\r\npresent bone of contention, Kansas and Nebraska. Slavery already existed\r\namong the French at New Orleans, and to some extent at St. Louis. In 1812\r\nLouisiana came into the Union as a slave State, without controversy. In\r\n1818 or '19, Missouri showed signs of a wish to come in with slavery. This\r\nwas resisted by Northern members of Congress; and thus began the first\r\ngreat slavery agitation in the nation. This controversy lasted several\r\nmonths, and became very angry and exciting--the House of Representatives\r\nvoting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in Missouri, and the Senate\r\nvoting as steadily against it. Threats of the breaking up of the Union\r\nwere freely made, and the ablest public men of the day became seriously\r\nalarmed. At length a compromise was made, in which, as in all compromises,\r\nboth sides yielded something. It was a law, passed on the 6th of March,\r\n1820, providing that Missouri might come into the Union with slavery, but\r\nthat in all the remaining part of the territory purchased of France\r\nwhich lies north of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north latitude,\r\nslavery should never be permitted. This provision of law is the \"Missouri\r\nCompromise.\" In excluding slavery north of the line, the same language\r\nis employed as in the Ordinance of 1787. It directly applied to Iowa,\r\nMinnesota, and to the present bone of contention, Kansas and Nebraska.\r\nWhether there should or should not be slavery south of that line, nothing\r\nwas said in the law. But Arkansas constituted the principal remaining\r\npart south of the line; and it has since been admitted as a slave State,\r\nwithout serious controversy. More recently, Iowa, north of the line, came\r\nin as a free State without controversy. Still later, Minnesota, north\r\nof the line, had a territorial organization without controversy. Texas,\r\nprincipally south of the line, and west of Arkansas, though originally\r\nwithin the purchase from France, had, in 1819, been traded off to Spain\r\nin our treaty for the acquisition of Florida. It had thus become a part\r\nof Mexico. Mexico revolutionized and became independent of Spain. American\r\ncitizens began settling rapidly with their slaves in the southern part\r\nof Texas. Soon they revolutionized against Mexico, and established an\r\nindependent government of their own, adopting a constitution with slavery,\r\nstrongly resembling the constitutions of our slave States. By still\r\nanother rapid move, Texas, claiming a boundary much farther west than when\r\nwe parted with her in 1819, was brought back to the United States, and\r\nadmitted into the Union as a slave State. Then there was little or no\r\nsettlement in the northern part of Texas, a considerable portion of which\r\nlay north of the Missouri line; and in the resolutions admitting her into\r\nthe Union, the Missouri restriction was expressly extended westward across\r\nher territory. This was in 1845, only nine years ago.\r\n\r\nThus originated the Missouri Compromise; and thus has it been respected\r\ndown to 1845. And even four years later, in 1849, our distinguished\r\nSenator, in a public address, held the following language in relation to\r\nit:\r\n\r\n\"The Missouri Compromise has been in practical operation for about a\r\nquarter of a century, and has received the sanction and approbation of men\r\nof all parties in every section of the Union. It has allayed all sectional\r\njealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question, and\r\nharmonized and tranquillized the whole country. It has given to Henry\r\nClay, as its prominent champion, the proud sobriquet of the 'Great\r\nPacificator,' and by that title, and for that service, his political\r\nfriends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standard\r\nas a Presidential candidate, as the man who had exhibited the patriotism\r\nand power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation, and preserve\r\nthe Union. He was not aware that any man or any party, from any section\r\nof the Union, had ever urged as an objection to Mr. Clay that he was the\r\ngreat champion of the Missouri Compromise. On the contrary, the effort was\r\nmade by the opponents of Mr. Clay to prove that he was not entitled to the\r\nexclusive merit of that great patriotic measure, and that the honor was\r\nequally due to others, as well as to him, for securing its adoption;\r\nthat it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men, who desired\r\nto preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious Union--an origin\r\nakin to that of the Constitution of the United States, conceived in the\r\nsame spirit of fraternal affection, and calculated to remove forever the\r\nonly danger which seemed to threaten, at some distant day, to sever the\r\nsocial bond of union. All the evidences of public opinion at that day\r\nseemed to indicate that this compromise had been canonized in the hearts\r\nof the American people, as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would\r\never be reckless enough to disturb.\"\r\n\r\nI do not read this extract to involve Judge Douglas in an inconsistency.\r\nIf he afterward thought he had been wrong, it was right for him to change.\r\nI bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the\r\nMissouri Compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849.\r\n\r\nBut going back a little in point of time. Our war with Mexico broke out\r\nin 1846. When Congress was about adjourning that session, President Polk\r\nasked them to place two millions of dollars under his control, to be used\r\nby him in the recess, if found practicable and expedient, in negotiating\r\na treaty of peace with Mexico, and acquiring some part of her territory. A\r\nbill was duly gotten up for the purpose, and was progressing swimmingly in\r\nthe House of Representatives, when a member by the name of David Wilmot, a\r\nDemocrat from Pennsylvania, moved as an amendment, \"Provided, that in any\r\nterritory thus acquired there never shall be slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the origin of the far-famed Wilmot Proviso. It created a great\r\nflutter; but it stuck like wax, was voted into the bill, and the bill\r\npassed with it through the House. The Senate, however, adjourned without\r\nfinal action on it, and so both appropriation and proviso were lost for\r\nthe time. The war continued, and at the next session the President renewed\r\nhis request for the appropriation, enlarging the amount, I think, to\r\nthree millions. Again came the proviso, and defeated the measure. Congress\r\nadjourned again, and the war went on. In December, 1847, the new Congress\r\nassembled. I was in the lower House that term. The Wilmot Proviso, or the\r\nprinciple of it, was constantly coming up in some shape or other, and I\r\nthink I may venture to say I voted for it at least forty times during\r\nthe short time I was there. The Senate, however, held it in check, and it\r\nnever became a law. In the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was made\r\nwith Mexico, by which we obtained that portion of her country which now\r\nconstitutes the Territories of New Mexico and Utah and the present State\r\nof California. By this treaty the Wilmot Proviso was defeated, in so far\r\nas it was intended to be a condition of the acquisition of territory.\r\nIts friends, however, were still determined to find some way to restrain\r\nslavery from getting into the new country. This new acquisition lay\r\ndirectly west of our old purchase from France, and extended west to the\r\nPacific Ocean, and was so situated that if the Missouri line should be\r\nextended straight west, the new country would be divided by such extended\r\nline, leaving some north and some south of it. On Judge Douglas's motion,\r\na bill, or provision of a bill, passed the Senate to so extend the\r\nMissouri line. The proviso men in the House, including myself, voted it\r\ndown, because, by implication, it gave up the southern part to slavery,\r\nwhile we were bent on having it all free.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1848 the gold-mines were discovered in California. This\r\nattracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity, so that on, or soon\r\nafter, the meeting of the new Congress in December, 1849, she already had\r\na population of nearly a hundred thousand, had called a convention, formed\r\na State constitution excluding slavery, and was knocking for admission\r\ninto the Union. The proviso men, of course, were for letting her in,\r\nbut the Senate, always true to the other side, would not consent to her\r\nadmission, and there California stood, kept out of the Union because\r\nshe would not let slavery into her borders. Under all the circumstances,\r\nperhaps, this was not wrong. There were other points of dispute connected\r\nwith the general question of Slavery, which equally needed adjustment. The\r\nSouth clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law. The North clamored\r\nfor the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the District\r\nof Columbia, in connection with which, in view from the windows of the\r\nCapitol, a sort of negro livery-stable, where droves of negroes were\r\ncollected, temporarily kept, and finally taken to Southern markets,\r\nprecisely like droves of horses, had been openly maintained for fifty\r\nyears. Utah and New Mexico needed territorial governments; and whether\r\nslavery should or should not be prohibited within them was another\r\nquestion. The indefinite western boundary of Texas was to be settled. She\r\nwas a slave State, and consequently the farther west the slavery men could\r\npush her boundary, the more slave country they secured; and the farther\r\neast the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back, the less slave\r\nground was secured. Thus this was just as clearly a slavery question as\r\nany of the others.\r\n\r\nThese points all needed adjustment, and they were held up, perhaps wisely,\r\nto make them help adjust one another. The Union now, as in 1820, was\r\nthought to be in danger, and devotion to the Union rightfully inclined\r\nmen to yield somewhat in points where nothing else could have so inclined\r\nthem. A compromise was finally effected. The South got their new fugitive\r\nslave law, and the North got California, (by far the best part of our\r\nacquisition from Mexico) as a free State. The South got a provision that\r\nNew Mexico and Utah, when admitted as States, may come in with or without\r\nslavery as they may then choose; and the North got the slave trade\r\nabolished in the District of Columbia.. The North got the western boundary\r\nof Texas thrown farther back eastward than the South desired; but, in\r\nturn, they gave Texas ten millions of dollars with which to pay her old\r\ndebts. This is the Compromise of 1850.\r\n\r\nPreceding the Presidential election of 1852, each of the great political\r\nparties, Democrats and Whigs, met in convention and adopted resolutions\r\nindorsing the Compromise of '50, as a \"finality,\" a final settlement, so\r\nfar as these parties could make it so, of all slavery agitation. Previous\r\nto this, in 1851, the Illinois Legislature had indorsed it.\r\n\r\nDuring this long period of time, Nebraska (the Nebraska Territory, not\r\nthe State of as we know it now) had remained substantially an uninhabited\r\ncountry, but now emigration to and settlement within it began to take\r\nplace. It is about one third as large as the present United States,\r\nand its importance, so long overlooked, begins to come into view. The\r\nrestriction of slavery by the Missouri Compromise directly applies to\r\nit--in fact was first made, and has since been maintained expressly for\r\nit. In 1853, a bill to give it a territorial government passed the House\r\nof Representatives, and, in the hands of Judge Douglas, failed of passing\r\nonly for want of time. This bill contained no repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise. Indeed, when it was assailed because it did not contain such\r\nrepeal, Judge Douglas defended it in its existing form. On January 4,\r\n1854, Judge Douglas introduces a new bill to give Nebraska territorial\r\ngovernment. He accompanies this bill with a report, in which last he\r\nexpressly recommends that the Missouri Compromise shall neither be\r\naffirmed nor repealed. Before long the bill is so modified as to make two\r\nterritories instead of one, calling the southern one Kansas.\r\n\r\nAlso, about a month after the introduction of the bill, on the Judge's own\r\nmotion it is so amended as to declare the Missouri Compromise inoperative\r\nand void; and, substantially, that the people who go and settle there may\r\nestablish slavery, or exclude it, as they may see fit. In this shape the\r\nbill passed both branches of Congress and became a law.\r\n\r\nThis is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The foregoing history\r\nmay not be precisely accurate in every particular, but I am sure it is\r\nsufficiently so for all the use I shall attempt to make of it, and in\r\nit we have before us the chief material enabling us to judge correctly\r\nwhether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong. I think,\r\nand shall try to show, that it is wrong--wrong in its direct effect,\r\nletting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska, and wrong in its prospective\r\nprinciple, allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world\r\nwhere men can be found inclined to take it.\r\n\r\nThis declared indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal,\r\nfor the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the\r\nmonstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our\r\nrepublican example of its just influence in the world; enables the enemies\r\nof free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites; causes\r\nthe real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity; and especially because\r\nit forces so many good men among ourselves into an open war with the very\r\nfundamental principles of civil liberty, criticizing the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but\r\nself-interest.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding let me say that I think I have no prejudice against the\r\nSouthern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If\r\nslavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it\r\ndid now exist among us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe\r\nof the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals on both\r\nsides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances, and others who\r\nwould gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence. We know\r\nthat some Southern men do free their slaves, go North and become tip-top\r\nabolitionists, while some Northern ones go South and become most cruel\r\nslave masters.\r\n\r\nWhen Southern people tell us that they are no more responsible for the\r\norigin of slavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said\r\nthat the institution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of\r\nit in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I\r\nsurely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do\r\nmyself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do\r\nas to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all the\r\nslaves, and send them to Liberia, to their own native land. But a moment's\r\nreflection would convince me that whatever of high hope (as I think\r\nthere is) there may be in this in the long run, its sudden execution is\r\nimpossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they would all perish\r\nin the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money\r\nenough to carry them there in many times ten days. What then? Free them\r\nall, and keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this\r\nbetters their condition? I think I would not hold one in slavery at any\r\nrate, yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon.\r\nWhat next? Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals?\r\nMy own feelings will not admit of this, and if mine would, we well know\r\nthat those of the great mass of whites will not. Whether this feeling\r\naccords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question, if\r\nindeed it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill\r\nfounded, cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot then make them equals. It\r\ndoes seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted, but\r\nfor their tardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our brethren of\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nWhen they remind us of their constitutional rights, I acknowledge\r\nthem--not grudgingly, but fully and fairly; and I would give them any\r\nlegislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives which should not in\r\nits stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than our\r\nordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one.\r\n\r\nBut all this, to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse for permitting\r\nslavery to go into our own free territory than it would for reviving the\r\nAfrican slave trade by law. The law which forbids the bringing of slaves\r\nfrom Africa, and that which has so long forbidden the taking of them\r\ninto Nebraska, can hardy be distinguished on any moral principle, and the\r\nrepeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe arguments by which the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is sought to\r\nbe justified are these:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the Nebraska country needed a territorial government.\r\n\r\nSecond. That in various ways the public had repudiated that compromise and\r\ndemanded the repeal, and therefore should not now complain of it.\r\n\r\n And, lastly, That the repeal establishes a principle which is\r\nintrinsically right.\r\n\r\nI will attempt an answer to each of them in its turn.\r\n\r\nFirst, then: If that country was in need of a territorial organization,\r\ncould it not have had it as well without as with a repeal? Iowa and\r\nMinnesota, to both of which the Missouri restriction applied, had, without\r\nits repeal, each in succession, territorial organizations. And even the\r\nyear before, a bill for Nebraska itself was within an ace of passing\r\nwithout the repealing clause, and this in the hands of the same men who\r\nare now the champions of repeal. Why no necessity then for repeal? But\r\nstill later, when this very bill was first brought in, it contained\r\nno repeal. But, say they, because the people had demanded, or rather\r\ncommanded, the repeal, the repeal was to accompany the organization\r\nwhenever that should occur.\r\n\r\nNow, I deny that the public ever demanded any such thing--ever repudiated\r\nthe Missouri Compromise, ever commanded its repeal. I deny it, and call\r\nfor the proof. It is not contended, I believe, that any such command has\r\never been given in express terms. It is only said that it was done in\r\nprinciple. The support of the Wilmot Proviso is the first fact mentioned\r\nto prove that the Missouri restriction was repudiated in principle, and\r\nthe second is the refusal to extend the Missouri line over the country\r\nacquired from Mexico. These are near enough alike to be treated together.\r\nThe one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the whole new\r\nacquisition by the lump, and the other was to reject a division of it, by\r\nwhich one half was to be given up to those chances. Now, whether this was\r\na repudiation of the Missouri line in principle depends upon whether the\r\nMissouri law contained any principle requiring the line to be extended\r\nover the country acquired from Mexico. I contend it did not. I insist\r\nthat it contained no general principle, but that it was, in every sense,\r\nspecific. That its terms limit it to the country purchased from France is\r\nundenied and undeniable. It could have no principle beyond the intention\r\nof those who made it. They did not intend to extend the line to country\r\nwhich they did not own. If they intended to extend it in the event of\r\nacquiring additional territory, why did they not say so? It was just as\r\neasy to say that \"in all the country west of the Mississippi which we now\r\nown, or may hereafter acquire, there shall never be slavery,\" as to say\r\nwhat they did say; and they would have said it if they had meant it. An\r\nintention to extend the law is not only not mentioned in the law, but is\r\nnot mentioned in any contemporaneous history. Both the law itself, and the\r\nhistory of the times, are a blank as to any principle of extension; and\r\nby neither the known rules of construing statutes and contracts, nor by\r\ncommon sense, can any such principle be inferred.\r\n\r\nAnother fact showing the specific character of the Missouri law--showing\r\nthat it intended no more than it expressed, showing that the line was not\r\nintended as a universal dividing line between Free and Slave territory,\r\npresent and prospective, north of which slavery could never go--is the\r\nfact that by that very law Missouri came in as a slave State, north of the\r\nline. If that law contained any prospective principle, the whole law must\r\nbe looked to in order to ascertain what the principle was. And by this\r\nrule the South could fairly contend that, inasmuch as they got one slave\r\nState north of the line at the inception of the law, they have the right\r\nto have another given them north of it occasionally, now and then, in the\r\nindefinite westward extension of the line. This demonstrates the absurdity\r\nof attempting to deduce a prospective principle from the Missouri\r\nCompromise line.\r\n\r\nWhen we voted for the Wilmot Proviso we were voting to keep slavery out\r\nof the whole Mexican acquisition, and little did we think we were thereby\r\nvoting to let it into Nebraska lying several hundred miles distant. When\r\nwe voted against extending the Missouri line, little did we think we were\r\nvoting to destroy the old line, then of near thirty years' standing.\r\n\r\nTo argue that we thus repudiated the Missouri Compromise is no less absurd\r\nthan it would be to argue that because we have so far forborne to acquire\r\nCuba, we have thereby, in principle, repudiated our former acquisitions\r\nand determined to throw them out of the Union. No less absurd than it\r\nwould be to say that because I may have refused to build an addition to\r\nmy house, I thereby have decided to destroy the existing house! And if\r\nI catch you setting fire to my house, you will turn upon me and say I\r\ninstructed you to do it!\r\n\r\nThe most conclusive argument, however, that while for the Wilmot Proviso,\r\nand while voting against the extension of the Missouri line, we never\r\nthought of disturbing the original Missouri Compromise, is found in the\r\nfact that there was then, and still is, an unorganized tract of fine\r\ncountry, nearly as large as the State of Missouri, lying immediately west\r\nof Arkansas and south of the Missouri Compromise line, and that we never\r\nattempted to prohibit slavery as to it. I wish particular attention to\r\nthis. It adjoins the original Missouri Compromise line by its northern\r\nboundary, and consequently is part of the country into which by\r\nimplication slavery was permitted to go by that compromise. There it has\r\nlain open ever s, and there it still lies, and yet no effort has been made\r\nat any time to wrest it from the South. In all our struggles to prohibit\r\nslavery within our Mexican acquisitions, we never so much as lifted a\r\nfinger to prohibit it as to this tract. Is not this entirely conclusive\r\nthat at all times we have held the Missouri Compromise as a sacred thing,\r\neven when against ourselves as well as when for us?\r\n\r\nSenator Douglas sometimes says the Missouri line itself was in principle\r\nonly an extension of the line of the Ordinance of '87--that is to say, an\r\nextension of the Ohio River. I think this is weak enough on its face. I\r\nwill remark, however, that, as a glance at the map will show, the Missouri\r\nline is a long way farther south than the Ohio, and that if our Senator in\r\nproposing his extension had stuck to the principle of jogging southward,\r\nperhaps it might not have been voted down so readily.\r\n\r\nBut next it is said that the compromises of '50, and the ratification of\r\nthem by both political parties in '52, established a new principle which\r\nrequired the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. This again I deny. I deny\r\nit, and demand the proof. I have already stated fully what the compromises\r\nof '50 are. That particular part of those measures from which the virtual\r\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise is sought to be inferred (for it is\r\nadmitted they contain nothing about it in express terms) is the provision\r\nin the Utah and New Mexico laws which permits them when they seek\r\nadmission into the Union as States to come in with or without slavery, as\r\nthey shall then see fit. Now I insist this provision was made for Utah\r\nand New Mexico, and for no other place whatever. It had no more direct\r\nreference to Nebraska than it had to the territories of the moon. But,\r\nsay they, it had reference to Nebraska in principle. Let us see. The\r\nNorth consented to this provision, not because they considered it right in\r\nitself, but because they were compensated--paid for it.\r\n\r\nThey at the same time got California into the Union as a free State. This\r\nwas far the best part of all they had struggled for by the Wilmot Proviso.\r\nThey also got the area of slavery somewhat narrowed in the settlement\r\nof the boundary of Texas. Also they got the slave trade abolished in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\nFor all these desirable objects the North could afford to yield something;\r\nand they did yield to the South the Utah and New Mexico provision. I do\r\nnot mean that the whole North, or even a majority, yielded, when the law\r\npassed; but enough yielded--when added to the vote of the South, to\r\ncarry the measure. Nor can it be pretended that the principle of this\r\narrangement requires us to permit the same provision to be applied to\r\nNebraska, without any equivalent at all. Give us another free State; press\r\nthe boundary of Texas still farther back; give us another step toward the\r\ndestruction of slavery in the District, and you present us a similar case.\r\nBut ask us not to repeat, for nothing, what you paid for in the first\r\ninstance. If you wish the thing again, pay again. That is the principle of\r\nthe compromises of '50, if, indeed, they had any principles beyond their\r\nspecific terms--it was the system of equivalents.\r\n\r\nAgain, if Congress, at that time, intended that all future Territories\r\nshould, when admitted as States, come in with or without slavery at their\r\nown option, why did it not say so? With such a universal provision, all\r\nknow the bills could not have passed. Did they, then--could they-establish\r\na principle contrary to their own intention? Still further, if they\r\nintended to establish the principle that, whenever Congress had control,\r\nit should be left to the people to do as they thought fit with slavery,\r\nwhy did they not authorize the people of the District of Columbia, at\r\ntheir option, to abolish slavery within their limits?\r\n\r\nI personally know that this has not been left undone because it was\r\nunthought of. It was frequently spoken of by members of Congress, and by\r\ncitizens of Washington, six years ago; and I heard no one express a doubt\r\nthat a system of gradual emancipation, with compensation to owners,\r\nwould meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the\r\nDistrict. But without the action of Congress they could say nothing; and\r\nCongress said \"No.\" In the measures of 1850, Congress had the subject of\r\nslavery in the District expressly on hand. If they were then establishing\r\nthe principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slavery,\r\nwhy did they not apply the principle to that people?\r\n\r\nAgain it is claimed that by the resolutions of the Illinois Legislature,\r\npassed in 1851, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was demanded. This\r\nI deny also. Whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language of\r\nthose resolutions, the people have never understood them as being any\r\nmore than an indorsement of the compromises of 1850, and a release of our\r\nsenators from voting for the Wilmot Proviso. The whole people are living\r\nwitnesses that this only was their view. Finally, it is asked, \"If we\r\ndid not mean to apply the Utah and New Mexico provision to all future\r\nterritories, what did we mean when we, in 1852, indorsed the compromises\r\nof 1850?\"\r\n\r\nFor myself I can answer this question most easily. I meant not to ask a\r\nrepeal or modification of the Fugitive Slave law. I meant not to ask\r\nfor the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. I meant not to\r\nresist the admission of Utah and New Mexico, even should they ask to come\r\nin as slave States. I meant nothing about additional Territories, because,\r\nas I understood, we then had no Territory whose character as to slavery\r\nwas not already settled. As to Nebraska, I regarded its character as being\r\nfixed by the Missouri Compromise for thirty years--as unalterably fixed\r\nas that of my own home in Illinois. As to new acquisitions, I said,\r\n\"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\" When we make new\r\nacquisitions, we will, as heretofore, try to manage them somehow. That is\r\nmy answer; that is what I meant and said; and I appeal to the people to\r\nsay each for himself whether that is not also the universal meaning of the\r\nfree States.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in turn, let me ask a few questions. If, by any or all these\r\nmatters, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was commanded, why was not\r\nthe command sooner obeyed? Why was the repeal omitted in the Nebraska\r\nBill of 1853? Why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854? Why in the\r\naccompanying report was such a repeal characterized as a departure from\r\nthe course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended?\r\n\r\nI am aware Judge Douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal is\r\nno substantial alteration of the bill. This argument seems wonderful to\r\nme. It is as if one should argue that white and black are not different.\r\nHe admits, however, that there is a literal change in the bill, and that\r\nhe made the change in deference to other senators who would not support\r\nthe bill without. This proves that those other senators thought the\r\nchange a substantial one, and that the Judge thought their opinions worth\r\ndeferring to. His own opinions, therefore, seem not to rest on a very firm\r\nbasis, even in his own mind; and I suppose the world believes, and will\r\ncontinue to believe, that precisely on the substance of that change this\r\nwhole agitation has arisen.\r\n\r\nI conclude, then, that the public never demanded the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise.\r\n\r\nI now come to consider whether the appeal with its avowed principles, is\r\nintrinsically right. I insist that it is not. Take the particular case. A\r\ncontroversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slavery,\r\nin relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased of\r\nFrance. The southern, and then best, part of the purchase was already in\r\nas a slave State. The controversy was settled by also letting Missouri\r\nin as a slave State; but with the agreement that within all the remaining\r\npart of the purchase, north of a certain line, there should never be\r\nslavery. As to what was to be done with the remaining part, south of the\r\nline, nothing was said; but perhaps the fair implication was, it should\r\ncome in with slavery if it should so choose. The southern part, except a\r\nportion heretofore mentioned, afterward did come in with slavery, as the\r\nState of Arkansas. All these many years, since 1820, the northern part\r\nhad remained a wilderness. At length settlements began in it also. In due\r\ncourse Iowa came in as a free State, and Minnesota was given a territorial\r\ngovernment, without removing the slavery restriction. Finally, the\r\nsole remaining part north of the line--Kansas and Nebraska--was to be\r\norganized; and it is proposed, and carried, to blot out the old dividing\r\nline of thirty-four years' standing, and to open the whole of that country\r\nto the introduction of slavery. Now this, to my mind, is manifestly\r\nunjust. After an angry and dangerous controversy, the parties made friends\r\nby dividing the bone of contention. The one party first appropriates her\r\nown share, beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it, and\r\nthen seizes the share of the other party. It is as if two starving men had\r\ndivided their only loaf, the one had hastily swallowed his half, and then\r\ngrabbed the other's half just as he was putting it to his mouth.\r\n\r\nLet me here drop the main argument, to notice what I consider rather\r\nan inferior matter. It is argued that slavery will not go to Kansas and\r\nNebraska, in any event. This is a palliation, a lullaby. I have some hope\r\nthat it will not; but let us not be too confident. As to climate, a glance\r\nat the map shows that there are five slave States--Delaware, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, Kentucky, and Missouri, and also the District of Columbia, all\r\nnorth of the Missouri Compromise line. The census returns of 1850 show\r\nthat within these there are eight hundred and sixty-seven thousand two\r\nhundred and seventy-six slaves, being more than one fourth of all the\r\nslaves in the nation.\r\n\r\nIt is not climate, then, that will keep slavery out of these Territories.\r\nIs there anything in the peculiar nature of the country? Missouri adjoins\r\nthese Territories by her entire western boundary, and slavery is already\r\nwithin every one of her western counties. I have even heard it said that\r\nthere are more slaves in proportion to whites in the northwestern county\r\nof Missouri than within any other county in the State. Slavery pressed\r\nentirely up to the old western boundary of the State, and when rather\r\nrecently a part of that boundary at the northwest was moved out a little\r\nfarther west, slavery followed on quite up to the new line. Now, when the\r\nrestriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?\r\nClimate will not, no peculiarity of the country will, nothing in nature\r\nwill. Will the disposition of the people prevent it? Those nearest the\r\nscene are all in favor of the extension. The Yankees who are opposed to it\r\nmay be most flumerous; but, in military phrase, the battlefield is too far\r\nfrom their base of operations.\r\n\r\nBut it is said there now is no law in Nebraska on the subject of slavery,\r\nand that, in such case, taking a slave there operates his freedom. That is\r\ngood book-law, but it is not the rule of actual practice. Wherever slavery\r\nis it has been first introduced without law. The oldest laws we find\r\nconcerning it are not laws introducing it, but regulating it as an already\r\nexisting thing. A white man takes his slave to Nebraska now. Who will\r\ninform the negro that he is free? Who will take him before court to test\r\nthe question of his freedom? In ignorance of his legal emancipation he is\r\nkept chopping, splitting, and plowing. Others are brought, and move on in\r\nthe same track. At last, if ever the time for voting comes on the question\r\nof slavery the institution already, in fact, exists in the country, and\r\ncannot well be removed. The fact of its presence, and the difficulty of\r\nits removal, will carry the vote in its favor. Keep it out until a vote is\r\ntaken, and a vote in favor of it cannot be got in any population of forty\r\nthousand on earth, who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives of\r\nemigration and settlement. To get slaves into the Territory simultaneously\r\nwith the whites in the incipient stages of settlement is the precise stake\r\nplayed for and won in this Nebraska measure.\r\n\r\nThe question is asked us: \"If slaves will go in notwithstanding the\r\ngeneral principle of law liberates them, why would they not equally go in\r\nagainst positive statute law--go in, even if the Missouri restriction were\r\nmaintained!\" I answer, because it takes a much bolder man to venture\r\nin with his property in the latter case than in the former; because the\r\npositive Congressional enactment is known to and respected by all, or\r\nnearly all, whereas the negative principle that no law is free law is not\r\nmuch known except among lawyers. We have some experience of this practical\r\ndifference. In spite of the Ordinance of '87, a few negroes were brought\r\ninto Illinois, and held in a state of quasi-slavery, not enough, however,\r\nto carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came\r\nto form a constitution. But into the adjoining Missouri country, where\r\nthere was no Ordinance of '87,--was no restriction,--they were carried\r\nten times, nay, a hundred times, as fast, and actually made a slave State.\r\nThis is fact-naked fact.\r\n\r\nAnother lullaby argument is that taking slaves to new countries does not\r\nincrease their number, does not make any one slave who would otherwise\r\nbe free. There is some truth in this, and I am glad of it; but it is not\r\nwholly true. The African slave trade is not yet effectually suppressed;\r\nand, if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people among us who\r\nare foreigners and the descendants of foreigners arriving here since 1808,\r\nwe shall find the increase of the black population outrunning that of the\r\nwhite to an extent unaccountable, except by supposing that some of them,\r\ntoo, have been coming from Africa. If this be so, the opening of new\r\ncountries to the institution increases the demand for and augments the\r\nprice of slaves, and so does, in fact, make slaves of freemen, by causing\r\nthem to be brought from Africa and sold into bondage.\r\n\r\nBut however this may be, we know the opening of new countries to slavery\r\ntends to the perpetuation of the institution, and so does keep men in\r\nslavery who would otherwise be free. This result we do not feel like\r\nfavoring, and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\nEqual justice to the South, it is said, requires us to consent to the\r\nextension of slavery to new countries. That is to say, inasmuch as you do\r\nnot object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must not object\r\nto your taking your slave. Now, I admit that this is perfectly logical\r\nif there is no difference between hogs and negroes. But while you thus\r\nrequire me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish to ask whether you of\r\nthe South, yourselves, have ever been willing to do as much? It is kindly\r\nprovided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage\r\nare natural tyrants. That percentage is no larger in the slave States\r\nthan in the free. The great majority South, as well as North, have human\r\nsympathies, of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of\r\ntheir sensibility to physical pain. These sympathies in the bosoms of\r\nthe Southern people manifest, in many ways, their sense of the wrong of\r\nslavery, and their consciousness that, after all, there is humanity in the\r\nnegro. If they deny this, let me address them a few plain questions. In\r\n1820 you (the South) joined the North, almost unanimously, in declaring\r\nthe African slave trade piracy, and in annexing to it the punishment of\r\ndeath. Why did you do this? If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did\r\nyou join in providing that men should be hung for it? The practice was no\r\nmore than bringing wild negroes from Africa to such as would buy them.\r\nBut you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses,\r\nwild buffaloes, or wild bears.\r\n\r\nAgain, you have among you a sneaking individual of the class of native\r\ntyrants known as the \"slavedealer.\" He watches your necessities, and\r\ncrawls up to buy your slave, at a speculating price. If you cannot help\r\nit, you sell to him; but if you can help it, you drive him from your door.\r\nYou despise him utterly. You do not recognize him as a friend, or even\r\nas an honest man. Your children must not play with his; they may rollick\r\nfreely with the little negroes, but not with the slave-dealer's children.\r\nIf you are obliged to deal with him, you try to get through the job\r\nwithout so much as touching him. It is common with you to join hands\r\nwith the men you meet, but with the slave-dealer you avoid the\r\nceremony--instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact. If he grows rich\r\nand retires from business, you still remember him, and still keep up the\r\nban of non-intercourse upon him and his family. Now, why is this? You do\r\nnot so treat the man who deals in corn, cotton, or tobacco.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again: There are in the United States and Territories, including\r\nthe District of Columbia, 433,643 free blacks. At five hundred dollars per\r\nhead they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars. How comes this\r\nvast amount of property to be running about without owners? We do not see\r\nfree horses or free cattle running at large. How is this? All these free\r\nblacks are the descendants of slaves, or have been slaves themselves; and\r\nthey would be slaves now but for something which has operated on their\r\nwhite owners, inducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate them.\r\nWhat is that something? Is there any mistaking it? In all these cases it\r\nis your sense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you that\r\nthe poor negro has some natural right to himself--that those who deny it\r\nand make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings, contempt, and death.\r\n\r\nAnd now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave, and\r\nestimate him as only the equal of the hog? Why ask us to do what you will\r\nnot do yourselves? Why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred millions\r\nof dollars could not induce you to do?\r\n\r\nBut one great argument in support of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise\r\nis still to come. That argument is \"the sacred right of self-government.\"\r\nIt seems our distinguished Senator has found great difficulty in getting\r\nhis antagonists, even in the Senate, to meet him fairly on this argument.\r\nSome poet has said:\r\n\r\n\"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\"\r\n\r\nAt the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation, I\r\nmeet that argument--I rush in--I take that bull by the horns. I trust I\r\nunderstand and truly estimate the right of self-government. My faith in\r\nthe proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with\r\nall which is exclusively his own lies at the foundation of the sense of\r\njustice there is in me. I extend the principle to communities of men as\r\nwell as to individuals. I so extend it because it is politically wise, as\r\nwell as naturally just; politically wise in saving us from broils about\r\nmatters which do not concern us. Here, or at Washington, I would not\r\ntrouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia, or the cranberry laws\r\nof Indiana. The doctrine of self-government is right,--absolutely and\r\neternally right,--but it has no just application as here attempted. Or\r\nperhaps I should rather say that whether it has such application depends\r\nupon whether a negro is or is not a man. If he is not a man, in that case\r\nhe who is a man may as a matter of self-government do just what he pleases\r\nwith him. But if the negro is a man, is it not to that extent a total\r\ndestruction of self-government to say that he too shall not govern\r\nhimself? When the white man governs himself, that is self-government; but\r\nwhen he governs himself and also governs another man, that is more than\r\nself-government--that is despotism. If the negro is a man, why, then, my\r\nancient faith teaches me that \"all men are created equal,\" and that there\r\ncan be no moral right in connection with one man's making a slave of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm, paraphrases\r\nour argument by saying: \"The white people of Nebraska are good enough to\r\ngovern themselves, but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable\r\nnegroes!\"\r\n\r\nWell, I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are and will continue to\r\nbe as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the contrary.\r\nWhat I do say is that no man is good enough to govern another man\r\nwithout that other's consent. I say this is the leading principle, the\r\nsheet-anchor of American republicanism. Our Declaration of Independence\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal;\r\nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights;\r\nthat among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to\r\nsecure these rights, governments are instituted among men, DERIVING THEIR\r\nJUST POWERS PROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.\"\r\n\r\nI have quoted so much at this time merely to show that, according to our\r\nancient faith, the just powers of government are derived from the consent\r\nof the governed. Now the relation of master and slave is pro tanto a total\r\nviolation of this principle. The master not only governs the slave without\r\nhis consent, but he governs him by a set of rules altogether different\r\nfrom those which he prescribes for himself. Allow all the governed\r\nan equal voice in the government, and that, and that only, is\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nLet it not be said that I am contending for the establishment of political\r\nand social equality between the whites and blacks. I have already said the\r\ncontrary. I am not combating the argument of necessity, arising from the\r\nfact that the blacks are already among us; but I am combating what is set\r\nup as moral argument for allowing them to be taken where they have never\r\nyet been--arguing against the extension of a bad thing, which, where it\r\nalready exists, we must of necessity manage as we best can.\r\n\r\nIn support of his application of the doctrine of self-government, Senator\r\nDouglas has sought to bring to his aid the opinions and examples of our\r\nRevolutionary fathers. I am glad he has done this. I love the sentiments\r\nof those old-time men, and shall be most happy to abide by their opinions.\r\nHe shows us that when it was in contemplation for the colonies to break\r\noff from Great Britain, and set up a new government for themselves,\r\nseveral of the States instructed their delegates to go for the measure,\r\nprovided each State should be allowed to regulate its domestic concerns in\r\nits own way. I do not quote; but this in substance. This was right; I see\r\nnothing objectionable in it. I also think it probable that it had some\r\nreference to the existence of slavery among them. I will not deny that\r\nit had. But had it any reference to the carrying of slavery into new\r\ncountries? That is the question, and we will let the fathers themselves\r\nanswer it.\r\n\r\nThis same generation of men, and mostly the same individuals of the\r\ngeneration who declared this principle, who declared independence,\r\nwho fought the war of the Revolution through, who afterward made the\r\nConstitution under which we still live--these same men passed the\r\nOrdinance of '87, declaring that slavery should never go to the Northwest\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt Judge Douglas thinks they were very inconsistent in this.\r\nIt is a question of discrimination between them and him. But there is\r\nnot an inch of ground left for his claiming that their opinions, their\r\nexample, their authority, are on his side in the controversy.\r\n\r\nAgain, is not Nebraska, while a Territory, a part of us? Do we not own the\r\ncountry? And if we surrender the control of it, do we not surrender the\r\nright of self-government? It is part of ourselves. If you say we shall not\r\ncontrol it, because it is only part, the same is true of every other part;\r\nand when all the parts are gone, what has become of the whole? What\r\nis then left of us? What use for the General Government, when there is\r\nnothing left for it to govern?\r\n\r\nBut you say this question should be left to the people of Nebraska,\r\nbecause they are more particularly interested. If this be the rule, you\r\nmust leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have\r\nslaves. What better moral right have thirty-one citizens of Nebraska to\r\nsay that the thirty-second shall not hold slaves than the people of\r\nthe thirty-one States have to say that slavery shall not go into the\r\nthirty-second State at all?\r\n\r\nBut if it is a sacred right for the people of Nebraska to take and hold\r\nslaves there, it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they can\r\nbuy them cheapest; and that, undoubtedly, will be on the coast of Africa,\r\nprovided you will consent not to hang them for going there to buy\r\nthem. You must remove this restriction, too, from the sacred right of\r\nself-government. I am aware you say that taking slaves from the States to\r\nNebraska does not make slaves of freemen; but the African slave-trader can\r\nsay just as much. He does not catch free negroes and bring them here.\r\nHe finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors, and he\r\nhonestly buys them at the rate of a red cotton handkerchief a head.\r\nThis is very cheap, and it is a great abridgment of the sacred right of\r\nself-government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade.\r\n\r\nAnother important objection to this application of the right of\r\nself-government is that it enables the first few to deprive the succeeding\r\nmany of a free exercise of the right of self-government. The first few\r\nmay get slavery in, and the subsequent many cannot easily get it out. How\r\ncommon is the remark now in the slave States, \"If we were only clear\r\nof our slaves, how much better it would be for us.\" They are actually\r\ndeprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would, by the\r\naction of a very few in the beginning. The same thing was true of the\r\nwhole nation at the time our Constitution was formed.\r\n\r\nWhether slavery shall go into Nebraska, or other new Territories, is not\r\na matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there. The whole\r\nnation is interested that the best use shall be made of these Territories.\r\nWe want them for homes of free white people. This they cannot be, to any\r\nconsiderable extent, if slavery shall be planted within them. Slave States\r\nare places for poor white people to remove from, not to remove to. New\r\nfree States are the places for poor people to go to, and better their\r\ncondition. For this use the nation needs these Territories.\r\n\r\nStill further: there are constitutional relations between the slave\r\nand free States which are degrading to the latter. We are under legal\r\nobligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them: a sort\r\nof dirty, disagreeable job, which, I believe, as a general rule, the\r\nslaveholders will not perform for one another. Then again, in the control\r\nof the government--the management of the partnership affairs--they have\r\ngreatly the advantage of us. By the Constitution each State has two\r\nsenators, each has a number of representatives in proportion to the number\r\nof its people, and each has a number of Presidential electors equal to\r\nthe whole number of its senators and representatives together. But in\r\nascertaining the number of the people for this purpose, five slaves are\r\ncounted as being equal to three whites. The slaves do not vote; they are\r\nonly counted and so used as to swell the influence of the white people's\r\nvotes. The practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparison\r\nof the States of South Carolina and Maine. South Carolina has six\r\nrepresentatives, and so has Maine; South Carolina has eight Presidential\r\nelectors, and so has Maine. This is precise equality so far; and of course\r\nthey are equal in senators, each having two. Thus in the control of the\r\ngovernment the two States are equals precisely. But how are they in the\r\nnumber of their white people? Maine has 581,813, while South Carolina has\r\n274,567; Maine has twice as many as South Carolina, and 32,679 over. Thus,\r\neach white man in South Carolina is more than the double of any man in\r\nMaine. This is all because South Carolina, besides her free people, has\r\n384,984 slaves. The South Carolinian has precisely the same advantage over\r\nthe white man in every other free State as well as in Maine. He is more\r\nthan the double of any one of us in this crowd. The same advantage, but\r\nnot to the same extent, is held by all the citizens of the slave States\r\nover those of the free; and it is an absolute truth, without an exception,\r\nthat there is no voter in any slave State but who has more legal power in\r\nthe government than any voter in any free State. There is no instance\r\nof exact equality; and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapter\r\nthrough. This principle, in the aggregate, gives the slave States in the\r\npresent Congress twenty additional representatives, being seven more than\r\nthe whole majority by which they passed the Nebraska Bill.\r\n\r\nNow all this is manifestly unfair; yet I do not mention it to complain of\r\nit, in so far as it is already settled. It is in the Constitution, and I\r\ndo not for that cause, or any other cause, propose to destroy, or alter,\r\nor disregard the Constitution. I stand to it, fairly, fully, and firmly.\r\n\r\nBut when I am told I must leave it altogether to other people to say\r\nwhether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm, on\r\nthe same degrading terms against me, I respectfully demur. I insist that\r\nwhether I shall be a whole man or only the half of one, in comparison with\r\nothers is a question in which I am somewhat concerned, and one which no\r\nother man can have a sacred right of deciding for me. If I am wrong in\r\nthis, if it really be a sacred right of self-government in the man who\r\nshall go to Nebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of me or the\r\ndouble of me, then, after he shall have exercised that right, and thereby\r\nshall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than I already\r\nam, I should like for some gentleman, deeply skilled in the mysteries of\r\nsacred rights, to provide himself with a microscope, and peep about, and\r\nfind out, if he can, what has become of my sacred rights. They will surely\r\nbe too small for detection with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nFinally, I insist that if there is anything which it is the duty of the\r\nwhole people to never intrust to any hands but their own, that thing is\r\nthe preservation and perpetuity of their own liberties and institutions.\r\nAnd if they shall think as I do, that the extension of slavery endangers\r\nthem more than any or all other causes, how recreant to themselves if\r\nthey submit The question, and with it the fate of their country, to a mere\r\nhandful of men bent only on seif-interest. If this question of slavery\r\nextension were an insignificant one, one having no power to do harm--it\r\nmight be shuffled aside in this way; and being, as it is, the great\r\nBehemoth of danger, shall the strong grip of the nation be loosened upon\r\nhim, to intrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers?\r\n\r\nI have done with this mighty argument of self-government. Go, sacred\r\nthing! Go in peace.\r\n\r\nBut Nebraska is urged as a great Union-saving measure. Well, I too go for\r\nsaving the Union. Much as I hate slavery, I would consent to the extension\r\nof it rather than see the Union dissolved, just as I would consent to any\r\ngreat evil to avoid a greater one. But when I go to Union-saving, I must\r\nbelieve, at least, that the means I employ have some adaptation to the\r\nend. To my mind, Nebraska has no such adaptation.\r\n\r\n\"It hath no relish of salvation in it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an aggravation, rather, of the only one thing which ever endangers\r\nthe Union. When it came upon us, all was peace and quiet. The nation was\r\nlooking to the forming of new bends of union, and a long course of peace\r\nand prosperity seemed to lie before us. In the whole range of possibility,\r\nthere scarcely appears to me to have been anything out of which the\r\nslavery agitation could have been revived, except the very project of\r\nrepealing the Missouri Compromise. Every inch of territory we owned\r\nalready had a definite settlement of the slavery question, by which all\r\nparties were pledged to abide. Indeed, there was no uninhabited country on\r\nthe continent which we could acquire, if we except some extreme northern\r\nregions which are wholly out of the question.\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs the Genius of Discord himself could scarcely have\r\ninvented a way of again setting us by the ears but by turning back and\r\ndestroying the peace measures of the past. The counsels of that Genius\r\nseem to have prevailed. The Missouri Compromise was repealed; and here\r\nwe are in the midst of a new slavery agitation, such, I think, as we have\r\nnever seen before. Who is responsible for this? Is it those who resist\r\nthe measure, or those who causelessly brought it forward, and pressed it\r\nthrough, having reason to know, and in fact knowing, it must and would be\r\nso resisted? It could not but be expected by its author that it would be\r\nlooked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery, aggravated by a\r\ngross breach of faith.\r\n\r\nArgue as you will and long as you will, this is the naked front and aspect\r\nof the measure. And in this aspect it could not but produce agitation.\r\nSlavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature--opposition to it in\r\nhis love of justice. These principles are at eternal antagonism, and\r\nwhen brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings them,\r\nshocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow. Repeal the\r\nMissouri Compromise, repeal all compromises, repeal the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, repeal all past history, you still cannot repeal human\r\nnature. It still will be the abundance of man's heart that slavery\r\nextension is wrong, and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will\r\ncontinue to speak.\r\n\r\nThe structure, too, of the Nebraska Bill is very peculiar. The people are\r\nto decide the question of slavery for themselves; but when they are to\r\ndecide, or how they are to decide, or whether, when the question is\r\nonce decided, it is to remain so or is to be subject to an indefinite\r\nsuccession of new trials, the law does not say. Is it to be decided by the\r\nfirst dozen settlers who arrive there, or is it to await the arrival of\r\na hundred? Is it to be decided by a vote of the people or a vote of the\r\nLegislature, or, indeed, by a vote of any sort? To these questions the law\r\ngives no answer. There is a mystery about this; for when a member proposed\r\nto give the Legislature express authority to exclude slavery, it was\r\nhooted down by the friends of the bill. This fact is worth remembering.\r\nSome Yankees in the East are sending emigrants to Nebraska to exclude\r\nslavery from it; and, so far as I can judge, they expect the question to\r\nbe decided by voting in some way or other. But the Missourians are awake,\r\ntoo. They are within a stone's-throw of the contested ground. They hold\r\nmeetings and pass resolutions, in which not the slightest allusion to\r\nvoting is made. They resolve that slavery already exists in the Territory;\r\nthat more shall go there; that they, remaining in Missouri, will protect\r\nit, and that abolitionists shall be hung or driven away. Through all this\r\nbowie knives and six-shooters are seen plainly enough, but never a glimpse\r\nof the ballot-box.\r\n\r\nAnd, really, what is the result of all this? Each party within having\r\nnumerous and determined backers without, is it not probable that the\r\ncontest will come to blows and bloodshed? Could there be a more apt\r\ninvention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question\r\nthan this Nebraska project is? I do not charge or believe that such was\r\nintended by Congress; but if they had literally formed a ring and placed\r\nchampions within it to fight out the controversy, the fight could be no\r\nmore likely to come off than it is. And if this fight should begin, is it\r\nlikely to take a very peaceful, Union-saving turn? Will not the first drop\r\nof blood so shed be the real knell of the Union?\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Compromise ought to be restored. For the sake of the Union,\r\nit ought to be restored. We ought to elect a House of Representatives\r\nwhich will vote its restoration. If by any means we omit to do this, what\r\nfollows? Slavery may or may not be established in Nebraska. But whether\r\nit be or not, we shall have repudiated--discarded from the councils of the\r\nnation--the spirit of compromise; for who, after this, will ever trust in\r\na national compromise? The spirit of mutual concession--that spirit which\r\nfirst gave us the Constitution, and which has thrice saved the Union--we\r\nshall have strangled and cast from us forever. And what shall we have\r\nin lieu of it? The South flushed with triumph and tempted to excess;\r\nthe North, betrayed as they believe, brooding on wrong and burning for\r\nrevenge. One side will provoke, the other resent. The one will taunt,\r\nthe other defy; one aggresses, the other retaliates. Already a few in\r\nthe North defy all constitutional restraints, resist the execution of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave law, and even menace the institution of slavery in\r\nthe States where it exists. Already a few in the South claim the\r\nconstitutional right to take and to hold slaves in the free States, demand\r\nthe revival of the slave trade, and demand a treaty with Great Britain by\r\nwhich fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from Canada. As yet they are but\r\nfew on either side. It is a grave question for lovers of the union whether\r\nthe final destruction of the Missouri Compromise, and with it the spirit\r\nof all compromise, will or will not embolden and embitter each of these,\r\nand fatally increase the number of both.\r\n\r\nBut restore the compromise, and what then? We thereby restore the national\r\nfaith, the national confidence, the national feeling of brotherhood. We\r\nthereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise, that spirit\r\nwhich has never failed us in past perils, and which may be safely trusted\r\nfor all the future. The South ought to join in doing this. The peace of\r\nthe nation is as dear to them as to us. In memories of the past and hopes\r\nof the future, they share as largely as we. It would be on their part a\r\ngreat act--great in its spirit, and great in its effect. It would be worth\r\nto the nation a hundred years purchase of peace and prosperity. And what\r\nof sacrifice would they make? They only surrender to us what they gave\r\nus for a consideration long, long ago; what they have not now asked for,\r\nstruggled or cared for; what has been thrust upon them, not less to their\r\nastonishment than to ours.\r\n\r\nBut it is said we cannot restore it; that though we elect every member of\r\nthe lower House, the Senate is still against us. It is quite true that of\r\nthe senators who passed the Nebraska Bill a majority of the whole Senate\r\nwill retain their seats in spite of the elections of this and the next\r\nyear. But if at these elections their several constituencies shall clearly\r\nexpress their will against Nebraska, will these senators disregard their\r\nwill? Will they neither obey nor make room for those who will?\r\n\r\nBut even if we fail to technically restore the compromise, it is still a\r\ngreat point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration. The\r\nmoral weight of such a vote cannot be estimated too highly. The authors\r\nof Nebraska are not at all satisfied with the destruction of the\r\ncompromise--an indorsement of this principle they proclaim to be the\r\ngreat object. With them, Nebraska alone is a small matter--to establish a\r\nprinciple for future use is what they particularly desire.\r\n\r\nThe future use is to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world\r\nlocal and unorganized opposition cannot prevent it. Now, if you wish to\r\ngive them this indorsement, if you wish to establish this principle, do\r\nso. I shall regret it, but it is your right. On the contrary, if you are\r\nopposed to the principle,--intend to give it no such indorsement, let no\r\nwheedling, no sophistry, divert you from throwing a direct vote against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSome men, mostly Whigs, who condemn the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,\r\nnevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration, lest they be thrown in\r\ncompany with the abolitionists. Will they allow me, as an old Whig, to\r\ntell them, good-humoredly, that I think this is very silly? Stand with\r\nanybody that stands right. Stand with him while he is right, and part\r\nwith him when he goes wrong. Stand with the abolitionist in restoring the\r\nMissouri Compromise, and stand against him when he attempts to repeal\r\nthe Fugitive Slave law. In the latter case you stand with the Southern\r\ndisunionist. What of that? You are still right. In both cases you are\r\nright. In both cases you oppose the dangerous extremes. In both you stand\r\non middle ground, and hold the ship level and steady. In both you are\r\nnational, and nothing less than national. This is the good old Whig\r\nground. To desert such ground because of any company is to be less than a\r\nWhig--less than a man--less than an American.\r\n\r\nI particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of\r\nthis Nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic. I object to it\r\nbecause it assumes that there can be moral right in the enslaving of\r\none man by another. I object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a free\r\npeople--a sad evidence that, feeling prosperity, we forget right; that\r\nliberty, as a principle, we have ceased to revere. I object to it because\r\nthe fathers of the republic eschewed and rejected it. The argument of\r\n\"necessity\" was the only argument they ever admitted in favor of slavery;\r\nand so far, and so far only, as it carried them did they ever go. They\r\nfound the institution existing among us, which they could not help,\r\nand they cast blame upon the British king for having permitted its\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nThe royally appointed Governor of Georgia in the early 1700's was\r\nthreatened by the King with removal if he continued to oppose slavery in\r\nhis colony--at that time the King of England made a small profit on every\r\nslave imported to the colonies. The later British criticism of the United\r\nStates for not eradicating slavery in the early 1800's, combined with\r\ntheir tacit support of the 'Confederacy' during the Civil War is a prime\r\nexample of the irony and hypocrisy of politics: that self-interest will\r\never overpower right.\r\n\r\nBefore the Constitution they prohibited its introduction into the\r\nNorthwestern Territory, the only country we owned then free from it. At\r\nthe framing and adoption of the Constitution, they forbore to so much\r\nas mention the word \"slave\" or \"slavery\" in the whole instrument. In\r\nthe provision for the recovery of fugitives, the slave is spoken of as a\r\n\"person held to service or labor.\" In that prohibiting the abolition of\r\nthe African slave trade for twenty years, that trade is spoken of as \"the\r\nmigration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing\r\nshall think proper to admit,\" etc. These are the only provisions alluding\r\nto slavery. Thus the thing is hid away in the Constitution, just as an\r\nafflicted man hides away a wen or cancer which he dares not cut out at\r\nonce, lest he bleed to death,--with the promise, nevertheless, that the\r\ncutting may begin at a certain time. Less than this our fathers could not\r\ndo, and more they would not do. Necessity drove them so far, and farther\r\nthey would not go. But this is not all. The earliest Congress under the\r\nConstitution took the same view of slavery. They hedged and hemmed it in\r\nto the narrowest limits of necessity.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 they prohibited an outgoing slave trade--that is, the taking\r\nof slaves from the United States to sell. In 1798 they prohibited the\r\nbringing of slaves from Africa into the Mississippi Territory, this\r\nTerritory then comprising what are now the States of Mississippi and\r\nAlabama. This was ten years before they had the authority to do the same\r\nthing as to the States existing at the adoption of the Constitution. In\r\n1800 they prohibited American citizens from trading in slaves between\r\nforeign countries, as, for instance, from Africa to Brazil. In 1803 they\r\npassed a law in aid of one or two slave-State laws in restraint of the\r\ninternal slave trade. In 1807, in apparent hot haste, they passed the law,\r\nnearly a year in advance,--to take effect the first day of 1808, the very\r\nfirst day the Constitution would permit, prohibiting the African slave\r\ntrade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalties. In 1820, finding these\r\nprovisions ineffectual, they declared the slave trade piracy, and annexed\r\nto it the extreme penalty of death. While all this was passing in the\r\nGeneral Government, five or six of the original slave States had adopted\r\nsystems of gradual emancipation, by which the institution was rapidly\r\nbecoming extinct within their limits. Thus we see that the plain,\r\nunmistakable spirit of that age toward slavery was hostility to the\r\nprinciple and toleration only by necessity.\r\n\r\nBut now it is to be transformed into a \"sacred right.\" Nebraska brings it\r\nforth, places it on the highroad to extension and perpetuity, and with a\r\npat on its back says to it, \"Go, and God speed you.\" Henceforth it is\r\nto be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure-head of the ship of\r\nstate. Little by little, but steadily as man's march to the grave, we have\r\nbeen giving up the old for the new faith. Near eighty years ago we began\r\nby declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning\r\nwe have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave\r\nothers is a \"sacred right of self-government.\" These principles cannot\r\nstand together. They are as opposite as God and Mammon; and who ever holds\r\nto the one must despise the other. When Pettit, in connection with his\r\nsupport of the Nebraska Bill, called the Declaration of Independence \"a\r\nself-evident lie,\" he only did what consistency and candor require all\r\nother Nebraska men to do. Of the forty-odd Nebraska senators who sat\r\npresent and heard him, no one rebuked him. Nor am I apprised that any\r\nNebraska newspaper, or any Nebraska orator, in the whole nation has ever\r\nyet rebuked him. If this had been said among Marion's men, Southerners\r\nthough they were, what would have become of the man who said it? If this\r\nhad been said to the men who captured Andre, the man who said it would\r\nprobably have been hung sooner than Andre was. If it had been said in old\r\nIndependence Hall seventy-eight years ago, the very doorkeeper would have\r\nthrottled the man and thrust him into the street. Let no one be\r\ndeceived. The spirit of seventy-six and the spirit of Nebraska are utter\r\nantagonisms; and the former is being rapidly displaced by the latter.\r\n\r\nFellow-countrymen, Americans, South as well as North, shall we make no\r\neffort to arrest this? Already the liberal party throughout the world\r\nexpress the apprehension that \"the one retrograde institution in America\r\nis undermining the principles of progress, and fatally violating the\r\nnoblest political system the world ever saw.\" This is not the taunt of\r\nenemies, but the warning of friends. Is it quite safe to disregard\r\nit--to despise it? Is there no danger to liberty itself in discarding the\r\nearliest practice and first precept of our ancient faith? In our greedy\r\nchase to make profit of the negro, let us beware lest we \"cancel and tear\r\nin pieces\" even the white man's charter of freedom.\r\n\r\nOur republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust. Let us repurify\r\nit. Let us turn and wash it white in the spirit, if not the blood, of the\r\nRevolution. Let us turn slavery from its claims of \"moral right,\" back\r\nupon its existing legal rights and its arguments of \"necessity.\" Let us\r\nreturn it to the position our fathers gave it, and there let it rest in\r\npeace. Let us readopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the\r\npractices and policy which harmonize with it. Let North and South, let all\r\nAmericans--let all lovers of liberty everywhere join in the great and good\r\nwork. If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union, but we shall\r\nhave so saved it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving.\r\nWe shall have so saved it that the succeeding millions of free happy\r\npeople the world over shall rise up and call us blessed to the latest\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nAt Springfield, twelve days ago, where I had spoken substantially as I\r\nhave here, Judge Douglas replied to me; and as he is to reply to me here,\r\nI shall attempt to anticipate him by noticing some of the points he made\r\nthere. He commenced by stating I had assumed all the way through that the\r\nprinciple of the Nebraska Bill would have the effect of extending slavery.\r\nHe denied that this was intended or that this effect would follow.\r\n\r\nI will not reopen the argument upon this point. That such was the\r\nintention the world believed at the start, and will continue to believe.\r\nThis was the countenance of the thing, and both friends and enemies\r\ninstantly recognized it as such. That countenance cannot now be changed by\r\nargument. You can as easily argue the color out of the negro's skin. Like\r\nthe \"bloody hand,\" you may wash it and wash it, the red witness of guilt\r\nstill sticks and stares horribly at you.\r\n\r\nNext he says that Congressional intervention never prevented slavery\r\nanywhere; that it did not prevent it in the Northwestern Territory, nor\r\nin Illinois; that, in fact, Illinois came into the Union as a slave State;\r\nthat the principle of the Nebraska Bill expelled it from Illinois, from\r\nseveral old States, from everywhere.\r\n\r\nNow this is mere quibbling all the way through. If the Ordinance of '87\r\ndid not keep slavery out of the Northwest Territory, how happens it that\r\nthe northwest shore of the Ohio River is entirely free from it, while the\r\nsoutheast shore, less than a mile distant, along nearly the whole length\r\nof the river, is entirely covered with it?\r\n\r\nIf that ordinance did not keep it out of Illinois, what was it that made\r\nthe difference between Illinois and Missouri? They lie side by side, the\r\nMississippi River only dividing them, while their early settlements were\r\nwithin the same latitude. Between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves in\r\nMissouri increased 7211, while in Illinois in the same ten years they\r\ndecreased 51. This appears by the census returns. During nearly all of\r\nthat ten years both were Territories, not States. During this time the\r\nordinance forbade slavery to go into Illinois, and nothing forbade it to\r\ngo into Missouri. It did go into Missouri, and did not go into Illinois.\r\nThat is the fact. Can any one doubt as to the reason of it? But he says\r\nIllinois came into the Union as a slave State. Silence, perhaps, would\r\nbe the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of the\r\ncountry. What are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based? When\r\nwe first acquired the country, as far back as 1787, there were some slaves\r\nwithin it held by the French inhabitants of Kaskaskia. The territorial\r\nlegislation admitted a few negroes from the slave States as indentured\r\nservants. One year after the adoption of the first State constitution,\r\nthe whole number of them was--what do you think? Just one hundred and\r\nseventeen, while the aggregate free population was 55,094,--about four\r\nhundred and seventy to one. Upon this state of facts the people framed\r\ntheir constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery, with\r\na sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants, giving\r\nfreedom to their children to be born thereafter, and making no mention\r\nwhatever of any supposed slave for life. Out of this small matter the\r\nJudge manufactures his argument that Illinois came into the Union as a\r\nslave State. Let the facts be the answer to the argument.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the Nebraska Bill, he says, expelled slavery from\r\nIllinois. The principle of that bill first planted it here--that is, it\r\nfirst came because there was no law to prevent it, first came before we\r\nowned the country; and finding it here, and having the Ordinance of '87 to\r\nprevent its increasing, our people struggled along, and finally got rid of\r\nit as best they could.\r\n\r\nBut the principle of the Nebraska Bill abolished slavery in several of the\r\nold States. Well, it is true that several of the old States, in the last\r\nquarter of the last century, did adopt systems of gradual emancipation by\r\nwhich the institution has finally become extinct within their limits; but\r\nit may or may not be true that the principle of the Nebraska Bill was\r\nthe cause that led to the adoption of these measures. It is now more\r\nthan fifty years since the last of these States adopted its system of\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nIf the Nebraska Bill is the real author of the benevolent works, it\r\nis rather deplorable that it has for so long a time ceased working\r\naltogether. Is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principle\r\nof the Revolution, and not the principle of the Nebraska Bill, that led\r\nto emancipation in these old States? Leave it to the people of these old\r\nemancipating States, and I am quite certain they will decide that neither\r\nthat nor any other good thing ever did or ever will come of the Nebraska\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my main argument, Judge Douglas interrupted me to say\r\nthat the principle of the Nebraska Bill was very old; that it originated\r\nwhen God made man, and placed good and evil before him, allowing him to\r\nchoose for himself, being responsible for the choice he should make. At\r\nthe time I thought this was merely playful, and I answered it accordingly.\r\nBut in his reply to me he renewed it as a serious argument. In\r\nseriousness, then, the facts of this proposition are not true as stated.\r\nGod did not place good and evil before man, telling him to make his\r\nchoice. On the contrary, he did tell him there was one tree of the fruit\r\nof which he should not eat, upon pain of certain death. I should scarcely\r\nwish so strong a prohibition against slavery in Nebraska.\r\n\r\nBut this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in another\r\nparticular--in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the \"divine\r\nright of kings.\" By the latter, the king is to do just as he pleases with\r\nhis white subjects, being responsible to God alone. By the former,\r\nthe white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves, being\r\nresponsible to God alone. The two things are precisely alike, and it is\r\nbut natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them.\r\n\r\nI had argued that the application of the principle of self-government, as\r\ncontended for, would require the revival of the African slave trade; that\r\nno argument could be made in favor of a man's right to take slaves to\r\nNebraska which could not be equally well made in favor of his right\r\nto bring them from the coast of Africa. The Judge replied that the\r\nConstitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade, but\r\ndoes not require the prohibition of slavery in the Territories. That is a\r\nmistake in point of fact. The Constitution does not require the action of\r\nCongress in either case, and it does authorize it in both. And so there is\r\nstill no difference between the cases.\r\n\r\nIn regard to what I have said of the advantage the slave States have over\r\nthe free in the matter of representation, the Judge replied that we in\r\nthe free States count five free negroes as five white people, while in\r\nthe slave States they count five slaves as three whites only; and that the\r\nadvantage, at last, was on the side of the free States.\r\n\r\nNow, in the slave States they count free negroes just as we do; and it so\r\nhappens that, besides their slaves, they have as many free negroes as we\r\nhave, and thirty thousand over. Thus, their free negroes more than balance\r\nours; and their advantage over us, in consequence of their slaves, still\r\nremains as I stated it.\r\n\r\nIn reply to my argument that the compromise measures of 1850 were a system\r\nof equivalents, and that the provisions of no one of them could fairly\r\nbe carried to other subjects without its corresponding equivalent being\r\ncarried with it, the Judge denied outright that these measures had any\r\nconnection with or dependence upon each other. This is mere desperation.\r\nIf they had no connection, why are they always spoken of in connection?\r\nWhy has he so spoken of them a thousand times? Why has he constantly\r\ncalled them a series of measures? Why does everybody call them a\r\ncompromise? Why was California kept out of the Union six or seven months,\r\nif it was not because of its connection with the other measures? Webster's\r\nleading definition of the verb \"to compromise\" is \"to adjust and settle\r\na difference, by mutual agreement, with concessions of claims by the\r\nparties.\" This conveys precisely the popular understanding of the word\r\n\"compromise.\"\r\n\r\nWe knew, before the Judge told us, that these measures passed separately,\r\nand in distinct bills, and that no two of them were passed by the votes of\r\nprecisely the same members. But we also know, and so does he know, that\r\nno one of them could have passed both branches of Congress but for the\r\nunderstanding that the others were to pass also. Upon this understanding,\r\neach got votes which it could have got in no other way. It is this fact\r\nwhich gives to the measures their true character; and it is the universal\r\nknowledge of this fact that has given them the name of \"compromises,\" so\r\nexpressive of that true character.\r\n\r\nI had asked: \"If, in carrying the Utah and New Mexico laws to Nebraska,\r\nyou could clear away other objection, how could you leave Nebraska\r\n'perfectly free' to introduce slavery before she forms a constitution,\r\nduring her territorial government, while the Utah and New Mexico laws\r\nonly authorize it when they form constitutions and are admitted into the\r\nUnion?\" To this Judge Douglas answered that the Utah and New Mexico laws\r\nalso authorized it before; and to prove this he read from one of their\r\nlaws, as follows: \"That the legislative power of said Territory shall\r\nextend to all rightful subjects of legislation, consistent with the\r\nConstitution of the United States and the provisions of this act.\"\r\n\r\nNow it is perceived from the reading of this that there is nothing express\r\nupon the subject, but that the authority is sought to be implied merely\r\nfor the general provision of \"all rightful subjects of legislation.\" In\r\nreply to this I insist, as a legal rule of construction, as well as the\r\nplain, popular view of the matter, that the express provision for Utah and\r\nNew Mexico coming in with slavery, if they choose, when they shall form\r\nconstitutions, is an exclusion of all implied authority on the same\r\nsubject; that Congress having the subject distinctly in their minds\r\nwhen they made the express provision, they therein expressed their whole\r\nmeaning on that subject.\r\n\r\nThe Judge rather insinuated that I had found it convenient to forget the\r\nWashington territorial law passed in 1853. This was a division of Oregon,\r\norganizing the northern part as the Territory of Washington. He asserted\r\nthat by this act the Ordinance of '87, theretofore existing in Oregon, was\r\nrepealed; that nearly all the members of Congress voted for it, beginning\r\nin the House of Representatives with Charles Allen of Massachusetts, and\r\nending with Richard Yates of Illinois; and that he could not understand\r\nhow those who now opposed the Nebraska Bill so voted there, unless it was\r\nbecause it was then too soon after both the great political parties had\r\nratified the compromises of 1850, and the ratification therefore was too\r\nfresh to be then repudiated.\r\n\r\nNow I had seen the Washington act before, and I have carefully examined it\r\nsince; and I aver that there is no repeal of the Ordinance of '87, or of\r\nany prohibition of slavery, in it. In express terms, there is absolutely\r\nnothing in the whole law upon the subject--in fact, nothing to lead a\r\nreader to think of the subject. To my judgment it is equally free from\r\neverything from which repeal can be legally implied; but, however this\r\nmay be, are men now to be entrapped by a legal implication, extracted from\r\ncovert language, introduced perhaps for the very purpose of entrapping\r\nthem? I sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through,\r\ncarefully watching every sentence and every line for a repeal of the\r\nOrdinance of '87, or anything equivalent to it.\r\n\r\nAnother point on the Washington act: If it was intended to be modeled\r\nafter the Utah and New Mexico acts, as Judge Douglas insists, why was it\r\nnot inserted in it, as in them, that Washington was to come in with or\r\nwithout slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution?\r\nIt has no such provision in it; and I defy the ingenuity of man to give a\r\nreason for the omission, other than that it was not intended to follow the\r\nUtah and New Mexico laws in regard to the question of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Washington act not only differs vitally from the Utah and New Mexico\r\nacts, but the Nebraska act differs vitally from both. By the latter\r\nact the people are left \"perfectly free\" to regulate their own domestic\r\nconcerns, etc.; but in all the former, all their laws are to be submitted\r\nto Congress, and if disapproved are to be null. The Washington act goes\r\neven further; it absolutely prohibits the territorial Legislature, by very\r\nstrong and guarded language, from establishing banks or borrowing money on\r\nthe faith of the Territory. Is this the sacred right of self-government\r\nwe hear vaunted so much? No, sir; the Nebraska Bill finds no model in the\r\nacts of '50 or the Washington act. It finds no model in any law from Adam\r\ntill to-day. As Phillips says of Napoleon, the Nebraska act is grand,\r\ngloomy and peculiar, wrapped in the solitude of its own originality,\r\nwithout a model and without a shadow upon the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his reply Senator Douglas remarked in substance that he\r\nhad always considered this government was made for the white people and\r\nnot for the negroes. Why, in point of mere fact, I think so too. But in\r\nthis remark of the Judge there is a significance which I think is the key\r\nto the great mistake (if there is any such mistake) which he has made\r\nin this Nebraska measure. It shows that the Judge has no very vivid\r\nimpression that the negro is human, and consequently has no idea that\r\nthere can be any moral question in legislating about him. In his view the\r\nquestion of whether a new country shall be slave or free is a matter of as\r\nutter indifference as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with\r\ntobacco or stock it with horned cattle. Now, whether this view is right\r\nor wrong, it is very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally\r\ndifferent view. They consider slavery a great moral wrong, and their\r\nfeeling against it is not evanescent, but eternal. It lies at the very\r\nfoundation of their sense of justice, and it cannot be trifled with. It\r\nis a great and durable element of popular action, and I think no statesman\r\ncan safely disregard it.\r\n\r\nOur Senator also objects that those who oppose him in this matter do not\r\nentirely agree with one another. He reminds me that in my firm adherence\r\nto the constitutional rights of the slave States I differ widely from\r\nothers who are cooperating with me in opposing the Nebraska Bill, and he\r\nsays it is not quite fair to oppose him in this variety of ways. He should\r\nremember that he took us by surprise--astounded us by this measure. We\r\nwere thunderstruck and stunned, and we reeled and fell in utter confusion.\r\nBut we rose, each fighting, grasping whatever he could first reach--a\r\nscythe, a pitchfork, a chopping-ax, or a butcher's cleaver. We struck in\r\nthe direction of the sound, and we were rapidly closing in upon him. He\r\nmust not think to divert us from our purpose by showing us that our drill,\r\nour dress, and our weapons are not entirely perfect and uniform. When the\r\nstorm shall be past he shall find us still Americans, no less devoted to\r\nthe continued union and prosperity of the country than heretofore.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Judge invokes against me the memory of Clay and Webster, They\r\nwere great men, and men of great deeds. But where have I assailed them?\r\nFor what is it that their lifelong enemy shall now make profit by assuming\r\nto defend them against me, their lifelong friend? I go against the repeal\r\nof the Missouri Compromise; did they ever go for it? They went for the\r\nCompromise of 1850; did I ever go against them? They were greatly devoted\r\nto the Union; to the small measure of my ability was I ever less so? Clay\r\nand Webster were dead before this question arose; by what authority shall\r\nour Senator say they would espouse his side of it if alive? Mr. Clay was\r\nthe leading spirit in making the Missouri Compromise; is it very credible\r\nthat if now alive he would take the lead in the breaking of it? The truth\r\nis that some support from Whigs is now a necessity with the Judge, and for\r\nthis it is that the names of Clay and Webster are invoked. His old friends\r\nhave deserted him in such numbers as to leave too few to live by. He\r\ncame to his own, and his own received him not; and lo! he turns unto the\r\nGentiles.\r\n\r\nA word now as to the Judge's desperate assumption that the compromises of\r\n1850 had no connection with one another; that Illinois came into the Union\r\nas a slave State, and some other similar ones. This is no other than a\r\nbold denial of the history of the country. If we do not know that the\r\ncompromises of 1850 were dependent on each other; if we do not know that\r\nIllinois came into the Union as a free State,--we do not know anything.\r\nIf we do not know these things, we do not know that we ever had a\r\nRevolutionary War or such a chief as Washington. To deny these things is\r\nto deny our national axioms,--or dogmas, at least,--and it puts an end to\r\nall argument. If a man will stand up and assert, and repeat and reassert,\r\nthat two and two do not make four, I know nothing in the power of argument\r\nthat can stop him. I think I can answer the Judge so long as he sticks to\r\nthe premises; but when he flies from them, I cannot work any argument into\r\nthe consistency of a mental gag and actually close his mouth with it. In\r\nsuch a case I can only commend him to the seventy thousand answers just in\r\nfrom Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR SENATE SUPPORT\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES HOYT\r\n\r\nCLINTON, De WITT Co., Nov. 10, 1854\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--You used to express a good deal of partiality for me, and if\r\nyou are still so, now is the time. Some friends here are really for me for\r\nthe U.S. Senate, and I should be very grateful if you could make a mark\r\nfor me among your members. Please write me at all events, giving me the\r\nnames, post-offices, and \"political position\" of members round about you.\r\nDirect to Springfield.\r\n\r\nLet this be confidential.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. J. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD,\r\n\r\nNovember 27, 1854 T. J. HENDERSON, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--It has come round that a whig may, by possibility, be\r\nelected to the United States Senate, and I want the chance of being the\r\nman. You are a member of the Legislature, and have a vote to give. Think\r\nit over, and see whether you can do better than to go for me.\r\n\r\nWrite me, at all events; and let this be confidential.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. 1, 1854.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I have really got it into my head to try to be United States\r\nSenator, and, if I could have your support, my chances would be reasonably\r\ngood. But I know, and acknowledge, that you have as just claims to the\r\nplace as I have; and therefore I cannot ask you to yield to me, if you are\r\nthinking of becoming a candidate, yourself. If, however, you are not, then\r\nI should like to be remembered affectionately by you; and also to have you\r\nmake a mark for me with the Anti-Nebraska members down your way.\r\n\r\nIf you know, and have no objection to tell, let me know whether Trumbull\r\nintends to make a push. If he does, I suppose the two men in St. Clair,\r\nand one, or both, in Madison, will be for him. We have the Legislature,\r\nclearly enough, on joint ballot, but the Senate is very close, and Cullom\r\ntold me to-day that the Nebraska men will stave off the election, if they\r\ncan. Even if we get into joint vote, we shall have difficulty to unite our\r\nforces. Please write me, and let this be confidential.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL REFERENCES\r\n\r\nTO JUSTICE MCLEAN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., December 6, 1854.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I understand it is in contemplation to displace the present clerk\r\nand appoint a new one for the Circuit and District Courts of Illinois. I\r\nam very friendly to the present incumbent, and, both for his own sake and\r\nthat of his family, I wish him to be retained so long as it is possible\r\nfor the court to do so.\r\n\r\nIn the contingency of his removal, however, I have recommended William\r\nButler as his successor, and I do not wish what I write now to be taken as\r\nany abatement of that recommendation.\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Black is also an applicant for the appointment, and I write\r\nthis at the solicitation of his friends to say that he is every way worthy\r\nof the office, and that I doubt not the conferring it upon him will give\r\ngreat satisfaction.\r\n\r\nYour ob't servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. J. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, December 15. 1854\r\n\r\nHON. T. J. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 11th was received last night, and for which I\r\nthank you. Of course I prefer myself to all others; yet it is neither in\r\nmy heart nor my conscience to say I am any better man than Mr. Williams.\r\nWe shall have a terrible struggle with our adversaries. They are desperate\r\nand bent on desperate deeds. I accidentally learned of one of the leaders\r\nhere writing to a member south of here, in about the following language:\r\n\r\nWe are beaten. They have a clean majority of at least nine, on joint\r\nballot. They outnumber us, but we must outmanage them. Douglas must be\r\nsustained. We must elect the Speaker; and we must elect a Nebraska United\r\nStates Senator, or \"elect none at all.\" Similar letters, no doubt, are\r\nwritten to every Nebraska member. Be considering how we can best meet, and\r\nfoil, and beat them. I send you, by mail, a copy of my Peoria speech. You\r\nmay have seen it before, or you may not think it worth seeing now.\r\n\r\nDo not speak of the Nebraska letter mentioned above; I do not wish it to\r\nbecome public, that I received such information.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF PRIMARY FOR SENATOR\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, February 9, 1855 MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nI began with 44 votes, Shields 41, and Trumbull 5,--yet Trumbull was\r\nelected. In fact 47 different members voted for me,--getting three new\r\nones on the second ballot, and losing four old ones. How came my 47\r\nto yield to Trumbull's 5? It was Governor Matteson's work. He has been\r\nsecretly a candidate ever since (before, even) the fall election.\r\n\r\nAll the members round about the canal were Anti-Nebraska, but were\r\nnevertheless nearly all Democrats and old personal friends of his. His\r\nplan was to privately impress them with the belief that he was as good\r\nAnti-Nebraska as any one else--at least could be secured to be so by\r\ninstructions, which could be easily passed.\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska men, of course, were not for Matteson; but when they found\r\nthey could elect no avowed Nebraska man, they tardily determined to let\r\nhim get whomever of our men he could, by whatever means he could, and ask\r\nhim no questions.\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska men were very confident of the election of Matteson, though\r\ndenying that he was a candidate, and we very much believing also that they\r\nwould elect him. But they wanted first to make a show of good faith to\r\nShields by voting for him a few times, and our secret Matteson men also\r\nwanted to make a show of good faith by voting with us a few times. So\r\nwe led off. On the seventh ballot, I think, the signal was given to the\r\nNebraska men to turn to Matteson, which they acted on to a man, with one\r\nexception. . . Next ballot the remaining Nebraska man and one pretended\r\nAnti went over to him, giving him 46. The next still another, giving him\r\n47, wanting only three of an election. In the meantime our friends, with\r\na view of detaining our expected bolters, had been turning from me to\r\nTrumbull till he had risen to 35 and I had been reduced to 15. These would\r\nnever desert me except by my direction; but I became satisfied that if we\r\ncould prevent Matteson's election one or two ballots more, we could not\r\npossibly do so a single ballot after my friends should begin to return\r\nto me from Trumbull. So I determined to strike at once, and accordingly\r\nadvised my remaining friends to go for him, which they did and elected him\r\non the tenth ballot.\r\n\r\nSuch is the way the thing was done. I think you would have done the same\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\nI could have headed off every combination and been elected, had it not\r\nbeen for Matteson's double game--and his defeat now gives me more pleasure\r\nthan my own gives me pain. On the whole, it is perhaps as well for our\r\ngeneral cause that Trumbull is elected. The Nebraska men confess that\r\nthey hate it worse than anything that could have happened. It is a great\r\nconsolation to see them worse whipped than I am.\r\n\r\nYours forever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURN TO LAW PROFESSION\r\n\r\nTO SANFORD, PORTER, AND STRIKER, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, MARCH 10, 1855\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Yours of the 5th is received, as also was that of 15th Dec,\r\nlast, inclosing bond of Clift to Pray. When I received the bond I was\r\ndabbling in politics, and of course neglecting business. Having since been\r\nbeaten out I have gone to work again.\r\n\r\nAs I do not practice in Rushville, I to-day open a correspondence with\r\nHenry E. Dummer, Esq., of Beardstown, Ill., with the view of getting the\r\njob into his hands. He is a good man if he will undertake it.\r\n\r\nWrite me whether I shall do this or return the bond to you.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO O. H. BROWNING.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 23, 1855.\r\n\r\nHON. O. H. BROWNING.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter to Judge Logan has been shown to us by him; and,\r\nwith his consent, we answer it. When it became probable that there would\r\nbe a vacancy on the Supreme Bench, public opinion, on this side of the\r\nriver, seemed to be universally directed to Logan as the proper man to\r\nfill it. I mean public opinion on our side in politics, with very small\r\nmanifestation in any different direction by the other side. The result is,\r\nthat he has been a good deal pressed to allow his name to be used, and he\r\nhas consented to it, provided it can be done with perfect cordiality and\r\ngood feeling on the part of all our own friends. We, the undersigned, are\r\nvery anxious for it; and the more so now that he has been urged, until\r\nhis mind is turned upon the matter. We, therefore are very glad of your\r\nletter, with the information it brings us, mixed only with a regret that\r\nwe can not elect Logan and Walker both. We shall be glad, if you will\r\nhoist Logan's name, in your Quincy papers.\r\n\r\nVery truly your friends,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, B. S. EWARDS, JOHN T. STUART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 7, 1855.\r\n\r\nH. C. WHITNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your note containing election news is received; and for\r\nwhich I thank you. It is all of no use, however. Logan is worse beaten\r\nthan any other man ever was since elections were invented--beaten more\r\nthan twelve hundred in this county. It is conceded on all hands that the\r\nProhibitory law is also beaten.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A PRO-SLAVERY FRIEND\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA. F. SPEED.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, August 24, 1855\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--You know what a poor correspondent I am. Ever since I\r\nreceived your very agreeable letter of the 22d of May, I have been\r\nintending to write you an answer to it. You suggest that in political\r\naction, now, you and I would differ. I suppose we would; not quite as\r\nmuch, however, as you may think. You know I dislike slavery, and you fully\r\nadmit the abstract wrong of it. So far there is no cause of difference.\r\nBut you say that sooner than yield your legal right to the slave,\r\nespecially at the bidding of those who are not themselves interested, you\r\nwould see the Union dissolved. I am not aware that any one is bidding you\r\nyield that right; very certainly I am not. I leave that matter entirely\r\nto yourself. I also acknowledge your rights and my obligations under the\r\nConstitution in regard to your slaves. I confess I hate to see the poor\r\ncreatures hunted down and caught and carried back to their stripes and\r\nunrequited toil; but I bite my lips and keep quiet. In 1841 you and I had\r\ntogether a tedious low-water trip on a steamboat from Louisville to St.\r\nLouis. You may remember, as I well do, that from Louisville to the mouth\r\nof the Ohio there were on board ten or a dozen slaves shackled together\r\nwith irons. That sight was a continued torment to me, and I see something\r\nlike it every time I touch the Ohio or any other slave border. It is not\r\nfair for you to assume that I have no interest in a thing which has, and\r\ncontinually exercises, the power of making me miserable. You ought rather\r\nto appreciate how much the great body of the Northern people do crucify\r\ntheir feelings, in order to maintain their loyalty to the Constitution and\r\nthe Union. I do oppose the extension of slavery because my judgment and\r\nfeeling so prompt me, and I am under no obligations to the contrary.\r\nIf for this you and I must differ, differ we must. You say, if you were\r\nPresident, you would send an army and hang the leaders of the Missouri\r\noutrages upon the Kansas elections; still, if Kansas fairly votes herself\r\na slave State she must be admitted or the Union must be dissolved. But how\r\nif she votes herself a slave State unfairly, that is, by the very means\r\nfor which you say you would hang men? Must she still be admitted, or the\r\nUnion dissolved? That will be the phase of the question when it first\r\nbecomes a practical one. In your assumption that there may be a fair\r\ndecision of the slavery question in Kansas, I plainly see you and I would\r\ndiffer about the Nebraska law. I look upon that enactment not as a law,\r\nbut as a violence from the beginning. It was conceived in violence, is\r\nmaintained in violence, and is being executed in violence. I say it was\r\nconceived in violence, because the destruction of the Missouri Compromise,\r\nunder the circumstances, was nothing less than violence. It was passed in\r\nviolence because it could not have passed at all but for the votes of\r\nmany members in violence of the known will of their constituents. It is\r\nmaintained in violence, because the elections since clearly demand its\r\nrepeal; and the demand is openly disregarded.\r\n\r\nYou say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing the law; I say\r\nthe way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its antecedents.\r\nIt is being executed in the precise way which was intended from the first,\r\nelse why does no Nebraska man express astonishment or condemnation? Poor\r\nReeder is the only public man who has been silly enough to believe\r\nthat anything like fairness was ever intended, and he has been bravely\r\nundeceived.\r\n\r\nThat Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with it will ask to be\r\nadmitted into the Union, I take to be already a settled question, and so\r\nsettled by the very means you so pointedly condemn. By every principle of\r\nlaw ever held by any court North or South, every negro taken to Kansas\r\nis free; yet, in utter disregard of this,--in the spirit of violence\r\nmerely,--that beautiful Legislature gravely passes a law to hang any\r\nman who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights. This is the\r\nsubject and real object of the law. If, like Haman, they should hang upon\r\nthe gallows of their own building, I shall not be among the mourners for\r\ntheir fate. In my humble sphere, I shall advocate the restoration of the\r\nMissouri Compromise so long as Kansas remains a Territory, and when, by\r\nall these foul means, it seeks to come into the Union as a slave State, I\r\nshall oppose it. I am very loath in any case to withhold my assent to\r\nthe enjoyment of property acquired or located in good faith; but I do not\r\nadmit that good faith in taking a negro to Kansas to be held in slavery\r\nis a probability with any man. Any man who has sense enough to be the\r\ncontroller of his own property has too much sense to misunderstand the\r\noutrageous character of the whole Nebraska business. But I digress. In my\r\nopposition to the admission of Kansas I shall have some company, but we\r\nmay be beaten. If we are, I shall not on that account attempt to dissolve\r\nthe Union. I think it probable, however, we shall be beaten. Standing as\r\na unit among yourselves, You can, directly and indirectly, bribe enough\r\nof our men to carry the day, as you could on the open proposition to\r\nestablish a monarchy. Get hold of some man in the North whose position and\r\nability is such that he can make the support of your measure, whatever it\r\nmay be, a Democratic party necessity, and the thing is done. Apropos of\r\nthis, let me tell you an anecdote. Douglas introduced the Nebraska Bill in\r\nJanuary. In February afterward there was a called session of the Illinois\r\nLegislature. Of the one hundred members composing the two branches of that\r\nbody, about seventy were Democrats. These latter held a caucus in which\r\nthe Nebraska Bill was talked of, if not formally discussed. It was thereby\r\ndiscovered that just three, and no more, were in favor of the measure. In\r\na day or two Douglas's orders came on to have resolutions passed approving\r\nthe bill; and they were passed by large majorities!!!! The truth of this\r\nis vouched for by a bolting Democratic member. The masses, too, Democratic\r\nas well as Whig, were even nearer unanimous against it; but, as soon\r\nas the party necessity of supporting it became apparent, the way the\r\nDemocrats began to see the wisdom and justice of it was perfectly\r\nastonishing.\r\n\r\nYou say that if Kansas fairly votes herself a free State, as a Christian\r\nyou will rejoice at it. All decent slaveholders talk that way, and I\r\ndo not doubt their candor. But they never vote that way. Although in\r\na private letter or conversation you will express your preference that\r\nKansas shall be free, you would vote for no man for Congress who would say\r\nthe same thing publicly. No such man could be elected from any district\r\nin a slave State. You think Stringfellow and company ought to be hung; and\r\nyet at the next Presidential election you will vote for the exact type and\r\nrepresentative of Stringfellow. The slave-breeders and slave-traders are\r\na small, odious, and detested class among you; and yet in politics they\r\ndictate the course of all of you, and are as completely your masters as\r\nyou are the master of your own negroes. You inquire where I now stand.\r\nThat is a disputed point. I think I am a Whig; but others say there are\r\nno Whigs, and that I am an Abolitionist. When I was at Washington, I voted\r\nfor the Wilmot Proviso as good as forty times; and I never heard of any\r\none attempting to un-Whig me for that. I now do no more than oppose the\r\nextension of slavery. I am not a Know-Nothing; that is certain. How could\r\nI be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be in favor of\r\ndegrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to\r\nme to be pretty rapid. As a nation we began by declaring that \"all men\r\nare created equal.\" We now practically read it \"all men are created equal,\r\nexcept negroes.\" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \"all men\r\nare created equal, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.\" When it\r\ncomes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make\r\nno pretense of loving liberty,--to Russia, for instance, where despotism\r\ncan be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nMary will probably pass a day or two in Louisville in October. My kindest\r\nregards to Mrs. Speed. On the leading subject of this letter I have more\r\nof her sympathy than I have of yours; and yet let me say I am,\r\n\r\nYour friend forever,\r\n\r\nA.

MORGAN, ESQ.:\r\n\r\nSays Tom to John, \"Here's your old rotten wheelbarrow. I've broke it usin'\r\non it. I wish you would mend it, 'case I shall want to borrow it this\r\narternoon.\" Acting on this as a precedent, I say, \"Here's your old\r\n'chalked hat,--I wish you would take it and send me a new one, 'case I\r\nshall want to use it the first of March.\"\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n(A 'chalked hat' was the common term, at that time, for a railroad pass.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH DELIVERED BEFORE THE FIRST REPUBLICAN STATE CONVENTION\r\n\r\nOF ILLINOIS, HELD AT BLOOMINGTON, ON MAY 29, 1856.\r\n\r\n[From the Report by William C. Whitney.]\r\n\r\n(Mr. Whitney's notes were made at the time, but not written out until\r\n1896. He does not claim that the speech, as here reported, is literally\r\ncorrect only that he has followed the argument, and that in many cases the\r\nsentences are as Mr. Lincoln spoke them.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN: I was over at [Cries of \"Platform!\" \"Take\r\nthe platform!\"]--I say, that while I was at Danville Court, some of our\r\nfriends of Anti-Nebraska got together in Springfield and elected me as one\r\ndelegate to represent old Sangamon with them in this convention, and I\r\nam here certainly as a sympathizer in this movement and by virtue of that\r\nmeeting and selection. But we can hardly be called delegates strictly,\r\ninasmuch as, properly speaking, we represent nobody but ourselves. I think\r\nit altogether fair to say that we have no Anti-Nebraska party in Sangamon,\r\nalthough there is a good deal of Anti-Nebraska feeling there; but I say\r\nfor myself, and I think I may speak also for my colleagues, that we who\r\nare here fully approve of the platform and of all that has been done [A\r\nvoice, \"Yes!\"], and even if we are not regularly delegates, it will be\r\nright for me to answer your call to speak. I suppose we truly stand for\r\nthe public sentiment of Sangamon on the great question of the repeal,\r\nalthough we do not yet represent many numbers who have taken a distinct\r\nposition on the question.\r\n\r\nWe are in a trying time--it ranges above mere party--and this movement\r\nto call a halt and turn our steps backward needs all the help and good\r\ncounsels it can get; for unless popular opinion makes itself very strongly\r\nfelt, and a change is made in our present course, blood will flow on\r\naccount of Nebraska, and brother's hands will be raised against brother!\r\n\r\n[The last sentence was uttered in such an earnest, impressive, if not,\r\nindeed, tragic, manner, as to make a cold chill creep over me. Others gave\r\na similar experience.]\r\n\r\nI have listened with great interest to the earnest appeal made to Illinois\r\nmen by the gentleman from Lawrence [James S. Emery] who has just addressed\r\nus so eloquently and forcibly. I was deeply moved by his statement of the\r\nwrongs done to free-State men out there. I think it just to say that all\r\ntrue men North should sympathize with them, and ought to be willing to\r\ndo any possible and needful thing to right their wrongs. But we must not\r\npromise what we ought not, lest we be called on to perform what we cannot;\r\nwe must be calm and moderate, and consider the whole difficulty, and\r\ndetermine what is possible and just. We must not be led by excitement\r\nand passion to do that which our sober judgments would not approve in our\r\ncooler moments. We have higher aims; we will have more serious business\r\nthan to dally with temporary measures.\r\n\r\nWe are here to stand firmly for a principle--to stand firmly for a right.\r\nWe know that great political and moral wrongs are done, and outrages\r\ncommitted, and we denounce those wrongs and outrages, although we cannot,\r\nat present, do much more. But we desire to reach out beyond those personal\r\noutrages and establish a rule that will apply to all, and so prevent any\r\nfuture outrages.\r\n\r\nWe have seen to-day that every shade of popular opinion is represented\r\nhere, with Freedom, or rather Free Soil, as the basis. We have come\r\ntogether as in some sort representatives of popular opinion against the\r\nextension of slavery into territory now free in fact as well as by law,\r\nand the pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are now no more.\r\nWe come--we are here assembled together--to protest as well as we can\r\nagainst a great wrong, and to take measures, as well as we now can, to\r\nmake that wrong right; to place the nation, as far as it may be possible\r\nnow, as it was before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise; and the plain\r\nway to do this is to restore the Compromise, and to demand and determine\r\nthat Kansas shall be free! [Immense applause.] While we affirm, and\r\nreaffirm, if necessary, our devotion to the principles of the Declaration\r\nof Independence, let our practical work here be limited to the above. We\r\nknow that there is not a perfect agreement of sentiment here on the public\r\nquestions which might be rightfully considered in this convention, and\r\nthat the indignation which we all must feel cannot be helped; but all of\r\nus must give up something for the good of the cause. There is one desire\r\nwhich is uppermost in the mind, one wish common to us all, to which no\r\ndissent will be made; and I counsel you earnestly to bury all resentment,\r\nto sink all personal feeling, make all things work to a common purpose in\r\nwhich we are united and agreed about, and which all present will agree is\r\nabsolutely necessary--which must be done by any rightful mode if there\r\nbe such: Slavery must be kept out of Kansas! [Applause.] The test--the\r\npinch--is right there. If we lose Kansas to freedom, an example will be\r\nset which will prove fatal to freedom in the end. We, therefore, in\r\nthe language of the Bible, must \"lay the axe to the root of the tree.\"\r\nTemporizing will not do longer; now is the time for decision--for firm,\r\npersistent, resolute action. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska Bill, or rather Nebraska law, is not one of wholesome\r\nlegislation, but was and is an act of legislative usurpation, whose\r\nresult, if not indeed intention, is to make slavery national; and unless\r\nheaded off in some effective way, we are in a fair way to see this land\r\nof boasted freedom converted into a land of slavery in fact. [Sensation.]\r\nJust open your two eyes, and see if this be not so. I need do no more than\r\nstate, to command universal approval, that almost the entire North, as\r\nwell as a large following in the border States, is radically opposed to\r\nthe planting of slavery in free territory. Probably in a popular vote\r\nthroughout the nation nine tenths of the voters in the free States, and\r\nat least one-half in the border States, if they could express their\r\nsentiments freely, would vote NO on such an issue; and it is safe to say\r\nthat two thirds of the votes of the entire nation would be opposed to it.\r\nAnd yet, in spite of this overbalancing of sentiment in this free country,\r\nwe are in a fair way to see Kansas present itself for admission as a slave\r\nState. Indeed, it is a felony, by the local law of Kansas, to deny that\r\nslavery exists there even now. By every principle of law, a negro in\r\nKansas is free; yet the bogus Legislature makes it an infamous crime to\r\ntell him that he is free!\r\n\r\nStatutes of Kansas, 1555, chapter 151, Sec. 12: If any free person, by\r\nspeaking or by writing, assert or maintain that persons have not the right\r\nto hold slaves in this Territory, or shall introduce into this Territory,\r\nprint, publish, write, circulate . . . any book, paper, magazine,\r\npamphlet, or circular containing any denial of the right of persons\r\nto hold slaves in this Territory such person shall be deemed guilty of\r\nfelony, and punished by imprisonment at hard labor for a term of not\r\nless than two years. Sec. 13. No person who is conscientiously opposed\r\nto holding slaves, or who does not admit the right to hold slaves in this\r\nTerritory, shall sit as a juror on the trial of any prosecution for any\r\nviolation of any Sections of this Act.\r\n\r\nThe party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe justice and liberty;\r\nfor it is a singular fact, but none the less a fact, and well known by the\r\nmost common experience, that men will do things under the terror of the\r\nparty lash that they would not on any account or for any consideration\r\ndo otherwise; while men who will march up to the mouth of a loaded cannon\r\nwithout shrinking will run from the terrible name of \"Abolitionist,\"\r\neven when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they, with good reason,\r\ndespise. For instance--to press this point a little--Judge Douglas\r\nintroduced his Nebraska Bill in January; and we had an extra session of\r\nour Legislature in the succeeding February, in which were seventy-five\r\nDemocrats; and at a party caucus, fully attended, there were just three\r\nvotes, out of the whole seventy-five, for the measure. But in a few days\r\norders came on from Washington, commanding them to approve the measure;\r\nthe party lash was applied, and it was brought up again in caucus,\r\nand passed by a large majority. The masses were against it, but party\r\nnecessity carried it; and it was passed through the lower house of\r\nCongress against the will of the people, for the same reason. Here is\r\nwhere the greatest danger lies that, while we profess to be a government\r\nof law and reason, law will give way to violence on demand of this\r\nawful and crushing power. Like the great Juggernaut--I think that is the\r\nname--the great idol, it crushes everything that comes in its way, and\r\nmakes a [?]--or, as I read once, in a blackletter law book, \"a slave is\r\na human being who is legally not a person but a thing.\" And if the\r\nsafeguards to liberty are broken down, as is now attempted, when they have\r\nmade things of all the free negroes, how long, think you, before they\r\nwill begin to make things of poor white men? [Applause.] Be not deceived.\r\nRevolutions do not go backward. The founder of the Democratic party\r\ndeclared that all men were created equal. His successor in the leadership\r\nhas written the word \"white\" before men, making it read \"all white men are\r\ncreated equal.\" Pray, will or may not the Know-Nothings, if they should\r\nget in power, add the word \"Protestant,\" making it read \"all Protestant\r\nwhite men...?\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in other\r\nquarters. John Pettit, whom Tom Benton paid his respects to, you will\r\nrecollect, calls the immortal Declaration \"a self-evident lie\"; while at\r\nthe birthplace of freedom--in the shadow of Bunker Hill and of the \"cradle\r\nof liberty,\" at the home of the Adamses and Warren and Otis--Choate,\r\nfrom our side of the house, dares to fritter away the birthday promise\r\nof liberty by proclaiming the Declaration to be \"a string of glittering\r\ngeneralities\"; and the Southern Whigs, working hand in hand with\r\nproslavery Democrats, are making Choate's theories practical. Thomas\r\nJefferson, a slaveholder, mindful of the moral element in slavery,\r\nsolemnly declared that he trembled for his country when he remembered that\r\nGod is just; while Judge Douglas, with an insignificant wave of the hand,\r\n\"don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down.\" Now, if slavery\r\nis right, or even negative, he has a right to treat it in this trifling\r\nmanner. But if it is a moral and political wrong, as all Christendom\r\nconsiders it to be, how can he answer to God for this attempt to spread\r\nand fortify it? [Applause.]\r\n\r\nBut no man, and Judge Douglas no more than any other, can maintain a\r\nnegative, or merely neutral, position on this question; and, accordingly,\r\nhe avows that the Union was made by white men and for white men and their\r\ndescendants. As matter of fact, the first branch of the proposition is\r\nhistorically true; the government was made by white men, and they were\r\nand are the superior race. This I admit. But the corner-stone of the\r\ngovernment, so to speak, was the declaration that \"all men are created\r\nequal,\" and all entitled to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nAnd not only so, but the framers of the Constitution were particular\r\nto keep out of that instrument the word \"slave,\" the reason being that\r\nslavery would ultimately come to an end, and they did not wish to have any\r\nreminder that in this free country human beings were ever prostituted to\r\nslavery. [Applause.] Nor is it any argument that we are superior and the\r\nnegro inferior--that he has but one talent while we have ten. Let the\r\nnegro possess the little he has in independence; if he has but one talent,\r\nhe should be permitted to keep the little he has. [Applause:] But slavery\r\nwill endure no test of reason or logic; and yet its advocates, like\r\nDouglas, use a sort of bastard logic, or noisy assumption it might better\r\nbe termed, like the above, in order to prepare the mind for the gradual,\r\nbut none the less certain, encroachments of the Moloch of slavery upon the\r\nfair domain of freedom. But however much you may argue upon it, or smother\r\nit in soft phrase, slavery can only be maintained by force--by violence.\r\nThe repeal of the Missouri Compromise was by violence. It was a violation\r\nof both law and the sacred obligations of honor, to overthrow and trample\r\nunder foot a solemn compromise, obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of\r\none of the fairest of our Western domains. Congress violated the will and\r\nconfidence of its constituents in voting for the bill; and while public\r\nsentiment, as shown by the elections of 1854, demanded the restoration of\r\nthis compromise, Congress violated its trust by refusing simply because it\r\nhad the force of numbers to hold on to it. And murderous violence is being\r\nused now, in order to force slavery on to Kansas; for it cannot be done in\r\nany other way. [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nThe necessary result was to establish the rule of violence--force, instead\r\nof the rule of law and reason; to perpetuate and spread slavery, and\r\nin time to make it general. We see it at both ends of the line. In\r\nWashington, on the very spot where the outrage was started, the fearless\r\nSumner is beaten to insensibility, and is now slowly dying; while senators\r\nwho claim to be gentlemen and Christians stood by, countenancing the\r\nact, and even applauding it afterward in their places in the Senate. Even\r\nDouglas, our man, saw it all and was within helping distance, yet let the\r\nmurderous blows fall unopposed. Then, at the other end of the line, at the\r\nvery time Sumner was being murdered, Lawrence was being destroyed for\r\nthe crime of freedom. It was the most prominent stronghold of liberty in\r\nKansas, and must give way to the all-dominating power of slavery. Only\r\ntwo days ago, Judge Trumbull found it necessary to propose a bill in the\r\nSenate to prevent a general civil war and to restore peace in Kansas.\r\n\r\nWe live in the midst of alarms; anxiety beclouds the future; we expect\r\nsome new disaster with each newspaper we read. Are we in a healthful\r\npolitical state? Are not the tendencies plain? Do not the signs of the\r\ntimes point plainly the way in which we are going? [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Constitution slavery was recognized, by South and\r\nNorth alike, as an evil, and the division of sentiment about it was not\r\ncontrolled by geographical lines or considerations of climate, but by\r\nmoral and philanthropic views. Petitions for the abolition of slavery were\r\npresented to the very first Congress by Virginia and Massachusetts alike.\r\nTo show the harmony which prevailed, I will state that a fugitive slave\r\nlaw was passed in 1793, with no dissenting voice in the Senate, and\r\nbut seven dissenting votes in the House. It was, however, a wise law,\r\nmoderate, and, under the Constitution, a just one. Twenty-five years\r\nlater, a more stringent law was proposed and defeated; and thirty-five\r\nyears after that, the present law, drafted by Mason of Virginia, was\r\npassed by Northern votes. I am not, just now, complaining of this law, but\r\nI am trying to show how the current sets; for the proposed law of 1817 was\r\nfar less offensive than the present one. In 1774 the Continental Congress\r\npledged itself, without a dissenting vote, to wholly discontinue the slave\r\ntrade, and to neither purchase nor import any slave; and less than three\r\nmonths before the passage of the Declaration of Independence, the same\r\nCongress which adopted that declaration unanimously resolved \"that no\r\nslave be imported into any of the thirteen United Colonies.\" [Great\r\napplause.]\r\n\r\nOn the second day of July, 1776, the draft of a Declaration of\r\nIndependence was reported to Congress by the committee, and in it the\r\nslave trade was characterized as \"an execrable commerce,\" as \"a piratical\r\nwarfare,\" as the \"opprobrium of infidel powers,\" and as \"a cruel war\r\nagainst human nature.\" [Applause.] All agreed on this except South\r\nCarolina and Georgia, and in order to preserve harmony, and from the\r\nnecessity of the case, these expressions were omitted. Indeed, abolition\r\nsocieties existed as far south as Virginia; and it is a well-known fact\r\nthat Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Lee, Henry, Mason, and Pendleton were\r\nqualified abolitionists, and much more radical on that subject than we\r\nof the Whig and Democratic parties claim to be to-day. On March 1, 1784,\r\nVirginia ceded to the confederation all its lands lying northwest of the\r\nOhio River. Jefferson, Chase of Maryland, and Howell of Rhode Island, as\r\na committee on that and territory thereafter to be ceded, reported that\r\nno slavery should exist after the year 1800. Had this report been adopted,\r\nnot only the Northwest, but Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi\r\nalso would have been free; but it required the assent of nine States to\r\nratify it. North Carolina was divided, and thus its vote was lost; and\r\nDelaware, Georgia, and New Jersey refused to vote. In point of fact, as it\r\nwas, it was assented to by six States. Three years later on a square vote\r\nto exclude slavery from the Northwest, only one vote, and that from New\r\nYork, was against it. And yet, thirty-seven years later, five thousand\r\ncitizens of Illinois, out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand,\r\ndeliberately, after a long and heated contest, voted to introduce slavery\r\nin Illinois; and, to-day, a large party in the free State of Illinois are\r\nwilling to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the fair domain of\r\nKansas, notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom long before its\r\nbirth as a political community. I repeat, therefore, the question: Is it\r\nnot plain in what direction we are tending? [Sensation.] In the colonial\r\ntime, Mason, Pendleton, and Jefferson were as hostile to slavery in\r\nVirginia as Otis, Ames, and the Adamses were in Massachusetts; and\r\nVirginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it as old Massachusetts\r\ndid. But circumstances were against them and they failed; but not that the\r\ngood will of its leading men was lacking. Yet within less than fifty years\r\nVirginia changed its tune, and made negro-breeding for the cotton and\r\nsugar States one of its leading industries. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\nIn the Constitutional Convention, George Mason of Virginia made a more\r\nviolent abolition speech than my friends Lovejoy or Codding would desire\r\nto make here to-day--a speech which could not be safely repeated anywhere\r\non Southern soil in this enlightened year. But, while there were some\r\ndifferences of opinion on this subject even then, discussion was allowed;\r\nbut as you see by the Kansas slave code, which, as you know, is the\r\nMissouri slave code, merely ferried across the river, it is a felony\r\nto even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of\r\nWashington and the Declaration of Independence. [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky--my State--in 1849, on a test vote, the mighty influence\r\nof Henry Clay and many other good then there could not get a symptom of\r\nexpression in favor of gradual emancipation on a plain issue of marching\r\ntoward the light of civilization with Ohio and Illinois; but the State of\r\nBoone and Hardin and Henry Clay, with a nigger under each arm, took the\r\nblack trail toward the deadly swamps of barbarism. Is there--can there\r\nbe--any doubt about this thing? And is there any doubt that we must all\r\nlay aside our prejudices and march, shoulder to shoulder, in the great\r\narmy of Freedom? [Applause.]\r\n\r\nEvery Fourth of July our young orators all proclaim this to be \"the land\r\nof the free and the home of the brave!\" Well, now, when you orators get\r\nthat off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like some\r\nold grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it? [Laughter.] How\r\nwould you like that? But suppose Kansas comes in as a slave State, and\r\nall the \"border ruffians\" have barbecues about it, and free-State men come\r\ntrailing back to the dishonored North, like whipped dogs with their tails\r\nbetween their legs, it is--ain't it?--evident that this is no more the\r\n\"land of the free\"; and if we let it go so, we won't dare to say \"home of\r\nthe brave\" out loud. [Sensation and confusion.]\r\n\r\nCan any man doubt that, even in spite of the people's will, slavery will\r\ntriumph through violence, unless that will be made manifest and enforced?\r\nEven Governor Reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in Kansas was\r\nto be fair, but he got his eyes open at last; and I believe that, as a\r\nresult of this moral and physical violence, Kansas will soon apply for\r\nadmission as a slave State. And yet we can't mistake that the people\r\ndon't want it so, and that it is a land which is free both by natural\r\nand political law. No law, is free law! Such is the understanding of all\r\nChristendom. In the Somerset case, decided nearly a century ago, the great\r\nLord Mansfield held that slavery was of such a nature that it must take\r\nits rise in positive (as distinguished from natural) law; and that in no\r\ncountry or age could it be traced back to any other source. Will some\r\none please tell me where is the positive law that establishes slavery in\r\nKansas? [A voice: \"The bogus laws.\"] Aye, the bogus laws! And, on the same\r\nprinciple, a gang of Missouri horse-thieves could come into Illinois and\r\ndeclare horse-stealing to be legal [Laughter], and it would be just as\r\nlegal as slavery is in Kansas. But by express statute, in the land of\r\nWashington and Jefferson, we may soon be brought face to face with the\r\ndiscreditable fact of showing to the world by our acts that we prefer\r\nslavery to freedom--darkness to light! [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIt is, I believe, a principle in law that when one party to a contract\r\nviolates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is\r\nmade, the other party may rescind it. I will ask Browning if that ain't\r\ngood law. [Voices: \"Yes!\"] Well, now if that be right, I go for rescinding\r\nthe whole, entire Missouri Compromise and thus turning Missouri into a\r\nfree State; and I should like to know the difference--should like for\r\nany one to point out the difference--between our making a free State of\r\nMissouri and their making a slave State of Kansas. [Great applause.] There\r\nain't one bit of difference, except that our way would be a great mercy\r\nto humanity. But I have never said, and the Whig party has never said, and\r\nthose who oppose the Nebraska Bill do not as a body say, that they\r\nhave any intention of interfering with slavery in the slave States. Our\r\nplatform says just the contrary. We allow slavery to exist in the slave\r\nStates, not because slavery is right or good, but from the necessities of\r\nour Union. We grant a fugitive slave law because it is so \"nominated in\r\nthe bond\"; because our fathers so stipulated--had to--and we are bound to\r\ncarry out this agreement. But they did not agree to introduce slavery in\r\nregions where it did not previously exist. On the contrary, they said by\r\ntheir example and teachings that they did not deem it expedient--did n't\r\nconsider it right--to do so; and it is wise and right to do just as\r\nthey did about it. [Voices: \"Good!\"] And that it what we propose--not to\r\ninterfere with slavery where it exists (we have never tried to do it),\r\nand to give them a reasonable and efficient fugitive slave law. [A voice:\r\n\"No!\"] I say YES! [Applause.] It was part of the bargain, and I 'm for\r\nliving up to it; but I go no further; I'm not bound to do more, and I\r\nwon't agree any further. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nWe, here in Illinois, should feel especially proud of the provision of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise excluding slavery from what is now Kansas; for an\r\nIllinois man, Jesse B. Thomas, was its father. Henry Clay, who is credited\r\nwith the authorship of the Compromise in general terms, did not even vote\r\nfor that provision, but only advocated the ultimate admission by a second\r\ncompromise; and Thomas was, beyond all controversy, the real author of the\r\n\"slavery restriction\" branch of the Compromise. To show the generosity of\r\nthe Northern members toward the Southern side: on a test vote to exclude\r\nslavery from Missouri, ninety voted not to exclude, and eighty-seven to\r\nexclude, every vote from the slave States being ranged with the former and\r\nfourteen votes from the free States, of whom seven were from New England\r\nalone; while on a vote to exclude slavery from what is now Kansas, the\r\nvote was one hundred and thirty-four for, to forty-two against. The\r\nscheme, as a whole, was, of course, a Southern triumph. It is idle to\r\ncontend otherwise, as is now being done by the Nebraskites; it was\r\nso shown by the votes and quite as emphatically by the expressions of\r\nrepresentative men. Mr. Lowndes of South Carolina was never known to\r\ncommit a political mistake; his was the great judgment of that section;\r\nand he declared that this measure \"would restore tranquillity to the\r\ncountry--a result demanded by every consideration of discretion, of\r\nmoderation, of wisdom, and of virtue.\" When the measure came before\r\nPresident Monroe for his approval, he put to each member of his cabinet\r\nthis question: \"Has Congress the constitutional power to prohibit slavery\r\nin a Territory?\" And John C. Calhoun and William H. Crawford from the\r\nSouth, equally with John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Rush, and Smith\r\nThompson from the North, alike answered, \"Yes!\" without qualification or\r\nequivocation; and this measure, of so great consequence to the South, was\r\npassed; and Missouri was, by means of it, finally enabled to knock at the\r\ndoor of the Republic for an open passage to its brood of slaves. And, in\r\nspite of this, Freedom's share is about to be taken by violence--by the\r\nforce of misrepresentative votes, not called for by the popular will.\r\nWhat name can I, in common decency, give to this wicked transaction?\r\n[Sensation.]\r\n\r\nBut even then the contest was not over; for when the Missouri constitution\r\ncame before Congress for its approval, it forbade any free negro or\r\nmulatto from entering the State. In short, our Illinois \"black laws\" were\r\nhidden away in their constitution [Laughter], and the controversy was thus\r\nrevived. Then it was that Mr. Clay's talents shone out conspicuously, and\r\nthe controversy that shook the union to its foundation was finally settled\r\nto the satisfaction of the conservative parties on both sides of the line,\r\nthough not to the extremists on either, and Missouri was admitted by the\r\nsmall majority of six in the lower House. How great a majority, do you\r\nthink, would have been given had Kansas also been secured for slavery?\r\n[A voice: \"A majority the other way.\"] \"A majority the other way,\" is\r\nanswered. Do you think it would have been safe for a Northern man to have\r\nconfronted his constituents after having voted to consign both\r\nMissouri and Kansas to hopeless slavery? And yet this man Douglas, who\r\nmisrepresents his constituents and who has exerted his highest talents in\r\nthat direction, will be carried in triumph through the State and hailed\r\nwith honor while applauding that act. [Three groans for \"Dug!\"] And this\r\nshows whither we are tending. This thing of slavery is more powerful than\r\nits supporters--even than the high priests that minister at its altar.\r\nIt debauches even our greatest men. It gathers strength, like a rolling\r\nsnowball, by its own infamy. Monstrous crimes are committed in its name by\r\npersons collectively which they would not dare to commit as individuals.\r\nIts aggressions and encroachments almost surpass belief. In a despotism,\r\none might not wonder to see slavery advance steadily and remorselessly\r\ninto new dominions; but is it not wonderful, is it not even alarming, to\r\nsee its steady advance in a land dedicated to the proposition that \"all\r\nmen are created equal\"? [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIt yields nothing itself; it keeps all it has, and gets all it can\r\nbesides. It really came dangerously near securing Illinois in 1824; it\r\ndid get Missouri in 1821. The first proposition was to admit what is now\r\nArkansas and Missouri as one slave State. But the territory was divided\r\nand Arkansas came in, without serious question, as a slave State; and\r\nafterwards Missouri, not, as a sort of equality, free, but also as a slave\r\nState. Then we had Florida and Texas; and now Kansas is about to be forced\r\ninto the dismal procession. [Sensation.] And so it is wherever you look.\r\nWe have not forgotten--it is but six years since--how dangerously near\r\nCalifornia came to being a slave State. Texas is a slave State, and four\r\nother slave States may be carved from its vast domain. And yet, in the\r\nyear 1829, slavery was abolished throughout that vast region by a royal\r\ndecree of the then sovereign of Mexico. Will you please tell me by what\r\nright slavery exists in Texas to-day? By the same right as, and no higher\r\nor greater than, slavery is seeking dominion in Kansas: by political\r\nforce--peaceful, if that will suffice; by the torch (as in Kansas) and the\r\nbludgeon (as in the Senate chamber), if required. And so history repeats\r\nitself; and even as slavery has kept its course by craft, intimidation,\r\nand violence in the past, so it will persist, in my judgment, until met\r\nand dominated by the will of a people bent on its restriction.\r\n\r\nWe have, this very afternoon, heard bitter denunciations of Brooks in\r\nWashington, and Titus, Stringfellow, Atchison, Jones, and Shannon in\r\nKansas--the battle-ground of slavery. I certainly am not going to advocate\r\nor shield them; but they and their acts are but the necessary outcome of\r\nthe Nebraska law. We should reserve our highest censure for the authors\r\nof the mischief, and not for the catspaws which they use. I believe it was\r\nShakespeare who said, \"Where the offence lies, there let the axe fall\";\r\nand, in my opinion, this man Douglas and the Northern men in Congress\r\nwho advocate \"Nebraska\" are more guilty than a thousand Joneses and\r\nStringfellows, with all their murderous practices, can be. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nWe have made a good beginning here to-day. As our Methodist friends would\r\nsay, \"I feel it is good to be here.\" While extremists may find some fault\r\nwith the moderation of our platform, they should recollect that \"the\r\nbattle is not always to the strong, nor the race to the swift.\" In grave\r\nemergencies, moderation is generally safer than radicalism; and as this\r\nstruggle is likely to be long and earnest, we must not, by our action,\r\nrepel any who are in sympathy with us in the main, but rather win all that\r\nwe can to our standard. We must not belittle nor overlook the facts of our\r\ncondition--that we are new and comparatively weak, while our enemies are\r\nentrenched and relatively strong. They have the administration and the\r\npolitical power; and, right or wrong, at present they have the numbers.\r\nOur friends who urge an appeal to arms with so much force and eloquence\r\nshould recollect that the government is arrayed against us, and that the\r\nnumbers are now arrayed against us as well; or, to state it nearer to the\r\ntruth, they are not yet expressly and affirmatively for us; and we should\r\nrepel friends rather than gain them by anything savoring of revolutionary\r\nmethods. As it now stands, we must appeal to the sober sense and\r\npatriotism of the people. We will make converts day by day; we will grow\r\nstrong by calmness and moderation; we will grow strong by the violence and\r\ninjustice of our adversaries. And, unless truth be a mockery and justice\r\na hollow lie, we will be in the majority after a while, and then the\r\nrevolution which we will accomplish will be none the less radical from\r\nbeing the result of pacific measures. The battle of freedom is to be\r\nfought out on principle. Slavery is a violation of the eternal right. We\r\nhave temporized with it from the necessities of our condition; but as sure\r\nas God reigns and school children read, THAT BLACK FOUL LIE CAN NEVER\r\nBE CONSECRATED INTO GOD'S HALLOWED TRUTH! [Immense applause lasting some\r\ntime.]\r\n\r\nOne of our greatest difficulties is, that men who know that slavery is a\r\ndetestable crime and ruinous to the nation are compelled, by our peculiar\r\ncondition and other circumstances, to advocate it concretely, though\r\ndamning it in the raw. Henry Clay was a brilliant example of this\r\ntendency; others of our purest statesmen are compelled to do so; and thus\r\nslavery secures actual support from those who detest it at heart. Yet\r\nHenry Clay perfected and forced through the compromise which secured to\r\nslavery a great State as well as a political advantage. Not that he hated\r\nslavery less, but that he loved the whole Union more. As long as slavery\r\nprofited by his great compromise, the hosts of proslavery could not\r\nsufficiently cover him with praise; but now that this compromise stands in\r\ntheir way--\r\n\r\n   \"....they never mention him,\r\n   His name is never heard:\r\n   Their lips are now forbid to speak\r\n   That once familiar word.\"\r\n\r\nThey have slaughtered one of his most cherished measures, and his ghost\r\nwould arise to rebuke them. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nNow, let us harmonize, my friends, and appeal to the moderation and\r\npatriotism of the people: to the sober second thought; to the awakened\r\npublic conscience. The repeal of the sacred Missouri Compromise has\r\ninstalled the weapons of violence: the bludgeon, the incendiary torch, the\r\ndeath-dealing rifle, the bristling cannon--the weapons of kingcraft, of\r\nthe inquisition, of ignorance, of barbarism, of oppression. We see its\r\nfruits in the dying bed of the heroic Sumner; in the ruins of the \"Free\r\nState\" hotel; in the smoking embers of the Herald of Freedom; in the\r\nfree-State Governor of Kansas chained to a stake on freedom's soil like a\r\nhorse-thief, for the crime of freedom. [Applause.] We see it in Christian\r\nstatesmen, and Christian newspapers, and Christian pulpits applauding the\r\ncowardly act of a low bully, WHO CRAWLED UPON HIS VICTIM BEHIND HIS BACK\r\nAND DEALT THE DEADLY BLOW. [Sensation and applause.] We note our political\r\ndemoralization in the catch-words that are coming into such common use;\r\non the one hand, \"freedom-shriekers,\" and sometimes \"freedom-screechers\"\r\n[Laughter], and, on the other hand, \"border-ruffians,\" and that fully\r\ndeserved. And the significance of catch-words cannot pass unheeded, for\r\nthey constitute a sign of the times. Everything in this world \"jibes\" in\r\nwith everything else, and all the fruits of this Nebraska Bill are like\r\nthe poisoned source from which they come. I will not say that we may not\r\nsooner or later be compelled to meet force by force; but the time has not\r\nyet come, and, if we are true to ourselves, may never come. Do not mistake\r\nthat the ballot is stronger than the bullet. Therefore let the legions\r\nof slavery use bullets; but let us wait patiently till November and fire\r\nballots at them in return; and by that peaceful policy I believe we shall\r\nultimately win. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nIt was by that policy that here in Illinois the early fathers fought the\r\ngood fight and gained the victory. In 1824 the free men of our State, led\r\nby Governor Coles (who was a native of Maryland and President Madison's\r\nprivate secretary), determined that those beautiful groves should never\r\nre-echo the dirge of one who has no title to himself. By their resolute\r\ndetermination, the winds that sweep across our broad prairies shall never\r\ncool the parched brow, nor shall the unfettered streams that bring joy and\r\ngladness to our free soil water the tired feet, of a slave; but so long as\r\nthose heavenly breezes and sparkling streams bless the land, or the groves\r\nand their fragrance or memory remain, the humanity to which they minister\r\nSHALL BE FOREVER FREE! [Great applause] Palmer, Yates, Williams, Browning,\r\nand some more in this convention came from Kentucky to Illinois (instead\r\nof going to Missouri), not only to better their conditions, but also to\r\nget away from slavery. They have said so to me, and it is understood among\r\nus Kentuckians that we don't like it one bit. Now, can we, mindful of the\r\nblessings of liberty which the early men of Illinois left to us, refuse a\r\nlike privilege to the free men who seek to plant Freedom's banner on our\r\nWestern outposts? [\"No!\" \"No!\"] Should we not stand by our neighbors who\r\nseek to better their conditions in Kansas and Nebraska? [\"Yes!\" \"Yes!\"]\r\nCan we as Christian men, and strong and free ourselves, wield the sledge\r\nor hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed race?\r\n[\"No!\" \"No!\"] \"Woe unto them,\" it is written, \"that decree unrighteous\r\ndecrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed.\" Can we\r\nafford to sin any more deeply against human liberty? [\"No!\" \"No!\"]\r\n\r\nOne great trouble in the matter is, that slavery is an insidious and\r\ncrafty power, and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well as\r\nby sly management of the peaceful. Even after the Ordinance of 1787, the\r\nsettlers in Indiana and Illinois (it was all one government then) tried to\r\nget Congress to allow slavery temporarily, and petitions to that end were\r\nsent from Kaskaskia, and General Harrison, the Governor, urged it from\r\nVincennes, the capital. If that had succeeded, good-bye to liberty here.\r\nBut John Randolph of Virginia made a vigorous report against it; and\r\nalthough they persevered so well as to get three favorable reports for it,\r\nyet the United States Senate, with the aid of some slave States, finally\r\nsquelched if for good. [Applause.] And that is why this hall is to-day a\r\ntemple for free men instead of a negro livery-stable. [Great applause and\r\nlaughter.] Once let slavery get planted in a locality, by ever so weak or\r\ndoubtful a title, and in ever so small numbers, and it is like the Canada\r\nthistle or Bermuda grass--you can't root it out. You yourself may detest\r\nslavery; but your neighbor has five or six slaves, and he is an excellent\r\nneighbor, or your son has married his daughter, and they beg you to help\r\nsave their property, and you vote against your interests and principle to\r\naccommodate a neighbor, hoping that your vote will be on the losing side.\r\nAnd others do the same; and in those ways slavery gets a sure foothold.\r\nAnd when that is done the whole mighty Union--the force of the nation--is\r\ncommitted to its support. And that very process is working in Kansas\r\nto-day. And you must recollect that the slave property is worth a billion\r\nof dollars; while free-State men must work for sentiment alone. Then there\r\nare \"blue lodges\"--as they call them--everywhere doing their secret and\r\ndeadly work.\r\n\r\nIt is a very strange thing, and not solvable by any moral law that I know\r\nof, that if a man loses his horse, the whole country will turn out to\r\nhelp hang the thief; but if a man but a shade or two darker than I am is\r\nhimself stolen, the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring him to\r\nliberty. Such are the inconsistencies of slavery, where a horse is more\r\nsacred than a man; and the essence of squatter or popular sovereignty--I\r\ndon't care how you call it--is that if one man chooses to make a slave of\r\nanother, no third man shall be allowed to object. And if you can do this\r\nin free Kansas, and it is allowed to stand, the next thing you will see is\r\nshiploads of negroes from Africa at the wharf at Charleston, for one thing\r\nis as truly lawful as the other; and these are the bastard notions we have\r\ngot to stamp out, else they will stamp us out. [Sensation and applause.]\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, at Springfield, Judge Douglas avowed that Illinois came\r\ninto the Union as a slave State, and that slavery was weeded out by\r\nthe operation of his great, patent, everlasting principle of \"popular\r\nsovereignty.\" [Laughter.] Well, now, that argument must be answered, for\r\nit has a little grain of truth at the bottom. I do not mean that it is\r\ntrue in essence, as he would have us believe. It could not be essentially\r\ntrue if the Ordinance of '87 was valid. But, in point of fact, there\r\nwere some degraded beings called slaves in Kaskaskia and the other French\r\nsettlements when our first State constitution was adopted; that is a fact,\r\nand I don't deny it. Slaves were brought here as early as 1720, and were\r\nkept here in spite of the Ordinance of 1787 against it. But slavery did\r\nnot thrive here. On the contrary, under the influence of the ordinance the\r\nnumber decreased fifty-one from 1810 to 1820; while under the influence of\r\nsquatter sovereignty, right across the river in Missouri, they increased\r\nseven thousand two hundred and eleven in the same time; and slavery\r\nfinally faded out in Illinois, under the influence of the law of freedom,\r\nwhile it grew stronger and stronger in Missouri, under the law or practice\r\nof \"popular sovereignty.\" In point of fact there were but one hundred and\r\nseventeen slaves in Illinois one year after its admission, or one to every\r\nfour hundred and seventy of its population; or, to state it in another\r\nway, if Illinois was a slave State in 1820, so were New York and New\r\nJersey much greater slave States from having had greater numbers, slavery\r\nhaving been established there in very early times. But there is this vital\r\ndifference between all these States and the Judge's Kansas experiment:\r\nthat they sought to disestablish slavery which had been already\r\nestablished, while the Judge seeks, so far as he can, to disestablish\r\nfreedom, which had been established there by the Missouri Compromise.\r\n[Voices: \"Good!\"]\r\n\r\nThe Union is under-going a fearful strain; but it is a stout old ship, and\r\nhas weathered many a hard blow, and \"the stars in their courses,\" aye, an\r\ninvisible Power, greater than the puny efforts of men, will fight for us.\r\nBut we ourselves must not decline the burden of responsibility, nor take\r\ncounsel of unworthy passions. Whatever duty urges us to do or to omit must\r\nbe done or omitted; and the recklessness with which our adversaries break\r\nthe laws, or counsel their violation, should afford no example for us.\r\nTherefore, let us revere the Declaration of Independence; let us continue\r\nto obey the Constitution and the laws; let us keep step to the music of\r\nthe Union. Let us draw a cordon, so to speak, around the slave States, and\r\nthe hateful institution, like a reptile poisoning itself, will perish by\r\nits own infamy. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nBut we cannot be free men if this is, by our national choice, to be a\r\nland of slavery. Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for\r\nthemselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.[Loud\r\napplause.]\r\n\r\nDid you ever, my friends, seriously reflect upon the speed with which we\r\nare tending downwards? Within the memory of men now present the leading\r\nstatesman of Virginia could make genuine, red-hot abolitionist speeches in\r\nold Virginia! and, as I have said, now even in \"free Kansas\" it is a crime\r\nto declare that it is \"free Kansas.\" The very sentiments that I and others\r\nhave just uttered would entitle us, and each of us, to the ignominy and\r\nseclusion of a dungeon; and yet I suppose that, like Paul, we were \"free\r\nborn.\" But if this thing is allowed to continue, it will be but one step\r\nfurther to impress the same rule in Illinois. [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of all is, that we must restore the Missouri Compromise.\r\nWe must highly resolve that Kansas must be free! [Great applause.] We\r\nmust reinstate the birthday promise of the Republic; we must reaffirm the\r\nDeclaration of Independence; we must make good in essence as well as in\r\nform Madison's avowal that \"the word slave ought not to appear in the\r\nConstitution\"; and we must even go further, and decree that only local\r\nlaw, and not that time-honored instrument, shall shelter a slaveholder. We\r\nmust make this a land of liberty in fact, as it is in name. But in seeking\r\nto attain these results--so indispensable if the liberty which is our\r\npride and boast shall endure--we will be loyal to the Constitution and\r\nto the \"flag of our Union,\" and no matter what our grievance--even though\r\nKansas shall come in as a slave State; and no matter what theirs--even if\r\nwe shall restore the compromise--WE WILL SAY TO THE SOUTHERN DISUNIONISTS,\r\nWE WON'T GO OUT OF THE UNION, AND YOU SHAN'T!\r\n\r\n[This was the climax; the audience rose to its feet en masse, applauded,\r\nstamped, waved handkerchiefs, threw hats in the air, and ran riot for\r\nseveral minutes. The arch-enchanter who wrought this transformation\r\nlooked, meanwhile, like the personification of political justice.]\r\n\r\nBut let us, meanwhile, appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people,\r\nand not to their prejudices; let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here\r\naroused all over these vast prairies, so suggestive of freedom. Let us\r\ncommence by electing the gallant soldier Governor (Colonel) Bissell\r\nwho stood for the honor of our State alike on the plains and amidst the\r\nchaparral of Mexico and on the floor of Congress, while he defied the\r\nSouthern Hotspur; and that will have a greater moral effect than all the\r\nborder ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on Kansas. There is both\r\na power and a magic in popular opinion. To that let us now appeal;\r\nand while, in all probability, no resort to force will be needed, our\r\nmoderation and forbearance will stand US in good stead when, if ever, WE\r\nMUST MAKE AN APPEAL TO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF HOSTS! [Immense applause\r\nand a rush for the orator.]\r\n\r\nOne can realize with this ability to move people's minds that the Southern\r\nConspiracy were right to hate this man. He, better than any at the time\r\nwas able to uncover their stratagems and tear down their sophisms and\r\ncontradictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\nTO W. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, July 9, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR WHITNEY:--I now expect to go to Chicago on the 15th, and I probably\r\nshall remain there or thereabouts for about two weeks.\r\n\r\nIt turned me blind when I first heard Swett was beaten and Lovejoy\r\nnominated; but, after much reflection, I really believe it is best to let\r\nit stand. This, of course, I wish to be confidential.\r\n\r\nLamon did get your deeds. I went with him to the office, got them, and put\r\nthem in his hands myself.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON OUT-OF-STATE CAMPAIGNERS\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM GRIMES.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, July 12, 1856\r\n\r\nYour's of the 29th of June was duly received. I did not answer it because\r\nit plagued me. This morning I received another from Judd and Peck, written\r\nby consultation with you. Now let me tell you why I am plagued:\r\n\r\n1. I can hardly spare the time.\r\n\r\n2. I am superstitious. I have scarcely known a party preceding an election\r\nto call in help from the neighboring States but they lost the State. Last\r\nfall, our friends had Wade, of Ohio, and others, in Maine; and they lost\r\nthe State. Last spring our adversaries had New Hampshire full of South\r\nCarolinians, and they lost the State. And so, generally, it seems to stir\r\nup more enemies than friends.\r\n\r\nHave the enemy called in any foreign help? If they have a foreign champion\r\nthere I should have no objection to drive a nail in his track. I shall\r\nreach Chicago on the night of the 15th, to attend to a little business\r\nin court. Consider the things I have suggested, and write me at Chicago.\r\nEspecially write me whether Browning consents to visit you.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN SPEECH\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT GALENA, ILLINOIS, IN THE FREMONT CAMPAIGN,\r\n\r\nAUGUST 1, 1856.\r\n\r\nYou further charge us with being disunionists. If you mean that it is\r\nour aim to dissolve the Union, I for myself answer that it is untrue; for\r\nthose who act with me I answer that it is untrue. Have you heard us assert\r\nthat as our aim? Do you really believe that such is our aim? Do you find\r\nit in our platform, our speeches, our conventions, or anywhere? If not,\r\nwithdraw the charge.\r\n\r\nBut you may say that, though it is not our aim, it will be the result\r\nif we succeed, and that we are therefore disunionists in fact. This is a\r\ngrave charge you make against us, and we certainly have a right to demand\r\nthat you specify in what way we are to dissolve the Union. How are we to\r\neffect this?\r\n\r\nThe only specification offered is volunteered by Mr. Fillmore in\r\nhis Albany speech. His charge is that if we elect a President and\r\nVice-President both from the free States, it will dissolve the Union.\r\nThis is open folly. The Constitution provides that the President and\r\nVice-President of the United States shall be of different States, but says\r\nnothing as to the latitude and longitude of those States. In 1828 Andrew\r\nJackson, of Tennessee, and John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina, were\r\nelected President and Vice-President, both from slave States; but no one\r\nthought of dissolving the Union then on that account. In 1840 Harrison, of\r\nOhio, and Tyler, of Virginia, were elected. In 1841 Harrison died and John\r\nTyler succeeded to the Presidency, and William R. King, of Alabama, was\r\nelected acting Vice-President by the Senate; but no one supposed that the\r\nUnion was in danger. In fact, at the very time Mr. Fillmore uttered this\r\nidle charge, the state of things in the United States disproved it. Mr.\r\nPierce, of New Hampshire, and Mr. Bright, of Indiana, both from free\r\nStates, are President and Vice-President, and the Union stands and will\r\nstand. You do not pretend that it ought to dissolve the Union, and the\r\nfacts show that it won't; therefore the charge may be dismissed without\r\nfurther consideration.\r\n\r\nNo other specification is made, and the only one that could be made is\r\nthat the restoration of the restriction of 1820, making the United States\r\nterritory free territory, would dissolve the Union. Gentlemen, it will\r\nrequire a decided majority to pass such an act. We, the majority, being\r\nable constitutionally to do all that we purpose, would have no desire to\r\ndissolve the Union. Do you say that such restriction of slavery would\r\nbe unconstitutional, and that some of the States would not submit to its\r\nenforcement? I grant you that an unconstitutional act is not a law; but\r\nI do not ask and will not take your construction of the Constitution.\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is the tribunal to decide such a\r\nquestion, and we will submit to its decisions; and if you do also,\r\nthere will be an end of the matter. Will you? If not, who are the\r\ndisunionists--you or we? We, the majority, would not strive to dissolve\r\nthe Union; and if any attempt is made, it must be by you, who so loudly\r\nstigmatize us as disunionists. But the Union, in any event, will not be\r\ndissolved. We don't want to dissolve it, and if you attempt it we won't\r\nlet you. With the purse and sword, the army and navy and treasury, in our\r\nhands and at our command, you could not do it. This government would be\r\nvery weak indeed if a majority with a disciplined army and navy and\r\na well-filled treasury could not preserve itself when attacked by an\r\nunarmed, undisciplined, unorganized minority. All this talk about the\r\ndissolution of the Union is humbug, nothing but folly. We do not want to\r\ndissolve the Union; you shall not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DANGER OF THIRD-PARTIES\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BENNETT.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, AUG. 4, 1856\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I understand you are a Fillmore man. If, as between Fremont\r\nand Buchanan, you really prefer the election of Buchanan, then burn this\r\nwithout reading a line further. But if you would like to defeat Buchanan\r\nand his gang, allow me a word with you: Does any one pretend that Fillmore\r\ncan carry the vote of this State? I have not heard a single man pretend\r\nso. Every vote taken from Fremont and given to Fillmore is just so much\r\nin favor of Buchanan. The Buchanan men see this; and hence their great\r\nanxiety in favor of the Fillmore movement. They know where the shoe\r\npinches. They now greatly prefer having a man of your character go for\r\nFillmore than for Buchanan because they expect several to go with you, who\r\nwould go for Fremont if you were to go directly for Buchanan.\r\n\r\nI think I now understand the relative strength of the three parties in\r\nthis State as well as any one man does, and my opinion is that to-day\r\nBuchanan has alone 85,000, Fremont 78,000, and Fillmore 21,000.\r\n\r\nThis gives B. the State by 7000 and leaves him in the minority of the\r\nwhole 14,000.\r\n\r\nFremont and Fillmore men being united on Bissell, as they already are,\r\nhe cannot be beaten. This is not a long letter, but it contains the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JESSE K. DUBOIS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. 19, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR DUBOIS: Your letter on the same sheet with Mr. Miller's is just\r\nreceived. I have been absent four days. I do not know when your court\r\nsits.\r\n\r\nTrumbull has written the committee here to have a set of appointments\r\nmade for him commencing here in Springfield, on the 11th of Sept., and\r\nto extend throughout the south half of the State. When he goes to\r\nLawrenceville, as he will, I will strain every nerve to be with you and\r\nhim. More than that I cannot promise now.\r\n\r\nYours as truly as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HARRISON MALTBY.\r\n\r\n[Confidential]\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, September 8, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I understand you are a Fillmore man. Let me prove to you that\r\nevery vote withheld from Fremont and given to Fillmore in this State\r\nactually lessens Fillmore's chance of being President. Suppose Buchanan\r\ngets all the slave States and Pennsylvania, and any other one State\r\nbesides; then he is elected, no matter who gets all the rest. But suppose\r\nFillmore gets the two slave States of Maryland and Kentucky; then Buchanan\r\nis not elected; Fillmore goes into the House of Representatives, and may\r\nbe made President by a compromise. But suppose, again, Fillmore's friends\r\nthrow away a few thousand votes on him in Indiana and Illinois; it will\r\ninevitably give these States to Buchanan, which will more than compensate\r\nhim for the loss of Maryland and Kentucky, will elect him, and leave\r\nFillmore no chance in the House of Representatives or out of it.\r\n\r\nThis is as plain as adding up the weight of three small hogs. As Mr.\r\nFillmore has no possible chance to carry Illinois for himself, it is\r\nplainly to his interest to let Fremont take it, and thus keep it out of\r\nthe hands of Buchanan. Be not deceived. Buchanan is the hard horse to beat\r\nin this race. Let him have Illinois, and nothing can beat him; and he will\r\nget Illinois if men persist in throwing away votes upon Mr. Fillmore.\r\nDoes some one persuade you that Mr. Fillmore can carry Illinois? Nonsense!\r\nThere are over seventy newspapers in Illinois opposing Buchanan, only\r\nthree or four of which support Mr. Fillmore, all the rest going for\r\nFremont. Are not these newspapers a fair index of the proportion of the\r\nvotes? If not, tell me why.\r\n\r\nAgain, of these three or four Fillmore newspapers, two, at least, are\r\nsupported in part by the Buchanan men, as I understand. Do not they know\r\nwhere the shoe pinches? They know the Fillmore movement helps them, and\r\ntherefore they help it. Do think these things over, and then act according\r\nto your judgment.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Dr. R. BOAL.\r\n\r\nSept. 14, 1856.\r\n\r\nDr. R. BOAL, Lacon, Ill.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 8th inviting me to be with [you] at Lacon on\r\nthe 30th is received. I feel that I owe you and our friends of Marshall a\r\ngood deal, and I will come if I can; and if I do not get there, it will be\r\nbecause I shall think my efforts are now needed farther south.\r\n\r\nPresent my regards to Mrs. Boal, and believe [me], as ever,\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY O'CONNER, MUSCATINE, IOWA.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Sept. 14, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours, inviting me to attend a mass-meeting on the 23d inst.,\r\nis received. It would be very pleasant to strike hands with the Fremonters\r\nof Iowa, who have led the van so splendidly, in this grand charge which\r\nwe hope and believe will end in a most glorious victory. All thanks, all\r\nhonor to Iowa! But Iowa is out of all danger, and it is no time for us,\r\nwhen the battle still rages, to pay holiday visits to Iowa. I am sure you\r\nwill excuse me for remaining in Illinois, where much hard work is still to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE DEMOCRATIC VICTORY OF BUCHANAN\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT A REPUBLICAN BANQUET IN CHICAGO, DECEMBER 10, 1856.\r\n\r\nWe have another annual Presidential message. Like a rejected lover making\r\nmerry at the wedding of his rival, the President felicitates himself\r\nhugely over the late Presidential election. He considers the result a\r\nsignal triumph of good principles and good men, and a very pointed rebuke\r\nof bad ones. He says the people did it. He forgets that the \"people,\" as\r\nhe complacently calls only those who voted for Buchanan, are in a minority\r\nof the whole people by about four hundred thousand votes--one full tenth\r\nof all the votes. Remembering this, he might perceive that the \"rebuke\"\r\nmay not be quite as durable as he seems to think--that the majority may\r\nnot choose to remain permanently rebuked by that minority.\r\n\r\nThe President thinks the great body of us Fremonters, being ardently\r\nattached to liberty, in the abstract, were duped by a few wicked and\r\ndesigning men. There is a slight difference of opinion on this. We think\r\nhe, being ardently attached to the hope of a second term, in the concrete,\r\nwas duped by men who had liberty every way. He is the cat's-paw. By much\r\ndragging of chestnuts from the fire for others to eat, his claws are burnt\r\noff to the gristle, and he is thrown aside as unfit for further use.\r\nAs the fool said of King Lear, when his daughters had turned him out of\r\ndoors, \"He 's a shelled peascod\" (\"That 's a sheal'd peascod\").\r\n\r\nSo far as the President charges us \"with a desire to change the domestic\r\ninstitutions of existing States,\" and of \"doing everything in our power to\r\ndeprive the Constitution and the laws of moral authority,\" for the whole\r\nparty on belief, and for myself on knowledge, I pronounce the charge an\r\nunmixed and unmitigated falsehood.\r\n\r\nOur government rests in public opinion. Whoever can change public opinion\r\ncan change the government practically just so much. Public opinion, on any\r\nsubject, always has a \"central idea,\" from which all its minor thoughts\r\nradiate. That \"central idea\" in our political public opinion at the\r\nbeginning was, and until recently has continued to be, \"the equality\r\nof men.\" And although it has always submitted patiently to whatever of\r\ninequality there seemed to be as matter of actual necessity, its constant\r\nworking has been a steady progress toward the practical equality of all\r\nmen. The late Presidential election was a struggle by one party to discard\r\nthat central idea and to substitute for it the opposite idea that slavery\r\nis right in the abstract, the workings of which as a central idea may be\r\nthe perpetuity of human slavery and its extension to all countries and\r\ncolors. Less than a year ago the Richmond Enquirer, an avowed advocate of\r\nslavery, regardless of color, in order to favor his views, invented the\r\nphrase \"State equality,\" and now the President, in his message, adopts\r\nthe Enquirer's catch-phrase, telling us the people \"have asserted the\r\nconstitutional equality of each and all of the States of the Union as\r\nStates.\" The President flatters himself that the new central idea is\r\ncompletely inaugurated; and so indeed it is, so far as the mere fact of a\r\nPresidential election can inaugurate it. To us it is left to know that the\r\nmajority of the people have not yet declared for it, and to hope that they\r\nnever will.\r\n\r\nAll of us who did not vote for Mr. Buchanan, taken together, are a\r\nmajority of four hundred thousand. But in the late contest we were divided\r\nbetween Fremont and Fillmore. Can we not come together for the future? Let\r\nevery one who really believes and is resolved that free society is not and\r\nshall not be a failure, and who can conscientiously declare that in the\r\nlast contest he has done only what he thought best--let every such one\r\nhave charity to believe that every other one can say as much. Thus let\r\nbygones be bygones; let past differences as nothing be; and with steady\r\neye on the real issue let us reinaugurate the good old \"central idea\" of\r\nthe republic. We can do it. The human heart is with us; God is with us. We\r\nshall again be able, not to declare that \"all States as States are equal,\"\r\nnor yet that \"all citizens as citizens are equal,\" but to renew the\r\nbroader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that \"all\r\nmen are created equal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Dr. R. BOAL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. 25, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:-When I was at Chicago two weeks ago I saw Mr. Arnold, and from\r\na remark of his I inferred he was thinking of the speakership, though\r\nI think he was not anxious about it. He seemed most anxious for harmony\r\ngenerally, and particularly that the contested seats from Peoria and\r\nMcDonough might be rightly determined. Since I came home I had a talk with\r\nCullom, one of our American representatives here, and he says he is for\r\nyou for Speaker and also that he thinks all the Americans will be for you,\r\nunless it be Gorin, of Macon, of whom he cannot speak. If you would like\r\nto be Speaker go right up and see Arnold. He is talented, a practised\r\ndebater, and, I think, would do himself more credit on the floor than in\r\nthe Speaker's seat. Go and see him; and if you think fit, show him this\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1857\r\n\r\nTO JOHN E. ROSETTE. Private.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., February 10, 1857.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your note about the little paragraph in the Republican was\r\nreceived yesterday, since which time I have been too unwell to notice\r\nit. I had not supposed you wrote or approved it. The whole originated\r\nin mistake. You know by the conversation with me that I thought the\r\nestablishment of the paper unfortunate, but I always expected to throw\r\nno obstacle in its way, and to patronize it to the extent of taking and\r\npaying for one copy. When the paper was brought to my house, my wife said\r\nto me, \"Now are you going to take another worthless little paper?\" I said\r\nto her evasively, \"I have not directed the paper to be left.\" From this,\r\nin my absence, she sent the message to the carrier. This is the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A DOUGLAS SPEECH\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, JUNE 26, 1857.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I am here to-night partly by the invitation of some of\r\nyou, and partly by my own inclination. Two weeks ago Judge Douglas spoke\r\nhere on the several subjects of Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, and Utah.\r\nI listened to the speech at the time, and have the report of it since.\r\nIt was intended to controvert opinions which I think just, and to assail\r\n(politically, not personally) those men who, in common with me, entertain\r\nthose opinions. For this reason I wished then, and still wish, to make\r\nsome answer to it, which I now take the opportunity of doing.\r\n\r\nI begin with Utah. If it prove to be true, as is probable, that the people\r\nof Utah are in open rebellion to the United States, then Judge Douglas is\r\nin favor of repealing their territorial organization, and attaching them\r\nto the adjoining States for judicial purposes. I say, too, if they are in\r\nrebellion, they ought to be somehow coerced to obedience; and I am not now\r\nprepared to admit or deny that the Judge's mode of coercing them is not\r\nas good as any. The Republicans can fall in with it without taking back\r\nanything they have ever said. To be sure, it would be a considerable\r\nbacking down by Judge Douglas from his much-vaunted doctrine of\r\nself-government for the Territories; but this is only additional proof\r\nof what was very plain from the beginning, that that doctrine was a mere\r\ndeceitful pretense for the benefit of slavery. Those who could not\r\nsee that much in the Nebraska act itself, which forced governors, and\r\nsecretaries, and judges on the people of the Territories without their\r\nchoice or consent, could not be made to see, though one should rise from\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nBut in all this it is very plain the Judge evades the only question the\r\nRepublicans have ever pressed upon the Democracy in regard to Utah. That\r\nquestion the Judge well knew to be this: \"If the people of Utah peacefully\r\nform a State constitution tolerating polygamy, will the Democracy admit\r\nthem into the Union?\" There is nothing in the United States Constitution\r\nor law against polygamy; and why is it not a part of the Judge's \"sacred\r\nright of self-government\" for the people to have it, or rather to keep\r\nit, if they choose? These questions, so far as I know, the Judge never\r\nanswers. It might involve the Democracy to answer them either way, and\r\nthey go unanswered.\r\n\r\nAs to Kansas. The substance of the Judge's speech on Kansas is an effort\r\nto put the free-State men in the wrong for not voting at the election of\r\ndelegates to the constitutional convention. He says:\r\n\r\n\"There is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be fairly\r\ninterpreted and impartially executed, so as to insure to every bona fide\r\ninhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears extraordinary that Judge Douglas should make such a statement.\r\nHe knows that, by the law, no one can vote who has not been registered;\r\nand he knows that the free-State men place their refusal to vote on the\r\nground that but few of them have been registered. It is possible that this\r\nis not true, but Judge Douglas knows it is asserted to be true in letters,\r\nnewspapers, and public speeches, and borne by every mail and blown by\r\nevery breeze to the eyes and ears of the world. He knows it is boldly\r\ndeclared that the people of many whole counties, and many whole\r\nneighborhoods in others, are left unregistered; yet he does not venture\r\nto contradict the declaration, or to point out how they can vote without\r\nbeing registered; but he just slips along, not seeming to know there is\r\nany such question of fact, and complacently declares:\r\n\r\n \"There is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be\r\nfairly and impartially executed, so as to insure to every bona fide\r\ninhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise.\"\r\n\r\nI readily agree that if all had a chance to vote they ought to have voted.\r\nIf, on the contrary, as they allege, and Judge Douglas ventures not to\r\nparticularly contradict, few only of the free-State men had a chance to\r\nvote, they were perfectly right in staying from the polls in a body.\r\n\r\nBy the way, since the Judge spoke, the Kansas election has come off. The\r\nJudge expressed his confidence that all the Democrats in Kansas would\r\ndo their duty-including \"free-State Democrats,\" of course. The returns\r\nreceived here as yet are very incomplete; but so far as they go, they\r\nindicate that only about one sixth of the registered voters have really\r\nvoted; and this, too, when not more, perhaps, than one half of the\r\nrightful voters have been registered, thus showing the thing to have\r\nbeen altogether the most exquisite farce ever enacted. I am watching with\r\nconsiderable interest to ascertain what figure \"the free-State Democrats\"\r\ncut in the concern. Of course they voted,--all Democrats do their\r\nduty,--and of course they did not vote for slave-State candidates. We soon\r\nshall know how many delegates they elected, how many candidates they had\r\npledged to a free State, and how many votes were cast for them.\r\n\r\nAllow me to barely whisper my suspicion that there were no such things in\r\nKansas as \"free-State Democrats\"--that they were altogether mythical, good\r\nonly to figure in newspapers and speeches in the free States. If there\r\nshould prove to be one real living free-State Democrat in Kansas, I\r\nsuggest that it might be well to catch him, and stuff and preserve his\r\nskin as an interesting specimen of that soon-to-be extinct variety of the\r\ngenus Democrat.\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the Dred Scott decision. That decision declares two\r\npropositions--first, that a negro cannot sue in the United States courts;\r\nand secondly, that Congress cannot prohibit slavery in the Territories. It\r\nwas made by a divided court dividing differently on the different points.\r\nJudge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision, and in that\r\nrespect I shall follow his example, believing I could no more improve on\r\nMcLean and Curtis than he could on Taney.\r\n\r\nHe denounces all who question the correctness of that decision, as\r\noffering violent resistance to it. But who resists it? Who has, in spite\r\nof the decision, declared Dred Scott free, and resisted the authority of\r\nhis master over him?\r\n\r\nJudicial decisions have two uses--first, to absolutely determine the case\r\ndecided, and secondly, to indicate to the public how other similar cases\r\nwill be decided when they arise. For the latter use, they are called\r\n\"precedents\" and \"authorities.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe as much as Judge Douglas (perhaps more) in obedience to, and\r\nrespect for, the judicial department of government. We think its decisions\r\non constitutional questions, when fully settled, should control not only\r\nthe particular cases decided, but the general policy of the country,\r\nsubject to be disturbed only by amendments of the Constitution as provided\r\nin that instrument itself. More than this would be revolution. But we\r\nthink the Dred Scott decision is erroneous. We know the court that made it\r\nhas often overruled its own decisions, and we shall do what we can to have\r\nit to overrule this. We offer no resistance to it.\r\n\r\nJudicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents\r\naccording to circumstances. That this should be so accords both with\r\ncommon sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession.\r\n\r\nIf this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of\r\nthe judges, and without any apparent partisan bias, and in accordance with\r\nlegal public expectation and with the steady practice of the departments\r\nthroughout our history, and had been in no part based on assumed\r\nhistorical facts which are not really true; or, if wanting in some of\r\nthese, it had been before the court more than once, and had there been\r\naffirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years, it then might be,\r\nperhaps would be, factious, nay, even revolutionary, not to acquiesce in\r\nit as a precedent.\r\n\r\nBut when, as is true, we find it wanting in all these claims to the public\r\nconfidence, it is not resistance, it is not factious, it is not even\r\ndisrespectful, to treat it as not having yet quite established a settled\r\ndoctrine for the country. But Judge Douglas considers this view awful.\r\nHear him:\r\n\r\n\"The courts are the tribunals prescribed by the Constitution and created\r\nby the authority of the people to determine, expound, and enforce the law.\r\nHence, whoever resists the final decision of the highest judicial tribunal\r\naims a deadly blow at our whole republican system of government--a blow\r\nwhich, if successful, would place all our rights and liberties at the\r\nmercy of passion, anarchy, and violence. I repeat, therefore, that if\r\nresistance to the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, in\r\na matter like the points decided in the Dred Scott case, clearly within\r\ntheir jurisdiction as defined by the Constitution, shall be forced upon\r\nthe country as a political issue, it will become a distinct and naked\r\nissue between the friends and enemies of the Constitution--the friends and\r\nthe enemies of the supremacy of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nWhy, this same Supreme Court once decided a national bank to be\r\nconstitutional; but General Jackson, as President of the United States,\r\ndisregarded the decision, and vetoed a bill for a recharter, partly on\r\nconstitutional ground, declaring that each public functionary must support\r\nthe Constitution \"as he understands it.\" But hear the General's own words.\r\nHere they are, taken from his veto message:\r\n\r\n\"It is maintained by the advocates of the bank that its constitutionality,\r\nin all its features, ought to be considered as settled by precedent, and\r\nby the decision of the Supreme Court. To this conclusion I cannot assent.\r\nMere precedent is a dangerous source of authority, and should not be\r\nregarded as deciding questions of constitutional power, except where\r\nthe acquiescence of the people and the States can be considered as well\r\nsettled. So far from this being the case on this subject, an argument\r\nagainst the bank might be based on precedent. One Congress, in 1791,\r\ndecided in favor of a bank; another, in 1811, decided against it. One\r\nCongress, in 1815, decided against a bank; another, in 1816, decided in\r\nits favor. Prior to the present Congress, therefore, the precedents drawn\r\nfrom that course were equal. If we resort to the States, the expressions\r\nof legislative, judicial, and executive opinions against the bank have\r\nbeen probably to those in its favor as four to one. There is nothing in\r\nprecedent, therefore, which, if its authority were admitted, ought to\r\nweigh in favor of the act before me.\"\r\n\r\nI drop the quotations merely to remark that all there ever was in the way\r\nof precedent up to the Dred Scott decision, on the points therein decided,\r\nhad been against that decision. But hear General Jackson further:\r\n\r\n\"If the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the whole ground of this act,\r\nit ought not to control the coordinate authorities of this government. The\r\nCongress, the executive, and the courts must, each for itself, be guided\r\nby its own opinion of the Constitution. Each public officer who takes\r\nan oath to support the Constitution swears that he will support it as he\r\nunderstands it, and not as it is understood by others.\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again have I heard Judge Douglas denounce that bank decision and\r\napplaud General Jackson for disregarding it. It would be interesting\r\nfor him to look over his recent speech, and see how exactly his fierce\r\nphilippics against us for resisting Supreme Court decisions fall upon his\r\nown head. It will call to mind a long and fierce political war in this\r\ncountry, upon an issue which, in his own language, and, of course, in his\r\nown changeless estimation, \"was a distinct issue between the friends and\r\nthe enemies of the Constitution,\" and in which war he fought in the ranks\r\nof the enemies of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI have said, in substance, that the Dred Scott decision was in part based\r\non assumed historical facts which were not really true, and I ought not to\r\nleave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this; I therefore\r\ngive an instance or two, which I think fully sustain me. Chief Justice\r\nTaney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court, insists at\r\ngreat length that negroes were no part of the people who made, or for\r\nwhom was made, the Declaration of Independence, or the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in\r\nfive of the then thirteen States--to wit, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nNew York, New Jersey, and North Carolina--free negroes were voters, and in\r\nproportion to their numbers had the same part in making the Constitution\r\nthat the white people had. He shows this with so much particularity as to\r\nleave no doubt of its truth; and as a sort of conclusion on that point,\r\nholds the following language:\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United\r\nStates, through the action, in each State, of those persons who were\r\nqualified by its laws to act thereon in behalf of themselves and all other\r\ncitizens of the State. In some of the States, as we have seen, colored\r\npersons were among those qualified by law to act on the subject. These\r\ncolored persons were not only included in the body of 'the people of the\r\nUnited States' by whom the Constitution was ordained and established; but\r\nin at least five of the States they had the power to act, and doubtless\r\ndid act, by their suffrages, upon the question of its adoption.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, Chief Justice Taney says:\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion, in\r\nrelation to that unfortunate race, which prevailed in the civilized\r\nand enlightened portions of the world at the time of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and when the Constitution of the United States was framed\r\nand adopted.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, after quoting from the Declaration, he says:\r\n\r\n\"The general words above quoted would seem to include the whole human\r\nfamily, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day, would\r\nbe so understood.\"\r\n\r\nIn these the Chief Justice does not directly assert, but plainly assumes\r\nas a fact, that the public estimate of the black man is more favorable now\r\nthan it was in the days of the Revolution. This assumption is a mistake.\r\nIn some trifling particulars the condition of that race has been\r\nameliorated; but as a whole, in this country, the change between then\r\nand now is decidedly the other way, and their ultimate destiny has never\r\nappeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years. In two of the\r\nfive States--New Jersey and North Carolina--that then gave the free\r\nnegro the right of voting, the right has since been taken away, and in\r\na third--New York--it has been greatly abridged; while it has not been\r\nextended, so far as I know, to a single additional State, though\r\nthe number of the States has more than doubled. In those days, as I\r\nunderstand, masters could, at their own pleasure, emancipate their slaves;\r\nbut since then such legal restraints have been made upon emancipation\r\nas to amount almost to prohibition. In those days Legislatures held the\r\nunquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective States, but now\r\nit is becoming quite fashionable for State constitutions to withhold that\r\npower from the Legislatures. In those days, by common consent, the spread\r\nof the black man's bondage to the new countries was prohibited, but\r\nnow Congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition, and the\r\nSupreme Court decides that it could not if it would. In those days our\r\nDeclaration of Independence was held sacred by all, and thought to include\r\nall; but now, to aid in making the bondage of the negro universal and\r\neternal, it is assailed and sneered at and construed and hawked at and\r\ntorn, till, if its framers could rise from their graves, they could not at\r\nall recognize it. All the powers of earth seem rapidly combining against\r\nhim. Mammon is after him, ambition follows, philosophy follows, and the\r\ntheology of the day fast joining the cry. They have him in his prison\r\nhouse; they have searched his person, and left no prying instrument with\r\nhim. One after another they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him;\r\nand now they have him, as it were, bolted in with a lock of hundred keys,\r\nwhich can never be unlocked without the concurrence of every key--the keys\r\nin the hands of a hundred different men, and they scattered to hundred\r\ndifferent and distant places; and they stand musing as to what invention,\r\nin all the dominions of mind and matter, can be produced to make the\r\nimpossibility of his escape more complete than it is.\r\n\r\nIt is grossly incorrect to say or assume that the public estimate of the\r\nnegro is more favorable now than it was at the origin of the government.\r\n\r\nThree years and a half ago, Judge Douglas brought forward his famous\r\nNebraska Bill. The country was at once in a blaze. He scorned all\r\nopposition, and carried it through Congress. Since then he has seen\r\nhimself superseded in a Presidential nomination by one indorsing the\r\ngeneral doctrine of his measure, but at the same time standing clear\r\nof the odium of its untimely agitation and its gross breach of national\r\nfaith; and he has seen that successful rival constitutionally elected, not\r\nby the strength of friends, but by the division of adversaries, being in\r\na popular minority of nearly four hundred thousand votes. He has seen his\r\nchief aids in his own State, Shields and Richardson, politically speaking,\r\nsuccessively tried, convicted, and executed for an offence not their own\r\nbut his. And now he sees his own case standing next on the docket for\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nThere is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people at the\r\nidea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races; and\r\nJudge Douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the chances of his\r\nbeing able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to himself. If he\r\ncan, by much drumming and repeating, fasten the odium of that idea upon\r\nhis adversaries, he thinks he can struggle through the storm. He therefore\r\nclings to this hope, as a drowning man to the last plank. He makes an\r\noccasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the Dred Scott decision.\r\nHe finds the Republicans insisting that the Declaration of Independence\r\nincludes all men, black as well as white, and forthwith he boldly denies\r\nthat it includes negroes at all, and proceeds to argue gravely that all\r\nwho contend it does, do so only because they want to vote, and eat,\r\nand sleep, and marry with negroes. He will have it that they cannot\r\nbe consistent else. Now I protest against the counterfeit logic which\r\nconcludes that, because I do not want a black woman for a slave I must\r\nnecessarily want her for a wife. I need not have her for either. I can\r\njust leave her alone. In some respects she certainly is not my equal;\r\nbut in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands,\r\nwithout asking leave of any one else, she is my equal and the equal of all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Taney, in his opinion in the Dred Scott case, admits that\r\nthe language of the Declaration is broad enough to include the whole human\r\nfamily, but he and Judge Douglas argue that the authors of that instrument\r\ndid not intend to include negroes, by the fact that they did not at\r\nonce actually place them on an equality with the whites. Now this grave\r\nargument comes to just nothing at all, by the other fact that they did not\r\nat once, or ever afterward, actually place all white people on an equality\r\nwith one another. And this is the staple argument of both the Chief\r\nJustice and the Senator for doing this obvious violence to the plain,\r\nunmistakable language of the Declaration.\r\n\r\nI think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all\r\nmen, but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects.\r\nThey did not mean to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral\r\ndevelopments, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness\r\nin what respects they did consider all men created equal--equal with\r\n\"certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness.\" This they said, and this they meant. They did not\r\nmean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying\r\nthat equality, nor yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon\r\nthem. In fact, they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply\r\nto declare the right, so that enforcement of it might follow as fast as\r\ncircumstances should permit.\r\n\r\nThey meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which should be\r\nfamiliar to all, and revered by all; constantly looked to, constantly\r\nlabored for, and, even though never perfectly attained, constantly\r\napproximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence\r\nand augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors\r\neverywhere. The assertion that \"all men are created equal\" was of no\r\npractical use in effecting our separation from Great Britain; and it was\r\nplaced in the Declaration not for that, but for future use. Its authors\r\nmeant it to be--as thank God, it is now proving itself--stumbling-block\r\nto all those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back into\r\nthe hateful paths of despotism. They knew the proneness of prosperity to\r\nbreed tyrants, and they meant when such should reappear in this fair land\r\nand commence their vocation, they should find left for them at least one\r\nhard nut to crack.\r\n\r\nI have now briefly expressed my view of the meaning and object of that\r\npart of the Declaration of Independence which declares that \"all men are\r\ncreated equal.\"\r\n\r\nNow let us hear Judge Douglas's view of the same subject, as I find it in\r\nthe printed report of his late speech. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\"No man can vindicate the character, motives, and conduct of the signers\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, except upon the hypothesis that\r\nthey referred to the white race alone, and not to the African, when they\r\ndeclared all men to have been created equal; that they were speaking of\r\nBritish subjects on this continent being equal to British subjects\r\nborn and residing in Great Britain; that they were entitled to the same\r\ninalienable rights, and among them were enumerated life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness. The Declaration was adopted for the purpose of\r\njustifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing\r\ntheir allegiance from the British crown, and dissolving their connection\r\nwith the mother country.\"\r\n\r\nMy good friends, read that carefully over some leisure hour, and ponder\r\nwell upon it; see what a mere wreck--mangled ruin--it makes of our once\r\nglorious Declaration.\r\n\r\n\"They were speaking of British subjects on this continent being equal to\r\nBritish subjects born and residing in Great Britain\"! Why, according\r\nto this, not only negroes but white people outside of Great Britain and\r\nAmerica were not spoken of in that instrument. The English, Irish, and\r\nScotch, along with white Americans, were included, to be sure, but the\r\nFrench, Germans, and other white people of the world are all gone to pot\r\nalong with the Judge's inferior races!\r\n\r\nI had thought the Declaration promised something better than the condition\r\nof British subjects; but no, it only meant that we should be equal to them\r\nin their own oppressed and unequal condition. According to that, it gave\r\nno promise that, having kicked off the king and lords of Great Britain, we\r\nshould not at once be saddled with a king and lords of our own.\r\n\r\nI had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in\r\nthe condition of all men everywhere; but no, it merely \"was adopted for\r\nthe purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world\r\nin withdrawing their allegiance from the British crown, and dissolving\r\ntheir connection with the mother country.\" Why, that object having been\r\neffected some eighty years ago, the Declaration is of no practical use\r\nnow--mere rubbish--old wadding left to rot on the battlefield after the\r\nvictory is won.\r\n\r\nI understand you are preparing to celebrate the \"Fourth,\" to-morrow week.\r\nWhat for? The doings of that day had no reference to the present; and\r\nquite half of you are not even descendants of those who were referred to\r\nat that day. But I suppose you will celebrate, and will even go so far\r\nas to read the Declaration. Suppose, after you read it once in the\r\nold-fashioned way, you read it once more with Judge Douglas's version. It\r\nwill then run thus:\r\n\r\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all British subjects who\r\nwere on this continent eighty-one years ago were created equal to all\r\nBritish subjects born and then residing in Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now I appeal to all--to Democrats as well as others--are you really\r\nwilling that the Declaration shall thus be frittered away?--thus left no\r\nmore, at most, than an interesting memorial of the dead past?--thus shorn\r\nof its vitality and practical value, and left without the germ or even the\r\nsuggestion of the individual rights of man in it?\r\n\r\nBut Judge Douglas is especially horrified at the thought of the mixing\r\nof blood by the white and black races. Agreed for once--a thousand times\r\nagreed. There are white men enough to marry all the white women and black\r\nmen enough to many all the black women; and so let them be married. On\r\nthis point we fully agree with the Judge, and when he shall show that his\r\npolicy is better adapted to prevent amalgamation than ours, we shall drop\r\nours and adopt his. Let us see. In 1850 there were in the United States\r\n405,751 mulattoes. Very few of these are the offspring of whites and free\r\nblacks; nearly all have sprung from black slaves and white masters. A\r\nseparation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation;\r\nbut as an immediate separation is impossible, the next best thing is to\r\nkeep them apart where they are not already together. If white and black\r\npeople never get together in Kansas, they will never mix blood in Kansas.\r\nThat is at least one self-evident truth. A few free colored persons\r\nmay get into the free States, in any event; but their number is too\r\ninsignificant to amount to much in the way of mixing blood. In 1850 there\r\nwere in the free States 56,649 mulattoes; but for the most part they were\r\nnot born there--they came from the slave States, ready made up. In the\r\nsame year the slave States had 348,874 mulattoes, all of home production.\r\nThe proportion of free mulattoes to free blacks--the only colored classes\r\nin the free States is much greater in the slave than in the free States.\r\nIt is worthy of note, too, that among the free States those which make the\r\ncolored man the nearest equal to the white have proportionably the fewest\r\nmulattoes, the least of amalgamation. In New Hampshire, the State which\r\ngoes farthest toward equality between the races, there are just 184\r\nmulattoes, while there are in Virginia--how many do you think?--79,775,\r\nbeing 23,126 more than in all the free States together.\r\n\r\nThese statistics show that slavery is the greatest source of amalgamation,\r\nand next to it, not the elevation, but the degradation of the free\r\nblacks. Yet Judge Douglas dreads the slightest restraints on the spread\r\nof slavery, and the slightest human recognition of the negro, as tending\r\nhorribly to amalgamation!\r\n\r\nThe very Dred Scott case affords a strong test as to which party most\r\nfavors amalgamation, the Republicans or the dear Union-saving Democracy.\r\nDred Scott, his wife, and two daughters were all involved in the suit. We\r\ndesired the court to have held that they were citizens so far at least\r\nas to entitle them to a hearing as to whether they were free or not; and\r\nthen, also, that they were in fact and in law really free. Could we have\r\nhad our way, the chances of these black girls ever mixing their blood with\r\nthat of white people would have been diminished at least to the extent\r\nthat it could not have been without their consent. But Judge Douglas is\r\ndelighted to have them decided to be slaves, and not human enough to have\r\na hearing, even if they were free, and thus left subject to the forced\r\nconcubinage of their masters, and liable to become the mothers of\r\nmulattoes in spite of themselves: the very state of case that produces\r\nnine tenths of all the mulattoes all the mixing of blood in the nation.\r\n\r\nOf course, I state this case as an illustration only, not meaning to say\r\nor intimate that the master of Dred Scott and his family, or any more\r\nthan a percentage of masters generally, are inclined to exercise this\r\nparticular power which they hold over their female slaves.\r\n\r\nI have said that the separation of the races is the only perfect\r\npreventive of amalgamation. I have no right to say all the members of the\r\nRepublican party are in favor of this, nor to say that as a party they\r\nare in favor of it. There is nothing in their platform directly on the\r\nsubject. But I can say a very large proportion of its members are for it,\r\nand that the chief plank in their platform--opposition to the spread of\r\nslavery--is most favorable to that separation.\r\n\r\nSuch separation, if ever effected at all, must be effected by\r\ncolonization; and no political party, as such, is now doing anything\r\ndirectly for colonization. Party operations at present only favor or\r\nretard colonization incidentally. The enterprise is a difficult one; but\r\n\"where there is a will there is a way,\" and what colonization needs most\r\nis a hearty will. Will springs from the two elements of moral sense and\r\nself-interest. Let us be brought to believe it is morally right, and\r\nat the same time favorable to, or at least not against, our interest to\r\ntransfer the African to his native clime, and we shall find a way to do\r\nit, however great the task may be. The children of Israel, to such numbers\r\nas to include four hundred thousand fighting men, went out of Egyptian\r\nbondage in a body.\r\n\r\nHow differently the respective courses of the Democratic and Republican\r\nparties incidentally, bear on the question of forming a will--a public\r\nsentiment--for colonization, is easy to see. The Republicans inculcate,\r\nwith whatever of ability they can, that the negro is a man, that his\r\nbondage is cruelly wrong, and that the field of his oppression ought\r\nnot to be enlarged. The Democrats deny his manhood; deny, or dwarf to\r\ninsignificance, the wrong of his bondage; so far as possible crush all\r\nsympathy for him, and cultivate and excite hatred and disgust against\r\nhim; compliment themselves as Union-savers for doing so; and call\r\nthe indefinite outspreading of his bondage \"a sacred right of\r\nself-government.\"\r\n\r\nThe plainest print cannot be read through a gold eagle; and it will be\r\never hard to find many men who will send a slave to Liberia, and pay\r\nhis passage, while they can send him to a new country--Kansas, for\r\ninstance--and sell him for fifteen hundred dollars, and the rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM GRIMES.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, August, 1857\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 14th is received, and I am much obliged for the\r\nlegal information you give.\r\n\r\nYou can scarcely be more anxious than I that the next election in Iowa\r\nshould result in favor of the Republicans. I lost nearly all the working\r\npart of last year, giving my time to the canvass; and I am altogether\r\ntoo poor to lose two years together. I am engaged in a suit in the United\r\nStates Court at Chicago, in which the Rock Island Bridge Company is a\r\nparty. The trial is to commence on the 8th of September, and probably will\r\nlast two or three weeks. During the trial it is not improbable that\r\nall hands may come over and take a look at the bridge, and, if it were\r\npossible to make it hit right, I could then speak at Davenport. My courts\r\ngo right on without cessation till late in November. Write me again,\r\npointing out the more striking points of difference between your old and\r\nnew constitutions, and also whether Democratic and Republican party\r\nlines were drawn in the adoption of it, and which were for and which were\r\nagainst it. If, by possibility, I could get over among you it might be of\r\nsome advantage to know these things in advance.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARGUMENT IN THE ROCK ISLAND BRIDGE CASE.\r\n\r\n(From the Daily Press of Chicago, Sept. 24, 1857.)\r\n\r\nHurd et al. vs Railroad Bridge Co.\r\n\r\nUnited States Circuit Court, Hon. John McLean, Presiding Judge.\r\n\r\n13th day, Tuesday, Sept. 22, 1857.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Lincoln addressed the jury. He said he did not purpose to assail\r\nanybody, that he expected to grow earnest as he proceeded but not\r\nill-natured. \"There is some conflict of testimony in the case,\" he said,\r\n\"but one quarter of such a number of witnesses seldom agree, and even if\r\nall were on one side some discrepancy might be expected. We are to try and\r\nreconcile them, and to believe that they are not intentionally erroneous\r\nas long as we can.\" He had no prejudice, he said, against steamboats or\r\nsteamboat men nor any against St. Louis, for he supposed they went about\r\nthis matter as other people would do in their situation. \"St. Louis,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"as a commercial place may desire that this bridge should not\r\nstand, as it is adverse to her commerce, diverting a portion of it from\r\nthe river; and it may be that she supposes that the additional cost of\r\nrailroad transportation upon the productions of Iowa will force them to\r\ngo to St. Louis if this bridge is removed. The meetings in St. Louis are\r\nconnected with this case only as some witnesses are in it, and thus has\r\nsome prejudice added color to their testimony.\" The last thing that would\r\nbe pleasing to him, Mr. Lincoln said, would be to have one of these great\r\nchannels, extending almost from where it never freezes to where it never\r\nthaws, blocked up, but there is a travel from east to west whose demands\r\nare not less important than those of the river. It is growing larger and\r\nlarger, building up new countries with a rapidity never before seen in the\r\nhistory of the world. He alluded to the astonishing growth of Illinois,\r\nhaving grown within his memory to a population of a million and a half; to\r\nIowa and the other young rising communities of the Northwest.\r\n\r\n\"This current of travel,\" said he, \"has its rights as well as that of\r\nnorth and south. If the river had not the advantage in priority and\r\nlegislation we could enter into free competition with it and we could\r\nsurpass it. This particular railroad line has a great importance and the\r\nstatement of its business during a little less than a year shows this\r\nimportance. It is in evidence that from September 8, 1856, to August 8,\r\n1857, 12,586 freight cars and 74,179 passengers passed over this bridge.\r\nNavigation was closed four days short of four months last year, and\r\nduring this time while the river was of no use this road and bridge were\r\nvaluable. There is, too, a considerable portion of time when floating or\r\nthin ice makes the river useless while the bridge is as useful as ever.\r\nThis shows that this bridge must be treated with respect in this court and\r\nis not to be kicked about with contempt. The other day Judge Wead alluded\r\nto the strike of the contending interest and even a dissolution of the\r\nUnion. The proper mode for all parties in this affair is to 'live and let\r\nlive,' and then we will find a cessation of this trouble about the bridge.\r\nWhat mood were the steamboat men in when this bridge was burned? Why,\r\nthere was a shouting and ringing of bells and whistling on all the boats\r\nas it fell. It was a jubilee, a greater celebration than follows an\r\nexcited election. The first thing I will proceed to is the record of Mr.\r\nGurney and the complaint of Judge Wead that the record did not extend back\r\nover all the time from the completion of the bridge. The principal part of\r\nthe navigation after the bridge was burned passed through the span. When\r\nthe bridge was repaired and the boats were a second time confined to the\r\ndraw it was provided that this record should be kept. That is the simple\r\nhistory of that book.\r\n\r\n\"From April 19th, 1856, to May 6th--seventeen days--there were twenty\r\naccidents and all the time since then there have been but twenty hits,\r\nincluding seven accidents, so that the dangers of this place are tapering\r\noff and as the boatmen get cool the accidents get less. We may soon expect\r\nif this ratio is kept up that there will be no accidents at all.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Wead said, while admitting that the floats went straight through,\r\nthere was a difference between a float and a boat, but I do not remember\r\nthat he indulged us with an argument in support of this statement. Is it\r\nbecause there is a difference in size? Will not a small body and a large\r\none float the same way under the same influence? True a flatboat will\r\nfloat faster than an egg shell and the egg shell might be blown away by\r\nthe wind, but if under the same influence they would go the same way.\r\nLogs, floats, boards, various things the witnesses say all show the same\r\ncurrent. Then is not this test reliable? At all depths too the direction\r\nof the current is the same. A series of these floats would make a line as\r\nlong as a boat and would show any influence upon any part and all parts of\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\n\"I will now speak of the angular position of the piers. What is the amount\r\nof the angle? The course of the river is a curve and the pier is straight.\r\nIf a line is produced from the upper end of the long pier straight with\r\nthe pier to a distance of 350 feet, and a line is drawn from a point in\r\nthe channel opposite this point to the head of the pier, Colonel Nason\r\nsays they will form an angle of twenty degrees. But the angle if measured\r\nat the pier is seven degrees; that is, we would have to move the pier\r\nseven degrees to make it exactly straight with the current. Would that\r\nmake the navigation better or worse? The witnesses of the plaintiff seem\r\nto think it was only necessary to say that the pier formed an angle with\r\nthe current and that settled the matter. Our more careful and accurate\r\nwitnesses say that, though they had been accustomed to seeing the piers\r\nplaced straight with the current, yet they could see that here the current\r\nhad been made straight by us in having made this slight angle; that the\r\nwater now runs just right, that it is straight and cannot be improved.\r\nThey think that if the pier was changed the eddy would be divided and the\r\nnavigation improved.\r\n\r\n\"I am not now going to discuss the question what is a material\r\nobstruction. We do not greatly differ about the law. The cases produced\r\nhere are, I suppose, proper to be taken into consideration by the court in\r\ninstructing a jury. Some of them I think are not exactly in point, but\r\nI am still willing to trust his honor, Judge McLean, and take his\r\ninstructions as law. What is reasonable skill and care? This is a thing\r\nof which the jury are to judge. I differ from the other side when it says\r\nthat they are bound to exercise no more care than was taken before the\r\nbuilding of the bridge. If we are allowed by the Legislature to build the\r\nbridge which will require them to do more than before, when a pilot comes\r\nalong, it is unreasonable for him to dash on heedless of this structure\r\nwhich has been legally put there. The Afton came there on the 5th and lay\r\nat Rock Island until next morning. When a boat lies up the pilot has a\r\nholiday, and would not any of these jurors have then gone around to the\r\nbridge and gotten acquainted with the place? Pilot Parker has shown here\r\nthat he does not understand the draw. I heard him say that the fall from\r\nthe head to the foot of the pier was four feet; he needs information. He\r\ncould have gone there that day and seen there was no such fall. He should\r\nhave discarded passion and the chances are that he would have had no\r\ndisaster at all. He was bound to make himself acquainted with the place.\r\n\r\n\"McCammon says that the current and the swell coming from the long pier\r\ndrove her against the long pier. In other words drove her toward the very\r\npier from which the current came! It is an absurdity, an impossibility.\r\nThe only recollection I can find for this contradiction is in a current\r\nwhich White says strikes out from the long pier and then like a ram's horn\r\nturns back, and this might have acted somehow in this manner.\r\n\r\n\"It is agreed by all that the plaintiff's boat was destroyed and that it\r\nwas destroyed upon the head of the short pier; that she moved from the\r\nchannel where she was with her bow above the head of the long pier, till\r\nshe struck the short one, swung around under the bridge and there was\r\ncrowded and destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"I shall try to prove that the average velocity of the current through the\r\ndraw with the boat in it should be five and a half miles an hour; that it\r\nis slowest at the head of the pier and swiftest at the foot of the pier.\r\nTheir lowest estimate in evidence is six miles an hour, their highest\r\ntwelve miles. This was the testimony of men who had made no experiment,\r\nonly conjecture. We have adopted the most exact means. The water runs\r\nswiftest in high water and we have taken the point of nine feet above low\r\nwater. The water when the Afton was lost was seven feet above low water,\r\nor at least a foot lower than our time. Brayton and his assistants timed\r\nthe instruments, the best instruments known in measuring currents. They\r\ntimed them under various circumstances and they found the current five\r\nmiles an hour and no more. They found that the water at the upper end ran\r\nslower than five miles; that below it was swifter than five miles, but\r\nthat the average was five miles. Shall men who have taken no care, who\r\nconjecture, some of whom speak of twenty miles an hour, be believed\r\nagainst those who have had such a favorable and well improved opportunity?\r\nThey should not even qualify the result. Several men have given their\r\nopinion as to the distance of the steamboat Carson, and I suppose if one\r\nshould go and measure that distance you would believe him in preference to\r\nall of them.\r\n\r\n\"These measurements were made when the boat was not in the draw. It has\r\nbeen ascertained what is the area of the cross section of this stream and\r\nthe area of the face of the piers, and the engineers say that the piers\r\nbeing put there will increase the current proportionally as the space\r\nis decreased. So with the boat in the draw. The depth of the channel was\r\ntwenty-two feet, the width one hundred and sixteen feet; multiply these\r\nand you have the square-feet across the water of the draw, viz.: 2552\r\nfeet. The Afton was 35 feet wide and drew 5 feet, making a fourteenth\r\nof the sum. Now, one-fourteenth of five miles is five-fourteenths of one\r\nmile--about one third of a mile--the increase of the current. We will call\r\nthe current five and a half miles per hour. The next thing I will try to\r\nprove is that the plaintiff's (?) boat had power to run six miles an hour\r\nin that current. It had been testified that she was a strong, swift boat,\r\nable to run eight miles an hour up stream in a current of four miles an\r\nhour, and fifteen miles down stream. Strike the average and you will find\r\nwhat is her average--about eleven and a half miles. Take the five and a\r\nhalf miles which is the speed of the current in the draw and it leaves the\r\npower of that boat in that draw at six miles an hour, 528 feet per minute\r\nand 8 4/5 feet to the second.\r\n\r\n\"Next I propose to show that there are no cross currents. I know their\r\nwitnesses say that there are cross currents--that, as one witness says,\r\nthere were three cross currents and two eddies; so far as mere statement,\r\nwithout experiment, and mingled with mistakes, can go, they have proved.\r\nBut can these men's testimony be compared with the nice, exact, thorough\r\nexperiments of our witnesses? Can you believe that these floats go across\r\nthe currents? It is inconceivable that they could not have discovered\r\nevery possible current. How do boats find currents that floats cannot\r\ndiscover? We assume the position then that those cross currents are not\r\nthere. My next proposition is that the Afton passed between the S. B.\r\nCarson and the Iowa shore. That is undisputed.\r\n\r\n\"Next I shall show that she struck first the short pier, then the long\r\npier, then the short one again and there she stopped.\" Mr. Lincoln then\r\ncited the testimony of eighteen witnesses on this point.\r\n\r\n\"How did the boat strike when she went in? Here is an endless variety of\r\nopinion. But ten of them say what pier she struck; three of them testify\r\nthat she struck first the short, then the long and then the short for the\r\nlast time. None of the rest substantially contradict this. I assume that\r\nthese men have got the truth because I believe it an established fact.\r\nMy next proposition is that after she struck the short and long pier and\r\nbefore she got back to the short pier the boat got right with her bow\r\nup. So says the pilot Parker--that he got her through until her starboard\r\nwheel passed the short pier. This would make her head about even with the\r\nhead of the long pier. He says her head was as high or higher than the\r\nhead of the long pier. Other witnesses confirmed this one. The final\r\nstroke was in the splash door aft the wheel. Witnesses differ, but the\r\nmajority say that she struck thus.\"\r\n\r\nCourt adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n14th day, Wednesday, Sept. 23, 1857.\r\n\r\nMr. A. LINCOLN resumed. He said he should conclude as soon as possible.\r\nHe said the colored map of the plaintiff which was brought in during one\r\nstage of the trial showed itself that the cross currents alleged did not\r\nexist. That the current as represented would drive an ascending boat to\r\nthe long pier but not to the short pier, as they urge. He explained from a\r\nmodel of a boat where the splash door is, just behind the wheel. The boat\r\nstruck on the lower shoulder of the short pier as she swung around in the\r\nsplash door; then as she went on around she struck the point or end of\r\nthe pier, where she rested. \"Her engineers,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"say the\r\nstarboard wheel then was rushing around rapidly. Then the boat must have\r\nstruck the upper point of the pier so far back as not to disturb the\r\nwheel. It is forty feet from the stern of the Afton to the splash door,\r\nand thus it appears that she had but forty feet to go to clear the pier.\r\nHow was it that the Afton with all her power flanked over from the channel\r\nto the short pier without moving one foot ahead? Suppose she was in the\r\nmiddle of the draw, her wheel would have been 31 feet from the short pier.\r\nThe reason she went over thus is her starboard wheel was not working. I\r\nshall try to establish the fact that the wheel was not running and that\r\nafter she struck she went ahead strong on this same wheel. Upon the last\r\npoint the witnesses agree, that the starboard wheel was running after she\r\nstruck, and no witnesses say that it was running while she was out in the\r\ndraw flanking over.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln read from the testimonies of various witnesses to prove that\r\nthe starboard wheel was not working while the Afton was out in the stream.\r\n\r\n\"Other witnesses show that the captain said something of the machinery of\r\nthe wheel, and the inference is that he knew the wheel was not working.\r\nThe fact is undisputed that she did not move one inch ahead while she was\r\nmoving this 31 feet sideways. There is evidence proving that the current\r\nthere is only five miles an hour, and the only explanation is that her\r\npower was not all used--that only one wheel was working. The pilot says\r\nhe ordered the engineers to back her up. The engineers differ from him\r\nand said they kept on going ahead. The bow was so swung that the current\r\npressed it over; the pilot pressed the stern over with the rudder, though\r\nnot so fast but that the bow gained on it, and only one wheel being\r\nin motion the boat nearly stood still so far as motion up and down is\r\nconcerned, and thus she was thrown upon this pier. The Afton came into the\r\ndraw after she had just passed the Carson, and as the Carson no doubt kept\r\nthe true course the Afton going around her got out of the proper way, got\r\nacross the current into the eddy which is west of a straight line drawn\r\ndown from the long pier, was compelled to resort to these changes of\r\nwheels, which she did not do with sufficient adroitness to save her. Was\r\nit not her own fault that she entered wrong, so far wrong that she never\r\ngot right? Is the defence to blame for that?\r\n\r\n\"For several days we were entertained with depositions about boats\r\n'smelling a bar.' Why did the Afton then, after she had come up smelling\r\nso close to the long pier sheer off so strangely. When she got to the\r\ncentre of the very nose she was smelling she seemed suddenly to have lost\r\nher sense of smell and to have flanked over to the short pier.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said there was no practicability in the project of building\r\na tunnel under the river, for there \"is not a tunnel that is a successful\r\nproject in this world. A suspension bridge cannot be built so high but\r\nthat the chimneys of the boats will grow up till they cannot pass. The\r\nsteamboat men will take pains to make them grow. The cars of a railroad\r\ncannot without immense expense rise high enough to get even with a\r\nsuspension bridge or go low enough to get through a tunnel; such expense\r\nis unreasonable.\r\n\r\n\"The plaintiffs have to establish that the bridge is a material\r\nobstruction and that they have managed their boat with reasonable care and\r\nskill. As to the last point high winds have nothing to do with it, for it\r\nwas not a windy day. They must show due skill and care. Difficulties going\r\ndown stream will not do, for they were going up stream. Difficulties\r\nwith barges in tow have nothing to do with the accident, for they had no\r\nbarge.\" Mr. Lincoln said he had much more to say, many things he could\r\nsuggest to the jury, but he wished to close to save time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JESSE K. DUBOIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DUBOIS:\r\n\r\nBLOOMINGTON, Dec. 19, 1857.\r\n\r\nJ. M. Douglas of the I. C. R. R. Co. is here and will carry this letter.\r\nHe says they have a large sum (near $90,000) which they will pay into the\r\ntreasury now, if they have an assurance that they shall not be sued\r\nbefore Jan., 1859--otherwise not. I really wish you could consent to this.\r\nDouglas says they cannot pay more, and I believe him.\r\n\r\nI do not write this as a lawyer seeking an advantage for a client; but\r\nonly as a friend, only urging you to do what I think I would do if I were\r\nin your situation. I mean this as private and confidential only, but I\r\nfeel a good deal of anxiety about it.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan. 19, 1858.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: This morning Col. McClernand showed me a petition for a\r\nmandamus against the Secretary of State to compel him to certify the\r\napportionment act of last session; and he says it will be presented to the\r\ncourt to-morrow morning. We shall be allowed three or four days to get up\r\na return, and I, for one, want the benefit of consultation with you.\r\n\r\nPlease come right up.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Feb 7, 1858\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Yesterday morning the court overruled the demurrer to Hatches\r\nreturn in the mandamus case. McClernand was present; said nothing about\r\npleading over; and so I suppose the matter is ended.\r\n\r\nThe court gave no reason for the decision; but Peck tells me\r\nconfidentially that they were unanimous in the opinion that even if the\r\nGov'r had signed the bill purposely, he had the right to scratch his name\r\noff so long as the bill remained in his custody and control.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, December 18, 1857.\r\n\r\nHENRY C. WHITNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Coming home from Bloomington last night I found your letter\r\nof the 15th.\r\n\r\nI know of no express statute or decisions as to what a J. P. upon the\r\nexpiration of his term shall do with his docket books, papers, unfinished\r\nbusiness, etc., but so far as I know, the practice has been to hand over\r\nto the successor, and to cease to do anything further whatever, in perfect\r\nanalogy to Sections 110 and 112, and I have supposed and do suppose this\r\nis the law. I think the successor may forthwith do whatever the retiring\r\nJ. P. might have done. As to the proviso to Section 114 I think it was put\r\nin to cover possible cases, by way of caution, and not to authorize the J.\r\nP. to go forward and finish up whatever might have been begun by him.\r\n\r\nThe view I take, I believe, is the Common law principle, as to retiring\r\nofficers and their successors, to which I remember but one exception,\r\nwhich is the case of Sheriff and ministerial officers of that class.\r\n\r\nI have not had time to examine this subject fully, but I have great\r\nconfidence I am right. You must not think of offering me pay for this.\r\n\r\nMr. John O. Johnson is my friend; I gave your name to him. He is doing the\r\nwork of trying to get up a Republican organization. I do not suppose \"Long\r\nJohn\" ever saw or heard of him. Let me say to you confidentially, that I\r\ndo not entirely appreciate what the Republican papers of Chicago are\r\nso constantly saying against \"Long John.\" I consider those papers truly\r\ndevoted to the Republican cause, and not unfriendly to me; but I do think\r\nthat more of what they say against \"Long John\" is dictated by personal\r\nmalice than themselves are conscious of. We can not afford to lose the\r\nservices of \"Long John\" and I do believe the unrelenting warfare made upon\r\nhim is injuring our cause. I mean this to be confidential.\r\n\r\nIf you quietly co-operate with Mr. J. O. Johnson on getting up an\r\norganization, I think it will be right.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1858\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER POLITICAL PATRONAGE REFERENCE\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD G. MINER.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Feb.19, 1858.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nMr. G. A. Sutton is an applicant for superintendent of the addition of the\r\nInsane Asylum, and I understand it partly depends on you whether he gets\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSutton is my fellow-townsman and friend, and I therefore wish to say for\r\nhim that he is a man of sterling integrity and as a master mechanic and\r\nbuilder not surpassed by any in our city, or any I have known anywhere, as\r\nfar as I can judge. I hope you will consider me as being really interested\r\nfor Mr. Sutton and not as writing merely to relieve myself of importunity.\r\nPlease show this to Col. William Ross and let him consider it as much\r\nintended for him as for yourself.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\nTO W. H. LAMON, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, JUNE 11, 1858\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 9th written at Joliet is just received. Two or\r\nthree days ago I learned that McLean had appointed delegates in favor\r\nof Lovejoy, and thenceforward I have considered his renomination a fixed\r\nfact. My opinion--if my opinion is of any consequence in this case, in\r\nwhich it is no business of mine to interfere--remains unchanged, that\r\nrunning an independent candidate against Lovejoy will not do; that it will\r\nresult in nothing but disaster all round. In the first place, whosoever\r\nso runs will be beaten and will be spotted for life; in the second place,\r\nwhile the race is in progress, he will be under the strongest temptation\r\nto trade with the Democrats, and to favor the election of certain of their\r\nfriends to the Legislature; thirdly, I shall be held responsible for it,\r\nand Republican members of the Legislature who are partial to Lovejoy will\r\nfor that purpose oppose us; and lastly, it will in the end lose us the\r\ndistrict altogether. There is no safe way but a convention; and if in that\r\nconvention, upon a common platform which all are willing to stand upon,\r\none who has been known as an abolitionist, but who is now occupying none\r\nbut common ground, can get the majority of the votes to which all look for\r\nan election, there is no safe way but to submit.\r\n\r\nAs to the inclination of some Republicans to favor Douglas, that is one of\r\nthe chances I have to run, and which I intend to run with patience.\r\n\r\nI write in the court room. Court has opened, and I must close.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIEF AUTOBIOGRAPHY,\r\n\r\nJUNE 15, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe compiler of the Dictionary of Congress states that while preparing\r\nthat work for publication, in 1858, he sent to Mr. Lincoln the usual\r\nrequest for a sketch of his life, and received the following reply:\r\n\r\n   Born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky.\r\n   Education, defective.\r\n   Profession, a lawyer.\r\n   Have been a captain of volunteers in Black Hawk war.\r\n   Postmaster at a very small office.\r\n   Four times a member of the Illinois Legislature and was\r\n   a member of the lower house of Congress.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAPERS AND WRITINGS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\nVOLUME THREE\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL EDITION\r\n\r\nBy Abraham Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited by Arthur Brooks Lapsley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATES I\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL SPEECHES & DEBATES of LINCOLN WITH DOUGLAS In the Senatorial\r\nCampaign of 1858 in Illinois SPEECH AT SPRINGFIELD, JUNE 17, 1858\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following speech was delivered at Springfield, Ill., at the close of\r\nthe Republican State Convention held at that time and place, and by which\r\nConvention Mr. LINCOLN had been named as their candidate for United States\r\nSenator. Mr. DOUGLAS was not present.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE CONVENTION:--If we could first know\r\nwhere we are, and whither we are tending, we could better judge what to\r\ndo, and how to do it. We are now far into the fifth year since a policy\r\nwas initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting\r\nan end to slavery agitation. Under the operation of that policy, that\r\nagitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my\r\nopinion, it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and\r\npassed. \"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\" I believe this\r\ngovernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not\r\nexpect the Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but\r\nI do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing,\r\nor all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further\r\nspread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief\r\nthat it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will\r\npush it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old\r\nas well as new, North as well as South.\r\n\r\nHave we no tendency to the latter condition?\r\n\r\nLet any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now almost complete\r\nlegal combination-piece of machinery, so to speak compounded of the\r\nNebraska doctrine and the Dred Scott decision. Let him consider, not only\r\nwhat work the machinery is adapted to do, and how well adapted, but also\r\nlet him study the history of its construction, and trace, if he can, or\r\nrather fail, if he can, to trace the evidences of design, and concert of\r\naction, among its chief architects, from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the\r\nStates by State Constitutions, and from most of the National territory by\r\nCongressional prohibition. Four days later, commenced the struggle which\r\nended in repealing that Congressional prohibition. This opened all the\r\nNational territory to slavery, and was the first point gained.\r\n\r\nBut, so far, Congress only had acted, and an indorsement by the people,\r\nreal or apparent, was indispensable to save the point already gained, and\r\ngive chance for more.\r\n\r\nThis necessity had not been overlooked, but had been provided for, as well\r\nas might be, in the notable argument of \"squatter sovereignty,\" otherwise\r\ncalled \"sacred right of self-government,\" which latter phrase, though\r\nexpressive of the only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted\r\nin this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: That if any one man\r\nchoose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed to object. That\r\nargument was incorporated into the Nebraska Bill itself, in the language\r\nwhich follows:\r\n\r\n\"It being the true intent and meaning of this Act not to legislate slavery\r\ninto any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave\r\nthe people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic\r\ninstitutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nThen opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of \"squatter\r\nsovereignty,\" and \"sacred right of self-government.\" \"But,\" said\r\nopposition members, \"let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare\r\nthat the people of the Territory may exclude slavery.\" \"Not we,\" said the\r\nfriends of the measure, and down they voted the amendment.\r\n\r\nWhile the Nebraska Bill was passing through Congress, a law case,\r\ninvolving the question of a negro's freedom, by reason of his owner having\r\nvoluntarily taken him first into a free State, and then into a territory\r\ncovered by the Congressional Prohibition, and held him as a slave for a\r\nlong time in each, was passing through the United States Circuit Court for\r\nthe District of Missouri; and both Nebraska Bill and lawsuit were brought\r\nto a decision in the same month of May, 1854. The negro's name was \"Dred\r\nScott,\" which name now designates the decision finally made in the case.\r\nBefore the then next Presidential election, the law case came to, and was\r\nargued in, the Supreme Court of the United States; but the decision of it\r\nwas deferred until after the election. Still, before the election, Senator\r\nTrumbull, on the floor of the Senate, requested the leading advocate of\r\nthe Nebraska Bill to state his opinion whether the people of a territory\r\ncan constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits; and the latter\r\nanswers: \"That is a question for the Supreme Court.\"\r\n\r\nThe election came. Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the indorsement, such\r\nas it was, secured. That was the second point gained. The indorsement,\r\nhowever, fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred\r\nthousand votes,(approximately 10% of the vote) and so, perhaps, was not\r\noverwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory. The outgoing President, in his\r\nlast annual message, as impressively as possible echoed back upon the\r\npeople the weight and authority of the indorsement. The Supreme Court\r\nmet again, did not announce their decision, but ordered a reargument. The\r\nPresidential inauguration came, and still no decision of the court; but\r\nthe incoming President, in his inaugural address, fervently exhorted the\r\npeople to abide by the forth-coming decision, whatever it might be. Then,\r\nin a few days, came the decision.\r\n\r\nThe reputed author of the Nebraska Bill finds an early occasion to make a\r\nspeech at this capital indorsing the Dred Scott decision, and vehemently\r\ndenouncing all opposition to it. The new President, too, seizes the early\r\noccasion of the Silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that\r\ndecision, and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever\r\nbeen entertained!\r\n\r\nAt length a squabble springs up between the President and the author of\r\nthe Nebraska Bill, on the mere question of fact, whether the Lecompton\r\nConstitution was or was not in any just sense made by the people of\r\nKansas; and in that quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a\r\nfair vote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery be voted\r\ndown or voted up. I do not understand his declaration, that he cares not\r\nwhether slavery be voted down or voted up, to be intended by him other\r\nthan as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public\r\nmind,--the principle for which he declares he has suffered so much, and is\r\nready to suffer to the end. And well may he cling to that principle! If he\r\nhas any parental feeling, well may he cling to it. That principle is the\r\nonly shred left of his original Nebraska doctrine. Under the Dred Scott\r\ndecision \"squatter sovereignty\" squatted out of existence, tumbled down\r\nlike temporary scaffolding; like the mould at the foundry, served through\r\none blast, and fell back into loose sand; helped to carry an election,\r\nand then was kicked to the winds. His late joint struggle with the\r\nRepublicans, against the Lecompton Constitution, involves nothing of the\r\noriginal Nebraska doctrine. That struggle was made on a point--the\r\nright of a people to make their own constitution--upon which he and the\r\nRepublicans have never differed.\r\n\r\nThe several points of the Dred Scott decision, in connection with Senator\r\nDouglas's \"care not\" policy, constitute the piece of machinery, in its\r\npresent state of advancement. This was the third point gained. The working\r\npoints of that machinery are:\r\n\r\nFirstly, That no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no\r\ndescendant of such slave, can ever be a citizen of any State, in the sense\r\nof that term as used in the Constitution of the United States. This point\r\nis made in order to deprive the negro, in every possible event, of the\r\nbenefit of that provision of the United States Constitution which declares\r\nthat \"The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens in the several States.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, That, \"subject to the Constitution of the United States,\"\r\nneither Congress nor a Territorial Legislature can exclude slavery from\r\nany United States Territory. This point is made in order that individual\r\nmen may fill up the Territories with slaves, without danger of losing\r\nthem as property, and thus to enhance the chances of permanency to the\r\ninstitution through all the future.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free\r\nState makes him free, as against the holder, the United States courts will\r\nnot decide, but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave State\r\nthe negro may be forced into by the master. This point is made, not to\r\nbe pressed immediately; but, if acquiesced in for a while, and apparently\r\nindorsed by the people at an election, then to sustain the logical\r\nconclusion that what Dred Scott's master might lawfully do with Dred\r\nScott, in the free State of Illinois, every other master may lawfully do\r\nwith any other one, or one thousand slaves, in Illinois, or in any other\r\nfree State.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it, the Nebraska\r\ndoctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and mould public opinion,\r\nat least Northern public opinion, not to care whether slavery is voted\r\ndown or voted up. This shows exactly where we now are; and partially,\r\nalso, wither we are tending.\r\n\r\nIt will throw additional light on the latter, to go back and run the mind\r\nover the string of historical facts already stated. Several things\r\nwill now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were\r\ntranspiring. The people were to be left \"perfectly free,\" \"subject only\r\nto the Constitution.\" What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders\r\ncould not then see. Plainly enough now,--it was an exactly fitted niche,\r\nfor the Dred Scott decision to afterward come in, and declare the perfect\r\nfreedom of the people to be just no freedom at all. Why was the amendment,\r\nexpressly declaring the right of the people, voted down? Plainly enough\r\nnow,--the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the Dred\r\nScott decision. Why was the court decision held up? Why even a Senator's\r\nindividual opinion withheld, till after the Presidential election? Plainly\r\nenough now,--the speaking out then would have damaged the \"perfectly\r\nfree\" argument upon which the election was to be carried. Why the\r\noutgoing President's felicitation on the indorsement? Why the delay of a\r\nreargument? Why the incoming President's advance exhortation in favor of\r\nthe decision? These things look like the cautious patting and petting of a\r\nspirited horse preparatory to mounting him, when it is dreaded that he may\r\ngive the rider a fall. And why the hasty after-indorsement of the decision\r\nby the President and others?\r\n\r\nWe cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the result\r\nof preconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions\r\nof which we know have been gotten out at different times and places and by\r\ndifferent workmen, Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for instance, and\r\nwhen we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the\r\nframe of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortises exactly fitting,\r\nand all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly\r\nadapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too\r\nfew,--not omitting even scaffolding,--or, if a single piece be lacking, we\r\nsee the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such\r\npiece in,--in such a case, we find it impossible not to believe that\r\nStephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood one another from\r\nthe beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before\r\nthe first blow was struck.\r\n\r\nIt should not be overlooked that by the Nebraska Bill the people of a\r\nState as well as Territory were to be left \"perfectly free,\" \"subject\r\nonly to the Constitution.\" Why mention a State? They were legislating for\r\nTerritories, and not for or about States. Certainly the people of a State\r\nare and ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United States; but\r\nwhy is mention of this lugged into this merely Territorial law? Why\r\nare the people of a Territory and the people of a State therein lumped\r\ntogether, and their relation to the Constitution therefore treated as\r\nbeing precisely the same? While the opinion of the court, by Chief Justice\r\nTaney, in the Dred Scott case, and the separate opinions of all the\r\nconcurring Judges, expressly declare that the Constitution of the United\r\nStates neither permits Congress nor a Territorial Legislature to exclude\r\nslavery from any United States Territory, they all omit to declare whether\r\nor not the same Constitution permits a State, or the people of a State, to\r\nexclude it. Possibly, this is a mere omission; but who can be quite sure,\r\nif McLean or Curtis had sought to get into the opinion a declaration of\r\nunlimited power in the people of a State to exclude slavery from their\r\nlimits, just as Chase and Mace sought to get such declaration, in behalf\r\nof the people of a Territory, into the Nebraska Bill,--I ask, who can be\r\nquite sure that it would not have been voted down in the one case as it\r\nhad been in the other? The nearest approach to the point of declaring the\r\npower of a State over slavery is made by Judge Nelson. He approaches it\r\nmore than once, Using the precise idea, and almost the language, too, of\r\nthe Nebraska Act. On one occasion, his exact language is, \"Except in cases\r\nwhere the power is restrained by the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthe law of the State is supreme over the subject of slavery within its\r\njurisdiction.\" In what cases the power of the States is so restrained by\r\nthe United States Constitution, is left an open question, precisely as the\r\nsame question, as to the restraint on the power of the Territories, was\r\nleft open in the Nebraska Act. Put this and that together, and we have\r\nanother nice little niche, which we may, ere long, see filled with another\r\nSupreme Court decision, declaring that the Constitution of the United\r\nStates does not permit a State to exclude slavery from its limits. And\r\nthis may especially be expected if the doctrine of \"care not whether\r\nslavery be voted down or voted up\" shall gain upon the public mind\r\nsufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained when\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nSuch a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all\r\nthe States. Welcome or unwelcome, such decision is probably coming, and\r\nwill soon be upon us, unless the power of the present political dynasty\r\nshall be met and overthrown. We shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that\r\nthe people of Missouri are on the verge of making their State free, and\r\nwe shall awake to the reality instead that the Supreme Court has made\r\nIllinois a slave State. To meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty is\r\nthe work now before all those who would prevent that consummation. That is\r\nwhat we have to do. How can we best do it?\r\n\r\nThere are those who denounce us openly to their friends, and yet whisper\r\nto us softly that Senator Douglas is the aptest instrument there is with\r\nwhich to effect that object. They wish us to infer all, from the fact that\r\nhe now has a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty, and that\r\nhe has regularly voted with us on a single point, upon which he and we\r\nhave never differed. They remind us that he is a great man, and that the\r\nlargest of us are very small ones. Let this be granted. But \"a living dog\r\nis better than a dead lion.\" Judge Douglas, if not a dead lion, for this\r\nwork is at least a caged and toothless one. How can he oppose the advances\r\nof slavery? He don't care anything about it. His avowed mission is\r\nimpressing the \"public heart\" to care nothing about it. A leading Douglas\r\nDemocratic newspaper thinks Douglas's superior talent will be needed to\r\nresist the revival of the African slave trade. Does Douglas believe an\r\neffort to revive that trade is approaching? He has not said so. Does he\r\nreally think so? But if it is, how can he resist it? For years he has\r\nlabored to prove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves into\r\nthe new Territories. Can he possibly show that it is less a sacred right\r\nto buy them where they can be bought cheapest? And unquestionably they can\r\nbe bought cheaper in Africa than in Virginia. He has done all in his\r\npower to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of\r\nproperty; and, as such, how can he oppose the foreign slave trade, how can\r\nhe refuse that trade in that \"property\" shall be \"perfectly free,\"--unless\r\nhe does it as a protection to the home production? And as the home\r\nproducers will probably not ask the protection, he will be wholly without\r\na ground of opposition.\r\n\r\nSenator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may rightfully be wiser to-day\r\nthan he was yesterday; that he may rightfully change when he finds himself\r\nwrong. But can we, for that reason, run ahead, and infer that he will make\r\nany particular change, of which he himself has given no intimation? Can we\r\nsafely base our action upon any such vague inference? Now, as ever, I wish\r\nnot to misrepresent Judge Douglas's position, question his motives, or do\r\naught that can be personally offensive to him. Whenever, if ever, he and\r\nwe can come together on principle so that our cause may have assistance\r\nfrom his great ability, I hope to have interposed no adventitious\r\nobstacles. But clearly he is not now with us; he does not pretend to\r\nbe,--he does not promise ever to be.\r\n\r\nOur cause, then, must be intrusted to, and conducted by, its own undoubted\r\nfriends,--those whose hands are free, whose hearts are in the work, who do\r\ncare for the result. Two years ago the Republicans of the nation mustered\r\nover thirteen hundred thousand strong. We did this under the single\r\nimpulse of resistance to a common danger, with every external circumstance\r\nagainst us. Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements we gathered\r\nfrom the four winds, and formed and fought the battle through, under the\r\nconstant hot fire of a disciplined, proud, and pampered enemy. Did we\r\nbrave all then to falter now,--now, when that same enemy is wavering,\r\ndissevered, and belligerent? The result is not doubtful. We shall not\r\nfail; if we stand firm, we shall not fail. Wise counsels may accelerate,\r\nor mistakes delay it, but, sooner or later, the victory is sure to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT CHICAGO, JULY 10, 1858.\r\n\r\nIN REPLY TO SENATOR DOUGLAS\r\n\r\nDELIVERED AT CHICAGO, SATURDAY EVENING, JULY 10, 1858.\r\n\r\n(Mr. DOUGLAS WAS NOT PRESENT.)\r\n\r\n[Mr. LINCOLN was introduced by C. L. Wilson, Esq., and as he made his\r\nappearance he was greeted with a perfect storm of applause. For some\r\nmoments the enthusiasm continued unabated. At last, when by a wave of his\r\nhand partial silence was restored, Mr. LINCOLN said,]\r\n\r\nMY FELLOW-CITIZENS:--On yesterday evening, upon the occasion of the\r\nreception given to Senator Douglas, I was furnished with a seat very\r\nconvenient for hearing him, and was otherwise very courteously treated by\r\nhim and his friends, and for which I thank him and them. During the course\r\nof his remarks my name was mentioned in such a way as, I suppose, renders\r\nit at least not improper that I should make some sort of reply to him. I\r\nshall not attempt to follow him in the precise order in which he addressed\r\nthe assembled multitude upon that occasion, though I shall perhaps do so\r\nin the main.\r\n\r\nThere was one question to which he asked the attention of the crowd, which\r\nI deem of somewhat less importance--at least of propriety--for me to dwell\r\nupon than the others, which he brought in near the close of his speech,\r\nand which I think it would not be entirely proper for me to omit attending\r\nto, and yet if I were not to give some attention to it now, I should\r\nprobably forget it altogether. While I am upon this subject, allow me to\r\nsay that I do not intend to indulge in that inconvenient mode sometimes\r\nadopted in public speaking, of reading from documents; but I shall depart\r\nfrom that rule so far as to read a little scrap from his speech, which\r\nnotices this first topic of which I shall speak,--that is, provided I can\r\nfind it in the paper:\r\n\r\n\"I have made up my mind to appeal to the people against the combination\r\nthat has been made against me; the Republican leaders having formed an\r\nalliance, an unholy and unnatural alliance, with a portion of unscrupulous\r\nFederal office-holders. I intend to fight that allied army wherever I meet\r\nthem. I know they deny the alliance; but yet these men who are trying\r\nto divide the Democratic party for the purpose of electing a Republican\r\nSenator in my place are just as much the agents and tools of the\r\nsupporters of Mr. Lincoln. Hence I shall deal with this allied army\r\njust as the Russians dealt with the Allies at Sebastopol,--that is, the\r\nRussians did not stop to inquire, when they fired a broadside, whether it\r\nhit an Englishman, a Frenchman, or a Turk. Nor will I stop to inquire,\r\nnor shall I hesitate, whether my blows shall hit the Republican leaders\r\nor their allies, who are holding the Federal offices, and yet acting in\r\nconcert with them.\"\r\n\r\nWell, now, gentlemen, is not that very alarming? Just to think of it!\r\nright at the outset of his canvass, I, a poor, kind, amiable, intelligent\r\ngentleman,--I am to be slain in this way! Why, my friend the Judge is not\r\nonly, as it turns out, not a dead lion, nor even a living one,--he is the\r\nrugged Russian Bear!\r\n\r\nBut if they will have it--for he says that we deny it--that there is any\r\nsuch alliance, as he says there is,--and I don't propose hanging very much\r\nupon this question of veracity,--but if he will have it that there is such\r\nan alliance, that the Administration men and we are allied, and we stand\r\nin the attitude of English, French, and Turk, he occupying the position\r\nof the Russian, in that case I beg that he will indulge us while we barely\r\nsuggest to him that these allies took Sebastopol.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, only a few more words as to this alliance. For my part, I have\r\nto say that whether there be such an alliance depends, so far as I know,\r\nupon what may be a right definition of the term alliance. If for the\r\nRepublican party to see the other great party to which they are opposed\r\ndivided among themselves, and not try to stop the division, and rather be\r\nglad of it,--if that is an alliance, I confess I am in; but if it is meant\r\nto be said that the Republicans had formed an alliance going beyond that,\r\nby which there is contribution of money or sacrifice of principle on the\r\none side or the other, so far as the Republican party is concerned,--if\r\nthere be any such thing, I protest that I neither know anything of it,\r\nnor do I believe it. I will, however, say,--as I think this branch of the\r\nargument is lugged in,--I would before I leave it state, for the benefit\r\nof those concerned, that one of those same Buchanan men did once tell me\r\nof an argument that he made for his opposition to Judge Douglas. He said\r\nthat a friend of our Senator Douglas had been talking to him, and had,\r\namong other things, said to him:\r\n\r\n\"...why, you don't want to beat Douglas?\" \"Yes,\" said he, \"I do want to\r\nbeat him, and I will tell you why. I believe his original Nebraska Bill\r\nwas right in the abstract, but it was wrong in the time that it was\r\nbrought forward. It was wrong in the application to a Territory in regard\r\nto which the question had been settled; it was brought forward at a time\r\nwhen nobody asked him; it was tendered to the South when the South had not\r\nasked for it, but when they could not well refuse it; and for this same\r\nreason he forced that question upon our party. It has sunk the best men\r\nall over the nation, everywhere; and now, when our President, struggling\r\nwith the difficulties of this man's getting up, has reached the very\r\nhardest point to turn in the case, he deserts him and I am for putting him\r\nwhere he will trouble us no more.\"\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, that is not my argument; that is not my argument at all.\r\nI have only been stating to you the argument of a Buchanan man. You will\r\njudge if there is any force in it.\r\n\r\nPopular sovereignty! Everlasting popular sovereignty! Let us for a moment\r\ninquire into this vast matter of popular sovereignty. What is popular\r\nsovereignty? We recollect that at an early period in the history of\r\nthis struggle there was another name for the same thing,--\"squatter\r\nsovereignty.\" It was not exactly popular sovereignty, but squatter\r\nsovereignty. What do those terms mean? What do those terms mean when used\r\nnow? And vast credit is taken by our friend the Judge in regard to his\r\nsupport of it, when he declares the last years of his life have been,\r\nand all the future years of his life shall be, devoted to this matter of\r\npopular sovereignty. What is it? Why, it is the sovereignty of the people!\r\nWhat was squatter sovereignty? I suppose, if it had any significance at\r\nall, it was the right of the people to govern themselves, to be sovereign\r\nin their own affairs while they were squatted down in a country not their\r\nown, while they had squatted on a Territory that did not belong to them,\r\nin the sense that a State belongs to the people who inhabit it, when\r\nit belonged to the nation; such right to govern themselves was called\r\n\"squatter sovereignty.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I wish you to mark: What has become of that squatter sovereignty?\r\nwhat has become of it? Can you get anybody to tell you now that the people\r\nof a Territory have any authority to govern themselves, in regard to this\r\nmooted question of slavery, before they form a State constitution? No such\r\nthing at all; although there is a general running fire, and although there\r\nhas been a hurrah made in every speech on that side, assuming that policy\r\nhad given the people of a Territory the right to govern themselves upon\r\nthis question, yet the point is dodged. To-day it has been decided--no\r\nmore than a year ago it was decided--by the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, and is insisted upon to-day that the people of a Territory have no\r\nright to exclude slavery from a Territory; that if any one man chooses to\r\ntake slaves into a Territory, all the rest of the people have no right\r\nto keep them out. This being so, and this decision being made one of the\r\npoints that the Judge approved, and one in the approval of which he says\r\nhe means to keep me down,--put me down I should not say, for I have never\r\nbeen up,--he says he is in favor of it, and sticks to it, and expects to\r\nwin his battle on that decision, which says that there is no such thing\r\nas squatter sovereignty, but that any one man may take slaves into a\r\nTerritory, and all the other men in the Territory may be opposed to it,\r\nand yet by reason of the Constitution they cannot prohibit it. When that\r\nis so, how much is left of this vast matter of squatter sovereignty, I\r\nshould like to know?\r\n\r\nWhen we get back, we get to the point of the right of the people to make a\r\nconstitution. Kansas was settled, for example, in 1854. It was a Territory\r\nyet, without having formed a constitution, in a very regular way, for\r\nthree years. All this time negro slavery could be taken in by any few\r\nindividuals, and by that decision of the Supreme Court, which the Judge\r\napproves, all the rest of the people cannot keep it out; but when they\r\ncome to make a constitution, they may say they will not have slavery. But\r\nit is there; they are obliged to tolerate it some way, and all experience\r\nshows it will be so, for they will not take the negro slaves and\r\nabsolutely deprive the owners of them. All experience shows this to be so.\r\nAll that space of time that runs from the beginning of the settlement\r\nof the Territory until there is sufficiency of people to make a State\r\nconstitution,--all that portion of time popular sovereignty is given up.\r\nThe seal is absolutely put down upon it by the court decision, and Judge\r\nDouglas puts his own upon the top of that; yet he is appealing to the\r\npeople to give him vast credit for his devotion to popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\nAgain, when we get to the question of the right of the people to form\r\na State constitution as they please, to form it with slavery or without\r\nslavery, if that is anything new, I confess I don't know it. Has there\r\never been a time when anybody said that any other than the people of a\r\nTerritory itself should form a constitution? What is now in it that Judge\r\nDouglas should have fought several years of his life, and pledge himself\r\nto fight all the remaining years of his life for? Can Judge Douglas find\r\nanybody on earth that said that anybody else should form a constitution\r\nfor a people? [A voice, \"Yes.\"] Well, I should like you to name him; I\r\nshould like to know who he was. [Same voice, \"John Calhoun.\"]\r\n\r\nNo, sir, I never heard of even John Calhoun saying such a thing. He\r\ninsisted on the same principle as Judge Douglas; but his mode of applying\r\nit, in fact, was wrong. It is enough for my purpose to ask this crowd\r\nwhenever a Republican said anything against it. They never said anything\r\nagainst it, but they have constantly spoken for it; and whoever will\r\nundertake to examine the platform, and the speeches of responsible men of\r\nthe party, and of irresponsible men, too, if you please, will be unable to\r\nfind one word from anybody in the Republican ranks opposed to that popular\r\nsovereignty which Judge Douglas thinks that he has invented. I suppose\r\nthat Judge Douglas will claim, in a little while, that he is the inventor\r\nof the idea that the people should govern themselves; that nobody ever\r\nthought of such a thing until he brought it forward. We do not remember\r\nthat in that old Declaration of Independence it is said that:\r\n\r\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal;\r\nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights;\r\nthat among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to\r\nsecure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their\r\njust powers from the consent of the governed.\"\r\n\r\nThere is the origin of popular sovereignty. Who, then, shall come in at\r\nthis day and claim that he invented it?\r\n\r\nThe Lecompton Constitution connects itself with this question, for it is\r\nin this matter of the Lecompton Constitution that our friend Judge\r\nDouglas claims such vast credit. I agree that in opposing the Lecompton\r\nConstitution, so far as I can perceive, he was right. I do not deny that\r\nat all; and, gentlemen, you will readily see why I could not deny it,\r\neven if I wanted to. But I do not wish to; for all the Republicans in the\r\nnation opposed it, and they would have opposed it just as much without\r\nJudge Douglas's aid as with it. They had all taken ground against it long\r\nbefore he did. Why, the reason that he urges against that constitution I\r\nurged against him a year before. I have the printed speech in my hand. The\r\nargument that he makes, why that constitution should not be adopted, that\r\nthe people were not fairly represented nor allowed to vote, I pointed out\r\nin a speech a year ago, which I hold in my hand now, that no fair chance\r\nwas to be given to the people. [\"Read it, Read it.\"] I shall not waste\r\nyour time by trying to read it. [\"Read it, Read it.\"] Gentlemen, reading\r\nfrom speeches is a very tedious business, particularly for an old man that\r\nhas to put on spectacles, and more so if the man be so tall that he has to\r\nbend over to the light.\r\n\r\nA little more, now, as to this matter of popular sovereignty and the\r\nLecompton Constitution. The Lecompton Constitution, as the Judge tells us,\r\nwas defeated. The defeat of it was a good thing or it was not. He thinks\r\nthe defeat of it was a good thing, and so do I, and we agree in that. Who\r\ndefeated it?\r\n\r\n[A voice: Judge Douglas.]\r\n\r\nYes, he furnished himself, and if you suppose he controlled the other\r\nDemocrats that went with him, he furnished three votes; while the\r\nRepublicans furnished twenty.\r\n\r\nThat is what he did to defeat it. In the House of Representatives he and\r\nhis friends furnished some twenty votes, and the Republicans furnished\r\nninety odd. Now, who was it that did the work?\r\n\r\n[A voice: Douglas.]\r\n\r\nWhy, yes, Douglas did it! To be sure he did.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, put that proposition another way. The Republicans could\r\nnot have done it without Judge Douglas. Could he have done it without\r\nthem? Which could have come the nearest to doing it without the other?\r\n\r\n[A voice: Who killed the bill?]\r\n\r\n[Another voice: Douglas.]\r\n\r\nGround was taken against it by the Republicans long before Douglas did it.\r\nThe proportion of opposition to that measure is about five to one.\r\n\r\n[A voice: Why don't they come out on it?]\r\n\r\nYou don't know what you are talking about, my friend. I am quite willing\r\nto answer any gentleman in the crowd who asks an intelligent question.\r\n\r\nNow, who in all this country has ever found any of our friends of Judge\r\nDouglas's way of thinking, and who have acted upon this main question,\r\nthat has ever thought of uttering a word in behalf of Judge Trumbull?\r\n\r\n[A voice: We have.]\r\n\r\nI defy you to show a printed resolution passed in a Democratic meeting--I\r\ntake it upon myself to defy any man to show a printed resolution of a\r\nDemocratic meeting, large or small--in favor of Judge Trumbull, or any of\r\nthe five to one Republicans who beat that bill. Everything must be for the\r\nDemocrats! They did everything, and the five to the one that really did\r\nthe thing they snub over, and they do not seem to remember that they have\r\nan existence upon the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I fear that I shall become tedious. I leave this branch of the\r\nsubject to take hold of another. I take up that part of Judge Douglas's\r\nspeech in which he respectfully attended to me.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas made two points upon my recent speech at Springfield. He\r\nsays they are to be the issues of this campaign. The first one of these\r\npoints he bases upon the language in a speech which I delivered at\r\nSpringfield, which I believe I can quote correctly from memory. I\r\nsaid there that \"we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was\r\ninstituted for the avowed object, and with the confident promise, of\r\nputting an end to slavery agitation; under the operation of that policy,\r\nthat agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented.\"\r\n\"I believe it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and\r\npassed. 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this\r\ngovernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.\" \"I do not\r\nexpect the Union to be dissolved,\"--I am quoting from my speech, \"--I do\r\nnot expect the house to fall, but I do expect it will cease to be divided.\r\nIt will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of\r\nslavery will arrest the spread of it and place it where the public mind\r\nshall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction,\r\nor its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful\r\nin all the States, north as well as south.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the paragraph? In this paragraph, which I have quoted in your\r\nhearing, and to which I ask the attention of all, Judge Douglas thinks he\r\ndiscovers great political heresy. I want your attention particularly to\r\nwhat he has inferred from it. He says I am in favor of making all the\r\nStates of this Union uniform in all their internal regulations; that in\r\nall their domestic concerns I am in favor of making them entirely uniform.\r\nHe draws this inference from the language I have quoted to you. He says\r\nthat I am in favor of making war by the North upon the South for the\r\nextinction of slavery; that I am also in favor of inviting (as he\r\nexpresses it) the South to a war upon the North for the purpose of\r\nnationalizing slavery. Now, it is singular enough, if you will carefully\r\nread that passage over, that I did not say that I was in favor of anything\r\nin it. I only said what I expected would take place. I made a prediction\r\nonly,--it may have been a foolish one, perhaps. I did not even say that I\r\ndesired that slavery should be put in course of ultimate extinction. I do\r\nsay so now, however, so there need be no longer any difficulty about that.\r\nIt may be written down in the great speech.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, Judge Douglas informed you that this speech of mine was\r\nprobably carefully prepared. I admit that it was. I am not master of\r\nlanguage; I have not a fine education; I am not capable of entering into\r\na disquisition upon dialectics, as I believe you call it; but I do not\r\nbelieve the language I employed bears any such construction as Judge\r\nDouglas puts upon it. But I don't care about a quibble in regard to words.\r\nI know what I meant, and I will not leave this crowd in doubt, if I can\r\nexplain it to them, what I really meant in the use of that paragraph.\r\n\r\nI am not, in the first place, unaware that this government has endured\r\neighty-two years half slave and half free. I know that. I am tolerably\r\nwell acquainted with the history of the country, and I know that it has\r\nendured eighty-two years half slave and half free. I believe--and that is\r\nwhat I meant to allude to there--I believe it has endured because during\r\nall that time, until the introduction of the Nebraska Bill, the public\r\nmind did rest all the time in the belief that slavery was in course of\r\nultimate extinction. That was what gave us the rest that we had through\r\nthat period of eighty-two years,--at least, so I believe. I have always\r\nhated slavery, I think, as much as any Abolitionist,--I have been an Old\r\nLine Whig,--I have always hated it; but I have always been quiet about\r\nit until this new era of the introduction of the Nebraska Bill began. I\r\nalways believed that everybody was against it, and that it was in course\r\nof ultimate extinction. [Pointing to Mr. Browning, who stood near by.]\r\nBrowning thought so; the great mass of the nation have rested in the\r\nbelief that slavery was in course of ultimate extinction. They had reason\r\nso to believe.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Constitution and its attendant history led the\r\npeople to believe so; and that such was the belief of the framers of the\r\nConstitution itself, why did those old men, about the time of the adoption\r\nof the Constitution, decree that slavery should not go into the new\r\nTerritory, where it had not already gone? Why declare that within twenty\r\nyears the African slave trade, by which slaves are supplied, might be cut\r\noff by Congress? Why were all these acts? I might enumerate more of these\r\nacts; but enough. What were they but a clear indication that the framers\r\nof the Constitution intended and expected the ultimate extinction of\r\nthat institution? And now, when I say, as I said in my speech that Judge\r\nDouglas has quoted from, when I say that I think the opponents of slavery\r\nwill resist the farther spread of it, and place it where the public mind\r\nshall rest with the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction,\r\nI only mean to say that they will place it where the founders of this\r\ngovernment originally placed it.\r\n\r\nI have said a hundred times, and I have now no inclination to take it\r\nback, that I believe there is no right, and ought to be no inclination, in\r\nthe people of the free States to enter into the slave States and interfere\r\nwith the question of slavery at all. I have said that always; Judge\r\nDouglas has heard me say it, if not quite a hundred times, at least\r\nas good as a hundred times; and when it is said that I am in favor of\r\ninterfering with slavery where it exists, I know it is unwarranted by\r\nanything I have ever intended, and, as I believe, by anything I have ever\r\nsaid. If, by any means, I have ever used language which could fairly be so\r\nconstrued (as, however, I believe I never have), I now correct it.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the inference that Judge Douglas draws, that I am in\r\nfavor of setting the sections at war with one another. I know that I never\r\nmeant any such thing, and I believe that no fair mind can infer any such\r\nthing from anything I have ever said.\r\n\r\nNow, in relation to his inference that I am in favor of a general\r\nconsolidation of all the local institutions of the various States. I will\r\nattend to that for a little while, and try to inquire, if I can, how on\r\nearth it could be that any man could draw such an inference from anything\r\nI said. I have said, very many times, in Judge Douglas's hearing, that no\r\nman believed more than I in the principle of self-government; that it lies\r\nat the bottom of all my ideas of just government, from beginning to end. I\r\nhave denied that his use of that term applies properly. But for the thing\r\nitself, I deny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in his devotion to\r\nthe principle, whatever he may have done in efficiency in advocating it. I\r\nthink that I have said it in your hearing, that I believe each individual\r\nis naturally entitled to do as he pleases with himself and the fruit of\r\nhis labor, so far as it in no wise interferes with any other man's rights;\r\nthat each community as a State has a right to do exactly as it pleases\r\nwith all the concerns within that State that interfere with the right of\r\nno other State; and that the General Government, upon principle, has no\r\nright to interfere with anything other than that general class of things\r\nthat does concern the whole. I have said that at all times. I have said,\r\nas illustrations, that I do not believe in the right of Illinois to\r\ninterfere with the cranberry laws of Indiana, the oyster laws of Virginia,\r\nor the liquor laws of Maine. I have said these things over and over again,\r\nand I repeat them here as my sentiments.\r\n\r\nHow is it, then, that Judge Douglas infers, because I hope to see slavery\r\nput where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the\r\ncourse of ultimate extinction, that I am in favor of Illinois going over\r\nand interfering with the cranberry laws of Indiana? What can authorize him\r\nto draw any such inference?\r\n\r\nI suppose there might be one thing that at least enabled him to draw\r\nsuch an inference that would not be true with me or many others: that is,\r\nbecause he looks upon all this matter of slavery as an exceedingly little\r\nthing,--this matter of keeping one sixth of the population of the whole\r\nnation in a state of oppression and tyranny unequaled in the world. He\r\nlooks upon it as being an exceedingly little thing,--only equal to the\r\nquestion of the cranberry laws of Indiana; as something having no moral\r\nquestion in it; as something on a par with the question of whether a man\r\nshall pasture his land with cattle, or plant it with tobacco; so little\r\nand so small a thing that he concludes, if I could desire that anything\r\nshould be done to bring about the ultimate extinction of that little\r\nthing, I must be in favor of bringing about an amalgamation of all\r\nthe other little things in the Union. Now, it so happens--and there, I\r\npresume, is the foundation of this mistake--that the Judge thinks thus;\r\nand it so happens that there is a vast portion of the American people that\r\ndo not look upon that matter as being this very little thing. They look\r\nupon it as a vast moral evil; they can prove it as such by the writings of\r\nthose who gave us the blessings of liberty which we enjoy, and that they\r\nso looked upon it, and not as an evil merely confining itself to the\r\nStates where it is situated; and while we agree that, by the Constitution\r\nwe assented to, in the States where it exists, we have no right to\r\ninterfere with it, because it is in the Constitution; and we are by both\r\nduty and inclination to stick by that Constitution, in all its letter and\r\nspirit, from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, as to my disposition--my wish to have all the State\r\nlegislatures blotted out, and to have one consolidated government, and a\r\nuniformity of domestic regulations in all the States, by which I suppose\r\nit is meant, if we raise corn here, we must make sugar-cane grow here\r\ntoo, and we must make those which grow North grow in the South. All this\r\nI suppose he understands I am in favor of doing. Now, so much for all this\r\nnonsense; for I must call it so. The Judge can have no issue with me on\r\na question of establishing uniformity in the domestic regulations of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA little now on the other point,--the Dred Scott decision. Another of the\r\nissues he says that is to be made with me is upon his devotion to the Dred\r\nScott decision, and my opposition to it.\r\n\r\nI have expressed heretofore, and I now repeat, my opposition to the\r\nDred Scott decision; but I should be allowed to state the nature of\r\nthat opposition, and I ask your indulgence while I do so. What is fairly\r\nimplied by the term Judge Douglas has used, \"resistance to the decision\"?\r\nI do not resist it. If I wanted to take Dred Scott from his master, I\r\nwould be interfering with property, and that terrible difficulty that\r\nJudge Douglas speaks of, of interfering with property, would arise. But\r\nI am doing no such thing as that, but all that I am doing is refusing to\r\nobey it as a political rule. If I were in Congress, and a vote should come\r\nup on a question whether slavery should be prohibited in a new Territory,\r\nin spite of the Dred Scott decision, I would vote that it should.\r\n\r\nThat is what I should do. Judge Douglas said last night that before the\r\ndecision he might advance his opinion, and it might be contrary to the\r\ndecision when it was made; but after it was made he would abide by\r\nit until it was reversed. Just so! We let this property abide by the\r\ndecision, but we will try to reverse that decision. We will try to put it\r\nwhere Judge Douglas would not object, for he says he will obey it until it\r\nis reversed. Somebody has to reverse that decision, since it is made, and\r\nwe mean to reverse it, and we mean to do it peaceably.\r\n\r\nWhat are the uses of decisions of courts? They have two uses. As rules of\r\nproperty they have two uses. First, they decide upon the question before\r\nthe court. They decide in this case that Dred Scott is a slave. Nobody\r\nresists that, not only that, but they say to everybody else that persons\r\nstanding just as Dred Scott stands are as he is. That is, they say that\r\nwhen a question comes up upon another person, it will be so decided again,\r\nunless the court decides in another way, unless the court overrules its\r\ndecision. Well, we mean to do what we can to have the court decide the\r\nother way. That is one thing we mean to try to do.\r\n\r\nThe sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this decision is a degree\r\nof sacredness that has never been before thrown around any other decision.\r\nI have never heard of such a thing. Why, decisions apparently contrary\r\nto that decision, or that good lawyers thought were contrary to that\r\ndecision, have been made by that very court before. It is the first of\r\nits kind; it is an astonisher in legal history. It is a new wonder of the\r\nworld. It is based upon falsehood in the main as to the facts; allegations\r\nof facts upon which it stands are not facts at all in many instances, and\r\nno decision made on any question--the first instance of a decision made\r\nunder so many unfavorable circumstances--thus placed, has ever been held\r\nby the profession as law, and it has always needed confirmation before the\r\nlawyers regarded it as settled law. But Judge Douglas will have it\r\nthat all hands must take this extraordinary decision, made under these\r\nextraordinary circumstances, and give their vote in Congress in accordance\r\nwith it, yield to it, and obey it in every possible sense. Circumstances\r\nalter cases. Do not gentlemen here remember the case of that same Supreme\r\nCourt some twenty-five or thirty years ago deciding that a National Bank\r\nwas constitutional? I ask, if somebody does not remember that a National\r\nBank was declared to be constitutional? Such is the truth, whether it be\r\nremembered or not. The Bank charter ran out, and a recharter was granted\r\nby Congress. That recharter was laid before General Jackson. It was urged\r\nupon him, when he denied the constitutionality of the Bank, that the\r\nSupreme Court had decided that it was constitutional; and General Jackson\r\nthen said that the Supreme Court had no right to lay down a rule to govern\r\na coordinate branch of the government, the members of which had sworn\r\nto support the Constitution; that each member had sworn to support that\r\nConstitution as he understood it. I will venture here to say that I have\r\nheard Judge Douglas say that he approved of General Jackson for that act.\r\nWhat has now become of all his tirade about \"resistance of the Supreme\r\nCourt\"?\r\n\r\nMy fellow-citizens, getting back a little,--for I pass from these\r\npoints,--when Judge Douglas makes his threat of annihilation upon the\r\n\"alliance,\" he is cautious to say that that warfare of his is to fall\r\nupon the leaders of the Republican party. Almost every word he utters,\r\nand every distinction he makes, has its significance. He means for the\r\nRepublicans who do not count themselves as leaders, to be his friends; he\r\nmakes no fuss over them; it is the leaders that he is making war upon. He\r\nwants it understood that the mass of the Republican party are really\r\nhis friends. It is only the leaders that are doing something that are\r\nintolerant, and that require extermination at his hands. As this is dearly\r\nand unquestionably the light in which he presents that matter, I want to\r\nask your attention, addressing myself to the Republicans here, that I may\r\nask you some questions as to where you, as the Republican party, would\r\nbe placed if you sustained Judge Douglas in his present position by a\r\nre-election? I do not claim, gentlemen, to be unselfish; I do not pretend\r\nthat I would not like to go to the United States Senate,--I make no such\r\nhypocritical pretense; but I do say to you that in this mighty issue it is\r\nnothing to you--nothing to the mass of the people of the nation,--whether\r\nor not Judge Douglas or myself shall ever be heard of after this night;\r\nit may be a trifle to either of us, but in connection with this mighty\r\nquestion, upon which hang the destinies of the nation, perhaps, it is\r\nabsolutely nothing: but where will you be placed if you reindorse Judge\r\nDouglas? Don't you know how apt he is, how exceedingly anxious he is at\r\nall times, to seize upon anything and everything to persuade you that\r\nsomething he has done you did yourselves? Why, he tried to persuade you\r\nlast night that our Illinois Legislature instructed him to introduce the\r\nNebraska Bill. There was nobody in that Legislature ever thought of such a\r\nthing; and when he first introduced the bill, he never thought of it; but\r\nstill he fights furiously for the proposition, and that he did it because\r\nthere was a standing instruction to our Senators to be always introducing\r\nNebraska bills. He tells you he is for the Cincinnati platform, he tells\r\nyou he is for the Dred Scott decision. He tells you, not in his speech\r\nlast night, but substantially in a former speech, that he cares not if\r\nslavery is voted up or down; he tells you the struggle on Lecompton is\r\npast; it may come up again or not, and if it does, he stands where\r\nhe stood when, in spite of him and his opposition, you built up the\r\nRepublican party. If you indorse him, you tell him you do not care whether\r\nslavery be voted up or down, and he will close or try to close your mouths\r\nwith his declaration, repeated by the day, the week, the month, and the\r\nyear. Is that what you mean? [Cries of \"No,\" one voice \"Yes.\"] Yes, I have\r\nno doubt you who have always been for him, if you mean that. No doubt of\r\nthat, soberly I have said, and I repeat it. I think, in the position in\r\nwhich Judge Douglas stood in opposing the Lecompton Constitution, he was\r\nright; he does not know that it will return, but if it does we may know\r\nwhere to find him, and if it does not, we may know where to look for him,\r\nand that is on the Cincinnati platform. Now, I could ask the Republican\r\nparty, after all the hard names that Judge Douglas has called them by all\r\nhis repeated charges of their inclination to marry with and hug negroes;\r\nall his declarations of Black Republicanism,--by the way, we are\r\nimproving, the black has got rubbed off,--but with all that, if he be\r\nindorsed by Republican votes, where do you stand? Plainly, you stand ready\r\nsaddled, bridled, and harnessed, and waiting to be driven over to the\r\nslavery extension camp of the nation,--just ready to be driven over, tied\r\ntogether in a lot, to be driven over, every man with a rope around his\r\nneck, that halter being held by Judge Douglas. That is the question. If\r\nRepublican men have been in earnest in what they have done, I think they\r\nhad better not do it; but I think that the Republican party is made up\r\nof those who, as far as they can peaceably, will oppose the extension of\r\nslavery, and who will hope for its ultimate extinction. If they believe\r\nit is wrong in grasping up the new lands of the continent and keeping them\r\nfrom the settlement of free white laborers, who want the land to bring\r\nup their families upon; if they are in earnest, although they may make a\r\nmistake, they will grow restless, and the time will come when they will\r\ncome back again and reorganize, if not by the same name, at least upon the\r\nsame principles as their party now has. It is better, then, to save the\r\nwork while it is begun. You have done the labor; maintain it, keep it.\r\nIf men choose to serve you, go with them; but as you have made up your\r\norganization upon principle, stand by it; for, as surely as God reigns\r\nover you, and has inspired your mind, and given you a sense of propriety,\r\nand continues to give you hope, so surely will you still cling to these\r\nideas, and you will at last come back again after your wanderings, merely\r\nto do your work over again.\r\n\r\nWe were often,--more than once, at least,--in the course of Judge\r\nDouglas's speech last night, reminded that this government was made for\r\nwhite men; that he believed it was made for white men. Well, that is\r\nputting it into a shape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge\r\nthen goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not warranted.\r\nI protest, now and forever, against that counterfeit logic which presumes\r\nthat because I did not want a negro woman for a slave, I do necessarily\r\nwant her for a wife. My understanding is that I need not have her for\r\neither, but, as God made us separate, we can leave one another alone, and\r\ndo one another much good thereby. There are white men enough to marry all\r\nthe white women, and enough black men to marry all the black women; and in\r\nGod's name let them be so married. The Judge regales us with the terrible\r\nenormities that take place by the mixture of races; that the inferior race\r\nbears the superior down. Why, Judge, if we do not let them get together in\r\nthe Territories, they won't mix there.\r\n\r\n[A voice: \"Three cheers for Lincoln\".--The cheers were given with a hearty\r\ngood-will.]\r\n\r\nI should say at least that that is a self-evident truth.\r\n\r\nNow, it happens that we meet together once every year, sometimes about\r\nthe 4th of July, for some reason or other. These 4th of July gatherings\r\nI suppose have their uses. If you will indulge me, I will state what I\r\nsuppose to be some of them.\r\n\r\nWe are now a mighty nation; we are thirty or about thirty millions of\r\npeople, and we own and inhabit about one fifteenth part of the dry land\r\nof the whole earth. We run our memory back over the pages of history for\r\nabout eighty-two years, and we discover that we were then a very small\r\npeople in point of numbers, vastly inferior to what we are now, with a\r\nvastly less extent of country, with vastly less of everything we deem\r\ndesirable among men; we look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous\r\nto us and to our posterity, and we fix upon something that happened\r\naway back, as in some way or other being connected with this rise of\r\nprosperity. We find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as\r\nour fathers and grandfathers; they were iron men; they fought for the\r\nprinciple that they were contending for; and we understood that by what\r\nthey then did it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we now\r\nenjoy has come to us. We hold this annual celebration to remind ourselves\r\nof all the good done in this process of time, of how it was done and who\r\ndid it, and how we are historically connected with it; and we go from\r\nthese meetings in better humor with ourselves, we feel more attached the\r\none to the other, and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit. In\r\nevery way we are better men in the age and race and country in which we\r\nlive, for these celebrations. But after we have done all this we have\r\nnot yet reached the whole. There is something else connected with it. We\r\nhave--besides these, men descended by blood from our ancestors--among us\r\nperhaps half our people who are not descendants at all of these men;\r\nthey are men who have come from Europe, German, Irish, French, and\r\nScandinavian,--men that have come from Europe themselves, or whose\r\nancestors have come hither and settled here, finding themselves our equals\r\nin all things. If they look back through this history to trace their\r\nconnection with those days by blood, they find they have none, they cannot\r\ncarry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel\r\nthat they are part of us; but when they look through that old Declaration\r\nof Independence, they find that those old men say that \"We hold these\r\ntruths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal\"; and then\r\nthey feel that that moral sentiment, taught in that day, evidences their\r\nrelation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in\r\nthem, and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of\r\nthe blood, and flesh of the flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration;\r\nand so they are. That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links\r\nthe hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link\r\nthose patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds\r\nof men throughout the world.\r\n\r\nNow, sirs, for the purpose of squaring things with this idea of \"don't\r\ncare if slavery is voted up or voted down,\" for sustaining the Dred Scott\r\ndecision, for holding that the Declaration of Independence did not mean\r\nanything at all, we have Judge Douglas giving his exposition of what the\r\nDeclaration of Independence means, and we have him saying that the\r\npeople of America are equal to the people of England. According to his\r\nconstruction, you Germans are not connected with it. Now, I ask you in all\r\nsoberness if all these things, if indulged in, if ratified, if confirmed\r\nand indorsed, if taught to our children, and repeated to them, do not tend\r\nto rub out the sentiment of liberty in the country, and to transform this\r\ngovernment into a government of some other form. Those arguments that are\r\nmade, that the inferior race are to be treated with as much allowance as\r\nthey are capable of enjoying; that as much is to be done for them as their\r\ncondition will allow,--what are these arguments? They are the arguments\r\nthat kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world.\r\nYou will find that all the arguments in favor of kingcraft were of this\r\nclass; they always bestrode the necks of the people not that they wanted\r\nto do it, but because the people were better off for being ridden. That\r\nis their argument, and this argument of the Judge is the same old serpent\r\nthat says, You work, and I eat; you toil, and I will enjoy the fruits of\r\nit. Turn in whatever way you will, whether it come from the mouth of a\r\nking, an excuse for enslaving the people of his country, or from the mouth\r\nof men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another race, it\r\nis all the same old serpent; and I hold, if that course of argumentation\r\nthat is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind that we should\r\nnot care about this should be granted, it does not stop with the negro. I\r\nshould like to know, if taking this old Declaration of Independence, which\r\ndeclares that all men are equal upon principle, and making exceptions to\r\nit, where will it stop? If one man says it does not mean a negro, why not\r\nanother say it does not mean some other man? If that Declaration is not\r\nthe truth, let us get the statute book, in which we find it, and tear it\r\nout! Who is so bold as to do it? If it is not true, let us tear it out!\r\n[Cries of \"No, no.\"] Let us stick to it, then; let us stand firmly by it,\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities\r\nand impose them upon us; and to the extent that a necessity is imposed\r\nupon a man, he must submit to it. I think that was the condition in which\r\nwe found ourselves when we established this government. We had slavery\r\namong us, we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted them\r\nto remain in slavery, we could not secure the good we did secure if we\r\ngrasped for more; and having by necessity submitted to that much, it does\r\nnot destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties. Let that\r\ncharter stand as our standard.\r\n\r\nMy friend has said to me that I am a poor hand to quote Scripture. I will\r\ntry it again, however. It is said in one of the admonitions of our Lord,\r\n\"As your Father in heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect.\" The Savior, I\r\nsuppose, did not expect that any human creature could be perfect as the\r\nFather in heaven; but he said, \"As your Father in heaven is perfect, be ye\r\nalso perfect.\" He set that up as a standard; and he who did most towards\r\nreaching that standard attained the highest degree of moral perfection. So\r\nI say in relation to the principle that all men are created equal, let\r\nit be as nearly reached as we can. If we cannot give freedom to every\r\ncreature, let us do nothing that will impose slavery upon any other\r\ncreature. Let us then turn this government back into the channel in which\r\nthe framers of the Constitution originally placed it. Let us stand\r\nfirmly by each other. If we do not do so, we are turning in the contrary\r\ndirection, that our friend Judge Douglas proposes--not intentionally--as\r\nworking in the traces tends to make this one universal slave nation. He is\r\none that runs in that direction, and as such I resist him.\r\n\r\nMy friends, I have detained you about as long as I desired to do, and I\r\nhave only to say: Let us discard all this quibbling about this man and the\r\nother man, this race and that race and the other race being inferior,\r\nand therefore they must be placed in an inferior position; discarding our\r\nstandard that we have left us. Let us discard all these things, and unite\r\nas one people throughout this land, until we shall once more stand up\r\ndeclaring that all men are created equal.\r\n\r\nMy friends, I could not, without launching off upon some new topic, which\r\nwould detain you too long, continue to-night. I thank you for this most\r\nextensive audience that you have furnished me to-night. I leave you,\r\nhoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall\r\nno longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT SPRINGFIELD, JULY 17, 1858.\r\n\r\nDELIVERED SATURDAY EVENING\r\n\r\n(Mr. Douglas was not present.)\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--Another election, which is deemed an important one, is\r\napproaching, and, as I suppose, the Republican party will, without much\r\ndifficulty, elect their State ticket. But in regard to the Legislature,\r\nwe, the Republicans, labor under some disadvantages. In the first place,\r\nwe have a Legislature to elect upon an apportionment of the representation\r\nmade several years ago, when the proportion of the population was far\r\ngreater in the South (as compared with the North) than it now is; and\r\ninasmuch as our opponents hold almost entire sway in the South, and we a\r\ncorrespondingly large majority in the North, the fact that we are now to\r\nbe represented as we were years ago, when the population was different,\r\nis to us a very great disadvantage. We had in the year 1855, according to\r\nlaw, a census, or enumeration of the inhabitants, taken for the purpose of\r\na new apportionment of representation. We know what a fair apportionment\r\nof representation upon that census would give us. We know that it could\r\nnot, if fairly made, fail to give the Republican party from six to ten\r\nmore members of the Legislature than they can probably get as the law now\r\nstands. It so happened at the last session of the Legislature that our\r\nopponents, holding the control of both branches of the Legislature,\r\nsteadily refused to give us such an apportionment as we were rightly\r\nentitled to have upon the census already taken. The Legislature steadily\r\nrefused to give us such an apportionment as we were rightfully entitled to\r\nhave upon the census taken of the population of the State. The Legislature\r\nwould pass no bill upon that subject, except such as was at least as\r\nunfair to us as the old one, and in which, in some instances, two men in\r\nthe Democratic regions were allowed to go as far toward sending a member\r\nto the Legislature as three were in the Republican regions. Comparison\r\nwas made at the time as to representative and senatorial districts, which\r\ncompletely demonstrated that such was the fact. Such a bill was passed and\r\ntendered to the Republican Governor for his signature; but, principally\r\nfor the reasons I have stated, he withheld his approval, and the bill fell\r\nwithout becoming a law.\r\n\r\nAnother disadvantage under which we labor is that there are one or two\r\nDemocratic Senators who will be members of the next Legislature, and will\r\nvote for the election of Senator, who are holding over in districts in\r\nwhich we could, on all reasonable calculation, elect men of our own, if\r\nwe only had the chance of an election. When we consider that there are but\r\ntwenty-five Senators in the Senate, taking two from the side where they\r\nrightfully belong, and adding them to the other, is to us a disadvantage\r\nnot to be lightly regarded. Still, so it is; we have this to contend with.\r\nPerhaps there is no ground of complaint on our part. In attending to the\r\nmany things involved in the last general election for President, Governor,\r\nAuditor, Treasurer, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Members of\r\nCongress, of the Legislature, County Officers, and so on, we allowed these\r\nthings to happen by want of sufficient attention, and we have no cause to\r\ncomplain of our adversaries, so far as this matter is concerned. But\r\nwe have some cause to complain of the refusal to give us a fair\r\napportionment.\r\n\r\nThere is still another disadvantage under which we labor, and to which I\r\nwill ask your attention. It arises out of the relative positions of the\r\ntwo persons who stand before the State as candidates for the Senate.\r\nSenator Douglas is of world-wide renown. All the anxious politicians of\r\nhis party, or who have been of his party for years past, have been looking\r\nupon him as certainly, at no distant day, to be the President of\r\nthe United States. They have seen in his round, jolly, fruitful face\r\npost-offices, land-offices, marshalships, and cabinet appointments,\r\ncharge-ships and foreign missions bursting and sprouting out in wonderful\r\nexuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their greedy hands. And as they\r\nhave been gazing upon this attractive picture so long, they cannot, in the\r\nlittle distraction that has taken place in the party, bring themselves to\r\ngive up the charming hope; but with greedier anxiety they rush about\r\nhim, sustain him, and give him marches, triumphal entries, and receptions\r\nbeyond what even in the days of his highest prosperity they could have\r\nbrought about in his favor. On the contrary, nobody has ever expected me\r\nto be President. In my poor, lean, lank face, nobody has ever seen that\r\nany cabbages were sprouting out. These are disadvantages all, taken\r\ntogether, that the Republicans labor under. We have to fight this battle\r\nupon principle, and upon principle alone. I am, in a certain sense, made\r\nthe standard-bearer in behalf of the Republicans. I was made so merely\r\nbecause there had to be some one so placed,--I being in nowise preferable\r\nto any other one of twenty-five, perhaps a hundred, we have in the\r\nRepublican ranks. Then I say I wish it to be distinctly understood and\r\nborne in mind that we have to fight this battle without many--perhaps\r\nwithout any of the external aids which are brought to bear against us.\r\nSo I hope those with whom I am surrounded have principle enough to nerve\r\nthemselves for the task, and leave nothing undone that can be fairly done\r\nto bring about the right result.\r\n\r\nAfter Senator Douglas left Washington, as his movements were made known by\r\nthe public prints, he tarried a considerable time in the city of New\r\nYork; and it was heralded that, like another Napoleon, he was lying by and\r\nframing the plan of his campaign. It was telegraphed to Washington City,\r\nand published in the Union, that he was framing his plan for the purpose\r\nof going to Illinois to pounce upon and annihilate the treasonable and\r\ndisunion speech which Lincoln had made here on the 16th of June. Now, I\r\ndo suppose that the Judge really spent some time in New York maturing the\r\nplan of the campaign, as his friends heralded for him. I have been\r\nable, by noting his movements since his arrival in Illinois, to discover\r\nevidences confirmatory of that allegation. I think I have been able to see\r\nwhat are the material points of that plan. I will, for a little while, ask\r\nyour attention to some of them. What I shall point out, though not showing\r\nthe whole plan, are, nevertheless, the main points, as I suppose.\r\n\r\nThey are not very numerous. The first is popular sovereignty. The second\r\nand third are attacks upon my speech made on the 16th of June. Out of\r\nthese three points--drawing within the range of popular sovereignty the\r\nquestion of the Lecompton Constitution--he makes his principal assault.\r\nUpon these his successive speeches are substantially one and the same.\r\nOn this matter of popular sovereignty I wish to be a little careful.\r\nAuxiliary to these main points, to be sure, are their thunderings of\r\ncannon, their marching and music, their fizzlegigs and fireworks; but I\r\nwill not waste time with them. They are but the little trappings of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nComing to the substance,--the first point, \"popular sovereignty.\" It is to\r\nbe labeled upon the cars in which he travels; put upon the hacks he rides\r\nin; to be flaunted upon the arches he passes under, and the banners which\r\nwave over him. It is to be dished up in as many varieties as a French cook\r\ncan produce soups from potatoes. Now, as this is so great a staple of the\r\nplan of the campaign, it is worth while to examine it carefully; and if\r\nwe examine only a very little, and do not allow ourselves to be misled,\r\nwe shall be able to see that the whole thing is the most arrant Quixotism\r\nthat was ever enacted before a community. What is the matter of popular\r\nsovereignty? The first thing, in order to understand it, is to get a good\r\ndefinition of what it is, and after that to see how it is applied.\r\n\r\nI suppose almost every one knows that, in this controversy, whatever has\r\nbeen said has had reference to the question of negro slavery. We have not\r\nbeen in a controversy about the right of the people to govern themselves\r\nin the ordinary matters of domestic concern in the States and Territories.\r\nMr. Buchanan, in one of his late messages (I think when he sent up the\r\nLecompton Constitution) urged that the main point to which the public\r\nattention had been directed was not in regard to the great variety of\r\nsmall domestic matters, but was directed to the question of negro slavery;\r\nand he asserts that if the people had had a fair chance to vote on that\r\nquestion there was no reasonable ground of objection in regard to minor\r\nquestions. Now, while I think that the people had not had given, or\r\noffered, them a fair chance upon that slavery question, still, if\r\nthere had been a fair submission to a vote upon that main question, the\r\nPresident's proposition would have been true to the utmost. Hence, when\r\nhereafter I speak of popular sovereignty, I wish to be understood as\r\napplying what I say to the question of slavery only, not to other minor\r\ndomestic matters of a Territory or a State.\r\n\r\nDoes Judge Douglas, when he says that several of the past years of his\r\nlife have been devoted to the question of \"popular sovereignty,\" and that\r\nall the remainder of his life shall be devoted to it, does he mean to\r\nsay that he has been devoting his life to securing to the people of the\r\nTerritories the right to exclude slavery from the Territories? If he means\r\nso to say he means to deceive; because he and every one knows that the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court, which he approves and makes especial ground\r\nof attack upon me for disapproving, forbids the people of a Territory to\r\nexclude slavery. This covers the whole ground, from the settlement of a\r\nTerritory till it reaches the degree of maturity entitling it to form a\r\nState Constitution. So far as all that ground is concerned, the Judge\r\nis not sustaining popular sovereignty, but absolutely opposing it.\r\nHe sustains the decision which declares that the popular will of the\r\nTerritory has no constitutional power to exclude slavery during their\r\nterritorial existence. This being so, the period of time from the first\r\nsettlement of a Territory till it reaches the point of forming a State\r\nConstitution is not the thing that the Judge has fought for or is fighting\r\nfor, but, on the contrary, he has fought for, and is fighting for, the\r\nthing that annihilates and crushes out that same popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\nWell, so much being disposed of, what is left? Why, he is contending for\r\nthe right of the people, when they come to make a State Constitution,\r\nto make it for themselves, and precisely as best suits themselves. I say\r\nagain, that is quixotic. I defy contradiction when I declare that the\r\nJudge can find no one to oppose him on that proposition. I repeat,\r\nthere is nobody opposing that proposition on principle. Let me not be\r\nmisunderstood. I know that, with reference to the Lecompton Constitution,\r\nI may be misunderstood; but when you understand me correctly, my\r\nproposition will be true and accurate. Nobody is opposing, or has opposed,\r\nthe right of the people, when they form a constitution, to form it for\r\nthemselves. Mr. Buchanan and his friends have not done it; they, too, as\r\nwell as the Republicans and the Anti-Lecompton Democrats, have not done\r\nit; but on the contrary, they together have insisted on the right of the\r\npeople to form a constitution for themselves. The difference between the\r\nBuchanan men on the one hand, and the Douglas men and the Republicans on\r\nthe other, has not been on a question of principle, but on a question of\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe dispute was upon the question of fact, whether the Lecompton\r\nConstitution had been fairly formed by the people or not. Mr. Buchanan and\r\nhis friends have not contended for the contrary principle any more than\r\nthe Douglas men or the Republicans. They have insisted that whatever of\r\nsmall irregularities existed in getting up the Lecompton Constitution were\r\nsuch as happen in the settlement of all new Territories. The question was,\r\nWas it a fair emanation of the people? It was a question of fact, and not\r\nof principle. As to the principle, all were agreed. Judge Douglas voted\r\nwith the Republicans upon that matter of fact.\r\n\r\nHe and they, by their voices and votes, denied that it was a fair\r\nemanation of the people. The Administration affirmed that it was. With\r\nrespect to the evidence bearing upon that question of fact, I readily\r\nagree that Judge Douglas and the Republicans had the right on their side,\r\nand that the Administration was wrong. But I state again that, as a\r\nmatter of principle, there is no dispute upon the right of a people in\r\na Territory, merging into a State, to form a constitution for themselves\r\nwithout outside interference from any quarter. This being so, what is\r\nJudge Douglas going to spend his life for? Is he going to spend his life\r\nin maintaining a principle that nobody on earth opposes? Does he expect to\r\nstand up in majestic dignity, and go through his apotheosis and become a\r\ngod in the maintaining of a principle which neither man nor mouse in\r\nall God's creation is opposing? Now something in regard to the Lecompton\r\nConstitution more specially; for I pass from this other question of\r\npopular sovereignty as the most arrant humbug that has ever been attempted\r\non an intelligent community.\r\n\r\nAs to the Lecompton Constitution, I have already said that on the question\r\nof fact, as to whether it was a fair emanation of the people or not, Judge\r\nDouglas, with the Republicans and some Americans, had greatly the argument\r\nagainst the Administration; and while I repeat this, I wish to know what\r\nthere is in the opposition of Judge Douglas to the Lecompton Constitution\r\nthat entitles him to be considered the only opponent to it,--as being\r\npar excellence the very quintessence of that opposition. I agree to the\r\nrightfulness of his opposition. He in the Senate and his class of men\r\nthere formed the number three and no more. In the House of Representatives\r\nhis class of men--the Anti-Lecompton Democrats--formed a number of about\r\ntwenty. It took one hundred and twenty to defeat the measure, against one\r\nhundred and twelve. Of the votes of that one hundred and twenty, Judge\r\nDouglas's friends furnished twenty, to add to which there were six\r\nAmericans and ninety-four Republicans. I do not say that I am precisely\r\naccurate in their numbers, but I am sufficiently so for any use I am\r\nmaking of it.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that twenty shall be entitled to all the credit of doing that\r\nwork, and the hundred none of it? Why, if, as Judge Douglas says, the\r\nhonor is to be divided and due credit is to be given to other parties, why\r\nis just so much given as is consonant with the wishes, the interests, and\r\nadvancement of the twenty? My understanding is, when a common job is done,\r\nor a common enterprise prosecuted, if I put in five dollars to your one,\r\nI have a right to take out five dollars to your one. But he does not so\r\nunderstand it. He declares the dividend of credit for defeating Lecompton\r\nupon a basis which seems unprecedented and incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nLet us see. Lecompton in the raw was defeated. It afterward took a sort\r\nof cooked-up shape, and was passed in the English bill. It is said by the\r\nJudge that the defeat was a good and proper thing. If it was a good thing,\r\nwhy is he entitled to more credit than others for the performance of that\r\ngood act, unless there was something in the antecedents of the Republicans\r\nthat might induce every one to expect them to join in that good work, and\r\nat the same time something leading them to doubt that he would? Does he\r\nplace his superior claim to credit on the ground that he performed a\r\ngood act which was never expected of him? He says I have a proneness for\r\nquoting Scripture. If I should do so now, it occurs that perhaps he places\r\nhimself somewhat upon the ground of the parable of the lost sheep which\r\nwent astray upon the mountains, and when the owner of the hundred sheep\r\nfound the one that was lost, and threw it upon his shoulders and came home\r\nrejoicing, it was said that there was more rejoicing over the one sheep\r\nthat was lost and had been found than over the ninety and nine in the\r\nfold. The application is made by the Saviour in this parable, thus:\r\n\"Verily, I say unto you, there is more rejoicing in heaven over one\r\nsinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons that need no\r\nrepentance.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, if the Judge claims the benefit of this parable, let him repent.\r\nLet him not come up here and say: \"I am the only just person; and you are\r\nthe ninety-nine sinners!\" Repentance before forgiveness is a provision\r\nof the Christian system, and on that condition alone will the Republicans\r\ngrant his forgiveness.\r\n\r\nHow will he prove that we have ever occupied a different position in\r\nregard to the Lecompton Constitution or any principle in it? He says he\r\ndid not make his opposition on the ground as to whether it was a free or\r\nslave constitution, and he would have you understand that the Republicans\r\nmade their opposition because it ultimately became a slave constitution.\r\nTo make proof in favor of himself on this point, he reminds us that he\r\nopposed Lecompton before the vote was taken declaring whether the State\r\nwas to be free or slave. But he forgets to say that our Republican\r\nSenator, Trumbull, made a speech against Lecompton even before he did.\r\n\r\nWhy did he oppose it? Partly, as he declares, because the members of the\r\nconvention who framed it were not fairly elected by the people; that the\r\npeople were not allowed to vote unless they had been registered; and that\r\nthe people of whole counties, some instances, were not registered. For\r\nthese reasons he declares the Constitution was not an emanation, in any\r\ntrue sense, from the people. He also has an additional objection as to the\r\nmode of submitting the Constitution back to the people. But bearing on the\r\nquestion of whether the delegates were fairly elected, a speech of his,\r\nmade something more than twelve months ago, from this stand, becomes\r\nimportant. It was made a little while before the election of the delegates\r\nwho made Lecompton. In that speech he declared there was every reason\r\nto hope and believe the election would be fair; and if any one failed to\r\nvote, it would be his own culpable fault.\r\n\r\nI, a few days after, made a sort of answer to that speech. In that answer\r\nI made, substantially, the very argument with which he combated his\r\nLecompton adversaries in the Senate last winter. I pointed to the facts\r\nthat the people could not vote without being registered, and that the time\r\nfor registering had gone by. I commented on it as wonderful that Judge\r\nDouglas could be ignorant of these facts which every one else in the\r\nnation so well knew.\r\n\r\nI now pass from popular sovereignty and Lecompton. I may have occasion to\r\nrefer to one or both.\r\n\r\nWhen he was preparing his plan of campaign, Napoleon-like, in New York,\r\nas appears by two speeches I have heard him deliver since his arrival in\r\nIllinois, he gave special attention to a speech of mine, delivered here on\r\nthe 16th of June last. He says that he carefully read that speech. He told\r\nus that at Chicago a week ago last night and he repeated it at Bloomington\r\nlast night. Doubtless, he repeated it again to-day, though I did not hear\r\nhim. In the first two places--Chicago and Bloomington I heard him; to-day\r\nI did not. He said he had carefully examined that speech,--when, he did\r\nnot say; but there is no reasonable doubt it was when he was in New York\r\npreparing his plan of campaign. I am glad he did read it carefully. He\r\nsays it was evidently prepared with great care. I freely admit it\r\nwas prepared with care. I claim not to be more free from errors than\r\nothers,--perhaps scarcely so much; but I was very careful not to put\r\nanything in that speech as a matter of fact, or make any inferences, which\r\ndid not appear to me to be true and fully warrantable. If I had made any\r\nmistake, I was willing to be corrected; if I had drawn any inference in\r\nregard to Judge Douglas or any one else which was not warranted, I was\r\nfully prepared to modify it as soon as discovered. I planted myself upon\r\nthe truth and the truth only, so far as I knew it, or could be brought to\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\nHaving made that speech with the most kindly feelings toward Judge\r\nDouglas, as manifested therein, I was gratified when I found that he\r\nhad carefully examined it, and had detected no error of fact, nor any\r\ninference against him, nor any misrepresentations of which he thought fit\r\nto complain. In neither of the two speeches I have mentioned did he make\r\nany such complaint. I will thank any one who will inform me that he, in\r\nhis speech to-day, pointed out anything I had stated respecting him as\r\nbeing erroneous. I presume there is no such thing. I have reason to be\r\ngratified that the care and caution used in that speech left it so that\r\nhe, most of all others interested in discovering error, has not been able\r\nto point out one thing against him which he could say was wrong. He seizes\r\nupon the doctrines he supposes to be included in that speech, and declares\r\nthat upon them will turn the issues of this campaign. He then quotes,\r\nor attempts to quote, from my speech. I will not say that he wilfully\r\nmisquotes, but he does fail to quote accurately. His attempt at quoting is\r\nfrom a passage which I believe I can quote accurately from memory. I shall\r\nmake the quotation now, with some comments upon it, as I have already\r\nsaid, in order that the Judge shall be left entirely without excuse for\r\nmisrepresenting me. I do so now, as I hope, for the last time. I do this\r\nin great caution, in order that if he repeats his misrepresentation it\r\nshall be plain to all that he does so wilfully. If, after all, he still\r\npersists, I shall be compelled to reconstruct the course I have marked\r\nout for myself, and draw upon such humble resources, as I have, for a new\r\ncourse, better suited to the real exigencies of the case. I set out in\r\nthis campaign with the intention of conducting it strictly as a gentleman,\r\nin substance at least, if not in the outside polish. The latter I shall\r\nnever be; but that which constitutes the inside of a gentleman I hope I\r\nunderstand, and am not less inclined to practice than others. It was\r\nmy purpose and expectation that this canvass would be conducted upon\r\nprinciple, and with fairness on both sides, and it shall not be my fault\r\nif this purpose and expectation shall be given up.\r\n\r\nHe charges, in substance, that I invite a war of sections; that I\r\npropose all the local institutions of the different States shall become\r\nconsolidated and uniform. What is there in the language of that speech\r\nwhich expresses such purpose or bears such construction? I have again and\r\nagain said that I would not enter into any of the States to disturb the\r\ninstitution of slavery. Judge Douglas said, at Bloomington, that I used\r\nlanguage most able and ingenious for concealing what I really meant;\r\nand that while I had protested against entering into the slave States, I\r\nnevertheless did mean to go on the banks of the Ohio and throw missiles\r\ninto Kentucky, to disturb them in their domestic institutions.\r\n\r\nI said in that speech, and I meant no more, that the institution of\r\nslavery ought to be placed in the very attitude where the framers of this\r\ngovernment placed it and left it. I do not understand that the framers\r\nof our Constitution left the people of the free States in the attitude of\r\nfiring bombs or shells into the slave States. I was not using that passage\r\nfor the purpose for which he infers I did use it. I said:\r\n\r\n\"We are now far advanced into the fifth year since a policy was created\r\nfor the avowed object and with the confident promise of putting an end to\r\nslavery agitation. Under the operation of that policy that agitation has\r\nnot only not ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion it will\r\nnot cease till a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house\r\ndivided against itself cannot stand.' I believe that this government\r\ncannot endure permanently half slave and half free; it will become all one\r\nthing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the\r\nfurther spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the\r\nbelief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates\r\nwill push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States,\r\nold as well as new, North as well as South.\"\r\n\r\nNow, you all see, from that quotation, I did not express my wish on\r\nanything. In that passage I indicated no wish or purpose of my own; I\r\nsimply expressed my expectation. Cannot the Judge perceive a distinction\r\nbetween a purpose and an expectation? I have often expressed an\r\nexpectation to die, but I have never expressed a wish to die. I said\r\nat Chicago, and now repeat, that I am quite aware this government has\r\nendured, half slave and half free, for eighty-two years. I understand\r\nthat little bit of history. I expressed the opinion I did because I\r\nperceived--or thought I perceived--a new set of causes introduced. I did\r\nsay at Chicago, in my speech there, that I do wish to see the spread of\r\nslavery arrested, and to see it placed where the public mind shall rest\r\nin the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction. I said that\r\nbecause I supposed, when the public mind shall rest in that belief,\r\nwe shall have peace on the slavery question. I have believed--and now\r\nbelieve--the public mind did rest on that belief up to the introduction of\r\nthe Nebraska Bill.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have ever been opposed to slavery, so far I rested in the hope\r\nand belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. For that\r\nreason it had been a minor question with me. I might have been mistaken;\r\nbut I had believed, and now believe, that the whole public mind, that is,\r\nthe mind of the great majority, had rested in that belief up to the repeal\r\nof the Missouri Compromise. But upon that event I became convinced that\r\neither I had been resting in a delusion, or the institution was being\r\nplaced on a new basis, a basis for making it perpetual, national, and\r\nuniversal. Subsequent events have greatly confirmed me in that belief. I\r\nbelieve that bill to be the beginning of a conspiracy for that purpose. So\r\nbelieving, I have since then considered that question a paramount one.\r\nSo believing, I thought the public mind will never rest till the power\r\nof Congress to restrict the spread of it shall again be acknowledged and\r\nexercised on the one hand or, on the other, all resistance be entirely\r\ncrushed out. I have expressed that opinion, and I entertain it to-night.\r\nIt is denied that there is any tendency to the nationalization of slavery\r\nin these States.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks, of South Carolina, in one of his speeches, when they were\r\npresenting him canes, silver plate, gold pitchers, and the like, for\r\nassaulting Senator Sumner, distinctly affirmed his opinion that when this\r\nConstitution was formed it was the belief of no man that slavery would\r\nlast to the present day. He said, what I think, that the framers of our\r\nConstitution placed the institution of slavery where the public mind\r\nrested in the hope that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. But\r\nhe went on to say that the men of the present age, by their experience,\r\nhave become wiser than the framers of the Constitution, and the invention\r\nof the cotton gin had made the perpetuity of slavery a necessity in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs another piece of evidence tending to this same point: Quite recently in\r\nVirginia, a man--the owner of slaves--made a will providing that after his\r\ndeath certain of his slaves should have their freedom if they should so\r\nchoose, and go to Liberia, rather than remain in slavery. They chose to be\r\nliberated. But the persons to whom they would descend as property claimed\r\nthem as slaves. A suit was instituted, which finally came to the Supreme\r\nCourt of Virginia, and was therein decided against the slaves upon the\r\nground that a negro cannot make a choice; that they had no legal power to\r\nchoose, could not perform the condition upon which their freedom depended.\r\n\r\nI do not mention this with any purpose of criticizing it, but to connect\r\nit with the arguments as affording additional evidence of the change of\r\nsentiment upon this question of slavery in the direction of making it\r\nperpetual and national. I argue now as I did before, that there is such\r\na tendency; and I am backed, not merely by the facts, but by the open\r\nconfession in the slave States.\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the Judge's inference that because I wish to see slavery\r\nplaced in the course of ultimate extinction,--placed where our fathers\r\noriginally placed it,--I wish to annihilate the State Legislatures, to\r\nforce cotton to grow upon the tops of the Green Mountains, to freeze ice\r\nin Florida, to cut lumber on the broad Illinois prairie,--that I am in\r\nfavor of all these ridiculous and impossible things.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me it is a complete answer to all this to ask if, when\r\nCongress did have the fashion of restricting slavery from free territory;\r\nwhen courts did have the fashion of deciding that taking a slave into a\r\nfree country made him free,--I say it is a sufficient answer to ask if\r\nany of this ridiculous nonsense about consolidation and uniformity did\r\nactually follow. Who heard of any such thing because of the Ordinance of\r\n'87? because of the Missouri restriction? because of the numerous court\r\ndecisions of that character?\r\n\r\nNow, as to the Dred Scott decision; for upon that he makes his last point\r\nat me. He boldly takes ground in favor of that decision.\r\n\r\nThis is one half the onslaught, and one third of the entire plan of the\r\ncampaign. I am opposed to that decision in a certain sense, but not in\r\nthe sense which he puts it. I say that in so far as it decided in favor\r\nof Dred Scott's master, and against Dred Scott and his family, I do not\r\npropose to disturb or resist the decision.\r\n\r\nI never have proposed to do any such thing. I think that in respect for\r\njudicial authority my humble history would not suffer in comparison with\r\nthat of Judge Douglas. He would have the citizen conform his vote to that\r\ndecision; the member of Congress, his; the President, his use of the veto\r\npower. He would make it a rule of political action for the people and\r\nall the departments of the government. I would not. By resisting it as a\r\npolitical rule, I disturb no right of property, create no disorder, excite\r\nno mobs.\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke at Chicago, on Friday evening of last week, he made this\r\nsame point upon me. On Saturday evening I replied, and reminded him of a\r\nSupreme Court decision which he opposed for at least several years. Last\r\nnight, at Bloomington, he took some notice of that reply, but entirely\r\nforgot to remember that part of it.\r\n\r\nHe renews his onslaught upon me, forgetting to remember that I have turned\r\nthe tables against himself on that very point. I renew the effort to draw\r\nhis attention to it. I wish to stand erect before the country, as well as\r\nJudge Douglas, on this question of judicial authority; and therefore I\r\nadd something to the authority in favor of my own position. I wish to\r\nshow that I am sustained by authority, in addition to that heretofore\r\npresented. I do not expect to convince the Judge. It is part of the plan\r\nof his campaign, and he will cling to it with a desperate grip. Even turn\r\nit upon him,--the sharp point against him, and gaff him through,--he will\r\nstill cling to it till he can invent some new dodge to take the place of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn public speaking it is tedious reading from documents; but I must beg\r\nto indulge the practice to a limited extent. I shall read from a letter\r\nwritten by Mr. Jefferson in 1820, and now to be found in the seventh\r\nvolume of his correspondence, at page 177. It seems he had been presented\r\nby a gentleman of the name of Jarvis with a book, or essay, or periodical,\r\ncalled the Republican, and he was writing in acknowledgment of the\r\npresent, and noting some of its contents. After expressing the hope that\r\nthe work will produce a favorable effect upon the minds of the young, he\r\nproceeds to say:\r\n\r\n\"That it will have this tendency may be expected, and for that reason I\r\nfeel an urgency to note what I deem an error in it, the more requiring\r\nnotice as your opinion is strengthened by that of many others. You seem,\r\nin pages 84 and 148, to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of\r\nall constitutional questions,--a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one\r\nwhich would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are\r\nas honest as other men, and not more so. They have, with others, the same\r\npassions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps. Their\r\nmaxim is, 'Boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem'; and their power is\r\nthe more dangerous as they are in office for life, and not responsible, as\r\nthe other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has\r\nerected no such single tribunal, knowing that, to whatever hands confided,\r\nwith the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots.\r\nIt has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign with\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nThus we see the power claimed for the Supreme Court by Judge Douglas, Mr.\r\nJefferson holds, would reduce us to the despotism of an oligarchy.\r\n\r\nNow, I have said no more than this,--in fact, never quite so much as this;\r\nat least I am sustained by Mr. Jefferson.\r\n\r\nLet us go a little further. You remember we once had a National Bank. Some\r\none owed the bank a debt; he was sued, and sought to avoid payment on the\r\nground that the bank was unconstitutional. The case went to the Supreme\r\nCourt, and therein it was decided that the bank was constitutional. The\r\nwhole Democratic party revolted against that decision. General Jackson\r\nhimself asserted that he, as President, would not be bound to hold a\r\nNational Bank to be constitutional, even though the court had decided it\r\nto be so. He fell in precisely with the view of Mr. Jefferson, and acted\r\nupon it under his official oath, in vetoing a charter for a National Bank.\r\nThe declaration that Congress does not possess this constitutional power\r\nto charter a bank has gone into the Democratic platform, at their\r\nNational Conventions, and was brought forward and reaffirmed in their last\r\nConvention at Cincinnati. They have contended for that declaration, in the\r\nvery teeth of the Supreme Court, for more than a quarter of a century.\r\nIn fact, they have reduced the decision to an absolute nullity. That\r\ndecision, I repeat, is repudiated in the Cincinnati platform; and still,\r\nas if to show that effrontery can go no further, Judge Douglas vaunts in\r\nthe very speeches in which he denounces me for opposing the Dred Scott\r\ndecision that he stands on the Cincinnati platform.\r\n\r\nNow, I wish to know what the Judge can charge upon me, with respect to\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, which does not lie in all its length,\r\nbreadth, and proportions at his own door. The plain truth is simply this:\r\nJudge Douglas is for Supreme Court decisions when he likes and against\r\nthem when he does not like them. He is for the Dred Scott decision because\r\nit tends to nationalize slavery; because it is part of the original\r\ncombination for that object. It so happens, singularly enough, that I\r\nnever stood opposed to a decision of the Supreme Court till this, on the\r\ncontrary, I have no recollection that he was ever particularly in favor of\r\none till this. He never was in favor of any nor opposed to any, till the\r\npresent one, which helps to nationalize slavery.\r\n\r\nFree men of Sangamon, free men of Illinois, free men everywhere, judge ye\r\nbetween him and me upon this issue.\r\n\r\nHe says this Dred Scott case is a very small matter at most,--that it has\r\nno practical effect; that at best, or rather, I suppose, at worst, it is\r\nbut an abstraction. I submit that the proposition that the thing which\r\ndetermines whether a man is free or a slave is rather concrete than\r\nabstract. I think you would conclude that it was, if your liberty depended\r\nupon it, and so would Judge Douglas, if his liberty depended upon it.\r\nBut suppose it was on the question of spreading slavery over the new\r\nTerritories that he considers it as being merely an abstract matter, and\r\none of no practical importance. How has the planting of slavery in new\r\ncountries always been effected? It has now been decided that slavery\r\ncannot be kept out of our new Territories by any legal means. In what do\r\nour new Territories now differ in this respect from the old Colonies when\r\nslavery was first planted within them? It was planted, as Mr. Clay once\r\ndeclared, and as history proves true, by individual men, in spite of the\r\nwishes of the people; the Mother Government refusing to prohibit it, and\r\nwithholding from the people of the Colonies the authority to prohibit it\r\nfor themselves. Mr. Clay says this was one of the great and just causes of\r\ncomplaint against Great Britain by the Colonies, and the best apology\r\nwe can now make for having the institution amongst us. In that precise\r\ncondition our Nebraska politicians have at last succeeded in placing our\r\nown new Territories; the government will not prohibit slavery within them,\r\nnor allow the people to prohibit it.\r\n\r\nI defy any man to find any difference between the policy which originally\r\nplanted slavery in these Colonies and that policy which now prevails in\r\nour new Territories. If it does not go into them, it is only because no\r\nindividual wishes it to go. The Judge indulged himself doubtless to-day\r\nwith the question as to what I am going to do with or about the Dred Scott\r\ndecision. Well, Judge, will you please tell me what you did about the\r\nbank decision? Will you not graciously allow us to do with the Dred Scott\r\ndecision precisely as you did with the bank decision? You succeeded in\r\nbreaking down the moral effect of that decision: did you find it necessary\r\nto amend the Constitution, or to set up a court of negroes in order to do\r\nit?\r\n\r\nThere is one other point. Judge Douglas has a very affectionate leaning\r\ntoward the Americans and Old Whigs. Last evening, in a sort of weeping\r\ntone, he described to us a death-bed scene. He had been called to the side\r\nof Mr. Clay, in his last moments, in order that the genius of \"popular\r\nsovereignty\" might duly descend from the dying man and settle upon him,\r\nthe living and most worthy successor. He could do no less than promise\r\nthat he would devote the remainder of his life to \"popular sovereignty\";\r\nand then the great statesman departs in peace. By this part of the \"plan\r\nof the campaign\" the Judge has evidently promised himself that tears shall\r\nbe drawn down the cheeks of all Old Whigs, as large as half-grown apples.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, too, was mentioned; but it did not quite come to a death-bed\r\nscene as to him. It would be amusing, if it were not disgusting, to see\r\nhow quick these compromise-breakers administer on the political effects\r\nof their dead adversaries, trumping up claims never before heard of, and\r\ndividing the assets among themselves. If I should be found dead to-morrow\r\nmorning, nothing but my insignificance could prevent a speech being made\r\non my authority, before the end of next week. It so happens that in that\r\n\"popular sovereignty\" with which Mr. Clay was identified, the Missouri\r\nCompromise was expressly reversed; and it was a little singular if Mr.\r\nClay cast his mantle upon Judge Douglas on purpose to have that compromise\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Judge did not keep faith with Mr. Clay when he first brought in\r\nhis Nebraska Bill. He left the Missouri Compromise unrepealed, and in his\r\nreport accompanying the bill he told the world he did it on purpose. The\r\nmanes of Mr. Clay must have been in great agony till thirty days later,\r\nwhen \"popular sovereignty\" stood forth in all its glory.\r\n\r\nOne more thing. Last night Judge Douglas tormented himself with horrors\r\nabout my disposition to make negroes perfectly equal with white men in\r\nsocial and political relations. He did not stop to show that I have said\r\nany such thing, or that it legitimately follows from anything I have\r\nsaid, but he rushes on with his assertions. I adhere to the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. If Judge Douglas and his friends are not willing to stand by\r\nit, let them come up and amend it. Let them make it read that all men\r\nare created equal except negroes. Let us have it decided whether the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, in this blessed year of 1858, shall be thus\r\namended. In his construction of the Declaration last year, he said it only\r\nmeant that Americans in America were equal to Englishmen in England. Then,\r\nwhen I pointed out to him that by that rule he excludes the Germans, the\r\nIrish, the Portuguese, and all the other people who have come among us\r\nsince the revolution, he reconstructs his construction. In his last speech\r\nhe tells us it meant Europeans.\r\n\r\nI press him a little further, and ask if it meant to include the Russians\r\nin Asia; or does he mean to exclude that vast population from the\r\nprinciples of our Declaration of Independence? I expect ere long he\r\nwill introduce another amendment to his definition. He is not at all\r\nparticular. He is satisfied with anything which does not endanger the\r\nnationalizing of negro slavery. It may draw white men down, but it must\r\nnot lift negroes up.\r\n\r\nWho shall say, \"I am the superior, and you are the inferior\"?\r\n\r\nMy declarations upon this subject of negro slavery may be misrepresented,\r\nbut cannot be misunderstood. I have said that I do not understand the\r\nDeclaration to mean that all men were created equal in all respects. They\r\nare not our equal in color; but I suppose that it does mean to declare\r\nthat all men are equal in some respects; they are equal in their right to\r\n\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Certainly the negro is\r\nnot our equal in color, perhaps not in many other respects; still, in the\r\nright to put into his mouth the bread that his own hands have earned, he\r\nis the equal of every other man, white or black. In pointing out that\r\nmore has been given you, you cannot be justified in taking away the little\r\nwhich has been given him. All I ask for the negro is that if you do not\r\nlike him, let him alone. If God gave him but little, that little let him\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\nWhen our government was established we had the institution of slavery\r\namong us. We were in a certain sense compelled to tolerate its existence.\r\nIt was a sort of necessity. We had gone through our struggle and\r\nsecured our own independence. The framers of the Constitution found the\r\ninstitution of slavery amongst their own institutions at the time. They\r\nfound that by an effort to eradicate it they might lose much of what they\r\nhad already gained. They were obliged to bow to the necessity. They gave\r\npower to Congress to abolish the slave trade at the end of twenty years.\r\nThey also prohibited it in the Territories where it did not exist. They\r\ndid what they could, and yielded to the necessity for the rest. I also\r\nyield to all which follows from that necessity. What I would most desire\r\nwould be the separation of the white and black races.\r\n\r\nOne more point on this Springfield speech which Judge Douglas says he has\r\nread so carefully. I expressed my belief in the existence of a conspiracy\r\nto perpetuate and nationalize slavery. I did not profess to know it, nor\r\ndo I now. I showed the part Judge Douglas had played in the string of\r\nfacts constituting to my mind the proof of that conspiracy. I showed the\r\nparts played by others.\r\n\r\nI charged that the people had been deceived into carrying the last\r\nPresidential election, by the impression that the people of the\r\nTerritories might exclude slavery if they chose, when it was known in\r\nadvance by the conspirators that the court was to decide that neither\r\nCongress nor the people could so exclude slavery. These charges are more\r\ndistinctly made than anything else in the speech.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas has carefully read and reread that speech. He has not, so\r\nfar as I know, contradicted those charges. In the two speeches which I\r\nheard he certainly did not. On this own tacit admission, I renew that\r\ncharge. I charge him with having been a party to that conspiracy and to\r\nthat deception for the sole purpose of nationalizing slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS\r\n\r\n[The following is the correspondence between the two rival candidates for\r\nthe United States Senate]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. LINCOLN TO MR. DOUGLAS.\r\n\r\nCHICAGO, ILL., July 24, 1558.\r\n\r\nHON. S. A.

Although, by the terms,\r\nas you propose, you take four openings and closes, to my three, I accede,\r\nand thus close the arrangement. I direct this to you at Hillsborough,\r\nand shall try to have both your letter and this appear in the Journal and\r\nRegister of Monday morning.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST JOINT DEBATE, AT OTTAWA,\r\n\r\nAUGUST 21, 1858\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN'S REPLY\r\n\r\nMY FELLOW-CITIZENS:--When a man hears himself somewhat misrepresented,\r\nit provokes him, at least, I find it so with myself; but when\r\nmisrepresentation becomes very gross and palpable, it is more apt to amuse\r\nhim. The first thing I see fit to notice is the fact that Judge Douglas\r\nalleges, after running through the history of the old Democratic and the\r\nold Whig parties, that Judge Trumbull and myself made an arrangement in\r\n1854, by which I was to have the place of General Shields in the United\r\nStates Senate, and Judge Trumbull was to have the place of Judge Douglas.\r\nNow, all I have to say upon that subject is that I think no man not even\r\nJudge Douglas can prove it, because it is not true. I have no doubt he is\r\n\"conscientious\" in saying it. As to those resolutions that he took such a\r\nlength of time to read, as being the platform of the Republican party in\r\n1854, I say I never had anything to do with them, and I think Trumbull\r\nnever had. Judge Douglas cannot show that either of us ever did have\r\nanything to do with them.\r\n\r\nI believe this is true about those resolutions: There was a call for a\r\nconvention to form a Republican party at Springfield, and I think that my\r\nfriend Mr. Lovejoy, who is here upon this stand, had a hand in it. I think\r\nthis is true, and I think if he will remember accurately he will be able\r\nto recollect that he tried to get me into it, and I would not go in.\r\nI believe it is also true that I went away from Springfield when the\r\nconvention was in session, to attend court in Tazewell county. It is true\r\nthey did place my name, though without authority, upon the committee, and\r\nafterward wrote me to attend the meeting of the committee; but I refused\r\nto do so, and I never had anything to do with that organization. This is\r\nthe plain truth about all that matter of the resolutions.\r\n\r\nNow, about this story that Judge Douglas tells of Trumbull bargaining to\r\nsell out the old Democratic party, and Lincoln agreeing to sell out the\r\nold Whig party, I have the means of knowing about that: Judge Douglas\r\ncannot have; and I know there is no substance to it whatever. Yet I have\r\nno doubt he is \"conscientious\" about it. I know that after Mr. Lovejoy got\r\ninto the Legislature that winter, he complained of me that I had told all\r\nthe old Whigs of his district that the old Whig party was good enough for\r\nthem, and some of them voted against him because I told them so. Now, I\r\nhave no means of totally disproving such charges as this which the Judge\r\nmakes. A man cannot prove a negative; but he has a right to claim that\r\nwhen a man makes an affirmative charge, he must offer some proof to show\r\nthe truth of what he says. I certainly cannot introduce testimony to show\r\nthe negative about things, but I have a right to claim that if a man says\r\nhe knows a thing, then he must show how he knows it. I always have a\r\nright to claim this, and it is not satisfactory to me that he may be\r\n\"conscientious\" on the subject.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, I hate to waste my time on such things; but in regard to\r\nthat general Abolition tilt that Judge Douglas makes, when he says that\r\nI was engaged at that time in selling out and Abolitionizing the old Whig\r\nparty, I hope you will permit me to read a part of a printed speech that\r\nI made then at Peoria, which will show altogether a different view of the\r\nposition I took in that contest of 1854.\r\n\r\n[Voice: \"Put on your specs.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN: Yes, sir, I am obliged to do so; I am no longer a young man.\r\n\r\n\"This is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The foregoing history\r\nmay not be precisely accurate in every particular, but I am sure it is\r\nsufficiently so for all the uses I shall attempt to make of it, and in\r\nit we have before us the chief materials enabling us to correctly judge\r\nwhether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong.\r\n\r\n\"I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong--wrong in its direct\r\neffect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska, and wrong in its\r\nprospective principle, allowing it to spread to every other part of the\r\nwide world where men can be found inclined to take it.\r\n\r\n\"This declared indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal\r\nfor the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the\r\nmonstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives\r\nour republican example of its just influence in the world,--enables\r\nthe enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as\r\nhypocrites; causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity,\r\nand especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves\r\ninto an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty,\r\ncriticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is\r\nno right principle of action but self-interest.\r\n\r\n\"Before proceeding, let me say I think I have no prejudice against the\r\nSouthern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If\r\nslavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it\r\ndid now exist among us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe\r\nof the masses north and south. Doubtless there are individuals on both\r\nsides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances; and others who\r\nwould gladly introduce slavery anew, if it were out of existence. We know\r\nthat some Southern men do free their slaves, go north, and become tip-top\r\nAbolitionists; while some Northern ones go south and become most cruel\r\nslave-masters.\r\n\r\n\"When Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin\r\nof slavery than we, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the\r\ninstitution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it, in any\r\nsatisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I will not\r\nblame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself. If\r\nall earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do, as to the\r\nexisting institution. My first impulse would be to free all the slaves and\r\nsend them to Liberia,--to their own native land. But a moment's reflection\r\nwould convince me that whatever of high hope (as I think there is) there\r\nmay be in this in the long term, its sudden execution is impossible. If\r\nthey were all landed there in a day, they would all perish in the next ten\r\ndays; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the\r\nworld to carry them there in many times ten days. What then? Free them\r\nall and keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this\r\nbetters their condition? I think I would not hold one in slavery, at any\r\nrate; yet the point is not clear enough to me to denounce people upon.\r\nWhat next? Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals?\r\nMy own feelings will not admit of this; and if mine would, we well know\r\nthat those of the great mass of white people will not. Whether this\r\nfeeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the sole question,\r\nif, indeed, it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill\r\nfounded, cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot, then, make them equals.\r\nIt does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted;\r\nbut for their tardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our brethren\r\nof the South.\r\n\r\n\"When they remind us of their constitutional rights, I acknowledge\r\nthem, not grudgingly, but fully and fairly; and I would give them any\r\nlegislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives, which should not, in\r\nits stringency, be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than Our\r\nordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one.\r\n\r\n\"But all this, to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse for permitting\r\nslavery to go into our own free territory than it would for reviving the\r\nAfrican slave-trade by law. The law which forbids the bringing of slaves\r\nfrom Africa, and that which has so long forbid the taking of them to\r\nNebraska, can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle; and the\r\nrepeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the\r\nlatter.\"\r\n\r\nI have reason to know that Judge Douglas knows that I said this. I think\r\nhe has the answer here to one of the questions he put to me. I do not mean\r\nto allow him to catechize me unless he pays back for it in kind. I will\r\nnot answer questions one after another, unless he reciprocates; but as\r\nhe has made this inquiry, and I have answered it before, he has got\r\nit without my getting anything in return. He has got my answer on the\r\nFugitive Slave law.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length; but this is\r\nthe true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution\r\nof slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it; and anything that\r\nargues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the\r\nnegro is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man\r\ncan prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse. I will say here, while\r\nupon this subject, that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to\r\ninterfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists.\r\nI believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do\r\nso. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between\r\nthe white and the black races. There is a physical difference between\r\nthe two which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living\r\ntogether upon the footing of perfect equality; and inasmuch as it becomes\r\na necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas,\r\nam in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I\r\nhave never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding\r\nall this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to\r\nall the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the\r\nright to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as\r\nmuch entitled to these as the white man. I agree with Judge Douglas he\r\nis not my equal in many respects, certainly not in color, perhaps not\r\nin moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread,\r\nwithout the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my\r\nequal, and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.\r\n\r\nNow I pass on to consider one or two more of these little follies.\r\nThe Judge is woefully at fault about his early friend Lincoln being a\r\n\"grocery-keeper.\" I don't know as it would be a great sin, if I had been;\r\nbut he is mistaken. Lincoln never kept a grocery anywhere in the world.\r\nIt is true that Lincoln did work the latter part of one winter in a little\r\nstillhouse, up at the head of a hollow. And so I think my friend the Judge\r\nis equally at fault when he charges me at the time when I was in Congress\r\nof having opposed our soldiers who were fighting in the Mexican war. The\r\nJudge did not make his charge very distinctly, but I can tell you what he\r\ncan prove, by referring to the record. You remember I was an old Whig,\r\nand whenever the Democratic party tried to get me to vote that the war had\r\nbeen righteously begun by the President, I would not do it. But whenever\r\nthey asked for any money, or landwarrants, or anything to pay the soldiers\r\nthere, during all that time, I gave the same vote that Judge Douglas did.\r\nYou can think as you please as to whether that was consistent. Such is the\r\ntruth, and the Judge has the right to make all he can out of it. But when\r\nhe, by a general charge, conveys the idea that I withheld supplies from\r\nthe soldiers who were fighting in the Mexican war, or did anything else\r\nto hinder the soldiers, he is, to say the least, grossly and altogether\r\nmistaken, as a consultation of the records will prove to him.\r\n\r\nAs I have not used up so much of my time as I had supposed, I will dwell\r\na little longer upon one or two of these minor topics upon which the Judge\r\nhas spoken. He has read from my speech in Springfield, in which I say that\r\n\"a house divided against itself cannot stand\" Does the Judge say it can\r\nstand? I don't know whether he does or not. The Judge does not seem to be\r\nattending to me just now, but I would like to know if it is his opinion\r\nthat a house divided against itself can stand. If he does, then there is a\r\nquestion of veracity, not between him and me, but between the Judge and an\r\nAuthority of a somewhat higher character.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, I ask your attention to this matter for the purpose of\r\nsaying something seriously. I know that the Judge may readily enough agree\r\nwith me that the maxim which was put forth by the Savior is true, but he\r\nmay allege that I misapply it; and the Judge has a right to urge that, in\r\nmy application, I do misapply it, and then I have a right to show that I\r\ndo not misapply it, When he undertakes to say that because I think this\r\nnation, so far as the question of slavery is concerned, will all become\r\none thing or all the other, I am in favor of bringing about a dead\r\nuniformity in the various States, in all their institutions, he argues\r\nerroneously. The great variety of the local institutions in the States,\r\nspringing from differences in the soil, differences in the face of the\r\ncountry, and in the climate, are bonds of Union. They do not make \"a house\r\ndivided against itself,\" but they make a house united. If they produce\r\nin one section of the country what is called for, by the wants of another\r\nsection, and this other section can supply the wants of the first, they\r\nare not matters of discord, but bonds of union, true bonds of union. But\r\ncan this question of slavery be considered as among these varieties in\r\nthe institutions of the country? I leave it to you to say whether, in\r\nthe history of our government, this institution of slavery has not always\r\nfailed to be a bond of union, and, on the contrary, been an apple of\r\ndiscord and an element of division in the house. I ask you to consider\r\nwhether, so long as the moral constitution of men's minds shall continue\r\nto be the same, after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the\r\ngrave, and another race shall arise, with the same moral and intellectual\r\ndevelopment we have, whether, if that institution is standing in the same\r\nirritating position in which it now is, it will not continue an element\r\nof division? If so, then I have a right to say that, in regard to this\r\nquestion, the Union is a house divided against itself; and when the Judge\r\nreminds me that I have often said to him that the institution of slavery\r\nhas existed for eighty years in some States, and yet it does not exist in\r\nsome others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at the\r\nposition in which our fathers originally placed it--restricting it from\r\nthe new Territories where it had not gone, and legislating to cut off\r\nits source by the abrogation of the slave trade, thus putting the seal\r\nof legislation against its spread. The public mind did rest in the belief\r\nthat it was in the course of ultimate extinction. But lately, I think--and\r\nin this I charge nothing on the Judge's motives--lately, I think that he,\r\nand those acting with him, have placed that institution on a new basis,\r\nwhich looks to the perpetuity and nationalization of slavery. And while it\r\nis placed upon this new basis, I say, and I have said, that I believe\r\nwe shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery\r\narrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall\r\nrest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or,\r\non the other hand, that its advocates will push it forward until it shall\r\nbecome alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well\r\nas South. Now, I believe if we could arrest the spread, and place it where\r\nWashington and Jefferson and Madison placed it, it would be in the course\r\nof ultimate extinction, and the public mind would, as for eighty years\r\npast, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. The crisis\r\nwould be past, and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years,\r\nif it should live so long, in the States where it exists; yet it would be\r\ngoing out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n[A voice: \"Then do you repudiate popular sovereignty?\"]\r\n\r\nWell, then, let us talk about popular sovereignty! what is popular\r\nsovereignty? Is it the right of the people to have slavery or not have it,\r\nas they see fit, in the Territories? I will state--and I have an able man\r\nto watch me--my understanding is that popular sovereignty, as now applied\r\nto the question of slavery, does allow the people of a Territory to have\r\nslavery if they want to, but does not allow them not to have it if they do\r\nnot want it. I do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were in a\r\nTerritory of the United States, any one of them would be obliged to have a\r\nslave if he did not want one; but I do say that, as I understand the Dred\r\nScott decision, if any one man wants slaves, all the rest have no way of\r\nkeeping that one man from holding them.\r\n\r\nWhen I made my speech at Springfield, of which the Judge complains, and\r\nfrom which he quotes, I really was not thinking of the things which he\r\nascribes to me at all. I had no thought in the world that I was doing\r\nanything to bring about a war between the free and slave states. I had no\r\nthought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a political\r\nand social equality of the black and white races. It never occurred to\r\nme that I was doing anything or favoring anything to reduce to a dead\r\nuniformity all the local institutions of the various States. But I must\r\nsay, in all fairness to him, if he thinks I am doing something which leads\r\nto these bad results, it is none the better that I did not mean it. It\r\nis just as fatal to the country, if I have any influence in producing\r\nit, whether I intend it or not. But can it be true that placing this\r\ninstitution upon the original basis--the basis upon which our fathers\r\nplaced it--can have any tendency to set the Northern and the Southern\r\nStates at war with one another, or that it can have any tendency to\r\nmake the people of Vermont raise sugar-cane, because they raise it in\r\nLouisiana, or that it can compel the people of Illinois to cut pine logs\r\non the Grand Prairie, where they will not grow, because they cut pine\r\nlogs in Maine, where they do grow? The Judge says this is a new principle\r\nstarted in regard to this question. Does the Judge claim that he is\r\nworking on the plan of the founders of government? I think he says in some\r\nof his speeches indeed, I have one here now--that he saw evidence of a\r\npolicy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line, while north of\r\nit it should be excluded, and he saw an indisposition on the part of the\r\ncountry to stand upon that policy, and therefore he set about studying the\r\nsubject upon original principles, and upon original principles he got\r\nup the Nebraska Bill! I am fighting it upon these \"original principles,\"\r\nfighting it in the Jeffersonian, Washingtonian, and Madisonian fashion.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, I wish you to attend for a little while to one or two\r\nother things in that Springfield speech. My main object was to show, so\r\nfar as my humble ability was capable of showing, to the people of this\r\ncountry what I believed was the truth,--that there was a tendency, if not\r\na conspiracy, among those who have engineered this slavery question for\r\nthe last four or five years, to make slavery perpetual and universal in\r\nthis nation. Having made that speech principally for that object, after\r\narranging the evidences that I thought tended to prove my proposition, I\r\nconcluded with this bit of comment:\r\n\r\n\"We cannot absolutely know that these exact adaptations are the result of\r\npreconcert; but when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of\r\nwhich we know have been gotten out at different times and places, and by\r\ndifferent workmen--Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for instance,--and\r\nwhen we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the\r\nframe of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortises exactly fitting,\r\nand all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly\r\nadapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too\r\nfew,--not omitting even the scaffolding,--or if a single piece be lacking,\r\nwe see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring\r\nsuch piece in,--in such a case we feel it impossible not to believe that\r\nStephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood one another from\r\nthe beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn before the\r\nfirst blow was struck.\"\r\n\r\nWhen my friend Judge Douglas came to Chicago on the 9th of July, this\r\nspeech having been delivered on the 16th of June, he made an harangue\r\nthere, in which he took hold of this speech of mine, showing that he had\r\ncarefully read it; and while he paid no attention to this matter at all,\r\nbut complimented me as being a \"kind, amiable, and intelligent gentleman,\"\r\nnotwithstanding I had said this, he goes on and eliminates, or draws out,\r\nfrom my speech this tendency of mine to set the States at war with one\r\nanother, to make all the institutions uniform, and set the niggers and\r\nwhite people to marrying together. Then, as the Judge had complimented me\r\nwith these pleasant titles (I must confess to my weakness), I was a little\r\n\"taken,\" for it came from a great man. I was not very much accustomed to\r\nflattery, and it came the sweeter to me. I was rather like the Hoosier,\r\nwith the gingerbread, when he said he reckoned he loved it better than any\r\nother man, and got less of it. As the Judge had so flattered me, I could\r\nnot make up my mind that he meant to deal unfairly with me; so I went to\r\nwork to show him that he misunderstood the whole scope of my speech, and\r\nthat I really never intended to set the people at war with one another. As\r\nan illustration, the next time I met him, which was at Springfield, I used\r\nthis expression, that I claimed no right under the Constitution, nor had\r\nI any inclination, to enter into the slave States and interfere with the\r\ninstitutions of slavery. He says upon that: Lincoln will not enter into\r\nthe slave States, but will go to the banks of the Ohio, on this side,\r\nand shoot over! He runs on, step by step, in the horse-chestnut style of\r\nargument, until in the Springfield speech he says: \"Unless he shall\r\nbe successful in firing his batteries until he shall have extinguished\r\nslavery in all the States the Union shall be dissolved.\" Now, I don't\r\nthink that was exactly the way to treat \"a kind, amiable, intelligent\r\ngentleman.\" I know if I had asked the Judge to show when or where it was\r\nI had said that, if I didn't succeed in firing into the slave States until\r\nslavery should be extinguished, the Union should be dissolved, he could\r\nnot have shown it. I understand what he would do. He would say: I don't\r\nmean to quote from you, but this was the result of what you say. But I\r\nhave the right to ask, and I do ask now, Did you not put it in such a form\r\nthat an ordinary reader or listener would take it as an expression from\r\nme?\r\n\r\nIn a speech at Springfield, on the night of the 17th, I thought I might as\r\nwell attend to my own business a little, and I recalled his attention as\r\nwell as I could to this charge of conspiracy to nationalize slavery. I\r\ncalled his attention to the fact that he had acknowledged in my hearing\r\ntwice that he had carefully read the speech, and, in the language of the\r\nlawyers, as he had twice read the speech, and still had put in no plea\r\nor answer, I took a default on him. I insisted that I had a right then\r\nto renew that charge of conspiracy. Ten days afterward I met the Judge\r\nat Clinton,--that is to say, I was on the ground, but not in the\r\ndiscussion,--and heard him make a speech. Then he comes in with his plea\r\nto this charge, for the first time; and his plea when put in, as well as I\r\ncan recollect it, amounted to this: that he never had any talk with Judge\r\nTaney or the President of the United States with regard to the Dred Scott\r\ndecision before it was made. I (Lincoln) ought to know that the man who\r\nmakes a charge without knowing it to be true falsifies as much as he who\r\nknowingly tells a falsehood; and, lastly, that he would pronounce the\r\nwhole thing a falsehood; but, he would make no personal application of\r\nthe charge of falsehood, not because of any regard for the \"kind, amiable,\r\nintelligent gentleman,\" but because of his own personal self-respect! I\r\nhave understood since then (but [turning to Judge Douglas] will not hold\r\nthe Judge to it if he is not willing) that he has broken through the\r\n\"self-respect,\" and has got to saying the thing out. The Judge nods to me\r\nthat it is so. It is fortunate for me that I can keep as good-humored as I\r\ndo, when the Judge acknowledges that he has been trying to make a question\r\nof veracity with me. I know the Judge is a great man, while I am only a\r\nsmall man, but I feel that I have got him. I demur to that plea. I waive\r\nall objections that it was not filed till after default was taken, and\r\ndemur to it upon the merits. What if Judge Douglas never did talk with\r\nChief Justice Taney and the President before the Dred Scott decision\r\nwas made, does it follow that he could not have had as perfect an\r\nunderstanding without talking as with it? I am not disposed to stand upon\r\nmy legal advantage. I am disposed to take his denial as being like an\r\nanswer in chancery, that he neither had any knowledge, information, or\r\nbelief in the existence of such a conspiracy. I am disposed to take his\r\nanswer as being as broad as though he had put it in these words. And now,\r\nI ask, even if he had done so, have not I a right to prove it on him, and\r\nto offer the evidence of more than two witnesses, by whom to prove it; and\r\nif the evidence proves the existence of the conspiracy, does his broader\r\nanswer denying all knowledge, information, or belief, disturb the fact?\r\nIt can only show that he was used by conspirators, and was not a leader of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNow, in regard to his reminding me of the moral rule that persons who tell\r\nwhat they do not know to be true falsify as much as those who knowingly\r\ntell falsehoods. I remember the rule, and it must be borne in mind that\r\nin what I have read to you, I do not say that I know such a conspiracy\r\nto exist. To that I reply, I believe it. If the Judge says that I do not\r\nbelieve it, then he says what he does not know, and falls within his\r\nown rule, that he who asserts a thing which he does not know to be true,\r\nfalsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood. I want to call\r\nyour attention to a little discussion on that branch of the case, and the\r\nevidence which brought my mind to the conclusion which I expressed as\r\nmy belief. If, in arraying that evidence I had stated anything which was\r\nfalse or erroneous, it needed but that Judge Douglas should point it out,\r\nand I would have taken it back, with all the kindness in the world. I do\r\nnot deal in that way. If I have brought forward anything not a fact, if he\r\nwill point it out, it will not even ruffle me to take it back. But if he\r\nwill not point out anything erroneous in the evidence, is it not rather\r\nfor him to show, by a comparison of the evidence, that I have reasoned\r\nfalsely, than to call the \"kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman\" a liar?\r\nIf I have reasoned to a false conclusion, it is the vocation of an\r\nable debater to show by argument that I have wandered to an erroneous\r\nconclusion. I want to ask your attention to a portion of the Nebraska\r\nBill, which Judge Douglas has quoted:\r\n\r\n \"It being the true intent and meaning of this Act, not to\r\nlegislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it\r\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon Judge Douglas and others began to argue in favor of \"popular\r\nsovereignty,\" the right of the people to have slaves if they wanted\r\nthem, and to exclude slavery if they did not want them. \"But,\" said,\r\nin substance, a Senator from Ohio (Mr. Chase, I believe), \"we more than\r\nsuspect that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery if\r\nthey wish to; and if you do mean it, accept an amendment which I propose,\r\nexpressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery.\"\r\n\r\nI believe I have the amendment here before me, which was offered, and\r\nunder which the people of the Territory, through their representatives,\r\nmight, if they saw fit, prohibit the existence of slavery therein. And now\r\nI state it as a fact, to be taken back if there is any mistake about it,\r\nthat Judge Douglas and those acting with him voted that amendment down. I\r\nnow think that those men who voted it down had a real reason for doing\r\nso. They know what that reason was. It looks to us, since we have seen the\r\nDred Scott decision pronounced, holding that \"under the Constitution\" the\r\npeople cannot exclude slavery, I say it looks to outsiders, poor, simple,\r\n\"amiable, intelligent gentlemen,\" as though the niche was left as a place\r\nto put that Dred Scott decision in,--a niche which would have been spoiled\r\nby adopting the amendment. And now, I say again, if this was not the\r\nreason, it will avail the Judge much more to calmly and good-humoredly\r\npoint out to these people what that other reason was for voting the\r\namendment down, than, swelling himself up, to vociferate that he may be\r\nprovoked to call somebody a liar.\r\n\r\nAgain: There is in that same quotation from the Nebraska Bill this clause:\r\n\"It being the true intent and meaning of this bill not to legislate\r\nslavery into any Territory or State.\" I have always been puzzled to know\r\nwhat business the word \"State\" had in that connection. Judge Douglas\r\nknows. He put it there. He knows what he put it there for. We outsiders\r\ncannot say what he put it there for. The law they were passing was not\r\nabout States, and was not making provisions for States. What was it placed\r\nthere for? After seeing the Dred Scott decision, which holds that the\r\npeople cannot exclude slavery from a Territory, if another Dred Scott\r\ndecision shall come, holding that they cannot exclude it from a State, we\r\nshall discover that when the word was originally put there, it was in view\r\nof something which was to come in due time, we shall see that it was the\r\nother half of something. I now say again, if there is any different\r\nreason for putting it there, Judge Douglas, in a good-humored way, without\r\ncalling anybody a liar, can tell what the reason was.\r\n\r\nWhen the Judge spoke at Clinton, he came very near making a charge of\r\nfalsehood against me. He used, as I found it printed in a newspaper,\r\nwhich, I remember, was very nearly like the real speech, the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n\"I did not answer the charge [of conspiracy] before, for the reason that\r\nI did not suppose there was a man in America with a heart so corrupt as\r\nto believe such a charge could be true. I have too much respect for Mr.\r\nLincoln to suppose he is serious in making the charge.\"\r\n\r\nI confess this is rather a curious view, that out of respect for me he\r\nshould consider I was making what I deemed rather a grave charge in fun.\r\nI confess it strikes me rather strangely. But I let it pass. As the Judge\r\ndid not for a moment believe that there was a man in America whose heart\r\nwas so \"corrupt\" as to make such a charge, and as he places me among the\r\n\"men in America\" who have hearts base enough to make such a charge, I hope\r\nhe will excuse me if I hunt out another charge very like this; and if it\r\nshould turn out that in hunting I should find that other, and it\r\nshould turn out to be Judge Douglas himself who made it, I hope he will\r\nreconsider this question of the deep corruption of heart he has thought\r\nfit to ascribe to me. In Judge Douglas's speech of March 22, 1858, which I\r\nhold in my hand, he says:\r\n\r\n\"In this connection there is another topic to which I desire to allude.\r\nI seldom refer to the course of newspapers, or notice the articles which\r\nthey publish in regard to myself; but the course of the Washington Union\r\nhas been so extraordinary for the last two or three months, that I think\r\nit well enough to make some allusion to it. It has read me out of the\r\nDemocratic party every other day, at least for two or three months, and\r\nkeeps reading me out, and, as if it had not succeeded, still continues to\r\nread me out, using such terms as 'traitor,' 'renegade,' 'deserter,' and\r\nother kind and polite epithets of that nature. Sir, I have no vindication\r\nto make of my Democracy against the Washington Union, or any other\r\nnewspapers. I am willing to allow my history and action for the last\r\ntwenty years to speak for themselves as to my political principles and\r\nmy fidelity to political obligations. The Washington Union has a personal\r\ngrievance. When its editor was nominated for public printer, I declined\r\nto vote for him, and stated that at some time I might give my reasons for\r\ndoing so. Since I declined to give that vote, this scurrilous abuse, these\r\nvindictive and constant attacks have been repeated almost daily on me.\r\nWill any friend from Michigan read the article to which I allude?\"\r\n\r\nThis is a part of the speech. You must excuse me from reading the entire\r\narticle of the Washington Union, as Mr. Stuart read it for Mr. Douglas.\r\nThe Judge goes on and sums up, as I think, correctly:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, you here find several distinct propositions\r\nadvanced boldly by the Washington Union editorially, and apparently\r\nauthoritatively; and any man who questions any of them is denounced as an\r\nAbolitionist, a Free-soiler, a fanatic. The propositions are, first, that\r\nthe primary object of all government at its original institution is the\r\nprotection of person and property; second, that the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States declares that the citizens of each State shall be entitled\r\nto all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States;\r\nand that, therefore, thirdly, all State laws, whether organic or\r\notherwise, which prohibit the citizens of one State from settling in\r\nanother with their slave property, and especially declaring it forfeited,\r\nare direct violations of the original intention of the government and\r\nConstitution of the United States; and, fourth, that the emancipation of\r\nthe slaves of the Northern States was a gross outrage of the rights of\r\nproperty, inasmuch as it was involuntarily done on the part of the owner.\r\n\r\n\"Remember that this article was published in the Union on the 17th of\r\nNovember, and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion\r\nof the Union, to the Lecompton Constitution. It was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"KANSAS AND HER CONSTITUTION.--The vexed question is settled. The problem\r\nis saved. The dead point of danger is passed. All serious trouble to\r\nKansas affairs is over and gone...\"\r\n\r\nAnd a column nearly of the same sort. Then, when you come to look into\r\nthe Lecompton Constitution, you find the same doctrine incorporated in it\r\nwhich was put forth editorially in the Union. What is it?\r\n\r\n\"ARTICLE 7, Section I. The right of property is before and higher than\r\nany constitutional sanction; and the right of the owner of a slave to such\r\nslave and its increase is the same and as inviolable as the right of the\r\nowner of any property whatever.\"\r\n\r\nThen in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution may be amended\r\nafter 1864 by a two-thirds vote:\r\n\r\n\"But no alteration shall be made to affect the right of property in the\r\nownership of slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton Constitution that they\r\nare identical in spirit with the authoritative article in the Washington\r\nUnion of the day previous to its indorsement of this Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nI pass over some portions of the speech, and I hope that any one who feels\r\ninterested in this matter will read the entire section of the speech, and\r\nsee whether I do the Judge injustice. He proceeds:\r\n\r\n\"When I saw that article in the Union of the 17th of November, followed by\r\nthe glorification of the Lecompton Constitution on the 10th of November,\r\nand this clause in the Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State\r\nhas no right to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there was a\r\nfatal blow being struck at the sovereignty of the States of this Union.\"\r\n\r\nI stop the quotation there, again requesting that it may all be read. I\r\nhave read all of the portion I desire to comment upon. What is this charge\r\nthat the Judge thinks I must have a very corrupt heart to make? It was a\r\npurpose on the part of certain high functionaries to make it impossible\r\nfor the people of one State to prohibit the people of any other State from\r\nentering it with their \"property,\" so called, and making it a slave State.\r\nIn other words, it was a charge implying a design to make the institution\r\nof slavery national. And now I ask your attention to what Judge Douglas\r\nhas himself done here. I know he made that part of the speech as a reason\r\nwhy he had refused to vote for a certain man for public printer; but when\r\nwe get at it, the charge itself is the very one I made against him, that\r\nhe thinks I am so corrupt for uttering. Now, whom does he make that charge\r\nagainst? Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely? No; he\r\nsays it is identical in spirit with the Lecompton Constitution, and so\r\nthe framers of that Constitution are brought in with the editor of\r\nthe newspaper in that \"fatal blow being struck.\" He did not call it a\r\n\"conspiracy.\" In his language, it is a \"fatal blow being struck.\" And if\r\nthe words carry the meaning better when changed from a \"conspiracy\" into a\r\n\"fatal blow being struck,\" I will change my expression, and call it \"fatal\r\nblow being struck.\" We see the charge made not merely against the editor\r\nof the Union, but all the framers of the Lecompton Constitution; and not\r\nonly so, but the article was an authoritative article. By whose authority?\r\nIs there any question but he means it was by the authority of the\r\nPresident and his Cabinet,--the Administration?\r\n\r\nIs there any sort of question but he means to make that charge? Then there\r\nare the editors of the Union, the framers of the Lecompton Constitution,\r\nthe President of the United States and his Cabinet, and all the supporters\r\nof the Lecompton Constitution, in Congress and out of Congress, who\r\nare all involved in this \"fatal blow being struck.\" I commend to Judge\r\nDouglas's consideration the question of how corrupt a man's heart must be\r\nto make such a charge!\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, I have but one branch of the subject, in the little time\r\nI have left, to which to call your attention; and as I shall come to a\r\nclose at the end of that branch, it is probable that I shall not occupy\r\nquite all the time allotted to me. Although on these questions I would\r\nlike to talk twice as long as I have, I could not enter upon another head\r\nand discuss it properly without running over my time. I ask the attention\r\nof the people here assembled and elsewhere to the course that Judge\r\nDouglas is pursuing every day as bearing upon this question of making\r\nslavery national. Not going back to the records, but taking the speeches\r\nhe makes, the speeches he made yesterday and day before, and makes\r\nconstantly all over the country, I ask your attention to them. In the\r\nfirst place, what is necessary to make the institution national? Not\r\nwar. There is no danger that the people of Kentucky will shoulder their\r\nmuskets, and, with a young nigger stuck on every bayonet, march into\r\nIllinois and force them upon us. There is no danger of our going\r\nover there and making war upon them. Then what is necessary for the\r\nnationalization of slavery? It is simply the next Dred Scott decision.\r\nIt is merely for the Supreme Court to decide that no State under the\r\nConstitution can exclude it, just as they have already decided that under\r\nthe Constitution neither Congress nor the Territorial Legislature can do\r\nit. When that is decided and acquiesced in, the whole thing is done. This\r\nbeing true, and this being the way, as I think, that slavery is to be made\r\nnational, let us consider what Judge Douglas is doing every day to that\r\nend. In the first place, let us see what influence he is exerting on\r\npublic sentiment. In this and like communities, public sentiment is\r\neverything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it, nothing\r\ncan succeed. Consequently, he who moulds public sentiment goes deeper\r\nthan he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions. He makes statutes\r\nand decisions possible or impossible to be executed. This must be borne\r\nin mind, as also the additional fact that Judge Douglas is a man of vast\r\ninfluence, so great that it is enough for many men to profess to believe\r\nanything when they once find out Judge Douglas professes to believe it.\r\nConsider also the attitude he occupies at the head of a large party,--a\r\nparty which he claims has a majority of all the voters in the country.\r\nThis man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a Territory\r\nfrom excluding slavery, and he does so, not because he says it is right\r\nin itself,--he does not give any opinion on that,--but because it has been\r\ndecided by the court; and being decided by the court, he is, and you are,\r\nbound to take it in your political action as law, not that he judges at\r\nall of its merits, but because a decision of the court is to him a \"Thus\r\nsaith the Lord.\" He places it on that ground alone; and you will bear in\r\nmind that thus committing himself unreservedly to this decision commits\r\nhim to the next one just as firmly as to this. He did not commit himself\r\non account of the merit or demerit of the decision, but it is a \"Thus\r\nsaith the Lord.\" The next decision, as much as this, will be a \"Thus saith\r\nthe Lord.\" There is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this\r\ndecision. It is nothing that I point out to him that his great prototype,\r\nGeneral Jackson, did not believe in the binding force of decisions. It is\r\nnothing to him that Jefferson did not so believe. I have said that I have\r\noften heard him approve of Jackson's course in disregarding the decision\r\nof the Supreme Court pronouncing a National Bank constitutional. He says I\r\ndid not hear him say so. He denies the accuracy of my recollection. I say\r\nhe ought to know better than I, but I will make no question about this\r\nthing, though it still seems to me that I heard him say it twenty times.\r\nI will tell him, though, that he now claims to stand on the Cincinnati\r\nplatform, which affirms that Congress cannot charter a National Bank, in\r\nthe teeth of that old standing decision that Congress can charter a bank.\r\nAnd I remind him of another piece of history on the question of respect\r\nfor judicial decisions, and it is a piece of Illinois history belonging\r\nto a time when the large party to which Judge Douglas belonged were\r\ndispleased with a decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois, because they\r\nhad decided that a Governor could not remove a Secretary of State. You\r\nwill find the whole story in Ford's History of Illinois, and I know that\r\nJudge Douglas will not deny that he was then in favor of over-slaughing\r\nthat decision by the mode of adding five new judges, so as to vote down\r\nthe four old ones. Not only so, but it ended in the Judge's sitting down\r\non that very bench as one of the five new judges to break down the four\r\nold ones It was in this way precisely that he got his title of judge. Now,\r\nwhen the Judge tells me that men appointed conditionally to sit as members\r\nof a court will have to be catechized beforehand upon some subject, I say,\r\n\"You know, Judge; you have tried it.\" When he says a court of this kind\r\nwill lose the confidence of all men, will be prostituted and disgraced by\r\nsuch a proceeding, I say, \"You know best, Judge; you have been through the\r\nmill.\" But I cannot shake Judge Douglas's teeth loose from the Dred Scott\r\ndecision. Like some obstinate animal (I mean no disrespect) that will hang\r\non when he has once got his teeth fixed, you may cut off a leg, or you may\r\ntear away an arm, still he will not relax his hold. And so I may point out\r\nto the Judge, and say that he is bespattered all over, from the beginning\r\nof his political life to the present time, with attacks upon judicial\r\ndecisions; I may cut off limb after limb of his public record, and strive\r\nto wrench him from a single dictum of the court,--yet I cannot divert him\r\nfrom it. He hangs, to the last, to the Dred Scott decision. These things\r\nshow there is a purpose strong as death and eternity for which he adheres\r\nto this decision, and for which he will adhere to all other decisions of\r\nthe same court.\r\n\r\n[A HIBERNIAN: \"Give us something besides Dred Scott.\"]\r\n\r\nYes; no doubt you want to hear something that don't hurt. Now, having\r\nspoken of the Dred Scott decision, one more word, and I am done. Henry\r\nClay, my beau-ideal of a statesman, the man for whom I fought all my\r\nhumble life, Henry Clay once said of a class of men who would repress all\r\ntendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation that they must, if they\r\nwould do this, go back to the era of our Independence, and muzzle the\r\ncannon which thunders its annual joyous return; they must blow out the\r\nmoral lights around us; they must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate\r\nthere the love of liberty; and then, and not till then, could they\r\nperpetuate slavery in this country! To my thinking, Judge Douglas is, by\r\nhis example and vast influence, doing that very thing in this\r\ncommunity, when he says that the negro has nothing in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Henry Clay plainly understood the contrary. Judge Douglas\r\nis going back to the era of our Revolution, and, to the extent of his\r\nability, muzzling the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return. When\r\nhe invites any people, willing to have slavery, to establish it, he is\r\nblowing out the moral lights around us. When he says he \"cares not\r\nwhether slavery is voted down or up,\"--that it is a sacred right of\r\nself-government,--he is, in my judgment, penetrating the human soul and\r\neradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty in this American\r\npeople. And now I will only say that when, by all these means and\r\nappliances, Judge Douglas shall succeed in bringing public sentiment to\r\nan exact accordance with his own views; when these vast assemblages shall\r\necho back all these sentiments; when they shall come to repeat his views\r\nand to avow his principles, and to say all that he says on these mighty\r\nquestions,--then it needs only the formality of the second Dred Scott\r\ndecision, which he indorses in advance, to make slavery alike lawful in\r\nall the States, old as well as new, North as well as South.\r\n\r\nMy friends, that ends the chapter. The Judge can take his half-hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND JOINT DEBATE, AT FREEPORT,\r\n\r\nAUGUST 27, 1858\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--On Saturday last, Judge Douglas and myself first\r\nmet in public discussion. He spoke one hour, I an hour and a half, and\r\nhe replied for half an hour. The order is now reversed. I am to speak an\r\nhour, he an hour and a half, and then I am to reply for half an hour. I\r\npropose to devote myself during the first hour to the scope of what was\r\nbrought within the range of his half-hour speech at Ottawa. Of course\r\nthere was brought within the scope in that half-hour's speech something\r\nof his own opening speech. In the course of that opening argument Judge\r\nDouglas proposed to me seven distinct interrogatories. In my speech of\r\nan hour and a half, I attended to some other parts of his speech, and\r\nincidentally, as I thought, intimated to him that I would answer the rest\r\nof his interrogatories on condition only that he should agree to answer as\r\nmany for me. He made no intimation at the time of the proposition, nor\r\ndid he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine. I do him no\r\ninjustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing\r\nwith me as though I had refused to answer his interrogatories. I now\r\npropose that I will answer any of the interrogatories, upon condition that\r\nhe will answer questions from me not exceeding the same number. I give him\r\nan opportunity to respond.\r\n\r\nThe Judge remains silent. I now say that I will answer his\r\ninterrogatories, whether he answers mine or not; and that after I have\r\ndone so, I shall propound mine to him.\r\n\r\nI have supposed myself, since the organization of the Republican party at\r\nBloomington, in May, 1856, bound as a party man by the platforms of the\r\nparty, then and since. If in any interrogatories which I shall answer I go\r\nbeyond the scope of what is within these platforms, it will be perceived\r\nthat no one is responsible but myself.\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much, I will take up the Judge's interrogatories as I\r\nfind them printed in the Chicago Times, and answer them seriatim. In order\r\nthat there may be no mistake about it, I have copied the interrogatories\r\nin writing, and also my answers to them. The first one of these\r\ninterrogatories is in these words:\r\n\r\nQuestion 1.--\"I desire to know whether Lincoln to-day stands, as he did\r\nin 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law?\"\r\nAnswer:--I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional\r\nrepeal of the Fugitive Slave law.\r\n\r\nQ. 2.--\"I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as he did\r\nin 1854, against the admission of any more slave States into the Union,\r\neven if the people want them?\" Answer:--I do not now, nor ever did, stand\r\npledged against the admission of any more slave States into the Union.\r\n\r\nQ. 3.--\"I want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of\r\na new State into the Union with such a constitution as the people of that\r\nState may see fit to make?\" Answer:--I do not stand pledged against the\r\nadmission of a new State into the Union, with such a constitution as the\r\npeople of that State may see fit to make.\r\n\r\nQ. 4.--\"I want to know whether he stands to-day pledged to the abolition\r\nof slavery in the District of Columbia?\" Answer:--I do not stand to-day\r\npledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nQ. 5.--\"I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the\r\nprohibition of the slave-trade between the different States?\" Answer:--I\r\ndo not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\nQ. 6.--\"I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in\r\nall the Territories of the United States, north as well as south of the\r\nMissouri Compromise line?\" Answer:--I am impliedly, if not expressly,\r\npledged to a belief in the right and duty of Congress to prohibit slavery\r\nin all the United States 'Territories.\r\n\r\nQ. 7.--\"I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of\r\nany new territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein?\" Answer:--I\r\nam not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory; and, in any\r\ngiven case, I would or would not oppose such acquisition, accordingly as\r\nI might think such acquisition would or would not aggravate the slavery\r\nquestion among ourselves.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, it will be perceived, upon an examination of these\r\nquestions and answers, that so far I have only answered that I was\r\nnot pledged to this, that, or the other. The Judge has not framed his\r\ninterrogatories to ask me anything more than this, and I have answered in\r\nstrict accordance with the interrogatories, and have answered truly, that\r\nI am not pledged at all upon any of the points to which I have answered.\r\nBut I am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory. I\r\nam rather disposed to take up at least some of these questions, and state\r\nwhat I really think upon them.\r\n\r\nAs to the first one, in regard to the Fugitive Slave law, I have never\r\nhesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I think, under\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, the people of the Southern States\r\nare entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law. Having said that,\r\nI have had nothing to say in regard to the existing Fugitive Slave law,\r\nfurther than that I think it should have been framed so as to be free\r\nfrom some of the objections that pertain to it, without lessening its\r\nefficiency. And inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to\r\nan alteration or modification of that law, I would not be the man to\r\nintroduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged to the admission\r\nof any more slave States into the Union, I state to you very frankly that\r\nI would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to\r\npass upon that question. I should be exceedingly glad to know that there\r\nwould never be another slave State admitted into the Union; but I must\r\nadd that if slavery shall be kept out of the Territories during the\r\nterritorial existence of any one given Territory, and then the people\r\nshall, having a fair chance and a clear field, when they come to adopt\r\nthe constitution, do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave\r\nconstitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among\r\nthem, I see no alternative, if we own the country, but to admit them into\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nThe third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second, it being,\r\nas I conceive, the same as the second.\r\n\r\nThe fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia. In relation to that, I have my mind very distinctly made up.\r\nI should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the District of\r\nColumbia. I believe that Congress possesses the constitutional power to\r\nabolish it. Yet as a member of Congress, I should not, with my present\r\nviews, be in favor of endeavoring to abolish slavery in the District\r\nof Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions: First, that the\r\nabolition should be gradual; second, that it should be on a vote of the\r\nmajority of qualified voters in the District; and third, that compensation\r\nshould be made to unwilling owners. With these three conditions, I\r\nconfess I would be exceedingly glad to see Congress abolish slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and, in the language of Henry Clay, \"sweep from our\r\ncapital that foul blot upon our nation.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the fifth interrogatory, I must say here that, as to the\r\nquestion of the abolition of the slave-trade between the different States,\r\nI can truly answer, as I have, that I am pledged to nothing about it.\r\nIt is a subject to which I have not given that mature consideration that\r\nwould make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself\r\nentirely bound by it. In other words, that question has never been\r\nprominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really\r\nhave the constitutional power to do it. I could investigate it if I had\r\nsufficient time to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject; but I\r\nhave not done so, and I say so frankly to you here, and to Judge Douglas.\r\nI must say, however, that if I should be of opinion that Congress does\r\npossess the constitutional power to abolish the slave-trade among the\r\ndifferent States, I should still not be in favor of the exercise of that\r\npower, unless upon some conservative principle as I conceive it, akin to\r\nwhat I have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the District\r\nof Columbia.\r\n\r\nMy answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be prohibited in all\r\nthe Territories of the United States is full and explicit within itself,\r\nand cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine. So I suppose in\r\nregard to the question whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any more\r\nterritory unless slavery is first prohibited therein, my answer is such\r\nthat I could add nothing by way of illustration, or making myself better\r\nunderstood, than the answer which I have placed in writing.\r\n\r\nNow in all this the Judge has me, and he has me on the record. I suppose\r\nhe had flattered himself that I was really entertaining one set of\r\nopinions for one place, and another set for another place; that I was\r\nafraid to say at one place what I uttered at another. What I am\r\nsaying here I suppose I say to a vast audience as strongly tending to\r\nAbolitionism as any audience in the State of Illinois, and I believe I am\r\nsaying that which, if it would be offensive to any persons and render them\r\nenemies to myself, would be offensive to persons in this audience.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to propound to the Judge the interrogatories, so far as I\r\nhave framed them. I will bring forward a new installment when I get them\r\nready. I will bring them forward now only reaching to number four. The\r\nfirst one is:\r\n\r\nQuestion 1.--If the people of Kansas shall, by means entirely\r\nunobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a State constitution, and ask\r\nadmission into the Union under it, before they have the requisite\r\nnumber of inhabitants according to the English bill,--some ninety-three\r\nthousand,--will you vote to admit them?\r\n\r\nQ. 2.--Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way,\r\nagainst the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from\r\nits limits prior to the formation of a State constitution?\r\n\r\nQ. 3. If the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that States\r\ncannot exclude slavery from their limits, are you in favor of acquiescing\r\nin, adopting, and following such decision as a rule of political action?\r\n\r\nQ. 4. Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of\r\nhow such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question?\r\n\r\nAs introductory to these interrogatories which Judge Douglas propounded\r\nto me at Ottawa, he read a set of resolutions which he said Judge Trumbull\r\nand myself had participated in adopting, in the first Republican State\r\nConvention, held at Springfield in October, 1854. He insisted that I and\r\nJudge Trumbull, and perhaps the entire Republican party, were responsible\r\nfor the doctrines contained in the set of resolutions which he read, and\r\nI understand that it was from that set of resolutions that he deduced the\r\ninterrogatories which he propounded to me, using these resolutions as a\r\nsort of authority for propounding those questions to me. Now, I say here\r\nto-day that I do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing\r\nat all from that set of resolutions which he read. I answered them\r\nbecause Judge Douglas thought fit to ask them. I do not now, nor ever did,\r\nrecognize any responsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions. When\r\nI replied to him on that occasion, I assured him that I never had anything\r\nto do with them. I repeat here to today that I never in any possible form\r\nhad anything to do with that set of resolutions It turns out, I believe,\r\nthat those resolutions were never passed in any convention held in\r\nSpringfield.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that they were never passed at any convention or any public\r\nmeeting that I had any part in. I believe it turns out, in addition to all\r\nthis, that there was not, in the fall of 1854, any convention holding a\r\nsession in Springfield, calling itself a Republican State Convention; yet\r\nit is true there was a convention, or assemblage of men calling themselves\r\na convention, at Springfield, that did pass some resolutions. But so\r\nlittle did I really know of the proceedings of that convention, or what\r\nset of resolutions they had passed, though having a general knowledge that\r\nthere had been such an assemblage of men there, that when Judge Douglas\r\nread the resolutions, I really did not know but they had been the\r\nresolutions passed then and there. I did not question that they were the\r\nresolutions adopted. For I could not bring myself to suppose that Judge\r\nDouglas could say what he did upon this subject without knowing that it\r\nwas true. I contented myself, on that occasion, with denying, as I truly\r\ncould, all connection with them, not denying or affirming whether they\r\nwere passed at Springfield. Now, it turns out that he had got hold of some\r\nresolutions passed at some convention or public meeting in Kane County.\r\nI wish to say here, that I don't conceive that in any fair and just mind\r\nthis discovery relieves me at all. I had just as much to do with the\r\nconvention in Kane County as that at Springfield. I am as much responsible\r\nfor the resolutions at Kane County as those at Springfield,--the amount\r\nof the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case; no more than\r\nthere would be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the moon.\r\n\r\nI allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for some further\r\npurpose than anything yet advanced. Judge Douglas did not make his\r\nstatement upon that occasion as matters that he believed to be true,\r\nbut he stated them roundly as being true, in such form as to pledge his\r\nveracity for their truth. When the whole matter turns out as it does, and\r\nwhen we consider who Judge Douglas is, that he is a distinguished Senator\r\nof the United States; that he has served nearly twelve years as such; that\r\nhis character is not at all limited as an ordinary Senator of the United\r\nStates, but that his name has become of world-wide renown,--it is most\r\nextraordinary that he should so far forget all the suggestions of justice\r\nto an adversary, or of prudence to himself, as to venture upon the\r\nassertion of that which the slightest investigation would have shown him\r\nto be wholly false. I can only account for his having done so upon the\r\nsupposition that that evil genius which has attended him through his life,\r\ngiving to him an apparent astonishing prosperity, such as to lead very\r\nmany good men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue over vice,--I\r\nsay I can only account for it on the supposition that that evil genius has\r\nas last made up its mind to forsake him.\r\n\r\nAnd I may add that another extraordinary feature of the Judge's conduct in\r\nthis canvass--made more extraordinary by this incident--is, that he is in\r\nthe habit, in almost all the speeches he makes, of charging falsehood upon\r\nhis adversaries, myself and others. I now ask whether he is able to find\r\nin anything that Judge Trumbull, for instance, has said, or in anything\r\nthat I have said, a justification at all compared with what we have, in\r\nthis instance, for that sort of vulgarity.\r\n\r\nI have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief on my part\r\nthat, in the introduction of the Nebraska Bill into Congress, there was\r\na conspiracy to make slavery perpetual and national. I have arranged from\r\ntime to time the evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this\r\ncharge. I recurred to this charge at Ottawa. I shall not now have time to\r\ndwell upon it at very great length; but inasmuch as Judge Douglas, in\r\nhis reply of half an hour, made some points upon me in relation to it, I\r\npropose noticing a few of them.\r\n\r\nThe Judge insists that, in the first speech I made, in which I very\r\ndistinctly made that charge, he thought for a good while I was in fun!\r\nthat I was playful; that I was not sincere about it; and that he only\r\ngrew angry and somewhat excited when he found that I insisted upon it as\r\na matter of earnestness. He says he characterized it as a falsehood so far\r\nas I implicated his moral character in that transaction. Well, I did\r\nnot know, till he presented that view, that I had implicated his moral\r\ncharacter. He is very much in the habit, when he argues me up into a\r\nposition I never thought of occupying, of very cosily saying he has no\r\ndoubt Lincoln is \"conscientious\" in saying so. He should remember that I\r\ndid not know but what he was ALTOGETHER \"CONSCIENTIOUS\" in that matter.\r\nI can conceive it possible for men to conspire to do a good thing, and\r\nI really find nothing in Judge Douglas's course of arguments that is\r\ncontrary to or inconsistent with his belief of a conspiracy to nationalize\r\nand spread slavery as being a good and blessed thing; and so I hope he\r\nwill understand that I do not at all question but that in all this matter\r\nhe is entirely \"conscientious.\"\r\n\r\nBut to draw your attention to one of the points I made in this case,\r\nbeginning at the beginning: When the Nebraska Bill was introduced, or a\r\nshort time afterward, by an amendment, I believe, it was provided that\r\nit must be considered \"the true intent and meaning of this Act not to\r\nlegislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom,\r\nbut to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate\r\ntheir own domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\" I have called his attention to the\r\nfact that when he and some others began arguing that they were giving\r\nan increased degree of liberty to the people in the Territories over and\r\nabove what they formerly had on the question of slavery, a question was\r\nraised whether the law was enacted to give such unconditional liberty to\r\nthe people; and to test the sincerity of this mode of argument, Mr.\r\nChase, of Ohio, introduced an amendment, in which he made the law--if the\r\namendment were adopted--expressly declare that the people of the Territory\r\nshould have the power to exclude slavery if they saw fit. I have asked\r\nattention also to the fact that Judge Douglas and those who acted with him\r\nvoted that amendment down, notwithstanding it expressed exactly the\r\nthing they said was the true intent and meaning of the law. I have called\r\nattention to the fact that in subsequent times a decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt has been made, in which it has been declared that a Territorial\r\nLegislature has no constitutional right to exclude slavery. And I have\r\nargued and said that for men who did, intend that the people of the\r\nTerritory should have the right to exclude slavery absolutely and\r\nunconditionally, the voting down of Chase's amendment is wholly\r\ninexplicable. It is a puzzle, a riddle. But I have said, that with men who\r\ndid look forward to such a decision, or who had it in contemplation that\r\nsuch a decision of the Supreme Court would or might be made, the voting\r\ndown of that amendment would be perfectly rational and intelligible. It\r\nwould keep Congress from coming in collision with the decision when it was\r\nmade. Anybody can conceive that if there was an intention or expectation\r\nthat such a decision was to follow, it would not be a very desirable party\r\nattitude to get into for the Supreme Court--all or nearly all its members\r\nbelonging to the same party--to decide one way, when the party in Congress\r\nhad decided the other way. Hence it would be very rational for men\r\nexpecting such a decision to keep the niche in that law clear for it.\r\nAfter pointing this out, I tell Judge Douglas that it looks to me as\r\nthough here was the reason why Chase's amendment was voted down. I tell\r\nhim that, as he did it, and knows why he did it, if it was done for a\r\nreason different from this, he knows what that reason was and can tell us\r\nwhat it was. I tell him, also, it will be vastly more satisfactory to the\r\ncountry for him to give some other plausible, intelligible reason why it\r\nwas voted down than to stand upon his dignity and call people liars. Well,\r\non Saturday he did make his answer; and what do you think it was? He\r\nsays if I had only taken upon myself to tell the whole truth about that\r\namendment of Chase's, no explanation would have been necessary on his part\r\nor words to that effect. Now, I say here that I am quite unconscious of\r\nhaving suppressed anything material to the case, and I am very frank to\r\nadmit if there is any sound reason other than that which appeared to me\r\nmaterial, it is quite fair for him to present it. What reason does\r\nhe propose? That when Chase came forward with his amendment expressly\r\nauthorizing the people to exclude slavery from the limits of every\r\nTerritory, General Cass proposed to Chase, if he (Chase) would add to his\r\namendment that the people should have the power to introduce or exclude,\r\nthey would let it go. This is substantially all of his reply. And because\r\nChase would not do that, they voted his amendment down. Well, it turns\r\nout, I believe, upon examination, that General Cass took some part in the\r\nlittle running debate upon that amendment, and then ran away and did not\r\nvote on it at all. Is not that the fact? So confident, as I think, was\r\nGeneral Cass that there was a snake somewhere about, he chose to run away\r\nfrom the whole thing. This is an inference I draw from the fact that,\r\nthough he took part in the debate, his name does not appear in the ayes\r\nand noes. But does Judge Douglas's reply amount to a satisfactory answer?\r\n\r\n[Cries of \"Yes,\" \"Yes,\" and \"No,\" \"No.\"]\r\n\r\nThere is some little difference of opinion here. But I ask attention to\r\na few more views bearing on the question of whether it amounts to a\r\nsatisfactory answer. The men who were determined that that amendment\r\nshould not get into the bill, and spoil the place where the Dred Scott\r\ndecision was to come in, sought an excuse to get rid of it somewhere.\r\nOne of these ways--one of these excuses--was to ask Chase to add to his\r\nproposed amendment a provision that the people might introduce slavery if\r\nthey wanted to. They very well knew Chase would do no such thing, that Mr.\r\nChase was one of the men differing from them on the broad principle of\r\nhis insisting that freedom was better than slavery,--a man who would not\r\nconsent to enact a law, penned with his own hand, by which he was made to\r\nrecognize slavery on the one hand, and liberty on the other, as precisely\r\nequal; and when they insisted on his doing this, they very well knew they\r\ninsisted on that which he would not for a moment think of doing, and that\r\nthey were only bluffing him. I believe (I have not, since he made his\r\nanswer, had a chance to examine the journals or Congressional Globe and\r\ntherefore speak from memory)--I believe the state of the bill at that\r\ntime, according to parliamentary rules, was such that no member could\r\npropose an additional amendment to Chase's amendment. I rather think this\r\nis the truth,--the Judge shakes his head. Very well. I would like to know,\r\nthen, if they wanted Chase's amendment fixed over, why somebody else could\r\nnot have offered to do it? If they wanted it amended, why did they not\r\noffer the amendment? Why did they not put it in themselves? But to put it\r\non the other ground: suppose that there was such an amendment offered,\r\nand Chase's was an amendment to an amendment; until one is disposed of by\r\nparliamentary law, you cannot pile another on. Then all these gentlemen\r\nhad to do was to vote Chase's on, and then, in the amended form in which\r\nthe whole stood, add their own amendment to it, if they wanted to put it\r\nin that shape. This was all they were obliged to do, and the ayes and noes\r\nshow that there were thirty-six who voted it down, against ten who voted\r\nin favor of it. The thirty-six held entire sway and control. They could in\r\nsome form or other have put that bill in the exact shape they wanted. If\r\nthere was a rule preventing their amending it at the time, they could pass\r\nthat, and then, Chase's amendment being merged, put it in the shape they\r\nwanted. They did not choose to do so, but they went into a quibble with\r\nChase to get him to add what they knew he would not add, and because he\r\nwould not, they stand upon the flimsy pretext for voting down what they\r\nargued was the meaning and intent of their own bill. They left room\r\nthereby for this Dred Scott decision, which goes very far to make slavery\r\nnational throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nI pass one or two points I have, because my time will very soon expire;\r\nbut I must be allowed to say that Judge Douglas recurs again, as he\r\ndid upon one or two other occasions, to the enormity of Lincoln, an\r\ninsignificant individual like Lincoln,--upon his ipse dixit charging a\r\nconspiracy upon a large number of members of Congress, the Supreme Court,\r\nand two Presidents, to nationalize slavery. I want to say that, in the\r\nfirst place, I have made no charge of this sort upon my ipse dixit. I have\r\nonly arrayed the evidence tending to prove it, and presented it to the\r\nunderstanding of others, saying what I think it proves, but giving you\r\nthe means of judging whether it proves it or not. This is precisely what\r\nI have done. I have not placed it upon my ipse dixit at all. On this\r\noccasion, I wish to recall his attention to a piece of evidence which\r\nI brought forward at Ottawa on Saturday, showing that he had made\r\nsubstantially the same charge against substantially the same persons,\r\nexcluding his dear self from the category. I ask him to give some\r\nattention to the evidence which I brought forward that he himself had\r\ndiscovered a \"fatal blow being struck\" against the right of the people\r\nto exclude slavery from their limits, which fatal blow he assumed as in\r\nevidence in an article in the Washington Union, published \"by authority.\"\r\nI ask by whose authority? He discovers a similar or identical provision\r\nin the Lecompton Constitution. Made by whom? The framers of that\r\nConstitution. Advocated by whom? By all the members of the party in the\r\nnation, who advocated the introduction of Kansas into the Union under the\r\nLecompton Constitution. I have asked his attention to the evidence that he\r\narrayed to prove that such a fatal blow was being struck, and to the facts\r\nwhich he brought forward in support of that charge,--being identical\r\nwith the one which he thinks so villainous in me. He pointed it, not at\r\na newspaper editor merely, but at the President and his Cabinet and\r\nthe members of Congress advocating the Lecompton Constitution and those\r\nframing that instrument. I must again be permitted to remind him that\r\nalthough my ipse dixit may not be as great as his, yet it somewhat reduces\r\nthe force of his calling my attention to the enormity of my making a like\r\ncharge against him.\r\n\r\nGo on, Judge Douglas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN'S REJOINDER.\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS:--It will readily occur to you that I cannot, in half an hour,\r\nnotice all the things that so able a man as Judge Douglas can say in an\r\nhour and a half; and I hope, therefore, if there be anything that he has\r\nsaid upon which you would like to hear something from me, but which I\r\nomit to comment upon, you will bear in mind that it would be expecting an\r\nimpossibility for me to go over his whole ground. I can but take up some\r\nof the points that he has dwelt upon, and employ my half-hour specially on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I have to say to you is a word in regard to Judge\r\nDouglas's declaration about the \"vulgarity and blackguardism\" in the\r\naudience, that no such thing, as he says, was shown by any Democrat while\r\nI was speaking. Now, I only wish, by way of reply on this subject, to say\r\nthat while I was speaking, I used no \"vulgarity or blackguardism\" toward\r\nany Democrat.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, I come to all this long portion of the Judge's\r\nspeech,--perhaps half of it,--which he has devoted to the various\r\nresolutions and platforms that have been adopted in the different counties\r\nin the different Congressional districts, and in the Illinois legislature,\r\nwhich he supposes are at variance with the positions I have assumed before\r\nyou to-day. It is true that many of these resolutions are at variance\r\nwith the positions I have here assumed. All I have to ask is that we talk\r\nreasonably and rationally about it. I happen to know, the Judge's opinion\r\nto the contrary notwithstanding, that I have never tried to conceal my\r\nopinions, nor tried to deceive any one in reference to them. He may go\r\nand examine all the members who voted for me for United States Senator in\r\n1855, after the election of 1854. They were pledged to certain things here\r\nat home, and were determined to have pledges from me; and if he will find\r\nany of these persons who will tell him anything inconsistent with what I\r\nsay now, I will resign, or rather retire from the race, and give him no\r\nmore trouble. The plain truth is this: At the introduction of the Nebraska\r\npolicy, we believed there was a new era being introduced in the history of\r\nthe Republic, which tended to the spread and perpetuation of slavery. But\r\nin our opposition to that measure we did not agree with one another in\r\neverything. The people in the north end of the State were for stronger\r\nmeasures of opposition than we of the central and southern portions of the\r\nState, but we were all opposed to the Nebraska doctrine. We had that one\r\nfeeling and that one sentiment in common. You at the north end met in your\r\nconventions and passed your resolutions. We in the middle of the State and\r\nfarther south did not hold such conventions and pass the same resolutions,\r\nalthough we had in general a common view and a common sentiment. So that\r\nthese meetings which the Judge has alluded to, and the resolutions he has\r\nread from, were local, and did not spread over the whole State. We at last\r\nmet together in 1886, from all parts of the State, and we agreed upon a\r\ncommon platform. You, who held more extreme notions, either yielded\r\nthose notions, or, if not wholly yielding them, agreed to yield them\r\npractically, for the sake of embodying the opposition to the measures\r\nwhich the opposite party were pushing forward at that time. We met you\r\nthen, and if there was anything yielded, it was for practical purposes. We\r\nagreed then upon a platform for the party throughout the entire State of\r\nIllinois, and now we are all bound, as a party, to that platform.\r\n\r\nAnd I say here to you, if any one expects of me--in case of my\r\nelection--that I will do anything not signified by our Republican platform\r\nand my answers here to-day, I tell you very frankly that person will be\r\ndeceived. I do not ask for the vote of any one who supposes that I have\r\nsecret purposes or pledges that I dare not speak out. Cannot the Judge be\r\nsatisfied? If he fears, in the unfortunate case of my election, that my\r\ngoing to Washington will enable me to advocate sentiments contrary to\r\nthose which I expressed when you voted for and elected me, I assure him\r\nthat his fears are wholly needless and groundless. Is the Judge really\r\nafraid of any such thing? I'll tell you what he is afraid of. He is afraid\r\nwe'll all pull together. This is what alarms him more than anything else.\r\nFor my part, I do hope that all of us, entertaining a common sentiment in\r\nopposition to what appears to us a design to nationalize and perpetuate\r\nslavery, will waive minor differences on questions which either belong\r\nto the dead past or the distant future, and all pull together in this\r\nstruggle. What are your sentiments? If it be true that on the ground which\r\nI occupy--ground which I occupy as frankly and boldly as Judge Douglas\r\ndoes his,--my views, though partly coinciding with yours, are not as\r\nperfectly in accordance with your feelings as his are, I do say to you\r\nin all candor, go for him, and not for me. I hope to deal in all things\r\nfairly with Judge Douglas, and with the people of the State, in this\r\ncontest. And if I should never be elected to any office, I trust I may go\r\ndown with no stain of falsehood upon my reputation, notwithstanding the\r\nhard opinions Judge Douglas chooses to entertain of me.\r\n\r\nThe Judge has again addressed himself to the Abolition tendencies of a\r\nspeech of mine made at Springfield in June last. I have so often tried\r\nto answer what he is always saying on that melancholy theme that I almost\r\nturn with disgust from the discussion,--from the repetition of an answer\r\nto it. I trust that nearly all of this intelligent audience have read\r\nthat speech. If you have, I may venture to leave it to you to inspect\r\nit closely, and see whether it contains any of those \"bugaboos\" which\r\nfrighten Judge Douglas.\r\n\r\nThe Judge complains that I did not fully answer his questions. If I have\r\nthe sense to comprehend and answer those questions, I have done so fairly.\r\nIf it can be pointed out to me how I can more fully and fairly answer him,\r\nI aver I have not the sense to see how it is to be done. He says I do not\r\ndeclare I would in any event vote for the admission of a slave State into\r\nthe Union. If I have been fairly reported, he will see that I did give an\r\nexplicit answer to his interrogatories; I did not merely say that I would\r\ndislike to be put to the test, but I said clearly, if I were put to the\r\ntest, and a Territory from which slavery had been excluded should\r\npresent herself with a State constitution sanctioning slavery,--a most\r\nextraordinary thing, and wholly unlikely to happen,--I did not see how I\r\ncould avoid voting for her admission. But he refuses to understand that I\r\nsaid so, and he wants this audience to understand that I did not say\r\nso. Yet it will be so reported in the printed speech that he cannot help\r\nseeing it.\r\n\r\nHe says if I should vote for the admission of a slave State I would be\r\nvoting for a dissolution of the Union, because I hold that the Union\r\ncannot permanently exist half slave and half free. I repeat that I do not\r\nbelieve this government can endure permanently half slave and half free;\r\nyet I do not admit, nor does it at all follow, that the admission of a\r\nsingle slave State will permanently fix the character and establish this\r\nas a universal slave nation. The Judge is very happy indeed at working up\r\nthese quibbles. Before leaving the subject of answering questions, I aver\r\nas my confident belief, when you come to see our speeches in print, that\r\nyou will find every question which he has asked me more fairly and boldly\r\nand fully answered than he has answered those which I put to him. Is not\r\nthat so? The two speeches may be placed side by side, and I will venture\r\nto leave it to impartial judges whether his questions have not been more\r\ndirectly and circumstantially answered than mine.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas says he made a charge upon the editor of the Washington\r\nUnion, alone, of entertaining a purpose to rob the States of their power\r\nto exclude slavery from their limits. I undertake to say, and I make the\r\ndirect issue, that he did not make his charge against the editor of the\r\nUnion alone. I will undertake to prove by the record here that he made\r\nthat charge against more and higher dignitaries than the editor of the\r\nWashington Union. I am quite aware that he was shirking and dodging around\r\nthe form in which he put it, but I can make it manifest that he leveled\r\nhis \"fatal blow\" against more persons than this Washington editor. Will he\r\ndodge it now by alleging that I am trying to defend Mr. Buchanan against\r\nthe charge? Not at all. Am I not making the same charge myself? I am\r\ntrying to show that you, Judge Douglas, are a witness on my side. I am not\r\ndefending Buchanan, and I will tell Judge Douglas that in my opinion, when\r\nhe made that charge, he had an eye farther north than he has to-day. He\r\nwas then fighting against people who called him a Black Republican and\r\nan Abolitionist. It is mixed all through his speech, and it is tolerably\r\nmanifest that his eye was a great deal farther north than it is to-day.\r\nThe Judge says that though he made this charge, Toombs got up and declared\r\nthere was not a man in the United States, except the editor of the Union,\r\nwho was in favor of the doctrines put forth in that article. And thereupon\r\nI understand that the Judge withdrew the charge. Although he had taken\r\nextracts from the newspaper, and then from the Lecompton Constitution, to\r\nshow the existence of a conspiracy to bring about a \"fatal blow,\" by which\r\nthe States were to be deprived of the right of excluding slavery, it all\r\nwent to pot as soon as Toombs got up and told him it was not true.\r\nIt reminds me of the story that John Phoenix, the California railroad\r\nsurveyor, tells. He says they started out from the Plaza to the Mission\r\nof Dolores. They had two ways of determining distances. One was by a chain\r\nand pins taken over the ground. The other was by a \"go-it-ometer,\"--an\r\ninvention of his own,--a three-legged instrument, with which he computed\r\na series of triangles between the points. At night he turned to the\r\nchain-man to ascertain what distance they had come, and found that by some\r\nmistake he had merely dragged the chain over the ground, without keeping\r\nany record. By the \"go-it-ometer,\" he found he had made ten miles. Being\r\nskeptical about this, he asked a drayman who was passing how far it was to\r\nthe Plaza. The drayman replied it was just half a mile; and the surveyor\r\nput it down in his book,--just as Judge Douglas says, after he had made\r\nhis calculations and computations, he took Toombs's statement. I have\r\nno doubt that after Judge Douglas had made his charge, he was as easily\r\nsatisfied about its truth as the surveyor was of the drayman's statement\r\nof the distance to the Plaza. Yet it is a fact that the man who put forth\r\nall that matter which Douglas deemed a \"fatal blow\" at State sovereignty\r\nwas elected by the Democrats as public printer.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, you may take Judge Douglas's speech of March 22, 1858,\r\nbeginning about the middle of page 21, and reading to the bottom of page\r\n24, and you will find the evidence on which I say that he did not make his\r\ncharge against the editor of the Union alone. I cannot stop to read it,\r\nbut I will give it to the reporters. Judge Douglas said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, you here find several distinct propositions\r\nadvanced boldly by the Washington Union editorially, and apparently\r\nauthoritatively, and every man who questions any of them is denounced as\r\nan Abolitionist, a Free-soiler, a fanatic. The propositions are, first,\r\nthat the primary object of all government at its original institution is\r\nthe protection of persons and property; second, that the Constitution\r\nof the United States declares that the citizens of each State shall be\r\nentitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several\r\nStates; and that, therefore, thirdly, all State laws, whether organic\r\nor otherwise, which prohibit the citizens of one State from settling in\r\nanother with their slave property, and especially declaring it forfeited,\r\nare direct violations of the original intention of the Government and\r\nConstitution of the United States; and, fourth, that the emancipation of\r\nthe slaves of the Northern States was a gross outrage on the rights of\r\nproperty, in as much as it was involuntarily done on the part of the\r\nowner.\r\n\r\n\"Remember that this article was published in the Union on the 17th of\r\nNovember, and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion\r\nof the Union to the Lecompton Constitution. It was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"'KANSAS AND HER CONSTITUTION.--The vexed question is settled. The problem\r\nis solved. The dead point of danger is passed. All serious trouble to\r\nKansas affairs is over and gone....\"\r\n\r\n\"And a column, nearly, of the same sort. Then, when you come to look into\r\nthe Lecompton Constitution, you find the same doctrine incorporated in it\r\nwhich was put forth editorially in the Union. What is it?\r\n\r\n\"'ARTICLE 7, Section i. The right of property is before and higher than\r\nany constitutional sanction; and the right of the owner of a slave to such\r\nslave and its increase is the same and as invariable as the right of the\r\nowner of any property whatever.'\r\n\r\n\"Then in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution may be amended\r\nafter 1864 by a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\n\"'But no alteration shall be made to affect the right of property in the\r\nownership of slaves.'\r\n\r\n\"It will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton Constitution that they\r\nare identical in spirit with this authoritative article in the Washington\r\nUnion of the day previous to its indorsement of this Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"When I saw that article in the Union of the 17th of November, followed by\r\nthe glorification of the Lecompton Constitution on the 18th of November,\r\nand this clause in the Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State\r\nhas no right to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there was a\r\nfatal blow being struck at the sovereignty of the States of this Union.\"\r\n\r\nHere he says, \"Mr. President, you here find several distinct propositions\r\nadvanced boldly, and apparently authoritatively.\" By whose authority,\r\nJudge Douglas? Again, he says in another place, \"It will be seen by these\r\nclauses in the Lecompton Constitution that they are identical in spirit\r\nwith this authoritative article.\" By whose authority,--who do you mean\r\nto say authorized the publication of these articles? He knows that the\r\nWashington Union is considered the organ of the Administration. I demand\r\nof Judge Douglas by whose authority he meant to say those articles were\r\npublished, if not by the authority of the President of the United States\r\nand his Cabinet? I defy him to show whom he referred to, if not to these\r\nhigh functionaries in the Federal Government. More than this, he says the\r\narticles in that paper and the provisions of the Lecompton Constitution\r\nare \"identical,\" and, being identical, he argues that the authors\r\nare co-operating and conspiring together. He does not use the word\r\n\"conspiring,\" but what other construction can you put upon it? He winds\r\nup:\r\n\r\n\"When I saw that article in the Union of the 17th of November, followed by\r\nthe glorification of the Lecompton Constitution on the 18th of November,\r\nand this clause in the Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State\r\nhas no right to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there was a\r\nfatal blow being struck at the sovereignty of the States of this Union.\"\r\n\r\nI ask him if all this fuss was made over the editor of this newspaper. It\r\nwould be a terribly \"fatal blow\" indeed which a single man could strike,\r\nwhen no President, no Cabinet officer, no member of Congress, was giving\r\nstrength and efficiency to the movement. Out of respect to Judge Douglas's\r\ngood sense I must believe he did n't manufacture his idea of the \"fatal\"\r\ncharacter of that blow out of such a miserable scapegrace as he represents\r\nthat editor to be. But the Judge's eye is farther south now. Then, it\r\nwas very peculiarly and decidedly north. His hope rested on the idea of\r\nvisiting the great \"Black Republican\" party, and making it the tail of\r\nhis new kite. He knows he was then expecting from day to day to turn\r\nRepublican, and place himself at the head of our organization. He has\r\nfound that these despised \"Black Republicans\" estimate him by a standard\r\nwhich he has taught them none too well. Hence he is crawling back into his\r\nold camp, and you will find him eventually installed in full fellowship\r\namong those whom he was then battling, and with whom he now pretends to be\r\nat such fearful variance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD JOINT DEBATE, AT JONESBORO,\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 15, 1858\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN'S REPLY.\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--There is very much in the principles that Judge\r\nDouglas has here enunciated that I most cordially approve, and over which\r\nI shall have no controversy with him. In so far as he has insisted that\r\nall the States have the right to do exactly as they please about all their\r\ndomestic relations, including that of slavery, I agree entirely with him.\r\nHe places me wrong in spite of all I can tell him, though I repeat it\r\nagain and again, insisting that I have no difference with him upon this\r\nsubject. I have made a great many speeches, some of which have been\r\nprinted, and it will be utterly impossible for him to find anything that\r\nI have ever put in print contrary to what I now say upon this subject. I\r\nhold myself under constitutional obligations to allow the people in all\r\nthe States, without interference, direct or indirect, to do exactly as\r\nthey please; and I deny that I have any inclination to interfere with\r\nthem, even if there were no such constitutional obligation. I can only say\r\nagain that I am placed improperly--altogether improperly, in spite of all\r\nI can say--when it is insisted that I entertain any other view or purposes\r\nin regard to that matter.\r\n\r\nWhile I am upon this subject, I will make some answers briefly to certain\r\npropositions that Judge Douglas has put. He says, \"Why can't this Union\r\nendure permanently half slave and half free?\" I have said that I supposed\r\nit could not, and I will try, before this new audience, to give briefly\r\nsome of the reasons for entertaining that opinion. Another form of his\r\nquestion is, \"Why can't we let it stand as our fathers placed it?\" That is\r\nthe exact difficulty between us. I say that Judge Douglas and his friends\r\nhave changed it from the position in which our fathers originally placed\r\nit. I say, in the way our father's originally left the slavery question,\r\nthe institution was in the course of ultimate extinction, and the\r\npublic mind rested in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction. I say when this government was first established it was the\r\npolicy of its founders to prohibit the spread of slavery into the new\r\nTerritories of the United States, where it had not existed. But Judge\r\nDouglas and his friends have broken up that policy, and placed it upon\r\na new basis, by which it is to become national and perpetual. All I have\r\nasked or desired anywhere is that it should be placed back again upon the\r\nbasis that the fathers of our government originally placed it upon. I have\r\nno doubt that it would become extinct, for all time to come, if we but\r\nreadopted the policy of the fathers, by restricting it to the limits it\r\nhas already covered, restricting it from the new Territories.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to dwell at great length on this branch of the subject at\r\nthis time, but allow me to repeat one thing that I have stated before.\r\nBrooks--the man who assaulted Senator Sumner on the floor of the\r\nSenate, and who was complimented with dinners, and silver pitchers, and\r\ngold-headed canes, and a good many other things for that feat--in one\r\nof his speeches declared that when this government was originally\r\nestablished, nobody expected that the institution of slavery would last\r\nuntil this day. That was but the opinion of one man, but it was such an\r\nopinion as we can never get from Judge Douglas or anybody in favor of\r\nslavery, in the North, at all. You can sometimes get it from a Southern\r\nman. He said at the same time that the framers of our government did not\r\nhave the knowledge that experience has taught us; that experience and\r\nthe invention of the cotton-gin have taught us that the perpetuation of\r\nslavery is a necessity. He insisted, therefore, upon its being changed\r\nfrom the basis upon which the fathers of the government left it to the\r\nbasis of its perpetuation and nationalization.\r\n\r\nI insist that this is the difference between Judge Douglas and\r\nmyself,--that Judge Douglas is helping that change along. I insist upon\r\nthis government being placed where our fathers originally placed it.\r\n\r\nI remember Judge Douglas once said that he saw the evidences on the\r\nstatute books of Congress of a policy in the origin of government\r\nto divide slavery and freedom by a geographical line; that he saw an\r\nindisposition to maintain that policy, and therefore he set about studying\r\nup a way to settle the institution on the right basis,--the basis which he\r\nthought it ought to have been placed upon at first; and in that speech he\r\nconfesses that he seeks to place it, not upon the basis that the fathers\r\nplaced it upon, but upon one gotten up on \"original principles.\" When he\r\nasks me why we cannot get along with it in the attitude where our fathers\r\nplaced it, he had better clear up the evidences that he has himself\r\nchanged it from that basis, that he has himself been chiefly instrumental\r\nin changing the policy of the fathers. Any one who will read his speech\r\nof the 22d of last March will see that he there makes an open confession,\r\nshowing that he set about fixing the institution upon an altogether\r\ndifferent set of principles. I think I have fully answered him when he\r\nasks me why we cannot let it alone upon the basis where our fathers\r\nleft it, by showing that he has himself changed the whole policy of the\r\ngovernment in that regard.\r\n\r\nNow, fellow-citizens, in regard to this matter about a contract that was\r\nmade between Judge Trumbull and myself, and all that long portion of Judge\r\nDouglas's speech on this subject,--I wish simply to say what I have said\r\nto him before, that he cannot know whether it is true or not, and I do\r\nknow that there is not a word of truth in it. And I have told him so\r\nbefore. I don't want any harsh language indulged in, but I do not know\r\nhow to deal with this persistent insisting on a story that I know to be\r\nutterly without truth. It used to be a fashion amongst men that when a\r\ncharge was made, some sort of proof was brought forward to establish it,\r\nand if no proof was found to exist, the charge was dropped. I don't know\r\nhow to meet this kind of an argument. I don't want to have a fight\r\nwith Judge Douglas, and I have no way of making an argument up into the\r\nconsistency of a corn-cob and stopping his mouth with it. All I can do\r\nis--good-humoredly--to say that, from the beginning to the end of all that\r\nstory about a bargain between Judge Trumbull and myself, there is not a\r\nword of truth in it. I can only ask him to show some sort of evidence\r\nof the truth of his story. He brings forward here and reads from what he\r\ncontends is a speech by James H. Matheny, charging such a bargain between\r\nTrumbull and myself. My own opinion is that Matheny did do some such\r\nimmoral thing as to tell a story that he knew nothing about. I believe he\r\ndid. I contradicted it instantly, and it has been contradicted by Judge\r\nTrumbull, while nobody has produced any proof, because there is none. Now,\r\nwhether the speech which the Judge brings forward here is really the\r\none Matheny made, I do not know, and I hope the Judge will pardon me for\r\ndoubting the genuineness of this document, since his production of those\r\nSpringfield resolutions at Ottawa. I do not wish to dwell at any great\r\nlength upon this matter. I can say nothing when a long story like this is\r\ntold, except it is not true, and demand that he who insists upon it shall\r\nproduce some proof. That is all any man can do, and I leave it in that\r\nway, for I know of no other way of dealing with it.\r\n\r\n[In an argument on the lines of: \"Yes, you did.--No, I did not.\" It bears\r\non the former to prove his point, not on the negative to \"prove\" that he\r\ndid not--even if he easily can do so.]\r\n\r\nThe Judge has gone over a long account of the old Whig and Democratic\r\nparties, and it connects itself with this charge against Trumbull and\r\nmyself. He says that they agreed upon a compromise in regard to the\r\nslavery question in 1850; that in a National Democratic Convention\r\nresolutions were passed to abide by that compromise as a finality upon the\r\nslavery question. He also says that the Whig party in National Convention\r\nagreed to abide by and regard as a finality the Compromise of 1850. I\r\nunderstand the Judge to be altogether right about that; I understand\r\nthat part of the history of the country as stated by him to be correct\r\nI recollect that I, as a member of that party, acquiesced in that\r\ncompromise. I recollect in the Presidential election which followed,\r\nwhen we had General Scott up for the presidency, Judge Douglas was around\r\nberating us Whigs as Abolitionists, precisely as he does to-day,--not a\r\nbit of difference. I have often heard him. We could do nothing when the\r\nold Whig party was alive that was not Abolitionism, but it has got an\r\nextremely good name since it has passed away.\r\n\r\n[It almost a natural law that, when dead--no matter how bad we were--we\r\nare automatically beatified.]\r\n\r\nWhen that Compromise was made it did not repeal the old Missouri\r\nCompromise. It left a region of United States territory half as large\r\nas the present territory of the United States, north of the line of 36\r\ndegrees 30 minutes, in which slavery was prohibited by Act of Congress.\r\nThis Compromise did not repeal that one. It did not affect or propose to\r\nrepeal it. But at last it became Judge Douglas's duty, as he thought (and\r\nI find no fault with him), as Chairman of the Committee on Territories, to\r\nbring in a bill for the organization of a territorial government,--first\r\nof one, then of two Territories north of that line. When he did so, it\r\nended in his inserting a provision substantially repealing the Missouri\r\nCompromise. That was because the Compromise of 1850 had not repealed it.\r\nAnd now I ask why he could not have let that Compromise alone? We were\r\nquiet from the agitation of the slavery question. We were making no fuss\r\nabout it. All had acquiesced in the Compromise measures of 1850. We\r\nnever had been seriously disturbed by any Abolition agitation before that\r\nperiod. When he came to form governments for the Territories north of the\r\nline of 36 degrees 30 minutes, why could he not have let that matter stand\r\nas it was standing? Was it necessary to the organization of a Territory?\r\nNot at all. Iowa lay north of the line, and had been organized as a\r\nTerritory and come into the Union as a State without disturbing that\r\nCompromise. There was no sort of necessity for destroying it to organize\r\nthese Territories. But, gentlemen, it would take up all my time to meet\r\nall the little quibbling arguments of Judge Douglas to show that the\r\nMissouri Compromise was repealed by the Compromise of 1850. My own opinion\r\nis, that a careful investigation of all the arguments to sustain the\r\nposition that that Compromise was virtually repealed by the Compromise of\r\n1850 would show that they are the merest fallacies. I have the report that\r\nJudge Douglas first brought into Congress at the time of the introduction\r\nof the Nebraska Bill, which in its original form did not repeal the\r\nMissouri Compromise, and he there expressly stated that he had forborne to\r\ndo so because it had not been done by the Compromise of 1850. I close this\r\npart of the discussion on my part by asking him the question again, \"Why,\r\nwhen we had peace under the Missouri Compromise, could you not have let it\r\nalone?\"\r\n\r\nIn complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he\r\nsays I accepted my nomination for the senatorship (where, by the way, he\r\nis at fault, for if he will examine it, he will find no acceptance in it),\r\nhe again quotes that portion in which I said that \"a house divided against\r\nitself cannot stand.\" Let me say a word in regard to that matter.\r\n\r\nHe tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different\r\ninstitutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily\r\nproceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face of the country,\r\nand the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all\r\nthat. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us? Not\r\nat all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws\r\nin Louisiana designed to regulate the commerce that springs from the\r\nproduction of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the\r\nproduction of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not\r\nat all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the house\r\na house divided against itself. They are the props that hold up the house\r\nand sustain the Union.\r\n\r\nBut has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had\r\nquarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels\r\nover it? Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe\r\nthat we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question,\r\nand that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the\r\neffort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has been limited to\r\nits present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has\r\nbeen peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to\r\nspread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri\r\nCompromise. It was so again with the annexation of Texas; so with the\r\nterritory acquired by the Mexican war; and it is so now. Whenever there\r\nhas been an effort to spread it, there has been agitation and resistance.\r\nNow, I appeal to this audience (very few of whom are my political\r\nfriends), as national men, whether we have reason to expect that the\r\nagitation in regard to this subject will cease while the causes that tend\r\nto reproduce agitation are actively at work? Will not the same cause that\r\nproduced agitation in 1820, when the Missouri Compromise was formed, that\r\nwhich produced the agitation upon the annexation of Texas, and at other\r\ntimes, work out the same results always? Do you think that the nature of\r\nman will be changed, that the same causes that produced agitation at one\r\ntime will not have the same effect at another?\r\n\r\nThis has been the result so far as my observation of the slavery question\r\nand my reading in history extends. What right have we then to hope that\r\nthe trouble will cease,--that the agitation will come to an end,--until\r\nit shall either be placed back where it originally stood, and where\r\nthe fathers originally placed it, or, on the other hand, until it shall\r\nentirely master all opposition? This is the view I entertain, and this\r\nis the reason why I entertained it, as Judge Douglas has read from my\r\nSpringfield speech.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, there is one other thing that I feel myself under some\r\nsort of obligation to mention. Judge Douglas has here to-day--in a very\r\nrambling way, I was about saying--spoken of the platforms for which he\r\nseeks to hold me responsible. He says, \"Why can't you come out and make\r\nan open avowal of principles in all places alike?\" and he reads from an\r\nadvertisement that he says was used to notify the people of a speech to be\r\nmade by Judge Trumbull at Waterloo. In commenting on it he desires to know\r\nwhether we cannot speak frankly and manfully, as he and his friends do.\r\nHow, I ask, do his friends speak out their own sentiments? A Convention\r\nof his party in this State met on the 21st of April at Springfield, and\r\npassed a set of resolutions which they proclaim to the country as their\r\nplatform. This does constitute their platform, and it is because Judge\r\nDouglas claims it is his platform--that these are his principles and\r\npurposes--that he has a right to declare he speaks his sentiments \"frankly\r\nand manfully.\" On the 9th of June Colonel John Dougherty, Governor\r\nReynolds, and others, calling themselves National Democrats, met\r\nin Springfield and adopted a set of resolutions which are as easily\r\nunderstood, as plain and as definite in stating to the country and to\r\nthe world what they believed in and would stand upon, as Judge Douglas's\r\nplatform Now, what is the reason that Judge Douglas is not willing that\r\nColonel Dougherty and Governor Reynolds should stand upon their own\r\nwritten and printed platform as well as he upon his? Why must he look\r\nfarther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his\r\nplatform?\r\n\r\nAgain, in reference to our platform: On the 16th of June the Republicans\r\nhad their Convention and published their platform, which is as clear and\r\ndistinct as Judge Douglas's. In it they spoke their principles as plainly\r\nand as definitely to the world. What is the reason that Judge Douglas\r\nis not willing I should stand upon that platform? Why must he go around\r\nhunting for some one who is supporting me or has supported me at some\r\ntime in his life, and who has said something at some time contrary to that\r\nplatform? Does the Judge regard that rule as a good one? If it turn out\r\nthat the rule is a good one for me--that I am responsible for any and\r\nevery opinion that any man has expressed who is my friend,--then it is a\r\ngood rule for him. I ask, is it not as good a rule for him as it is for\r\nme? In my opinion, it is not a good rule for either of us. Do you think\r\ndifferently, Judge?\r\n\r\n[Mr. DOUGLAS: I do not.]\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas says he does not think differently. I am glad of it. Then\r\ncan he tell me why he is looking up resolutions of five or six years ago,\r\nand insisting that they were my platform, notwithstanding my protest that\r\nthey are not, and never were my platform, and my pointing out the platform\r\nof the State Convention which he delights to say nominated me for the\r\nSenate? I cannot see what he means by parading these resolutions, if it\r\nis not to hold me responsible for them in some way. If he says to me here\r\nthat he does not hold the rule to be good, one way or the other, I do not\r\ncomprehend how he could answer me more fully if he answered me at greater\r\nlength. I will therefore put in as my answer to the resolutions that he\r\nhas hunted up against me, what I, as a lawyer, would call a good plea to a\r\nbad declaration. I understand that it is an axiom of law that a poor plea\r\nmay be a good plea to a bad declaration. I think that the opinions the\r\nJudge brings from those who support me, yet differ from me, is a bad\r\ndeclaration against me; but if I can bring the same things against him, I\r\nam putting in a good plea to that kind of declaration, and now I propose\r\nto try it.\r\n\r\nAt Freeport, Judge Douglas occupied a large part of his time in producing\r\nresolutions and documents of various sorts, as I understood, to make me\r\nsomehow responsible for them; and I propose now doing a little of the\r\nsame sort of thing for him. In 1850 a very clever gentleman by the name\r\nof Thompson Campbell, a personal friend of Judge Douglas and myself, a\r\npolitical friend of Judge Douglas and opponent of mine, was a candidate\r\nfor Congress in the Galena District. He was interrogated as to his views\r\non this same slavery question. I have here before me the interrogatories,\r\nand Campbell's answers to them--I will read them:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERROGATORIES:\r\n\r\n\"1st. Will you, if elected, vote for and cordially support a bill\r\nprohibiting slavery in the Territories of the United States?\r\n\r\n\"2d. Will you vote for and support a bill abolishing slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia?\r\n\r\n\"3d. Will you oppose the admission of any Slave States which may be formed\r\nout of Texas or the Territories?\r\n\r\n\"4th. Will you vote for and advocate the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law\r\npassed at the recent session of Congress?\r\n\r\n\"5th. Will you advocate and vote for the election of a Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives who shall be willing to organize the committees\r\nof that House so as to give the Free States their just influence in the\r\nbusiness of legislation?\r\n\r\n\"6th. What are your views, not only as to the constitutional right of\r\nCongress to prohibit the slave-trade between the States, but also as to\r\nthe expediency of exercising that right immediately?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPBELL'S REPLY.\r\n\r\n\"To the first and second interrogatories, I answer unequivocally in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n\"To the third interrogatory I reply, that I am opposed to the admission of\r\nany more Slave States into the Union, that may be formed out of Texas or\r\nany other Territory.\r\n\r\n\"To the fourth and fifth interrogatories I unhesitatingly answer in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n\"To the sixth interrogatory I reply, that so long as the Slave States\r\ncontinue to treat slaves as articles of commerce, the Constitution confers\r\npower on Congress to pass laws regulating that peculiar COMMERCE, and that\r\nthe protection of Human Rights imperatively demands the interposition of\r\nevery constitutional means to prevent this most inhuman and iniquitous\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\n\"T. CAMPBELL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to say here that Thompson Campbell was elected to Congress on that\r\nplatform, as the Democratic candidate in the Galena District, against\r\nMartin P. Sweet.\r\n\r\n[Judge DOUGLAS: Give me the date of the letter.]\r\n\r\nThe time Campbell ran was in 1850. I have not the exact date here. It\r\nwas some time in 1850 that these interrogatories were put and the answer\r\ngiven. Campbell was elected to Congress, and served out his term. I think\r\na second election came up before he served out his term, and he was\r\nnot re-elected. Whether defeated or not nominated, I do not know. [Mr.\r\nCampbell was nominated for re-election by the Democratic party, by\r\nacclamation.] At the end of his term his very good friend Judge Douglas\r\ngot him a high office from President Pierce, and sent him off to\r\nCalifornia. Is not that the fact? Just at the end of his term in Congress\r\nit appears that our mutual friend Judge Douglas got our mutual friend\r\nCampbell a good office, and sent him to California upon it. And not only\r\nso, but on the 27th of last month, when Judge Douglas and myself spoke at\r\nFreeport in joint discussion, there was his same friend Campbell, come\r\nall the way from California, to help the Judge beat me; and there was poor\r\nMartin P. Sweet standing on the platform, trying to help poor me to be\r\nelected. That is true of one of Judge Douglas's friends.\r\n\r\nSo again, in that same race of 1850, there was a Congressional Convention\r\nassembled at Joliet, and it nominated R. S. Molony for Congress, and\r\nunanimously adopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we are uncompromisingly opposed to the extension\r\nof slavery; and while we would not make such opposition a ground of\r\ninterference with the interests of the States where it exists, yet we\r\nmoderately but firmly insist that it is the duty of Congress to oppose\r\nits extension into Territory now free, by all means compatible with the\r\nobligations of the Constitution, and with good faith to our sister States;\r\nthat these principles were recognized by the Ordinance of 1787, which\r\nreceived the sanction of Thomas Jefferson, who is acknowledged by all to\r\nbe the great oracle and expounder of our faith.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently the same interrogatories were propounded to Dr. Molony which\r\nhad been addressed to Campbell as above, with the exception of the 6th,\r\nrespecting the interstate slave trade, to which Dr. Molony, the Democratic\r\nnominee for Congress, replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I received the written interrogatories this day, and, as you will see by\r\nthe La Salle Democrat and Ottawa Free Trader, I took at Peru on the 5th,\r\nand at Ottawa on the 7th, the affirmative side of interrogatories 1st and\r\n2d; and in relation to the admission of any more Slave States from Free\r\nTerritory, my position taken at these meetings, as correctly reported in\r\nsaid papers, was emphatically and distinctly opposed to it. In relation\r\nto the admission of any more Slave States from Texas, whether I shall go\r\nagainst it or not will depend upon the opinion that I may hereafter form\r\nof the true meaning and nature of the resolutions of annexation. If, by\r\nsaid resolutions, the honor and good faith of the nation is pledged to\r\nadmit more Slave States from Texas when she (Texas) may apply for the\r\nadmission of such State, then I should, if in Congress, vote for their\r\nadmission. But if not so PLEDGED and bound by sacred contract, then a bill\r\nfor the admission of more Slave States from Texas would never receive my\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n\"To your fourth interrogatory I answer most decidedly in the affirmative,\r\nand for reasons set forth in my reported remarks at Ottawa last Monday.\r\n\r\n\"To your fifth interrogatory I also reply in the affirmative most\r\ncordially, and that I will use my utmost exertions to secure the\r\nnomination and election of a man who will accomplish the objects of said\r\ninterrogatories. I most cordially approve of the resolutions adopted at\r\nthe Union meeting held at Princeton on the 27th September ult.\r\n\r\n\"Yours, etc., R. S. MOLONY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I have to say in regard to Dr. Molony is that he was the regularly\r\nnominated Democratic candidate for Congress in his district; was elected\r\nat that time; at the end of his term was appointed to a land-office at\r\nDanville. (I never heard anything of Judge Douglas's instrumentality\r\nin this.) He held this office a considerable time, and when we were at\r\nFreeport the other day there were handbills scattered about notifying the\r\npublic that after our debate was over R. S. Molony would make a Democratic\r\nspeech in favor of Judge Douglas. That is all I know of my own personal\r\nknowledge. It is added here to this resolution, and truly I believe, that\r\namong those who participated in the Joliet Convention, and who supported\r\nits nominee, with his platform as laid down in the resolution of the\r\nConvention and in his reply as above given, we call at random the\r\nfollowing names, all of which are recognized at this day as leading\r\nDemocrats:\r\n\r\n\"Cook County,--E. B. Williams, Charles McDonell, Arno Voss, Thomas Hoyne,\r\nIsaac Cook.\"\r\n\r\nI reckon we ought to except Cook.\r\n\r\n  \"F. C. Sherman.\r\n  \"Will,--Joel A. Matteson, S. W. Bowen.\r\n  \"Kane,--B. F. Hall, G. W. Renwick, A. M. Herrington, Elijah Wilcox.\r\n  \"McHenry,--W. M. Jackson, Enos W. Smith, Neil Donnelly.\r\n  La Salle,--John Hise, William Reddick.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Reddick! another one of Judge Douglas's friends that stood on the\r\nstand with him at Ottawa, at the time the Judge says my knees trembled so\r\nthat I had to be carried away. The names are all here:\r\n\r\n  \"Du Page,--Nathan Allen.\r\n  \"De Kalb,--Z. B. Mayo.\"\r\n\r\nHere is another set of resolutions which I think are apposite to the\r\nmatter in hand.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of February of the same year a Democratic District Convention\r\nwas held at Naperville to nominate a candidate for Circuit Judge. Among\r\nthe delegates were Bowen and Kelly of Will; Captain Naper, H. H. Cody,\r\nNathan Allen, of Du Page; W. M. Jackson, J. M. Strode, P. W. Platt, and\r\nEnos W. Smith of McHenry; J. Horssnan and others of Winnebago. Colonel\r\nStrode presided over the Convention. The following resolutions were\r\nunanimously adopted,--the first on motion of P. W. Platt, the second on\r\nmotion of William M. Jackson:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That this Convention is in favor of the Wilmot Proviso, both in\r\nPrinciple and Practice, and that we know of no good reason why any person\r\nshould oppose the largest latitude in Free Soil, Free Territory and Free\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That in the opinion of this Convention, the time has arrived\r\nwhen all men should be free, whites as well as others.\"\r\n\r\n[Judge DOUGLAS: What is the date of those resolutions?]\r\n\r\nI understand it was in 1850, but I do not know it. I do not state a thing\r\nand say I know it, when I do not. But I have the highest belief that this\r\nis so. I know of no way to arrive at the conclusion that there is an error\r\nin it. I mean to put a case no stronger than the truth will allow. But\r\nwhat I was going to comment upon is an extract from a newspaper in De Kalb\r\nCounty; and it strikes me as being rather singular, I confess, under the\r\ncircumstances. There is a Judge Mayo in that county, who is a candidate\r\nfor the Legislature, for the purpose, if he secures his election, of\r\nhelping to re-elect Judge Douglas. He is the editor of a newspaper [De\r\nKalb County Sentinel], and in that paper I find the extract I am going to\r\nread. It is part of an editorial article in which he was electioneering\r\nas fiercely as he could for Judge Douglas and against me. It was a curious\r\nthing, I think, to be in such a paper. I will agree to that, and the Judge\r\nmay make the most of it:\r\n\r\n\"Our education has been such that we have been rather in favor of the\r\nequality of the blacks; that is, that they should enjoy all the privileges\r\nof the whites where they reside. We are aware that this is not a very\r\npopular doctrine. We have had many a confab with some who are now strong\r\n'Republicans' we taking the broad ground of equality, and they the\r\nopposite ground.\r\n\r\n\"We were brought up in a State where blacks were voters, and we do not\r\nknow of any inconvenience resulting from it, though perhaps it would not\r\nwork as well where the blacks are more numerous. We have no doubt of\r\nthe right of the whites to guard against such an evil, if it is one. Our\r\nopinion is that it would be best for all concerned to have the colored\r\npopulation in a State by themselves [in this I agree with him]; but if\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States, we say by all means they\r\nshould have the right to have their Senators and Representatives in\r\nCongress, and to vote for President. With us 'worth makes the man, and\r\nwant of it the fellow.' We have seen many a 'nigger' that we thought more\r\nof than some white men.\"\r\n\r\nThat is one of Judge Douglas's friends. Now, I do not want to leave myself\r\nin an attitude where I can be misrepresented, so I will say I do not think\r\nthe Judge is responsible for this article; but he is quite as responsible\r\nfor it as I would be if one of my friends had said it. I think that is\r\nfair enough.\r\n\r\nI have here also a set of resolutions passed by a Democratic State\r\nConvention in Judge Douglas's own good State of Vermont, that I think\r\nought to be good for him too:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That liberty is a right inherent and inalienable in man, and\r\nthat herein all men are equal.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we claim no authority in the Federal Government to abolish\r\nslavery in the several States, but we do claim for it Constitutional power\r\nperpetually to prohibit the introduction of slavery into territory now\r\nfree, and abolish it wherever, under the jurisdiction of Congress, it\r\nexists.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That this power ought immediately to be exercised in\r\nprohibiting the introduction and existence of slavery in New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia, in abolishing slavery and the slave-trade in the District of\r\nColumbia, on the high seas, and wherever else, under the Constitution, it\r\ncan be reached.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That no more Slave States should be admitted into the Federal\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Government ought to return to its ancient policy,\r\nnot to extend, nationalize, or encourage, but to limit, localize, and\r\ndiscourage slavery.\"\r\n\r\nAt Freeport I answered several interrogatories that had been propounded to\r\nme by Judge Douglas at the Ottawa meeting. The Judge has not yet seen fit\r\nto find any fault with the position that I took in regard to those seven\r\ninterrogatories, which were certainly broad enough, in all conscience, to\r\ncover the entire ground. In my answers, which have been printed, and all\r\nhave had the opportunity of seeing, I take the ground that those who elect\r\nme must expect that I will do nothing which will not be in accordance with\r\nthose answers. I have some right to assert that Judge Douglas has no fault\r\nto find with them. But he chooses to still try to thrust me upon different\r\nground, without paying any attention to my answers, the obtaining of\r\nwhich from me cost him so much trouble and concern. At the same time I\r\npropounded four interrogatories to him, claiming it as a right that he\r\nshould answer as many interrogatories for me as I did for him, and I would\r\nreserve myself for a future instalment when I got them ready. The Judge,\r\nin answering me upon that occasion, put in what I suppose he intends\r\nas answers to all four of my interrogatories. The first one of these\r\ninterrogatories I have before me, and it is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Question 1.--If the people of Kansas shall, by means entirely\r\nunobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a State constitution, and ask\r\nadmission into the Union under it, before they have the requisite\r\nnumber of inhabitants according to the English bill,\"--some ninety-three\r\nthousand,--\"will you vote to admit them?\"\r\n\r\nAs I read the Judge's answer in the newspaper, and as I remember it as\r\npronounced at the time, he does not give any answer which is equivalent\r\nto yes or no,--I will or I won't. He answers at very considerable length,\r\nrather quarreling with me for asking the question, and insisting that\r\nJudge Trumbull had done something that I ought to say something about, and\r\nfinally getting out such statements as induce me to infer that he means\r\nto be understood he will, in that supposed case, vote for the admission of\r\nKansas. I only bring this forward now for the purpose of saying that if he\r\nchooses to put a different construction upon his answer, he may do it. But\r\nif he does not, I shall from this time forward assume that he will vote\r\nfor the admission of Kansas in disregard of the English bill. He has the\r\nright to remove any misunderstanding I may have. I only mention it now,\r\nthat I may hereafter assume this to be the true construction of his\r\nanswer, if he does not now choose to correct me.\r\n\r\nThe second interrogatory that I propounded to him was this:\r\n\r\n\"Question 2.--Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful\r\nway, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery\r\nfrom its limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution?\"\r\n\r\nTo this Judge Douglas answered that they can lawfully exclude slavery from\r\nthe Territory prior to the formation of a constitution. He goes on to tell\r\nus how it can be done. As I understand him, he holds that it can be done\r\nby the Territorial Legislature refusing to make any enactments for\r\nthe protection of slavery in the Territory, and especially by adopting\r\nunfriendly legislation to it. For the sake of clearness, I state it again:\r\nthat they can exclude slavery from the Territory, 1st, by withholding\r\nwhat he assumes to be an indispensable assistance to it in the way of\r\nlegislation; and, 2d, by unfriendly legislation. If I rightly understand\r\nhim, I wish to ask your attention for a while to his position.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Supreme Court of the United States has decided\r\nthat any Congressional prohibition of slavery in the Territories is\r\nunconstitutional; that they have reached this proposition as a conclusion\r\nfrom their former proposition, that the Constitution of the United\r\nStates expressly recognizes property in slaves, and from that other\r\nConstitutional provision, that no person shall be deprived of property\r\nwithout due process of law. Hence they reach the conclusion that as the\r\nConstitution of the United States expressly recognizes property in slaves,\r\nand prohibits any person from being deprived of property without due\r\nprocess of law, to pass an Act of Congress by which a man who owned a\r\nslave on one side of a line would be deprived of him if he took him on the\r\nother side, is depriving him of that property without due process of law.\r\nThat I understand to be the decision of the Supreme Court. I understand\r\nalso that Judge Douglas adheres most firmly to that decision; and the\r\ndifficulty is, how is it possible for any power to exclude slavery\r\nfrom the Territory, unless in violation of that decision? That is the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate of the United States, in 1850, Judge Trumbull, in a speech\r\nsubstantially, if not directly, put the same interrogatory to Judge\r\nDouglas, as to whether the people of a Territory had the lawful power to\r\nexclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution. Judge Douglas\r\nthen answered at considerable length, and his answer will be found in the\r\nCongressional Globe, under date of June 9th, 1856. The Judge said that\r\nwhether the people could exclude slavery prior to the formation of a\r\nconstitution or not was a question to be decided by the Supreme Court.\r\nHe put that proposition, as will be seen by the Congressional Globe, in a\r\nvariety of forms, all running to the same thing in substance,--that it was\r\na question for the Supreme Court. I maintain that when he says, after the\r\nSupreme Court have decided the question, that the people may yet exclude\r\nslavery by any means whatever, he does virtually say that it is not a\r\nquestion for the Supreme Court. He shifts his ground. I appeal to you\r\nwhether he did not say it was a question for the Supreme Court? Has not\r\nthe Supreme Court decided that question? when he now says the people may\r\nexclude slavery, does he not make it a question for the people? Does he\r\nnot virtually shift his ground and say that it is not a question for the\r\nCourt, but for the people? This is a very simple proposition,--a very\r\nplain and naked one. It seems to me that there is no difficulty in\r\ndeciding it. In a variety of ways he said that it was a question for the\r\nSupreme Court. He did not stop then to tell us that, whatever the\r\nSupreme Court decides, the people can by withholding necessary \"police\r\nregulations\" keep slavery out. He did not make any such answer I submit\r\nto you now whether the new state of the case has not induced the Judge to\r\nsheer away from his original ground. Would not this be the impression of\r\nevery fair-minded man?\r\n\r\nI hold that the proposition that slavery cannot enter a new country\r\nwithout police regulations is historically false. It is not true at all.\r\nI hold that the history of this country shows that the institution of\r\nslavery was originally planted upon this continent without these \"police\r\nregulations,\" which the Judge now thinks necessary for the actual\r\nestablishment of it. Not only so, but is there not another fact: how came\r\nthis Dred Scott decision to be made? It was made upon the case of a negro\r\nbeing taken and actually held in slavery in Minnesota Territory, claiming\r\nhis freedom because the Act of Congress prohibited his being so held\r\nthere. Will the Judge pretend that Dred Scott was not held there without\r\npolice regulations? There is at least one matter of record as to his\r\nhaving been held in slavery in the Territory, not only without police\r\nregulations, but in the teeth of Congressional legislation supposed to\r\nbe valid at the time. This shows that there is vigor enough in slavery\r\nto plant itself in a new country even against unfriendly legislation. It\r\ntakes not only law, but the enforcement of law to keep it out. That is the\r\nhistory of this country upon the subject.\r\n\r\nI wish to ask one other question. It being understood that the\r\nConstitution of the United States guarantees property in slaves in the\r\nTerritories, if there is any infringement of the right of that property,\r\nwould not the United States courts, organized for the government of the\r\nTerritory, apply such remedy as might be necessary in that case? It is a\r\nmaxim held by the courts that there is no wrong without its remedy; and\r\nthe courts have a remedy for whatever is acknowledged and treated as a\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAgain: I will ask you, my friends, if you were elected members of the\r\nLegislature, what would be the first thing you would have to do before\r\nentering upon your duties? Swear to support the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. Suppose you believe, as Judge Douglas does, that the Constitution\r\nof the United States guarantees to your neighbor the right to hold slaves\r\nin that Territory; that they are his property: how can you clear your\r\noaths unless you give him such legislation as is necessary to enable\r\nhim to enjoy that property? What do you understand by supporting the\r\nConstitution of a State, or of the United States? Is it not to give such\r\nconstitutional helps to the rights established by that Constitution as may\r\nbe practically needed? Can you, if you swear to support the Constitution,\r\nand believe that the Constitution establishes a right, clear your oath,\r\nwithout giving it support? Do you support the Constitution if, knowing\r\nor believing there is a right established under it which needs specific\r\nlegislation, you withhold that legislation? Do you not violate and\r\ndisregard your oath? I can conceive of nothing plainer in the world. There\r\ncan be nothing in the words \"support the Constitution,\" if you may run\r\ncounter to it by refusing support to any right established under the\r\nConstitution. And what I say here will hold with still more force against\r\nthe Judge's doctrine of \"unfriendly legislation.\" How could you, having\r\nsworn to support the Constitution, and believing it guaranteed the right\r\nto hold slaves in the Territories, assist in legislation intended\r\nto defeat that right? That would be violating your own view of the\r\nConstitution. Not only so, but if you were to do so, how long would\r\nit take the courts to hold your votes unconstitutional and void? Not a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would ask: Is not Congress itself under obligation to give\r\nlegislative support to any right that is established under the United\r\nStates Constitution? I repeat the question: Is not Congress itself bound\r\nto give legislative support to any right that is established in the\r\nUnited States Constitution? A member of Congress swears to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States: and if he sees a right established\r\nby that Constitution which needs specific legislative protection, can he\r\nclear his oath without giving that protection? Let me ask you why many of\r\nus who are opposed to slavery upon principle give our acquiescence to a\r\nFugitive Slave law? Why do we hold ourselves under obligations to pass\r\nsuch a law, and abide by it when it is passed? Because the Constitution\r\nmakes provision that the owners of slaves shall have the right to reclaim\r\nthem. It gives the right to reclaim slaves; and that right is, as Judge\r\nDouglas says, a barren right, unless there is legislation that will\r\nenforce it.\r\n\r\nThe mere declaration, \"No person held to service or labor in one State\r\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any\r\nlaw or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but\r\nshall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor\r\nmay be due,\" is powerless without specific legislation to enforce it. Now,\r\non what ground would a member of Congress, who is opposed to slavery in\r\nthe abstract, vote for a Fugitive law, as I would deem it my duty to do?\r\nBecause there is a constitutional right which needs legislation to enforce\r\nit. And although it is distasteful to me, I have sworn to support the\r\nConstitution; and having so sworn, I cannot conceive that I do support\r\nit if I withhold from that right any necessary legislation to make it\r\npractical. And if that is true in regard to a Fugitive Slave law, is\r\nthe right to have fugitive slaves reclaimed any better fixed in the\r\nConstitution than the right to hold slaves in the Territories? For this\r\ndecision is a just exposition of the Constitution, as Judge Douglas\r\nthinks. Is the one right any better than the other? Is there any man who,\r\nwhile a member of Congress, would give support to the one any more than\r\nthe other? If I wished to refuse to give legislative support to slave\r\nproperty in the Territories, if a member of Congress, I could not do it,\r\nholding the view that the Constitution establishes that right. If I did it\r\nat all, it would be because I deny that this decision properly construes\r\nthe Constitution. But if I acknowledge, with Judge Douglas, that this\r\ndecision properly construes the Constitution, I cannot conceive that I\r\nwould be less than a perjured man if I should refuse in Congress to give\r\nsuch protection to that property as in its nature it needed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of what I have said here I propose to give the Judge my fifth\r\ninterrogatory, which he may take and answer at his leisure. My fifth\r\ninterrogatory is this:\r\n\r\nIf the slaveholding citizens of a United States Territory should need\r\nand demand Congressional legislation for the protection of their slave\r\nproperty in such Territory, would you, as a member of Congress, vote for\r\nor against such legislation?\r\n\r\n[Judge DOUGLAS: Will you repeat that? I want to answer that question.]\r\n\r\nIf the slaveholding citizens of a United States Territory should need\r\nand demand Congressional legislation for the protection of their slave\r\nproperty in such Territory, would you, as a member of Congress, vote for\r\nor against such legislation?\r\n\r\nI am aware that in some of the speeches Judge Douglas has made, he has\r\nspoken as if he did not know or think that the Supreme Court had decided\r\nthat a Territorial Legislature cannot exclude slavery. Precisely what the\r\nJudge would say upon the subject--whether he would say definitely that he\r\ndoes not understand they have so decided, or whether he would say he does\r\nunderstand that the court have so decided,--I do not know; but I know\r\nthat in his speech at Springfield he spoke of it as a thing they had not\r\ndecided yet; and in his answer to me at Freeport, he spoke of it, so far,\r\nagain, as I can comprehend it, as a thing that had not yet been decided.\r\nNow, I hold that if the Judge does entertain that view, I think that he\r\nis not mistaken in so far as it can be said that the court has not\r\ndecided anything save the mere question of jurisdiction. I know the legal\r\narguments that can be made,--that after a court has decided that it cannot\r\ntake jurisdiction in a case, it then has decided all that is before it,\r\nand that is the end of it. A plausible argument can be made in favor of\r\nthat proposition; but I know that Judge Douglas has said in one of his\r\nspeeches that the court went forward, like honest men as they were,\r\nand decided all the points in the case. If any points are really\r\nextra-judicially decided, because not necessarily before them, then this\r\none as to the power of the Territorial Legislature, to exclude slavery\r\nis one of them, as also the one that the Missouri Compromise was null and\r\nvoid. They are both extra-judicial, or neither is, according as the\r\ncourt held that they had no jurisdiction in the case between the parties,\r\nbecause of want of capacity of one party to maintain a suit in that court.\r\nI want, if I have sufficient time, to show that the court did pass its\r\nopinion; but that is the only thing actually done in the case. If they did\r\nnot decide, they showed what they were ready to decide whenever the matter\r\nwas before them. What is that opinion? After having argued that Congress\r\nhad no power to pass a law excluding slavery from a United States\r\nTerritory, they then used language to this effect: That inasmuch as\r\nCongress itself could not exercise such a power, it followed as a matter\r\nof course that it could not authorize a Territorial government to exercise\r\nit; for the Territorial Legislature can do no more than Congress could\r\ndo. Thus it expressed its opinion emphatically against the power of a\r\nTerritorial Legislature to exclude slavery, leaving us in just as little\r\ndoubt on that point as upon any other point they really decided.\r\n\r\nNow, my fellow-citizens, I will detain you only a little while longer; my\r\ntime is nearly out. I find a report of a speech made by Judge Douglas\r\nat Joliet, since we last met at Freeport,--published, I believe, in the\r\nMissouri Republican, on the 9th of this month, in which Judge Douglas\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"You know at Ottawa I read this platform, and asked him if he concurred in\r\neach and all of the principles set forth in it. He would not answer these\r\nquestions. At last I said frankly, I wish you to answer them, because when\r\nI get them up here where the color of your principles are a little darker\r\nthan in Egypt, I intend to trot you down to Jonesboro. The very notice\r\nthat I was going to take him down to Egypt made him tremble in his knees\r\nso that he had to be carried from the platform. He laid up seven days, and\r\nin the meantime held a consultation with his political physicians; they\r\nhad Lovejoy and Farnsworth and all the leaders of the Abolition party,\r\nthey consulted it all over, and at last Lincoln came to the conclusion\r\nthat he would answer, so he came up to Freeport last Friday.\"\r\n\r\nNow, that statement altogether furnishes a subject for philosophical\r\ncontemplation. I have been treating it in that way, and I have really come\r\nto the conclusion that I can explain it in no other way than by believing\r\nthe Judge is crazy. If he was in his right mind I cannot conceive how he\r\nwould have risked disgusting the four or five thousand of his own friends\r\nwho stood there and knew, as to my having been carried from the platform,\r\nthat there was not a word of truth in it.\r\n\r\n[Judge DOUGLAS: Did n't they carry you off?]\r\n\r\nThere that question illustrates the character of this man Douglas exactly.\r\nHe smiles now, and says, \"Did n't they carry you off?\" but he said then\r\n\"he had to be carried off\"; and he said it to convince the country that\r\nhe had so completely broken me down by his speech that I had to be carried\r\naway. Now he seeks to dodge it, and asks, \"Did n't they carry you off?\"\r\nYes, they did. But, Judge Douglas, why didn't you tell the truth? I would\r\nlike to know why you did n't tell the truth about it. And then again \"He\r\nlaid up seven days.\" He put this in print for the people of the country to\r\nread as a serious document. I think if he had been in his sober senses he\r\nwould not have risked that barefacedness in the presence of thousands of\r\nhis own friends who knew that I made speeches within six of the seven days\r\nat Henry, Marshall County, Augusta, Hancock County, and Macomb, McDonough\r\nCounty, including all the necessary travel to meet him again at Freeport\r\nat the end of the six days. Now I say there is no charitable way to look\r\nat that statement, except to conclude that he is actually crazy. There is\r\nanother thing in that statement that alarmed me very greatly as he states\r\nit, that he was going to \"trot me down to Egypt.\" Thereby he would have\r\nyou infer that I would not come to Egypt unless he forced me--that I\r\ncould not be got here unless he, giant-like, had hauled me down here. That\r\nstatement he makes, too, in the teeth of the knowledge that I had made the\r\nstipulation to come down here and that he himself had been very reluctant\r\nto enter into the stipulation. More than all this: Judge Douglas, when\r\nhe made that statement, must have been crazy and wholly out of his sober\r\nsenses, or else he would have known that when he got me down here, that\r\npromise--that windy promise--of his powers to annihilate me, would n't\r\namount to anything. Now, how little do I look like being carried away\r\ntrembling? Let the Judge go on; and after he is done with his half-hour, I\r\nwant you all, if I can't go home myself, to let me stay and rot here; and\r\nif anything happens to the Judge, if I cannot carry him to the hotel and\r\nput him to bed, let me stay here and rot. I say, then, here is something\r\nextraordinary in this statement. I ask you if you know any other living\r\nman who would make such a statement? I will ask my friend Casey, over\r\nthere, if he would do such a thing? Would he send that out and have his\r\nmen take it as the truth? Did the Judge talk of trotting me down to Egypt\r\nto scare me to death? Why, I know this people better than he does. I was\r\nraised just a little east of here. I am a part of this people. But the\r\nJudge was raised farther north, and perhaps he has some horrid idea of\r\nwhat this people might be induced to do. But really I have talked about\r\nthis matter perhaps longer than I ought, for it is no great thing; and yet\r\nthe smallest are often the most difficult things to deal with. The Judge\r\nhas set about seriously trying to make the impression that when we meet\r\nat different places I am literally in his clutches--that I am a poor,\r\nhelpless, decrepit mouse, and that I can do nothing at all. This is one\r\nof the ways he has taken to create that impression. I don't know any other\r\nway to meet it except this. I don't want to quarrel with him--to call him\r\na liar; but when I come square up to him I don't know what else to call\r\nhim if I must tell the truth out. I want to be at peace, and reserve all\r\nmy fighting powers for necessary occasions. My time now is very nearly\r\nout, and I give up the trifle that is left to the Judge, to let him set my\r\nknees trembling again, if he can. set my knees trembling again, if he can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAPERS AND WRITINGS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\nVOLUME FOUR\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL EDITION\r\n\r\nBy Abraham Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited by Arthur Brooks Lapsley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, Volume Four\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATES II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND DOUGLAS FOURTH DEBATE, AT CHARLESTON, SEPTEMBER 18, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--It will be very difficult for an audience so large\r\nas this to hear distinctly what a speaker says, and consequently it is\r\nimportant that as profound silence be preserved as possible.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at the hotel to-day, an elderly gentleman called upon me to\r\nknow whether I was really in favor of producing a perfect equality between\r\nthe negroes and white people. While I had not proposed to myself on this\r\noccasion to say much on that subject, yet as the question was asked me I\r\nthought I would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard\r\nto it. I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of\r\nbringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white\r\nand black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making\r\nvoters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor\r\nto intermarry with white people; and I will say, in addition to this, that\r\nthere is a physical difference between the white and black races which\r\nI believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of\r\nsocial and political equality. And in as much as they cannot so live,\r\nwhile they do remain together there must be the position of superior\r\nand inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the\r\nsuperior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion\r\nI do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior\r\nposition the negro should be denied everything. I do not understand that\r\nbecause I do not want a negro woman for a slave I must necessarily want\r\nher for a wife. My understanding is that I can just let her alone. I am\r\nnow in my fiftieth year, and I certainly never have had a black woman for\r\neither a slave or a wife. So it seems to me quite possible for us to get\r\nalong without making either slaves or wives of negroes. I will add to this\r\nthat I have never seen, to my knowledge, a man, woman, or child who was\r\nin favor of producing a perfect equality, social and political, between\r\nnegroes and white men. I recollect of but one distinguished instance\r\nthat I ever heard of so frequently as to be entirely satisfied of its\r\ncorrectness, and that is the case of Judge Douglas's old friend Colonel\r\nRichard M. Johnson. I will also add to the remarks I have made (for I am\r\nnot going to enter at large upon this subject), that I have never had the\r\nleast apprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes if there was\r\nno law to keep them from it; but as Judge Douglas and his friends seem\r\nto be in great apprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep\r\nthem from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very\r\nlast stand by the law of this State which forbids the marrying of white\r\npeople with negroes. I will add one further word, which is this: that I do\r\nnot understand that there is any place where an alteration of the social\r\nand political relations of the negro and the white man can be made, except\r\nin the State Legislature,--not in the Congress of the United States; and\r\nas I do not really apprehend the approach of any such thing myself, and\r\nas Judge Douglas seems to be in constant horror that some such danger is\r\nrapidly approaching, I propose as the best means to prevent it that the\r\nJudge be kept at home, and placed in the State Legislature to fight the\r\nmeasure. I do not propose dwelling longer at this time on this subject.\r\n\r\nWhen Judge Trumbull, our other Senator in Congress, returned to Illinois\r\nin the month of August, he made a speech at Chicago, in which he made what\r\nmay be called a charge against Judge Douglas, which I understand proved to\r\nbe very offensive to him. The Judge was at that time out upon one of his\r\nspeaking tours through the country, and when the news of it reached him,\r\nas I am informed, he denounced Judge Trumbull in rather harsh terms for\r\nhaving said what he did in regard to that matter. I was traveling at that\r\ntime, and speaking at the same places with Judge Douglas on subsequent\r\ndays, and when I heard of what Judge Trumbull had said of Douglas, and\r\nwhat Douglas had said back again, I felt that I was in a position where\r\nI could not remain entirely silent in regard to the matter. Consequently,\r\nupon two or three occasions I alluded to it, and alluded to it in no other\r\nwise than to say that in regard to the charge brought by Trumbull against\r\nDouglas, I personally knew nothing, and sought to say nothing about it;\r\nthat I did personally know Judge Trumbull; that I believed him to be a\r\nman of veracity; that I believed him to be a man of capacity sufficient to\r\nknow very well whether an assertion he was making, as a conclusion drawn\r\nfrom a set of facts, was true or false; and as a conclusion of my own from\r\nthat, I stated it as my belief if Trumbull should ever be called upon,\r\nhe would prove everything he had said. I said this upon two or three\r\noccasions. Upon a subsequent occasion, Judge Trumbull spoke again before\r\nan audience at Alton, and upon that occasion not only repeated his charge\r\nagainst Douglas, but arrayed the evidence he relied upon to substantiate\r\nit. This speech was published at length; and subsequently at Jacksonville\r\nJudge Douglas alluded to the matter. In the course of his speech, and near\r\nthe close of it, he stated in regard to myself what I will now read:\r\n\r\n\"Judge Douglas proceeded to remark that he should not hereafter occupy his\r\ntime in refuting such charges made by Trumbull, but that, Lincoln having\r\nindorsed the character of Trumbull for veracity, he should hold him\r\n(Lincoln) responsible for the slanders.\"\r\n\r\nI have done simply what I have told you, to subject me to this invitation\r\nto notice the charge. I now wish to say that it had not originally been my\r\npurpose to discuss that matter at all But in-as-much as it seems to be the\r\nwish of Judge Douglas to hold me responsible for it, then for once in\r\nmy life I will play General Jackson, and to the just extent I take the\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nI wish to say at the beginning that I will hand to the reporters that\r\nportion of Judge Trumbull's Alton speech which was devoted to this matter,\r\nand also that portion of Judge Douglas's speech made at Jacksonville in\r\nanswer to it. I shall thereby furnish the readers of this debate with the\r\ncomplete discussion between Trumbull and Douglas. I cannot now read them,\r\nfor the reason that it would take half of my first hour to do so. I can\r\nonly make some comments upon them. Trumbull's charge is in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Now, the charge is, that there was a plot entered into to have a\r\nconstitution formed for Kansas, and put in force, without giving the\r\npeople an opportunity to vote upon it, and that Mr. Douglas was in the\r\nplot.\"\r\n\r\nI will state, without quoting further, for all will have an opportunity of\r\nreading it hereafter, that Judge Trumbull brings forward what he regards\r\nas sufficient evidence to substantiate this charge.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived Judge Trumbull shows that Senator Bigler, upon the\r\nfloor of the Senate, had declared there had been a conference among the\r\nsenators, in which conference it was determined to have an enabling act\r\npassed for the people of Kansas to form a constitution under, and in\r\nthis conference it was agreed among them that it was best not to have a\r\nprovision for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people after\r\nit should be formed. He then brings forward to show, and showing, as he\r\ndeemed, that Judge Douglas reported the bill back to the Senate with that\r\nclause stricken out. He then shows that there was a new clause inserted\r\ninto the bill, which would in its nature prevent a reference of the\r\nconstitution back for a vote of the people,--if, indeed, upon a mere\r\nsilence in the law, it could be assumed that they had the right to vote\r\nupon it. These are the general statements that he has made.\r\n\r\nI propose to examine the points in Judge Douglas's speech in which he\r\nattempts to answer that speech of Judge Trumbull's. When you come to\r\nexamine Judge Douglas's speech, you will find that the first point he\r\nmakes is:\r\n\r\n\"Suppose it were true that there was such a change in the bill, and that\r\nI struck it out,--is that a proof of a plot to force a constitution upon\r\nthem against their will?\"\r\n\r\nHis striking out such a provision, if there was such a one in the bill,\r\nhe argues, does not establish the proof that it was stricken out for the\r\npurpose of robbing the people of that right. I would say, in the first\r\nplace, that that would be a most manifest reason for it. It is true, as\r\nJudge Douglas states, that many Territorial bills have passed without\r\nhaving such a provision in them. I believe it is true, though I am not\r\ncertain, that in some instances constitutions framed under such bills\r\nhave been submitted to a vote of the people with the law silent upon the\r\nsubject; but it does not appear that they once had their enabling acts\r\nframed with an express provision for submitting the constitution to be\r\nframed to a vote of the people, then that they were stricken out when\r\nCongress did not mean to alter the effect of the law. That there have been\r\nbills which never had the provision in, I do not question; but when was\r\nthat provision taken out of one that it was in? More especially does the\r\nevidence tend to prove the proposition that Trumbull advanced, when\r\nwe remember that the provision was stricken out of the bill almost\r\nsimultaneously with the time that Bigler says there was a conference among\r\ncertain senators, and in which it was agreed that a bill should be passed\r\nleaving that out. Judge Douglas, in answering Trumbull, omits to attend to\r\nthe testimony of Bigler, that there was a meeting in which it was agreed\r\nthey should so frame the bill that there should be no submission of the\r\nconstitution to a vote of the people. The Judge does not notice this part\r\nof it. If you take this as one piece of evidence, and then ascertain that\r\nsimultaneously Judge Douglas struck out a provision that did require it to\r\nbe submitted, and put the two together, I think it will make a pretty fair\r\nshow of proof that Judge Douglas did, as Trumbull says, enter into a plot\r\nto put in force a constitution for Kansas, without giving the people any\r\nopportunity of voting upon it.\r\n\r\nBut I must hurry on. The next proposition that Judge Douglas puts is this:\r\n\r\n\"But upon examination it turns out that the Toombs bill never did contain\r\na clause requiring the constitution to be submitted.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a mere question of fact, and can be determined by evidence. I only\r\nwant to ask this question: Why did not Judge Douglas say that these words\r\nwere not stricken out of the Toomb's bill, or this bill from which it is\r\nalleged the provision was stricken out,--a bill which goes by the name of\r\nToomb's, because he originally brought it forward? I ask why, if the Judge\r\nwanted to make a direct issue with Trumbull, did he not take the exact\r\nproposition Trumbull made in his speech, and say it was not stricken out?\r\nTrumbull has given the exact words that he says were in the Toomb's bill,\r\nand he alleges that when the bill came back, they were stricken out. Judge\r\nDouglas does not say that the words which Trumbull says were stricken\r\nout were not so stricken out, but he says there was no provision in the\r\nToomb's bill to submit the constitution to a vote of the people. We see at\r\nonce that he is merely making an issue upon the meaning of the words.\r\nHe has not undertaken to say that Trumbull tells a lie about these words\r\nbeing stricken out, but he is really, when pushed up to it, only taking an\r\nissue upon the meaning of the words. Now, then, if there be any issue upon\r\nthe meaning of the words, or if there be upon the question of fact as to\r\nwhether these words were stricken out, I have before me what I suppose to\r\nbe a genuine copy of the Toomb's bill, in which it can be shown that the\r\nwords Trumbull says were in it were, in fact, originally there. If there\r\nbe any dispute upon the fact, I have got the documents here to show\r\nthey were there. If there be any controversy upon the sense of the\r\nwords,--whether these words which were stricken out really constituted a\r\nprovision for submitting the matter to a vote of the people,--as that is a\r\nmatter of argument, I think I may as well use Trumbull's own argument. He\r\nsays that the proposition is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"That the following propositions be and the same are hereby offered to\r\nthe said Convention of the people of Kansas when formed, for their free\r\nacceptance or rejection; which, if accepted by the Convention and ratified\r\nby the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution, shall\r\nbe obligatory upon the United States and the said State of Kansas.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Trumbull alleges that these last words were stricken out of the bill\r\nwhen it came back, and he says this was a provision for submitting the\r\nconstitution to a vote of the people; and his argument is this:\r\n\r\n\"Would it have been possible to ratify the land propositions at the\r\nelection for the adoption of the constitution, unless such an election was\r\nto be held?\"\r\n\r\nThis is Trumbull's argument. Now, Judge Douglas does not meet the charge\r\nat all, but he stands up and says there was no such proposition in that\r\nbill for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people.\r\nTrumbull admits that the language is not a direct provision for submitting\r\nit, but it is a provision necessarily implied from another provision. He\r\nasks you how it is possible to ratify the land proposition at the election\r\nfor the adoption of the constitution, if there was no election to be held\r\nfor the adoption of the constitution. And he goes on to show that it is\r\nnot any less a law because the provision is put in that indirect shape\r\nthan it would be if it were put directly. But I presume I have said enough\r\nto draw attention to this point, and I pass it by also.\r\n\r\nAnother one of the points that Judge Douglas makes upon Trumbull, and at\r\nvery great length, is, that Trumbull, while the bill was pending, said in\r\na speech in the Senate that he supposed the constitution to be made would\r\nhave to be submitted to the people. He asks, if Trumbull thought so then,\r\nwhat ground is there for anybody thinking otherwise now? Fellow-citizens,\r\nthis much may be said in reply: That bill had been in the hands of a\r\nparty to which Trumbull did not belong. It had been in the hands of the\r\ncommittee at the head of which Judge Douglas stood. Trumbull perhaps had a\r\nprinted copy of the original Toomb's bill. I have not the evidence on\r\nthat point except a sort of inference I draw from the general course\r\nof business there. What alterations, or what provisions in the way of\r\naltering, were going on in committee, Trumbull had no means of knowing,\r\nuntil the altered bill was reported back. Soon afterwards, when it was\r\nreported back, there was a discussion over it, and perhaps Trumbull in\r\nreading it hastily in the altered form did not perceive all the bearings\r\nof the alterations. He was hastily borne into the debate, and it does not\r\nfollow that because there was something in it Trumbull did not perceive,\r\nthat something did not exist. More than this, is it true that what\r\nTrumbull did can have any effect on what Douglas did? Suppose Trumbull had\r\nbeen in the plot with these other men, would that let Douglas out of it?\r\nWould it exonerate Douglas that Trumbull did n't then perceive he was in\r\nthe plot? He also asks the question: Why did n't Trumbull propose to\r\namend the bill, if he thought it needed any amendment? Why, I believe that\r\neverything Judge Trumbull had proposed, particularly in connection with\r\nthis question of Kansas and Nebraska, since he had been on the floor of\r\nthe Senate, had been promptly voted down by Judge Douglas and his friends.\r\nHe had no promise that an amendment offered by him to anything on this\r\nsubject would receive the slightest consideration. Judge Trumbull did\r\nbring to the notice of the Senate at that time the fact that there was no\r\nprovision for submitting the constitution about to be made for the people\r\nof Kansas to a vote of the people. I believe I may venture to say that\r\nJudge Douglas made some reply to this speech of Judge Trumbull's, but he\r\nnever noticed that part of it at all. And so the thing passed by. I think,\r\nthen, the fact that Judge Trumbull offered no amendment does not throw\r\nmuch blame upon him; and if it did, it does not reach the question of fact\r\nas to what Judge Douglas was doing. I repeat, that if Trumbull had himself\r\nbeen in the plot, it would not at all relieve the others who were in it\r\nfrom blame. If I should be indicted for murder, and upon the trial it\r\nshould be discovered that I had been implicated in that murder, but that\r\nthe prosecuting witness was guilty too, that would not at all touch\r\nthe question of my crime. It would be no relief to my neck that they\r\ndiscovered this other man who charged the crime upon me to be guilty too.\r\n\r\nAnother one of the points Judge Douglas makes upon Judge Trumbull is, that\r\nwhen he spoke in Chicago he made his charge to rest upon the fact that the\r\nbill had the provision in it for submitting the constitution to a vote\r\nof the people when it went into his Judge Douglas's hands, that it was\r\nmissing when he reported it to the Senate, and that in a public speech he\r\nhad subsequently said the alterations in the bill were made while it was\r\nin committee, and that they were made in consultation between him (Judge\r\nDouglas) and Toomb's. And Judge Douglas goes on to comment upon the fact\r\nof Trumbull's adducing in his Alton speech the proposition that the bill\r\nnot only came back with that proposition stricken out, but with another\r\nclause and another provision in it, saying that \"until the\r\ncomplete execution of this Act there shall be no election in said\r\nTerritory,\"--which, Trumbull argued, was not only taking the provision\r\nfor submitting to a vote of the people out of the bill, but was adding an\r\naffirmative one, in that it prevented the people from exercising the right\r\nunder a bill that was merely silent on the question. Now, in regard\r\nto what he says, that Trumbull shifts the issue, that he shifts his\r\nground,--and I believe he uses the term that, \"it being proven false, he\r\nhas changed ground,\" I call upon all of you, when you come to examine that\r\nportion of Trumbull's speech (for it will make a part of mine), to examine\r\nwhether Trumbull has shifted his ground or not. I say he did not shift his\r\nground, but that he brought forward his original charge and the evidence\r\nto sustain it yet more fully, but precisely as he originally made it.\r\nThen, in addition thereto, he brought in a new piece of evidence. He\r\nshifted no ground. He brought no new piece of evidence inconsistent with\r\nhis former testimony; but he brought a new piece, tending, as he thought,\r\nand as I think, to prove his proposition. To illustrate: A man brings\r\nan accusation against another, and on trial the man making the charge\r\nintroduces A and B to prove the accusation. At a second trial he\r\nintroduces the same witnesses, who tell the same story as before, and a\r\nthird witness, who tells the same thing, and in addition gives further\r\ntestimony corroborative of the charge. So with Trumbull. There was no\r\nshifting of ground, nor inconsistency of testimony between the new piece\r\nof evidence and what he originally introduced.\r\n\r\nBut Judge Douglas says that he himself moved to strike out that last\r\nprovision of the bill, and that on his motion it was stricken out and a\r\nsubstitute inserted. That I presume is the truth. I presume it is true\r\nthat that last proposition was stricken out by Judge Douglas. Trumbull\r\nhas not said it was not; Trumbull has himself said that it was so stricken\r\nout. He says: \"I am now speaking of the bill as Judge Douglas reported\r\nit back. It was amended somewhat in the Senate before it passed, but I am\r\nspeaking of it as he brought it back.\" Now, when Judge Douglas parades the\r\nfact that the provision was stricken out of the bill when it came back, he\r\nasserts nothing contrary to what Trumbull alleges. Trumbull has only said\r\nthat he originally put it in, not that he did not strike it out. Trumbull\r\nsays it was not in the bill when it went to the committee. When it came\r\nback it was in, and Judge Douglas said the alterations were made by him in\r\nconsultation with Toomb's. Trumbull alleges, therefore, as his conclusion,\r\nthat Judge Douglas put it in. Then, if Douglas wants to contradict\r\nTrumbull and call him a liar, let him say he did not put it in, and not\r\nthat he did n't take it out again. It is said that a bear is sometimes\r\nhard enough pushed to drop a cub; and so I presume it was in this case.\r\nI presume the truth is that Douglas put it in, and afterward took it out.\r\nThat, I take it, is the truth about it. Judge Trumbull says one thing,\r\nDouglas says another thing, and the two don't contradict one another at\r\nall. The question is, what did he put it in for? In the first place, what\r\ndid he take the other provision out of the bill for,--the provision which\r\nTrumbull argued was necessary for submitting the constitution to a vote of\r\nthe people? What did he take that out for; and, having taken it out, what\r\ndid he put this in for? I say that in the run of things it is not unlikely\r\nforces conspire to render it vastly expedient for Judge Douglas to take\r\nthat latter clause out again. The question that Trumbull has made is\r\nthat Judge Douglas put it in; and he don't meet Trumbull at all unless he\r\ndenies that.\r\n\r\nIn the clause of Judge Douglas's speech upon this subject he uses this\r\nlanguage toward Judge Trumbull. He says:\r\n\r\n\"He forges his evidence from beginning to end; and by falsifying the\r\nrecord, he endeavors to bolster up his false charge.\"\r\n\r\nWell, that is a pretty serious statement--Trumbull forges his evidence\r\nfrom beginning to end. Now, upon my own authority I say that it is not\r\ntrue. What is a forgery? Consider the evidence that Trumbull has brought\r\nforward. When you come to read the speech, as you will be able to, examine\r\nwhether the evidence is a forgery from beginning to end. He had the bill\r\nor document in his hand like that [holding up a paper]. He says that is a\r\ncopy of the Toomb's bill,--the amendment offered by Toomb's. He says that\r\nis a copy of the bill as it was introduced and went into Judge Douglas's\r\nhands. Now, does Judge Douglas say that is a forgery? That is one thing\r\nTrumbull brought forward. Judge Douglas says he forged it from beginning\r\nto end! That is the \"beginning,\" we will say. Does Douglas say that is a\r\nforgery? Let him say it to-day, and we will have a subsequent examination\r\nupon this subject. Trumbull then holds up another document like this, and\r\nsays that is an exact copy of the bill as it came back in the amended form\r\nout of Judge Douglas's hands. Does Judge Douglas say that is a forgery?\r\nDoes he say it in his general sweeping charge? Does he say so now? If he\r\ndoes not, then take this Toomb's bill and the bill in the amended form,\r\nand it only needs to compare them to see that the provision is in the one\r\nand not in the other; it leaves the inference inevitable that it was taken\r\nout.\r\n\r\nBut, while I am dealing with this question, let us see what Trumbull's\r\nother evidence is. One other piece of evidence I will read. Trumbull says\r\nthere are in this original Toomb's bill these words:\r\n\r\n\"That the following propositions be and the same are hereby offered to\r\nthe said Convention of the people of Kansas, when formed, for their free\r\nacceptance or rejection; which, if accepted by the Convention and ratified\r\nby the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution, shall\r\nbe obligatory upon the United States and the said State of Kansas.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if it is said that this is a forgery, we will open the paper here and\r\nsee whether it is or not. Again, Trumbull says, as he goes along, that Mr.\r\nBigler made the following statement in his place in the Senate, December\r\n9, 1857:\r\n\r\n\"I was present when that subject was discussed by senators before the bill\r\nwas introduced, and the question was raised and discussed, whether the\r\nconstitution, when formed, should be submitted to a vote of the people. It\r\nwas held by those most intelligent on the subject that, in view of all the\r\ndifficulties surrounding that Territory, the danger of any experiment at\r\nthat time of a popular vote, it would be better there should be no such\r\nprovision in the Toomb's bill; and it was my understanding, in all the\r\nintercourse I had, that the Convention would make a constitution, and send\r\nit here, without submitting it to the popular vote.\"\r\n\r\nThen Trumbull follows on:\r\n\r\n\"In speaking of this meeting again on the 21st December, 1857\r\n[Congressional Globe, same vol., page 113], Senator Bigler said:\r\n\r\n\"'Nothing was further from my mind than to allude to any social or\r\nconfidential interview. The meeting was not of that character. Indeed, it\r\nwas semi-official, and called to promote the public good. My recollection\r\nwas clear that I left the conference under the impression that it had\r\nbeen deemed best to adopt measures to admit Kansas as a State through the\r\nagency of one popular election, and that for delegates to this Convention.\r\nThis impression was stronger because I thought the spirit of the bill\r\ninfringed upon the doctrine of non-intervention, to which I had great\r\naversion; but with the hope of accomplishing a great good, and as no\r\nmovement had been made in that direction in the Territory, I waived this\r\nobjection, and concluded to support the measure. I have a few items of\r\ntestimony as to the correctness of these impressions, and with their\r\nsubmission I shall be content. I have before me the bill reported by\r\nthe senator from Illinois on the 7th of March, 1856, providing for the\r\nadmission of Kansas as a State, the third section of which reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"That the following propositions be, and the same are hereby offered to\r\nthe said Convention of the people of Kansas, when formed, for their free\r\nacceptance or rejection; which, if accepted by the Convention and ratified\r\nby the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution, shall\r\nbe obligatory upon the United States and the said State of Kansas.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill read in his place by the senator from Georgia on the 25th of\r\nJune, and referred to the Committee on Territories, contained the same\r\nsection word for word. Both these bills were under consideration at the\r\nconference referred to; but, sir, when the senator from Illinois reported\r\nthe Toombs bill to the Senate with amendments, the next morning, it did\r\nnot contain that portion of the third section which indicated to the\r\nConvention that the constitution should be approved by the people. The\r\nwords \"and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the\r\nconstitution\" had been stricken out.\r\n\r\nNow, these things Trumbull says were stated by Bigler upon the floor\r\nof the Senate on certain days, and that they are recorded in the\r\nCongressional Globe on certain pages. Does Judge Douglas say this is a\r\nforgery? Does he say there is no such thing in the Congressional Globe?\r\nWhat does he mean when he says Judge Trumbull forges his evidence from\r\nbeginning to end? So again he says in another place that Judge Douglas,\r\nin his speech, December 9, 1857 (Congressional Globe, part I., page 15),\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n\"That during the last session of Congress, I [Mr. Douglas] reported a bill\r\nfrom the Committee on Territories, to authorize the people of Kansas to\r\nassemble and form a constitution for themselves. Subsequently the senator\r\nfrom Georgia [Mr. Toombs] brought forward a substitute for my bill, which,\r\nafter having been modified by him and myself in consultation, was passed\r\nby the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Trumbull says this is a quotation from a speech of Douglas, and is\r\nrecorded in the Congressional Globe. Is it a forgery? Is it there or\r\nnot? It may not be there, but I want the Judge to take these pieces of\r\nevidence, and distinctly say they are forgeries if he dare do it.\r\n\r\n[A voice: \"He will.\"]\r\n\r\nWell, sir, you had better not commit him. He gives other\r\nquotations,--another from Judge Douglas. He says:\r\n\r\n\"I will ask the senator to show me an intimation, from any one member of\r\nthe Senate, in the whole debate on the Toombs bill, and in the Union, from\r\nany quarter, that the constitution was not to be submitted to the\r\npeople. I will venture to say that on all sides of the chamber it was so\r\nunderstood at the time. If the opponents of the bill had understood it\r\nwas not, they would have made the point on it; and if they had made it,\r\nwe should certainly have yielded to it, and put in the clause. That is a\r\ndiscovery made since the President found out that it was not safe to take\r\nit for granted that that would be done, which ought in fairness to have\r\nbeen done.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Trumbull says Douglas made that speech, and it is recorded. Does\r\nJudge Douglas say it is a forgery, and was not true? Trumbull says\r\nsomewhere, and I propose to skip it, but it will be found by any one who\r\nwill read this debate, that he did distinctly bring it to the notice of\r\nthose who were engineering the bill, that it lacked that provision; and\r\nthen he goes on to give another quotation from Judge Douglas, where Judge\r\nTrumbull uses this language:\r\n\r\n\"Judge Douglas, however, on the same day and in the same debate, probably\r\nrecollecting or being reminded of the fact that I had objected to the\r\nToombs bill when pending that it did not provide for a submission of the\r\nconstitution to the people, made another statement, which is to be found\r\nin the same volume of the Globe, page 22, in which he says: 'That the bill\r\nwas silent on this subject was true, and my attention was called to that\r\nabout the time it was passed; and I took the fair construction to be, that\r\npowers not delegated were reserved, and that of course the constitution\r\nwould be submitted to the people.'\r\n\r\n\"Whether this statement is consistent with the statement just before made,\r\nthat had the point been made it would have been yielded to, or that it was\r\na new discovery, you will determine.\"\r\n\r\nSo I say. I do not know whether Judge Douglas will dispute this, and yet\r\nmaintain his position that Trumbull's evidence \"was forged from beginning\r\nto end.\" I will remark that I have not got these Congressional Globes\r\nwith me. They are large books, and difficult to carry about, and if Judge\r\nDouglas shall say that on these points where Trumbull has quoted from them\r\nthere are no such passages there, I shall not be able to prove they are\r\nthere upon this occasion, but I will have another chance. Whenever he\r\npoints out the forgery and says, \"I declare that this particular thing\r\nwhich Trumbull has uttered is not to be found where he says it is,\" then\r\nmy attention will be drawn to that, and I will arm myself for the contest,\r\nstating now that I have not the slightest doubt on earth that I will find\r\nevery quotation just where Trumbull says it is. Then the question is, How\r\ncan Douglas call that a forgery? How can he make out that it is a forgery?\r\nWhat is a forgery? It is the bringing forward something in writing or in\r\nprint purporting to be of certain effect when it is altogether untrue. If\r\nyou come forward with my note for one hundred dollars when I have never\r\ngiven such a note, there is a forgery. If you come forward with a letter\r\npurporting to be written by me which I never wrote, there is another\r\nforgery. If you produce anything in writing or in print saying it is so\r\nand so, the document not being genuine, a forgery has been committed. How\r\ndo you make this forgery when every piece of the evidence is genuine?\r\nIf Judge Douglas does say these documents and quotations are false and\r\nforged, he has a full right to do so; but until he does it specifically,\r\nwe don't know how to get at him. If he does say they are false and\r\nforged, I will then look further into it, and presume I can procure the\r\ncertificates of the proper officers that they are genuine copies. I have\r\nno doubt each of these extracts will be found exactly where Trumbull says\r\nit is. Then I leave it to you if Judge Douglas, in making his sweeping\r\ncharge that Judge Trumbull's evidence is forged from beginning to end,\r\nat all meets the case,--if that is the way to get at the facts. I repeat\r\nagain, if he will point out which one is a forgery, I will carefully\r\nexamine it, and if it proves that any one of them is really a forgery,\r\nit will not be me who will hold to it any longer. I have always wanted\r\nto deal with everyone I meet candidly and honestly. If I have made any\r\nassertion not warranted by facts, and it is pointed out to me, I will\r\nwithdraw it cheerfully. But I do not choose to see Judge Trumbull\r\ncalumniated, and the evidence he has brought forward branded in general\r\nterms \"a forgery from beginning to end.\" This is not the legal way of\r\nmeeting a charge, and I submit it to all intelligent persons, both friends\r\nof Judge Douglas and of myself, whether it is.\r\n\r\nThe point upon Judge Douglas is this: The bill that went into his hands\r\nhad the provision in it for a submission of the constitution to the\r\npeople; and I say its language amounts to an express provision for a\r\nsubmission, and that he took the provision out. He says it was known that\r\nthe bill was silent in this particular; but I say, Judge Douglas, it was\r\nnot silent when you got it. It was vocal with the declaration, when you\r\ngot it, for a submission of the constitution to the people. And now, my\r\ndirect question to Judge Douglas is, to answer why, if he deemed the bill\r\nsilent on this point, he found it necessary to strike out those particular\r\nharmless words. If he had found the bill silent and without this\r\nprovision, he might say what he does now. If he supposes it was implied\r\nthat the constitution would be submitted to a vote of the people, how\r\ncould these two lines so encumber the statute as to make it necessary to\r\nstrike them out? How could he infer that a submission was still implied,\r\nafter its express provision had been stricken from the bill? I find the\r\nbill vocal with the provision, while he silenced it. He took it out, and\r\nalthough he took out the other provision preventing a submission to a vote\r\nof the people, I ask, Why did you first put it in? I ask him whether he\r\ntook the original provision out, which Trumbull alleges was in the bill.\r\nIf he admits that he did take it, I ask him what he did it for. It looks\r\nto us as if he had altered the bill. If it looks differently to him,--if\r\nhe has a different reason for his action from the one we assign him--he\r\ncan tell it. I insist upon knowing why he made the bill silent upon that\r\npoint when it was vocal before he put his hands upon it.\r\n\r\nI was told, before my last paragraph, that my time was within three\r\nminutes of being out. I presume it is expired now; I therefore close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN'S REJOINDER.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: It follows as a matter of course that a half-hour answer\r\nto a speech of an hour and a half can be but a very hurried one. I shall\r\nonly be able to touch upon a few of the points suggested by Judge Douglas,\r\nand give them a brief attention, while I shall have to totally omit others\r\nfor the want of time.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas has said to you that he has not been able to get from me an\r\nanswer to the question whether I am in favor of negro citizenship. So far\r\nas I know the Judge never asked me the question before. He shall have no\r\noccasion to ever ask it again, for I tell him very frankly that I am not\r\nin favor of negro citizenship. This furnishes me an occasion for saying a\r\nfew words upon the subject. I mentioned in a certain speech of mine, which\r\nhas been printed, that the Supreme Court had decided that a negro could\r\nnot possibly be made a citizen; and without saying what was my ground of\r\ncomplaint in regard to that, or whether I had any ground of complaint,\r\nJudge Douglas has from that thing manufactured nearly everything that he\r\never says about my disposition to produce an equality between the negroes\r\nand the white people. If any one will read my speech, he will find I\r\nmentioned that as one of the points decided in the course of the Supreme\r\nCourt opinions, but I did not state what objection I had to it. But Judge\r\nDouglas tells the people what my objection was when I did not tell them\r\nmyself. Now, my opinion is that the different States have the power to\r\nmake a negro a citizen under the Constitution of the United States if they\r\nchoose. The Dred Scott decision decides that they have not that power. If\r\nthe State of Illinois had that power, I should be opposed to the exercise\r\nof it. That is all I have to say about it.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas has told me that he heard my speeches north and my speeches\r\nsouth; that he had heard me at Ottawa and at Freeport in the north and\r\nrecently at Jonesboro in the south, and there was a very different cast of\r\nsentiment in the speeches made at the different points. I will not charge\r\nupon Judge Douglas that he wilfully misrepresents me, but I call upon\r\nevery fair-minded man to take these speeches and read them, and I dare him\r\nto point out any difference between my speeches north and south. While I\r\nam here perhaps I ought to say a word, if I have the time, in regard to\r\nthe latter portion of the Judge's speech, which was a sort of declamation\r\nin reference to my having said I entertained the belief that this\r\ngovernment would not endure half slave and half free. I have said so, and\r\nI did not say it without what seemed to me to be good reasons. It perhaps\r\nwould require more time than I have now to set forth these reasons in\r\ndetail; but let me ask you a few questions. Have we ever had any peace on\r\nthis slavery question? When are we to have peace upon it, if it is kept in\r\nthe position it now occupies? How are we ever to have peace upon it? That\r\nis an important question. To be sure, if we will all stop, and allow Judge\r\nDouglas and his friends to march on in their present career until they\r\nplant the institution all over the nation, here and wherever else our flag\r\nwaves, and we acquiesce in it, there will be peace. But let me ask Judge\r\nDouglas how he is going to get the people to do that? They have been\r\nwrangling over this question for at least forty years. This was the cause\r\nof the agitation resulting in the Missouri Compromise; this produced the\r\ntroubles at the annexation of Texas, in the acquisition of the territory\r\nacquired in the Mexican War. Again, this was the trouble which was quieted\r\nby the Compromise of 1850, when it was settled \"forever\" as both the great\r\npolitical parties declared in their National Conventions. That \"forever\"\r\nturned out to be just four years, when Judge Douglas himself reopened it.\r\nWhen is it likely to come to an end? He introduced the Nebraska Bill in\r\n1854 to put another end to the slavery agitation. He promised that it\r\nwould finish it all up immediately, and he has never made a speech\r\nsince, until he got into a quarrel with the President about the Lecompton\r\nConstitution, in which he has not declared that we are just at the end of\r\nthe slavery agitation. But in one speech, I think last winter, he did\r\nsay that he did n't quite see when the end of the slavery agitation would\r\ncome. Now he tells us again that it is all over and the people of Kansas\r\nhave voted down the Lecompton Constitution. How is it over? That was only\r\none of the attempts at putting an end to the slavery agitation--one\r\nof these \"final settlements.\" Is Kansas in the Union? Has she formed\r\na constitution that she is likely to come in under? Is not the slavery\r\nagitation still an open question in that Territory? Has the voting down\r\nof that constitution put an end to all the trouble? Is that more likely to\r\nsettle it than every one of these previous attempts to settle the slavery\r\nagitation? Now, at this day in the history of the world we can no more\r\nforetell where the end of this slavery agitation will be than we can see\r\nthe end of the world itself. The Nebraska-Kansas Bill was introduced four\r\nyears and a half ago, and if the agitation is ever to come to an end we\r\nmay say we are four years and a half nearer the end. So, too, we can say\r\nwe are four years and a half nearer the end of the world, and we can\r\njust as clearly see the end of the world as we can see the end of this\r\nagitation. The Kansas settlement did not conclude it. If Kansas should\r\nsink to-day, and leave a great vacant space in the earth's surface, this\r\nvexed question would still be among us. I say, then, there is no way of\r\nputting an end to the slavery agitation amongst us but to put it back upon\r\nthe basis where our fathers placed it; no way but to keep it out of our\r\nnew Territories,--to restrict it forever to the old States where it now\r\nexists. Then the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the\r\ncourse of ultimate extinction. That is one way of putting an end to the\r\nslavery agitation.\r\n\r\nThe other way is for us to surrender and let Judge Douglas and his friends\r\nhave their way and plant slavery over all the States; cease speaking of\r\nit as in any way a wrong; regard slavery as one of the common matters\r\nof property, and speak of negroes as we do of our horses and cattle. But\r\nwhile it drives on in its state of progress as it is now driving, and as\r\nit has driven for the last five years, I have ventured the opinion, and\r\nI say to-day, that we will have no end to the slavery agitation until\r\nit takes one turn or the other. I do not mean that when it takes a turn\r\ntoward ultimate extinction it will be in a day, nor in a year, nor in two\r\nyears. I do not suppose that in the most peaceful way ultimate extinction\r\nwould occur in less than a hundred years at least; but that it will occur\r\nin the best way for both races, in God's own good time, I have no doubt.\r\nBut, my friends, I have used up more of my time than I intended on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nNow, in regard to this matter about Trumbull and myself having made a\r\nbargain to sell out the entire Whig and Democratic parties in 1854: Judge\r\nDouglas brings forward no evidence to sustain his charge, except\r\nthe speech Matheny is said to have made in 1856, in which he told a\r\ncock-and-bull story of that sort, upon the same moral principles that\r\nJudge Douglas tells it here to-day. This is the simple truth. I do not\r\ncare greatly for the story, but this is the truth of it: and I have twice\r\ntold Judge Douglas to his face that from beginning to end there is not one\r\nword of truth in it. I have called upon him for the proof, and he does\r\nnot at all meet me as Trumbull met him upon that of which we were just\r\ntalking, by producing the record. He did n't bring the record because\r\nthere was no record for him to bring. When he asks if I am ready to\r\nindorse Trumbull's veracity after he has broken a bargain with me, I reply\r\nthat if Trumbull had broken a bargain with me I would not be likely to\r\nindorse his veracity; but I am ready to indorse his veracity because\r\nneither in that thing, nor in any other, in all the years that I have\r\nknown Lyman Trumbull, have I known him to fail of his word or tell a\r\nfalsehood large or small. It is for that reason that I indorse Lyman\r\nTrumbull.\r\n\r\n[Mr. JAMES BROWN (Douglas postmaster): \"What does Ford's History say about\r\nhim?\"]\r\n\r\nSome gentleman asks me what Ford's History says about him. My own\r\nrecollection is that Ford speaks of Trumbull in very disrespectful terms\r\nin several portions of his book, and that he talks a great deal worse of\r\nJudge Douglas. I refer you, sir, to the History for examination.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas complains at considerable length about a disposition on the\r\npart of Trumbull and myself to attack him personally. I want to attend to\r\nthat suggestion a moment. I don't want to be unjustly accused of dealing\r\nilliberally or unfairly with an adversary, either in court or in a\r\npolitical canvass or anywhere else. I would despise myself if I supposed\r\nmyself ready to deal less liberally with an adversary than I was willing\r\nto be treated myself. Judge Douglas in a general way, without putting it\r\nin a direct shape, revives the old charge against me in reference to the\r\nMexican War. He does not take the responsibility of putting it in a very\r\ndefinite form, but makes a general reference to it. That charge is more\r\nthan ten years old. He complains of Trumbull and myself because he says\r\nwe bring charges against him one or two years old. He knows, too, that\r\nin regard to the Mexican War story the more respectable papers of his\r\nown party throughout the State have been compelled to take it back and\r\nacknowledge that it was a lie.\r\n\r\n[Here Mr. LINCOLN turned to the crowd on the platform, and, selecting HON.\r\nORLANDO B. FICKLIN, led him forward and said:]\r\n\r\nI do not mean to do anything with Mr. FICKLIN except to present his face\r\nand tell you that he personally knows it to be a lie! He was a member\r\nof Congress at the only time I was in Congress, and [FICKLIN] knows\r\nthat whenever there was an attempt to procure a vote of mine which\r\nwould indorse the origin and justice of the war, I refused to give such\r\nindorsement and voted against it; but I never voted against the supplies\r\nfor the army, and he knows, as well as Judge Douglas, that whenever a\r\ndollar was asked by way of compensation or otherwise for the benefit of\r\nthe soldiers I gave all the votes that FICKLIN or Douglas did, and perhaps\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n[Mr. FICKLIN: My friends, I wish to say this in reference to the matter:\r\nMr. Lincoln and myself are just as good personal friends as Judge Douglas\r\nand myself. In reference to this Mexican War, my recollection is that\r\nwhen Ashmun's resolution [amendment] was offered by Mr. Ashmun of\r\nMassachusetts, in which he declared that the Mexican War was unnecessary\r\nand unconstitutionally commenced by the President-my recollection is that\r\nMr. Lincoln voted for that resolution.]\r\n\r\nThat is the truth. Now, you all remember that was a resolution censuring\r\nthe President for the manner in which the war was begun. You know they\r\nhave charged that I voted against the supplies, by which I starved the\r\nsoldiers who were out fighting the battles of their country. I say that\r\nFICKLIN knows it is false. When that charge was brought forward by the\r\nChicago Times, the Springfield Register [Douglas's organ] reminded the\r\nTimes that the charge really applied to John Henry; and I do know that\r\nJohn Henry is now making speeches and fiercely battling for Judge Douglas.\r\nIf the Judge now says that he offers this as a sort of setoff to what I\r\nsaid to-day in reference to Trumbull's charge, then I remind him that he\r\nmade this charge before I said a word about Trumbull's. He brought this\r\nforward at Ottawa, the first time we met face to face; and in the opening\r\nspeech that Judge Douglas made he attacked me in regard to a matter\r\nten years old. Is n't he a pretty man to be whining about people making\r\ncharges against him only two years old!\r\n\r\nThe Judge thinks it is altogether wrong that I should have dwelt upon this\r\ncharge of Trumbull's at all. I gave the apology for doing so in my opening\r\nspeech. Perhaps it did n't fix your attention. I said that when Judge\r\nDouglas was speaking at place--where I spoke on the succeeding day he used\r\nvery harsh language about this charge. Two or three times afterward I said\r\nI had confidence in Judge Trumbull's veracity and intelligence; and my own\r\nopinion was, from what I knew of the character of Judge Trumbull, that he\r\nwould vindicate his position and prove whatever he had stated to be true.\r\nThis I repeated two or three times; and then I dropped it, without saying\r\nanything more on the subject for weeks--perhaps a month. I passed it by\r\nwithout noticing it at all till I found, at Jacksonville, Judge Douglas\r\nin the plenitude of his power is not willing to answer Trumbull and let\r\nme alone, but he comes out there and uses this language: \"He should not\r\nhereafter occupy his time in refuting such charges made by Trumbull but\r\nthat, Lincoln having indorsed the character of Trumbull for veracity, he\r\nshould hold him [Lincoln] responsible for the slanders.\" What was Lincoln\r\nto do? Did he not do right, when he had the fit opportunity of meeting\r\nJudge Douglas here, to tell him he was ready for the responsibility? I\r\nask a candid audience whether in doing thus Judge Douglas was not the\r\nassailant rather than I? Here I meet him face to face, and say I am ready\r\nto take the responsibility, so far as it rests on me.\r\n\r\nHaving done so I ask the attention of this audience to the question\r\nwhether I have succeeded in sustaining the charge, and whether Judge\r\nDouglas has at all succeeded in rebutting it? You all heard me call upon\r\nhim to say which of these pieces of evidence was a forgery. Does he\r\nsay that what I present here as a copy of the original Toombs bill is a\r\nforgery? Does he say that what I present as a copy of the bill reported by\r\nhimself is a forgery, or what is presented as a transcript from the Globe\r\nof the quotations from Bigler's speech is a forgery? Does he say the\r\nquotations from his own speech are forgeries? Does he say this transcript\r\nfrom Trumbull's speech is a forgery?\r\n\r\n[\"He didn't deny one of them.\"]\r\n\r\nI would then like to know how it comes about that when each piece of a\r\nstory is true the whole story turns out false. I take it these people have\r\nsome sense; they see plainly that Judge Douglas is playing cuttle-fish,\r\na small species of fish that has no mode of defending itself when pursued\r\nexcept by throwing out a black fluid, which makes the water so dark the\r\nenemy cannot see it, and thus it escapes. Ain't the Judge playing the\r\ncuttle-fish?\r\n\r\nNow, I would ask very special attention to the consideration of Judge\r\nDouglas's speech at Jacksonville; and when you shall read his speech\r\nof to-day, I ask you to watch closely and see which of these pieces of\r\ntestimony, every one of which he says is a forgery, he has shown to\r\nbe such. Not one of them has he shown to be a forgery. Then I ask the\r\noriginal question, if each of the pieces of testimony is true, how is it\r\npossible that the whole is a falsehood?\r\n\r\nIn regard to Trumbull's charge that he [Douglas] inserted a provision into\r\nthe bill to prevent the constitution being submitted to the people, what\r\nwas his answer? He comes here and reads from the Congressional Globe to\r\nshow that on his motion that provision was struck out of the bill. Why,\r\nTrumbull has not said it was not stricken out, but Trumbull says\r\nhe [Douglas] put it in; and it is no answer to the charge to say he\r\nafterwards took it out. Both are perhaps true. It was in regard to that\r\nthing precisely that I told him he had dropped the cub. Trumbull shows you\r\nthat by his introducing the bill it was his cub. It is no answer to that\r\nassertion to call Trumbull a liar merely because he did not specially say\r\nthat Douglas struck it out. Suppose that were the case, does it answer\r\nTrumbull? I assert that you [pointing to an individual] are here to-day,\r\nand you undertake to prove me a liar by showing that you were in Mattoon\r\nyesterday. I say that you took your hat off your head, and you prove me\r\na liar by putting it on your head. That is the whole force of Douglas's\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to come back to my original question. Trumbull says that Judge\r\nDouglas had a bill with a provision in it for submitting a constitution\r\nto be made to a vote of the people of Kansas. Does Judge Douglas deny that\r\nfact? Does he deny that the provision which Trumbull reads was put in that\r\nbill? Then Trumbull says he struck it out. Does he dare to deny that? He\r\ndoes not, and I have the right to repeat the question,--Why Judge Douglas\r\ntook it out? Bigler has said there was a combination of certain senators,\r\namong whom he did not include Judge Douglas, by which it was agreed that\r\nthe Kansas Bill should have a clause in it not to have the constitution\r\nformed under it submitted to a vote of the people. He did not say that\r\nDouglas was among them, but we prove by another source that about the same\r\ntime Douglas comes into the Senate with that provision stricken out of the\r\nbill. Although Bigler cannot say they were all working in concert, yet\r\nit looks very much as if the thing was agreed upon and done with a mutual\r\nunderstanding after the conference; and while we do not know that it was\r\nabsolutely so, yet it looks so probable that we have a right to call upon\r\nthe man who knows the true reason why it was done to tell what the true\r\nreason was. When he will not tell what the true reason was, he stands in\r\nthe attitude of an accused thief who has stolen goods in his possession,\r\nand when called to account refuses to tell where he got them. Not only is\r\nthis the evidence, but when he comes in with the bill having the provision\r\nstricken out, he tells us in a speech, not then but since, that these\r\nalterations and modifications in the bill had been made by HIM, in\r\nconsultation with Toombs, the originator of the bill. He tells us the\r\nsame to-day. He says there were certain modifications made in the bill in\r\ncommittee that he did not vote for. I ask you to remember, while certain\r\namendments were made which he disapproved of, but which a majority of the\r\ncommittee voted in, he has himself told us that in this particular the\r\nalterations and modifications were made by him, upon consultation with\r\nToombs. We have his own word that these alterations were made by him, and\r\nnot by the committee. Now, I ask, what is the reason Judge Douglas is so\r\nchary about coming to the exact question? What is the reason he will not\r\ntell you anything about How it was made, BY WHOM it was made, or that he\r\nremembers it being made at all? Why does he stand playing upon the meaning\r\nof words and quibbling around the edges of the evidence? If he can explain\r\nall this, but leaves it unexplained, I have the right to infer that Judge\r\nDouglas understood it was the purpose of his party, in engineering that\r\nbill through, to make a constitution, and have Kansas come into the Union\r\nwith that constitution, without its being submitted to a vote of the\r\npeople. If he will explain his action on this question, by giving a\r\nbetter reason for the facts that happened than he has done, it will be\r\nsatisfactory. But until he does that--until he gives a better or more\r\nplausible reason than he has offered against the evidence in the case--I\r\nsuggest to him it will not avail him at all that he swells himself up,\r\ntakes on dignity, and calls people liars. Why, sir, there is not a word in\r\nTrumbull's speech that depends on Trumbull's veracity at all. He has only\r\narrayed the evidence and told you what follows as a matter of reasoning.\r\nThere is not a statement in the whole speech that depends on Trumbull's\r\nword. If you have ever studied geometry, you remember that by a course of\r\nreasoning Euclid proves that all the angles in a triangle are equal to\r\ntwo right angles. Euclid has shown you how to work it out. Now, if you\r\nundertake to disprove that proposition, and to show that it is erroneous,\r\nwould you prove it to be false by calling Euclid a liar? They tell me that\r\nmy time is out, and therefore I close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH JOINT DEBATE, AT GALESBURGH, OCTOBER 7, 1858\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN'S REPLY.\r\n\r\nMY FELLOW-CITIZENS: A very large portion of the speech which Judge Douglas\r\nhas addressed to you has previously been delivered and put in print. I\r\ndo not mean that for a hit upon the Judge at all.---If I had not been\r\ninterrupted, I was going to say that such an answer as I was able to make\r\nto a very large portion of it had already been more than once made and\r\npublished. There has been an opportunity afforded to the public to see\r\nour respective views upon the topics discussed in a large portion of the\r\nspeech which he has just delivered. I make these remarks for the purpose\r\nof excusing myself for not passing over the entire ground that the Judge\r\nhas traversed. I however desire to take up some of the points that he\r\nhas attended to, and ask your attention to them, and I shall follow him\r\nbackwards upon some notes which I have taken, reversing the order, by\r\nbeginning where he concluded.\r\n\r\nThe Judge has alluded to the Declaration of Independence, and insisted\r\nthat negroes are not included in that Declaration; and that it is a\r\nslander upon the framers of that instrument to suppose that negroes\r\nwere meant therein; and he asks you: Is it possible to believe that Mr.\r\nJefferson, who penned the immortal paper, could have supposed himself\r\napplying the language of that instrument to the negro race, and yet held\r\na portion of that race in slavery? Would he not at once have freed them?\r\nI only have to remark upon this part of the Judge's speech (and that, too,\r\nvery briefly, for I shall not detain myself, or you, upon that point for\r\nany great length of time), that I believe the entire records of the world,\r\nfrom the date of the Declaration of Independence up to within three years\r\nago, may be searched in vain for one single affirmation, from one single\r\nman, that the negro was not included in the Declaration of Independence;\r\nI think I may defy Judge Douglas to show that he ever said so, that\r\nWashington ever said so, that any President ever said so, that any member\r\nof Congress ever said so, or that any living man upon the whole earth ever\r\nsaid so, until the necessities of the present policy of the Democratic\r\nparty, in regard to slavery, had to invent that affirmation. And I will\r\nremind Judge Douglas and this audience that while Mr. Jefferson was the\r\nowner of slaves, as undoubtedly he was, in speaking upon this very subject\r\nhe used the strong language that \"he trembled for his country when he\r\nremembered that God was just\"; and I will offer the highest premium in\r\nmy power to Judge Douglas if he will show that he, in all his life, ever\r\nuttered a sentiment at all akin to that of Jefferson.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to which I will ask your attention is the Judge's comments\r\nupon the fact, as he assumes it to be, that we cannot call our public\r\nmeetings as Republican meetings; and he instances Tazewell County as one\r\nof the places where the friends of Lincoln have called a public meeting\r\nand have not dared to name it a Republican meeting. He instances Monroe\r\nCounty as another, where Judge Trumbull and Jehu Baker addressed the\r\npersons whom the Judge assumes to be the friends of Lincoln calling them\r\nthe \"Free Democracy.\" I have the honor to inform Judge Douglas that he\r\nspoke in that very county of Tazewell last Saturday, and I was there on\r\nTuesday last; and when he spoke there, he spoke under a call not venturing\r\nto use the word \"Democrat.\" [Turning to Judge Douglas.] what think you of\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nSo, again, there is another thing to which I would ask the Judge's\r\nattention upon this subject. In the contest of 1856 his party delighted\r\nto call themselves together as the \"National Democracy\"; but now, if\r\nthere should be a notice put up anywhere for a meeting of the \"National\r\nDemocracy,\" Judge Douglas and his friends would not come. They would not\r\nsuppose themselves invited. They would understand that it was a call for\r\nthose hateful postmasters whom he talks about.\r\n\r\nNow a few words in regard to these extracts from speeches of mine which\r\nJudge Douglas has read to you, and which he supposes are in very great\r\ncontrast to each other. Those speeches have been before the public for a\r\nconsiderable time, and if they have any inconsistency in them, if there\r\nis any conflict in them, the public have been able to detect it. When the\r\nJudge says, in speaking on this subject, that I make speeches of one sort\r\nfor the people of the northern end of the State, and of a different sort\r\nfor the southern people, he assumes that I do not understand that my\r\nspeeches will be put in print and read north and south. I knew all the\r\nwhile that the speech that I made at Chicago, and the one I made at\r\nJonesboro and the one at Charleston, would all be put in print, and all\r\nthe reading and intelligent men in the community would see them and know\r\nall about my opinions. And I have not supposed, and do not now suppose,\r\nthat there is any conflict whatever between them. But the Judge will have\r\nit that if we do not confess that there is a sort of inequality between\r\nthe white and black races which justifies us in making them slaves, we\r\nmust then insist that there is a degree of equality that requires us to\r\nmake them our wives. Now, I have all the while taken a broad distinction\r\nin regard to that matter; and that is all there is in these different\r\nspeeches which he arrays here; and the entire reading of either of the\r\nspeeches will show that that distinction was made. Perhaps by taking two\r\nparts of the same speech he could have got up as much of a conflict as\r\nthe one he has found. I have all the while maintained that in so far as it\r\nshould be insisted that there was an equality between the white and black\r\nraces that should produce a perfect social and political equality, it was\r\nan impossibility. This you have seen in my printed speeches, and with it\r\nI have said that in their right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness,\" as proclaimed in that old Declaration, the inferior races are\r\nour equals. And these declarations I have constantly made in reference\r\nto the abstract moral question, to contemplate and consider when we are\r\nlegislating about any new country which is not already cursed with\r\nthe actual presence of the evil,--slavery. I have never manifested any\r\nimpatience with the necessities that spring from the actual presence of\r\nblack people amongst us, and the actual existence of slavery amongst us\r\nwhere it does already exist; but I have insisted that, in legislating for\r\nnew countries where it does not exist there is no just rule other than\r\nthat of moral and abstract right! With reference to those new countries,\r\nthose maxims as to the right of a people to \"life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness\" were the just rules to be constantly referred\r\nto. There is no misunderstanding this, except by men interested to\r\nmisunderstand it. I take it that I have to address an intelligent and\r\nreading community, who will peruse what I say, weigh it, and then judge\r\nwhether I advanced improper or unsound views, or whether I advanced\r\nhypocritical, and deceptive, and contrary views in different portions of\r\nthe country. I believe myself to be guilty of no such thing as the latter,\r\nthough, of course, I cannot claim that I am entirely free from all error\r\nin the opinions I advance.\r\n\r\nThe Judge has also detained us awhile in regard to the distinction between\r\nhis party and our party. His he assumes to be a national party, ours a\r\nsectional one. He does this in asking the question whether this country\r\nhas any interest in the maintenance of the Republican party. He assumes\r\nthat our party is altogether sectional, that the party to which he\r\nadheres is national; and the argument is, that no party can be a rightful\r\nparty--and be based upon rightful principles--unless it can announce its\r\nprinciples everywhere. I presume that Judge Douglas could not go into\r\nRussia and announce the doctrine of our national Democracy; he could not\r\ndenounce the doctrine of kings and emperors and monarchies in Russia; and\r\nit may be true of this country that in some places we may not be able to\r\nproclaim a doctrine as clearly true as the truth of democracy, because\r\nthere is a section so directly opposed to it that they will not tolerate\r\nus in doing so. Is it the true test of the soundness of a doctrine that in\r\nsome places people won't let you proclaim it? Is that the way to test the\r\ntruth of any doctrine? Why, I understood that at one time the people of\r\nChicago would not let Judge Douglas preach a certain favorite doctrine of\r\nhis. I commend to his consideration the question whether he takes that as\r\na test of the unsoundness of what he wanted to preach.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing to which I wish to ask attention for a little while\r\non this occasion. What has always been the evidence brought forward to\r\nprove that the Republican party is a sectional party? The main one was\r\nthat in the Southern portion of the Union the people did not let the\r\nRepublicans proclaim their doctrines amongst them. That has been the main\r\nevidence brought forward,--that they had no supporters, or substantially\r\nnone, in the Slave States. The South have not taken hold of our principles\r\nas we announce them; nor does Judge Douglas now grapple with those\r\nprinciples. We have a Republican State Platform, laid down in Springfield\r\nin June last stating our position all the way through the questions before\r\nthe country. We are now far advanced in this canvass. Judge Douglas and\r\nI have made perhaps forty speeches apiece, and we have now for the fifth\r\ntime met face to face in debate, and up to this day I have not found\r\neither Judge Douglas or any friend of his taking hold of the Republican\r\nplatform, or laying his finger upon anything in it that is wrong. I ask\r\nyou all to recollect that. Judge Douglas turns away from the platform\r\nof principles to the fact that he can find people somewhere who will not\r\nallow us to announce those principles. If he had great confidence that our\r\nprinciples were wrong, he would take hold of them and demonstrate them to\r\nbe wrong. But he does not do so. The only evidence he has of their being\r\nwrong is in the fact that there are people who won't allow us to preach\r\nthem. I ask again, is that the way to test the soundness of a doctrine?\r\n\r\nI ask his attention also to the fact that by the rule of nationality he is\r\nhimself fast becoming sectional. I ask his attention to the fact that his\r\nspeeches would not go as current now south of the Ohio River as they have\r\nformerly gone there I ask his attention to the fact that he felicitates\r\nhimself to-day that all the Democrats of the free States are agreeing with\r\nhim, while he omits to tell us that the Democrats of any slave State agree\r\nwith him. If he has not thought of this, I commend to his consideration\r\nthe evidence in his own declaration, on this day, of his becoming\r\nsectional too. I see it rapidly approaching. Whatever may be the result\r\nof this ephemeral contest between Judge Douglas and myself, I see the\r\nday rapidly approaching when his pill of sectionalism, which he has been\r\nthrusting down the throats of Republicans for years past, will be crowded\r\ndown his own throat.\r\n\r\nNow, in regard to what Judge Douglas said (in the beginning of his speech)\r\nabout the Compromise of 1850 containing the principles of the Nebraska\r\nBill, although I have often presented my views upon that subject, yet as\r\nI have not done so in this canvass, I will, if you please, detain you a\r\nlittle with them. I have always maintained, so far as I was able, that\r\nthere was nothing of the principle of the Nebraska Bill in the Compromise\r\nof 1850 at all,--nothing whatever. Where can you find the principle of the\r\nNebraska Bill in that Compromise? If anywhere, in the two pieces of the\r\nCompromise organizing the Territories of New Mexico and Utah. It was\r\nexpressly provided in these two acts that when they came to be admitted\r\ninto the Union they should be admitted with or without slavery, as they\r\nshould choose, by their own constitutions. Nothing was said in either of\r\nthose acts as to what was to be done in relation to slavery during the\r\nTerritorial existence of those Territories, while Henry Clay constantly\r\nmade the declaration (Judge Douglas recognizing him as a leader) that, in\r\nhis opinion, the old Mexican laws would control that question during the\r\nTerritorial existence, and that these old Mexican laws excluded slavery.\r\nHow can that be used as a principle for declaring that during the\r\nTerritorial existence as well as at the time of framing the constitution\r\nthe people, if you please, might have slaves if they wanted them? I am not\r\ndiscussing the question whether it is right or wrong; but how are the New\r\nMexican and Utah laws patterns for the Nebraska Bill? I maintain that the\r\norganization of Utah and New Mexico did not establish a general principle\r\nat all. It had no feature of establishing a general principle. The acts to\r\nwhich I have referred were a part of a general system of Compromises.\r\nThey did not lay down what was proposed as a regular policy for the\r\nTerritories, only an agreement in this particular case to do in that way,\r\nbecause other things were done that were to be a compensation for it. They\r\nwere allowed to come in in that shape, because in another way it was paid\r\nfor, considering that as a part of that system of measures called the\r\nCompromise of 1850, which finally included half-a-dozen acts. It included\r\nthe admission of California as a free State, which was kept out of the\r\nUnion for half a year because it had formed a free constitution. It\r\nincluded the settlement of the boundary of Texas, which had been undefined\r\nbefore, which was in itself a slavery question; for if you pushed the line\r\nfarther west, you made Texas larger, and made more slave territory;\r\nwhile, if you drew the line toward the east, you narrowed the boundary and\r\ndiminished the domain of slavery, and by so much increased free territory.\r\nIt included the abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia.\r\nIt included the passage of a new Fugitive Slave law. All these things were\r\nput together, and, though passed in separate acts, were nevertheless, in\r\nlegislation (as the speeches at the time will show), made to depend upon\r\neach other. Each got votes with the understanding that the other measures\r\nwere to pass, and by this system of compromise, in that series of\r\nmeasures, those two bills--the New Mexico and Utah bills--were passed: and\r\nI say for that reason they could not be taken as models, framed upon\r\ntheir own intrinsic principle, for all future Territories. And I have the\r\nevidence of this in the fact that Judge Douglas, a year afterward, or more\r\nthan a year afterward, perhaps, when he first introduced bills for the\r\npurpose of framing new Territories, did not attempt to follow these bills\r\nof New Mexico and Utah; and even when he introduced this Nebraska Bill, I\r\nthink you will discover that he did not exactly follow them. But I do not\r\nwish to dwell at great length upon this branch of the discussion. My own\r\nopinion is, that a thorough investigation will show most plainly that the\r\nNew Mexico and Utah bills were part of a system of compromise, and not\r\ndesigned as patterns for future Territorial legislation; and that this\r\nNebraska Bill did not follow them as a pattern at all.\r\n\r\nThe Judge tells, in proceeding, that he is opposed to making any odious\r\ndistinctions between free and slave States. I am altogether unaware that\r\nthe Republicans are in favor of making any odious distinctions between the\r\nfree and slave States. But there is still a difference, I think, between\r\nJudge Douglas and the Republicans in this. I suppose that the real\r\ndifference between Judge Douglas and his friends, and the Republicans on\r\nthe contrary, is, that the Judge is not in favor of making any difference\r\nbetween slavery and liberty; that he is in favor of eradicating, of\r\npressing out of view, the questions of preference in this country for free\r\nor slave institutions; and consequently every sentiment he utters discards\r\nthe idea that there is any wrong in slavery. Everything that emanates from\r\nhim or his coadjutors in their course of policy carefully excludes the\r\nthought that there is anything wrong in slavery. All their arguments, if\r\nyou will consider them, will be seen to exclude the thought that there is\r\nanything whatever wrong in slavery. If you will take the Judge's speeches,\r\nand select the short and pointed sentences expressed by him,--as his\r\ndeclaration that he \"don't care whether slavery is voted up or down,\"--you\r\nwill see at once that this is perfectly logical, if you do not admit that\r\nslavery is wrong. If you do admit that it is wrong, Judge Douglas cannot\r\nlogically say he don't care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down.\r\nJudge Douglas declares that if any community wants slavery they have a\r\nright to have it. He can say that logically, if he says that there is no\r\nwrong in slavery; but if you admit that there is a wrong in it, he cannot\r\nlogically say that anybody has a right to do wrong. He insists that upon\r\nthe score of equality the owners of slaves and owners of property--of\r\nhorses and every other sort of property--should be alike, and hold them\r\nalike in a new Territory. That is perfectly logical if the two species of\r\nproperty are alike and are equally founded in right. But if you admit that\r\none of them is wrong, you cannot institute any equality between right and\r\nwrong. And from this difference of sentiment,--the belief on the part of\r\none that the institution is wrong, and a policy springing from that belief\r\nwhich looks to the arrest of the enlargement of that wrong, and this other\r\nsentiment, that it is no wrong, and a policy sprung from that sentiment,\r\nwhich will tolerate no idea of preventing the wrong from growing larger,\r\nand looks to there never being an end to it through all the existence of\r\nthings,--arises the real difference between Judge Douglas and his friends\r\non the one hand and the Republicans on the other. Now, I confess myself as\r\nbelonging to that class in the country who contemplate slavery as a moral,\r\nsocial, and political evil, having due regard for its actual existence\r\namongst us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory\r\nway, and to all the constitutional obligations which have been thrown\r\nabout it; but, nevertheless, desire a policy that looks to the prevention\r\nof it as a wrong, and looks hopefully to the time when as a wrong it may\r\ncome to an end.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas has again, for, I believe, the fifth time, if not the\r\nseventh, in my presence, reiterated his charge of a conspiracy or\r\ncombination between the National Democrats and Republicans. What evidence\r\nJudge Douglas has upon this subject I know not, inasmuch as he never\r\nfavors us with any. I have said upon a former occasion, and I do not\r\nchoose to suppress it now, that I have no objection to the division in\r\nthe Judge's party. He got it up himself. It was all his and their work.\r\nHe had, I think, a great deal more to do with the steps that led to the\r\nLecompton Constitution than Mr. Buchanan had; though at last, when they\r\nreached it, they quarreled over it, and their friends divided upon it. I\r\nam very free to confess to Judge Douglas that I have no objection to the\r\ndivision; but I defy the Judge to show any evidence that I have in any way\r\npromoted that division, unless he insists on being a witness himself in\r\nmerely saying so. I can give all fair friends of Judge Douglas here\r\nto understand exactly the view that Republicans take in regard to that\r\ndivision. Don't you remember how two years ago the opponents of the\r\nDemocratic party were divided between Fremont and Fillmore? I guess you\r\ndo. Any Democrat who remembers that division will remember also that he\r\nwas at the time very glad of it, and then he will be able to see all there\r\nis between the National Democrats and the Republicans. What we now think\r\nof the two divisions of Democrats, you then thought of the Fremont and\r\nFillmore divisions. That is all there is of it.\r\n\r\nBut if the Judge continues to put forward the declaration that there is\r\nan unholy and unnatural alliance between the Republicans and the National\r\nDemocrats, I now want to enter my protest against receiving him as an\r\nentirely competent witness upon that subject. I want to call to the\r\nJudge's attention an attack he made upon me in the first one of these\r\ndebates, at Ottawa, on the 21st of August. In order to fix extreme\r\nAbolitionism upon me, Judge Douglas read a set of resolutions which he\r\ndeclared had been passed by a Republican State Convention, in October,\r\n1854, at Springfield, Illinois, and he declared I had taken part in that\r\nConvention. It turned out that although a few men calling themselves an\r\nanti-Nebraska State Convention had sat at Springfield about that time, yet\r\nneither did I take any part in it, nor did it pass the resolutions or any\r\nsuch resolutions as Judge Douglas read. So apparent had it become that the\r\nresolutions which he read had not been passed at Springfield at all,\r\nnor by a State Convention in which I had taken part, that seven days\r\nafterward, at Freeport, Judge Douglas declared that he had been misled by\r\nCharles H. Lanphier, editor of the State Register, and Thomas L. Harris,\r\nmember of Congress in that district, and he promised in that speech that\r\nwhen he went to Springfield he would investigate the matter. Since\r\nthen Judge Douglas has been to Springfield, and I presume has made the\r\ninvestigation; but a month has passed since he has been there, and, so\r\nfar as I know, he has made no report of the result of his investigation.\r\nI have waited as I think sufficient time for the report of that\r\ninvestigation, and I have some curiosity to see and hear it. A fraud, an\r\nabsolute forgery was committed, and the perpetration of it was traced to\r\nthe three,--Lanphier, Harris, and Douglas. Whether it can be narrowed in\r\nany way so as to exonerate any one of them, is what Judge Douglas's report\r\nwould probably show.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the set of resolutions read by Judge Douglas were\r\npublished in the Illinois State Register on the 16th of October, 1854, as\r\nbeing the resolutions of an anti-Nebraska Convention which had sat in\r\nthat same month of October, at Springfield. But it is also true that the\r\npublication in the Register was a forgery then, and the question is still\r\nbehind, which of the three, if not all of them, committed that forgery.\r\nThe idea that it was done by mistake is absurd. The article in the\r\nIllinois State Register contains part of the real proceedings of that\r\nSpringfield Convention, showing that the writer of the article had\r\nthe real proceedings before him, and purposely threw out the genuine\r\nresolutions passed by the Convention and fraudulently substituted the\r\nothers. Lanphier then, as now, was the editor of the Register, so that\r\nthere seems to be but little room for his escape. But then it is to\r\nbe borne in mind that Lanphier had less interest in the object of that\r\nforgery than either of the other two. The main object of that forgery at\r\nthat time was to beat Yates and elect Harris to Congress, and that object\r\nwas known to be exceedingly dear to Judge Douglas at that time. Harris and\r\nDouglas were both in Springfield when the Convention was in session,\r\nand although they both left before the fraud appeared in the Register,\r\nsubsequent events show that they have both had their eyes fixed upon that\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nThe fraud having been apparently successful upon the occasion, both Harris\r\nand Douglas have more than once since then been attempting to put it to\r\nnew uses. As the fisherman's wife, whose drowned husband was brought home\r\nwith his body full of eels, said when she was asked what was to be done\r\nwith him, \"Take the eels out and set him again,\" so Harris and Douglas\r\nhave shown a disposition to take the eels out of that stale fraud by which\r\nthey gained Harris's election, and set the fraud again more than once. On\r\nthe 9th of July, 1856, Douglas attempted a repetition of it upon Trumbull\r\non the floor of the Senate of the United States, as will appear from the\r\nappendix of the Congressional Globe of that date.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August, Harris attempted it again upon Norton in the House\r\nof Representatives, as will appear by the same documents,--the appendix\r\nto the Congressional Globe of that date. On the 21st of August last, all\r\nthree--Lanphier, Douglas, and Harris--reattempted it upon me at Ottawa.\r\nIt has been clung to and played out again and again as an exceedingly high\r\ntrump by this blessed trio. And now that it has been discovered publicly\r\nto be a fraud we find that Judge Douglas manifests no surprise at it at\r\nall. He makes no complaint of Lanphier, who must have known it to be a\r\nfraud from the beginning. He, Lanphier, and Harris are just as cozy now\r\nand just as active in the concoction of new schemes as they were before\r\nthe general discovery of this fraud. Now, all this is very natural if they\r\nare all alike guilty in that fraud, and it is very unnatural if any one\r\nof them is innocent. Lanphier perhaps insists that the rule of honor\r\namong thieves does not quite require him to take all upon himself,\r\nand consequently my friend Judge Douglas finds it difficult to make a\r\nsatisfactory report upon his investigation. But meanwhile the three are\r\nagreed that each is \"a most honorable man.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas requires an indorsement of his truth and honor by a\r\nre-election to the United States Senate, and he makes and reports against\r\nme and against Judge Trumbull, day after day, charges which we know to\r\nbe utterly untrue, without for a moment seeming to think that this one\r\nunexplained fraud, which he promised to investigate, will be the least\r\ndrawback to his claim to belief. Harris ditto. He asks a re-election to\r\nthe lower House of Congress without seeming to remember at all that he is\r\ninvolved in this dishonorable fraud! The Illinois State Register, edited\r\nby Lanphier, then, as now, the central organ of both Harris and Douglas,\r\ncontinues to din the public ear with this assertion, without seeming to\r\nsuspect that these assertions are at all lacking in title to belief.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the question still recurs upon us, How did that fraud\r\noriginally get into the State Register? Lanphier then, as now, was the\r\neditor of that paper. Lanphier knows. Lanphier cannot be ignorant of how\r\nand by whom it was originally concocted. Can he be induced to tell, or,\r\nif he has told, can Judge Douglas be induced to tell how it originally was\r\nconcocted? It may be true that Lanphier insists that the two men for whose\r\nbenefit it was originally devised shall at least bear their share of it!\r\nHow that is, I do not know, and while it remains unexplained I hope to be\r\npardoned if I insist that the mere fact of Judge Douglas making charges\r\nagainst Trumbull and myself is not quite sufficient evidence to establish\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nWhile we were at Freeport, in one of these joint discussions, I answered\r\ncertain interrogatories which Judge Douglas had propounded to me, and then\r\nin turn propounded some to him, which he in a sort of way answered. The\r\nthird one of these interrogatories I have with me, and wish now to make\r\nsome comments upon it. It was in these words: \"If the Supreme Court of\r\n States cannot exclude slavery from their limits, are you in favor of\r\nacquiescing in, adhering to, and following such decision as a rule of\r\npolitical action?\"\r\n\r\nTo this interrogatory Judge Douglas made no answer in any just sense of\r\nthe word. He contented himself with sneering at the thought that it was\r\npossible for the Supreme Court ever to make such a decision. He sneered at\r\nme for propounding the interrogatory. I had not propounded it without some\r\nreflection, and I wish now to address to this audience some remarks upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the second clause of the sixth article, I believe it is, of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, we find the following language:\r\n\r\n\"This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made\r\nin pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under\r\nthe authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land;\r\nand the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the\r\nConstitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThe essence of the Dred Scott case is compressed into the sentence which I\r\nwill now read:\r\n\r\n\"Now, as we have already said in an earlier part of this opinion, upon\r\na different point, the right of property in a slave is distinctly and\r\nexpressly affirmed in the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nI repeat it, \"The right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly\r\naffirmed in the Constitution\"! What is it to be \"affirmed\" in the\r\nConstitution? Made firm in the Constitution, so made that it cannot be\r\nseparated from the Constitution without breaking the Constitution; durable\r\nas the Constitution, and part of the Constitution. Now, remembering the\r\nprovision of the Constitution which I have read--affirming that that\r\ninstrument is the supreme law of the land; that the judges of every State\r\nshall be bound by it, any law or constitution of any State to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding; that the right of property in a slave is affirmed in\r\nthat Constitution, is made, formed into, and cannot be separated from\r\nit without breaking it; durable as the instrument; part of the\r\ninstrument;--what follows as a short and even syllogistic argument from\r\nit? I think it follows, and I submit to the consideration of men capable\r\nof arguing whether, as I state it, in syllogistic form, the argument has\r\nany fault in it:\r\n\r\nNothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can destroy a right\r\ndistinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nTherefore, nothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can destroy\r\nthe right of property in a slave.\r\n\r\nI believe that no fault can be pointed out in that argument; assuming the\r\ntruth of the premises, the conclusion, so far as I have capacity at all to\r\nunderstand it, follows inevitably. There is a fault in it as I think, but\r\nthe fault is not in the reasoning; but the falsehood in fact is a fault\r\nof the premises. I believe that the right of property in a slave is not\r\ndistinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, and Judge Douglas\r\nthinks it is. I believe that the Supreme Court and the advocates of that\r\ndecision may search in vain for the place in the Constitution where the\r\nright of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed I say,\r\ntherefore, that I think one of the premises is not true in fact. But it is\r\ntrue with Judge Douglas. It is true with the Supreme Court who pronounced\r\nit. They are estopped from denying it, and being estopped from denying it,\r\nthe conclusion follows that, the Constitution of the United States being\r\nthe supreme law, no constitution or law can interfere with it. It\r\nbeing affirmed in the decision that the right of property in a slave is\r\ndistinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, the conclusion\r\ninevitably follows that no State law or constitution can destroy that\r\nright. I then say to Judge Douglas and to all others that I think it will\r\ntake a better answer than a sneer to show that those who have said that\r\nthe right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in\r\nthe Constitution, are not prepared to show that no constitution or law\r\ncan destroy that right. I say I believe it will take a far better argument\r\nthan a mere sneer to show to the minds of intelligent men that whoever has\r\nso said is not prepared, whenever public sentiment is so far advanced as\r\nto justify it, to say the other. This is but an opinion, and the opinion\r\nof one very humble man; but it is my opinion that the Dred Scott decision,\r\nas it is, never would have been made in its present form if the party that\r\nmade it had not been sustained previously by the elections. My own opinion\r\nis, that the new Dred Scott decision, deciding against the right of the\r\npeople of the States to exclude slavery, will never be made if that party\r\nis not sustained by the elections. I believe, further, that it is just as\r\nsure to be made as to-morrow is to come, if that party shall be sustained.\r\nI have said, upon a former occasion, and I repeat it now, that the course\r\nof arguement that Judge Douglas makes use of upon this subject (I charge\r\nnot his motives in this), is preparing the public mind for that new Dred\r\nScott decision. I have asked him again to point out to me the reasons for\r\nhis first adherence to the Dred Scott decision as it is. I have turned his\r\nattention to the fact that General Jackson differed with him in regard\r\nto the political obligation of a Supreme Court decision. I have asked his\r\nattention to the fact that Jefferson differed with him in regard to the\r\npolitical obligation of a Supreme Court decision. Jefferson said that\r\n\"Judges are as honest as other men, and not more so.\" And he said,\r\nsubstantially, that whenever a free people should give up in absolute\r\nsubmission to any department of government, retaining for themselves no\r\nappeal from it, their liberties were gone. I have asked his attention\r\nto the fact that the Cincinnati platform, upon which he says he stands,\r\ndisregards a time-honored decision of the Supreme Court, in denying the\r\npower of Congress to establish a National Bank. I have asked his attention\r\nto the fact that he himself was one of the most active instruments at one\r\ntime in breaking down the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois because\r\nit had made a decision distasteful to him,--a struggle ending in the\r\nremarkable circumstance of his sitting down as one of the new Judges who\r\nwere to overslaugh that decision; getting his title of Judge in that very\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSo far in this controversy I can get no answer at all from Judge Douglas\r\nupon these subjects. Not one can I get from him, except that he swells\r\nhimself up and says, \"All of us who stand by the decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt are the friends of the Constitution; all you fellows that dare\r\nquestion it in any way are the enemies of the Constitution.\" Now, in this\r\nvery devoted adherence to this decision, in opposition to all the great\r\npolitical leaders whom he has recognized as leaders, in opposition to his\r\nformer self and history, there is something very marked. And the manner\r\nin which he adheres to it,--not as being right upon the merits, as\r\nhe conceives (because he did not discuss that at all), but as being\r\nabsolutely obligatory upon every one simply because of the source from\r\nwhence it comes, as that which no man can gainsay, whatever it may\r\nbe,--this is another marked feature of his adherence to that decision.\r\nIt marks it in this respect, that it commits him to the next decision,\r\nwhenever it comes, as being as obligatory as this one, since he does not\r\ninvestigate it, and won't inquire whether this opinion is right or wrong.\r\nSo he takes the next one without inquiring whether it is right or wrong.\r\nHe teaches men this doctrine, and in so doing prepares the public mind to\r\ntake the next decision when it comes, without any inquiry. In this I think\r\nI argue fairly (without questioning motives at all) that Judge Douglas\r\nis most ingeniously and powerfully preparing the public mind to take that\r\ndecision when it comes; and not only so, but he is doing it in various\r\nother ways. In these general maxims about liberty, in his assertions that\r\nhe \"don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down,\"; that \"whoever\r\nwants slavery has a right to have it\"; that \"upon principles of equality\r\nit should be allowed to go everywhere\"; that \"there is no inconsistency\r\nbetween free and slave institutions\"--in this he is also preparing\r\n(whether purposely or not) the way for making the institution of slavery\r\nnational! I repeat again, for I wish no misunderstanding, that I do not\r\ncharge that he means it so; but I call upon your minds to inquire, if you\r\nwere going to get the best instrument you could, and then set it to work\r\nin the most ingenious way, to prepare the public mind for this movement,\r\noperating in the free States, where there is now an abhorrence of the\r\ninstitution of slavery, could you find an instrument so capable of doing\r\nit as Judge Douglas, or one employed in so apt a way to do it?\r\n\r\nI have said once before, and I will repeat it now, that Mr. Clay, when he\r\nwas once answering an objection to the Colonization Society, that it had a\r\ntendency to the ultimate emancipation of the slaves, said that:\r\n\r\n\"Those who would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate\r\nemancipation must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of the\r\nColonization Society: they must go back to the era of our liberty and\r\nindependence, and muzzle the cannon that thunders its annual joyous\r\nreturn; they must blow out the moral lights around us; they must penetrate\r\nthe human soul, and eradicate the light of reason and the love of\r\nliberty!\"\r\n\r\nAnd I do think--I repeat, though I said it on a former occasion--that\r\nJudge Douglas and whoever, like him, teaches that the negro has no share,\r\nhumble though it may be, in the Declaration of Independence, is going back\r\nto the era of our liberty and independence, and, so far as in him lies,\r\nmuzzling the cannon that thunders its annual joyous return; that he is\r\nblowing out the moral lights around us, when he contends that whoever\r\nwants slaves has a right to hold them; that he is penetrating, so far as\r\nlies in his power, the human soul, and eradicating the light of reason and\r\nthe love of liberty, when he is in every possible way preparing the\r\npublic mind, by his vast influence, for making the institution of slavery\r\nperpetual and national.\r\n\r\nThere is, my friends, only one other point to which I will call your\r\nattention for the remaining time that I have left me, and perhaps I shall\r\nnot occupy the entire time that I have, as that one point may not take me\r\nclear through it.\r\n\r\nAmong the interrogatories that Judge Douglas propounded to me at Freeport,\r\nthere was one in about this language:\r\n\r\n\"Are you opposed to the acquisition of any further territory to the United\r\nStates, unless slavery shall first be prohibited therein?\"\r\n\r\nI answered, as I thought, in this way: that I am not generally opposed\r\nto the acquisition of additional territory, and that I would support a\r\nproposition for the acquisition of additional territory according as my\r\nsupporting it was or was not calculated to aggravate this slavery question\r\namongst us. I then proposed to Judge Douglas another interrogatory,\r\nwhich was correlative to that: \"Are you in favor of acquiring additional\r\nterritory, in disregard of how it may affect us upon the slavery\r\nquestion?\" Judge Douglas answered,--that is, in his own way he answered\r\nit. I believe that, although he took a good many words to answer it, it\r\nwas a little more fully answered than any other. The substance of his\r\nanswer was that this country would continue to expand; that it would\r\nneed additional territory; that it was as absurd to suppose that we could\r\ncontinue upon our present territory, enlarging in population as we are, as\r\nit would be to hoop a boy twelve years of age, and expect him to grow to\r\nman's size without bursting the hoops. I believe it was something\r\nlike that. Consequently, he was in favor of the acquisition of further\r\nterritory as fast as we might need it, in disregard of how it might affect\r\nthe slavery question. I do not say this as giving his exact language,\r\nbut he said so substantially; and he would leave the question of slavery,\r\nwhere the territory was acquired, to be settled by the people of the\r\nacquired territory. [\"That's the doctrine.\"] May be it is; let us consider\r\nthat for a while. This will probably, in the run of things, become one of\r\nthe concrete manifestations of this slavery question. If Judge Douglas's\r\npolicy upon this question succeeds, and gets fairly settled down, until\r\nall opposition is crushed out, the next thing will be a grab for the\r\nterritory of poor Mexico, an invasion of the rich lands of South America,\r\nthen the adjoining islands will follow, each one of which promises\r\nadditional slave-fields. And this question is to be left to the people of\r\nthose countries for settlement. When we get Mexico, I don't know whether\r\nthe Judge will be in favor of the Mexican people that we get with it\r\nsettling that question for themselves and all others; because we know the\r\nJudge has a great horror for mongrels, and I understand that the people of\r\nMexico are most decidedly a race of mongrels. I understand that there\r\nis not more than one person there out of eight who is pure white, and I\r\nsuppose from the Judge's previous declaration that when we get Mexico, or\r\nany considerable portion of it, that he will be in favor of these mongrels\r\nsettling the question, which would bring him somewhat into collision with\r\nhis horror of an inferior race.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered, though, that this power of acquiring additional\r\nterritory is a power confided to the President and the Senate of the\r\nUnited States. It is a power not under the control of the representatives\r\nof the people any further than they, the President and the Senate, can be\r\nconsidered the representatives of the people. Let me illustrate that by a\r\ncase we have in our history. When we acquired the territory from Mexico in\r\nthe Mexican War, the House of Representatives, composed of the immediate\r\nrepresentatives of the people, all the time insisted that the territory\r\nthus to be acquired should be brought in upon condition that slavery\r\nshould be forever prohibited therein, upon the terms and in the language\r\nthat slavery had been prohibited from coming into this country. That was\r\ninsisted upon constantly and never failed to call forth an assurance that\r\nany territory thus acquired should have that prohibition in it, so far as\r\nthe House of Representatives was concerned. But at last the President and\r\nSenate acquired the territory without asking the House of Representatives\r\nanything about it, and took it without that prohibition. They have the\r\npower of acquiring territory without the immediate representatives of the\r\npeople being called upon to say anything about it, and thus furnishing a\r\nvery apt and powerful means of bringing new territory into the Union,\r\nand, when it is once brought into the country, involving us anew in this\r\nslavery agitation. It is therefore, as I think, a very important question\r\nfor due consideration of the American people, whether the policy of\r\nbringing in additional territory, without considering at all how it\r\nwill operate upon the safety of the Union in reference to this one great\r\ndisturbing element in our national politics, shall be adopted as the\r\npolicy of the country. You will bear in mind that it is to be acquired,\r\naccording to the Judge's view, as fast as it is needed, and the indefinite\r\npart of this proposition is that we have only Judge Douglas and his class\r\nof men to decide how fast it is needed. We have no clear and certain\r\nway of determining or demonstrating how fast territory is needed by the\r\nnecessities of the country. Whoever wants to go out filibustering, then,\r\nthinks that more territory is needed. Whoever wants wider slave-fields\r\nfeels sure that some additional territory is needed as slave territory.\r\nThen it is as easy to show the necessity of additional slave-territory\r\nas it is to assert anything that is incapable of absolute demonstration.\r\nWhatever motive a man or a set of men may have for making annexation of\r\nproperty or territory, it is very easy to assert, but much less easy to\r\ndisprove, that it is necessary for the wants of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd now it only remains for me to say that I think it is a very grave\r\nquestion for the people of this Union to consider, whether, in view of\r\nthe fact that this slavery question has been the only one that has\r\never endangered our Republican institutions, the only one that has ever\r\nthreatened or menaced a dissolution of the Union, that has ever disturbed\r\nus in such a way as to make us fear for the perpetuity of our liberty,--in\r\nview of these facts, I think it is an exceedingly interesting and\r\nimportant question for this people to consider whether we shall engage in\r\nthe policy of acquiring additional territory, discarding altogether from\r\nour consideration, while obtaining new territory, the question how it may\r\naffect us in regard to this, the only endangering element to our liberties\r\nand national greatness. The Judge's view has been expressed. I, in my\r\nanswer to his question, have expressed mine. I think it will become an\r\nimportant and practical question. Our views are before the public. I am\r\nwilling and anxious that they should consider them fully; that they should\r\nturn it about and consider the importance of the question, and arrive at\r\na just conclusion as to whether it is or is not wise in the people of this\r\nUnion, in the acquisition of new territory, to consider whether it will\r\nadd to the disturbance that is existing amongst us--whether it will add to\r\nthe one only danger that has ever threatened the perpetuity of the Union\r\nor our own liberties. I think it is extremely important that they shall\r\ndecide, and rightly decide, that question before entering upon that\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my friends, having said the little I wish to say upon this head,\r\nwhether I have occupied the whole of the remnant of my time or not, I\r\nbelieve I could not enter upon any new topic so as to treat it fully,\r\nwithout transcending my time, which I would not for a moment think of\r\ndoing. I give way to Judge Douglas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH JOINT DEBATE, AT QUINCY, OCTOBER 13, 1858.\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: I have had no immediate conference with Judge\r\nDouglas, but I will venture to say that he and I will perfectly agree that\r\nyour entire silence, both when I speak and when he speaks, will be most\r\nagreeable to us.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, 1856, the elements in the State of Illinois which\r\nhave since been consolidated into the Republican party assembled together\r\nin a State Convention at Bloomington. They adopted at that time what, in\r\npolitical language, is called a platform. In June of the same year the\r\nelements of the Republican party in the nation assembled together in\r\na National Convention at Philadelphia. They adopted what is called the\r\nNational Platform. In June, 1858,--the present year,--the Republicans\r\nof Illinois reassembled at Springfield, in State Convention, and adopted\r\nagain their platform, as I suppose not differing in any essential\r\nparticular from either of the former ones, but perhaps adding something in\r\nrelation to the new developments of political progress in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Convention that assembled in June last did me the honor, if it be one,\r\nand I esteem it such, to nominate me as their candidate for the United\r\nStates Senate. I have supposed that, in entering upon this canvass, I\r\nstood generally upon these platforms. We are now met together on the 13th\r\nof October of the same year, only four months from the adoption of the\r\nlast platform, and I am unaware that in this canvass, from the beginning\r\nuntil to-day, any one of our adversaries has taken hold of our platforms,\r\nor laid his finger upon anything that he calls wrong in them.\r\n\r\nIn the very first one of these joint discussions between Senator Douglas\r\nand myself, Senator Douglas, without alluding at all to these platforms,\r\nor any one of them, of which I have spoken, attempted to hold me\r\nresponsible for a set of resolutions passed long before the meeting of\r\neither one of these conventions of which I have spoken. And as a ground\r\nfor holding me responsible for these resolutions, he assumed that they had\r\nbeen passed at a State Convention of the Republican party, and that I\r\ntook part in that Convention. It was discovered afterward that this was\r\nerroneous, that the resolutions which he endeavored to hold me responsible\r\nfor had not been passed by any State Convention anywhere, had not been\r\npassed at Springfield, where he supposed they had, or assumed that they\r\nhad, and that they had been passed in no convention in which I had taken\r\npart. The Judge, nevertheless, was not willing to give up the point that\r\nhe was endeavoring to make upon me, and he therefore thought to still\r\nhold me to the point that he was endeavoring to make, by showing that\r\nthe resolutions that he read had been passed at a local convention in the\r\nnorthern part of the State, although it was not a local convention that\r\nembraced my residence at all, nor one that reached, as I suppose, nearer\r\nthan one hundred and fifty or two hundred miles of where I was when it\r\nmet, nor one in which I took any part at all. He also introduced other\r\nresolutions, passed at other meetings, and by combining the whole,\r\nalthough they were all antecedent to the two State Conventions and the one\r\nNational Convention I have mentioned, still he insisted, and now insists,\r\nas I understand, that I am in some way responsible for them.\r\n\r\nAt Jonesboro, on our third meeting, I insisted to the Judge that I was\r\nin no way rightfully held responsible for the proceedings of this local\r\nmeeting or convention, in which I had taken no part, and in which I was\r\nin no way embraced; but I insisted to him that if he thought I was\r\nresponsible for every man or every set of men everywhere, who happen to\r\nbe my friends, the rule ought to work both ways, and he ought to be\r\nresponsible for the acts and resolutions of all men or sets of men who\r\nwere or are now his supporters and friends, and gave him a pretty\r\nlong string of resolutions, passed by men who are now his friends, and\r\nannouncing doctrines for which he does not desire to be held responsible.\r\n\r\nThis still does not satisfy Judge Douglas. He still adheres to his\r\nproposition, that I am responsible for what some of my friends in\r\ndifferent parts of the State have done, but that he is not responsible\r\nfor what his have done. At least, so I understand him. But in addition to\r\nthat, the Judge, at our meeting in Galesburgh, last week, undertakes to\r\nestablish that I am guilty of a species of double dealing with the\r\npublic; that I make speeches of a certain sort in the north, among the\r\nAbolitionists, which I would not make in the south, and that I make\r\nspeeches of a certain sort in the south which I would not make in the\r\nnorth. I apprehend, in the course I have marked out for myself, that I\r\nshall not have to dwell at very great length upon this subject.\r\n\r\nAs this was done in the Judge's opening speech at Galesburgh, I had an\r\nopportunity, as I had the middle speech then, of saying something in\r\nanswer to it. He brought forward a quotation or two from a speech of mine\r\ndelivered at Chicago, and then, to contrast with it, he brought forward an\r\nextract from a speech of mine at Charleston, in which he insisted that I\r\nwas greatly inconsistent, and insisted that his conclusion followed, that\r\nI was playing a double part, and speaking in one region one way, and in\r\nanother region another way. I have not time now to dwell on this as long\r\nas I would like, and wish only now to requote that portion of my speech\r\nat Charleston which the Judge quoted, and then make some comments upon\r\nit. This he quotes from me as being delivered at Charleston, and I believe\r\ncorrectly:\r\n\r\n\"I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing\r\nabout in any way the social and political equality of the white and black\r\nraces; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters\r\nor jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to\r\nintermarry with white people; and I will say, in addition to this, that\r\nthere is a physical difference between the white and black races which\r\nwill forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and\r\npolitical equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do\r\nremain together, there must be the position of superior and inferior. I am\r\nas much as any other man in favor of having the superior position assigned\r\nto the white race.\"\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, is the entire quotation from Charleston speech, as Judge\r\nDouglas made it his comments are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here you find men who hurrah for Lincoln, and say he is right when\r\nhe discards all distinction between races, or when he declares that\r\nhe discards the doctrine that there is such a thing as a superior and\r\ninferior race; and Abolitionists are required and expected to vote for\r\nMr. Lincoln because he goes for the equality of races, holding that in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence the white man and negro were declared equal,\r\nand endowed by divine law with equality. And down South, with the old-line\r\nWhigs, with the Kentuckians, the Virginians and the Tennesseeans, he tells\r\nyou that there is a physical difference between the races, making the\r\none superior, the other inferior, and he is in favor of maintaining the\r\nsuperiority of the white race over the negro.\"\r\n\r\nThose are the Judges comments. Now, I wish to show you that a month,\r\nor only lacking three days of a month, before I made the speech at\r\nCharleston, which the Judge quotes from, he had himself heard me say\r\nsubstantially the same thing It was in our first meeting, at Ottawa--and I\r\nwill say a word about where it was, and the atmosphere it was in, after a\r\nwhile--but at our first meeting, at Ottawa, I read an extract from an\r\nold speech of mine, made nearly four years ago, not merely to show my\r\nsentiments, but to show that my sentiments were long entertained and\r\nopenly expressed; in which extract I expressly declared that my own\r\nfeelings would not admit a social and political equality between the white\r\nand black races, and that even if my own feelings would admit of it, I\r\nstill knew that the public sentiment of the country would not, and that\r\nsuch a thing was an utter impossibility, or substantially that. That\r\nextract from my old speech the reporters by some sort of accident passed\r\nover, and it was not reported. I lay no blame upon anybody. I suppose they\r\nthought that I would hand it over to them, and dropped reporting while I\r\nwas giving it, but afterward went away without getting it from me. At the\r\nend of that quotation from my old speech, which I read at Ottawa, I made\r\nthe comments which were reported at that time, and which I will now read,\r\nand ask you to notice how very nearly they are the same as Judge Douglas\r\nsays were delivered by me down in Egypt. After reading, I added these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any great length; but this is the\r\ntrue complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution of\r\nslavery or the black race, and this is the whole of it: anything that\r\nargues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the\r\nnegro, is but a specious and fantastical arrangement of words by which a\r\nman can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse. I will say here,\r\nwhile upon this subject, that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly,\r\nto interfere with the institution in the States where it exists. I believe\r\nI have no right to do so. I have no inclination to do so. I have no\r\npurpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and\r\nblack races. There is a physical difference between the two which, in\r\nmy judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together on the\r\nfooting of perfect equality; and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that\r\nthere must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of\r\nthe race to which I belong having the superior position. I have never said\r\nanything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there\r\nis no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the\r\nrights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence,--the right of life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as much entitled\r\nto these as the white man. I agree with Judge Douglas that he is not\r\nmy equal in many respects, certainly not in color, perhaps not in\r\nintellectual and moral endowments; but in the right to eat the bread,\r\nwithout the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my\r\nequal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every other man.\"\r\n\r\nI have chiefly introduced this for the purpose of meeting the Judge's\r\ncharge that the quotation he took from my Charleston speech was what I\r\nwould say down South among the Kentuckians, the Virginians, etc., but\r\nwould not say in the regions in which was supposed to be more of the\r\nAbolition element. I now make this comment: That speech from which I have\r\nnow read the quotation, and which is there given correctly--perhaps too\r\nmuch so for good taste--was made away up North in the Abolition District\r\nof this State par excellence, in the Lovejoy District, in the personal\r\npresence of Lovejoy, for he was on the stand with us when I made it. It\r\nhad been made and put in print in that region only three days less than\r\na month before the speech made at Charleston, the like of which Judge\r\nDouglas thinks I would not make where there was any Abolition element.\r\nI only refer to this matter to say that I am altogether unconscious of\r\nhaving attempted any double-dealing anywhere; that upon one occasion I may\r\nsay one thing, and leave other things unsaid, and vice versa, but that I\r\nhave said anything on one occasion that is inconsistent with what I have\r\nsaid elsewhere, I deny, at least I deny it so far as the intention is\r\nconcerned. I find that I have devoted to this topic a larger portion of my\r\ntime than I had intended. I wished to show, but I will pass it upon this\r\noccasion, that in the sentiment I have occasionally advanced upon the\r\nDeclaration of Independence I am entirely borne out by the sentiments\r\nadvanced by our old Whig leader, Henry Clay, and I have the book here to\r\nshow it from but because I have already occupied more time than I intended\r\nto do on that topic, I pass over it.\r\n\r\nAt Galesburgh, I tried to show that by the Dred Scott decision, pushed\r\nto its legitimate consequences, slavery would be established in all the\r\nStates as well as in the Territories. I did this because, upon a former\r\noccasion, I had asked Judge Douglas whether, if the Supreme Court should\r\nmake a decision declaring that the States had not the power to exclude\r\nslavery from their limits, he would adopt and follow that decision as a\r\nrule of political action; and because he had not directly answered that\r\nquestion, but had merely contented himself with sneering at it, I again\r\nintroduced it, and tried to show that the conclusion that I stated\r\nfollowed inevitably and logically from the proposition already decided\r\nby the court. Judge Douglas had the privilege of replying to me at\r\nGalesburgh, and again he gave me no direct answer as to whether he would\r\nor would not sustain such a decision if made. I give him his third chance\r\nto say yes or no. He is not obliged to do either, probably he will not do\r\neither; but I give him the third chance. I tried to show then that this\r\nresult, this conclusion, inevitably followed from the point already\r\ndecided by the court. The Judge, in his reply, again sneers at the thought\r\nof the court making any such decision, and in the course of his remarks\r\nupon this subject uses the language which I will now read. Speaking of me,\r\nthe Judge says:\r\n\r\n\"He goes on and insists that the Dred Scott decision would carry slavery\r\ninto the free States, notwithstanding the decision itself says the\r\ncontrary.\" And he adds:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln knows that there is no member of the Supreme Court that holds\r\nthat doctrine. He knows that every one of them in their opinions held the\r\nreverse.\"\r\n\r\nI especially introduce this subject again for the purpose of saying that\r\nI have the Dred Scott decision here, and I will thank Judge Douglas to lay\r\nhis finger upon the place in the entire opinions of the court where any\r\none of them \"says the contrary.\" It is very hard to affirm a negative with\r\nentire confidence. I say, however, that I have examined that decision with\r\na good deal of care, as a lawyer examines a decision and, so far as I have\r\nbeen able to do so, the court has nowhere in its opinions said that\r\nthe States have the power to exclude slavery, nor have they used other\r\nlanguage substantially that, I also say, so far as I can find, not one of\r\nthe concurring judges has said that the States can exclude slavery, nor\r\nsaid anything that was substantially that. The nearest approach that any\r\none of them has made to it, so far as I can find, was by Judge Nelson,\r\nand the approach he made to it was exactly, in substance, the Nebraska\r\nBill,--that the States had the exclusive power over the question of\r\nslavery, so far as they are not limited by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. I asked the question, therefore, if the non-concurring judges,\r\nMcLean or Curtis, had asked to get an express declaration that the States\r\ncould absolutely exclude slavery from their limits, what reason have we\r\nto believe that it would not have been voted down by the majority of the\r\njudges, just as Chase's amendment was voted down by Judge Douglas and his\r\ncompeers when it was offered to the Nebraska Bill.\r\n\r\nAlso, at Galesburgh, I said something in regard to those Springfield\r\nresolutions that Judge Douglas had attempted to use upon me at Ottawa, and\r\ncommented at some length upon the fact that they were, as presented,\r\nnot genuine. Judge Douglas in his reply to me seemed to be somewhat\r\nexasperated. He said he would never have believed that Abraham Lincoln, as\r\nhe kindly called me, would have attempted such a thing as I had attempted\r\nupon that occasion; and among other expressions which he used toward me,\r\nwas that I dared to say forgery, that I had dared to say forgery [turning\r\nto Judge Douglas]. Yes, Judge, I did dare to say forgery. But in this\r\npolitical canvass the Judge ought to remember that I was not the first\r\nwho dared to say forgery. At Jacksonville, Judge Douglas made a speech in\r\nanswer to something said by Judge Trumbull, and at the close of what\r\nhe said upon that subject, he dared to say that Trumbull had forged his\r\nevidence. He said, too, that he should not concern himself with Trumbull\r\nany more, but thereafter he should hold Lincoln responsible for the\r\nslanders upon him. When I met him at Charleston after that, although I\r\nthink that I should not have noticed the subject if he had not said he\r\nwould hold me responsible for it, I spread out before him the statements\r\nof the evidence that Judge Trumbull had used, and I asked Judge Douglas,\r\npiece by piece, to put his finger upon one piece of all that evidence that\r\nhe would say was a forgery! When I went through with each and every piece,\r\nJudge Douglas did not dare then to say that any piece of it was a forgery.\r\nSo it seems that there are some things that Judge Douglas dares to do, and\r\nsome that he dares not to do.\r\n\r\n[A voice: It is the same thing with you.]\r\n\r\nYes, sir, it is the same thing with me. I do dare to say forgery when it\r\nis true, and don't dare to say forgery when it is false. Now I will say\r\nhere to this audience and to Judge Douglas I have not dared to say he\r\ncommitted a forgery, and I never shall until I know it; but I did dare\r\nto say--just to suggest to the Judge--that a forgery had been committed,\r\nwhich by his own showing had been traced to him and two of his friends.\r\nI dared to suggest to him that he had expressly promised in one of his\r\npublic speeches to investigate that matter, and I dared to suggest to him\r\nthat there was an implied promise that when he investigated it he would\r\nmake known the result. I dared to suggest to the Judge that he could not\r\nexpect to be quite clear of suspicion of that fraud, for since the time\r\nthat promise was made he had been with those friends, and had not kept his\r\npromise in regard to the investigation and the report upon it. I am not\r\na very daring man, but I dared that much, Judge, and I am not much scared\r\nabout it yet. When the Judge says he would n't have believed of Abraham\r\nLincoln that he would have made such an attempt as that he reminds me of\r\nthe fact that he entered upon this canvass with the purpose to treat\r\nme courteously; that touched me somewhat. It sets me to thinking. I was\r\naware, when it was first agreed that Judge Douglas and I were to have\r\nthese seven joint discussions, that they were the successive acts of a\r\ndrama, perhaps I should say, to be enacted, not merely in the face of\r\naudiences like this, but in the face of the nation, and to some extent,\r\nby my relation to him, and not from anything in myself, in the face of the\r\nworld; and I am anxious that they should be conducted with dignity and in\r\nthe good temper which would be befitting the vast audiences before which\r\nit was conducted. But when Judge Douglas got home from Washington and made\r\nhis first speech in Chicago, the evening afterward I made some sort of\r\na reply to it. His second speech was made at Bloomington, in which he\r\ncommented upon my speech at Chicago and said that I had used language\r\ningeniously contrived to conceal my intentions, or words to that effect.\r\nNow, I understand that this is an imputation upon my veracity and my\r\ncandor. I do not know what the Judge understood by it, but in our first\r\ndiscussion, at Ottawa, he led off by charging a bargain, somewhat corrupt\r\nin its character, upon Trumbull and myself,--that we had entered into a\r\nbargain, one of the terms of which was that Trumbull was to Abolitionize\r\nthe old Democratic party, and I (Lincoln) was to Abolitionize the old Whig\r\nparty; I pretending to be as good an old-line Whig as ever. Judge Douglas\r\nmay not understand that he implicated my truthfulness and my honor when he\r\nsaid I was doing one thing and pretending another; and I misunderstood him\r\nif he thought he was treating me in a dignified way, as a man of honor and\r\ntruth, as he now claims he was disposed to treat me. Even after that time,\r\nat Galesburgh, when he brings forward an extract from a speech made at\r\nChicago and an extract from a speech made at Charleston, to prove that I\r\nwas trying to play a double part, that I was trying to cheat the public,\r\nand get votes upon one set of principles at one place, and upon another\r\nset of principles at another place,--I do not understand but what he\r\nimpeaches my honor, my veracity, and my candor; and because he does this,\r\nI do not understand that I am bound, if I see a truthful ground for it,\r\nto keep my hands off of him. As soon as I learned that Judge Douglas was\r\ndisposed to treat me in this way, I signified in one of my speeches that\r\nI should be driven to draw upon whatever of humble resources I might\r\nhave,--to adopt a new course with him. I was not entirely sure that I\r\nshould be able to hold my own with him, but I at least had the purpose\r\nmade to do as well as I could upon him; and now I say that I will not be\r\nthe first to cry \"Hold.\" I think it originated with the Judge, and when he\r\nquits, I probably will. But I shall not ask any favors at all. He asks\r\nme, or he asks the audience, if I wish to push this matter to the point of\r\npersonal difficulty. I tell him, no. He did not make a mistake, in one of\r\nhis early speeches, when he called me an \"amiable\" man, though perhaps he\r\ndid when he called me an \"intelligent\" man. It really hurts me very much\r\nto suppose that I have wronged anybody on earth. I again tell him, no! I\r\nvery much prefer, when this canvass shall be over, however it may result,\r\nthat we at least part without any bitter recollections of personal\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThe Judge, in his concluding speech at Galesburgh, says that I was pushing\r\nthis matter to a personal difficulty, to avoid the responsibility for the\r\nenormity of my principles. I say to the Judge and this audience, now, that\r\nI will again state our principles, as well as I hastily can, in all their\r\nenormity, and if the Judge hereafter chooses to confine himself to a war\r\nupon these principles, he will probably not find me departing from the\r\nsame course.\r\n\r\nWe have in this nation this element of domestic slavery. It is a matter of\r\nabsolute certainty that it is a disturbing element. It is the opinion\r\nof all the great men who have expressed an opinion upon it, that it is\r\na dangerous element. We keep up a controversy in regard to it. That\r\ncontroversy necessarily springs from difference of opinion; and if we can\r\nlearn exactly--can reduce to the lowest elements--what that difference\r\nof opinion is, we perhaps shall be better prepared for discussing the\r\ndifferent systems of policy that we would propose in regard to that\r\ndisturbing element. I suggest that the difference of opinion, reduced to\r\nits lowest of terms, is no other than the difference between the men who\r\nthink slavery a wrong and those who do not think it wrong. The Republican\r\nparty think it wrong; we think it is a moral, a social, and a political\r\nwrong. We think it as a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons\r\nor the States where it exists, but that it is a wrong in its tendency, to\r\nsay the least, that extends itself to the existence of the whole nation.\r\nBecause we think it wrong, we propose a course of policy that shall deal\r\nwith it as a wrong. We deal with it as with any other wrong, in so far as\r\nwe can prevent its growing any larger, and so deal with it that in the run\r\nof time there may be some promise of an end to it. We have a due regard to\r\nthe actual presence of it amongst us, and the difficulties of getting\r\nrid of it in any satisfactory way, and all the constitutional obligations\r\nthrown about it. I suppose that in reference both to its actual existence\r\nin the nation, and to our constitutional obligations, we have no right at\r\nall to disturb it in the States where it exists, and we profess that we\r\nhave no more inclination to disturb it than we have the right to do it.\r\nWe go further than that: we don't propose to disturb it where, in\r\none instance, we think the Constitution would permit us. We think the\r\nConstitution would permit us to disturb it in the District of Columbia.\r\nStill, we do not propose to do that, unless it should be in terms which\r\nI don't suppose the nation is very likely soon to agree to,--the terms of\r\nmaking the emancipation gradual, and compensating the unwilling owners.\r\nWhere we suppose we have the constitutional right, we restrain ourselves\r\nin reference to the actual existence of the institution and the\r\ndifficulties thrown about it. We also oppose it as an evil so far as it\r\nseeks to spread itself. We insist on the policy that shall restrict it\r\nto its present limits. We don't suppose that in doing this we violate\r\nanything due to the actual presence of the institution, or anything due to\r\nthe constitutional guaranties thrown around it.\r\n\r\nWe oppose the Dred Scott decision in a certain way, upon which I ought\r\nperhaps to address you a few words. We do not propose that when Dred Scott\r\nhas been decided to be a slave by the court, we, as a mob, will decide him\r\nto be free. We do not propose that, when any other one, or one thousand,\r\nshall be decided by that court to be slaves, we will in any violent way\r\ndisturb the rights of property thus settled; but we nevertheless do oppose\r\nthat decision as a political rule which shall be binding on the voter to\r\nvote for nobody who thinks it wrong, which shall be binding on the members\r\nof Congress or the President to favor no measure that does not actually\r\nconcur with the principles of that decision. We do not propose to be\r\nbound by it as a political rule in that way, because we think it lays the\r\nfoundation, not merely of enlarging and spreading out what we consider an\r\nevil, but it lays the foundation for spreading that evil into the States\r\nthemselves. We propose so resisting it as to have it reversed if we can,\r\nand a new judicial rule established upon this subject.\r\n\r\nI will add this: that if there be any man who does not believe that\r\nslavery is wrong in the three aspects which I have mentioned, or in any\r\none of them, that man is misplaced, and ought to leave us; while on the\r\nother hand, if there be any man in the Republican party who is impatient\r\nover the necessity springing from its actual presence, and is impatient of\r\nthe constitutional guaranties thrown around it, and would act in disregard\r\nof these, he too is misplaced, standing with us. He will find his place\r\nsomewhere else; for we have a due regard, so far as we are capable of\r\nunderstanding them, for all these things. This, gentlemen, as well as I\r\ncan give it, is a plain statement of our principles in all their enormity.\r\nI will say now that there is a sentiment in the country contrary to me,--a\r\nsentiment which holds that slavery is not wrong, and therefore it goes for\r\nthe policy that does not propose dealing with it as a wrong. That policy\r\nis the Democratic policy, and that sentiment is the Democratic sentiment.\r\nIf there be a doubt in the mind of any one of this vast audience that this\r\nis really the central idea of the Democratic party in relation to this\r\nsubject, I ask him to bear with me while I state a few things tending, as\r\nI think, to prove that proposition. In the first place, the leading man--I\r\nthink I may do my friend Judge Douglas the honor of calling him such\r\nadvocating the present Democratic policy never himself says it is wrong.\r\nHe has the high distinction, so far as I know, of never having said\r\nslavery is either right or wrong. Almost everybody else says one or the\r\nother, but the Judge never does. If there be a man in the Democratic party\r\nwho thinks it is wrong, and yet clings to that party, I suggest to him, in\r\nthe first place, that his leader don't talk as he does, for he never says\r\nthat it is wrong. In the second place, I suggest to him that if he will\r\nexamine the policy proposed to be carried forward, he will find that he\r\ncarefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it. If you\r\nwill examine the arguments that are made on it, you will find that every\r\none carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery.\r\nPerhaps that Democrat who says he is as much opposed to slavery as I am\r\nwill tell me that I am wrong about this. I wish him to examine his own\r\ncourse in regard to this matter a moment, and then see if his opinion will\r\nnot be changed a little. You say it is wrong; but don't you constantly\r\nobject to anybody else saying so? Do you not constantly argue that this\r\nis not the right place to oppose it? You say it must not be opposed in the\r\nfree States, because slavery is not here; it must not be opposed in the\r\nslave States, because it is there; it must not be opposed in politics,\r\nbecause that will make a fuss; it must not be opposed in the pulpit,\r\nbecause it is not religion. Then where is the place to oppose it? There is\r\nno suitable place to oppose it. There is no place in the country to oppose\r\nthis evil overspreading the continent, which you say yourself is\r\ncoming. Frank Blair and Gratz Brown tried to get up a system of gradual\r\nemancipation in Missouri, had an election in August, and got beat, and\r\nyou, Mr. Democrat, threw up your hat, and hallooed \"Hurrah for Democracy!\"\r\nSo I say, again, that in regard to the arguments that are made, when Judge\r\nDouglas Says he \"don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down,\"\r\nwhether he means that as an individual expression of sentiment, or only as\r\na sort of statement of his views on national policy, it is alike true to\r\nsay that he can thus argue logically if he don't see anything wrong in\r\nit; but he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong. He\r\ncannot say that he would as soon see a wrong voted up as voted down. When\r\nJudge Douglas says that whoever or whatever community wants slaves, they\r\nhave a right to have them, he is perfectly logical, if there is nothing\r\nwrong in the institution; but if you admit that it is wrong, he cannot\r\nlogically say that anybody has a right to do wrong. When he says that\r\nslave property and horse and hog property are alike to be allowed to go\r\ninto the Territories, upon the principles of equality, he is reasoning\r\ntruly, if there is no difference between them as property; but if the\r\none is property held rightfully, and the other is wrong, then there is no\r\nequality between the right and wrong; so that, turn it in anyway you can,\r\nin all the arguments sustaining the Democratic policy, and in that policy\r\nitself, there is a careful, studied exclusion of the idea that there is\r\nanything wrong in slavery. Let us understand this. I am not, just here,\r\ntrying to prove that we are right, and they are wrong. I have been stating\r\nwhere we and they stand, and trying to show what is the real difference\r\nbetween us; and I now say that whenever we can get the question distinctly\r\nstated, can get all these men who believe that slavery is in some of these\r\nrespects wrong to stand and act with us in treating it as a wrong,--then,\r\nand not till then, I think we will in some way come to an end of this\r\nslavery agitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN'S REJOINDER.\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS:--Since Judge Douglas has said to you in his conclusion that he\r\nhad not time in an hour and a half to answer all I had said in an hour,\r\nit follows of course that I will not be able to answer in half an hour all\r\nthat he said in an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nI wish to return to Judge Douglas my profound thanks for his public\r\nannunciation here to-day, to be put on record, that his system of policy\r\nin regard to the institution of slavery contemplates that it shall\r\nlast forever. We are getting a little nearer the true issue of this\r\ncontroversy, and I am profoundly grateful for this one sentence. Judge\r\nDouglas asks you, Why cannot the institution of slavery, or rather, why\r\ncannot the nation, part slave and part free, continue as our fathers made\r\nit, forever? In the first place, I insist that our fathers did not make\r\nthis nation half slave and half free, or part slave and part free. I\r\ninsist that they found the institution of slavery existing here. They did\r\nnot make it so but they left it so because they knew of no way to get rid\r\nof it at that time. When Judge Douglas undertakes to say that, as a matter\r\nof choice, the fathers of the government made this nation part slave and\r\npart free, he assumes what is historically a falsehood. More than that:\r\nwhen the fathers of the government cut off the source of slavery by the\r\nabolition of the slave-trade, and adopted a system of restricting it from\r\nthe new Territories where it had not existed, I maintain that they placed\r\nit where they understood, and all sensible men understood, it was in\r\nthe course of ultimate extinction; and when Judge Douglas asks me why it\r\ncannot continue as our fathers made it, I ask him why he and his friends\r\ncould not let it remain as our fathers made it?\r\n\r\nIt is precisely all I ask of him in relation to the institution of\r\nslavery, that it shall be placed upon the basis that our fathers placed it\r\nupon. Mr. Brooks, of South Carolina, once said, and truly said, that\r\nwhen this government was established, no one expected the institution\r\nof slavery to last until this day, and that the men who formed this\r\ngovernment were wiser and better than the men of these days; but the\r\nmen of these days had experience which the fathers had not, and that\r\nexperience had taught them the invention of the cotton-gin, and this had\r\nmade the perpetuation of the institution of slavery a necessity in this\r\ncountry. Judge Douglas could not let it stand upon the basis which our\r\nfathers placed it, but removed it, and put it upon the cotton-gin basis.\r\nIt is a question, therefore, for him and his friends to answer, why they\r\ncould not let it remain where the fathers of the government originally\r\nplaced it. I hope nobody has understood me as trying to sustain the\r\ndoctrine that we have a right to quarrel with Kentucky, or Virginia, or\r\nany of the slave States, about the institution of slavery,--thus giving\r\nthe Judge an opportunity to be eloquent and valiant against us in fighting\r\nfor their rights. I expressly declared in my opening speech that I had\r\nneither the inclination to exercise, nor the belief in the existence of,\r\nthe right to interfere with the States of Kentucky or Virginia in doing\r\nas they pleased with slavery Or any other existing institution. Then what\r\nbecomes of all his eloquence in behalf of the rights of States, which are\r\nassailed by no living man?\r\n\r\nBut I have to hurry on, for I have but a half hour. The Judge has informed\r\nme, or informed this audience, that the Washington Union is laboring for\r\nmy election to the United States Senate. This is news to me,--not very\r\nungrateful news either. [Turning to Mr. W. H. Carlin, who was on the\r\nstand]--I hope that Carlin will be elected to the State Senate, and\r\nwill vote for me. [Mr. Carlin shook his head.] Carlin don't fall in, I\r\nperceive, and I suppose he will not do much for me; but I am glad of all\r\nthe support I can get, anywhere, if I can get it without practicing\r\nany deception to obtain it. In respect to this large portion of Judge\r\nDouglas's speech in which he tries to show that in the controversy between\r\nhimself and the Administration party he is in the right, I do not feel\r\nmyself at all competent or inclined to answer him. I say to him, \"Give it\r\nto them,--give it to them just all you can!\" and, on the other hand, I\r\nsay to Carlin, and Jake Davis, and to this man Wogley up here in Hancock,\r\n\"Give it to Douglas, just pour it into him!\"\r\n\r\nNow, in regard to this matter of the Dred Scott decision, I wish to say a\r\nword or two. After all, the Judge will not say whether, if a decision is\r\nmade holding that the people of the States cannot exclude slavery, he will\r\nsupport it or not. He obstinately refuses to say what he will do in that\r\ncase. The judges of the Supreme Court as obstinately refused to say\r\nwhat they would do on this subject. Before this I reminded him that at\r\nGalesburgh he said the judges had expressly declared the contrary, and you\r\nremember that in my Opening speech I told him I had the book containing\r\nthat decision here, and I would thank him to lay his finger on the place\r\nwhere any such thing was said. He has occupied his hour and a half, and he\r\nhas not ventured to try to sustain his assertion. He never will. But he is\r\ndesirous of knowing how we are going to reverse that Dred Scott decision.\r\nJudge Douglas ought to know how. Did not he and his political friends\r\nfind a way to reverse the decision of that same court in favor of the\r\nconstitutionality of the National Bank? Didn't they find a way to do it so\r\neffectually that they have reversed it as completely as any decision ever\r\nwas reversed, so far as its practical operation is concerned?\r\n\r\nAnd let me ask you, did n't Judge Douglas find a way to reverse the\r\ndecision of our Supreme Court when it decided that Carlin's father--old\r\nGovernor Carlin had not the constitutional power to remove a Secretary of\r\nState? Did he not appeal to the \"MOBS,\" as he calls them? Did he not make\r\nspeeches in the lobby to show how villainous that decision was, and how it\r\nought to be overthrown? Did he not succeed, too, in getting an act passed\r\nby the Legislature to have it overthrown? And did n't he himself sit down\r\non that bench as one of the five added judges, who were to overslaugh the\r\nfour old ones, getting his name of \"judge\" in that way, and no other? If\r\nthere is a villainy in using disrespect or making opposition to Supreme\r\nCourt decisions, I commend it to Judge Douglas's earnest consideration.\r\nI know of no man in the State of Illinois who ought to know so well about\r\nhow much villainy it takes to oppose a decision of the Supreme Court as\r\nour honorable friend Stephen A. Douglas.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas also makes the declaration that I say the Democrats are\r\nbound by the Dred Scott decision, while the Republicans are not. In the\r\nsense in which he argues, I never said it; but I will tell you what I have\r\nsaid and what I do not hesitate to repeat to-day. I have said that as the\r\nDemocrats believe that decision to be correct, and that the extension\r\nof slavery is affirmed in the National Constitution, they are bound to\r\nsupport it as such; and I will tell you here that General Jackson once\r\nsaid each man was bound to support the Constitution \"as he understood\r\nit.\" Now, Judge Douglas understands the Constitution according to the\r\nDred Scott decision, and he is bound to support it as he understands it.\r\nI understand it another way, and therefore I am bound to support it in the\r\nway in which I understand it. And as Judge Douglas believes that decision\r\nto be correct, I will remake that argument if I have time to do so. Let me\r\ntalk to some gentleman down there among you who looks me in the face. We\r\nwill say you are a member of the Territorial Legislature, and, like Judge\r\nDouglas, you believe that the right to take and hold slaves there is a\r\nconstitutional right The first thing you do is to swear you will support\r\nthe Constitution, and all rights guaranteed therein; that you\r\nwill, whenever your neighbor needs your legislation to support his\r\nconstitutional rights, not withhold that legislation. If you withhold\r\nthat necessary legislation for the support of the Constitution and\r\nconstitutional rights, do you not commit perjury? I ask every sensible man\r\nif that is not so? That is undoubtedly just so, say what you please. Now,\r\nthat is precisely what Judge Douglas says, that this is a constitutional\r\nright. Does the Judge mean to say that the Territorial Legislature in\r\nlegislating may, by withholding necessary laws, or by passing unfriendly\r\nlaws, nullify that constitutional right? Does he mean to say that? Does he\r\nmean to ignore the proposition so long and well established in law, that\r\nwhat you cannot do directly, you cannot do indirectly? Does he mean that?\r\nThe truth about the matter is this: Judge Douglas has sung paeans to his\r\n\"Popular Sovereignty\" doctrine until his Supreme Court, co-operating with\r\nhim, has squatted his Squatter Sovereignty out. But he will keep up this\r\nspecies of humbuggery about Squatter Sovereignty. He has at last invented\r\nthis sort of do-nothing sovereignty,--that the people may exclude slavery\r\nby a sort of \"sovereignty\" that is exercised by doing nothing at all. Is\r\nnot that running his Popular Sovereignty down awfully? Has it not got down\r\nas thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a\r\npigeon that had starved to death? But at last, when it is brought to the\r\ntest of close reasoning, there is not even that thin decoction of it left.\r\nIt is a presumption impossible in the domain of thought. It is precisely\r\nno other than the putting of that most unphilosophical proposition, that\r\ntwo bodies can occupy the same space at the same time. The Dred Scott\r\ndecision covers the whole ground, and while it occupies it, there is no\r\nroom even for the shadow of a starved pigeon to occupy the same ground.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas, in reply to what I have said about having upon a previous\r\noccasion made the speech at Ottawa as the one he took an extract from at\r\nCharleston, says it only shows that I practiced the deception twice. Now,\r\nmy friends, are any of you obtuse enough to swallow that? Judge Douglas\r\nhad said I had made a speech at Charleston that I would not make up north,\r\nand I turned around and answered him by showing I had made that same\r\nspeech up north,--had made it at Ottawa; made it in his hearing; made\r\nit in the Abolition District,--in Lovejoy's District,--in the personal\r\npresence of Lovejoy himself,--in the same atmosphere exactly in which I\r\nhad made my Chicago speech, of which he complains so much.\r\n\r\nNow, in relation to my not having said anything about the quotation from\r\nthe Chicago speech: he thinks that is a terrible subject for me to handle.\r\nWhy, gentlemen, I can show you that the substance of the Chicago speech\r\nI delivered two years ago in \"Egypt,\" as he calls it. It was down at\r\nSpringfield. That speech is here in this book, and I could turn to it and\r\nread it to you but for the lack of time. I have not now the time to read\r\nit. [\"Read it, read it.\"] No, gentlemen, I am obliged to use discretion in\r\ndisposing most advantageously of my brief time. The Judge has taken great\r\nexception to my adopting the heretical statement in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, that \"all men are created equal,\" and he has a great deal to\r\nsay about negro equality. I want to say that in sometimes alluding to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, I have only uttered the sentiments that Henry\r\nClay used to hold. Allow me to occupy your time a moment with what he\r\nsaid. Mr. Clay was at one time called upon in Indiana, and in a way that I\r\nsuppose was very insulting, to liberate his slaves; and he made a written\r\nreply to that application, and one portion of it is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"What is the foundation of this appeal to me in Indiana to liberate the\r\nslaves under my care in Kentucky? It is a general declaration in the\r\nact announcing to the world the independence of the thirteen American\r\ncolonies, that men are created equal. Now, as an abstract principle, there\r\nis no doubt of the truth of that declaration, and it is desirable in the\r\noriginal construction of society, and in organized societies, to keep it\r\nin view as a great fundamental principle.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I sometimes, in relation to the organization of new societies in new\r\ncountries, where the soil is clean and clear, insisted that we should keep\r\nthat principle in view, Judge Douglas will have it that I want a negro\r\nwife. He never can be brought to understand that there is any middle\r\nground on this subject. I have lived until my fiftieth year, and have\r\nnever had a negro woman either for a slave or a wife, and I think I can\r\nlive fifty centuries, for that matter, without having had one for either.\r\nI maintain that you may take Judge Douglas's quotations from my Chicago\r\nspeech, and from my Charleston speech, and the Galesburgh speech,--in his\r\nspeech of to-day,--and compare them over, and I am willing to trust them\r\nwith you upon his proposition that they show rascality or double-dealing.\r\nI deny that they do.\r\n\r\nThe Judge does not seem at all disposed to have peace, but I find he is\r\ndisposed to have a personal warfare with me. He says that my oath would\r\nnot be taken against the bare word of Charles H. Lanphier or Thomas L.\r\nHarris. Well, that is altogether a matter of opinion. It is certainly not\r\nfor me to vaunt my word against oaths of these gentlemen, but I will tell\r\nJudge Douglas again the facts upon which I \"dared\" to say they proved\r\na forgery. I pointed out at Galesburgh that the publication of these\r\nresolutions in the Illinois State Register could not have been the result\r\nof accident, as the proceedings of that meeting bore unmistakable\r\nevidence of being done by a man who knew it was a forgery; that it was a\r\npublication partly taken from the real proceedings of the Convention, and\r\npartly from the proceedings of a convention at another place, which showed\r\nthat he had the real proceedings before him, and taking one part of\r\nthe resolutions, he threw out another part, and substituted false and\r\nfraudulent ones in their stead. I pointed that out to him, and also that\r\nhis friend Lanphier, who was editor of the Register at that time and now\r\nis, must have known how it was done. Now, whether he did it, or got some\r\nfriend to do it for him, I could not tell, but he certainly knew all about\r\nit. I pointed out to Judge Douglas that in his Freeport speech he had\r\npromised to investigate that matter. Does he now say that he did not make\r\nthat promise? I have a right to ask why he did not keep it. I call upon\r\nhim to tell here to-day why he did not keep that promise? That fraud has\r\nbeen traced up so that it lies between him, Harris, and Lanphier. There\r\nis little room for escape for Lanphier. Lanphier is doing the Judge\r\ngood service, and Douglas desires his word to be taken for the truth.\r\nHe desires Lanphier to be taken as authority in what he states in his\r\nnewspaper. He desires Harris to be taken as a man of vast credibility; and\r\nwhen this thing lies among them, they will not press it to show where the\r\nguilt really belongs. Now, as he has said that he would investigate it,\r\nand implied that he would tell us the result of his investigation, I\r\ndemand of him to tell why he did not investigate it, if he did not; and if\r\nhe did, why he won't tell the result. I call upon him for that.\r\n\r\nThis is the third time that Judge Douglas has assumed that he learned\r\nabout these resolutions by Harris's attempting to use them against Norton\r\non the floor of Congress. I tell Judge Douglas the public records of the\r\ncountry show that he himself attempted it upon Trumbull a month before\r\nHarris tried them on Norton; that Harris had the opportunity of learning\r\nit from him, rather than he from Harris. I now ask his attention to that\r\npart of the record on the case. My friends, I am not disposed to detain\r\nyou longer in regard to that matter.\r\n\r\nI am told that I still have five minutes left. There is another matter I\r\nwish to call attention to. He says, when he discovered there was a mistake\r\nin that case, he came forward magnanimously, without my calling his\r\nattention to it, and explained it. I will tell you how he became so\r\nmagnanimous. When the newspapers of our side had discovered and published\r\nit, and put it beyond his power to deny it, then he came forward and made\r\na virtue of necessity by acknowledging it. Now he argues that all\r\nthe point there was in those resolutions, although never passed at\r\nSpringfield, is retained by their being passed at other localities. Is\r\nthat true? He said I had a hand in passing them, in his opening speech,\r\nthat I was in the convention and helped to pass them. Do the resolutions\r\ntouch me at all? It strikes me there is some difference between holding\r\na man responsible for an act which he has not done and holding him\r\nresponsible for an act that he has done. You will judge whether there\r\nis any difference in the \"spots.\" And he has taken credit for great\r\nmagnanimity in coming forward and acknowledging what is proved on him\r\nbeyond even the capacity of Judge Douglas to deny; and he has more\r\ncapacity in that way than any other living man.\r\n\r\nThen he wants to know why I won't withdraw the charge in regard to a\r\nconspiracy to make slavery national, as he has withdrawn the one he made.\r\nMay it please his worship, I will withdraw it when it is proven false on\r\nme as that was proven false on him. I will add a little more than that,\r\nI will withdraw it whenever a reasonable man shall be brought to believe\r\nthat the charge is not true. I have asked Judge Douglas's attention to\r\ncertain matters of fact tending to prove the charge of a conspiracy to\r\nnationalize slavery, and he says he convinces me that this is all untrue\r\nbecause Buchanan was not in the country at that time, and because the Dred\r\nScott case had not then got into the Supreme Court; and he says that I say\r\nthe Democratic owners of Dred Scott got up the case. I never did say that\r\nI defy Judge Douglas to show that I ever said so, for I never uttered\r\nit. [One of Mr. Douglas's reporters gesticulated affirmatively at Mr.\r\nLincoln.] I don't care if your hireling does say I did, I tell you myself\r\nthat I never said the \"Democratic\" owners of Dred Scott got up the case.\r\nI have never pretended to know whether Dred Scott's owners were Democrats,\r\nor Abolitionists, or Freesoilers or Border Ruffians. I have said that\r\nthere is evidence about the case tending to show that it was a made-up\r\ncase, for the purpose of getting that decision. I have said that that\r\nevidence was very strong in the fact that when Dred Scott was declared to\r\nbe a slave, the owner of him made him free, showing that he had had the\r\ncase tried and the question settled for such use as could be made of that\r\ndecision; he cared nothing about the property thus declared to be his by\r\nthat decision. But my time is out, and I can say no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST DEBATE, AT ALTON, OCTOBER 15, 1858\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN'S REPLY\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I have been somewhat, in my own mind, complimented\r\nby a large portion of Judge Douglas's speech,--I mean that portion\r\nwhich he devotes to the controversy between himself and the present\r\nAdministration. This is the seventh time Judge Douglas and myself have met\r\nin these joint discussions, and he has been gradually improving in regard\r\nto his war with the Administration. At Quincy, day before yesterday, he\r\nwas a little more severe upon the Administration than I had heard him upon\r\nany occasion, and I took pains to compliment him for it. I then told him\r\nto give it to them with all the power he had; and as some of them were\r\npresent, I told them I would be very much obliged if they would give it to\r\nhim in about the same way. I take it he has now vastly improved upon\r\nthe attack he made then upon the Administration. I flatter myself he has\r\nreally taken my advice on this subject. All I can say now is to re-commend\r\nto him and to them what I then commended,--to prosecute the war against\r\none another in the most vigorous manner. I say to them again: \"Go it,\r\nhusband!--Go it, bear!\"\r\n\r\nThere is one other thing I will mention before I leave this branch of the\r\ndiscussion,--although I do not consider it much of my business, anyway. I\r\nrefer to that part of the Judge's remarks where he undertakes to involve\r\nMr. Buchanan in an inconsistency. He reads something from Mr. Buchanan,\r\nfrom which he undertakes to involve him in an inconsistency; and he gets\r\nsomething of a cheer for having done so. I would only remind the Judge\r\nthat while he is very valiantly fighting for the Nebraska Bill and the\r\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise, it has been but a little while since\r\nhe was the valiant advocate of the Missouri Compromise. I want to know\r\nif Buchanan has not as much right to be inconsistent as Douglas has? Has\r\nDouglas the exclusive right, in this country, of being on all sides of\r\nall questions? Is nobody allowed that high privilege but himself? Is he to\r\nhave an entire monopoly on that subject?\r\n\r\nSo far as Judge Douglas addressed his speech to me, or so far as it was\r\nabout me, it is my business to pay some attention to it. I have heard the\r\nJudge state two or three times what he has stated to-day, that in a speech\r\nwhich I made at Springfield, Illinois, I had in a very especial manner\r\ncomplained that the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case had decided that\r\na negro could never be a citizen of the United States. I have omitted by\r\nsome accident heretofore to analyze this statement, and it is required\r\nof me to notice it now. In point of fact it is untrue. I never have\r\ncomplained especially of the Dred Scott decision because it held that a\r\nnegro could not be a citizen, and the Judge is always wrong when he says\r\nI ever did so complain of it. I have the speech here, and I will thank\r\nhim or any of his friends to show where I said that a negro should be a\r\ncitizen, and complained especially of the Dred Scott decision because\r\nit declared he could not be one. I have done no such thing; and Judge\r\nDouglas, so persistently insisting that I have done so, has strongly\r\nimpressed me with the belief of a predetermination on his part to\r\nmisrepresent me. He could not get his foundation for insisting that I\r\nwas in favor of this negro equality anywhere else as well as he could by\r\nassuming that untrue proposition. Let me tell this audience what is true\r\nin regard to that matter; and the means by which they may correct me if I\r\ndo not tell them truly is by a recurrence to the speech itself. I spoke\r\nof the Dred Scott decision in my Springfield speech, and I was then\r\nendeavoring to prove that the Dred Scott decision was a portion of a\r\nsystem or scheme to make slavery national in this country. I pointed out\r\nwhat things had been decided by the court. I mentioned as a fact that they\r\nhad decided that a negro could not be a citizen; that they had done so, as\r\nI supposed, to deprive the negro, under all circumstances, of the remotest\r\npossibility of ever becoming a citizen and claiming the rights of a\r\ncitizen of the United States under a certain clause of the Constitution. I\r\nstated that, without making any complaint of it at all. I then went on and\r\nstated the other points decided in the case; namely, that the bringing\r\nof a negro into the State of Illinois and holding him in slavery for two\r\nyears here was a matter in regard to which they would not decide whether\r\nit would make him free or not; that they decided the further point that\r\ntaking him into a United States Territory where slavery was prohibited by\r\nAct of Congress did not make him free, because that Act of Congress, as\r\nthey held, was unconstitutional. I mentioned these three things as making\r\nup the points decided in that case. I mentioned them in a lump, taken in\r\nconnection with the introduction of the Nebraska Bill, and the amendment\r\nof Chase, offered at the time, declaratory of the right of the people of\r\nthe Territories to exclude slavery, which was voted down by the friends\r\nof the bill. I mentioned all these things together, as evidence tending\r\nto prove a combination and conspiracy to make the institution of slavery\r\nnational. In that connection and in that way I mentioned the decision on\r\nthe point that a negro could not be a citizen, and in no other connection.\r\n\r\nOut of this Judge Douglas builds up his beautiful fabrication of my\r\npurpose to introduce a perfect social and political equality between the\r\nwhite and black races. His assertion that I made an \"especial objection\"\r\n(that is his exact language) to the decision on this account is untrue in\r\npoint of fact.\r\n\r\nNow, while I am upon this subject, and as Henry Clay has been alluded to,\r\nI desire to place myself, in connection with Mr. Clay, as nearly right\r\nbefore this people as may be. I am quite aware what the Judge's object\r\nis here by all these allusions. He knows that we are before an audience\r\nhaving strong sympathies southward, by relationship, place of birth, and\r\nso on. He desires to place me in an extremely Abolition attitude. He read\r\nupon a former occasion, and alludes, without reading, to-day to a portion\r\nof a speech which I delivered in Chicago. In his quotations from that\r\nspeech, as he has made them upon former occasions, the extracts were taken\r\nin such a way as, I suppose, brings them within the definition of what\r\nis called garbling,--taking portions of a speech which, when taken by\r\nthemselves, do not present the entire sense of the speaker as expressed at\r\nthe time. I propose, therefore, out of that same speech, to show how\r\none portion of it which he skipped over (taking an extract before and an\r\nextract after) will give a different idea, and the true idea I intended to\r\nconvey. It will take me some little time to read it, but I believe I will\r\noccupy the time that way.\r\n\r\nYou have heard him frequently allude to my controversy with him in regard\r\nto the Declaration of Independence. I confess that I have had a struggle\r\nwith Judge Douglas on that matter, and I will try briefly to place myself\r\nright in regard to it on this occasion. I said--and it is between\r\nthe extracts Judge Douglas has taken from this speech, and put in his\r\npublished speeches:\r\n\r\n\"It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities\r\nand impose them upon us, and to the extent that a necessity is imposed\r\nupon a man he must submit to it. I think that was the condition in which\r\nwe found ourselves when we established this government. We had slaves\r\namong us, we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted them\r\nto remain in slavery, we could not secure the good we did secure if we\r\ngrasped for more; and having by necessity submitted to that much, it does\r\nnot destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties. Let the\r\ncharter remain as our standard.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I have upon all occasions declared as strongly as Judge Douglas\r\nagainst the disposition to interfere with the existing institution of\r\nslavery. You hear me read it from the same speech from which he takes\r\ngarbled extracts for the purpose of proving upon me a disposition to\r\ninterfere with the institution of slavery, and establish a perfect social\r\nand political equality between negroes and white people.\r\n\r\nAllow me while upon this subject briefly to present one other extract from\r\na speech of mine, more than a year ago, at Springfield, in discussing this\r\nvery same question, soon after Judge Douglas took his ground that negroes\r\nwere, not included in the Declaration of Independence:\r\n\r\n\"I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all\r\nmen, but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects. They\r\ndid not mean to say all men were equal in color, size, intellect, moral\r\ndevelopment, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness\r\nin what they did consider all men created equal,--equal in certain\r\ninalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness. This they said, and this they meant. They did not mean to\r\nassert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that\r\nequality, or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them.\r\nIn fact they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to\r\ndeclare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as\r\ncircumstances should permit.\r\n\r\n\"They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be\r\nfamiliar to all,--constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even,\r\nthough never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby\r\nconstantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the\r\nhappiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nThere again are the sentiments I have expressed in regard to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence upon a former occasion,--sentiments which have\r\nbeen put in print and read wherever anybody cared to know what so humble\r\nan individual as myself chose to say in regard to it.\r\n\r\nAt Galesburgh, the other day, I said, in answer to Judge Douglas, that\r\nthree years ago there never had been a man, so far as I knew or believed,\r\nin the whole world, who had said that the Declaration of Independence did\r\nnot include negroes in the term \"all men.\" I reassert it to-day. I assert\r\nthat Judge Douglas and all his friends may search the whole records of the\r\ncountry, and it will be a matter of great astonishment to me if they shall\r\nbe able to find that one human being three years ago had ever uttered the\r\nastounding sentiment that the term \"all men\" in the Declaration did not\r\ninclude the negro. Do not let me be misunderstood. I know that more than\r\nthree years ago there were men who, finding this assertion constantly in\r\nthe way of their schemes to bring about the ascendency and perpetuation\r\nof slavery, denied the truth of it. I know that Mr. Calhoun and all the\r\npoliticians of his school denied the truth of the Declaration. I know\r\nthat it ran along in the mouth of some Southern men for a period of years,\r\nending at last in that shameful, though rather forcible, declaration of\r\nPettit of Indiana, upon the floor of the United States Senate, that the\r\nDeclaration of Independence was in that respect \"a self-evident lie,\"\r\nrather than a self-evident truth. But I say, with a perfect knowledge of\r\nall this hawking at the Declaration without directly attacking it, that\r\nthree years ago there never had lived a man who had ventured to assail it\r\nin the sneaking way of pretending to believe it, and then asserting it did\r\nnot include the negro. I believe the first man who ever said it was Chief\r\nJustice Taney in the Dred Scott case, and the next to him was our friend\r\nStephen A. Douglas. And now it has become the catchword of the entire\r\nparty. I would like to call upon his friends everywhere to consider how\r\nthey have come in so short a time to view this matter in a way so entirely\r\ndifferent from their former belief; to ask whether they are not being\r\nborne along by an irresistible current,--whither, they know not.\r\n\r\nIn answer to my proposition at Galesburgh last week, I see that some man\r\nin Chicago has got up a letter, addressed to the Chicago Times, to show,\r\nas he professes, that somebody had said so before; and he signs himself\r\n\"An Old-Line Whig,\" if I remember correctly. In the first place, I would\r\nsay he was not an old-line Whig. I am somewhat acquainted with old-line\r\nWhigs from the origin to the end of that party; I became pretty well\r\nacquainted with them, and I know they always had some sense, whatever else\r\nyou could ascribe to them. I know there never was one who had not more\r\nsense than to try to show by the evidence he produces that some men had,\r\nprior to the time I named, said that negroes were not included in the\r\nterm \"all men\" in the Declaration of Independence. What is the evidence\r\nhe produces? I will bring forward his evidence, and let you see what he\r\noffers by way of showing that somebody more than three years ago had said\r\nnegroes were not included in the Declaration. He brings forward part of a\r\nspeech from Henry Clay,--the part of the speech of Henry Clay which I\r\nused to bring forward to prove precisely the contrary. I guess we are\r\nsurrounded to some extent to-day by the old friends of Mr. Clay, and they\r\nwill be glad to hear anything from that authority. While he was in Indiana\r\na man presented a petition to liberate his negroes, and he (Mr. Clay) made\r\na speech in answer to it, which I suppose he carefully wrote out himself\r\nand caused to be published. I have before me an extract from that speech\r\nwhich constitutes the evidence this pretended \"Old-Line Whig\" at Chicago\r\nbrought forward to show that Mr. Clay did n't suppose the negro was\r\nincluded in the Declaration of Independence. Hear what Mr. Clay said:\r\n\r\n\"And what is the foundation of this appeal to me in Indiana to liberate\r\nthe slaves under my care in Kentucky? It is a general declaration in the\r\nact announcing to the world the independence of the thirteen American\r\ncolonies, that all men are created equal. Now, as an abstract principle,\r\nthere is no doubt of the truth of that declaration; and it is desirable,\r\nin the original construction of society and in organized societies, to\r\nkeep it in view as a great fundamental principle. But, then, I apprehend\r\nthat in no society that ever did exist, or ever shall be formed, was\r\nor can the equality asserted among the members of the human race be\r\npractically enforced and carried out. There are portions, large portions,\r\nwomen, minors, insane, culprits, transient sojourners, that will always\r\nprobably remain subject to the government of another portion of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\"That declaration, whatever may be the extent of its import, was made by\r\nthe delegations of the thirteen States. In most of them slavery existed,\r\nand had long existed, and was established by law. It was introduced and\r\nforced upon the colonies by the paramount law of England. Do you believe\r\nthat in making that declaration the States that concurred in it intended\r\nthat it should be tortured into a virtual emancipation of all the slaves\r\nwithin their respective limits? Would Virginia and other Southern States\r\nhave ever united in a declaration which was to be interpreted into an\r\nabolition of slavery among them? Did any one of the thirteen colonies\r\nentertain such a design or expectation? To impute such a secret and\r\nunavowed purpose, would be to charge a political fraud upon the noblest\r\nband of patriots that ever assembled in council,--a fraud upon the\r\nConfederacy of the Revolution; a fraud upon the union of those States\r\nwhose Constitution not only recognized the lawfulness of slavery, but\r\npermitted the importation of slaves from Africa until the year 1808.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the entire quotation brought forward to prove that somebody\r\nprevious to three years ago had said the negro was not included in the\r\nterm \"all men\" in the Declaration. How does it do so? In what way has it a\r\ntendency to prove that? Mr. Clay says it is true as an abstract principle\r\nthat all men are created equal, but that we cannot practically apply it in\r\nall eases. He illustrates this by bringing forward the cases of females,\r\nminors, and insane persons, with whom it cannot be enforced; but he says\r\nit is true as an abstract principle in the organization of society as well\r\nas in organized society and it should be kept in view as a fundamental\r\nprinciple. Let me read a few words more before I add some comments of my\r\nown. Mr. Clay says, a little further on:\r\n\r\n\"I desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of\r\nslavery. I look upon it as a great evil, and deeply lament that we have\r\nderived it from the parental government and from our ancestors. I wish\r\nevery slave in the United States was in the country of his ancestors. But\r\nhere they are, and the question is, How can they be best dealt with? If\r\na state of nature existed, and we were about to lay the foundations\r\nof society, no man would be more strongly opposed than I should be to\r\nincorporate the institution of slavery amongst its elements.\"\r\n\r\nNow, here in this same book, in this same speech, in this same extract,\r\nbrought forward to prove that Mr. Clay held that the negro was not\r\nincluded in the Declaration of Independence, is no such statement on\r\nhis part, but the declaration that it is a great fundamental truth which\r\nshould be constantly kept in view in the organization of society and in\r\nsocieties already organized. But if I say a word about it; if I attempt,\r\nas Mr. Clay said all good men ought to do, to keep it in view; if, in this\r\n\"organized society,\" I ask to have the public eye turned upon it; if I\r\nask, in relation to the organization of new Territories, that the public\r\neye should be turned upon it, forthwith I am vilified as you hear me\r\nto-day. What have I done that I have not the license of Henry Clay's\r\nillustrious example here in doing? Have I done aught that I have not his\r\nauthority for, while maintaining that in organizing new Territories and\r\nsocieties this fundamental principle should be regarded, and in organized\r\nsociety holding it up to the public view and recognizing what he\r\nrecognized as the great principle of free government?\r\n\r\nAnd when this new principle--this new proposition that no human being ever\r\nthought of three years ago--is brought forward, I combat it as having an\r\nevil tendency, if not an evil design. I combat it as having a tendency to\r\ndehumanize the negro, to take away from him the right of ever striving to\r\nbe a man. I combat it as being one of the thousand things constantly done\r\nin these days to prepare the public mind to make property, and nothing but\r\nproperty, of the negro in all the States of this Union.\r\n\r\nBut there is a point that I wish, before leaving this part of the\r\ndiscussion, to ask attention to. I have read and I repeat the words of\r\nHenry Clay:\r\n\r\n\"I desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of\r\nslavery. I look upon it as a great evil, and deeply lament that we have\r\nderived it from the parental government and from our ancestors. I wish\r\nevery slave in the United States was in the country of his ancestors. But\r\nhere they are, and the question is, How can they be best dealt with? If\r\na state of nature existed, and we were about to lay the foundations\r\nof society, no man would be more strongly opposed than I should be to\r\nincorporate the institution of slavery amongst its elements.\"\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which I have insisted in this canvass is in relation\r\nto laying the foundations of new societies. I have never sought to apply\r\nthese principles to the old States for the purpose of abolishing slavery\r\nin those States. It is nothing but a miserable perversion of what I have\r\nsaid, to assume that I have declared Missouri, or any other slave State,\r\nshall emancipate her slaves; I have proposed no such thing. But when Mr.\r\nClay says that in laying the foundations of society in our Territories\r\nwhere it does not exist, he would be opposed to the introduction of\r\nslavery as an element, I insist that we have his warrant--his license--for\r\ninsisting upon the exclusion of that element which he declared in such\r\nstrong and emphatic language was most hurtful to him.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas has again referred to a Springfield speech in which I said\r\n\"a house divided against itself cannot stand.\" The Judge has so often made\r\nthe entire quotation from that speech that I can make it from memory. I\r\nused this language:\r\n\r\n\"We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with\r\nthe avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slavery\r\nagitation. Under the operation of this policy, that agitation has not only\r\nnot ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion it will not\r\ncease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand.' I believe this government cannot endure\r\npermanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the house to fall,\r\nbut I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing,\r\nor all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further\r\nspread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief\r\nthat it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will\r\npush it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old\r\nas well as new, North as well as South.\"\r\n\r\nThat extract and the sentiments expressed in it have been extremely\r\noffensive to Judge Douglas. He has warred upon them as Satan wars upon the\r\nBible. His perversions upon it are endless. Here now are my views upon it\r\nin brief:\r\n\r\nI said we were now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated\r\nwith the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the\r\nslavery agitation. Is it not so? When that Nebraska Bill was brought\r\nforward four years ago last January, was it not for the \"avowed object\" of\r\nputting an end to the slavery agitation? We were to have no more agitation\r\nin Congress; it was all to be banished to the Territories. By the way, I\r\nwill remark here that, as Judge Douglas is very fond of complimenting Mr.\r\nCrittenden in these days, Mr. Crittenden has said there was a falsehood\r\nin that whole business, for there was no slavery agitation at that time to\r\nallay. We were for a little while quiet on the troublesome thing, and that\r\nvery allaying plaster of Judge Douglas's stirred it up again. But was it\r\nnot understood or intimated with the \"confident promise\" of putting an end\r\nto the slavery agitation? Surely it was. In every speech you heard Judge\r\nDouglas make, until he got into this \"imbroglio,\" as they call it, with\r\nthe Administration about the Lecompton Constitution, every speech on that\r\nNebraska Bill was full of his felicitations that we were just at the\r\nend of the slavery agitation. The last tip of the last joint of the old\r\nserpent's tail was just drawing out of view. But has it proved so? I have\r\nasserted that under that policy that agitation \"has not only not ceased,\r\nbut has constantly augmented.\" When was there ever a greater agitation in\r\nCongress than last winter? When was it as great in the country as to-day?\r\n\r\nThere was a collateral object in the introduction of that Nebraska policy,\r\nwhich was to clothe the people of the Territories with a superior degree\r\nof self-government, beyond what they had ever had before. The first\r\nobject and the main one of conferring upon the people a higher degree of\r\n\"self-government\" is a question of fact to be determined by you in answer\r\nto a single question. Have you ever heard or known of a people anywhere\r\non earth who had as little to do as, in the first instance of its use, the\r\npeople of Kansas had with this same right of \"self-government \"? In\r\nits main policy and in its collateral object, it has been nothing but a\r\nliving, creeping lie from the time of its introduction till to-day.\r\n\r\nI have intimated that I thought the agitation would not cease until a\r\ncrisis should have been reached and passed. I have stated in what way I\r\nthought it would be reached and passed. I have said that it might go one\r\nway or the other. We might, by arresting the further spread of it, and\r\nplacing it where the fathers originally placed it, put it where the public\r\nmind should rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction. Thus the agitation may cease. It may be pushed forward until\r\nit shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North\r\nas well as South. I have said, and I repeat, my wish is that the further\r\nspread of it may be arrested, and that it may be where the public\r\nmind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction--I have expressed that as my wish I entertain the opinion, upon\r\nevidence sufficient to my mind, that the fathers of this government placed\r\nthat institution where the public mind did rest in the belief that it was\r\nin the course of ultimate extinction. Let me ask why they made provision\r\nthat the source of slavery--the African slave-trade--should be cut off at\r\nthe end of twenty years? Why did they make provision that in all the new\r\nterritory we owned at that time slavery should be forever inhibited? Why\r\nstop its spread in one direction, and cut off its source in another,\r\nif they did not look to its being placed in the course of its ultimate\r\nextinction?\r\n\r\nAgain: the institution of slavery is only mentioned in the Constitution of\r\nthe United States two or three times, and in neither of these cases does\r\nthe word \"slavery\" or \"negro race\" occur; but covert language is used\r\neach time, and for a purpose full of significance. What is the language\r\nin regard to the prohibition of the African slave-trade? It runs in about\r\nthis way:\r\n\r\n\"The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now\r\nexisting shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the\r\nCongress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight.\"\r\n\r\nThe next allusion in the Constitution to the question of slavery and the\r\nblack race is on the subject of the basis of representation, and there the\r\nlanguage used is:\r\n\r\n\"Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several\r\nStates which may be included within this Union, according to their\r\nrespective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole\r\nnumber of free persons, including those bound to service for a term\r\nof years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other\r\npersons.\"\r\n\r\nIt says \"persons,\" not slaves, not negroes; but this \"three-fifths\" can be\r\napplied to no other class among us than the negroes.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the provision for the reclamation of fugitive slaves, it is\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof,\r\nescaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation\r\ntherein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered\r\nup, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\nThere again there is no mention of the word \"negro\" or of slavery. In\r\nall three of these places, being the only allusions to slavery in the\r\ninstrument, covert language is used. Language is used not suggesting that\r\nslavery existed or that the black race were among us. And I understand the\r\ncontemporaneous history of those times to be that covert language was used\r\nwith a purpose, and that purpose was that in our Constitution, which it\r\nwas hoped and is still hoped will endure forever,--when it should be read\r\nby intelligent and patriotic men, after the institution of slavery had\r\npassed from among us,--there should be nothing on the face of the great\r\ncharter of liberty suggesting that such a thing as negro slavery had ever\r\nexisted among us. This is part of the evidence that the fathers of the\r\ngovernment expected and intended the institution of slavery to come to\r\nan end. They expected and intended that it should be in the course of\r\nultimate extinction. And when I say that I desire to see the further\r\nspread of it arrested, I only say I desire to see that done which the\r\nfathers have first done. When I say I desire to see it placed where the\r\npublic mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction, I only say I desire to see it placed where they placed it.\r\nIt is not true that our fathers, as Judge Douglas assumes, made this\r\ngovernment part slave and part free. Understand the sense in which he\r\nputs it. He assumes that slavery is a rightful thing within itself,--was\r\nintroduced by the framers of the Constitution. The exact truth is, that\r\nthey found the institution existing among us, and they left it as they\r\nfound it. But in making the government they left this institution with\r\nmany clear marks of disapprobation upon it. They found slavery among\r\nthem, and they left it among them because of the difficulty--the absolute\r\nimpossibility--of its immediate removal. And when Judge Douglas asks me\r\nwhy we cannot let it remain part slave and part free, as the fathers of\r\nthe government made it, he asks a question based upon an assumption which\r\nis itself a falsehood; and I turn upon him and ask him the question, when\r\nthe policy that the fathers of the government had adopted in relation\r\nto this element among us was the best policy in the world, the only wise\r\npolicy, the only policy that we can ever safely continue upon that will\r\never give us peace, unless this dangerous element masters us all and\r\nbecomes a national institution,--I turn upon him and ask him why he could\r\nnot leave it alone. I turn and ask him why he was driven to the necessity\r\nof introducing a new policy in regard to it. He has himself said he\r\nintroduced a new policy. He said so in his speech on the 22d of March of\r\nthe present year, 1858. I ask him why he could not let it remain where\r\nour fathers placed it. I ask, too, of Judge Douglas and his friends why we\r\nshall not again place this institution upon the basis on which the fathers\r\nleft it. I ask you, when he infers that I am in favor of setting the free\r\nand slave States at war, when the institution was placed in that attitude\r\nby those who made the Constitution, did they make any war? If we had no\r\nwar out of it when thus placed, wherein is the ground of belief that we\r\nshall have war out of it if we return to that policy? Have we had any\r\npeace upon this matter springing from any other basis? I maintain that we\r\nhave not. I have proposed nothing more than a return to the policy of the\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\nI confess, when I propose a certain measure of policy, it is not enough\r\nfor me that I do not intend anything evil in the result, but it is\r\nincumbent on me to show that it has not a tendency to that result. I\r\nhave met Judge Douglas in that point of view. I have not only made the\r\ndeclaration that I do not mean to produce a conflict between the States,\r\nbut I have tried to show by fair reasoning, and I think I have shown to\r\nthe minds of fair men, that I propose nothing but what has a most peaceful\r\ntendency. The quotation that I happened to make in that Springfield\r\nSpeech, that \"a house divided against itself cannot stand,\" and which has\r\nproved so offensive to the judge, was part and parcel of the same thing.\r\nHe tries to show that variety in the democratic institutions of the\r\ndifferent States is necessary and indispensable. I do not dispute it. I\r\nhave no controversy with Judge Douglas about that. I shall very readily\r\nagree with him that it would be foolish for us to insist upon having a\r\ncranberry law here in Illinois, where we have no cranberries, because they\r\nhave a cranberry law in Indiana, where they have cranberries. I should\r\ninsist that it would be exceedingly wrong in us to deny to Virginia the\r\nright to enact oyster laws, where they have oysters, because we want no\r\nsuch laws here. I understand, I hope, quite as well as Judge Douglas or\r\nanybody else, that the variety in the soil and climate and face of the\r\ncountry, and consequent variety in the industrial pursuits and productions\r\nof a country, require systems of law conforming to this variety in the\r\nnatural features of the country. I understand quite as well as Judge\r\nDouglas that if we here raise a barrel of flour more than we want, and the\r\nLouisianians raise a barrel of sugar more than they want, it is of mutual\r\nadvantage to exchange. That produces commerce, brings us together, and\r\nmakes us better friends. We like one another the more for it. And I\r\nunderstand as well as Judge Douglas, or anybody else, that these mutual\r\naccommodations are the cements which bind together the different parts\r\nof this Union; that instead of being a thing to \"divide the\r\nhouse,\"--figuratively expressing the Union,--they tend to sustain it; they\r\nare the props of the house, tending always to hold it up.\r\n\r\nBut when I have admitted all this, I ask if there is any parallel between\r\nthese things and this institution of slavery? I do not see that there\r\nis any parallel at all between them. Consider it. When have we had any\r\ndifficulty or quarrel amongst ourselves about the cranberry laws of\r\nIndiana, or the oyster laws of Virginia, or the pine-lumber laws of Maine,\r\nor the fact that Louisiana produces sugar, and Illinois flour? When have\r\nwe had any quarrels over these things? When have we had perfect peace in\r\nregard to this thing which I say is an element of discord in this Union?\r\nWe have sometimes had peace, but when was it? It was when the institution\r\nof slavery remained quiet where it was. We have had difficulty and turmoil\r\nwhenever it has made a struggle to spread itself where it was not. I ask,\r\nthen, if experience does not speak in thunder-tones telling us that the\r\npolicy which has given peace to the country heretofore, being returned to,\r\ngives the greatest promise of peace again. You may say, and Judge Douglas\r\nhas intimated the same thing, that all this difficulty in regard to\r\nthe institution of slavery is the mere agitation of office-seekers and\r\nambitious Northern politicians. He thinks we want to get \"his place,\" I\r\nsuppose. I agree that there are office-seekers amongst us. The Bible\r\nsays somewhere that we are desperately selfish. I think we would have\r\ndiscovered that fact without the Bible. I do not claim that I am any less\r\nso than the average of men, but I do claim that I am not more selfish than\r\nJudge Douglas.\r\n\r\nBut is it true that all the difficulty and agitation we have in regard\r\nto this institution of slavery spring from office-seeking, from the mere\r\nambition of politicians? Is that the truth? How many times have we had\r\ndanger from this question? Go back to the day of the Missouri Compromise.\r\nGo back to the nullification question, at the bottom of which lay this\r\nsame slavery question. Go back to the time of the annexation of Texas.\r\nGo back to the troubles that led to the Compromise of 1850. You will find\r\nthat every time, with the single exception of the Nullification question,\r\nthey sprung from an endeavor to spread this institution. There never was a\r\nparty in the history of this country, and there probably never will be, of\r\nsufficient strength to disturb the general peace of the country. Parties\r\nthemselves may be divided and quarrel on minor questions, yet it extends\r\nnot beyond the parties themselves. But does not this question make a\r\ndisturbance outside of political circles? Does it not enter into the\r\nchurches and rend them asunder? What divided the great Methodist Church\r\ninto two parts, North and South? What has raised this constant disturbance\r\nin every Presbyterian General Assembly that meets? What disturbed the\r\nUnitarian Church in this very city two years ago? What has jarred and\r\nshaken the great American Tract Society recently, not yet splitting it,\r\nbut sure to divide it in the end? Is it not this same mighty, deep-seated\r\npower that somehow operates on the minds of men, exciting and stirring\r\nthem up in every avenue of society,--in politics, in religion, in\r\nliterature, in morals, in all the manifold relations of life? Is this the\r\nwork of politicians? Is that irresistible power, which for fifty years has\r\nshaken the government and agitated the people, to be stifled and subdued\r\nby pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing, and we ought not to\r\ntalk about it? If you will get everybody else to stop talking about it,\r\nI assure you I will quit before they have half done so. But where is\r\nthe philosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can quiet that\r\ndisturbing element in our society which has disturbed us for more than\r\nhalf a century, which has been the only serious danger that has threatened\r\nour institutions,--I say, where is the philosophy or the statesmanship\r\nbased on the assumption that we are to quit talking about it, and that the\r\npublic mind is all at once to cease being agitated by it? Yet this is the\r\npolicy here in the North that Douglas is advocating, that we are to care\r\nnothing about it! I ask you if it is not a false philosophy. Is it not a\r\nfalse statesmanship that undertakes to build up a system of policy upon\r\nthe basis of caring nothing about the very thing that everybody does care\r\nthe most about--a thing which all experience has shown we care a very\r\ngreat deal about?\r\n\r\nThe Judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to the exclusive\r\nright which the States have to decide the whole thing for themselves. I\r\nagree with him very readily that the different States have that right.\r\nHe is but fighting a man of straw when he assumes that I am contending\r\nagainst the right of the States to do as they please about it. Our\r\ncontroversy with him is in regard to the new Territories. We agree that\r\nwhen the States come in as States they have the right and the power to do\r\nas they please. We have no power as citizens of the free-States, or in\r\nour Federal capacity as members of the Federal Union through the General\r\nGovernment, to disturb slavery in the States where it exists. We profess\r\nconstantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the power\r\nof the government to disturb it; yet we are driven constantly to defend\r\nourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights of the\r\nSates. What I insist upon is, that the new Territories shall be kept free\r\nfrom it while in the Territorial condition. Judge Douglas assumes that we\r\nhave no interest in them,--that we have no right whatever to interfere. I\r\nthink we have some interest. I think that as white men we have. Do we not\r\nwish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express\r\nmyself? Do we not feel an interest in getting to that outlet with such\r\ninstitutions as we would like to have prevail there? If you go to the\r\nTerritory opposed to slavery, and another man comes upon the same ground\r\nwith his slave, upon the assumption that the things are equal, it turns\r\nout that he has the equal right all his way, and you have no part of it\r\nyour way. If he goes in and makes it a slave Territory, and by consequence\r\na slave State, is it not time that those who desire to have it a free\r\nState were on equal ground? Let me suggest it in a different way. How many\r\nDemocrats are there about here [\"A thousand\"] who have left slave States\r\nand come into the free State of Illinois to get rid of the institution\r\nof slavery? [Another voice: \"A thousand and one.\"] I reckon there are a\r\nthousand and one. I will ask you, if the policy you are now advocating had\r\nprevailed when this country was in a Territorial condition, where would\r\nyou have gone to get rid of it? Where would you have found your free State\r\nor Territory to go to? And when hereafter, for any cause, the people in\r\nthis place shall desire to find new homes, if they wish to be rid of the\r\ninstitution, where will they find the place to go to?\r\n\r\nNow, irrespective of the moral aspect of this question as to whether there\r\nis a right or wrong in enslaving a negro, I am still in favor of our new\r\nTerritories being in such a condition that white men may find a home,--may\r\nfind some spot where they can better their condition; where they can\r\nsettle upon new soil and better their condition in life. I am in favor\r\nof this, not merely (I must say it here as I have elsewhere) for our own\r\npeople who are born amongst us, but as an outlet for free white people\r\neverywhere the world over--in which Hans, and Baptiste, and Patrick, and\r\nall other men from all the world, may find new homes and better their\r\nconditions in life.\r\n\r\nI have stated upon former occasions, and I may as well state again, what I\r\nunderstand to be the real issue in this controversy between Judge Douglas\r\nand myself. On the point of my wanting to make war between the free and\r\nthe slave States, there has been no issue between us. So, too, when he\r\nassumes that I am in favor of producing a perfect social and political\r\nequality between the white and black races. These are false issues,\r\nupon which Judge Douglas has tried to force the controversy. There is\r\nno foundation in truth for the charge that I maintain either of these\r\npropositions. The real issue in this controversy--the one pressing upon\r\nevery mind--is the sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the\r\ninstitution of slavery as a wrong, and of another class that does not look\r\nupon it as a wrong. The sentiment that contemplates the institution of\r\nslavery in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the Republican\r\nparty. It is the sentiment around which all their actions, all their\r\narguments, circle, from which all their propositions radiate. They look\r\nupon it as being a moral, social, and political wrong; and while they\r\ncontemplate it as such, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual\r\nexistence among us, and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any\r\nsatisfactory way, and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about\r\nit. Yet, having a due regard for these, they desire a policy in regard\r\nto it that looks to its not creating any more danger. They insist that it\r\nshould, as far as may be, be treated as a wrong; and one of the methods of\r\ntreating it as a wrong is to make provision that it shall grow no larger.\r\nThey also desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery at some\r\ntime. These are the views they entertain in regard to it as I understand\r\nthem; and all their sentiments, all their arguments and propositions,\r\nare brought within this range. I have said, and I repeat it here, that\r\nif there be a man amongst us who does not think that the institution of\r\nslavery is wrong in any one of the aspects of which I have spoken, he is\r\nmisplaced, and ought not to be with us. And if there be a man amongst us\r\nwho is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its actual\r\npresence among us and the difficulty of getting rid of it suddenly in a\r\nsatisfactory way, and to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown\r\nabout it, that man is misplaced if he is on our platform. We disclaim\r\nsympathy with him in practical action. He is not placed properly with us.\r\n\r\nOn this subject of treating it as a wrong, and limiting its spread, let me\r\nsay a word. Has anything ever threatened the existence of this Union save\r\nand except this very institution of slavery? What is it that we hold most\r\ndear amongst us? Our own liberty and prosperity. What has ever threatened\r\nour liberty and prosperity, save and except this institution of slavery?\r\nIf this is true, how do you propose to improve the condition of things by\r\nenlarging slavery, by spreading it out and making it bigger? You may have\r\na wen or cancer upon your person, and not be able to cut it out, lest\r\nyou bleed to death; but surely it is no way to cure it, to engraft it and\r\nspread it over your whole body. That is no proper way of treating what you\r\nregard a wrong. You see this peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrong,\r\nrestricting the spread of it, and not allowing it to go into new\r\ncountries where it has not already existed. That is the peaceful way,\r\nthe old-fashioned way, the way in which the fathers themselves set us the\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have said there is a sentiment which treats it as not\r\nbeing wrong. That is the Democratic sentiment of this day. I do not mean\r\nto say that every man who stands within that range positively asserts that\r\nit is right. That class will include all who positively assert that it is\r\nright, and all who, like Judge Douglas, treat it as indifferent and do not\r\nsay it is either right or wrong. These two classes of men fall within the\r\ngeneral class of those who do not look upon it as a wrong. And if there\r\nbe among you anybody who supposes that he, as a Democrat, can consider\r\nhimself \"as much opposed to slavery as anybody,\" I would like to reason\r\nwith him. You never treat it as a wrong. What other thing that you\r\nconsider as a wrong do you deal with as you deal with that? Perhaps you\r\nsay it is wrong--but your leader never does, and you quarrel with anybody\r\nwho says it is wrong. Although you pretend to say so yourself, you can\r\nfind no fit place to deal with it as a wrong. You must not say anything\r\nabout it in the free States, because it is not here. You must not say\r\nanything about it in the slave States, because it is there. You must not\r\nsay anything about it in the pulpit, because that is religion, and has\r\nnothing to do with it. You must not say anything about it in politics,\r\nbecause that will disturb the security of \"my place.\" There is no place to\r\ntalk about it as being a wrong, although you say yourself it is a wrong.\r\nBut, finally, you will screw yourself up to the belief that if the people\r\nof the slave States should adopt a system of gradual emancipation on the\r\nslavery question, you would be in favor of it. You would be in favor of\r\nit. You say that is getting it in the right place, and you would be glad\r\nto see it succeed. But you are deceiving yourself. You all know that Frank\r\nBlair and Gratz Brown, down there in St. Louis, undertook to introduce\r\nthat system in Missouri. They fought as valiantly as they could for the\r\nsystem of gradual emancipation which you pretend you would be glad to see\r\nsucceed. Now, I will bring you to the test. After a hard fight they were\r\nbeaten, and when the news came over here, you threw up your hats and\r\nhurrahed for Democracy. More than that, take all the argument made in\r\nfavor of the system you have proposed, and it carefully excludes the idea\r\nthat there is anything wrong in the institution of slavery. The arguments\r\nto sustain that policy carefully exclude it. Even here to-day you heard\r\nJudge Douglas quarrel with me because I uttered a wish that it might\r\nsometime come to an end. Although Henry Clay could say he wished every\r\nslave in the United States was in the country of his ancestors, I am\r\ndenounced by those pretending to respect Henry Clay for uttering a\r\nwish that it might sometime, in some peaceful way, come to an end. The\r\nDemocratic policy in regard to that institution will not tolerate the\r\nmerest breath, the slightest hint, of the least degree of wrong about\r\nit. Try it by some of Judge Douglas's arguments. He says he \"don't care\r\nwhether it is voted up or voted down\" in the Territories. I do not care\r\nmyself, in dealing with that expression, whether it is intended to be\r\nexpressive of his individual sentiments on the subject, or only of the\r\nnational policy he desires to have established. It is alike valuable\r\nfor my purpose. Any man can say that who does not see anything wrong\r\nin slavery; but no man can logically say it who does see a wrong in it,\r\nbecause no man can logically say he don't care whether a wrong is voted\r\nup or voted down. He may say he don't care whether an indifferent thing\r\nis voted up or down, but he must logically have a choice between a right\r\nthing and a wrong thing. He contends that whatever community wants slaves\r\nhas a right to have them. So they have, if it is not a wrong. But if it is\r\na wrong, he cannot say people have a right to do wrong. He says that upon\r\nthe score of equality slaves should be allowed to go in a new Territory,\r\nlike other property. This is strictly logical if there is no difference\r\nbetween it and other property. If it and other property are equal, this\r\nargument is entirely logical. But if you insist that one is wrong and the\r\nother right, there is no use to institute a comparison between right\r\nand wrong. You may turn over everything in the Democratic policy from\r\nbeginning to end, whether in the shape it takes on the statute book, in\r\nthe shape it takes in the Dred Scott decision, in the shape it takes in\r\nconversation, or the shape it takes in short maxim-like arguments,--it\r\neverywhere carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it.\r\n\r\nThat is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue in this\r\ncountry when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be\r\nsilent. It is the eternal struggle between these two principles--right and\r\nwrong--throughout the world. They are the two principles that have\r\nstood face to face from the beginning of time, and will ever continue\r\nto struggle. The one is the common right of humanity, and the other the\r\ndivine right of kings. It is the same principle in whatever shape it\r\ndevelops itself. It is the same spirit that says, \"You work and toil and\r\nearn bread, and I'll eat it.\" No matter in what shape it comes, whether\r\nfrom the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own\r\nnation and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an\r\napology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle.\r\nI was glad to express my gratitude at Quincy, and I re-express it here,\r\nto Judge Douglas,--that he looks to no end of the institution of slavery.\r\nThat will help the people to see where the struggle really is. It will\r\nhereafter place with us all men who really do wish the wrong may have\r\nan end. And whenever we can get rid of the fog which obscures the real\r\nquestion, when we can get Judge Douglas and his friends to avow a policy\r\nlooking to its perpetuation,--we can get out from among that class of men\r\nand bring them to the side of those who treat it as a wrong. Then there\r\nwill soon be an end of it, and that end will be its \"ultimate extinction.\"\r\nWhenever the issue can be distinctly made, and all extraneous matter\r\nthrown out so that men can fairly see the real difference between the\r\nparties, this controversy will soon be settled, and it will be done\r\npeaceably too. There will be no war, no violence. It will be placed again\r\nwhere the wisest and best men of the world placed it. Brooks of South\r\nCarolina once declared that when this Constitution was framed its framers\r\ndid not look to the institution existing until this day. When he said\r\nthis, I think he stated a fact that is fully borne out by the history of\r\nthe times. But he also said they were better and wiser men than the men of\r\nthese days, yet the men of these days had experience which they had not,\r\nand by the invention of the cotton-gin it became a necessity in this\r\ncountry that slavery should be perpetual. I now say that, willingly or\r\nunwillingly--purposely or without purpose, Judge Douglas has been the\r\nmost prominent instrument in changing the position of the institution of\r\nslavery,--which the fathers of the government expected to come to an end\r\nere this, and putting it upon Brooks's cotton-gin basis; placing it where\r\nhe openly confesses he has no desire there shall ever be an end of it.\r\n\r\nI understand I have ten minutes yet. I will employ it in saying something\r\nabout this argument Judge Douglas uses, while he sustains the Dred Scott\r\ndecision, that the people of the Territories can still somehow exclude\r\nslavery. The first thing I ask attention to is the fact that Judge Douglas\r\nconstantly said, before the decision, that whether they could or not,\r\nwas a question for the Supreme Court. But after the court had made the\r\ndecision he virtually says it is not a question for the Supreme Court, but\r\nfor the people. And how is it he tells us they can exclude it? He says it\r\nneeds \"police regulations,\" and that admits of \"unfriendly legislation.\"\r\nAlthough it is a right established by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates to take a slave into a Territory of the United States and hold him\r\nas property, yet unless the Territorial Legislature will give friendly\r\nlegislation, and more especially if they adopt unfriendly legislation,\r\nthey can practically exclude him. Now, without meeting this proposition as\r\na matter of fact, I pass to consider the real constitutional obligation.\r\nLet me take the gentleman who looks me in the face before me, and let\r\nus suppose that he is a member of the Territorial Legislature. The first\r\nthing he will do will be to swear that he will support the Constitution\r\nof the United States. His neighbor by his side in the Territory has\r\nslaves and needs Territorial legislation to enable him to enjoy that\r\nconstitutional right. Can he withhold the legislation which his neighbor\r\nneeds for the enjoyment of a right which is fixed in his favor in the\r\nConstitution of the United States which he has sworn to support? Can he\r\nwithhold it without violating his oath? And, more especially, can he pass\r\nunfriendly legislation to violate his oath? Why, this is a monstrous sort\r\nof talk about the Constitution of the United States! There has never been\r\nas outlandish or lawless a doctrine from the mouth of any respectable man\r\non earth. I do not believe it is a constitutional right to hold slaves in\r\na Territory of the United States. I believe the decision was improperly\r\nmade and I go for reversing it. Judge Douglas is furious against those who\r\ngo for reversing a decision. But he is for legislating it out of all\r\nforce while the law itself stands. I repeat that there has never been so\r\nmonstrous a doctrine uttered from the mouth of a respectable man.\r\n\r\nI suppose most of us (I know it of myself) believe that the people of the\r\nSouthern States are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law,--that\r\nis a right fixed in the Constitution. But it cannot be made available to\r\nthem without Congressional legislation. In the Judge's language, it is a\r\n\"barren right,\" which needs legislation before it can become efficient\r\nand valuable to the persons to whom it is guaranteed. And as the right is\r\nconstitutional, I agree that the legislation shall be granted to it, and\r\nthat not that we like the institution of slavery. We profess to have no\r\ntaste for running and catching niggers, at least, I profess no taste for\r\nthat job at all. Why then do I yield support to a Fugitive Slave law?\r\nBecause I do not understand that the Constitution, which guarantees that\r\nright, can be supported without it. And if I believed that the right to\r\nhold a slave in a Territory was equally fixed in the Constitution with the\r\nright to reclaim fugitives, I should be bound to give it the legislation\r\nnecessary to support it. I say that no man can deny his obligation to give\r\nthe necessary legislation to support slavery in a Territory, who believes\r\nit is a constitutional right to have it there. No man can, who does not\r\ngive the Abolitionists an argument to deny the obligation enjoined by\r\nthe Constitution to enact a Fugitive State law. Try it now. It is the\r\nstrongest Abolition argument ever made. I say if that Dred Scott decision\r\nis correct, then the right to hold slaves in a Territory is equally a\r\nconstitutional right with the right of a slaveholder to have his runaway\r\nreturned. No one can show the distinction between them. The one is\r\nexpress, so that we cannot deny it. The other is construed to be in the\r\nConstitution, so that he who believes the decision to be correct believes\r\nin the right. And the man who argues that by unfriendly legislation,\r\nin spite of that constitutional right, slavery may be driven from the\r\nTerritories, cannot avoid furnishing an argument by which Abolitionists\r\nmay deny the obligation to return fugitives, and claim the power to pass\r\nlaws unfriendly to the right of the slaveholder to reclaim his fugitive. I\r\ndo not know how such an arguement may strike a popular assembly like this,\r\nbut I defy anybody to go before a body of men whose minds are educated\r\nto estimating evidence and reasoning, and show that there is an iota of\r\ndifference between the constitutional right to reclaim a fugitive and the\r\nconstitutional right to hold a slave, in a Territory, provided this Dred\r\nScott decision is correct, I defy any man to make an argument that will\r\njustify unfriendly legislation to deprive a slaveholder of his right to\r\nhold his slave in a Territory, that will not equally, in all its length,\r\nbreadth, and thickness, furnish an argument for nullifying the Fugitive\r\nSlave law. Why, there is not such an Abolitionist in the nation as\r\nDouglas, after all! such an Abolitionist in the nation as Douglas, after\r\nall!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAPERS AND WRITINGS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\nVOLUME FIVE\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL EDITION\r\n\r\nBy Abraham Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited by Arthur Brooks Lapsley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, Volume Five, 1858-1862\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SYDNEY SPRING, GRAYVILLE, ILL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 19, 1858.\r\n\r\nSYDNEY SPRING, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter introducing Mr. Faree was duly received. There\r\nwas no opening to nominate him for Superintendent of Public Instruction,\r\nbut through him Egypt made a most valuable contribution to the convention.\r\nI think it may be fairly said that he came off the lion of the day--or\r\nrather of the night. Can you not elect him to the Legislature? It seems to\r\nme he would be hard to beat. What objection could be made to him? What is\r\nyour Senator Martin saying and doing? What is Webb about?\r\n\r\nPlease write me. Yours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 24, 1858\r\n\r\nH. C. WHITNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your letter enclosing the attack of the Times upon me was\r\nreceived this morning. Give yourself no concern about my voting against\r\nthe supplies. Unless you are without faith that a lie can be successfully\r\ncontradicted, there is not a word of truth in the charge, and I am just\r\nconsidering a little as to the best shape to put a contradiction in. Show\r\nthis to whomever you please, but do not publish it in the paper.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. W. SOMERS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 25, 1858.\r\n\r\nJAMES W. SOMERS, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 22nd, inclosing a draft of two hundred dollars,\r\nwas duly received. I have paid it on the judgment, and herewith you\r\nhave the receipt. I do not wish to say anything as to who shall be the\r\nRepublican candidate for the Legislature in your district, further than\r\nthat I have full confidence in Dr. Hull. Have you ever got in the way of\r\nconsulting with McKinley in political matters? He is true as steel, and\r\nhis judgment is very good. The last I heard from him, he rather thought\r\nWeldon, of De Witt, was our best timber for representative, all things\r\nconsidered. But you there must settle it among yourselves. It may well\r\npuzzle older heads than yours to understand how, as the Dred Scott\r\ndecision holds, Congress can authorize a Territorial Legislature to do\r\neverything else, and cannot authorize them to prohibit slavery. That is\r\none of the things the court can decide, but can never give an intelligible\r\nreason for.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 28, 1858.\r\n\r\nA. CAMPBELL, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--In 1856 you gave me authority to draw on you for any sum not\r\nexceeding five hundred dollars. I see clearly that such a privilege would\r\nbe more available now than it was then. I am aware that times are tighter\r\nnow than they were then. Please write me at all events, and whether you\r\ncan now do anything or not I shall continue grateful for the past.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, July 16, 1858.\r\n\r\nHON. JOSEPH GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I write this to say that from the specimens of Douglas\r\nDemocracy we occasionally see here from Madison, we learn that they are\r\nmaking very confident calculation of beating you and your friends for the\r\nlower house, in that county. They offer to bet upon it. Billings and Job,\r\nrespectively, have been up here, and were each as I learn, talking largely\r\nabout it. If they do so, it can only be done by carrying the Fillmore men\r\nof 1856 very differently from what they seem to [be] going in the other\r\nparty. Below is the vote of 1856, in your district:\r\n\r\nCounties.\r\n\r\n     Counties.  Buchanan.   Fremont.   Fillmore.\r\n   Bond............ 607      153      659\r\n   Madison......... 1451     1111     1658\r\n   Montgomery...... 992      162      686\r\n                     ----     ----     ----\r\n                     3050     1426     3003\r\n\r\nBy this you will see, if you go through the calculation, that if they get\r\none quarter of the Fillmore votes, and you three quarters, they will beat\r\nyou 125 votes. If they get one fifth, and you four fifths, you beat them\r\n179. In Madison, alone, if our friends get 1000 of the Fillmore votes, and\r\ntheir opponents the remainder, 658, we win by just two votes.\r\n\r\nThis shows the whole field, on the basis of the election of 1856.\r\n\r\nWhether, since then, any Buchanan, or Fremonters, have shifted ground, and\r\nhow the majority of new votes will go, you can judge better than I.\r\n\r\nOf course you, on the ground, can better determine your line of tactics\r\nthan any one off the ground; but it behooves you to be wide awake and\r\nactively working.\r\n\r\nDon't neglect it; and write me at your first leisure. Yours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN MATHERS, JACKSONVILLE, ILL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, JULY 20, 1858.\r\n\r\nJNO. MATHERS, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your kind and interesting letter of the 19th was duly\r\nreceived. Your suggestions as to placing one's self on the offensive\r\nrather than the defensive are certainly correct. That is a point which I\r\nshall not disregard. I spoke here on Saturday night. The speech, not very\r\nwell reported, appears in the State journal of this morning. You doubtless\r\nwill see it; and I hope that you will perceive in it that I am already\r\nimproving. I would mail you a copy now, but have not one [at] hand. I\r\nthank you for your letter and shall be pleased to hear from you again.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, JULY 25, 1858.\r\n\r\nHON. J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your doleful letter of the 8th was received on my return\r\nfrom Chicago last night. I do hope you are worse scared than hurt, though\r\nyou ought to know best. We must not lose the district. We must make a job\r\nof it, and save it. Lay hold of the proper agencies, and secure all the\r\nAmericans you can, at once. I do hope, on closer inspection, you will find\r\nthey are not half gone. Make a little test. Run down one of the poll-books\r\nof the Edwardsville precinct, and take the first hundred known American\r\nnames. Then quietly ascertain how many of them are actually going for\r\nDouglas. I think you will find less than fifty. But even if you find\r\nfifty, make sure of the other fifty, that is, make sure of all you can, at\r\nall events. We will set other agencies to work which shall compensate for\r\nthe loss of a good many Americans. Don't fail to check the stampede at\r\nonce. Trumbull, I think, will be with you before long.\r\n\r\nThere is much he cannot do, and some he can. I have reason to hope there\r\nwill be other help of an appropriate kind. Write me again.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO B. C. COOK.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. 2, 1858.\r\n\r\nHon. B. C. COOK.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have a letter from a very true and intelligent man\r\ninsisting that there is a plan on foot in La Salle and Bureau to run\r\nDouglas Republicans for Congress and for the Legislature in those\r\ncounties, if they can only get the encouragement of our folks nominating\r\npretty extreme abolitionists.\r\n\r\nIt is thought they will do nothing if our folks nominate men who are not\r\nvery obnoxious to the charge of abolitionism. Please have your eye upon\r\nthis. Signs are looking pretty fair.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HON. J. M.

PALMER.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Since we parted last evening no new thought has occurred to\r\n[me] on the subject of which we talked most yesterday.\r\n\r\nI have concluded, however, to speak at your town on Tuesday, August 31st,\r\nand have promised to have it so appear in the papers of to-morrow. Judge\r\nTrumbull has not yet reached here.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

If life and health continue I shall\r\npretty likely be at Augusta on the 25th.\r\n\r\nThings look reasonably well. Will tell you more fully when I see you.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

CUNNINGHAM, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 18th, signed as secretary of the Republican\r\nclub, is received. In the matter of making speeches I am a good deal\r\npressed by invitations from almost all quarters, and while I hope to be\r\nat Urbana some time during the canvass, I cannot yet say when. Can you not\r\nsee me at Monticello on the 6th of September?\r\n\r\nDouglas and I, for the first time this canvass, crossed swords here\r\nyesterday; the fire flew some, and I am glad to know I am yet alive. There\r\nwas a vast concourse of people--more than could get near enough to hear.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON SLAVERY IN A DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nAugust??, 1858\r\n\r\nAs I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses\r\nmy idea of democracy.

It is thought they will do nothing if our folks\r\nnominate men who are not very [undecipherable word looks like \"obnoxious\"]\r\nto the charge of abolitionism. Please have your eye upon this.

You will see\r\nby the Journal that I have been appointed to speak at Danville on the 22d\r\nof Sept.,--the day after Douglas speaks there. My recent experience\r\nshows that speaking at the same place the next day after D. is the very\r\nthing,--it is, in fact, a concluding speech on him. Please show this\r\nto Messrs. Harmon and Beckwith; and tell them they must excuse me from\r\nwriting separate letters to them.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nP. S.--Give full notice to all surrounding country. A.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT PARIS, ILL.,\r\n\r\nSEPT. 8, 1858.\r\n\r\nLet us inquire what Judge Douglas really invented when he introduced the\r\nNebraska Bill? He called it Popular Sovereignty. What does that mean?\r\nIt means the sovereignty of the people over their own affairs--in other\r\nwords, the right of the people to govern themselves. Did Judge Douglas\r\ninvent this? Not quite. The idea of popular sovereignty was floating about\r\nseveral ages before the author of the Nebraska Bill was born--indeed,\r\nbefore Columbus set foot on this continent. In the year 1776 it took form\r\nin the noble words which you are all familiar with: \"We hold these truths\r\nto be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\" etc. Was not this the\r\norigin of popular sovereignty as applied to the American people? Here we\r\nare told that governments are instituted among men deriving their\r\njust powers from the consent of the governed. If that is not popular\r\nsovereignty, then I have no conception of the meaning of words. If Judge\r\nDouglas did not invent this kind of popular sovereignty, let us pursue\r\nthe inquiry and find out what kind he did invent. Was it the right of\r\nemigrants to Kansas and Nebraska to govern themselves, and a lot of\r\n\"niggers,\" too, if they wanted them? Clearly this was no invention of his\r\nbecause General Cass put forth the same doctrine in 1848 in his so called\r\nNicholson letter, six years before Douglas thought of such a thing. Then\r\nwhat was it that the \"Little Giant\" invented? It never occurred to General\r\nCass to call his discovery by the odd name of popular sovereignty. He had\r\nnot the face to say that the right of the people to govern \"niggers\" was\r\nthe right of the people to govern themselves. His notions of the fitness\r\nof things were not moulded to the brazenness of calling the right to put\r\na hundred \"niggers\" through under the lash in Nebraska a \"sacred\" right of\r\nself-government. And here I submit to you was Judge Douglas's discovery,\r\nand the whole of it: He discovered that the right to breed and flog\r\nnegroes in Nebraska was popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT CLINTON, ILLINOIS,\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 8, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe questions are sometimes asked \"What is all this fuss that is being\r\nmade about negroes? What does it amount to? And where will it end?\" These\r\nquestions imply that those who ask them consider the slavery question a\r\nvery insignificant matter they think that it amounts to little or nothing\r\nand that those who agitate it are extremely foolish. Now it must be\r\nadmitted that if the great question which has caused so much trouble is\r\ninsignificant, we are very foolish to have anything to do with it--if it\r\nis of no importance we had better throw it aside and busy ourselves\r\nwith something else. But let us inquire a little into this insignificant\r\nmatter, as it is called by some, and see if it is not important enough to\r\ndemand the close attention of every well-wisher of the Union. In one of\r\nDouglas's recent speeches, I find a reference to one which was made by\r\nme in Springfield some time ago. The judge makes one quotation from that\r\nspeech that requires some little notice from me at this time. I regret\r\nthat I have not my Springfield speech before me, but the judge has quoted\r\none particular part of it so often that I think I can recollect it. It\r\nruns I think as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with\r\nthe avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery\r\nagitation. Under the operation of that policy that agitation has not only\r\nnot ceased but has constantly augmented. In my opinion it will not cease\r\nuntil a crisis shall have been reached and passed.\r\n\r\n\"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government\r\ncannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the\r\nUnion to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall, but I do expect\r\nit will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the\r\nother. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of\r\nit and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it\r\nis in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it\r\nforward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well\r\nas new, North as well as South.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas makes use of the above quotation, and finds a great deal of\r\nfault with it. He deals unfairly with me, and tries to make the people of\r\nthis State believe that I advocated dangerous doctrines in my Springfield\r\nspeech. Let us see if that portion of my Springfield speech of which Judge\r\nDouglas complains so bitterly, is as objectionable to others as it is\r\nto him. We are, certainly, far into the fifth year since a policy was\r\ninitiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end\r\nto slavery agitation. On the fourth day of January, 1854, Judge Douglas\r\nintroduced the Kansas-Nebraska bill. He initiated a new policy, and that\r\npolicy, so he says, was to put an end to the agitation of the slavery\r\nquestion. Whether that was his object or not I will not stop to discuss,\r\nbut at all events some kind of a policy was initiated; and what has been\r\nthe result? Instead of the quiet and good feeling which were promised us\r\nby the self-styled author of Popular Sovereignty, we have had nothing but\r\nill-feeling and agitation. According to Judge Douglas, the passage of the\r\nNebraska bill would tranquilize the whole country--there would be no more\r\nslavery agitation in or out of Congress, and the vexed question would be\r\nleft entirely to the people of the Territories. Such was the opinion\r\nof Judge Douglas, and such were the opinions of the leading men of the\r\nDemocratic Party. Even as late as the spring of 1856 Mr. Buchanan said, a\r\nshort time subsequent to his nomination by the Cincinnati convention, that\r\nthe territory of Kansas would be tranquil in less than six weeks. Perhaps\r\nhe thought so, but Kansas has not been and is not tranquil, and it may be\r\na long time before she may be so.\r\n\r\nWe all know how fierce the agitation was in Congress last winter, and\r\nwhat a narrow escape Kansas had from being admitted into the Union with a\r\nconstitution that was detested by ninety-nine hundredths of her citizens.\r\nDid the angry debates which took place at Washington during the last\r\nseason of Congress lead you to suppose that the slavery agitation was\r\nsettled?\r\n\r\nAn election was held in Kansas in the month of August, and the\r\nconstitution which was submitted to the people was voted down by a large\r\nmajority. So Kansas is still out of the Union, and there is a probability\r\nthat she will remain out for some time. But Judge Douglas says the slavery\r\nquestion is settled. He says the bill he introduced into the Senate of\r\nthe United States on the 4th day of January, 1854, settled the slavery\r\nquestion forever! Perhaps he can tell us how that bill settled the slavery\r\nquestion, for if he is able to settle a question of such great magnitude\r\nhe ought to be able to explain the manner in which he does it. He knows\r\nand you know that the question is not settled, and that his ill-timed\r\nexperiment to settle it has made it worse than it ever was before.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me say a few words in regard to Douglas's great hobby of negro\r\nequality. He thinks--he says at least--that the Republican party is in\r\nfavor of allowing whites and blacks to intermarry, and that a man can't be\r\na good Republican unless he is willing to elevate black men to office\r\nand to associate with them on terms of perfect equality. He knows that\r\nwe advocate no such doctrines as these, but he cares not how much he\r\nmisrepresents us if he can gain a few votes by so doing. To show you what\r\nmy opinion of negro equality was in times past, and to prove to you that\r\nI stand on that question where I always stood, I will read you a few\r\nextracts from a speech that was made by me in Peoria in 1854. It was made\r\nin reply to one of Judge Douglas's speeches.\r\n\r\n(Mr. Lincoln then read a number of extracts which had the ring of the true\r\nmetal. We have rarely heard anything with which we have been more pleased.\r\nAnd the audience after hearing the extracts read, and comparing their\r\nconservative sentiments with those now advocated by Mr. Lincoln, testified\r\ntheir approval by loud applause. How any reasonable man can hear one\r\nof Mr. Lincoln's speeches without being converted to Republicanism is\r\nsomething that we can't account for. Ed.)\r\n\r\nSlavery, continued Mr. Lincoln, is not a matter of little importance,\r\nit overshadows every other question in which we are interested. It has\r\ndivided the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, and has sown discord in\r\nthe American Tract Society. The churches have split and the society will\r\nfollow their example before long. So it will be seen that slavery is\r\nagitated in the religious as well as in the political world. Judge Douglas\r\nis very much afraid in the triumph that the Republican party will lead\r\nto a general mixture of the white and black races. Perhaps I am wrong\r\nin saying that he is afraid, so I will correct myself by saying that\r\nhe pretends to fear that the success of our party will result in the\r\namalgamation of the blacks and whites. I think I can show plainly, from\r\ndocuments now before me, that Judge Douglas's fears are groundless. The\r\ncensus of 1800 tells us that in that year there were over four hundred\r\nthousand mulattoes in the United States. Now let us take what is called\r\nan Abolition State--the Republican, slavery-hating State of New\r\nHampshire--and see how many mulattoes we can find within her borders.\r\nThe number amounts to just one hundred and eighty-four. In the Old\r\nDominion--in the Democratic and aristocratic State of Virginia--there were\r\na few more mulattoes than the Census-takers found in New Hampshire. How\r\nmany do you suppose there were? Seventy-nine thousand, seven hundred and\r\nseventy-five--twenty-three thousand more than there were in all the\r\nfree States! In the slave States there were in 1800, three hundred and\r\nforty-eight thousand mulattoes all of home production; and in the free\r\nStates there were less than sixty thousand mulattoes--and a large number\r\nof them were imported from the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT EDWARDSVILLE, ILL.,\r\n\r\nSEPT. 13, 1858.\r\n\r\nI have been requested to give a concise statement of the difference, as\r\nI understand it, between the Democratic and Republican parties, on the\r\nleading issues of the campaign. This question has been put to me by a\r\ngentleman whom I do not know. I do not even know whether he is a friend of\r\nmine or a supporter of Judge Douglas in this contest, nor does that make\r\nany difference. His question is a proper one. Lest I should forget it, I\r\nwill give you my answer before proceeding with the line of argument I have\r\nmarked out for this discussion.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the Republican and the Democratic parties on the\r\nleading issues of this contest, as I understand it, is that the former\r\nconsider slavery a moral, social and political wrong, while the latter\r\ndo not consider it either a moral, a social or a political wrong; and the\r\naction of each, as respects the growth of the country and the expansion of\r\nour population, is squared to meet these views. I will not affirm that the\r\nDemocratic party consider slavery morally, socially and politically right,\r\nthough their tendency to that view has, in my opinion, been constant and\r\nunmistakable for the past five years. I prefer to take, as the accepted\r\nmaxim of the party, the idea put forth by Judge Douglas, that he \"don't\r\ncare whether slavery is voted down or voted up.\" I am quite willing to\r\nbelieve that many Democrats would prefer that slavery should be always\r\nvoted down, and I know that some prefer that it be always voted up; but\r\nI have a right to insist that their action, especially if it be their\r\nconstant action, shall determine their ideas and preferences on this\r\nsubject. Every measure of the Democratic party of late years, bearing\r\ndirectly or indirectly on the slavery question, has corresponded with this\r\nnotion of utter indifference whether slavery or freedom shall outrun in\r\nthe race of empire across to the Pacific--every measure, I say, up to the\r\nDred Scott decision, where, it seems to me, the idea is boldly suggested\r\nthat slavery is better than freedom. The Republican party, on the\r\ncontrary, hold that this government was instituted to secure the blessings\r\nof freedom, and that slavery is an unqualified evil to the negro, to the\r\nwhite man, to the soil, and to the State. Regarding it as an evil, they\r\nwill not molest it in the States where it exists, they will not overlook\r\nthe constitutional guards which our fathers placed around it; they will\r\ndo nothing that can give proper offence to those who hold slaves by legal\r\nsanction; but they will use every constitutional method to prevent the\r\nevil from becoming larger and involving more negroes, more white men,\r\nmore soil, and more States in its deplorable consequences. They will, if\r\npossible, place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it\r\nis in course of ultimate peaceable extinction in God's own good time. And\r\nto this end they will, if possible, restore the government to the policy\r\nof the fathers, the policy of preserving the new Territories from the\r\nbaneful influence of human bondage, as the Northwestern Territories were\r\nsought to be preserved by the Ordinance of 1787, and the Compromise Act\r\nof 1820. They will oppose, in all its length and breadth, the modern\r\nDemocratic idea, that slavery is as good as freedom, and ought to have\r\nroom for expansion all over the continent, if people can be found to carry\r\nit. All, or nearly all, of Judge Douglas's arguments are logical, if you\r\nadmit that slavery is as good and as right as freedom, and not one of them\r\nis worth a rush if you deny it. This is the difference, as I understand\r\nit, between the Republican and Democratic parties.\r\n\r\nMy friends, I have endeavored to show you the logical consequences of the\r\nDred Scott decision, which holds that the people of a Territory cannot\r\nprevent the establishment of slavery in their midst. I have stated what\r\ncannot be gainsaid, that the grounds upon which this decision is made are\r\nequally applicable to the free States as to the free Territories, and\r\nthat the peculiar reasons put forth by Judge Douglas for indorsing this\r\ndecision commit him, in advance, to the next decision and to all other\r\ndecisions corning from the same source. And when, by all these means, you\r\nhave succeeded in dehumanizing the negro; when you have put him down and\r\nmade it impossible for him to be but as the beasts of the field; when you\r\nhave extinguished his soul in this world and placed him where the ray of\r\nhope is blown out as in the darkness of the damned, are you quite\r\nsure that the demon you have roused will not turn and rend you? What\r\nconstitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence? It is not\r\nour frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, our army and our navy.\r\nThese are not our reliance against tyranny All of those may be turned\r\nagainst us without making us weaker for the struggle. Our reliance is in\r\nthe love of liberty which God has planted in us. Our defense is in the\r\nspirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands\r\neverywhere. Destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of\r\ndespotism at your own doors. Familiarize yourselves with the chains of\r\nbondage and you prepare your own limbs to wear them. Accustomed to trample\r\non the rights of others, you have lost the genius of your own independence\r\nand become the fit subjects of the first cunning tyrant who rises among\r\nyou. And let me tell you, that all these things are prepared for you by\r\nthe teachings of history, if the elections shall promise that the next\r\nDred Scott decision and all future decisions will be quietly acquiesced in\r\nby the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERSE TO \"LINNIE\"\r\n\r\nSeptember 30,? 1858.\r\n\r\nTO \"LINNIE\":\r\n\r\n     A sweet plaintive song did I hear\r\n     And I fancied that she was the singer.\r\n     May emotions as pure as that song set astir\r\n     Be the wont that the future shall bring her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGROES ARE MEN\r\n\r\nTO J. U. BROWN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, OCT 18, 1858\r\n\r\nHON. J. U. BROWN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I do not perceive how I can express myself more plainly\r\nthan I have in the fore-going extracts. In four of them I have expressly\r\ndisclaimed all intention to bring about social and political equality\r\nbetween the white and black races and in all the rest I have done the same\r\nthing by clear implication.\r\n\r\nI have made it equally plain that I think the negro is included in the\r\nword \"men\" used in the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nI believe the declaration that \"all men are created equal\" is the great\r\nfundamental principle upon which our free institutions rest; that\r\nnegro slavery is violative of that principle; but that, by our frame of\r\ngovernment, that principle has not been made one of legal obligation; that\r\nby our frame of government, States which have slavery are to retain it, or\r\nsurrender it at their own pleasure; and that all others--individuals, free\r\nStates and national Government--are constitutionally bound to leave them\r\nalone about it.\r\n\r\nI believe our Government was thus framed because of the necessity\r\nspringing from the actual presence of slavery, when it was framed.\r\n\r\nThat such necessity does not exist in the Territories when slavery is not\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn his Mendenhall speech Mr. Clay says: \"Now as an abstract principle\r\nthere is no doubt of the truth of that declaration (all men created\r\nequal), and it is desirable, in the original construction of society, to\r\nkeep it in view as a great fundamental principle.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in the same speech Mr. Clay says: \"If a state of nature existed\r\nand we were about to lay the foundations of society, no man would be more\r\nstrongly opposed than I should to incorporate the institution of slavery\r\namong its elements.\"\r\n\r\nExactly so. In our new free Territories, a state of nature does exist.\r\nIn them Congress lays the foundations of society; and in laying those\r\nfoundations, I say, with Mr. Clay, it is desirable that the declaration\r\nof the equality of all men shall be kept in view as a great fundamental\r\nprinciple, and that Congress, which lays the foundations of society,\r\nshould, like Mr. Clay, be strongly opposed to the incorporation of slavery\r\nand its elements.\r\n\r\nBut it does not follow that social and political equality between whites\r\nand blacks must be incorporated because slavery must not. The declaration\r\ndoes not so require.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n[Newspaper cuttings of Lincoln's speeches at Peoria, in 1854, at\r\nSpringfield, Ottawa, Chicago, and Charleston, in 1858.

SYMPSON, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Since parting with you this morning I heard some things which\r\nmake me believe that Edmunds and Morrill will spend this week among the\r\nNational Democrats, trying to induce them to content themselves by voting\r\nfor Jake Davis, and then to vote for the Douglas candidates for senator\r\nand representative. Have this headed off, if you can. Call Wagley's\r\nattention to it and have him and the National Democrat for Rep. to\r\ncounteract it as far as they can.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

JUDD\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 15th is just received. I wrote you the same day.\r\nAs to the pecuniary matter, I am willing to pay according to my ability;\r\nbut I am the poorest hand living to get others to pay. I have been on\r\nexpenses so long without earning anything that I am absolutely without\r\nmoney now for even household purposes. Still, if you can put in two\r\nhundred and fifty dollars for me toward discharging the debt of the\r\ncommittee, I will allow it when you and I settle the private matter\r\nbetween us. This, with what I have already paid, and with an outstanding\r\nnote of mine, will exceed my subscription of five hundred dollars. This,\r\ntoo, is exclusive of my ordinary expenses during the campaign, all of\r\nwhich, being added to my loss of time and business, bears pretty heavily\r\nupon one no better off in [this] world's goods than I; but as I had\r\nthe post of honor, it is not for me to be over nice. You are feeling\r\nbadly,--\"And this too shall pass away,\" never fear.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT MUST GO ON\r\n\r\nTO H. ASBURY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, November 19, 1858.\r\n\r\nHENRY ASBURY, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 13th was received some days ago. The fight must go\r\non. The cause of civil liberty must not be surrendered at the end of one\r\nor even one hundred defeats. Douglas had the ingenuity to be supported in\r\nthe late contest both as the best means to break down and to uphold the\r\nslave interest. No ingenuity can keep these antagonistic elements in\r\nharmony long. Another explosion will soon come.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREALIZATION THAT DEBATES MUST BE SAVED\r\n\r\nTO C. H. RAY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Nov.20, 1858\r\n\r\nDR. C. H. RAY\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I wish to preserve a set of the late debates (if they may be\r\ncalled so), between Douglas and myself. To enable me to do so, please get\r\ntwo copies of each number of your paper containing the whole, and send\r\nthem to me by express; and I will pay you for the papers and for\r\nyour trouble. I wish the two sets in order to lay one away in the\r\n[undecipherable word] and to put the other in a scrapbook. Remember, if\r\npart of any debate is on both sides of the sheet it will take two sets to\r\nmake one scrap-book.\r\n\r\nI believe, according to a letter of yours to Hatch, you are \"feeling like\r\nh-ll yet.\" Quit that--you will soon feel better. Another \"blow up\" is\r\ncoming; and we shall have fun again. Douglas managed to be supported\r\nboth as the best instrument to down and to uphold the slave power; but no\r\ningenuity can long keep the antagonism in harmony.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, November 30, 1858\r\n\r\nH. C. WHITNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Being desirous of preserving in some permanent form the late\r\njoint discussion between Douglas and myself, ten days ago I wrote to Dr.\r\nRay, requesting him to forward to me by express two sets of the numbers of\r\nthe Tribune which contain the reports of those discussions. Up to date I\r\nhave no word from him on the subject. Will you, if in your power, procure\r\nthem and forward them to me by express? If you will, I will pay all\r\ncharges, and be greatly obliged, to boot. Hoping to visit you before long,\r\nI remain\r\n\r\nAs ever your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. D. SHARPE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. 8, 1858.\r\n\r\nH. D. SHARPE, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your very kind letter of Nov. 9th was duly received. I do\r\nnot know that you expected or desired an answer; but glancing over the\r\ncontents of yours again, I am prompted to say that, while I desired the\r\nresult of the late canvass to have been different, I still regard it as\r\nan exceeding small matter. I think we have fairly entered upon a durable\r\nstruggle as to whether this nation is to ultimately become all slave or\r\nall free, and though I fall early in the contest, it is nothing if I shall\r\nhave contributed, in the least degree, to the final rightful result.\r\n\r\nRespectfully yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. SYMPSON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec.12, 1858.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER SYMPSON, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I expect the result of the election went hard with you. So\r\nit did with me, too, perhaps not quite so hard as you may have supposed.\r\nI have an abiding faith that we shall beat them in the long run. Step by\r\nstep the objects of the leaders will become too plain for the people to\r\nstand them. I write merely to let you know that I am neither dead nor\r\ndying. Please give my respects to your good family, and all inquiring\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON BANKRUPTCY\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES OF AN ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nDecember [?], 1858.\r\n\r\nLegislation and adjudication must follow and conform to the progress of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe progress of society now begins to produce cases of the transfer for\r\ndebts of the entire property of railroad corporations; and to enable\r\ntransferees to use and enjoy the transferred property, legislation and\r\nadjudication begin to be necessary.\r\n\r\nShall this class of legislation just now beginning with us be general or\r\nspecial?\r\n\r\n\r\nSection Ten of our Constitution requires that it should be general,\r\n\r\nif possible. (Read the section.)\r\n\r\nSpecial legislation always trenches upon the judicial department; and in\r\nso far violates Section Two of the Constitution. (Read it.)\r\n\r\nJust reasoning--policy--is in favor of general legislation--else the\r\nLegislature will be loaded down with the investigation of smaller\r\ncases--a work which the courts ought to perform, and can perform much more\r\nperfectly. How can the Legislature rightly decide the facts between P. &\r\nB. and S.C.\r\n\r\nIt is said that under a general law, whenever a R. R. Co. gets tired\r\nof its debts, it may transfer fraudulently to get rid of them. So they\r\nmay--so may individuals; and which--the Legislature or the courts--is best\r\nsuited to try the question of fraud in either case?\r\n\r\nIt is said, if a purchaser have acquired legal rights, let him not be\r\nrobbed of them, but if he needs legislation let him submit to just terms\r\nto obtain it.\r\n\r\nLet him, say we, have general law in advance (guarded in every possible\r\nway against fraud), so that, when he acquires a legal right, he will have\r\nno occasion to wait for additional legislation; and if he has practiced\r\nfraud let the courts so decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LEGAL OPINION BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nThe 11th Section of the Act of Congress, approved Feb. 11, 1805,\r\nprescribing rules for the subdivision of sections of land within the\r\nUnited States system of surveys, standing unrepealed, in my opinion,\r\nis binding on the respective purchasers of different parts of the same\r\nsection, and furnishes the true rule for surveyors in establishing\r\nlines between them. That law, being in force at the time each became a\r\npurchaser, becomes a condition of the purchase.\r\n\r\nAnd, by that law, I think the true rule for dividing into quarters any\r\ninterior section or sections, which is not fractional, is to run straight\r\nlines through the section from the opposite quarter section corners,\r\nfixing the point where such straight lines cross, or intersect each other,\r\nas the middle or centre of the section.\r\n\r\nNearly, perhaps quite, all the original surveys are to some extent\r\nerroneous, and in some of the sections, greatly so. In each of the latter,\r\nit is obvious that a more equitable mode of division than the above might\r\nbe adopted; but as error is infinitely various perhaps no better single\r\nrules can be prescribed.\r\n\r\nAt all events I think the above has been prescribed by the competent\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Jany. 6, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. W. DELAHAY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 4, 1859.\r\n\r\nM. W. DELAHAY, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Your second letter in relation to my being with you at your\r\nRepublican convention was duly received. It is not at hand just now, but I\r\nhave the impression from it that the convention was to be at Leavenworth;\r\nbut day before yesterday a friend handed me a letter from Judge M. F.\r\nCaraway, in which he also expresses a wish for me to come, and he fixes\r\nthe place at Ossawatomie. This I believe is off of the river, and will\r\nrequire more time and labor to get to it. It will push me hard to get\r\nthere without injury to my own business; but I shall try to do it, though\r\nI am not yet quite certain I shall succeed.\r\n\r\nI should like to know before coming, that while some of you wish me to\r\ncome, there may not be others who would quite as lief I would stay away.\r\nWrite me again.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. M. MORRIS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 28, 1859.\r\n\r\nW. M. MORRIS, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your kind note inviting me to deliver a lecture at Galesburg is\r\nreceived. I regret to say I cannot do so now; I must stick to the courts\r\nawhile. I read a sort of lecture to three different audiences during the\r\nlast month and this; but I did so under circumstances which made it a\r\nwaste of no time whatever.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. L. PIERCE AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April 6, 1859.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your kind note inviting me to attend a festival in Boston, on\r\nthe 28th instant, in honor of the birthday of Thomas Jefferson, was duly\r\nreceived. My engagements are such that I cannot attend.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that about seventy years ago two great political parties\r\nwere first formed in this country, that Thomas Jefferson was the head of\r\none of them and Boston the headquarters of the other, it is both curious\r\nand interesting that those supposed to descend politically from the party\r\nopposed to Jefferson should now be celebrating his birthday in their own\r\noriginal seat of empire, while those claiming political descent from him\r\nhave nearly ceased to breathe his name everywhere.\r\n\r\nRemembering, too, that the Jefferson party was formed upon its supposed\r\nsuperior devotion to the personal rights of men, holding the rights of\r\nproperty to be secondary only, and greatly inferior, and assuming that the\r\nso-called Democracy of to-day are the Jefferson, and their opponents\r\nthe anti-Jefferson, party, it will be equally interesting to note how\r\ncompletely the two have changed hands as to the principle upon which they\r\nwere originally supposed to be divided. The Democracy of to-day hold the\r\nliberty of one man to be absolutely nothing, when in conflict with another\r\nman's right of property; Republicans, on the contrary, are for both the\r\nman and the dollar, but in case of conflict the man before the dollar.\r\n\r\nI remember being once much amused at seeing two partially intoxicated men\r\nengaged in a fight with their great-coats on, which fight, after a long\r\nand rather harmless contest, ended in each having fought himself out of\r\nhis own coat and into that of the other. If the two leading parties of\r\nthis day are really identical with the two in the days of Jefferson and\r\nAdams, they have performed the same feat as the two drunken men.\r\n\r\nBut soberly, it is now no child's play to save the principles of Jefferson\r\nfrom total overthrow in this nation. One would state with great confidence\r\nthat he could convince any sane child that the simpler propositions of\r\nEuclid are true; but nevertheless he would fail, utterly, with one who\r\nshould deny the definitions and axioms. The principles of Jefferson are\r\nthe definitions and axioms of free society. And yet they are denied\r\nand evaded, with no small show of success. One dashingly calls them\r\n\"glittering generalities.\" Another bluntly calls them \"self-evident lies.\"\r\nAnd others insidiously argue that they apply to \"superior races.\" These\r\nexpressions, differing in form, are identical in object and effect--the\r\nsupplanting the principles of free government, and restoring those of\r\nclassification, caste, and legitimacy. They would delight a convocation\r\nof crowned heads plotting against the people. They are the vanguard, the\r\nminers and sappers, of returning despotism. We must repulse them, or they\r\nwill subjugate us. This is a world of compensation; and he who would be\r\nno slave must consent to have no slave. Those who deny freedom to others\r\ndeserve it not for themselves, and, under a just God, cannot long retain\r\nit. All honor to Jefferson to the man who, in the concrete pressure of a\r\nstruggle for national independence by a single people, had the coolness,\r\nforecast, and capacity to introduce into a mere revolutionary document an\r\nabstract truth, applicable to all men and all times, and so to embalm\r\nit there that to-day and in all coming days it shall be a rebuke and\r\na stumbling-block to the very harbingers of reappearing tyranny and\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. CANISIUS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, May 17, 1859.\r\n\r\nDR. THEODORE CANISIUS.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your note asking, in behalf of yourself and other German\r\ncitizens, whether I am for or against the constitutional provision in\r\nregard to naturalized citizens, lately adopted by Massachusetts, and\r\nwhether I am for or against a fusion of the Republicans and other\r\nopposition elements for the canvass of 1860, is received.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts is a sovereign and independent State; and it is no privilege\r\nof mine to scold her for what she does. Still, if from what she has done\r\nan inference is sought to be drawn as to what I would do, I may\r\nwithout impropriety speak out. I say, then, that, as I understand the\r\nMassachusetts provision, I am against its adoption in Illinois, or in any\r\nother place where I have a right to oppose it. Understanding the spirit of\r\nour institutions to aim at the elevation of men, I am opposed to whatever\r\ntends to degrade them. I have some little notoriety for commiserating the\r\noppressed negro; and I should be strangely inconsistent if I could favor\r\nany project for curtailing the existing rights of white men, even though\r\nborn in different lands, and speaking different languages from myself.\r\nAs to the matter of fusion, I am for it if it can be had on Republican\r\ngrounds; and I am not for it on any other terms. A fusion on any other\r\nterms would be as foolish as unprincipled. It would lose the whole North,\r\nwhile the common enemy would still carry the whole South. The question of\r\nmen is a different one. There are good, patriotic men and able statesmen\r\nin the South whom I would cheerfully support, if they would now place\r\nthemselves on Republican ground, but I am against letting down the\r\nRepublican standard a hairsbreadth.\r\n\r\nI have written this hastily, but I believe it answers your questions\r\nsubstantially.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR, AUDITOR, AND TREASURER OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nIn reply to your inquiry; requesting our written opinion as to what your\r\nduty requires you to do in executing the latter clause of the Seventh\r\nSection of \"An Act in relation to the payment of the principal and\r\ninterest of the State debt,\" approved Feb'y 22, 1859, we reply that\r\nsaid last clause of said section is certainly indefinite, general, and\r\nambiguous in its description of the bonds to be issued by you; giving no\r\ntime at which the bonds are to be made payable, no place at which either\r\nprincipal or interest are to be paid, and no rate of interest which the\r\nbonds are to bear; nor any other description except that they are to be\r\ncoupon bonds, which in commercial usage means interest-paying bonds\r\nwith obligations or orders attached to them for the payment of annual or\r\nsemiannual interest; there is we suppose no difficulty in ascertaining,\r\nif this act stood alone, what ought to be the construction of the terms\r\n\"coupon bonds\" and that it, would mean bonds bearing interest from the\r\ntime of issuing the same. And under this act considered by itself the\r\ncreditors would have a right to require such bonds. But your inquiry in\r\nregard to a class of bonds on which no interest is to be paid or shall\r\nbegin to run until January 1, 1860, is whether the Act of February 18,\r\n1857, would not authorize you to refuse to give bonds with any coupons\r\nattached payable before the first day of July, 1860. We have very maturely\r\nconsidered this question and have arrived at the conclusion that you have\r\na right to use such measures as will secure the State against the loss of\r\nsix months' interest on these bonds by the indefiniteness of the Act of\r\n1859. While it cannot be denied that the letter of the laws favor the\r\nconstruction claimed by some of the creditors that interest-bearing bonds\r\nwere required to be issued to them, inasmuch as the restriction that no\r\ninterest is to run on said bonds until 1st January, 1860, relates solely\r\nto the bonds issued under the Act of 1857. And the Act of 1859 directing\r\nyou to issue new bonds does not contain this restriction, but directs you\r\nto issue coupon bonds. Nevertheless the very indefiniteness and generality\r\nof the Act of 1859, giving no rate of interest, no time due, no place of\r\npayment, no postponement of the time when interest commences, necessarily\r\nimplies that the Legislature intended to invest you with a discretion to\r\nimpose such terms and restrictions as would protect the interest of the\r\nState; and we think you have a right and that it is your duty to see that\r\nthe State Bonds are so issued that the State shall not lose six months'\r\ninterest. Two plans present themselves either of which will secure the\r\nState. 1st. If in literal compliance with the law you issue bonds bearing\r\ninterest from 1st July, 1859, you may deduct from the bonds presented\r\nthree thousand from every $100,000 of bonds and issue $97,000 of\r\ncoupon bonds; by this plan $3000 out of $100,000 of principal would be\r\nextinguished in consideration of paying $2910 interest on the first of\r\nJanuary, 1860--and the interest on the $3000 would forever cease; this\r\nwould be no doubt most advantageous to the State. But if the Auditor\r\nwill not consent to this, then, 2nd. Cut off of each bond all the coupons\r\npayable before 1st July, 1860.\r\n\r\nOne of these plans would undoubtedly have been prescribed by the\r\nLegislature if its attention had been directed to this question.\r\n\r\nMay 28, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON LINCOLN'S SCRAP BOOK\r\n\r\nTO H. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, December 25, 1858.\r\n\r\nH. C. WHITNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have just received yours of the 23rd inquiring whether I\r\nreceived the newspapers you sent me by express. I did receive them, and\r\nam very much obliged. There is some probability that my scrap-book will be\r\nreprinted, and if it shall, I will save you a copy.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1859\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SUGGESTION OF A PRESIDENTIAL OFFER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO S. GALLOWAY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., July 28, 1859.\r\n\r\nHON. SAMUEL GALLOWAY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your very complimentary, not to say flattering, letter of\r\nthe 23d inst. is received. Dr. Reynolds had induced me to expect you here;\r\nand I was disappointed not a little by your failure to come. And yet I\r\nfear you have formed an estimate of me which can scarcely be sustained on\r\na personal acquaintance.\r\n\r\nTwo things done by the Ohio Republican convention--the repudiation of\r\nJudge Swan, and the \"plank\" for a repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law--I very\r\nmuch regretted. These two things are of a piece; and they are viewed by\r\nmany good men, sincerely opposed to slavery, as a struggle against, and in\r\ndisregard of, the Constitution itself. And it is the very thing that\r\nwill greatly endanger our cause, if it be not kept out of our national\r\nconvention. There is another thing our friends are doing which gives me\r\nsome uneasiness. It is their leaning toward \"popular sovereignty.\" There\r\nare three substantial objections to this: First, no party can command\r\nrespect which sustains this year what it opposed last. Secondly, Douglas\r\n(who is the most dangerous enemy of liberty, because the most insidious\r\none) would have little support in the North, and by consequence, no\r\ncapital to trade on in the South, if it were not for his friends thus\r\nmagnifying him and his humbug. But lastly, and chiefly, Douglas's popular\r\nsovereignty, accepted by the public mind as a just principle, nationalizes\r\nslavery, and revives the African slave trade inevitably.\r\n\r\nTaking slaves into new Territories, and buying slaves in Africa, are\r\nidentical things, identical rights or identical wrongs, and the argument\r\nwhich establishes one will establish the other. Try a thousand years for\r\na sound reason why Congress shall not hinder the people of Kansas from\r\nhaving slaves, and, when you have found it, it will be an equally good one\r\nwhy Congress should not hinder the people of Georgia from importing slaves\r\nfrom Africa.\r\n\r\nAs to Governor Chase, I have a kind side for him. He was one of the few\r\ndistinguished men of the nation who gave us, in Illinois, their sympathy\r\nlast year. I never saw him, but suppose him to be able and right-minded;\r\nbut still he may not be the most suitable as a candidate for the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nI must say I do not think myself fit for the Presidency. As you propose a\r\ncorrespondence with me, I shall look for your letters anxiously.\r\n\r\nI have not met Dr. Reynolds since receiving your letter; but when I shall,\r\nI will present your respects as requested.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT IS BAD TO BE POOR.\r\n\r\nTO HAWKINS TAYLOR\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. Sept. 6, 1859.\r\n\r\nHAWKINS TAYLOR, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 3d is just received. There is some mistake about\r\nmy expected attendance of the U.S. Court in your city on the 3d Tuesday of\r\nthis month. I have had no thought of being there.\r\n\r\nIt is bad to be poor. I shall go to the wall for bread and meat if I\r\nneglect my business this year as well as last. It would please me much\r\nto see the city and good people of Keokuk, but for this year it is little\r\nless than an impossibility. I am constantly receiving invitations which I\r\nam compelled to decline. I was pressingly urged to go to Minnesota; and I\r\nnow have two invitations to go to Ohio. These last are prompted by Douglas\r\ngoing there; and I am really tempted to make a flying trip to Columbus and\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\nI do hope you will have no serious trouble in Iowa. What thinks Grimes\r\nabout it? I have not known him to be mistaken about an election in Iowa.\r\nPresent my respects to Col. Carter, and any other friends, and believe me\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT COLUMBUS, OHIO.\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 16, 1859.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF OHIO: I cannot fail to remember that I\r\nappear for the first time before an audience in this now great State,--an\r\naudience that is accustomed to hear such speakers as Corwin, and Chase,\r\nand Wade, and many other renowned men; and, remembering this, I feel\r\nthat it will be well for you, as for me, that you should not raise your\r\nexpectations to that standard to which you would have been justified in\r\nraising them had one of these distinguished men appeared before you. You\r\nwould perhaps be only preparing a disappointment for yourselves, and, as\r\na consequence of your disappointment, mortification to me. I hope,\r\ntherefore, that you will commence with very moderate expectations; and\r\nperhaps, if you will give me your attention, I shall be able to interest\r\nyou to a moderate degree.\r\n\r\nAppearing here for the first time in my life, I have been somewhat\r\nembarrassed for a topic by way of introduction to my speech; but I have\r\nbeen relieved from that embarrassment by an introduction which the Ohio\r\nStatesman newspaper gave me this morning. In this paper I have read an\r\narticle, in which, among other statements, I find the following:\r\n\r\n\"In debating with Senator Douglas during the memorable contest of last\r\nfall, Mr. Lincoln declared in favor of negro suffrage, and attempted to\r\ndefend that vile conception against the Little Giant.\"\r\n\r\nI mention this now, at the opening of my remarks, for the purpose of\r\nmaking three comments upon it. The first I have already announced,--it\r\nfurnishes me an introductory topic; the second is to show that the\r\ngentleman is mistaken; thirdly, to give him an opportunity to correct it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, in regard to this matter being a mistake. I have found\r\nthat it is not entirely safe, when one is misrepresented under his very\r\nnose, to allow the misrepresentation to go uncontradicted. I\r\ntherefore propose, here at the outset, not only to say that this is a\r\nmisrepresentation, but to show conclusively that it is so; and you will\r\nbear with me while I read a couple of extracts from that very \"memorable\"\r\ndebate with Judge Douglas last year, to which this newspaper refers. In\r\nthe first pitched battle which Senator Douglas and myself had, at the\r\ntown of Ottawa, I used the language which I will now read. Having been\r\npreviously reading an extract, I continued as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length, but this is\r\nthe true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution\r\nof slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it; and anything that\r\nargues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the\r\nnegro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a\r\nman can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse. I will say here,\r\nwhile upon this subject, that I have no purpose directly or indirectly to\r\ninterfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists.\r\nI believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do\r\nso. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between\r\nthe white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the\r\ntwo which, in my judgment, will probably forbid their ever living together\r\nupon the footing of perfect equality; and inasmuch as it becomes a\r\nnecessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas,\r\nam in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I\r\nhave never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding\r\nall this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to\r\nall the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence,--the\r\nright to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as\r\nmuch entitled to these as the white man. I agree with judge Douglas, he\r\nis not my equal in many respects,--certainly not in color, perhaps not\r\nin moral or intellectual endowments. But in the right to eat the bread,\r\nwithout leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal,\r\nand the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.\"\r\n\r\nUpon a subsequent occasion, when the reason for making a statement like\r\nthis occurred, I said:\r\n\r\n\"While I was at the hotel to-day an elderly gentleman called upon me to\r\nknow whether I was really in favor of producing perfect equality between\r\nthe negroes and white people. While I had not proposed to myself on this\r\noccasion to say much on that subject, yet, as the question was asked me, I\r\nthought I would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard\r\nto it. I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of\r\nbringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white\r\nand black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making\r\nvoters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, or\r\nintermarry with the white people; and I will say in addition to this that\r\nthere is a physical difference between the white and black races which\r\nI believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of\r\nsocial and political equality. And inasmuch as they can not so live,\r\nwhile they do remain together there must be the position of superior\r\nand inferior, and I, as much as any other man, am in favor of having the\r\nsuperior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion\r\nI do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior\r\nposition, the negro should be denied everything. I do not understand that\r\nbecause I do not want a negro woman for a slave, I must necessarily want\r\nher for a wife. My understanding is that I can just let her alone. I am\r\nnow in my fiftieth year, and I certainly never have had a black woman for\r\neither a slave or a wife. So it seems to me quite possible for us to get\r\nalong without making either slaves or wives of negroes. I will add to this\r\nthat I have never seen, to my knowledge, a man, woman, or child, who was\r\nin favor of producing perfect equality, social and political, between\r\nnegroes and white men. I recollect of but one distinguished instance that\r\nI ever heard of so frequently as to be satisfied of its correctness, and\r\nthat is the case of Judge Douglas's old friend Colonel Richard M. Johnson.\r\nI will also add to the remarks I have made (for I am not going to enter\r\nat large upon this subject), that I have never had the least apprehension\r\nthat I or my friends would marry negroes, if there was no law to keep\r\nthem from it; but as judge Douglas and his friends seem to be in great\r\napprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I\r\ngive him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the\r\nlaw of the State which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes.\"\r\n\r\nThere, my friends, you have briefly what I have, upon former occasions,\r\nsaid upon this subject to which this newspaper, to the extent of its\r\nability, has drawn the public attention. In it you not only perceive, as a\r\nprobability, that in that contest I did not at any time say I was in favor\r\nof negro suffrage, but the absolute proof that twice--once substantially,\r\nand once expressly--I declared against it. Having shown you this, there\r\nremains but a word of comment upon that newspaper article. It is this,\r\nthat I presume the editor of that paper is an honest and truth-loving man,\r\nand that he will be greatly obliged to me for furnishing him thus early\r\nan opportunity to correct the misrepresentation he has made, before it has\r\nrun so long that malicious people can call him a liar.\r\n\r\nThe Giant himself has been here recently. I have seen a brief report of\r\nhis speech. If it were otherwise unpleasant to me to introduce the subject\r\nof the negro as a topic for discussion, I might be somewhat relieved by\r\nthe fact that he dealt exclusively in that subject while he was here. I\r\nshall, therefore, without much hesitation or diffidence, enter upon this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe American people, on the first day of January, 1854, found the African\r\nslave trade prohibited by a law of Congress. In a majority of the States\r\nof this Union, they found African slavery, or any other sort of slavery,\r\nprohibited by State constitutions. They also found a law existing,\r\nsupposed to be valid, by which slavery was excluded from almost all the\r\nterritory the United States then owned. This was the condition of the\r\ncountry, with reference to the institution of slavery, on the first of\r\nJanuary, 1854. A few days after that, a bill was introduced into Congress,\r\nwhich ran through its regular course in the two branches of the national\r\nlegislature, and finally passed into a law in the month of May, by which\r\nthe Act of Congress prohibiting slavery from going into the Territories of\r\nthe United States was repealed. In connection with the law itself, and, in\r\nfact, in the terms of the law, the then existing prohibition was not only\r\nrepealed, but there was a declaration of a purpose on the part of Congress\r\nnever thereafter to exercise any power that they might have, real or\r\nsupposed, to prohibit the extension or spread of slavery. This was a very\r\ngreat change; for the law thus repealed was of more than thirty years'\r\nstanding. Following rapidly upon the heels of this action of Congress,\r\na decision of the Supreme Court is made, by which it is declared that\r\nCongress, if it desires to prohibit the spread of slavery into the\r\nTerritories, has no constitutional power to do so. Not only so, but\r\nthat decision lays down principles which, if pushed to their logical\r\nconclusion,--I say pushed to their logical conclusion,--would decide\r\nthat the constitutions of free States, forbidding slavery, are themselves\r\nunconstitutional. Mark me, I do not say the judges said this, and let\r\nno man say I affirm the judges used these words; but I only say it is my\r\nopinion that what they did say, if pressed to its logical conclusion, will\r\ninevitably result thus.\r\n\r\nLooking at these things, the Republican party, as I understand its\r\nprinciples and policy, believes that there is great danger of the\r\ninstitution of slavery being spread out and extended until it is\r\nultimately made alike lawful in all the States of this Union; so\r\nbelieving, to prevent that incidental and ultimate consummation is the\r\noriginal and chief purpose of the Republican organization. I say \"chief\r\npurpose\" of the Republican organization; for it is certainly true that if\r\nthe National House shall fall into the hands of the Republicans, they will\r\nhave to attend to all the other matters of national house-keeping, as well\r\nas this. The chief and real purpose of the Republican party is eminently\r\nconservative. It proposes nothing save and except to restore this\r\ngovernment to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery, and\r\nthere to maintain it, looking for no further change in reference to it\r\nthan that which the original framers of the Government themselves expected\r\nand looked forward to.\r\n\r\nThe chief danger to this purpose of the Republican party is not just now\r\nthe revival of the African slave trade, or the passage of a Congressional\r\nslave code, or the declaring of a second Dred Scott decision, making\r\nslavery lawful in all the States. These are not pressing us just now. They\r\nare not quite ready yet. The authors of these measures know that we are\r\ntoo strong for them; but they will be upon us in due time, and we will be\r\ngrappling with them hand to hand, if they are not now headed off. They are\r\nnot now the chief danger to the purpose of the Republican organization;\r\nbut the most imminent danger that now threatens that purpose is that\r\ninsidious Douglas popular sovereignty. This is the miner and sapper. While\r\nit does not propose to revive the African slave trade, nor to pass a slave\r\ncode, nor to make a second Dred Scott decision, it is preparing us for the\r\nonslaught and charge of these ultimate enemies when they shall be ready to\r\ncome on, and the word of command for them to advance shall be given. I say\r\nthis \"Douglas popular sovereignty\"; for there is a broad distinction, as I\r\nnow understand it, between that article and a genuine popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\nI believe there is a genuine popular sovereignty. I think a definition of\r\n\"genuine popular sovereignty,\" in the abstract, would be about this: That\r\neach man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself, and with all\r\nthose things which exclusively concern him. Applied to government, this\r\nprinciple would be, that a general government shall do all those things\r\nwhich pertain to it, and all the local governments shall do precisely as\r\nthey please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them. I\r\nunderstand that this government of the United States, under which we live,\r\nis based upon this principle; and I am misunderstood if it is supposed\r\nthat I have any war to make upon that principle.\r\n\r\nNow, what is judge Douglas's popular sovereignty? It is, as a principle,\r\nno other than that if one man chooses to make a slave of another man\r\nneither that other man nor anybody else has a right to object. Applied in\r\ngovernment, as he seeks to apply it, it is this: If, in a new Territory\r\ninto which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making\r\ntheir homes, they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits or to\r\nestablish it there, however one or the other may affect the persons to be\r\nenslaved, or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterwards\r\nto inhabit that Territory, or the other members of the families of\r\ncommunities, of which they are but an incipient member, or the general\r\nhead of the family of States as parent of all, however their action may\r\naffect one or the other of these, there is no power or right to interfere.\r\nThat is Douglas's popular sovereignty applied.\r\n\r\nHe has a good deal of trouble with popular sovereignty. His explanations\r\nexplanatory of explanations explained are interminable. The most lengthy,\r\nand, as I suppose, the most maturely considered of this long series of\r\nexplanations is his great essay in Harper's Magazine. I will not attempt\r\nto enter on any very thorough investigation of his argument as there made\r\nand presented. I will nevertheless occupy a good portion of your time here\r\nin drawing your attention to certain points in it. Such of you as may\r\nhave read this document will have perceived that the judge early in the\r\ndocument quotes from two persons as belonging to the Republican party,\r\nwithout naming them, but who can readily be recognized as being Governor\r\nSeward of New York and myself. It is true that exactly fifteen months ago\r\nthis day, I believe, I for the first time expressed a sentiment upon this\r\nsubject, and in such a manner that it should get into print, that the\r\npublic might see it beyond the circle of my hearers; and my expression of\r\nit at that time is the quotation that Judge Douglas makes. He has not made\r\nthe quotation with accuracy, but justice to him requires me to say that it\r\nis sufficiently accurate not to change the sense.\r\n\r\nThe sense of that quotation condensed is this: that this slavery element\r\nis a durable element of discord among us, and that we shall probably not\r\nhave perfect peace in this country with it until it either masters the\r\nfree principle in our government, or is so far mastered by the free\r\nprinciple as for the public mind to rest in the belief that it is going to\r\nits end. This sentiment, which I now express in this way, was, at no great\r\ndistance of time, perhaps in different language, and in connection with\r\nsome collateral ideas, expressed by Governor Seward. Judge Douglas has\r\nbeen so much annoyed by the expression of that sentiment that he has\r\nconstantly, I believe, in almost all his speeches since it was uttered,\r\nbeen referring to it. I find he alluded to it in his speech here, as well\r\nas in the copyright essay. I do not now enter upon this for the purpose of\r\nmaking an elaborate argument to show that we were right in the expression\r\nof that sentiment. In other words, I shall not stop to say all that might\r\nproperly be said upon this point, but I only ask your attention to it for\r\nthe purpose of making one or two points upon it.\r\n\r\nIf you will read the copyright essay, you will discover that judge\r\nDouglas himself says a controversy between the American Colonies and the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain began on the slavery question in 1699, and\r\ncontinued from that time until the Revolution; and, while he did not say\r\nso, we all know that it has continued with more or less violence ever\r\nsince the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThen we need not appeal to history, to the declarations of the framers of\r\nthe government, but we know from judge Douglas himself that slavery began\r\nto be an element of discord among the white people of this country as far\r\nback as 1699, or one hundred and sixty years ago, or five generations of\r\nmen,--counting thirty years to a generation. Now, it would seem to me that\r\nit might have occurred to Judge Douglas, or anybody who had turned his\r\nattention to these facts, that there was something in the nature of that\r\nthing, slavery, somewhat durable for mischief and discord.\r\n\r\nThere is another point I desire to make in regard to this matter, before\r\nI leave it. From the adoption of the Constitution down to 1820 is the\r\nprecise period of our history when we had comparative peace upon this\r\nquestion,--the precise period of time when we came nearer to having peace\r\nabout it than any other time of that entire one hundred and sixty years\r\nin which he says it began, or of the eighty years of our own Constitution.\r\nThen it would be worth our while to stop and examine into the probable\r\nreason of our coming nearer to having peace then than at any other time.\r\nThis was the precise period of time in which our fathers adopted, and\r\nduring which they followed, a policy restricting the spread of slavery,\r\nand the whole Union was acquiescing in it. The whole country looked\r\nforward to the ultimate extinction of the institution. It was when a\r\npolicy had been adopted, and was prevailing, which led all just and\r\nright-minded men to suppose that slavery was gradually coming to an end,\r\nand that they might be quiet about it, watching it as it expired. I think\r\nJudge Douglas might have perceived that too; and whether he did or not, it\r\nis worth the attention of fair-minded men, here and elsewhere, to consider\r\nwhether that is not the truth of the case. If he had looked at these two\r\nfacts,--that this matter has been an element of discord for one hundred\r\nand sixty years among this people, and that the only comparative peace we\r\nhave had about it was when that policy prevailed in this government which\r\nhe now wars upon, he might then, perhaps, have been brought to a more just\r\nappreciation of what I said fifteen months ago,--that \"a house divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand. I believe that this government cannot endure\r\npermanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the house to fall,\r\nI do not expect the Union to dissolve; but I do expect it will cease to\r\nbe divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the\r\nopponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it\r\nwhere the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of\r\nultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward until it shall\r\nbecome alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well\r\nas South.\" That was my sentiment at that time. In connection with it, I\r\nsaid: \"We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was inaugurated\r\nwith the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery\r\nagitation. Under the operation of the policy that agitation has not only\r\nnot ceased, but has constantly augmented.\" I now say to you here that we\r\nare advanced still farther into the sixth year since that policy of\r\nJudge Douglas--that popular sovereignty of his--for quieting the slavery\r\nquestion was made the national policy. Fifteen months more have been\r\nadded since I uttered that sentiment; and I call upon you and all other\r\nright-minded men to say whether that fifteen months have belied or\r\ncorroborated my words.\r\n\r\nWhile I am here upon this subject, I cannot but express gratitude that\r\nthis true view of this element of discord among us--as I believe it is--is\r\nattracting more and more attention. I do not believe that Governor Seward\r\nuttered that sentiment because I had done so before, but because he\r\nreflected upon this subject and saw the truth of it. Nor do I believe\r\nbecause Governor Seward or I uttered it that Mr. Hickman of Pennsylvania,\r\nin, different language, since that time, has declared his belief in\r\nthe utter antagonism which exists between the principles of liberty and\r\nslavery. You see we are multiplying. Now, while I am speaking of Hickman,\r\nlet me say, I know but little about him. I have never seen him, and know\r\nscarcely anything about the man; but I will say this much of him: Of all\r\nthe anti-Lecompton Democracy that have been brought to my notice, he\r\nalone has the true, genuine ring of the metal. And now, without indorsing\r\nanything else he has said, I will ask this audience to give three cheers\r\nfor Hickman. [The audience responded with three rousing cheers for\r\nHickman.]\r\n\r\nAnother point in the copyright essay to which I would ask your attention\r\nis rather a feature to be extracted from the whole thing, than from any\r\nexpress declaration of it at any point. It is a general feature of that\r\ndocument, and, indeed, of all of Judge Douglas's discussions of this\r\nquestion, that the Territories of the United States and the States of this\r\nUnion are exactly alike; that there is no difference between them at all;\r\nthat the Constitution applies to the Territories precisely as it does to\r\nthe States; and that the United States Government, under the Constitution,\r\nmay not do in a State what it may not do in a Territory, and what it must\r\ndo in a State it must do in a Territory. Gentlemen, is that a true view of\r\nthe case? It is necessary for this squatter sovereignty, but is it true?\r\n\r\nLet us consider. What does it depend upon? It depends altogether upon the\r\nproposition that the States must, without the interference of the\r\nGeneral Government, do all those things that pertain exclusively to\r\nthemselves,--that are local in their nature, that have no connection\r\nwith the General Government. After Judge Douglas has established this\r\nproposition, which nobody disputes or ever has disputed, he proceeds\r\nto assume, without proving it, that slavery is one of those little,\r\nunimportant, trivial matters which are of just about as much consequence\r\nas the question would be to me whether my neighbor should raise horned\r\ncattle or plant tobacco; that there is no moral question about it, but\r\nthat it is altogether a matter of dollars and cents; that when a new\r\nTerritory is opened for settlement, the first man who goes into it may\r\nplant there a thing which, like the Canada thistle or some other of those\r\npests of the soil, cannot be dug out by the millions of men who will come\r\nthereafter; that it is one of those little things that is so trivial in\r\nits nature that it has nor effect upon anybody save the few men who first\r\nplant upon the soil; that it is not a thing which in any way affects the\r\nfamily of communities composing these States, nor any way endangers the\r\nGeneral Government. Judge Douglas ignores altogether the very well known\r\nfact that we have never had a serious menace to our political existence,\r\nexcept it sprang from this thing, which he chooses to regard as only upon\r\na par with onions and potatoes.\r\n\r\nTurn it, and contemplate it in another view. He says that, according\r\nto his popular sovereignty, the General Government may give to the\r\nTerritories governors, judges, marshals, secretaries, and all the other\r\nchief men to govern them, but they, must not touch upon this other\r\nquestion. Why? The question of who shall be governor of a Territory for a\r\nyear or two, and pass away, without his track being left upon the soil, or\r\nan act which he did for good or for evil being left behind, is a question\r\nof vast national magnitude; it is so much opposed in its nature to\r\nlocality that the nation itself must decide it: while this other matter\r\nof planting slavery upon a soil,--a thing which, once planted, cannot be\r\neradicated by the succeeding millions who have as much right there as the\r\nfirst comers, or, if eradicated, not without infinite difficulty and\r\na long struggle, he considers the power to prohibit it as one of these\r\nlittle local, trivial things that the nation ought not to say a word\r\nabout; that it affects nobody save the few men who are there.\r\n\r\nTake these two things and consider them together, present the question of\r\nplanting a State with the institution of slavery by the side of a question\r\nwho shall be Governor of Kansas for a year or two, and is there a man\r\nhere, is there a man on earth, who would not say the governor question\r\nis the little one, and the slavery question is the great one? I ask any\r\nhonest Democrat if the small, the local, and the trivial and temporary\r\nquestion is not, Who shall be governor? while the durable, the important,\r\nand the mischievous one is, Shall this soil be planted with slavery?\r\n\r\nThis is an idea, I suppose, which has arisen in Judge Douglas's mind from\r\nhis peculiar structure. I suppose the institution of slavery really looks\r\nsmall to him. He is so put up by nature that a lash upon his back would\r\nhurt him, but a lash upon anybody else's back does not hurt him. That is\r\nthe build of the man, and consequently he looks upon the matter of slavery\r\nin this unimportant light.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas ought to remember, when he is endeavoring to force this\r\npolicy upon the American people, that while he is put up in that way,\r\na good many are not. He ought to remember that there was once in\r\nthis country a man by the name of Thomas Jefferson, supposed to be a\r\nDemocrat,--a man whose principles and policy are not very prevalent\r\namongst Democrats to-day, it is true; but that man did not take exactly\r\nthis view of the insignificance of the element of slavery which our friend\r\njudge Douglas does. In contemplation of this thing, we all know he was led\r\nto exclaim, \"I tremble for my country when I remember that God is just!\"\r\nWe know how he looked upon it when he thus expressed himself. There was\r\ndanger to this country,--danger of the avenging justice of God, in that\r\nlittle unimportant popular sovereignty question of judge Douglas. He\r\nsupposed there was a question of God's eternal justice wrapped up in the\r\nenslaving of any race of men, or any man, and that those who did so braved\r\nthe arm of Jehovah; that when a nation thus dared the Almighty, every\r\nfriend of that nation had cause to dread his wrath. Choose ye between\r\nJefferson and Douglas as to what is the true view of this element among\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThere is another little difficulty about this matter of treating the\r\nTerritories and States alike in all things, to which I ask your attention,\r\nand I shall leave this branch of the case. If there is no difference\r\nbetween them, why not make the Territories States at once? What is\r\nthe reason that Kansas was not fit to come into the Union when it was\r\norganized into a Territory, in Judge Douglas's view? Can any of you tell\r\nany reason why it should not have come into the Union at once? They are\r\nfit, as he thinks, to decide upon the slavery question,--the largest and\r\nmost important with which they could possibly deal: what could they do by\r\ncoming into the Union that they are not fit to do, according to his view,\r\nby staying out of it? Oh, they are not fit to sit in Congress and decide\r\nupon the rates of postage, or questions of ad valorem or specific duties\r\non foreign goods, or live-oak timber contracts, they are not fit to decide\r\nthese vastly important matters, which are national in their import, but\r\nthey are fit, \"from the jump,\" to decide this little negro question. But,\r\ngentlemen, the case is too plain; I occupy too much time on this head, and\r\nI pass on.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the copyright essay, the judge, I think, comes very near\r\nkicking his own fat into the fire. I did not think, when I commenced these\r\nremarks, that I would read that article, but I now believe I will:\r\n\r\n\"This exposition of the history of these measures shows conclusively that\r\nthe authors of the Compromise measures of 1850 and of the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nAct of 1854, as well as the members of the Continental Congress of 1774.,\r\nand the founders of our system of government subsequent to the Revolution,\r\nregarded the people of the Territories and Colonies as political\r\ncommunities which were entitled to a free and exclusive power of\r\nlegislation in their provisional legislatures, where their representation\r\ncould alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and internal polity.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the judge saw that putting in the word \"slavery\" would contradict\r\nhis own history, he put in what he knew would pass synonymous with it,\r\n\"internal polity.\" Whenever we find that in one of his speeches, the\r\nsubstitute is used in this manner; and I can tell you the reason. It would\r\nbe too bald a contradiction to say slavery; but \"internal polity\" is a\r\ngeneral phrase, which would pass in some quarters, and which he hopes will\r\npass with the reading community for the same thing.\r\n\r\n\"This right pertains to the people collectively, as a law-abiding and\r\npeaceful community, and not in the isolated individuals who may wander\r\nupon the public domain in violation of the law. It can only be exercised\r\nwhere there are inhabitants sufficient to constitute a government, and\r\ncapable of performing its various functions and duties,--a fact to be\r\nascertained and determined by\" who do you think? Judge Douglas says \"by\r\nCongress!\" \"Whether the number shall be fixed at ten, fifteen or twenty\r\nthousand inhabitants, does not affect the principle.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I have only a few comments to make. Popular sovereignty, by his own\r\nwords, does not pertain to the few persons who wander upon the public\r\ndomain in violation of law. We have his words for that. When it does\r\npertain to them, is when they are sufficient to be formed into an\r\norganized political community, and he fixes the minimum for that at ten\r\nthousand, and the maximum at twenty thousand. Now, I would like to know\r\nwhat is to be done with the nine thousand? Are they all to be treated,\r\nuntil they are large enough to be organized into a political community, as\r\nwanderers upon the public land, in violation of law? And if so treated\r\nand driven out, at what point of time would there ever be ten thousand?\r\nIf they were not driven out, but remained there as trespassers upon the\r\npublic land in violation of the law, can they establish slavery there? No;\r\nthe judge says popular sovereignty don't pertain to them then. Can they\r\nexclude it then? No; popular sovereignty don't pertain to them then. I\r\nwould like to know, in the case covered by the essay, what condition\r\nthe people of the Territory are in before they reach the number of ten\r\nthousand?\r\n\r\nBut the main point I wish to ask attention to is, that the question as\r\nto when they shall have reached a sufficient number to be formed into a\r\nregular organized community is to be decided \"by Congress.\" Judge Douglas\r\nsays so. Well, gentlemen, that is about all we want. No, that is all the\r\nSoutherners want. That is what all those who are for slavery want. They\r\ndo not want Congress to prohibit slavery from coming into the new\r\nTerritories, and they do not want popular sovereignty to hinder it; and as\r\nCongress is to say when they are ready to be organized, all that the South\r\nhas to do is to get Congress to hold off. Let Congress hold off until they\r\nare ready to be admitted as a State, and the South has all it wants in\r\ntaking slavery into and planting it in all the Territories that we now\r\nhave or hereafter may have. In a word, the whole thing, at a dash of the\r\npen, is at last put in the power of Congress; for if they do not have this\r\npopular sovereignty until Congress organizes them, I ask if it at last\r\ndoes not come from Congress? If, at last, it amounts to anything at all,\r\nCongress gives it to them. I submit this rather for your reflection\r\nthan for comment. After all that is said, at last, by a dash of the pen,\r\neverything that has gone before is undone, and he puts the whole question\r\nunder the control of Congress. After fighting through more than three\r\nhours, if you undertake to read it, he at last places the whole matter\r\nunder the control of that power which he has been contending against, and\r\narrives at a result directly contrary to what he had been laboring to do.\r\nHe at last leaves the whole matter to the control of Congress.\r\n\r\nThere are two main objects, as I understand it, of this Harper's Magazine\r\nessay. One was to show, if possible, that the men of our Revolutionary\r\ntimes were in favor of his popular sovereignty, and the other was to show\r\nthat the Dred Scott decision had not entirely squelched out this popular\r\nsovereignty. I do not propose, in regard to this argument drawn from\r\nthe history of former times, to enter into a detailed examination of the\r\nhistorical statements he has made. I have the impression that they are\r\ninaccurate in a great many instances,--sometimes in positive statement,\r\nbut very much more inaccurate by the suppression of statements that really\r\nbelong to the history. But I do not propose to affirm that this is so to\r\nany very great extent, or to enter into a very minute examination of his\r\nhistorical statements. I avoid doing so upon this principle,--that if it\r\nwere important for me to pass out of this lot in the least period of time\r\npossible, and I came to that fence, and saw by a calculation of my known\r\nstrength and agility that I could clear it at a bound, it would be folly\r\nfor me to stop and consider whether I could or not crawl through a crack.\r\nSo I say of the whole history contained in his essay where he endeavored\r\nto link the men of the Revolution to popular sovereignty. It only requires\r\nan effort to leap out of it, a single bound to be entirely successful.\r\nIf you read it over, you will find that he quotes here and there from\r\ndocuments of the Revolutionary times, tending to show that the people of\r\nthe colonies were desirous of regulating their own concerns in their own\r\nway, that the British Government should not interfere; that at one time\r\nthey struggled with the British Government to be permitted to exclude\r\nthe African slave trade,--if not directly, to be permitted to exclude\r\nit indirectly, by taxation sufficient to discourage and destroy it. From\r\nthese and many things of this sort, judge Douglas argues that they were\r\nin favor of the people of our own Territories excluding slavery if they\r\nwanted to, or planting it there if they wanted to, doing just as they\r\npleased from the time they settled upon the Territory. Now, however his\r\nhistory may apply and whatever of his argument there may be that is sound\r\nand accurate or unsound and inaccurate, if we can find out what these men\r\ndid themselves do upon this very question of slavery in the Territories,\r\ndoes it not end the whole thing? If, after all this labor and effort\r\nto show that the men of the Revolution were in favor of his popular\r\nsovereignty and his mode of dealing with slavery in the Territories, we\r\ncan show that these very men took hold of that subject, and dealt with\r\nit, we can see for ourselves how they dealt with it. It is not a matter of\r\nargument or inference, but we know what they thought about it.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely upon that part of the history of the country that one\r\nimportant omission is made by Judge Douglas. He selects parts of the\r\nhistory of the United States upon the subject of slavery, and treats it as\r\nthe whole, omitting from his historical sketch the legislation of Congress\r\nin regard to the admission of Missouri, by which the Missouri Compromise\r\nwas established and slavery excluded from a country half as large as the\r\npresent United States. All this is left out of his history, and in nowise\r\nalluded to by him, so far as I can remember, save once, when he makes\r\na remark, that upon his principle the Supreme Court were authorized to\r\npronounce a decision that the act called the Missouri Compromise was\r\nunconstitutional. All that history has been left out. But this part of the\r\nhistory of the country was not made by the men of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThere was another part of our political history, made by the very men\r\nwho were the actors in the Revolution, which has taken the name of the\r\nOrdinance of '87. Let me bring that history to your attention. In 1784, I\r\nbelieve, this same Mr. Jefferson drew up an ordinance for the government\r\nof the country upon which we now stand, or, rather, a frame or draft of an\r\nordinance for the government of this country, here in Ohio, our neighbors\r\nin Indiana, us who live in Illinois, our neighbors in Wisconsin and\r\nMichigan. In that ordinance, drawn up not only for the government of that\r\nTerritory, but for the Territories south of the Ohio River, Mr. Jefferson\r\nexpressly provided for the prohibition of slavery. Judge Douglas says,\r\nand perhaps is right, that that provision was lost from that ordinance. I\r\nbelieve that is true. When the vote was taken upon it, a majority of all\r\npresent in the Congress of the Confederation voted for it; but there were\r\nso many absentees that those voting for it did not make the clear majority\r\nnecessary, and it was lost. But three years after that, the Congress of\r\nthe Confederation were together again, and they adopted a new ordinance\r\nfor the government of this Northwest Territory, not contemplating\r\nterritory south of the river, for the States owning that territory had\r\nhitherto refrained from giving it to the General Government; hence they\r\nmade the ordinance to apply only to what the Government owned. In fact,\r\nthe provision excluding slavery was inserted aside, passed unanimously, or\r\nat any rate it passed and became a part of the law of the land. Under\r\nthat ordinance we live. First here in Ohio you were a Territory; then an\r\nenabling act was passed, authorizing you to form a constitution and\r\nState Government, provided it was republican and not in conflict with the\r\nOrdinance of '87. When you framed your constitution and presented it for\r\nadmission, I think you will find the legislation upon the subject will\r\nshow that, whereas you had formed a constitution that was republican, and\r\nnot in conflict with the Ordinance of '87, therefore you were admitted\r\nupon equal footing with the original States. The same process in a few\r\nyears was gone through with in Indiana, and so with Illinois, and the same\r\nsubstantially with Michigan and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nNot only did that Ordinance prevail, but it was constantly looked to\r\nwhenever a step was taken by a new Territory to become a State. Congress\r\nalways turned their attention to it, and in all their movements upon\r\nthis subject they traced their course by that Ordinance of '87. When they\r\nadmitted new States, they advertised them of this Ordinance, as a part of\r\nthe legislation of the country. They did so because they had traced the\r\nOrdinance of '87 throughout the history of this country. Begin with the\r\nmen of the Revolution, and go down for sixty entire years, and until the\r\nlast scrap of that Territory comes into the Union in the form of the State\r\nof Wisconsin, everything was made to conform with the Ordinance of '87,\r\nexcluding slavery from that vast extent of country.\r\n\r\nI omitted to mention in the right place that the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States was in process of being framed when that Ordinance was\r\nmade by the Congress of the Confederation; and one of the first Acts of\r\nCongress itself, under the new Constitution itself, was to give force to\r\nthat Ordinance by putting power to carry it out in the hands of the new\r\nofficers under the Constitution, in the place of the old ones, who had\r\nbeen legislated out of existence by the change in the Government from the\r\nConfederation to the Constitution. Not only so, but I believe Indiana once\r\nor twice, if not Ohio, petitioned the General Government for the privilege\r\nof suspending that provision and allowing them to have slaves. A report\r\nmade by Mr. Randolph, of Virginia, himself a slaveholder, was directly\r\nagainst it, and the action was to refuse them the privilege of violating\r\nthe Ordinance of '87.\r\n\r\nThis period of history, which I have run over briefly, is, I presume, as\r\nfamiliar to most of this assembly as any other part of the history of our\r\ncountry. I suppose that few of my hearers are not as familiar with that\r\npart of history as I am, and I only mention it to recall your attention\r\nto it at this time. And hence I ask how extraordinary a thing it is that a\r\nman who has occupied a position upon the floor of the Senate of the United\r\nStates, who is now in his third term, and who looks to see the government\r\nof this whole country fall into his own hands, pretending to give a\r\ntruthful and accurate history o the slavery question in this country,\r\nshould so entirely ignore the whole of that portion of our history--the\r\nmost important of all. Is it not a most extraordinary spectacle that a man\r\nshould stand up and ask for any confidence in his statements who sets out\r\nas he does with portions of history, calling upon the people to believe\r\nthat it is a true and fair representation, when the leading part and\r\ncontrolling feature of the whole history is carefully suppressed?\r\n\r\nBut the mere leaving out is not the most remarkable feature of this most\r\nremarkable essay. His proposition is to establish that the leading men\r\nof the Revolution were for his great principle of nonintervention by the\r\ngovernment in the question of slavery in the Territories, while history\r\nshows that they decided, in the cases actually brought before them, in\r\nexactly the contrary way, and he knows it. Not only did they so decide\r\nat that time, but they stuck to it during sixty years, through thick and\r\nthin, as long as there was one of the Revolutionary heroes upon the stage\r\nof political action. Through their whole course, from first to last, they\r\nclung to freedom. And now he asks the community to believe that the men\r\nof the Revolution were in favor of his great principle, when we have the\r\nnaked history that they themselves dealt with this very subject matter\r\nof his principle, and utterly repudiated his principle, acting upon\r\na precisely contrary ground. It is as impudent and absurd as if a\r\nprosecuting attorney should stand up before a jury and ask them to convict\r\nA as the murderer of B, while B was walking alive before them.\r\n\r\nI say, again, if judge Douglas asserts that the men of the Revolution\r\nacted upon principles by which, to be consistent with themselves, they\r\nought to have adopted his popular sovereignty, then, upon a consideration\r\nof his own argument, he had a right to make you believe that they\r\nunderstood the principles of government, but misapplied them, that he\r\nhas arisen to enlighten the world as to the just application of this\r\nprinciple. He has a right to try to persuade you that he understands their\r\nprinciples better than they did, and, therefore, he will apply them now,\r\nnot as they did, but as they ought to have done. He has a right to go\r\nbefore the community and try to convince them of this, but he has no right\r\nto attempt to impose upon any one the belief that these men themselves\r\napproved of his great principle. There are two ways of establishing a\r\nproposition. One is by trying to demonstrate it upon reason, and the other\r\nis, to show that great men in former times have thought so and so, and\r\nthus to pass it by the weight of pure authority. Now, if Judge Douglas\r\nwill demonstrate somehow that this is popular sovereignty,--the right of\r\none man to make a slave of another, without any right in that other or\r\nany one else to object,--demonstrate it as Euclid demonstrated\r\npropositions,--there is no objection. But when he comes forward, seeking\r\nto carry a principle by bringing to it the authority of men who themselves\r\nutterly repudiate that principle, I ask that he shall not be permitted to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nI see, in the judge's speech here, a short sentence in these words: \"Our\r\nfathers, when they formed this government under which we live, understood\r\nthis question just as well, and even better than, we do now.\" That is\r\ntrue; I stick to that. I will stand by Judge Douglas in that to the bitter\r\nend. And now, Judge Douglas, come and stand by me, and truthfully show how\r\nthey acted, understanding it better than we do. All I ask of you, Judge\r\nDouglas, is to stick to the proposition that the men of the Revolution\r\nunderstood this subject better than we do now, and with that better\r\nunderstanding they acted better than you are trying to act now.\r\n\r\nI wish to say something now in regard to the Dred Scott decision, as dealt\r\nwith by Judge Douglas. In that \"memorable debate\" between Judge Douglas\r\nand myself, last year, the judge thought fit to commence a process of\r\ncatechising me, and at Freeport I answered his questions, and propounded\r\nsome to him. Among others propounded to him was one that I have here now.\r\nThe substance, as I remember it, is, \"Can the people of a United States\r\nTerritory, under the Dred Scott decision, in any lawful way, against the\r\nwish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits,\r\nprior to the formation of a State constitution?\" He answered that they\r\ncould lawfully exclude slavery from the United States Territories,\r\nnotwithstanding the Dred Scot decision. There was something about that\r\nanswer that has probably been a trouble to the judge ever since.\r\n\r\nThe Dred Scott decision expressly gives every citizen of the United States\r\na right to carry his slaves into the United States Territories. And now\r\nthere was some inconsistency in saying that the decision was right, and\r\nsaying, too, that the people of the Territory could lawfully drive slavery\r\nout again. When all the trash, the words, the collateral matter, was\r\ncleared away from it, all the chaff was fanned out of it, it was a bare\r\nabsurdity,--no less than that a thing may be lawfully driven away from\r\nwhere it has a lawful right to be. Clear it of all the verbiage, and\r\nthat is the naked truth of his proposition,--that a thing may be lawfully\r\ndriven from the place where it has a lawful right to stay. Well, it was\r\nbecause the judge could n't help seeing this that he has had so much\r\ntrouble with it; and what I want to ask your especial attention to, just\r\nnow, is to remind you, if you have not noticed the fact, that the judge\r\ndoes not any longer say that the people can exclude slavery. He does not\r\nsay so in the copyright essay; he did not say so in the speech that he\r\nmade here; and, so far as I know, since his re-election to the Senate he\r\nhas never said, as he did at Freeport, that the people of the Territories\r\ncan exclude slavery. He desires that you, who wish the Territories to\r\nremain free, should believe that he stands by that position; but he does\r\nnot say it himself. He escapes to some extent the absurd position I have\r\nstated, by changing his language entirely. What he says now is something\r\ndifferent in language, and we will consider whether it is not different\r\nin sense too. It is now that the Dred Scott decision, or rather the\r\nConstitution under that decision, does not carry slavery into the\r\nTerritories beyond the power of the people of the Territories to control\r\nit as other property. He does not say the people can drive it out, but\r\nthey can control it as other property. The language is different; we\r\nshould consider whether the sense is different. Driving a horse out of\r\nthis lot is too plain a proposition to be mistaken about; it is putting\r\nhim on the other side of the fence. Or it might be a sort of exclusion of\r\nhim from the lot if you were to kill him and let the worms devour him;\r\nbut neither of these things is the same as \"controlling him as other\r\nproperty.\" That would be to feed him, to pamper him, to ride him, to use\r\nand abuse him, to make the most money out of him, \"as other property\";\r\nbut, please you, what do the men who are in favor of slavery want more\r\nthan this? What do they really want, other than that slavery, being in the\r\nTerritories, shall be controlled as other property? If they want anything\r\nelse, I do not comprehend it. I ask your attention to this, first, for the\r\npurpose of pointing out the change of ground the judge has made; and, in\r\nthe second place, the importance of the change,--that that change is not\r\nsuch as to give you gentlemen who want his popular sovereignty the power\r\nto exclude the institution or drive it out at all. I know the judge\r\nsometimes squints at the argument that in controlling it as other property\r\nby unfriendly legislation they may control it to death; as you might, in\r\nthe case of a horse, perhaps, feed him so lightly and ride him so much\r\nthat he would die. But when you come to legislative control, there is\r\nsomething more to be attended to. I have no doubt, myself, that if the\r\nTerritories should undertake to control slave property as other property\r\nthat is, control it in such a way that it would be the most valuable as\r\nproperty, and make it bear its just proportion in the way of burdens\r\nas property, really deal with it as property,--the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States will say, \"God speed you, and amen.\" But I undertake to\r\ngive the opinion, at least, that if the Territories attempt by any direct\r\nlegislation to drive the man with his slave out of the Territory, or to\r\ndecide that his slave is free because of his being taken in there, or to\r\ntax him to such an extent that he cannot keep him there, the Supreme Court\r\nwill unhesitatingly decide all such legislation unconstitutional, as long\r\nas that Supreme Court is constructed as the Dred Scott Supreme Court is.\r\nThe first two things they have already decided, except that there is a\r\nlittle quibble among lawyers between the words \"dicta\" and \"decision.\"\r\nThey have already decided a negro cannot be made free by Territorial\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Dred Scott decision? Judge Douglas labors to show that it is\r\none thing, while I think it is altogether different. It is a long opinion,\r\nbut it is all embodied in this short statement: \"The Constitution of the\r\nUnited States forbids Congress to deprive a man of his property, without\r\ndue process of law; the right of property in slaves is distinctly and\r\nexpressly affirmed in that Constitution: therefore, if Congress shall\r\nundertake to say that a man's slave is no longer his slave when he crosses\r\na certain line into a Territory, that is depriving him of his property\r\nwithout due process of law, and is unconstitutional.\" There is the whole\r\nDred Scott decision. They add that if Congress cannot do so itself,\r\nCongress cannot confer any power to do so; and hence any effort by the\r\nTerritorial Legislature to do either of these things is absolutely decided\r\nagainst. It is a foregone conclusion by that court.\r\n\r\nNow, as to this indirect mode by \"unfriendly legislation,\" all lawyers\r\nhere will readily understand that such a proposition cannot be tolerated\r\nfor a moment, because a legislature cannot indirectly do that which it\r\ncannot accomplish directly. Then I say any legislation to control this\r\nproperty, as property, for its benefit as property, would be hailed by\r\nthis Dred Scott Supreme Court, and fully sustained; but any legislation\r\ndriving slave property out, or destroying it as property, directly or\r\nindirectly, will most assuredly, by that court, be held unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas says if the Constitution carries slavery into the\r\nTerritories, beyond the power of the people of the Territories to control\r\nit as other property; then it follows logically that every one who swears\r\nto support the Constitution of the United States must give that support\r\nto that property which it needs. And, if the Constitution carries slavery\r\ninto the Territories, beyond the power of the people, to control it as\r\nother property, then it also carries it into the States, because the\r\nConstitution is the supreme law of the land. Now, gentlemen, if it were\r\nnot for my excessive modesty, I would say that I told that very thing to\r\nJudge Douglas quite a year ago. This argument is here in print, and if it\r\nwere not for my modesty, as I said, I might call your attention to it. If\r\nyou read it, you will find that I not only made that argument, but made it\r\nbetter than he has made it since.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, this difference: I say now, and said then, there is no\r\nsort of question that the Supreme Court has decided that it is the right\r\nof the slave holder to take his slave and hold him in the Territory; and\r\nsaying this, judge Douglas himself admits the conclusion. He says if that\r\nis so, this consequence will follow; and because this consequence\r\nwould follow, his argument is, the decision cannot, therefore, be that\r\nway,--\"that would spoil my popular sovereignty; and it cannot be possible\r\nthat this great principle has been squelched out in this extraordinary\r\nway. It might be, if it were not for the extraordinary consequences of\r\nspoiling my humbug.\"\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the judge's argument about the Dred Scott case is,\r\nan effort to show that that decision deals altogether in declarations of\r\nnegatives; that the Constitution does not affirm anything as expounded\r\nby the Dred Scott decision, but it only declares a want of power a total\r\nabsence of power, in reference to the Territories. It seems to be his\r\npurpose to make the whole of that decision to result in a mere negative\r\ndeclaration of a want of power in Congress to do anything in relation to\r\nthis matter in the Territories. I know the opinion of the Judges states\r\nthat there is a total absence of power; but that is, unfortunately; not\r\nall it states: for the judges add that the right of property in a slave is\r\ndistinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution. It does not stop\r\nat saying that the right of property in a slave is recognized in the\r\nConstitution, is declared to exist somewhere in the Constitution, but says\r\nit is affirmed in the Constitution. Its language is equivalent to saying\r\nthat it is embodied and so woven in that instrument that it cannot be\r\ndetached without breaking the Constitution itself. In a word, it is part\r\nof the Constitution.\r\n\r\nDouglas is singularly unfortunate in his effort to make out that decision\r\nto be altogether negative, when the express language at the vital part is\r\nthat this is distinctly affirmed in the Constitution. I think myself, and\r\nI repeat it here, that this decision does not merely carry slavery into\r\nthe Territories, but by its logical conclusion it carries it into the\r\nStates in which we live. One provision of that Constitution is, that it\r\nshall be the supreme law of the land,--I do not quote the language,--any\r\nconstitution or law of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. This\r\nDred Scott decision says that the right of property in a slave is affirmed\r\nin that Constitution which is the supreme law of the land, any State\r\nconstitution or law notwithstanding. Then I say that to destroy a thing\r\nwhich is distinctly affirmed and supported by the supreme law of the land,\r\neven by a State constitution or law, is a violation of that supreme law,\r\nand there is no escape from it. In my judgment there is no avoiding that\r\nresult, save that the American people shall see that constitutions are\r\nbetter construed than our Constitution is construed in that decision. They\r\nmust take care that it is more faithfully and truly carried out than it is\r\nthere expounded.\r\n\r\nI must hasten to a conclusion. Near the beginning of my remarks I said\r\nthat this insidious Douglas popular sovereignty is the measure that now\r\nthreatens the purpose of the Republican party to prevent slavery from\r\nbeing nationalized in the United States. I propose to ask your attention\r\nfor a little while to some propositions in affirmance of that statement.\r\nTake it just as it stands, and apply it as a principle; extend and apply\r\nthat principle elsewhere; and consider where it will lead you. I now put\r\nthis proposition, that Judge Douglas's popular sovereignty applied will\r\nreopen the African slave trade; and I will demonstrate it by any variety\r\nof ways in which you can turn the subject or look at it.\r\n\r\nThe Judge says that the people of the Territories have the right, by his\r\nprinciple, to have slaves, if they want them. Then I say that the people\r\nin Georgia have the right to buy slaves in Africa, if they want them;\r\nand I defy any man on earth to show any distinction between the two\r\nthings,--to show that the one is either more wicked or more unlawful; to\r\nshow, on original principles, that one is better or worse than the other;\r\nor to show, by the Constitution, that one differs a whit from the other.\r\nHe will tell me, doubtless, that there is no constitutional provision\r\nagainst people taking slaves into the new Territories, and I tell him\r\nthat there is equally no constitutional provision against buying slaves\r\nin Africa. He will tell you that a people, in the exercise of popular\r\nsovereignty, ought to do as they please about that thing, and have slaves\r\nif they want them; and I tell you that the people of Georgia are as much\r\nentitled to popular sovereignty and to buy slaves in Africa, if they want\r\nthem, as the people of the Territory are to have slaves if they want them.\r\nI ask any man, dealing honestly with himself, to point out a distinction.\r\n\r\nI have recently seen a letter of Judge Douglas's in which, without stating\r\nthat to be the object, he doubtless endeavors to make a distinction\r\nbetween the two. He says he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of the\r\nlaws against the African slave trade. And why? He then seeks to give a\r\nreason that would not apply to his popular sovereignty in the Territories.\r\nWhat is that reason? \"The abolition of the African slave trade is a\r\ncompromise of the Constitution!\" I deny it. There is no truth in the\r\nproposition that the abolition of the African slave trade is a compromise\r\nof the Constitution. No man can put his finger on anything in the\r\nConstitution, or on the line of history, which shows it. It is a mere\r\nbarren assertion, made simply for the purpose of getting up a distinction\r\nbetween the revival of the African slave trade and his \"great principle.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time the Constitution of the United States was adopted, it was\r\nexpected that the slave trade would be abolished. I should assert and\r\ninsist upon that, if judge Douglas denied it. But I know that it was\r\nequally expected that slavery would be excluded from the Territories, and\r\nI can show by history that in regard to these two things public opinion\r\nwas exactly alike, while in regard to positive action, there was more done\r\nin the Ordinance of '87 to resist the spread of slavery than was ever done\r\nto abolish the foreign slave trade. Lest I be misunderstood, I say again\r\nthat at the time of the formation of the Constitution, public expectation\r\nwas that the slave trade would be abolished, but no more so than the\r\nspread of slavery in the Territories should be restrained. They stand\r\nalike, except that in the Ordinance of '87 there was a mark left by public\r\nopinion, showing that it was more committed against the spread of slavery\r\nin the Territories than against the foreign slave trade.\r\n\r\nCompromise! What word of compromise was there about it? Why, the public\r\nsense was then in favor of the abolition of the slave trade; but there was\r\nat the time a very great commercial interest involved in it, and extensive\r\ncapital in that branch of trade. There were doubtless the incipient stages\r\nof improvement in the South in the way of farming, dependent on the slave\r\ntrade, and they made a proposition to Congress to abolish the trade after\r\nallowing it twenty years,--a sufficient time for the capital and commerce\r\nengaged in it to be transferred to other channel. They made no provision\r\nthat it should be abolished in twenty years; I do not doubt that they\r\nexpected it would be, but they made no bargain about it. The public\r\nsentiment left no doubt in the minds of any that it would be done away.\r\nI repeat, there is nothing in the history of those times in favor of\r\nthat matter being a compromise of the constitution. It was the public\r\nexpectation at the time, manifested in a thousand ways, that the spread of\r\nslavery should also be restricted.\r\n\r\nThen I say, if this principle is established, that there is no wrong\r\nin slavery, and whoever wants it has a right to have it, is a matter\r\nof dollars and cents, a sort of question as to how they shall deal with\r\nbrutes, that between us and the negro here there is no sort of question,\r\nbut that at the South the question is between the negro and the crocodile,\r\nthat is all, it is a mere matter of policy, there is a perfect right,\r\naccording to interest, to do just as you please,--when this is done, where\r\nthis doctrine prevails, the miners and sappers will have formed public\r\nopinion for the slave trade. They will be ready for Jeff. Davis and\r\nStephens and other leaders of that company to sound the bugle for the\r\nrevival of the slave trade, for the second Dred Scott decision, for the\r\nflood of slavery to be poured over the free States, while we shall be here\r\ntied down and helpless and run over like sheep.\r\n\r\nIt is to be a part and parcel of this same idea to say to men who want to\r\nadhere to the Democratic party, who have always belonged to that\r\nparty, and are only looking about for some excuse to stick to it, but\r\nnevertheless hate slavery, that Douglas's popular sovereignty is as good\r\na way as any to oppose slavery. They allow themselves to be persuaded\r\neasily, in accordance with their previous dispositions, into this belief,\r\nthat it is about as good a way of opposing slavery as any, and we can do\r\nthat without straining our old party ties or breaking up old political\r\nassociations. We can do so without being called negro-worshipers. We\r\ncan do that without being subjected to the jibes and sneers that are so\r\nreadily thrown out in place of argument where no argument can be found.\r\nSo let us stick to this popular sovereignty,--this insidious popular\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nNow let me call your attention to one thing that has really happened,\r\nwhich shows this gradual and steady debauching of public opinion,\r\nthis course of preparation for the revival of the slave trade, for the\r\nTerritorial slave code, and the new Dred Scott decision that is to carry\r\nslavery into the Free States. Did you ever, five years ago, hear of\r\nanybody in the world saying that the negro had no share in the Declaration\r\nof National Independence; that it does not mean negroes at all; and when\r\n\"all men\" were spoken of, negroes were not included?\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that five years ago that proposition was not put upon paper\r\nby any living being anywhere. I have been unable at any time to find a man\r\nin an audience who would declare that he had ever known of anybody saying\r\nso five years ago. But last year there was not a Douglas popular sovereign\r\nin Illinois who did not say it. Is there one in Ohio but declares his firm\r\nbelief that the Declaration of Independence did not mean negroes at all? I\r\ndo not know how this is; I have not been here much; but I presume you are\r\nvery much alike everywhere. Then I suppose that all now express the belief\r\nthat the Declaration of Independence never did mean negroes. I call upon\r\none of them to say that he said it five years ago.\r\n\r\nIf you think that now, and did not think it then, the next thing that\r\nstrikes me is to remark that there has been a change wrought in you,--and\r\na very significant change it is, being no less than changing the negro,\r\nin your estimation, from the rank of a man to that of a brute. They\r\nare taking him down and placing him, when spoken of, among reptiles and\r\ncrocodiles, as Judge Douglas himself expresses it.\r\n\r\nIs not this change wrought in your minds a very important change? Public\r\nopinion in this country is everything. In a nation like ours, this popular\r\nsovereignty and squatter sovereignty have already wrought a change in the\r\npublic mind to the extent I have stated. There is no man in this crowd who\r\ncan contradict it.\r\n\r\nNow, if you are opposed to slavery honestly, as much as anybody, I ask you\r\nto note that fact, and the like of which is to follow, to be plastered on,\r\nlayer after layer, until very soon you are prepared to deal with the negro\r\nevery where as with the brute. If public sentiment has not been debauched\r\nalready to this point, a new turn of the screw in that direction is all\r\nthat is wanting; and this is constantly being done by the teachers of\r\nthis insidious popular sovereignty. You need but one or two turns further,\r\nuntil your minds, now ripening under these teachings, will be ready for\r\nall these things, and you will receive and support, or submit to, the\r\nslave trade, revived with all its horrors, a slave code enforced in our\r\nTerritories, and a new Dred Scott decision to bring slavery up into the\r\nvery heart of the free North. This, I must say, is but carrying out those\r\nwords prophetically spoken by Mr. Clay,--many, many years ago,--I believe\r\nmore than thirty years, when he told an audience that if they would\r\nrepress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation they must go\r\nback to the era of our independence, and muzzle the cannon which thundered\r\nits annual joyous return on the Fourth of July; they must blow out the\r\nmoral lights around us; they must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate\r\nthe love of liberty: but until they did these things, and others\r\neloquently enumerated by him, they could not repress all tendencies to\r\nultimate emancipation.\r\n\r\nI ask attention to the fact that in a pre-eminent degree these popular\r\nsovereigns are at this work: blowing out the moral lights around us;\r\nteaching that the negro is no longer a man, but a brute; that the\r\nDeclaration has nothing to do with him; that he ranks with the crocodile\r\nand the reptile; that man, with body and soul, is a matter of dollars and\r\ncents. I suggest to this portion of the Ohio Republicans, or Democrats, if\r\nthere be any present, the serious consideration of this fact that there\r\nis now going on among you a steady process of debauching public opinion on\r\nthis subject. With this, my friends, I bid you adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT CINCINNATI OHIO, SEPTEMBER 17, 1859\r\n\r\nMy Fellow-Citizens of the State of Ohio: This is the first time in my\r\nlife that I have appeared before an audience in so great a city as this:\r\nI therefore--though I am no longer a young man--make this appearance\r\nunder some degree of embarrassment. But I have found that when one is\r\nembarrassed, usually the shortest way to get through with it is to quit\r\ntalking or thinking about it, and go at something else.\r\n\r\nI understand that you have had recently with you my very distinguished\r\nfriend Judge Douglas, of Illinois; and I understand, without having had\r\nan opportunity (not greatly sought, to be sure) of seeing a report of the\r\nspeech that he made here, that he did me the honor to mention my humble\r\nname. I suppose that he did so for the purpose of making some objection to\r\nsome sentiment at some time expressed by me. I should expect, it is true,\r\nthat judge Douglas had reminded you, or informed you, if you had never\r\nbefore heard it, that I had once in my life declared it as my opinion that\r\nthis government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free; that\r\na house divided against itself cannot stand, and, as I had expressed it,\r\nI did not expect the house to fall, that I did not expect the Union to be\r\ndissolved, but that I did expect that it would cease to be divided, that\r\nit would become all one thing, or all the other; that either the opponents\r\nof slavery would arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the\r\npublic mind would rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction, or the friends of slavery will push it forward until it\r\nbecomes alike lawful in all the States, old or new, free as well as slave.\r\nI did, fifteen months ago, express that opinion, and upon many occasions\r\nJudge Douglas has denounced it, and has greatly, intentionally or\r\nunintentionally, misrepresented my purpose in the expression of that\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nI presume, without having seen a report of his speech, that he did\r\nso here. I presume that he alluded also to that opinion, in different\r\nlanguage, having been expressed at a subsequent time by Governor Seward of\r\nNew York, and that he took the two in a lump and denounced them; that he\r\ntried to point out that there was something couched in this opinion which\r\nled to the making of an entire uniformity of the local institutions of the\r\nvarious States of the Union, in utter disregard of the different States,\r\nwhich in their nature would seem to require a variety of institutions\r\nand a variety of laws, conforming to the differences in the nature of the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\nNot only so: I presume he insisted that this was a declaration of war\r\nbetween the free and slave States, that it was the sounding to the onset\r\nof continual war between the different States, the slave and free States.\r\n\r\nThis charge, in this form, was made by Judge Douglas on, I believe, the\r\n9th of July, 1858, in Chicago, in my hearing. On the next evening, I made\r\nsome reply to it. I informed him that many of the inferences he drew from\r\nthat expression of mine were altogether foreign to any purpose entertained\r\nby me, and in so far as he should ascribe these inferences to me, as my\r\npurpose, he was entirely mistaken; and in so far as he might argue that,\r\nwhatever might be my purpose, actions conforming to my views would lead\r\nto these results, he might argue and establish if he could; but, so far as\r\npurposes were concerned, he was totally mistaken as to me.\r\n\r\nWhen I made that reply to him, I told him, on the question of declaring\r\nwar between the different States of the Union, that I had not said that\r\nI did not expect any peace upon this question until slavery was\r\nexterminated; that I had only said I expected peace when that institution\r\nwas put where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in\r\ncourse of ultimate extinction; that I believed, from the organization of\r\nour government until a very recent period of time, the institution had\r\nbeen placed and continued upon such a basis; that we had had comparative\r\npeace upon that question through a portion of that period of time, only\r\nbecause the public mind rested in that belief in regard to it, and that\r\nwhen we returned to that position in relation to that matter, I supposed\r\nwe should again have peace as we previously had. I assured him, as I now,\r\nassure you, that I neither then had, nor have, or ever had, any purpose in\r\nany way of interfering with the institution of slavery, where it exists. I\r\nbelieve we have no power, under the Constitution of the United States, or\r\nrather under the form of government under which we live, to interfere with\r\nthe institution of slavery, or any other of the institutions of our\r\nsister States, be they free or slave States. I declared then, and I\r\nnow re-declare, that I have as little inclination to interfere with the\r\ninstitution of slavery where it now exists, through the instrumentality of\r\nthe General Government, or any other instrumentality, as I believe we have\r\nno power to do so. I accidentally used this expression: I had no purpose\r\nof entering into the slave States to disturb the institution of slavery.\r\nSo, upon the first occasion that Judge Douglas got an opportunity to reply\r\nto me, he passed by the whole body of what I had said upon that subject,\r\nand seized upon the particular expression of mine that I had no purpose of\r\nentering into the slave States to disturb the institution of slavery. \"Oh,\r\nno,\" said he, \"he [Lincoln] won't enter into the slave States to disturb\r\nthe institution of slavery, he is too prudent a man to do such a thing as\r\nthat; he only means that he will go on to the line between the free and\r\nslave States, and shoot over at them. This is all he means to do. He means\r\nto do them all the harm he can, to disturb them all he can, in such a way\r\nas to keep his own hide in perfect safety.\"\r\n\r\nWell, now, I did not think, at that time, that that was either a very\r\ndignified or very logical argument but so it was, I had to get along with\r\nit as well as I could.\r\n\r\nIt has occurred to-me here to-night that if I ever do shoot over the\r\nline at the people on the other side of the line into a slave State, and\r\npurpose to do so, keeping my skin safe, that I have now about the\r\nbest chance I shall ever have. I should not wonder if there are some\r\nKentuckians about this audience--we are close to Kentucky; and whether\r\nthat be so or not, we are on elevated ground, and, by speaking distinctly,\r\nI should not wonder if some of the Kentuckians would hear me on the other\r\nside of the river. For that reason I propose to address a portion of what\r\nI have to say to the Kentuckians.\r\n\r\nI say, then, in the first place, to the Kentuckians, that I am what they\r\ncall, as I understand it, a \"Black Republican.\" I think slavery is wrong,\r\nmorally and politically. I desire that it should be no further spread\r\nin--these United States, and I should not object if it should gradually\r\nterminate in the whole Union. While I say this for myself, I say to you\r\nKentuckians that I understand you differ radically with me upon this\r\nproposition; that you believe slavery is a good thing; that slavery is\r\nright; that it ought to be extended and perpetuated in this Union.\r\nNow, there being this broad difference between us, I do not pretend, in\r\naddressing myself to you Kentuckians, to attempt proselyting you; that\r\nwould be a vain effort. I do not enter upon it. I only propose to try\r\nto show you that you ought to nominate for the next Presidency, at\r\nCharleston, my distinguished friend Judge Douglas. In all that there is a\r\ndifference between you and him, I understand he is sincerely for you, and\r\nmore wisely for you than you are for yourselves. I will try to demonstrate\r\nthat proposition. Understand, now, I say that I believe he is as sincerely\r\nfor you, and more wisely for you, than you are for yourselves.\r\n\r\nWhat do you want more than anything else to make successful your views of\r\nslavery,--to advance the outspread of it, and to secure and perpetuate\r\nthe nationality of it? What do you want more than anything else? What--is\r\nneeded absolutely? What is indispensable to you? Why, if I may, be allowed\r\nto answer the question, it is to retain a hold upon the North, it is to\r\nretain support and strength from the free States. If you can get this\r\nsupport and strength from the free States, you can succeed. If you do not\r\nget this support and this strength from the free States, you are in the\r\nminority, and you are beaten at once.\r\n\r\nIf that proposition be admitted,--and it is undeniable,--then the next\r\nthing I say to you is, that Douglas, of all the men in this nation, is the\r\nonly man that affords you any hold upon the free States; that no other man\r\ncan give you any strength in the free States. This being so, if you doubt\r\nthe other branch of the proposition, whether he is for you--whether he is\r\nreally for you, as I have expressed it,--I propose asking your attention\r\nfor a while to a few facts.\r\n\r\nThe issue between you and me, understand, is, that I think slavery is\r\nwrong, and ought not to be outspread; and you think it is right, and\r\nought to be extended and perpetuated. [A voice, \"Oh, Lord!\"] That is my\r\nKentuckian I am talking to now.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to try to show you that Douglas is as sincerely for you and\r\nmore wisely for you than you are for yourselves.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we know that in a government like this, in a\r\ngovernment of the people, where the voice of all the men of the country,\r\nsubstantially, enters into the execution--or administration, rather--of\r\nthe government, in such a government, what lies at the bottom of all of it\r\nis public opinion. I lay down the proposition, that Judge Douglas is\r\nnot only the man that promises you in advance a hold upon the North, and\r\nsupport in the North, but he constantly moulds public opinion to your\r\nends; that in every possible way he can he constantly moulds the public\r\nopinion of the North to your ends; and if there are a few things in which\r\nhe seems to be against you,--a few things which he says that appear to\r\nbe against you, and a few that he forbears to say which you would like\r\nto have him say you ought to remember that the saying of the one, or the\r\nforbearing to say the other, would lose his hold upon the North, and, by\r\nconsequence, would lose his capacity to serve you.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject of moulding public opinion I call your attention to the\r\nfact--for a well established fact it is--that the Judge never says your\r\ninstitution of slavery is wrong. There is not a public man in the United\r\nStates, I believe, with the exception of Senator Douglas, who has not, at\r\nsome time in his life, declared his opinion whether the thing is right or\r\nwrong; but Senator Douglas never declares it is wrong. He leaves himself\r\nat perfect liberty to do all in your favor which he would be hindered from\r\ndoing if he were to declare the thing to be wrong. On the contrary, he\r\ntakes all the chances that he has for inveigling the sentiment of the\r\nNorth, opposed to slavery, into your support, by never saying it is right.\r\nThis you ought to set down to his credit: You ought to give him full\r\ncredit for this much; little though it be, in comparison to the whole\r\nwhich he does for you.\r\n\r\nSome other, things I will ask your attention to. He said upon the floor of\r\nthe United States Senate, and he has repeated it, as I understand, a great\r\nmany times, that he does not care whether slavery is \"voted up or voted\r\ndown.\" This again shows you, or ought to show you, if you would reason\r\nupon it, that he does not believe it to be wrong; for a man may say when\r\nhe sees nothing wrong in a thing; that he, dues not care whether it be\r\nvoted up or voted down but no man can logically say that he cares not\r\nwhether a thing goes up or goes down which to him appears to be wrong. You\r\ntherefore have a demonstration in this that to Judge Douglas's mind your\r\nfavorite institution, which you would have spread out and made perpetual,\r\nis no wrong.\r\n\r\nAnother thing he tells you, in a speech made at Memphis in Tennessee,\r\nshortly after the canvass in Illinois, last year. He there distinctly\r\ntold the people that there was a \"line drawn by the Almighty across this\r\ncontinent, on the one side of which the soil must always be cultivated by\r\nslaves\"; that he did not pretend to know exactly where that line was,\r\nbut that there was such a line. I want to ask your attention to that\r\nproposition again; that there is one portion of this continent where the\r\nAlmighty has signed the soil shall always be cultivated by slaves; that\r\nits being cultivated by slaves at that place is right; that it has the\r\ndirect sympathy and authority of the Almighty. Whenever you can get these\r\nNorthern audiences to adopt the opinion that slavery is right on the other\r\nside of the Ohio, whenever you can get them, in pursuance of Douglas's\r\nviews, to adopt that sentiment, they will very readily make the other\r\nargument, which is perfectly logical, that that which is right on that\r\nside of the Ohio cannot be wrong on this, and that if you have that\r\nproperty on that side of the Ohio, under the seal and stamp of the\r\nAlmighty, when by any means it escapes over here it is wrong to have\r\nconstitutions and laws \"to devil\" you about it. So Douglas is moulding the\r\npublic opinion of the North, first to say that the thing is right in your\r\nState over the Ohio River, and hence to say that that which is right there\r\nis not wrong here, and that all laws and constitutions here recognizing\r\nit as being wrong are themselves wrong, and ought to be repealed and\r\nabrogated. He will tell you, men of Ohio, that if you choose here to have\r\nlaws against slavery, it is in conformity to the idea that your climate\r\nis not suited to it, that your climate is not suited to slave labor, and\r\ntherefore you have constitutions and laws against it.\r\n\r\nLet us attend to that argument for a little while and see if it be sound.\r\nYou do not raise sugar-cane (except the new-fashioned sugar-cane, and you\r\nwon't raise that long), but they do raise it in Louisiana. You don't raise\r\nit in Ohio, because you can't raise it profitably, because the climate\r\ndon't suit it. They do raise it in Louisiana, because there it is\r\nprofitable. Now, Douglas will tell you that is precisely the slavery\r\nquestion: that they do have slaves there because they are profitable, and\r\nyou don't have them here because they are not profitable. If that is so,\r\nthen it leads to dealing with the one precisely as with the other. Is\r\nthere, then, anything in the constitution or laws of Ohio against raising\r\nsugar-cane? Have you found it necessary to put any such provision in your\r\nlaw? Surely not! No man desires to raise sugar-cane in Ohio, but if\r\nany man did desire to do so, you would say it was a tyrannical law that\r\nforbids his doing so; and whenever you shall agree with Douglas, whenever\r\nyour minds are brought to adopt his argument, as surely you will have\r\nreached the conclusion that although it is not profitable in Ohio, if any\r\nman wants it, is wrong to him not to let him have it.\r\n\r\nIn this matter Judge Douglas is preparing the public mind for you of\r\nKentucky to make perpetual that good thing in your estimation, about which\r\nyou and I differ.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, let me ask your attention to another thing. I believe\r\nit is safe to assert that five years ago no living man had expressed the\r\nopinion that the negro had no share in the Declaration of Independence.\r\nLet me state that again: five years ago no living man had expressed the\r\nopinion that the negro had no share in the Declaration of Independence.\r\nIf there is in this large audience any man who ever knew of that opinion\r\nbeing put upon paper as much as five years ago, I will be obliged to him\r\nnow or at a subsequent time to show it.\r\n\r\nIf that be true I wish you then to note the next fact: that within the\r\nspace of five years Senator Douglas, in the argument of this question, has\r\ngot his entire party, so far as I know, without exception, in saying that\r\nthe negro has no share in the Declaration of Independence. If there be now\r\nin all these United States one Douglas man that does not say this, I have\r\nbeen unable upon any occasion to scare him up. Now, if none of you said\r\nthis five years ago, and all of you say it now, that is a matter that you\r\nKentuckians ought to note. That is a vast change in the Northern public\r\nsentiment upon that question.\r\n\r\nOf what tendency is that change? The tendency of that change is to bring\r\nthe public mind to the conclusion that when men are spoken of, the\r\nnegro is not meant; that when negroes are spoken of, brutes alone are\r\ncontemplated. That change in public sentiment has already degraded\r\nthe black man in the estimation of Douglas and his followers from the\r\ncondition of a man of some sort, and assigned him to the condition of a\r\nbrute. Now, you Kentuckians ought to give Douglas credit for this. That is\r\nthe largest possible stride that can be made in regard to the perpetuation\r\nof your thing of slavery.\r\n\r\nA voice: Speak to Ohio men, and not to Kentuckians!\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN: I beg permission to speak as I please.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky perhaps, in many of the slave States certainly, you are trying\r\nto establish the rightfulness of slavery by reference to the Bible. You\r\nare trying to show that slavery existed in the Bible times by divine\r\nordinance. Now, Douglas is wiser than you, for your own benefit, upon that\r\nsubject. Douglas knows that whenever you establish that slavery was--right\r\nby the Bible, it will occur that that slavery was the slavery of the white\r\nman, of men without reference to color; and he knows very well that you\r\nmay entertain that idea in Kentucky as much as you please, but you will\r\nnever win any Northern support upon it. He makes a wiser argument for you:\r\nhe makes the argument that the slavery of the black man; the slavery of\r\nthe man who has a skin of a different color from your own, is right. He\r\nthereby brings to your support Northern voters who could not for a moment\r\nbe brought by your own argument of the Bible right of slavery. Will you\r\ngive him credit for that? Will you not say that in this matter he is more\r\nwisely for you than you are for yourselves?\r\n\r\nNow, having established with his entire party this doctrine, having been\r\nentirely successful in that branch of his efforts in your behalf, he is\r\nready for another.\r\n\r\nAt this same meeting at Memphis he declared that in all contests between\r\nthe negro and the white man he was for the white man, but that in all\r\nquestions between the negro and the crocodile he was for the negro. He did\r\nnot make that declaration accidentally at Memphis. He made it a great many\r\ntimes in the canvass in Illinois last year (though I don't know that it\r\nwas reported in any of his speeches there, but he frequently made it). I\r\nbelieve he repeated it at Columbus, and I should not wonder if he repeated\r\nit here. It is, then, a deliberate way of expressing himself upon that\r\nsubject. It is a matter of mature deliberation with him thus to express\r\nhimself upon that point of his case. It therefore requires deliberate\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe first inference seems to be that if you do not enslave the negro,\r\nyou are wronging the white man in some way or other, and that whoever is\r\nopposed to the negro being enslaved, is, in some way or other, against\r\nthe white man. Is not that a falsehood? If there was a necessary conflict\r\nbetween the white man and the negro, I should be for the white man as much\r\nas Judge Douglas; but I say there is no such necessary conflict. I say\r\nthat there is room enough for us all to be free, and that it not only does\r\nnot wrong the white man that the negro should be free, but it positively\r\nwrongs the mass of the white men that the negro should be enslaved; that\r\nthe mass of white men are really injured by the effects of slave labor in\r\nthe vicinity of the fields of their own labor.\r\n\r\nBut I do not desire to dwell upon this branch of the question more than to\r\nsay that this assumption of his is false, and I do hope that that fallacy\r\nwill not long prevail in the minds of intelligent white men. At all\r\nevents, you ought to thank Judge Douglas for it; it is for your benefit it\r\nis made.\r\n\r\nThe other branch of it is, that in the struggle between the negro and\r\nthe crocodile; he is for the negro. Well, I don't know that there is any\r\nstruggle between the negro and the crocodile, either. I suppose that if a\r\ncrocodile (or, as we old Ohio River boatmen used to call them, alligators)\r\nshould come across a white man, he would kill him if he could; and so he\r\nwould a negro. But what, at last, is this proposition? I believe it is a\r\nsort of proposition in proportion, which may be stated thus: \"As the negro\r\nis to the white man, so is the crocodile to the negro; and as the negro\r\nmay rightfully treat the crocodile as a beast or reptile, so the white man\r\nmay rightfully treat the negro as a beast or a reptile.\" That is really\r\nthe \"knip\" of all that argument of his.\r\n\r\nNow, my brother Kentuckians, who believe in this, you ought to thank\r\nJudge Douglas for having put that in a much more taking way than any of\r\nyourselves have done.\r\n\r\nAgain, Douglas's great principle, \"popular sovereignty,\" as he calls it,\r\ngives you, by natural consequence, the revival of the slave trade whenever\r\nyou want it. If you question this, listen awhile, consider awhile what I\r\nshall advance in support of that proposition.\r\n\r\nHe says that it is the sacred right of the man who goes into the\r\nTerritories to have slavery if he wants it. Grant that for argument's\r\nsake. Is it not the sacred right of the man who don't go there equally to\r\nbuy slaves in Africa, if he wants them? Can you point out the difference?\r\nThe man who goes into the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska, or any other\r\nnew Territory, with the sacred right of taking a slave there which belongs\r\nto him, would certainly have no more right to take one there than I would,\r\nwho own no slave, but who would desire to buy one and take him there. You\r\nwill not say you, the friends of Judge Douglas but that the man who\r\ndoes not own a slave has an equal right to buy one and take him to the\r\nTerritory as the other does.\r\n\r\nA voice: I want to ask a question. Don't foreign nations interfere with\r\nthe slave trade?\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN: Well! I understand it to be a principle of Democracy to whip\r\nforeign nations whenever, they interfere with us.\r\n\r\nVoice: I only asked for information. I am a Republican myself.\r\n\r\nMr. LINCOLN: You and I will be on the best terms in the world, but I do\r\nnot wish to be diverted from the point I was trying to press.\r\n\r\nI say that Douglas's popular sovereignty, establishing his sacred right\r\nin the people, if you please, if carried to its logical conclusion gives\r\nequally the sacred right to the people of the States or the Territories\r\nthemselves to buy slaves wherever they can buy them cheapest; and if any\r\nman can show a distinction, I should like to hear him try it. If any man\r\ncan show how the people of Kansas have a better right to slaves, because\r\nthey want them, than the people of Georgia have to buy them in Africa,\r\nI want him to do it. I think it cannot be done. If it is \"popular\r\nsovereignty\" for the people to have slaves because they want them, it is\r\npopular sovereignty for them to buy them in Africa because they desire to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nI know that Douglas has recently made a little effort, not seeming to\r\nnotice that he had a different theory, has made an effort to get rid\r\nof that. He has written a letter, addressed to somebody, I believe, who\r\nresides in Iowa, declaring his opposition to the repeal of the laws that\r\nprohibit the Africa slave trade. He bases his opposition to such repeal\r\nupon the ground that these laws are themselves one of the compromises of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States. Now, it would be very interesting\r\nto see Judge Douglas or any of his friends turn, to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States and point out that compromise, to show where there is\r\nany compromise in the Constitution, or provision in the Constitution;\r\nexpress or implied, by which the administrators of that Constitution are\r\nunder any obligation to repeal the African slave trade. I know, or at\r\nleast I think I know, that the framers of that Constitution did expect\r\nthe African slave trade would be abolished at the end of twenty years, to\r\nwhich time their prohibition against its being abolished extended there\r\nis abundant contemporaneous history to show that the framers of the\r\nConstitution expected it to be abolished. But while they so expected,\r\nthey gave nothing for that expectation, and they put no provision in\r\nthe Constitution requiring it should be so abolished. The migration or\r\nimportation of such persons as the States shall see fit to admit shall not\r\nbe prohibited, but a certain tax might be levied upon such importation.\r\nBut what was to be done after that time? The Constitution is as silent\r\nabout that as it is silent, personally, about myself. There is absolutely\r\nnothing in it about that subject; there is only the expectation of the\r\nframers of the Constitution that the slave trade would be abolished at the\r\nend of that time; and they expected it would be abolished, owing to public\r\nsentiment, before that time; and the put that provision in, in order that\r\nit should not be abolished before that time, for reasons which I suppose\r\nthey thought to be sound ones, but which I will not now try to enumerate\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nBut while, they expected the slave trade would be abolished at that time,\r\nthey expected that the spread of slavery into the new Territories should\r\nalso be restricted. It is as easy to prove that the framers of the\r\nConstitution of the United States expected that slavery should be\r\nprohibited from extending into the new Territories, as it is to prove\r\nthat it was expected that the slave trade should be abolished. Both these\r\nthings were expected. One was no more expected than the other, and one was\r\nno more a compromise of the Constitution than the other. There was nothing\r\nsaid in the Constitution in regard to the spread of slavery into the\r\nTerritory. I grant that; but there was something very important said about\r\nit by the same generation of men in the adoption of the old Ordinance of\r\n'87, through the influence of which you here in Ohio, our neighbors in\r\nIndiana, we in Illinois, our neighbors in Michigan and Wisconsin, are\r\nhappy, prosperous, teeming millions of free men. That generation of men,\r\nthough not to the full extent members of the convention that framed the\r\nConstitution, were to some extent members of that convention, holding\r\nseats at the same time in one body and the other, so that if there was any\r\ncompromise on either of these subjects, the strong evidence is that\r\nthat compromise was in favor of the restriction of slavery from the new\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nBut Douglas says that he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of those\r\nlaws because, in his view, it is a compromise of the Constitution. You\r\nKentuckians, no doubt, are somewhat offended with that. You ought not to\r\nbe! You ought to be patient! You ought to know that if he said less than\r\nthat, he would lose the power of \"lugging\" the Northern States to your\r\nsupport. Really, what you would push him to do would take from him\r\nhis entire power to serve you. And you ought to remember how long, by\r\nprecedent, Judge Douglas holds himself obliged to stick by compromises.\r\nYou ought to remember that by the time you yourselves think you are ready\r\nto inaugurate measures for the revival of the African slave trade, that\r\nsufficient time will have arrived, by precedent, for Judge Douglas to\r\nbreak through, that compromise. He says now nothing more strong than\r\nhe said in 1849 when he declared in favor of Missouri Compromise,--and\r\nprecisely four years and a quarter after he declared that Compromise to\r\nbe a sacred thing, which \"no ruthless hand would ever daze to touch,\" he\r\nhimself brought forward the measure ruthlessly to destroy it. By a mere\r\ncalculation of time it will only be four years more until he is ready to\r\ntake back his profession about the sacredness of the Compromise abolishing\r\nthe slave trade. Precisely as soon as you are ready to have his services\r\nin that direction, by fair calculation, you may be sure of having them.\r\n\r\nBut you remember and set down to Judge Douglas's debt, or discredit, that\r\nhe, last year, said the people of Territories can, in spite of the Dred\r\nScott decision, exclude your slaves from those Territories; that he\r\ndeclared, by \"unfriendly legislation\" the extension of your property into\r\nthe new Territories may be cut off, in the teeth of the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nHe assumed that position at Freeport on the 27th of August, 1858. He said\r\nthat the people of the Territories can exclude slavery, in so many words:\r\nYou ought, however, to bear in mind that he has never said it since. You\r\nmay hunt in every speech that he has since made, and he has never used\r\nthat expression once. He has never seemed to notice that he is stating his\r\nviews differently from what he did then; but by some sort of accident, he\r\nhas always really stated it differently. He has always since then declared\r\nthat \"the Constitution does not carry slavery into the Territories of the\r\nUnited States beyond the power of the people legally to control it, as\r\nother property.\" Now, there is a difference in the language used upon\r\nthat former occasion and in this latter day. There may or may not be a\r\ndifference in the meaning, but it is worth while considering whether there\r\nis not also a difference in meaning.\r\n\r\nWhat is it to exclude? Why, it is to drive it out. It is in some way to\r\nput it out of the Territory. It is to force it across the line, or change\r\nits character so that, as property, it is out of existence. But what is\r\nthe controlling of it \"as other property\"? Is controlling it as other\r\nproperty the same thing as destroying it, or driving it away? I should\r\nthink not. I should think the controlling of it as other property would be\r\njust about what you in Kentucky should want. I understand the controlling\r\nof property means the controlling of it for the benefit of the owner of\r\nit. While I have no doubt the Supreme Court of the United States would\r\nsay \"God speed\" to any of the Territorial Legislatures that should thus\r\ncontrol slave property, they would sing quite a different tune if, by\r\nthe pretence of controlling it, they were to undertake to pass laws which\r\nvirtually excluded it,--and that upon a very well known principle to\r\nall lawyers, that what a Legislature cannot directly do, it cannot do by\r\nindirection; that as the Legislature has not the power to drive slaves\r\nout, they have no power, by indirection, by tax, or by imposing burdens in\r\nany way on that property, to effect the same end, and that any attempt to\r\ndo so would be held by the Dred Scott court unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nDouglas is not willing to stand by his first proposition that they can\r\nexclude it, because we have seen that that proposition amounts to nothing\r\nmore nor less than the naked absurdity that you may lawfully drive out\r\nthat which has a lawful right to remain. He admitted at first that the\r\nslave might be lawfully taken into the Territories under the Constitution\r\nof the United States, and yet asserted that he might be lawfully driven\r\nout. That being the proposition, it is the absurdity I have stated. He\r\nis not willing to stand in the face of that direct, naked, and impudent\r\nabsurdity; he has, therefore, modified his language into that of being\r\n\"controlled as other property.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kentuckians don't like this in Douglas! I will tell you where it will\r\ngo. He now swears by the court. He was once a leading man in Illinois to\r\nbreak down a court, because it had made a decision he did not like. But\r\nhe now not only swears by the court, the courts having got to working\r\nfor you, but he denounces all men that do not swear by the courts,\r\nas unpatriotic, as bad citizens. When one of these acts of unfriendly\r\nlegislation shall impose such heavy burdens as to, in effect, destroy\r\nproperty in slaves in a Territory, and show plainly enough that there\r\ncan be no mistake in the purpose of the Legislature to make them\r\nso burdensome, this same Supreme Court will decide that law to be\r\nunconstitutional, and he will be ready to say for your benefit \"I swear by\r\nthe court; I give it up\"; and while that is going on he has been getting\r\nall his men to swear by the courts, and to give it up with him. In this\r\nagain he serves you faithfully, and, as I say, more wisely than you serve\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\nAgain: I have alluded in the beginning of these remarks to the fact that\r\nJudge Douglas has made great complaint of my having expressed the opinion\r\nthat this government \"cannot endure permanently, half slave and half\r\nfree.\" He has complained of Seward for using different language, and\r\ndeclaring that there is an \"irrepressible conflict\" between the principles\r\nof free and slave labor. [A voice: \"He says it is not original with\r\nSeward. That it is original with Lincoln.\"] I will attend to that\r\nimmediately, sir. Since that time, Hickman of Pennsylvania expressed the\r\nsame sentiment. He has never denounced Mr. Hickman: why? There is a little\r\nchance, notwithstanding that opinion in the mouth of Hickman, that he may\r\nyet be a Douglas man. That is the difference! It is not unpatriotic to\r\nhold that opinion if a man is a Douglas man.\r\n\r\nBut neither I, nor Seward, nor Hickman is entitled to the enviable or\r\nunenviable distinction of having first expressed that idea. That same idea\r\nwas expressed by the Richmond Enquirer, in Virginia, in 1856,--quite two\r\nyears before it was expressed by the first of us. And while Douglas was\r\npluming himself that in his conflict with my humble self, last year, he\r\nhad \"squelched out\" that fatal heresy, as he delighted to call it, and\r\nhad suggested that if he only had had a chance to be in New York and meet\r\nSeward he would have \"squelched\" it there also, it never occurred to him\r\nto breathe a word against Pryor. I don't think that you can discover that\r\nDouglas ever talked of going to Virginia to \"squelch\" out that idea there.\r\nNo. More than that. That same Roger A. Pryor was brought to Washington\r\nCity and made the editor of the par excellence Douglas paper, after making\r\nuse of that expression, which, in us, is so unpatriotic and heretical.\r\nFrom all this, my Kentucky friends may see that this opinion is heretical\r\nin his view only when it is expressed by men suspected of a desire that\r\nthe country shall all become free, and not when expressed by those fairly\r\nknown to entertain the desire that the whole country shall become slave.\r\nWhen expressed by that class of men, it is in nowise offensive to him. In\r\nthis again, my friends of Kentucky, you have Judge Douglas with you.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason why you Southern people ought to nominate Douglas\r\nat your convention at Charleston. That reason is the wonderful capacity of\r\nthe man,--the power he has of doing what would seem to be impossible. Let\r\nme call your attention to one of these apparently impossible things:\r\n\r\nDouglas had three or four very distinguished men of the most extreme\r\nanti-slavery views of any men in the Republican party expressing their\r\ndesire for his re-election to the Senate last year. That would, of itself,\r\nhave seemed to be a little wonderful; but that wonder is heightened when\r\nwe see that Wise of Virginia, a man exactly opposed to them, a man who\r\nbelieves in the divine right of slavery, was also expressing his desire\r\nthat Douglas should be reelected; that another man that may be said to\r\nbe kindred to Wise, Mr. Breckinridge, the Vice-President, and of your\r\nown State, was also agreeing with the anti-slavery men in the North that\r\nDouglas ought to be re-elected. Still to heighten the wonder, a senator\r\nfrom Kentucky, whom I have always loved with an affection as tender\r\nand endearing as I have ever loved any man, who was opposed to the\r\nanti-slavery men for reasons which seemed sufficient to him, and equally\r\nopposed to Wise and Breckinridge, was writing letters into Illinois to\r\nsecure the reelection of Douglas. Now, that all these conflicting elements\r\nshould be brought, while at daggers' points with one another, to support\r\nhim, is a feat that is worthy for you to note and consider. It is quite\r\nprobable that each of these classes of men thought, by the re-election of\r\nDouglas, their peculiar views would gain something: it is probable that\r\nthe anti-slavery men thought their views would gain something; that Wise\r\nand Breckinridge thought so too, as regards their opinions; that Mr.\r\nCrittenden thought that his views would gain something, although he was\r\nopposed to both these other men. It is probable that each and all of them\r\nthought that they were using Douglas; and it is yet an unsolved problem\r\nwhether he was not using them all. If he was, then it is for you to\r\nconsider whether that power to perform wonders is one for you lightly to\r\nthrow away.\r\n\r\nThere is one other thing that I will say to you, in this relation. It is\r\nbut my opinion, I give it to you without a fee. It is my opinion that it\r\nis for you to take him or be defeated; and that if you do take him you\r\nmay be beaten. You will surely be beaten if you do not take him. We, the\r\nRepublicans and others forming the opposition of the country, intend to\r\n\"stand by our guns,\" to be patient and firm, and in the long run to beat\r\nyou, whether you take him or not. We know that before we fairly beat\r\nyou we have to beat you both together. We know that you are \"all of a\r\nfeather,\" and that we have to beat you all together, and we expect to\r\ndo it. We don't intend to be very impatient about it. We mean to be as\r\ndeliberate and calm about it as it is possible to be, but as firm and\r\nresolved as it is possible for men to be. When we do as we say,--beat\r\nyou,--you perhaps want to know what we will do with you.\r\n\r\nI will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the opposition,\r\nwhat we mean to do with you. We mean to treat you, as near as we possibly\r\ncan, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison treated you. We mean to leave\r\nyou alone, and in no way interfere with your institution; to abide by all\r\nand every compromise of the Constitution, and, in a word, coming back to\r\nthe original proposition, to treat you, so far as degenerated men (if we\r\nhave degenerated) may, according to the examples of those noble fathers,\r\nWashington, Jefferson, and Madison. We mean to remember that you are\r\nas good as we; that there is no difference between us other than the\r\ndifference of circumstances. We mean to recognize and bear in mind always\r\nthat you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as we\r\nclaim to have, and treat you accordingly. We mean to marry your girls when\r\nwe have a chance, the white ones I mean; and I have the honor to inform\r\nyou that I once did have a chance in that way.\r\n\r\nI have told you what we mean to do. I want to know, now, when that thing\r\ntakes place, what do you mean to do? I often hear it intimated that you\r\nmean to divide the Union whenever a Republican, or anything like it, is\r\nelected President of the United States. [A voice: \"That is so.\"] \"That is\r\nso,\" one of them says; I wonder if he is a Kentuckian? [A voice: \"He is\r\na Douglas man.\"] Well, then, I want to know what you are going to do with\r\nyour half of it? Are you going to split the Ohio down through, and push\r\nyour half off a piece? Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us\r\noutrageous fellows? Or are you going to build up a wall some way between\r\nyour country and ours, by which that movable property of yours can't come\r\nover here any more, to the danger of your losing it? Do you think you can\r\nbetter yourselves, on that subject, by leaving us here under no obligation\r\nwhatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come\r\nhither? You have divided the Union because we would not do right with you,\r\nas you think, upon that subject; when we cease to be under obligations to\r\ndo anything for you, how much better off do you think you will be? Will\r\nyou make war upon us and kill us all? Why, gentlemen, I think you are as\r\ngallant and as brave men as live; that you can fight as bravely in a\r\ngood cause, man for man, as any other people living; that you have shown\r\nyourselves capable of this upon various occasions: but, man for man, you\r\nare not better than we are, and there are not so many of you as there are\r\nof us. You will never make much of a hand at whipping us. If we were fewer\r\nin numbers than you, I think that you could whip us; if we were equal, it\r\nwould likely be a drawn battle; but being inferior in numbers, you will\r\nmake nothing by attempting to master us.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps I have addressed myself as long, or longer, to the Kentuckians\r\nthan I ought to have done, inasmuch as I have said that whatever course\r\nyou take we intend in the end to beat you. I propose to address a few\r\nremarks to our friends, by way of discussing with them the best means of\r\nkeeping that promise that I have in good faith made.\r\n\r\nIt may appear a little episodical for me to mention the topic of which\r\nI will speak now. It is a favorite position of Douglas's that the\r\ninterference of the General Government, through the Ordinance of '87, or\r\nthrough any other act of the General Government never has made or ever can\r\nmake a free State; the Ordinance of '87 did not make free States of\r\nOhio, Indiana, or Illinois; that these States are free upon his \"great\r\nprinciple\" of popular sovereignty, because the people of those several\r\nStates have chosen to make them so. At Columbus, and probably here, he\r\nundertook to compliment the people that they themselves have made the\r\nState of Ohio free, and that the Ordinance of '87 was not entitled in any\r\ndegree to divide the honor with them. I have no doubt that the people\r\nof the State of Ohio did make her free according to their own will and\r\njudgment, but let the facts be remembered.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, I believe, it was you who made your first constitution, with\r\nthe clause prohibiting slavery, and you did it, I suppose, very nearly\r\nunanimously; but you should bear in mind that you--speaking of you as\r\none people--that you did so unembarrassed by the actual presence of\r\nthe institution amongst you; that you made it a free State not with the\r\nembarrassment upon you of already having among you many slaves, which if\r\nthey had been here, and you had sought to make a free State, you would\r\nnot know what to do with. If they had been among you, embarrassing\r\ndifficulties, most probably, would have induced you to tolerate a slave\r\nconstitution instead of a free one, as indeed these very difficulties have\r\nconstrained every people on this continent who have adopted slavery.\r\n\r\nPray what was it that made you free? What kept you free? Did you not\r\nfind your country free when you came to decide that Ohio should be a free\r\nState? It is important to inquire by what reason you found it so. Let us\r\ntake an illustration between the States of Ohio and Kentucky. Kentucky is\r\nseparated by this River Ohio, not a mile wide. A portion of Kentucky, by\r\nreason of the course of the Ohio, is farther north than this portion of\r\nOhio, in which we now stand. Kentucky is entirely covered with slavery;\r\nOhio is entirely free from it: What made that difference? Was it climate?\r\nNo. A portion of Kentucky was farther north than this portion of Ohio.\r\nWas it soil? No. There is nothing in the soil of the one more favorable\r\nto slave than the other. It was not climate or soil that mused one side of\r\nthe line to be entirely covered with slavery, and the other side free of\r\nit. What was it? Study over it. Tell us, if you can, in all the range\r\nof conjecture, if there be anything you can conceive of that made that\r\ndifference, other than that there was no law of any sort keeping it out of\r\nKentucky, while the Ordinance of '87 kept it out of Ohio. If there is any\r\nother reason than this, I confess that it is wholly beyond my power to\r\nconceive of it. This, then, I offer to combat the idea that that Ordinance\r\nhas never made any State free.\r\n\r\nI don't stop at this illustration. I come to the State of Indiana; and\r\nwhat I have said as between Kentucky and Ohio, I repeat as between\r\nIndiana and Kentucky: it is equally applicable. One additional argument\r\nis applicable also to Indiana. In her Territorial condition she more than\r\nonce petitioned Congress to abrogate the Ordinance entirely, or at least\r\nso far as to suspend its operation for a time, in order that they should\r\nexercise the \"popular sovereignty\" of having slaves if they wanted them.\r\nThe men then controlling the General Government, imitating the men of the\r\nRevolution, refused Indiana that privilege. And so we have the evidence\r\nthat Indiana supposed she could have slaves, if it were not for that\r\nOrdinance; that she besought Congress to put that barrier out of the way;\r\nthat Congress refused to do so; and it all ended at last in Indiana being\r\na free State. Tell me not then that the Ordinance of '87 had nothing to do\r\nwith making Indiana a free State, when we find some men chafing against,\r\nand only restrained by, that barrier.\r\n\r\nCome down again to our State of Illinois. The great Northwest Territory,\r\nincluding Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, was acquired\r\nfirst, I believe, by the British Government, in part at least, from the\r\nFrench. Before the establishment of our independence it became a part\r\nof Virginia, enabling Virginia afterward to transfer it to the General\r\nGovernment. There were French settlements in what is now Illinois, and at\r\nthe same time there were French settlements in what is now Missouri, in\r\nthe tract of country that was not purchased till about 1803. In these\r\nFrench settlements negro slavery had existed for many years, perhaps more\r\nthan a hundred; if not as much as two hundred years,--at Kaskaskia, in\r\nIllinois, and at St. Genevieve, or Cape Girardeau, perhaps, in Missouri.\r\nThe number of slaves was not very great, but there was about the same\r\nnumber in each place. They were there when we acquired the Territory.\r\nThere was no effort made to break up the relation of master and slave, and\r\neven the Ordinance of 1787 was not so enforced as to destroy that slavery\r\nin Illinois; nor did the Ordinance apply to Missouri at all.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to ask your attention to; at this point, is that Illinois and\r\nMissouri came into the Union about the same time, Illinois in the latter\r\npart of 1818, and Missouri, after a struggle, I believe sometime in 1820.\r\nThey had been filling up with American people about the same period of\r\ntime; their progress enabling them to come into the Union about the same\r\ntime. At the end of that ten years, in which they had been so preparing\r\n(for it was about that period of time), the number of slaves in Illinois\r\nhad actually decreased; while in Missouri, beginning with very few, at the\r\nend of that ten years there were about ten thousand. This being so, and it\r\nbeing remembered that Missouri and Illinois are, to a certain extent, in\r\nthe same parallel of latitude, that the northern half of Missouri and the\r\nsouthern half of Illinois are in the same parallel of latitude, so that\r\nclimate would have the same effect upon one as upon the other, and that in\r\nthe soil there is no material difference so far as bears upon the question\r\nof slavery being settled upon one or the other,--there being none of those\r\nnatural causes to produce a difference in filling them, and yet there\r\nbeing a broad difference to their filling up, we are led again to inquire\r\nwhat was the cause of that difference.\r\n\r\nIt is most natural to say that in Missouri there was no law to keep that\r\ncountry from filling up with slaves, while in Illinois there was the\r\nOrdinance of The Ordinance being there, slavery decreased during that ten\r\nyears; the Ordinance not being in the other, it increased from a few to\r\nten thousand. Can anybody doubt the reason of the difference?\r\n\r\nI think all these facts most abundantly prove that my friend Judge\r\nDouglas's proposition, that the Ordinance of '87, or the national\r\nrestriction of slavery, never had a tendency to make a free State, is a\r\nfallacy,--a proposition without the shadow or substance of truth about it.\r\n\r\nDouglas sometimes says that all the States (and it is part of this same\r\nproposition I have been discussing) that have become free have become so\r\nupon his \"great principle\"; that the State of Illinois itself came\r\ninto the Union as a slave State, and that the people, upon the \"great\r\nprinciple\" of popular sovereignty, have since made it a free State. Allow\r\nme but a little while to state to you what facts there are to justify him\r\nin saying that Illinois came into the Union as a slave State.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned to you that there were a few old French slaves there.\r\nThey numbered, I think, one or two hundred. Besides that, there had been\r\na Territorial law for indenturing black persons. Under that law, in\r\nviolation of the Ordinance of '87, but without any enforcement of the\r\nOrdinance to overthrow the system, there had been a small number of\r\nslaves introduced as indentured persons. Owing to this, the clause for\r\nthe prohibition of slavery was slightly modified. Instead of running like\r\nyours, that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except for crime,\r\nof which the party shall have been duly convicted, should exist in the\r\nState, they said that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude should\r\nthereafter be introduced; and that the children of indentured servants\r\nshould be born free; and nothing was said about the few old French slaves.\r\nOut of this fact, that the clause for prohibiting slavery was modified\r\nbecause of the actual presence of it, Douglas asserts again and again that\r\nIllinois came into the Union as a slave State. How far the facts sustain\r\nthe conclusion that he draws, it is for intelligent and impartial men\r\nto decide. I leave it with you, with these remarks, worthy of being\r\nremembered, that that little thing, those few indentured servants being\r\nthere, was of itself sufficient to modify a constitution made by a people\r\nardently desiring to have a free constitution; showing the power of the\r\nactual presence of the institution of slavery to prevent any people,\r\nhowever anxious to make a free State, from making it perfectly so.\r\n\r\nI have been detaining you longer, perhaps, than I ought to do.\r\n\r\nI am in some doubt whether to introduce another topic upon which I could\r\ntalk a while. [Cries of \"Go on,\" and \"Give us it.\"] It is this, then:\r\nDouglas's Popular sovereignty, as a principle, is simply this: If one man\r\nchooses to make a slave of another man, neither that man nor anybody else\r\nhas a right to object. Apply it to government, as he seeks to apply\r\nit, and it is this: If, in a new Territory into which a few people are\r\nbeginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes, they choose\r\nto either exclude slavery from their limits, or to establish it there,\r\nhowever one or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved, or the\r\ninfinitely greater number of persons who are afterward to inhabit that\r\nTerritory, or the other members of the family of communities of which they\r\nare but an incipient member, or the general head of the family of States\r\nas parent of all, however their action may affect one or the other of\r\nthese, there is no power or right to interfere. That is Douglas's popular\r\nsovereignty applied. Now, I think that there is a real popular sovereignty\r\nin the world. I think the definition of popular sovereignty, in the\r\nabstract, would be about this: that each man shall do precisely as he\r\npleases with himself, and with all those things which exclusively concern\r\nhim. Applied in government, this principle would be that a general\r\ngovernment shall do all those things which pertain to it, and all the\r\nlocal governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those\r\nmatters which exclusively concern them.\r\n\r\nDouglas looks upon slavery as so insignificant that the people must decide\r\nthat question for themselves; and yet they are not fit to decide who\r\nshall be their governor, judge, or secretary, or who shall be any of\r\ntheir officers. These are vast national matters in his estimation; but the\r\nlittle matter in his estimation is that of planting slavery there. That\r\nis purely of local interest, which nobody should be allowed to say a word\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nLabor is the great source from which nearly all, if not all, human\r\ncomforts and necessities are drawn. There is a difference in opinion about\r\nthe elements of labor in society. Some men assume that there is necessary\r\nconnection between capital and labor, and that connection draws within\r\nit the whole of the labor of the community. They assume that nobody works\r\nunless capital excites them to work. They begin next to consider what is\r\nthe best way. They say there are but two ways: one is to hire men, and to\r\nallure them to labor by their consent; the other is to buy the men, and\r\ndrive them, to it, and that is slavery. Having assumed that, they proceed\r\nto discuss the question of whether the laborers themselves are better off\r\nin the condition of slaves or of hired laborers, and they usually decide\r\nthat they are better off in the condition of slaves.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I say that the whole thing is a mistake. That there is\r\na certain relation between capital and labor, I admit. That it does exist,\r\nand rightfully exists, I think is true. That men who are industrious, and\r\nsober, and honest in the pursuit of their own interests should after a\r\nwhile accumulate capital, and after that should be allowed to enjoy it in\r\npeace, and also, if they should choose, when they have accumulated it,\r\nto use it to save themselves from actual labor, and hire other people\r\nto labor for them, is right. In doing so they do not wrong the man they\r\nemploy, for they find men who have not of their own land to work upon,\r\nor shops to work in, and who are benefited by working for others, hired\r\nlaborers, receiving their capital for it. Thus a few men, that own\r\ncapital, hire a few others, and these establish the relation of capital\r\nand labor rightfully, a relation of which I make no complaint. But I\r\ninsist that that relation, after all, does not embrace more than one\r\neighth of the labor of the country.\r\n\r\n[The speaker proceeded to argue that the hired laborer, with his ability\r\nto become an employer, must have every precedence over him who labors\r\nunder the inducement of force. He continued:]\r\n\r\nI have taken upon myself in the name of some of you to say that we expect\r\nupon these principles to ultimately beat them. In order to do so, I think\r\nwe want and must have a national policy in regard to the institution of\r\nslavery that acknowledges and deals with that institution as being\r\nwrong. Whoever desires the prevention of the spread of slavery and the\r\nnationalization of that institution yields all when he yields to any\r\npolicy that either recognizes slavery as being right or as being an\r\nindifferent thing. Nothing will make you successful but setting up a\r\npolicy which shall treat the thing as being wrong: When I say this, I do\r\nnot mean to say that this General Government is charged with the duty of\r\nredressing or preventing all the wrongs in the world, but I do think that\r\nit is charged with preventing and redressing all wrongs which are wrongs\r\nto itself. This Government is expressly charged with the duty of providing\r\nfor the general welfare. We believe that the spreading out and\r\nperpetuity of the institution of slavery impairs the general welfare.\r\nWe believe--nay, we know--that that is the only thing that has ever\r\nthreatened the perpetuity of the Union itself. The only thing which has\r\never menaced the destruction of the government under which we live is this\r\nvery thing. To repress this thing, we think, is, Providing for the general\r\nwelfare. Our friends in Kentucky differ from us. We need not make our\r\nargument for them, but we who think it is wrong in all its relations, or\r\nin some of them at least, must decide as to our own actions and our own\r\ncourse, upon our own judgment.\r\n\r\nI say that we must not interfere with the institution of slavery in the\r\nStates where it exists, because the Constitution forbids it, and the\r\ngeneral welfare does not require us to do so. We must not withhold an\r\nefficient Fugitive Slave law, because the Constitution requires us, as\r\nI understand it, not to withhold such a law. But we must prevent the\r\noutspreading of the institution, because neither the Constitution nor\r\ngeneral welfare requires us to extend it. We must prevent the revival of\r\nthe African slave trade, and the enacting by Congress of a Territorial\r\nslave code. We must prevent each of these things being done by either\r\nCongresses or courts. The people of these United States are the rightful\r\nmasters of both Congresses and courts, not to overthrow the Constitution,\r\nbut to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.\r\n\r\nTo do these things we must employ instrumentalities. We must hold\r\nconventions; we must adopt platforms, if we conform to ordinary custom;\r\nwe must nominate candidates; and we must carry elections. In all these\r\nthings, I think that we ought to keep in view our real purpose, and in\r\nnone do anything that stands adverse to our purpose. If we shall adopt a\r\nplatform that fails to recognize or express our purpose, or elect a man\r\nthat declares himself inimical to our purpose, we not only take nothing by\r\nour success, but we tacitly admit that we act upon no other principle\r\nthan a desire to have \"the loaves and fishes,\" by which, in the end, our\r\napparent success is really an injury to us.\r\n\r\nI know that this is very desirable with me, as with everybody else, that\r\nall the elements of the opposition shall unite in the next Presidential\r\nelection and in all future time. I am anxious that that should be; but\r\nthere are things seriously to be considered in relation to that matter.\r\nIf the terms can be arranged, I am in favor of the union. But suppose\r\nwe shall take up some man, and put him upon one end or the other of the\r\nticket, who declares himself against us in regard to the prevention of the\r\nspread of slavery, who turns up his nose and says he is tired of hearing\r\nanything more about it, who is more against us than against the enemy,\r\nwhat will be the issue? Why, he will get no slave States, after all,--he\r\nhas tried that already until being beat is the rule for him. If we\r\nnominate him upon that ground, he will not carry a slave State; and\r\nnot only so, but that portion of our men who are high-strung upon the\r\nprinciple we really fight for will not go for him, and he won't get a\r\nsingle electoral vote anywhere, except, perhaps, in the State of Maryland.\r\nThere is no use in saying to us that we are stubborn and obstinate because\r\nwe won't do some such thing as this. We cannot do it. We cannot get our\r\nmen to vote it. I speak by the card, that we cannot give the State of\r\nIllinois in such case by fifty thousand. We would be flatter down than the\r\n\"Negro Democracy\" themselves have the heart to wish to see us.\r\n\r\nAfter saying this much let me say a little on the other side. There are\r\nplenty of men in the slave States that are altogether good enough for me\r\nto be either President or Vice-President, provided they will profess their\r\nsympathy with our purpose, and will place themselves on the ground that\r\nour men, upon principle, can vote for them. There are scores of them, good\r\nmen in their character for intelligence and talent and integrity. If such\r\na one will place himself upon the right ground, I am for his occupying one\r\nplace upon the next Republican or opposition ticket. I will heartily\r\ngo for him. But unless he does so place himself, I think it a matter of\r\nperfect nonsense to attempt to bring about a union upon any other basis;\r\nthat if a union be made, the elements will scatter so that there can be no\r\nsuccess for such a ticket, nor anything like success. The good old maxims\r\nof the Bible axe applicable, and truly applicable, to human affairs, and\r\nin this, as in other things, we may say here that he who is not for us is\r\nagainst us; he who gathereth not with us, scattereth. I should be glad to\r\nhave some of the many good and able and noble men of the South to place\r\nthemselves where we can confer upon them the high honor of an election\r\nupon one or the other end of our ticket. It would do my soul good to do\r\nthat thing. It would enable us to teach them that, inasmuch as we select\r\none of their own number to carry out our principles, we are free from the\r\ncharge that we mean more than we say.\r\n\r\nBut, my friends, I have detained you much longer than I expected to do.\r\nI believe I may do myself the compliment to say that you have stayed\r\nand heard me with great patience, for which I return you my most sincere\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON PROTECTIVE TARIFFS\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD WALLACE.\r\n\r\nCLINTON, October 11, 1859\r\n\r\nDr. EDWARD WALLACE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am here just now attending court. Yesterday, before I left\r\nSpringfield, your brother, Dr. William S. Wallace, showed me a letter of\r\nyours, in which you kindly mention my name, inquiring for my tariff views,\r\nand suggest the propriety of my writing a letter upon the subject. I was\r\nan old Henry-Clay-Tariff Whig. In old times I made more speeches on that\r\nsubject than any other.\r\n\r\nI have not since changed my views. I believe yet, if we could have a\r\nmoderate, carefully adjusted protective tariff, so far acquiesced in as\r\nnot to be a perpetual subject of political strife, squabbles changes, and\r\nuncertainties, it would be better for us. Still it is my opinion that just\r\nnow the revival of that question will not advance the cause itself, or the\r\nman who revives it.\r\n\r\nI have not thought much on the subject recently, but my general impression\r\nis that the necessity for a protective tariff will ere long force its\r\nold opponents to take it up; and then its old friends can join in and\r\nestablish it on a more firm and durable basis. We, the Old Whigs, have\r\nbeen entirely beaten out on the tariff question, and we shall not be able\r\nto re-establish the policy until the absence of it shall have demonstrated\r\nthe necessity for it in the minds of men heretofore opposed to it.\r\nWith this view, I should prefer to not now write a public letter on the\r\nsubject. I therefore wish this to be considered confidential. I shall be\r\nvery glad to receive a letter from you.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON MORTGAGES\r\n\r\nTO W. DUNGY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, November, 2, 1859.\r\n\r\nWM. DUNGY, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of October 27 is received. When a mortgage is given\r\nto secure two notes, and one of the notes is sold and assigned, if the\r\nmortgaged premises are only sufficient to pay one note, the one assigned\r\nwill take it all. Also, an execution from a judgment on the assigned note\r\nmay take it all; it being the same thing in substance. There is redemption\r\non execution sales from the United States Court just as from any other\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nYou did not mention the name of the plaintiff or defendant in the suit,\r\nand so I can tell nothing about it as to sales, bids, etc. Write again.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1859.\r\n\r\n............. But you Democrats are for the Union; and you greatly fear\r\nthe success of the Republicans would destroy the Union. Why? Do the\r\nRepublicans declare against the Union? Nothing like it. Your own statement\r\nof it is that if the Black Republicans elect a President, you \"won't stand\r\nit.\" You will break up the Union. If we shall constitutionally elect a\r\nPresident, it will be our duty to see that you submit. Old John Brown has\r\nbeen executed for treason against a State. We cannot object, even though\r\nhe agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong. That cannot excuse violence,\r\nbloodshed and treason. It could avail him nothing that he might think\r\nhimself right. So, if we constitutionally elect a President, and therefore\r\nyou undertake to destroy the Union, it will be our duty to deal with you\r\nas old John Brown has been dealt with. We shall try to do our duty. We\r\nhope and believe that in no section will a majority so act as to render\r\nsuch extreme measures necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. W. DOLE, G. S. HUBBARD, AND W. H. BROWN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. 14, 1859\r\n\r\nMESSRS. DOLE, HUBBARD & BROWN.\r\n\r\nGENT.:--Your favor of the 12th is at hand, and it gives me pleasure to\r\nbe able to answer it. It is not my intention to take part in any of\r\nthe rivalries for the gubernatorial nomination; but the fear of being\r\nmisunderstood upon that subject ought not to deter me from doing justice\r\nto Mr. Judd, and preventing a wrong being done to him by the use of nay\r\nname in connection with alleged wrongs to me.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your first question, as to whether Mr. Judd was guilty of\r\nany unfairness to me at the time of Senator Trumbull's election, I answer\r\nunhesitatingly in the negative; Mr. Judd owed no political allegiance\r\nto any party whose candidate I was. He was in the Senate, holding over,\r\nhaving been elected by a Democratic Constituency. He never was in any\r\ncaucus of the friends who sought to make me U. S. Senator, never gave me\r\nany promises or pledges to support me, and subsequent events have greatly\r\ntended to prove the wisdom, politically, of Mr. Judd's course. The\r\nelection of Judge Trumbull strongly tended to sustain and preserve the\r\nposition of that lion of the Democrats who condemned the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise, and left them in a position of joining with us in\r\nforming the Republican party, as was done at the Bloomington convention in\r\n1856.\r\n\r\nDuring the canvass of 1858 for the senatorship my belief was, and\r\nstill is, that I had no more sincere and faithful friend than Mr.\r\nJudd--certainly none whom I trusted more. His position as chairman of the\r\nState Central Committee led to my greater intercourse with him, and to\r\nmy giving him a larger share of my confidence, than with or to almost any\r\nother friend; and I have never suspected that that confidence was, to any\r\ndegree, misplaced.\r\n\r\nMy relations with Mr. Judo since the organization of the Republican\r\nparty, in, our State, in 1856, and especially since the adjournment of the\r\nLegislature in Feb., 1857, have been so very intimate that I deem it an\r\nimpossibility that he could have been dealing treacherously with me. He\r\nhas also, at all times, appeared equally true and faithful to the party.\r\nIn his position as chairman of the committee, I believe he did all that\r\nany man could have done. The best of us are liable to commit errors, which\r\nbecome apparent by subsequent developments; but I do not know of a single\r\nerror, even, committed by Mr. Judd, since he and I have acted together\r\npolitically.\r\n\r\nI, had occasionally heard these insinuations against Mr. Judd, before the\r\nreceipt of your letter; and in no instance have I hesitated to pronounce\r\nthem wholly unjust, to the full extent of my knowledge and belief. I have\r\nbeen, and still am, very anxious to take no part between the many friends,\r\nall good and true, who are mentioned as candidates for a Republican\r\ngubernatorial nomination; but I can not feel that my own honor is quite\r\nclear if I remain silent when I hear any one of them assailed about\r\nmatters of which I believe I know more than his assailants.\r\n\r\nI take pleasure in adding that, of all the avowed friends I had in the\r\ncanvass of last year, I do not suspect any of having acted treacherously\r\nto me, or to our cause; and that there is not one of them in whose\r\nhonesty, honor, and integrity I, today, have greater confidence than I\r\nhave in those of Mr. Judd.\r\n\r\nI dislike to appear before the public in this matter; but you are at\r\nliberty to make such use of this letter as you may think justice requires.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. M. PARSONS AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 19, 1859.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. G. M. PARSONS AND OTHERS, CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, ETC.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter of the 7th instant, accompanied by a similar one\r\nfrom the governor-elect, the Republican State officers, and the Republican\r\nmembers of the State Board of Equalization of Ohio, both requesting of me,\r\nfor publication in permanent form, copies of the political debates between\r\nSenator Douglas and myself last year, has been received. With my grateful\r\nacknowledgments to both you and them for the very flattering terms in\r\nwhich the request is communicated, I transmit you the copies. The copies I\r\nsend you are as reported and printed by the respective friends of Senator\r\nDouglas and myself, at the time--that is, his by his friends, and mine by\r\nmine. It would be an unwarrantable liberty for us to change a word or\r\na letter in his, and the changes I have made in mine, you perceive, are\r\nverbal only, and very few in number. I wish the reprint to be precisely as\r\nthe copies I send, without any comment whatever.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH\r\n\r\nTO J. W. FELL,\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, December 20, 1859.\r\n\r\nJ. W. FELL, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Herewith is a little sketch, as you requested. There is not\r\nmuch of it, for the reason, I suppose, that there is not much of me. If\r\nanything be made out of it, I wish it to be modest, and not to go beyond\r\nthe material. If it were thought necessary to incorporate anything from\r\nany of my speeches I suppose there would be no objection. Of course it\r\nmust not appear to have been written by myself.\r\n\r\nYours very truly, A. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI was born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My parents\r\nwere both born in Virginia, of undistinguished families--second families,\r\nperhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth year, was of a\r\nfamily of the name of Hanks, some of whom now reside in Adams, and others\r\nin Macon County, Illinois. My paternal grandfather, Abraham Lincoln,\r\nemigrated from Rockingham County, Virginia, to Kentucky about 1781 or\r\n1782, where a year or two later he was killed by the Indians, not in\r\nbattle, but by stealth, when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest.\r\nHis ancestors, who were Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks County,\r\nPennsylvania. An effort to identify them with the New England family\r\nof the same name ended in nothing more definite than a similarity of\r\nChristian names in both families, such as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai, Solomon,\r\nAbraham, and the like.\r\n\r\nMy father, at the death of his father, was but six years of age, and he\r\ngrew up literally without education. He removed from Kentucky to what is\r\nnow Spencer County, Indiana, in my eighth year. We reached our new home\r\nabout the time that State came into the Union. It was a wild region, with\r\nmany bears and other wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up.\r\nThere were some schools, so called, but no qualification was ever required\r\nof a teacher beyond \"readin', writin', and cipherin\"' to the Rule of\r\nThree. If a straggler supposed to understand Latin happened to sojourn\r\nin the neighborhood he was looked upon as a wizard. There was absolutely\r\nnothing to excite ambition for education. Of course, when I came of age I\r\ndid not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and cipher to\r\nthe Rule of Three, but that was all. I have not been to school since. The\r\nlittle advance I now have upon this store of education I have picked up\r\nfrom time to time under the pressure of necessity.\r\n\r\nI was raised to farm work, which I continued till I was twenty-two. At\r\ntwenty-one I came to Illinois, Macon County. Then I got to New Salem, at\r\nthat time in Sangamon, now in Menard County, where I remained a year as a\r\nsort of clerk in a store. Then came the Black Hawk war; and I was elected\r\na captain of volunteers, a success which gave me more pleasure than any I\r\nhave had since. I went the campaign, was elected, ran for the Legislature\r\nthe same year (1832), and was beaten--the only time I ever have been\r\nbeaten by the people. The next and three succeeding biennial elections I\r\nwas elected to the Legislature. I was not a candidate afterward. During\r\nthis legislative period I had studied law, and removed to Springfield to\r\npractice it. In 1846 I was once elected to the lower House of Congress.\r\nWas not a candidate for re-election. From 1849 to 1854, both inclusive,\r\npracticed law more assiduously than ever before. Always a Whig in\r\npolitics; and generally on the Whig electoral tickets, making active\r\ncanvasses. I was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise aroused me again. What I have done since then is\r\npretty well known.\r\n\r\nIf any personal description of me is thought desirable, it may be said I\r\nam, in height, six feet four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing on an\r\naverage one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black\r\nhair and gray eyes. No other marks or brands recollected.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON NOMINATION TO THE NATIONAL TICKET\r\n\r\nTo N. B. JUDD.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, FEBRUARY 9, 1859\r\n\r\nHON. N. B. JUDD.\r\n\r\nDEAR Sir:--I am not in a position where it would hurt much for me to not\r\nbe nominated on the national ticket; but I am where it would hurt some\r\nfor me to not get the Illinois delegates. What I expected when I wrote\r\nthe letter to Messrs. Dole and others is now happening. Your discomfited\r\nassailants are most bitter against me; and they will, for revenge upon me,\r\nlay to the Bates egg in the South, and to the Seward egg in the North, and\r\ngo far toward squeezing me out in the middle with nothing. Can you help\r\nme a little in this matter in your end of the vineyard. I mean this to be\r\nprivate.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT THE COOPER INSTITUTE, NEW YORK FEBRUARY 27, 1860\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF NEW YORK:--The facts with which I\r\nshall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar; nor is there anything\r\nnew in the general use I shall make of them. If there shall be any\r\nnovelty, it will be in the mode of presenting the facts, and the\r\ninferences and observations following that presentation.\r\n\r\nIn his speech last autumn at Columbus, Ohio, as reported in the New York\r\nTimes, Senator Douglas said:\r\n\r\n\"Our fathers, when they framed the Government under which we live,\r\nunderstood this question just as well, and even better than we do now.\"\r\n\r\nI fully indorse this, and I adopt it as a text for this discourse. I so\r\nadopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting-point for\r\na discussion between Republicans and that wing of the Democracy headed by\r\nSenator Douglas. It simply leaves the inquiry: What was the understanding\r\nthose fathers had of the question mentioned?\r\n\r\nWhat is the frame of Government under which we live?\r\n\r\nThe answer must be--the Constitution of the United States. That\r\nConstitution consists of the original, framed in 1787 (and under which\r\nthe present Government first went into operation), and twelve subsequently\r\nframed amendments, the first ten of which were framed in 1789.\r\n\r\nWho were our fathers that framed the Constitution? I suppose the\r\n\"thirty-nine\" who signed the original instrument may be fairly called\r\nour fathers who framed that part of the present Government. It is almost\r\nexactly true to say they framed it, and it is altogether true to say they\r\nfairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTheir names, being familiar to nearly all, and accessible to quite all,\r\nneed not now be repeated.\r\n\r\nI take these \"thirty-nine,\" for the present, as being our \"fathers who\r\nframed the Government under which we live.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the question which, according to the text, those fathers\r\nunderstood \"just as well, and even better than we do now\"?\r\n\r\nIt is this: Does the proper division of local from Federal authority, or\r\nanything in the Constitution, forbid our Federal Government to control as\r\nto slavery in our Federal Territories?\r\n\r\nUpon this Senator Douglas holds the affirmative, and Republicans the\r\nnegative. This affirmation and denial form an issue, and this issue--this\r\nquestion is precisely what the text declares our fathers understood\r\n\"better than we.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire whether the \"thirty-nine,\" or any of them, acted upon\r\nthis question; and if they did, how they acted upon it--how they expressed\r\nthat better understanding.\r\n\r\nIn 1784, three years before the Constitution--the United States then\r\nowning the Northwestern Territory, and no other--the Congress of the\r\nConfederation had before them the question of prohibiting slavery in\r\nthat Territory; and four of the \"thirty nine\" who afterward framed the\r\nConstitution were in that Congress and voted on that question. Of\r\nthese, Roger Sherman, Thomas Mifflin, and Hugh Williamson voted for the\r\nprohibition, thus showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing\r\nlocal from Federal authority, nor anything else, properly forbade the\r\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory. The\r\nother of the four--James McHenry voted against the prohibition, showing\r\nthat, for some cause, he thought it improper to vote for it.\r\n\r\nIn 1787, still before the Constitution, but while the convention was in\r\nsession framing it, and while the Northwestern Territory still was\r\nthe only Territory owned by the United States, the same question of\r\nprohibiting slavery in the Territory again came before the Congress of the\r\nConfederation; and two more of the \"thirty-nine\" who afterward signed the\r\nConstitution were in that Congress, and voted on the question. They were\r\nWilliam Blount and William Few; and they both voted for the prohibition\r\nthus showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from\r\nFederal authority, nor anything else, properly forbade the Federal\r\nGovernment to control as to slavery in Federal territory. This time the\r\nprohibition became a law, being part of what is now well known as the\r\nOrdinance of '87.\r\n\r\nThe question of Federal control of slavery in the Territories seems not\r\nto have been directly before the convention which framed the original\r\nConstitution; and hence it is not recorded that the \"thirty-nine,\" or any\r\nof them, while engaged on that instrument, expressed any opinion on that\r\nprecise question.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution, an act\r\nwas passed to enforce the Ordinance of '87, including the prohibition of\r\nslavery in the Northwestern Territory. The bill for this act was reported\r\nby one of the \"thirty-nine,\" Thomas Fitzsimmons, then a member of the\r\nHouse of Representatives from Pennsylvania. It went through all its stages\r\nwithout a word of opposition, and finally passed both branches without\r\nyeas and nays, which is equivalent to a unanimous passage. In this\r\nCongress there were sixteen of the thirty-nine fathers who framed the\r\noriginal Constitution. They were John Langdon, Nicholas Gilman, Wm. S.\r\nJohnnson, Roger Sherman, Robert Morris, Thos. Fitzsimmons, William Few,\r\nAbraham Baldwin, Rufus King, William Paterson, George Claimer, Richard\r\nBassett, George Read, Pierce Butler, Daniel Carroll, James Madison.\r\n\r\nThis shows that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from\r\nFederal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, properly forbade\r\nCongress to prohibit slavery in the Federal territory; else both their\r\nfidelity to correct principles and their oath to support the Constitution\r\nwould have constrained them to oppose the prohibition.\r\n\r\nAgain: George Washington, another of the \"thirty nine,\" was then President\r\nof the United States, and, as such, approved and signed the bill;\r\nthus completing its validity as a law, and thus showing that, in his\r\nunderstanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything\r\nin the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to\r\nslavery in Federal territory.\r\n\r\nNo great while after the adoption of the original Constitution, North\r\nCarolina ceded to the Federal Government the country now constituting the\r\nState of Tennessee; and, a few years later, Georgia ceded that which\r\nnow constitutes the States of Mississippi and Alabama. In both deeds of\r\ncession it was made a condition by the ceding States that the Federal\r\nGovernment should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country. Besides this,\r\nslavery was then actually in the ceded country. Under these circumstances,\r\nCongress, on taking charge of these countries, did not absolutely prohibit\r\nslavery within them. But they did interfere with it--take control of\r\nit--even there, to a certain extent. In 1798, Congress organized the\r\nTerritory of Mississippi: In the act of organization they prohibited the\r\nbringing of slaves into the Territory from any place without the United\r\nStates, by fine and giving freedom to slaves so brought. This act passed\r\nboth branches of Congress without yeas and nays. In that Congress were\r\nthree of the \"thirty-nine\" who framed the original Constitution. They were\r\nJohn Langdon, George Read, and Abraham Baldwin. They all, probably, voted\r\nfor it. Certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon\r\nrecord, if, in their understanding, any line dividing local from Federal\r\nauthority, or anything in the Constitution, properly forbade the Federal\r\nGovernment to control as to slavery in Federal territory.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, the Federal Government purchased the Louisiana country. Our\r\nformer territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own States;\r\nbut this Louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation. In 1804,\r\nCongress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now\r\nconstitutes the State of Lousiana. New Orleans, lying within that part,\r\nwas an old and comparatively large city. There were other considerable\r\ntowns and settlements, and slavery was extensively and thoroughly\r\nintermingled with the people. Congress did not, in the Territorial Act,\r\nprohibit slavery; but they did interfere with it take control of it--in\r\na more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of Mississippi.\r\nThe substance of the provision therein made in relation to slaves was:\r\n\r\nFirst. That no slave should be imported into the Territory from foreign\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nSecond. That no slave should be carried into it who had been imported into\r\nthe United States since the first day of May, 1798.\r\n\r\nThird. That no slave should be carried into it except by the owner, and\r\nfor his own use as a settler; the penalty in all the cases being a fine\r\nupon the violator of the law, and freedom to the slave.\r\n\r\nThis act also was passed without yeas and nays. In the Congress which\r\npassed it there were two of the \"thirty-nine.\" They were Abraham Baldwin\r\nand Jonathan Dayton. As stated in the case of Mississippi, it is probable\r\nthey both voted for it. They would not have allowed it to pass without\r\nrecording their opposition to it, if, in their understanding, it violated\r\neither the line properly dividing local from Federal authority, or any\r\nprovision of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn 1819-20 came and passed the Missouri question. Many votes were taken,\r\nby yeas and nays, in both branches of Congress, upon the various phases\r\nof the general question. Two of the \"thirty-nine\"--Rufus King and Charles\r\nPinckney were members of that Congress. Mr. King steadily voted for\r\nslavery prohibition and against all compromises, while Mr. Pinckney as\r\nsteadily voted against slavery prohibition, and against all compromises.\r\nBy this, Mr. King showed that, in his understanding, no line dividing\r\nlocal from Federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, was\r\nviolated by Congress prohibiting slavery in Federal territory; while Mr.\r\nPinckney, by his vote, showed that in his understanding there was some\r\nsufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case.\r\n\r\nThe cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the \"thirty-nine,\" or of\r\nany of them, upon the direct issue, which I have been able to discover.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate the persons who thus acted, as being four in 1784, two\r\nin 1787, seventeen in 1789, three in 1798, two in 1804, and two in\r\n1819-20--there would be thirty of them. But this would be counting, John\r\nLangdon, Roger Sherman, William Few, Rufus King, and George Read, each\r\ntwice, and Abraham Baldwin three times. The true number of those of the\r\n\"thirty-nine\" whom I have shown to have acted upon the question which, by\r\nthe text, they understood better than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen\r\nnot shown to have acted upon it in any way.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have twenty-three out of our thirty-nine fathers \"who\r\nframed the Government under which we live,\" who have, upon their official\r\nresponsibility and their corporal oaths, acted upon the very question\r\nwhich the text affirms they \"understood just as well, and even better\r\nthan we do now\"; and twenty-one of them--a clear majority of the whole\r\n\"thirty-nine\"--so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political\r\nimpropriety and wilful perjury, if, in their understanding, any proper\r\ndivision between local and Federal authority, or anything in the\r\nConstitution they had made themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the\r\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories.\r\nThus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder than words, so\r\nactions under such responsibilities speak still louder.\r\n\r\nTwo of the twenty-three voted against Congressional prohibition of slavery\r\nin the Federal Territories, in the instances in which they acted upon the\r\nquestion. But for what reasons they so voted is not known. They may have\r\ndone so because they thought a proper division of local from Federal\r\nauthority, or some provision or principle of the Constitution, stood in\r\nthe way; or they may, without any such question, have voted against\r\nthe prohibition on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds\r\nof expediency. No one who has sworn to support the Constitution can\r\nconscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional\r\nmeasure, however expedient he may think it; but one may and ought to vote\r\nagainst a measure which he deems constitutional, if, at the same time, he\r\ndeems it inexpedient. It therefore would be unsafe to set down even the\r\ntwo who voted against the prohibition as having done so because, in their\r\nunderstanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or\r\nanything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as\r\nto slavery in Federal territory.\r\n\r\nThe remaining sixteen of the \"thirty-nine,\" so far as I have discovered,\r\nhave left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of\r\nFederal control on slavery in the Federal Territories. But there is much\r\nreason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not\r\nhave appeared different from that of their twenty-three compeers, had it\r\nbeen manifested at all.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have purposely omitted\r\nwhatever understanding may have been manifested by any person, however\r\ndistinguished, other than the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original\r\nConstitution; and, for the same reason, I have also omitted whatever\r\nunderstanding may have been manifested by any of the \"thirty tine\" even on\r\nany other phase of the general question of slavery. If we should look into\r\ntheir acts and declarations on those other phases, as the foreign slave\r\ntrade, and the morality and policy of slavery generally, it would appear\r\nto us that on the direct question of Federal control of slavery in Federal\r\nTerritories, the sixteen, if they had acted at all, would probably have\r\nacted just as the twenty-three did. Among that sixteen were several of\r\nthe most noted anti-slavery men of those times--as Dr. Franklin, Alexander\r\nHamilton, and Gouverneur Morris while there was not one now known to have\r\nbeen otherwise, unless it may be John Rutledge, of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe sum of the whole is, that of our thirty-nine fathers who framed\r\nthe original Constitution, twenty-one--a clear majority of the\r\nwhole--certainly understood that no proper division of local from\r\nFederal authority, nor any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal\r\nGovernment to control slavery in the Federal Territories; whilst all the\r\nrest probably had the same understanding. Such, unquestionably, was the\r\nunderstanding of our fathers who framed the original Constitution; and the\r\ntext affirms that they understood the question \"better than we.\"\r\n\r\nBut, so far, I have been considering the understanding of the question\r\nmanifested by the framers of the original Constitution. In and by the\r\noriginal instrument, a mode was provided for amending it; and, as I have\r\nalready stated, the present frame of \"the Government under which we live\"\r\nconsists of that original, and twelve amendatory articles framed and\r\nadopted since. Those who now insist that Federal control of slavery in\r\nFederal Territories violates the Constitution, point us to the provisions\r\nwhich they suppose it thus violates; and, as I understand, they all fix\r\nupon provisions in these amendatory articles, and not in the original\r\ninstrument. The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott case, plant themselves\r\nupon the fifth amendment, which provides that no person shall be deprived\r\nof \"life, liberty, or property without due process of law\"; while Senator\r\nDouglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth\r\namendment, providing that \"the powers not delegated to the United States\r\nby the Constitution\" \"are reserved to the States respectively, or to the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nNow, it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first Congress\r\nwhich sat under the Constitution--the identical Congress which passed\r\nthe act already mentioned, enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the\r\nNorthwestern Territory. Not only was it the same Congress, but they were\r\nthe identical same individual men who, at the same session, and at the\r\nsame time within the session, had under consideration, and in progress\r\ntoward maturity, these Constitutional amendments, and this act prohibiting\r\nslavery in all the territory the nation then owned. The Constitutional\r\namendments were introduced before and passed after the act enforcing the\r\nOrdinance of '87; so that, during the whole pendency of the act to enforce\r\nthe Ordinance, the Constitutional amendments were also pending.\r\n\r\nThe seventy-six members of that Congress, including sixteen of the framers\r\nof the original Constitution, as before stated, were pre-eminently our\r\nfathers who framed that part of \"the Government under which we live,\"\r\nwhich is now claimed as forbidding the Federal Government to control\r\nslavery in the Federal Territories.\r\n\r\nIs it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that\r\nthe two things which that Congress deliberately framed, and carried to\r\nmaturity at the same time, are absolutely inconsistent with each other?\r\nAnd does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with\r\nthe other affirmation from the same mouth, that those who did the two\r\nthings alleged to be inconsistent understood whether they really were\r\ninconsistent better than we--better than he who affirms that they are\r\ninconsistent?\r\n\r\nIt is surely safe to assume that the thirty-nine framers of the original\r\nConstitution, and the seventy-six members of the Congress which framed the\r\namendments thereto, taken together, do certainly include those who may be\r\nfairly called \"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live.\"\r\nAnd, so assuming, I defy any man to show that any one of them ever, in his\r\nwhole life, declared that, in his understanding, any proper division of\r\nlocal from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the\r\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories. I\r\ngo a step further. I defy any one to show that any living man in the\r\nworld ever did, prior to the beginning of the present century (and I\r\nmight almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present\r\ncentury), declare that, in his understanding, any proper division of\r\nlocal from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the\r\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories.\r\nTo those who now so declare, I give not only \"our fathers who framed the\r\nGovernment under which we live,\" but with them all other living men within\r\nthe century in which it was framed, among whom to search, and they shall\r\nnot be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them.\r\n\r\nNow and here let me guard a little against being misunderstood. I do not\r\nmean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers\r\ndid. To do so would be to discard all the lights of current experience to\r\nreject all progress, all improvement. What I do say is that, if we would\r\nsupplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case, we should\r\ndo so upon evidence so conclusive, and argument so clear, that even their\r\ngreat authority, fairly considered and weighed, cannot stand; and most\r\nsurely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the\r\nquestion better than we.\r\n\r\nIf any man at this day sincerely believes that proper division of local\r\nfrom Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbids the\r\nFederal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories, he\r\nis right to say so, and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence\r\nand fair argument which he can. But he has no right to mislead others who\r\nhave less access to history, and less leisure to study it, into the false\r\nbelief that \"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live\"\r\nwere of the same opinion thus substituting falsehood and deception for\r\ntruthful evidence and fair argument. If any man at this day sincerely\r\nbelieves \"our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live,\"\r\nused and applied principles, in other cases, which ought to have led them\r\nto understand that a proper division of local from Federal authority, or\r\nsome part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control\r\nas to slavery in the Federal Territories, he is right to say so. But he\r\nshould, at the same time, brave the responsibility of declaring that,\r\nin his opinion, he understands their principles better than they did\r\nthemselves; and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by\r\nasserting that they \"understood the question just as well, and even better\r\nthan we do now.\"\r\n\r\nBut enough! Let all who believe that \"our fathers, who framed the\r\nGovernment under which we live, understood this question just as well, and\r\neven better than we do now,\" speak as they spoke, and act as they acted\r\nupon it. This is all Republicans ask--all Republicans desire--in relation\r\nto slavery. As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked, as an\r\nevil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only because\r\nof, and so far as, its actual presence among us makes that toleration and\r\nprotection a necessity. Let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be\r\nnot grudgingly, but fully and fairly maintained. For this Republicans\r\ncontend, and with this, so far as I know or believe, they will be content.\r\n\r\nAnd now, if they would listen--as I suppose they will not--I would address\r\na few words to the Southern people.\r\n\r\nI would say to them: You consider yourselves a reasonable and a just\r\npeople; and I consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice\r\nyou are not inferior to any other people. Still, when you speak of us\r\nRepublicans, you do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the\r\nbest, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates\r\nor murderers, but nothing like it to \"Black Republicans.\" In all\r\nyour contentions with one another, each of you deems an unconditional\r\ncondemnation of \"Black Republicanism\" as the first thing to be attended\r\nto. Indeed, such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable\r\nprerequisite license, so to speak among you, to be admitted or permitted\r\nto speak at all: Now; can you, or not, be prevailed upon to pause, and to\r\nconsider whether this is quite just to us, or even to yourselves? Bring\r\nforward your charges and specifications, and then be patient long enough\r\nto hear us deny or justify.\r\n\r\nYou say we are sectional. We deny it. That makes an issue; and the burden\r\nof proof is upon you. You produce your proof; and what is it? Why, that\r\nour party has no existence in your section--gets no votes in your section.\r\nThe fact is substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If it does,\r\nthen in case we should, without change of principle, begin to get votes in\r\nyour section, we should thereby cease to be sectional. You cannot escape\r\nthis conclusion; and yet, are you willing to abide by it? If you are, you\r\nwill probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional, for we shall\r\nget votes in your section this very year. You will then begin to discover,\r\nas the truth plainly is, that your proof, does not touch the issue. The\r\nfact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making, and\r\nnot of ours. And if there be fault in that fact, that fault is primarily\r\nyours, and remains so until you show that we repel you by, some wrong\r\nprinciple or practice. If we do repel you by any wrong principle or\r\npractice, the fault is ours; but this brings you to where you ought to\r\nhave started to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If\r\nour principle, put in practice, would wrong your section for the benefit\r\nof ours, or for any other object, then our principle, and we with it, are\r\nsectional, and are justly opposed and denounced as such. Meet us, then, on\r\nthe question of whether our principle, put in practice, would wrong your\r\nsection; and so meet us as if it were possible that something may be said\r\non our side. Do you accept the challenge? No! Then you really believe that\r\nthe principle which \"our fathers who framed the Government under which we\r\nlive\" thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and\r\nagain, upon their official oaths, is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand\r\nyour condemnation without a moment's consideration.\r\n\r\nSome of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional\r\nparties given by Washington in his Farewell Address. Less than eight years\r\nbefore Washington gave that warning, he had, as President of the United\r\nStates, approved and signed an act of Congress enforcing the prohibition\r\nof slavery in the Northwestern Territory, which act embodied the policy of\r\nthe Government upon that subject up to, and at, the very moment he penned\r\nthat warning; and about one year after he penned it, he wrote La Fayette\r\nthat he considered that prohibition a wise measure, expressing in the same\r\nconnection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon\r\nthis same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or\r\nin our hands against you? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast\r\nthe blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon\r\nyou, who repudiate it? We respect that warning of Washington, and we\r\ncommend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right\r\napplication of it.\r\n\r\nBut you say you are conservative--eminently conservative--while we\r\nare revolutionary, destructive, or something, of the sort. What is\r\nconservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against a new and\r\nuntried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point\r\nin controversy which was adopted by \"our fathers who framed the Government\r\nunder which we live\"; while you with one accord reject, and scout, and\r\nspit upon that old policy and insist upon substituting something new.\r\nTrue, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be.\r\nYou are divided on new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in\r\nrejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some of you are\r\nfor reviving the foreign slave trade; some for a Congressional slave\r\ncode for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the Territories to\r\nprohibit slavery within their limits; some for maintaining slavery in the\r\nTerritories through the judiciary; some for the \"gur-reat pur-rinciple\"\r\nthat \"if one man would enslave another, no third man should object,\"\r\nfantastically called \"popular sovereignty\"; but never a man among you in\r\nfavor of Federal prohibition of slavery in Federal Territories, according\r\nto the practice of \"our fathers who framed the Government under which\r\nwe live.\" Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an\r\nadvocate in the century within which our Government originated. Consider,\r\nthen, whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves, and your charge\r\nof destructiveness against us, are based on the most clear and stable\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nAgain: You say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it\r\nformerly was. We deny it. We admit that it is more prominent, but we deny\r\nthat we made it so. It was not we, but you, who discarded the old policy\r\nof the fathers. We resisted and still resist your innovation; and thence\r\ncomes the greater prominence of the question. Would you have that question\r\nreduced to its former proportions? Go back to that old policy. What has\r\nbeen will be again, under the same conditions. If you would have the peace\r\nof the old times, readopt the precepts and policy of the old times.\r\n\r\nYou charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves. We deny it;\r\nand what is your proof'? Harper's Ferry! John Brown!! John Brown was no\r\nRepublican; and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his\r\nHarper's Ferry enterprise. If any member of our party is guilty in that\r\nmatter you know it or you do not know it. If you do know it, you are\r\ninexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact. If you do\r\nnot know it, you are inexcusable for asserting it, and especially for\r\npersisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the\r\nproof. You need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not\r\nknow to be true is simply malicious slander.\r\n\r\nSome of you admit that no Republican designedly aided or encouraged\r\nthe Harper's Ferry affair, but still insist that our doctrines and\r\ndeclarations necessarily lead to such results. We do not believe it. We\r\nknow we hold to no doctrine, and make no declaration, which were not held\r\nto and made by our fathers who framed the Government under which we live.\r\nYou never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair. When it occurred,\r\nsome important State elections were near at hand, and you were in evident\r\nglee with the belief that, by charging the blame upon us, you could get\r\nan advantage of us in those elections. The elections came, and your\r\nexpectations were not quite fulfilled. Every Republican man knew that,\r\nas to himself at least, your charge was a slander, and he was not much\r\ninclined by it to cast his vote in your favor. Republican doctrines\r\nand declarations are accompanied with a continued protest against any\r\ninterference whatever with your slaves, or with you about your slaves.\r\nSurely, this does not encourage them to revolt. True, we do, in common\r\nwith \"our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live,\" declare\r\nour belief that slavery is wrong; but the slaves do not hear us declare\r\neven this. For any thing we say or do, the slaves would scarcely know\r\nthere is a Republican party. I believe they would not, in fact, generally\r\nknow it but for your misrepresentations of us in their hearing. In your\r\npolitical contests among yourselves, each faction charges the other with\r\nsympathy with Black Republicanism; and then, to give point to the charge,\r\ndefines Black Republicanism to simply be insurrection, blood, and thunder\r\namong the slaves.\r\n\r\nSlave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the\r\nRepublican party was organized. What induced the Southampton insurrection,\r\ntwenty-eight years ago, in which, at least, three times as many lives\r\nwere lost as at Harper's Ferry? You can scarcely stretch your very\r\nelastic fancy to the conclusion that Southampton was \"got up by Black\r\nRepublicanism.\" In the present state of things in the United States, I\r\ndo not think a general or even a very extensive slave insurrection is\r\npossible. The indispensable concert of action cannot be attained. The\r\nslaves have no means of rapid communication; nor can incendiary freemen,\r\nblack or white, supply it. The explosive materials are everywhere in\r\nparcels; but there neither are, nor can be supplied the indispensable\r\nconnecting trains.\r\n\r\nMuch is said by Southern people about the affection of slaves for their\r\nmasters and mistresses; and a part of it, at least, is true. A plot for an\r\nuprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty individuals\r\nbefore some one of them, to save the life of a favorite master or\r\nmistress, would divulge it. This is the rule; and the slave revolution\r\nin Hayti was not an exception to it, but a case occurring under peculiar\r\ncircumstances. The gunpowder plot of British history, though not connected\r\nwith slaves, was more in point. In that case, only about twenty were\r\nadmitted to the secret; and yet one of them, in his anxiety to save a\r\nfriend, betrayed the plot to that friend, and, by consequence, averted\r\nthe calamity. Occasional poisonings from the kitchen, and open or stealthy\r\nassassinations in the field, and local revolts, extending to a score\r\nor so, will continue to occur as the natural results of slavery; but no\r\ngeneral insurrection of slaves, as I think, can happen in this country for\r\na long time. Whoever much fears or much hopes for such an event will be\r\nalike disappointed.\r\n\r\nIn the language of Mr. Jefferson, uttered many years ago, \"It is still in\r\nour power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably,\r\nand in such slow degrees as that the evil will wear off insensibly, and\r\ntheir places be, pari passu, filled up by free white laborers. If, on the\r\ncontrary, it is left to force itself on, human nature must shudder at the\r\nprospect held up.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson did not mean to say, nor do I, that the power of\r\nemancipation is in the Federal Government. He spoke of Virginia; and, as\r\nto the power of emancipation, I speak of the slave holding States\r\nonly. The Federal Government, however, as we insist, has the power of\r\nrestraining the extension of the institution--the power to insure that\r\na slave insurrection shall never occur on any American soil which is now\r\nfree from slavery.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown's effort was peculiar. It was not a slave insurrection. It\r\nwas an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves, in which the\r\nslaves refused to participate. In fact, it was so absurd that the slaves,\r\nwith all their ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not succeed. That\r\naffair, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many attempts related in\r\nhistory at the assassination of kings and emperors. An enthusiast broods\r\nover the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by\r\nHeaven to liberate them. He ventures the attempt, which ends in little\r\nelse than his own execution. Orsini's attempt on Louis Napoleon and John\r\nBrown's attempt at Harper's Ferry were, in their philosophy, precisely the\r\nsame. The eagerness to cast blame on old England in the one case, and\r\non New England in the other, does not disprove the sameness of the two\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nAnd how much would it avail you, if you could, by the use of John Brown,\r\nHelper's Book, and the like, break up the Republican organization? Human\r\naction can be modified to some extent, but human nature cannot be changed.\r\nThere is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation, which\r\ncast at least a million and a half of votes. You cannot destroy that\r\njudgment and feeling--that sentiment--by breaking up the political\r\norganization which rallies around it. You can scarcely scatter and\r\ndisperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your\r\nheaviest fire; but if you could, how much would you gain by forcing the\r\nsentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot-box,\r\ninto some other channel? What would that other channel probably be? Would\r\nthe number of John Browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation?\r\n\r\nBut you will break up the Union rather than submit to a denial of your\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n\r\nThat has a somewhat reckless sound; but it would be palliated, if not\r\nfully justified, were we proposing, by the mere force of numbers, to\r\ndeprive you of some right plainly written down in the Constitution. But we\r\nare proposing no such thing.\r\n\r\nWhen you make these declarations, you have a specific and well-understood\r\nallusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into\r\nthe Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property. But no such\r\nright is specifically written in the Constitution. That instrument is\r\nliterally silent about any such right. We, on the contrary, deny that such\r\na right has any existence in the Constitution, even by implication.\r\n\r\nYour purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the\r\nGovernment unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution\r\nas you please on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule\r\nor ruin, in all events.\r\n\r\nThis, plainly stated, is your language. Perhaps you will say the Supreme\r\nCourt has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favor.\r\nNot quite so. But, waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and\r\ndecision, the court have decided the question for you in a sort of way.\r\nThe court have substantially said it is your constitutional right to take\r\nslaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property.\r\nWhen I say, the decision was made in a sort of way, I mean it was made\r\nin a divided court, by a bare majority of the judges, and they not quite\r\nagreeing with one another in the reasons for making it; that it is so made\r\nas that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning,\r\nand that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact--the\r\nstatement in the opinion that \"the right of property in a slave is\r\ndistinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the Constitution will show that the right of property in\r\na slave is not \"distinctly and expressly affirmed\" in it. Bear in mind,\r\nthe judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is\r\nimpliedly affirmed in the Constitution; but they pledge their veracity\r\nthat it is \"distinctly and expressly\" affirmed there--\"distinctly,\" that\r\nis, not mingled with anything else; \"expressly,\" that is, in words meaning\r\njust that, without the aid of any inference, and susceptible of no other\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nIf they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is\r\naffirmed in the instrument by implication, it would be open to others to\r\nshow that neither the word \"slave\" nor \"slavery\" is to be found in\r\nthe Constitution, nor the word \"property\" even, in any connection with\r\nlanguage alluding to the things slave or slavery; and that wherever in\r\nthat instrument the slave is alluded to, he is called a \"person\"; and\r\nwherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to, it\r\nis spoken of as \"service or labor which may be due,\" as a debt payable\r\nin service or labor. Also, it would be open to show, by contemporaneous\r\nhistory, that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery, instead of\r\nspeaking of them, was employed on purpose to exclude from the Constitution\r\nthe idea that there could be property in man.\r\n\r\nTo show all this, is easy and certain.\r\n\r\nWhen this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice,\r\nis it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken\r\nstatement, and reconsider the conclusion based upon it?\r\n\r\nAnd then it is to be remembered that \"our fathers; who framed\r\nthe Government under which we live\",--the men who made the\r\nConstitution--decided this same constitutional question in our favor,\r\nlong ago; decided it without division among themselves, when making the\r\ndecision, without division among themselves about the meaning of it after\r\nit was made, and, so far as any evidence is left, without basing it upon\r\nany mistaken statement of facts.\r\n\r\nUnder all these circumstances, do you really feel yourselves justified to\r\nbreak up this Government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be\r\nat once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action?\r\nBut you will not abide the election of a Republican President! In that\r\nsupposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say,\r\nthe great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us! That is cool. A\r\nhighwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, \"stand\r\nand deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you'll be a murderer!\"\r\n\r\nTo be sure, what the robber demanded of me-my money was my own, and I had\r\na clear right to keep it; but it was no more my own than my vote is my\r\nown; and the threat of death to me, to extort my money, and the threat of\r\ndestruction to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be distinguished\r\nin principle.\r\n\r\nA few words now to Republicans: It is exceedingly desirable that all\r\nparts of this great confederacy shall be at peace and in harmony one with\r\nanother. Let us Republicans do our part to have it so. Even though much\r\nprovoked, let us do nothing through passion and ill temper. Even though\r\nthe Southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us calmly\r\nconsider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of\r\nour duty, we possibly can. Judging by all they say and do, and by the\r\nsubject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we\r\ncan, what will satisfy them.\r\n\r\nWill they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered\r\nto them? We know they will not. In all their present complaints against\r\nus, the Territories are scarcely mentioned. Invasions and insurrections\r\nare the rage now. Will it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing\r\nto do with invasions and, insurrections? We know it will not. We so\r\nknow because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and\r\ninsurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the\r\ncharge and the denunciation.\r\n\r\nThe question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply this: We must not only\r\nlet them alone, but we must, somehow, convince them that we do let them\r\nalone. This, we know by experience, is no easy task. We have been so\r\ntrying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization, but\r\nwith no success. In all our platforms and speeches we have constantly\r\nprotested our purpose to let them alone; but this has had no tendency to\r\nconvince them. Alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they\r\nhave never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them.\r\n\r\nThese natural and apparently adequate means all failing, what will\r\nconvince them? This, and this only: cease to call slavery wrong, and join\r\nthem in calling it right. And this must be done thoroughly--done in\r\nacts as well as in words. Silence will not be tolerated--we must place\r\nourselves avowedly with them. Senator Douglas's new sedition law must be\r\nenacted and enforced, suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong,\r\nwhether made in politics, in presses, in pulpits; or in private. We must\r\narrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure. We must\r\npull down our free State constitutions. The whole atmosphere must be\r\ndisinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery, before they will\r\ncease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way. Most\r\nof them would probably say to us, \"Let us alone, do nothing to us, and\r\nsay what you please about slavery.\" But we do let them alone have never\r\ndisturbed them--so that after all it is what we say which dissatisfies\r\nthem. They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we cease saying.\r\n\r\nI am also aware they have not as yet, in terms, demanded the overthrow of\r\nour free State constitutions. Yet those constitutions declare the wrong of\r\nslavery, with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it;\r\nand when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow\r\nof these constitutions will be demanded, and nothing be left to resist the\r\ndemand. It is nothing to the contrary, that they do not demand the whole\r\nof this just now. Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do, they\r\ncan voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation. Holding, as they\r\ndo, that slavery is morally right, and socially elevating, they cannot\r\ncease to demand a full national recognition of it, as a legal right and a\r\nsocial blessing.\r\n\r\nNor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction\r\nthat slavery is wrong. If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and\r\nconstitutions against it are themselves wrong, and should be silenced and\r\nswept away. If it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality\r\nits universality; if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its\r\nextension--its enlargement. All they ask we could readily grant if we\r\nthought slavery right; all we ask they could as readily grant, if they\r\nthought it wrong. Their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the\r\nprecise fact upon which depends the whole controversy. Thinking it right,\r\nas they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition, as\r\nbeing right; but thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them? Can we\r\ncast our votes with their view, and against our own? In view of our moral,\r\nsocial, and political responsibilities, can we do this? Wrong as we think\r\nslavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is, because that\r\nmuch is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the\r\nnation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread\r\ninto the national Territories, and to overrun us here in these free\r\nStates? If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our\r\nduty, fearlessly and effectively. Let us be diverted by none of those\r\nsophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and\r\nbelabored-contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the\r\nright and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who should be neither a\r\nliving man nor a dead man-such as a policy of \"don't care\" on a question\r\nabout which all true men do care--such as Union appeals beseeching\r\ntrue Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule,\r\nand calling, not the sinners, but the righteous to repentance--such as\r\ninvocations to Washington, imploring men to unsay what Washington said,\r\nand undo what Washington did.\r\n\r\nNeither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us,\r\nnor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government nor of\r\ndungeons to ourselves. LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT, AND IN\r\nTHAT FAITH LET US, TO THE END, DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT, MARCH 6, 1860\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF NEW HAVEN:--If the Republican\r\nparty of this nation shall ever have the national House entrusted to its\r\nkeeping, it will be the duty of that party to attend to all the affairs\r\nof national housekeeping. Whatever matters of importance may come up,\r\nwhatever difficulties may arise in its way of administration of the\r\nGovernment, that party will then have to attend to. It will then be\r\ncompelled to attend to other questions, besides this question which now\r\nassumes an overwhelming importance--the question of slavery. It is true\r\nthat in the organization of the Republican party this question of slavery\r\nwas more important than any other: indeed, so much more important has\r\nit become that no more national question can even get a hearing just at\r\npresent. The old question of tariff--a matter that will remain one of the\r\nchief affairs of national house-keeping to all time; the question of the\r\nmanagement of financial affairs; the question of the disposition of the\r\npublic domain how shall it be managed for the purpose of getting it well\r\nsettled, and of making there the homes of a free and happy people? these\r\nwill remain open and require attention for a great while yet, and these\r\nquestions will have to be attended to by whatever party has the control of\r\nthe Government. Yet, just now, they cannot even obtain a hearing, and I do\r\nnot propose to detain you upon these topics or what sort of hearing they\r\nshould have when opportunity shall come.\r\n\r\nFor, whether we will or not, the question of slavery is the question, the\r\nall-absorbing topic of the day. It is true that all of us--and by that I\r\nmean, not the Republican party alone, but the whole American people, here\r\nand elsewhere--all of us wish this question settled, wish it out of the\r\nway. It stands in the way, and prevents the adjustment, and the giving\r\nof necessary attention to other questions of national house-keeping. The\r\npeople of the whole nation agree that this question ought to be settled,\r\nand yet it is not settled. And the reason is that they are not yet agreed\r\nhow it shall be settled. All wish it done, but some wish one way and\r\nsome another, and some a third, or fourth, or fifth; different bodies\r\nare pulling in different directions, and none of them, having a decided\r\nmajority, are able to accomplish the common object.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1854, a new policy was inaugurated with the\r\navowed object and confident promise that it would entirely and forever\r\nput an end to the slavery agitation. It was again and again declared that\r\nunder this policy, when once successfully established, the country would\r\nbe forever rid of this whole question. Yet under the operation of that\r\npolicy this agitation has not only not ceased, but it has been constantly\r\naugmented. And this too, although, from the day of its introduction, its\r\nfriends, who promised that it would wholly end all agitation, constantly\r\ninsisted, down to the time that the Lecompton Bill was introduced, that it\r\nwas working admirably, and that its inevitable tendency was to remove the\r\nquestion forever from the politics of the country. Can you call to mind\r\nany Democratic speech, made after the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,\r\ndown to the time of the Lecompton Bill, in which it was not predicted that\r\nthe slavery agitation was just at an end, that \"the abolition excitement\r\nwas played out,\" \"the Kansas question was dead,\" \"they have made the most\r\nthey can out of this question and it is now forever settled\"? But since\r\nthe Lecompton Bill no Democrat, within my experience, has ever pretended\r\nthat he could see the end. That cry has been dropped. They themselves do\r\nnot pretend, now, that the agitation of this subject has come to an end\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that this question is one of national importance, and we\r\ncannot help dealing with it; we must do something about it, whether\r\nwe will or not. We cannot avoid it; the subject is one we cannot avoid\r\nconsidering; we can no more avoid it than a man can live without eating.\r\nIt is upon us; it attaches to the body politic as much and closely as the\r\nnatural wants attach to our natural bodies. Now I think it important that\r\nthis matter should be taken up in earnest, and really settled: And one way\r\nto bring about a true settlement of the question is to understand its true\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nThere have been many efforts made to settle it. Again and again it has\r\nbeen fondly hoped that it was settled; but every time it breaks out\r\nafresh, and more violently than ever. It was settled, our fathers\r\nhoped, by the Missouri Compromise, but it did not stay settled. Then the\r\ncompromises of 1850 were declared to be a full and final settlement of\r\nthe question. The two great parties, each in national convention, adopted\r\nresolutions declaring that the settlement made by the Compromise of 1850\r\nwas a finality that it would last forever. Yet how long before it was\r\nunsettled again? It broke out again in 1854, and blazed higher and raged\r\nmore furiously than ever before, and the agitation has not rested since.\r\n\r\nThese repeated settlements must have some faults about them. There must\r\nbe some inadequacy in their very nature to the purpose to which they were\r\ndesigned. We can only speculate as to where that fault, that inadequacy,\r\nis, but we may perhaps profit by past experiences.\r\n\r\nI think that one of the causes of these repeated failures is that our best\r\nand greatest men have greatly underestimated the size of this question.\r\nThey have constantly brought forward small cures for great sores--plasters\r\ntoo small to cover the wound. That is one reason that all settlements have\r\nproved temporary--so evanescent.\r\n\r\nLook at the magnitude of this subject: One sixth of our population, in\r\nround numbers--not quite one sixth, and yet more than a seventh,--about\r\none sixth of the whole population of the United States are slaves. The\r\nowners of these slaves consider them property. The effect upon the minds\r\nof the owners is that of property, and nothing else it induces them to\r\ninsist upon all that will favorably affect its value as property, to\r\ndemand laws and institutions and a public policy that shall increase and\r\nsecure its value, and make it durable, lasting, and universal. The effect\r\non the minds of the owners is to persuade them that there is no wrong\r\nin it. The slaveholder does not like to be considered a mean fellow for\r\nholding that species of property, and hence, he has to struggle within\r\nhimself and sets about arguing himself into the belief that slavery is\r\nright. The property influences his mind. The dissenting minister who\r\nargued some theological point with one of the established church was\r\nalways met with the reply, \"I can't see it so.\" He opened a Bible and\r\npointed him a passage, but the orthodox minister replied, \"I can't see\r\nit so.\" Then he showed him a single word--\"Can you see that?\" \"Yes, I see\r\nit,\" was the reply. The dissenter laid a guinea over the word and asked,\r\n\"Do you see it now?\" So here. Whether the owners of this species of\r\nproperty do really see it as it is, it is not for me to say, but if they\r\ndo, they see it as it is through two thousand millions of dollars, and\r\nthat is a pretty thick coating. Certain it is that they do not see it\r\nas we see it. Certain it is that this two thousand millions of dollars,\r\ninvested in this species of property, all so concentrated that the mind\r\ncan grasp it at once--this immense pecuniary interest--has its influence\r\nupon their minds.\r\n\r\nBut here in Connecticut and at the North slavery does not exist, and we\r\nsee it through no such medium.\r\n\r\nTo us it appears natural to think that slaves are human beings; men,\r\nnot property; that some of the things, at least, stated about men in\r\nthe Declaration of Independence apply to them as well as to us. I say we\r\nthink, most of us, that this charter of freedom applies to the slaves as\r\nwell as to ourselves; that the class of arguments put forward to batter\r\ndown that idea are also calculated to break down the very idea of a free\r\ngovernment, even for white men, and to undermine the very foundations of\r\nfree society. We think slavery a great moral wrong, and, while we do not\r\nclaim the right to touch it where it exists, we wish to treat it as a\r\nwrong in the Territories, where our votes will reach it. We think that\r\na respect for ourselves, a regard for future generations and for the God\r\nthat made us, require that we put down this wrong where our votes will\r\nproperly reach it. We think that species of labor an injury to free white\r\nmen--in short, we think slavery a great moral, social, and political\r\nevil, tolerable only because, and so far as, its actual existence makes it\r\nnecessary to tolerate it, and that beyond that it ought to be treated as a\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nNow these two ideas, the property idea that slavery is right, and the\r\nidea that it is wrong, come into collision, and do actually produce that\r\nirrepressible conflict which Mr. Seward has been so roundly abused for\r\nmentioning. The two ideas conflict, and must conflict.\r\n\r\nAgain, in its political aspect, does anything in any way endanger the\r\nperpetuity of this Union but that single thing, slavery? Many of our\r\nadversaries are anxious to claim that they are specially devoted to the\r\nUnion, and take pains to charge upon us hostility to the Union. Now we\r\nclaim that we are the only true Union men, and we put to them this one\r\nproposition: Whatever endangers this Union, save and except slavery? Did\r\nany other thing ever cause a moment's fear? All men must agree that this\r\nthing alone has ever endangered the perpetuity of the Union. But if it\r\nwas threatened by any other influence, would not all men say that the\r\nbest thing that could be done, if we could not or ought not to destroy it,\r\nwould be at least to keep it from growing any larger? Can any man believe,\r\nthat the way to save the Union is to extend and increase the only thing\r\nthat threatens the Union, and to suffer it to grow bigger and bigger?\r\n\r\nWhenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some\r\nphilosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical\r\nopinion can be permanently maintained. And hence there are but two\r\npolicies in regard to slavery that can be at all maintained. The first,\r\nbased on the property view that slavery is right, conforms to that idea\r\nthroughout, and demands that we shall do everything for it that we ought\r\nto do if it were right. We must sweep away all opposition, for opposition\r\nto the right is wrong; we must agree that slavery is right, and we must\r\nadopt the idea that property has persuaded the owner to believe\r\nthat slavery is morally right and socially elevating. This gives a\r\nphilosophical basis for a permanent policy of encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe other policy is one that squares with the idea that slavery is wrong,\r\nand it consists in doing everything that we ought to do if it is wrong.\r\nNow, I don't wish to be misunderstood, nor to leave a gap down to be\r\nmisrepresented, even. I don't mean that we ought to attack it where it\r\nexists. To me it seems that if we were to form a government anew, in view\r\nof the actual presence of slavery we should find it necessary to frame\r\njust such a government as our fathers did--giving to the slaveholder the\r\nentire control where the system was established, while we possessed the\r\npower to restrain it from going outside those limits. From the necessities\r\nof the case we should be compelled to form just such a government as our\r\nblessed fathers gave us; and, surely, if they have so made it, that adds\r\nanother reason why we should let slavery alone where it exists.\r\n\r\nIf I saw a venomous snake crawling in the road, any man would say I might\r\nseize the nearest stick and kill it; but if I found that snake in bed with\r\nmy children, that would be another question. I might hurt the children\r\nmore than the snake, and it might bite them. Much more if I found it\r\nin bed with my neighbor's children, and I had bound myself by a solemn\r\ncompact not to meddle with his children under any circumstances, it would\r\nbecome me to let that particular mode of getting rid of the gentleman\r\nalone. But if there was a bed newly made up, to which the children were to\r\nbe taken, and it was proposed to take a batch of young snakes and put them\r\nthere with them, I take it no man would say there was any question how I\r\nought to decide!\r\n\r\nThat is just the case. The new Territories are the newly made bed to which\r\nour children are to go, and it lies with the nation to say whether they\r\nshall have snakes mixed up with them or not. It does not seem as if there\r\ncould be much hesitation what our policy should be!\r\n\r\nNow I have spoken of a policy based on the idea that slavery is wrong, and\r\na policy based on the idea that it is right. But an effort has been made\r\nfor a policy that shall treat it as neither right nor wrong. It is based\r\nupon utter indifference. Its leading advocate [Douglas] has said, \"I don't\r\ncare whether it be voted up or down.\" \"It is merely a matter of dollars\r\nand cents.\" \"The Almighty has drawn a line across this continent, on one\r\nside of which all soil must forever be cultivated by slave labor, and on\r\nthe other by free.\" \"When the struggle is between the white man and\r\nthe negro, I am for the white man; when it is between the negro and the\r\ncrocodile, I am for the negro.\" Its central idea is indifference. It holds\r\nthat it makes no more difference to us whether the Territories become\r\nfree or slave States than whether my neighbor stocks his farm with horned\r\ncattle or puts in tobacco. All recognize this policy, the plausible\r\nsugar-coated name of which is \"popular sovereignty.\"\r\n\r\nThis policy chiefly stands in the way of a permanent settlement of the\r\nquestion. I believe there is no danger of its becoming the permanent\r\npolicy of the country, for it is based on a public indifference. There is\r\nnobody that \"don't care.\" All the people do care one way or the other! I\r\ndo not charge that its author, when he says he \"don't care,\" states his\r\nindividual opinion; he only expresses his policy for the government. I\r\nunderstand that he has never said as an individual whether he thought\r\nslavery right or wrong--and he is the only man in the nation that has not!\r\nNow such a policy may have a temporary run; it may spring up as necessary\r\nto the political prospects of some gentleman; but it is utterly baseless:\r\nthe people are not indifferent, and it can therefore have no durability or\r\npermanence.\r\n\r\nBut suppose it could: Then it could be maintained only by a public opinion\r\nthat shall say, \"We don't care.\" There must be a change in public opinion;\r\nthe public mind must be so far debauched as to square with this policy\r\nof caring not at all. The people must come to consider this as \"merely\r\na question of dollars and cents,\" and to believe that in some places the\r\nAlmighty has made slavery necessarily eternal. This policy can be brought\r\nto prevail if the people can be brought round to say honestly, \"We don't\r\ncare\"; if not, it can never be maintained. It is for you to say whether\r\nthat can be done.\r\n\r\nYou are ready to say it cannot, but be not too fast! Remember what a long\r\nstride has been taken since the repeal of the Missouri Compromise! Do you\r\nknow of any Democrat, of either branch of the party--do you know one who\r\ndeclares that he believes that the Declaration of Independence has any\r\napplication to the negro? Judge Taney declares that it has not, and Judge\r\nDouglas even vilifies me personally and scolds me roundly for saying that\r\nthe Declaration applies to all men, and that negroes are men. Is there a\r\nDemocrat here who does not deny that the Declaration applies to the\r\nnegro? Do any of you know of one? Well, I have tried before perhaps\r\nfifty audiences, some larger and some smaller than this, to find one such\r\nDemocrat, and never yet have I found one who said I did not place him\r\nright in that. I must assume that Democrats hold that, and now, not one\r\nof these Democrats can show that he said that five years ago! I venture to\r\ndefy the whole party to produce one man that ever uttered the belief\r\nthat the Declaration did not apply to negroes, before the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise! Four or five years ago we all thought negroes were\r\nmen, and that when \"all men\" were named, negroes were included. But the\r\nwhole Democratic party has deliberately taken negroes from the class of\r\nmen and put them in the class of brutes. Turn it as you will it is simply\r\nthe truth! Don't be too hasty, then, in saying that the people cannot be\r\nbrought to this new doctrine, but note that long stride. One more as long\r\ncompletes the journey from where negroes are estimated as men to where\r\nthey are estimated as mere brutes--as rightful property!\r\n\r\nThat saying \"In the struggle between white men and the negro,\" etc., which\r\nI know came from the same source as this policy--that saying marks another\r\nstep. There is a falsehood wrapped up in that statement. \"In the struggle\r\nbetween the white man and the negro\" assumes that there is a struggle,\r\nin which either the white man must enslave the negro or the negro must\r\nenslave the white. There is no such struggle! It is merely the ingenious\r\nfalsehood to degrade and brutalize the negro. Let each let the other\r\nalone, and there is no struggle about it. If it was like two wrecked\r\nseamen on a narrow plank, when each must push the other off or drown\r\nhimself, I would push the negro off or a white man either, but it is not;\r\nthe plank is large enough for both. This good earth is plenty broad enough\r\nfor white man and negro both, and there is no need of either pushing the\r\nother off.\r\n\r\nSo that saying, \"In the struggle between the negro and the crocodile,\"\r\netc., is made up from the idea that down where the crocodile inhabits, a\r\nwhite man can't labor; it must be nothing else but crocodile or negro; if\r\nthe negro does not the crocodile must possess the earth; in that case he\r\ndeclares for the negro. The meaning of the whole is just this: As a white\r\nman is to a negro, so is a negro to a crocodile; and as the negro may\r\nrightfully treat the crocodile, so may the white man rightfully treat the\r\nnegro. This very dear phrase coined by its author, and so dear that he\r\ndeliberately repeats it in many speeches, has a tendency to still further\r\nbrutalize the negro, and to bring public opinion to the point of utter\r\nindifference whether men so brutalized are enslaved or not. When that time\r\nshall come, if ever, I think that policy to which I refer may prevail. But\r\nI hope the good freemen of this country will never allow it to come, and\r\nuntil then the policy can never be maintained.\r\n\r\nNow consider the effect of this policy. We in the States are not to\r\ncare whether freedom or slavery gets the better, but the people in the\r\nTerritories may care. They are to decide, and they may think what they\r\nplease; it is a matter of dollars and cents! But are not the people of the\r\nTerritories detailed from the States? If this feeling of indifference this\r\nabsence of moral sense about the question prevails in the States, will\r\nit not be carried into the Territories? Will not every man say, \"I don't\r\ncare, it is nothing to me\"? If any one comes that wants slavery, must they\r\nnot say, \"I don't care whether freedom or slavery be voted up or voted\r\ndown\"? It results at last in nationalizing the institution of slavery.\r\nEven if fairly carried out, that policy is just as certain to nationalize\r\nslavery as the doctrine of Jeff Davis himself. These are only two roads\r\nto the same goal, and \"popular sovereignty\" is just as sure and almost as\r\nshort as the other.\r\n\r\nWhat we want, and all we want, is to have with us the men who think\r\nslavery wrong. But those who say they hate slavery, and are opposed to it,\r\nbut yet act with the Democratic party--where are they? Let us apply a\r\nfew tests. You say that you think slavery is wrong, but you denounce all\r\nattempts to restrain it. Is there anything else that you think wrong that\r\nyou are not willing to deal with as wrong? Why are you so careful, so\r\ntender, of this one wrong and no other? You will not let us do a single\r\nthing as if it was wrong; there is no place where you will even allow it\r\nto be called wrong! We must not call it wrong in the free States, because\r\nit is not there, and we must not call it wrong in the slave States,\r\nbecause it is there; we must not call it wrong in politics because that\r\nis bringing morality into politics, and we must not call it wrong in the\r\npulpit because that is bringing politics into religion; we must not bring\r\nit into the Tract Society or the other societies, because those are such\r\nunsuitable places--and there is no single place, according to you, where\r\nthis wrong thing can properly be called wrong!\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will plead that if the people of the slave States should\r\nthemselves set on foot an effort for emancipation, you would wish\r\nthem success, and bid them God-speed. Let us test that: In 1858 the\r\nemancipation party of Missouri, with Frank Blair at their head, tried to\r\nget up a movement for that purpose, and having started a party contested\r\nthe State. Blair was beaten, apparently if not truly, and when the news\r\ncame to Connecticut, you, who knew that Frank Blair was taking hold of\r\nthis thing by the right end, and doing the only thing that you say can\r\nproperly be done to remove this wrong--did you bow your heads in sorrow\r\nbecause of that defeat? Do you, any of you, know one single Democrat that\r\nshowed sorrow over that result? Not one! On the contrary every man threw\r\nup his hat, and hallooed at the top of his lungs, \"Hooray for Democracy!\"\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, the Republicans desire to place this great question of\r\nslavery on the very basis on which our fathers placed it, and no other. It\r\nis easy to demonstrate that \"our fathers, who framed this Government\r\nunder which we live,\" looked on slavery as wrong, and so framed it and\r\neverything about it as to square with the idea that it was wrong, so far\r\nas the necessities arising from its existence permitted. In forming the\r\nConstitution they found the slave trade existing, capital invested in it,\r\nfields depending upon it for labor, and the whole system resting upon\r\nthe importation of slave labor. They therefore did not prohibit the slave\r\ntrade at once, but they gave the power to prohibit it after twenty years.\r\nWhy was this? What other foreign trade did they treat in that way? Would\r\nthey have done this if they had not thought slavery wrong?\r\n\r\nAnother thing was done by some of the same men who framed the\r\nConstitution, and afterwards adopted as their own the act by the first\r\nCongress held under that Constitution, of which many of the framers were\r\nmembers, that prohibited the spread of slavery into Territories. Thus\r\nthe same men, the framers of the Constitution, cut off the supply and\r\nprohibited the spread of slavery, and both acts show conclusively that\r\nthey considered that the thing was wrong.\r\n\r\nIf additional proof is wanted it can be found in the phraseology of the\r\nConstitution. When men are framing a supreme law and chart of government,\r\nto secure blessings and prosperity to untold generations yet to come, they\r\nuse language as short and direct and plain as can be found, to express\r\ntheir meaning In all matters but this of slavery the framers of the\r\nConstitution used the very clearest, shortest, and most direct language.\r\nBut the Constitution alludes to slavery three times without mentioning it\r\nonce The language used becomes ambiguous, roundabout, and mystical. They\r\nspeak of the \"immigration of persons,\" and mean the importation of slaves,\r\nbut do not say so. In establishing a basis of representation they say \"all\r\nother persons,\" when they mean to say slaves--why did they not use\r\nthe shortest phrase? In providing for the return of fugitives they say\r\n\"persons held to service or labor.\" If they had said slaves it would have\r\nbeen plainer, and less liable to misconstruction. Why did n't they do it?\r\nWe cannot doubt that it was done on purpose. Only one reason is possible,\r\nand that is supplied us by one of the framers of the Constitution--and\r\nit is not possible for man to conceive of any other--they expected and\r\ndesired that the system would come to an end, and meant that when it did,\r\nthe Constitution should not show that there ever had been a slave in this\r\ngood free country of ours.\r\n\r\nI will dwell on that no longer. I see the signs of approaching triumph\r\nof the Republicans in the bearing of their political adversaries. A great\r\ndeal of their war with us nowadays is mere bushwhacking. At the battle\r\nof Waterloo, when Napoleon's cavalry had charged again and again upon\r\nthe unbroken squares of British infantry, at last they were giving up\r\nthe attempt, and going off in disorder, when some of the officers in mere\r\nvexation and complete despair fired their pistols at those solid squares.\r\nThe Democrats are in that sort of extreme desperation; it is nothing else.\r\nI will take up a few of these arguments.\r\n\r\nThere is \"the irrepressible conflict.\" How they rail at Seward for that\r\nsaying! They repeat it constantly; and, although the proof has been thrust\r\nunder their noses again and again that almost every good man since the\r\nformation of our Government has uttered that same sentiment, from General\r\nWashington, who \"trusted that we should yet have a confederacy of free\r\nStates,\" with Jefferson, Jay, Monroe, down to the latest days, yet they\r\nrefuse to notice that at all, and persist in railing at Seward for saying\r\nit. Even Roger A. Pryor, editor of the Richmond Enquirer, uttered the same\r\nsentiment in almost the same language, and yet so little offence did\r\nit give the Democrats that he was sent for to Washington to edit the\r\nStates--the Douglas organ there--while Douglas goes into hydrophobia and\r\nspasms of rage because Seward dared to repeat it. This is what I call\r\nbushwhacking, a sort of argument that they must know any child can see\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nAnother is John Brown: \"You stir up insurrections, you invade the South;\r\nJohn Brown! Harper's Ferry!\" Why, John Brown was not a Republican!\r\nYou have never implicated a single Republican in that Harper's Ferry\r\nenterprise. We tell you that if any member of the Republican party is\r\nguilty in that matter, you know it or you do not know it. If you do know\r\nit, you are inexcusable not to designate the man and prove the fact. If\r\nyou do not know it, you are inexcusable to assert it, and especially\r\nto persist in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the\r\nproof. You need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does\r\nnot know to be true is simply malicious slander. Some of you admit that no\r\nRepublican designedly aided or encouraged the Harper's Ferry affair, but\r\nstill insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such\r\nresults. We do not believe it. We know we hold to no doctrines, and make\r\nno declarations, which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed\r\nthe Government 'under which we live, and we cannot see how declarations\r\nthat were patriotic when they made them are villainous when we make them.\r\nYou never dealt fairly by us in relation to that affair--and I will say\r\nfrankly that I know of nothing in your character that should lead us to\r\nsuppose that you would. You had just been soundly thrashed in elections\r\nin several States, and others were soon to come. You rejoiced at the\r\noccasion, and only were troubled that there were not three times as many\r\nkilled in the affair. You were in evident glee; there was no sorrow for\r\nthe killed nor for the peace of Virginia disturbed; you were rejoicing\r\nthat by charging Republicans with this thing you might get an advantage of\r\nus in New York, and the other States. You pulled that string as tightly as\r\nyou could, but your very generous and worthy expectations were not quite\r\nfulfilled. Each Republican knew that the charge was a slander as to\r\nhimself at least, and was not inclined by it to cast his vote in your\r\nfavor. It was mere bushwhacking, because you had nothing else to do. You\r\nare still on that track, and I say, go on! If you think you can slander\r\na woman into loving you or a man into voting for you, try it till you are\r\nsatisfied!\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of this bushwhacking, that \"shoe strike.\" Now be it\r\nunderstood that I do not pretend to know all about the matter. I am merely\r\ngoing to speculate a little about some of its phases. And at the outset, I\r\nam glad to see that a system of labor prevails in New England under which\r\nlaborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to\r\nwork under all circumstances, and are not tied down and obliged to labor\r\nwhether you pay them or not! I like the system which lets a man quit when\r\nhe wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere. One of the reasons why\r\nI am opposed to slavery is just here. What is the true condition of the\r\nlaborer? I take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to\r\nacquire property as fast as he can. Some will get wealthy. I don't believe\r\nin a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than\r\ngood. So, while we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to\r\nallow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else.\r\nWhen one starts poor, as most do in the race of life, free society is such\r\nthat he knows he can better his condition; he knows that there is no fixed\r\ncondition of labor for his whole life. I am not ashamed to confess that\r\ntwenty-five years ago I was a hired laborer, mauling rails, at work on a\r\nflatboat--just what might happen to any poor man's son! I want every man\r\nto have a chance--and I believe a Black man is entitled to it--in which he\r\ncan better his condition; when he may look forward and hope to be a hired\r\nlaborer this year and the next, work for himself afterward, and finally to\r\nhire men to work for him! That is the system. Up here in New England, you\r\nhave a soil that scarcely sprouts black-eyed beans, and yet where will you\r\nfind wealthy men so wealthy, and poverty so rarely in extremity? There is\r\nnot another such place on earth! I desire that if you get too thick here,\r\nand find it hard to better your condition on this soil, you may have a\r\nchance to strike and go somewhere else, where you may not be degraded, nor\r\nhave your families corrupted, by forced rivalry with negro slaves. I want\r\nyou to have a clean bed and no snakes in it! Then you can better your\r\ncondition, and so it may go on and on in one endless round so long as man\r\nexists on the face of the earth!\r\n\r\nNow, to come back to this shoe strike,--if, as the senator from Illinois\r\nasserts, this is caused by withdrawal of Southern votes, consider\r\nbriefly how you will meet the difficulty. You have done nothing, and have\r\nprotested that you have done nothing, to injure the South. And yet, to get\r\nback the shoe trade, you must leave off doing something which you are\r\nnow doing. What is it? You must stop thinking slavery wrong! Let your\r\ninstitutions be wholly changed; let your State constitutions be subverted;\r\nglorify slavery, and so you will get back the shoe trade--for what? You\r\nhave brought owned labor with it, to compete with your own labor, to\r\nunderwork you, and to degrade you! Are you ready to get back the trade on\r\nthose terms?\r\n\r\nBut the statement is not correct. You have not lost that trade; orders\r\nwere never better than now! Senator Mason, a Democrat, comes into the\r\nSenate in homespun, a proof that the dissolution of the Union has actually\r\nbegun! but orders are the same. Your factories have not struck work,\r\nneither those where they make anything for coats, nor for pants nor\r\nfor shirts, nor for ladies' dresses. Mr. Mason has not reached the\r\nmanufacturers who ought to have made him a coat and pants! To make his\r\nproof good for anything he should have come into the Senate barefoot!\r\n\r\nAnother bushwhacking contrivance; simply that, nothing else! I find a good\r\nmany people who are very much concerned about the loss of Southern trade.\r\nNow either these people are sincere or they are not. I will speculate a\r\nlittle about that. If they are sincere, and are moved by any real danger\r\nof the loss of Southern trade, they will simply get their names on the\r\nwhite list, and then, instead of persuading Republicans to do likewise,\r\nthey will be glad to keep you away! Don't you see that they cut off\r\ncompetition? They would not be whispering around to Republicans to come\r\nin and share the profits with them. But if they are not sincere, and are\r\nmerely trying to fool Republicans out of their votes, they will grow very\r\nanxious about your pecuniary prospects; they are afraid you are going to\r\nget broken up and ruined; they do not care about Democratic votes, oh, no,\r\nno, no! You must judge which class those belong to whom you meet: I leave\r\nit to you to determine from the facts.\r\n\r\nLet us notice some more of the stale charges against Republicans. You say\r\nwe are sectional. We deny it. That makes an issue; and the burden of proof\r\nis upon you. You produce your proof; and what is it? Why, that our party\r\nhas no existence in your section--gets no votes in your section. The fact\r\nis substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If it does, then in\r\ncase we should, without change of principle, begin to get votes in your\r\nsection, we should thereby cease to be sectional. You cannot escape this\r\nconclusion; and yet, are you willing to abide by it? If you are, you will\r\nprobably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional, for we shall get\r\nvotes in your section this very year. The fact that we get no votes in\r\nyour section is a fact of your making and not of ours. And if there be\r\nfault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours, and remains so until\r\nyou show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice. If we\r\n ours; but this brings you to where you ought to have started--to a\r\ndiscussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If our principle, put\r\nin practice, would wrong your section for the benefit of ours, or for any\r\nother object, then our principle, and we with it, are sectional, and are\r\njustly opposed and denounced as such. Meet us, then, on the question of\r\nwhether our principle put in practice would wrong your section; and so\r\nmeet it as if it were possible that something may be said on our side. Do\r\nyou accept the challenge? No? Then you really believe that the principle\r\nwhich our fathers who framed the Government under which we live thought so\r\nclearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and again, upon their\r\nofficial oaths, is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand our condemnation\r\nwithout a moment's consideration. Some of you delight to flaunt in our\r\nfaces the warning against sectional parties given by Washington in his\r\nFarewell Address. Less than eight years before Washington gave that\r\nwarning, he had, as President of the United States, approved and signed an\r\nact of Congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern\r\nTerritory, which act embodied the policy of government upon that subject,\r\nup to and at the very moment he penned that warning; and about one year\r\nafter he penned it he wrote La Fayette that he considered that prohibition\r\na wise measure, expressing in the same connection his hope that we should\r\nsometime have a confederacy of free States.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon\r\nthis same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or\r\nin our hands against you? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast\r\nthe blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon\r\nyou, who repudiate it? We respect that warning of Washington, and we\r\ncommend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right\r\napplication of it.\r\n\r\nBut you say you are conservative--eminently conservative--while we\r\nare revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort. What is\r\nconservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new\r\nand untried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the\r\npoint in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the\r\nGovernment under which we live; while you with one accord reject and scout\r\nand spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new.\r\n\r\nTrue, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be.\r\nYou have considerable variety of new propositions and plans, but you are\r\nunanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some\r\nof you are for reviving the foreign slave-trade; some for a congressional\r\nslave code for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the\r\nTerritories to prohibit slavery within their limits; some for maintaining\r\nslavery in the Territories through the judiciary; some for the \"gur-reat\r\npur-rinciple\" that if one man would enslave another, no third man should\r\nobject--fantastically called \"popular sovereignty.\" But never a man among\r\nyou in favor of prohibition of slavery in Federal Territories, according\r\nto the practice of our fathers who framed the Government under which\r\nwe live. Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an\r\nadvocate in the century within which our Government originated. And yet\r\nyou draw yourselves up and say, \"We are eminently conservative.\"\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall\r\nbe at peace, and in harmony one with another. Let us Republicans do our\r\npart to have it so. Even though much provoked, let us do nothing through\r\npassion and ill-temper. Even though the Southern people will not so much\r\nas listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them\r\nif, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can. Judging by all\r\nthey say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with\r\nus, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them.\r\n\r\nWill they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered\r\nto them? We know they will not. In all their present complaints against\r\nus, the Territories are scarcely mentioned. Invasions and insurrections\r\nare the rage now. Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing\r\nto do with invasions and insurrections? We know it will not. We so\r\nknow because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and\r\ninsurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the\r\ncharge and the denunciation.\r\n\r\nThe question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply this: we must not only\r\nlet them alone, but we must, somehow, convince them that we do let them\r\nalone. This, we know by experience, is no easy task. We have been so\r\ntrying to convince them, from the very beginning of our organization, but\r\nwith no success. In all our platforms and speeches, we have constantly\r\nprotested our purpose to let them alone; but this had no tendency to\r\nconvince them. Alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they\r\nhave never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them.\r\n\r\nThese natural and apparently adequate means all failing, what will\r\nconvince them? This, and this only: cease to call slavery wrong, and join\r\nthem in calling it right. And this must be done thoroughly--done in\r\nacts as well as in words. Silence will not be tolerated--we must place\r\nourselves avowedly with them. Douglas's new sedition law must be enacted\r\nand enforced, suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong, whether\r\nmade in politics, in presses, in pulpits, or in private. We must arrest\r\nand return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure. We must pull down\r\nour free State constitutions. The whole atmosphere must be disinfected of\r\nall taint of opposition to slavery, before they will cease to believe\r\nthat all their troubles proceed from us. So long as we call slavery wrong,\r\nwhenever a slave runs away they will overlook the obvious fact that he ran\r\naway because he was oppressed, and declare he was stolen off. Whenever\r\na master cuts his slaves with a lash, and they cry out under it, he will\r\noverlook the obvious fact that the negroes cry out because they are hurt,\r\nand insist that they were put up to it by some rascally abolitionist.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware that they do not state their case precisely in this way.\r\nMost of them would probably say to us, \"Let us alone, do nothing to us,\r\nand say what you please about slavery.\" But we do let them alone--have\r\nnever disturbed them--so that, after all, it is what we say which\r\ndissatisfies them. They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we\r\ncease saying.\r\n\r\nI am also aware that they have not as yet in terms demanded the overthrow\r\nof our free-State constitutions. Yet those constitutions declare the wrong\r\nof slavery with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it;\r\nand when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow\r\nof these constitutions will be demanded. It is nothing to the contrary\r\nthat they do not demand the whole of this just now. Demanding what they\r\ndo, and for the reason they do, they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of\r\nthis consummation. Holding as they do that slavery is morally right,\r\nand socially elevating, they cannot cease to demand a full national\r\nrecognition of it, as a legal right, and a social blessing.\r\n\r\nNor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction\r\nthat slavery is wrong. If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and\r\nconstitutions against it are themselves wrong and should be silenced\r\nand swept away. If it is right, we cannot justly object to its\r\nnationality--its universality: if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist\r\nupon its extension--its enlargement. All they ask, we could readily grant,\r\nif we thought slavery right; all we ask, they could as readily grant, if\r\nthey thought it wrong. Their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong\r\nis the precise fact on which depends the whole controversy. Thinking it\r\nright as they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition,\r\nas being right; but, thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them?\r\nCan we cast our votes with their view, and against our own? In view of our\r\nmoral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?\r\n\r\nWrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where\r\nit is because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual\r\npresence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow\r\nit to spread into the national Territories, and to overrun us here in\r\nthese free States?\r\n\r\nIf our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty,\r\nfearlessly and effectively. Let us be diverted by none of those\r\nsophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and\r\nbelabored--contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the\r\nright and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who would be neither a\r\nliving man nor a dead man--such as a policy of \"don't care\" on a question\r\nabout which all free men do care--such as Union appeals beseeching true\r\nUnion men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and caning,\r\nnot the sinners, but the righteous to repentance--such as invocations of\r\nWashington, imploring men to unsay what Washington did.\r\n\r\nNeither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us,\r\nnor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government, nor\r\nof dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might; and in\r\nthat faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.\r\n\r\n[As Mr. Lincoln concluded his address, there was witnessed the wildest\r\nscene of enthusiasm and excitement that has been in New Haven for years.\r\nThe Palladium editorially says: \"We give up most of our space to-day to\r\na very full report of the eloquent speech of the HON.

With\r\nme, as with yourself, the long struggle has been one of great pecuniary\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nI now distinctly say this--if you shall be appointed a delegate to\r\nChicago, I will furnish one hundred dollars to bear the expenses of the\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

SOMERS, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Reaching home three days ago, I found your letter of February\r\n26th. Considering your difficulty of hearing, I think you had better\r\nsettle in Chicago, if, as you say, a good man already in fair practice\r\nthere will take you into partnership. If you had not that difficulty, I\r\nstill should think it an even balance whether you would not better remain\r\nin Chicago, with such a chance for copartnership.\r\n\r\nIf I went west, I think I would go to Kansas, to Leavenworth or Atchison.\r\nBoth of them are and will continue to be fine growing places.\r\n\r\nI believe I have said all I can, and I have said it with the deepest\r\ninterest for your welfare.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCUSATION OF HAVING BEEN PAID FOR A POLITICAL SPEECH\r\n\r\nTO C. F. McNEIL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, April 6, 1860\r\n\r\nC. F. MCNEIL, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Reaching home yesterday, I found yours of the 23d March,\r\ninclosing a slip from The Middleport Press. It is not true that I ever\r\ncharged anything for a political speech in my life; but this much is true:\r\nLast October I was requested by letter to deliver some sort of speech in\r\nMr. Beecher's church, in Brooklyn--two hundred dollars being offered in\r\nthe first letter. I wrote that I could do it in February, provided they\r\nwould take a political speech if I could find time to get up no other.\r\nThey agreed; and subsequently I informed them the speech would have to\r\nbe a political one. When I reached New York, I for the first time learned\r\nthat the place was changed to \"Cooper Institute.\" I made the speech, and\r\nleft for New Hampshire, where I have a son at school, neither asking for\r\npay nor having any offered me. Three days after a check for two hundred\r\ndollars was sent to me at New Hampshire; and I took it, and did not know\r\nit was wrong. My understanding now is--though I knew nothing of it at the\r\ntime--that they did charge for admittance to the Cooper Institute, and\r\nthat they took in more than twice two hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nI have made this explanation to you as a friend; but I wish no explanation\r\nmade to our enemies. What they want is a squabble and a fuss, and that\r\nthey can have if we explain; and they cannot have it if we don't.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned through New York from New England, I was told by the\r\ngentlemen who sent me the Check that a drunken vagabond in the club,\r\nhaving learned something about the two hundred dollars, made the\r\nexhibition out of which The Herald manufactured the article quoted by The\r\nPress of your town.\r\n\r\nMy judgment is, and therefore my request is, that you give no denial and\r\nno explanation.\r\n\r\nThanking you for your kind interest in the matter, I remain, Yours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., April 21, 1860.\r\n\r\nHAWKINS TAYLOR, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 15th is just received. It surprises me that you\r\nhave written twice, without receiving an answer. I have answered all I\r\never received from you; and certainly one since my return from the East.\r\n\r\nOpinions here, as to the prospect of Douglas being nominated, are quite\r\nconflicting--some very confident he will, and others that he will not be.\r\nI think his nomination possible, but that the chances are against him.\r\n\r\nI am glad there is a prospect of your party passing this way to Chicago.\r\nWishing to make your visit here as pleasant as we can, we wish you to\r\nnotify us as soon as possible whether you come this way, how many, and\r\nwhen you will arrive.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO A MEMBER OF THE ILLINOIS DELEGATION\r\n\r\nAT THE CHICAGO CONVENTION. SPRINGFIELD, May 17? 1860.\r\n\r\nI authorize no bargains and will be bound by none.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE COMMITTEE SENT BY THE CHICAGO CONVENTION TO INFORM\r\n\r\nLINCOLN OF HIS NOMINATION,\r\n\r\nMAY 19, 1860.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:--I tender to you, and through\r\nyou to the Republican National Convention, and all the people represented\r\nin it, my profoundest thanks for the high honor done me, which you\r\nnow formally announce. Deeply and even painfully sensible of the great\r\nresponsibility which is inseparable from this high honor--a responsibility\r\nwhich I could almost wish had fallen upon some one of the far more eminent\r\nmen and experienced statesmen whose distinguished names were before the\r\nconvention--I shall, by your leave, consider more fully the resolutions of\r\nthe convention, denominated their platform, and without any unnecessary or\r\nunreasonable delay respond to you, Mr. Chairman, in writing--not\r\ndoubting that the platform will be found satisfactory, and the nomination\r\ngratefully accepted.\r\n\r\nAnd now I will not longer defer the pleasure of taking you, and each of\r\nyou, by the hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCEPTANCE OF NOMINATION AS REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ASHMUN AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD ILLINOIS, May 23, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. GEORGE ASHMUN, President of Republican National Convention.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I accept the nomination tendered me by the convention over which you\r\npresided, and of which I am formally apprised in the letter of yourself\r\nand others, acting as a committee of the convention for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of principles and sentiments which accompanies your letter\r\nmeets my approval; and it shall be my care not to violate or disregard it\r\nin any part.\r\n\r\nImploring the assistance of Divine Providence, and with due regard to the\r\nviews and feelings of all who were represented in the convention, to the\r\nrights of all the States and Territories and people of the nation, to the\r\ninviolability of the Constitution, and the perpetual union, harmony, and\r\nprosperity of all--I am most happy to co-operate for the practical success\r\nof the principles declared by the convention.\r\n\r\nYour obliged friend and fellow-citizen,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo C. B. SMITH.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., May 26, 1860.\r\n\r\nHON. C. B. SMITH.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:-Yours of the 21st was duly received, but have found no time\r\nuntil now to say a word in the way of answer. I am indeed much indebted\r\nto Indiana; and, as my home friends tell me, much to you personally. Your\r\nsaying, you no longer consider it a doubtful State is very gratifying. The\r\nthing starts well everywhere--too well, I almost fear, to last. But we are\r\nin, and stick or go through must be the word.\r\n\r\nLet me hear from Indiana occasionally.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORM OF REPLY PREPARED BY MR. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nWITH WHICH HIS PRIVATE SECRETARY WAS INSTRUCTED TO ANSWER A NUMEROUS CLASS\r\nOF LETTERS IN THE CAMPAIGN OF 1860.\r\n\r\n(Doctrine.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, ------, 1860\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your letter to Mr. Lincoln of and by which you seek to obtain\r\nhis opinions on certain political points, has been received by him. He has\r\nreceived others of a similar character, but he also has a greater number\r\nof the exactly opposite character. The latter class beseech him to write\r\nnothing whatever upon any point of political doctrine. They say his\r\npositions were well known when he was nominated, and that he must not now\r\nembarrass the canvass by undertaking to shift or modify them. He regrets\r\nthat he cannot oblige all, but you perceive it is impossible for him to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\nJNO. J. NICOLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, MAY 26, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have several letters from you written since the\r\nnomination, but till now have found no moment to say a word by way of\r\nanswer. Of course I am glad that the nomination is well received by our\r\nfriends, and I sincerely thank you for so informing me. So far as I\r\ncan learn, the nominations start well everywhere; and, if they get no\r\nback-set, it would seem as if they are going through. I hope you will\r\nwrite often; and as you write more rapidly than I do, don't make your\r\nletters so short as mine.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO S. HAYCRAFT.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., June 4, 1860.\r\n\r\nHON. SAMUEL HAYCRAFT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Like yourself I belonged to the old Whig party from its\r\norigin to its close. I never belonged to the American party organization,\r\nnor ever to a party called a Union party; though I hope I neither am\r\nor ever have been less devoted to the Union than yourself or any other\r\npatriotic man.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM OR \"ABRAM\"\r\n\r\nTO G. ASHMUN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. June 4, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. GEORGE ASHMUN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--It seems as if the question whether my first name is\r\n\"Abraham\" or \"Abram\" will never be settled. It is \"Abraham,\" and if the\r\nletter of acceptance is not yet in print, you may, if you think fit, have\r\nmy signature thereto printed \"Abraham Lincoln.\" Exercise your judgment\r\nabout this.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nTO S. GALLOWAY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., June 19, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. SAM'L GALLOWAY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your very kind letter of the 15th is received. Messrs.\r\nFollett, Foster, & Co.'s Life of me is not by my authority; and I\r\nhave scarcely been so much astounded by anything, as by their public\r\nannouncement that it is authorized by me. They have fallen into some\r\nstrange misunderstanding. I certainly knew they contemplated publishing\r\na biography, and I certainly did not object to their doing so, upon their\r\nown responsibility. I even took pains to facilitate them. But, at the same\r\ntime, I made myself tiresome, if not hoarse, with repeating to Mr. Howard,\r\ntheir only agent seen by me, my protest that I authorized nothing--would\r\nbe responsible for nothing. How they could so misunderstand me, passes\r\ncomprehension. As a matter wholly my own, I would authorize no biography,\r\nwithout time and opportunity [sic] to carefully examine and consider every\r\nword of it and, in this case, in the nature of things, I can have no such\r\ntime and Opportunity [sic]. But, in my present position, when, by the\r\nlessons of the past, and the united voice of all discreet friends, I can\r\nneither write nor speak a word for the public, how dare I to send forth,\r\nby my authority, a volume of hundreds of pages, for adversaries to make\r\npoints upon without end? Were I to do so, the convention would have a\r\nright to re-assemble and substitute another name for mine.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I would not look at the proof sheets--I am determined\r\nto maintain the position of [sic] truly saying I never saw the proof\r\nsheets, or any part of their work, before its publication.\r\n\r\nNow, do not mistake me--I feel great kindness for Messrs. F., F., &\r\nCo.--do not think they have intentionally done wrong. There may be nothing\r\nwrong in their proposed book--I sincerely hope there will not. I barely\r\nsuggest that you, or any of the friends there, on the party account, look\r\nit over, and exclude what you may think would embarrass the party bearing\r\nin mind, at all times, that I authorize nothing--will be responsible for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The custom then, and it may have been a good one, was for the\r\nPresidential candidate to do no personal canvassing or speaking--or as we\r\nhave it now \"running for election.\" He stayed at home and kept his mouth\r\nshut.

MY DEAR SIR:--It appears to me that you and I ought\r\nto be acquainted, and accordingly I write this as a sort of introduction\r\nof myself to you. You first entered the Senate during the single term I\r\nwas a member of the House of Representatives, but I have no recollection\r\nthat we were introduced. I shall be pleased to receive a line from you.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of Republican success now appears very flattering, so far as\r\nI can perceive. Do you see anything to the contrary?\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. JONAS.\r\n\r\n(Confidential.) SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, JULY 21, 1860.\r\n\r\nHON. A. JONAS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 20th is received. I suppose as good or even\r\nbetter men than I may have been in American or Know-Nothing lodges; but in\r\npoint of fact, I never was in one at Quincy or elsewhere. I was never\r\nin Quincy but one day and two nights while Know-Nothing lodges were in\r\nexistence, and you were with me that day and both those nights. I had\r\nnever been there before in my life, and never afterward, till the joint\r\ndebate with Douglas in 1858. It was in 1854 when I spoke in some\r\nhall there, and after the speaking, you, with others, took me to an\r\noyster-saloon, passed an hour there, and you walked with me to, and parted\r\nwith me at, the Quincy House, quite late at night. I left by stage for\r\nNaples before daylight in the morning, having come in by the same route\r\nafter dark the evening, previous to the speaking, when I found you waiting\r\nat the Quincy House to meet me. A few days after I was there, Richardson,\r\nas I understood, started this same story about my having been in a\r\nKnow-Nothing lodge. When I heard of the charge, as I did soon after; I\r\ntaxed my recollection for some incident which could have suggested it; and\r\nI remembered that on parting with you the last night I went to the office\r\nof the hotel to take my stage-passage for the morning, was told that no\r\nstage-office for that line was kept there, and that I must see the driver\r\nbefore retiring, to insure his calling for me in the morning; and a\r\nservant was sent with me to find the driver, who, after taking me a square\r\nor two, stopped me, and stepped perhaps a dozen steps farther, and in my\r\nhearing called to some one, who answered him, apparently from the upper\r\npart of a building, and promised to call with the stage for me at the\r\nQuincy House. I returned, and went to bed, and before day the stage called\r\nand took me. This is all.\r\n\r\nThat I never was in a Know-Nothing lodge in Quincy, I should expect could\r\nbe easily proved by respectable men who were always in the lodges and\r\nnever saw me there. An affidavit of one or two such would put the matter\r\nat rest.\r\n\r\nAnd now a word of caution. Our adversaries think they can gain a point\r\nif they could force me to openly deny the charge, by which some degree\r\nof offence would be given to the Americans. For this reason it must not\r\npublicly appear that I am paying any attention to the charge.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN B. FRY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, August 15, 1860.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 9th, inclosing the letter of HON. John Minor\r\nBotts, was duly received. The latter is herewith returned according to\r\nyour request. It contains one of the many assurances I receive from the\r\nSouth, that in no probable event will there be any very formidable effort\r\nto break up the Union. The people of the South have too much of good sense\r\nand good temper to attempt the ruin of the government rather than see it\r\nadministered as it was administered by the men who made it. At least so I\r\nhope and believe. I thank you both for your own letter and a sight of that\r\nof Mr. Botts.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THURLOW WEED\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. August 17 1860.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 13th was received this morning. Douglas\r\nis managing the Bell element with great adroitness. He had his men in\r\nKentucky to vote for the Bell candidate, producing a result which has\r\nbadly alarmed and damaged Breckenridge, and at the same time has induced\r\nthe Bell men to suppose that Bell will certainly be President, if they\r\ncan keep a few of the Northern States away from us by throwing them to\r\nDouglas. But you, better than I, understand all this.\r\n\r\nI think there will be the most extraordinary effort ever made to carry New\r\nYork for Douglas. You and all others who write me from your State think\r\nthe effort cannot succeed, and I hope you are right. Still, it will\r\nrequire close watching and great efforts on the other side.\r\n\r\nHerewith I send you a copy of a letter written at New York, which\r\nsufficiently explains itself, and which may or may not give you a valuable\r\nhint. You have seen that Bell tickets have been put on the track both here\r\nand in Indiana. In both cases the object has been, I think, the same as\r\nthe Hunt movement in New York--to throw States to Douglas. In our State,\r\nwe know the thing is engineered by Douglas men, and we do not believe they\r\ncan make a great deal out of it.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLOW TO LISTEN TO CRIMINATIONS\r\n\r\nTO HON. JOHN ------------\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug. 31, 1860\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 27th is duly received. It consists almost\r\nexclusively of a historical detail of some local troubles, among some\r\nof our friends in Pennsylvania; and I suppose its object is to guard me\r\nagainst forming a prejudice against Mr. McC------____, I have not heard\r\nnear so much upon that subject as you probably suppose; and I am slow to\r\nlisten to criminations among friends, and never expose their quarrels on\r\neither side. My sincere wish is that both sides will allow bygones to be\r\nbygones, and look to the present and future only.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, September 4, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am annoyed some by a letter from a friend in Chicago, in\r\nwhich the following passage occurs: \"Hamlin has written Colfax that two\r\nmembers of Congress will, he fears, be lost in Maine, the first and sixth\r\ndistricts; and that Washburne's majority for governor will not exceed six\r\nthousand.\"\r\n\r\nI had heard something like this six weeks ago, but had been assured since\r\nthat it was not so. Your secretary of state,--Mr. Smith, I think,--whom\r\nyou introduced to me by letter, gave this assurance; more recently, Mr.\r\nFessenden, our candidate for Congress in one of those districts, wrote a\r\nrelative here that his election was sure by at least five thousand, and\r\nthat Washburne's majority would be from 14,000 to 17,000; and still\r\nlater, Mr. Fogg, of New Hampshire, now at New York serving on a national\r\ncommittee, wrote me that we were having a desperate fight in Maine, which\r\nwould end in a splendid victory for us.\r\n\r\nSuch a result as you seem to have predicted in Maine, in your letter to\r\nColfax, would, I fear, put us on the down-hill track, lose us the State\r\nelections in Pennsylvania and Indiana, and probably ruin us on the main\r\nturn in November.\r\n\r\nYou must not allow it.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, September 9, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Yours of the 5th was received last evening. I was right\r\nglad to see it. It contains the freshest \"posting\" which I now have. It\r\nrelieved me some from a little anxiety I had about Maine. Jo Medill, on\r\nAugust 30th, wrote me that Colfax had a letter from Mr. Hamlin saying we\r\nwere in great danger of losing two members of Congress in Maine, and that\r\nyour brother would not have exceeding six thousand majority for Governor.\r\nI addressed you at once, at Galena, asking for your latest information.\r\nAs you are at Washington, that letter you will receive some time after the\r\nMaine election.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., OCTOBER 10, 1860\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--I cannot give you details, but it is entirely certain that\r\nPennsylvania and Indiana have gone Republican very largely. Pennsylvania\r\n25,000, and Indiana 5000 to 10,000. Ohio of course is safe.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO L. M. BOND.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., October 15, 1860\r\n\r\nL. MONTGOMERY BOND, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: I certainly am in no temper and have no purpose to embitter\r\nthe feelings of the South, but whether I am inclined to such a course as\r\nwould in fact embitter their feelings you can better judge by my published\r\nspeeches than by anything I would say in a short letter if I were inclined\r\nnow, as I am not, to define my position anew.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER SUGGESTING A BEARD\r\n\r\nTO MISS GRACE BEDELL, RIPLEY N.Y.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., October 19, 1860\r\n\r\nMISS GRACE BEDELL.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LITTLE MISS:--Your very agreeable letter of the 15th is received.\r\nI regret the necessity of saying I have no daughter. I have three\r\nsons--one seventeen, one nine, and one seven. They with their mother\r\nconstitute my whole family. As to the whiskers, as I have never worn any,\r\ndo you not think that people would call it a piece of silly affectation\r\nwere I to begin wearing them now?\r\n\r\nI am your true friend and sincere well-wisher,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY INFORMATION ON ARMY DEFECTION IN SOUTH\r\n\r\nTO D. HUNTER.\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential.) SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, October 26, 1860\r\n\r\nMAJOR DAVID HUNTER\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your very kind letter of the 20th was duly received, for\r\nwhich please accept my thanks. I have another letter, from a writer\r\nunknown to me, saying the officers of the army at Fort Kearny have\r\ndetermined in case of Republican success at the approaching Presidential\r\nelection, to take themselves, and the arms at that point, south, for the\r\npurpose of resistance to the government. While I think there are many\r\nchances to one that this is a humbug, it occurs to me that any real\r\nmovement of this sort in the Army would leak out and become known to you.\r\nIn such case, if it would not be unprofessional or dishonorable (of which\r\nyou are to be judge), I shall be much obliged if you will apprise me of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN\r\n\r\n(Confidential.) SPRINGFIELD. ILLINOIS, November 8, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am anxious for a personal interview with you at as early a\r\nday as possible. Can you, without much inconvenience, meet me at Chicago?\r\nIf you can, please name as early a day as you conveniently can, and\r\ntelegraph me, unless there be sufficient time before the day named to\r\ncommunicate by mail.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL HAYCRAFT.\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Nov.13, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. SAMUEL HAYCRAFT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 9th is just received. I can only answer\r\nbriefly. Rest fully assured that the good people of the South who will put\r\nthemselves in the same temper and mood towards me which you do will find\r\nno cause to complain of me.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCELEBRATION OF LINCOLN'S ELECTION,\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT THE MEETING AT SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 20, 1860\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--Please excuse me on this occasion from\r\nmaking a speech. I thank you in common with all those who have thought fit\r\nby their votes to indorse the Republican cause. I rejoice with you in the\r\nsuccess which has thus far attended that cause. Yet in all our rejoicings\r\nlet us neither express nor cherish any hard feelings toward any citizen\r\nwho by his vote has differed with us. Let us at all times remember that\r\nall American citizens are brothers of a common country, and should dwell\r\ntogether in the bonds of fraternal feeling. Let me again beg you to accept\r\nmy thanks, and to excuse me from further speaking at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. NOV. 30, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. A. H. STEPHENS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have read in the newspapers your speech recently delivered\r\n(I think) before the Georgia Legislature, or its assembled members. If you\r\nhave revised it, as is probable, I shall be much obliged if you will send\r\nme a copy.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN\r\n\r\n(Private)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 8, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 4th was duly received. The inclosed to Governor\r\nSeward covers two notes to him, copies of which you find open for your\r\ninspection. Consult with Judge Trumbull; and if you and he see no reason\r\nto the contrary, deliver the letter to Governor Seward at once. If you see\r\nreason to the contrary write me at once.\r\n\r\nI have an intimation that Governor Banks would yet accept a place in the\r\nCabinet. Please ascertain and write me how this is,\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOCKING \"COMPROMISE\" ON SLAVERY ISSUE\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., December 13, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your long letter received. Prevent, as far as possible, any\r\nof our friends from demoralizing themselves and our cause by entertaining\r\npropositions for compromise of any sort on \"slavery extension.\" There is\r\nno possible compromise upon it but which puts us under again, and leaves\r\nall our work to do over again. Whether it be a Missouri line or Eli\r\nThayer's popular sovereignty, it is all the same. Let either be done, and\r\nimmediately filibustering and extending slavery recommences. On that point\r\nhold firm, as with a chain of steel.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINION ON SECESSION\r\n\r\nTO THURLOW WEED\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, DECEMBER 17, 1860\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 11th was received two days ago. Should the\r\nconvocation of governors of which you speak seem desirous to know my views\r\non the present aspect of things, tell them you judge from my speeches that\r\nI will be inflexible on the territorial question; but I probably think\r\neither the Missouri line extended, or Douglas's and Eli Thayer's popular\r\nsovereignty would lose us everything we gain by the election; that\r\nfilibustering for all south of us and making slave States of it would\r\nfollow in spite of us, in either case; also that I probably think all\r\nopposition, real and apparent, to the fugitive slave clause of the\r\nConstitution ought to be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nI believe you can pretend to find but little, if anything, in my speeches,\r\nabout secession. But my opinion is that no State can in any way lawfully\r\nget out of the Union without the consent of the others; and that it is\r\nthe duty of the President and other government functionaries to run the\r\nmachine as it is.\r\n\r\nTruly yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME FORTS SURRENDERED TO THE SOUTH\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE\r\n\r\n(Confidential)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 21, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Last night I received your letter giving an account of your\r\ninterview with General Scott, and for which I thank you. Please present my\r\nrespects to the General, and tell him, confidentially, I shall be obliged\r\nto him to be as well prepared as he can to either hold or retake the\r\nforts, as the case may require, at and after the inauguration.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. H. STEPHENS.\r\n\r\n(For your own eye only) SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, DECEMBER 22, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. ALEXANDER STEVENS\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your obliging answer to my short note is just received, and\r\nfor which please accept my thanks. I fully appreciate the present peril\r\nthe country is in, and the weight of responsibility on me. Do the people\r\nof the South really entertain fear that a Republican administration would,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, interfere with the slaves, or with them about the\r\nslaves? If they do, I wish to assure you, as once a friend, and still, I\r\nhope, not an enemy, that there is no cause for such fears. The South\r\nwould be in no more danger in this respect than it was in the days of\r\nWashington. I suppose, however, this does not meet the case. You think\r\nslavery is right and ought to be extended, while we think it is wrong and\r\nought to be restricted. That, I suppose, is the rub. It certainly is the\r\nonly substantial difference between us.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPORT OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE CLAUSE\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nDecember [22?], 1860\r\n\r\nResolved: That the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution ought to be\r\nenforced by a law of Congress, with efficient provisions for that object,\r\nnot obliging private persons to assist in its execution, but punishing all\r\nwho resist it, and with the usual safeguards to liberty, securing free men\r\nagainst being surrendered as slaves.\r\n\r\nThat all State laws, if there be such, really or apparently in conflict\r\nwith such law of Congress, ought to be repealed; and no opposition to the\r\nexecution of such law of Congress ought to be made.\r\n\r\nThat the Federal Union must be preserved.\r\n\r\nPrepared for the consideration of the Republican members of the Senate\r\nCommittee of Thirteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO D. HUNTER.\r\n\r\n(Confidential.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS December 22, 1860\r\n\r\nMAJOR DAVID HUNTER.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am much obliged by the receipt of yours of the 18th. The\r\nmost we can do now is to watch events, and be as well prepared as possible\r\nfor any turn things may take. If the forts fall, my judgment is that they\r\nare to be retaken. When I shall determine definitely my time of starting\r\nto Washington, I will notify you.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO I. N. MORRIS\r\n\r\n(Confidential.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Dec 24, 1860\r\n\r\nHON. I. N. MORRIS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Without supposing that you and I are any nearer together,\r\npolitically, than heretofore, allow me to tender you my sincere thanks for\r\nyour Union resolution, expressive of views upon which we never were, and,\r\nI trust, never will be at variance.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATTEMPT TO FORM A COALITION CABINET\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 14, 1860.\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I need a man of Democratic antecedents from New England. I\r\ncannot get a fair share of that element in without. This stands in the way\r\nof Mr. Adams. I think of Governor Banks, Mr. Welles, and Mr. Tuck. Which\r\nof them do the New England delegation prefer? Or shall I decide for\r\nmyself?\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1861\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD. ILL., January 3, 1861.\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours without signature was received last night. I have been\r\nconsidering your suggestions as to my reaching Washington somewhat earlier\r\nthan is usual. It seems to me the inauguration is not the most dangerous\r\npoint for us. Our adversaries have us now clearly at disadvantage on the\r\nsecond Wednesday of February, when the votes should be officially counted.\r\nIf the two houses refuse to meet at all, or meet without a quorum of each,\r\nwhere shall we be? I do not think that this counting is constitutionally\r\nessential to the election, but how are we to proceed in the absence of\r\nit? In view of this, I think it is best for me not to attempt appearing in\r\nWashington till the result of that ceremony is known.\r\n\r\nIt certainly would be of some advantage if you could know who are to be\r\nat the heads of the War and Navy departments, but until I can ascertain\r\ndefinitely whether I can get any suitable men from the South, and who, and\r\nhow many, I can not well decide. As yet, I have no word from Mr. Gilmer\r\nin answer to my request for an interview with him. I look for something on\r\nthe subject, through you, before long.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., January 12, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 8th received. I still hope Mr. Gilmer will, on\r\na fair understanding with us, consent to take a place in the Cabinet. The\r\npreference for him over Mr. Hunt or Mr. Gentry is that, up to date--he\r\nhas a living position in the South, while they have not. He is only better\r\nthan Winter Davis in that he is farther south. I fear, if we could get, we\r\ncould not safely take more than one such man--that is, not more than one\r\nwho opposed us in the election--the danger being to lose the confidence\r\nof our own friends. Your selection for the State Department having become\r\npublic, I am happy to find scarcely any objection to it. I shall have\r\ntrouble with every other Northern Cabinet appointment--so much so that I\r\nshall have to defer them as long as possible to avoid being teased into\r\ninsanity, to make changes.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. D. MORGAN\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL. FEB. 4, 1861\r\n\r\nSIR:--Your letter of the 30th ult. inviting me, on behalf of the\r\nLegislature of New York, to pass through that State on my way to\r\nWashington, and tendering me the hospitalities of her authorities and\r\npeople, has been duly received. With the feelings of deep gratitude to\r\nyou and them for this testimonial of regard and esteem I beg you to notify\r\nthem that I accept the invitation so kindly tendered.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nP.S.--Please let the ceremonies be only such as to take the least time\r\npossible. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRONAGE CLAIMS\r\n\r\nTO THURLOW WEED\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., February 4, 1861\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I have both your letter to myself and that to Judge Davis,\r\nin relation to a certain gentleman in your State claiming to dispense\r\npatronage in my name, and also to be authorized to use my name to advance\r\nthe chances of Mr. Greeley for an election to the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nIt is very strange that such things should be said by any one. The\r\ngentleman you mention did speak to me of Mr. Greeley in connection with\r\nthe senatorial election, and I replied in terms of kindness toward Mr.\r\nGreeley, which I really feel, but always with an expressed protest that\r\nmy name must not be used in the senatorial election in favor of or against\r\nany one. Any other representation of me is a misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nAs to the matter of dispensing patronage, it perhaps will surprise you\r\nto learn that I have information that you claim to have my authority to\r\narrange that matter in New York. I do not believe you have so claimed; but\r\nstill so some men say. On that subject you know all I have said to you is\r\n\"justice to all,\" and I have said nothing more particular to any one. I\r\nsay this to reassure you that I have not changed my position.\r\n\r\nIn the hope, however, that you will not use my name in the matter, I am,\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAREWELL ADDRESS AT SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 11, 1861\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS:--One who has never been placed in a like position cannot\r\nunderstand my feelings at this hour, nor the oppressive sadness I feel at\r\nthis parting. For more than twenty-five years I have lived among you, and\r\nduring all that time I have received nothing but kindness at your hands.\r\nHere the most cherished ties of earth were assumed. Here my children were\r\nborn, and here one of them lies buried. To you, my friends, I owe all that\r\nI have, all that I am. All the strange checkered past seems to crowd upon\r\nmy mind. To-day I leave you. I go to assume a task more difficult than\r\nthat which devolved upon General Washington. Unless the great God who\r\nassisted him shall be with and aid me I cannot prevail; but if the same\r\nalmighty arm that directed and protected him shall guide and support me I\r\nshall not fail; I shall succeed. Let us pray that the God of our fathers\r\nmay not forsake us now. To Him I commend you all. Permit me to ask that\r\nwith equal sincerity and faith you will all invoke His wisdom and goodness\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nWith these words I must leave you; for how long I know not. Friends, one\r\nand all, I must now wish you an affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT TOLONO, ILLINOIS, FEBRUARY 11, 1861\r\n\r\nI am leaving you on an errand of national importance, attended, as you are\r\naware, with considerable difficulties. Let us believe, as some poet has\r\nexpressed it, \"Behind the cloud the sun is still shining.\" I bid you an\r\naffectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO ADDRESS OF WELCOME, INDIANAPOLIS,\r\n\r\nINDIANA, FEBRUARY 11, 1861\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR MORTON AND FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF INDIANA:\r\n\r\nMost heartily do I thank you for this magnificent reception, and while\r\nI cannot take to myself any share of the compliment thus paid, more\r\nthan that which pertains to a mere instrument, an accidental instrument,\r\nperhaps I should say, of a great cause, I yet must look upon it as a most\r\nmagnificent reception, and as such most heartily do thank you for it.\r\nYou have been pleased to address yourself to me chiefly in behalf of\r\nthis glorious Union in which we live, in all of which you have my hearty\r\nsympathy, and, as far as may be within my power, will have, one and\r\ninseparable, my hearty consideration. While I do not expect, upon this\r\noccasion, or until I get to Washington, to attempt any lengthy speech,\r\nI will only say to the salvation of the Union there needs but one single\r\nthing--the hearts of a people like yours.\r\n\r\nThe people--when they rise in mass in behalf of the Union and the\r\nliberties of their country, truly may it be said, \"The gates of hell\r\ncannot prevail against them.\" In all trying positions in which I shall be\r\nplaced--and, doubtless, I shall be placed in many such--my reliance will\r\nbe placed upon you and the people of the United States; and I wish you to\r\nremember, now and forever, that it is your business, and not mine; that if\r\nthe union of these States and the liberties of this people shall be lost,\r\nit is but little to any one man of fifty-two years of age, but a great\r\ndeal to the thirty millions of people who inhabit these United States, and\r\nto their posterity in all coming time. It is your business to rise up and\r\npreserve the Union and liberty for yourselves, and not for me.\r\n\r\nI desire they should be constitutionally performed. I, as already\r\nintimated, am but an accidental instrument, temporary, and to serve but\r\nfor a limited time; and I appeal to you again to constantly bear in mind\r\nthat with you, and not with politicians, not with Presidents, not with\r\noffice-seekers, but with you is the question, Shall the Union and shall\r\nthe liberties of this country be preserved to the latest generations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE LEGISLATURE OF INDIANA, AT INDIANAPOLIS,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 12, 1861\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF INDIANA:--I am here to thank you much for\r\nthis magnificent welcome, and still more for the generous support given\r\nby your State to that political cause which I think is the true and just\r\ncause of the whole country and the whole world.\r\n\r\nSolomon says there is \"a time to keep silence,\" and when men wrangle by\r\nthe mouth with no certainty that they mean the same thing while using the\r\nsame word, it perhaps were as well if they would keep silence.\r\n\r\nThe words \"coercion\" and \"invasion\" are much used in these days, and often\r\nwith some temper and hot blood. Let us make sure, if we can, the meaning\r\nof those who use them. Let us get the exact definitions of these words,\r\nnot from dictionaries, but from the men themselves, who certainly\r\ndeprecate the things they would represent by the use of the words.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is coercion? What is invasion? Would the marching of an army\r\ninto South Carolina, without the consent of her people, and with hostile\r\nintent toward them, be invasion? I certainly think it would, and it would\r\nbe coercion also, if the South Carolinians were forced to submit. But if\r\nthe United States should merely hold and retake its own forts and other\r\nproperty, and collect the duties on foreign importations, or even withhold\r\nthe mails from places where they were habitually violated, would any or\r\nall of these things be invasion or coercion? Do our professed lovers\r\nof the Union, who spitefully resolve that they will resist coercion and\r\ninvasion, understand that such things as these, on the part of the United\r\nStates, would be coercion or invasion of a State? If so, their idea of\r\nmeans to preserve the object of their great affection would seem to be\r\nexceedingly thin and airy. If sick, the little pills of the homoeopathist\r\nwould be much too large for it to swallow. In their view, the Union, as a\r\nfamily relation, would seem to be no regular marriage, but rather a sort\r\nof \"free-love\" arrangement, to be maintained on passional attraction.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in what consists the special sacredness of a State? I speak\r\nnot of the position assigned to a State in the Union by the Constitution,\r\nfor that is a bond we all recognize. That position, however, a State\r\ncannot carry out of the Union with it. I speak of that assumed primary\r\nright of a State to rule all which is less than itself, and to ruin all\r\nwhich is larger than itself. If a State and a county, in a given case,\r\nshould be equal in number of inhabitants, in what, as a matter of\r\nprinciple, is the State better than the county? Would an exchange of\r\nname be an exchange of rights? Upon what principle, upon what rightful\r\nprinciple, may a State, being no more than one fiftieth part of the\r\nnation in soil and population, break up the nation, and then coerce a\r\nproportionably large subdivision of itself in the most arbitrary way? What\r\nmysterious right to play tyrant is conferred on a district of country,\r\nwith its people, by merely calling it a State? Fellow-citizens, I am not\r\nasserting anything. I am merely asking questions for you to consider. And\r\nnow allow me to bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTENTIONS TOWARD THE SOUTH\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE MAYOR AND CITIZENS OF\r\n\r\nCINCINNATI, OHIO, FEBRUARY 12, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. MAYOR, AND GENTLEMEN:--Twenty-four hours ago, at the capital of\r\nIndiana, I said to myself, \"I have never seen so many people assembled\r\ntogether in winter weather.\" I am no longer able to say that. But it\r\nis what might reasonably have been expected--that this great city of\r\nCincinnati would thus acquit herself on such an occasion. My friends, I am\r\nentirely overwhelmed by the magnificence of the reception which has been\r\ngiven, I will not say to me, but to the President-elect of the United\r\nStates of America. Most heartily do I thank you, one and all, for it.\r\n\r\nI have spoken but once before this in Cincinnati. That was a year previous\r\nto the late Presidential election. On that occasion, in a playful\r\nmanner, but with sincere words, I addressed much of what I said to the\r\nKentuckians. I gave my opinion that we, as Republicans, would ultimately\r\nbeat them as Democrats, but that they could postpone that result longer by\r\nnominating Senator Douglas for the Presidency than they could by any other\r\nway. They did not, in any true sense of the word, nominate Mr. Douglas,\r\nand the result has come certainly as soon as ever I expected. I also told\r\nthem how I expected they would be treated after they should have been\r\nbeaten, and I now wish to call their attention to what I then said upon\r\nthat subject. I then said:\r\n\r\n\"When we do as we say, beat you, you perhaps want to know what we will\r\ndo with you. I will tell you, as far as I am authorized to speak for the\r\nOpposition, what we mean to do with you. We mean to treat you, as near\r\nas we possibly can, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison treated you.\r\nWe mean to leave you alone, and in no way to interfere with your\r\ninstitutions; to abide by all and every compromise of the Constitution,\r\nand, in a word, coming back to the original proposition, to treat you\r\nso far as degenerate men, if we have degenerated, may, according to the\r\nexample of those noble fathers, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison.\r\n\r\n\"We mean to remember that you are as good as we; that there is no\r\ndifference between us other than the difference of circumstances. We mean\r\nto recognize and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in\r\nyour bosoms as other people, or as we claim to have, and treat you\r\naccordingly.\"\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens of Kentucky--friends and brethren, may I call you in my\r\nnew position?--I see no occasion and feel no inclination to retract a word\r\nof this. If it shall not be made good, be assured the fault shall not be\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE GERMAN CLUB OF CINCINNATI, OHIO,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 12, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN:--I thank you and those whom you represent for the compliment\r\nyou have paid me by tendering me this address. In so far as there is an\r\nallusion to our present national difficulties, which expresses, as you\r\nhave said, the views of the gentlemen present, I shall have to beg pardon\r\nfor not entering fully upon the questions which the address you have now\r\nread suggests.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty--a duty which I owe to my constituents--to you,\r\ngentlemen, that I should wait until the last moment for a development of\r\nthe present national difficulties before I express myself decidedly as to\r\nwhat course I shall pursue. I hope, then, not to be false to anything that\r\nyou have expected of me.\r\n\r\nI agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that the working men are the basis of all\r\ngovernments, for the plain reason that they are all the more numerous,\r\nand as you added that those were the sentiments of the gentlemen present,\r\nrepresenting not only the working class, but citizens of other callings\r\nthan those of the mechanic, I am happy to concur with you in these\r\nsentiments, not only of the native-born citizens, but also of the Germans\r\nand foreigners from other countries.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, I hold that while man exists it is his duty to improve not\r\nonly his own condition, but to assist in ameliorating the condition of\r\nmankind; and therefore, without entering upon the details of the question,\r\nI will simply say that I am for those means which will give the greatest\r\ngood to the greatest number.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Homestead law, I have to say that, in so far as the\r\ngovernment lands can be disposed of, I am in favor of cutting up the wild\r\nlands into parcels, so that every poor man may have a home.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Germans and foreigners, I esteem them no better than\r\nother people, nor any worse. It is not my nature, when I see a people\r\nborne down by the weight of their shackles--the oppression of tyranny--to\r\nmake their life more bitter by heaping upon them greater burdens; but\r\nrather would I do all in my power to raise the yoke than to add anything\r\nthat would tend to crush them.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as our own country is extensive and new, and the countries of\r\nEurope are densely populated, if there are any abroad who desire to make\r\nthis the land of their adoption, it is not in my heart to throw aught in\r\ntheir way to prevent them from coming to the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and gentlemen, I will bid you an affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE LEGISLATURE OF OHIO AT COLUMBUS\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 13, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT AND Mr. SPEAKER, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF\r\nOHIO:--It is true, as has been said by the president of the Senate, that\r\nvery great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the\r\nvotes of the American people have called me. I am deeply sensible of that\r\nweighty responsibility. I cannot but know what you all know, that without\r\na name, perhaps without a reason why I should have a name, there has\r\nfallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the Father of his\r\nCountry; and so feeling, I can turn and look for that support without\r\nwhich it will be impossible for me to perform that great task. I turn,\r\nthen, and look to the American people and to that God who has never\r\nforsaken them. Allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to\r\nthe policy of the new administration. In this I have received from some\r\na degree of credit for having kept silence, and from others some\r\ndeprecation. I still think that I was right.\r\n\r\nIn the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present, and without\r\na precedent which could enable me to judge by the past, it has seemed\r\nfitting that before speaking upon the difficulties of the country I should\r\nhave gained a view of the whole field, being at liberty to modify and\r\nchange the course of policy as future events may make a change necessary.\r\n\r\nI have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety. It is a\r\ngood thing that there is no more than anxiety, for there is nothing going\r\nwrong. It is a consoling circumstance that when we look out there is\r\nnothing that really hurts anybody. We entertain different views upon\r\npolitical questions, but nobody is suffering anything. This is a most\r\nconsoling circumstance, and from it we may conclude that all we want is\r\ntime, patience, and a reliance on that God who has never forsaken this\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, what I have said I have said altogether extemporaneously,\r\nand I will now come to a close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT STEUBENVILLE, OHIO,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 14, 1861\r\n\r\nI fear that the great confidence placed in my ability is unfounded.\r\nIndeed, I am sure it is. Encompassed by vast difficulties as I am, nothing\r\nshall be wanting on my part, if sustained by God and the American people.\r\nI believe the devotion to the Constitution is equally great on both sides\r\nof the river. It is only the different understanding of that instrument\r\nthat causes difficulty. The only dispute on both sides is, \"What are their\r\nrights?\" If the majority should not rule, who would be the judge? Where\r\nis such a judge to be found? We should all be bound by the majority of\r\nthe American people; if not, then the minority must control. Would that be\r\nright? Would it be just or generous? Assuredly not. I reiterate that\r\nthe majority should rule. If I adopt a wrong policy, the opportunity for\r\ncondemnation will occur in four years' time. Then I can be turned out, and\r\na better man with better views put in my place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 15, 1861\r\n\r\nI most cordially thank his Honor Mayor Wilson, and the citizens of\r\nPittsburg generally, for their flattering reception. I am the more\r\ngrateful because I know that it is not given to me alone, but to the cause\r\nI represent, which clearly proves to me their good-will, and that sincere\r\nfeeling is at the bottom of it. And here I may remark that in every short\r\naddress I have made to the people, in every crowd through which I have\r\npassed of late, some allusion has been made to the present distracted\r\ncondition of the country. It is natural to expect that I should say\r\nsomething on this subject; but to touch upon it at all would involve\r\nan elaborate discussion of a great many questions and circumstances,\r\nrequiring more time than I can at present command, and would, perhaps,\r\nunnecessarily commit me upon matters which have not yet fully developed\r\nthemselves. The condition of the country is an extraordinary one, and\r\nfills the mind of every patriot with anxiety. It is my intention to\r\ngive this subject all the consideration I possibly can before specially\r\ndeciding in regard to it, so that when I do speak it may be as nearly\r\nright as possible. When I do speak I hope I may say nothing in opposition\r\nto the spirit of the Constitution, contrary to the integrity of the Union,\r\nor which will prove inimical to the liberties of the people, or to the\r\npeace of the whole country. And furthermore, when the time arrives for me\r\nto speak on this great subject, I hope I may say nothing to disappoint the\r\npeople generally throughout the country, especially if the expectation has\r\nbeen based upon anything which I may have heretofore said. Notwithstanding\r\nthe troubles across the river [the speaker pointing southwardly across the\r\nMonongahela, and smiling], there is no crisis but an artificial one. What\r\nis there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends\r\nover the river? Take even their own view of the questions involved, and\r\nthere is nothing to justify the course they are pursuing. I repeat, then,\r\nthere is no crisis, excepting such a one as may be gotten up at any time\r\nby turbulent men aided by designing politicians, My advice to them, under\r\nsuch circumstances, is to keep cool. If the great American people only\r\nkeep their temper on both sides of the line, the troubles will come to\r\nan end, and the question which now distracts the country will be settled,\r\njust as surely as all other difficulties of a like character which have\r\noriginated in this government have been adjusted. Let the people on both\r\nsides keep their self-possession, and just as other clouds have cleared\r\naway in due time, so will this great nation continue to prosper as\r\nheretofore. But, fellow-citizens, I have spoken longer on this subject\r\nthan I intended at the outset.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that the tariff is the specialty of Pennsylvania.\r\nAssuming that direct taxation is not to be adopted, the tariff question\r\nmust be as durable as the government itself. It is a question of national\r\nhousekeeping. It is to the government what replenishing the meal-tub is\r\nto the family. Every varying circumstances will require frequent\r\nmodifications as to the amount needed and the sources of supply. So\r\nfar there is little difference of opinion among the people. It is as to\r\nwhether, and how far, duties on imports shall be adjusted to favor home\r\nproduction in the home market, that controversy begins. One party insists\r\nthat such adjustment oppresses one class for the advantage of another;\r\nwhile the other party argues that, with all its incidents, in the long run\r\nall classes are benefited. In the Chicago platform there is a plank upon\r\nthis subject which should be a general law to the incoming administration.\r\nWe should do neither more nor less than we gave the people reason\r\nto believe we would when they gave us their votes. Permit me,\r\nfellow-citizens, to read the tariff plank of the Chicago platform, or\r\nrather have it read in your hearing by one who has younger eyes.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Lincoln's private secretary then read Section 12 of the Chicago\r\nplatform, as follows:]\r\n\r\n\"That, while providing revenue for the support of the General Government\r\nby duties upon imports, sound policy requires such an adjustment of these\r\nimposts as will encourage the development of the industrial interest of\r\nthe whole country; and we commend that policy of national exchanges which\r\nsecures to working-men liberal wages, to agriculture remunerating prices,\r\nto mechanics and manufacturers adequate return for their skill, labor, and\r\nenterprise, and to the nation commercial prosperity and independence.\"\r\n\r\nAs with all general propositions, doubtless, there will be shades of\r\ndifference in construing this. I have by no means a thoroughly matured\r\njudgment upon this subject, especially as to details; some general ideas\r\nare about all. I have long thought it would be to our advantage to produce\r\nany necessary article at home which can be made of as good quality and\r\nwith as little labor at home as abroad, at least by the difference of the\r\ncarrying from abroad. In such case the carrying is demonstrably a dead\r\nloss of labor. For instance, labor being the true standard of value, is it\r\nnot plain that if equal labor get a bar of railroad iron out of a mine in\r\nEngland and another out of a mine in Pennsylvania, each can be laid down\r\nin a track at home cheaper than they could exchange countries, at least\r\nby the carriage? If there be a present cause why one can be both made\r\nand carried cheaper in money price than the other can be made without\r\ncarrying, that cause is an unnatural and injurious one, and ought\r\ngradually, if not rapidly, to be removed. The condition of the treasury\r\nat this time would seem to render an early revision of the tariff\r\nindispensable. The Morrill [tariff] bill, now pending before Congress, may\r\nor may not become a law. I am not posted as to its particular provisions,\r\nbut if they are generally satisfactory, and the bill shall now pass, there\r\nwill be an end for the present. If, however, it shall not pass, I suppose\r\nthe whole subject will be one of the most pressing and important for the\r\nnext Congress. By the Constitution, the executive may recommend measures\r\nwhich he may think proper, and he may veto those he thinks improper, and\r\nit is supposed that he may add to these certain indirect influences to\r\naffect the action of Congress. My political education strongly inclines me\r\nagainst a very free use of any of these means by the executive to control\r\nthe legislation of the country. As a rule, I think it better that Congress\r\nshould originate as well as perfect its measures without external bias. I\r\ntherefore would rather recommend to every gentleman who knows he is to be\r\na member of the next Congress to take an enlarged view, and post himself\r\nthoroughly, so as to contribute his part to such an adjustment of the\r\ntariff as shall produce a sufficient revenue, and in its other bearings,\r\nso far as possible, be just and equal to all sections of the country and\r\nclasses of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT CLEVELAND, OHIO,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 15, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF CLEVELAND:--We have been marching\r\nabout two miles through snow, rain, and deep mud. The large numbers that\r\nhave turned out under these circumstances testify that you are in earnest\r\nabout something or other. But do I think so meanly of you as to suppose\r\nthat that earnestness is about me personally? I would be doing you an\r\ninjustice to suppose you did. You have assembled to testify your respect\r\nfor the Union, the Constitution, and the laws; and here let me say that it\r\nis with you, the people, to advance the great cause of the Union and the\r\nConstitution, and not with any one man. It rests with you alone. This fact\r\nis strongly impressed upon my mind at present. In a community like this,\r\nwhose appearance testifies to their intelligence, I am convinced that the\r\ncause of liberty and the Union can never be in danger. Frequent allusion\r\nis made to the excitement at present existing in our national politics,\r\nand it is as well that I should also allude to it here. I think that\r\nthere is no occasion for any excitement. 'The crisis, as it is called,\r\nis altogether an artificial crisis. In all parts of the nation there are\r\ndifferences of opinion on politics. There are differences of opinion even\r\nhere. You did not all vote for the person who now addresses you. What is\r\nhappening now will not hurt those who are farther away from here. Have\r\nthey not all their rights now as they ever have had? Do they not have\r\ntheir fugitive slaves returned now as ever? Have they not the same\r\nConstitution that they have lived under for seventy-odd years? Have they\r\nnot a position as citizens of this common country, and have we any power\r\nto change that position? What, then, is the matter with them? Why all this\r\nexcitement? Why all these complaints?\r\n\r\nAs I said before, this crisis is all artificial! It has no foundation in\r\nfacts. It is not argued up, as the saying is, and cannot, therefore, be\r\nargued down. Let it alone and it will go down of itself.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Lincoln then said that they must be content with a few words from\r\nhim, as he was tired, etc. Having been given to understand that the\r\ncrowd was not all Republican, but consisted of men of all parties, he\r\ncontinued:]\r\n\r\nThis is as it should be. If Judge Douglas had been elected and had been\r\nhere on his way to Washington, as I am to-night, the Republicans should\r\nhave joined his supporters in welcoming him, just as his friends have\r\njoined with mine tonight. If all do not join now to save the good old\r\nship of the Union this voyage, nobody will have a chance to pilot her on\r\nanother voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT BUFFALO, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 16, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. MAYOR AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF BUFFALO AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK:--I\r\nam here to thank you briefly for this grand reception given to me, not\r\npersonally, but as the representative of our great and beloved country.\r\nYour worthy mayor has been pleased to mention, in his address to me, the\r\nfortunate and agreeable journey which I have had from home, on my rather\r\ncircuitous route to the Federal capital. I am very happy that he was\r\nenabled in truth to congratulate myself and company on that fact. It is\r\ntrue we have had nothing thus far to mar the pleasure of the trip. We have\r\nnot been met alone by those who assisted in giving the election to me--I\r\nsay not alone by them, but by the whole population of the country through\r\nwhich we have passed. This is as it should be. Had the election fallen\r\nto any other of the distinguished candidates instead of myself, under the\r\npeculiar circumstances, to say the least, it would have been proper for\r\nall citizens to have greeted him as you now greet me. It is an evidence of\r\nthe devotion of the whole people to the Constitution, the Union, and\r\nthe perpetuity of the liberties of this country. I am unwilling on any\r\noccasion that I should be so meanly thought of as to have it supposed for\r\na moment that these demonstrations are tendered to me personally. They are\r\ntendered to the country, to the institutions of the country, and to the\r\nperpetuity of the liberties of the country, for which these institutions\r\nwere made and created.\r\n\r\nYour worthy mayor has thought fit to express the hope that I may be able\r\nto relieve the country from the present, or, I should say, the threatened\r\ndifficulties. I am sure I bring a heart true to the work. For the ability\r\nto perform it, I must trust in that Supreme Being who has never forsaken\r\nthis favored land, through the instrumentality of this great and\r\nintelligent people. Without that assistance I shall surely fail; with it,\r\nI cannot fail. When we speak of threatened difficulties to the Country,\r\nit is natural that it should be expected that something should be said by\r\nmyself with regard to particular measures. Upon more mature reflection,\r\nhowever, others will agree with me that, when it is considered that these\r\ndifficulties are without precedent, and have never been acted upon by any\r\nindividual situated as I am, it is most proper I should wait and see the\r\ndevelopments, and get all the light possible, so that when I do speak\r\nauthoritatively, I may be as near right as possible. When I shall speak\r\nauthoritatively, I hope to say nothing inconsistent with the Constitution,\r\nthe Union, the rights of all the States, of each State, and of each\r\nsection of the country, and not to disappoint the reasonable expectations\r\nof those who have confided to me their votes. In this connection allow me\r\nto say that you, as a portion of the great American people, need only to\r\nmaintain your composure, stand up to your sober convictions of right, to\r\nyour obligations to the Constitution, and act in accordance with those\r\nsober convictions, and the clouds now on the horizon will be dispelled,\r\nand we shall have a bright and glorious future; and when this generation\r\nhas passed away, tens of thousands will inhabit this country where only\r\nthousands inhabit it now. I do not propose to address you at length; I\r\nhave no voice for it. Allow me again to thank you for this magnificent\r\nreception, and bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT ROCHESTER, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1861\r\n\r\nI confess myself, after having seen many large audiences since leaving\r\nhome, overwhelmed with this vast number of faces at this hour of the\r\nmorning. I am not vain enough to believe that you are here from any\r\nwish to see me as an individual, but because I am for the time being the\r\nrepresentative of the American people. I could not, if I would, address\r\nyou at any length. I have not the strength, even if I had the time, for a\r\nspeech at each of these many interviews that are afforded me on my way to\r\nWashington. I appear merely to see you, and to let you see me, and to\r\nbid you farewell. I hope it will be understood that it is from no\r\ndisinclination to oblige anybody that I do not address you at greater\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT SYRACUSE, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I See you have erected a very fine and handsome\r\nplatform here for me, and I presume you expected me to speak from it. If\r\nI should go upon it, you would imagine that I was about to deliver you\r\na much longer speech than I am. I wish you to understand that I mean no\r\ndiscourtesy to you by thus declining. I intend discourtesy to no one.\r\nBut I wish you to understand that, though I am unwilling to go upon this\r\nplatform, you are not at liberty to draw inferences concerning any other\r\nplatform with which my name has been or is connected. I wish you long life\r\nand prosperity individually, and pray that with the perpetuity of those\r\ninstitutions under which we have all so long lived and prospered, our\r\nhappiness may be secured, our future made brilliant, and the glorious\r\ndestiny of our country established forever. I bid you a kind farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT UTICA, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1860\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I have no speech to make to you; and no time to\r\nspeak in. I appear before you that I may see you, and that you may see me;\r\nand I am willing to admit that so far as the ladies are concerned I have\r\nthe best of the bargain, though I wish it to be understood that I do not\r\nmake the same acknowledgment concerning the men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MAYOR OF ALBANY, NEW YORK\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR:--I can hardly appropriate to myself the flattering terms in\r\nwhich you communicate the tender of this reception, as personal to myself.\r\nI most gratefully accept the hospitalities tendered to me, and will not\r\ndetain you or the audience with any extended remarks at this time. I\r\npresume that in the two or three courses through which I shall have to go,\r\nI shall have to repeat somewhat, and I will therefore only express to you\r\nmy thanks for this kind reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO GOVERNOR MORGAN OF NEW YORK, AT ALBANY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR MORGAN:--I was pleased to receive an invitation to visit the\r\ncapital of the great Empire State of this nation while on my way to the\r\nFederal capital. I now thank you, Mr. Governor, and you, the people of\r\nthe capital of the State of New York, for this most hearty and magnificent\r\nwelcome. If I am not at fault, the great Empire State at this time\r\ncontains a larger population than did the whole of the United States of\r\nAmerica at the time they achieved their national independence, and I was\r\nproud--to be invited to visit its capital, to meet its citizens, as I now\r\nhave the honor to do. I am notified by your governor that this reception\r\nis tendered by citizens without distinction of party. Because of this\r\nI accept it the more gladly. In this country, and in any country where\r\nfreedom of thought is tolerated, citizens attach themselves to political\r\nparties. It is but an ordinary degree of charity to attribute this act to\r\nthe supposition that, in thus attaching themselves to the various parties,\r\neach man in his own judgment supposes he thereby best advances the\r\ninterests of the whole country. And when an election is past it is\r\naltogether befitting a free people, as I suppose, that, until the next\r\nelection, they should be one people. The reception you have extended me\r\nto-day is not given to me personally,--it should not be so,--but as the\r\nrepresentative, for the time being, of the majority of the nation. If the\r\nelection had fallen to any of the more distinguished citizens who received\r\nthe support of the people, this same honor should have greeted him that\r\ngreets me this day, in testimony of the universal, unanimous devotion\r\nof the whole people to the Constitution, the Union, and to the perpetual\r\nliberties of succeeding generations in this country.\r\n\r\nI have neither the voice nor the strength to address you at any greater\r\nlength. I beg you will therefore accept my most grateful thanks for this\r\nmanifest devotion--not to me, but the institutions of this great and\r\nglorious country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE LEGISLATURE OF NEW YORK, AT ALBANY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF NEW\r\nYORK:--It is with feelings of great diffidence, and, I may say, with\r\nfeelings of awe, perhaps greater than I have recently experienced, that I\r\nmeet you here in this place. The history of this great State, the renown\r\nof those great men who have stood here, and have spoken here, and have\r\nbeen heard here, all crowd around my fancy, and incline me to shrink from\r\nany attempt to address you. Yet I have some confidence given me by the\r\ngenerous manner in which you have invited me, and by the still more\r\ngenerous manner in which you have received me, to speak further. You\r\nhave invited and received me without distinction of party. I cannot for\r\na moment suppose that this has been done in any considerable degree with\r\nreference to my personal services, but that it is done in so far as I am\r\nregarded, at this time, as the representative of the majesty of this great\r\nnation. I doubt not this is the truth, and the whole truth of the case,\r\nand this is as it should be. It is much more gratifying to me that this\r\nreception has been given to me as the elected representative of a free\r\npeople, than it could possibly be if tendered merely as an evidence of\r\ndevotion to me, or to any one man personally.\r\n\r\nAnd now I think it were more fitting that I should close these hasty\r\nremarks. It is true that, while I hold myself, without mock modesty,\r\nthe humblest of all individuals that have ever been elevated to the\r\nPresidency, I have a more difficult task to perform than any one of them.\r\n\r\nYou have generously tendered me the support--the united support--of the\r\ngreat Empire State. For this, in behalf of the nation--in behalf of the\r\npresent and future of the nation--in behalf of civil and religious liberty\r\nfor all time to come, most gratefully do I thank you. I do not propose\r\nto enter into an explanation of any particular line of policy, as to our\r\npresent difficulties, to be adopted by the incoming administration. I deem\r\nit just to you, to myself, to all, that I should see everything, that I\r\nshould hear everything, that I should have every light that can be brought\r\nwithin my reach, in order that, when I do so speak, I shall have enjoyed\r\nevery opportunity to take correct and true ground; and for this reason I\r\ndo not propose to speak at this time of the policy of the Government. But\r\nwhen the time comes, I shall speak, as well as I am able, for the good of\r\nthe present and future of this country for the good both of the North and\r\nof the South--for the good of the one and the other, and of all sections\r\nof the country. In the meantime, if we have patience, if we restrain\r\nourselves, if we allow ourselves not to run off in a passion, I still have\r\nconfidence that the Almighty, the Maker of the universe, will, through\r\nthe instrumentality of this great and intelligent people, bring us through\r\nthis as He has through all the other difficulties of our country. Relying\r\non this, I again thank you for this generous reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT TROY, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR AND CITIZENS OF TROY:--I thank you very kindly for this great\r\nreception. Since I left my home it has not been my fortune to meet\r\nan assemblage more numerous and more orderly than this. I am the more\r\ngratified at this mark of your regard since you assure me it is tendered,\r\nnot to the individual but to the high office you have called me to fill.\r\nI have neither strength nor time to make any extended remarks on this\r\noccasion, and I can only repeat to you my sincere thanks for the kind\r\nreception you have thought proper to extend to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT POUGHKEEPSIE, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--It is altogether impossible I should make myself heard\r\nby any considerable portion of this vast assemblage; but, although I\r\nappear before you mainly for the purpose of seeing you, and to let you\r\nsee rather than hear me, I cannot refrain from saying that I am highly\r\ngratified--as much here, indeed, under the circumstances, as I have been\r\nanywhere on my route--to witness this noble demonstration--made, not\r\nin honor of an individual, but of the man who at this time humbly, but\r\nearnestly, represents the majesty of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis reception, like all the others that have been tendered to me,\r\ndoubtless emanates from all the political parties, and not from one alone.\r\nAs such I accept it the more gratefully, since it indicates an earnest\r\ndesire on the part of the whole people, with out regard to political\r\ndifferences, to save--not the country, because the country will save\r\nitself but to save the institutions of the country, those institutions\r\nunder which, in the last three quarters of a century, we have grown to\r\na great, and intelligent, and a happy people--the greatest, the\r\nmost intelligent, and the happiest people in the world. These noble\r\nmanifestations indicate, with unerring certainty, that the whole people\r\nare willing to make common cause for this object; that if, as it ever must\r\nbe, some have been successful in the recent election and some have been\r\nbeaten, if some are satisfied and some are dissatisfied, the defeated\r\nparty are not in favor of sinking the ship, but are desirous of running it\r\nthrough the tempest in safety, and willing, if they think the people have\r\ncommitted an error in their verdict now, to wait in the hope of reversing\r\nit and setting it right next time. I do not say that in the recent\r\nelection the people did the wisest thing, that could have been\r\ndone--indeed, I do not think they did; but I do say that in accepting the\r\ngreat trust committed to me, which I do with a determination to endeavor\r\nto prove worthy of it, I must rely upon you, upon the people of the whole\r\ncountry, for support; and with their sustaining aid, even I, humble as I\r\nam, cannot fail to carry the ship of state safely through the storm.\r\n\r\nI have now only to thank you warmly for your kind attendance, and bid you\r\nall an affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT HUDSON, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1860\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I see that you are providing a platform for me. I shall\r\nhave to decline standing upon it, because the president of the company\r\ntells me that I shall not have time to wait until it is brought to me. As\r\nI said yesterday, under similar circumstances at another gathering, you\r\nmust not draw the inference that I have any intention of deserting any\r\nplatform with which I have a legitimate connection because I do not stand\r\non yours. Allow me to thank you for this splendid reception, and I now bid\r\nyou farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT PEEKSKILL, NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I have but a moment to stand before you to listen\r\nto and return your kind greeting. I thank you for this reception, and for\r\nthe pleasant manner in which it is tendered to me by our mutual friends.\r\nI will say in a single sentence, in regard to the difficulties that lie\r\nbefore me and our beloved country, that if I can only be as generously and\r\nunanimously sustained as the demonstrations I have witnessed indicate I\r\nshall be, I shall not fail; but without your sustaining hands I am sure\r\nthat neither I nor any other man can hope to surmount these difficulties.\r\nI trust that in the course I shall pursue I shall be sustained not only\r\nby the party that elected me, but by the patriotic people of the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT FISHKILL LANDING\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I appear before you not to make a speech. I have\r\nnot sufficient time, if I had the strength, to repeat speeches at every\r\nstation where the people kindly gather to welcome me as we go along. If I\r\nhad the strength, and should take the time, I should not get to Washington\r\nuntil after the inauguration, which you must be aware would not fit\r\nexactly. That such an untoward event might not transpire, I know you will\r\nreadily forego any further remarks; and I close by bidding you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT THE ASTOR HOUSE, NEW YORK CITY, FEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I have stepped before you merely in compliance with what\r\nappears to be your wish, and not with the purpose of making a speech. I\r\ndo not propose making a speech this afternoon. I could not be heard by any\r\nbut a small fraction of you, at best; but, what is still worse than that,\r\nI have nothing just now to say that is worthy of your hearing. I beg you\r\nto believe that I do not now refuse to address you from any disposition to\r\ndisoblige you, but to the contrary. But, at the same time, I beg of you to\r\nexcuse me for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT NEW YORK CITY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN:--I am rather an old man to avail myself of\r\nsuch an excuse as I am now about to do. Yet the truth is so distinct, and\r\npresses itself so distinctly upon me, that I cannot well avoid it--and\r\nthat is, that I did not understand when I was brought into this room that\r\nI was to be brought here to make a speech. It was not intimated to me that\r\nI was brought into the room where Daniel Webster and Henry Clay had made\r\nspeeches, and where one in my position might be expected to do something\r\nlike those men or say something worthy of myself or my audience. I\r\ntherefore beg you to make allowance for the circumstances in which I\r\nhave been by surprise brought before you. Now I have been in the habit\r\nof thinking and sometimes speaking upon political questions that have for\r\nsome years past agitated the country; and, if I were disposed to do so,\r\nand we could take up some one of the issues, as the lawyers call them, and\r\nI were called upon to make an argument about it to the best of my ability,\r\nI could do so without much preparation. But that is not what you desire to\r\nhave done here to-night.\r\n\r\nI have been occupying a position, since the Presidential election, of\r\nsilence--of avoiding public speaking, of avoiding public writing. I have\r\nbeen doing so because I thought, upon full consideration, that was the\r\nproper course for me to take. I am brought before you now, and required\r\nto make a speech, when you all approve more than anything else of the fact\r\nthat I have been keeping silence. And now it seems to me that the response\r\nyou give to that remark ought to justify me in closing just here. I\r\nhave not kept silence since the Presidential election from any party\r\nwantonness, or from any indifference to the anxiety that pervades the\r\nminds of men about the aspect of the political affairs of this country. I\r\nhave kept silence for the reason that I supposed it was peculiarly proper\r\nthat I should do so until the time came when, according to the custom of\r\nthe country, I could speak officially.\r\n\r\nI still suppose that, while the political drama being enacted in this\r\ncountry at this time is rapidly shifting its scenes--forbidding an\r\nanticipation with any degree of certainty to-day of what we shall see\r\nto-morrow--it is peculiarly fitting that I should see it all, up to the\r\nlast minute, before I should take ground that I might be disposed, by the\r\nshifting of the scenes afterward, also to shift. I have said several times\r\nupon this journey, and I now repeat it to you, that when the time does\r\ncome, I shall then take the ground that I think is right--right for the\r\nNorth, for the South, for the East, for the West, for the whole country.\r\nAnd in doing so I hope to feel no necessity pressing upon me to say\r\nanything in conflict with the Constitution, in conflict with the continued\r\nunion of these States, in conflict with the perpetuation of the liberties\r\nof this people, or anything in conflict with anything whatever that I have\r\never given you reason to expect from me. And now, my friends, have I said\r\nenough? [Loud cries of \"No, no!\" and, \"Three cheers for LINCOLN!\"] Now, my\r\nfriends, there appears to be a difference of opinion between you and me,\r\nand I really feel called upon to decide the question myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 20, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. MAYOR:--It is with feelings of deep gratitude that I make my\r\nacknowledgments for the reception that has been given me in the great\r\ncommercial city of New York. I cannot but remember that it is done by\r\nthe people who do not, by a large majority, agree with me in political\r\nsentiment. It is the more grateful to me because in this I see that for\r\nthe great principles of our Government the people are pretty nearly or\r\nquite unanimous. In regard to the difficulties that confront us at this\r\ntime, and of which you have seen fit to speak so becomingly and so justly,\r\nI can only say I agree with the sentiments expressed. In my devotion to\r\nthe Union I hope I am behind no man in the nation. As to my wisdom in\r\nconducting affairs so as to tend to the preservation of the Union, I fear\r\ntoo great confidence may have been placed in me. I am sure I bring a\r\nheart devoted to the work. There is nothing that could ever bring me to\r\nconsent--willingly to consent--to the destruction of this Union (in which\r\nnot only the great city of New York, but the whole country, has acquired\r\nits greatness), unless it would be that thing for which the Union\r\nitself was made. I understand that the ship is made for the carrying and\r\npreservation of the cargo; and so long as the ship is safe with the cargo,\r\nit shall not be abandoned. This Union shall never be abandoned, unless the\r\npossibility of its existence shall cease to exist without the necessity of\r\nthrowing passengers and cargo overboard. So long, then, as it is possible\r\nthat the prosperity and liberties of this people can be preserved within\r\nthis Union, it shall be my purpose at all tunes to preserve it. And now,\r\nMr. Mayor, renewing my thanks for this cordial reception, allow me to come\r\nto a close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1860\r\n\r\nMR. DAYTON AND GENTLEMEN OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY:--I shall only thank\r\nyou briefly for this very kind reception given me, not personally, but as\r\nthe temporary representative of the majesty of the nation. To the kindness\r\nof your hearts, and of the hearts of your brethren in your State, I should\r\nbe very proud to respond, but I shall not have strength to address you\r\nor other assemblages at length, even if I had the time to do so. I appear\r\nbefore you, therefore, for little else than to greet you, and to briefly\r\nsay farewell. You have done me the very high honor to present your\r\nreception courtesies to me through your great man a man with whom it is an\r\nhonor to be associated anywhere, and in owning whom no State can be poor.\r\nHe has said enough, and by the saying of it suggested enough, to require a\r\nresponse of an hour, well considered. I could not in an hour make a worthy\r\nresponse to it. I therefore, ladies and gentlemen of New Jersey, content\r\nmyself with saying, most heartily do I indorse all the sentiments he has\r\nexpressed. Allow me, most gratefully, to bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MAYOR OF NEWARK, NEW JERSEY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1861.\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR:--I thank you for this reception at the city of Newark. With\r\nregard to the great work of which you speak, I will say that I bring to it\r\na heart filled with love for my country, and an honest desire to do what\r\nis right. I am sure, however, that I have not the ability to do anything\r\nunaided of God, and that without His support and that of this free, happy,\r\nprosperous, and intelligent people, no man can succeed in doing that\r\nthe importance of which we all comprehend. Again thanking you for the\r\nreception you have given me, I will now bid you farewell, and proceed upon\r\nmy journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS IN TRENTON AT THE TRENTON HOUSE,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1861\r\n\r\nI have been invited by your representatives to the Legislature to visit\r\nthis the capital of your honored State, and in acknowledging their kind\r\ninvitation, compelled to respond to the welcome of the presiding officers\r\nof each body, and I suppose they intended I should speak to you through\r\nthem, as they are the representatives of all of you; and if I were to\r\nspeak again here, I should only have to repeat in a great measure much\r\nthat I have said, which would be disgusting to my friends around me who\r\nhave met here. I have no speech to make, but merely appear to see you and\r\nlet you look at me; and as to the latter I think I have greatly the best\r\nof the bargain. My friends, allow me to bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE SENATE OF NEW JERSEY\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY:--I\r\nam very grateful to you for the honorable reception of which I have been\r\nthe object. I cannot but remember the place that New Jersey holds in our\r\nearly history. In the Revolutionary struggle few of the States among the\r\nOld Thirteen had more of the battle-fields of the country within their\r\nlimits than New Jersey. May I be pardoned if, upon this occasion, I\r\nmention that away back in my childhood, the earliest days of my being\r\nable to read, I got hold of a small book, such a one as few of the younger\r\nmembers have ever seen Weems's Life of Washington. I remember all the\r\naccounts there given of the battle-fields and struggles for the liberties\r\nof the country; and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as\r\nthe struggle here at Trenton, New Jersey. The crossing of the river, the\r\ncontest with the Hessians, the great hardships endured at that time, all\r\nfixed themselves on my memory more than any single Revolutionary event;\r\nand you all know, for you have all been boys, how these early impressions\r\nlast longer than any others. I recollect thinking then, boy even though I\r\nwas, that there must have been something more than common that these men\r\nstruggled for. I am exceedingly anxious that that thing that something\r\neven more than national independence, that something that held out a\r\ngreat promise to all the people of the world to all time to come--I am\r\nexceedingly anxious that this Union, the Constitution, and the liberties\r\nof the people shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original idea\r\nfor which that struggle was made; and I shall be most happy indeed if I\r\nshall be a humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty, and of this his\r\nalmost chosen people, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle.\r\nYou give me this reception, as I understand, without distinction of party.\r\nI learn that this body is composed of a majority of gentlemen who, in the\r\nexercise of their best judgment in the choice of a chief magistrate,\r\ndid not think I was the man. I understand, nevertheless, that they come\r\nforward here to greet me as the constitutionally elected President of the\r\nUnited States--as citizens of the United States to meet the man who, for\r\nthe time being, is the representative of the majesty of the nation--united\r\nby the single purpose to perpetuate the Constitution, the union, and the\r\nliberties of the people. As such, I accept this reception more gratefully\r\nthan I could do did I believe it were tendered to me as an individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE ASSEMBLY OF NEW JERSEY,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER AND GENTLEMEN: I have just enjoyed the honor of a reception\r\nby the other branch of this Legislature, and I return to you and them my\r\nthanks for the reception which the people of New Jersey have given through\r\ntheir chosen representatives to me as the representative, for the time\r\nbeing, of the majesty of the people of the United States. I appropriate to\r\nmyself very little of the demonstrations of respect with which I have been\r\ngreeted. I think little should be given to any man, but that it should\r\nbe a manifestation of adherence to the Union and the Constitution. I\r\nunderstand myself to be received here by the representatives of the people\r\nof New Jersey, a majority of whom differ in opinion from those with whom\r\nI have acted. This manifestation is therefore to be regarded by me\r\nas expressing their devotion to the Union, the Constitution, and the\r\nliberties of the people.\r\n\r\nYou, Mr. Speaker, have well said that this is a time when the bravest and\r\nwisest look with doubt and awe upon the aspect presented by our national\r\naffairs. Under these circumstances you will readily see why I should not\r\nspeak in detail of the course I shall deem it best to pursue. It is proper\r\nthat I should avail myself of all the information and all the time at\r\nmy command, in order that when the time arrives in which I must speak\r\nofficially, I shall be able to take the ground which I deem best and\r\nsafest, and from which I may have no occasion to swerve. I shall endeavor\r\nto take the ground I deem most just to the North, the East, the West, the\r\nSouth, and the whole country. I shall take it, I hope, in good temper,\r\ncertainly with no malice toward any section. I shall do all that may be in\r\nmy power to promote a peaceful settlement of all our difficulties. The man\r\ndoes not live who is more devoted to peace than I am, none who would do\r\nmore to preserve it, but it may be necessary to put the foot down firmly.\r\nAnd if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not? [Loud\r\ncheers, and cries of \"Yes, yes; we will.\"] Received as I am by the members\r\nof a Legislature the majority of whom do not agree with me in political\r\nsentiments, I trust that I may have their assistance in piloting the ship\r\nof state through this voyage, surrounded by perils as it is; for if it\r\nshould suffer wreck now, there will be no pilot ever needed for another\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have already spoken longer than I intended, and must beg\r\nleave to stop here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA:--I appear before you to\r\nmake no lengthy speech, but to thank you for this reception. The reception\r\nyou have given me to-night is not to me, the man, the individual, but to\r\nthe man who temporarily represents, or should represent, the majesty of\r\nthe nation. It is true, as your worthy mayor has said, that there is great\r\nanxiety amongst the citizens of the United States at this time. I deem it\r\na happy circumstance that this dissatisfied portion of our fellow-citizens\r\ndoes not point us to anything in which they are being injured or about\r\nto be injured; for which reason I have felt all the while justified in\r\nconcluding that the crisis, the panic, the anxiety of the country at\r\nthis time is artificial. If there be those who differ with me upon this\r\nsubject, they have not pointed out the substantial difficulty that exists.\r\nI do not mean to say that an artificial panic may not do considerable\r\nharm; that it has done such I do not deny. The hope that has been\r\nexpressed by your mayor, that I may be able to restore peace, harmony, and\r\nprosperity to the country, is most worthy of him; and most happy, indeed,\r\nwill I be if I shall be able to verify and fulfil that hope. I promise\r\nyou that I bring to the work a sincere heart. Whether I will bring a head\r\nequal to that heart will be for future times to determine. It were useless\r\nfor me to speak of details of plans now; I shall speak officially next\r\nMonday week, if ever. If I should not speak then, it were useless for me\r\nto do so now. If I do speak then, it is useless for me to do so now. When\r\nI do speak, I shall take such ground as I deem best calculated to restore\r\npeace, harmony, and prosperity to the country, and tend to the perpetuity\r\nof the nation and the liberty of these States and these people. Your\r\nworthy mayor has expressed the wish, in which I join with him, that it\r\nwere convenient for me to remain in your city long enough to consult your\r\nmerchants and manufacturers; or, as it were, to listen to those breathings\r\nrising within the consecrated walls wherein the Constitution of the United\r\nStates and, I will add, the Declaration of Independence, were originally\r\nframed and adopted. I assure you and your mayor that I had hoped on this\r\noccasion, and upon all occasions during my life, that I shall do nothing\r\ninconsistent with the teachings of these holy and most sacred walls. I\r\nhave never asked anything that does not breathe from those walls. All my\r\npolitical warfare has been in favor of the teachings that come forth from\r\nthese sacred walls. May my right hand forget its cunning and my tongue\r\ncleave to the roof of my mouth if ever I prove false to those teachings.\r\nFellow-citizens, I have addressed you longer than I expected to do, and\r\nnow allow me to bid you goodnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS IN THE HALL OF INDEPENDENCE, PHILADELPHIA,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. CUYLER:--I am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing\r\nhere, in this place, where were collected together the wisdom, the\r\ndevotion to principle, from which sprang the institutions under which\r\nwe live. You have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of\r\nrestoring peace to the present distracted condition of the country. I can\r\nsay in return, sir, that all the political sentiments I entertain have\r\nbeen drawn, so far as I have been able to draw them, from the sentiments\r\nwhich originated and were given to the world from this hall. I have never\r\nhad a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied\r\nin the Declaration of Independence. I have often pondered over the dangers\r\nwhich were incurred by the men who assembled here and framed and adopted\r\nthat Declaration of Independence. I have pondered over the toils that\r\nwere endured by the officers and soldiers of the army who achieved that\r\nindependence. I have often inquired of myself what great principle or idea\r\nit was that kept the confederacy so long together. It was not the mere\r\nmatter of separation of the colonies from the motherland, but that\r\nsentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone\r\nto the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world for all future\r\ntime. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be\r\nlifted from the shoulders of all men. This is the sentiment embodied in\r\nthe Declaration of Independence. Now, my friends, can the country be saved\r\nupon that basis? If it can, I will consider myself one of the happiest\r\nmen in the world if I can help to save it. If it cannot be saved upon that\r\nprinciple, it will be truly awful. But if this country cannot be saved\r\nwithout giving up that principle, I was about to say I would rather\r\nbe assassinated on this spot than surrender it. Now, in my view of the\r\npresent aspect of affairs, there need be no bloodshed or war. There is no\r\nnecessity for it. I am not in favor of such a course, and I may say, in\r\nadvance, that there will be no bloodshed unless it is forced upon the\r\nGovernment, and then it will be compelled to act in self-defence.\r\n\r\nMy friends; this is wholly an unexpected speech, and I did not expect to\r\nbe called upon to say a word when I came here. I supposed it was merely\r\nto do something toward raising the flag. I may, therefore, have said\r\nsomething indiscreet. I have said nothing but what I am willing to live by\r\nand, if it be the pleasure of Almighty God, die by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE WILMINGTON DELEGATION,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN:--I feel highly flattered by the encomiums you have seen fit\r\nto bestow upon me. Soon after the nomination of General Taylor, I attended\r\na political meeting in the city of Wilmington, and have since carried with\r\nme a fond remembrance of the hospitalities of the city on that occasion.\r\nThe programme established provides for my presence in Harrisburg in\r\ntwenty-four hours from this time. I expect to be in Washington on\r\nSaturday. It is, therefore, an impossibility that I should accept your\r\nkind invitation. There are no people whom I would more gladly accommodate\r\nthan those of Delaware; but circumstances forbid, gentlemen. With many\r\nregrets for the character of the reply I am compelled to give you, I bid\r\nyou adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1860\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF OLD LANCASTER:--I appear not to make a speech. I\r\nhave not time to make a speech at length, and not strength to make them on\r\nevery occasion; and, worse than all, I have none to make. There is plenty\r\nof matter to speak about in these times, but it is well known that the\r\nmore a man speaks the less he is understood--the more he says one thing,\r\nthe more his adversaries contend he meant something else. I shall soon\r\nhave occasion to speak officially, and then I will endeavor to put my\r\nthoughts just as plain as I can express myself--true to the Constitution\r\nand Union of all the States, and to the perpetual liberty of all the\r\npeople. Until I so speak, there is no need to enter upon details. In\r\nconclusion, I greet you most heartily, and bid you an affectionate\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE LEGISLATURE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AT HARRISBURG,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1861\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER OF THE SENATE, AND ALSO MR. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF\r\nREPRESENTATIVES, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF\r\nPENNSYLVANIA:--I appear before you only for a very few brief remarks in\r\nresponse to what has been said to me. I thank you most sincerely for this\r\nreception, and the generous words in which support has been promised me\r\nupon this occasion. I thank your great commonwealth for the overwhelming\r\nsupport it recently gave, not me personally, but the cause which I think a\r\njust one, in the late election.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to the fact--the interesting fact perhaps we\r\nshould say--that I for the first time appear at the capital of the great\r\ncommonwealth of Pennsylvania upon the birthday of the Father of his\r\nCountry. In connection with that beloved anniversary connected with the\r\nhistory of this country, I have already gone through one exceedingly\r\ninteresting scene this morning in the ceremonies at Philadelphia. Under\r\nthe kind conduct of gentlemen there, I was for the first time allowed\r\nthe privilege of standing in old Independence Hall to have a few words\r\naddressed to me there, and opening up to me an opportunity of manifesting\r\nmy deep regret that I had not more time to express something of my own\r\nfeelings excited by the occasion, that had been really the feelings of my\r\nwhole life.\r\n\r\nBesides this, our friends there had provided a magnificent flag of the\r\ncountry. They had arranged it so that I was given the honor of raising it\r\nto the head of its staff, and when it went up I was pleased that it went\r\nto its place by the strength of my own feeble arm. When, according to the\r\narrangement, the cord was pulled, and it floated gloriously to the wind,\r\nwithout an accident, in the bright, glowing sunshine of the morning,\r\nI could not help hoping that there was in the entire success of that\r\nbeautiful ceremony at least something of an omen of what is to come. Nor\r\ncould I help feeling then, as I have often felt, that in the whole of that\r\nproceeding I was a very humbled instrument. I had not provided the flag; I\r\nhad not made the arrangements for elevating it to its place; I had applied\r\nbut a very small portion of even my feeble strength in raising it. In the\r\nwhole transaction I was in the hands of the people who had arranged it,\r\nand if I can have the same generous co-operation of the people of\r\nthis nation, I think the flag of our country may yet be kept flaunting\r\ngloriously.\r\n\r\nI recur for a moment but to repeat some words uttered at the hotel in\r\nregard to what has been said about the military support which the General\r\nGovernment may expect from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a proper\r\nemergency. To guard against any possible mistake do I recur to this. It is\r\nnot with any pleasure that I contemplate the possibility that a necessity\r\nmay arise in this country for the use of the military arm. While I am\r\nexceedingly gratified to see the manifestation upon your streets of your\r\nmilitary force here, and exceedingly gratified at your promise to use that\r\nforce upon a proper emergency--while I make these acknowledgments I desire\r\nto repeat, in order to preclude any possible misconstruction, that I do\r\nmost sincerely hope that we shall have no use for them; that it will\r\nnever become their duty to shed blood, and most especially never to shed\r\nfraternal blood. I promise that so far as I may have wisdom to direct,\r\nif so painful a result shall in any wise be brought about, it shall be\r\nthrough no fault of mine.\r\n\r\nAllusion has also been made by one of your honored speakers to some\r\nremarks recently made by myself at Pittsburg in regard to what is supposed\r\nto be the especial interest of this great commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I\r\nnow wish only to say in regard to that matter, that the few remarks which\r\nI uttered on that occasion were rather carefully worded. I took pains\r\nthat they should be so. I have seen no occasion since to add to them or\r\nsubtract from them. I leave them precisely as they stand, adding only\r\nnow that I am pleased to have an expression from you, gentlemen of\r\nPennsylvania, signifying that they are satisfactory to you.\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentlemen of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania, allow me again to return to you my most sincere thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MAYOR OF WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 27, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. MAYOR:--I thank you, and through you the municipal authorities of this\r\ncity who accompany you, for this welcome. And as it is the first time in\r\nmy life, since the present phase of politics has presented itself in this\r\ncountry, that I have said anything publicly within a region of country\r\nwhere the institution of slavery exists, I will take this occasion to\r\nsay that I think very much of the ill feeling that has existed and still\r\nexists between the people in the section from which I came and the people\r\nhere, is dependent upon a misunderstanding of one another. I therefore\r\navail myself of this opportunity to assure you, Mr. Mayor, and all the\r\ngentlemen present, that I have not now, and never have had, any other than\r\nas kindly feelings toward you as to the people of my own section. I have\r\nnot now, and never have had, any disposition to treat you in any respect\r\notherwise than as my own neighbors. I have not now any purpose to withhold\r\nfrom you any of the benefits of the Constitution, under any circumstances,\r\nthat I would not feel myself constrained to withhold from my own\r\nneighbors; and I hope, in a word, that when we shall become better\r\nacquainted--and I say it with great confidence--we shall like each other\r\nbetter. I thank you for the kindness of this reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A SERENADE AT WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 28, 1861\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS:--I suppose that I may take this as a compliment paid to me,\r\nand as such please accept my thanks for it. I have reached this city of\r\nWashington under circumstances considerably differing from those under\r\nwhich any other man has ever reached it. I am here for the purpose of\r\ntaking an official position amongst the people, almost all of whom were\r\npolitically opposed to me, and are yet opposed to me, as I suppose.\r\n\r\nI propose no lengthy address to you. I only propose to say, as I did on\r\nyesterday, when your worthy mayor and board of aldermen called upon me,\r\nthat I thought much of the ill feeling that has existed between you and\r\nthe people of your surroundings and that people from among whom I came,\r\nhas depended, and now depends, upon a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nI hope that, if things shall go along as prosperously as I believe we all\r\ndesire they may, I may have it in my power to remove something of this\r\nmisunderstanding; that I may be enabled to convince you, and the people\r\nof your section of the country, that we regard you as in all things\r\nour equals, and in all things entitled to the same respect and the same\r\ntreatment that we claim for ourselves; that we are in no wise disposed, if\r\nit were in our power, to oppress you, to deprive you of any of your rights\r\nunder the Constitution of the United States, or even narrowly to split\r\nhairs with you in regard to these rights, but are determined to give you,\r\nas far as lies in our hands, all your rights under the Constitution--not\r\ngrudgingly, but fully and fairly. I hope that, by thus dealing with you,\r\nwe will become better acquainted, and be better friends.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my friends, with these few remarks, and again returning my thanks\r\nfor this compliment, and expressing my desire to hear a little more of\r\nyour good music, I bid you good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, SUNDAY, MARCH 3, 1861\r\n\r\n[During the struggle over the appointments of LINCOLN's Cabinet, the\r\nPresident-elect spoke as follows:]\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is evident that some one must take the responsibility\r\nof these appointments, and I will do it. My Cabinet is completed. The\r\npositions are not definitely assigned, and will not be until I announce\r\nthem privately to the gentlemen whom I have selected as my Constitutional\r\nadvisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS, MARCH 4, 1861\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES:--In compliance with a custom as old\r\nas the Government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly, and\r\nto take in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of\r\nthe United States to be taken by the President \"before he enters on the\r\nexecution of his office.\"\r\n\r\nI do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters\r\nof administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement.\r\n\r\nApprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that\r\nby the accession of a Republican administration their property and their\r\npeace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any\r\nreasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to\r\nthe contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection.\r\nIt is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses\r\nyou. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that\r\n\r\n\"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the\r\ninstitution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no\r\nlawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThose who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had\r\nmade this and many similar declarations, and had never recanted them. And,\r\nmore than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a\r\nlaw to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and\r\nespecially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic\r\ninstitutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential\r\nto that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our\r\npolitical fabric depend, and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\r\nforce of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext,\r\nas amongst the gravest of crimes.\"\r\n\r\nI now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\r\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is\r\nsusceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are to\r\nbe in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration. I add, too,\r\nthat all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution and\r\nthe laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States when\r\nlawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one section as to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from\r\nservice or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the\r\nConstitution as any other of its provisions:\r\n\r\n\"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof,\r\nescaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation\r\ntherein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered\r\nup on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those\r\nwho made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the\r\nintention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear their\r\nsupport to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as to any\r\nother. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the\r\nterms of this clause \"shall be delivered up,\" their oaths are unanimous.\r\nNow, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not with\r\nnearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good\r\nthat unanimous oath?\r\n\r\nThere is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced\r\nby national or by State authority; but surely that difference is not a\r\nvery material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but\r\nlittle consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done. And\r\nshould any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a\r\nmerely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?\r\n\r\nAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\r\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so\r\nthat a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave? And might it\r\nnot be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that\r\nclause in the Constitution which guarantees that \"the citizens of each\r\nState shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in\r\nthe several States\"?\r\n\r\nI take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with no\r\npurpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules.\r\nAnd, while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as\r\nproper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all,\r\nboth in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all\r\nthose acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting\r\nto find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIt is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\r\nunder our national Constitution. During that period fifteen different\r\nand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government. They have conducted it through many\r\nperils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope of\r\nprecedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional\r\nterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of\r\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\r\n\r\nI hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\r\nthe Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not\r\nexpressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe\r\nto assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic\r\nlaw for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express\r\nprovisions of our national Constitution, and the Union will endure\r\nforever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not\r\nprovided for in the instrument itself.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association\r\nof States in the nature of contract merely, can it as a contract be\r\npeaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it? One party to\r\na contract may violate it--break it, so to speak; but does it not require\r\nall to lawfully rescind it?\r\n\r\nDescending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in\r\nlegal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of\r\nthe Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was\r\nformed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured\r\nand continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further\r\nmatured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted\r\nand engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation\r\nin 1778. And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining\r\nand establishing the Constitution was \"to form a more perfect Union.\"\r\n\r\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the\r\nStates be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the\r\nConstitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can\r\nlawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect\r\nare legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or States,\r\nagainst the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or\r\nrevolutionary, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the\r\nUnion is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as\r\nthe Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the\r\nUnion be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to\r\nbe only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it so far as\r\npracticable, unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall\r\nwithhold the requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the\r\ncontrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\r\ndeclared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and\r\nmaintain itself.\r\n\r\nIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\r\nshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power\r\nconfided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and\r\nplaces belonging to the Government, and to collect the duties and imposts;\r\nbut beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no\r\ninvasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere. Where\r\nhostility to the United States, in any interior locality, shall be so\r\ngreat and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding\r\nthe Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers\r\namong the people for that object. While the strict legal right may exist\r\nin the government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to\r\ndo so would be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that I\r\ndeem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices.\r\n\r\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of\r\nthe Union. So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\r\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and\r\nreflection. The course here indicated will be followed unless current\r\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\r\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\r\naccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope\r\nof a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of\r\nfraternal sympathies and affections.\r\n\r\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the\r\nUnion at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither\r\naffirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them. To\r\nthose, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national\r\nfabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not\r\nbe wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate\r\na step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly\r\nfrom have no real existence? Will you, while the certain ills you fly\r\nto are greater than all the real ones you fly from--will you risk the\r\ncommission of so fearful a mistake?\r\n\r\nAll profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can\r\nbe maintained. Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the\r\nConstitution, has been denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is so\r\nconstituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. Think,\r\nif you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of\r\nthe Constitution has ever been denied. If by the mere force of numbers a\r\nmajority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional\r\nright, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly\r\nwould if such a right were a vital one. But such is not our case. All the\r\nvital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to\r\nthem by affirmations and negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the\r\nConstitution, that controversies never arise concerning them. But no\r\norganic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to\r\nevery question which may occur in practical administration. No foresight\r\ncan anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain, express\r\nprovisions for all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be\r\nsurrendered by national or by State authority? The Constitution does\r\nnot expressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories? The\r\nConstitution does not expressly say. Must Congress protect slavery in the\r\nTerritories? The Constitution does not expressly say.\r\n\r\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,\r\nand we divide upon them into majorities and minorities. If the minority\r\nwill not acquiesce, the majority must, or the Government must cease. There\r\nis no other alternative; for continuing the Government is acquiescence on\r\none side or the other.\r\n\r\nIf a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a\r\nprecedent which in turn will divide and ruin them; for a minority of their\r\nown will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by\r\nsuch minority. For instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy\r\na year or two hence arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of\r\nthe present Union now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion\r\nsentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this.\r\n\r\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose a\r\nnew Union as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession?\r\n\r\nPlainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A\r\nmajority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and\r\nalways changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and\r\nsentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects\r\nit does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is\r\nimpossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly\r\ninadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or\r\ndespotism in some form is all that is left.\r\n\r\nI do not forget the position assumed by some, that constitutional\r\nquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny that such\r\ndecisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to\r\nthe object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect\r\nand consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the\r\ngovernment. And, while it is obviously possible that such decision may\r\nbe erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being\r\nlimited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled\r\nand never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than\r\ncould the evils of a different practice. At the same time, the candid\r\ncitizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital\r\nquestions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary\r\nlitigation between parties in personal actions, the people will have\r\nceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned\r\nthe government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor is there in\r\nthis view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a duty from\r\nwhich they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them,\r\nand it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to\r\npolitical purposes.\r\n\r\nOne section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be\r\nextended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be\r\nextended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause\r\nof the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave\r\ntrade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a\r\ncommunity where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law\r\nitself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\r\nin both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be\r\nperfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation\r\nof the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly\r\nsuppressed, would be ultimately revived, without restriction, in one\r\nsection, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not\r\nbe surrendered at all by the other.\r\n\r\nPhysically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective\r\nsections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A\r\nhusband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond\r\nthe reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot\r\ndo this. They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either\r\namicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible, then,\r\nto make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after\r\nseparation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can\r\nmake laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than\r\nlaws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always;\r\nand when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease\r\nfighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again\r\nupon you.\r\n\r\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit\r\nit. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can\r\nexercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary\r\nright to dismember or overthrow it. I cannot be ignorant of the fact that\r\nmany worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national\r\nConstitution amended. While I make no recommendation of amendments,\r\nI fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole\r\nsubject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the\r\ninstrument itself, and I should, under existing circumstances, favor\r\nrather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act\r\nupon it. I will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems\r\npreferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with the people\r\nthemselves, instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions\r\noriginated by others not especially chosen for the purpose, and which\r\nmight not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse.\r\nI understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution which amendment,\r\nhowever, I have not seen--has passed Congress, to the effect that the\r\nFederal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions\r\nof the States, including that of persons held to service. To avoid\r\nmisconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak\r\nof particular amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision\r\nto now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being\r\nmade express and irrevocable.\r\n\r\nThe chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and\r\nthey have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the\r\nStates. The people themselves can do this also if they choose; but the\r\nexecutive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer\r\nthe present government, as it came to his hands, and to transmit it,\r\nunimpaired by him, to his successors.\r\n\r\nWhy should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of\r\nthe people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? In our present\r\ndifferences is either party without faith of being in the right? If the\r\nAlmighty Ruler of nations, with his eternal truth and justice, be on your\r\nside of the North, or on yours of the South, that truth and that justice\r\nwill surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBy the frame of the government under which we live, this same people have\r\nwisely given their public servants but little power for mischief; and\r\nhave, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to their\r\nown hands at very short intervals. While the people retain their virtue\r\nand vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly,\r\ncan very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole subject.\r\nNothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an object\r\nto hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take\r\ndeliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good\r\nobject can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied still\r\nhave the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the\r\nlaws of your own framing under it; while the new administration will have\r\nno immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted\r\nthat you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there\r\nstill is no single good reason for precipitate action. Intelligence,\r\npatriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet\r\nforsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust in the best way\r\nall our present difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the\r\nmomentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you. You can\r\nhave no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath\r\nregistered in heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the\r\nmost solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" it.\r\n\r\nI am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be\r\nenemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break, our bonds of\r\naffection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field\r\nand patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this\r\nbroad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as\r\nsurely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFUSAL OF SEWARD RESIGNATION\r\n\r\nTO WM. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, March 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your note of the 2d instant, asking to withdraw your\r\nacceptance of my invitation to take charge of the State Department, was\r\nduly received. It is the subject of the most painful solicitude with me,\r\nand I feel constrained to beg that you will countermand the withdrawal.\r\nThe public interest, I think, demands that you should; and my personal\r\nfeelings are deeply enlisted in the same direction. Please consider and\r\nanswer by 9 A.M. to-morrow.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE PENNSYLVANIA DELEGATION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MARCH 5, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE PENNSYLVANIAN DELEGATION:--As I have so\r\nfrequently said heretofore, when I have had occasion to address the people\r\nof the Keystone, in my visits to that State, I can now but repeat the\r\nassurance of my gratification at the support you gave me at the election,\r\nand at the promise of a continuation of that support which is now tendered\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to the hope that you entertain that you have a\r\nPresident and a government. In respect to that I wish to say to you that\r\nin the position I have assumed I wish to do more than I have ever given\r\nreason to believe I would do. I do not wish you to believe that I assume\r\nto be any better than others who have gone before me. I prefer rather to\r\nhave it understood that if we ever have a government on the principles we\r\nprofess, we should remember, while we exercise our opinion, that others\r\nhave also rights to the exercise of their opinions, and that we should\r\nendeavor to allow these rights, and act in such a manner as to create no\r\nbad feeling. I hope we have a government and a President. I hope, and\r\nwish it to be understood, that there may be no allusion to unpleasant\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that the people of all the States are entitled to all the\r\nprivileges and immunities of the citizens of the several States. We should\r\nbear this in mind, and act in such a way as to say nothing insulting\r\nor irritating. I would inculcate this idea, so that we may not, like\r\nPharisees, set ourselves up to be better than other people.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, my public duties are pressing to-day, and will prevent\r\nmy giving more time to you. Indeed, I should not have left them now, but I\r\ncould not well deny myself to so large and respectable a body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MASSACHUSETTS DELEGATION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MARCH 5, 1861\r\n\r\nI am thankful for this renewed assurance of kind feeling and confidence,\r\nand the support of the old Bay State, in so far as you, Mr. Chairman, have\r\nexpressed, in behalf of those whom you represent, your sanction of what\r\nI have enunciated in my inaugural address. This is very grateful to my\r\nfeelings. The object was one of great delicacy, in presenting views at the\r\nopening of an administration under the peculiar circumstances attending my\r\nentrance upon the official duties connected with the Government. I studied\r\nall the points with great anxiety, and presented them with whatever\r\nof ability and sense of justice I could bring to bear. If it met the\r\napprobation of our good friends in Massachusetts, I shall be exceedingly\r\ngratified, while I hope it will meet the approbation of friends\r\neverywhere. I am thankful for the expressions of those who have voted\r\nwith us; and like every other man of you, I like them as certainly as I do\r\nothers. As the President in the administration of the Government, I\r\nhope to be man enough not to know one citizen of the United States from\r\nanother, nor one section from another. I shall be gratified to have good\r\nfriends of Massachusetts and others who have thus far supported me in\r\nthese national views still to support me in carrying them out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE CHAMBER, MARCH 7, 1861\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Herewith is the diplomatic address and my reply. To whom the\r\nreply should be addressed--that is, by what title or style--I do not quite\r\nunderstand, and therefore I have left it blank.\r\n\r\nWill you please bring with you to-day the message from the War Department,\r\nwith General Scott's note upon it, which we had here yesterday? I wish to\r\nexamine the General's opinion, which I have not yet done.\r\n\r\nYours very truly\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 7, 1861\r\n\r\nMr. FIGANIERE AND GENTLEMEN OF THE DIPLOMATIC BODY:--Please accept my\r\nsincere thanks for your kind congratulations. It affords me pleasure\r\nto confirm the confidence you so generously express in the friendly\r\ndisposition of the United States, through me, towards the sovereigns and\r\ngovernments you respectively represent. With equal satisfaction I accept\r\nthe assurance you are pleased to give, that the same disposition is\r\nreciprocated by your sovereigns, your governments, and yourselves.\r\n\r\nAllow me to express the hope that these friendly relations may remain\r\nundisturbed, and also my fervent wishes for the health and happiness of\r\nyourselves personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 11,1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF STATE. DEAR SIR:--What think you of sending ministers\r\nat once as follows: Dayton to England; Fremont to France; Clay to Spain;\r\nCorwin to Mexico?\r\n\r\nWe need to have these points guarded as strongly and quickly as possible.\r\nThis is suggestion merely, and not dictation.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. COLLAMER\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 12, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. JACOB COLLAMER. MY DEAR SIR:--God help me. It is said I have offended\r\nyou. I hope you will tell me how.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 14, 1861. DEAR SIR:--I am entirely unconscious that you have any way\r\noffended me. I cherish no sentiment towards you but that of kindness and\r\nconfidence. Your humble servant, J. COLLAMER.\r\n\r\n [Returned with indorsement:]\r\n\r\nVery glad to know that I have n't.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 13, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. P. M. G.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--The bearer of this, Mr. C. T. Hempstow, is a Virginian who\r\nwishes to get, for his son, a small place in your Dept. I think Virginia\r\nshould be heard, in such cases.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ASKING CABINET OPINIONS ON FORT SUMTER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 15, 1861\r\n\r\nTHE HONORABLE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Assuming it to be possible to now provision Fort Sumter,\r\nunder all the circumstances is it wise to attempt it? Please give me your\r\nopinion in writing on this question.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Same to other members of the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON ROYAL ARBITRATION OF AMERICAN BOUNDARY LINE\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nThe Senate has transmitted to me a copy of the message sent by my\r\npredecessor to that body on the 21st of February last, proposing to take\r\nits advice on the subject of a proposition made by the British Government\r\nthrough its minister here to refer the matter in controversy between that\r\ngovernment and the Government of the United States to the arbitrament\r\nof the King of Sweden and Norway, the King of the Netherlands, or the\r\nRepublic of the Swiss Confederation.\r\n\r\nIn that message my predecessor stated that he wished to present to the\r\nSenate the precise questions following, namely:\r\n\r\n\"Will the Senate approve a treaty referring to either of the sovereign\r\npowers above named the dispute now existing between the governments of\r\nthe United States and Great Britain concerning the boundary line between\r\nVancouver's Island and the American continent? In case the referee shall\r\nfind himself unable to decide where the line is by the description of it\r\nin the treaty of June 15, 1846, shall he be authorized to establish a line\r\naccording to the treaty as nearly as possible? Which of the three powers\r\nnamed by Great Britain as an arbiter shall be chosen by the United\r\nStates?\"\r\n\r\nI find no reason to disapprove of the course of my predecessor in this\r\nimportant matter; but, on the contrary, I not only shall receive the\r\nadvice of the Senate thereon cheerfully, but I respectfully ask the Senate\r\nfor their advice on the three questions before recited.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 16, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBASSADORIAL APPOINTMENTS\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 18, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I believe it is a necessity with us to make the appointments\r\nI mentioned last night--that is, Charles F. Adams to England, William L.\r\nDayton to France, George P. Marsh to Sardinia, and Anson Burlingame to\r\nAustria. These gentlemen all have my highest esteem, but no one of them is\r\noriginally suggested by me except Mr. Dayton. Mr. Adams I take because you\r\nsuggested him, coupled with his eminent fitness for the place. Mr.\r\nMarsh and Mr. Burlingame I take because of the intense pressure of their\r\nrespective States, and their fitness also.\r\n\r\nThe objection to this card is that locally they are so huddled up--three\r\nbeing in New England and two from a single State. I have considered this,\r\nand will not shrink from the responsibility. This, being done, leaves but\r\nfive full missions undisposed of--Rome, China, Brazil, Peru, and Chili.\r\nAnd then what about Carl Schurz; or, in other words, what about our German\r\nfriends?\r\n\r\nShall we put the card through, and arrange the rest afterward? What say\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. E. PATTEN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, March 19, 1861.\r\n\r\nTO MASTER GEO. EVANS PATTEN.\r\n\r\nWHOM IT MAY CONCERN:--I did see and talk with Master Geo. Evans Patten\r\nlast May at Springfield, Ill.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Written because of a denial that any interview with young Patten, then a\r\nschoolboy, had ever taken place.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO SENATE INQUIRY RE. FORT SUMTER\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:--I have received a copy of the\r\nresolution of the Senate, passed on the 25th instant, requesting me, if\r\nin my opinion not incompatible with the public interest, to communicate to\r\nthe Senate the despatches of Major Robert Anderson to the War Department\r\nduring the time he has been in command of Fort Sumter. On examination of\r\nthe correspondence thus called for, I have, with the highest respect\r\nfor the Senate, come to the conclusion that at the present moment the\r\npublication of it would be inexpedient.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MARCH 16, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF FIRST NAVAL ACTION\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MARCH 29, 1861\r\n\r\nHONORABLE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I desire that an expedition to move by sea be got ready to sail\r\nas early as the 6th of April next, the whole according to memorandum\r\nattached, and that you cooperate with the Secretary of the Navy for that\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Inclosure.]\r\n\r\nSteamers Pocahontas at Norfolk, Paunee at Washington, Harriet Lane at\r\nNew York, to be under sailing orders for sea, with stores, etc., for one\r\nmonth. Three hundred men to be kept ready for departure from on board\r\nthe receiving-ships at New York. Two hundred men to be ready to leave\r\nGovernor's Island in New York. Supplies for twelve months for one hundred\r\nmen to be put in portable shape, ready for instant shipping. A large\r\nsteamer and three tugs conditionally engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ------ STUART.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 30, 1861\r\n\r\nDEAR STUART:\r\n\r\nCousin Lizzie shows me your letter of the 27th. The question of giving her\r\nthe Springfield post-office troubles me. You see I have already appointed\r\nWilliam Jayne a Territorial governor and Judge Trumbull's brother to a\r\nland-office. Will it do for me to go on and justify the declaration that\r\nTrumbull and I have divided out all the offices among our relatives? Dr.\r\nWallace, you know, is needy, and looks to me; and I personally owe him\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nI see by the papers, a vote is to be taken as to the post-office. Could\r\nyou not set up Lizzie and beat them all? She, being here, need know\r\nnothing of it, so therefore there would be no indelicacy on her part.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDANT OF THE NEW YORK NAVY-YARD.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPT., WASHINGTON, April 1, 1861\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDANT OF THE NAVY-YARD, Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\nFit out the Powhatan to go to sea at the earnest possible moment under\r\nsealed orders. Orders by a confidential messenger go forward to-morrow.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LIEUTENANT D. D. PORTER\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, April 1, 1861\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT D. D. PORTER, United States Navy.\r\n\r\nSIR:--You will proceed to New York, and with the least possible delay,\r\nassuming command of any naval steamer available, proceed to Pensacola\r\nHarbor, and at any cost or risk prevent any expedition from the mainland\r\nreaching Fort Pickens or Santa Rosa Island.\r\n\r\nYou will exhibit this order to any naval officer at Pensacola, if you deem\r\nit necessary, after you have established yourself within the harbor, and\r\nwill request co-operation by the entrance of at least one other steamer.\r\n\r\nThis order, its object, and your destination will be communicated to no\r\nperson whatever until you reach the harbor of Pensacola.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

But in taking this step the\r\nGovernment does not in the least reflect upon your efficiency or\r\npatriotism; on the contrary, have the fullest confidence in your ability\r\nto perform any duty required of you. Hoping soon to be able to give you a\r\nbetter command than the one you now enjoy, and trusting that you will have\r\nfull confidence in the disposition of the Government toward you, I remain,\r\netc.,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY SEWARD'S BID FOR POWER\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM FROM SECRETARY SEWARD, APRIL 1, 1861\r\n\r\nSome thoughts for the President's Consideration,\r\n\r\nFirst. We are at the end of a month's administration, and yet without a\r\npolicy either domestic or foreign.\r\n\r\nSecond. This, however, is not culpable, and it has even been unavoidable.\r\nThe presence of the Senate, with the need to meet applications for\r\npatronage, have prevented attention to other and more grave matters.\r\n\r\nThird. But further delay to adopt and prosecute our policies for\r\nboth domestic and foreign affairs would not only bring scandal on the\r\nadministration, but danger upon the country.\r\n\r\nFourth. To do this we must dismiss the applicants for office. But how? I\r\nsuggest that we make the local appointments forthwith, leaving foreign or\r\ngeneral ones for ulterior and occasional action.\r\n\r\nFifth. The policy at home. I am aware that my views are singular, and\r\nperhaps not sufficiently explained. My system is built upon this idea as\r\na ruling one, namely, that we must CHANGE THE QUESTION BEFORE THE PUBLIC\r\nFROM ONE UPON SLAVERY, OR ABOUT SLAVERY, for a question upon UNION OR\r\nDISUNION: In other words, from what would be regarded as a party question,\r\nto one of patriotism or union.\r\n\r\nThe occupation or evacuation of Fort Sumter, although not in fact a\r\nslavery or a party question, is so regarded. Witness the temper manifested\r\nby the Republicans in the free States, and even by the Union men in the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nI would therefore terminate it as a safe means for changing the issue. I\r\ndeem it fortunate that the last administration created the necessity.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, I would simultaneously defend and reinforce all the ports in\r\nthe gulf, and have the navy recalled from foreign stations to be prepared\r\nfor a blockade. Put the island of Key West under martial law.\r\n\r\nThis will raise distinctly the question of union or disunion. I would\r\nmaintain every fort and possession in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR FOREIGN NATIONS,\r\n\r\nI would demand explanations from Spain and France, categorically, at once.\r\n\r\nI would seek explanations from Great Britain and Russia, and send agents\r\ninto Canada, Mexico, and Central America to rouse a vigorous continental\r\nspirit of independence on this continent against European intervention.\r\n\r\nAnd, if satisfactory explanations are not received from Spain and France,\r\n\r\nWould convene Congress and declare war against them.\r\n\r\nBut whatever policy we adopt, there must be an energetic prosecution of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue and direct it\r\nincessantly.\r\n\r\nEither the President must do it himself, and be all the while active in\r\nit, or Devolve it on some member of his Cabinet. Once adopted, debates on\r\nit must end, and all agree and abide.\r\n\r\nIt is not in my especial province; But I neither seek to evade nor assume\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO SECRETARY SEWARD'S MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, APRIL 1, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Since parting with you I have been considering your\r\npaper dated this day, and entitled \"Some Thoughts for the President's\r\nConsideration.\" The first proposition in it is, \"First, We are at the end\r\nof a month's administration, and yet without a policy either domestic or\r\nforeign.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of that month, in the inaugural, I said: \"The power\r\nconfided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property\r\nand places belonging to the Government, and to Collect the duties and\r\nimposts.\" This had your distinct approval at the time; and, taken in\r\nconnection with the order I immediately gave General Scott, directing\r\nhim to employ every means in his power to strengthen and hold the\r\nforts, comprises the exact domestic policy you now urge, with the single\r\nexception that it does not propose to abandon Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nAgain, I do not perceive how the reinforcement of Fort Sumter would be\r\ndone on a slavery or a party issue, while that of Fort Pickens would be on\r\na more national and patriotic one.\r\n\r\nThe news received yesterday in regard to St. Domingo certainly brings a\r\nnew item within the range of our foreign policy; but up to that time we\r\nhave been preparing circulars and instructions to ministers and the like,\r\nall in perfect harmony, without even a suggestion that we had no foreign\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nUpon your Closing propositions--that,\r\n\r\n\"Whatever policy we adopt, there must be an energetic prosecution of it.\r\n\r\n\"For this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue and direct it\r\nincessantly.\r\n\r\n\"Either the President must do it himself, and be all the while active in\r\nit, or,\r\n\r\n\"Devolve it on some member of his Cabinet. Once adopted, debates on it\r\nmust end, and all agree and abide\"--\r\n\r\nI remark that if this must be done, I must do it. When a general line of\r\npolicy is adopted, I apprehend there is no danger of its being changed\r\nwithout good reason, or continuing to be a subject of unnecessary debate;\r\nstill, upon points arising in its progress I wish, and suppose I am\r\nentitled to have, the advice of all the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A COMMITTEE FROM THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION, APRIL 13, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM BALLARD PRESTON, ALEXANDER H. H. STUART, GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,\r\nEsq.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--As a committee of the Virginia Convention now in Session, you\r\npresent me a preamble and resolution in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, in the opinion of this Convention, the uncertainty which\r\nprevails in the public mind as to the policy which the Federal Executive\r\nintends to pursue toward the seceded States is extremely injurious to the\r\nindustrial and commercial interests of the country, tends to keep up an\r\nexcitement which is unfavorable to the adjustment of pending difficulties,\r\nand threatens a disturbance of the public peace: therefore\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, that a committee of three delegates be appointed by this\r\nConvention to wait upon the President of the United States, present to him\r\nthis preamble and resolution, and respectfully ask him to communicate to\r\nthis Convention the policy which the Federal Executive intends to pursue\r\nin regard to the Confederate States.\r\n\r\n\"Adopted by the Convention of the State of Virginia, Richmond, April 8,\r\n1861.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer I have to say that, having at the beginning of my official term\r\nexpressed my intended policy as plainly as I was able, it is with\r\ndeep regret and some mortification I now learn that there is great and\r\ninjurious uncertainty in the public mind as to what that policy is, and\r\nwhat course I intend to pursue. Not having as yet seen occasion to change,\r\nit is now my purpose to pursue the course marked out in the inaugural\r\naddress. I commend a careful consideration of the whole document as the\r\nbest expression I can give of my purposes.\r\n\r\nAs I then and therein said, I now repeat: \"The power confided to me will\r\nbe used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to\r\nthe Government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what is\r\nnecessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force\r\nagainst or among the people anywhere.\" By the words \"property and places\r\nbelonging to the Government,\" I chiefly allude to the military posts and\r\nproperty which were in the possession of the Government when it came to my\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nBut if, as now appears to be true, in pursuit of a purpose to drive the\r\nUnited States authority from these places, an unprovoked assault has been\r\nmade upon Fort Sumter, I shall hold myself at liberty to repossess, if I\r\ncan, like places which had been seized before the Government was devolved\r\nupon me. And in every event I shall, to the extent of my ability,\r\nrepel force by force. In case it proves true that Fort Sumter has been\r\nassaulted, as is reported, I shall perhaps cause the United States mails\r\nto be withdrawn from all the States which claim to have seceded, believing\r\nthat the commencement of actual war against the Government justifies and\r\npossibly demands this.\r\n\r\nI scarcely need to say that I consider the military posts and property\r\nsituated within the States which claim to have seceded as yet belonging\r\nto the Government of the United States as much as they did before the\r\nsupposed secession.\r\n\r\nWhatever else I may do for the purpose, I shall not attempt to collect the\r\nduties and imposts by any armed invasion of any part of the country; not\r\nmeaning by this, however, that I may not land a force deemed necessary to\r\nrelieve a fort upon a border of the country.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that I have quoted a part of the inaugural address, it must\r\nnot be inferred that I repudiate any other part, the whole of which I\r\nreaffirm, except so far as what I now say of the mails may be regarded as\r\na modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CALLING FOR 75,000 MILITIA,\r\n\r\nAND CONVENING CONGRESS IN EXTRA SESSION, APRIL 15, 1861.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas the laws of the United States have been for some time past and now\r\nare opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, in the States of South\r\nCarolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas,\r\nby combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of\r\njudicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals bylaw:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, A. LINCOLN, President of the United States, in virtue\r\nof the power in me vested by the Constitution and the laws, have thought\r\nfit to call forth, and hereby do call forth, the militia of the several\r\nStates of the Union, to the aggregate number of seventy-five thousand,\r\nin order to suppress said combinations, and to cause the laws to be duly\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nThe details for this object will be immediately communicated to the State\r\nauthorities through the War Department.\r\n\r\nI appeal to all loyal citizens to favor, facilitate, and aid this effort\r\nto maintain the honor, the integrity, and the existence of our National\r\nUnion, and the perpetuity of popular government; and to redress wrongs\r\nalready long enough endured.\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to say that the first service assigned to the forces\r\nhereby called forth will probably be to repossess the forts, places, and\r\nproperty which have been seized from the Union; and in every event the\r\nutmost care will be observed, consistently with the objects aforesaid, to\r\navoid any devastation, any destruction of or interference with property,\r\nor any disturbance of peaceful citizens in any part of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby command the persons composing the combinations aforesaid to\r\ndisperse and retire peacefully to their respective abodes within twenty\r\ndays from date.\r\n\r\nDeeming that the present condition of public affairs presents an\r\nextraordinary occasion, I do hereby, in virtue of the power in me vested\r\nby the Constitution, convene both Houses of Congress. Senators and\r\nRepresentatives are therefore summoned to assemble at their respective\r\nchambers, at twelve o'clock noon, on Thursday, the fourth day of July\r\nnext, then and there to consider and determine such measures as, in their\r\nwisdom, the public safety and interest may seem to demand.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this fifteenth day of April, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF BLOCKADE, APRIL 19, 1861\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas an insurrection against the Government of the United States has\r\nbroken out in the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and the laws of the United States\r\nfor the collection of the revenue cannot be effectually executed therein\r\nconformably to that provision of the Constitution which requires duties to\r\nbe uniform throughout the United States:\r\n\r\nAnd Whereas a combination of persons engaged in such insurrection have\r\nthreatened to grant pretended letters of marque to authorize the bearers\r\nthereof to commit assaults on the lives, vessels, and property of good\r\ncitizens of the country lawfully engaged in commerce on the high seas, and\r\nin waters of the United States:\r\n\r\nAnd Whereas an executive proclamation has been already issued requiring\r\nthe persons engaged in these disorderly proceedings to desist therefrom,\r\ncalling out a militia force for the purpose of repressing the same, and\r\nconvening Congress in extraordinary session to deliberate and determine\r\nthereon:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham LINCOLN, President of the United States, with\r\na view to the same purposes before mentioned, and to the protection of\r\nthe public peace, and the lives and property of quiet and orderly citizens\r\npursuing their lawful occupations, until Congress shall have assembled and\r\ndeliberated on the said unlawful proceedings, or until the same shall have\r\nceased, have further deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade of the\r\nports within the States aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws of the United\r\nStates, and of the law of nations in such case provided. For this purpose\r\na competent force will be posted so as to prevent entrance and exit of\r\nvessels from the ports aforesaid. If, therefore, with a view to violate\r\nsuch blockade, a vessel shall approach or shall attempt to leave either\r\nof the said ports, she will be duly warned by the commander of one of the\r\nblockading vessels, who will indorse on her register the fact and date of\r\nsuch warning, and if the same vessel shall again attempt to enter or\r\nleave the blockaded port, she will be captured and sent to the nearest\r\nconvenient port, for such proceedings against her and her cargo, as prize,\r\nas may be deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby proclaim and declare that if any person, under the pretended\r\nauthority of the said States, or under any other pretense, shall molest a\r\nvessel of the United States, or the persons or cargo on board of her,\r\nsuch person will be held amenable to the laws of the United States for the\r\nprevention and punishment of piracy.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of April, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR HICKS AND MAYOR BROWN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 20, 1861\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR HICKS AND MAYOR BROWN.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter by Messrs. Bond, Dobbin, and Brune is received.\r\nI tender you both my sincere thanks for your efforts to keep the peace in\r\nthe trying situation in which you are placed.\r\n\r\nFor the future troops must be brought here, but I make no point of\r\nbringing them through Baltimore. Without any military knowledge myself, of\r\ncourse I must leave details to General Scott. He hastily said this morning\r\nin the presence of these gentlemen, \"March them around Baltimore, and\r\nnot through it.\" I sincerely hope the General, on fuller reflection, will\r\nconsider this practical and proper, and that you will not object to it.\r\nBy this a collision of the people of Baltimore with the troops will be\r\navoided, unless they go out of their way to seek it. I hope you will exert\r\nyour influence to prevent this.\r\n\r\nNow and ever I shall do all in my power for peace consistently with the\r\nmaintenance of the Government.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR HICKS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 20, 1861\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR HICKS:\r\n\r\nI desire to consult with you and the Mayor of Baltimore relative to\r\npreserving the peace of Maryland. Please come immediately by special\r\ntrain, which you can take at Baltimore; or, if necessary, one can be sent\r\nfrom here. Answer forthwith.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER TO DEFEND FROM A MARYLAND INSURRECTION\r\n\r\nORDER TO GENERAL SCOTT. WASHINGTON, April 25, 1861\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL SCOTT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--The Maryland Legislature assembles to-morrow at Annapolis,\r\nand not improbably will take action to arm the people of that State\r\nagainst the United States. The question has been submitted to and\r\nconsidered by me whether it would not be justifiable, upon the ground of\r\nnecessary defense, for you, as General in Chief of the United States Army,\r\nto arrest or disperse the members of that body. I think it would not be\r\njustifiable nor efficient for the desired object.\r\n\r\nFirst. They have a clearly legal right to assemble, and we cannot know in\r\nadvance that their action will not be lawful and peaceful, and if we wait\r\nuntil they shall have acted their arrest or dispersion will not lessen the\r\neffect of their action.\r\n\r\nSecondly. We cannot permanently prevent their action. If we arrest them,\r\nwe cannot long hold them as prisoners, and when liberated they will\r\nimmediately reassemble and take their action; and precisely the same if\r\nwe simply disperse them--they will immediately reassemble in some other\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nI therefore conclude that it is only left to the Commanding General to\r\nwatch and await their action, which, if it shall be to arm their people\r\nagainst the United States, he is to adopt the most prompt and efficient\r\nmeans to counteract, even, if necessary, to the bombardment of their\r\ncities and, in the extremist necessity, the suspension of the writ of\r\nhabeas corpus.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF BLOCKADE, APRIL 27, 1861\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, for the reasons assigned in my proclamation of the nineteenth\r\ninstant, a blockade of the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia,\r\nFlorida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas was ordered to be\r\nestablished:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, since that date, public property of the United States\r\nhas been seized, the collection of the revenue obstructed, and duly\r\ncommissioned officers of the United States, while engaged in executing\r\nthe orders of their superiors, have been arrested and held in custody as\r\nprisoners, or have been impeded in the discharge of their official duties,\r\nwithout due legal process, by persons claiming to act under authorities of\r\nthe States of Virginia and North Carolina:\r\n\r\nAn efficient blockade of the ports of those States will also be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this twenty seventh day of April, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS TO A MILITARY COMPANY, WASHINGTON, APRIL 27, 1861\r\n\r\nI have desired as sincerely as any man, and I sometimes think more than\r\nany other man, that our present difficulties might be settled without the\r\nshedding of blood. I will not say that all hope has yet gone; but if the\r\nalternative is presented whether the Union is to be broken in fragments\r\nand the liberties of the people lost, or blood be shed, you will probably\r\nmake the choice with which I shall not be dissatisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCALIZED REPEAL OF WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SCOTT.\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDING GENERAL, ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nYou are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against the laws of the\r\nUnited States. If at any point on or in the vicinity of any military line\r\nwhich is now or which shall be used between the City of Philadelphia and\r\nthe city of Washington you find resistance which renders it necessary to\r\nsuspend the writ of habeas corpus for the public safety, you personally,\r\nor through the officer in command at the point at which resistance occurs,\r\nare authorized to suspend that writ.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 17, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY ENROLLMENT OF ST. LOUIS CITIZENS\r\n\r\nFROM THE SECRETARY OF WAR WAR DEPARTMENT, April 30, 1861\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN NATHANIEL LYON.\r\n\r\nCAPT. NATHANIEL LYON, Commanding Department of the West.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The President of the United States directs that you enroll in the\r\nmilitary service of the United States the loyal citizens of Saint Louis\r\nand vicinity, not exceeding, with those heretofore enlisted, ten thousand\r\nin number, for the purpose of maintaining the authority of the United\r\nStates; for the protection of the peaceful inhabitants of Missouri; and\r\nyou will, if deemed necessary for that purpose by yourself, by Messrs.\r\nOliver F. Ferny, John How, James O. Broadhead, Samuel T. Glover, J.\r\nWilzie, Francis P. Blair, Jr., proclaim martial law in the city of Saint\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\nThe additional force hereby authorized shall be discharged in part or in\r\nwhole, if enlisted. As soon as it appears to you and the gentlemen above\r\nmentioned that there is no danger of an attempt on the part of the enemies\r\nof the Government to take military possession of the city of Saint Louis,\r\nor put the city in control of the combination against the Government of\r\nthe United States; and whilst such additional force remains in the service\r\nthe same shall be governed by the Rules and Articles of War, and such\r\nspecial regulations as you may prescribe. I shall like the force hereafter\r\ndirected to be enrolled to be under your command.\r\n\r\nThe arms and other military stores in the Saint Louis Arsenal not needed\r\nfor the forces of the United States in Missouri must be removed to\r\nSpringfield, or some other safe place of deposit in the State of Illinois,\r\nas speedily as practicable, by the ordnance officers in charge at Saint\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\n(Indorsement.)\r\n\r\nIt is revolutionary times, and therefore I do not object to the\r\nirregularity of this. W. S.\r\n\r\nApproved, April 30, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nColonel Thomas will make this order.  SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDOLENCE OVER FAILURE OF FT. SUMTER RELIEF\r\n\r\nTO GUSTAVUS V. FOX.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., May 1, 1861\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN G. V. Fox.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I sincerely regret that the failure of the late attempt to\r\nprovision Fort Sumter should be the source of any annoyance to you.\r\n\r\nThe practicability of your plan was not, in fact, brought to a test. By\r\nreason of a gale, well known in advance to be possible and not improbable,\r\nthe tugs, an essential part of the plan, never reached the ground; while,\r\nby an accident for which you were in no wise responsible, and possibly I\r\nto some extent was, you were deprived of a war vessel, with her men, which\r\nyou deemed of great importance to the enterprise.\r\n\r\nI most cheerfully and truly declare that the failure of the undertaking\r\nhas not lowered you a particle, while the qualities you developed in the\r\neffort have greatly heightened you in my estimation.\r\n\r\nFor a daring and dangerous enterprise of a similar character you would\r\nto-day be the man of all my acquaintances whom I would select. You and I\r\nboth anticipated that the cause of the country would be advanced by making\r\nthe attempt to provision Fort Sumter, even if it should fail; and it is\r\nno small consolation now to feel that our anticipation is justified by the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nVery truly your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CALLING FOR 42,034 VOLUNTEERS,\r\n\r\nMAY 3, 1861\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA Proclamation..\r\n\r\nWhereas existing exigencies demand immediate and adequate measures for\r\nthe protection of the National Constitution and the preservation of the\r\nNational Union by the suppression of the insurrectionary combinations\r\nnow existing in several States for opposing the laws of the Union and\r\nobstructing the execution thereof, to which end a military force in\r\naddition to that called forth by my proclamation of the 15th day of April\r\nin the present year appears to be indispensably necessary:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States and\r\nCommander in Chief of the Army and Navy thereof and of the militia of the\r\nseveral States when called into actual service, do hereby call into the\r\nservice of the United States 42,034 volunteers to serve for the period of\r\nthree years, unless sooner discharged, and to be mustered into service\r\nas infantry and cavalry. The proportions of each arm and the details of\r\nenrollment and organization will be made known through the Department of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nAnd I also direct that the Regular Army of the United States be increased\r\nby the addition of eight regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry,\r\nand one regiment of artillery, making altogether a maximum aggregate\r\nincrease of 22,714 officers and enlisted men, the details of which\r\nincrease will also be made known through the Department of War.\r\n\r\nAnd I further direct the enlistment for not less than one or more than\r\nthree years of 18,000 seamen, in addition to the present force, for the\r\nnaval service of the United States. The details of the enlistment and\r\norganization will be made known through the Department of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe call for volunteers hereby made and the direction for the increase of\r\nthe Regular Army and for the enlistment of seamen hereby given, together\r\nwith the plan of organization adopted for the volunteer and for the\r\nregular forces hereby authorized, will be submitted to Congress as soon as\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I earnestly invoke the co-operation of all good citizens\r\nin the measures hereby adopted for the effectual suppression of unlawful\r\nviolence, for the impartial enforcement of constitutional laws, and for\r\nthe speediest possible restoration of peace and order, and with these of\r\nhappiness and prosperity, throughout our country.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my band and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed................\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN'S CORRECTIONS OF A DIPLOMATIC DESPATCH\r\n\r\nWRITTEN BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO MINISTER ADAMS\r\n\r\nNO. 10.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE. WASHINGTON, May 21, 1861\r\n\r\nSIR:---Mr. Dallas, in a brief despatch of May 2d (No. 333), tells us that\r\nLord John Russell recently requested an interview with him on account of\r\nthe solicitude which his lordship felt concerning the effect of certain\r\nmeasures represented as likely to be adopted by the President. In\r\nthat conversation the British secretary told Mr. Dallas that the three\r\nrepresentatives of the Southern Confederacy were then in London, that Lord\r\nJohn Russell had not yet seen them, but that he was not unwilling to see\r\nthem unofficially. He further informed Mr. Dallas that an understanding\r\nexists between the British and French governments which would lead both to\r\ntake one and the same course as to recognition. His lordship then referred\r\nto the rumor of a meditated blockade by us of Southern ports, and a\r\ndiscontinuance of them as ports of entry. Mr. Dallas answered that he knew\r\nnothing on those topics, and therefore\r\n\r\n   (The President's corrections, both in notes and text, are in\r\n   caps. All matter between brackets was to be marked out.)\r\n\r\ncould say nothing. He added that you were expected to arrive in two weeks.\r\nUpon this statement Lord John Russell acquiesced in the expediency of\r\nwaiting for the full knowledge you were expected to bring.\r\n\r\nMr. Dallas transmitted to us some newspaper reports of ministerial\r\nexplanations made in Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou will base no proceedings on parliamentary debates further than to seek\r\nexplanations when necessary and communicate them to this department.\r\n[We intend to have a clear and simple record of whatever issue may arise\r\nbetween us and Great Britain.]\r\n\r\nThe President [is surprised and grieved] regrets that Mr. Dallas did not\r\nprotest against the proposed unofficial intercourse between the British\r\nGovernment and the missionaries of the insurgents [as well as against\r\nthe demand for explanations made by the British Government]. It is due,\r\nhowever, to Mr. Dallas to say that our instructions had been given only to\r\nyou and not to him, and that his loyalty and fidelity, too rare in these\r\ntimes [among our late representatives abroad, are confessed and] are\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nIntercourse of any kind with the so-called commissioners is liable to be\r\nconstrued as a recognition of the authority which appointed them. Such\r\nintercourse would be none the less [wrongful] hurtful to us for being\r\ncalled unofficial, and it might be even more injurious, because we should\r\nhave no means of knowing what points might be resolved by it. Moreover,\r\nunofficial intercourse is useless and meaningless if it is not expected\r\nto ripen into official intercourse and direct recognition. It is left\r\ndoubtful here whether the proposed unofficial intercourse has yet actually\r\nbegun. Your own [present] antecedent instructions are deemed explicit\r\nenough, and it is hoped that you have not misunderstood them. You will\r\nin any event desist from all intercourse whatever, unofficial as well\r\nas official, with the British Government, so long as it shall continue\r\nintercourse of either kind with the domestic enemies of this country\r\n[confining yourself to a delivery of a copy of this paper to the Secretary\r\nof State. After doing this.] When intercourse shall have been arrested for\r\nthis cause, you will communicate with this department and receive further\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell has informed us of an understanding between the British\r\nand French governments that they will act together in regard to our\r\naffairs. This communication, however, loses something of its value from\r\nthe circumstance that the communication was withheld until after knowledge\r\nof the fact had been acquired by us from other sources. We know also\r\nanother fact that has not yet been officially communicated to us--namely,\r\nthat other European States are apprised by France and England of their\r\nagreement, and are expected to concur with or follow them in whatever\r\nmeasures they adopt on the subject of recognition. The United States have\r\nbeen impartial and just in all their conduct toward the several nations of\r\nEurope. They will not complain, however, of the combination now announced\r\nby the two leading powers, although they think they had a right to expect\r\na more independent, if not a more friendly, course from each of them. You\r\nwill take no notice of that or any other alliance. Whenever the European\r\ngovernments shall see fit to communicate directly with us, we shall be, as\r\nheretofore, frank and explicit in our reply.\r\n\r\nAs to the blockade, you will say that by [the] our own laws [of nature]\r\nand the laws of nature and the laws of nations, this Government has\r\na clear right to suppress insurrection. An exclusion of commerce from\r\nnational ports which have been seized by the insurgents, in the equitable\r\nform of blockade, is the proper means to that end. You will [admit] not\r\ninsist that our blockade is [not] to be respected if it be not maintained\r\nby a competent force; but passing by that question as not now a practical,\r\nor at least an urgent, one, you will add that [it] the blockade is now,\r\nand it will continue to be so maintained, and therefore we expect it to be\r\nrespected by Great Britain. You will add that we have already revoked the\r\nexequatur of a Russian consul who had enlisted in the military service of\r\nthe insurgents, and we shall dismiss or demand the recall of every foreign\r\nagent, consular or diplomatic, who shall either disobey the Federal laws\r\nor disown the Federal authority.\r\n\r\nAs to the recognition of the so-called Southern Confederacy, it is not\r\nto be made a subject of technical definition. It is, of course, [quasi]\r\ndirect recognition to publish an acknowledgment of the sovereignty and\r\nindependence of a new power. It is [quasi] direct recognition to receive\r\nits ambassadors, ministers, agents, or commissioners officially.\r\nA concession of belligerent rights is liable to be construed as a\r\nrecognition of them. No one of these proceedings will [be borne] pass\r\n[unnoticed] unquestioned by the United States in this case.\r\n\r\nHitherto recognition has been moved only on the assumption that the\r\nso-called Confederate States are de facto a self-sustaining power. Now,\r\nafter long forbearance, designed to soothe discontent and avert the need\r\nof civil war, the land and naval forces of the United States have been put\r\nin motion to repress the insurrection. The true character of the pretended\r\nnew State is at once revealed. It is seen to be a power existing in\r\npronunciamento only, It has never won a field. It has obtained no forts\r\nthat were not virtually betrayed into its hands or seized in breach of\r\ntrust. It commands not a single port on the coast nor any highway out from\r\nits pretended capital by land. Under these circumstances Great Britain is\r\ncalled upon to intervene and give it body and independence by resisting\r\nour measures of suppression. British recognition would be British\r\nintervention to create within our own territory a hostile state by\r\noverthrowing this republic itself. [When this act of intervention is\r\ndistinctly performed, we from that hour shall cease to be friends, and\r\nbecome once more, as we have twice before been forced to be, enemies of\r\nGreat Britain.]\r\n\r\nAs to the treatment of privateers in the insurgent service, you will say\r\nthat this is a question exclusively our own. We treat them as pirates.\r\nThey are our own citizens, or persons employed by our citizens, preying\r\non the commerce of our country. If Great Britain shall choose to recognize\r\nthem as lawful belligerents, and give them shelter from our pursuit and\r\npunishment, the laws of nations afford an adequate and proper remedy\r\n[and we shall avail ourselves of it. And while you need not say this in\r\nadvance, be sure that you say nothing inconsistent with it.]\r\n\r\nHappily, however, her Britannic Majesty's government can avoid all these\r\ndifficulties. It invited us in 1856 to accede to the declaration of the\r\nCongress of Paris, of which body Great Britain was herself a member,\r\nabolishing privateering everywhere in all cases and forever. You already\r\nhave our authority to propose to her our accession to that declaration. If\r\nshe refuse to receive it, it can only be because she is willing to become\r\nthe patron of privateering when aimed at our devastation.\r\n\r\nThese positions are not elaborately defended now, because to vindicate\r\nthem would imply a possibility of our waiving them.\r\n\r\n1 We are not insensible of the grave importance of\r\n\r\n1 (Drop all from this line to the end, and in lieu of it write, \"This\r\npaper is for your own guidance only, and not [sic] to be read or shown to\r\nany one.\")\r\n\r\n(Secretary Seward, when the despatch was returned to him, added\r\nan introductory paragraph stating that the document was strictly\r\nconfidential. For this reason these last two paragraphs remained as they\r\nare here printed.)\r\n\r\nthis occasion. We see how, upon the result of the debate in which we are\r\nengaged, a war may ensue between the United States and one, two, or even\r\nmore European nations. War in any case is as exceptionable from the habits\r\nas it is revolting from the sentiments of the American people. But if\r\nit come, it will be fully seen that it results from the action of Great\r\nBritain, not our own; that Great Britain will have decided to fraternize\r\nwith our domestic enemy, either without waiting to hear from you our\r\nremonstrances and our warnings, or after having heard them. War in defense\r\nof national life is not immoral, and war in defense of independence is an\r\ninevitable part of the discipline of nations.\r\n\r\nThe dispute will be between the European and the American branches of the\r\nBritish race. All who belong to that race will especially deprecate it,\r\nas they ought. It may well be believed that men of every race and kindred\r\nwill deplore it. A war not unlike it between the same parties occurred at\r\nthe close of the last century. Europe atoned by forty years of suffering\r\nfor the error that Great Britain committed in provoking that contest. If\r\nthat nation shall now repeat the same great error, the social convulsions\r\nwhich will follow may not be so long, but they will be more general. When\r\nthey shall have ceased, it will, we think, be seen, whatever may have been\r\nthe fortunes of other nations, that it is not the United States that\r\nwill have come out of them with its precious Constitution altered or its\r\nhonestly obtained dominion in any degree abridged. Great Britain has but\r\nto wait a few months and all her present inconveniences will cease with\r\nall our own troubles. If she take a different course, she will calculate\r\nfor herself the ultimate as well as the immediate consequences, and will\r\nconsider what position she will hold when she shall have forever lost the\r\nsympathies and the affections of the only nation on whose sympathies and\r\naffections she has a natural claim. In making that calculation she will do\r\nwell to remember that in the controversy she proposes to open we shall be\r\nactuated by neither pride, nor passion, nor cupidity, nor ambition; but\r\nwe shall stand simply on the principle of self-preservation, and that our\r\ncause will involve the independence of nations and the rights of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, respectfully your obedient servant, W. H. S.\r\n\r\nCHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS, Esq., etc,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, May 21, 1861.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR. MY DEAR SIR:--Why cannot Colonel Small's\r\nPhiladelphia regiment be received? I sincerely wish it could. There is\r\nsomething strange about it. Give these gentlemen an interview, and take\r\ntheir regiment.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MORGAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 12, 1861\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR E. D. MORGAN, Albany, N.Y.\r\n\r\nI wish to see you face to face to clear these difficulties about\r\nforwarding troops from New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN DAHLGREEN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE, MANSION, May 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nCAPT. DAHLGREEN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Allow me to introduce Col. J. A. McLernand, M.C. of my own\r\ndistrict in Illinois. If he should desire to visit Fortress Monroe, please\r\nintroduce him to the captain of one of the vessels in our service, and\r\npass him down and back.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF CONDOLENCE TO ONE OF FIRST CASUALTIES\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL ELLSWORTH'S PARENTS, WASHINGTON, D.C., May 25, 1861\r\n\r\nTO THE FATHER AND MOTHER OF COL. ELMER E. ELLSWORTH.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR AND MADAME:--In the untimely loss of your noble son, our\r\naffliction here is scarcely less than your own. So much of promised\r\nusefulness to one's country, and of bright hopes for one's self and\r\nfriends, have never been so suddenly dashed as in his fall. In size, in\r\nyears, and in youthful appearance a boy only, his power to command men\r\nwas surpassingly great. This power, combined with a fine intellectual and\r\nindomitable energy, and a taste altogether military, constituted in him,\r\nas seemed to me, the best natural talent in that department I ever knew.\r\nAnd yet he was singularly modest and deferential in social intercourse.\r\nMy acquaintance with him began less than two years ago; yet, through the\r\nlatter half of the intervening period, it was as intense as the disparity\r\nof our ages and my engrossing engagements would permit. To me he appeared\r\nto have no indulgences or pastimes, and I never heard him utter a profane\r\nor an intemperate word. What was conclusive of his good heart, he never\r\nforgot his parents. The honors he labored for so laudably, and for which,\r\nin the sad end, he so gallantly gave his life, he meant for them no less\r\nthan for himself.\r\n\r\nIn the hope that it may be no intrusion upon the sacredness of your\r\nsorrow, I have ventured to address you this tribute to the memory of my\r\nyoung friend and your brave and early fallen son.\r\n\r\nMay God give you the consolation which is beyond all early power.\r\n\r\nSincerely your friend in common affliction,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BARTLETT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 27, 1861\r\n\r\nCOL. W. A. BARTLETT, New York.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Brigade was to go to Fort Monroe without trouble to the\r\ngovernment, and must so go or not at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM ABOUT INDIANA REGIMENTS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JUNE 11, 1861\r\n\r\n The government has already accepted ten regiments from the State of\r\nIndiana. I think at least six more ought to be received from that State,\r\ntwo to be those of Colonel James W. McMillan and Colonel William L.\r\nBrown, and the other four to be designated by the Governor of the State\r\nof Indiana, and to be received into the volunteer service of the United\r\nStates according to the \"Plan of Organization\" in the General Orders of\r\nthe War Department, No.15. When they report to Major-General McClellan in\r\ncondition to pass muster according to that order, and with the approval of\r\nthe Secretary of War to be indorsed hereon, and left in his department,\r\nI direct that the whole six, or any smaller number of such regiments, be\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, JUNE 13, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--There is, it seems, a regiment in Massachusetts commanded\r\nby Fletcher Webster, and which HON. Daniel Webster's old friends very much\r\nwish to get into the service. If it can be received with the approval of\r\nyour department and the consent of the Governor of Massachusetts I shall\r\nindeed be much gratified. Give Mr. Ashmun a chance to explain fully.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, JUNE 13, 1861 HON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--I think it is entirely safe to accept a fifth regiment from\r\nMichigan, and with your approbation I should say a regiment presented by\r\nCol. T. B. W. Stockton, ready for service within two weeks from now, will\r\nbe received. Look at Colonel Stockton's testimonials.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, June 17, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY Of WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--With your concurrence, and that of the Governor of Indiana,\r\nI am in favor of accepting into what we call the three years' service any\r\nnumber not exceeding four additional regiments from that State. Probably\r\nthey should come from the triangular region between the Ohio and Wabash\r\nRivers, including my own old boyhood home. Please see HON. C. M. Allen,\r\nSpeaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, and unless you perceive\r\ngood reason to the contrary, draw up an order for him according to the\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, JUNE 17,1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR. MY DEAR SIR:--With your concurrence, and that of\r\nthe Governor of Ohio, I am in favor of receiving into what we call the\r\nthree years' service any number not exceeding six additional regiments\r\nfrom that State, unless you perceive good reasons to the contrary. Please\r\nsee HON. John A. Gurley, who bears this, and make an order corresponding\r\nwith the above.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO N. W. EDWARDS\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., June 19, 1861\r\n\r\nHon. N. W. EDWARDS MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n....When you wrote me some time ago in reference to looking up something\r\nin the departments here, I thought I would inquire into the thing and\r\nwrite you, but the extraordinary pressure upon me diverted me from it, and\r\nsoon it passed out of my mind. The thing you proposed, it seemed to me, I\r\nought to understand myself before it was set on foot by my direction or\r\npermission; and I really had no time to make myself acquainted with it.\r\nNor have I yet. And yet I am unwilling, of course, that you should be\r\ndeprived of a chance to make something, if it can be done without\r\ninjustice to the Government, or to any individual. If you choose to come\r\nhere and point out to me how this can be done I shall not only not object,\r\nbut shall be gratified to be able to oblige you.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CAMERON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, June 20, 1861.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Since you spoke to me yesterday about General J. H. Lane, of\r\nKansas, I have been reflecting upon the subject, and have concluded that\r\nwe need the service of such a man out there at once; that we had better\r\nappoint him a brigadier-general of volunteers to-day, and send him off\r\nwith such authority to raise a force (I think two regiments better than\r\nthree, but as to this I am not particular) as you think will get him into\r\nactual work quickest. Tell him, when he starts, to put it through not to\r\nbe writing or telegraphing back here, but put it through.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Lane has been authorized to raise two additional regiments of\r\nvolunteers.\r\n\r\nSIMON CAMERON, Secretary o f War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE KENTUCKY DELEGATION.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, June 29, 1861.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE KENTUCKY DELEGATION WHO ARE FOR THE UNION:\r\n\r\nI somewhat wish to authorize my friend Jesse Bayles to raise a Kentucky\r\nregiment, but I do not wish to do it without your consent. If you consent,\r\nplease write so at the bottom of this.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n   We consent:\r\n   R. MALLORY.\r\n   H. GRIDER.\r\n   G. W. DUNLAP.\r\n   J. S. JACKSON.\r\n   C. A. WICKLIFFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 5, 1861.\r\n\r\nI repeat, I would like for Col. Bayles to raise a regiment of cavalry\r\nwhenever the Union men of Kentucky desire or consent to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER AUTHORIZING GENERAL SCOTT TO SUSPEND THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS, JULY\r\n2, 1861\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDING GENERAL, ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nYou are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against the laws of the\r\nUnited States. If at any point on or in the vicinity of any military line\r\nwhich is now or which shall be used between the city of New York and\r\nthe city of Washington you find resistance which renders it necessary to\r\nsuspend the writ of habeas corpus for the public safety, you personally,\r\nor through the officer in command at the point where resistance occurs,\r\nare authorized to suspend that writ.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States at the city of\r\nWashington, this second day of July, A.D. 1861, and of the independence of\r\nthe United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, JULY 3, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--General Scott had sent me a copy of the despatch of which\r\nyou kindly sent one. Thanks to both him and you. Please assemble the\r\nCabinet at twelve to-day to look over the message and reports.\r\n\r\nAnd now, suppose you step over at once and let us see General Scott (and)\r\nGeneral Cameron about assigning a position to General Fremont.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS IN SPECIAL SESSION,\r\n\r\nJULY 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:--Having been\r\nconvened on an extraordinary occasion, as authorized by the Constitution,\r\nyour attention is not called to any ordinary subject of legislation.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present Presidential term, four months ago, the\r\nfunctions of the Federal Government were found to be generally\r\nsuspended within the several States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Florida, excepting only those of the\r\nPost-Office Department.\r\n\r\nWithin these States all the forts, arsenals, dockyards, custom-houses, and\r\nthe like, including the movable and stationary property in and about\r\nthem, had been seized, and were held in open hostility to this government,\r\nexcepting only Forts Pickens, Taylor, and Jefferson, on and near the\r\nFlorida coast, and Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. The\r\nforts thus seized had been put in improved condition, new ones had been\r\nbuilt, and armed forces had been organized and were organizing, all\r\navowedly with the same hostile purpose.\r\n\r\nThe forts remaining in the possession of the Federal Government in and\r\nnear these States were either besieged or menaced by warlike preparations,\r\nand especially Fort Sumter was nearly surrounded by well-protected\r\nhostile batteries, with guns equal in quality to the best of its own, and\r\noutnumbering the latter as perhaps ten to one. A disproportionate share\r\nof the Federal muskets and rifles had somehow found their way into\r\nthese States, and had been seized to be used against the government.\r\nAccumulations of the public revenue lying within them had been seized for\r\nthe same object. The navy was scattered in distant seas, leaving but\r\na very small part of it within the immediate reach of the government.\r\nOfficers of the Federal army and navy had resigned in great numbers;\r\nand of those resigning a large proportion had taken up arms against the\r\ngovernment. Simultaneously, and in connection with all this, the purpose\r\nto sever the Federal Union was openly avowed. In accordance with this\r\npurpose, an ordinance had been adopted in each of these States, declaring\r\nthe States respectively to be separated from the national Union. A\r\nformula for instituting a combined government of these States had\r\nbeen promulgated; and this illegal organization, in the character\r\nof confederate States, was already invoking recognition, aid, and\r\nintervention from foreign powers.\r\n\r\nFinding this condition of things, and believing it to be an imperative\r\nduty upon the incoming executive to prevent, if possible, the consummation\r\nof such attempt to destroy the Federal Union, a choice of means to that\r\nend became indispensable. This choice was made and was declared in the\r\ninaugural address. The policy chosen looked to the exhaustion of all\r\npeaceful measures before a resort to any stronger ones. It sought only\r\nto hold the public places and property not already wrested from the\r\ngovernment, and to collect the revenue, relying for the rest on time,\r\ndiscussion, and the ballot-box. It promised a continuance of the mails, at\r\ngovernment expense, to the very people who were resisting the government;\r\nand it gave repeated pledges against any disturbance to any of the\r\npeople, or any of their rights. Of all that which a President might\r\nconstitutionally and justifiably do in such a case, everything was\r\nforborne without which it was believed possible to keep the government on\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of March (the present incumbent's first full day in office), a\r\nletter of Major Anderson, commanding at Fort Sumter, written on the 28th\r\nof February and received at the War Department on the 4th of March, was\r\nby that department placed in his hands. This letter expressed the\r\nprofessional opinion of the writer that reinforcements could not be thrown\r\ninto that fort within the time for his relief, rendered necessary by the\r\nlimited supply of provisions, and with a view of holding possession of the\r\nsame, with a force of less than twenty thousand good and well-disciplined\r\nmen. This opinion was concurred in by all the officers of his command, and\r\ntheir memoranda on the subject were made inclosures of Major Anderson's\r\nletter. The whole was immediately laid before Lieutenant-General Scott,\r\nwho at once concurred with Major Anderson in opinion. On reflection,\r\nhowever, he took full time, consulting with other officers, both of\r\nthe army and the navy, and at the end of four days came reluctantly but\r\ndecidedly to the same conclusion as before. He also stated at the\r\nsame time that no such sufficient force was then at the control of the\r\ngovernment, or could be raised and brought to the ground within the time\r\nwhen the provisions in the fort would be exhausted. In a purely military\r\npoint of view, this reduced the duty of the administration in the case to\r\nthe mere matter of getting the garrison safely out of the fort.\r\n\r\nIt was believed, however, that to so abandon that position, under the\r\ncircumstances, would be utterly ruinous; that the necessity under which\r\nit was to be done would not be fully understood; that by many it would\r\nbe construed as a part of a voluntary policy; that at home it would\r\ndiscourage the friends of the Union, embolden its adversaries, and go far\r\nto insure to the latter a recognition abroad; that in fact, it would\r\nbe our national destruction consummated. This could not be allowed.\r\nStarvation was not yet upon the garrison, and ere it would be reached\r\nFort Pickens might be reinforced. This last would be a clear indication\r\nof policy, and would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of\r\nFort Sumter as a military necessity. An order was at once directed to be\r\nsent for the landing of the troops from the steamship Brooklyn into Fort\r\nPickens. This order could not go by land, but must take the longer and\r\nslower route by sea. The first return news from the order was received\r\njust one week before the fall of Fort Sumter. The news itself was that\r\nthe officer commanding the Sabine, to which vessel the troops had been\r\ntransferred from the Brooklyn, acting upon some quasi armistice of\r\nthe late administration (and of the existence of which the present\r\nadministration, up to the time the order was despatched, had only too\r\nvague and uncertain rumors to fix attention), had refused to land the\r\ntroops. To now reinforce Fort Pickens before a crisis would be reached\r\nat Fort Sumter was impossible--rendered so by the near exhaustion\r\nof provisions in the latter-named fort. In precaution against such a\r\nconjuncture, the government had, a few days before, commenced preparing\r\nan expedition as well adapted as might be to relieve Fort Sumter, which\r\nexpedition was intended to be ultimately used, or not, according to\r\ncircumstances. The strongest anticipated case for using it was now\r\npresented, and it was resolved to send it forward. As had been intended\r\nin this contingency, it was also resolved to notify the governor of South\r\nCarolina that he might expect an attempt would be made to provision the\r\nfort; and that, if the attempt should not be resisted, there would be no\r\neffort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition, without further notice, or\r\nin case of an attack upon the fort. This notice was accordingly given;\r\nwhereupon the fort was attacked and bombarded to its fall, without even\r\nawaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of Fort Sumter was in\r\nno sense a matter of self-defense on the part of the assailants. They\r\nwell knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit\r\naggression upon them. They knew--they were expressly notified--that the\r\ngiving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was all\r\nwhich would on that occasion be attempted, unless themselves, by resisting\r\nso much, should provoke more. They knew that this government desired to\r\nkeep the garrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to maintain\r\nvisible possession, and thus to preserve the Union from actual and\r\nimmediate dissolution--trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to time,\r\ndiscussion, and the ballot-box for final adjustment; and they assailed\r\nand reduced the fort for precisely the reverse object--to drive out the\r\nvisible authority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to immediate\r\ndissolution. That this was their object the executive well understood; and\r\nhaving said to them in the inaugural address, \"You can have no conflict\r\nwithout being yourselves the aggressors,\" he took pains not only to keep\r\nthis declaration good, but also to keep the case so free from the power of\r\ningenious sophistry that the world should not be able to misunderstand\r\nit. By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances, that\r\npoint was reached. Then and thereby the assailants of the government began\r\nthe conflict of arms, without a gun in sight or in expectancy to return\r\ntheir fire, save only the few in the fort sent to that harbor years before\r\nfor their own protection, and still ready to give that protection in\r\nwhatever was lawful. In this act, discarding all else, they have forced\r\nupon the country the distinct issue, \"immediate dissolution or blood.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States. It\r\npresents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional\r\nrepublic or democracy--a government of the people by the same people--can\r\nor cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic\r\nfoes. It presents the question whether discontented individuals, too few\r\nin numbers to control administration according to organic law in any\r\ncase, can always, upon the pretenses made in this case, or on any other\r\npretenses, or arbitrarily without any pretense, break up their government,\r\nand thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth. It\r\nforces us to ask: Is there in all republics this inherent and fatal\r\nweakness? Must a government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties\r\nof its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?\r\n\r\nSo viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the war power\r\nof the government, and so to resist force employed for its destruction by\r\nforce for its preservation.\r\n\r\nThe call was made, and the response of the country was most gratifying,\r\nsurpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation. Yet\r\nnone of the States commonly called slave States, except Delaware, gave\r\na regiment through regular State organization. A few regiments have been\r\norganized within some others of those States by individual enterprise,\r\nand received into the government service. Of course the seceded States,\r\nso called (and to which Texas had been joined about the time of the\r\ninauguration), gave no troops to the cause of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe border States, so called, were not uniform in their action, some\r\nof them being almost for the Union, while in others--as Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas--the Union sentiment was nearly\r\nrepressed and silenced. The course taken in Virginia was the most\r\nremarkable--perhaps the most important. A convention elected by the people\r\nof that State to consider this very question of disrupting the Federal\r\nUnion was in session at the capital of Virginia when Fort Sumter fell. To\r\nthis body the people had chosen a large majority of professed Union men.\r\nAlmost immediately after the fall of Sumter, many members of that majority\r\nwent over to the original disunion minority, and with them adopted an\r\nordinance for withdrawing the State from the Union. Whether this change\r\nwas wrought by their great approval of the assault upon Sumter, or their\r\ngreat resentment at the government's resistance to that assault, is not\r\ndefinitely known. Although they submitted the ordinance for ratification\r\nto a vote of the people, to be taken on a day then somewhat more than\r\na month distant, the convention and the Legislature (which was also in\r\nsession at the same time and place), with leading men of the State not\r\nmembers of either, immediately commenced acting as if the State were\r\nalready out of the Union. They pushed military preparations vigorously\r\nforward all over the State. They seized the United States armory at\r\nHarper's Ferry, and the navy-yard at Gosport, near Norfolk. They received\r\nperhaps invited--into their State large bodies of troops, with their\r\nwarlike appointments, from the so-called seceded States. They formally\r\nentered into a treaty of temporary alliance and co-operation with the\r\nso-called \"Confederate States,\" and sent members to their congress at\r\nMontgomery. And finally, they permitted the insurrectionary government to\r\nbe transferred to their capital at Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia have thus allowed this giant insurrection to make\r\nits nest within her borders; and this government has no choice left but\r\nto deal with it where it finds it. And it has the less regret as the loyal\r\ncitizens have, in due form, claimed its protection. Those loyal citizens\r\nthis government is bound to recognize and protect, as being Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the border States, so called,--in fact, the middle States,--there are\r\nthose who favor a policy which they call \"armed neutrality\"; that is, an\r\narming of those States to prevent the Union forces passing one way, or\r\nthe disunion the other, over their soil. This would be disunion completed.\r\nFiguratively speaking, it would be the building of an impassable wall\r\nalong the line of separation--and yet not quite an impassable one, for\r\nunder the guise of neutrality it would tie the hands of Union men and\r\nfreely pass supplies from among them to the insurrectionists, which it\r\ncould not do as an open enemy. At a stroke it would take all the trouble\r\noff the hands of secession, except only what proceeds from the external\r\nblockade. It would do for the disunionists that which, of all things, they\r\nmost desire--feed them well and give them disunion without a struggle of\r\ntheir own. It recognizes no fidelity to the Constitution, no obligation to\r\nmaintain the Union; and while very many who have favored it are doubtless\r\nloyal citizens, it is, nevertheless, very injurious in effect.\r\n\r\nRecurring to the action of the government, it may be stated that at\r\nfirst a call was made for 75,000 militia; and, rapidly following this,\r\na proclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary\r\ndistricts by proceedings in the nature of blockade. So far all was\r\nbelieved to be strictly legal. At this point the insurrectionists\r\nannounced their purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering.\r\n\r\nOther calls were made for volunteers to serve for three years, unless\r\nsooner discharged, and also for large additions to the regular army and\r\nnavy. These measures, whether strictly legal or not, were ventured\r\nupon, under what appeared to be a popular demand and a public necessity;\r\ntrusting then, as now, that Congress would readily ratify them. It is\r\nbelieved that nothing has been done beyond the constitutional competency\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nSoon after the first call for militia, it was considered a duty to\r\nauthorize the commanding general in proper cases, according to his\r\ndiscretion, to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or,\r\nin other words, to arrest and detain, without resort to the ordinary\r\nprocesses and forms of law, such individuals as he might deem dangerous\r\nto the public safety. This authority has purposely been exercised but very\r\nsparingly. Nevertheless, the legality and propriety of what has been done\r\nunder it are questioned, and the attention of the country has been called\r\nto the proposition that one who has sworn to \"take care that the laws\r\nbe faithfully executed\" should not himself violate them. Of course some\r\nconsideration was given to the questions of power and propriety before\r\nthis matter was acted upon. The whole of the laws which were required to\r\nbe faithfully executed were being resisted and failing of execution in\r\nnearly one third of the States. Must they be allowed to finally fail of\r\nexecution, even had it been perfectly clear that by the use of the\r\nmeans necessary to their execution some single law, made in such extreme\r\ntenderness of the citizen's liberty that, practically, it relieves more\r\nof the guilty than of the innocent, should to a very limited extent be\r\nviolated? To state the question more directly, are all the laws but one\r\nto go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be\r\nviolated? Even in such a case, would not the official oath be broken if\r\nthe government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding\r\nthe single law would tend to preserve it? But it was not believed\r\nthat this question was presented. It was not believed that any law was\r\nviolated. The provision of the Constitution that \"the privilege of the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of\r\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,\" is equivalent to\r\na provision--is a provision--that such privilege may be suspended when, in\r\ncase of rebellion or invasion, the public safety does require it. It was\r\ndecided that we have a case of rebellion, and that the public safety does\r\nrequire the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which was\r\nauthorized to be made. Now it is insisted that Congress, and not the\r\nexecutive, is vested with this power. But the Constitution itself is\r\nsilent as to which or who is to exercise the power; and as the provision\r\nwas plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be believed the\r\nframers of the instrument intended that in every case the danger\r\nshould run its course until Congress could be called together, the very\r\nassembling of which might be prevented, as was intended in this case, by\r\nthe rebellion.\r\n\r\nNo more extended argument is now offered, as an opinion at some length\r\nwill probably be presented by the attorney-general. Whether there shall be\r\nany legislation upon the subject, and if any, what, is submitted entirely\r\nto the better judgment of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe forbearance of this government had been so extraordinary and so long\r\ncontinued as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as if they\r\nsupposed the early destruction of our national Union was probable. While\r\nthis, on discovery, gave the executive some concern, he is now happy\r\nto say that the sovereignty and rights of the United States are now\r\neverywhere practically respected by foreign powers; and a general sympathy\r\nwith the country is manifested throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and the Navy will\r\ngive the information in detail deemed necessary and convenient for your\r\ndeliberation and action; while the executive and all the departments will\r\nstand ready to supply omissions, or to communicate new facts considered\r\nimportant for you to know.\r\n\r\nIt is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this\r\ncontest a short and decisive one: that you place at the control of\r\nthe government for the work at least four hundred thousand men and\r\n$400,000,000. That number of men is about one-tenth of those of proper\r\nages within the regions where, apparently, all are willing to engage; and\r\nthe sum is less than a twenty-third part of the money value owned by the\r\nmen who seem ready to devote the whole. A debt of $600,000,000 now is a\r\nless sum per head than was the debt of our Revolution when we came out of\r\nthat struggle; and the money value in the country now bears even a greater\r\nproportion to what it was then than does the population. Surely each man\r\nhas as strong a motive now to preserve our liberties as each had then to\r\nestablish them.\r\n\r\nA right result at this time will be worth more to the world than ten times\r\nthe men and ten times the money. The evidence reaching us from the country\r\nleaves no doubt that the material for the work is abundant, and that it\r\nneeds only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction, and the hand\r\nof the executive to give it practical shape and efficiency. One of the\r\ngreatest perplexities of the government is to avoid receiving troops\r\nfaster than it can provide for them. In a word, the people will save their\r\ngovernment if the government itself will do its part only indifferently\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nIt might seem, at first thought, to be of little difference whether the\r\npresent movement at the South be called \"secession\" or \"rebellion.\" The\r\nmovers, however, well understand the difference. At the beginning they\r\nknew they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude by\r\nany name which implies violation of law. They knew their people possessed\r\nas much of moral sense, as much of devotion to law and order, and as much\r\npride in and reverence for the history and government of their common\r\ncountry as any other civilized and patriotic people. They knew they\r\ncould make no advancement directly in the teeth of these strong and noble\r\nsentiments. Accordingly, they commenced by an insidious debauching of the\r\npublic mind. They invented an ingenious sophism which, if conceded, was\r\nfollowed by perfectly logical steps, through all the incidents, to the\r\ncomplete destruction of the Union. The sophism itself is that any State of\r\nthe Union may consistently with the national Constitution, and therefore\r\nlawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the Union without the consent of\r\nthe Union or of any other State. The little disguise that the supposed\r\nright is to be exercised only for just cause, themselves to be the sole\r\njudges of its justice, is too thin to merit any notice.\r\n\r\nWith rebellion thus sugar-coated they have been drugging the public mind\r\nof their section for more than thirty years, and until at length they\r\nhave brought many good men to a willingness to take up arms against the\r\ngovernment the day after some assemblage of men have enacted the farcical\r\npretense of taking their State out of the Union, who could have been\r\nbrought to no such thing the day before.\r\n\r\nThis sophism derives much, perhaps the whole, of its currency from the\r\nassumption that there is some omnipotent and sacred supremacy pertaining\r\nto a State--to each State of our Federal Union. Our States have neither\r\nmore nor less power than that reserved to them in the Union by the\r\nConstitution--no one of them ever having been a State out of the Union.\r\nThe original ones passed into the Union even before they cast off their\r\nBritish colonial dependence; and the new ones each came into the Union\r\ndirectly from a condition of dependence, excepting Texas. And even Texas\r\nin its temporary independence was never designated a State. The new ones\r\nonly took the designation of States on coming into the Union, while that\r\nname was first adopted for the old ones in and by the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Therein the \"United Colonies\" were declared to be \"free and\r\nindependent States\"; but even then the object plainly was not to declare\r\ntheir independence of one another or of the Union, but directly the\r\ncontrary, as their mutual pledge and their mutual action before, at the\r\ntime, and afterward, abundantly show. The express plighting of faith by\r\neach and all of the original thirteen in the Articles of Confederation,\r\ntwo years later, that the Union shall be perpetual, is most conclusive.\r\nHaving never been States either in substance or in name outside of the\r\nUnion, whence this magical omnipotence of \"State rights,\" asserting a\r\nclaim of power to lawfully destroy the Union itself? Much is said about\r\nthe \"sovereignty\" of the States; but the word even is not in the national\r\nConstitution, nor, as is believed, in any of the State constitutions. What\r\nis \"sovereignty\" in the political sense of the term? Would it be far wrong\r\nto define it as \"a political community without a political superior\"?\r\nTested by this, no one of our States except Texas ever was a sovereignty.\r\nAnd even Texas gave up the character on coming into the Union; by which\r\nact she acknowledged the Constitution of the United States, and the laws\r\nand treaties of the United States made in pursuance of the Constitution,\r\nto be for her the supreme law of the land. The States have their status in\r\nthe Union, and they have no other legal status. If they break from this,\r\nthey can only do so against law and by revolution. The Union, and not\r\nthemselves separately, procured their independence and their liberty. By\r\nconquest or purchase the Union gave each of them whatever of independence\r\nor liberty it has. The Union is older than any of the States, and, in\r\nfact, it created them as States. Originally some dependent colonies made\r\nthe Union, and, in turn, the Union threw off their old dependence for\r\nthem, and made them States, such as they are. Not one of them ever had\r\na State constitution independent of the Union. Of course, it is not\r\nforgotten that all the new States framed their constitutions before they\r\nentered the Union nevertheless, dependent upon and preparatory to coming\r\ninto the Union.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the States have the powers and rights reserved to them in\r\nand by the national Constitution; but among these surely are not included\r\nall conceivable powers, however mischievous or destructive, but, at most,\r\nsuch only as were known in the world at the time as governmental powers;\r\nand certainly a power to destroy the government itself had never been\r\nknown as a governmental, as a merely administrative power. This relative\r\nmatter of national power and State rights, as a principle, is no other\r\nthan the principle of generality and locality. Whatever concerns the whole\r\nshould be confided to the whole--to the General Government; while whatever\r\nconcerns only the State should be left exclusively to the State. This\r\nis all there is of original principle about it. Whether the national\r\nConstitution in defining boundaries between the two has applied the\r\nprinciple with exact accuracy, is not to be questioned. We are all bound\r\nby that defining, without question.\r\n\r\nWhat is now combated is the position that secession is consistent with the\r\nConstitution--is lawful and peaceful. It is not contended that there is\r\nany express law for it; and nothing should ever be implied as law which\r\nleads to unjust or absurd consequences. The nation purchased with money\r\nthe countries out of which several of these States were formed. Is it just\r\nthat they shall go off without leave and without refunding? The nation\r\npaid very large sums (in the aggregate, I believe, nearly a hundred\r\nmillions) to relieve Florida of the aboriginal tribes. Is it just that she\r\nshall now be off without consent or without making any return? The\r\nnation is now in debt for money applied to the benefit of these so-called\r\nseceding States in common with the rest. Is it just either that creditors\r\nshall go unpaid or the remaining States pay the whole? A part of the\r\npresent national debt was contracted to pay the old debts of Texas. Is it\r\njust that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself?\r\n\r\nAgain, if one State may secede, so may another; and when all shall have\r\nseceded, none is left to pay the debts. Is this quite just for creditors?\r\nDid we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?\r\nIf we now recognize this doctrine by allowing the seceders to go in peace,\r\nit is difficult to see what we can do if others choose to go or to extort\r\nterms upon which they will promise to remain.\r\n\r\nThe seceders insist that our Constitution admits of secession. They\r\nhave assumed to make a national constitution of their own, in which of\r\nnecessity they have either discarded or retained the right of secession\r\nas they insist it exists in ours. If they have discarded it, they thereby\r\nadmit that on principle it ought not to be in ours. If they have retained\r\nit, by their own construction of ours, they show that to be consistent\r\nthey must secede from one another whenever they shall find it the easiest\r\nway of settling their debts, or effecting any other selfish or unjust\r\nobject. The principle itself is one of disintegration and upon which no\r\ngovernment can possibly endure.\r\n\r\nIf all the States save one should assert the power to drive that one out\r\nof the Union, it is presumed the whole class of seceder politicians would\r\nat once deny the power and denounce the act as the greatest outrage upon\r\nState rights. But suppose that precisely the same act, instead of being\r\ncalled \"driving the one out,\" should be called \"the seceding of the others\r\nfrom that one,\" it would be exactly what the seceders claim to do, unless,\r\nindeed, they make the point that the one, because it is a minority,\r\nmay rightfully do what the others, because they are a majority, may not\r\nrightfully do. These politicians are subtle and profound on the rights of\r\nminorities. They are not partial to that power which made the Constitution\r\nand speaks from the preamble calling itself \"We, the People.\"\r\n\r\nIt may well be questioned whether there is to-day a majority of the\r\nlegally qualified voters of any State except perhaps South Carolina in\r\nfavor of disunion. There is much reason to believe that the Union men are\r\nthe majority in many, if not in every other one, of the so-called seceded\r\nStates. The contrary has not been demonstrated in any one of them. It is\r\nventured to affirm this even of Virginia and Tennessee; for the result of\r\nan election held in military camps, where the bayonets are all on one side\r\nof the question voted upon, can scarcely be considered as demonstrating\r\npopular sentiment. At such an election, all that large class who are at\r\nonce for the Union and against coercion would be coerced to vote against\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nIt may be affirmed without extravagance that the free institutions we\r\nenjoy have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole\r\npeople beyond any example in the world. Of this we now have a striking and\r\nan impressive illustration. So large an army as the government has now on\r\nfoot was never before known without a soldier in it but who has taken his\r\nplace there of his own free choice. But more than this, there are many\r\nsingle regiments whose members, one and another, possess full practical\r\nknowledge of all the arts, sciences, professions, and whatever else,\r\nwhether useful or elegant, is known in the world; and there is scarcely\r\none from which there could not be selected a President, a Cabinet, a\r\nCongress, and perhaps a court, abundantly competent to administer the\r\ngovernment itself. Nor do I say this is not true also in the army of\r\nour late friends, now adversaries in this contest; but if it is, so much\r\nbetter the reason why the government which has conferred such benefits on\r\nboth them and us should not be broken up. Whoever in any section proposes\r\nto abandon such a government would do well to consider in deference to\r\nwhat principle it is that he does it; what better he is likely to get in\r\nits stead; whether the substitute will give, or be intended to give, so\r\nmuch of good to the people. There are some foreshadowings on this subject.\r\nOur adversaries have adopted some declarations of independence in which,\r\nunlike the good old one, penned by Jefferson, they omit the words \"all\r\nmen are created equal.\" Why? They have adopted a temporary national\r\nconstitution, in the preamble of which, unlike our good old one, signed by\r\nWashington, they omit \"We, the People,\" and substitute, \"We, the deputies\r\nof the sovereign and independent States.\" Why? Why this deliberate\r\npressing out of view the rights of men and the authority of the people?\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a people's contest. On the side of the Union it is\r\na struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of\r\ngovernment whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men to\r\nlift artificial weights from all shoulders; to clear the paths of laudable\r\npursuit for all; to afford all an unfettered start, and a fair chance\r\nin the race of life. Yielding to partial and temporary departures,\r\nfrom necessity; this is the leading object of the government for whose\r\nexistence we contend.\r\n\r\nI am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and appreciate\r\nthis. It is worthy of note that, while in this the government's hour of\r\ntrial large numbers of those in the army and navy who have been favored\r\nwith the offices have resigned and proved false to the hand which had\r\npampered them, not one common soldier or common sailor is known to have\r\ndeserted his flag.\r\n\r\nGreat honor is due to those officers who remained true, despite the\r\nexample of their treacherous associates; but the greatest honor, and most\r\nimportant fact of all, is the unanimous firmness of the common soldiers\r\nand common sailors. To the last man, so far as known, they have\r\nsuccessfully resisted the traitorous efforts of those whose commands,\r\nbut an hour before, they obeyed as absolute law. This is the patriotic\r\ninstinct of the plain people. They understand, without an argument, that\r\nthe destroying of the government which was made by Washington means no\r\ngood to them.\r\n\r\nOur popular government has often been called an experiment. Two points in\r\nit our people have already settled--the successful establishing and\r\nthe successful administering of it. One still remains--its successful\r\nmaintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it. It is\r\nnow for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry\r\nan election can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots are the rightful\r\nand peaceful successors of bullets; and that when ballots have fairly\r\nand constitutionally decided, there can be no successful appeal back\r\nto bullets; that there can be no successful appeal, except to ballots\r\nthemselves, at succeeding elections. Such will be a great lesson of peace:\r\nteaching men that what they cannot take by an election, neither can they\r\ntake it by a war; teaching all the folly of being the beginners of a war.\r\n\r\nLest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as to what is\r\nto be the course of the government toward the Southern States after the\r\nrebellion shall have been suppressed, the executive deems it proper to say\r\nit will be his purpose then, as ever, to be guided by the Constitution and\r\nthe laws; and that he probably will have no different understanding of the\r\npowers and duties of the Federal Government relatively to the rights of\r\nthe States and the people, under the Constitution, than that expressed in\r\nthe inaugural address.\r\n\r\nHe desires to preserve the government, that it may be administered for all\r\nas it was administered by the men who made it. Loyal citizens everywhere\r\nhave the right to claim this of their government, and the government has\r\nno right to withhold or neglect it. It is not perceived that in giving it\r\nthere is any coercion, any conquest, or any subjugation, in any just sense\r\nof those terms.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides, and all the States have accepted the provision,\r\nthat \"the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a\r\nrepublican form of government.\" But if a State may lawfully go out of\r\nthe Union, having done so it may also discard the republican form of\r\ngovernment, so that to prevent its going out is an indispensable means to\r\nthe end of maintaining the guarantee mentioned; and when an end is\r\nlawful and obligatory, the indispensable means to it are also lawful and\r\nobligatory.\r\n\r\nIt was with the deepest regret that the executive found the duty of\r\nemploying the war power in defense of the government forced upon him. He\r\ncould but perform this duty or surrender the existence of the government.\r\nNo compromise by public servants could, in this case, be a cure; not that\r\ncompromises are not often proper, but that no popular government can long\r\nsurvive a marked precedent that those who carry an election can only save\r\nthe government from immediate destruction by giving up the main point upon\r\nwhich the people gave the election. The people themselves, and not their\r\nservants, can safely reverse their own deliberate decisions.\r\n\r\nAs a private citizen the executive could not have consented that these\r\ninstitutions shall perish; much less could he in betrayal of so vast and\r\nso sacred a trust as these free people had confided to him. He felt that\r\nhe had no moral right to shrink, nor even to count the chances of his own\r\nlife, in what might follow. In full view of his great responsibility he\r\nhas, so far, done what he has deemed his duty. You will now, according to\r\nyour own judgment, perform yours. He sincerely hopes that your views and\r\nyour action may so accord with his as to assure all faithful citizens who\r\nhave been disturbed in their rights of a certain and speedy restoration to\r\nthem, under the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nAnd having thus chosen our course, without guile and with pure purpose,\r\nlet us renew our trust in God, and go forward without fear and with manly\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, July 6, 1861.\r\n\r\nHON. SEC. OF INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Please ask the Comr. of Indian Affairs, and of the Gen'l\r\nLand Office to come with you, and see me at once. I want the assistance of\r\nall of you in overhauling the list of appointments a little before I send\r\nthem to the Senate.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th\r\ninstant, requesting a copy of correspondence upon the subject of the\r\nincorporation of the Dominican republic with the Spanish monarchy, I\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of State; to whom the resolution was\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 11, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of correspondence between the Secretary\r\nof State and her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary accredited to this government, relative to the exhibition\r\nof the products of industry of all nations, which is to take place at\r\nLondon in the course of next year. As citizens of the United States may\r\njustly pride themselves upon their proficiency in industrial arts, it is\r\ndesirable that they should have proper facilities toward taking part in\r\nthe exhibition. With this view I recommend such legislation by Congress at\r\nthis session as may be necessary for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 16, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nAs the United States have, in common with Great Britain and France, a deep\r\ninterest in the preservation and development of the fisheries adjacent to\r\nthe northeastern coast and islands of this continent, it seems proper that\r\nwe should concert with the governments of those countries such measures as\r\nmay be conducive to those important objects. With this view I transmit to\r\nCongress a copy of a correspondence between the Secretary of State and\r\nthe British minister here, in which the latter proposes, on behalf of\r\nhis government, the appointment of a joint commission to inquire into\r\nthe matter, in order that such ulterior measures may be adopted as may be\r\nadvisable for the objects proposed. Such legislation recommended as may be\r\nnecessary to enable the executive to provide for a commissioner on behalf\r\nof the United States:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JULY 19, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JULY 19, 1861\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL:\r\n\r\nI have agreed, and do agree, that the two Indian regiments named within\r\nshall be accepted if the act of Congress shall admit it. Let there be no\r\nfurther question about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDA OF MILITARY POLICY SUGGESTED BY THE BULL RUN DEFEAT. JULY 23,\r\n1861\r\n\r\n1. Let the plan for making the blockade effective be pushed forward with\r\nall possible despatch.\r\n\r\n2. Let the volunteer forces at Fort Monroe and vicinity under General\r\nButler be constantly drilled, disciplined, and instructed without more for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\n3. Let Baltimore be held as now, with a gentle but firm and certain hand.\r\n\r\n4. Let the force now under Patterson or Banks be strengthened and made\r\nsecure in its position.\r\n\r\n5.

[Let] General Fremont push forward his organization and operations\r\nin the West as rapidly as possible, giving rather special attention to\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\n7. Let the forces late before Manassas, except the three-months men,\r\nbe reorganized as rapidly as possible in their camps here and about\r\nArlington.\r\n\r\n8. Let the three-months forces who decline to enter the longer service be\r\ndischarged as rapidly as circumstances will permit.\r\n\r\n9.

This done, a joint movement from Cairo on Memphis; and from Cincinnati\r\non East Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., July 24, 1861\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Together with the regiments of three years' volunteers which the\r\ngovernment already has in service in your State, enough to make eight in\r\nall, if tendered in a reasonable time, will be accepted, the new regiments\r\nto be taken, as far as convenient, from the three months' men and officers\r\njust discharged, and to be organized, equipped, and sent forward as fast\r\nas single regiments are ready, On the same terms as were those already in\r\nthe service from that State.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

James\r\nH. Lane, a member of that body from Kansas, has been appointed a\r\nbrigadier-general in the army of the United States, and if so, whether\r\nhe has accepted such appointment, I have the honor to transmit herewith\r\ncertain papers, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which, taken together,\r\nexplain themselves, and which contain all the information I possess upon\r\nthe questions propounded.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention, as shown by my letter of June 20, 1861, to appoint\r\nHon. James H. Lane, of Kansas, a brigadier-general of United States\r\nvolunteers in anticipation of the act of Congress, since passed, for\r\nraising such volunteers; and I have no further knowledge upon the subject,\r\nexcept as derived from the papers herewith enclosed.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, August 5, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CAMERON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, AUGUST 7, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The within paper, as you see, is by HON. John S. Phelps\r\nand HON. Frank P. Blair, Jr., both members of the present Congress from\r\nMissouri. The object is to get up an efficient force of Missourians in the\r\nsouthwestern part of the State. It ought to be done, and Mr. Phelps ought\r\nto have general superintendence of it. I see by a private report to me\r\nfrom the department that eighteen regiments are already accepted from\r\nMissouri. Can it not be arranged that part of them (not yet organized, as\r\nI understand) may be taken from the locality mentioned and put under the\r\ncontrol of Mr. Phelps, and let him have discretion to accept them for a\r\nshorter term than three years--or the war--understanding, however, that\r\nhe will get them for the full term if he can? I hope this can be done,\r\nbecause Mr. Phelps is too zealous and efficient and understands his ground\r\ntoo well for us to lose his service. Of course provision for arming,\r\nequipping, etc., must be made. Mr. Phelps is here, and wishes to carry\r\nhome with him authority for this matter.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF A NATIONAL FAST-DAY, AUGUST 12, 1861.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas a joint committee of both houses of Congress has waited on the\r\nPresident of the United States and requested him to \"recommend a day of\r\npublic humiliation, prayer, and fasting to be observed by the people of\r\nthe United States with religious solemnities and the offering of fervent\r\nsupplications to Almighty God for the safety and welfare of these States,\r\nHis blessings on their arms, and a speedy restoration of peace\"; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is fit and becoming in all people at all times to acknowledge\r\nand revere the supreme government of God, to bow in humble submission to\r\nHis chastisements, to confess and deplore their sins and transgressions in\r\nthe full conviction that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,\r\nand to pray with all fervency and contrition for the pardon of their past\r\noffences and for a blessing upon their present and prospective action; and\r\n\r\nWhereas when our own beloved country, once, by the blessing of God,\r\nunited, prosperous, and happy, is now afflicted with faction and civil\r\nwar, it is peculiarly fit for us to recognize the hand of God in this\r\nterrible visitation, and in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and\r\ncrimes as a nation and as individuals to humble ourselves before Him and\r\nto pray for His mercy-to pray that we may be spared further punishment,\r\nthough most justly deserved, that our arms may be blessed and made\r\neffectual for the re-establishment of order, law, and peace throughout\r\nthe wide extent of our country, and that the inestimable boon of civil and\r\nreligious liberty, earned under His guidance and blessing by the labors\r\nand sufferings of our fathers, may be restored in all its original\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nTherefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do appoint\r\nthe last Thursday in September next as a day of humiliation, prayer, and\r\nfasting for all the people of the nation. And I do earnestly recommend to\r\nall the people, and especially to all ministers and teachers of religion\r\nof all denominations and to all heads of families, to observe and keep\r\nthat day according to their several creeds and modes of worship in all\r\nhumility and with all religious solemnity, to the end that the united\r\nprayer of the nation may ascend to the Throne of Grace and bring down\r\nplentiful blessings upon our country.\r\n\r\n     In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand\r\n     and caused the seal of the United States to\r\n [SEAL.]\r\n     be affixed, this twelfth day of August, A. D.\r\n     1861, and of the independence of the United\r\n     States of America the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n By the President: WILLIAM H.

JAMES POLLOCK.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--You must make a job for the bearer of this--make a job of it\r\nwith the collector and have it done. You can do it for me and you must.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR O. P.

Get such harness as may be necessary for your\r\nrifled gums. Do not delay a single regiment, but hasten everything forward\r\nas soon as any one regiment is ready. Have your three additional regiments\r\norganized at once. We shall endeavor to send you the arms this week.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION FORBIDDING INTERCOURSE WITH REBEL STATES, AUGUST 16, 1861.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas on the fifteenth day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-one,\r\nthe President of the United States, in view of an insurrection against the\r\nlaws, Constitution, and government of the United States which had broken\r\nout within the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and in pursuance of the provisions\r\nof the act entitled \"An act to provide for calling forth the militia\r\nto execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel\r\ninvasions, and to repeal the act now in force for that purpose,\" approved\r\nFebruary twenty-eighth, seventeen hundred and ninety-five, did call forth\r\nthe militia to suppress said insurrection, and to cause the laws of the\r\nUnion to be duly executed, and the insurgents have failed to disperse\r\nby the time directed by the President; and whereas such insurrection\r\nhas since broken out and yet exists within the States of Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas; and whereas the insurgents in all the\r\nsaid States claim to act under the authority thereof, and such claim is\r\nnot disclaimed or repudiated by the persons exercising the functions of\r\ngovernment in such State or States, or in the part or parts thereof in\r\nwhich such combinations exist, nor has such insurrection been suppressed\r\nby said States:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, in\r\npursuance of an act of Congress approved July thirteen, eighteen hundred\r\nand sixty-one, do hereby declare that the inhabitants of the said States\r\nof Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,\r\nAlabama, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida (except\r\nthe inhabitants of that part of the State of Virginia lying west of the\r\nAllegheny Mountains, and of such other parts of that State, and the other\r\nStates hereinbefore named, as may maintain a loyal adhesion to the Union\r\nand the Constitution, or may be time to time occupied and controlled by\r\nforces of the United States engaged in the dispersion of said insurgents),\r\nare in a state of insurrection against the United States, and that all\r\ncommercial intercourse between the same and the inhabitants thereof, with\r\nthe exceptions aforesaid, and the citizens of other States and other parts\r\nof the United States, is unlawful, and will remain unlawful until such\r\ninsurrection shall cease or has been suppressed; that all goods and\r\nchattels, wares and merchandise, coming from any of said States, with the\r\nexceptions aforesaid, into other parts of the United States, without the\r\nspecial license and permission of the President, through the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, or proceeding to any of said States, with the exceptions\r\naforesaid, by land or water, together with the vessel or vehicle\r\nconveying the same, or conveying persons to or from said States, with\r\nsaid exceptions, will be forfeited to the United States; and that from\r\nand after fifteen days from the issuing of this proclamation all ships and\r\nvessels belonging in whole or in part to any citizen or inhabitant of any\r\nof said States, with said exceptions, found at sea, or in any port of the\r\nUnited States, will be forfeited to the United States; and I hereby enjoin\r\nupon all district attorneys, marshals, and officers of the revenue and of\r\nthe military and naval forces of the United States to be vigilant in\r\nthe execution of said act, and in the enforcement of the penalties and\r\nforfeitures imposed or declared by it; leaving any party who may think\r\nhimself aggrieved thereby to his application to the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury for the remission of any penalty or forfeiture, which the said\r\nSecretary is authorized by law to grant if, in his judgment, the special\r\ncircumstances of any case shall require such remission.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand,....\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:   WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of Sate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CAMERON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, August 17, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Unless there be reason to the contrary, not known to\r\nme, make out a commission for Simon B. Buckner, of Kentucky, as a\r\nbrigadier-general of volunteers. It is to be put into the hands of General\r\nAnderson, and delivered to General Buckner or not, at the discretion of\r\nGeneral Anderson. Of course it is to remain a secret unless and until the\r\ncommission is delivered.\r\n\r\nYours truly, A. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nSame day made.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MAGOFFIN,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., AUGUST 24, 1861\r\n\r\nTo HIS EXCELLENCY B. MAGOFFIN, Governor of the State of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Your letter of the 19th instant, in which you urge the \"removal from\r\nthe limits of Kentucky of the military force now organized and in camp\r\nwithin that State,\" is received.\r\n\r\nI may not possess full and precisely accurate knowledge upon this subject;\r\nbut I believe it is true that there is a military force in camp within\r\nKentucky, acting by authority of the United States, which force is not\r\nvery large, and is not now being augmented.\r\n\r\nI also believe that some arms have been furnished to this force by the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI also believe this force consists exclusively of Kentuckians, having\r\ntheir camp in the immediate vicinity of their own homes, and not assailing\r\nor menacing any of the good people of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nIn all I have done in the premises I have acted upon the urgent\r\nsolicitation of many Kentuckians, and in accordance with what I believed,\r\nand still believe, to be the wish of a majority of all the Union-loving\r\npeople of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nWhile I have conversed on this subject with many eminent men of Kentucky,\r\nincluding a large majority of her members of Congress, I do not remember\r\nthat any one of them, or any other person, except your Excellency and the\r\nbearers of your Excellency's letter, has urged me to remove the military\r\nforce from Kentucky or to disband it. One other very worthy citizen of\r\nKentucky did solicit me to have the augmenting of the force suspended for\r\na time.\r\n\r\nTaking all the means within my reach to form a judgment, I do not believe\r\nit is the popular wish of Kentucky that this force shall be removed beyond\r\nher limits; and, with this impression, I must respectfully decline to so\r\nremove it.\r\n\r\nI most cordially sympathize with your Excellency in the wish to preserve\r\nthe peace of my own native State, Kentucky. It is with regret I search,\r\nand cannot find, in your not very short letter, any declaration or\r\nintimation that you entertain any desire for the preservation of the\r\nFederal Union.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., SEPTEMBER 2, 1861\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Two points in your proclamation of August 30 give me some\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nFirst. Should you shoot a man, according to the proclamation, the\r\nConfederates would very certainly shoot our best men in their hands in\r\nretaliation; and so, man for man, indefinitely. It is, therefore, my order\r\nthat you allow no man to be shot under the proclamation without first\r\nhaving my approbation or consent.\r\n\r\nSecond. I think there is great danger that the closing paragraph, in\r\nrelation to the confiscation of property and the liberating slaves of\r\ntraitorous owners, will alarm our Southern Union friends and turn them\r\nagainst us; perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky. Allow\r\nme, therefore, to ask that you will, as of your own motion, modify that\r\nparagraph so as to conform to the first and fourth sections of the act of\r\nCongress entitled \"An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary\r\npurposes,\" approved August 6, 1861, and a copy of which act I herewith\r\nsend you.\r\n\r\nThis letter is written in a spirit of caution, and not of censure. I send\r\nit by special messenger, in order that it may certainly and speedily reach\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNORS\r\n\r\nWASHBURN OF MAINE, FAIRBANKS OF VERMONT, BERRY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, ANDREW OF\r\nMASSACHUSETTS, BUCKINGHAM OF CONNECTICUT, AND SPRAGUE OF RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, September 11, 1861.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler proposes raising in New England six regiments, to be\r\nrecruited and commanded by himself, and to go on special service.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad if you, as governor of ------, will answer by telegraph if\r\nyou consent.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., SEPTEMBER 11, 1861\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL JOHN C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nSIR:-Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2d instant, is just\r\nreceived. Assuming that you, upon the ground, could better judge of the\r\nnecessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing\r\nyour proclamation of August 30 I perceived no general objection to it. The\r\nparticular clause, however, in relation to the confiscation of property\r\nand the liberation of slaves appeared to me to be objectionable in its\r\nnonconformity to the act of Congress passed the 6th of last August upon\r\nthe same subjects; and hence I wrote you, expressing my wish that that\r\nclause should be modified accordingly. Your answer, just received,\r\nexpresses the preference on your part that I should make an open order for\r\nthe modification, which I very cheerfully do. It is therefore ordered that\r\nthe said clause of said proclamation be so modified, held, and construed\r\nas to conform to, and not to transcend, the provisions on the same subject\r\ncontained in the act of Congress entitled \"An act to confiscate property\r\nused for insurrectionary purposes,\" approved August 6, 1861, and that said\r\nact be published at length with this order.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 12, 1861\r\n\r\nMrs. GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MADAM:--Your two notes of to-day are before me. I answered the\r\nletter you bore me from General Fremont on yesterday, and not hearing from\r\nyou during the day, I sent the answer to him by mail. It is not exactly\r\ncorrect, as you say you were told by the elder Mr. Blair, to say that I\r\nsent Postmaster-General Blair to St. Louis to examine into that department\r\nand report. Postmaster-General Blair did go, with my approbation, to see\r\nand converse with General Fremont as a friend. I do not feel authorized to\r\nfurnish you with copies of letters in my possession without the consent of\r\nthe writers. No impression has been made on my mind against the honor or\r\nintegrity of General Fremont, and I now enter my protest against being\r\nunderstood as acting in any hostility toward him.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH HOLT,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, SEPTEMBER 12, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. JOSEPH HOLT.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of this day in relation to the late proclamation of\r\nGeneral Fremont is received yesterday I addressed a letter to him, by\r\nmail, on the same subject, and which is to be made public when he receives\r\nit. I herewith send you a copy of that letter, which perhaps shows my\r\nposition as distinctly as any new one I could write. I will thank you not\r\nto make it public until General Fremont shall have had time to receive the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SCOTT\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 16, 1861.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Since conversing with you I have concluded to request you\r\nto frame an order for recruiting North Carolinians at Fort Hatteras. I\r\nsuggest it to be so framed as for us to accept a smaller force--even a\r\ncompany--if we cannot get a regiment or more. What is necessary to now\r\nsay about officers you will judge. Governor Seward says he has a nephew\r\n(Clarence A. Seward, I believe) who would be willing to go and play\r\ncolonel and assist in raising the force. Still it is to be considered\r\nwhether the North Carolinians will not prefer officers of their own. I\r\nshould expect they would.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CAMERON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, September 18, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR. MY DEAR SIR:--To guard against misunderstanding,\r\nI think fit to say that the joint expedition of the army and navy agreed\r\nupon some time since, and in which General T. W. Sherman was and is to\r\nbear a conspicuous part, is in no wise to be abandoned, but must be ready\r\nto move by the 1st of, or very early in, October. Let all preparations go\r\nforward accordingly.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL FREMONT,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER 12, 1861\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nGovernor Morton telegraphs as follows: \"Colonel Lane, just arrived by\r\nspecial train, represents Owensborough, forty miles above Evansville, in\r\npossession of secessionists. Green River is navigable. Owensborough must\r\nbe seized. We want a gunboat sent up from Paducah for that purpose.\" Send\r\nup the gunboat if, in your discretion, you think it right. Perhaps you had\r\nbetter order those in charge of the Ohio River to guard it vigilantly at\r\nall points.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo O. H. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON SEPTEMBER 22, 1861\r\n\r\nHON. O. H. BROWNING.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 17th is just received; and coming from you, I\r\nconfess it astonishes me. That you should object to my adhering to a law\r\nwhich you had assisted in making and presenting to me less than a month\r\nbefore is odd enough. But this is a very small part. General Fremont's\r\nproclamation as to confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves\r\nis purely political and not within the range of military law or necessity.\r\nIf a commanding general finds a necessity to seize the farm of a private\r\nowner for a pasture, an encampment, or a fortification, he has the right\r\nto do so, and to so hold it as long as the necessity lasts; and this is\r\nwithin military law, because within military necessity. But to say the\r\nfarm shall no longer belong to the owner, or his heirs forever, and this\r\nas well when the farm is not needed for military purposes as when it is,\r\nis purely political, without the savor of military law about it. And the\r\nsame is true of slaves. If the general needs them, he can seize them\r\nand use them; but when the need is past, it is not for him to fix their\r\npermanent future condition. That must be settled according to laws made\r\nby law-makers, and not by military proclamations. The proclamation in the\r\npoint in question is simply \"dictatorship.\" It assumes that the general\r\nmay do anything he pleases confiscate the lands and free the slaves of\r\nloyal people, as well as of disloyal ones. And going the whole figure,\r\nI have no doubt, would be more popular with some thoughtless people than\r\nthat which has been done, But I cannot assume this reckless position, nor\r\nallow others to assume it on my responsibility.\r\n\r\nYou speak of it as being the only means of saving the government. On\r\nthe contrary, it is itself the surrender of the government. Can it be\r\npretended that it is any longer the Government of the United States--any\r\ngovernment of constitution and laws wherein a general or a president may\r\nmake permanent rules of property by proclamation? I do not say Congress\r\nmight not with propriety pass a law on the point, just such as General\r\nFremont proclaimed.\r\n\r\nI do not say I might not, as a member of Congress, vote for it. What I\r\nobject to is, that I, as President, shall expressly or impliedly seize and\r\nexercise the permanent legislative functions of the government.\r\n\r\nSo much as to principle. Now as to policy. No doubt the thing was popular\r\nin some quarters, and would have been more so if it had been a general\r\ndeclaration of emancipation. The Kentucky Legislature would not budge till\r\nthat proclamation was modified; and General Anderson telegraphed me\r\nthat on the news of General Fremont having actually issued deeds of\r\nmanumission, a whole company of our volunteers threw down their arms and\r\ndisbanded. I was so assured as to think it probable that the very arms\r\nwe had furnished Kentucky would be turned against us. I think to lose\r\nKentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game. Kentucky gone, we\r\ncannot hold Missouri, nor, as I think, Maryland. These all against us,\r\nand the job on our hands is too large for us. We would as well consent\r\nto separation at once, including the surrender of this Capital. On the\r\ncontrary, if you will give up your restlessness for new positions, and\r\nback me manfully on the grounds upon which you and other kind friends\r\ngave me the election and have approved in my public documents, we shall\r\ngo through triumphantly. You must not understand I took my course on the\r\nproclamation because of Kentucky. I took the same ground in a private\r\nletter to General Fremont before I heard from Kentucky.\r\n\r\nYou think I am inconsistent because I did not also forbid General Fremont\r\nto shoot men under the proclamation. I understand that part to be within\r\nmilitary law, but I also think, and so privately wrote General Fremont,\r\nthat it is impolitic in this, that our adversaries have the power, and\r\nwill certainly exercise it, to shoot as many of our men as we shoot of\r\ntheirs. I did not say this in the public letter, because it is a subject I\r\nprefer not to discuss in the hearing of our enemies.\r\n\r\nThere has been no thought of removing General Fremont on any ground\r\nconnected with his proclamation, and if there has been any wish for his\r\nremoval on any ground, our mutual friend Sam. Glover can probably tell you\r\nwhat it was. I hope no real necessity for it exists on any ground.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM FOR A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n[OCTOBER 1?] 1861\r\n\r\nOn or about the 5th of October (the exact date to be determined hereafter)\r\nI wish a movement made to seize and hold a point on the railroad\r\nconnecting Virginia and Tennessee near the mountain-pass called Cumberland\r\nGap. That point is now guarded against us by Zollicoffer, with 6000 or\r\n8000 rebels at Barboursville Ky.,--say twenty-five miles from the Gap,\r\ntoward Lexington. We have a force of 5000 or 6000 under General Thomas,\r\nat Camp Dick Robinson, about twenty-five miles from Lexington and\r\nseventy-five from Zollicoffer's camp, On the road between the two. There\r\nis not a railroad anywhere between Lexington and the point to be seized,\r\nand along the whole length of which the Union sentiment among the people\r\nlargely predominates. We have military possession of the railroad from\r\nCincinnati to Lexington, and from Louisville to Lexington, and some\r\nhome guards, under General Crittenden, are on the latter line. We have\r\npossession of the railroad from Louisville to Nashville, Tenn., so far\r\nas Muldraugh's Hill, about forty miles, and the rebels have possession of\r\nthat road all south of there. At the Hill we have a force of 8000, under\r\nGeneral Sherman, and about an equal force of rebels is a very short\r\ndistance south, under General Buckner.\r\n\r\nWe have a large force at Paducah, and a smaller at Port Holt, both on the\r\nKentucky side, with some at Bird's Point, Cairo, Mound City, Evansville,\r\nand New Albany, all on the other side, and all which, with the gunboats on\r\nthe river, are perhaps sufficient to guard the Ohio from Louisville to its\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nAbout supplies of troops, my general idea is that all from Wisconsin,\r\nMinnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas, not now elsewhere, be\r\nleft to Fremont. All from Indiana and Michigan, not now elsewhere, be sent\r\nto Anderson at Louisville. All from Ohio needed in western Virginia be\r\nsent there, and any remainder be sent to Mitchell at Cincinnati, for\r\nAnderson. All east of the mountains be appropriated to McClellan and to\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nAs to movements, my idea is that the one for the coast and that on\r\nCumberland Gap be simultaneous, and that in the meantime preparation,\r\nvigilant watching, and the defensive only be acted upon; this, however,\r\nnot to apply to Fremont's operations in northern and middle Missouri. That\r\nbefore these movements Thomas and Sherman shall respectively watch but\r\nnot attack Zollicoffer and Buckner. That when the coast and Gap movements\r\nshall be ready Sherman is merely to stand fast, while all at Cincinnati\r\nand all at Louisville, with all on the line, concentrate rapidly at\r\nLexington, and thence to Thomas's camp, joining him, and the whole thence\r\nupon the Gap. It is for the military men to decide whether they can find a\r\npass through the mountains at or near the Gap which cannot be defended by\r\nthe enemy with a greatly inferior force, and what is to be done in regard\r\nto this.\r\n\r\nThe coast and Gap movements made, Generals McClellan and Fremont, in\r\ntheir respective departments, will avail themselves of any advantages the\r\ndiversions may present.\r\n\r\n[He was entirely unable to get this started, Sherman would have taken\r\nan active part if given him, the others were too busy getting lines of\r\ncommunication guarded--and discovering many \"critical\" supply items that\r\nhad not been sent them. Also the commanding general did not like it.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n(General Orders No. 18.) HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, October 24, 1861\r\n\r\nMajor-General Fremont, of the United States Army, the present commander\r\nof the Western Department of the same, will, on the receipt of this order,\r\ncall Major-General Hunter, of the United States Volunteers, to relieve him\r\ntemporarily in that command, when he (Major-General Fremont) will report\r\nto general headquarters by letter for further orders.\r\n\r\nWINFIELD SCOTT. By command: E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, October 24, 1861\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE WEST.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The command of the Department of the West having devolved upon you,\r\nI propose to offer you a few suggestions. Knowing how hazardous it is\r\nto bind down a distant commander in the field to specific lines and\r\noperations, as so much always depends on a knowledge of localities and\r\npassing events, it is intended, therefore, to leave a considerable margin\r\nfor the exercise of your judgment and discretion.\r\n\r\nThe main rebel army (Price's) west of the Mississippi is believed to have\r\npassed Dade County in full retreat upon northwestern Arkansas, leaving\r\nMissouri almost freed from the enemy, excepting in the southeast of the\r\nState. Assuming this basis of fact, it seems desirable, as you are not\r\nlikely to overtake Price, and are in danger of making too long a line from\r\nyour own base of supplies and reinforcements, that you should give up the\r\npursuit, halt your main army, divide it into two corps of observation, one\r\noccupying Sedalia and the other Rolla, the present termini of railroads;\r\nthen recruit the condition of both corps by re-establishing and improving\r\ntheir discipline and instructions, perfecting their clothing and\r\nequipments, and providing less uncomfortable quarters. Of course, both\r\nrailroads must be guarded and kept open, judiciously employing just so\r\nmuch force as is necessary for this. From these two points, Sedalia and\r\nRolla, and especially in judicious cooperation with Lane on the Kansas\r\nborder, it would be so easy to concentrate and repel any army of the enemy\r\nreturning on Missouri from the southwest, that it is not probable any such\r\nattempt will be made before or during the approaching cold weather. Before\r\nspring the people of Missouri will probably be in no favorable mood\r\nto renew for next year the troubles which have so much afflicted and\r\nimpoverished them during this. If you adopt this line of policy, and if,\r\nas I anticipate, you will see no enemy in great force approaching, you\r\nwill have a surplus of force which you can withdraw from these points and\r\ndirect to others as may be needed, the railroads furnishing ready means\r\nof reinforcing these main points if occasion requires. Doubtless local\r\nuprisings will for a time continue to occur, but these can be met by\r\ndetachments and local forces of our own, and will ere long tire out of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWhile, as stated in the beginning of the letter, a large discretion must\r\nbe and is left with yourself, I feel sure that an indefinite pursuit of\r\nPrice or an attempt by this long and circuitous route to reach Memphis\r\nwill be exhaustive beyond endurance, and will end in the loss of the whole\r\nforce engaged in it.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER RETIRING GENERAL SCOTT AND APPOINTING\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN HIS SUCCESSOR. (General Orders, No.94.)\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 1, 1861\r\n\r\nThe following order from the President of the United States, announcing\r\nthe retirement from active command of the honored veteran Lieutenant\r\ngeneral Winfield Scott, will be read by the army with profound regret:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 1861\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of November, A.D. 1861, upon his own application to the\r\nPresident of the United States, Brevet Lieutenant-General Winfield Scott\r\nis ordered to be placed, and hereby is placed, upon the list of retired\r\nofficers of the army of the United States, without reduction in his\r\ncurrent pay, subsistence, or allowances.\r\n\r\nThe American people will hear with sadness and deep emotion that General\r\nScott has withdrawn from the active control of the army, while the\r\nPresident and a unanimous Cabinet express their own and the nation's\r\nsympathy in his personal affliction and their profound sense of the\r\nimportant public services rendered by him to his country during his long\r\nand brilliant career, among which will ever be gratefully distinguished\r\nhis faithful devotion to the Constitution, the Union, and the flag when\r\nassailed by parricidal rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President is pleased to direct that Major general George B. McClellan\r\nassume the command of the army of the United States. The headquarters of\r\nthe army will be established in the city of Washington. All communications\r\nintended for the commanding general will hereafter be addressed direct\r\nto the adjutant-general. The duplicate returns, orders, and other papers\r\nheretofore sent to the assistant adjutant-general, headquarters of the\r\narmy, will be discontinued.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:  L. THOMAS, Adjutant General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER APPROVING THE PLAN OF GOVERNOR GAMBLE OF MISSOURI.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nNovember 5, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of the State of Missouri, acting under the direction of the\r\nconvention of that State, proposes to the Government of the United States\r\nthat he will raise a military force to serve within the State as State\r\nmilitia during the war there, to cooperate with the troops in the\r\nservice of the United States in repelling the invasion of the State and\r\nsuppressing rebellion therein; the said State militia to be embodied\r\nand to be held in the camp and in the field, drilled, disciplined, and\r\ngoverned according to the Army Regulations and subject to the Articles of\r\nWar; the said State militia not to be ordered out of the State except for\r\nthe immediate defense of the State of Missouri, but to co-operate with the\r\ntroops in the service of the United States in military operations within\r\nthe State or necessary to its defense, and when officers of the State\r\nmilitia act with officers in the service of the United States of the same\r\ngrade the officers of the United States service shall command the combined\r\nforce; the State militia to be armed, equipped, clothed, subsisted,\r\ntransported, and paid by the United States during such time as they shall\r\nbe actually engaged as an embodied military force in service in accordance\r\nwith regulations of the United States Army or general orders as issued\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nIn order that the Treasury of the United States may not be burdened with\r\nthe pay of unnecessary officers, the governor proposes that, although\r\nthe State law requires him to appoint upon the general staff an\r\nadjutant-general, a commissary-general, an inspector-general, a\r\nquartermaster-general, a paymaster-general, and a surgeon-general, each\r\nwith the rank of colonel of cavalry, yet he proposes that the\r\nGovernment of the United States pay only the adjutant-general, the\r\nquartermaster-general, and inspector-general, their services being\r\nnecessary in the relations which would exist between the State militia and\r\nthe United States. The governor further proposes that while he is\r\nallowed by the State law to appoint aides-de-camp to the governor at his\r\ndiscretion, with the rank of colonel, three only shall be reported to the\r\nUnited States for payment. He also proposes that the State militia\r\nshall be commanded by a single major-general and by such number of\r\nbrigadier-generals as shall allow one for a brigade of not less than four\r\nregiments, and that no greater number of staff officers shall be appointed\r\nfor regimental, brigade, and division duties than as provided for in the\r\nact of Congress of the 22d July, 1861; and that, whatever be the rank of\r\nsuch officers as fixed by the law of the State, the compensation that they\r\nshall receive from the United States shall only be that which belongs to\r\nthe rank given by said act of Congress to officers in the United States\r\nservice performing the same duties.\r\n\r\nThe field officers of a regiment in the State militia are one colonel, one\r\nlieutenant-colonel, and one major, and the company officers are a captain,\r\na first lieutenant, and a second lieutenant. The governor proposes that,\r\nas the money to be disbursed is the money of the United States, such staff\r\nofficers in the service of the United States as may be necessary to act\r\nas disbursing officers for the State militia shall be assigned by the War\r\nDepartment for that duty; or, if such cannot be spared from their present\r\nduty, he will appoint such persons disbursing officers for the State\r\nmilitia as the President of the United States may designate. Such\r\nregulations as may be required, in the judgment of the President, to\r\ninsure regularity of returns and to protect the United States from any\r\nfraudulent practices shall be observed and obeyed by all in office in the\r\nState militia.\r\n\r\nThe above propositions are accepted on the part of the United States, and\r\nthe Secretary of War is directed to make the necessary orders upon the\r\nOrdnance, Quartermaster's, Commissary, Pay, and Medical departments\r\nto carry this agreement into effect. He will cause the necessary\r\nstaff officers in the United States service to be detailed for duty in\r\nconnection with the Missouri State militia, and will order them to make\r\nthe necessary provision in their respective offices for fulfilling this\r\nagreement. All requisitions upon the different officers of the United\r\nStates under this agreement to be made in substance in the same mode for\r\nthe Missouri State militia as similar requisitions are made for troops in\r\nthe service of the United States; and the Secretary of War will cause\r\nany additional regulations that may be necessary to insure regularity\r\nand economy in carrying this agreement into effect to be adopted and\r\ncommunicated to the Governor of Missouri for the government of the\r\nMissouri State militia.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nNovember 6, 1861.\r\n\r\nThis plan approved, with the modification that the governor stipulates\r\nthat when he commissions a major-general of militia it shall be the same\r\nperson at the time in command of the United States Department of the\r\nWest; and in case the United States shall change such commander of the\r\ndepartment, he (the governor) will revoke the State commission given to\r\nthe person relieved and give one to the person substituted to the United\r\nStates command of said department.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE MINISTER FROM SWEDEN.\r\n\r\nNovember 8, 1861.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I receive with great pleasure a Minister from Sweden. That pleasure\r\nis enhanced by the information which preceded your arrival here, that his\r\nMajesty, your sovereign, had selected you to fill the mission upon the\r\ngrounds of your derivation from an ancestral stock identified with the\r\nmost glorious era of your country's noble history, and your own eminent\r\nsocial and political standing in Sweden. This country, sir, maintains, and\r\nmeans to maintain, the rights of human nature, and the capacity of men for\r\nself-government. The history of Sweden proves that this is the faith of\r\nthe people of Sweden, and we know that it is the faith and practice of\r\ntheir respected sovereign. Rest assured, therefore, that we shall be found\r\nalways just and paternal in our transactions with your government, and\r\nthat nothing will be omitted on my part to make your residence in this\r\ncapital agreeable to yourself and satisfactory to your government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT AUTHORIZING MARTIAL LAW IN SAINT LOUIS.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, November 20, 1861. (Received Nov. 20th.)\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN,\r\n\r\nFor the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nNo written authority is found here to declare and enforce martial law in\r\nthis department. Please send me such written authority and telegraph me\r\nthat it has been sent by mail.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.] November 21, 1861.\r\n\r\nIf General McClellan and General Halleck deem it necessary to declare and\r\nmaintain martial law in Saint Louis, the same is hereby authorized.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFER TO COOPERATE AND GIVE SPECIAL LINE OF INFORMATION TO HORACE GREELEY\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR WALKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 21, 1861\r\n\r\nDEAR GOVERNOR:--I have thought over the interview which Mr. Gilmore has\r\nhad with Mr. Greeley, and the proposal that Greeley has made to Gilmore,\r\nnamely, that he [Gilmore] shall communicate to him [Greeley] all that he\r\nlearns from you of the inner workings of the administration, in return\r\nfor his [Greeley's] giving such aid as he can to the new magazine, and\r\nallowing you [Walker] from time to time the use of his [Greeley's] columns\r\nwhen it is desirable to feel of, or forestall, public opinion on important\r\nsubjects. The arrangement meets my unqualified approval, and I shall\r\nfurther it to the extent of my ability, by opening to you--as I do\r\nnow--fully the policy of the Government,--its present views and future\r\nintentions when formed, giving you permission to communicate them to\r\nGilmore for Greeley; and in case you go to Europe I will give these\r\nthings direct to Gilmore. But all this must be on the express and explicit\r\nunderstanding that the fact of these communications coming from me shall\r\nbe absolutely confidential,--not to be disclosed by Greeley to his nearest\r\nfriend, or any of his subordinates. He will be, in effect, my mouthpiece,\r\nbut I must not be known to be the speaker.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you that I have the highest confidence in Mr. Greeley. He\r\nis a great power. Having him firmly behind me will be as helpful to me as\r\nan army of one hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\nThis was to be most severely regretted, when Greeley became a traitor\r\nto the cause, editorialized for compromise and separation--and promoted\r\nMcClellan as Democratic candidate for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nThat he has ever kicked the traces has been owing to his not being fully\r\ninformed. Tell Gilmore to say to him that, if he ever objects to my\r\npolicy, I shall be glad to have him state to me his views frankly and\r\nfully. I shall adopt his if I can. If I cannot, I will at least tell him\r\nwhy. He and I should stand together, and let no minor differences come\r\nbetween us; for we both seek one end, which is the saving of our\r\ncountry. Now, Governor, this is a longer letter than I have written in\r\na month,--longer than I would have written for any other man than Horace\r\nGreeley.\r\n\r\nYour friend, truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--The sooner Gilmore sees Greeley the better, as you may before long\r\nthink it wise to ventilate our policy on the Trent affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER AUTHORIZING GENERAL HALLECK TO SUSPEND THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2, 1861.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL H.

HALLECK, Commanding in the Department of Missouri.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--As an insurrection exists in the United States, and is in arms\r\nin the State of Missouri, you are hereby authorized and empowered to\r\nsuspend the writ of habeas corpus within the limits of the military\r\ndivision under your command, and to exercise martial law as you find it\r\nnecessary in your discretion to secure the public safety and the authority\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed at Washington, this second day of December,\r\nA.D. 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 3, 1861\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:--In the midst\r\nof unprecedented political troubles we have cause of great gratitude to\r\nGod for unusual good health and most abundant harvests.\r\n\r\nYou will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of the\r\ntimes our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound\r\nsolicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nA disloyal portion of the American people have during the whole year been\r\nengaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which\r\nendures factious domestic division is exposed to disrespect abroad,\r\nand one party, if not both, is sure sooner or later to invoke foreign\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nNations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the\r\ncounsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition, although measures\r\nadopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious\r\nto those adopting them.\r\n\r\nThe disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of\r\nour country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked\r\nabroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably\r\nexpected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to\r\nassume, that foreign nations in this case, discarding all moral, social,\r\nand treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy\r\nrestoration of commerce, including especially the acquisition of cotton,\r\nthose nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object\r\nmore directly or clearly through the destruction than through the\r\npreservation of the Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign\r\nnations are actuated by no higher principle than this, I am quite sure a\r\nsound argument could be made to show them that they can reach their aim\r\nmore readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving\r\nencouragement to it.\r\n\r\nThe principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign\r\nnations to hostility against us, as already intimated, is the\r\nembarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably saw\r\nfrom the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign as\r\nour domestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive that the\r\neffort for disunion produces the existing difficulty, and that one strong\r\nnation promises more durable peace and a more extensive, valuable, and\r\nreliable commerce than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states,\r\nbecause, whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integrity\r\nof our country and the stability of our government mainly depend not upon\r\nthem, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the\r\nAmerican people. The correspondence itself, with the usual reservations,\r\nis herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nI venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and\r\nliberality toward foreign powers, averting causes of irritation and with\r\nfirmness maintaining our own rights and honor.\r\n\r\nSince, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other state,\r\nforeign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that\r\nadequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defenses\r\non every side. While under this general recommendation provision for\r\ndefending our seacoast line readily occurs to the mind, I also in the same\r\nconnection ask the attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers.\r\nIt is believed that some fortifications and depots of arms and munitions,\r\nwith harbor and navigation improvements, all at well-selected points\r\nupon these, would be of great importance to the national defense and\r\npreservation I ask attention to the views of the Secretary of War,\r\nexpressed in his report, upon the same general subject.\r\n\r\nI deem it of importance that the loyal regions of east Tennessee and\r\nwestern North Carolina should be connected with Kentucky and other\r\nfaithful parts of the Union by rail-road. I therefore recommend, as a\r\nmilitary measure, that Congress provide for the construction of such\r\nrail-road as speedily as possible. Kentucky will no doubt co-operate, and\r\nthrough her Legislature make the most judicious selection of a line. The\r\nnorthern terminus must connect with some existing railroad, and whether\r\nthe route shall be from Lexington or Nicholasville to the Cumberland Gap,\r\nor from Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in the direction of Knoxville, or\r\non some still different line, can easily be determined. Kentucky and the\r\nGeneral Government co-operating, the work can be completed in a very short\r\ntime, and when done it will be not only of vast present usefulness but\r\nalso a valuable permanent improvement, worth its cost in all the future.\r\n\r\nSome treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and having\r\nno grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will be submitted\r\nto the Senate for their consideration.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt\r\na desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war, we have removed all\r\nobstructions from the way of this humane reform except such as are merely\r\nof temporary and accidental occurrence.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the correspondence between her Britannic\r\nMajesty's minister accredited to this government and the Secretary of\r\nState relative to the detention of the British ship Perthshire in June\r\nlast by the United States steamer Massachusetts for a supposed breach\r\nof the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious\r\nmisapprehension of the facts, and as justice requires that we should\r\ncommit no belligerent act not founded in strict right as sanctioned by\r\npublic law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the\r\nreasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his annual message to\r\nCongress in December last in regard to the disposition of the surplus\r\nwhich will probably remain after satisfying the claims of American\r\ncitizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under\r\nthe act of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, it should not be deemed\r\nadvisable to carry that recommendation into effect, I would suggest that\r\nauthority be given for investing the principal, or the proceeds of the\r\nsurplus referred to, in good securities, with a view to the satisfaction\r\nof such other just claims of our citizens against China as are not\r\nunlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nBy the act of the 5th of August last Congress authorized the President to\r\ninstruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against\r\nand to capture pirates. His authority has been exercised in a single\r\ninstance only. For the more effectual protection of our extensive and\r\nvaluable commerce in the Eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it\r\nwould also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to\r\nrecapture any prizes which pirates may make of United States vessels and\r\ntheir cargoes, and the consular courts now established by law in Eastern\r\ncountries to adjudicate the cases in the event that this should not be\r\nobjected to by the local authorities.\r\n\r\nIf any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding\r\nour recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Haiti and Liberia,\r\nI am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel\r\npolicy in regard to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit for\r\nyour consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining\r\na charge d'affaires near each of those new States. It does not admit of\r\ndoubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable\r\ntreaties with them.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the treasury during the period which has elapsed since\r\nyour adjournment have been conducted with signal success. The patriotism\r\nof the people has placed at the disposal of the government the large means\r\ndemanded by the public exigencies. Much of the national loan has been\r\ntaken by citizens of the industrial classes, whose confidence in their\r\ncountry's faith and zeal for their country's deliverance from present\r\nperil have induced them to contribute to the support of the government\r\nthe whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar\r\nobligations to economy in disbursement and energy in action.\r\n\r\nThe revenue from all sources, including loans, for the financial year\r\nending on the 30th of June, 1861, was $86,835,900.27, and the expenditures\r\nfor the same period, including payments on account of the public debt,\r\nwere $84,578,834.47, leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st of July\r\nof $2,257,065.80. For the first quarter of the financial year ending on\r\nthe 30th of September, 1861, the receipts from all sources, including\r\nthe balance of the 1st of July, were $102,532,509.27, and the expenses\r\n$98,239733.09, leaving a balance on the 1st of October, 1861, of\r\n$4,292,776.18.\r\n\r\nEstimates for the remaining three quarters of the year and for the\r\nfinancial year 1863, together with his views of ways and means for meeting\r\nthe demands contemplated by them, will be submitted to Congress by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the expenditures\r\nmade necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of the\r\nloyal people, and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far\r\nsustained the government will continue to sustain it till peace and union\r\nshall again bless the land.\r\n\r\nI respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War for information\r\nrespecting the numerical strength of the army and for recommendations\r\nhaving in view an increase of its efficiency and the well-being of the\r\nvarious branches of the service intrusted to his care. It is gratifying to\r\nknow that the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the occasion,\r\nand that the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which\r\nCongress authorized me to call into the field.\r\n\r\nI refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion\r\nto the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops and\r\nto the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the Secretary for an organization of the militia\r\nupon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to the future safety\r\nof the country, and is commended to the serious attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe large addition to the regular army, in connection with the defection\r\nthat has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives\r\npeculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of\r\ncadets to the greatest capacity of the Military Academy.\r\n\r\nBy mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to provide chaplains for\r\nhospitals occupied by volunteers. This subject was brought to my notice,\r\nand I was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of which,\r\nproperly addressed, has been delivered to each of the persons, and at the\r\ndates respectively named and stated in a schedule, containing also the\r\nform of the letter, marked A, and herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties designated at the\r\ntimes respectively stated in the schedule, and have labored faithfully\r\ntherein ever since. I therefore recommend that they be compensated at\r\nthe same rate as chaplains in the army. I further suggest that general\r\nprovision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals, as well as with\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail the operations\r\nof that branch of the service, the activity and energy which have\r\ncharacterized its administration, and the results of measures to increase\r\nits efficiency and power such have been the additions, by construction and\r\npurchase, that it may almost be said a navy has been created and brought\r\ninto service since our difficulties commenced.\r\n\r\nBesides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than ever before\r\nassembled under our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds which\r\nhave increased our naval renown.\r\n\r\nI would invite special attention to the recommendation of the Secretary\r\nfor a more perfect organization of the navy by introducing additional\r\ngrades in the service.\r\n\r\nThe present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and the\r\nsuggestions submitted by the department will, it is believed, if adopted,\r\nobviate the difficulties alluded to, promote harmony, and increase the\r\nefficiency of the navy.\r\n\r\nThere are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court--two by\r\nthe decease of Justices Daniel and McLean and one by the resignation of\r\nJustice Campbell. I have so far forborne making nominations to fill these\r\nvacancies for reasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoing judges\r\nresided within the States now overrun by revolt, so that if successors\r\nwere appointed in the same localities they could not now serve upon their\r\ncircuits; and many of the most competent men there probably would not take\r\nthe personal hazard of accepting to serve, even here, upon the Supreme\r\nbench. I have been unwilling to throw all the appointments north-ward,\r\nthus disabling myself from doing justice to the South on the return of\r\npeace; although I may remark that to transfer to the North one which has\r\nheretofore been in the South would not, with reference to territory and\r\npopulation, be unjust.\r\n\r\nDuring the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean his circuit\r\ngrew into an empire-altogether too large for any one judge to give the\r\ncourts therein more than a nominal attendance--rising in population from\r\n1,470,018 in 1830 to 6,151,405 in 1860.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the country generally has outgrown our present judicial\r\nsystem. If uniformity was at all intended, the system requires that all\r\nthe States shall be accommodated with circuit courts, attended by Supreme\r\njudges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida,\r\nTexas, California, and Oregon have never had any such courts. Nor can this\r\nwell be remedied without a change in the system, because the adding of\r\njudges to the Supreme Court, enough for the accommodation of all parts\r\nof the country with circuit courts, would create a court altogether too\r\nnumerous for a judicial body of any sort. And the evil, if it be one, will\r\nincrease as new States come into the Union. Circuit courts are useful or\r\nthey are not useful. If useful, no State should be denied them; if\r\nnot useful, no State should have them. Let them be provided for all or\r\nabolished as to all.\r\n\r\nThree modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be\r\nan improvement upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of\r\nconvenient number in every event; then, first, let the whole country be\r\ndivided into circuits of convenient size, the Supreme judges to serve in a\r\nnumber of them corresponding to their own number, and independent circuit\r\njudges be provided for all the rest; or, secondly, let the Supreme judges\r\nbe relieved from circuit duties and circuit judges provided for all the\r\ncircuits; or, thirdly, dispense with circuit courts altogether, leaving\r\nthe judicial functions wholly to the district courts and an independent\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n\r\nI respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the present\r\ncondition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able\r\nto find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which\r\nconstantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of\r\nthem. Since the Organization of the government, Congress has enacted some\r\n5000 acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than 6000 closely printed\r\npages and are scattered through many volumes. Many of these acts have been\r\ndrawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions\r\nare often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other, or\r\nat least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the\r\nbest-informed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law really\r\nis.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as\r\nplain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass\r\nas may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the\r\nLegislature and the perspicuity of its language. This well done would, I\r\nthink, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist\r\nin the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the\r\npeople, by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible form\r\nthe laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties.\r\n\r\nI am informed by some whose opinions I respect that all the acts of\r\nCongress now in force and of a permanent and general nature might be\r\nrevised and rewritten so as to be embraced in one volume (or at most two\r\nvolumes) of ordinary and convenient size; and I respectfully recommend to\r\nCongress to consider of the subject, and if my suggestion be approved\r\nto devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the\r\nattainment of the end proposed.\r\n\r\nOne of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is\r\nthe entire suppression in many places of all the ordinary means of\r\nadministering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of existing\r\nlaw. This is the case, in whole or in part, in all the insurgent States;\r\nand as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of those\r\nStates the practical evil becomes more apparent. There are no courts\r\nor officers to whom the citizens of other States may apply for the\r\nenforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent\r\nStates, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims.\r\nSome have estimated it as high as $200,000,000, due in large part from\r\ninsurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are even now making\r\ngreat sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I have been urgently solicited to establish, by\r\nmilitary power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I\r\nhave thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the end\r\nproposed--the collection of the debts--was just and right in itself, but\r\nbecause I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in\r\nthe unusual exercise of power. But the powers of Congress, I suppose, are\r\nequal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the whole matter to\r\nCongress, with the hope that a plan maybe devised for the administration\r\nof justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and Territories as\r\nmay be under the control of this government, whether by a voluntary return\r\nto allegiance and order or by the power of our arms; this, however, not\r\nto be a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute, and to cease as\r\nsoon as the ordinary courts can be reestablished in peace.\r\n\r\nIt is important that some more convenient means should be provided, if\r\npossible, for the adjustment of claims against the government, especially\r\nin view of their increased number by reason of the war. It is as much the\r\nduty of government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of\r\ncitizens as it is to administer the same between private individuals. The\r\ninvestigation and adjudication of claims in their nature belong to\r\nthe judicial department. Besides, it is apparent that the attention of\r\nCongress will be more than usually engaged for some time to come with\r\ngreat national questions. It was intended by the organization of the\r\nCourt of Claims mainly to remove this branch of business from the halls of\r\nCongress; but, while the court has proved to be an effective and valuable\r\nmeans of investigation, it in great degree fails to effect the object of\r\nits creation for want of power to make its judgments final.\r\n\r\nFully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger of the subject,\r\nI commend to your careful consideration whether this power of making\r\njudgments final may not properly be given to the court, reserving the\r\nright of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme Court, with such other\r\nprovisions as experience may have shown to be necessary.\r\n\r\nI ask attention to the report of the Postmaster general, the following\r\nbeing a summary statement of the condition of the department:\r\n\r\nThe revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1861, including the annual permanent appropriation of $700,000 for the\r\ntransportation of \"free mail matter,\" was $9,049,296.40, being about 2 per\r\ncent. less than the revenue for 1860.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures were $13,606,759.11, showing a decrease of more than\r\n8 per cent. as compared with those of the previous year and leaving\r\nan excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of\r\n$4,557,462.71.\r\n\r\nThe gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at\r\nan increase of 4 per cent. on that of 1861, making $8,683,000, to which\r\nshould be added the earnings of the department in carrying free matter,\r\nviz., $700,000, making $9,383,000.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leaving an\r\nestimated deficiency of $3,145,000 to be supplied from the treasury in\r\naddition to the permanent appropriation.\r\n\r\nThe present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this\r\nDistrict across the Potomac River at the time of establishing the capital\r\nhere was eminently wise, and consequently that the relinquishment of\r\nthat portion of it which lies within the State of Virginia was unwise and\r\ndangerous. I submit for your consideration the expediency of regaining\r\nthat part of the District and the restoration of the original boundaries\r\nthereof through negotiations with the State of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying\r\ndocuments, exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public\r\nbusiness pertaining to that department. The depressing influences of the\r\ninsurrection have been specially felt in the operations of the Patent and\r\nGeneral Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of public lands\r\nduring the past year have exceeded the expenses of our land system only\r\nabout $200,000. The sales have been entirely suspended in the Southern\r\nStates, while the interruptions to the business of the country and the\r\ndiversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service have\r\nobstructed settlements in the new States and Territories of the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about\r\n$100,000.00 rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to\r\nmake it self-sustaining.\r\n\r\nThe demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by\r\nthe insurrection. Numerous applications for pensions, based upon the\r\ncasualties of the existing war, have already been made. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of the\r\nbounty of the government are in the ranks of the insurgent army or\r\ngiving them aid and comfort. The Secretary of the Interior has directed\r\na suspension of the payment of the pensions of such persons upon proof\r\nof their disloyalty. I recommend that Congress authorize that officer to\r\ncause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the government with the Indian tribes have been greatly\r\ndisturbed by the insurrection, especially in the southern superintendency\r\nand in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of Kansas is in the\r\npossession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The agents of the United\r\nStates appointed since the 4th of March for this superintendency have been\r\nunable to reach their posts, while the most of those who were in office\r\nbefore that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause, and assume\r\nto exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the\r\ninsurrectionists. It has been stated in the public press that a portion of\r\nthose Indians have been organized as a military force and are attached\r\nto the army of the insurgents. Although the government has no official\r\ninformation upon this subject, letters have been written to the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs by several prominent chiefs giving\r\nassurance of their loyalty to the United States and expressing a wish for\r\nthe presence of Federal troops to protect them. It is believed that upon\r\nthe repossession of the country by the Federal forces the Indians will\r\nreadily cease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former relations\r\nto the government.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has not\r\na department nor a bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in\r\nthe government. While it is fortunate that this great interest is so\r\nindependent in its nature as not to have demanded and extorted more from\r\nthe government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something\r\nmore cannot be given voluntarily with general advantage.\r\n\r\nAnnual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures would present a fund of information of great practical value\r\nto the country. While I make no suggestion as to details, I venture the\r\nopinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade\r\nhas been confided to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of\r\ngratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of\r\nthis inhuman traffic have been recently attended with unusual success.\r\nFive vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and\r\ncondemned. Two mates of vessels engaged in the trade and one person in\r\nequipping a vessel as a slaver have been convicted and subjected to the\r\npenalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain, taken with a cargo of\r\nAfricans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of\r\noffense under our laws, the punishment of which is death.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, created by the last\r\nCongress, have been organized, and civil administration has been\r\ninaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when it is\r\nconsidered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these\r\nnew countries when the Federal officers arrived there.\r\n\r\nThe abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security and\r\nprotection afforded by organized government, will doubtless invite to them\r\na large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country\r\nto its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the Legislature\r\nof Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the\r\nTerritory. So far the authority of the United States has been upheld in\r\nall the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in the future. I commend\r\ntheir interests and defense to the enlightened and generous care of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests of\r\nthe District of Columbia. The insurrection has been the cause of\r\nmuch suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no\r\nrepresentative in Congress that body should not overlook their just claims\r\nupon the government.\r\n\r\nAt your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the\r\nPresident to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of\r\nthe industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the\r\nindustry of all nations to be holden at London in the year 1862. I regret\r\nto say I have been unable to give personal attention to this subject--a\r\nsubject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively and intimately\r\nconnected with the material prosperity of the world. Through the\r\nSecretaries of State and of the Interior a plan or system has been devised\r\nand partly matured, and which will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nUnder and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled \"An act to confiscate\r\nproperty used for insurrectionary purposes,\" approved August 6, 1861, the\r\nlegal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other\r\npersons have become forfeited, and numbers of the latter thus liberated\r\nare already dependent on the United States, and must be provided for in\r\nsome way. Besides this, it is not impossible that some of the States\r\nwill pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively, and by\r\noperation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for\r\ndisposal. In such case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting\r\nsuch persons from such States, according to some mode of valuation, in\r\nlieu, pro tanto, of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on\r\nwith such States respectively; that such persons, on such acceptance by\r\nthe General Government, be at once deemed free, and that in any event\r\nsteps be taken for colonizing both classes (or the one first mentioned if\r\nthe other shall not be brought into existence) at some place or places in\r\na climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too, whether\r\nthe free colored people already in the United States could not, so far as\r\nindividuals may desire, be included in such colonization.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of\r\nterritory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended\r\nin the territorial acquisition. Having practised the acquisition of\r\nterritory for nearly sixty years, the question of constitutional power to\r\ndo so is no longer an open one with us. The power was questioned at first\r\nby Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded\r\nhis scruples on the plea of great expediency. If it be said that the only\r\nlegitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white\r\nmen, this measure effects that object, for emigration of colored men\r\nleaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here. Mr.\r\nJefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring Louisiana more on\r\npolitical and commercial grounds than on providing room for population.\r\n\r\nOn this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money with\r\nthe acquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount to absolute\r\nnecessity--that without which the government itself cannot be perpetuated?\r\n\r\nThe war continues. In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing\r\nthe insurrection I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable\r\nconflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and\r\nremorseless revolutionary struggle. I have therefore in every case thought\r\nit proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary\r\nobject of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not\r\nof vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade\r\nof the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force by\r\nproclamation the law of Congress enacted at the late session for closing\r\nthose ports.\r\n\r\nSo also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligations\r\nof law, instead of transcending I have adhered to the act of Congress to\r\nconfiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon\r\nthe same subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered.\r\nThe Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be\r\nemployed. We should not be in haste to determine that radical and\r\nextreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration and the\r\nmessage to Congress at the late special session were both mainly\r\ndevoted to topics domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and\r\nconsequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract to or\r\nfrom the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in those\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nThe last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at the\r\nassault upon Fort Sumter, and a general review of what has occurred since\r\nmay not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain then is much better\r\ndefined and more distinct now, and the progress of events is plainly in\r\nthe right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a strong support\r\nfrom north of Mason and Dixon's line, and the friends of the Union were\r\nnot free from apprehension on the point. This, however, was soon settled\r\ndefinitely, and on the right side. South of the line noble little Delaware\r\nled off right from the first. Maryland was made to seem against the Union.\r\nOur soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned, and railroads torn up\r\nwithin her limits, and we were many days at one time without the ability\r\nto bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital. Now her bridges\r\nand railroads are repaired and open to the government; she already gives\r\nseven regiments to the cause of the Union, and none to the enemy; and\r\nher people, at a regular election, have sustained the Union by a larger\r\nmajority and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any\r\ncandidate or any question. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now\r\ndecidedly and, I think, unchangeably ranged on the side of the Union.\r\nMissouri is comparatively quiet, and, I believe, can, not again be overrun\r\nby the insurrectionists. These three States of Maryland, Kentucky, and\r\nMissouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have\r\nnow an aggregate of not less than forty thousand in the field for the\r\nUnion, while of their citizens certainly not more than a third of that\r\nnumber, and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful existence, are in\r\narms against us. After a somewhat bloody struggle of months, winter closes\r\non the Union people of western Virginia, leaving them masters of their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAn insurgent force of about fifteen hundred, for months dominating\r\nthe narrow peninsular region constituting the counties of Accomac and\r\nNorthampton, and known as Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with some\r\ncontiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people\r\nthere have renewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the\r\nold flag. This leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac or\r\neast of the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\nAlso we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the\r\nsouthern coast of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee Island (near Savannah),\r\nand Ship Island; and we likewise have some general accounts of popular\r\nmovements in behalf of the Union in North Carolina and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThese things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is advancing steadily\r\nand certainly southward.\r\n\r\nSince your last adjournment Lieutenant-General Scott has retired from the\r\nhead of the army. During his long life the nation has not been unmindful\r\nof his merit; yet on calling to mind how faithfully, ably, and brilliantly\r\nhe has served the country, from a time far back in our history, when few\r\nof the now living had been born, and thenceforward continually, I\r\ncannot but think we are still his debtors. I submit, therefore, for your\r\nconsideration what further mark of recognition is due to him, and to\r\nourselves as a grateful people.\r\n\r\nWith the retirement of General Scott came the Executive duty of\r\nappointing in his stead a general-in-chief of the army. It is a fortunate\r\ncircumstance that neither in council nor country was there, so far as I\r\nknow, any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be selected.\r\nThe retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor of General\r\nMcClellan for the position, and in this the nation seemed to give a\r\nunanimous concurrence. The designation of General McClellan is therefore\r\nin considerable degree the selection of the country as well as of the\r\nExecutive, and hence there is better reason to hope there will be given\r\nhim the confidence and cordial support thus by fair implication promised,\r\nand without which he cannot with so full efficiency serve the country.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones, and\r\nthe saying is true if taken to mean no more than that an army is better\r\ndirected by a single mind, though inferior, than by two superior ones at\r\nvariance and cross-purposes with each other.\r\n\r\nAnd the same is true in all joint operations wherein those engaged can\r\nhave none but a common end in view and can differ only as to the choice\r\nof means. In a storm at sea no one on hoard can wish the ship to sink, and\r\nyet not unfrequently all go down together because too many will direct and\r\nno single mind can be allowed to control.\r\n\r\nIt continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not\r\nexclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government--the\r\nrights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most\r\ngrave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the general\r\ntone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the abridgment of the\r\nexisting right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to\r\nparticipate in the selection of public officers except the legislative\r\nboldly advocated, with labored arguments to prove that large control of\r\nthe people in government is the source of all political evil. Monarchy\r\nitself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit\r\nraising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism. It\r\nis not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made\r\nin favor of popular institutions, but there is one point, with its\r\nconnections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief\r\nattention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with, if\r\nnot above, labor in the structure of government. It is assumed that labor\r\nis available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless\r\nsomebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to\r\nlabor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital\r\nshall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent, or\r\nbuy them and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so\r\nfar, it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers\r\nor what we call slaves. And further, it is assumed that whoever is once a\r\nhired laborer is fixed in that condition for life.\r\n\r\nNow there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is\r\nthere any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition\r\nof a hired laborer. Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences\r\nfrom them are groundless.\r\n\r\nLabor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of\r\nlabor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor\r\nis the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.\r\nCapital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other\r\nrights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a\r\nrelation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. The error is\r\nin assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation.\r\nA few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their\r\ncapital hire or buy another few to labor for them. A large majority belong\r\nto neither class--neither work for others nor have others working for\r\nthem. In most of the Southern States a majority of the whole people of\r\nall colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large\r\nmajority are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their families--wives,\r\nsons, and daughters,--work for themselves on their farms, in their houses,\r\nand in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no\r\nfavors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the\r\nother. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle\r\ntheir own labor with capital; that is, they labor with their own hands and\r\nalso buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed and\r\nnot a distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of\r\nthis mixed class.\r\n\r\nAgain, as has already been said, there is not of necessity any such thing\r\nas the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life. Many\r\nindependent men everywhere in these States a few years back in their lives\r\nwere hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors\r\nfor wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for\r\nhimself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length\r\nhires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous\r\nand prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and\r\nconsequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all. No men\r\nliving are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty;\r\nnone less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly\r\nearned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power which they\r\nalready possess, and which if surrendered will surely be used to close the\r\ndoor of advancement against such as they and to fix new disabilities and\r\nburdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost.\r\n\r\nFrom the first taking of our national census to the last are seventy\r\nyears, and we find our population at the end of the period eight times as\r\ngreat as it was at the beginning. The increase of those other things which\r\nmen deem desirable has been even greater. We thus have at one view what\r\nthe popular principle, applied to government through the machinery of\r\nthe States and the Union, has produced in a given time, and also what if\r\nfirmly maintained it promises for the future. There are already among\r\nus those who if the Union be preserved will live to see it contain\r\n200,000,000. The struggle of to-day is not altogether for to-day; it is\r\nfor a vast future also. With a reliance on Providence all the more firm\r\nand earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events have devolved\r\nupon us.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I am, as you\r\nintimate, losing much of the great confidence I placed in you, not from\r\nany act or omission of yours touching the public service, up to the time\r\nyou were sent to Leavenworth, but from the flood of grumbling despatches\r\nand letters I have seen from you since. I knew you were being ordered\r\nto Leavenworth at the time it was done; and I aver that with as tender a\r\nregard for your honor and your sensibilities as I had for my own, it never\r\noccurred to me that you were being \"humiliated, insulted, and disgraced\";\r\nnor have I, up to this day, heard an intimation that you have been\r\nwronged, coming from any one but yourself. No one has blamed you for the\r\nretrograde movement from Springfield, nor for the information you gave\r\nGeneral Cameron; and this you could readily understand, if it were not\r\nfor your unwarranted assumption that the ordering you to Leavenworth must\r\nnecessarily have been done as a punishment for some fault. I thought then,\r\nand think yet, the position assigned to you is as responsible, and as\r\nhonorable, as that assigned to Buell--I know that General McClellan\r\nexpected more important results from it. My impression is that at the\r\ntime you were assigned to the new Western Department, it had not been\r\ndetermined to replace General Sherman in Kentucky; but of this I am not\r\ncertain, because the idea that a command in Kentucky was very desirable,\r\nand one in the farther West undesirable, had never occurred to me. You\r\nconstantly speak of being placed in command of only 3000. Now, tell me, is\r\nthis not mere impatience? Have you not known all the while that you are to\r\ncommand four or five times that many.\r\n\r\nI have been, and am sincerely your friend; and if, as such, I dare to make\r\na suggestion, I would say you are adopting the best possible way to ruin\r\nyourself. \"Act well your part, there all the honor lies.\" He who does\r\nsomething at the head of one regiment, will eclipse him who does nothing\r\nat the head of a hundred.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Are General Buell and yourself in concert? When\r\nhe moves on Bowling Green, what hinders it being reinforced from Columbus?\r\nA simultaneous movement by you on Columbus might prevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

BUELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, January 1, 1862\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL BUELL, Louisville:\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan should not yet be disturbed with business. I think you\r\nbetter get in concert with General Halleck at once. I write you to-night.\r\nI also telegraph and write Halleck.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, January 1, 1862\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan is not dangerously ill, as I hope, but would better not\r\nbe disturbed with business. I am very anxious that, in case of General\r\nBuell's moving toward Nashville, the enemy shall not be greatly\r\nreinforced, and I think there is danger he will be from Columbus. It seems\r\nto me that a real or feigned attack upon Columbus from up the river at\r\nthe same time would either prevent this or compensate for it by throwing\r\nColumbus into our hands. I wrote General Buell a letter similar to this,\r\nmeaning that he and you shall communicate and act in concert, unless it be\r\nyour judgment and his that there is no necessity for it. You and he will\r\nunderstand much better than I how to do it. Please do not lose time in\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PEOPLE OF MARYLAND,\r\n\r\nIn view of the recent declaration of the people of Maryland of their\r\nadhesion to the Union, so distinctly made in their recent election,\r\nthe President directs that all the prisoners who having heretofore\r\nbeen arrested in that State are now detained in military custody by\r\nthe President's authority, be released from their imprisonment on the\r\nfollowing conditions, namely: that if they were holding any civil or\r\nmilitary offices when arrested, the terms of which have expired, they\r\nshall not resume or reclaim such office; and secondly, all persons\r\navailing themselves of this proclamation shall engage by oath or parole of\r\nhonor to maintain the Union and the Constitution of the United States, and\r\nin no way to aid or abet by arms, counsel, conversation, or information\r\nof any kind the existing insurrection against the Government of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTo guard against misapprehension it is proper to state that this\r\nproclamation does not apply to prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 2, 1862\r\n\r\nTo THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a letter to the Secretary of State\r\nfrom James R. Partridge, secretary to the executive committee to the in\r\nexhibition to be held in London in the course present year, and a copy\r\nof the correspond which it refers, relative to a vessel for the of taking\r\nsuch articles as persons in this country may wish to exhibit on that\r\noccasion. As it appears no naval vessel can be spared for the purpose, I\r\nrecommend that authority be given to charter a suitable merchant vessel,\r\nin order that facilities similar to those afforded by the government\r\nexhibition of 1851 may also be extended to citizens of the United States\r\nwho may desire to contribute to the exhibition of this year.\r\n\r\nA.

BUELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BUELL:\r\n\r\nHave arms gone forward for East Tennessee? Please tell me the progress and\r\ncondition of the movement in that direction. Answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL D. C. BUELL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJanuary 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL BUELL.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your despatch of yesterday has been received, and it\r\ndisappoints and distresses me. I have shown it to General McClellan, who\r\nsays he will write you to-day. I am not competent to criticize your views,\r\nand therefore what I offer is in justification of myself. Of the two, I\r\nwould rather have a point on the railroad south of Cumberland Gap\r\nthan Nashville. First, because it cuts a great artery of the enemy's\r\ncommunication, which Nashville does not; and secondly, because it is in\r\nthe midst of loyal people who would rally around it, while Nashville is\r\nnot. Again, I cannot see why the movement on East Tennessee would not be\r\na diversion in your favor rather than a disadvantage, assuming that a\r\nmovement toward Nashville is the main object. But my distress is that our\r\nfriends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair, and even\r\nnow, I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal\r\nprotection. In this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the South.\r\nMy despatch, to which yours is an answer, was sent with the knowledge of\r\nSenator Johnson and Representative Maynard of East Tennessee, and they\r\nwill be upon me to know the answer, which I cannot safely show them. They\r\nwould despair, possibly resign to go and save their families somehow,\r\nor die with them. I do not intend this to be an order in any sense, but\r\nmerely, as intimated before, to show you the grounds of my anxiety.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 7, 1862.\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL D.C. BUELL, Louisville:\r\n\r\nPlease name as early a day as you safely can on or before which you can\r\nbe ready to move southward in concert with Major-General Halleck. Delay is\r\nruining us, and it is indispensable for me to have something definite. I\r\nsend a like despatch to Major-General Halleck.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 10, 1862\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a translation of an instruction to the minister of\r\nhis Majesty the Emperor of Austria accredited to this government, and a\r\ncopy of a note to that minister from the Secretary of State relative to\r\nthe questions involved in the taking from the British steamer Trent of\r\ncertain citizens of the United States by order of Captain Wilkes of the\r\nUnited States Navy. This correspondence may be considered as a sequel to\r\nthat previously communicated to Congress relating to the same subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT ON LETTER FROM GENERAL HALLECK,\r\n\r\nJANUARY 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI ST. Louis, January 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nTo His EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nIn reply to your Excellency's letter of the 1st instant, I have to state\r\nthat on receiving your telegram I immediately communicated with General\r\nBuell and have since sent him all the information I could obtain of the\r\nenemy's movements about Columbus and Camp Beauregard. No considerable\r\nforce has been sent from those places to Bowling Green. They have about\r\n22,000 men at Columbus, and the place is strongly fortified. I have at\r\nCairo, Port Holt, and Paducah only about 15,000, which, after leaving\r\nguards at these places, would give me but little over 10,000 men with\r\nwhich to assist General Buell. It would be madness to attempt anything\r\nserious with such a force, and I cannot at the present time withdraw any\r\nfrom Missouri without risking the loss of this State. The troops recently\r\nraised in other States of this department have, without my knowledge, been\r\nsent to Kentucky and Kansas.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that the authorities at Washington do not appreciate the\r\ndifficulties with which we have to contend here. The operations of Lane,\r\nJennison, and others have so enraged the people of Missouri that it is\r\nestimated that there is a majority of 80,000 against the government. We\r\nare virtually in an enemy's country. Price and others have a considerable\r\narmy in the southwest, against which I am operating with all my available\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThis city and most of the middle and northern counties are\r\ninsurrectionary,--burning bridges, destroying telegraph lines, etc.,--and\r\ncan be kept down only by the presence of troops. A large portion of the\r\nforeign troops organized by General Fremont are unreliable; indeed, many\r\nof them are already mutinous. They have been tampered with by politicians,\r\nand made to believe that if they get up a mutiny and demand Fremont's\r\nreturn the government will be forced to restore him to duty here. It\r\nis believed that some high officers are in the plot I have already been\r\nobliged to disarm several of these organizations, and I am daily expecting\r\nmore serious outbreaks. Another grave difficulty is the want of proper\r\ngeneral officers to command the troops and enforce order and discipline,\r\nand especially to protect public property from robbery and plunder.\r\nSome of the brigadier-generals assigned to this department are entirely\r\nignorant of their duties and unfit for any command. I assure you, Mr.\r\nPresident, it is very difficult to accomplish much with such means. I am\r\nin the condition of a carpenter who is required to build a bridge with\r\na dull axe, a broken saw, and rotten timber. It is true that I have some\r\nvery good green timber, which will answer the purpose as soon as I can get\r\nit into shape and season it a little.\r\n\r\nI know nothing of General Buell's intended operations, never having\r\nreceived any information in regard to the general plan of campaign. If\r\nit be intended that his column shall move on Bowling Green while another\r\nmoves from Cairo or Paducah on Columbus or Camp Beauregard, it will be a\r\nrepetition of the same strategic error which produced the disaster of Bull\r\nRun. To operate on exterior lines against an enemy occupying a central\r\nposition will fail, as it always has failed, in ninety-nine cases out of a\r\nhundred. It is condemned by every military authority I have ever read.\r\n\r\nGeneral Buell's army and the forces at Paducah occupy precisely the same\r\nposition in relation to each other and to the enemy as did the armies of\r\nMcDowell and Patterson before the battle of Bull Run.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General\r\n\r\n[Indorsement]\r\n\r\nThe within is a copy of a letter just received from General Halleck. It is\r\nexceedingly discouraging. As everywhere else, nothing can be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR ANDREW.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., January 11, 1862\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR JOHN A. ANDREW, Boston:\r\n\r\nI will be greatly obliged if you will arrange; somehow with General Butler\r\nto officer his two un-officered regiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL D. C. BUELL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 13, 1861\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL BUELL.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--Your despatch of yesterday is received, in which you say, \"I\r\nreceived your letter and General McClellan's, and will at once devote my\r\nefforts to your views and his.\" In the midst of my many cares I have not\r\nseen, nor asked to see, General McClellan's letter to you. For my own\r\nviews, I have not offered and do not now offer them as orders; and while I\r\nam glad to have them respectfully considered, I would blame you to follow\r\nthem contrary to your own clear judgment, unless I should put them in the\r\nform of orders. As to General McClellan's views, you understand your duty\r\nin regard to them better than I do.\r\n\r\nWith this preliminary I state my general idea of this war to be, that\r\nwe have the greater numbers and the enemy has the greater facility of\r\nconcentrating forces upon points of collision; that we must fail unless we\r\ncan find some way of making our advantage an overmatch for his; and that\r\nthis can only be done by menacing him with superior forces at different\r\npoints at the same time, so that we can safely attack one or both if he\r\nmakes no change; and if he weakens one to strengthen the other, forbear to\r\nattack the strengthened one, but seize and hold the weakened one, gaining\r\nso much.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: Suppose last summer, when Winchester ran away to reinforce\r\nManassas, we had forborne to attack Manassas, but had seized and held\r\nWinchester. I mention this to illustrate and not to criticise. I did not\r\nlose confidence in McDowell, and I think less harshly of Patterson than\r\nsome others seem to.... Applying the principle to your case, my idea is\r\nthat Halleck shall menace Columbus and \"down river\" generally, while you\r\nmenace Bowling Green and East Tennessee. If the enemy shall concentrate\r\nat Bowling Green, do not retire from his front, yet do not fight him there\r\neither, but seize Columbus and East Tennessee, one or both, left exposed\r\nby the concentration at Bowling Green. It is a matter of no small anxiety\r\nto me, and which I am sure you will not overlook, that the East Tennessee\r\nline is so long and over so bad a road.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n(Indorsement.)\r\n\r\nHaving to-day written General Buell a letter, it occurs to me to send\r\nGeneral Halleck a copy of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The Germans are true and patriotic and so far as they have\r\ngot cross in Missouri it is upon mistake and misunderstanding. Without a\r\nknowledge of its contents, Governor Koerner, of Illinois, will hand you\r\nthis letter. He is an educated and talented German gentleman, as true a\r\nman as lives. With his assistance you can set everything right with\r\nthe Germans.... My clear judgment is that, with reference to the German\r\nelement in your command, you should have Governor Koerner with you; and if\r\nagreeable to you and him, I will make him a brigadier-general, so that\r\nhe can afford to give his time. He does not wish to command in the field,\r\nthough he has more military knowledge than some who do. If he goes\r\ninto the place, he will simply be an efficient, zealous, and unselfish\r\nassistant to you. I say all this upon intimate personal acquaintance with\r\nGovernor Koerner.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 17, 1862\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a translation of an instruction to the minister of\r\nhis Majesty the King of Prussia accredited to this government, and a copy\r\nof a note to that minister from the Secretary of State relating to the\r\ncapture and detention of certain citizens of the United States, passengers\r\non board the British steamer Trent, by order of Captain Wilkes of the\r\nUnited States Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

McCLELLAN,\r\n\r\nCommanding Armies of the United States:\r\n\r\nYou or any officer you may designate will in your discretion suspend the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus so far as may relate to Major Chase, lately of the\r\nEngineer Corps of the Army of the United States, now alleged to be guilty\r\nof treasonable practices against this government.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, January 31, 1862\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--It is my wish that the expedition commonly called the\r\n\"Lane Expedition\" shall be, as much as has been promised at the\r\nadjutant-general's office, under the supervision of General McClellan, and\r\nnot any more. I have not intended, and do not now intend, that it shall be\r\na great, exhausting affair, but a snug, sober column of 10,000 or 15,000.\r\nGeneral Lane has been told by me many times that he is under the command\r\nof General Hunter, and assented to it as often as told. It was the\r\ndistinct agreement between him and me, when I appointed him, that he was\r\nto be under Hunter.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT'S SPECIAL WAR ORDER NO. 1.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 31, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That all the disposable force of the Army of the Potomac,\r\nafter providing safely for the defence of Washington, be formed into an\r\nexpedition for the immediate object of seizing and occupying a point upon\r\nthe railroad southwestward of what is known as Manassas Junction, all\r\ndetails to be in the discretion of the commander-in-chief, and the\r\nexpedition to move before or on the 22d day of February next.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPOSITION TO McCLELLAN'S PLANS\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--You and I have distinct and different plans for a movement\r\nof the Army of the Potomac--yours to be down the Chesapeake, up the\r\nRappahannock to Urbana, and across land to the terminus of the railroad on\r\nthe York River; mine to move directly to a point on the railroad southwest\r\nof Manassas.\r\n\r\nIf you will give me satisfactory answers to the following questions, I\r\nshall gladly yield my plan to yours.\r\n\r\nFirst. Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time and\r\nmoney than mine?\r\n\r\nSecond. Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine?\r\n\r\nThird. Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine?\r\n\r\nFourth. In fact, would it not be less valuable in this, that it would\r\nbreak no great line of the enemy's communications, while mine would?\r\n\r\nFifth. In case of disaster, would not a retreat be more difficult by your\r\nplan than mine?\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemorandum accompanying Letter of President Lincoln to General McClellan,\r\n\r\ndated February 3,1862.\r\n\r\nFirst. Suppose the enemy should attack us in force before we reach the\r\nOccoquan, what?\r\n\r\nSecond. Suppose the enemy in force shall dispute the crossing of the\r\nOccoquan, what? In view of this, might it not be safest for us to cross\r\nthe Occoquan at Coichester, rather than at the village of Occoquan? This\r\nwould cost the enemy two miles of travel to meet us, but would, on the\r\ncontrary, leave us two miles farther from our ultimate destination.\r\n\r\nThird. Suppose we reach Maple Valley without an attack, will we not be\r\nattacked there in force by the enemy marching by the several roads from\r\nManassas; and if so, what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WM. H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Yours of January 30th just received. Do just as you say\r\nabout the money matter.\r\n\r\nAs you well know, I have not time to write a letter of respectable length.\r\nGod bless you, says\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPITE FOR NATHANIEL GORDON\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\r\nTo all to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting:\r\n\r\nWhereas it appears that at a term of the Circuit Court of the United\r\nStates of America for the Southern District of New York held in the month\r\nof November, A.D. 1861, Nathaniel Gordon was indicted and convicted for\r\nbeing engaged in the slave trade, and was by the said court sentenced to\r\nbe put to death by hanging by the neck, on Friday the 7th day of February,\r\nAD. 1862:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas a large number of respectable citizens have earnestly besought\r\nme to commute the said sentence of the said Nathaniel Gordon to a term of\r\nimprisonment for life, which application I have felt it to be my duty to\r\nrefuse:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas it has seemed to me probable that the unsuccessful application\r\nmade for the commutation of his sentence may have prevented the said\r\nNathaniel Gordon from making the necessary preparation for the awful\r\nchange which awaits him;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known, that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States of America, have granted and do hereby grant unto him, the\r\nsaid Nathaniel Gordon, a respite of the above recited sentence, until\r\nFriday the twenty-first day of February, A.D. 1862, between the hours of\r\ntwelve o'clock at noon and three o'clock in the afternoon of the said day,\r\nwhen the said sentence shall be executed.\r\n\r\nIn granting this respite, it becomes my painful duty to admonish the\r\nprisoner that, relinquishing all expectation of pardon by human authority,\r\nhe refer himself alone to the mercy of the common God and Father of all\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto signed my name and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the City of Washington, this fourth day of February, A.D. 1862,\r\nand of the independence of the United States the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, February 4. 1862\r\n\r\nTo THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved December 21, 1862, provides:\r\n\r\n\"That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the retired\r\nlist of the navy for the command of squadrons and single ships such\r\nofficers as he may believe that the good of the service requires to be\r\nthus placed in command; and such officers may, if upon the recommendation\r\nof the President of the United States they shall receive a vote of thanks\r\nof Congress for their services and gallantry in action against an enemy,\r\nbe restored to the active list, and not otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, Captain Samuel F. Du Pont, of the navy, was\r\nnominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command of\r\nthe squadron which recently rendered such important service to the Union\r\nin the expedition to the coast of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law, or be more pregnant with happy influence as\r\nan example, I cordially recommend that Captain Samuel F. Du Pont receive a\r\nvote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry displayed in the\r\ncapture of Forts Walker and Beauregard, commanding the entrance of Port\r\nRoyal Harbor, on the 7th of November, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERALS D. HUNTER AND J. H. LANE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, FEBRUARY 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER AND BRIGADIER-GENERAL LANE, Leavenworth, Kansas:\r\n\r\nMy wish has been and is to avail the government of the services of both\r\nGeneral Hunter and General Lane, and, so far as possible, to personally\r\noblige both. General Hunter is the senior officer, and must command when\r\nthey serve together; though in so far as he can consistently with the\r\npublic service and his own honor oblige General Lane, he will also oblige\r\nme. If they cannot come to an amicable understanding, General Lane must\r\nreport to General Hunter for duty, according to the rules, or decline the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 1, RELATING TO POLITICAL PRISONERS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, February 14,1862.\r\n\r\nThe breaking out of a formidable insurrection based on a conflict of\r\npolitical ideas, being an event without precedent in the United States,\r\nwas necessarily attended by great confusion and perplexity of the public\r\nmind. Disloyalty before unsuspected suddenly became bold, and treason\r\nastonished the world by bringing at once into the field military forces\r\nsuperior in number to the standing army of the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery department of the government was paralyzed by treason. Defection\r\nappeared in the Senate, in the House of Representatives, in the Cabinet,\r\nin the Federal courts; ministers and consuls returned from foreign\r\ncountries to enter the insurrectionary councils of land or naval forces;\r\ncommanding and other officers of the army and in the navy betrayed our\r\ncouncils or deserted their posts for commands in the insurgent forces.\r\nTreason was flagrant in the revenue and in the post-office service, as\r\nwell as in the Territorial governments and in the Indian reserves.\r\n\r\nNot only governors, judges, legislators, and ministerial officers in\r\nthe States, but even whole States rushed one after another with apparent\r\nunanimity into rebellion. The capital was besieged and its connection with\r\nall the States cut off. Even in the portions of the country which were\r\nmost loyal, political combinations and secret societies were formed\r\nfurthering the work of disunion, while, from motives of disloyalty or\r\ncupidity or from excited passions or perverted sympathies, individuals\r\nwere found furnishing men, money, and materials of war and supplies to the\r\ninsurgents' military and naval forces. Armies, ships, fortifications,\r\nnavy yards, arsenals, military posts, and garrisons one after another were\r\nbetrayed or abandoned to the insurgents.\r\n\r\nCongress had not anticipated, and so had not provided for, the emergency.\r\nThe municipal authorities were powerless and inactive. The judicial\r\nmachinery seemed as if it had been designed, not to sustain the\r\ngovernment, but to embarrass and betray it.\r\n\r\nForeign intervention, openly invited and industriously instigated by the\r\nabettors of the insurrection, became imminent, and has only been prevented\r\nby the practice of strict and impartial justice, with the most perfect\r\nmoderation, in our intercourse with nations.\r\n\r\nThe public mind was alarmed and apprehensive, though fortunately not\r\ndistracted or disheartened. It seemed to be doubtful whether the Federal\r\nGovernment, which one year before had been thought a model worthy of\r\nuniversal acceptance, had indeed the ability to defend and maintain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nSome reverses, which, perhaps, were unavoidable, suffered by newly levied\r\nand inefficient forces, discouraged the loyal and gave new hopes to the\r\ninsurgents. Voluntary enlistments seemed about to cease and desertions\r\ncommenced. Parties speculated upon the question whether conscription had\r\nnot become necessary to fill up the armies of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency the President felt it his duty to employ with energy the\r\nextraordinary powers which the Constitution confides to him in cases of\r\ninsurrection. He called into the field such military and naval forces,\r\nunauthorized by the existing laws, as seemed necessary. He directed\r\nmeasures to prevent the use of the post-office for treasonable\r\ncorrespondence. He subjected passengers to and from foreign countries to\r\nnew passport regulations, and he instituted a blockade, suspended the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus in various places, and caused persons who were\r\nrepresented to him as being or about to engage in disloyal and treasonable\r\npractices to be arrested by special civil as well as military agencies\r\nand detained in military custody when necessary to prevent them and deter\r\nothers from such practices. Examinations of such cases were instituted,\r\nand some of the persons so arrested have been discharged from time to time\r\nunder circumstances or upon conditions compatible, as was thought, with\r\nthe public safety.\r\n\r\nMeantime a favorable change of public opinion has occurred. The line\r\nbetween loyalty and disloyalty is plainly defined. The whole structure\r\nof the government is firm and stable. Apprehension of public danger and\r\nfacilities for treasonable practices have diminished with the passions\r\nwhich prompted heedless persons to adopt them. The insurrection is\r\nbelieved to have culminated and to be declining.\r\n\r\nThe President, in view of these facts, and anxious to favor a return to\r\nthe normal course of the administration as far as regard for the public\r\nwelfare will allow, directs that all political prisoners or state\r\nprisoners now held in military custody be released on their subscribing\r\nto a parole engaging them to render no aid or comfort to the enemies in\r\nhostility to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War will, however, in his discretion, except from the\r\neffect of this order any persons detained as spies in the service of the\r\ninsurgents, or others whose release at the present moment may be deemed\r\nincompatible with the public safety.\r\n\r\nTo all persons who shall be so released, and who shall keep their parole,\r\nthe President grants an amnesty for any past offences of treason or\r\ndisloyalty which they may have comminuted.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary arrests will hereafter be made under the direction of the\r\nmilitary authorities alone.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. WASHINGTON CITY, February 15, 1862\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved December 21, 1861, provides\r\n\r\n\"That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the retired\r\nlist of the navy for the command of squadrons and single ships such\r\nofficers as he may believe that the good of the service requires to be\r\nthus placed in command; and such officers may, if upon the recommendation\r\nof the President of the United States they shall receive a vote of thanks\r\nof Congress for their services and gallantry in action against an enemy,\r\nbe restored to the active list, and not otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, Captain Louis M. Goldsborough, of the navy,\r\nwas nominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command\r\nof the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, which recently rendered such\r\nimportant service to the Union in the expedition to the coast of North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence\r\nas an example, I cordially recommend that Captain Louis M. Goldsborough\r\nreceive a vote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry\r\ndisplayed in the combined attack of the forces commanded by him and\r\nBrigadier-General Burnside in the capture of Roanoke Island and the\r\ndestruction of rebel gunboats On the 7th, 8th, and 10th of February, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST WRITTEN NOTICE OF GRANT\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nFebruary 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nYou have Fort Donelson safe, unless Grant shall be overwhelmed from\r\noutside; to prevent which latter will, I think, require all the vigilance,\r\nenergy, and skill of yourself and Buell, acting in full co-operation.\r\nColumbus will not get at Grant, but the force from Bowling Green will.\r\nThey hold the railroad from Bowling Green to within a few miles of Fort\r\nDonelson, with the bridge at Clarksville undisturbed. It is unsafe to\r\nrely that they will not dare to expose Nashville to Buell. A small part of\r\ntheir force can retire slowly toward Nashville, breaking up the railroad\r\nas they go, and keep Buell out of that city twenty days. Meanwhile\r\nNashville will be abundantly defended by forces from all South and perhaps\r\nfrom hers at Manassas. Could not a cavalry force from General Thomas on\r\nthe upper Cumberland dash across, almost unresisted, and cut the railroad\r\nat or near Knoxville, Tennessee? In the midst of a bombardment at Fort\r\nDonelson, why could not a gunboat run up and destroy the bridge at\r\nClarksville? Our success or failure at Fort Donelson is vastly important,\r\nand I beg you to put your soul in the effort. I send a copy of this to\r\nBuell.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 2.--IN RELATION TO STATE PRISONERS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, FEBRUARY 27, 1862\r\n\r\nIt is ordered:\r\n\r\nFirst. That a special commission of two persons, one of military rank and\r\nthe other in civil life, be appointed to examine the cases of the state\r\nprisoners remaining in the military custody of the United States, and to\r\ndetermine whether in view of the public Safety and the existing rebellion\r\nthey should be discharged, or remain in military custody, or be remitted\r\nto the civil tribunals for trial.\r\n\r\nSecond. That Major-General John A. Dix, commanding in Baltimore, and the\r\nHON. Edwards Pierrepont, of New York, be, and they are hereby, appointed\r\ncommissioners for the purpose above mentioned; and they are authorized to\r\nexamine, hear, and determine the cases aforesaid ex parte and in a summary\r\nmanner, at such times and places as in their discretion they may appoint,\r\nand make full report to the War Department.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER RELATING TO COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the existing circumstances of the country allow a partial\r\nrestoration of commercial intercourse between the inhabitants of those\r\nparts of the United States heretofore declared to be in insurrection\r\nand the citizens of the loyal States of the Union, and exercising the\r\nauthority and discretion confided to me by the act of Congress, approved\r\nJuly 13, 1861, entitled \"An act further to provide for the collection of\r\nduties on imports, and for other purposes,\" I hereby license and permit\r\nsuch commercial intercourse in all cases within the rules and regulations\r\nwhich have been or may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for\r\nconducting and carrying on the same on the inland waters and ways of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 28, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH TO THE PERUVIAN MINISTER,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., MARCH 4, 1862\r\n\r\nThe United States have no enmities, animosities, or rivalries, and no\r\ninterests which conflict with the welfare, safety, and rights or interests\r\nof any other nation. Their own prosperity, happiness, and aggrandizement\r\nare sought most safely and advantageously through the preservation not\r\nonly of peace on their own part, but peace among all other nations. But\r\nwhile the United States are thus a friend to all other nations, they do\r\nnot seek to conceal the fact that they cherish especial sentiments of\r\nfriendship for, and sympathies with, those who, like themselves, have\r\nfounded their institutions on the principle of the equal rights of men;\r\nand such nations being more prominently neighbors of the United States,\r\nthe latter are co-operating with them in establishing civilization and\r\nculture on the American continent. Such being the general principles which\r\ngovern the United States in their foreign relations, you may be assured,\r\nsir, that in all things this government will deal justly, frankly, and, if\r\nit be possible, even liberally with Peru, whose liberal sentiments toward\r\nus you have so kindly expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS RECOMMENDING COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\nMarch 6, 1862\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:--I recommend\r\nthe adoption of a joint resolution by your honorable bodies which shall be\r\nsubstantially as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State which\r\nmay adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary\r\naid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to compensate for the\r\ninconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of system.\"\r\n\r\nIf the proposition contained in the resolution does not meet the approval\r\nof Congress and the country, there is the end; but if it does command such\r\napproval, I deem it of importance that the States and people immediately\r\ninterested should be at once distinctly notified of the fact, so that\r\nthey may begin to consider whether to accept or reject it. The Federal\r\nGovernment would find its highest interest in such a measure, as one of\r\nthe most efficient means of self-preservation. The leaders of the existing\r\ninsurrection entertain the hope that this government will ultimately be\r\nforced to acknowledge the independence of some part of the disaffected\r\nregion, and that all the slave States north of such part will then say,\r\n\"The Union for which we have struggled being already gone, we now\r\nchoose to go with the Southern section.\" To deprive them of this hope\r\nsubstantially ends the rebellion, and the initiation of emancipation\r\ncompletely deprives them of it as to all the States initiating it. The\r\npoint is not that all the States tolerating slavery would very soon, if at\r\nall, initiate emancipation; but that, while the offer is equally made to\r\nall, the more northern shall by such initiation make it certain to the\r\nmore southern that in no event will the former ever join the latter in\r\ntheir proposed confederacy. I say \"initiation\" because, in my judgment,\r\ngradual and not sudden emancipation is better for all. In the mere\r\nfinancial or pecuniary view, any member of Congress with the census tables\r\nand treasury reports before him can readily see for himself how very soon\r\nthe current expenditures of this war would purchase, at fair valuation,\r\nall the slaves in any named State. Such a proposition on the part of the\r\nGeneral Government sets up no claim of a right by Federal authority to\r\ninterfere with slavery within State limits, referring, as it does, the\r\nabsolute control of the subject in each case to the State and its people\r\nimmediately interested. It is proposed as a matter of perfectly free\r\nchoice with them.\r\n\r\nIn the annual message last December, I thought fit to say, \"The Union must\r\nbe preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed.\" I said\r\nthis not hastily, but deliberately. War has been made and continues to be\r\nan indispensable means to this end. A practical reacknowledgment of the\r\nnational authority would render the war unnecessary, and it would at once\r\ncease. If, however, resistance continues, the war must also continue; and\r\nit is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend and all the\r\nruin which may follow it. Such as may seem indispensable or may obviously\r\npromise great efficiency toward ending the struggle must and will come.\r\n\r\nThe proposition now made (though an offer only), I hope it may be esteemed\r\nno offense to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered would not\r\nbe of more value to the States and private persons concerned than are the\r\ninstitution and property in it in the present aspect of affairs.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would\r\nbe merely initiatory, and not within itself a practical measure, it is\r\nrecommended in the hope that it would soon lead to important practical\r\nresults. In full view of my great responsibility to my God and to my\r\ncountry, I earnestly beg the attention of Congress and the people to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

STANTON, SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The government at my special request a few months since contracted\r\nfor fourteen batteries of the James rifled gun, 6-pounder calibre, and a\r\nlimited quantity of the James projectiles, weighing about fourteen pounds\r\neach. The reports showing the superiority of this gun and projectile, both\r\nas regards range, accuracy, and execution, for field service over that of\r\nall others at the battle of Fort Donelson, leads me to request that there\r\nbe furnished to the State of Illinois in the shortest time practicable\r\nseven batteries of 12-pounder calibre James rifled guns, with carriages,\r\nharness, implements, etc., complete and ready for field service, together\r\nwith the following fixed ammunition to each gun, viz., 225 shells, 225\r\ncanister, and 50 solid projectiles, weighing about 24 pounds each, and\r\nalso 200 shells, 100 canister, and 100 solid projectiles for each of the\r\nguns of the fourteen batteries named above, weighing about 14 pounds each,\r\nall to be of the James model.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nRICHARD YATES, Governor of Illinois.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nMarch 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe within is from the Governor of Illinois. I understand the seven\r\nadditional batteries now sought are to be 6-gun batteries, and the object\r\nis to mix them with the fourteen batteries they already have so as to make\r\neach battery consist of four 6-pounders and two 12-pounders. I shall be\r\nvery glad to have the requisition filled if it can be without detriment to\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT'S GENERAL WAR ORDER NO.2.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nMarch 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered: 1. That the major-general commanding the Army of the Potomac\r\nproceed forthwith to organize that part of the said army destined to enter\r\nupon active operations (including the reserve, but excluding the troops to\r\nbe left in the fortifications about Washington) into four army corps, to\r\nbe commanded according to seniority of rank, as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst Corps to consist of four divisions, and to be commanded by\r\nMajor-General I. McDowell. Second Corps to consist of three divisions, and\r\nto be commanded by Brigadier-General E. V. Sumner. Third Corps to consist\r\nof three divisions, and to be commanded by Brigadier-General S. P.\r\nHeintzelman. Fourth Corps to consist of three divisions, and to be\r\ncommanded by Brigadier-General E. D. Keyes.\r\n\r\n2. That the divisions now commanded by the officers above assigned to\r\nthe commands of army corps shall be embraced in and form part of their\r\nrespective corps.\r\n\r\n3. The forces left for the defense of Washington will be placed in command\r\nof Brigadier-General James S. Wadsworth, who shall also be military\r\ngovernor of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n4. That this order be executed with such promptness and dispatch as not\r\nto delay the commencement of the operations already directed to be\r\nunderwritten by the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n5. A fifth army corps, to be commanded by Major general N. P. Banks,\r\nwill be formed from his own and General Shields's (late General Lander's)\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT'S GENERAL WAR ORDER NO.3.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, MARCH 8,1862\r\n\r\nOrdered: That no change of the base of operations of the Army of the\r\nPotomac shall be made without leaving in and about Washington such a force\r\nas in the opinion of the general-in-chief and the commanders of all the\r\narmy corps shall leave said city entirely secure.\r\n\r\nThat no more than two army corps (about 50,000 troops) of said Army of\r\nthe Potomac shall be moved en route for a new base of operations until the\r\nnavigation of the Potomac from Washington to the Chesapeake Bay shall\r\nbe freed from enemy's batteries and other obstructions, or until the\r\nPresident shall hereafter give express permission.\r\n\r\nThat any movements as aforesaid en route for a new base of operations\r\nwhich may be ordered by the general-in-chief, and which may be intended to\r\nmove upon the Chesapeake Bay, shall begin to move upon the bay as early\r\nas the 18th day of March instant, and the general-in-chief shall be\r\nresponsible that it so move as early as that day.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That the army and navy co-operate in an immediate effort to\r\ncapture the enemy's batteries upon the Potomac between Washington and the\r\nChesapeake Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND SOME BORDER SLAVE STATE\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATIVES, BY HON. J. W. CRISFIELD.\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR:--I called, at the request of the President, to ask you to come\r\nto the White House tomorrow morning, at nine o'clock, and bring such of\r\nyour colleagues as are in town.\"\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nYesterday, on my return from church, I found Mr. Postmaster-General Blair\r\nin my room, writing the above note, which he immediately suspended, and\r\nverbally communicated the President's invitation, and stated that the\r\nPresident's purpose was to have some conversation with the delegations of\r\nKentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, in explanation of\r\nhis message of the 6th instant.\r\n\r\nThis morning these delegations, or such of them as were in town, assembled\r\nat the White House at the appointed time, and after some little delay were\r\nadmitted to an audience. Mr. Leary and myself were the only members from\r\nMaryland present, and, I think, were the only members of the delegation at\r\nthat time in the city. I know that Mr. Pearoe, of the Senate, and Messrs.\r\nWebster and Calvert, of the House, were absent.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual salutations, and we were seated, the President said, in\r\nsubstance, that he had invited us to meet him to have some conversation\r\nwith us in explanation of his message of the 6th; that since he had sent\r\nit in several of the gentlemen then present had visited him, but had\r\navoided any allusion to the message, and he therefore inferred that the\r\nimport of the message had been misunderstood, and was regarded as inimical\r\nto the interests we represented; and he had resolved he would talk with\r\nus, and disabuse our minds of that erroneous opinion.\r\n\r\nThe President then disclaimed any intent to injure the interests or wound\r\nthe sensibilities of the slave States. On the contrary, his purpose was to\r\nprotect the one and respect the other; that we were engaged in a terrible,\r\nwasting, and tedious war; immense armies were in the field, and must\r\ncontinue in the field as long as the war lasts; that these armies must,\r\nof necessity, be brought into contact with slaves in the States we\r\nrepresented and in other States as they advanced; that slaves would come\r\nto the camps, and continual irritation was kept up; that he was constantly\r\nannoyed by conflicting and antagonistic complaints: on the one side a\r\ncertain class complained if the slave was not protected by the army;\r\npersons were frequently found who, participating in these views, acted\r\nin a way unfriendly to the slaveholder; on the other hand, slaveholders\r\ncomplained that their rights were interfered with, their slaves induced\r\nto abscond and protected within the lines; these complaints were numerous,\r\nloud and deep; were a serious annoyance to him and embarrassing to the\r\nprogress of the war; that it kept alive a spirit hostile to the government\r\nin the States we represented; strengthened the hopes of the Confederates\r\nthat at some day the border States would unite with them, and thus tend\r\nto prolong the war; and he was of opinion, if this resolution should be\r\nadopted by Congress and accepted by our States, these causes of irritation\r\nand these hopes would be removed, and more would be accomplished toward\r\nshortening the war than could be hoped from the greatest victory achieved\r\nby Union armies; that he made this proposition in good faith, and desired\r\nit to be accepted, if at all, voluntarily, and in the same patriotic\r\nspirit in which it was made; that emancipation was a subject exclusively\r\nunder the control of the States, and must be adopted or rejected by each\r\nfor itself; that he did not claim nor had this government any right to\r\ncoerce them for that purpose; that such was no part of his purpose in\r\nmaking this proposition, and he wished it to be clearly understood; that\r\nhe did not expect us there to be prepared to give him an answer, but he\r\nhoped we would take the subject into serious consideration, confer\r\nwith one another, and then take such course as we felt our duty and the\r\ninterests of our constituents required of us.\r\n\r\nMr. Noell, of Missouri, said that in his State slavery was not considered\r\na permanent institution; that natural causes were there in operation which\r\nwould at no distant day extinguish it, and he did not think that this\r\nproposition was necessary for that; and, besides that, he and his\r\nfriends felt solicitous as to the message on account of the different\r\nconstructions which the resolution and message had received. The New York\r\nTribune was for it, and understood it to mean that we must accept gradual\r\nemancipation according to the plan suggested, or get something worse.\r\n\r\nThe President replied that he must not be expected to quarrel with the New\r\nYork Tribune before the right time; he hoped never to have to do it; he\r\nwould not anticipate events. In respect to emancipation in Missouri, he\r\nsaid that what had been observed by Mr. Noell was probably true, but the\r\noperation of these natural causes had not prevented the irritating conduct\r\nto which he had referred, or destroyed the hopes of the Confederates that\r\nMissouri would at some time merge herself alongside of them, which, in his\r\njudgment, the passage of this resolution by Congress and its acceptance by\r\nMissouri would accomplish.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisfield, of Maryland, asked what would be the effect of the refusal\r\nof the State to accept this proposal, and he desired to know if the\r\nPresident looked to any policy beyond the acceptance or rejection of this\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nThe President replied that he had no designs beyond the actions of the\r\nStates on this particular subject. He should lament their refusal to\r\naccept it, but he had no designs beyond their refusal of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Menzies, of Kentucky, inquired if the President thought there was\r\nany power except in the States themselves to carry out his scheme of\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nThe President replied that he thought there could not be. He then went\r\noff into a course of remarks not qualifying the foregoing declaration nor\r\nmaterial to be repeated to a just understanding of his meaning.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisfield said he did not think the people of Maryland looked upon\r\nslavery as a permanent institution; and he did not know that they would\r\nbe very reluctant to give it up if provision was made to meet the loss and\r\nthey could be rid of the race; but they did not like to be coerced\r\ninto emancipation, either by the direct action of the government or by\r\nindirection, as through the emancipation of slaves in this District, or\r\nthe confiscation of Southern property as now threatened; and he thought\r\nbefore they would consent to consider this proposition they would require\r\nto be informed on these points. The President replied that, unless he was\r\nexpelled by the act of God or the Confederate armies he should occupy\r\nthat house for three years; and as long as he remained there Maryland had\r\nnothing to fear either for her institutions or her interests on the points\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisfield immediately added: \"Mr. President, if what you now say could\r\nbe heard by the people of Maryland, they would consider your proposition\r\nwith a much better feeling than I fear without it they will be inclined to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nThe President: \"That [meaning a publication of what he said] will not\r\ndo; it would force me into a quarrel before the proper time \"; and,\r\nagain intimating, as he had before done, that a quarrel with the \"Greeley\r\nfaction\" was impending, he said he did not wish to encounter it before the\r\nproper time, nor at all if it could be avoided.\r\n\r\n[The Greely faction wanted an immediate Emancipation Proclamation. D.W.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Wickliffe, of Kentucky, then asked him respecting the\r\nconstitutionality of his scheme.\r\n\r\nThe President replied: \"As you may suppose, I have considered that;\r\nand the proposition now submitted does not encounter any constitutional\r\ndifficulty. It proposes simply to co-operate with any State by giving such\r\nState pecuniary aid\"; and he thought that the resolution, as proposed by\r\nhim, would be considered rather as the expression of a sentiment than as\r\ninvolving any constitutional question.\r\n\r\nMr. Hall, of Missouri, thought that if this proposition was adopted at all\r\nit should be by the votes of the free States, and come as a proposition\r\nfrom them to the slave States, affording them an inducement to put aside\r\nthis subject of discord; that it ought not to be expected that members\r\nrepresenting slaveholding constituencies should declare at once, and in\r\nadvance of any proposition to them, for the emancipation of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe President said he saw and felt the force of the objection; it was a\r\nfearful responsibility, and every gentleman must do as he thought best;\r\nthat he did not know how this scheme was received by the members from the\r\nfree States; some of them had spoken to him and received it kindly; but\r\nfor the most part they were as reserved and chary as we had been, and he\r\ncould not tell how they would vote. And in reply to some expression of Mr.\r\nHall as to his own opinion regarding slavery, he said he did not pretend\r\nto disguise his anti-slavery feeling; that he thought it was wrong, and\r\nshould continue to think so; but that was not the question we had to deal\r\nwith now. Slavery existed, and that, too, as well by the act of the North\r\nas of the South; and in any scheme to get rid of it the North as well as\r\nthe South was morally bound to do its full and equal share. He thought the\r\ninstitution wrong and ought never to have existed; but yet he recognized\r\nthe rights of property which had grown out of it, and would respect those\r\nrights as fully as similar rights in any other property; that property can\r\nexist and does legally exist. He thought such a law wrong, but the rights\r\nof property resulting must be respected; he would get rid of the odious\r\nlaw, not by violating the rights, but by encouraging the proposition and\r\noffering inducements to give it up.\r\n\r\nHere the interview, so far as this subject is concerned, terminated by\r\nMr. Crittenden's assuring the President that, whatever might be our final\r\naction, we all thought him solely moved by a high patriotism and sincere\r\ndevotion to the happiness and glory of his country; and with that\r\nconviction we should consider respectfully the important suggestions he\r\nhad made.\r\n\r\nAfter some conversation on the current war news, we retired, and\r\nI immediately proceeded to my room and wrote out this paper. J. W.\r\nCRISFIELD.\r\n\r\nWe were present at the interview described in the foregoing paper of\r\nMr. Crisfield, and we certify that the substance of what passed on the\r\noccasion is in this paper faithfully and fully given.\r\n\r\nJ. W. MENZIES, J. J. CRITTENDEN, R. MALLORY.\r\n\r\nMarch 10, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT'S SPECIAL WAR ORDER NO.3.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nMajor-General McClellan having personally taken the field at the head of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac, until otherwise ordered he is relieved from the\r\ncommand of the other military departments, he retaining command of the\r\nDepartment of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nOrdered further, That the departments now under the respective commands of\r\nGenerals Halleck and Hunter, together with so much of that under General\r\nBuell as lies west of a north and south line indefinitely drawn through\r\nKnoxville, Tenn., be consolidated and designated the Department of the\r\nMississippi, and that until otherwise ordered Major General Halleck have\r\ncommand of said department.\r\n\r\nOrdered also, That the country west of the Department of the Potomac and\r\neast of the Department of the Mississippi be a military department, to\r\nbe called the Mountain Department, and that the same be commanded by\r\nMajor-General Fremont.\r\n\r\nThat all the commanders of departments, after the receipt of this order by\r\nthem, respectively report severally and directly to the Secretary of War,\r\nand that prompt, full, and frequent reports will be expected of all and\r\neach of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

MCCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nThe President, having considered the plan of operations agreed upon by\r\nyourself and the commanders of army corps, makes no objection to the same\r\nbut gives the following directions as to its execution:\r\n\r\n1. Leave such force at Manassas Junction as shall make it entirely certain\r\nthat the enemy shall no repossess himself of that position and line of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n2. Leave Washington entirely secure.\r\n\r\n3. Move the remainder of the force down the Potomac, choosing a new base\r\nat Fortress Monroe or anywhere between here and there, or, at all events,\r\nmove such remainder of the army at once in pursuit of the enemy by some\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nEDWARD M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH TO A PARTY OF MASSACHUSETTS GENTLEMAN\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MARCH 13, 1862\r\n\r\nI thank you, Mr. Train, for your kindness in presenting me with this truly\r\nelegant and highly creditable specimen of the handiwork of the mechanics\r\nof your State of Massachusetts, and I beg of you to express my hearty\r\nthanks to the donors. It displays a perfection of workmanship which I\r\nreally wish I had time to acknowledge in more fitting words, and I might\r\nthen follow your idea that it is suggestive, for it is evidently expected\r\nthat a good deal of whipping is to be done. But as we meet here socially\r\nlet us not think only of whipping rebels, or of those who seem to think\r\nonly of whipping negroes, but of those pleasant days, which it is to be\r\nhoped are in store for us, when seated behind a good pair of horses we can\r\ncrack our whips and drive through a peaceful, happy, and prosperous land.\r\nWith this idea, gentlemen, I must leave you for my business duties. [It\r\nwas likely a Buggy-Whip D.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, March 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nThe third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved December 21, 1861, provides:\r\n\r\n\"That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the retired\r\nlist of the navy for the command of squadrons and single ships such\r\nofficers as he may believe the good of the service requires to be thus\r\nplaced in command; and such officers may, if upon the recommendation of\r\nthe President of the United States they shall receive a vote of thanks cf\r\nCongress for their services and gallantry in action against an enemy, be\r\nrestored to the active list, and not otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, Captain Samuel F. Du Pont, of the navy, was\r\nnominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command of\r\nthe squadron which recently rendered such important service to the Union\r\nin the expedition to the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence as\r\nan example, I cordially recommend that Captain Samuel F. Du Pont receive a\r\nvote of thanks of Congress for his service and gallantry displayed in the\r\ncapture since the 21st December, 1861, of various ports on the coasts of\r\nGeorgia and Florida, particularly Brunswick, Cumberland Island and Sound,\r\nAmelia Island, the towns of St. Mary's, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville\r\nand Fernandina.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, MARCH 31, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:-This morning I felt constrained to order Blenker's division\r\nto Fremont, and I write this to assure you I did so with great pain,\r\nunderstanding that you would wish it otherwise. If you could know the\r\nfull pressure of the case, I am confident that you would justify it, even\r\nbeyond a mere acknowledgment that the commander-in-chief may order what he\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIFT OF SOME RABBITS\r\n\r\nTO MICHAEL CROCK. 360 N. Fourth St., Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:-Allow me to thank you in behalf of my little son for your\r\npresent of white rabbits. He is very much pleased with them.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTION TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, April 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War will order that one or the other of the corps of\r\nGeneral McDowell and General Sumner remain in front of Washington until\r\nfurther orders from the department, to operate at or in the direction of\r\nManassas Junction, or otherwise, as occasion may require; that the other\r\nCorps not so ordered to remain go forward to General McClellan as speedily\r\nas possible; that General McClellan commence his forward movements from\r\nhis new base at once, and that such incidental modifications as the\r\nforegoing may render proper be also made. A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours of 11 A. M. today received. Secretary of War informs me that the\r\nforwarding of transportation, ammunition, and Woodbury's brigade, under\r\nyour orders, is not, and will not be, interfered with. You now have\r\nover one hundred thousand troops with you, independent of General Wool's\r\ncommand. I think you better break the enemy's line from Yorktown to\r\nWarwick River at once. This will probably use time as advantageously as\r\nyou can.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 9, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR+--Your despatches, complaining that you are not properly\r\nsustained, while they do not offend me, do pain me very much.\r\n\r\nBlenker's division was withdrawn from you before you left here, and you\r\nknew the pressure under which I did it, and, as I thought, acquiesced in\r\nit certainly not without reluctance.\r\n\r\nAfter you left I ascertained that less than 20,000 unorganized men,\r\nwithout a single field battery, were all you designed to be left for the\r\ndefense of Washington and Manassas Junction, and part of this even to go\r\nto General Hooker's old position; General Banks's corps, once designed for\r\nManassas Junction, was divided and tied up on the line of Winchester and\r\nStrasburg, and could not leave it without again exposing the upper Potomac\r\nand the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This presented (or would present when\r\nMcDowell and Sumner should be gone) a great temptation to the enemy to\r\nturn back from the Rappahannock and sack Washington. My explicit order\r\nthat Washington should, by the judgment of all the Commanders of corps, be\r\nleft entirely secure, had been neglected. It was precisely this that drove\r\nme to detain McDowell.\r\n\r\nI do not forget that I was satisfied with your arrangement to leave Banks\r\nat Manassas Junction; but when that arrangement was broken up and nothing\r\nsubstituted for it, of course I was not satisfied. I was constrained to\r\nsubstitute something for it myself.\r\n\r\nAnd now allow me to ask, do you really think I should permit the line from\r\nRichmond via Manaasas Junction to this city to be entirely open, except\r\nwhat resistance could be presented by less than 20,000 unorganized troops?\r\nThis is a question which the country will not allow me to evade.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious mystery about the number of the troops now with you.\r\nWhen I telegraphed you on the 6th, saying you had over 100,000 with you, I\r\nhad just obtained from the Secretary of War a statement, taken as he said\r\nfrom your own returns, making 108,000 then with you and en route to you.\r\nYou now say you will have but 85,000 when all enroute to you shall have\r\nreached you. How can this discrepancy of 23,000 be accounted for?\r\n\r\nAs to General Wool's command, I understand it is doing for you precisely\r\nwhat a like number of your own would have to do if that command was away.\r\nI suppose the whole force which has gone forward to you is with you by\r\nthis time; and if so, I think it is the precise time for you to strike a\r\nblow. By delay the enemy will relatively gain upon you--that is, he\r\nwill gain faster by fortifications and reinforcements than you can by\r\nreinforcements alone.\r\n\r\nAnd once more let me tell you it is indispensable to you that you strike a\r\nblow. I am powerless to help this. You will do me the justice to remember\r\nI always insisted that going down the bay in search of a field, instead\r\nof fighting at or near Manassas, was only shifting and not surmounting\r\na difficulty; that we would find the same enemy and the same or equal\r\nentrenchments at either place. The country will not fail to note--is\r\nnoting now--that the present hesitation to move upon an entrenched enemy\r\nis but the story of Manassas repeated.\r\n\r\nI beg to assure you that I have never written you or spoken to you in\r\ngreater kindness of feeling than now, nor with a fuller purpose to sustain\r\nyou, so far as in my most anxious judgment I consistently can; but you\r\nmust act.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Saint Louis, Mo.: If the rigor of the confinement\r\nof Magoffin (Governor of Kentucky) at Alton is endangering his life, or\r\nmaterially impairing his health, I wish it mitigated as far as it can be\r\nconsistently with his safe detention.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nPlease send above, by order of the President. JOHN HAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION RECOMMENDING THANKSGIVING FOR VICTORIES,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nIt has pleased Almighty God to vouchsafe signal victories to the land and\r\nnaval forces engaged in suppressing, an internal rebellion, and at the\r\nsame time to avert from our country the dangers of foreign intervention\r\nand invasion.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore recommended to the people of the United States that at\r\ntheir next weekly assemblages in their accustomed places of public worship\r\nwhich shall occur after notice of this proclamation shall have been\r\nreceived, they especially acknowledge and render thanks to our Heavenly\r\nFather for these inestimable blessings, that they then and there implore\r\nspiritual consolation in behalf of all who have been brought into\r\naffliction by the casualties and calamities of sedition and civil war, and\r\nthat they reverently invoke the divine guidance for our national counsels,\r\nto the end that they may speedily result in the restoration of peace,\r\nharmony, and unity throughout our borders and hasten the establishment of\r\nfraternal relations among all the countries of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this tenth day of April, A.D. 1862, and of\r\nthe independence of the United States the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOLISHING SLAVERY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. April 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: The act\r\nentitled \"An act for the relief of certain persons held to service or\r\nlabor in the District of Columbia\" has this day been approved and signed.\r\n\r\nI have never doubted the constitutional authority of Congress to abolish\r\nslavery in this District, and I have ever desired to see the national\r\ncapital freed from the institution in some satisfactory way. Hence there\r\nhas never been in my mind any question on the subject except the one of\r\nexpediency, arising in view of all the circumstances. If there be matters\r\nwithin and about this act which might have taken a course or shape more\r\nsatisfactory to my judgment, I do not attempt to specify them. I am\r\ngratified that the two principles of compensation and colonization are\r\nboth recognized and practically applied in the act.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of compensation, it is provided that claims may be presented\r\nwithin ninety days from the passage of the act, \"but not thereafter\"; and\r\nthere is no saving for minors, femmes covert, insane or absent persons. I\r\npresume this is an omission by mere oversight, and I recommend that it be\r\nsupplied by an amendatory or supplemental act.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of the 19th was received that day. Fredericksburg is\r\nevacuated and the bridges destroyed by the enemy, and a small part of\r\nMcDowell's command occupies this side of the Rappahannock, opposite the\r\ntown. He purposes moving his whole force to that point.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO POSTMASTER-GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nHon. POSTMASTER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The member of Congress from the district including Tiffin,\r\nO., calls on me about the postmaster at that place. I believe I turned\r\nover a despatch to you from some persons there, asking a suspension, so\r\nas for them to be heard, or something of the sort. If nothing, or nothing\r\namounting to anything, has been done, I think the suspension might now be\r\nsuspended, and the commission go forward.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 29, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nWould it derange or embarrass your operations if I were to appoint Captain\r\nCharles Griffin a brigadier-general of volunteers? Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE, MAY 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate [of April 22] in relation to\r\nBrigadier-General Stone, I have the honor to state that he was arrested\r\nand imprisoned under my general authority, and upon evidence which whether\r\nhe be guilty or innocent, required, as appears to me, such proceedings to\r\nbe had against him for the public safety. I deem it incompatible with the\r\npublic interest, as also, perhaps, unjust to General Stone, to make a more\r\nparticular statement of the evidence.\r\n\r\nHe has not been tried because, in the state of military operations at the\r\ntime of his arrest and since, the officers to constitute a court martial\r\nand for witnesses could not be withdrawn from duty without serious injury\r\nto the service. He will be allowed a trial without any unnecessary delay;\r\nthe charges and specifications will be furnished him in due season, and\r\nevery facility for his defense will be afforded him by the War Department.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour call for Parrott guns from Washington alarms me, chiefly because it\r\nargues indefinite procrastination. Is anything to be done?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, MAY 1, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Pittsburgh Landing, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nI am pressed by the Missouri members of Congress to give General Schofield\r\nindependent command in Missouri. They insist that for want of this their\r\nlocal troubles gradually grow worse. I have forborne, so far, for fear of\r\ninterfering with and embarrassing your operations. Please answer telling\r\nme whether anything, and what, I can do for them without injuriously\r\ninterfering with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO EVANGELICAL LUTHERANS, MAY 6, 1862\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--I welcome here the representatives of the Evangelical\r\nLutherans of the United States. I accept with gratitude their assurances\r\nof the sympathy and support of that enlightened, influential, and loyal\r\nclass of my fellow citizens in an important crisis which involves, in my\r\njudgment, not only the civil and religious liberties of our own dear land,\r\nbut in a large degree the civil and religious liberties of mankind in many\r\ncountries and through many ages. You well know, gentlemen, and the world\r\nknows, how reluctantly I accepted this issue of battle forced upon me on\r\nmy advent to this place by the internal enemies of our country. You all\r\nknow, the world knows, the forces and the resources the public agents have\r\nbrought into employment to sustain a government against which there has\r\nbeen brought not one complaint of real injury committed against society\r\nat home or abroad. You all may recollect that in taking up the sword thus\r\nforced into our hands this government appealed to the prayers of the pious\r\nand the good, and declared that it placed its whole dependence on the\r\nfavor of God. I now humbly and reverently, in your presence, reiterate the\r\nacknowledgment of that dependence, not doubting that, if it shall please\r\nthe Divine Being who determines the destinies of nations, this shall\r\nremain a united people, and that they will, humbly seeking the divine\r\nguidance, make their prolonged national existence a source of new benefits\r\nto themselves and their successors, and to all classes and conditions of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO FLAG-OFFICER L. M. GOLDSBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nFORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, MAY 7, 1862\r\n\r\nFLAG-OFFICER GOLDSBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Major-General McClellan telegraphs that he has ascertained by a\r\nreconnaissance that the battery at Jamestown has been abandoned, and he\r\nagain requests that gunboats may be sent up the James River.\r\n\r\nIf you have tolerable confidence that you can successfully contend with\r\nthe Merrimac without the help of the Galena and two accompanying gunboats,\r\nsend the Galena and two gunboats up the James River at once. Please report\r\nyour action on this to me at once. I shall be found either at General\r\nWool's headquarters or on board the Miami.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER REPRIMAND OF McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nFORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, May 9, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have just assisted the Secretary of War in framing part of\r\na despatch to you relating to army corps, which despatch, of course, will\r\nhave reached you long before this will. I wish to say a few words to you\r\nprivately on this subject. I ordered the army corps organization not only\r\non the unanimous opinion of the twelve generals whom you had selected and\r\nassigned as generals of divisions, but also on the unanimous opinion of\r\nevery military man I could get an opinion from, and every modern military\r\nbook, yourself only excepted. Of course, I did not on my own judgment\r\npretend to understand the subject. I now think it indispensable for you to\r\nknow how your struggle against it is received in quarters which we cannot\r\nentirely disregard. It is looked upon as merely an effort to pamper one or\r\ntwo pets, and to persecute and degrade their supposed rivals. I have had\r\nno word from Sumner, Heintzleman, or Keyes the commanders of these corps\r\nare, of course, the three highest officers with you; but I am constantly\r\ntold that you have no consultation or communication with them; that you\r\nconsult and communicate with nobody but General Fitz John Porter, and\r\nperhaps General Franklin. I do not say these complaints are true or just;\r\nbut at all events, it is proper you should know of their existence. Do the\r\ncommanders of corps disobey your orders in anything?\r\n\r\nWhen you relieved General Hamilton of his command the other day, you\r\nthereby lost the confidence of at least one of your best friends in the\r\nSenate. And here let me say, not as applicable to you personally, that\r\nSenators and Representatives speak of me in their places without question,\r\nand that officers of the army must cease addressing insulting letters to\r\nthem for taking no greater liberty with them.\r\n\r\nBut to return. Are you strong enough--are you strong enough even with my\r\nhelp--to set your foot upon the necks of Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes\r\nall at once? This is a practical and very serious question to you?\r\n\r\nThe success of your army and the cause of the country are the same, and,\r\nof course, I only desire the good of the cause.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FLAG-OFFICER L. M. GOLDSBOROUGH,\r\n\r\nFORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, May 10, 1862\r\n\r\nFLAG-OFFICER GOLDSBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I send you this copy of your report of yesterday for the\r\npurpose of saying to you in writing that you are quite right in supposing\r\nthe movement made by you and therein reported was made in accordance with\r\nmy wishes verbally expressed to you in advance. I avail myself of the\r\noccasion to thank you for your courtesy and all your conduct, so far as\r\nknown to me, during my brief visit here.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION RAISING THE BLOCKADE OF CERTAIN PORTS.\r\n\r\nMay 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, by my proclamation of the 19th of April, one thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-one, it was declared that the ports of certain States,\r\nincluding those of Beaufort, in the State of North Carolina, Port\r\nRoyal, in the State of South Carolina, and New Orleans, in the State of\r\nLouisiana, were, for reasons therein set forth, intended to be placed\r\nunder blockade; and whereas the said ports of Beaufort, Port Royal, and\r\nNew Orleans have since been blockaded; but as the blockade of the same\r\nports may now be safely relaxed with advantage to the interests of\r\ncommerce:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section\r\nof the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July last, entitled \"An act\r\nfurther to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for\r\nother purposes,\" do hereby declare that the blockade of the said ports of\r\nBeaufort, Port Royal, and New Orleans shall so far cease and determine,\r\nfrom and after the first day of June next, that commercial intercourse\r\nwith those ports, except as to persons, things, and information contraband\r\nof war, may from that time be carried on, subject to the laws of the\r\nUnited States, and to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations\r\nwhich are prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in his order of this\r\ndate, which is appended to this proclamation.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this twelfth day of May, in the year of\r\nour Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence\r\nof the United States the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Farragut was nominated to\r\nthe Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command of the squadron\r\nwhich recently rendered such important service to the Union by his\r\nsuccessful operations on the lower Mississippi and capture of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence as\r\nan example, I cordially recommend that Captain D. G. Farragut receive a\r\nvote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry displayed in the\r\ncapture since 21st December, 1861, of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, city\r\nof New Orleans, and the destruction of various rebel gunboats, rams,\r\netc.....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith a list of naval officers who commanded vessels\r\nengaged in the recent brilliant operations of the squadron commanded by\r\nFlag-officer Farragut which led to the capture of Forts Jackson and St.\r\nPhilip, city of New Orleans, and the destruction of rebel gunboats, rams,\r\netc., in April 1862. For their services and gallantry on those occasions I\r\ncordially recommend that they should, by name, receive a vote of thanks of\r\nCongress:\r\n\r\nLIST:\r\n\r\n     Captain Theodorus Bailey.\r\n     Captain Henry W.

McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, May 15, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN, Cumberland, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour long despatch of yesterday is just received. I will answer more fully\r\nsoon. Will say now that all your despatches to the Secretary of War have\r\nbeen promptly shown to me. Have done and shall do all I could and can to\r\nsustain you. Hoped that the opening of James River and putting Wool and\r\nBurnside in communication, with an open road to Richmond, or to you, had\r\neffected something in that direction. I am still unwilling to take all our\r\nforce off the direct line between Richmond and here.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH TO THE 12TH INDIANA REGIMENT, MAY [15?] 1862\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS, OF THE TWELFTH INDIANA REGIMENT:\r\n\r\nIt has not been customary heretofore, nor will it be hereafter, for me\r\nto say something to every regiment passing in review. It occurs too\r\nfrequently for me to have speeches ready on all occasions. As you have\r\npaid such a mark of respect to the chief magistrate, it appears that I\r\nshould say a word or two in reply. Your colonel has thought fit, on his\r\nown account and in your name, to say that you are satisfied with the\r\nmanner in which I have performed my part in the difficulties which have\r\nsurrounded the nation. For your kind expressions I am extremely grateful,\r\nbut on the other hand I assure you that the nation is more indebted to\r\nyou, and such as you, than to me. It is upon the brave hearts and strong\r\narms of the people of the country that our reliance has been placed in\r\nsupport of free government and free institutions.\r\n\r\nFor the part which you and the brave army of which you are a part have,\r\nunder Providence, performed in this great struggle, I tender more thanks\r\nespecially to this regiment, which has been the subject of good report.\r\nThe thanks of the nation will follow you, and may God's blessing rest upon\r\nyou now and forever. I hope that upon your return to your homes you will\r\nfind your friends and loved ones well and happy. I bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL:\r\n\r\nWhat is the strength of your force now actually with you?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM OF PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS OF ABOVE DATE\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL McDOWELL, AND GENERAL MEIGS'S INDORSEMENT THEREON.\r\n\r\nMay 17, 1862. You will retain the separate command of the forces taken\r\nwith you; but while co-operating with General McClellan you will obey his\r\norders, except that you are to judge, and are not to allow your force to\r\nbe disposed otherwise than so as to give the greatest protection to this\r\ncapital which may be possible from that distance.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nThe President having shown this to me, I suggested that it is dangerous to\r\ndirect a subordinate not to obey the orders of his superior in any case,\r\nand that to give instructions to General McClellan to this same end and\r\nfurnish General McDowell with a copy thereof would effect the object\r\ndesired by the President. He desired me to say that the sketch of\r\ninstructions to General McClellan herewith he thought made this addition\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, M. C. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT RELATING TO GENERAL DAVID HUNTER'S ORDER OF MILITARY\r\nEMANCIPATION,\r\n\r\nMAY 17, 1862\r\n\r\nNo commanding general shall do such a thing upon my responsibility without\r\nconsulting me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 18, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Your despatch to the President, asking reinforcements, has been\r\nreceived and carefully considered.\r\n\r\nThe President is not willing to uncover the capital entirely; and it is\r\nbelieved that, even if this were prudent, it would require more time to\r\neffect a junction between your army and that of the Rappahannock by\r\nthe way of the Potomac and York rivers than by a land march. In order,\r\ntherefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the\r\nearliest moment, General McDowell has been ordered to march upon that city\r\nby the shortest route. He is ordered, keeping himself always in position\r\nto save the capital from all possible attack, so to operate as to put his\r\nleft wing in communication with your right wing, and you are instructed\r\nto co-operate so as to establish this communication as soon as possible by\r\nextending your right-wing to the north of Richmond.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that this communication can be safely established either\r\nnorth or south of the Pamunkey River.\r\n\r\nIn any event, you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemy's\r\nforces from leaving Richmond and falling in overwhelming force upon\r\nGeneral McDowell. He will move with between thirty-five and forty thousand\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nA copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with this. The specific\r\ntask assigned to his command has been to provide against any danger to the\r\ncapital of the nation.\r\n\r\nAt your earnest call for reinforcements, he is sent forward to co-operate\r\nin the reduction of Richmond, but charged, in attempting this, not to\r\nuncover the city of Washington; and you will give no order, either before\r\nor after your junction, which can put him out of position to cover\r\nthis city. You and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or\r\notherwise as frequently as may be necessary for efficient cooperation.\r\nWhen General McDowell is in position on your right, his supplies must be\r\ndrawn from West Point, and you will instruct your staff-officers to be\r\nprepared to supply him by that route.\r\n\r\nThe President desires that General McDowell retain the command of the\r\nDepartment of the Rappahannock and of the forces with which he moves\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:  EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, Commanding Army of the Potomac, before\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION REVOKING GENERAL HUNTER'S ORDER OF MILITARY EMANCIPATION,\r\n\r\nMAY 19, 1862.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nWhereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a\r\nproclamation of Major general Hunter, in the words and figures following,\r\nto wit:\r\n\r\n(General Orders No. 11) HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, HILTON HEAD,\r\nPORT ROYAL, S. C., May 9, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"The three States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, comprising the\r\nmilitary department of the South, having deliberately declared themselves\r\nno longer under the protection of the United States of America, and\r\nhaving taken up arms against the said United States, it became a military\r\nnecessity to declare martial law. This was accordingly done on the\r\n25th day of April, 1862. Slavery and martial law in a free country are\r\naltogether incompatible. The persons in these three States: Georgia\r\nFlorida, and South Carolina--heretofore held as slaves are therefore\r\ndeclared forever free.\r\n\r\n\"By command of Major-General D. Hunter: \"(Official.)ED. W. SMITH, \"Acting\r\nAssistant Adjutant-General.\"\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the same is producing some excitement and misunderstanding:\r\ntherefore,\r\n\r\nI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, proclaim and declare\r\nthat the Government of the United States, had no knowledge, information,\r\nor belief of an intention on the part of General Hunter to issue such a\r\nproclamation; nor has it yet any authentic information that the document\r\nis genuine. And further, that neither General Hunter nor any other\r\ncommander or person has been authorized by the Government of the United\r\nStates to make a proclamation declaring the slaves of any State free; and\r\nthat the supposed proclamation now in question, whether genuine or false,\r\nis altogether void so far as respects such a declaration.\r\n\r\nI further make known that whether it be competent for me, as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy, to declare the slaves of any\r\nState or States free, and whether, at any time, in any case, it shall have\r\nbecome a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government to\r\nexercise such supposed power, are questions which under my responsibility\r\nI reserve to myself, and which I cannot feel justified in leaving to the\r\ndecision of commanders in the field.\r\n\r\nThese are totally different questions from those of police regulations in\r\narmies and camps.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day of March last, by special message, I recommended to\r\nCongress the adoption of a joint resolution, to be substantially as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nResolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State which\r\nmay adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary\r\naid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to compensate for the\r\ninconvenience, public and private, produced by such change of system.\r\n\r\nThe resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large\r\nmajorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic,\r\ndefinite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the States and people\r\nmost immediately interested in the subject-matter. To the people of those\r\nStates I now earnestly appeal. I do not argue--I beseech you to make\r\narguments for yourselves. You cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs\r\nof the times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them,\r\nranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan politics. This\r\nproposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no reproaches\r\nupon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The change it contemplates would come\r\ngently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything. Will you\r\nnot embrace it? So much good has not been done, by one effort, in all past\r\ntime, as in the providence of God it is now your high privilege to do. May\r\nthe vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of May, in the year of\r\nour Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence\r\nof the United States the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. E. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI have just been waited on by a large committee who present a petition\r\nsigned by twenty-three senators and eighty-four representatives asking me\r\nto restore General Hamilton to his division. I wish to do this, and yet I\r\ndo not wish to be understood as rebuking you. Please answer at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, May 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour long despatch of yesterday just received. You will have just such\r\ncontrol of General McDowell and his forces as you therein indicate.\r\nMcDowell can reach you by land sooner than he could get aboard of boats,\r\nif the boats were ready at Fredericksburg, unless his march shall be\r\nresisted, in which case the force resisting him will certainly not be\r\nconfronting you at Richmond. By land he can reach you in five days after\r\nstarting, whereas by water he would not reach you in two weeks, judging by\r\npast experience. Franklin's single division did not reach you in ten days\r\nafter I ordered it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nPresident United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 24, 1862. 4 PM.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nIn consequence of General Banks's critical position, I have been compelled\r\nto suspend General McDowell's movements to join you. The enemy are making\r\na desperate push upon Harper's Ferry, and we are trying to throw General\r\nFremont's force and part of General McDowell's in their rear.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON May 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI left General McDowell's camp at dark last evening. Shields's command is\r\nthere, but it is so worn that he cannot move before Monday morning, the\r\n26th. We have so thinned our line to get troops for other places that it\r\nwas broken yesterday at Front Royal, with a probable loss to us of one\r\nregiment infantry, two Companies cavalry, putting General Banks in some\r\nperil.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's forces under General Anderson now opposing General McDowell's\r\nadvance have as their line of supply and retreat the road to Richmond.\r\n\r\nIf, in conjunction with McDowell's movement against Anderson, you\r\ncould send a force from your right to cut off the enemy's supplies from\r\nRichmond, preserve the railroad bridges across the two forks of the\r\nPamunkey, and intercept the enemy's retreat, you will prevent the army\r\nnow opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly 15,000\r\nmen; and if you succeed in saving the bridges you will secure a line of\r\nrailroad for supplies in addition to the one you now have. Can you not\r\ndo this almost as well as not while you are building the Chickahominy\r\nbridges? McDowell and Shields both say they can, and positively will, move\r\nMonday morning. I wish you to move cautiously and safely.\r\n\r\nYou will have command of McDowell, after he joins you, precisely as you\r\nindicated in your long despatch to us of the 21st.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL RUFUS SAXTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May, 24 1862. 2 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAXTON:\r\n\r\nGeary reports Jackson with 20,000 moving from Ashby's Gap by the Little\r\nRiver turnpike, through Aldie, toward Centreville. This he says is\r\nreliable. He is also informed of large forces south of him. We know\r\na force of some 15,000 broke up Saturday night from in front of\r\nFredericksburg and went we know not where. Please inform us, if possible,\r\nwhat has become of the force which pursued Banks yesterday; also any other\r\ninformation you have.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO COLONEL D. S. MILES.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862. 1.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL MILES, Harper's Ferry, Virginia\r\n\r\nCould you not send scouts from Winchester who would tell whether enemy are\r\nnorth of Banks, moving on Winchester? What is the latest you have?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862. 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Franklin:\r\n\r\nYou are authorized to purchase the 400 horses, or take them wherever or\r\nhowever you can get them. The exposed condition of General Banks makes\r\nhis immediate relief a point of paramount importance. You are therefore\r\ndirected by the President to move against Jackson at Harrisonburg and\r\noperate against the enemy in such way as to relieve Banks. This movement\r\nmust be made immediately. You will acknowledge the receipt of this order,\r\nand specify the hour it is received by you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862. 7.15 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Franklin, Virginia:\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the promptness with which you have answered that you will\r\nexecute the order. Much--perhaps all--depends upon the celerity with which\r\nyou can execute it. Put the utmost speed into it. Do not lose a minute.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, near Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nSeveral despatches from Assistant Secretary Scott and one from Governor\r\nMorton asking reinforcements for you have been received. I beg you to be\r\nassured we do the best we can. I mean to cast no blame where I tell you\r\neach of our commanders along our line from Richmond to Corinth supposes\r\nhimself to be confronted by numbers superior to his own. Under this\r\npressure We thinned the line on the upper Potomac, until yesterday it was\r\nbroken with heavy loss to us, and General Banks put in great peril, out of\r\nwhich he is not yet extricated, and may be actually captured. We need men\r\nto repair this breach, and have them not at hand. My dear General, I feel\r\njustified to rely very much on you. I believe you and the brave officers\r\nand men with you can and will get the victory at Corinth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Fredricksburg:\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont has been ordered by telegraph to move from Franklin on\r\nHarrisonburg to relieve General Banks, and capture or destroy Jackson's\r\nand Ewell's forces. You are instructed, laying aside for the present\r\nthe movement on Richmond, to put 20,000 men in motion at once for the\r\nShenandoah, moving on the line or in advance of the line of the Manassas\r\nGap railroad. Your object will be to capture the forces of Jackson and\r\nEwell, either in co-operation with General Fremont, or, in case want\r\nof supplies or of transportation, interferes with his movements, it is\r\nbelieved that the force which you move will be sufficient to accomplish\r\nthis object alone. The information thus far received here makes it\r\nprobable that if the enemy operate actively against General Banks, you\r\nwill not be able to count upon much assistance from him, but may even have\r\nto release him. Reports received this moment are that Banks is fighting\r\nwith Ewell eight miles from Winchester.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., May 24, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL I. McDOWELL:\r\n\r\nI am highly gratified by your alacrity in obeying my order. The change was\r\nas painful to me as it can possibly be to you or to any one. Everything\r\nnow depends upon the celerity and vigor of your movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. W. GEARY.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862 1.45 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL GEARY, White Plains:\r\n\r\nPlease give us your best present impression as to the number of the\r\nenemy's forces north of Strasburg and Front Royal. Are the forces still\r\nmoving north through the gap at Front Royal and between you and there?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 25, 1862. 2 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nThe enemy is moving north in sufficient force to drive General Banks\r\nbefore him--precisely in what force we cannot tell. He is also threatening\r\nLeesburg and Geary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, from both north and\r\nsouth--in precisely what force we cannot tell. I think the movement is a\r\ngeneral and concerted one, such as would not be if he was acting upon the\r\npurpose of a very desperate defense of Richmond. I think the time is near\r\nwhen you must either attack Richmond or give up the job and come to the\r\ndefense of Washington. Let me hear from you instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER TAKING MILITARY POSSESSION OF RAILROADS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered: By virtue of the authority vested by act of Congress, the\r\nPresident takes military possession of all the railroads in the United\r\nStates from and after this date until further order, and directs that the\r\nrespective railroad companies, their officers and servants, shall\r\nhold themselves in readiness for the transportation of such troops and\r\nmunitions of war as may be ordered by the military authorities, to the\r\nexclusion of all other business.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nM. C. MEIGS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY CHASE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY CHASE, Fredericksburg, Virginia:\r\n\r\nIt now appears that Banks got safely into Winchester last night, and is\r\nthis morning retreating on Harper's Ferry. This justifies the inference\r\nthat he is pressed by numbers superior to his own. I think it not\r\nimprobable that Ewell, Jackson, and Johnson are pouring through the gap\r\nthey made day before yesterday at Front Royal, making a dash northward. It\r\nwill be a very valuable and very honorable service for General McDowell\r\nto cut them off. I hope he will put all possible energy and speed into the\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. SAXTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAXTON, Harper's Ferry:\r\n\r\nIf Banks reaches Martinsburg, is he any the better for it? Will not the\r\nenemy cut him from thence to Harper's Ferry? Have you sent anything to\r\nmeet him and assist him at Martinsburg? This is an inquiry, not an order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. SAXTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862. 6.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAXTON, Harper's Ferry:\r\n\r\nOne good six-gun battery, complete in its men and appointments, is now on\r\nits way to you from Baltimore. Eleven other guns, of different sorts,\r\nare on their way to you from here. Hope they will all reach you before\r\nmorning. As you have but 2500 men at Harper's Ferry, where are the rest\r\nwhich were in that vicinity and which we have sent forward? Have any of\r\nthem been cut off?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. SAXTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAXTON, Harper's Ferry:\r\n\r\nI fear you have mistaken me. I did not mean to question the correctness of\r\nyour conduct; on the contrary! I approve what you have done. As the 2500\r\nreported by you seemed small to me, I feared some had got to Banks and\r\nbeen cut off with him. Please tell me the exact number you now have in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\n[Sent in cipher.]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., May 25,1862. 8.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch received. General Banks was at Strasburg, with about 6,000\r\nmen, Shields having been taken from him to swell a column for McDowell\r\nto aid you at Richmond, and the rest of his force scattered at various\r\nplaces. On the 23d a rebel force of 7000 to 10,000 fell upon one regiment\r\nand two companies guarding the bridge at Front Royal, destroying it\r\nentirely; crossed the Shenandoah, and on the 24th (yesterday) pushed to\r\nget north of Banks, on the road to Winchester. Banks ran a race with them,\r\nbeating them into Winchester yesterday evening. This morning a battle\r\nensued between the two forces, in which Banks was beaten back into full\r\nretreat toward Martinsburg, and probably is broken up into a total rout.\r\nGeary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, just now reports that Jackson is\r\nnow near Front Royal, With 10,000, following up and supporting, as I\r\nunderstand, the forces now pursuing Banks, also that another force of\r\n10,000 is near Orleans, following on in the same direction. Stripped here,\r\nas we are here, it will be all we can do to prevent them crossing the\r\nPotomac at Harper's Ferry or above. We have about 20,000 of McDowell's\r\nforce moving back to the vicinity of Front Royal, and General Fremont, who\r\nwas at Franklin, is moving to Harrisonburg; both these movements intended\r\nto get in the enemy's rear.\r\n\r\nOne more of McDowell's brigades is ordered through here to Harper's Ferry;\r\nthe rest of his force remains for the present at Fredericksburg. We are\r\nsending such regiments and dribs from here and Baltimore as we can spare\r\nto Harper's Ferry, supplying their places in some sort by calling in\r\nmilitia from the adjacent States. We also have eighteen cannon on the\r\nroad to Harper's Ferry, of which arm there is not a single one yet at that\r\npoint. This is now our situation.\r\n\r\nIf McDowell's force was now beyond our reach, we should be utterly\r\nhelpless. Apprehension of something like this, and no unwillingness to\r\nsustain you, has always been my reason for withholding McDowell's force\r\nfrom you. Please understand this, and do the best you can with the force\r\nyou have.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF CONSPIRACY OF REBELLION\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nMAY 16, 1862\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nThe insurrection which is yet existing in the United States and aims at\r\nthe overthrow of the Federal Constitution and the Union, was clandestinely\r\nprepared during the Winter of 1860 and 1861, and assumed an open\r\norganization in the form of a treasonable provisional government at\r\nMontgomery, in Alabama on the 18th day of February, 1861. On the 12th day\r\nof April, 1861, the insurgents committed the flagrant act of civil war by\r\nthe bombardment and the capture of Fort Sumter, Which cut off the hope of\r\nimmediate conciliation. Immediately afterward all the roads and avenues to\r\nthis city were obstructed, and the capital was put into the condition of\r\na siege. The mails in every direction were stopped and the lines of\r\ntelegraph cut off by the insurgents, and military and naval forces which\r\nhad been called out by the government for the defense of Washington were\r\nprevented from reaching the city by organized and combined treasonable\r\nresistance in the State of Maryland. There was no adequate and effective\r\norganization for the public defense. Congress had indefinitely adjourned.\r\nThere was no time to convene them. It became necessary for me to choose\r\nwhether, using only the existing means, agencies, and processes which\r\nCongress had provided, I should let the government fall at once into\r\nruin or whether, availing myself of the broader powers conferred by the\r\nConstitution in cases of insurrection, I would make an effort to save it,\r\nwith all its blessings, for the present age and for posterity.\r\n\r\nI thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers, the heads of all the\r\ndepartments, to meet on Sunday, the 20th day of April, 1861, at the\r\noffice of the Navy Department, and then and there, with their unanimous\r\nconcurrence, I directed that an armed revenue cutter should proceed to\r\nsea to afford protection to the commercial marine, and especially the\r\nCalifornia treasure ships then on their way to this coast. I also directed\r\nthe commandant of the navy-yard at Boston to purchase or charter and arm\r\nas quickly as possible five steamships for purposes of public defense. I\r\ndirected the commandant of the navy-yard at Philadelphia to purchase\r\nor charter and arm an equal number for the same purpose. I directed the\r\ncommandant at New York to purchase or charter and arm an equal number. I\r\ndirected Commander Gillis to purchase or charter and arm and put to sea\r\ntwo other vessels. Similar directions were given to Commodore Dupont,\r\nwith a view to the opening of passages by water to and from the capital.\r\nI directed the several officers to take the advice and obtain the aid and\r\nefficient services, in the matter, of his Excellency Edwin D. Morgan,\r\nthe Governor of New York, or in his absence George D. Morgan, William M.\r\nEvarts, R. M. Blatchford, and Moses H. Grinnell, who were by my directions\r\nespecially empowered by the Secretary of the Navy to act for his\r\ndepartment in that crisis in matters pertaining to the forwarding of\r\ntroops and supplies for the public defense.\r\n\r\nThe several departments of the government at that time contained so large\r\na number of disloyal persons that it would have been impossible to provide\r\nsafely through official agents only for the performance of the duties\r\nthus confided to citizens favorably known for their ability, loyalty, and\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\nThe several orders issued upon these occurrences were transmitted by\r\nprivate messengers, who pursued a circuitous way to the seaboard cities,\r\ninland across the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio and the northern lakes.\r\nI believe by these and other similar measures taken in that crisis, some\r\nof which were without any authority of law, the government was saved from\r\noverthrow. I am not aware that a dollar of the public funds thus confided\r\nwithout authority of law to unofficial persons was either lost or wasted,\r\nalthough apprehensions of such misdirection occurred to me as objections\r\nto those extraordinary proceedings, and were necessarily overruled.\r\n\r\nI recall these transactions now because my attention has been directed to\r\na resolution which was passed by the House of Representatives on the 30th\r\nday of last month, which is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War by investing\r\nAlexander Cummings with the control of large sums of the public money\r\nand authority to purchase military supplies without restriction, without\r\nrequiring from him any guaranty for the faithful performance of his\r\nduties, when the services of competent public officers were available, and\r\nby involving the government in a vast number of contracts with persons not\r\nlegitimately engaged in the business pertaining to the subject-matter of\r\nsuch contracts, especially in the purchase of arms for future delivery,\r\nhas adopted a policy highly injurious to the public service, and deserves\r\nthe censure of the House.\"\r\n\r\nCongress will see that I should be wanting equally in candor and in\r\njustice if I should leave the censure expressed in this resolution to rest\r\nexclusively or chiefly upon Mr. Cameron. The same sentiment is unanimously\r\nentertained by the heads of department who participated in the proceedings\r\nwhich the House of Representatives have censured. It is due to Mr. Cameron\r\nto say that although he fully approved the proceedings they were not moved\r\nnor suggested by himself, and that not only the President, but all the\r\nother heads of departments, were at least equally responsible with him for\r\nwhatever error, wrong, or fault was committed in the premises.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 26, 1862. 12.40\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nWe have General Banks's official report. He has saved his army and\r\nbaggage, and has made a safe retreat to the river, and is probably safe at\r\nWilliamsport. He reports the attacking force at 15,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 26, 1862. 1 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Falmouth, Virginia:\r\n\r\nDespatches from Geary just received have been sent you. Should not\r\nthe remainder of your forces, except sufficient to hold the point at\r\nFredericksburg, move this way--to Manassas Junction or Alexandria?\r\nAs commander of this department, should you not be here? I ask these\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nCan you not cut the Alula Creek railroad? Also, what impression have you\r\nas to intrenched works for you to contend with in front of Richmond? Can\r\nyou get near enough to throw shells into the city?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nMay 27.1862. 9.58 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nI see that you are at Moorefield. You were expressly ordered to march to\r\nHarrisonburg. What does this mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GOVERNOR ANDREW.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 27, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR ANDREW, Boston:\r\n\r\nThe President directs that the militia be relieved, and the enlistments\r\nmade for three years, or during the war. This, I think, will practically\r\nnot be longer than for a year. The latest intelligence from General Banks\r\nstates that he has saved nearly his whole command with small loss.\r\n\r\nConcentrations of our force have been made, which it is hoped will capture\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Moorefield\r\n\r\nThe President directs you to halt at Moorefield and await orders, unless\r\nyou hear of the enemy being in the general direction of Rodney, in which\r\ncase you will move upon him. Acknowledge the receipt of this order, and\r\nthe hour it is received.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan at 6.30 P.M. yesterday telegraphed that Fitz-John\r\nPorter's division had fought and driven 13,000 of the enemy, under General\r\nBranch, from Hanover Court-House, and was driving them from a stand they\r\nhad made on the railroad at the time the messenger left. Two hours later\r\nhe telegraphed that Stoneman had captured an engine and six cars on\r\nthe Virginia Central, which he at once sent to communicate with Porter.\r\nNothing further from McClellan.\r\n\r\nIf Porter effects a lodgment on both railroads near Hanover Court-House,\r\nconsider whether your forces in front of Fredericksburg should not push\r\nthrough and join him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nWhat of F.J. Porter's expedition? Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON. May 28, 1862. 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\r\n\r\nYou say General Geary's scouts report that they find no enemy this side of\r\nthe Blue Ridge. Neither do I. Have they been to the Blue Ridge looking for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862. 5.40 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\r\n\r\nI think the evidence now preponderates that Ewell and Jackson are still\r\nabout Winchester. Assuming this, it is for you a question of legs. Put in\r\nall the speed you can. I have told Fremont as much, and directed him to\r\ndrive at them as fast as possible. By the way, I suppose you know Fremont\r\nhas got up to Moorefield, instead of going into Harrisonburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON May 28, 1862. 8.40 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI am very glad of General F. J. Porter's victory. Still, if it was a\r\ntotal rout of the enemy, I am puzzled to know why the Richmond and\r\nFredericksburg railroad was not seized again, as you say you have all the\r\nrailroads but the Richmond and Fredericksburg. I am puzzled to see how,\r\nlacking that, you can have any, except the scrap from Richmond to\r\nWest Point. The scrap of the Virginia Central from Richmond to Hanover\r\nJunction, without more, is simply nothing. That the whole of the enemy is\r\nconcentrating on Richmond, I think cannot be certainly known to you or\r\nme. Saxton, at Harper's Ferry informs us that large forces, supposed to be\r\nJackson's and Ewells, forced his advance from Charlestown today. General\r\nKing telegraphs us from Fredericksburg that contrabands give certain\r\ninformation that 15,000 left Hanover Junction Monday morning to reinforce\r\nJackson. I am painfully impressed with the importance of the struggle\r\nbefore you, and shall aid you all I can consistently with my view of due\r\nregard to all points.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL JOHN C. FREMONT, Moorefield:\r\n\r\nThe order to remain at Moorefield was based on the supposition that it\r\nwould find you there.\r\n\r\nUpon subsequent information that the enemy were still operating in the\r\nvicinity of Winchester and Martinsburg, you were directed to move against\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThe President now again directs you to move against the enemy without\r\ndelay. Please acknowledge the receipt of this, and the time received.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MARCY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1862. 10 A.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R. B. MARCY, McClellan's Headquarters:\r\n\r\nYours just received. I think it cannot be certainly known whether the\r\nforce which fought General Porter is the same which recently confronted\r\nMcDowell. Another item of evidence bearing on it is that General Branch\r\ncommanded against Porter, while it was General Anderson who was in front\r\nof McDowell. He and McDowell were in correspondence about prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., May 29, 1862. 10.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI think we shall be able within three days to tell you certainly whether\r\nany considerable force of the enemy--Jackson or any one else--is moving\r\non to Harper's Ferry or vicinity. Take this expected development into your\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BANKS, Williamsport, Maryland:\r\n\r\nGeneral McDowell's advance should, and probably will, be at or near\r\nFront Royal at twelve (noon) tomorrow. General Fremont will be at or near\r\nStrasburg as soon. Please watch the enemy closely, and follow and harass\r\nand detain him if he attempts to retire. I mean this for General Saxton's\r\nforce as well as that immediately with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL FREMONT\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1862. 12 M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Moorefield, Virginia:\r\n\r\nGeneral McDowell's advance, if not checked by the enemy, should, and\r\nprobably will, be at Front Royal by twelve (noon) to-morrow. His force,\r\nwhen up, will be about 20,000. Please have your force at Strasburg, or, if\r\nthe route you are moving on does not lead to that point, as near Strasburg\r\nas the enemy may be by the same time. Your despatch No.30 received and\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont's force should, and probably will, be at or near Strasburg\r\nby twelve (noon) tomorrow. Try to have your force, or the advance of it,\r\nat Front Royal as soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MARCY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1862. 1.20 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R. B. MARCY:\r\n\r\nYour despatch as to the South Anna and Ashland being seized by our forces\r\nthis morning is received. Understanding these points to be on the Richmond\r\nand Fredericksburg railroad, I heartily congratulate the country, and\r\nthank General McClellan and his army for their seizure.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 30, 1862. 10 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\r\n\r\nI somewhat apprehend that Fremont's force, in its present condition, may\r\nnot be quite strong enough in case it comes in collision with the enemy.\r\nFor this additional reason I wish you to push forward your column as\r\nrapidly as possible. Tell me what number your force reaching Front Royal\r\nwill amount to.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 30, 1862. 10.15 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BANKS,\r\n\r\nWilliamsport, Maryland, via Harper's Ferry:\r\n\r\nIf the enemy in force is in or about Martinsburg, Charlestown, and\r\nWinchester, Or any or all of them, he may come in collision with Fremont,\r\nin which case I am anxious that your force, with you and at Harper's\r\nFerry, should so operate as to assist Fremont if possible; the same if\r\nthe enemy should engage McDowell. This was the meaning of my despatch\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 30, 1862. 12.40.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Rectortown:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day received and is satisfactory. Fremont has\r\nnominally 22,000, really about 17,000. Blenker's division is part of it. I\r\nhave a despatch from Fremont this morning, not telling me where he is; but\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\"Scouts and men from Winchester represent Jackson's force variously at\r\n30,000 to 60,000. With him Generals Ewell and Longstreet.\"\r\n\r\nThe high figures erroneous, of course. Do you know where Longstreet is?\r\nCorinth is evacuated and occupied by us.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 30, 1862. 2.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Moorefield, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYours, saying you will reach Strasburg or vicinity at 5 P.M. Saturday, has\r\nbeen received and sent to General McDowell, and he directed to act in view\r\nof it. You must be up to the time you promised, if possible.\r\n\r\nCorinth was evacuated last night, and is occupied by our troops to-day;\r\nthe enemy gone south to Okolotia, on the railroad to Mobile.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON CITY, May 30, 1862.9.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Rectortown, Va.:\r\n\r\nI send you a despatch just received from Saxton at Harper's Ferry: \"The\r\nrebels are in line of battle in front of our lines. They have nine pieces\r\nof artillery, and in position, and cavalry. I shelled the woods in which\r\nthey were, and they in return threw a large number of shells into the\r\nlines and tents from which I moved last night to take up a stronger\r\nposition. I expect a great deal from the battery on the mountain, having\r\nthree 9 inch Dahlgren bearing directly on the enemy's approaches. The\r\nenemy appeared this morning and then retired, with the intention of\r\ndrawing us on. I shall act on the defensive, as my position is a strong\r\none. In a skirmish which took place this afternoon I lost one horse, The\r\nenemy lost two men killed and seven wounded.\r\n\r\n\"R. SAXTON, Brigadier General.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems the game is before you. Have sent a copy to General Fremont.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 31, 1862. 10.20 PM.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nA circle whose circumference shall pass through Harper's Ferry, Front\r\nRoyal, and Strasburg, and whose center shall be a little northeast of\r\nWinchester, almost certainly has within it this morning the forces of\r\nJackson, Ewell, and Edward Johnson. Quite certainly they were within it\r\ntwo days ago. Some part of their forces attacked Harper's Ferry at\r\ndark last evening, and are still in sight this morning. Shields, with\r\nMcDowell's advance, retook Front Royal at 11 A.M. yesterday, with a\r\ndozen of our own prisoners taken there a week ago, 150 of the enemy, two\r\nlocomotives, and eleven cars, some other property and stores, and saved\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont, from the direction of Moorefield, promises to be at or\r\nnear Strasburg at 5 P.M. to-day. General Banks at Williamsport, with his\r\nold force and his new force at Harper's Ferry, is directed to co-operate.\r\nShields at Front Royal reports a rumor of still an additional force of the\r\nenemy, supposed to be Anderson's, having entered the valley of Virginia.\r\nThis last may or may not be true. Corinth is certainly in the hands of\r\nGeneral Halleck.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. A. McCALL, WASHINGTON, May 31, 1562.\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCALL:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to say to you that there can be nothing to\r\njustify a panic at Fredericksburg. He expects you to maintain your\r\nposition there as becomes a soldier and a general.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, D.C., June 1, 1862. 9.30.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYou are probably engaged with the enemy. I suppose he made the attack.\r\nStand well on your guard, hold all your ground, or yield any only inch by\r\ninch and in good order. This morning we merge General Wool's department\r\ninto yours, giving you command of the whole, and sending General Dix to\r\nPort Monroe and General Wool to Fort McHenry. We also send General Sigel\r\nto report to you for duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nWith these continuous rains I am very anxious about the Chickahominy so\r\nclose in your rear and crossing your line of communication. Please look to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 3, 1862. 6.15 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Front Royal, Virginia:\r\n\r\nAnxious to know whether Shields can head or flank Jackson. Please tell\r\nabout where Shields and Jackson, respectively, are at the time this\r\nreaches you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W.

ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nDo you really wish to have control of the question of releasing rebel\r\nprisoners so far as they may be Tennesseeans? If you do, please tell us\r\nso. Your answer not to be made public.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B.

I have just received the following answer from him:\r\n\r\nWe have Fort Pillow, Randolph, and Memphis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W.

In your movement upon Chattanooga I think it\r\nprobable that you include some combination of the force near Cumberland\r\nGap under General Morgan.\r\n\r\nDo you?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BANKS, Winchester:\r\n\r\nWe are arranging a general plan for the valley of the Shenandoah, and in\r\naccordance with this you will move your main force to the Shenandoah at or\r\nopposite Front Royal as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nHalt at Harrisonburg, pursuing Jackson no farther. Get your force well in\r\nhand and stand on the defensive, guarding against a movement of the enemy\r\neither back toward Strasburg or toward Franklin, and await further orders,\r\nwhich will soon be sent you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, 'Tennessee:\r\n\r\nYour despatch about seizing seventy rebels to exchange for a like\r\nnumber of Union men was duly received. I certainly do not disapprove the\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT. WASHINGTON, June 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nAccounts, which we do not credit, represent that Jackson is largely\r\nreinforced and turning upon you. Get your forces well in hand and keep us\r\nwell and frequently advised; and if you find yourself really pressed by a\r\nsuperior force of the enemy, fall back cautiously toward or to Winchester,\r\nand we will have in due time Banks in position to sustain you. Do not\r\nfall back upon Harrisonburg unless upon tolerably clear necessity. We\r\nunderstand Jackson is on the other side of the Shenandoah from you, and\r\nhence cannot in any event press you into any necessity of a precipitate\r\nwithdrawal.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Yours, preferring Mount Jackson to Harrisonburg, is just received.\r\nOn this point use your discretion, remembering that our object is to give\r\nsuch protection as you can to western Virginia. Many thanks to yourself,\r\nofficers, and men for the gallant battle of last Sunday. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJune 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I herewith\r\ntransmit a memorial addressed and presented to me in behalf of the State\r\nof New York in favor of enlarging the locks of the Erie and Oswego Canal.\r\nWhile I have not given nor have leisure to give the subject a careful\r\nexamination, its great importance is obvious and unquestionable. The large\r\namount of valuable statistical information which is collated and presented\r\nin the memorial will greatly facilitate the mature consideration of the\r\nsubject, which I respectfully ask for it at your hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON; June 13. 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to keep your force and Banks's and McDowell's engaged\r\nin keeping Jackson south of Strasburg and Front Royal. You fought Jackson\r\nalone and worsted him. He can have no substantial reinforcements so long\r\nas a battle is pending at Richmond. Surely you and Banks in supporting\r\ndistance are capable of keeping him from returning to Winchester. But if\r\nSigel be sent forward to you, and McDowell (as he must) be put to other\r\nwork, Jackson will break through at Front Royal again. He is already on\r\nthe right side of the Shenandoah to do it, and on the wrong side of it to\r\nattack you. The orders already sent you and Banks place you and him in the\r\nproper positions for the work assigned you. Jackson cannot move his whole\r\nforce on either of you before the other can learn of it and go to his\r\nassistance. He cannot divide his force, sending part against each of you,\r\nbecause he will be too weak for either. Please do as I directed in the\r\norder of the 8th and my despatch of yesterday, the 12th, and neither you\r\nnor Banks will be overwhelmed by Jackson. By proper scout lookouts, and\r\nbeacons of smoke by day and fires by night you can always have timely\r\nnotice of the enemy's approach. I know not as to you, but by some this has\r\nbeen too much neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., June 15, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 12th by Colonel Zagonyi is just received.\r\nIn answer to the principal part of it, I repeat the substance of an order\r\nof the 8th and one or two telegraphic despatches sent you since.\r\n\r\nWe have no definite power of sending reinforcements; so that we are\r\ncompelled rather to consider the proper disposal of the forces we have\r\nthan of those we could wish to have. We may be able to send you some dribs\r\nby degrees, but I do not believe we can do more. As you alone beat Jackson\r\nlast Sunday, I argue that you are stronger than he is to-day, unless he\r\nhas been reinforced; and that he cannot have been materially reinforced,\r\nbecause such reinforcement could only have come from Richmond, and he\r\nis much more likely to go to Richmond than Richmond is to come to him.\r\nNeither is very likely. I think Jackson's game--his assigned work--now is\r\nto magnify the accounts of his numbers and reports of his movements, and\r\nthus by constant alarms keep three or four times as many of our troops\r\naway from Richmond as his own force amounts to. Thus he helps his friends\r\nat Richmond three or four times as much as if he were there. Our game is\r\nnot to allow this. Accordingly, by the order of the 8th, I directed you\r\nto halt at Harrisonburg, rest your force, and get it well in hand, the\r\nobjects being to guard against Jackson's returning by the same route to\r\nthe upper Potomac over which you have just driven him out, and at the same\r\ntime give some protection against a raid into West Virginia.\r\n\r\nAlready I have given you discretion to occupy Mount Jackson instead,\r\nif, on full consideration, you think best. I do not believe Jackson will\r\nattack you, but certainly he cannot attack you by surprise; and if he\r\ncomes upon you in superior force, you have but to notify us, fall back\r\ncautiously, and Banks will join you in due time. But while we know not\r\nwhether Jackson will move at all, or by what route, we cannot safely put\r\nyou and Banks both on the Strasburg line, and leave no force on the Front\r\nRoyal line--the very line upon which he prosecuted his late raid. The true\r\npolicy is to place one of you on one line and the other on the other in\r\nsuch positions that you can unite once you actually find Jackson moving\r\nupon it. And this is precisely what we are doing. This protects that\r\npart of our frontier, so to speak, and liberates McDowell to go to the\r\nassistance of McClellan. I have arranged this, and am very unwilling to\r\nhave it deranged. While you have only asked for Sigel, I have spoken only\r\nof Banks, and this because Sigel's force is now the principal part of\r\nBank's force.\r\n\r\nAbout transferring General Schenck's commands, the purchase of supplies,\r\nand the promotion and appointment of officers, mentioned in your letter, I\r\nwill consult with the Secretary of War to-morrow.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 16, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Mount Jackson, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of yesterday, reminding me of a supposed understanding\r\nthat I would furnish you a corps of 35,000 men, and asking of me the\r\n\"fulfilment of this understanding,\" is received. I am ready to come to a\r\nfair settlement of accounts with you on the fulfilment of understandings.\r\n\r\nEarly in March last, when I assigned you to the command of the Mountain\r\nDepartment, I did tell you I would give you all the force I could, and\r\nthat I hoped to make it reach 35,000. You at the same time told me that\r\nwithin a reasonable time you would seize the railroad at or east of\r\nKnoxville, Tenn., if you could. There was then in the department a force\r\nsupposed to be 25,000, the exact number as well known to you as to me.\r\nAfter looking about two or three days, you called and distinctly told\r\nme that if I would add the Blenker division to the force already in the\r\ndepartment, you would undertake the job. The Blenker division contained\r\n10,000, and at the expense of great dissatisfaction to General McClellan\r\nI took it from his army and gave it to you. My promise was literally\r\nfulfilled. I have given you all I could, and I have given you very nearly,\r\nif not quite, 35,000.\r\n\r\nNow for yours. On the 23d of May, largely over two months afterward, you\r\nwere at Franklin, Va., not within 300 miles of Knoxville, nor within 80\r\nmiles of any part of the railroad east of it, and not moving forward, but\r\ntelegraphing here that you could not move for lack of everything. Now,\r\ndo not misunderstand me. I do not say you have not done all you could. I\r\npresume you met unexpected difficulties; and I beg you to believe that as\r\nsurely as you have done your best, so have I. I have not the power now to\r\nfill up your Corps to 35,000. I am not demanding of you to do the work of\r\n35,000. I am only asking of you to stand cautiously on the defensive, get\r\nyour force in order, and give such protection as you can to the valley of\r\nthe Shenandoah and to western Virginia.\r\n\r\nHave you received the orders, and will you act upon them?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL C. SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 16, 1862\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL SCHURZ, Mount Jackson, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour long letter is received. The information you give is valuable. You\r\nsay it is fortunate that Fremont did not intercept Jackson; that Jackson\r\nhad the superior force, and would have overwhelmed him. If this is so, how\r\nhappened it that Fremont fairly fought and routed him on the 8th? Or is\r\nthe account that he did fight and rout him false and fabricated? Both\r\nGeneral Fremont and you speak of Jackson having beaten Shields. By our\r\naccounts he did not beat Shields. He had no engagement with Shields. He\r\ndid meet and drive back with disaster about 2000 of Shields's advance till\r\nthey were met by an additional brigade of Shields's, when Jackson himself\r\nturned and retreated. Shields himself and more than half his force were\r\nnot nearer than twenty miles to any of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 18, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nIt would be of both interest and value to us here to know how the\r\nexpedition toward East Tennessee is progressing, if in your judgment you\r\ncan give us the information with safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 18, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day, making it probable that Jackson has been reinforced by\r\nabout 10,000 from Richmond, is corroborated by a despatch from General\r\nKing at Fredericksburg, saying a Frenchman, just arrived from Richmond by\r\nway of Gordonsville, met 10,000 to 15,000 passing through the latter place\r\nto join Jackson.\r\n\r\nIf this is true, it is as good as a reinforcement to you of an equal\r\nforce. I could better dispose of things if I could know about what day you\r\ncan attack Richmond, and would be glad to be informed, if you think you\r\ncan inform me with safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JUNE 19, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours of last night just received, and for which I thank you.\r\n\r\nIf large reinforcements are going from Richmond to Jackson, it proves one\r\nof two things: either they are very strong at Richmond, or do not mean to\r\ndefend the place desperately.\r\n\r\nOn reflection, I do not see how reinforcements from Richmond to Jackson\r\ncould be in Gordonsville, as reported by the Frenchman and your deserters.\r\nHave not all been sent to deceive?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, June 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nIn regard to the contemplated execution of Captains Spriggs and Triplett\r\nthe government has no information whatever, but will inquire and advise\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, June 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nWe have this morning sent you a despatch of General Sigel corroborative of\r\nthe proposition that Jackson is being reinforced from Richmond. This\r\nmay be reality, and yet may only be contrivance for deception, and to\r\ndetermine which is perplexing. If we knew it was not true, we could send\r\nyou some more force; but as the case stands we do not think we safely can.\r\nStill, we will watch the signs and do so if possible.\r\n\r\nIn regard to a contemplated execution of Captains Spriggs and Triplett the\r\ngovernment has no information whatever, but will inquire and advise you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 21 1862 6 PM.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of yesterday (2 P. M.) was received this morning. If it\r\nwould not divert too much of your time and attention from the army under\r\nyour immediate command, I would be glad to have your views as to the\r\npresent state of military affairs throughout the whole country, as you say\r\nyou would be glad to give them. I would rather it should be by letter than\r\nby telegraph, because of the better chance of secrecy. As to the numbers\r\nand positions of the troops not under your command in Virginia and\r\nelsewhere, even if I could do it with accuracy, which I cannot, I would\r\nrather not transmit either by telegraph or by letter, because of the\r\nchances of its reaching the enemy. I would be very glad to talk with you,\r\nbut you cannot leave your camp, and I cannot well leave here.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June 22, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BANKS, Middletown:\r\n\r\nI am very glad you are looking well to the west for a movement of the\r\nenemy in that direction. You know my anxiety on that point.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet at General McClellan's headquarters at two o'clock to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY WITH MEXICO\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 23, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of December, 1861, I submitted to the Senate the project of\r\na treaty between the United States and Mexico which had been proposed to\r\nme by Mr. Corwin, our minister to Mexico, and respectfully requested the\r\nadvice of the Senate thereupon.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th day of February last a resolution was adopted by the Senate to\r\nthe effect:\r\n\r\n\"That it is not advisable to negotiate a treaty that will require the\r\nUnited States to assume any portion of the principal or interest of the\r\ndebt of Mexico, or that will require the concurrence of European powers.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution having been duly communicated to me, notice thereof was\r\nimmediately given by the Secretary of State to Mr. Corwin, and he was\r\ninformed that he was to consider his instructions upon the subject\r\nreferred to modified by this resolution and would govern his course\r\naccordingly. That despatch failed to reach Mr. Corwin, by reason of the\r\ndisturbed condition of Mexico, until a very recent date, Mr. Corwin being\r\nwithout instructions, or thus practically left without instructions, to\r\nnegotiate further with Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn view of the very important events Occurring there, he has thought that\r\nthe interests of the United States would be promoted by the conclusion\r\nof two treaties which should provide for a loan to that republic. He has\r\ntherefore signed such treaties, and they having been duly ratified by the\r\nGovernment of Mexico, he has transmitted them to me for my consideration.\r\nThe action of the Senate is of course conclusive against an acceptance\r\nof the treaties On my part. I have, nevertheless, thought it just to our\r\nexcellent minister in Mexico and respectful to the Government of that\r\nrepublic to lay the treaties before the Senate, together with the\r\ncorrespondence which has occurred in relation to them. In performing this\r\nduty I have only to add that the importance of the subject thus submitted\r\nto the Senate, can not be over estimated, and I shall cheerfully receive\r\nand consider with the highest respect any further advice the Senate may\r\nthink proper to give upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO OF A CURRENCY BILL\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE, JUNE 23, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe bill which has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate,\r\nentitled \"An act to repeal that part of an act of Congress which prohibits\r\nthe circulation of bank-notes of a less denomination than five dollars in\r\nthe District of Columbia,\" has received my attentive consideration, and\r\nI now return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with the following\r\nobjections:\r\n\r\n1. The bill proposes to repeal the existing legislation prohibiting the\r\ncirculation of bank-notes of a less denomination than five dollars within\r\nthe District of Columbia, without permitting the issuing of such bills by\r\nbanks not now legally authorized to issue them. In my judgment, it will\r\nbe found impracticable, in the present condition of the currency, to make\r\nsuch a discrimination. The banks have generally suspended specie payments,\r\nand a legal sanction given to the circulation of the irredeemable notes\r\nof one class of them will almost certainly be so extended, in practical\r\noperation, as to include those of all classes, whether authorized or\r\nunauthorized. If this view be correct, the currency of the District,\r\nshould this act become a law, will certainly and greatly deteriorate, to\r\nthe serious injury of honest trade and honest labor.\r\n\r\n2. This bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be otherwise\r\nmore certainly and beneficially attained. During the existing war it is\r\npeculiarly the duty of the National Government to secure to the people\r\na sound circulating medium. This duty has been, under existing\r\ncircumstances, satisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing\r\nthe issue of United States notes, receivable for all government dues\r\nexcept customs, and made a legal tender for all debts, public and private,\r\nexcept interest on public debt. The object of the bill submitted to\r\nme--namely, that of providing a small note currency during the present\r\nsuspension--can be fully accomplished by authorizing the issue, as part\r\nof any new emission of United States notes made necessary by the\r\ncircumstances of the country, of notes of a similar character, but of\r\nless denomination than five dollars. Such an issue would answer all the\r\nbeneficial purposes of the bill, would save a considerable amount to the\r\ntreasury in interest, would greatly facilitate payments to soldiers and\r\nother creditors of small sums, and would furnish; to the people a currency\r\nas safe as their own government.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these objections to the bill, I feel myself constrained to\r\nwithhold from it my approval and return it for the further consideration\r\nand action of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT JERSEY CITY, JUNE 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nWhen birds and animals are looked at through a fog, they are seen to\r\ndisadvantage, and so it might be with you if I were to attempt to tell\r\nyou why I went to see General Scott. I can only say that my visit to West\r\nPoint did not have the importance which has been attached to it; but it\r\nconcerned matters that you understand quite as well as if I were to tell\r\nyou all about them. Now, I can only remark that it had nothing whatever\r\nto do with making or unmaking any general in the country. The Secretary of\r\nWar, you know, holds a pretty tight rein on the press, so that they shall\r\nnot tell more than they ought to; and I 'm afraid that if I blab too much,\r\nhe might draw a tight rein on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour three despatches of yesterday in relation to the affair, ending with\r\nthe statement that you completely succeeded in making your point, are very\r\ngratifying.\r\n\r\nThe later one of 6.15 P.M., suggesting the probability of your\r\nbeing overwhelmed by two hundred thousand, and talking of where the\r\nresponsibility will belong, pains me very much. I give you all I can, and\r\nact on the presumption that you will do the best you can with what you\r\nhave, while you continue, ungenerously I think, to assume that I could\r\ngive you more if I would. I have omitted, and shall omit, no opportunity\r\nto send you reinforcements whenever I possibly can.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S. General Pope thinks if you fall back it would be much better towards\r\nYork River than towards the James. As Pope now has charge of the capital,\r\nplease confer with him through the telegraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONSTITUTING THE ARMY OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered: 1st. The forces under Major-Generals Fremont, Banks, and\r\nMcDowell, including the troops now under Brigadier-General Sturgis at\r\nWashington, shall be consolidated and form one army, to be called the Army\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\n2d. The command of the Army of Virginia is specially assigned to\r\nMajor-General John Pope, as commanding general. The troops of the Mountain\r\nDepartment, heretofore under command of General Fremont, shall constitute\r\nthe First Army Corps, under the command of General Fremont; the troops of\r\nthe Shenandoah Department, now under General Banks, shall constitute the\r\nSecond Army Corps, and be commanded by him; the troops under the command\r\nof General McDowell, except those within the fortifications and city of\r\nWashington, shall form the Third Army Corps, and be under his command.\r\n\r\n3d. The Army of Virginia shall operate in such manner as, while protecting\r\nwestern Virginia and the national capital from danger or insult, it shall\r\nin the speediest manner attack and overcome the rebel forces under Jackson\r\nand Ewell, threaten the enemy in the direction of Charlottesville, and\r\nrender the most effective aid to relieve General McClellan and capture\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n4th. When the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Virginia shall be in\r\nposition to communicate and directly co-operate at or before Richmond, the\r\nchief command, while so operating together, shall be governed, as in like\r\ncases, by the Rules and Articles of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nThe enemy have concentrated in such force at Richmond as to render it\r\nabsolutely necessary, in the opinion of the President, for you immediately\r\nto detach 25,000 of your force and forward it by the nearest and quickest\r\nroute by way of Baltimore and Washington to Richmond. It is believed\r\nthat the quickest route would be by way of Columbus, Ky., and up the Ohio\r\nRiver. But in detaching your force the President directs that it be done\r\nin such a way as to enable you to hold your ground and not interfere with\r\nthe movement against Chattanooga and East Tennessee. This condition being\r\nobserved, the forces to be detached and the routes they are to be sent are\r\nleft to your own judgment.\r\n\r\nThe direction to send these forces immediately is rendered imperative by\r\na serious reverse suffered by General McClellan before Richmond yesterday,\r\nthe full extent of which is not yet known.\r\n\r\nYou will acknowledge the receipt of this despatch, stating the day and\r\nhour it is received, and inform me what your action will be, so that we\r\nmay take measures to aid in river and railroad transportation.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAMS TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BURNSIDE:\r\n\r\nI think you had better go, with any reinforcements you can spare, to\r\nGeneral McClellan.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June, 28, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Newbern:\r\n\r\nWe have intelligence that General McClellan has been attacked in large\r\nforce and compelled to fall back toward the James River. We are not\r\nadvised of his exact condition, but the President directs that you shall\r\nsend him all the reinforcements from your command to the James River that\r\nyou can safely do without abandoning your own position. Let it be infantry\r\nentirely, as he said yesterday that he had cavalry enough.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, June 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nSave your army, at all events. Will send reinforcements as fast as we can.\r\nOf course they cannot reach you to-day, to-morrow, or next day. I have not\r\nsaid you were ungenerous for saying you needed reinforcements. I thought\r\nyou were ungenerous in assuming that I did not send them as fast as I\r\ncould. I feel any misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you\r\nfeel it yourself. If you have had a drawn battle, or a repulse, it is\r\nthe price we pay for the enemy not being in Washington. We protected\r\nWashington, and the enemy concentrated on you. Had we stripped Washington,\r\nhe would have been upon us before the troops could have gotten to you.\r\nLess than a week ago you notified us that reinforcements were leaving\r\nRichmond to come in front of us. It is the nature of the case, and neither\r\nyou nor the government is to blame. Please tell at once the present\r\ncondition and aspect of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, June 28, 1862\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--My view of the present condition of the war is about as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe evacuation of Corinth and our delay by the flood in the Chickahominy\r\nhave enabled the enemy to concentrate too much force in Richmond\r\nfor McClellan to successfully attack. In fact there soon will be no\r\nsubstantial rebel force anywhere else. But if we send all the force from\r\nhere to McClellan, the enemy will, before we can know of it, send a force\r\nfrom Richmond and take Washington. Or if a large part of the western army\r\nbe brought here to McClellan, they will let us have Richmond, and retake\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, etc. What should be done is to hold what\r\nwe have in the West, open the Mississippi, and take Chattanooga and East\r\nTennessee without more. A reasonable force should in every event be\r\nkept about Washington for its protection. Then let the country give us a\r\nhundred thousand new troops in the shortest possible time, which, added to\r\nMcClellan directly or indirectly, will take Richmond without endangering\r\nany other place which we now hold, and will substantially end the war.\r\nI expect to maintain this contest until successful, or till I die, or am\r\nconquered, or my term expires, or Congress or the country forsake me; and\r\nI would publicly appeal to the country for this new force were it not that\r\nI fear a general panic and stampede would follow, so hard it is to have a\r\nthing understood as it really is. I think the new force should be all, or\r\nnearly all, infantry, principally because such can be raised most cheaply\r\nand quickly.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., June 28,1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIX:\r\n\r\nCommunication with McClellan by White House is cut off. Strain every nerve\r\nto open communication with him by James River, or any other way you can.\r\nReport to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO FLAG-OFFICER L. M. GOLDSBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., June 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nFLAG-OFFICER GOLDS BOROUGH, Fort Monroe:\r\n\r\nEnemy has cut McClellan's communication with White House, and is driving\r\nStoneman back on that point. Do what you can for him with gunboats at or\r\nnear that place. McClellan's main force is between the Chickahominy and\r\nthe James. Also do what you can to communicate with him and support him\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo GOVERNOR MORTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C. June 28, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR O. P. MORTON, Indianapolis, Ind:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day is just received. I have no recollection of either\r\nJohn R. Cravens or Cyrus M. Allen having been named to me for appointment\r\nunder the tax law. The latter particularly has been my friend, and I am\r\nsorry to learn that he is not yours. No appointment has been or will be\r\nmade by me for the purpose of stabbing you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June 29, 1862.6 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Astor House, New York:\r\n\r\nNot much more than when you left. Fulton of Baltimore American is now with\r\nus. He left White House at 11 A.M. yesterday. He conversed fully with a\r\npaymaster who was with Porter's force during the fight of Friday and fell\r\nback to nearer McClellan's quarters just a little sooner than Porter did,\r\nseeing the whole of it; stayed on the Richmond side of the Chickahominy\r\nover night, and left for White House at 5 A.M. Saturday. He says Porter\r\nretired in perfect order under protection of the guns arranged for the\r\npurpose, under orders and not from necessity; and with all other of our\r\nforces, except what was left on purpose to go to White House, was safely\r\nin pontoons over the Chickahominy before morning, and that there was heavy\r\nfiring on the Richmond side, begun at 5 and ceased at 7 A.M. Saturday. On\r\nthe whole, I think we have had the better of it up to that point of time.\r\nWhat has happened since we still know not, as we have no communication\r\nwith General McClellan. A despatch from Colonel Ingalls shows that he\r\nthinks McClellan is fighting with the enemy at Richmond to-day, and will\r\nbe to-morrow. We have no means of knowing upon what Colonel Ingalls founds\r\nhis opinion. Confirmed about saving all property. Not a single unwounded\r\nstraggler came back to White House from the field, and the number of\r\nwounded reaching there up to 11 A.M. Saturday was not large.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what the President has above stated I will only add one or two points\r\nthat may be satisfactory for you to know.\r\n\r\nFirst. All the sick and wounded were safely removed\r\n\r\nSecond. A despatch from Burnside shows that he is from White House; not a\r\nman left behind in condition to afford efficient support, and is probably\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nThird. The despatch from Colonel Ingalls impresses me with the conviction\r\nthat the movement was made by General McClellan to concentrate on\r\nRichmond, and was successful to the latest point of which we have any\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nFourth. Mr. Fulton says that on Friday night, between twelve and one\r\no'clock, General McClellan telegraphed Commodore Goldsborough that the\r\nresult of the movement was satisfactory to him.\r\n\r\nFifth. From these and the facts stated by the President, my inference is\r\nthat General McClellan will probably be in Richmond within two days.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n[Unfortunately McClellan did not do any of the things he was ordered, and\r\nthat it was very likely possible to do. It is still some mystery what he\r\nwas doing all these days other than hiding in the woods and staying out of\r\ncommunication so he would not receive any more uncomfortable orders. This\r\nwas another place where the North was close to wining the war and did not.\r\nD.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD. WAR DEPARTMENT, June 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. WM. H. SEWARD, New York:\r\n\r\nWe are yet without communication with General McClellan, and this absence\r\nof news is our point of anxiety. Up to the latest point to which we are\r\nposted he effected everything in such exact accordance with his plan,\r\ncontingently announced to us before the battle began, that we feel\r\njustified to hope that he has not failed since. He had a severe engagement\r\nin getting the part of his army on this side of the Chickahominy over to\r\nthe other side, in which the enemy lost certainly as much as we did. We\r\nare not dissatisfied with this, only that the loss of enemies does not\r\ncompensate for the loss of friends. The enemy cannot come below White\r\nHouse; certainly is not there now, and probably has abandoned the whole\r\nline. Dix's pickets are at New Kent Court-House.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALL FOR TROOPS. NEW YORK, June 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNORS OF THE SEVERAL STATES:\r\n\r\nThe capture of New Orleans, Norfolk, and Corinth by the national forces\r\nhas enabled the insurgents to concentrate a large force at and about\r\nRichmond, which place we must take with the least possible delay; in fact,\r\nthere will soon be no formidable insurgent force except at Richmond.\r\nWith so large an army there, the enemy can threaten us on the Potomac and\r\nelsewhere. Until we have re-established the national authority, all these\r\nplaces must be held, and we must keep a respectable force in front of\r\nWASHINGTON. But this, from the diminished strength of our army by sickness\r\nand casualties, renders an addition to it necessary in order to close the\r\nstruggle which has been prosecuted for the last three months with energy\r\nand success. Rather than hazard the misapprehension of our military\r\ncondition and of groundless alarm by a call for troops by proclamation, I\r\nhave deemed it best to address you in this form. To accomplish the object\r\nstated we require without delay 150,000 men, including those recently\r\ncalled for by the Secretary of War. Thus reinforced our gallant army will\r\nbe enabled to realize the hopes and expectations of the government and the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, June 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe:\r\n\r\nIs it not probable that the enemy has abandoned the line between White\r\nHouse and McClellan's rear? He could have but little object to maintain\r\nit, and nothing to subsist upon. Would not Stoneman better move up and\r\nsee about it? I think a telegraphic communication can at once be opened to\r\nWhite House from Williamsburg. The wires must be up still.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAMS TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, JUNE 30, 1862. 3 P. M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth:\r\n\r\nYour telegram of this date just received. The Chattanooga expedition\r\nmust not on any account be given up. The President regards that and the\r\nmovement against East Tennessee as one of the most important movements\r\nof the war, and its occupation nearly as important as the capture of\r\nRichmond. He is not pleased with the tardiness of the movement toward\r\nChattanooga, and directs that no force be sent here if you cannot do it\r\nwithout breaking up the operations against that point and East Tennessee.\r\nInfantry only are needed; our cavalry and artillery are strong enough.\r\nThe first reports from Richmond were more discouraging than the truth\r\nwarranted. If the advantage is not on our side, it is balanced. General\r\nMcClellan has moved his whole force on the line of the James River, and\r\nis supported there by our gunboats; but he must be largely strengthened\r\nbefore advancing, and hence the call on you, which I am glad you answered\r\nso promptly. Let me know to what point on the river you will send your\r\nforces, so as to provide immediately for transportation.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., June 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nWould be very glad of 25,000 infantry; no artillery or cavalry; but please\r\ndo not send a man if it endangers any place you deem important to hold,\r\nor if it forces you to give up or weaken or delay the expedition against\r\nChattanooga. To take and hold the railroad at or east of Cleveland, in\r\nEast Tennessee, I think fully as important as the taking and holding of\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALL FOR 300,000 VOLUNTEERS, JULY 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nJune 28, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, governors of States of the Union, impressed with the\r\nbelief that the citizens of the States which they respectively represent\r\nare of one accord in the hearty desire that the recent successes of the\r\nFederal arms may be followed up by measures which must insure the speedy\r\nrestoration of the Union, and believing that, in view of the present\r\nstate of the important military movements now in progress, and the reduced\r\ncondition of our effective forces in the field, resulting from the usual\r\nand unavoidable casualties in the service, the time has arrived for prompt\r\nand vigorous measures to be adopted by the people in support of the great\r\ninterests committed to your charge, respectfully request, if it meets with\r\nyour entire approval, that you at once call upon the several States\r\nfor such number of men as may be required to fill up all military\r\norganizations now in the field, and add to the armies heretofore organized\r\nsuch additional number of men as may, in your judgment, be necessary to\r\ngarrison and hold all the numerous cities and military positions that\r\nhave been captured by our armies, and to speedily crush the rebellion that\r\nstill exists in several of the Southern States, thus practically restoring\r\nto the civilized world our great and good government. All believe that the\r\ndecisive moment is near at hand, and to that end the people of the United\r\nStates are desirous to aid promptly in furnishing all reinforcements that\r\nyou may deem needful to sustain our government.\r\n\r\n     ISRAEL WASHBURN, JR., Governor of Maine.\r\n     H. S. BERRY, Governor of New Hampshire.\r\n     FREDERICK HOLBROOK, Governor of Vermont.\r\n     WILLIAM A. BUCKINGHAM, Governor of Connecticut.\r\n     E. D.

I suggest and recommend that the troops should be chiefly\r\nof infantry. The quota of your State would be ------. I trust that\r\nthey may be enrolled without delay, so as to bring this unnecessary and\r\ninjurious civil war to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion. An order\r\nfixing the quotas of the respective States will be issued by the War\r\nDepartment to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING TAXES IN REBELLIOUS STATES, JULY 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas in and by the second section of an act of Congress passed on the\r\n7th day of June, A. D. 1862, entitled \"An act for the collection of direct\r\ntaxes in insurrectionary districts within the United States, and for other\r\npurposes,\" it is made the duty of the President to declare, on or before\r\nthe first day of July then next following, by his proclamation, in what\r\nStates and parts of States insurrection exists:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that the\r\nStates of South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas,\r\nMississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and the State of\r\nVirginia except the following counties-Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, Marshall,\r\nWetzel, Marion, Monongalia, Preston, Taylor, Pleasants, Tyler, Ritchie,\r\nDoddridge, Harrison, Wood, Jackson, Wirt, Roane, Calhoun, Gilmer, Barbour,\r\nTucker, Lewis, Braxton, Upsbur, Randolph, Mason, Putnam, Kanawha, Clay,\r\nNicholas, Cabell, Wayne, Boone, Logan, Wyoming, Webster, Fayette, and\r\nRaleigh-are now in insurrection and rebellion, and by reason thereof the\r\ncivil authority of the United States is obstructed so that the provisions\r\nof the \"Act to provide increased revenue from imports, to pay the interest\r\non the public debt, and for other purposes,\" approved August 5, 1861, can\r\nnot be peaceably executed; and that the taxes legally chargeable upon real\r\nestate under the act last aforesaid lying within the States and parts\r\nof States as aforesaid, together with a penalty of 50 per centum of said\r\ntaxes, shall be a lien upon the tracts or lots of the same, severally\r\ncharged, till paid.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed..............\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  F. W. SEWARD, Acting Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS, JULY 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nI most cordially recommend that Captain Andrew H. Foote, of the United\r\nStates Navy, receive a vote of thanks of Congress for his eminent services\r\nin Organizing the flotilla on the western Waters, and for his gallantry at\r\nFort Henry, Fort Donelson, Island Number Ten, and at various other places,\r\nwhilst in command of the naval forces, embracing a period of nearly ten\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C. July 1, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JULY 1,1862. 3.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to reinforce you for your present emergency. If we had a\r\nmillion of men, We could not get them to you in time. We have not the men\r\nto send. If you are not strong enough to face the enemy, you must find a\r\nplace of security, and wait, rest, and repair. Maintain your ground if\r\nyou can, but save the army at all events, even if you fall back to Fort\r\nMonroe. We still have strength enough in the country, and will bring it\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., July 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of Tuesday morning induces me to hope your army is having\r\nsome rest. In this hope allow me to reason with you a moment. When you ask\r\nfor 50,000 men to be promptly sent you, you surely labor under some gross\r\nmistake of fact. Recently you sent papers showing your disposal of forces\r\nmade last spring for the defense of WASHINGTON, and advising a return to\r\nthat plan. I find it included in and about WASHINGTON 75,000 men. Now,\r\nplease be assured I have not men enough to fill that very plan by 15,000.\r\nAll of Fremont's in the valley, all of Banks's, all of McDowell's not with\r\nyou, and all in WASHINGTON, taken together, do not exceed, if they reach,\r\n60,000. With Wool and Dix added to those mentioned, I have not, outside of\r\nyour army, 75,000 men east of the mountains. Thus the idea of sending you\r\n50,000, or any other considerable force, promptly, is simply absurd. If,\r\nin your frequent mention of responsibility, you have the impression that\r\nI blame you for not doing more than you can, please be relieved of\r\nsuch impression. I only beg that in like manner you will not ask\r\nimpossibilities of me. If you think you are not strong enough to take\r\nRichmond just now, I do not ask you to try just now. Save the army,\r\nmaterial and personal, and I will strengthen it for the offensive again\r\nas fast as I can. The governors of eighteen States offer me a new levy of\r\n300,000, which I accept.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C. July 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nYour several despatches of yesterday to Secretary of War and myself\r\nreceived. I did say, and now repeat, I would be exceedingly glad for some\r\nreinforcements from you. Still do not send a man if in your judgment it\r\nwill endanger any point you deem important to hold, or will force you to\r\ngive up or weaken or delay the Chattanooga expedition.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me could you not make me a flying visit for consultation\r\nwithout endangering the Service in your department.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, July 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nI herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, an\r\nact entitled \"An act to provide for additional medical officers of the\r\nvolunteer service,\" without my approval.\r\n\r\nMy reason for so doing is that I have approved an act of the same title\r\npassed by Congress after the passage of the one first mentioned for the\r\nexpress purpose of correcting errors in and superseding the same, as I am\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR LETTER TO THE GOVERNORS.\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential.)\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 3, 1862.10.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR WASHBURN, Maine [and other governors] I should not want the half\r\nof 300,000 new troops if I could have them now. If I had 50,000 additional\r\ntroops here now, I believe I could substantially close the war in two\r\nweeks. But time is everything, and if I get 50,000 new men in a month, I\r\nshall have lost 20,000 old ones during the same month, having gained only\r\n30,000, with the difference between old and new troops still against me.\r\nThe quicker you send, the fewer you will have to send. Time is everything.\r\nPlease act in view of this. The enemy having given up Corinth, it is not\r\nwonderful that he is thereby enabled to check us for a time at Richmond.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D.C., JULY 3, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours of 5.30 yesterday is just received. I am satisfied that yourself,\r\nofficers, and men have done the best you could. All accounts say better\r\nfighting was never done. Ten thousand thanks for it.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th we sent General Burnside an order to send all the force he\r\ncould spare to you. We then learned that you had requested him to go to\r\nGoldsborough; upon which we said to him our order was intended for your\r\nbenefit, and we did not wish to be in conflict with your views.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will have help from him soon. Today we have ordered General\r\nHunter to send you all he can spare. At last advices General Halleck\r\nthinks he cannot send reinforcements without endangering all he has\r\ngained.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., July 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI understand your position as stated in your letter and by General Marcy.\r\nTo reinforce you so as to enable you to resume the offensive within a\r\nmonth, or even six weeks, is impossible. In addition to that arrived and\r\nnow arriving from the Potomac (about 10,000 men, I suppose), and about\r\n10,000 I hope you will have from Burnside very soon, and about 5000 from\r\nHunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you another man within\r\na month. Under these circumstances the defensive for the present must be\r\nyour only care. Save the army first, where you are, if you can; secondly,\r\nby removal, if you must. You, on the ground, must be the judge as to which\r\nyou will attempt, and of the means for effecting it. I but give it as my\r\nopinion that with the aid of the gunboats and the reinforcements mentioned\r\nabove you can hold your present position--provided, and so long as,\r\nyou can keep the James River open below you. If you are not tolerably\r\nconfident you can keep the James River open, you had better remove as soon\r\nas possible. I do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as\r\nto the danger of having your communication cut on the river below you, yet\r\nI do not suppose it can have escaped your attention.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If at any time you feel able to take the offensive, you are not\r\nrestrained from doing so. A.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nYou do not know how much you would oblige us if, without abandoning any of\r\nyour positions or plans, you could promptly send us even 10,000 infantry.\r\nCan you not? Some part of the Corinth army is certainly fighting McClellan\r\nin front of Richmond. Prisoners are in our hands from the late Corinth\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

DIX.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, July 4,1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe:\r\n\r\nSend forward the despatch to Colonel Hawkins and this also. Our order and\r\nGeneral McClellan's to General Burnside being the same, of course we wish\r\nit executed as promptly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B.

Be assured the heroism and skill of yourself and\r\nofficers and men is, and forever will be, appreciated.\r\n\r\nIf you can hold your present position, we shall have the enemy yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., July 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--This introduces Governor William Sprague, of Rhode Island.\r\nHe is now Governor for the third time, and senator-elect of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI know the object of his visit to you. He has my cheerful consent to go,\r\nbut not my direction. He wishes to get you and part of your force, one or\r\nboth, to come here. You already know I should be exceedingly glad of\r\nthis if, in your judgment, it could be without endangering positions and\r\noperations in the southwest; and I now repeat what I have more than once\r\nsaid by telegraph: \"Do not come or send a man if, in your judgment, it\r\nwill endanger any point you deem important to hold, or endangers or delays\r\nthe Chattanooga expedition.\"\r\n\r\nStill, please give my friend, Governor Sprague, a full and fair hearing.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nAND OTHER OFFICERS DURING A VISIT TO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC AT HARRISON'S\r\nLANDING, VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nJuly 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: What amount of force have you now?\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: About 80,000, can't vary much, certainly 75,000.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:[to the corps commanders] What is the whole amount of your\r\ncorps with you now.\r\n\r\n     GENERAL SUMNER: About 15,000.\r\n     GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: 15,000 for duty.\r\n     GENERAL KEYES: About 12,500.\r\n     GENERAL PORTER: About 23,000--fully 20,000 fit for duty.\r\n     GENERAL FRANKLIN: About 15,000.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: What is likely to be your condition as to health in this\r\ncamp?\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: Better than in any encampment since landing at Fortress\r\nMonroe.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN:[to the corps commanders] In your present encampment\r\nwhat is the present and prospective condition as to health?\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUMNER: As good as any part of Western Virginia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Excellent for health, and present health improving.\r\n\r\nGENERAL KEYES: A little improved, but think camp is getting worse.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PORTER: Very good.\r\n\r\nGENERAL FRANKLIN: Not good.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Where is the enemy now?\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: From four to five miles from us on all the roads--I\r\nthink nearly the whole army--both Hills, Longstreet, Jackson, Magruder,\r\nHuger.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] Where and in what condition do\r\nyou believe the enemy to be now?\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUMNER: I think they have retired from our front; were very\r\nmuch damaged, especially in their best troops, in the late actions, from\r\nsuperiority of arms.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Don't think they are in force in our vicinity.\r\n\r\nGENERAL KEYES: Think he has withdrawn, and think preparing to go to\r\nWASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PORTER: Believe he is mainly near Richmond. He feels he dare not\r\nattack us here.\r\n\r\nGENERAL FRANKLIN: I learn he has withdrawn from our front and think that\r\nis probable.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] What is the aggregate of your\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing from the attack on the 26th ultimo till now?\r\n\r\n     GENERAL SUMNER:   1175.\r\n     GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Not large 745.\r\n     GENERAL KEYES: Less than 500.\r\n     GENERAL PORTER:    Over 5000.\r\n     GENERAL FRANKLIN: Not over 3000.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: If you desired could you remove the army safely?\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: It would be a delicate and very difficult matter.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] If it were desired to get the\r\narmy away, could it be safely effected?\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUMNER: I think we could, but I think we give up the cause if we\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Perhaps we could, but I think it would be ruinous to\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nGENERAL KEYES: I think it could if done quickly.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PORTER: Impossible--move the army and ruin the country.\r\n\r\nGENERAL FRANKLIN: I think we could, and that we had better--think\r\nRappahannock the true line.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] Is the army secure in its present\r\nposition?\r\n\r\n    GENERAL SUMNER: Perfectly so, in my judgment.\r\n    GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: I think it is safe.\r\n    GENERAL KEYES: With help of General B. [Burnside] can hold position.\r\n    GENERAL PORTER: Perfectly so. Not only, but we are ready to begin\r\n                    moving forward.\r\n    GENERAL FRANKLIN: Unless river can be closed it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER MAKING HALLECK GENERAL-IN-CHIEF.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 11,1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That Major-General Henry W. Halleck be assigned to command the\r\nwhole land forces of the United States, as general-in-chief, and that he\r\nrepair to this capital so soon as he can with safety to the positions and\r\noperations within the department now under his charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE SOUTHWEST BRANCH OF THE PACIFIC RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nWhereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require\r\nthat the railroad line called and known as the Southwest Branch of the\r\nPacific Railroad in the State of Missouri be repaired, extended, and\r\ncompleted from Rolla to Lebanon, in the direction to Springfield, in the\r\nsaid State, the same being necessary to the successful and economical\r\nconduct of the war and to the maintenance of the authority of the\r\ngovernment in the Southwest:\r\n\r\nTherefore, under and in virtue of the act of Congress entitled \"An act\r\nto authorize the President of the United States in certain cases to take\r\npossession of railroad and telegraph lines, and for other purposes,\"\r\napproved January 31, 1862, it is ordered, That the portion of the said\r\nrailroad line which reaches from Rolla to Lebanon be repaired, extended,\r\nand completed, so as to be made available for the military uses of the\r\ngovernment, as speedily as may be. And, inasmuch as upon the part of the\r\nsaid line from Rolla to the stream called Little Piney a considerable\r\nportion of the necessary work has already been done by the railroad\r\ncompany, and the road to this extent may be completed at comparatively\r\nsmall cost, it is ordered that the said line from Rolla to and across\r\nLittle Piney be first completed, and as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War is charged with the execution of this order. And\r\nto facilitate the speedy execution of the work, he is directed, at his\r\ndiscretion, to take possession and control of the whole or such part of\r\nthe said railroad line, and the whole or such part of the rolling stock,\r\noffices, shops, buildings, and all their appendages and appurtenances, as\r\nhe may judge necessary or convenient for the early completion of the road\r\nfrom Rolla to Lebanon.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of WASHINGTON, July 11, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D C., July 11, 1862\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI recommend that the thanks of Congress be given to the following officers\r\nof the United States Navy:\r\n\r\nCaptain James L. Lardner, for meritorious conduct at the battle of Port\r\nRoyal and distinguished services on the coast of the United States against\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nCaptain Charles Henry Davis, for distinguished services in conflict with\r\nthe enemy at Fort Pillow, at Memphis, and for successful operations at\r\nother points in the waters of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nCommander John A. Dahlgren, for distinguished services in the line of his\r\nprofession, improvements in ordnance, and zealous and efficient labors in\r\nthe ordnance branch of the service.\r\n\r\nCommander Stephen C. Rowan, for distinguished services in the waters of\r\nNorth Carolina, and particularly in the capture of Newbern, being in chief\r\ncommand of the naval forces.\r\n\r\nCommander David D. Porter, for distinguished services in the conception\r\nand preparation of the means used for the capture of the forts below\r\nNew Orleans, and for highly meritorious conduct in the management of the\r\nmortar flotilla during the bombardment of Forts Jackson and St. Philip.\r\n\r\nCaptain Silas H. Stringharn, now on the retired list, for distinguished\r\nservices in the capture of Forts Hatteras and Clark.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON. WAR DEPARTMENT, July 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of yesterday is received. Do you not, my good friend,\r\nperceive that what you ask is simply to put you in command in the West?\r\nI do not suppose you desire this. You only wish to control in your own\r\nlocalities; but this you must know may derange all other posts. Can\r\nyou not, and will you not, have a full conference with General Halleck?\r\nTelegraph him, and meet him at such place as he and you can agree upon. I\r\ntelegraph him to meet you and confer fully with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK. WAR DEPARTMENT, July 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth:\r\n\r\nGovernor Johnson, at Nashville, is in great trouble and anxiety about a\r\nraid into Kentucky. The governor is a true and valuable man--indispensable\r\nto us in Tennessee. Will you please get in communication with him,\r\nand have a full conference with him before you leave for here? I have\r\ntelegraphed him on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEAL TO BORDER-STATES IN FAVOR OF COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\nJuly 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--After the adjournment of Congress now very near, I shall have\r\nno opportunity of seeing you for several months. Believing that you of\r\nthe border States hold more power for good than any other equal number of\r\nmembers, I feel it a duty which I cannot justifiably waive to make this\r\nappeal to you. I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you\r\nthat, in my opinion, if you all had voted for the resolution in the\r\ngradual-emancipation message of last March, the war would now be\r\nsubstantially ended. And the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most\r\npotent and swift means of ending it. Let the States which are in rebellion\r\nsee definitely and certainly that in no event will the States you\r\nrepresent ever join their proposed confederacy, and they cannot much\r\nlonger maintain the contest. But you cannot divest them of their hope\r\nto ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to\r\nperpetuate the institution within your own States. Beat them at elections,\r\nas you have overwhelmingly done, and, nothing daunted, they still claim\r\nyou as their own. You and I know what the lever of their power is. Break\r\nthat lever before their faces, and they can shake you no more forever.\r\nMost of you have treated me with kindness and consideration and I trust\r\nyou will not now think I improperly touch what is exclusively your own,\r\nwhen, for the sake of the whole country, I ask, Can you, for your States,\r\ndo better than to take the course I urge? Discarding punctilio and maxims\r\nadapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly\r\nstern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible event? You\r\nprefer that the constitutional relation of the States to the nation shall\r\nbe practically restored without disturbance of the institution; and if\r\nthis were done, my whole duty in this respect, under the Constitution\r\nand my oath of office, would be performed. But it is not done, and we\r\nare trying to accomplish it by war. The incidents of the war cannot be\r\navoided. If the war continues long, as it must if the object be not sooner\r\nattained, the institution in your States will be extinguished by mere\r\nfriction and abrasion--by the mere incidents of the war. It will be gone,\r\nand you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it. Much of its value is\r\ngone already. How much better for you and for your people to take the step\r\nwhich at once shortens the war and secures substantial compensation for\r\nthat which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event! How much better\r\nto thus save the money which else we sink forever in war! How much better\r\nto do it while we can, lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable\r\nto do it! How much better for you as seller, and the nation as buyer, to\r\nsell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been,\r\nthan to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting\r\none another's throats! I do not speak of emancipation at once, but of\r\na decision at once to emancipate gradually. Room in South America for\r\ncolonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance, and when numbers\r\nshall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another, the\r\nfreed people will not be so reluctant to go.\r\n\r\nI am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned--one which threatens\r\ndivision among those who, united, are none too strong. An instance of it\r\nis known to you. General Hunter is an honest man. He was, and I hope still\r\nis, my friend. I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the\r\ngeneral wish that all men everywhere could be free. He proclaimed all men\r\nfree within certain States, and I repudiated the proclamation. He expected\r\nmore good and less harm from the measure than I could believe would\r\nfollow. Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offence, to\r\nmany whose support the country cannot afford to lose. And this is not\r\nthe end of it. The pressure in this direction is still upon me, and is\r\nincreasing. By conceding what I now ask you can relieve me, and, much\r\nmore, can relieve the country in this important point.\r\n\r\nUpon these considerations, I have again begged your attention to the\r\nmessage of March last. Before leaving the Capital, consider and discuss it\r\namong yourselves. You are patriots and statesmen, and as such I pray\r\nyou consider this proposition; and, at the least, commend it to the\r\nconsideration of your States and people. As you would perpetuate popular\r\ngovernment for the best people in the world, I beseech you that you do\r\nin nowise omit this. Our common country is in great peril, demanding the\r\nloftiest views and boldest action to bring a speedy relief. Once relieved,\r\nits form of government is saved to the world; its beloved history and\r\ncherished memories are vindicated, and its happy future fully assured\r\nand rendered inconceivably grand. To you, more than to any others, the\r\nprivilege is given to assure that happiness and swell that grandeur, and\r\nto link your own names therewith forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am told that over 160,000 men have gone into your army\r\non the Peninsula. When I was with you the other day we made out 86,500\r\nremaining, leaving 73,500 to be accounted for. I believe 23,500 will cover\r\nall the killed, wounded, and missing in all your battles and skirmishes,\r\nleaving 50,000 who have left otherwise. No more than 5000 of these have\r\ndied, leaving 45,000 of your army still alive and not with it. I believe\r\nhalf or two-thirds of them are fit for duty to-day. Have you any more\r\nperfect knowledge of this than I have? If I am right, and you had these\r\nmen with you, you could go into Richmond in the next three days. How can\r\nthey be got to you, and how can they be prevented from getting away in\r\nsuch numbers for the future?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nThey are having a stampede in Kentucky. Please look to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. T. BOYLE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nYour several despatches received. You should call on General Halleck.\r\nTelegraph him at once. I have telegraphed him that you are in trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. T. BOYLE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nWe cannot venture to order troops from General Buell. We know not what\r\ncondition he is in. He maybe attacked himself. You must call on General\r\nHalleck, who commands, and whose business it is to understand and care for\r\nthe whole field If you cannot telegraph to him, send a messenger to him. A\r\ndispatch has this moment come from Halleck at Tuscombia, Alabama.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT OF COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nHerewith is the draft of the bill to compensate any State which may\r\nabolish slavery within its limits, the passage of which, substantially as\r\npresented, I respectfully and earnestly recommend.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled:--That whenever the President of\r\nthe United States shall be satisfied that any State shall have lawfully\r\nabolished slavery within and through-out such State, either immediately\r\nor gradually, it shall be the duty of the President, assisted by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, to prepare and deliver to each State an amount\r\nof six per cent. interest-bearing bonds of the United States equal to the\r\naggregate value at ------ dollars per head of all the slaves within such\r\nState, as reported by the census of 1860; the whole amount for any one\r\nState to be delivered at once if the abolishment be immediate, or in equal\r\nannual instalments if it be gradual, interest to begin running on each\r\nbond at the time of delivery, and not before.\r\n\r\nAnd be it further enacted, That if any State, having so received any such\r\nbonds, shall at any time afterwards by law reintroduce or tolerate slavery\r\nwithin its limits, contrary to the act of abolishment upon which such\r\nbonds shall have been received, said bonds so received by said State shall\r\nat once be null and void, in whosesoever hands they may be, and such State\r\nshall refund to the United States all interest which may have been paid on\r\nsuch bonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nI am very anxious--almost impatient--to have you here. Have due regard to\r\nwhat you leave behind. When can you reach here?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, July 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nGeneral Burnside's force is at Newport News, ready to move, on short\r\nnotice, one way or the other, when ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SOLOMON FOOT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 15, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. SOLOMON FOOT, President pro tempore of the Senate.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Please inform the Senate that I shall be obliged if they will\r\npostpone the adjournment at least one day beyond the time which I\r\nunderstand to be now fixed for it.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[The same message was addressed to Hon. Galusha A. Grow Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. July 17, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI have inadvertently omitted so long to inform you that in March last Mr.\r\nCornelius Vanderbilt, of New York, gratuitously presented to the United\r\nStates the ocean steamer Vanderbilt, by many esteemed the finest merchant\r\nship in the world. She has ever since been and still is doing valuable\r\nservice to the government. For the patriotic act of making this\r\nmagnificent and valuable present to the country I recommend that some\r\nsuitable acknowledgment be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. July 17, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nConsidering the bill for \"An act to suppress insurrection, to punish\r\ntreason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and\r\nfor other purposes,\" and the joint resolution explanatory of said act as\r\nbeing substantially one, I have approved and signed both.\r\n\r\nBefore I was informed of the passage of the resolution I had prepared the\r\ndraft of a message stating objections to the bill becoming a law, a copy\r\nof which draft is herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, the bill\r\nfor an act entitled \"An act to suppress treason and rebellion, to seize\r\nand confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,\" together\r\nwith my objections to its becoming a law.\r\n\r\nThere is much in the bill to which I perceive no objection. It is wholly\r\nprospective, and touches neither person nor property of any loyal citizen,\r\nin which particulars it is just and proper. The first and second sections\r\nprovide for the conviction and punishment of persons Who shall be guilty\r\nof treason and persons who shall \"incite, set on foot, assist, or engage\r\nin any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United\r\nStates or the laws thereof, or shall give aid and comfort thereto, or\r\nshall engage in or give aid and comfort to any such existing rebellion or\r\ninsurrection.\" By fair construction persons within these sections are not\r\nto be punished without regular trials in duly constituted courts,\r\nunder the forms and all the substantial provisions of law and of the\r\nConstitution applicable to their several cases. To this I perceive\r\nno objection, especially as such persons would be within the general\r\npardoning power and also the special provision for pardon and amnesty\r\ncontained in this act.\r\n\r\nIt is also provided that the slaves of persons convicted under these\r\nsections shall be free. I think there is an unfortunate form of expression\r\nrather than a substantial objection in this. It is startling to say that\r\nCongress can free a slave within a State, and yet if it were said the\r\nownership of the slave had first been transferred to the nation and that\r\nCongress had then liberated him the difficulty would at once vanish. And\r\nthis is the real case. The traitor against the General Government forfeits\r\nhis slave at least as justly as he does any other property, and he\r\nforfeits both to the government against which be offends. The government,\r\nso far as there can be ownership, thus owns the forfeited slaves, and the\r\nquestion for Congress in regard to them is, \"Shall they be made free or\r\nbe sold to new masters?\" I perceive no objection to Congress deciding in\r\nadvance that they shall be free. To the high honor of Kentucky, as I am\r\ninformed, she is the owner of some slaves by escheat, and has sold none,\r\nbut liberated all. I hope the same is true of some other States. Indeed,\r\nI do not believe it will be physically possible for the General Government\r\nto return persons so circumstanced to actual slavery. I believe there\r\nwould be physical resistance to it which could neither be turned aside\r\nby argument nor driven away by force. In this view I have no objection to\r\nthis feature of the bill. Another matter involved in these two sections,\r\nand running through other parts of the act, will be noticed hereafter.\r\n\r\nI perceive no objection to the third or fourth sections.\r\n\r\nSo far as I wish to notice the fifth and sixth sections, they may be\r\nconsidered together. That the enforcement of these sections would do no\r\ninjustice to the persons embraced within them, is clear. That those who\r\nmake a causeless war should be compelled to pay the cost of it, is too\r\nobviously just to be called in question. To give governmental protection\r\nto the property of persons who have abandoned it, and gone on a crusade to\r\noverthrow the same government, is absurd, if considered in the mere light\r\nof justice. The severest justice may not always be the best policy.\r\nThe principle of seizing and appropriating the property of the persons\r\nembraced within these sections is certainly not very objectionable, but a\r\njustly discriminating application of it would be very difficult and, to\r\na great extent, impossible. And would it not be wise to place a power of\r\nremission somewhere, so that these persons may know they have something to\r\nlose by persisting and something to gain by desisting?\r\n\r\n[A man without hope is a most dangerous man--he has nothing to lose!]\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether such power of remission is or is not in section\r\nthirteen. Without any special act of Congress, I think our military\r\ncommanders, when--in military phrase, \"they are within the enemy's\r\ncountry,\" should, in an orderly manner, seize and use whatever of real or\r\npersonal property may be necessary or convenient for their commands; at\r\nthe same time preserving, in some way, the evidence of what they do.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said in regard to slaves, while commenting on the first and\r\nsecond sections, is applicable to the ninth, with the difference that no\r\nprovision is made in the whole act for determining whether a particular\r\nindividual slave does or does not fall within the classes defined in\r\nthat section. He is to be free upon certain conditions but whether\r\nthose conditions do or do not pertain to him no mode of ascertaining is\r\nprovided. This could be easily supplied.\r\n\r\nTo the tenth section I make no objection. The oath therein required seems\r\nto be proper, and the remainder of the section is substantially identical\r\nwith a law already existing.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh section simply assumes to confer discretionary power upon\r\nthe executive. Without the law, I have no hesitation to go as far in the\r\ndirection indicated as I may at any time deem expedient. And I am ready\r\nto say now--I think it is proper for our military commanders to employ, as\r\nlaborers, as many persons of African descent as can be used to advantage.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better than\r\nunobjectionable; and the fourteenth is entirely proper, if all other parts\r\nof the act shall stand.\r\n\r\nThat to which I chiefly object pervades most parts of the act, but more\r\ndistinctly appears in the first, second, seventh, and eighth sections.\r\nIt is the sum of those provisions which results in the divesting of title\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nFor the causes of treason and ingredients of treason, not amounting to\r\nthe full crime, it declares forfeiture extending beyond the lives of the\r\nguilty parties; whereas the Constitution of the United States declares\r\nthat \"no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture\r\nexcept during the life of the person attainted.\" True, there is to be\r\nno formal attainder in this case; still, I think the greater punishment\r\ncannot be constitutionally inflicted, in a different form, for the same\r\noffence.\r\n\r\nWith great respect I am constrained to say I think this feature of the act\r\nis unconstitutional. It would not be difficult to modify it.\r\n\r\nI may remark that the provision of the Constitution, put in language\r\nborrowed from Great Britain, applies only in this country, as I\r\nunderstand, to real or landed estate.\r\n\r\nAgain, this act in rem forfeits property for the ingredients of treason\r\nwithout a conviction of the supposed criminal, or a personal hearing given\r\nhim in any proceeding. That we may not touch property lying within our\r\nreach, because we cannot give personal notice to an owner who is absent\r\nendeavoring to destroy the government, is certainly not satisfactory.\r\nStill, the owner may not be thus engaged; and I think a reasonable time\r\nshould be provided for such parties to appear and have personal hearings.\r\nSimilar provisions are not uncommon in connection with proceedings in rem.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated, I return the bill to the House in which it\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., July 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nThis is Monday. I hope to be able to tell you on Thursday what is to be\r\ndone with Burnside.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER IN REGARD TO BEHAVIOR OF ALIENS\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe following order has been received from the President of the United\r\nStates:\r\n\r\nRepresentations have been made to the President by the ministers of\r\nvarious foreign powers in amity with the United States that subjects of\r\nsuch powers have during the present insurrection been obliged or required\r\nby military authorities to take an oath of general or qualified allegiance\r\nto this government. It is the duty of all aliens residing in the United\r\nStates to submit to and obey the laws and respect the authority of\r\nthe government. For any proceeding or conduct inconsistent with this\r\nobligation and subversive of that authority they may rightfully be\r\nsubjected to military restraints when this may be necessary. But they\r\ncannot be required to take an oath of allegiance to this government,\r\nbecause it conflicts with the duty they owe to their own sovereigns. All\r\nsuch obligations heretofore taken are therefore remitted and annulled.\r\nMilitary commanders will abstain from imposing similar obligations in\r\nfuture, and will in lieu thereof adopt such other restraints of the\r\ncharacter indicated as they shall find necessary, convenient, and\r\neffectual for the public safety. It is further directed that whenever any\r\norder shall be made affecting the personal liberty of an alien reports of\r\nthe same and of the causes thereof shall be made to the War Department for\r\nthe consideration of the Department of State.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nL. THOMAS, Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER AUTHORIZING EMPLOYMENT OF \"CONTRABANDS.\"\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered:\r\n\r\n1. That military commanders within the States of Virginia, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas in\r\nan orderly manner seize and use any property, real or personal, which may\r\nbe necessary or convenient for their several commands as supplies or for\r\nother military purposes; and that while property may be destroyed for\r\nproper military objects, none shall be destroyed in wantonness or malice.\r\n\r\n2. That military and naval commanders shall employ as laborers within\r\nand from said States so many persons of African descent as can be\r\nadvantageously used for military or naval purposes, giving them reasonable\r\nwages for their labor.\r\n\r\n3. That as to both property and persons of African descent accounts shall\r\nbe kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and amounts\r\nand from whom both property and such persons shall have come, as a basis\r\nupon which compensation can be made in proper cases; and the several\r\ndepartments of this government shall attend to and perform their\r\nappropriate parts toward the execution of these orders.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President: EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING TO REBEL SYMPATHIZERS\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION, JULY 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress entitled \"An act\r\nto suppress insurrection and to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and\r\nconfiscate property of rebels, and for other purposes,\" approved July\r\n17, 1862, and which act and the joint resolution explanatory thereof are\r\nherewith published, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby proclaim to and warn all persons within the contemplation of\r\nsaid sixth section to cease participating in, aiding, countenancing, or\r\nabetting the existing rebellion or any rebellion against the Government of\r\nthe United States and to return to their proper allegiance to the United\r\nStates, on pain of the forfeitures and seizures as within and by said\r\nsixth section provided.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this twenty-fifth day of July, A.D. 1862,\r\nand of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLD MY HAND WHILST THE ENEMY STABS ME\r\n\r\nTO REVERDY JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. REVERDY JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 16th is received...........\r\n\r\nYou are ready to say I apply to friends what is due only to enemies. I\r\ndistrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends who would hold my\r\nhands while my enemies stab me. This appeal of professed friends has\r\nparalyzed me more in this struggle than any other one thing. You remember\r\ntelling me, the day after the Baltimore mob in April, 1861, that it would\r\ncrush all Union feeling in Maryland for me to attempt bringing troops over\r\nMaryland soil to Washington. I brought the troops notwithstanding, and\r\nyet there was Union feeling enough left to elect a Legislature the\r\nnext autumn, which in turn elected a very excellent Union United States\r\nsenator! I am a patient man--always willing to forgive on the Christian\r\nterms of repentance, and also to give ample time for repentance. Still,\r\nI must save this government, if possible. What I cannot do, of course, I\r\nwill not do; but it may as well be understood, once for all, that I shall\r\nnot surrender this game leaving any available card unplayed.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CUTHBERT BULLITT.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July 28, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTHBERT BULLITT, Esq., New Orleans, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The copy of a letter addressed to yourself by Mr. Thomas J. Durant\r\nhas been shown to me. The writer appears to be an able, a dispassionate,\r\nand an entirely sincere man. The first part of the letter is devoted to\r\nan effort to show that the secession ordinance of Louisiana was adopted\r\nagainst the will of a majority of the people. This is probably true,\r\nand in that fact may be found some instruction. Why did they allow the\r\nordinance to go into effect? Why did they not assert themselves? Why stand\r\npassive and allow themselves to be trodden down by minority? Why did they\r\nnot hold popular meetings and have a convention of their own to express\r\nand enforce the true sentiment of the State? If preorganization was\r\nagainst them then, why not do this now that the United States army is\r\npresent to protect them? The paralysis--the dead palsy--of the government\r\nin this whole struggle is that this class of men will do nothing for the\r\ngovernment, nothing for themselves, except demanding that the government\r\nshall not strike its open enemies, lest they be struck by accident!\r\n\r\nMr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of master and slave\r\nis disturbed by the presence of our army, and he considers it particularly\r\nvexatious that this, in part, is done under cover of an act of Congress,\r\nwhile constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of military\r\nnecessity. The truth is, that what is done and omitted about slaves\r\nis done and omitted on the same military necessity. It is a military\r\nnecessity to have men and money; and we can get neither in sufficient\r\nnumbers or amounts if we keep from or drive from our lines slaves coming\r\nto them. Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction,\r\nnor of my efforts to hold it within bounds till he and such as he shall\r\nhave time to help themselves.\r\n\r\nI am not posted to speak understandingly on all the police regulations\r\nof which Mr. Durant complains. If experience shows any one of them to be\r\nwrong, let them be set right. I think I can perceive in the freedom\r\nof trade which Mr. Durant urges that he would relieve both friends and\r\nenemies from the pressure of the blockade. By this he would serve the\r\nenemy more effectively than the enemy is able to serve himself. I do not\r\nsay or believe that to serve the enemy is the purpose, of Mr. Durant,\r\nor that he is conscious of any purpose other than national and patriotic\r\nones. Still, if there were a class of men who, having no choice of sides\r\nin the contest, were anxious only to have quiet and comfort for themselves\r\nwhile it rages, and to fall in with the victorious side at the end of it\r\nwithout loss to themselves, their advice as to the mode of conducting\r\nthe contest would be precisely such as his is. He speaks of no\r\nduty--apparently thinks of none--resting upon Union men. He even thinks it\r\ninjurious to the Union cause that they should be restrained in trade and\r\npassage without taking sides. They are to touch neither a sail nor a pump,\r\nbut to be merely passengers--deadheads at that--to be carried snug and dry\r\nthroughout the storm, and safely landed right side up. Nay, more: even\r\na mutineer is to go untouched, lest these sacred passengers receive an\r\naccidental wound. Of course the rebellion will never be suppressed in\r\nLouisiana if the professed Union men there will neither help to do it nor\r\npermit the government to do it without their help. Now, I think the true\r\nremedy is very different from what is suggested by Mr. Durant. It does not\r\nlie in rounding the rough angles of the war, but in removing the necessity\r\nfor the war. The people of Louisiana who wish protection to person and\r\nproperty have but to reach forth their hands and take it. Let them in good\r\nfaith reinaugurate the national authority, and set up a State government\r\nconforming thereto under the Constitution. They know how to do it and can\r\nhave the protection of the army while doing it. The army will be withdrawn\r\nso soon as such State government can dispense with its presence; and the\r\npeople of the State can then, upon the old constitutional terms, govern\r\nthemselves to their own liking. This is very simple and easy.\r\n\r\nIf they will not do this--if they prefer to hazard all for the sake\r\nof destroying the government--it is for them to consider whether it is\r\nprobable I will surrender the government to save them from losing all. If\r\nthey decline what I suggest, you scarcely need to ask what I will do. What\r\nwould you do in my position? Would you drop the war where it is? Or would\r\nyou prosecute it in future with elder-stalk squirts charged with rose\r\nwater? Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones? Would you\r\ngive up the contest, leaving any available means unapplied? I am in no\r\nboastful mood. I shall not do more than I can, and I shall do all I can,\r\nto save the government, which is my sworn duty as well as my personal\r\ninclination. I shall do nothing in malice. What I deal with is too vast\r\nfor malicious dealing.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LOYAL GOVERNORS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\nJuly 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOVERNORS OF ALL LOYAL STATES:\r\n\r\nIt would be of great service here for us to know, as fully as you can\r\ntell, what progress is made and making in recruiting for old regiments\r\nin your State. Also about what day the first regiments can move with you,\r\nwhat the second, what the third, and so on. This information is important\r\nto us in making calculations. Please give it as promptly and accurately as\r\nyou call.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROKEN EGGS CANNOT BE MENDED\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER TO AUGUST BELMONT.\r\n\r\nJuly 31, 1862.\r\n\r\nBroken eggs cannot be mended; but Louisiana has nothing to do now but to\r\ntake her place in the Union as it was, barring the already broken eggs.\r\nThe sooner she does so, the smaller will be the amount of that which will\r\nbe past mending. This government cannot much longer play a game in\r\nwhich it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing. Those enemies must\r\nunderstand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the\r\ngovernment, and if they fail, still come back into the Union unhurt. If\r\nthey expect in any contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I join\r\nwith the writer in saying, \"Now is the time.\"\r\n\r\nHow much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this,\r\nunder the protection of the army at New Orleans, than to have sat down in\r\na closet writing complaining letters northward!\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COUNT GASPARIN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nAugust 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO COUNT A. DE GASPARIN.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--Your very acceptable letter, dated Orbe, Canton de Vaud,\r\nSwitzerland, 18th of July, 1862, is received. The moral effect was the\r\nworst of the affair before Richmond, and that has run its course downward.\r\nWe are now at a stand, and shall soon be rising again, as we hope. I\r\nbelieve it is true that, in men and material, the enemy suffered more than\r\nwe in that series of conflicts, while it is certain that he is less able\r\nto bear it.\r\n\r\nWith us every soldier is a man of character, and must be treated with\r\nmore consideration than is customary in Europe. Hence our great army, for\r\nslighter causes than could have prevailed there, has dwindled rapidly,\r\nbringing the necessity for a new call earlier than was anticipated. We\r\nshall easily obtain the new levy, however. Be not alarmed if you shall\r\nlearn that we shall have resorted to a draft for part of this. It seems\r\nstrange even to me, but it is true, that the government is now pressed\r\nto this course by a popular demand. Thousands who wish not to personally\r\nenter the service are nevertheless anxious to pay and send substitutes,\r\nprovided they can have assurance that unwilling persons, similarly\r\nsituated, will be compelled to do likewise. Besides this, volunteers\r\nmostly choose to enter newly forming regiments, while drafted men can be\r\nsent to fill up the old ones, wherein man for man they are quite doubly as\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nYou ask, \"Why is it that the North with her great armies so often is found\r\nwith inferiority of numbers face to face with the armies of the South?\"\r\nWhile I painfully know the fact, a military man, which I am not, would\r\nbetter answer the question. The fact I know has not been overlooked, and\r\nI suppose the cause of its continuance lies mainly in the other facts\r\nthat the enemy holds the interior and we the exterior lines, and that\r\nwe operate where the people convey information to the enemy, while he\r\noperates where they convey none to us.\r\n\r\nI have received the volume and letter which you did me the honor of\r\naddressing to me, and for which please accept my sincere thanks. You are\r\nmuch admired in America for the ability of your writings, and much\r\nloved for your generosity to us and your devotion to liberal principles\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nYou are quite right as to the importance to us, for its bearing upon\r\nEurope, that we should achieve military successes, and the same is true\r\nfor us at home as well as abroad. Yet it seems unreasonable that a series\r\nof successes, extending through half a year, and clearing more than\r\n100,000 square miles of country, should help us so little, while a single\r\nhalf-defeat should hurt us so much. But let us be patient.\r\n\r\nI am very happy to know that my course has not conflicted with your\r\njudgment of propriety and policy I can only say that I have acted upon my\r\nbest convictions, without selfishness or malice, and that by the help of\r\nGod I shall continue to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease be assured of my highest respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT A WAR MEETING, WASHINGTON, AUGUST 6, 1862\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS: I believe there is no precedent for my appearing before\r\nyou on this occasion, but it is also true that there is no precedent for\r\nyour being here yourselves, and I offer in justification of myself and\r\nof you that, upon examination, I have found nothing in the Constitution\r\nagainst it. I, however, have an impression that; there are younger\r\ngentlemen who will entertain you better and better address your\r\nunderstanding than I will or could, and therefore I propose but to detain\r\nyou a moment longer. I am very little inclined on any occasion to say\r\nanything unless I hope to produce some good by it. The only thing I think\r\nof just now not likely to be better said by some one else is a matter in\r\nwhich we have heard some other persons blamed for what I did myself There\r\nhas been a very widespread attempt to have a quarrel between General\r\nMcClellan and the Secretary of War Now, I occupy a position that enables\r\nme to believe that these two gentlemen are not nearly so deep in the\r\nquarrel as some presuming to be their friends. General McClellan's\r\nattitude is such that in the very selfishness of his nature he cannot but\r\nwish to be successful--and I hope he will--and the Secretary of War is\r\nprecisely in the same situation. If the military commanders in the field\r\ncannot be successful, not only the Secretary of War, but myself, for the\r\ntime being the master of both, cannot but be failures. I know General\r\nMcClellan wishes to be successful, and I know he does not wish it any more\r\nthan the Secretary of War for him, and both of them together no more\r\nthan I wish it. Sometimes we have a dispute about how many men General\r\nMcClellan has had, and those who would disparage him say he has had a very\r\nlarge number, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War insist\r\nthat General McClellan has had a very small number. The basis for this is,\r\nthere is always a wide difference, and on this occasion perhaps a wider\r\none, between the grand total on McClellan's rolls and the men actually\r\nfit for duty; and those who would disparage him talk of the grand total on\r\npaper, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War talk of those\r\nat present fit for duty. General McClellan has sometimes asked for things\r\nthat the Secretary of War did not give him. General McClellan is not to\r\nblame for asking for what he wanted and needed, and the Secretary of War\r\nis not to blame for not giving when he had none to give. And I say here,\r\nso far as I know, the Secretary of War has withheld no one thing at any\r\ntime in my power to give him. I have no accusation against him. I believe\r\nhe is a brave and able man, and I stand here, as justice requires me to\r\ndo, to take upon myself what has been charged on the Secretary of War as\r\nwithholding from him. I have talked longer than I expected to do, and now\r\nI avail myself of my privilege of saying no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR ANDREW. August 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR ANDREW, Boston, Mass.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch saying \"I can't get those regiments off because I can't\r\nget quick work out of the V. S. disbursing officer and the paymaster\" is\r\nreceived. Please say to these gentlemen that if they do not work quickly I\r\nwill make quick work with them. In the name of all that is reasonable, how\r\nlong does it take to pay a couple of regiments? We were never more in need\r\nof the arrival of regiments than now--even to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN. August 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg, Penn.:\r\n\r\nIt is very important for some regiments to arrive here at once. What lack\r\nyou from us? What can we do to expedite matters? Answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. R. CURTIS. August 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nWould the completion of the railroad some distance farther in the\r\ndirection of Springfield, Mo., be of any military advantage to you? Please\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS ON COLONIZATION TO A DEPUTATION OF COLORED MEN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Thursday, August 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon the President of the United States gave an audience to a\r\ncommittee of colored men at the White House. They were introduced by\r\nRev. J. Mitchell, Commissioner of Emigration, E. M. Thomas, the chairman,\r\nremarked that they were there by invitation to hear what the Executive had\r\nto say to them.\r\n\r\nHaving all been seated, the President, after a few preliminary\r\nobservations, informed them that a sum of money had been appropriated by\r\nCongress, and placed at his disposition, for the purpose of aiding the\r\ncolonization, in some country, of the people, or a portion of them, of\r\nAfrican descent, thereby making it his duty, as it had for a long time\r\nbeen his inclination, to favor that cause. And why, he asked, should the\r\npeople of your race be colonized, and where? Why should they leave this\r\ncountry? This is, perhaps, the first question for proper consideration.\r\nYou and we are different races. We have between us a broader difference\r\nthan exists between almost any other two races. Whether it is right\r\nor wrong I need not discuss; but this physical difference is a great\r\ndisadvantage to us both, as I think. Your race suffer very greatly, many\r\nof them, by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence. In a\r\nword, we suffer on each side. If this is admitted, it affords a reason, at\r\nleast, why we should be separated. You here are free men, I suppose.\r\n\r\n[A voice--\"Yes, sir!\"]\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have long been free, or all your lives. Your race are\r\nsuffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people.\r\nBut even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being\r\nplaced on an equality with the white race. You are cut off from many of\r\nthe advantages which the other race enjoys. The aspiration of men is to\r\nenjoy equality with the best when free, but on this broad continent not\r\na single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours. Go\r\nwhere you are treated the best, and the ban is still upon you. I do not\r\npropose to discuss this, but to present it as a fact, with which we have\r\nto deal. I cannot alter it if I would. It is a fact about which we all\r\nthink and feel alike, I and you. We look to our condition. Owing to the\r\nexistence of the two races on this continent, I need not recount to you\r\nthe effects upon white men, growing out of the institution of slavery.\r\n\r\nI believe in its general evil effects on the white race. See our present\r\ncondition--the country engaged in war--white men cutting one another's\r\nthroats--none knowing how far it will extend--and then consider what we\r\nknow to be the truth: But for your race among us there could not be war,\r\nalthough many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or\r\nthe other. Nevertheless I repeat, without the institution of slavery and\r\nthe colored race as a basis, the war could not have an existence. It is\r\nbetter for us both, therefore, to be separated. I know that there are free\r\nmen among you, who, even if they could better their condition, are not as\r\nmuch inclined to go out of the country as those who, being slaves, could\r\nobtain their freedom on this condition. I suppose one of the principal\r\ndifficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man\r\ncannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it. You may believe\r\nthat you can live in WASHINGTON, or elsewhere in the United States, the\r\nremainder of your life, as easily, perhaps more so, than you can in any\r\nforeign Country; and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have\r\nnothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country.\r\n\r\nThis is (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish view of the\r\ncase. You ought to do something to help those who are not so fortunate as\r\nyourselves. There is an unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh\r\nas it may be, for you free colored people to remain with us. Now, if you\r\ncould give a start to the white people, you would open a wide door for\r\nmany to be made free. If we deal with those who are not free at the\r\nbeginning, and whose intellects are clouded by slavery, we have very poor\r\nmaterial to start with. If intelligent colored men, such as are before me,\r\nwould move in this matter, much might be accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly important that we have men at the beginning capable\r\nof thinking as white men, and not those who have been systematically\r\noppressed. There is much to encourage you. For the sake of your race you\r\nshould sacrifice something of your present comfort for the purpose of\r\nbeing as grand in that respect as the white people. It is a cheering\r\nthought throughout life that something can be done to ameliorate the\r\ncondition of those who have been subject to the hard usages of the world.\r\nIt is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of\r\nhimself and claims kindred to the great God who made him. In the American\r\nRevolutionary war sacrifices were made by men engaged in it, but they were\r\ncheered by the future. General WASHINGTON himself endured greater physical\r\nhardships than if he had remained a British subject, yet he was a happy\r\nman because he had engaged in benefiting his race, in doing something for\r\nthe children of his neighbors, having none of his own.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time. In a certain\r\nsense it is a success. The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just\r\nbeen with me--the first time I ever saw him. He says they have within the\r\nbounds of that colony between three and four hundred thousand people, or\r\nmore than in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island or Delaware,\r\nor in some of our newer States, and less than in some of our larger ones.\r\nThey are not all American colonists or their descendants. Something less\r\nthan 12,000 have been sent thither from this country. Many of the original\r\nsettlers have died; yet, like people else-where, their offspring outnumber\r\nthose deceased. The question is, if the colored people are persuaded to go\r\nanywhere, why not there?\r\n\r\nOne reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather\r\nremain within reach of the country of your nativity. I do not know how\r\nmuch attachment you may have toward our race. It does not strike me that\r\nyou have the greatest reason to love them. But still you are attached to\r\nthem, at all events.\r\n\r\nThe place I am thinking about for a colony is in Central America. It is\r\nnearer to us than Liberia not much more than one fourth as far as Liberia,\r\nand within seven days' run by steamers. Unlike Liberia, it is a great line\r\nof travel--it is a highway. The country is a very excellent one for any\r\npeople, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially\r\nbecause of the similarity of climate with your native soil, thus being\r\nsuited to your physical condition. The particular place I have in view is\r\nto be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific\r\nOcean, and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony. On\r\nboth sides there are harbors--among the finest in the world. Again, there\r\nis evidence of very rich coal-mines. A certain amount of coal is valuable\r\nin any country. Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford\r\nan opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get\r\nready to settle permanently in their homes. If you take colonists where\r\nthere is no good landing, there is a bad show; and so where there is\r\nnothing to cultivate and of which to make a farm. But if something is\r\nstarted so that you can get your daily bread as soon as reach you there,\r\nit is a great advantage. Coal land is the best thing I know of with which\r\nto commence an enterprise. To return--you have been talked to upon this\r\nsubject, and told that a speculation is intended by gentlemen who have an\r\ninterest in the country, including the coal-mines. We have been mistaken\r\nall our lives if we do not know whites, as well as blacks, look to their\r\nself-interest. Unless among those deficient of intellect, everybody\r\nyou trade with makes something. You meet with these things here and\r\neverywhere. If such persons have what will be an advantage to them,\r\nthe question is whether it cannot be made of advantage to you. You are\r\nintelligent, and know that success does not so much depend on external\r\nhelp as on self-reliance. Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves. As to\r\nthe coal-mines, I think I see the means available for your self-reliance.\r\nI shall, if I get a sufficient number of you engaged, have provision made\r\nthat you shall not be wronged. If you will engage in the enterprise,\r\nI will spend some of the money intrusted to me. I am not sure you will\r\nsucceed. The government may lose the money; but we cannot succeed unless\r\nwe try, and we think with care we can succeed. The political affairs in\r\nCentral America are not in quite as satisfactory a condition as I wish.\r\nThere are contending factions in that quarter, but it is true all the\r\nfactions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization, and want it, and\r\nare more generous than we are here.\r\n\r\nTo your colored race they have no objection I would endeavor to have\r\nyou made the equals, and have the best assurance that you should be the\r\nequals, of the best.\r\n\r\nThe practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can get a number of\r\nable-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to go when\r\nI present evidence of encouragement and protection. Could I get a hundred\r\ntolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, and able to\r\n\"cut their own fodder,\" so to speak? Can I have fifty? If I could find\r\ntwenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and children--good\r\nthings in the family relation, I think,--I could make a successful\r\ncommencement. I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not.\r\nThis is the practical part of my wish to see you. These are subjects of\r\nvery great importance, worthy of a month's study, instead of a speech\r\ndelivered in an hour. I ask you, then, to consider seriously, not\r\npertaining to yourselves merely, nor for your race and ours for the\r\npresent time, but as one of the things, if successfully managed, the good\r\nof mankind--not confined to the present generation, but as\r\n\r\n  \"From age to age descends the lay\r\n   To millions yet to be,\r\n   Till far its echoes roll away\r\n   Into eternity.\"\r\n\r\nThe above is merely given as the substance of the President's remarks.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the delegation briefly replied that they would hold a\r\nconsultation, and in a short time give an answer.\r\n\r\nThe President said: Take your full time-no hurry at all.\r\n\r\nThe delegation then withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO OFFICER AT CAMP CHASE, OHIO.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

It\r\nis certainly a case of difficulty, but if you cannot remain, I cannot\r\nconceive who under my authority can. Remain as long as you safely can and\r\nprovide as well as you can for the poor inmates of the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I have just read yours of the 19th, addressed to myself through\r\nthe New York Tribune. If there be in it any statements or assumptions of\r\nfact which I may know to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert\r\nthem. If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be falsely\r\ndrawn, I do not now and here argue against them. If there be perceptible\r\nin it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old\r\nfriend, whose heart I have always supposed to be right.\r\n\r\nAs to the policy I \"seem to be pursuing,\" as you say, I have not meant to\r\nleave any one in doubt.\r\n\r\nI would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the\r\nConstitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored, the\r\nnearer the Union will be, \"the Union as it was.\" If there be those who\r\nwould not save the Union unless they could at the same time save slavery,\r\nI do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union\r\nunless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with\r\nthem. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is\r\nnot either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without\r\nfreeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing\r\nall the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and\r\nleaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and\r\nthe colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save this Union; and\r\nwhat I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save\r\nthe Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts\r\nthe cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will\r\nhelp the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and\r\nI shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. I\r\nhave here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty, and\r\nI intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men,\r\neverywhere, could be free.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR YATES.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., August 13.1862. 8 A.M.\r\n\r\nHON. R. YATES, Springfield, Ill.:\r\n\r\nI am pained to hear that you reject the service of an officer we sent\r\nto assist in organizing and getting off troops. Pennsylvania and Indiana\r\naccepted such officers kindly, and they now have more than twice as many\r\nnew troops in the field as all the other States together. If Illinois\r\nhad got forward as many troops as Indiana, Cumberland Gap would soon be\r\nrelieved from its present peril. Please do not ruin us on punctilio.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

While I am not surprised at your anxiety, I do\r\nnot think you are in any danger. If half our troops were in Philadelphia,\r\nthe enemy could take it, because he would not fear to leave the other half\r\nin his rear; but with the whole of them here, he dares not leave them in\r\nhis rear.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CURTIN. September 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY ANDREW G. CURTIN, Governor of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg,\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The application made to me by your adjutant general for authority\r\nto call out the militia of the State of Pennsylvania has received careful\r\nconsideration. It is my anxious desire to afford, as far as possible,\r\nthe means and power of the Federal Government to protect the State\r\nof Pennsylvania from invasion by the rebel forces; and since, in your\r\njudgment, the militia of the State are required, and have been called upon\r\nby you, to organize for home defense and protection, I sanction the call\r\nthat you have made, and will receive them into the service and pay of\r\nthe United States to the extent they can be armed, equipped, and usefully\r\nemployed. The arms and equipments now belonging to the General Government\r\nwill be needed for the troops called out for the national armies, so that\r\narms can only be furnished for the quota of militia furnished by the draft\r\nof nine months' men, heretofore ordered. But as arms may be supplied by\r\nthe militia under your call, these, with the 30,000 in your arsenal, will\r\nprobably be sufficient for the purpose contemplated by your call. You will\r\nbe authorized to provide such equipments as may be required, according\r\nto the regulations of the United States service, which, upon being turned\r\nover to the United States Quartermaster's Department, will be paid for\r\nat regulation prices, or the rates allowed by the department for such\r\narticles. Railroad transportation will also be paid for, as in other\r\ncases. Such general officers will be supplied as the exigencies of the\r\nservice will permit.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, September 11, 1862 12M\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW G. CURTIN:\r\n\r\nPlease tell me at once what is your latest news from or toward Hagerstown,\r\nor of the enemy's movement in any direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL C. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, SEPTEMBER 11, 1862. 6 PM\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nThis is explanatory. If Porter, Heintzelman, and Sigel were sent you, it\r\nwould sweep everything from the other side of the river, because the new\r\ntroops have been distributed among them, as I understand. Porter reports\r\nhimself 21,000 strong, which can only be by the addition of new troops.\r\nHe is ordered tonight to join you as quickly as possible. I am for sending\r\nyou all that can be spared, and I hope others can follow Porter very soon,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, D.C., SEPTEMBER 12, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN, Clarksburg, Maryland:\r\n\r\nHow does it look now?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON D.C., SEPTEMBER 12, 1862 10.35 AM\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW G. CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania:\r\n\r\nYour despatch asking for 80,000 disciplined troops to be sent to\r\nPennsylvania is received. Please consider we have not to exceed 80,000\r\ndisciplined troops, properly so called, this side of the mountains; and\r\nmost of them, with many of the new regiments, are now close in the rear\r\nof the enemy supposed to be invading Pennsylvania. Start half of them to\r\nHarrisburg, and the enemy will turn upon and beat the remaining half, and\r\nthen reach Harrisburg before the part going there, and beat it too when\r\nit comes. The best possible security for Pennsylvania is putting the\r\nstrongest force possible in rear of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. G. WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nMILITARY TELEGRAPH, WASHINGTON, September 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:\r\n\r\nI am being appealed to from Louisville against your withdrawing troops\r\nfrom that place. While I cannot pretend to judge of the propriety of what\r\nyou are doing, you would much oblige me by furnishing me a rational answer\r\nto make to the governor and others at Louisville.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. T. BOYLE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, September 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BOYLE, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of last evening received. Where is the enemy which you dread\r\nin Louisville? How near to you? What is General Gilbert's opinion? With\r\nall possible respect for you, I must think General Wright's military\r\nopinion is the better. He is as much responsible for Louisville as\r\nfor Cincinnati. General Halleck telegraphed him on this very subject\r\nyesterday, and I telegraph him now; but for us here to control him\r\nthere on the ground would be a babel of confusion which would be utterly\r\nruinous. Where do you understand Buell to be, and what is he doing?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO A. HENRY.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C, September 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. ALEXANDER HENRY, Philadelphia:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day received. General Halleck has made the best provision he\r\ncan for generals in Pennsylvania. Please do not be offended when I assure\r\nyou that in my confident belief Philadelphia is in no danger. Governor\r\nCurtin has just telegraphed me: \"I have advices that Jackson is crossing\r\nthe Potomac at Williamsport, and probably the whole rebel army will be\r\ndrawn from Maryland.\" At all events, Philadelphia is more than 150 miles\r\nfrom Hagerstown, and could not be reached by the rebel army in ten days,\r\nif no hindrance was interposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, D.C., September 12, 1862. 5.45 PM\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nGovernor Curtin telegraphs me:\r\n\r\n\"I have advices that Jackson is crossing the Potomac at Williamsport, and\r\nprobably the whole rebel army will be down from Maryland.\"\r\n\r\nReceiving nothing from Harper's Ferry or Martinsburg to-day, and positive\r\ninformation from Wheeling that the line is cut, corroborates the idea that\r\nthe enemy is crossing the Potomac. Please do not let him get off without\r\nbeing hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n    [But he did! D.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO REQUEST THE PRESIDENT ISSUE A PROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\nA COMMITTEE FROM THE RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS OF CHICAGO,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 13,1862.\r\n\r\nThe subject presented in the memorial is one upon which I have thought\r\nmuch for weeks past, and I may even say for months. I am approached with\r\nthe most opposite opinions and advice, and that by religious men, who are\r\nequally certain that they represent the Divine will. I am sure that either\r\nthe one or the other class is mistaken in that belief, and perhaps in some\r\nrespects both. I hope it will not be irreverent for me to say that if\r\nit is probable that God would reveal his will to others, on a point so\r\nconnected with my duty, it might be supposed he would reveal it directly\r\nto me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself than I often am, it is my\r\nearnest desire to know the will of Providence in this matter. And if I\r\ncan learn what it is I will do it! These are not, however, the days of\r\nmiracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a\r\ndirect revelation. I must study the plain physical facts of the case,\r\nascertain what is possible, and learn what appears to be wise and right.\r\n\r\nThe subject is difficult, and good men do not agree. For instance, the\r\nother day, four gentlemen of standing and intelligence from New York\r\ncalled as a delegation on business connected with the war; but\r\nbefore leaving two of them earnestly besought me to proclaim general\r\nemancipation, upon which the other two at once attacked them. You\r\nknow also that the last session of Congress had a decided majority of\r\nantislavery men, yet they could not unite on this policy. And the same is\r\ntrue of the religious people. Why, the rebel soldiers are praying with a\r\ngreat deal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and expecting\r\nGod to favor their side: for one of our soldiers who had been taken\r\nprisoner told Senator Wilson a few days since that he met nothing so\r\ndiscouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among in their\r\nprayers. But we will talk over the merits of the case.\r\n\r\nWhat good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do, especially\r\nas we are now situated? I do not want to issue a document that the whole\r\nworld will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope's bull\r\nagainst the comet! Would my word free the slaves, when I cannot even\r\nenforce the Constitution in the rebel States? Is there a single court, or\r\nmagistrate or individual that would be influenced by it there? And what\r\nreason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the\r\nslaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved, and which offers\r\nprotection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our\r\nlines? Yet I cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come\r\nover to us. And suppose they could be induced by a proclamation of freedom\r\nfrom me to throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them? How can\r\nwe feed and care for such a multitude? General Butler wrote me a few days\r\nsince that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to\r\nhim than to all the white troops under his command. They eat, and that is\r\nall; though it is true General Butler is feeding the whites also by the\r\nthousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there. If, now, the pressure\r\nof the war should call off our forces from New Orleans to defend some\r\nother point, what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks\r\nto slavery again? for I am told that whenever the rebels take any black\r\nprisoners, free or slave, they immediately auction them off. They did so\r\nwith those they took from a boat that was aground in the Tennessee River\r\na few days ago. And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it! For\r\ninstance, when, after the late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition\r\nwent out from Washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring\r\nin the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help,\r\nand sent them into slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the\r\ngovernment would probably do nothing about it. What could I do?\r\n\r\nNow, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would\r\nfollow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire? Understand, I\r\nraise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds; for, as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy, in time of war I suppose I have\r\na right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy; nor do I\r\nurge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of\r\ninsurrection and massacre at the South. I view this matter as a practical\r\nwar measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages\r\nit may offer to the suppression of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nI admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion, or at least its sine\r\nqua non. The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act, but\r\nthey would have been impotent without slavery as their instrument. I will\r\nalso concede that emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them\r\nthat we are incited by something more than ambition. I grant, further,\r\nthat it would help somewhat at the North, though not so much, I fear, as\r\nyou and those you represent imagine. Still, some additional strength would\r\nbe added in that way to the war, and then, unquestionably, it would weaken\r\nthe rebels by drawing off their laborers, which is of great importance;\r\nbut I am not so sure we could do much with the blacks. If we were to arm\r\nthem, I fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the\r\nrebels; and, indeed, thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our\r\nwhite troops. I will mention another thing, though it meet only your scorn\r\nand contempt. There are fifty thousand bayonets in the Union armies from\r\nthe border slave States. It would be a serious matter if, in consequence\r\nof a proclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the rebels. I\r\ndo not think they all would--not so many, indeed, as a year ago, or as\r\nsix months ago--not so many to-day as yesterday. Every day increases their\r\nUnion feeling. They are also getting their pride enlisted, and want to\r\nbeat the rebels. Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit that\r\nwe already have an important principle to rally and unite the people, in\r\nthe fact that constitutional government is at stake. This is a fundamental\r\nidea going down about as deep as anything.\r\n\r\nDo not misunderstand me because I have mentioned these objections. They\r\nindicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some\r\nsuch way as you desire. I have not decided against a proclamation of\r\nliberty to the slaves, but hold the matter under advisement; and I can\r\nassure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and night, more than any\r\nother. Whatever shall appear to be God's will, I will do. I trust that\r\nin the freedom with which I have canvassed your views I have not in any\r\nrespect injured your feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. G. WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:\r\n\r\nThanks for your despatch.

DUBOIS, Springfield, Illinois:\r\n\r\nI now consider it safe to say that General McClellan has gained a great\r\nvictory over the great rebel army in Maryland, between Fredericktown and\r\nHagerstown. He is now pursuing the flying foe.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[But not very fast--and he did not catch them! D.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

MORTON, Indianapolis, Indiana:\r\n\r\nI have received your despatch in regard to recommendations of General\r\nWright. I have received no such despatch from him, at least not that I can\r\nremember.

How many arms have you there ready for distribution?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, SEPTEMBER 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby proclaim and\r\ndeclare that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the\r\nobject of practically restoring the constitutional relation between the\r\nUnited States and each of the States and the people thereof in which\r\nStates that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed.\r\n\r\nThat it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress, to again\r\nrecommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary aid\r\nto the free acceptance or rejection of all slave States, so called, the\r\npeople whereof may not then be in rebellion against the United States,\r\nand which States may then have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may\r\nvoluntarily adopt, immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery within\r\ntheir respective limits; and that the effort to colonize persons of\r\nAfrican descent with their consent upon this continent or elsewhere, with\r\nthe previously obtained consent of the governments existing there, will be\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nThat on the 1st day of January, A.D. 1863, all persons held as slaves\r\nwithin any State or designated part of a State the people whereof\r\nshall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then,\r\nthenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the\r\nUnited States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will\r\nrecognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or\r\nacts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make\r\nfor their actual freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the Executive will on the 1st day of January aforesaid, by\r\nproclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which\r\nthe people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the\r\nUnited States; and the fact that any State or the people thereof shall on\r\nthat day be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United States\r\nby members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified\r\nvoters of such State shall have participated shall, in the absence of\r\nstrong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such\r\nState and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThat attention is hereby called to an act of Congress entitled \"An act to\r\nmake an additional article of war,\" approved March 13, 1862, and which act\r\nis in the words and figure following:\r\n\r\n\"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, That hereafter the following\r\nshall be promulgated as an additional article of war for the government of\r\nthe Army of the United States and shall be obeyed and observed as such.\r\n\r\n\"ART. All officers or persons in the military or naval service of the\r\nUnited States are prohibited from employing any of the forces under their\r\nrespective commands for the purpose of returning fugitives from service or\r\nlabor who may have escaped from any person, to whom such service or labor\r\nis claimed to be due, and any officer who shall be found guilty by a\r\ncourt-martial of violating this article shall be dismissed from the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\"SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That this act shall take effect from\r\nand after its passage.\"\r\n\r\nAlso to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled \"An act to\r\nsuppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and\r\nconfiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,\" approved July\r\n17, 1862, and which sections are in the words and figures following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SEC. 9.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION SUSPENDING THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS,\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nWhereas it has become necessary to call into service not only volunteers,\r\nbut also portions of the militia of the States by draft, in order to\r\nsuppress the insurrection existing in the United States, and disloyal\r\npersons are not adequately restrained by the ordinary processes of law\r\nfrom hindering this measure, and from giving aid and comfort in various\r\nways to the insurrection:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it ordered\r\n\r\nFirst. That during the existing insurrection, and as a necessary measure\r\nfor suppressing the same, all rebels and insurgents, their aiders and\r\nabettors within the United States, and all persons discouraging volunteer\r\nenlistments, resisting militia drafts, or guilty of any disloyal practice\r\naffording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of the\r\nUnited States, shall be subject to martial law, and liable to trial and\r\npunishment by courts-martial or military commissions.\r\n\r\nSecond. That the writ of habeas corpus is suspended in respect to all\r\npersons arrested, or who are now, or hereafter during the rebellion shall\r\nbe, imprisoned in any fort camp, arsenal, military prison or other\r\nplace of confinement by any military authority or by the sentence of any\r\ncourt-martial or military commission.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of WASHINGTON, this twenty-fourth day of September. A.D.\r\neighteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence of the United\r\nStates the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO SERENADE, SEPTEMBER 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nI appear before you to do little more than acknowledge the courtesy you\r\npay me, and to thank you for it. I have not been distinctly informed\r\nwhy it is that on this occasion you appear to do me this honor, though I\r\nsuppose it is because of the proclamation. What I did, I did after a\r\nvery full deliberation, and under a very heavy and solemn sense of\r\nresponsibility. I can only trust in God I have made no mistake. I shall\r\nmake no attempt on this occasion to sustain what I have done or said by\r\nany comment. It is now for the country and the world to pass judgment and,\r\nmaybe, take action upon it.\r\n\r\nI will say no more upon this subject. In my position I am environed with\r\ndifficulties. Yet they are scarcely so great as the difficulties of those\r\nwho upon the battle-field are endeavoring to purchase with their blood and\r\ntheir lives the future happiness and prosperity of this country. Let us\r\nnever forget them. On the fourteenth and seventeenth days of this present\r\nmonth there have been battles bravely, skillfully, and successfully\r\nfought. We do not yet know the particulars. Let us be sure that, in giving\r\npraise to certain individuals, we do no injustice to others. I only ask\r\nyou, at the conclusion of these few remarks, to give three hearty cheers\r\nfor all good and brave officers and men who fought those successful\r\nbattles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD EXPLAINING THE DISMISSAL OF MAJOR JOHN J. KEY\r\n\r\nFROM THE MILITARY SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nSeptember 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR JOHN J. KEY:\r\n\r\nI am informed that, in answer to the question, \"Why was not the rebel army\r\nbagged immediately after the battle near Sharpsburg?\" propounded to you\r\nby Major Levi C. Turner, Judge Advocate, etc., you said: \"That is not the\r\ngame. The object is, that neither army shall get much advantage of the\r\nother; that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhausted, when\r\nwe will make a compromise and save slavery.\"\r\n\r\nI shall be very happy if you will, within twenty-four hours from the\r\nreceipt of this, prove to me by Major Turner that you did not, either\r\nliterally or in substance, make the answer stated.\r\n\r\n[Above delivered to Major Key at 10.25 a.m. September 27th.]\r\n\r\nAt about 11 o'clock A.M., September 27, 1862, Major Key and Major Turner\r\nappeared before me. Major Turner says:\r\n\r\n\"As I remember it, the conversation was: 'Why did we not bag them after\r\nthe battle of Sharpsburg?' Major Key's reply was: 'That was not the game;\r\nthat we should tire the rebels out and ourselves; that that was the\r\nonly way the Union could be preserved, we come together fraternally, and\r\nslavery be saved.'\"\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Major Turner says he has frequently heard Major Key\r\nconverse in regard to the present troubles, and never heard him utter\r\na sentiment unfavorable to the maintenance of the Union. He has never\r\nuttered anything which he, Major T., would call disloyalty. The particular\r\nconversation detailed was a private one.\r\n\r\n           [Indorsement on the above.]\r\n\r\nIn my view, it is wholly inadmissible for any gentleman holding a military\r\ncommission from the United States to utter such sentiments as Major Key is\r\nwithin proved to have done. Therefore, let Major John J. Key be forthwith\r\ndismissed from the military service of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\n(Strictly private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nSeptember 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Your kind letter of the 25th is just received. It is known to\r\nsome that, while I hope something from the proclamation, my expectations\r\nare not as sanguine as are those of some friends. The time for its effect\r\nsouthward has not come; but northward the effect should be instantaneous.\r\nIt is six days old, and, while commendation in newspapers and by\r\ndistinguished individuals is all that a vain man could wish, the stocks\r\nhave declined, and troops come forward more slowly than ever. This, looked\r\nsoberly in the face, is not very satisfactory. We have fewer troops in\r\nthe field at the end of the six days than we had at the beginning--the\r\nattrition among the old outnumbering the addition by the new. The North\r\nresponds to the proclamation sufficiently in breath; but breath alone\r\nkills no rebels.\r\n\r\nI wish I could write more cheerfully; nor do I thank you the less for the\r\nkindness of your letter.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL HALLECK.\r\n\r\nMcCLELLAN'S HEADQUARTERS, October 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nGeneral Stuart, of the rebel army, has sent in a few of our prisoners\r\nunder a flag of truce, paroled with terms to prevent their fighting the\r\nIndians, and evidently seeking to commit us to their right to parole\r\nprisoners in that way. My inclination is to send the prisoners back with\r\na definite notice that we will recognize no paroles given to our prisoners\r\nby the rebels as extending beyond a prohibition against fighting them,\r\nthough I wish your opinion upon it, based both upon the general law and\r\nour cartel. I wish to avoid violations of the law and bad faith. Answer as\r\nquickly as possible, as the thing, if done at all, should be done at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS TO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC AT FREDERICK, MARYLAND,\r\n\r\nOCTOBER, 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nI am surrounded by soldiers and a little farther off by the citizens of\r\nthis good City of Frederick. Nevertheless I can only say, as I did five\r\nminutes ago, it is not proper for me to make speeches in my present\r\nposition. I return thanks to our soldiers for the good services they have\r\nrendered, the energy they have shown, the hardships they have endured, and\r\nthe blood they have shed for this Union of ours; and I also return thanks,\r\nnot only to the soldiers, but to the good citizens of Frederick, and to\r\nthe good men, women, and children in this land of ours, for their devotion\r\nto this glorious cause; and I say this with no malice in my heart towards\r\nthose who have done otherwise. May our children and children's children,\r\nfor a thousand generations, continue to enjoy the benefits conferred upon\r\nus by a united country, and have cause yet to rejoice under these glorious\r\ninstitutions, bequeathed to us by WASHINGTON and his compeers. Now, my\r\nfriends, soldiers and citizens, I can only say once more-farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM GENERAL HALLECK\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN., WASHINGTON, D. C., October 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI am instructed to telegraph you as follows: The President directs that\r\nyou cross the Potomac and give battle to the enemy, or drive him south.\r\nYour army must move now, while the roads are good. If you cross the river\r\nbetween the enemy and Washington, and cover the latter by your operation,\r\nyou can be reinforced by thirty thousand men. If you move up the valley of\r\nthe Shenandoah, not more than twelve or fifteen thousand can be sent you.\r\nThe President advises the interior line between Washington and the enemy,\r\nbut does not order it. He is very desirous that your army move as soon as\r\npossible. You will immediately report what line you adopt, and when you\r\nintend to cross the river; also to what point the reinforcements are to\r\nbe sent. It is necessary that the plan of your operations be positively\r\ndetermined on, before orders are given for building bridges and repairing\r\nrailroads. I am directed to add that the Secretary of War and the\r\nGeneral-in-chief fully concur with the President in these directions.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 7, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN, Hdqs. Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nYou wish to see your family and I wish to oblige you. It might be left\r\nto your own discretion; certainly so, if Mrs. M. could meet you here at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. H. CLAY.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS H. CLAY, Cincinnati, Ohio:\r\n\r\nYou cannot have reflected seriously when you ask that I shall order\r\nGeneral Morgan's command to Kentucky as a favor because they have marched\r\nfrom Cumberland Gap. The precedent established by it would evidently break\r\nup the whole army. Buell's old troops, now in pursuit of Bragg, have done\r\nmore hard marching recently; and, in fact, if you include marching and\r\nfighting, there are scarcely any old troops east or west of the mountains\r\nthat have not done as hard service. I sincerely wish war was an easier\r\nand pleasanter business than it is; but it does not admit of holidays.\r\nOn Morgan's command, where it is now sent, as I understand, depends the\r\nquestion whether the enemy will get to the Ohio River in another place.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., October 8, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nI congratulate you and all concerned in your recent battles and victories.\r\nHow does it all sum up? I especially regret the death of General\r\nHackleman, and am very anxious to know the condition of General Oglesby,\r\nwho is an intimate personal friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. T. BOYLE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 11,1862. 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BOYLE, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nPlease send any news you have from General Buell to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. T. BOYLE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 12, 1862. 4.10 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BOYLE, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nWe are anxious to hear from General Buell's army. We have heard nothing\r\nsince day before yesterday. Have you anything?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., October 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, Saint Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nWould the completion of the railroad some distance further in the\r\ndirection of Springfield, Mo., be of any military advantage to you? Please\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--You remember my speaking to you of what I called your\r\nover-cautiousness. Are you not over-cautious when you assume that you\r\ncannot do what the enemy is constantly doing? Should you not claim to be\r\nat least his equal in prowess, and act upon the claim?\r\n\r\nAs I understand, you telegraphed General Halleck that you cannot subsist\r\nyour army at Winchester unless the railroad from Harper's Ferry to that\r\npoint be put in working order. But the enemy does now subsist his army\r\nat Winchester, at a distance nearly twice as great from railroad\r\ntransportation as you would have to do, without the railroad last named.\r\nHe now wagons from Culpepper Court-House, which is just about twice as far\r\nas you would have to do from Harper's Ferry. He is certainly not more\r\nthan half as well provided with wagons as you are. I certainly should be\r\npleased for you to have the advantage of the railroad from Harper's Perry\r\nto Winchester; but it wastes an the remainder of autumn to give it to you,\r\nand, in fact, ignores the question of time, which cannot and must not be\r\nignored.\r\n\r\nAgain, one of the standard maxims of war, as you know, is \"to operate\r\nupon the enemy's communications as much as possible, without exposing your\r\nown.\" You seem to act as if this applies against you, but cannot apply in\r\nyour favor. Change positions with the enemy, and think you not he would\r\nbreak your communication with Richmond within the next twenty-four hours?\r\nYou dread his going into Pennsylvania. But if he does so in full force, he\r\ngives up his communications to you absolutely, and you have nothing to do\r\nbut to follow and ruin him; if he does so with less than full force, fall\r\nupon and beat what is left behind all the easier.\r\n\r\nExclusive of the water line, you are now nearer to Richmond than the enemy\r\nis, by the route that you can and he must take. Why can you not reach\r\nthere before him, unless you admit that he is more than your equal on a\r\nmarch? His route is the arc of a circle, while yours is the chord. The\r\nroads are as good on yours as on his.\r\n\r\nYou know I desired, but did not order, you to cross the Potomac below\r\ninstead of above the Shenandoah and Blue Ridge. My idea was, that this\r\nwould at once menace the enemy's communications, which I would seize if\r\nhe would permit. If he should move northward, I would follow him\r\nclosely, holding his communications. If he should prevent our seizing his\r\ncommunications, and move toward Richmond, I would press closely to him,\r\nfight him if a favorable opportunity should present, and at least try to\r\nbeat him to Richmond on the inside track. I say \"try;\" if we never try,\r\nwe shall never succeed. If he makes a stand at Winchester, moving neither\r\nnorth or south, I would fight him there, on the idea that if we cannot\r\nbeat him when he bears the wastage of coming to us, we never can when we\r\nbear the wastage of going to him. This proposition is a simple truth,\r\nand is too important to be lost sight of for a moment. In coming to us\r\nhe tenders us an advantage which we should not waive. We should not so\r\noperate as to merely drive him away. As we must beat him somewhere or fail\r\nfinally, we can do it, if at all, easier near to us than far away. If we\r\ncannot beat the enemy where he now is, we never can, he again being within\r\nthe entrenchments of Richmond.\r\n\r\n[And, indeed, the enemy was let back into Richmond and it took another two\r\nyears and thousands of dead for McClelland cowardice--if that was all that\r\nit was. I still suspect, and I think the evidence is overwhelming that he\r\nwas, either secretly a supporter of the South, or, what is more likely,\r\na politician readying for a different campaign: that of the Presidency of\r\nthe United States.]\r\n\r\nRecurring to the idea of going to Richmond on the inside track, the\r\nfacility of supplying from the side away from the enemy is remarkable, as\r\nit were, by the different spokes of a wheel extending from the hub toward\r\nthe rim, and this whether you move directly by the chord or on the inside\r\narc, hugging the Blue Ridge more closely. The chord line, as you see,\r\ncarries you by Aldie, Hay Market, and Fredericksburg; and you see how\r\nturnpikes, railroads, and finally the Potomac, by Aquia Creek, meet you at\r\nall points from WASHINGTON; the same, only the lines lengthened a little,\r\nif you press closer to the Blue Ridge part of the way.\r\n\r\nThe gaps through the Blue Ridge I understand to be about the following\r\ndistances from Harper's Ferry, to wit: Vestal's, 5 miles; Gregory's, 13;\r\nSnicker's, 18; Ashby's, 28; Manassas, 38; Chester, 45; and Thornton's,\r\n53. I should think it preferable to take the route nearest the enemy,\r\ndisabling him to make an important move without your knowledge, and\r\ncompelling him to keep his forces together for dread of you. The gaps\r\nwould enable you to attack if you should wish. For a great part of the\r\nway you would be practically between the enemy and both WASHINGTON and\r\nRichmond, enabling us to spare you the greatest number of troops from\r\nhere. When at length running for Richmond ahead of him enables him to\r\nmove this way, if he does so, turn and attack him in rear. But I think he\r\nshould be engaged long before such a point is reached. It is all easy\r\nif our troops march as well as the enemy, and it is unmanly to say they\r\ncannot do it. This letter is in no sense an order.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR PIERPOINT.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., October 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR PIERPOINT, Wheeling, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day received. I am very sorry to have offended you. I\r\nappointed the collector, as I thought, on your written recommendation, and\r\nthe assessor also with your testimony of worthiness, although I know you\r\npreferred a different man. I will examine to-morrow whether I am mistaken\r\nin this.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING A PROVISIONAL COURT IN LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY,\r\n\r\nOctober 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection which has for some time prevailed in several of the\r\nStates of this Union, including Louisiana, having temporarily subverted\r\nand swept away the civil institutions of that State, including the\r\njudiciary and the judicial authorities of the Union, so that it has\r\nbecome necessary to hold the State in military Occupation, and it being\r\nindispensably necessary that there shall be some judicial tribunal\r\nexisting there capable of administering justice, I have therefore thought\r\nit proper to appoint, and I do hereby constitute, a provisional court,\r\nwhich shall be a court of record, for the State of Louisiana; and I do\r\nhereby appoint Charles A Peabody, of New York, to be a provisional judge\r\nto hold said court, with authority to hear, try, and determine all\r\ncauses, civil and criminal, including causes in law, equity, revenue, and\r\nadmiralty, and particularly all such powers and jurisdiction as belong\r\nto the district and circuit courts of the United States, conforming his\r\nproceedings so far as possible to the course of proceedings and practice\r\nwhich has been customary in the courts of the United States and Louisiana,\r\nhis judgment to be final and conclusive. And I do hereby authorize and\r\nempower the said judge to make and establish such rules and regulations\r\nas may be necessary for the exercise of his jurisdiction, and empower the\r\nsaid judge to appoint a prosecuting attorney, marshal, and clerk of the\r\nsaid court, who shall perform the functions of attorney, marshal, and\r\nclerk according to such proceedings and practice as before mentioned and\r\nsuch rules and regulations as may be made and established by said judge.\r\nThese appointments are to continue during the pleasure of the President,\r\nnot extending beyond the military occupation of the city of New Orleans\r\nor the restoration of the civil authority in that city and in the State of\r\nLouisiana. These officers shall be paid, out of the contingent fund of the\r\nWar Department, compensation as follows:\r\n\r\nThe judge at the rate of $3500 per annum; the prosecuting attorney,\r\nincluding the fees, at the rate of $3000 per annum; the marshal, including\r\nthe fees, at the rate of $3000 per annum; and the clerk, including the\r\nfees, at the rate of $2500 per annum; such compensations to be certified\r\nby the Secretary of War. A copy of this order, certified by the Secretary\r\nof War and delivered to such judge, shall be deemed and held to be a\r\nsufficient commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nOctober 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL U. S. GRANT:\r\n\r\nThe bearer of this, Thomas R. Smith, a citizen of Tennessee, goes to that\r\nState seeking to have such of the people thereof as desire to avoid the\r\nunsatisfactory prospect before them, and to have peace again upon the\r\nold terms, under the Constitution of the United States, to manifest\r\nsuch desire by elections of members to the Congress of the United States\r\nparticularly, and perhaps a Legislature, State officers, and a United\r\nStates senator friendly to their object.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad for you and each of you to aid him, and all others acting\r\nfor this object, as much as possible. In all available ways give the\r\npeople a show to express their wishes at these elections.\r\n\r\nFollow law, and forms of law, as far as convenient, but at all events get\r\nthe expression of the largest number of the people possible. All see how\r\nsuch action will connect with and affect the proclamation of September\r\n22. Of course the men elected should be gentlemen of character, willing\r\nto swear support to the Constitution as of old, and known to be above\r\nreasonable suspicion of duplicity.\r\n\r\nYours very respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL JAMESON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL JAMESON, Upper Stillwater, Me.:\r\n\r\nHow is your health now? Do you or not wish Lieut. R. P. Crawford to be\r\nrestored to his office?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN'S TIRED HORSES\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, October 24 [25?], 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI have just read your despatch about sore-tongued and fatigued horses.\r\nWill you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since\r\nthe battle of Antietam that fatigues anything?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, October 26, 1862. 11.30am\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours, in reply to mine about horses, received. Of course you know the\r\nfacts better than I; still two considerations remain: Stuart's cavalry\r\noutmarched ours, having certainly done more marked service on the\r\nPeninsula and everywhere since. Secondly, will not a movement of our army\r\nbe a relief to the cavalry, compelling the enemy to concentrate instead\r\nof foraging in squads everywhere? But I am so rejoiced to learn from\r\nyour despatch to General Halleck that you begin crossing the river this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DIX.\r\n\r\n(Private and confidential.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON October 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour despatch to Mr. Stanton, of which the enclosed is a copy, has been\r\nhanded me by him. It would be dangerous for me now to begin construing and\r\nmaking specific applications of the proclamation.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious to all that I therein intended to give time and opportunity.\r\nAlso, it is seen I left myself at liberty to exempt parts of States.\r\nWithout saying more, I shall be very glad if any Congressional district\r\nwill, in good faith, do as your despatch contemplates.\r\n\r\nCould you give me the facts which prompted you to telegraph?\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 27, 1862, 12.10\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday received. Most certainly I intend no injustice to any,\r\nand if I have done any I deeply regret it. To be told, after more than\r\nfive weeks' total inaction of the army, and during which period we have\r\nsent to the army every fresh horse we possibly could, amounting in the\r\nwhole to 7918, that the cavalry horses were too much fatigued to move,\r\npresents a very cheerless, almost hopeless, prospect for the future,\r\nand it may have forced something of impatience in my despatch. If not\r\nrecruited and rested then, when could they ever be? I suppose the river is\r\nrising, and I am glad to believe you are crossing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 27, 1862. 3.25pm\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of 3 P.M. to-day, in regard to filling up old regiments with\r\ndrafted men, is received, and the request therein shall be complied with\r\nas far as practicable.\r\n\r\nAnd now I ask a distinct answer to the question, Is it your purpose not\r\nto go into action again until the men now being drafted in the States are\r\nincorporated into the old regiments?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 29, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatches of night before last, yesterday, and last night all\r\nreceived. I am much pleased with the movement of the army. When you get\r\nentirely across the river let me know. What do you know of the enemy?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg:\r\n\r\nBy some means I have not seen your despatch of the 27th about order No.154\r\nuntil this moment. I now learn, what I knew nothing of before, that the\r\nhistory of the order is as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen General McClellan telegraphed asking General Halleck to have the\r\norder made, General Halleck went to the Secretary of War with it, stating\r\nhis approval of the plan. The Secretary assented and General Halleck wrote\r\nthe order. It was a military question, which the Secretary supposed the\r\nGeneral understood better than he.\r\n\r\nI wish I could see Governor Curtin.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 31, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOV. ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tenn., via Louisville, Ky.:\r\n\r\nYours of the 29th received. I shall take it to General Halleck, but I\r\nalready know it will be inconvenient to take General Morgan's command from\r\nwhere it now is. I am glad to hear you speak hopefully of Tennessee. I\r\nsincerely hope Rosecrans may find it possible to do something for her.\r\nDavid Nelson, son of the M. C. of your State, regrets his father's final\r\ndefection, and asks me for a situation. Do you know him? Could he be of\r\nservice to you or to Tennessee in any capacity in which I could send him?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: Captain Derrickson, with his company, has been for\r\nsome time keeping guard at my residence, now at the Soldiers' Retreat. He\r\nand his company are very agreeable to me, and while it is deemed proper\r\nfor any guard to remain, none would be more satisfactory than Captain\r\nDerrickson and his company.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nAND MAKING OTHER CHANGES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, November 5, 1862.\r\n\r\nBy direction of the President, it is ordered that Major-General McClellan\r\nbe relieved from the command of the Army of the Potomac, and that\r\nMajor-General Burnside take the command of that army. Also that\r\nMajor-General Hunter take command of the corps in said army which is now\r\ncommanded by General Burnside. That Major-General Fitz. John Porter be\r\nrelieved from command of the corps he now commands in said army, and that\r\nMajor-General Hooker take command of said corps.\r\n\r\nThe general-in-chief is authorized, in [his] discretion, to issue an order\r\nsubstantially as the above forthwith, or so soon as he may deem proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Please forward as soon as possible the full and complete record\r\nof their convictions; and if the record does not fully indicate the more\r\nguilty and influential of the culprits, please have a careful statement\r\nmade on these points and forwarded to me.

He is in command of\r\na considerable land force for operating in the South, and I shall be glad\r\nfor you to co-Operate with him and give him such assistance as you can\r\nconsistently with your orders from the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING BLOCKADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered, First: that clearances issued by the Treasury Department for\r\nvessels or merchandise bound for the port of Norfolk, for the military\r\nnecessities of the department, certified by the military commandant at\r\nFort Monroe, shall be allowed to enter said port.\r\n\r\nSecond: that vessels and domestic produce from Norfolk, permitted by\r\nthe military commandant at Fort Monroe for the military purposes of his\r\ncommand, shall on his permit be allowed to pass from said port to their\r\ndestination in any port not blockaded by the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE CONFISCATION ACT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, November 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered, by the President of the United States, That the Attorney-General\r\nbe charged with the superintendence and direction of all proceedings to be\r\nhad under the act of Congress of the 17th of July, 1862, entitled \"An act\r\nto suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and\r\nconfiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,\" in so far\r\nas may concern the seizure, prosecution, and condemnation of the estate,\r\nproperty, and effects of rebels and traitors, as mentioned and provided\r\nfor in the fifth, sixth, and seventh sections of the said act of Congress.\r\nAnd the Attorney-General is authorized and required to give to the\r\nattorneys and marshals of the United States such instructions and\r\ndirections as he may find needful and convenient touching all such\r\nseizures, prosecutions, and condemnations, and, moreover, to authorize all\r\nsuch attorneys and marshals, whenever there may be reasonable ground to\r\nfear any forcible resistance to them in the discharge of their respective\r\nduties in this behalf, to call upon any military officer in command of\r\nthe forces of the United States to give to them such aid, protection,\r\nand support as may be necessary to enable them safely and efficiently to\r\ndischarge their respective duties; and all such commanding officers are\r\nrequired promptly to obey such call, and to render the necessary service\r\nas far as may be in their power consistently with their other duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  EDWARD BATES, Attorney-General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, November 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOV. ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of the 4th, about returning troops from western Virginia to\r\nTennessee, is just received, and I have been to General Halleck with it.\r\nHe says an order has already been made by which those troops have already\r\nmoved, or soon will move, to Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDER RESPECTING THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH DAY\r\n\r\nIN THE ARMY AND NAVY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 15, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, desires and\r\nenjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath by the officers and men in\r\nthe military and naval service. The importance for man and beast of\r\nthe prescribed weekly rest, the sacred rights of Christian soldiers and\r\nsailors, a becoming deference to the best sentiment of a Christian people,\r\nand a due regard for the divine will demand that Sunday labor in the army\r\nand navy be reduced to the measure of strict necessity.\r\n\r\nThe discipline and character of the national forces should not suffer nor\r\nthe cause they defend be imperilled by the profanation of the day or name\r\nof the Most High. \"At this time of public distress,\" adopting the words of\r\nWashington in 1776, \"men may find enough to do in the service of God and\r\ntheir country without abandoning themselves to vice and immorality.\"\r\nThe first general order issued by the Father of his Country after the\r\nDeclaration of Independence indicates the spirit in which our institutions\r\nwere founded and should ever be defended:\r\n\r\n\"The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to\r\nlive and act as becomes a Christian soldier defending the dearest rights\r\nand liberties of his country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

BLAIR:\r\n\r\nYour brother says you are solicitous to be ordered to join General\r\nMcLernand. I suppose you are ordered to Helena; this means that you are\r\nto form part of McLernand's expedition as it moves down the river; and\r\nGeneral McLernand is so informed. I will see General Halleck as to whether\r\nthe additional force you mention can go with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., November 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe:\r\n\r\nPlease give me your best opinion as to the number of the enemy now at\r\nRichmond and also at Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SHEPLEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. G. F. SHEPLEY.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Dr. Kennedy, bearer of this, has some apprehension that\r\nFederal officers not citizens of Louisiana may be set up as candidates for\r\nCongress in that State. In my view there could be no possible object in\r\nsuch an election. We do not particularly need members of Congress from\r\nthere to enable us to get along with legislation here. What we do want is\r\nthe conclusive evidence that respectable citizens of Louisiana are willing\r\nto be members of Congress and to swear support to the Constitution, and\r\nthat other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and\r\nsend them. To send a parcel of Northern men here as representatives,\r\nelected, as would be understood (and perhaps really so), at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, would be disgusting and outrageous; and were I a member of\r\nCongress here, I would vote against admitting any such man to a seat.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER PROHIBITING THE EXPORT OF ARMS AND MUNITIONS OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nNovember 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That no arms, ammunition, or munitions of war be cleared or\r\nallowed to be exported from the United States until further orders. That\r\nany clearance for arms, ammunition, or munitions of war issued heretofore\r\nby the Treasury Department be vacated, if the articles have not passed\r\nwithout the United States, and the articles stopped. That the Secretary\r\nof War hold possession of the arms, etc., recently seized by his order at\r\nRouse's Point, bound for Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAYING TACTICS OF GENERALS\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL BANKS:--Early last week you left me in high hope with your\r\nassurance that you would be off with your expedition at the end of that\r\nweek, or early in this. It is now the end of this, and I have just been\r\noverwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you\r\nwhich, I am assured, cannot be filled and got off within an hour short of\r\ntwo months. I enclose you a copy of the requisition, in some hope that\r\nit is not genuine--that you have never seen it. My dear General, this\r\nexpanding and piling up of impedimenta has been, so far, almost our ruin,\r\nand will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned. If you had the articles\r\nof this requisition upon the wharf, with the necessary animals to make\r\nthem of any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get vessels\r\ntogether in two weeks to carry the whole, to say nothing of your twenty\r\nthousand men; and, having the vessels, you could not put the cargoes\r\naboard in two weeks more. And, after all, where you are going you have no\r\nuse for them. When you parted with me you had no such ideas in your mind.\r\nI know you had not, or you could not have expected to be off so soon as\r\nyou said. You must get back to something like the plan you had then, or\r\nyour expedition is a failure before you start. You must be off before\r\nCongress meets. You would be better off anywhere, and especially where\r\nyou are going, for not having a thousand wagons doing nothing but hauling\r\nforage to feed the animals that draw them, and taking at least two\r\nthousand men to care for the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be\r\ntwo thousand good soldiers. Now, dear General, do not think this is an\r\nill-natured letter; it is the very reverse. The simple publication of this\r\nrequisition would ruin you.\r\n\r\nVery truly your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--I have just received and read your letter of the 20th. The\r\npurport of it is that we lost the late elections and the administration\r\nis failing because the war is unsuccessful, and that I must not flatter\r\nmyself that I am not justly to blame for it. I certainly know that if\r\nthe war fails the administration fails, and that I will be blamed for\r\nit, whether I deserve it or not. And I ought to be blamed if I could do\r\nbetter. You think I could do better; therefore you blame me already.\r\nI think I could not do better; therefore I blame you for blaming me. I\r\nunderstand you now to be willing to accept the help of men who are not\r\nRepublicans, provided they have \"heart in it.\" Agreed. I want no others.\r\nBut who is to be the judge of hearts, or of \"heart in it\"? If I must\r\ndiscard my own judgment and take yours, I must also take that of others\r\nand by the time I should reject all I should be advised to reject, I\r\nshould have none left, Republicans or others not even yourself. For be\r\nassured, my dear sir, there are men who have \"heart in it\" that think you\r\nare performing your part as poorly as you think I am performing mine. I\r\ncertainly have been dissatisfied with the slowness of Buell and McClellan;\r\nbut before I relieved them I had great fears I should not find successors\r\nto them who would do better; and I am sorry to add that I have seen little\r\nsince to relieve those fears.\r\n\r\nI do not see clearly the prospect of any more rapid movements. I fear we\r\nshall at last find out that the difficulty is in our case rather than in\r\nparticular generals. I wish to disparage no one certainly not those\r\nwho sympathize with me; but I must say I need success more than I need\r\nsympathy, and that I have not seen the so much greater evidence of getting\r\nsuccess from my sympathizers than from those who are denounced as the\r\ncontrary. It does seem to me that in the field the two classes have been\r\nvery much alike in what they have done and what they have failed to do.\r\nIn sealing their faith with their blood, Baker and Lyon and Bohien and\r\nRichardson, Republicans, did all that men could do; but did they any\r\nmore than Kearny and Stevens and Reno and Mansfield, none of whom were\r\nRepublicans, and some at least of whom have been bitterly and repeatedly\r\ndenounced to me as secession sympathizers? I will not perform the\r\nungrateful task of comparing cases of failure.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your question, \"Has it not been publicly stated in the\r\nnewspapers, and apparently proved as a fact, that from the commencement of\r\nthe war the enemy was continually supplied with information by some of the\r\nconfidential subordinates of as important an officer as Adjutant-General\r\nThomas?\" I must say \"No,\" as far as my knowledge extends. And I add that\r\nif you can give any tangible evidence upon the subject, I will thank you\r\nto come to this city and do so.\r\n\r\nVery truly your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Falmouth, Virginia:\r\n\r\nIf I should be in boat off Aquia Creek at dark tomorrow (Wednesday)\r\nevening, could you, without inconvenience, meet me and pass an hour or two\r\nwith me?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTORNEY-GENERAL BATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nNovember 29, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. ATTORNEY-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Few things perplex me more than this question between\r\nGovernor Gamble and the War Department, as to whether the peculiar force\r\norganized by the former in Missouri are State troops or United States\r\ntroops. Now, this is either an immaterial or a mischievous question.\r\nFirst, if no more is desired than to have it settled what name the force\r\nis to be called by, it is immaterial. Secondly, if it is desired for more\r\nthan the fixing a name, it can only be to get a position from which to\r\ndraw practical inferences; then it is mischievous. Instead of settling one\r\ndispute by deciding the question, I should merely furnish a nest-full of\r\neggs for hatching new disputes. I believe the force is not strictly either\r\n\"State troops\" or \"United States troops.\" It is of mixed character. I\r\ntherefore think it is safer, when a practical question arises, to\r\ndecide that question directly, and not indirectly by deciding a general\r\nabstraction supposed to include it, and also including a great deal more.\r\nWithout dispute Governor Gamble appoints the officers of this force, and\r\nfills vacancies when they occur. The question now practically in dispute\r\nis: Can Governor Gamble make a vacancy by removing an officer or accepting\r\na resignation? Now, while it is proper that this question shall be\r\nsettled, I do not perceive why either Governor Gamble or the government\r\nhere should care which way it is settled. I am perplexed with it only\r\nbecause there seems to be pertinacity about it. It seems to me that it\r\nmight be either way without injury to the service; or that the offer of\r\nthe Secretary of War to let Governor Gamble make vacancies, and he (the\r\nSecretary) to ratify the making of them, ought to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, Saint Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nFrank Blair wants Manter's Thirty-second, Curly's Twenty seventh, Boyd's\r\nTwenty-fourth and the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry to go with him down the\r\nriver. I understand it is with you to decide whether he shall have them\r\nand if so, and if also it is consistent with the public service, you will\r\noblige me a good deal by letting him have them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON EXECUTING 300 INDIANS\r\n\r\nLETTER TO JUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nJUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Three hundred Indians have been sentenced to death in Minnesota by\r\na military commission, and execution only awaits my action. I wish your\r\nlegal opinion whether if I should conclude to execute only a part of them,\r\nI must myself designate which, or could I leave the designation to some\r\nofficer on the ground?\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS, DECEMBER 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES--Since your\r\nlast annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests\r\nhas passed; and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a\r\nreturn of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light he gives\r\nus, trusting that in his own good time and wise way all will yet be well.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during\r\nthe last year is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request\r\nto that effect, made by the House of Representatives near the close of the\r\nlast session of Congress.\r\n\r\nIf the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying\r\nthan it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more\r\nsatisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might\r\nreasonably have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some\r\ngrounds to expect that the maritime powers which, at the beginning of\r\nour domestic difficulties, so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think,\r\nrecognized the insurgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from that\r\nposition, which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to\r\nour own country. But the temporary reverses which afterward befell the\r\nnational arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens\r\nabroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice.\r\n\r\nThe civil war, which has so radically changed, for the moment, the\r\noccupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed\r\nthe social condition, and affected very deeply the prosperity, of the\r\nnations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily\r\nincreasing throughout a period of half a century. It has, at the same\r\ntime, excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced\r\na profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual\r\nagitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between\r\nforeign states, and between parties or factions in such states. We have\r\nattempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution, but we have left\r\nto every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs.\r\nOur struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign nations\r\nwith reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often\r\nexaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations\r\nthemselves, nevertheless, complaint on the part of this government, even\r\nif it were just, would certainly be unwise.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has\r\nbeen put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is\r\nan occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it\r\non the part of her Majesty's government has been marked with a jealous\r\nrespect for the authority of the United States and the rights of their\r\nmoral and loyal citizens.\r\n\r\nThe convention with Hanover for the abolition of the state dues has been\r\ncarried into full effect under the act of Congress for that purpose.\r\n\r\nA blockade of 3000 miles of seacoast could not be established and\r\nvigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like\r\nthe present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting\r\nunintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects.\r\n\r\nA civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on\r\ntrade under treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints\r\nof the violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite\r\nmisapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between\r\nnations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship.\r\nIn clear cases of these kinds I have so far as possible heard and\r\nredressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers. There\r\nis still, however, a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases\r\nupon which the government is unable to agree with the governments whose\r\nprotection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases\r\nin which the United States or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval\r\nor military authorities of foreign nations which the governments of those\r\nstates are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the\r\nforeign states thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust\r\nsuch complaints. This proposition has been made especially to Great\r\nBritain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been\r\nkindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of\r\nthe Norwegian bark Admiral P. Tordenskiold, which vessel was in May, 1861,\r\nprevented by the commander of the blockading force off Charleston from\r\nleaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had\r\nshortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have directed the\r\nSecretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to\r\nthe proper committees.\r\n\r\nApplications have been made to me by many free Americans of African\r\ndescent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as\r\nwas contemplated in recent acts of Congress, Other parties, at home\r\nand abroad--some from interested motives, others upon patriotic\r\nconsiderations, and still others influenced by philanthropic\r\nsentiments--have suggested similar measures, while, on the other hand,\r\nseveral of the Spanish American republics have protested against the\r\nsending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these\r\ncircumstances I have declined to move any such colony to any state without\r\nfirst obtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement on its\r\npart to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen;\r\nand I have at the same time offered to the several states situated within\r\nthe Tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigration\r\nof persons of that class to their respective territories, upon conditions\r\nwhich shall be equal, just, and humane. Liberia and Haiti are as yet the\r\nonly countries to which colonists of African descent from here could go\r\nwith certainty of being received and adopted as citizens; and I regret\r\nto say such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to\r\nmigrate to those countries as to some others, nor so willing as I think\r\ntheir interest demands. I believe, however, opinion among them in this\r\nrespect is improving, and that ere long there will be an augmented and\r\nconsiderable migration to both these countries from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of\r\nTurkey has been carried into execution.\r\n\r\nA commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the\r\nSenate's consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending\r\nwith the Republic of Haiti. A considerable improvement of the national\r\ncommerce is expected to result from these measures.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia,\r\nPrussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the\r\nother European states remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also\r\ncontinue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year there has not only been no change of our previous\r\nrelations with the independent states of our own continent, but more\r\nfriendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to\r\nbe entertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress are so\r\nintimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to\r\nMexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile.\r\n\r\nThe commission under the convention with the Republic of New Granada\r\nclosed its session without having audited and passed upon all the claims\r\nwhich were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the\r\nconvention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The joint\r\ncommission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has\r\ncompleted its labors and submitted its report.\r\n\r\nI have favored the project for connecting the United States with Europe by\r\nan Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from\r\nSan Francisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the line which is\r\nbeing extended across the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have\r\nremained undisturbed by the civil war; and they are exhibiting such\r\nevidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will\r\nsoon be in a condition to be organized as States and be constitutionally\r\nadmitted into the Federal Union.\r\n\r\nThe immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be\r\ndeveloped as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have\r\na tendency to improve the revenues of the government and diminish the\r\nburdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious consideration whether\r\nsome extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted. The\r\nmeans which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific\r\nexploration of the mineral regions in those Territories with a view to the\r\npublication of its results at home and in foreign countries--results which\r\ncannot fail to be auspicious.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the finances win claim your most diligent consideration.\r\nThe vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations\r\nrequired for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with\r\na promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances, and the\r\npublic credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the war,\r\nhowever, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented\r\nforces now in the field demand your best reflections as to the best modes\r\nof providing the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the\r\nleast possible burdens upon labor.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement\r\nof your last session made large issues of United States notes unavoidable.\r\nIn no other way could the payment of troops and the satisfaction of other\r\njust demands be so economically or so well provided for. The judicious\r\nlegislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for\r\nloans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts,\r\nhas made them an universal currency, and has satisfied, partially at\r\nleast, and for the time, the long-felt want of an uniform circulating\r\nmedium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\nA return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible\r\nwith due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view.\r\nFluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce\r\nthese fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a\r\nleading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain\r\nconvertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and\r\nsurest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a\r\ncirculation of United States notes payable in coin and sufficiently large\r\nfor the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, and safely\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nIs there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the\r\npublic wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform\r\ncurrency secured?\r\n\r\nI know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time\r\nso unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations, under\r\na general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such\r\nassociations the government might furnish circulating notes, on the\r\nsecurity of United States bonds deposited in the treasury. These notes,\r\nprepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in\r\nappearance and security and convertible always into coin, would at once\r\nprotect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate\r\ncommerce by cheap and safe exchanges.\r\n\r\nA moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate\r\nthe United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes and\r\na general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of\r\nthat part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit,\r\nmoreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans\r\ngreatly facilitated by the steady market demand for government bonds which\r\nthe adoption of the proposed system would create.\r\n\r\nIt is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight,\r\nin my judgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing\r\ninterests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to\r\nreorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national\r\ncirculation for the local and various circulation, secured and unsecured,\r\nnow issued by them.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans and\r\nbalance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30th\r\nJune, 1862, were $583,885,247.06, of which sum $49,056,397.62 were derived\r\nfrom customs; $1,795,331.73 from the direct tax; from public lands,\r\n$152,203.77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787.64; from loans in all\r\nforms, $529,692,460.50. The remainder, $2,257,065.80, was the balance from\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nThe disbursements during the same period were: For congressional,\r\nexecutive, and judicial purposes, $5,939,009.29; for foreign intercourse,\r\n$1,339,710.35; for miscellaneous expenses, including the mints, loans,\r\npost-office deficiencies, collection of revenue, and other like charges,\r\n$14,129,771.50; for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,102,985.52;\r\nunder the War Department, $394,368,407.36; under the Navy Department,\r\n$42,674,569.69; for interest on public debt, $13,190,324.45; and for\r\npayment of public debt, including reimbursement of temporary loan and\r\nredemptions, $96,096,922.09; making an aggregate of $570,841,700.25,\r\nand leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of July, 1862, of\r\n$13,043,546.81.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922.09, expended for\r\nreimbursements and redemption of public debt, being included also in the\r\nloans made, may be properly deducted both from receipts and expenditures,\r\nleaving the actual receipts for the year $487,788,324.97, and the\r\nexpenditures $474,744,778.16.\r\n\r\nOther information on the subject of the finances will be found in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statements and views I\r\ninvite your most candid and considerate attention.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are herewith\r\ntransmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief\r\nabstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations\r\nconducted through those departments. Nor could I give a summary of them\r\nhere upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than\r\nthe reports themselves. I therefore content myself with laying the reports\r\nbefore you and asking your attention to them.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial\r\ncondition of the Post-Office Department as compared with several preceding\r\nyears. The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to $8,349,296.40,\r\nwhich embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three\r\nquarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the\r\nso-called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of\r\nthe correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a\r\nrevenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90, being only $50,000 less\r\nthan was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous\r\nyear. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount\r\nexpended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11. For the last year the amount has been\r\nreduced to $11,125,364.13, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the\r\nexpenditures as compared with the preceding year, and about $3,750,000 as\r\ncompared with the fiscal year 1860. The deficiency in the department\r\nfor the previous year was $4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal year it was\r\nreduced to $2,112,814.57. These favorable results are in part owing to the\r\ncessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States and in part to a\r\ncareful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of\r\neconomy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has\r\nalso been much improved. The Postmaster-General has also opened a\r\ncorrespondence through the Department of State with foreign governments\r\nproposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of\r\nsimplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign\r\nmails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to\r\nthe commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained\r\nand agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received.\r\n\r\nI ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the\r\nPostmaster-General in his report respecting the further legislation\r\nrequired, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the public\r\nlands:\r\n\r\n\"The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. From the 1st\r\nJuly, 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, the entire cash receipts from the\r\nsale of lands were $137,476.2--a sum much less than the expenses of our\r\nland system during the same period. The homestead law, which will take\r\neffect on the 1st of January next, offers such inducements to settlers\r\nthat sales for cash cannot be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the\r\nexpenses of the General Land Office and the cost of surveying and bringing\r\nthe land into market.\"\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of\r\nthe public lands and the sum derived from the same source as reported from\r\nthe Treasury Department arises, as I understand, from the fact that the\r\nperiods of time, though apparently were not really coincident at the\r\nbeginning point, the Treasury report including a considerable sum now\r\nwhich had previously been reported from the Interior, sufficiently large\r\nto greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported\r\nupon by the Interior and not by the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year manifested\r\na spirit of insubordination, and at several points have engaged in open\r\nhostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity. The tribes\r\noccupying the Indian country south of Kansas renounced their allegiance to\r\nthe United States and entered into treaties with the insurgents. Those\r\nwho remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country. The\r\nchief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring\r\nthe former relations of the tribe with the United States. He alleges that\r\nthey were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the\r\ninsurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection\r\nwhich their treaty stipulations required.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August last the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked\r\nthe settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing\r\nindiscriminately men, women, and children. This attack was wholly\r\nunexpected, and therefore no means of defense had been provided. It is\r\nestimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the Indians, and\r\na large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is\r\nnot definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust, need not to\r\nbe stated. Information was received by the Indian Bureau from different\r\nsources about the time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous\r\nattack was to be made upon white settlements by all the tribes between\r\nthe Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. The State of Minnesota\r\nhas suffered great injury from this Indian war. A large portion of her\r\nterritory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained\r\nby the destruction of property. The people of that State manifest much\r\nanxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of the State as\r\na guaranty against future hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs\r\nwill furnish full details. I submit for your especial consideration\r\nwhether our Indian system shall not be remodeled. Many wise and good men\r\nhave impressed me with the belief that this can be profitably done.\r\n\r\nI submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which shows the\r\nprogress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the Pacific\r\nRailroad. And this suggests the earliest completion of this road, and also\r\nthe favorable action of Congress upon the projects now pending before them\r\nfor enlarging the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois,\r\nas being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation,\r\nand especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at\r\nsome greater length. I purpose having prepared and laid before you at an\r\nearly day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this\r\nsubject. The military and commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois\r\nand Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois River is presented in the\r\nreport of Colonel Webster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to\r\nCongress. I respectfully ask attention to it.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May\r\nlast, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States to\r\nbe organized.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this\r\ndepartment has established an extensive system of correspondence and\r\nexchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly\r\nbeneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent\r\nimprovements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and in\r\nthe collection of the agricultural statistics of the different States.\r\n\r\nAlso, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds, cereals,\r\nplants, and cuttings, and has already published and liberally diffused\r\nmuch valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report,\r\nwhich will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in\r\nchemical science now in progress in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a\r\nlarge class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the\r\nliberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your\r\napprobation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest\r\nanticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful source\r\nof advantage to all our people.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of September last a proclamation was issued by the\r\nExecutive, a copy of which is herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that\r\npaper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called\r\n\"compensated emancipation.\"\r\n\r\nA nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its\r\nlaws. The territory is the only part which is of certain durability.\r\n\"One generation passeth away and another generation cometh, but the earth\r\nabideth forever.\" It is of the first importance to duly consider and\r\nestimate this ever enduring part. That portion of the earth's surface\r\nwhich is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States is well\r\nadapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not well\r\nadapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of climate and\r\nproductions are of advantage in this age for one people, whatever they\r\nmight have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence have\r\nbrought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people.\r\n\r\nIn the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of\r\ndisunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the\r\ntwo sections. I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which,\r\ntherefore, I beg to repeat:\r\n\r\n\"One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to\r\nbe extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be\r\nextended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave clause\r\nof the Constitution and the laws for the suppression of the foreign slave\r\ntrade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a\r\ncommunity where the moral Sense of the people imperfectly supports the law\r\nitself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\r\nin both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be\r\nperfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation\r\nof the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly\r\nsuppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one\r\nsection, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not\r\nbe surrendered at all by the other.\r\n\r\n\"Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our\r\nrespective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between\r\nthem. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and\r\nbeyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country\r\ncannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse,\r\neither amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible,\r\nthen, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory\r\nafter separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends\r\ncan make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens\r\nthan laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight\r\nalways; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you\r\ncease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse,\r\nare again upon you.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary\r\nupon which to divide. Trace through, from east to west, upon the line\r\nbetween the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than\r\none third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated,\r\nor soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its\r\nremaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk\r\nback and forth without any consciousness of their presence. No part of\r\nthis line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on\r\npaper or parchment as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it\r\ncomes, gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive-slave\r\nclause along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section\r\nseceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be\r\nmade to take its place.\r\n\r\nBut there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded east\r\nby the Alleghenies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky\r\nMountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and\r\ncotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee,\r\nall of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri,\r\nKansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part\r\nof Colorado, already has above 10,000,000 people, and will have 50,000,000\r\nwithin fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake.\r\nIt contains more than one third of the country owned by the United\r\nStates--certainly more than 1,000,000 square miles. Once half as populous\r\nas Massachusetts already is, it would have more than 75,000,000 people. A\r\nglance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great\r\nbody of the Republic. The other parts are but marginal borders to it, the\r\nmagnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific\r\nbeing the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources. In the\r\nproduction of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from them\r\nthis great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the\r\nworld. Ascertain from statistics the small proportion of the region which\r\nhas yet been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly\r\nincreasing amount of products, and we shall be overwhelmed with\r\nthe magnitude of the prospect presented. And yet this region has no\r\nseacoast--touches no ocean anywhere. As part of one nation, its people\r\nnow find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York, to South\r\nAmerica and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco; but\r\nseparate our common country into two nations, as designed by the present\r\nrebellion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off\r\nfrom some one or more of these outlets, not perhaps by a physical barrier,\r\nbut by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.\r\n\r\nAnd this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed. Place\r\nit between the now free and slave country, or place it south of Kentucky\r\nor north of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none south of it can\r\ntrade to any port or place north of it, and none north of it can trade to\r\nany port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by a government\r\nforeign to them. These outlets, east, west, and south, are indispensable\r\nto the well-being of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast\r\ninterior region. Which of the three may be the best is no proper question.\r\nAll are better than either, and all of right belong to that people and to\r\ntheir successors forever. True to themselves, they will not ask where a\r\nline of separation shall be, but will vow rather that there shall be no\r\nsuch line.\r\n\r\nNor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to\r\nand through them to the great outside world. They, too, and each of them,\r\nmust have access to this Egypt of the West without paying toll at the\r\ncrossing of any national boundary.\r\n\r\nOur national strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the land\r\nwe inhabit; not from our national homestead. There is no possible severing\r\nof this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In all its\r\nadaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separation. In fact,\r\nit would ere long force reunion, however much of blood and treasure the\r\nseparation might have cost.\r\n\r\nOur strife pertains to ourselves--to the passing generations of men--and\r\nit can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIn this view I recommend the adoption of the following resolution and\r\narticles amendatory to the Constitution of the United States:\r\n\r\nResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States\r\nof America, in Congress assembled, (two thirds of both Houses concurring),\r\nThat the following articles be proposed to the Legislatures (or\r\nconventions) of the several States as amendments to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, all or any of which articles, when ratified by three\r\nfourths of the said Legislatures (or conventions), to be valid as part or\r\nparts of the said Constitution, viz.\r\n\r\nART.--Every State wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish the same\r\ntherein at any time or times before the 1st day of January, A.D. 1900,\r\nshall receive compensation from the United States as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States shall deliver to every such State bonds\r\nof the United States bearing interest at the rate of -- per cent. per\r\nannum to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of ------ for each slave\r\nshown to have been therein by the Eighth Census of the United States, said\r\nbonds to be delivered to such State by instalments or in one parcel at\r\nthe completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same shall have been\r\ngradual or at one time within such State; and interest shall begin to run\r\nupon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid.\r\nAny State having received bonds as aforesaid and afterwards reintroducing\r\nor tolerating slavery therein shall refund to the United States the bonds\r\nso received, or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon.\r\n\r\nART.--All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of\r\nthe war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever\r\nfree; but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall be\r\ncompensated for them at the same rates as is provided for States adopting\r\nabolishment of slavery, but in such way that no slave shall be twice\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\nART.--Congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonizing\r\nfree colored persons with their own consent at any place or places without\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nI beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length.\r\nWithout slavery the rebellion could never have existed; without slavery it\r\ncould not continue.\r\n\r\nAmong the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment and\r\nof policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst us. Some\r\nwould perpetuate slavery; some would abolish it suddenly and without\r\ncompensation; some would abolish it gradually and with compensation; some\r\nwould remove the freed people from us, and some would retain them with us;\r\nand there are yet other minor diversities. Because of these diversities we\r\nwaste much strength in struggles among ourselves. By mutual concession we\r\nshould harmonize and act together. This would be compromise, but it would\r\nbe compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the Union.\r\nThese articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions.\r\nIf the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow,\r\nat least in several of the States.\r\n\r\nAs to the first article, the main points are, first, the emancipation;\r\nsecondly, the length of time for consummating it (thirty-seven years);\r\nand, thirdly, the compensation.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual\r\nslavery, but the length of time should greatly mitigate their\r\ndissatisfaction. The time spares both races from the evils of sudden\r\nderangement--in fact, from the necessity of any derangement--while most\r\nof those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure\r\nwill have passed away before its consummation. They will never see it.\r\nAnother class will hail the prospect of emancipation, but will deprecate\r\nthe length of time. They will feel that it gives too little to the now\r\nliving slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them from the\r\nvagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in\r\nlocalities where their numbers are very great, and it gives the inspiring\r\nassurance that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to\r\neach State choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end\r\nof the century, or at any intermediate tune, or by degrees extending\r\nover the whole or any part of the period, and it obliges no two States to\r\nproceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and generally the\r\nmode of making it. This, it would seem, must further mitigate the\r\ndissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery, and especially of\r\nthose who are to receive the compensation. Doubtless some of those who are\r\nto pay and not to receive will object. Yet the measure is both just and\r\neconomical. In a certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction\r\nof property--property acquired by descent or by purchase, the same as any\r\nother property. It is no less true for having been often said that the\r\npeople of the South are not more responsible for the original introduction\r\nof this property than are the people of the North; and when it is\r\nremembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar and share the\r\nprofits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the South\r\nhas been more responsible than the North for its continuance. If, then,\r\nfor a common object this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that\r\nit be done at a common charge?\r\n\r\nAnd if with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the\r\nbenefits of the Union by this means than we can by the war alone, is it\r\nnot also economical to do it? Let us consider it, then. Let us ascertain\r\nthe sum we have expended in the war Since compensated emancipation\r\nwas proposed last March, and consider whether if that measure had been\r\npromptly accepted by even some of the slave States the same sum would not\r\nhave done more to close the war than has been otherwise done. If so,\r\nthe measure would save money, and in that view would be a prudent and\r\neconomical measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is\r\nto pay nothing, but it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a\r\nlarger one. And it is easier to pay any sum when we are able than it is to\r\npay it before we are able. The war requires large sums, and requires\r\nthem at once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of\r\ncourse would be large. But it would require no ready cash, nor the bonds\r\neven any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not, and\r\nprobably would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years. At\r\nthat time we shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the\r\nburden, instead of thirty-one millions as now. And not only so, but the\r\nincrease of our population may be expected to continue for a long time\r\nafter that period as rapidly as before, because our territory will not\r\nhave become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio\r\nof increase which we have maintained, on an average, from our first\r\nnational census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should in 1900 have a\r\npopulation of 103,208,415. And why may we not continue that ratio far\r\nbeyond that period? Our abundant room, our broad national homestead,\r\nis our ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the British\r\nIsles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated. Instead\r\nof receiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled to send part\r\nof the native born away. But such is not our condition. We have 2,963,000\r\nsquare miles. Europe has 3,800,000, with a population averaging 73 persons\r\nto the square mile. Why may not our country at some time average as many?\r\nIs it less fertile? Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers,\r\nlakes, deserts, or other causes? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural\r\nadvantage? If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe, how\r\nsoon? As to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present;\r\nas to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the\r\nUnion...............\r\n\r\n          [a page of tables of projected statistics]\r\n\r\nThese figures show that our country may be as populous as Europe now is\r\nat some point between 1920 and 1930, say about 1925--our territory, at 73\r\npersons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain 217,186,000.\r\n\r\nAnd we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance\r\nby the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war springing\r\nfrom the only great element of national discord among us. While it cannot\r\nbe foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding\r\nlesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization, and\r\nprosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\nThe proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace,\r\ninsure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of\r\nthe country. With these we should pay all the emancipation would cost,\r\ntogether with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt\r\nwithout it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per\r\ncent. per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary\r\nstruggle until to-day, without paying anything on either principal or\r\ninterest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man\r\nowed upon it then; and this because our increase of men through the\r\nwhole period has been greater than six per cent.--has run faster than the\r\ninterest upon the debt. Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation, so long\r\nas its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nThis fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due,\r\nbut it shows the great importance of time in this connection--the great\r\nadvantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number\r\n100,000,000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now, when\r\nwe number but 31,000,000. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much\r\nharder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the\r\nproposed plan. And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life.\r\nIt will be a saving of both.\r\n\r\nAs to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return\r\nto bondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them,\r\ndoubtless, in the property sense belong to loyal owners, and hence\r\nProvision is made in this article for compensating such.\r\n\r\nThe third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not\r\noblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may\r\nconsent. This ought nut to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or\r\non the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual\r\nconsent of the people to be deported and the American voters through their\r\nrepresentatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nI cannot make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor\r\ncolonization; and yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against\r\nfree colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary,\r\nif not sometimes malicious.\r\n\r\nIt is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor\r\nand white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch\r\narguments that time surely is not now. In times like the present men\r\nshould utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible\r\nthrough time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can\r\ndisplace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves?\r\nIf they stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they\r\nleave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers. Logically,\r\nthere is neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without\r\ndeportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very\r\nsurely would not reduce them. Thus the customary amount of labor would\r\nstill have to be performed. The freed people would surely not do more than\r\ntheir old proportion of it, and very probably for a time would do less,\r\nleaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor\r\ninto greater demand, and consequently enhancing the wages of it. With\r\ndeportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white labor\r\nis mathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity in the\r\nmarket-increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it. Reduce\r\nthe supply of black labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the\r\ncountry, and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of\r\nwhite labor.\r\n\r\nBut it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the\r\nwhole land. Are they not already in the land? Will liberation make them\r\nany more numerous? Equally distributed among the whites of the whole\r\ncountry, and there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the\r\none in any way greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities now\r\nhaving more than one free colored person to seven whites, and this without\r\nany apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District of Columbia\r\nand the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this condition. The\r\nDistrict has more than one free colored to six whites, and yet in its\r\nfrequent petitions to Congress I believe it has never presented the\r\npresence of free colored persons as one of its grievances. But why should\r\nemancipation South send the free people North? People of any color seldom\r\nrun unless there be something to run from. Heretofore colored people to\r\nsome extent have fled North from bondage, and now, perhaps, from both\r\nbondage and destitution. But if gradual emancipation and deportation be\r\nadopted, they will have neither to flee from. Their old masters will give\r\nthem wages at least until new laborers can be procured, and the freedmen\r\nin turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be\r\nfound for them in congenial climes and with people of their own blood and\r\nrace. This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved.\r\nAnd in any event, cannot the North decide for itself whether to receive\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nAgain, as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there been\r\nany irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of\r\nslavery in this District last spring?\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites\r\nin the District is from the census of 1860, having no reference to\r\npersons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of Congress\r\nabolishing slavery here.\r\n\r\nThe plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a\r\nrestoration of the national authority would be accepted without its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nNor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of September 22,\r\n1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. Its timely\r\nadoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both.\r\n\r\nAnd notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide\r\nby law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation before this\r\nplan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be\r\nonly an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply to both.\r\n\r\nThis plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional\r\nto, all others for restoring and preserving the national authority\r\nthroughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in its\r\neconomical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more\r\nspeedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by force alone,\r\nwhile all it would cost, considering amounts and manner of payment and\r\ntimes of payment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of\r\nthe war if we rely solely upon force. It is much, very much, that it would\r\ncost no blood at all.\r\n\r\nThe plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It cannot become\r\nsuch without the concurrence of, first, two thirds of Congress, and\r\nafterwards three fourths of the States. The requisite three fourths of\r\nthe States will necessarily include seven of the slave States. Their\r\nconcurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting\r\nemancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional terms.\r\nThis assurance would end the struggle now and save the Union forever.\r\n\r\nI do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to\r\nthe Congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation, nor do\r\nI forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you have more\r\nexperience than I in the conduct of public affairs. Yet I trust that in\r\nview of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want\r\nof respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may seem to display.\r\n\r\nIs it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten\r\nthe war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is\r\nit doubted that it would restore the national authority and national\r\nprosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we\r\nhere--Congress and executive--can secure its adoption? Will not the good\r\npeople respond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they,\r\nby any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects?\r\nWe can succeed only by concert. It is not \"Can any of us imagine better?\"\r\nbut \"Can we all do better?\" Object whatsoever is possible, still the\r\nquestion recurs, \"Can we do better?\" The dogmas of the quiet past\r\nare inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with\r\ndifficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we\r\nmust think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we\r\nshall save our country.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, we can not escape history. We of this Congress and this\r\nadministration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal\r\nsignificance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery\r\ntrial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the\r\nlatest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget\r\nthat we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we\r\ndo know how to save it. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the\r\nresponsibility. In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the\r\nfree--honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly\r\nsave or meanly lose the last, best hope of earth. Other means may succeed;\r\nthis could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way\r\nwhich if followed the world will forever applaud and God must forever\r\nbless.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of November, 1861, a collision took place off the coast of Cuba\r\nbetween the United States war steamer San Jacinto and the French brig\r\nJules et Marie, resulting in serious damage to the latter. The obligation\r\nof this Government to make amends therefor could not be questioned if the\r\ninjury resulted from any fault On the part of the San Jacinto. With a view\r\nto ascertain this, the subject was referred to a commission of the United\r\nStates and French naval officers at New York, with a naval officer of\r\nItaly as an arbiter. The conclusion arrived at was that the collision was\r\noccasioned by the failure of the San Jacinto seasonably to reverse\r\nher engine. It then became necessary to ascertain the amount of\r\nindemnification due to the injured party. The United States consul-general\r\nat Havana was consequently instructed to confer with the consul of France\r\non this point, and they have determined that the sum of $9,500 is an\r\nequitable allowance under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nI recommend an appropriation of this sum for the benefit of the owners of\r\nthe Jules et Marie.\r\n\r\nA copy of the letter of Mr. Shufeldt, the consul-general of the United\r\nStates at Havana, to the Secretary of State on the subject is herewith\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

December 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend,\r\nthat Commander John L. Worden, United States Navy, receive a vote of\r\nthanks of Congress for the eminent skill and gallantry exhibited by him\r\nin the late remarkable battle between the United States ironclad steamer\r\nMonitor, under his command, and the rebel ironclad steamer Merrimac, in\r\nMarch last.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of Congress for his services on the occasion referred to were\r\ntendered by a resolution approved July 11, 1862, but the recommendation is\r\nnow specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth\r\nsection of the act of July 16, 1862, which is in the following words,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\n\"That any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one\r\ngrade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the\r\nthanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the\r\nenemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

DuBois.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--In the summer of 1859, when Mr. Freeman visited Springfield,\r\nIllinois, in relation to the McCallister and Stebbins bonds I promised him\r\nthat, upon certain conditions, I would ask members of the Legislature to\r\ngive him a full and fair hearing of his case. I do not now remember, nor\r\nhave I time to recall, exactly what the conditions were, nor whether they\r\nwere completely performed; but there can be in no case any harm [in] his\r\nhaving a full and fair hearing, and I sincerely wish it may be given him.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nDecember 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your resolution of December 5, 1862, requesting the\r\nPresident \"to furnish the Senate with all information in his possession\r\ntouching the late Indian barbarities in the State of Minnesota, and also\r\nthe evidence in his possession upon which some of the principal actors\r\nand head men were tried and condemned to death,\" I have the honor to\r\nstate that on receipt of said resolution, I transmitted the same to the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, accompanied by a note, a copy of which is\r\nherewith inclosed, marked A, and in response to which I received, through\r\nthat department, a letter of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, a copy of\r\nwhich is herewith inclosed, marked B.\r\n\r\nI further state that on the eighth day of November last I received a long\r\ntelegraphic despatch from Major-General Pope, at St. Paul, Minnesota,\r\nsimply announcing the names of the persons sentenced to be hanged. I\r\nimmediately telegraphed to have transcripts of the records in all cases\r\nforwarded to me, which transcripts, however, did not reach me until two\r\nor three days before the present meeting of Congress. Meantime I received,\r\nthrough telegraphic despatches and otherwise, appeals in behalf of the\r\ncondemned, appeals for their execution, and expressions of opinion as to\r\nthe proper policy in regard to them and to the Indians generally in that\r\nvicinity, none of which, as I understand, falls within the scope of your\r\ninquiry. After the arrival of the transcripts of records, but before I had\r\nsufficient opportunity to examine them, I received a joint letter from\r\none of the senators and two of the representatives from Minnesota, which\r\ncontains some statements of fact not found in the records of the trials,\r\nand for which reason I herewith transmit a copy, marked C. I also, for\r\nthe same reason, inclose a printed memorial of the citizens of St. Paul,\r\naddressed to me, and forwarded with the letter aforesaid.\r\n\r\nAnxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak\r\non the one hand, nor with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the\r\nother, I caused a careful examination of the records of trials to be made,\r\nin view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved guilty\r\nof violating females. Contrary to my expectation, only two of this class\r\nwere found. I then directed a further examination and a classification of\r\nall who were proven to have participated in massacres, as distinguished\r\nfrom participation in battles. This class numbered forty, and included\r\nthe two convicted of female violation. One of the number is strongly\r\nrecommended, by the commission which tried them, for commutation to ten\r\nyears imprisonment I have ordered the other thirty-nine to be executed on\r\nFriday the 19th instant. The order was despatched from here on Monday, the\r\n8th instant, by a messenger to General Sibley, and a copy of which order\r\nis herewith transmitted, marked D.\r\n\r\nAn abstract of the evidence as to the forty is herewith inclosed, marked\r\nE.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the immense amount of copying, I lay before the Senate the\r\noriginal transcripts of the records of trials, as received by me.\r\n\r\nThis is as full and complete a response to the resolution as it is in my\r\npower to make.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nDecember 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI have in my possession three valuable swords, formerly the property of\r\nGeneral David E. Twiggs, which I now place at the disposal of Congress.\r\nThey are forwarded to me from New Orleans by Major-General Benjamin F.\r\nButler. If they or any of them shall be by Congress disposed of in reward\r\nor compliment of military service, I think General Butler is entitled to\r\nthe first consideration. A copy of the General's letter to me accompanying\r\nthe swords is herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FERNANDO WOOD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON DECEMBER 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. FERNANDO WOOD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 8th, with the accompanying note of same\r\ndate, was received yesterday. The most important paragraph in the letter,\r\nas I consider, is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"On the 25th of November last I was advised by an authority which I deemed\r\nlikely to be well informed, as well as reliable and truthful, that the\r\nSouthern States would send representatives to the next Congress, provided\r\nthat a full and general amnesty should permit them to do so. No guarantee\r\nor terms were asked for other than the amnesty referred to.\"\r\n\r\nI strongly suspect your information will prove to be groundless;\r\nnevertheless, I thank you for communicating it to me. Understanding the\r\nphrase in the paragraph just quoted--\"the Southern States would send\r\nrepresentatives to the next Congress\"--to be substantially the same as\r\nthat \"the people of the Southern States would cease resistance, and would\r\nreinaugurate, submit to, and maintain the national authority within the\r\nlimits of such States, under the Constitution of the United States,\" I say\r\nthat in such case the war would cease on the part of the United States;\r\nand that if within a reasonable time \"a full and general amnesty\" were\r\nnecessary to such end, it would not be withheld.\r\n\r\nI do not think it would be proper now to communicate this, formally or\r\ninformally, to the people of the Southern States. My belief is that they\r\nalready know it; and when they choose, if ever, they can communicate\r\nwith me unequivocally. Nor do I think it proper now to suspend military\r\noperations to try any experiment of negotiation.\r\n\r\nI should nevertheless receive with great pleasure the exact information\r\nyou now have, and also such other as you may in any way obtain. Such\r\ninformation might be more valuable before the 1st of January than\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nWhile there is nothing in this letter which I shall dread to see in\r\nhistory, it is, perhaps, better for the present that its existence should\r\nnot become public. I therefore have to request that you will regard it as\r\nconfidential.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 14, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nIf my friend Dr. William Fithian, of Danville, Ill., should call on YOU,\r\nplease give him such facilities as you consistently can about recovering\r\nthe remains of a step-son, and matters connected therewith.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Watkins, of Jackson, Mo., (who is half brother to Henry Clay),\r\nwrites me that a colonel of ours has driven him from his home at Jackson.\r\nWill you please look into the case and restore the old man to his home if\r\nthe public interest will admit?\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

CHASE.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--You have respectively tendered me your resignations as\r\nSecretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. I\r\nam apprised of the circumstances which may render this course personally\r\ndesirable to each of you; but after most anxious consideration my\r\ndeliberate judgment is that the public interest does not admit of it.\r\nI therefore have to request that you will resume the duties of your\r\ndepartments respectively.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR ANDREW.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., December 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR ANDREW, Boston, Mass.:\r\n\r\nNeither the Secretary of War nor I know anything except what you tell us\r\nabout the \"published official document\" you mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. J. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. T. J. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:-Your letter of the 8th to Hon. William Kellogg has just been\r\nshown me. You can scarcely overestimate the pleasure it would give me to\r\noblige you, but nothing is operating so ruinously upon us everywhere as\r\n\"absenteeism.\" It positively will not do for me to grant leaves of absence\r\nin cases not sufficient to procure them under the regular rules.\r\n\r\nIt would astonish you to know the extent of the evil of \"absenteeism.\" We\r\nscarcely have more than half the men we are paying on the spot for service\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGRATULATIONS TO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nDecember 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC:\r\n\r\nI have just read your general's report of the battle of Fredericksburg.\r\nAlthough you were not successful, the attempt was not an error, nor the\r\nfailure other than accident. The courage with which you, in an open field,\r\nmaintained the contest against an intrenched foe, and the consummate skill\r\nand success with which you crossed and recrossed the river in the face of\r\nthe enemy, show that you possess all the qualities of a great army,\r\nwhich will yet give victory to the cause of the country and of popular\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nCondoling with the mourners for the dead, and sympathizing with\r\nthe severely wounded, I congratulate you that the number of both is\r\ncomparatively so small.\r\n\r\nI tender to you, officers and soldiers, the thanks of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF CONDOLENCE\r\n\r\nTO MISS FANNY McCULLOUGH.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December, 23, 1862.\r\n\r\nDEAR FANNY:--It is with deep regret that I learn of the death of your kind\r\nand brave father, and especially that it is affecting your young heart\r\nbeyond what is common in such cases. In this sad world of ours sorrow\r\ncomes to all, and to the young it comes with bittered agony because it\r\ntakes them unawares.\r\n\r\nThe older have learned ever to expect it. I am anxious to afford some\r\nalleviation of your present distress, perfect relief is not possible,\r\nexcept with time. You cannot now realize that you will ever feel better.\r\nIs not this so? And yet it is a mistake. You are sure to be happy again.\r\nTo know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable\r\nnow. I have had experience enough to know what I say, and you need only to\r\nbelieve it to feel better at once. The memory of your dear father, instead\r\nof an agony, will yet be a sad, sweet feeling in your heart, of a purer\r\nand holier sort than you have known before.\r\n\r\nPlease present my kind regards to your afflicted mother.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 26, 1862\r\n\r\nHONORABLE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSir:--Two Ohio regiments and one Illinois regiment which were captured at\r\nHartsville have been paroled and are now at Columbus, Ohio. This brings\r\nthe Ohio regiments substantially to their homes. I am strongly impressed\r\nwith the belief that the Illinois regiment better be sent to Illinois,\r\nwhere it will be recruited and put in good condition by the time they are\r\nexchanged so as to re-enter the service. They did not misbehave, as I\r\nam satisfied, so that they should receive no treatment nor have anything\r\nwithheld from them by way of punishment.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 27, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nLet the order in regard to Dr. McPheeters and family be suspended until\r\nyou hear from me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR GAMBLE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, December 27, 1862.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR GAMBLE:\r\n\r\nI do not wish to leave the country north of the Missouri to the care of\r\nthe enrolled militia except upon the concurrent judgment of yourself and\r\nGeneral Curtis. His I have not yet obtained. Confer with him, and I shall\r\nbe glad to act when you and he agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E.

If in\r\nsuch a difficulty as this you do not help, you fail me precisely in the\r\npoint for which I sought your assistance You know what General Burnside's\r\nplan is, and it is my wish that you go with him to the ground, examine it\r\nas far as practicable, confer with the officers, getting their judgment,\r\nand ascertaining their temper--in a word, gather all the elements for\r\nforming a judgment of your own, and then tell General Burnside that you\r\ndo approve or that you do not approve his plan.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. R. CURTIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON JANUARY 2, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of December 29 by the hand of Mr. Strong is just\r\nreceived. The day I telegraphed you suspending the order in relation to\r\nDr. McPheeters, he, with Mr. Bates, the Attorney-General, appeared before\r\nme and left with me a copy of the order mentioned. The doctor also showed\r\nme the Copy of an oath which he said he had taken, which is indeed very\r\nstrong and specific. He also verbally assured me that he had constantly\r\nprayed in church for the President and government, as he had always done\r\nbefore the present war. In looking over the recitals in your order, I do\r\nnot see that this matter of the prayer, as he states it, is negatived,\r\nnor that any violation of his oath is charged nor, in fact, that anything\r\nspecific is alleged against him. The charges are all general: that he has\r\na rebel wife and rebel relations, that he sympathies with rebels, and\r\nthat he exercises rebel influence. Now, after talking with him, I tell\r\nyou frankly I believe he does sympathize with the rebels, but the question\r\nremains whether such a man, of unquestioned good moral character, who has\r\ntaken such an oath as he has, and cannot even be charged with violating\r\nit, and who can be charged with no other specific act or omission, can,\r\nwith safety to the government, be exiled upon the suspicion of his secret\r\nsympathies. But I agree that this must be left to you, who are on the\r\nspot; and if, after all, you think the public good requires his removal,\r\nmy suspension of the order is withdrawn, only with this qualification,\r\nthat the time during the suspension is not to be counted against him. I\r\nhave promised him this. But I must add that the United States Government\r\nmust not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches. When an\r\nindividual in a church or out of it becomes dangerous to the public\r\ninterest, he must be checked; but let the churches, as such, take care\r\nof themselves. It will not do for the United States to appoint trustees,\r\nsupervisors, or other agents for the churches.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--The committee composed of Messrs. Yeatman and Filley (Mr. Broadhead\r\nnot attending) has presented your letter and the memorial of sundry\r\ncitizens. On the whole subject embraced exercise your best judgment,\r\nwith a sole view to the public interest, and I will not interfere without\r\nhearing you.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN., January 3, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY WELLES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. GIDEON WELLES, Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--As many persons who come well recommended for loyalty and\r\nservice to the Union cause, and who are refugees from rebel oppression in\r\nthe State of Virginia, make application to me for authority and permission\r\nto remove their families and property to protection within the Union\r\nlines, by means of our armed gunboats on the Potomac River and Chesapeake\r\nBay, you are hereby requested to hear and consider all such applications,\r\nand to grant such assistance to this class of persons as in your judgment\r\ntheir merits may render proper, and as may in each case be consistent with\r\nthe perfect and complete efficiency of the naval service and with military\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. L CURTIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am having a good deal of trouble with Missouri matters,\r\nand I now sit down to write you particularly about it. One class of\r\nfriends believe in greater severity and another in greater leniency in\r\nregard to arrests, banishments, and assessments. As usual in such cases,\r\neach questions the other's motives. On the one hand, it is insisted that\r\nGovernor Gamble's unionism, at most, is not better than a secondary spring\r\nof action; that hunkerism and a wish for political influence stand\r\nbefore Unionism with him. On the other hand, it is urged that arrests,\r\nbanishments, and assessments are made more for private malice, revenge,\r\nand pecuniary interest than for the public good. This morning I was told,\r\nby a gentleman who I have no doubt believes what he says, that in one\r\ncase of assessments for $10,000 the different persons who paid compared\r\nreceipts, and found they had paid $30,000. If this be true, the inference\r\nis that the collecting agents pocketed the odd $20,000. And true or not\r\nin the instance, nothing but the sternest necessity can justify the\r\nmaking and maintaining of a system so liable to such abuses. Doubtless the\r\nnecessity for the making of the system in Missouri did exist, and whether\r\nit continues for the maintenance of it is now a practical and very\r\nimportant question. Some days ago Governor Gamble telegraphed me, asking\r\nthat the assessments outside of St. Louis County might be suspended, as\r\nthey already have been within it, and this morning all the members of\r\nCongress here from Missouri but one laid a paper before me asking the same\r\nthing. Now, my belief is that Governor Gamble is an honest and true man,\r\nnot less so than yourself; that you and he could confer together on this\r\nand other Missouri questions with great advantage to the public; that each\r\nknows something which the other does not; and that acting together you\r\ncould about double your stock of pertinent information. May I not hope\r\nthat you and he will attempt this? I could at once safely do (or you could\r\nsafely do without me) whatever you and he agree upon. There is absolutely\r\nno reason why you should not agree.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--I forgot to say that Hon. James S. Rollins, member of Congress\r\nfrom one of the Missouri districts, wishes that, upon his personal\r\nresponsibility, Rev. John M. Robinson, of Columbia, Missouri; James L.\r\nMatthews, of Boone County, Missouri; and James L. Stephens, also of Boone\r\nCounty, Missouri, may be allowed to return to their respective homes.\r\nMajor Rollins leaves with me very strong papers from the neighbors of\r\nthese men, whom he says he knows to be true men. He also says he has many\r\nconstituents who he thinks are rightly exiled, but that he thinks these\r\nthree should be allowed to return. Please look into the case, and oblige\r\nMajor Rollins if you consistently can.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Copy sent to Governor Gamble.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CALEB RUSSELL AND SALLIE A. FENTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY GOOD FRIENDS: The Honorable Senator Harlan has just placed in my hands\r\nyour letter of the 27th of December, which I have read with pleasure and\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nIt is most cheering and encouraging for me to know that in the efforts\r\nwhich I have made and am making for the restoration of a righteous peace\r\nto our country, I am upheld and sustained by the good wishes and prayers\r\nof God's people. No one is more deeply than myself aware that without His\r\nfavor our highest wisdom is but as foolishness and that our most strenuous\r\nefforts would avail nothing in the shadow of His displeasure.\r\n\r\nI am conscious of no desire for my country's welfare that is not in\r\nconsonance with His will, and of no plan upon which we may not ask His\r\nblessing. It seems to me that if there be one subject upon which all good\r\nmen may unitedly agree, it is imploring the gracious favor of the God of\r\nNations upon the struggles our people are making for the preservation of\r\ntheir precious birthright of civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nVery truly your friend;\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5. 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.: Your despatch\r\nannouncing retreat of enemy has just reached here. God bless you and all\r\nwith you! Please tender to all, and accept for yourself, the nation's\r\ngratitude for your and their skill, endurance, and dauntless courage.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., January 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL DIX, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nDo Richmond papers of 6th say nothing about Vicksburg, or if anything,\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON January 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--What think you of forming a reserve cavalry corps of, say,\r\n6000 for the Army of the Potomac? Might not such a corps be constituted\r\nfrom the cavalry of Sigel's and Slocum's corps, with scraps we could pick\r\nup here and there?\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO B. G. BROWN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., January 7, 1863. 5.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. B. GRATZ BROWN, Jefferson City, Mo.:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day just received. The administration takes no part between\r\nits friends in Missouri, of whom I, at least, consider you one; and I have\r\nnever before had an intimation that appointees there were interfering, or\r\nwere inclined to interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE, JANUARY 8, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC January 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nSince my return to the army I have become more than ever convinced that\r\nthe general officers of this command are almost unanimously opposed to\r\nanother crossing of the river; but I am still of the opinion that the\r\ncrossing should be attempted, and I have accordingly issued orders to the\r\nengineers and artillery to prepare for it. There is much hazard in it, as\r\nthere always is in the majority of military movements, and I cannot begin\r\nthe movement without giving you notice of it, particularly as I know so\r\nlittle of the effect that it may have upon other movements of distant\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nThe influence of your telegram the other day is still upon me, and has\r\nimpressed me with the idea that there are many parts of the problem which\r\ninfluence you that are not known to me.\r\n\r\nIn order to relieve you from all embarrassment in my case, I inclose with\r\nthis my resignation of my commission as major-general of volunteers, which\r\nyou can have accepted if my movement is not in accordance with the views\r\nof yourself and your military advisers.\r\n\r\nI have taken the liberty to write to you personally upon this subject,\r\nbecause it was necessary, as I learned from General Halleck, for you to\r\napprove of my general plan, written at Warrenton, before I could commence\r\nthe movement; and I think it quite as necessary that you should know of\r\nthe important movement I am about to make, particularly as it will have to\r\nbe made in opposition to the views of nearly all my general officers, and\r\nafter the receipt of a despatch from you informing me of the opinion of\r\nsome of them who had visited you.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with you on New Year's morning I was led to express some\r\nopinions which I afterward felt it my duty to place on paper, and to\r\nexpress them verbally to the gentleman of whom we were speaking, which I\r\ndid in your presence, after handing you the letter. You were not disposed\r\nthen, as I saw, to retain the letter, and I took it back, but I now return\r\nit to you for record if you wish it.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to say that my resignation is not sent in in any spirit of\r\ninsubordination, but, as I before said, simply to relieve you from any\r\nembarrassment in changing commanders where lack of confidence may have\r\nrendered it necessary.\r\n\r\nThe bearer of this will bring me any answer, or I should be glad to hear\r\nfrom you by telegraph in cipher.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. E. BURNSIDE,\r\n\r\nMajor-General, Commanding Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, January 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Commanding, etc., Falmouth:\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--Your communication of the 5th was delivered to me by your\r\naide-de-camp at 12 M. to-day.\r\n\r\nIn all my communications and interviews with you since you took command\r\nof the Army of the Potomac I have advised a forward movement across the\r\nRappahannock. At our interview at Warrenton I urged that you should cross\r\nby the fords above Fredericksburg rather than to fall down to that\r\nplace; and when I left you at Warrenton it was understood that at least\r\na considerable part of your army would cross by the fords, and I so\r\nrepresented to the President. It was this modification of the plan\r\nproposed by you that I telegraphed you had received his approval. When\r\nthe attempt at Fredericksburg was abandoned, I advised you to renew the\r\nattempt at some other point, either in whole or in part, to turn the\r\nenemy's works, or to threaten their wings or communications; in other\r\nwords, to keep the enemy occupied till a favorable opportunity offered to\r\nstrike a decisive blow. I particularly advised you to use your cavalry\r\nand light artillery upon his communications, and attempt to cut off his\r\nsupplies and engage him at an advantage.\r\n\r\nIn all our interviews I have urged that our first object was, not\r\nRichmond, but the defeat or scattering of Lee's army, which threatened\r\nWashington and the line of the upper Potomac. I now recur to these things\r\nsimply to remind you of the general views which I have expressed, and\r\nwhich I still hold.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the case, however, have somewhat changed since the\r\nearly part of November. The chances of an extended line of operations\r\nare now, on account of the advanced season, much less than then. But\r\nthe chances are still in our favor to meet and defeat the enemy on the\r\nRappahannock, if we can effect a crossing in a position where we can meet\r\nthe enemy on favorable or even equal terms. I therefore still advise a\r\nmovement against him. The character of that movement, however, must depend\r\nupon circumstances which may change any day and almost any hour. If the\r\nenemy should concentrate his forces at the place you have selected for a\r\ncrossing, make it a feint and try another place. Again, the circumstances\r\nat the time may be such as to render an attempt to cross the entire\r\narmy not advisable. In that case, theory suggests that, while the enemy\r\nconcentrates at that point, advantages can be gained by crossing smaller\r\nforces at other points to cut off his lines, destroy his communication,\r\nand capture his rear-guards, outposts, etc. The great object is to occupy\r\nthe enemy to prevent his making large detachments or distant raids, and to\r\ninjure him all you can with the least injury to yourself. If this can\r\nbe best accomplished by feints of a general crossing and detached real\r\ncrossings, take that course; if by an actual general crossing, with feints\r\non other points, adopt that course. There seem to me to be many reasons\r\nwhy a crossing at some point should be attempted. It will not do to keep\r\nyour large army inactive. As you yourself admit, it devolves on you to\r\ndecide upon the time, place, and character of the crossing which you\r\nmay attempt. I can only advise that an attempt be made, and as early as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BURNSIDE:\r\n\r\nI understand General Halleck has sent you a letter of which this is a\r\ncopy. I approve this letter. I deplore the want of concurrence with you\r\nin opinion by your general officers, but I do not see the remedy. Be\r\ncautious, and do not understand that the government or country is driving\r\nyou. I do not yet see how I could profit by changing the command of the\r\nArmy of the Potomac; and if I did, I should not wish to do it by accepting\r\nthe resignation of your commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR JOHNSON, Nashville Tenn.:\r\n\r\nA dispatch of yesterday from Nashville says the body of Captain Todd, of\r\nthe Sixth Kentucky, was brought in to-day.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me what was his Christian name, and whether he was in our\r\nservice or that of the enemy. I shall also be glad to have your impression\r\nas to the effect the late operations about Murfreesborough will have on\r\nthe prospects of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. R. CURTIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, St. Louis, MO.:\r\n\r\nI understand there is considerable trouble with the slaves in Missouri.\r\nPlease do your best to keep peace on the question for two or three weeks,\r\nby which time we hope to do something here toward settling the question in\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 10, 1863\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR JOHNSON, Nashville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYours received. I presume the remains of Captain Todd are in the hands of\r\nhis family and friends, and I wish to give no order on the subject; but\r\nI do wish your opinion of the effects of the late battles about\r\nMurfreesborough upon the prospects of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTION TO THE JUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, January 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe Judge-Advocate-General is instructed to revise the proceedings of the\r\ncourt-martial in the case of Major-General Fitz-John Porter, and to report\r\nfully upon any legal questions that may have arisen in them, and upon the\r\nbearing of the testimony in reference to the charges and specifications\r\nexhibited against the accused, and upon which he was tried.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. JANUARY 14, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: The Secretary of State has submitted to\r\nme a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th instant, which\r\nhas been delivered to him, and which is in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Secretary of State be requested to communicate to this\r\nHouse, if not, in his judgment, incompatible with the public interest,\r\nwhy our Minister in New Granada has not presented his credentials to\r\nthe actual government of that country; also the reasons for which\r\nSenor Murillo is not recognized by the United States as the diplomatic\r\nrepresentative of the Mosquera government of that country; also,\r\nwhat negotiations have been had, if any, with General Herran as the\r\nrepresentative of Ospina's government in New Granada since it went into\r\nexistence.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th day of December, 1846, a treaty of amity, peace, and concord\r\nwas concluded between the United States of America and the Republic of\r\nNew Granada, which is still in force. On the 7th day of December, 1847,\r\nGeneral Pedro Alcantara Herran, who had been duly accredited, was received\r\nhere as the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that,\r\nrepublic. On the 30th day of August, 1849, Senor Don Rafael Rivas was\r\nreceived by this government as charge d'affaires of the same republic. On\r\nthe 5th day of December, 1851, a consular convention was concluded between\r\nthat republic and the United States, which treaty was signed on behalf of\r\nthe Republic of Granada by the same Senor Rivas. This treaty is still in\r\nforce. On the 27th of April, 1852, Senor Don Victoriano de Diego Paredes\r\nwas received as charge d'affaires of the Republic of New Granada. On the\r\n20th of June, 1855, General Pedro Alcantara Herran was again received as\r\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, duly accredited by the\r\nRepublic of New Granada, and he has ever since remained, under the same\r\ncredentials, as the representative of that republic near the Government of\r\nthe United States. On the 10th of September, 1857, a claims convention\r\nwas concluded between the United States and the Republic of Granada. This\r\nconvention is still in force, and has in part been executed. In May, 1858,\r\nthe constitution of the republic was remodelled; and the nation assumed\r\nthe political title of \"The Granadian Confederacy.\" This fact was\r\nformally announced to this Government, but without any change in\r\ntheir representative here. Previously to the 4th day of March, 1861, a\r\nrevolutionary war against the Republic of New Granada, which had thus\r\nbeen recognized and treated with by the United States, broke out in New\r\nGranada, assuming to set up a new government under the name of \"United\r\nStates of Colombia.\" This war has had various vicissitudes, sometimes\r\nfavorable, sometimes adverse, to the revolutionary movements. The\r\nrevolutionary organization has hitherto been simply a military\r\nprovisionary power, and no definitive constitution of government has\r\nyet been established in New Granada in place of that organized by the\r\nconstitution of 1858. The minister of the United States to the Granadian\r\nConfederacy, who was appointed on the 29th day of May, 1861, was directed,\r\nin view of the occupation of the capital by the revolutionary party and of\r\nthe uncertainty of the civil war, not to present his credentials to either\r\nthe government of the Granadian Confederacy or to the provisional military\r\ngovernment, but to conduct his affairs informally, as is customary in such\r\ncases, and to report the progress of events and await the instructions of\r\nthis Government. The advices which have been received from him have not\r\nhitherto, been sufficiently conclusive to determine me to recognize the\r\nrevolutionary government. General Herran being here, with full authority\r\nfrom the Government of New Canada, which has been so long recognized\r\nby the United States, I have not received any representative from the\r\nrevolutionary government, which has not yet been recognized, because such\r\na proceeding would be in itself an act of recognition.\r\n\r\nOfficial communications have been had on various incidental and occasional\r\nquestions with General Herran as the minister plenipotentiary and envoy\r\nextraordinary of the Granadian Confederacy, but in no other character. No\r\ndefinitive measure or proceeding has resulted from these communications,\r\nand a communication of them at present would not, in my judgment, be\r\ncompatible with the public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nPlease see Mr. Stafford, who wants to assist in raising colored troops in\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTING MONEY\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nJanuary 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI have signed the joint resolution to provide for the immediate payment\r\nof the army and navy of the United States, passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives on the 14th and by the Senate on the 15th instant.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution is a simple authority, amounting, however, under\r\nexisting circumstances, to a direction, to the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto make an additional issue of $100,000,000 in United States notes, if so\r\nmuch money is needed, for the payment of the army and navy.\r\n\r\nMy approval is given in order that every possible facility may be afforded\r\nfor the prompt discharge of all arrears of pay due to our soldiers and our\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\nWhile giving this approval, however, I think it my duty to express my\r\nsincere regret that it has been found necessary to authorize so large an\r\nadditional issue of United States notes, when this circulation and that\r\nof the suspended banks together have become already so redundant as to\r\nincrease prices beyond real values, thereby augmenting the cost of living\r\nto the injury of labor, and the cost of supplies to the injury of the\r\nwhole country.\r\n\r\nIt seems very plain that continued issues of United States notes without\r\nany check to the issues of suspended banks, and without adequate provision\r\nfor the raising of money by loans and for funding the issues so as to keep\r\nthem within due limits, must soon produce disastrous consequences; and\r\nthis matter appears to me so important that I feel bound to avail myself\r\nof this occasion to ask the special attention of Congress to it.\r\n\r\nThat Congress has power to regulate the currency of the country can hardly\r\nadmit of doubt, and that a judicious measure to prevent the deterioration\r\nof this currency, by a seasonable taxation of bank circulation or\r\notherwise, is needed seems equally clear. Independently of this general\r\nconsideration, it would be unjust to the people at large to exempt banks\r\nenjoying the special privilege of circulation from their just proportion\r\nof the public burdens.\r\n\r\nIn order to raise money by way of loans most easily and cheaply, it is\r\nclearly necessary to give every possible support to the public credit. To\r\nthat end a uniform currency, in which taxes, subscriptions to loans, and\r\nall other ordinary public dues as well as all private dues may be paid,\r\nis almost if not quite indispensable. Such a currency can be furnished\r\nby banking associations organized under a general act of Congress, as\r\nsuggested in my message at the beginning of the present session. The\r\nsecuring of this circulation by the pledge of United States bonds, as\r\ntherein suggested, would still further facilitate loans, by increasing the\r\npresent and causing a future demand for such bonds.\r\n\r\nIn view of the actual financial embarrassments of the government, and of\r\nthe greater embarrassment sure to come if the necessary means of relief\r\nbe not afforded, I feel that I should not perform my duty by a simple\r\nannouncement of my approval of the joint resolution, which proposes relief\r\nonly by increased circulation, without expressing my earnest desire that\r\nmeasures such in substance as those I have just referred to may receive\r\nthe early sanction of Congress. By such measures, in my opinion, will\r\npayment be most certainly secured, not only to the army and navy, but to\r\nall honest creditors of the government, and satisfactory provision made\r\nfor future demands on the treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF MANCHESTER, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF MANCHESTER:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the address and resolutions\r\nwhich you sent me on the eve of the new year. When I came, on the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1861, through a free and constitutional election to fireside in\r\nthe Government of the United States, the country was found at the verge of\r\ncivil war. Whatever might have been the cause, or whosesoever the fault,\r\none duty, paramount to all others, was before me, namely, to maintain\r\nand preserve at once the Constitution and the integrity of the Federal\r\nRepublic. A conscientious purpose to perform this duty is the key to\r\nall the measures of administration which have been and to all which will\r\nhereafter be pursued. Under our frame of government and my official oath,\r\nI could not depart from this purpose if I would. It is not always in the\r\npower of governments to enlarge or restrict the scope of moral results\r\nwhich follow the policies that they may deem it necessary for the public\r\nsafety from time to time to adopt.\r\n\r\nI have understood well that the duty of self-preservation rests solely\r\nwith the American people; but I have at the same time been aware that\r\nfavor or disfavor of foreign nations might have a material influence\r\nin enlarging or prolonging the struggle with disloyal men in which the\r\ncountry is engaged. A fair examination of history has served to authorize\r\na belief that the past actions and influences of the United States were\r\ngenerally regarded as having been beneficial toward mankind. I have,\r\ntherefore, reckoned upon the forbearance of nations. Circumstances--to\r\nsome of which you kindly allude--induce me especially to expect that if\r\njustice and good faith should be practised by the United States, they\r\nwould encounter no hostile influence on the part of Great Britain. It is\r\nnow a pleasant duty to acknowledge the demonstration you have given of\r\nyour desire that a spirit of amity and peace toward this country may\r\nprevail in the councils of your Queen, who is respected and esteemed in\r\nyour own country only more than she is by the kindred nation which has its\r\nhome on this side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nI know and deeply deplore the sufferings which the workingmen at\r\nManchester, and in all Europe, are called to endure in this crisis. It has\r\nbeen often and studiously represented that the attempt to overthrow this\r\ngovernment, which was built upon the foundation of human rights, and to\r\nsubstitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the basis of human\r\nslavery, was likely to obtain the favor of Europe. Through the action of\r\nour disloyal citizens, the working-men of Europe have been subjected to\r\nsevere trials, for the purpose of forcing their sanction to that attempt.\r\nUnder the circumstance, I cannot but regard your decisive utterances upon\r\nthe question as an instance of sublime Christian heroism which has not\r\nbeen surpassed in any age or in any country. It is indeed an energetic and\r\ninspiring assurance of the inherent power of truth and of the ultimate and\r\nuniversal triumph of justice, humanity, and freedom. I do not doubt that\r\nthe sentiments, you have expressed will be sustained by your great nation;\r\nand, on the other hand, I have no hesitation in assuring you that they\r\nwill excite admiration, esteem, and the most reciprocal feelings of\r\nfriendship among the American people.\r\n\r\nI hail this interchange of sentiment, therefore, as an augury that\r\nwhatever else may happen, whatever misfortune may befall your country or\r\nmy own, the peace and friendship which now exist between the two nations\r\nwill be, as it shall be my desire to make them, perpetual.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith for your consideration the joint resolutions of the\r\ncorporate authorities of the city of Washington, adopted September a 7,\r\n1862, and a memorial of the same under date of October 28, 1862, both\r\nrelating to and urging the construction of certain railroads concentrating\r\nupon the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nIn presenting this memorial and the joint resolutions to you, I am not\r\nprepared to say more than that the subject is one of great practical\r\nimportance, and that I hope it will receive the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFITZ-JOHN PORTER COURT-MARTIAL.\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT ON THE PROCEEDINGS AND SENTENCE\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJanuary 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the Sixty-fifth Article of War, these whole proceedings\r\nare transmitted to the Secretary of War, to be laid before the President\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK,\r\n\r\nGeneral-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nJanuary 21, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing proceedings, findings, and sentence in the foregoing case\r\nof Major-General Fitz-John Porter are approved and confirmed, and it is\r\nordered that the said Fitz-John Porter be, and he hereby is, cashiered\r\nand dismissed from the service of the United States as a major-general\r\nof volunteers, and as colonel and brevet brigadier-general in the regular\r\nservice of the United States, and forever disqualified from holding any\r\noffice of trust or profit under the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL HALLECK TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nJanuary 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GRANT, Memphis.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--The President has directed that so much of Arkansas as you may\r\ndesire to control be temporarily attached to your department. This will\r\ngive you control of both banks of the river.\r\n\r\nIn your operations down the Mississippi you must not rely too confidently\r\nupon any direct co-operation of General Banks and the lower flotilla, as\r\nit is possible that they may not be able to pass or reduce Port Hudson.\r\nThey, however, will do everything in their power to form a junction with\r\nyou at Vicksburg. If they should not be able to effect this, they will\r\nat least occupy a portion of the enemy's forces, and prevent them from\r\nreinforcing Vicksburg. I hope, however, that they will do still better and\r\nbe able to join you.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to give you some explanation of the revocation of your\r\norder expelling all Jews from your department. The President has no\r\nobjection to your expelling traitors and Jew peddlers, which, I suppose,\r\nwas the object of your order; but as it in terms proscribed an entire\r\nreligious class, some of whom are fighting in our ranks, the President\r\ndeemed it necessary to revoke it.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 23, 1863\r\n\r\nGENERAL BURNSIDE:\r\n\r\nWill see you any moment when you come.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Sumner, at his own request, be relieved from\r\nduty in the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n3d. That Major-General W. B. Franklin be relieved from duty in the Army of\r\nthe Potomac.\r\n\r\n4th. That Major-General J. Hooker be assigned to the command of the Army\r\nof the Potomac.\r\n\r\nII. The officers relieved as above will report in person to the\r\nadjutant-general of the army.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War: D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., January 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of\r\ncourse I have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient reasons,\r\nand yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in\r\nregard to which I am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to be a\r\nbrave and skillful soldier, which of course I like. I also believe you do\r\nnot mix politics with your profession, in which you are right. You have\r\nconfidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable\r\nquality. You are ambitious, which within reasonable bounds does good\r\nrather than harm; but I think that during General Burnside's command of\r\nthe army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much\r\nas you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most\r\nmeritorious and honorable brother officer. I have heard, in such a way\r\nas to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the\r\ngovernment needed a dictator. Of course it was not for this, but in spite\r\nof it, that I have given you the command. Only those generals who gain\r\nsuccesses can set up dictators. What I now ask of you is military success,\r\nand I will risk the dictatorship. The government will support you to the\r\nutmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done\r\nand will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit that you\r\nhave aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and\r\nwithholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist\r\nyou as far as I can to put it down. Neither you nor Napoleon, if he\r\nwere alive again, could get any good out of an army while such a spirit\r\nprevails in it. And now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with\r\nenergy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, January 28,1863,\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Commander David D. Porter, United States Navy, acting rear-admiral,\r\ncommanding the Mississippi Squadron, receive a vote of thanks of Congress\r\nfor the bravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas,\r\nwhich surrendered to the combined military and naval forces on the 10th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Lowell, Mass.:\r\n\r\nPlease come here immediately.

THURLOW WEED.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your valedictory to the patrons of the Albany Evening journal\r\nbrings me a good deal of uneasiness. What does it mean?\r\n\r\nTruly Yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY,\r\n\r\nJanuary 30, 1863. 5.45 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nWhat iron-clads, if any, have gone out of Hampton Roads within the last\r\ntwo days?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., January 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe, Va.: Corcoran's and Pryor's battle\r\nterminated. Have you any news through Richmond papers or otherwise?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHENCK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., January 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nI do not take jurisdiction of the pass question. Exercise your own\r\ndiscretion as to whether Judge Pettis shall have a pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF LONDON, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 1, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF LONDON:\r\n\r\nI have received the New Year's address which you have sent me, with a\r\nsincere appreciation of the exalted and humane sentiments by which it was\r\ninspired.\r\n\r\nAs these sentiments are manifestly the enduring support of the free\r\ninstitutions of England, so I am sure also that they constitute the only\r\nreliable basis for free institutions throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe resources, advantages, and powers of the American people are\r\nvery great, and they have consequently succeeded to equally great\r\nresponsibilities. It seems to have devolved upon them to test whether\r\na government established on the principles of human freedom can be\r\nmaintained against an effort to build one upon the exclusive foundation of\r\nhuman bondage. They will rejoice with me in the new evidences which your\r\nproceedings furnish that the magnanimity they are exhibiting is justly\r\nestimated by the true friends of freedom and humanity in foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nAccept my best wishes for your individual welfare, and for the welfare and\r\nhappiness of the whole British people.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHENCK. [Cipher.] WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nI hear of some difficulty in the streets of Baltimore yesterday. What is\r\nthe amount of it?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., February 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of September, 1862, Commander George Henry Preble, United\r\nStates Navy, then senior officer in command of the naval force off the\r\nharbor of Mobile, was guilty of inexcusable neglect in permitting the\r\narmed steamer Oreto in open daylight to run the blockade. For his omission\r\nto perform his whole duty on that occasion, and the injury thereby\r\ninflicted on the service and the country, his name was stricken from the\r\nlist of naval officers and he was dismissed [from] the service.\r\n\r\nSince his dismissal earnest application has been made for his restoration\r\nto his former position by senators and naval officers, on the ground that\r\nhis fault was an error of judgment, and that the example in his case has\r\nalready had its effect in preventing a repetition of similar neglect.\r\n\r\nI therefore on this application and representation, and in consideration\r\nof his previous fair record, do hereby nominate George Henry Preble to\r\nbe a commander in the navy from the 16th July, 1862, to take rank on the\r\nactive list next after Commander Edward Donaldson, and to fill a vacancy\r\noccasioned by the death of Commander J. M. Wainwright.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., February 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nOn the 24th August, 1861, Commander Roger Perry, United. States Navy,\r\nwas dismissed from the service under a misapprehension in regard to his\r\nloyalty to the Government, from the circumstance that several oaths\r\nwere transmitted to him and the Navy Department failed to receive any\r\nrecognition of them. After his dismissal, and upon his assurance that\r\nthe oath failed to reach him and his readiness to execute it, he was\r\nrecommissioned to his original position on the 4th September following.\r\nOn the same day, 4th September, he was ordered to command the sloop of war\r\nVandalia; on the 22d this order was revoked and he was ordered to duty in\r\nthe Mississippi Squadron, and on the 23d January, 1862, was detached sick,\r\nand has since remained unemployed. The advisory board under the act of\r\n16th July, 1862, did not recommend him for further promotion.\r\n\r\nThis last commission, having been issued during the recess of the Senate,\r\nexpired at the end of the succeeding session, 17th July, 1862, from which\r\ndate, not having been nominated to the Senate, he ceased to be a commander\r\nin the navy.\r\n\r\nTo correct the omission to nominate this officer to the Senate at its last\r\nsession, I now nominate Commander Roger Perry to be a commander in the\r\nnavy from the 14th September, 1855, to take his relative position on the\r\nlist of commanders not recommended for further promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 12,1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch about \"river patrolling\" received. I have called the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, Secretary of War, and General-in-Chief together,\r\nand submitted it to them, who promise to do their very best in the case. I\r\ncannot take it into my own hands without producing inextricable confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SIMON CAMERON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SIMON CAMERON, Harrisburg, Pa.: General Clay is here and I suppose\r\nthe matter we spoke of will have to be definitely settled now. Please\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALEXANDER REED.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nREV. ALEXANDER REED. MY DEAR SIR:--Your note, by which you, as General\r\nSuperintendent of the United States Christian Commission, invite me to\r\npreside at a meeting to be held this day at the hall of the House of\r\nRepresentatives in this city, is received.\r\n\r\nWhile, for reasons which I deem sufficient, I must decline to preside, I\r\ncannot withhold my approval of the meeting and its worthy objects.\r\n\r\nWhatever shall be, sincerely and in God's name, devised for the good of\r\nthe soldiers and seamen in their hard spheres of duty, can scarcely fail\r\nto be blessed; and whatever shall tend to turn our thoughts from the\r\nunreasoning and uncharitable passions, prejudices, and jealousies incident\r\nto a great national trouble such as ours, and to fix them on the vast and\r\nlong enduring consequences, for weal or for woe, which are to result from\r\nthe struggle, and especially to strengthen our reliance on the Supreme\r\nBeing for the final triumph of the right, cannot but be well for us all.\r\n\r\nThe birthday of Washington and the Christian Sabbath coinciding this year,\r\nand suggesting together the highest interests of this life and of that to\r\ncome, is most propitious for the meeting proposed.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

It\r\npains me some that this tilt for the place of Colonel Baker's friend\r\ngrows so fierce, now that the Colonel is no longer alive to defend him.\r\nI presume, however, we shall have no rest from it. In self-defense I am\r\ndisposed to say, \"Make a selection and send it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR TOD,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 9, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR DAVID TOD, Columbus, Ohio:\r\n\r\nI think your advice with that of others would be valuable in the selection\r\nof provost-marshals for Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION RECALLING SOLDIERS TO THEIR REGIMENTS, MARCH 10, 1863\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the twenty-sixth section of the act of Congress entitled\r\n\"An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other\r\npurposes,\" approved on the 3d day of March, 1863, I, Abraham Lincoln,\r\nPresident and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United\r\nStates, do hereby order and command that all soldiers enlisted or drafted\r\nin the service of the United States now absent from their regiments\r\nwithout leave shall forthwith return to their respective regiments.\r\n\r\nAnd I do hereby declare and proclaim that all soldiers now absent from\r\ntheir respective regiments without leave who shall, on or before the first\r\nday of April, 1863, report themselves at any rendezvous designated by\r\nthe general orders of the War Department No. 58, hereto annexed, may be\r\nrestored to their respective regiments without punishment, except the\r\nforfeiture of pay and allowances during their absence; and all who do not\r\nreturn within the time above specified shall be arrested as deserters and\r\npunished as the law provides; and\r\n\r\nWhereas evil-disposed and disloyal persons at sundry places have\r\nenticed and procured soldiers to desert and absent themselves from their\r\nregiments, thereby weakening the strength of the armies and prolonging the\r\nwar, giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and cruelly exposing the gallant\r\nand faithful soldiers remaining in the ranks to increased hardships and\r\ndanger:\r\n\r\nI do therefore call upon all patriotic and faithful citizens to oppose and\r\nresist the aforementioned dangerous and treasonable crimes, and to aid\r\nin restoring to their regiments all soldiers absent without leave, and to\r\nassist in the execution of the act of Congress \"for enrolling and calling\r\nout the national forces, and for other purposes,\" and to support the\r\nproper authorities in the prosecution and punishment of offenders against\r\nsaid act and in suppressing the insurrection and rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand.

I would like to oblige both if it would not\r\ninjure the service in your army, or incommode you. What say you?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Match 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nI am very glad of your note saying \"recent despatches from him are able,\r\njudicious, and loyal,\" and that if I agree; we will leave him there.

KNOX.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nWHOM IT MAY CONCERN:--Whereas, it appears to my satisfaction that Thomas\r\nW. Knox, a correspondent of the New York Herald, has been by the sentence\r\nof a court-martial excluded from the military department under command\r\nof Major-General Grant, and also that General Thayer, president of the\r\ncourt-martial which rendered the sentence, and Major-General McClernand,\r\nin command of a corps of that department, and many other respectable\r\npersons, are of opinion that Mr. Knox's offense was technical rather than\r\nwilfully wrong, and that the sentence should be revoked: now, therefore,\r\nsaid sentence is hereby so far revoked as to allow Mr. Knox to return to\r\nGeneral Grant's headquarters, and to remain if General Grant shall give\r\nhis express assent, and to again leave the department if General Grant\r\nshall refuse such assent.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN GRATZ.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 25,1863.\r\n\r\nMr. BENJAMIN GRATZ, Lexington, Ky.:\r\n\r\nShow this to whom it may concern as your authority for allowing Mrs. Selby\r\nto remain at your house, so long as you choose to be responsible for what\r\nshe may do.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYour dispatches about General Davis and General Mitchell are received.\r\nGeneral Davis' case is not particular, being simply one of a great many\r\nrecommended and not nominated because they would transcend the number\r\nallowed by law. General Mitchell (was) nominated and rejected by the\r\nSenate and I do not think it proper for me to renominate him without a\r\nchange of circumstances such as the performance of additional service, or\r\nan expressed change of purpose on the part of at least some senators who\r\nopposed him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

What from Yazoo Pass? What from\r\nLake Providence? What generally?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION OF RAISING NEGRO TROOPS\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON March 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am told you have at least thought of raising a negro\r\nmilitary force. In my opinion the country now needs no specific thing so\r\nmuch as some man of your ability and position to go to this work. When I\r\nspeak of your position, I mean that of an eminent citizen of a slave State\r\nand himself a slaveholder. The colored population is the great available\r\nand yet unavailed of force for restoring the Union. The bare sight of\r\nfifty thousand armed and drilled black soldiers upon the banks of the\r\nMississippi would end the rebellion at once; and who doubts that we\r\ncan present that sight if we but take hold in earnest? If you have been\r\nthinking of it, please do not dismiss the thought.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION APPOINTING A NATIONAL FAST-DAY.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nMarch 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Senate of the United States, devoutly recognizing the supreme\r\nauthority and just government of Almighty God in all the affairs of men\r\nand of nations, has by a resolution requested the President to designate\r\nand set apart a day for national prayer and humiliation:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas it is the duty of nations as well as men to own their\r\ndependence upon the overruling power of God; to confess their sins and\r\ntransgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine\r\nrepentance will lead to mercy and pardon; and to recognize the sublime\r\ntruth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that\r\nthose nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord:\r\n\r\nAnd insomuch as we know that by His divine law nations, like individuals,\r\nare subjected to punishments and chastisements in this world, may we not\r\njustly fear that the awful calamity of civil war which now desolates the\r\nland may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins,\r\nto the needful end of our national reformation as a whole people? We\r\nhave been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven. We have been\r\npreserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity. We have grown in\r\nnumbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown; but we have\r\nforgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in\r\npeace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly\r\nimagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings\r\nwere produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated\r\nwith unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the\r\nnecessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God\r\nthat made us:\r\n\r\nIt behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to\r\nconfess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, in compliance with the request, and fully concurring in\r\nthe views, of the Senate, I do by this my proclamation designate and\r\nset apart Thursday, the 30th day of April, 1863, as a day of national\r\nhumiliation, fasting, and prayer. And I do hereby request all the people\r\nto abstain on that day from their ordinary secular pursuits, and to unite\r\nat their several places of public worship and their respective homes in\r\nkeeping the day holy to the Lord, and devoted to the humble discharge of\r\nthe religious duties proper to that solemn occasion. All this being done\r\nin sincerity and truth, let us then rest humbly in the hope, authorized by\r\nthe divine teachings, that the united cry of the nation will be heard on\r\nhigh, and answered with blessings no less than the pardon of our national\r\nsins, and the restoration of our now divided and suffering country to its\r\nformer happy condition of unity and peace.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this thirtieth day of March, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n  Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE OF COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nWhereas by the act of Congress approved July 13, 1861, entitled \"An act to\r\nprovide for the collection of duties on imports, and for other purposes,\"\r\nall commercial intercourse between the inhabitants of such States as\r\nshould by proclamation be declared in insurrection against the United\r\nStates and the citizens of the rest of the United States was prohibited\r\nso long as such condition of hostility should continue, except as the\r\nsame shall be licensed and permitted by the President to be conducted and\r\ncarried on only in pursuance of rules and regulations prescribed by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury; and:\r\n\r\nWhereas it appears that a partial restoration of such intercourse between\r\nthe inhabitants of sundry places and sections heretofore declared in\r\ninsurrection in pursuance of said act and the citizens of the rest of the\r\nUnited States will favorably affect the public interests:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,\r\nexercising the authority and discretion confided to me by the said act of\r\nCongress, do hereby license and permit such commercial intercourse between\r\nthe citizens of loyal States and the inhabitants of such insurrectionary\r\nStates in the cases and under the restrictions described and expressed in\r\nthe regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury bearing\r\neven date with these presents, or in such other regulations as he may\r\nhereafter, with my approval, prescribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL D. HUNTER.\r\n\r\n(Private.) EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C April 1, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am glad to see the accounts of your colored force at\r\nJacksonville, Florida. I see the enemy are driving at them fiercely, as is\r\nto be expected. It is important to the enemy that such a force shall not\r\ntake shape and grow and thrive in the South, and in precisely the same\r\nproportion it is important to us that it shall. Hence the utmost caution\r\nand vigilance is necessary on our part. The enemy will make extra efforts\r\nto destroy them, and we should do the same to preserve and increase them.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION ABOUT COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE, APRIL 2, 1863\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, in pursuance of the act of Congress approved July 13, 1861, I\r\ndid, by proclamation dated August 16, 1861, declare that the inhabitants\r\nof the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nTennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida\r\n(except the inhabitants of that part of Virginia lying west of the\r\nAlleghany Mountains, and of such other parts of that State and the other\r\nStates hereinbefore named as might maintain a legal adhesion to the Union\r\nand the Constitution or might be from time to time occupied and controlled\r\nby forces of the United States engaged in the dispersion of said\r\ninsurgents) were in a state of insurrection against the United States,\r\nand that all commercial intercourse between the same and the inhabitants\r\nthereof, with the exceptions aforesaid, and the citizens of other States\r\nand other parts of the United States was unlawful and would remain\r\nunlawful until such insurrection should cease or be suppressed, and that\r\nall goods and chattels, wares and merchandise, coming from any of said\r\nStates, with the exceptions aforesaid, into other parts of the United\r\nStates without the license and permission of the President, through the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, or proceeding to any of said States, with\r\nthe exceptions aforesaid, by land or water, together with the vessel or\r\nvehicle conveying the same to or from said States, with the exceptions\r\naforesaid, would be forfeited to the United States, and:\r\n\r\nWhereas experience has shown that the exceptions made in and by said\r\nproclamation embarrass the due enforcement of said act of July 13, 1861,\r\nand the proper regulation of the commercial intercourse authorized by said\r\nact with the loyal citizens of said States:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby revoke the said exceptions, and declare that the inhabitants of\r\nthe States of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama,\r\nLouisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida, and Virginia (except the\r\nforty-eight counties of Virginia designated as West Virginia, and except\r\nalso the ports of New Orleans, Key West; Port Royal, and Beaufort in North\r\nCarolina) are in a state of insurrection against the United States, and\r\nthat all commercial intercourse not licensed and conducted as provided\r\nin said act between the said States and the inhabitants thereof, with the\r\nexceptions aforesaid, and the citizens of other States and other parts\r\nof the United States is unlawful and will remain unlawful until such\r\ninsurrection shall cease or has been suppressed and notice thereof has\r\nbeen duly given by proclamation; and all cotton, tobacco, and other\r\nproducts, and all other goods and chattels, wares and merchandise, coming\r\nfrom any of said States, with the exceptions aforesaid, into other parts\r\nof the United States, or proceeding to any of said States, with the\r\nexceptions aforesaid, without the license and permission of the President,\r\nthrough the Secretary of the Treasury, will together with the vessel or\r\nvehicle conveying the same, be forfeited to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this second day of April, A.D. 1863, and\r\nof the independence of the United States of America the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:   WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n   Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nOur plan is to pass Saturday night on the boat, go over from Aquia Creek\r\nto your camp Sunday morning, remain with you till Tuesday morning, and\r\nthen return. Our party will probably not exceed six persons of all sorts.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINION ON HARBOR DEFENSE.\r\n\r\nApril 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nOn this general subject I respectfully refer Mr.------__ to the\r\nSecretaries of War and Navy for conference and consultation. I have a\r\nsingle idea of my own about harbor defense. It is a steam ram, built so\r\nas to sacrifice nearly all capacity for carrying to those of speed and\r\nstrength, so as to be able to split any vessel having hollow enough in her\r\nto carry supplies for a voyage of any distance. Such ram, of course, could\r\nnot herself carry supplies for a voyage of considerable distance, and her\r\nbusiness would be to guard a particular harbor as a bulldog guards his\r\nmaster's door.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY POTOMAC, April 9, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY:\r\n\r\nRichmond Whig of the 8th has no telegraphic despatches from Charleston,\r\nbut has the following as editorial:\r\n\r\n\"All thoughts are now centred upon Charleston. Official intelligence was\r\nmade public early yesterday morning that the enemy's iron-clad fleet\r\nhad attempted to cross the bar and failed, but later in the day it was\r\nannounced that the gunboats and transports had succeeded in crossing and\r\nwere at anchor. Our iron-clads lay between the forts quietly awaiting the\r\nattack. Further intelligence is looked for with eager anxiety. The Yankees\r\nhave made no secret of this vast preparation for an attack on Charleston,\r\nand we may well anticipate a desperate conflict. At last the hour of trial\r\nhas come for Charleston, the hour of deliverance or destruction, for no\r\none believes the other alternative, surrender, possible. The heart of the\r\nwhole country yearns toward the beleaguered city with intense solicitude,\r\nyet with hopes amounting to confidence. Charleston knows what is expected\r\nof her, and which is due to her fame, and to the relation she sustains to\r\nthe cause. The devoted, the heroic, the great-hearted Beauregard is there,\r\nand he, too, knows what is expected of him and will not disappoint that\r\nexpectation. We predict a Saragossa defense, and that if Charleston is\r\ntaken it will be only a heap of ruins.\"\r\n\r\nThe rebel pickets are reported as calling over to our pickets today that\r\nwe had taken some rebel fort. This is not very intelligible, and I think\r\nis entirely unreliable.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO OFFICER IN COMMAND AT NASHVILLE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 11,1863.\r\n\r\nOFFICER IN COMMAND at Nashville, Tenn: Is there a soldier by the name\r\nof John R. Minnick of Wynkoop's cavalry under sentence of death, by a\r\ncourt-martial or military commission, in Nashville? And if so what was his\r\noffense, and when is he to be executed?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nIf necessary let the execution be staid till I can be heard from again.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n     [President Lincoln sent many telegrams similar in form to\r\n     this one in order to avoid tiresome repetition the editor\r\n     has omitted all those without especial interest.  Hardly a\r\n     day went by that there were not people in the White House\r\n     begging mercy for a sentenced soldier.  A mother one day,\r\n     pleaded with Lincoln to remit the sentence of execution on\r\n     her son. \"Well, I don't think it will do him a bit of good\"\r\n     said Mr. Lincoln--\"Pardoned.\" D.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON D.C., April 12, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nYour letter by the hand of General Butterfield is received, and will be\r\nconformed to. The thing you dispense with would have been ready by mid-day\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO ADMIRAL S. P. DUPONT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 13, 1863\r\n\r\nADMIRAL DUPONT:\r\n\r\nHold your position inside the bar near Charleston; or, if you shall have\r\nleft it, return to it, and hold it until further orders. Do not allow the\r\nenemy to erect new batteries or defenses on Morris Island. If he has begun\r\nit, drive him out. I do not herein order you to renew the general attack.\r\nThat is to depend on your own discretion or a further order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL D. HUNTER AND ADMIRAL S. F. DUPONT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 54, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HUNTER AND ADMIRAL DUPONT:\r\n\r\nThis is intended to clear up an apparent inconsistency between the recent\r\norder to continue operations before Charleston and the former one to\r\nremove to another point in a certain contingency. No censure upon you, or\r\neither of you, is intended. We still hope that by cordial and judicious\r\nco-operation you can take the batteries on Morris Island and Sullivan's\r\nIsland and Fort Sumter. But whether you can or not, we wish the\r\ndemonstration kept up for a time, for a collateral and very important\r\nobject. We wish the attempt to be a real one, though not a desperate one,\r\nif it affords any considerable chance of success. But if prosecuted as a\r\ndemonstration only, this must not become public, or the whole effect will\r\nbe lost. Once again before Charleston, do not leave until further orders\r\nfrom here. Of course this is not intended to force you to leave unduly\r\nexposed Hilton Head or other near points in your charge.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--Whoever receives this first, please send a copy to the other\r\nimmediately. A.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., April 15, 1863. 10.15 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nIt is now 10.15 P.M. An hour ago I received your letter of this morning,\r\nand a few moments later your despatch of this evening. The latter gives me\r\nconsiderable uneasiness. The rain and mud of course were to be calculated\r\nupon. General S. is not moving rapidly enough to make the expedition come\r\nto anything. He has now been out three days, two of which were unusually\r\nfair weather, and all three without hindrance from the enemy, and yet\r\nhe is not twenty-five miles from where he started. To reach his point he\r\nstill has sixty to go, another river (the Rapidan) to cross, and will be\r\nhindered by the enemy. By arithmetic, how many days will it take him to\r\ndo it? I do not know that any better can be done, but I greatly fear it is\r\nanother failure already. Write me often. I am very anxious.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON COLONIZATION ARRANGEMENTS\r\n\r\nREPUDIATION OF AN AGREEMENT WITH BERNARD KOCK\r\n\r\nAPRIL 16, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\r\nTO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME,\r\n\r\nGREETING:\r\n\r\nKnow ye that, whereas a paper bearing date the 3rd day of December last,\r\npurporting to be an agreement between the United States and one Bernard\r\nKock for immigration of persons of African extraction to a dependency\r\nof the Republic of Haiti, was signed by me on behalf of the party of the\r\nfirst part; but whereas the said instrument was and has since remained\r\nincomplete in consequence of the seal of the United States not having been\r\nthereunto affixed; and whereas I have been moved by considerations by me\r\ndeemed sufficient to withhold my authority for affixing the said seal:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, do hereby authorize the Secretary of State to cancel my\r\nsignature to the instrument aforesaid.\r\n\r\nDone at Washington, this sixteenth day of April, A.D. 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, APRIL 23, 1863 10.10am\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of the 21st received. I really cannot say that I have\r\nheard any complaint of you. I have heard complaint of a police corps at\r\nNashville, but your name was not mentioned in connection with it, so far\r\nas I remember. It may be that by inference you are connected with it, but\r\nmy attention has never been drawn to it in that light.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., April 27, 1863. 3.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nHow does it look now?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, April 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. A. O. CURTIN, Harrisburg, Penn.:\r\n\r\nI do not think the people of Pennsylvania should be uneasy about an\r\ninvasion. Doubtless a small force of the enemy is flourishing about in\r\nthe northern part of Virginia, on the \"skewhorn\" principle, on purpose to\r\ndivert us in another quarter. I believe it is nothing more. We think we\r\nhave adequate force close after them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO W. A. NEWELL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 29, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. W. A. NEWELL, Allentown, N.J.:\r\n\r\nI have some trouble about provost-marshal in your first district.\r\nPlease procure HON. Mr. Starr to come with you and see me, or come to an\r\nagreement with him and telegraph me the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MAY 1, 1863\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg, Penn.:\r\n\r\nThe whole disposable force at Baltimore and else where in reach have\r\nalready been sent after the enemy which alarms you. The worst thing the\r\nenemy could do for himself would be to weaken himself before Hooker, and\r\ntherefore it is safe to believe he is not doing it; and the best thing\r\nhe could do for himself would be to get us so scared as to bring part\r\nof Hooker's force away, and that is just what he is trying to do. I will\r\ntelegraph you in the morning about calling out the militia.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MAY 2, 1863\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg, Penn.:\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck tells me he has a despatch from General Schenck this\r\nmorning, informing him that our forces have joined, and that the enemy\r\nmenacing Pennsylvania will have to fight or run today. I hope I am not\r\nless anxious to do my duty to Pennsylvania than yourself, but I really\r\ndo not yet see the justification for incurring the trouble and expense of\r\ncalling out the militia. I shall keep watch, and try to do my duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN P. S.--Our forces are exactly between the enemy and\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL D.

P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nWe have through General Dix the contents of Richmond papers of the 5th.\r\nGeneral Dix's despatch in full is going to you by Captain Fox of the navy.\r\nThe substance is General Lee's despatch of the 3d (Sunday), claiming\r\nthat he had beaten you and that you were then retreating across the\r\nRappahannock, distinctly stating that two of Longstreet's divisions fought\r\nyou on Saturday, and that General [E. F.] Paxton was killed, Stonewall\r\nJackson severely wounded, and Generals Heth and A. P. Hill slightly\r\nwounded. The Richmond papers also stated, upon what authority not\r\nmentioned, that our cavalry have been at Ashland, Hanover Court-House,\r\nand other points, destroying several locomotives and a good deal of other\r\nproperty, and all the railroad bridges to within five miles of Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

This, with the great rain of yesterday and last night securing\r\nyour right flank, I think puts a new face upon your case; but you must be\r\nthe judge.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

HOOKER.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The recent movement of your army is ended without effecting\r\nits object, except, perhaps, some important breakings of the enemy's\r\ncommunications. What next? If possible, I would be very glad of another\r\nmovement early enough to give us some benefit from the fact of the enemy's\r\ncommunication being broken; but neither for this reason nor any other do\r\nI wish anything done in desperation or rashness. An early movement would\r\nalso help to supersede the bad moral effect of there certain, which is\r\nsaid to be considerably injurious. Have you already in your mind a plan\r\nwholly or partially formed? If you have, prosecute it without interference\r\nfrom me. If you have not, please inform me, so that I, incompetent as I\r\nmay be, can try and assist in the formation of some plan for the army.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C. May 8, 1863. 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nThe news is here of the capture by our forces of Grand Gulf--a large and\r\nvery important thing. General Willich, an exchanged prisoner just from\r\nRichmond, has talked with me this morning. He was there when our cavalry\r\ncut the roads in that vicinity. He says there was not a sound pair of legs\r\nin Richmond, and that our men, had they known it, could have safely\r\ngone in and burned everything and brought in Jeff Davis. We captured and\r\nparoled 300 or 400 men. He says as he came to City Point there was an army\r\nthree miles long (Longstreet's, he thought) moving toward Richmond.\r\n\r\nMuroy has captured a despatch of General Lee, in which he says his loss\r\nwas fearful in his last battle with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 9,1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL DIX:\r\n\r\nIt is very important for Hooker to know exactly what damage is done to\r\nthe railroads at all points between Fredericksburg and Richmond. As yet we\r\nhave no word as to whether the crossings of the North and South Anna, or\r\nany of them, have been touched. There are four of these Crossings;\r\nthat is, one on each road on each stream. You readily perceive why this\r\ninformation is desired. I suppose Kilpatrick or Davis can tell. Please\r\nascertain fully what was done, and what is the present condition, as near\r\nas you can, and advise me at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 9, 1863\r\n\r\nI believe Mr. L. is a good man, but two things need to be remembered.\r\n\r\n1st. Mr. R.'s rival was a relative of Mr. L.\r\n\r\n2d. I hear of nobody calling Mr. R. a \"Copperhead,\" but Mr. L. However,\r\nlet us watch.\r\n\r\nA. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, MAY 11, 1863\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I have again concluded to relieve General Curtis. I see no\r\nother way to avoid the worst consequences there. I think of General\r\nSchofield as his successor, but I do not wish to take the matter of a\r\nsuccessor out of the hands of yourself and General Halleck.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, May 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL DIX:\r\n\r\nDo the Richmond papers have anything about Grand Gulf or Vicksburg?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTTERFIELD.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, May 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTTERFIELD:\r\n\r\nAbout what distance is it from the observatory we stopped at last Thursday\r\nto the line of enemies' works you ranged the glass upon for me?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR SEYMOUR, Albany, N.Y.:\r\n\r\nDr. Swinburne and Mr. Gillett are here, having been refused, as they say,\r\nby the War Department, permission to go to the Army of the Potomac. They\r\nnow appeal to me, saying you wish them to go. I suppose they have been\r\nexcluded by a rule which experience has induced the department to deem\r\nproper; still they shall have leave to go, if you say you desire it.\r\nPlease answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO A. G. HENRY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON May 13,1863.\r\n\r\nDr. A. G. HENRY, Metropolitan Hotel, New York:\r\n\r\nGovernor Chase's feelings were hurt by my action in his absence. Smith is\r\nremoved, but Governor Chase wishes to name his successor, and asks a day\r\nor two to make the designation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.C. May 14, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER, Commanding.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--When I wrote on the 7th, I had an impression that possibly\r\nby an early movement you could get some advantage from the supposed facts\r\nthat the enemy's communications were disturbed and that he was somewhat\r\nderanged in position. That idea has now passed away, the enemy having\r\nre-established his communications, regained his positions, and actually\r\nreceived reinforcements. It does not now appear probable to me that\r\nyou can gain anything by an early renewal of the attempt to cross the\r\nRappahannock. I therefore shall not complain if you do no more for a time\r\nthan to keep the enemy at bay and out of other mischief by menaces and\r\noccasional cavalry raids, if practicable, and to put your own army in good\r\ncondition again. Still, if in your own clear judgment you can renew the\r\nattack successfully, I do not mean to restrain you. Bearing upon this last\r\npoint, I must tell you that I have some painful intimations that some\r\nof your corps and division commanders are not giving you their entire\r\nconfidence. This would be ruinous, if true, and you should therefore,\r\nfirst of all, ascertain the real facts beyond all possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTIONAL QUARRELS\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO H. T. BLOW AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. H. T. BLOW, C. D. DRAKE, AND OTHERS, St. Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day is just received. It is very painful to me that\r\nyou in Missouri cannot or will not settle your factional quarrel among\r\nyourselves. I have been tormented with it beyond endurance for months\r\nby both sides. Neither side pays the least respect to my appeals to your\r\nreason. I am now compelled to take hold of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO JAMES GUTHRIE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, May 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES GUTHRIE, Louisville, Ky.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day is received. I personally know nothing of Colonel\r\nChurchill, but months ago and more than once he has been represented to me\r\nas exerting a mischievous influence at Saint Louis, for which reason I\r\nam unwilling to force his continuance there against the judgment of our\r\nfriends on the ground; but if it will oblige you, he may come to and\r\nremain at Louisville upon taking the oath of allegiance, and your pledge\r\nfor his good behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, May 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The commander of the Department at St. Louis has ordered\r\nseveral persons south of our military lines, which order is not\r\ndisapproved by me. Yet at the special request of the HON. James Guthrie\r\nI have consented to one of the number, Samuel Churchill, remaining at\r\nLouisville, Ky., upon condition of his taking the oath of allegiance and\r\nMr. Gutlirie's word of honor for his good behavior.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDERS SENDING C. L. VALLANDIGHAM BEYOND MILITARY LINES.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH, May 10, 1863. By telegraph from\r\nWashington, 9.40 PM, 1863\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Commanding Department of Ohio.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The President directs that without delay you send C. L. Vallandigham\r\nunder secure guard to the Headquarters of General Rosecrans, to be put by\r\nhim beyond our military lines; and in case of his return within our lines,\r\nhe be arrested and kept in close custody for the term specified in his\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:  E. R. S. CANBY, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL A. B. BURNSIDE, Commanding Department of Ohio, Cincinnati,\r\nO.\r\n\r\nYour despatch of three o'clock this afternoon to the Secretary of War has\r\nbeen received and shown to the President. He thinks the best disposition\r\nto be made of Vallandigham is to put him beyond the lines, as directed in\r\nthe order transmitted to you last evening, and directs that you execute\r\nthat order by sending him forward under secure guard without delay to\r\nGeneral Rosecrans.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:  ED. R. S. CANBY, Brigadier-General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday in regard to Colonel Haggard is received. I am anxious\r\nthat you shall not misunderstand me. In no case have I intended to censure\r\nyou or to question your ability. In Colonel Haggard's case I meant no more\r\nthan to suggest that possibly you might have been mistaken in a point that\r\ncould [be] corrected. I frequently make mistakes myself in the many things\r\nI am compelled to do hastily.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 21, 1863. 4.40 PM.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS:\r\n\r\nFor certain reasons it is thought best for Rev. Dr. Jaquess not to come\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nPresent my respects to him, and ask him to write me fully on the subject\r\nhe has in contemplation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. A. HURLBUT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HURLBUT, Memphis, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nWe have news here in the Richmond newspapers of 20th and 21st, including\r\na despatch from General Joe Johnston himself, that on the 15th or 16th--a\r\nlittle confusion as to the day--Grant beat Pemberton and [W. W.] Loring\r\nnear Edwards Station, at the end of a nine hours' fight, driving Pemberton\r\nover the Big Black and cutting Loring off and driving him south to Crystal\r\nSprings, twenty-five miles below Jackson. Joe Johnston telegraphed\r\nall this, except about Loring, from his camp between Brownsville and\r\nLexington, on the 18th. Another despatch indicates that Grant was moving\r\nagainst Johnston on the 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO ANSON STAGER.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., May 24, 1863.10.40\r\n\r\nANSON STAGER, Cleveland, O.:\r\n\r\nLate last night Fuller telegraphed you, as you say, that \"the Stars and\r\nStripes float over Vicksburg and the victory is complete.\" Did he know\r\nwhat he said, or did he say it without knowing it? Your despatch of this\r\nafternoon throws doubt upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO COLONEL HAGGARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON. May 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL HAGGARD, Nashville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch to Green Adams has just been shown me. General Rosecrans\r\nknows better than we can know here who should be in charge of the Fifth\r\nCavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., May 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, O.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch about Campbell, Lyle, and others received and postponement\r\nordered by you approved. I will consider and telegraph you again in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHENCK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nLet the execution of William B. Compton be respited or suspended till\r\nfurther order from me, holding him in safe custody meanwhile. On receiving\r\nthis notify me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 27,1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR BUCKINGHAM, Hartford, Conn.:\r\n\r\nThe execution of Warren Whitemarch is hereby respited or suspended\r\nuntil further order from me, he to be held in safe custody meanwhile. On\r\nreceiving this notify me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 27,1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nHave you anything from Grant? Where is Forrest's headquarters?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON May 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Having relieved General Curtis and assigned you to the\r\ncommand of the Department of the Missouri, I think it may be of some\r\nadvantage for me to state why I did it. I did not relieve General Curtis\r\nbecause of any full conviction that he had done wrong by commission or\r\nomission. I did it because of a conviction in my mind that the Union\r\nmen of Missouri, constituting, when united, a vast majority of the\r\nwhole people, have entered into a pestilent factional quarrel among\r\nthemselves--General Curtis, perhaps not of choice, being the head of one\r\nfaction and Governor Gamble that of the other. After months of labor to\r\nreconcile the difficulty, it seemed to grow worse and worse, until I felt\r\nit my duty to break it up somehow; and as I could not remove Governor\r\nGamble, I had to remove General Curtis. Now that you are in the position,\r\nI wish you to undo nothing merely because General Curtis or Governor\r\nGamble did it, but to exercise your own judgment, and do right for the\r\npublic interest. Let your military measures be strong enough to repel the\r\ninvader and keep the peace, and not so strong as to unnecessarily harass\r\nand persecute the people. It is a difficult role, and so much greater will\r\nbe the honor if you perform it well. If both factions, or neither, shall\r\nabuse you, you will probably be about right. Beware of being assailed by\r\none and praised by the other.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 27, 1863.11 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nHave you Richmond papers of this morning? If so, what news?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ERASTUS CORNING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. ERASTUS CORNING, Albany, N.Y.:\r\n\r\nThe letter of yourself and others dated the 19th and inclosing the\r\nresolutions of a public meeting held at Albany on the 16th, was received\r\nnight before last. I shall give the resolutions the consideration you ask,\r\nand shall try to find time and make a respectful response.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn..\r\n\r\nI would not push you to any rashness, but I am very anxious that you do\r\nyour utmost, short of rashness, to keep Bragg from getting off to help\r\nJohnston against Grant.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR ANDREW JOHNSON, Louisville, Ky.:\r\n\r\nGeneral Burnside has been frequently informed lately that the division\r\nunder General Getty cannot be spared. I am sorry to have to tell you this,\r\nbut it is true, and cannot be helped.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. K.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, O.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day received. When I shall wish to supersede you I\r\nwill let you know. All the Cabinet regretted the necessity of arresting,\r\nfor instance, Vallandigham, some perhaps doubting there was a real\r\nnecessity for it; but, being done, all were for seeing you through with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Is he coming toward you\r\nor going farther off? Is there or has there been anything to hinder his\r\ncoming directly to you by water from Alexandria?\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

[Cipher.] EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\nJune 4,1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nLet execution of sentences in the cases of Daily, Margraf, and Harrington\r\nbe respited till further orders from me, they remaining in close custody\r\nmeanwhile.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTTERFIELD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., June 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTTERFIELD:\r\n\r\nThe news you send me from the Richmond Sentinel of the 3d must be greatly\r\nif not wholly incorrect. The Thursday mentioned was the 28th, and we have\r\ndespatches here directly from Vicksburg of the 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st;\r\nand, while they speak of the siege progressing, they speak of no assault\r\nor general fighting whatever, and in fact they so speak as to almost\r\nexclude the idea that there can have been any since Monday the 25th, which\r\nwas not very heavy. Neither do they mention any demand made by Grant\r\nupon Pemberton for a surrender. They speak of our troops as being in good\r\nhealth, condition, and spirits. Some of them do say that Banks has Port\r\nHudson invested.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have received additional despatches, which, with\r\nformer ones, induce me to believe we should revoke or suspend the order\r\nsuspending the Chicago Times; and if you concur in opinion, please have it\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C. JUNE 5, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day was received an hour ago. So much of professional military\r\nskill is requisite to answer it that I have turned the task over to\r\nGeneral Halleck. He promises to perform it with his utmost care. I have\r\nbut one idea which I think worth suggesting to you, and that is, in case\r\nyou find Lee coming to the north of the Rappahannock, I would by no\r\nmeans cross to the south of it. If he should leave a rear force\r\nat Fredericksburg, tempting you to fall upon it, it would fight in\r\nentrenchments and have you at advantage, and so, man for man, worst you at\r\nthat point, While his main force would in some way be getting an advantage\r\nof you northward. In one word, I would not take any risk of being\r\nentangled up on the river like an ox jumped half over a fence and liable\r\nto be torn by dogs front and rear without a fair chance to gore one way or\r\nto kick the other.\r\n\r\nIf Lee would come to my side of the river I would keep on the same side\r\nand fight him, or act on the defensive, according as might be my estimate\r\nof his strength relatively to my own. But these are mere suggestions,\r\nwhich I desire to be controlled by the judgment of yourself and General\r\nHalleck.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS.

Now we here have a despatch\r\nfrom there Sunday and others of almost every day preceding since the\r\ninvestment, and while they show the siege progressing they do not show any\r\ngeneral fighting since the 21st and 22d.

If you had\r\nRichmond invested to-day you would not be able to take it in twenty days;\r\nmeanwhile your communications, and with them your army, would be ruined.\r\nI think Lee's army, and not Richmond, is your true objective point.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ERASTUS CORNING AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. ERASTUS CORNING AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter of May 19, inclosing the resolutions of a public\r\nmeeting held at Albany, New York, on the 16th of the same month, was\r\nreceived several days ago.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions, as I understand them, are resolvable into two\r\npropositions--first, the expression of a purpose to sustain the cause\r\nof the Union, to secure peace through victory, and to support the\r\nadministration in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the\r\nrebellion; and, secondly, a declaration of censure upon the administration\r\nfor supposed unconstitutional action, such as the making of military\r\narrests. And from the two propositions a third is deduced, which is that\r\nthe gentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on doing their part\r\nto maintain our common government and country, despite the folly or\r\nwickedness, as they may conceive, of any administration. This position is\r\neminently patriotic, and as such I thank the meeting, and congratulate the\r\nnation for it. My own purpose is the same; so that the meeting and myself\r\nhave a common object, and can have no difference, except in the choice of\r\nmeans or measures for effecting that object.\r\n\r\nAnd here I ought to close this paper, and would close it, if there were no\r\napprehension that more injurious consequences than any merely personal\r\nto myself might follow the censures systematically cast upon me for doing\r\nwhat, in my view of duty, I could not forbear. The resolutions promise\r\nto support me in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the\r\nrebellion; and I have not knowingly employed, nor shall knowingly employ,\r\nany other. But the meeting, by their resolutions, assert and argue that\r\ncertain military arrests, and proceedings following them, for which I am\r\nultimately responsible, are unconstitutional. I think they are not. The\r\nresolutions quote from the Constitution the definition of treason, and\r\nalso the limiting safeguards and guarantees therein provided for the\r\ncitizen on trial for treason, and on his being held to answer for capital\r\nor otherwise infamous crimes, and in criminal prosecutions his right to\r\na speedy and public trial by an impartial jury. They proceed to\r\nresolve \"that these safeguards of the rights of the citizen against the\r\npretensions of arbitrary power were intended more especially for his\r\nprotection in times of civil commotion.\" And, apparently to demonstrate\r\nthe proposition, the resolutions proceed: \"They were secured substantially\r\nto the English people after years of protracted civil war, and were\r\nadopted into our Constitution at the close of the Revolution.\" Would not\r\nthe demonstration have been better if it could have been truly said that\r\nthese safeguards had been adopted and applied during the civil wars and\r\nduring our Revolution, instead of after the one and at the close of the\r\nother? I too am devotedly for them after civil war, and before Civil war,\r\nand at all times, \"except when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the\r\npublic safety may require\" their suspension. The resolutions proceed to\r\ntell us that these safeguards \"have stood the test of seventy-six years\r\nof trial under our republican system, under circumstances which show that,\r\nwhile they constitute the foundation of all free government, they are the\r\nelements of the enduring stability of the republic.\" No one denies that\r\nthey have so stood the test up to the beginning of the present rebellion,\r\nif we except a certain occurrence at New Orleans hereafter to be\r\nmentioned; nor does any one question that they will stand the same test\r\nmuch longer after the rebellion closes. But these provisions of the\r\nConstitution have no application to the case we have in hand, because\r\nthe arrests complained of were not made for treason--that is, not for the\r\ntreason defined in the Constitution, and upon the conviction of which the\r\npunishment is death--nor yet were they made to hold persons to answer\r\nfor any capital or otherwise infamous crimes; nor were the proceedings\r\nfollowing, in any constitutional or legal sense, \"criminal prosecutions.\"\r\nThe arrests were made on totally different grounds, and the proceedings\r\nfollowing accorded with the grounds of the arrests. Let us consider the\r\nreal case with which we are dealing, and apply to it the parts of the\r\nConstitution plainly made for such cases.\r\n\r\nPrior to my installation here it had been inculcated that any State had\r\na lawful right to secede from the national Union, and that it would be\r\nexpedient to exercise the right whenever the devotees of the doctrine\r\nshould fail to elect a president to their own liking. I was elected\r\ncontrary to their liking; and accordingly, so far as it was legally\r\npossible, they had taken seven States out of the Union, had seized many\r\nof the United States forts, and had fired upon the United States flag, all\r\nbefore I was inaugurated, and, of course, before I had done any official\r\nact whatever. The rebellion thus begun soon ran into the present civil\r\nwar; and, in certain respects, it began on very unequal terms between the\r\nparties. The insurgents had been preparing for it more than thirty years,\r\nwhile the government had taken no steps to resist them. The former had\r\ncarefully considered all the means which could be turned to their account.\r\nIt undoubtedly was a well-pondered reliance with them that in their own\r\nunrestricted effort to destroy Union, Constitution and law, all together,\r\nthe government would, in great degree, be restrained by the same\r\nConstitution and law from arresting their progress. Their sympathizers\r\ninvaded all departments of the government and nearly all communities\r\nof the people. From this material, under cover of \"liberty of speech,\"\r\n\"liberty of the press,\" and \"habeas corpus,\" they hoped to keep on foot\r\namongst us a most efficient corps of spies, informers, suppliers, and\r\naiders and abettors of their cause in a thousand ways. They knew that\r\nin times such as they were inaugurating, by the Constitution itself the\r\n\"habeas corpus\" might be suspended; but they also knew they had friends\r\nwho would make a question as to who was to suspend it; meanwhile their\r\nspies and others might remain at large to help on their cause. Or if, as\r\nhas happened, the Executive should suspend the writ without ruinous waste\r\nof time, instances of arresting innocent persons might occur, as are\r\nalways likely to occur in such cases; and then a clamor could be raised in\r\nregard to this, which might be at least of some service to the insurgent\r\ncause. It needed no very keen perception to discover this part of the\r\nenemies program, so soon as by open hostilities their machinery was fairly\r\nput in motion. Yet, thoroughly imbued with a reverence for the guaranteed\r\nrights of individuals, I was slow to adopt the strong measures which by\r\ndegrees I have been forced to regard as being within the exceptions of the\r\nConstitution, and as indispensable to the public safety. Nothing is better\r\nknown to history than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent to\r\nsuch cases. Civil courts are organized chiefly for trials of\r\nindividuals--or, at most, a few individuals acting in concert, and this in\r\nquiet times, and on charges of crimes well defined in the law. Even in\r\ntimes of peace bands of horse-thieves and robbers frequently grow too\r\nnumerous and powerful for the ordinary courts of justice. But what\r\ncomparison, in numbers have such bands ever borne to the insurgent\r\nsympathizers even in many of the loyal States? Again, a jury too\r\nfrequently has at least one member more ready to hang the panel than to\r\nhang the traitor. And yet again, he who dissuades one man from\r\nvolunteering, or induces one soldier to desert, weakens the Union cause as\r\nmuch as he who kills a Union soldier in battle. Yet this dissuasion or\r\ninducement may be so conducted as to be no defined crime of which any\r\ncivil court would take cognizance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOurs is a case of rebellion--so called by the resolutions before me--in\r\nfact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion; and the provision\r\nof the Constitution that \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus\r\nshall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the\r\npublic safety may require it,\" is the provision which specially applies\r\nto our present case. This provision plainly attests the understanding\r\nof those who made the Constitution that ordinary courts of justice are\r\ninadequate to \"cases of rebellion\"--attests their purpose that, in such\r\ncases, men may be held in custody whom the courts, acting on ordinary\r\nrules, would discharge. Habeas corpus does not discharge men who are\r\nproved to be guilty of defined crime, and its suspension is allowed by the\r\nConstitution on purpose that men may be arrested and held who can not\r\nbe proved to be guilty of defined crime, \"when, in cases of rebellion or\r\ninvasion, the public safety may require it.\"\r\n\r\nThis is precisely our present case--a case of rebellion wherein the public\r\nsafety does require the suspension--Indeed, arrests by process of courts\r\nand arrests in cases of rebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same\r\nbasis. The former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and\r\ncontinuous perpetration of crime, while the latter is directed at sudden\r\nand extensive uprisings against the government, which, at most, will\r\nsucceed or fail in no great length of time. In the latter case arrests\r\nare made not so much for what has been done as for what probably would be\r\ndone. The latter is more for the preventive and less for the vindictive\r\nthan the former. In such cases the purposes of men are much more easily\r\nunderstood than in cases of ordinary crime. The man who stands by and\r\nsays nothing when the peril of his government is discussed, cannot be\r\nmisunderstood. If not hindered, he is sure to help the enemy; much more\r\nif he talks ambiguously--talks for his country with \"buts,\" and \"ifs,\"\r\nand \"ands.\" Of how little value the constitutional provision I have quoted\r\nwill be rendered if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall\r\nhave been committed, may be illustrated by a few notable examples: General\r\nJohn C. Breckinridge, General Robert E. Lee, General Joseph E. Johnston,\r\nGeneral John B. Magruder, General William B. Preston, General Simon B.\r\nBuckner, and Commodore Franklin Buchanan, now occupying the very highest\r\nplaces in the rebel war service, were all within the power of the\r\ngovernment since the rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to\r\nbe traitors then as now. Unquestionably if we had seized and had them\r\nthe insurgent cause would be much weaker. But no one of them had then\r\ncommitted any crime defined in the law. Every one of them, if arrested,\r\nwould have been discharged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to\r\noperate. In view of these and similar cases, I think the time not unlikely\r\nto come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than\r\ntoo many.\r\n\r\nBy the third resolution the meeting indicate their opinion that military\r\narrests may be constitutional in localities where rebellion actually\r\nexists, but that such arrests are unconstitutional in localities where\r\nrebellion or insurrection does not actually exist. They insist that such\r\narrests shall not be made \"outside of the lines of necessary military\r\noccupation and the scenes of insurrection.\" Inasmuch, however, as the\r\nConstitution itself makes no such distinction, I am unable to believe that\r\nthere is any such constitutional distinction. I concede that the class\r\nof arrests complained of can be constitutional only when, in cases of\r\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety may require them; and I insist\r\nthat in such cases--they are constitutional wherever the public safety\r\ndoes require them, as well in places to which they may prevent the\r\nrebellion extending, as in those where it may be already prevailing; as\r\nwell where they may restrain mischievous interference with the raising and\r\nsupplying of armies to suppress the rebellion as where the rebellion may\r\nactually be; as well where they may restrain the enticing men out of\r\nthe army as where they would prevent mutiny in the army; equally\r\nconstitutional at all places where they will conduce to the public safety\r\nas against the dangers of rebellion or invasion. Take the particular\r\ncase mentioned by the meeting. It is asserted in substance that Mr.\r\nVallandigham was, by a military commander, seized and tried \"for no other\r\nreason than words addressed to a public meeting in criticism of the course\r\nof the administration, and in condemnation of the military orders of the\r\ngeneral.\" Now, if there be no mistake about this, if this assertion is the\r\ntruth, and the whole truth, if there were no other reason for the arrest,\r\nthen I concede that the arrest was wrong. But the arrest, as I understand,\r\nwas made for a very different reason. Mr. Vallandigham avows his hostility\r\nto the war on the part of the Union; and his arrest was made because\r\nhe was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops, to\r\nencourage desertions from the army, and to leave the rebellion without an\r\nadequate military force to suppress it. He was not arrested because he\r\nwas damaging the political prospects of the administration or the personal\r\ninterests of the commanding general, but because he was damaging the army,\r\nupon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends. He\r\nwas warring upon the military, and thus gave the military constitutional\r\njurisdiction to lay hands upon him. If Mr. Vallandigham was not damaging\r\nthe military power of the country, then his arrest was made on mistake\r\nof fact, which I would be glad to correct on reasonably satisfactory\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nI understand the meeting whose resolutions I am considering to be in favor\r\nof suppressing the rebellion by military force--by armies. Long experience\r\nhas shown that armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be\r\npunished by the severe penalty of death. The case requires, and the law\r\nand the Constitution sanction, this punishment. Must I shoot a\r\nsimple-minded boy and not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induced him\r\nto desert. This is none the less injurious when effected by getting a\r\nfather, or brother, or friend into a public meeting, and there working\r\nupon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he is\r\nfighting in a bad cause, for a wicked administration of a contemptible\r\ngovernment, too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall desert. I think\r\nthat, in such a case, to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only\r\nconstitutional, but withal a great mercy.\r\n\r\nIf I be wrong on this question of constitutional power, my error lies in\r\nbelieving that certain proceedings are constitutional when, in cases of\r\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety requires them, which would not\r\nbe constitutional when, in absence of rebellion or invasion, the public\r\nsafety does not require them: in other words, that the Constitution is\r\nnot in its application in all respects the same in cases of rebellion or\r\ninvasion involving the public safety as it is in times of profound peace\r\nand public security. The Constitution itself makes the distinction, and I\r\ncan no more be persuaded that the government can constitutionally take\r\nno strong measures in time of rebellion, because it can be shown that\r\nthe same could not be lawfully taken in times of peace, than I can be\r\npersuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man\r\nbecause it can be shown to not be good food for a well one. Nor am I able\r\nto appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting, that the American\r\npeople will by means of military arrests during the rebellion lose the\r\nright of public discussion, the liberty of speech and the press, the law\r\nof evidence, trial by jury, and habeas corpus throughout the indefinite\r\npeaceful future which I trust lies before them, any more than I am able to\r\nbelieve that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during\r\ntemporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder\r\nof his healthful life.\r\n\r\nIn giving the resolutions that earnest consideration which you request of\r\nme, I cannot overlook the fact that the meeting speak as \"Democrats.\"\r\nNor can I, with full respect for their known intelligence, and the fairly\r\npresumed deliberation with which they prepared their resolutions, be\r\npermitted to suppose that this occurred by accident, or in any way other\r\nthan that they preferred to designate themselves \"Democrats\" rather than\r\n\"American citizens.\" In this time of national peril I would have preferred\r\nto meet you upon a level one step higher than any party platform, because\r\nI am sure that from such more elevated position we could do better battle\r\nfor the country we all love than we possibly can from those lower ones\r\nwhere, from the force of habit, the prejudices of the past, and selfish\r\nhopes of the future, we are sure to expend much of our ingenuity and\r\nstrength in finding fault with and aiming blows at each other. But since\r\nyou have denied me this I will yet be thankful for the country's sake that\r\nnot all Democrats have done so. He on whose discretionary judgment Mr.\r\nVallandigham was arrested and tried is a Democrat, having no old party\r\naffinity with me, and the judge who rejected the constitutional view\r\nexpressed in these resolutions, by refusing to discharge Mr. Vallandigham\r\non habeas corpus is a Democrat of better days than these, having received\r\nhis judicial mantle at the hands of President Jackson. And still more: of\r\nall those Democrats who are nobly exposing their lives and shedding their\r\nblood on the battle-field, I have learned that many approve the course\r\ntaken with Mr. Vallandigham, while I have not heard of a single one\r\ncondemning it. I cannot assert that there are none such. And the name\r\nof President Jackson recalls an instance of pertinent history. After the\r\nbattle of New Orleans, and while the fact that the treaty of peace had\r\nbeen concluded was well known in the city, but before official knowledge\r\nof it had arrived, General Jackson still maintained martial or military\r\nlaw. Now that it could be said that the war was over, the clamor against\r\nmartial law, which had existed from the first, grew more furious. Among\r\nother things, a Mr. Louaillier published a denunciatory newspaper article.\r\nGeneral Jackson arrested him. A lawyer by the name of Morel procured the\r\nUnited States Judge Hall to order a writ of habeas corpus to release Mr.\r\nLouaillier. General Jackson arrested both the lawyer and the judge. A Mr.\r\nHollander ventured to say of some part of the matter that \"it was a dirty\r\ntrick.\" General Jackson arrested him. When the officer undertook to serve\r\nthe writ of habeas corpus, General Jackson took it from him, and sent him\r\naway with a copy. Holding the judge in custody a few days, the general\r\nsent him beyond the limits of his encampment, and set him at liberty with\r\nan order to remain till the ratification of peace should be regularly\r\nannounced, or until the British should have left the southern coast. A day\r\nor two more elapsed, the ratification of the treaty of peace was regularly\r\nannounced, and the judge and others were fully liberated. A few days more,\r\nand the judge called General Jackson into court and fined him $1000 for\r\nhaving arrested him and the others named. The General paid the fine, and\r\nthen the matter rested for nearly thirty years, when Congress refunded\r\nprincipal and interest. The late Senator Douglas, then in the House\r\nof Representatives, took a leading part in the debates, in which the\r\nconstitutional question was much discussed. I am not prepared to say whom\r\nthe journals would show to have voted for the measure.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked--first, that we had the same Constitution then as now;\r\nsecondly, that we then had a case of invasion, and now we have a case of\r\nrebellion; and, thirdly, that the permanent right of the people to public\r\ndiscussion, the liberty of speech and of the press, the trial by jury, the\r\nlaw of evidence, and the habeas corpus suffered no detriment whatever\r\nby that conduct of General Jackson, or its subsequent approval by the\r\nAmerican Congress.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, let me say that, in my own discretion, I do not know whether I\r\nwould have ordered the arrest of Mr. Vallandigham. While I cannot shift\r\nthe responsibility from myself, I hold that, as a general rule, the\r\ncommander in the field is the better judge of the necessity in any\r\nparticular case. Of course I must practice a general directory and\r\nrevisory power in the matter.\r\n\r\nOne of the resolutions expresses the opinion of the meeting that arbitrary\r\narrests will have the effect to divide and distract those who should be\r\nunited in suppressing the rebellion, and I am specifically called on to\r\ndischarge Mr. Vallandigham. I regard this as, at least, a fair appeal to\r\nme on the expediency of exercising a constitutional power which I think\r\nexists. In response to such appeal I have to say, it gave me pain when\r\nI learned that Mr. Vallandigham had been arrested (that is, I was pained\r\nthat there should have seemed to be a necessity for arresting him), and\r\nthat it will afford me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as I can by\r\nany means believe the public safety will not suffer by it.\r\n\r\nI further say that, as the war progresses, it appears to me, opinion and\r\naction, which were in great confusion at first, take shape and fall into\r\nmore regular channels, so that the necessity for strong dealing with them\r\ngradually decreases. I have every reason to desire that it should cease\r\naltogether, and far from the least is my regard for the opinions and\r\nwishes of those who, like the meeting at Albany, declare their purpose\r\nto sustain the government in every constitutional and lawful measure to\r\nsuppress the rebellion. Still, I must continue to do so much as may seem\r\nto be required by the public safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

C., June 14, 1863.3.50 P.M.,\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nSo far as we can make out here, the enemy have Muroy surrounded at\r\nWinchester, and Tyler at Martinsburg. If they could hold out a few days,\r\ncould you help them? If the head of Lee's army is at Martinsburg and the\r\ntail of it on the plank-road between Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville,\r\nthe animal must be very slim somewhere; could you not break him?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. C. SCHENCK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June 14, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHENCK:\r\n\r\nGet General Milroy from Winchester to Harper's Ferry, if possible. He will\r\nbe \"gobbled up\" if he remains, if he is not already past salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President, United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEEDS NEW TIRES ON HIS CARRIAGE\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS. LINCOLN, Philadelphia, Pa.:\r\n\r\nTolerably well. Have not rode out much yet, but have at last got new tires\r\non the carriage wheels and perhaps shall ride out soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

C., June 10, 1863\r\n\r\nFREDERICK KAPP AND OTHERS, New York:\r\n\r\nThe Governor of New York promises to send us troops, and if he wishes the\r\nassistance of General Fremont and General Sigel, one or both, he can have\r\nit. If he does not wish them it would but breed confusion for us to set\r\nthem to work independently of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS. LINCOLN, Philadelphia:\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of choice with yourself whether you come home. There is\r\nno reason why you should not, that did not exist when you went away. As\r\nbearing on the question of your coming home, I do not think the raid into\r\nPennsylvania amounts to anything at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO COLONEL BLISS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nCOL. WILLIAM S. BLISS, New York Hotel:\r\n\r\nYour despatch asking whether I will accept \"the Loyal Brigade of the\r\nNorth\" is received. I never heard of that brigade by name and do not know\r\nwhere it is; yet, presuming it is in New York, I say I will gladly accept\r\nit, if tendered by and with the consent and approbation of the Governor of\r\nthat State. Otherwise not.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 16, 1863.10 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nTo remove all misunderstanding, I now place you in the strict military\r\nrelation to General Halleck of a commander of one of the armies to the\r\ngeneral-in-chief of all the armies. I have not intended differently, but\r\nas it seems to be differently understood I shall direct him to give you\r\norders and you to obey them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON D.

Attorney, Frankfort, Ky.:\r\n\r\nA Mr. Burkner is here shoving a record and asking to be discharged from a\r\nsuit in San Francisco, as bail for one Thompson. Unless the record\r\nshown me is defectively made out I think it can be successfully defended\r\nagainst. Please examine the case carefully and, if you shall be of opinion\r\nit cannot be sustained, dismiss it and relieve me from all trouble about\r\nit. Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I deeply regret that you were not renominated, not that\r\nI have aught against Mr. Brough. On the contrary, like yourself, I say\r\nhurrah for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL DINGMAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 18, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL A. DINGMAN, Belleville, C. W.:\r\n\r\nThanks for your offer of the Fifteenth Battalion. I do not think\r\nWashington is in danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO B. B. MALHIOT AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 19, 1863.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. B. B. MALHIOT, BRADISH JOHNSON, AND THOMAS COTTMAN.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter, which follows, has been received and Considered.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, a committee appointed by the planters of the State of\r\nLouisiana, respectfully represent that they have been delegated to seek of\r\nthe General Government a full recognition of all the rights of the State\r\nas they existed previous to the passage of an act of secession, upon the\r\nprinciple of the existence of the State constitution unimpaired, and no\r\nlegal act having transpired that could in any way deprive them of the\r\nadvantages conferred by that constitution. Under this constitution the\r\nState wishes to return to its full allegiance, in the enjoyment of all\r\nrights and privileges exercised by the other States under the Federal\r\nConstitution. With the view of accomplishing the desired object, we\r\nfurther request that your Excellency will, as commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy of the United States, direct the Military Governor of Louisiana to\r\norder an election, in conformity with the constitution and laws of the\r\nState, on the first Monday of November next, for all State and Federal\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n\"With high consideration and resect, we have the honor to subscribe\r\nourselves,\r\n\r\n\"Your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n     \"E. E. MALHIOT.\r\n     \"BRADISH JOHNSON.\r\n     \"THOMAS COTTMAN.\"\r\n\r\nSince receiving the letter, reliable information has reached me that a\r\nrespectable portion of the Louisiana people desire to amend their State\r\nconstitution, and contemplate holding a State convention for that object.\r\nThis fact alone, as it seems to me, is a sufficient reason why the General\r\nGovernment should not give the committal you seek to the existing State\r\nconstitution. I may add that, while I do not perceive how such committal\r\ncould facilitate our military operations in Louisiana, I really apprehend\r\nit might be so used as to embarrass them.\r\n\r\nAs to an election to be held next November, there is abundant time without\r\nany order or proclamation from me just now. The people of Louisiana shall\r\nnot lack an opportunity for a fair election for both Federal and State\r\nofficers by want of anything within my power to give them.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nJune 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD. MY DEAR SIR:--Your despatch, asking in\r\nsubstance whether, in case Missouri shall adopt gradual emancipation, the\r\nGeneral Government will protect slave owners in that species of property\r\nduring the short time it shall be permitted by the State to exist within\r\nit, has been received. Desirous as I am that emancipation shall be adopted\r\nby Missouri, and believing as I do that gradual can be made better than\r\nimmediate for both black and white, except when military necessity changes\r\nthe case, my impulse is to say that such protection would be given. I\r\ncannot know exactly what shape an act of emancipation may take. If the\r\nperiod from the initiation to the final end should be comparatively short,\r\nand the act should prevent persons being sold during that period into more\r\nlasting slavery, the whole would be easier. I do not wish to pledge the\r\nGeneral Government to the affirmative support of even temporary slavery\r\nbeyond what can be fairly claimed under the Constitution. I suppose,\r\nhowever, this is not desired, but that it is desired for the military\r\nforce of the United States, while in Missouri, to not be used in\r\nsubverting the temporarily reserved legal rights in slaves during the\r\nprogress of emancipation. This I would desire also. I have very earnestly\r\nurged the slave States to adopt emancipation; and it ought to be, and is,\r\nan object with me not to overthrow or thwart what any of them may in good\r\nfaith do to that end. You are therefore authorized to act in the spirit\r\nof this letter in conjunction with what may appear to be the military\r\nnecessities of your department. Although this letter will become public at\r\nsome time, it is not intended to be made so now.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 22, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nOperator at Leesburg just now says: \"I heard very little firing this A.M.\r\nabout daylight, but it seems to have stopped now. It was in about the same\r\ndirection as yesterday, but farther off.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nYou remember that Hon. W. D. Kelly and others are engaged in raising or\r\ntrying to raise some colored regiments in Philadelphia. The bearer of\r\nthis, Wilton M. Huput, is a friend of Judge Kelly, as appears by the\r\nletter of the latter. He is a private in the 112th Penn. and has been\r\ndisappointed in a reasonable expectation of one of the smaller offices.\r\nHe now wants to be a lieutenant in one of the colored regiments. If Judge\r\nKelly will say in writing he wishes to so have him, I am willing for him\r\nto be discharged from his present position, and be so appointed. If you\r\napprove, so indorse and let him carry the letter to Kelly.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MAJOR VAN VLIET.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR VAN VLIET, New York:\r\n\r\nHave you any idea what the news is in the despatch of General Banks to\r\nGeneral Halleck?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL COUCH.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June 24, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL COUCH, Harrisburg, Pa.:\r\n\r\nHave you any reports of the enemy moving into Pennsylvania? And if any,\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL DIX.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 24, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Yorktown, Va.:\r\n\r\nWe have a despatch from General Grant of the 19th. Don't think Kirby Smith\r\ntook Milliken's Bend since, allowing time to get the news to Joe Johnston\r\nand from him to Richmond. But it is not absolutely impossible. Also\r\nhave news from Banks to the 16th, I think. He had not run away then, nor\r\nthought of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL PECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PECK, Suffolk, Va.:\r\n\r\nColonel Derrom, of the Twenty-fifth New Jersey Volunteers, now mustered\r\nout, says there is a man in your hands under conviction for desertion,\r\nwho formerly belonged to the above named regiment, and whose name is\r\nTempleton--Isaac F. Templeton, I believe. The Colonel and others appeal to\r\nme for him. Please telegraph to me what is the condition of the case,\r\nand if he has not been executed send me the record of the trial and\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 27, 1863. 8A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nIt did not come from the newspapers, nor did I believe it, but I wished to\r\nbe entirely sure it was a falsehood.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, O.:\r\n\r\nThere is nothing going on in Kentucky on the subject of which you\r\ntelegraph, except an enrolment. Before anything is done beyond this, I\r\nwill take care to understand the case better than I now do.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BOYLE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR J. T. BOYLE, Cincinnati, O.:\r\n\r\nThere is nothing going on in Kentucky on the subject of which you\r\ntelegraph, except an enrolment.

C., June 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR GENERAL SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nEvery place in the Naval school subject to my appointment is full, and I\r\nhave one unredeemed promise of more than half a year's standing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER DEMOCRATIC PARTY CRITICISM\r\n\r\nTO M. BIRCHARD AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., June 29,1863.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. M. BIRCHARD, DAVID A. HOUK, et al:\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--The resolutions of the Ohio Democratic State convention, which\r\nyou present me, together with your introductory and closing remarks,\r\nbeing in position and argument mainly the same as the resolutions of the\r\nDemocratic meeting at Albany, New York, I refer you to my response to the\r\nlatter as meeting most of the points in the former.\r\n\r\nThis response you evidently used in preparing your remarks, and I desire\r\nno more than that it be used with accuracy. In a single reading of your\r\nremarks, I only discovered one inaccuracy in matter, which I suppose you\r\ntook from that paper. It is where you say: \"The undersigned are unable to\r\nagree with you in the opinion you have expressed that the Constitution is\r\ndifferent in time of insurrection or invasion from what it is in time of\r\npeace and public security.\"\r\n\r\nA recurrence to the paper will show you that I have not expressed the\r\nopinion you suppose. I expressed the opinion that the Constitution is\r\ndifferent in its application in cases of rebellion or invasion, involving\r\nthe public safety, from what it is in times of profound peace and\r\npublic security; and this opinion I adhere to, simply because, by the\r\nConstitution itself, things may be done in the one case which may not be\r\ndone in the other.\r\n\r\nI dislike to waste a word on a merely personal point, but I must\r\nrespectfully assure you that you will find yourselves at fault should\r\nyou ever seek for evidence to prove your assumption that I \"opposed in\r\ndiscussions before the people the policy of the Mexican war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou say: \"Expunge from the Constitution this limitation upon the power\r\nof Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, and yet the other\r\nguarantees of personal liberty would remain unchanged.\" Doubtless, if this\r\nclause of the Constitution, improperly called, as I think, a limitation\r\nupon the power of Congress, were expunged, the other guarantees would\r\nremain the same; but the question is not how those guarantees would stand\r\nwith that clause out of the Constitution, but how they stand with that\r\nclause remaining in it, in case of rebellion or invasion involving the\r\npublic safety. If the liberty could be indulged of expunging that clause,\r\nletter and spirit, I really think the constitutional argument would be\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nMy general view on this question was stated in the Albany response, and\r\nhence I do not state it now. I only add that, as seems to me, the\r\nbenefit of the writ of habeas corpus is the great means through which the\r\nguarantees of personal liberty are conserved and made available in\r\nthe last resort; and corroborative of this view is the fact that Mr.\r\nVallandigham, in the very case in question, under the advice of able\r\nlawyers, saw not where else to go but to the habeas corpus. But by the\r\nConstitution the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus itself may be\r\nsuspended when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may\r\nrequire it.\r\n\r\nYou ask, in substance, whether I really claim that I may override all the\r\nguaranteed rights of individuals, on the plea of conserving the public\r\nsafety when I may choose to say the public safety requires it. This\r\nquestion, divested of the phraseology calculated to represent me as\r\nstruggling for an arbitrary personal prerogative, is either simply a\r\nquestion who shall decide, or an affirmation that nobody shall decide,\r\nwhat the public safety does require in cases of rebellion or invasion.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution contemplates the question as likely to occur for\r\ndecision, but it does not expressly declare who is to decide it. By\r\nnecessary implication, when rebellion or invasion comes, the decision is\r\nto be made from time to time; and I think the man whom, for the time, the\r\npeople have, under the Constitution, made the commander-in-chief of their\r\narmy and navy, is the man who holds the power and bears the responsibility\r\nof making it. If he uses the power justly, the same people will probably\r\njustify him; if he abuses it, he is in their hands to be dealt with by all\r\nthe modes they have reserved to themselves in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe earnestness with which you insist that persons can only, in times\r\nof rebellion, be lawfully dealt with in accordance with the rules for\r\ncriminal trials and punishments in times of peace, induces me to add a\r\nword to what I said on that point in the Albany response.\r\n\r\nYou claim that men may, if they choose, embarrass those whose duty it is\r\nto combat a giant rebellion, and then be dealt with in turn only as if\r\nthere were no rebellion. The Constitution itself rejects this view. The\r\nmilitary arrests and detentions which have been made, including those of\r\nMr. Vallandigham, which are not different in principle from the others,\r\nhave been for prevention, and not for punishment--as injunctions to stay\r\ninjury, as proceedings to keep the peace; and hence, like proceedings\r\nin such cases and for like reasons, they have not been accompanied with\r\nindictments, or trials by juries, nor in a single case by any punishment\r\nwhatever, beyond what is purely incidental to the prevention. The original\r\nsentence of imprisonment in Mr. Vallandigham's case was to prevent injury\r\nto the military service only, and the modification of it was made as a\r\nless disagreeable mode to him of securing the same prevention.\r\n\r\nI am unable to perceive an insult to Ohio in the case of Mr. Vallandigham.\r\nQuite surely nothing of the sort was or is intended. I was wholly unaware\r\nthat Mr. Vallandigham was, at the time of his arrest, a candidate for the\r\nDemocratic nomination for governor until so informed by your reading to me\r\nthe resolutions of the convention. I am grateful to the State of Ohio for\r\nmany things, especially for the brave soldiers and officers she has given\r\nin the present national trial to the armies of the Union.\r\n\r\nYou claim, as I understand, that according to my own position in the\r\nAlbany response, Mr. Vallandigham should be released; and this because,\r\nas you claim, he has not damaged the military service by discouraging\r\nenlistments, encouraging desertions, or otherwise; and that if he had,\r\nhe should have been turned over to the civil authorities under the recent\r\nacts of Congress. I certainly do not know that Mr. Vallandigham has\r\nspecifically and by direct language advised against enlistments and in\r\nfavor of desertion and resistance to drafting.\r\n\r\nWe all know that combinations, armed in some instances, to resist the\r\narrest of deserters began several months ago; that more recently the like\r\nhas appeared in resistance to the enrolment preparatory to a draft; and\r\nthat quite a number of assassinations have occurred from the same animus.\r\nThese had to be met by military force, and this again has led to bloodshed\r\nand death. And now, under a sense of responsibility more weighty and\r\nenduring than any which is merely official, I solemnly declare my belief\r\nthat this hindrance of the military, including maiming and murder, is\r\ndue to the course in which Mr. Vallandigham has been engaged in a greater\r\ndegree than to any other cause; and it is due to him personally in a\r\ngreater degree than to any other one man.\r\n\r\nThese things have been notorious, known to all, and of course known to Mr.\r\nVallandigham. Perhaps I would not be wrong to say they originated with\r\nhis special friends and adherents. With perfect knowledge of them, he has\r\nfrequently if not constantly made speeches in Congress and before popular\r\nassemblies; and if it can be shown that, with these things staring him in\r\nthe face he has ever uttered a word of rebuke or counsel against them, it\r\nwill be a fact greatly in his favor with me, and one of which as yet I am\r\ntotally ignorant. When it is known that the whole burden of his speeches\r\nhas been to stir up men against the prosecution of the war, and that in\r\nthe midst of resistance to it he has not been known in any instance to\r\ncounsel against such resistance, it is next to impossible to repel the\r\ninference that he has counseled directly in favor of it.\r\n\r\nWith all this before their eyes, the convention you represent have\r\nnominated Mr. Vallandigham for governor of Ohio, and both they and\r\nyou have declared the purpose to sustain the national Union by all\r\nconstitutional means. But of course they and you in common reserve to\r\nyourselves to decide what are constitutional means; and, unlike the Albany\r\nmeeting, you omit to state or intimate that in your opinion an army is a\r\nconstitutional means of saving the Union against a rebellion, or even to\r\nintimate that you are conscious of an existing rebellion being in progress\r\nwith the avowed object of destroying that very Union. At the same time\r\nyour nominee for governor, in whose behalf you appeal, is known to you\r\nand to the world to declare against the use of an army to suppress the\r\nrebellion. Your own attitude, therefore, encourages desertion, resistance\r\nto the draft, and the like, because it teaches those who incline to desert\r\nand to escape the draft to believe it is your purpose to protect them, and\r\nto hope that you will become strong enough to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter a short personal intercourse with you, gentlemen of the committee,\r\nI cannot say I think you desire this effect to follow your attitude; but\r\nI assure your that both friends and enemies of the Union look upon it in\r\nthis light. It is a substantial hope, and by consequence a real strength\r\nto the enemy. If it is a false hope, and one which you would willingly\r\ndispel, I will make the way exceedingly easy.\r\n\r\nI send you duplicates of this letter in order that you, or a majority of\r\nyou, may, if you choose, indorse your names upon one of them and return it\r\nthus indorsed to me with the understanding that those signing are thereby\r\ncommitted to the following propositions and to nothing else:\r\n\r\n1. That there is now a rebellion in the United States, the object and\r\ntendency of which is to destroy the National Union; and that, in your\r\nopinion, an army and navy are constitutional means for suppressing that\r\nrebellion;\r\n\r\n2. That no one of you will do anything which, in his own judgment,\r\nwill tend to hinder the increase, or favor the decrease, or lessen the\r\nefficiency of the army or navy while engaged in the effort to suppress\r\nthat rebellion; and\r\n\r\n3. That each of you will, in his sphere, do all he can to have the\r\nofficers, soldiers, and seamen of the army and navy, while engaged in\r\nthe effort to suppress the rebellion, paid, fed, clad, and otherwise well\r\nprovided for and supported.\r\n\r\nAnd with the further understanding that upon receiving the letter and\r\nnames thus indorsed, I will cause them to be published, which publication\r\nshall be, within itself, a revocation of the order in relation to Mr.\r\nVallandigham. It will not escape observation that I consent to the release\r\nof Mr. Vallandigham upon terms not embracing any pledge from him or from\r\nothers as to what he will or will not do. I do this because he is not\r\npresent to speak for himself, or to authorize others to speak for him;\r\nand because I should expect that on his returning he would not put himself\r\npractically in antagonism with the position of his friends. But I do it\r\nchiefly because I thereby prevail on other influential gentlemen of Ohio\r\nto so define their position as to be of immense value to the army--thus\r\nmore than compensating for the consequences of any mistake in allowing Mr.\r\nVallandigham to return; so that, on the whole, the public safety will not\r\nhave suffered by it. Still, in regard to Mr. Vallandigham and all others,\r\nI must hereafter, as heretofore, do so much as the public safety may seem\r\nto require.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be respectfully yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I really think the attitude of the\r\nenemy's army in Pennsylvania presents us the best opportunity we have had\r\nsince the war began. I think you will not see the foe in New Jersey. I beg\r\nyou to be assured that no one out of my position can know so well as if\r\nhe were in it the difficulties and involvements of replacing General\r\nMcClellan in command, and this aside from any imputations upon him.\r\n\r\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for what you have done and are doing to\r\nget troops forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

HUNTER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL:--I have just received your letter of the 25th of June.\r\n\r\nI assure you, and you may feel authorized in stating, that the recent\r\nchange of commanders in the Department of the South was made for no\r\nreasons which convey any imputation upon your known energy, efficiency,\r\nand patriotism; but for causes which seemed sufficient, while they were in\r\nno degree incompatible with the respect and esteem in which I have always\r\nheld you as a man and an officer.\r\n\r\nI cannot, by giving my consent to a publication of whose details I know\r\nnothing, assume the responsibility of whatever you may write. In this\r\nmatter your own sense of military propriety must be your guide, and the\r\nregulations of the service your rule of conduct.\r\n\r\nI am very truly your friend,\r\n\r\nA.

C.,\r\nJuly 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FRENCH, Fredericktown, Md.:\r\n\r\nI see your despatch about destruction of pontoons. Cannot the enemy ford\r\nthe river?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FAILURE TO PURSUE ENEMY\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS' HOME, WASHINGTON, JULY 6 1863.7 P.M.,\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nI left the telegraph office a good deal dissatisfied. You know I did not\r\nlike the phrase--in Orders, No. 68, I believe--\"Drive the invaders from\r\nour soil.\" Since that, I see a despatch from General French, saying the\r\nenemy is crossing his wounded over the river in flats, without saying\r\nwhy he does not stop it, or even intimating a thought that it ought to\r\nbe stopped. Still later, another despatch from General Pleasonton, by\r\ndirection of General Meade, to General French, stating that the main army\r\nis halted because it is believed the rebels are concentrating \"on the\r\nroad towards Hagerstown, beyond Fairfield,\" and is not to move until it is\r\nascertained that the rebels intend to evacuate Cumberland Valley.\r\n\r\nThese things appear to me to be connected with a purpose to cover\r\nBaltimore and Washington and to get the enemy across the river again\r\nwithout a further collision, and they do not appear connected with a\r\npurpose to prevent his crossing and to destroy him. I do fear the former\r\npurpose is acted upon and the latter rejected.\r\n\r\nIf you are satisfied the latter purpose is entertained, and is judiciously\r\npursued, I am content. If you are not so satisfied, please look to it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE,\r\n\r\nJULY 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I am very glad indeed to see you to-night, and yet I\r\nwill not say I thank you for this call; but I do most sincerely thank\r\nAlmighty God for the occasion on which you have called. How long ago is it\r\nEighty-odd years since, on the Fourth of July, for the first time in the\r\nhistory of the world, a nation, by its representatives, assembled and\r\ndeclared as a self-evident truth \"that all men are created equal.\" That\r\nwas the birthday of the United States of America. Since then the Fourth\r\nof July has had several very peculiar recognitions. The two men most\r\ndistinguished in the framing and support of the Declaration were Thomas\r\nJefferson and John Adams, the one having penned it, and the other\r\nsustained it the most forcibly in debate--the only two of the fifty-five\r\nwho signed it and were elected Presidents of the United States. Precisely\r\nfifty years after they put their hands to the paper, it pleased\r\nAlmighty God to take both from this stage of action. This was indeed an\r\nextraordinary and remarkable event in our history. Another President, five\r\nyears after, was called from this stage of existence on the same day and\r\nmonth of the year; and now on this last Fourth of July just passed, when\r\nwe have a gigantic rebellion, at the bottom of which is an effort to\r\noverthrow the principle that all men were created equal, we have the\r\nsurrender of a most powerful position and army on that very day. And not\r\nonly so, but in the succession of battles in Pennsylvania, near to us,\r\nthrough three days, so rapidly fought that they might be called one great\r\nbattle, on the first, second, and third of the month of July; and on the\r\nfourth the cohorts of those who opposed the Declaration that all men are\r\ncreated equal, \"turned tail\" and run.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this is a glorious theme, and the occasion for a speech, but I\r\nam not prepared to make one worthy of the occasion. I would like to speak\r\nin terms of praise due to the many brave officers and soldiers who have\r\nfought in the cause of the Union and liberties of their country from the\r\nbeginning of the war. These are trying occasions, not only in success,\r\nbut for the want of success. I dislike to mention the name of one single\r\nofficer, lest I might do wrong to those I might forget. Recent events\r\nbring up glorious names, and particularly prominent ones; but these I will\r\nnot mention. Having said this much, I will now take the music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURRENDER OF VICKSBURG TO GENERAL GRANT\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM GENERAL HALLECK TO GENERAL G. C. MEADE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., July 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nI have received from the President the following note, which I\r\nrespectfully communicate:\r\n\r\n\"We have certain information that Vicksburg surrendered to General Grant\r\non the Fourth of July. Now if General Meade can complete his work, so\r\ngloriously prosecuted this far, by the literal or substantial destruction\r\nof Lee's army, the rebellion will be over.\r\n\r\n\"Yours truly,\r\n\r\n\"A.

C., July 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Frederick, Md.:\r\n\r\nThere is reliable information that the enemy is crossing at Williamsport.\r\nThe opportunity to attack his divided forces should not be lost. The\r\nPresident is urgent and anxious that your army should move against him by\r\nforced marches.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL THOMAS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, July 8, 1863.12.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL LORENZO THOMAS, Harrisburg, Pa.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of this morning to the Secretary of War is before me. The\r\nforces you speak of will be of no imaginable service if they cannot go\r\nforward with a little more expedition. Lee is now passing the Potomac\r\nfaster than the forces you mention are passing Carlisle. Forces now beyond\r\nCarlisle to be joined by regiments still at Harrisburg, and the united\r\nforce again to join Pierce somewhere, and the whole to move down the\r\nCumberland Valley, will in my unprofessional opinion be quite as likely to\r\ncapture the \"man in the moon\" as any part of Lee's army.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LOWE, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that General Meade, now commanding the Army of the\r\nPotomac, beat Lee at Gettysburg, Pa., at the end of a three days' battle,\r\nand that the latter is now crossing the Potomac at Williamsport over the\r\nswollen stream and with poor means of crossing, and closely pressed\r\nby Meade. We also have despatches rendering it entirely certain that\r\nVicksburg surrendered to General Grant on the glorious old 4th.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO L. SWETT AND P. F.

DUBOIS, Springfield, Ill.:\r\n\r\nIt is certain that, after three days' fighting at Gettysburg, Lee withdrew\r\nand made for the Potomac, that he found the river so swollen as to\r\nprevent his crossing; that he is still this side, near Hagerstown and\r\nWilliamsport, preparing to defend himself; and that Meade is close upon\r\nhim, and preparing to attack him, heavy skirmishing having occurred nearly\r\nall day yesterday.\r\n\r\nI am more than satisfied with what has happened north of the Potomac so\r\nfar, and am anxious and hopeful for what is to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I write to say a word further. When you\r\nfirst reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you should do what you\r\nfinally did--march the troops across the neck, run the batteries with the\r\ntransports, and thus go below; and I never had any faith except a general\r\nhope that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition and the\r\nlike could succeed. When you dropped below, and took Port Gibson, Grand\r\nGulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the river and join\r\nGeneral Banks; and when you turned northward, east of the Big Black, I\r\nfeared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the personal acknowledgment\r\nthat you were right and I was wrong.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, July 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SCHOFIELD. St. Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nI regret to learn of the arrest of the Democrat editor. I fear this loses\r\nyou the middle position I desired you to occupy. I have not learned which\r\nof the two letters I wrote you it was that the Democrat published, but I\r\ncare very little for the publication of any letter I have written.

VANCE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--My former business partner, Mr. Frederic Kidder, of Boston,\r\nhas forwarded to me a letter he has recently received from his brother,\r\nEdward Kidder, of Wilmington, in which (Edward Kidder) says that he has\r\nhad an interview with you in which you expressed an anxiety for any peace\r\ncompatible with honor; that you regard slavery as already dead, and the\r\nestablishment of the Confederacy as hopeless; and that you should exert\r\nall your influence to bring about any reunion that would admit the South\r\non terms of perfect equality with the North.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of this letter I lost no time in laying it before the President\r\nof the United States, who expressed great gratification at hearing such\r\nsentiments from you, one of the most influential and honored of the\r\nSouthern governors, and he desires me to say that he fully shares your\r\nanxiety for the restoration of peace between the States and for a reunion\r\nof all the States on the basis of the abolition of slavery--the bone we\r\nare fighting over--and the full reinstatement of every Confederate citizen\r\nin all the rights of citizenship in our common country. These points\r\nconceded, the President authorizes me to say that he will be glad to\r\nreceive overtures from any man, or body of men, who have authority to\r\ncontrol the armies of the Confederacy; and that he and the United States\r\nCongress will be found very liberal on all collateral points that may come\r\nup in the settlement.\r\n\r\nHis views on the collateral points that may naturally arise, the President\r\ndesires me to say he will communicate to you through me if you should\r\nsuggest the personal interview that Mr. Edward Kidder recommends in his\r\nletter to his brother. In that case you will please forward to me, through\r\nMr. Kidder, your official permit, as Governor of North Carolina, to enter\r\nand leave the State, and to remain in it in safety during the pendency\r\nof these negotiations, which, I suppose, should be conducted in entire\r\nsecrecy until they assume an official character. With high consideration,\r\nI am,\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nJAMES R. GILMORE.\r\n\r\n [Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nThis letter has been written in my presence, has been read by me, and has\r\nmy entire approval.

But these victories have\r\nbeen accorded not without sacrifices of life, limb, health, and liberty,\r\nincurred by brave, loyal, and patriotic citizens. Domestic affliction\r\nin every part of the country follows in the train of these fearful\r\nbereavements. It is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence\r\nof the Almighty Father, and the power of His hand equally in these\r\ntriumphs and in these sorrows.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I do set apart Thursday, the 6th day of\r\nAugust next, to be observed as a day for national thanksgiving, praise,\r\nand prayer, and I invite the people of the United States to assemble on\r\nthat occasion in their customary places of worship, and, in the forms\r\napproved by their own consciences, render the homage due to the Divine\r\nMajesty for the wonderful things He has done in the nation's behalf, and\r\ninvoke the influence of His Holy Spirit to subdue the anger which has\r\nproduced and so long sustained a needless and cruel rebellion, to change\r\nthe hearts of the insurgents, to guide the counsels of the Government with\r\nwisdom adequate to so great a national emergency, and to visit with tender\r\ncare and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our land all\r\nthose who, through the vicissitudes of marches, voyages, battles, and\r\nsieges have been, brought to suffer in mind, body, or estate, and finally\r\nto lead the whole nation through the paths of repentance and submission\r\nto the Divine Will back to the perfect enjoyment of union and fraternal\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this fifteenth day of July, in the year\r\nof our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States of America the eighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

L SWETT, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nMany persons are telegraphing me from California, begging me for the peace\r\nof the State to suspend the military enforcement of the writ of possession\r\nin the Almaden case, while you are the single one who urges the contrary.\r\nYou know I would like to oblige you, but it seems to me my duty in this\r\ncase is the other way.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LANE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Governor Carney has not asked to [have] General Blunt\r\nremoved, or interfered with, in his military operations. He has asked that\r\nhe, the Governor, be allowed to commission officers for troops raised in\r\nKansas, as other governors of loyal States do; and I think he is right in\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nHe has asked that General Blunt shall not take persons charged with civil\r\ncrimes out of the hands of the courts and turn them over to mobs to be\r\nhung; and I think he is right in this also. He has asked that General\r\nEwing's department be extended to include all Kansas; and I have not\r\ndetermined whether this is right or not.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR MORTON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July 18, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR O. P. MORTON, Indianapolis:\r\n\r\nWhat do you remember about the case of John O. Brown, convicted of\r\nmutinous conduct and sentenced to death? What do you desire about it?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR PARKER\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nJuly 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY JOEL PARKER, Governor of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 15th has been received, and considered by the\r\nSecretary of War and myself. I was pained to be informed this morning by\r\nthe Provost-Marshal-General that New Jersey is now behind twelve thousand,\r\nirrespective of the draft. I did not have time to ascertain by what rules\r\nthis was made out; and I shall be very glad if it shall, by any means,\r\nprove to be incorrect. He also tells me that eight thousand will be about\r\nthe quota of New Jersey on the first draft; and the Secretary of War\r\nsays the first draft in that State would not be made for some time in any\r\nevent. As every man obtained otherwise lessens the draft so much, and this\r\nmay supersede it altogether, I hope you will push forward your volunteer\r\nregiments as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is a very delicate matter to postpone the draft in one State, because\r\nof the argument it furnishes others to have postponement also. If we could\r\nhave a reason in one case which would be good if presented in all cases,\r\nwe could act upon it.\r\n\r\nI will thank you, therefore, to inform me, if you can, by what day, at\r\nthe earliest, you can promise to have ready to be mustered into the United\r\nStates service the eight thousand men.\r\n\r\nIf you can make a reliable promise (I mean one which you can rely on\r\nyourself) of this sort, it will be of great value, if the day is not too\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nI beg you to be assured I wish to avoid the difficulties you dread as much\r\nas yourself.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON D.C. JULY 20, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR GENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL:--I have received and read your letter of the 14th of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nI think the suggestion you make, of discontinuing proceedings against\r\nMr. McKee, a very proper one. While I admit that there is an apparent\r\nimpropriety in the publication of the letter mentioned, without my consent\r\nor yours, it is still a case where no evil could result, and which I am\r\nentirely willing to overlook.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C. JULY 22, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR GENERAL SCHOFIELD, St. Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nThe following despatch has been placed in my hands. Please look to the\r\nsubject of it.\r\n\r\nLEXINGTON, Mo., JULY 21, 1863 HON. S C. POMEROY: Under Orders No.63 the\r\nsheriff is arresting slaves of rebels inside our lines, and returning them\r\nin great numbers. Can he do it? Answer. GOULD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO POSTMASTER-GENERAL BLAIR\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJULY 24, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. POSTMASTER-GENERAL\r\n\r\nSIR:-Yesterday little indorsements of mine went to you in two cases\r\nof postmasterships sought for widows whose husbands have fallen in the\r\nbattles of this war. These cases occurring on the same day brought me to\r\nreflect more attentively than I had before done, as to what is fairly due\r\nfrom us herein the dispensing of patronage toward the men who, by fighting\r\nour battles, bear the chief burden of serving our country. My conclusion\r\nis that, other claims and qualifications being equal, they have the better\r\nright and this is especially applicable to the disabled and the soldier,\r\ndeceased soldier's family.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Certain matters have come to my notice, and considered by me, which\r\ninduce me to believe that it will conduce to the public interest for\r\nyou to add to the general instructions given to our naval commanders in\r\nrelation to contraband trade propositions substantially as follows, to\r\nwit:\r\n\r\nFirst. You will avoid the reality, and as far as possible the appearance,\r\nof using any neutral port to watch neutral vessels and then to dart out\r\nand seize them on their departure.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Complaint is made that this has been practiced at the port of St\r\nThomas, which practice, if it exists, is disapproved and must cease.\r\n\r\nSecond. You will not in any case detain the crew of a captured neutral\r\nvessel or any other subject of a neutral power on board such vessel,\r\nas prisoners of war or otherwise, except the small number necessary as\r\nwitnesses in the prize court.\r\n\r\nNOTE.-The practice here forbidden is also charged to exist, which, if\r\ntrue, is disapproved and must cease.\r\n\r\nMy dear sir, it is not intended to be insinuated that you have been\r\nremiss in the performance of the arduous and responsible duties of your\r\ndepartment, which, I take pleasure in affirming, has in your hands been\r\nconducted with admirable success. Yet, while your subordinates are almost\r\nof necessity brought into angry collision with the subjects of foreign\r\nstates, the representatives of those states and yourself do not come into\r\nimmediate contact for the purpose of keeping the peace, in spite of such\r\ncollisions. At that point there is an ultimate and heavy responsibility\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is in strict accordance with international law, and is\r\ntherefore unobjectionable; whilst, if it does no other good, it will\r\ncontribute to sustain a considerable portion of the present British\r\nministry in their places, who, if displaced, are sure to be replaced by\r\nothers more unfavorable to us.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO GOVERNOR PARKER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJuly 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR JOEL PARKER.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Yours of the 21st is received, and I have taken time and considered\r\nand discussed the subject with the Secretary of War and Provost-Marshal\r\nGeneral, in order, if possible, to make you a more favorable answer than I\r\nfinally find myself able to do.\r\n\r\nIt is a vital point with us to not have a special stipulation with the\r\ngovernor of any one State, because it would breed trouble in many, if not\r\nall, other States; and my idea was when I wrote you, as it still is, to\r\nget a point of time to which we could wait, on the reason that we were not\r\nready ourselves to proceed, and which might enable you to raise the quota\r\nof your State, in whole, or in large part, without the draft. The points\r\nof time you fix are much farther off than I had hoped. We might have got\r\nalong in the way I have indicated for twenty, or possibly thirty, days. As\r\nit stands, the best I can say is that every volunteer you will present us\r\nwithin thirty days from this date, fit and ready to be mustered into the\r\nUnited States service, on the usual terms, shall be pro tanto an abatement\r\nof your quota of the draft. That quota I can now state at eight thousand\r\nseven hundred and eighty-three (8783). No draft from New Jersey, other\r\nthan for the above quota, will be made before an additional draft, common\r\nto [all] the States, shall be required; and I may add that if we get well\r\nthrough with this draft, I entertain a strong hope that any further\r\none may never be needed. This expression of hope, however, must not be\r\nconstrued into a promise.\r\n\r\nAs to conducting the draft by townships, I find it would require such a\r\nwaste of labor already done, and such an additional amount of it, and such\r\na loss of time, as to make it, I fear, inadmissible.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--Since writing the above, getting additional information, I\r\nam enabled to say that the draft may be made in subdistricts, as the\r\nenrolment has been made, or is in process of making. This will amount\r\npractically to drafting by townships, as the enrollment subdistricts are\r\ngenerally about the extent of townships. A.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo GENERAL G. G. MEADE. (Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE:\r\n\r\nI have not thrown General Hooker away; and therefore I would like to know\r\nwhether it would be agreeable to you, all things considered, for him to\r\ntake a corps under you, if he himself is willing to do so. Write me in\r\nperfect freedom, with the assurance that I will not subject you to any\r\nembarrassment by making your letter or its contents known to any one. I\r\nwish to know your wishes before I decide whether to break the subject\r\nto him. Do not lean a hair's breadth against your own feelings, or your\r\njudgment of the public service, on the idea of gratifying me.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. B. BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, July 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, O.:\r\n\r\nLet me explain. In General Grant's first despatch after the fall of\r\nVicksburg, he said, among other things, he would send the Ninth Corps to\r\nyou. Thinking it would be pleasant to you, I asked the Secretary of War to\r\ntelegraph you the news. For some reasons never mentioned to us by General\r\nGrant, they have not been sent, though we have seen outside intimations\r\nthat they took part in the expedition against Jackson. General Grant is\r\na copious worker and fighter, but a very meager writer or telegrapher.\r\nNo doubt he changed his purpose in regard to the Ninth Corps for some\r\nsufficient reason, but has forgotten to notify us of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, July 29, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nSeeing General Meade's despatch of yesterday to yourself causes me to fear\r\nthat he supposes the Government here is demanding of him to bring on a\r\ngeneral engagement with Lee as soon as possible. I am claiming no such\r\nthing of him. In fact, my judgment is against it; which judgment, of\r\ncourse, I will yield if yours and his are the contrary. If he could not\r\nsafely engage Lee at Williamsport, it seems absurd to suppose he can\r\nsafely engage him now, when he has scarcely more than two thirds of\r\nthe force he had at Williamsport, while it must be that Lee has been\r\nreinforced. True, I desired General Meade to pursue Lee across the\r\nPotomac, hoping, as has proved true, that he would thereby clear the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, and get some advantages by harassing him on\r\nhis retreat. These being past, I am unwilling he should now get into a\r\ngeneral engagement on the impression that we here are pressing him, and\r\nI shall be glad for you to so inform him, unless your own judgment is\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 29, 1863\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Can we not renew the effort to organize a force to go to western\r\nTexas?\r\n\r\nPlease consult with the general-in-chief on the subject.\r\n\r\nIf the Governor of New Jersey shall furnish any new regiments, might not\r\nthey be put into such an expedition? Please think of it.\r\n\r\nI believe no local object is now more desirable.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF RETALIATION.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every government to give protection to its citizens, of\r\nwhatever class, color, or condition, and especially to those who are duly\r\norganized as soldiers in the public service. The law of nations and the\r\nusages and customs of war, as carried on by civilized powers, permit no\r\ndistinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as public\r\nenemies. To sell or enslave any captured person, on account of his color\r\nand for no offense against the laws of war, is a relapse into barbarism,\r\nand a crime against the civilization of the age.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States will give the same protection to all\r\nits soldiers; and if the enemy shall sell or enslave any one because of\r\nhis color, the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy's\r\nprisoners in our possession.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore ordered that for every soldier of the United States killed\r\nin violation of the laws of war, a rebel soldier shall be executed; and\r\nfor every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier\r\nshall be placed at hard labor on the public works, and continued at such\r\nlabor until the other shall be released and receive the treatment due to a\r\nprisoner of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. A. HURLBUT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL HURLBUT:\r\n\r\nYour letter by Mr. Dana was duly received. I now learn that your\r\nresignation has reached the War Department. I also learn that an active\r\ncommand has been assigned you by General Grant. The Secretary of War and\r\nGeneral Halleck are very partial to you, as you know I also am. We all\r\nwish you to reconsider the question of resigning; not that we would\r\nwish to retain you greatly against your wish and interest, but that your\r\ndecision may be at least a very well-considered one.\r\n\r\nI understand that Senator [William K.] Sebastian, of Arkansas, thinks of\r\noffering to resume his place in the Senate. Of course the Senate, and not\r\nI, would decide whether to admit or reject him. Still I should feel great\r\ninterest in the question. It may be so presented as to be one of the very\r\ngreatest national importance; and it may be otherwise so presented as to\r\nbe of no more than temporary personal consequence to him.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation applies to Arkansas. I think it is valid\r\nin law, and will be so held by the courts. I think I shall not retract\r\nor repudiate it. Those who shall have tasted actual freedom I believe can\r\nnever be slaves or quasi-slaves again. For the rest, I believe some plan\r\nsubstantially being gradual emancipation would be better for both white\r\nand black. The Missouri plan recently adopted, I do not object to on\r\naccount of the time for ending the institution; but I am sorry the\r\nbeginning should have been postponed for seven years, leaving all that\r\ntime to agitate for the repeal of the whole thing. It should begin at\r\nonce, giving at least the new-born a vested interest in freedom which\r\ncould not be taken away. If Senator Sebastian could come with something\r\nof this sort from Arkansas, I, at least, should take great interest in his\r\ncase; and I believe a single individual will have scarcely done the world\r\nso great a service. See him if you can, and read this to him; but charge\r\nhim not to make it public for the present. Write me again.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nALBANY, August 1, 1863. Recvd 2 P.M.\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nI ask that the draft be suspended in this State until I can send you a\r\ncommunication I am preparing.\r\n\r\nHORATIO SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., August 1, 1863. 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR SEYMOUR, Albany, N.Y.:\r\n\r\nBy what day may I expect your communication to reach me? Are you anxious\r\nabout any part except the city and vicinity?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL FOSTER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FOSTER (or whoever may be in command of the military\r\ndepartment with headquarters at Fort Monroe, Va.):\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Wright, on trial at Norfolk, has been or shall be convicted, send\r\nme a transcript of his trial and conviction, and do not let execution be\r\ndone upon him until my further order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 5,1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL BANKS:\r\n\r\nWhile I very well know what I would be glad for Louisiana to do, it is\r\nquite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter. I would\r\nbe glad for her to make a new constitution, recognizing the emancipation\r\nproclamation, and adopting emancipation in those parts of the State to\r\nwhich the proclamation does not apply. And while she is at it, I think it\r\nwould not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which\r\nthe two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to\r\neach other, and both come out better prepared for the new. Education\r\nfor young blacks should be included in the plan. After all, the power or\r\nelement of \"contract\" may be sufficient for this probationary period, and\r\nby its simplicity and flexibility may be the better.\r\n\r\nAs an antislavery man, I have a motive to desire emancipation which\r\nproslavery men do not have but even they have strong enough reason to\r\nthus place themselves again under the shield of the Union, and to thus\r\nperpetually hedge against the recurrence of the scenes through which we\r\nare now passing.\r\n\r\nGovernor Shepley has informed me that Mr. Durant is now taking a registry,\r\nwith a view to the election of a constitutional convention in Louisiana.\r\nThis, to me, appears proper. If such convention were to ask my views, I\r\ncould present little else than what I now say to you. I think the thing\r\nshould be pushed forward, so that, if possible, its mature work may reach\r\nhere by the meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I think I shall not, in any event, retract the\r\nemancipation proclamation: nor, as executive, ever return to slavery any\r\nperson who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the\r\nacts of Congress.\r\n\r\nIf Louisiana shall send members to Congress, their admission to seats\r\nwill depend, as you know, upon the respective Houses, and not upon the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR, Governor of New York:\r\n\r\nYour communication of the 3rd instant has been received and attentively\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nI cannot consent to suspend the draft in New York, as you request,\r\nbecause, among other reasons, time is too important.\r\n\r\nBy the figures you send, which I presume are correct, the twelve districts\r\nrepresented fall into two classes of eight and four respectively. The\r\ndisparity of the quotas for the draft in these two classes is certainly\r\nvery striking, being the difference between an average of 2200 in one\r\nclass and 4864 in the other. Assuming that the districts are equal one to\r\nanother in entire population, as required by the plan on which they were\r\nmade, this disparity is such as to require attention. Much of it, however,\r\nI suppose will be accounted for by the fact that so many more persons fit\r\nfor soldiers are in the city than are in the country who have too recently\r\narrived from other parts of the United States and from Europe to be either\r\nincluded in the census of 1860, or to have voted in 1862. Still, making\r\ndue allowance for this, I am yet unwilling to stand upon it as an entirely\r\nsufficient explanation of the great disparity.\r\n\r\nI shall direct the draft to proceed in all the districts, drawing,\r\nhowever, at first from each of the four districts--to wit, the Second,\r\nFourth, Sixth, and Eighth--only, 2200 being the average quota of the other\r\nclass. After this drawing, these four districts, and also the Seventeenth\r\nand Twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled; and, if you please,\r\nagents of yours may witness every step of the process. Any deficiency\r\nwhich may appear by the new enrolment will be supplied by a special draft\r\nfor that object, allowing due credit for volunteers who may be obtained\r\nfrom these districts respectively during the interval; and at all points,\r\nso far as consistent with practical convenience, due credits shall be\r\ngiven for volunteers, and your Excellency shall be notified of the time\r\nfixed for commencing the draft in each district.\r\n\r\nI do not object to abide a decision of the United States Supreme Court, or\r\nof the judges thereof, on the constitutionality of the draft law. In\r\nfact, I should be willing to facilitate the obtaining of it. But I cannot\r\nconsent to lose the time while it is being obtained. We are contending\r\nwith an enemy who, as I understand, drives every able-bodied man he can\r\nreach into his ranks, very much as a butcher drives bullocks into the\r\nslaughter-pen. No time is wasted, no argument is used. This produces an\r\narmy which will soon turn upon our now victorious soldiers already in the\r\nfield, if they shall not be sustained by recruits as they should be. It\r\nproduces an army with a rapidity not to be matched on our side if we first\r\nwaste time to re-experiment with the volunteer system, already deemed by\r\nCongress, and palpably, in fact, so far exhausted as to be inadequate;\r\nand then more time to obtain a court decision as to whether a law is\r\nconstitutional, which requires a part of those not now in the service\r\nto go to the aid of those who are already in it; and still more time to\r\ndetermine with absolute certainty that we get those who are to go in the\r\nprecisely legal proportion to those who are not to go. My purpose is to be\r\nin my action just and constitutional, and yet practical, in performing the\r\nimportant duty with which I am charged, of maintaining the unity and the\r\nfree principles of our common country.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, August 9, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nI see by a despatch of yours that you incline quite strongly toward an\r\nexpedition against Mobile. This would appear tempting to me also, were it\r\nnot that in view of recent events in Mexico I am greatly impressed with\r\nthe importance of re-establishing the national authority in western Texas\r\nas soon as possible. I am not making an order, however; that I leave, for\r\nthe present at least, to the general-in-chief.\r\n\r\nA word upon another subject: General Thomas has gone again to the\r\nMississippi Valley, with the view of raising colored troops. I have no\r\nreason to doubt that you are doing what you reasonably can upon the same\r\nsubject. I believe it is a resource which if vigorously applied now\r\nwill soon close the contest. It works doubly, weakening the enemy and\r\nstrengthening us. We were not fully ripe for it until the river was\r\nopened. Now, I think at least one hundred thousand can and ought to be\r\nrapidly organized along its shores, relieving all white troops to serve\r\nelsewhere. Mr. Dana understands you as believing that the Emancipation\r\nProclamation has helped some in your military operations. I am very glad\r\nif this is so.\r\n\r\nDid you receive a short letter from me dated the 13th of July?\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL ROSECRANS:\r\n\r\nYours of the 1st was received two days ago. I think you must have inferred\r\nmore than General Halleck has intended, as to any dissatisfaction of mine\r\nwith you. I am sure you, as a reasonable man, would not have been wounded\r\ncould you have heard all my words and seen all my thoughts in regard to\r\nyou. I have not abated in my kind feeling for and confidence in you. I\r\nhave seen most of your despatches to General Halleck--probably all of\r\nthem. After Grant invested Vicksburg I was very anxious lest Johnston\r\nshould overwhelm him from the outside, and when it appeared certain that\r\npart of Bragg's force had gone and was going to Johnston, it did seem to\r\nme it was exactly the proper time for you to attack Bragg with what force\r\nhe had left. In all kindness let me say it so seems to me yet. Finding\r\nfrom your despatches to General Halleck that your judgment was different,\r\nand being very anxious for Grant, I, on one occasion, told General Halleck\r\nI thought he should direct you to decide at once to immediately attack\r\nBragg or to stand on the defensive and send part of your force to Grant.\r\nHe replied he had already so directed in substance. Soon after, despatches\r\nfrom Grant abated my anxiety for him, and in proportion abated my anxiety\r\nabout any movement of yours. When afterward, however, I saw a despatch of\r\nyours arguing that the right time for you to attack Bragg was not before,\r\nbut would be after, the fall of Vicksburg, it impressed me very strangely,\r\nand I think I so stated to the Secretary of War and General Halleck. It\r\nseemed no other than the proposition that you could better fight Bragg\r\nwhen Johnston should be at liberty to return and assist him than you could\r\nbefore he could so return to his assistance.\r\n\r\nSince Grant has been entirely relieved by the fall of Vicksburg, by which\r\nJohnston is also relieved, it has seemed to me that your chance for a\r\nstroke has been considerably diminished, and I have not been pressing you\r\ndirectly or indirectly. True, I am very anxious for East Tennessee to be\r\noccupied by us; but I see and appreciate the difficulties you mention. The\r\nquestion occurs, Can the thing be done at all? Does preparation advance at\r\nall? Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward? Have you\r\nmore animals to-day than you had at the battle of Stone's River? And\r\nyet have not more been furnished you since then than your entire present\r\nstock? I ask the same questions as to your mounted force.\r\n\r\nDo not misunderstand: I am not casting blame upon you; I rather think\r\nby great exertion you can get to East Tennessee; but a very important\r\nquestion is, Can you stay there? I make no order in the case--that I leave\r\nto General Halleck and yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd now be assured once more that I think of you in all kindness and\r\nconfidence, and that I am not watching you with an evil eye.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, August 11.1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR, Governor of New York:\r\n\r\nYours of the 8th, with Judge-Advocate-General Waterbury's report, was\r\nreceived to-day.\r\n\r\nAsking you to remember that I consider time as being very important, both\r\nto the general cause of the country and to the soldiers in the field, I\r\nbeg to remind you that I waited, at your request, from the 1st until the\r\n6th inst., to receive your communication dated the 3d. In view of\r\nits great length, and the known time and apparent care taken in its\r\npreparation, I did not doubt that it contained your full case as you\r\ndesired to present it. It contained the figures for twelve districts,\r\nomitting the other nineteen, as I suppose, because you found nothing to\r\ncomplain of as to them. I answered accordingly. In doing so I laid down\r\nthe principle to which I purpose adhering, which is to proceed with the\r\ndraft, at the same time employing infallible means to avoid any great\r\nwrong. With the communication received to-day you send figures for\r\ntwenty-eight districts, including the twelve sent before, and still\r\nomitting three, for which I suppose the enrolments are not yet received.\r\nIn looking over the fuller list of twenty-eight districts, I find that the\r\nquotas for sixteen of them are above 2000 and below 2700, while, of the\r\nrest, six are above 2700 and six are below 2000. Applying the principle to\r\nthese new facts, the Fifth and Seventh districts must be added to the four\r\nin which the quotas have already been reduced to 2200 for the first draft;\r\nand with these four others just be added to those to be re-enrolled. The\r\ncorrect case will then stand: the quotas of the Second, Fourth, Fifth,\r\nSixth, Seventh, and Eighth districts fixed at 2200 for the first draft.\r\nThe Provost-Marshal-General informs me that the drawing is already\r\ncompleted in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Twenty-second,\r\nTwenty-fourth, Twenty-sixth, Twenty-seventh, Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth,\r\nand Thirtieth districts. In the others, except the three outstanding, the\r\ndrawing will be made upon the quotas as now fixed. After the first draft,\r\nthe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth,\r\nTwenty-first, Twenty-fifth, Twenty-ninth, and Thirty-first will be\r\nenrolled for the purpose and in the manner stated in my letter of the 7th\r\ninst. The same principle will be applied to the now outstanding districts\r\nwhen they shall come in. No part of my former letter is repudiated by\r\nreason of not being restated in this, or for any other cause.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. A. McCLERNAND.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLERNAND.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Our friend William G. Greene has just presented a kind\r\nletter in regard to yourself, addressed to me by our other friends Yates,\r\nHatch, and Dubois.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether your present position is more painful to you than to\r\nmyself. Grateful for the patriotic stand so early taken by you in this\r\nlife-and-death struggle of the nation, I have done whatever has appeared\r\npracticable to advance you and the public interest together. No charges,\r\nwith a view to a trial, have been preferred against you by any one; nor do\r\nI suppose any will be. All there is, so far as I have heard, is General\r\nGrant's statement of his reasons for relieving you. And even this I have\r\nnot seen or sought to see; because it is a case, as appears to me, in\r\nwhich I could do nothing without doing harm. General Grant and yourself\r\nhave been conspicuous in our most important successes; and for me to\r\ninterfere and thus magnify a breach between you could not but be of evil\r\neffect. Better leave it where the law of the case has placed it. For me to\r\nforce you back upon General Grant would be forcing him to resign. I cannot\r\ngive you a new command, because we have no forces except such as already\r\nhave commanders.\r\n\r\nI am constantly pressed by those who scold before they think, or without\r\nthinking at all, to give commands respectively to Fremont, McClellan,\r\nButler, Sigel, Curtis, Hunter, Hooker, and perhaps others, when, all else\r\nout of the way, I have no commands to give them. This is now your case;\r\nwhich, as I have said, pains me not less than it does you. My belief is\r\nthat the permanent estimate of what a general does in the field is fixed\r\nby the \"cloud of witnesses\" who have been with him in the field, and that,\r\nrelying on these, he who has the right needs not to fear.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, AUGUST 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR SEYMOUR, New York:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of this morning is just received, and I fear I do not\r\nperfectly understand it.\r\n\r\nMy view of the principle is that every soldier obtained voluntarily leaves\r\none less to be obtained by draft. The only difficulty is in applying the\r\nprinciple properly. Looking to time, as heretofore, I am unwilling to\r\ngive up a drafted man now, even for the certainty, much less for the mere\r\nchance, of getting a volunteer hereafter. Again, after the draft in any\r\ndistrict, would it not make trouble to take any drafted man out and put a\r\nvolunteer in--for how shall it be determined which drafted man is to have\r\nthe privilege of thus going out, to the exclusion of all the others? And\r\neven before the draft in any district the quota must be fixed; and the\r\ndraft must be postponed indefinitely if every time a volunteer is offered\r\nthe officers must stop and reconstruct the quota. At least I fear there\r\nmight be this difficulty; but, at all events, let credits for volunteers\r\nbe given up to the last moment which will not produce confusion or delay.\r\nThat the principle of giving credits for volunteers shall be applied by\r\ndistricts seems fair and proper, though I do not know how far by present\r\nstatistics it is practicable. When for any cause a fair credit is not\r\ngiven at one time, it should be given as soon thereafter as practicable.\r\nMy purpose is to be just and fair, and yet to not lose time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo J. H. HACKETT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON August 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nJAMES H. HACKETT, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Months ago I should have acknowledged the receipt of your\r\nbook and accompanying kind note; and I now have to beg your pardon for not\r\nhaving done so.\r\n\r\nFor one of my age I have seen very little of the drama. The first\r\npresentation of Falstaff I ever saw was yours here, last winter or spring.\r\nPerhaps the best compliment I can pay is to say, as I truly can, I am very\r\nanxious to see it again. Some of Shakespeare's plays I have never read,\r\nwhile others I have gone over perhaps as frequently as any un-professional\r\nreader. Among the latter are Lear, Richard III., Henry VIII., Hamlet, and\r\nespecially Macbeth. I think nothing equals Macbeth. It is wonderful.\r\n\r\nUnlike you gentlemen of the profession, I think the soliloquy in Hamlet\r\ncommencing \"Oh, my offense is rank,\" surpasses that commencing \"To be or\r\nnot to be.\" But pardon this small attempt at criticism. I should like to\r\nhear you pronounce the opening speech of Richard III. Will you not soon\r\nvisit Washington again? If you do, please call and let me make your\r\npersonal acquaintance.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO F. F. LOWE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. P. F. LOWE, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nThere seems to be considerable misunderstanding about the recent movement\r\nto take possession of the \"New Almaden\" mine. It has no reference to any\r\nother mine or mines.\r\n\r\nIn regard to mines and miners generally, no change of policy by the\r\nGovernment has been decided on, or even thought of, so far as I know.\r\n\r\nThe \"New Almaden\" mine was peculiar in this: that its occupants claimed to\r\nbe the legal owners of it on a Mexican grant, and went into court on that\r\nclaim. The case found its way into the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nand last term, in and by that court, the claim of the occupants was\r\ndecided to be utterly fraudulent. Thereupon it was considered the duty of\r\nthe Government by the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney-General,\r\nand myself to take possession of the premises; and the Attorney-General\r\ncarefully made out the writ and I signed it. It was not obtained\r\nsurreptitiously, although I suppose General Halleck thought it had been,\r\nwhen he telegraphed, simply because he thought possession was about being\r\ntaken by a military order, while he knew no such order had passed through\r\nhis hands as general-in-chief.\r\n\r\nThe writ was suspended, upon urgent representations from California,\r\nsimply to keep the peace. It never had any direct or indirect reference to\r\nany mine, place, or person, except the \"New Almaden\" mine and the persons\r\nconnected with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Warrenton, Va.:\r\n\r\nAt this late moment I am appealed to in behalf of William Thompson of\r\nCompany K, Third Maryland Volunteers, in Twelfth Army Corps, said to be\r\nat Kelly's Ford, under sentence to be shot to-day as a deserter. He is\r\nrepresented to me to be very young, with symptoms of insanity. Please\r\npostpone the execution till further order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

I telegraphed\r\nGeneral Strong for it, but he does not answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. GRIMSLEY.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CRITICS OF EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nTo J. C. CONKLING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES C. CONKLING.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of\r\nunconditional Union men, to be held at the capital of Illinois, on the\r\n3d day of September, has been received. It would be very agreeable for\r\nme thus to meet my old friends at my own home, but I cannot just now be\r\nabsent from here so long as a visit there would require.\r\n\r\nThe meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to\r\nthe Union, and I am sure that my old political friends will thank me for\r\ntendering, as I do, the nation's gratitude to those other noble men whom\r\nno partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nation's life.\r\n\r\nThere are those who are dissatisfied with me. To such I would say: You\r\ndesire peace, and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we\r\nobtain it? There are but three conceivable ways:\r\n\r\nFirst--to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This I am trying to do.\r\nAre you for it? If you are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a\r\nsecond way is to give up the Union. I am against this. Are you for it? If\r\nyou are you should say so plainly. If you are not for force nor yet for\r\ndissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that any compromise embracing the maintenance of the\r\nUnion is now possible. All that I learn leads to a directly opposite\r\nbelief. The strength of the rebellion is its military, its army. That army\r\ndominates all the country and all the people within its range. Any offer\r\nof terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that\r\narmy, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men have no\r\npower whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South and peace men of the North\r\nget together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing\r\na restoration of the Union. In what way can that compromise be used to\r\nkeep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania? Meade's army can keep Lee's army out\r\nof Pennsylvania, and, I think, can ultimately drive it out of existence.\r\nBut no paper compromise to which the controllers of Lee's army are not\r\nagreed can at all affect that army. In an effort at such compromise we\r\nwould waste time, which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and\r\nthat would be all.\r\n\r\nA compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who control\r\nthe rebel army, or with the people, first liberated from the domination of\r\nthat army by the success of our own army. Now allow me to assure you\r\nthat no word or intimation from that rebel army, or from any of the men\r\ncontrolling it, in relation to any peace compromise, has ever come to\r\nmy knowledge or belief. All charges and insinuations to the contrary are\r\ndeceptive and groundless. And I promise you that if any such proposition\r\nshall hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you.\r\nI freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the people, according to\r\nthe bond of service, the United States Constitution, and that, as such, I\r\nam responsible to them.\r\n\r\nBut, to be plain: You are dissatisfied with me about the negro. Quite\r\nlikely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon\r\nthat subject. I certainly wish that all men could be free, while you,\r\nI suppose, do not. Yet, I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure\r\nwhich is not consistent with even your view, provided you are for the\r\nUnion. I suggested compensated emancipation; to which you replied you\r\nwished not to be taxed to buy negroes. But I had not asked you to be taxed\r\nto buy negroes, except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to\r\nsave the Union exclusively by other means.\r\n\r\nYou dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps would have it\r\nretracted. You say it is unconstitutional. I think differently. I think\r\nthe Constitution invests its commander-in-chief with the law of war in\r\ntime of war. The most that can be said, if so much, is, that slaves are\r\nproperty. Is there, has there ever been, any question that by the law of\r\nwar, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed? And\r\nis it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy? Armies, the\r\nworld over, destroy enemies' property when they cannot use it, and even\r\ndestroy their own to keep it from the enemy. Civilized belligerents do all\r\nin their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy, except a few things\r\nregarded as barbarous or cruel. Among the exceptions are the massacre of\r\nvanquished foes and non-combatants, male and female.\r\n\r\nBut the proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid. If it is\r\nnot valid it needs no retraction. If it is valid it cannot be retracted,\r\nany more than the dead can be brought to life. Some of you profess to\r\nthink its retraction would operate favorably for the Union, why better\r\nafter the retraction than before the issue? There was more than a year\r\nand a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation was\r\nissued, the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice\r\nthat it was coming, unless averted by those in revolt returning to their\r\nallegiance. The war has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the\r\nissue of the proclamation as before.\r\n\r\nI know, as fully as one can know the opinions of others, that some of\r\nthe commanders of our armies in the field, who have given us our most\r\nimportant victories, believe the emancipation policy and the use of\r\ncolored troops constitute the heaviest blows yet dealt to the rebellion,\r\nand that at least one of those important successes could not have been\r\nachieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers.\r\n\r\nAmong the commanders who hold these views are some who have never had any\r\naffinity with what is called \"Abolitionism,\" or with \"Republican Party\r\npolitics,\" but who hold them purely as military opinions. I submit their\r\nopinions are entitled to some weight against the objections often urged\r\nthat emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures,\r\nand were not adopted as such in good faith.\r\n\r\nYou say that you will not fight to free negroes. Some of them seem willing\r\nto fight for you; but no matter. Fight you, then, exclusively, to save\r\nthe Union. I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the\r\nUnion. Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if\r\nI shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for\r\nyou to declare you will not fight to free negroes. I thought that in\r\nyour struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the negroes should cease\r\nhelping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance\r\nto you. Do you think differently? I thought that whatever negroes can be\r\ngot to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do\r\nin saving the Union. Does it appear otherwise to you? But negroes, like\r\nother people, act upon motives. Why should they do anything for us if we\r\nwill do nothing for them? If they stake their lives for us they must be\r\nprompted by the strongest motive, even the promise of freedom. And the\r\npromise, being made, must be kept.\r\n\r\nThe signs look better. The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the\r\nsea. Thanks to the great Northwest for it; nor yet wholly to them. Three\r\nhundred miles up they met New England, Empire, Keystone, and Jersey,\r\nhewing their way right and left. The sunny South, too, in more colors than\r\none, also lent a helping hand. On the spot, their part of the history was\r\njotted down in black and white. The job was a great national one, and let\r\nnone be slighted who bore an honorable part in it And while those who have\r\ncleared the great river may well be proud, even that is not all. It is\r\nhard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at\r\nAntietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of less note. Nor\r\nmust Uncle Sam's web-feet be forgotten. At all the watery margins they\r\nhave been present; not only on the deep sea, the broad bay, and the rapid\r\nriver, but also up the narrow, muddy bayou, and wherever the ground was a\r\nlittle damp, they have been and made their tracks. Thanks to all. For the\r\ngreat Republic--for the principle it lives by and keeps alive--for man's\r\nvast future--thanks to all.\r\n\r\nPeace does not appear so distant as it did. I hope it will come soon, and\r\ncome to stay, and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future\r\ntime. It will then have been proved that among freemen there can be no\r\nsuccessful appeal from the ballot to the bullet, and that they who take\r\nsuch appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost. And there will\r\nbe some black men who can remember that with silent tongue, and clinched\r\nteeth, and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind\r\non to this great consummation; while I fear there will be some white ones\r\nunable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they have\r\nstriven to hinder it.\r\n\r\nStill, let us not be over-sanguine of a speedy, final triumph. Let us be\r\nquite sober. Let us diligently apply the means, never doubting that a just\r\nGod, in His own good time, will give us the rightful result.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES CONKLING.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., August 27.1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES CONKLING.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CONKLING:--I cannot leave here now. Herewith is a letter instead.\r\nYou are one of the best public readers. I have but one suggestion--read it\r\nvery slowly. And now God bless you, and all good Union men.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR SIR:-In my correspondence with Governor Seymour in\r\nrelation to the draft, I have said to him, substantially, that credits\r\nshall be given for volunteers up to the latest moment, before drawing in\r\nany district, that can be done without producing confusion or delay. In\r\norder to do this, let our mustering officers in New York and elsewhere be\r\nat, once instructed that whenever they muster into our service any number\r\nof volunteers, to at once make return to the War Department, both by\r\ntelegraph and mail, the date of the muster, the number mustered, and the\r\nCongressional or enrolment district or districts, of their residences,\r\ngiving the numbers separately for each district. Keep these returns\r\ndiligently posted, and by them give full credit on the quotas, if\r\npossible, on the last day before the draft begins in any district.\r\n\r\nAgain, I have informed Governor Seymour that he shall be notified of the\r\ntime when the draft is to commence in each district in his State. This\r\nis equally proper for all the States. In order to carry it out, I propose\r\nthat so soon as the day for commencing the draft in any district is\r\ndefinitely determined, the governor of the State, including the district,\r\nbe notified thereof, both by telegraph and mail, in form about as follows:\r\n\r\n     ------------------------------\r\n\r\n     ------------------------ 1863.\r\n\r\nGovernor of ------------------------------\r\n     ------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are notified that the draft will commence in the\r\n------------------ ---- district, at ------ on the\r\n ------ day ------------\r\n1863, at ------ A.M. of said day.\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this by telegraph and mail.\r\n               ------------------------\r\n               ------------------------\r\n\r\nThis notice may be given by the Provost-Marshal-General here, the\r\nsub-provost-marshal-generals in the States, or perhaps by the district\r\nprovost-marshals.\r\n\r\nWhenever we shall have so far proceeded in New York as to make the\r\nre-enrolment specially promised there practicable, I wish that also to go\r\nforward, and I wish Governor Seymour notified of it; so that if he choose,\r\nhe can place agents of his with ours to see the work fairly done.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 27. 1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR,\r\n\r\nGovernor of New York:\r\n\r\nYours of the 21st, with exhibits, was received on the 24th.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of pressing duties I have been unable to answer it sooner. In\r\nthe meantime the Provost Marshal-General has had access to yours, and has\r\naddressed a communication in relation to it to the Secretary of War, a\r\ncopy of which communication I herewith enclose to you.\r\n\r\nIndependently of this, I addressed a letter on the same subject to the\r\nSecretary of War, a copy of which I also enclose to you. The Secretary\r\nhas sent my letter to the Provost-Marshal General, with direction that\r\nhe adopt and follow the course therein pointed out. It will, of course,\r\noverrule any conflicting view of the Provost-Marshal-General, if there be\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.-I do not mean to say that if the Provost-Marshal-General can find\r\nit practicable to give credits by subdistricts, I overrule him in that.\r\nOn the contrary, I shall be glad of it; but I will not take the risk of\r\nover-burdening him by ordering him to do it.

M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SCHOFIELD, St. LOUIS:\r\n\r\nI have just received the despatch which follows, from two very influential\r\ncitizens of Kansas, whose names I omit.

I understand these are very flagrant\r\ncases, and that you deem their punishment as being indispensable to the\r\nservice. If I am not mistaken in this, please let them know at once that\r\ntheir appeal is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO F. C. SHERMAN AND J. S.

It seems to me\r\nthe Government here will be overwhelmed if it undertakes to conduct\r\nthese matters with the authorities of cities and counties. They must be\r\nconducted with the governors of States, who will, of course, represent\r\ntheir cities and counties. Meanwhile you need not be uneasy until you\r\nagain hear from here.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Fort Sumter is certainly battered down and utterly useless\r\nto the enemy, and it is believed here, but not entirely certain, that both\r\nSumter and Fort Wagner are occupied by our forces. It is also certain that\r\nGeneral Gilmore has thrown some shot into the city of Charleston.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. C. CONKLING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES C. CONKLING, Springfield, Ill.:\r\n\r\nIn my letter of the 26th insert between the sentence ending \"since the\r\nissue of the Emancipation Proclamation as before\" and the next, commencing\r\n\"You say you will not fight, etc.,\" what follows below my signature\r\nhereto.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\"I know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of\r\nthe commanders of our armies in the field, who have given us our most\r\nimportant successes, believe the emancipation policy and the use of\r\ncolored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion,\r\nand that at least one of those important successes could not have been\r\nachieved when it was, but for the aid of black soldiers. Among the\r\ncommanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity\r\nwith what is called abolitionism, or with Republican party politics, but\r\nwho hold them purely as military opinions. I submit these opinions as\r\nbeing entitled to some weight against the objections, often urged, that\r\nemancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and\r\nwere not adopted as such in good faith.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL ROSECRANS:\r\n\r\nYours of the 22d was received yesterday. When I wrote you before, I did\r\nnot intend, nor do I now, to engage in an argument with you on military\r\nquestions. You had informed me you were impressed through General Halleck\r\nthat I was dissatisfied with you, and I could not bluntly deny that I was\r\nwithout unjustly implicating him. I therefore concluded to tell you the\r\nplain truth, being satisfied the matter would thus appear much smaller\r\nthan it would if seen by mere glimpses. I repeat that my appreciation of\r\nyou has not abated. I can never forget whilst I remember anything, that\r\nabout the end of last year and the beginning of this, you gave us a\r\nhard-earned victory, which, had there been a defeat instead, the nation\r\ncould hardly have lived over. Neither can I forget the check you so\r\nopportunely gave to a dangerous sentiment which was spreading in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nYours, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 1863\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that retaliation for the recent great outrage\r\nat Lawrence, in Kansas, may extend to indiscriminate slaughter on the\r\nMissouri border, unless averted by very judicious action. I shall be\r\nobliged if the general-in-chief can make any suggestions to General\r\nSchofield upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL MOTIVATED MISQUOTATION IN NEWSPAPER\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. C. CONKLING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES C. CONKLING, Springfield, Ill.:\r\n\r\nI am mortified this morning to find the letter to you botched up in the\r\nEastern papers, telegraphed from Chicago. How did this happen?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING COMMERCIAL REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That the executive order dated November 21, 1862, prohibiting the\r\nexportation from the United States of arms, ammunition, or munitions of\r\nwar, under which the commandants of departments were, by order of the\r\nSecretary of War dated May 13, 1863, directed to prohibit the purchase\r\nand sale, for exportation from the United States, of all horses and mules\r\nwithin their respective commands, and to take and appropriate for the\r\nuse of the United States any horses, mules, and live stock designed for\r\nexportation, be so far modified that any arms heretofore imported into the\r\nUnited States may be re-exported to the place of original shipment,\r\nand that any live stock raised in any State or Territory bounded by the\r\nPacific Ocean may be exported from, any port of such State or Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. SEGAR.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C.. September 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JOSEPH SEGAR, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nI have just seen your despatch to the Secretary of War, who is absent.\r\nI also send a despatch from Major Hayner of the 3d showing that he had\r\nnotice of my order, and stating that the people were jubilant over it, as\r\na victory over the Government extorted by fear, and that he had already\r\ncollected about $4000 of the money. If he has proceeded since, I shall\r\nhold him accountable for his contumacy. On the contrary, no dollar shall\r\nbe refunded by my order until it shall appear that my act in the case has\r\nbeen accepted in the right spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON. D. C. September 6, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN, Manchester, Vt.:\r\n\r\nAll well and no news except that General Burnside has Knoxville, Ten.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, September 6, 1863. 6 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Bedford, Pa.:\r\n\r\nBurnside has Kingston and Knoxville, and drove the enemy across the river\r\nat Loudon, the enemy destroying the bridge there; captured some stores and\r\none or two trains; very little fighting; few wounded and none killed. No\r\nother news of consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO F. C. SHERMAN AND J. S. HAYES.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, September 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nYours of August 29 just received. I suppose it was intended by Congress\r\nthat this government should execute the act in question without dependence\r\nupon any other government, State, city, or county. It is, however, within\r\nthe range of practical convenience to confer with the governments of\r\nStates, while it is quite beyond that range to have correspondence on the\r\nsubject with counties and cities. They are too numerous. As instances, I\r\nhave corresponded with Governor Seymour, but Not with Mayor Opdyke; with\r\nGovernor Curtin, but not with Mayor Henry.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 8, 1863. 9.30\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nDespatch of yesterday just received. I shall try to find the paper you\r\nmention and carefully consider it. In the meantime let me urge that you do\r\nyour utmost to get every man you can, black and white, under arms at the\r\nvery earliest moment, to guard roads, bridges, and trains, allowing all\r\nthe better trained soldiers to go forward to Rosecrans. Of course I mean\r\nfor you to act in co-operation with and not independently of, the military\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 9, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Warrenton, Va.:\r\n\r\nIt would be a generous thing to give General Wheaton a leave of absence\r\nfor ten or fifteen days, and if you can do so without injury to the\r\nservice, please do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL WHEATON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL WHEATON, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nYesterday at the instance of Mr. Blair, senator, I telegraphed General\r\nMeade asking him to grant you a leave of absence, to which he replied that\r\nyou had not applied for such leave, and that you can have it when you do\r\napply. I suppose it is proper for you to know this.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER, 11, 1863\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--All Tennessee is now clear of armed insurrectionists. You\r\nneed not to be reminded that it is the nick of time for reinaugurating\r\na loyal State government. Not a moment should be lost. You and the\r\nco-operating friends there can better judge of the ways and means than can\r\nbe judged by any here. I only offer a few suggestions. The reinauguration\r\nmust not be such as to give control of the State and its representation\r\nin Congress to the enemies of the Union, driving its friends there\r\ninto political exile. The whole struggle for Tennessee will have been\r\nprofitless to both State and nation if it so ends that Governor Johnson is\r\nput down and Governor Harris put up. It must not be so. You must have it\r\notherwise. Let the reconstruction be the work of such men only as can be\r\ntrusted for the Union. Exclude all others, and trust that your government\r\nso organized will be recognized here as being the one of republican form\r\nto be guaranteed to the State, and to be protected against invasion and\r\ndomestic violence. It is something on the question of time to remember\r\nthat it cannot be known who is next to occupy the position I now hold, nor\r\nwhat he will do. I see that you have declared in favor of emancipation\r\nin Tennessee, for which may God bless you. Get emancipation into your new\r\nState government constitution and there will be no such word as fail for\r\nyour cause. The raising of colored troops, I think, will greatly help\r\nevery way.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, September 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Cumberland Gap:\r\n\r\nYours received. A thousand thanks for the late successes you have given\r\nus. We cannot allow you to resign until things shall be a little more\r\nsettled in East Tennessee. If then, purely on your own account, you wish\r\nto resign, we will not further refuse you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Warrenton, Va.:\r\n\r\nIt is represented to me that Thomas Edds, in your army, is under sentence\r\nof death for desertion, to be executed next Monday. It is also said his\r\nsupposed desertion is comprised in an absence commencing with his falling\r\nbehind last winter, being captured and paroled by the enemy, and then\r\ngoing home. If this be near the truth, please suspend the execution till\r\nfurther order and send in the record of the trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEAD, Warrenton, Va.:\r\n\r\nThe name is \"Thomas Edds\" not \"Eddies\" as in your despatch. The papers\r\nleft with me do not designate the regiment to which he belongs. The man\r\nwho gave me the papers, I do not know how to find again. He only told me\r\nthat Edds is in the Army of the Potomac, and that he fell out of the ranks\r\nduring Burnside's mud march last winter. If I get further information I\r\nwill telegraph again.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO H. H. SCOTT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nDr. WILLIAM H. H. SCOTT, Danville, Ill.:\r\n\r\nYour niece, Mrs. Kate Sharp, can now have no difficulty in going to\r\nKnoxville, Tenn., as that place is within our military lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. G. BLAINE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nJ. G.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION SUSPENDING WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS, SEPTEMBER 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Constitution of the United States has ordained that the\r\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when,\r\nin cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it; and:\r\n\r\nWhereas a rebellion was existing on the third day of March, 1863, which\r\nrebellion is still existing; and:\r\n\r\nWhereas by a statute which was approved on that day it was enacted by\r\nthe Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress\r\nassembled that during the present insurrection the President of the\r\nUnited States, whenever in his judgment the public safety may require, is\r\nauthorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any\r\ncase throughout the United States or any part thereof; and:\r\n\r\nWhereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require\r\nthat the privilege of the said writ shall new be suspended throughout the\r\nUnited States in the cases where, by the authority of the President of the\r\nUnited States, military, naval, and civil officers of the United States,\r\nor any of them, hold persons under their command or in their custody,\r\neither as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy, or\r\nofficers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted\r\nin or belonging to the land or naval forces of the United States, or as\r\ndeserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law or the rules\r\nand articles of war or the rules or regulations prescribed for the\r\nmilitary or naval services by authority of the President of the United\r\nStates, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offense against the\r\nmilitary or naval service.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,\r\ndo hereby proclaim and make known to all whom it may concern that the\r\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus is suspended throughout the United\r\nStates in the several cases before mentioned, and that this suspension\r\nwill continue throughout the duration of the said rebellion or until this\r\nproclamation shall, by a subsequent one to be issued by the President of\r\nthe United States, be modified or revoked. And I do hereby require all\r\nmagistrates, attorneys, and other civil officers within the United States\r\nand all officers and others in the military and naval services of the\r\nUnited States to take distinct notice of this suspension and to give it\r\nfull effect, and all citizens of the United States to conduct and govern\r\nthemselves accordingly and in conformity with the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and the laws of Congress in such case made and provided.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed, this fifteenth day of September,\r\nA.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States of America the\r\neighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n  Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nIf I did not misunderstand General Meade's last despatch, he posts you\r\non facts as well as he can, and desires your views and those of the\r\nGovernment as to what he shall do. My opinion is that he should move upon\r\nLee at once in manner of general attack, leaving to developments whether\r\nhe will make it a real attack. I think this would develop Lee's real\r\ncondition and purposes better than the cavalry alone can do. Of course my\r\nopinion is not to control you and General Meade.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. SPEED.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nMRS. J. F. SPEED, Louisville, Ky.:\r\n\r\nMr. Holman will not be jostled from his place with my knowledge and\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I am appealed to in\r\nbehalf of Richard M. Abrams of Company A, Sixth New Jersey Volunteers, by\r\nGovernor Parker, Attorney-General Frelinghuysen, Governor Newell, Hon. Mr.\r\nMiddleton, M.

ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Herewith I send you a paper, substantially the same as the\r\none drawn up by yourself and mentioned in your despatch, but slightly\r\nchanged in two particulars: First, yours was so drawn as that I authorized\r\nyou to carry into effect the fourth section, etc., whereas I so modify\r\nit as to authorize you to so act as to require the United States to carry\r\ninto effect that section.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you had a clause committing me in some sort to the State\r\nconstitution of Tennessee, which I feared might embarrass you in making a\r\nnew constitution, if you desire; so I dropped that clause.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Inclosure.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\n\r\nSeptember 19, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON, Military Governor of Tennessee:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the matters contained in the orders and instructions given\r\nyou by the Secretary of War, you are hereby authorized to exercise such\r\npowers as may be necessary and proper to enable the loyal people of\r\nTennessee to present such a republican form of State government as will\r\nentitle the State to the guaranty of the United States therefor, and to\r\nbe protected under such State government by the United States against\r\ninvasion and domestic violence, all according to the fourth Section of the\r\nfourth article of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY STRATEGY\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON D.C. September 19, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nBy General Meade's despatch to you of yesterday it appears that he desires\r\nyour views and those of the government as to whether he shall advance upon\r\nthe enemy. I am not prepared to order, or even advise, an advance in this\r\ncase, wherein I know so little of particulars, and wherein he, in the\r\nfield, thinks the risk is so great and the promise of advantage so small.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the case presents matter for very serious consideration in\r\nanother aspect. These two armies confront each other across a small river,\r\nsubstantially midway between the two capitals, each defending its own\r\ncapital, and menacing the other. General Meade estimates the enemy's\r\ninfantry in front of him at not less than 40,000. Suppose we add fifty per\r\ncent. to this for cavalry, artillery, and extra-duty men stretching as far\r\nas Richmond, making the whole force of the enemy 60,000.\r\n\r\nGeneral Meade, as shown by the returns, has with him, and between him and\r\nWashington, of the same classes, of well men, over 90,000. Neither can\r\nbring the whole of his men into a battle; but each can bring as large a\r\npercentage in as the other. For a battle, then, General Meade has three\r\nmen to General Lee's two. Yet, it having been determined that choosing\r\nground and standing on the defensive gives so great advantage that the\r\nthree cannot safely attack the two, the three are left simply standing on\r\nthe defensive also.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy's 60,000 are sufficient to keep our 90,000 away from\r\nRichmond, why, by the same rule, may not 40,000 of ours keep their 60,000\r\naway from Washington, leaving us 50,000 to put to some other use? Having\r\npractically come to the mere defensive, it seems to be no economy at all\r\nto employ twice as many men for that object as are needed. With no object,\r\ncertainly, to mislead myself, I can perceive no fault in this statement,\r\nunless we admit we are not the equal of the enemy, man for man. I hope you\r\nwill consider it.\r\n\r\nTo avoid misunderstanding, let me say that to attempt to fight the enemy\r\nslowly back into his entrenchments at Richmond, and then to capture him,\r\nis an idea I have been trying to repudiate for quite a year.\r\n\r\nMy judgment is so clear against it that I would scarcely allow the attempt\r\nto be made if the general in command should desire to make it. My last\r\nattempt upon Richmond was to get McClellan, when he was nearer there\r\nthan the enemy was, to run in ahead of him. Since then I have constantly\r\ndesired the Army of the Potomac to make Lee's army, and not Richmond, its\r\nobjective point. If our army cannot fall upon the enemy and hurt him where\r\nhe is, it is plain to me it can gain nothing by attempting to follow him\r\nover a succession of intrenched lines into a fortified city.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN, New York:\r\n\r\nI neither see nor hear anything of sickness here now, though there may\r\nbe much without my knowing it. I wish you to stay or come just as is most\r\nagreeable to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C, September 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN. Fifth Avenue Hotel. New York:\r\n\r\nThe air is so clear and cool and apparently healthy that I would be glad\r\nfor you to come. Nothing very particular, but I would be glad to see you\r\nand Tad.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, D. C., September 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nI think it very important for General Rosecrans to hold his position at\r\nor about Chattanooga, because if held from that place to Cleveland, both\r\ninclusive, it keeps all Tennessee clear of the enemy, and also breaks one\r\nof his most important railroad lines. To prevent these consequences is so\r\nvital to his cause that he cannot give up the effort to dislodge us from\r\nthe position, thus bringing him to us and saving us the labor, expense,\r\nand hazard of going farther to find him, and also giving us the advantage\r\nof choosing our own ground and preparing it to fight him upon. The details\r\nmust, of course, be left to General Rosecrans, while we must furnish him\r\nthe means to the utmost of our ability. If you concur, I think he would\r\nbetter be informed that we are not pushing him beyond this position; and\r\nthat, in fact, our judgment is rather against his going beyond it. If he\r\ncan only maintain this position, without more, this rebellion can only eke\r\nout a short and feeble existence, as an animal sometimes may with a thorn\r\nin its vitals.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.C., September 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BURNSIDE, Greenville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nIf you are to do any good to Rosecrans it will not do to waste time with\r\nJonesboro.

LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, September 21, 1863. 12.55 PM.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Chattanooga:\r\n\r\nBe of good cheer. We have unabated confidence in you, and in your soldiers\r\nand officers. In the main you must be the judge as to what is to be\r\ndone. If I were to suggest, I would say, save your army by taking strong\r\npositions until Burnside joins you, when, I hope, you can turn the tide. I\r\nthink you had better send a courier to Burnside to hurry him up. We\r\ncannot reach him by telegraph. We suppose some force is going to you from\r\nCorinth, but for want of communication we do not know how they are\r\ngetting along. We shall do our utmost to assist you.

Your despatches to me of 9\r\nA.M., and to General Halleck of 2 P. M., yesterday, tell us nothing\r\nlater on those points.

The particular form of my despatch was\r\njocular, which I supposed you gentlemen knew me well enough to understand.\r\nGeneral Allen is considered here as a very faithful and capable officer,\r\nand one who would be at least thought of for quartermaster-general if that\r\noffice were vacant.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I\r\ndirected her to tell you to use your own pleasure whether to stay or come,\r\nand I did not say it is sickly and that you should on no account come.\r\nSo far as I see or know, it was never healthier, and I really wish to see\r\nyou.

You see he\r\ndoes not claim so many prisoners or captured guns as you were inclined\r\nto concede. He also confesses to heavy loss. An exchanged general of ours\r\nleaving Richmond yesterday says two of Longstreet's divisions and his\r\nentire artillery and two of Pickett's brigades and Wise's legion have gone\r\nto Tennessee. He mentions no other.\r\n\r\n\"CHICAMAUGA RIVER, SEPTEMBER 20.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL COOPER, Adjutant-General:\r\n\r\n\"After two days' hard fighting we have\r\ndriven the enemy, after a desperate resistance, from several positions,\r\nand now hold the field; but he still confronts us.

LINCOLN, Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York:\r\n\r\nWe now have a tolerably accurate summing up of the late battle between\r\nRosecrans and Braag. The result is that we are worsted, if at all, only\r\nin the fact that we, after the main fighting was over, yielded the ground,\r\nthus leaving considerable of our artillery and wounded to fall into the\r\nenemy's hands., for which we got nothing in turn. We lost in general\r\nofficers one killed and three or four wounded, all brigadiers, while,\r\naccording to the rebel accounts which we have, they lost six killed\r\nand eight wounded: of the killed one major-general and five brigadiers\r\nincluding your brother-in-law, Helm; and of the wounded three\r\nmajor-generals and five brigadiers. This list may be reduced two in number\r\nby corrections of confusion in names.

SCHOFIELD:\r\n\r\nThere is no organized military force in avowed opposition to the General\r\nGovernment now in Missouri, and if any shall reappear, your duty in regard\r\nto it will be too plain to require any special instruction. Still, the\r\ncondition of things, both there and elsewhere, is such as to render\r\nit indispensable to maintain, for a time, the United States military\r\nestablishment in that State, as well as to rely upon it for a fair\r\ncontribution of support to that establishment generally. Your immediate\r\nduty in regard to Missouri now is to advance the efficiency of that\r\nestablishment, and to so use it, as far as practicable, to compel the\r\nexcited people there to let one another alone.\r\n\r\nUnder your recent order, which I have approved, you will only arrest\r\nindividuals, and suppress assemblies or newspapers, when they may be\r\nworking palpable injury to the military in your charge; and in no other\r\ncase will you interfere with the expression of opinion in any form, or\r\nallow it to be interfered with violently by others. In this you have a\r\ndiscretion to exercise with great caution, calmness, and forbearance.\r\n\r\nWith the matter of removing the inhabitants of certain counties en masse,\r\nand of removing certain individuals from time to time, who are supposed\r\nto be mischievous, I am not now interfering, but am leaving to your own\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nNor am I interfering with what may still seem to you to be necessary\r\nrestrictions upon trade and intercourse. I think proper, however, to\r\nenjoin upon you the following: Allow no part of the military under your\r\ncommand to be engaged in either returning fugitive slaves or in forcing or\r\nenticing slaves from their homes; and, so far as practicable, enforce the\r\nsame forbearance upon the people.\r\n\r\nReport to me your opinion upon the availability for good of the enrolled\r\nmilitia of the State. Allow no one to enlist colored troops, except upon\r\norders from you, or from here through you.\r\n\r\nAllow no one to assume the functions of confiscating property, under the\r\nlaw of Congress, or otherwise, except upon orders from here.\r\n\r\nAt elections see that those, and only those, are allowed to vote who are\r\nentitled to do so by the laws of Missouri, including as of those laws\r\nthe restrictions laid by the Missouri convention upon those who may have\r\nparticipated in the rebellion.\r\n\r\nSo far as practicable, you will, by means of your military force, expel\r\nguerrillas, marauders, and murderers, and all who are known to harbor,\r\naid, or abet them. But in like manner you will repress assumptions of\r\nunauthorized individuals to perform the same service, because under\r\npretense of doing this they become marauders and murderers themselves.\r\n\r\nTo now restore peace, let the military obey orders, and those not of the\r\nmilitary leave each other alone, thus not breaking the peace themselves.\r\n\r\nIn giving the above directions, it is not intended to restrain you in\r\nother expedient and necessary matters not falling within their range.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C. OCTOBER 2, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHOFIELD:\r\n\r\nI have just seen your despatch to Halleck about Major-General Blunt. If\r\npossible, you better allow me to get through with a certain matter\r\nhere, before adding to the difficulties of it. Meantime supply me the\r\nparticulars of Major-General Blunt's case.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO COLONEL BIRNEY. [Cipher.] WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\nOctober 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL BIRNEY, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nPlease give me, as near as you can, the number of slaves you have\r\nrecruited in Maryland. Of course the number is not to include the free\r\ncolored.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION FOR THANKSGIVING, OCTOBER 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe year that is drawing towards its close has been filled with the\r\nblessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which\r\nare so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from\r\nwhich they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a\r\nnature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which\r\nis habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God.\r\nIn the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity which has\r\nsometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states;\r\npeace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the\r\nlaws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere\r\nexcept in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been\r\ngreatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. The\r\nneedful diversion of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful\r\nindustry, to the national defense has not arrested the plough, the\r\nshuttle, or the ship: The axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements,\r\nand the mines, as well of, iron and coal as of the precious metals, have\r\nyielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily\r\nincreased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp,\r\nthe siege, and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the\r\nconsciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect a\r\ncontinuance of years, with large increase of freedom.\r\n\r\nNo human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these\r\ngreat things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while\r\ndealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be reverently,\r\nsolemnly, and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart and voice, by the\r\nwhole American people. I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every\r\npart of the United States, and also those who are at sea, and those\r\nwho are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last\r\nThursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and prayer to our\r\nbeneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them\r\nthat, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such\r\nsingular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence\r\nfor our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care\r\nall those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the\r\nlamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently\r\nimplore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of\r\nthe nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with divine\r\npurposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this third day of October, in the year\r\nof our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n  Secretary of State\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON D.C., OCTOBER 4, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHOFIELD, St. Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nI think you will not have just cause to complain of my action.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 4, 1863. 11.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Chattanooga, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday received. If we can hold Chattanooga and East\r\nTennessee, I think the rebellion must dwindle and die. I think you and\r\nBurnside can do this, and hence doing so is your main object. Of course\r\nto greatly damage or destroy the enemy in your front would be a greater\r\nobject, because it would include the former and more, but it is not so\r\ncertainly within your power. I understand the main body of the enemy is\r\nvery near you, so near that you could \"board at home,\" so to speak, and\r\nmenace or attack him any day. Would not the doing of this be your best\r\nmode of counteracting his raid on your communications? But this is not an\r\norder. I intend doing something like what you suggest whenever the case\r\nshall appear ripe enough to have it accepted in the true understanding\r\nrather than as a confession of weakness and fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO C. D. DRAKE AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. CHARLES D. DRAKE AND OTHERS, Committee.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:-Your original address, presented on the 30th ult., and the\r\nfour supplementary ones presented on the 3d inst., have been carefully\r\nconsidered. I hope you will regard the other duties claiming my attention,\r\ntogether with the great length and importance of these documents, as\r\nconstituting a sufficient apology for not having responded sooner.\r\n\r\nThese papers, framed for a common object, consist of the things demanded\r\nand the reasons for demanding them.\r\n\r\nThe things demanded are\r\n\r\nFirst. That General Schofield shall be relieved, and General Butler be\r\nappointed as Commander of the Military Department of Missouri.\r\n\r\nSecond. That the system of enrolled militia in Missouri may be broken up,\r\nand national forces he substituted for it; and\r\n\r\nThird. That at elections persons may not be allowed to vote who are not\r\nentitled by law to do so.\r\n\r\nAmong the reasons given, enough of suffering and wrong to Union men is\r\ncertainly, and I suppose truly, stated. Yet the whole case, as presented,\r\nfails to convince me that General Schofield, or the enrolled militia, is\r\nresponsible for that suffering and wrong. The whole can be explained on a\r\nmore charitable, and, as I think, a more rational hypothesis.\r\n\r\nWe are in a civil war. In such cases there always is a main question, but\r\nin this case that question is a perplexing compound--Union and slavery.\r\nIt thus becomes a question not of two sides merely, but of at least four\r\nsides, even among those who are for the Union, saying nothing of those who\r\nare against it. Thus, those who are for the Union with, but not without\r\nslavery; those for it without, but not with; those for it with or without,\r\nbut prefer it with; and those for it with or without, but prefer it\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nAmong these, again, is a subdivision of those who are for gradual, but\r\nnot for immediate, and those who are for immediate, but not for gradual\r\nextinction of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive that all these shades of opinion, and even more,\r\nmay be sincerely entertained by honest and truthful men. Yet, all being\r\nfor the Union, by reason of these differences each will prefer a different\r\nway of sustaining the Union. At once, sincerity is questioned, and motives\r\nare assailed. Actual war comming, blood grows hot and blood is spilled.\r\nThought is forced from old channels into confusion. Deception breeds and\r\nthrives. Confidence dies, and universal suspicion reigns. Each man feels\r\nan impulse to kill his neighbor, lest he be killed by him. Revenge and\r\nretaliation follow. And all this, as before said, may be among honest men\r\nonly. But this is not all. Every foul bird comes abroad, and every dirty\r\nreptile rises up. These add crime to confusion. Strong measures\r\ndeemed indispensable, but harsh at best, such men make worse by\r\nmaladministration. Murders for old grudges, and murders for self, proceed\r\nunder any cloak that will best serve for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThese causes amply account for what has occurred in Missouri, without\r\nascribing it to the weakness or wickedness of any general. The newspaper\r\nfiles, those chroniclers of current events, will show that the evils now\r\ncomplained of were quite as prevalent under Fremont, Hunter, Halleck, and\r\nCurtis, as under Schofield. If the former had greater force opposed\r\nto them, they also had greater force with which to meet it. When the\r\norganized rebel army left the State, the main Federal force had to go\r\nalso, leaving the department commander at home relatively no stronger\r\nthan before. Without disparaging any, I affirm with confidence that no\r\ncommander of that department has, in proportion to his means, done better\r\nthan General Schofield.\r\n\r\nThe first specific charge against General Schofield is, that the enrolled\r\nmilitia was placed under his command, whereas it had not been placed under\r\nthe command of General Curtis. The fact is, I believe, true; but you do\r\nnot point out, nor can I conceive, how that did, or could, injure loyal\r\nmen or the Union cause.\r\n\r\nYou charge that, General Curtis being superseded by General Schofield,\r\nFranklin A. Dick was superseded by James O. Broadhead as Provost-Marshal\r\nGeneral. No very specific showing is made as to how this did or could\r\ninjure the Union cause. It recalls, however, the condition of things, as\r\npresented to me, which led to a change of commander of that department.\r\n\r\nTo restrain contraband intelligence and trade, a system of searches,\r\nseizures, permits, and passes, had been introduced, I think, by General\r\nFremont. When General Halleck came, he found and continued the system, and\r\nadded an order, applicable to some parts of the State, to levy and\r\ncollect contributions from noted rebels, to compensate losses and relieve\r\ndestitution caused by the rebellion. The action of General Fremont and\r\nGeneral Halleck, as stated, constituted a sort of system which General\r\nCurtis found in full operation when he took command of the department.\r\nThat there was a necessity for something of the sort was clear; but that\r\nit could only be justified by stern necessity, and that it was liable to\r\ngreat abuse in administration, was equally clear. Agents to execute it,\r\ncontrary to the great prayer, were led into temptation. Some might, while\r\nothers would not, resist that temptation. It was not possible to hold\r\nany to a very strict accountability; and those yielding to the temptation\r\nwould sell permits and passes to those who would pay most and most readily\r\nfor them, and would seize property and collect levies in the aptest way\r\nto fill their own pockets. Money being the object, the man having money,\r\nwhether loyal or disloyal, would be a victim. This practice doubtless\r\nexisted to some extent, and it was, a real additional evil that it could\r\nbe, and was, plausibly charged to exist in greater extent than it did.\r\n\r\nWhen General Curtis took command of the department, Mr. Dick, against\r\nwhom I never knew anything to allege, had general charge of this system.\r\nA controversy in regard to it rapidly grew into almost unmanageable\r\nproportions. One side ignored the necessity and magnified the evils of the\r\nsystem, while the other ignored the evils and magnified the necessity;\r\nand each bitterly assailed the other. I could not fail to see that the\r\ncontroversy enlarged in the same proportion as the professed Union men\r\nthere distinctly took sides in two opposing political parties. I exhausted\r\nmy wits, and very nearly my patience also, in efforts to convince both\r\nthat the evils they charged on each other were inherent in the case, and\r\ncould not be cured by giving either party a victory over the other.\r\n\r\nPlainly, the irritating system was not to be perpetual; and it was\r\nplausibly urged that it could be modified at once with advantage. The case\r\ncould scarcely be worse, and whether it could be made better could only\r\nbe determined by a trial. In this view, and not to ban or brand General\r\nCurtis, or to give a victory to any party, I made the change of commander\r\nfor the department. I now learn that soon after this change Mr. Dick was\r\nremoved, and that Mr. Broadhead, a gentleman of no less good character,\r\nwas put in the place. The mere fact of this change is more distinctly\r\ncomplained of than is any conduct of the new officer, or other consequence\r\nof the change.\r\n\r\nI gave the new commander no instructions as to the administration of\r\nthe system mentioned, beyond what is contained in the private letter\r\nafterwards surreptitiously published, in which I directed him to act\r\nsolely for the public good, and independently of both parties. Neither any\r\nthing you have presented me, nor anything I have otherwise learned, has\r\nconvinced me that he has been unfaithful to this charge.\r\n\r\nImbecility is urged as one cause for removing General Schofield; and\r\nthe late massacre at Lawrence, Kansas, is pressed as evidence of that\r\nimbecility. To my mind that fact scarcely tends to prove the proposition.\r\nThat massacre is only an example of what Grierson, John Morgan, and many\r\nothers might have repeatedly done on their respective raids, had they\r\nchosen to incur the personal hazard, and possessed the fiendish hearts to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nThe charge is made that General Schofield, on purpose to protect the\r\nLawrence murderers, would not allow them to be pursued into Missouri.\r\nWhile no punishment could be too sudden or too severe for those murderers,\r\nI am well satisfied that the preventing of the threatened remedial raid\r\ninto Missouri was the only way to avoid an indiscriminate massacre there,\r\nincluding probably more innocent than guilty. Instead of condemning, I\r\ntherefore approve what I understand General Schofield did in that respect.\r\n\r\nThe charges that General Schofield has purposely withheld protection from\r\nloyal people and purposely facilitated the objects of the disloyal are\r\naltogether beyond my power of belief. I do not arraign the veracity of\r\ngentlemen as to the facts complained of, but I do more than question the\r\njudgment which would infer that those facts occurred in accordance with\r\nthe purposes of General Schofield.\r\n\r\nWith my present views, I must decline to remove General Schofield. In\r\nthis I decide nothing against General Butler. I sincerely wish it were\r\nconvenient to assign him a suitable command. In order to meet some\r\nexisting evils I have addressed a letter of instructions to General\r\nSchofield, a copy of which I enclose to you.\r\n\r\nAs to the enrolled militia, I shall endeavor to ascertain better than\r\nI now know what is its exact value. Let me say now, however, that your\r\nproposal to substitute national forces for the enrolled militia implies\r\nthat in your judgment the latter is doing something which needs to be\r\ndone; and if so, the proposition to throw that force away and to supply\r\nits place by bringing other forces from the field where they are urgently\r\nneeded seems to me very extraordinary. Whence shall they come? Shall they\r\nbe withdrawn from Banks, or Grant, or Steele, or Rosecrans? Few things\r\nhave been so grateful to my anxious feelings as when, in June last, the\r\nlocal force in Missouri aided General Schofield to so promptly send\r\na large general force to the relief of General Grant, then investing\r\nVicksburg and menaced from without by General Johnston. Was this all\r\nwrong? Should the enrolled militia then have been broken up and General\r\nHerron kept from Grant to police Missouri? So far from finding cause to\r\nobject, I confess to a sympathy for whatever relieves our general force\r\nin Missouri and allows it to serve elsewhere. I therefore, as at present\r\nadvised, cannot attempt the destruction of the enrolled militia of\r\nMissouri. I may add that, the force being under the national military\r\ncontrol, it is also within the proclamation in regard to the habeas\r\ncorpus.\r\n\r\nI concur in the propriety of your request in regard to elections, and\r\nhave, as you see, directed General Schofield accordingly. I do not feel\r\njustified to enter upon the broad field you present in regard to the\r\npolitical differences between Radicals and Conservatives. From time to\r\ntime I have done and said what appeared to me proper to do and say.\r\nThe public knows it all. It obliges nobody to follow me, and I trust it\r\nobliges me to follow nobody. The Radicals and Conservatives each agree\r\nwith me in some things and disagree in others. I could wish both to agree\r\nwith me in all things, for then they would agree with each other, and\r\nwould be too strong for any foe from any quarter. They, however, choose to\r\ndo otherwise; and I do not question their right. I too shall do what\r\nseems to be my duty. I hold whoever commands in Missouri or elsewhere\r\nresponsible to me and not to either Radicals or Conservatives. It is my\r\nduty to hear all, but at last I must, within my sphere, judge what to do\r\nand what to forbear.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF DR. DAVID M. WRIGHT\r\n\r\nAPPROVAL OF THE DECISION OF THE COURT\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERALS OFFICE,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, October 8, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL J. G. FOSTER, Commanding Department of Virginia and North\r\nCarolina, Fort Monroe, Va.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The proceedings of the military commission instituted for the trial\r\nof David Wright, of Norfolk, in Special Orders Nos. 195, 196, and 197, of\r\n1863, from headquarters Department of Virginia, have been submitted to the\r\nPresident of the United States. The following are his remarks on the case:\r\n\r\nUpon the presentation of the record in this case and the examination\r\nthereof, aided by the report thereon of the Judge-Advocate-General, and\r\non full hearing of counsel for the accused, being specified that no proper\r\nquestion remained open except as to the sanity of the accused, I caused a\r\nvery full examination to be made on that question, upon a great amount of\r\nevidence, including all effort by the counsel for accused, by an expert\r\nof high reputation in that professional department, who thereon reports to\r\nme, as his opinion, that the accused, Dr. David M. Wright, was not insane\r\nprior to or on the 11th day of July, 1863, the date of the homicide of\r\nLieutenant Sanborn; that he has not been insane since, and is not insane\r\nnow (Oct. 7, 1863). I therefore approve the finding and sentence of the\r\nmilitary commission, and direct that the major-general in command of the\r\ndepartment including the place of trial, and wherein the convict is now in\r\ncustody, appoint a time and place and carry such sentence into execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I now think the enemy will not\r\nattack Chattanooga, and I think you will have to look out for his making\r\na concentrated drive at Burnside. You and Burnside now have him by the\r\nthroat, and he must break your hold or perish I therefore think you better\r\ntry to hold the road up to Kingston, leaving Burnside to what is above\r\nthere. Sherman is coming to you, though gaps in the telegraph prevent our\r\nknowing how far he is advanced. He and Hooker will so support you on the\r\nwest and northwest as to enable you to look east and northeast. This is\r\nnot an order. General Halleck will give his views.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

This led to a maneuvering of the two armies and to pretty\r\nheavy skirmishing on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. We have frequent\r\ndespatches from General Meade and up to 10 o'clock last night nothing had\r\nhappened giving either side any marked advantage. Our army reported to be\r\nin excellent condition.

I have\r\nnever entertained an unkind feeling or a disparaging thought toward you;\r\nand if I have said or done anything which has been construed into such\r\nunkindness or disparagement, it has been misconstrued.

When he shall\r\nbe, please notify me of the result, with a brief statement of his case, if\r\nhe be convicted. Gustave Blittersdorf, who you say is enlisted in the One\r\nhundred and nineteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers as William Fox, is proven\r\nto me to be only fifteen years old last January. I pardon him, and you\r\nwill discharge him or put him in the ranks at your discretion. Mathias\r\nBrown, of Nineteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers, is proven to me to be\r\neighteen last May, and his friends say he is convicted on an enlistment\r\nand for a desertion both before that time. If this last be true he is\r\npardoned, to be kept or discharged as you please. If not true suspend his\r\nexecution and report the facts of his case.

A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nI do not believe Lee can have over 60,000 effective men.\r\n\r\nLongstreet's corps would not be sent away to bring an equal force back\r\nupon the same road; and there is no other direction for them to have come\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, in making the present movement, Lee gathered in all available\r\nscraps, and added them to Hill's and Ewell's corps; but that is all, and\r\nhe made the movement in the belief that four corps had left General Meade;\r\nand General Meade's apparently avoiding a collision with him has confirmed\r\nhim in that belief. If General Meade can now attack him on a field no\r\nworse than equal for us, and will do so now with all the skill and courage\r\nwhich he, his officers, and men possess, the honor will be his if he\r\nsucceeds, and the blame may be mine if he fails.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Chattanooga, Tenn:\r\n\r\nThere has been no battle recently at Bull Run. I suppose what you have\r\nheard a rumor of was not a general battle, but an \"affair\" at Bristow\r\nStation on the railroad, a few miles beyond Manassas Junction toward the\r\nRappahannock, on Wednesday, the 14th. It began by an attack of the enemy\r\nupon General Warren, and ended in the enemy being repulsed with a loss of\r\nfour cannon and from four to seven hundred prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Have they been sent there by any order, and if so, for what\r\nreason?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. C. SCHENCK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 22, 1863.1.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nPlease come over here. The fact of one of our officers being killed on the\r\nPatuxent is a specimen of what I would avoid. It seems to me we could\r\nsend white men to recruit better than to send negroes and thus inaugurate\r\nhomicides on punctilio.\r\n\r\nPlease come over.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 24, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nTaking all our information together, I think it probable that Ewell's\r\ncorps has started for East Tennessee by way of Abingdon, marching\r\nlast Monday, say from Meade's front directly to the railroad at\r\nCharlottesville.\r\n\r\nFirst, the object of Lee's recent movement against Meade; his destruction\r\nof the Alexandria and Orange Railroad, and subsequent withdrawal\r\nwithout more motive, not otherwise apparent, would be explained by this\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the direct statement of Sharpe's men that Ewell has gone to\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the Irishman's [Northern Spy in Richmond] statement that he has\r\nnot gone through Richmond, and his further statement of an appeal made\r\nto the people at Richmond to go and protect their salt, which could only\r\nrefer to the works near Abingdon.\r\n\r\nFourthly, Graham's statement from Martinsburg that Imboden is in retreat\r\nfor Harrisonburg. This last matches with the idea that Lee has retained\r\nhis cavalry, sending Imboden and perhaps other scraps to join Ewell. Upon\r\nthis probability what is to be done?\r\n\r\nIf you have a plan matured, I have nothing to say. If you have not, then\r\nI suggest that, with all possible expedition, the Army of the Potomac\r\nget ready to attack Lee, and that in the meantime a raid shall, at all\r\nhazards, break the railroad at or near Lynchburg.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 12th has been in my hands several days.\r\nInclosed I send the leave of absence for your brother, in as good form as\r\nI think I can safely put it. Without knowing whether he would accept it. I\r\nhave tendered the collectorship at Portland, Maine, to your other brother,\r\nthe governor.\r\n\r\nThanks to both you and our friend Campbell for your kind words and\r\nintentions. A second term would be a great honor and a great labor, which,\r\ntogether, perhaps I would not decline if tendered.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CHASE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The writer of the accompanying letter is one of Mrs.\r\nLincoln's numerous cousins. He is a grandson of \"Milliken's Bend,\" near\r\nVicksburg--that is, a grandson of the man who gave name to Milliken's\r\nBend. His father was a brother to MRS. Lincoln's mother.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAPERS AND WRITINGS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\nVOLUME SEVEN\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL EDITION\r\n\r\nBy Abraham Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited by Arthur Brooks Lapsley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF A. LINCOLN, Volume Seven, 1863-1865\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1863\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINION ON THE LOSS OF GENERAL R. H. MILROY'S DIVISION.\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn June last a division was substantially lost at or near Winchester, Va.\r\nAt the time, it was under General Milroy as immediate commander in the\r\nfield, General Schenck as department commander at Baltimore, and General\r\nHalleck as general-in-chief at Washington.\r\n\r\nGeneral Milroy, as immediate commander, was put in arrest, and\r\nsubsequently a court of inquiry examined chiefly with reference to\r\ndisobedience of orders, and reported the evidence.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a synoptical statement of the evidence, together with the\r\njudge-advocate-general's conclusions. The disaster, when it came, was a\r\nsurprise to all. It was very well known to Generals Shenck and Milroy for\r\nsome time before, that General Halleck thought the division was in great\r\ndanger of a surprise at Winchester; that it was of no service commensurate\r\nwith the risk it incurred, and that it ought to be withdrawn; but,\r\nalthough he more than once advised its withdrawal, he never positively\r\nordered it. General Schenck, on the contrary, believed the service of the\r\nforce at Winchester was worth the hazard, and so did not positively\r\norder its withdrawal until it was so late that the enemy cut the wire and\r\nprevented the order reaching General Milroy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Milroy seems to have concurred with General Schenck in the opinion\r\nthat the force should be kept at Winchester at least until the approach of\r\ndanger, but he disobeyed no order upon the subject.\r\n\r\nSome question can be made whether some of General Halleck's dispatches to\r\nGeneral Schenk should not have been construed to be orders to withdraw the\r\nforce, and obeyed accordingly; but no such question can be made against\r\nGeneral Milroy. In fact, the last order he received was to be prepared to\r\nwithdraw, but not to actually withdraw until further order, which further\r\norder never reached him.\r\n\r\nSerious blame is not necessarily due to any serious disaster, and I cannot\r\nsay that in this case any of the officers are deserving of serious blame.\r\nNo court-martial is deemed necessary or proper in the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nPrivate and confidential\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD:\r\n\r\nThere have recently reached the War Department, and thence been laid\r\nbefore me, from Missouri, three communications, all similar in import and\r\nidentical in object. One of them, addressed to nobody, and without place\r\nor date, but having the signature of (apparently) the writer, is a letter\r\nof eight closely written foolscap pages. The other two are written by\r\na different person, at St. Joseph, Mo., and of the dates, respectively,\r\nOctober 12 and 13, 1863, and each inclosing a large number of affidavits.\r\nThe general statements of the whole are that the Federal and State\r\nauthorities are arming the disloyal and disarming the loyal, and that the\r\nlatter will all be killed or driven out of the State unless there shall be\r\na change. In particular, no loyal man who has been disarmed is named, but\r\nthe affidavits show by name forty-two persons as disloyal who have been\r\narmed. They are as follows: [The names are omitted.]\r\n\r\nA majority of these are shown to have been in the rebel service. I believe\r\nit could be shown that the government here has deliberately armed more\r\nthan ten times as many captured at Gettysburg, to say nothing of similar\r\noperations in East Tennessee. These papers contain altogether thirty--one\r\nmanuscript pages, and one newspaper in extenso, and yet I do not find it\r\nanywhere charged in them that any loyal man has been harmed by reason of\r\nbeing disarmed, or that any disloyal one has harmed anybody by reason of\r\nbeing armed by the Federal or State Government. Of course, I have not had\r\ntime to carefully examine all; but I have had most of them examined and\r\nbriefed by others, and the result is as stated. The remarkable fact that\r\nthe actual evil is yet only anticipated--inferred--induces me to suppose I\r\nunderstand the case; but I do not state my impression, because I might\r\nbe mistaken, and because your duty and mine is plain in any event. The\r\nlocality of nearly all this seems to be St. Joseph and Buchanan County.\r\nI wish you to give special attention to this region, particularly on\r\nelection day. Prevent violence from whatever quarter, and see that the\r\nsoldiers themselves do no wrong.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

W. GRIMES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., October 29, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES W. GRIMES.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The above act of Congress was passed, as I suppose, for\r\nthe purpose of shutting out improper applicants for seats in the House of\r\nRepresentatives; and I fear there is some danger that it will be used to\r\nshut out proper ones. Iowa, having an entire Union delegation, will be\r\none of the States the attempt will be made, if upon any. The Governor\r\ndoubtless has made out the certificates, and they are already in the\r\nhands of the members. I suggest that they come on with them; but that, for\r\ngreater caution, you, and perhaps Mr. Harlan with you, consult with the\r\nGovernor, and have an additional set made out according to the form on the\r\nother half of this sheet; and still another set, if you can, by studying\r\nthe law, think of a form that in your judgment, promises additional\r\nsecurity, and quietly bring the whole on with you, to be used in case of\r\nnecessity. Let what you do be kept still.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO P. F. LOWE.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. F. F. LOWE, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nBelow is an act of Congress, passed last session, intended to exclude\r\napplicants not entitled to seats, but which, there is reason to fear, will\r\nbe used to exclude some who are entitled. Please get with the Governor\r\nand one or two other discreet friends, study the act carefully, and make\r\ncertificates in two or three forms, according to your best judgement,\r\nand have them sent to me, so as to multiply the chances of the delegation\r\ngetting their seats. Let it be done without publicity. Below is a form\r\nwhich may answer for one. If you could procure the same to be done for the\r\nOregon member it might be well.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nMuch obliged for the information about deserters contained in your\r\ndispatch of yesterday, while I have to beg your pardon for troubling you\r\nin regard to some of them, when, as it appears by yours, I had the means\r\nof answering my own questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe Provost-Marshal-General has issued no proclamation at all. He has\r\nin no form announced anything recently in regard to troops in New York,\r\nexcept in his letter to Governor Seymour of October 21, which has been\r\npublished in the newspapers of that State. It has not been announced or\r\ndecided in any form by the Provost-Marshal-General, or any one else in\r\nauthority of the Government, that every citizen who has paid his three\r\nhundred dollars commutation is liable to be immediately drafted again, or\r\nthat towns that have just raised the money to pay their quotas will have\r\nagain to be subject to similar taxation or suffer the operations of the\r\nnew conscription, nor it is probable that the like of them ever will be\r\nannounced or decided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 1, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD, Auburn, N.Y.:\r\n\r\nNo important news. Details of Hooker's night fight do great credit to his\r\ncommand, and particularly to the Eleventh Corps and Geary's part of the\r\nTwelfth. No discredit on any.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO POSTMASTER-GENERAL BLAIR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 2, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. MONTGOMERY BLAIR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Some days ago I understood you to say that your brother,\r\nGeneral Frank Blair, desires to be guided by my wishes as to whether he\r\nwill occupy his seat in Congress or remain in the field. My wish, then, is\r\ncompounded of what I believe will be best for the country; and it is that\r\nhe will come here, put his military commission in my hands, take his seat,\r\ngo into caucus with our friends, abide the nominations, help elect the\r\nnominees, and thus aid to organize a House of Representatives which will\r\nreally support the Government in the war. If the result shall be the\r\nelection of himself as Speaker, let him serve in that position. If not,\r\nlet him retake his commission and return to the army for the benefit of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThis will heal a dangerous schism for him. It will relieve him from a\r\ndangerous position or a misunderstanding, as I think he is in danger of\r\nbeing permanently separated from those with whom only he can ever have a\r\nreal sympathy--the sincere opponents of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt will be a mistake if he shall allow the provocations offered him by\r\ninsincere time-servers to drive him from the house of his own building. He\r\nis young yet. He has abundant talents--quite enough to occupy all his time\r\nwithout devoting any to temper.\r\n\r\nHe is rising in military skill and usefulness. His recent appointment to\r\nthe command of a corps, by one so competent to judge as General Sherman,\r\nproves this. In that line he can serve both the country and himself more\r\nprofitably than he could as a member of Congress upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is what I would say if Frank Blair was my brother instead of\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR BRADFORD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 2, 1863.\r\n\r\nHis EXCELLENCY A. W. BRADFORD, Governor of Maryland.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Yours of the 31st ult. was received yesterday about noon, and since\r\nthen I have been giving most earnest attention to the subject-matter\r\nof it. At my call General Schenck has attended, and he assures me it is\r\nalmost certain that violence will be used at some of the voting places on\r\nelection day unless prevented by his provost-guards. He says that at some\r\nof those places Union voters will not attend at all, or run a ticket,\r\nunless they have some assurance of protection. This makes the Missouri\r\ncase, of my action in regard to which you express your approval.\r\n\r\nThe remaining point of your letter is a protest against any person\r\noffering to vote being put to any test not found in the laws of Maryland.\r\nThis brings us to a difference between Missouri and Maryland. With the\r\nsame reason in both States, Missouri has, by law, provided a test for the\r\nvoter with reference to the present rebellion, while Maryland has not. For\r\nexample, General Trimble, captured fighting us at Gettysburg, is, without\r\nrecanting his treason, a legal voter by the laws of Maryland. Even General\r\nSchenck's order admits him to vote, if he recants upon oath. I think that\r\nis cheap enough. My order in Missouri, which you approve, and General\r\nScherick's order here, reach precisely the same end. Bach assures the\r\nright of voting to all loyal men, and whether a man is loyal, each allows\r\nthat man to fix by his own oath. Your suggestion that nearly all the\r\ncandidates are loyal, I do not think quite meets the case. In this\r\nstruggle for the nation's life, I cannot so confidently rely on those\r\nwhose elections may have depended upon disloyal votes. Such men, when\r\nelected, may prove true; but such votes are given them in the expectation\r\nthat they will prove false.\r\n\r\nNor do I think that to keep the peace at the polls, and to prevent the\r\npersistently disloyal from voting, constitutes just cause of offense to\r\nMaryland. I think she has her own example for it. If I mistake not, it is\r\nprecisely what General Dix did when your Excellency was elected Governor.\r\n\r\nI revoke the first of the three propositions in General Schenek's General\r\nOrder No. 53; not that it is wrong in principle, but because the military,\r\nbeing of necessity exclusive judges as to who shall be arrested, the\r\nprovision is too liable to abuse. For the revoked part I substitute the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nThat, all provost-marshals and other military officers do prevent all\r\ndisturbance and violence at or about the polls, whether offered by such\r\npersons as above described, or by any other person or persons whomsoever.\r\n\r\nThe other two propositions of the order I allow to stand. General Schenek\r\nis fully determined, and has my strict orders besides, that all loyal men\r\nmay vote, and vote for whom they please.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. H. HACKETT\r\n\r\n[Private.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 2, 1863.\r\n\r\nJAMES H. HACKETT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of October 22d is received, as also was, in\r\ndue course, that of October 3d. I look forward with pleasure to the\r\nfulfillment of the promise made in the former to visit Washington the\r\nfollowing winter and to \"call.\"\r\n\r\nGive yourself no uneasiness on the subject mentioned in that of the 22d.\r\nMy note to you I certainly did not expect to see in print, yet I have not\r\nbeen much shocked by the newspaper comments upon it.\r\n\r\nThose comments constitute a fair specimen of what has occurred to me\r\nthrough life. I have endured a great deal of ridicule, without much\r\nmalice; and have received a great deal of kindness not quite free from\r\nridicule. I am used to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, November 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD, Auburn, N. Y.:\r\n\r\nNothing new.

His own\r\nstory is rather a bad one, and yet he tells it so frankly, that I\r\nam somewhat interested in him. Has he been a good soldier except the\r\ndesertion? About how old is he?\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, November\r\n9, 1863.4 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Knoxville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nHave seen dispatch from General Grant about your loss at Rogersville. Per\r\ncontra, about the same time, Averell and Duffle got considerable advantage\r\nof the enemy at and about Lewisburg, Virginia: and on Saturday, the\r\nseventh, Meade drove the enemy from Rappahannock Station and Kelly's Ford,\r\ncapturing eight battle-flags, four guns, and over 1800 prisoners, with\r\nvery little loss to himself.

C., November 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\n I see a dispatch here from Saint Louis, which is a little difficult\r\nfor me to understand. It says \"General Schofield has refused leave of\r\nabsence to members in military service to attend the legislature. All such\r\nare radical and administration men. The election of two Senators from\r\nthis place on Thursday will probably turn upon this thing.\" what does this\r\nmean? Of course members of the legislation must be allowed to attend its\r\nsessions. But how is there a session before the recent election returns\r\nare in? And how is it to be at \"this place\"--and that is Saint Louis?\r\nPlease inform me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

Of the reports\r\nyou mention, I have not the means of seeing any except your own. Besides\r\nthis, the publication might be improper in view of the court of inquiry\r\nwhich has been ordered.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CHASE\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I expected to see you here at Cabinet meeting, and to say\r\nsomething about going to Gettysburg. There will be a train to take and\r\nreturn us. The time for starting is not yet fixed, but when it shall be I\r\nwill notify you.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT GETTYSBURG\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 19, 1863.\r\n\r\nFour score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this\r\ncontinent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the\r\nproposition that all men are created equal.\r\n\r\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or\r\nany nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a\r\ngreat battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that\r\nfield, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that\r\nthat nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should\r\ndo this.\r\n\r\nBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate--we can not consecrate--we\r\ncan not hallow--this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled\r\nhere, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.\r\nThe world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can\r\nnever forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be\r\ndedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus\r\nfar so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the\r\ngreat task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take\r\nincreased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure\r\nof devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have\r\ndied in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of\r\nfreedom--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people,\r\nshall not perish from the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nIf there is a man by the name of King under sentence to be shot, please\r\nsuspend execution till further order, and send record.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON. November 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nAn intelligent woman in deep distress, called this morning, saying her\r\nhusband, a lieutenant in the Army of Potomac, was to be shot next Monday\r\nfor desertion, and putting a letter in my hand, upon which I relied for\r\nparticulars, she left without mentioning a name or other particular by\r\nwhich to identify the case. On opening the letter I found it equally\r\nvague, having nothing to identify by, except her own signature, which\r\nseems to be \"Mrs. Anna S. King.\" I could not again find her. If you have\r\na case which you shall think is probably the one intended, please apply my\r\ndispatch of this morning to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO E. P. EVANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nE. P. EVANS, West Union, Adams County, Ohio:\r\n\r\nYours to Governor Chase in behalf of John A Welch is before me. Can there\r\nbe a worse case than to desert and with letters persuading others to\r\ndesert? I cannot interpose without a better showing than you make. When\r\ndid he desert? when did he write the letters?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., November 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Two despatches since I saw you; one not quite so late on\r\nfiring as we had before, but giving the points that Burnside thinks he\r\ncan hold the place, that he is not closely invested, and that he forages\r\nacross the river. The other brings the firing up to 11 A.M. yesterday,\r\nbeing twenty-three hours later than we had before.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 25, 1863. 8.40 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL U.S. GRANT:\r\n\r\nYour despatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here. Well done!\r\nMany thanks to all. Remember Burnside.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO C. P. KIRKLAND.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nCHARLES P. KIRKLAND, ESQ., New York:\r\n\r\nI have just received and have read your published letter to the HON.\r\nBenjamin R. Curtis. Under the circumstances I may not be the most\r\ncompetent judge, but it appears to me to be a paper of great ability, and\r\nfor the country's sake more than for my own I thank you for it.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT OF UNION SUCCESS IN EAST TENNESSEE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nReliable information being received that the insurgent force is retreating\r\nfrom East Tennessee, under circumstances rendering it probable that the\r\nUnion forces cannot hereafter be dislodged from that important position;\r\nand esteeming this to be of high national consequence, I recommend that\r\nall loyal people do, on receipt of this information, assemble at their\r\nplaces of worship, and render special homage and gratitude to Almighty God\r\nfor this great advancement of the national cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF AMNESTY AND RECONSTRUCTION. DECEMBER 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas in and by the Constitution of the United States it is provided\r\nthat the President \"shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for\r\noffenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment;\" and,\r\n\r\nWhereas a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal State governments of\r\nseveral States have for a long time been subverted, and many persons have\r\ncommitted and are now guilty of treason against the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, with reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been\r\nenacted by Congress declaring forfeitures and confiscation of property and\r\nliberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated, and\r\nalso declaring that the President was thereby authorized at any\r\ntime thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have\r\nparticipated in the existing rebellion in any State or part thereof pardon\r\nand amnesty, with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions\r\nas he may deem expedient for the public welfare; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the Congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon\r\naccords with well-established judicial exposition of the pardoning power;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas, with reference to said rebellion, the President of the United\r\nStates has issued several proclamations with provisions in regard to the\r\nliberation of slaves; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said\r\nrebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States and to\r\nreinaugurate loyal State governments within and for their respective\r\nStates:\r\n\r\nTherefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\r\nproclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have, directly or by\r\nimplication, participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter\r\nexcepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them,\r\nwith restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves and in\r\nproperty cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened, and\r\nupon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath\r\nand thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath\r\nshall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor\r\nand effect following, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"I, ------, do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty God, that I will\r\nhenceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and the Union of the States thereunder; and that I will in\r\nlike manner abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed\r\nduring the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far\r\nas not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress or by decision of\r\nthe Supreme Court; and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully\r\nsupport all proclamations of the President made during the existing\r\nrebellion having reference to slaves, so long and so far as not modified\r\nor declared void by decision of the Supreme Court. So help me God.\"\r\n\r\nThe persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all\r\nwho are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the\r\nso-called Confederate Government; all who have left judicial stations\r\nunder the United States to aid the rebellion; all who are or shall have\r\nbeen military or naval officers of said so-called Confederate Government\r\nabove the rank of colonel in the army or of lieutenant in the navy; all\r\nwho left seats in the United States Congress to aid the rebellion; all\r\nwho resigned commissions in the Army or Navy of the United States and\r\nafterwards aided the rebellion; and all who have engaged in any way in\r\ntreating colored persons, or white persons in charge of such, otherwise\r\nthan lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons may have been\r\nfound in the United States service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nAnd I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that whenever, in\r\nany of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee,\r\nAlabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of\r\npersons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such State\r\nat the Presidential election of the year A.D. 1860, each having taken oath\r\naforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter\r\nby the election law of the State existing immediately before the so-called\r\nact of secession, and excluding all others, shall reestablish a State\r\ngovernment which shall be republican and in nowise contravening said oath,\r\nsuch shall be recognized as the true government of the State, and\r\nthe State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional\r\nprovision which declares that \"the United States shall guarantee to every\r\nState in this Union a republican form of government and shall protect each\r\nof them against invasion, and, on application of the legislature, or the\r\nEXECUTIVE (when the legislature can not be convened), against domestic\r\nviolence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that any provision\r\nwhich may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed\r\npeople of such State which shall recognize and declare their permanent\r\nfreedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent as\r\na temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,\r\nlandless, and homeless class, will not be objected to by the National\r\nEXECUTIVE.\r\n\r\nAnd it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal\r\nState government in any State the name of the State, the boundary, the\r\nsubdivisions, the constitution, and the general code of laws as before the\r\nrebellion be maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary\r\nby the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if any, not\r\ncontravening said co and which may be deemed expedient by those framing\r\nthe new State government.\r\n\r\nTo avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation,\r\nso far as it relates to State governments, has no reference to States\r\nwherein loyal State governments have all the while been maintained. And\r\nfor the same reason it may be proper to further say that whether\r\nmembers sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted to seats\r\nconstitutionally rests exclusively with the respective Houses, and not to\r\nany extent with the EXECUTIVE. And, still further, that this proclamation\r\nis intended to present the people of the States wherein the national\r\nauthority has been suspended and loyal State governments have been\r\nsubverted a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal State\r\ngovernments may be re-established within said States or in any of them;\r\nand while the mode presented is the best the EXECUTIVE can suggest, with\r\nhis present impressions, it must not be understood that no other possible\r\nmode would be acceptable.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand at the city of WASHINGTON, the 8th day of December,\r\nA. D. 1863, and of the Independence of the United States of America the\r\neighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS, DECEMBER 8, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:--\r\n\r\nAnother year of health, and of sufficiently abundant harvests, has passed.\r\nFor these, and especially for the improved condition cf our national\r\naffairs, our renewed and profoundest gratitude to God is due.\r\n\r\nWe remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us in\r\nforeign wars, to aid an inexcusable insurrection, have been unavailing.\r\nHer Britannic Majesty's government, as was justly expected, have exercised\r\ntheir authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions from\r\nBritish ports. The Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly\r\nvindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the\r\ncontest. Questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out of\r\nthe blockade, and other belligerent operations, between the Government and\r\nseveral of the maritime powers, but they have been discussed, and, as\r\nfar as was possible, accommodated, in a spirit of frankness, justice, and\r\nmutual good-will. It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, by\r\nthe impartiality of their adjudications, have commanded the respect and\r\nconfidence of maritime powers.\r\n\r\nThe supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain\r\nfor the suppression of the African slave-trade, made on the 17th day of\r\nFebruary last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution. It\r\nis believed that, so far as American ports and American citizens are\r\nconcerned, that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end.\r\n\r\nI shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a convention for the\r\nadjustment of possessory claims in Washington Territory, arising out of\r\nthe treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among the\r\ncitizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country.\r\n\r\nA novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime\r\njurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island of Cuba,\r\nhas been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed, in\r\nan amicable spirit, to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power. A\r\nconvention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the Senate, to\r\nconcur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the\r\nliquidation of the Scheldt dues upon the principles which have been\r\nheretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters\r\nof Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending controversy between this government and that of Chile\r\ntouching the seizure at Sitana, in Peru, by Chilean officers, of a large\r\namount in treasure belonging to citizens of the United States has been\r\nbrought to a close by the award of His Majesty the King of the Belgians,\r\nto whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties. The subject\r\nwas thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate,\r\nand although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as\r\nlarge as they expected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of His\r\nMajesty's decision. That decision was promptly complied with by Chile when\r\nintelligence in regard to it reached that country.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission under the act of the last session of carrying\r\ninto effect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims has been\r\norganized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it.\r\n\r\nDifficulties concerning interoceanic transit through Nicaragua are in\r\ncourse of amicable adjustment.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message, I have\r\nreceived a representative from the United States of Colombia, and have\r\naccredited a minister to that Republic.\r\n\r\nIncidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon\r\nmy attention the uncertain state of international questions touching the\r\nrights of foreigners in this country and of United States citizens abroad.\r\nIn regard to some governments these rights are at least partially defined\r\nby treaties. In no instance, however, is it expressly stipulated that in\r\nthe event of civil war a foreigner residing in this country within the\r\nlines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the rule which classes him\r\nas a belligerent, in whose behalf the government of his country can not\r\nexpect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character. I regret\r\nto say, however, that such claims have been put forward, and in some\r\ninstances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the United States the\r\ngreater part of their lives.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries who\r\nhave declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been fully\r\nnaturalized have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the\r\nfact and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden of proof. It has\r\nbeen found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want\r\nof guides to the proper sources of information. These might be supplied by\r\nrequiring clerks of courts where declarations of intention may be made or\r\nnaturalizations effected to send periodically lists of the names of the\r\npersons naturalized or declaring their intention to become citizens to\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, in whose Department those names might be\r\narranged and printed for general information.\r\n\r\nThere is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens\r\nof the United States for the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the\r\nlaws of their native countries, to which on becoming naturalized here they\r\nat once repair, and though never returning to the United States they still\r\nclaim the interposition of this government as citizens. Many altercations\r\nand great prejudices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse. It is\r\ntherefore submitted to your serious consideration. It might be advisable\r\nto fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the United States residing\r\nabroad may claim the interposition of his government.\r\n\r\nThe right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens under\r\npretenses of naturalization, which they have disavowed when drafted into\r\nthe military service. I submit the expediency of such an amendment of\r\nthe law as will make the fact of voting an estoppe against any plea of\r\nexemption from military service or other civil obligation on the ground of\r\nalienage.\r\n\r\nIn common with other Western powers, our relations with Japan have been\r\nbrought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the\r\nhereditary aristocracy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberal policy\r\nof the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society of nations.\r\nIt is hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these difficulties\r\nmay be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to the claim of the\r\nminister residing there for the damages he sustained in the destruction by\r\nfire of the residence of the legation at Yedo.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia,\r\nwhich, it is believed, will result in effecting a continuous line of\r\ntelegraph through that Empire from our Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an\r\ninternational telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also of a telegraph\r\nbetween this capital and the national forts along the Atlantic seaboard\r\nand the Gulf of Mexico. Such communications, established with any\r\nreasonable outlay, would be economical as well as effective aids to the\r\ndiplomatic, military, and naval service.\r\n\r\nThe consular system of the United States, under the enactments of the last\r\nCongress, begins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that\r\nit may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue\r\nwhenever peace is restored. Our ministers abroad have been faithful in\r\ndefending American rights. In protecting commercial interests our consuls\r\nhave necessarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibilities\r\ngrowing out of the war. These they have for the most part met and\r\ndischarged with zeal and efficiency. This acknowledgment justly includes\r\nthose consuls who, residing in Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, Japan, China,\r\nand other Oriental countries, are charged with complex functions and\r\nextraordinary powers.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the several organized Territories is generally\r\nsatisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been\r\nentirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho,\r\nNew Mexico, and Arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore\r\nunderstood. I lay before you a communication on this subject from\r\nthe Governor of New Mexico. I again submit to your consideration the\r\nexpediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration.\r\nAlthough this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with\r\ngreater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred,\r\nthere is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry,\r\nespecially in agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron and coal as\r\nof the precious metals. While the demand for labor is much increased here,\r\ntens of thousands of persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, are\r\nthronging our foreign consulates and offering to emigrate to the United\r\nStates if essential, but very cheap, assistance can be afforded them. It\r\nis easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation\r\nis beginning a new life. This noble effort demands the aid and ought to\r\nreceive the attention and support of the Government.\r\n\r\nInjuries unforeseen by the Government and unintended may in some cases\r\nhave been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries, both\r\nat sea and on land, by persons in the service of the United States. As\r\nthis government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries\r\nare inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the United\r\nStates, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners. If the existing\r\njudicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a special court may\r\nbe authorized, with power to hear and decide such claims of the character\r\nreferred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public law.\r\nConventions for adjusting the claims by joint commission have been\r\nproposed to some governments, but no definitive answer to the proposition\r\nhas yet been received from any.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the session I shall probably have occasion to request you\r\nto provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have\r\nbeen rendered and damages awarded by admiralty courts, and in other cases\r\nwhere this government may be acknowledged to be liable in principle and\r\nwhere the amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nThe proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by the\r\nlaw of the United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon the\r\nincomes of foreign consuls in this country. While such a demand may not\r\nin strictness be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any existing\r\ntreaty between the United States and a foreign country, the expediency of\r\nso far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such consuls\r\nas are not citizens of the United States, derived from the emoluments\r\nof their office or from property not situated in the United States, is\r\nsubmitted to your serious consideration. I make this suggestion upon the\r\nground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated exempts our consuls in\r\nall other countries from taxation to the extent thus indicated. The United\r\nStates, I think, ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international\r\ntrade and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Treasury during the last year have been successfully\r\nconducted. The enactment by Congress of a national banking law has proved\r\na valuable support of the public credit, and the general legislation in\r\nrelation to loans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers.\r\nSome amendments may be required to perfect existing laws, but no change in\r\ntheir principles or general scope is believed to be needed.\r\n\r\nSince these measures have been in operation all demands on the Treasury,\r\nincluding the pay of the Army and Navy, have been promptly met and fully\r\nsatisfied. No considerable body of troops, it is believed, were ever more\r\namply provided and more liberally and punctually paid, and it may be\r\nadded that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war ever more\r\ncheerfully borne.\r\n\r\nThe receipts during the year from all sources, including loans and\r\nbalance in the Treasury at its commencement, were $901,125,674.86, and the\r\naggregate disbursements $895,796,630.65, leaving a balance on the 1st\r\nof July, 1863, of $5,329,044.21. Of the receipts there were derived from\r\ncustoms $69,059,642.40, from internal revenue $37,640,787.95, from direct\r\ntax $1,485,103.61, from lands $167,617.17, from miscellaneous sources\r\n$3,046,615.35, and from loans $776,682,361.57, making the aggregate\r\n$901,125,674.86. Of the disbursements there were for the civil service\r\n$23,253,922.08, for pensions and Indians $4,216,520.79, for interest on\r\npublic debt $24,729,846.51, for the War Department $599,298,600.83, for\r\nthe Navy Department $63,211,105.27, for payment of funded and temporary\r\ndebt $181,086,635.07, making the aggregate $895,796,630.65 and leaving the\r\nbalance of $5,329,044.21. But the payment of funded and temporary debt,\r\nhaving been made from moneys borrowed during the year, must be regarded\r\nas merely nominal payments and the moneys borrowed to make them as merely\r\nnominal receipts, and their amount, $181,086,635.07, should therefore\r\nbe deducted both from receipts and disbursements. This being done there\r\nremains as actual receipts $720,039,039.79 and the actual disbursements\r\n$714,709,995.58, leaving the balance as already stated.\r\n\r\nThe actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the\r\nestimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three-quarters of\r\nthe current fiscal year (1864) will be shown in detail by the report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, to which I invite your attention. It is\r\nsufficient to say here that it is not believed that actual results will\r\nexhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the\r\nestimates of that officer heretofore submitted while it is confidently\r\nexpected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debt will be\r\nfound very considerably less than has been anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War is a document of great interest. It\r\nconsists of:\r\n\r\n1. The military operations of the year, detailed in the report of the\r\nGeneral in Chief.\r\n\r\n2. The organization of colored persons into the war service.\r\n\r\n3. The exchange of prisoners, fully set forth in the letter of General\r\nHitchcock.\r\n\r\n4. The operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the national\r\nforces, detailed in the report of the Provost Marshal General.\r\n\r\n5. The organization of the invalid corps, and\r\n\r\n6. The operation of the several departments of the Quartermaster-General,\r\nCommissary-General, Paymaster-General, Chief of Engineers, Chief of\r\nOrdnance, and Surgeon-General.\r\n\r\nIt has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report,\r\nexcept such as would be too extended for this place, and hence I content\r\nmyself by asking your careful attention to the report itself.\r\n\r\nThe duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year\r\nand throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have been discharged with\r\nfidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been constantly\r\nincreasing in efficiency as the Navy has expanded, yet on so long a line\r\nit has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade. From\r\nreturns received at the Navy Department it appears that more than 1,000\r\nvessels have been captured since the blockade was instituted? and that\r\nthe value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts to over\r\n$13,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe naval force of the United States consists at this time of five hundred\r\nand eighty-eight vessels completed and in the course of completion, and of\r\nthese seventy-five are ironclad or armored steamers. The events of the war\r\ngive an increased interest and importance to the Navy which will probably\r\nextend beyond the war itself.\r\n\r\nThe armored vessels in our Navy completed and in service, or which are\r\nunder contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed in\r\nnumber those of any other power; but while these may be relied upon for\r\nharbor defense and coast service, others of greater strength and capacity\r\nwill be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain our rightful\r\nposition on the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare since\r\nthe introduction of steam as a motive power for ships of war demands\r\neither a corresponding change in some of our existing navy yards or the\r\nestablishment of new ones for the construction and necessary repair of\r\nmodern naval vessels. No inconsiderable embarrassment, delay, and\r\npublic injury have been experienced from the want of such governmental\r\nestablishments. The necessity of such a navy-yard, so furnished, at some\r\nsuitable place upon the Atlantic seaboard has on repeated occasions been\r\nbrought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is\r\nagain presented in the report of the Secretary which accompanies this\r\ncommunication. I think it my duty to invite your special attention to\r\nthis subject, and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for naval\r\npurposes upon one of the Western rivers. A naval force has been created\r\non those interior waters, and under many disadvantages, within little more\r\nthan two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country\r\nat the commencement of the present Administration. Satisfactory and\r\nimportant as have been the performances of the heroic men of the Navy at\r\nthis interesting period, they are scarcely more wonderful than the success\r\nof our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels, which has\r\ncreated a new form of naval power.\r\n\r\nOur country has advantages superior to any other nation in our resources\r\nof iron and timber, with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in the immediate\r\nvicinity of both, and all available and in close proximity to navigable\r\nwaters. Without the advantage of public works, the resources of the nation\r\nhave been developed and its power displayed in the construction of a Navy\r\nof such magnitude, which has at the very period of its creation rendered\r\nsignal service to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7,500\r\nmen in the spring of 1861 to about 34,000 at the present time has been\r\naccomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties to\r\npromote that increase. It has been found, however, that the operation of\r\nthe draft, with the high bounties paid for army recruits, is beginning\r\nto affect injuriously the naval service, and will, if not corrected, be\r\nlikely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper\r\nvocation and inducing them to enter the Army. I therefore respectfully\r\nsuggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval services by\r\na definite provision on this subject which would at the same time be\r\nequitable to the communities more especially interested.\r\n\r\nI commend to your consideration the suggestions of the Secretary of the\r\nNavy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen and also\r\nthe education of officers and engineers for the naval service. The Naval\r\nAcademy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen for the highly\r\nresponsible duties which in after life they will be required to perform.\r\nIn order that the country should not be deprived of the proper quota of\r\neducated officers, for which legal provision has been made at the\r\nnaval school, the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make\r\nnominations from the States in insurrection have been filled by the\r\nSecretary of the Navy. The school is now more full and complete than\r\nat any former period, and in every respect entitled to the favorable\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the past fiscal year the financial condition of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment has been one of increasing prosperity, and I am gratified in\r\nbeing able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaled the\r\nentire expenditures, the latter amounting to $11,314,206.84 and the former\r\nto $11,163,789.59, leaving a deficiency of but $150,417.25. In 1860,\r\nthe year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to\r\n$5,656,705.49, the postal receipts of that year being $2,645,722.19\r\nless that those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of\r\ntransportation has been only about twenty-five per cent, but the annual\r\nexpenditure on account of the same has been reduced thirty-five per cent.\r\nIt is manifest, therefore, that the Post-Office Department may become\r\nself-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of the whole\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe international conference of postal delegates from the principal\r\ncountries of Europe and America, which was called at the suggestion of the\r\nPostmaster-General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last and concluded\r\nits deliberations on the 8th of June. The principles established by\r\nthe conference as best adapted to facilitate postal intercourse between\r\nnations and as the basis of future postal conventions inaugurate a general\r\nsystem of uniform international charges at reduced rates of postage, and\r\ncan not fail to produce beneficial results.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is\r\nherewith laid before you, for useful and varied information in relation to\r\nthe public lands, Indian affairs, patents, pensions, and other matters of\r\npublic concern pertaining to his Department.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarter of\r\nthe present fiscal years was 3,841,549 acres, of which 161,911 acres were\r\nsold for cash, 1,456,514 acres were taken up under the homestead law, and\r\nthe residue disposed of under laws granting lands for military bounties,\r\nfor railroad and other purposes. It also appears that the sale of the\r\npublic lands is largely on the increase.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmen that\r\nthe people of the United States had a higher and more enduring interest in\r\nthe early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public lands than\r\nin the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sale of them. This\r\nopinion has had a controlling influence in shaping legislation upon the\r\nsubject of our national domain. I may cite as evidence of this the liberal\r\nmeasures adopted in reference to actual settlers; the grant to the States\r\nof the overflowed lands within their limits, in order to their being\r\nreclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation; the grants to railway\r\ncompanies of alternate sections of land upon the contemplated lines of\r\ntheir roads, which when completed will so largely multiply the facilities\r\nfor reaching our distant possessions. This policy has received its most\r\nsignal and beneficent illustration in the recent enactment granting\r\nhomesteads to actual settlers. Since the 1st day of January last the\r\nbefore-mentioned quantity of 1,456,514 acres of land have been taken up\r\nunder its provisions. This fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying\r\nevidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands, notwithstanding\r\nthe great struggle in which the energies of the nation have been engaged,\r\nand which has required so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their\r\naccustomed pursuits. I cordially concur in the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior suggesting a modification of the act in favor\r\nof those engaged in the military and naval service of the United States.\r\nI doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will,\r\nwithout essentially changing the general features of the system, secure to\r\nthe greatest practicable extent its benefits to those who have left their\r\nhomes in the defense of the country in this arduous crisis.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the views of the Secretary as to the propriety\r\nof raising by appropriate legislation a revenue from the mineral lands of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe measures provided at your last session for the removal of certain\r\nIndian tribes have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been\r\nnegotiated, which will in due time be submitted for the constitutional\r\naction of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the\r\npossessory rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of lands.\r\nIt is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in the\r\nestablishment of permanent friendly relations with such of these tribes\r\nas have been brought into frequent and bloody collision with our outlying\r\nsettlements and emigrants. Sound policy and our imperative duty to these\r\nwards of the Government demand our anxious and constant attention to their\r\nmaterial well-being, to their progress in the arts of civilization, and,\r\nabove all, to that moral training which under the blessing of Divine\r\nProvidence will confer upon them the elevated and sanctifying influences,\r\nthe hopes and consolations, of the Christian faith.\r\n\r\nI suggested in my last annual message the propriety of remodeling our\r\nIndian system. Subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity. The\r\ndetails set forth in the report of the Secretary evince the urgent need\r\nfor immediate legislative action.\r\n\r\nI commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the\r\nGovernment in this District to your generous and fostering care.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress during the last session was engaged to some\r\nextent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between\r\nthe Mississippi River and the northeastern seaboard, which proposition,\r\nhowever, failed for the time. Since then, upon a call of the greatest\r\nrespectability, a convention has been held at Chicago upon the same\r\nsubject, a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to\r\nthe President and Congress, and which I now have the honor to lay before\r\nyou. That this interest is one which ere long will force its own way I do\r\nnot entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to\r\nwhat can be done now. Augmented interest is given to this subject by the\r\nactual commencement of work upon the Pacific Railroad, under auspices\r\nso favorable to rapid progress and completion. The enlarged navigation\r\nbecomes a palpable need to the great road.\r\n\r\nI transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the Department\r\nof Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in that vital\r\ninterest of the nation.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress assembled a year ago, the war had already lasted nearly\r\ntwenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea,\r\nwith varying results; the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced\r\nlimits; yet the tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad,\r\nwas not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections then just\r\npast indicated uneasiness among ourselves, while, amid much that was cold\r\nand menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accents\r\nof pity that we are too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Our commerce\r\nwas suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from\r\nforeign shores, and we were threatened with such additions from the same\r\nquarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade. We\r\nhad failed to elicit from European governments anything hopeful upon this\r\nsubject. The preliminary emancipation proclamation, issued in September,\r\nwas running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year. A month\r\nlater the final proclamation came, including the announcement that colored\r\nmen of suitable condition would be received into the war service. The\r\npolicy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future\r\na new aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain\r\nconflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil\r\nadministration, the General Government had no lawful power to effect\r\nemancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that\r\nthe rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military\r\nmeasure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it\r\nmight come, and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be\r\npresented. It came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and\r\ndoubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take\r\nanother review. The rebel borders are pressed still farther back, and\r\nby the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated by the\r\nrebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practical communication\r\nbetween them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been substantially cleared of\r\ninsurgent control, and influential citizens in each, owners of slaves and\r\nadvocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly\r\nfor emancipation in their respective States. Of those States not included\r\nin the emancipation proclamation, Maryland and Missouri, neither of which\r\nthree years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery\r\ninto new Territories, dispute now only as to the best mode of removing it\r\nwithin their own limits.\r\n\r\nOf those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100,000\r\nare now in the United States military service, about one-half of which\r\nnumber actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double advantage\r\nof taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the places\r\nwhich otherwise must be filled with so many white men. So far as tested,\r\nit is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any. No servile\r\ninsurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures\r\nof emancipation and arming the blacks. These measures have been much\r\ndiscussed in foreign countries, and, contemporary with such discussion,\r\nthe tone of public sentiment there is much improved. At home the same\r\nmeasures have been fully discussed, supported, criticized, and denounced,\r\nand the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose\r\nofficial duty it is to bear the country through this great trial. Thus we\r\nhave the new reckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide the friends\r\nof the Union is past.\r\n\r\nLooking now to the present and future, and with reference to a resumption\r\nof the national authority within the States wherein that authority has\r\nbeen suspended, I have thought fit to issue a proclamation, a copy of\r\nwhich is herewith transmitted. On examination of this proclamation it\r\nwill appear, as is believed, that nothing will be attempted beyond what is\r\namply justified by the Constitution. True, the form of an oath is given,\r\nbut no man is coerced to take it. The man is promised a pardon only\r\nin case he voluntarily takes the oath. The Constitution authorizes the\r\nExecutive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion,\r\nand this includes the power to grant on terms, as is fully established by\r\njudicial and other authorities.\r\n\r\nIt is also proffered that if in any of the States named a State government\r\nshall be in the mode prescribed set up, such government shall be\r\nrecognized and guaranteed by the United States, and that under it the\r\nState shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected against\r\ninvasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation of the\r\nUnited States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form\r\nof government and to protect the State in the cases stated is explicit\r\nand full. But why tender the benefits of this provision only to a State\r\ngovernment set up in this particular way? This section of the Constitution\r\ncontemplates a case wherein the element within a State favorable to\r\nrepublican government in the Union may be too feeble for an opposite\r\nand hostile element external to or even within the State, and such are\r\nprecisely the cases with which we are now dealing.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State government,\r\nconstructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element\r\nagainst whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simply\r\nabsurd. There must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements,\r\nso as to build only from the sound; and that test is a sufficiently\r\nliberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation\r\nof his former unsoundness.\r\n\r\nBut if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political\r\nbody an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and\r\nto the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to\r\nslavery? Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the\r\npurpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them their\r\nfullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. In my\r\njudgment, they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they\r\nwere intended. To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever\r\nof power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith. I\r\nmay add at this point that while I remain in my present position I shall\r\nnot attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor\r\nshall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that\r\nproclamation or by any of the acts of Congress. For these and other\r\nreasons it is thought best that support of these measures shall be\r\nincluded in the oath, and it is believed the Executive may lawfully claim\r\nit in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights, which he has\r\nclear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the terms\r\nwhich he shall deem wisest for the public interest. It should be observed\r\nalso that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating\r\npower of legislation and supreme judicial decision.\r\n\r\nThe proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any reasonable\r\ntemporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the view of\r\npossibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend\r\nall classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole States. It\r\nis hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those States may be\r\nsomewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction if to this\r\nextent this vital matter be left to themselves, while no power of the\r\nNational Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political\r\nframework of the States on what is called reconstruction is made in the\r\nhope that it may do good without danger of harm. It will save labor and\r\navoid great confusion.\r\n\r\nBut why any proclamation now upon this subject? This question is beset\r\nwith the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be\r\ntaken too soon. In some States the elements for resumption seem ready for\r\naction, but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying point--a\r\nplan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B rather than B that of\r\nA? And if A and B should agree, how can they know but that the General\r\nGovernment here will reject their plan? By the proclamation a plan is\r\npresented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which\r\nthey are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This may bring them\r\nto act sooner than they otherwise would.\r\n\r\nThe objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the National\r\nExecutive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be\r\nmore safely left to further developments. Care has been taken to so shape\r\nthe document as to avoid embarrassments from this source. Saying that on\r\ncertain terms certain classes will be pardoned with rights restored, it is\r\nnot said that other classes or other terms will never be included. Saying\r\nthat reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specified way, it\r\nis not said it will never be accepted in any other way.\r\n\r\nThe movements by State action for emancipation in several of the States\r\nnot included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profound\r\ngratulation. And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore\r\nso earnestly urged upon this subject my general views and feelings remain\r\nunchanged and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of\r\naiding these important steps to a great consummation.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of other cares, however important we must not lose sight\r\nof the fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that power\r\nalone we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the\r\ncontested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them.\r\nUntil that confidence shall be established little can be done anywhere\r\nwhat is called reconstruction. Hence our chiefest care must still be\r\ndirected to the Army and Navy who have thus far borne their harder part so\r\nnobly and well; and it may be esteemed fortunate that giving the greatest\r\nefficiency to these indispensable arms we do also honorably recognize the\r\ngallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose them, and to whom\r\nmore than to others the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom\r\ndisenthralled, regenerated, enlarged, and perpetuated.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. WASHINGTON D. C., December 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Captain John Rogers United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks\r\nfrom Congress for the eminent skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the\r\nengagement with the rebel armed ironclad steamer Fingal, alias Atlanta,\r\nwhilst in command of the United States ironclad steamer Weehawken, which\r\nled to her capture on the 17th June, 1863, and also for the zeal, bravery,\r\nand general good conduct shown by this officer on many occasions.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the\r\nrequirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the\r\nfollowing words, viz:\r\n\r\nThat any line officer of the Navy or Marine Corps may be advanced one\r\ngrade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the\r\nthanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the\r\nenemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE. WASHINGTON, D. C., December 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nCongress, on my recommendation, passed a resolution, approved 7th\r\nFebruary, 1863, tendering its thanks to Commander D. D. Porter \"for the\r\nbravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas on the\r\n10th January, 1863,\" and in consideration of those services, together with\r\nhis efficient labors and vigilance subsequently displayed in thwarting the\r\nefforts of the rebels to obstruct the Mississippi and its tributaries and\r\nthe important part rendered by the squadron under his command, which led\r\nto the surrender of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nI do therefore, in conformity to the seventh section of the act approved\r\n16th July, 1862, nominate Commander D. D. Porter to be a rear-admiral in\r\nthe Navy on the active list from the 4th July, 1863, to fill an existing\r\nvacancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that your lodgment at Chattanooga and Knoxville is now\r\nsecure, I wish to tender you, and all under your command, my more than\r\nthanks, my profoundest gratitude, for the skill, courage, and perseverance\r\nwith which you and they, over so great difficulties, have effected that\r\nimportant object. God bless you all!\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 9, 1863\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY A. G. CURTIN,\r\n\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I have to urge my illness, and the preparation of the message,\r\nin excuse for not having sooner transmitted you the inclosed from the\r\nSecretary of War and Provost Marshal General in response to yours in\r\nrelation to recruiting in Pennsylvania. Though not quite as you desire, I\r\nhope the grounds taken will be reasonably satisfactory to you. Allow me\r\nto exchange congratulations with you on the organization of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and especially on recent military events in Georgia and\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nPlease suspend execution in any and all sentences of death in your\r\ndepartment until further order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nLieut. Col. James B. Knox, Tenth Regiment Pennsylvania Reserves, offers\r\nhis resignation under circumstances inducing me to wish to accept it. But\r\nI prefer to know your pleasure upon the subject. Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE HOFFMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, December 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. OGDEN HOFFMAN, U. S. District Judge, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nThe oath in the proclamation of December 8 is intended for those who may\r\nvoluntarily take it, and not for those who may be constrained to take it\r\nin order to escape actual imprisonment or punishment. It is intended that\r\nthe latter class shall abide the granting or withholding of the pardoning\r\npower in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MARY GONYEAG.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nMOTHER MARY GONYEAG, Superior, Academy of Visitation, Keokuk, Iowa:\r\n\r\nThe President has no authority as to whether you may raffle for the\r\nbenevolent object you mention. If there is no objection in the Iowa laws,\r\nthere is none here.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING DISCRIMINATING DUTIES, DECEMBER 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th of May,\r\n1828, entitled \"An act in addition to an act entitled 'An act concerning\r\ndiscriminating duties of tonnage and impost' and to equalize the duties on\r\nPrussian vessels and their cargoes,\" it is provided that upon satisfactory\r\nevidence being given to the President of the United States by the\r\ngovernment of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of tonnage\r\nor impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation upon\r\nvessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the\r\nproduce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United\r\nStates or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to\r\nissue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of\r\ntonnage and impost within the United States are and shall be suspended and\r\ndiscontinued so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation and\r\nthe produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United\r\nStates in the same from the said foreign nation or from any other\r\nforeign country, the said suspension to take effect from the time of such\r\nnotification being given to the President of the United States and to\r\ncontinue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to\r\ncitizens of the United States and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be\r\ncontinued, and no longer; and\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me through an\r\nofficial communication of Senor Don Luis Molina, Envoy Extraordinary and\r\nMinister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Nicaragua, under date of the\r\n28th of November, 1863, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and\r\nimpost have been imposed or levied since the second day of August, 1838,\r\nin the ports of Nicaragua, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of\r\nthe United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise\r\nimported in the same from the United States, and from any foreign country\r\nwhatever, than are levied on Nicaraguan ships and their cargoes in the\r\nsame ports under like circumstances:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several acts\r\nimposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United\r\nStates are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as respects\r\nthe vessels of Nicaragua, and the produce, manufactures, and the\r\nmerchandise imported into the United States in the same from the dominions\r\nof Nicaragua, and from any other foreign country whatever; the said\r\nsuspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue\r\nthenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the\r\nUnited States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported\r\ninto the dominions of Nicaragua in the same, as aforesaid, shall be\r\ncontinued on the part of the government of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand at the city of Washington, the sixteenth day\r\nof December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and\r\nsixty-three, and the eighty-eighth of the Independence of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nHerewith I lay before you a letter addressed to myself by a committee of\r\ngentlemen representing the freedmen's aid societies in Boston, New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Cincinnati. The subject of the letter, as indicated\r\nabove, is one of great magnitude and importance, and one which these\r\ngentlemen, of known ability and high character, seem to have considered\r\nwith great attention and care. Not having the time to form a mature\r\njudgment of my own as to whether the plan they suggest is the best, I\r\nsubmit the whole subject to Congress, deeming that their attention thereto\r\nis almost imperatively demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HURLBUT.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.

I personally knew him, and did not think him a bad\r\nman. Please do not let him be executed unless upon further order from me,\r\nand in the meantime send me a transcript of the record.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, December 19, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL GRANT, Chattanooga, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nThe Indiana delegation in Congress, or at least a large part of them, are\r\nvery anxious that General Milroy shall enter active service again, and I\r\nshare in this feeling. He is not a difficult man to satisfy, sincerity and\r\ncourage being his strong traits. Believing in our cause, and wanting\r\nto fight for it, is the whole matter with him. Could you, without\r\nembarrassment, assign him a place, if directed to report to you?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Sending a note to the Secretary of the Navy, as I promised,\r\nhe called over and said that the strikes in the ship-yards had thrown\r\nthe completion of vessels back so much that he thought General Gilimore's\r\nproposition entirely proper. He only wishes (and in which I concur) that\r\nGeneral Gillmore will courteously confer with, and explain to, Admiral\r\nDahlgren.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Western matter, I believe the program will have to stand\r\nsubstantially as I first put it. Henderson, and especially Brown, believe\r\nthat the social influence of St. Louis would inevitably tell injuriously\r\nupon General Pope in the particular difficulty existing there, and I think\r\nthere is some force in that view.\r\n\r\nAs to retaining General Schofield temporarily, if this should be done,\r\nI believe I should scarcely be able to get his nomination through the\r\nSenate. Send me over his nomination, which, however, I am not quite ready\r\nto send to the Senate.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO O. D. FILLEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nO. D. FILLEY, ST. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nI have just looked over a petition signed by some three dozen citizens of\r\nSt. Louis, and three accompanying letters, one by yourself, one by a Mr.\r\nNathan Ranney, and one by a Mr. John D. Coalter, the whole relating to the\r\nRev. Dr. McPheeters. The petition prays, in the name of justice and mercy,\r\nthat I will restore Dr. McPheeters to all his ecclesiastical rights. This\r\ngives no intimation as to what ecclesiastical rights are withheld.\r\n\r\nYour letter states that Provost-Marshal Dick, about a year ago, ordered\r\nthe arrest of Dr. McPheeters, pastor of the Vine Street Church, prohibited\r\nhim from officiating, and placed the management of the affairs of the\r\nchurch out of the control of its chosen trustees; and near the close\r\nyou state that a certain course \"would insure his release.\" Mr. Ranney's\r\nletter says: \"Dr. Samuel S. McPheeters is enjoying all the rights of a\r\ncivilian, but cannot preach the Gospel!!!!\" Mr. Coalter, in his letter,\r\nasks: \"Is it not a strange illustration of the condition of things, that\r\nthe question of who shall be allowed to preach in a church in St. Louis\r\nshall be decided by the President of the United States?\"\r\n\r\nNow, all this sounds very strangely; and, withal, a little as if you\r\ngentlemen making the application do not understand the case alike; one\r\naffirming that the doctor is enjoying all the rights of a civilian, and\r\nanother pointing out to me what will secure his release! On the second day\r\nof January last, I wrote to General Curtis in relation to Mr. Dick's order\r\nupon Dr. McPheeters; and, as I suppose the doctor is enjoying all the\r\nrights of a civilian, I only quote that part of my letter which relates\r\nto the church. It is as follows: \"But I must add that the United States\r\nGovernment must not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches. When\r\nan individual, in a church or out of it, becomes dangerous to the public\r\ninterest, he must be checked; but the churches, as such, must take care\r\nof themselves. It will not do for the United States to appoint trustees,\r\nsupervisors, or other agents for the churches.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter going to General Curtis, then in command there, I supposed, of\r\ncourse, it was obeyed, especially as I heard no further complaint from\r\nDr. McPheeters or his friends for nearly an entire year. I have never\r\ninterfered, nor thought of interfering, as to who shall or shall not\r\npreach in any church; nor have I knowingly or believingly tolerated any\r\none else to so interfere by my authority. If any one is so interfering by\r\ncolor of my authority, I would like to have it specifically made known\r\nto me. If, after all, what is now sought is to have me put Dr. McPheeters\r\nback over the heads of a majority of his own congregation, that, too, will\r\nbe declined. I will not have control of any church on any side.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MILITARY COMMANDER AT POINT LOOKOUT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nMILITARY COMMANDER, Point Lookout, Md.:\r\n\r\nIf you have a prisoner by the name Linder--Daniel Linder, I think, and\r\ncertainly the son of U.

I intend you to be master in every controversy\r\nmade with you.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., December 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nJacob Bowers is fully pardoned for past offence, upon condition that he\r\nreturns to duty and re-enlists for three years or during the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, December 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Please fix up the department to which Curtis is to go, without\r\nwaiting to wind up the Missouri matter. Lane is very anxious to have Fort\r\nSmith in it, and I am willing, unless there be decided military reasons to\r\nthe contrary, in which case of course, I am not for it. It will oblige me\r\nto have the Curtis department fixed at once.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR PIERPOINT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., January 2, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR PIERPOINT, Alexandria, Va.:\r\n\r\nPlease call and see me to-day if not too inconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 2, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The Secretary of War and myself have concluded to discharge of the\r\nprisoners at Point Lookout the following classes: First, those who will\r\ntake the oath prescribed in the proclamation of December 8, and issued by\r\nthe consent of General Marston, will enlist in our service. Second, those\r\nwho will take the oath and be discharged and whose homes lie safely within\r\nour military lines.\r\n\r\nI send by Mr. Hay this letter and a blank-book and some other blanks, the\r\nway of using which I propose for him to explain verbally better than I can\r\nin writing.\r\n\r\nYours, very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE:\r\n\r\nIf not inconsistent with the service, please allow General William Harrow\r\nas long a leave of absence as the rules permit with the understanding that\r\nI may lengthen it if I see fit. He is an acquaintance and friend of mine,\r\nand his family matters very urgently require his presence.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS,\r\n\r\nJANUARY 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nBy a joint resolution of your honorable bodies approved December 23, 1863,\r\nthe paying of bounties to veteran volunteers, as now practiced by the\r\nWar Department, is, to the extent of three hundred dollars in each case,\r\nprohibited after this 5th day of the present month. I transmit for your\r\nconsideration a communication from the Secretary of War, accompanied by\r\none from the Provost-Marshal General to him, both relating to the subject\r\nabove mentioned. I earnestly recommend that the law be so modified as to\r\nallow bounties to be paid as they now are, at least until the ensuing 1st\r\nday of February.\r\n\r\nI am not without anxiety lest I appear to be importunate in thus recalling\r\nyour attention to a subject upon which you have so recently acted, and\r\nnothing but a deep conviction that the public interest demands it could\r\ninduce me to incur the hazard of being misunderstood on this point. The\r\nExecutive approval was given by me to the resolution mentioned, and it\r\nis now by a closer attention and a fuller knowledge of facts that I feel\r\nconstrained to recommend a reconsideration of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BRAMLETTE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 6, 1864. 2 P.M.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR BRAMLETTE, Frankfort, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday received. Nothing is known here about General Foster's\r\norder, of which you complain, beyond the fair presumption that it comes\r\nfrom General Grant, and that it has an object which, if you understood,\r\nyou would be loath to frustrate. True, these troops are, in strict law,\r\nonly to be removed by my order; but General Grant's judgment would be the\r\nhighest incentive to me to make such order. Nor can I understand how doing\r\nso is bad faith and dishonor, nor yet how it so exposes Kentucky to ruin.\r\nMilitary men here do not perceive how it exposes Kentucky, and I am sure\r\nGrant would not permit it if it so appeared to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL Q. A. GILLMORE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 13, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GILLMORE:\r\n\r\nI understand an effort is being made by some worthy gentlemen to\r\nreconstruct a legal State government in Florida. Florida is in your\r\nDepartment, and it is not unlikely you may be there in person. I have\r\ngiven Mr. Hay a commission of major, and sent him to you, with some\r\nblank-books and other blanks, to aid in the reconstruction. He will\r\nexplain as to the manner of using the blanks, and also my general views on\r\nthe subject. It is desirable for all to co-operate, but if irreconcilable\r\ndifferences of opinion shall arise, you are master. I wish the thing done\r\nin the most speedy way, so that when done it be within the range of the\r\nlate proclamation on the subject. The detail labor will, of course, have\r\nto be done by others; but I will be greatly obliged if you will give\r\nit such general supervision as you can find consistent with your more\r\nstrictly military duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BROUGH. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 15,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR BROUGH, Columbus, Ohio:\r\n\r\nIf Private William G. Toles, of Fifty-ninth Ohio Volunteers, returns to\r\nhis regiment and faithfully serves out his term, he is fully pardoned for\r\nall military offenses prior to this.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CROSBY AND NICHOLS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. CROSBY AND NICHOLS.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: The number for this month and year of the North American Review\r\nwas duly received, and for which please accept my thanks. Of course I am\r\nnot the most impartial judge; yet, with due allowance for this, I venture\r\nto hope that the article entitled \"The President's Policy\" will be of\r\nvalue to the country. I fear I am not worthy of all which is therein\r\nkindly said of me personally.\r\n\r\nThe sentence of twelve lines, commencing at the top of page 252, I could\r\nwish to be not exactly what it is. In what is there expressed, the writer\r\nhas not correctly understood me. I have never had a theory that secession\r\ncould absolve States or people from their obligations. Precisely the\r\ncontrary is asserted in the inaugural address; and it was because of my\r\nbelief in the continuation of those obligations that I was puzzled, for\r\na time, as to denying the legal rights of those citizens who remained\r\nindividually innocent of treason or rebellion. But I mean no more now than\r\nto merely call attention to this point.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL P. STEELE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL STEELE:\r\n\r\nSundry citizens of the State of Arkansas petition me that an election may\r\nbe held in that State, at which to elect a Governor; that it be assumed\r\nat that election, and thenceforward, that the constitution and laws of\r\nthe State, as before the rebellion, are in full force, except that the\r\nconstitution is so modified as to declare that there shall be neither\r\nslavery nor involuntary servitude, except in the punishment of crimes\r\nwhereof the party shall have been duly convicted; that the General\r\nAssembly may make such provisions for the freed people as shall recognize\r\nand declare their permanent freedom, and provide for their education, and\r\nwhich may yet be construed as a temporary arrangement suitable to their\r\ncondition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class; that said election\r\nshall be held on the 28th of March, 1864, at all the usual places of the\r\nState, or all such as voters may attend for that purpose, that the voters\r\nattending at eight o'clock in the morning of said day may choose judges\r\nand clerks of election for such purpose; that all persons qualified\r\nby said constitution and laws, and taking the oath presented in the\r\nPresident's proclamation of December 8, 1863, either before or at the\r\nelection, and none others, may be voters; that each set of judges and\r\nclerks may make returns directly to you on or before the --th day of ----\r\nnext; that in all other respects said election may be conducted according\r\nto said constitution and laws: that on receipt of said returns, when five\r\nthousand four hundred and six votes shall have been cast, you can receive\r\nsaid votes, and ascertain all who shall thereby appear to have been\r\nelected; that on the --th day of ------ next, all persons so appearing to\r\nhave been elected, who shall appear before you at Little Rock, and take\r\nthe oath, to be by you severally administered, to support the Constitution\r\nof the United States and said modified Constitution of the State of\r\nArkansas, may be declared by you qualified and empowered to enter\r\nimmediately upon the duties of the offices to which they shall have been\r\nrespectively elected.\r\n\r\nYou will please order an election to take place on the 28th of March,\r\n1864, and returns to be made in fifteen days thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS, JANUARY 20, 1864\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with a letter addressed by the Secretary of State, with my\r\napproval, to the Hon. Joseph A. Wright, of Indiana, that patriotic and\r\ndistinguished gentleman repaired to Europe and attended the International\r\nAgricultural Exhibition, held at Hamburg last year, and has since his\r\nreturn made a report to me, which, it is believed, can not fail to be\r\nof general interest, and especially so to the agricultural community. I\r\ntransmit for your consideration copies of the letters and report. While\r\nit appears by the letter that no reimbursement of expenses or compensation\r\nwas promised him, I submit whether reasonable allowance should not be made\r\nhim for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER APPROVING TRADE REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States having seen and\r\nconsidered the additional regulations of trade prescribed by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, and numbered LI, LII, LIII, LIV, LV, and LVI, do hereby\r\napprove the same; and I further declare and order that all property\r\nbrought in for sale, in good faith, and actually sold in pursuance of said\r\nRegulations LII, LIII, LIV, LV, and LVI, after the same shall have taken\r\neffect and come in force as provided in Regulation LVI, shall be exempt\r\nfrom confiscation or forfeiture to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

C., January 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FOSTER, Knoxville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nIs a supposed correspondence between General Longstreet and yourself about\r\nthe amnesty proclamation, which is now in the newspapers, genuine?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO E. STANLEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 28, 1864\r\n\r\nHON. EDWARD STANLEY, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday received. We have rumors similar to the dispatch\r\nreceived by you, but nothing very definite from North Carolina. Knowing\r\nMr. Stanley to be an able man, and not doubting that he is a patriot, I\r\nshould be glad for him to be with his old acquaintances south of Virginia,\r\nbut I am unable to suggest anything definite upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nSome citizens of Missouri, vicinity of Kansas City, are apprehensive that\r\nthere is special danger of renewed troubles in that neighborhood, and\r\nthence on the route toward New Mexico. I am not impressed that the danger\r\nis very great or imminent, but I will thank you to give Generals Rosecrans\r\nand Curtis, respectively, such orders as may turn their attention thereto\r\nand prevent as far as possible the apprehended disturbance.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SICKLES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SICKLES, New York:\r\n\r\nCould you, without it being inconvenient or disagreeable to yourself,\r\nimmediately take a trip to Arkansas for me?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BRAMLETTE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.

STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nSIR:-You are directed to have a transport (either a steam or sailing\r\nvessel, as may be deemed proper by the Quartermaster-General) sent to the\r\ncolored colony established by the United States at the island of Vache,\r\non the coast of San Domingo, to bring back to this country such of the\r\ncolonists there as desire to return. You will have the transport furnished\r\nwith suitable supplies for that purpose, and detail an officer of the\r\nQuartermaster's Department, who, under special instructions to be given,\r\nshall have charge of the business. The colonists will be brought to\r\nWashington, unless otherwise hereafter directed, and be employed and\r\nprovided for at the camps for colored persons around that city. Those only\r\nwill be brought from the island who desire to return, and their effects\r\nwill be brought with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER FOR A DRAFT OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 1, 1864.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That a draft of five hundred thousand (500,000) men, to serve for\r\nthree years or during the war, be made on the tenth (10th) day of March\r\nnext, for the military service of the United States, crediting and\r\ndeducting therefrom so many as may have been enlisted or drafted into the\r\nservice prior to the first (1st) day of March, and not before credited.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR MURPHY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR J. MURPHY:\r\n\r\nMy order to General Steele about an election was made in ignorance of\r\nthe action your convention had taken or would take. A subsequent letter\r\ndirects General Steele to aid you on your own plan, and not to thwart or\r\nhinder you. Show this to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\nTOLD BY THE PRESIDENT, TO THE ARTIST F. B. CARPENTER,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 6, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"It had got to be,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"midsummer, 1862. Things had gone on\r\nfrom bad to worse, until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on\r\nthe plan of operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played our\r\nlast card, and must change our tactics, or lose the game. I now determined\r\nupon the adoption of the emancipation policy; and without consultation\r\nwith, or the knowledge of, the Cabinet, I prepared the original draft\r\nof the proclamation, and, after much anxious thought, called a Cabinet\r\nmeeting upon the subject. This was the last of July or the first part of\r\nthe month of August, 1862. [The exact date was July 22, 1862.]... All were\r\npresent excepting Mr. Blair, the Postmaster-General, who was absent at the\r\nopening of the discussion, but came in subsequently. I said to the Cabinet\r\nthat I had resolved upon this step, and had not called them together to\r\nask their advice, but to lay the subject-matter of a proclamation before\r\nthem, suggestions as to which would be in order after they had heard it\r\nread. Mr. Lovejoy was in error when he informed you that it excited no\r\ncomment excepting on the part of Secretary Seward. Various suggestions\r\nwere offered. Secretary Chase wished the language stronger in reference to\r\nthe arming of the blacks.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blair, after he came in, deprecated the policy on the ground that it\r\nwould cost the administration the fall elections. Nothing, however, was\r\noffered that I had not already fully anticipated and settled in my mind,\r\nuntil Secretary Seward spoke. He said in substance, 'Mr. President, I\r\napprove of the proclamation, but I question the expediency of its issue\r\nat this juncture. The depression of the public mind, consequent upon our\r\nrepeated reverses, is so great that I fear the effect of so important a\r\nstep. It may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted government,\r\na cry for help; the government stretching forth its hands to Ethiopia,\r\ninstead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the government.' His\r\nidea,\" said the President, \"was that it would be considered our last\r\nshriek on the retreat.\" [This was his precise expression.] 'Now,'\r\ncontinued Mr. Seward, 'while I approve the measure, I suggest, sir, that\r\nyou postpone its issue until you can give it to the country supported by\r\nmilitary success, instead of issuing it, as would be the case now, upon\r\nthe greatest disasters of the war.' Mr. Lincoln continued \"The wisdom of\r\nthe view of the Secretary of State struck me with very great force. It\r\nwas an aspect of the case that, in all my thought upon the subject, I\r\nhad entirely overlooked. The result was that I put the draft of the\r\nproclamation aside, as you do your sketch for a picture, waiting for a\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n\"From time to time I added or changed a line, touching it up here and\r\nthere, anxiously watching the process of events. Well, the next news we\r\nhad was of Pope's disaster at Bull Run. Things looked darker than ever.\r\nFinally came the week of the battle of Antietam. I determined to wait no\r\nlonger. The news came, I think, on Wednesday, that the advantage was on\r\nour side. I was then staying at the Soldiers' Home [three miles out of\r\nWashington]. Here I finished writing the second draft of the preliminary\r\nproclamation; came up on Saturday; called the Cabinet together to hear it,\r\nand it was published on the following Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SEDGWICK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 11, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SEDGWICK, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nUnless there be some strong reason to the contrary, please send General\r\nKilpatrick to us here, for two or three days.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO HORACE MAYNARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 13, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. HORACE MAYNARD, Nashville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYour letter of [the] second received. Of course Governor Johnson will\r\nproceed with reorganization as the exigencies of the case appear to him to\r\nrequire. I do not apprehend he will think it necessary to deviate from my\r\nviews to any ruinous extent. On one hasty reading I see no such deviation\r\nin his program, which you send.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

FISHBACK, Little Rock, Arkansas:\r\n\r\nWhen I fixed a plan for an election in Arkansas I did it in ignorance that\r\nyour convention was doing the same work. Since I learned the latter fact\r\nI have been constantly trying to yield my plan to them. I have sent two\r\nletters to General Steele, and three or four despatches to you and others,\r\nsaying that he, General Steele, must be master, but that it will probably\r\nbe best for him to merely help the convention on its own plan. Some single\r\nmind must be master, else there will be no agreement in anything, and\r\nGeneral Steele, commanding the military and being on the ground, is the\r\nbest man to be that master. Even now citizens are telegraphing me to\r\npostpone the election to a later day than either that fixed by the\r\nconvention or by me. This discord must be silenced.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL STEELE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL STEELE, Little Rock, Arkansas:\r\n\r\nThe day fixed by the convention for the election is probably the best,\r\nbut you on the ground, and in consultation with gentlemen there, are to\r\ndecide. I should have fixed no day for an election, presented no plan for\r\nreconstruction, had I known the convention was doing the same things. It\r\nis probably best that you merely assist the convention on their own\r\nplan, as to election day and all other matters I have already written and\r\ntelegraphed this half a dozen times.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO A. ROBINSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nA. ROBINSON, Leroy, N. Y.:\r\n\r\nThe law only obliges us to keep accounts with States, or at most\r\nCongressional Districts, and it would overwhelm us to attempt in counties,\r\ncities and towns. Nevertheless we do what we can to oblige in particular\r\ncases. In this view I send your dispatch to the Provost-Marshal General,\r\nasking him to do the best he can for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING BLOCKADE, FEBRUARY 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, by my proclamation of the nineteenth of April, one thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-one, the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia,\r\nAlabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas were, for reasons\r\ntherein set forth, placed under blockade; and whereas, the port of\r\nBrownsville, in the district of Brazos Santiago, in the State of Texas,\r\nhas since been blockaded, but as the blockade of said port may now be\r\nsafely relaxed with advantage to the interests of commerce:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section\r\nof the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled \"An\r\nact further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for\r\nother purposes,\" do hereby declare that the blockade of the said port of\r\nBrownsville shall so far cease and determine from and after this date,\r\nthat commercial intercourse with said port, except as to persons, things,\r\nand information hereinafter specified, may, from this date, be carried on,\r\nsubject to the laws of the United States, to the regulations prescribed\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury, and, until the rebellion shall have been\r\nsuppressed, to such orders as may be promulgated by the general commanding\r\nthe department, or by an officer duly authorized by him and commanding at\r\nsaid port. This proclamation does not authorize or allow the shipment\r\nor conveyance of persons in, or intending to enter, the service of the\r\ninsurgents, or of things or information intended for their use, or for\r\ntheir aid or comfort, nor, except upon the permission of the Secretary\r\nof War, or of some officer duly authorized by him, of the following\r\nprohibited articles, namely: cannon, mortars, firearms, pistols, bombs,\r\ngrenades, powder, saltpeter, sulphur, balls, bullets, pikes, swords,\r\nboarding-caps (always excepting the quantity of the said articles which\r\nmay be necessary for the defense of the ship and those who compose the\r\ncrew), saddles, bridles, cartridge-bag material, percussion and other\r\ncaps, clothing adapted for uniforms; sail-cloth of all kinds, hemp and\r\ncordage, intoxicating drinks other than beer and light native wines.\r\n\r\nTo vessels clearing from foreign ports and destined to the port of\r\nBrownsville, opened by this proclamation, licenses will be granted by\r\nconsuls of the United States upon satisfactory evidence that the vessel\r\nso licensed will convey no persons, property, or information excepted or\r\nprohibited above, either to or from the said port; which licenses shall\r\nbe exhibited to the collector of said port immediately on arrival, and,\r\nif required, to any officer in charge of the blockade, and on leaving said\r\nport every vessel will be required to have a clearance from the collector\r\nof the customs, according to law, showing no violation of the conditions\r\nof the license. Any violations of said conditions will involve the\r\nforfeiture and condemnation of the vessel and cargo, and the exclusion of\r\nall parties concerned from any further privilege of entering the United\r\nStates during the war for any purpose whatever.\r\n\r\nIn all respects, except as herein specified, the existing blockade remains\r\nin full force and effect as hitherto established and maintained, nor is\r\nit relaxed by this proclamation except in regard to the port to which\r\nrelaxation is or has been expressly applied.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this\r\neighteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the\r\neighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

BLAKE, Commandant Naval Academy, Newport, R. I.:\r\n\r\nI desire the case of Midshipman C. Lyon re-examined and if not clearly\r\ninconsistent I shall be much obliged to have the recommendation changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM WARREN JORDAN.\r\n\r\nNASHVILLE, February 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State, Washington, D.C.:\r\n\r\nIn county and State elections, must citizens of Tennessee take the oath\r\nprescribed by Governor Johnson, or will the President's oath of amnesty\r\nentitle them to vote? I have been appointed to hold the March election in\r\nCheatham County, and wish to act understandingly.\r\n\r\nWARREN JORDAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nWARREN JORDAN, NASHVILLE:\r\n\r\nIn county elections you had better stand by Governor Johnson's plan;\r\notherwise you will have conflict and confusion. I have seen his plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., February 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Saint LOUIS, MO.:\r\n\r\nColonel Sanderson will be ordered to you to-day, a mere omission that it\r\nwas not done before. The other questions in your despatch I am not yet\r\nprepared to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL STEELE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

Let\r\nthe election be on the 14th of March as they agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL F. STEELE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, February 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL STEELE, Little Rock, Arkansas:\r\n\r\nGeneral Sickles is not going to Arkansas. He probably will make a tour\r\ndown the Mississippi and home by the gulf and ocean, but he will not\r\nmeddle in your affairs.\r\n\r\nAt one time I did intend to have him call on you and explain more fully\r\nthan I could do by letter or telegraph, so as to avoid a difficulty coming\r\nof my having made a plan here, while the convention made one there, for\r\nreorganizing Arkansas; but even his doing that has been given up for\r\nmore than two weeks. Please show this to Governor Murphy to save me\r\ntelegraphing him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESERTERS DEATH SENTENCES REMITTED\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, NO.76.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERALS OFFICE,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nSentence of Deserters.\r\n\r\nThe President directs that the sentences of all deserters who have been\r\ncondemned by court-martial to death, and that have not been otherwise\r\nacted upon by him, be mitigated to imprisonment during the war at the Dry\r\nTortugas, Florida, where they will be sent under suitable guards by orders\r\nfrom army commanders.\r\n\r\nThe commanding generals, who have power to act on proceedings of\r\ncourts-martial in such cases, are authorized in special cases to restore\r\nto duty deserters under sentence, when in their judgment the service will\r\nbe thereby benefited.\r\n\r\nCopies of all orders issued under the foregoing instructions will be\r\nimmediately forwarded to the Adjutant-General and to the Judge-Advocate\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War: B.

Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nI cannot remember at whose request it was that I gave the pass to Mrs.\r\nBulky. Of course detain her, if the evidence of her being a spy is strong\r\nagainst her.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. JAYNE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. W. JAYNE.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--I dislike to make changes in office so long as they can\r\nbe avoided. It multiplies my embarrassments immensely. I dislike two\r\nappointments when one will do. Send me the name of some man not the\r\npresent marshal, and I will nominate him to be Provost-Marshal for Dakota.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. H. EAST.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. E. H: EAST, Secretary of State, Nashville, Tennessee\r\n\r\nYour telegram of the twenty-sixth instant asking for a copy of my despatch\r\nto Warren Jordan, Esq., at Nashville Press office, has just been referred\r\nto me by Governor Johnson. In my reply to Mr. Jordan, which was brief\r\nand hurried, I intended to say that in the county and State elections of\r\nTennessee, the oath prescribed in the proclamation of Governor Johnson on\r\nthe twenty-sixth of January, 1864, ordering an election in Tennessee on\r\nthe first Saturday in March next, is entirely satisfactory to me as a test\r\nof loyalty of all persons proposing or offering to vote in said elections;\r\nand coming from him would better be observed and followed. There is\r\nno conflict between the oath of amnesty in my proclamation of eighth\r\nDecember, 1863, and that prescribed by Governor Johnson in his\r\nproclamation of the twenty-sixth ultimo.\r\n\r\nNo person who has taken the oath of amnesty of eighth December, 1863, and\r\nobtained a pardon thereby, and who intends to observe the same in good\r\nfaith, should have any objection to taking that prescribed by Governor\r\nJohnson as a test of loyalty.\r\n\r\nI have seen and examined Governor Johnson's proclamation, and am entirely\r\nsatisfied with his plan, which is to restore the State government and\r\nplace it under the control of citizens truly loyal to the Government of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nPlease send above to Governor Johnson. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 27, 1864\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR:--You ask some instructions from me in relation to the Report of\r\nSpecial Commission constituted by an order of the War Department, dated\r\nDecember 5, 1863, \"to revise the enrolment and quotas of the City and\r\nState of New York, and report whether there be any, and what, errors or\r\nirregularities therein, and what corrections, if any, should be made.\"\r\n\r\nIn the correspondence between the Governor of New York and myself last\r\nsummer, I understood him to complain that the enrolments in several of the\r\ndistricts of that State had been neither accurately nor honestly made;\r\nand in view of this, I, for the draft then immediately ensuing, ordered an\r\narbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the districts wherein they\r\nseemed too large, and said: \"After this drawing, these four districts,\r\nand also the seventeenth and twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled,\r\nand, if you please, agents of yours may witness every step of the\r\nprocess.\" In a subsequent letter I believe some additional districts were\r\nput into the list of those to be re-enrolled. My idea was to do the work\r\nover according to the law, in presence of the complaining party, and\r\nthereby to correct anything which might be found amiss. The commission,\r\nwhose work I am considering, seem to have proceeded upon a totally\r\ndifferent idea. Not going forth to find men at all, they have proceeded\r\naltogether upon paper examinations and mental processes. One of their\r\nconclusions, as I understand, is that, as the law stands, and attempting\r\nto follow it, the enrolling officers could not have made the enrolments\r\nmuch more accurately than they did. The report on this point might be\r\nuseful to Congress. The commission conclude that the quotas for the draft\r\nshould be based upon entire population, and they proceed upon this basis\r\nto give a table for the State of New York, in which some districts are\r\nreduced and some increased. For the now ensuing draft, let the quotas\r\nstand as made by the enrolling officers, in the districts wherein this\r\ntable requires them to be increased; and let them be reduced according to\r\nthe table in the others: this to be no precedent for subsequent action.\r\nBut, as I think this report may, on full consideration, be shown to have\r\nmuch that is valuable in it, I suggest that such consideration be given\r\nit, and that it be especially considered whether its suggestions can be\r\nconformed to without an alteration of the law.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL THOMAS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, February 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL L. THOMAS, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nI see your despatch of yesterday to the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nI wish you would go to the Mississippi River at once, and take hold of and\r\nbe master in the contraband and leasing business. You understand it better\r\nthan any other man does. Mr. Miller's system doubtless is well intended,\r\nbut from what I hear I fear that, if persisted in, it would fall dead\r\nwithin its own entangling details. Go there and be the judge. A Mr. Lewis\r\nwill probably follow you with something from me on this subject, but do\r\nnot wait for him. Nor is this to induce you to violate or neglect any\r\nmilitary order from the General-in-Chief or Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CHASE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I would have taken time to answer yours of the 22d inst.\r\nsooner, only that I did not suppose any evil could result from the delay,\r\nespecially as, by a note, I promptly acknowledged the receipt of yours,\r\nand promised a fuller answer. Now, on consideration I find there is really\r\nvery little to say. My knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy's letter having been made\r\npublic came to me only the day you wrote; but I had, in spite of myself,\r\nknown of its existence several days before. I have not yet read it, and I\r\nthink I shall not. I was not shocked or surprised by the appearance of\r\nthe letter, because I had had knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy's committee, and of\r\nsecret issues which, I supposed, came from it, and of secret agents who,\r\nI supposed, were sent out by it for several weeks. I have known just as\r\nlittle a these things as my friends have allowed me to know. They bring\r\nthe documents to me, but I do not read them; they tell me what they think\r\nfit to tell me, but I do not inquire for more.\r\n\r\nI fully concur with you that neither of us can justly be held responsible\r\nfor what our respective friends may do without our instigation or\r\ncountenance and I assure you, as you have assured me, that no assault has\r\nbeen made upon you by my instigation, or with my countenance.\r\n\r\nWhether you shall remain at the head of the Treasury Department is a\r\nquestion which I will not allow myself to consider from any standpoint\r\nother than my judgment of the public service, and, in that view, I do not\r\nperceive occasion for a change.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL THOMAS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, March 1,1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL L. THOMAS:\r\n\r\nThis introduces Mr. Lewis, mentioned in my despatch sent you at Louisville\r\nsome days ago. I have but little personal acquaintance with him; but he\r\nhas the confidence of several members of Congress here who seem to know\r\nhim well. He hopes to be useful, without charge to the government, in\r\nfacilitating the introduction of the free-labor system on the Mississippi\r\nplantations. He is acquainted with, and has access to, many of the\r\nplanters who wish to adopt the system. He will show you two letters of\r\nmine on this subject, one somewhat General, and the other relating to\r\nnamed persons; they are not different in principle. He will also show you\r\nsome suggestions coming from some of the planters themselves. I desire\r\nthat all I promise in these letters, so far as practicable, may be in good\r\nfaith carried out, and that suggestions from the planters may be heard\r\nand adopted, so far as they may not contravene the principles stated, nor\r\njustice, nor fairness, to laborers. I do not herein intend to overrule\r\nyour own mature judgment on any point.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL STEELE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., March 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL STEELE, Little Rock, Ark.:\r\n\r\nYours including address to people of Arkansas is received. I approve the\r\naddress and thank you for it. Yours in relation to William M. Randolph\r\nalso received. Let him take the oath of December 8, and go to work for the\r\nnew constitution, and on your notifying me of it, I will immediately issue\r\nthe special pardon for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO SENATE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, March 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 1st instant,\r\nrespecting the points of commencement of the Union Pacific Railroad, on\r\nthe one hundredth degree of west longitude, and of the branch road,\r\nfrom the western boundary of Iowa to the said one hundredth degree of\r\nlongitude, I transmit the accompanying report from the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, containing the information called for.\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to add that on the 17th day of November last an Executive\r\norder was made upon this subject and delivered to the vice-president of\r\nthe Union Pacific Railroad Company, which fixed the point on the western\r\nboundary of the State of Iowa from which the company should construct\r\ntheir branch road to the one hundredth degree of west longitude, and\r\ndeclared it to be within the limits of the township in Iowa opposite the\r\ntown of Omaha, in Nebraska. Since then the company has represented to me\r\nthat upon actual surveys made it has determined upon the precise point of\r\ndeparture of their said branch road from the Missouri River, and located\r\nthe same as described in the accompanying report of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, which point is within the limits designated in the order of\r\nNovember last; and inasmuch as that order is not of record in any of the\r\nExecutive Departments, and the company having desired a more definite one,\r\nI have made the order of which a copy is herewith, and caused the same to\r\nbe filed in the Department of the Interior.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO GENERAL GRANT,\r\n\r\nMARCH 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL GRANT:--The expression of the nation's approbation of what you\r\nhave already done, and its reliance on you for what remains to do in\r\nthe existing great struggle, is now presented with this commission\r\nconstituting you Lieutenant-General of the Army of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith this high honor, devolves on you an additional responsibility. As the\r\ncountry herein trusts you, so, under God, it will sustain you. I scarcely\r\nneed add, that with what I here speak for the country, goes my own hearty\r\npersonal concurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL GRANT'S REPLY.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT:--I accept this commission, with gratitude for the high\r\nhonor conferred.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the noble armies that have fought on so many fields for\r\nour common country, it will be my earnest endeavor not to disappoint your\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nI feel the full weight of the responsibilities now devolving on me, and I\r\nknow that if they are met, it will be due to those armies; and above all,\r\nto the favor of that Providence which leads both nations and men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER ASSIGNING U.

Do your best to get out the largest vote possible, and of\r\ncourse as much of it as possible on the right side.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL HAHN. (Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 13, 1864\r\n\r\nHON. MICHAEL HAHN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as\r\nthe first free-state governor of Louisiana. Now, you are about to have\r\na convention, which among other things will probably define the elective\r\nfranchise. I barely suggest for your private consideration, whether some\r\nof the colored people may not be let in,--as, for instance, the very\r\nintelligent, and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks.\r\nThey would probably help, in some trying time to come, to keep the\r\njewel of liberty within the family of freedom. But this is only a\r\nsuggestion,--not to the public, but to you alone.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALL FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, MARCH 14, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn order to supply the force required to be drafted for the Navy and to\r\nprovide an adequate reserve force for all contingencies, in addition\r\nto the five hundred thousand men called for February 1, 1864, a call\r\nis hereby made and a draft ordered for two hundred thousand men for the\r\nmilitary service (Army, Navy, and Marine Corps) of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe proportional quotas for the different wards, towns, townships,\r\nprecincts, or election districts, or counties, will be made known through\r\nthe Provost Marshal-General's Bureau, and account will be taken of the\r\ncredits and deficiencies on former quotas.\r\n\r\nThe 15th day of April, 1864, is designated as the time up to which the\r\nnumbers required from each ward of a city, town, etc., may be raised by\r\nvoluntary enlistment, and drafts will be made in each ward of a city,\r\ntown, etc., which shall not have filled the quota assigned to it within\r\nthe time designated for the number required to fill said quotas. The\r\ndrafts will be commenced as soon after the 15th of April as practicable.\r\n\r\nThe Government bounties as now paid continue until April I, 1864, at which\r\ntime the additional bounties cease. On and after that date one hundred\r\ndollars bounty only will be paid, as provided by the act approved July 22,\r\n1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT A FAIR IN THE PATENT OFFICE,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MARCH 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nI appear to say but a word. This extraordinary war in which we are engaged\r\nfalls heavily upon all classes of people but the most heavily upon the\r\nsoldier. For it has been said, \"All that a man hath will he give for his\r\nlife;\" and while all contribute of their substance, the soldier puts his\r\nlife at stake, and often yields it up in his country's cause. The highest\r\nmerit, then, is due to the soldier.\r\n\r\nIn this extraordinary war, extraordinary developments have manifested\r\nthemselves, such as have not been seen in former wars; and among these\r\nmanifestations nothing has been more remarkable than these fairs for the\r\nrelief of suffering soldiers and their families. And the chief agents of\r\nthese fairs are the women of America.\r\n\r\nI am not accustomed to the use of language of eulogy: I have never studied\r\nthe art of paying compliments to women; but I must say, that if all that\r\nhas been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in\r\npraise of women were applied to the women of America, it would not do them\r\njustice for their conduct during this war. I will close by saying, God\r\nbless the women of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A COMMITTEE FROM THE WORKINGMEN'S ASSOCIATION OF NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nMARCH 21, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:\r\n\r\nThe honorary membership in your association, as generously tendered, is\r\ngratefully accepted.\r\n\r\nYou comprehend, as your address shows, that the existing rebellion means\r\nmore and tends to do more than the perpetuation of African slavery--that\r\nit is, in fact, a war upon the rights of all working people. Partly to\r\nshow that this view has not escaped my attention, and partly that I cannot\r\nbetter express myself, I read a passage from the message to Congress in\r\nDecember, 1861:\r\n\r\n\"It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not\r\nexclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government, the\r\nrights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most\r\ngrave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the General\r\ntone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the abridgment of the\r\nexisting right of suffrage, and the denial to the people of all right to\r\nparticipate in the selection of public officers, except the legislature,\r\nboldly advocated, with labored argument to prove that large control of the\r\npeople in government is the source of all political evil. Monarchy itself\r\nis sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people.\r\nIn my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit\r\nraising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.\r\n\r\n\"It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a General argument should be\r\nmade in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its\r\nconnections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief\r\nattention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing, if not\r\nabove labor, in the structure of government. It is assumed that labor\r\nis available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless\r\nsomebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to\r\nlabor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital\r\nshall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent or\r\nbuy them, and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so\r\nit is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers, or\r\nwhat we call slaves. And, further, it is assumed that whoever is once a\r\nhired laborer, is fixed in that condition for life. Now there is no such\r\nrelation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is there any such thing\r\nas a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer.\r\nBoth these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are\r\ngroundless.\r\n\r\n\"Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit\r\nof labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.\r\nLabor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher\r\nconsideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection\r\nas any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always\r\nwill be, a relation between capital and labor, producing mutual benefits.\r\nThe error is in assuming that the whole labor of a community exists within\r\nthat relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves,\r\nand, with their capital, hire or buy another few to labor for them. A\r\nlarge majority belong to neither class--neither work for others, nor have\r\nothers working for them. In most of the Southern States, a majority of the\r\nwhole people, of all colors, are neither slaves nor masters; while in the\r\nNorthern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men with their\r\nfamilies, wives, sons, and daughters--work for themselves, on their\r\nfarms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to\r\nthemselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired\r\nlaborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable\r\nnumber of persons mingle their own labor with capital; that is, they labor\r\nwith their own hands, and also buy or hire others to labor for them, but\r\nthis is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle stated is\r\ndisturbed by the existence of this mixed class.\r\n\r\n\"Again, as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such\r\nthing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life.\r\nMany independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in their\r\nlives, were hired laborers. The prudent penniless beginner in the world\r\nlabors for wages a while, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land\r\nfor himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length\r\nhires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous\r\nand prosperous system which opens the way to all--gives hope to all, and\r\nconsequent energy and progress, and improvement of condition to all.\r\nNo men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from\r\npoverty--none less inclined to touch or take aught which they have not\r\nhonestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power they\r\nalready possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close\r\nthe door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new disabilities\r\nand burdens upon them, till all of liberty shall be lost.\"\r\n\r\nThe views then expressed remain unchanged, nor have I much to add. None\r\nare so deeply interested to resist the present rebellion as the working\r\npeople. Let them beware of prejudices, working division and hostility\r\namong themselves. The most notable feature of a disturbance in your\r\ncity last summer was the hanging of some working people by other working\r\npeople. It should never be so. The strongest bond of human sympathy,\r\noutside of the family relation, should be one uniting all working people,\r\nof all nations, and tongues, and kindreds. Nor should this lead to a war\r\nupon property, or the owners of property. Property is the fruit of labor;\r\nproperty is desirable; is a positive good in the world. That some\r\nshould be rich shows that others may become rich, and, hence, is just\r\nencouragement to industry and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless\r\npull down the house of another, but let him labor diligently and build\r\none for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from\r\nviolence when built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nHon. W. R. Morrison says he has requested you by letter to effect a\r\nspecial exchange of Lieut. Col. A. F. Rogers, of Eightieth Illinois\r\nVolunteers, now in Libby Prison, and I shall be glad if you can effect it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL C. SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n( Private.)\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 13, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of February 29 reached me only four days ago; but the\r\ndelay was of little consequence, because I found, on feeling around, I\r\ncould not invite you here without a difficulty which at least would be\r\nunpleasant, and perhaps would be detrimental to the public service. Allow\r\nme to suggest that if you wish to remain in the military service, it\r\nis very dangerous for you to get temporarily out of it; because, with a\r\nmajor-general once out, it is next to impossible for even the President\r\nto get him in again. With my appreciation of your ability and correct\r\nprinciple, of course I would be very glad to have your service for\r\nthe country in the approaching political canvass; but I fear we cannot\r\nproperly have it without separating you from the military.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION ABOUT AMNESTY,\r\n\r\nMARCH 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, it has become necessary to define the cases in which insurgent\r\nenemies are entitled to the benefits of the Proclamation of the President\r\nof the United States, which was made on the 8th day of December, 1863,\r\nand the manner in which they shall proceed to avail themselves of these\r\nbenefits; and whereas the objects of that Proclamation were to suppress\r\nthe insurrection and to restore the authority of the United States; and\r\nwhereas the amnesty therein proposed by the President was offered with\r\nreference to these objects alone:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby proclaim and declare that the said Proclamation does not apply\r\nto the cases of persons who, at the time when they seek to obtain the\r\nbenefits thereof by taking the oath thereby prescribed, are in military,\r\nnaval, or civil confinement or custody, or under bonds, or on parole of\r\nthe civil, military, or naval authorities, or agents of the United States,\r\nas prisoners of war, or persons detained for offences of any kind, either\r\nbefore or after conviction; and that on the contrary it does apply only\r\nto those persons who, being yet at large, and free from any arrest,\r\nconfinement, or duress, shall voluntarily come forward and take the said\r\noath, with the purpose of restoring peace, and establishing the national\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nPersons excluded from the amnesty offered in the said Proclamation may\r\napply to the President for clemency, like all other offenders, and their\r\napplication will receive due consideration.\r\n\r\nI do further declare and proclaim that the oath presented in the aforesaid\r\nproclamation of the 8th of December, 1863, may be taken and subscribed\r\nbefore any commissioned officer, civil, military, or naval, in the service\r\nof the United States, or any civil or military officer of a State or\r\nTerritory not in insurrection, who, by the laws thereof, may be qualified\r\nfor administering oaths.\r\n\r\nAll officers who receive such oaths are hereby authorized to give\r\ncertificates thereof to the persons respectively by whom they are made,\r\nand such officers are hereby required to transmit the original records of\r\nsuch oaths, at as early a day as may be convenient, to the Department of\r\nState, where they will be deposited, and remain in the archives of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State will keep a registry thereof, and will, on\r\napplication, in proper cases, issue certificates of such records in the\r\ncustomary form of official certificates.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed............\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The Governor of Kentucky is here, and desires to have the\r\nfollowing points definitely fixed:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the quotas of troops furnished, and to be furnished, by\r\nKentucky may be adjusted upon the basis as actually reduced by able-bodied\r\nmen of hers having gone into the rebel service; and that she be required\r\nto furnish no more than her just quotas upon fair adjustment upon such\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nSecond. To whatever extent the enlistment and drafting, one or both,\r\nof colored troops may be found necessary within the State, it may be\r\nconducted within the law of Congress; and, so far as practicable, free\r\nfrom collateral embarrassments, disorders, and provocations.\r\n\r\nI think these requests of the Governor are reasonable; and I shall be\r\nobliged if you will give him a full hearing, and do the best you can to\r\neffect these objects.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. G. MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter to Colonel Townsend, inclosing a slip from the\r\n\"Herald,\" and asking a court of inquiry, has been laid before me by the\r\nSecretary of War, with the request that I would consider it. It is quite\r\nnatural that you should feel some sensibility on the subject; yet I am not\r\nimpressed, nor do I think the country is impressed, with the belief that\r\nyour honor demands, or the public interest demands, such an inquiry. The\r\ncountry knows that at all events you have done good service; and I believe\r\nit agrees with me that it is much better for you to be engaged in trying\r\nto do more, than to be diverted, as you necessarily would be, by a court\r\nof inquiry.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 29,1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nCaptain Kinney, of whom I spoke to you as desiring to go on your staff,\r\nis now in your camp, in company with Mrs. Senator Dixon. Mrs. Grant and I,\r\nand some others, agreed last night that I should, by this despatch, kindly\r\ncall your attention to Captain Kinney.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. G. HODGES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nA. G. HODGES, ESQ., Frankfort, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--You ask me to put in writing the substance of what I\r\nverbally said the other day, in your presence, to Governor Bramlette and\r\nSenator Dixon. It was about as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.\r\nI cannot remember when I did not so think and feel, and yet I have never\r\nunderstood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to\r\nact officially upon this judgment and feeling. It was in the oath I took\r\nthat I would to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States. I could not take the office without\r\ntaking the oath. Nor was it my view that I might take an oath to get\r\npower, and break the oath in using the power. I understood, too, that in\r\nordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically\r\nindulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery. I\r\nhad publicly declared this many times, and in many ways. And I aver that,\r\nto this day, I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract\r\njudgment and feeling on slavery. I did understand, however, that my oath\r\nto preserve the Constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me\r\nthe duty of preserving, by every indispensable means, that government,\r\nthat nation, of which that Constitution was the organic law. Was it\r\npossible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution? By General\r\nlaw, life and limb must be protected; yet often a limb must be amputated\r\nto save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a limb. I\r\nfelt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful, by\r\nbecoming indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution, through\r\nthe preservation of the nation. Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and\r\nnow avow it. I could not feel that to the best of my ability I had even\r\ntried to preserve the Constitution, if, to save slavery, or any\r\nminor matter, I should permit the wreck of government, country, and\r\nConstitution, altogether. When, early in the war, General Fremont\r\nattempted military emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then\r\nthink it an indispensable necessity. When, a little later, General\r\nCameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks, I\r\nobjected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable necessity.\r\nWhen, still later, General Hunter attempted military emancipation, I again\r\nforbade it, because I did not yet think the indispensable necessity\r\nhad come. When, in March, and May, and July, 1862, I made earnest and\r\nsuccessive appeals to the Border States to favor compensated emancipation,\r\nI believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation and\r\narming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure. They\r\ndeclined the proposition, and I was, in my best judgment, driven to\r\nthe alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it the\r\nConstitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I chose\r\nthe latter. In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss, but of\r\nthis I was not entirely confident. More than a year of trial now shows no\r\nloss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment,\r\nnone in our white military force, no loss by it any how, or anywhere. On\r\nthe contrary, it shows a gain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand\r\nsoldiers, seamen, and laborers. These are palpable facts, about which, as\r\nfacts, there can be no caviling. We have the men; and we could not have\r\nhad them without the measure.\r\n\r\n\"And now let any Union man who complains of the measure test himself by\r\nwriting down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force\r\nof arms; and in the next, that he is for taking these hundred and thirty\r\nthousand men from the Union side, and placing them where they would be but\r\nfor the measure he condemns. If he cannot face his case so stated, it is\r\nonly because he cannot face the truth.\"\r\n\r\nI add a word which was not in the verbal conversation. In telling this\r\ntale I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity. I claim not to have\r\ncontrolled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.\r\nNow, at the end of three years' struggle, the nation's condition is not\r\nwhat either party, or any man, devised or expected. God alone can claim\r\nit. Whither it is tending seems plain. If God now wills the removal of a\r\ngreat wrong, and wills also that we of the North, as well as you of\r\nthe South, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial\r\nhistory will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and\r\ngoodness of God.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. HORACE MANN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nMRS HORACE MANN:\r\n\r\nMADAM:--The petition of persons under eighteen, praying that I would\r\nfree all slave children, and the heading of which petition it appears you\r\nwrote, was handed me a few days since by Senator Sumner. Please tell these\r\nlittle people I am very glad their young hearts are so full of just and\r\ngenerous sympathy, and that, while I have not the power to grant all they\r\nask, I trust they will remember that God has, and that, as it seems, he\r\nwills to do it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 12, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nI am pressed to get from Libby, by special exchange, Jacob C. Hagenbuek,\r\nfirst lieutenant, Company H, Sixty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers. Please\r\ndo it if you can without detriment or embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nPrivate William Collins of Company B, of the Sixty-ninth New York\r\nVolunteers, has been convicted of desertion, and execution suspended as\r\nin numerous other cases. Now Captain O'Neill, commanding the regiment,\r\nand nearly all its other regimental and company officers, petition for his\r\nfull pardon and restoration to his company. Is there any good objection?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE ON LIBERTY\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT SANITARY FAIR IN BALTIMORE,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--Calling to mind that we are in Baltimore, we\r\ncannot fail to note that the world moves. Looking upon these many people\r\nassembled here to serve, as they best may, the soldiers of the Union, it\r\noccurs at once that three years ago the same soldiers could not so much\r\nas pass through Baltimore. The change from then till now is both great and\r\ngratifying. Blessings on the brave men who have wrought the change, and\r\nthe fair women who strive to reward them for it!\r\n\r\nBut Baltimore suggests more than could happen within Baltimore. The change\r\nwithin Baltimore is part only of a far wider change. When the war began,\r\nthree years ago, neither party, nor any man, expected it would last till\r\nnow. Each looked for the end, in some way, long ere to-day. Neither did\r\nany anticipate that domestic slavery would be much affected by the war.\r\nBut here we are; the war has not ended, and slavery has been much affected\r\nhow much needs not now to be recounted. So true is it that man proposes\r\nand God disposes.\r\n\r\nBut we can see the past, though we may not claim to have directed it;\r\nand seeing it, in this case, we feel more hopeful and confident for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the\r\nAmerican people, just now, are much in want of one. We all declare for\r\nliberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing.\r\nWith some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with\r\nhimself, and the product of his labor; while with others the same word may\r\nmean for some men to do as they please with other men, and the product\r\nof other men's labor. Here are two, not only different, but incompatible\r\nthings, called by the same name, liberty. And it follows that each of\r\nthe things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and\r\nincompatible names--liberty and tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep\r\nthanks the shepherd as his liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the\r\nsame act, as the destroyer of liberty, especially as the sheep was a black\r\none. Plainly, the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of\r\nthe word liberty; and precisely the same difference prevails to-day among\r\nus human creatures, even in the North, and all professing to love liberty.\r\nHence we behold the process by which thousands are daily passing from\r\nunder the yoke of bondage hailed by some as the advance of liberty, and\r\nbewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty. Recently, as it\r\nseems, the people of Maryland have been doing something to define liberty,\r\nand thanks to them that, in what they have done, the wolf's dictionary has\r\nbeen repudiated.\r\n\r\nIt is not very becoming for one in my position to make speeches at length;\r\nbut there is another subject upon which I feel that I ought to say a word.\r\nA painful rumor, true, I fear, has reached us, of the massacre, by\r\nthe rebel forces at Fort Pillow, in the west end of Tennessee, on the\r\nMississippi River, of some three hundred colored soldiers and white\r\nofficers [I believe it latter turned out to be 500], who had just been\r\noverpowered by their assailants [numbering 5000]. There seems to be some\r\nanxiety in the public mind whether the Government is doing its duty to the\r\ncolored soldier, and to the service, at this point. At the beginning\r\nof the war, and for some time, the use of colored troops was not\r\ncontemplated; and how the change of purpose was wrought I will not now\r\ntake time to explain. Upon a clear conviction of duty I resolved to turn\r\nthat element of strength to account; and I am responsible for it to the\r\nAmerican people, to the Christian world, to history, and in my final\r\naccount to God. Having determined to use the negro as a soldier, there is\r\nno way but to give him all the protection given to any other soldier. The\r\ndifficulty is not in stating the principle, but in practically applying\r\nit. It is a mistake to suppose the Government is indifferent to this\r\nmatter, or is not doing the best it can in regard to it. We do not to-day\r\nknow that a colored soldier, or white officer commanding colored soldiers,\r\nhas been massacred by the rebels when made a prisoner. We fear it, we\r\nbelieve it, I may say,--but we do not know it. To take the life of one of\r\ntheir prisoners on the assumption that they murder ours, when it is short\r\nof certainty that they do murder ours, might be too serious, too cruel, a\r\nmistake. We are having the Fort Pillow affair thoroughly investigated; and\r\nsuch investigation will probably show conclusively how the truth is. If\r\nafter all that has been said it shall turn out that there has been no\r\nmassacre at Fort Pillow, it will be almost safe to say there has been\r\nnone, and will be none, elsewhere. If there has been the massacre of\r\nthree hundred there, or even the tenth part of three hundred, it will be\r\nconclusively proved; and being so proved, the retribution shall as surely\r\ncome. It will be matter of grave consideration in what exact course to\r\napply the retribution; but in the supposed case it must come.\r\n\r\n[There was a massacre of a black company and their officers at Fort\r\nPillow--they were prisoners who later on, the day of their capture,\r\nwere ordered executed. The black soldiers were tied alive to individual\r\nplanks--then man and plank were cobbled up like cord wood and burned. The\r\nwhite officers were shot.

SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--According to our understanding with Major-General Frank P.\r\nBlair at the time he took his seat in Congress last winter, he now asks to\r\nwithdraw his resignation as Major-General, then tendered, and be sent to\r\nthe field. Let this be done. Let the order sending him be such as shown me\r\nto-day by the Adjutant-General, only dropping from it the names of Maguire\r\nand Tompkins.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Thanks for your kind remembrance. I\r\nwould accept your offer at once, were it not that I fear there might be\r\nsome impropriety in it, though I do not see that there would. I will think\r\nof it a while.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

The record has been\r\nexamined here, and it shows too strong a case for a pardon or commutation,\r\nunless there is something in the poor man's favor outside of the record,\r\nwhich you on the ground may know, but I do not. My note to you only means\r\nthat if you know of any such thing rendering a suspension of the execution\r\nproper, on your own judgment, you are at liberty to suspend it. Otherwise\r\nI do not interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL THOMAS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.

Whatever I can I will do to protect you; meanwhile you must do your\r\nutmost to protect yourselves. Present my greeting to all.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS, APRIL 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith an address to the President of\r\nthe United States, and through him to both Houses of Congress, on the\r\ncondition and wants of the people of east Tennessee, and asking their\r\nattention to the necessity of some action on the part of the Government\r\nfor their relief, and which address is presented by a committee of an\r\norganization called \"The East Tennessee Relief Association.\"\r\n\r\nDeeply commiserating the condition of these most loyal and suffering\r\npeople, I am unprepared to make any specific recommendation for their\r\nrelief. The military is doing and will continue to do the best for them\r\nwithin its power. Their address represents that the construction of direct\r\nrailroad communication between Knoxville and Cincinnati by way of central\r\nKentucky would be of great consequence in the present emergency. It may\r\nbe remembered that in the annual message of December, 1861, such railroad\r\nconstruction was recommended. I now add that, with the hearty concurrence\r\nof Congress, I would yet be pleased to construct a road, both for the\r\nrelief of these people and for its continuing military importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the resolution of your honorable body, a copy of which is\r\nherewith returned, I have the honor to make the following brief statement,\r\nwhich is believed to contain the information sought:\r\n\r\nPrior to and at the meeting of the present Congress, Robert C. Schenck, of\r\nOhio, and Frank P. Blair, Jr., of Missouri, members elect thereto, by\r\nand with the consent of the Senate held commissions from the Executive\r\nas major-generals in the volunteer army. General Schenck tendered the\r\nresignation of his said commission, and took his seat in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, at the assembling thereof, upon the distinct verbal\r\nunderstanding with the Secretary of War and the Executive that he might,\r\nat any time during the session, at his own pleasure, withdraw said\r\nresignation and return to the field.\r\n\r\nGeneral Blair was, by temporary assignment of General Sherman, in command\r\nof a corps through the battles in front of Chattanooga, and in the march\r\nto the relief of Knoxville, which occurred in the latter days of November\r\nand early days of December last, and of course was not present at the\r\nassembling of Congress. When he subsequently arrived here, he sought, and\r\nwas allowed by the Secretary of War and the Executive, the same conditions\r\nand promise as allowed and made to General Schenck.\r\n\r\nGeneral Schenck has not applied to withdraw his resignation; but when\r\nGeneral Grant was made Lieutenant-General, producing some change of\r\ncommanders, General Blair sought to be assigned to the command of a corps.\r\nThis was made known to Generals Grant and Sherman, and assented to by\r\nthem, and the particular corps for him designated.\r\n\r\nThis was all arranged and understood, as now remembered, so much as a\r\nmonth ago; but the formal withdrawal of General Blair's resignation,\r\nand making the order assigning him to the command of the corps, were not\r\nconsummated at the War Department until last week, perhaps on the 23d of\r\nApril instant. As a summary of the whole, it may be stated that General\r\nBlair holds no military commission or appointment other than as herein\r\nstated, and that it is believed he is now acting as major-General upon the\r\nassumed validity of the commission herein stated, in connection with the\r\nfacts herein stated, and not otherwise. There are some letters, notes,\r\ntelegrams, orders, entries, and perhaps other documents in connection with\r\nthis subject, which it is believed would throw no additional light upon\r\nit, but which will be cheerfully furnished if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 30, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nNot expecting to see you before the spring campaign opens, I wish to\r\nexpress in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to\r\nthis time, so far as I understand it.\r\n\r\nThe particulars of your plans I neither know nor seek to know. You are\r\nvigilant and self-reliant; and, pleased with this, I wish not to obtrude\r\nany restraints or constraints upon you. While I am very anxious that any\r\ngreat disaster or capture of our men in great number shall be avoided, I\r\nknow that these points are less likely to escape your attention than they\r\nwould be mine. If there be anything wanting which is within my power to\r\ngive, do not fail to let me know it.\r\n\r\nAnd now, with a brave army and a just cause, may God sustain you.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nMAY 2, 1864.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request contained in your resolution of the 29th\r\nultimo, a copy of which resolution is herewith returned, I have the honor\r\nto transmit the following:\r\n\r\n[Correspondence and orders relating to the resignation and reinstatement\r\nof Major-General Frank P. Blair, Jr., of Missouri.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing constitutes all sought by the resolution so far as is\r\nremembered or has been found upon diligent search.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., May 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Chattanooga, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nI have an imploring appeal in behalf of the citizens who say your Order\r\nNo.8 will compel them to go north of Nashville. This is in no sense an\r\norder, nor is it even a request that you will do anything which in the\r\nleast shall be a drawback upon your military operations, but anything you\r\ncan do consistently with those operations for those suffering people I\r\nshall be glad of.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Commanding, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to inquire whether a day has yet been fixed for\r\nthe execution of citizen Robert Louden, and if so what day?\r\n\r\nJOHN HAY, Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. S. B. McCONKEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nMRS. SARAH B. McCONKEY, West Chester, Pa.:\r\n\r\nMADAM:--Our mutual friend, Judge Lewis, tells me you do me the honor to\r\ninquire for my personal welfare. I have been very anxious for some days in\r\nregard to our armies in the field, but am considerably cheered, just now,\r\nby favorable news from them.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will join me in the hope for their further success; while\r\nyourself, and other good mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters, do all\r\nyou and they can, to relieve and comfort the gallant soldiers who compose\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION OF THANKSGIVING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 9, 1864\r\n\r\nTO THE FRIENDS OF UNION AND LIBERTY:\r\n\r\nEnough is known of army operations, within the last five days, to claim\r\nour special gratitude to God. While what remains undone demands our most\r\nsincere prayers to and reliance upon Him (without whom all effort is\r\nvain), I recommend that all patriots at their homes, in their places of\r\npublic worship, and wherever they may be, unite in common thanksgiving and\r\nprayer to Almighty God.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE,\r\n\r\nMAY 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I am very much obliged to you for the compliment of this\r\ncall, though I apprehend it is owing more to the good news received to-day\r\nfrom the Army, than to a desire to see me. I am indeed very grateful to\r\nthe brave men who have been struggling with the enemy in the field, to\r\ntheir noble commanders who have directed them, and especially to our\r\nMaker. Our commanders are following up their victories resolutely and\r\nsuccessfully. I think, without knowing the particulars of the plans of\r\nGeneral Grant, that what has been accomplished is of more importance than\r\nat first appears. I believe, I know (and am especially grateful to know)\r\nthat General Grant has not been jostled in his purposes, that he has made\r\nall his points, and to-day he is on his line as he purposed before he\r\nmoved his armies. I will volunteer to say that I am very glad at what\r\nhas happened, but there is a great deal still to be done. While we are\r\ngrateful to all the brave men and officers for the events of the past few\r\ndays, we should, above all, be very grateful to Almighty God, who gives us\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThere is enough yet before us requiring all loyal men and patriots to\r\nperform their share of the labor and follow the example of the modest\r\nGeneral at the head of our armies, and sink all personal consideration\r\nfor the sake of the country. I commend you to keep yourselves in the same\r\ntranquil mood that is characteristic of that brave and loyal man. I have\r\nsaid more than I expected when I came before you. Repeating my thanks for\r\nthis call, I bid you good-bye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL LEW WALLACE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., May 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL WALLACE, Baltimore:\r\n\r\nPlease tell me what is the trouble with Dr. Hawks. Also please ask Bishop\r\nWhittington to give me his view of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 11, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nComplaints are coming to me of disturbances in Canoll, Platte, and\r\nBuchanan counties. Please ascertain the truth, correct what is found\r\nwrong, and telegraph me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. B. LOOMIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 12, 1864\r\n\r\nF. B. LOOMIS, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\ncommunication of the 28th April, in which you offer to replace the present\r\ngarrison at Port Trumbull with volunteers, which you propose to raise at\r\nyour own expense. While it seems inexpedient at this time to accept\r\nthis proposition on account of the special duties now devolving upon the\r\ngarrison mentioned, I cannot pass unnoticed such a meritorious instance\r\nof individual patriotism. Permit me, for the Government, to express my\r\ncordial thanks to you for this generous and public-spirited offer, which\r\nis worthy of note among the many called forth in these times of national\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nI am very truly, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A METHODIST DELEGATION, MAY 14, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:-In response to your address, allow me to attest the accuracy of\r\nits historical statements, indorse the sentiments it expresses, and thank\r\nyou in the nation's name for the sure promise it gives. Nobly sustained,\r\nas the Government has been, by all the churches, I would utter nothing\r\nwhich might in the least appear invidious against any. Yet without this,\r\nit may fairly be said, that the Methodist Episcopal Church, not less\r\ndevoted than the best, is by its greatest numbers the most important\r\nof all. It is no fault in others that the Methodist Church sends more\r\nsoldiers to the field, more nurses to the hospitals, and more prayers\r\nto Heaven than--any other. God bless the Methodist Church Bless all the\r\nchurches; and blessed be God, who in this our great trial giveth us the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR YATES.

DIX.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL JOHN A. DIX, Commanding at New York:\r\n\r\nWhereas there has been wickedly and traitorously printed and published\r\nthis morning in the New York World and New York Journal of Commerce,\r\nnewspapers printed and published in the city of New York, a false and\r\nspurious proclamation purporting to be signed by the President and to\r\nbe countersigned by the Secretary of State, which publication is of a\r\ntreasonable nature, designed to give aid and comfort to the enemies of\r\nthe United States and to the rebels now at war against the Government and\r\ntheir aiders and abettors, you are therefore hereby commanded forthwith\r\nto arrest and imprison in any fort or military prison in your command, the\r\neditors, proprietors, and publishers of the aforesaid newspapers, and all\r\nsuch persons as, after public notice has been given of the falsehood of\r\nsaid publication, print and publish the same with intent to give aid and\r\ncomfort to the enemy; and you will hold the persons so arrested in close\r\ncustody until they can be brought to trial before a military commission\r\nfor their offense. You will also take possession by military force of the\r\nprinting establishments of the New York World and Journal of Commerce, and\r\nhold the same until further orders, and prohibit any further publication\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[On the morning of May 18, 3864, a forged proclamation was published in\r\nthe World, and Journal of Commerce, of New York.

C., May 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Bermuda Hundred, Va.:\r\n\r\nUntil receiving your dispatch of yesterday, the idea of commissions in the\r\nvolunteers expiring at the end of three years had not occurred to me. I\r\nthink no trouble will come of it; and, at all events, I shall take care of\r\nit so far as in me lies. As to the major-generalships in the regular\r\narmy, I think I shall not dispose of another, at least until the combined\r\noperations now in progress, under direction of General Grant, and within\r\nwhich yourself and command are included, shall be terminated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on behalf of yourself, officers, and men, please accept my\r\nhearty thanks for what you and they have so far done.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE EXEMPTION OF AMERICAN CONSULS FROM MILITARY SERVICE\r\n\r\nMAY 19, 1864.\r\n\r\nIt is officially announced by the State Department that citizens of the\r\nUnited States holding commissions and recognized as Consuls of foreign\r\npowers, are not by law exempt from military service if drafted:\r\n\r\nTherefore the mere enrolment of a citizen holding a foreign consulate\r\nwill not be held to vacate his commission, but if he shall be drafted\r\nhis exequatur will be revoked unless he shall have previously resigned in\r\norder that another Consul may be received.\r\n\r\nAn exequatur bearing date the 3d day of May, 1858, having been issued to\r\nCharles Hunt, a citizen of the United States, recognizing him as a Consul\r\nof Belgium for St. Louis, Missouri, and declaring him free to exercise and\r\nenjoy such functions, powers, and privileges as are allowed to the Consuls\r\nof the most favored nations in the United States, and the said Hunt\r\nhaving sought to screen himself from his military duty to his country,\r\nin consequence of thus being invested with the consular functions of a\r\nforeign power in the United States, it is deemed advisable that the said\r\nCharles Hunt should no longer be permitted to continue in the exercise of\r\nsaid functions, powers, and privileges.\r\n\r\nThese are therefore to declare that I no longer recognize the said Hunt\r\nas Consul of Belgium, for St. Louis, Missouri, and will not permit him to\r\nexercise or enjoy any of the functions, powers or privileges allowed to\r\nconsuls of that nation, and that I do hereby wholly revoke and annul the\r\nsaid exequatur heretofore given, and do declare the same to be absolutely\r\nnull and void from this day forward.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have caused these letters to be made patent,\r\nand the seal of the United States of America to be hereunto\r\naffixed................\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR MORTON AND OTHERS. EXECUTIVE MANSION, May 21, 1864\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR O. P. MORTON:\r\n\r\nThe getting forward of hundred-day troops to sustain General Sherman's\r\nlengthening lines promises much good. Please put your best efforts into\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nSame to Governor Yates, Springfield, Illinois; Governor Stone, Davenport,\r\nIowa; Governor Lewis, Madison, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO CHRISTIANA A. SACK. WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D. C., May 21,\r\n1864\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANA A. SACK, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nI cannot postpone the execution of a convicted spy on a mere telegraphic\r\ndespatch signed with a name I never heard before. General Wallace may give\r\nyou a pass to see him if he chooses.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BROUGH. WASHINGTON CITY, May 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR BROUGH, Columbus, Ohio:\r\n\r\nYours to Secretary of War [received] asking for something cheering. We\r\nhave nothing bad from anywhere. I have just seen a despatch of Grant, of\r\n11 P.M., May 23, on the North Anna and partly across it, which ends as\r\nfollows: \"Everything looks exceedingly favorable for us.\" We have nothing\r\nlater from him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 25,1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nMr. J. C. Swift wishes a pass from me to follow your army to pick up rags\r\nand cast-off clothing. I will give it to him if you say so, otherwise not.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[\"No job to big or too small\" for this president--not even a request from\r\na Rag Picker. D.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM CONCERNING THE TRANSPORTATION OF THE NEW YORK NAVAL BRIGADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nWHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\r\n\r\nI am again pressed with the claim of Mr. Marshall O. Roberts, for\r\ntransportation of what was called the Naval Brigade from New York to\r\nFortress Monroe. This force was a special organization got up by one\r\nBartlett, in pretended pursuance of written authority from me, but in\r\nfact, pursuing the authority in scarcely anything whatever. The\r\ncredit given him by Mr. Roberts, was given in the teeth of the express\r\ndeclaration that the Government would not be responsible for the class of\r\nexpenses to which it belonged. After all some part of the transportation\r\nbecame useful to the Government, and equitably should be paid for; but\r\nI have neither time nor means to ascertain this equitable amount, or any\r\nappropriation to pay it with if ascertained. If the Quartermaster at New\r\nYork can ascertain what would compensate for so much of the transportation\r\nas did result usefully to the Government, it might be a step towards\r\nreaching justice. I write this from memory, but I believe it is\r\nsubstantially correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. A. CONKLING AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. F. A. CONKLING AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter, inviting me to be present at a mass meeting of\r\nloyal citizens, to be held at New York on the 4th instant, for the\r\npurpose of expressing gratitude to Lieutenant-General Grant for his signal\r\nservices, was received yesterday. It is impossible for me to attend. I\r\napprove, nevertheless, of whatever may tend to strengthen and sustain\r\nGeneral Grant and the noble armies now under his direction. My previous\r\nhigh estimate of General Grant has been maintained and heightened by what\r\nhas occurred in the remarkable campaign he is now conducting, while the\r\nmagnitude and difficulty of the task before him does not prove less than\r\nI expected. He and his brave soldiers are now in the midst of their great\r\ntrial, and I trust that at your meeting you will so shape your good words\r\nthat they may turn to men and guns, moving to his and their support.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT ON A LETTER TOUCHING THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nJUNE 5, 1864.\r\n\r\n(Indorsement.)\r\n\r\nSwett is unquestionably all right. Mr. Holt is a good man, but I had not\r\nheard or thought of him for Vice-President. Wish not to interfere about\r\nVice-President. Cannot interfere about platform. Convention must judge for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nPrivate James McCarthy, of the One-hundred and fortieth New York\r\nVolunteers, is here under sentence to the Dry Tortugas for an attempt to\r\ndesert. His friends appeal to me and if his colonel and you consent, I\r\nwill send him to his regiment. Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS. WASHINGTON, June 8, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day received. I am unable to conceive how a message can be\r\nless safe by the express than by a staff-officer. If you send a verbal\r\nmessage, the messenger is one additional person let into the secret.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE COMMITTEE NOTIFYING PRESIDENT LINCOLN OF HIS RENOMINATION,\r\n\r\nJUNE 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:\r\n\r\nI will neither conceal my gratification nor restrain the expression of\r\nmy gratitude that the Union people, through their convention, in their\r\ncontinued effort to save and advance the nation, have deemed me not\r\nunworthy to remain in my present position. I know no reason to doubt\r\nthat I shall accept the nomination tendered; and yet perhaps I should\r\nnot declare definitely before reading and considering what is called the\r\nplatform. I will say now, however, I approve the declaration in favor of\r\nso amending the Constitution as to prohibit slavery throughout the nation.\r\nWhen the people in revolt, with a hundred days of explicit notice that\r\nthey could within those days resume their allegiance without the overthrow\r\nof their institution, and that they could not so resume it afterward,\r\nelected to stand out, such amendment of the Constitution as now proposed\r\nbecame a fitting and necessary conclusion to the final success of\r\nthe Union cause. Such alone can meet and cover all cavils. Now the\r\nunconditional Union men, North and South, perceive its importance and\r\nembrace it. In the joint names of Liberty and Union, let us labor to give\r\nit legal form and practical effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATFORM OF THE UNION NATIONAL CONVENTION HELD IN BALTIMORE, MD., JUNE 7\r\nAND 8, 1864.\r\n\r\n1. Resolved, That it is the highest duty of every American citizen to\r\nmaintain against all their enemies the integrity of the Union and the\r\nparamount authority of the Constitution and laws of the United States;\r\nand that, laying aside all differences of political opinion, we pledge\r\nourselves, as Union men, animated by a common sentiment and aiming at\r\na common object, to do everything in our power to aid the Government in\r\nquelling by force of arms the rebellion now raging against its authority,\r\nand in bringing to the punishment due to their crimes the rebels and\r\ntraitors arrayed against it.\r\n\r\n2. Resolved, That we approve the determination of the Government of the\r\nUnited States not to compromise with rebels, or to offer them any terms\r\nof peace, except such as may be based upon an unconditional surrender of\r\ntheir hostility and a return to their just allegiance to the Constitution\r\nand laws of the United States, and that we call upon the Government to\r\nmaintain this position, and to prosecute the war with the utmost possible\r\nvigor to the complete suppression of the rebellion, in full reliance\r\nupon the self-sacrificing patriotism, the heroic valor, and the\r\nundying devotion of the American people to their Country and its free\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n3. Resolved, That as slavery was the cause, and now constitutes the\r\nstrength, of this rebellion, and as it must be, always and everywhere,\r\nhostile to the principles of republican government, justice and the\r\nnational safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil\r\nof the republic; and that while we uphold and maintain the acts and\r\nproclamations by which the Government, in its own defense, has aimed a\r\ndeath-blow at this gigantic evil, we are in favor, furthermore, of such an\r\namendment to the Constitution, to be made by the people in conformity with\r\nits provisions, as shall terminate and forever prohibit the existence of\r\nslavery within the limits or the jurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\n4. Resolved, That the thanks of the American people are due to the\r\nsoldiers and sailors of the Army and Navy, who have periled their lives in\r\ndefense of their country and in vindication of the honor of its flag; that\r\nthe nation owes to them some permanent recognition of their patriotism\r\nand their valor, and ample and permanent provision for those of their\r\nsurvivors who have received disabling and honorable wounds in the service\r\nof the country; and that the memories of those who have fallen in its\r\ndefense shall be held in grateful and everlasting remembrance.\r\n\r\n5. Resolved, That we approve and applaud the practical wisdom, the\r\nunselfish patriotism, and the unswerving fidelity to the Constitution\r\nand the principles of American liberty, with which Abraham Lincoln has\r\ndischarged under circumstances of unparalleled difficulty the great duties\r\nand responsibilities of the Presidential office; that we approve and\r\nindorse as demanded by the emergency and essential to the preservation of\r\nthe nation, and as within the provisions of the Constitution, the measures\r\nand acts which he has adopted to defend the nation against its open\r\nand secret foes; that we approve, especially, the Proclamation of\r\nEmancipation, and the employment as Union soldiers of men heretofore held\r\nin slavery; and that we have full confidence in his determination to carry\r\nthese and all other constitutional measures essential to the salvation of\r\nthe country into full and complete effect.\r\n\r\n6. Resolved, That we deem it essential to the General welfare that harmony\r\nshould prevail in the national councils, and we regard as worthy of\r\npublic confidence and official trust those only who cordially indorse the\r\nprinciples proclaimed in these resolutions, and which should characterize\r\nthe administration of the Government.\r\n\r\n7. Resolved, That the Government owes to all men employed in its armies,\r\nwithout regard to distinction of color, the full protection of the laws of\r\nwar, and that any violation of these laws, or of the usages of civilized\r\nnations in time of war, by the rebels now in arms, should be made the\r\nsubject of prompt and full redress.\r\n\r\n8. Resolved, That foreign immigration, which in the past has added so much\r\nto the wealth, development of resources, and increase of power to this\r\nnation, the asylum of the oppressed of all nations, should be fostered and\r\nencouraged by a liberal and just policy.\r\n\r\n9. Resolved, That we are in favor of the speedy construction of the\r\nrailroad to the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n10. Resolved, That the national faith, pledged for the redemption of\r\nthe public debt, must be kept inviolate, and that for this purpose we\r\nrecommend economy and rigid responsibility in the public expenditures, and\r\na vigorous and just system of taxation: and that it is the duty of every\r\nloyal State to sustain the credit and promote the use of the national\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\n11. Resolved, That we approve the position taken by the Government that\r\nthe people of the United States can never regard with indifference the\r\nattempt of any European power to overthrow by force or to supplant\r\nby fraud the institutions of any republican government on the Western\r\nContinent, and that they will view with extreme jealousy, as menacing to\r\nthe peace and independence of their own country, the efforts of any such\r\npower to obtain new footholds for monarchical governments, sustained by\r\nforeign military force, in near proximity to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A DELEGATION FROM THE NATIONAL UNION LEAGUE,\r\n\r\nJUNE 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN--I can only say in response to the remarks of your chairman,\r\nthat I am very grateful for the renewed confidence which has been accorded\r\nto me, both by the convention and by the National League. I am not\r\ninsensible at all to the personal compliment there is in this, yet I do\r\nnot allow myself to believe that any but a small portion of it is to\r\nbe appropriated as a personal compliment to me. The convention and the\r\nnation, I am assured, are alike animated by a higher view of the interests\r\nof the country, for the present and the great future, and the part I am\r\nentitled to appropriate as a compliment is only that part which I may lay\r\nhold of as being the opinion of the convention and of the League, that I\r\nam not entirely unworthy to be intrusted with the place I have occupied\r\nfor the last three years. I have not permitted myself, gentlemen, to\r\nconclude that I am the best man in the country; but I am reminded in this\r\nconnection of a story of an old Dutch farmer, who remarked to a companion\r\nonce that \"it was not best to swap horses when crossing a stream.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A DELEGATION FROM OHIO,\r\n\r\nJUNE 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--I am very much obliged to you for this compliment. I have just\r\nbeen saying, and will repeat it, that the hardest of all speeches I have\r\nto answer is a serenade. I never know what to say on these occasions. I\r\nsuppose that you have done me this kindness in connection with the action\r\nof the Baltimore convention, which has recently taken place, and with\r\nwhich, of course, I am very well satisfied. What we want still more than\r\nBaltimore conventions, or Presidential elections, is success under General\r\nGrant. I propose that you constantly bear in mind that the support you\r\nowe to the brave officers and soldiers in the field is of the very first\r\nimportance, and we should therefore bend all our energies to that point.\r\nNow without detaining you any longer, I propose that you help me to close\r\nup what I am now saying with three rousing cheers for General Grant and\r\nthe officers and soldiers under his command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE ENVOY FROM THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS,\r\n\r\nJUNE 11, 1864.\r\n\r\nSIR:--In every light in which the State of the Hawaiian Islands can be\r\ncontemplated, it is an object of profound interest for the United States.\r\nVirtually it was once a colony. It is now a near and intimate neighbor.\r\nIt is a haven of shelter and refreshment for our merchants, fishermen,\r\nseamen, and other citizens, when on their lawful occasions they are\r\nnavigating the eastern seas and oceans. Its people are free, and its\r\nlaws, language, and religion are largely the fruit of our own teaching and\r\nexample. The distinguished part which you, Mr. Minister, have acted in\r\nthe history of that interesting country, is well known here. It gives me\r\npleasure to assure you of my sincere desire to do what I can to render now\r\nyour sojourn in the United States agreeable to yourself, satisfactory to\r\nyour sovereign, and beneficial to the Hawaiian people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS TO AN OHIO REGIMENT,\r\n\r\nJUNE 11, 1864.\r\n\r\nSoldiers! I understand you have just come from Ohio; come to help us in\r\nthis the nation's day of trial, and also of its hopes. I thank you for\r\nyour promptness in responding to the call for troops. Your services were\r\nnever needed more than now. I know not where you are going. You may stay\r\nhere and take the places of those who will be sent to the front, or you\r\nmay go there yourselves. Wherever you go I know you will do your best.\r\nAgain I thank you. Good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL L. THOMAS. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 13,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nComplaint is made to me that in the vicinity of Henderson, our militia\r\nis seizing negroes and carrying them off without their own consent, and\r\naccording to no rules whatever, except those of absolute violence. I wish\r\nyou would look into this and inform me, and see that the making soldiers\r\nof negroes is done according to the rules you are acting upon, so that\r\nunnecessary provocation and irritation be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO THOMAS WEBSTER. WASHINGTON, D. C., June 13, 1864.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WEBSTER, Philadelphia:\r\n\r\nWill try to leave here Wednesday afternoon, say at 4 P.M., remain till\r\nThursday afternoon and then return. This subject to events.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, June 15, 1864. 7 A.M.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nI have just received your dispatch of 1 P.M. yesterday. I begin to see it:\r\nyou will succeed. God bless you all.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT A SANITARY FAIR IN PHILADELPHIA,\r\n\r\nJUNE 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nI suppose that this toast is intended to open the way for me to say\r\nsomething. War at the best is terrible, and this of ours in its magnitude\r\nand duration is one of the most terrible the world has ever known. It\r\nhas deranged business totally in many places, and perhaps in all. It has\r\ndestroyed property, destroyed life, and ruined homes. It has produced a\r\nnational debt and a degree of taxation unprecedented in the history of\r\nthis country. It has caused mourning among us until the heavens may\r\nalmost be said to be hung in black. And yet it continues. It has had\r\naccompaniments not before known in the history of the world. I mean the\r\nSanitary and Christian Commissions, with their labors for the relief of\r\nthe soldiers, and the Volunteer Refreshment Saloons, understood better by\r\nthose who hear me than by myself, and these fairs, first begun at Chicago\r\nand next held in Boston, Cincinnati, and other cities. The motive and\r\nobject that lie at the bottom of them are worthy of the most that we can\r\ndo for the soldier who goes to fight the battles of his country. From the\r\nfair and tender hand of women is much, very much, done for the soldier,\r\ncontinually reminding him of the care and thought for him at home. The\r\nknowledge that he is not forgotten is grateful to his heart. Another\r\nview of these institutions is worthy of thought. They are voluntary\r\ncontributions, giving proof that the national resources are not at all\r\nexhausted, and that the national patriotism will sustain us through all.\r\nIt is a pertinent question, When is this war to end? I do not wish to name\r\nthe day when it will end, lest the end should not come at the given time.\r\nWe accepted this war, and did not begin it. We accepted it for an object,\r\nand when that object is accomplished the war will end, and I hope to God\r\nthat it will never end until that object is accomplished. We are going\r\nthrough with our task, so far as I am concerned, if it takes us three\r\nyears longer. I have not been in the habit of making predictions, but I\r\nam almost tempted now to hazard one. I will. It is, that Grant is this\r\nevening in a position, with Meade and Hancock, of Pennsylvania, whence he\r\ncan never be dislodged by the enemy until Richmond is taken. If I shall\r\ndiscover that General Grant may be greatly facilitated in the capture\r\nof Richmond by rapidly pouring to him a large number of armed men at the\r\nbriefest notice, will you go? Will you march on with him? [Cries of \"Yes,\r\nyes.\"] Then I shall call upon you when it is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTORNEY-GENERAL BATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, Jun. 24, 1864\r\n\r\nHONORABLE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nSIR:--By authority of the Constitution, and moved thereto by the fourth\r\nsection of the act of Congress, entitled \"An act making appropriations\r\nfor the support of the army for the year ending the thirtieth of June,\r\neighteen hundred and sixty-five, and for other purposes, approved June\r\nis, 1864,\" I require your opinion in writing as to what pay, bounty,\r\nand clothing are allowed by law to persons of color who were free on the\r\nnineteenth day of April, 1861, and who have been enlisted and mustered\r\ninto the military service of the United States between the month of\r\nDecember, 1862, and the sixteenth of June, 1864.\r\n\r\nPlease answer as you would do, on my requirement, if the act of June 15,\r\n1864, had not been passed, and I will so use your opinion as to satisfy\r\nthat act.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN, Boston, Massachusetts:\r\n\r\nAll well and very warm. Tad and I have been to General Grant's army.\r\nReturned yesterday safe and sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS. WASHINGTON, June 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nComplaint is made to me that General Brown does not do his best to\r\nsuppress bushwhackers. Please ascertain and report to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER ACCEPTING THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM DENNISON AND OTHERS, a Committee of the Union National\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter of the 14th inst.., formally notifying me that I\r\nhave been nominated by the convention you represent for the Presidency\r\nof the United States for four years from the 4th of March next, has been\r\nreceived. The nomination is gratefully accepted, as the resolutions of the\r\nconvention, called the platform, are heartily approved.\r\n\r\nWhile the resolution in regard to the supplanting of republican government\r\nupon the Western Continent is fully concurred in, there might be\r\nmisunderstanding were I not to say that the position of the Government in\r\nrelation to the action of France in Mexico, as assumed through the State\r\nDepartment and indorsed by the convention among the measures and acts of\r\nthe Executive, will be faithfully maintained so long as the state of facts\r\nshall leave that position pertinent and applicable.\r\n\r\nI am especially gratified that the soldier and seaman were not forgotten\r\nby the convention, as they forever must and will be remembered by the\r\ngrateful country for whose salvation they devote their lives.\r\n\r\nThanking you for the kind and complimentary terms in which you have\r\ncommunicated the nomination and other proceedings of the convention, I\r\nsubscribe myself,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL P. STEELE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 29, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL STEELE:\r\n\r\nI understand that Congress declines to admit to seats the persons sent as\r\nSenators and Representatives from Arkansas. These persons apprehend that,\r\nin consequence, you may not support the new State government there as you\r\notherwise would. My wish is that you give that government and the people\r\nthere the same support and protection that you would if the members had\r\nbeen admitted, because in no event, nor in any view of the case, can this\r\ndo any harm, while it will be the best you can do toward suppressing the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL GRANT. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point:\r\n\r\nDr. Worster wishes to visit you with a view of getting your permission to\r\nintroduce into the army \"Harmon's Sandal Sock.\" Shall I give him a pass\r\nfor that object?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO DAVID TOD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 30, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. DAVID TOD, Youngstown, Ohio: I have nominated you to be Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, in place of Governor Chase, who has resigned. Please come\r\nwithout a moment's delay.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. L. SCRIPPS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nTo JOHN L. SCRIPPS, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Complaint is made to me that you are using your official power\r\nto defeat Mr. Arnold's nomination to Congress. I am well satisfied with\r\nMr. Arnold as a member of Congress, and I do not know that the man who\r\nmight supplant him would be as satisfactory; but the correct principle,\r\nI think, is that all our friends should have absolute freedom of choice\r\namong our friends. My wish, therefore, is that you will do just as you\r\nthink fit with your own suffrage in the case, and not constrain any of\r\nyour subordinates to [do] other than [as] he thinks fit with his. This is\r\nprecisely the rule I inculcated and adhered to on my part, when a certain\r\nother nomination, now recently made, was being canvassed for.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. W. GARRETT. WASHINGTON, July 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nJ. W. GARRETT, President [B. & 0. R. R.], Camden Station:\r\n\r\nYou say telegraphic communication is re-established with Sandy Hook. Well,\r\nwhat does Sandy Hook say about operations of enemy and of Sigel during\r\nto-day?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, July 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR, Governor of New York, Albany:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to inform you that a rebel force, variously\r\nestimated at from fifteen to twenty thousand men, have invaded the State\r\nof Maryland, and have taken Martinsburg and Harper's Ferry, and are\r\nthreatening other points; that the public safety requires him to call\r\nupon the State executives for a militia force to repel this invasion. He\r\ntherefore directs me to call on you for a militia force of twelve thousand\r\nmen from your State to serve not more than one hundred days, and to\r\nrequest that you will with the utmost despatch forward the troops to\r\nWashington by rail or steamboat as may be most expeditious.\r\n\r\nPlease favor me with an answer at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION SUSPENDING THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS,\r\n\r\nJULY 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, by a proclamation which was issued on the 15th day of April,\r\n1861, the President of the United States announced and declared that the\r\nlaws of the United States had been for some time past, and then were,\r\nopposed and the execution thereof obstructed in certain States therein\r\nmentioned, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary\r\ncourse of judicial proceedings or by the power vested in the marshals by\r\nlaw; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation the land\r\nand naval forces of the United States were put into activity to suppress\r\nthe said insurrections and rebellion; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, the Congress of the United States, by an act approved on the\r\nthird day of March, 1863, did enact that during the said rebellion the\r\nPresident of the United States, whenever in his judgment the public safety\r\nmay require it, is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of\r\nhabeas corpus in any case throughout the United States, or any part\r\nthereof; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, the said insurrection and rebellion still continue, endangering\r\nthe existence of the Constitution and Government of the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, the military forces of the United States are now actively engaged\r\nin suppressing the said insurrection and rebellion in various parts of\r\nthe States where the said rebellion has been successful in obstructing\r\nthe laws and public authorities, especially in the States of Virginia and\r\nGeorgia; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, on the fifteenth day of September last, the President of the\r\nUnited States duly issued his proclamation, wherein he declared that the\r\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus should be suspended throughout\r\nthe United States, in Cases whereby the authority of the President of\r\nthe United States, the military, naval, and civil officers of the United\r\nStates, or any of them, hold persons under their command or in their\r\ncustody, either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the\r\nenemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted, or mustered,\r\nor enlisted in, or belonging to the land or naval forces of the United\r\nStates, or as deserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law,\r\nor the rules and articles of war, or the rules and regulations prescribed\r\nfor the military and naval service by authority of the President of the\r\nUnited States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offence against\r\nthe military or naval service; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, many citizens of the State of Kentucky have joined the forces of\r\nthe insurgents, who have on several occasions entered the said State\r\nof Kentucky in large force and not without aid and comfort furnished by\r\ndisaffected and disloyal citizens of the United States residing therein,\r\nhave not only greatly disturbed the public peace but have overborne the\r\ncivil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying property and\r\nlife in various parts of the State; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, it has been made known to the President of the United States, by\r\nthe officers commanding the National armies, that combinations have been\r\nformed in the said State of Kentucky, with a purpose of inciting the rebel\r\nforces to renew the said operations of civil war within the said State,\r\nand thereby to embarrass the United States armies now operating in the\r\nsaid States of Virginia and Georgia, and even to endanger their safety.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by\r\nvirtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws, do\r\nhereby declare that in my judgment the public safety especially requires\r\nthat the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus so\r\nproclaimed in the said proclamation of the 15th of September, 1863, be\r\nmade effectual and be duly enforced in and throughout the said State of\r\nKentucky, and that martial law be for the present declared therein. I do\r\ntherefore hereby require of the military officers of the said State that\r\nthe privilege of the habeas corpus be effectually suspended within the\r\nsaid State, according to the aforesaid proclamation, and that martial law\r\nbe established therein to take effect from the date of this proclamation,\r\nthe said suspension and establishment of martial law to continue until\r\nthis proclamation shall be revoked or modified, but not beyond the period\r\nwhen the said rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end. And\r\nI do hereby require and command, as well as military officers, all civil\r\nofficers and authorities existing or found within the said State of\r\nKentucky, to take notice of this proclamation and to give full effect\r\nto the same. The martial laws herein proclaimed and the things in that\r\nrespect herein ordered will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the\r\nholding of lawful elections, or with the proceedings of the constitutional\r\nLegislature of Kentucky, or with the administration of justice in the\r\ncourts of law existing therein between citizens of the United States in\r\nsuits or proceedings which do not affect the military operations or the\r\nconstituted authorities of the government of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the City of Washington this 5th day of July, in the year of our\r\nLord 1864, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. By the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION FOR A DAY OF PRAYER, JULY 7, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, the Senate and House of Representatives at their last session\r\nadopted a concurrent resolution, which was approved on the second day of\r\nJuly instant, and which `was in the words following, namely:\r\n\r\nThat the President of the United States be requested to appoint a day of\r\nhumiliation and prayer by the people of the United States, that he request\r\nhis constitutional advisers at the head of the Executive Departments\r\nto unite with him, as Chief Magistrate of the nation, at the City of\r\nWashington, and the members of Congress, and all magistrates, all civil,\r\nmilitary, and naval officers, all soldiers, sailors, and marines, with all\r\nloyal and law-abiding people, to convene at their usual places of worship,\r\nor wherever they may be, to confess and to repent of their manifold\r\nsins, to implore the compassion and forgiveness of the Almighty, that,\r\nif consistent with His will, the existing rebellion may be speedily\r\nsuppressed, and the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates may be established throughout all the States; to implore Him, as\r\nthe Supreme Ruler of the world, not to destroy us as a people, nor suffer\r\nus to be destroyed by the hostility or connivance of other nations, or by\r\nobstinate adhesion to our own counsels which may be in conflict with His\r\neternal, purposes, and to implore Him to enlighten the mind of the nation\r\nto know and do His will, humbly believing that it is in accordance with\r\nHis will that our place should be maintained as a united people among the\r\nfamily of nations; to implore Him to grant to our armed defenders, and\r\nthe masses of the people, that courage, power of resistance, and endurance\r\nnecessary to secure that result; to implore Him in His infinite goodness\r\nto soften the hearts, enlighten the minds, and quicken the conscience of\r\nthose in rebellion, that they may lay down their arms, and speedily return\r\nto their allegiance to the United States, that they may not be utterly\r\ndestroyed, that the effusion of blood may be stayed, and that unity and\r\nfraternity may be restored, and peace established throughout all our\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the `United States,\r\ncordially concurring with the Congress of the United States, in the\r\npenitential and pious sentiments expressed in the aforesaid resolutions,\r\nand heartily approving of the devotional design and purpose thereof, do\r\nhereby appoint the first Thursday of August next to be observed by the\r\npeople of the United States as a day of national humiliation and prayer.\r\n\r\nI do hereby further invite and request the heads of the Executive\r\nDepartments of this Government, together with all legislators, all judges\r\nand magistrates, and all other persons exercising authority in the land,\r\nwhether civil, military, or naval, and all soldiers, seamen, and marines\r\nin the national service, and all other loyal and law-abiding people of the\r\nUnited States, to assemble in their preferred places of public worship on\r\nthat day, and there to render to the Almighty and merciful Ruler of the\r\nUniverse, such homage and such confessions, and to offer to Him such\r\nsupplications as the Congress of the United States have, in their\r\naforesaid resolution, so solemnly, so earnestly, and so reverently\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal\r\nof the United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington this\r\nseventh day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred\r\nand sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the\r\neighty-ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 7th, with inclosures, received.\r\n\r\nIf you can find any person, anywhere, professing to have any proposition\r\nof Jefferson Davis in writing, for peace, embracing the restoration of the\r\nUnion and abandonment of slavery, whatever else it embraces, say to him he\r\nmay come to me with you; and that if he really brings such proposition,\r\nhe shall at the least have safe conduct with the paper (and without\r\npublicity, if he chooses) to the point where you shall have to meet him.\r\nThe same if there be two or more persons.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. W. GARRETT. WASHINGTON, D. C., July 9, 1864\r\n\r\nJ. W. GARRETT, Camden Station:\r\n\r\nWhat have you heard about a battle at Monocacy to-day? We have nothing\r\nabout it here except what you say.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM GENERAL HALLECK TO GENERAL WALLACE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 9, 1864. 11.57 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL L. WALLACE, Commanding Middle Department:\r\n\r\nI am directed by the President to say that you will rally your forces and\r\nmake every possible effort to retard the enemy's march on Baltimore.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, Major-General and Chief of Staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO T. SWAN AND OTHERS. WASHINGTON, D. C., July 10, 1864. 9.20\r\nA.M.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SWAN AND OTHERS, Baltimore, Maryland:\r\n\r\nYours of last night received. I have not a single soldier but whom is\r\nbeing disposed by the military for the best protection of all. By latest\r\naccounts the enemy is moving on Washington. They cannot fly to either\r\nplace. Let us be vigilant, but keep cool. I hope neither Baltimore nor\r\nWashington will be sacked.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. WASHINGTON CITY, July TO, 1864.2 P.M.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nYour dispatch to General Halleck, referring to what I may think in the\r\npresent emergency, is shown me. General Halleck says we have absolutely no\r\nforce here fit to go to the field. He thinks that with the hundred-day\r\nmen and invalids we have here we can defend Washington, and, scarcely,\r\nBaltimore. Besides these there are about eight thousand, not very\r\nreliable, under Howe, at Harper's Ferry with Hunter approaching that point\r\nvery slowly, with what number I suppose you know better than I. Wallace,\r\nwith some odds and ends, and part of what came up with Ricketts, was so\r\nbadly beaten yesterday at Monocacy, that what is left can attempt no more\r\nthan to defend Baltimore. What we shall get in from Pennsylvania and New\r\nYork will scarcely be worth counting, I fear. Now, what I think is, that\r\nyou should provide to retain your hold where you are, certainly, and bring\r\nthe rest with you personally, and make a vigorous effort to destroy the\r\nenemy's forces in this vicinity. I think there is really a fair chance\r\nto do this, if the movement is prompt. This is what I think upon your\r\nsuggestion, and is not an order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, July 11, 1864. 8 A.M.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nYours of 10.30 P.M. yesterday received, and very satisfactory. The enemy\r\nwill learn of Wright's arrival, and then the difficulty will be to unite\r\nWright and Hunter south of the enemy before he will recross the Potomac.\r\nSome firing between Rockville and here now.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D. C., July 12, 1864. 11.30\r\nAM.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nVague rumors have been reaching us for two or three days that Longstreet's\r\ncorps is also on its way [to] this vicinity. Look out for its absence from\r\nyour front.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM AND LETTER TO HORACE GREELEY. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July\r\n12, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. HORACE GREELEY, New York:\r\n\r\nI suppose you received my letter of the 9th. I have just received yours of\r\nthe 13th, and am disappointed by it. I was not expecting you to send me a\r\nletter, but to bring me a man, or men. Mr. Hay goes to you with my answer\r\nto yours of the 13th.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Carried by Major John Hay.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, JULY 15, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:-Yours of the 13th is just received, and I am disappointed\r\nthat you have not already reached here with those commissioners, if they\r\nwould consent to come on being shown my letter to you of the 9th instant.\r\nShow that and this to them, and if they will come on the terms stated in\r\nthe former, bring them. I not only intend a sincere effort for peace, but\r\nI intend that you shall be a personal witness that it is made.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFE CONDUCT FOR CLEMENT C. CLAY AND OTHERS,\r\n\r\nJULY 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States directs that the four persons whose\r\nnames follow, to wit, HON. Clement C. Clay, HON. Jacob Thompson, Professor\r\nJames P. Holcombe, George N. Sanders, shall have safe conduct to the city\r\nof Washington in company with the HON. HORACE GREELEY, and shall be exempt\r\nfrom arrest or annoyance of any kind from any officer of the United States\r\nduring their journey to the said city of Washington.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President: JOHN HAY, Major and Assistant Adjutant-General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. [WASHINGTON] July 17. 1864. 11.25 A.M.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nIn your dispatch of yesterday to General Sherman, I find the following, to\r\nwit:\r\n\r\n\"I shall make a desperate effort to get a position here, which will hold\r\nthe enemy without the necessity of so many men.\"\r\n\r\nPressed as we are by lapse of time I am glad to hear you say this; and yet\r\nI do hope you may find a way that the effort shall not be desperate in the\r\nsense of great loss of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL D. HUNTER WASHINGTON JULY 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER, Harper's Ferry, West Va.\r\n\r\nYours of this morning received. You misconceive. The order you complain of\r\nwas only nominally mine, and was framed by those who really made it with\r\nno thought of making you a scapegoat. It seemed to be General Grant's wish\r\nthat the forces under General Wright and those under you should join and\r\ndrive at the enemy under General Wright. Wright had the larger part of the\r\nforce, but you had the rank. It was thought that you would prefer Crook's\r\ncommanding your part to your serving in person under Wright. That is all\r\nof it. General Grant wishes you to remain in command of the department,\r\nand I do not wish to order otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 18, 1864. 11.25 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Chattahoochee River, Georgia:\r\n\r\nI have seen your despatches objecting to agents of Northern States opening\r\nrecruiting stations near your camps. An act of Congress authorizes this,\r\ngiving the appointment of agents to the States, and not to the Executive\r\nGovernment. It is not for the War Department, or myself, to restrain\r\nor modify the law, in its execution, further than actual necessity may\r\nrequire. To be candid, I was for the passage of the law, not apprehending\r\nat the time that it would produce such inconvenience to the armies in the\r\nfield as you now cause me to fear. Many of the States were very anxious\r\nfor it, and I hoped that, with their State bounties, and active exertions,\r\nthey would get out substantial additions to our colored forces, which,\r\nunlike white recruits, help us where they come from, as well as where they\r\ngo to. I still hope advantage from the law; and being a law, it must be\r\ntreated as such by all of us. We here will do what we consistently can to\r\nsave you from difficulties arising out of it. May I ask, therefore, that\r\nyou will give your hearty co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Volunteers will be\r\naccepted under this call for one, two, or three years, as they may elect,\r\nand will be entitled to the bounty provided by the law for the period of\r\nservices for which they enlist.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby proclaim, order, and direct that immediately after the 5th\r\nday of September, 1864, being fifty days from the date of this call,\r\na draft for troops to serve for one year shall be had in every town,\r\ntownship, ward of a city, precinct, or election district, or county not\r\nso subdivided, to fill the quota which shall be assigned to it under this\r\ncall or any part thereof which may be unfilled by volunteers on the said\r\n5th day of September, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the City of Washington, this 18th day of July, A.D. 1864, and of\r\nthe independence of the United States the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

SNIDER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN:\r\n\r\nHerewith is the manuscript letter for the gentleman who sent me a cane\r\nthrough your hands. For my life I cannot make out his name; and therefore\r\nI cut it from his letter and pasted it on, as you see. I suppose [sic]\r\nwill remember who he is, and I will thank you to forward him the letter.\r\nHe dates his letter at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENTATION OF A CANE\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM O. SNIDER:\r\n\r\nThe cane you did me the honor to present through Governor Curtin was duly\r\nplaced in my hand by him. Please accept my thanks; and, at the same time,\r\npardon me for not having sooner found time to tender them. Your obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOHN HAY TO J. C. WELLING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON. July 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nJ. C. WELLING, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSIR:--According to the request contained in your note, I have placed Mr.\r\nGibson's letter of resignation in the hands of the President. He has read\r\nthe letter, and says he accepts the resignation, as he will be glad to\r\ndo with any other, which may be tendered, as this is, for the purpose of\r\ntaking an attitude of hostility against him.\r\n\r\nHe says he was not aware that he was so much indebted to Mr. Gibson for\r\nhaving accepted the office at first, not remembering that he ever pressed\r\nhim to do so, or that he gave it otherwise than as was usual, upon request\r\nmade on behalf of Mr. Gibson.\r\n\r\nHe thanks Mr. Gibson for his acknowledgment that he has been treated with\r\npersonal kindness and consideration, and says he knows of but two small\r\ndrawbacks upon Mr. Gibson's right to still receive such treatment, one\r\nof which is that he never could learn of his giving much attention to\r\nthe duties of his office, and the other is this studied attempt of Mr.\r\nGibson's to stab him.\r\n\r\nI am very truly,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN HAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL, FIRST N. Y. VETERAN CAVALRY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, JULY 25, 1864.\r\n\r\nThomas Connor, a private in the First Veteran New York Cavalry, is now\r\nimprisoned at hard labor for desertion. If the Colonel of said Regiment\r\nwill say in writing on this sheets that he is willing to receive him back\r\nto the Regiment, I will pardon, and send him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 26, 1864. 2.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, near Atlanta:\r\n\r\nI have just seen yours complaining of the appointment of Hovey and\r\nOsterhaus. The point you make is unquestionably a good one, and yet\r\nplease hear a word from us. My recollection is that both General Grant\r\nand yourself recommended both H [ovey] and O [sterhaus] for promotion, and\r\nthese, with other strong recommendations, drew committals from us which we\r\ncould neither honorably or safely disregard. We blamed H [ovey] for coming\r\naway in the manner in which he did, but he knew he had apparent reason to\r\nfeel disappointed and mortified, and we felt it was not best to crush one\r\nwho certainly had been a good soldier. As to [Osterhaus], we did not know\r\nof his leaving at the time we made the appointment, and do not now\r\nknow the terms on which he left. Not to have appointed him, as the case\r\nappeared to us at the time, would have been almost, if not quite, a\r\nviolation of our word. The word was given on what we thought was high\r\nmerit and somewhat on his nationality. I beg you to believe we do not act\r\nin a spirit of disregarding merit. We expect to await your programme for\r\nfurther changes and promotions in your army. My profoundest thanks to you\r\nand your whole army for the present campaign so far.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, July 27, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army:\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--Lieutenant-General Grant having signified that, owing to the\r\ndifficulties and delay of communication between his headquarters and\r\nWashington, it is necessary that in the present emergency military orders\r\nmust be issued directly from Washington, the President directs me to\r\ninstruct you that all the military operations for the defense of the\r\nMiddle Department, the Department of the Susquehanna, the Department of\r\nWashington, and the Department of West Virginia, and all the forces in\r\nthose departments, are placed under your general command, and that you\r\nwill be expected to take all military measures necessary for defense\r\nagainst any attack of the enemy and for his capture and destruction.\r\nYou will issue from time to time such orders to the commanders of the\r\nrespective departments and to the military authorities therein as may be\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON. WASHINGTON, July 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR JOHNSON, Nashville, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nYours in relation to General A. C. Gillam just received. Will look after\r\nthe matter to-day.\r\n\r\nI also received yours about General Carl Schurz. I appreciate him\r\ncertainly, as highly as you do; but you can never know until you have the\r\ntrial, how difficult it is to find a place for an officer of so high rank\r\nwhen there is no place seeking him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Mrs. ANNE WILLIAMSON,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nMrs. ANNE WILLIAMSON.\r\n\r\nMADAM:--The plaid you send me is just now placed in my hands. I thank you\r\nfor that pretty and useful present, but still more for those good wishes\r\nfor myself and our country, which prompted you to present it.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT, AUGUST 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, August 2, 1864.\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:--This note will introduce to you Mr. Schley of Baltimore,\r\nwho desires to appeal to you for the revocation of an order of General\r\nHunter, removing some persons, citizens of Frederick, beyond his lines,\r\nand imprisoning others. This Department has no information of the reasons\r\nor proofs on which General Hunter acts, and I do not therefore feel\r\nat liberty to suspend or interfere with his action except under your\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nAugust 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War will suspend the order of General Hunter mentioned\r\nwithin, until further order and direct him to send to the Department a\r\nbrief report of what is known against each one proposed to be dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U, S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n(Cipher.)\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C.. August 3, 1864\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nI have seen your despatch in which you say, \"I want Sheridan put in\r\ncommand of all the troops in the field, with instructions to put himself\r\nsouth of the enemy, and follow him to the death. Wherever the enemy goes,\r\nlet our troops go also.\"\r\n\r\nThis, I think, is exactly right as to how our forces should move; but\r\nplease look over the despatches you may have received from here, ever\r\nsince you made that order, and discover, if you can, that there is any\r\nidea in the head of any one here of \"putting our army south of the enemy,\"\r\nor of following him to the \"death,\" in any direction. I repeat to you,\r\nit will neither be done nor attempted, unless you watch it every day and\r\nhour, and force it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n     [Here the President was mistaken in thinking that Sherman,\r\n     Sheridan, and Grant had the same inability of most of his\r\n     previous general officers.  No one needed to watch Grant or\r\n     Sherman or Sheridan, they only needed to get out of their\r\n     way.

HORACE GREELEY, New York:\r\n\r\nYours to Major Hay about publication of our correspondence received. With\r\nthe suppression of a few passages in your letters in regard to which I\r\nthink you and I would not disagree, I should be glad of the publication.\r\nPlease come over and see me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 8, 1864\r\n\r\nHON. HORACE GREELEY, New York:\r\n\r\nI telegraphed you Saturday. Did you receive the despatch? Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON DISLOYAL FAMILY MEMBER\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. O. BURBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 8, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURBRIDGE, Lexington, Ky.:\r\n\r\nLast December Mrs. Emily T. Helm, half-sister of Mrs. Lincoln, and widow\r\nof the rebel general, Ben Hardin Helm, stopped here on her way from\r\nGeorgia to Kentucky, and I gave her a paper, as I remember, to protect her\r\nagainst the mere fact of her being General Helm's widow. I hear a rumor\r\nto-day that you recently sought to arrest her, but were prevented by her\r\npresenting the paper from me. I do not intend to protect her against the\r\nconsequences of disloyal words or acts, spoken or done by her since her\r\nreturn to Kentucky, and if the paper given her by me can be construed\r\nto give her protection for such words and acts, it is hereby revoked pro\r\ntanto. Deal with her for current conduct just as you would with any other.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 14, 1864. 1.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War and I concur that you had better confer with General\r\nLee, and stipulate for a mutual discontinuance of house-burning and other\r\ndestruction of private property. The time and manner of conference and\r\nparticulars of stipulation we leave, on our part, to your convenience and\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 15,1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, near Atlanta, Ga.:\r\n\r\nIf the Government should purchase, on its own account, cotton northward of\r\nyou, and on the line of your communications, would it be an inconvenience\r\nto you, or detriment to the military service, for it to come to the north\r\non the railroad?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW WITH JOHN T. MILLS,\r\n\r\nAUGUST [15?], 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President,\" said Governor Randall, \"why can't you seek seclusion, and\r\nplay hermit for a fortnight? It would reinvigorate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the President, \"two or three weeks would do me no good. I\r\ncannot fly from my thoughts--my solicitude for this great country follows\r\nme wherever I go. I do not think it is personal vanity or ambition, though\r\nI am not free from these infirmities, but I cannot but feel that the\r\nweal or woe of this great nation will be decided in November. There is no\r\nprogram offered by any wing of the Democratic party but that must result\r\nin the permanent destruction of the Union.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. President, General McClellan is in favor of crushing out this\r\nrebellion by force. He will be the Chicago candidate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the slightest knowledge of arithmetic will prove to any man that\r\nthe rebel armies cannot be destroyed by Democratic strategy. It would\r\nsacrifice all the white men of the North to do it. There are now in\r\nthe service of the United States nearly one hundred and fifty thousand\r\nable-bodied colored men, most of them under arms, defending and acquiring\r\nUnion territory. The Democratic strategy demands that these forces be\r\ndisbanded, and that the masters be conciliated by restoring them to\r\nslavery. The black men who now assist Union prisoners to escape are to be\r\nconverted into our enemies, in the vain hope of gaining the good-will of\r\ntheir masters. We shall have to fight two nations instead of one.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot conciliate the South if you guarantee to them ultimate\r\nsuccess; and the experience of the present war proves their success is\r\ninevitable if you fling the compulsory labor of millions of black men\r\ninto their side of the scale. Will you give our enemies such military\r\nadvantages as insure success, and then depend on coaxing, flattery, and\r\nconcession to get them back into the Union? Abandon all the posts now\r\ngarrisoned by black men, take one hundred and fifty thousand men from our\r\nside and put them in the battle-field or corn-field against us, and we\r\nwould be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks.\r\n\r\n\"We have to hold territory in inclement and sickly places; where are the\r\nDemocrats to do this? It was a free fight, and the field was open to the\r\nwar Democrats to put down this rebellion by fighting against both master\r\nand slave, long before the present policy was inaugurated.\r\n\r\n\"There have been men base enough to propose to me to return to slavery the\r\nblack warriors of Port Hudson and Olustee, and thus win the respect of the\r\nmasters they fought. Should I do so, I should deserve to be damned in time\r\nand eternity. Come what will, I will keep my faith with friend and foe.\r\nMy enemies pretend I am now carrying on this war for the sole purpose of\r\nabolition. So long as I am President, it shall be carried on for the\r\nsole purpose of restoring the Union. But no human power can subdue this\r\nrebellion without the use of the emancipation policy, and every other\r\npolicy calculated to weaken the moral and physical forces of the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\n\"Freedom has given us one hundred and fifty thousand men, raised on\r\nSouthern soil. It will give us more yet. Just so much it has subtracted\r\nfrom the enemy, and, instead of alienating the South, there are now\r\nevidences of a fraternal feeling growing up between our men and the rank\r\nand file of the rebel soldiers. Let my enemies prove to the country that\r\nthe destruction of slavery is not necessary to a restoration of the Union.\r\nI will abide the issue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDORSEMENT OF APPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT, AUGUST 15, 1864.\r\n\r\nI am always for the man who wishes to work; and I shall be glad for this\r\nman to get suitable employment at Cavalry Depot, or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. J. RAYMOND.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, August 15, 1864\r\n\r\nHON. HENRY J. RAYMOND.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have proposed to Mr. Greeley that the Niagara\r\ncorrespondence be published, suppressing only the parts of his letters\r\nover which the red pencil is drawn in the copy which I herewith send. He\r\ndeclines giving his consent to the publication of his letters unless these\r\nparts be published with the rest. I have concluded that it is better for\r\nme to submit, for the time, to the consequences of the false position\r\nin which I consider he has placed me, than to subject the country to the\r\nconsequences of publishing these discouraging and injurious parts. I send\r\nyou this, and the accompanying copy, not for publication, but merely to\r\nexplain to you, and that you may preserve them until their proper time\r\nshall come.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nI have seen your despatch expressing your unwillingness to break your hold\r\nwhere you are. Neither am I willing. Hold on with a bulldog grip, and chew\r\nand choke as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING COMMERCIAL REGULATIONS, AUGUST 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas the act of Congress of the 28th of September, 1850, entitled \"An\r\nact to create additional collection districts in the State of California,\r\nand to change the existing districts therein, and to modify the existing\r\ncollection districts in the United States,\" extends to merchandise\r\nwarehoused under bond the privilege of being exported to the British North\r\nAmerican provinces adjoining the United States, in the manner prescribed\r\nin the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1845, which designates certain\r\nfrontier ports through which merchandise may be exported, and further\r\nprovides \"that such other ports, situated on the frontiers of the United\r\nStates adjoining the British North American provinces, as may hereafter\r\nbe found expedient, may have extended to them the like privileges, on the\r\nrecommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, and proclamation duly\r\nmade by the President of the United States, specially designating the\r\nports to which the aforesaid privileges are to be extended.\"\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, do hereby declare and proclaim that the port of Newport, in the\r\nState of Vermont, is and shall be entitled to all the privileges in regard\r\nto the exportation of merchandise in bond to the British North American\r\nprovinces adjoining the United States, which are extended to the ports\r\nenumerated in the seventh section of the act of Congress of the 3d of\r\nMarch, 1845, aforesaid, from and after the date of this proclamation.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this\r\neighteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States of\r\nAmerica, the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT CONCERNING AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS, AUGUST 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nIf General Hitchcock can effect a special exchange of Thomas D. Armesy,\r\nnow under conviction as a spy, or something of the sort, and in prison\r\nat for Major Nathan Goff, made a prisoner of war, and now in prison at\r\nRichmond, let it be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE 164TH OHIO REGIMENT,\r\n\r\nAUGUST 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS:--You are about to return to your homes and your friends, after\r\nhaving, as I learn, performed in camp a comparatively short term of duty\r\nin this great contest. I am greatly obliged to you, and to all who\r\nhave come forward at the call of their country. I wish it might be more\r\ngenerally and universally understood what the country is now engaged in.\r\nWe have, as all will agree, a free government, where every man has a right\r\nto be equal with every other man. In this great struggle, this form of\r\ngovernment and every form of human right is endangered if our enemies\r\nsucceed. There is more involved in this contest than is realized by\r\nevery one. There is involved in this struggle, the question whether your\r\nchildren and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed. I say\r\nthis, in order to impress upon you, if you are not already so impressed,\r\nthat no small matter should divert us from our great purpose.\r\n\r\nThere may be some inequalities in the practical application of our system.\r\nIt is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value\r\nof his property; but if we should wait, before collecting a tax, to adjust\r\nthe taxes upon each man in exact proportion with every other man, we\r\nshould never collect any tax at all. There may be mistakes made sometimes;\r\nand things may be done wrong, while the officers of the Government do all\r\nthey can to prevent mistakes. But I beg of you, as citizens of this great\r\nRepublic, not to let your minds be carried off from the great work we have\r\nbefore us. This struggle is too large for you to be diverted from it by\r\nany small matter. When you return to your homes, rise up to the height of\r\na generation of men worthy of a free government, and we will carry out the\r\ngreat work we have commenced. I return to you my sincere thanks, soldiers,\r\nfor the honor you have done me this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTLER. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August\r\n20, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTLER, Bermuda Hundred, Va.:\r\n\r\nPlease allow Judge Snead to go to his family on Eastern Shore, or give me\r\nsome good reason why not.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE 166TH OHIO REGIMENT,\r\n\r\nAUGUST 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS--I suppose you are going home to see your families and friends.\r\nFor the services you have done in this great struggle in which we are\r\nengaged, I present you sincere thanks for myself and the country.\r\n\r\nI almost always feel inclined, when I say anything to soldiers, to impress\r\nupon them, in a few brief remarks, the importance of success in this\r\ncontest. It is not merely for the day, but for all time to come, that\r\nwe should perpetuate for our children's children that great and free\r\ngovernment which we have enjoyed all our lives. I beg you to remember\r\nthis, not merely for my sake, but for yours. I happen, temporarily, to\r\noccupy this big White House. I am a living witness that any one of your\r\nchildren may look to come here as my father's child has. It is in order\r\nthat each one of you may have, through this free government which we have\r\nenjoyed, an open field, and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise,\r\nand intelligence; that you may all have equal privileges in the race of\r\nlife with all its desirable human aspirations--it is for this that the\r\nstruggle should be maintained, that we may not lose our birthrights--not\r\nonly for one, but for two or three years, if necessary. The nation is\r\nworth fighting for, to secure such an inestimable jewel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 23, 1864.\r\n\r\nThis morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that\r\nthis administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to\r\nso co-operate with the President-elect as to save the Union between the\r\nelection and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on\r\nsuch ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 26,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR JOHNSON, Nashville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nThanks to General Gillam for making the news and also to you for sending\r\nit. Does Joe Heiskell's \"walking to meet us\" mean any more than that \"Joe\"\r\nwas scared and wanted to save his skin?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO B. H. BREWSTER. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August\r\n30,1864.\r\n\r\nHON. B. H. BREWSTER, Astor House, New York:\r\n\r\nYour letter of yesterday received. Thank you for it.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING COTTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 31, 1864.\r\n\r\nAny person or persons engaged in bringing out cotton, in strict conformity\r\nwith authority given by W. P. Fessenden, Secretary of the United States\r\nTreasury, must not be hindered by the War, Navy, or any other Department\r\nof the Government, or any person engaged under any of said Departments.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUIDEKOPER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, SEPTEMBER 1, 1864\r\n\r\nCOLONEL H. C. HUIDEKOPER, Meadville, Penn.\r\n\r\nSIR: It is represented to me that there are at Rock Island, Illinois, as\r\nrebel prisoners of war, many persons of Northern and foreign birth who are\r\nunwilling to be exchanged and sent South, but who wish to take the oath\r\nof allegiance and enter the military service of the Union. Colonel\r\nHuidekoper, on behalf of the people of some parts of Pennsylvania, wishes\r\nto pay the bounties the Government would have to pay to proper persons\r\nof this class, have them enter the service of the United States, and be\r\ncredited to the localities furnishing the bounty money. He will therefore\r\nproceed to Rock Island, ascertain the names of such persons (not\r\nincluding any who have attractions Southward), and telegraph them to\r\nthe Provost-Marshal-General here, whereupon direction will be given to\r\ndischarge the persons named upon their taking the oath of allegiance; and\r\nthen upon the official evidence being furnished that they shall have been\r\nduly received and mustered into the service of the United States, their\r\nnumber will be credited as may be directed by Colonel Huidekoper.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Sherman and the gallant officers and soldiers of his command before\r\nAtlanta, for the distinguished ability, courage, and perseverance\r\ndisplayed in the campaign in Georgia, which under Divine power resulted\r\nin the capture of the city of Atlanta. The marches, battles, sieges, and\r\nother military operations that have signalized this campaign must\r\nrender it famous in the annals of war, and have entitled those who have\r\nparticipated therein to the applause and thanks of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

GURNEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nELIZA P. GURNEY.\r\n\r\nMY ESTEEMED FRIEND:--I have not forgotten probably never shall forget the\r\nvery impressive occasion when yourself and friends visited me on a Sabbath\r\nforenoon two years ago--nor has your kind letter, written nearly a\r\nyear later, even been for gotten. In all, it has been your purpose to\r\nstrengthen my reliance on God. I am much indebted to the good Christian\r\npeople of the country for their constant prayer and consolations; and to\r\nno one of them, more than to yourself. The purposes of the Almighty are\r\nperfect, and must prevail, though we erring mortals may fail to accurately\r\nperceive them in advance. We hoped for a happy termination of this\r\nterrible war long before this; but God knows best, and has ruled\r\notherwise. We shall yet acknowledge His wisdom, and our own error therein.\r\nMean while we must work earnestly in the best light He gives us, trusting\r\nthat so working still conduces to the great ends He ordains. Surely He\r\nintends some great good to follow this mighty convulsion, which no mortal\r\ncould make, and no mortal could stay.\r\n\r\nYour people--the Friends--have had, and are having, a very great trial.\r\nOn principle, and faith, opposed to both war and oppression, they can\r\nonly practically oppose oppression by war. For those appealing to me on\r\nconscientious grounds, I have done, and shall do, the best I could and\r\ncan, in my own conscience, under my oath to the law. That you believe this\r\nI doubt not, and believing it, I shall still receive, for our country and\r\nmyself your earnest prayers to our Father in Heaven.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A COMMITTEE OF COLORED PEOPLE FROM BALTIMORE\r\n\r\nWHO PRESENTED HIM WITH A BIBLE,\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 7, 1864.\r\n\r\nI can only say now, as I have often said before, it has always been a\r\nsentiment with me, that all mankind should be free. So far as I have been\r\nable, so far as came within my sphere, I have always acted as I believed\r\nwas just and right, and done all I could for the good of mankind. I have,\r\nin letters sent forth from this office, expressed myself better than I can\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the great Book, I have only to say it is the best gift which\r\nGod has ever given to man. All the good from the Saviour of the world is\r\ncommunicated to us through this book. But for that Book, we could not know\r\nright from wrong. All those things desirable to man are contained in it. I\r\nreturn you sincere thanks for this very elegant copy of this great Book of\r\nGod which you present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR PICKERING.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 8, 1864:\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR PICKERING, Olympia, W. T.:\r\n\r\nYour patriotic despatch of yesterday received and will be published.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF THANKS TO HUNDRED-DAY TROOPS FROM OHIO.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY, September 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe term of one hundred days for which the National Guard of Ohio\r\nvolunteered having expired, the President directs an official\r\nacknowledgment to be made of their patriotic and valuable services during\r\nthe recent campaigns. The term of service of their enlistment was short,\r\nbut distinguished by memorable events. In the Valley of the Shenandoah, on\r\nthe Peninsula, in the operations on the James River, around Petersburg\r\nand Richmond, in the battle of Monocacy, and in the intrenchments of\r\nWashington, and in other important service, the National Guard of Ohio\r\nperformed with alacrity the duty of patriotic volunteers, for which they\r\nare entitled to and are hereby tendered, through the Governor of their\r\nState, the national thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 12, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nSheridan and Early are facing each other at a dead-lock. Could we not pick\r\nup a regiment here and there, to the number of say ten thousand men, and\r\nquietly but suddenly concentrate them at Sheridan's camp and enable him to\r\nmake a strike?\r\n\r\nThis is but a suggestion.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO JAMES G. BLAINE. WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September\r\n13, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. J. G. BLAINE, Augusta, Me.: On behalf of the Union, thanks to Maine.\r\nThanks to you personally for sending the news.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--Send same to L. B. Smith and M. A. Blanchard, Portland, Me. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September\r\n13, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Saint Louis:\r\n\r\nPostpone the execution of S. H. Anderson for two weeks. Hear what his\r\nfriends can say in mitigation and report to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nMAJOR ECKERT: Please send the above telegram.\r\n\r\nJNO. G. NICOLAY, Private Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SLOUGH.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SLOUGH, Alexandria, Va.:\r\n\r\nOn the 14th I commuted the sentence of Conley, but fearing you may not\r\nhave received notice I send this. Do not execute him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN. WASHINGTON, D. C., September 17,1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Atlanta, Georgia:\r\n\r\nI feel great interest in the subjects of your despatch mentioning corn and\r\nsorghum, and the contemplated visit to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 19, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nThe State election of Indiana occurs on the 11th of October, and the loss\r\nof it to the friends of the Government would go far towards losing\r\nthe whole Union cause. The bad effect upon the November election, and\r\nespecially the giving the State government to those who will oppose the\r\nwar in every possible way, are too much to risk if it can be avoided. The\r\ndraft proceeds, notwithstanding its strong tendency to lose us the State.\r\nIndiana is the only important State voting in October whose soldiers\r\ncannot vote in the field. Anything you can safely do to let her soldiers\r\nor any part of them go home and vote at the State election will be greatly\r\nin point. They need not remain for the Presidential election, but may\r\nreturn to you at once. This is in no sense an order, but is merely\r\nintended to impress you with the importance to the Army itself of your\r\ndoing all you safely can, yourself being the judge of what you can safely\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT CONCERNING AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS, SEPTEMBER 1864.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this, who appeals for his brother, is our minister to\r\nEcuador, and whom, if at all compatible, I would like to have obliged by a\r\nspecial exchange of his brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL P. SHERIDAN. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September\r\n20, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Winchester, Va.:\r\n\r\nHave just heard of your great victory. God bless you all, officers and\r\nmen. Strongly inclined to come up and See you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL HITCHCOCK,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 21, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HITCHCOCK:\r\n\r\nPlease see the bearer, Mr. Broadwell, on a question about a mutual\r\nsupplying of clothes to prisoners.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nI send this as an explanation to you, and to do justice to the Secretary\r\nof War. I was induced, upon pressing application, to authorize the agents\r\nof one of the districts of Pennsylvania to recruit in one of the prison\r\ndepots in Illinois; and the thing went so far before it came to the\r\nknowledge of the Secretary that, in my judgment, it could not be abandoned\r\nwithout greater evil than would follow its going through. I did not know\r\nat the time that you had protested against that class of thing being done;\r\nand I now say that while this particular job must be completed, no other\r\nof the sort will be authorized, without an understanding with you, if at\r\nall. The Secretary of War is wholly free of any part in this blunder.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO POSTMASTER-GENERAL BLAIR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 23, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nHON. MONTGOMERY BLAIR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--You have generously said to me, more than once, that\r\nwhenever your resignation could be a relief to me, it was at my disposal.\r\nThe time has come. You very well know that this proceeds from no\r\ndissatisfaction of mine with you personally or officially. Your uniform\r\nkindness has been unsurpassed by that of any other friend, and while it\r\nis true that the war does not so greatly add to the difficulties of your\r\ndepartment as to those of some others, it is yet much to say, as I most\r\ntruly can, that in the three years and a half during which you have\r\nadministered the General Post-Office, I remember no single complaint\r\nagainst you in connection therewith.\r\n\r\nYours, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS IN INSURRECTIONARY STATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, September 24, 1864.\r\n\r\nI.

C., September 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Atlanta, Georgia:\r\n\r\nYou say Jefferson Davis is on a visit to Hood. I judge that Brown and\r\nStephens are the objects of his visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D.C., September 29,1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nI hope it will have no constraint on you, nor do harm any way, for me to\r\nsay I am a little afraid lest Lee sends reinforcements to Early, and thus\r\nenables him to turn upon Sheridan.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT.\r\n\r\nSeptember 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nI think the bearer of this, Second Lieutenant Albee, deserves a hearing.\r\nWill the Secretary of War please accord it to him?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER RETURNING THANKS TO THE VOLUNTEERS FOR ONE HUNDRED DAYS\r\n\r\nFROM THE STATES OF INDIANA, ILLINOIS, IOWA, AND WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, October 1, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe term of one hundred days for which volunteers from the States of\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin volunteered, under the call of\r\ntheir respective governors, in the months of May and June, to aid in the\r\ncampaign of General Sherman, having expired; the President directs an\r\nofficial acknowledgment to be made of their patriotic service. It was\r\ntheir good fortune to render efficient service in the brilliant operations\r\nin the Southwest and to contribute to the victories of the national arms\r\nover the rebel forces in Georgia under command of Johnston and Hood. On\r\nall occasions and in every service to which they were assigned their duty\r\nas patriotic volunteers was performed with alacrity and courage, for which\r\nthey are entitled to and are hereby tendered the national thanks through\r\nthe governors of their respective States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War is directed to transmit a copy of this order to\r\nthe governors of Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin and to cause a\r\ncertificate of their honorable service to be delivered to the officers\r\nand soldiers of the States above named who recently served in the military\r\nforce of the United States as volunteers for one hundred days.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 5, 1864\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nI inclose you a copy of a correspondence in regard to a contemplated\r\nexchange of naval prisoners through your lines, and not very distant from\r\nyour headquarters. It only came to the knowledge of the War Department and\r\nof myself yesterday, and it gives us some uneasiness. I therefore send it\r\nto you with the statement that, as the numbers to be exchanged under it\r\nare small, and so much has already been done to effect the exchange, I\r\nhope you may find it consistent to let it go forward under the general\r\nsupervision of General Butler, and particularly in reference to the points\r\nhe holds vital in exchanges. Still, you are at liberty to arrest the whole\r\noperation if in your judgment the public good requires it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT ON A MEMORANDUM BY GENERAL McDOWELL, OCTOBER 7, 1864\r\n\r\nI well remember the meetings herein narrated. See nothing for me to object\r\nto in the narrative as being made by General McDowell, except the phrase\r\nattributed to me \"of the Jacobinism of Congress\",\r\n\r\n     [This memorandum describes the private discussions that\r\n     preceded the transfer of McClellan's army from the Potomac,\r\n     where it had confronted the Confederates at Manassas. See H.\r\n     J. Raymond: Life of Lincoln, p. 772]\r\n\r\nwhich phrase I do not remember using literally or in substance, and which\r\nI wish not to be published in any event.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. W. HOFFMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, October 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nHON. HENRY W. HOFFMAN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--A convention of Maryland has framed a new constitution for\r\nthe State; a public meeting is called for this evening at Baltimore to aid\r\nin securing its ratification by the people, and you ask a word from me\r\nfor the occasion. I presume the only feature of the instrument about which\r\nthere is serious controversy is that which provides for the extinction of\r\nslavery. It needs not to be a secret and I presume it is no secret, that I\r\nwish success to this provision. I desire it on every consideration. I wish\r\nall men to be free. I wish the material prosperity of the already free,\r\nwhich I feel sure the extinction of slavery would bring. I wish to see in\r\nprocess of disappearing that only thing which ever could bring this nation\r\nto civil war. I attempt no argument. Argument upon the question is already\r\nexhausted by the abler, better informed, and more immediately interested\r\nsons of Maryland herself. I only add that I shall be gratified exceedingly\r\nif the good people of the State shall, by their votes, ratify the new\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 10, 1864, 5 P.M.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pa.:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day just this moment received, and the Secretary having left\r\nit is impossible for me to answer to-day. I have not received your letter\r\nfrom Erie.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO ROBERT T. LINCOLN, Cambridge, Mass.:\r\n\r\nYour letter makes us a little uneasy about your health. Telegraph us how\r\nyou are. If you think it would help you, make us a visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D. C., October 12, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nSecretary of War not being in, I answer yours about election. Pennsylvania\r\nvery close, and still in doubt on home vote. Ohio largely for us, with\r\nall the members of Congress but two or three. Indiana largely for\r\nus,--Governor, it is said, by fifteen thousand, and eight of the eleven\r\nmembers of Congress. Send us what you may know of your army vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE,\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 19, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--I am notified that this is a compliment paid\r\nme by the loyal Marylanders resident in this District. I infer that the\r\nadoption of the new constitution for the State furnishes the occasion, and\r\nthat in your view the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief\r\nmerit of the new constitution. Most heartily do I congratulate you, and\r\nMaryland, and the nation, and the world, upon this event. I regret that\r\nit did not occur two years sooner, which, I am sure, would have saved the\r\nnation more money than would have met all the private loss incident to\r\nthe measure; but it has come at last, and I sincerely hope its friends\r\nmay fully realize all their anticipations of good from it, and that its\r\nopponents may by its effects be agreeably and profitably disappointed.\r\n\r\nA word upon another subject. Something said by the Secretary of State in\r\nhis recent speech at Auburn, has been construed by some into a threat,\r\nthat if I shall be beaten at the election, I will, between then and\r\nthe end of my constitutional term, do what I may be able to ruin the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nOthers regard the fact that the Chicago Convention adjourned, not sine\r\ndie, but to meet again, if called to do so by a particular individual, as\r\nthe intimation of a purpose that if their nominee shall be elected he\r\nwill at once seize control of the Government. I hope the good people will\r\npermit themselves to suffer no uneasiness on either point. I am struggling\r\nto maintain the Government, not to overthrow it. I am struggling\r\nespecially to prevent others from overthrowing it. I therefore say, that\r\nif I live, I shall remain President until the 4th of next March, and that\r\nwhoever shall be constitutionally elected, in November, shall be duly\r\ninstalled as President on the 4th of March, and in the interval I shall do\r\nmy utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage shall\r\nstart with the best possible chance of saving the ship. This is due to\r\nthe people, both on principle and under the Constitution. Their will,\r\nconstitutionally expressed, is the ultimate law for all. If they should\r\ndeliberately resolve to have immediate peace, even at the loss of their\r\ncountry and their liberties, I know not the power or the right to resist\r\nthem. It is their own business, and they must do as they please with their\r\nown. I believe, however, they are still resolved to preserve their country\r\nand their liberties; and in this, in office or out of it, I am resolved to\r\nstand by them. I may add, that in this purpose to save the country and its\r\nliberties, no classes of people seem so nearly unanimous as the soldiers\r\nin the field and the sailors afloat. Do they not have the hardest of it?\r\nWho should quail while they do not? God bless the soldiers and seamen,\r\nwith all their brave commanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OF THANKSGIVING, OCTOBER 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nIt has pleased Almighty God to prolong our national life another year,\r\ndefending us with his guardian care against unfriendly designs from\r\nabroad, and vouchsafing to us in His mercy many and signal victories over\r\nthe enemy, who is of our own household. It has also pleased our Heavenly\r\nFather to favor as well our citizens in their homes as our soldiers in\r\ntheir camps, and our sailors on the rivers and seas, with unusual health.\r\nHe has largely augmented our free population by emancipation and by\r\nimmigration, while he has opened to us new: sources of wealth, and has\r\ncrowned the labor of our working-men in every department of industry with\r\nabundant rewards. Moreover, he has been pleased to animate and inspire our\r\nminds and hearts with fortitude, courage, and resolution sufficient\r\nfor the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our\r\nadherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity, and to afford\r\nto us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our\r\ndangers and afflictions.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby appoint and set apart the last Thursday in November next as a day\r\nwhich I desire to be observed by all my fellow-citizens, wherever they\r\nmay be then, as a day of thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God, the\r\nbeneficent Creator and Ruler of the Universe. And I do further recommend\r\nto my fellow-citizens aforesaid, that on that occasion they do reverently\r\nhumble themselves in the dust, and from thence offer up penitent and\r\nfervent prayers and supplications to the great Disposer of events for\r\na return of the inestimable blessings of peace, union, and harmony\r\nthroughout the, land which it has pleased him to assign as a\r\ndwelling-place for ourselves and for our posterity throughout all\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this twentieth day of October, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM To J. G. NICOLAY. WASHINGTON, D. C., October 21, 1864. 9.45 P.M.\r\n\r\nJ. G. NICOLAY, Saint Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nWhile Curtis is fighting Price, have you any idea where the force under\r\nRosecrans is, or what it is doing?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. CAMPBELL AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 22, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSRS WILLIAM B. CAMPBELL, THOMAS A. R. NELSON, JAMES T. P. CARTER, JOHN\r\nWILLIAMS, A. BLIZZARD, HENRY COOPER, BAILLIE PEYTON, JOHN LELLYET, EMERSON\r\nETHERIDGE, and JOHN D. PERRYMAN.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--On the 15th day of this month, as I remember, a printed paper\r\nmanuscript, with a few manuscript interlineations, called a protest, with\r\nyour names appended thereto, and accompanied by another printed paper,\r\npurporting to be a proclamation by Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of\r\nTennessee, and also a manuscript paper, purporting to be extracts from the\r\nCode of Tennessee, were laid before me.\r\n\r\nThe protest, proclamation, and extracts are respectively as follows:\r\n\r\n[The protest is here recited, and also the proclamation of Governor\r\nJohnson, dated September 30, to which it refers, together with a list of\r\nthe counties in East, Middle, and West Tennessee; also extracts from the\r\nCode of Tennessee in relation to electors of President and Vice-President,\r\nqualifications of voters for members of the General Assembly, places of\r\nholding elections, and officers of popular elections.]\r\n\r\nAt the time these papers were presented, as before stated, I had never\r\nseen either of them, nor heard of the subject to which they related,\r\nexcept in a general way one day previously.\r\n\r\nUp to the present moment, nothing whatever upon the subject has\r\npassed between Governor Johnson, or any one else, connected with the\r\nproclamation, and myself.\r\n\r\nSince receiving the papers, as stated, I have given the subject such brief\r\nconsideration as I have been able to do, in the midst of so many pressing\r\npublic duties.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is, that I can have nothing to do with the matter, either to\r\nsustain the plan as the convention and Governor Johnson have initiated it,\r\nor to revoke or modify it as you demand.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution and laws, the President is charged with no duty in\r\nthe presidential election in any State, nor do I in this case perceive any\r\nmilitary reason for his interference in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe movement set on foot by the convention and Governor Johnson does not,\r\nas seems to be assumed by you, emanate from the National Executive.\r\n\r\nIn no proper sense can it be considered other than an independent movement\r\nof, at least, a portion of the loyal people of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nI do not perceive in the plan any menace, or violence, or coercion towards\r\nany one.\r\n\r\nGovernor Johnson, like any other loyal citizen of Tennessee, has the right\r\nto favor any political plan he chooses, and, as military governor, it is\r\nhis duty to keep peace among and for the loyal people of the State.\r\n\r\nI cannot discern that by this plan he purposes any more. But you object to\r\nthe plan.\r\n\r\nLeaving it alone will be your perfect security against it. It is not\r\nproposed to force you into it. Do as you please, on your own account,\r\npeaceably and loyally, and Governor Johnson will not molest you, but will\r\nprotect you against violence as far as in his power.\r\n\r\nI presume that the conducting of a presidential election in Tennessee\r\nin strict accordance with the old Code of the State, is not now a\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add, that if any election shall be held\r\nand any votes shall be cast in the State of Tennessee for President and\r\nVice-President of the United States, it will belong, not to the military\r\nagents, nor yet to the Executive Department, but exclusively to another\r\ndepartment of the Government, to determine whether they are entitled to be\r\ncounted in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nExcept it be to give protection against violence, I decline to interfere\r\nin any way with any presidential election.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October\r\n22, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN:\r\n\r\nWith great pleasure I tender to you and your brave army the thanks of\r\nthe nation, and my own personal admiration and gratitude, for the month's\r\noperations in the Shenandoah Valley; and especially for the splendid work\r\nof October 19, 1864.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Auburn, New York:\r\n\r\nNews from Grant, Sherman, Thomas and Rosecrans satisfactory, but not\r\nimportant. Pirate Florida captured by the Wachusett October 7, on the\r\ncoast of Brazil. The information is certain.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE, NOVEMBER 9, 1864.\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--Even before I had been informed by you that\r\nthis compliment was paid me by loyal citizens of Pennsylvania, friendly\r\nto me, I had inferred that you were of that portion of my countrymen who\r\nthink that the best interests of the nation are to be subserved by the\r\nsupport of the present administration. I do not pretend to say that you,\r\nwho think so, embrace all the patriotism and loyalty of the country, but I\r\ndo believe, and I trust without personal interest, that the welfare of the\r\ncountry does require that such support and indorsement should be given.\r\n\r\nI earnestly believe that the consequences of this day's work, if it be as\r\nyou assume, and as now seems probable, will be to the lasting advantage,\r\nif not to the very salvation, of the country. I cannot at this hour say\r\nwhat has been the result of the election. But, whatever it may be, I have\r\nno desire to modify this opinion: that all who have labored to-day in\r\nbehalf of the Union have wrought for the best interests of the country and\r\nthe world; not only for the present, but for all future ages.\r\n\r\nI am thankful to God for this approval of the people; but, while deeply\r\ngrateful for this mark of their confidence in me, if I know my heart, my\r\ngratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph. I do not impugn the\r\nmotives of any one opposed to me. It is no pleasure to me to triumph\r\nover any one, but I give thanks to the Almighty for this evidence of\r\nthe people's resolution to stand by free government and the rights of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO H. W. HOFFMAN. WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C. November 10,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nH. HOFFMAN, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nThe Maryland soldiers in the Army of the Potomac cast a total vote of\r\nfourteen hundred and twenty-eight, out of which we get eleven hundred and\r\nsixty majority. This is directly from General Meade and General Grant.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE, NOVEMBER 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a grave question whether any government, not too strong\r\nfor the liberties of its people, can be strong enough to maintain its\r\nexistence in great emergencies. On this point the present rebellion\r\nbrought our government to a severe test, and a presidential election\r\noccurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not a little to\r\nthe strain.\r\n\r\nIf the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the\r\nrebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by\r\na political war among themselves? But the election was a necessity. We\r\ncannot have free government without elections; and if the election could\r\nforce us to forego or postpone a national election, it might fairly claim\r\nto have already conquered and ruined us. The strife of the election is\r\nbut human nature practically applied to the facts of the case. What has\r\noccurred in this case must ever recur in similar cases. Human nature will\r\nnot change. In any future great national trial, compared with the men of\r\nthis, we will have as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and\r\nas good. Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this as philosophy to\r\nlearn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged.\r\n\r\nBut the election, along with its incidental and undesirable strife, has\r\ndone good, too. It has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain\r\na national election in the midst of a great civil war. Until now, it has\r\nnot been known to the world that this was a possibility. It shows, also,\r\nhow sound and strong we still are. It shows that even among the candidates\r\nof the same party, he who is most devoted to the Union and most opposed\r\nto treason can receive most of the people's votes. It shows, also, to\r\nthe extent yet known, that we have more men now than we had when the war\r\nbegan. Gold is good in its place; but living, brave, and patriotic men are\r\nbetter than gold.\r\n\r\nBut the rebellion continues, and, now that the election is over, may\r\nnot all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our\r\ncommon country? For my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid\r\nplacing any obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I have not\r\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I am duly sensible to\r\nthe high compliment of a re-election, and duly grateful, as I trust, to\r\nAlmighty God, for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion, as\r\nI think, for their good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other\r\nman may be disappointed by the result.\r\n\r\nMay I ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this\r\nsame spirit towards those who have? And now, let me close by asking three\r\nhearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen, and their gallant and\r\nskillful commanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. O. BURBRIDGE. WASHINGTON, D.C., November 10, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURBRIDGE, Lexington, Ky.:\r\n\r\nI have just received a telegram from Governor Bramlette saying: \"General\r\nJohn B. Houston, a loyal man and prominent citizen, was arrested, and\r\nyesterday, started off by General Burbridge, to be sent beyond our lines\r\nby way of Catlettsburg, for no other offense than opposition to your\r\nre-election,\" and I have answered him as follows below, of which please\r\ntake notice and report to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., November 10, 1864. GOVERNOR BRAMLETTE, Frankfort, Ky.:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday received. I can scarcely believe that General John\r\nB. Houston has been arrested \"for no other offense than opposition to my\r\nre-election;\" for, if that had been deemed sufficient cause of arrest, I\r\nshould have heard of more than one arrest in Kentucky on election day.\r\nIf, however, General Houston has been arrested for no other cause than\r\nopposition to my re-election, General Burbridge will discharge him at\r\nonce, I sending him a copy of this as an order to that effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. A. HURLBUT.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 14, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HURLBUT:\r\n\r\nFew things since I have been here have impressed me more painfully\r\nthan what, for four or five months past, has appeared a bitter military\r\nopposition to the new State government of Louisiana. I still indulged some\r\nhope that I was mistaken in the fact; but copies of a correspondence\r\non the subject between General Canby and yourself, and shown me to-day,\r\ndispel that hope. A very fair proportion of the people of Louisiana\r\nhave inaugurated a new State government, making an excellent new\r\nconstitution--better for the poor black man than we have in Illinois. This\r\nwas done under military protection, directed by me, in the belief, still\r\nsincerely entertained, that with such a nucleus around which to build we\r\ncould get the State into position again sooner than otherwise. In this\r\nbelief a general promise of protection and support, applicable alike to\r\nLouisiana and other States, was given in the last annual message. During\r\nthe formation of the new government and constitution they were supported\r\nby nearly every loyal person, and opposed by every secessionist. And\r\nthis support and this opposition, from the respective standpoints of the\r\nparties, was perfectly consistent and logical. Every Unionist ought to\r\nwish the new government to succeed; and every disunionist must desire it\r\nto fail. Its failure would gladden the heart of Slidell in Europe, and\r\nof every enemy of the old flag in the world. Every advocate of slavery\r\nnaturally desires to see blasted and crushed the liberty promised the\r\nblack man by the new constitution. But why General Canby and General\r\nHurlbut should join on the same side is to me incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the condition of things at New Orleans, the military must\r\nnot be thwarted by the civil authority; but when the Constitutional\r\nConvention, for what it deems a breach of privilege, arrests an editor in\r\nno way connected with the military, the military necessity for insulting\r\nthe convention and forcibly discharging the editor is difficult to\r\nperceive. Neither is the military necessity for protecting the people\r\nagainst paying large salaries fixed by a legislature of their own choosing\r\nvery apparent. Equally difficult to perceive is the military necessity for\r\nforcibly interposing to prevent a bank from loaning its own money to the\r\nState. These things, if they have occurred, are, at the best, no better\r\nthan gratuitous hostility. I wish I could hope that they may be shown not\r\nto have occurred. To make assurance against misunderstanding, I repeat\r\nthat in the existing condition of things in Louisiana, the military\r\nmust not be thwarted by the civil authority; and I add that on points of\r\ndifference the commanding general must be judge and master. But I also add\r\nthat in the exercise of this judgment and control, a purpose, obvious, and\r\nscarcely unavowed, to transcend all military necessity, in order to crush\r\nout the civil government, will not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO MARYLAND UNION COMMITTEE, NOVEMBER 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe President, in reply, said that he had to confess he had been duly\r\nnotified of the intention to make this friendly call some days ago, and in\r\nthis he had had a fair opportunity afforded to be ready with a set speech;\r\nbut he had not prepared one, being too busy for that purpose. He would\r\nsay, however, that he was gratified with the result of the presidential\r\nelection. He had kept as near as he could to the exercise of his best\r\njudgment for the interest of the whole country, and to have the seal of\r\napprobation stamped on the course he had pursued was exceedingly grateful\r\nto his feelings. He thought he could say, in as large a sense as any other\r\nman, that his pleasure consisted in belief that the policy he had pursued\r\nwas the best, if not the only one, for the safety of the country.\r\n\r\nHe had said before, and now repeated, that he indulged in no feeling of\r\ntriumph over any man who thought or acted differently from himself. He\r\nhad no such feeling toward any living man. When he thought of Maryland, in\r\nparticular, he was of the opinion that she had more than double her share\r\nin what had occurred in the recent elections. The adoption of a free-State\r\nconstitution was a greater thing than the part taken by the people of the\r\nState in the presidential election. He would any day have stipulated to\r\nlose Maryland in the presidential election to save it by the adoption of\r\na free-State constitution, because the presidential election comes every\r\nfour years, while that is a thing which, being done, cannot be undone. He\r\ntherefore thought that in that they had a victory for the right worth a\r\ngreat deal more than their part in the presidential election, though\r\nof the latter he thought highly. He had once before said, but would say\r\nagain, that those who have differed with us and opposed us will see that\r\nthe result of the presidential election is better for their own good than\r\nif they had been successful.\r\n\r\nThanking the committee for their compliment, he brought his brief speech\r\nto a close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING BLOCKADE, NOVEMBER 19, 1864\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas by my proclamation of the 19th of April, 1861, it was declared\r\nthat the ports of certain States, including those of Norfolk, in the State\r\nof Virginia, Fernandina and Pensacola, in the State of Florida, were, for\r\nreasons therein set forth, intended to be placed under blockade; and:\r\n\r\nWhereas the said ports were subsequently blockaded accordingly, but having\r\nfor some time past been in the military possession of the United States,\r\nit is deeemd advisable that they should be opened to domestic and foreign\r\ncommerce:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section\r\nof the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled \"An\r\nact further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for\r\nother purposes,\" do hereby declare that the blockade of the said ports of\r\nNorfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola shall so far cease and determine, from\r\nand after the first day of December next, that commercial intercourse with\r\nthose ports, except as to persons, things, and information contraband of\r\nwar, may, from that time, be carried on, subject to the laws of the United\r\nStates, to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations which may\r\nbe prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and to such military\r\nand naval regulations as are now in force, or may hereafter be found\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this\r\nnineteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight\r\nhundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the\r\neighty-ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

BIXBY, Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM:--I have been shown in the files of the War Department a\r\nstatement of the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts that you are the mother\r\nof five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel\r\nhow weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to\r\nbeguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain\r\nfrom tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks\r\nof the Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may\r\nassuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished\r\nmemory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to\r\nhave laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely and respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 21, 1864.\r\n\r\nDEACON JOHN PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have heard of the incident at the polls in your town, in\r\nwhich you acted so honorable a part, and I take the liberty of writing\r\nto you to express my personal gratitude for the compliment paid me by the\r\nsuffrage of a citizen so venerable.\r\n\r\nThe example of such devotion to civic duties in one whose days have\r\nalready been extended an average lifetime beyond the Psalmist's limit,\r\ncannot but be valuable and fruitful. It is not for myself only, but for\r\nthe country which you have in your sphere served so long and so well, that\r\nI thank you.\r\n\r\nYour friend and servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR BRAMLETTE. WASHINGTON, D. C. NOVEMBER 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR BRAMLETTE, Frankfort, Ky.:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day received. It seems that Lieutenant-Governor Jacobs and\r\nColonel Wolford are stationary now. General Sudarth and Mr. Hodges are\r\nhere, and the Secretary of War and myself are trying to devise means of\r\npacification and harmony for Kentucky, which we hope to effect soon, now\r\nthat the passion-exciting subject of the election is past.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN, WASHINGTON, D.C., NOVEMBER 25, 1864\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania;\r\n\r\nI have no knowledge, information, or belief, that three States--or any\r\nStates, offer to resume allegiance.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON D.C., NOV.\r\n26, 1864\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS:\r\n\r\nPlease telegraph me briefly on what charge and evidence Mrs. Anna B.\r\nMartin has been sent to the penitentiary at Alton.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday of last week, two ladies from Tennessee came before the\r\nPresident, asking the release of their husbands held as prisoners of war\r\nat Johnson's Island. They were put off until Friday, when they came again,\r\nand were again put off until Saturday. At each of the interviews one of\r\nthe ladies urged that her husband was a religious man, and on Saturday the\r\nPresident ordered the release of the prisoners, when he said to this lady:\r\n\"You say your husband is a religious man; tell him when you meet him, that\r\nI say I am not much of a judge of religion, but that, in my opinion, the\r\nreligion that sets men to rebel and fight against their own government,\r\nbecause, as they think, that government does not sufficiently help some\r\nmen to eat their bread in the sweat of other men's faces, is not the sort\r\nof religion upon which people can get to heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE STEAMER \"FUNAYMA SOLACE.\"\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nA war steamer, called the Funayma Solace, having been built in this\r\ncountry, for the Japanese government and at the instance of that\r\ngovernment, it is deemed to comport with the public interest, in view of\r\nthe unsettled condition of the relations of the United States with that\r\nEmpire, that the steamer should not be allowed to proceed to Japan. If,\r\nhowever, the Secretary of the Navy should ascertain that the steamer is\r\nadapted to our service, he is authorized to purchase her, but the purchase\r\nmoney will be held in trust toward satisfying any valid claims which may\r\nbe presented by the Japanese on account of the construction of the steamer\r\nand the failure to deliver the same, as above set forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, December 5, 1864\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that\r\nCaptain John A. Winslow, United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks from\r\nCongress for the skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the brilliant\r\naction whilst in command of the United States steamer Keaysarge, which led\r\nto the total destruction of the piratical craft Alabama, on the 19th of\r\nJune, 1864., a vessel superior in tonnage, superior in number of guns, and\r\nsuperior in number of crew.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the\r\nrequirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the\r\nfollowing words, viz:\r\n\r\nThat any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one\r\ngrade, if, upon recommendation by the President by name he receives the\r\nthanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the\r\nenemy, or far extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, December 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Lieutenant William B. Gushing, United States Navy, receive a vote of\r\nthanks from Congress for his important, gallant, and perilous achievement\r\nin destroying the rebel ironclad steamer Albemarle on the night of the\r\n27th of October, 1864., at Plymouth, N. C.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of so formidable a vessel, which had resisted the\r\ncontinued attacks of a number of our vessels on former occasions, is an\r\nimportant event touching our future naval and military operations, and\r\nwould reflect honor on any officer, and redounds to the credit of this\r\nyoung officer and the few brave comrades who assisted in this successful\r\nand daring undertaking.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the\r\nrequirements of the ninth section of the Aforesaid act, which is in the\r\nfollowing words, namely:\r\n\r\nThat any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one\r\ngrade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the\r\nthanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the\r\nenemy, or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nAgain the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest\r\ngratitude to Almighty God.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory.\r\n\r\nMexico continues to be a theater of civil war. While our political\r\nrelations with that country have undergone no change, we have at the same\r\ntime strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a competent\r\nengineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan\r\nand the port of San Juan. It is a source of much satisfaction that the\r\ndifficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions and\r\ncaused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have been amicably\r\nadjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon\r\nbe reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation. We could not\r\nexaggerate either the commercial or the political importance of that great\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nIt would be doing injustice to an important South American State not\r\nto acknowledge the directness, frankness, and cordiality with which the\r\nUnited States of Colombia have entered into intimate relations with this\r\ngovernment. A claims convention has been constituted to complete the\r\nunfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861.\r\n\r\nThe new liberal constitution of Venezuela having gone into effect with\r\nthe universal acquiescence of the people, the government under it has been\r\nrecognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a cordial\r\nand friendly spirit. The long-deferred Aves Island claim has been\r\nsatisfactorily paid and discharged.\r\n\r\nMutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint\r\ncommission for the settlement of claims between the United States and\r\nPeru. An earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the two\r\ncountries, and such efforts as were in my power have been used to remove\r\nmisunderstanding, and avert a threatened war between Peru and Spain.\r\n\r\nOur relations are of the most friendly nature with Chile, the Argentine\r\nRepublic, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Salvador, and Haiti.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of\r\nthese republics, and on the other hand, their sympathies with the United\r\nStates are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness.\r\n\r\nThe claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macedonian in\r\n1821 has been paid in full by the Government of Chile.\r\n\r\nCivil war continues in the Spanish part of San Domingo, apparently without\r\nprospect of an early close.\r\n\r\nOfficial correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it gives\r\nus a pleasing view of social and political progress in that republic. It\r\nmay be expected to derive new vigor from American influence improved by\r\nthe rapid disappearance of slavery in the United States.\r\n\r\nI solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat, at moderate\r\ncost, to be reimbursed to the United States by instalments. Such a vessel\r\nis needed for the safety of that state against the native African races,\r\nand in Liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the African\r\nslave-trade than a squadron in our own hands. The possession of the least\r\norganized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the republic,\r\nand the confidence which we should manifest by furnishing it would win\r\nforbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, by the way of\r\nBering Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by Congress at the\r\nlast session, has been undertaken, under very favorable circumstances,\r\nby an association of American citizens, with the cordial good-will and\r\nsupport as well of this Government as of those of Great Britain and\r\nRussia. Assurances have been received from most of the South American\r\nStates of their high appreciation of the enterprise and their readiness\r\nto co-operate in constructing lines tributary to that world-encircling\r\ncommunication. I learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a\r\ntelegraphic communication between the eastern coast of America and\r\nGreat Britain has been renewed, with full expectation of its early\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nThus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will\r\nbe able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of\r\ncommerce and civilization.\r\n\r\nOur very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in April last.\r\nAn unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of\r\nthe office and the Government of the Pasha resulted in a suspension\r\nof intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the\r\nsuccessor in the consulate, and our relations with Egypt, as well as our\r\nrelations with the Barbary Powers, are entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China has at last been\r\nsuppressed, with the co-operating good offices of this Government and of\r\nthe other Western commercial States. The judicial consular establishment\r\nthere has become very difficult and onerous, and it will need legislative\r\nrevision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce and to the more\r\nintimate intercourse which has been instituted with the Government and\r\npeople of that vast Empire. China seems to be accepting with hearty\r\ngood-will the conventional laws which regulate commercial and social\r\nintercourse among the Western nations.\r\n\r\nOwing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of its\r\nGovernment, the action of that empire in performing treaty stipulations is\r\ninconstant and capricious. Nevertheless, good progress has been effected\r\nby the Western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary\r\nclaims have been allowed or put in course of settlement, and the inland\r\nsea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also to believe that\r\nthese proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of\r\nJapan toward the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened by\r\nproclamation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether\r\nit is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as just to\r\nthe United States, to resort to these and other open ports than it is to\r\npursue, through many hazards and at vast cost, a contraband trade with\r\nother ports which are closed, if not by actual military occupation, at\r\nleast by a lawful and effective blockade.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive, under\r\nthe law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in\r\nthe United States. If Congress should think that proceedings in such\r\ncases lack the authority of law, or ought to be further regulated by it, I\r\nrecommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign\r\nslave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal\r\noccupation in our country.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that if it were a new and open question the maritime\r\npowers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not concede the privileges\r\nof a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United States, destitute,\r\nas they are, and always have been, equally of ships of war and of ports\r\nand harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither assiduous nor more\r\nsuccessful during the last year than they were before that time in their\r\nefforts, under favor of that privilege, to embroil our country in foreign\r\nwars. The desire and determination of the governments of the maritime\r\nstates to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as and can\r\nnot be more earnest than our own. Nevertheless, unforeseen political\r\ndifficulties have arisen, especially in Brazilian and British ports and on\r\nthe northern boundary of the United States, which have required, and are\r\nlikely to continue to require, the practice of constant vigilance and a\r\njust and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States, as well as\r\nof the nations concerned and their governments.\r\n\r\nCommissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain\r\non the adjustment of the claims of the Hudson Bay and Puget Sound\r\nAgricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution\r\nof the trust assigned to them.\r\n\r\nIn view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent\r\nto the Canadian border, by reason of recent assaults and depredations\r\ncommitted by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it\r\nhas been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six\r\nmonths, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement\r\nwith Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty\r\nto increase their naval armament upon the Lakes if they shall find that\r\nproceeding necessary. The condition of the border will necessarily come\r\ninto consideration in connection with the question of continuing or\r\nmodifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States, as\r\nwell as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily established by\r\nthe reciprocity treaty of the 5th June, 1854.\r\n\r\nI desire, however, to be understood while making this statement that the\r\ncolonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust\r\nor unfriendly toward the United States, but, on the contrary, there is\r\nevery reason to expect that, with the approval of the Imperial Government,\r\nthey will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nThe act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration\r\nhas so far as was possible been put into operation. It seems to need\r\namendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent the\r\npractice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on\r\ntheir arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of\r\navocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition toward this\r\ngreat national policy is manifested by most of the European States, and\r\nought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective\r\nnational protection. I regard our immigrants as one of the principal\r\nreplenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the\r\nravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health.\r\nAll that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its present\r\nfullness, and to that end the Government must in every way make it\r\nmanifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military\r\nservice upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our\r\ncountry. The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully\r\nadministered during the last year. The legislation of the last session of\r\nCongress has beneficially affected the revenues, although sufficient\r\ntime has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the\r\nprovisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation.\r\n\r\nThe receipts during the year from all sources, upon the basis of warrants\r\nsigned by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and the balance\r\nin the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were $1,394,196,007.62, and\r\nthe aggregate disbursements, upon the same basis, were $1,298,056,101.89,\r\nleaving a balance in the Treasury, as shown by warrants, of\r\n$96,739,905.73.\r\n\r\nDeduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt\r\nredeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, and the\r\nactual cash operations of the Treasury were: receipts, $884,076,646.57;\r\ndisbursements, $865,234,087.86; which leaves a cash balance in the\r\nTreasury of $18,842,558.71.\r\n\r\nOf the receipts there were derived from customs $102,316,152.99, from\r\nlands $588,333.29, from direct taxes $475,648.96, from internal revenue\r\n$109,741,134.10, from miscellaneous sources $47,511,448.10, and from loans\r\napplied to actual expenditures, including former balance, $623,443,929.13.\r\n\r\nThere were disbursed for the civil service $27,505,599.46, for pensions\r\nand Indians $7,517,930.97, for the War Department $690,791,842.97, for\r\nthe Navy Department $85,733,292.77, for interest on the public debt\r\n$53,685,421.69, making an aggregate of $865,234,087.86, and leaving a\r\nbalance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71, as before stated.\r\n\r\nFor the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the\r\nestimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of\r\nthe current fiscal year, and the general operations of the Treasury in\r\ndetail, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. I\r\nconcur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to\r\nmeet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should\r\nbe still further increased; and I earnestly invite your attention to this\r\nsubject to the end that there be such additional legislation as shall be\r\nrequired to meet the just expectations of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on the first day of July last, as appears by the books\r\nof the Treasury, amounted to $1,740,690,489.49. Probably, should the war\r\ncontinue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from\r\n$500,000,000. Held, as it is, for the most part by our own people, it has\r\nbecome a substantial branch of national, though private, property. For\r\nobvious reasons the more nearly this property can be distributed among\r\nall the people the better. To favor such general distribution, greater\r\ninducements to become owners might, perhaps, with good effect and without\r\ninjury be presented to persons of limited means. With this view I suggest\r\nwhether it might not be both competent and expedient for Congress to\r\nprovide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities\r\nmight be held by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation and from\r\nseizure for debt, under such restrictions and limitations as might be\r\nnecessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege. This\r\nwould enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a\r\npossible day of want.\r\n\r\nPrivileges like these would render the possession of such securities to\r\nthe amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who might\r\nbe able to save enough for the purpose. The great advantage of citizens\r\nbeing creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is\r\nobvious. Men readily perceive that they can not be much oppressed by a\r\ndebt which they owe to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on the first day of July last, although somewhat exceeding\r\nthe estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress at the\r\ncommencement of the last session, falls short of the estimate of that\r\nofficer made in the preceding December as to its probable amount at the\r\nbeginning of this year by the sum of $3,995,097.31. This fact exhibits a\r\nsatisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists\r\nand to the people. On the twenty-fifth day of November five hundred and\r\neighty-four national banks had been organized, a considerable number of\r\nwhich were conversions from State banks. Changes from State systems to the\r\nnational system are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon\r\nthere will be in the United States no banks of issue not authorized by\r\nCongress and no bank-note circulation not secured by the Government. That\r\nthe Government and the people will derive great benefit from this change\r\nin the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned. The\r\nnational system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support\r\nof the national credit and protect the people against losses in the use of\r\npaper money. Whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the\r\nsuppression of State-bank issues, it will be for Congress to determine.\r\nIt seems quite clear that the Treasury can not be satisfactorily conducted\r\nunless the Government can exercise a restraining power over the bank-note\r\ncirculation of the country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will\r\ndetail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the\r\nlast annual message, and also the operations of the several administrative\r\nbureaus of the War Department during the last year. It will also specify\r\nthe measures deemed essential for the national defense and to keep up and\r\nsupply the requisite military force.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and\r\nsatisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the naval\r\nservice. It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our\r\ncountrymen that a Navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so\r\nbrief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success.\r\n\r\nThe general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under construction on\r\nthe first of December, 1864, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying 4610\r\nguns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during the year, over\r\nand above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83 vessels, 167 guns,\r\nand 42,427 tons.\r\n\r\nThe total number of men at this time in the naval service, including\r\nofficers, is about 51,000.\r\n\r\nThere have been captured by the Navy during the year 324 vessels, and the\r\nwhole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1379, of\r\nwhich 267 are steamers.\r\n\r\nThe gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property thus\r\nfar reported amount to $14,369,250.51. A large amount of such proceeds is\r\nstill under adjudication and yet to be reported.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditure of the Navy Department of every description,\r\nincluding the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into\r\nexistence from the fourth of March, 1861, to the first of November, 1864,\r\nis $238,647,262.35.\r\n\r\nYour favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations\r\nof the Secretary of the Navy, especially in regard to a navy-yard and\r\nsuitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels and\r\nthe machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference was made in\r\nmy last annual message.\r\n\r\nYour attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in\r\nrelation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respect to\r\nprize on our inland waters.\r\n\r\nI cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the\r\npropriety of creating the new rank of vice-admiral in our naval service.\r\n\r\nYour attention is invited to the report of the Postmaster-General for\r\na detailed account of the operations and financial condition of the\r\nPost-Office Department.\r\n\r\nThe postal revenues for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to\r\n$12,438,253.78, and the expenditures to $12,644,786.20, the excess of\r\nexpenditures over receipts being $206,532.42.\r\n\r\nThe views presented by the Postmaster-General on the subject of special\r\ngrants by the Government in aid of the establishment of new lines of\r\nocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development of\r\nincreased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries\r\nshould receive the careful consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population,\r\nimprovement, and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied\r\nportions of our country have scarcely been checked, much less impeded or\r\ndestroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seem to\r\nhave absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been completed\r\nin conformity with law, and thus our excellent system is firmly\r\nestablished in the mountains, which once seemed a barren and uninhabitable\r\nwaste between the Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the\r\ncoast of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity\r\nand rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance and\r\nthe interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities,\r\nhave been only partially organized; but it is understood that these\r\ndifficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their governments,\r\nlike those of the others, to go into speedy and full operation.\r\n\r\nAs intimately connected with and promotive of this material growth of the\r\nnation, I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable information and\r\nimportant recommendations relating to the public lands, Indian affairs,\r\nthe Pacific Railroad, and mineral discoveries contained in the report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior which is herewith transmitted, and which\r\nreport also embraces the subjects of patents, pensions, and other topics\r\nof public interest pertaining to his Department.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending\r\non the thirtieth of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614\r\nacres were entered under the homestead law. The remainder was located\r\nwith military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States for\r\nrailroads, and sold for cash. The cash received from sales and location\r\nfees was $1,019,446.\r\n\r\nThe income from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, was\r\n$678,007.21, against $136,077.95 received during the preceding year. The\r\naggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the\r\nquantity disposed of, and there is open to settlement about 133,000,000\r\nacres of surveyed land.\r\n\r\nThe great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific States by\r\nrailways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives\r\nassurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the\r\nprevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of the main line\r\nof the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles westward\r\nfrom the initial point at Omaha City, Nebraska, and a preliminary location\r\nof the Pacific Railroad of California has been made from Sacramento\r\neastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada.\r\n\r\nNumerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cinnabar mines have been added\r\nto the many heretofore known, and the country occupied by the Sierra\r\nNevada and Rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with\r\nenterprising labor, which is richly remunerative. It is believed that the\r\nproduce of the mines of precious metals in that region has during the year\r\nreached, if not exceeded, $100,000,000 in value.\r\n\r\nIt was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be\r\nremodeled. Congress at its last session, acting upon the recommendation,\r\ndid provide for reorganizing the system in California, and it is believed\r\nthat under the present organization the management of the Indians there\r\nwill be attended with reasonable success. Much yet remains to be done to\r\nprovide for the proper government of the Indians in other parts of the\r\ncountry, to render it secure for the advancing settler, and to provide for\r\nthe welfare of the Indian. The Secretary reiterates his recommendations,\r\nand to them the attention of Congress is invited.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid\r\nsoldiers and sailors of the Republic and to the widows, orphans, and\r\ndependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease\r\ncontracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have been\r\ndiligently administered. There have been added to the pension rolls during\r\nthe year ending the 30th day of June last the names of 16,770 invalid\r\nsoldiers and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number of army\r\ninvalid pensioners 22,767 and of navy invalid pensioners 712.\r\n\r\nOf widows, orphans, and mothers 22,198 have been placed on the army\r\npension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number of army\r\npensioners of this class is 25,433 and of navy pensioners 793. At the\r\nbeginning of the year the number of Revolutionary pensioners was 1430.\r\nOnly twelve of them were soldiers, of whom seven have since died.\r\nThe remainder are those who under the law receive pensions because\r\nof relationship to Revolutionary soldiers. During the year ending the\r\nthirtieth of June, 1864, $4,504,616.92 have been paid to pensioners of all\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nI cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent\r\ninstitutions of the District of Columbia which have hitherto been\r\nestablished or fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer for\r\ninformation concerning them and in relation to the Washington Aqueduct,\r\nthe Capitol, and other matters of local interest to the report of the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Department, under the supervision of its present\r\nenergetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending itself to the great and\r\nvital interest it was created to advance. It is peculiarly the people's\r\ndepartment, in which they feel more directly concerned than in any other.\r\nI commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe war continues. Since the last annual message all the important lines\r\nand positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained and our\r\narms have steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions left in rear, so\r\nthat Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other States have again\r\nproduced reasonably fair crops.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is\r\nGeneral Sherman's attempted march of three hundred miles directly through\r\nthe insurgent region. It tends to show a great increase of our relative\r\nstrength that our General-in-Chief should feel able to confront and\r\nhold in check every active force of the enemy, and yet to detach a\r\nwell-appointed large army to move on such an expedition. The result not\r\nyet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged.\r\n\r\nImportant movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of\r\nmolding society for durability in the Union. Although short of complete\r\nsuccess, it is much in the right direction that twelve thousand citizens\r\nin each of the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State\r\ngovernments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to\r\nmaintain and administer them. The movements in the same direction more\r\nextensive though less definite in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee,\r\nshould not be overlooked. But Maryland presents the example of complete\r\nsuccess. Maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future. The\r\ngenius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul spirit\r\nbeing driven out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo her no more.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of the Constitution\r\nabolishing slavery throughout the United States passed the Senate,\r\nbut failed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Although the present is the same Congress and nearly the\r\nsame members, and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those\r\nwho stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the reconsideration and\r\npassage of the measure at the present session. Of course the abstract\r\nquestion is not changed; but an intervening election shows almost\r\ncertainly that the next Congress will pass the measure if this does not.\r\nHence there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment\r\nwill go to the States for their action. And as it is to so go at all\r\nevents, may we not agree that the sooner the better? It is not claimed\r\nthat the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or\r\ntheir votes any further than, as an additional element to be considered,\r\ntheir judgment may be affected by it. It is the voice of the people now\r\nfor the first time heard upon the question. In a great national crisis\r\nlike ours, unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very\r\ndesirable, almost indispensable. And yet no approach to such unanimity is\r\nattainable unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority\r\nsimply because it is the will of the majority. In this case the common end\r\nis the maintenance of the Union, and among the means to secure that end\r\nsuch will, through the election, is most clearly declared in favor of such\r\nConstitutional amendment.\r\n\r\nThe most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is derived\r\nthrough our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass and its\r\nresult, the purpose of the people within the loyal States to maintain the\r\nintegrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than\r\nnow. The extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions\r\nof voters met and mingled at the polls give strong assurance of this.\r\nNot only all those who supported the Union ticket, so called, but a great\r\nmajority of the opposing party also may be fairly claimed to entertain and\r\nto be actuated by the same purpose. It is an unanswerable argument to\r\nthis effect that no candidate for any office whatever, high or low, has\r\nventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the Union.\r\nThere have been much impugning of motives and much heated controversy as\r\nto the proper means and best mode of advancing the Union cause, but on\r\nthe distinct issue of Union or no Union the politicians have shown their\r\ninstinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people. In\r\naffording the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to\r\nthe world this firmness and unanimity of purpose, the election has been of\r\nvast value to the national cause.\r\n\r\nThe election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be known--the\r\nfact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of\r\nnational resources, that of living men. While it is melancholy to reflect\r\nthat the war has filled so many graves and carried mourning to so many\r\nhearts, it is some relief to know that, compared with the surviving,\r\nthe fallen have been so few. While corps and divisions and brigades and\r\nregiments have formed and fought and dwindled and gone out of existence, a\r\ngreat majority of the men who composed them are still living. The same is\r\ntrue of the naval service. The election returns prove this. So many voters\r\ncould not else be found. The States regularly holding elections, both now\r\nand four years ago, to wit, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,\r\nMinnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon,\r\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, cast\r\n3,982,011 votes now, against 3,870,222 cast then, showing an aggregate now\r\nof 3,982,011. To this is to be added 33,762 cast now in the new States of\r\nKansas and Nevada, which States did not vote in 1860, thus swelling the\r\naggregate to 4,015,773 and the net increase during the three years and a\r\nhalf of war to 145,551. A table is appended showing particulars. To\r\nthis again should be added the number of all soldiers in the field from\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, and\r\nCalifornia, who by the laws of those States could not vote away from their\r\nhomes, and which number can not be less than 90,000. Nor yet is this all.\r\nThe number in organized Territories is triple now what it was four years\r\nago--while thousands, white and black, join us as the national arms press\r\nback the insurgent lines. So much is shown, affirmatively and negatively,\r\nby the election. It is not material to inquire how the increase has been\r\nproduced or to show that it would have been greater but for the war, which\r\nis probably true. The important fact remains demonstrated that we have\r\nmore men now than we had when the war began; that we are not exhausted nor\r\nin process of exhaustion; that we are gaining strength and may if need be\r\nmaintain the contest indefinitely. [This sentence recognizes the concern\r\nof a guerilla war after the main war finished.]This as to men. Material\r\nresources are now more complete and abundant than ever.\r\n\r\nThe national resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as we believe,\r\ninexhaustible. The public purpose to re-establish and maintain the\r\nnational authority is unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable.\r\nThe manner of continuing the effort remains to choose. On careful\r\nconsideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no\r\nattempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good.\r\nHe would accept nothing short of severance of the Union, precisely what\r\nwe will not and can not give. His declarations to this effect are explicit\r\nand oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. He affords us no\r\nexcuse to deceive ourselves. He can not voluntarily reaccept the Union;\r\nwe can not voluntarily yield it. Between him and us the issue is distinct,\r\nsimple, and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war and\r\ndecided by victory. If we yield, we are beaten; if the Southern people\r\nfail him, he is beaten. Either way it would be the victory and defeat\r\nfollowing war. What is true, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause\r\nis not necessarily true of those who follow. Although he can not reaccept\r\nthe Union, they can. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and\r\nreunion. The number of such may increase. They can at any moment have\r\npeace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national\r\nauthority under the Constitution. After so much the Government could not,\r\nif it would, maintain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain\r\nor allow it. If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the\r\npeaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operating\r\nonly in Constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain, and other\r\npossible, questions are and would be beyond the Executive power to adjust;\r\nas, for instance, the admission of members into Congress and whatever\r\nmight require the appropriation of money. The Executive power itself\r\nwould be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war. Pardons\r\nand remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be within Executive\r\ncontrol. In what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be\r\nfairly judged of by the past.\r\n\r\nA year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were offered\r\nto all except certain designated classes, and it was at the same time made\r\nknown that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of\r\nspecial clemency. During the year many availed themselves of the general\r\nprovision, and many more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some\r\nled to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less\r\neasy and certain. During the same time also special pardons have\r\nbeen granted to individuals of the excepted classes, and no voluntary\r\napplication has been denied. Thus practically the door has been for a full\r\nyear open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice;\r\nthat is, such as were in custody or under constraint. It is still so open\r\nto all. But the time may come, probably will come, when public duty shall\r\ndemand that it be closed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than\r\nheretofore shall be adopted.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national\r\nauthority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable\r\ncondition to ending the war on the part of the Government, I retract\r\nnothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat the declaration made a\r\nyear ago, that \"while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt\r\nto retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to\r\nslavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any\r\nof the acts of Congress.\" If the people should, by whatever mode or means,\r\nmake it an Executive duty to re-enslave such persons, another, and not I,\r\nmust be their instrument to perform it.\r\n\r\nIn stating a single condition of peace I mean simply to say that the war\r\nwill cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall have ceased on\r\nthe part of those who began it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE, DECEMBER 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--I believe I shall never be old enough to\r\nspeak without embarrassment when I have nothing to talk about. I have no\r\ngood news to tell you, and yet I have no bad news to tell. We have talked\r\nof elections until there is nothing more to say about them. The most\r\ninteresting news now we have is from Sherman. We all know where he went\r\nin at, but I can't tell where he will come out at. I will now close by\r\nproposing three cheers for General Sherman and his army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR HALL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 7, 1864.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR HALL, Jefferson City, Mo.:\r\n\r\nComplaint is made to me of the doings of a man at Hannibal, Mo., by the\r\nname of Haywood, who, as I am told, has charge of some militia force, and\r\nis not in the United States service. Please inquire into the matter and\r\ncorrect anything you may find amiss if in your power.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Smith and the Hon. Henry\r\nStanbery be, and they are hereby, appointed special commissioners to\r\ninvestigate and report, for the information of the President; upon the\r\ncivil and military administration in the military division bordering upon\r\nand west of the Mississippi, under such instructions as shall be issued by\r\nauthority of the President and the War Department.\r\n\r\nSecond, said commissioners shall have power to examine witnesses\r\nupon oath, and to take such proofs orally or in writing, upon the\r\nsubject-matters of investigation as they may deem expedient, and return\r\nthe same together with their report.\r\n\r\nThird, all officers and persons in the military, naval and revenue\r\nservices, or in any branch of the public service under the authority\r\nof the United States Government, are required, upon subpoena issued by\r\ndirection of the said commissioners, to appear before them at such time\r\nand place as may be designated in said subpoena and to give testimony on\r\noath touching such matters as may be inquired of by the commissioners,\r\nand to produce such books, papers, writings, and documents as they may\r\nbe notified or required to produce by the commissioners, and as may be in\r\ntheir possession.\r\n\r\nFourth, said special commissioners shall also investigate and report upon\r\nany other matters that may hereafter be directed by the Secretary of War,\r\nand shall with all convenient dispatch make report to him in writing of\r\ntheir investigation, and shall also from time to time make special reports\r\nto the Secretary of War upon such matters as they may deem of importance\r\nto the public interests.\r\n\r\nFifth, the Secretary of War shall assign to the said commissioners such\r\naid and assistance as may be required for the performance of their duties,\r\nand make such just and reasonable allowances and compensation for the said\r\ncommissioners and for the persons employed by them as he may deem proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

WASHINGTON, D.C., December 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS, Nashville, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nPlease accept for yourself, officers, and men, the nation's thanks for\r\nyour good work of yesterday. You made a magnificent beginning; a grand\r\nconsummation is within your easy reach. Do not let it slip.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE \"GREENBACK\" CURRENCY\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL B. D. TAYLOR\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December [16?], 1864.\r\n\r\nDEAR COLONEL DICK:--I have long determined to make public the origin of\r\nthe greenback and tell the world that it is Dick Taylor's creation. You\r\nhad always been friendly to me, and when troublous times fell on us, and\r\nmy shoulders, though broad and willing, were weak, and myself surrounded\r\nby such circumstances and such people that I knew not whom to trust, then\r\nI said in my extremity: \"I will send for Colonel Taylor; he will know what\r\nto do.\" I think it was in January, 1862, on or about the 16th, that I did\r\nso. You came, and I said to you:\r\n\r\n\"What can we do?\" Said you, \"Why, issue Treasury notes bearing no\r\ninterest, printed on the best banking paper. Issue enough to pay off the\r\nArmy expenses and declare it legal tender.\"\r\n\r\nChase thought it a hazardous thing, but we finally accomplished it,\r\nand gave the people of this Republic the greatest blessing they ever\r\nhad--their own paper to pay their own debts.\r\n\r\nIt is due to you, the father of the present greenback, that the people\r\nshould know it, and I take great pleasure in making it known. How many\r\ntimes have I laughed at you telling me plainly that I was too lazy to be\r\nanything but a lawyer.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA.

SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 26, 1864\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL SHERMAN:--Many, many thanks for your Christmas gift, the\r\ncapture of Savannah.\r\n\r\nWhen you were about leaving Atlanta for the Atlantic coast, I was\r\nanxious, if not fearful; but feeling that you were the better judge, and\r\nremembering that \"nothing risked, nothing gained,\" I did not interfere.\r\nNow, the undertaking being a success, the honor is all yours; for I\r\nbelieve none of us went further than to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nAnd taking the work of General Thomas into the count, as it should be\r\ntaken, it is indeed a great success. Not only does it afford the obvious\r\nand immediate military advantages; but in showing to the world that your\r\narmy could be divided, putting the stronger part to an important new\r\nservice, and yet leaving enough to vanquish the old opposing force of the\r\nwhole,--Hood's army,--it brings those who sat in darkness to see a great\r\nlight. But what next?\r\n\r\nI suppose it will be safe if I leave General Grant and yourself to decide.\r\n\r\nPlease make my grateful acknowledgments to your whole army of officers and\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO OFFICER IN COMMAND AT LEXINGTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nOFFICER IN COMMAND at Lexington, Ky.:\r\n\r\nIf within your power send me the particulars of the causes for which\r\nLieutenant-Governor Jacob was arrested and sent away.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Among the most gratifying proofs\r\nof this conviction is the hearty devotion everywhere exhibited by our\r\nschools and colleges to the national cause.\r\n\r\nI am most thankful if my labors have seemed to conduct to the preservation\r\nof those institutions, under which alone we can expect good government and\r\nin its train sound learning, and the progress of the liberal arts.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very truly, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 5, 1865.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nI herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, a \"joint\r\nresolution to correct certain clerical errors in the internal revenue\r\nact,\" without my approval.\r\n\r\nMy reason for so doing is that I am informed that this joint resolution\r\nwas prepared during the last moments of the last session of Congress for\r\nthe purpose of correcting certain errors of reference in the internal\r\nrevenue act, which were discovered on an examination of an official\r\ncopy procured from the State Department a few hours only before the\r\nadjournment. It passed the House and went to the Senate, where a vote was\r\ntaken upon it, but by some accident it was not presented to the President\r\nof the Senate for his signature.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of the last session of Congress, other errors of a\r\nkind similar to those which this resolution was designed to correct,\r\nhave been discovered in the law, and it is now thought most expedient to\r\ninclude all the necessary corrections in one act or resolution.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the proper committee of the House has, I am informed,\r\nbeen already directed to the preparation of a bill for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nRichard T.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I transmit to Congress a\r\ncopy of two treaties between the United States and Belgium, for the\r\nextinguishment of the Scheldt dues, etc., concluded on the twentieth of\r\nMay, 1863, and twentieth of July, 1863, respectively, the ratifications of\r\nwhich were exchanged at Brussels on the twenty-fourth of June last; and\r\nI recommend an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions thereof\r\nrelative to the payment of the proportion of the United States toward the\r\ncapitalization of the said dues.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

My son, now in his twenty-second year, having graduated at\r\nHarvard, wishes to see something of the war before it ends. I do not wish\r\nto put him in the ranks, nor yet to give him a commission, to which those\r\nwho have already served long are better entitled and better qualified to\r\nhold. Could he, without embarrassment to you, or detriment to the service,\r\ngo into your military family with some nominal rank, I, and not the\r\npublic, furnishing his necessary means? If no, say so without the least\r\nhesitation, because I am as anxious and as deeply interested that you\r\nshall not be encumbered as you can be yourself.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nSeveral members of the Cabinet, with myself, considered the question,\r\nto-day, as to the time of your coming on here. While we fully appreciate\r\nyour wish to remain in Tennessee until her State government shall be\r\ncompletely reinaugurated, it is our unanimous conclusion that it is unsafe\r\nfor you to not be here on the 4th of March. Be sure to reach here by that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

You will, of course, expect that I\r\nacknowledge it. So much has been said about Gettysburg and so well, that\r\nfor me to attempt to say more may perhaps only serve to weaken the force\r\nof that which has already been said. A most graceful and eloquent tribute\r\nwas paid to the patriotism and self-denying labors of the American\r\nladies, on the occasion of the consecration of the National Cemetery at\r\nGettysburg, by our illustrious friend, Edward Everett, now, alas! departed\r\nfrom earth. His life was a truly great one, and I think the greatest part\r\nof it was that which crowned its closing years, I wish you to read, if you\r\nhave not already done so, the eloquent and truthful words which he then\r\nspoke of the women of America. Truly, the services they have rendered to\r\nthe defenders of our country in this perilous time, and are yet rendering,\r\ncan never be estimated as they ought to be. For your kind wishes to me\r\npersonally, I beg leave to render you likewise my sincerest thanks. I\r\nassure you they are reciprocated. And now, gentlemen and ladies, may God\r\nbless you all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 25, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point\r\n\r\nIf Newell W.

Note on the\r\ncopy which you retain the time of delivery and to whom delivered. Receive\r\ntheir answer in writing, waiting a reasonable time for it, and which, if\r\nit contain their decision to come through without further condition, will\r\nbe your warrant to ask General Ord to pass them through as directed in the\r\nletter of the Secretary of War to him.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS TO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 31, 1865.\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State\r\n\r\nYou will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, there to meet and\r\ninformally confer with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, on the\r\nbasis of my letter to F. P. Blair, Esq., of January 18, 1865, a copy\r\nof which you have. You will make known to them that three things are\r\nindispensable to wit:\r\n\r\n1. The restoration of the national authority throughout all the States.\r\n\r\n2. No receding by the Executive of the United States on the slavery\r\nquestion from the position assumed thereon in the late annual message to\r\nCongress, and in preceding documents.\r\n\r\n3. No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war and the\r\ndisbanding of all forces hostile to the Government.\r\n\r\nYou will inform them that all propositions of theirs, not inconsistent\r\nwith the above, will be considered and passed upon in a spirit of sincere\r\nliberality. You will hear all they may choose to say and report it to me.\r\nYou will not assume to definitely consummate anything.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR THE ABOLISHING OF SLAVERY\r\n\r\nPASSAGE THROUGH CONGRESS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR THE\r\nABOLISHING OF SLAVERY\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE, JANUARY 31, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe supposed the passage through Congress of the Constitutional amendment\r\nfor the abolishing of slavery throughout the United States was the\r\noccasion to which he was indebted for the honor of this call.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was one of congratulation to the country, and to the whole\r\nworld. But there is a task yet before us--to go forward and consummate by\r\nthe votes of the States that which Congress so nobly began yesterday. He\r\nhad the honor to inform those present that Illinois had already done the\r\nwork. Maryland was about half through, but he felt proud that Illinois was\r\na little ahead.\r\n\r\nHe thought this measure was a very fitting if not an indispensable adjunct\r\nto the winding up of the great difficulty. He wished the reunion of\r\nall the States perfected, and so effected as to remove all causes of\r\ndisturbance in the future; and, to attain this end, it was necessary\r\nthat the original disturbing cause should, if possible, be rooted out. He\r\nthought all would bear him witness that he had never shirked from doing\r\nall that he could to eradicate slavery, by issuing an Emancipation\r\nProclamation. But that proclamation falls short of what the amendment\r\nwill be when fully consummated. A question might be raised whether the\r\nproclamation was legally valid. It might be added, that it only aided\r\nthose who came into our lines, and that it was inoperative as to those\r\nwho did not give themselves up; or that it would have no effect upon the\r\nchildren of the slaves born hereafter; in fact, it would be urged that it\r\ndid not meet the evil. But this amendment is a king's cure for all evils.\r\nIt winds the whole thing up. He would repeat, that it was the fitting if\r\nnot the indispensable adjunct to the consummation of the great game we are\r\nplaying. He could not but congratulate all present--himself, the country,\r\nand the whole world upon this great moral victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, February 1, 1865\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point:\r\n\r\nLet nothing which is transpiring change, hinder, or delay your military\r\nmovements or plans.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER TO MAKE CORRECTIONS IN THE DRAFT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY, February 6, 1865\r\n\r\nWhereas complaints are made in some localities respecting the assignments\r\nof quotas and credits allowed for the pending call of troops to fill\r\nup the armies: Now, in order to determine all controversies in respect\r\nthereto, and to avoid any delay in filling up the armies, it is ordered,\r\n\r\n1. That the Attorney-General, Brigadier-General Richard Delafield, and\r\nColonel C. W. Foster, be, and they are hereby constituted, a board to\r\nexamine into the proper quotas and credits of the respective States and\r\ndistricts under the call of December 19, 1864, with directions, if any\r\nerrors be found therein, to make such corrections as the law and facts may\r\nrequire, and report their determination to the Provost-Marshal-General.\r\nThe determination of said board to be final and conclusive, and the draft\r\nto be made in conformity therewith.\r\n\r\n2. The Provost-Marshal-General is ordered to make the draft in the\r\nrespective districts as speedily as the same can be done after the\r\nfifteenth of this month.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nPROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL:\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen distinctly say to me this morning that what they want is\r\nthe means from your office of showing their people that the quota assigned\r\nto them is right. They think it will take but little time--two hours, they\r\nsay. Please give there double the time and every facility you can.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe Provost-Marshal brings this letter back to me and says he cannot give\r\nthe facility required without detriment to the service, and thereupon he\r\nis excused from doing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL GLENN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 7, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-COLONEL GLENN, Commanding Post at Henderson, Ky.:\r\n\r\nComplaint is made to me that you are forcing negroes into the military\r\nservice, and even torturing them--riding them on rails and the like to\r\nextort their consent. I hope this may be a mistake. The like must not be\r\ndone by you, or any one under you. You must not force negroes any more\r\nthan white men. Answer me on this.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SMITH.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR SMITH, of Vermont:\r\n\r\nComplaint is made to me, by Vermont, that the assignment of her quota for\r\nthe draft on the pending call is intrinsically unjust, and also in\r\nbad faith of the Government's promise to fairly allow credits for men\r\npreviously furnished. To illustrate, a supposed case is stated as follows:\r\n\r\nVermont and New Hampshire must between them furnish six thousand men on\r\nthe pending call; and being equal, each must furnish as many as the other\r\nin the long run. But the Government finds that on former calls Vermont\r\nfurnished a surplus of five hundred, and New Hampshire a surplus, of\r\nfifteen hundred. These two surpluses making two thousand and added to the\r\nsix thousand, making eight thousand to be furnished by the two States, or\r\nfour thousand each less, by fair credits. Then subtract Vermont's surplus\r\nof five hundred from her four thousand, leaves three thousand five hundred\r\nas her quota on the pending call; and likewise subtract New Hampshire's\r\nsurplus of fifteen hundred from her four thousand, leaves two thousand\r\nfive hundred as her quota on the pending call. These three thousand five\r\nhundred and two thousand five hundred make precisely six thousand, which\r\nthe supposed case requires from the two States, and it is just equal for\r\nVermont to furnish one thousand more now than New Hampshire, because New\r\nHampshire has heretofore furnished one thousand more than Vermont, which\r\nequalizes the burdens of the two in the long run. And this result, so far\r\nfrom being bad faith to Vermont, is indispensable to keeping good faith\r\nwith New Hampshire. By no other result can the six thousand men be\r\nobtained from the two States, and, at the same time deal justly and\r\nkeep faith with both, and we do but confuse ourselves in questioning the\r\nprocess by which the right result is reached. The supposed case is perfect\r\nas an illustration.\r\n\r\nThe pending call is not for three hundred thousand men subject to fair\r\ncredits, but is for three hundred thousand remaining after all fair\r\ncredits have been deducted, and it is impossible to concede what Vermont\r\nasks without coming out short of three hundred thousand men, or making\r\nother localities pay for the partiality shown her.\r\n\r\nThis upon the case stated. If there be different reasons for making an\r\nallowance to Vermont, let them be presented and considered.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution entitled \"Joint resolution declaring certain States\r\nnot entitled to representation in the electoral college\" has been signed\r\nby the Executive in deference to the view of Congress implied in its\r\npassage and presentation to him. In his own view, however, the two Houses\r\nof Congress, convened under the twelfth article of the Constitution, have\r\ncomplete power to exclude from counting all electoral votes deemed by\r\nthem to be illegal, and it is not competent for the Executive to defeat or\r\nobstruct that power by a veto, as would be the case if his action were at\r\nall essential in the matter. He disclaims all right of the Executive to\r\ninterfere in any way in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral\r\nvotes, and he also disclaims that by signing said resolution he has\r\nexpressed any opinion on the recitals of the preamble or any judgment of\r\nhis own upon the subject of the resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February\r\n8, 1865\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point. Va.:\r\n\r\nI am called on by the House of Representatives to give an account of my\r\ninterview with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, and it is very\r\ndesirable to me to put your despatch of February 1, to the Secretary of\r\nWar, in which, among other things, you say: \"I fear now their going\r\nback without any expression from any one in authority will have a bad\r\ninfluence.\" I think the despatch does you credit, while I do not see that\r\nit can embarrass you. May I use it?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULT OF THE ELECTORAL COUNT\r\n\r\nREPLY TO A COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS, REPORTING THE RESULT OF THE ELECTORAL\r\nCOUNT,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nWith deep gratitude to my countrymen for this mark of their confidence;\r\nwith a distrust of my own ability to perform the duty required under\r\nthe most favorable circumstances, and now rendered doubly difficult by\r\nexisting national perils; yet with a firm reliance on the strength of\r\nour free government, and the eventual loyalty of the people to the just\r\nprinciples upon which it is founded, and above all with an unshaken\r\nfaith in the Supreme Ruler of nations, I accept this trust. Be pleased to\r\nsignify this to the respective Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGIC REVIEW OF PEACE PROPOSALS\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 10, 1865\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn response to your resolution of the eighth instant, requesting\r\ninformation in relation to a conference recently held in Hampton Roads,\r\nI have the honor to state that on the day of the date I gave Francis P.\r\nBlair, Sr., a card, written on as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nDecember 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nAllow the bearer, F. P. Blair, Sr., to pass our lines, go South, and\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat at the time I was informed that Mr. Blair sought the card as a means\r\nof getting to Richmond, Va., but he was given no authority to speak or act\r\nfor the Government, nor was I informed of anything he would say or do on\r\nhis own account or otherwise. Afterwards Mr. Blair told me that he had\r\nbeen to Richmond and had seen Mr. Jefferson Davis; and he (Mr. B.) at the\r\nsame time left with me a manuscript letter, as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, VA., January 12, 1865. F. P. BLAIR, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have deemed it proper, and probably desirable to you, to give you\r\nin this for in the substance of remarks made by me, to be repeated by you\r\nto President Lincoln, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nI have no disposition to find obstacles in forms, and am willing, now as\r\nheretofore, to enter into negotiations for the restoration of peace, and\r\nam ready to send a commission whenever I have reason to suppose it will be\r\nreceived, or to receive a commission if the United States Government\r\nshall choose to send one. That notwithstanding the rejection of our former\r\noffers, I would, if you could promise that a commissioner, minister, or\r\nother agent would be received, appoint one immediately, and renew the\r\neffort to enter into conference with a view to secure peace to the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nYours, etc., JEFFERSON DAVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards, and with the view that it should be shown to Mr. Davis, I\r\nwrote and delivered to Mr. Blair a letter, as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 18, 1865.\r\n\r\nP. P. BLAIR, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Your having shown me Mr. Davis's letter to you of the twelfth\r\ninstant, you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and\r\nshall continue ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential\r\nperson now resisting the national authority may informally send to me with\r\nthe view of securing peace to the people of our one common country.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards Mr. Blair dictated for and authorized me to make an entry on\r\nthe back of my retained copy of the letter last above recited, which entry\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\nJanuary 28, 1865\r\n\r\nTo-day Mr. Blair tells me that on the twenty-first instant he delivered\r\nto Mr. Davis the original of which the within is a copy, and left it with\r\nhim; that at the time of delivering it Mr. Davis read it over twice in Mr.\r\nBlair's presence, at the close of which he (Mr. Blair) remarked that the\r\npart about \"our one common country\" related to the part of Mr. Davis'\r\nletter about \"the two countries,\" to which Mr. Davis replied that he so\r\nunderstood it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards the Secretary of War placed in my hands the following telegram,\r\nindorsed by him, as appears:\r\n\r\nOFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH WAR DEPARTMENT. The following\r\ntelegram received at Washington January 29, 1865, from headquarters Army\r\nof James,\r\n\r\n6.30 P.M., January 29, 1865:\r\n\r\n\"HON. EDWIN M.

(Sent at 2\r\nA.M., 30th.) MAJOR-GENERAL ORD.\r\n\r\nSIR:--This Department has no knowledge of any understanding by General\r\nGrant to allow any person to come within his lines as commissioner of any\r\nsort.

STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards, by my direction, the Secretary of War telegraphed General Ord\r\nas follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., January 30. 10.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL E.

STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards I prepared and put into the hands of Major Thomas T. Eckert the\r\nfollowing instructions and message:\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nMAJOR T. T.

WASHINGTON, January 30, 1865\r\n\r\nSIR:--You will proceed with the documents placed in your hands, and on\r\nreaching General Ord will deliver him the letter addressed to him by the\r\nSecretary of War; then, by General Ord's assistance, procure an interview\r\nwith Messrs.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA.. February 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS, J. A. CAMPBELL AND R. M. T.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards, but before Major Eckert had departed, the following dispatch\r\nwas received from General Grant:\r\n\r\nOFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH, WAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe following telegram received at Washington January 30, 1865, from City\r\nPoint, Va., 10.30 A.M., January 30, 1865:\r\n\r\n  \"His EXCELLENCY\r\n  A.

U.S. GRANT,\r\nLieutenant-General, Commanding Armies United States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, it will be perceived, transferred General Ord's agency in the matter\r\nto General Grant. I resolved, however, to send Major Eckert forward with\r\nhis message, and accordingly telegraphed General Grant as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, January 13, 1865 (Sent at 1.30 P.M.)\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nA messenger is coming to you on the business contained in your despatch.\r\nDetain the gentlemen in comfortable quarters until he arrives, and then\r\nact upon the message he brings as far as applicable, it having been\r\nmade up to pass through General Ord's hands, and when the gentlemen were\r\nsupposed to be beyond our lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State:\r\n\r\nYou will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Va., there to meet and informally\r\nconfer with Messrs.

I notified them that they could not proceed further unless\r\nthey complied with the terms expressed in my letter. The point of meeting\r\ndesignated in the above note would not, in my opinion, be insisted\r\nupon. Think Fort Monroe would be acceptable. Having complied with my\r\ninstructions, I will return to Washington to-morrow unless otherwise\r\nordered.\r\n\r\nTHOS. T.

EDWIN M.

Stephens and Hunter that their\r\nintentions are good and their desire sincere to restore peace and union.\r\nI have not felt myself at liberty to express even views of my own or to\r\naccount for my reticency. This has placed me in an awkward position, which\r\nI could have avoided by not seeing them in the first instance. I fear now\r\ntheir going back without any expression from anyone in authority will have\r\na bad influence. At the same time, I recognize the difficulties in the way\r\nof receiving these informal commissioners at this time, and do not know\r\nwhat to recommend. I am sorry, however, that Mr. Lincoln can not have an\r\ninterview with the two named in this despatch, if not all three now within\r\nour lines. Their letter to me was all that the President's instructions\r\ncontemplated to secure their safe conduct if they had used the same\r\nlanguage to Major Eckert.\r\n\r\n\"U.S. GRANT \"Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis despatch of General Grant changed my purpose, and accordingly I\r\ntelegraphed him and the Secretary of State, respectively, as follows:\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

Stanton, Secretary of War, Washington.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 2nd I reached Hampton Roads, found the Secretary of\r\nState and Major Eckert on a steamer anchored offshore, and learned of\r\nthem that the Richmond gentlemen were on another steamer also anchored\r\noffshore, in the Roads, and that the Secretary of State had not yet seen\r\nor communicated with them. I ascertained that Major Eckert had literally\r\ncomplied with his instructions, and I saw for the first time the answer of\r\nthe Richmond gentlemen to him, which in his despatch to me of the 1st he\r\ncharacterizes as \"not satisfactory.\" That answer is as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., February 1, 1865. THOMAS T. ECKERT, Major and\r\nAid-de-Camp. MAJOR:-Your note, delivered by yourself this day, has been\r\nconsidered. In reply we have to say that we were furnished with a copy of\r\nthe letter of President Lincoln to Francis P.

MAJOR:--In reply to your verbal statement that your\r\ninstructions did not allow you to alter the conditions upon which a\r\npassport could be given to us, we say that we are willing to proceed to\r\nFortress Monroe and there to have an informal conference with any person\r\nor persons that President Lincoln may appoint on the basis of his letter\r\nto Francis P. Blair of the 18th of January ultimo, or upon any other terms\r\nor conditions that he may hereafter propose not inconsistent with the\r\nessential principles of self-government and popular rights, upon which our\r\ninstitutions are founded.\r\n\r\nIt is our earnest wish to ascertain, after a free interchange of ideas and\r\ninformation, upon what principles and terms, if any, a just and honorable\r\npeace can be established without the further effusion of blood, and to\r\ncontribute our utmost efforts to accomplish such a result.\r\n\r\nWe think it better to add that in accepting your passport we are not to\r\nbe understood as committing ourselves to anything but to carry to this\r\ninformal conference the views and feelings above expressed.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, yours, etc.,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER H. STEPHENS, J. A. CAMPBELL, R. M. T. HUNTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote.-The above communication was delivered to me at Fort Monroe at 4.30\r\nP.M. February 2 by Lieutenant-Colonel Babcock, of General Grant's staff.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS T. ECKERT Major and Aid-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the third the three gentlemen, Messrs. Stephens, Hunter,\r\nand Campbell, came aboard of our steamer and had an interview with the\r\nSecretary of State and myself of several hours' duration. No question\r\nof preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or mentioned; no\r\nother person was present; no papers were exchanged or produced; and it\r\nwas in advance agreed that the conversation was to be informal and\r\nverbal merely. On our part the whole substance of the instructions to the\r\nSecretary of State hereinbefore recited was stated and insisted upon, and\r\nnothing was said inconsistent therewith; while by the other party it was\r\nnot said that in any event or on any condition they ever would consent\r\nto reunion, and yet they equally omitted to declare that they never would\r\nconsent. They seemed to desire a postponement of that question and the\r\nadoption of some other course first, which, as some of them seemed to\r\nargue, might or might not lead to reunion, but which course we thought\r\nwould amount to an indefinite postponement. The conference ended without\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing, containing, as is believed, all the information sought is\r\nrespectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE. WASHINGTON, February 10, 1865\r\n\r\nTo THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the eighth instant,\r\nrequesting information concerning recent conversations or communications\r\nwith insurgents, under executive sanction, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, to whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State, to whom was referred a resolution of the Senate\r\nof the 8th instant, requesting \"the President of the United States, if, in\r\nhis opinion, not incompatible with the public interests, to furnish to the\r\nSenate any information in his possession concerning recent conversations\r\nor communications with certain rebels, said to have taken place under\r\nexecutive sanction, including communications with the rebel Jefferson\r\nDavis, and any correspondence relating thereto,\" has the honor to report\r\nthat the Senate may properly be referred to a special message of the\r\nPresident bearing upon the subject of the resolution, and transmitted to\r\nthe House this day. Appended to this report is a copy of an instruction\r\nwhich has been addressed to Charles Francis Adams, Esq., envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States at London,\r\nand which is the only correspondence found in this department touching the\r\nsubject referred to in the resolution.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, February 10, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SEWARD TO MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n(Extract.) No. 1258.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, February 7,1865\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 3d, the President, attended by the Secretary,\r\nreceived Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell on board the United\r\nStates steam transport River Queen in Hampton Roads. The conference was\r\naltogether informal. There was no attendance of secretaries, clerks, or\r\nother witnesses. Nothing was written or read. The conversation, although\r\nearnest and free, was calm, and courteous, and kind on both sides. The\r\nRichmond party approached the discussion rather indirectly, and at no time\r\ndid they either make categorical demands, or tender formal stipulations or\r\nabsolute refusals. Nevertheless, during the conference, which lasted\r\nfour hours, the several points at issue between the Government and the\r\ninsurgents were distinctly raised, and discussed fully, intelligently, and\r\nin an amicable spirit. What the insurgent party seemed chiefly to favor\r\nwas a postponement of the question of separation, upon which the war is\r\nwaged, and a mutual direction of efforts of the Government, as well as\r\nthose of the insurgents, to some extrinsic policy or scheme for a season\r\nduring which passions might be expected to subside, and the armies be\r\nreduced, and trade and intercourse between the people of both sections\r\nresumed. It was suggested by them that through such postponement we\r\nmight now have immediate peace, with some not very certain prospect of\r\nan ultimate satisfactory adjustment of political relations between this\r\nGovernment and the States, section, or people now engaged in conflict with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion, though deliberately considered, was nevertheless regarded\r\nby the President as one of armistice or truce, and he announced that we\r\ncan agree to no cessation or suspension of hostilities, except on the\r\nbasis of the disbandment of the insurgent forces, and the restoration\r\nof the national authority throughout all the States in the Union.\r\nCollaterally, and in subordination to the proposition which was thus\r\nannounced, the antislavery policy of the United States was reviewed in all\r\nits bearings, and the President announced that he must not be expected to\r\ndepart from the positions he had heretofore assumed in his proclamation\r\nof emancipation and other documents, as these positions were reiterated in\r\nhis last annual message. It was further declared by the President that\r\nthe complete restoration of the national authority was an indispensable\r\ncondition of any assent on our part to whatever form of peace might be\r\nproposed. The President assured the other party that, while he must adhere\r\nto these positions, he would be prepared, so far as power is lodged with\r\nthe Executive, to exercise liberality. His power, however, is limited by\r\nthe Constitution; and when peace should be made, Congress must necessarily\r\nact in regard to appropriations of money and to the admission of\r\nrepresentatives from the insurrectionary States. The Richmond party\r\nwere then informed that Congress had, on the 31st ultimo, adopted by\r\na constitutional majority a joint resolution submitting to the several\r\nStates the proposition to abolish slavery throughout the Union, and that\r\nthere is every reason to expect that it will be soon accepted by three\r\nfourths of the States, so as to become a part of the national organic law.\r\n\r\nThe conference came to an end by mutual acquiescence, without producing\r\nan agreement of views upon the several matters discussed, or any of them.\r\nNevertheless, it is perhaps of some importance that we have been able to\r\nsubmit our opinions and views directly to prominent insurgents, and to\r\nhear them in answer in a courteous and not unfriendly manner.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ADMIRAL DAVID D. PORTER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 10, 1865\r\n\r\nREAR-ADMIRAL DAVID D. PORTER, Commanding North Atlantic Squadron, Hampton\r\nRoads, Va.\r\n\r\nSIR:--It is made my agreeable duty to enclose herewith the joint\r\nresolution approved 24th January, 1865, tendering the thanks of Congress\r\nto yourself, the officers and men under your command for their gallantry\r\nand good conduct in the capture of Fort Fisher, and through you to all who\r\nparticipated in that brilliant and decisive victory under your command.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 12, 1865\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nI understand that provost-marshals in different parts of Missouri are\r\nassuming to decide that the conditions of bonds are forfeited, and\r\ntherefore are seizing and selling property to pay damages. This, if true,\r\nis both outrageous and ridiculous. Do not allow it. The courts, and\r\nnot provost-marshals, are to decide such questions unless when military\r\nnecessity makes an exception. Also excuse John Eaton, of Clay County, and\r\nWesley Martin, of Platte, from being sent South, and let them go East if\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDING OFFICERS IN WEST TENNESSEE\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 13, 1865.\r\n\r\nTO THE MILITARY OFFICERS COMMANDING IN WEST TENNESSEE:\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot order as within requested, allow me to say that it is my\r\nwish for you to relieve the people from all burdens, harassments, and\r\noppressions, so far as is possible consistently with your military\r\nnecessities; that the object of the war being to restore and maintain\r\nthe blessings of peace and good government, I desire you to help, and not\r\nhinder, every advance in that direction.\r\n\r\nOf your military necessities you must judge and execute, but please do so\r\nin the spirit and with the purpose above indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 14, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday about provost-marshal system received. As part of\r\nthe same subject, let me say I am now pressed in regard to a pending\r\nassessment in St. Louis County. Please examine and satisfy yourself\r\nwhether this assessment should proceed or be abandoned; and if you\r\ndecide that it is to proceed, please examine as to the propriety of its\r\napplication to a gentleman by the name of Charles McLaran.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON February 15, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nPlease ascertain whether General Fisk's administration is as good as it\r\nmight be, and answer me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONVENING THE SENATE IN EXTRA SESSION,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nWhereas objects of interest to the United States require that the Senate\r\nshould be convened at twelve o'clock on the fourth of March next to\r\nreceive and act upon such communications as may be made to it on the part\r\nof the Executive;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, have\r\nconsidered it to be my duty to issue this, my proclamation, declaring\r\nthat an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States\r\nto convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol, in the city of\r\nWashington, on the fourth day of March next, at twelve o'clock at noon\r\non that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as\r\nmembers of that body are hereby required to take notice.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at\r\nWashington...............\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. By the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO OFFICER IN COMMAND AT HARPER'S FERRY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 17, 1865\r\n\r\nOFFICER IN COMMAND AT HARPER'S FERRY:\r\n\r\nChaplain Fitzgibbon yesterday sent me a despatch invoking Clemency for\r\nJackson, Stewart, and Randall, who are to be shot to-day. The despatch is\r\nso vague that there is no means here of ascertaining whether or not the\r\nexecution of sentence of one or more of them may not already have been\r\nordered. If not suspend execution of sentence m their cases until further\r\norders and forward records of trials for examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nMAJOR ECKERT: Please send above telegram JNO. G. NICOLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., February 24, 1865\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Virginia:\r\n\r\nI am in a little perplexity. I was induced to authorize a gentleman to\r\nbring Roger A. Pryor here with a view of effecting an exchange of him;\r\nbut since then I have seen a despatch of yours showing that you specially\r\nobject to his exchange. Meantime he has reached here and reported to\r\nme. It is an ungracious thing for me to send him back to prison, and yet\r\ninadmissible for him to remain here long. Cannot you help me out with it?\r\nI can conceive that there may be difference to you in days, and I can keep\r\nhim a few days to accommodate on that point. I have not heard of my son's\r\nreaching you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 24, 1865\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nPlease inquire and report to me whether there is any propriety of longer\r\nkeeping in Gratiott Street Prison a man said to be there by the name of\r\nRiley Whiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, February 25, 1865\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Virginia:\r\n\r\nGeneral Sheridan's despatch to you, of to-day, in which he says he \"will\r\nbe off on Monday,\" and that he \"will leave behind about two thousand men,\"\r\ncauses the Secretary of War and myself considerable anxiety. Have you\r\nwell considered whether you do not again leave open the Shenandoah Valley\r\nentrance to Maryland and Pennsylvania, or, at least, to the Baltimore and\r\nOhio Railroad?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D. C., February 27, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Virginia:\r\n\r\nSubsequent reflection, conference with General Halleck, your despatch, and\r\none from General Sheridan, have relieved my anxiety; and so I beg that you\r\nwill dismiss any concern you may have on my account, in the matter of my\r\nlast despatch.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. W. CONWAY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., March 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS W. CONWAY, General Superintendent Freedmen, Department of the\r\nGulf.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Your statement to Major-General Hurlbut of the condition of the\r\nfreedmen of your department, and of your success in the work of their\r\nmoral and physical elevation, has reached me and given me much pleasure.\r\n\r\nThat we shall be entirely successful in our efforts I firmly believe.\r\n\r\nThe blessing of God and the efforts of good and faithful men will bring us\r\nan earlier and happier consummation than the most sanguine friends of the\r\nfreedmen could reasonably expect.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D. C., March 2, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:\r\n\r\nYou have not sent contents of Richmond papers for Tuesday or Wednesday.\r\nDid you not receive them? If not, does it indicate anything?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 3, 1865. 12 PM.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to say to you that he wishes you to have no\r\nconference with General Lee unless it be for the capitulation of General\r\nLee's army, or on some minor and purely military matter. He instructs me\r\nto say that you are not to decide, discuss, or confer upon any political\r\nquestion. Such questions the President holds in his own hands, and will\r\nsubmit them to no military conferences or conventions. Meantime you are to\r\npress to the utmost your military advantages.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS, MARCH 4, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-COUNTRYMEN:--At this second appearing to take the oath of the\r\npresidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than\r\nthere was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course\r\nto be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four\r\nyears, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth\r\non every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the\r\nattention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new\r\ncould be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly\r\ndepends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust,\r\nreasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the\r\nfuture, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were\r\nanxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought\r\nto avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this\r\nplace, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent\r\nagents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to\r\ndissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties\r\ndeprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation\r\nsurvive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the\r\nwar came.\r\n\r\nOne eighth of the whole population was colored slaves, not distributed\r\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These\r\nslaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this\r\ninterest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and\r\nextend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend\r\nthe Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more\r\nthan to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected\r\nfor the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained.\r\nNeither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or\r\neven before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier\r\ntriumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the\r\nsame Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the\r\nother. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's\r\nassistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces,\r\nbut let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not\r\nbe answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His\r\nown purposes. \"Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs\r\nbe that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\" If\r\nwe shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which,\r\nin the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued\r\nthrough His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to\r\nboth North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom\r\nthe offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine\r\nattributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him?\r\nFondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war\r\nmay speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the\r\nwealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited\r\ntoil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash\r\nshall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand\r\nyears ago, so still it must be said, \"The judgments of the Lord are true\r\nand righteous altogether.\"\r\n\r\nWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right\r\nas God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we\r\nare in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have\r\nborne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may\r\nachieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL JOHN POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 7, 1865\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nPlease state briefly, by telegraph, what you concluded about the\r\nassessments in St. Louis County. Early in the war one Samuel B. Churchill\r\nwas sent from St. Louis to Louisville, where I have quite satisfactory\r\nevidence that he has not misbehaved. Still I am told his property at St.\r\nLouis is subjected to the assessment, which I think it ought not to be.\r\nStill I wish to know what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. WASHINGTON, D. C., March 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va:\r\n\r\nYour two despatches to the Secretary of War, one relating to supplies for\r\nthe enemy going by the Blackwater, and the other to General Singleton and\r\nJudge Hughes, have been laid before me by him. As to Singleton and Hughes,\r\nI think they are not in Richmond by any authority, unless it be from you.\r\nI remember nothing from me which could aid them in getting there, except a\r\nletter to you, as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY, February 7, 1865. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL\r\nGRANT, City Point, Va.: General Singleton, who bears you this, claims that\r\nhe already has arrangements made, if you consent, to bring a large amount\r\nof Southern produce through your lines. For its bearing on our finances,\r\nI would be glad for this to be done, if it can be, without injuriously\r\ndisturbing your military operations, or supplying the enemy. I wish you\r\nto be judge and master on these points. Please see and hear him fully,\r\nand decide whether anything, and, if anything, what, can be done in the\r\npremises. Yours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nI believe I gave Hughes a card putting him with Singleton on the same\r\nletter. However this may be, I now authorize you to get Singleton and\r\nHughes away from Richmond, if you choose, and can. I also authorize you,\r\nby an order, or in what form you choose, to suspend all operations on the\r\nTreasury trade permits, in all places southeastward of the Alleghenies.\r\nIf you make such order, notify me of it, giving a copy, so that I can give\r\ncorresponding direction to the Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION OFFERING PARDON TO DESERTERS,\r\n\r\nMARCH 11, 1865\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nWhereas, the twenty-first section of the act of Congress, approved on the\r\n3d instant, entitled \"An Act to amend the several acts heretofore passed\r\nto provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces and for\r\nother purposes,\" requires that in addition to the other lawful penalties\r\nof the crime of desertion from the military or naval service, all persons\r\nwho have deserted the military or naval service of the United States who\r\nshall not return to said service or report themselves to a provost-marshal\r\nwithin sixty days after the proclamation hereinafter mentioned, shall\r\nbe deemed and taken to have voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their\r\ncitizenship and their right to become citizens, and such deserters shall\r\nbe forever incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under the\r\nUnited States, or of exercising any rights of citizens thereof; and all\r\npersons who shall hereafter desert the military or naval service, and all\r\npersons who, being duly enrolled, shall depart the jurisdiction of the\r\ndistrict in which they are enrolled, or go beyond the limits of the United\r\nStates with intent to avoid any draft into the military or naval service\r\nduly ordered, shall be liable to the penalties of this section; and the\r\nPresident is hereby authorized and required forthwith, on the passage of\r\nthis act, to issue his proclamation setting forth the provisions of this\r\nsection, in which proclamation the President is requested to notify all\r\ndeserters returning within sixty days as aforesaid that they shall be\r\npardoned on condition of returning to their regiments and companies, or to\r\nsuch other organizations as they may be assigned to, until they shall have\r\nserved for a period of time equal to their original term of enlistment:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, do issue this my proclamation as required by said act,\r\nordering and requiring all deserters to return to their proper posts; and\r\nI do hereby notify them that all deserters who shall within sixty days\r\nfrom the date of this proclamation, viz., on or before the 10th day of\r\nMay, 1865, return to service or report themselves to a provost-marshal,\r\nshall be pardoned on condition that they return to their regiments or\r\ncompanies or to such other organization as they may be assigned to, and\r\nserve the remainder of their original terms of enlistment, and in addition\r\nthereto a period equal to the time lost by desertion.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed...............\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO H. T. BLOW.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 13, 1865.\r\n\r\nHON. HENRY T. BLOW, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nA Miss E. Snodgrass, who was banished from Saint Louis in May,1863, wishes\r\nto take the oath and return home. What say you?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THURLOW WEED,\r\n\r\nMARCH 15, 1865.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nDEAR Mr. WEED:\r\n\r\nEvery one likes a compliment. Thank you for yours on my little\r\nnotification speech and on the recent inaugural address. I expect the\r\nlatter to wear as well as perhaps better than--anything I have produced;\r\nbut I believe it is not immediately popular. Men are not flattered by\r\nbeing shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the\r\nAlmighty and them. To deny it, however, in this case, is to deny that\r\nthere is a God governing the world. It is a truth which I thought needed\r\nto be told, and, as whatever of humiliation there is in it falls most\r\ndirectly on myself, I thought others might afford for me to tell it.\r\n\r\nTruly yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO COLONEL ROUGH AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., March 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nCOL. R. M. ROUGH AND OTHERS, Chicago, Ill.:\r\n\r\nYours received. The best I can do with it is, to refer it to the\r\nWar Department. The Rock Island case referred to, was my individual\r\nenterprise; and it caused so much difficulty in so many ways that I\r\npromised to never undertake another.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO AN INDIANA REGIMENT,\r\n\r\nMARCH 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--It will be but a very few words that I shall undertake\r\nto say. I was born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana, and lived in Illinois;\r\nand now I am here, where it is my business to care equally for the good\r\npeople of all the States. I am glad to see an Indiana regiment on this\r\nday able to present the captured flag to the Governor of Indiana. I am not\r\ndisposed, in saying this, to make a distinction between the States, for\r\nall have done equally well.\r\n\r\nThere are but few views or aspects of this great war upon which I have\r\nnot said or written something whereby my own opinions might be known.\r\nBut there is one--the recent attempt of our erring brethren, as they are\r\nsometimes called, to employ the negro to fight for them. I have neither\r\nwritten nor made a speech on that subject, because that was their\r\nbusiness, not mine, and if I had a wish on the subject, I had not the\r\npower to introduce it, or make it effective. The great question with them\r\nwas whether the negro, being put into the army, will fight for them. I do\r\nnot know, and therefore cannot decide. They ought to know better than me.\r\nI have in my lifetime heard many arguments why the negroes ought to be\r\nslaves; but if they fight for those who would keep them in slavery, it\r\nwill be a better argument than any I have yet heard. He who will fight for\r\nthat, ought to be a slave. They have concluded, at last, to take one out\r\nof four of the slaves and put them in the army, and that one out of the\r\nfour who will fight to keep the others in slavery, ought to be a slave\r\nhimself, unless he is killed in a fight. While I have often said that all\r\nmen ought to be free, yet would I allow those colored persons to be slaves\r\nwho want to be, and next to them those white people who argue in favor of\r\nmaking other people slaves. I am in favor of giving an appointment to such\r\nwhite men to try it on for these slaves. I will say one thing in regard\r\nto the negroes being employed to fight for them. I do know he cannot fight\r\nand stay at home and make bread too. And as one is about as important as\r\nthe other to them, I don't care which they do. I am rather in favor of\r\nhaving them try them as soldiers. They lack one vote of doing that, and I\r\nwish I could send my vote over the river so that I might cast it in favor\r\nof allowing the negro to fight. But they cannot fight and work both. We\r\nmust now see the bottom of the enemy's resources. They will stand out as\r\nlong as they can, and if the negro will fight for them they must allow him\r\nto fight. They have drawn upon their last branch of resources, and we can\r\nnow see the bottom. I am glad to see the end so near at hand. I have said\r\nnow more than I intended, and will therefore bid you good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING INDIANS,\r\n\r\nMARCH 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas reliable information has been received that hostile Indians,\r\nwithin the limits of the United States, have been furnished with arms and\r\nmunitions of war by persons dwelling in conterminous foreign territory,\r\nand are thereby enabled to prosecute their savage warfare upon the exposed\r\nand sparse settlements of the frontier;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States of America, do hereby proclaim and direct that all persons\r\ndetected in that nefarious traffic shall be arrested and tried by\r\ncourt-martial at the nearest military post, and if convicted, shall\r\nreceive the punishment due to their deserts.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed...................\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER ANNULLING THE SENTENCE\r\n\r\nAGAINST BENJAMIN G. SMITH AND FRANKLIN W. SMITH,\r\n\r\nMARCH 18, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am unwilling for the sentence to stand, and be executed, to any extent\r\nin this case. In the absence of a more adequate motive than the evidence\r\ndiscloses, I am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal\r\nor fraudulent intent on the part of men of such well established good\r\ncharacter. If the evidence went as far to establish a guilty profit of one\r\nor two hundred thousand dollars, as it does of one or two hundred dollars,\r\nthe case would, on the question of guilt, bear a far different aspect.\r\nThat on this contract, involving some twelve hundred thousand dollars, the\r\ncontractors would plan, and attempt to execute a fraud which, at the most,\r\ncould profit them only one or two hundred, or even one thousand dollars,\r\nis to my mind beyond the power of rational belief. That they did not, in\r\nsuch a case, make far greater gains, proves that they did not, with\r\nguilty or fraudulent intent, make at all. The judgment and sentence are\r\ndisapproved, and declared null, and the defendants are fully discharged.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN March 18, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. POPE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 19, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL POPE, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that the plan of action for Missouri contained in your\r\nletter to the Governor of that State, and your other letter to me, is\r\nconcurred in by the Governor, it is approved by me, and you will be\r\nsustained in proceeding upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ORD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May [March] 20, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ORD, Army of the James\r\n\r\nIs it true that George W. Lane is detained at Norfolk without any charge\r\nagainst him? And if so why is it done?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO JUDGE SCATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 21, 1865.\r\n\r\nHON. WALTER B. SCATES, Centralia, Illinois:\r\n\r\nIf you choose to go to New Mexico and reside, I will appoint you chief\r\njustice there. What say you? Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. HANCOCK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., March 22, 1865. MAJOR-GENERAL HANCOCK, Winchester, Va.:\r\n\r\nSeeing your despatch about General Crook, and fearing that through\r\nmisapprehension something unpleasant may occur, I send you below two\r\ndespatches of General Grant, which I suppose will fully explain General\r\nCrook's movements.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER FEMALE SPY\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL DODGE. EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 23, 1865.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DODGE, Commanding, &c, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nAllow Mrs. R. S. Ewell the benefit of my amnesty proclamation on her\r\ntaking the oath.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 25, 1865. 8.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D. C.:\r\n\r\nArrived here all safe about 9 P.M. yesterday. No war news. General Grant\r\ndoes not seem to know very much about Yeatman, but thinks very well of him\r\nso far as he does know.\r\n\r\nI like Mr. Whiting very much, and hence would wish him to remain or resign\r\nas best suits himself. Hearing this much from me, do as you think best in\r\nthe matter. General Lee has sent the Russell letter back, concluding, as\r\nI understand from Grant, that their dignity does not admit of their\r\nreceiving the document from us. Robert just now tells me there was a\r\nlittle rumpus up the line this morning, ending about where it began.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\n(Cipher.)\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 25, 1865. (Received 5 P.M.)\r\n\r\nHON. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nI am here within five miles of the scene of this morning's action. I have\r\nnothing to add to what General Meade reports except that I have seen\r\nthe prisoners myself and they look like there might be the number he\r\nstates--1600.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., March 26, 1865. (Received 11.30 A.M.)\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nI approve your Fort Sumter programme. Grant don't seem to know Yeatman\r\nvery well, but thinks very well of him so far as he knows. Thinks it\r\nprobable that Y. is here now, for the place. I told you this yesterday\r\nas well as that you should do as you think best about Mr. Whiting's\r\nresignation, but I suppose you did not receive the dispatch. I am on the\r\nboat and have no later war news than went to you last night.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 27, 1865.3.35 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D.C.:\r\n\r\nYours inclosing Fort Sumter order received. I think of but one suggestion.\r\nI feel quite confident that Sumter fell on the 13th, and not on the 14th\r\nof April, as you have it. It fell on Saturday, the 13th; the first call\r\nfor troops on our part was got up on Sunday, the 14th, and given date and\r\nissued on Monday, the 15th. Look up the old almanac and other data, and\r\nsee if I am not right.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 28, 1865. 12 M.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D.C.: After your explanation, I think\r\nit is little or no difference whether the Fort Sumter ceremony takes place\r\non the 13th or 14th.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman tells me he is well acquainted with James Yeatman, and\r\nthat he thinks him almost the best man in the country for anything he will\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., March 30, 1865. 7.30 P.M. (Received 8.30 P.M.)\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nI begin to feel that I ought to be at home and yet I dislike to leave\r\nwithout seeing nearer to the end of General Grant's present movement.\r\nHe has now been out since yesterday morning and although he has not been\r\ndiverted from his programme no considerable effort has yet been produced\r\nso far as we know here. Last night at 10.15 P. M. when it was dark as a\r\nrainy night without a moon could be, a furious cannonade soon joined in by\r\na heavy musketry fire opened near Petersburg and lasted about two hours.\r\nThe sound was very distinct here as also were the flashes of the guns\r\nup the clouds. It seemed to me a great battle, but the older hands here\r\nscarcely noticed it and sure enough this morning it was found that very\r\nlittle had been done.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 31, 1865. 3 P.M.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY STANTON:\r\n\r\nAt 12.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphed me as follows: \"There has\r\nbeen much hard fighting this morning. The enemy drove our left from near\r\nDabney's house back well toward the Boydton plank road. We are now about\r\nto take the offensive at that point, and I hope will more than recover the\r\nlost ground.\"\r\n\r\nLater he telegraphed again as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Our troops, after being driven back to the Boydton plank road, turned and\r\ndrove the enemy in turn, and took the White Oak road, which we now have.\r\nThis gives us the ground occupied by the enemy this morning. I will send\r\nyou a rebel flag captured by our troops in driving the enemy back. There\r\nhave been four flags captured to-day.\"\r\n\r\nJudging by the two points from which General Grant telegraphs, I infer\r\nthat he moved his headquarters about one mile since he sent the first of\r\nthe two despatches.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, April 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nYours to Colonel Bowers about the Secretary of War is shown to me. He is\r\nnot here, nor have I any notice that he is coming. I presume the mistake\r\ncomes of the fact that the Secretary of State was here. He started back to\r\nWashington this morning. I have your two despatches of this morning, and\r\nam anxious to hear from Sheridan.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, April 1, 1865. 12.50 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Washington, D.C.:\r\n\r\nI have had two despatches from General Grant since my last to you, but\r\nthey contain little additional, except that Sheridan also had pretty hot\r\nwork yesterday, that infantry was sent to his support during the night,\r\nand that he (Grant) has not since heard from Sheridan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln has started home, and I will thank you to see that our\r\ncoachman is at the Arsenal wharf at eight o'clock to-morrow morning, there\r\nto wait until she arrives.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., April, 1865. 5.30?.M.\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State, Fort Monroe:\r\n\r\nDespatch just received, showing that Sheridan, aided by Warren, had, at 2\r\nP.M., pushed the enemy back, so as to retake the Five Forks and bring his\r\nown headquarters up to J. Boisseau's. The Five Forks were barricaded by\r\nthe enemy and carried by Devin's division of cavalry. This part of the\r\nenemy seem to now be trying to work along the White Oak road, to join the\r\nmain force in front of Grant, while Sheridan and Warren are pressing them\r\nas closely as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT. CITY POINT, April 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nYours showing Sheridan's success of to-day is just received and highly\r\nappreciated. Having no great deal to do here, I am still sending the\r\nsubstance of your despatches to the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., April 2, 1865. 8.30 A.M. (Received 9 A.M.)\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN, Executive Mansion:\r\n\r\nLast night General Grant telegraphed that General Sheridan with his\r\ncavalry and the Fifth Corps had captured three brigades of infantry, a\r\ntrain of wagons, and several batteries, prisoners amounting to several\r\nthousand. This morning General Grant having ordered an attack along the\r\nwhole line telegraphs as follows.\r\n\r\nRobert yesterday wrote a little cheerful note to Captain Penrose, which is\r\nall he has heard of him since you left.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAMS TO SECRETARY STANTON. CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 2, 1865. 8.30\r\nA.M.\r\n\r\nHON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nLast night General Grant telegraphed that General Sheridan, with his\r\ncavalry and the Fifth Corps, had captured three brigades of infantry, a\r\ntrain of wagons, and several batteries; the prisoners amounting to several\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nThis morning General Grant, having ordered an attack along the whole line,\r\ntelegraphs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Both Wright and Parke got through the enemy's lines. The battle now\r\nrages furiously. General Sheridan, with his cavalry, the Fifth corps, and\r\nMiles's Division of the Second Corps, which was sent to him this morning,\r\nis now sweeping down from the west.\r\n\r\n\"All now looks highly favorable. General Ord is engaged, but I have not\r\nyet heard the result in his front.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, April 1. 11.00 A.M.\r\n\r\nDespatches are frequently coming in. All is going on finely. Generals\r\nParke, Wright, and Ord's lines are extending from the Appomattox to\r\nHatcher's Run. They have all broken through the enemy's intrenched lines,\r\ntaking some forts, guns, and prisoners. Sheridan, with his own cavalry,\r\nthe Fifth Corps, and part of the Second, is coming in from the west on the\r\nenemy's flank. Wright is already tearing up the Southside Railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 2. 2 P.M.\r\n\r\nAt 10.45 A.M. General Grant telegraphs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Everything has been carried from the left of the Ninth Corps. The Sixth\r\nCorps alone captured more than three thousand prisoners. The Second and\r\nTwenty-fourth Corps captured forts, guns, and prisoners from the enemy,\r\nbut I cannot tell the numbers. We are now closing around the works of the\r\nline immediately enveloping Petersburg. All looks remarkably well. I\r\nhave not yet heard from Sheridan. His headquarters have been moved up\r\nto Banks's house, near the Boydton road, about three miles southwest of\r\nPetersburg.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 2. 8.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nAt 4.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are now up and have a continuous line of troops, and in a few hours\r\nwill be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the river\r\nabove. The whole captures since the army started out will not amount to\r\nless than twelve thousand men, and probably fifty pieces of artillery. I\r\ndo not know the number of men and guns accurately, however. A portion of\r\nFoster's Division, Twenty Fourth Corps, made a most gallant charge this\r\nafternoon, and captured a very important fort from the enemy, with its\r\nentire garrison. All seems well with us, and everything is quiet just\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN. CITY POINT, VA., April 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nMRS. LINCOLN:\r\n\r\nAt 4.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphs that he has Petersburg\r\ncompletely enveloped from river below to river above, and has captured,\r\nsince he started last Wednesday, about twelve thousand prisoners and fifty\r\nguns. He suggests that I shall go out and see him in the morning, which I\r\nthink I will do. Tad and I are both well, and will be glad to see you and\r\nyour party here at the time you name.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

At your kind suggestion I\r\nthink I will meet you to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 3, 1865.8.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nHON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nThis morning Lieutenant-General Grant reports Petersburg evacuated, and he\r\nis confident that Richmond also is. He is pushing forward to cut off, if\r\npossible, the retreating rebel army.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., April 3, 1865. 5 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nYours received. Thanks for your caution, but I have already been to\r\nPetersburg. Staid with General Grant an hour and a half and returned here.\r\nIt is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and I think I will go\r\nthere to-morrow. I will take care of myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

STANTON, Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nGeneral Weitzel telegraphs from Richmond that of railroad stock he found\r\nthere twenty-eight locomotives, forty-four passenger and baggage cars, and\r\none hundred and six freight cars. At 3.30 this evening General Grant,\r\nfrom Sutherland's Station, ten miles from Petersburg toward Burkevllle,\r\ntelegraphs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"General Sheridan picked up twelve hundred prisoners to-day, and from\r\nthree hundred to five hundred more have been gathered by other troops. The\r\nmajority of the arms that were left in the hands of the remnant of Lee's\r\narmy are now scattered between Richmond and where his troops are. The\r\ncountry is also full of stragglers; the line of retreat marked with\r\nartillery, ammunition, burned or charred wagons, caissons, ambulances,\r\netc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, APRIL 5, 1865. (Received 11.55 PM.)\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF STATE:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day received. I think there is no probability of my remaining\r\nhere more than two days longer. If that is too long come down. I passed\r\nlast night at Richmond and have just returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, CITY POINT, April 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, in the Field:\r\n\r\nSecretary Seward was thrown from his carriage yesterday and seriously\r\ninjured. This, with other matters, will take me to Washington soon. I was\r\nat Richmond yesterday and the day before, when and where Judge Campbell,\r\nwho was with Messrs. Hunter and Stephens in February, called on me, and\r\nmade such representations as induced me to put in his hands an informal\r\npaper, repeating the propositions in my letter of instructions to Mr.\r\nSeward, which you remember, and adding that if the war be now further\r\npersisted in by the rebels, confiscated property shall at the least bear\r\nthe additional cost, and that confiscation shall be remitted to the people\r\nof any State which will now promptly and in good faith withdraw its troops\r\nand other support from resistance to the Government.\r\n\r\nJudge Campbell thought it not impossible that the rebel legislature of\r\nVirginia would do the latter if permitted; and accordingly I addressed a\r\nprivate letter to General Weitzel, with permission to Judge Campbell to\r\nsee it, telling him (General Weitzel) that if they attempt this, to permit\r\nand protect them, unless they attempt something hostile to the United\r\nStates, in which case to give them notice and time to leave, and to arrest\r\nany remaining after such time.\r\n\r\nI do not think it very probable that anything win come of this, but I\r\nhave thought best to notify you so that if you should see signs you may\r\nunderstand them.\r\n\r\nFrom your recent despatches it seems that you are pretty effectually\r\nwithdrawing the Virginia troops from opposition to the Government. Nothing\r\nthat I have done, or probably shall do, is to delay, hinder, or interfere\r\nwith your work.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. WEITZEL.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES CITY POINT, April 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL WEITZEL, Richmond, Va.:\r\n\r\nIt has been intimated to me that the gentlemen who have acted as the\r\nlegislature of Virginia in support of the rebellion may now desire to\r\nassemble at Richmond and take measures to withdraw the Virginia troops and\r\nother support from resistance to the General Government. If they attempt\r\nit, give them permission and protection, until, if at all, they attempt\r\nsome action hostile to the United States, in which case you will notify\r\nthem, give them reasonable time to leave, and at the end of which time\r\narrest any who remain. Allow Judge Campbell to see this, but do not make\r\nit public.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nCITY POINT, VA., April 7, 1865 (Received 10.30 AM.)\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nAt 11.15 P.M. yesterday at Burkesville Station, General Grant sends me the\r\nfollowing from General Sheridan:\r\n\r\n\"April 6, 11.15 P.M.\r\n\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to report that the enemy made a stand at the intersection\r\nof the Burks Station road with the road upon which they were retreating.\r\nI attacked them with two divisions of the Sixth Army Corps and routed them\r\nhandsomely, making a connection with the cavalry. I am still pressing on\r\nwith both cavalry and infantry.

He had appeared before a larger audience than this\r\none to-day, and he would repeat what he then said, namely, he supposed\r\nowing to the great, good news, there would be some demonstration. He would\r\nprefer to-morrow evening, when he should be quite willing, and he hoped\r\nready, to say something. He desired to be particular, because every thing\r\nhe said got into print. Occupying the position he did, a mistake would\r\nproduce harm, and therefore he wanted to be careful not to make a mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. H.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST PUBLIC ADDRESS,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 11, 1865\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS--We meet this evening not in sorrow, but in gladness of\r\nheart. The evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the\r\nprincipal insurgent army, give hope of a righteous and speedy peace, whose\r\njoyous expression cannot be restrained. In the midst of this, however, He\r\nfrom whom blessings flow must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nA call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared, and will be duly\r\npromulgated. Nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of\r\nrejoicing be overlooked. Their honors must not be parceled out with\r\nothers. I myself was near the front, and had the pleasure of transmitting\r\nmuch of the good news to you. But no part of the honor for plan or\r\nexecution is mine. To General Grant, his skillful officers, and brave men,\r\nall belongs. The gallant navy stood ready, but was not in reach to take\r\nactive part. By these recent successes, the reinauguration of the national\r\nauthority--reconstruction which has had a large share of thought from the\r\nfirst, is pressed much more closely upon our attention. It is fraught with\r\ngreat difficulty. Unlike a case of war between independent nations, there\r\nis no authorized organ for us to treat with--no one man has authority to\r\ngive up the rebellion for any other man. We simply must begin with\r\nand mould from disorganized and discordant elements. Nor is it a small\r\nadditional embarrassment that we, the loyal people, differ among ourselves\r\nas to the mode, manner, and measure of reconstruction. As a general rule,\r\nI abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself, Wishing not to\r\nbe provoked by that to which I cannot properly offer an answer. In spite\r\nof this precaution, however, it comes to my knowledge that I am much\r\ncensured for some supposed agency in setting up and seeking to sustain the\r\nnew State government of Louisiana. In this I have done just so much and no\r\nmore than the public knows. In the Annual Message of December, 1863, and\r\nthe accompanying proclamation, I presented a plan of reconstruction,\r\nas the phrase goes, which I promised, if adopted by any State, would be\r\nacceptable to and sustained by the Executive Government of the nation. I\r\ndistinctly stated that this was not the only plan that might possibly be\r\nacceptable, and I also distinctly protested that the Executive claimed\r\nno right to say when or whether members should be admitted to seats in\r\nCongress from such States. This plan was in advance submitted to the then\r\nCabinet, and approved by every member of it. One of them suggested that I\r\nshould then and in that connection apply the Emancipation Proclamation to\r\nthe theretofore excepted parts of Virginia and Louisiana; that I should\r\ndrop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed people, and that I\r\nshould omit the protest against my own power in regard to the admission\r\nof members of Congress. But even he approved every part and parcel of the\r\nplan which has since been employed or touched by the action of Louisiana.\r\nThe new constitution of Louisiana, declaring emancipation for the whole\r\nState, practically applies the proclamation to the part previously\r\nexcepted. It does not adopt apprenticeship for freed people, and is\r\nsilent, as it could not well be otherwise, about the admission of members\r\nto Congress. So that, as it applied to Louisiana, every member of the\r\nCabinet fully approved the plan. The message went to Congress, and I\r\nreceived many commendations of the plan, written and verbal, and not\r\na single objection to it from any professed emancipationist came to my\r\nknowledge until after the news reached Washington that the people of\r\nLouisiana had begun to move in accordance with it. From about July, 1862,\r\nI had corresponded with different persons supposed to be interested in\r\nseeking a reconstruction of a State government for Louisiana. When the\r\nmessage of 1863, with the plan before mentioned, reached New Orleans,\r\nGeneral Banks wrote me that he was confident that the people, with his\r\nmilitary co-operation, would reconstruct substantially on that plan. I\r\nwrote to him and some of them to try it. They tried it, and the result\r\nis known. Such has been my only agency in getting up the Louisiana\r\ngovernment. As to sustaining it my promise is out, as before stated. But,\r\nas bad promises are better broken than kept, I shall treat this as a bad\r\npromise and break it, whenever I shall be convinced that keeping it is\r\nadverse to the public interest; but I have not yet been so convinced. I\r\nhave been shown a letter on this subject, supposed to be an able one,\r\nin which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be\r\ndefinitely fixed upon the question whether the seceded States, so called,\r\nare in the Union or out of it. It would perhaps add astonishment to\r\nhis regret were he to learn that since I have found professed Union men\r\nendeavoring to answer that question, I have purposely forborne any public\r\nexpression upon it. As appears to me, that question has not been nor yet\r\nis a practically material one, and that any discussion of it, while it\r\nthus remains practically immaterial, could have no effect other than the\r\nmischievous one of dividing our friends. As yet, whatever it may become,\r\nthat question is bad as the basis of a controversy, and good for nothing\r\nat all--a merely pernicious abstraction. We all agree that the seceded\r\nStates, so called, are out of their proper practical relation with the\r\nUnion, and that the sole object of the Government, civil and military, in\r\nregard to those States, is to again get them into their proper practical\r\nrelation. I believe that it is not only possible, but in fact easier, to\r\ndo this without deciding or even considering whether those States have\r\never been out of the Union, than with it. Finding themselves safely at\r\nhome, it would be utterly immaterial whether they had been abroad. Let\r\nus all join in doing the acts necessary to restore the proper practical\r\nrelations between these States and the Union, and each forever after\r\ninnocently indulge his own opinion whether, in doing the acts he\r\nbrought the States from without into the Union, or only gave them proper\r\nassistance, they never having been out of it. The amount of constituency,\r\nso to speak, on which the Louisiana government rests, would be more\r\nsatisfactory to all if it contained fifty thousand, or thirty thousand, or\r\neven twenty thousand, instead of twelve thousand, as it does. It is also\r\nunsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the\r\ncolored man. I would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very\r\nintelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers. Still, the\r\nquestion is not whether the Louisiana government, as it stands, is quite\r\nall that is desirable. The question is, Will it be wiser to take it as\r\nit is and help to improve it, or to reject and disperse? Can Louisiana be\r\nbrought into proper practical relation with the Union sooner by sustaining\r\nor by discarding her new State government? Some twelve thousand voters\r\nin the heretofore Slave State of Louisiana have sworn allegiance to the\r\nUnion, assumed to be the rightful political power of the State,\r\nheld elections, organized a State government, adopted a Free State\r\nconstitution, giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and\r\nwhite, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective franchise\r\nupon the colored man. This Legislature has already voted to ratify the\r\nConstitutional Amendment recently passed by Congress, abolishing slavery\r\nthroughout the nation. These twelve thousand persons are thus fully\r\ncommitted to the Union and to perpetuate freedom in the State--committed\r\nto the very things, and nearly all things, the nation wants--and they ask\r\nthe nation's recognition and its assistance to make good this committal.\r\nNow, if we reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize and\r\ndisperse them. We, in fact, say to the white man: You are worthless or\r\nworse; we will neither help you nor be helped by you. To the blacks we\r\nsay: This cup of liberty which these, your old masters, held to your\r\nlips, we will dash from you, and leave you to the chances of gathering the\r\nspilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when, where,\r\nand how. If this course, discouraging and paralyzing both white and black,\r\nhas any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper practical relations with\r\nthe Union, I have so far been unable to perceive it. If, on the contrary,\r\nwe recognize and sustain the new government of Louisiana, the converse\r\nof all this is made true. We encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of\r\ntwelve thousand to adhere to their work, and argue for it, and proselyte\r\nfor it, and fight for it, and feed it, and grow it, and ripen it to a\r\ncomplete success. The colored man, too, in seeing all united for him, is\r\ninspired with vigilance, and energy, and daring to the same end. Grant\r\nthat he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by\r\nsaving the already advanced steps towards it, than by running backward\r\nover them? Concede that the new government of Louisiana is only to what\r\nit should be as the egg is to the fowl, we shall sooner have the fowl by\r\nhatching the egg than by smashing it. Again, if we reject Louisiana, we\r\nalso reject one vote in favor of the proposed amendment to the National\r\nConstitution. To meet this proposition, it has been argued that no more\r\nthan three fourths of those States which have not attempted secession are\r\nnecessary to validly ratify the amendment. I do not commit myself against\r\nthis, further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable,\r\nand sure to be persistently questioned, while a ratification by three\r\nfourths of all the States would be unquestioned and unquestionable.\r\nI repeat the question, Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical\r\nrelation with the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new\r\nState government? What has been said of Louisiana will apply to other\r\nStates. And yet so great peculiarities pertain to each State, and such\r\nimportant and sudden changes occur in the same State, and withal so new\r\nand unprecedented is the whole case, that no exclusive and inflexible plan\r\ncan safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals. Such exclusive\r\nand inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement. Important\r\nprinciples may and must be inflexible. In the present situation as the\r\nphrase goes, it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people\r\nof the South. I am considering, and shall not fail to act, when satisfied\r\nthat action will be proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. WEITZEL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., April 12, 1865. MAJOR-GENERAL WEITZEL, Richmond, Va.:\r\n\r\nI have seen your despatch to Colonel Hardie about the matter of prayers.\r\nI do not remember hearing prayers spoken of while I was in Richmond; but I\r\nhave no doubt you have acted in what appeared to you to be the spirit\r\nand temper manifested by me while there. Is there any sign of the rebel\r\nlegislature coming together on the understanding of my letter to you? If\r\nthere is any such sign, inform me what it is; if there is no such sign,\r\nyou may withdraw the offer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. WEITZEL. WASHINGTON, D.C., April 12, 1865.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL WEITZEL, Richmond, Va.:\r\n\r\nI have just seen Judge Campbell's letter to you of the 7th. He assumes,\r\nas appears to me, that I have called the insurgent legislature of\r\nVirginia together, as the rightful legislature of the State, to settle all\r\ndifferences with the United States. I have done no such thing. I spoke of\r\nthem, not as a legislature, but as \"the gentlemen who have acted as\r\nthe legislature of Virginia in support of the rebellion.\" I did this\r\non purpose to exclude the assumption that I was recognizing them as a\r\nrightful body. I deal with them as men having power de facto to do a\r\nspecific thing, to wit: \"To withdraw the Virginia troops and other support\r\nfrom resistance to the General Government,\" for which, in the paper handed\r\nJudge Campbell, I promised a specific equivalent, to wit: a remission to\r\nthe people of the State, except in certain cases, of the confiscation of\r\ntheir property. I meant this, and no more. Inasmuch, however, as Judge\r\nCampbell misconstrues this, and is still pressing for an armistice,\r\ncontrary to the explicit statement of the paper I gave him, and\r\nparticularly as General Grant has since captured the Virginia troops, so\r\nthat giving a consideration for their withdrawal is no longer applicable,\r\nlet my letter to you and the paper to Judge Campbell both be withdrawn,\r\nor countermanded, and he be notified of it. Do not now allow them to\r\nassemble, but if any have come, allow them safe return to their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW WITH SCHUYLER COLFAX ON THE MORNING OF APRIL 14, 1865.\r\n\r\nMr. Colfax, I want you to take a message from me to the miners whom you\r\nvisit. I have very large ideas of the mineral wealth of our nation. I\r\nbelieve it practically inexhaustible. It abounds all over the Western\r\ncountry, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and its development\r\nhas scarcely commenced. During the war, when we were adding a couple of\r\nmillions of dollars every day to our national debt, I did not care about\r\nencouraging the increase in the volume of our precious metals. We had the\r\ncountry to save first. But now that the rebellion is overthrown, and we\r\nknow pretty nearly the amount of our national debt, the more gold and\r\nsilver we mine, we make the payment of that debt so much the easier.\r\n\"Now,\" said he, speaking with more emphasis, \"I am going to encourage that\r\nin every possible way. We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded\r\nsoldiers, and many have feared that their return home in such great\r\nnumbers might paralyze industry, by furnishing, suddenly, a greater supply\r\nof labor than there will be demand for. I am going to try to attract them\r\nto the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges, where there is room enough\r\nfor all. Immigration, which even the war has not stopped, will land upon\r\nour shores hundreds of thousands more per year from overcrowded Europe.\r\nI intend to point them to the gold and silver that wait for them in the\r\nWest. Tell the miners for me, that I shall promote their interests to the\r\nutmost of my ability; because their prosperity is the prosperity of the\r\nnation; and,\" said he, his eye kindling with enthusiasm, \"we shall prove,\r\nin a very few years, that we are indeed the treasury of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL VAN ALLEN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 14, 1865\r\n\r\nGENERAL VAN ALLEN:\r\n\r\nI intend to adopt the advice of my friends and use due precaution....\r\nI thank you for the assurance you give me that I shall be supported by\r\nconservative men like yourself, in the efforts I may make to restore the\r\nUnion, so as to make it, to use your language, a Union of hearts and hands\r\nas well as of States.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN'S LAST WRITTEN WORDS\r\n\r\nAllow Mr. Ashmer and friend to come in at 9 A.M. to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. April 14, 1865",
