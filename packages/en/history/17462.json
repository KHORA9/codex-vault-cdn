APPLETON AND COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe task of compressing into one small volume suitable sketches of the\r\nmore famous Italian and French composers has been, in view of the extent\r\nof the field and the wealth of material, a somewhat embarrassing one,\r\nespecially as the purpose was to make the sketches of interest to\r\nthe general music-loving public, and not merely to the critic and\r\nthe scholar. The plan pursued has been to devote the bulk of space to\r\ncomposers of the higher rank, and to pass over those less known with\r\nsuch brief mention as sufficed to outline their lives and fix their\r\nplace in the history of music. In gathering the facts embodied in\r\nthese musical sketches, the author acknowledges his obligations to the\r\nfollowing works: Hullah's \"History of Modern Music\"; Fétis's \"Biographie\r\nUniverselle des Musiciens\"; Clementi's \"Biographie des Musiciens\";\r\nHogarth's \"History of the Opera\"; Sutherland Edwards's \"History of the\r\nOpera\"; Schlüter's \"History of Music\"; Chorley's \"Thirty Years' Musical\r\nReminiscences\"; Stendhalls \"Vie de Rossini\"; Bellasys's \"Memorials of\r\nCherubini\"; Grove's \"Musical Dictionary\"; Crowest's \"Musical Anecdotes\";\r\nand the various articles in the standard cyclopædias.\r\n\r\n\"The Great Italian and French Composers\" is a companion work to \"The\r\nGreat German Composers,\" which was published earlier in the series in\r\nwhich the present volume appears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nPalestrixa\r\n\r\nPiccini, Paisiello, and Cimarosa\r\n\r\nRossini\r\n\r\nDonizetti and Bellini\r\n\r\nVerdi\r\n\r\nCherubini and his Predecessors\r\n\r\nMeiül, Spontini, and Halévy\r\n\r\nBoïeldieu and Auber\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer\r\n\r\nGounod and Thomas\r\n\r\nBerlioz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ITALIAN AND FRENCH COMPOSERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALESTRINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands share other glories than that of having nursed the most\r\nindomitable spirit of liberty known to mediteval Europe. The fine\r\nas well as the industrial arts found among this remarkable people,\r\ndistinguished by Erasmus as possessed of the _patientia laboris_,\r\nan eager and passionate culture. The early contributions of the Low\r\nCountries to the growth of the pictorial art are well known to all. But\r\nto most it will be a revelation that the Belgian school of music was the\r\ngreat fructifying influence of the fifteenth century, to which Italy and\r\nGermany owe a debt not easily measured. The art of interweaving parts\r\nand that science of sound known as counterpoint were placed by this\r\nschool of musical scholars and workers on a solid basis, which enabled\r\nthe great composers who came after them to build their beautiful tone\r\nfabrics in forms of imperishable beauty and symmetry. For a long time\r\nmost of the great Italian churches had Belgian chapel-masters, and\r\nthe value of their example and teachings was vital in its relation to\r\nItalian music.\r\n\r\nThe last great master among the Belgians, and, after Palestrina,\r\nthe greatest of the sixteenth century, was Orlando di Lasso, born in\r\nHainault, in the year 1520. His life of a little more than three score\r\nyears and ten was divided between Italy and Germany. He left the deep\r\nimprint of his severe style, though but a young man, on his Italian\r\n_confrères_, and the young Palestrina owed to him much of the largeness\r\nand beauty of form through which he poured his genius in the creation of\r\nsuch works as have given him so distinct a place in musical history. The\r\npope created Orlando di Lasso Knight of the Golden Spur, and sought to\r\nkeep him in Italy. Unconcerned as to fame, the gentle, peaceful musician\r\nlived for his art alone, and the flattering expressions of the great\r\nwere not so much enjoyed as endured by him. A musical historian,\r\nHeimsoeth, says of him: \"He is the brilliant master of the North,\r\ngreat and sublime in sacred composition, of inexhaustible invention,\r\ndisplaying much breadth, variety, and depth in his treatment; he\r\ndelights in full and powerful harmonies, yet, after all--owing to an\r\nexistence passed in journeys, as well as service at court, and occupied\r\nat the same time with both sacred and secular music--he came short of\r\nthat lofty, solemn tone which pervades the works of the great master of\r\nthe South, Palestrina, who with advancing years restricted himself more\r\nand more to church music.\" Of the celebrated penitential psalms of Di\r\nLasso, it is said that Charles IX. of France ordered them to be written\r\n\"in order to obtain rest for his soul after the horrible massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew.\" Aside from his works, this musician has a claim on\r\nfame through his lasting improvements in musical form and method. He\r\nilluminated, and at the same time closed, the great epoch of Belgian\r\nascendancy, which had given three hundred musicians of great science\r\nto the times in which they lived. So much has been said of Orlando di\r\nLasso, for he was the model and Mentor of the greatest of early church\r\ncomposers, Palestrina.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe melodious and fascinating style, soon to give birth to the\r\ncharacteristic genius of the opera, was as yet unborn, though dormant.\r\nIn Rome, the chief seat of the Belgian art, the exclusive study of\r\ntechnical skill had frozen music to a mere formula. The Gregorian\r\nchant had become so overladen with mere embellishments as to make the\r\nprescribed church-form difficult of recognition in its borrowed garb,\r\nfor it had become a mere jumble of sound. Musicians, indeed, carried\r\ntheir profanation so far as to take secular melodies as the themes for\r\nmasses and motetts. These were often called by their profane titles. So\r\nthe name of a love-sonnet or a drinking-song would sometimes be attached\r\nto a miserere. The council of Trent, in 1562, cut at these evils with\r\nsweeping axe, and the solemn anathemas of the church fathers roused the\r\ncreative powei's of the subject of this sketch, who raised his art to\r\nan independent national existence, and made it rank with sculpture and\r\npainting, which had already reached their zenith in Leonardo Da Vinci,\r\nRaphael, Correggio, Titian, and Michel Angelo. Henceforth Italian music\r\nwas to be a vigorous, fruitful stock.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Perluigui Aloisio da Palestrina was born at Palestrina, the\r\nancient Præneste, in 1524.*\r\n\r\n     * Our composer, as was common with artists and scholars in\r\n     those days, took the name of his natal town, and by this he\r\n     is known to fame. Old documents also give him the old Latin\r\n     name of the town with the personal ending.\r\n\r\nThe memorials of his childhood are scanty. We know but little except\r\nthat his parents were poor peasants, and that he learned the rudiments\r\nof literature and music as a choir-singer, a starting-point so common in\r\nthe lives of great composers. In 1540 he went to Rome and studied in\r\nthe school of Goudimel, a stern Huguenot Fleming, tolerated in the papal\r\ncapital on account of his superior science and method of teaching, and\r\nafterward murdered at Lyons on the day of the Paris massacre. Palestrina\r\ngrasped the essential doctrines of the school without adopting its\r\nmannerisms. At the age of thirty he published his first compositions,\r\nand dedicated them to the reigning pontiff, Julius III. In the formation\r\nof his style, which moved with such easy, original grace within the old\r\nprescribed rules, he learned much from the personal influence and advice\r\nof Orlando di Lasso, his warm friend and constant companion during these\r\nearlier days.\r\n\r\nSeveral of his compositions, written at this time, are still performed\r\nin Rome on Good Friday, and Goethe and Mendelssohn have left their\r\neloquent tributes to the impression made on them by music alike simple\r\nand sublime. The pope was highly pleased with Palestrina's noble music,\r\nand appointed him one of the papal choristers, then regarded as a great\r\nhonor. But beyond Rome the new light of music was but little known.\r\nThe Council of Trent, in their first indignation at the abuse of church\r\nmusic, had resolved to abolish everything but the simple Gregorian\r\nchants, but the remonstrances of the Emperor Ferdinand and the Roman\r\ncardinals stayed the austere fiat. The final decision was made to rest\r\non a new composition of Palestrina, who was permitted to demonstrate\r\nthat the higher forms of musical art were consistent with the\r\nsolemnities of church worship.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were directed to the young musician, for the very existence\r\nof his art was at stake. The motto of his first mass, \"Illumina oculos\r\nmeos,\" shows the pious enthusiasm with which he undertook his labors.\r\nInstead of one, he composed three six-part masses. The third of these\r\nexcited such admiration that the pope exclaimed in raptures, \"It is John\r\nwho gives us here in this earthly Jerusalem a foretaste of that new song\r\nwhich the holy Apostle John realized in the heavenly Jerusalem in his\r\nprophetic trance.\" This is now known as the \"mass of Pope Marcel,\" in\r\nhonor of a former patron of Palestrina.\r\n\r\nA new pope, Paul IV., on ascending the pontifical throne, carried his\r\ndesire of reforming abuses to fanaticism. He insisted on all the papal\r\nchoristers being clerical. Palestrina had married early in life a Roman\r\nlady, of whom all we know is that her name was Lucretia. Four children\r\nhad blessed the union, and the composer's domestic happiness became a\r\nbar to his temporal preferment. With two others he was dismissed from\r\nthe chapel because he was a layman, and a trifling pension allowed him.\r\nTwo months afterward, though, he was appointed chapel-master of St.\r\nJohn Lateran. His works now succeeded each other rapidly, and different\r\ncollections of his masses were dedicated to the crowned heads of Europe.\r\nIn 1571 he was appointed chapel-master of the Vatican, and Pope Gregory\r\nXIII. gave special charge of the reform of sacred music to Palestrina.\r\n\r\nThe death of the composer's wife, whom he idolized, in 1580, was a blow\r\nfrom which he never recovered. In his latter days he was afflicted with\r\ngreat poverty, for the positions he held were always more honorable than\r\nlucrative. Mental depression and physical weakness burdened the last few\r\nyears of his pious and gentle life, and he died after a lingering and\r\nsevere illness. The register of the pontifical chapel contains this\r\nentry: \"February 2, 1594. This morning died the most excellent musician,\r\nSignor Giovanni Palestrina, our dear companion and _maestro di capella_\r\nof St. Peter's church, whither his funeral was attended not only by all\r\nthe musicians of Rome, but by an infinite concourse of people, when his\r\nown 'Libera me, Domine' was sung by the whole college.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the simple and meagre records of the life of the composer, who\r\ncarved and laid the foundation of the superstructure of Italian music;\r\nwho, viewed in connection with his times and their limitations, must be\r\nregarded as one of the great creative minds in his art; who shares with\r\nSebastian Bach the glory of having built an imperishable base for the\r\nlabors of his successors.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nPalestrixa left a great mass of compositions, all glowing with the fire\r\nof genius, only part of which have been published. His simple life was\r\ndevoted to musical labor, and passed without romance, diversion, or\r\nexcitement. His works are marked by utter absence of contrast and\r\ncolor. Without dramatic movement, they are full of melody and majesty, a\r\nmajesty serene, unruffled by the slightest suggestion of human passion.\r\nVoices are now and then used for individual expression, but either in\r\nunison or harmony. As in all great church music, the chorus is the key\r\nof the work. The general judgment of musicians agrees that repose and\r\nenjoyment are more characteristic of this music than that of any\r\nother master. The choir of the Sistine chapel, by the inheritance of\r\nlong-cherished tradition, is the most perfect exponent of the\r\nPalestrina music. During the annual performance of the \"Improperie\" and\r\n\"Lamentations,\" the altar and walls are despoiled of their pictures and\r\nornaments, and everything is draped in black. The cardinals dressed in\r\nserge, no incense, no candles: the whole scene is a striking picture of\r\ntrouble and desolation. The faithful come in two by two and bow before\r\nthe cross, while the sad music reverberates through the chapel arches.\r\nThis powerful appeal to the imagination, of course, lends greater power\r\nto the musical effect. But all minds who have felt the lift and beauty\r\nof these compositions have acknowledged how far they soar above words\r\nand creeds, and the picturesque framework of a liturgy.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn, in a letter to Zelter on the Palestrina music as heard in\r\nthe Sistine chapel, says that nothing could exceed the effect of the\r\nblending of the voices, the prolonged tones gradually merging from one\r\nnote and chord to another, softly swelling, decreasing, at last dying\r\nout. \"They understand,\" he writes, \"how to bring out and place each\r\ntrait in the most delicate light, without giving it undue prominence;\r\none chord gently melts into another. The ceremony at the same time is\r\nsolemn and imposing; deep silence prevails in the chapel, only broken\r\nby the reechoing Greek 'holy,' sung with unvarying sweetness and\r\nexpression.\" The composer Paër was so impressed with the wonderful\r\nbeauty of the music and the performance, that he exclaimed, \"This is\r\nindeed divine music, such as I have long sought for, and my imagination\r\nwas never able to realize, but which, I knew, must exist.\"\r\n\r\nPalestrina's versatility and genius enabled him to lift ecclesiastical\r\nmusic out of the rigidity and frivolity characterizing on either\r\nhand the opposing ranks of those that preceded him, and to embody\r\nthe religious spirit in works of the highest art. He transposed the\r\necclesiastical melody (_canto fermo_) from the tenor to the soprano\r\n(thus rendering it more intelligible to the ear), and created that\r\nglorious thing choir song, with its refined harmony, that noble music\r\nof which his works are the models, and the papal chair the oracle. No\r\nindividual preeminence is ever allowed to disturb and weaken the ideal\r\natmosphere of the whole work. However Palestrina's successors have aimed\r\nto imitate his effects, they have, with the exception of Cherubini,\r\nfailed for the most part; for every peculiar genus of art is the result\r\nof innate genuine inspiration, and the spontaneous growth of the age\r\nwhich produces it. As a parent of musical form he was the protagonist\r\nof Italian music, both sacred and secular, and left an admirable model,\r\nwhich even the new school of opera so soon to rise found it necessary to\r\nfollow in the construction of harmony. The splendid and often licentious\r\nmusic of the theatre built its most worthy effects on the work of the\r\npious composer, who lived, labored, and died in an atmosphere of almost\r\nanchorite sanctity.\r\n\r\nThe great disciples of his school, Nannini and Allegri, continued his\r\nwork, and the splendid \"Miserere\" of the latter was regarded as such\r\nan inestimable treasure that no copy of it was allowed to go out of the\r\nSistine chapel, till the infant prodigy, Wolfgang Mozart, wrote it out\r\nfrom the memory of a single hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICCINI, PAISIELLO, AND CIMAROSA\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nMusic, as speaking the language of feeling, emotion, and passion, found\r\nits first full expansion in the operatic form. There had been attempts\r\nto represent drama with chorus, founded on the ancient Greek drama, but\r\nit was soon discovered that dialogue and monologue could not be embodied\r\nin choral forms without involving an utter absurdity. The spirit of\r\nthe renaissance had freed poetry, statuary, and painting, from the\r\nmonopolizing elaims of the church. Music, which had become a well\r\nequipped and developed science, could not long rest in a similar\r\nservitude. Though it is not the aim of the author to discuss operatic\r\nhistory, a brief survey of the progress of opera from its birth cannot\r\nbe omitted.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of the entertainments which ripened into Italian opera\r\nbelongs to the last years of the fifteenth century, and was the work\r\nof the brilliant Politian, known as one of the revivalists of Greek\r\nlearning attached to the court of Cosmo de' Medici and his son Lorenzo.\r\nThis was the musical drama of \"Orfeo.\" The story was written in Latin,\r\nand sung in music principally choral, though a few solo phrases were\r\ngiven to the principal characters. It was performed at Rome with great\r\nmagnificence, and Vasari tells us that Peruzzi, the decorator of the\r\npapal theatre, painted such scenery for it that even the great Titian\r\nwas so struck with the _vraisemblance_ of the work that he was not\r\nsatisfied until he had touched the canvas to be sure of its not being in\r\nrelief. We may fancy indeed that the scenery was one great attraction\r\nof the representation. In spite of spasmodic encouragement by the more\r\nliberally minded pontiffs, the general weight of church influence was\r\nagainst the new musical tendency, and the most skilled composers were at\r\nfirst afraid to devote their talents to further its growth.\r\n\r\nWhat musicians did not dare undertake out of dread of the thunderbolts\r\nof the church, a company of _literati_ at Florence commenced in 1580.\r\nThe primary purpose was the revival of Greek art, including music. This\r\nassociation, in conjunction with the Medicean Academy, laid down the\r\nrule that distinct individuality of expression in music was to be sought\r\nfor. As results, quickly came musical drama with recitative (modern form\r\nof the Greek chorus) and solo melody for characteristic parts of the\r\nlegend or story. Out of this beginning swiftly grew the opera. Composers\r\nin the new form sprung up in various parts of Italy, though Naples,\r\nVenice, and Florence continued to be its centres.\r\n\r\nBetween 1637 and 1700, there were performed three hundred operas at\r\nVenice alone. An account of the performance of \"Berenice,\" composed by\r\nDomenico Freschi, at Padua, in 1680, dwarfs all our present ideas of\r\nspectacular splendor. In this opera there were choruses of a hundred\r\nvirgins and a hundred soldiers; a hundred horsemen in steel armor; a\r\nhundred performers on trumpets, cornets, sackbuts, drums, flutes, and\r\nother instruments, on horseback and on foot; two lions led by two Turks,\r\nand two elephants led by two Indians; Berenice's triumphal car drawn\r\nby four horses, and six other cars with spoils and prisoners, drawn by\r\ntwelve horses. Among the scenes in the first act was a vast plain\r\nwith two triumphal arches; another with pavilions and tents; a square\r\nprepared for the entrance of the triumphal procession, and a forest\r\nfor the chase. In the second act there were the royal apartments of\r\nBerenice's temple of vengeance, a spacious court with view of the prison\r\nand a covered way with long lines of chariots. In the third act there\r\nwere the royal dressing-room, the stables with a hundred live horses,\r\nporticoes adorned with tapestry, and a great palace in the perspective.\r\nIn the course of the piece there were representations of the hunting of\r\nthe boar, the stag, and the lions. The whole concluded with a huge globe\r\ndescending from the skies, and dividing itself in lesser globes of fire\r\non which stood allegorical figures of fame, honor, nobility, virtue, and\r\nglory. The theatriccal manager had princes and nobles for bankers and\r\nassistants, and they lavished their treasures of art and money to\r\nmake such spectacles as the modern stagemen of London and Paris cannot\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nIn Evelyn's diary there is an entry describing opera at Venice in 1645.\r\n\"This night, having with my lord Bruce taken our places before, we\r\nwent to the opera, where comedies and other plays are represented\r\nin recitative musiq by the most excellent musicians, vocal and\r\ninstrumental, with variety of scenes painted and contrived with no\r\nlesse art of perspective, and machines for flying in the aire, and other\r\nwonderful motions; taken together it is one of the most magnificent and\r\nexpensive diversions the wit of man can invent. The history was Hercules\r\nin Lydia. The sceanes changed thirteen times. The famous voices, Anna\r\nRencia, a Roman and reputed the best treble of women; but there was\r\na Eunuch who in my opinion surpassed her; also a Génoise that in my\r\njudgment sung an incomparable base. They held us by the eyes and ears\r\ntill two o'clock i' the morning.\" Again he writes of the carnival\r\nof 1640: \"The comedians have liberty and the operas are open; witty\r\npasquils are thrown about, and the mountebanks have their stages at\r\nevery corner. The diversion which chiefly took me up was three noble\r\noperas, where were most excellent voices and music, the most celebrated\r\nof which was the famous and beautiful Anna Rencia, whom we invited to\r\na fish dinner after four daies in Lent, when they had given over at the\r\ntheatre.\" Old Evelyn then narrates how he and his noble friend took the\r\nlovely diner out on a junketing, and got shot at with blunderbusses from\r\nthe gondola of an infuriated rival.\r\n\r\nOpera progressed toward a fixed status with a swiftness hardly\r\nparalleled in the history of any art. The soil was rich and fully\r\nprepared for the growth, and the fecund root, once planted, shot into\r\na luxuriant beauty and symmetry, which nothing could check. The Church\r\nwisely gave up its opposition, and henceforth there was nothing to\r\nimpede the progress of a product which spread and naturalized itself\r\nin England, France, and Germany. The inventive genius of Monteverde,\r\nCarissimi, Scarlatti (the friend and rival of Handel), Durante, and\r\nLeonardo Leo, perfected the forms of the opera nearly as we have them\r\ntoday. A line of brilliant composers in the school of Durante and Leo\r\nbrings us down through Pergolesi, Derni, Terradiglias, Jomelli, Traetta,\r\nCiccio di Majo, Galuppi, and Giuglielmi, to the most distinguished of\r\nthe early Italian composers, Nicolo Piccini, who, mostly forgotten\r\nin his works, is principally known to modern fame as the rival of the\r\nmighty Gluck in that art controversy which shook Paris into such bitter\r\nfactions. Yet, overshadowed as Piccini was in the greatness of his\r\nrival, there can be no question of his desert as the most brilliant\r\nornament and exponent of the early operatic school. No greater honor\r\ncould have been paid to him than that he should have been chosen as\r\ntheir champion by the _Italianissimi_ of his day in the battle royal\r\nwith such a giant as Gluck, an honor richly deserved by a composer\r\ndistinguished by multiplicity and beauty of ideas, dramatic insight, and\r\nardent conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nNiccolo Piccini, who was not less than fifty years of age when he left\r\nNaples for the purpose of outrivaling Gluck, was born at Bari, in the\r\nkingdom of Naples, in 1728. His father, also a musician, had destined\r\nhim for holy orders, but Nature made him an artist. His great delight\r\neven as a little child was playing on the harpsichord, which he quickly\r\nlearned. One day the bishop of Bari heard him playing and was amazed\r\nat the power of the little _virtuoso_. \"By all means, send him to a\r\nconservatory of music,\" he said to the elder Piccini. \"If the vocation\r\nof the priesthood brings trials and sacrifices, a musical career is\r\nnot less beset with obstacles. Music demands great perseverance and\r\nincessant labor. It exposes one to many chagrins and toils.\"\r\n\r\nBy the advice of the shrewd prelate, the precocious boy was placed at\r\nthe school of St. Onofrio at the age of fourteen. At first confided to\r\nthe care of an inferior professor, he revolted from the arid teachings\r\nof a mere human machine. Obeying the dictates of his daring fancy,\r\nthough hardly acquainted with the rudiments of composition, he\r\ndetermined to compose a mass. The news got abroad that the little\r\nNiccolo was working on a grand mass, and the great Leo, the chief of the\r\nconservatory, sent for the trembling culprit.\r\n\r\n\"You have written a mass?\" he commenced.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, sir, I could not help it,\" said the timid boy.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see it.\"\r\n\r\nNiccolo brought him the score and all the orchestral parts, and Leo\r\nimmediately went to the concert-room, assembled the orchestra, and\r\ngave them the parts. The boy was ordered to take his place in front and\r\nconduct the performance, which he went through with great agitation.\r\n\r\n\"I pardon you this time,\" said the grave maestro, at the end; \"but, if\r\nyou do such a thing again, I will punish you in such a manner that you\r\nwill remember it as long as you live. Instead of studying the\r\nprinciples of your art, you give yourself up to all the wildness of your\r\nimagination; and, when you have tutored your ill-regulated ideas into\r\nsomething like shape, you produce what you call a mass, and no doubt\r\nthink you have produced a masterpiece.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the boy burst into tears at this rebuke, Leo clasped him in his\r\narms, told him he had great talent, and after that took him under\r\nhis special instruction. Leo was succeeded by Durante, who also loved\r\nPiccini, and looked forward to a future greatness for him. He was wont\r\nto say the others were his pupils, but Piccini was his son. After\r\ntwelve years spent in the conservatory, Piccini commenced an opera. The\r\ndirector of the principal Neapolitan theatre said to Prince Vintimille,\r\nwho introduced the young musician, that his work was sure to be a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n\"How much can you lose by his opera,\" the prince replied, \"supposing it\r\nbe a perfect fiasco?\" The manager named the sum.\r\n\r\n\"There is the money, then,\" replied Piccini's generous patron, handing\r\nhim a purse. \"If the 'Dorme Despetose' (the name of the opera) should\r\nfail, you may keep the money, but otherwise return it to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe friends of Lagroscino, the favorite composer of the day, were\r\nenraged when they heard that the next new work was to be from an obscure\r\nyouth, and they determined to hiss the performance. So great, however,\r\nwas the delight of the public with the freshness and beauty of Piccini's\r\nmusic, that even those who came to condemn remained to applaud. The\r\nreputation of the composer went on increasing until he became the\r\nforemost name of musical Italy, for his fertility of production was\r\nremarkable; and he gave the theatres a brilliant succession of comic and\r\nserious works. In 1758 he produced at Rome his \"Alessandro nell' Indie,\"\r\nwhose success surpassed all that had preceded it, and two years later\r\na still finer masterpiece, \"La Buona Figluola,\" written to a text\r\nfurnished by the poet Goldoni, and founded on the story of Richardson's\r\n\"Pamela.\" This opera was produced at every playhouse on the Italian\r\npeninsula in the course of a few years. A pleasant _mot_ by the Duke of\r\nBrunswick is worth preserving in this connection. Piccini had married a\r\nbeautiful singer named Vicenza Sibilla, and his home was very happy. One\r\nday the German prince visited Piccini, and found him rocking the cradle\r\nof his youngest child, while the eldest was tugging at the paternal\r\ncoat-tails. The mother, being _en déshabille_, ran away at the sight\r\nof a stranger. The duke excused himself for his want of ceremony, and\r\nadded, \"I am delighted to see so great a man living in such simplicity,\r\nand that the author of 'La Bonne Fille' is such a good father.\"\r\nPiccini's placid and pleasant life was destined, however, to pass into\r\nstormy waters.\r\n\r\nHis sway over the stage and the popular preference continued until\r\n1773, when a clique of envious rivals at Rome brought about his first\r\ndisaster. The composer was greatly disheartened, and took to his bed,\r\nfor he was ill alike in mind and body. The turning-point in his career\r\nhad come, and he was to enter into an arena which taxed his powers in a\r\ncontest such as he had not yet dreamed of. His operas having been\r\nheard and admired in France, their great reputation inspired the\r\nroyal favorite, Mme. du Barry, with the hope of finding a successful\r\ncompetitor to the great German composer, patronized by Marie Antoinette.\r\nAccordingly, Piccini was offered an indemnity of six thousand francs,\r\nand a residence in the hotel of the Neapolitan ambassador. When the\r\nItalian arrived in Paris, Gluck was in full sway, the idol of the court\r\nand public, and about to produce his \"Armide.\"\r\n\r\nPiccini was immediately commissioned to write a new opera, and he\r\napplied to the brilliant Marmontel for a libretto. The poet rearranged\r\none of Quinault's tragedies, \"Roland,\" and Piccini undertook the\r\ndifficult task of composing music to words in a language as yet unknown\r\nto him. Marcnontel was his unwearied tutor, and he writes in his\r\n\"Memoirs\" of his pleasant yet arduous task: \"Line by line, word by word,\r\nI had everything to explain; and, when he had laid hold of the meaning\r\nof a passage, I recited it to him, marking the accent, the prosody,\r\nand the cadence of the verses. He listened eagerly, and I had the\r\nsatisfaction to know that what he heard was carefully noted. His\r\ndelicate ear seized so readily the accent of the language and the\r\nmeasure of the poetry, that in his music he never mistook them. It was\r\nan inexpressible pleasure to me to see him practice before my eyes an\r\nart of which before I had no idea. His harmony was in his mind. He wrote\r\nhis airs with the utmost rapidity, and when he had traced its designs,\r\nhe filled up all the parts of the score, distributing the traits of\r\nharmony and melody, just as a skillful painter would distribute on his\r\ncanvas the colors, lights, and shadows of his picture. When all this\r\nwas done, he opened his harpsichord, which he had been using as his\r\nwriting-table; and then I heard an air, a duet, a chorus, complete in\r\nall its parts, with a truth of expression, an intelligence, a unity\r\nof design, a magic in the harmony, which delighted both my ear and my\r\nfeelings.\"\r\n\r\nPiccini's arrival in Paris had been kept a close secret while he was\r\nworking on the new opera, but Abbé du Rollet ferreted it out, and\r\nacquainted Gluck, which piece of news the great German took with\r\nphilosophical disdain. Indeed, he attended the rehearsal of \"Roland;\"\r\nand when his rival, in despair over his ignorance of French and the\r\nstupidity of the orchestra, threw down the baton in despair, Gluck took\r\nit up, and by his magnetic authority brought order out of chaos\r\nand restored tranquillity, a help as much, probably, the fruit of\r\ncondescension and contempt as of generosity.\r\n\r\nStill Gluck was not easy in mind over this intrigue of his enemies, and\r\nwrote a bitter letter, which was made public, and aggravated the war\r\nof public feeling. Epigrams and accusations flew back and forth like\r\nhailstones.*\r\n\r\n     * See article on Gluck in \"Great German Composers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that the Chevalier (Gluck's title) has an Armida and\r\nOrlando in his portfolio?\" said Abbé Arnaud to a Piccinist.\r\n\r\n\"But Piccini is also at work on an Orlando,\" was the retort.\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" returned the abbé, \"for then we shall have an\r\nOrlando and also an Orlandino,\" was the keen answer.\r\n\r\nThe public attention was stimulated by the war of pamphlets, lampoons,\r\nand newspaper articles. Many of the great _literati_ were Piccinists,\r\namong them Marmontel, La Harpe, D'Alembert, etc. Suard du Rollet and\r\nJean Jacques Rousseau fought in the opposite ranks. Although the nation\r\nwas trembling on the verge of revolution, and the French had just lost\r\ntheir hold on the East Indies; though Mirabeau was thundering in the\r\ntribune, and Jacobin clubs were commencing their baleful work, soon to\r\ndrench Paris in blood, all factions and discords were forgotten.\r\nThe question was no longer, \"Is he a Jansenist, a Molinist, an\r\nEncyclopædist, a philosopher, a free-thinker?\" One question only was\r\nthought of: \"Is he a Gluckist or Piccinist?\" and on the answer often\r\ndepended the peace of families and the cement of long-established\r\nfriendships.\r\n\r\nPiccini's opera was a brilliant success with the fickle Parisians,\r\nthough the Gluckists sneered at it as pretty concert music. The retort\r\nwas that Gluck had no gift of melody, though they admitted he had the\r\nadvantage over his rival of making more noise. The poor Italian was so\r\nmuch distressed by the fierce contest that he and his family were in\r\ndespair on the night of the first representation. He could only say\r\nto his weeping wife and son: \"Come, my children, this is unreasonable.\r\nRemember that we are not among savages; we are living with the politest\r\nand kindest nation in Europe. If they do not like me as a musician, they\r\nwill at all events respect me as a man and a stranger.\" To do justico\r\nto Piccini, a mild and timid man, he never took part in the controversy,\r\nand always spoke of his opponent with profound respect and admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette, whom Mme. du Barry and her clique looked on as\r\nPiccini's enemy, astonished both cabals by appointing Piccini her\r\nsinging-master, an unprofitable honor, for he received no pay, and was\r\nobliged to give costly copies of his compositions to the royal family.\r\nHe might have quoted from the Latin poet in regard to this favor from\r\nMarie Antoinette, whose faction in music, among other names, was known\r\nas the Greek party, \"Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.\" *\r\n\r\n     * I fear the Greeks, though offering gifts.\r\n\r\nBeaumarchais, the brilliant author of \"Figaro,\" had found the same\r\ninconvenience when acting as court teacher to the daughters of Louis XV.\r\nThe French kings were parsimonious except when lavishing money on their\r\nvices.\r\n\r\nThe action of the dauphiness, however, paved the way for a\r\nreconciliation between Piccini and Gluck. Berton, the manager of the\r\nopera, gave a luxurious banquet, and the musicians, side by side,\r\npledged each other in libations of champagne. Gluck got confidential\r\nin his cups. \"These French,\" he said, \"are good enough people, but they\r\nmake me laugh. They want us to write songs for them, and they can't\r\nsing.\" In fact the quarrel was not between the musicians but their\r\nadherents. In his own heart Piccini knew his inferiority to Gluck.\r\n\r\nDe Vismes, Berton's successor, proposed that both should write operas on\r\nthe same subject, \"Iphigenia in Tauris,\" and gave him a libretto. \"The\r\nFrench public will have for the first time,\" he said, \"the pleasure of\r\nhearing two operas on the same theme, with the same incidents, the\r\nsame characters, but composed by two great masters of totally different\r\nschools.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" objected the alarmed Italian, \"if Gluck's opera is played first,\r\nthe public will be so delighted that they will not listen to mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"To avoid that catastrophe,\" said the director, \"we will play yours\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Gluck will not permit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you my word of honor,\" said De Vismes, \"that your opera shall be\r\nput in rehearsal and brought out as soon as it is finished.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Piccini had finished his opera, he heard that his rival was\r\nback from Germany with his \"Iphigenia\" completed, and that it was in\r\nrehearsal. The director excused himself on the plea of its being a royal\r\ncommand. Gluck's work was his masterpiece, and produced an unparalleled\r\nsensation among the Parisians. Even his enemies were silenced, and La\r\nHarpe said it was the _chef d'oeuvre_ of the world. Piccini's work,\r\nwhen produced, was admired, but it stood no chance with the profound,\r\nserious, and wonderfully dramatic composition of his rival.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the first performance Mile. Laguerre, to whom Piccini\r\nhad trusted the rôle of Iphigenia, could not stand straight from\r\nintoxication. \"This is not 'Iphigenia in Tauris,'\" said the witty Sophie\r\nArnould, \"but 'Iphigenia in champagne.'\" She compensated afterward\r\nthough by singing the part with exquisite effect.\r\n\r\nWhile the Gluck-Piccini battle was at its height, an amateur who was\r\ndisgusted with the contest returned to the country and sang the praises\r\nof the birds and their gratuitous performances in the following epigram:\r\n\r\n     \"La n'est point d'art, d'ennui scientifique;\r\n     Piccini, Gluck, n'ont point noté les airs.\r\n     Nature seule en dicta la musique,\r\n     Et Marmontel n'en a pas fait les vers.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of this was probably applauded by the many who were\r\nwearied of the bitter recriminations, which degraded the art which they\r\nprofessed to serve.\r\n\r\nDuring the period when Gluck and Piccini were composing for the French\r\nopera, its affairs flourished liberally under the sway of De Vismes.\r\nGluck, Piccini, and Rameau wrote serious operas, while Piccini,\r\nSacchini, Anfossi, and Paisiello composed comic operas. The ballet\r\nflourished with unsurpassed splendor, and on the whole it may be said\r\nthat never has the opera presented more magnificence at Paris than\r\nduring the time France was on the eve of the Reign of Terror. The\r\ngay capital was thronged with great singers, the traditions of whose\r\nartistic ability compare favorably with those of a more recent period.\r\n\r\nThe witty and beautiful Sophie Arnould, who had a train of princes at\r\nher feet, was the principal exponent of Gluck's heroines, while Mile.\r\nLa-guerre was the mainstay of the Piccinists. The rival factions made\r\nthe names of these charming and capricious women their war-cries not\r\nless than those of the composers. The public bowed and cringed before\r\nthese idols of the stage. Gaétan Vestris, the first of the family, known\r\nas the \"Dieu de la Danse,\" and who held that there were only three great\r\nmen in Europe, Frederick the Great of Prussia, Voltaire, and himself,\r\ndared to dictate even to Gluck. \"Write me the music of a chaconne,\r\nMonsieur Gluek,\" said the god of dancing.\r\n\r\n\"A chaconne!\" said the enraged composer. \"Do you think the Greeks, whose\r\nmanners we are endeavoring to depict, knew what a chaconne was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they not?\" replied Vestris, astonished at this news, and in a tone\r\nof compassion continued, \"then they are much to be pitied.\"\r\n\r\nVestris did not obtain his ballet music from the obdurate German; but,\r\nwhen Piccini's rival \"Iphigènie en Tauride\" was produced, such beautiful\r\ndance measures were furnished by the Italian composer as gave Vestris\r\nthe opportunity for one of his greatest triumphs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe contest between Gluck and Piccini, or rather the cabals who adopted\r\nthe two musicians as their figure-heads, was brought to an end by the\r\ndeath of the former. An attempt was made to set up Sacchini in his\r\nplace, but it proved unavailing, as the new composer proved to be quite\r\nas much a follower of the prevailing Italian method as of the new school\r\nof Gluck. The French revolution swept away Piccini's property, and he\r\nretired to Italy. Bad fortune pursued him, however. Queen Caroline of\r\nNaples conceived a dislike to him and used her influence to injure his\r\ncareer, out of a fit of wounded vanity.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not think I remember my sister, Marie Antoinette?\" queried the\r\nsomewhat ill-favored queen. Piccini, embarrassed but truthful, replied:\r\n\"Your majesty, there maybe a family likeness, but no resemblance.\" A\r\nfatality attended him even to Venice. In 1792 he was mobbed and his\r\nhouse burned, because the populace regarded him as a republican, for\r\nhe had a French son-in-law. Some partial musical successes, however,\r\nconsoled him, though they flattered his _amour propre_ more than they\r\nbenefited his purse. On his return to Naples he was subjected to a\r\nspecies of imprisonment during four years, for royal displeasure in\r\nthose days did not confine itself merely to lack of court favor. Reduced\r\nto great poverty, the composer who had been the favorite of the rich and\r\ngreat for so many years knew often the actual pangs of hunger, and eked\r\nout his subsistence by writing conventual psalms, as payment for the\r\nbroken food doled out by the monks.\r\n\r\nAt last he was released, and the tenor, David, sent him funds to pay his\r\njourney to Paris. Napoleon, the first consul, received him cordially in\r\nthe Luxembourg palace.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" said he to Piccini, who remained standing, \"a man of your\r\ngreatness stands in no one's presence.\" His reception in Paris was,\r\nin fact, an ovation. The manager of the opera gave him a pension of\r\ntwenty-four hundred francs, a government pension was also accorded, and\r\nhe was appointed sixth inspector at the Conservatory. But the benefits\r\nof this pale gleam of wintry sunshine did not long remain. He died at\r\nPassy in the year 1800, and was followed to the grave by a great throng\r\nof those who loved his beautiful music and admired his gentle life.\r\n\r\nIn the present day Gluck appears to have vanquished Piccini, because\r\noccasionally an opera of the former is performed, while Piccini's works\r\nare only known to the musical antiquarian. But even the marble temples\r\nof Gluck are moss-grown and neglected, and that great man is known to\r\nthe present day rather as one whose influence profoundly colored and\r\nchanged the philosophy of opera, than through any immediate acquaintance\r\nwith his productions. The connoisseurs of the eighteenth century found\r\nPiccini's melodies charming, but the works that endure as masterpieces\r\nare not those which contain the greatest number of beauties, but those\r\nof which the form is the most perfect. Gluck had larger conceptions\r\nand more powerful genius than his Italian rival, but the latter's\r\nsweet spring of melody gave him the highest place which had so far been\r\nattained in the Italian operatic school.\r\n\r\n\"Piccini,\" says M. Genguèné, his biographer, \"was under the middle size,\r\nbut well made, with considerable dignity of carriage. His countenance\r\nwas very agreeable. His mind was acute, enlarged, and cultivated. Latin\r\nand Italian literature was familiar to him when he went to France, and\r\nafterward he became almost as well acquainted with French literature. He\r\nspoke and wrote Italian with great purity, but among his countrymen\r\nhe preferred the Neapolitan dialect, which he considered the most\r\nexpressive, the most difficult and the most figurative of all languages.\r\nHe used it principally in narration, with a gayety, a truth, and a\r\npantomimic expression after the manner of his country, which delighted\r\nall his friends, and made his stories intelligible even to those who\r\nknew Italian but slightly.\"\r\n\r\nAs a musician Piccini was noticeable, according to the judgment of his\r\nbest critics, for the purity and simplicity of his style. He always\r\nwished to preserve the supremacy of the voice, and, though he well knew\r\nhow to make his instrumentation rich and effective, he was a resolute\r\nopponent to the florid and complex accompaniments which were coming into\r\nvogue in his day. His recorded opinion on this subject may have some\r\ninterest for the musicians of the present day: \"Were the employment\r\nwhich Nature herself assigns to the instruments of an orchestra\r\npreserved to them, a variety of effects and a series of infinitely\r\ndiversified pictures would be produced. But they are all thrown in at\r\nonce and used incessantly, and they thus overpower and indurate the\r\near, without presenting any picture to the mind, to which the ear is\r\nthe passage. I should be glad to know how they will arouse it when it\r\nis accustomed to this uproar, which will soon happen, and of what new\r\nwitchcraft they will avail themselves.... It is well known what occurs\r\nto palates blunted by the use of spirituous liquors. In a few\r\nmonths everything may be learned which is necessary to produce these\r\nexaggerated effects, but it requires much time and study to be able to\r\nexcite genuine emotion.\" Piccini followed strictly the canons of the\r\nItalian school; and, though far inferior in really great qualities to\r\nhis rival Gluck, his compositions had in them so much of fluent grace\r\nand beauty as to place him at the head of his predecessors. Some curious\r\ncritics have indeed gone so far as to charge that many of the finest\r\narias of Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini owe their paternity to this\r\ncomposer, an indictment not uncommon in music, for most of the great\r\ncomposers have rifled the sweets of their predecessors without scruple.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nPaisiello and Cimarosa, in their style and processes of work, seem to\r\nhave more nearly caught the mantle of Piccini than any others, though\r\nthey were contemporaries as well as successors. Giovanni Paisiello,\r\nborn in 1741, was educated, like many other great musicians, at the\r\nconservatory of San Onofrio. During his early life he produced a great\r\nnumber of pieces for the Italian theatres, and in 1776 accepted the\r\ninvitation of Catherine to became the court composer at St. Petersburgh,\r\nwhere he remained nine years and produced several of his best operas,\r\nchief among them, \"Il Barbiere di Seviglia\" (a different version of\r\nBeaumarchais's celebrated comedy from that afterward used by Rossini).\r\n\r\nThe empress was devotedly attached to him and showed her esteem in many\r\nsignal ways. On one occasion, while Paisiello was accompanying her in\r\na song, she observed that he shuddered with the bitter cold. On this\r\nCatherine took off her splendid ermine cloak, decorated with clasps of\r\nbrilliants, and threw it over her tutor's shoulders. In a quarrel which\r\nPaisiello had with Marshal Beloseloky, the temporary favorite of the\r\nRussian Messalina, her favor was shown in a still more striking way. The\r\nmarshal had given the musician a blow, on which Paisiello, a very large,\r\nathletic man, drubbed the Russian general most unmercifully. The latter\r\ndemanded the immediate dismissal of the composer for having insulted a\r\ndignitary of the empire. Catherine's reply was similar to the one made\r\nby Francis the First of France in a parallel case about Leonardo da\r\nVinci: \"I neither can nor will attend to your request;' you forgot your\r\ndignity when you gave an unoffending man and a great artist a blow. Are\r\nyou surprised that he should have forgotten it too? As for rank, it is\r\nin my power to make fifty marshals, but not one Paisiello.\"\r\n\r\nSome years after his return to Italy, he was engaged by Napoleon as\r\nchapel-master; for that despot ruled the art and literature of his times\r\nas autocratically as their politics. Though Paisiello did not wish to\r\nobey the mandate, to refuse was ruin. The French ruler had already\r\nshown his favor by giving him the preference over Cherubim in several\r\nimportant musical contests, for the latter had always displayed stern\r\nindependence of courtly favor. On Paisiello's arrival in Paris, several\r\nlucrative appointments indicated the sincerity of Napoleon's intentions.\r\nThe composer did not hesitate to stand on his rights as a musician\r\non all occasions. When Napoleon complained of the inefficiency of the\r\nchapel service, he said, courageously: \"I can't blame people for doing\r\ntheir duty carelessly, when they are not justly paid.\" The cunning\r\nItalian knew how to flatter, though, when occasion served. He once\r\naddressed his master as \"Sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Sire,' what do you mean?\" answered the first consul. \"I am a general\r\nand nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, General,\" continued the composer, \"I have come to place myself at\r\nyour majesty's orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must really beg you,\" rejoined Napoleon, \"not to address me in this\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, General,\" said Paisiello. \"But I cannot give up the habit\r\nI have contracted in addressing sovereigns, who, compared with you, are\r\nbut pigmies. However, I will not forget your commands, and, if I have\r\nbeen unfortunate enough to offend, I must throw myself on your majesty's\r\nindulgence.\"\r\n\r\nPaisiello received ten thousand francs for the mass written for\r\nNapoleon's coronation, and one thousand for all others. As he produced\r\nmasses with great rapidity, he could very well afford to neglect\r\noperatic writing during this period. His masses were pasticcio work made\r\nup of pieces selected from his operas and other compositions. This could\r\nbe easily done, for music is arbitrary in its associations. Love songs\r\nof a passionate and sentimental cast were quickly made religious by\r\nsuitable words. Thus the same melody will depict equally well the rage\r\nof a baffled conspirator, the jealousy of an injured husband, the grief\r\nof lovers about to part, the despondency of a man bent on suicide, the\r\ndevotion of the nun, or the rapt adoration of worship. A different text\r\nand a slight change in time effect the marvel, and hardly a composer\r\nhas disdained to borrow from one work to enrich another. His only opera\r\ncomposed in Paris, \"Proserpine,\" was not successful.\r\n\r\nFailure of health obliged Paisiello to return to Naples, when he\r\nagain entered the service of the king. Attached to the fortunes of the\r\nBonaparte family, his prosperity fell with theirs. He had been crowned\r\nwith honors by all the musical societies of the world, but his pensions\r\nand emoluments ceased with the fall of Joachim Murat from the Neapolitan\r\nthrone. He died June 5,1816, and the court, which neglected him living,\r\ngave him a magnificent funeral.\r\n\r\n\"Paisiello,\" says the Chevalier Le Sueur, \"was not only a great\r\nmusician, but possessed a large fund of general information. He was\r\nwell versed in the dead languages, acquainted with all branches of\r\nliterature, and on terms of friendship with the most distinguished\r\npersons of the age. His mind was noble and above all mean passions; he\r\nneither knew envy nor the feeling of rivalry.... He composed,\" says the\r\nsame writer, \"seventy-eight operas, of which twenty-seven were serious,\r\nand fifty-one comic, eight _intermezzi_, and an immense number of\r\ncantatas, oratorios, masses, etc.; seven symphonies for King Joseph of\r\nSpain, and many miscellaneous pieces for the court of Russia.\"\r\n\r\nPaisiello's style, according to Fétis, was characterized by great\r\nsimplicity and apparent facility. His few and unadorned notes, full of\r\ngrace, were yet deep and varied in their expression. In his simplicity\r\nwas the proof of his abundance. It was not necessary for him to have\r\nrecourse to musical artifice and complication to conceal poverty of\r\ninvention. His accompaniments were similar in character, clear and\r\npicturesque, without pretense of elaboration. The latter not only\r\nrelieved and sustained the voice, but were full of original effects,\r\nnovel to his time. He was the author, too, of important improvements in\r\ninstrumental composition. He introduced the viola, clarinet, and bassoon\r\ninto the orchestra of the Italian opera. Though, voluminous both in\r\nserious and comic opera, it was in the latter that he won his chief\r\nlaurels. His \"Pazza per Amore\" was one of the great Pasta's favorites,\r\nand Catalani added largely to her reputation in the part of _La\r\nFrascatana_. Several of Paisiello's comic operas still keep a dramatic\r\nplace on the German stage, where excellence is not sacrificed to\r\nnovelty.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nA still higher place must be assigned to another disciple and follower\r\nof the school perfected by Piccini, Dominic Cimarosa, born in Naples\r\nin 1754. His life down to his latter years was an uninterrupted flow of\r\nprosperity. His mother, an humble washerwomen, could do little for her\r\nfatherless child, but an observant priest saw the promise of the lad,\r\nand taught him till he was old enough to enter the Conservatory of\r\nSt. Maria di Loretto. His early works showed brilliant invention and\r\nimagination, and the young Cimarosa, before he left the Conservatory,\r\nhad made himself a good violinist and singer. He worked hard, during a\r\nmusical apprenticeship of many years, to lay a solid foundation for\r\nthe fame which his teachers prophesied for him from the onset. Like\r\nPaisiello, he was for several years attached to the court of Catherine\r\nII. of Russia. He had already produced a number of pleasing works,\r\nboth serious and comic, for the Italian theatres, and his faculty of\r\nproduction was equaled by the richness and variety of his scores.\r\nDuring a period of four years spent at the imperial court of the North,\r\nCimarosa produced nearly five hundred works, great and small, and\r\nonly left the service of his magnificent patroness, who was no less\r\npassionately fond of art than she was great as a ruler and dissolute as\r\na woman, because the severe climate affected his health, for he was a\r\ntypical Italian in his temperament.\r\n\r\nHe was arrested in his southward journey by the urgent persuasions of\r\nthe Emperor Leopold, who made him chapel-master, with a salary of twelve\r\nthousand florins. The taste for the Italian school was still paramount\r\nat the musical capital of Austria. Though such composers as Haydn,\r\nSalieri, and young Mozart, who had commenced to be welcomed as an\r\nunexampled prodigy, were in Vienna, the court preferred the suave and\r\nshallow beauties of Italian music to their own serious German school,\r\nwhich was commencing to send down such deep roots into the popular\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nCimarosa produced \"Il Matrimonio Segreto\" (The Secret Marriage),\r\nhis finest opera, for his new patron. The libretto was founded on a\r\nforgotten French operetta, which again was adapted from Garrick and\r\nColman's \"Clandestine Marriage.\" The emperor could not attend the first\r\nrepresentation, but a brilliant audience hailed it with delight. Leopold\r\nmade amends, though, on the second night, for he stood in his box, and\r\nsaid, aloud:\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, Cimarosa, bravissimo! The whole opera is admirable, delightful,\r\nenchanting! I did not applaud, that I might not lose a single note of\r\nthis masterpiece. You have heard it twice, and I must have the same\r\npleasure before I go to bed. Singers and musicians pass into the next\r\nroom. Cimarosa will come, too, and preside at the banquet prepared for\r\nyou. When you have had sufficient rest, we will begin again. I\r\nencore the whole opera, and in the mean while let us applaud it as it\r\ndeserves.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor gave the signal, and, midst a thunderstorm of plaudits, the\r\nmusicians passed into their midnight feast. There is no record of any\r\nother such compliment, except that to the Latin dramatist, Plautus,\r\nwhose \"Eunuchus\" was performed twice on the same day.\r\n\r\nYet the same Viennese public, six years before, had actually hissed\r\nMozart's \"Nozze di Figaro,\" which shares with Rossini's \"Il Barbiere\"\r\nthe greatest rank in comic opera, and has retained, to this day, its\r\nperennial freshness and interest. Cimarosa himself did not share the\r\nopinion of his admirers in respect to Mozart. A certain Viennese painter\r\nattempted to flatter him, by decrying Mozart's music in comparison with\r\nhis own. The following retort shows the nobility of genius: \"I, sir?\r\nWhat would you call the man who would seek to assure you that you were\r\nsuperior to Raphael?\" Another acute rejoinder, on the respective merits\r\nof Mozart and Cimarosa, was made by the French composer, Grétry, in\r\nanswer to a criticism by Napoleon, when first consul, that great man\r\naffecting to be a _dilettante_ in music:\r\n\r\n\"Sire, Cimarosa puts the statue on the theatre and the pedestal in the\r\norchestra, instead of which Mozart puts the statue in the orchestra and\r\nthe pedestal on the theatre.\"\r\n\r\nThe composer's hitherto brilliant career was doomed to a gloomy close.\r\nOn returning to Naples, at the Emperor Leopold's death, Cimarosa\r\nproduced several of his finest works, among which musical students place\r\nfirst: \"Il Matrimonio per Susurro,\" \"La Penelope,\" \"L'Olimpiade,\" \"II\r\nSacrificio d'Abramo,\" \"Gli Amanti Comici,\" and \"Gli Orazi.\" These were\r\nperformed almost simultaneously in the theatres of Paris, Naples, and\r\nVienna. Cimarosa attached himself warmly to the French cause in Italy,\r\nand when the Bourbons finally triumphed the musician suffered their\r\nbitterest resentment. He narrowly escaped with his life, and languished\r\nfor a long time in a dungeon, so closely immured that it was for a long\r\ntime believed by his friends that his head had fallen on the block.\r\n\r\nAt length released, he quitted the Neapolitan territory, only to die at\r\nVenice, in a few months, \"in consequence,\" Stendhal says, in his \"Life\r\nof Rossini,\" \"of the barbarous treatment he had met with in the prison\r\ninto which he had been thrown by Queen Caroline.\" He died January 11,\r\n1801.\r\n\r\nCimarosa's genius embraced both the tragic and comic schools of\r\ncomposition. He may be specially called a genuine master of musical\r\ncomedy. He was the finest example of the school perfected by Piccini,\r\nand was indeed the link between the old Italian opera and the new\r\ndevelopment of which Rossini is such a brilliant exponent. Schluter, in\r\nhis \"History of Music,\" says of him: \"Like Mozart, he excels in\r\nthose parts of an opera which decide its merits as a work of art, the\r\n_ensembles_ and _finale_. His admirable, and by no means antiquated\r\nopera, 'Il Matrimonio Segreto' (the charming offspring of his 'secret\r\nmarriage' with the Mozart opera) is a model of exquisite and graceful\r\ncomedy. The overture bears a striking resemblance to that of 'Figaro,'\r\nand the instrumentation of the whole opera is highly characteristic,\r\nthough not so prominent as in Mozart. Especially delightful are the\r\nsecret love-scenes, written evidently _con amore_, the composer having\r\npractised them many a time in his youth.\"\r\n\r\nThis opera is still performed in many parts of Europe to delighted\r\naudiences, and is ranked by competent critics as the third finest\r\ncomic opera extant, Mozart and Rossini only surpassing him in their\r\nmasterpieces. It was a great favorite with Lablache, and its magnificent\r\nperformance by Grisi, Mario, Tamburini, and the king of bassos, is a\r\ngala reminiscence of English and French opera-goers.\r\n\r\nWe quote an opinion also from another able authority: \"The drama of 'Gli\r\nOrazi' is taken from Corneille's tragedy 'Les Horaces.' The music is\r\nfull of noble simplicity, beautiful melody, and strong expression. In\r\nthe airs dramatic truth is never sacrificed to vocal display, and the\r\nconcerted pieces are grand, broad, and effective. Taken as a whole, the\r\npiece is free from antiquated and obsolete forms; and it wants nothing\r\nbut an orchestral score of greater fullness and variety to satisfy\r\nthe modern ear. It is still frequently performed in Germany, though\r\nin France and England, and even in its native country, it seems to be\r\nforgotten.\"\r\n\r\nCardinal Consalvi, Cimarosa's friend, caused splendid funeral honors to\r\nbe paid to him at Rome. Canova executed a marble bust of him, which was\r\nplaced in the gallery of the Capitol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSSINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe \"Swan of Pesaro\" is a name linked with some of the most charming\r\nmusical associations of this age. Though forty years silence made\r\nfruitless what should have been the richest creative period of Rossini's\r\nlife, his great works, poured forth with such facility, and still\r\nretaining their grasp in spite of all changes in public opinion, stamp\r\nhim as being the most gifted composer ever produced by a country so\r\nfecund in musical geniuses. The old set forms of Italian opera had\r\nalready yielded in large degree to the energy and pomp of French\r\ndeclamation, when Rossini poured into them afresh such exhilaration and\r\nsparkle as again placed his country in the van of musical Europe.\r\nWith no pretension to the grand, majestic, and severe, his fresh and\r\ndelightful melodies, flowing without stint, excited alike the critical\r\nand the unlearned into a species of artistic craze, a mania which has\r\nnot yet subsided. The stiff and stately Oublicheff confesses, with many\r\ncompunctions of conscience, that, when listening for the first time to\r\none of Rossini's operas, he forgot for the time being all that he had\r\never known, admired, played, or sung, for he was musically drunk, as if\r\nwith champagne. Learned Germans might shake their heads and talk about\r\nshallowness and contrapuntal rubbish, his _crescendo_ and _stretto_\r\npassages, his tameness and uniformity even in melody, his want of\r\nartistic finish; but, as Richard Wagner, his direct antipodes, frankly\r\nconfesses in his \"Oper und Drama,\" such objections were dispelled\r\nby Rossini's opera-airs as if they were mere delusions of the fancy.\r\nEssentially different from Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Haydn, or even\r\nWeber, with whom he has some affinities, he stands a unique figure in\r\nthe history of art, an original both as man and musician.\r\n\r\nGioacchino Rossini was the son of a town-trumpeter and an operatic\r\nsinger of inferior rank, born in Pesaro, Romagna, February 29, 1792. The\r\nchild attended the itinerant couple in their visits to fairs and musical\r\ngatherings, and was in danger, at the age of seven, of becoming\r\na thorough-paced little vagabond, when maternal alarm trusted his\r\neducation to the friendly hands of the music-master Prinetti. At this\r\ntender age even he had been introduced to the world of art, for he sang\r\nthe part of a child at the Bologna opera.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Mme. Georgi-Righetti, \"could be imagined more tender,\r\nmore touching, than the voice and action of this remarkable child.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Rossini, after a year or two, came under the notice of the\r\ncelebrated teacher Tesei, of Bologna, who gave him lessons in pianoforte\r\nplaying and the voice, and obtained him a good place as boy-soprano\r\nat one of the churches. He now attracted the attention of the Countess\r\nPerticari, who admired his voice, and she sent him to the Lyceum to\r\nlearn fugue and counterpoint at the feet of a very strict Gamaliel,\r\nPadre Mallei. The youth was no dull student, and, in spite of his\r\ncapricious indolence, which vexed the soul of his tutor, he made such\r\nrapid progress that at the age of sixteen he was chosen to write the\r\ncantata, annually awarded to the most promising student. Success greeted\r\nthe juvenile effort, and thus we see Rossini fairly launched as a\r\ncomposer. Of the early operas which he poured out for five years it is\r\nnot needful to speak, except that one of them so pleased the austere\r\nMarshal Massena that he exempted the composer from conscription.\r\nThe first opera which made Rossini's name famous through Europe was\r\n\"Tancredi,\" written for the Venetian public. To this opera belongs the\r\ncharming \"Di tanti palpiti,\" written under the following circumstances:\r\nMme. Melanotte, the _prima donna_, took the whim during the final\r\nrehearsal that she would not sing the opening air, but must have\r\nanother. Rossini went home in sore disgust, for the whole opera was\r\nlikely to be put off by this caprice. There were but two hours before\r\nthe performance, he sat waiting for his macaroni, when an exquisite air\r\ncame into his head, and it was written in five minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter his great success he received offers from almost every town in\r\nItaly, each clamoring to be served first. Every manager was required\r\nto furnish his theatre with an opera from the pen of the new idol. For\r\nthese earlier essays he received a thousand francs each, and he wrote\r\nfive or six a year. Stendhall, Rossini's spirited biographer, gives\r\na picturesque account of life in the Italian theatres at this time, a\r\nstatus which remains in some of its features to-day:\r\n\r\n\"The mechanism is as follows: The manager is frequently one of the most\r\nwealthy and considerable persons of the little town he inhabits. He\r\nforms a company consisting of _prima donna, tenoro, basso cantante,\r\nbasso buffo_, a second female singer, and a third _basso_. The\r\n_libretto_, or poem, purchased for sixty or eighty francs from some\r\nlucky son of the muses, who is generally a half-starved abbé, the\r\nhanger-on of some rich family in the neighborhood. The character of the\r\nparasite, so admirably painted by Terence, is still to be found in all\r\nits glory in Lombardy, where the smallest town can boast of some five or\r\nsix families of some wealth.\r\n\r\n\"A _maestro_, or composer, is then engaged to write a new opera, and\r\nhe is obliged to adapt his own airs to the voices and capacity of the\r\ncompany. The manager intrusts the care of the financial department to\r\na _registrario_, who is generally some pettifogging attorney, who holds\r\nthe position of his steward. The next thing that generally happens is\r\nthat the manager falls in love with the _prima donna_; and the progress\r\nof this important amour gives ample employment to the curiosity of the\r\ngossips.\r\n\r\n\"The company thus organized at length gives its first representation,\r\nafter a month of cabals and intrigues, which furnish conversation for\r\nthe town. This is an event in the simple annals of the town, of the\r\nimportance of which the residents of large places can form no idea.\r\nDuring months together a population of eight or ten thousand people do\r\nnothing but discuss the merit of the forthcoming music and singers\r\nwith the eager impetuosity which belongs to the Italian character and\r\nclimate. The first representation, if successful, is generally followed\r\nby twenty or thirty more of the same piece, after which the company\r\nbreaks up.... From this little sketch of theatrical arrangements in\r\nItaly some idea may be formed of the life which Rossini led from 1810 to\r\n1816.\" Between these years he visited all the principal towns, remaining\r\nthree or four months at each, the idolized guest of the _dilettanti_\r\nof the place. Rossini's idleness and love of good cheer always made\r\nhim procrastinate his labors till the last moment, and placed him in\r\ndilemmas from which only his fluency of composition extricated him. His\r\nbiographer says:\r\n\r\n\"The day of performance is fast approaching, and yet he cannot resist\r\nthe pressing invitations of these friends to dine with them at the\r\ntavern. This, of course, leads to a supper, the champagne circulates\r\nfreely, and the hour of morning steals on apace. At length a\r\ncompunctious visiting shoots across the mind of the truant composer. He\r\nrises abruptly; his friends insist on seeing him home; and they parade\r\nthe silent streets bareheaded, shouting in chorus whatever comes\r\nuppermost, perhaps a portion of a _miserere_, to the great scandal of\r\npious Catholics tucked snugly in their beds. At length he reaches\r\nhis lodging, and shutting himself up in his chamber is, at this, to\r\nevery-day mortals, most ungenial hour, visited by some of his most\r\nbrilliant inspirations. These he hastily scratches down on scraps\r\nof paper, and next morning arranges them, or, in his own phrase,\r\ninstruments them, amid the renewed interruptions of his visitors. At\r\nlength the important night arrives. The _maestro_ takes his place at\r\nthe pianoforte. The theatre is overflowing, people having flocked to the\r\ntown from ten leagues distance. Every inn is crowded, and those unable\r\nto get other accommodations encamp around the theatre in their various\r\nvehicles. All business is suspended, and, during the performances, the\r\ntown has the appearance of a desert. The passions, the anxieties, the\r\nvery life of a whole population are centered in the theatre.\"\r\n\r\nRossini would preside at the first three representations, and, after\r\nreceiving a grand civic banquet, set out for the next place, his\r\nportmanteau fuller of music-paper than of other effects, and perhaps\r\na dozen sequins in his pocket. His love of jesting during these gay\r\nBohemian wanderings made him perpetrate innumerable practical jokes,\r\nnot sparing himself when he had no more available food for mirth. On one\r\noccasion, in traveling from Ancona to Reggio, he passed himself off for\r\na musical professor, a mortal enemy of Rossini, and sang the words of\r\nhis own operas to the most execrable music, in a cracked voice, to show\r\nhis superiority to that donkey, Rossini. An unknown admirer of his was\r\nin such a rage that he was on the point of chastising him for slandering\r\nthe great musician, about whom Italy raved.\r\n\r\nOur composer's earlier style was quite simple and unadorned, a fact\r\ndifficult for the present generation, only acquainted with the florid\r\nbeauties of his later works, to appreciate. Rossini only followed\r\nthe traditions of Italian music in giving singers full opportunity to\r\nembroider the naked score at their own pleasure. He was led to change\r\nthis practice by the following incident. The tenor-singer Velluti was\r\nthen the favorite of the Italian theatres, and indulged in the most\r\nunwarrantable tricks with his composers. During the first performance\r\nof \"L'Aureliano,\" at Naples, the singer loaded the music with such\r\nornaments that Rossini could not recognize the offspring of his own\r\nbrains. A fierce quarrel ensued between the two, and the composer\r\ndetermined thereafter to write music of such a character that the most\r\nstupid singer could not suppose any adornment needed. From that time the\r\nRossini music was marked by its florid and brilliant embroidery. Of the\r\nsame Velluti, spoken of above, an incident is told, illustrating the\r\nmusical craze of the country and the period. A Milanese gentleman,\r\nwhose father was very ill, met his friend in the street--\"Where are you\r\ngoing?\" \"To the Scala to be sure.\" \"How! your father lies at the point\r\nof death.\" \"Yes! yes! I know, but Velluti sings to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAn important step in Rossini's early career was his connection with the\r\nwidely known impresario of the San Carlo, Naples, Barbaja. He was under\r\ncontract to produce two new operas annually, to rearrange all old\r\nscores, and to conduct at all of the theatres ruled by this manager. He\r\nwas to receive two hundred ducats a month, and a share in the profits of\r\nthe bank of the San Carlo gambling-saloon. His first opera composed here\r\nwas \"Elisabetta, Regina d'Inghilterra,\" which was received with a\r\ngenuine Neapolitan _furore_. Rossini was feted and caressed by the\r\nardent _dilettanti_ of this city to his heart's content, and was such an\r\nidol of the \"fickle fair\" that his career on more than one occasion\r\nnarrowly escaped an untimely close, from the prejudice of jealous\r\nspouses. The composer was very vain of his handsome person, and boasted\r\nof his _escapades d'amour_. Many, too, will recall his _mot_, spoken to\r\na beauty standing between himself and the Duke of Wellington: \"Madame,\r\nhow happy should you be to find yourself placed between the two greatest\r\nmen in Europe!\"\r\n\r\nOne of Rossini's adventures at Naples has in it something of romance. He\r\nwas sitting in his chamber, humming one of his own operatic airs, when\r\nthe ugliest Mercury he had ever seen entered and gave him a note, then\r\ninstantly withdrew. This, of course, was a tender invitation, and an\r\nassignation at a romantic spot in the suburb. On arriving Rossini\r\nsang his _aria_ for a signal, and from the gate of a charming park\r\nsurrounding a small villa appeared his beautiful and unknown inamorata.\r\nOn parting it was agreed that the same messenger should bring notice of\r\nthe second appointment. Rossini suspected that the lady, in disguise,\r\nwas her own envoy, and verified the guess by following the light-footed\r\npage. He then discovered that she was the wife of a wealthy Sicilian,\r\nwidely noted for her beauty, and one of the reigning toasts. On renewing\r\nhis visit, he had barely arrived at the gate of the park, when a\r\ncarbine-bullet grazed his head, and two masked assailants sprang toward\r\nhim with drawn rapiers, a proceeding which left Rossini no option but to\r\ntake to his heels, as he was unarmed.\r\n\r\nDuring the composer's residence at Naples he was made acquainted with\r\nmany of the most powerful princes and nobles of Europe, and his name\r\nbecame a recognized factor in European music, though his works were\r\nnot widely known outside of his native land. His reputation for genius\r\nspread by report, for all who came in contact with the brilliant,\r\nhandsome Rossini were charmed. That which placed his European fame on\r\na solid basis was the production of \"Il Barbiere di Seviglia\" at Rome\r\nduring the carnival season of 1816.\r\n\r\nYears before Rossini had thought of setting the sparkling comedy of\r\nBeaumarchais to music, and Sterbini, the author of the _libretto_ used\r\nby Paisiello, had proposed to rearrange the story. Rossini, indeed, had\r\nbeen so complaisant as to write to the older composer for permission to\r\nset fresh music to the comedy; a concession not needed, for the plays\r\nof Metastasio had been used by different musicians without scruple.\r\nPaisiello intrigued against the new opera, and organized a conspiracy to\r\nkill it on the first night. Sterbini made the libretto totally different\r\nfrom the other, and Rossini finished the music in thirteen days, during\r\nwhich he never left the house. \"Not even did I get shaved,\" he said to a\r\nfriend. \"It seems strange that through the 'Barber' you should have gone\r\nwithout shaving.\" \"If I had shaved,\" Rossini explained, \"I should have\r\ngone out; and, if I had gone out, I should not have come back in time.\"\r\n\r\nThe first performance was a curious scene. The Argentina Theatre was\r\npacked with friends and foes. One of the greatest of tenors, Garcia, the\r\nfather of Malibran and Pauline Viardot, sang Almaviva. Rossini had been\r\nweak enough to allow Garcia to sing a Spanish melody for a serenade, for\r\nthe latter urged the necessity of vivid national and local color. The\r\ntenor had forgotten to tune his guitar, and in the operation on the\r\nstage a string broke. This gave the signal for a tumult of ironical\r\nlaughter and hisses. The same hostile atmosphere continued during the\r\nevening. Even Madame Georgi-Righetti, a great favorite of the Romans,\r\nwas coldly received by the audience. In short, the opera seemed likely\r\nto be damned.\r\n\r\nWhen the singers went to condole with Rossini, they found him enjoying a\r\nluxurious supper with the gusto of the _gourmet_ that he was. Settled\r\nin his knowledge that he had written a masterpiece, he could not be\r\ndisturbed by unjust clamor. The next night the fickle Romans made ample\r\namends, for the opera was concluded amid the warmest applause, even from\r\nthe friends of Paisiello.\r\n\r\nRossini's \"Il Barbiere,\" within six months, was performed on nearly\r\nevery stage in Europe, and received universally with great admiration.\r\nIt was only in Paris, two years afterward, that there was some coldness\r\nin its reception. Every one said that after Paisiello's music on the\r\nsame subject it was nothing, when it was suggested that Paisiello's\r\nshould be revived. So the St. Petersburg \"Barbiere\" of 1788 was\r\nproduced, and beside Rossini's it proved so dull, stupid, and antiquated\r\nthat the public instantly recognized the beauties of the work which they\r\nhad persuaded themselves to ignore. Yet for this work, which placed the\r\nreputation of the young composer on a lofty pedestal, he received only\r\ntwo thousand francs.\r\n\r\nOur composer took his failures with great phlegm and good nature, based,\r\nperhaps, on an invincible self-confidence. When his \"Sigismonde\" had\r\nbeen hissed at Venice, he sent his mother a _fiasco_ (bottle). In\r\nthe last instance he sent her, on the morning succeeding the first\r\nperformance, a letter with a picture of a _fiaschetto_ (little bottle).\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe same year (1816) was produced at Naples the opera of \"Otello,\" which\r\nwas an important point of departure in the reforms introduced by Rossini\r\non the Italian stage. Before speaking further of this composer's career,\r\nit is necessary to admit that every valuable change furthered by him had\r\nalready been inaugurated by Mozart, a musical genius so great that he\r\nseems to have included all that went before, all that succeeded him. It\r\nwas not merely that Rossini enriched the orchestration to such a degree,\r\nbut, revolting from the delay of the dramatic movement, caused by\r\nthe great number of arias written for each character, he gave large\r\nprominence to the concerted pieces, and used them where monologue had\r\nformerly been the rule. He developed the basso and baritone parts,\r\ngiving them marked importance in serious opera, and worked out the\r\nchoruses and finales with the most elaborate finish.\r\n\r\nLord Mount Edgcumbe, a celebrated connoisseur and admirer of the old\r\nschool, wrote of these innovations, ignoring the fact that Mozart had\r\ngiven the weight of his great authority to them before the daring young\r\nItalian composer:\r\n\r\n\"The construction of these newly-invented pieces is essentially\r\ndifferent from the old. The dialogue, which used to be carried on in\r\nrecitative, and which, in Metastasio's operas, is often so beautiful\r\nand interesting, and now cut up (and rendered unintelligible if it\r\nwere worth listening to) into _pezzi concertati_, or long singing\r\nconversations, which present a tedious succession of unconnected,\r\never-changing motives, having nothing to do with each other; and if a\r\nsatisfactory air is for a moment introduced, which the ear would like\r\nto dwell upon, to hear modulated, varied, and again returned to, it is\r\nbroken off, before it is well understood, by a sudden transition in an\r\nentirely different melody, time, and key, and recurs no more, so that\r\nno impression can be made, or recollection of it preserved. Single songs\r\nare almost exploded.... Even the _prima donna_, who formerly would have\r\ncomplained at having less than three or four airs allotted to her, is\r\nnow satisfied with having one single _cavatina_ given to her during the\r\nwhole opera.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Otello,\" Rossini introduced his operatic changes to the Italian\r\npublic, and they were well received; yet great opposition was manifested\r\nby those who clung to the time-honored canons. Sigismondi, of the Naples\r\nConservatory, was horror-stricken on first seeing the score of this\r\nopera. The clarionets were too much for him, but on seeing third and\r\nfourth horn-parts, he exclaimed: \"What does the man want? The greatest\r\nof our composers have always been contented with two. Shades of\r\nPergolesi, of Leo, of Jomelli! How they must shudder at the bare\r\nthought! Four horns! Are we at a hunting-party? Four horns! Enough to\r\nblow us to perdition!\" Donizetti, who was Sigismondi's pupil, also tells\r\nan amusing incident of his preceptor's disgust. He was turning over a\r\nscore of \"Semiramide\" in the library, when the _maestro_ came in and\r\nasked him what music it was. \"Rossini's,\" was the answer. Sigismondi\r\nglanced at the page and saw 1. 2. 3. trumpets, being the first, second,\r\nand third trumpet parts. Aghast, he shouted, stuffing his fingers in\r\nhis ears, \"One hundred and twenty-three trumpets! _Corpo di Cristo!_\r\nthe world's gone mad, and I shall go mad too!\" And so he rushed from the\r\nroom, muttering to himself about the hundred and twenty-three trumpets.\r\n\r\nThe Italian public, in spite of such criticism, very soon accepted the\r\nopera of \"Otello\" as the greatest serious opera ever written for their\r\nstage. It owed much, however, to the singers who illustrated its rôles.\r\nMme. Colbran, afterward Rossini's wife, sang Desdemona, and Davide,\r\nOtello. The latter was the predecessor of Rubini as the finest singer of\r\nthe Rossinian music. He had the prodigious compass of three octaves;\r\nand M. Bertin, a French critic, says of this singer, so honorably linked\r\nwith the career of our composer: \"He is full of warmth, _verve_, energy,\r\nexpression, and musical sentiment; alone he can fill up and give life to\r\na scene; it is impossible for another singer to carry away an audience\r\nas he does, and, when he will only be simple, he is admirable. He is the\r\nRossini of song; he is the greatest singer I ever heard.\" Lord Byron,\r\nin one of his letters to Moore, speaks of the first production at Milan,\r\nand praises the music enthusiastically, while condemning the libretto as\r\na degradation of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n\"La Cenerentola\" and \"La Gazza Ladra\" were written in quick succession\r\nfor Naples and Milan. The former of these works, based on the old\r\nCinderella myth, was the last opera written by Rossini to illustrate the\r\nbeauties of the contralto voice, and Madame Georgi-Righetti, the early\r\nfriend and steadfast patroness of the musician during his early days of\r\nstruggle, made her last great appearance in it before retiring from the\r\nstage. In this composition, Rossini, though one of the most affluent\r\nand rapid of composers, displays that economy in art which sometimes\r\ncharacterized him. He introduced in it many of the more beautiful airs\r\nfrom his earlier and less successful works. He believed on principle\r\nthat it was folly to let a good piece of music be lost through being\r\nmarried to a weak and faulty libretto. The brilliant opera of \"La\r\nGazza Ladra,\" set to the story of a French melodrama, \"La Pie Voleuse,\"\r\naggravated the quarrel between Paer, the director of the French opera,\r\nand the gifted Italian. Paer had designed to have written the music\r\nhimself, but his librettist slyly turned over the poem to Rossini, who\r\nproduced one of his masterpieces in setting it. The audience at La Scala\r\nreceived the work with the noisiest demonstrations, interrupting the\r\nprogress of the drama with constant cries of \"_Bravo! Maestro!\" \"Viva\r\nRossini!\"_ The composer afterward said that acknowledging the calls of\r\nthe audience fatigued him much more than the direction of the opera.\r\nWhen the same work was produced four years after in London, under Mr.\r\nEbers's management, an incident related by that _impresario_ in his\r\n\"Seven Years of the King's Theatre\" shows how eagerly it was received by\r\nan English audience.\r\n\r\n\"When I entered the stage door, I met an intimate friend, with a long\r\nface and uplifted eyes. 'Good God! Ebers, I pity you from my soul. This\r\nungrateful public,' he continued. 'The wretches! Why! my dear sir, they\r\nhave not left you a seat in your own house.' Relieved from the fears he\r\nhad created, I joined him in his laughter, and proceeded, assuring him\r\nthat I felt no ill toward the public for their conduct toward me.\"\r\n\r\nPassing over \"Armida,\" written for the opening of the new San Carlo\r\nat Naples, \"Adelaida di Borgogna,\" for the Roman Carnival of 1817,\r\nand \"Adina,\" for a Lisbon theatre, we come to a work which is one of\r\nRossini's most solid claims on musical immortality, \"Mosé in Egitto,\"\r\nfirst produced at the San Carlo, Naples, in 1818. In \"Mosé,\" Rossini\r\ncarried out still further than ever his innovations, the two principal\r\nrôles--_Mosé, and Faraoni_--being assigned to basses. On the first\r\nrepresentation, the crossing of the Red Sea moved the audience to\r\nsatirical laughter, which disconcerted the otherwise favorable reception\r\nof the piece, and entirely spoiled the final effects. The manager was at\r\nhis Avit's end, till Tottola, the librettist, suggested a prayer for the\r\nIsraelites before and after the passage of the host through the cleft\r\nwaters. Rossini instantly seized the idea, and, springing from bed in\r\nhis night-shirt, wrote the music with almost inconceivable rapidity,\r\nbefore his embarrassed visitors recovered from their surprise. The same\r\nevening the magnificent _Dal tuo stellato soglio_ (\"To thee, Great\r\nLord\") was performed with the opera.\r\n\r\nLet Stendhall, Rossini's biographer, tell the rest of the story: \"The\r\naudience was delighted as usual with the first act, and all went well\r\ntill the third, when, the passage of the Red Sea being at hand, the\r\naudience as usual prepared to be amused. The laughter was just beginning\r\nin the pit, when it was observed that Moses was about to sing. He began\r\nhis solo, the first verse of a prayer, which all the people repeat in\r\nchorus after Moses. Surprised at this novelty, the pit listened and\r\nthe laughter entirely ceased. The chorus, exceedingly fine, was in the\r\nminor. Aaron continues, followed by the people. Finally, Eleia addresses\r\nto Heaven the same supplication, and the people respond. Then all fall\r\non their knees and repeat the prayer with enthusiasm; the miracle is\r\nperformed, the sea is opened to leave a path for the people protected\r\nby the Lord. This last part is in the major. It is impossible to imagine\r\nthe thunders of applause that resounded through the house: one would\r\nhave thought it was coming down. The spectators in the boxes, standing\r\nup and leaning over, called out at the top of their voices, '_Bello,\r\nbello! O che hello!_', I never saw so much enthusiasm nor such a\r\ncomplete success, which was so much the greater, inasmuch as the people\r\nwere quite prepared to laugh.... I am almost in tears when I think of\r\nthis prayer. This state of things lasted a long time, and one of its\r\neffects was to make for its composer the reputation of an assassin,\r\nfor Dr. Cottogna is said to have remarked: 'I can cite to you more than\r\nforty attacks of nervous fever or violent convulsions on the part of\r\nyoung women, fond to excess of music, which have no other origin than\r\nthe prayer of the Hebrews in the third act, with its superb change of\r\nkey.'\" Thus by a stroke of genius, a scene which first impressed the\r\naudience as a piece of theatrical burlesque, was raised to sublimity by\r\nthe solemn music written for it.\r\n\r\nM. Bochsa some years afterward produced \"Mosé\" as an oratorio in London,\r\nand it failed. A new libretto, however, \"Pietro L'Eremito,\"* again\r\ntransformed the music into an opera.\r\n\r\n     * The same music was set to a poem founded on the first\r\n     crusade, all the most effective situations being\r\n     dramatically utilized for the Christian legend.\r\n\r\nEbers tells us that Lord Sefton, a distinguished connoisseur, only\r\npronounced the general verdict in calling it the greatest of serious\r\noperas, for it was received with the greatest favor. A gentleman of high\r\nrank was not satisfied with assuring the manager that he had deserved\r\nwell of his country, but avowed his determination to propose him for\r\nmembership at the most exclusive of aristocratic clubs--White's.\r\n\r\n\"La Donna del Lago,\" Rossini's next great work, also first produced at\r\nthe San Carlo during the Carnival of 1820, though splendidly performed,\r\ndid not succeed well the first night. The composer left Naples the same\r\nnight for Milan, and coolly informed every one _en route_ that the\r\nopera was very successful, which proved to be true when he reached his\r\njourney's end, for the Neapolitans on the second night reversed their\r\ndecision into an enthusiasm as marked as their coldness had been.\r\n\r\nShortly after this Rossini married his favorite _prima donna_, Madame\r\nColbran. He had just completed two of his now forgotten operas, \"Bianca\r\ne Faliero,\" and \"Matilda di Shabran,\" but did not stay to watch their\r\npublic reception. He quietly took away the beautiful Colbran, and at\r\nBologne was married by the archbishop. Thence the freshly-wedded couple\r\nvisited Vienna, and Rossini there produced his \"Zelmira,\" his wife\r\nsinging the principal part. One of the most striking of this composer's\r\nworks in invention and ingenious development of ideas, Carpani says\r\nof it: \"It contains enough to furnish not one but four operas. In this\r\nwork, Rossini, by the new riches which he draws from his prodigious\r\nimagination, is no longer the author of 'Otello,' 'Tancredi,' 'Zoraide,'\r\nand all his preceding works; he is another composer, new, agreeable,\r\nand fertile, as much as at first, but with more command of himself, more\r\npure, more masterly, and, above all, more faithful to the interpretation\r\nof the words. The forms of style employed in this opera according\r\nto circumstances are so varied, that now we seem to hear Gluck, now\r\nTraetta, now Sacchini, now Mozart, now Handel; for the gravity, the\r\nlearning, the naturalness, the suavity of their conceptions, live and\r\nblossom again in 'Zelmira.' The transitions are learned, and inspired\r\nmore by considerations of poetry and sense than by caprice and a mania\r\nfor innovation. The vocal parts, always natural, never trivial, give\r\nexpression to the words without ceasing to be melodious. The great\r\npoint is to preserve both. The instrumentation of Rossini is really\r\nincomparable by the vivacity and freedom of the manner, by the variety\r\nand justness of the coloring.\" Yet it must be conceded that, while this\r\nopera made a deep impression on musicians and critics, it did not please\r\nthe general public. It proved languid and heavy with those who could not\r\nrelish the science of the music and the skill of the combinations. Such\r\ninstances as this are the best answer to that school of critics,\r\nwho have never ceased clamoring that Rossini could write nothing but\r\nbeautiful tunes to tickle the vulgar and uneducated mind.\r\n\r\n\"Semiramide,\" first performed at the Fenice theatre in Venice on\r\nFebruary 3, 1823, was the last of Rossini's Italian operas, though it\r\nhad the advantage of careful rehearsals and a noble caste. It was not\r\nwell received at first, though the verdict of time places it high among\r\nthe musical masterpieces of the century. In it were combined all of\r\nRossini's, ideas of operatic reform, and the novelty of some of the\r\ninnovations probablv accounts for the inability of his earlier public to\r\nappreciate its merits. Mme. Rossini made her last public appearance in\r\nthis great work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nHenceforward the career of the greatest of the Italian composers, the\r\ngenius who shares with Mozart the honor of having impressed himself more\r\nthan any other on the style and methods of his successors, was to\r\nbe associated with French music, though never departing from his\r\ncharacteristic quality as an original and creative mind. He modified\r\nFrench music, and left great disciples on whom his influence was\r\nradical, though perhaps we may detect certain reflex influences in his\r\nlast and greatest opera, \"William Tell.\" But of this more hereafter.\r\n\r\nBefore finally settling in the French capital, Rossini visited London,\r\nwhere he was received with great honors. \"When Rossini entered,\"* says\r\na writer in a London paper of that date, \"he was received with loud\r\nplaudits, all the persons in the pit standing on the seats to get a\r\nbetter view of him.\r\n\r\n     * His first English appearance in public was at the King's\r\n     Theatre on the 24th of January, 1824, when he conducted his\r\n     own opera, \"Zelmira.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued for a minute or two to bow respectfully to the audience,\r\nand then gave the signal for the overture to begin. He appeared stout\r\nand somewhat below the middle height, with rather a heavy air, and a\r\ncountenance which, though intelligent, betrayed none of the vivacity\r\nwhich distinguishes his music; and it was remarked that he had more of\r\nthe appearance of a sturdy, beef-eating Englishman, than a fiery and\r\nsensitive native of the south.\"\r\n\r\nThe king, George IV., treated Rossini with peculiar consideration. On\r\nmore than one occasion he walked with him arm-in-arm through a crowded\r\nconcert-hall to the conductor's stand. Yet the composer, who seems\r\nnot to have admired his English Majesty, treated the monarch with much\r\nindependence, not to say brusqueness, on one occasion, as if to signify\r\nhis disdain of even royal patronage. At a grand concert at St. James's\r\nPalace, the king said, at the close of the programme, \"Now, Rossini,\r\nwe will have one piece more, and that shall be the _finale_.\" The other\r\nreplied, \"I think, sir, we have had music enough for one night,\" and\r\nmade his bow.\r\n\r\nHe was an honored guest at the most fashionable houses, where his\r\ntalents as a singer and player were displayed with much effect in an\r\nunconventional, social way. Auber, the French composer, was present on\r\none of these occasions, and indicates how great Rossini could have been\r\nin executive music had he not been a king in the higher sphere. \"I shall\r\nnever forget the effect,\" writes Auber, \"produced by his lightning-like\r\nexecution. When he had finished I looked mechanically at the ivory\r\nkeys. I fancied I could see them smoking.\" Rossini was richer by seven\r\nthousand pounds by this visit to the English metropolis. Though he had\r\nbeen under engagement to produce a new opera as well as to conduct those\r\nwhich had already made him famous, he failed to keep this part of his\r\ncontract. Passages in his letters at this time would seem to indicate\r\nthat Rossini was much piqued because the London public received his\r\nwife, to whom he was devotedly attached, with coldness. Notwithstanding\r\nthe beauty of her face and figure, and the greatness of her style both\r\nas actress and singer, she was pronounced _passée_ alike in person\r\nand voice, with a species of brutal frankness not uncommon in English\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nWhen Rossini arrived in Paris he was almost immediately appointed\r\ndirector of the Italian Opera by the Duc de Lauriston. With this and the\r\nAcadémie he remained connected till the revolution of 1830. \"Le Siège\r\nde Corinthe,\" adapted from his old work, \"Maometto II.,\" was the first\r\nopera presented to the Parisian public, and, though admired, did not\r\nbecome a favorite. The French _amour propre_ was a little stung when it\r\nwas made known that Rossini had simply modified and reshaped one of his\r\nearly and immature productions as his first attempt at composition in\r\nFrench opera. His other works for the French stage were \"Il Viaggio a\r\nRheims,\" \"Le Comte Ory,\" and \"Guillaume Tell.\"\r\n\r\nThe last-named opera, which will ever be Rossini's crown of glory as a\r\ncomposer, was written with his usual rapidity while visiting the château\r\nof M. Aguado, a country-seat some distance from Paris. This work, one of\r\nthe half-dozen greatest ever written, was first produced at the Académie\r\nRoyale on August 3, 1829. In its early form of libretto it had a run of\r\nfifty-six representations, and was then withdrawn from the stage; and\r\nthe work of remodeling from five to three acts, and other improvements\r\nin the dramatic framework, was thoroughly carried out. In its new form\r\nthe opera blazed into an unprecedented popularity, for of the greatness\r\nof the music there had never been but one judgment. Fétis, the eminent\r\ncritic, writing of it immediately on its production, said, \"The work\r\ndisplays a new man in an old one, and proves that it is in vain to\r\nmeasure the action of genius,\" and follows with, \"This production opens\r\na new career to Rossini,\" a prophecy unfortunately not to be realized,\r\nfor Rossini was soon to retire from the field in which he had made such\r\na remarkable career, while yet in the very prime of his powers.\r\n\r\n\"Guillaume Tell\" is full of melody, alike in the solos and the massive\r\nchoral and ballet music. It runs in rich streams through every part of\r\nthe composition. The overture is better known to the general public\r\nthan the opera itself, and is one of the great works of musical art.\r\nThe opening andante in triple time for the five violoncelli and double\r\nbasses at once carries the hearer to the regions of the upper Alps,\r\nwhere amid the eternal snows Nature sleeps in a peaceful dream. We\r\nperceive the coming of the sunlight, and the hazy atmosphere clearing\r\naway before the newborn day. In the next movement the solitude is\r\nall dispelled. The raindrops fall thick and heavy, and a thunderstorm\r\nbursts. But the fury is soon spent, and the clouds clear away. The\r\nshepherds are astir, and from the mountain-sides come the peculiar\r\nnotes of the \"Ranz des Vaches\" from their pipes. Suddenly all is changed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTrumpets call to arms, and with the mustering battalions the music\r\nmarks the quickstep, as the shepherd patriots march to meet the\r\nAustrian chivalry. A brilliant use of the violins and reeds depicts\r\nthe exultation of the victors on their return, and closes one of the\r\ngrandest sound-paintings in music.\r\n\r\nThe original cast of \"Guillaume Tell\" included the great singers then\r\nin Paris, and these were so delighted with the music, that the morning\r\nafter the first production they assembled on the terrace before his\r\nhouse and performed selections from it in his honor.\r\n\r\nWith this last great effort Rossini, at the age of thirty-seven, may\r\nbe said to have retired from the field of music, though his life was\r\nprolonged for forty years. True, he composed the \"Stabat Mater\" and the\r\n\"Messe Solennelle,\" but neither of these added to the reputation won\r\nin his previous career. The \"Stabat Mater,\" publicly performed for the\r\nfirst time in 1842, has been recognized, it is true, as a masterpiece;\r\nbut its entire lack of devotional solemnity, its brilliant and showy\r\ntexture, preclude its giving Rossini any rank as a religious composer.\r\n\r\nHe spent the forty years of his retirement partly at Bologna, partly at\r\nPassy, near Paris, the city of his adoption. His hospitality welcomed\r\nthe brilliant men from all parts of Europe who loved to visit him, and\r\nhis relations with other great musicians were of the most kindly and\r\ncordial character. His sunny and genial nature never knew envy, and\r\nhe was quick to recognize the merits of schools opposed to his own. He\r\ndied, after intense suffering, on November 13, 1868. He had been some\r\ntime ill, and four of the greatest physicians in Europe were his almost\r\nconstant attendants. The funeral of \"The Swan of Pesaro,\" as he was\r\ncalled by his compatriots, was attended by an immense concourse, and his\r\nremains rest in Père-Lachaise.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nMoscheles, the celebrated pianist, gives us some charming pictures of\r\nRossini in his home at Passy, in his diary of 1860. He writes: \"Felix\r\n[his son] had been made quite at home in the villa on former occasions.\r\nTo me the _parterre salon_, with its rich furniture, was quite new, and\r\nbefore the _maestro_ himself appeared we looked at his photograph in a\r\ncircular porcelain frame, on the sides of which were inscribed the names\r\nof his works. The ceiling is covered with pictures illustrating scenes\r\nout of Palestrina's and Mozart's lives; in the middle of the room stands\r\na Pleyel piano. When Rossini came in he gave me the orthodox Italian\r\nkiss, and was effusive of expressions of delight at my reappearance,\r\nand very complimentary on the subject of Felix. In the course of our\r\nconversation he was full of hard-hitting truths on the present study and\r\nmethod of vocalization. 'I don't want to hear anything more of it,' he\r\nsaid; 'they scream. All I want is a resonant, full-toned voice, not\r\na screeching voice. I care not whether it be for speaking or singing,\r\neverything ought to sound melodious.'\" So, too, Rossini assured\r\nMoscheles that he hated the new school of piano-players, saying the\r\npiano was horribly maltreated, for the performers thumped the keys as\r\nif they had some vengeance to wreak on them. When the great player\r\nimprovised for Rossini, the latter says: \"It is music that flows from\r\nthe fountain-head. There is reservoir water and spring water. The former\r\nonly runs when you turn the cock, and is always redolent of the vase;\r\nthe latter always gushes forth fresh and limpid. Nowadays people\r\nconfound the simple and the trivial; a _motif_ of Mozart they would call\r\ntrivial, if they dared.\"\r\n\r\nOn other occasions Moscheles plays to the _maestro_, who insists on\r\nhaving discovered barriers in the \"humoristic variations,\" so boldly do\r\nthey seem to raise the standard of musical revolution; his title of the\r\n\"Grand Valse\" he finds too unassuming. \"Surely a waltz with some angelic\r\ncreature must have inspired you, Moscheles, with this composition, and\r\n_that_ the title ought to express. Titles, in fact, should pique the\r\ncuriosity of the public.\" \"A view uncongenial to me,\" adds Moscheles;\r\n\"however, I did not discuss it.... A dinner at Rossini's is calculated\r\nfor the enjoyment of a 'gourmet,' and he himself proved to be the one,\r\nfor he went through the very select _menu_ as only a connoisseur would.\r\nAfter dinner he looked through my album of musical autographs with the\r\ngreatest interest, and finally we became very merry, I producing my\r\nmusical jokes on the piano, and Felix and Clara figuring in the duet\r\nwhich I had written for her voice and his imitation of the French\r\nhorn. Rossini cheered lustily, and so one joke followed another till we\r\nreceived the parting kiss and 'good night.'... At my next visit,\r\nRossini showed me a charming 'Lied oline Worte,' which he composed only\r\nyesterday; a graceful melody is embodied in the well-known technical\r\nform. Alluding to a performance of 'Semiramide,' he said with a\r\nmalicious smile, 'I suppose you saw the beautiful decorations in it?' He\r\nhas not received the Sisters Marchisio for fear they should sing to\r\nhim, nor has he heard them in the theatre; he spoke warmly of Pasta,\r\nLablache, Rubini, and others, then he added that I ought not to look\r\nwith jealousy upon his budding talent as a pianoforte-player, but that,\r\non the contrary, I should help to establish his reputation as such in\r\nLeipsic. He again questioned me with much interest about my intimacy\r\nwith Clementi, and, calling me that master's worthy successor, he said\r\nhe should like to visit me in Leipsic, if it were not for those dreadful\r\nrailways, which he would never travel by. All this in his bright and\r\nlively way; but when we came to discuss Chevet, who wishes to supplant\r\nmusical notes by ciphers, he maintained in an earnest and dogmatic\r\ntone that the system of notation, as it had developed itself since\r\nPope Gregory's time, was sufficient for all musical requirements. He\r\ncertainly could not withhold some appreciation for Chevet, but refused\r\nto indorse the certificate granted by the Institute in his favor; the\r\nsystem he thought impracticable.\r\n\r\n\"The never-failing stream of conversation flowed on until eleven\r\no'clock, when I was favored with the inevitable kiss, which on this\r\noccasion was accompanied by special farewell blessings.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after Moscheles had left Paris, his son forwarded to him most\r\nfriendly messages from Rossini, and continues thus: \"Rossini sends you\r\nword that he is working hard at the piano, and, when you next come\r\nto Paris, you shall find him in better practice.... The conversation\r\nturning upon German music, I asked him 'which was his favorite among the\r\ngreat masters?' Of Beethoven he said: 'I take him twice a week, Haydn\r\nfour times, and Mozart every day. You will tell me that Beethoven is a\r\nColossus who often gives you a dig in the ribs, while Mozart is always\r\nadorable; it is that the latter had the chance of going very young to\r\nItaly, at a time when they still sang well.' Of Weber he says, 'He has\r\ntalent enough, and to spare' (Il a du talent à revendre, celui-là). He\r\ntold me in reference to him, that, when the part of 'Tancred' was sung\r\nat Berlin by a bass voice, Weber had written violent articles not only\r\nagainst the management, but against the composer, so that, when Weber\r\ncame to Paris, he did not venture to call on Rossini, who, however, let\r\nhim know that he bore him no grudge for having made these attacks; on\r\nreceipt of that message Weber called and they became acquainted.\r\n\r\n\"I asked him if he had met Byron in Venice? 'Only in a restaurant,' was\r\nthe answer, 'where I was introduced to him; our acquaintance, therefore,\r\nwas very slight; it seems he has spoken of me, but I don't know what he\r\nsays.' I translated for him, in a somewhat milder form, Byron's words,\r\nwhich happened to be fresh in my memory: 'They have been crucifying\r\nOthello into an opera; the music good but lugubrious, but, as for the\r\nwords, all the real scenes with Iago cut out, and the greatest nonsense\r\ninstead, the handkerchief turned into a billet-doux, and the first\r\nsinger would not black his face--singing, dresses, and music very good.'\r\nThe _maestro_ regretted his ignorance of the English language, and said,\r\n'In my day I gave much time to the study of our Italian literature.\r\nDante is the man I owe most to; he taught me more music than all my\r\nmusic-masters put together, and when I wrote my 'Otello,' I would\r\nintroduce those lines of Dante--you know the song of the gondolier.\r\nMy librettist would have it that gondoliers never sang Dante, and but\r\nrarely Tasso, but I answered him, 'I know all about that better than\r\nyou, for I have lived in Venice and you haven't. Dante I must and will\r\nhave.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nAn ardent disciple of Wagner sums up his ideas of the mania for\r\nthe Rossini music, which possessed Europe for fifteen years, in the\r\nfollowing: \"Rossini, the most gifted and spoiled of her sons [speaking\r\nof Italy] sallied forth with an innumerable army of Bacchantic melodies\r\nto conquer the world, the Messiah of joy, the breaker of thought and\r\nsorrow. Europe, by this time, had tired of the empty pomp of French\r\ndeclamation. It lent but too willing an ear to the new gospel, and\r\neagerly quaffed the intoxicating potion, which Rossini poured out in\r\ninexhaustible streams.\" This very well expresses the delight of all the\r\ncountries of Europe in music which for a long time almost monopolized\r\nthe stage.\r\n\r\nThe charge of being a mere tune-spinner, the denial of invention, depth,\r\nand character, have been common watchwords in the mouths of critics\r\nwedded to other schools. But Rossini's place in music stands unshaken by\r\nall assaults. The vivacity of his style, the freshness of his melodies,\r\nthe richness of his combinations, made all the Italian music that\r\npreceded him pale and colorless. No other writer revels in such luxury\r\nof beauty, and delights the ear with such a succession of delicious\r\nsurprises in melody.\r\n\r\nHenry Chorley, in his \"Thirty Years' Musical Recollections,\" rebukes the\r\nbigotry which sees nothing good but in its own kind: \"I have never been\r\nable to understand why this [referring to the Rossinian richness of\r\nmelody] should be contemned as necessarily false and meretricious--why\r\nthe poet may not be allowed the benefit of his own period and time--why\r\na lover of architecture is to be compelled to swear by the _Dom_\r\nat Bamberg, or by the Cathedral at Monreale--that he must abhor and\r\ndenounce Michel Angelo's church or the Baths of Diocletian at Rome--why\r\nthe person who enjoys 'Il Barbiere' is to be denounced as frivolously\r\nfaithless to Mozart's 'Figaro'--and as incapable of comprehending\r\n'Fidelio,' because the last act of 'Otello' and the second of 'Guillaume\r\nTell' transport him into as great an enjoyment of its kind as do\r\nthe duet in the cemetery between 'Don Juan' and 'Leporello' and the\r\n'Prisoners' Chorus.' How much good, genial pleasure has not the world\r\nlost in music, owing to the pitting of styles one against the other!\r\nYour true traveler will be all the more alive to the beauty of Nuremberg\r\nbecause he has looked out over the 'Golden Shell' at Palermo; nor\r\ndelight in Rhine and Danube the less because he has seen the glow of a\r\nsouthern sunset over the broken bridge at Avignon.\"\r\n\r\nAs grand and true as are many of the essential elements in the Wagner\r\nschool of musical composition, the bitterness and narrowness of spite\r\nwith which its upholders have pursued the memory of Rossini is equally\r\noffensive and unwarrantable. Rossini, indeed, did not revolutionize\r\nthe forms of opera as transmitted to him by his predecessors, but he\r\nreformed and perfected them in various notable ways. Both in comic\r\nand serious opera, music owes much to Rossini. He substituted genuine\r\nsinging for the endless recitative of which the Italian opera before him\r\nlargely consisted; he brought the bass and baritone voices to the front,\r\nbanished the pianoforte from the orchestra, and laid down the principle\r\nthat the singer should deliver the notes written for him without\r\nadditions of his own. He gave the chorus a much more important part than\r\nbefore, and elaborated the concerted music, especially in the _finales_,\r\nto a degree of artistic beauty before unknown in the Italian opera.\r\nAbove all, he made the operatic orchestra what it is to-day. Every new\r\ninstrument that was invented Rossini found a place for in his brilliant\r\nscores, and thereby incurred the warmest indignation of all writers\r\nof the old school. Before him the orchestras had consisted largely of\r\nstrings, but Rossini added an equally imposing clement of the brasses\r\nand reeds. True, Mozart had forestalled Rossini in many if not all these\r\ninnovations, a fact which the Italian cheerfully admitted; for, with\r\nthe simple frankness characteristic of the man, he always spoke of his\r\nobligations to and his admiration of the great German. To an admirer who\r\nwas one day burning incense before him, Rossini said, in the spirit of\r\nCimarosa quoted elsewhere: \"My 'Barber' is only a bright farce, but in\r\nMozart's 'Marriage of Figaro' you have the finest possible masterpiece\r\nof musical comedy.\"\r\n\r\nWith all concessions made to Mozart as the founder of the forms of\r\nmodern opera, an equally high place must be given to Rossini for the\r\nvigor and audacity with which he made these available, and impressed\r\nthem on all his contemporaries and successors. Though Rossini's\r\nself-love was flattered by constant adulation, his expressions of\r\nrespect and admiration for such composers as Mozart, Gluck, Beethoven,\r\nand Cherubini display what a catholic and generous nature he possessed.\r\nThe judgment of Ambros, a severe critic, whose bias was against Rossini,\r\nshows what admiration was wrung from him by the last opera of the\r\ncomposer: \"Of all that particularly characterizes Rossini's early operas\r\nnothing is discoverable in 'Tell;' there is none of his usual mannerism;\r\nbut, on the contrary, unusual richness of form and careful finish of\r\ndetail, combined with grandeur of outline. Meretricious embellishment,\r\nshakes, runs, and cadences are carefully avoided in this work, which is\r\nnatural and characteristic throughout; even the melodies have not the\r\nstamp and style of Rossini's earlier times, but only their graceful\r\ncharm and lively coloring.\"\r\n\r\nRossini must be allowed to be unequaled in genuine comic opera, and\r\nto have attained a distinct greatness in serious opera, to be the most\r\ncomprehensive and at the same time the most national composer of Italy,\r\nto be, in short, the Mozart of his country. After all has been admitted\r\nand regretted--that he gave too little attention to musical science;\r\nthat he often neglected to infuse into his work the depth and passion of\r\nwhich it was easily capable; that he placed too high a value on merely\r\nbrilliant effects _ad captandum vulgus_--there remains the fact that his\r\noperas embody a mass of imperishable music, which will live with the\r\nart itself. Musicians of every country now admit his wondrous grace,\r\nhis fertility and freshness of invention, his matchless treatment of the\r\nvoice, his effectiveness in arrangement of the orchestra. He can\r\nnever be made a model, for his genius had too much spontaneity and\r\nindividuality of color. But he impressed and modified music hardly less\r\nthan Gluck, whose tastes and methods were entirely antagonistic to his\r\nown. That he should have retired from the exercise of his art while in\r\nthe full flower of his genius is a perplexing fact. No stranger story\r\nis recorded in the annals of art with respect to a genius who filled\r\nthe world with his glory, and then chose to vanish, \"not unseen.\" On\r\nfinishing his crowning stroke of genius and skill in \"William Tell,\" he\r\nmight have said with Shakespeare's enchanter, Prospero:\r\n\r\n     \".... But this magic I here abjure; and when I have required\r\n     Some heavenly music (which even now I do)\r\n     To work mine end upon their senses that\r\n     This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff--\r\n     Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,\r\n     And, deeper than did ever plummet sound, I'll drown my book.\"\r\n\r\nA bright English critic, whose style is as charming as his judgments are\r\ngood, says, in his study of the Donizetti music: \"I find myself thinking\r\nof his music as I do of Domenichino's pictures of 'St. Agnes' and the\r\n'Rosario' in the Bologna gallery, of the 'Diana' in the Borghese Palace\r\nat Rome, as pictures equable and skillful in the treatment of their\r\nsubjects, neither devoid of beauty of form nor of color, but which\r\nmake neither the pulse quiver nor the eye wet; and then such a sweeping\r\njudgment is arrested by a work like the 'St. Jerome' in the Vatican,\r\nfrom which a spirit comes forth so strong and so exalted, that the\r\nbeholder, however trained to examine, and compare, and collect, finds\r\nhimself raised above all recollections of manner by the sudden ascent\r\nof talent into the higher world of genius. Essentially a second-rate\r\ncomposer,* Donizetti struck out some first-rate things in a happy hour,\r\nsuch as the last act of 'La Favorita.'\"\r\n\r\n     * Mr. Chorley probably means \"second-rate\" as compared with\r\n     the few very great names, which can be easily counted on the\r\n     fingers.\r\n\r\nBoth Donizetti and Bellini, though far inferior to their master in\r\nrichness of resources, in creative faculty and instinct for what may\r\nbe called dramatic expression in pure musical form, were disciples of\r\nRossini in their ideas and methods of work. Milton sang of Shakespeare--\r\n\r\n     \"Sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,\r\n     \"Warbles his native wood-notes wild!\"\r\n\r\nIn a similar spirit, many learned critics have written of Rossini, and\r\nif it can be said of him in a musical sense that he had \"little Latin\r\nand less Greek,\" still more true is it of the two popular composers\r\nwhose works have filled so large a space in the opera-house of the last\r\nthirty years, for their scores are singularly thin, measured by the\r\nstandard of advanced musical science. Specially may this be said of\r\nBellini, in many respects the greater of the two. There is scarcely\r\nto be found in music a more signal example to show that a marked\r\nindividuality may rest on a narrow base. In justice to him, however, it\r\nmay be said that his early death prevented him from doing full justice\r\nto his powers, for he had in him the material out of which the great\r\nartist is made. Let us first sketch the career of Donizetti, the author\r\nof sixty-four operas, besides a mass of other music, such as cantatas,\r\nariettas, duets, church music, etc., in the short space of twenty-six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nGàetano Donizetti was born at Bergamo, September 25, 1798, his father\r\nbeing a man of moderate fortune.*\r\n\r\n     * Admirers of the author of \"Don Pasquale\" and \"Lucia\" may\r\n     be interested in knowing that Donizetti was of Scotch\r\n     descent. His grandfather was a native of Perthshire, named\r\n     Izett. The young Scot was beguiled by the fascinating tongue\r\n     of a recruiting-sergeant into his Britannic majesty's\r\n     service, and was taken prisoner by General La Hoche during\r\n     the latter's invasion of Ireland. Already tired of a\r\n     private's life, he accepted the situation, and was induced\r\n     to become the French general's private secretary.\r\n     Subsequently he drifted to Italy, and married an Italian\r\n     lady of some rank, denationalizing his own name into\r\n     Donizetti. The Scottish predilections of our composer show\r\n     themselves in the music of \"Don Pasquale,\" noticeably in\r\n     \"Com' e gentil;\" and the score of \"Lucia\" is strongly\r\n     flavored by Scottish sympathy and minstrelsy.\r\n\r\nReceiving a good classical education, the young Gäetano had three\r\ncareers open before him: the bar, to which the will of his father\r\ninclined; architecture, indicated by his talent for drawing; and music,\r\nto which he was powerfully impelled by his own inclinations. His\r\nfather sent him, at the age of seventeen, to Bologna to benefit by the\r\ninstruction of Padre Mattel, who had also been Rossini's master. The\r\nyoung man showed no disposition for the heights of musical science as\r\ndemanded by religious composition, and, much to his father's disgust,\r\navowed his determination to write dramatic music. Paternal anger, for\r\nthe elder Donizetti seems to have had a strain of Scotch obstinacy and\r\nausterity, made the youth enlist as a soldier, thinking to find time for\r\nmusical work in the leisure of barrack-life. His first opera, \"Enrico\r\ndi Borgogna,\" was so highly admired by the Venetian manager, to whom, it\r\nwas offered, that he induced friends of his to release young Donizetti\r\nfrom his military servitude. He now pursued musical composition with a\r\nfacility and industry which astonished even the Italians, familiar with\r\nfeats of improvisation. In ten years twenty-eight operas were produced.\r\nSuch names as \"Olivo e Pasquale,\" \"La Convenienze Teatrali,\" \"Il\r\nBorgomaestro di Saardam,\" \"Gianni di Calais,\" \"L'Esule di Roma,\" \"Il\r\nCastello di Kenilworth,\" \"Imelda di Lambertazzi,\" have no musical\r\nsignificance, except as belonging to a catalogue of forgotten titles.\r\nDonizetti was so poorly paid that need drove him to rapid composition,\r\nwhich could not wait for the true afflatus.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1831 that the evidence of a strong individuality was\r\ngiven, for hitherto he had shown little more than a slavish imitation\r\nof Rossini. \"Anna Bolena\" was produced at Milan and gained him great\r\ncredit, and even now, though it is rarely sung even in Italy, it is\r\nmuch respected as a work of art as well as of promise. It was first\r\ninterpreted by Pasta and Rubini, and Lablache won his earliest London\r\ntriumph in it. \"Marino Faliero\" was composed for Paris in 1835, and\r\n\"L'Elisir d'Amore,\" one of the most graceful and pleasing of Donizetti's\r\nworks, for Milan in 1832. \"Lucia di Lammermoor,\" based on Walter Scott's\r\nnovel, was given to the public in 1835, and has remained the most\r\npopular of the composer's operas. _Edgardo_ was written for the great\r\nFrench tenor, Duprez, _Lucia_ for Persiani.\r\n\r\nDonizetti's kindness of heart was illustrated by the interesting\r\ncircumstances of his saving an obscure Neapolitan theatre from ruin.\r\nHearing that it was on the verge of suspension and the performers\r\nin great distress, the composer sought them out and supplied their\r\nimmediate wants. The manager said a new work from the pen of Donizetti\r\nwould be his salvation. \"You shall have one within a week,\" was the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nLacking a subject, he himself rearranged an old French vaudeville, and\r\nwithin the week the libretto was written, the music composed, the parts\r\nlearned, the opera performed, and the theatre saved. There could be no\r\ngreater proof of his generosity of heart and his versatility of talent.\r\nIn these days of bitter quarreling over the rights of authors in their\r\nworks, it may be amusing to know that Victor Hugo contested the rights\r\nof Italian librettists to borrow their plots from French plays. When\r\n\"Lucrezia Borgia,\" composed for Milan in 1834, was produced at Paris\r\nin 1840, the French poet instituted a suit for an infringement of\r\ncopyright. He gained his action, and \"Lucrezia Borgia\" became \"La\r\nRinegata,\" Pope Alexander the Sixth's Italians being metamorphosed into\r\nTurks.*\r\n\r\n     * Victor Hugo did the same thing with Verdi's \"Ernani,\" and\r\n     other French authors followed with legal actions. The matter\r\n     was finally arranged on condition of an indemnity being paid\r\n     to the original French dramatists. The principle involved\r\n     had been established nearly two centuries before. In a\r\n     privilege granted to St. Amant in 1653 for the publication\r\n     of his \"Moïse Sauvé,\" it was forbidden to extract from that\r\n     epic materials for a play or poem. The descendants of\r\n     Beaumarchais fought for the same concession, and not very\r\n     long ago it was decided that the translators and arrangers\r\n     of \"Le Nozze di Figaro\" for the Théâtre Lyrique must share\r\n     their receipts with the living representatives of the author\r\n     of \"Le Mariage de Figaro.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucrezia Borgia,\" which, though based on one of the most dramatic of\r\nstories and full of beautiful music, is not dramatically treated by the\r\ncomposer, seems to mark the distance about half way between the styles\r\nof Rossini and Verdi. In it there is but little recitative, and in the\r\ntreatment of the chorus we find the method which Verdi afterward came to\r\nuse exclusively. When Donizetti revisited Paris in 1840 he produced in\r\nrapid succession \"I Martiri,\" \"La Fille du Regiment,\" and \"La Favorita.\"\r\nIn the second of these works Jenny Lind, Sontag, and Alboni won bright\r\ntriumphs at a subsequent period.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\"La Favorita,\" the story of which was drawn from \"L'Ange de Nigida,\"\r\nand founded in the first instance on a French play, \"Le Comte de\r\nCommingues,\" was put on the stage at the Académie with a magnificent\r\ncast and scenery, and achieved a success immediately great, for as\r\na dramatic opera it stands far in the van of all the composer's\r\nproductions. The whole of the grand fourth act, with the exception of\r\none cavatina, was composed in three hours. Donizetti had been dining at\r\nthe house of a friend, who was engaged in the evening to go to a ball.\r\nOn leaving the house, his host, with profuse apologies, begged\r\nthe composer to stay and finish his coffee, of which Donizetti was\r\ninordinately fond. The latter sent out for music paper, and, finding\r\nhimself in the vein for composition, went on writing till the completion\r\nof the work. He had just put the final stroke to the celebrated \"_Viens\r\ndans un autre patrie_\" when his friend returned at one in the morning\r\nto congratulate him on his excellent method of passing the time, and to\r\nhear the music sung for the first time from Donizetti's own lips.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting Rome, Milan, and Vienna, for which last city he wrote\r\n\"Linda di Chamouni,\" our composer returned to Paris, and in 1843 wrote\r\n\"Don Pasquale\" for the Theatre Italien, and \"Don Sebastian\" for\r\nthe Académie. Its lugubrious drama was fatal to the latter, but the\r\nbrilliant gayety of \"Don Pasquale,\" rendered specially delightful by\r\nsuch a magnificent cast as Grisi, Mario, Tamburini, and Lablache, made\r\nit one of the great art attractions of Paris, and a Fortunatus purse for\r\nthe manager. The music of this work perhaps is the best ever written by\r\nDonizetti, though it lacks the freshness and sentiment of his \"Elisir\r\nd'Amore,\" which is steeped in rustic poetry and tenderness like a rose\r\nwet with dew. The production of \"Maria di Rohan\" in Vienna the same\r\nyear, an opera with some powerful dramatic effects and bold music, gave\r\nRonconi the opportunity to prove himself not merely a fine buffo singer,\r\nbut a noble tragic actor. In this work Donizetti displays that rugged\r\nearnestness and vigor so characteristic of Verdi; and, had his life been\r\ngreatly prolonged, we might have seen him ripen into a passion and power\r\nat odds with the elegant frivolity which for the most part tainted\r\nhis musical quality. Donizetti's last opera, \"Catarina Comaro\" the\r\nsixty-third one represented, was brought out at Naples in the year 1844\r\nwithout adding aught to his reputation. Of this composer's long list of\r\nworks only ten or eleven retain any hold on the stage, his best serious\r\noperas being \"La Favorita,\" \"Linda,\" \"Anna Bolena,\" \"Lucrezia Borgia,\"\r\nand \"Lucia;\" the finest comic works, \"L'Elisir d'Amore,\" \"La Fille du\r\nRegiment,\" and \"Don Pasquale.\"\r\n\r\nIn composing Donizetti never used the pianoforte, writing with great\r\nrapidity and never making corrections. Yet curious to say, he could\r\nnot do anything without a small ivory scraper by his side, though never\r\nusing it. It was given him by his father when commencing his career,\r\nwith the injunction that, as he was determined to become a musician, he\r\nshould make up his mind to write as little rubbish as possible, advice\r\nwhich Donizetti sometimes forgot.\r\n\r\nThe first signs of the malady, which was the cause of the composer's\r\ndeath, had already shown themselves in 1845. Fits of hallucination and\r\nall the symptoms of approaching derangement displayed themselves with\r\nincreasing intensity. An incessant worker, overseer of his operas on\r\ntwenty stages, he had to pay the tax by which his fame became his ruin.\r\nIt is reported that he anticipated the coming scourge, for during the\r\nrehearsals of \"Don Sebastian\" he said, \"I think I shall go mad yet.\"\r\nStill he would not put the bridle on his restless activity. At last\r\nparalysis seized him, and in January, 1846, he was placed under the\r\ncare of the celebrated Dr. Blanche at Ivry. In the hope that the mild\r\ninfluence of his native air might heal his distempered brain, he was\r\nsent to Bergamo, in 1848, but died in his brother's arms April 8th.\r\nThe inhabitants of the Peninsula were then at war with Austria, and\r\nthe bells that sounded the knell of Donizetti's departure mingled their\r\nsolemn peals with the roar of the cannon fired to celebrate the victory\r\nof Goïto.\r\n\r\nHis faithful valet, Antoine, wrote to Adolphe Adam, describing his\r\nobsequies: \"More than four thousand persons,\" he relates, \"were present\r\nat the ceremony. The procession was composed of the numerous clergy of\r\nBergamo, the most illustrious members of the community and its environs,\r\nand of the civic guard of the town and the suburbs. The discharge of\r\nmusketry, mingled with the light of three or four thousand torches,\r\npresented a fine effect; the whole was enhanced by the presence of\r\nthree military bands and the most propitious weather it was possible to\r\nbehold. The young gentlemen of Bergamo insisted on bearing the remains\r\nof their illustrious fellow-townsman, although the cemetery was a league\r\nand a half from the town. The road was crowded its whole length by\r\npeople who came from the surrounding country to witness the procession;\r\nand to give due praise to the inhabitants of Bergamo, never, hitherto,\r\nhad such great honors been bestowed upon any member of that city.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe future author of \"Norma\" and \"La Sonnambula,\" Bellini, took his\r\nfirst lessons in music from his father, an organist at Catania.*\r\n\r\n     * Bellini was born in 1802, nine years after his\r\n     contemporary and rival, Donizetti, and died in 1835,\r\n     thirteen years before.\r\n\r\nHe was sent to the Naples Conservatory by the generosity of a noble\r\npatron, and there was the fellow-pupil of Mercadante, a composer who\r\nblazed into a temporary lustre which threatened to outshine his fellows,\r\nbut is now forgotten except by the antiquarian and the lover of church\r\nmusic. Bellini's early works, for he composed three before he was\r\ntwenty, so pleased Barbaja, the manager of the San Carlo and La Scala,\r\nthat he intrusted the youth with the libretto of \"Il Pirata,\" to be\r\ncomposed for representation at Florence. The tenor part was written for\r\nthe great singer, Rubini, whose name has no peer among artists, since\r\nmale sopranos were abolished by the outraged moral sense of society.\r\nRubini retired to the country with Bellini, and studied, as they were\r\nproduced, the simple touching airs with which he so delighted the public\r\non the stage.\r\n\r\nLa Scala rang with plaudits when the opera was produced, and Bellini's\r\ncareer was assured. \"I Capuletti\" was his next successful opera,\r\nperformed at Venice in 1829, but it never became popular out of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe significant period of Bellini's life was in the year 1831, which\r\nproduced \"La Sonnambula,\" to be followed by \"Norma\" the next season.\r\nBoth these were written for and introduced before the Neapolitan public.\r\nIn these works he reached his highest development, and by them he is\r\nbest known to fame. The opera-story of \"La Sonnambula,\" by Romani,\r\nan accomplished writer and scholar, is one of the most artistic and\r\neffective ever put into the hands of a composer. M. Scribe had already\r\nused the plot both as the subject of a vaudeville and a chorégraphie\r\ndrama; but in Romani's hands it became a symmetrical story full of\r\npoetry and beauty. The music of this opera, throbbing with pure melody\r\nand simple emotion, as natural and fresh as a bed of wild flowers, went\r\nto the heart of the universal public, learned and unlearned; and, in\r\nspite of its scientific faults, it will never cease to delight future\r\ngenerations, as long as hearts beat and eyes are moistened with human\r\ntenderness and sympathy. And yet, of this work an English critic wrote,\r\non its first London presentation:\r\n\r\n\"Bellini has soared too high; there is nothing of grandeur, no touch of\r\ntrue pathos in the common-place workings of his mind. He cannot reach\r\nthe _opera semiseria_; he should confine his powers to the musical\r\ndrama, the one-act _opera buffa_.\" But the history of art-criticism is\r\nreplete with such instances.\r\n\r\n\"Norma\" was also a grand triumph for the young composer from the outset,\r\nespecially as the lofty character of the Druid priestess was sung by\r\nthat unapproachable lyric tragedienne, the Siddons of the opera, Madame\r\nPasta. Bellini is said to have had this queen of dramatic song in\r\nhis mind in writing the opera, and right nobly did she vindicate his\r\njudgment, for no European audience afterward but was thrilled and\r\ncarried away by her masterpiece of acting and singing in this part.\r\n\r\nBellini himself considered \"Norma\" his _chef d'oeuvre_. A beautiful\r\nParisienne attempted to extract from his reluctant lips his preference\r\nof his own works. The lady finally overcame his evasions by the query:\r\n\"But if you were out at sea, and should be shipwrecked--\" \"Ah!\" he\r\ncried, without allowing her to finish. \"I would leave all the rest and\r\ntry to save 'Norma.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I Puritani\" was composed for and performed at Paris in 1834, by that\r\nsplendid quartette of artists, Grisi, Rubini, Tamburini, and Lablache.\r\nBellini compelled the singers to execute after _his_ style. While Rubini\r\nwas rehearsing the tenor part, the composer cried out in rage: \"You put\r\nno life into your music. Show some feeling. Don't you know what love\r\nis?\" Then changing his tone: \"Don't you know your voice is a goldmine\r\nthat has not been fully explored? You are an excellent artist, but that\r\nis not sufficient. You must forget yourself and represent _Gualtiero_.\r\nLet's try again.\" The tenor, stung by the admonition, then gave the part\r\nmagnificently. After the success of \"I Puritani,\" the composer received\r\nthe Cross of the Legion of Honor, an honor then not often bestowed.\r\nThe \"Puritani\" season is still remembered, it is said, with peculiar\r\npleasure by the older connoisseurs of Paris and London, as the\r\nenthusiasm awakened in musical circles has rarely been equaled.\r\n\r\nBellini had placed himself under contract to write two new works\r\nimmediately, one for Paris, the other for Naples, and retired to the\r\nvilla of a friend at Puteaux to insure the more complete seclusion.\r\nHere, while pursuing his art with almost sleepless ardor, he was\r\nattacked by his fatal malady, intestinal fever.\r\n\r\n\"From his youth up,\" says his biographer Mould, \"Vincenzo's eagerness in\r\nhis art was such as to keep him at the piano night and day, till he was\r\nobliged forcibly to leave it. The ruling passion accompanied him through\r\nhis short life, and by the assiduity with which he pursued it brought on\r\nthe dysentery which closed his brilliant career, peopling his last\r\nhours with the figures of those to whom his works owed so much of their\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the moments of delirium which preceded his death, he was\r\nconstantly speaking of Lablache, Tamburini, and Grisi; and one of his\r\nlast recognizable impressions was that he was present at a brilliant\r\nrepresentation of his last opera at the Salle Favart. His earthly career\r\nclosed September 23, 1835, at the age of thirty-one.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of his interment, the Théâtre Italien reopened with the\r\n\"Puritani.\" It was an occasion full of solemn gloom. Both the\r\nmusicians and audience broke from time to time into sobs. Tamburini, in\r\nparticular, was so oppressed by the death of his young friend that his\r\nvocalization, generally so perfect, was often at fault, while the faces\r\nof Grisi, Rubini, and Lablache too plainly showed their aching hearts.\r\n\r\nRossini, Cherubini, Paer, and Carafa had charge of the funeral, and M.\r\nHabeneck, _chef d'orchestre_ of the Académie Royale, of the music. The\r\nnext remarkable piece on the funeral programme was a _Lacrymosa_ for\r\nfour voices without accompaniment, in which the text of the Latin\r\nhymn was united to the beautiful tenor melody in the third act of\r\nthe \"Puritani.\" This was executed by Rubini, Ivanoff, Tamburini, and\r\nLablache. The services were performed at the Church of the Invalides,\r\nand the remains were interred in Père Lachaise.\r\n\r\nRossini had ever shown great love for Bellini, and Rosario Bellini,\r\nthe stricken father, wrote to him a touching letter, in which, after\r\nspeaking of his grief and despair, the old man said:\r\n\r\n\"You always encouraged the object of my eternal regret in his labors;\r\nyou took him under your protection, you neglected nothing that could\r\nincrease his glory and his welfare. After my son's death, what have\r\nyou not done to honor my son's name and render it dear to posterity? I\r\nlearned this from the newspapers; and I am penetrated with gratitude for\r\nyour excessive kindness as well as for that of a number of distinguished\r\nartists, which also I shall never forget. Pray, sir, be my interpreter,\r\nand tell these artists that the father and family of Bellini, as well as\r\nof our compatriots of Catania, will cherish an imperishable recollection\r\nof this generous conduct. I shall never cease to remember how much you\r\ndid for my son. I shall make known everywhere, in the midst of my tears,\r\nwhat an affectionate heart belongs to the great Rossini, and how kind,\r\nhospitable, and full of feeling are the artists of France.\"\r\n\r\nBellini was affable, sincere, honest, and affectionate. Nature gave him\r\na beautiful and ingenuous face, noble features, large, clear blue eyes,\r\nand abundant light hair. His countenance instantly won on the regards\r\nof all that met him. His disposition was melancholy; a secret depression\r\noften crept over his most cheerful hours. We are told there was a\r\ntender romance in his earlier life. The father of the lady he loved,\r\na Neapolitan judge, refused his suit on account of his inferior social\r\nposition. When Bellini became famous the judge wished to make amends,\r\nbut Bellini's pride interfered. Soon after the young lady, who loved him\r\nunalterably, died, and it was said the composer never recovered from the\r\nshock.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nDonizetti and Bellini were peculiarly moulded by the great genius of\r\nRossini, but in their best works they show individuality, color, and\r\nspecial creative activity. The former composer, one of the most affluent\r\nin the annals of music, seemed to become more fresh in his fancies\r\nwith increased production. He is an example of how little the skill and\r\ntouch, belonging to unceasing work, should be despised in comparison\r\nwith what is called inspiration. Donizetti arrived at his freshest\r\ncreations at a time when there seemed but little left for him except the\r\ntrite and threadbare. There are no melodies so rich and well fancied as\r\nthose to be found in his later works; and in sense of dramatic form\r\nand effective instrumentation (always a faulty point with Donizetti) he\r\ndisplayed great progress at the last. It is, however, a noteworthy fact,\r\nthat the latest Italian composers have shown themselves quite weak\r\nin composing expressly for the orchestra. No operatic overture since\r\n\"William Tell\" has been produced by this school of music, worthy to be\r\nrendered in a concert-room.\r\n\r\nDonizetti lacked the dramatic instinct in conceiving his music. In\r\nattempting it he became hollow and theatric; and beautiful as are the\r\nmelodies and concerted pieces in \"Lucia,\" where the subject ought to\r\ninspire a vivid dramatic nature with such telling effects, it is in the\r\nlatter sense one of the most disappointing of operas.\r\n\r\nHe redeemed himself for the nonce, however, in the fourth act of \"La\r\nFavorita,\" where there is enough musical and dramatic beauty to condone\r\nthe sins of the other three acts. The solemn and affecting church chant,\r\nthe passionate romance for the tenor, the great closing duet in which\r\nthe ecstasy of despair rises to that of exaltation, the resistless\r\nsweep of the rhythm--all mark one of the most effective single acts ever\r\nwritten. He showed himself here worthy of companionship with Rossini and\r\nMeyerbeer.\r\n\r\nIn his comic operas, \"L'Elisir d'Amore,\" \"La Fille du Regiment,\" and\r\n\"Don Pasquale,\" there is a continual well-spring of sunny, bubbling\r\nhumor. They are slight, brilliant, and catching, everything that\r\npedantry condemns, and the popular taste delights in. Mendelssohn, the\r\nlast of the German classical composers, admired \"L'Elisir\" so much that\r\nhe said he would have liked to have written it himself. It may be said\r\nthat while Donizetti lacks grand conceptions, or even great heauties\r\nfor the most part, his operas contain so much that is agreeable, so many\r\nexcellent opportunities for vocal display, such harmony between sound\r\nand situation, that he will probably retain a hold on the stage when\r\nmuch greater composers are only known to the general public by name.\r\n\r\nBellini, with less fertility and grace, possessed far more\r\npicturesqueness and intensity. His powers of imagination transcended his\r\ncommand over the working tools of his art. Even more lacking in exact\r\nand extended musical science than Donizetti, he could express what came\r\nwithin his range with a simple vigor, grasp, and beauty, which make\r\nhim a truly dramatic composer. In addition to this, a matter which many\r\ngreat composers ignore, Bellini had extraordinary skill in writing music\r\nfor the voice, not that which merely gave opportunity for executive\r\ntrickery and embellishment, but the genuine accents of passion, pathos,\r\nand tenderness, in forms best adapted to be easily and effectively\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nHe had no flexibility, no command over mirthful inspiration, such as\r\nwe hear in Mozart, Rossini, or even Donizetti. But his monotone is in\r\nsublile rapport with the graver aspects of nature and life. Chorley sums\r\nup this characteristic of Bellini in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"In spite of the inexperience with which the instrumental score is\r\nfilled up, the opening scene of 'Norma' in the dim druidical wood\r\nbears the true character of ancient sylvan antiquity. There is daybreak\r\nagain--a fresh tone of reveille--in the prelude to 'I Puritani.' If\r\nBellini's genius was not versatile in its means of expression, if it had\r\nnot gathered all the appliances by which science fertilizes Nature, it\r\nbeyond all doubt included appreciation of truth, no less than instinct\r\nfor beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDI.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 the Khédive of Egypt, an oriental ruler, whose love of western\r\nart and civilization has since tangled him in economic meshes to escape\r\nfrom which has cost him his independence, produced a new opera with\r\nbarbaric splendor of appointments, at Grand Cairo. The spacious theatre\r\nblazed with fantastic dresses and showy uniforms, and the curtain rose\r\non a drama which gave a glimpse to the Arabs, Copts, and Francs present\r\nof the life and religion, the loves and hates of ancient Pharaonic\r\ntimes, set to music by the most celebrated of living Italian composers.\r\n\r\nThat an eastern prince should have commissioned Giuseppe Verdi to write\r\n\"Aida\" for him, in his desire to emulate western sovereigns as a patron\r\nof art, is an interesting fact, but not wonderful or significant.\r\n\r\nThe opera itself was freighted, however, with peculiar significance as\r\nan artistic work, far surpassing that of the circumstances which gave it\r\norigin, or which saw its first production in the mysterious land of the\r\nNile and Sphinx.\r\n\r\nOriginally a pupil, thoroughly imbued with the method and spirit of\r\nRossini, though never lacking in original quality, Verdi as a young man\r\nshared the suffrages of admiring audiences with Donizetti and Bellini.\r\nEven when he diverged widely from his parent stem and took rank as the\r\nrepresentative of the melodramatic school of music, he remained true to\r\nthe instincts of his Italian training.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable fact is that Verdi, at the age of fifty-eight, when it\r\nmight have been safely assumed that his theories and preferences were\r\nfinally crystallized, produced an opera in which he clasped hands with\r\nthe German enthusiast, who preached an art system radically opposed to\r\nhis own and lashed with scathing satire the whole musical cult of the\r\nItalian race.\r\n\r\nIn \"Aida\" and the \"Manzoni Mass,\" written in 1873, Verdi, the leader\r\namong living Italian composers, practically conceded that, in the long,\r\nbitterly fought battle between Teuton and Italian in music, the former\r\nwas the victor. In the opera we find a new departure, which, if not\r\nembodying all the philosophy of the \"new school,\" is stamped with its\r\nsalient traits, viz.: The subordination of all the individual effects\r\nto the perfection and symmetry of the whole; a lavish demand on all the\r\nsister arts to contribute their rich gifts to the heightening of the\r\nillusion; a tendency to enrich the harmonic value in the choruses, the\r\nconcerted pieces, and the instrumentation, to the great sacrifice of the\r\nsolo pieces; the use of the heroic and mythical element as a theme.\r\n\r\nVerdi, the subject of this interesting revolution, has filled a very\r\nbrilliant place in modern musical art, and his career has been in some\r\nways as picturesque as his music.\r\n\r\nVerdi's parents were literally hewers of wood and drawers of water,\r\nearning their bread, after the manner of Italian peasants, at a small\r\nsettlement called La Roncali, near Busseto, where the future composer\r\nwas born on October 9, 1814.\r\n\r\nHis earliest recollections were with the little village church, where\r\nthe little Giuseppe listened with delight to the church organ, for, as\r\nwith all great musicians, his fondness for music showed itself at a very\r\nearly age. The elder Verdi, though very poor, gratified the child's love\r\nof music when he was about eight by buying a small spinet, and placing\r\nhim under the instruction of Provesi, a teacher in Busseto. The boy\r\nentered on his studies with ardor, and made more rapid progress than the\r\nslender facilities which were allowed him would ordinarily justify.\r\n\r\nAn event soon occurred which was destined to wield a lasting influence\r\non his destiny. He one day heard a skillful performance on a fine piano,\r\nwhile passing by one of the better houses of Busseto. From that time\r\na constant fascination drew him to the house; for day after day he\r\nlingered and seemed unwilling to go away lest he should perchance lose\r\nsome of the enchanting sounds which so enraptured him. The owner of\r\nthe premises was a rich merchant, one Antonio Barezzi, a cultivated\r\nand high-minded man, and a passionate lover of music withal. 'Twas his\r\ndaughter whose playing gave the young Verdi such pleasure.\r\n\r\nSignor Barezzi had often seen the lingering and absorbed lad, who\r\nstood as if in a dream, oblivious to all that passed around him in the\r\npractical work-a-day world. So one day he accosted him pleasantly and\r\ninquired why he came so constantly and stayed so long doing nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I play the piano a little,\" said the boy, \"and I like to come here and\r\nlisten to the fine playing in your house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! if that is the case, come in with me that you may enjoy it more\r\nat your ease, and hereafter you are welcome to do so whenever you feel\r\ninclined.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined the delighted boy did not refuse the kind invitation,\r\nand the acquaintance soon ripened into intimacy, for the rich merchant\r\nlearned to regard the bright young musician with much affection, which\r\nit is needless to say was warmly returned. Verdi was untiring in study\r\nand spent the early years of his youth in humble quiet, in the midst of\r\nthose beauties of nature which have so powerful an influence in molding\r\ngreat susceptibilities. At his seventeenth year he had acquired as much\r\nmusical knowledge as could be acquired at a place like Busseto, and he\r\nbecame anxious to go to Milan to continue his studies. The poverty of\r\nhis family precluding any assistance from this quarter, he was obliged\r\nto find help from an eleemosynary fund then existing in his native town.\r\nThis was an institution called the Monte di Pietà, which offered yearly\r\nto four young men the sum of twenty-five _lire_ a month each, in order\r\nto help them to an education; and Verdi, making an application and\r\nsustained by the influence of his friend the rich merchant, was one of\r\nthe four whose good fortune it was to be selected.\r\n\r\nThe allowance thus obtained with some assistance from Barezzi enabled\r\nthe ambitious young musician to go to Milan, carrying with him some\r\nof his compositions. When he presented himself for examination at the\r\nconservatory, he was made to play on the piano, and his compositions\r\nexamined. The result fell on his hopes like a thunder-bolt. The pedantic\r\nand narrow-minded examiners not only scoffed at the state of his musical\r\nknowledge, but told him he was incapable of becoming a musician. To\r\nweaker souls this would have been a terrible discouragement, but to his\r\nardor and self-confidence it was only a challenge. Barezzi had equal\r\nconfidence in the abilities of his _protégé_, and warmly encouraged him\r\nto work and hope. Verdi engaged an excellent private teacher and pursued\r\nhis studies with unflagging energy, denying himself all but the barest\r\nnecessities, and going sometimes without sufficient food.\r\n\r\nA stroke of fortune now fell in his way; the place of organist fell\r\nvacant at the Busseto church, and Verdi was appointed to fill it. He\r\nreturned home, and was soon afterward married to the daughter of the\r\nbenefactor to whom he owed so much. He continued to apply himself with\r\ngreat diligence to the study of his art, and completed an opera early\r\nin 1839. He succeeded in arranging for the production of this work,\r\n\"L'Oberto, Conte de San Bonifacio,\" at La Scala, Milan; but it excited\r\nlittle comment and was soon forgotten, like the scores of other shallow\r\nor immature compositions so prolifically produced in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe impresario, Merelli, believed in the young composer though, for\r\nhe thought he discovered signs of genius. So he gave him a contract to\r\nwrite three operas, one of which was to be an _opera buffa_, and to be\r\nready in the following autumn. With hopeful spirits Verdi set to work\r\non the opera, but that year of 1840 was to be one of great trouble and\r\ntrial. Hardly had he set to work all afire with eagerness and hope,\r\nwhen he was seized with severe illness. His recovery was followed by the\r\nsuccessive sickening of his two children, who died, a terrible blow to\r\nthe father's fond heart. Fate had the crowning stroke though still to\r\ngive, for the young mother, agonized by this loss, was seized with a\r\nfatal inflammation of the brain. Thus within a brief period Verdi was\r\nbereft of all the sweet consolations of home, and his life became a\r\nburden to him. Under these conditions he was to write a comic opera,\r\nfull of sparkle, gayety, and humor. Can we wonder that his work was a\r\nfailure? The public came to be amused by bright, joyous music, for it\r\nwas nothing to them that the composer's heart was dead with grief at his\r\nafflictions. The audience hissed \"Un Giorno di Regno,\" for it proved\r\na funereal attempt at mirth. So Verdi sought to annul the contract. To\r\nthis the impresario replied: \"So be it, if you wish; but, whenever you\r\nwant to write again on the same terms, you will find me ready.\"\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, the composer was discouraged by his want of success,\r\nand wholly broken down by his numerous trials. He now withdrew from all\r\nsociety, and, having hired a small room in an out-of-the-way part of\r\nMilan, passed most of his time in reading the worst books that could\r\nbe found, rarely going out, unless occasionally in the evening, never\r\ngiving his attention to study of any kind, and never touching the piano.\r\nSuch was his life from October, 1840, to January, 1841. One evening,\r\nearly in the new year, while out walking, he chanced to meet Merelli,\r\nwho took him by the arm; and, as they sauntered toward the theatre, the\r\nimpresario told him that he was in great trouble, Nicolai, who was to\r\nwrite an opera for him, having refused to accept a _libretto_ entitled\r\n\"Nabucco.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Verdi replied:\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to be able to relieve you of your difficulty. Don't you\r\nremember the libretto of 'Il Proscritto,' which you procured for me, and\r\nfor which I have never composed the music? Give that to Nicolai in place\r\nof 'Nabucco.'\"\r\n\r\nMerelli thanked him for his kind offer, and, as they reached the\r\ntheatre, asked him to go in, that they might ascertain whether the\r\nmanuscript of \"Il Proscritto\" was really there. It was at length found,\r\nand Verdi was on the point of leaving, when Merelli slipped into his\r\npocket the book of \"Nabucco,\" asking him to look it over. For want\r\nof something to do, he took up the drama the next morning and read it\r\nthrough, realizing how truly grand it was in conception. But, as a lover\r\nforces himself to feign indifference to his coquettish _innamorata_, so\r\nhe, disregarding his inclinations, returned the manuscript to Merelli\r\nthat same day.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Merelli, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Musicabilissimo!\" he replied; \"full of dramatic power and telling\r\nsituations!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it home with you, then, and write the music for it.\"\r\n\r\nVerdi declared that he did not wish to compose, but the worthy\r\nimpresario forced the manuscript on him, and persisted that he should\r\nundertake the work. The composer returned home with the libretto, but\r\nthrew it on one side without looking at it, and for the next five months\r\ncontinued his reading of bad romances and yellow-covered novels.\r\n\r\nThe impulse of work soon came again, however. One beautiful June day the\r\nmanuscript met his eye, while looking listlessly over some old papers.\r\nHe read one scene and was struck by its beauty. The instinct of musical\r\ncreation rushed over him with irresistible force; he seated himself at\r\nthe piano, so long silent, and began composing the music. The ice was\r\nbroken. Verdi soon entered into the spirit of the work, and in three\r\nmonths \"Nabucco\" was entirely completed. Merelli gladly accepted it, and\r\nit was performed at La Scala in the spring of 1842. As a result Verdi\r\nwas besieged with petitions for new works from every impresario in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFrom 1812 to 1851 Verdi's busy imagination produced a series of operas,\r\nwhich disputed the palm of popularity with the foremost composers of his\r\ntime. \"I Lombardi,\" brought out at La Scala in 1843; \"Ernani,\" at Venice\r\nin 1844; \"I Due Foscari,\" at Rome in 1844; \"Giovanna D'Arco,\" at Milan,\r\nand \"Alzira,\" at Naples in 1845; \"Attila,\" at Venice in 1846; and\r\n\"Macbetto,\" at Florence in 1847, were--all of them--successful works.\r\nThe last created such a genuine enthusiasm that he was crowned with a\r\ngolden aurel-wreath and escorted home from the theatre by an enormous\r\ncrowd. \"I Masnadieri\" was written for Jenny Lind, and performed first\r\nin London in 1847 with that great singer, Gardoni, and Lablache, in the\r\ncast. His next productions were \"Il Corsaro,\" brought out at Trieste\r\nin 1848; \"La Battaglia di Legnano\" at Rome in 1849; \"Luisa Miller\" at\r\nNaples in the same year; and \"Stiffelio\" at Trieste in 1850. By this\r\nseries of works Verdi impressed himself powerfully on his age, but in\r\nthem he preserved faithfully the color and style of the school in which\r\nhe had been trained. But he had now arrived at the commencement of his\r\ntransition period. A distinguished French critic marks this change in\r\nthe following summary: \"When Verdi began to write, the influences of\r\nforeign literature and new theories on art had excited Italian\r\ncomposers to seek a violent expression of the passions, and to leave\r\nthe interpretation of amiable and delicate sentiments for that of sombre\r\nflights of the soul. A serious mind gifted with a rich imagination,\r\nVerdi became the chief of the new school. His music became more intense\r\nand dramatic; by vigor, energy, _verve_, a certain ruggedness and\r\nsharpness, by powerful effects of sound, he conquered an immense\r\npopularity in Italy, where success had hitherto been attained only by\r\nthe charm, suavity, and abundance of the melodies produced.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Rigoletto,\" produced in Venice in 1851, the full flowering of his\r\ngenius into the melodramatic style was signally shown. The opera story\r\nadapted from Victor Hugo's \"Le Roi s'amuse\" is itself one of the most\r\ndramatic of plots, and it seemed to have fired the composer into music\r\nsingularly vigorous, full of startling effects and novel treatment. Two\r\nyears afterward were brought out at Rome and Venice respectively two\r\noperas, stamped with the same salient qualities, \"Il Trovatore\" and\r\n\"La Traviata,\" the last a lyric adaptation of Dumas _fils's_ \"Dame\r\naux Camélias.\" These three operas have generally been considered his\r\nmasterpieces, though it is more than possible that the riper judgment of\r\nthe future will not sustain this claim. Their popularity was such that\r\nVerdi's time was absorbed for several years in their production at\r\nvarious opera-houses, utterly precluding new compositions. Of his later\r\noperas may be mentioned \"Les Vêpres Siciliennes,\" produced in Paris in\r\n1855; \"Un Ballo in Maschera,\" performed at Rome in 1859; \"La Forza del\r\nDestino,\" written for St. Petersburg, where it was sung in 1863; \"Don\r\nCarlos,\" produced in London in 1867; and \"Aida\" in Grand Cairo in\r\n1872. When the latter work was finished, Verdi had composed twenty-nine\r\noperas, beside lesser works, and attained the age of fifty-seven.\r\n\r\nVerdi's energies have not been confined to music. An ardent patriot, he\r\nhas displayed the deepest interest in the affairs of his country, and\r\ntaken an active part in its tangled politics. After the war of 1859 he\r\nwas chosen a member of the Assembly of Parma, and was one of the most\r\ninfluential advocates for the annexation to Sardinia. Italian unity\r\nfound in him a passionate advocate, and, when the occasion came, his\r\nartistic talent and earnestness proved that they might have made a\r\nvigorous mark in political oratory as well as in music.\r\n\r\nThe cry of \"Viva Verdi\" often resounded through Sardinia and Italy, and\r\nit was one of the war-slogans of the Italian war of liberation. This\r\nenigma is explained in the fact that the five letters of his name are\r\nthe initials of those of Vittorio Emanuele Rè D'Italia. His private\r\nresources were liberally poured forth to help the national cause, and in\r\n1861 he was chosen a deputy in Parliament from Parma. Ten years later he\r\nwas appointed by the Minister of Public Instruction to superintend the\r\nreorganization of the National Musical Institute.\r\n\r\nThe many decorations and titular distinctions lavished on him show the\r\nhigh esteem in which he is held. He is a member of the Legion of Honor,\r\ncorresponding member of the French Academy of Fine Arts, grand cross\r\nof the Prussian order of St. Stanislaus, of the order of the Crown of\r\nItaly, and of the Egyptian order of Osmanli. He divides his life between\r\na beautiful residence at Genoa, where he overlooks the waters of the\r\nsparkling Mediterranean, and a country villa near his native Busseto,\r\na house of quaint artistic architecture, approached by a venerable,\r\nmoss-grown stone bridge, at the foot of which are a large park and\r\nartificial lake. When he takes his evening walks, the peasantry, who are\r\ndevotedly attached to him, unite in singing choruses from his operas.\r\n\r\nIn Verdi's bedroom, where alone he composes, is a fine piano--of which\r\ninstrument, as well as of the violin, he is a master--a modest library,\r\nand an oddly-shaped writing-desk. Pictures and statuettes, of which he\r\nis very fond, are thickly strewn about the whole house. Verdi is a\r\nman of vigor' ous and active habits, taking an ardent interest in\r\nagriculture. But the larger part of his time is taken up in composing,\r\nwriting letters, and reading works on philosophy, politics, and history.\r\nHis personal appearance is very distinguished. A tall figure with sturdy\r\nlimbs and square shoulders, surmounted by a finely-shaped head; abundant\r\nhair, beard, and mustache, whose black is sprinkled with gray; dark-gray\r\neyes, regular features, and an earnest, sometimes intense, expression\r\nmake him a noticeable-looking man. Much sought after in the brilliant\r\nsociety of Florence, Rome, and Paris, our composer spends most of his\r\ntime in the elegant seclusion of home.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nVerdi is the most nervous, theatric, sensuous composer of the present\r\ncentury. Measured by the highest standard, his style must be criticised\r\nas often spasmodic, tawdry, and meretricious. He instinctively adopts\r\na bold and eccentric treatment of musical themes; and, though there are\r\nalways to be found stirring movements in his scores as well as in his\r\nopera stories, he constantly offends refined taste by sensation and\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nWith a redundancy of melody, too often of the cheap and shallow kind, he\r\nrarely fails to please the masses of opera-goers, for his works enjoy\r\na popularity not shared at present by any other composer. In Verdi a\r\nsudden blaze of song, brief spirited airs, duets, trios, etc., take\r\nthe place of the elaborate and beautiful music, chiseled into order and\r\nsymmetry, which characterizes most of the great composers of the past.\r\nEnergy of immediate impression is thus gained at the expense of that\r\ndeep, lingering power, full of the subtile side-lights and shadows of\r\nsuggestion, which is the crowning benison of great music. He stuns the\r\near and captivates the senses, but does not subdue the soul.\r\n\r\nYet, despite the grievous faults of these operas, they blaze with gems,\r\nand we catch here and there true swallow-flights of genius, that the\r\nnoblest would not disown. With all his puerilities there is a mixture\r\nof grandeur. There are passages in \"Ernani,\" \"Rigoletto,\" \"Traviata,\"\r\n\"Trovatore,\" and \"Aida,\" so strong and dignified, that it provokes a\r\nwonder that one with such capacity for greatness should often descend\r\ninto such bathos.\r\n\r\nTo better illustrate the false art which mars so much of Verdi's\r\ndramatic method, a comparison between his \"Rigoletto,\" so often claimed\r\nas his best work, and Rossini's \"Otello\" will be opportune. The air sung\r\nby _Gilda_ in the \"Rigoletto,\" when she retires to sleep on the eve of\r\nthe outrage, is an empty, sentimental yawn; and in the quartet of\r\nthe last act, a noble dramatic opportunity, she ejects a chain of\r\ndisconnected, unmusical sobs, as offensive as _Violetta's_ consumptive\r\ncough. _Desdemona's_ agitated air, on the other hand, under Rossini's\r\ntreatment, though broken short in the vocal phrase, is magnificently\r\nsustained by the orchestra, and a genuine passion is made consistently\r\nmusical; and then the wonderful burst of bravura, where despair and\r\nresolution run riot without violating the bounds of strict beauty in\r\nmusic--these are master-strokes of genius restrained by art.\r\n\r\nIn Verdi, passion too often misses intensity and becomes hysterical.\r\nHe lacks the elements of tenderness and humor, but is frequently\r\npicturesque and charming by his warmth and boldness of color. His\r\nattempts to express the gay and mirthful, as for instance in the\r\nmasquerade music of \"Traviata\" and the dance music of \"Rigoletto,\" are\r\ndreary, ghastly, and saddening; while his ideas of tenderness are apt\r\nto take the form of mere sentimentality. Yet generalities fail in\r\ndescribing him, for occasionally he attains effects strong in their\r\npathos, and artistically admirable; as, for example, the slow air for\r\nthe heroine, and the dreamy song for the gypsy mother in the last act\r\nof \"Trovatore.\" An artist who thus contradicts himself is a perplexing\r\nproblem, but we must judge him by the habitual, not the occasional.\r\n\r\nVerdi is always thoroughly in earnest, never frivolous. He walks on\r\nstilts indeed, instead of treading the ground or cleaving the air,\r\nbut is never timid or tame in aim or execution. If he cannot stir the\r\nemotions of the soul he subdues and absorbs the attention against\r\neven the dictates of the better taste; while genuiue beauties gleaming\r\nthrough picturesque rubbish often repay the true musician for what he\r\nhas undergone.\r\n\r\nSo far this composer has been essentially representative of melodramatic\r\nmusic, with all the faults and virtues of such a style. In \"Aida,\"\r\nhis last work, the world remarked a striking change. The noble\r\norchestration, the power and beauty of the choruses, the sustained\r\ndignity of treatment, the seriousness and pathos of the whole work,\r\nreveal how deeply new purposes and methods have been fermenting in the\r\ncomposer's development. Yet in the very prime of his powers, though\r\nno longer young, his next work ought to settle the value of the hopes\r\nraised by the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERUBINI AND HIS PREDECESSORS.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn France, as in Italy, the regular musical drama was preceded by\r\nmysteries, masks, and religious plays, which introduced short musical\r\nparts, as also action, mechanical effects, and dancing. The ballet,\r\nhowever, where dancing was the prominent feature, remained for a long\r\ntime the favorite amusement of the French court until the advent of Jean\r\nBaptiste Lulli. The young Florentine, after having served in the king's\r\nband, was promoted to be its chief, and the composer of the music of\r\nthe court ballets. Lulli, born in 1633, was bought of his parents\r\nby Chevalier de Guise, and sent to Paris as a present to Mlle, de\r\nMontpensier, the king's niece. His capricious mistress, after a year\r\nor two, deposed the boy of fifteen from the position of page to that of\r\nscullion; but Count Nogent, accidentally hearing him sing and struck by\r\nhis musical talent, influenced the princess to place him under the care\r\nof good masters. Lulli made such rapid progress that he soon commenced\r\nto compose music of a style superior to that before current in\r\ndivertissements of the French court.\r\n\r\nThe name of Philippe Quinault is closely associated with the musical\r\ncareer of Lulli; for to the poet the musician was indebted for his best\r\nlibrettos. Born at Paris in 1636, Quinault's genius for poetry displayed\r\nitself at an early age. Before he was twenty he had written several\r\nsuccessful comedies. Though he produced many plays, both tragedies and\r\ncomedies, well known to readers of French poetry, his operatic poems are\r\nthose which have rendered his memory illustrious. He died on November\r\n29,1688. It is said that during his last illness he was extremely\r\npenitent on account of the voluptuous tendency of his works. All his\r\nlyrical dramas are full of beauty, but \"Atys,\" \"Phaeton,\" \"Isis,\" and\r\n\"Armide\" have been ranked the highest. \"Armide\" was the last of the\r\npoet's efforts, and Lulli was so much in love with the opera, when\r\ncompleted, that he had it performed over and over again for his own\r\npleasure without any other auditor. When \"Atys\" was performed first in\r\n1676, the eager throng began to pour in the theatre at ten o'clock in\r\nthe morning, and by noon the building was filled. The King and the Count\r\nwere charmed with the work in spite of the bitter dislike of Boileau,\r\nthe Aristarchus of his age. \"Put me in a place where I shall not be able\r\nto hear the words,\" said the latter to the box-keeper; \"I like Lulli's\r\nmusic very much, but have a sovereign contempt for Quinault's words.\"\r\nLulli obliged the poet to write \"Armide\" five times over, and the\r\nfelicity of his treatment is proved by the fact that Gluck afterward set\r\nthe same poem to the music which is still occasionally sung in Germany.\r\n\r\nLulli in the course of his musical career became so great a favorite\r\nwith the King that the originally obscure kitchen-boy was ennobled. He\r\nwas made one of the King's secretaries in spite of the loud murmurs of\r\nthis pampered fraternity against receiving into their body a player\r\nand a buffoon. The musician's wit and affability, however, finally\r\ndissipated these prejudices, especially as he was wealthy and of\r\nirreproachable character.\r\n\r\nThe King having had a severe illness in 1686, Lulli composed a \"Te Deum\"\r\nin honor of his recovery. When this was given, the musician, in beating\r\ntime with great ardor, struck his toe with his baton. This brought on a\r\nmortification, and there was great grief when it was announced that he\r\ncould not recover. The Princes de Vendôme lodged four thousand pistoles\r\nin the hands of a banker, to be paid to any physician who would cure\r\nhim. Shortly before his death his confessor severely reproached him for\r\nthe licentiousness of his operas, and refused to give him absolution\r\nunless he consented to burn the score of \"Achille et Polyxène,\" which\r\nwas ready for the stage. The manuscript was put into the flames, and\r\nthe priest made the musician's peace with God. One of the young princes\r\nvisited him a few days after, when he seemed a little better.\r\n\r\n\"What, Baptiste,\" the former said, \"have you burned your opera? You were\r\na fool for giving such credit to a gloomy confessor and burning good\r\nmusic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush!\" whispered Lulli with a satirical smile on his lip. \"I\r\ncheated the good father. I only burned a copy.\"\r\n\r\nHe died singing the words, \"Il faut mourir, pécheur, il faut mourir\" to\r\none of his own opera airs.\r\n\r\nLulli was not only a composer, but created his own orchestra, trained\r\nhis artists in acting and singing, and was machinist as well as\r\nballet-master and music-director. He was intimate with Corneille,\r\nMolière, La Fontaine, and Boileau; and these great men were proud to\r\ncontribute the texts to which he set his music. He introduced female\r\ndancers into the ballet, disguised men having hitherto served in this\r\ncapacity, and in many essential ways was the father of early French\r\nopera, though its foundation had been laid by Cardinal Mazarin. He\r\nhad to fight against opposition and cabals, but his energy, tact, and\r\npersistence made him the victor, and won the friendship of the leading\r\nmen of his time. Such of his music as still exists is of a pleasing and\r\nmelodious character, full of vivacity and lire, and at times indicates\r\na more deep and serious power than that of merely creating catching\r\nand tuneful airs. He was the inventor of the operatic overture, and\r\nintroduced several new instruments into the orchestra. Apart from his\r\nsplendid administrative faculty, he is entitled to rank as an original\r\nand gifted, if not a great, composer.\r\n\r\nA lively sketch of the French opera of this period is given by Addison\r\nin No. 29 of the \"Spectator.\" \"The music of the French,\" he says, \"is\r\nindeed very properly adapted to their pronunciation and accent, as their\r\nwhole opera wonderfully favors the genius of such a gay, airy people.\r\nThe chorus in which that opera abounds gives the parterre frequent\r\nopportunities of joining in concert with the stage. This inclination of\r\nthe audience to sing along with the actors so prevails with them that\r\nI have sometimes known the performer on the stage to do no more in a\r\ncelebrated song than the clerk of a parish church, who serves only\r\nto raise the psalm, and is afterward drowned in the music of the\r\ncongregation. Every actor that comes on the stage is a beau. The queens\r\nand heroines are so painted that they appear as ruddy and cherry-cheeked\r\nas milkmaids. The shepherds are all embroidered, and acquit themselves\r\nin a ball better than our English dancing-masters. I have seen a couple\r\nof rivers appear in red stockings; and Alpheus, instead of having\r\nhis head covered with sedge and bulrushes, making love in a fair,\r\nfull-bottomed periwig, and a plume of feathers; but with a voice so\r\nfull of shakes and quavers, that I should have thought the murmur of a\r\ncountry brook the much more agreeable music. I remember the last opera\r\nI saw in that merry nation was the 'Rape of Proserpine,' where Pluto,\r\nto make the more tempting figure, puts himself in a French equipage, and\r\nbrings Ascalaphus along with him as his _valet de chambre_. This is what\r\nwe call folly and impertinence, but what the French look upon as gay and\r\npolite.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe French musical drama continued without much chance in the hands of\r\nthe Lulli school (for the musician had several skillful imitators and\r\nsuccessors) till the appearance of Jean Philippe Rameau, who inaugurated\r\na new era. This celebrated man was born in Auvergne in 1683, and was\r\nduring his earlier life the organist of the Clermont cathedral church.\r\nHere he pursued the scientific researches in music which entitled him\r\nin the eyes of his admirers to be called the Newton of his art. He had\r\nreached the age of fifty without recognition as a dramatic composer,\r\nwhen the production of \"Hippolyte et Aricie\" excited a violent feud\r\nby creating a strong current of opposition to the music of Lulli. He\r\nproduced works in rapid succession, and finally overcame all obstacles,\r\nand won for himself the name of being the greatest lyric composer which\r\nFrance up to that time had produced. His last opera, \"Les Paladins,\" was\r\ngiven in 1760, the composer being then seventy-seven.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of the art-feuds of that day, afterward shown in the\r\nGluck-Piccini contest, was foreshadowed in that waged by Rameau against\r\nLulli, and finally against the Italian newcomers, who sought to take\r\npossession of the French stage. The matter became a natioual quarrel,\r\nand it was considered an insult to France to prefer the music of an\r\nItalian to that of a Frenchman--an insult which was often settled by the\r\nrapier point, when tongue and pen had failed as arbitrators. The subject\r\nwas keenly debated by journalists and pamphleteers, and the press\r\ngroaned with essays to prove that Rameau was the first musician in\r\nEurope, though his works were utterly unknown outside of France. Perhaps\r\nno more valuable testimony to the character of these operas can be\r\nadduced than that of Baron Grimm:\r\n\r\n\"In his operas Rameau has overpowered all his predecessors by dint of\r\nharmony and quantity of notes. Some of his choruses are very fine.\r\nLulli could only sustain his vocal psalmody by a simple bass; Rameau\r\naccompanied almost all his recitatives with the orchestra. These\r\naccompaniments are generally in bad taste; they drown the voice rather\r\nthan support it, and force the singers to scream and howl in a manner\r\nwhich no ear of any delicacy can tolerate. We come away from an opera\r\nof Rameau's intoxicated with harmony and stupefied with the noise of\r\nvoice and instruments. His taste is always Gothic, and, whether his\r\nsubject is light or forcible, his style is equally heavy. He was not\r\ndestitute of ideas, but did not know what use to make of them. In his\r\nrecitatives the sound is continually in opposition to the sense, though\r\nthey occasionally contain happy declamatory passages.... If he had\r\nformed himself in some of the schools of Italy, and thus acquired a\r\nnotion of musical style and hahits of musical thought, he never would\r\nhave said (as he did) that all poems were alike to him, and that he\r\ncould set the 'Gazette de France' to music.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this it may be gathered that Rameau, though a scientific and\r\nlearned musician, lacked imagination, good taste, and dramatic\r\ninsight--qualities which in the modern lyric school of France have been\r\nso preeminent. It may be admitted, however, that he inspired a taste for\r\nsound musical science, and thus prepared the way for the great Gluck,\r\nwho to all and more of Rameau's musical knowledge united the grand\r\ngenius which makes him one of the giants of his art.\r\n\r\nThough Rameau enjoyed supremacy over the serious opera, a great\r\nexcitement was created in Paris by the arrival of an Italian company,\r\nwho in 1752 obtained permission to perform Italian burlettas and\r\nintermezzi at the opera-house. The partisans of the French school took\r\nalarm, and the admirers of Lulli and Rameau forgot their bickerings to\r\njoin forces against the foreign intruders. The battle-field was strewed\r\nwith floods of ink, and the literati pelted each other with ferocious\r\nlampoons.\r\n\r\nAmong the literature of this controversy, one pamphlet has an\r\nimperishable place, Rousseau's famous \"Lettre sur la Musique Française,\"\r\nin which the great sentimentalist espoused the cause of Italian music\r\nwith an eloquence and acrimony rarely surpassed. The inconsistency of\r\nthe author was as marked in this as in his private life. Not only did he\r\nat a later period become a great advocate of Gluck against Piocini,\r\nbut, in spite of his argument that it was impossible to compose music to\r\nFrench words, that the language was quite unfit for it, that the French\r\nnever had music and never would, he himself had composed a good deal\r\nof music to French words and produced a French opera, \"Le Devin du\r\nVillage.\" Diderot was also a warm partisan of the Italians. Pergolesi's\r\nbeautiful music having been murdered by the French orchestra players at\r\nthe Grand Opera-House, Diderot proposed for it the following witty and\r\nlaconic inscription: \"Hic Marsyas Apollinem.\"*\r\n\r\n     * Here Marsyas flayed Apollo.\r\n\r\nRousseau's opera, \"Le Devin du Village,\" was performed with considerable\r\nsuccess, in spite of the repugnance of the orchestral performers,\r\nof whom Rousseau always spoke in terms of unmeasured contempt, to do\r\njustice to the music. They burned Rousseau in effigy for his scoffs.\r\n\"Well,\" said the author of the \"Confessions,\" \"I don't wonder that they\r\nshould hang me now, after having so long put me to the torture.\"\r\n\r\nThe eloquence and abuse of the wits, however, did not long impair the\r\nsupremacy of Rameau; for the Italian company returned to their own\r\nland, disheartened by their reception in the French capital. Though this\r\ncomposer commenced so late in life, he left thirty-six dramatic works.\r\nHis greatest work was \"Castor et Pollux.\" Thirty years later Grimm\r\nrecognized its merits by admitting, in spite of the great faults of the\r\ncomposer, \"It is the pivot on which the glory of French music turns.\"\r\nWhen Louis XIV. offered Rameau a title, he answered, touching his breast\r\nand forehead, \"My nobility is here and here.\" This composer marked a\r\nstep forward in French music, for he gave it more boldness and freedom,\r\nand was the first really scientific and well-equipped exponent of\r\na national school. His choruses were full of energy and fire, his\r\norchestral effects rich and massive. He died in 1764, and the mortuary\r\nmusic, composed by himself, was performed by a double orchestra and\r\nchorus from the Grand Opera.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nA distinguished place in the records of French music must be assigned to\r\nAndré Ernest Grétry, born at Liege in 1741. His career covered the\r\nmost important changes in the art as colored and influenced by national\r\ntastes, and he is justly regarded as the father of comic opera in his\r\nadopted country. His childish life was one of much severe discipline and\r\ntribulation, for he was dedicated to music by his father, who was first\r\nviolinist in the college of St. Denis when he was only six years old. He\r\nafterward wrote of this time in his \"Essais sur la Musique\": \"The hour\r\nfor the lesson afforded the teacher an opportunity to exercise his\r\ncruelty. He made us sing each in turn, and woe to him who made the least\r\nmistake; he was beaten unmercifully, the youngest as well as the oldest.\r\nHe seemed to take pleasure in inventing torture. At times he would place\r\nus on a short round stick, from which we fell head over heels if we made\r\nthe least movement. But that which made us tremble with fear was to\r\nsee him knock down a pupil and beat him; for then we were sure he would\r\ntreat some others in the same manner, one victim being insufficient to\r\ngratify his ferocity. To maltreat his pupils was a sort of mania with\r\nhim; and he seemed to feel that his duty was performed in proportion to\r\nthe cries and sobs which he drew forth.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1759 Grétry went to Rome, where he studied counterpoint for five\r\nyears. Some of his works were received favorably by the Roman public,\r\nand he was made a member of the Philharmonic Society of Bologna. Pressed\r\nby pecuniary necessity, Grétry determined to go to Paris; but he stopped\r\nat Geneva on the route to earn money by singing-lessons. Here he met\r\nVoltaire at Ferney. \"You are a musician and have genius,\" said the great\r\nman; \"it is a very rare thing, and I take much interest in you.\" In\r\nspite of this, however, Voltaire would not write him the text for an\r\nopera. The philosopher of Ferney feared to trust his reputation with an\r\nunknown musician. When Grétry arrived in Paris he still found the same\r\ndifficulty, as no distinguished poet was disposed to give him a libretto\r\ntill he had made his powers recognized. After two years of starving and\r\nwaiting, Marmontel gave him the text of \"The Huron,\" which was brought\r\nout in 1769 and well received. Other successful works followed in rapid\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nAt this time Parisian frivolity thought it good taste to admire the\r\nrustic and naive. The idyls of Gessner and the pastorals of Florian\r\nwere the favorite reading, and Watteau the popular painter. Gentlefolks,\r\nsteeped in artifice, vice, and intrigue, masked their empty lives under\r\nthe as sumption of Arcadian simplicity, and minced and ambled in the\r\ncostumes of shepherds and shepherdesses. Marie Antoinette transformed\r\nher chalet of Petit Trianon into a farm, where she and her courtiers\r\nplayed at pastoral life--the farce preceding the tragedy of the\r\nRevolution. It was the effort of dazed society seeking change. Grétry\r\nfollowed the fashionable bent by composing pastoral comedies, and\r\nmounted on the wave of success.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 \"Fausse Magie\" was produced with the greatest applause. Rousseau\r\nwas present, and the composer waited on him in his box, meeting a most\r\ncordial reception. On their way home after the opera, Grétry offered\r\nhis new friend his arm to help him over an obstruction. Rousseau with\r\na burst of rage said, \"Let me make use of my own powers,\" and\r\nthenceforward the sentimental misanthrope refused to recognize the\r\ncomposer. About this time Grétry met the English humorist Hales, who\r\nafterward furnished him with many of his comic texts. The two combined\r\nto produce the \"Jugement de Midas,\" a satire on the old style of music,\r\nwhich met with remarkable popular favor, though it was not so well\r\nreceived by the court.\r\n\r\nThe crowning work of this composer's life was given to the world in\r\n1785. This was \"Richard Coeur de Lion,\" and it proved one of the great\r\nmusical events of the period. Paris was in ecstasies, and the judgment\r\nof succeeding generations has confirmed the contemporary verdict, as\r\nit is still a favorite opera in France and Germany. The works afterward\r\ncomposed by Grétry showed decadence in power. Singularly rich in fresh\r\nand sprightly ideas, he lacked depth and grandeur, and failed to suit\r\nthe deeper and sounder taste which Cherubini and Méhul, great followers\r\nin the footsteps of Gluck, gratified by a series of noble masterpieces.\r\nGrétry's services to his art, however, by his production of comic\r\noperas full of lyric vivacity and sparkle, have never been forgotten nor\r\nunderrated. His bust was placed in the opera-house during his lifetime,\r\nand he was made a member of the French Academy of Fine Arts and\r\nInspector of the Conservatory. Grétry possessed qualities of heart which\r\nendeared him to all, and his death in 1813 was the occasion of a\r\ngeneral outburst of lamentation. Deputations from the theatres and\r\nthe Conservatory accompanied his remains to the cemetery, where Méhul\r\npronounced an eloquent eulogium. In 1828 a nephew of Grétry caused the\r\nheart of him who was one of the glorious sons of Liege to be returned to\r\nhis native city.\r\n\r\nGrétry founded a school of musical composition in France which has since\r\nbeen cultivated with signal success, that of lyric comedy. The efforts\r\nof Lulli and Rameau had been turned in another direction. The former had\r\ndone little more than set courtly pageants to music, though he had\r\ndone this with great skill and tact, enriching them with a variety\r\nof concerted and orchestral pieces, and showing much fertility in the\r\ninvention alike of pathetic and lively melodies. Rameau followed in the\r\nfootsteps of Lulli, but expanded and crystallized his ideas into a more\r\nscientific form. He had indeed carried his love of form to a radical\r\nextreme. Jean Jacques Rousseau, who extended his taste for nature and\r\nsimplicity to music, blamed him severely as one who neglected genuine\r\nnatural tune for far-fetched harmonies, on the ground that \"music is a\r\nchild of nature, and has a language of its own for expressing emotional\r\ntransports, which can not be learned from thorough bass rules.\" Again\r\nRousseau, in his forcible tract on French music, says of Rameau, from\r\nwhose school Grétry's music was such a significant departure:\r\n\r\n\"One must confess that M. Rameau possesses very great talent, much fire\r\nand euphony, and a considerable knowledge of harmonious combinations and\r\neffects; one must also grant him the art of appropriating the ideas of\r\nothers by changing their character, adorning and developing them, and\r\nturning them around in all manner of ways, On the other hand, he shows\r\nless facility in inventing new ones. Altogether he has more skill than\r\nfertility, more knowledge than genius, or rather genius smothered\r\nby knowledge, but always force, grace, and very often a beautiful\r\n_cantileana_. His recitative is not as natural but much more varied than\r\nthat of Lulli; admirable in a few scenes, but bad as a rule.\" Rousseau\r\ncontinues to reproach Rameau with a too powerful instrumentation,\r\ncompared with Italian simplicity, and sums up that nobody knew better\r\nthan Rameau how to conceive the spirit of single passages and to produce\r\nartistic contrasts, but that he entirely failed to give his operas\r\n\"a happy and much-to-be-desired unity.\" In another part of the quoted\r\npassage Rousseau says that Rameau stands far beneath Lulli in _esprit_\r\nand artistic tact, but that he is often superior to him in dramatic\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nA clear understanding of the musical position of Rameau is necessary to\r\nfully appreciate the place of Grétry, his antithesis as a composer.\r\nFor a short time the popularity of Rameau had been shaken by an Italian\r\nopera company, called by the French _Les Bouffons_, who had created a\r\ngenuine sensation by their performance of airy and sparkling operettas,\r\nentirely removed in spirit from the ponderous productions of the\r\nprevailing school. Though the Italian comedians did not meet with\r\npermanent success, the suave charm of their music left behind it\r\nmemories which became fruitful.*\r\n\r\n     * In its infancy Italian comic opera formed the _intermezzo_\r\n     between the acts of a serious opera, and--similar to the\r\n     Greek sylvan drama which followed the tragic trilogy--was\r\n     frequently a parody on the piece which preceded it; though\r\n     more frequently still (as in Pergolcsi's \"Serra Padrona\") it\r\n     was not a satire on any particular subject, but designed to\r\n     heighten the ideal artistic effect of the serious opera by\r\n     broad comedy. Having acquired a complete form on the boards\r\n     of the small theatres, it was transferred to the larger\r\n     stage. Though it lacked the external splendor and consummate\r\n     vocalization of the elder sister, its simpler forms endowed\r\n     it with a more characteristic rendering of actual life.\r\n\r\nIt furnished the point of departure for the lively and facile genius\r\nof Grétry, who laid the foundation stones of that lyric comedywhich has\r\nflourished in France with so much luxuriance. From the outset merriment\r\nand humor were by no means the sole object of the French comic opera,\r\nas in the case of its Italian sister. Grétry did not neglect to turn the\r\nnobler emotions to account, and by a judicious admixture of sentiment\r\nhe gave an ideal coloring to his works, which made them singularly\r\nfascinating and original. Around Grétry flourished several disciples and\r\nimitators, and for twenty years this charming hybrid between opera and\r\nvaudeville engrossed French musical talent, to the exclusion of other\r\nforms of composition. It was only when Gluck * appeared on the scene,\r\nand by his commanding genius restored serious opera to its supremacy,\r\nthat Grotry's repute was overshadowed. From this decline in public\r\nfavor he never fully recovered, for the master left behind him gifted\r\ndisciples, who embodied his traditions, and were inspired by his lofty\r\naims--preeminently so in the case of Cherubini, perhaps the greatest\r\nname in French music. While French comic opera, since the days of\r\nGrétry, has become modified in some of its forms, it preserves the\r\nspirit and coloring which he so happily imparted to it, and looks back\r\nto him as its founder and lawgiver.\r\n\r\n     *See article on \"Gluck,\" in \"The Great German Composers\"\r\n     (a companion volume to this), in which his connection with\r\n     French music is discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nOne of the most accomplished of historians and critics, Oulibischeff,\r\nsums up the place of Cherubini in musical art in these words: \"If on the\r\none hand Gluck's calm and plastic grandeur, and on the other the tender\r\nand voluptuous charm of the melodies of Piccini and Zacchini, had suited\r\nthe circumstances of a state of society sunk in luxury and nourished\r\nwith classical exhibitions, this could not satisfy a society shaken to\r\nthe very foundations of its faith and organization. The whole of the\r\ndramatic music of the eighteenth century must naturally have appeared\r\ncold and languid to men whose minds were profoundly moved with troubles\r\nand wars; and even at the present day the word languor best expresses\r\nthat which no longer touches us in the operas of the last century,\r\nwithout even excepting those of Mozart himself. What we require for the\r\npictures of dramatic music is larger frames, including more figures,\r\nmore passionate and moving song, more sharply marked rhythms, greater\r\nfullness in the vocal masses, and more sonorous brilliancy in the\r\ninstrumentation. All these qualities are to be found in 'Lodoi'ska'\r\nand 'Les Deux Journées'; and Cherubini may not only be regarded as the\r\nfounder of the modern French opera, but also as that musician who, after\r\nMozart, has exerted the greatest general influence on the tendency of\r\nthe art. An Italian by birth and the excellence of his education, which\r\nwas conducted by Sarti, the great teacher of composition; a German by\r\nhis musical sympathies as well as by the variety and profundity of his\r\nknowledge; and a Frenchman by the school and principles to which we\r\nowe his finest dramatic works, Cherubini strikes me as being the most\r\naccomplished musician, if not the greatest genius, of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the English composer Macfarren observes: \"Cherubini's position\r\nis unique in the history of his art; actively before the world as\r\na composer for threescore years and ten, his career spans over more\r\nvicissitudes in the progress of music than that of any other man.\r\nBeginning to write in the same year with Cimarosa, and even earlier than\r\nMozart, and being the contemporary of Verdi and Wagner, he witnessed\r\nalmost the origin of the two modern classical schools of France and\r\nGermany, their rise to perfection, and, if not their decline, the\r\narrival of a time when criticism would usurp the place of creation, and\r\nwhen to propound new rules for art claims higher consideration than\r\nto act according to its ever unalterable principles. His artistic life\r\nindeed was a rainbow based on the two extremes of modern music which\r\nshed light and glory on the great art-cycle over which it arched....\r\nHis excellence consists in his unswerving earnestness of purpose, in\r\nthe individuality of his manner, in the vigor of his ideas, and in the\r\npurity of his harmony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such,\" says M. Miel, \"was Cherubim; a colossal and incommensurable\r\ngenius, an existence full of days, of masterpieces, and of glory.\r\nAmong his rivals he found his most sincere appreciators. The Chevalier\r\nSeyfried has recorded, in a notice on Beethoven, that that grand\r\nmusician regarded Cherubini as the first of his contemporary composers.\r\nWe will add nothing to this praise: the judgment of such a rival is, for\r\nCherubini, the voice itself of posterity.\"\r\n\r\nLuigi Carlo Zanobe Salvadore Maria Cherubini was born at Florence on\r\nSeptember 14, 1700, the son of a harpsichord accompanyist at the Pergola\r\nTheatre. Like so many other great composers, young Cherubini displayed\r\nsigns of a fertile and powerful genius at an early age, mastering the\r\ndifficulties of music as if by instinct. At the age of nine he was\r\nplaced under the charge of Felici, one of the best Tuscan professors of\r\nthe day; and four years afterward he composed his first work, a mass.\r\nHis creative instinct, thus awakened, remained active, and he produced\r\na series of compositions which awakened no little admiration, so that he\r\nwas pointed at in the streets of Florence as the young prodigy. When he\r\nwas about sixteen the attention of the Grand Duke Leopold of Tuscany was\r\ndirected to him, and through that prince's liberality he was enabled\r\nto become a pupil of the most celebrated Italian master of the age,\r\nGiuseppe Sarti, of whom he soon became the favorite pupil. Under the\r\ndirection of Sarti, the young composer produced a series of operas,\r\nsonatas, and masses, and wrote much of the music which appeared under\r\nthe maestro's own name--a practice then common in the music and painting\r\nschools of Italy. At the age of nineteen Cherubini was recognized as\r\none of the most learned and accomplished musicians of the age, and his\r\nservices were in active demand at the Italian theatres. In four years\r\nhe produced thirteen operas, the names and character of which it is not\r\nnecessary now to mention, as they are unknown except to the antiquary\r\nwhose zeal prompts him to defy the dust of the Italian theatrical\r\nlibraries. Halévy, whose admiration of his master led him to study these\r\nearly compositions, speaks of them as full of striking beauties, and,\r\nthough crude in many particulars, distinguished by those virile and\r\ndaring conceptions which from the outset stamped the originality of the\r\nman.\r\n\r\nCherubini passed through Paris in 1784, while the Gluck-Piccini\r\nexcitement was yet warm, and visited London as composer for the Royal\r\nItalian Opera. Here he became a constant visitor in courtly circles, and\r\nthe Prince of Wales, the Duke of Queensbury, and other noble amateurs,\r\nconceived the warmest admiration for his character and abilities. For\r\nsome reason, however, his operas written for England failed, and\r\nhe quitted England in 1786, intending to return to Italy. But the\r\nfascinations of Paris held him, as they have done so many others,\r\nnoticeably so among the great musicians; and what was designed as a\r\nflying visit became a life-long residence, with the exception of brief\r\ninterruptions in Germany and Italy, whither he went to fill professional\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\nCherubini took up his residence with his friend Viotti, who introduced\r\nhim to the Queen, Marie Antoinette, and the highest society of the\r\ncapital, then as now the art-center of the world. He became an intimate\r\nof the brilliant salons of Mme. de Polignac, Mme. d'Etiolés, Mme. de\r\nRichelieu, and of the various bright assemblies where the wit, rank, and\r\nbeauty of Paris gathered in the days just prior to the Revolution. The\r\npoet Marmontel became his intimate friend, and gave him the opera story\r\nof \"Demophon\" to set to music. It was at this period that Cherubini\r\nbecame acquainted with the works of Haydn, and learned from him how to\r\nunite depth with lightness, grace with power, jest with earnestness, and\r\ntoying with dignity.\r\n\r\nA short visit to Italy for the carnival of 1788 resulted in the\r\nproduction of the opera of \"Ifigenia in Aulide\" at La Scala, Milan.\r\nThe success was great, and this work, the last written for his native\r\ncountry, was given also at Florence and Parma with no less delight and\r\napprobation on the part of the public. Had Cherubini died at this time,\r\nhe would have left nothing but an obscure name for Fétis's immense\r\ndictionary. Unlike Mozart and Schubert, who at the same age had reached\r\ntheir highest development, this robust and massive genius ripened\r\nslowly. With him as with Gluck, with whom he had so many affinities,\r\na short life would have been fatal to renown. His last opera showed a\r\nturning point in his development. Halévy, his great disciple, speaks of\r\nthis period as follows: \"He is already more nervous; there peeps out\r\nI know not exactly how much of force and virility of which the Italian\r\nmusicians of his day did not know or did not seek the secret. It is the\r\ndawn of a new day. Cherubini was preparing himself for the combat. Gluck\r\nhad accustomed France to the sublime energy of his masterpieces. Mozart\r\nhad just written 'Le Nozze di Figaro' and 'Don Giovanni.' He must not\r\nlag behind. He must not be conquered. In that career which he was about\r\nto dare to enter, he met two giants. Like the athlete who descends into\r\nthe arena, he anointed his limbs and girded his loins for the fight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nMarmontel had furnished the libretto of an opera to Cherubini, and the\r\ncomposer shortly after his return from Turin to Paris had it produced at\r\nthe Royal Academy of Music. Vogel's opera on the same text, \"Demophon,\"\r\nwas also brought out, but neither one met with great success.\r\nCherubini's work, though full of vigor and force, wanted color and\r\ndramatic point. He was disgusted with his failure, and resolved\r\nto eschew dramatic music; so for the nonce he devoted himself to\r\ninstrumental music and cantata. Two works of the latter class, \"Amphion\"\r\nand \"Circe,\" composed at this time, were of such excellence as to retain\r\na permanent hold on the French stage. Cherubini, too, became director of\r\nthe Italian opera troupe, \"Les Bouffons,\" organized under the patronage\r\nof Léonard, the Queen's performer, and exercised his taste for\r\ncomposition by interpolating airs of his own into the works of the\r\nItalian composers, which were then interesting the French public as\r\nagainst the operas of Rameau.\r\n\r\n\"At this time,\" we are told by Laf age, \"Cherubini had two distinct\r\nstyles, one of which was allied to Paisiello and Cimarosa by the grace,\r\nelegance, and purity of the melodic forms; the other, which attached\r\nitself to the school of Gluck and Mozart, more harmonic than melodious,\r\nrich in instrumental details.\" This manner was the then unappreciated\r\ntype of a new school destined to change the forms of musical art.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 the Revolution broke out and rent the established order\r\nof things into fragments. For a time all the interests of art were\r\nswallowed up in the frightful turmoil which made Paris the center of\r\nattention for astonished and alarmed Europe. Cherubini's connection had\r\nbeen with the aristocracy, and now they were fleeing in a mad panic or\r\nmounting the scaffold. His livelihood became precarious, and he suffered\r\nseverely during the first five years of anarchy. His seclusion was\r\npassed in studying music, the physical sciences, drawing, and botany;\r\nand his acquaintance was wisely confined to a few musicians like\r\nhimself. Once, indeed, his having learned the violin as a child was the\r\nmeans of saving his life. Independently venturing out at night, he was\r\narrested by a roving band of drunken _Sansculottes_, who were seeking\r\nmusicians to conduct their street chants. Somebody recognized Cherubini\r\nas a favorite of court circles, and, when he refused to lead their\r\nobscene music, the fatal cry, \"The Royalist, the Royalist!\" buzzed\r\nthrough the crowd. At this critical moment another kidnapped player\r\nthrust a violin in Cherubini's hands and persuaded him to yield. So\r\nthe two musicians marched all day amid the hoarse yells of the drunken\r\nrevolutionists. He was also enrolled in the National Guard, and obliged\r\nto accompany daily the march of the unfortunate throngs who shed their\r\nblood under the axe of the guillotine. Cherubini would have fled from\r\nthese horrible surroundings, but it was difficult to evade the vigilance\r\nof the French officials; he had no money; and he would not leave the\r\nbeautiful Cécile Tourette, to whom he was affianced.\r\n\r\nOne of the theatres opened during the revolutionary epoch was the\r\nThéâtre Feydeau. The second opera performed was Cherubini's \"Lodoïska\"\r\n(1791), at which he had been laboring for a long time, and which was\r\nreceived throughout Europe with the greatest enthusiasm and delight, not\r\nless in Germany than in France and Italy. The stirring times aroused a\r\nnew taste in music, as well as in politics and literature. The dramas of\r\nRacine and the operas of Lulli were akin. No less did the stormy\r\ngenius of Schiller find its counterpart in Beethoven and Cherubini. The\r\nproduction of \"Lodoïska\" was the point of departure from which the great\r\nFrench school of serious opera, which has given us \"Robert le Diable,\"\r\n\"Les Huguenots,\" and \"Faust,\" got its primal value and significance. Two\r\nmen of genius, Gluck and Grétry, had formed the taste of the public in\r\nbeing faithful to the accents of nature. The idea of reconciling this\r\ntaste, founded on strict truth, with the seductive charm of the Italian\r\nforms, to which the French were beginning to be sensible, suggested to\r\nCherubini a system of lyric drama capable of satisfying both. Wagner\r\nhimself even says, in his \"Tendencies and Theories,\" speaking of\r\nCherubini and his great co-laborers Méhul and Spontini: \"It would be\r\ndifficult to answer them, if they now perchance came among us and asked\r\nin what respect we had improved on their mode of musical procedure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lodoïska,\" which cast the old Italian operas into permanent oblivion,\r\nand laid the foundation of the modern French dramatic school in music,\r\nhas a libretto similar to that of \"Fidelio\" and Grétry's \"Coeur de Lion\"\r\ncombined, and was taken from a romance of Faiblas by Fillette Loraux.\r\nThe critics found only one objection: the music was all so beautiful\r\nthat no breathing time was granted the listener. In one year the opera\r\nwas performed two hundred times, and at short intervals two hundred more\r\nrepresentations took place.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution culminated in the crisis of 1793, which sent the King to\r\nthe scaffold. Cherubini found a retreat at La Chartreuse, near Rouen,\r\nthe country seat of his friend, the architect Louis. Here he lived in\r\ntranquillity, and composed several minor pieces and a three-act opera,\r\nnever produced, but afterward worked over into \"Ali Baba\" and \"Faniska.\"\r\nIn his Norman retreat Cherubini heard of the death of his father, and\r\nwhile suffering under this infliction, just before his return to Paris\r\nin 1794, he composed the opera of \"Elisa.\" This work wras received\r\nwith much favor at the Feydeau theatre, though it did not arouse the\r\nadmiration called out by \"Lodoïska.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1795 the Paris Conservatory was founded, and Cherubini appointed\r\none of the five inspectors, as well as professor of counterpoint, his\r\nassociates being Lesueur, Grétry, Gossec, and Méhul. The same year\r\nalso saw him united to Cécile Tourette, to whom he had been so long and\r\ndevotedly attached. Absorbed in his duties at the Conservatory he\r\ndid not come before the public again till 1797, when the great tragic\r\nmasterpiece of \"Médée\" was produced at the Feydeau theatre. \"Lodoïska\"\r\nhad been somewhat gay; \"Elisa,\" a work of graver import, followed;\r\nbut in \"Médée\" was attained the profound tragic power of Gluck and\r\nBeethoven. Hoffman's libretto was indeed unworthy of the great music,\r\nbut this has not prevented its recognition by musicians as one of the\r\nnoblest operas ever written. It has probably been one of the causes,\r\nhowever, why it is so rarely represented at the present time, its\r\noverture alone being well known to modern musical audiences. This opera\r\nhas been compared by critics to Shakespeare's \"King Lear,\" as being a\r\ngreat expression of anguish and despair in their more stormy phases.\r\nChorley tells us that, when he first saw it, he was irresistibly\r\nreminded of the lines in Barry Cornwall's poem to Pasta:\r\n\r\n     \"Now thou art like some winged thing that cries\r\n     Above some city, flaming fast to death.\"\r\n\r\nThe poem which Chorley quotes from was inspired by the performance of\r\nthe great Pasta in Simone Mayer's weak musical setting of the fable of\r\nthe Colchian sorceress, which crowded the opera-houses of Europe. The\r\nlife of the French classical tragedy, too, was powerfully assisted by\r\nRachel. Though the poem on which Cherubini worked was unworthy of his\r\ngenius, it could not be from this or from lack of interest in the theme\r\nalone that this great work is so rarely performed; it is because there\r\nhave been not more than three or four actresses in the last hundred\r\nyears combining the great tragic and vocal requirements exacted by the\r\npart. If the tragic genius of Pasta conld have been united with the\r\nvoice of a Catalani, made as it were of adamant and gold, Cherubini's\r\nsublime musical creation would have found an adequate interpreter.\r\nMdlle. Tietjens, indeed, has been the only late dramatic singer who\r\ndared essay so difficult a task. Musical students rank the instrumental\r\nparts of this opera with the organ music of Bach, the choral fugues\r\nof Handel, and the symphonies of Beethoven, for beauty of form and\r\noriginality of ideas.\r\n\r\nOn its first representation, on the 13th of March, 1797, one of the\r\njournals, after praising its beauty, professed to discover imitations\r\nof Méhul's manner in it. The latter composer, in an indignant rejoinder,\r\nproclaimed himself and all others as overshadowed by Cherubini's genius:\r\na singular example of artistic humility and justice. Three years after\r\nits performance in Paris, it was given at Berlin and Vienna, and stamped\r\nby the Germans as one of the world's great musical masterpieces. This\r\nwork was a favorite one with Schubert, Beethoven, and Weber, and\r\nthere have been few great composers who have not put on record their\r\nadmiration of it.\r\n\r\nAs great, however, as \"Médée\" is ranked, \"Les Deux Journées,\"* produced\r\nin 1800, is the opera on which Cherubim's fame as a dramatic composer\r\nchiefly rests.\r\n\r\n     * In German known as \"Die Wassertràger,\" in English \"The\r\n     Water-Carriers.\"\r\n\r\nThree hundred consecutive performances did not satisfy Paris; and\r\nat Berlin and Frankfort, as well as in Italy, it was hailed with\r\nacclamation. Bouilly was the author of the opera-story, suggested by the\r\ngenerous action of a water-carrier toward a magistrate who was related\r\nto the author. The story is so interesting, so admirably written, that\r\nGoethe and Mendelssohn considered it the true model for a comic opera.\r\nThe musical composition, too, is nearly faultless in form and replete\r\nwith beauties. In this opera Cherubini anticipated the reforms of\r\nWagner, for he dispensed with the old system which made the drama a web\r\nof beautiful melodies, and established his musical effects for the most\r\npart by the vigor and charm of the choruses and concerted pieces. It\r\nhas been accepted as a model work by composers, and Beethoven was in the\r\nhabit of keeping it by him on his writing-table for constant study and\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nSpohr in his autobiography says: \"I recollect, when the 'Deux Journées'\r\nwas performed for the first time, how, intoxicated with delight and\r\nthe powerful impression the work had made on me, I asked on that very\r\nevening to have the score given me, and sat over it the whole night;\r\nand that it was that opera chiefly that gave me my first impulse to\r\ncomposition.\" Weber, in a letter from Munich written in 1812, says:\r\n\"Fancy my delight when I beheld lying upon the table of the hotel the\r\nplay-bill with the magic name _Armand_. I was the first person in the\r\ntheatre, and planted myself in the middle of the pit, where I waited\r\nmost anxiously for the tones which I knew beforehand would elevate and\r\ninspire me. I think I may assert boldly that 'Les Deux Journées' is a\r\nreally great dramatic and classical work. Everything is calculated so\r\nas to produce the greatest effect; all the various pieces are so much in\r\ntheir proper place that you can neither omit one nor make any addition\r\nto them. The opera displays a pleasing richness of melody, vigorous\r\ndeclamation, and all-striking truth in the treatment of situations, ever\r\nnew, ever heard and retained with pleasure.\" Mendelssohn, too, writing\r\nto his father of a performance of this opera, speaks of the enthusiasm\r\nof the audience as extreme, as well as of his own pleasure as surpassing\r\nanything he had ever experienced in a theatre. Mendelssohn, who never\r\ncompleted an opera, because he did not find until shortly before\r\nhis death a theme which properly inspired him to dramatic creation,\r\ncorresponded with Planché, with the hope of getting from the latter a\r\nlibretto which should unite the excellences of \"Fidelio\" with those of\r\n\"Les Deux Journées.\" He found, at last, a libretto, which, if it did not\r\nwholly satisfy him, at least overcame some of his prejudices, in a story\r\nbased on the Rhine myth of Lorelei. A fragment of it only was finished,\r\nand the finale of the first act is occasionally performed in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nBefore Napoleon became First Consul, he had been on familiar terms with\r\nCherubini. The soldier and the composer were seated in the same box\r\nlistening to an opera by the latter. Napoleon, whose tastes for music\r\nwere for the suave and sensuous Italian style, turned to him and said:\r\n\"My dear Cherubini, you are certainly an excellent musician; but really\r\nyour music is so noisy and complicated that I can make nothing of it;\"\r\nto which Cherubini replied: \"My dear general, you are certainly an\r\nexcellent soldier; but in regard to music you must excuse me if I\r\ndon't think it necessary to adapt my music to your comprehension.\" This\r\nhaughty reply was the beginning of an estrangement. Another illustration\r\nof Cherubini's sturdy pride and dignity was his rejoinder to Napoleon,\r\nwhen the latter was praising the works of the Italian composers, and\r\ncovertly sneering at his own. \"Citizen General,\" he replied, \"occupy\r\nyourself with battles and victories, and allow me to treat according to\r\nmy talent an art of which you are grossly ignorant.\" Even when Napoleon\r\nbecame Emperor, the proud composer never learned \"to crook the pregnant\r\nhinges of his knee\" to the man before whom Europe trembled.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of December, 1800, a grand performance of \"The Creation\"\r\ntook place at Paris. Napoleon on his way to it narrowly escaped being\r\nkilled by an infernal machine. Cherubini was one of the deputation,\r\nrepresenting the various corporations and societies of Paris, who waited\r\non the First Consul to congratulate him upon his escape. Cherubini kept\r\nin the background, when the sarcasm, \"I do not see Monsieur Cherubini,\"\r\npronounced in the French way, as if to indicate that Cherubini was not\r\nworthy of being ranked with the Italian composers, brought him promptly\r\nforward. \"Well,\" said Napoleon, \"the French are in Italy.\" \"Where would\r\nthey not go,\" answered Cherubini, \"led by such a hero as you?\" This\r\npleased the First Consul, who, however, soon got to the old musical\r\nquarrel. \"I tell you I like Paisiello's music immensely; it is soft and\r\ntranquil. You have much talent, but there is too much accompaniment.\"\r\nSaid Cherubini, \"Citizen Consul, I conform myself to French taste.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your music,\" continued the other, \"makes too much noise. Speak to me\r\nin that of Paisiello; that is what lulls me gently.\" \"I understand,\"\r\nreplied the composer; \"you like music which doesn't stop you from\r\nthinking of state affairs.\" This witty rejoinder made the arrogant\r\nsoldier frown, and the talk suddenly ceased.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this alienation Cherubini found himself persistently\r\nignored and ill-treated by the First Consul. In spite of his having\r\nproduced such great masterpieces, his income was very small, apart from\r\nhis pay as Inspector of the Conservatory. The ill will of the ruler of\r\nFrance was a steady check to his preferment. When Napoleon established\r\nhis consular chapel in 1802, he invited Paisiello from Naples to become\r\ndirector at a salary of 12,000 francs a year. It gave great umbrage to\r\nthe Conservatory that its famous teachers should have been slighted for\r\nan Italian foreigner, and musical circles in Paris were shaken by petty\r\ncontentions. Paisiello, however, found the public indifferent to his\r\nworks, and soon wearied of a place where the admiration to which he had\r\nbeen accustomed no longer flattered his complacency. He resigned, and\r\nhis position was offered to Méhul, who is said to have declined it\r\nbecause he regarded Cherubini as far more worthy of it, and to have\r\naccepted it only on condition that his friend could share the duties and\r\nemoluments with him. Cherubini, fretted and irritated by his condition,\r\nretired for a time from the pursuit of his art, and devoted himself to\r\nflowers. The opera of \"Anacreon,\" a powerful but unequal work, which\r\nreflected the disturbance and agitation of his mind, was the sole fruit\r\nof his musical efforts for about four years.\r\n\r\nWhile Cherubini was in the deepest depression--for he had a large\r\nfamily depending on him and small means with which to support them--a\r\nray of sunshine came in 1805 in the shape of an invitation to compose\r\nfor the managers of the opera at Vienna. His advent at the Austrian\r\ncapital produced a profound sensation, and he received a right royal\r\nwelcome from the great musicians of Germany. The aged Haydn, Hummel,\r\nand Beethoven became his warm friends with the generous freemasonry of\r\ngenius, for his rank as a musician was recognized throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe war which broke out after our musician's departure from Paris\r\nbetween France and Austria ended shortly in the capitulation of Ulm,\r\nand the French Emperor took up his residence at Schônbrunn. Napoleon\r\nreceived Cherubini kindly when he came in answer to his summons, and\r\nit was arranged that a series of twelve concerts should be given\r\nalternately at Schonbrunn and Vienna. The pettiness which entered into\r\nthe French Emperor's nature in spite of his greatness continued to be\r\nshown in his ebullitions of wrath because Cherubini persisted in holding\r\nhis own musical views against the imperial opinion. Napoleon, however,\r\non the eve of his return to France, urged him to accompany him, offering\r\nthe long-coveted position of musical director; but Cherubini was under\r\ncontract to remain a certain length of time at Vienna, and he would not\r\nbreak his pledge.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1805 witnessed two remarkable musical events at the\r\nAustrian capital, the production of Beethoven's \"Fidelio\" and the last\r\ngreat opera written by Cherubini, \"Faniska.\" Haydn and Beethoven were\r\nboth present at the latter performance. The former embraced Cherubini\r\nand said to him, \"You are my son, worthy of my love.\" Beethoven\r\ncordially hailed him as \"the first dramatic composer of the age.\" It is\r\nan interesting fact that two such important dramatic compositions should\r\nhave been written at the same time, independently of each other; that\r\nboth works should have been in advance of their age; that they should\r\nhave displayed a striking similarity of style; and that both should\r\nhave suffered from the reproach of the music being too learned for the\r\npublic. The opera of \"Faniska\" is based on a Polish legend of great\r\ndramatic beauty, which, however, was not very artistically treated\r\nby the librettist. Mendelssohn in after years noted the striking\r\nresemblance between Beethoven and our composer in the conception\r\nand method of dramatic composition. In one of his letters to Edouard\r\nDevrient he says, speaking of \"Fidelio\": \"On looking into the score,\r\nas well as on listening to the performance, I everywhere perceive\r\nCherubim's dramatic style of composition. It is true that Beethoven did\r\nnot ape that style, but it was before his mind as his most cherished\r\npattern.\" The unity of idea and musical color between \"Faniska\" and\r\n\"Fidelio\" seems to have been noted by many critics both of contemporary\r\nand succeeding times.\r\n\r\nCherubini would gladly have written more for the Viennese, by whom\r\nhe had been so cordially treated; but the unsettled times and his\r\nhomesickness for Paris conspired to take him back to the city of his\r\nadoption. He exhausted many efforts to find Mozart's tomb in Vienna, and\r\ndesired to place a monument over his neglected remains, but failed to\r\nlocate the resting-place of one he loved so much. Haydn, Beethoven,\r\nHummel, Salieri, and the other leading composers reluctantly parted\r\nwith him, and on April 1, 1806, his return to Paris was celebrated by\r\na brilliant fête improvised for him at the Conservatory. Fate, however,\r\nhad not done with her persecutions, for fate in France took the shape of\r\nNapoleon, whose hostility, easily aroused, was implacable; who aspired\r\nto rule the arts and letters as he did armies and state policy; who\r\nspared neither Cherubini nor Madame de Staël. Cherubini was neglected\r\nand insulted by authority, while honors were showered on Méhul, Grétry,\r\nSpontini, and Lesueur. He sank into a state of profound depression, and\r\nit was even reported in Vienna that he was dead. He forsook music and\r\ndevoted himself to drawing and botany. Had he not been a great musician,\r\nit is probable he would have excelled in pictorial art. One day the\r\ngreat painter David entered the room where he was working in crayon on a\r\nlandscape of the Salvator Rosa style. So pleased was the painter that he\r\ncried, \"Truly admirable! Courage!\" In 1808 Cherubini found complete\r\nrest in a visit to the country-seat of the Prince de Chimay in Belgium,\r\nwhither he was accompanied by his friend and pupil Auber.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nWith this period Cherubini closed his career practically as an operatic\r\ncomposer, though several dramatic works were produced subsequently, and\r\nentered on his no less great sphere of ecclesiastical composition.\r\nAt Chimay for a while no one dared to mention music in his presence.\r\nDrawing and painting flowers seemed to be his sole pleasure. At last the\r\npresident of the little music society at Chimay ventured to ask him to\r\nwrite a mass for St. Cecilia's feast day. He curtly refused, but\r\nhis hostess noticed that he was agitated by the incident,'as if his\r\nslumbering instincts had started again into life. One day the Princess\r\nplaced music paper on his table, and Cherubini on returning from his\r\nwalk instantly began to compose, as if he had never ceased it. It is\r\nrecorded that he traced out in full score the \"Kyrie\" of his great\r\nmass in F during the intermission of a single game of billiards. Only\r\na portion of the mass was completed in time for the festival, but,\r\non Cherubini's return to Paris in 1809, it was publicly given by an\r\nadmirable orchestra, and hailed with a great enthusiasm, that soon\r\nswept through Europe. It was perceived that Cherubini had struck out\r\nfor himself a new path in church music. Fétis, the musical historian,\r\nrecords its reception as follows: \"All expressed an unreserved\r\nadmiration for this composition of a new order, whereby Cherubini\r\nhas placed himself above all musicians who have as yet written in\r\nthe concerted style of church music. Superior to the masses of Haydn,\r\nMozart, and Beethoven, and the masters of the Neapolitan school, that of\r\nCherubini is as remarkable for originality of idea as for perfection in\r\nart.\" Picchiante, a distinguished critic, sums up the impressions made\r\nby this great work in the following eloquent and vigorous passage: \"All\r\nthe musical science of the good age of religious music, the sixteenth\r\ncentury of the Christian era, was summed up in Palestrina, who\r\nflourished at that time, and by its aid he put into form noble and\r\nsublime conceptions. With the grave Gregorian melody, learnedly\r\nelaborated in vigorous counterpoint and reduced to greater clearness and\r\nelegance without instrumental aid, Palestrina knew how to awaken among\r\nhis hearers mysterious, grand, deep, vague sensations, that seemed\r\ncaused by the objects of an unknown world, or by superior powers in\r\nthe human imagination. With the same profound thoughtfulness of the old\r\nCatholic music, enriched by the perfection which art has attained in two\r\ncenturies, and with all the means which a composer nowadays can make\r\nuse of, Cherubini perfected another conception, and this consisted in\r\nutilizing the style adapted to dramatic composition when narrating the\r\nchurch text, by which means he was able to succeed in depicting man in\r\nhis various vicissitudes, now rising to the praises of Divinity, now\r\ngazing on the Supreme Power, now suppliant and prostrate. So that, while\r\nPalestrina's music places God before man, that of Cherubini places man\r\nbefore God.\" Adolphe Adam puts the comparison more epigrammatically in\r\nsaying: \"If Palestrina had lived in our own times, he would have been\r\nCherubini.\" The masters of the old Roman school of church music had\r\nreceived it as an emanation of pure sentiment, with no tinge of human\r\nwarmth and color. Cherubini, on the contrary, aimed to make his music\r\nexpress the dramatic passion of the words, and in the realization of\r\nthis he brought to bear all the resources of a musical science unequaled\r\nexcept perhaps by Beethoven. The noble masses in F and D were also\r\nwritten in 1809 and stamped themselves on public judgment as no less\r\npowerful works of genius and knowledge.\r\n\r\nSome of Cherubini's friends in 1809 tried to reconcile the composer\r\nwith the Emperor, and in furtherance of this an opera was written\r\nanonymously, \"Pimmalione.\" Napoleon was delighted, and even affected to\r\ntears. Instantly, however, that Cherubini's name was uttered, he became\r\ndumb and cold. Nevertheless, as if ashamed of his injustice, he sent\r\nCherubini a large sum of money, and a commission to write the music for\r\nhis marriage ode. Several fine works followed in the next two years,\r\namong them the Mass in D, regarded by some of his admirers as his\r\necclesiastical masterpiece. Miel claims that in largeness of design and\r\ncomplication of detail, sublimity of conception and dramatic intensity,\r\ntwo works only of its class approach it, Beethoven's Mass in D and\r\nNiedermeyer's Mass in D minor.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 Halévy, the future author of \"La Juive,\" became Cherubini's\r\npupil, and a devoted friendship ever continued between the two. The\r\nopera of \"Les Abencérages\" was also produced, and it was pronounced\r\nnowise inferior to \"Médée\" and \"Les Deux Journées.\" Mendelssohn many\r\nyears afterward, writing to Moscheles in Paris, asked: \"Has Onslow\r\nwritten anything new? And old Cherubini? There's a matchless fellow!\r\nI have got his 'Abencérages,' and can not sufficiently admire the\r\nsparkling fire, the clear original phrasing, the extraordinary delicacy\r\nand refinement with which it is written, or feel grateful enough to the\r\ngrand old man for it. Besides, it is all so free and bold and spirited.\"\r\nThe work would have had a greater immediate success, had not Paris been\r\nin profound gloom from the disastrous results of the Moscow campaign and\r\nthe horrors of the French retreat, where famine and disease finished the\r\nwork of bayonet and cannon-ball.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled and disheartening times disturbed all the relations of\r\nartists. There is but little record of Cherubini for several years. A\r\nsignificant passage in a letter written in 1814, speaking of several\r\nmilitary marches written for a Prussian band, indicates the occupation\r\nof Paris by the allies and Napoleon's banishment in Elba. The period of\r\n\"The Hundred Days\" was spent by Cherubini in England; and the world's\r\nwonder, the battle of Waterloo, was fought, and the Bourbons were\r\npermanently restored, before he again set foot in Paris. The restored\r\ndynasty delighted to honor the man whom Napoleon had slighted, and gifts\r\nwere showered on him alike by the Court and by the leading academies of\r\nEurope. The walls of his studio were covered with medals and diplomas;\r\nand his appointment as director of the King's chapel (which, however, he\r\nrefused unless shared with Lesueur, the old incumbent) placed him above\r\nthe daily demands of want. So, at the age of fifty-five, this great\r\ncomposer for the first time ceased to be anxious on the score of his\r\nlivelihood. Thenceforward the life of Cherubini was destined to flow\r\nwith a placid current, its chief incidents being the great works in\r\nchurch music, which he poured forth year after year, to the admiration\r\nand delight of the artistic world. These remarkable masses, by their\r\ndramatic power, greatness of design, and wealth of instrumentation,\r\nexcited as much discussion and interest throughout Europe as the operas\r\nof other composers. That written in 1816, the C minor requiem mass, is\r\npronounced by Berlioz to be the greatest work of this description ever\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nWe get some pleasant glimpses of Cherubini as a man during this serene\r\nautumn of his life. Spohr tells us how cordially Cherubini,\r\ngenerally regarded as an austere and irritable man, received him.\r\nThe world-renowned master, accustomed to handle instruments in great\r\norchestral masses, was not familiar with the smaller compositions known\r\nas chamber music, in which the Germans so excelled. He was greatly\r\ndelighted when the youthful Spohr turned his attention to this form of\r\nmusic, and he insisted on the latter directing little concerts over and\r\nover again at his house.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 Moscheles writes in his diary, apropos of Cherubini and his\r\nartistic surroundings: \"I spent the evening at Ciceri's, son in-law of\r\nIsabey, the famous painter, where I was introduced to one of the most\r\ninteresting circles of artists. In the first room were assembled the\r\nmost famous painters, engaged in drawing several things for their own\r\namusement. In the midst of these was Cherubim, also drawing. I had the\r\nhonor, like every one newly introduced, of having my portrait taken in\r\ncaricature. Bégasse took me in hand and succeeded well. In an adjoining\r\nroom were musicians and actors, among them Ponchard, Levasseur, Dugazon,\r\nPanseron, Mlle, de Munck, and Mme. Livère, of the Theatre Français. The\r\nmost interesting of their performances, which I attended merely as\r\na listener, was a vocal quartet by Cherubini, performed under his\r\ndirection. Later in the evening, the whole party armed itself with\r\nlarger or smaller 'mirlitons' (reed-pipe whistles), and on these small\r\nmonotonous instruments, sometimes made of sugar, they played, after\r\nthe fashion of Russian horn music, the overture to 'Demophon,'\r\ntwo frying-pans representing the drums.\" On the 27th of March this\r\n\"mirliton\" concert was repeated at Ciceri's, and on this occasion\r\nCherubini took an active part. Moscheles relates of that evening:\r\n\"Horace Vernet entertained us with his ventriloquizing powers, M. Salmon\r\nwith his imitation of a horn, and Dugazon actually with a mirliton solo.\r\nLafont and I represented the classical music, which, after all, held its\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nThe distinguished pianist, in further pleasant gossip about Cherubini,\r\ntells us of hearing the first performance of a pasticcio opera, composed\r\nby Cherubini, Paër, Berton, Boïeldieu, and Kreutzer, in honor of the\r\nchristening of the Duke of Bordeaux. Of the part written by Cherubini he\r\nspeaks in the warmest praise, and says quizzically of the composer:\r\n\"His squeaky sharp little voice was sometimes heard in the midst of his\r\nconducting, and interrupted my state of ecstasy caused by his presence\r\nand composition.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1822 Cherubini became Director of the reestablished Conservatory,\r\nthat institution having fallen into some decay, and displayed great\r\nadministrative power and grasp of detail in bringing order out of chaos.\r\nHis vigilance and experience, seconded by an able staff of professors,\r\nincluding the foremost musical names of France, soon made the\r\nConservatory what it has since re? mained, the greatest musical college\r\nof the world. He was incessant in the performance of his duties, and\r\nspared neither himself nor his staff of professors to build up the\r\ninstitution. His spirit communicated itself both to masters and pupils.\r\nTen o'clock every morning saw him at his office, and interviews even\r\nwith the great were timed watch in hand. This law of order even prompted\r\nhim to rebuke the Minister of Fine Arts severely when one day that\r\nfunctionary met an appointment tardily. Fétis tells us: \"To his new\r\nfunctions he brought the most scrupulous exactitude of duty, that spirit\r\nof order which he possessed during the whole of his life, and an entire\r\ndevotion to the prosperity of the establishment. Severe and exacting\r\ntoward the professors and servants as he was with himself, he brought\r\nwith him little love in his connections with the artists placed under\r\nhis authority.\" His official duties finished, this incessant worker\r\noccupied his time with original composition, or copying out the scores\r\nof other composers from memory.\r\n\r\nThough habitually cold and severe in his manner during these latter\r\nyears, there was a spring of playful tenderness beneath. One day a child\r\nof great talent was brought by his father, a poor man, to see Cherubini.\r\nThe latter's first exclamation was: \"This is not a nursing hospital for\r\ninfants.\" Relenting somewhat, he questioned the boy, and soon discovered\r\nhis remarkable talents. The same old man was charmed and caressed the\r\nyoungster, saying, \"Bravo, my little friend! But why are you here, and\r\nwhat can I do for you?\" \"A thing that is very easy, and which would make\r\nme very happy,\" was the reply; \"put me into the Conservatory.\" \"It's a\r\nthing done,\" said Cherubini; \"you are one of us.\" He afterward said to\r\nhis friends playfully: \"I had to be careful about pushing the questions\r\ntoo far, for the baby was beginning to prove that he knew more about\r\nmusic than I did myself.\"\r\n\r\nHis merciless criticism of his pupils did not surpass his own modesty\r\nand diffidence. One day, when a symphony of Beethoven was about to be\r\nplayed at a concert, just prior to one of his own works, he said, \"Now I\r\nam going to appear as a very small boy indeed.\" The mutual affection of\r\nCherubini and Beethoven remained unabated through life, as is shown by\r\nthe touching letter written by the latter just before his death, but\r\nwhich Cherubini did not receive till after that event. The letter was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nVienna, March 15,1823.\r\n\r\nHighly esteemed Sir: I joyfully take advantage of this opportunity to\r\naddress you.\r\n\r\nI have done so often in spirit, as I prize your theatrical works beyond\r\nothers. The artistic world has only to lament that in Germany, at least,\r\nno new dramatic work of yours has appeared. Highly as all your works\r\nare valued by true connoisseurs, still it is a great loss to art not to\r\npossess any fresh production of your great genius for the theatre.\r\n\r\nTrue art is imperishable, and the true artist feels heartfelt pleasure\r\nin grand works of genius, and that id what enchants me when I hear a new\r\ncomposition of yours; in fact, I take greater interest in it than in my\r\nown; in short, I love and honor you. Were it not that my continued bad\r\nhealth stops my coming to see you in Paris, with what exceeding delight\r\nwould I discuss questions of art with you! Do not think that this is\r\nmeant merely to serve as an introduction to the favor I am about to ask\r\nof you. I hope and feel sure that you do not for a moment suspect me of\r\nsuch base sentiments. I recently completed a grand solemn Mass, and have\r\nresolved to offer it to the various European courts, as it is not my\r\nintention to publish it at present. I have therefore asked the King of\r\nFrance, through the French embassy here, to subscribe to this work, and\r\nI feel certain that his Majesty would at your recommendation agree to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nMy critical situation demands that I should not solely fix my eyes upon\r\nheaven, as is my wont; on the contrary, it would have me fix them also\r\nupon earth, here below, for the necessities of life.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the fate of my request to you, I shall for ever continue\r\nto love and esteem you; and you for ever remain of all my contemporaries\r\nthat one whom I esteem the most.\r\n\r\nIf you should wish to do me a very great favor, you would effect this by\r\nwriting to me a few lines, which would solace me much. Art unites all;\r\nhow much more, then, true artists! and perhaps you may deem me worthy of\r\nbeing included in that number.\r\n\r\nWith the highest esteem, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nLUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.\r\n\r\nLUDWIG CHERUBINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCherubini's admiration of the great German is indicated in an anecdote\r\ntold by Professor Ella. The master rebuked a pupil who, in referring\r\nto a performance of a Beethoven symphony, dwelt mostly on the executive\r\nexcellence: \"Young man, let your sympathies be first wedded to the\r\ncreation, and be you less fastidious of the execution; accept the\r\ninterpretation, and think more of the creation of these musical works\r\nwhich are written for all time and all nations, models for imitation and\r\nabove all criticism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nAs a man Cherubini presented himself in many different aspects.\r\nExtremely nervous, _brusque_, irritable, and absolutely independent, he\r\nwas apt to offend and repel. But under his stern reserve of character\r\nthere beat a warm heart and generous sympathies. This is shown by the\r\nfact that, in spite of the unevenness of his temper, he was almost\r\nworshiped by those around him. Auber, Halévy, Berton, Boïeldieu, Méhul,\r\nSpontini, and Adam, who were so intimately associated with him, speak of\r\nhim with words of the warmest affection. Halévy, indeed, rarely alluded\r\nto him without tears rushing to his eyes; and the slightest term of\r\ndisrespect excited his warmest indignation. It is recorded that, after\r\nrebuking a pupil with sarcastic severity, his fine face would relax with\r\na smile so affectionate and genial that his whilom victim could feel\r\nnothing but enthusiastic respect. Without one taint of envy in his\r\nnature, conscious of his own extraordinary powers, he was quick to\r\nrecognize genius in others; and his hearty praise of the powers of\r\nhis rivals shows how sound and generous the heart was under his\r\nirritability. His proneness to satire and power of epigram made him\r\nenemies, but even these yielded to the suavity and fascination which\r\nalternated with his bitter moods. His sympathies were peculiarly open\r\nfor young musicians. Mendelssohn and Liszt were stimulated by his warm\r\nand encouraging praise when they first visited Paris; and even Berlioz,\r\nwhose turbulent conduct in the Conservatory had so embittered him at\r\nvarious times, was heartily applauded when his first great mass was\r\nproduced. Arnold gives us the following pleasant picture of Cherubini:\r\n\r\n\"Cherubini in society was outwardly silent, modest, unassuming,\r\npleasing, obliging, and possessed of the finest manners. At the same\r\ntime, he who did not know that he was with Cherubini would think\r\nhim stern and reserved, so well did the composer know how to conceal\r\neverything, if only to avoid ostentation. He truly shunned brag or\r\nspeaking of himself. Cherubini's voice was feeble, probably from\r\nnarrow-chestedness, and somewhat hoarse, but was otherwise soft and\r\nagreeable. His French was Italianized.... His head was bent forward,\r\nhis nose was large and aquiline; his eyebrows were thick, black,\r\nand somewhat bushy, overshadowing his eyes. His eyes were dark, and\r\nglittered with an extraordinary brilliancy that animated in a wonderful\r\nway the whole face. A thin lock of hair came over the center of his\r\nforehead, and somehow gave to his countenance a peculiar softness.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture painted by Ingres, the great artist, now in the Luxembourg\r\ngallery, represents the composer with Polyhymnia in the background\r\nstretching out her hand over him. His face, framed in waving silvery\r\nhair, is full of majesty and brightness, and the eye of piercing luster.\r\nCherubini was so gratified by this effort of the painter that he sent\r\nhim a beautiful canon set to wrords of his own. Thus his latter years\r\nwere spent in the society of the great artists and wits of Paris,\r\nrevered by all, and recognized, after Beethoven's death, as the musical\r\ngiant of Europe. Rossini, Meyerbeer, Weber, Schumann--in a word, the\r\nrepresentatives of the most diverse schools of composition--bowed\r\nequally before this great name. Rossini, who was his antipodes in genius\r\nand method, felt his loss bitterly, and after his death sent Cherubini's\r\nportrait to his widow with these touching words: \"Here, my dear madam,\r\nis the portrait of a great man, who is as young in your heart as he is\r\nin my mind.\"\r\n\r\nActively engaged as Director of the Conservatory, which he governed with\r\nconsummate ability, his old age was further employed in producing that\r\nseries of great masses which rank with the symphonies of Beethoven. His\r\ncreative instinct and the fire of his imagination remained unimpaired\r\nto the time of his death. Mendelssohn in a letter to Moscheles speaks\r\nof him as \"that truly wonderful old man, whose genius seems bathed\r\nin immortal youth.\" His opera of \"Ali Baba,\" composed at seventy-six,\r\nthough inferior to his other dramatic works, is full of beautiful and\r\noriginal music, and was immediately produced in several of the principal\r\ncapitals of Europe; and the second Requiem mass, written in his\r\neightieth year, is one of his masterpieces.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March, 1842, the old composer died, surrounded by his\r\naffectionate family and friends. His fatal illness had been brought on\r\nin part by grief for the death of his son-in-law, M. Tureas, to whom he\r\nwas most tenderly attached. His funeral was one of great military and\r\ncivic magnificence, and royalty itself could not have been honored\r\nwith more splendid obsequies. The congregation of men great in arms\r\nand state, in music, painting, and literature, who did honor to the\r\noccasion, has rarely been equaled. His own noble Requiem mass, composed\r\nthe year before his death, was given at the funeral services in the\r\nchurch of St. Roch by the finest orchestra and voices in Europe. Similar\r\nservices were held throughout Europe, and everywhere the opera-houses\r\nwere draped in black. Perhaps the death of no musician ever called forth\r\nsuch universal exhibitions of sorrow and reverence.\r\n\r\nCherubini's life extended from the early part of the reign of Louis XVI.\r\nto that of Louis Philippe, and was contemporaneous with many of the\r\nmost remarkable events in modern history. The energy and passion which\r\nconvulsed society during his youth and early manhood undoubtedly had\r\nmuch to do in stimulating that robust and virile quality in his mind\r\nwhich gave such character to his compositions. The fecundity of his\r\nintellect is shown in the fact that he produced four hundred and thirty\r\nworks, out of which only eighty have been published. In this catalogue\r\nthere are twenty-five operas and eleven masses.\r\n\r\nAs an operatic composer he laid the foundation of the modern French\r\nschool. Uniting the melody of the Italian with the science of the\r\nGerman, his conceptions had a dramatic fire and passion which were,\r\nhowever, free from anything appertaining to the sensational and\r\nmeretricious. His forms were indeed classically severe, and his style is\r\ndefined by Adolphe Adam as the resurrection of the old Italian school,\r\nenriched by the discoveries of modern harmony. Though he was the creator\r\nof French opera as we know it now, he was free from its vagaries\r\nand extravagances. He set its model in the dramatic vigor and\r\npicturesqueness, the clean-cut forms, and the noble instrumentation\r\nwhich mark such masterpieces as \"Faniska,\" \"Alédée,\" \"Les Deux\r\nJournées,\" and \"Lodoïska.\" The purity, classicism, and wealth of ideas\r\nin these works have always caused them to be cited as standards of ideal\r\nexcellence. The reforms in opera of which Gluck was the protagonist, and\r\nWagner the extreme modern exponent, characterize the dramatic works\r\nof Cherubini, though he keeps them within that artistic limit which a\r\nproper regard for melodic beauty prescribes. In the power and propriety\r\nof musical declamation his operas are conceded to be without a\r\nsuperior. His overtures hold their place in classical music as ranking\r\nwith the best ever written, and show a richness of resource and\r\nknowledge of form in treating the orchestra which his his contemporaries\r\nadmitted were only equaled by Beethoven.\r\n\r\nCherubini's place in ecclesiastical music is that by which he is best\r\nknown to the musical public of to-day; for his operas, owing to the\r\nimmense demands they make on the dramatic and vocal resources of the\r\nartist, are but rarely presented in France, Germany, and England, and\r\nnever in America. They are only given where music is loved on account\r\nof its noble traditions, and not for the mere sake of idle and luxurious\r\namusement. As a composer of masses, however, Cherubini's genius is\r\nfamiliar to all who frequent the services of the Roman Church. His\r\nrelation to the music of Catholicism accords with that of Sebastian Bach\r\nto the music of Protestantism. Haydn, Mozart, and even Beethoven,\r\nare held by the best critics to be his inferiors in this form of\r\ncomposition. His richness of melody, sense of dramatic color, and\r\ngreat command of orchestral effects, gave him commanding power in the\r\ninterpretation of religious sentiments; while an ardent faith inspired\r\nwith passion, sweetness, and devotion what Place styles his \"sublime\r\nvisions.\" Miel, one of his most competent critics, writes of him in this\r\neloquent strain: \"If he represents the passion and death of Christ, the\r\nheart feels itself wounded with the most sublime emotion; and when\r\nhe recounts the 'Last Judgment' the blood freezes with dread at the\r\nredoubled and menacing calls of the exterminating angel. All those\r\nadmirable pictures that the Raphaels and Michael Angelos have painted\r\nwith colors and the brush, Cherubini brings forth with the voice and\r\norchestra.\" In brief, if Cherubini is the founder of a later school\r\nof opera, and the model which his successors have always honored and\r\nstudied if they have not always followed, no less is he the chief of\r\na later, and by common consent the greatest, school of modern church\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMÉHUL, SPONTINI, AND HALÉVY.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Gluck was not confined to Cherubini, but was hardly\r\nless manifest in molding the style and conceptions of Méhul and\r\nSpontini,* who held prominent places in the history of the French opera.\r\n\r\n     * It is a little singular that some of the most\r\n     distinguished names in the annals of French music were\r\n     foreigners. Thus Gluck was a German, as also was Meyerbeer,\r\n     while Cherubini and Spontini were Italians.\r\n\r\nHenri Etienne Méhul was the son of a French soldier stationed at the\r\nGivet barracks, where he was born June 24, 1763. His early love of music\r\nsecured for him instructions from the blind organist of the Franciscan\r\nchurch at that garrison town, under whom he made astonishing progress.\r\nHe soon found he had outstripped the attainments of his teacher, and\r\ncontrived to place himself under the tuition of the celebrated Wilhelm\r\nHemser, who was organist at a neighboring monastery. Here Méhul spent a\r\nnumber of happy and useful years, studying composition with Hemser and\r\nliterature with the kind monks, who hoped to persuade their young charge\r\nto devote himself to ecclesiastical life.\r\n\r\nMéhul's advent in Paris, whither he went at the age of sixteen, soon\r\nopened his eyes to his true vocation, that of a dramatic composer. The\r\nexcitement over the contest between Gluck and Piccini was then at its\r\nheight, and the youthful musician was not long in espousing the side of\r\nGluck with enthusiasm. He made the acquaintance of Gluck accidentally,\r\nthe great ehevalier interposing one night to prevent his being ejected\r\nfrom the theatre, into one of whose boxes Méhul had slipped without\r\nbuying a ticket. Thence forward the youth had free access to the opera,\r\nand the friendship and tuition of one of the master minds of the age.\r\n\r\nAn opera, \"Cora et Alonzo,\" had been composed at the age of twenty and\r\naccepted at the opera; but it was not till 1790 that he got a hearing in\r\nthe comic opera of \"Euphrasque et Coradin,\" composed under the direction\r\nof Gluck. This work was brilliantly successful, and \"Stratonice,\" which\r\nanpeared two years afterward, established his reputation. The French\r\ncritics describe both these early works as being equally admirable in\r\nmelody, orchestral accompaniment, and dramatic effect. The stormiest\r\nyear of the revolution was not favorable to operatic composition, and\r\nMéhul wrote but little music except pieces for republican festivities,\r\nmuch to his own disgust, for he was by no means a warm friend of the\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 he produced his \"Le Jeune Henri,\" which nearly caused a riot in\r\nthe theatre. The story displeased the republican audience, who hissed\r\nand hooted till the turmoil compelled the fall of the curtain. They\r\ninsisted, however, on the overture, which is one of great beauty,\r\nbeing performed over and over again, a compliment which has rarely been\r\naccorded to any composer. Méhul's appointment as inspector and professor\r\nin the newly organized Conservatory, at the same time with Cherubini,\r\nleft him but little leisure for musical composition; but he found time\r\nto write the spectacular opera \"Adrian,\" which was fiercely condemned by\r\na republican audience, not as a musical failure, but because their alert\r\nand suspicious tempers suspected in it covert allusions to the dead\r\nmonarchy. Even David, the painter, said he would set the torch to the\r\nopera-house rather than witness the triumph of a king. In 1806 Méhul\r\nproduced the opera \"Uthal,\" a work of striking vigor founded on an\r\nOssianic theme, in which he made the innovation of banishing the violins\r\nfrom the orchestra, substituting therefor the violas.\r\n\r\nIt was in \"Joseph,\" however, composed in 1807, that this composer\r\nvindicated his right to be called a musician of great genius, and\r\nentered fully into a species of composition befitting his grand style.\r\nMost of his contemporaries were incapable of appreciating the greatness\r\nof the work, though his gifted rival Cherubini gave it the warmest\r\npraise. In Germany it met with instant and extended success, and it is\r\none of the few French operas of the old school which still continue to\r\nbe given on the German stage. In England it is now frequently sung as an\r\noratorio. It is on this remarkable work that Méhul's lasting reputation\r\nas a composer rests outside of his own nation. The construction of\r\nthe opera of \"Joseph\" is characterized by admirable symmetry of form,\r\ndramatic power, and majesty of the choral and concerted passages,\r\nwhile the sustained beauty of the orchestration is such as to challenge\r\ncomparison with the greatest works of his contemporaries. Such at\r\nleast is the verdict of Fétis, who was by no means inclined to be\r\nover-indulgent in criticising Méhul. The fault in this opera, as in all\r\nof Méhul's works, appears to have been a lack of bright and graceful\r\nmelody, though in the modern tendencies of music this defect is rapidly\r\nbeing elevated into a virtue.\r\n\r\nThe last eight years of Méhul's life were depressed by melancholy and\r\nsuffering, proceeding from pulmonary disease. He resigned his place in\r\nthe Conservatory, and retired to a pleasant little estate near Paris,\r\nwhere he devoted himself to raising flowers, and found some solace in\r\nthe society of his musical friends and former pupils, who were assiduous\r\nin their attentions. Finally becoming dangerously ill, he went to the\r\nisland of Hyères to find a more genial climate. But here he pined for\r\nParis and the old companionships, and suffered more perhaps by fretting\r\nfor the intellectual cheer of his old life than he gained by balmy air\r\nand sunshine. He writes to one of his friends after a short stay at\r\nHyères: \"I have broken up all my habits; I am deprived of all my old\r\nfriends; I am alone at the end of the world, surrounded by people whose\r\nlanguage I scarcely understand; and all this sacrifice to obtain a\r\nlittle more sun. The air which best agrees with me is that which I\r\nbreathe among you.\" He returned to Paris for a few weeks only, to\r\nbreathe his last on October 18, 1817, aged fifty-four.\r\n\r\nMéhul was a high-minded and benevolent man, wrapped up in his art,\r\nand singularly childlike in the practical affairs of life. Abhorring\r\nintrigue, he was above all petty jealousies, and even sacrificed the\r\nsituation of chapel-master under Napoleon, because he believed it should\r\nhave been given to the greatest of his rivals, Cherubini. When he\r\ndied Paris recognized his goodness as a man as well as greatness as a\r\nmusician by a touching and spontaneous expression of grief, and funeral\r\nhonors were given him throughout Europe. In 1822 his statue was crowned\r\non the stage of the Grand Opera, at a performance of his \"Valentine de\r\nRohan.\" Notwithstanding his early death, he composed forty-two operas,\r\nand modern musicians and critics give him a notable place among those\r\nwho were prominent in building up a national stage. A pupil and disciple\r\nof Gluck, a cordial co-worker with Cherubini, he contributed largely to\r\nthe glory of French music, not only by his genius as a composer, but\r\nby his important labors in the reorganization of the Conservatory,\r\nthat nursery which has fed so much of the highest musical talent of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nLuigi Gaspardo Pacifico Spontini, born of peasant parents at Majolati,\r\nItaly, November 14, 1774, displayed his musical passion at an early age.\r\nDesigned for holy orders from childhood, his priestly tutors could not\r\nmake him study; but he delighted in the service of the church, with its\r\nor^an and choir effects, for here his true vocation asserted itself. He\r\nwas wont, too, to hide in the belfry, and revel in the roaring orchestra\r\nof metal, when the chimes were rung. On one occasion a stroke of\r\nlightning precipitated him from his dangerous perch to the floor below,\r\nand the history of music nearly lost one of its great lights. The bias\r\nof his nature was intractable, and he was at last permitted to study\r\nmusic, at first under the charge of his uncle Joseph, the cure of Jesi,\r\nand finally at the Naples Conservatory, where he was entered at the age\r\nof sixteen.\r\n\r\nHis first opera, \"I Puntigli delle Donne,\" was composed at the age of\r\ntwenty-one, and performed at Rome, where it was kindly received. The\r\nFrench invasion unsettled the affairs of Italy, and Spontini wandered\r\nsomewhat aimlessly, unable to exercise his talents to advantage till he\r\nwent to Paris in 1803, where he found a large number of brother Italian\r\nmusicians, and a cordial reception, though himself an obscure and\r\nuntried youth. He produced several minor works on the French stage,\r\nnoticeably among them the one-act opera of \"Milton,\" in which he stepped\r\nboldly out of his Italian mannerism, and entered on that path afterward\r\npursued with such brilliancy and boldness. Yet, though his talents began\r\nto be recognized, life was a trying struggle, and it is doubtful if he\r\ncould have overcome the difficulties in his way when he was ready to\r\nproduce \"La Vestale,\" had he not enlisted the sympathies of the\r\nEmpress Josephine, who loved music, and played the part of patroness as\r\ngracefully as she did all others.\r\n\r\nBy Napoleon's order \"La Vestale\" was rehearsed against the wish of the\r\nmanager and critics of the Academy of Music, and produced December 15,\r\n1807. Previous to this some parts of it had been performed privately\r\nat the Tuileries, and the Emperor had said: \"M. Spontini, your opera\r\nabounds in fine airs and effective duets. The march to the place of\r\nexecution is admirable. You will certainly have the great success you\r\nso well deserve.\" The imperial prediction was justified by consecutive\r\nperformances of one hundred nights. His next work, \"Fernand Cortez,\"\r\nsustained the impression of genius earned for him by its predecessor.\r\nThe scene of the revolt is pronounced by competent critics to be one of\r\nthe finest dramatic conceptions in operatic music.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Spontini married the niece of Erard, the great pianoforte-maker,\r\nand was called to the direction of the Italian opera; but he retained\r\nthis position only two years, from the disagreeable conditions he had to\r\ncontend with, and the cabals that were formed against him. The year 1814\r\nwitnessed the production of \"Pelage,\" and two years later \"Les Dieux\r\nRivaux\" was composed, in conjunction with Persuis, Berton, and Kreutzer;\r\nbut neither work attracted much attention. The opera of \"Olympic,\"\r\nworked out on the plan of \"La Vestale\" and \"Cortez,\" was produced in\r\n1819. Spontini was embittered by its poor success, for he had built many\r\nhopes on it, and wrought long and patiently. That he was not in his best\r\nvein, and like many other men of genius was not always able to estimate\r\njustly his own work, is undeniable; for Spontini, contrary to the\r\nopinion of his contemporaries and of posterity, regarded this as his\r\nbest opera. His acceptance of the Prussian King's offer to become\r\nmusical director at Berlin was the result of his chagrin. Here he\r\nremained for twenty years. \"Olympic\" succeeded better at Berlin, though\r\nthe boisterousness of the music seems to have called out some sharp\r\nstrictures even among the Berlinese, whose penchant for noisy operatic\r\neffects was then as now a butt for the satire of the musical wits.\r\nApropos of the long run of \"Olympic\" at Berlin, an amusing anecdote\r\nis told on the authority of Castel-Blaze. A wealthy amateur had become\r\ndeaf, and suffered much from his deprivation of the enjoyment of his\r\nfavorite art. After trying many physicians, he was treated in a novel\r\nfashion by his latest doctor. \"Come with me to the opera this evening,\"\r\nwrote down the doctor. \"What's the use? I can't hear a note,\" was the\r\nimpatient rejoinder. \"Never mind,\" said the other; \"come, and you will\r\nsee something at all events.\" So the twain repaired to the theatre to\r\nhear Spontini's \"Olympie.\" All went well till one of the overwhelming\r\nfinales, which happened to be played that evening more _fortissimo_\r\nthan usual. The patient turned around beaming with delight, exclaiming,\r\n\"Doctor, I can hear.\" As there was no reply, the happy patient again\r\nsaid, \"Doctor, I tell you, you have cured me.\" A blank stare alone met\r\nhim, and he found that the doctor was as deaf as a post, having fallen\r\na victim to his own prescription. The German wits had a similar joke\r\nafterward at Halévy's expense. The \"Punch\" of Vienna said that Halévy\r\nmade the brass play so loudly that the French horn was actually blown\r\nquite straight.\r\n\r\nAmong the works produced at Berlin were \"Nurmahal,\" in 1825; \"Alcidor,\"\r\nthe same year; and in 1829, \"Agnes von Hohenstaufen.\" Various other new\r\nworks were given from time to time, but none achieved more than a brief\r\nhearing. Spontini's stiff-necked and arrogant will kept him in continual\r\ntrouble, and the Berlin press aimed its arrows at him with incessant\r\nvirulence: a war which the composer fed by his bitter and witty\r\nrejoinders, for he was an adept in the art of invective. Had he not been\r\nsingularly adroit, he would have been obliged to leave his post. But\r\nhe gloried in the disturbance he created, and was proof against the\r\nassaults of his numerous enemies, made so largely by his having come\r\nof the French school, then as now an all-sufficient cause of Teutonic\r\ndislike. Spontini's unbending intolerance, however, at last undermined\r\nhis musical supremacy, so long held good with an iron hand; and an\r\nintrigue headed by Count Brühl, intendant of the Royal Theatre, at last\r\nobliged him to resign after a rule of a score of years. His influence on\r\nthe lyric theatre of Berlin, however, had been valuable, and he had the\r\nglory of forming singers among the Prussians, who until his time had\r\nthought more of cornet-playing than of beautiful and true vocalization.\r\nThe Prussian King allowed him on his departure a pension of 16,000\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nWhen Spontini returned to Paris, though he was appointed member of the\r\nAcademy of Fine Arts, he was received with some coldness by the musical\r\nworld. He had no little difficulty in getting a production of his\r\noperas; only the Conservatory remained faithful to him, and in their\r\nhall large audiences gathered to hear compositions to which the\r\nopera-house denied its stage. New idols attracted the public, and\r\nSpontini, though burdened with all the orders of Europe, was obliged to\r\nrest in the traditions of his earlier career. A passionate desire to see\r\nhis native land before death made him leave Paris in 1850, and he went\r\nto Majolati, the town of his birth, where he died after a residence of a\r\nfew months. His cradle was his tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nA well-known musical critic sums up his judgment of Halévy in these\r\nwords: \"If in France a contemporary of Louis XIV., an admirer of Racine,\r\ncould return to us, and, full of the remembrance of his earthly career\r\nunder that renowned monarch, he should wish to find the nobly pathetic,\r\nthe elevated inspiration, the majestic arrangements of the olden times\r\nupon a modern stage, we would not take him to the Theatre Français, but\r\nto the Opera on the day in which one of Halévy's works was given.\"\r\n\r\nUnlike Méhul and Spontini, with whom in point of style and method Halévy\r\nmust be associated, he was not in any direct sense a disciple of Gluck,\r\nbut inherited the influence of the latter through his great successor\r\nCherubini, of whom Halévy was the favorite pupil and the intimate\r\nfriend. Fromental Halévy, a scion of the Hebrew race, which has\r\nfurnished so many geniuses to the art world, left a deep impress on\r\nhis times, not simply by his genius and musical knowledge, which was\r\nprofound, varied, and accurate, but by the elevation and nobility which\r\nlifted his mark up to a higher level than that which we accord to\r\nmere musical gifts, be they ever so rich and fertile. The motive that\r\ninspired his life is suggested in his devout saying that music is an\r\nart that God has given us, in which the voices of all nations may unite\r\ntheir prayers in one harmonious rhythm.\r\n\r\nHalévy was a native of Paris, born May 27, 1799. He entered the\r\nConservatory at the age of eleven years, where he soon attracted the\r\nparticular attention of Cherubini. When he was twenty the Institute\r\nawarded him the grand prize for the composition of a cantata; and he\r\nalso received a government pension which enabled him to dwell at Rome\r\nfor two years, assiduously cultivating his talents in composition.\r\nHalévy returned to Paris, but it was not till 1827 that he succeeded\r\nin having an opera produced. This portion of his life was full of\r\ndisappointment and chilled ambitions; for, in spite of the warm\r\nfriendship of Cherubini, who did everything to advance his interests, he\r\nseemed to make but slow progress in popular estimation, though a number\r\nof operas were produced.\r\n\r\nHalévy's full recognition, however, was found in the great work of \"La\r\nJuive,\" produced February 23, 1835, with lavish magnificence. It is said\r\nthat the managers of the Opera expended 150,000 francs in putting it\r\non the stage. This opera, which surpasses all his others in passion,\r\nstrength, and dignity of treatment, was interpreted by the greatest\r\nsingers in Europe, and the public reception at once assured the composer\r\nthat his place in music was fixed. Many envious critics, however,\r\ndeclaimed against him, asserting that success was not the legitimate\r\ndesert of the opera, but of its magnificent presentation. Halévy\r\nanswered his detractors by giving the world a delightful comic opera,\r\n\"L'Éclair,\" which at once testified to the genuineness of his musical\r\ninspiration and the versatility of his powers, and was received by the\r\npublic with even more pleasure than \"La Juive.\"\r\n\r\nHalévy's next brilliant stroke (three unsuccessful works in the mean\r\nwhile having been written) was \"La Reine de Chypre,\" produced in 1841.\r\nA somewhat singular fact occurred during the performance of this opera.\r\nOne of the singers, every time he came to the passage,\r\n\r\n     Ce mortel qu'on remarque\r\n     Tient-il Plus que nous de la Parque\r\n     Le fil?\r\n\r\nwas in the habit of fixing his eyes on a certain proscenium box wherein\r\nwere wont to sit certain notabilities in politics and finance. As\r\nseveral of these died during the first run of the work, superstitious\r\npeople thought the box was bewitched, and no one cared to occupy it. Two\r\nfine works, \"Charles VI.\" and \"Le Val d'Andorre,\" succeeded at intervals\r\nof a few years; and in 1849 the noble music to Æschylus's \"Prometheus\r\nBound\" was written with an idea of reproducing the supposed effects of\r\nthe enharmonic style of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nHalévy's opera of \"The Tempest,\" written for London, and produced in\r\n1850, rivaled the success of \"La Juive.\" Balfe led the orchestra, and\r\nits popularity caused the basso Lablache to write the following epigram:\r\n\r\n     The \"Tempest\" of Halévy\r\n     Differs from other tempests.\r\n     These rain hail,\r\n     That rains gold.\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Fine Arts elected the composer secretary in 1854, and\r\nin the exercise of his duties, which involved considerable literary\r\ncomposition, Halévy showed the same elegance of style and good taste\r\nwhich marked his musical writings. He did not, however, neglect his own\r\nproper work, and a succession of operas, which were cordially received,\r\nproved how unimpaired and vigorous his intellectual faculties remained.\r\n\r\nThe composer's death occurred at Nice, whither he had gone on account of\r\nfailing strength, March 17, 1862. His last moments were cheered by\r\nthe attentions of his family and the consolations of philosophy and\r\nliterature, which he dearly loved to discuss with his friends. His\r\nruling passion displayed itself shortly before his end in characteristic\r\nfashion. Trying in vain to reach a book on the table, he said: \"Can I do\r\nnothing now in time?\" On the morning of his death, wishing to be turned\r\non his bed, he said to his daughter, \"Lay me down like a gamut,\" at\r\neach movement repeating with a soft smile, \"Do, re, mi,\" etc., until the\r\nchange was made. These were his last words.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated French critic Sainte-Beuve pays a charming tribute to\r\nHalévy, whom he knew and loved well:\r\n\r\n\"Halévy had a natural talent for writing, which he cultivated and\r\nperfected by study, by a taste for reading which he always\r\ngratified in the intervals of labor, in his study, in public\r\nconveyances--everywhere, in fine, when he had a minute to spare. He\r\ncould isolate himself completely in the midst of the various noises of\r\nhis family, or the conversation of the drawing-room if he had no part in\r\nit. He wrote music, poetry, and prose, and he read with imperturbable\r\nattention while people around him talked.\r\n\r\n\"He possessed the instinct of languages, was familiar with German,\r\nItalian, English, and Latin, knew something of Hebrew and Greek. He was\r\nconversant with etymology, and had a perfect passion for dictionaries.\r\nIt was often difficult for him to find a word; for on opening the\r\ndictionary somewhere near the word for which he was looking, if his eye\r\nchanced to fall on some other, no matter what, he stopped to read that,\r\nthen another and another, until he sometimes forgot the word he sought.\r\nIt is singular that this estimable man, so fully occupied, should at\r\ntimes have nourished some secret sadness. Whatever the hidden wound\r\nmight be, none, not even his most intimate friends, knew what it was.\r\nHe never made any complaint. Halévy's nature was rich, open and\r\ncommunicative. He was well organized, accessible to the sweets of\r\nsociability and family joys. In fine, he had, as one may say, too many\r\nstrings to his bow to be very unhappy for any length of time. To define\r\nhim practically, I would say he was a bee that had not lodged himself\r\ncompletely in his hive, but was seeking to make honey elsewhere too.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nMÉHUL labored successfully in adapting the noble and severe style of\r\nGluck to the changing requirements of the French stage. The turmoil and\r\npassions of the revolution had stirred men's souls to the very roots,\r\nand this influence was perpetuated and crystallized in the new forms\r\ngiven to French thought by Napoleon's wonderful career. Méhul's\r\nmusical conceptions, which culminated in the opera of \"Joseph,\" were\r\ncharacterized by a stir, a vigor, and largeness of dramatic movement,\r\nwhich came close to the familiar life of that remarkable period. His\r\ngreat rival Cherubini, on the other hand, though no less truly dramatic\r\nin fitting musical expression to thought and passion, was so austere\r\nand rigid in his ideals, so dominated by musical form and an accurate\r\nscience which would concede nothing to popular prejudice and ignorance,\r\nthat he won his laurels, not by force of the natural flow of popular\r\nsympathy, but by the sheer might of his genius. Cherubini's severe works\r\nmade them models and foundation stones for his successors in French\r\nmusic; but Méhul familiarized his audiences with strains dignified yet\r\npopular, full of massive effects and brilliant combinations. The people\r\nfelt the tramp of the Napoleonic armies in the vigor and movement of his\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nSpontini embodied the same influences and characteristics in still\r\nlarger degree, for his musical genius was organized on a more massive\r\nplan. Deficient in pure graceful melody alike with Méhul, he delighted\r\nin great masses of tone and vivid orchestral coloring. His music was\r\nfull of the military fire of his age, and dealt for the most part with\r\nthe peculiar tastes and passions engendered by a condition of chronic\r\nwarfare. Therefore dramatic movement in his operas was always of the\r\nheroic order, and never touched the more subtile and complex elements\r\nof life. Spontini added to the majestic repose and ideality of the Gluck\r\nmusic-drama (to use a name now naturalized in art by Wagner) the keenest\r\ndramatic vigor. Though he had a strong command of effects by his power\r\nof delineation and delicacy of detail, his prevalent tastes led him to\r\nencumber his music too often with overpowering military effects, alike\r\ntonal and scenic. Riehl, a great German critic, says: \"He is more\r\nsuccessful in the delineation of masses and groups than in the portrayal\r\nof emotional scenes; his rendering of the national struggle between the\r\nSpaniards and Mexicans in 'Cortez' is, for example, admirable. He\r\nis likewise most successful in the management of large masses in\r\nthe instrumentation. In this respect he was, like Napoleon, a great\r\ntactician.\" In \"La Vestale\" Spontini attained his _chef-d'oeuvre_.\r\nSchülter in his \"History of Music\" gives it the following encomium: \"His\r\nportrayal of character and truthful delineation of passionate emotion\r\nin this opera are masterly indeed. The subject of 'La Vestale' (which\r\nresembles that of 'Norma,' but how differently treated!) is tragic and\r\nsublime as well as intensely emotional. Julia, the heroine, a prey to\r\nguilty passion; the severe but kindly high priestess; Licinius, the\r\nadventurous lover, and his faithful friend Cinna; pious vestals,\r\ncruel priests, bold warriors, and haughty Romans, are represented with\r\nstatuesque relief and finish. Both these works, 'La Vestale' (1802)\r\nand 'Cortez' (1809), ire among the finest that have been written for the\r\nstage; they are remarkable for naturalness and sublimeness, qualities\r\nlost sight of in the noisy instrumentation of his later works.\"\r\n\r\nHalévy, trained under the influences of Cherubini, was largely inspired\r\nby that great master's musical purism and reverence for the higher laws\r\nof his art. Halévy's powerful sense of the dramatic always influenced\r\nhis methods and sympathies. Not being a composer of creative\r\nimagination, however, the melodramatic element is more prominent than\r\nthe purely tragic or comic. His music shows remarkable resources in the\r\nproduction of brilliant and captivating though always tasteful effects,\r\nwhich rather please the senses and the fancy than stir the heart and\r\nimagination. Here and there scattered through his works, notably so\r\nin \"La Juive,\" are touches of emotion and grandeur; but Halévy must\r\nbe characterized as a composer who is rather distinguished for the\r\nbrilliancy, vigor, and completeness of his art than for the higher\r\ncreative power, which belongs in such preeminent degree to men like\r\nRossini and Weber, or even to Auber, Meyerbeer, and Gounod. It is\r\nnevertheless true that Halévy composed works which will retain a high\r\nrank in French art. \"La Juive,\" \"Guido,\" \"La Reine de Chypre,\" and\r\n\"Charles VI.\" are noble lyric dramas, full of beauties, though it is\r\nsaid they can never be seen to the best advantage off the French stage.\r\nHalévy's genius and taste in music bear much the same relation to the\r\nFrench stage as do those of Verdi to the Italian stage; though the\r\nformer composer is conceded by critics to be a greater purist in musical\r\nform, if he rarely equals the Italian composer in the splendid bursts\r\nof musical passion with which the latter redeems so much that is\r\nmeretricious and false, and the charming melody which Verdi shares with\r\nhis countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOÏELDIEU AND AUBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe French school of light opera, founded by Givtry, reached its\r\ngreatest perfection in the authors of \"La Dame Blanche\" and \"Fra\r\nDiavolo,\" though to the former of these composers must be accorded the\r\npeculiar distinction of having given the most perfect example of this\r\nstyle of composition. François Adrien Boïeldieu, the scion of a Norman\r\nfamily, was born at Rouen, December 16, 1775. He received his early\r\nmusical training at the hands of Broche, a great musician and the\r\ncathedral organist, but a drunkard and brutal taskmaster. At the age of\r\nsixteen he had become a good pianist and knew something of composition.\r\nAt all events his passionate love of the theatre prompted him to try his\r\nhand at an opera, which was actually performed at Rouen. The revolution\r\nwhich made such havoc with the clergy and their dependents ruined\r\nthe Boïeldieu family (the elder Boïeldieu had been secretary of the\r\narchiépiscopal diocese), and young François, at the age of nineteen, was\r\nset adrift on the world, his heart full of hope and his ambition bent\r\non Paris, whither he set his feet. Paris, however, proved a stern\r\nstepmother at the outset, as she always has been to the struggling and\r\nunsuccessful. He was obliged to tune pianos for his living, and was glad\r\nto sell his brilliant _chansons_, which afterward made a fortune for his\r\npublisher, for a few francs apiece.\r\n\r\nSeveral years of hard work and bitter privation finally culminated in\r\nthe acceptance of an opera, \"La Famille Suisse,\" at the Théâtre Faydeau\r\nin 1796, where it was given on alternate nights with Cherubini's\r\n\"Médée.\" Other operas followed in rapid succession, among which may be\r\nmentioned \"La Dot de Suzette\" (1798) and \"Le Calife de Bagdad\" (1800).\r\nThe latter of these was remarkably popular, and drew from the severe\r\nCherubim the following rebuke: \"Malheureux! Are you not ashamed of such\r\nundeserved triumph?\" Boïeldieu took the brusque criticism meekly and\r\npreferred a request for further instruction from Cherubini--a proof\r\nof modesty and good sense quite remarkable in one who had attained\r\nrecognition as a favorite with the musical public. Boïeldieu's three\r\nyears' studies under the great Italian master were of much service, for\r\nhis next work, \"Ma Tante Aurore,\" produced in 1803, showed noticeable\r\nartistic progress.\r\n\r\nIt was during this year that Boïeldieu, goaded by domestic misery\r\n(for he had married the danseuse Clotilde Mafleuray, whose notorious\r\ninfidelity made his name a byword), exiled himself to Russia, even then\r\nlooked on as an El Dorado for the musician, where he spent eight years\r\nas conductor and composer of the Imperial Opera. This was all but a\r\ntotal eclipse in his art-life, for he did little of note during the\r\nperiod of his St. Petersburg career.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Paris in 1811, where he found great changes. Méhul and\r\nCherubini, disgusted with the public, kept an obstinate silence; and\r\nNicolo was not a dangerous rival. He set to work with fresh zeal, and\r\none of his most charming works, \"Jean de Paris,\" produced in 1812, was\r\nreceived with a storm of delight. This and \"La Dame Blanche\" are the two\r\nmasterpieces of the composer in refined humor, masterly delineation,\r\nand sustained power both of melody and construction. The fourteen years\r\nwhich elapsed before Boïeldieu's genius took a still higher flight\r\nwere occupied in writing works of little value except as names in a\r\ncatalogue. The long-expected opera \"La Dame Blanche\" saw the light in\r\n1825, and it is to-day a stock opera in Europe, one Parisian theatre\r\nalone having given it nearly 2,000 times. Boïeldieu's latter years were\r\nuneventful and unfruitful. He died in 1834 of pulmonary disease, the\r\ngerms of which were planted by St. Petersburg winters. \"Jean de Paris\"\r\nand \"La Dame Blanche\" are the two works, out of nearly thirty operas,\r\nwhich the world cherishes as masterpieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nDaniel François Esprit Auber was born at Caen, Normandy, January 29,\r\n1784. He was destined by his parents for a mercantile career, and was\r\narticled to a French firm in London to perfect himself in commercial\r\ntraining. As a child he showed his passion and genius for music, a fact\r\nso noticeable in the lives of most of the great musicians. He composed\r\nballads and romances at the age of eleven, and during his London life\r\nwas much sought after as a musical prodigy alike in composition and\r\nexecution. In consequence of the breach of the treaty of Amiens in\r\n1804, he was obliged to return to Paris, and we hear no more of the\r\ncounting-room as a part of his life. His resetting of an old libretto\r\nin 1811 attracted the attention of Cherubini, who impressed himself\r\nso powerfully on French music and musicians, and the master offered to\r\nsuperintend his further studies, a chance eagerly seized by Auber. To\r\nthe instruction of Cherubini Auber owed his mastery over the technical\r\ndifficulties of his art. Among the pieces written at this time was\r\na mass for the Prince of Chimay, of which the prayer was afterward\r\ntransferred to \"Masaniello.\" The comic opera \"Le Séjour Militaire,\"\r\nproduced in 1813, when Auber was thirty, was really his début as a\r\ncomposer. It was coldly received, and it was not till the loss of\r\nprivate fortune set a sharp spur to his creative activity that he set\r\nhimself to serious work. \"La Bergère Châtelaine,\" produced in 1820,\r\nwas his first genuine success, and equal fortune attended \"Emma\" in the\r\nfollowing season.\r\n\r\nThe duration and climax of Auber's musical career were founded on his\r\nfriendship and, artistic alliance with Scribe, one of the most fertile\r\nlibrettists and playwrights of modern times. To this union, which lasted\r\ntill Scribe's death, a great number of operas, comic and serious, owe\r\ntheir existence: not all of equal value, but all evincing the apparently\r\ninexhaustible productive genius of the joint authors. The works on which\r\nAuber's claims to musical greatness rest are as follows: \"Leicester,\"\r\n1822; \"Le Maçon,\" 1825, the composer's _chef-d'ouvre_ in comic opera; \"La\r\nMuette de Portici,\" otherwise \"Masaniello,\" 1828; \"Fra Piavolo,\" 1830;\r\n\"Lestocq,\" 1835; \"Le Cheval do Ihonze,\" 1835; \"L'Ambassadrice,\" 1836;\r\n\"Le Domino Noir,\" 1837; \"Les Diamants de la Couronne,\" 1841; \"Carlo\r\nBraschi,\" 1842; \"Haydée,\" 1847; \"L'Enfant Prodigue,\" 1850; \"Zerline,\"\r\n1851, written for Madame Alboni; \"Manon Lescaut,\" 1856; \"La Fiancée du\r\nRoi de Garbe,\" 1867; \"Le Premier Jour de Bonheur,\" 1868; and \"Le Rêve\r\nd'Amour,\" 1869. The last two works were composed after Auber had passed\r\nhis eightieth year.\r\n\r\nThe indifference of this Anacreon of music to renown is worthy of\r\nremark. He never attended the performance of his own pieces, and\r\ndisdained applause. The highest and most valued distinctions were\r\nshowered on him; orders, jeweled swords, diamond snuffboxes, were poured\r\nin from all the courts of Europe. Innumerable invitations urged him to\r\nvisit other capitals, and receive honor from imperial hands. But Auber\r\nwas a true Parisian, and could not be induced to leave his beloved city.\r\nHe was a Member of the Institute, Commander of the Legion of Honor,\r\nand Cherubini's successor as Director of the Conservatory. He enjoyed\r\nperfect health up to the day of his death in 1871. Assiduous in his\r\nduties at the Conservatory, and active in his social relations, which\r\ntook him into the most brilliant circles of an extended period, covering\r\nthe reigns of Napoleon I., Charles X., Louis Philippe, and Napoleon\r\nIII., he yet always found time to devote several hours a day to\r\ncomposition. Auber was a small, delicate man, yet distinguished in\r\nappearance, and noted for wit. His _bons mots_ were celebrated. While\r\ndirecting a musical _soirée_ when over eighty, a gentleman having taken\r\na white hair from his shoulder, he said laughingly, \"This hair must\r\nbelong to some old fellow who passed near me.\"\r\n\r\nA good anecdote is told _à propos_ of an interview of Auber with Charles\r\nX. in 1830. \"Masaniello,\" a bold and revolutionary work, had just been\r\nproduced, and stirred up a powerful popular ferment. \"Ah, M. Auber,\"\r\nsaid the King, \"you have no idea of the good your work has done me.\"\r\n\"How, sire?\" \"All revolutions resemble each other. To sing one is\r\nto provoke one. What can I do to please you?\" \"Ah, sire! I am not\r\nambitious.\" \"I am disposed to name you director of the court concerts.\r\nBe sure that I shall remember you. But,\" added he, taking the artist's\r\narm with a cordial and confidential air, \"from this day forth you\r\nunderstand me well, M. Auber, I expect you to bring out the 'Muette' but\r\n_very seldom_.\" It is well known that the Brussels riots of 1830, which\r\nresulted in driving the Dutch out of the country, occurred immediately\r\nafter a performance of this opera, which thus acted the part of\r\n\"Lillibulero\" in English political annals. It is a striking coincidence\r\nthat the death of the author of this revolutionary inspiration, May 13,\r\n1871, was partly caused by the terrors of the Paris Commune.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nBoïeldieu and Auber are by far the most brilliant representatives of the\r\nFrench school of Opéra Comique. The work of the former which shows his\r\ngenius at its best is \"La Dame Blanche.\" It possesses in a remarkable\r\ndegree dramatic _verve_, piquancy of rhythm, and beauty of structure.\r\nMr. Franz Hueffer speaks of this opera as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Peculiar to Boïeldieu is a certain homely sweetness of melody which\r\nproves its kinship to that source of all truly national music, the\r\npopular song. The 'Dame Blanche' might be considered as the artistic\r\ncontinuation of the _chanson_, in the same sense as Weber's 'Der\r\nFreischtitz' has been called a dramatized _Volkslied_. With regard\r\nto Boïeldieu's work, this remark indicates at the same time a strong\r\ndevelopment of what has been described as the 'amalgamating force of\r\nFrench art and culture'; for it must be borne in mind that the subject\r\ntreated is Scotch. The plot is a compound of two of Scott's novels: the\r\n'Monastery' and 'Guy Mannering.' Julian, _alias_ George Brown, comes\r\nto his paternal castle unknown to himself. He hears the songs of his\r\nchildhood, which awaken old memories in him; but he seems doomed to\r\nmisery and disappointment, for on the day of his return his hall and\r\nhis broad acres are to become the property of a villain, the unfaithful\r\nsteward of his own family. Here is a situation full of gloom and sad\r\nforeboding. But Scribe and Boïeldieu knew better. Their hero is a\r\ndashing cavalry officer, who makes love to every pretty woman he comes\r\nacross, the 'White Lady of Avenel' among the number. Yet no one who has\r\nwitnessed the impersonation of George Brown by the great Roger can\r\nhave failed to be impressed with the grace and noble gallantry of the\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nThe tune of \"Robin Adair,\" introduced by Boïeldieu and described as \"le\r\nchant ordinaire de la tribu d'Avenel,\" would hardly be recognized by a\r\ngenuine Scotchman; but what it loses in homely vigor it has gained in\r\nsweetness. The musician's taste is always gratified in Boïeldieu's two\r\ngreat comic operas by the grace and finish of the instrumentation, and\r\nthe carefully composed _ensembles_, while the public is delighted with\r\nthe charming ballads and songs. The airs of \"La Dame Blanche\" are more\r\npopular in classic Germany than those of any other opera. Boïeldieu may\r\nthen be characterized as the composer who carried the French operetta\r\nto its highest development, and endowed it in the fullest sense with all\r\nthe grace, sparkle, dramatic symmetry, and gamesome touch so essentially\r\nthe heritage of the nation.\r\n\r\nAuber's position in art may be defined as that of the last great\r\nrepresentative of French comic opera, the legitimate successor of\r\nBoïeldieu, whom he surpasses in refinement and brilliancy of individual\r\neffects, while he is inferior in simplicity, breadth, and that firm\r\ngrasp of details which enables the composer to blend all the parts into\r\na perfect whole. In spite of the fact that \"La Muette,\" Auber's greatest\r\nopera, is a romantic and serious work, full of bold strokes of\r\ngenius that astonish no less than they please, he must be held to be\r\nessentially a master in the field of operatic comedy. In the great opera\r\nto which allusion has been made the passions of excited public feeling\r\nhave their fullest sway, and heroic sentiments of love and devotion are\r\nexpressed in a manner alike grand and original. The traditional forms\r\nof the opera are made to expand with the force of the feeling bursting\r\nthrough them. But this was the sole flight of Auber into the higher\r\nregions of his art, the offspring of the thoroughly revolutionized\r\nfeeling of the time (1828), which within two years shook Europe with\r\nsuch force. Aside from this outcome of his Berserker mood, Auber is\r\na charming exponent of the grace, brightness, and piquancy of French\r\nsociety and civilization. If rarely deep, he is never dull, and no\r\ncomposer has given the world more elegant and graceful melodies of\r\nthe kind which charm the drawing-room and furnish a good excuse for\r\nyoung-lady pianism.\r\n\r\nThe following sprightly and judicious estimate of Auber by one of the\r\nablest of modern critics, Henry Chorley, in the main lixes him in his\r\nright place:\r\n\r\n\"He falls short of his mark in situations of profound pathos (save\r\nperhaps in the sleep-song of 'Masaniello'). He is greatly behind his\r\nItalian brethren in those mad scenes which they so largely affect. He is\r\nalways light and piquant for voices, delicious in his treatment of the\r\norchestra, and at this moment of writing--though I believe the patriarch\r\nof opera-writers (born, it is said, in 1784), having begun to compose\r\nat an age when other men have died exhausted by precocious labor--is\r\nperhaps the lightest-hearted, lightest-handed man still pouring out\r\nfragments of pearl and spangles of pure gold on the stage.... With all\r\nthis it is remarkable as it is unfair, that among musicians--when\r\ntalk is going around, and this person praises that portentous piece\r\nof counterpoint, and the other analyzes some new chord the uoliness of\r\nwhich has led to its being neglected by former composers--the name of\r\nthis brilliant man is hardly if ever heard at all. His is the next name\r\namong the composers belonging to the last thirty years which should be\r\nheard after that of Rossini, the number and extent of the works produced\r\nby him taken into account, and with these the beauties which they\r\ncontain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEYERBEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nFew great names in art have been the occasion of such diversity of\r\njudgment as Giacomo Meyerbeer, whose works fill so large a place in\r\nFrench music. By one school of critics he is lauded beyond all measure\r\nas one whose scientific skill and gorgeous orchestration are only\r\nequaled by his richness of melody and genius for dramatic and scenic\r\neffects; \"by far the greatest composer of recent years;\" by another\r\nclass we hear him stigmatized as \"the very caricature of the universal\r\nMozart... the Cosmopolitan Jew, who hawks his wares among all nations\r\nindifferently, and does his best to please customers of every kind.\" The\r\ntruth lies between the two, as is wont to be the case in such extremes\r\nof opinion. Meyerbeer's remarkable talent so nearly approaches genius\r\nas to make the distinction a difficult one. He can not be numbered among\r\nthose great creative artists who by force of individuality have molded\r\nmusical epochs and left an undying imprint on their own and succeeding\r\nages. On the other hand, his remarkable power of combining the resources\r\nof the lyric stage in a grand mosaic of all that can charm the eye and\r\ncar, of wedding rich and gorgeous music with splendid spectacle, gives\r\nhim a unique place in music; for, unlike Wagner, whose ideas of stage\r\nnecessities are no less exacting, Meyerbeer aims at no reforms in lyric\r\nmusic, but only to develop the old forms to their highest degree of\r\neffect, under conditions that shall gratify the general artistic sense.\r\nTo accomplish this, he spares no means either in or out of music. Though\r\na German, there is but little of the Teutonic _genre_ in the music of\r\nWeber's fellow pupil. When at the outset he wrote for Italy, he showed\r\nbut little of that easy Assomption of the genius of Italian art which\r\nmany other foreign composers have attained. It was not till he formed\r\nhis celebrated art partnership with Scribe, the greatest of librettists,\r\nand succeeded in opening the gates of the Grand Opera of Paris with all\r\nits resources, more vast than exist anywhere else, that Meyerbeer found\r\nhis true vocation, the production of elaborate dramas in music of the\r\neclectic school. He inaugurated no clearly defined tendencies in his\r\nart; he distinctively belongs to no national school of music; but his\r\nlong and important connection with the French lyric stage classifies him\r\nunmistakably with the composers of this nation.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch belonged to a family of marked ability. Jacob\r\nBeer was a rich Jewish banker of Berlin, highly honored for his robust\r\nintellect and scholarly culture as well as his wealth. William, one of\r\nthe sons, became a distinguished astronomer; another, Michael, achieved\r\ndistinction as a dramatic poet; while the eldest, Jacob, was the\r\ncomposer, who gained his renown under the Italianized name of Giacomo\r\nMeyerbeer, a part of the surname having been adopted from that of the\r\nrich banker Meyer, who left the musician a great fortune.\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer was born at Berlin, September 5, 1794, and was a musical\r\nprodigy from his earliest years. When only four years old he would\r\nrepeat on the piano the airs he heard from the hand-organs, composing\r\nhis own accompaniment. At five he took lessons of Lanska, a pupil of\r\nClementi, and at six he made his appearance at a concert. Three years\r\nafterward the critics spoke of him as one of the best pianists in\r\nBerlin. He studied successively under the greatest masters of the time,\r\nClemcnti, Bernhard Anselm Weber, and Abbé Vogler. While in the latter's\r\nschool at Darmstadt, he had for fellow pupils Carl von Weber, Winter,\r\nand Gansbachcr. Every morning the abbé called together his pupils after\r\nmass, gave them some theoretical instruction, then assigned each one a\r\ntheme for composition. There was great emulation and friendship between\r\nMeyerbeer and Weber, which afterward cooled, however, owing to Weber's\r\ndisgust at Meyerbeer's lavish catering to an extravagant taste. Weber's\r\nsevere and bitter criticisms were not forgiven by the Franco-German\r\ncomposer.\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer's first work was the oratorio \"Gott und die Natur,\" which was\r\nperformed before the Grand Duke with such success as to gain for him\r\nthe appointment of court composer. Meyerbeer's concerts at Darmstadt\r\nand Berlin were brilliant exhibitions; and Moscheles, no mean judge, has\r\ntold us that if Meyerbeer had devoted himself to the piano, no performer\r\nin Europe could have surpassed him. By advice of Salieri, whom Meyerbeer\r\nmet in Vienna, he proceeded to Italy to study the cultivation of\r\nthe voice; for he seems in early life to have clearly recognized how\r\nnecessary it is for the operatic composer to understand this, though,\r\nin after-years, he treated the voice as ruthlessly in many of his most\r\nimportant arias and scenas as he would a brass instrument. He arrived in\r\nVienna just as the Rossini madness was at its height, and his own blood\r\nwas fired to compose operas _à la Rossini_ for the Italian theatres.\r\nSo he proceeded with prodigious industry to turn out operas. In 1818 he\r\nwrote \"Romilda e Costanza\" for Padua; in 1819, \"Semiramide\" for Turin;\r\nin 1820, \"Emma di Resburgo\" for Venice; in 1822, \"Margherita d'Anjou\"\r\nfor Milan; and in 1823, \"L'Esule di Granata,\" also for Milan. These\r\nworks of the composer's 'prentice hand met with the usual fate of the\r\nproduction of the thousand and one musicians who pour forth operas in\r\nunremitting flow for the Italian theatres; but they were excellent drill\r\nfor the future author of \"Robert le Diable\" and \"Les Huguenots.\" On\r\nreturning to Germany Meyerbeer was very sarcastically criticised on the\r\none side as a fugitive from the ranks of German music, on the other as\r\nan imitator of Rossini.\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer returned to Venice, and in 1824 brought out \"Il Crociato\r\nin Egitto\" in that city, an opera which made the tour of Europe, and\r\nestablished a reputation for the author as the coming rival of Rossini,\r\nno one suspecting from what Meyerbeer had then accomplished that he\r\nwas about to strike boldly out in a new direction. \"II Crociato\" was\r\nproduced in Paris in 1825, and the same year in London. In the latter\r\ncity, Veluti, the last of the male sopranists, was one of the principal\r\nsingers in the opera; and it was said by some of the ill-natured critics\r\nthat curiosity to see and hear this singer of a peculiar kind, of whom\r\nit was said, \"Non vir sed Veluti,\" had as much to do with the success\r\nof the opera as its merits. Lord Mount Edgcumbe, however, an excellent\r\ncritic, wrote of it \"as quite of the new school, but not copied from\r\nits founder, Rossini; original, odd, flighty, and it might be termed\r\nfantastic, but at times beautiful. Here and there most delightful\r\nmelodies and harmonies occurred, but it was unequal, solos being as rare\r\nas in all the modern operas.\" This was the last of Meyerbeer's operas\r\nwritten in the Italian style. In 1827 the composer married, and for\r\nseveral years lived a quiet, secluded life. The loss of his first two\r\nchildren so saddened him as to concentrate his attention for a while\r\non church music. During this period he composed only a \"Stabat,\" a\r\n\"Miserere,\" a \"Te Deum,\" and eight of Klopstock's songs. But he was\r\npreparing for that new departure on which his reputation as a great\r\ncomposer now rests, and which called forth such bitter condemnation\r\non the one hand, such thunders of eulogy on the other. His old fellow\r\npupil, Weber, wrote of him in after-years: \"He prostituted his profound,\r\nadmirable, and serious German talent for the applause of the crowd which\r\nhe ought to have despised.\" And Mendelssohn wrote to his father in words\r\nof still more angry disgust: \"When in 'Robert le Diable' nuns appear one\r\nafter the other and endeavor to seduce the hero, till at length the lady\r\nabbess succeeds; when the hero, aided by a magic branch, gains access\r\nto the sleeping apartment of his lady, and throws her down, forming\r\na tableau which is applauded here, and will perhaps be applauded in\r\nGermany; and when, after that, she implores for mercy in an aria; when,\r\nin another opera, a girl undresses herself, singing all the while that\r\nshe will be married to-morrow, it may be effective, but I find no\r\nmusic in it. For it is vulgar, and if such is the taste of the day, and\r\ntherefore necessary, I prefer writing sacred music.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\"Robert le Diable\" was produced at the Académie Royale in 1831, and\r\ninaugurated the brilliant reign of Dr. Véron as manager. The bold\r\ninnovations, the powerful situations, the daring methods of the\r\ncomposer, astonished and delighted Paris, and the work was performed\r\nmore than a hundred consecutive times. The history of \"Robert le Diable\"\r\nis in some respects curious. It was originally written for the Vontadour\r\nTheatre, devoted to comic opera; but the company were found unable\r\nto sing the difficult music. Meyerbeer was inspired by Weber's \"Der\r\nFreischtitz\" to attempt a romantic, semi-fantastic legendary opera, and\r\ntrod very closely in the footsteps of his model. It was determined to so\r\nalter the libretto and extend and elaborate the music as to fit it for\r\nthe stage of the Grand Opera. MM. Scribe and Delavigne, the librettists,\r\nand Meyerbeer, devoted busy days and nights to hurrying on the work. The\r\nwhole opera was remodeled, recitative substituted for dialogue, and one\r\nof the most important characters,--Rainibaud, cut out in the fourth and\r\nfifth acts--a suppression which is claimed to have befogged a very clear\r\nand intelligible plot. Highly suggestive in its present state of Weber's\r\nopera, the opera of \"Robert le Diable\" is said to have been marvelously\r\nsimilar to \"Der Freischtitz\" in the original form, though inferior in\r\ndignity of motive.\r\n\r\nParis was all agog with interest at the first production. The critics\r\nhad attended the rehearsals, and it was understood that the libretto,\r\nthe music, and the ballet were full of striking interest. Nourrit\r\nplayed the part of _Robert_; Levasseur, _Bertram_; Mme. Cinti Damoreau,\r\n_Isabelle_; and Mile. Dorus, _Alice_. The greatest dancers of the\r\nage were in the ballet and the brilliant Taglioni led the band of\r\nresuscitated nuns. Ilabeneck was conductor, and everything had been done\r\nin the way of scenery and costumes. The success was a remarkable one,\r\nand Meyerbeer's name became famous throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nDr. Véron, in his \"Mémoires d'un Bourgeois de Paris,\" describes a\r\nthrilling yet ludicrous accident that occurred on the first night's\r\nperformance. After the admirable trio, which is the _d'enoûment_ of\r\nthe work, Levasseur, who personated Bertram, sprang through the trap\r\nto rejoin the kingdom of the dead, whence he came so mysteriously.\r\n_Robert_, on the other hand, had to remain on the earth, a converted\r\nman, and destined to happiness in marriage with his princess,\r\n_Isabelle_. Nourrit, the _Robert_ of the performance, misled by the\r\nsituation and the fervor of his own feelings, threw himself into the\r\ntrap, which was not properly set. Fortunately the mattresses beneath had\r\nnot all been removed, or the tenor would have been killed, a doom which\r\nthose on the stage who saw the accident expected. The audience supposed\r\nit was part of the opera, and the people on the stage were full of\r\nterror and lamentation, when Nourrit appeared to calm their fears.\r\nMile. Dorus burst into tears of joy, and the audience, recognizing the\r\nsituation, broke into shouts of applause.\r\n\r\nThe opera was brought out in London the same year, with nearly the same\r\ncast, but did not excite so much enthusiasm as in Paris. Lord Mount\r\nEdgcumbe, who represented the connoisseurs of the old school, expressed\r\nthe then current opinion of London audiences: \"Never did I see a more\r\ndisagreeable or disgusting performance. The sight of the resurrection\r\nof a whole convent of nuns, who rise from their graves and begin dancing\r\nlike so many bacchantes, is revolting; and a sacred service in a church,\r\naccompanied by an organ on the stage, not very decorous. Neither does\r\nthe music of Meyerbeer compensate for a fable which is a tissue of\r\nnonsense and improbability.\"*\r\n\r\n     * Yet Lord Mount Edgcumbe is inconsistent enough to be an\r\n     ardent admirer of Mozart's \"Zauberflote.\"\r\n\r\nM. Véron was so delighted with the great success of \"Robert\" that he\r\nmade a contract with Meyerbeer for another grand opera, \"Les Huguenots,\"\r\nto be completed by a certain date. Meanwhile, the failing health of Mme.\r\nMeyerbeer obliged the composer to go to Italy, and work on the opera was\r\ndeferred, thus causing him to lose thirty thousand francs as the penalty\r\nof his broken contract. At length, after twenty-eight rehearsals, and\r\nan expense of more than one hundred and sixty thousand francs in\r\npreparation, \"Les Huguenots\" was given to the public, February 26, 1836.\r\nThough this great work excited transports of enthusiasm in Paris, it was\r\ninterdicted in many of the cities of Southern Europe on account of the\r\nsubject being a disagreeable one to ardent and bigoted Catholics. In\r\nLondon it has always been the most popular of Meyerbeer's three great\r\noperas, owing perhaps partly to the singing of Mario and Grisi, and more\r\nlately of Titiens and Giuglini.\r\n\r\nWhen Spontini resigned his place as chapel-master at the Court of\r\nBerlin, in 1832, Meyerbeer succeeded him. He wrote much music of an\r\naccidental character in his new position, but a slumber seems to have\r\nfallen on his greater creative faculties. The German atmosphere was not\r\nfavorable to the fruitfulness of Meyerbeer's genius. He seems to have\r\nneeded the volatile and sparkling life of Paris to excite him into full\r\nactivity. Or perhaps he was not willing to produce one of his operas,\r\nwith their large dependence on élaborât e splendor of production,\r\naway from the Paris Grand Opera. During Meyerbeer's stay in Berlin he\r\nintroduced Jenny Lind to the Berlin public, as he afterward did indeed\r\nto Paris, her _début_ there being made in the opening performance of\r\n\"Das Feldlager in Schlesien,\" afterward remodeled into \"L'Étoile du\r\nNord.\"\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer returned to Paris in 1849, to present the third of his great\r\noperas, \"Le Prophète.\" It was given with Roger, Viardot-Garcia, and\r\nCastellan in the principal characters. Mme. Viardot-Garcia achieved one\r\nof her greatest dramatic triumphs in the difficult part of _Fides_.\r\nIn London the opera also met with splendid success, having, as Chorley\r\ntells us, a great advantage over the Paris presentation in \"the\r\nremarkable personal beauty of Signor Mario, whose appearance in his\r\ncoronation robes reminded one of some bishop-saint in a picture by Van\r\nEyck or Durer, and who could bring to bear a play of feature without\r\ngrimace into the scene of false fascination, entirely beyond the reach\r\nof the clever French artist Roger, who originated the character.\"\r\n\r\n\"L'Étoile du Nord\" was given to the public February 16, 1854. Up to this\r\ntime the opera of \"Robert\" had been sung three hundred and thirty-three\r\ntimes, \"Les Huguenots\" two hundred and twenty-two, and \"Le Prophète\" a\r\nhundred and twelve. The \"Pardon de Ploërmel,\" also known as \"Dinorah,\"\r\nwas offered to the world of Paris April 4, 1859. Both these operas,\r\nthough beautiful, are inferior to his other works.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer, a man of handsome private fortune, like Mendelssohn, made\r\nlarge sums by his operas, and was probably the wealthiest of the great\r\ncomposers. He lived a life of luxurious ease, and yet labored with\r\nintense zeal a certain number of hours each day. A friend one day begged\r\nhim to take more rest, and he answered smilingly, \"If I should\r\nleave work, I should rob myself of my greatest pleasure; for I am\r\nso accustomed to work that it has become a necessity.\" Probably few\r\ncomposers have been more splendidly rewarded by contemporary fame and\r\nwealth, or been more idolized by their admirers. No less may it be said\r\nthat few have been the object of more severe criticism. His youth was\r\nspent amid the severest classic influences of German music, and the\r\nspirit of romanticism and nationality, which blossomed into such\r\nbeautiful and characteristic works as those composed by his friend\r\nand fellow pupil Weber, also found in his heart an eloquent echo. But\r\nMeyerbeer resolutely disenthralled himself from what he appeared to have\r\nregarded as trammels, and followed out an ambition to be a cosmopolitan\r\ncomposer. In pursuit of this purpose he divested himself of that fine\r\nflavor of individuality and devotion to art for its own sake which marks\r\nthe highest labors of genius. He can not be exempted from the criticism\r\nthat he regarded success and the immediate plaudits of the public as\r\nthe only satisfactory rewards of his art. He had but little of the lofty\r\ncontent which shines out through the vexed and clouded lives of\r\nsuch souls as Beethoven and Gluck in music, of Bacon and Milton in\r\nliterature, who looked forward to immortality of fame as the best\r\nvindication of their work. A marked characteristic of the man was\r\na secret dissatisfaction with all that he accomplished, making him\r\nrestless and unhappy, and extremely sensitive to criticism. With this\r\nwas united a tendency at times to oscillate to the other extreme of\r\nvaingloriousness. An example of this was a reply to Rossini one night at\r\nthe opera when they were listening to \"Robert le Diable.\" The \"Swan\r\nof Pesaro\" was a warm admirer of Meyerbeer, though the latter was a\r\nformidable rival, and his works had largely replaced those of the other\r\nin popular repute. Sitting together in the same box, Rossini, in his\r\ndelight at one portion of the opera, cried out in his impulsive Italian\r\nway, \"If you can write anything to surpass this, I will undertake to\r\ndance upon my head.\" \"Well, then,\" said Meyerbeer, \"you had better soon\r\ncommence practicing, for I have just commenced the fourth act of 'Les\r\nHuguenots.'\" Well might he make this boast, for into the fourth act of\r\nhis musical setting of the terrible St. Bartholomew tragedy he put the\r\nfinest inspirations of his life.\r\n\r\nSingular to say, though he himself represented the very opposite pole\r\nof art spirit and method, Mozart was to him the greatest of his\r\npredecessors. Perhaps it was this very fact, however, which was at the\r\nroot of his sentiment of admiration for the composer of \"Don Giovanni\"\r\nand \"Le Nozze di Figaro.\" A story is told to the effect that Meyerbeer\r\nwas once dining with some friends, when a discussion arose respecting\r\nMozart's position in the musical hierarchy. Suddenly one of the guests\r\nsuggested that \"certain beauties of Mozart's music had become stale with\r\nage. I defy you,\" he continued, \"to listen to 'Don Giovanni' after the\r\nfourth act of the 'Huguenots.'\" \"So much the worse, then, for the\r\nfourth act of the 'Huguenots,'\" said Meyerbeer, furious at the clumsy\r\ncompliment paid to his own work at the expense of his idol.\r\n\r\nCritics wedded to the strict German school of music never forgave\r\nMeyerbeer for his dereliction from the spirit and influences of his\r\nnation, and the prominence which he gave to melodramatic effects and\r\nspectacular show in his operas. Not without some show of reason, they\r\ncite this fact as proof of poverty of musical invention. Mendelssohn,\r\nwho was habitually generous in his judgment, wrote to the poet Immermann\r\nfrom Paris of \"Robert le Diable\": \"The subject is of the romantic order;\r\ni.e., the devil appears in it (which suffices the Parisians for romance\r\nand imagination). Nevertheless, it is very bad, and, were it not for\r\ntwo brilliant seduction scenes, there would, not even be effect....\r\nThe opera does not please me; it is devoid of sentiment and feeling....\r\nPeople admire the music, but where there is no warmth and truth, I can\r\nnot even form a standard of criticism.\"\r\n\r\nSchlüter, the historian of music, speaks even more bitterly of\r\nMeyerbeer's irreverence and theatric sensationalism: \"'Les Huguenots'\r\nand the far weaker production 'Le Prophète' are, we think, all the more\r\nreprehensible (nowadays especially, when too much stress is laid on\r\nthe subject of a work, and consequently on the libretto of an opera),\r\nbecause the Jew has in these pieces ruthlessly dragged before the\r\nfootlights two of the darkest pictures in the annals of Catholicism, nor\r\nhas he scrupled to bring high mass and chorale on the boards.\"\r\n\r\nWagner, the last of the great German composers, can not find words too\r\nscathing and bitter to mark his condemnation of Meyerbeer. Perhaps his\r\nextreme aversion finds its psychological reason in the circumstance that\r\nhis own early efforts were in the sphere of Meyerbeer and Halé-vy, and\r\nfrom his present point of view he looks back with disgust on what he\r\nregards as the sins of his youth. The fairest of the German estimates of\r\nthe composer, who not only cast aside the national spirit and methods,\r\nbut offended his countrymen by devoting himself to the French stage, is\r\nthat of Vischer, an eminent writer on aasthetics: \"Notwithstanding\r\nthe composer's remarkable talent for musical drama, his operas\r\ncontain sometimes too much, sometimes too little--too much in the\r\nsubject-matter, external adornment, and effective 'situations'--too\r\nlittle in the absence of poetry, ideality, and sentiment (which are\r\nessential to a work of art), as well as in the unnatural and constrained\r\ncombinations of the plot.\"\r\n\r\nBut despite the fact that Meyerbeer's operas contain such strange scenes\r\nas phantom nuns dancing, girls bathing, sunrise, skating, gunpowder\r\nexplosions, a king playing the flute, and the prima donna leading a\r\ngoat, dramatic music owes to him new accents of genuine pathos and an\r\naddition to its resources of rendering passionate emotions. Through\r\nmuch that is merely showy and meretricious there come frequent bursts of\r\ngenuine musical power and energy, which give him a high and unmistakable\r\nrank, though he has had less permanent influence in molding and\r\ndirecting the development of musical art than any other composer who has\r\nhad so large a place in the annals of his time.\r\n\r\nThe last twelve years of Meyerbeer's life were spent, with the exception\r\nof brief residences in Germany and Italy, in Paris, the city of his\r\nadoption, where all who were distinguished in art and letters paid their\r\ncourt to him. When he was seized with his fatal illness he was hard at\r\nwork on \"L'Africaine,\" for which Scribe had also furnished the libretto.\r\nHis heart was set on its completion, and his daily prayer was that his\r\nlife might be spared to finish it. But it was not to be. He died May 2,\r\n1864. The same morning Rossini called to inquire after the health of the\r\nsick man, equally his friend and rival. When he heard the sad news he\r\nsank into a fit of profound despondency and grief, from which he did not\r\nsoon recover. All Paris mourned with him, and even Germany forgot its\r\ncritical dislike to join in regret at the loss of one who, with all his\r\ndefects, was so great an artist and so good a man.\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer seems to have been greatly afraid of being buried alive. In\r\nhis pocketbook after his death was found a paper giving directions that\r\nsmall bells should be attached to his hands and feet, and that his body\r\nshould be carefully watched for four days, after which it should be sent\r\nto Berlin to be interred by the side of his mother, to whom he had been\r\nmost tenderly attached.\r\n\r\nThe composer was the intimate friend of most of the celebrities of his\r\ntime in art and literature. Victor Hugo, Lamartine, George Sand, Balzac,\r\nAlfred de Musset, Delacroix, Jules Janin, and Théophile Gautier were his\r\nfamiliar intimates; and the reunions between these and other gifted\r\nmen, who then made Paris so intellectually brilliant, are charmingly\r\ndescribed by Liszt and Moscheles. Meyerbeer's correspondence, which was\r\nextensive, deserves publication, as it displays marked literary faculty,\r\nand is full of bright sympathetic thought, vigorous criticism, and\r\nplayful fancy. The following letter to Jules Janin, written from Berlin\r\na few years before his death, gives some pleasant insight into his\r\ncharacter:\r\n\r\nYour last letter was addressed to me at Konigsberg; but I was in Berlin\r\nworking--working away like a young man, despite my seventy years, which\r\nsomehow certain people, with a peculiar generosity, try to put upon me.\r\nAs I am not at Konigsberg, where I am to arrange for the Court concert\r\nfor the eighteenth of this month, I have now leisure to answer\r\nyour letter, and will immediately confess to you how greatly I was\r\ndisappointed that you were so little interested in Rameau; and yet\r\nRameau was always the bright star of your French opera, as well as your\r\nmaster in the music. He remained to you after Lulli, and it was he who\r\nprepared the way for the Chevalier Gluck: therefore his family have a\r\nright to expect assistance from the Parisians, who on several occasions\r\nhave cared for the descendants of Racine and the grandchildren of the\r\ngreat Corneille. If I had been in Paris, I certainly would have given\r\ntwo hundred francs for a seat; and I take this opportunity to beg you\r\nto hand that sum to the poor family, who can not fail to be unhappy in\r\ntheir disappointment. At the same time I send you a power of attorney\r\nfor M. Guyot, by which I renounce all claims to the parts of my\r\noperas which may be represented at the benefit for the celebrated and\r\nunfortunate Rameau family. Why will you not come to Konigsberg at the\r\nfestival? Why, in other words, are you not in Berlin? What splendid\r\nmusic we have in preparation! As to myself, it is not only a source of\r\npleasure to me, but I feel it a duty, in the position I hold, to compose\r\na grand march, to be performed at Konigsberg while the royal procession\r\npasses from the castle into the church, where the ceremony of crowning\r\nis to take place. I will even compose a hymn, to be executed on the day\r\nthat our king and master returns to his good Berlin. Besides, I have\r\npromised to write an overture for the great concert of the four nations,\r\nwhich the directors of the London exhibition intend to give at the\r\nopening of the same, next spring, in the Crystal Palace. All this keeps\r\nme back: it has robbed me of my autumn, and will also take a good part\r\nof next spring; but with the help of God, dear friend, I hope we shall\r\nsee each other again next year, free from all cares, in the charming\r\nlittle town of Spa, listening to the babbling of its waters and the\r\nrustling of its old gray oaks. Truly your friend, Meyerbeer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer's operas are so intricate in their elements, and travel so far\r\nout of the beaten track of precedent and rule, that it is difficult to\r\nclearly describe their characteristics in a few words. His original\r\nflow of melody could not have been very rich, for none of his tunes have\r\nbecome household words, and his excessive use of that element of opera\r\nwhich has nothing to do with music, as in the case of Wagner, can have\r\nbut one explanation. It is in the treatment of the orchestra that he\r\nhas added most largely to the genuine treasures of music. His command of\r\ncolor in tone-painting and power of dramatic suggestion have rarely been\r\nequaled, and never surpassed. His genius for musical rhythm is the most\r\nmarked element in his power. This is specially noticeable in his dance\r\nmusic, which is very bold, brilliant, and voluptuous. The vivacity\r\nand grace of the ballets in his operas save more than one act which\r\notherwise would be insufferably heavy and tedious. It is not too much\r\nto say that the most spontaneous side of his creative fancy is found in\r\nthese affluent, vigorous, and stirring measures.\r\n\r\nMeyerbeer appears always to have been uncertain of himself and his work.\r\nThere was little of that masterly prevision of effect in his mind which\r\nis one of the attributes of the higher imagination. His operas, though\r\nmost elaborately constructed, were often entirely modified and changed\r\nin rehearsal, and some of the finest scenes both in the dramatic and\r\nmusical sense were the outcome of some happy accidental suggestion at\r\nthe very last moment. \"Robert,\" \"Les Huguenots,\" \"Le Prophète,\" in the\r\nforms we have them, are quite different from those in which they\r\nwere first cast. These operas have therefore been called \"the most\r\nmagnificent patchwork in the history of art,\" though this is a harsh\r\nphrasing of the fact, which somewhat outrides justice. Certain it\r\nis, however, that Meyerbeer was largely indebted to the chapter of\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Véron, who was manager of the Grand Opera during\r\nthe most of the composer's brilliant career, is of great interest, as\r\nillustrating this trait of Meyerbeer's composition. He tells us in his\r\n\"Mémoires,\" before alluded to, that \"Robert\" was made and remade\r\nbefore its final production. The ghastly but effective color of the\r\nresuscitation scene in the graveyard of the ruined convent was a\r\nchange wrought by a stage manager, who was disgusted with the chorus of\r\nsimpering women in the original. This led Meyerbeer to compose the\r\nweird ballet music which is such a characteristic feature of \"Robert le\r\nDiable.\" So, too, we are told on the same authority, the fourth act of\r\n\"Les Huguenots,\" which is the most powerful single act in Meyerbeer's\r\noperas, owes its present shape to Nourrit, the most intellectual and\r\ncreative tenor singer of whom we have record. It was originally\r\ndesigned that the St. Bartholomew massacre should be organized by _Queen\r\nMarguerite_, but Nourrit pointed out that the interest centering in the\r\nheroine, Valentine, as an involuntary and horrified witness, would be\r\nimpaired by the predominance of another female character. So the plot\r\nwas largely reconstructed, and fresh music written. Another still more\r\nstriking attraction was the addition of the great duet with which\r\nthe act now closes--a duet which critics have cited as an evidence\r\nof unequaled power, coming as it does at the very heels of such an\r\nastounding chorus as \"The Blessing of the Swords.\" Nourrit felt that\r\nthe parting of the two lovers at such a time and place demanded such an\r\noutburst and confession as would be wrung from them by the agony of\r\nthe situation. Meyerbeer acted on the suggestion with such felicity and\r\nforce as to make it the crowning beauty of the work. Similar changes\r\nare understood to have been made in \"Le Prophète\" by advice of Nourrit,\r\nwhose poetical insight seems to have been unerring. It was left to\r\nDuprez, Nourrit's successor, however, to be the first exponent of _John\r\nof Leyden_.\r\n\r\nThese instances suffice to show how uncertain and unequal was the grasp\r\nof Meyerbeer's genius, and to explain in part why he was so prone to\r\ngorgeous effects, aside from that tendency of the Israelitish nature\r\nwhich delights in show and glitter. We see something in it akin to the\r\ntrick of the rhetorician, who seeks to hide poverty of thought under\r\nglittering phrases. Yet Meyerbeer rose to occasions with a force that\r\nwas something gigantic. Once his work was clearly defined in a mind not\r\npowerfully creative, he expressed it in music with such vigor, energy,\r\nand warmth of color as can not be easily surpassed. With this composer\r\nthere was but little spontaneous flow of musical thought, clothing\r\nitself in forms of unconscious and perfect beauty, as in the case of\r\nMozart, Beethoven, Cherubini, Rossini, and others who could be cited.\r\nThe constitution of his mind demanded some external power to bring forth\r\nthe gush of musical energy.\r\n\r\nThe operas of Meyerbeer may be best described as highly artistic and\r\nfinished mosaic work, containing much that is precious with much that is\r\nfalse. There are parts of all his operas which can not be surpassed\r\nfor beauty of music, dramatic energy, and fascination of effect. In\r\naddition, the strength and richness of his orchestration, which contains\r\noriginal strokes not found in other composers, give him a lasting claim\r\non the admiration of the lovers of music. No other composer has united\r\nso many glaring defects with such splendid power; and were it not that\r\nMeyerbeer strained his ingenuity to tax the resources of the singer\r\nin every possible way, not even the mechanical difficulty of producing\r\nthese operas in a fashion commensurate with their plan would prevent\r\ntheir taking a high place among popular operas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOUNOD AND THOMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nMoscheles, one of the severe classical pianists of the German school,\r\nwrites as follows in 1861 in a letter to a friend: \"In Gounod I hail a\r\nreal composer. I have heard his 'Faust' both at Leipsic and Dresden, and\r\nam charmed with that refined, piquant music. Critics may rave if they\r\nlike against the mutilation of Goethe's masterpiece; the opera is sure\r\nto attract, for it is a fresh, interesting work, with a copious flow of\r\nmelody and lovely instrumentation.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Chorley in his \"Thirty Years' Musical Recollections,\" writing of\r\nthe year 1851, says: \"To a few hearers, since then grown into a European\r\npublic, neither the warmest welcome nor the most bleak indifference\r\ncould alter the conviction that among the composers who have appeared\r\nduring the last twenty-five years, M. Gounod was the most promising one,\r\nas showing the greatest combination of sterling science, beauty of idea,\r\nfreshness of fancy, and individuality. Before a note of 'Sappho' was\r\nwritten, certain sacred Roman Catholic compositions and some exquisite\r\nsettings of French verse had made it clear to some of the acutest judges\r\nand profoundest musicians living, that in him at last something true and\r\nnew had come--may I not say, the most poetical of French musicians that\r\nhas till now written?\" The same genial and acute critic, in further\r\ndiscussing the envy, jealousy, and prejudice that Gounod awakened in\r\ncertain musical quarters, writes in still more decided strains: \"The\r\nfact has to be swallowed and digested that already the composer of\r\n'Sappho,' the choruses to 'Ulysse,' 'Le Médecin malgré lui,' 'Faust,'\r\n'Philemon et Baucis,' a superb Cecilian mass, two excellent symphonies,\r\nand half a hundred songs and romances, which may be ranged not far from\r\nSchubert's and above any others existing in France, is one of the very\r\nfew individuals left to whom musical Europe is now looking for its\r\npleasure.\" Surely it is enough praise for a great musician that, in the\r\ndomain of opera, church music, symphony, and song, he has risen above\r\nall others of his time in one direction, and in all been surpassed by\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nIt was not till \"Faust\" was produced that Gounod's genius evinced its\r\nhighest capacity. For nineteen years the exquisite melodies of this\r\ngreat work have rung in the ears of civilization without losing one whit\r\nof the power with which they first fascinated the lovers of music. The\r\nverdict which the aged Moscheles passed in his Leipsic home--Moscheles,\r\nthe friend of Beethoven, Weber, Schumann, and Mendelssohn; which was\r\nreechoed by the patriarchal Rossini, who came from his Passy retirement\r\nto offer his congratulations; which Auber took up again, as with tears\r\nof joy in his eyes he led Gounod, the ex-pupil of the Conservatory,\r\nthrough the halls wherein had been laid the foundation of his musical\r\nskill--that verdict has been affirmed over and over again by the world.\r\nFor in \"Faust\" we recognize not only some of the most noble music ever\r\nwritten, but a highly dramatic expression of spiritual truth. It is\r\nhardly a question that Gounod has succeeded in an unrivaled degree in\r\nexpressing the characters and symbolisms of _Mephistopheles, Faust,\r\nand Gretchen_ in music not merely beautiful, but spiritual, humorous,\r\nsubtile, and voluptuous, accordingly as the varied meanings of Goethe's\r\nmasterpiece demand.\r\n\r\nVisitors at Paris, while the American civil war was at its height, might\r\nfrequently have observed at the beautiful Theatre Lyrique, afterward\r\nburned by the Vandals of the Commune, a noticeable-looking man, of\r\nblonde complexion and tawny beard, clear-cut features, and large,\r\nbright, almost somber-looking eyes. As the opera of \"Faust\" progresses,\r\nhis features eloquently express his varying emotions, now of approval,\r\nnow of annoyance at different parts of the performance. M. Gounod is\r\ncriticising the interpretation of the great opera, which suddenly lifted\r\nhim into fame as perhaps the most imaginative and creative of late\r\ncomposers.\r\n\r\nAn aggressive disposition, an energy and faith that accepted no rebuffs,\r\nand the power of \"toiling terribly,\" had enabled Gounod to battle his\r\nway into the front rank. Unlike Rossini and Auber, he disdained social\r\nrecreation, and was so rarely seen in the fashionable quarters of Paris\r\nand London that only an occasional musical announcement kept him before\r\nthe eyes of the public. Gounod seems to have devoted himself to the\r\nstrict sphere of his art-life with an exclusive devotion quite foreign\r\nto the general temperament of the musician, into which something\r\nluxurious and pleasure-loving is so apt to enter. This composer,\r\nstanding in the very front rank of his fellows, has injected into the\r\nveins of the French school to which he belongs a seriousness, depth, and\r\nimaginative vigor, which prove to us how much he is indebted to German\r\ninspiration and German models.\r\n\r\nCharles Gounod, born in Paris June 17, 1818, betrayed so much\r\npassion for music during tender years, that his father gave him every\r\nopportunity to gratify and improve this marked bias. He studied under\r\nReicha and Le Sueur, and finally under Halévy, completing under\r\nthe latter the preparation which fitted him for entrance into the\r\nConservatory. The talents he displayed there were such as to fix on\r\nhim the attention of his most distinguished masters. He carried off the\r\nsecond prize at nineteen, and at twenty-one received the grand prize for\r\nmusical composition awarded by the French Institute. His first published\r\nwork was a mass performed at the Church of St. Eustache, which, while\r\nnot specially successful, was sufficiently encouraging to both the young\r\ncomposer and his friends.\r\n\r\nGounod now proceeded to Rome, where there seems to have been some\r\ninclination on his part to study for holy orders. But music was not\r\ndestined to be cheated of so gifted a votary. In 1841 he wrote a second\r\nmass, which was so well thought of in the papal capital as to gain for\r\nthe young composer the appointment of an honorary chapel-master for\r\nlife. This recognition of his genius settled his final conviction that\r\nmusic was his true life-work, though the religious sentiment, or\r\nrather a sympathy with mysticism, is strikingly apparent in all of his\r\ncompositions. The next goal in the composer's art pilgrimage was the\r\nmusic-loving city of Vienna, the home of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and\r\nSchubert, though its people waited till the last three great geniuses\r\nwere dead before it accorded them the loving homage which they have\r\nsince so freely rendered. The reception given by the capricious Viennese\r\nto a requiem and a Lenten mass (for as yet Gounod only thought of sacred\r\nmusic as his vocation) was not such as to encourage a residence. Paris,\r\nthe queen of the world, toward which every French exile ever looks with\r\nlonging eyes, seemed to beckon him back; so at the age of twenty-five\r\nhe turned his steps again to his beloved Lutetia. His education was\r\nfinished; he had completed his _Wanderjahre_; and he was eager to enter\r\non the serious work of life.\r\n\r\nHe was appointed chapelmaster at the Church of Foreign Missions, in\r\nwhich office he remained for six years, in the mean while marrying\r\na charming woman, the daughter of Herr Zimmermann, the celebrated\r\ntheologian and orator. In 1849 he composed his third mass, which made a\r\npowerful impression on musicians and critics, though Gounod's ambition,\r\nwhich seems to have been powerfully stimulated by his marriage, began\r\nto realize that it was in the field of lyric drama only that his powers\r\nwould find their full development. He had been an ardent student in\r\nliterature and art as well as in music; his style had been formed on the\r\nmost noble and serious German models, and his tastes, awakened into full\r\nactivity, carried him with great zeal into the loftier field of operatic\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nThe dominating influence of Gluck, so potent in shaping the tastes and\r\nmethods of the more serious French composers, asserted itself from the\r\nbeginning in the work of Gounod, and no modern composer has been so\r\nbrilliant and effective a disciple in carrying out the formulas of\r\nthat great master. More free, flexible, and melodious than Spontini and\r\nHalévy, measuring his work by a conception of art more lofty and ideal\r\nthan that of Meyerbeer, and in creative power and originality by far\r\ntheir superior, Gounod's genius, as shown in the one opera of \"Faust,\"\r\nsuffices to stamp his great mastership.\r\n\r\nBut he had many years of struggle yet before this end was to be\r\nachieved. His early lyric compositions fell dead. Score after score was\r\nrejected by the managers. No one cared to hazard the risk of producing\r\nan opera by this unknown composer. His first essay was a pastoral opera,\r\n\"Philemon and Baucis,\" and it did not escape from the manuscript for\r\nmany a long year, though it has in more recent times been received by\r\ncritical German audiences with great applause. A catalogue of Gounod's\r\nfailures would have no significance except as showing that his industry\r\nand energy were not relaxed by public neglect. His first decided\r\nencouragement came in 1851, when \"Sappho\" was produced at the French\r\nOpera through the influence of Madame Pauline Viardot, the sister of\r\nMalibran, who had a generous belief in the composer's future, and such\r\na position in the musical world of Paris as to make her requests almost\r\nmandatory. This opera, based on the fine poem of Emile Augier, was well\r\nreceived, and cheered Gounod's heart to make fresh efforts. In 1852\r\nhe composed the choruses for Poussard's classical tragedy of \"Ulysse,\"\r\nperformed at the Theatre Français. The growing recognition of the world\r\nwas evidenced in his appointment as director of the Normal Singing\r\nSchool of Paris, the primary school of the Conservatory. In 1854 a\r\nfive-act opera, with a libretto from the legend of the \"Bleeding Nun,\"\r\nwas completed and produced, and Gounod was further gratified to see that\r\nmusical authorities were willing to grant him a distinct place in the\r\nranks of art, though as yet not a very high one.\r\n\r\nFor years Gounod's serious and elevated mind had been pondering on\r\nGoethe's great poem as the subject of an opera, and there is reason to\r\nconjecture that parts of it were composed and arranged, if not fully\r\nelaborated, long prior to its final crystallization. But he was not yet\r\nquite ready to enter seriously on the composition of the masterpiece.\r\nHe must still try his hand on lesser themes. Occasional pieces for the\r\norchestra or choruses strengthened his hold on these important elements\r\nof lyric composition, and in 1858 he produce \"Le Médecin malgré lui,\"\r\nbased on Molière's comedy, afterward performed as an English opera under\r\nthe title of \"The Mock Doctor.\" Gounod's genius seems to have had no\r\naffinity for the graceful and sparkling measures of comic music, and\r\nhis attempt to rival Rossini and Auber in the field where they were\r\npreeminent was decidedly unsuccessful, though the opera contained much\r\nfine music.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe year of his triumph had at last arrived. He had waited and toiled\r\nfor years over \"Faust,\" and it was now ready to flash on the world with\r\nan electric brightness that was to make his name instantly famous.\r\nOne day saw him an obscure, third-rate composer, the next one of the\r\nbrilliant names in art. \"Faust,\" first performed March 19, 1859, fairly\r\ntook the world by storm. Gounod's warmest friends were amazed by\r\nthe beauty of the masterpiece, in which exquisite melody, great\r\norchestration, and a dramatic passion never surpassed in operatic art,\r\nwere combined with a scientific skill and precision which would vie\r\nwith that of the great masters of harmony. Carvalho, the manager of the\r\nTheatre Lyrique, had predicted that the work would have a magnificent\r\nreception by the art world, and lavished on it every stage resource.\r\nMadame Miolan-Carvalho, his brilliant wife, one of the leading sopranos\r\nof the day, sang the rôle of the heroine, though five years afterward\r\nshe was succeeded by Nilsson, who invested the part with a poetry and\r\ntenderness which have never been quite equaled.\r\n\r\n\"Faust\" was received at Berlin, Vienna, Milan, St. Petersburg, and\r\nLondon, with an enthusiasm not less than that which greeted its Parisian\r\ndébut. The clamor of dispute between the different schools was for the\r\nmoment hushed in the delight with which the musical critics and public\r\nof universal Europe listened to the magical measures of an opera which\r\nto classical chasteness and severity of form and elevation of motive\r\nunited such dramatic passion, richness of melody, and warmth of\r\norchestral color. From that day to the present \"Faust\" has retained its\r\nplace as not only the greatest but the most popular of modern operas.\r\nThe proof of the composer's skill and sense of symmetry in the\r\ncomposition of \"Faust\" is shown in the fact that each part is so nearly\r\nnecessary to the work, that but few \"cuts\" can be made in presentation\r\nwithout essentially marring the beauty of the work; and it is therefore\r\ngiven with close faithfulness to the author's score.\r\n\r\nAfter the immense success of \"Faust,\" the doors of the Academy were\r\nopened wide to Gounod. On February 28, 1862, the \"Reine de Saba\" was\r\nproduced, but was only a _succès d'estime_, the libretto by Gérard de\r\nNerval not being fitted for a lyric tragedy.*\r\n\r\n     * It has been a matter of frequent comment by the ablest\r\n     musical critics that many noble operas, now never heard,\r\n     would have retained their place in the repertoires of modern\r\n     dramatic music, had it not been for the utter rubbish to\r\n     which the music has been set.\r\n\r\nMany numbers of this fine work, however, are still favorites on concert\r\nprogrammes, and it has been given in English under the name of \"Irene.\"\r\nGounod's love of romantic themes, and the interest in France which\r\nLamartine's glowing eulogies had excited about \"Mireio,\" the beautiful\r\nnational poem of the Provençal, M. Frederic Mistral, led the former to\r\ncompose an opera on a libretto from this work, which was given at the\r\nThéâtre Lyrique, March 19, 1864, under the name of \"Mireille.\" The\r\nmusic, however, was rather descriptive and lyric than dramatic, as\r\nbefitted this lovely ideal of early French provincial life; and in spite\r\nof its containing some of the most captivating airs ever written,\r\nand the fine interpretation of the heroine by Miolan-Carvalho, it was\r\naccepted with reservations. It has since become more popular in\r\nits three-act form to which it was abridged. It is a tribute to the\r\nessential beauty of Gounod's music that, however unsuccessful as operas\r\ncertain of his works have been, they have all contributed charming\r\n_morceaux_ for the enjoyment of concert audiences. Not only did the airs\r\nof \"Mireille\" become public favorites, but its overture is frequently\r\ngiven as a distinct orchestral work.\r\n\r\nThe opera of \"La Colombe,\" known in English as \"The Pet Dove,\" followed\r\nin 1866; and the next year was produced the five-act opera of \"Roméo\r\net Juliette,\" of which the principal part was again taken by Madame\r\nMiolan-Carvalho. The favorite pieces in this work, which is a highly\r\npoetic rendering of Shakespeare's romantic tragedy, are the song of\r\n_Queen Mab_, the garden duet, a short chorus in the second act, and\r\nthe duel scene in the third act. For some occult reason, \"Roméo et\r\nJuliette,\" though recognized as a work of exceptional beauty and merit,\r\nand still occasionally performed, has no permanent hold on the operatic\r\npublic of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe evils that fell on France from the German war and the horrors of the\r\nCommune drove Gounod to reside in London, unlike Auber, who resolutely\r\nrefused to forsake the city of his love, in spite of the suffering and\r\nprivation which he foresaw, and which were the indirect cause of the\r\nveteran composer's death. Gounod remained several years in England, and\r\nlived a retired life, seemingly as if he shrank from public notice\r\nand disdained public applause. His principal appearances were at the\r\nPhilharmonic, the Crystal Palace, and at Mrs. Weldon's concerts, where\r\nhe directed the performances of his own compositions. The circumstances\r\nof his London residence seem to have cast a cloud over Gounod's life\r\nand to have strangely unsettled his mind. Patriotic grief probably had\r\nsomething to do with this at the outset. But even more than this as\r\na source of permanent irritation may be reckoned the spell cast over\r\nGounod's mind by a beautiful adventuress, who was ambitious to attain\r\nsocial and musical recognition through the _éclat_ of the great\r\ncomposer's friendship. Though newspaper report may be credited with\r\nswelling and distorting the naked facts, enough appears to be known to\r\nmake it sure that the evil genius of Gounod's London life was a woman,\r\nwho traded recklessly with her own reputation and the French composer's\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nHowever untoward the surroundings of Gounod, his genius did not lie\r\naltogether dormant during this period of friction and fretfulness,\r\nconditions so repressive to the best imaginative work. He composed\r\nseveral masses and other church music; a \"Stabat Mater\" with orchestra;\r\nthe oratorio of \"Tobie\"; \"Gallia,\" a lamentation for France; incidental\r\nmusic for Legouvé's tragedy of \"Les Deux Reines,\" and for Jules\r\nBarbier's \"Jeanne d'Arc\"; a large number of songs and romances, both\r\nsacred and secular, such as \"Nazareth,\" and \"There is a Green Hill\";\r\nand orchestral works, a \"Salterello in A,\" and the \"Funeral March of a\r\nMarionette.\"\r\n\r\nAt last he broke loose from the bonds of Delilah, and, remembering that\r\nhe had been elected to fill the place of Clapisson in the Institute,\r\nhe returned to Paris in 1876 to resume the position which his genius\r\nso richly deserved. On the 5th of March of the following year his\r\n\"Cinq-Mars\" was brought out at the Theatre de l'Opéra Comique; but\r\nit showed the traces of the haste and carelessness with which it was\r\nwritten, and therefore commanded little more than a respectful hearing.\r\nHis last opera, \"Polyeucte,\" produced at the Grand Opera, October 7,\r\n1878, though credited with much beautiful music, and nobly orchestrated,\r\nis not regarded by the French critics as likely to add anything to the\r\nreputation of the composer of \"Faust.\" Gounod, now at the age of sixty,\r\nif we judge him by the prolonged fertility of so many of the great\r\ncomposers, may be regarded as not having largely passed the prime of\r\nhis powers. The world still has a right to expect much from his genius.\r\nConceded even by his opponents to be a great musician and a thorough\r\nmaster of the orchestra, more generous critics in the main agree to rank\r\nGounod as the most remarkable contemporary composer, with the possible\r\nexception of Richard Wagner. The distinctive trait of his dramatic\r\nconceptions seems to be an imagination hovering between sensuous images\r\nand mystic dreams. Originally inspired by the severe Greek sculpture\r\nof Gluck's music, he has applied that master's laws in the creation of\r\ntone-pictures full of voluptuous color, but yet solemnized at times by\r\nan exaltation which recalls the time when as a youth he thought of the\r\nspiritual dignity of the priesthood. The use he makes of his religious\r\nreminiscences is familiarly illustrated in \"Faust.\" The contrast between\r\ntwo opposing principles is marked in all of Gounod's dramatic works, and\r\nin \"Faust\" this struggle of \"a soul which invades mysticism and which\r\nstill seeks to express voluptuousness\" not only colors the music with a\r\nnovel fascination, but amounts to an interesting psychological problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nGounod's genius fills too large a space in contemporary music to be\r\npassed over without a brief special study. In pursuit of this no better\r\nmethod suggests itself than an examination of the opera of \"Faust,\" into\r\nwhich the composer poured the finest inspirations of his life, even\r\nas Goethe embodied the sum and flower of his long career, which had\r\ngarnered so many experiences, in his poetic masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe story of \"Faust\" has tempted many composers. Prince Radziwill tried\r\nit, and then Spohr set a version of the theme at once coarse and cruel,\r\nfull of vulgar witchwork and love-making only fit for a chambermaid.\r\nSince then Schumann, Liszt, Wagner, and Berlioz have treated the story\r\norchestrally with more or less success. Gounod's treatment of the poem\r\nis by far the most intelligible, poetic, and dramatic ever attempted,\r\nand there is no opera since the days of Gluck with so little weak music,\r\nexcept Beethoven's \"Fidelio.\"\r\n\r\nIn the introduction the restless gloom of the old philospher and the\r\ncontrasted joys of youth engaged in rustic revelry outside are expressed\r\nwith graphic force; and the Kirmes music in the next act is so quaint\r\nand original, as well as melodious, as to give the sense of delightful\r\ncomedy. When _Marguerite_ enters on the scene, we have a waltz and\r\nchorus of such beauty and piquancy as would have done honor to Mozart.\r\nIndeed, in the dramatic use of dance music Gounod hardly yields in\r\nskill and originality to Meyerbeer himself, though the latter composer\r\nspecially distinguished himself in this direction. The third and fourth\r\nacts develop all the tenderness and passion of _Marguerite's_ character,\r\nall the tragedy of her doom.\r\n\r\nAfter _Faust's_ beautiful monologue in the garden come the song of the\r\n\"King of Thule\" and _Marguerites_ delight at finding the jewels, which\r\nconjoined express the artless vanity of the child in a manner alike full\r\nof grace and pathos. The quartet that follows is one of great beauty,\r\nthe music of each character being thoroughly in keeping, while the\r\nadmirable science of the composer blends all into thorough artistic\r\nunity. It is hardly too much to assert that the love scene which closes\r\nthis act has nothing to surpass it for fire, passion, and tenderness,\r\nseizing the mind of the hearer with absorbing force by its suggestion\r\nand imagery, while the almost cloying sweetness of the melody is such\r\nas Rossini and Schubert only could equal. The full confession of the\r\nenamored pair contained in the brief _adagio_ throbs with such rapture\r\nas to find its most suggestive parallel in the ardent words commencing\r\n\"Gallop apace, ye fiery-looted steeds,\" placed by Shakespeare in the\r\nmouth of the expectant _Juliet_.\r\n\r\nBeauties succeed each other in swift and picturesque succession, fitting\r\nthe dramatic order with a nicety which forces the highest praise of\r\nthe critic. The march and chorus marking the return of _Valentine's_\r\nregiment beat with a fire and enthusiasm to which the tramp of\r\nvictorious squadrons might well keep step. The wicked music of\r\n_Mephistopheles_ in the sarcastic serenade, the powerful duel trio, and\r\n_Valentine's_ curse are of the highest order of expression; while the\r\nchurch scene, where the fiend whispers his taunts in the ear of the\r\ndisgraced _Marguerite_, as the gloomy musical hymn and peals of the\r\norgan menace her with an irreversible doom, is a weird and thrilling\r\npicture of despair, agony, and devilish exultation.\r\n\r\nGounod has been blamed for violating the reverence due to sacred things,\r\nemploying portions of the church service in this scene, instead of\r\nwriting music for it. But this is the last resort of critical hostility,\r\nseeking a peg on which to hang objection. Meyerbeer's splendid\r\nintroduction of Luther's great hymn, \"Ein' feste Burg,\" in \"Les\r\nHuguenots,\" called forth a similar criticism from his German assailants.\r\nSome of the most dramatic effects in music have been created by this\r\nspecies of musical quotation, so rich in its appeal to memory and\r\nassociation. Who that has once heard can forget the thrilling power of\r\n\"La Marseillaise\" in Schumann's setting of Heinrich Heine's poem of \"The\r\nTwo Grenadiers\"? The two French soldiers, weary and broken-hearted after\r\nthe Russian campaign, approach the German frontier. The veterans are\r\nmoved to tears as they think of their humiliated Emperor. Up speaks one\r\nsuffering with a deadly hurt to the other: \"Friend, when I am dead,\r\nbury me in my native France, with my cross of honor on my breast, and\r\nmy musket in my hand, and lay my good sword by my side.\" Until this time\r\nthe melody has been a slow and dirge-like stave in the minor key. The\r\nold soldier declares his belief that he will rise again from the clods\r\nwhen he hears the victorious tramp of his Emperor's squadrons passing\r\nover his grave, and the minor breaks into a weird setting of the\r\n\"Marseillaise\" in the major key. Suddenly it closes with a few solemn\r\nchords, and, instead of the smoke of battle and the march of the phantom\r\nhost, the imagination sees the lonely plain with its green mounds and\r\nmoldering crosses.\r\n\r\nReaders will pardon this digression illustrating an artistic law, of\r\nwhich Gounod has made such effective use in the church scene of his\r\n\"Faust\" in heightening its tragic solemnity. The wild goblin symphony\r\nin the fifth act has added some new effects to the gamut of deviltry in\r\nmusic, and shows that Weber in the \"Wolf's Glen\" and Meyerbeer in the\r\n\"Cloisters of St. Rosalie\" did not exhaust the somewhat limited field.\r\nThe whole of this part of the act, sadly mutilated and abridged often\r\nin representation, is singularly picturesque and striking as a musical\r\nconception, and is a fitting companion to the tragic prison scene.\r\nThe despair of the poor crazed _Marguerite_; her delirious joy in\r\nrecognizing _Faust_; the temptation to fly; the final outburst of faith\r\nand hope, as the sense of Divine pardon sinks into her soul--all these\r\nare touched with the fire of genius, and the passion sweeps with an\r\nunfaltering force to its climax. These references to the details of a\r\nwork so familiar as \"Faust,\" conveying of course no fresh information to\r\nthe reader, have been made to illustrate the peculiarities of Gounod's\r\nmusical temperament, which sways in such fascinating contrast between\r\nthe voluptuous and the spiritual. But whether his accents belong to\r\nthe one or the other, they bespeak a mood flushed with earnestness and\r\nfervor, and a mind which recoils from the frivolous, however graceful it\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\nIn the Franco-German school, of which Gounod is so high an exponent, the\r\norchestra is busy throughout developing the history of the emotions, and\r\nin \"Faust\" especially it is as busy a factor in expressing the passions\r\nof the characters as the vocal parts. Not even in the \"garden scene\"\r\ndoes the singing reduce the instruments to a secondary importance. The\r\ndifference between Gounod and Wagner, who professes to elaborate the\r\nimportance of the orchestra in dramatic music, is that the former has a\r\nskill in writing for the voice which the other lacks. The one lifts the\r\nvoice by the orchestration, the other submerges it. Gounod's affluence\r\nof lovely melody can only be compared with that of Mozart and Rossini,\r\nand his skill and ingenuity in treating the orchestra have wrung\r\nreluctant praise from his bitterest opponents.\r\n\r\nThe special power which makes Gounod unique in his art, aside from those\r\nelements before alluded to as derived from temperament, is his unerring\r\nsense of dramatic fitness, which weds such highly suggestive music\r\nto each varying phase of character and action. To this perhaps one\r\nexception may be made. While he possesses a certain airy playfulness,\r\nhe fails in rich broad humor utterly, and situations of comedy are by no\r\nmeans so well handled as the more serious scenes.\r\n\r\nA good illustration of this may be found in \"Le Médecin malgré lui,\"\r\nin the couplets given to the drunken _Sganarelle_. They are beautiful\r\nmusic, but utterly unflavored with the _vis comica_.\r\n\r\nHad Gounod written only \"Faust,\" it should stamp him as one of the\r\nmost highly gifted composers of his age. Noticeably in his other works,\r\npreeminently in this, he has shown a melodic freshness and fertility,\r\na mastery of musical form, a power of orchestration, and a dramatic\r\nenergy, which are combined to the same degree in no one of his rivals.\r\nTherefore it is just to place him in the first rank of contemporary\r\ncomposers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nAmong contemporary French composers there is no name which suggests\r\nitself in comparison with that of Gounod so worthily as that of Ambroise\r\nThomas, famous in every country where the opera is a favorite form of\r\npublic amusement, as the author of \"Mignon\" and \"Hamlet.\" Lacking the\r\ndepth and passion of Gounod, he is distinguished by a peculiar sparkle,\r\ngrace, and Gallic lightness of touch; and if we do not find in him the\r\nearnestness and spiritual significance of his rival's conceptions,\r\nthere is, on the other hand, in the works of Thomas, a glow of poetic\r\nsentiment which invests them with a charming atmosphere, peculiarly\r\ntheir own. Perhaps in his own country Thomas enjoys a repute still\r\nhigher than that of Gounod, for his genius is more peculiarly French,\r\nwhile the composer of \"Faust\" shows the radical influence of the German\r\nschool, not only in the cast of his thoughts and temperament, but in his\r\ntechnical musical methods. Still, as all artists are profoundly moved\r\nby the tendencies of their age, it would not be difficult to find in the\r\nlater works of Thomas, on which his celebrity is based, some unconscious\r\nmodeling of form wrought by that musical school of which Richard Wagner\r\nis the most advanced type.\r\n\r\nAmbroise Thomas was born at Metz, France, on August 5, 1811, and is\r\ntherefore by seven years the senior of Charles Gounod. His aptitudes for\r\nmusic were so strong that he learned the notes as quickly as he acquired\r\nthe letters of the alphabet. At the age of four he was instructed in his\r\n_solfeggi_ by his father, who was a professor of music, and three years\r\nlater he began to take lessons on the violin and piano. When he was\r\nseventeen he was thoroughly proficient in all the preparatory studies\r\ndemanded for admission to the Paris Conservatoire, and he easily\r\nobtained admission into that great institution. He first studied under\r\nZimmermann and Kalkbrenner, and afterward under Dourlen, Barbereau, Le\r\nSueur, and Reicha. For successive years he carried off first prizes: for\r\nthe piano in 1829; for harmony, in 1830; and in 1832 the highest honor\r\nin composition was awarded him, the Prix de Rome, which allowed him to\r\ngo to Italy as a government stipendiary.\r\n\r\nOur young laureate passed three years in Italy, spending most of his\r\ntime at Rome and Naples. The special result of his Italian studies was\r\na requiem mass, which was performed with great approbation from its\r\nmusical judges at Paris and Rome. After traveling in Germany, Thomas\r\nreturned to Paris in 1836, thoroughly equipped for his career as\r\ncomposer, for he had been an indefatigable student, and neglected no\r\nopportunity of perfecting his knowledge. The first step in the brilliant\r\ncareer of Thomas was the production of a comic opera in one act, \"La\r\nDouble Échelle,\" produced in 1837. This met with a good reception,\r\nand it was promptly followed by the production of several other light\r\nscores, that further enhanced his reputation for talent. He was not\r\ngenerally recognized by musicians as a man of marked promise till he\r\nproduced \"Mina,\" a comic opera in three acts, which was represented in\r\n1843. The beauty of the instrumentation and the melodious richness of\r\nthe work were unmistakable, and henceforth every production of the young\r\ncomposer was watched with great interest.\r\n\r\nAmbroise Thomas could not be said to have reached a great popular\r\nsuccess until he produced \"Le Caïd,\" a work of the _opéra-boitffe_\r\ntype, which instantly became an immense public favorite. This was first\r\nrepresented in 1849, and it has always held its place on the French\r\nstage as one of the most delightful works of its class, in spite of\r\nthe competition of such later outgrowths of the opera-bouffe, school\r\nas Offenbach, Lecocq, and others. The score of this work proved to be\r\nimmensely amusing and brightly melodious, and it was such a pecuniary\r\nsuccess that the more judicious friends of Thomas feared that he might\r\nbe seduced into cultivating a field far below the powers of his poetic\r\nimagination and thorough musical science. Strong heads might easily be\r\nturned by such lavish applause, and it would not have been wonderful had\r\nThomas, dazzled by the reception of \"Le Caïd,\" remained for a long\r\ntime a wanderer from the path which lay open to his great talents. The\r\ncomposer's ambition, however, proved to be too high to content itself\r\nwith ephemeral success, or cultivating the more frivolous forms of his\r\nart, however profitable aid pleasant these might be.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Ambroise Thomas produced two operas: \"Le Songe d'une Nuit\r\nd'Été,\" resembling in style somewhat that masterpiece produced in\r\nafter-years, \"Mignon,\" and a somber work based on the legend of \"The Man\r\nwith the Iron Mask,\" \"Le Secret de la Reine.\" The melodramatic character\r\nof this latter work seems to have been imitated from the highly accented\r\nand artificial style of Verdi, instead of possessing the bright and airy\r\ncharm natural to Thomas. The vacancy left by Spontini's death in the\r\nFrench Institute was filled by the election of M. Thomas, who was deemed\r\nmost worthy, among all the musical names offered, of taking the place of\r\nthe author of \"La Vestale.\" He justified the taste of his co-members by\r\nhis production in 1853 of the comic opera of \"La Tonelli,\" a work\r\nwhich, though not greatly successful with \"hoi polloi,\" was an admirable\r\nspecimen of light and graceful opera at its best. The new academician\r\nwas recompensed for the public indifference by the cordial appreciation\r\nwhich connoisseurs gave this tasteful and scientific production.\r\nAnother comic opera, \"Psyche,\" which soon appeared, though full of witty\r\nburlesque and humor in the libretto, and marked by delicious melody in\r\nevery part, failed to please, perhaps on account of the predominance\r\nof feminine rôles, and the absence of a good tenor part. Still a third\r\ncomic opera, the \"Carnaval de Venise\" saw the light the same season,\r\nwhich was written in large measure to show the marvelous flexibility of\r\nMme. Cabal's voice. Very few singers have been able to sing the rôle of\r\n_Sylvia_, who warbles a violin concerto from beginning to end, under the\r\ntitle of an \"Ariette without Words.\"\r\n\r\nAmbroise Thomas remained silent now for half a dozen years, aside from\r\nthe composition of a few charming songs. It is natural to suppose that\r\nhe was brooding over the conception of his greatest work, which was next\r\nto see the light of day, and add one more to the great operas of the\r\nworld. Such compositions are not hastily manufactured, but grow\r\nfor years out of the travail of heart and brain, deep thought, high\r\nimaginings, passionate sensibilities, elaborately wrought by time and\r\npatience, till at last they are crystallized into form.\r\n\r\n\"Mignon,\" a comic opera in three acts, was first represented at the\r\nThéâtre Lyrique, on November 17, 1866, before one of the most brilliant\r\nand enthusiastic audiences ever gathered in Paris. Its success was\r\nmagnificent. This was seven years after Gounod had made such a great\r\nstride among the composers of the age, by the production of \"Faust\";\r\nand it is within bounds to say that, since \"Faust,\" no opera had been\r\nproduced in Paris so vital with the breath of genius and great purpose,\r\nso full of sentiment and poetry, so symmetrical and balanced in its\r\ndifferentiation of music measured by its dramatic value, so instantly\r\nand splendidly recognized by the public, cultured and ignorant, gentle\r\nand simple.\r\n\r\nLike \"Faust,\" too, the opera of Thomas was based on a creation of\r\nGoethe. Without the pathetic episode of \"Mignon,\" the novel of \"Wilhelm\r\nMeister\" would lose much of its dramatic strength and quality. Of\r\ncourse, every libretto must part with some of the charm of the story\r\non which it is built; but in this instance the author succeeds in\r\npreserving nearly all the intrinsic worth of the Mignon episode. The\r\nmusic is admirably suited to a noble theme. There is hardly a weak\r\nbar in it from beginning to end; and some of the work here done by the\r\ncomposer will compare favorably with any operatic music ever hoard. In\r\nthis opera melodic phrase goes hand in hand with character and motive,\r\nand _Mignon, Philina, Wilhelm Meister, and Lothario_, are distinguished\r\nin the music with the finest dramatic discrimination.\r\n\r\nAmong the operas of recent years, \"Mignon\" ranks among the first for\r\nits taste, grace, and poetry. The first act is vigorous, bright, and\r\npicturesque; the second, touched with the finest points of passion and\r\nhumor; the third is inspired with a pathos and poetic ardor which lift\r\nthe composer to do his most magnificent work. But to describe \"Mignon\"\r\nto the public of today, which has heard it almost an innumerable number\r\nof times, is, as much as in the case of Gounod's \"Faust,\" \"carrying\r\ncoals to Newcastle.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Thomas produced \"Hamlet,\" and it was represented at the Grand\r\nOpera, with Mile. Christine Nilsson in the rôle of _Ophelia_, the\r\nsame singer having, if we mistake not, created the rôle of _Mignon_.\r\n\"Hamlet,\" though a marked artistic success, has failed to make the\r\nsame popular impression as \"Mignon,\" possibly because the theme is less\r\nsuited to operatic treatment; for the music _per se_ is of a fine type,\r\nand full of the genuine accents of passion.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the works named above, Ambroise Thomas has written \"La\r\nGypsy,\" \"Le Panier Fleuri,\" \"Carline,\" \"Le Roman d'Elvire,\" several\r\nfine masses, many beautiful songs, a requiem, and miscellaneous\r\nchurch-pieces. Thomas is famous in France for the generous encouragement\r\nand help which he extends to all young musicians, assistance which his\r\nposition in the Paris Conservatoire helps to make most valuable. He\r\nis now seventy-one years old, and, should he add nothing more to the\r\nmusical treasures of the present generation, much of what he has already\r\ndone will give him a permanent place in the temple of lyric music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBERLIOZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn the long list of brilliant names which have illustrated the fine\r\narts, there is none attached to a personality more interesting and\r\nimpressive than that of Hector Berlioz. He stands solitary, a colossus\r\nin music, with but few admirers and fewer followers. Original, puissant\r\nin faculties, fiercely dogmatic and intolerant, bizarre, his influence\r\nhas impressed itself profoundly on the musical world both for good\r\nand evil, but has failed to make disciples or to rear a school.\r\nNotwithstanding the defects and extravagances of Berlioz, it is safe to\r\nassert that no art or philosophy can boast of an example of more perfect\r\ndevotion to an ideal. The startling originality of Berlioz as a musician\r\nrests on a mental and emotional organization different from and in some\r\nrespects superior to that of any other eminent master. He possessed an\r\nardent temperament; a gorgeous imagination, that knew no rest in its\r\nworking, and at times became heated to the verge of madness; a most\r\nsubtile sense of hearing; an intellect of the keenest analytic turn; a\r\nmost arrogant will, full of enterprise and daring, which clung to its\r\npurpose with unrelenting tenacity; and passions of such heat and fervor\r\nthat they rarely failed when aroused to carry him beyond all bounds\r\nof reason. His genius was unique, his character cast in the mold of a\r\nTitan, his life a tragedy. Says Blaze de Bussy: \"Art has its martyrs,\r\nits forerunners crying in the wilderness, and feeding on roots. It has\r\nalso its spoiled children sated with bonbons and dainties.\" Berlioz\r\nbelongs to the former of these classes, and, if ever a prophet lifted up\r\nhis voice with a vehement and incessant outcry, it was he.\r\n\r\nHector Berlioz was born on December 11, 1803, at Côte Saint André,\r\na small town between Grenoble and Lyons. His father was an excellent\r\nphysician of more than ordinary attainments, and he superintended his\r\nson's studies with great zeal in the hope that the lad would also become\r\nan ornament of the healing profession. But young Hector, though an\r\nexcellent scholar in other branches, developed a special aptitude\r\nfor music, and at twelve he could sing at sight, and play difficult\r\nconcertos on the flute. The elder regarded music only as a graceful\r\nornament to life, and in no wise encouraged his son in thinking of music\r\nas a profession. So it was not long before Hector found his attention\r\ndirected to anatomy, physiology, osteology, etc. In his father's library\r\nhe had already read of Gluck, Haydn, Mozart, etc., and had found a\r\nmanuscript score of an opera which he had committed to memory. His\r\nsoul revolted more and more from the path cut out for him. \"Become a\r\nphysician!\" he cried, \"study anatomy; dissect; take part in horrible\r\noperations? No! no! That would be a total subversion of the natural\r\ncourse of my life.\"\r\n\r\nBut parental resolution carried the day, and, after he had finished the\r\npreliminary course of study, he was ordered up to Paris to join the army\r\nof medical students. So at the age of nineteen we find him lodged in\r\nthe Quartier Latin. His first introduction to medical studies had been\r\nunfortunate. On entering a dissecting-room he had been so convulsed with\r\nhorror as to leap from the window, and rush to his lodgings in an agony\r\nof dread and disgust, whence he did not emerge for twenty-four hours.\r\nAt last, however, by dint of habit he became somewhat used to the\r\ndisagreeable facts of his new life, and, to use his own words, \"bade\r\nfair to add one more to the army of bad physicians,\" when he went to\r\nthe opera one night and heard \"Les Danaïdes,\" Salieri's opera, performed\r\nwith all the splendid completeness of the Académie Royale. This awakened\r\ninto fresh life an unquenchable thirst for music, and he neglected his\r\nmedical studies for the library of the Conservatoire, where he learned\r\nby heart the scores of Gluck and Rameau. At last, on coming out one\r\nnight from a performance of \"Iphigénie,\" he swore that henceforth music\r\nshould have her divine rights of him, in spite of all and everything.\r\nHenceforth hospital, dissecting-room, and professor's lectures knew him\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nBut to get admission to the Conservatoire was now the problem; Berlioz\r\nset to work on a cantata with orchestral accompaniments, and in the mean\r\ntime sent the most imploring letters home asking his father's sanction\r\nfor this change of life. The inexorable parent replied by cutting off\r\nhis son's allowance, saying that he would not help him to become one\r\nof the miserable herd of unsuccessful musicians. The young enthusiast's\r\ncantata gained him admission to the classes of Le Sueur and Reicha at\r\nthe Conservatoire, but alas! dire poverty stared him in the face. The\r\nhistory of his shifts and privations for some months is a sad one. He\r\nslept in an old, unfurnished garret, and shivered under insufficient\r\nbedclothing, ate his bread and grapes on the Pont Neuf, and sometimes\r\ndebated whether a plunge into the Seine would not be the easiest way\r\nout of it all. No mongrel cur in the capital but had a sweeter bone to\r\ncrunch than he. But the young fellow for all this stuck to his work with\r\ndogged tenacity, managed to get a mass performed at St. Roch church, and\r\nsoon finished the score of an opera, \"Les Francs Juges.\" Flesh and\r\nblood would have given way at last under this hard diet, if he had\r\nnot obtained a position in the chorus of the Théâtre des Noveauteaus.\r\nBerlioz gives an amusing account of his going to compete with the horde\r\nof applicants--butchers, bakers, shop-apprentices, etc.--each one with\r\nhis roll of music under his arm.\r\n\r\nThe manager scanned the raw-boned starveling with a look of wonder.\r\n\"Where's your music?\" quoth the tyrant of a third-class theatre. \"I\r\ndon't want any, I can sing anything you can give me at sight,\" was the\r\nanswer. \"The devil!\" rejoined the manager; \"but we haven't any music\r\nhere.\" \"Well, what do you want?\" said Berlioz. \"I sing every note of all\r\nthe operas of Gluck, Piccini, Salieri, Rameau, Spontini, Grétry, Mozart,\r\nand Cimarosa, from memory.\" At hearing this amazing declaration, the\r\nrest of the competitors slunk away abashed, and Berlioz, after singing\r\nan aria from Spontini, was accorded the place, which guaranteed him\r\nfifty francs per month--a pittance, indeed, and yet a substantial\r\naddition to his resources. This pot-boiling connection of Berlioz was\r\nnever known to the public till after he became a distinguished man,\r\nthough he was accustomed to speak in vague terms of his early dramatic\r\ncareer as if it were a matter of romantic importance.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, he was relieved of the necessity of singing on the\r\nstage to amuse the Paris _bourgeoisie_, and in a singular fashion. He\r\nhad been put to great straits to get his first work, which had won him\r\nhis way into the Conservatoire, performed. An application to the great\r\nChateaubriand, who was noted for benevolence, had failed, for the author\r\nof \"La Génie de Christianisme\" was then almost as poor as Berlioz. At\r\nlast a young friend, De Pons, advanced him twelve hundred francs. Part\r\nof this Berlioz had repaid, but the creditor, put to it for money, wrote\r\nto Berlioz père, demanding a full settlement of the debt. The father was\r\nthus brought again into communication with his son, whom he found nearly\r\nsick unto death with a fever. His heart relented, and the old allowance\r\nwas resumed again, enabling the young musician to give his whole time to\r\nhis beloved art, instantly he convalesced from his illness.\r\n\r\nThe eccentric ways and heretical notions of Berlioz made him no favorite\r\nwith the dons of the Conservatoire, and by the irritable and autocratic\r\nCherubini he was positively hated. The young man took no pains to\r\nplacate this resentment, but on the other hand elaborated methods of\r\nmaking himself doubly offensive. His power of stinging repartee stood\r\nhim in good stead, and he never put a button on his foil. Had it been in\r\nold Cherubini's power to expel this bold pupil from the Conservatoire,\r\nno scruple would have held him back. But the genius and industry of\r\nBerlioz were undeniable, and there was no excuse for such extreme\r\nmeasures. Prejudiced as were his judges, he successively took several\r\nimportant prizes.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBerlioz's happiest evenings were at the Grand Opéra, for which he\r\nprepared himself by solemn meditation. At the head of a band of students\r\nand amateurs, he took on himself the right of the most outspoken\r\ncriticism, and led the enthusiasm or the condemnation of the audience.\r\nAt this time Beethoven was barely tolerated in Paris, and the great\r\nsymphonist was ruthlessly clipped and shorn to suit the French taste,\r\nwhich pronounced him \"bizarre, incoherent, diffuse, bustling with\r\nrough modulations and wild harmonies, destitute of melody, forced in\r\nexpression, noisy, and fearfully difficult,\" even as England at the same\r\ntime frowned down his immortal works as \"obstreperous roarings of\r\nmodern frenzy.\" Berlioz's clear, stern voice would often be heard,\r\nwhen liberties were taken with the score, loud above the din of the\r\ninstruments. \"What wretch has dared to tamper with the great Beethoven?\"\r\n\"Who has taken upon him to revise Gluck?\" This self-appointed arbiter\r\nbecame the dread of the operatic management, for, as a pupil of the\r\nConservatoire, he had some rights which could not be infringed.\r\n\r\nBerlioz composed some remarkable works while at the Conservatoire,\r\namong which were the \"Ouverture des Francs Juges,\" and the symphonie\r\n\"Fantastique,\" and in many ways indicated that the bent of his genius\r\nhad fully declared itself. His decided and indomitable nature disdained\r\nto wear a mask, and he never sugar-coated his opinion, however\r\nunpalatable to others. He was already in a state of fierce revolt\r\nagainst the conventional forms of the music of his day, and no\r\ntrumpet-tones of protest were too loud for him. He had now begun to\r\nwrite for the journals, though oftentimes his articles were refused on\r\naccount of their fierce assaults. \"Your hands are too full of stones,\r\nand there are too many glass windows about,\" was the excuse of one\r\neditor, softening the return of a manuscript. But Berlioz did not fully\r\nknow himself or appreciate the tendencies fermenting within him until\r\nin 1830 he became the victim of a grand Shakespearean passion. The great\r\nEnglish dramatist wrought most powerfully on Victor Hugo and Hector\r\nBerlioz, and had much to do with their artistic development. Berlioz\r\ngives a very interesting account of his Shakespearean enthusiasm, which\r\nalso involved one of the catastrophes of his own personal life. \"An\r\nEnglish company gave some plays of Shakespeare, at that time wholly\r\nunknown to the French public. I went to the first performance of\r\n'Hamlet' at the Odéon. I saw, in the part of _Ophelia_, Harriet\r\nSmithson, who became my wife five years afterward. The effect of her\r\nprodigious talent, or rather of her dramatic genius, upon my heart and\r\nimagination, is only comparable to the complete overturning which the\r\npoet, whose worthy interpreter she was, caused in me. Shakespeare, thus\r\ncoming on me suddenly, struck me as with a thunderbolt. His lightning\r\nopened the heaven of art to me with a sublime crash, and lighted up its\r\nfarthest depths. I recognized true dramatic grandeur, beauty, and truth.\r\nI measured at the same time the boundless inanity of the notions of\r\nShakespeare in France, spread abroad by Voltaire,\r\n\r\n     '... ce singe de génie,\r\n     Chez l'homme en mission par le diable envoyé--'\r\n\r\n(that ape of genius, an emissary from the devil to man),' and the\r\npitiful poverty of our old poetry of pedagogues and ragged-school\r\nteachers. I saw, I understood, I felt that I was alive and must arise\r\nand walk.\" Of the influence of \"Romeo and Juliet\" on him, he says:\r\n\"Exposing myself to the burning sun and balmy nights of Italy, seeing\r\nthis love as quick and sudden as thought, burning like lava, imperious,\r\nirresistible, boundless, and pure and beautiful as the smile of angels,\r\nthose furious scenes of vengeance, those distracted embraces, those\r\nstruggles between love and death, was too much. After the melancholy,\r\nthe gnawing anguish, the tearful love, the cruel irony, the somber\r\nmeditations, the heart-rackings, the madness, tears, mourning, the\r\ncalamities and sharp cleverness of _Hamlet_; after the gray clouds and\r\nicy winds of Denmark; after the third act, hardly breathing, in pain as\r\nif a hand of iron were squeezing at my heart, I said to myself with the\r\nfullest conviction: 'Ah! I am lost.' I must add that I did not at that\r\ntime know a word of English, that I only caught glimpses of Shakespeare\r\nthrough the fog of Letourneur's translation, and that I consequently\r\ncould not perceive the poetic web that surrounds his marvelous creations\r\nlike a net of gold. I have the misfortune to be very nearly in the same\r\nsad case to-day. It is much harder for a Frenchman to sound the\r\ndepths of Shakespeare than for an Englishman to feel the delicacy\r\nand originality of La Fontaine or Molière. Our two poets are rich\r\ncontinents; Shakespeare is a world. But the play of the actors, above\r\nall of the actress, the succession of the scenes, the pantomime and the\r\naccent of the voices, meant more to me, and filled me a thousand times\r\nmore with Shakespearean ideas and passion than the text of my colorless\r\nand unfaithful translation. An English critic said last winter in the\r\n'Illustrated London News,' that, after seeing Miss Smithson in _Juliet_,\r\nI had cried out, 'I will marry that woman and write my grandest symphony\r\non this play.' I did both, but never said anything of the sort.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Miss Smithson became the rage, the inspiration of poets\r\nand painters, the idol of the hour, at whose feet knelt all the _roués_\r\nand rich idlers of the town. Delacroix painted her as the _Ophelia_\r\nof his celebrated picture, and the English company made nearly as much\r\nsensation in Paris as the Comédie Française recently aroused in London.\r\nBerlioz's mind, perturbed and inflamed with the mighty images of\r\nthe Shakespearean world, swept with wide, powerful passion toward\r\nShakespeare's interpreter. He raged and stormed with his accustomed\r\nvehemence, made no secret of his infatuation, and walked the streets at\r\nnight, calling aloud the name of the enchantress, and cooling his heated\r\nbrows with many a sigh. He, too, would prove that he was a great artist,\r\nand his idol should know that she had no unworthy lover. He would give\r\na concert, and Miss Smithson should be present by hook or by crook.\r\nHe went to Cherubini and asked permission to use the great hall of the\r\nConservatoire, but was churlishly refused. Berlioz however, managed to\r\nsecure the concession over the head of Cherubini, and advertised his\r\nconcert. He went to large expense in copyists, orchestra, solo-singers,\r\nand chorus, and, when the night came, was almost fevered with\r\nexpectation. But the concert was a failure, and the adored one was not\r\nthere; she had not even heard of it! The disappointment nearly laid\r\nthe young composer on a bed of sickness; but, if he oscillated between\r\ndeliriums of hope and despair, his powerful will was also full of\r\nelasticity, and not for long did he even rave in the utter ebb of\r\ndisappointment. Throughout the whole of his life, Berlioz displayed this\r\nswiftness of recoil; one moment crazed with grief and depression,\r\nthe next he would bend to his labor with a cool, steady fixedness of\r\npurpose, which would sweep all interferences aside like cobwebs. But\r\nstill, night after night, he would haunt the Odéon, and drink in the\r\nsights and sounds of the magic world of Shakespeare, getting fresh\r\ninspiration nightly for his genius and love. If he paid dearly for this\r\nrich intellectual acquaintance by his passion for La Belle Smithson, he\r\nyet gained impulses and suggestions for his imagination, ravenous of new\r\nimpressions, which wrought deeply and permanently. Had Berlioz known the\r\noutcome, he would not have bartered for immunity by losing the jewels\r\nand ingots of the Shakespeare treasure-house.\r\n\r\nThe year 1830 was for Berlioz one of alternate exaltation and misery;\r\nof struggle, privation, disappointment; of all manner of torments\r\ninseparable from such a volcanic temperament and restless brain. But he\r\nhad one consolation which gratified his vanity. He gained the Prix de\r\nRome by his cantata of \"Sardanapalus.\" This honor had a practical value\r\nalso. It secured him an annuity of three thousand francs for a period of\r\nfive years, and two years' residence in Italy. Berlioz would never let\r\n\"well enough\" alone, however. He insisted on adding an orchestral part\r\nto the completed score, describing the grand conflagration of the palace\r\nof Sardanapalus. When the work was produced, it was received with a\r\nhowl of sarcastic derision, owing to the latest whim of the composer. So\r\nBerlioz started for Italy, smarting with rage and pain, as if the Furies\r\nwere lashing him with their scorpion whips.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe pensioners of the Conservatoire lived at Rome in the Villa Medici,\r\nand the illustrious painter, Horace Vernet, was the director, though he\r\nexercised but little supervision over the studies of the young men under\r\nhis nominal charge. Berlioz did very much as he pleased--studied little\r\nor much as the whim seized him, visited the churches, studios, and\r\npicture-galleries, and spent no little of his time by starlight and\r\nsunlight roaming about the country adjacent to the Holy City in search\r\nof adventures. He had soon come to the conclusion that he had not much\r\nto learn of Italian music; that he could teach rather than be taught. He\r\nspeaks of Roman art with the bitterest scorn, and Wagner himself never\r\nmade a more savage indictment of Italian music than does Berlioz in his\r\n\"Mémoires.\" At the theatres he found the orchestra, dramatic unity, and\r\ncommon-sense all sacrificed to mere vocal display. At St. Peter's and\r\nthe Sistine Chapel religious earnestness and dignity were frittered away\r\nin pretty part-singing, in mere frivolity and meretricious show. The\r\nword \"symphony\" was not known except to indicate an indescribable\r\nnoise before the rising of the curtain. Nobody had heard of Weber and\r\nBeethoven, and Mozart, dead more than a score of years, was mentioned by\r\na well-known musical connoisseur as a young man of great promise! Such\r\nsurroundings as these were a species of purgatory to Berlioz, against\r\nwhose bounds he fretted and raged without intermission. The director's\r\nreceptions were signalized by the performance of insipid cavatinas, and\r\nfrom these, as from his companions' revels in which he would sometimes\r\nindulge with the maddest debauchery as if to kill his own thoughts, he\r\nwould escape to wander in the majestic ruins of the Coliseum and see the\r\nmagic Italian moonlight shimmer through its broken arches, or stroll on\r\nthe lonely Campagna till his clothes were drenched with dew. No fear of\r\nthe deadly Roman malaria could check his restless excursions, for, like\r\na fiery horse, he was irritated to madness by the inaction of his life.\r\nTo him the _dolce far niente_ was a meaningless phrase. His comrades\r\nscoffed at him and called him \"_Père la Joie_,\" in derision of the\r\nfierce melancholy which despised them, their pursuits and pleasures.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year he was obliged to present, something before\r\nthe Institute as a mark of his musical advancement, and he sent on a\r\nfragment of his \"Mass\" heard years before at St. Roch, in which the wise\r\njudges professed to find the \"evidences of material advancement, and the\r\ntotal abandonment of his former reprehensible tendencies.\" One can\r\nfancy the scornful laughter of Berlioz at hearing this verdict. But his\r\nItalian life was not altogether purposeless. He revised his \"Symphonie\r\nFantastique,\" and wrote its sequel, \"Lelio,\" a lyrical monologue, in\r\nwhich he aimed to express the memories of his passion for the beautiful\r\nMiss Smithson. These two parts comprised what Berlioz named \"An Episode\r\nin the Life of an Artist.\" Our composer managed to get the last six\r\nmonths of his Italian exile remitted, and his return to Paris was\r\nhastened by one of those furious paroxysms of rage to which such\r\nill-regulated minds are subject. He had adored Miss Smithson as a\r\ncelestial divinity, a lovely ideal of art and beauty, but this had not\r\nprevented him from basking in the rays of the earthly Venus. Before\r\nleaving Paris he had had an intrigue with a certain Mile. M------,\r\na somewhat frivolous and unscrupulous beauty, who had bled his not\r\noverfilled purse with the avidity of a leech. Berlioz heard just before\r\nreturning to Paris that the coquette was about to marry, a conclusion\r\none would fancy which would have rejoiced his mind. But, no! he was\r\nworked to a dreadful rage by what he considered such perfidy! His one\r\nthought was to avenge himself. He provided himself with three loaded\r\npistols--one for the faithless one, one for his rival, and one for\r\nhimself--and was so impatient to start that he could not wait for\r\npassports. He attempted to cross the frontier in women's clothes, and\r\nwas arrested. A variety of _contretemps_ occurred before he got to\r\nParis, and by that time his rage had so cooled, his sense of the\r\nabsurdity of the whole thing grown so keen, that he was rather willing\r\nto send Mile. M------his blessing than his curse.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of Berlioz's arrival, Miss Smithson also returned\r\nto Paris after a long absence, with the intent of undertaking the\r\nmanagement of an English theatre. It was a necessity of our composer's\r\nnature to be in love, and the flames of his ardor, fed with fresh fuel,\r\nblazed up again from their old ashes. Berlioz gave a concert, in which\r\nhis \"Episode in the Life of an Artist\" was interpreted in connection\r\nwith the recitations of the text. The explanations of \"Lelio\" so\r\nunmistakably pointed to the feeling of the composer for herself, that\r\nMiss Smithson, who by chance was present, could not be deceived, though\r\nshe never yet had seen Berlioz. A few days afterward a benefit concert\r\nwas arranged, in which Miss Smithson's troupe was to take part, as well\r\nas Berlioz, who was to direct a symphony of his own composition. At\r\nthe rehearsal, the looks of Berlioz followed Miss Smithson with such\r\nan intent stare, that she said to some one, \"Who is that man whose eyes\r\nbode me no good?\" This was the first occasion of their personal meeting,\r\nand it may be fancied that Berlioz followed up the introduction with his\r\naccustomed vehemence and pertinacity, though without immediate effect,\r\nfor Miss Smithson was more inclined to fear than to love him.\r\n\r\nThe young directress soon found out that the rage for Shakespeare, which\r\nhad swept the public mind under the influence of the romanticism led by\r\nVictor Hugo, Dumas, Théophile Gautier, Balzac, and others, was spurious.\r\nThe wave had been frothing but shallow, and it ebbed away, leaving the\r\nEnglish actress and her enterprise gasping for life. With no deeper\r\ntap-root than the Gallic love of novelty and the infectious enthusiasm\r\nof a few men of great genius, the Shakespearean mania had a short\r\nlife, and Frenchmen shrugged their shoulders over their own folly, in\r\ntemporarily preferring the English barbarian to Racine, Corneille, and\r\nMolière. The letters of Berlioz, in which he scourges the fickleness\r\nof his countrymen in returning again to their \"false gods,\" are\r\nmasterpieces of pointed invective.\r\n\r\nMiss Smithson was speedily involved in great pecuniary difficulty, and,\r\nto add to her misfortunes, she fell down stairs and broke her leg,\r\nthus precluding her own appearance on the stage. Affairs were in this\r\ndesperate condition, when Berlioz came to the fore with a delicate and\r\nmanly chivalry worthy of the highest praise. He offered to pay Miss\r\nSmithson's debts, though a poor man himself, and to marry her without\r\ndelay. The ceremony took place immediately, and thus commenced a\r\nconnection which hampered and retarded Berlioz's career, as well as\r\ncaused him no little personal unhappiness. He speedily discovered that\r\nhis wife was a woman of fretful, imperious temper, jealous of mere\r\nshadows (though Berlioz was a man to give her substantial cause), and\r\ntotally lacking in sympathy writh his high-art ideals.\r\n\r\nWhen Mme. Berlioz recovered, it was to find herself unable longer to\r\nact, as her leg was stiff and her movements unsuited to the exigencies\r\nof the stage. Poor Berlioz was crushed by the weight of the obligations\r\nhe had assumed, and, as the years went on, the peevish plaints of an\r\ninvalid wife, who had lost her beauty and power of charming, withered\r\nthe affection which had once been so fervid and passionate. Berlioz\r\nfinally separated from his once beautiful and worshiped Harriet\r\nSmithson, but to the very last supplied her wants as fully as he\r\ncould out of the meager earnings of his literary work and of musical\r\ncompositions, which the Paris public, for the most part, did not care to\r\nlisten to. For his son, Louis, the only offspring of this union, Berlioz\r\nfelt a devoted affection, and his loss at sea in after-years was a blow\r\nthat nearly broke his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nOwing to the unrelenting hostility of Cherubini, Berlioz failed to\r\nsecure a professorship at the Conservatoire, a place to which he was\r\nnobly entitled, and was fain to take up with the position of librarian\r\ninstead. The paltry wage he eked out by journalistic writing, for the\r\nmost part as musical critic of the \"Journal des Débats,\" by occasional\r\nconcerts, revising proofs, in a word anything which a versatile and\r\ndesperate Bohemian could turn his hand to. In fact, for many years the\r\nmain subsistence of Berlioz was derived from feuilleton-writing and\r\nthe labors of a critic. His prose is so witty, brilliant, fresh, and\r\nepigrammatic that he would have been known to posterity as a clever\r\n_litterateur_, had he not preferred to remain merely a great musician.\r\nDramatic, picturesque, and subtile, with an admirable sense of art-form,\r\nhe could have become a powerful dramatist, perhaps a great novelist. But\r\nhis soul, all whose aspirations set toward one goal, revolted from the\r\nlabors of literature, still more from the daily grind of journalistic\r\ndrudgery. In that remarkable book, \"Mémoires de Hector Berlioz,\" he\r\nhas made known his misery, and thus recounts one of his experiences:\r\n\"I stood at the window gazing into the gardens, at the heights of\r\nMontmartre, at the setting sun; reverie bore me a thousand leagues from\r\nmy accursed comic opera. And when, on turning, my eyes fell upon the\r\naccursed title at the head of the accursed sheet, blank still, and\r\nobstinately awaiting my word, despair seized upon me. My guitar rested\r\nagainst the table; with a kick I crushed its side. Two pistols on the\r\nmantel stared at me with great round eyes. I regarded them for\r\nsome time, then beat my forehead with clinched hand. At last I wept\r\nfuriously, like a schoolboy unable to do his theme. The bitter tears\r\nwere a relief. I turned the pistols toward the wall; I pitied my\r\ninnocent guitar, and sought a few chords, which were given without\r\nresentment. Just then my son of six years knocked at the door [the\r\nlittle Louis whose death, years after, was the last bitter drop in the\r\ncomposer's cup of life]; owing to my ill-humor, I had unjustly scolded\r\nhim that morning. 'Papa,' he cried, 'wilt thou be friends?' 'I _will_ be\r\nfriends; come on, my boy'; and I ran to open the door. I took him on\r\nmy knee, and, with his blonde head on my breast, we slept together....\r\nFifteen years since then, and my torment still endures. Oh, to be always\r\nthere!--scores to write, orchestras to lead, rehearsals to direct. Let\r\nme stand all day with _bâton_ in hand, training a chorus, singing their\r\nparts myself, and beating the measure until I spit blood, and cramp\r\nseizes my arm; let me carry desks, double basses, harps, remove\r\nplatforms, nail planks like a porter or a carpenter, and then spend the\r\nnight in rectifying the errors of engravers or copyists. I have done,\r\ndo, and will do it. That belongs to my musical life, and I bear it\r\nwithout thinking of it, as the hunter bears the thousand fatigues of the\r\nchase. But to scribble eternally for a livelihood--!\"\r\n\r\nIt may be fancied that such a man as Berlioz did not spare the lash,\r\nonce he griped the whip-handle, and, though no man was more generous\r\nthan he in recognizing and encouraging genuine merit, there was none\r\nmore relentless in scourging incompetency, pretentious commonplace, and\r\nthe blind conservatism which rests all its faith in what has been.\r\nOur composer made more than one powerful enemy by this recklessness in\r\ntelling the truth, where a more politic man would have gained friends\r\nstrong to help in time of need. But Berlioz was too bitter and reckless,\r\nas well as too proud, to debate consequences.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Berlioz completed his \"Benvenuto Cellini,\" his only attempt at\r\nopera since \"Les Francs Juges,\" and, wonderful to say, managed to get it\r\ndone at the opera, though the director, Duponchel, laughed at him as a\r\nlunatic, and the whole company already regarded the work as damned in\r\nadvance. The result was a most disastrous and _éclatant_ failure, and\r\nit would have crushed any man whose moral backbone was not forged of\r\nthrice-tempered steel. With all these back-sets Hector Berlioz was not\r\nwithout encouragement. The brilliant Franz Liszt, one of the musical\r\nidols of the age, had bowed before him and called him master, the great\r\nmusical protagonist. Spontini, one of the most successful composers of\r\nthe time, held him in affectionate admiration, and always bade him be\r\nof good cheer. Paganini, the greatest of violinists, had hailed him as\r\nequal to Beethoven.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the failure of \"Benvenuto Cellini,\" a strange-looking\r\nman with disheveled black hair and eyes of piercing brilliancy had\r\nforced his way around into the green-room, and, seeking out Berlioz, had\r\nfallen on his knees before him and kissed his hand passionately. Then\r\nhe threw his arms around him and hailed the astonished composer as the\r\nmaster-spirit of the age in terms of glowing eulogium. The next morning,\r\nwhile Berlioz was in bed, there was a tap at the door, and Paganini's\r\nson, Achille, entered with a note, saying his father was sick, or he\r\nwould have come to pay his respects in person. On opening the note\r\nBerlioz found a most complimentary letter, and a more substantial\r\nevidence of admiration, a check on Baron Rothschild for twenty thousand\r\nfrancs! Paganini also gave Berlioz a commission to write a concerto for\r\nhis Stradivarius viola, which resulted in a grand symphony, \"Harold\r\nen Italie,\" founded on Byron's \"Childe Harold,\" but still more an\r\ninspiration of his own Italian adventures, which had had a strong flavor\r\nof personal if they lacked artistic interest.\r\n\r\nThe generous gift of Paganini raised Berlioz from the slough of\r\nnecessity so far that he could give his whole time to music. Instantly\r\nhe set about his \"Romeo and Juliet\" symphony, which will always remain\r\none of his masterpieces--a beautifully chiseled work, from the hands\r\nof one inspired by gratitude, unfettered imagination, and the sense of\r\nblessed repose. Our composer's first musical journey was an extensive\r\ntour in Germany in 1841, of which he gives charming memorials in\r\nhis letters to Liszt, Heine, Ernst, and others. His reception was as\r\ngenerous and sympathetic as it had been cold and scornful in France.\r\nEverywhere he was honored and praised as one of the great men of the\r\nage. Mendelssohn exchanged _bâtons_ with him at Leipsic, notwithstanding\r\nthe former only half understood this stalwart Berserker of music. Spohr\r\ncalled him one of the greatest artists living, though his own direct\r\nantithesis, and Schumann wrote glowingly in the \"Neue Zeitschrift\": \"For\r\nmyself, Berlioz is as clear as the blue sky above. I really think there\r\nis a new time in music coming.\" Berlioz wrote joyfully to Heine: \"I came\r\nto Germany as the men of ancient Greece went to the oracle at Delphi,\r\nand the response has been in the highest degree encouraging.\" But his\r\nGermanic laurels did him no good in France. The Parisians would have\r\nnone of him except as a writer of _feuilletons_, who pleased them by\r\nthe vigor with which he handled the knout, and tickled the levity of\r\nthe million, who laughed while they saw the half-dozen or more victims\r\nflayed by merciless satire. Berlioz wept tears of blood because he had\r\nto do such executioner's work, but did it none the less vigorously for\r\nall that.\r\n\r\nThe composer made another musical journey in Austria and Hungary in\r\n1844-'45, where he was again received with the most enthusiastic praise\r\nand pleasure. It was in Hungary, especially, that the warmth of his\r\naudiences overran all bounds. One night, at Pesth, where he played the\r\n\"Rackoczy Indulé,\" an orchestral setting of the martial hymn of the\r\nMagyar race, the people were worked into a positive frenzy, and they\r\nwould have flung themselves before him that he might walk over their\r\nprostrate bodies. Vienna, Pesth, and Prague, led the way, and the other\r\ncities followed in the wake of an enthusiasm which has been accorded\r\nto not many artists. The French heard these stories with amazement, for\r\nthey could not understand how this musical demigod could be the same\r\nas he who was little better than a witty buffoon. During this absence\r\nBerlioz wrote the greater portion of his \"Damnation de Faust,\" and, as\r\nhe had made some money, he obeyed the strong instinct which always ruled\r\nhim, the hope of winning the suffrages of his own countrymen.\r\n\r\nAn eminent French critic claims that this great work, of which we shall\r\nspeak further on, contains that which Gounod's \"Faust\" lacks--insight\r\ninto the spiritual significance of Goethe's drama. Berlioz exhausted all\r\nhis resources in producing it at the Opéra Comique in 1846, but again\r\nhe was disappointed by its falling stillborn on the public interest.\r\nBerlioz was utterly ruined, and he fled from France in the dead of\r\nwinter as from a pestilence.\r\n\r\nThe genius of this great man was recognized in Holland, Russia, Austria,\r\nand Germany, but among his own countrymen, for the most part, his name\r\nwas a laughing-stock and a by-word. He offended the pedants and the\r\nformalists by his daring originality, he had secured the hate of rival\r\nmusicians by the vigor and keenness of his criticisms. Berlioz was in\r\nthe very heat of the artistic controversy between the classicists and\r\nromanticists, and was associated with Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas,\r\nDelacroix, Liszt, Chopin, and others, in fighting that acrimonious\r\nart-battle. While he did not stand formally with the ranks, he yet\r\nsecured a still more bitter portion of hostility from their powerful\r\nopponents, for, to opposition in principle, Berlioz united a caustic\r\nand vigorous mode of expression. His name was a target for the wits. \"A\r\nphysician who plays on the guitar and fancies himself a composer,\" was\r\nthe scoff of malignant gossips. The journals poured on him a flood\r\nof abuse without stint. French malignity is the most venomous and\r\nunscrupulous in the world, and Berlioz was selected as a choice victim\r\nfor its most vigorous exercise, none the less willingly that he had\r\nshown so much skill and zest in impaling the victims of his own artistic\r\nand personal dislike.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTo continue the record of Berlioz's life in consecutive narrative would\r\nbe without significance, for it contains but little for many years\r\nexcept the same indomitable battle against circumstance and enmity,\r\nnever yielding an inch, and always keeping his eyes bent on his own\r\nlofty ideal. In all of art history is there no more masterful heroic\r\nstruggle than Berlioz waged for thirty-five years, firm in his belief\r\nthat some time, if not during his own life, his principles would be\r\ntriumphant, and his name ranked among the immortals. But what of the\r\nmean while? This problem Berlioz solved, in his later as in earlier\r\nyears, by doing the distasteful work of the literary scrub. But never\r\ndid he cease composing; though no one would then have his works, his\r\nclear eye perceived the coming time when his genius would not be denied,\r\nwhen an apotheosis should comfort his spirit wandering in Hades.\r\n\r\nAmong Berlioz's later works was an opera of which he had composed both\r\nwords and music, consisting of two parts, \"The Taking of Troy,\" and\r\n\"The Trojans at Carthage,\" the latter of which at last secured a few\r\nrepresentations at a minor theatre in 1863. The plan of this work\r\nrequired that it should be carried out under the most perfect\r\nconditions. \"In order,\" says Berlioz, \"to properly produce such a work\r\nas 'Les Trojans,' I must be absolute master of the theatre, as of the\r\norchestra in directing a symphony. I must have the good-will of all, be\r\nobeyed by all, from prima donna to scene-shifter. A lyrical theatre, as\r\nI conceive it, is a great instrument of music, which, if I am to play,\r\nmust be placed unreservedly in my hands.\" Wagner found a King of Bavaria\r\nto help him carry out a similar colossal scheme at Bayreuth, but ill\r\nluck followed a man no less great through life. His grand \"Trojans\"\r\nwas mutilated, tinkered, patched, and belittled, to suit the Theatre\r\nLyrique. It was a butchery of the work, but still it yielded the\r\ncomposer enough to justify his retirement from the \"Journal des Débats,\"\r\nafter thirty years of slavery.\r\n\r\nBerlioz was now sixty years old, a lonely man, frail in body, embittered\r\nin soul by the terrible sense of failure. His wife, with whom he had\r\nlived on terms of alienation, was dead; his only son far away, cruising\r\non a man-of-war. His courage and ambition were gone. To one who remarked\r\nthat his music belonged to the future, he replied that he doubted if it\r\never belonged to the past. His life seemed to have been a mistake, so\r\nutterly had he failed to impress himself on the public. Yet there were\r\ntimes when audiences felt themselves moved by the power of his music\r\nout of the ruts of preconceived opinion into a prophecy of his coming\r\ngreatness. There is an interesting anecdote told by a French writer:\r\n\r\n\"Some years ago M. Pasdeloup gave the _septuor_ from the 'Trojans' at\r\na benefit concert. The best places were occupied by the people of the\r\nworld, but the _elite intelligente_ were ranged upon the highest seats\r\nof the Cirque. The programme was superb, and those who were there\r\nneither for Fashion's nor Charity's sake, but for love of what was\r\nbest in art, were enthusiastic in view of all those masterpieces. The\r\nworthless overture of the 'Prophète,' disfiguring this fine _ensemble_,\r\nhad been hissed by some students of the Conservatoire, and, accustomed\r\nas I was to the blindness of the general public, knowing its implacable\r\nprejudices, I trembled for the fate of the magnificent _septuor_ about\r\nto follow. My fears were strangely ill-founded, no sooner had ceased\r\nthis hymn of infinite love and peace, than these same students, and the\r\nwhole assemblage with them, burst into such a tempest of applause as I\r\nnever heard before. Berlioz was hidden in the further ranks, and, the\r\ninstant he was discovered, the work was forgotten for the man; his\r\nname flew from mouth to mouth, and four thousand people were standing\r\nupright, with their arms stretched toward him. Chance had placed me near\r\nhim, and never shall I forget the scene. That name, apparently ignored\r\nby the crowd, it had learned all at once, and was repeating as that of\r\none of its heroes. Overcome as by the strongest emotion of his life,\r\nhis head upon his breast, he listened to this tumultuous cry of 'Vive\r\nBerlioz!' and when, on looking up, he saw all eyes upon him and all\r\narms extended toward him, he could not withstand the sight; he trembled,\r\ntried to smile, and broke into sobbing.\"\r\n\r\nBerlioz's supremacy in the field of orchestral composition, his\r\nknowledge of technique, his novel combination, his insight into the\r\nresources of instruments, his skill in grouping, his rich sense of\r\ncolor, are incontestably without a parallel, except by Beethoven and\r\nWagner. He describes his own method of study as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I carried with me to the opera the score of whatever work was on\r\nthe bill, and read during the performance. In this way I began to\r\nfamiliarize myself with orchestral methods, and to learn the voice and\r\nquality of the various instruments, if not their range and mechanism.\r\nBy this attentive comparison of the effect with the means employed to\r\nproduce it, I found the hidden link uniting musical expression to the\r\nspecial art of instrumentation. The study of Beethoven, Weber,\r\nand Spontini, the impartial examination both of the _customs_ of\r\norchestration and of _unusual_ forms and combinations, the visits I\r\nmade to _virtuosi_, the trials I led them to make upon their respective\r\ninstruments, and a little instinct, did for me the rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal symphonies of Berlioz are works of colossal character\r\nand richness of treatment, some of them requiring several orchestras.\r\nContrasting with these are such marvels of delicacy as \"Queen Mab,\" of\r\nwhich it has been said that the \"confessions of roses and the complaints\r\nof violets were noisy in comparison.\" A man of magnificent genius and\r\nknowledge, he was but little understood during his life, and it was\r\nonly when his uneasy spirit was at rest that the world recognized his\r\ngreatness. Paris, that stoned him when he was living, now listens to his\r\ngrand music with enthusiasm. Hector Berlioz to the last never lost\r\nfaith in himself, though this man of genius, in his much suffering from\r\ndepression and melancholy, gave good witness to the truth of Goethe's\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n     \"Who never ate with tears his bread,\r\n     Nor, weeping through the night's long hours,\r\n     Lay restlessly tossing on his bed--\r\n     He knows ye not, ye heavenly Powers!\"\r\n\r\nA man utterly without reticence, who, Gallic fashion, would shout his\r\nwrongs and sufferings to the uttermost ends of the earth, yet without\r\na smack of Gallic posing and affectation, Berlioz talks much about\r\nhimself, and dares to estimate himself boldly. There was no small\r\nvanity about this colossal spirit. He speaks of himself with outspoken\r\nfrankness, as he would discuss another. We can not do better than to\r\nquote one of these self-measurements: \"My style is in general very\r\ndaring, but it has not the slightest tendency to destroy any of the\r\nconstructive elements of art. On the contrary, I seek to increase the\r\nnumber of these elements. I have never dreamed, as has foolishly been\r\nsupposed in France, of writing music without melody. That school exists\r\nto-day in Germany, and I have a horror of it. It is easy for any one to\r\nconvince himself that, without confining myself to taking a very short\r\nmelody for a theme, as the very greatest masters have, I have always\r\ntaken care to invest my compositions with a real wealth of melody. The\r\nvalue of these melodies, their distinction, their novelty, and charm,\r\ncan be very well contested; it is not for me to appraise them. But to\r\ndeny their existence is either bad faith or stupidity; only as these\r\nmelodies are often of very large dimensions, infantile and short-sighted\r\nminds do not clearly distinguish their form; or else they are wedded\r\nto other secondary melodies which veil their outlines from those same\r\ninfantile minds; or, upon the whole, these melodies are so dissimilar\r\nto the little waggeries that the musical _plebs_ call melodies that they\r\ncan not make up their minds to give the same name to both. The dominant\r\nqualities of my music are passionate expression, internal fire, rhythmic\r\nanimation, and unexpected changes.\"\r\n\r\nHeinrich Heine, the German poet, who was Berlioz's friend, called him\r\na \"colossal nightingale, a lark of eagle-size, such as they tell us\r\nexisted in the primeval world.\" The poet goes on to say: \"Berlioz's\r\nmusic, in general, has in it something primeval if not antediluvian to\r\nmy mind; it makes me think of gigantic species of extinct animals, of\r\nfabulous empires full of fabulous sins, of heaped-up impossibilities;\r\nhis magical accents call to our minds Babylon, the hanging gardens the\r\nwonders of Nineveh, the daring edifices of Mizraim, as we see them in\r\nthe pictures of the Englishman Martin.\" Shortly after the publication of\r\n\"Lutetia,\" in which this bold characterization was expressed, the first\r\nperformance of Berlioz's \"Enfance du Christ\" was given, and the poet,\r\nwho was on his sick-bed, wrote a penitential letter to his friend for\r\nnot having given him full justice. \"I hear on all sides,\" he says, \"that\r\nyou have just plucked a nosegay of the sweetest melodious flowers, and\r\nthat your oratorio is throughout a masterpiece of _naivete_. I shall\r\nnever forgive myself for having been so unjust to a friend.\"\r\n\r\nBerlioz died at the age of sixty-five. His funeral services were held\r\nat the Church of the Trinity, a few days after those of Rossini. The\r\ndiscourse at the grave was pronounced by Gounod, and many eloquent\r\nthings were said of him, among them a quotation of the epitaph of\r\nMarshal Trivulce, \"_Hic tandem quiescit qui nunquam quievit_\" (Here is\r\nhe quiet, at last, who never was quiet before). Soon after his death\r\nappeared his \"Mémoires,\" and his bones had hardly got cold when the\r\nperformance of his music at the Conservatoire, the Cirque, and the\r\nChatelet began to be heard with the most hearty enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThéophile Gautier says that no one will deny to Berlioz a great\r\ncharacter, though, the world being given to controversies, it may be\r\nargued whether or not he was a great genius. The world of to-day has but\r\none opinion on both these questions. The force of Berlioz's character\r\nwas phenomenal. His vitality was so passionate and active that brain\r\nand nerve quivered with it, and made him reach out toward experience at\r\nevery facet of his nature. Quietude was torture, rest a sin, for this\r\ndaring temperament. His eager and subtile intelligence pierced every\r\nsham, and his imagination knew no bounds to its sweep, oftentimes even\r\ndisdaining the bounds of art in its audacity and impatience. This big,\r\nvirile nature, thwarted and embittered by opposition, became hardened\r\ninto violent self-assertion; this naturally resolute will settled back\r\ninto fierce obstinacy; this fine nature, sensitive and sincere, got torn\r\nand ragged with passion under the stress of his unfortunate life. But,\r\nat one breath of true sympathy how quickly the nobility of the man\r\nasserted itself! All his cynicism and hatred melted away, and left only\r\nsweetness, truth, and genial kindness.\r\n\r\nWhen Berlioz entered on his studies, he had reached an age at which\r\nMozart, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Rossini, and others, had already done\r\nsome of the best work of their lives. Yet it took only a few years to\r\nachieve a development that produced such a great work as the \"Symphonic\r\nFantastique,\" the prototype of modern programme music.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last it was the ambition of Berlioz to widen the domain\r\nof his art. He strove to attain a more intimate connection between\r\ninstrumental music and poetry in the portrayal of intense passions, and\r\nthe suggestion of well-defined dramatic situations. In spite of the fact\r\nthat he frequently overshot his mark, it does not make his works one\r\nwhit less astonishing. An uncompromising champion of what has been\r\ndubbed \"programme\" music, he thought it legitimate to force the\r\nimagination of the hearer to dwell on exterior scenes during the\r\nprogress of the music, and to distress the mind in its attempt to find\r\nan exact relation between the text and the music. The most perfect\r\nspecimens of the works of Berlioz, however, are those in which the music\r\nspeaks for itself, such as the \"Scène aux Champs,\" and the \"Marche au\r\nSupplice,\" in the \"Symphonie Fantastique,\" the \"Marche des Pèlerins,\" in\r\n\"Harold\"; the overtures to \"King Lear,\" \"Benvenuto Cellini,\" \"Carnaval\r\nRomain,\" \"Le Corsaire,\" \"Les Francs Juges,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAs a master of the orchestra, no one has been the equal of Berlioz in\r\nthe whole history of music, not even Beethoven or Wagner. He treats the\r\norchestra with the absolute daring and mastery exercised by Paganini\r\nover the violin, and by Liszt over the piano. No one has showed so deep\r\nan insight into the individuality of each instrument, its resources, the\r\nextent to which its capabilities could be carried. Between the phrase\r\nand the instrument, or group of instruments, the equality is perfect;\r\nand independent of this power, made up equally of instinct and\r\nknowledge, this composer shows a sense of orchestral color in combining\r\nsingle instruments so as to form groups, or in the combination of\r\nseveral separate groups of instruments by which he has produced the most\r\nnovel and beautiful effects--effects not found in other composers.\r\nThe originality and variety of his rhythms, the perfection of his\r\ninstrumentation, have never been disputed even by his opponents. In many\r\nof his works, especially those of a religious character, there is a\r\nCyclopean bigness of instrumental means used, entirely beyond parallel\r\nin art. Like the Titans of old, he would scale the very heavens in\r\nhis daring. In one of his works he does not hesitate to use three\r\norchestras, three choruses (all of full dimensions), four organs, and\r\na triple quartet. The conceptions of Berlioz were so grandiose that he\r\nsometimes disdained detail, and the result was that more than one of his\r\ncompositions have rugged grandeur at the expense of symmetry and balance\r\nof form.\r\n\r\nYet, when he chose, Berlioz could write the most exquisite and dainty\r\nlyrics possible. What could be more exquisitely tender than many of\r\nhis songs and romances, and various of the airs and choral pieces\r\nfrom \"Beatrice et Benedict,\" from \"Nuits d'Été,\" \"Irlande,\" and from\r\n\"L'Enfance du Christ\"?\r\n\r\nBerlioz in his entirety, as man and composer, was a most extraordinary\r\nbeing, to whom the ordinary scale of measure can hardly be applied.\r\nThough he founded no new school, he pushed to a fuller development the\r\npossibilities to which Beethoven reached out in the Ninth Symphony.\r\nHe was the great _virtuoso_ on the orchestra, and on this Briarean\r\ninstrument he played with the most amazing skill. Others have surpassed\r\nhim in the richness of the musical substance out of which their\r\ntone-pictures are woven, in symmetry of form, in finish of detail; but\r\nno one has ever equaled him in that absolute mastery over instruments,\r\nby which a hundred become as plastic and flexible as one, and are made\r\nto embody every phase of the composer's thought with that warmth of\r\ncolor and precision of form long believed to be necessarily confined to\r\nthe sister arts.\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
